00:00:28.88 --> 00:00:34.36 At the first jockel live actually was it wasn't jockel. I was New York City
00:00:34.36 --> 00:00:39.28 Oh, yeah, and someone someone said something you like oh, are you nervous?
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:42.88 And you said well a little bit and then
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.48 Well, okay, I'm I'm trying to craft the conversation
00:00:47.60 --> 00:00:51.52 Maybe that didn't happen the way you're looking at me like it. I'm talking to you and
00:00:52.16 --> 00:00:58.36 Somehow you rehearsed your lines. No, no, you were it was it was tie was making the video and

00:01:25.24 --> 00:01:30.000 I was like good evening it like I jammed it up. I think in that weird you have one job one
00:01:34.72 --> 00:01:39.22 Yes, is the pressure great run you right it goes words right exactly
00:01:40.92 --> 00:01:46.60 Well, what was crazy about that? Well, it's like no you didn't know what I was gonna talk about no and the only person that knew
00:01:46.60 --> 00:01:51.68 I was gonna talk about was me and I knew I was gonna go out there and talk about Seth and it was gonna be like as
00:01:51.68 --> 00:01:58.06 Heart of a thing as I could possibly have to go and talk about and so you're all kind of hey
00:01:58.06 --> 00:02:03.88 You know cool. This is a crowd and it'll be fun and I'm sitting there thinking how am I gonna get through this?
00:02:03.88 --> 00:02:08.68 Yeah, and then I do get through my part and then you screw up your part
00:02:11.72 --> 00:02:16.52 Thankfully in a way I screwed up my part before you did your part
00:02:16.52 --> 00:02:21.74 You know I knew something was kind of I don't want to say off because it wasn't off
00:02:21.74 --> 00:02:25.42 But something was a little bit different when you rolled up like when you came on to the stage
00:02:25.76 --> 00:02:27.76 That's when you wait a second but
00:02:29.36 --> 00:02:34.72 Something's different right now because I didn't know what was going on at that time. Yeah, but which is weird
00:02:35.44 --> 00:02:39.38 I didn't give you any heads up at all. No, sir. You did not what a savage
00:02:40.48 --> 00:02:43.84 So hey man, it's real. Yeah, you did that to me at the the jockel live

00:02:55.60 --> 00:02:58.84 No, it was I was like balling my eyes out the back of
00:02:59.32 --> 00:03:01.000 Actually, okay, look to be afterwards
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.52 You go how about a heads up next time and I go sorry bro. You go I was openly weeping

00:03:22.86 --> 00:03:28.06 Thing that you yeah, you've got going on right? Okay, I guess you can just gargle rocks or
00:03:28.58 --> 00:03:34.32 The Ellen scream of the sound of gunfire. Do you remember when we were in South Africa on the radio? I do
00:03:34.32 --> 00:03:40.52 If you ever shared that story with anyone in your life particularly the person that you're married to
00:03:41.28 --> 00:03:45.74 We're on this radio show because they pop in the radio show in South Africa and you know
00:03:45.74 --> 00:03:48.90 We're getting interviewed about leadership and we're talking and these
00:03:49.60 --> 00:03:54.08 These females are calling into the show and they're like that man's voice is amazing
00:03:54.56 --> 00:03:59.32 What I can't do this out the African voice, but it was it was pretty funny wait
00:03:59.32 --> 00:04:02.32 That's but is that public that that interview?
00:04:02.32 --> 00:04:09.12 You too great. Maybe I think I saw that. It was pretty funny. I remember you guys being in South Africa on the
00:04:09.12 --> 00:04:11.32 In that radio show and it's on YouTube
00:04:11.32 --> 00:04:16.20 Okay, there you go. We can look it up. There you go. We can tag it. Wait, what do they say?
00:04:16.56 --> 00:04:22.44 We'll put that in the show notes. I would say that but I know that there's a limited chance of you putting anything in the show notes
00:04:24.44 --> 00:04:27.40 I don't know it's on the on the podcast
00:04:27.40 --> 00:04:33.16 You know you can put YouTube the description for also people do that on you know
00:04:33.56 --> 00:04:38.60 When people put a podcast on iTunes for instance, you can put links in their echo
00:04:39.64 --> 00:04:42.12 Yeah, you can put them in the show notes
00:04:42.40 --> 00:04:47.68 So people say I'll link it in the show notes. All right, so I'm not making any
00:04:48.28 --> 00:04:50.92 Remote promises about anything being the show notes
00:04:51.56 --> 00:04:54.76 Yes, I guess you can use your Google fingers if you want to see a
00:04:54.76 --> 00:04:57.96 Lave getting a complemented by
00:04:59.08 --> 00:05:04.32 the ladies of South Africa or what's they some of the ladies in South Africa? It's on YouTube
00:05:04.32 --> 00:05:08.16 It's it's it's out there. All right, so now that we've gotten through that
00:05:11.60 --> 00:05:16.16 Let's get into the subject of the night the subject of the night is the squad leader makes a difference
00:05:18.28 --> 00:05:23.28 The squad leader makes a difference and with decentralized command
00:05:23.28 --> 00:05:26.56 Which is the fourth law of combat leadership?
00:05:27.76 --> 00:05:29.76 This is
00:05:30.08 --> 00:05:36.92 Undisputable it's undisputable that the squad leader makes a difference because with decentralized command everybody leads
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000 you want everybody to be a leader and
00:05:42.04 --> 00:05:44.04 lately
00:05:44.04 --> 00:05:49.88 I've been talking about the fact that the purest and highest form of decentralized command is actually culture
00:05:49.88 --> 00:05:53.88 And if you have a strong culture inside of an organization
00:05:54.92 --> 00:06:03.28 Then the people in the organization at any level can make decisions based on the culture of the organization
00:06:03.80 --> 00:06:07.88 Just based on the culture they can figure out what to do if you have a strong culture
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.44 If it's we take care of the customer think of how many decisions you can make if you know
00:06:14.44 --> 00:06:18.82 Hey, our our culture is to take care of the customer you can make all kinds of decisions if
00:06:19.82 --> 00:06:22.82 Your culture is we have the highest quality
00:06:23.44 --> 00:06:30.78 We make the highest quality product. I don't should I cut the corner here? No, you shouldn't should I should I get a little cheaper
00:06:32.12 --> 00:06:34.44 material to put in here? No, you shouldn't we make the highest
00:06:35.28 --> 00:06:39.08 Quality product which means that culture drives decision making
00:06:39.08 --> 00:06:45.60 We have the best value we give the best value. Oh, what does that mean? We're gonna try and maintain that low price
00:06:45.60 --> 00:06:51.08 We can make decisions. You know what we can shave off a little bit of money there and we can get a better value for our clients
00:06:51.08 --> 00:06:53.08 So you can make all kinds of decisions with that and
00:06:54.44 --> 00:06:56.44 The military has culture to and
00:06:58.04 --> 00:07:06.56 Units in the military different units in the military right down to the platoon level have a culture that can also drive decision making
00:07:06.56 --> 00:07:10.94 It can drive good decision making actually and
00:07:12.14 --> 00:07:18.16 It can also make it can also drive bad decision making right if you have bad culture it can actually drive
00:07:18.68 --> 00:07:20.68 bad decision making
00:07:20.68 --> 00:07:22.32 so
00:07:22.32 --> 00:07:30.32 Real obvious example bad culture is a bad culture of blaming others of not taking ownership and if you're not taking ownership
00:07:30.32 --> 00:07:32.32 You have a culture where nothing ever gets fixed
00:07:33.32 --> 00:07:35.72 That's what's happening. So if our culture is
00:07:35.72 --> 00:07:40.12 To blame everyone else. We're not we're not gonna improve. We're not gonna get any better obviously
00:07:41.80 --> 00:07:45.56 Again, if we have a culture where we're cutting corners and what about it?
00:07:47.24 --> 00:07:49.24 That's what accidents happen
00:07:50.36 --> 00:07:53.72 If we have a culture where we're looking out for me
00:07:55.16 --> 00:07:57.88 Right, that's looking out for for a jocco
00:07:57.88 --> 00:08:05.44 Well, then we're not covered moving for each other not there to cover move for someone that needs help
00:08:05.44 --> 00:08:07.76 If I've got a culture of micro management
00:08:07.76 --> 00:08:13.20 I guess what no one's gonna have any initiative because the culture isn't what we'll sit around and wait and get told what to do
00:08:13.96 --> 00:08:15.96 So you can see how these cultures
00:08:16.12 --> 00:08:20.52 Drive bad decision making of course culture can also drive a good decision making
00:08:21.52 --> 00:08:26.88 Right with with good culture if you've got good culture if you've got a culture of ownership
00:08:26.88 --> 00:08:32.24 If everyone in your team has got the culture where hey, we take ownership. We solve problems guess what
00:08:33.36 --> 00:08:37.28 That culture's gonna drive people to say hey, you know what that's my fault. Let me fix it
00:08:37.68 --> 00:08:39.36 So we want that culture of
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.36 Ownership we want the culture where people don't cut corners. We want the culture where people look out for their teammates
00:08:45.84 --> 00:08:50.96 We want culture where people are empowered and they make things happen
00:08:50.96 --> 00:08:58.88 So it's it's real obvious how powerful culture can be and I think sometimes people think about culture as
00:09:01.68 --> 00:09:03.68 Is like non-clonifiable
00:09:03.68 --> 00:09:10.56 Well, you know they have a good culture, but what is that really what does that produce what does that give you the reality is if you have good culture
00:09:10.56 --> 00:09:17.04 It is extremely powerful. It's the highest form of decentralized command and decentralized command is extremely powerful in its own right
00:09:17.04 --> 00:09:20.000 So then the question becomes okay
00:09:20.96 --> 00:09:22.96 How do we actually create culture?
00:09:24.32 --> 00:09:26.32 How do we do that? How are we gonna create culture?
00:09:27.52 --> 00:09:29.52 And the answer is if you
00:09:30.48 --> 00:09:39.04 Think about it for a little bit the answers that you create culture the same way that culture has always been created how how does culture get created?
00:09:40.80 --> 00:09:42.80 We have to tell the story
00:09:42.80 --> 00:09:51.28 We have to have we have to we have to share this story. We have to explain what we've been through what we've done together
00:09:51.60 --> 00:09:57.84 Who we are what our history is what we stand for and actually and actually why we stand for that
00:09:58.88 --> 00:10:03.76 And if you can carry on that story if you can tell that powerful story you can create a culture
00:10:07.04 --> 00:10:08.56 Now
00:10:08.56 --> 00:10:10.56 We can't just make the story up
00:10:10.56 --> 00:10:15.20 We can't just we can't we can't just fabricate us to actually no
00:10:16.40 --> 00:10:22.64 We actually can't you actually can't just create a a a story almost out of thin air and
00:10:23.68 --> 00:10:25.68 if you
00:10:25.84 --> 00:10:28.48 If you use that story if you use that lie
00:10:29.60 --> 00:10:34.72 To replace the story and you tell that lie for long enough it becomes the truth right 1984
00:10:35.52 --> 00:10:37.84 That's exactly what that's the whole premise of 1984
00:10:37.84 --> 00:10:39.84 We control
00:10:39.84 --> 00:10:44.48 He who controls what is it who controls the past controls the president who controls the present controls the future?
00:10:44.96 --> 00:10:48.48 No, who controls the present controls the past and who controls the past controls the future?
00:10:48.80 --> 00:10:54.16 Whatever order you want to put those in if I can convince you that this is the story
00:10:54.16 --> 00:10:58.32 This is the history this is where we came from I can manipulate the culture
00:10:59.12 --> 00:11:02.16 So so it actually can be done
00:11:02.16 --> 00:11:11.28 but that takes like a massive kind of universal propaganda machine to make that happen
00:11:13.84 --> 00:11:19.20 And I think the the better way to do that and what we should do and what good meters do is to
00:11:20.24 --> 00:11:22.24 base the story
00:11:22.80 --> 00:11:25.92 That develops into our culture based that obviously based in the truth
00:11:25.92 --> 00:11:30.32 That's the most powerful way to create a culture
00:11:32.80 --> 00:11:36.80 Is to tell that truthful story to hold up those examples
00:11:37.84 --> 00:11:43.12 From the path from the past those those values that got us to where we are
00:11:44.48 --> 00:11:51.44 Those heroes that stood for those values you tell that story and that becomes the culture
00:11:51.44 --> 00:11:55.52 And one of the strongest
00:11:56.56 --> 00:11:58.56 cultures
00:11:58.56 --> 00:12:01.76 that I've ever been around is the culture of
00:12:02.72 --> 00:12:04.000 the United States Marine Corps
00:12:06.80 --> 00:12:09.04 And they do it in a bunch of different ways
00:12:10.56 --> 00:12:12.96 But what we're going to talk about today
00:12:12.96 --> 00:12:20.88 is a shining example it's a shining example of how to create culture because they have a manual
00:12:21.76 --> 00:12:26.08 They have a manual the manual is called the squad leader makes a difference
00:12:28.40 --> 00:12:36.88 Think about this black belt move they make a they make a document that's called the squad leader makes a difference
00:12:36.88 --> 00:12:42.48 So obviously they want to have decentralized command they want their squad leaders to step up and lead
00:12:42.80 --> 00:12:47.20 So they make a whole manual that's called the squad leader makes a difference
00:12:50.08 --> 00:12:55.92 And it goes further to set the culture inside the document itself because in this book
00:12:57.20 --> 00:13:02.88 The squad leader makes a difference which is subtitles subtitled readings on combat at the squad level
00:13:02.88 --> 00:13:06.56 And it's from the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab
00:13:07.28 --> 00:13:13.68 Which is a legit name for something at Quantico. It's put this thing was put together in 1998 by a couple of lieutenant's
00:13:15.44 --> 00:13:21.36 M.M. Obaldi no idea how to pronounce your name. I apologize and a M. O' Terror
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.88 So these guys put together this manual and you're going to see that what it is actually doing is
00:13:26.88 --> 00:13:34.08 is telling these stories and building a culture of decentralized command
00:13:34.88 --> 00:13:39.28 Where everyone is a leader and the squad leaders can make a difference
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.64 Lave I was thinking when you were at the Naval Academy
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.88 What examples how was that culture like when when you looked at the Marine Corps?
00:13:48.88 --> 00:13:57.28 Or did that culture permeate into the young Lave Babin brain and pull you in that direction a little bit?
00:13:58.32 --> 00:14:00.72 Yeah for sure. I mean we had some outstanding
00:14:01.12 --> 00:14:02.40 Not-convition officers
00:14:02.40 --> 00:14:06.48 Sergeant Major that ran our PT and he'd come running by at 4 o'clock at the morning and
00:14:07.12 --> 00:14:09.52 yelling for the brigade of M.M. to get up
00:14:11.52 --> 00:14:13.52 Yeah, there was a lot of that was
00:14:13.52 --> 00:14:17.28 In fact our member owned parents
00:14:17.52 --> 00:14:20.08 Parents weekend so you go through like the pleaps summer
00:14:20.08 --> 00:14:23.52 Which is so you just show up in the Naval Academy. It's kind of boot camp in the Naval Academy
00:14:23.52 --> 00:14:25.12 It's pleap we call pleaps summer
00:14:25.12 --> 00:14:28.16 So you show up in the running all these midshipmen to boot camp
00:14:28.72 --> 00:14:32.96 You're kind of going to that boot camp style and toward the end of that your parents show up for
00:14:32.96 --> 00:14:37.20 Parents weekend and they can visit for a few days and see you and then they take off but
00:14:37.20 --> 00:14:45.12 He was like talking to the parents who he's who he's from Maine and so you know
00:14:45.12 --> 00:14:48.96 If you feel raised their hand like oh yeah he's from Maine. He's like I'm from Maine too the main part of
00:14:48.96 --> 00:14:50.96 Paras Island
00:14:51.52 --> 00:14:56.32 And it just starts laughing. It was just you know that was certainly instilled in Austin and
00:14:56.32 --> 00:15:00.56 Everyone has to go through you know whether you're gonna be a ship driver in the Navy or some
00:15:00.56 --> 00:15:03.52 Marines or fireplanes or whatever you have to go through
00:15:03.52 --> 00:15:08.80 You know at least at least a two or three week program that's kind of like OCS
00:15:09.52 --> 00:15:11.52 Down in Quantico
00:15:11.52 --> 00:15:16.32 I mean they they do it at OCS in Quantico for the Marine Corps see you get a taste of that regardless and
00:15:16.56 --> 00:15:20.64 So that whole the whole thing of every Marine arrive woman and putting folks through that was
00:15:21.20 --> 00:15:24.48 It was very appealing to me and I went there because I wanted to be a seal
00:15:25.36 --> 00:15:31.04 But certainly Marine ground it was my second choice. Yeah, I did not get selected for
00:15:31.04 --> 00:15:33.04 Dang um
00:15:34.32 --> 00:15:41.12 Two things isn't it interesting the way that just saying that this guy would run by it for a clock in the morning
00:15:41.36 --> 00:15:43.36 Just makes you think good to go
00:15:44.96 --> 00:15:49.60 That's number one. I would always go through Oster Canada School which is also run by
00:15:49.60 --> 00:15:52.72 Well the Marine Corps is are the are the children's structures and
00:15:53.60 --> 00:15:58.16 We would we're we're going for a run and every day we'd run through like a
00:15:58.16 --> 00:16:04.72 Like a officer real officer housing where the officers that were stationed in Pensacola lived and you know
00:16:04.72 --> 00:16:08.72 Every day we'd be singing cadence and then you go through there and you have to get quiet and they would just do like a quiet
00:16:09.28 --> 00:16:14.72 Little cadence just to keep you in step and then you'd get through and then you start singing again and you know it'd be four or five o'clock in the morning or whatever
00:16:15.60 --> 00:16:17.52 So one time we got this this one
00:16:17.52 --> 00:16:21.68 Jolensh Doctor wasn't my normal Jolensh Doctor. It was this other Jolensh Doctor took us for a run and he was
00:16:22.16 --> 00:16:27.84 He was new and he was all kinds of fired up and so we so we get to that area and he like
00:16:27.84 --> 00:16:29.84 It gets real quiet and so you know
00:16:29.84 --> 00:16:35.20 He's saying whatever the cadence was and then all of a sudden he he sings as the cadence
00:16:35.20 --> 00:16:42.16 He's like get out of the rack like quiet and we're all like get out of the rack and he's like get out of the rack and we're like get out of the rack
00:16:42.16 --> 00:16:45.84 And he get out of the rack and so we're five o'clock in the morning
00:16:45.84 --> 00:16:49.12 Run by all these officers housing and by the end. We're just
00:16:49.68 --> 00:16:52.88 The rack and just screaming and that was a good time
00:16:52.88 --> 00:17:00.24 I was like hmm, so that's what the Marine Corps does that's what the Marine Corps does they make a human being say
00:17:00.24 --> 00:17:06.000 I'm from Maine the main part of Paris Island that's what the Marine Corps does and we must
00:17:06.64 --> 00:17:11.76 Salute them for that so this book is one of those things right when I'm on my
00:17:13.92 --> 00:17:16.16 When I'm on my tri-trails
00:17:16.16 --> 00:17:21.76 Through the world I stumble upon these things this is one of those things. I saw that title
00:17:21.76 --> 00:17:24.48 And like you've got to be kidding me what is this?
00:17:25.28 --> 00:17:26.64 So
00:17:26.64 --> 00:17:32.16 The squad leader makes a difference reading on combat at the squad level volume one and by the way this is volume one
00:17:32.16 --> 00:17:35.84 I have not been able to find volume two three four five or six so
00:17:36.32 --> 00:17:42.64 Maybe these guys got sent somewhere from the Marine Corps war fighting live and didn't ever make another one
00:17:42.96 --> 00:17:44.96 But let's get into it
00:17:44.96 --> 00:17:48.48 Here's the forward in combat
00:17:50.40 --> 00:17:54.000 Sometimes when I read these things I think every single thing that I'm about to read
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.20 I just read it and stop this is one of those things so in combat
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.40 The actions of individual leaders affect the outcome of the entire battle
00:18:04.40 --> 00:18:13.92 Squad leaders make decisions and take actions which if which can affect the operational and strategic levels of war
00:18:15.36 --> 00:18:20.56 Well trained squad leaders playing important role as combat decision makers on the battlefield
00:18:21.92 --> 00:18:29.60 Leaders who show initiative judgment and courage will achieve decisive results not only at the squad level
00:18:29.76 --> 00:18:32.08 But in the broader context of battle
00:18:32.08 --> 00:18:42.80 Without competent squad leaders capable of carrying out of a commander's intent even the best plans are doomed to failure
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000 So you know
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.28 You hear about the general and the Colonel and the captain and even the gunnery sergeant
00:18:55.28 --> 00:19:01.84 You hear about the Marine Corps leadership and and yes, they're outstanding
00:19:03.20 --> 00:19:11.20 But when you're a corporal and you read this you think you know what I got to get mine too
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.60 Think of how awesome that is and and from a you know from a business perspective
00:19:17.60 --> 00:19:23.92 How how how how how how how do you what story do you tell your
00:19:24.80 --> 00:19:29.44 Employees what story do you tell the people that work inside your organization?
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.36 What story do you tell them do you tell them that that that they are decision makers?
00:19:35.44 --> 00:19:42.24 Do you tell them that their judgment and initiative will drive results at the strategic level?
00:19:42.24 --> 00:19:44.24 Do you ever tell you to team that?
00:19:44.24 --> 00:19:47.92 That's how you set the culture
00:19:50.56 --> 00:19:54.80 That you know as you as you're reading that I'm thinking about as a student of history and
00:19:55.52 --> 00:19:57.76 I love reading history books and obviously you do you know
00:19:57.76 --> 00:19:59.92 It's not some amazing books here on the podcast
00:20:00.64 --> 00:20:04.88 But we always talk about it from the big you know the big the commander the general why you read
00:20:05.68 --> 00:20:09.44 You know Julia sees her maneuvered his his or Alex end of the great did this or
00:20:10.08 --> 00:20:12.64 Napoleon did this or Pat and move disarm me here
00:20:12.64 --> 00:20:14.64 And
00:20:14.64 --> 00:20:20.40 He might have been making some overall decisions, but the army that's moving is the the front line leaders out there
00:20:20.40 --> 00:20:24.96 The squad leaders that are executing that make it happen and I love the way we do that echelon front
00:20:24.96 --> 00:20:29.60 We're our definition of leadership as everybody is a leader and you said something
00:20:30.16 --> 00:20:34.000 Recently that I hadn't thought about it that way, but we're okay
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.80 Who is actually a leader if you interact with humans in some way and actually need them to go in a direction and work together
00:20:40.80 --> 00:20:46.80 provide a resource or are support then you actually are a leader and I think when you see yourself that way
00:20:47.84 --> 00:20:53.04 I mean the most powerful armies in the world the most powerful teams companies in the world are gonna see themselves
00:20:53.04 --> 00:20:58.64 What everyone sees themselves a leader able saw problems and make things happen and move the team forward in the direction
00:20:58.64 --> 00:21:00.24 I need to go
00:21:00.24 --> 00:21:05.36 Yeah, that's um and that's one of the best things about this podcast is that I get to
00:21:06.24 --> 00:21:08.000 I get to read
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.80 books not written by the general not written by the admiral but written by
00:21:14.40 --> 00:21:24.24 A rifle one of Napoleon's riflemen or a machine gun or installing rod like that's what that's who we're that's who we're hearing from and what's what's what's
00:21:24.24 --> 00:21:25.92 Powerful about that is then you get to see
00:21:26.96 --> 00:21:33.04 You get to know you get to learn how that leadership is perceived by the troops on the front line
00:21:33.04 --> 00:21:39.84 I mean that that podcast that we did about style and God where you they were hearing Hitler
00:21:40.96 --> 00:21:44.000 Talk about them being gone
00:21:44.88 --> 00:21:50.08 They were still there they were surrounded they were fighting for their lives and they were hearing the broadcast of Hitler
00:21:50.08 --> 00:21:54.32 Saying it was a great sacrifice and they stood to the last man. They're like we're still here
00:21:54.80 --> 00:21:56.16 What are you doing?
00:21:56.16 --> 00:22:00.48 Give us help give us support let us let us break out no
00:22:00.48 --> 00:22:02.48 And
00:22:02.48 --> 00:22:05.92 You realize oh those those those people on the front lines
00:22:07.68 --> 00:22:10.96 They do they they make such a big difference
00:22:12.96 --> 00:22:16.32 And if you set the culture correctly they will have even more impact
00:22:20.24 --> 00:22:22.24 Goes on this
00:22:22.24 --> 00:22:28.56 This public this publication illustrates how bold imaginative squad leaders impact the outcome of a battle or campaign
00:22:28.56 --> 00:22:35.12 The historical examples here represent some of the cases in which squad leaders were able to change the course of history
00:22:37.36 --> 00:22:41.36 Did I just say a squad leader change the course of history? Yes, I did
00:22:42.24 --> 00:22:47.52 In each case the squad leader had to make a quick decision without direct orders
00:22:48.72 --> 00:22:52.72 Act independently and accept responsibility for the results
00:22:52.72 --> 00:23:02.48 Short lessons are presented at the end of each story these lessons should help you realize how important your decisions are to your Marines and your commander
00:23:03.20 --> 00:23:10.40 In combat you must think beyond the squad level you must develop opportunities for your commander to exploit
00:23:11.68 --> 00:23:19.28 Your every action must support your commanders intent you must be competent in the combat skills required
00:23:19.28 --> 00:23:21.28 of a combined arms leader
00:23:23.28 --> 00:23:27.04 You are the primary war fighter of the Marine Corps
00:23:28.64 --> 00:23:30.64 Boom
00:23:31.36 --> 00:23:33.36 Freaking legit
00:23:35.28 --> 00:23:40.80 I think about how often like how different that is right from a culture of centralized command
00:23:41.52 --> 00:23:45.52 Where the senior leaders like we owe the frontline troops just don't get it they don't know what's good
00:23:45.52 --> 00:23:47.52 They don't understand and
00:23:47.52 --> 00:23:53.92 Then the front line troops like the guys up in the ivory tower, you know the senior leaders they don't get if they don't understand what's going on here
00:23:54.40 --> 00:23:58.24 Versus it you know where people are just sitting around waiting to be told what to do versus the
00:23:58.72 --> 00:24:04.24 The team that's actually empowered to step up and lead and make things happen and that team is just unstoppable
00:24:04.80 --> 00:24:06.80 unstoppable
00:24:07.68 --> 00:24:11.52 Here's some coats that this thing starts off with the most brilliant plan
00:24:11.52 --> 00:24:19.44 Depends for its tactical execution on the squad leaders poor squad leaders may ruin the best laid plans
00:24:20.08 --> 00:24:24.16 First rate squad leaders often save badly devised plans
00:24:24.72 --> 00:24:34.08 The squad leader is the sole level of command that maintains direct contact with the men who do the actual fighting
00:24:34.08 --> 00:24:43.20 The follow's then that the squad leader is to be trained as a tactical commander and as an educator of his men
00:24:43.60 --> 00:24:45.60 that's interesting because
00:24:46.48 --> 00:24:48.48 You know when we talk about
00:24:48.64 --> 00:24:52.56 Span of control and on the battlefield, you know you can have
00:24:53.20 --> 00:24:56.08 Four five six guys and you can pretty much
00:24:56.88 --> 00:25:00.000 Control you can per you can you can you can you can make things happen
00:25:00.24 --> 00:25:02.24 You know when you've got four five six guys
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:05.44 Maybe seven it starts getting really wonky at eight
00:25:06.48 --> 00:25:12.000 But that's because you can see them they're right there you can you can move four feet and you can grab life and say hey
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.24 You can move move a little further forward you can actually just make things happen through direct supervision
00:25:18.24 --> 00:25:20.24 so that's that's
00:25:20.48 --> 00:25:26.32 That's very important to remember that these squad leaders and ones that actually have the contact to make things happen
00:25:26.32 --> 00:25:29.04 You go up one level you go from the squad to the platoon
00:25:29.04 --> 00:25:32.40 Well that puts you in commander can't get to that kid over on the left flank
00:25:32.88 --> 00:25:36.72 He can't get to that machine gunner up on that no, he's not gonna be able to get there
00:25:36.88 --> 00:25:41.68 He's not gonna be able to make it happen and that's why as you grow you have to get better at the laws of combat
00:25:41.68 --> 00:25:46.88 You have to get better decentralized command you have to get better to keep things simple you have to get better prioritize and actually you have to get better cover move
00:25:47.28 --> 00:25:48.48 Because
00:25:48.48 --> 00:25:50.48 You don't have that direct control anymore
00:25:51.04 --> 00:25:52.48 You can't just
00:25:52.48 --> 00:25:53.84 You know use your
00:25:53.84 --> 00:25:58.08 Force of will to make things happen go grab a guy you need to get over here doesn't work anymore
00:26:01.60 --> 00:26:03.60 Continuing on the
00:26:03.60 --> 00:26:09.36 IDF this guy is Israeli the IDF squad leaders are trained to command independently in the field
00:26:10.24 --> 00:26:18.16 Modern armies operate in small dispersed formations all levels of command must be trained to think and act independently
00:26:18.48 --> 00:26:23.44 Modern weapons which provide small groups of men greater fire power and flexibility of movement
00:26:23.44 --> 00:26:31.12 Call for a high standard of command at all levels and this is something that we've been able to walk through and and I apologize that it hasn't been chronological in nature
00:26:31.60 --> 00:26:33.60 but
00:26:33.60 --> 00:26:35.60 When the machine gun came
00:26:36.16 --> 00:26:40.000 We had to start using decentralized command because if we're all bunched up together
00:26:40.56 --> 00:26:45.04 We're all gonna die together. So that's when world war one towards the end of world war one
00:26:45.36 --> 00:26:49.44 We started getting decentralized command. It started having the squad like you're not gonna be with me anymore
00:26:49.76 --> 00:26:51.76 Hey, lay from we go on this mission
00:26:51.76 --> 00:26:57.68 I'm not gonna be able to give you any guidance at all as the company commander because you're gonna be
00:26:58.32 --> 00:27:00.32 400 meters away
00:27:00.32 --> 00:27:06.32 We have no radios and you just are gonna have to make things happen. You have to know what we're trying to make happen. You gotta go do it on your own
00:27:07.20 --> 00:27:08.32 So
00:27:08.32 --> 00:27:14.40 This idea that you know when you saw the the red coats right line up and we're gonna march together
00:27:14.40 --> 00:27:20.96 That's the old way of war. I mean the the Romans the failanks like all the old formations of war. I was like we're all together
00:27:21.76 --> 00:27:23.28 We can just
00:27:23.28 --> 00:27:27.76 Maintain good control over this big group easier because we're all co-located and
00:27:28.96 --> 00:27:32.80 Modern warfare brought us to hey, I'm not right there
00:27:33.76 --> 00:27:38.76 We launched on this mission and I might not see you again until the mission's complete
00:27:38.76 --> 00:27:46.92 So the people that are out there leading have to know what they're doing why they're doing it they have to understand the commanders intent
00:27:46.92 --> 00:27:50.12 And they have to take initiative to get to that goal
00:27:53.40 --> 00:27:57.64 Then he falls he concludes this with the squad leader therefore
00:27:58.76 --> 00:28:03.24 The squad leader is therefore to be trained technically as an officer not as a corporate
00:28:03.24 --> 00:28:09.72 And that's from Yigal Alon who is a field commander in these really defense force and
00:28:10.44 --> 00:28:14.44 He actually was a scout with the brids in World War II fought in Syria fought in Lebanon
00:28:15.48 --> 00:28:21.48 Founding member of the Israeli strike force so some experience
00:28:24.92 --> 00:28:29.72 First they kicked this whole thing off and this is actually a big shocker to me. They kicked this off by talking about
00:28:29.72 --> 00:28:33.72 Corporal Alvin York United States Army
00:28:34.52 --> 00:28:36.52 All right, so I
00:28:36.52 --> 00:28:46.76 Expect that this to be all Marines, but the Marine Corps is awesome and they said hey these are awesome examples of where a squad leader made a difference and we're gonna use them
00:28:50.04 --> 00:28:51.80 France
00:28:51.80 --> 00:28:54.20 1918 the
00:28:54.20 --> 00:29:00.20 Muse Argon offensive was the last important battle of the first World War on the night of
00:29:00.92 --> 00:29:06.04 September 1918 over one million American soldiers moved up to relieve the French forces on the front lines
00:29:06.60 --> 00:29:12.44 The American advance that ensued swept easily through the first two lines of German trenches and
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.20 Then progress slowed facing stiff resistance the reserve division was called up
00:29:18.20 --> 00:29:24.52 Corporal Alvin York served as an infantry man in the 82nd division
00:29:26.04 --> 00:29:30.68 York's company started across a valley at six in the morning as they began to move the company came
00:29:30.68 --> 00:29:36.36 Under heavy fire from behind a hill enemy machine guns mode down the first wave of advancing Americans
00:29:37.40 --> 00:29:44.92 No one knew where the deadly fire was coming from so York's platoon sergeant decided to take the platoon on a mission to find it
00:29:44.92 --> 00:29:50.12 The platoon found a gap in the enemy lines and circled to the rear where they thought the machine guns might be
00:29:50.68 --> 00:29:58.76 The group of Americans stumbled across two German leader bearers whom they followed back to the headquarters of the machine gun Battalion
00:29:59.56 --> 00:30:06.04 The Americans walked right into the German machine gun command post open fire and the Germans immediately surrendered
00:30:07.24 --> 00:30:14.36 Upon hearing the fire behind them the Germans that were dug in near the command post swung their weapons around and
00:30:14.36 --> 00:30:21.08 began firing at the Americans caught in the open in a hail of automatic fire the Americans instantly took casualties
00:30:22.20 --> 00:30:29.32 Corporal York took aim at the nearest machine gun about 25 yards away and killed the man behind the gun
00:30:30.20 --> 00:30:33.96 He continued to fire at each German who popped his head out of a foxhole
00:30:34.84 --> 00:30:42.20 After watching his troops being massacred by this lone sharpshooter the German major in command yelled to York
00:30:42.20 --> 00:30:46.20 If you'll stop shooting I'll make them surrender
00:30:48.36 --> 00:30:51.64 Work on your marksmanship people work on your marksmanship
00:30:53.48 --> 00:30:58.44 Within minutes the remaining American troops had captured 90 German prisoners
00:30:58.84 --> 00:31:00.84 But they were behind enemy lines
00:31:01.88 --> 00:31:05.24 Corporal York took charge and quickly organized his platoon
00:31:05.24 --> 00:31:08.92 He decided to move back towards friendly positions straight through the German lines
00:31:08.92 --> 00:31:13.08 York ordered the German prisoners to carry back the American wounded
00:31:13.64 --> 00:31:16.20 Every time the group came upon a German position
00:31:16.92 --> 00:31:21.64 York told the captured German major to order the troops to surrender
00:31:23.24 --> 00:31:27.88 The well-disciplined German soldiers never questioned the order and by the time
00:31:28.44 --> 00:31:30.60 York's small band reached friendly lines
00:31:30.92 --> 00:31:34.44 They had acquired 132 German prisoners
00:31:34.44 --> 00:31:43.80 In their wake York's platoon left 35 deserted German machine gun positions and a significant gap in the German defenses
00:31:44.60 --> 00:31:49.32 This gap which York had created was a vital element to the success of the division's advance
00:31:50.20 --> 00:31:55.32 This advance gave momentum to the American forces and contributed to the success of the offensive
00:31:58.44 --> 00:31:59.64 phenomenal
00:31:59.64 --> 00:32:01.64 Here's the lessons
00:32:01.64 --> 00:32:07.08 Corporal York was quick to exploit the opportunity which had been created
00:32:08.04 --> 00:32:14.84 He realized that his actions would affect the outcome of the battalions advance and made decisions which supported his commanders intent
00:32:15.40 --> 00:32:20.44 His strong situation awareness guided him in taking action which had decisive results
00:32:20.44 --> 00:32:25.24 You know when you think even when I think when I think of World War one soldiers
00:32:26.52 --> 00:32:29.56 You I definitely envision someone that's much more obedient
00:32:29.56 --> 00:32:34.44 than what we have in the modern all volunteer military today
00:32:34.52 --> 00:32:43.08 Right, you've got someone to say I mean, I always say the whole world was more obedient right you had a much more stringent class structure in America
00:32:43.56 --> 00:32:49.40 You had the much further separation between the officers and the enlisted and
00:32:50.28 --> 00:32:52.28 So for this kid
00:32:53.24 --> 00:32:55.48 To be like oh I got this
00:32:55.48 --> 00:33:02.84 It's incredible it's incredible to show that kind of initiative and I think the fact that it was in World War one is even more incredible
00:33:05.32 --> 00:33:09.48 Think about what what would happen if he was just standing around waiting to be told what to do in that situation though
00:33:09.56 --> 00:33:15.96 Which is what so many leaders we work with think is the right call like you should just wait to be told what to do and
00:33:16.36 --> 00:33:23.16 Then do you know carry on orders without question and and he would just be standing there waiting to be told what to do and and they would fail
00:33:23.16 --> 00:33:29.32 And maybe the whole offensive fails as a result instead of someone who actually understands the why understands the commanders
00:33:29.32 --> 00:33:34.44 Intent and the purpose of knowing what what they're trying to do and can take the initiative to go make things happen
00:33:34.52 --> 00:33:40.36 Yeah, you know what I often say and I'm about I don't want yes, man, right?
00:33:40.36 --> 00:33:43.08 I don't know if someone that's just like yep, hey sounds good. Jocco
00:33:43.72 --> 00:33:47.40 Sounds great. You know you want someone that's gonna push back and like I haven't agree with that wait what about this
00:33:48.20 --> 00:33:49.88 Take that one step further
00:33:49.88 --> 00:33:55.88 It's like I want someone that's just gonna figure out what to do and go freaking executed right that's what we want
00:33:56.76 --> 00:33:59.88 That's what we're trying that's what we want that's what we're trying to grow this we're trying to
00:34:00.76 --> 00:34:05.000 Develop in our support and leadership is that they're gonna look
00:34:06.20 --> 00:34:12.60 Even look beyond even look beyond what I can see and say oh I bed if I did this it would be a good move and
00:34:13.40 --> 00:34:16.04 Maybe they're batting 80 percent. I'm good with that
00:34:16.04 --> 00:34:22.20 I'd rather have somebody batting 80 percent on 80 percent good moves that took initiative and made things happen and 20 percent of the time
00:34:22.20 --> 00:34:25.32 I got to go oh life hey hold what you got man. Don't go over there yet
00:34:26.28 --> 00:34:28.28 Much rather have that
00:34:28.12 --> 00:34:29.56 Initiative
00:34:29.80 --> 00:34:35.56 But that's some you've you've helped me with as well though with because I think it's a hard thing for a lot of leaders to accept
00:34:35.56 --> 00:34:38.36 Because like well, you know we got to come up with the right solution. We don't want to make mistakes
00:34:38.36 --> 00:34:40.36 And we want to move forward and
00:34:40.92 --> 00:34:43.24 When you're you're like less than 80 percent
00:34:43.24 --> 00:34:47.72 Solutions that go 80 percent solutions ago where we're never gonna have a perfect plan
00:34:47.96 --> 00:34:50.92 So let's let's get the plan as close you know
00:34:51.56 --> 00:34:56.76 In a good direction and then execute an execute an and have the initiative BD fall aggressive
00:34:57.48 --> 00:35:01.32 I think I think that's I know it can stifle me and I've struggled with that
00:35:01.64 --> 00:35:05.64 And I'm not executing because I'm trying to get it to the 97 percent solution
00:35:06.04 --> 00:35:11.08 Like listen 80 percent solution start moving things forward execute and I think that's very empowering to think about that
00:35:11.08 --> 00:35:14.52 You don't have to have the perfect plan. Yeah. You gotta just go yeah very
00:35:14.84 --> 00:35:17.24 Librating to be like oh, yeah, I don't care about that
00:35:17.88 --> 00:35:20.04 Hey, well, what we might not be oh, yeah, I don't care
00:35:20.84 --> 00:35:22.92 You know we well, what if you don't care about that
00:35:23.56 --> 00:35:26.04 suits that that they'll over there. Yeah get there
00:35:27.48 --> 00:35:32.12 Well, do you want me to have a logistics not a care about that? I want well, do you want me to do it in the data?
00:35:32.12 --> 00:35:33.16 I don't care
00:35:33.64 --> 00:35:35.88 Well, do you want no, I don't care when you get that hill
00:35:35.88 --> 00:35:41.16 Okay, but let's do it the point I'm making here though is is you know
00:35:42.52 --> 00:35:45.24 Even whether it's actual on front or working together and task in a bruiser
00:35:46.36 --> 00:35:48.84 In you know there can be something like in my mind
00:35:48.84 --> 00:35:52.76 Real make hey, you know tacos really good at this and I got to make sure the jockel under you know has
00:35:53.24 --> 00:35:59.48 Like this is the right plan and it's gonna meet every single thing that you know he wants to do so you start putting these self-imposed restrictions
00:36:00.12 --> 00:36:01.08 Instead of like
00:36:01.08 --> 00:36:07.40 Well, you're like hey man 80% solutions go real let's execute and that that's it's super liberating to think about it that way
00:36:07.40 --> 00:36:10.04 And you realize like hey, what I thought you know
00:36:10.04 --> 00:36:13.24 I've got to get this thing perfect so you know joccos like yeah, that's good
00:36:13.24 --> 00:36:19.56 I actually don't and I'm actually I'm actually failing if I'm not executing and I'm I'm sitting here trying to come up with a perfect plan
00:36:19.56 --> 00:36:22.52 Yeah, there's some report you were trying to get and
00:36:23.64 --> 00:36:29.72 You were like hey, you know, I haven't gotten you this report because I can't quite figure out this little detail at the end
00:36:29.72 --> 00:36:32.36 to make sure that it's 100% and I just I
00:36:33.08 --> 00:36:39.64 I'm just not getting it to you because I don't want it to be inaccurate and I don't want to have you like pissed and I was like
00:36:40.60 --> 00:36:41.64 Bro
00:36:41.64 --> 00:36:48.12 Actually, I'd really exact I should have I ever sweated you for the details on anything in the past 15 years
00:36:48.44 --> 00:36:51.96 I just flooded you you kind of you get you tilted you had a little bit new it
00:36:53.16 --> 00:36:57.64 Nope, and I was like why do you think I'm gonna start sweat these little like literally in
00:36:57.64 --> 00:36:59.64 Mean
00:36:59.64 --> 00:37:07.000 Meaningless a details and you're like Roger amenity at cool got it so no factor and that's that is a great example
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.40 though because here I am doing about trying to put together a multi page report and you're like hey bro
00:37:11.40 --> 00:37:15.24 Just send me a just just say hey, I don't have the I don't have all the information yet
00:37:15.24 --> 00:37:20.20 Here's what I think we're doing here's kind of the general you know direction we should go and as soon as you say that I was like
00:37:21.24 --> 00:37:23.24 Just another reminder
00:37:23.24 --> 00:37:30.44 That it's self-imposed restrictions and it's it's really it can cause all kinds of problems so yeah and and obviously that means
00:37:30.44 --> 00:37:34.28 I'm doing a bad job of you know telling you what the
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.64 Parameters are of success you know from like hey can you tell me what these numbers are you're like cool
00:37:39.64 --> 00:37:44.28 Yeah, but it's gonna take me three weeks to dive into all these details if I was like hey and I
00:37:44.52 --> 00:37:50.60 You know like dude I just need to know like ballpark where we at okay got it because I can give you that in 13 minutes
00:37:50.60 --> 00:37:55.40 But you know it's the it's goes back to some of that implied
00:37:56.44 --> 00:38:01.000 implied commanders intent right because the implied commanders intent is that
00:38:01.64 --> 00:38:05.000 When I ask for something I need that thing right hey
00:38:05.48 --> 00:38:08.52 You know when Jockel asked for something because he doesn't ask for much when he asked for something
00:38:08.52 --> 00:38:14.36 He must want that thing really exact the implied intent is that I want the implied intent with me is basically
00:38:14.36 --> 00:38:17.24 I want perfection right that's that's that's a complete implied intent
00:38:17.24 --> 00:38:23.000 For some reason echoes never really picked up on that implied it. No, no, that's actually not true
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.24 If I think about it like the way there's been some things where I've seen I found out after the fact
00:38:29.56 --> 00:38:33.000 what you did to reach a level of
00:38:34.36 --> 00:38:37.80 As close as a human can get to perfection on something where I've been like
00:38:37.80 --> 00:38:43.32 I didn't expect him to do all that but he did it so that implied level of
00:38:43.32 --> 00:38:49.64 Perfection just from my own stupid personality is like enough to make someone tell you
00:38:49.64 --> 00:38:56.76 I better get this right before you know we go forward and that sucks and and I talked about it at Gettysburg
00:38:57.64 --> 00:39:00.28 It's like you've got to think about what you're implied
00:39:01.08 --> 00:39:03.08 What you're implied commanders intent is
00:39:04.68 --> 00:39:06.68 And if
00:39:06.68 --> 00:39:13.08 Especially if you're gonna ask him to do something that's outside that normal implied commanders intent and you know we talked about it with with
00:39:13.48 --> 00:39:18.60 Generally and some of his some of his subordinate leaders that hey generally was about kicking ass
00:39:19.64 --> 00:39:24.44 So we're moving here what's generally gonna want me to do he's gonna want me to kick ass go forward but
00:39:25.96 --> 00:39:30.12 He said hey you know don't go forward right now, but they get that word they're like the habit of generally
00:39:30.12 --> 00:39:32.76 I'm gonna go get some and they messed things up
00:39:32.76 --> 00:39:42.36 So you've got to pay attention to that implied commanders intent that just your personality has your own personality has a has a culture to it
00:39:42.36 --> 00:39:44.36 And you got to pay attention
00:39:45.16 --> 00:39:47.16 Scary that was a
00:39:47.16 --> 00:39:50.44 Some rare praise for echo Charles say we got to note that down take a
00:39:52.04 --> 00:39:54.04 Well deserved well deserved obviously
00:39:54.68 --> 00:39:56.68 Thanks
00:39:56.68 --> 00:39:58.68 Yeah, yeah
00:39:58.68 --> 00:40:03.72 I mean I'm thinking like the first time we ever went to like travel to do the podcast and
00:40:04.76 --> 00:40:08.92 You had like an eye expected I was like I had my fingers crossed my toes crossed
00:40:08.92 --> 00:40:13.96 I think I ears crossed open that you know all this quote all this equipment
00:40:14.44 --> 00:40:18.28 Showed up and we'd be able to you know we have some guests come in and it's gonna be
00:40:18.84 --> 00:40:25.24 There you know the time is valuable and all this stuff and I'm like thinking I hope this and yet you had it all you know in the
00:40:25.48 --> 00:40:27.48 Pelican case
00:40:27.48 --> 00:40:29.48 Everything was there I was like
00:40:29.48 --> 00:40:32.12 Right, you're the way okay square the way either which is not
00:40:32.60 --> 00:40:36.52 You know maybe what everyone expects maybe some people have a different implied
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000 So there you are
00:40:39.48 --> 00:40:40.92 All right
00:40:40.92 --> 00:40:46.76 Next one sergeant Henry and that's it I haven't even said this that that's where this whole manual is it's just
00:40:48.36 --> 00:40:51.96 Anicdotal one page stories where the squad leader makes a difference
00:40:52.92 --> 00:40:54.92 Sergeant Henry Hanakin
00:40:54.92 --> 00:40:56.92 US Marine Corps Haiti
00:40:57.40 --> 00:41:05.56 1919 following serious rebel uprisings the United States began a prolonged occupation of Haiti in 1915
00:41:07.40 --> 00:41:11.96 Charlemagne Peralta was the leader of the rebel army known as
00:41:12.52 --> 00:41:14.52 Tacos
00:41:14.52 --> 00:41:19.96 The second Marine Brigade spent several months in unsuccessful attempts to topple Charlemagne's group
00:41:19.96 --> 00:41:27.48 Henry Hanakin a sergeant in the brigade devised a bold plan to separate Charlemagne from the bulk of his troops and ambush him
00:41:28.92 --> 00:41:33.40 Sergeant Hanakin sent one of his most reliable men to become a member of the Kaco's band
00:41:34.44 --> 00:41:39.24 In a short period of time the infiltrator had earned the outlaws trust
00:41:39.48 --> 00:41:45.80 Then sergeant Hanakin had his spy feed the Kaco's location of a Marine unit that was vulnerable to attack
00:41:45.80 --> 00:41:51.96 And we'll talk about put the bait out there sends a little spy in there and says hey, there's gonna be these Marines are gonna be vulnerable to attack
00:41:52.28 --> 00:41:57.72 Hanakin spy soon returned with information of a rebel plan to attack these Marines as well as Charlemagne's
00:41:58.68 --> 00:42:00.68 Location during this attack
00:42:00.68 --> 00:42:03.48 on 31 October 1919
00:42:03.48 --> 00:42:04.84 Sergeant Hanakin led a
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:13.56 22 led 22 local militiamen in an attack on Charlemagne disguised as rebels this is you know this is freaking get it
00:42:13.56 --> 00:42:21.32 disguised as rebels Hanakin and his unit move through several guard posts and boldly walked into the unsuspecting rebel camp
00:42:22.60 --> 00:42:25.80 When he was within 15 yards of you know where the story is going
00:42:26.28 --> 00:42:33.48 It's going right where you wanted to go when he was within 15 yards of Charlemagne Sergeant Hanakin drew out his pistol and shot and killed the rebel leader
00:42:35.96 --> 00:42:39.80 In the firefight that followed dude in the firefight that followed
00:42:39.80 --> 00:42:45.96 The small rating party captured the rebel position and defended it from a series of counter attacks
00:42:46.36 --> 00:42:52.60 The Marines were the target of the rebel attack had been worn by Sergeant Hanakin of the impending strike and were well prepared for the rebel attack
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:59.80 The rebels were thoroughly defeated the morning after his act after the action Sergeant Hanakin reported his exploits to his command officer
00:42:59.80 --> 00:43:03.40 His command officer, we know what he was doing here is just out there getting after it
00:43:03.40 --> 00:43:10.44 Hanakin's actions had routed more than a thousand outlaws killed their leader in virtually shattered the entire band resistance movement in northern Haiti
00:43:11.80 --> 00:43:16.60 For his actions Sergeant Hanakin was awarded the Medal of Honor. I mean what up
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.36 Talking talking about taking advantage of tent and just running with a deep deep off aggressive to the court
00:43:24.36 --> 00:43:29.64 That is like the riskiest a bunch of act of actions, right?
00:43:29.64 --> 00:43:35.80 Hey, I'm gonna set these guys over here as bait. I'm gonna sneak in there. We're gonna dress up as rebels by the way, would I get in there?
00:43:35.80 --> 00:43:38.76 I'm just gonna shoot this guy the first chance I get
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:48.20 I wonder how do he had had he had some direction or approval from his commanding officer if that would have gotten a boot?
00:43:48.20 --> 00:43:54.28 Yeah, no that's that's too risky. Don't do it that that may have happened. You know, I every time I talk to tilt
00:43:54.28 --> 00:44:00.76 I'm like until I'm sorry if I was in charge man. I don't know if I would have improved any of your operations. I'm gonna go
00:44:01.48 --> 00:44:10.48 24 miles into Cambodia with four other guys and we're gonna sit around and wait to get attacked by a freaking division of
00:44:10.48 --> 00:44:12.48 NVA soldiers
00:44:12.48 --> 00:44:14.48 Okay, cool. Let's do it
00:44:14.48 --> 00:44:18.36 You know as I think about that though a lot of people obviously you can be too aggressive, right?
00:44:18.36 --> 00:44:22.12 We got to be deep all the grassy but not not not too aggressive not reckless and
00:44:22.12 --> 00:44:26.60 And it sounds like they they mitigated the risk they they needed to obviously it was successful
00:44:26.60 --> 00:44:33.28 You know in that regard, but I think what a lot of leaders miss is and really we we got a lot of scrutiny on on our
00:44:33.56 --> 00:44:40.42 Pretty bold aggressive operations and and Rmadi back in in 2006 is that by being default the aggressive
00:44:40.42 --> 00:44:44.88 You can actually mitigate risk group so by by going into areas where the the enemy
00:44:44.92 --> 00:44:50.000 They were in surge in neighborhoods that no no one else could get into they had no U.S. or coalition forces presence
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.36 They had no expectation we're gonna be there
00:44:52.48 --> 00:44:59.56 So we'd show up in places. They would catch them off guard. They we had the initiative. They didn't and it sounds like that's exactly what happened in that situation
00:44:59.56 --> 00:45:05.16 And I think some leaders you get to think about that look you can actually mitigate risk by being default aggressive and
00:45:05.68 --> 00:45:11.32 Something not you know you were you were all about a task get a bruiser and I think we utilized our advantage
00:45:11.60 --> 00:45:16.92 Were you in the chow hall in the in the camp marked Lee chow hall like early in the
00:45:16.92 --> 00:45:23.48 Supplement when our commanding officer was talking to me and he says you know what about all these these guys with IEDs
00:45:23.48 --> 00:45:26.48 Because I was telling that we're gonna be going on patrols and it's gonna be very dangerous
00:45:27.12 --> 00:45:32.16 And he said what are you gonna about do about these IEDs and these guys that are put 90s in the ground and I go
00:45:32.72 --> 00:45:36.32 We're gonna kill them and that was my mitigation plan
00:45:36.32 --> 00:45:39.92 Which is a very good mitigation plan get in position where you can kill those guys
00:45:39.92 --> 00:45:44.80 So you're Overwatch team sets up and you got people patrolling killed the bad guys and he was
00:45:44.80 --> 00:45:50.32 Like go kick sounds like a good plan, right and and yes, and that that's an example of
00:45:51.16 --> 00:45:53.64 How are you gonna stay safe by being aggressive?
00:45:53.92 --> 00:45:58.92 That's absolutely true. Well, just okay take the ID threat as an example
00:45:58.92 --> 00:46:02.56 Right if we're patrolling to an area where they have no expectation
00:46:02.56 --> 00:46:07.76 We're gonna be there the locals are out on the street. I mean, there's we're actually much safer for my ideas than we are
00:46:07.76 --> 00:46:11.56 If we're rolling down around rolling down the main route where they're expecting it to
00:46:11.56 --> 00:46:16.24 U.S. forces to be and that's I think that's a great example and in our CO's mind
00:46:16.24 --> 00:46:24.32 How do we do this is dangerous and and I think actually thinking it's actually less dangerous to be super aggressive and to be someplace where they have no expectation
00:46:24.32 --> 00:46:27.76 Versus them sitting back and waiting the ideas where they know we're gonna be
00:46:31.40 --> 00:46:32.40 Lessons
00:46:32.40 --> 00:46:38.000 Sergeant Hanna can displayed outstanding initiative. That's the understatement of the year and tackle proficiency
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.08 Okay, maybe that's the understatement here in devising and acting upon a plan to defeat a large rebel force his plan
00:46:44.08 --> 00:46:48.08 Support of the brigade the brigades mission in Haiti sergeant Hanna can accept a great risk
00:46:48.08 --> 00:46:53.96 But to display the courage and nerve to see his plan through his bold action achieved his decisive results with a small band of men
00:46:53.96 --> 00:46:57.96 Sergeant Hanna can was able to defeat a larger rebel force by adhering to tactical fundamentals
00:46:57.96 --> 00:47:06.48 It's 22 men main effort attack the enemy center of gravity the rebel leader without leadership the rebel force quickly disintegrated
00:47:06.48 --> 00:47:11.36 Sergeant Hanna can use the elements of surprise and deception to execute his attack
00:47:11.84 --> 00:47:17.000 Surprises one of the most important tactical fundamentals and was essential to this tactical undertaking
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:24.22 Sergeant Hanna can's actions illustrate how tactical decisions at the squad level can impact the operational
00:47:24.22 --> 00:47:28.18 Instratiic levels of war and can ultimately affect a US policy
00:47:28.92 --> 00:47:33.40 Sergeant Hanna can's attack greatly affected the balance of power and Haiti lessening the turmoil in the country
00:47:33.40 --> 00:47:39.96 It was a major step towards ending the rebellion on the island. So there you go. It's a strategic move and
00:47:40.48 --> 00:47:42.48 We always try and point out to companies that
00:47:43.24 --> 00:47:49.72 Your frontline troops can have a negative strategic impact or a positive strategic impact and it's even that's even more
00:47:50.16 --> 00:47:52.60 Accentuated in this day and age now that we have
00:47:53.16 --> 00:47:56.32 Social media and you can have one employee at one of your stores
00:47:56.68 --> 00:47:59.76 Either do something horrible and and really
00:47:59.76 --> 00:48:03.72 Damage a reputation or do something heroic and really help your reputation
00:48:04.48 --> 00:48:06.48 So do you have you in place the culture?
00:48:07.52 --> 00:48:14.92 That's going to drive those frontline people to do something heroic or have you got a culture where they're gonna be driven to do something horrible?
00:48:15.56 --> 00:48:19.04 I don't know that's on you your team
00:48:20.84 --> 00:48:25.08 The prospect of surprise is always the surest and guarantee of victory
00:48:25.08 --> 00:48:31.80 That's from Vaughan Melan thin who's a world war two general hero of the book
00:48:32.64 --> 00:48:36.20 Panzer battles which we haven't gotten to yet on the podcast
00:48:36.68 --> 00:48:41.46 We'll get there no tactical action should ever be undertaken without the element of surprise
00:48:42.36 --> 00:48:44.36 Speaking of Germans
00:48:44.36 --> 00:48:49.56 This here I already thought this book was gonna be about Marines and now we already have army marine
00:48:49.56 --> 00:48:52.28 I certainly thought it was gonna be about Americans
00:48:52.28 --> 00:48:56.28 This is about a German so the Marine Corps attitude is wide open
00:48:57.56 --> 00:48:59.56 Sergeant Wensel
00:48:59.56 --> 00:49:06.36 German army Belgium 1940 the German plan to invade France included the invasion of Belgium and Holland the French had not
00:49:06.36 --> 00:49:11.24 Defeated their border with Belgium leaving it open to attack the Belgians however
00:49:11.24 --> 00:49:18.84 Had constructed a series of forts along the canals throughout the countryside the most formidable of these was even a male
00:49:18.84 --> 00:49:28.44 Manned by 1200 Belgian soldiers the powerful guns of even a male commanded the eastern approaches to the Belgian border
00:49:28.76 --> 00:49:32.12 If this fortress was not eliminated the German army would have
00:49:32.84 --> 00:49:40.12 Significant difficulty crossing the border the Belgian border Sergeant Wensel was a member of Germany's parachute forces
00:49:41.64 --> 00:49:44.92 Must've been rad being a Paris trooper in World War II
00:49:44.92 --> 00:49:52.60 You're the cutting edge of tech. I mean what a few years earlier. It wasn't even idea that you could hawk a person out of a plane with a
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:53.88 piece of
00:49:53.88 --> 00:49:56.20 Free pizza cloth above them and they'd live
00:49:57.56 --> 00:50:02.28 And here they are just doing assaults this one they weren't parachuteing actually on ten May
00:50:02.60 --> 00:50:04.04 1940 his parachute company
00:50:04.12 --> 00:50:13.32 Daringly landed on the top of even a male in gliders with the mission of silencing the guns of the fortress in order to allow the German army to capture bridges to the east
00:50:13.32 --> 00:50:19.24 When Sergeant Wensel landed atop the fortress he realized his commanding officer's glider had not made it to the objective
00:50:20.12 --> 00:50:23.24 This left Sergeant Wensel in command of 80 parachutists
00:50:24.44 --> 00:50:31.08 In four man teams the Germans used flame throwers and special shaped charges to attack each gun turret
00:50:31.24 --> 00:50:37.48 Sergeant Wensel commanded his unit from a captured pill box the situation became tenuous when the Belgians prevented the German
00:50:37.80 --> 00:50:42.92 Reinforcements from arriving by blowing the bridge on the main route of the ground attack the parachute
00:50:42.92 --> 00:50:48.84 Persword caught off the Belgians were also calling artillery on the Germans and enemy infantry could be seen
00:50:48.84 --> 00:50:52.68 Preparing to counter attack the pair troopers and as I was reading a self-saclates again
00:50:52.68 --> 00:50:55.24 Enemy who we talked about there's arguing about the Belgians
00:50:56.20 --> 00:50:58.20 Sergeant Wensel
00:50:58.20 --> 00:51:04.20 Continued to lead the parachutists for three more hours as each Belgian gun position was eliminated after the sun had set
00:51:04.20 --> 00:51:06.76 Sergeant Wensel linked up with German forces from the east
00:51:06.76 --> 00:51:13.72 Even a male head fallen Sergeant Wensel's actions allowed German forces approaching from the east to advance
00:51:13.88 --> 00:51:17.80 Unmoles to across the canals when a force of 80 men he had subdued
00:51:18.28 --> 00:51:20.28 1200 of the enemy
00:51:23.16 --> 00:51:29.80 The defense of Belgium was broken and the German army was able to rapidly defeat Belgium and move into France
00:51:29.80 --> 00:51:37.48 The northern wing of the German army rapidly outfack flanked the French army and brought about a defeat the French forces in a mere six weeks
00:51:37.72 --> 00:51:42.44 For his heroic actions and outstanding leadership as Sergeant Wensel was awarded the Knights cross
00:51:44.28 --> 00:51:46.28 When you think about
00:51:46.28 --> 00:51:47.80 80 men
00:51:47.80 --> 00:51:49.80 beating one thousand two hundred
00:51:50.20 --> 00:51:53.32 I was sitting there and I was in my mind of thinking like how do you do that but then
00:51:54.28 --> 00:51:55.32 you
00:51:55.32 --> 00:51:57.32 I probably heard me say
00:51:57.32 --> 00:52:04.36 Don't dig in don't get in a position where you can't get out of well if you set up a fort where you're all in bunker positions
00:52:04.68 --> 00:52:11.16 And all of a sudden the enemy gets in there and they can maneuver really quickly and you're stuck in this pill box or you're stuck in this gun in placement
00:52:12.20 --> 00:52:17.24 While the other while you're bad guys the people are trying to kill you are running around and sneaking around and can get
00:52:17.48 --> 00:52:22.04 Free fields of fire because you're stuck in this box. That's that's in my mind how it happens
00:52:22.04 --> 00:52:29.40 I you do have to recognize that even a male was probably the most impregnable force fortress in the monster
00:52:29.40 --> 00:52:36.12 No, I'm freaking monster. It was like I think a 200 foot high walls along the ground. I mean, so they they probably felt like completely safe
00:52:36.60 --> 00:52:38.60 No factor. There's no way the Germans are coming
00:52:38.92 --> 00:52:42.84 But I think what's crazy and we talked about the almost surprise in that situation
00:52:44.28 --> 00:52:48.76 The Germans knew they were coming. I mean, there was an attack coming. Obviously the Germans knew they were coming
00:52:48.76 --> 00:52:54.76 They had every expo in the Belgians knew that they were coming. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The Belgians knew the Germans were coming
00:52:55.40 --> 00:53:00.68 So the Belgians they they didn't have the um the Germans did not have the element of surprise there because the they
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.96 But they didn't know the manner in which the attack was coming and I think technology played a key role because
00:53:07.08 --> 00:53:10.44 I believe that might have been the first use of gliders combat ever
00:53:11.24 --> 00:53:17.24 If I remember that correctly it was certainly one of the first if not the first and so they they didn't have the expectation
00:53:17.24 --> 00:53:21.48 They they could land on top of this fortress. It was also the first use. I think of shape charges
00:53:22.20 --> 00:53:27.24 As well are that was an inventor brand new technology so they felt safe in these giant caseons of
00:53:27.72 --> 00:53:30.36 You know concrete steel and I think
00:53:31.32 --> 00:53:35.72 What an amazing victory of of just being default aggressive to the core
00:53:36.28 --> 00:53:39.24 hitting him even when they expected that the attack was coming
00:53:39.80 --> 00:53:43.56 They didn't realize the manner in which it was coming and I think they just overwhelmed them with
00:53:43.56 --> 00:53:52.44 Now they're in the fortress and we felt safe what do we do now? Yeah, and I think well the the technical I guess definition of surprise
00:53:55.24 --> 00:53:59.72 Because you know if if it in Gjitsu right you know you're going for an arm walk
00:54:00.04 --> 00:54:01.40 You know you're going for an arm walk
00:54:01.40 --> 00:54:05.16 We know you know I'm trying to tap you out right you know I'm trying to tap you out
00:54:05.16 --> 00:54:09.40 Grabbing your neck and you're you know I'm trying to grab your neck and oh my go for your on right
00:54:09.40 --> 00:54:11.72 So it's a surprise even though you know I'm trying to tap you out
00:54:11.72 --> 00:54:19.96 I'm still going to surprise you. It's like a similar thing right we know we're gonna attack but what are these weird quiet wing things coming from the sky
00:54:19.96 --> 00:54:21.96 And why are they filled with
00:54:22.20 --> 00:54:26.12 People 80 people versus 1200. It's freaking insane
00:54:29.64 --> 00:54:31.64 Lessons
00:54:31.64 --> 00:54:36.44 Sergeant Wenzel realized that it was his responsibility to complete the mission after his commanding officers
00:54:36.68 --> 00:54:38.68 Glider failed to land on the fortress
00:54:38.68 --> 00:54:40.68 How's that guy feeling afterwards?
00:54:41.80 --> 00:54:43.80 Brrr
00:54:43.80 --> 00:54:45.80 He's like so
00:54:47.64 --> 00:54:49.64 Bombed
00:54:49.64 --> 00:54:51.64 If he was still alive
00:54:51.64 --> 00:54:54.28 He worked with the existing plan to took advantage the element of surprise
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.80 That is airborne landing and given him taking charge of 80 men Sergeant Wenzel showed out sending leadership
00:54:59.80 --> 00:55:03.72 Encourage as he commanded the efforts against the fortress for three hours against great out
00:55:03.72 --> 00:55:05.32 Sergeant Wenzel's understanding of the plan
00:55:05.32 --> 00:55:09.56 All out him to shoulder the burden of responsibility of leading the assault force
00:55:10.20 --> 00:55:16.60 He clearly understood his pivotal role in the invasion of Belgium and his actions fully supported his commanders intent
00:55:17.24 --> 00:55:22.28 Sergeant Wenzel's company level raid permitted a regimental river crossing which
00:55:22.84 --> 00:55:28.12 In turn allowed the German army to rapidly pour into Belgium this eventually led to the fall fall of both
00:55:28.36 --> 00:55:31.32 Belgium and France so there you go totally pivotal moment
00:55:31.32 --> 00:55:36.36 One thing I wanted to say it I don't disagree with you very often there, but
00:55:37.40 --> 00:55:41.72 Yeah, it would from a personal perspective like man, I'm so bummed that wasn't there. It was able to lead that
00:55:42.20 --> 00:55:43.88 But actually
00:55:43.88 --> 00:55:47.32 From a leadership perspective you should be absolutely stoked oh yeah that year
00:55:47.88 --> 00:55:55.16 Your frontline leaders stup stood up made things happen got the job done even without you there and obviously that's the the real testament of
00:55:55.16 --> 00:55:59.56 Of leadership that it's about the mission. It's not about you. Yeah. Yeah, no, that's the uh
00:56:00.36 --> 00:56:05.64 On a personal level of course the guy's bummed on a professional level. He's totally stoked in you obviously on a personal level
00:56:05.64 --> 00:56:10.60 You're like freaking totally stoked that your front line troops got the job done while you were uh
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.48 You know while you were in some vineyard somewhere drinking wine
00:56:14.76 --> 00:56:20.44 I will say as as a couple times that I was acting tasked a commander in task in a bruiser
00:56:20.44 --> 00:56:25.88 Well, there was some huge operation going on a mustard charging button and the Albert in and you're out the battlefield
00:56:25.88 --> 00:56:31.88 I was like this is not fun. See that's what I'm not a person. I'm extremely bad. That's what I was doing
00:56:34.60 --> 00:56:36.60 Says here
00:56:36.60 --> 00:56:40.60 And this one of the quote. It is not the big armies that win battles. It is the good ones
00:56:42.04 --> 00:56:44.60 That's field marshal marise
00:56:45.40 --> 00:56:47.40 Disacts which
00:56:47.40 --> 00:56:51.64 Born in 1696 podcast one ten we covered his book
00:56:53.32 --> 00:56:55.88 He's got a weird background. He's all kinds of things
00:56:56.28 --> 00:57:01.96 He was like Polish and German and French and served in the Imperial Roman army, but he wrote that book
00:57:01.96 --> 00:57:07.000 I think it's my reveries on the war. It's a good book podcast one ten
00:57:07.56 --> 00:57:09.56 He's got the title field marshal though. It's pretty cool
00:57:09.56 --> 00:57:16.04 It's like remember we had a entaskin bruiser. We had it. We had a captain obvious and
00:57:17.72 --> 00:57:22.76 So he was kind of over the top with like the obvious comics and we promoted him to Admiral obvious
00:57:23.32 --> 00:57:29.48 And then it kind of went beyond that. I was like, what sounds even cooler bigger? So he became field marshal obvious
00:57:29.80 --> 00:57:36.12 There's only been I mean as far as I know at least in the in the US Navy there's been only been one field marshal of the obvious
00:57:36.12 --> 00:57:41.64 Which is a big promotion you know to big promotion. It's almost like a five star
00:57:41.88 --> 00:57:47.000 It's beyond as it's beyond us not quite a five star, but it's definitely you are definitely put out to be obvious stuff
00:57:48.20 --> 00:57:50.20 You don't want to be field marshal obvious
00:57:51.72 --> 00:57:54.76 Yeah, by that it's weird too because you think when you got
00:57:55.56 --> 00:58:01.40 When you caught you know Captain obvious right when you catch that nickname you're gonna start maybe paying attention
00:58:01.72 --> 00:58:04.04 Right put yourself in check when you get promoted
00:58:04.04 --> 00:58:08.60 What was the next promotion after when you get promoted to Admiral obviously like all right this is definitely got to stop
00:58:08.60 --> 00:58:15.64 I got to just just bite my lip a little bit more still done still don't quite pull it off guess what once you're field marshal
00:58:15.64 --> 00:58:21.000 Well, I think once you feel marshal own it right own it. Hey, I got a real couple obvious points to pour it out
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:27.000 Oh
00:58:28.44 --> 00:58:35.72 Sergeant Rubar back to back German army France 1940 in the spring of 1940 the German army invaded France as the campaign
00:58:36.12 --> 00:58:41.24 Campaign progressed the 10th Panzer Division was directed across the news river and
00:58:41.72 --> 00:58:45.88 Continue to attack toward Paris the French realized
00:58:45.88 --> 00:58:54.36 That the river provided natural obstacle that could be used to hold the advancing Germans sergeant Rubarth the leader of a squad of assault engineers
00:58:54.36 --> 00:59:01.52 Which was attached to the German 69th infantry regiment the Germans were the Germans controlled the east side of the river and the French were dug in on the west
00:59:01.52 --> 00:59:09.12 The French defenses included artillery machine gun bunkers all along the river after a violent stuka era tax sergeant Rubarth squad
00:59:09.52 --> 00:59:11.52 attacked with infantry as
00:59:11.52 --> 00:59:19.20 Rubber boat reached the far shore sergeant Rubarth squad attacked the destroyed the nearest bunker on reassembling his squad sergeant Rubarth
00:59:19.76 --> 00:59:22.40 realized only two boats had successfully crossed the river
00:59:23.44 --> 00:59:31.60 Leaving only his squad and one infantry squad on the west shore to create a breach in the French defenses. How many people were supposed to go?
00:59:33.84 --> 00:59:36.56 A sultine engineers. I wonder how many boats they actually had
00:59:36.56 --> 00:59:44.92 Only two made it. Okay undontered he ordered his unit to attack another bunker with grenades and a satchel charge
00:59:44.92 --> 00:59:50.28 The French soldiers inside surrendered and their white flag was replaced with German colors
00:59:50.72 --> 00:59:55.12 This drew cheers from the Germans on the far side of the river and
00:59:55.52 --> 01:00:01.64 Demoralize the French defenders sergeant Rubarth then advance and aggressively took two more bunkers
01:00:01.64 --> 01:00:06.64 Creating a mere 300 meter gap in the first line of French defenses
01:00:07.12 --> 01:00:12.80 More German forces then followed him across the river after receiving a fresh supply of ammunition and four more men
01:00:13.40 --> 01:00:15.40 Don't worry you got four more men
01:00:15.40 --> 01:00:18.32 Proceed sergeant Rubarth continued his attack and as
01:00:19.04 --> 01:00:27.08 Enemy artillery started raining down on them sergeant Rubarth moved his squad quickly so that the artillery fire could not adjust to them
01:00:27.08 --> 01:00:32.72 His squad overtook three more bunkers and broke them through the second line of enemy positions the second line of enemy positions
01:00:33.08 --> 01:00:37.44 After seeing several of their bunkers blown up the French forces assumed that they were being overrun
01:00:38.04 --> 01:00:40.92 Their spirit crushed the French began to withdraw
01:00:41.52 --> 01:00:46.32 The action became a route as the advancing German pursued Germans pursued the French forces
01:00:46.52 --> 01:00:52.60 First achievement sergeant Rubarth received a battlefield commission to lieutenant as awarded the nighthood of the iron cross
01:00:52.60 --> 01:00:59.32 When I think now thinking to that last one in this one
01:01:00.28 --> 01:01:04.96 Let's face it you got a small number of guys and you just start going ham
01:01:05.52 --> 01:01:10.12 Just start attacking and people aren't expecting you to do that right they don't expect
01:01:10.52 --> 01:01:16.76 They see two boat show up there like oh, whatever and then all of a sudden their bunkers getting you know shaped charge on it and you're getting jacked up
01:01:16.76 --> 01:01:22.04 Do going and moving quicker than these people that are in these static positions
01:01:23.12 --> 01:01:27.64 This is maneuver warfare right. This is like the big-any maneuver warfare. I can move and you can't
01:01:28.04 --> 01:01:34.60 Just think of that think of that and then think of it from a leadership perspective think of it when you say this is what we need to do
01:01:36.48 --> 01:01:41.86 And now you've just dug into your position you can't move anywhere and my life says hey, Jockel
01:01:41.86 --> 01:01:46.10 I know that's what you want to do, but what about you know what about this over here with these other clients and I go oh
01:01:49.70 --> 01:01:53.30 We're sticking to the plan right it just doesn't work where's I'm like hey
01:01:53.98 --> 01:01:57.66 This is where I'm out right now. What do you guys think or this is where I right now?
01:01:57.66 --> 01:02:02.62 But we might have to flex that's all you need to say that's all you need to say is hey my I have an open mind
01:02:02.62 --> 01:02:04.62 That's all you need to do is have an open mind
01:02:05.22 --> 01:02:08.18 Present your idea with a with an out right
01:02:08.18 --> 01:02:12.34 Take your position, but give yourself an out. That's all you need to do
01:02:13.38 --> 01:02:15.38 So you can maneuver a little bit
01:02:16.38 --> 01:02:19.98 I think that mentality like from a defensive perspective you know
01:02:19.98 --> 01:02:24.86 I know a clouds with it's talked about the defensive position being you know the strongest and and
01:02:25.66 --> 01:02:31.18 Your mentality is like you know you're giving the all the momentum all the initiative and I think
01:02:31.70 --> 01:02:35.38 Particularly when you're in a fortress where it's even a mail or you know this these positions
01:02:35.38 --> 01:02:39.98 They probably had no expectation that someone could be inside their fortress
01:02:39.98 --> 01:02:44.14 I would totally say if you're a bit too many good to go we have the advantage and so as soon as that happens
01:02:44.66 --> 01:02:47.22 I mean that doubt starts to creep in like man
01:02:47.74 --> 01:02:50.86 You know you're you're done. They've they've lost
01:02:51.38 --> 01:02:54.46 They've lost all morale people ready surrender people ready retreat
01:02:54.46 --> 01:03:00.66 I think that's there's something about just being on the advance that gives you I don't I think all the advantage of the world
01:03:02.02 --> 01:03:04.02 Did you
01:03:04.02 --> 01:03:07.82 When I was talking about the fact that they raised the German flag and that helped them around
01:03:07.82 --> 01:03:13.10 I had a vision of a certain American flag going up and random building so with the city of Ramadi sometimes
01:03:13.10 --> 01:03:15.60 I don't know what you're talking about boss
01:03:16.98 --> 01:03:18.98 I mean that was very helpful for Brown
01:03:18.98 --> 01:03:20.98 I can see the point firm tonight that
01:03:22.02 --> 01:03:26.58 That the American flag was running up. Well, you know you talk about hate what we're going in there and you know
01:03:26.58 --> 01:03:30.18 We get approval for these missions like you know we're gonna be a sneaky sniper overwatch
01:03:30.18 --> 01:03:32.18 We don't want the bad guys in the or we are
01:03:32.18 --> 01:03:37.78 A couple times we just just had to run the old stars and stripes up in the middle of the city and say we're right here
01:03:37.78 --> 01:03:39.78 Bring it
01:03:39.78 --> 01:03:42.78 We did get a fact day bird call me on the radio
01:03:42.78 --> 01:03:48.58 Did this good deal day good deal day call me on the radio to pass the word to us in one particular
01:03:48.58 --> 01:03:52.34 Position that hey, there were some troops massing and I was like bring you know
01:03:53.62 --> 01:03:57.86 This is that that's exactly what we're hoping for mass attack bringing on
01:03:57.86 --> 01:04:04.18 Good morale for the troops. I don't know if that could have gotten it was like plausible
01:04:04.18 --> 01:04:05.46 Deniability for
01:04:06.02 --> 01:04:09.38 Jaco is tasked a commander there. We didn't exactly run that one up for
01:04:11.46 --> 01:04:17.30 Well, I guess there was some indication because well since we're putting ourselves on report here
01:04:17.70 --> 01:04:20.10 We weren't you weren't allowed to find American flag
01:04:20.90 --> 01:04:23.38 period and we did have
01:04:23.38 --> 01:04:27.62 American flag on camark we 24 seven over time
01:04:28.18 --> 01:04:36.58 Affirmative so maybe my implied commanders intent was if you got to run up the stars and stripe
01:04:37.54 --> 01:04:40.26 Did you got to run up the stars and stripes make it tall
01:04:42.34 --> 01:04:44.34 Make it tall and have a lot of machine guys
01:04:44.34 --> 01:04:46.34 And pointing at all directions what you did
01:04:47.78 --> 01:04:49.78 check
01:04:49.78 --> 01:04:54.74 Lessons sergeant who birth clearly understood the importance of rapid crossing
01:04:56.42 --> 01:05:03.38 Of the river the commanders intent at all levels from squad a division was across the river quickly in order to maintain the momentum of attack
01:05:03.70 --> 01:05:09.62 A delay at the river would have given the French time to strengthen positions close to the Paris and possibly hold the German offensive
01:05:09.62 --> 01:05:12.34 So that's a great that's a really good simple example of
01:05:13.30 --> 01:05:15.30 Commanders intent to say hey listen
01:05:15.30 --> 01:05:24.18 The commanders intent of this operation is we have to get across this river as quickly as possible and now everybody in your division knows
01:05:24.66 --> 01:05:28.90 We're gonna get across this river. That's the goal and what I'll do whatever I got into you to make that happen
01:05:28.90 --> 01:05:32.82 That's a very nice clear example of what a commander's intent is
01:05:33.46 --> 01:05:37.94 Now everybody now everybody knows what we're trying to do and if something changes
01:05:38.74 --> 01:05:42.26 And we does something I don't expect guess what cool. I'm gonna adapt and I'm gonna get across this river
01:05:42.26 --> 01:05:44.26 I'm gonna take as many of my guys with me as I can
01:05:46.10 --> 01:05:51.06 Taking on the role as the main effort of the German attack sergeant rubarth displayed outstanding leadership
01:05:51.14 --> 01:05:56.66 Shouldering the responsibility of creating a breach in the French defenses though greatly outnumbered on the far shore
01:05:56.66 --> 01:06:01.86 The squad followed their courageous and decisive leader sergeant rubarth's bravery and judgment
01:06:01.86 --> 01:06:06.90 Allowed him to succeed despite being isolated and under attack by French artillery
01:06:06.90 --> 01:06:16.34 Sergeant rubarth did not wait for reinforcements but continued to attack the enemy deciding that rapid action was necessary
01:06:16.74 --> 01:06:20.74 This is where action versus in action right action versus in action
01:06:21.30 --> 01:06:25.38 What was I saying yesterday when we were recording you have found mine I was I was like
01:06:27.06 --> 01:06:29.06 Nine times out of ten
01:06:29.06 --> 01:06:34.02 Action is better than an action. This is an example now is there a case where perhaps it would be
01:06:34.02 --> 01:06:38.58 Better to wait for reinforcements, but I'll tell you what here's the deal if you take action
01:06:38.58 --> 01:06:41.30 You know what we got enough guys what we're gonna push we're gonna go
01:06:42.02 --> 01:06:48.42 Maybe you get stopped maybe you meet heavy resistance now you know that now you know you actually can't proceed
01:06:48.42 --> 01:06:51.30 But if you go and you're like hey actually we just we just took another bunker
01:06:52.02 --> 01:06:57.46 Let's take another one you take small steps you go forward you take action and then you learn from the feedback
01:06:57.46 --> 01:07:00.58 If the feedback would have been hey, we just tried to take another bunker and we got shellacked
01:07:00.58 --> 01:07:06.98 Okay, well, we're not gonna move anymore. We're gonna wait for reinforcements. Fine. What should your default mode be?
01:07:06.98 --> 01:07:08.98 Be aggressive make it happen
01:07:12.10 --> 01:07:16.98 His actions created an opportunity which his commanders took advantage of by pouring forces through the breach
01:07:16.98 --> 01:07:25.78 And decisively defeating enemy sergeant rubarth's actions contributed directly to his battalion's crossing his divisions attacked and the eventual defeat of France five weeks later
01:07:25.78 --> 01:07:34.02 Far better it is quote far better it is to dare mighty things to win glorious triumphs even though
01:07:34.02 --> 01:07:39.30 Checkered by failure then to rank with those poor spirits who need to enjoy much more
01:07:40.26 --> 01:07:46.42 That need to enjoy much north of the feet because they live in the gray twilight that knows not victory or defeat
01:07:47.78 --> 01:07:49.78 And that's Teddy Roosevelt
01:07:49.78 --> 01:07:54.98 Metal of honor Cuba this son metal of honor you tell beach
01:07:56.42 --> 01:08:01.38 All right next up the Marine Corps brings it we got
01:08:02.18 --> 01:08:04.18 We got sergeant John Bazelone
01:08:05.14 --> 01:08:09.38 US Marine Corps Guadalcanale 1942 August 1942
01:08:09.94 --> 01:08:14.58 The first Marine Division landed on Guadalcanale and countering stiff resistance from the Japanese defenders
01:08:14.58 --> 01:08:19.54 Sergeant John Bazelone served as a machine gun platoon sergeant supportive
01:08:20.18 --> 01:08:24.74 Company C first battalion seven parians on the night of 24 October
01:08:24.90 --> 01:08:32.26 Sergeant Bazelone's puttune occupied a key position in the battalion's offensive perimeter on a jungle ridge just past 2130
01:08:32.82 --> 01:08:42.10 The Japanese began a ferocious attack in the dark rainy night intense fighting followed and soon the machine gun unit on Bazelone's right was overrun by screaming
01:08:42.10 --> 01:08:46.26 Japanese soldiers hurling grenades and firing rifles
01:08:49.38 --> 01:08:55.78 At the same time Bazelone's machine gun started running low on ammunition Bazelone knew that the enemy
01:08:55.78 --> 01:08:59.38 That had broken through on his right were between him and the ammunition dump
01:08:59.38 --> 01:09:04.02 But he decided that if his gun teams were not re-supplied the positions would fall
01:09:04.02 --> 01:09:14.02 Sergeant Bazelone took off his heavy mud-caked boots stripped himself of all unnecessary gear and sprinted down the trail
01:09:15.54 --> 01:09:23.78 After returning with several belts of ammunition he set out for the unmanned machine gun pits to his right knowing that those heavy weapons were vital
01:09:24.10 --> 01:09:27.94 Tools in the defense of the ridge when he got back to the gun positions
01:09:27.94 --> 01:09:32.74 He found two unoccupied machine guns jammed and ran back to get one of his own
01:09:32.74 --> 01:09:37.62 He ordered a team to follow him after Bazelone's gun crew reached their destination
01:09:37.62 --> 01:09:44.98 He immediately put them into action Bazelone lay on the ground and began repairing one of the damaged weapons once the gun was repaired and loaded
01:09:45.22 --> 01:09:48.26 He got behind the gun and began engaging targets
01:09:48.74 --> 01:09:56.34 The fight raged on and Japanese bodies began to pile up in front of the machine guns at one point sergeant Bazelone had to
01:09:56.34 --> 01:10:01.78 Direct his Marines to push back the piles of bodies to maintain clear fields of fire
01:10:04.02 --> 01:10:11.38 Several more times during the night sergeant Bazelone made trips back to the command area for desperately needed ammunition
01:10:11.78 --> 01:10:13.78 Eight separate attacks were sent
01:10:14.10 --> 01:10:20.50 Against the Marines that night and Bazelone's platoon fired over 25,000 rounds
01:10:20.50 --> 01:10:28.02 They were credited with killing an estimated 300 enemy soldiers playing a major role in
01:10:28.26 --> 01:10:30.26 Fording the Japanese attack
01:10:31.54 --> 01:10:40.98 This successful defense re-established the perimeter of the first Marine Division protected the vital airfield and led to the conquest of Guadalcanal
01:10:41.54 --> 01:10:44.02 the first island taken from the Japanese
01:10:44.02 --> 01:10:53.46 For his initiative resourcefulness and leadership in defense of the ridge sergeant Bazelone was awarded the Medal of Honor
01:11:04.66 --> 01:11:06.66 Lessons
01:11:07.06 --> 01:11:12.82 Tactically sergeant Bazelone understood his role in the defense of the ridge and the intent of the company and
01:11:12.82 --> 01:11:19.30 Battalion commanders his machine gun served a pivotal role in the company and Battalion Defense line plan
01:11:19.86 --> 01:11:24.26 He took numerous actions necessary to ensure his battalions success
01:11:24.74 --> 01:11:30.58 This included making the decision to weaken one position in order to fortify and adjacent units position to his right
01:11:32.34 --> 01:11:35.54 Sergeant Bazelone exhibited great leadership during the defense
01:11:35.54 --> 01:11:41.06 He went to great lengths to provide his unit with whatever tools were necessary to maintain the defense of the ridge
01:11:41.06 --> 01:11:46.98 His courage in braving enemy fire to deliver ammunition set an example for his Marines
01:11:52.10 --> 01:11:54.10 Unbelievable
01:11:54.10 --> 01:11:56.10 It's interesting
01:11:57.30 --> 01:11:59.54 When you think about their low on ammunition
01:12:01.70 --> 01:12:02.66 And
01:12:02.66 --> 01:12:10.82 His decision is I'm going to get I'm gonna go personally get the ammunition and I can see a couple factors playing into that
01:12:10.82 --> 01:12:17.22 Decision one of them being if we don't have ammo where all gonna die so it doesn't matter
01:12:17.78 --> 01:12:19.78 You know, I could send another guy
01:12:20.34 --> 01:12:21.78 but
01:12:21.78 --> 01:12:25.38 And I could stay here to try and help you know maintain our position
01:12:26.34 --> 01:12:28.58 But without without ammunition we're all gonna die
01:12:29.30 --> 01:12:35.14 So the number one thing we need is ammunition and these guys dealing with they're doing they got this
01:12:35.14 --> 01:12:39.62 But without bullets we're we're gonna get overrun. I am going to do this
01:12:42.90 --> 01:12:44.90 That's
01:12:45.14 --> 01:12:49.54 It's an interesting thing because you know sometimes leaders got to say okay, this is what's going on
01:12:49.70 --> 01:12:53.30 Here's the absolutely critical task and I'm actually just gonna go do it right now
01:12:54.26 --> 01:12:55.94 Because if it doesn't get done we're all doomed
01:12:57.94 --> 01:12:59.94 Taking off his boots
01:13:00.98 --> 01:13:02.98 That's a that's
01:13:02.98 --> 01:13:06.74 Hard thing for me to think about because my feet are soft
01:13:10.34 --> 01:13:17.22 Man, I think every time we turned on Barcelona road, you know up there at Camp Hamilton going on ranges and and training
01:13:17.94 --> 01:13:19.94 Just think about
01:13:19.30 --> 01:13:23.54 Think about you know the exploits of John Basel. That's that's incredible
01:13:23.54 --> 01:13:27.78 And you know, I think the other thing too to think about here is these other these other
01:13:27.78 --> 01:13:30.74 Realistations were looking at I mean obviously amazing illustrations of
01:13:30.74 --> 01:13:34.50 A junior leader, you know squad leader step up a bag in these calls, but
01:13:35.30 --> 01:13:38.66 You know the previous ones in world where wanted to you were talking about you know
01:13:38.66 --> 01:13:42.50 You look vicious fighting obviously people are dying and and and being
01:13:43.30 --> 01:13:47.54 You know shot and blown up or band added or whatever but those particular charges
01:13:47.54 --> 01:13:52.34 Bonsai charges like that and and Guadalcanal like there's zero quarter is going to be given
01:13:52.34 --> 01:13:55.86 So you're overrun and like everyone's going to get killed and and I think
01:13:55.86 --> 01:14:00.42 You know, I think that was it's a different situation, you know
01:14:00.42 --> 01:14:05.70 And I think a lot more desperation that you can't just throw up your hands and surrender like the Germans did to
01:14:05.70 --> 01:14:08.42 Disarr景 your corporate York and that particular situation
01:14:08.98 --> 01:14:14.82 Yeah, I mean I almost didn't even make it past the sentence in the dark rainy night intense fighting followed and soon
01:14:14.82 --> 01:14:27.06 The machine gun unit on basloins right was overrun by screaming Japanese soldiers hurling grenades and firing rifles
01:14:26.26 --> 01:14:28.26 Just dark and
01:14:29.14 --> 01:14:31.14 When you're in dark and
01:14:31.54 --> 01:14:37.06 Especially in a jungle like that and it's dark outside and then you shoot your gun and now you've seen the muzzle flash
01:14:37.38 --> 01:14:41.22 Like you can't you can't see anything now like it's dark it's black and
01:14:41.22 --> 01:14:45.62 And so now the only thing you're hearing is screaming Japanese
01:14:46.34 --> 01:14:52.34 They're throwing grenades which again is ruining your night vision you're seeing muzzle flashes you're shooting back at muzzle flashes
01:14:54.58 --> 01:14:57.06 Freaking just horror just horror
01:15:00.50 --> 01:15:03.38 Yeah, that's some that's some unbelievable heroism there
01:15:03.38 --> 01:15:07.38 I
01:15:07.70 --> 01:15:12.26 Think you're hitting on a good point to about prior the prioritize and execute piece and I think you know
01:15:12.26 --> 01:15:16.90 We generally would say leaders don't want to be down on the details. You want to be detached, but you know to your point if you
01:15:17.54 --> 01:15:21.70 In the prior or test and ask you'd say if I don't go do this now none of it matters
01:15:21.94 --> 01:15:23.94 We have to do that and
01:15:24.18 --> 01:15:26.18 It's the existential priority
01:15:26.18 --> 01:15:30.26 Yeah, if we don't execute this priority we will not exist anymore
01:15:30.26 --> 01:15:35.78 It's an existential decision and there's only you look and he probably looked said you know
01:15:35.78 --> 01:15:38.66 I got this guy he's working that gun he can do that
01:15:38.90 --> 01:15:45.30 There's one person that could actually make this happen right now and it's me I'll be back in seven minutes with some ammo fellas
01:15:48.58 --> 01:15:50.58 Basie
01:15:53.46 --> 01:15:54.42 Next up
01:15:54.42 --> 01:16:02.26 Sergeant Jacob Pavlov Russian army
01:16:02.02 --> 01:16:05.70 42 the German six army was pushing into the Russian city of Stalingrad
01:16:06.74 --> 01:16:11.22 The Russian strategy was to draw the Germans into the city and fight them from building to building
01:16:11.54 --> 01:16:19.62 Sergeant Jacob Pavlov of the Soviet 13th guard division was called into his battalion map room in order to do recon a
01:16:19.62 --> 01:16:25.86 Forstory house in order to develop a company plan to attack the building that night Sergeant Pavlov
01:16:26.26 --> 01:16:30.10 Selected three men from his squad and set out on the reconnaissance
01:16:30.50 --> 01:16:37.70 So hey go into a recon to this building so that we can do a company sized 150 man assault on this building
01:16:39.22 --> 01:16:46.10 When the four-man team reached the objective Sergeant Pavlov realized that the house was occupied by only a few German defenders
01:16:46.10 --> 01:16:53.78 He decided to seize the house immediately with his small team he quickly devised a plan and within minutes had a tact and taking control of the house
01:16:54.66 --> 01:17:04.02 Using captured German machine guns and their own Tommy guns Sergeant Pavlov led his men in fighting back wave after wave of German counter attacks
01:17:04.10 --> 01:17:10.50 The next night Sergeant Pavlov sent a messenger back to his battalion by morning his group was reinforced with 16 men
01:17:10.50 --> 01:17:16.18 Three anti-type rifles two mortars and more machine guns his defensive preparations continued
01:17:16.18 --> 01:17:22.42 He directed the placement of a minefield around the building he ordered his men to take out the interior walls of the building to allow freedom
01:17:22.42 --> 01:17:29.22 A movement he posted sharp shooters and observers in the top of the building and fortified his command post at 200 yard trench was dug for
01:17:29.22 --> 01:17:32.58 Resupply when the German that's a lot of things to get done
01:17:32.58 --> 01:17:39.38 Digging a 200 yard trench
01:17:41.86 --> 01:17:49.38 Posting sharp-sharp-sharp-sharp and removing the walls inside the buildings you have better freedom of movement this guy was not playing when the German sent larger
01:17:50.10 --> 01:17:53.22 Armored forces against him Sergeant Pavlov in
01:17:53.38 --> 01:17:59.46 Improvised new tactics to fight them. This is beautiful due to the limited elevation of the German tanks
01:17:59.46 --> 01:18:05.94 Pavlov sent his machine gunners to the top floors and his anti-tank cruise to the basement from these positions
01:18:06.10 --> 01:18:11.70 His men put accurate suppressing fire on the German infantry while destroying the army of the armor
01:18:12.98 --> 01:18:18.82 So a tank gun can only go so far up and so far down and apparently they couldn't go far enough up
01:18:19.30 --> 01:18:24.66 To hit the roof where the machine gunners were and couldn't go far enough down to hit the anti-tank weapons
01:18:24.66 --> 01:18:31.86 Pavlov's house proved to be a key Russian position in the battle for style and grad
01:18:32.58 --> 01:18:41.46 The buildings height allowed Pavlov's observers to call accurate artillery fire in any direction and snipers chalked up hundreds of kills from the attic
01:18:47.06 --> 01:18:53.78 Upon finding his objective this is the lessons upon finding his objective lightly defended Sergeant Pavlov ignored his orders
01:18:53.78 --> 01:18:57.22 And used his initiative to take the house by surprise
01:18:58.42 --> 01:19:04.74 This key decision fully supported his commanders intent now. What's interesting about this is we dig in a little bit
01:19:06.42 --> 01:19:12.58 If I was sending you life to go and do a recon of a building that we're gonna attack tomorrow with 150 men
01:19:14.26 --> 01:19:19.14 I might not even cover the contingency we might not even cover the contingency of hey
01:19:19.14 --> 01:19:23.78 If there's no one in there just take it like because you're not expecting
01:19:25.06 --> 01:19:30.34 If you're expecting to need 150 people you're not expecting that four people so you might not even consider that
01:19:30.50 --> 01:19:36.02 Hey, and by the way if there's light resistance just take it because even light resistance with four guys
01:19:36.50 --> 01:19:38.50 Going into a defended
01:19:38.50 --> 01:19:43.62 Position it's gonna be hard all you need is one person with a machine gun at the end of a hallway and you got real problems
01:19:44.58 --> 01:19:46.58 So the fact that he just said
01:19:46.58 --> 01:19:50.26 I think we I think we got this
01:19:51.86 --> 01:19:55.46 Right and get it done and and and there's no radios
01:19:55.94 --> 01:19:59.94 There's no radios are not calling up and saying hey hey, hey, jockel the slave
01:19:59.94 --> 01:20:02.90 I took the building send reinforcements. No, you're just there
01:20:03.54 --> 01:20:11.78 We sent a messenger the next day for hours later after you hold station for 24 hours with four guys. That's that's crazy
01:20:11.78 --> 01:20:18.50 That's that's the power though of the commander's intent you know and understand the why and I think if you
01:20:20.02 --> 01:20:24.26 And certainly I mean the culture in the Soviet army that time was was pretty centralized
01:20:25.22 --> 01:20:30.02 You know as far as decisions to be made so I can't imagine that he got briefed for that contingency
01:20:30.34 --> 01:20:33.78 I think that that's highly unlikely so someone just to be like hey
01:20:34.90 --> 01:20:37.46 But thinking about what happens here though if he goes back
01:20:37.46 --> 01:20:42.58 You know it goes back and says hey, there's only you know it's the only lack resistance there
01:20:42.58 --> 01:20:46.74 We can attack now and maybe maybe by the time they plan their attack in 24 hours later
01:20:46.74 --> 01:20:52.34 It's a reinforced and there's 200 people there you know instead of a dozen or whatever was so that's
01:20:53.38 --> 01:20:57.86 That's pretty amazing initiative to say okay, what they actually what we want to do
01:20:58.18 --> 01:21:04.10 strategically is take this this key piece of terrain and I'm going to take it right now because there's the initiative
01:21:04.10 --> 01:21:09.38 Here's there's the opportunity in front of me and you know disease the initiative that's that's incredible
01:21:09.46 --> 01:21:10.74 Let's get it
01:21:10.74 --> 01:21:12.74 That's Lee Roy Jenkins just showed up
01:21:13.46 --> 01:21:15.46 Installing Rob
01:21:16.02 --> 01:21:18.02 Leeron
01:21:18.02 --> 01:21:19.22 Jank
01:21:19.22 --> 01:21:25.14 But I think about that though from a perspective leaders they they don't you think that you don't want your people to do that
01:21:25.14 --> 01:21:29.14 I don't want him to go too far. I don't want him to get to to aggressive. I don't want to you know
01:21:29.14 --> 01:21:35.22 You you wait for my orders and and so so there are plenty of leaders who would be upset with a
01:21:35.94 --> 01:21:40.90 Squan leader like Pavlov executing on something like that instead of actually saying that's awesome
01:21:40.90 --> 01:21:45.18 And if I had a bunch of path loves we're gonna we're gonna win this thing. Yeah, and that it's gonna make all the
01:21:45.18 --> 01:21:50.10 Devours I used to tell the task unit commanders and then I tell the whole task unit
01:21:50.66 --> 01:21:57.06 But I'd pull the task unit commander so I didn't say hey, you know, they'd be chaos going on and they wouldn't be getting anywhere
01:21:57.06 --> 01:22:02.90 They'd be bogged down they'd be getting shot up with paint ball those problems would be happening during training and I'd say imagine if
01:22:03.86 --> 01:22:08.18 Each one of your fire team leaders was doing something smart
01:22:08.98 --> 01:22:11.46 To move you where you wanted to go
01:22:12.58 --> 01:22:16.10 Imagine how easy things would be and they'd look at me like
01:22:16.90 --> 01:22:22.58 Dumbfounded because they'd know that's true like let's face it if a fire team leader goes hey
01:22:22.58 --> 01:22:29.30 We got a wounded guy. We need to move him and the boss just said we're moving south to the rally point if we all know we're moving south the rally point every
01:22:29.30 --> 01:22:33.90 Fire team can can start to make that happen and that was one of the things that would help
01:22:35.10 --> 01:22:38.10 Help move a task unit from
01:22:39.14 --> 01:22:43.42 centralized command to decentralized command just that little conversation which I had dozens of times
01:22:43.66 --> 01:22:49.66 Hey, what do you what do you think it would be if every one of your fire team leaders right now was doing something
01:22:49.66 --> 01:22:55.62 That you wanted them to do that was going that was moving them towards your goal
01:22:55.62 --> 01:22:59.22 How how do you think that would affect you right now? They'd be like it would be very helpful
01:22:59.22 --> 01:23:04.14 And I'd be like yes, it would be why don't you tell them all what that overall goal that's right now
01:23:04.54 --> 01:23:07.42 You're in a perimeter everyone's everyone's within 50 meters
01:23:07.58 --> 01:23:13.50 You could actually just yell it out right now where moving south the rally point out. Let's go. Okay
01:23:14.26 --> 01:23:15.62 Cool
01:23:15.62 --> 01:23:20.66 Maybe one fire team leader looks another fire team leader and says hey I got cover you bound back all right
01:23:20.66 --> 01:23:22.98 That's that's eight guys moving the right direction
01:23:23.66 --> 01:23:31.02 Some other fire team leader goes hey we're good. We got dead space. Let's move. Okay. That's another four guys move see if you just need to think that way
01:23:32.02 --> 01:23:36.94 You need your team to go out make things happen, but they can only do that if they know where they're going
01:23:38.22 --> 01:23:41.82 I watch you have the the other side of that equation as well
01:23:41.82 --> 01:23:44.18 You know, it's just something we talk about a lot of that's long for a lot
01:23:44.18 --> 01:23:46.18 And that's
01:23:46.18 --> 01:23:52.18 See the the recognition and these young leaders of the power leadership and whether it was a fire team leader or squad leader
01:23:53.18 --> 01:23:58.54 Machine gun or who wouldn't charge anybody else and they're standing out in the street and this told you know
01:23:58.54 --> 01:24:05.86 This mount down the urban urban you know training environment and there's paint balls flying around and explosions going off and total chaos
01:24:05.86 --> 01:24:10.42 And and that was it was so much like the leadership lab
01:24:10.42 --> 01:24:14.46 The US talk about was just an incredible thing to watch and when I was out there
01:24:14.46 --> 01:24:18.26 You know my my my last command as a senior leader to observe
01:24:18.26 --> 01:24:21.76 And my my team and being there with you as your your
01:24:22.34 --> 01:24:25.74 You're mentoring and training folks and walking up to some some machine gunners and hey
01:24:26.54 --> 01:24:28.54 What's going on right now?
01:24:28.54 --> 01:24:30.94 I don't know what's going on so what does it make a cause?
01:24:32.38 --> 01:24:36.26 What do you what do you think you do right now? We should get that building over there
01:24:36.26 --> 01:24:43.18 Why don't you make it happen? I remember I'd get the bl- this is the blank stare of like wait a second
01:24:44.18 --> 01:24:48.52 You're telling me that I could get people to go over there and they look at me kind of tilt the head
01:24:49.54 --> 01:24:55.22 And say I'm gonna get trouble if I do that I can't do that actually no one is doing anything right now
01:24:55.22 --> 01:24:57.52 I just walked by your
01:24:57.52 --> 01:25:03.74 Platoon commander and he was sitting there talking to your task unit commander about spigetti for dinner because
01:25:03.74 --> 01:25:08.30 They have no idea what's happening and if you don't make something happen no one's gonna be
01:25:08.30 --> 01:25:10.74 Anything tonight could do this over and over again
01:25:11.34 --> 01:25:14.86 Well, but you would ask the question like hey, do you think your task?
01:25:14.86 --> 01:25:19.54 Get a commander want you to be sitting out the street getting shot right now? Then they have to of course not of course
01:25:19.54 --> 01:25:23.18 They don't want their tide up with some other problem. What or their spaghetti dinner whatever it is
01:25:24.38 --> 01:25:30.26 But once you once they recognize the power of leadership and you encourage them to make that call and then I hate fall back in the building no
01:25:30.26 --> 01:25:35.48 And now all of a sudden you got you got leaders at every level that are stepping up a bacon thing's happened
01:25:35.80 --> 01:25:42.22 So so you having both of those conversations with the leaders both ends to encourage encourage their their junior folks
01:25:42.22 --> 01:25:49.48 A step up a may calls and then with the junior frontline troops that are executing and then you actually have decentralized commands
01:25:49.48 --> 01:25:51.48 It's out there making things happen
01:25:51.48 --> 01:25:54.48 It's a powerful powerful tool
01:25:54.48 --> 01:26:01.64 These centralized command sergeant back to the book sergeant path-loff showed exceptional leadership skills while defending the house
01:26:01.64 --> 01:26:04.84 He organized and led an effective defense position for over six weeks
01:26:07.52 --> 01:26:12.20 He showed tackling improvisation and skill as a combined arms leader
01:26:13.20 --> 01:26:19.84 The sergeant path-loff's actions show how one leaders actually contribute to an overall battle hits puttune sized defensive strong point
01:26:19.84 --> 01:26:24.68 Became the key position for his battalion, which in turn became the main effort of the division
01:26:26.88 --> 01:26:34.48 Pretty awesome it's better to be it's better to be on hand with ten men than to be absent with ten thousand
01:26:35.68 --> 01:26:38.96 That's from a hammer lane a Mongol emperor
01:26:40.88 --> 01:26:42.88 That would
01:26:43.44 --> 01:26:46.64 That would be a gangess con or jengess con
01:26:46.64 --> 01:26:50.96 What that Mongol emperor?
01:26:52.88 --> 01:26:56.16 No, it's not him. Is it not him?
01:26:57.28 --> 01:26:59.28 It's not him
01:26:59.28 --> 01:27:01.76 I don't even actually know if those two were related
01:27:02.64 --> 01:27:10.04 But same area of the earth. That's for damn sure and apparently I apparently both of them like kicking ass
01:27:11.16 --> 01:27:13.16 What was what was gangess con?
01:27:13.16 --> 01:27:17.16 I can't think of it. I thought it was not it. It's
01:27:18.68 --> 01:27:23.84 I got to go back and review the book I read a few or see that's you write it does begin with like a t-up's a t and they make
01:27:23.84 --> 01:27:27.56 So they made some kind of a movie about it echo. There maybe you could help out here. There's a movie about it
01:27:28.16 --> 01:27:33.44 See that's a week from neither one of us to be alive. I got a research that for sure more discipline go
01:27:35.36 --> 01:27:37.84 But I know that that's not him. All right
01:27:37.84 --> 01:27:44.64 Sergeant Forten British Army France 1944
01:27:46.48 --> 01:27:51.80 Vital to the success. I like I said that life just pounded some Zachary. I need to remember that name
01:27:52.32 --> 01:27:54.32 Let's bring the clarity
01:27:54.32 --> 01:28:01.20 Vital the success of the 1944 Allied invasion of Europe was the capture of valuable bridges inland of the beaches
01:28:01.36 --> 01:28:07.52 This was to be done by parachute forces the night before. D day if these bridges were not taken the German army would be able to counter attack
01:28:07.52 --> 01:28:13.04 The landing forces and push the Allies into the sea just after midnight in the early morning hours of six June
01:28:13.04 --> 01:28:20.40 The fifth parachute brigade of this British six airborne division landed in Normandy one glider company was tasked with the vital mission of
01:28:20.52 --> 01:28:25.32 Seizing and holding the Pegasus bridge which crossed the
01:28:25.68 --> 01:28:27.68 Kain canal
01:28:27.68 --> 01:28:37.44 And secure the east flank of the British landing beaches if this bridge was not secured the Germans would be able to launch a flank attack into the
01:28:37.44 --> 01:28:41.52 Exposed left wing of the British invasion forces after
01:28:41.52 --> 01:28:47.68 Seizing the bridge in a daring assault the company established a defensive perimeter facing east towards an intersection at
01:28:47.68 --> 01:28:51.96 0132 tanks of the first Panzer-Dorant engineer company with infantry support
01:28:51.96 --> 01:29:01.12 Crept toward the bridge as the lead element of a German counter attack the only this is a good story the only anti-tank weapon available to the platoon
01:29:01.68 --> 01:29:05.12 covering the approach was a small piot rocket
01:29:05.64 --> 01:29:07.64 Manned by Sergeant Thorden
01:29:09.32 --> 01:29:13.04 The pair troopers were fearful that a tank attack could not be stopped
01:29:13.56 --> 01:29:21.72 Sergeant Thornton laid lay hidden in a pile of equipment knowing the limited range of a the piot and the vulnerability of his platoon
01:29:21.72 --> 01:29:26.80 Sposition he decided to wait until the tanks were a mere 50 yards away before firing
01:29:28.20 --> 01:29:33.08 Fortuned fired the piot gun and scored a direct hit on the lead tank
01:29:34.04 --> 01:29:37.32 The round penetrated and caused a magnificent explosion
01:29:37.92 --> 01:29:46.28 Shells inside the tank began to cook off creating a fantastic light show the German company commander was mortally wounded as he tried to flee the burning Hulk
01:29:46.28 --> 01:29:53.76 The display and numerous explosions acted as a beacon for other paratroop forces lost in the dark
01:29:53.76 --> 01:30:02.44 They converged on Pegasus bridge believing that British forces had come under severe attack the second German tank immediately reversed course
01:30:02.84 --> 01:30:10.000 The lieutenant in the tank reported that the British had occupied the bridge in force and were equipped with six pound anti-tank guns
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:18.12 The German commanders decided to wait until daylight before launching another attack as morning approach the allied force were able to land on the Normandy beaches and protect
01:30:18.12 --> 01:30:20.64 From a strong German counter attack the German delay
01:30:20.64 --> 01:30:30.36 Allowed the allies to build up combat power on the beaches and rapidly strike inland the invasion of France and the driver cross Europe led to the defeat of Germany in less than a years time
01:30:33.36 --> 01:30:37.40 So some lessons here sergeant Thornton knew that his piot gun was the only defense
01:30:37.40 --> 01:30:44.32 The paratroopers had against the German army he decided to hold his fire until the lead tank was danger close lowering the Germans into a trap
01:30:45.32 --> 01:30:51.20 This alleged yet that is that is bad. That's right there. You gotta think what's going to that guy's fire
01:30:51.20 --> 01:30:56.40 I mean just being in close proximity tanks in Iraq 50 yards away
01:30:56.96 --> 01:31:03.24 It just that noise and knowing the power of that thing and you know his guys are like dude
01:31:03.24 --> 01:31:07.20 What is it? What's he waiting for? Yeah, and you got that thought
01:31:07.20 --> 01:31:12.40 Going through your head of like the catty shack like noon and like the mess. Yeah, you got one shot
01:31:13.60 --> 01:31:16.92 To quote the great echo Charles. Oh, you could say is
01:31:17.20 --> 01:31:19.52 Dang yeah, that's a tough one wins
01:31:19.92 --> 01:31:22.96 When sergeant Thornton's round hit the tank it's at off a chain of events
01:31:22.96 --> 01:31:27.72 Which helped ensure the success of the D-Day invasion the British were able to reinforce and reconciled it in the dark
01:31:27.72 --> 01:31:33.04 The Germans decided not to risk a night attack against strong unknown forces the burning tank itself
01:31:33.04 --> 01:31:41.64 Presbyter the Germans from approaching the bridge when the British when the bridge with the bridge and British hands the pair troop company held it an entire pans arrangement at bay
01:31:42.92 --> 01:31:44.92 damn
01:31:44.92 --> 01:31:51.56 If that pans arrangement had been able to penetrate into Normandy into the Normandy beach at the ally invasion might have failed
01:31:52.32 --> 01:31:54.32 The company's pivotal position
01:31:54.32 --> 01:31:58.96 Support of the airborne divisions mission and allow the British landing forces to free
01:31:58.96 --> 01:32:08.96 Access to the beaches one shot potentially shaved the left flank of the ally invasion one shot saved the left flank of the ally invasion
01:32:08.96 --> 01:32:11.96 And there's a comment here a
01:32:14.24 --> 01:32:20.72 Tachyl success is only really decisive if it is gained at the strategically correct spot
01:32:20.72 --> 01:32:28.10 That's a volent mocha which we haven't done him yet moving gun him in the books. All right, so while I was reading that
01:32:30.44 --> 01:32:32.44 Phone of something so
01:32:34.44 --> 01:32:37.24 I was talking about the fact earlier that
01:32:38.32 --> 01:32:41.52 When we got to modern warfare when we got machine guns
01:32:42.08 --> 01:32:46.76 We started to decentralize command because now life squad is
01:32:46.76 --> 01:32:52.16 Hundred yards away from me so that way we have some dispersions that we all way we all don't get killed at the same time
01:32:52.16 --> 01:32:55.76 So that way I just got to say hey like life years are objective you got to go make it happen
01:32:55.76 --> 01:33:01.72 So now when you're talking about going in right like you're going into gliders and it's in in band of brothers
01:33:02.84 --> 01:33:06.12 When you're watching the gliders come in you're going in the dark you're hitting
01:33:06.68 --> 01:33:09.24 You're just you're just gonna be alone when you hit the ground
01:33:09.56 --> 01:33:13.52 That's what's gonna happen. You're gonna be with what you're gonna be with whatever 22 other guys
01:33:13.52 --> 01:33:19.60 That's what you're gonna be you who knows where your commander is gonna be you're freaking flying in the dark where you're jumping out of an airplane
01:33:20.24 --> 01:33:23.52 How what's your grouping how many people you're gonna be close to
01:33:25.28 --> 01:33:27.28 so
01:33:27.28 --> 01:33:31.12 That not everyone I mean they have almost no communications
01:33:31.52 --> 01:33:40.44 So what we have to do is we have to make sure that everyone understands the commanders intent everyone has to have some kind of objective
01:33:40.44 --> 01:33:48.96 So the more we got to this modern warfare the more decentralized command was and the more
01:33:49.60 --> 01:33:51.60 importance there was on
01:33:52.32 --> 01:33:54.32 commanders intent
01:33:54.32 --> 01:33:57.96 Then what happens then we start getting radios
01:33:59.56 --> 01:34:01.56 Right, so now all of a sudden
01:34:01.80 --> 01:34:04.80 Hey, life you go there I'll call you I
01:34:04.80 --> 01:34:12.12 Let you know what to do when we get there or if you get in the trouble or if it's not what you expected give me a make-coms
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000 So now I'm a son I'm allowed to de- or I'm not allowed
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000 I naturally
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:27.76 Ease towards taking the stress off of the commanders intent because I figure just give me a call when you hit the ground if it's not what we expected
01:34:29.04 --> 01:34:33.60 So when you think about if you're gonna freaking launch gliders and paratroopers
01:34:33.60 --> 01:34:39.92 Into France for D-Day you got to expect they're gonna hit the ground. They're gonna have no idea where they are what to do
01:34:40.64 --> 01:34:45.48 They're gonna have no communications with you. They better they let me rephrase that they're gonna have
01:34:45.92 --> 01:34:47.92 No communications with you and they hit the ground
01:34:48.48 --> 01:34:55.000 They are probably not even gonna have communications with more than five or six people when they initially hit the ground maybe 10
01:34:55.68 --> 01:34:57.68 You know maybe if it's in a glider they're all together
01:34:58.76 --> 01:35:00.76 But they're gonna be isolated
01:35:00.76 --> 01:35:05.60 So they have to understand the commanders intent otherwise it just stops right there
01:35:06.04 --> 01:35:08.04 But as soon as we get radio communications
01:35:09.08 --> 01:35:11.48 Now it's like okay, well, you know when you hit the ground
01:35:12.16 --> 01:35:18.96 Check in for the objectives or wait you know if you if you're not sure where you are give us a call and will so all of a sudden
01:35:19.12 --> 01:35:22.72 Commander's intent becomes less important and then you get to
01:35:24.20 --> 01:35:28.48 Less important if you if you could make radio come less important if you can make radio cons
01:35:28.48 --> 01:35:30.72 So then you get you fast forward, you know
01:35:31.60 --> 01:35:33.84 To Vietnam where maybe now every
01:35:33.84 --> 01:35:35.84 Platoon has a radio
01:35:36.48 --> 01:35:38.64 Right every Platoon has a radio
01:35:39.12 --> 01:35:43.60 So now well wait we at least can can control that then you can fast forward to the
01:35:44.20 --> 01:35:49.84 To the 90s like even when I first got in the teams we might not have a radio for each guy
01:35:50.64 --> 01:35:53.44 In the Platoon there might be like four guys don't get a radio
01:35:53.44 --> 01:35:59.56 Hey, make sure you stick with whatever you know because you're doing like a ship boarding and like hey if you don't got a radio
01:35:59.56 --> 01:36:01.08 Make sure you stick with somebody that does
01:36:01.76 --> 01:36:04.48 But now pretty much we don't need even know anything
01:36:04.92 --> 01:36:06.92 By the time we get to the teams in the
01:36:07.96 --> 01:36:10.20 2000 we've all got radios
01:36:10.88 --> 01:36:12.88 all got radios so
01:36:13.96 --> 01:36:18.24 So now I can control more. Life tell me what's going to give me a status update
01:36:18.24 --> 01:36:22.64 So I can tell you what to do next and then you go
01:36:22.64 --> 01:36:26.60 To the 2010s I always said I got a blue force tracker
01:36:26.60 --> 01:36:31.80 I got a video of what we're doing and you can see where now we're becoming we're going away from
01:36:32.48 --> 01:36:35.000 decentralized command and moving closer and closer to
01:36:35.56 --> 01:36:42.28 More micro management because the technology allows me as the leader to
01:36:43.44 --> 01:36:46.32 Move those chess pieces as I see fit and
01:36:47.76 --> 01:36:51.44 It feels comfortable it feels more comfortable to do that of course. We know it's wrong
01:36:51.44 --> 01:36:56.56 Because for me to be like life give me a status up right date so I can give you you know your next move
01:36:56.56 --> 01:37:01.84 Oh, well my status it up the only eye jocco. We're getting flanked right now. What do you want me to do?
01:37:02.64 --> 01:37:05.36 Oh, I want you to oh, life just got shot
01:37:05.92 --> 01:37:11.92 Why because he didn't react quickly enough because he's sitting there waiting to be told what to do so what we're seeing now is a
01:37:12.64 --> 01:37:14.64 tendency to move
01:37:15.04 --> 01:37:20.48 More towards centralized command because we have the technology to facilitate
01:37:20.48 --> 01:37:25.24 Centralized command. I'm not saying it's right. I'm saying it's bad
01:37:25.60 --> 01:37:28.48 It's wrong, but it's that's the reason that it's happening
01:37:28.64 --> 01:37:35.16 We're starting to see more and more micro management because we have the technology of silte it's it as you're saying that I'm thinking about
01:37:35.68 --> 01:37:38.56 You know, I'm thinking about as with the training that you ran
01:37:39.04 --> 01:37:41.08 Was you know, which was the best
01:37:41.32 --> 01:37:45.84 Freaking training in the world when you were the officer charge of trained attachment
01:37:45.84 --> 01:37:47.84 You know here for the west-go seal teams and
01:37:47.84 --> 01:37:54.56 You know your instructors were were out there to teach to teach people how hard it was going to be
01:37:54.56 --> 01:37:59.20 Particularly in the urban environment, you know in a combat situation how easily you can get in blue on blue situation
01:37:59.20 --> 01:38:03.40 How easily things to go chaotic how easily you can't actually make comes on the radio
01:38:04.40 --> 01:38:09.52 You know or the lambo or firm environment exactly same thing and distances at ridge lines in the way or whatever
01:38:09.52 --> 01:38:12.80 Maybe and because it seems that way in theory
01:38:12.96 --> 01:38:15.76 You know, it seems that all in theory. We just talked everybody in the radio
01:38:15.76 --> 01:38:20.72 To be a call just radio we'll do your will decomplete. Oh, okay, and then when you realize like hey
01:38:21.52 --> 01:38:24.92 That's not gonna work if we can't make comes in you talk about shipboarding
01:38:24.92 --> 01:38:29.32 That's a great example like hey, I'm down on the engine room and there's a whole bunch of seal between me and you up in the bridge
01:38:29.32 --> 01:38:33.16 I got no comes with you whatsoever and if we're thinking that like hey
01:38:33.16 --> 01:38:36.92 I just made a call on the radio and everyone heard me and I tried to do them
01:38:36.92 --> 01:38:40.24 You taught me that and it one of the one of the biggest lessons for me
01:38:40.24 --> 01:38:47.16 You know, as we've talked about here and you know podcast you know years back is is trying to put out
01:38:47.16 --> 01:38:52.48 You know a message over the radio hey everyone do this do that and you were like use verbal commands and
01:38:52.72 --> 01:38:56.28 That was one of those things like not everyone is hearing me on the radio
01:38:56.28 --> 01:39:00.60 They're in the middle of doing stuff. There's people that are on the third story and they're talking to a bunch of walls
01:39:00.60 --> 01:39:03.12 And they're not they may not even be hearing your transmission
01:39:03.20 --> 01:39:05.68 So this illusion that I'm communicating
01:39:05.84 --> 01:39:09.72 You know is it's a total illusion because it's it's not the reality
01:39:09.72 --> 01:39:15.32 And if people don't have commanders that tend to they can't execute and there's no substitute for that at all
01:39:15.32 --> 01:39:21.000 And we see that now right in the business world as leader sent out an email or you know
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.88 Hey, I told everybody what to do that they should just read their email
01:39:23.88 --> 01:39:29.88 Like hey, you're guys in the field on their email 247 there they're in the middle of doing stuff by the way they got 14 emails
01:39:31.48 --> 01:39:35.36 At six o'clock in the morning and you think that they're gonna take that one
01:39:35.36 --> 01:39:41.56 From you and be like oh, especially especially if you're the kind of leader that sends out hey just checking in with everyone
01:39:41.56 --> 01:39:45.88 Let no one knows what's going on like no no don't sign me checking emails
01:39:46.64 --> 01:39:49.92 You're gonna email I'm emailing you there's a reason for it
01:39:49.92 --> 01:39:53.20 You need to open it up and read it that means I'm not gonna email you 12 times a day
01:39:53.20 --> 01:39:57.84 I'm not even gonna email you three times a day when you get an email from me it's important
01:39:59.16 --> 01:40:04.92 If you set the presence that I'm gonna send you a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter guess what same thing with with coming up on the radio
01:40:04.92 --> 01:40:10.40 Hey, I actually need a hey anyone's got another on a home view we can push back in this reality
01:40:10.40 --> 01:40:14.42 I can't read it two more guys are just talking on the radio talking on the radio talking on the radio
01:40:15.16 --> 01:40:17.16 Eventually no one's listening to you anymore
01:40:17.64 --> 01:40:24.28 We work with the company recently where they're running a plant and the plant is being managed from a couple hundred miles away
01:40:24.28 --> 01:40:28.52 We're in like a command center and they lost power
01:40:28.52 --> 01:40:35.60 So they lose power and all of a sudden like hey they got no comms at all everything has to be done on site
01:40:35.60 --> 01:40:39.22 You know, and if you don't understand commensate the tent if you don't understand what those procedures are
01:40:39.22 --> 01:40:43.78 I mean you've got to have those contingency plans in place and I think that was what was so awesome about
01:40:44.60 --> 01:40:46.44 About seeing that at you know
01:40:46.44 --> 01:40:50.12 A trade at when you're running things is you're instilling those lessons of like okay
01:40:50.12 --> 01:40:54.68 This is why I've got to make sure that my junior leaders my squat leaders
01:40:54.68 --> 01:40:56.68 You know can step up and make calls
01:40:56.68 --> 01:41:02.44 Because if regardless of the technology that we have we're gonna fail if they can't
01:41:02.44 --> 01:41:06.04 Yeah, there would always be the the troop coming through and they'd say well
01:41:06.04 --> 01:41:07.64 I'd say well, how are you coordinate that?
01:41:07.64 --> 01:41:09.96 It would look oh it's gonna get on the radio and when it's go time
01:41:09.96 --> 01:41:15.60 I'd be like what if you don't get comms and they would kind of look at me puzzled and it get if you if you make your plan
01:41:16.20 --> 01:41:21.72 This is the this should be the fifth law of combat the fifth law of combat is if you make your plan and
01:41:21.80 --> 01:41:25.88 It's based on making community radio communications with some other element and
01:41:25.88 --> 01:41:28.68 Your plan relies on that it will not work
01:41:29.32 --> 01:41:35.84 It will not work it is going to fail you've got to have you know secondary tertiary forms of communication that
01:41:36.24 --> 01:41:41.74 Overcome the radio as you're saying that I'm thinking about the image of you standing on top of a humby at
01:41:42.68 --> 01:41:44.68 entry control point three
01:41:44.68 --> 01:41:49.92 On the far side of the canal when we had all this danger of snipers around there and and
01:41:50.16 --> 01:41:54.84 We knew that this was there was sniper activity and like no one actually picked their head above the big
01:41:54.84 --> 01:42:00.32 Haskell barriers jockels standing on top of the humbys with this tape and tenah, you know extended
01:42:00.32 --> 01:42:03.36 Delight six rate feed above is said to make comms with me
01:42:03.80 --> 01:42:11.32 You know as I was we were forward in in an overwatch position and and even then it was it was it was the recognition of like hey we
01:42:11.72 --> 01:42:14.28 We're it's gonna be really hard to talk on the radio
01:42:15.72 --> 01:42:21.22 You know and and you you did you put yourself at risk to do that, but if I didn't have commenders attend
01:42:21.22 --> 01:42:27.32 I mean I there's no way I could I could rely on that to have you make the calls for me, you know from a distant position
01:42:30.54 --> 01:42:32.54 I wanted to say one thing about this and
01:42:33.10 --> 01:42:39.52 You talked about you know the power of the flag and we talked about in that previous you know the Germans at run up the flag and French were demoralized
01:42:40.26 --> 01:42:43.02 nothing more demoralizing than a
01:42:43.66 --> 01:42:45.66 giant burning tank hole
01:42:45.66 --> 01:42:51.14 You know the the hole could that tank just just burning there that all the other skin see and
01:42:52.58 --> 01:42:58.98 That that was obviously incredibly demoralizing in this particular situation and I think when you
01:42:59.82 --> 01:43:04.34 Oh, I see what you're saying you're talking about this particular word where he hit this tank with the
01:43:04.34 --> 01:43:09.90 With the beyond yeah, he had the tank with the rocket all of a sudden, you know the tank explosion to big fireball and
01:43:10.46 --> 01:43:13.86 clearly that was a massively demoralizing thing for
01:43:13.86 --> 01:43:20.34 The German forces there which which turned it around for the breads, but I think yeah running up flags is great
01:43:22.14 --> 01:43:24.82 blowing up tanks and having a burning
01:43:25.98 --> 01:43:30.90 vehicle and for all to see like oh, I don't want that happen to me. Yeah, the reason it took me a second there
01:43:30.90 --> 01:43:32.66 It's because the times that
01:43:33.06 --> 01:43:39.22 American tanks got blown up in Ramadhi and it would take you know 24 hours to get a 88 down there to a
01:43:39.22 --> 01:43:46.78 Braggum out and that was freaking demoralizing to you know and that we we talked about the vehicle graveyard
01:43:46.78 --> 01:43:50.94 But just knowing that they're gonna get some the enemy's gonna get there
01:43:50.94 --> 01:43:56.62 And it's freaking horrible. It was incredibly demoralized to try to drive down you know route Michigan
01:43:56.62 --> 01:43:59.06 It's seen some burned out a whole come of vehicle in the side of the road
01:43:59.86 --> 01:44:04.86 But the good news was on our side. It was also very demoralizing, you know when the bad guys could observe
01:44:04.86 --> 01:44:09.94 Their their buddies land out in the street after some seals nipers put him in the dirt
01:44:09.94 --> 01:44:13.42 Yeah, and that was pretty demoralizing as well for them
01:44:13.82 --> 01:44:15.82 Which we took some pride in
01:44:15.82 --> 01:44:17.82 Chuck
01:44:22.10 --> 01:44:25.02 Next Sergeant Stephen Greg
01:44:25.50 --> 01:44:26.94 US Army Italy
01:44:26.94 --> 01:44:38.06 1944 and August of 1944 the Allied offensive in Italy was stalemated and amphibious landing at Anzeo was executed in an attempt to outflank the German defenses and capture Rome
01:44:38.06 --> 01:44:43.74 The landing units became stalled on the beach head allow allowing the Germans to reinforce their defenses
01:44:44.14 --> 01:44:47.10 The day after the landing L company of the
01:44:47.34 --> 01:44:54.74 143rd Infantry was moving north towards Rome the Germans were waiting in ambush and the company was quickly pinned down by enemy fire
01:44:54.74 --> 01:45:04.94 Realizing that the fire was too heavy for the medics to tend to the wounded Sergeant Greg a mortar man picked up a 30 caliber light machine gun and advanced on the enemy position
01:45:13.22 --> 01:45:14.90 His
01:45:14.90 --> 01:45:20.30 Measure to accurate bursts suppress the enemy long enough for the casualties to be evacuated
01:45:20.30 --> 01:45:23.98 Unfortunately Sergeant Greg ran out of the ammunition knows captured
01:45:25.66 --> 01:45:31.14 While Sergeant Greg's captors took cover from incoming art American artillery
01:45:31.46 --> 01:45:35.62 Sergeant Greg grabbed the machine pistol and fought his way back to friendly lines
01:45:39.94 --> 01:45:44.58 I sometimes I'm pause because I'm thinking about these things in a little bit deeper level like
01:45:44.58 --> 01:45:50.82 Picking up a 30 caliber light machine gun, which it says light machine gun a 30 caliber machine that is not light and
01:45:51.70 --> 01:45:53.70 Just advancing on the enemy position
01:45:55.10 --> 01:46:00.66 That's just awesome and then you picture this guy we start getting hit with
01:46:01.50 --> 01:46:07.34 artillery and all the captors hide and he's like oh check
01:46:08.34 --> 01:46:10.34 You little babies
01:46:10.34 --> 01:46:13.94 Watch this grabs a machine pistol fights way back from lines
01:46:13.94 --> 01:46:17.38 The next day the Germans counter attacked L company
01:46:18.18 --> 01:46:26.66 Sorry the next day the Germans counter attacked L company was ordered to hold the line on a hill capture the day before acting as a forward observer
01:46:27.94 --> 01:46:33.22 Sergeant Greg directed over 600 rounds onto the enemy until he lost communications with the mortar section
01:46:33.22 --> 01:46:35.86 Knowing how important the mortar fire was to the defense
01:46:36.10 --> 01:46:40.94 Sergeant Greg took the initiative to find out what had happened to the phone line upon nearing the mortar section
01:46:40.94 --> 01:46:45.74 Another soldier yelled at the Germans had seized the mortar position and were dropping rounds on the Americans
01:46:46.62 --> 01:46:49.82 Sergeant Greg assaulted the Germans taking two prisoners
01:46:50.38 --> 01:46:56.90 He quickly put the mortars back into the fight by gathering up a handful of American troops and teaching them how to fire mortars
01:46:59.42 --> 01:47:01.42 OJT
01:47:01.42 --> 01:47:03.42 L company held the line
01:47:03.42 --> 01:47:08.78 Sergeant Greg's bravery initiative in situational awareness contributed to his units successful defense
01:47:08.78 --> 01:47:14.86 The defeat of the German counter attack led to the allied breakout from the beach head and the eventual capture of Rome
01:47:15.98 --> 01:47:21.02 That's just a solo a lot right there. That's crazy. This solo operation
01:47:21.02 --> 01:47:25.02 Have any good check. Check out. We'll go find out what's going on with this phone wire away to second
01:47:25.26 --> 01:47:29.98 There's some Germans with our mortars cool. I'm good. What do I do? Oh, I attack them
01:47:29.98 --> 01:47:33.42 They give me a 30 30 calvarshan gun. Let's get to
01:47:33.42 --> 01:47:44.22 Yeah, Sergeant Greg displayed keen safe digital lessons sergeant Greg displayed keen situation awareness during combat at anTO while acting as a ford observer
01:47:44.38 --> 01:47:49.74 Sergeant Greg realized the importance of his units role in the company defense and did everything in his power to keep the mortars firing
01:47:49.74 --> 01:47:50.94 So
01:47:50.94 --> 01:47:55.98 This says he realized the important role like he realized what's going on. There was no one told him we better get those mortars up
01:47:55.98 --> 01:48:01.90 He realized it and made something happen when ambushed Sergeant Greg displayed the bravery and decisiveness to take action
01:48:01.90 --> 01:48:07.02 His individual attack on the Germans lifted the pressure on his unit and allowed the wounded to be evacuated
01:48:07.18 --> 01:48:11.58 Sergeant Greg's leadership abilities and strength of character allowed him to take a handful of Americans
01:48:11.66 --> 01:48:15.10 Not under his command and train them while under enemy fire
01:48:16.54 --> 01:48:20.94 Sergeant Greg's improvised section maintain the supporting fires which were so critical to the companies
01:48:21.82 --> 01:48:23.82 Defense
01:48:28.14 --> 01:48:29.66 Action
01:48:29.66 --> 01:48:36.22 Is this the common theme action if they talk about initiative that's good they talk about understanding the commanders intent but
01:48:37.66 --> 01:48:39.66 actually taking action
01:48:39.66 --> 01:48:41.18 is
01:48:41.18 --> 01:48:43.18 What we need to do
01:48:44.22 --> 01:48:47.66 In the book called extreme ownership
01:48:48.70 --> 01:48:53.74 When we talked about prioritize and execute one of the things that that I had told stoner
01:48:53.74 --> 01:49:00.46 Was you know wrote it on this thing relax look around and make a call and what's interesting about that is when I wrote that
01:49:00.70 --> 01:49:02.70 There's a part missing
01:49:02.70 --> 01:49:04.70 There's a part missing to that
01:49:05.02 --> 01:49:07.02 So when you get into a
01:49:07.26 --> 01:49:11.42 Situation where there's a lot of mayhem going on what you need to do is relax you know take a breath
01:49:12.14 --> 01:49:16.94 Look around actually observe what's happening and then make a call right make a call
01:49:18.30 --> 01:49:20.94 Now there's a part that's when you line that up with the Udalupe
01:49:20.94 --> 01:49:23.50 It almost lines up perfectly
01:49:25.02 --> 01:49:26.38 Because
01:49:26.38 --> 01:49:33.50 Observe or you decide and act we got relax which is like all right look around which is definitely observed
01:49:34.86 --> 01:49:37.34 And then make a call is decide
01:49:38.86 --> 01:49:41.58 The thing that I didn't say to Seth
01:49:43.02 --> 01:49:44.38 Was
01:49:44.38 --> 01:49:47.50 Was act and I would have said execute I would have used the word execute
01:49:47.50 --> 01:49:53.10 I didn't put that on the windshield for him the reason that I didn't put that on the windshield for him
01:49:54.22 --> 01:49:56.22 is because
01:49:58.54 --> 01:50:01.82 When you tell a seal platoon to do something
01:50:02.78 --> 01:50:05.66 Nine times out of ten it's gonna get executed when someone says
01:50:06.86 --> 01:50:11.58 Online get the word gets past they get online when someone says peel right they get all mine
01:50:11.58 --> 01:50:15.66 They peel right when someone says strong right strong left when somebody makes a call it gets executed
01:50:15.66 --> 01:50:18.62 And his platoon was executing stuff
01:50:19.34 --> 01:50:21.98 He was him that needed to make a call so
01:50:23.34 --> 01:50:30.38 That's that's the piece that I didn't tell Seth because I didn't need to because it wasn't him that was gonna use gonna make the call
01:50:30.54 --> 01:50:36.78 His platoon was gonna execute and and believe me they did you know when when he would make a call or when someone would make a call
01:50:36.78 --> 01:50:43.02 They'd execute that's pretty normal. It's very normal for a seal platoon. It's very seldom that a seal platoon when they get
01:50:43.02 --> 01:50:48.62 Do when they get told the excuse something that they don't do it if you make a call jp to nls executed
01:50:48.62 --> 01:50:53.74 People are yeah, you picture you got 16 jp to nls or even if you got five jp to nls and some other guys
01:50:53.74 --> 01:50:56.38 Shit's gonna happen. It's gonna happen
01:50:57.02 --> 01:51:04.78 So when I wrote that for Seth it was about him and the execute part I didn't have to say anything because I knew if he made a call it was gonna happen
01:51:06.94 --> 01:51:09.58 That's a that's a big assumption
01:51:09.58 --> 01:51:16.94 For a lot of for it's a big assumption for us as individuals and it's a big assumption in a normal team right
01:51:17.26 --> 01:51:18.86 Look, I knew
01:51:18.86 --> 01:51:25.10 Delta platoon at that time and like I said most seal platoons quite frankly they will execute as we just said
01:51:25.18 --> 01:51:27.18 But that's not always commented and
01:51:28.06 --> 01:51:30.06 It's something that
01:51:30.06 --> 01:51:35.14 You should we should actually add if you're gonna say hey if when there's things happening relax look around and make a call
01:51:35.58 --> 01:51:37.58 The next thing should be execute
01:51:37.58 --> 01:51:41.02 Because there's people that make calls there's people that make calls and businesses
01:51:41.02 --> 01:51:44.38 There's people that make calls and dynamic situations they make a call
01:51:44.78 --> 01:51:46.78 But if you haven't trained and
01:51:47.02 --> 01:51:52.30 Been been for lack of a better word programed that when you hear a call you're gonna execute
01:51:53.42 --> 01:51:56.46 There's often times when the execution doesn't happen
01:51:57.34 --> 01:52:04.62 The reason I'm bringing this up is because I was thinking about this because the every one of these things the common thing is that somebody's taking action
01:52:04.62 --> 01:52:10.30 It's not someone's making a decision they're making a decision too, but they have to act and even when Dave talks about the Udalupe
01:52:10.46 --> 01:52:11.66 You know, he
01:52:11.66 --> 01:52:14.86 He says that the most important part of the Udalupe is action
01:52:15.50 --> 01:52:20.30 It's action you've got it you've got to take action if you don't take action look you can or observe oriented decide all day long
01:52:20.62 --> 01:52:22.22 If you don't act
01:52:22.22 --> 01:52:25.90 It doesn't matter and same thing with relax look around and make a call hey
01:52:26.22 --> 01:52:29.90 You can relax and orient yourself and observe what's happening and make a call
01:52:29.90 --> 01:52:32.46 But if nobody executes that call you're dead in the water
01:52:32.46 --> 01:52:36.94 So these things are all about actually taking action
01:52:38.70 --> 01:52:43.42 It's a great observation because that's that's the breakdown for a lot of leaders and we see that all the time
01:52:43.42 --> 01:52:46.78 You know it with a decision gets made and we're working with a company and you know
01:52:46.78 --> 01:52:50.78 They've got a problem performer and they don't everything they can't train to mentor them and they okay
01:52:50.78 --> 01:52:53.90 We're gonna have to actually make this decision to to let them go
01:52:54.78 --> 01:52:57.98 And then you come back and talk them six weeks later and the decision got made
01:52:57.98 --> 01:53:05.10 But they never executed and the performer still there and then it takes six months or nine months to get that done and it's so much
01:53:05.10 --> 01:53:11.02 Harker to do then and all the damage has been done and I think that's a great observation to me because it's a
01:53:11.90 --> 01:53:16.38 You know you can make a decision but if you're not actually executing it and it doesn't it gives you
01:53:17.10 --> 01:53:19.34 You're setting yourself back you're losing initiative
01:53:19.90 --> 01:53:22.38 You're wasting you know momentum you're giving your competition
01:53:22.38 --> 01:53:28.30 A leg up and you know to your point earlier like nine times at a ten action is the best thing
01:53:28.30 --> 01:53:31.90 Yeah, take action taking it over step the direction you need to know you need to go
01:53:32.54 --> 01:53:37.74 And it just gives you all the advantage of the world yeah occasionally you could get a pull-toon where
01:53:39.18 --> 01:53:40.94 They're not you know they don't have that
01:53:41.58 --> 01:53:43.58 They don't have that attitude
01:53:43.58 --> 01:53:47.50 Where they're like okay the call's got made and we're gonna go make this happen
01:53:47.98 --> 01:53:50.54 Occasion you would get a pull-toon like that and then it then it would be
01:53:50.54 --> 01:53:55.26 Hey, would you hear that call you got it you got to go get on that you got to make that happen you got it you got to execute
01:53:56.30 --> 01:53:59.10 Like I said don't soon didn't need that they just needed set to
01:53:59.74 --> 01:54:03.58 Freaking relax look around and make a call once the call is getting made do the head experience guys
01:54:03.58 --> 01:54:07.82 And they're like you said you got some you got some JP details and some other freaking guys
01:54:07.82 --> 01:54:10.54 They're gonna make things happen in there. It's it's no factor
01:54:13.66 --> 01:54:15.66 Action
01:54:15.66 --> 01:54:19.90 Next one corporate David W. Lamb US Army
01:54:21.02 --> 01:54:21.98 Korea
01:54:21.98 --> 01:54:23.34 1951
01:54:23.34 --> 01:54:31.10 in October 1951 G company 23rd Infantry Regiment was battling for hail 520 of heartbreak rich
01:54:31.66 --> 01:54:35.82 The company had been withered by repeated fights with the North Korean forces
01:54:35.82 --> 01:54:41.58 Corporal Lamb was acting platoon commander of the third-button of a unit of about 20 soldiers
01:54:42.54 --> 01:54:44.54 so we got the
01:54:44.54 --> 01:54:47.42 That freaking e4 out there acting as a platoon commander
01:54:49.18 --> 01:54:55.42 Following heavy bombardment and supporting fires corporate Lamb's platoon made a direct assault on hail 520
01:54:56.22 --> 01:55:01.50 Upon nearing the enemy Lamb's platoon was halted by enemy fire and began taking casualties
01:55:01.50 --> 01:55:04.94 Lamb called back for reinforcements lieutenant Gano
01:55:07.90 --> 01:55:14.38 Gathered his first platoon and moved towards Lamb's position Gano's platoon began to take casualties and
01:55:14.38 --> 01:55:16.14 halted when the young lieutenant was killed
01:55:17.18 --> 01:55:21.98 Private high stepped into the role of platoon commander and rallied his platoon
01:55:23.42 --> 01:55:30.06 While under fire corporate Lamb directed the use of supporting fires and planned a new route for the enemy attack for the company attack
01:55:30.46 --> 01:55:34.94 After a bitter fight that two platoons breached the enemy defenses during the assault on the position
01:55:34.94 --> 01:55:39.18 Corporal Lamb was wounded private high was now the main effort of the attack
01:55:39.18 --> 01:55:45.42 He directed the remaining soldiers in taking out the bunkers in the enemy defenses using grenades and
01:55:46.46 --> 01:55:48.46 Flame thrillers
01:55:49.42 --> 01:55:55.26 Three hours after the attack had set off the enemy position was secured corporate Lamb's leadership had pulled its platoon and the
01:55:55.26 --> 01:56:00.94 remainder of G company forward through the withering fire in the enemy's position the attack pushed the enemy off
01:56:00.94 --> 01:56:10.62 Hill 520 and important and important step in removing resistance from heartbreak rich you know it's interesting
01:56:10.62 --> 01:56:15.34 I'll a lot of times tell leaders you know you should have if you got
01:56:16.46 --> 01:56:22.62 Seven or eight direct reports you should have two or three of those direct reports that are ready to step up and and take your job
01:56:22.62 --> 01:56:30.62 And and here you got a private you know this guy is this guy is a freaking private
01:56:31.58 --> 01:56:37.82 And he takes charge and makes things happen that's next level right hey it should be imagine me saying hey look
01:56:37.90 --> 01:56:43.58 You got your direct reports and all your direct reports your eight direct reports. You should have two people that are ready to take your job and
01:56:45.58 --> 01:56:49.18 In their direct reports there should be five people that are ready to take your job
01:56:49.18 --> 01:56:51.18 That's impressive
01:56:53.18 --> 01:56:56.54 And if you if you made that your goal that the people
01:56:57.34 --> 01:57:03.18 Not just your subordinates there subordinates there was people that were there there were two levels below you in the chain of plan
01:57:03.18 --> 01:57:07.98 That we're gonna step up and take your job if it need be imagine how effective and efficient those
01:57:08.38 --> 01:57:10.38 Individuals would be
01:57:10.38 --> 01:57:11.34 Freakin awesome
01:57:11.34 --> 01:57:15.10 Like you talk about all the time like every leader should be trying to work themselves out of a job
01:57:15.10 --> 01:57:20.46 And I think it's so hard to do that because our ego is getting involved and like why I want to be the one that makes calls
01:57:21.18 --> 01:57:28.14 You know, but you you insisted on that. I know you'd learn that from from Delta Charlie and and your time in the the seal teams and
01:57:28.62 --> 01:57:38.06 Putting like Ryan Ryan jobes our most junior ranking guy as as a an E3 and we put him in charge of running an entire assault like planning and
01:57:38.06 --> 01:57:45.10 Exkeying that assault and you know, he did get it. It was it made him so much of a greater contributor because he understood
01:57:45.82 --> 01:57:47.34 You know the the
01:57:47.34 --> 01:57:50.22 He understood the challenge of leadership he understood how he could best support
01:57:50.46 --> 01:57:56.46 You know the overall team and then what kind of information we needed to make decisions and I would have never done that without your encouragement
01:57:56.46 --> 01:57:58.30 And in fact, I think I pushed back on a little bit
01:57:58.54 --> 01:58:01.02 You know like he wanted want to let who's your most
01:58:01.74 --> 01:58:04.62 And want you let want you let bickles run this and I was like
01:58:04.62 --> 01:58:09.34 I'm sure about that. I like he said he's brand new and you're like yeah, just let him on it
01:58:09.34 --> 01:58:14.70 Yeah, see what he does it to find you know and that's the crazy thing right there right is like he'll do fine
01:58:15.58 --> 01:58:19.58 And he'll be fine. Yeah, yeah, totally fine. Yeah, he'll do fine. He'll do fine. He'll do fine
01:58:19.58 --> 01:58:23.98 It's like even when we run FTX is like the FTX trading program for civilians
01:58:26.22 --> 01:58:29.10 What I don't know how we had this
01:58:29.10 --> 01:58:33.42 Talk or when it was but the overall the overall
01:58:36.06 --> 01:58:41.90 The overall meaning of the talk was was like that'd be fine like these civilians that got
01:58:43.50 --> 01:58:49.74 45 minutes of training of how to assault the building they're actually gonna do fine. It won't be that big of a deal look
01:58:50.86 --> 01:58:52.38 Is a seal puttune
01:58:52.38 --> 01:58:58.30 Better trained yes, but I'm saying the general idea of what they're doing is gonna be fine. It's gonna be enough to work with and
01:58:59.34 --> 01:59:04.62 And so someone like Bagel's who is like in the platoon and it's going through the workup and understands things
01:59:04.62 --> 01:59:10.14 It's like he he he watch this. He'll do it. I'll do it fine and you know he'll make the same
01:59:10.22 --> 01:59:15.50 They'll make you just did it life babbin the platoon commander from the naval academy, you know
01:59:15.50 --> 01:59:17.50 You just did it and you made
01:59:17.50 --> 01:59:23.26 Four mistakes and Biggles is about to do it and he's gonna make five it's not like
01:59:23.74 --> 01:59:28.38 Life just did it and he made one mistake and Biggles is gonna do it. He's gonna make 80 no, it's like
01:59:28.94 --> 01:59:31.58 It's like seven mistakes and he made three that's
01:59:32.62 --> 01:59:37.10 It's like that crazy and and the the thing that you mentioned about
01:59:37.82 --> 01:59:40.62 How much more it opens up somebody's brain
01:59:41.74 --> 01:59:43.74 When they get to see
01:59:43.74 --> 01:59:48.94 Like all that when you're in charge of on this exactly you can be called it does it with Delta Charlie did does
01:59:48.94 --> 01:59:53.58 Put you hear your in charge this you're running this and all of a sudden instead of me looking at this little tiny sliver of the plan
01:59:54.46 --> 01:59:59.34 And the sliver of the execution I'm looking at this whole big thing and so I see so much more
01:59:59.34 --> 02:00:02.46 See how things are interconnected that was such a powerful
02:00:03.18 --> 02:00:10.22 Love am I gonna use this work. Yes, I am life changing life changing for me to have
02:00:10.22 --> 02:00:19.18 the vision and to have my boss say you're gonna run this and get to run it and see all these things that I'd never seen before
02:00:20.06 --> 02:00:23.34 And be like and then the next mission by the way I'm back to just being a radio man
02:00:23.42 --> 02:00:28.54 But I can see all the connections. I know the importance of job. I know that I my I know that this would help my boss
02:00:28.54 --> 02:00:32.86 I know that this would help the other the other squad leader. I know that I should talk to this guy about
02:00:33.50 --> 02:00:35.50 Just makes you infinitely better
02:00:35.50 --> 02:00:43.50 That was a really powerful lesson that that I learned from you and and saw the impact and I think that
02:00:44.38 --> 02:00:49.02 If leaders can just simply put their ego in check and realize just to your point and you had with those
02:00:49.50 --> 02:00:55.82 Seal button commanders and task and a winner think if you had think if you had 16 or 40 of those guys out there
02:00:56.70 --> 02:01:04.30 Who can see that vision or thinking about not just their task, but everything how can they can help the overall mission and the attempt of the purpose that you're out here
02:01:04.30 --> 02:01:09.66 You know trying to accomplish it's just absolutely life change and game changing and that that team is just
02:01:10.30 --> 02:01:13.98 They just dominate. There's no there's no stopping that team there. They just crush everything
02:01:16.38 --> 02:01:18.38 Some lessons
02:01:18.70 --> 02:01:24.22 Corporal lamb displayed tremendous leadership abilities his fellow soldiers benefited from his competence
02:01:24.54 --> 02:01:31.50 When he assumed command of the platoon and led a company sized attack when the time came for him to command at a higher level
02:01:31.50 --> 02:01:33.50 He was able to shoulder the responsibility
02:01:34.38 --> 02:01:39.18 Tactically proficient corporate lamb had learned the necessary skills for commanding a platoon in combat
02:01:40.46 --> 02:01:44.46 Check he was able to coordinate supporting fires with his company commander
02:01:45.18 --> 02:01:51.26 Direct actions direct the actions of other platoons and inspire the men under his command by his personal leadership
02:01:51.50 --> 02:01:54.78 His knowledge and ability met with the success on the battlefield
02:01:56.14 --> 02:01:59.50 By the way, I got a I got a text from a tilt the other day
02:01:59.50 --> 02:02:02.86 And it was after he listened to a podcast with
02:02:03.82 --> 02:02:09.02 With Dave Burke good deal. Yes good deal Dave. Good deal Dave was telling
02:02:09.98 --> 02:02:13.26 You know talking about calling for bombs calling fire calling for fire in
02:02:14.54 --> 02:02:22.38 Remadi and I don't know the number of times that that Dave was on the ground to drop bombs, but you know it was a lot
02:02:22.70 --> 02:02:24.70 Yeah, it was a lot
02:02:24.70 --> 02:02:28.22 And then tilt listen to it
02:02:29.34 --> 02:02:34.22 I don't was like hey really like listen to your your podcast with Burke
02:02:35.66 --> 02:02:43.66 Let him know that I got to call some fire to only I was an E4 when I did it and and and it is
02:02:45.10 --> 02:02:47.10 You could not
02:02:47.66 --> 02:02:53.18 You could not compare the amount of times that Dave Burke had dropped bombs
02:02:53.18 --> 02:02:57.50 In his entire career including training
02:02:58.62 --> 02:03:05.90 You could not compare that amount with the amount that tilt dropped on one operation one
02:03:05.98 --> 02:03:13.02 Operation where he's sitting at night for 12 hours with continual close air support
02:03:15.50 --> 02:03:19.50 Till we'll make you feel like a baby
02:03:19.50 --> 02:03:23.74 Yeah, I don't think you're I don't think you're measure enough to
02:03:25.26 --> 02:03:28.78 I don't think you measure enough to that in any shape way shape before but look that's you know
02:03:28.78 --> 02:03:33.10 We talk about humility and I think that's anytime I think I've done something or we saw some combat
02:03:33.10 --> 02:03:37.10 You know and you start reading books. I mean every single one of these of these
02:03:37.82 --> 02:03:43.18 Illustrations here. I mean it just just blows away and anything that I saw I did it's incredible
02:03:43.18 --> 02:03:51.26 I will say this though and talk to I did I talk to you know a couple of Vietnam seals that are outstanding
02:03:51.58 --> 02:03:55.98 You know folks and had some awesome experience and it served as seal machine gunners in Vietnam
02:03:55.98 --> 02:04:00.70 And they talked about being in some gun fights and I mean these guys I mean amazing you know
02:04:00.70 --> 02:04:05.42 Incredible people who had awesome experiences are four fathers that created this legacy
02:04:05.42 --> 02:04:09.66 You know for us in the seal teams and when you're talking about a machine seal machine gunners
02:04:09.66 --> 02:04:14.62 You know and how many it was really cool to see our belt film machine getters take campus alive and how awesome they were and
02:04:15.50 --> 02:04:17.66 And we were talking about like how often you know
02:04:17.66 --> 02:04:20.62 I so I asked I asked so one of them good friend of mine
02:04:21.18 --> 02:04:25.34 How many times you have to reload your machine gun? He's like oh man maybe a couple times
02:04:26.14 --> 02:04:29.34 I was like well how many I mean you I mean you must have shot your whole load out a few times you know
02:04:29.58 --> 02:04:30.94 Much of times he's like
02:04:30.94 --> 02:04:34.94 Not all the guy ever shot my whole load up and I was thinking like dude. I still was
02:04:34.94 --> 02:04:40.54 I was just saying I'm gonna shot the entire 600 round load out and then maybe four or five hundred more rounds there
02:04:40.54 --> 02:04:47.26 But he also is carrying like all the time on so many of those operations. Yeah, the I had the same
02:04:47.26 --> 02:04:52.78 Conversation with with what I had this exact same conversation with one
02:04:53.66 --> 02:04:59.26 You know badass four father Vietnam seal who is a machine gunner in nom and
02:04:59.90 --> 02:05:01.98 He said the same thing you know he was like
02:05:01.98 --> 02:05:07.26 I think he said he's like yeah, we got in six fire fights, but that's what I also learned is that
02:05:07.90 --> 02:05:13.66 Much like current seal deployments you could have one seal deployment in Vietnam where you go to a certain
02:05:13.66 --> 02:05:18.14 A.o. and the enemies act in a certain way and it's freaking like daily
02:05:19.18 --> 02:05:23.50 Craziness and they were doing what they oh, yeah, they do since they would do squad operations
02:05:23.50 --> 02:05:28.22 So they go every other night your squad my squad your squad my squad and they would do operations all the time
02:05:28.22 --> 02:05:30.22 so it is also
02:05:30.22 --> 02:05:38.30 You know based on the particular a.o that you know that you were in I mean even when we were when we were in Ramadi the guys that were over in another city
02:05:38.38 --> 02:05:40.78 You know whatever not not that far away
02:05:41.42 --> 02:05:46.78 Some of those guys didn't didn't I don't know if they got in fire fights, so I mean they got you know two or three
02:05:46.78 --> 02:05:52.54 So it's one of those things where I hate to use this word by gotta get a lucky way your a.o
02:05:52.54 --> 02:05:55.34 You know and then of course you gotta make your own luck
02:05:55.34 --> 02:06:01.34 Next up sergeant Steven Bouchard
02:06:02.54 --> 02:06:10.14 US Marine Corps Vietnam 1967 in July of 1967 first Battalion ninth Marines took part in
02:06:10.14 --> 02:06:14.70 Operation Buffalo designed to defend the border between north and south Vietnam known as the
02:06:14.70 --> 02:06:20.86 D milleterized zone during this operation of Italian was ambushed by an entire North Vietnamese army
02:06:20.86 --> 02:06:27.26 Regiment and took very heavy casualties the first and second Battalion's third Marines were sent to rescue
02:06:27.26 --> 02:06:32.78 One-nine and stabilize the area sergeant Bouchard served as the right guide for second Battoon A company
02:06:33.10 --> 02:06:37.58 One-three the platoon's mission was to clear the area where one nine had left their dead
02:06:39.58 --> 02:06:42.14 As a company moved out of its positions
02:06:42.14 --> 02:06:47.42 Second Battoon came under heavy shell fire the platoon commander was wounded and had to be met
02:06:47.42 --> 02:06:54.14 In fact the platoon sergeant took command the NVA began firing from bunkers in the far tree line
02:06:55.02 --> 02:06:59.82 The platoon sergeant froze with fear leaving the platoon without leadership
02:07:00.86 --> 02:07:07.18 Sergeant Bouchard unhesitatingly took command of the platoon and played an important role in the company's subsequent actions
02:07:07.18 --> 02:07:13.10 Sergeant Bouchard's strong leadership pulled the platoon through the horrible task of retrieving the corpses of one nine
02:07:13.10 --> 02:07:18.30 While under enemy fire while manning a defensive position a breach in the Battalion line was created between
02:07:18.30 --> 02:07:21.10 Bouchard's platoon and the adjacent B company
02:07:21.10 --> 02:07:27.26 Bouchard's platoon counterattack into the breach and sealed off the NVA who had infiltrated the perimeter
02:07:28.30 --> 02:07:32.94 His unit then made contact with approaching forces wearing Marine gear
02:07:34.14 --> 02:07:39.02 Sergeant Bouchard ordered his Marines to hold their fire until the figures had come into
02:07:39.02 --> 02:07:46.22 Within hand grenade range at that time Bouchard decided to open fire on the approaching soldiers who were NVA
02:07:46.54 --> 02:07:49.50 wearing stolen gear from the dead of the one nine
02:07:50.78 --> 02:07:57.10 Bouchard's tactical actions broke the enemy attack and the Marines went on the offensive
02:07:58.38 --> 02:08:03.34 Sergeant Bouchard remained in command of second platoon until the unit was ordered to pull out a
02:08:03.34 --> 02:08:07.90 One three was the last unit to leave the battlefield before B52 strikes leveled the area
02:08:11.98 --> 02:08:17.18 Sergeant Bouchard was both willing and able to take responsibility of leading the platoon
02:08:18.06 --> 02:08:22.38 His tactical skills allowed the platoon to play a major role in the company's combat operation
02:08:22.38 --> 02:08:25.02 Sergeant Bouchard was able to take charge by being decisive
02:08:26.70 --> 02:08:31.66 We recorded a whole thing yesterday on for EF online on being decisive
02:08:31.66 --> 02:08:37.58 The squad leaders did not respond to the platoon sergeant who was too fearful to lead
02:08:38.78 --> 02:08:44.30 Sergeant Bouchard took decisive action and was not afraid to make tough decisions and carry out difficult tasks
02:08:45.98 --> 02:08:47.58 And once again, what do you do? You took action
02:08:48.94 --> 02:08:50.94 Take taking action
02:08:51.42 --> 02:08:55.90 His decision to open fire on the individuals in Marine uniforms required decisiveness and acceptance of
02:08:55.90 --> 02:08:57.42 Responsibility
02:08:57.42 --> 02:09:04.70 Sergeant Bouchard led his platoon by example many Marines were devastated by the sight of the Marine dead left behind by one nine
02:09:05.98 --> 02:09:09.10 Sergeant Bouchard's capable and firm leadership held
02:09:09.10 --> 02:09:15.50 Second platoon together and that right there. I mean this is just devastating you know you know we talked about
02:09:16.54 --> 02:09:23.50 How how much it hurt to see an American tank burning in in the streets in Ramadi
02:09:23.50 --> 02:09:31.26 I mean can you imagine your platoon is now out there just recovering body after body after body
02:09:31.82 --> 02:09:37.82 of your fellow Marines? I mean it's a it's a nightmare and and obviously they didn't go into it too much
02:09:38.38 --> 02:09:42.54 And I all have to do some research and if I can find any more information about this but
02:09:42.54 --> 02:09:53.34 You know they clearly mentioned it here many Marines were devastated by the sight of the Marine dead left behind by one nine
02:09:53.82 --> 02:09:57.98 Realizing that his unit had to be at the right place at the right time in order to make a different
02:09:57.98 --> 02:10:02.54 Sergeant Bouchard led a counter attack to plug the gap in the lines between A and B companies
02:10:02.54 --> 02:10:10.06 This platoon level tactical action secured the company flank and prevented the battalion from being split and overrun
02:10:10.06 --> 02:10:12.06 And
02:10:12.06 --> 02:10:17.66 There's a quote here from the German army that says it's better to have a good sergeant in command than a bad officer
02:10:19.50 --> 02:10:22.38 We'll take that one. That's that's a great quote right there
02:10:27.58 --> 02:10:36.46 Corporal Lester A Tully US Marine Corps Vietnam 1968 the 1968 Ted offensive took American forces in Vietnam by surprise
02:10:36.46 --> 02:10:42.22 Way city the ancient Imperial capital of Vietnam was quickly overrun by the North Vietnamese army
02:10:42.86 --> 02:10:44.06 The NBA
02:10:44.06 --> 02:10:53.10 Given the mission of relieving the first Arvin division command post to G company second battalion fifth Marines advanced on foot through the city
02:10:54.22 --> 02:10:59.82 The first Arvin division Cp was located at the northern corner of the Citadel
02:10:59.82 --> 02:11:05.90 A historic fortress G companies rude of advance would take them right through the Citadel
02:11:07.26 --> 02:11:15.26 The company advanced along highway one with second platoon in the lead until it became necessary to cross a bridge over the perfume river
02:11:16.38 --> 02:11:19.58 Just as the lead squad crested the center of the span
02:11:19.58 --> 02:11:29.34 An NVA machine gun in place to name fortified bunker open fire the company was pinned on the bridge and the lead squad took multiple casualties
02:11:31.42 --> 02:11:39.98 An M60 was set up to counter the NVA position, but the team leader was killed moments later as sparked flew from enemy rounds hitting the bridge structure
02:11:40.30 --> 02:11:43.36 Corporal Tully decided to take matters into his own hands
02:11:43.74 --> 02:11:47.02 Corporal Tully was second squad leader of second platoon
02:11:47.02 --> 02:11:52.06 On the bridge his squad was located directly behind the lead squad
02:11:52.46 --> 02:11:57.50 Assessing the situation corporal Tully decided upon a course of action that would allow his company to advance
02:11:58.38 --> 02:12:01.42 Realizing that his squad was protected from fire and
02:12:01.98 --> 02:12:10.22 Was the nearest to the enemy corporal Tully charged up a walkway and threw a grenade into the enemy position killing five NVA and
02:12:10.46 --> 02:12:14.18 Silencing the position the company followed corporal Tully squad
02:12:14.18 --> 02:12:18.82 Cross the bridge and advanced upon the citadel as the company neared the citadel
02:12:18.82 --> 02:12:24.70 It met heavy resistance from northern Vietnamese army regulars while forced to withdraw Gulf two-fied
02:12:25.26 --> 02:12:34.06 Gulf two-fied clarify the situation around the citadel American commanders had gained a much needed clear picture of how strong the enemy was in a way city
02:12:34.50 --> 02:12:40.50 Now the American commanders could concentrate on what to do rather than wondering what was going on
02:12:40.50 --> 02:12:48.78 That's a you know, we used to set up the the old barricade attutor down the hallway
02:12:49.18 --> 02:12:53.22 This is just an awful one a barricade attutor down the bridge
02:12:56.10 --> 02:13:00.88 And what are you gonna do you got down to men on that bridge because you think oh, well, I'll just jump off the bridge
02:13:00.88 --> 02:13:03.06 It would be okay. What about your wounded friends up there?
02:13:03.38 --> 02:13:05.78 So you can't just abandon it. It's a nightmare
02:13:05.78 --> 02:13:12.42 What's up with the what's up with a grenade killing five NVA?
02:13:12.42 --> 02:13:14.42 That's a that must have been a
02:13:15.42 --> 02:13:20.78 That's a tight shot. They must have been closely grouped. I mean like way tightly grouped
02:13:21.58 --> 02:13:24.58 That's a well well thrown grenade
02:13:26.42 --> 02:13:29.54 I always love that that that you know the I guess
02:13:29.54 --> 02:13:34.82 Yeah, the American grenades being like baseball's
02:13:36.38 --> 02:13:39.94 Baseball side and the Germans they couldn't they couldn't hang
02:13:40.74 --> 02:13:46.04 Because they play soccer and so they you know the potato match of grenades echoed Charles
02:13:46.04 --> 02:13:50.66 You know you ever seen a of a grenade with like a long stick on one end of it
02:13:50.66 --> 02:13:54.50 Yeah, like on red don't yeah, so that's called a potato matcher because it looks like something you know
02:13:54.50 --> 02:14:00.10 But the reason that it was created was you can use it like with leverage to throw further
02:14:00.50 --> 02:14:03.30 Yeah, because you can't kick a grenade like it's a soccer ball
02:14:04.14 --> 02:14:07.82 So they couldn't throw like a merit you take an American kid man come on
02:14:07.82 --> 02:14:11.74 He's gonna take that little baseball size creating it's hooked that thing strike
02:14:11.74 --> 02:14:15.02 He's gonna put it into a machine gun pick go five people
02:14:15.02 --> 02:14:19.82 Accuracy freaking awesome. Yeah, if you remember from from easy company that with with the
02:14:19.82 --> 02:14:26.02 The two five oh six the band of band of brothers if you see the the tell me she'll read the book
02:14:26.02 --> 02:14:31.86 But remember buck Compton was a all American catcher for UCLA's baseball team
02:14:32.06 --> 02:14:38.06 He was apparently direct line drive hitting German soldiers with with him
02:14:38.06 --> 02:14:40.06 That's so freaking after
02:14:40.94 --> 02:14:47.78 That's so epic. I was uh when I was going through STT like the what became S QT
02:14:47.78 --> 02:14:53.86 So you know the get done with basic skill training and the issue up with a team and then they put you through training and
02:14:53.86 --> 02:14:57.78 That we we went to a grenade course, which was just run by team guys
02:14:57.78 --> 02:15:00.02 But we were throwing pineapple grenades
02:15:00.98 --> 02:15:04.98 Straight up pineapple grenades the crates were marked 1947
02:15:05.42 --> 02:15:10.70 What's the pineapple grenade like that your dish looking grenade? It sort of looks like a pineapple
02:15:11.30 --> 02:15:17.26 It's got the little like spikes spikes on it's like like a like a like a like a quad pattern
02:15:17.26 --> 02:15:21.30 Oh, yeah, it's just like a stereo typical grenade. Oh, yeah, like okay
02:15:21.30 --> 02:15:26.22 What you look like if someone's gonna get a tattoo of a grenade, right? That's what they get okay
02:15:26.22 --> 02:15:30.66 So the and then what then the kind of modern grenades? That's just the round just yeah
02:15:30.66 --> 02:15:35.28 It just looks round but that that those pineapple grenades so we go up there and
02:15:36.38 --> 02:15:38.38 This is just dumb team guys stuff
02:15:38.38 --> 02:15:43.66 So we start throwing these grenades and like a bunch of them are not working because they're whatever at that time
02:15:43.66 --> 02:15:47.58 Like 50 years old or something crazy like that. It's where Huck in these grenades and
02:15:49.30 --> 02:15:55.50 The chief that was running the training who it was a freaking like a bad ass team guy
02:15:55.50 --> 02:15:58.38 I'm at a fact Tony mentioned him because he he died
02:15:59.22 --> 02:16:04.50 But the same as Tim Feral and so we're throwing these grenades and when they would so if if you threw a grenade
02:16:04.50 --> 02:16:09.38 It didn't go off the protocol was shut down the range call EOD
02:16:09.38 --> 02:16:15.38 EOD can come out there whatever in five hours and you're gonna sit there for five hours waiting for them to show up
02:16:15.78 --> 02:16:20.78 So Tim Feral didn't want us to miss training so he's going out on the range
02:16:21.42 --> 02:16:28.26 He'd like be like he'd give it like whatever a few minutes and then he'd take another grenade another freaking
02:16:29.90 --> 02:16:32.10 Old rusty pineapple grenade
02:16:32.10 --> 02:16:37.30 He would go up pull the pin said it down next to the one that was the dud after he went around the report
02:16:37.30 --> 02:16:39.70 That's balls he said it down and then run back
02:16:40.42 --> 02:16:43.38 I jump into the pit and did I'm a new guy?
02:16:43.38 --> 02:16:46.42 I'm like Dandy this dude's a bad guy. It's like this guy's crazy
02:16:46.82 --> 02:16:51.94 But that's you know that's how if you out there running hand grenade range is do not do not do they do not do that
02:16:52.42 --> 02:16:56.74 Do not do that not advisable like I said dumb team guy stuff
02:16:57.46 --> 02:17:00.70 Freaking don't real dumb those those pineapple grenades
02:17:00.70 --> 02:17:03.86 So that you know the M67 which is the moderate rout grenades were used that
02:17:03.86 --> 02:17:10.66 It the frag pattern is so much the the scrap frag is tiny it breaks up into those little little small piece
02:17:10.66 --> 02:17:13.30 Where the pineapple guys got the big old chunks and that's what the
02:17:13.78 --> 02:17:15.38 That's what the the
02:17:15.38 --> 02:17:17.98 Insurgents had in reminding yeah cover all those
02:17:17.98 --> 02:17:19.98 Oh, yeah, they have those
02:17:19.98 --> 02:17:24.94 They have those Russian ones that are more cylindrical. They're cylindrical and they still have the grid pattern on them
02:17:25.26 --> 02:17:29.42 You'll hear cover to bunch of those out of that that one moss that we cleared within Iraqi soldiers
02:17:30.62 --> 02:17:32.62 Imagine that
02:17:32.62 --> 02:17:34.62 You get so much
02:17:34.62 --> 02:17:39.98 So you don't use the pineapple grenades at all no long time no dang that's kind of the iconic
02:17:40.70 --> 02:17:44.02 Look, yeah, that's what I'm saying if you're gonna get a tattoo of a grenade
02:17:44.02 --> 02:17:48.54 You're gonna get that one most like I've never seen anyone of the M67 grenade tattoo review
02:17:49.18 --> 02:17:54.70 Yeah, cuz it's kind of round right it doesn't quite have the kind of boring. Yeah, I was looking
02:17:55.18 --> 02:17:57.18 Unless you're hooking it
02:17:57.18 --> 02:18:03.50 You're kind of pumped I'm okay. I remember some of those son of those pineapple the Russian pineapple grades
02:18:03.50 --> 02:18:04.70 Those things were heavy
02:18:04.70 --> 02:18:05.70 That was true
02:18:05.70 --> 02:18:08.10 I'll tell them more on the film for sure
02:18:08.10 --> 02:18:11.58 It seemed like most well like you said the frag was a heavier
02:18:12.06 --> 02:18:17.82 You know like just that just the metal was heavy. I don't know what they're explosive weight was off top of my head
02:18:18.66 --> 02:18:20.66 They're definitely bigger
02:18:20.66 --> 02:18:25.66 They make a big boom. I can tell you that so there's different sizes of grenades or no
02:18:25.66 --> 02:18:32.14 Yes, they're all like so well you mentioned that the grenade killed however many guys in one shot
02:18:32.78 --> 02:18:38.02 That was more a statement of like that must have been a hell of a shot and the guys must have been close together
02:18:38.02 --> 02:18:43.56 Because a grenade is a very small explosive. I mean, it's a small five five meter kill range
02:18:45.22 --> 02:18:48.50 Yeah, so it's yeah, if they're all cruising together boom
02:18:48.50 --> 02:18:56.14 There's a no-for-acco Charles though that the movie master the so that the five meter kill radius for M67 are our
02:18:56.14 --> 02:19:00.82 Our hang grenade a frag grenades the same it's the same kill radius for a golden egg
02:19:00.82 --> 02:19:08.04 Which is a 40 millimeter grenade that you shoot out of your your M203 grenade launcher are the old school M79 that we we carried and
02:19:09.18 --> 02:19:15.70 Unlike what you might see in the movie commando when when you when you shoot a 40 millimeter grenade
02:19:15.70 --> 02:19:22.74 The building doesn't blow up and we had several times where it just it fragged people and they run off
02:19:22.74 --> 02:19:24.84 It's a common this
02:19:24.84 --> 02:19:31.50 disappointing. No, that's a common misconception that actually is true in commando is actually factually the proof that it
02:19:32.90 --> 02:19:38.82 Well, I'll get a say is I tried that many times and as an officer, you know my job is to stand back and and
02:19:38.82 --> 02:19:40.82 High point my weapon and be detached
02:19:40.82 --> 02:19:46.68 But that also means that if I'm in the back, I can shoot some 40 millimeter nades and we we've shot quite a few of those things
02:19:46.68 --> 02:19:52.000 Which is awesome. I remember you often coming back with a empty band leaders
02:19:54.38 --> 02:20:00.02 So wait on predator no no no, they started totally it started
02:20:01.14 --> 02:20:07.80 Remember the the scene on predator just even to a plane and get a blame since I don't I don't have time to bleed right remember that part
02:20:07.80 --> 02:20:12.54 Yep, okay, you bleed and then like I ponds Jose, okay, do you have time to duck exactly?
02:20:12.54 --> 02:20:15.14 He came out shot is that the 40 millimeter?
02:20:15.14 --> 02:20:19.000 That's a 40 meter. Yeah, I had a M203. So he's launching that into the
02:20:19.72 --> 02:20:27.48 Unlight like look it would definitely keep guys heads down and if we did have we had a couple guys that discord score some direct hits with a 40 millimeter
02:20:27.48 --> 02:20:30.92 Which is if you take one of those in the chest. It's game over for you
02:20:33.04 --> 02:20:35.04 That was pretty epic, but
02:20:35.04 --> 02:20:40.88 But there there is what what doesn't happen is like you saw a predator where you launched a 40 millimeter
02:20:41.52 --> 02:20:48.12 40 40 mic mic into a bunker and like a giant explosion happens and six guys go flying
02:20:48.12 --> 02:20:52.16 I'm picking the air and all directions that doesn't happen. That was pretty disappointed
02:20:52.80 --> 02:20:58.48 Did you see my Instagram post where is that hey people are parking in front of my driveway and then I shoot the cars? Yes
02:20:58.48 --> 02:21:00.48 Is that a 40 millimeter?
02:21:00.48 --> 02:21:03.12 I mean I guess I thought you had a rocket. What about a rocket?
02:21:03.12 --> 02:21:05.28 I was like one you know the big I
02:21:06.24 --> 02:21:11.24 Think like six of them fit in there. Oh, you know what you did have you had the street sweeper
02:21:11.24 --> 02:21:14.78 There's a street sweeper 40 millimeter, which the Marines had
02:21:15.04 --> 02:21:19.08 The right Marines had some and they're heavy, but it's pretty awesome
02:21:19.08 --> 02:21:25.16 It's just a cylinder and so yeah, you can just launch a whole bunch of yeah, it's basically like a gigantic revolver
02:21:25.16 --> 02:21:27.16 It with 40 millimeter
02:21:27.16 --> 02:21:30.76 That wasn't real it was real, but I don't look at the tag
02:21:30.76 --> 02:21:36.48 The what he called the instructions or whatever the name I did shoot some vehicles with 40 mic mic
02:21:36.48 --> 02:21:39.40 It does create quite an explosion and if you can ignite the gas
02:21:39.40 --> 02:21:44.48 You know then it will catch on fire there was an a gigantic explosion that happened
02:21:44.48 --> 02:21:48.52 That was a little disappointing. You're that you got to go in good deal day for the bombs
02:21:49.16 --> 02:21:54.36 There's just not that much explosive inside I mean you'll like how big an
02:21:54.36 --> 02:22:01.52 Amadeus, yeah, I mean think of how big an Amadeus, well, then think of how big a greatest I mean I can just kind of multiply that and
02:22:01.88 --> 02:22:08.48 You're gonna get something similar. So do you remember that they gave us the thermo barric 40 mic mics?
02:22:08.48 --> 02:22:15.48 I do remember that which which create a much larger explosion and supposed to kill people with the overpressure and they gave us a bunch of like couple
02:22:15.48 --> 02:22:18.80 Several cases of them and that was supposed to last the entire deployment and
02:22:18.80 --> 02:22:26.08 We shot every single one of them on one operation within about a one hour period
02:22:27.48 --> 02:22:34.28 Which was awesome that was awesome, but what was also additionally awesome was I got an email follow up and
02:22:35.48 --> 02:22:37.48 The fuck they said
02:22:37.48 --> 02:22:39.48 He said something like
02:22:39.48 --> 02:22:44.24 Hey, we're wondering if you've had a chance to utilize the because they were they were testing them
02:22:44.24 --> 02:22:50.44 We're wondering if they've had a chance to if you've had a chance to use any of these thermo barric or need 40 millimeter grenades
02:22:51.16 --> 02:22:54.44 And have you had a chance to fire any of them yet and I was like
02:22:55.16 --> 02:22:56.76 I was like hey life
02:22:56.76 --> 02:23:00.84 Have you you shot some of those hours? I was shot all of them
02:23:01.16 --> 02:23:04.76 I know how were they like they were awesome and I just wrote back
02:23:05.32 --> 02:23:07.32 Worked good send more
02:23:07.96 --> 02:23:09.96 I think I think I asked for more of them
02:23:09.96 --> 02:23:14.72 The only thing that was different is that they they were much heavier because they're a lot larger and they're exposed
02:23:14.72 --> 02:23:17.84 And as much much more powerful so little closer to what you might expect
02:23:18.64 --> 02:23:21.92 But you got a count for that in the trajectory because
02:23:22.64 --> 02:23:27.40 You're dope in it yet. What are you aiming at is they're falling like you know 50 meter sure?
02:23:27.40 --> 02:23:31.000 Yeah, that's kind of hard to dope in on me can't mark me
02:23:32.16 --> 02:23:35.64 It's roll out dope in your 40 my like that's crazy
02:23:35.64 --> 02:23:40.20 All right the lessons from that one corporal Tully
02:23:41.76 --> 02:23:46.56 New the mission of the company was to relieve the first Arab and division headquarters
02:23:47.04 --> 02:23:55.04 When the company was halted by fire he took decisive action in support of the commanders intent to free up the movement of the company
02:23:55.48 --> 02:23:57.48 So the mission could be continued
02:23:58.92 --> 02:24:03.04 Corporal call he acted corporal Tully acted on his own initiative
02:24:03.04 --> 02:24:06.76 Being the second in the company formation
02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:13.52 He was in the best position to evaluate the situation and take advantage of the opportunity
02:24:14.12 --> 02:24:16.12 Developed by the point squad
02:24:19.36 --> 02:24:24.64 So what we have here again we've got somebody that's in a position
02:24:26.32 --> 02:24:27.96 They're not the leader
02:24:27.96 --> 02:24:32.28 This isn't the gunnery sergeant. This isn't the platoon commander. This isn't the company commander
02:24:32.28 --> 02:24:35.28 This is the squad leader
02:24:36.76 --> 02:24:38.76 Who takes action and
02:24:39.56 --> 02:24:41.56 Makes a difference and
02:24:41.88 --> 02:24:51.24 Look we we saw this kind of thing all the time and we were lucky enough to work alongside the army work alongside the Marine Corps and see
02:24:52.80 --> 02:24:56.96 You know not just from our own pltunes not just from Charlie and Delta Tunes see our
02:24:56.96 --> 02:25:05.32 The young he fives and step up and make things happen. We got to see things like this we get to see things like this all the time all the time
02:25:07.44 --> 02:25:12.38 You gotta you gotta think about how young these guys any experience these squad leaders are as well too
02:25:12.38 --> 02:25:15.22 And then I was you know as we're reading here in those stories
02:25:15.22 --> 02:25:17.22 I'm thinking about a
02:25:17.22 --> 02:25:22.52 Young squad leader that we worked with from three eight Marines Lima company named Joe Tomsey
02:25:22.52 --> 02:25:28.52 Corporal Joe Tomsey and we did probably it doesn't operations with Corporal Tomsey and his squad
02:25:29.56 --> 02:25:38.48 And we learned a lot from those guys. I mean they had been in Ramadi for several months prior to us and it fought through some of the most difficult dangers neighborhoods
02:25:38.96 --> 02:25:42.16 And he was he was 21 years old
02:25:43.52 --> 02:25:49.44 So here's areas in charge of a squad of Marines leading those Marines of beloved squad leader
02:25:49.44 --> 02:25:52.68 Stepping up and making calls supporting the chain of command
02:25:53.68 --> 02:25:57.68 You know and just just executing again things done and I
02:25:58.64 --> 02:26:02.54 Had so much respect and you know to build a work with with a Marine like that and and
02:26:03.76 --> 02:26:11.16 Tragedically Corporal Tomsey was killed on August 2nd 2006 the same day that we lost Mark Lee same day Ryan Joe was shot
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000 and blinded and
02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:18.68 We we lined up next to those Marines from three eight Lima company
02:26:18.68 --> 02:26:26.20 And we put both Joe Tomsey and Mark Lee on that angel flight the same time and I remember the silence of
02:26:26.72 --> 02:26:31.54 Of all the Marines next to us as as our seals from Charlotte with two carrying those
02:26:31.88 --> 02:26:37.12 That our brothers in body back to putting them on that angel flight as they took off and just the
02:26:37.48 --> 02:26:44.88 The glow of that of that helicopter going going going around as they took off the fly those guys out and
02:26:44.88 --> 02:26:52.36 What a loss. I mean just seeing how crushed those Marines were losing their brother and this bull of squad leader
02:26:52.36 --> 02:26:55.60 And I was just thinking about us as we're hearing those stories
02:26:56.24 --> 02:27:02.16 It's hard to imagine that these guys how young they were you know a guy like Corporal Tomsey 21 years old
02:27:02.52 --> 02:27:08.78 It with all that you know, we just limited life experience and yet in this massive position of responsibility
02:27:08.78 --> 02:27:16.30 They're playing such key roles and in in women other teams succeed to fails and just my hats off all the squad leaders out there and
02:27:17.06 --> 02:27:23.94 What are not going to work with the guy like that and to reflect on on the impact that he had on all the Marines that he'd be led
02:27:23.94 --> 02:27:37.22 Yeah, that was um
02:27:43.78 --> 02:27:47.18 I think that's probably a pretty good place to stop for today
02:27:47.18 --> 02:27:52.42 We got some more we got some more things to cover and
02:27:59.30 --> 02:28:02.94 It's important to remember that these guys
02:28:05.54 --> 02:28:10.10 You know the guys that we're talking about in this book when you're talking about Corporal Tomsey when you're talking about Mark
02:28:10.10 --> 02:28:17.98 You know, we talk about now they make a difference on the battlefield and make a strategic impact, but
02:28:20.50 --> 02:28:25.52 Their actions and the way they lived in the example that they sent definitely have
02:28:26.66 --> 02:28:31.30 made a difference in the way that I think in the way that you think and
02:28:33.70 --> 02:28:37.94 The impact that they had not just on the battlefield, but
02:28:37.94 --> 02:28:43.54 To see an example to be examples of what a leader is and
02:28:46.94 --> 02:28:51.82 More important what a person can be
02:28:58.82 --> 02:29:00.82 And
02:29:00.82 --> 02:29:09.22 Like I said, well, we'll pick this up on the on the next one but
02:29:09.78 --> 02:29:11.78 From from these stories that we heard already
02:29:14.70 --> 02:29:18.78 You know, I get referring back to taking action and and
02:29:20.46 --> 02:29:25.78 These these squad leaders they take action and they and they make a difference
02:29:25.78 --> 02:29:27.78 And
02:29:28.90 --> 02:29:34.02 And that applies to us as individuals our actions
02:29:35.02 --> 02:29:42.78 Make a difference our actions that we take as people make a difference not just on the battlefield not just in business
02:29:44.90 --> 02:29:46.90 But in life
02:29:46.90 --> 02:29:48.90 So
02:29:54.74 --> 02:29:59.38 Step up take action and make a difference
02:30:06.34 --> 02:30:08.34 All right echo Charles
02:30:08.66 --> 02:30:13.38 It's been a while, but I need some help over here. Yes, sir. I want you to talk for a little bit
02:30:13.38 --> 02:30:19.86 All right, well, I didn't talk about taking action, which I agree with obviously
02:30:21.14 --> 02:30:27.70 Well, we're gonna start small about that as far as taking action goes so the best action that we can take
02:30:28.90 --> 02:30:32.18 To improve is to improve our physical
02:30:33.46 --> 02:30:37.62 Starts there this is this is essentially the foundation for
02:30:37.62 --> 02:30:45.62 Pretty much all other action when you think about it. Okay, I was feeling like obviously
02:30:45.62 --> 02:30:48.90 I was getting a little bit emotional there. I'm done now. You can stop talking
02:30:51.30 --> 02:30:56.50 Okay, we're trying to cool down. I think I'm cool. We're good. Good. What I was gonna say is we got to start small
02:30:56.98 --> 02:31:02.66 Okay, we're not all we're not all dressing up like rebels, you know with our friends going in and shooting the rebel
02:31:02.66 --> 02:31:08.26 We're not all doing that. Okay, okay, sure. That was epic. That was most of us are just kind of you know
02:31:08.90 --> 02:31:12.10 Just going day to day with her, you know with our lives and
02:31:12.98 --> 02:31:15.94 Tactically and strategically trying to do the right thing all right
02:31:16.66 --> 02:31:20.98 Starting small best way to take action or the best thing to do
02:31:21.86 --> 02:31:23.86 Is to maintain or improve our physical
02:31:23.86 --> 02:31:32.98 Well, let's just say it's a great place. That's a great. It's a great place to start. Yes, we like it. Yes, sir. Can't argue. No can't so
02:31:34.74 --> 02:31:36.74 Improving physical health takes
02:31:37.30 --> 02:31:41.94 What I used to call beat down to get a beat down your body a little bit varying levels of beat-dumps
02:31:42.58 --> 02:31:44.58 We all worked out today a
02:31:44.58 --> 02:31:47.86 Affirmative some of us plan to work
02:31:47.86 --> 02:31:52.18 Oh, did you not want to go out to the world right now yet? I'm working on later. So I'm saying
02:31:53.46 --> 02:31:58.02 He was he was saying I echo echo was called me out earlier for not throwing around the hundo
02:31:59.30 --> 02:32:06.34 The hundo kettlebells life you're in a good amount for two days. Would you be more consistent if you work with your work out?
02:32:06.34 --> 02:32:10.82 If you lived in San Diego with me or like near me hundred percent
02:32:10.82 --> 02:32:18.66 Yeah, check. So that was like what if life really was to show up at my house in five o'clock at the morning
02:32:19.22 --> 02:32:22.98 Then you get there. Well, how do you feel when you get there? How do you feel once you're working out?
02:32:22.98 --> 02:32:27.86 That's how do you feel once you're done? That's the best the best. It's the best and luckily
02:32:27.86 --> 02:32:33.46 I got I got an early crossfit class that I usually hit a five-thirty in the morning get up at four 30 stretch out
02:32:33.78 --> 02:32:38.74 And that's and that's in dripping yeah dripping springs crossfit second wave. Yeah awesome
02:32:38.74 --> 02:32:43.46 Plug coming out you crossfit second wave awesome jam how many classes do you have?
02:32:44.34 --> 02:32:46.66 Four five a day yeah outstanding coaches
02:32:48.10 --> 02:32:49.06 Great
02:32:49.06 --> 02:32:50.42 Great instruction
02:32:50.42 --> 02:32:56.82 So after here's a question. I have a question for you. Okay, straight up. You're all like okay
02:32:59.06 --> 02:33:02.50 Okay, so you know what you just said like life would you do you think you
02:33:02.50 --> 02:33:08.58 Perforasing could you make work out if you live in San Diego right so the whole accountability you know early workouts
02:33:08.58 --> 02:33:10.58 Okay, he's gonna get his part yeah
02:33:11.14 --> 02:33:17.22 So you have this thing where and this kind of me just assuming where you know when you have a workout partner
02:33:17.46 --> 02:33:19.46 Your way less likely to skip workouts
02:33:20.10 --> 02:33:24.74 Right, so for you you might think of yourself like you know it doesn't apply to me because our
02:33:24.74 --> 02:33:29.54 It's good to work out till no kind of thing right, but do you believe that that's a sound theory?
02:33:29.54 --> 02:33:32.34 I do believe it's a sound theory. Yeah, it is right. Yeah, it is
02:33:33.46 --> 02:33:36.58 Yeah, so when jocos like all right. I'll see it five
02:33:36.98 --> 02:33:38.98 You're gonna be there yeah
