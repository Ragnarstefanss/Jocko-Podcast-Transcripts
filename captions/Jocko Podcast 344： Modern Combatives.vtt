00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.56
This is Jocko podcast number 344 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:03.56 --> 00:00:05.32
Jocko willing, good evening Echo.

3
00:00:05.32 --> 00:00:06.16
Good evening.

4
00:00:06.16 --> 00:00:08.36
Also joining us tonight, Dean Lister.

5
00:00:08.36 --> 00:00:09.20
Good evening.

6
00:00:09.20 --> 00:00:10.16
Good evening Dean.

7
00:00:10.16 --> 00:00:14.000
Dean Lister from podcast 137, if you haven't heard that,

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.28
go listen to it, Dean is,

9
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:18.88
is it safe to say Dean's one of the greatest grapplers

10
00:00:18.88 --> 00:00:20.20
of all time?

11
00:00:20.20 --> 00:00:21.64
I have to ask Echo Charles.

12
00:00:21.64 --> 00:00:22.60
Is it safe to say that?

13
00:00:22.60 --> 00:00:24.44
It is safe to say yes.

14
00:00:24.44 --> 00:00:28.36
Like Jiu Jitsu world champion, is that accurate?

15
00:00:28.36 --> 00:00:31.20
Yeah, Abu Dhabi was like the hardest tournament.

16
00:00:31.20 --> 00:00:32.20
Submission.

17
00:00:32.20 --> 00:00:34.44
I won it three times, two times.

18
00:00:34.44 --> 00:00:36.84
Super fights, absolute in my division.

19
00:00:36.84 --> 00:00:39.60
So I guess, I don't know, best, it's always relative.

20
00:00:39.60 --> 00:00:41.48
Well, we could at least at a minimum,

21
00:00:41.48 --> 00:00:42.92
we could say he's a good grappler.

22
00:00:42.92 --> 00:00:43.76
Yes sir.

23
00:00:43.76 --> 00:00:44.64
It's safe to say he's a good grappler.

24
00:00:44.64 --> 00:00:45.48
I agree with that.

25
00:00:45.48 --> 00:00:47.60
Definitely, a few good days, a few good days here.

26
00:00:47.60 --> 00:00:50.08
So good evening, Dean.

27
00:00:50.08 --> 00:00:52.08
You know, you fought in a bunch of stuff.

28
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:55.32
Fought in a pride over in Japan, fought in UFC.

29
00:00:55.32 --> 00:00:57.84
And I thought it would be cool to bring you on

30
00:00:57.84 --> 00:01:00.16
because we got some stuff to talk about.

31
00:01:01.84 --> 00:01:03.80
Speaking of the UFC.

32
00:01:03.80 --> 00:01:08.80
So the UFC kind of changed everything for martial arts.

33
00:01:10.80 --> 00:01:13.20
And really, I guess you go back to like Valley Tudo

34
00:01:13.20 --> 00:01:15.64
in Brazil and NHB in Brazil.

35
00:01:16.56 --> 00:01:20.52
But that type of unrestricted fighting,

36
00:01:20.52 --> 00:01:25.52
advanced martial arts in a decade or two,

37
00:01:25.52 --> 00:01:29.08
more than it had advanced,

38
00:01:30.48 --> 00:01:33.000
in a very long time.

39
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.28
But you know, I was thinking about that.

40
00:01:34.28 --> 00:01:35.64
I was thinking about what you just said.

41
00:01:35.64 --> 00:01:37.72
And I actually think that's actually not true a little bit.

42
00:01:37.72 --> 00:01:38.72
And here's why.

43
00:01:38.72 --> 00:01:42.72
I think it actually brought it back to reality.

44
00:01:42.72 --> 00:01:45.64
Because if you went back to ancient Greece

45
00:01:45.64 --> 00:01:48.28
and looked at paint creation, right,

46
00:01:48.28 --> 00:01:51.68
those guys and we have images of people doing paint creation.

47
00:01:51.68 --> 00:01:52.52
Oh, blotters.

48
00:01:52.52 --> 00:01:53.36
And they're doing them a plotters,

49
00:01:53.36 --> 00:01:54.48
they're doing cameras, they're doing,

50
00:01:54.48 --> 00:01:57.48
they're doing heel hooks, they're doing what we do.

51
00:01:57.48 --> 00:01:59.88
And paint creation, if you don't know what it is,

52
00:01:59.88 --> 00:02:01.44
it was in the Olympics.

53
00:02:01.44 --> 00:02:03.08
And I'm talking the old school Olympics.

54
00:02:03.08 --> 00:02:07.32
I'm talking 648 BC is when paint creation

55
00:02:07.32 --> 00:02:08.56
was introduced into the Olympics.

56
00:02:08.56 --> 00:02:11.20
And it was a combination of wrestling, boxing, kicking,

57
00:02:11.20 --> 00:02:12.48
joint locks, chokes.

58
00:02:12.48 --> 00:02:15.80
It was, in other words, an ancient version of MMA.

59
00:02:16.92 --> 00:02:21.92
But over time, over time, things got separated.

60
00:02:21.92 --> 00:02:26.92
The disciplines got separated into boxing over here,

61
00:02:26.92 --> 00:02:28.40
wrestling over here, Muay Thai over here,

62
00:02:28.40 --> 00:02:30.48
Jiu Jitsu over here, Judo over here,

63
00:02:30.48 --> 00:02:33.04
Taekwondo over here, karate over here.

64
00:02:33.04 --> 00:02:35.52
And I was trying to think about why that happened.

65
00:02:36.52 --> 00:02:40.56
And I actually think I have a suspicion, we'll say.

66
00:02:40.56 --> 00:02:41.88
A hypothesis.

67
00:02:41.88 --> 00:02:46.88
My hypothesis is, you know how people generally

68
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.36
only want to do what they're good at?

69
00:02:49.36 --> 00:02:51.24
Like, oh, you're good at,

70
00:02:51.24 --> 00:02:54.20
bench press, what are we doing for a workout today?

71
00:02:54.20 --> 00:02:55.56
We're doing bench press.

72
00:02:55.56 --> 00:02:57.44
Or oh, you're good at squats, what do you wanna do?

73
00:02:57.44 --> 00:02:59.56
Oh, we're gonna do squats.

74
00:02:59.56 --> 00:03:02.68
Oh, you're good at grappling other people.

75
00:03:03.72 --> 00:03:05.84
So you don't want, I don't want, you know,

76
00:03:05.84 --> 00:03:08.12
I'm good at boxing, I don't want Dean Lister grabbing hold

77
00:03:08.12 --> 00:03:09.40
of me and taking me to the ground.

78
00:03:09.40 --> 00:03:11.36
And I don't, so I'm gonna make a different thing.

79
00:03:11.36 --> 00:03:13.000
Something that I'm good at.

80
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.96
And that starts to draw in all the people

81
00:03:14.96 --> 00:03:16.28
that are good at that thing.

82
00:03:17.24 --> 00:03:18.08
Yeah.

83
00:03:18.08 --> 00:03:21.84
And over time, it seems like you just have these

84
00:03:21.84 --> 00:03:22.68
separate things.

85
00:03:22.68 --> 00:03:25.76
Now, whether that's the actual reason, I don't know.

86
00:03:25.76 --> 00:03:30.16
But everything got separated.

87
00:03:30.16 --> 00:03:34.48
And martial arts became siloed, right?

88
00:03:34.48 --> 00:03:36.04
Whereas just different sections.

89
00:03:37.32 --> 00:03:41.48
And then unfortunately,

90
00:03:41.48 --> 00:03:46.44
martial arts became theoretical.

91
00:03:46.44 --> 00:03:50.60
And it didn't take much time for it to go from theory

92
00:03:51.48 --> 00:03:53.12
to lies.

93
00:03:53.12 --> 00:03:57.64
And I know lies is a strong word, but if you go look at,

94
00:03:59.28 --> 00:04:01.40
what's the Instagram?

95
00:04:01.40 --> 00:04:02.24
McDogelLife.

96
00:04:02.24 --> 00:04:05.36
If you go look at McDogel, those are lies.

97
00:04:05.36 --> 00:04:08.20
That dude posts, what's his name?

98
00:04:08.20 --> 00:04:09.60
McDogelLife.

99
00:04:09.60 --> 00:04:10.68
McDogelLife.

100
00:04:10.68 --> 00:04:13.56
So if you go to McDogelLife, you can see people

101
00:04:13.56 --> 00:04:16.88
are teaching lies, actual lies to other people.

102
00:04:17.84 --> 00:04:21.32
And the lies are things like, oh, this one strike.

103
00:04:22.56 --> 00:04:26.48
Or my chi will prevent me from being taken down.

104
00:04:26.48 --> 00:04:29.36
Or I can absorb your strikes with my aura.

105
00:04:29.36 --> 00:04:30.28
Yeah.

106
00:04:30.28 --> 00:04:32.20
Jacques, do you think that's,

107
00:04:32.20 --> 00:04:34.24
you think it's a form of, I don't wanna say,

108
00:04:34.24 --> 00:04:36.96
hypnosis, but what is it you think?

109
00:04:36.96 --> 00:04:38.84
Like that kind of, is it like, oh, everyone else is doing it.

110
00:04:38.84 --> 00:04:40.44
So I guess I'll do it, I'll play along.

111
00:04:40.44 --> 00:04:41.72
Or is it, do they actually?

112
00:04:41.72 --> 00:04:44.60
There's absolutely some kind of psychological,

113
00:04:44.60 --> 00:04:46.96
there's a psychological phenomenon that occurs.

114
00:04:46.96 --> 00:04:48.56
Isn't he making a movie about this?

115
00:04:48.56 --> 00:04:49.40
Yeah.

116
00:04:49.40 --> 00:04:50.24
To explain it.

117
00:04:50.24 --> 00:04:51.36
Yeah, like a bit documentary, yeah.

118
00:04:51.36 --> 00:04:52.96
To explain, and I'm sure there's-

119
00:04:52.96 --> 00:04:54.08
I'll be in that movie.

120
00:04:54.08 --> 00:04:54.92
That's awesome.

121
00:04:54.92 --> 00:04:56.56
You in it too, Echo Charles?

122
00:04:56.56 --> 00:04:57.40
No.

123
00:04:57.40 --> 00:04:58.24
Okay.

124
00:04:58.24 --> 00:05:00.28
So McDogelLife is making a movie about it,

125
00:05:00.28 --> 00:05:04.64
but yeah, there's some kind of psychological manipulation

126
00:05:04.64 --> 00:05:09.64
that happens where, oh, you point your finger at my sternum

127
00:05:09.64 --> 00:05:12.56
and I feel like pain and fall down.

128
00:05:12.56 --> 00:05:15.000
And the reason we know it's a lie is

129
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.48
cause plenty of people have challenged like,

130
00:05:16.48 --> 00:05:18.12
oh, try that on me.

131
00:05:18.12 --> 00:05:18.96
Mother liquor.

132
00:05:18.96 --> 00:05:20.48
Charles, what's the story about you?

133
00:05:20.48 --> 00:05:22.44
You were at, I don't know about the seal base,

134
00:05:22.44 --> 00:05:23.88
but you were there and someone was like, yeah,

135
00:05:23.88 --> 00:05:26.16
you know, you put your finger in the collarbone

136
00:05:26.16 --> 00:05:27.16
and you're like, no.

137
00:05:27.16 --> 00:05:28.24
And he's like, yeah, it works.

138
00:05:28.24 --> 00:05:29.16
And he said, try it on me.

139
00:05:29.16 --> 00:05:31.04
And you double-edit him or something.

140
00:05:31.04 --> 00:05:31.88
What was the story?

141
00:05:31.88 --> 00:05:34.12
No, well, I had a guy saying that,

142
00:05:34.12 --> 00:05:37.08
like they had a name for this like neck strike.

143
00:05:37.08 --> 00:05:40.32
And they were like, oh, if this is done,

144
00:05:40.32 --> 00:05:42.40
like if I did this for real,

145
00:05:42.40 --> 00:05:44.92
you'd immediately be like paralyzed

146
00:05:44.92 --> 00:05:45.80
on the right side of your body

147
00:05:45.80 --> 00:05:47.88
and that would cause you to fall down.

148
00:05:47.88 --> 00:05:49.28
And then that would lead to my next move,

149
00:05:49.28 --> 00:05:50.84
which is like, he'll stop to the collar or whatever.

150
00:05:50.84 --> 00:05:51.88
Right?

151
00:05:51.88 --> 00:05:54.16
And so I was like, cool, do it to me.

152
00:05:55.08 --> 00:05:55.92
He's like, no.

153
00:05:55.92 --> 00:05:56.84
And the guy's like, well, no, it's, you know,

154
00:05:56.84 --> 00:05:59.28
and I was like, do it to me, just do it.

155
00:05:59.28 --> 00:06:01.64
And it didn't, it didn't, obviously it didn't work.

156
00:06:01.64 --> 00:06:03.48
Like a karate chop to the neck.

157
00:06:03.48 --> 00:06:05.24
But didn't you take one, like second one?

158
00:06:05.24 --> 00:06:07.64
And the third one he responded, heard that you were,

159
00:06:07.64 --> 00:06:09.84
you know, I don't even think I retaliated.

160
00:06:09.84 --> 00:06:10.84
The word is that the word that was a thug.

161
00:06:10.84 --> 00:06:13.72
No, Jeff Higgs had a guy that said

162
00:06:13.72 --> 00:06:15.16
that he couldn't be taken down

163
00:06:15.16 --> 00:06:17.04
once he settled his chi.

164
00:06:17.04 --> 00:06:18.04
He could root into the ground.

165
00:06:18.04 --> 00:06:20.16
Yeah, he would root into the ground.

166
00:06:20.16 --> 00:06:21.96
And he, the guy's like,

167
00:06:21.96 --> 00:06:23.32
you would not be able to take me down.

168
00:06:23.32 --> 00:06:25.32
And Higgs is, you know, what do you mean?

169
00:06:25.32 --> 00:06:26.28
And Higgs, if you don't know who he is,

170
00:06:26.28 --> 00:06:27.12
he's been on the podcast.

171
00:06:27.12 --> 00:06:28.52
He's a black belt in jiu-jitsu.

172
00:06:28.52 --> 00:06:32.80
He's a former seal and a good friend of all of ours.

173
00:06:32.80 --> 00:06:35.64
But this guy was saying, oh, you can't take me down

174
00:06:35.64 --> 00:06:36.84
once I settle my chi.

175
00:06:36.84 --> 00:06:39.24
I was, I was, remember that's a good quote, right?

176
00:06:39.24 --> 00:06:40.68
Once I settle my chi.

177
00:06:40.68 --> 00:06:43.16
Cause it sounds like it might be a legitimate thing, right?

178
00:06:43.16 --> 00:06:44.92
Like that's like, you just didn't make that up.

179
00:06:44.92 --> 00:06:47.92
That's, you've told that to other people.

180
00:06:47.92 --> 00:06:49.52
And so Jeff's like, okay, well,

181
00:06:49.52 --> 00:06:52.08
why don't you go ahead and settle that chi?

182
00:06:52.08 --> 00:06:54.32
And the guy goes through his little ceremonial thing

183
00:06:54.32 --> 00:06:58.000
and like, you know, gets in the horse stance.

184
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.52
And Higgs is like, are you ready?

185
00:06:59.52 --> 00:07:00.36
He's like, yeah.

186
00:07:00.36 --> 00:07:01.72
And Jeff just like double legs

187
00:07:01.72 --> 00:07:02.92
and slams it on the ground.

188
00:07:02.92 --> 00:07:04.68
My toes were crossed.

189
00:07:04.68 --> 00:07:05.64
Yeah.

190
00:07:05.64 --> 00:07:06.76
She wasn't settled.

191
00:07:06.76 --> 00:07:08.44
So there is some, when you get to that kind of

192
00:07:08.44 --> 00:07:11.08
McDowjo stuff, there's definitely some psychological

193
00:07:11.08 --> 00:07:12.40
weirdness that's going on.

194
00:07:13.92 --> 00:07:16.92
But those lies were spread.

195
00:07:16.92 --> 00:07:18.64
And you know, whether it was, you can't,

196
00:07:18.64 --> 00:07:22.28
you can't strike through my aura or the dimock,

197
00:07:22.28 --> 00:07:24.000
which is, hey, if I touch you here,

198
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.52
you're going to literally die.

199
00:07:25.52 --> 00:07:27.000
It's right a few days later.

200
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.08
Which also leads to the, hey, I can't actually do this to you

201
00:07:30.08 --> 00:07:33.36
because I don't want to kill you and go to jail for murder.

202
00:07:33.36 --> 00:07:34.72
Okay.

203
00:07:34.72 --> 00:07:36.48
I would do it to you because you're making me mad,

204
00:07:36.48 --> 00:07:37.88
but I don't want to go to jail for murder.

205
00:07:37.88 --> 00:07:41.04
So I'm not going to do this, you know, dimock to you.

206
00:07:41.04 --> 00:07:41.88
Yeah.

207
00:07:41.88 --> 00:07:44.32
And furthermore, you know, the reason you don't see these

208
00:07:44.32 --> 00:07:47.04
moves in competition because they're not allowed.

209
00:07:47.04 --> 00:07:49.36
Jocko, in times as a UFC fighter,

210
00:07:49.36 --> 00:07:50.84
if I had guys come to me and go,

211
00:07:50.84 --> 00:07:53.16
hey, you know, I saw your fight, you're a good fighter.

212
00:07:53.16 --> 00:07:54.48
You know, I'm a street fighter, Joe.

213
00:07:54.48 --> 00:07:55.76
You know, I'm like, okay.

214
00:07:55.76 --> 00:07:58.92
But they had to like qualify that for some reason to me.

215
00:07:58.92 --> 00:08:00.68
I'm like, well, you know, okay, that's cool.

216
00:08:00.68 --> 00:08:03.96
You know, it's just kind of funny that someone thinks

217
00:08:03.96 --> 00:08:06.64
that maybe I've never been in a real life altercation

218
00:08:06.64 --> 00:08:09.80
outside, you know, also like, like I've had my,

219
00:08:09.80 --> 00:08:11.80
that's why I look special in my face.

220
00:08:11.80 --> 00:08:14.20
I've been bit, I've been poked and whatever

221
00:08:14.20 --> 00:08:15.52
and the rest you can imagine.

222
00:08:15.52 --> 00:08:18.32
But it's like, yeah, those things I would call them targets

223
00:08:18.32 --> 00:08:20.000
of opportunity or fighting dirty,

224
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.84
but you can't replicate the eye gouge over and over

225
00:08:22.84 --> 00:08:24.36
or you're going to have everyone's got one eye, you know.

226
00:08:24.36 --> 00:08:25.88
So, so I don't know.

227
00:08:25.88 --> 00:08:28.32
I just think it's funny that people think that

228
00:08:28.32 --> 00:08:30.84
despite all your training, if it's a street fight,

229
00:08:30.84 --> 00:08:31.76
like you have no chance.

230
00:08:31.76 --> 00:08:33.04
I don't know, man, whatever.

231
00:08:33.04 --> 00:08:35.76
If you could do an experiment where you took someone

232
00:08:35.76 --> 00:08:38.64
and just train them in Jiu Jitsu

233
00:08:38.64 --> 00:08:41.000
and they never got in a street fight

234
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.20
and they went against someone that was a street fighter

235
00:08:45.20 --> 00:08:47.16
in the street, it's like it doesn't matter.

236
00:08:49.80 --> 00:08:54.28
Yeah, so the training will transfer now, look,

237
00:08:54.28 --> 00:08:56.48
could you pick up some bad habits

238
00:08:56.48 --> 00:08:58.04
where you do something in the street

239
00:08:58.04 --> 00:09:01.68
that now it takes you an extra two seconds to win

240
00:09:01.68 --> 00:09:04.000
because you should have done this specific thing

241
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.56
because yeah, you could do that.

242
00:09:05.56 --> 00:09:10.04
But that's like the tiniest percentage.

243
00:09:10.04 --> 00:09:12.08
If there's someone that's like, that's why I don't train,

244
00:09:12.08 --> 00:09:14.60
you know, because I'm ready for the street.

245
00:09:18.08 --> 00:09:20.20
But going back to the storyline a little bit,

246
00:09:20.20 --> 00:09:22.82
these lies, which still exist today,

247
00:09:24.40 --> 00:09:27.16
in the 70s and 80s, these lies were just kind of like

248
00:09:27.16 --> 00:09:31.12
out of control and they definitely got picked up

249
00:09:31.12 --> 00:09:32.16
in the military.

250
00:09:33.76 --> 00:09:35.60
I was looking through some old army,

251
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:38.92
I looked through an old army hand-to-hand manual from 1982.

252
00:09:38.92 --> 00:09:41.12
So this is like in the heyday of Chi.

253
00:09:42.64 --> 00:09:46.60
And it said this in this manual, no judo.

254
00:09:46.60 --> 00:09:48.36
You have probably already asked yourself,

255
00:09:48.36 --> 00:09:51.96
what about throwing and takedowns like in judo?

256
00:09:51.96 --> 00:09:55.44
We have purposely excluded throws and takedowns

257
00:09:55.44 --> 00:09:58.20
because throws and takedowns are normally only

258
00:09:58.20 --> 00:10:01.24
an intermediate step to taking your opponent out.

259
00:10:02.28 --> 00:10:04.12
After your opponent is thrown to the ground,

260
00:10:04.12 --> 00:10:06.96
you will probably still have to strike him to finish him.

261
00:10:06.96 --> 00:10:09.20
So let's just block his attack and finish him

262
00:10:09.20 --> 00:10:11.24
with counter strikes instead of blocking,

263
00:10:11.24 --> 00:10:13.12
throwing, then striking.

264
00:10:14.68 --> 00:10:18.40
It's like, that actually makes you think,

265
00:10:18.40 --> 00:10:20.08
well, you know, it's a good point.

266
00:10:20.08 --> 00:10:21.76
You know, that's a good point.

267
00:10:21.76 --> 00:10:23.24
You know, I'm not gonna, I don't wanna have to take someone

268
00:10:23.24 --> 00:10:25.56
down, I'll just take them out.

269
00:10:26.68 --> 00:10:28.16
This thing goes on to say that throwing

270
00:10:28.16 --> 00:10:29.60
puts you in a vulnerable position.

271
00:10:29.60 --> 00:10:31.72
To throw your opponent, you must first grab him.

272
00:10:31.72 --> 00:10:33.16
This puts you close to your opponent

273
00:10:33.16 --> 00:10:34.88
and vulnerable to his attack.

274
00:10:34.88 --> 00:10:36.40
Certain throws, yeah, certain throws.

275
00:10:36.40 --> 00:10:38.000
Oh, for sure.

276
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Well, theoretical, again, that's the problem

277
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.44
with this stuff is theoretically,

278
00:10:42.44 --> 00:10:44.64
especially if I say, listen, Dean,

279
00:10:44.64 --> 00:10:48.64
if I, you know, double knuckle punch your sternum,

280
00:10:48.64 --> 00:10:50.84
it's gonna cause you to have a cardiac arrest.

281
00:10:50.84 --> 00:10:52.64
So why am I gonna bother throwing you

282
00:10:52.64 --> 00:10:55.36
and I can just give you a literal heart attack?

283
00:10:55.36 --> 00:10:58.16
And you, and if you said, well, why don't you show me that?

284
00:10:58.16 --> 00:11:00.40
I'd be like, cause I don't wanna kill you, bro.

285
00:11:00.40 --> 00:11:02.12
You just have to, but trust me.

286
00:11:04.16 --> 00:11:08.12
So, actually what's interesting is in that book

287
00:11:08.12 --> 00:11:10.80
that Fieldman, who I was looking at,

288
00:11:11.80 --> 00:11:12.76
you know, I'm looking at the rest of it

289
00:11:12.76 --> 00:11:17.000
and it has all these like, their foot patterns

290
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.08
and it looks like these dance moves to like avoid

291
00:11:20.08 --> 00:11:22.12
and like strengthen your power.

292
00:11:22.12 --> 00:11:24.08
And it's just a bunch of nonsense,

293
00:11:24.08 --> 00:11:25.20
to be honest with you.

294
00:11:25.20 --> 00:11:27.80
But like I just said, if this stuff is getting taught

295
00:11:27.80 --> 00:11:30.52
by some authoritarian figure

296
00:11:30.52 --> 00:11:33.20
and you can't really test it in any way,

297
00:11:34.72 --> 00:11:37.52
and you know, this is someone that's a, you know,

298
00:11:37.52 --> 00:11:42.16
a 38 year old who's talking to an 18 year old recruit

299
00:11:42.16 --> 00:11:44.80
that kind of wants to believe, by the way.

300
00:11:44.80 --> 00:11:45.88
Cause most people are like,

301
00:11:45.88 --> 00:11:47.000
oh, you're giving me a special power,

302
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.44
I'm gonna take it.

303
00:11:48.44 --> 00:11:49.88
I'm not gonna question you.

304
00:11:49.88 --> 00:11:52.04
And that's probably what leads to some of the

305
00:11:52.04 --> 00:11:54.68
weird McDow-Joe life type scenarios.

306
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.56
So this, to me, this is like the low point

307
00:12:01.56 --> 00:12:04.32
of martial arts in history, in my opinion.

308
00:12:04.32 --> 00:12:06.04
This is the 1970s, the 1980s.

309
00:12:06.04 --> 00:12:06.88
And look, I get it.

310
00:12:06.88 --> 00:12:08.28
Some guys were doing the best they could

311
00:12:08.28 --> 00:12:11.52
with what was available and good on them.

312
00:12:11.52 --> 00:12:13.40
I know some of those guys.

313
00:12:13.40 --> 00:12:14.24
Remember Dr. Mick?

314
00:12:14.24 --> 00:12:15.08
Dr. Mick was one of those guys.

315
00:12:15.08 --> 00:12:16.08
And he had a whole crew of guys.

316
00:12:16.08 --> 00:12:18.44
Like in the 70s, they did everything they could

317
00:12:18.44 --> 00:12:21.16
to the extent that they could do it.

318
00:12:21.16 --> 00:12:22.92
And there was also some guys that were awesome back then.

319
00:12:22.92 --> 00:12:24.08
Judo Jean LaBelle.

320
00:12:25.20 --> 00:12:30.20
Like no one can question the effectiveness

321
00:12:30.28 --> 00:12:32.12
and the efficiency and the awesomeness

322
00:12:32.12 --> 00:12:35.44
of Judo Jean LaBelle, 50, 60, 70s.

323
00:12:36.80 --> 00:12:39.96
But as a whole, if you look at commercially,

324
00:12:41.40 --> 00:12:44.72
that time period was pretty rough for martial arts.

325
00:12:44.72 --> 00:12:46.12
And then the UFC came.

326
00:12:47.36 --> 00:12:49.44
And the UFC brought the truth.

327
00:12:49.44 --> 00:12:54.20
And with that, everything changed for the better.

328
00:12:54.20 --> 00:12:55.84
I'm taking notes by the way.

329
00:12:55.84 --> 00:12:56.84
This is good stuff.

330
00:12:57.80 --> 00:13:00.16
Everything changed for the better.

331
00:13:00.16 --> 00:13:01.36
What's your notes?

332
00:13:01.36 --> 00:13:02.44
Do you have any so far?

333
00:13:02.44 --> 00:13:03.56
Well, I wrote a few things down.

334
00:13:03.56 --> 00:13:05.04
I just think we'll get into this,

335
00:13:05.04 --> 00:13:07.84
but it's old saying and I'll butcher it probably,

336
00:13:07.84 --> 00:13:09.12
but oh, there we go.

337
00:13:10.12 --> 00:13:14.36
Something like hard work achieved without payment

338
00:13:14.36 --> 00:13:17.44
or without sacrifice is something you shouldn't trust.

339
00:13:17.44 --> 00:13:20.60
So the quick way to get this quick knockout

340
00:13:20.60 --> 00:13:22.04
without learning how to box,

341
00:13:22.04 --> 00:13:24.32
or the quick way to get the flying submission

342
00:13:24.32 --> 00:13:26.28
or the stimulus to go on that break

343
00:13:26.28 --> 00:13:28.40
without learning to grapple,

344
00:13:28.40 --> 00:13:31.08
it seems good, but it doesn't work.

345
00:13:31.08 --> 00:13:33.36
Trying to get in shape without working out.

346
00:13:34.56 --> 00:13:37.24
You just get implants in your biceps like you.

347
00:13:37.24 --> 00:13:38.08
Sure.

348
00:13:38.08 --> 00:13:39.48
You have bicep implants.

349
00:13:39.48 --> 00:13:41.92
Those arms don't work exactly.

350
00:13:41.92 --> 00:13:44.28
Sorry, I won't say it on the internet.

351
00:13:45.20 --> 00:13:46.36
That's private.

352
00:13:46.36 --> 00:13:49.40
But these kind of things, these shortcuts,

353
00:13:49.40 --> 00:13:51.32
become a millionaire tomorrow

354
00:13:51.32 --> 00:13:53.20
without even having a business plan.

355
00:13:53.20 --> 00:13:55.08
I'm saying that's an interesting idea.

356
00:13:55.08 --> 00:13:56.92
So it sounds good.

357
00:13:56.92 --> 00:13:58.76
And I think if someone trained a lot in boxing,

358
00:13:58.76 --> 00:14:00.32
kickboxing and wrestling,

359
00:14:00.32 --> 00:14:01.56
you could do that stuff

360
00:14:01.56 --> 00:14:03.84
if you train in all these disciplines.

361
00:14:03.84 --> 00:14:05.04
I think it's interesting.

362
00:14:05.04 --> 00:14:07.68
That is something that I think it's imperative

363
00:14:07.68 --> 00:14:08.84
to get into.

364
00:14:09.88 --> 00:14:11.44
I asked you this, Jaco.

365
00:14:11.44 --> 00:14:13.08
It relates to what we're talking about right now.

366
00:14:13.08 --> 00:14:17.52
I had a Zoom call with like 12 Marine officers.

367
00:14:17.52 --> 00:14:19.20
They called me, it was a colonel.

368
00:14:19.20 --> 00:14:21.40
They called me their, I don't know,

369
00:14:21.40 --> 00:14:22.60
captains and lieutenants.

370
00:14:22.60 --> 00:14:23.60
And they were talking about,

371
00:14:23.60 --> 00:14:24.44
because they had fought,

372
00:14:24.44 --> 00:14:26.60
I guess they saw me compete in Brazil,

373
00:14:26.60 --> 00:14:29.88
talking about my training patterns and whatever.

374
00:14:29.88 --> 00:14:30.72
And they were saying,

375
00:14:30.72 --> 00:14:32.04
how it can relate to the military.

376
00:14:32.04 --> 00:14:33.68
And I said, well,

377
00:14:33.68 --> 00:14:34.60
and this is something I know,

378
00:14:34.60 --> 00:14:36.76
it's stepping out a little out of my realm,

379
00:14:36.76 --> 00:14:38.20
but I mentioned something,

380
00:14:38.20 --> 00:14:40.32
simulation training, of course, you talk about that.

381
00:14:40.32 --> 00:14:41.52
And that's not combat,

382
00:14:41.52 --> 00:14:42.88
but that's closer to combat

383
00:14:42.88 --> 00:14:44.56
than bang, bang, bang, you know?

384
00:14:44.56 --> 00:14:46.08
And I know the argument,

385
00:14:46.08 --> 00:14:47.64
they don't go through walls and are as realistic,

386
00:14:47.64 --> 00:14:50.36
but you get a sting, you got hit.

387
00:14:50.36 --> 00:14:51.28
And they were like, no, there's,

388
00:14:51.28 --> 00:14:54.04
yeah, that's closer to a gun battle

389
00:14:54.04 --> 00:14:56.16
than laser tag or something like that.

390
00:14:56.16 --> 00:14:58.76
What's the old system that would beat?

391
00:14:58.76 --> 00:15:00.60
Yeah, there's an old system called Miles Gear,

392
00:15:00.60 --> 00:15:01.56
which is a laser tag system.

393
00:15:01.56 --> 00:15:03.24
And they have more advanced laser systems,

394
00:15:03.24 --> 00:15:05.64
which are actually really good now.

395
00:15:05.64 --> 00:15:07.28
And yes, that's a very,

396
00:15:07.28 --> 00:15:08.60
those are great training tools.

397
00:15:08.60 --> 00:15:11.16
And sure, are there some little things

398
00:15:11.16 --> 00:15:14.16
about using those systems that are not accurate?

399
00:15:14.16 --> 00:15:17.20
Yes, but just as you said, it's closer.

400
00:15:17.20 --> 00:15:18.96
So if you're getting ready for,

401
00:15:18.96 --> 00:15:20.64
I don't even know life in that situation,

402
00:15:20.64 --> 00:15:23.68
I would rather trust the person who has trained 10 years

403
00:15:23.68 --> 00:15:27.24
in a struggle where they've dealt with adversity,

404
00:15:27.24 --> 00:15:30.000
they've been in panic situations in Minkom,

405
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.96
versus someone who, I don't know,

406
00:15:33.28 --> 00:15:35.40
let's say is open to more dirty things,

407
00:15:35.40 --> 00:15:37.12
but it's never practiced it in real life.

408
00:15:37.12 --> 00:15:38.72
Then again, if someone has actually been through life

409
00:15:38.72 --> 00:15:41.56
in that situation and used it, that's good, I guess.

410
00:15:41.56 --> 00:15:44.44
But I think it's important to find that training medium.

411
00:15:44.44 --> 00:15:47.68
So gloves, in fact, I guess I should wear my gloves

412
00:15:47.68 --> 00:15:51.32
when I train, but if you don't wear gloves,

413
00:15:51.32 --> 00:15:54.60
your hands get stronger, but you can also hurt your hands.

414
00:15:55.76 --> 00:15:57.04
So gloves have a place, but then again,

415
00:15:57.04 --> 00:15:58.56
you can't rely upon big gloves in boxing.

416
00:15:58.56 --> 00:16:02.40
You have no gloves and you can't cover up the same.

417
00:16:02.40 --> 00:16:05.20
So I think it's important to find the happy balance,

418
00:16:05.20 --> 00:16:07.60
that medium between hard training and realism.

419
00:16:07.60 --> 00:16:11.80
Yeah, and that's what the UFC did,

420
00:16:11.80 --> 00:16:13.48
and really Jiu Jitsu is a huge part of this,

421
00:16:13.48 --> 00:16:15.36
is you can train full speed, right?

422
00:16:15.36 --> 00:16:19.40
You can go hard, and look, you can spar in boxing,

423
00:16:19.40 --> 00:16:22.48
and you can, in wrestling, you're going live

424
00:16:22.48 --> 00:16:24.96
against other people, but when you take that

425
00:16:24.96 --> 00:16:26.32
and put it together into martial art,

426
00:16:26.32 --> 00:16:29.20
Jiu Jitsu was like bringing that forward,

427
00:16:29.20 --> 00:16:31.24
and boxing did it, wrestling did it,

428
00:16:31.24 --> 00:16:33.28
Jiu Jitsu does it, Muay Thai does it,

429
00:16:33.28 --> 00:16:36.12
but who didn't do it was like Dim Mock,

430
00:16:36.12 --> 00:16:40.80
and the old kind of weird traditional martial arts

431
00:16:40.80 --> 00:16:45.60
that didn't actually do anything, except for theory.

432
00:16:45.60 --> 00:16:50.60
So as the UFC happened, we started to see this

433
00:16:50.92 --> 00:16:53.24
in the military, and people in the military

434
00:16:53.24 --> 00:16:54.84
started learning and testing,

435
00:16:54.84 --> 00:16:59.84
and started to move the military combatives

436
00:17:00.20 --> 00:17:01.44
to a much better place.

437
00:17:01.44 --> 00:17:03.68
And one of the leaders in this, the guy named Matt Larson,

438
00:17:03.68 --> 00:17:07.96
I don't actually know him, but everybody kind of knows him.

439
00:17:07.96 --> 00:17:10.20
He's a former Marine, former Army Ranger,

440
00:17:10.20 --> 00:17:13.56
and he's, I think he's pretty much known

441
00:17:13.56 --> 00:17:16.96
as the father of modern army combatives.

442
00:17:16.96 --> 00:17:20.40
He's the one that started to train and formalize,

443
00:17:20.40 --> 00:17:22.72
and kind of push this well-rounded approach,

444
00:17:23.72 --> 00:17:28.40
realistic approach to hand-to-hand combat,

445
00:17:28.40 --> 00:17:31.20
and eventually his work, and look,

446
00:17:31.20 --> 00:17:32.80
I'm giving one person all the credit right now,

447
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:35.04
I'm sure he would talk about all the people

448
00:17:35.04 --> 00:17:35.88
that helped him get there,

449
00:17:35.88 --> 00:17:39.44
but this is the person that I know of that was involved,

450
00:17:39.44 --> 00:17:41.56
and like I said, I'm sure there's many more people,

451
00:17:41.56 --> 00:17:44.96
but he certainly was a spearhead on this,

452
00:17:44.96 --> 00:17:49.60
and his work, and whoever he was working with at the time,

453
00:17:49.60 --> 00:17:53.28
eventually became an Army Field Manual,

454
00:17:53.28 --> 00:17:58.28
an Army Field Manual, three-tact 25.150 combatives.

455
00:17:58.28 --> 00:18:03.28
And I thought today maybe we could take a look at this manual,

456
00:18:03.28 --> 00:18:04.76
go through some of the highlights,

457
00:18:04.76 --> 00:18:06.16
discuss how it can be applied,

458
00:18:06.16 --> 00:18:09.44
and not only can it be applied to how we fight, of course,

459
00:18:09.44 --> 00:18:13.64
but also how we train and how we live.

460
00:18:13.64 --> 00:18:16.88
So there you go, let's take a look at this manual,

461
00:18:16.88 --> 00:18:21.20
combatives, picture of a dude with a freaking K-bar

462
00:18:21.20 --> 00:18:23.16
on the cover, gotta love that.

463
00:18:23.16 --> 00:18:24.28
Here's the overview.

464
00:18:24.28 --> 00:18:27.68
The overview to kick this thing off,

465
00:18:27.68 --> 00:18:30.88
it says combatives training stands apart

466
00:18:30.88 --> 00:18:32.96
from the vast majority of martial arts training

467
00:18:32.96 --> 00:18:36.68
in that producing the individual's actual fighting ability

468
00:18:36.68 --> 00:18:39.24
is of primary concern.

469
00:18:39.24 --> 00:18:41.20
The mental and physical benefits of training

470
00:18:41.20 --> 00:18:43.36
gain their worth from usefulness

471
00:18:43.36 --> 00:18:45.36
in producing more capable soldiers.

472
00:18:45.36 --> 00:18:50.36
Now, I'm not 100% sure I agree with that opening statement,

473
00:18:50.64 --> 00:18:53.88
only because it says, you know, combatives training,

474
00:18:53.88 --> 00:18:57.12
the main thing about combatives training

475
00:18:57.12 --> 00:18:58.48
is that you're trying to improve

476
00:18:58.48 --> 00:19:00.60
the fighting ability of the person.

477
00:19:00.60 --> 00:19:03.32
Doesn't all Jiu-Jitsu and boxing and Muay Thai

478
00:19:03.32 --> 00:19:04.68
trying to make you a better fighter?

479
00:19:04.68 --> 00:19:07.28
I must be misreading that or something,

480
00:19:07.28 --> 00:19:10.28
but that's what we're trying to do,

481
00:19:10.28 --> 00:19:12.72
is make someone a better fighter.

482
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.96
I guess I'll go with it.

483
00:19:15.96 --> 00:19:19.08
Purpose, combatives, the art of hand-to-hand combat

484
00:19:19.08 --> 00:19:22.04
bridges the gap between physical training and tactics.

485
00:19:22.04 --> 00:19:24.16
The products of a good physical training plan,

486
00:19:24.16 --> 00:19:25.64
strength, endurance, and flexibility

487
00:19:25.64 --> 00:19:27.04
must be directed toward the mission,

488
00:19:27.04 --> 00:19:28.68
and soldiers must be prepared to use

489
00:19:28.68 --> 00:19:30.80
different levels of force in an environment

490
00:19:30.80 --> 00:19:33.36
where the intensity of a conflict changes quickly.

491
00:19:33.36 --> 00:19:36.32
Many military operations, such as peacekeeping missions

492
00:19:36.32 --> 00:19:38.12
or non-combatant evacuation,

493
00:19:38.12 --> 00:19:41.12
may restrict the use of lethal force.

494
00:19:41.12 --> 00:19:43.96
Combatives training prepares the soldier

495
00:19:43.96 --> 00:19:48.44
to use the appropriate amount of force for any situation.

496
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:51.76
Okay, so that's always good.

497
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:53.36
And you know, sometimes people ask me,

498
00:19:53.36 --> 00:19:54.80
have you ever used hand-to-hand?

499
00:19:54.80 --> 00:19:57.92
And they actually think my answer's gonna be no.

500
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:01.40
And they think that most people would never use hand-to-hand,

501
00:20:01.40 --> 00:20:04.08
but it actually is very common to use

502
00:20:05.40 --> 00:20:07.84
combatives techniques in combat.

503
00:20:07.84 --> 00:20:08.68
Why?

504
00:20:08.68 --> 00:20:10.16
Because you're dealing with civilians,

505
00:20:10.16 --> 00:20:12.000
you're dealing with unarmed people,

506
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.12
and you can't just run around shooting everybody

507
00:20:14.12 --> 00:20:16.28
in a semi-permissive environment,

508
00:20:16.28 --> 00:20:17.76
or even in a wartime environment,

509
00:20:17.76 --> 00:20:21.60
you see someone that's not armed or you enter a building,

510
00:20:21.60 --> 00:20:24.32
just there's a male, a female, a kid

511
00:20:24.32 --> 00:20:27.40
that doesn't have a weapon, you have to contend with them.

512
00:20:28.56 --> 00:20:33.56
So combatives are very important to have as a skill set,

513
00:20:33.68 --> 00:20:36.96
to handle, you know, actually when the enemy has a gun,

514
00:20:36.96 --> 00:20:38.24
it makes everything easier.

515
00:20:38.24 --> 00:20:41.76
You kill them, you shoot them, done deal, no factor.

516
00:20:44.56 --> 00:20:46.24
Would you write down, D?

517
00:20:46.24 --> 00:20:47.72
A couple of things about the origin of martial arts

518
00:20:47.72 --> 00:20:50.12
and how some things have shaped regionally.

519
00:20:50.12 --> 00:20:53.60
Like, this is a little before, but also,

520
00:20:53.60 --> 00:20:56.12
I was in Mitch One D, I saw someone

521
00:20:56.12 --> 00:20:58.44
from one military service of one country.

522
00:20:59.56 --> 00:21:00.92
I wanted to know, we'll get too specific,

523
00:21:00.92 --> 00:21:02.32
but I saw the person teaching.

524
00:21:03.32 --> 00:21:06.000
His knuckles right here on his hand,

525
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.52
like he has a boxer with big gloves.

526
00:21:07.52 --> 00:21:08.96
If you do that with no gloves,

527
00:21:08.96 --> 00:21:11.04
your own hand will cut your face.

528
00:21:11.04 --> 00:21:11.88
Yep.

529
00:21:11.88 --> 00:21:13.60
So things like that, they're teaching the recruits,

530
00:21:13.60 --> 00:21:15.96
I'm talking to like 200 people in the class,

531
00:21:15.96 --> 00:21:18.12
it was one of our services, I won't say which one,

532
00:21:18.12 --> 00:21:19.48
and teaching people to hold it like this,

533
00:21:19.48 --> 00:21:21.92
I'm saying, well, even in boxing, I wouldn't do that,

534
00:21:21.92 --> 00:21:23.20
but with big gloves, it makes for a sense,

535
00:21:23.20 --> 00:21:24.84
you can see over that right there,

536
00:21:24.84 --> 00:21:26.24
is someone who actually has never been punched

537
00:21:26.24 --> 00:21:29.000
in the face without gloves on.

538
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.60
Teaching that to 200 people at a time,

539
00:21:30.60 --> 00:21:32.16
I'm like, I didn't correct them.

540
00:21:32.16 --> 00:21:34.52
I would, but you know, he's having them like this,

541
00:21:34.52 --> 00:21:35.96
I'm like, you know, at least want to be here,

542
00:21:35.96 --> 00:21:38.68
or maybe, it's just interesting that that person

543
00:21:38.68 --> 00:21:41.52
teaching people how to punch with no gloves on,

544
00:21:41.52 --> 00:21:43.000
probably has never punched in the face.

545
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.72
And he may be a skilled boxer.

546
00:21:44.72 --> 00:21:46.20
Yep, absolutely, yeah, probably.

547
00:21:46.20 --> 00:21:49.08
He's probably, may have been punched in the head,

548
00:21:49.08 --> 00:21:51.60
you know, while he had his cover up,

549
00:21:51.60 --> 00:21:53.28
and you can realize you can absorb,

550
00:21:53.28 --> 00:21:56.80
you've got their big glove versus going into your big glove,

551
00:21:56.80 --> 00:21:58.28
and it absorbs.

552
00:21:58.28 --> 00:22:00.28
You take those big gloves off,

553
00:22:00.28 --> 00:22:02.08
you punch right through that person's hand.

554
00:22:02.08 --> 00:22:04.36
So that is a little bit, we're looking at a sport boxing,

555
00:22:04.36 --> 00:22:05.64
which is great, I love boxing,

556
00:22:05.64 --> 00:22:08.28
but if you do not alter that part,

557
00:22:08.28 --> 00:22:09.52
by the way, not every boxer does this,

558
00:22:09.52 --> 00:22:11.60
I'm saying this person, some boxer's in the corner,

559
00:22:11.60 --> 00:22:14.32
you cover him like this, if you don't alter that rule,

560
00:22:14.32 --> 00:22:16.12
that would actually cause you to get a lot of damage

561
00:22:16.12 --> 00:22:18.28
in a fight, because this also,

562
00:22:18.28 --> 00:22:20.96
you don't cover much of your face with these little hands,

563
00:22:20.96 --> 00:22:22.92
the same, but without gloves.

564
00:22:22.92 --> 00:22:24.68
So that's the example, I was just trying to say how

565
00:22:24.68 --> 00:22:26.12
we're looking for the happy medium,

566
00:22:26.12 --> 00:22:27.48
because we're dealing with the military,

567
00:22:27.48 --> 00:22:29.72
not boxing and not wrestling.

568
00:22:29.72 --> 00:22:31.60
It's actually a military application.

569
00:22:31.60 --> 00:22:33.32
Yep.

570
00:22:33.32 --> 00:22:34.32
It goes on to say here,

571
00:22:34.32 --> 00:22:36.68
combatives training includes arduous physical training

572
00:22:36.68 --> 00:22:38.64
that is mentally demanding and carries over

573
00:22:38.64 --> 00:22:39.88
to other military pursuits.

574
00:22:39.88 --> 00:22:41.96
This training produces soldiers who

575
00:22:42.96 --> 00:22:45.52
understand controlled aggression and remain focused

576
00:22:45.52 --> 00:22:47.16
while under duress.

577
00:22:47.16 --> 00:22:48.000
That's awesome.

578
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.84
That's true.

579
00:22:48.84 --> 00:22:50.96
Right, so when you get good at fighting,

580
00:22:50.96 --> 00:22:54.04
it's gonna help you stay calm in other situations.

581
00:22:54.04 --> 00:22:56.80
That's an awesome aspect of training.

582
00:22:58.40 --> 00:23:02.20
You process the skills requisite to the mission

583
00:23:02.20 --> 00:23:04.72
at levels in all the spectrum,

584
00:23:04.72 --> 00:23:07.72
in all the levels of spectrum of force.

585
00:23:07.72 --> 00:23:10.32
So you're gonna learn how to control different scenarios.

586
00:23:10.32 --> 00:23:12.88
Have attributes that make up the warrior ethos,

587
00:23:12.88 --> 00:23:14.28
personal courage, self confidence,

588
00:23:14.28 --> 00:23:16.76
self discipline and a spree to core.

589
00:23:16.76 --> 00:23:18.40
That's huge.

590
00:23:18.40 --> 00:23:22.12
It's so good for people to know how to fight.

591
00:23:22.12 --> 00:23:24.76
It's just so good for people to know how to fight.

592
00:23:24.76 --> 00:23:27.40
You actually, when you know how to fight,

593
00:23:27.40 --> 00:23:28.92
you become less arrogant.

594
00:23:28.92 --> 00:23:29.76
Yeah, yeah.

595
00:23:29.76 --> 00:23:32.48
You might be, if you're 20 years old,

596
00:23:32.48 --> 00:23:34.92
you might have a spike in your arrogance, right?

597
00:23:34.92 --> 00:23:36.92
Echo Chaw's, you're smiling at that one.

598
00:23:36.92 --> 00:23:39.16
Yeah, there are exceptions, we'll just say that.

599
00:23:39.16 --> 00:23:41.56
Yeah, where you get a little spike in your arrogance,

600
00:23:41.56 --> 00:23:44.52
but over time, you'll realize, okay,

601
00:23:44.52 --> 00:23:46.64
the reason I'm good is because I trained more

602
00:23:46.64 --> 00:23:48.000
and guess what, there's someone that's trained more

603
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.20
than me and that's the way it is.

604
00:23:49.20 --> 00:23:53.52
So generally speaking, it'll help yourself confidence

605
00:23:53.52 --> 00:23:54.40
while at the same time,

606
00:23:54.40 --> 00:23:56.80
preventing you from becoming arrogant.

607
00:23:56.80 --> 00:23:57.76
Yeah, you gotta beat up so much,

608
00:23:57.76 --> 00:23:58.84
you have to be calm, you know.

609
00:23:58.84 --> 00:24:01.52
I mean, it's humbling, man.

610
00:24:01.52 --> 00:24:02.36
It's humbling.

611
00:24:02.36 --> 00:24:04.84
You remember the first time you tapped me out

612
00:24:04.84 --> 00:24:07.08
a hundred times in the gym when I first showed up?

613
00:24:07.08 --> 00:24:10.48
I was a young seal rolling in there,

614
00:24:10.48 --> 00:24:14.000
thinking I knew how to fight, didn't know Jack.

615
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.80
If Jack would, when he would tap you, he would just tap.

616
00:24:16.80 --> 00:24:17.64
Like, don't.

617
00:24:17.64 --> 00:24:18.48
Like, don't.

618
00:24:18.48 --> 00:24:23.48
No expression on the face, just, let's train again.

619
00:24:23.48 --> 00:24:24.32
Yeah.

620
00:24:24.32 --> 00:24:25.16
Yeah.

621
00:24:27.04 --> 00:24:29.64
So it's humbling, especially, what were you,

622
00:24:29.64 --> 00:24:31.32
17 or 18 when we started training?

623
00:24:31.32 --> 00:24:32.16
19 years old.

624
00:24:32.16 --> 00:24:34.12
19 years old, you were 170 pounds.

625
00:24:34.12 --> 00:24:34.96
Yeah.

626
00:24:34.96 --> 00:24:36.40
And I was like 220.

627
00:24:36.40 --> 00:24:38.36
I was a grown man, you were a kid.

628
00:24:38.36 --> 00:24:44.20
And I'm like, this poor guy, I'm gonna smash his little head.

629
00:24:44.20 --> 00:24:45.04
Yeah.

630
00:24:47.04 --> 00:24:48.12
Throughout modern history,

631
00:24:48.12 --> 00:24:51.24
attempts to build successful combative systems have failed

632
00:24:51.24 --> 00:24:53.28
or have been met with limited success.

633
00:24:53.28 --> 00:24:54.52
This has happened for several reasons.

634
00:24:54.52 --> 00:24:56.20
Quite naturally, commanders desire a system

635
00:24:56.20 --> 00:24:59.96
that doesn't require any training time to learn and maintain.

636
00:24:59.96 --> 00:25:01.40
So that's a real problem out of the gate.

637
00:25:01.40 --> 00:25:04.04
People think, well, you know, I saw a thing

638
00:25:04.04 --> 00:25:06.24
where you can just learn four deadly moves

639
00:25:06.24 --> 00:25:07.08
and you're gonna be good to go.

640
00:25:07.08 --> 00:25:07.92
Why don't we just use that, bro?

641
00:25:07.92 --> 00:25:09.08
That's what I'm talking about, exactly.

642
00:25:09.08 --> 00:25:11.32
Four deadly moves to end any street fight.

643
00:25:12.24 --> 00:25:13.96
The commander's like, hey, I think what you just learned,

644
00:25:13.96 --> 00:25:15.44
I saw those four deadly moves,

645
00:25:15.44 --> 00:25:16.48
why don't we just focus on those?

646
00:25:16.48 --> 00:25:18.60
That way you're gonna have to spend a bunch of time.

647
00:25:18.60 --> 00:25:20.72
He's a guy, he actually has, it's like a,

648
00:25:20.72 --> 00:25:22.56
it's tagged in like YouTube,

649
00:25:22.56 --> 00:25:25.60
so it's like X Army Ranger,

650
00:25:25.60 --> 00:25:27.96
plus 10 years of bouncing experience,

651
00:25:27.96 --> 00:25:29.72
is one over 500 bar fights,

652
00:25:29.72 --> 00:25:32.28
never been hit in the face once by a system.

653
00:25:32.28 --> 00:25:34.000
I'm just like, I'm not gonna check it out,

654
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.52
just win every fight in three, four seconds, just whatever.

655
00:25:37.52 --> 00:25:38.80
Now there's ways to surprise people,

656
00:25:38.80 --> 00:25:40.04
there's ways to look over there

657
00:25:40.04 --> 00:25:41.96
and hit someone, there's ways to have your friend.

658
00:25:41.96 --> 00:25:43.84
I mean, there's all kinds of tricks,

659
00:25:43.84 --> 00:25:45.44
to trick, you can trick someone out in public,

660
00:25:45.44 --> 00:25:50.20
but I don't know, just funny how this get strong,

661
00:25:50.20 --> 00:25:52.40
quick, with no sacrifice game,

662
00:25:52.40 --> 00:25:54.32
or get rich quick, that's what I was saying earlier.

663
00:25:54.32 --> 00:25:57.24
I don't know, it's kind of like, not the future.

664
00:25:57.24 --> 00:25:58.84
Yep.

665
00:25:58.84 --> 00:26:01.44
Yep, it's gonna take some time.

666
00:26:01.44 --> 00:26:03.88
Continuing on, further training has often been conducted

667
00:26:03.88 --> 00:26:05.88
by experts in civilian martial arts.

668
00:26:05.88 --> 00:26:07.68
These experts use training methodologies

669
00:26:07.68 --> 00:26:09.36
that are designed for more civilian hobbyists

670
00:26:09.36 --> 00:26:10.36
than in realities of war.

671
00:26:10.36 --> 00:26:11.56
That's exactly what you were just talking about

672
00:26:11.56 --> 00:26:13.000
with the boxing gloves, right?

673
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.08
Oh, I'm a great boxer, I'll teach you how to box, cool.

674
00:26:15.08 --> 00:26:16.76
But I'm not wearing gloves, now I'm breaking my hand,

675
00:26:16.76 --> 00:26:17.80
now I'm getting punched in the face

676
00:26:17.80 --> 00:26:18.88
when I thought I was covered up,

677
00:26:18.88 --> 00:26:20.60
it's like, there's the issues.

678
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.32
Often, combatives training has been approached

679
00:26:25.32 --> 00:26:27.80
by allowing a soldier versed in a civilian martial art

680
00:26:27.80 --> 00:26:30.000
to use a limited amount of training time,

681
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
usually during another course,

682
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.48
to teach a useful technique.

683
00:26:33.48 --> 00:26:35.16
Blinded by their civilian training,

684
00:26:35.16 --> 00:26:37.04
the trainer demonstrates what the trainer thinks

685
00:26:37.04 --> 00:26:39.04
are simple, effective, and easy to learn techniques,

686
00:26:39.04 --> 00:26:42.80
selected based on situations soldiers may find themselves

687
00:26:42.80 --> 00:26:45.24
or in a tactical niche of the specialist training.

688
00:26:45.24 --> 00:26:47.52
The trainer teaches the soldiers these techniques,

689
00:26:47.52 --> 00:26:49.08
but due to the limited amount of training time,

690
00:26:49.08 --> 00:26:50.68
the soldier quickly forgets them.

691
00:26:50.68 --> 00:26:52.04
The soldiers quickly forget them.

692
00:26:52.04 --> 00:26:53.04
To overcome these tendencies,

693
00:26:53.04 --> 00:26:55.000
a combatives training system must be based

694
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.08
on certain principles and then maintained.

695
00:26:57.08 --> 00:26:59.84
So, this was another thing I ran into that in the SEAL teams,

696
00:26:59.84 --> 00:27:01.60
like for a while, the SEAL teams was using this system

697
00:27:01.60 --> 00:27:06.60
where one of the best benefits of the system

698
00:27:07.76 --> 00:27:09.92
claimed by the people that were pushing the system was,

699
00:27:09.92 --> 00:27:12.48
hey, this system that we're being taught

700
00:27:12.48 --> 00:27:14.000
only takes five days to learn.

701
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.84
Yeah.

702
00:27:14.84 --> 00:27:17.20
So, and meanwhile, some people are talking about

703
00:27:17.20 --> 00:27:21.84
becoming, using more mixed martial arts based systems

704
00:27:21.84 --> 00:27:24.52
when those things take years to become an expert.

705
00:27:24.52 --> 00:27:26.64
Why would we do that?

706
00:27:26.64 --> 00:27:28.80
It's sort of like seven minute abs, right?

707
00:27:28.80 --> 00:27:29.64
It's like, this is it.

708
00:27:29.64 --> 00:27:30.48
You're like, dude, I'm not,

709
00:27:30.48 --> 00:27:33.40
why do all this cardio weightlifting and diet

710
00:27:33.40 --> 00:27:34.24
and all this stuff?

711
00:27:34.24 --> 00:27:35.84
I can just do seven minute abs

712
00:27:35.84 --> 00:27:37.52
and I'll be good to go with the abs.

713
00:27:37.52 --> 00:27:38.68
Six minute abs.

714
00:27:38.68 --> 00:27:39.52
Six minute abs.

715
00:27:39.52 --> 00:27:40.36
I'll sell you.

716
00:27:40.36 --> 00:27:41.20
Oh yeah, you outsold me.

717
00:27:41.20 --> 00:27:46.20
So, don't fall for that, that idea that,

718
00:27:47.16 --> 00:27:49.84
oh, the reason you should use my system

719
00:27:49.84 --> 00:27:51.48
is because it's faster.

720
00:27:51.48 --> 00:27:54.48
It's not a good, it's not real.

721
00:27:54.48 --> 00:27:58.08
Cause you're not gonna become a good fighter in five days.

722
00:27:58.08 --> 00:28:01.52
Could you learn a couple fundamental moves in five days?

723
00:28:01.52 --> 00:28:02.88
Yes, you absolutely could.

724
00:28:02.88 --> 00:28:04.92
You absolutely can and they could save your life.

725
00:28:04.92 --> 00:28:05.76
Yeah.

726
00:28:05.76 --> 00:28:06.92
You know, you could, you could,

727
00:28:06.92 --> 00:28:10.68
your life could be saved by knowing some fundamental moves

728
00:28:10.68 --> 00:28:13.000
that you learn in a five day period.

729
00:28:15.32 --> 00:28:16.76
But are you gonna be well versed?

730
00:28:16.76 --> 00:28:17.60
No.

731
00:28:17.60 --> 00:28:19.24
Are you gonna forget those moves?

732
00:28:19.24 --> 00:28:20.24
Yes.

733
00:28:20.24 --> 00:28:21.20
Are you gonna know how to react

734
00:28:21.20 --> 00:28:22.68
when there's a variable involved?

735
00:28:22.68 --> 00:28:23.52
No.

736
00:28:23.52 --> 00:28:28.52
So, there is no easy, quick solution to be good at fighting.

737
00:28:29.36 --> 00:28:30.76
It doesn't exist.

738
00:28:30.76 --> 00:28:35.24
Could you learn, you know, three dynamic moves

739
00:28:35.24 --> 00:28:36.84
that if you're a bouncer in a bar

740
00:28:36.84 --> 00:28:38.12
and you're going against some drunk guy

741
00:28:38.12 --> 00:28:39.56
that doesn't expect it and you do these moves,

742
00:28:39.56 --> 00:28:41.88
that'll probably work a lot.

743
00:28:41.88 --> 00:28:43.44
What happens when that dude drops in

744
00:28:43.44 --> 00:28:45.60
and does a double leg on you, you know?

745
00:28:45.60 --> 00:28:49.28
Or squares up and is like a skilled fighter.

746
00:28:49.28 --> 00:28:51.12
It's gonna be a problem.

747
00:28:51.12 --> 00:28:54.44
So, here's the principles that they recommend.

748
00:28:54.44 --> 00:28:57.60
Systematic training, foundation, continuous training,

749
00:28:57.60 --> 00:28:59.20
competition drills, live training,

750
00:28:59.20 --> 00:29:01.32
integrated training, combat feedback.

751
00:29:01.32 --> 00:29:02.16
Cool.

752
00:29:02.16 --> 00:29:03.000
What'd you write, Dave?

753
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.60
No, I was gonna say like a kind of funny story.

754
00:29:06.72 --> 00:29:07.84
Like we're talking about weight loss.

755
00:29:07.84 --> 00:29:09.72
But so, you know, let's say when I go through

756
00:29:09.72 --> 00:29:11.32
my weight cutting phase, you know,

757
00:29:11.32 --> 00:29:14.56
I'll lose like 15 pounds in 10 days.

758
00:29:14.56 --> 00:29:16.64
And then I'll cut water weight, which is really unhealthy,

759
00:29:16.64 --> 00:29:18.64
but it's really, really bad for you to do that.

760
00:29:18.64 --> 00:29:22.32
But, you know, cut 33 pounds in 12 days,

761
00:29:22.32 --> 00:29:24.04
whatever you were there with me on that.

762
00:29:24.04 --> 00:29:27.04
But so, how do you lose that much weight in two weeks?

763
00:29:27.04 --> 00:29:28.80
I'm like, well, it's not sustainable, you know?

764
00:29:28.80 --> 00:29:30.12
I'd be honest, it's not the secret.

765
00:29:30.12 --> 00:29:31.92
You could do that, but it's a miserable life.

766
00:29:31.92 --> 00:29:34.52
It's hard to do and you can't do it forever.

767
00:29:34.52 --> 00:29:35.76
And remember when we were in Sarge,

768
00:29:35.76 --> 00:29:38.96
when he tried to cut 50 pounds in a week?

769
00:29:38.96 --> 00:29:42.36
And he had the look of death in his eye.

770
00:29:42.36 --> 00:29:45.04
So, Sarge lost like 25 pounds, right?

771
00:29:45.04 --> 00:29:49.000
Because Sarge, my Sarge is a good friend of ours, an ex-seal,

772
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.16
but he actually, I think he was trying to lose 40 pounds

773
00:29:51.16 --> 00:29:52.000
or something like that.

774
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.80
Yeah, he went and look, Sarge is about as hard as they come.

775
00:29:55.80 --> 00:29:57.44
As far as like just being like,

776
00:29:57.44 --> 00:30:00.24
I'm gonna finish this thing, whatever it is,

777
00:30:00.24 --> 00:30:03.08
he's up there in the top echelon of,

778
00:30:03.08 --> 00:30:05.000
I'm not gonna give up on this thing.

779
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.48
And it was almost walking dead, almost walking dead.

780
00:30:07.48 --> 00:30:12.48
I mean, and I remember I showed up at the gym

781
00:30:12.48 --> 00:30:14.52
and I saw him and he'd already, he was like.

782
00:30:14.52 --> 00:30:16.84
He was done.

783
00:30:16.84 --> 00:30:18.76
He was like, yeah, I was cutting.

784
00:30:18.76 --> 00:30:21.40
And he goes, he looked at me and with that dead serious look,

785
00:30:21.40 --> 00:30:23.12
he was like, I was gonna die soon.

786
00:30:23.12 --> 00:30:26.08
That was his assessment.

787
00:30:26.08 --> 00:30:28.04
He was like, yeah, he goes, I got down.

788
00:30:28.04 --> 00:30:30.40
I got 38 pounds and whatever.

789
00:30:30.40 --> 00:30:32.52
And he goes, and then I got to a point

790
00:30:32.52 --> 00:30:34.28
where I was gonna die soon.

791
00:30:34.28 --> 00:30:35.80
And he's a Corman, he's a medic.

792
00:30:35.80 --> 00:30:38.60
He's an independent duty Corman,

793
00:30:38.60 --> 00:30:40.16
which is like the highest level of,

794
00:30:40.16 --> 00:30:41.48
and you know, a special operation Corman.

795
00:30:41.48 --> 00:30:42.32
He needs little surgeries.

796
00:30:42.32 --> 00:30:44.24
So he's just like, yeah, I was gonna die soon.

797
00:30:44.24 --> 00:30:45.80
That was his assessment.

798
00:30:45.80 --> 00:30:47.68
So I was trying to tell you a story about one of our bros,

799
00:30:47.68 --> 00:30:49.76
but it's just funny, it's funny in a sadistic way,

800
00:30:49.76 --> 00:30:51.64
but even Sarge would laugh at it too.

801
00:30:51.64 --> 00:30:54.20
He has a good sense of humor, our type of humor.

802
00:30:54.20 --> 00:30:56.88
But so there is a way to lose weight that fast,

803
00:30:56.88 --> 00:30:58.48
but it's not sustainable, it's not healthy.

804
00:30:58.48 --> 00:30:59.64
Plus you have to know what you're doing

805
00:30:59.64 --> 00:31:01.08
and then you have no one to do it correctly.

806
00:31:01.08 --> 00:31:02.32
And then you cause again trouble.

807
00:31:02.32 --> 00:31:04.48
So weight loss, how about quick way to lose weight?

808
00:31:04.48 --> 00:31:06.52
Yeah, see it's possible, but it sucks.

809
00:31:06.52 --> 00:31:07.88
It's miserable, it's not sustainable.

810
00:31:07.88 --> 00:31:09.80
But you can actually get on a sensible diet,

811
00:31:09.80 --> 00:31:11.04
get into a consistent workout routine.

812
00:31:11.04 --> 00:31:11.96
And you know what?

813
00:31:11.96 --> 00:31:13.92
You could lose, let's say two pounds a week.

814
00:31:13.92 --> 00:31:16.40
You could do that consistently, you know, you can.

815
00:31:16.40 --> 00:31:17.84
And actually have energy, you can be fine.

816
00:31:17.84 --> 00:31:20.48
You'll be hungry, but you'll be fine.

817
00:31:20.48 --> 00:31:21.64
But it takes discipline, right?

818
00:31:21.64 --> 00:31:24.16
Discipline, so I'm talking to this, learn it.

819
00:31:25.96 --> 00:31:27.96
I see what they're saying, it sounds marketable,

820
00:31:27.96 --> 00:31:30.68
but as I was mentioning earlier,

821
00:31:30.68 --> 00:31:32.44
the quick fix way to get around things in training

822
00:31:32.44 --> 00:31:33.84
is usually not the best way.

823
00:31:33.84 --> 00:31:35.68
You're gonna have to put in the time, people.

824
00:31:35.68 --> 00:31:36.52
Yeah.

825
00:31:37.72 --> 00:31:39.12
And this is exactly what they say here.

826
00:31:39.12 --> 00:31:41.04
This next section is called systematic training.

827
00:31:41.04 --> 00:31:44.40
Learning to fight is a process, not an event.

828
00:31:44.40 --> 00:31:45.92
To be effective, combatives training

829
00:31:45.92 --> 00:31:47.88
must be part of a system.

830
00:31:47.88 --> 00:31:49.44
Until soldiers learn techniques

831
00:31:49.44 --> 00:31:51.52
that form the system's foundation,

832
00:31:51.52 --> 00:31:53.56
they are unprepared for follow on training.

833
00:31:53.56 --> 00:31:55.40
Short cuts or teaching soldiers,

834
00:31:55.40 --> 00:31:58.56
what they need to know is counterproductive.

835
00:31:58.56 --> 00:32:02.04
Much as advanced tactical training is counterproductive,

836
00:32:02.04 --> 00:32:03.84
if a soldier has not first been taught

837
00:32:03.84 --> 00:32:04.80
how to operate his weapon.

838
00:32:04.80 --> 00:32:08.24
Army combatives training must be based in a system

839
00:32:08.24 --> 00:32:10.52
that both lays a foundation of abilities

840
00:32:10.52 --> 00:32:12.48
that soldiers take with them wherever they are assigned

841
00:32:12.48 --> 00:32:13.72
and is flexible enough to fit

842
00:32:13.72 --> 00:32:17.32
the wide range of specialized missions soldiers are asked to do.

843
00:32:17.32 --> 00:32:19.96
So it's the same thing that we're talking about.

844
00:32:19.96 --> 00:32:21.60
Continuous training.

845
00:32:21.60 --> 00:32:23.76
Combatives training must not end

846
00:32:23.76 --> 00:32:26.16
upon graduation from a training course.

847
00:32:27.32 --> 00:32:28.16
And this is, by the way,

848
00:32:28.16 --> 00:32:29.96
everything we're saying applies to police officers as well.

849
00:32:29.96 --> 00:32:31.000
Yeah.

850
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.20
Unfortunately, a lot of cops,

851
00:32:32.20 --> 00:32:34.000
they don't have any more training after they got out

852
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.36
of the academy. No, it's horrible.

853
00:32:35.36 --> 00:32:38.76
Or they get three hours a year or four hours a year.

854
00:32:38.76 --> 00:32:40.08
Yeah.

855
00:32:40.08 --> 00:32:42.68
So training has to be continuous.

856
00:32:42.68 --> 00:32:44.24
It can't end when you graduate.

857
00:32:44.24 --> 00:32:45.64
For soldiers to develop their abilities,

858
00:32:45.64 --> 00:32:47.20
the majority of training must happen

859
00:32:47.20 --> 00:32:48.80
outside of the institutional training environment.

860
00:32:48.80 --> 00:32:49.96
So think about that.

861
00:32:49.96 --> 00:32:52.80
The majority of training has to be outside

862
00:32:52.80 --> 00:32:54.20
what you learn in the schoolhouse.

863
00:32:56.24 --> 00:32:58.48
Units must develop their own combatives programs

864
00:32:58.48 --> 00:33:00.76
to spur troops to involvement and courage commanders

865
00:33:00.76 --> 00:33:02.16
to invest resources.

866
00:33:02.16 --> 00:33:02.96
So there you go.

867
00:33:02.96 --> 00:33:04.12
Competition.

868
00:33:04.12 --> 00:33:06.76
Competition is the principal motivational tool

869
00:33:06.76 --> 00:33:09.60
used to spur combatives training.

870
00:33:09.60 --> 00:33:12.40
Competition should be not only used to encourage excellence

871
00:33:12.40 --> 00:33:15.28
by giving soldiers a chance to be unit champions,

872
00:33:15.28 --> 00:33:17.20
but also to make fighting ability

873
00:33:17.20 --> 00:33:18.96
an integral part of soldiering.

874
00:33:20.16 --> 00:33:22.48
So if you're not running some competitions,

875
00:33:22.48 --> 00:33:24.28
you're not gonna get people to train.

876
00:33:24.28 --> 00:33:25.64
And look, can you get someone that's like,

877
00:33:25.64 --> 00:33:27.28
hey, I'm just dedicated, no one might need it on the job?

878
00:33:27.28 --> 00:33:28.40
Sure.

879
00:33:28.40 --> 00:33:31.44
But how many of those 20-year-olds that we're talking about

880
00:33:31.44 --> 00:33:35.000
is gonna be like, dude, are you gonna do the brigade competition?

881
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.04
See who's got it?

882
00:33:36.04 --> 00:33:37.24
Got it?

883
00:33:37.24 --> 00:33:38.28
See where you're at?

884
00:33:39.24 --> 00:33:41.12
And by the way, what about you're doing

885
00:33:41.12 --> 00:33:42.32
the brigade composition.

886
00:33:42.32 --> 00:33:44.08
So you might wanna like train,

887
00:33:44.08 --> 00:33:45.32
so you're at least ready for yourself,

888
00:33:45.32 --> 00:33:46.56
look like a jag-ass.

889
00:33:49.28 --> 00:33:50.88
Talks about drills.

890
00:33:51.88 --> 00:33:52.96
You know, you gotta do drills.

891
00:33:52.96 --> 00:33:54.88
Live training, live training involves training

892
00:33:54.88 --> 00:33:57.60
against a fully resistant training partner,

893
00:33:57.60 --> 00:33:59.36
which approaches the reality of combat.

894
00:33:59.36 --> 00:34:01.24
That's what you were talking about earlier, Dean.

895
00:34:01.24 --> 00:34:02.68
There are many methods of live training.

896
00:34:02.68 --> 00:34:04.04
Each has its own strength and weaknesses.

897
00:34:04.04 --> 00:34:05.76
Therefore, leadership combines several approaches

898
00:34:05.76 --> 00:34:06.92
to ensure proper training.

899
00:34:07.92 --> 00:34:09.04
Integrated training.

900
00:34:09.04 --> 00:34:11.40
Combative engagements do not happen in a vacuum.

901
00:34:11.40 --> 00:34:12.84
They happen as part of a mission.

902
00:34:12.84 --> 00:34:15.28
So give soldiers the tools

903
00:34:15.28 --> 00:34:17.32
they need to successfully complete their missions.

904
00:34:17.32 --> 00:34:19.36
Combatives must be an integral part of the training.

905
00:34:19.36 --> 00:34:24.20
So that means you can't just make it an isolated, okay.

906
00:34:24.20 --> 00:34:26.20
Like, you know what a red man suit is?

907
00:34:26.20 --> 00:34:28.000
Red man suit is like the guy you can punch

908
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.60
because they're wearing like a big padded outfit.

909
00:34:30.60 --> 00:34:31.44
Yeah, yeah.

910
00:34:31.44 --> 00:34:32.28
Well, you need to integrate that

911
00:34:32.28 --> 00:34:34.68
into a random part of a regular mission,

912
00:34:34.68 --> 00:34:36.000
a regular training mission.

913
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.32
You can't say, oh, today we're doing combatives only.

914
00:34:38.32 --> 00:34:39.56
No, you need to walk into a room

915
00:34:39.56 --> 00:34:41.24
and there's gotta be some person in a red man suit

916
00:34:41.24 --> 00:34:43.12
just ready to throw down.

917
00:34:43.12 --> 00:34:44.32
And you gotta deal with it.

918
00:34:44.32 --> 00:34:46.28
And you gotta see how it affects everyone else in the room

919
00:34:46.28 --> 00:34:47.32
and how many people it takes

920
00:34:47.32 --> 00:34:49.12
and how it slows down the assault force

921
00:34:49.12 --> 00:34:50.12
and all that stuff.

922
00:34:51.88 --> 00:34:53.22
That's integrated training.

923
00:34:54.72 --> 00:34:56.68
Combat, what'd you write down, Dean?

924
00:34:56.68 --> 00:34:57.52
Just different things.

925
00:34:57.52 --> 00:34:59.80
I was just, I had random stories.

926
00:35:01.20 --> 00:35:02.60
I was gonna say, remember this,

927
00:35:02.60 --> 00:35:04.48
even people listen to this, you know, yeah, yeah,

928
00:35:04.48 --> 00:35:08.52
but the pretty lie is more appealing than the ugly truth.

929
00:35:08.52 --> 00:35:09.96
You know, so the ugly truth is,

930
00:35:09.96 --> 00:35:11.12
it's not really ugly if you get into it,

931
00:35:11.12 --> 00:35:12.68
you get into the sport, it's not so ugly.

932
00:35:12.68 --> 00:35:15.32
Or maybe that is the beauty of it in a way.

933
00:35:15.32 --> 00:35:18.24
But the pretty lie is always still appealing.

934
00:35:18.24 --> 00:35:21.16
I have a 40 course for you, you know,

935
00:35:21.16 --> 00:35:22.68
you're guaranteed to win every fight.

936
00:35:22.68 --> 00:35:24.16
That's still appealing to most people.

937
00:35:24.16 --> 00:35:26.32
Still is, even though we're seeing this.

938
00:35:26.32 --> 00:35:29.80
And I just hope that people listening to this,

939
00:35:29.80 --> 00:35:33.24
it's not, well, it is, it can be torturous,

940
00:35:33.24 --> 00:35:35.96
but it's something that lights a fire in your ass.

941
00:35:35.96 --> 00:35:37.92
But every day, as far as you wanna train more,

942
00:35:37.92 --> 00:35:39.68
I can get sick of Jiu-Jitsu for one day,

943
00:35:39.68 --> 00:35:40.52
and the next day I'm fine.

944
00:35:40.52 --> 00:35:41.88
I'm back into it for some reason.

945
00:35:41.88 --> 00:35:42.88
You can say give it a like, man,

946
00:35:42.88 --> 00:35:45.24
to the next day you're like, okay, you know, I'm back to it.

947
00:35:45.24 --> 00:35:46.68
You can definitely have a rough day on the box.

948
00:35:46.68 --> 00:35:48.60
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

949
00:35:48.60 --> 00:35:51.20
It's just that we talk about work,

950
00:35:51.20 --> 00:35:53.32
repetition, drills, competition, all this stuff.

951
00:35:53.32 --> 00:35:55.48
It seems like a lot to do, it is a lot to do.

952
00:35:55.48 --> 00:35:58.84
But I mean, this is the ugly truth, you know what I'm saying?

953
00:35:58.84 --> 00:36:00.40
So that's just what I was writing down,

954
00:36:00.40 --> 00:36:02.56
just that the pretty lie is still appealing to people

955
00:36:02.56 --> 00:36:03.76
that are listening to this right now.

956
00:36:03.76 --> 00:36:05.12
The pretty lie is still out there,

957
00:36:05.12 --> 00:36:07.000
it's still, we saw that people are gonna be tempted by it.

958
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.84
Yeah, still.

959
00:36:07.84 --> 00:36:10.72
And the pretty lie you want, you want it to be true.

960
00:36:10.72 --> 00:36:11.56
Because it's easier.

961
00:36:11.56 --> 00:36:12.40
It's true.

962
00:36:12.40 --> 00:36:13.24
You want it to be true.

963
00:36:13.24 --> 00:36:16.24
That's how Get Rich Quick schemes work, right?

964
00:36:16.24 --> 00:36:21.24
People want to believe that a mere $1,299 investment now

965
00:36:22.68 --> 00:36:24.92
when you learn these skills.

966
00:36:24.92 --> 00:36:25.76
That's true.

967
00:36:25.76 --> 00:36:28.16
Choco, I wanted to believe that you could lose

968
00:36:28.16 --> 00:36:32.32
18 pounds of water by being in an Epsom salt tub

969
00:36:32.32 --> 00:36:33.16
in half hour.

970
00:36:33.16 --> 00:36:34.48
I wanted to believe that.

971
00:36:34.48 --> 00:36:35.64
It was not true.

972
00:36:35.64 --> 00:36:37.000
No, quarter pound.

973
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.72
Have you ever missed weight?

974
00:36:38.72 --> 00:36:39.92
No, no, I was made weight.

975
00:36:39.92 --> 00:36:40.76
Yeah.

976
00:36:40.76 --> 00:36:41.60
Yeah, I was made weight.

977
00:36:41.60 --> 00:36:43.52
Man, you suffered a few times.

978
00:36:43.52 --> 00:36:45.48
Yeah, I have big bones, I don't know.

979
00:36:45.48 --> 00:36:46.36
It's not fun.

980
00:36:46.36 --> 00:36:48.20
Big bones and pizza, bro.

981
00:36:48.20 --> 00:36:49.04
Pizza.

982
00:36:49.04 --> 00:36:52.24
You could do it a couple times.

983
00:36:52.24 --> 00:36:55.68
It was like, all right, let's check your weight.

984
00:36:55.68 --> 00:36:58.72
Oh, you're 28 pounds over

985
00:36:58.72 --> 00:37:01.08
and you gotta fight in six days.

986
00:37:01.08 --> 00:37:02.88
You gotta get pizza for it.

987
00:37:02.88 --> 00:37:03.92
How's that pizza tasting?

988
00:37:03.92 --> 00:37:04.92
I hope it was good.

989
00:37:06.20 --> 00:37:07.04
Now you gotta pay.

990
00:37:09.44 --> 00:37:11.28
Combat feedback, when soldiers engaged

991
00:37:11.28 --> 00:37:12.40
or engaged in hand to hand combat,

992
00:37:12.40 --> 00:37:14.84
they acquire new information about combatants.

993
00:37:14.84 --> 00:37:16.76
These lessons must be captured and analyzed

994
00:37:16.76 --> 00:37:19.36
so the combatants program evolves

995
00:37:19.36 --> 00:37:21.44
to fit the needs of soldiers.

996
00:37:21.44 --> 00:37:23.000
Through combat feedback,

997
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.32
the following lessons have been learned

998
00:37:24.32 --> 00:37:27.40
and it goes through every fight is a grappling fight.

999
00:37:27.40 --> 00:37:29.32
Of course, this does not mean that there is no striking.

1000
00:37:29.32 --> 00:37:31.20
Every fight also involves striking,

1001
00:37:31.20 --> 00:37:35.68
but always as an integral part of grappling.

1002
00:37:35.68 --> 00:37:37.40
Every fight is over weapons.

1003
00:37:37.40 --> 00:37:38.64
Control of this element

1004
00:37:38.64 --> 00:37:41.72
will most likely determine the outcome of the fight.

1005
00:37:41.72 --> 00:37:43.68
There's no shortcut to developing a fighting skill.

1006
00:37:43.68 --> 00:37:44.72
The combat feedback thing,

1007
00:37:44.72 --> 00:37:48.20
this is something like even when I was trying

1008
00:37:48.20 --> 00:37:51.84
to move naval special warfare

1009
00:37:51.84 --> 00:37:56.56
more towards a mixed martial arts view,

1010
00:37:57.64 --> 00:37:59.20
and some people would be like,

1011
00:37:59.20 --> 00:38:01.12
you think it should be jujitsu?

1012
00:38:01.12 --> 00:38:01.96
And I'd be like, no, actually,

1013
00:38:01.96 --> 00:38:04.20
I don't just think it should be jujitsu at all.

1014
00:38:05.16 --> 00:38:06.96
And in fact, and this was the most important thing

1015
00:38:06.96 --> 00:38:09.80
I tried to say was it shouldn't be closed.

1016
00:38:09.80 --> 00:38:10.92
It shouldn't be a closed,

1017
00:38:10.92 --> 00:38:13.56
it shouldn't even be a quote system.

1018
00:38:13.56 --> 00:38:18.56
It should be an open learning, continuous learning,

1019
00:38:19.12 --> 00:38:22.36
evolving thing that we're always getting better at.

1020
00:38:22.36 --> 00:38:24.36
And that way there's things that work and they work now

1021
00:38:24.36 --> 00:38:25.72
and maybe if in the future

1022
00:38:25.72 --> 00:38:27.28
we have a different type of body armor

1023
00:38:27.28 --> 00:38:30.20
that is more dynamic or it takes up more space

1024
00:38:30.20 --> 00:38:31.36
or it's heavier or lighter or whatever,

1025
00:38:31.36 --> 00:38:33.16
like things are gonna change.

1026
00:38:33.16 --> 00:38:35.12
Or the way you're slinging your weapon now

1027
00:38:35.12 --> 00:38:37.28
or a different radio you gotta carry with that

1028
00:38:37.28 --> 00:38:38.44
causes something or a helmet.

1029
00:38:38.44 --> 00:38:39.32
Like there's all kinds of things

1030
00:38:39.32 --> 00:38:40.80
you gotta make adjustments to.

1031
00:38:40.80 --> 00:38:43.40
You grapple with plates on the body armor plates.

1032
00:38:43.40 --> 00:38:44.36
Cause the plates get really,

1033
00:38:44.36 --> 00:38:46.88
they get really in the way, let's say.

1034
00:38:46.88 --> 00:38:47.80
Yeah.

1035
00:38:47.80 --> 00:38:49.28
And there's certain things that,

1036
00:38:49.28 --> 00:38:50.12
yeah, there's certain things

1037
00:38:50.12 --> 00:38:53.20
that might not be optimum with plates.

1038
00:38:53.20 --> 00:38:55.78
And so, okay, well, what adjustments are you gonna make?

1039
00:38:55.78 --> 00:38:57.76
And maybe a new set of body armor comes out,

1040
00:38:57.76 --> 00:39:00.04
like you could put something called side zappy plates in

1041
00:39:00.04 --> 00:39:01.56
which now you have plates on your side.

1042
00:39:01.56 --> 00:39:03.24
And how does that inhibit your movement?

1043
00:39:03.24 --> 00:39:04.72
You're gonna find this ridiculous jockel

1044
00:39:04.72 --> 00:39:07.32
playing with the front plate and the back plate

1045
00:39:07.32 --> 00:39:10.60
and that's a belt on with, you know, whatever.

1046
00:39:10.60 --> 00:39:12.44
I don't say just stuff on the belt.

1047
00:39:12.44 --> 00:39:16.64
And I set up and guard and I had a little,

1048
00:39:16.64 --> 00:39:18.60
I was a little heavier back then

1049
00:39:18.60 --> 00:39:21.000
and the front plate pinched my, with the belt.

1050
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.84
And you tapped out.

1051
00:39:21.84 --> 00:39:26.84
Come on, I can't set up a guard to say, wait, wait.

1052
00:39:27.52 --> 00:39:29.08
Yeah, body armor is just a different thing.

1053
00:39:29.08 --> 00:39:31.12
So there's, we gotta watch out for that belly fat.

1054
00:39:31.12 --> 00:39:31.96
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1055
00:39:31.96 --> 00:39:32.80
Well, you guys, there's a weight.

1056
00:39:32.80 --> 00:39:33.64
No, there's no problem.

1057
00:39:33.64 --> 00:39:34.64
We gotta stay lean.

1058
00:39:35.68 --> 00:39:36.64
So that's, that's good.

1059
00:39:36.64 --> 00:39:37.48
It's ridiculous.

1060
00:39:38.40 --> 00:39:42.60
The idea that whatever you're training in should evolve.

1061
00:39:42.60 --> 00:39:44.02
And look, it's beautiful to see right now

1062
00:39:44.02 --> 00:39:46.48
Jujitsu evolving like crazy.

1063
00:39:46.48 --> 00:39:49.08
And it's kind of evolving exponentially.

1064
00:39:49.08 --> 00:39:52.08
I think Jujitsu is evolving exponentially now

1065
00:39:52.08 --> 00:39:55.84
cause every one move leads, let's just say theoretically

1066
00:39:55.84 --> 00:39:58.42
every one move leads to two moves.

1067
00:39:58.42 --> 00:40:00.68
Would you say that's something you could say, could claim?

1068
00:40:00.68 --> 00:40:01.60
It should, it should, yeah.

1069
00:40:01.60 --> 00:40:02.68
Maybe even one move.

1070
00:40:02.68 --> 00:40:05.64
It could be that one move leads to four moves

1071
00:40:05.64 --> 00:40:07.84
and some one moves lead to seven moves.

1072
00:40:07.84 --> 00:40:10.12
But let's just say in general, conservatively,

1073
00:40:10.12 --> 00:40:12.76
every one move leads to two moves.

1074
00:40:12.76 --> 00:40:13.60
Sure.

1075
00:40:13.60 --> 00:40:15.40
So there's been so many new moves created

1076
00:40:15.40 --> 00:40:18.60
in the last 10 years that, and they've all created

1077
00:40:18.60 --> 00:40:20.92
and spawned more moves and more moves and more moves.

1078
00:40:20.92 --> 00:40:25.52
So it's a highly evolving sport.

1079
00:40:25.52 --> 00:40:27.12
Yeah, absolutely.

1080
00:40:27.12 --> 00:40:29.04
And some things that some things have been forgotten

1081
00:40:29.04 --> 00:40:31.60
or re-invented again for sure.

1082
00:40:32.76 --> 00:40:34.04
Someone's done a lot of things before.

1083
00:40:34.04 --> 00:40:35.000
Some things have been forgotten.

1084
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.88
Some things are out of style,

1085
00:40:35.88 --> 00:40:38.68
but some things are definitely being invented right now.

1086
00:40:40.16 --> 00:40:41.000
All right.

1087
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.36
Then this is a really thorough manual.

1088
00:40:43.36 --> 00:40:44.54
And this is what the army does, man.

1089
00:40:44.54 --> 00:40:45.96
The army doesn't play around.

1090
00:40:45.96 --> 00:40:48.44
They leave no room for interpretation on stuff.

1091
00:40:48.44 --> 00:40:49.80
They got things on safety.

1092
00:40:49.80 --> 00:40:52.08
They got the things on risk assessments

1093
00:40:52.08 --> 00:40:53.40
on how you're gonna keep everybody safe

1094
00:40:53.40 --> 00:40:54.56
while you're doing it.

1095
00:40:54.56 --> 00:40:57.000
One thing they say is combatives training

1096
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:57.92
has inherent risks.

1097
00:40:57.92 --> 00:41:00.000
These risks may not be readily apparent

1098
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.08
and are sometimes counterintuitive to the untrained person.

1099
00:41:02.08 --> 00:41:04.20
Therefore, a combatives instructor certified

1100
00:41:04.20 --> 00:41:06.64
at the appropriate level should be involved

1101
00:41:06.64 --> 00:41:09.80
in the process to mitigate these risks.

1102
00:41:09.80 --> 00:41:13.000
And it's also important as a trainer

1103
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.36
to be able to point out the risks of not training.

1104
00:41:15.36 --> 00:41:16.64
Like if you don't train,

1105
00:41:16.64 --> 00:41:19.24
because listen, if you train, you can sprain your ankle.

1106
00:41:19.24 --> 00:41:21.76
If you train, you can hurt your shoulder.

1107
00:41:21.76 --> 00:41:24.20
But if you don't train, what's the risk there?

1108
00:41:24.20 --> 00:41:25.04
The risk is you can...

1109
00:41:25.04 --> 00:41:25.88
Worst.

1110
00:41:25.88 --> 00:41:27.64
Yeah, it's gonna end up being worse.

1111
00:41:28.64 --> 00:41:33.64
So they go through how to set up a training area,

1112
00:41:33.84 --> 00:41:36.68
what's general safety precautions to make.

1113
00:41:36.68 --> 00:41:38.32
And then they got this thing.

1114
00:41:38.32 --> 00:41:39.88
This is interesting.

1115
00:41:39.88 --> 00:41:41.84
According to a report published

1116
00:41:41.84 --> 00:41:44.64
by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center,

1117
00:41:44.64 --> 00:41:48.92
730 individuals who served in an active or reserve component

1118
00:41:48.92 --> 00:41:50.84
in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps

1119
00:41:50.84 --> 00:41:53.80
were hospitalized or medically evacuated

1120
00:41:53.80 --> 00:41:58.12
for injuries incurred while performing wrestling, judo,

1121
00:41:58.12 --> 00:42:01.76
and unarmed combat training between January 2002

1122
00:42:01.76 --> 00:42:04.24
and December 2009.

1123
00:42:04.24 --> 00:42:07.60
This averages to roughly 100 personnel per year

1124
00:42:07.60 --> 00:42:09.32
during an eight year period.

1125
00:42:10.72 --> 00:42:12.72
Now, quite frankly, that's not that bad, I don't think.

1126
00:42:12.72 --> 00:42:14.56
I think that's actually pretty darn good to go,

1127
00:42:14.56 --> 00:42:17.76
considering how many people are actually training.

1128
00:42:17.76 --> 00:42:20.64
It says it should be noted that 194 personnel,

1129
00:42:20.64 --> 00:42:24.64
40% of those hospitalized and 26.6% of all injuries

1130
00:42:24.64 --> 00:42:28.48
were injured while off duty or have unknown duty status.

1131
00:42:29.76 --> 00:42:32.08
Unsupervised execution of combatives techniques

1132
00:42:32.08 --> 00:42:33.40
is strongly discouraged.

1133
00:42:33.40 --> 00:42:36.96
This also means some of that percentage is I got a bar fight.

1134
00:42:36.96 --> 00:42:39.92
And I went to my gunny sergeant and said,

1135
00:42:39.92 --> 00:42:42.48
hey, gunny, I was training combatives

1136
00:42:42.48 --> 00:42:46.28
and I broke my hand on my training partner's face.

1137
00:42:46.28 --> 00:42:47.68
Well, how's your body?

1138
00:42:47.68 --> 00:42:51.64
Oh, he's okay, but I need to get my cast.

1139
00:42:51.64 --> 00:42:53.28
So there's some of that going on.

1140
00:42:55.52 --> 00:42:58.28
Areas of the body most commonly injured

1141
00:42:58.28 --> 00:42:59.88
of the injuries documented in the study,

1142
00:42:59.88 --> 00:43:02.72
a large percentage of 45.6% occurred

1143
00:43:02.72 --> 00:43:04.52
in the lower extremities.

1144
00:43:04.52 --> 00:43:08.80
In fact, fractures primarily of the ankle, tibia, or fibula,

1145
00:43:08.80 --> 00:43:13.04
accounted for nearly one half of the injuries.

1146
00:43:13.04 --> 00:43:14.36
That's the thing to hide in me.

1147
00:43:14.36 --> 00:43:15.20
And you know what it shows you?

1148
00:43:15.20 --> 00:43:17.20
They're doing a lot of takedowns.

1149
00:43:17.20 --> 00:43:18.56
They're doing a lot of takedowns.

1150
00:43:18.56 --> 00:43:21.48
But isn't it weird also fractures?

1151
00:43:21.48 --> 00:43:23.32
They're talking about fractures.

1152
00:43:24.20 --> 00:43:29.20
And so fractures percentage was 50%.

1153
00:43:29.40 --> 00:43:31.92
Sprains and strains was only 13%.

1154
00:43:31.92 --> 00:43:32.96
And what I thought to myself is that's

1155
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:34.24
because you know what, you don't have to go to the hospital

1156
00:43:34.24 --> 00:43:36.40
for a sprain or a strain, so you're not reporting it.

1157
00:43:36.40 --> 00:43:39.48
I mean, how many times have you hurt your ankle

1158
00:43:41.64 --> 00:43:43.96
or your knee training?

1159
00:43:43.96 --> 00:43:45.60
A few times, kickboxing a few times.

1160
00:43:45.60 --> 00:43:48.52
And not going to the hospital.

1161
00:43:48.52 --> 00:43:49.36
Many times.

1162
00:43:49.36 --> 00:43:51.000
I mean, it's like ridiculous, right?

1163
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:51.92
How many times did I go home?

1164
00:43:51.92 --> 00:43:53.92
Like, I've kind of limping a little bit.

1165
00:43:53.92 --> 00:43:55.68
You know, my shoulders tweaked.

1166
00:43:55.68 --> 00:43:59.80
My elbow got straightened out, the enlistor, whatever.

1167
00:43:59.80 --> 00:44:01.16
So I think a lot of the strain,

1168
00:44:01.16 --> 00:44:03.48
I think sprains and strains is actually,

1169
00:44:03.48 --> 00:44:04.52
you're gonna get them.

1170
00:44:04.52 --> 00:44:05.64
It's like almost 100%.

1171
00:44:05.64 --> 00:44:06.64
Yeah.

1172
00:44:06.64 --> 00:44:07.72
But people just kind of like,

1173
00:44:07.72 --> 00:44:09.28
oh, just put ice on it and call it good.

1174
00:44:09.28 --> 00:44:12.80
Well, you think maybe that these lower extremities,

1175
00:44:12.80 --> 00:44:15.08
injuries is from like kicking?

1176
00:44:15.08 --> 00:44:16.60
Well, I don't know.

1177
00:44:16.60 --> 00:44:17.80
My goodness.

1178
00:44:17.80 --> 00:44:19.08
I think it's takedowns.

1179
00:44:19.08 --> 00:44:19.92
Takedowns, yeah.

1180
00:44:19.92 --> 00:44:22.12
Straight up fractures, I mean, I guess.

1181
00:44:22.12 --> 00:44:24.32
Also, you know how maybe they'll turn the wrong way?

1182
00:44:24.32 --> 00:44:25.92
You know, a good rest of the face with hips.

1183
00:44:25.92 --> 00:44:27.72
You know, I'm just saying, like when someone's learning,

1184
00:44:27.72 --> 00:44:29.24
you're going through those rough areas

1185
00:44:29.24 --> 00:44:31.48
where more likely to get hurt, you know?

1186
00:44:31.48 --> 00:44:33.72
Yeah, actually, if you think about

1187
00:44:33.72 --> 00:44:37.64
how many broken bones have you seen

1188
00:44:37.64 --> 00:44:39.84
on the mats during training?

1189
00:44:39.84 --> 00:44:40.68
Not many.

1190
00:44:40.68 --> 00:44:41.52
Yeah, no, it's usually the ankle.

1191
00:44:41.52 --> 00:44:43.40
I think I've seen two.

1192
00:44:43.40 --> 00:44:44.76
I think I've seen two.

1193
00:44:44.76 --> 00:44:49.44
One like ankle and one shoulder.

1194
00:44:49.44 --> 00:44:50.36
Radial.

1195
00:44:50.36 --> 00:44:52.64
Yeah, I got caught in, my buddy got caught in.

1196
00:44:52.64 --> 00:44:53.48
Bicep slicer.

1197
00:44:53.48 --> 00:44:54.48
Bicep slicer.

1198
00:44:54.48 --> 00:44:55.72
And I heard it crack.

1199
00:44:56.72 --> 00:44:58.64
Spiral fracture.

1200
00:44:58.64 --> 00:44:59.48
And he was in the,

1201
00:44:59.48 --> 00:45:01.52
it's still going on deployment.

1202
00:45:01.52 --> 00:45:02.36
Damn.

1203
00:45:02.36 --> 00:45:04.60
But yeah, that's why it's weird.

1204
00:45:04.60 --> 00:45:05.44
But how many people,

1205
00:45:05.44 --> 00:45:08.12
how many times have you seen someone get a sprained ankle,

1206
00:45:08.12 --> 00:45:08.96
a sprained knee?

1207
00:45:08.96 --> 00:45:10.52
It's like, you can't count them all.

1208
00:45:10.52 --> 00:45:12.92
So this is a weird thing.

1209
00:45:12.92 --> 00:45:14.60
This is a weird thing.

1210
00:45:14.60 --> 00:45:16.48
And then it goes on to dislocations

1211
00:45:16.48 --> 00:45:19.32
and skull or bone fractures

1212
00:45:19.32 --> 00:45:21.20
and other intercranial injuries,

1213
00:45:21.20 --> 00:45:23.64
other injuries, concussions.

1214
00:45:23.64 --> 00:45:25.48
Concussions, they've only got a 3%.

1215
00:45:25.48 --> 00:45:28.88
Choco, I think people get hurt on the obstacle course.

1216
00:45:28.88 --> 00:45:29.72
You know what I'm saying?

1217
00:45:29.72 --> 00:45:32.40
On the obstacle course, probably not a ton,

1218
00:45:32.40 --> 00:45:33.80
but how many people get hurt

1219
00:45:33.80 --> 00:45:36.12
going through land warfare training out in the desert?

1220
00:45:36.12 --> 00:45:36.96
Oh, you know.

1221
00:45:36.96 --> 00:45:37.80
In every,

1222
00:45:37.80 --> 00:45:38.64
Any kind of training.

1223
00:45:38.64 --> 00:45:39.52
Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.

1224
00:45:39.52 --> 00:45:40.92
Like what in land warfare training?

1225
00:45:40.92 --> 00:45:41.76
Like what ankle?

1226
00:45:41.76 --> 00:45:42.72
Twisted ankle.

1227
00:45:42.72 --> 00:45:43.56
Running.

1228
00:45:43.56 --> 00:45:44.88
Hurt me.

1229
00:45:44.88 --> 00:45:47.12
You're usually an ankle and you're a back, right?

1230
00:45:47.12 --> 00:45:47.96
Oh, for.

1231
00:45:47.96 --> 00:45:48.80
Picking up my buddy.

1232
00:45:48.80 --> 00:45:49.64
Oh, yeah.

1233
00:45:49.64 --> 00:45:50.92
Kind of especially when some people are running

1234
00:45:50.92 --> 00:45:52.12
in land warfare.

1235
00:45:52.12 --> 00:45:53.68
And there was a lot of buddy caring to be done.

1236
00:45:53.68 --> 00:45:55.28
Sorry, fellas.

1237
00:45:55.28 --> 00:45:56.92
Just trying to be ready for war.

1238
00:45:56.92 --> 00:45:57.76
But,

1239
00:45:57.76 --> 00:46:00.000
Yeah, people are gonna get injured.

1240
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.16
Here's another one like fast roping or parachuting.

1241
00:46:02.16 --> 00:46:04.80
Like people break their ankle, people land wrong,

1242
00:46:04.80 --> 00:46:05.64
people get hurt.

1243
00:46:05.64 --> 00:46:07.32
So yeah, you're doing high risk training.

1244
00:46:07.32 --> 00:46:08.48
People are gonna get hurt.

1245
00:46:09.80 --> 00:46:11.24
Traumatic brain injury.

1246
00:46:12.44 --> 00:46:14.92
The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center study

1247
00:46:14.92 --> 00:46:16.76
concluded that a relatively small percentage

1248
00:46:16.76 --> 00:46:20.36
of 15.5% of combatives related injuries occur

1249
00:46:20.36 --> 00:46:23.56
in the head, back, neck and nervous system.

1250
00:46:23.56 --> 00:46:26.72
Dude, I don't think 15% is a small number.

1251
00:46:26.72 --> 00:46:27.64
I don't like that number.

1252
00:46:27.64 --> 00:46:30.12
However, these injuries can have disastrous consequences,

1253
00:46:30.12 --> 00:46:32.12
which can include traumatic brain injuries.

1254
00:46:32.12 --> 00:46:32.96
That's why you gotta spar.

1255
00:46:32.96 --> 00:46:34.68
You can't spar every day.

1256
00:46:34.68 --> 00:46:36.36
It'll be boxing every day.

1257
00:46:36.36 --> 00:46:37.20
Oh, yeah.

1258
00:46:37.20 --> 00:46:38.04
And for sure.

1259
00:46:38.04 --> 00:46:39.08
That's something that we've learned

1260
00:46:39.08 --> 00:46:42.76
and you and I had did not learn until it was too late

1261
00:46:42.76 --> 00:46:45.20
because we already probably sparred hundreds of rounds

1262
00:46:45.20 --> 00:46:49.24
back in the day live with MMA gloves, by the way,

1263
00:46:49.24 --> 00:46:50.48
which is not smart.

1264
00:46:52.60 --> 00:46:54.76
You can see better, you know?

1265
00:46:54.76 --> 00:46:56.48
I mean, yeah.

1266
00:46:56.48 --> 00:46:59.20
I mean, that's kind of disturbing.

1267
00:46:59.20 --> 00:47:02.24
You know, when you think about all the rounds you did

1268
00:47:03.24 --> 00:47:06.36
back in the day while training for camp,

1269
00:47:07.48 --> 00:47:09.96
it is a lot of you getting punched in the head.

1270
00:47:09.96 --> 00:47:12.80
Do you spar with MMA gloves just striking

1271
00:47:12.80 --> 00:47:14.20
or is it a full?

1272
00:47:14.20 --> 00:47:15.72
Both, usually take downs.

1273
00:47:15.72 --> 00:47:19.76
But you know, you put Vaseline on or you put a,

1274
00:47:19.76 --> 00:47:21.44
wear a headgear and small gloves

1275
00:47:21.44 --> 00:47:23.16
or big gloves and no headgear.

1276
00:47:23.16 --> 00:47:24.000
Yeah, depends.

1277
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.64
But that's, you know, we kind of evolved.

1278
00:47:27.64 --> 00:47:30.96
And now it's evolved like God's spar a lot less.

1279
00:47:30.96 --> 00:47:32.36
A lot less.

1280
00:47:32.36 --> 00:47:35.72
Wasn't back when you were going through seal training,

1281
00:47:35.72 --> 00:47:37.48
they put the boats on your head and jump on the boats.

1282
00:47:37.48 --> 00:47:38.32
So like that.

1283
00:47:38.32 --> 00:47:39.16
But now they don't do that.

1284
00:47:39.16 --> 00:47:40.000
They don't do that anymore.

1285
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.04
Yeah, but see, you learn from the past

1286
00:47:41.04 --> 00:47:45.48
because everyone has bad necks, jigs, you, pause, everyone.

1287
00:47:45.48 --> 00:47:46.32
Sarge.

1288
00:47:46.32 --> 00:47:48.32
Yeah, that wasn't healthy.

1289
00:47:48.32 --> 00:47:49.48
Yeah, that was not healthy.

1290
00:47:49.48 --> 00:47:50.32
You got a boat on your head

1291
00:47:50.32 --> 00:47:54.56
and the freaking 220 pound instructor jumps into the boat.

1292
00:47:54.56 --> 00:47:55.40
They put sand in it.

1293
00:47:55.40 --> 00:47:58.16
And it's not like that moment of impact.

1294
00:47:58.16 --> 00:48:02.84
The weight is distributed evenly amongst the six

1295
00:48:02.84 --> 00:48:03.80
or seven heads in there.

1296
00:48:03.80 --> 00:48:06.72
No, he lands wherever he lands.

1297
00:48:06.72 --> 00:48:10.84
And it takes at least, you know, yeah, that was not good.

1298
00:48:10.84 --> 00:48:12.44
And it feels like there's no real benefit

1299
00:48:12.44 --> 00:48:14.32
in that kind of quote unquote training.

1300
00:48:14.32 --> 00:48:16.16
Yeah, there is no benefit.

1301
00:48:16.16 --> 00:48:17.52
It's only a negative.

1302
00:48:17.52 --> 00:48:18.88
It's kind of like getting punched in the head.

1303
00:48:18.88 --> 00:48:19.72
Yeah, yeah.

1304
00:48:19.72 --> 00:48:20.56
Very.

1305
00:48:20.56 --> 00:48:22.000
Now listen, you have to get punched a little bit.

1306
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.84
Yeah.

1307
00:48:22.84 --> 00:48:24.20
So that you are used to it and you're not scared of it,

1308
00:48:24.20 --> 00:48:27.24
but you don't get better at getting punched in the head.

1309
00:48:27.24 --> 00:48:28.76
That's why we don't line people on walls

1310
00:48:28.76 --> 00:48:30.48
and just start going ham on their face.

1311
00:48:30.48 --> 00:48:32.08
You know those videos where guys line up on the wall

1312
00:48:32.08 --> 00:48:33.08
and start just punching.

1313
00:48:33.08 --> 00:48:33.92
Yeah.

1314
00:48:33.92 --> 00:48:35.48
That's just freaking.

1315
00:48:35.48 --> 00:48:36.60
Different tactics.

1316
00:48:36.60 --> 00:48:37.64
That's not just different tactics.

1317
00:48:37.64 --> 00:48:40.76
That's like freaking jerks.

1318
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.28
Traumatic brain injury occurs

1319
00:48:46.28 --> 00:48:48.24
when a sudden trauma or a head injury

1320
00:48:48.24 --> 00:48:50.48
disrupts the function of the brain,

1321
00:48:50.48 --> 00:48:53.44
initiating the onset or worsening of the following symptoms,

1322
00:48:53.44 --> 00:48:55.80
loss of or decreased level of consciousness,

1323
00:48:55.80 --> 00:48:59.60
loss of memory for events immediately after altercation,

1324
00:48:59.60 --> 00:49:01.88
alteration in mental state,

1325
00:49:01.88 --> 00:49:03.80
confusion, disorientation,

1326
00:49:03.80 --> 00:49:06.68
neurological deficits, weakness,

1327
00:49:06.68 --> 00:49:08.32
loss of balance, change in vision.

1328
00:49:09.36 --> 00:49:12.72
So you get a lot of these things

1329
00:49:12.72 --> 00:49:16.08
if you're sparring all the time and you shouldn't.

1330
00:49:16.08 --> 00:49:18.40
So don't.

1331
00:49:21.32 --> 00:49:24.80
And it goes on to some more of this danger.

1332
00:49:25.92 --> 00:49:27.44
Should a soldier exhibit any of the symptoms

1333
00:49:27.44 --> 00:49:28.44
of traumatic brain injury?

1334
00:49:28.44 --> 00:49:29.64
Soldiers should ask,

1335
00:49:29.64 --> 00:49:31.60
should seek immediate emergency evaluation.

1336
00:49:31.60 --> 00:49:32.84
This is how, I mean,

1337
00:49:32.84 --> 00:49:35.60
remember when I got a really bad concussion from you?

1338
00:49:35.60 --> 00:49:36.44
That's it.

1339
00:49:36.44 --> 00:49:37.52
You felt like three or four.

1340
00:49:37.52 --> 00:49:38.92
Yeah, but there was the worst one

1341
00:49:38.92 --> 00:49:40.64
where I went actually had to go to the hospital.

1342
00:49:40.64 --> 00:49:41.68
Yeah, I do call that, yeah.

1343
00:49:41.68 --> 00:49:44.48
And I remember the doctor said,

1344
00:49:44.48 --> 00:49:47.76
hey, you know, no contact for,

1345
00:49:47.76 --> 00:49:49.16
I think she said six months.

1346
00:49:49.16 --> 00:49:50.000
What happened?

1347
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.32
Which one was that?

1348
00:49:51.32 --> 00:49:52.56
Did you hit on my knee or something?

1349
00:49:52.56 --> 00:49:53.40
No.

1350
00:49:54.48 --> 00:49:55.32
Oh, I shot.

1351
00:49:55.32 --> 00:49:57.08
Yeah, it was a head.

1352
00:49:57.08 --> 00:49:58.92
It was your head hitting my head.

1353
00:49:58.92 --> 00:50:00.52
You sprawled and my head hit your chin.

1354
00:50:00.52 --> 00:50:01.36
Yeah, okay.

1355
00:50:01.36 --> 00:50:04.84
Yeah, and it didn't knock me out, knock me down.

1356
00:50:04.84 --> 00:50:06.52
And then I was, remember I was looking up at the roof.

1357
00:50:06.52 --> 00:50:09.04
Like I saw that the, the, the, the, I was like,

1358
00:50:09.04 --> 00:50:11.28
why is Dean rotating me right now?

1359
00:50:11.28 --> 00:50:12.84
Cause I feel like it.

1360
00:50:12.84 --> 00:50:13.68
That's why.

1361
00:50:13.68 --> 00:50:15.16
I was Dean cause he was across side and like,

1362
00:50:15.16 --> 00:50:16.92
I'm looking up at the rafters and city boxing.

1363
00:50:16.92 --> 00:50:18.56
Remember the city boxing had those big rafters

1364
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:19.92
and I'm looking at them and they're turning.

1365
00:50:19.92 --> 00:50:22.40
And I'm like, I'm trying to put my feet to stop you

1366
00:50:22.40 --> 00:50:24.32
from turning me, but it wasn't turning.

1367
00:50:24.32 --> 00:50:25.16
I was turning you by the way.

1368
00:50:25.16 --> 00:50:27.20
Yeah, no, you weren't.

1369
00:50:27.20 --> 00:50:28.84
And then I woke up in the middle of the night,

1370
00:50:28.84 --> 00:50:29.96
was throwing up and dizzy.

1371
00:50:29.96 --> 00:50:31.16
I couldn't walk through the bathroom.

1372
00:50:31.16 --> 00:50:35.28
And so I went to the hospital cause a boxer had just died.

1373
00:50:35.28 --> 00:50:36.12
That's right.

1374
00:50:36.12 --> 00:50:36.96
Yeah.

1375
00:50:36.96 --> 00:50:37.80
A boxer had just died.

1376
00:50:37.80 --> 00:50:40.04
And I was like, bro, I'm messed up.

1377
00:50:40.04 --> 00:50:42.84
And one of my team guy friends came and drove me to the

1378
00:50:42.84 --> 00:50:46.72
hospital cause I couldn't like, I was done.

1379
00:50:46.72 --> 00:50:50.16
And, but here's the, here's done.

1380
00:50:50.16 --> 00:50:51.16
Now here's dumb.

1381
00:50:51.16 --> 00:50:53.88
She's like no contact for six months.

1382
00:50:53.88 --> 00:50:54.92
And I was like, cool.

1383
00:50:54.92 --> 00:50:57.16
Four weeks later, I was like, I think I'm good to go.

1384
00:50:57.16 --> 00:50:58.000
Yeah.

1385
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.80
And I was, we were training again.

1386
00:50:59.80 --> 00:51:01.20
Like doing that.

1387
00:51:01.20 --> 00:51:02.60
So don't be stupid.

1388
00:51:02.60 --> 00:51:04.32
Did you get amnesia or anything like that?

1389
00:51:04.32 --> 00:51:05.64
No.

1390
00:51:05.64 --> 00:51:07.000
No, I didn't.

1391
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.44
I got a concussion from football.

1392
00:51:08.44 --> 00:51:10.88
I think I told you this where I got amnesia straight up.

1393
00:51:10.88 --> 00:51:14.40
Woke up like, not well, I was conscious, but I woke up, you

1394
00:51:14.40 --> 00:51:17.40
know, you come to the amnesia or whatever, just confused.

1395
00:51:17.40 --> 00:51:18.04
Same deal.

1396
00:51:18.04 --> 00:51:18.88
No contact.

1397
00:51:18.88 --> 00:51:21.16
But they were like, well, it's your first concussion.

1398
00:51:21.16 --> 00:51:24.04
The next week I played a game.

1399
00:51:24.04 --> 00:51:26.80
The first hit I took another amnesia scenario.

1400
00:51:26.80 --> 00:51:28.36
It was like, I don't know where I am or whatever.

1401
00:51:28.36 --> 00:51:31.48
That's why they have concussion protocol now and all this stuff.

1402
00:51:31.48 --> 00:51:33.48
They didn't used to have that back in the day when you were

1403
00:51:33.48 --> 00:51:35.40
over there at Kauai High.

1404
00:51:35.40 --> 00:51:35.92
Yeah.

1405
00:51:35.92 --> 00:51:38.80
I had probably about 10 serious ones, but one of them

1406
00:51:38.80 --> 00:51:41.44
after Japan, I fought a runner.

1407
00:51:41.44 --> 00:51:44.96
I went to Spain, like, Rathwards, and I was like a 12-year-old kid.

1408
00:51:44.96 --> 00:51:49.12
Like, I had the mental capacity of about a 12-year-old kid.

1409
00:51:49.12 --> 00:51:50.64
I was like, hey, I didn't do it.

1410
00:51:50.64 --> 00:51:51.88
And I would just do it.

1411
00:51:51.88 --> 00:51:54.84
I was very, I don't know, for about two weeks.

1412
00:51:54.84 --> 00:51:55.84
Yeah.

1413
00:51:55.84 --> 00:51:57.88
Did you felt out of it or was it just?

1414
00:51:57.88 --> 00:51:59.000
You know, I understand.

1415
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.88
I'm going to fall down, catch myself.

1416
00:52:01.88 --> 00:52:03.60
So I was twice a day, so I was twice a week,

1417
00:52:03.60 --> 00:52:04.52
and then I went down.

1418
00:52:04.52 --> 00:52:06.76
Even like six months later, I got like one or two of those.

1419
00:52:06.76 --> 00:52:08.000
Like, well, I got to sit down.

1420
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.12
But not for a long time.

1421
00:52:09.12 --> 00:52:09.92
Not for a long time.

1422
00:52:09.92 --> 00:52:11.44
You just like playing with Legos and stuff.

1423
00:52:11.44 --> 00:52:12.44
Yeah.

1424
00:52:12.44 --> 00:52:13.84
Coloring you.

1425
00:52:13.84 --> 00:52:14.72
Damn, a chocolate.

1426
00:52:14.72 --> 00:52:15.28
That's good time.

1427
00:52:15.28 --> 00:52:15.92
Well-timed.

1428
00:52:15.92 --> 00:52:18.32
But, Brian, they're like, hey, how long?

1429
00:52:18.32 --> 00:52:20.12
Six months or whatever?

1430
00:52:20.12 --> 00:52:21.68
Because, yeah, you feel better.

1431
00:52:21.68 --> 00:52:23.04
Because even the next week, I felt better.

1432
00:52:23.04 --> 00:52:24.04
I was like, bro, I'm not dizzy.

1433
00:52:24.04 --> 00:52:27.16
I don't feel no pain or whatever, but like, your head is so weak now.

1434
00:52:27.16 --> 00:52:29.44
So like, you could get like a small light,

1435
00:52:29.44 --> 00:52:30.48
I got a light hit.

1436
00:52:30.48 --> 00:52:31.28
It was a light hit.

1437
00:52:31.28 --> 00:52:32.64
And I was just confused.

1438
00:52:32.64 --> 00:52:33.60
Like, I don't even know where I am.

1439
00:52:33.60 --> 00:52:34.64
Can they pull you out of the game then?

1440
00:52:34.64 --> 00:52:35.16
Oh, yeah.

1441
00:52:35.16 --> 00:52:35.88
Because you were just done.

1442
00:52:35.88 --> 00:52:38.88
Everyone on the whole team knew I'm like,

1443
00:52:38.88 --> 00:52:40.88
Brad's kind of scary, to be honest with you.

1444
00:52:40.88 --> 00:52:42.44
Like, you don't know what's going on at all.

1445
00:52:42.44 --> 00:52:44.68
And oh, yeah, they knew because I had it the week before.

1446
00:52:44.68 --> 00:52:45.80
They pulled me out.

1447
00:52:45.80 --> 00:52:50.76
Well, Dean, you've taken some shots in your MMA career.

1448
00:52:50.76 --> 00:52:54.80
And you've never been knocked out in an MMA fight.

1449
00:52:54.80 --> 00:52:55.32
Rocked out.

1450
00:52:55.32 --> 00:52:55.76
I've been knocked out.

1451
00:52:55.76 --> 00:52:58.04
You've been knocked down, but you've never been knocked out.

1452
00:52:58.04 --> 00:53:01.88
I've watched some of your fights that I was actually at.

1453
00:53:01.88 --> 00:53:07.12
And I still can't believe that you didn't get KO'd to next month.

1454
00:53:07.12 --> 00:53:08.60
You're just like, oh, cool, whatever.

1455
00:53:08.60 --> 00:53:09.72
I'm going to keep fighting you.

1456
00:53:09.72 --> 00:53:13.000
That's the reason I don't look like Justin Bieber.

1457
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.52
I look a little bit different.

1458
00:53:16.52 --> 00:53:17.96
All right.

1459
00:53:17.96 --> 00:53:20.32
Let's be careful of traumatic brain injury.

1460
00:53:20.32 --> 00:53:21.000
Chokes.

1461
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:21.80
Next section on jokes.

1462
00:53:21.80 --> 00:53:26.36
Chokes are the most effective way to end a fight without a weapon.

1463
00:53:26.36 --> 00:53:28.20
They incapacitate an enemy.

1464
00:53:28.20 --> 00:53:31.000
With supervision, jokes can be applied in training exactly

1465
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.24
as a soldier would in the battlefield.

1466
00:53:33.24 --> 00:53:34.60
Great.

1467
00:53:34.60 --> 00:53:37.96
For training purposes, hold jokes only until your opponent taps.

1468
00:53:37.96 --> 00:53:41.12
Holding a choke for lengthy periods may cause injury or death.

1469
00:53:41.12 --> 00:53:42.36
OK.

1470
00:53:42.36 --> 00:53:46.48
So this is one of the things we're dealing with.

1471
00:53:46.48 --> 00:53:47.12
They have to say that.

1472
00:53:47.12 --> 00:53:48.72
They have to say that.

1473
00:53:48.72 --> 00:53:49.36
I know that's put.

1474
00:53:49.36 --> 00:53:50.48
We have to say what?

1475
00:53:50.48 --> 00:53:51.56
Like it could be injury.

1476
00:53:51.56 --> 00:53:54.72
If you hold someone asleep for five minutes,

1477
00:53:54.72 --> 00:53:57.40
but if someone goes to sleep, you let them go.

1478
00:53:57.40 --> 00:53:58.24
They'll wake up.

1479
00:53:58.24 --> 00:54:01.68
Now, there are certain substances that can actually

1480
00:54:01.68 --> 00:54:04.80
interact with certain organs that can be dangerous.

1481
00:54:04.80 --> 00:54:05.60
That's true.

1482
00:54:05.60 --> 00:54:09.56
If someone has a medical condition, never know.

1483
00:54:09.56 --> 00:54:13.96
But I swear, being choked out is safer than being knocked out.

1484
00:54:13.96 --> 00:54:15.20
Oh, it's not.

1485
00:54:15.20 --> 00:54:17.76
It's infinitely safer.

1486
00:54:17.76 --> 00:54:19.36
It's infinitely safer.

1487
00:54:19.36 --> 00:54:19.88
Now, if you have.

1488
00:54:19.88 --> 00:54:23.52
Being choked out is painless.

1489
00:54:23.52 --> 00:54:27.84
I would go so far as to say being choked out.

1490
00:54:27.84 --> 00:54:29.96
Has no negative impact on your health.

1491
00:54:29.96 --> 00:54:30.48
Yeah.

1492
00:54:30.48 --> 00:54:31.08
No.

1493
00:54:31.08 --> 00:54:33.000
Now, look, would you want to get choked out all day every day?

1494
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.20
No.

1495
00:54:33.20 --> 00:54:37.44
But if you get choked out, 30 seconds later,

1496
00:54:37.44 --> 00:54:42.96
you are totally viable to do anything that you need to do.

1497
00:54:42.96 --> 00:54:44.64
With no impairment whatsoever.

1498
00:54:44.64 --> 00:54:47.56
You get knocked out just like you said, Echo Charles.

1499
00:54:47.56 --> 00:54:52.04
If someone gets knocked out, you are messed up.

1500
00:54:52.04 --> 00:54:55.40
And you have probably some kind of permanent damage

1501
00:54:55.40 --> 00:54:57.12
to your brain.

1502
00:54:57.12 --> 00:54:58.08
Choked out?

1503
00:54:58.08 --> 00:55:00.16
No factors for it.

1504
00:55:00.16 --> 00:55:04.92
Would you compare being choked out to like your leg falling asleep?

1505
00:55:04.92 --> 00:55:06.88
I'm sure anatomically and physiologically,

1506
00:55:06.88 --> 00:55:07.72
there's a lot different.

1507
00:55:07.72 --> 00:55:08.92
But yeah, probably something.

1508
00:55:08.92 --> 00:55:10.08
You know, like your leg falls asleep.

1509
00:55:10.08 --> 00:55:12.000
You're like, oh, and then it comes back.

1510
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:12.96
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1511
00:55:12.96 --> 00:55:13.52
Then you're fine.

1512
00:55:13.52 --> 00:55:15.32
That's what it feels like to be honest.

1513
00:55:15.32 --> 00:55:20.56
Yeah, it's just it's horrible because law enforcement,

1514
00:55:20.56 --> 00:55:25.08
actually at this point, there's so many law enforcement departments

1515
00:55:25.08 --> 00:55:28.44
where the choke is illegal.

1516
00:55:28.44 --> 00:55:30.76
Yeah, it's the same as shooting someone out.

1517
00:55:30.76 --> 00:55:32.72
Yep, it's lethal force.

1518
00:55:32.72 --> 00:55:35.52
And you will be charged.

1519
00:55:35.52 --> 00:55:38.16
And when properly trained.

1520
00:55:38.16 --> 00:55:40.84
Now look, if someone's improperly trained,

1521
00:55:40.84 --> 00:55:43.52
there's a higher percentage that they might actually

1522
00:55:43.52 --> 00:55:44.20
hurt somebody.

1523
00:55:44.20 --> 00:55:45.88
True.

1524
00:55:45.88 --> 00:55:48.84
But anyone that's properly trained, I mean, please,

1525
00:55:48.84 --> 00:55:50.96
if you come to arrest me and I'm being a jerk

1526
00:55:50.96 --> 00:55:53.56
because I'm on drugs or drunk or whatever.

1527
00:55:53.56 --> 00:55:54.04
Choke me out.

1528
00:55:54.04 --> 00:55:54.84
Please choke me.

1529
00:55:54.84 --> 00:55:55.48
Don't shoot me.

1530
00:55:55.48 --> 00:55:58.88
Don't shoot me and don't beat me in the head with a baton,

1531
00:55:58.88 --> 00:55:59.88
right?

1532
00:55:59.88 --> 00:56:01.92
Because that's going to mess me up permanently.

1533
00:56:01.92 --> 00:56:04.24
Whereas you choke me out, you put me to sleep, put me in cuffs,

1534
00:56:04.24 --> 00:56:07.20
I'll wake up sober up and I'll be like, yeah, I'm sorry, man.

1535
00:56:07.20 --> 00:56:10.20
Whereas if you hit me in the head with a baton six times,

1536
00:56:10.20 --> 00:56:12.04
which is what it's going to take to knock me out,

1537
00:56:12.04 --> 00:56:13.40
I'm going to wake up.

1538
00:56:13.40 --> 00:56:14.64
I'm going to be messed up.

1539
00:56:14.64 --> 00:56:16.60
I'm going to have cuts all over my head.

1540
00:56:16.60 --> 00:56:17.20
Stitches, yeah.

1541
00:56:17.20 --> 00:56:21.000
Stitches, brain damage of some kind.

1542
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.28
I'm going to sue everybody.

1543
00:56:23.28 --> 00:56:26.000
I'm going to be, it's just a disaster.

1544
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.44
Where's he put me to sleep?

1545
00:56:27.44 --> 00:56:30.56
Last night on 99 Rear Naked Choke?

1546
00:56:30.56 --> 00:56:32.000
It's a terrible thing.

1547
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.08
It's a terrible thing that that's been demonized the way it has.

1548
00:56:36.08 --> 00:56:38.56
And look, there's been some cases where clearly it

1549
00:56:38.56 --> 00:56:41.56
was a freaking major problem because a chokehold got put on,

1550
00:56:41.56 --> 00:56:45.24
held for too long, put on by someone that was panicked

1551
00:56:45.24 --> 00:56:47.88
or otherwise freaking out.

1552
00:56:47.88 --> 00:56:51.52
And it was the wrong move to make and the training

1553
00:56:51.52 --> 00:56:53.68
wasn't there to let a person realize, oh,

1554
00:56:53.68 --> 00:56:54.76
this person's unconscious.

1555
00:56:54.76 --> 00:56:55.96
Now I need to let him go.

1556
00:56:55.96 --> 00:56:57.20
Yeah, true.

1557
00:56:57.20 --> 00:56:59.80
And no one was detached enough to be like, hey,

1558
00:56:59.80 --> 00:57:01.28
you that person's subdued.

1559
00:57:01.28 --> 00:57:02.12
Now you can let him go.

1560
00:57:05.76 --> 00:57:07.40
But that's jokes.

1561
00:57:07.40 --> 00:57:08.76
What did you write down to you?

1562
00:57:08.76 --> 00:57:11.40
No, I was just, I was saying like, you know,

1563
00:57:11.40 --> 00:57:16.16
about the illusions of, well, I mean, it's you see, you know,

1564
00:57:16.16 --> 00:57:18.68
so if you have me in a chokehold, I'll bite your arm

1565
00:57:18.68 --> 00:57:20.12
or I'll poke your eyes.

1566
00:57:20.12 --> 00:57:22.64
And truth is, you get a high level black belt

1567
00:57:22.64 --> 00:57:25.28
and they have a choke and try to actually start,

1568
00:57:25.28 --> 00:57:27.84
start with my arm in your mouth if you want.

1569
00:57:27.84 --> 00:57:32.04
Your teeth will, it won't shatter, but you will stop biting me.

1570
00:57:32.04 --> 00:57:33.24
Or you'll reach back from my eyes.

1571
00:57:33.24 --> 00:57:34.64
You have three seconds to go to sleep.

1572
00:57:34.64 --> 00:57:35.84
I can hide my eyes too.

1573
00:57:35.84 --> 00:57:37.44
And the eyes are not like jello.

1574
00:57:37.44 --> 00:57:40.72
I mean, they're very sensitive, but I mean,

1575
00:57:40.72 --> 00:57:43.68
it's just funny people think, oh, you know, that's your C.

1576
00:57:43.68 --> 00:57:45.32
We're gonna try to just reach back to focus eyes.

1577
00:57:45.32 --> 00:57:46.48
That's annoying.

1578
00:57:46.48 --> 00:57:47.52
It pissed me off actually.

1579
00:57:47.52 --> 00:57:48.96
You saw that video with Boss Rootin.

1580
00:57:48.96 --> 00:57:50.40
Yeah, you know, with the chokehold,

1581
00:57:50.40 --> 00:57:53.12
reach back from my eyes or reach for the groin.

1582
00:57:53.12 --> 00:57:55.08
So these are targets or opportunity.

1583
00:57:55.08 --> 00:57:57.60
You have to include that as a possibility, right?

1584
00:57:57.60 --> 00:57:59.84
But I'm saying like, just the thought of,

1585
00:57:59.84 --> 00:58:00.96
here's a quick ease, we have the choke,

1586
00:58:00.96 --> 00:58:01.96
just reach back for the eyes.

1587
00:58:01.96 --> 00:58:03.48
No, it's not that easy because if they know

1588
00:58:03.48 --> 00:58:04.32
what they're doing, they're squeezing,

1589
00:58:04.32 --> 00:58:05.96
you're taking three seconds, you're sleeping.

1590
00:58:05.96 --> 00:58:06.80
You're sleeping.

1591
00:58:06.80 --> 00:58:08.56
And you're not getting their eyes out in three seconds.

1592
00:58:08.56 --> 00:58:10.56
You might scratch your eyelid.

1593
00:58:10.56 --> 00:58:12.60
I've had people try to gouge my eyes out before

1594
00:58:12.60 --> 00:58:14.48
and it's ineffective compared to a choke.

1595
00:58:14.48 --> 00:58:15.32
They're going to sleep.

1596
00:58:15.32 --> 00:58:16.88
It'll kind of piss me off.

1597
00:58:16.88 --> 00:58:17.80
I choke you a little harder.

1598
00:58:17.80 --> 00:58:19.24
I choke harder.

1599
00:58:19.24 --> 00:58:20.88
Bite my arm right through your teeth.

1600
00:58:20.88 --> 00:58:21.84
You know, it's just stuff like that.

1601
00:58:21.84 --> 00:58:22.68
It sounds brutal.

1602
00:58:22.68 --> 00:58:24.12
It is brutal, but don't bite my arm.

1603
00:58:24.12 --> 00:58:24.96
You know what I'm saying?

1604
00:58:24.96 --> 00:58:26.84
So yeah, so that, so there's a happy medium

1605
00:58:26.84 --> 00:58:28.92
of including that as a possibility,

1606
00:58:28.92 --> 00:58:30.96
but not really, I don't think that that is a quick fix.

1607
00:58:30.96 --> 00:58:32.96
It's just something to include in your training.

1608
00:58:34.72 --> 00:58:37.44
Joint locks, attacks on most large joints,

1609
00:58:37.44 --> 00:58:40.64
for example, elbow, shoulder and knee are painful

1610
00:58:40.64 --> 00:58:42.000
long before causing injuries,

1611
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.36
which allows soldiers to conduct full force training

1612
00:58:45.36 --> 00:58:47.04
without significant risk of injury.

1613
00:58:47.04 --> 00:58:51.68
The exceptions are wrist attacks and twisting knee attacks.

1614
00:58:51.68 --> 00:58:54.48
Therefore these attacks should be taught with great care

1615
00:58:54.48 --> 00:58:57.88
and should not be allowed during sparring.

1616
00:58:57.88 --> 00:58:58.72
That's interesting.

1617
00:58:58.72 --> 00:59:00.76
Pete the Greek disagrees, 100%.

1618
00:59:00.76 --> 00:59:02.44
Yeah.

1619
00:59:02.44 --> 00:59:04.80
The way we do jockeau echo myself,

1620
00:59:04.80 --> 00:59:06.92
what they're talking about is something known as a told

1621
00:59:06.92 --> 00:59:10.52
or a heel look to twist your heel or your foot,

1622
00:59:10.52 --> 00:59:12.68
but the consequences of your knee twist usually depends

1623
00:59:12.68 --> 00:59:14.000
on if you have a strong knee and a weak ankle.

1624
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.80
Your ankle might pop first.

1625
00:59:15.80 --> 00:59:17.72
Now these kind of things done responsibly

1626
00:59:17.72 --> 00:59:20.04
can be done in training as long as you catch a release.

1627
00:59:20.04 --> 00:59:21.32
Also your partner has to know

1628
00:59:21.32 --> 00:59:22.92
and not turn the wrong way and hurt themselves.

1629
00:59:22.92 --> 00:59:24.24
So I think they should be included in training,

1630
00:59:24.24 --> 00:59:25.64
but I see a white belt, you know,

1631
00:59:25.64 --> 00:59:28.000
teaching my heel look can go hard because yeah,

1632
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.28
with a boot on a military boot,

1633
00:59:29.28 --> 00:59:30.28
you can just grab the boot and twist it.

1634
00:59:30.28 --> 00:59:31.40
You don't need to get a heel look, you know,

1635
00:59:31.40 --> 00:59:32.44
they can just grab your boot.

1636
00:59:32.44 --> 00:59:35.20
So with the boots on, leg lock city, bro.

1637
00:59:35.20 --> 00:59:36.04
Yeah.

1638
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.08
It is with heel hooks,

1639
00:59:40.08 --> 00:59:42.76
heel hooks do not hurt until you're injured.

1640
00:59:42.76 --> 00:59:43.60
Right at the edge, yeah.

1641
00:59:43.60 --> 00:59:44.44
Yeah, right at the edge.

1642
00:59:44.44 --> 00:59:49.44
Right, but I actually hurt someone with a heel hook.

1643
00:59:50.04 --> 00:59:53.92
I was a blue belt and I was training with a friend of mine

1644
00:59:53.92 --> 00:59:56.40
who's a seal, who's all amped up

1645
00:59:57.32 --> 01:00:00.40
and I put a heel hook on and I did,

1646
01:00:00.40 --> 01:00:02.76
I put it on to a point where I was like,

1647
01:00:02.76 --> 01:00:06.64
oh, you know, whatever, he's not tapping

1648
01:00:06.64 --> 01:00:08.32
and I think I just like let it go or whatever,

1649
01:00:08.32 --> 01:00:09.80
but it hurt him.

1650
01:00:09.80 --> 01:00:12.52
So, and he didn't really feel the pain from it.

1651
01:00:12.52 --> 01:00:14.08
I went to something else.

1652
01:00:14.08 --> 01:00:17.56
So it is a thing and you do need to pay attention to that,

1653
01:00:17.56 --> 01:00:20.80
that heel hooks really don't hurt that much

1654
01:00:20.80 --> 01:00:22.12
until you're injured.

1655
01:00:25.20 --> 01:00:26.60
Wrist locks.

1656
01:00:26.60 --> 01:00:27.44
Yeah, there's also that.

1657
01:00:27.44 --> 01:00:28.44
That's weird.

1658
01:00:28.44 --> 01:00:31.04
I don't know why, is that included?

1659
01:00:31.04 --> 01:00:32.24
There's many bones in the, you know,

1660
01:00:32.24 --> 01:00:33.88
the hand is, it's all these bones together

1661
01:00:33.88 --> 01:00:37.32
and there's certain little pop could be this one bone

1662
01:00:37.32 --> 01:00:38.92
and this one, this one little, like,

1663
01:00:38.92 --> 01:00:40.36
Dr. Luke would, you know,

1664
01:00:40.36 --> 01:00:42.48
has over the hands, human hand, obviously,

1665
01:00:42.48 --> 01:00:44.32
but it could be this little knuckle,

1666
01:00:44.32 --> 01:00:46.24
it could be the finger, you get me,

1667
01:00:46.24 --> 01:00:47.56
it could be that finger, it could be,

1668
01:00:47.56 --> 01:00:50.52
so a little pressure could pop a finger.

1669
01:00:50.52 --> 01:00:52.04
Yeah, so that's what they mean.

1670
01:00:52.04 --> 01:00:52.88
They are effective though,

1671
01:00:52.88 --> 01:00:55.52
there's some really effective wrist locks.

1672
01:00:55.52 --> 01:00:56.72
Generally speaking on the ground,

1673
01:00:56.72 --> 01:00:59.16
there's not a lot of very effective standing wrist locks

1674
01:00:59.16 --> 01:01:00.40
against a trained opponent at least.

1675
01:01:00.40 --> 01:01:01.24
Because there's the,

1676
01:01:01.24 --> 01:01:02.60
because the opponent has a lot of mobility.

1677
01:01:02.60 --> 01:01:05.000
Yes, yes, you need to isolate one of the major limbs,

1678
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.48
the neck or one of the arms.

1679
01:01:06.48 --> 01:01:08.08
So you control next to the trunk of the body,

1680
01:01:08.08 --> 01:01:08.92
is what I'm saying.

1681
01:01:08.92 --> 01:01:09.76
Yeah.

1682
01:01:09.76 --> 01:01:12.08
You know how like the heel hook, right?

1683
01:01:12.08 --> 01:01:13.84
You don't really feel it until like,

1684
01:01:13.84 --> 01:01:15.20
kind of too late scenario, right?

1685
01:01:15.20 --> 01:01:16.16
What about knee bars?

1686
01:01:16.16 --> 01:01:18.16
In your experience, same deal?

1687
01:01:18.16 --> 01:01:20.68
Kimura is worse than a straight knee lock.

1688
01:01:20.68 --> 01:01:21.80
Kimura is what the pain.

1689
01:01:21.80 --> 01:01:23.52
The twisting, the twisting motion,

1690
01:01:23.52 --> 01:01:25.32
if you're, if you're on bops in a Kimura,

1691
01:01:25.32 --> 01:01:26.36
it could be a problem.

1692
01:01:26.36 --> 01:01:28.32
If your knee pops from a straight, I mean,

1693
01:01:28.32 --> 01:01:29.60
you know, you'd be sore.

1694
01:01:29.60 --> 01:01:31.76
Now, if you don't tap at all and it does break,

1695
01:01:31.76 --> 01:01:32.96
and then it's of course serious injury,

1696
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:34.56
but the straight knee lock,

1697
01:01:34.56 --> 01:01:35.84
you feel the pain right away.

1698
01:01:35.84 --> 01:01:37.44
But your question about the pain level.

1699
01:01:37.44 --> 01:01:38.28
Yeah, exactly, right?

1700
01:01:38.28 --> 01:01:40.36
The pain level in a straight knee lock is there.

1701
01:01:40.36 --> 01:01:41.20
Yeah, for sure.

1702
01:01:41.20 --> 01:01:42.68
You don't tap, yeah.

1703
01:01:42.68 --> 01:01:45.44
I've had my knee pop from a knee bar,

1704
01:01:45.44 --> 01:01:47.24
didn't feel it, even when it popped,

1705
01:01:47.24 --> 01:01:48.84
I didn't really feel it that much.

1706
01:01:48.84 --> 01:01:50.08
I knew there was something wrong.

1707
01:01:50.08 --> 01:01:50.92
You're so athletic.

1708
01:01:50.92 --> 01:01:52.40
Seriously, running your whole life,

1709
01:01:52.40 --> 01:01:53.96
maybe that's the reason, running, running, running,

1710
01:01:53.96 --> 01:01:55.56
you lose a lot of the nerves in your knee.

1711
01:01:55.56 --> 01:01:57.16
Yeah, it's very possible, yes.

1712
01:01:57.16 --> 01:01:58.000
Cause it did swell up.

1713
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.32
I didn't like, I didn't.

1714
01:01:59.32 --> 01:02:01.40
I was gonna say, was it actually injured though?

1715
01:02:01.40 --> 01:02:02.24
It was like,

1716
01:02:02.24 --> 01:02:04.60
cause you have those weird knees too that sometimes make a noise

1717
01:02:04.60 --> 01:02:05.44
for no reason.

1718
01:02:05.44 --> 01:02:06.96
They pop out, yeah.

1719
01:02:06.96 --> 01:02:08.08
Yeah, and that's a good point.

1720
01:02:08.08 --> 01:02:10.56
It probably was that, it was swollen for,

1721
01:02:10.56 --> 01:02:12.40
I don't know, a week, two weeks maybe,

1722
01:02:12.40 --> 01:02:14.72
which actually technically as far as compared to a real knee

1723
01:02:14.72 --> 01:02:16.68
injury is not that much time, I don't know.

1724
01:02:16.68 --> 01:02:18.64
So was I injured?

1725
01:02:18.64 --> 01:02:20.20
Moderately injured.

1726
01:02:20.20 --> 01:02:21.20
But it did swell up,

1727
01:02:21.20 --> 01:02:23.52
and I think it was just a meniscus situation.

1728
01:02:23.52 --> 01:02:25.40
But I didn't feel it though.

1729
01:02:25.40 --> 01:02:26.24
It wasn't painful.

1730
01:02:26.24 --> 01:02:27.08
That's strange.

1731
01:02:27.08 --> 01:02:29.20
So yeah, it could be like a unique thing.

1732
01:02:29.20 --> 01:02:30.52
Like I'm sure with the arm lock,

1733
01:02:30.52 --> 01:02:31.72
that next day the arms swell up,

1734
01:02:31.72 --> 01:02:32.68
then it tap, yeah.

1735
01:02:32.68 --> 01:02:33.72
But the knee is a little more serious,

1736
01:02:33.72 --> 01:02:34.92
but it's not as bad as a Kimura.

1737
01:02:34.92 --> 01:02:37.20
A Kimura, if you get an injury from a Kimura,

1738
01:02:37.20 --> 01:02:39.64
it's a little worse than a straight knee lock, generally.

1739
01:02:39.64 --> 01:02:40.60
Twisting, your look is different.

1740
01:02:40.60 --> 01:02:44.16
Yeah, well your shoulders are more complex, joint.

1741
01:02:44.16 --> 01:02:45.000
Twisting.

1742
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.84
What have you, you got knee surgeries pretty early.

1743
01:02:48.84 --> 01:02:49.68
Yeah.

1744
01:02:49.68 --> 01:02:50.52
Didn't you Dean Lister?

1745
01:02:50.52 --> 01:02:51.52
97 and 2001.

1746
01:02:51.52 --> 01:02:52.88
How old were you?

1747
01:02:52.88 --> 01:02:55.12
I must have been 20, 21.

1748
01:02:55.12 --> 01:02:57.04
And what was the first injury?

1749
01:02:57.04 --> 01:02:58.72
It was from high school football.

1750
01:02:58.72 --> 01:02:59.96
I got hit from the side.

1751
01:02:59.96 --> 01:03:01.84
My knee was on, someone was on there,

1752
01:03:01.84 --> 01:03:03.08
like they already got knocked down.

1753
01:03:03.08 --> 01:03:04.04
They were on their hands and knees,

1754
01:03:04.04 --> 01:03:06.40
and my knee got propped up against the ribs.

1755
01:03:06.40 --> 01:03:07.24
I didn't see them.

1756
01:03:07.24 --> 01:03:09.44
I'm pursuing down line, I was a linebacker.

1757
01:03:09.44 --> 01:03:10.88
And so I hit from the right side,

1758
01:03:10.88 --> 01:03:12.76
and I twisted over, just perfect.

1759
01:03:12.76 --> 01:03:13.92
You know, I didn't see the guy.

1760
01:03:13.92 --> 01:03:16.24
I saw the video, my knee planted on his side,

1761
01:03:16.24 --> 01:03:17.24
and I got hit from the right.

1762
01:03:17.24 --> 01:03:18.48
It just popped right over.

1763
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:19.84
So was it, oh, ACL?

1764
01:03:19.84 --> 01:03:23.08
ACL, the LCL, and the meniscus medial,

1765
01:03:23.08 --> 01:03:24.40
or the medial, or a lot of other meniscus.

1766
01:03:24.40 --> 01:03:26.44
So you got the triple front surgery?

1767
01:03:26.44 --> 01:03:28.88
Bucket handle, Terry, that's what they call it.

1768
01:03:28.88 --> 01:03:29.88
But yeah.

1769
01:03:29.88 --> 01:03:31.88
And then the doctor was like, yeah, knee surgery,

1770
01:03:31.88 --> 01:03:33.72
but you have a strong knee capsule.

1771
01:03:33.72 --> 01:03:34.56
I'm like, what does that mean?

1772
01:03:34.56 --> 01:03:36.08
Well, right now you're okay kind of,

1773
01:03:36.08 --> 01:03:37.84
but that eventually just came out.

1774
01:03:37.84 --> 01:03:39.32
James Nielsen had a triangle.

1775
01:03:39.32 --> 01:03:43.28
I was in a full squat, just came out one time on the mat in 97,

1776
01:03:43.28 --> 01:03:44.12
and then I got surgery.

1777
01:03:44.12 --> 01:03:45.48
And then you got the needed surgery.

1778
01:03:45.48 --> 01:03:49.28
I always kind of forgot that you got surgery in 97,

1779
01:03:49.28 --> 01:03:52.24
and that most of your career was post knee surgery.

1780
01:03:52.24 --> 01:03:53.84
And I think I shot off the Ron Bergen for,

1781
01:03:53.84 --> 01:03:54.84
I had an appointment for them,

1782
01:03:54.84 --> 01:03:57.80
and my insurance lapsed just like a week after that.

1783
01:03:57.80 --> 01:03:59.12
So I had full.

1784
01:03:59.12 --> 01:04:00.52
Yeah, sweet.

1785
01:04:00.52 --> 01:04:02.44
So I got, yeah, thanks to Ron Bergen, my friend.

1786
01:04:02.44 --> 01:04:04.40
Yeah, he took the job.

1787
01:04:04.40 --> 01:04:05.36
You got lucky on that one.

1788
01:04:05.36 --> 01:04:07.08
Lucky, that's a expensive thing.

1789
01:04:07.08 --> 01:04:09.84
Yeah, and then you got another one in 2001?

1790
01:04:09.84 --> 01:04:11.64
Yeah, but that was just a meniscus.

1791
01:04:11.64 --> 01:04:13.52
That's just a shaving, yeah, meniscus.

1792
01:04:13.52 --> 01:04:16.56
2001, 2003 was a good year for me in Brazil.

1793
01:04:16.56 --> 01:04:18.84
2001, I was, you know, three weeks,

1794
01:04:18.84 --> 01:04:19.84
mdm'd up, not a big deal.

1795
01:04:19.84 --> 01:04:22.40
And then you got shoulder surgery.

1796
01:04:22.40 --> 01:04:24.60
Shoulder surgery, I had five solo surgeries

1797
01:04:24.60 --> 01:04:27.12
in a year and a half, yeah.

1798
01:04:27.12 --> 01:04:28.12
That's not fun.

1799
01:04:28.12 --> 01:04:29.80
Because I had an infection in Brazil,

1800
01:04:29.80 --> 01:04:32.40
in that Brazil, I have an infection, you know?

1801
01:04:32.40 --> 01:04:33.76
A really bad, serious infection.

1802
01:04:33.76 --> 01:04:35.12
Like they were even saying in Portuguese,

1803
01:04:35.12 --> 01:04:37.40
like, hey, we're not saying you might get your arm cut off,

1804
01:04:37.40 --> 01:04:38.92
but you know, it could happen.

1805
01:04:38.92 --> 01:04:41.32
I'm like, bro, when a doctor says,

1806
01:04:41.32 --> 01:04:42.48
yeah, that's bad.

1807
01:04:42.48 --> 01:04:44.52
They're kind of like, but they're telling you for a reason.

1808
01:04:44.52 --> 01:04:45.52
So, yeah.

1809
01:04:45.52 --> 01:04:46.88
So, yeah, but I think I'm actually.

1810
01:04:46.88 --> 01:04:47.72
What surgery was that?

1811
01:04:47.72 --> 01:04:49.28
Like the original problem, what was it?

1812
01:04:49.28 --> 01:04:52.96
It was my medial, my infraspinatus,

1813
01:04:52.96 --> 01:04:55.64
my sub scapularis, and my labrum and my rototocuff,

1814
01:04:55.64 --> 01:04:58.24
which was all ripped up from all the competitions I've had.

1815
01:04:58.24 --> 01:05:01.84
Also in Russia, broke, broken Russia, snapped.

1816
01:05:01.84 --> 01:05:02.68
That's just a bad arm.

1817
01:05:02.68 --> 01:05:04.000
That's all, but it's okay, right?

1818
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.16
Surgery's happy.

1819
01:05:05.16 --> 01:05:08.48
We have a lot of overlapping injuries.

1820
01:05:08.48 --> 01:05:11.44
Even actually, I tore my knee,

1821
01:05:11.44 --> 01:05:14.76
kind of real similar in a similar way the year before.

1822
01:05:14.76 --> 01:05:15.72
96, yeah?

1823
01:05:15.72 --> 01:05:17.12
Football, same deal.

1824
01:05:17.12 --> 01:05:18.40
And you're bicep too?

1825
01:05:18.40 --> 01:05:19.24
Yeah, the bicep.

1826
01:05:19.24 --> 01:05:22.44
In fact, one of our surgeries was on the same day.

1827
01:05:22.44 --> 01:05:23.56
We ran into each other.

1828
01:05:23.56 --> 01:05:24.40
Did you know that?

1829
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:26.64
Yeah, I go in for the surgery.

1830
01:05:26.64 --> 01:05:28.24
And the doctor's like, oh yeah, Dean's here.

1831
01:05:28.24 --> 01:05:29.08
I was like, what?

1832
01:05:29.08 --> 01:05:31.08
And then he's like coming to after his surgery.

1833
01:05:31.08 --> 01:05:32.16
He's like, wait, who was the doctor?

1834
01:05:32.16 --> 01:05:33.48
Were he like, do you guys?

1835
01:05:33.48 --> 01:05:38.000
Well, yeah, because you said, when I first tore my bicep,

1836
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.44
it was after you tore yours.

1837
01:05:39.44 --> 01:05:40.68
It was at a different time.

1838
01:05:40.68 --> 01:05:43.48
So when I tore mine, I was like, hey, who's your guy?

1839
01:05:43.48 --> 01:05:44.72
Like who did you go to?

1840
01:05:44.72 --> 01:05:46.48
Because he was back in the game.

1841
01:05:46.48 --> 01:05:48.000
So I was like, let me go to that guy.

1842
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.12
So it was Norman Cain.

1843
01:05:49.12 --> 01:05:49.96
Yeah, that's right.

1844
01:05:49.96 --> 01:05:52.52
And so I went to him and then he passed me up.

1845
01:05:52.52 --> 01:05:54.08
He's like, oh, Dean's here?

1846
01:05:54.08 --> 01:05:55.40
No, no, no, that was the first one.

1847
01:05:55.40 --> 01:05:58.56
The second, or when I ran into him was the second one.

1848
01:05:58.56 --> 01:05:59.68
What if I'm being real?

1849
01:05:59.68 --> 01:06:01.04
I'm like, yeah, go, don't do it.

1850
01:06:01.04 --> 01:06:01.88
Don't trust him.

1851
01:06:01.88 --> 01:06:04.32
I would have trusted him if I was you.

1852
01:06:04.32 --> 01:06:06.28
You've only torn one bicep, haven't you, Dean?

1853
01:06:06.28 --> 01:06:08.76
Oh, well, yeah, it was complete tear, though.

1854
01:06:08.76 --> 01:06:09.60
Just rolled up my shoulder.

1855
01:06:09.60 --> 01:06:11.12
You were there when that rolled up my shoulder.

1856
01:06:11.12 --> 01:06:11.96
I was there too.

1857
01:06:11.96 --> 01:06:12.80
I had two shoulders.

1858
01:06:12.80 --> 01:06:13.64
No bicep.

1859
01:06:13.64 --> 01:06:14.48
You were two shoulders.

1860
01:06:14.48 --> 01:06:15.32
I'm just being a bit rude.

1861
01:06:15.32 --> 01:06:17.000
I remember Robert Garcia, we were back together.

1862
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.20
I was like, I don't know, but yeah, that's bad surgery.

1863
01:06:21.20 --> 01:06:23.76
But the second one, it was like nine years later

1864
01:06:23.76 --> 01:06:26.44
when you got your other surgery on your shoulder bicep.

1865
01:06:26.44 --> 01:06:29.08
It was like, he had a big surgery.

1866
01:06:29.08 --> 01:06:31.08
So I went and Norman Cain did yours, right?

1867
01:06:31.08 --> 01:06:31.92
That one.

1868
01:06:31.92 --> 01:06:33.08
But I didn't get it from Norman.

1869
01:06:33.08 --> 01:06:33.92
Norman Cain didn't do mine.

1870
01:06:33.92 --> 01:06:34.76
It was the other guy.

1871
01:06:34.76 --> 01:06:37.24
It was like his partner guy or whatever.

1872
01:06:37.24 --> 01:06:39.52
But I saw that's who told me when I walked in,

1873
01:06:39.52 --> 01:06:42.08
it was Norman Cain and he was like, oh, what's up, man?

1874
01:06:42.08 --> 01:06:42.92
Dean's here.

1875
01:06:42.92 --> 01:06:44.92
And he was like, no, we finished already.

1876
01:06:44.92 --> 01:06:47.80
So then he's like, you know when you come.

1877
01:06:47.80 --> 01:06:49.72
That's a bad sign for Jiu-Jitsu when you let go

1878
01:06:49.72 --> 01:06:51.28
to get surgery and your other friends

1879
01:06:51.28 --> 01:06:52.60
or they're getting surgery as well.

1880
01:06:52.60 --> 01:06:53.60
Another guy's there too.

1881
01:06:53.60 --> 01:06:55.32
Yeah, not a good sign.

1882
01:06:55.32 --> 01:06:58.20
100% Rika, how is your arm?

1883
01:06:58.20 --> 01:06:59.04
It's getting strong.

1884
01:06:59.04 --> 01:07:01.72
It's rehab and progress, you know, so I'll be okay.

1885
01:07:04.36 --> 01:07:05.40
Yeah, check.

1886
01:07:06.92 --> 01:07:07.96
It actually has a protocol.

1887
01:07:07.96 --> 01:07:09.24
Like I said, the army doesn't miss anything.

1888
01:07:09.24 --> 01:07:11.000
Protocol for injured soldiers.

1889
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.92
You know, it's got everything in here.

1890
01:07:13.92 --> 01:07:16.80
It also says that striking is not the most efficient way

1891
01:07:16.80 --> 01:07:19.56
to incapacitate an enemy and often results

1892
01:07:19.56 --> 01:07:21.20
in injury to the striker.

1893
01:07:22.92 --> 01:07:25.04
So this is like a pro grappling statement.

1894
01:07:25.04 --> 01:07:27.04
Not only is it not the most efficient way,

1895
01:07:27.04 --> 01:07:28.84
but I'm probably gonna get hurt too.

1896
01:07:28.84 --> 01:07:31.24
Choco, the old school boxers, apparently,

1897
01:07:31.24 --> 01:07:33.52
no gloves would punch the body more.

1898
01:07:33.52 --> 01:07:34.64
That's why the hands were done here.

1899
01:07:34.64 --> 01:07:36.92
Because punching the forehead back in those days,

1900
01:07:36.92 --> 01:07:39.32
your hands broken now, you're like, eh,

1901
01:07:39.32 --> 01:07:40.48
you know, probably retired now.

1902
01:07:40.48 --> 01:07:44.000
Or you're not gonna go into the job at the factory now.

1903
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.96
These guys actually worked at the time.

1904
01:07:45.96 --> 01:07:47.88
So the rumor, actually, I don't remember,

1905
01:07:47.88 --> 01:07:49.96
pretty much known with the 1800s.

1906
01:07:49.96 --> 01:07:50.88
It was like the hands were low

1907
01:07:50.88 --> 01:07:52.44
because you were punching more of the body.

1908
01:07:52.44 --> 01:07:54.68
Face, yeah, but you're taking a chance to the face.

1909
01:07:54.68 --> 01:07:55.80
So there we go.

1910
01:07:55.80 --> 01:07:57.08
I mean, they knew it back and then they didn't have

1911
01:07:57.08 --> 01:07:58.28
the same medical care we do now.

1912
01:07:58.28 --> 01:08:01.24
And there's reason they were hands low.

1913
01:08:01.24 --> 01:08:02.80
Yeah, they actually keep them in,

1914
01:08:02.80 --> 01:08:03.84
tucked to their sides a little bit.

1915
01:08:03.84 --> 01:08:05.16
They'll prevent those body shots.

1916
01:08:05.16 --> 01:08:07.28
And yet further out in front of them,

1917
01:08:07.28 --> 01:08:09.84
so they maybe can get up and defend the face a little bit

1918
01:08:09.84 --> 01:08:10.84
if they need to.

1919
01:08:10.84 --> 01:08:11.84
That's interesting.

1920
01:08:13.76 --> 01:08:15.32
It does say however striking is important part

1921
01:08:15.32 --> 01:08:16.88
of overall strife fight strategy,

1922
01:08:16.88 --> 01:08:19.24
strikes can be very effective in manipulating the opponent

1923
01:08:19.24 --> 01:08:20.60
into unfavorable positions.

1924
01:08:20.60 --> 01:08:21.44
Striking can be practiced

1925
01:08:21.44 --> 01:08:22.72
with various types of protective padding,

1926
01:08:22.72 --> 01:08:23.96
such as gloves.

1927
01:08:23.96 --> 01:08:26.24
Defense can be practiced using reduced force blows.

1928
01:08:26.24 --> 01:08:28.76
So there you go.

1929
01:08:28.76 --> 01:08:31.20
Talks about like, I mean,

1930
01:08:31.20 --> 01:08:34.08
this is such a detailed document

1931
01:08:34.08 --> 01:08:35.32
and the army just does this, man.

1932
01:08:35.32 --> 01:08:37.12
The army is squared away when it comes to doctrine.

1933
01:08:37.12 --> 01:08:40.92
They make them just incredibly detailed things

1934
01:08:40.92 --> 01:08:44.60
and this team obviously put a huge amount into this.

1935
01:08:46.32 --> 01:08:47.68
Talking about training.

1936
01:08:48.72 --> 01:08:51.56
The military profession is inherently dangerous.

1937
01:08:51.56 --> 01:08:53.64
Commanders must train their units to tough standards

1938
01:08:53.64 --> 01:08:56.24
under the most realistic conditions possible.

1939
01:08:58.40 --> 01:09:01.44
This chapter discusses the combatives training program

1940
01:09:01.44 --> 01:09:05.08
from an institutional training to operational unit training,

1941
01:09:05.08 --> 01:09:07.76
training areas, training techniques, teaching techniques

1942
01:09:07.76 --> 01:09:09.40
and safety precautions that must be considered

1943
01:09:09.40 --> 01:09:10.88
before conducting combatives training.

1944
01:09:10.88 --> 01:09:14.28
And they just go, they get after it in this thing.

1945
01:09:14.28 --> 01:09:18.000
I mean, this is like, if you didn't know anything

1946
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.08
about anything, you could pick up this manual

1947
01:09:20.08 --> 01:09:22.60
and start to piece together, you know?

1948
01:09:22.60 --> 01:09:25.36
Deliberate work risk assessment worksheet.

1949
01:09:25.36 --> 01:09:27.20
It is vital to identify necessary risk

1950
01:09:27.20 --> 01:09:29.52
by comparing potential benefit to potential loss.

1951
01:09:29.52 --> 01:09:31.48
The draw process allows units to identify

1952
01:09:31.48 --> 01:09:33.64
and control hazards, conserve combat power

1953
01:09:33.64 --> 01:09:35.40
and resources and complete the mission.

1954
01:09:35.40 --> 01:09:37.68
This process is cyclic and continuous.

1955
01:09:37.68 --> 01:09:39.32
It must be integrated into all phases

1956
01:09:39.32 --> 01:09:41.08
of operations and training.

1957
01:09:41.08 --> 01:09:42.28
Like these guys are just,

1958
01:09:42.28 --> 01:09:44.40
they're not even playing around with us.

1959
01:09:44.40 --> 01:09:45.96
And then go, what do you got, Dean?

1960
01:09:45.96 --> 01:09:47.28
No, I was just saying, like,

1961
01:09:47.28 --> 01:09:48.40
I like how this is structured.

1962
01:09:48.40 --> 01:09:50.44
I really like it a lot because you need to have a guideline

1963
01:09:50.44 --> 01:09:51.28
especially in the military.

1964
01:09:51.28 --> 01:09:52.12
I think it's really good.

1965
01:09:52.12 --> 01:09:53.24
You're doing a good job so far.

1966
01:09:53.24 --> 01:09:54.72
For us, they're very complete.

1967
01:09:54.72 --> 01:09:56.28
One thing that I think is very important

1968
01:09:56.28 --> 01:09:57.52
as far as training on your own,

1969
01:09:57.52 --> 01:09:59.72
if you're in the military or if you're under

1970
01:09:59.72 --> 01:10:01.48
some certain guidance like this is,

1971
01:10:01.48 --> 01:10:03.56
there has to be some wiggle room, some leeway,

1972
01:10:03.56 --> 01:10:06.68
such as also a move that I don't even do that well,

1973
01:10:06.68 --> 01:10:08.24
but I know my students do well.

1974
01:10:08.24 --> 01:10:11.36
Like, remember, Eric had a better darsen than me.

1975
01:10:11.36 --> 01:10:12.72
Maybe I taught at them though.

1976
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:14.96
So there's certain things I'll teach

1977
01:10:14.96 --> 01:10:16.60
that would not be under my guideline,

1978
01:10:16.60 --> 01:10:19.12
but I teach because some people do those moves naturally well.

1979
01:10:19.12 --> 01:10:20.52
Some people I wouldn't strive,

1980
01:10:20.52 --> 01:10:22.10
I wouldn't teach, I'll teach in the triangle,

1981
01:10:22.10 --> 01:10:23.68
but that's it, the legs are not very long.

1982
01:10:23.68 --> 01:10:24.56
It's not gonna be their main move,

1983
01:10:24.56 --> 01:10:25.68
but they don't learn it anyways.

1984
01:10:25.68 --> 01:10:28.04
Someone else is gonna be, that's gonna be their move.

1985
01:10:28.04 --> 01:10:29.80
So I think it's really important we have the guideline,

1986
01:10:29.80 --> 01:10:31.28
but there's also has to be some wiggle room.

1987
01:10:31.28 --> 01:10:34.24
That's why it's important to train in your own free time

1988
01:10:34.24 --> 01:10:35.40
to find your own style.

1989
01:10:35.40 --> 01:10:37.52
I think it's really important for Jiu-Jitsu.

1990
01:10:37.52 --> 01:10:40.48
Yeah, you don't wanna learn by the book only.

1991
01:10:40.48 --> 01:10:41.36
It's good to have guidelines.

1992
01:10:41.36 --> 01:10:42.48
Yeah, it's gotta have the guidelines,

1993
01:10:42.48 --> 01:10:43.32
but you gotta get out there.

1994
01:10:43.32 --> 01:10:44.60
I think it goes through the whole thing

1995
01:10:44.60 --> 01:10:47.36
of like how the basic combatives course of instruction,

1996
01:10:47.36 --> 01:10:50.60
there's a BCC instruction and what that does

1997
01:10:50.60 --> 01:10:52.60
and what that includes.

1998
01:10:52.60 --> 01:10:54.24
And then tactical combatives course

1999
01:10:54.24 --> 01:10:56.32
and what that's all about and what that includes.

2000
01:10:56.32 --> 01:10:59.52
And then you get them combatives master trainer course

2001
01:10:59.52 --> 01:11:02.68
of instruction, the CMTC.

2002
01:11:03.96 --> 01:11:05.52
This addresses all ranges of the fight

2003
01:11:05.52 --> 01:11:07.56
by training striking skills and introduces soldiers

2004
01:11:07.56 --> 01:11:09.96
to the integrating combatives training

2005
01:11:09.96 --> 01:11:12.88
into the rest of their warrior tasks and drills,

2006
01:11:12.88 --> 01:11:15.68
IE incorporating combatives into training,

2007
01:11:15.68 --> 01:11:18.84
close quarters combat training and mission unit training.

2008
01:11:18.84 --> 01:11:23.16
And then it goes over duties of the combatives

2009
01:11:23.16 --> 01:11:26.36
master trainer course certified instructors.

2010
01:11:27.52 --> 01:11:29.84
And it says everything that they have to do.

2011
01:11:29.84 --> 01:11:32.72
And there's a whole list of things that they have to do

2012
01:11:32.72 --> 01:11:36.36
to be like a master trainer in this stuff.

2013
01:11:36.36 --> 01:11:41.16
They went to great lengths to get this program.

2014
01:11:41.16 --> 01:11:44.96
And you know, a lot of this, I bet was they,

2015
01:11:46.92 --> 01:11:48.68
you gotta play the game in the military.

2016
01:11:48.68 --> 01:11:50.28
You know, you gotta play the game.

2017
01:11:50.28 --> 01:11:52.48
You gotta give the leadership what it is

2018
01:11:52.48 --> 01:11:56.16
that they need to say, yeah, we, yep.

2019
01:11:56.16 --> 01:11:59.36
Oh, this is, I bet you they pulled out like some

2020
01:11:59.36 --> 01:12:01.60
immediate action drill rifle training guidebook

2021
01:12:01.60 --> 01:12:03.04
and said, all right, we're gonna put all the stuff

2022
01:12:03.04 --> 01:12:05.20
that's in here about safety, we're gonna put it in here.

2023
01:12:05.20 --> 01:12:08.18
And they did an awesome job of setting this up

2024
01:12:08.18 --> 01:12:10.76
where it's kind of hard, hard for the leadership

2025
01:12:10.76 --> 01:12:12.56
to say, well, you guys really haven't fought this through.

2026
01:12:12.56 --> 01:12:14.60
It's like, oh no, we fought this through

2027
01:12:14.60 --> 01:12:16.72
to the freaking nth degree.

2028
01:12:16.72 --> 01:12:18.92
Yeah, here's some of the stuff

2029
01:12:18.92 --> 01:12:23.92
that the combatives instructor has to do.

2030
01:12:23.92 --> 01:12:25.44
Receive at least 20 hours of instruction,

2031
01:12:25.44 --> 01:12:26.96
gain the ability to teach basic combatives

2032
01:12:26.96 --> 01:12:28.32
and develop scenario-based training

2033
01:12:28.32 --> 01:12:30.28
and understand standard competition roles.

2034
01:12:30.28 --> 01:12:33.12
Pass a hands-on performance-oriented test

2035
01:12:33.12 --> 01:12:35.84
on basic combatives techniques,

2036
01:12:35.84 --> 01:12:37.52
including the following maneuvers.

2037
01:12:37.52 --> 01:12:39.94
Escape the mount, trap and roll, pass the guard,

2038
01:12:39.94 --> 01:12:42.20
achieve mount from side control, arm push and roll

2039
01:12:42.20 --> 01:12:44.60
to the rear mount, escape rear mount, escape the mount,

2040
01:12:44.60 --> 01:12:46.68
shrimp to the guard, scissor sweep, rear naked choke,

2041
01:12:46.68 --> 01:12:48.44
cross collar choke from the mount or guard,

2042
01:12:48.44 --> 01:12:50.72
bend arm bar, straight arm bar from the guard,

2043
01:12:50.72 --> 01:12:54.32
straight arm bar from the mount, sweep and attempt

2044
01:12:54.32 --> 01:12:56.04
the straight arm, sweep from the attempted

2045
01:12:56.04 --> 01:12:58.16
straight arm bar, close the gap and achieve the clinch,

2046
01:12:58.16 --> 01:13:01.40
take down from the front to the mount, rear take down,

2047
01:13:01.40 --> 01:13:03.16
front guillotine choke.

2048
01:13:03.16 --> 01:13:05.16
Guillotine choke, sorry.

2049
01:13:05.16 --> 01:13:06.60
Guillotine.

2050
01:13:06.60 --> 01:13:07.48
Guillotine, poor.

2051
01:13:07.48 --> 01:13:10.60
Pass a written exam on the combatives program

2052
01:13:10.60 --> 01:13:13.60
and standard combatives rules,

2053
01:13:13.60 --> 01:13:17.24
conduct at least one scenario-based training exercise

2054
01:13:17.24 --> 01:13:18.88
and receive an additional 20-hour training.

2055
01:13:18.88 --> 01:13:21.88
So they've got everything, like that's what you need to do.

2056
01:13:21.88 --> 01:13:22.72
Right?

2057
01:13:22.72 --> 01:13:26.96
So that's, this is as thorough as you could hope for.

2058
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:28.96
They forgot the spinning, jumping,

2059
01:13:28.96 --> 01:13:31.68
double reverse, inverted, upside down.

2060
01:13:33.04 --> 01:13:34.88
We'll plot that, but other than that.

2061
01:13:34.88 --> 01:13:36.36
And you know, we had Tim Kennedy on

2062
01:13:36.36 --> 01:13:39.04
and he was talking about, he's the three-time,

2063
01:13:39.04 --> 01:13:43.76
the three-time army combatives champion.

2064
01:13:43.76 --> 01:13:44.92
And when he won, he won it twice

2065
01:13:44.92 --> 01:13:46.24
and he was the only person that had won it twice

2066
01:13:46.24 --> 01:13:47.56
and then he won it three times.

2067
01:13:47.56 --> 01:13:49.64
But that's just an awesome competition.

2068
01:13:49.64 --> 01:13:51.72
And it's grueling what they do.

2069
01:13:51.72 --> 01:13:53.20
It's like multiple fights.

2070
01:13:53.20 --> 01:13:56.08
And the rules kind of escalate as you go through.

2071
01:13:56.08 --> 01:13:57.44
I think like the first day,

2072
01:13:57.44 --> 01:13:58.76
when they're just trying to weed people out,

2073
01:13:58.76 --> 01:14:00.08
it's just like grappling only.

2074
01:14:00.08 --> 01:14:00.92
Yeah.

2075
01:14:00.92 --> 01:14:03.44
And then the next day is like grappling with

2076
01:14:03.44 --> 01:14:05.52
strikes on the ground or something like this.

2077
01:14:05.52 --> 01:14:08.80
And then like the finals is just basically MMA

2078
01:14:08.80 --> 01:14:11.36
and the freaking fatigue's on, right?

2079
01:14:11.36 --> 01:14:13.56
That's freaking legit, man.

2080
01:14:13.56 --> 01:14:16.28
And there's, everybody shows up to that thing.

2081
01:14:16.28 --> 01:14:18.92
It's the army, right?

2082
01:14:18.92 --> 01:14:20.56
Freaking legit.

2083
01:14:20.56 --> 01:14:23.72
Outstanding way to figure out where people are at.

2084
01:14:23.72 --> 01:14:27.44
And then it gets into like unit training.

2085
01:14:28.48 --> 01:14:30.40
And a successful unit combatist program

2086
01:14:30.40 --> 01:14:31.88
continued to focus on the core techniques

2087
01:14:31.88 --> 01:14:33.92
taught to soldiers during the international military training.

2088
01:14:33.92 --> 01:14:35.88
Mastery of these moves, not exposure to a large number

2089
01:14:35.88 --> 01:14:38.36
of techniques will result in more proficient fighters.

2090
01:14:38.36 --> 01:14:40.28
For unit combat is training to be successful.

2091
01:14:40.28 --> 01:14:43.04
It must become an integral part of the unit's culture.

2092
01:14:43.04 --> 01:14:44.64
Successful unit combat is programs

2093
01:14:44.64 --> 01:14:45.96
have four characteristics.

2094
01:14:45.96 --> 01:14:47.88
Training for every soldier,

2095
01:14:47.88 --> 01:14:50.08
set standards and hold people accountable for them,

2096
01:14:50.08 --> 01:14:52.84
motivate soldiers and leaders to achieve excellence,

2097
01:14:52.84 --> 01:14:54.88
integrate combatives into mission training.

2098
01:14:54.88 --> 01:14:58.000
So I think like that's the kind of thing

2099
01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.92
that statement right there.

2100
01:14:59.92 --> 01:15:02.56
This is what law enforcement needs to look at.

2101
01:15:02.56 --> 01:15:03.40
Yeah.

2102
01:15:03.40 --> 01:15:04.96
Combatives training for everyone.

2103
01:15:04.96 --> 01:15:06.24
They need to do it all the time.

2104
01:15:06.24 --> 01:15:07.96
It needs to be part of mission training.

2105
01:15:07.96 --> 01:15:10.44
And I've been going around saying for the last couple of years

2106
01:15:10.44 --> 01:15:12.56
that I think law enforcement should be training

2107
01:15:12.56 --> 01:15:17.40
20% of their time, 20% of the time that you're at work

2108
01:15:17.40 --> 01:15:20.08
as law enforcement, you should be getting trained.

2109
01:15:20.08 --> 01:15:20.92
But I think it was interesting

2110
01:15:20.92 --> 01:15:23.60
because Jocko, we talked about this personally

2111
01:15:23.60 --> 01:15:24.56
about law enforcement.

2112
01:15:24.56 --> 01:15:26.52
You're like, you've done vehicle interdiction.

2113
01:15:26.52 --> 01:15:29.40
You've actually done it in wartime scenarios at night.

2114
01:15:29.40 --> 01:15:33.52
And the thing is, I'd rather get arrested by Jocko than,

2115
01:15:33.52 --> 01:15:34.36
actually no.

2116
01:15:34.36 --> 01:15:38.40
Other people would prefer to get arrested by Jocko

2117
01:15:38.40 --> 01:15:40.44
than someone else who doesn't know Jiu Jitsu.

2118
01:15:40.44 --> 01:15:44.04
So the thing is, yeah, it's not always nice of me.

2119
01:15:44.04 --> 01:15:47.76
I'm also not that nice back, by the way, to be fair.

2120
01:15:47.76 --> 01:15:50.08
But I think it's going to be, is that extreme?

2121
01:15:50.08 --> 01:15:55.08
I think the idea of human confrontation,

2122
01:15:55.76 --> 01:15:57.32
just being used that more and more.

2123
01:15:57.32 --> 01:15:59.28
I mean, how do you get debate skills

2124
01:15:59.28 --> 01:16:01.000
without getting into, you're not getting argument,

2125
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:01.84
not falling argument,

2126
01:16:01.84 --> 01:16:03.52
but you actually have to get into the debate itself.

2127
01:16:03.52 --> 01:16:05.32
You can just talk by yourself or get in the debate

2128
01:16:05.32 --> 01:16:07.48
with someone else to get skills like that.

2129
01:16:07.48 --> 01:16:10.80
So I think it's a good point, plus you get in shape.

2130
01:16:10.80 --> 01:16:13.28
Yeah, so let me ask you this question.

2131
01:16:13.28 --> 01:16:17.04
Picture you have 10 police officers.

2132
01:16:17.04 --> 01:16:17.88
Yeah.

2133
01:16:17.88 --> 01:16:21.74
And there's a scenario that's unfolding.

2134
01:16:22.84 --> 01:16:26.04
And one of the groups of 10 is like normal police officers

2135
01:16:26.04 --> 01:16:30.12
today and they have the normal four hours per year

2136
01:16:30.12 --> 01:16:33.96
of defensive tactics and combatives.

2137
01:16:33.96 --> 01:16:38.04
But you have all 10 of them versus another department

2138
01:16:38.04 --> 01:16:41.04
that is training 20% of their time has spent training.

2139
01:16:41.04 --> 01:16:43.52
So, and they've been for a year,

2140
01:16:43.52 --> 01:16:45.94
have been spent 20% of their time training.

2141
01:16:45.94 --> 01:16:49.72
And there's a call, some emergency situation.

2142
01:16:49.72 --> 01:16:53.000
There's somebody going crazy with a knife.

2143
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.32
There's a domestic violence scenario

2144
01:16:57.32 --> 01:17:00.30
where a guy's on PCP and he's freaking out.

2145
01:17:01.64 --> 01:17:03.72
And, or you come home to your house

2146
01:17:03.72 --> 01:17:06.72
and there's like something bad is happening at your house.

2147
01:17:06.72 --> 01:17:08.32
Who do you want to show up?

2148
01:17:09.24 --> 01:17:12.04
That is it, do you want the 10 people,

2149
01:17:12.04 --> 01:17:14.64
the 10 police officers that have had four hours of training

2150
01:17:14.64 --> 01:17:16.44
each, so 40 hours of training,

2151
01:17:16.44 --> 01:17:18.80
or do you want only eight?

2152
01:17:18.80 --> 01:17:20.68
Because two of these guys are actually

2153
01:17:20.68 --> 01:17:22.44
on their training right now, they're not working.

2154
01:17:22.44 --> 01:17:25.28
So you only get eight, but that eight

2155
01:17:25.28 --> 01:17:27.44
has trained hundreds of hours over the last year

2156
01:17:27.44 --> 01:17:29.12
to prepare for all these different scenarios.

2157
01:17:29.12 --> 01:17:32.16
There's no doubt who, anyone would pick.

2158
01:17:32.16 --> 01:17:33.52
Anyone would pick.

2159
01:17:33.52 --> 01:17:35.72
Well, that time could be a lot of better study of law.

2160
01:17:35.72 --> 01:17:37.88
It could be a lot more for, I don't know,

2161
01:17:37.88 --> 01:17:38.72
marksmanship, could be a lot more.

2162
01:17:38.72 --> 01:17:39.88
They're stupid if they say that.

2163
01:17:39.88 --> 01:17:43.12
It could be a lot more for counseling sessions.

2164
01:17:43.12 --> 01:17:45.32
I mean, the thing is we're talking about human confrontation

2165
01:17:45.32 --> 01:17:48.36
and I think how to deescalate because in Jitsu,

2166
01:17:48.36 --> 01:17:49.76
it's not always about me being stronger than you,

2167
01:17:49.76 --> 01:17:51.48
it's about me finding a way around.

2168
01:17:51.48 --> 01:17:52.32
Yeah, and it's also,

2169
01:17:52.32 --> 01:17:55.36
and also that training is not necessarily,

2170
01:17:55.36 --> 01:17:58.36
it's not all combat, it's not all shooting.

2171
01:17:58.36 --> 01:18:00.52
You will be taking deescalation.

2172
01:18:00.52 --> 01:18:01.76
Hey, how do you deal with someone that's,

2173
01:18:01.76 --> 01:18:03.000
oh, you can tell they're clearly angry,

2174
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.56
it's a domestic violence situation,

2175
01:18:04.56 --> 01:18:06.80
the guy's freaking out, what are you gonna do?

2176
01:18:06.80 --> 01:18:07.92
Hey, you need to settle down.

2177
01:18:07.92 --> 01:18:10.48
And that's like, no, that's not gonna work out well.

2178
01:18:10.48 --> 01:18:11.32
Yeah.

2179
01:18:11.32 --> 01:18:13.80
You need to, hey, keep some distance, talk to them.

2180
01:18:13.80 --> 01:18:15.04
You can, so you're gonna get trained

2181
01:18:15.04 --> 01:18:16.32
in all these different aspects,

2182
01:18:16.32 --> 01:18:18.16
it's not just training on shooting and fighting,

2183
01:18:18.16 --> 01:18:19.64
it's training on how to deescalate,

2184
01:18:19.64 --> 01:18:22.52
how to get control, how to set things up,

2185
01:18:22.52 --> 01:18:24.80
what psychological maneuvers can you make

2186
01:18:24.80 --> 01:18:25.72
to get someone to calm down?

2187
01:18:25.72 --> 01:18:28.72
Like all those things are what you need to get trained in.

2188
01:18:28.72 --> 01:18:32.28
So the fact that I hear the excuse of like,

2189
01:18:32.28 --> 01:18:33.64
well, you need the police out,

2190
01:18:33.64 --> 01:18:37.000
no, untrained police have less value,

2191
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.30
way less value than trained police, not even close.

2192
01:18:41.80 --> 01:18:42.72
And you know, that was another thing

2193
01:18:42.72 --> 01:18:44.44
where I was having some of those discussions

2194
01:18:44.44 --> 01:18:47.84
and arguments while I was in the SEAL teams about,

2195
01:18:47.84 --> 01:18:49.52
hey, this system that we're using right now,

2196
01:18:49.52 --> 01:18:51.40
the guys are trained up in five days.

2197
01:18:51.40 --> 01:18:53.52
The system that you're talking about would take years,

2198
01:18:53.52 --> 01:18:55.96
you know, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

2199
01:18:55.96 --> 01:18:59.32
10 years to get proficient at.

2200
01:18:59.32 --> 01:19:00.84
And I remember, I think it was like,

2201
01:19:00.84 --> 01:19:03.04
occasionally you get a good comeback or whatever.

2202
01:19:03.04 --> 01:19:05.68
I was like, well, you're in the teams for 20.

2203
01:19:05.68 --> 01:19:07.04
So why not get good at it?

2204
01:19:07.04 --> 01:19:09.24
You know, why would you expect someone to get good

2205
01:19:09.24 --> 01:19:11.04
in five days at something that takes a lifetime

2206
01:19:11.04 --> 01:19:11.88
to get good at?

2207
01:19:11.88 --> 01:19:13.60
And by the way, you're in the SEAL teams for 20 years,

2208
01:19:13.60 --> 01:19:15.68
at least, well, I guess you could be for less.

2209
01:19:15.68 --> 01:19:16.52
No, I'm just kidding.

2210
01:19:16.52 --> 01:19:17.84
But most guys, most guys are in it

2211
01:19:17.84 --> 01:19:21.60
for four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 20, 25 years.

2212
01:19:21.60 --> 01:19:22.92
Let's get good at this thing.

2213
01:19:25.64 --> 01:19:28.64
So that's the unit training and they talk about standards

2214
01:19:28.64 --> 01:19:31.64
and they talk about making it part of your physical training.

2215
01:19:31.64 --> 01:19:32.48
Yeah.

2216
01:19:32.48 --> 01:19:33.32
Right?

2217
01:19:33.32 --> 01:19:34.76
If you're gonna train, that's another thing.

2218
01:19:34.76 --> 01:19:38.92
Like police officers, that 20% of time

2219
01:19:38.92 --> 01:19:40.84
that should be spent training, that includes,

2220
01:19:40.84 --> 01:19:42.28
like, how are you getting in shape?

2221
01:19:42.28 --> 01:19:43.12
Are you in shape?

2222
01:19:43.12 --> 01:19:44.32
I want to be in shape if you're caught.

2223
01:19:44.32 --> 01:19:46.04
Oh my God.

2224
01:19:46.04 --> 01:19:48.04
You know, you see these, you see these,

2225
01:19:48.04 --> 01:19:51.40
some of these videos of police officers

2226
01:19:52.84 --> 01:19:54.08
and you're thinking, wait a second,

2227
01:19:54.08 --> 01:19:56.60
how is this person gonna stop anybody

2228
01:19:56.60 --> 01:19:59.36
that's remotely athletic, even if I just run away?

2229
01:19:59.36 --> 01:20:00.96
How are you gonna catch anybody?

2230
01:20:02.16 --> 01:20:03.000
Yeah.

2231
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.20
And you know, this whole thing, you know,

2232
01:20:04.20 --> 01:20:07.20
that we did a podcast on the Uvaldi situation

2233
01:20:07.20 --> 01:20:11.000
and it's just, what else needs to happen in America

2234
01:20:12.48 --> 01:20:14.64
to realize that we need more training?

2235
01:20:14.64 --> 01:20:18.20
And by the way, that Uvaldi situation,

2236
01:20:19.48 --> 01:20:22.48
the fact that people didn't respond

2237
01:20:22.48 --> 01:20:27.48
and acted in a cowardly manner is also part of training.

2238
01:20:28.84 --> 01:20:30.12
It's also part of training,

2239
01:20:30.12 --> 01:20:33.56
because you learn like, oh, if I don't do something aggressive,

2240
01:20:33.56 --> 01:20:35.40
then I'm gonna get caught.

2241
01:20:35.40 --> 01:20:37.56
I'm gonna look bad, I'm gonna be bad,

2242
01:20:37.56 --> 01:20:40.04
I'm gonna, the culture changes.

2243
01:20:40.04 --> 01:20:41.48
If you have a culture, and I used to see this

2244
01:20:41.48 --> 01:20:43.52
with seal platoons, if you had a culture that like,

2245
01:20:43.52 --> 01:20:45.32
you had some of these seal platoons coming through

2246
01:20:45.32 --> 01:20:47.36
and they were like ready to take on the world.

2247
01:20:47.36 --> 01:20:48.76
And you throw some scenario at them,

2248
01:20:48.76 --> 01:20:51.08
they were going on the attack.

2249
01:20:51.08 --> 01:20:53.76
And that's a culture that happens.

2250
01:20:53.76 --> 01:20:55.16
You have another seal platoon where it's like,

2251
01:20:55.16 --> 01:20:58.84
well, we're cautious, we have a zero defect policy,

2252
01:20:58.84 --> 01:20:59.88
we don't wanna get in trouble,

2253
01:20:59.88 --> 01:21:00.84
we don't wanna do anything wrong,

2254
01:21:00.84 --> 01:21:02.96
we don't wanna look bad, and that's what happens.

2255
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:04.08
You see them stack up on a building,

2256
01:21:04.08 --> 01:21:06.08
I don't wanna go, do you wanna go, I don't wanna go.

2257
01:21:06.08 --> 01:21:10.36
So you have to inculcate them with the right culture

2258
01:21:10.36 --> 01:21:12.12
where they know, hey, if you make a mistake,

2259
01:21:12.12 --> 01:21:14.32
it's okay, because you're getting after it.

2260
01:21:14.32 --> 01:21:15.88
I mean, we just did a freaking podcast

2261
01:21:15.88 --> 01:21:18.12
about the damn Nazis.

2262
01:21:18.12 --> 01:21:21.04
And part of the Nazis culture that they tried to instill

2263
01:21:21.04 --> 01:21:23.64
was we'd rather have you make a bad decision

2264
01:21:23.64 --> 01:21:26.12
and do something than not make a decision at all.

2265
01:21:26.12 --> 01:21:29.80
Yeah, the worst decision is no decision sometimes.

2266
01:21:29.80 --> 01:21:31.96
So the training that I'm talking about,

2267
01:21:31.96 --> 01:21:35.000
it involves everything and it corrects all these problems.

2268
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.64
It's getting in shape, getting more,

2269
01:21:36.64 --> 01:21:40.12
you're attuned to stress, human confrontation,

2270
01:21:40.12 --> 01:21:43.04
de-escalation, how to defend yourself,

2271
01:21:43.04 --> 01:21:47.64
how to not damage or how to lessen damage to a suspect.

2272
01:21:47.64 --> 01:21:49.88
I think it's awesome, overall.

2273
01:21:49.88 --> 01:21:51.36
You had that department that,

2274
01:21:51.36 --> 01:21:53.36
I'm not saying this should be the policy,

2275
01:21:53.36 --> 01:21:56.16
but one was at Michigan, some county, the sheriff,

2276
01:21:56.16 --> 01:21:58.76
everyone had to be a blue belt in his department.

2277
01:21:58.76 --> 01:22:00.92
Now I'm not saying that should be, then again,

2278
01:22:00.92 --> 01:22:04.24
but it sounds like we're on the right track there.

2279
01:22:04.24 --> 01:22:06.60
I'm just saying, I think it's, but then again,

2280
01:22:06.60 --> 01:22:09.84
we're partial because we have this great reality college,

2281
01:22:09.84 --> 01:22:11.76
where we're exposed to the other person.

2282
01:22:11.76 --> 01:22:16.32
But also, we're seeing the news and we're seeing cops

2283
01:22:16.32 --> 01:22:19.28
have to do things and get beat up by one guy

2284
01:22:19.28 --> 01:22:20.80
and taking two or three people to take somebody

2285
01:22:20.80 --> 01:22:23.28
and getting weapons taken away and it's like awful to see.

2286
01:22:23.28 --> 01:22:24.64
How does this even happening?

2287
01:22:24.64 --> 01:22:27.48
So it's not, look, we might be biased towards Jiu-Jitsu,

2288
01:22:27.48 --> 01:22:30.28
fine, take my bias out of it, I'll still tell you

2289
01:22:30.28 --> 01:22:33.20
that you better learn how to fight and you better train

2290
01:22:33.20 --> 01:22:35.60
and you better spend time training.

2291
01:22:35.60 --> 01:22:37.60
Jaco, you've seen at least 10 different videos,

2292
01:22:37.60 --> 01:22:40.84
10 different, I'm talking Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt

2293
01:22:40.84 --> 01:22:42.96
versus random Jiu-Jitsu.

2294
01:22:42.96 --> 01:22:44.52
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like for instance,

2295
01:22:44.52 --> 01:22:46.40
he's mounted on the I-Com, Matt Serra,

2296
01:22:46.40 --> 01:22:49.76
in Vegas this drunk guy was harassing him and haul.

2297
01:22:50.96 --> 01:22:52.64
Rhyan haul, also in some restaurant.

2298
01:22:52.64 --> 01:22:53.48
Rhyan haul?

2299
01:22:53.48 --> 01:22:54.32
No, Rhyan haul.

2300
01:22:54.32 --> 01:22:55.16
Rhyan haul, yeah, yeah.

2301
01:22:55.16 --> 01:22:56.28
I'm full of drunk people and they're just mounted like,

2302
01:22:56.28 --> 01:22:58.76
hey man, calm down, I'll sue you and this whole guy,

2303
01:22:58.76 --> 01:23:00.20
you know, hey, call with the cop, you know,

2304
01:23:00.20 --> 01:23:02.08
and the security comes and nobody gets punched.

2305
01:23:02.08 --> 01:23:04.44
And I know this is the cops and the guy doesn't have a gun,

2306
01:23:04.44 --> 01:23:06.36
I understand, but I'm saying these are black belts,

2307
01:23:06.36 --> 01:23:07.68
which is of course different level,

2308
01:23:07.68 --> 01:23:09.40
but they're holding it out and not hurting them.

2309
01:23:09.40 --> 01:23:12.44
And they don't have three homies with batons.

2310
01:23:12.44 --> 01:23:13.88
So by the way, you wanna have groups,

2311
01:23:13.88 --> 01:23:17.08
you wanna have team tactics with law enforcement,

2312
01:23:17.08 --> 01:23:18.40
of course, I'm not saying,

2313
01:23:18.40 --> 01:23:20.96
but it is cool if you have the ability

2314
01:23:20.96 --> 01:23:23.12
and the opportunity to, well, look at that.

2315
01:23:23.12 --> 01:23:25.48
And it's also one from Brazil, this guy tried to,

2316
01:23:25.48 --> 01:23:27.56
I'm not saying, I think she's just left,

2317
01:23:27.56 --> 01:23:31.28
but this guy tried to, I don't know,

2318
01:23:31.28 --> 01:23:32.68
take her purse or something and she's like,

2319
01:23:32.68 --> 01:23:33.92
mounted on the guy, just beat him up.

2320
01:23:33.92 --> 01:23:35.72
This is in Brazil, legit black belt,

2321
01:23:35.72 --> 01:23:37.56
just female, just, the guy screaming,

2322
01:23:37.56 --> 01:23:39.68
he's going soco, soco, which means help in Portuguese.

2323
01:23:39.68 --> 01:23:42.48
Soco, soco, it means help in Portuguese

2324
01:23:42.48 --> 01:23:44.72
and no one's helping him, it's just a film.

2325
01:23:44.72 --> 01:23:46.68
It's like, just mounted, just beat the guy,

2326
01:23:46.68 --> 01:23:49.88
like it's kinda brutal, but that is just,

2327
01:23:49.88 --> 01:23:51.60
let's say it's a grandiose comparison,

2328
01:23:51.60 --> 01:23:55.68
but if you have that opportunity and that ability,

2329
01:23:55.68 --> 01:23:57.48
it's pretty cool, there we go.

2330
01:23:57.48 --> 01:24:02.48
And it's heinous to watch this stuff

2331
01:24:02.48 --> 01:24:06.92
on an almost daily basis, or, I mean, at least once a week,

2332
01:24:06.92 --> 01:24:10.88
you're seeing a video of a cop that's not trained

2333
01:24:10.88 --> 01:24:12.48
and at a bad outcome.

2334
01:24:13.32 --> 01:24:15.44
And look, there's all kinds of cops

2335
01:24:15.44 --> 01:24:16.56
that are doing the right thing all the time,

2336
01:24:16.56 --> 01:24:17.52
there's cops that train Jiu Jitsu,

2337
01:24:17.52 --> 01:24:19.60
there's cops that are doing things right

2338
01:24:19.60 --> 01:24:20.52
to the best of their ability.

2339
01:24:20.52 --> 01:24:22.84
By the way, they're investing their own money

2340
01:24:22.84 --> 01:24:27.28
and their own time so that they can be better police officers.

2341
01:24:27.28 --> 01:24:29.48
Good on them, but should you have to make that sacrifice?

2342
01:24:29.48 --> 01:24:30.32
And by the way, what if you know,

2343
01:24:30.32 --> 01:24:32.92
a guy's got a wife and kids and he's got a mortgage to pay

2344
01:24:32.92 --> 01:24:36.96
and all of a sudden, it's $148 a month to train Jiu Jitsu

2345
01:24:36.96 --> 01:24:39.80
or it's $165 a month to train Jiu Jitsu,

2346
01:24:39.80 --> 01:24:41.68
all of a sudden it's like,

2347
01:24:41.68 --> 01:24:45.56
I gotta make a choice between getting my kid a new bicycle

2348
01:24:45.56 --> 01:24:47.64
and training Jiu Jitsu, you know what,

2349
01:24:47.64 --> 01:24:49.72
I'm gonna sacrifice this month and the next thing,

2350
01:24:49.72 --> 01:24:52.48
they look up in three years and they're not trained anymore.

2351
01:24:52.48 --> 01:24:57.48
So why not help the police so that they can help the community?

2352
01:24:57.48 --> 01:25:00.88
You know, they're doing a good job is our bro Ryan with BP.

2353
01:25:00.88 --> 01:25:01.72
Yeah.

2354
01:25:01.72 --> 01:25:04.60
Yes, that was React now, it's called the Bortak.

2355
01:25:04.60 --> 01:25:06.36
They're like the federal SWAT team with the border.

2356
01:25:06.36 --> 01:25:08.28
They actually had the guys who killed the Uvaldi shooter.

2357
01:25:08.28 --> 01:25:09.60
Yeah, 100%.

2358
01:25:09.60 --> 01:25:11.40
But these guys actually, Ryan has these guys,

2359
01:25:11.40 --> 01:25:12.96
I mean, they do medical training, I don't know,

2360
01:25:12.96 --> 01:25:16.84
but every day, but they have the Umbaricades training,

2361
01:25:16.84 --> 01:25:18.20
you know, or they're doing ground,

2362
01:25:18.20 --> 01:25:20.40
I even did a few similar classes out there

2363
01:25:20.40 --> 01:25:22.56
and they don't wanna learn like the new knee lock, you know,

2364
01:25:22.56 --> 01:25:23.96
and they're doing like the combattas,

2365
01:25:23.96 --> 01:25:26.72
but for the Bortak, it's pretty cool

2366
01:25:26.72 --> 01:25:28.56
because they're not just sitting around

2367
01:25:28.56 --> 01:25:29.48
while they're going on duty,

2368
01:25:29.48 --> 01:25:30.68
but they actually training every day.

2369
01:25:30.68 --> 01:25:31.52
That's pretty cool.

2370
01:25:31.52 --> 01:25:35.68
And that's the way law enforcement should be.

2371
01:25:35.68 --> 01:25:38.32
You should train 20% of your time.

2372
01:25:38.32 --> 01:25:40.84
If that means you train, you know, an hour a day

2373
01:25:40.84 --> 01:25:42.20
or an hour and a half or two hours every day,

2374
01:25:42.20 --> 01:25:43.60
or that means you take one day a week

2375
01:25:43.60 --> 01:25:47.08
where you train all day, I don't know, but figure it out,

2376
01:25:47.08 --> 01:25:47.92
because if you're not training,

2377
01:25:47.92 --> 01:25:49.000
you're not gonna be prepared.

2378
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.68
And when you're not prepared, then you overreact.

2379
01:25:50.68 --> 01:25:53.20
When you overreact, that causes problems.

2380
01:25:53.20 --> 01:25:57.48
And then you get, you know, innocent people getting killed,

2381
01:25:57.48 --> 01:25:59.56
or people that don't deserve to get killed, get killed.

2382
01:25:59.56 --> 01:26:00.40
Why?

2383
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:01.64
Because there's a panic happening.

2384
01:26:01.64 --> 01:26:04.60
It's extreme jockel, but I had a acquaintance

2385
01:26:04.60 --> 01:26:05.76
that we're talking, he was talking about,

2386
01:26:05.76 --> 01:26:08.44
he was an Afghanistan, he was in the Marines,

2387
01:26:08.44 --> 01:26:10.80
and he was like, no, an army, my bad, it was army.

2388
01:26:10.80 --> 01:26:12.64
Both sides will kill me for saying that.

2389
01:26:12.64 --> 01:26:14.72
And he was talking about how they would practice

2390
01:26:14.72 --> 01:26:16.52
putting IVs in with night vision on.

2391
01:26:16.52 --> 01:26:17.36
Yeah.

2392
01:26:17.36 --> 01:26:19.24
And like, you know, well, why?

2393
01:26:19.24 --> 01:26:21.88
Well, in case we have night vision on, we can't see, you know?

2394
01:26:21.88 --> 01:26:23.44
And, you know, cause it's different,

2395
01:26:23.44 --> 01:26:24.96
that perception or whatever, but he's like, yeah,

2396
01:26:24.96 --> 01:26:27.20
you know, that's just something like, okay, that makes sense.

2397
01:26:27.20 --> 01:26:28.92
But that sounds kind of extreme.

2398
01:26:28.92 --> 01:26:30.60
Well, why is it extreme?

2399
01:26:30.60 --> 01:26:31.76
One day you might have to do that.

2400
01:26:31.76 --> 01:26:33.92
Yeah, and how much better are you prepared for

2401
01:26:33.92 --> 01:26:35.60
if you don't have to have night vision on?

2402
01:26:35.60 --> 01:26:36.44
Well, cool.

2403
01:26:36.44 --> 01:26:37.28
Yeah, it's easier.

2404
01:26:37.28 --> 01:26:39.20
If you happen to roll up on a suspect

2405
01:26:39.20 --> 01:26:42.44
and they attack you and they weigh 110 pounds,

2406
01:26:42.44 --> 01:26:44.64
and they don't know anything, cool, you can handle them.

2407
01:26:44.64 --> 01:26:45.48
Great.

2408
01:26:45.48 --> 01:26:46.80
But what happens when they're 220 pounds

2409
01:26:46.80 --> 01:26:48.12
and they're a purple belt?

2410
01:26:48.12 --> 01:26:48.96
Yeah.

2411
01:26:48.96 --> 01:26:50.40
Or they wrestled in high school.

2412
01:26:50.40 --> 01:26:52.48
Is it most training for in case something goes wrong?

2413
01:26:52.48 --> 01:26:53.32
Should be.

2414
01:26:53.32 --> 01:26:54.24
So you have a jam in your pistol.

2415
01:26:54.24 --> 01:26:56.32
Oh, well, I mean, you didn't clean your pistol correctly.

2416
01:26:56.32 --> 01:26:57.28
Well, it's still gonna happen.

2417
01:26:57.28 --> 01:26:58.20
It's still gonna have jams.

2418
01:26:58.20 --> 01:27:00.28
There's level one, two, I don't know, three, what level?

2419
01:27:00.28 --> 01:27:01.64
That's what Sarge taught me.

2420
01:27:01.64 --> 01:27:02.84
Different ways to clear a jam.

2421
01:27:02.84 --> 01:27:04.76
But in case something goes wrong,

2422
01:27:04.76 --> 01:27:06.36
if nothing goes wrong, you actually don't need to drill.

2423
01:27:06.36 --> 01:27:08.12
Really think, why do I need to drill

2424
01:27:08.12 --> 01:27:09.24
if nothing ever goes wrong?

2425
01:27:09.24 --> 01:27:10.32
Something's gonna go wrong eventually.

2426
01:27:10.32 --> 01:27:11.36
So that's, I'm just saying,

2427
01:27:11.36 --> 01:27:13.60
you did to martial arts, what they're doing in the army,

2428
01:27:13.60 --> 01:27:16.16
I think is really good because we're getting ready for,

2429
01:27:16.16 --> 01:27:17.52
in case something bad happens.

2430
01:27:17.52 --> 01:27:18.36
Yeah.

2431
01:27:18.36 --> 01:27:22.16
So all of this will straighten out your mindset.

2432
01:27:22.16 --> 01:27:23.08
Yeah.

2433
01:27:23.08 --> 01:27:25.36
It will straighten out your mindset.

2434
01:27:25.36 --> 01:27:29.28
Cause if you're not used to this stuff,

2435
01:27:29.28 --> 01:27:30.88
when somebody grabs you and you're not used to it,

2436
01:27:30.88 --> 01:27:32.76
like somebody grabs me or you or you,

2437
01:27:32.76 --> 01:27:34.96
like somebody grabs one of us,

2438
01:27:34.96 --> 01:27:38.40
there's no mental hurdle of any kind

2439
01:27:38.40 --> 01:27:40.76
to be prepared for combat in that moment.

2440
01:27:40.76 --> 01:27:43.64
Most people, when they get grabbed,

2441
01:27:43.64 --> 01:27:45.36
they haven't ever been grabbed before.

2442
01:27:45.36 --> 01:27:48.24
And they have to, they have a giant mental hurdle clear

2443
01:27:48.24 --> 01:27:51.08
before they can even respond in any way.

2444
01:27:51.08 --> 01:27:52.12
Nevermind appropriately.

2445
01:27:52.12 --> 01:27:53.84
And by the way, they're not gonna respond appropriately.

2446
01:27:53.84 --> 01:27:55.72
They're gonna respond badly.

2447
01:27:55.72 --> 01:27:59.74
So it's like, this has to change.

2448
01:28:01.12 --> 01:28:03.16
And like you said, I mean, I think this,

2449
01:28:03.16 --> 01:28:05.48
a lot of the stuff that's in this army combat is manual

2450
01:28:05.48 --> 01:28:08.96
is suitable for law enforcement.

2451
01:28:09.96 --> 01:28:11.56
And there's some people that freak out, by the way,

2452
01:28:11.56 --> 01:28:12.40
when you say that,

2453
01:28:12.40 --> 01:28:17.04
oh, you want the cops to be military, paramilitary?

2454
01:28:17.04 --> 01:28:18.76
Yes, actually.

2455
01:28:18.76 --> 01:28:19.76
I want them to be well trained.

2456
01:28:19.76 --> 01:28:22.60
I want them to be ready for whatever's going to happen.

2457
01:28:23.56 --> 01:28:24.40
Yeah.

2458
01:28:24.40 --> 01:28:26.32
So there you go.

2459
01:28:29.16 --> 01:28:31.92
Then they go through like how to sustain,

2460
01:28:31.92 --> 01:28:33.72
how to get people sustained,

2461
01:28:33.72 --> 01:28:38.72
where they can then keep up their training and stay good.

2462
01:28:38.72 --> 01:28:41.04
Here's an everyday mission essential task list

2463
01:28:41.04 --> 01:28:43.32
requiring use of combative skills.

2464
01:28:43.32 --> 01:28:46.08
A compliant subject at a traffic control point

2465
01:28:46.08 --> 01:28:48.12
suddenly becomes non-compliant.

2466
01:28:48.12 --> 01:28:51.28
These are just like things to run, just scenarios to run.

2467
01:28:51.28 --> 01:28:53.56
The battalion indicates that an intelligent subject

2468
01:28:53.56 --> 01:28:56.16
must be captured during the search and seizure mission.

2469
01:28:56.16 --> 01:28:58.000
The lead man in the search team encounters

2470
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.12
hostile opposition and has a weapons malfunction.

2471
01:29:01.12 --> 01:29:02.16
Okay.

2472
01:29:02.16 --> 01:29:03.000
Could that happen?

2473
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.36
Yes, absolutely.

2474
01:29:04.36 --> 01:29:06.40
Three, when turning on the enemy,

2475
01:29:06.40 --> 01:29:09.48
grab the soldier's weapon and pins him against the wall.

2476
01:29:09.48 --> 01:29:10.32
Okay, could that happen?

2477
01:29:10.32 --> 01:29:11.64
Yes, it could.

2478
01:29:11.64 --> 01:29:14.000
In close quarters, an enemy attacks a soldier

2479
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.44
under zero illumination.

2480
01:29:15.44 --> 01:29:16.28
Could that happen?

2481
01:29:16.28 --> 01:29:17.12
Yes, it could.

2482
01:29:18.44 --> 01:29:21.56
These are everyday situations that could happen.

2483
01:29:21.56 --> 01:29:22.68
Well, yeah, they could happen in combat,

2484
01:29:22.68 --> 01:29:25.04
but they could happen in law enforcement as well.

2485
01:29:25.04 --> 01:29:27.72
And if you're not ready for them in any way,

2486
01:29:27.72 --> 01:29:29.76
you're not going to know what to do

2487
01:29:29.76 --> 01:29:31.60
and you're going to fall apart.

2488
01:29:31.60 --> 01:29:33.32
And then you're going to have to go through

2489
01:29:33.32 --> 01:29:36.60
what you're about to do and you're going to fall apart.

2490
01:29:36.60 --> 01:29:38.48
And then you're going to end up doing something stupid.

2491
01:29:38.48 --> 01:29:42.60
You know, I've heard, actually,

2492
01:29:42.60 --> 01:29:43.80
we talked about this when I was in Puerto Rico

2493
01:29:43.80 --> 01:29:45.60
working with a couple of military guys,

2494
01:29:45.60 --> 01:29:48.32
that a lot of guys are used to these optics,

2495
01:29:48.32 --> 01:29:50.60
like these, you know, BealTech,

2496
01:29:50.60 --> 01:29:53.08
whatever these things on their carbines or their pistols.

2497
01:29:53.08 --> 01:29:55.20
If that doesn't work one day or it goes out,

2498
01:29:55.20 --> 01:29:57.000
they're not practiced with open sights.

2499
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.04
So the thing is like, I mean, if you rely upon

2500
01:30:00.04 --> 01:30:01.80
that right there, specifically that,

2501
01:30:01.80 --> 01:30:03.68
you don't have that available to you, like, you know,

2502
01:30:03.68 --> 01:30:07.56
you're not keeping yourself up to date

2503
01:30:07.56 --> 01:30:09.04
upon if something goes wrong, the drilling,

2504
01:30:09.04 --> 01:30:09.96
I think it's really good.

2505
01:30:09.96 --> 01:30:13.12
So if you're exactly caught and you can't see,

2506
01:30:13.12 --> 01:30:15.32
if I can have someone, if I have a hold of someone,

2507
01:30:15.32 --> 01:30:17.24
I don't need my eyes that much, to be honest.

2508
01:30:17.24 --> 01:30:18.08
You don't really need your eyes.

2509
01:30:18.08 --> 01:30:18.92
You can't even tell me.

2510
01:30:18.92 --> 01:30:20.24
Five-year leg, I know what that is.

2511
01:30:20.24 --> 01:30:21.56
Yeah, people compete when they're blind.

2512
01:30:21.56 --> 01:30:22.40
Yeah, absolutely.

2513
01:30:22.40 --> 01:30:23.24
There's some strong guys.

2514
01:30:23.24 --> 01:30:24.56
Strong, blind guys.

2515
01:30:24.56 --> 01:30:27.20
Ryan Job, I was trained with Ryan Job after he was blind.

2516
01:30:27.20 --> 01:30:28.08
And it was like, you know,

2517
01:30:28.08 --> 01:30:31.40
once you make contact with him, it's like, it's on.

2518
01:30:31.40 --> 01:30:32.24
Yeah.

2519
01:30:34.76 --> 01:30:36.68
Talks about, you know, a bunch of stuff

2520
01:30:36.68 --> 01:30:40.60
with live training, ground sparring, situational sparring.

2521
01:30:40.60 --> 01:30:41.76
Right, that's something that we've been doing

2522
01:30:41.76 --> 01:30:43.28
for a long time.

2523
01:30:43.28 --> 01:30:46.04
Soldier A begins in Soldier B's guard.

2524
01:30:46.04 --> 01:30:47.92
They spar until Soldier A passes the guard,

2525
01:30:47.92 --> 01:30:49.04
his swept or submitted.

2526
01:30:49.96 --> 01:30:51.64
Reset, reset points, yeah.

2527
01:30:51.64 --> 01:30:53.000
That's it.

2528
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.80
It's very straightforward things,

2529
01:30:54.80 --> 01:30:58.84
but you could do that with every aspect,

2530
01:30:58.84 --> 01:31:00.08
like any of these scenarios.

2531
01:31:00.08 --> 01:31:02.36
You can run these scenarios, okay, it's dark,

2532
01:31:02.36 --> 01:31:03.64
you grab my weapon, let's do it once,

2533
01:31:03.64 --> 01:31:04.96
let's do it twice, let's do it three times,

2534
01:31:04.96 --> 01:31:08.000
let's do it five times, what works, what doesn't work?

2535
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.92
These are like pieces of the puzzle

2536
01:31:09.92 --> 01:31:12.000
that separate each piece as different,

2537
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.84
but in the end, you put it all together.

2538
01:31:13.84 --> 01:31:15.80
So it's hard to do the puzzle unless you see,

2539
01:31:15.80 --> 01:31:17.60
you know, what the picture is, you know,

2540
01:31:17.60 --> 01:31:18.64
what you're gonna make.

2541
01:31:18.64 --> 01:31:20.12
And if you don't understand the pieces,

2542
01:31:20.12 --> 01:31:21.68
they make the frame with the corners first,

2543
01:31:21.68 --> 01:31:24.16
and of course, and so I think it's a good way

2544
01:31:24.16 --> 01:31:26.80
to have these situational, or I call it reset drills,

2545
01:31:26.80 --> 01:31:28.76
or timing grade drills.

2546
01:31:28.76 --> 01:31:30.56
It's really good to have.

2547
01:31:30.56 --> 01:31:32.96
Yeah, and they go through, you know,

2548
01:31:32.96 --> 01:31:35.80
everything from like, oh, how you spar on the ground,

2549
01:31:35.80 --> 01:31:38.08
how you spar with takedowns, how you do,

2550
01:31:39.36 --> 01:31:40.96
I guess we call it shootboxing,

2551
01:31:40.96 --> 01:31:42.80
where you're like boxing gloves,

2552
01:31:42.80 --> 01:31:44.40
but you're doing takedowns.

2553
01:31:44.40 --> 01:31:45.68
What do they call that?

2554
01:31:45.68 --> 01:31:47.48
They call it kickboxing with takedowns.

2555
01:31:47.48 --> 01:31:48.48
Okay, cool.

2556
01:31:49.68 --> 01:31:51.88
And then you still have to sometimes,

2557
01:31:51.88 --> 01:31:56.56
as you said earlier, if we only do shootboxing,

2558
01:31:56.56 --> 01:31:59.12
and we never do wrestling by itself,

2559
01:31:59.12 --> 01:32:04.12
or we never advance to where we're doing a full sparring,

2560
01:32:06.52 --> 01:32:08.88
then we're gonna miss something.

2561
01:32:08.88 --> 01:32:12.44
So you have to mix it up to some extent,

2562
01:32:12.44 --> 01:32:13.44
or it can be a problem.

2563
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.52
This is where it starts talking about

2564
01:32:21.52 --> 01:32:24.20
basic ground fighting techniques.

2565
01:32:24.20 --> 01:32:27.96
Basic ground fighting techniques build a funda...

2566
01:32:27.96 --> 01:32:30.40
So all that, like we, now we're getting in,

2567
01:32:30.40 --> 01:32:32.20
this is just talking about like how to run a program,

2568
01:32:32.20 --> 01:32:34.52
how to set up a program, what the safety protocols are,

2569
01:32:34.52 --> 01:32:37.12
and then it gets into the like the actual fighting.

2570
01:32:37.12 --> 01:32:38.56
Basic ground fighting techniques

2571
01:32:38.56 --> 01:32:41.48
build a fundamental understanding of dominant body positions,

2572
01:32:41.48 --> 01:32:43.08
and should be one of the primary focuses

2573
01:32:43.08 --> 01:32:45.44
before moving on to more advanced techniques.

2574
01:32:45.44 --> 01:32:46.88
Basic fight strategy.

2575
01:32:46.88 --> 01:32:48.72
When two untrained fighters meet,

2576
01:32:48.72 --> 01:32:51.96
they instinctively fight using the universal fight plan.

2577
01:32:51.96 --> 01:32:53.88
They pummel each other with their fists

2578
01:32:53.88 --> 01:32:55.52
until one of them receives enough damage

2579
01:32:55.52 --> 01:32:57.44
that they cannot fight back effectively.

2580
01:32:57.44 --> 01:32:59.16
Most forms of martial arts training

2581
01:32:59.16 --> 01:33:00.80
are designed to make fighters better

2582
01:33:00.80 --> 01:33:02.80
at executing this strategy.

2583
01:33:02.80 --> 01:33:05.36
However, this approach has two drawbacks.

2584
01:33:06.32 --> 01:33:09.64
One, or both fighters are unarmed.

2585
01:33:09.64 --> 01:33:14.36
Progress is solely dependent on the development of skill.

2586
01:33:14.36 --> 01:33:16.96
Bigger, this is actually three drawbacks,

2587
01:33:16.96 --> 01:33:18.52
bigger, stronger, and faster fighters

2588
01:33:18.52 --> 01:33:20.28
have a natural advantage.

2589
01:33:20.28 --> 01:33:22.04
Developing enough skill to overcome these advantages

2590
01:33:22.04 --> 01:33:24.000
requires more time that can be dedicated

2591
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.64
during institutional training.

2592
01:33:25.64 --> 01:33:27.20
Well, that's a little bit of a weird thing to say

2593
01:33:27.20 --> 01:33:28.20
because we already talked about it,

2594
01:33:28.20 --> 01:33:29.40
and they already talked about the fact

2595
01:33:29.40 --> 01:33:31.36
that it's gonna take time.

2596
01:33:31.36 --> 01:33:33.64
So you can't use that excuse here a little bit.

2597
01:33:35.44 --> 01:33:38.08
The combatives program uses a more efficient approach.

2598
01:33:38.08 --> 01:33:39.68
Fighting is taught in the context of strategy.

2599
01:33:39.68 --> 01:33:44.32
The basic fight, basic techniques serve as an educating

2600
01:33:44.32 --> 01:33:47.76
metaphor to teach the basic fight strategy.

2601
01:33:48.80 --> 01:33:50.32
Fighters learn to defeat an opponent

2602
01:33:50.32 --> 01:33:52.28
by controlling the elements of the fight.

2603
01:33:52.28 --> 01:33:54.40
Range, angle, and level.

2604
01:33:55.24 --> 01:33:58.24
The number one element of a fight is range.

2605
01:33:58.24 --> 01:34:00.80
The combatives program has four phases,

2606
01:34:00.80 --> 01:34:04.08
projectile, striking, clinching, grappling.

2607
01:34:06.48 --> 01:34:08.80
This chapter involves the soldiers,

2608
01:34:08.80 --> 01:34:11.32
provides soldiers with these basic techniques

2609
01:34:11.32 --> 01:34:14.36
at basic levels against an unarmed enemy.

2610
01:34:14.36 --> 01:34:16.20
According to circumstances of surrounded conflict,

2611
01:34:16.20 --> 01:34:17.48
fighters can use these techniques

2612
01:34:17.48 --> 01:34:21.40
to disable opponent or force the opponent to submit.

2613
01:34:21.40 --> 01:34:22.32
You know what I'm talking about?

2614
01:34:22.32 --> 01:34:23.16
These four different levels.

2615
01:34:23.16 --> 01:34:25.000
I like that they're in the projectiles.

2616
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.72
That's actually something that's good.

2617
01:34:26.72 --> 01:34:28.08
Boss room, when you say it,

2618
01:34:28.08 --> 01:34:29.64
like you can throw a chair at someone.

2619
01:34:29.64 --> 01:34:30.48
Yeah, for sure.

2620
01:34:30.48 --> 01:34:31.32
And the perfect hand stuff.

2621
01:34:31.32 --> 01:34:32.16
For sure.

2622
01:34:32.16 --> 01:34:33.08
So one thing I noticed,

2623
01:34:34.36 --> 01:34:35.88
muay thai, muay thai,

2624
01:34:35.88 --> 01:34:37.44
which of course is a great, great style.

2625
01:34:37.44 --> 01:34:38.88
Kickboxing, the kick with the shins,

2626
01:34:38.88 --> 01:34:40.36
which that's how I kick.

2627
01:34:40.36 --> 01:34:42.08
But if you have a boot on,

2628
01:34:42.08 --> 01:34:44.12
if you block shin and shin with a shin,

2629
01:34:44.12 --> 01:34:45.16
you have a strong shin, fine.

2630
01:34:45.16 --> 01:34:47.04
But a boot hitting your shin,

2631
01:34:47.04 --> 01:34:48.000
it's an issue, bro.

2632
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
It's an issue.

2633
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.64
So savant from France.

2634
01:34:50.64 --> 01:34:51.76
They have these little, like wrestling,

2635
01:34:51.76 --> 01:34:53.36
with little metal tips though.

2636
01:34:53.36 --> 01:34:54.52
It's like, they're not pointy,

2637
01:34:54.52 --> 01:34:56.24
but if you block muay thai,

2638
01:34:56.24 --> 01:34:58.32
and they have those little shoes on with the metal tip,

2639
01:34:58.32 --> 01:34:59.52
your shin is, it's a problem.

2640
01:34:59.52 --> 01:35:03.40
So interesting, based on how you're dressed, a boot,

2641
01:35:03.40 --> 01:35:04.52
if you block your shin,

2642
01:35:04.52 --> 01:35:05.96
a boot kicking your shin is gonna be,

2643
01:35:05.96 --> 01:35:08.80
let's say not a winning situation for you.

2644
01:35:08.80 --> 01:35:09.80
So I'm just saying that since you get,

2645
01:35:09.80 --> 01:35:12.12
we're looking at now because I'm sure they're not,

2646
01:35:12.12 --> 01:35:13.92
they're thinking about having the uniform on,

2647
01:35:13.92 --> 01:35:16.40
maybe body armor, the boots,

2648
01:35:16.40 --> 01:35:17.92
maybe not a boot, maybe shoes,

2649
01:35:17.92 --> 01:35:19.96
but different, it depends on how you're dressed.

2650
01:35:19.96 --> 01:35:20.84
That's another thing too.

2651
01:35:20.84 --> 01:35:23.08
However, I am on the side of muay thai.

2652
01:35:23.08 --> 01:35:24.000
I'm on the side of, you know,

2653
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.72
there's even this style in Burma where they use head butts.

2654
01:35:26.72 --> 01:35:27.56
It's crazy.

2655
01:35:27.56 --> 01:35:28.68
It's pretty effective, by the way.

2656
01:35:28.68 --> 01:35:30.12
You know, you don't have to throw a head butt.

2657
01:35:30.12 --> 01:35:31.04
This kind of stuff.

2658
01:35:31.04 --> 01:35:33.88
So I do think it's good to get the training with muay thai.

2659
01:35:33.88 --> 01:35:35.44
When you got a helmet on.

2660
01:35:35.44 --> 01:35:36.28
That's true.

2661
01:35:36.28 --> 01:35:37.12
Cause then you can head butt somebody

2662
01:35:37.12 --> 01:35:39.20
and it's like, no damage to you at all.

2663
01:35:39.20 --> 01:35:40.36
And they won't like the result.

2664
01:35:40.36 --> 01:35:41.76
It's a good times.

2665
01:35:41.76 --> 01:35:42.88
Every sip yet.

2666
01:35:42.88 --> 01:35:44.36
You know, so the way, you know,

2667
01:35:44.36 --> 01:35:47.12
but if we spar with boots and you kick in the knees with boot,

2668
01:35:47.12 --> 01:35:47.96
you know, it's gonna hurt,

2669
01:35:47.96 --> 01:35:48.80
you're gonna get hurt real fast.

2670
01:35:48.80 --> 01:35:50.72
Probably can't, it's gonna be more dangerous.

2671
01:35:50.72 --> 01:35:51.68
We spar muay thai.

2672
01:35:51.68 --> 01:35:53.76
You can learn how, in case someone had to do it

2673
01:35:53.76 --> 01:35:54.88
on how to defend it.

2674
01:35:54.88 --> 01:35:56.60
You get the training from muay thai with the tactics

2675
01:35:56.60 --> 01:35:59.96
and let's say the open minded way,

2676
01:35:59.96 --> 01:36:01.44
that maybe the arms showing here,

2677
01:36:01.44 --> 01:36:03.36
and you could adapt tactics for something like that.

2678
01:36:03.36 --> 01:36:04.28
I think it's good.

2679
01:36:04.28 --> 01:36:05.80
I think it's good to add to projectiles.

2680
01:36:05.80 --> 01:36:06.96
It's actually a good detail.

2681
01:36:06.96 --> 01:36:07.80
Well, yeah.

2682
01:36:07.80 --> 01:36:09.36
And by projectiles, they also be guns.

2683
01:36:09.36 --> 01:36:10.20
Oh, okay.

2684
01:36:10.20 --> 01:36:11.04
Yeah.

2685
01:36:11.04 --> 01:36:11.88
That counts the projectile.

2686
01:36:11.88 --> 01:36:13.08
You mean throwing the rifle with someone?

2687
01:36:13.08 --> 01:36:14.42
Yeah.

2688
01:36:14.42 --> 01:36:19.42
Um, here's some, here's some like the basic concepts.

2689
01:36:20.52 --> 01:36:22.24
Create space.

2690
01:36:22.24 --> 01:36:25.40
When in combat, a soldier's primary goal to be established,

2691
01:36:25.40 --> 01:36:29.12
should be to establish space between him and his attacker.

2692
01:36:29.12 --> 01:36:30.56
A soldier must create enough space

2693
01:36:30.56 --> 01:36:32.24
to transition to his primary weapon.

2694
01:36:32.24 --> 01:36:33.36
So there you go.

2695
01:36:34.44 --> 01:36:35.40
Maintain space.

2696
01:36:35.40 --> 01:36:39.08
When in combat, soldiers may be unable to create enough space

2697
01:36:39.08 --> 01:36:40.96
and transition to their primary weapon.

2698
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:41.96
If unable to do so,

2699
01:36:41.96 --> 01:36:43.96
they may need to maintain space to transition

2700
01:36:43.96 --> 01:36:46.02
to their secondary weapon,

2701
01:36:46.02 --> 01:36:47.92
or close the distance gained down at body position

2702
01:36:47.92 --> 01:36:49.52
and finish the fight.

2703
01:36:49.52 --> 01:36:50.48
So you want to create space,

2704
01:36:50.48 --> 01:36:51.44
you want to maintain space,

2705
01:36:51.44 --> 01:36:52.88
you might have to close the distance.

2706
01:36:52.88 --> 01:36:53.88
When training soldiers,

2707
01:36:53.88 --> 01:36:56.28
the primary goal should be instilling the courage

2708
01:36:56.28 --> 01:36:58.20
to close the distance.

2709
01:36:58.20 --> 01:36:59.72
The willingness to close with the enemy

2710
01:36:59.72 --> 01:37:01.72
is a defining characteristic of a warrior,

2711
01:37:01.72 --> 01:37:03.80
and the ability to do so against an aggressive opponent

2712
01:37:03.80 --> 01:37:07.04
is the first step in using range to control a fight.

2713
01:37:07.04 --> 01:37:09.52
This is something that I've talked about so much

2714
01:37:09.52 --> 01:37:10.92
because you get that question all the time.

2715
01:37:10.92 --> 01:37:12.88
Well, is Jiu Jitsu really the best thing for self-defense?

2716
01:37:12.88 --> 01:37:16.16
And you've heard me give this explanation a thousand times.

2717
01:37:16.16 --> 01:37:18.48
If I have space, I don't need any self-defense at all.

2718
01:37:18.48 --> 01:37:20.56
I can get away from you and run away, and that's fine.

2719
01:37:20.56 --> 01:37:22.32
It's when you grab me, that's when we have a problem.

2720
01:37:22.32 --> 01:37:23.48
That's when I better know Jiu Jitsu.

2721
01:37:23.48 --> 01:37:25.88
That's when I better know how to grapple at least.

2722
01:37:26.76 --> 01:37:28.52
Gain, so they say close the distance.

2723
01:37:28.52 --> 01:37:31.20
If you have to, if you can't create space,

2724
01:37:31.20 --> 01:37:32.80
or you can't maintain space,

2725
01:37:32.80 --> 01:37:35.24
the next thing is you actually go on the attack

2726
01:37:35.24 --> 01:37:37.24
and you close the distance, you get in close,

2727
01:37:37.24 --> 01:37:40.16
gain dominant position, and then finish the fight.

2728
01:37:40.16 --> 01:37:43.20
That's the protocol that they give.

2729
01:37:44.60 --> 01:37:46.44
And then it gets into ground grappling.

2730
01:37:47.64 --> 01:37:49.28
Ground grappling provides a sound base.

2731
01:37:49.28 --> 01:37:52.80
And by the way, I'm not reading the whole book, obviously,

2732
01:37:52.80 --> 01:37:56.24
but it's skipping ahead to the ground grappling,

2733
01:37:56.24 --> 01:37:59.88
basic techniques, standing base with a primary weapon,

2734
01:37:59.88 --> 01:38:02.64
fighting stance, opposing grip, thumbs grip,

2735
01:38:02.64 --> 01:38:05.20
wrestlers grip, thumb and thumbless grip,

2736
01:38:06.44 --> 01:38:07.88
dominant body positions, rear mount,

2737
01:38:07.88 --> 01:38:10.88
guard, side control.

2738
01:38:10.88 --> 01:38:13.48
And then it starts giving basic positions, basic moves.

2739
01:38:13.48 --> 01:38:15.20
And it goes through basic finishing moves,

2740
01:38:15.20 --> 01:38:18.20
rear naked choke, cross collar choke from the mount and guard,

2741
01:38:18.20 --> 01:38:20.44
bent arm bar from the mount and side control,

2742
01:38:20.44 --> 01:38:21.44
straight arm bar from the mount,

2743
01:38:21.44 --> 01:38:24.76
straight arm bar from the guard, guillotine choke.

2744
01:38:24.76 --> 01:38:27.40
Blood chokes attack the blood supply to the brain,

2745
01:38:27.40 --> 01:38:29.68
air choke support attack the air supply.

2746
01:38:29.68 --> 01:38:32.36
These chokes will take longer to cause unconsciousness,

2747
01:38:32.36 --> 01:38:37.36
gives joint locks, tapping procedures.

2748
01:38:38.44 --> 01:38:39.28
That's always good.

2749
01:38:39.28 --> 01:38:41.64
I think that's, I failed on that one.

2750
01:38:41.64 --> 01:38:45.84
When I hurt John Dudley, my buddy John Dudley,

2751
01:38:45.84 --> 01:38:46.68
he pushed me.

2752
01:38:46.68 --> 01:38:48.84
No, I didn't give him like a pre-brief.

2753
01:38:48.84 --> 01:38:49.68
Oh, okay.

2754
01:38:49.68 --> 01:38:52.56
You know, like, hey dude, I just assumed

2755
01:38:52.56 --> 01:38:54.72
that he would just tap.

2756
01:38:54.72 --> 01:38:55.72
And it may or may not have helped

2757
01:38:55.72 --> 01:38:57.32
because he was also kind of fired up, you know?

2758
01:38:57.32 --> 01:38:59.60
John Dudley going, going, going to the Zercher mode,

2759
01:38:59.60 --> 01:39:00.44
level nine.

2760
01:39:00.44 --> 01:39:02.04
Oh yeah.

2761
01:39:02.04 --> 01:39:06.28
And he's a great athlete in like 29 different categories.

2762
01:39:06.28 --> 01:39:09.28
So when he was going ham, you know,

2763
01:39:09.28 --> 01:39:13.36
but I didn't give him a good, a good brief.

2764
01:39:13.36 --> 01:39:14.68
So make sure if you're teaching someone,

2765
01:39:14.68 --> 01:39:16.42
you tell them how to tap.

2766
01:39:18.08 --> 01:39:20.60
Then it talks about sweeps and takedowns.

2767
01:39:20.60 --> 01:39:23.36
And, you know, one thing that's interesting

2768
01:39:23.36 --> 01:39:25.48
is it starts giving like how to stand up in base,

2769
01:39:25.48 --> 01:39:27.000
which we all know, but how do you stand up in base?

2770
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.68
Well, the weapon.

2771
01:39:28.68 --> 01:39:30.68
Like that's also something to think about.

2772
01:39:30.68 --> 01:39:33.16
So they address a lot of these things

2773
01:39:33.16 --> 01:39:36.80
that take a little bit of thought

2774
01:39:36.80 --> 01:39:37.88
about how you're going to do it.

2775
01:39:37.88 --> 01:39:39.20
Cause you don't want to put down your weapon

2776
01:39:39.20 --> 01:39:40.20
so you can stand up.

2777
01:39:40.20 --> 01:39:42.06
No, you want to be able to,

2778
01:39:42.06 --> 01:39:43.32
you want to be able to stand up

2779
01:39:43.32 --> 01:39:45.32
while you're still holding your weapon.

2780
01:39:46.64 --> 01:39:48.16
Fast forward a little bit again, you know,

2781
01:39:48.16 --> 01:39:49.76
they talk about the fighting stance.

2782
01:39:49.76 --> 01:39:51.56
And the fighting stance allows the soldier

2783
01:39:51.56 --> 01:39:54.88
to assume an offensive posture conducive to attack

2784
01:39:54.88 --> 01:39:56.84
while still being able to move and defend himself.

2785
01:39:56.84 --> 01:39:58.40
The fighting stance is not only perform

2786
01:39:58.40 --> 01:40:00.24
a platform for unarmed fighting,

2787
01:40:00.24 --> 01:40:02.12
it can also be used for various weapons

2788
01:40:02.12 --> 01:40:05.36
from close range contact weapons to projectile weapons.

2789
01:40:05.36 --> 01:40:06.88
Just detail, man.

2790
01:40:06.88 --> 01:40:08.76
The fighter keeps their chin tucked.

2791
01:40:08.76 --> 01:40:10.28
The fighter looks just beneath their eyebrows

2792
01:40:10.28 --> 01:40:11.12
at the opponent.

2793
01:40:11.12 --> 01:40:11.96
The fighter uses a lead soldier

2794
01:40:11.96 --> 01:40:13.28
to block the side of the face.

2795
01:40:13.28 --> 01:40:16.80
Just squared away, you know, procedures.

2796
01:40:16.80 --> 01:40:19.52
And even the whole book,

2797
01:40:19.52 --> 01:40:23.08
the manual's got every conceivable thing.

2798
01:40:23.08 --> 01:40:25.52
I mean, fast forward here, the mount.

2799
01:40:25.52 --> 01:40:27.56
The mount allows a fighter to strike the opponent

2800
01:40:27.56 --> 01:40:29.60
with punches while restricting the opponent's ability

2801
01:40:29.60 --> 01:40:32.36
to deliver effective return punches.

2802
01:40:32.36 --> 01:40:33.88
The mount provides the leverage to attack

2803
01:40:33.88 --> 01:40:35.68
the opponent's upper body with strokes and joint attack.

2804
01:40:35.68 --> 01:40:40.68
It goes through in detail all these different positions

2805
01:40:41.52 --> 01:40:43.88
and then, you know, the guard.

2806
01:40:45.52 --> 01:40:47.24
And all this stuff is the same stuff we say.

2807
01:40:47.24 --> 01:40:50.48
A fighter never wants to be under their opponent.

2808
01:40:50.48 --> 01:40:52.24
The guard enables them to defend themselves

2809
01:40:52.24 --> 01:40:53.36
and transition off their back

2810
01:40:53.36 --> 01:40:55.24
into a more advantageous position.

2811
01:40:55.24 --> 01:40:56.08
But yeah, that's how it was.

2812
01:40:56.08 --> 01:40:57.16
What are you gonna do with a street fight?

2813
01:40:57.16 --> 01:40:58.000
Pull guard?

2814
01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.80
No one says that.

2815
01:40:59.80 --> 01:41:02.16
Not one person has ever said that in a serious way.

2816
01:41:02.16 --> 01:41:03.68
They might have joked about it,

2817
01:41:03.68 --> 01:41:06.32
but no one says pull guard in a fight.

2818
01:41:06.32 --> 01:41:08.68
Guard means you made a mistake.

2819
01:41:09.80 --> 01:41:10.84
You messed up.

2820
01:41:10.84 --> 01:41:12.08
That's why you're in guard.

2821
01:41:13.84 --> 01:41:16.64
A fighter never wants to be under their opponent.

2822
01:41:16.64 --> 01:41:17.96
Right, exactly.

2823
01:41:17.96 --> 01:41:19.36
We all agree with that.

2824
01:41:20.84 --> 01:41:22.84
The guard allows the bottom fighter to exercise

2825
01:41:22.84 --> 01:41:24.56
a certain amount of control over the range

2826
01:41:24.56 --> 01:41:26.16
by pushing out or pulling in his opponent

2827
01:41:26.16 --> 01:41:27.000
with his hips and legs.

2828
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:27.84
Yes.

2829
01:41:28.76 --> 01:41:29.60
So,

2830
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:31.88
there you go.

2831
01:41:31.88 --> 01:41:35.40
I mean, and it's got tons of detail in this manual.

2832
01:41:36.36 --> 01:41:38.48
And by the way, obviously this manual is unclassified.

2833
01:41:38.48 --> 01:41:40.40
You can find it on the internet.

2834
01:41:40.40 --> 01:41:41.36
But it's there.

2835
01:41:41.36 --> 01:41:43.04
And if you wanna look through it, go look through it.

2836
01:41:43.04 --> 01:41:44.88
Learn, learn some stuff.

2837
01:41:44.88 --> 01:41:48.20
Learn about intermediate ground fighting techniques.

2838
01:41:49.44 --> 01:41:52.40
So then it starts talking about the intermittent fight.

2839
01:41:52.40 --> 01:41:54.64
Their intermediate fight strategy involves adjusting

2840
01:41:54.64 --> 01:41:56.40
the basic fight strategy taught in chapter three,

2841
01:41:56.40 --> 01:41:57.80
to accommodate the unpredictable

2842
01:41:57.80 --> 01:42:00.04
and very, very nature of operations.

2843
01:42:01.84 --> 01:42:03.76
Though learning basic combative techniques

2844
01:42:03.76 --> 01:42:05.20
taught in chapter three,

2845
01:42:05.20 --> 01:42:07.92
soldiers are instilled with basic fight strategy.

2846
01:42:07.92 --> 01:42:10.28
The easiest way to impact a soldier's fighting ability.

2847
01:42:10.28 --> 01:42:11.60
However, soldiers often find themselves

2848
01:42:11.60 --> 01:42:13.08
in unpredictable situations that span

2849
01:42:13.08 --> 01:42:14.04
the spectrum of operations.

2850
01:42:14.04 --> 01:42:15.64
Therefore, soldiers must be prepared

2851
01:42:15.64 --> 01:42:18.24
to adjust their fight strategy to fit the situation

2852
01:42:18.24 --> 01:42:21.44
rather than making every situation fit the preferred strategy.

2853
01:42:21.44 --> 01:42:25.60
So this is telling you to learn more and be adaptable

2854
01:42:25.60 --> 01:42:28.08
and try different scenarios.

2855
01:42:29.36 --> 01:42:32.52
And now you start talking about intermediate mount

2856
01:42:32.52 --> 01:42:34.80
and side control techniques.

2857
01:42:36.56 --> 01:42:39.80
Posting on the arms, posting on the side,

2858
01:42:39.80 --> 01:42:41.28
larger opponent pins.

2859
01:42:41.28 --> 01:42:44.36
This is just getting into more advanced stuff.

2860
01:42:44.36 --> 01:42:46.64
How to pass the guard, attacks from the mount,

2861
01:42:46.64 --> 01:42:47.48
attacks from the rear.

2862
01:42:47.48 --> 01:42:52.48
It's just, it just continues to grow your skill level

2863
01:42:52.48 --> 01:42:56.72
and eventually gets to grappling with strikes.

2864
01:42:57.76 --> 01:43:01.76
Right, so now, it says here,

2865
01:43:01.76 --> 01:43:02.96
leaders should not make the mistake

2866
01:43:02.96 --> 01:43:06.32
of practicing ground fighting techniques exclusively.

2867
01:43:06.32 --> 01:43:08.64
Striking is an integral part of all types of fighting.

2868
01:43:08.64 --> 01:43:11.68
Grappling with open and closed fist strikes,

2869
01:43:11.68 --> 01:43:12.92
force the fighters to ensure

2870
01:43:12.92 --> 01:43:14.76
that they have positive control over their opponent's hands

2871
01:43:14.76 --> 01:43:17.68
which in turn can prevent the fighter's opponent

2872
01:43:17.68 --> 01:43:19.28
from striking them in the face or using weapons.

2873
01:43:19.28 --> 01:43:22.56
This is what's cool about Eddie Bravo's combat jujitsu.

2874
01:43:22.56 --> 01:43:23.56
Right?

2875
01:43:23.56 --> 01:43:26.32
Because there's some positions in jujitsu,

2876
01:43:26.32 --> 01:43:29.16
they work in jujitsu, but if you did them in a fight,

2877
01:43:29.16 --> 01:43:30.28
they're not gonna work so good

2878
01:43:30.28 --> 01:43:31.56
when you're getting punched in the head.

2879
01:43:31.56 --> 01:43:34.52
Especially the palm, not just a slap, palm strikes,

2880
01:43:34.52 --> 01:43:35.36
like a punch.

2881
01:43:35.36 --> 01:43:36.92
They're actually not as bone breaking

2882
01:43:36.92 --> 01:43:40.36
as a punch with knuckles, but they sting more.

2883
01:43:40.36 --> 01:43:42.04
The slaps hurt more than a punch.

2884
01:43:42.04 --> 01:43:43.88
Oh, the slaps definitely hurt more than a punch.

2885
01:43:43.88 --> 01:43:46.16
They don't damage your face as much.

2886
01:43:46.16 --> 01:43:48.76
Like, like cut you, you know,

2887
01:43:48.76 --> 01:43:50.40
break your cheekbone, things like that.

2888
01:43:50.40 --> 01:43:51.48
Well, it's a different kind of pain,

2889
01:43:51.48 --> 01:43:53.36
but I mean, getting punched is fine.

2890
01:43:53.36 --> 01:43:54.76
The palm strike can, but that's,

2891
01:43:54.76 --> 01:43:56.60
ooh, slap man, that's a slap.

2892
01:43:56.60 --> 01:43:58.52
Slap down your chest, your back.

2893
01:43:58.52 --> 01:44:01.28
Oh yeah, the slaps to the ribs,

2894
01:44:01.28 --> 01:44:03.28
the slaps to the ribs is like a torture.

2895
01:44:03.28 --> 01:44:04.80
Jocko myself, he does this many times.

2896
01:44:04.80 --> 01:44:08.20
Like, remember, like, if we're having like one of those days,

2897
01:44:08.20 --> 01:44:10.36
you start pulling the shirt up and bro,

2898
01:44:10.36 --> 01:44:12.56
then we got back and forth, like, we're still bros,

2899
01:44:12.56 --> 01:44:14.48
but we're still like, okay, slap, slap.

2900
01:44:14.48 --> 01:44:16.08
There's like, I think at some point,

2901
01:44:16.08 --> 01:44:18.44
let's just calm down now.

2902
01:44:18.44 --> 01:44:19.28
That's not funny.

2903
01:44:19.28 --> 01:44:21.40
There's an escalation that could occur at some times.

2904
01:44:21.40 --> 01:44:22.48
And unfortunately for me,

2905
01:44:22.48 --> 01:44:24.68
I'm usually getting the raw end of that escalation.

2906
01:44:24.68 --> 01:44:25.68
That depends on the date.

2907
01:44:25.68 --> 01:44:28.24
I have to hope for a piece out there.

2908
01:44:28.24 --> 01:44:29.88
I remember one time when my kid,

2909
01:44:29.88 --> 01:44:34.08
my son was probably like 12 maybe,

2910
01:44:35.04 --> 01:44:39.20
and we were training and I had a bad ankle injury.

2911
01:44:39.20 --> 01:44:44.20
Speaking of Sarge, Sarge shot a single on me

2912
01:44:44.20 --> 01:44:49.20
and like I did something or whatever and it really hurt.

2913
01:44:51.12 --> 01:44:53.40
I was one of the worst injuries I've had.

2914
01:44:53.40 --> 01:44:55.76
And luckily it was Sarge and he like,

2915
01:44:55.76 --> 01:44:57.44
as it was probably gonna break,

2916
01:44:57.44 --> 01:45:01.08
he like released and like, whatever, moved his weight.

2917
01:45:01.08 --> 01:45:04.56
But my ankle's really sprained.

2918
01:45:04.56 --> 01:45:08.04
And so I'm rolling a couple of days later, of course,

2919
01:45:08.04 --> 01:45:08.88
because that's what we're doing.

2920
01:45:08.88 --> 01:45:10.16
I had like one of that, you know,

2921
01:45:10.16 --> 01:45:13.92
the ankle braces that like lace up.

2922
01:45:13.92 --> 01:45:16.12
They're super tight and they have like a,

2923
01:45:16.12 --> 01:45:17.88
so I had one of those things on.

2924
01:45:17.88 --> 01:45:20.48
So I'm rolling with my son and he's like 12.

2925
01:45:21.68 --> 01:45:24.24
And you know, I like get side control

2926
01:45:24.24 --> 01:45:26.56
or something like half guard, I'm in half guard.

2927
01:45:26.56 --> 01:45:28.48
And I like pull his shirt up a little bit

2928
01:45:28.48 --> 01:45:32.48
and I slap him right on the ribs, that painful spot.

2929
01:45:32.48 --> 01:45:33.72
Yeah.

2930
01:45:33.72 --> 01:45:35.64
And you can see he's trying to move.

2931
01:45:35.64 --> 01:45:38.68
And he can't really, you can see it's like mad, right?

2932
01:45:38.68 --> 01:45:39.52
And then you know, whatever,

2933
01:45:39.52 --> 01:45:40.44
a transition to another position,

2934
01:45:40.44 --> 01:45:43.36
he let him get up on top or whatever.

2935
01:45:43.36 --> 01:45:46.60
He dives on a toehold.

2936
01:45:47.60 --> 01:45:50.52
He dives on a toehold on my injured foot.

2937
01:45:51.56 --> 01:45:54.76
And you know, quite frankly, I probably should have tapped.

2938
01:45:56.08 --> 01:45:58.000
I probably should have tapped,

2939
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.56
but obviously there was no way I was tapping to my own son.

2940
01:46:02.56 --> 01:46:05.60
So I like escape that.

2941
01:46:05.60 --> 01:46:07.72
And this is the, I've told you this story before.

2942
01:46:07.72 --> 01:46:12.32
So then I got across side and I was like,

2943
01:46:12.32 --> 01:46:16.16
and I started, I did the paper cutter choke.

2944
01:46:16.16 --> 01:46:17.000
Wiki?

2945
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.08
Yeah.

2946
01:46:18.08 --> 01:46:20.88
And I go, I said something like,

2947
01:46:20.88 --> 01:46:23.80
hey, I'm injured, you idiot.

2948
01:46:24.64 --> 01:46:27.80
Do you want, don't, don't attack someone

2949
01:46:27.80 --> 01:46:31.16
that's injured in their injured area and try to hurt them.

2950
01:46:31.16 --> 01:46:32.76
Do you understand?

2951
01:46:32.76 --> 01:46:33.60
Sorry, yes sir.

2952
01:46:33.60 --> 01:46:35.80
No, he didn't answer it.

2953
01:46:35.80 --> 01:46:39.16
He's just looking at me and I'm looking at him

2954
01:46:39.16 --> 01:46:40.60
and I go, do you understand?

2955
01:46:40.60 --> 01:46:43.40
And he's still pissed that I slapped him, right?

2956
01:46:43.40 --> 01:46:45.36
So I started applying the choke

2957
01:46:47.16 --> 01:46:48.20
and I'm applying it hard.

2958
01:46:48.20 --> 01:46:49.40
And I'm like, do you understand?

2959
01:46:49.40 --> 01:46:50.56
He's still just looking at me.

2960
01:46:50.56 --> 01:46:52.12
I'm like, okay, I'm gonna kill him.

2961
01:46:53.12 --> 01:46:54.88
But I'm like, okay, test of wills.

2962
01:46:54.88 --> 01:46:56.36
He's gonna have to die.

2963
01:46:56.36 --> 01:46:57.20
That's it.

2964
01:46:57.20 --> 01:46:58.28
So I start, you know how you know

2965
01:46:58.28 --> 01:46:59.56
that paper cutter choke, you go down,

2966
01:46:59.56 --> 01:47:00.72
then you start going out.

2967
01:47:00.72 --> 01:47:03.52
I was down and now I'm going out.

2968
01:47:03.52 --> 01:47:05.24
And he's starting to turn red and purple

2969
01:47:05.24 --> 01:47:06.84
and find he's like, I understand.

2970
01:47:06.84 --> 01:47:07.68
I was like, what?

2971
01:47:07.68 --> 01:47:08.68
He's like, I understand.

2972
01:47:08.68 --> 01:47:09.52
And I was like, okay.

2973
01:47:09.52 --> 01:47:11.12
And then we just kept trading, you know?

2974
01:47:11.12 --> 01:47:12.64
But yeah, do.

2975
01:47:12.64 --> 01:47:14.36
You had that coming to you by the way.

2976
01:47:14.36 --> 01:47:16.32
Oh, I definitely had it coming to me.

2977
01:47:17.28 --> 01:47:20.28
Although, yeah, I had it coming to me.

2978
01:47:20.28 --> 01:47:22.84
There's a debate of principle for sure,

2979
01:47:22.84 --> 01:47:24.80
but you had it coming to you.

2980
01:47:25.72 --> 01:47:27.16
Wait, what?

2981
01:47:27.16 --> 01:47:28.48
Why?

2982
01:47:28.48 --> 01:47:29.32
The slap thing on the phone.

2983
01:47:29.32 --> 01:47:31.60
The slap thing, even though the slap thing

2984
01:47:31.60 --> 01:47:34.84
is still done in fun, right?

2985
01:47:34.84 --> 01:47:36.76
There's still a level of fun to it.

2986
01:47:36.76 --> 01:47:39.40
There's no fun about trying to hurt someone that's injured.

2987
01:47:39.40 --> 01:47:40.24
Yeah.

2988
01:47:41.12 --> 01:47:43.60
Yeah, but the argument could be made.

2989
01:47:43.60 --> 01:47:45.08
Hey, look, I'm not your son.

2990
01:47:45.08 --> 01:47:46.28
I'm not you, so I don't know.

2991
01:47:46.28 --> 01:47:50.84
But maybe some of us didn't sign up for that fun that day.

2992
01:47:50.84 --> 01:47:52.28
You see what I'm saying?

2993
01:47:52.28 --> 01:47:53.52
That's good that it's fun for you.

2994
01:47:53.52 --> 01:47:54.36
It really is.

2995
01:47:54.36 --> 01:47:55.20
Congratulations.

2996
01:47:55.20 --> 01:47:56.20
You know what though?

2997
01:47:56.20 --> 01:47:58.24
You gotta learn to control those emotions a little bit.

2998
01:47:58.24 --> 01:47:59.28
It's part of the process.

2999
01:47:59.28 --> 01:48:00.88
It's part of the process.

3000
01:48:00.88 --> 01:48:04.04
Remember when you were back at City Boxing,

3001
01:48:04.04 --> 01:48:04.88
came back from wherever.

3002
01:48:04.88 --> 01:48:06.60
You had like Tom, you had Grady Mack,

3003
01:48:06.60 --> 01:48:08.48
you had, you know, you had all these guys in the man,

3004
01:48:08.48 --> 01:48:10.12
like 10 seals, you had one Marine,

3005
01:48:10.12 --> 01:48:11.88
who was the force we got?

3006
01:48:11.88 --> 01:48:12.72
The H.

3007
01:48:12.72 --> 01:48:13.56
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3008
01:48:13.56 --> 01:48:15.16
And you got training, I was slapping them.

3009
01:48:15.16 --> 01:48:17.000
Like because they were down with it,

3010
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.40
because they were getting ready for like deployment.

3011
01:48:18.40 --> 01:48:21.24
There was like, and I was talking smack to them.

3012
01:48:21.24 --> 01:48:25.48
I'm like, request permission to go back to base.

3013
01:48:25.48 --> 01:48:27.12
Mission not accomplished.

3014
01:48:27.12 --> 01:48:29.04
Like, no, say it.

3015
01:48:29.04 --> 01:48:31.24
Mission scrubbed, request permission.

3016
01:48:31.24 --> 01:48:32.40
Anyways, that was a game.

3017
01:48:32.40 --> 01:48:34.28
But then again, there was just some fired up guys

3018
01:48:34.28 --> 01:48:35.32
and it was like the game.

3019
01:48:35.32 --> 01:48:37.44
So the average person, I wouldn't, you know,

3020
01:48:37.44 --> 01:48:38.60
just to crack across the body.

3021
01:48:38.60 --> 01:48:42.16
But the sun, yeah, injured foot, understood.

3022
01:48:42.16 --> 01:48:43.64
What's your assessment?

3023
01:48:43.64 --> 01:48:44.96
Echo says I'm wrong.

3024
01:48:46.28 --> 01:48:48.16
It's kind of mutual, like you and I,

3025
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:49.64
we do it because we think it's funny,

3026
01:48:49.64 --> 01:48:50.96
it's statistically funny.

3027
01:48:50.96 --> 01:48:52.08
By the way, Jocko has his days,

3028
01:48:52.08 --> 01:48:54.68
he makes me feel kind of ashamed sometimes.

3029
01:48:54.68 --> 01:48:56.000
I understand.

3030
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.20
But I mean, it's a mutual thing.

3031
01:48:57.20 --> 01:48:58.04
It's just different.

3032
01:48:58.04 --> 01:48:59.36
I don't know why.

3033
01:48:59.36 --> 01:49:00.52
I don't know for such a long time.

3034
01:49:00.52 --> 01:49:01.60
We've always trained that way.

3035
01:49:01.60 --> 01:49:02.92
We've always trained that way, for sure.

3036
01:49:02.92 --> 01:49:03.76
Wrist, whatever.

3037
01:49:03.76 --> 01:49:06.28
You know what, okay, so this is, I think this is true.

3038
01:49:06.28 --> 01:49:07.96
You know, rattlesnakes, right?

3039
01:49:07.96 --> 01:49:10.12
When they're like not full grown,

3040
01:49:10.12 --> 01:49:12.56
when they bite, they say they're more kind of dangerous,

3041
01:49:12.56 --> 01:49:14.44
right, because they can't control their venom.

3042
01:49:14.44 --> 01:49:16.76
So consider your 12 year old kid, right?

3043
01:49:16.76 --> 01:49:18.000
You're like, okay, we're going,

3044
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.72
we're going street level or whatever, right?

3045
01:49:19.72 --> 01:49:22.28
Because there's such thing as street rules.

3046
01:49:22.28 --> 01:49:23.76
So okay, we're going street rules.

3047
01:49:23.76 --> 01:49:25.56
And that's what I would say the slap is.

3048
01:49:25.56 --> 01:49:29.04
I mean, it's usually mutual and kind of understood

3049
01:49:29.04 --> 01:49:29.88
in this way.

3050
01:49:29.88 --> 01:49:30.96
But someone might misunderstood it

3051
01:49:30.96 --> 01:49:32.48
and they just go hand-back like really hard.

3052
01:49:32.48 --> 01:49:35.16
Exactly, you don't just do it to anybody.

3053
01:49:35.16 --> 01:49:37.92
So, yeah, I'm not rolling like a random person in.

3054
01:49:37.92 --> 01:49:38.76
Yeah, certainly.

3055
01:49:38.76 --> 01:49:39.60
You think he is.

3056
01:49:39.60 --> 01:49:40.92
Has to be your friend or your enemy.

3057
01:49:40.92 --> 01:49:41.76
Friend or enemy.

3058
01:49:41.76 --> 01:49:43.32
And why don't we do it to anybody?

3059
01:49:43.32 --> 01:49:45.84
No, actually, you wouldn't even really slap,

3060
01:49:45.84 --> 01:49:48.36
rib slap your enemy.

3061
01:49:48.36 --> 01:49:50.20
That's sort of like don't move, right?

3062
01:49:50.20 --> 01:49:53.84
This is just like, you know, general friendly harassment.

3063
01:49:53.84 --> 01:49:56.48
Right, yeah, friendly harassment, exactly, right.

3064
01:49:56.48 --> 01:49:58.96
So, but the reason you don't do it to like a stranger

3065
01:49:58.96 --> 01:50:01.04
or something is like you don't know the reaction.

3066
01:50:01.04 --> 01:50:03.40
They don't, they're not under that element of control

3067
01:50:03.40 --> 01:50:04.52
that your friends are.

3068
01:50:04.52 --> 01:50:08.000
Now, 12 year old kid who's to say where he's at mentally.

3069
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.04
Is he saying?

3070
01:50:09.04 --> 01:50:09.88
Apparently.

3071
01:50:09.88 --> 01:50:11.20
Apparently he's in the vengeance mode.

3072
01:50:11.20 --> 01:50:13.36
He is like a little rattlesnake where he's like,

3073
01:50:13.36 --> 01:50:14.96
okay, we were taking it to that level.

3074
01:50:14.96 --> 01:50:15.80
We'll take it to that level.

3075
01:50:15.80 --> 01:50:16.64
He didn't know though.

3076
01:50:16.64 --> 01:50:18.64
He didn't know what that means as far as the translation

3077
01:50:18.64 --> 01:50:20.08
to what he can do, you know?

3078
01:50:20.08 --> 01:50:21.96
So he's just going for, what's he going for?

3079
01:50:21.96 --> 01:50:22.80
He's going to put a little.

3080
01:50:22.80 --> 01:50:23.64
Bro jumping on that toehold.

3081
01:50:23.64 --> 01:50:24.64
Yeah, yeah, all day.

3082
01:50:24.64 --> 01:50:25.64
And cranky.

3083
01:50:26.96 --> 01:50:27.80
Like I said.

3084
01:50:27.80 --> 01:50:28.64
Cranky.

3085
01:50:28.64 --> 01:50:29.96
You had that coming to you, sir.

3086
01:50:31.96 --> 01:50:33.60
I don't know, man.

3087
01:50:33.60 --> 01:50:36.60
I guess, no, I see, you're probably right, man.

3088
01:50:36.60 --> 01:50:37.68
Yeah.

3089
01:50:37.68 --> 01:50:38.52
A toehold for anyone.

3090
01:50:38.52 --> 01:50:41.48
But to me, that escalation, I guess, you know what it is?

3091
01:50:41.48 --> 01:50:44.20
Part of it is for me, this was just like,

3092
01:50:44.20 --> 01:50:45.92
a way to make things more fun.

3093
01:50:45.92 --> 01:50:46.76
Yeah.

3094
01:50:46.76 --> 01:50:47.84
I would actually agree with that.

3095
01:50:47.84 --> 01:50:51.52
You know, like Dean, Dean, like there's a certain level of,

3096
01:50:51.52 --> 01:50:54.44
if Dean and I get in that zone, there's a certain level of,

3097
01:50:54.44 --> 01:50:56.64
it's just a way to make it a little bit more fun,

3098
01:50:56.64 --> 01:50:58.24
a little bit more consequences.

3099
01:50:58.24 --> 01:50:59.08
Yeah.

3100
01:50:59.08 --> 01:51:00.80
The other day, training in charcoal.

3101
01:51:00.80 --> 01:51:02.96
Like I was having a good day and I'm like,

3102
01:51:02.96 --> 01:51:04.32
neon, we call it park bench.

3103
01:51:04.32 --> 01:51:05.16
Remember park bench?

3104
01:51:05.16 --> 01:51:07.36
So your shin is in the face.

3105
01:51:07.36 --> 01:51:08.64
You can't move and I'm like, all right, sir,

3106
01:51:08.64 --> 01:51:09.48
straighten your legs.

3107
01:51:09.48 --> 01:51:12.72
Like I'm trying to make him like lie against the wall straight,

3108
01:51:12.72 --> 01:51:14.08
but he won't let me do it.

3109
01:51:14.08 --> 01:51:18.84
So you're bending, just like your back's on the wall,

3110
01:51:18.84 --> 01:51:20.80
you're on your side and someone's shin is in your face

3111
01:51:20.80 --> 01:51:22.20
and your stomach, you're just like, fuck man.

3112
01:51:22.20 --> 01:51:23.64
It's called park bench.

3113
01:51:23.64 --> 01:51:26.52
It's worse than the other stomach is a very demoralizing

3114
01:51:26.52 --> 01:51:27.36
situation.

3115
01:51:27.36 --> 01:51:29.16
Jocko did it back to me, of course, but yeah,

3116
01:51:29.16 --> 01:51:30.24
it just makes it fun, you know?

3117
01:51:30.24 --> 01:51:31.68
And it looks real bad too.

3118
01:51:31.68 --> 01:51:32.52
Yeah, it looks pretty bad.

3119
01:51:32.52 --> 01:51:34.20
It's called park bench.

3120
01:51:34.20 --> 01:51:36.32
Humiliation levels high for that one.

3121
01:51:36.32 --> 01:51:37.16
Yeah.

3122
01:51:37.16 --> 01:51:39.04
When you're in the bottom, you're like,

3123
01:51:39.04 --> 01:51:41.96
you feel like, I don't know why I'm here, bro.

3124
01:51:41.96 --> 01:51:43.44
I made several mistakes too.

3125
01:51:43.44 --> 01:51:44.80
Yeah.

3126
01:51:44.80 --> 01:51:48.64
For anyone not aware, a toe hold is basically grabbing

3127
01:51:48.64 --> 01:51:51.04
like your toe and doing that, but for your toe.

3128
01:51:51.04 --> 01:51:52.92
And it's actually, your arm is more flexible

3129
01:51:52.92 --> 01:51:54.64
than your ankle or your knee.

3130
01:51:54.64 --> 01:51:56.44
So it's actually, it can't be a damaging move

3131
01:51:56.44 --> 01:51:58.36
for anyone wondering what a toe hold is.

3132
01:51:58.36 --> 01:52:00.32
Grabbing the toe, twisting the ankle,

3133
01:52:00.32 --> 01:52:02.20
therefore the knee as well.

3134
01:52:02.20 --> 01:52:05.20
For the record, I don't think necessarily

3135
01:52:05.20 --> 01:52:06.52
that you were in the wrong.

3136
01:52:06.52 --> 01:52:10.000
In fact, I think that your son was kind of technically

3137
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
in the wrong, but a little rattlesnake,

3138
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.60
you can't expect him to control,

3139
01:52:13.60 --> 01:52:15.36
he did to know the line all definitely.

3140
01:52:15.36 --> 01:52:16.80
Who was tactical, who was strategical?

3141
01:52:16.80 --> 01:52:18.52
Which one was tactical and strategic?

3142
01:52:18.52 --> 01:52:19.36
Was that a strategic?

3143
01:52:19.36 --> 01:52:20.80
Strategic versus tactical.

3144
01:52:20.80 --> 01:52:23.36
He's trying to make him to a tougher, better fighter.

3145
01:52:23.36 --> 01:52:27.08
Yeah, technically, was it a good?

3146
01:52:27.08 --> 01:52:28.88
Tactically, maybe I shouldn't have let him out.

3147
01:52:28.88 --> 01:52:32.76
I'm a long lasting lesson.

3148
01:52:32.76 --> 01:52:36.000
Imagine the thing that I will say is like,

3149
01:52:36.88 --> 01:52:38.68
it surprised me, right?

3150
01:52:38.68 --> 01:52:41.44
It surprised me that he dove on the toe hold.

3151
01:52:41.44 --> 01:52:42.56
Yeah.

3152
01:52:42.56 --> 01:52:45.000
Cause he had the weird combination

3153
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.44
of Dean Lister and Jeff Glover game.

3154
01:52:48.44 --> 01:52:51.08
You know, cause he would train with Dean Lister

3155
01:52:51.08 --> 01:52:52.68
and Jeff Glover, so he had these weird heel hooks

3156
01:52:52.68 --> 01:52:55.16
and like toe holds and then he's like doing weird,

3157
01:52:55.16 --> 01:52:56.12
flexible things.

3158
01:52:56.12 --> 01:52:58.20
So anyways, go watch out for that stuff.

3159
01:52:58.20 --> 01:53:00.08
There is this element too.

3160
01:53:00.08 --> 01:53:01.84
Where I kind of went over this with you

3161
01:53:01.84 --> 01:53:05.16
real briefly one time in our whole life where,

3162
01:53:05.16 --> 01:53:08.000
okay, so, and Dean, you could probably understand this too.

3163
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.44
Okay, let's say we roll, right?

3164
01:53:09.44 --> 01:53:12.000
And I, in my mind, I just know, I believe like,

3165
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.72
you're just so much better than me

3166
01:53:13.72 --> 01:53:15.60
and we're rolling, I'm just trying to, you know,

3167
01:53:15.60 --> 01:53:16.48
but at the end of the day,

3168
01:53:16.48 --> 01:53:18.36
I know like you're just so much better than me.

3169
01:53:18.36 --> 01:53:21.80
I'm 12 years old, or me and you're, you or whatever, right?

3170
01:53:21.80 --> 01:53:23.60
Let's say, okay, you tapped me out, Dean,

3171
01:53:23.60 --> 01:53:25.20
you tapped me out real quick and then I'm like,

3172
01:53:25.20 --> 01:53:29.24
oh man, cool, and then I like act like I'm gonna walk away

3173
01:53:29.24 --> 01:53:31.96
and then I jump on your back and we start rolling again.

3174
01:53:31.96 --> 01:53:33.92
Right, just kind of like half joking,

3175
01:53:33.92 --> 01:53:35.36
but we still go and roll or whatever.

3176
01:53:35.36 --> 01:53:37.12
You kind of concede a little bit where it's like,

3177
01:53:37.12 --> 01:53:38.32
okay, I see what's going on.

3178
01:53:38.32 --> 01:53:40.36
Like we're in a real training scenario,

3179
01:53:40.36 --> 01:53:41.80
we wouldn't do that, right?

3180
01:53:41.80 --> 01:53:43.40
So, Dean's gonna escalate.

3181
01:53:43.40 --> 01:53:45.08
Yeah, and he can escalate, he can figure it,

3182
01:53:45.08 --> 01:53:45.92
but I'm saying that.

3183
01:53:45.92 --> 01:53:47.24
Because what you did was an escalation, by the way.

3184
01:53:47.24 --> 01:53:48.76
Yes, but it's half joking.

3185
01:53:48.76 --> 01:53:49.60
You see what I'm saying?

3186
01:53:49.60 --> 01:53:52.08
It's like, hey, what's not over there?

3187
01:53:52.08 --> 01:53:52.92
And then you jump on it.

3188
01:53:52.92 --> 01:53:53.76
Yeah, I do that all the time.

3189
01:53:53.76 --> 01:53:54.60
Yes, yes, exactly.

3190
01:53:54.60 --> 01:53:56.24
The time, yeah, exactly.

3191
01:53:56.24 --> 01:53:57.76
Exactly right, so.

3192
01:53:57.76 --> 01:53:58.60
Yeah.

3193
01:53:58.60 --> 01:54:03.52
Now, see, there's a legitimate, like you escalated.

3194
01:54:03.52 --> 01:54:04.84
If you just jumped to someone's back,

3195
01:54:04.84 --> 01:54:06.40
even though you quote unquote or joking,

3196
01:54:06.40 --> 01:54:08.52
you still got their back and now you're trying to choke them.

3197
01:54:08.52 --> 01:54:10.08
What's funny is that's exactly what he said.

3198
01:54:10.08 --> 01:54:10.92
You know what I'm saying?

3199
01:54:10.92 --> 01:54:13.84
And he was like, you indicate, I forget your words,

3200
01:54:13.84 --> 01:54:16.44
but you indicated that like, like, don't do that.

3201
01:54:16.44 --> 01:54:17.36
Like, we're not trying, like.

3202
01:54:17.36 --> 01:54:19.000
Oh, you mean you did it to me for real?

3203
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Yeah, oh yeah, a big problem.

3204
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.76
I used to always do that kind of stuff to you.

3205
01:54:21.76 --> 01:54:24.28
And then I was like, hey, bro, what did I say?

3206
01:54:24.28 --> 01:54:25.12
Did I say something?

3207
01:54:25.12 --> 01:54:25.96
That's weird.

3208
01:54:25.96 --> 01:54:28.52
And when we actually talked about it, you're like,

3209
01:54:28.52 --> 01:54:29.96
you, I forget your exact words,

3210
01:54:29.96 --> 01:54:31.56
but you weren't down for that.

3211
01:54:31.56 --> 01:54:33.28
It's like, it's not as that bad.

3212
01:54:33.28 --> 01:54:36.24
You founded me, you called me out.

3213
01:54:36.24 --> 01:54:37.80
Put it this way.

3214
01:54:37.80 --> 01:54:41.000
I was surprised because it's not like you did anything.

3215
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.68
You know, it's not like you said, hey, don't, you know,

3216
01:54:42.68 --> 01:54:43.72
don't do that or nothing.

3217
01:54:43.72 --> 01:54:44.92
Cause you never said anything like that.

3218
01:54:44.92 --> 01:54:46.64
But when you indicated, oh yeah, you're not down for that.

3219
01:54:46.64 --> 01:54:49.52
I understood, but you have to understand,

3220
01:54:49.52 --> 01:54:51.88
I wouldn't do that if we had a real competitive.

3221
01:54:51.88 --> 01:54:53.68
It was like, you're so much better than me.

3222
01:54:53.68 --> 01:54:55.24
So yeah, I'm gonna jump on your back.

3223
01:54:55.24 --> 01:54:56.84
And I still don't expect to get the better,

3224
01:54:56.84 --> 01:54:58.68
even if I jump on your back because you're so much,

3225
01:54:58.68 --> 01:55:00.44
it's like that attitude, I think.

3226
01:55:00.44 --> 01:55:02.36
So that could have been what your son

3227
01:55:02.36 --> 01:55:04.28
had in his mind a little bit too though.

3228
01:55:04.28 --> 01:55:05.12
Seems like-

3229
01:55:05.12 --> 01:55:05.96
You're gonna go for it.

3230
01:55:05.96 --> 01:55:08.68
Yeah, like, I mean, obviously Dean's not gonna do that.

3231
01:55:08.68 --> 01:55:10.000
Dean will do that.

3232
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.96
If you go for your injured, you're hell yeah.

3233
01:55:11.96 --> 01:55:12.80
No, no, no.

3234
01:55:16.52 --> 01:55:17.36
There you go.

3235
01:55:17.36 --> 01:55:18.20
There's some protocols.

3236
01:55:18.20 --> 01:55:19.04
There's some etiquettes, right?

3237
01:55:19.04 --> 01:55:19.88
etiquette.

3238
01:55:19.88 --> 01:55:20.72
Sometimes gets violated.

3239
01:55:20.72 --> 01:55:21.56
Sometimes it's grayers.

3240
01:55:21.56 --> 01:55:22.84
I may, I'm probably wrong.

3241
01:55:22.84 --> 01:55:24.92
Kid 12 should be nicer.

3242
01:55:24.92 --> 01:55:27.08
Should've been a nicer dad.

3243
01:55:27.08 --> 01:55:27.92
Sorry about that.

3244
01:55:27.92 --> 01:55:28.76
Yeah, kid.

3245
01:55:31.40 --> 01:55:33.64
Yeah, we talked about grappling with strikes and all that.

3246
01:55:33.64 --> 01:55:35.32
It goes through some of those things.

3247
01:55:35.32 --> 01:55:38.16
And then it gets into like advanced ground fighting

3248
01:55:38.16 --> 01:55:41.04
techniques and North-South escapes and North-South.

3249
01:55:41.04 --> 01:55:44.12
Like all those things, chain attacks

3250
01:55:44.12 --> 01:55:45.68
and how everything's connected.

3251
01:55:45.68 --> 01:55:48.12
So, so leg attacks, Dean Lister.

3252
01:55:48.12 --> 01:55:50.72
This section covers the advanced leg attacks.

3253
01:55:50.72 --> 01:55:53.36
These techniques are taught as a way to change

3254
01:55:53.36 --> 01:55:56.32
the fighter's position into a submission.

3255
01:55:56.32 --> 01:55:57.80
Although the techniques are advanced,

3256
01:55:57.80 --> 01:55:59.68
they still present the same amount of hazard

3257
01:55:59.68 --> 01:56:02.04
as attacks learned at lower levels.

3258
01:56:02.04 --> 01:56:05.56
So we got some ideas behind that as well.

3259
01:56:06.72 --> 01:56:09.04
Reading and opponents moves.

3260
01:56:09.04 --> 01:56:11.36
I mean, this is just a thorough,

3261
01:56:11.36 --> 01:56:16.36
a very thorough book about combatives.

3262
01:56:16.36 --> 01:56:18.48
And they just did a good, great job with it.

3263
01:56:18.48 --> 01:56:22.84
And a lot of the theories that are in here just cover

3264
01:56:24.84 --> 01:56:28.04
what we know and they do it in a very professional way.

3265
01:56:28.04 --> 01:56:28.88
Yeah.

3266
01:56:28.88 --> 01:56:29.72
In a very thorough way.

3267
01:56:29.72 --> 01:56:33.08
And the last thing that it talks about is competition

3268
01:56:33.08 --> 01:56:38.08
and the spirit of competition, the competition principles.

3269
01:56:39.20 --> 01:56:41.36
He says, this is an important, two things.

3270
01:56:41.36 --> 01:56:42.20
We'll finish with this.

3271
01:56:42.20 --> 01:56:44.76
Combatives techniques are too dangerous for the fighter.

3272
01:56:44.76 --> 01:56:47.80
Combatives techniques are too dangerous for competition.

3273
01:56:47.80 --> 01:56:49.36
Although many techniques are too dangerous

3274
01:56:49.36 --> 01:56:51.48
for live competition, many benefits can be gained

3275
01:56:51.48 --> 01:56:54.40
by competing even when using a limited set of techniques.

3276
01:56:54.40 --> 01:56:56.68
So there are some things that are too dangerous.

3277
01:56:58.12 --> 01:57:00.64
And then it says risks of competition

3278
01:57:00.64 --> 01:57:01.88
outweigh the benefits.

3279
01:57:01.88 --> 01:57:04.44
Many programs have failed because there was no motivation

3280
01:57:04.44 --> 01:57:05.28
to train.

3281
01:57:05.28 --> 01:57:07.88
Competitions are a useful tool to motivate both soldiers

3282
01:57:07.88 --> 01:57:11.28
and unit leaders to emphasize combatives training.

3283
01:57:11.28 --> 01:57:15.36
So competition, very important.

3284
01:57:15.36 --> 01:57:18.32
And there you have it.

3285
01:57:19.60 --> 01:57:24.60
Like I said, great document, outstanding job by the Army

3286
01:57:24.76 --> 01:57:26.64
for moving in that direction.

3287
01:57:26.64 --> 01:57:27.48
Absolutely incredible.

3288
01:57:27.48 --> 01:57:28.32
Yeah.

3289
01:57:28.32 --> 01:57:29.96
And the Marine Corps has the McMap.

3290
01:57:29.96 --> 01:57:30.96
We could go through that.

3291
01:57:30.96 --> 01:57:32.44
The Marine Corps, the Mars Large Program,

3292
01:57:32.44 --> 01:57:33.96
the I Know Special Operations.

3293
01:57:33.96 --> 01:57:34.80
While I know in the SEAL teams,

3294
01:57:34.80 --> 01:57:39.24
we moved in that direction as well around the same,

3295
01:57:39.24 --> 01:57:40.80
actually I don't know, time-wise,

3296
01:57:40.80 --> 01:57:43.96
but we all end up in the same place.

3297
01:57:43.96 --> 01:57:47.76
And you know the theory here is like you gotta compete,

3298
01:57:47.76 --> 01:57:50.12
you gotta learn, you gotta test, you gotta get better.

3299
01:57:50.12 --> 01:57:52.72
You know what I'm saying, keep it real.

3300
01:57:52.72 --> 01:57:53.56
Yeah.

3301
01:57:53.56 --> 01:57:54.40
You ever say that, Echo?

3302
01:57:54.40 --> 01:57:55.72
You ever say, hey, keep it real?

3303
01:57:55.72 --> 01:57:57.04
I say it from time to time, yes sir.

3304
01:57:57.04 --> 01:57:59.04
Dean, you ever say keep it real?

3305
01:57:59.04 --> 01:58:00.12
High school maybe.

3306
01:58:00.12 --> 01:58:02.64
I actually say keep it real.

3307
01:58:02.64 --> 01:58:05.20
Like almost, and I kinda just throw it out there.

3308
01:58:05.20 --> 01:58:07.000
Like if I'm, you know, someone goes, hey, what's up?

3309
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.12
I'll be like, oh, you keeping it real?

3310
01:58:08.12 --> 01:58:08.96
Like that?

3311
01:58:08.96 --> 01:58:10.12
You know, kinda just whatever.

3312
01:58:10.12 --> 01:58:10.96
Sure.

3313
01:58:10.96 --> 01:58:11.96
Kind of a throw away comment.

3314
01:58:11.96 --> 01:58:12.80
Sure.

3315
01:58:13.84 --> 01:58:15.44
But I was thinking about it,

3316
01:58:15.44 --> 01:58:18.08
it's actually a good attitude to have.

3317
01:58:18.08 --> 01:58:22.48
With combatives, with fighting, with life, keep it real.

3318
01:58:22.48 --> 01:58:24.40
And that's what I think this does, keep it real.

3319
01:58:24.40 --> 01:58:26.12
Don't allow for the lies.

3320
01:58:27.16 --> 01:58:28.56
The lies.

3321
01:58:28.56 --> 01:58:31.000
You gotta test, you gotta learn, you gotta adapt,

3322
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
you gotta improve, then you gotta retest.

3323
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.20
And you can do that with fighting

3324
01:58:34.20 --> 01:58:36.76
and you can do that with everything in life.

3325
01:58:36.76 --> 01:58:38.16
And that's how we become better fighters

3326
01:58:38.16 --> 01:58:41.04
and that's how we become better people.

3327
01:58:41.04 --> 01:58:42.08
Yeah.

3328
01:58:42.08 --> 01:58:43.72
So that's my recommendation, man.

3329
01:58:44.76 --> 01:58:46.20
Train, get out there.

3330
01:58:48.16 --> 01:58:49.36
Anything else on combatives?

3331
01:58:49.36 --> 01:58:50.28
Dean List.

3332
01:58:50.28 --> 01:58:51.12
Combatives.

3333
01:58:51.92 --> 01:58:55.24
Well, we're looking at that fine balance of training.

3334
01:58:55.24 --> 01:58:57.24
Something you can train, you can replicate over and over

3335
01:58:57.24 --> 01:58:59.48
without getting really injured or hurt.

3336
01:59:01.48 --> 01:59:04.04
With also including some realism

3337
01:59:04.04 --> 01:59:06.40
as far as getting ready for the actual threat

3338
01:59:06.40 --> 01:59:07.56
that you will face.

3339
01:59:07.56 --> 01:59:11.20
Such as, by the way, if you grapple on concrete all the time,

3340
01:59:11.20 --> 01:59:12.36
it's gonna suck.

3341
01:59:12.36 --> 01:59:13.72
Now, you wanna be aware, for instance,

3342
01:59:13.72 --> 01:59:17.40
one time actually I fell for some reason

3343
01:59:17.40 --> 01:59:20.12
on the concrete with my hand, broke my hand

3344
01:59:20.12 --> 01:59:22.12
because we have mats.

3345
01:59:22.12 --> 01:59:24.64
So I actually, I know how to fight if it's on mats,

3346
01:59:24.64 --> 01:59:26.60
but I made a mistake.

3347
01:59:26.60 --> 01:59:28.20
I should open my hands at the right time.

3348
01:59:28.20 --> 01:59:29.76
These are things that have to keep in mind,

3349
01:59:29.76 --> 01:59:32.24
but then again, you wanna train on mats, right?

3350
01:59:32.24 --> 01:59:35.000
So why not always train on concrete?

3351
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.96
Well, because your knees would be jacked up,

3352
01:59:36.96 --> 01:59:39.88
you hurt your head, you're gonna break your elbow eventually,

3353
01:59:39.88 --> 01:59:42.60
but you wanna be aware of that.

3354
01:59:42.60 --> 01:59:45.08
One thing was one of Sergeant Knows him

3355
01:59:45.08 --> 01:59:46.68
and all the guys in Puerto Rico when I was there

3356
01:59:46.68 --> 01:59:49.28
for a few weeks after the hurricanes working.

3357
01:59:49.28 --> 01:59:51.28
We're just delivering water, that's all.

3358
01:59:52.32 --> 01:59:54.76
One guy, and you probably know him, I don't know his name,

3359
01:59:54.76 --> 01:59:58.24
but the story is the guy was an ex-tier one, whatever.

3360
01:59:58.24 --> 02:00:01.20
I don't know, I think a seal became a cop,

3361
02:00:01.20 --> 02:00:03.32
but he was ranked top 10 in the world with shooting,

3362
02:00:03.32 --> 02:00:05.36
but where your hands are here and you reach,

3363
02:00:05.36 --> 02:00:06.68
it's a quick draw.

3364
02:00:06.68 --> 02:00:08.20
The guy's ranked top 10 in the world,

3365
02:00:08.20 --> 02:00:10.20
it's a quick draw where your hands are above,

3366
02:00:10.20 --> 02:00:13.76
and then he got stuck up, he was off duty,

3367
02:00:13.76 --> 02:00:17.000
so I actually pulled a gun on him, he went like this.

3368
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.72
Because he's so trained to do that, he still won.

3369
02:00:19.72 --> 02:00:22.44
He drew on the draw, I mean, that's how fast this guy,

3370
02:00:22.44 --> 02:00:24.72
he's still, you're not supposed to draw,

3371
02:00:24.72 --> 02:00:27.80
someone's already considered dumb, this guy's too fast,

3372
02:00:27.80 --> 02:00:30.68
so he actually went from here and still survived

3373
02:00:30.68 --> 02:00:32.36
and the guy, I don't think he made it,

3374
02:00:32.36 --> 02:00:35.48
the guy with the loaded gun, trying to rob him.

3375
02:00:35.48 --> 02:00:37.88
But the thing is, that training of him being so fast

3376
02:00:37.88 --> 02:00:40.60
is good, but he didn't need to do this.

3377
02:00:40.60 --> 02:00:41.88
He's trained so much that you shoot from here,

3378
02:00:41.88 --> 02:00:43.84
he still won, but that's a wasted movement,

3379
02:00:43.84 --> 02:00:45.52
think about that, so he still won.

3380
02:00:45.52 --> 02:00:46.84
So that right there, that kind of training,

3381
02:00:46.84 --> 02:00:48.16
I think for a quick draw is good,

3382
02:00:48.16 --> 02:00:49.68
but then again, don't put your hands up here.

3383
02:00:49.68 --> 02:00:51.40
Maybe that actually played into the whole,

3384
02:00:51.40 --> 02:00:53.84
okay, he's compliant, maybe it's actually good,

3385
02:00:53.84 --> 02:00:56.44
but I'm saying, they were saying how he still survived

3386
02:00:56.44 --> 02:00:58.84
because he was trained, so that was just,

3387
02:00:58.84 --> 02:01:00.12
and you know the guy, I don't know his name,

3388
02:01:00.12 --> 02:01:01.68
but that was Sarge and all the guys in there,

3389
02:01:01.68 --> 02:01:04.40
like it's a tight community, so I think it's good

3390
02:01:04.40 --> 02:01:05.56
to try that middle ground.

3391
02:01:05.56 --> 02:01:06.40
We're looking for the middle ground,

3392
02:01:06.40 --> 02:01:07.40
you want to replicate things,

3393
02:01:07.40 --> 02:01:09.56
you want to be able to do it in a relatively safe environment,

3394
02:01:09.56 --> 02:01:12.36
but always be prepared for what is going to happen

3395
02:01:12.36 --> 02:01:13.68
potentially.

3396
02:01:13.68 --> 02:01:14.72
That's why I like what the arm is doing,

3397
02:01:14.72 --> 02:01:17.12
it's a guideline, there's some flexibility there,

3398
02:01:17.12 --> 02:01:19.20
I think, of course, the lake locks.

3399
02:01:19.20 --> 02:01:20.52
Did you know the story about the Russian?

3400
02:01:20.52 --> 02:01:22.92
You know, actually, the first time I learned

3401
02:01:22.92 --> 02:01:25.56
lake locks before, choke holds in a seminar,

3402
02:01:25.56 --> 02:01:28.40
it's on Nikolay Baturin, he was a Soviet champion,

3403
02:01:28.40 --> 02:01:31.88
Osombo, Oltatar was there, other Russians were teaching,

3404
02:01:31.88 --> 02:01:35.52
they were saying like, the reason they prefer lake walkies

3405
02:01:35.52 --> 02:01:39.28
because, you know, big in Russia, I'm with my wife,

3406
02:01:39.28 --> 02:01:41.68
she's very attractive, and they go to a bar,

3407
02:01:41.68 --> 02:01:44.04
strange man grabs her inappropriately,

3408
02:01:44.04 --> 02:01:45.64
I'm very upset, I break his arm,

3409
02:01:45.64 --> 02:01:47.28
now he goes, the vehicle gets Kalashnikov,

3410
02:01:47.28 --> 02:01:49.44
he comes back and dead, I'm like, bro,

3411
02:01:49.44 --> 02:01:51.56
I'm 18 or 12, man, I don't know, fuck.

3412
02:01:51.56 --> 02:01:54.44
But imagine the scenario, the guy grabs my girl

3413
02:01:54.44 --> 02:01:56.60
very inappropriately, I break his leg,

3414
02:01:56.60 --> 02:01:57.92
takes a long time to go to the vehicle,

3415
02:01:57.92 --> 02:01:58.92
I get Kalashnikov.

3416
02:01:58.92 --> 02:02:02.84
There's always some kind of use for it,

3417
02:02:02.84 --> 02:02:05.44
I'm like, it makes sense, you know what I'm saying?

3418
02:02:05.44 --> 02:02:07.64
I'm already with my wife at home sleeping in bed.

3419
02:02:07.64 --> 02:02:11.48
I was actually supposed to lake locks before chokes,

3420
02:02:11.48 --> 02:02:12.88
believe it or not, so yeah, it's all good to have

3421
02:02:12.88 --> 02:02:13.72
the open mind.

3422
02:02:13.72 --> 02:02:16.84
Well, but chokes are part of Osombo as well.

3423
02:02:16.84 --> 02:02:20.08
Combat Osombo, in USA, illegal because this is back

3424
02:02:20.08 --> 02:02:22.96
in Stevensville all days, they thought choke holds,

3425
02:02:22.96 --> 02:02:26.60
you die, you know, like, you know, so in sports Osombo,

3426
02:02:26.60 --> 02:02:29.56
I think combat Osombo is not illegal,

3427
02:02:29.56 --> 02:02:32.80
but back then it was, you can do straight arm lock,

3428
02:02:32.80 --> 02:02:34.64
not even, you can do Kimura Osombo.

3429
02:02:34.64 --> 02:02:36.48
Just straight arm lock and straight knee lock, right?

3430
02:02:36.48 --> 02:02:37.84
If you have an arm lock and I stand on my feet,

3431
02:02:37.84 --> 02:02:40.04
it's illegal submission now, restarting your feet.

3432
02:02:40.04 --> 02:02:42.24
So that's an escape from a submission,

3433
02:02:42.24 --> 02:02:43.96
just standing on your feet, if I stand on it,

3434
02:02:43.96 --> 02:02:45.60
I have nothing but my feet are the only thing

3435
02:02:45.60 --> 02:02:47.68
touching the ground, stop, all submissions are illegal.

3436
02:02:47.68 --> 02:02:49.84
So yeah, just different sport.

3437
02:02:49.84 --> 02:02:52.56
And at some point they probably had some reason for that.

3438
02:02:52.56 --> 02:02:55.32
Like, if I pick you up and now I could drop you

3439
02:02:55.32 --> 02:02:56.16
on your head.

3440
02:02:56.16 --> 02:02:58.52
Therefore it's not gonna work anymore.

3441
02:02:58.52 --> 02:03:00.80
When we actually know, you let that evolve

3442
02:03:00.80 --> 02:03:03.44
a little bit further and now I'm gonna,

3443
02:03:03.44 --> 02:03:05.28
when you start to pick me up, I'm gonna grab your ankle

3444
02:03:05.28 --> 02:03:06.60
and I'll hold you and keep you down.

3445
02:03:06.60 --> 02:03:09.36
So you need to let things evolve naturally.

3446
02:03:09.36 --> 02:03:11.08
Rules don't help that usually.

3447
02:03:11.08 --> 02:03:12.32
I agree, I agree.

3448
02:03:12.32 --> 02:03:15.44
Yeah, well, I won two times national champion Osombo

3449
02:03:15.44 --> 02:03:16.44
was like 19.

3450
02:03:16.44 --> 02:03:17.84
And the third time I was gonna get third,

3451
02:03:17.84 --> 02:03:20.28
I was gonna be three times, but then I got in the finals

3452
02:03:20.28 --> 02:03:22.28
and the guy, he went, mate, he stood up.

3453
02:03:22.28 --> 02:03:24.28
So it means he give up, he's a judo guy.

3454
02:03:24.28 --> 02:03:27.44
Got his arm, ah, mate, that's illegal submission.

3455
02:03:28.60 --> 02:03:29.72
And my feet were crossed around the neck.

3456
02:03:29.72 --> 02:03:31.64
They go, it was almost choker with minus one point.

3457
02:03:31.64 --> 02:03:33.48
So I got even one minus one to zero.

3458
02:03:33.48 --> 02:03:36.40
So I lost, so I took second place one year, unfortunately.

3459
02:03:36.40 --> 02:03:37.24
But that's okay.

3460
02:03:37.24 --> 02:03:39.36
So you're two time champ and then one time second.

3461
02:03:39.36 --> 02:03:40.76
Yeah, Sombos are tough sports, good.

3462
02:03:40.76 --> 02:03:41.60
I like Sombos.

3463
02:03:41.60 --> 02:03:42.44
Sombos awesome.

3464
02:03:42.44 --> 02:03:43.72
So Russian, martial arts, very good sport.

3465
02:03:43.72 --> 02:03:45.16
And the combat Sombos, really awesome too.

3466
02:03:45.16 --> 02:03:47.12
Yeah, MMA with the jacket.

3467
02:03:47.12 --> 02:03:48.72
MMA with the jacket.

3468
02:03:48.72 --> 02:03:49.56
Yeah.

3469
02:03:49.56 --> 02:03:50.68
I mean, look at Fedor.

3470
02:03:50.68 --> 02:03:51.52
Fedor.

3471
02:03:51.52 --> 02:03:54.72
Fedor was a Sombos champion.

3472
02:03:54.72 --> 02:03:55.64
Yeah, combat Sombos.

3473
02:03:55.64 --> 02:03:58.60
So was Khabib, you know, yeah, tough.

3474
02:03:58.60 --> 02:04:00.40
Would you say Khabib's more of a wrestler?

3475
02:04:00.40 --> 02:04:02.92
Yeah, yeah, but he's done judo Sombos.

3476
02:04:02.92 --> 02:04:04.80
But yeah, his style is very much,

3477
02:04:04.80 --> 02:04:06.72
he's very suited for Noi.

3478
02:04:06.72 --> 02:04:08.24
Just smashing people.

3479
02:04:08.24 --> 02:04:09.72
Smash. Smash, smash.

3480
02:04:09.72 --> 02:04:11.20
He's a tough guy, tough guy.

3481
02:04:11.20 --> 02:04:12.88
Oh, right on, awesome.

3482
02:04:12.88 --> 02:04:15.64
All right, well, appreciate everyone for listening.

3483
02:04:15.64 --> 02:04:16.48
Thank you.

3484
02:04:16.48 --> 02:04:17.32
Choco, can I mention something real fast?

3485
02:04:17.32 --> 02:04:18.16
Yeah, absolutely.

3486
02:04:18.16 --> 02:04:21.84
So everyone looking to August 789, Costa Rica,

Absolutely.

And go there and check that out.

3503
02:04:55.56 --> 02:04:57.20
I mean, that sounds like a rough deal,

3504
02:04:57.20 --> 02:04:59.64
going to Costa Rica and doing jujitsu.

3505
02:04:59.64 --> 02:05:00.48
How long is it?

3506
02:05:00.48 --> 02:05:02.28
It's three, it's four days.

3507
02:05:02.28 --> 02:05:03.12
Four days, yeah.

3508
02:05:03.12 --> 02:05:05.36
Ah, that sounds like a good time.

3509
02:05:05.36 --> 02:05:06.20
I know, I know.

3510
02:05:06.20 --> 02:05:07.04
When is it?

3511
02:05:07.04 --> 02:05:08.20
August 789.

3512
02:05:08.20 --> 02:05:11.20
So everyone rides the six, 789, and the tenth

3513
02:05:11.20 --> 02:05:12.32
is like a free day.

3514
02:05:12.32 --> 02:05:14.36
So it's like four days on there.

3515
02:05:14.36 --> 02:05:15.76
Awesome, yeah, check that out.

3516
02:05:15.76 --> 02:05:18.44
If you want to go learn some jujitsu from the Boogie Man.

3517
02:05:18.44 --> 02:05:19.28
The Boogie Man.

3518
02:05:19.28 --> 02:05:20.12
Yeah.

3519
02:05:20.12 --> 02:05:22.04
Ah, the Boogie Man, check it out.

3520
02:05:22.04 --> 02:05:23.04
Thanks for supporting the podcast.

3521
02:05:23.04 --> 02:05:25.32
Go to jocofuel.com.

3522
02:05:25.32 --> 02:05:28.32
If you want to get some of these drinks, by the way,

3523
02:05:28.32 --> 02:05:30.20
which are freaking good to go.

3524
02:05:30.20 --> 02:05:32.20
They taste delicious.

3525
02:05:32.20 --> 02:05:34.20
Used to be, couldn't say that.

3526
02:05:34.20 --> 02:05:35.28
Well, some of us could.

3527
02:05:35.28 --> 02:05:36.92
Well, you'd be like, oh, they taste good.

3528
02:05:36.92 --> 02:05:38.72
Now, different ball game.

3529
02:05:38.72 --> 02:05:42.80
Yeah, you're reformulated to perfection, I think.

3530
02:05:42.80 --> 02:05:46.04
Yeah, so get yourself some of that.

3531
02:05:46.04 --> 02:05:51.12
That's the energy drink thing.

3532
02:05:51.12 --> 02:05:53.40
The reason we made them, look, I was on deployment.

3533
02:05:53.40 --> 02:05:56.68
We used to drink other brands of energy drinks

3534
02:05:56.68 --> 02:05:57.80
that were filled with sugar.

3535
02:05:57.80 --> 02:05:58.80
You drink too many of those things?

3536
02:05:58.80 --> 02:05:59.28
Oh, yeah.

3537
02:05:59.28 --> 02:05:59.60
Yeah, you got like, uh.

3538
02:05:59.60 --> 02:06:00.16
For sure.

3539
02:06:00.16 --> 02:06:01.20
And you feel awful.

3540
02:06:01.20 --> 02:06:03.56
It's even worse, not worse than drinking, but I mean.

3541
02:06:03.56 --> 02:06:04.12
It's not.

3542
02:06:04.12 --> 02:06:05.08
It's horrible for me.

3543
02:06:05.08 --> 02:06:05.84
Yeah, it's bad.

3544
02:06:05.84 --> 02:06:07.48
And so that's what happened on deployment.

3545
02:06:07.48 --> 02:06:08.28
It would be like that.

3546
02:06:08.28 --> 02:06:12.08
And that's why when at Jocofuel, it was like, hey,

3547
02:06:12.08 --> 02:06:13.96
do you, Brian asked me, he's like,

3548
02:06:13.96 --> 02:06:15.08
do you want to do an energy drink?

3549
02:06:15.08 --> 02:06:17.32
And I was like, I would only want to do that

3550
02:06:17.32 --> 02:06:19.88
if it was possible to make them actually good for you.

3551
02:06:19.88 --> 02:06:20.52
Yeah.

3552
02:06:20.52 --> 02:06:22.44
And then he was like, let me come up with a formula.

3553
02:06:22.44 --> 02:06:23.76
Just start with your cranberry white tea.

3554
02:06:23.76 --> 02:06:24.40
Is that how it started?

3555
02:06:24.40 --> 02:06:25.28
Yeah, that's how it started.

3556
02:06:25.28 --> 02:06:26.16
Chug with his white cranberry.

3557
02:06:26.16 --> 02:06:26.80
Pomegranate.

3558
02:06:26.80 --> 02:06:27.44
Pomegranate.

3559
02:06:27.44 --> 02:06:28.88
Pomegranate white tea.

3560
02:06:28.88 --> 02:06:29.36
What'd you say?

3561
02:06:29.36 --> 02:06:29.86
Chai?

3562
02:06:29.86 --> 02:06:31.52
Is that what we're saying?

3563
02:06:31.52 --> 02:06:32.000
Cherry.

3564
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:32.76
White cherry.

3565
02:06:32.76 --> 02:06:33.60
You say cranberry.

3566
02:06:33.60 --> 02:06:34.08
OK.

3567
02:06:34.08 --> 02:06:35.08
I don't know.

3568
02:06:35.08 --> 02:06:36.08
Pomegranate.

3569
02:06:36.08 --> 02:06:37.08
That was way off.

3570
02:06:37.08 --> 02:06:38.68
Well, pomegranate's not as obvious.

3571
02:06:38.68 --> 02:06:39.08
OK, yeah, that's true.

3572
02:06:39.08 --> 02:06:42.32
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

3573
02:06:42.32 --> 02:06:43.40
Yeah, but there is a benefit.

3574
02:06:43.40 --> 02:06:45.20
There's times when you need energy.

3575
02:06:45.20 --> 02:06:45.70
Yeah.

3576
02:06:45.70 --> 02:06:46.80
So you might as well get it.

3577
02:06:46.80 --> 02:06:48.48
And you might as well not have a bunch of sugar in there

3578
02:06:48.48 --> 02:06:49.96
and have an overloaded caffeine that

3579
02:06:49.96 --> 02:06:52.08
makes you jittery and crazy.

3580
02:06:52.08 --> 02:06:55.08
Just get something that's smooth, good, clean energy

3581
02:06:55.08 --> 02:06:56.000
good for you.

3582
02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.48
That's a Jocoh Discipline Go, jocohuil.com.

3583
02:06:59.48 --> 02:07:00.36
You can get it at Wawa.

3584
02:07:00.36 --> 02:07:02.36
You can get it at Vitamin Shop.

3585
02:07:02.36 --> 02:07:04.32
You can get it at HEB down in Texas.

3586
02:07:04.32 --> 02:07:06.12
A bunch of, we're spreading.

3587
02:07:06.12 --> 02:07:07.36
I need to get a list.

3588
02:07:07.36 --> 02:07:10.000
I need to get a list of all the places you can get jocohuil.

3589
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.36
So there you go.

3590
02:07:11.36 --> 02:07:12.28
Gorge D. USA.

3591
02:07:12.28 --> 02:07:13.88
You have demand for it in Brazil now.

3592
02:07:13.88 --> 02:07:14.68
I know.

3593
02:07:14.68 --> 02:07:15.18
I know.

3594
02:07:15.18 --> 02:07:16.04
And Brazil.

3595
02:07:16.04 --> 02:07:18.12
We got it down in Australia too.

3596
02:07:18.12 --> 02:07:18.64
Oh, yeah.

3597
02:07:18.64 --> 02:07:21.24
There's, we have a distributor down in Australia.

3598
02:07:21.24 --> 02:07:23.68
So that's going forward.

3599
02:07:23.68 --> 02:07:27.56
So yeah, we're spreading because it's good.

3600
02:07:27.56 --> 02:07:29.32
The milk is good.

3601
02:07:29.32 --> 02:07:30.48
The joint warfare is good.

3602
02:07:30.48 --> 02:07:32.68
The super crills, so it's all good.

3603
02:07:32.68 --> 02:07:35.52
And that's what people kind of know now.

3604
02:07:35.52 --> 02:07:37.08
Like we're making the good stuff.

3605
02:07:37.08 --> 02:07:39.44
We're making the goods.

3606
02:07:39.44 --> 02:07:40.44
Get yourself some of that.

3607
02:07:40.44 --> 02:07:41.68
originusa.com.

3608
02:07:41.68 --> 02:07:42.92
Making geese.

3609
02:07:42.92 --> 02:07:43.96
Jujitsu geese.

3610
02:07:43.96 --> 02:07:46.32
You want to train that Jujitsu gi.

3611
02:07:46.32 --> 02:07:49.28
You want to train that Jujitsu gi because it's going to make

3612
02:07:49.28 --> 02:07:51.28
your all your game better.

3613
02:07:51.28 --> 02:07:52.08
Gee, no gi.

3614
02:07:52.08 --> 02:07:55.64
If you do gi, it's going to get better.

3615
02:07:55.64 --> 02:07:58.88
I think your defense gets better when you wear.

3616
02:07:58.88 --> 02:07:59.80
Because you're stuck more.

3617
02:07:59.80 --> 02:08:01.08
Because you're stuck more.

3618
02:08:01.08 --> 02:08:03.64
Your offense gets better when you don't have a gi on

3619
02:08:03.64 --> 02:08:06.28
because you have to do it really tight.

3620
02:08:06.28 --> 02:08:09.60
You have to keep advancing more with no gi because people

3621
02:08:09.60 --> 02:08:11.92
slip out easier.

3622
02:08:11.92 --> 02:08:14.12
You should get a gi that's made in America.

3623
02:08:14.12 --> 02:08:17.12
Not by slave labor, but made by hardworking Americans.

3624
02:08:17.12 --> 02:08:18.52
That's my recommendation.

3625
02:08:18.52 --> 02:08:19.88
originusa.com.

3626
02:08:19.88 --> 02:08:22.20
We've got some Hunt gear on the way.

3627
02:08:22.20 --> 02:08:23.40
Actually, what's today?

3628
02:08:23.40 --> 02:08:25.08
That should be hitting my.

3629
02:08:25.08 --> 02:08:27.76
I should be getting some, the first production stuff

3630
02:08:27.76 --> 02:08:28.92
coming soon.

3631
02:08:28.92 --> 02:08:31.24
Joco, can you make a gi that's just like sandpaper?

3632
02:08:31.24 --> 02:08:32.96
Like a sandpaper gi?

3633
02:08:32.96 --> 02:08:34.16
I want to get really good.

3634
02:08:34.16 --> 02:08:35.60
Really good at escaping submissions.

3635
02:08:35.60 --> 02:08:37.16
No.

3636
02:08:37.16 --> 02:08:38.16
Because you're not slipping on that.

3637
02:08:38.16 --> 02:08:40.96
The origin geese are so comfortable.

3638
02:08:40.96 --> 02:08:41.60
They're so good.

3639
02:08:41.60 --> 02:08:42.52
They're a different thing.

3640
02:08:42.52 --> 02:08:43.04
Spoiled.

3641
02:08:43.04 --> 02:08:44.28
We are spoiled now.

3642
02:08:44.28 --> 02:08:45.12
Yeah, they are spoiled.

3643
02:08:45.12 --> 02:08:47.08
My first Jiu-Jitsu geese were like,

3644
02:08:47.08 --> 02:08:47.72
Bloody.

3645
02:08:47.72 --> 02:08:48.92
Nasty.

3646
02:08:48.92 --> 02:08:49.44
Bloody.

3647
02:08:49.44 --> 02:08:51.40
Awful to wear.

3648
02:08:51.40 --> 02:08:52.56
So don't do that.

3649
02:08:52.56 --> 02:08:53.88
Go to originusa.com.

3650
02:08:53.88 --> 02:08:57.80
Get yourself some jeans, boots, Hunt gear, Jiu-Jitsu gear.

3651
02:08:57.80 --> 02:08:58.12
We got it.

3652
02:08:58.12 --> 02:08:58.80
We got you covered.

3653
02:08:58.80 --> 02:08:59.44
Made in America.

3654
02:08:59.44 --> 02:09:00.16
All of it.

3655
02:09:00.16 --> 02:09:00.96
It's true.

3656
02:09:00.96 --> 02:09:01.12
Good stuff.

3657
02:09:01.12 --> 02:09:02.12
To the bone.

3658
02:09:02.12 --> 02:09:04.68
Speaking of apparel, Joco is a store as well.

3659
02:09:04.68 --> 02:09:06.000
It's called Joco Store.

3660
02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.88
Dean Lister has his own shirt.

3661
02:09:07.88 --> 02:09:08.92
Yeah, yeah, we're going to have this.

3662
02:09:08.92 --> 02:09:09.84
Is it live?

3663
02:09:09.84 --> 02:09:11.64
It's been live.

3664
02:09:11.64 --> 02:09:12.76
Actually, we haven't really like.

3665
02:09:12.76 --> 02:09:14.28
This one that says foot yet.

3666
02:09:14.28 --> 02:09:17.64
OK, so it's a take off on the good shirt.

3667
02:09:17.64 --> 02:09:20.84
I showed up at the, people were like, what the?

3668
02:09:20.84 --> 02:09:24.84
It started off with the good shirt, which had my head on it.

3669
02:09:24.84 --> 02:09:28.96
And then the echo shirt, which said dang, which had your head

3670
02:09:28.96 --> 02:09:30.72
on it, which I designed.

3671
02:09:30.72 --> 02:09:32.12
And then who designed your shirt?

3672
02:09:32.12 --> 02:09:32.60
D.M.

3673
02:09:32.60 --> 02:09:34.40
I came up with just, I did it like in 20 minutes.

3674
02:09:34.40 --> 02:09:35.52
Just a joke.

3675
02:09:35.52 --> 02:09:36.80
I wore it to the park.

3676
02:09:36.80 --> 02:09:39.56
And he was like, oh, I would like it all.

3677
02:09:39.56 --> 02:09:43.48
So if you don't know, Dean Lister is notorious and famous

3678
02:09:43.48 --> 02:09:49.04
for changing the realm of jujitsu by attacking the feet

3679
02:09:49.04 --> 02:09:51.12
and the legs and the knees.

3680
02:09:51.12 --> 02:09:52.96
And so he made a shirt with his head on it.

3681
02:09:52.96 --> 02:09:54.88
We made a shirt with his head on it.

3682
02:09:54.88 --> 02:09:58.000
And instead of saying good, this is foot.

3683
02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:58.64
Same style.

3684
02:09:58.64 --> 02:10:02.52
It actually came out really, really good.

3685
02:10:02.52 --> 02:10:04.12
Also, yeah, some new stuff on there.

3686
02:10:04.12 --> 02:10:05.32
Discipline equals freedom.

3687
02:10:05.32 --> 02:10:06.32
Standard issue.

3688
02:10:06.32 --> 02:10:07.28
Standard issue.

3689
02:10:07.28 --> 02:10:08.80
Many color ways.

3690
02:10:08.80 --> 02:10:10.20
Look at you with the big words.

3691
02:10:10.20 --> 02:10:12.36
You talk to me like I'm talking to Pete Roberts over here,

3692
02:10:12.36 --> 02:10:15.12
talking about color ways and whatnot.

3693
02:10:15.12 --> 02:10:15.92
Hey, you taught me it.

3694
02:10:15.92 --> 02:10:16.76
So yeah, I'm going to roll it.

3695
02:10:16.76 --> 02:10:17.92
Did I actually teach you that?

3696
02:10:17.92 --> 02:10:19.04
You knew that.

3697
02:10:19.04 --> 02:10:21.56
It sounded familiar, but you're the one who said color ways

3698
02:10:21.56 --> 02:10:22.28
and explained it.

3699
02:10:22.28 --> 02:10:24.08
I was like, OK.

3700
02:10:24.08 --> 02:10:26.56
I might have heard it before, but I've never used it

3701
02:10:26.56 --> 02:10:27.44
till just now.

3702
02:10:27.44 --> 02:10:27.68
Thanks.

3703
02:10:27.68 --> 02:10:30.56
That's really dipping your toes into the fashion industry

3704
02:10:30.56 --> 02:10:32.52
when you start saying color ways.

3705
02:10:32.52 --> 02:10:37.04
But color ways I think can be used to describe like cars

3706
02:10:37.04 --> 02:10:39.72
or like anything.

3707
02:10:39.72 --> 02:10:40.88
Like the scheme.

3708
02:10:40.88 --> 02:10:42.84
Anything that could be made in multiple colors.

3709
02:10:42.84 --> 02:10:48.28
I believe in the industry, they use the term color ways.

3710
02:10:48.28 --> 02:10:49.20
Like sneakers.

3711
02:10:49.20 --> 02:10:50.24
Sneakers.

3712
02:10:50.24 --> 02:10:52.52
I think that's how I know it from sneakers.

3713
02:10:52.52 --> 02:10:55.48
Someone's talking about a sneaker professional who was like,

3714
02:10:55.48 --> 02:10:57.80
yeah, we got to offer these different color ways.

3715
02:10:57.80 --> 02:10:58.68
And I said, OK.

3716
02:10:58.68 --> 02:11:00.000
Little combos of colors.

3717
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:00.60
There you go.

3718
02:11:00.60 --> 02:11:01.32
Yeah.

3719
02:11:01.32 --> 02:11:01.84
Well, there you go.

3720
02:11:01.84 --> 02:11:02.64
We got color ways.

3721
02:11:02.64 --> 02:11:03.48
But anyway, yes.

3722
02:11:03.48 --> 02:11:04.64
Call it the standard issue.

3723
02:11:04.64 --> 02:11:05.72
Discipline equals freedom.

3724
02:11:05.72 --> 02:11:06.40
Shirt.

3725
02:11:06.40 --> 02:11:06.76
It's good.

3726
02:11:06.76 --> 02:11:08.36
It's new.

3727
02:11:08.36 --> 02:11:09.28
I didn't blow it up yet.

3728
02:11:09.28 --> 02:11:09.96
But you know.

3729
02:11:09.96 --> 02:11:10.44
All right.

3730
02:11:10.44 --> 02:11:11.44
So you can check that out.

3731
02:11:11.44 --> 02:11:12.72
Also, we got the shirt locker, which

3732
02:11:12.72 --> 02:11:14.04
is a subscription situation.

3733
02:11:14.04 --> 02:11:15.96
If you didn't know, new designs.

3734
02:11:15.96 --> 02:11:18.32
Every month you get a new shirt, a new design.

3735
02:11:18.32 --> 02:11:20.20
A little bit more creative.

3736
02:11:20.20 --> 02:11:21.92
That's what I'm not at right now.

3737
02:11:21.92 --> 02:11:23.000
You haven't advanced.

3738
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.24
You haven't gotten very creative on your creative description

3739
02:11:25.24 --> 02:11:26.32
to be creative yet.

3740
02:11:26.32 --> 02:11:26.68
You know why?

3741
02:11:26.68 --> 02:11:28.52
Because all the creativity goes into the designs.

3742
02:11:28.52 --> 02:11:29.04
You see what I'm saying?

3743
02:11:29.04 --> 02:11:30.68
Not the descriptions of the designs.

3744
02:11:30.68 --> 02:11:32.96
They'd be like a meta description.

3745
02:11:32.96 --> 02:11:34.88
Either way, they're good.

3746
02:11:34.88 --> 02:11:35.84
Great feedback on that one.

3747
02:11:35.84 --> 02:11:39.36
So check that out at jockelstore.com.

October 12th through the 14th, the muster.

3770
02:12:22.24 --> 02:12:23.04
It's going to sell out.

3771
02:12:23.04 --> 02:12:24.40
They all do.

3772
02:12:24.40 --> 02:12:25.72
So we'll see you there.

3773
02:12:25.72 --> 02:12:27.92
Also, we have an online training academy.

3774
02:12:27.92 --> 02:12:28.68
Just like Jiu Jitsu.

3775
02:12:28.68 --> 02:12:33.76
You're not going to get good at fighting in one day or one

3776
02:12:33.76 --> 02:12:34.04
week.

3777
02:12:34.04 --> 02:12:35.28
You've got to do it all the time.

3778
02:12:35.28 --> 02:12:37.88
That's why we made the Academy Extreme Ownership Academy,

3779
02:12:37.88 --> 02:12:39.44

She's got a charity organization.

It does outstanding work supporting our warriors.

3787
02:12:57.36 --> 02:12:58.72
Yep.

3788
02:12:58.72 --> 02:13:01.68

He's got heroesandhorses.org.

3793
02:13:09.40 --> 02:13:12.20
Just got out of the field, I think, today.

3794
02:13:12.20 --> 02:13:14.64
A bunch of dudes been out in the field for 41 days,

3795
02:13:14.64 --> 02:13:18.52
riding horses, sitting in cold water, eating raw meat.

3796
02:13:18.52 --> 02:13:21.84
Just getting back, back to it.

3797
02:13:21.84 --> 02:13:23.92

He's at Dean Lister, BJJ.

3801
02:13:31.96 --> 02:13:32.56
That's right.

3802
02:13:32.56 --> 02:13:35.84
I cannot be held accountable for some of the things

3803
02:13:35.84 --> 02:13:38.32
that he posts.

3804
02:13:38.32 --> 02:13:39.88
I'd like to cross some drama.

3805
02:13:39.88 --> 02:13:42.28
You go to some dark places in weird times.

3806
02:13:42.28 --> 02:13:44.64
So if you wake up in the morning and there's

3807
02:13:44.64 --> 02:13:47.08
posts from Dean Lister at 3 o'clock in the morning,

3808
02:13:47.08 --> 02:13:49.40
hey, what's that?

3809
02:13:49.40 --> 02:13:50.76
Be advised, right?

3810
02:13:50.76 --> 02:13:52.16
Be advised.

3811
02:13:52.16 --> 02:13:52.76
It's random.

3812
02:13:52.76 --> 02:13:54.40
You might be offended.

3813
02:13:54.40 --> 02:13:55.56
You might be disgusted.

3814
02:13:55.56 --> 02:13:56.80
Very possible, yeah.

3815
02:13:56.80 --> 02:13:58.36
Man, he sent me one the other day.

3816
02:13:58.36 --> 02:13:59.92
Was that a post from Instagram?

3817
02:13:59.92 --> 02:14:01.36
The guy getting cut in the neck?

3818
02:14:01.36 --> 02:14:03.08
Oh, that was sent to me.

3819
02:14:03.08 --> 02:14:08.48
Yeah, I mean, it was like a horrible scene of a guy.

3820
02:14:08.48 --> 02:14:11.40
It looks like your typical couple drunk dude,

3821
02:14:11.40 --> 02:14:13.68
like three or four drunk guys, going

3822
02:14:13.68 --> 02:14:15.64
to fight another three or four drunk guys,

3823
02:14:15.64 --> 02:14:17.72
and they're talking smack to each other.

3824
02:14:17.72 --> 02:14:20.84
And then one of the guys pulls out a knife in that way,

3825
02:14:20.84 --> 02:14:22.04
like, oh, I've got a knife out.

3826
02:14:22.04 --> 02:14:23.08
I better back off.

3827
02:14:23.08 --> 02:14:24.44
And the other guy's sort of like, well,

3828
02:14:24.44 --> 02:14:25.72
you wouldn't do anything anyways.

3829
02:14:25.72 --> 02:14:27.76
And it just sort of seems like this kind of innocent.

3830
02:14:27.76 --> 02:14:28.60
It's crazy.

3831
02:14:28.60 --> 02:14:30.84
I mean, as innocent as it could be pulling out a knife,

3832
02:14:30.84 --> 02:14:31.92
it was that innocent.

3833
02:14:31.92 --> 02:14:33.28
That's all it is.

3834
02:14:33.28 --> 02:14:36.32
I'm saying, it didn't look like the intent was

3835
02:14:36.32 --> 02:14:38.40
we're about to murder somebody.

3836
02:14:38.40 --> 02:14:40.68
And the one dude that doesn't have a knife

3837
02:14:40.68 --> 02:14:42.000
comes kind of like walking over like, oh,

3838
02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:42.92
what are you going to do?

3839
02:14:42.92 --> 02:14:43.16
Cut me?

3840
02:14:43.16 --> 02:14:44.72
With that kind of look on his face,

3841
02:14:44.72 --> 02:14:46.72
but not expecting anything to happen?

3842
02:14:46.72 --> 02:14:50.32
And in a millisecond, in a millisecond,

3843
02:14:50.32 --> 02:14:53.56
the dude like swings at him with the knife and cuts his throat.

3844
02:14:53.56 --> 02:14:55.72
And the dude is dead in 10 seconds.

3845
02:14:55.72 --> 02:14:59.08
He passes out in five seconds, and he's probably dead another.

3846
02:14:59.08 --> 02:15:03.48
So another reason, don't get in street fights.

3847
02:15:03.48 --> 02:15:04.52
Don't get in street fights.

3848
02:15:04.52 --> 02:15:05.52
They're stupid.

3849
02:15:05.52 --> 02:15:06.48
You get stabbed in the neck.

3850
02:15:06.48 --> 02:15:08.28
You could break your hand, whatever.

3851
02:15:08.28 --> 02:15:10.000
Anything in between.

3852
02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.56
So don't do that.

3853
02:15:11.56 --> 02:15:13.72
But if you want to check out Dean Lister on Instagram,

3854
02:15:13.72 --> 02:15:16.92
there he is, Dean Lister, BJJ.

3855
02:15:16.92 --> 02:15:18.96
On the Twitter, on the gram, on Facebook,

3856
02:15:18.96 --> 02:15:20.28
I'm on there as well.

3857
02:15:20.28 --> 02:15:20.84
Echo's on there.

3858
02:15:20.84 --> 02:15:21.60
Echo's at Echo Charles.

3859
02:15:21.60 --> 02:15:22.40
I'm at Jocko-Willink.

3860
02:15:22.40 --> 02:15:24.52
Watch out for the algorithm, by the way.

3861
02:15:24.52 --> 02:15:25.76
Because I think I'm going to grab you.

3862
02:15:25.76 --> 02:15:28.16
It's going to waste an hour of your day.

3863
02:15:28.16 --> 02:15:29.68
You're going to take an hour from you.

3864
02:15:29.68 --> 02:15:30.48
Imagine that.

3865
02:15:30.48 --> 02:15:33.24
A monster that came in every day and took an hour from you.

3866
02:15:33.24 --> 02:15:34.20
Or two hours from you.

3867
02:15:34.20 --> 02:15:35.56
Can't get it back.

3868
02:15:35.56 --> 02:15:38.20
That's the algorithm monster that's going to get you.

3869
02:15:38.20 --> 02:15:40.24
So that's it.

3870
02:15:40.24 --> 02:15:43.20
Thanks to all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines

3871
02:15:43.20 --> 02:15:46.36
who continue to find ways to fight better in every respect.

3872
02:15:46.36 --> 02:15:49.16
Thanks again to Matt Larson for driving this initiative

3873
02:15:49.16 --> 02:15:49.56
in the Army.

3874
02:15:49.56 --> 02:15:50.60
I know there's, like I said, I know.

3875
02:15:50.60 --> 02:15:52.80
I'm sure there's a bunch of other people that helped out.

3876
02:15:52.80 --> 02:15:54.40
I know that he was leading the charge.

3877
02:15:54.40 --> 02:15:56.52
So salute to him.

3878
02:15:56.52 --> 02:15:59.48
And the rest of the military personnel

3879
02:15:59.48 --> 02:16:01.60
that are out there putting these skills to the test

3880
02:16:01.60 --> 02:16:03.68
on the battlefields, thanks for what you do.

3881
02:16:03.68 --> 02:16:07.36
Also, thanks to police and law enforcement.

3882
02:16:07.36 --> 02:16:10.48
Do what you can to get out there and train.

3883
02:16:10.48 --> 02:16:11.92
You need it.

3884
02:16:11.92 --> 02:16:13.96
We need it.

3885
02:16:13.96 --> 02:16:16.64
Also, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

3886
02:16:16.64 --> 02:16:18.84
correctional officers, border patrol, secret service.

3887
02:16:18.84 --> 02:16:20.84
All the first responders, thank you

3888
02:16:20.84 --> 02:16:24.52
for keeping us safe here in our own country.

3889
02:16:24.52 --> 02:16:29.12
And everyone out there, go train.

3890
02:16:29.12 --> 02:16:30.16
Train whatever you can.

3891
02:16:30.16 --> 02:16:34.16
Train wrestling, train boxing, jujitsu, moitai, train judo,

3892
02:16:34.16 --> 02:16:38.24
and sombo, and train with guns and knives and bow and arrow.

3893
02:16:38.24 --> 02:16:41.92
And test and learn and adjust and get better.

3894
02:16:41.92 --> 02:16:45.48
And it will make you better in every aspect of life.

3895
02:16:45.48 --> 02:16:49.48
Just go train.

3896
02:16:49.48 --> 02:16:54.12
And until next time, this is Dean and Echo and Jaco.

3897
02:16:54.12 --> 02:17:14.64
Thanks again.
