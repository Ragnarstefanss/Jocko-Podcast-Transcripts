00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel podcast number 231 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Also joining us tonight. Once again, is Dave Burke, good evening, Dave. Good evening.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So last podcast was with Dan Peterson. If you haven't listened to that, he was the first officer in charge of the top gun weapons school in the Navy.

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's a great podcast. It was awesome to have him on there.

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And as I heard him talking the entire time as I read his book, which is also called Top Gun, an American story, the thing about Top Gun is that it's not just a school for fighter jet pilots to go to.

6
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There is a fought pattern. There is a mentality. There is an attitude. And this is not the attitude of, you know, that, and it really, you know,

7
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we barely even talked about the movie Top Gun on the podcast with him.

8
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And that's because in my mind, I could barely connect the two. I could barely connect the reality of that original Top Gun school with the attitudes.

9
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You look, there's some on the Venn diagram. There's some, there's some overlap, of course.

10
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But we're not talking about the arrogant jetjockey. We're talking about the attitude of trying to improve, trying to learn and trying to win.

11
00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And there is a giant overlap. The biggest overlap that I found, the largest overlap in the Venn diagrams in my brain is, well, it's, it's my kind of fundamental core fought pattern, which is extreme ownership.

12
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:26.000
That's what it boils down to is this attitude that when you lose a dogfight, and this was very interesting when you lose a dogfight, you don't blame the plane, you don't blame the other pilot, you blame yourself, you say, okay, this is my fault. Why did I lose?

13
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And how can I win? And I, that's something that has possessed my life, and I see all kinds of comparison in there. And I see the same, look, that same mentality, that ownership mentality.

14
00:02:42.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's in good seals. It's in, it's in a good jiu-jitsu school. It's in a good business. It's in a good team, and it's in good leaders. And as, as it relates to the seal teams, part of this is when we started using Simunition and we'll get into it. When we started using paintball, whatever you want to call it,

15
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Simunition slash paintball, laser attack, this multi-million dollar laser tax system that we have, when you add that in here, and you can start dogfighting.

16
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
You figure out if you're smart, if you take ownership, you figure out how to win.

17
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You see, jiu-jitsu. Look, no one really knew who is going to win a fight between a karate guy and a wrestler or a, or a Kenbo guy and a jiu-jitsu guy. No one really knew who is going to win until the UFC until people started fighting or whatever valley to do and because whatever you, whatever you want to go,

18
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
when people start to go at it, when people, when you actually engage in combat and then you ask yourself, why did I lose?

19
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Why did I lose? And when you ask yourself why you lost and you don't blame it on the guy was bit think of how easy that would be in jiu-jitsu. Hey, the guy was bigger than me, the guy was stronger than me, the guy was faster than me. Those are the reasons why my system didn't work.

20
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It's this excuse, it's that excuse, it's another excuse instead of saying, you know what? I didn't win.

21
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Let's figure out why I didn't win and then let's make some adaptations.

22
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And so the more I thought about this and I said it, you know, as soon as he left, as soon as Dan left, I was like, oh, we're going to have to go deep on this stuff day because the better, you know, the better I can understand what it looked like from your perspective, I think it just opens up a better understanding of this whole mentality.

23
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So let's talk, um, top gun and let's talk fighter tactics and let's talk winning and owning and making mistakes and learning from mistakes. Like this is how this is what the winning teams do.

24
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:25.000
There was some really interesting points when he was talking about boyd and he's saying boyd is saying this aircraft beats that aircraft, which if you think about it, just like we talk about with extreme ownership, if if I say, oh, that aircraft is faster, tighter turn or whatever, then mine, that it's not my fault that I lost.

25
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I was saying, hmm, what can I do to win? How can I win? And to me, that right there, that's the difference, that's the top gun attitude, that's the extreme ownership attitude, it's not my planes fault.

26
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's my fault and by the way, if you deliver me a plane, a military industry, if you deliver me a plane that doesn't function correctly, what do I need to do? Take ownership of that and say, let me give you guys some feedback.

27
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Here's where this fails, here's where this doesn't work, here's where the shortfalls are. If you don't have that attitude, you go up, you know what, we don't have a good enough plane, oh well, they didn't, they didn't get it right, oh well, we're going to lose now, oh well, that's the attitude of blaming others and you never get better.

28
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Yeah, I could talk all day, so this is a cool subject for me, I mean, just first things first with the the mentality of top gun is, I learned more humility at top gunners in the sugar than anywhere else. That's where I really started to learn humility, which is somewhat if you think about it from the outside counterintuitive.

29
00:06:42.000 --> 00:07:10.000
It's also connected to what you talked about with the movie, is the closer you get to top gun, the farther you get away from the movie and to the point that there's literally zero connection, because of course it's a movie, but when you're kid you see it and sort of represents some idyllic thing that looks really cool and it puts you on a path, we want to go do that and then more you learn about it, the more you realize it's just a movie top gun breeds more humility because of what is going on at top gun.

30
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The charter for top gun is even more daunting than the charter for being in a fighter squadron, so when you're in a fighter squadron you're supposed to be ready to go to war, you're in a operational fleet squadron, it's probably no different than being in a team, your job is ready to go to war.

31
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The charter for top gun is to train every single fighter squadron's leaders to lead their most junior pilots into combat, and that's a big, big deal. So when you talk about am I doing this right or doing this wrong, it isn't just how good am I, or it isn't even really just how good the people around me are.

32
00:07:44.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Is if what I'm doing impacts the entire, the entire friendly US and allied air forces across the entire globe, and that's a huge charter and that generates a lot of humility because you recognize what is you're doing, and it's really hard to understand that until you're on the inside.

33
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
When I got on the inside of top gun I realized what it really meant to be an instructor, you have a lot of weight in your shoulders and you have to deliver.

34
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I feel the same attitude of being the people that were responsible for preserving the capability of aerial combat.

35
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Did you feel that was there was there a sense that hey this is on me.

36
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000
You are part of a legacy and you are one of the people in the line that's currently working in that line and you have three years that's what you're going to get.

37
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000
The obligation that you feel to preserve the legacy and then make it better, which is also pretty daunting because you look back in the history of talking to the man.

38
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:59.000
How am I going to contribute to this and not just sustain it, but actually improve it. You feel that from day one there is a lot of history there and it's not just history to feel good about it, it's history just give you a sense of what you were part of and what they expect from you.

39
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It's also I've never worked so hard, I've never put in so many hours and I've never been more solely focused on one thing than I did in those three years.

40
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Even in the fleet, there was a little bit of a balance when I was at Top Gun the balance was skewed so far towards and I'll just say work just to be to make it simple, but the balance was so far skewed towards Top Gun that I honestly didn't do.

41
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I don't think I ever did anything from Monday morning at five o'clock in the morning till Friday night it probably 6.37 o'clock on Friday night.

42
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Those are the short days Friday afternoon is a short day. Everything I did was completely connected to work, everything.

43
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Imagine when you compare that to being out in the fleet, out in the fleet you got other things going on, right? You got manpower, you got administrative things that are happening, you got whatever deployment cycle and schedule and all this other kind of administrative stuff that just is totally gone on your Top Gun.

44
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The fleet is cyclical, so you have a work up phase and you have focus on this work up and you have deployment phase and that's a huge amount of focus and you come back and you kind of have, you know, a little bit of a let down phase, you lose some people they go well, so where you get some new people on board and it cycles and the pace cycles up and down, the responsibility cycle up and down, what you're trying to do changes all the time.

45
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Top Gun is a bullet train, it has been since 1969, you get on that train and there's no cycles, there's no downtime, there's no post deployment, none of those things happen. So you are just on that train all the time and that train is just moving and it never really slows down where when you're in a fleet squadron, I did my first four years in a fleet squadron.

46
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:47.000
It cycles all the time depending on what you're doing and that the cycles don't exist at Top Gun. So when you went to Top Gun for the first time as a student, how long had you been flying in F-184?

47
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I started flying F-18s, if I can get this right in early 1998, and I got to Top Gun in 2001.

48
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So you were kind of a new me. I was on the the younger side in both time and flight time, so time and time and fine total time and then time in an airplane. So I was a more junior guy.

49
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
There are certain qualifications you have to get and one of them is called a division, which is leading four airplanes or more.

50
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
That's a requirement to be there. I got that call, I think like the week before I showed up to Top Gun.

51
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So I was really junior to be going, you know, not unprecedented, but I was much more on the junior side and more on the inexperienced side when I got selected to go to the course.

52
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And how did you get the nod and not someone else?

53
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I mean, some of it's a bit of a numbers game. Every fleet squadron roughly has about 18 pilots and it varies, but the math is typically one person a year is going to go.

54
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So in your three years that you're in a squadron, you know, maybe four, three or four guys are going to go. Now sometimes you get two and one year and none the next because you're deployed, but it kind of works out to one a year.

55
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:10.000
But there's also a, you know, kind of a window of where you can go and I probably was competing with maybe 10 guys. It was not all 18, no, some of the squadron commander, some of the guys are, they're not really in the window to go.

56
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:25.000
So over those 10, you know, peers that you have, you're going to probably see one or two of those in your peer group go during your time in the fleet. And it's based on, you know, your performance, it's based on how well you've done up to that point. There's a bunch of qualifications you got.

57
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
What you doing one deployment at that point, I don't want to implement it.

58
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And they log every landing that you do in the career and it's all graded everything. And so you had whatever a bunch of tens and some nines and some other guy had a bunch of tens, but had an eight and they added all up.

59
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
There's a little more subjectivity to it.

60
00:12:44.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And the biggest event is, there's big culminating event in the fleet and the Navy and the Marine Corps do a very similar similarly is when you get what's called an ACT air combat tactics instructor quality. It's like the big work up to kind of fully qualify you as a combat flight lead.

61
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And it's a huge process and it culminates with this kind of weak, long evaluation where an instructor from the weapon school comes out and you fly with this person for a whole week and it puts you through from beginning to end. You put to the whole thing at the end.

62
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:26.000
He kind of determines if you're a qual and then he goes to your squadron commander and basically says, this is how this kid did compared to the dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens that I've done personally as an instructor and the hundreds and hundreds that we've done as a weapon school.

63
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And I want to tell the squadron commander where they think you are in their experience.

64
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And the feedback that my ACT instructor gave my squadron commander was enough for my squadron commander to look at all the other things he had and then get this external feedback to say, how I'm going to send Dave to Topga.

65
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Do you guys dog fight in like your regular squadron? Yes. You're going against each other. Yes.

66
00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And how many guys in the regular squadron have been to Topga and before? I think when I was there the first time there were two patchwares in my squadron. So if 18 guys I think two had were top congratulations.

67
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I think you can kick everyone's ass pretty much. Yep, they're pretty much.

68
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So you get the nod you go when you when you show up there, do you have any inkling in your head that you're going to do well that you're going to be able to hang you're just like you took no 100% that you're getting in with the black and with the sharks and with the black belts.

69
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So I don't have a feeling that I'm not going to succeed, but I have to be totally honest. I don't have a sense that I'm going to go that I'm going to dominate. I don't walk in there and day one thinking I'm going to crush this place. I wasn't afraid of failing.

70
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And you know, I've had that feeling in different places. I remember going to OCS the first time thinking, oh man, I might be in over my head here, but I had no sense of how long and OCS.

71
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Probably a week took me about a week to figure it out at OCS. First week was just kind of a state of paranoia like I'm not supposed to be here. I think I made a mistake. I'm in over my head.

72
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Did you not know what you were getting into?

73
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
I didn't. I did kind of sort of, but I didn't quite get it until I got there.

74
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
All the things leading up to OCS were just a whole bunch of administrative things they get you there.

75
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Like paperwork and interviews and applications and GPA and all. Just a bunch of stuff. All this is on.

76
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000
You know, you have to run physical fitness tests and show that you're qualified, but nobody ever, I never replicated that experience at all.

77
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Can we meet another loss of freedom of any kind?

78
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Can we meet another loss of freedom? And then what kind of shocked me for me at OCS and it was a little bit of a detour.

79
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
When I got to OCS, I looked around and everybody looked the way they looked. They all would bigger and stronger than me.

80
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And the kind of me and we think like, oh man, I'm supposed to look and be, I'm supposed to be six foot one and two and a half pounds.

81
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
That's what I'm supposed to look like. And I didn't. I was 18 and OCS. I mean, I was small.

82
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And I kind of told myself that what I was on paper wasn't who I was in real life.

83
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I'd never really been tested. I'd never been put in a situation. I didn't think I could handle.

84
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And I get to OCS and 36 hours after you get there, you're on the first platoon run.

85
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And I'm like, I can't run this fast. I've never run this fast in my life. How is everybody running this fast?

86
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
I remember looking around thinking, this is nuts.

87
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
I had enough fortitude in my mind to not quit.

88
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And the thing that helped me the most about OCS is the first time somebody else quit.

89
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And the first time I saw somebody else quit when I got over the how weird it looked to see somebody quit

90
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
That I see was a little, little, feel for little help for me.

91
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And the first week, people are quitting left and right. And every one of those times was helped me.

92
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Go hang on a second. I can do this until I got to point my, this is no factor.

93
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And the latter half of OCS was almost fun. I'm not going to say fun, but he got pretty close.

94
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And by the end of OCS, I thought I was 10 feet tall. But I, that was the only real time of my life that I went somewhere in the Marine Corps.

95
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I don't think I, I might have made a mistake here. And I proved, I, you know, it was a good test for me.

96
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So I didn't feel like that at top gun. I didn't feel like I was in over my head.

97
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But I felt like I was in a big, big, big ocean. And I was a pretty small fish. And I went to have to work really hard to get by.

98
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So how long is the top gun school? 10 weeks, a little bit over 10 weeks, but it's basically a 10 week school.

99
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Okay. So how many flights are you doing today?

100
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000
In the beginning, you kind of plan on to. And then about after the first third of the program, it's typically typically one a day.

101
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:41.000
One flight is an hour, hour and a half. Flight themselves are about an hour. One one point one is what you're going to log for flight time for at top.

102
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000
One flight a day for five weeks. First, first, first couple of weeks. You said it's two flights a day.

103
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Yeah. So it first week is academics. Then you do about two weeks of kind of two a day. Then you got another academic kind of thing in there.

104
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And then you're typically for the last half of one flight a day. How many air combat do you get in an hour?

105
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
So when you're fighting one against one, you're going to get probably four sets we call a set is one engagement.

106
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000
I'm going to start to finish. You can get four sometimes five. And then depending on how to go, maybe three or four is about right.

107
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Okay. When you start off, you just said one on one. That's where you start is one on one.

108
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Yeah. Me against you. That's where it starts. That's right. And I would think that because then the next thing you do is two against one, right?

109
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Yep.

110
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Is that right? That's right.

111
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
To who's the other, who's the other?

112
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
There's one bad guy and there's two good guys. The other good guy is a top gun pilot.

113
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Correct.

114
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:52.000
That's right. A student. Yeah. So when you go out to against one, it's you with an instructor. Oh, against an adversary.

115
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
God. Also in instructor. Okay.

116
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Yeah. Most of the fights you do up until the end, really heavy, heavy, heavy.

117
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
The one against one and the two against one is you are by yourself or you are with an instructor as your wingman.

118
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Okay. Well, that's the I assumed it would be you and me as students against echo the instructor.

119
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And we would go out there and beat him up.

120
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
There are a couple of fights like that. But most of the fights your wingman is your IP, your instructor.

121
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And that's because if it was two knuckleheads out there, we just wouldn't, we just wouldn't get anything right?

122
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:35.000
It's not the wouldn't get anything right. It's that the closer the instructor is to what you're doing, the more he can help evaluate your performance and give you the feedback that you need.

123
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Okay. So you go out.

124
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Let's say I go out. I'm the student, you're the instructor. We go out. We dog fight against echo. We do three dog fights, four dog fights. It takes an hour.

125
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000
We come back and look. I've heard you talk about these freaking debriefs, right?

126
00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:01.000
What, what are you telling me as my instructor in these debriefs? What are you telling me?

127
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And how are you telling me the things that I'm doing wrong? Is it just cold blooded because look, we all know that you know more than me.

128
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And I just fully accept it and I'm like all years. Is that pretty much where people are at?

129
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Yeah, for the most part.

130
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Look, I mean, I do not want to understate that there are ego. The ego's out there. And it's a top gun. It's there as a student.

131
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000
The ego is usually connected to kind of the fear of being exposed as not as good as you are as opposed to the ego of I think I'm better than you.

132
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And so the ego reveals itself in different ways. But for the most part, most people get there pretty early on.

133
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And the disparity between the students and instructors is so great that people aren't really that afraid to just be brutally honest.

134
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Now, people aren't jerks about it, but they are brutally honest. And you figure out very early as a student.

135
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And two things you figure out is it's in your best interest to identify all of your own mistakes and your instructors mistakes.

136
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
You know, if you can identify those two, because it reveals that you actually know what's going on.

137
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
The other side of is if you don't, the instructors pretty much don't miss anything.

138
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000
So if you have a thought like, man, this is really minor. I'm just going to kind of not talk about this.

139
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
It's going to get brought up. And it's always better for you to bring up your errors than have somebody else bring them up for you.

140
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And that gets, that gets in your head pretty quick.

141
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
So when we get back from this thing, I'm going to go through the debrief first. I get to kick it off because I'm the student.

142
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And I go, hey, I turned to tight there. I didn't use enough gas there. I didn't know what I was for a second over here.

143
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
I lost track of you. My wingman here.

144
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000
So this is the same thing at when I was running trade at, we would let the platoon's debrief first.

145
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Like, okay, guys, you tell us how it went. And usually the platoon chief will kick it off. And he's going to hit a lot of stuff.

146
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
The good ones will. The bad ones same thing that we either covered up or even worse.

147
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
They don't even know what just happened. They don't even know what mistakes got made.

148
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And, you know, so the platoon chief goes, then maybe the platoon lieutenant goes.

149
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
And he doesn't see as much usually as the chief, but then the the task unit senior chief might go.

150
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And he's going to see more. And then the task unit commander, you should get pretty close.

151
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And my goal every single when I was going through training with my task unit, my goal was like the instructor cadre will be silent.

152
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Because there will be nothing. We are going to rip ourselves apart. So hard that the instructor cadre is going to go.

153
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Actually, guys, it wasn't that bad.

154
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Yeah, that was always my goal. So that's where we're going.

155
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Yeah. And are you having to teach me?

156
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Okay. So if you were coming to our desert warfare training and you're a new lieutenant, the first thing I'm going to do is okay. I'm going to say, okay, here's maneuver number one.

157
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Here's maneuver number two. Here's maneuver number three. Here's maneuver number four. You got those basic form moves, right?

158
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000
You got form moves that you're going to do. So what a contact front, you know, the enemy's out front. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to close terrain.

159
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Oh, the enemy's out front. You're an open terrain to different move, but there's there's a there's a basic number of moves that you're going to go through.

160
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
That's where we're going to start is this what's happening or do you already know these moves?

161
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Yeah, when you show up to top gun as a student, you know all the moves. You have to have demonstrated some proficiency in all the moves to even get there.

162
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Give me an example of let's go. Let's just teach me a couple moves.

163
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Yeah. So and you know at this point, I'm going to call this.

164
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:33.000
If you're not watching on this on YouTube, I'm imagining you might start moving your hands around a little bit, which is, you know, cool with me, but I don't want to keep saying the whole time trying to describe what you're doing.

165
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
If you start talking with your hands, which you might, maybe you won't, but teach me a couple moves right now.

166
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Yeah. So when you start in the, we start in the one against one phase. So it's pretty straightforward as your airplane and my airplane, same exact airplane.

167
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
You're flying it as a student. I'm flying it as an instructor.

168
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And like you said before, each phase, the instructor will demo a brief, but after that the flight lead and the person running it is the student.

169
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
So he runs the brief. He runs the flight and he runs the debrief. And obviously the instructor's there to support through it.

170
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
But the first set of moves would be when we, what we call offensive BFF, which means I start behind you.

171
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000
I'm going to be a firm. Sorry. Good question. Basic fighter maneuvers. So offensive BFF is the first flight you do, which is one against one.

172
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:26.000
And I am being set up by design in an offensive position to fight to dog fight you. So we're going to do a dog fight and we're going to set it up on purpose that I start behind you.

173
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And so I'm going to put you in a defensive position and put me in an offensive position.

174
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And the only real objective there is kind of three objectives is the first thing I need to do is I can prove that I can stay behind you.

175
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Which is going to require me to do your the instructor.

176
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I'm the student. Okay.

177
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
As the lead.

178
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
You want to be, yeah, let me do that.

179
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Me the student is because I'm going to have more dumb questions.

180
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Perfect.

181
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
So I'm the student.

182
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
You're the instructor.

183
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Yes.

184
00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:00.000
The first thing we do is I'm going to start behind you. Is that right? No. So I got a backwards. So if we're going to do offensive BFF, you're the student.

185
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
You're going to lead the flight. You will be offensive starting all day.

186
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
So when we start the flight and we do those four sets, all four sets, you will be behind me.

187
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I'll be the instructor and your job is to maintain that offensive position.

188
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And the moves that you're going to do during that, there's only like three moves.

189
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
The first is called an offensive break turn, which means that when I react to you as a defender, I don't like this because you're over my shoulder.

190
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
I'm going to try to shake you.

191
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
You have to show the timing and the sight picture to maneuver your airplane to stay behind me.

192
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
And then the next move might be is that you have to be able to do a maneuver to avoid flying into the ground.

193
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And we have a simulated ground. So we say 5,000 feet to the ground.

194
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:51.000
You have to do another maneuver that you can show me that you can transition down to the bottom of the flight and the deck correctly.

195
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
And then the last move you might be trying to do is that you can put yourself in a position to employ a weapon.

196
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Now you know how to do all those things. You know how to do a break turn.

197
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
So a break turn is I'm turning my aircraft.

198
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
It's a U-turned years. Are you doing like a a a a a a shock and drive here where you go a little bit in one way and then you break?

199
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
No the way is there anything like that that's not.

200
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
No there's not. So there's that because we're keeping it basic.

201
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:24.000
No, it's because there's actually kind of a science behind it. And there's in each situation, especially in this rudimentary phase of one against one,

202
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
There's essentially one optimal way to maneuver your aircraft.

203
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:38.000
And it's different with your defensive than if you're offensive, but as a as an offensive, so I'm offensive as the student or your offensive as a student.

204
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
You don't have like 14 different things you can do.

205
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
As a matter of fact, you kind of have one and what you need to be able to do is do it exactly right because if you're one second to late.

206
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:57.000
10 knots too slow or any number of other variables off you're giving away chance for me to get away from you.

207
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
So for you to stay offensive and keep that offensive position that I've given you, you have to perform that maneuver correctly.

208
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Does the defensive guy shut can drive a little bit?

209
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
No, to be quite honest with the defensive guy does is pulls directly at the offensive airplane pulls right out of him.

210
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Close as the space as much as he can try to create some space limit the space.

211
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
And then I'm going to maneuver away from you based on how well that you do your turn.

212
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And if you do it right all day, eventually you're going to end up in the same place that you started.

213
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
I will not respond by like you said, shocking you're driving or maneuvering until I see what you've done.

214
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Okay, so you're just being nice.

215
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
I am flying my airplane the best way that I can until I see how you respond to that.

216
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
And if you do it correctly, then I'll have to start doing other maneuvers.

217
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
But if I just break into you and just pull my airplane right into yours really.

218
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Hard turn, call it a break turn.

219
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And you as the offender are really late or screw up a timing or go too fast or miss the cues to do it.

220
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
There's not much for me to do.

221
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I don't have to do much because you've given away that offensive advantage.

222
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
So you're flying flat, dumb and happy.

223
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
I come in behind you.

224
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Yep.

225
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And you're just going to add some moment boom, you're going to turn left, right, whatever.

226
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
And I just have to track you and stay behind.

227
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
That's exactly right.

228
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
It seems very simple.

229
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
It seems very simple.

230
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Do you even head fake?

231
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Right?

232
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Because can I see, can I see your head and your canopy?

233
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
So the way that the ranges that we start are typically a half a mile a mile and a mile and a half.

234
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Those are kind of just the pre-determined ranges.

235
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
So you're way, way, way out there.

236
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Actually, for most of those, you know, at least the start you're using the radar as a cue to determine that range.

237
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
You kind of have some eyeball calibration.

238
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
But the head fake, again, someone who knows what's going on and all it does is just give away more of that.

239
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
The head fake doesn't help you.

240
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
The best thing you can do is just break hard.

241
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Max performance.

242
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
What if I was a meag, you know, and I was going after you, what's the best thing?

243
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I'm on your channel.

244
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
What's the best thing you can do?

245
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Same thing.

246
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Exactly.

247
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
The tactics that we apply are the ones that we use in the role.

248
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
How is it not good to give a little shock and then go the other direction?

249
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Because what that does is that creates separation between our aircraft.

250
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
And if I'm offensive, and I'm the guy attacking on behind you, I want separation to be a

251
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:26.000
maneuver, and pull on my weapons, saddle in the way that I want, and adjust the situation, the way that I'm looking to have it be offensive for me.

252
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
If you minimize that separation and create a bunch of closure, meaning we're now closing the distance,

253
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I have a whole bunch of maneuvering I have to do to manage that closure, which I don't want to do.

254
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
So when I'm on defense, I want you closer to this.

255
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Yes.

256
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
When I'm on defense, I want you closer to me.

257
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
That's correct.

258
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Okay.

259
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Interesting.

260
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Interesting.

261
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Just like you get to, your optimal position on offense is to have their back, because they can't see properly.

262
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
They don't have any weapons that shoot backwards, right?

263
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
No.

264
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
You're right.

265
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
So just like you get to, you want to get the person's back.

266
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Yes.

267
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
So that's where we're at.

268
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
So this is, this is day one.

269
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
We're doing this.

270
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
So all we're doing, so that's one move. You just taught me one move.

271
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
I'm sorry. It took so long.

272
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
No, I'm not the smartest guy in the world.

273
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
The first thing you teach me is, I'm just going to break.

274
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And well, now it's, I'm, I'm going to break and, and you're going to follow me.

275
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Okay. What's the next move?

276
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Moves two.

277
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
So you teach me three moves.

278
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Yeah, I teach three moves.

279
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
So remember, you're the student.

280
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
You're offense.

281
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Because right now this, this is easy.

282
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
I'm ready to be a top of it.

283
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Yeah.

284
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
You want to do his break? Are you kidding me? Let's do this. Like I did.

285
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Well, the interesting thing about the offensive break turn that I just taught you.

286
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
The percentage of students that get that right in the beginning is zero zero.

287
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And the percentage of the time that you get it exactly right, meaning you've hit all your parameters,

288
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
is even by the end, is still really low.

289
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Now, you've narrowed your error window pretty, pretty, pretty small.

290
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
But even just the simple, when do I do my turn and when do I identify all the cues and

291
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
exactly what to do and exactly how to make it happen?

292
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Just doing that very first move is almost impossible for a student to do quick at the first time.

293
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
So let's say, I said, oh, what about a head fake, right?

294
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
If I'm in the offense of position behind you,

295
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I can see the very first indicator.

296
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
As soon as I see your flaps do whatever they move a little bit and I'm on it.

297
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Yes.

298
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
The quicker I react, the better I stay with you.

299
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Yeah.

300
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
The more you can observe and there's multiple cues out there.

301
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
It's the angle of your airplane.

302
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
It's whether or not your afterburners have opened up.

303
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
It's your angle over the horizon.

304
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
It's how quickly you're moving.

305
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
It's whether you're rotating or transitioning through the sky.

306
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
There's a whole bunch of cues out there that you have to be able to identify in real time.

307
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
As you're moving typically 400 and something not.

308
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
So the closure is happening really fast.

309
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
You have seconds to get this right.

310
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
You call it closure, but we're both moving in the same direction, right?

311
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Not when I break back into you.

312
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
So if I've got this guy behind you and you break your breaking into me,

313
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
you're turning into me creating even more closure.

314
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
So picture me, let's picture you flying around and you look over your shoulder and you think,

315
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
and you don't realize this.

316
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Now all of a sudden you see somebody's there.

317
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
They're behind you and they're in a really good position to shoot.

318
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
The only place for you to go to keep him from shooting you is towards him.

319
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Because if you continue straight ahead or just kind of maneuver around left and right,

320
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
I just stay back there.

321
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
So you have to get, you have to turn back into me to close that distance.

322
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Yes, that's exactly like, for sure, man.

323
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Exactly like you did, sir.

324
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Yes, right?

325
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
You, as long as you're looking away as long as they have your back, you're doomed.

326
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
So your goal, you have to turn back towards them.

327
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
That's right.

328
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
It's weird for me, I think, conceptually because this is taking place over a long distance, right?

329
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Yeah, like I, when I'm trying to turn back into you, it takes, how long does it takes to turn back into him?

330
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
A minute, 30 seconds?

331
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
No, seconds.

332
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Seconds.

333
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Seconds.

334
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Yeah.

335
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:18.000
So you will go from the time that you say fights on, which you would say and then I would start to turn into you.

336
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
If you did nothing and just flew straight ahead, I would be passed you in four seconds.

337
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Hmm.

338
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
I did a dog fight in an F-18.

339
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
I did a bunch of I did a backseat ride up in Fallon.

340
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
And I did a dog fight, I did a bomb run.

341
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:43.000
It was really cool, but one thing, and I saw and did with the pilot guy was, you can fish tail.

342
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Is this right?

343
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Am I perceiving this correctly?

344
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Like we turned, like our wingman or whatever, turned so hard, you could see them fish tailing totally through the sky.

345
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Yes.

346
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
So I guess that cuts down your amount of time that it takes to turn.

347
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Yeah.

348
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
And that's a cue.

349
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
You have to be able to see that and perceive that.

350
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
And if he's doing that maneuver that indicates how fast he's going, it indicates his angle of attack.

351
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
It gives you a whole bunch of information about what he's doing.

352
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
You need to be able to perceive that that's happening.

353
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
You can, in your own mind, you can figure as he turning a small circle of big circle.

354
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
You can calculate all those things in your brain as that's happening.

355
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
That is a cue that you need to know in that other plane as he's doing it.

356
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Are you getting taught these cues specifically?

357
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Yeah.

358
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
You know the cues.

359
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
You know the moves.

360
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
The planes are being flown in such a precise and aggressive way that they are hard to see.

361
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
And that's really what the debrief is about.

362
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Is dissecting the cues that you need to figure out in order to maneuver your airplane optimally.

363
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
It's probably no different than Jjitsu.

364
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
If you were to give me your back, say we're going to start Dave, I'm going to give you my back.

365
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
And all I want you to do is maintain that position.

366
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
How long do you think you would take you before I couldn't keep your back?

367
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
It would probably matter of seconds.

368
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Yeah.

369
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:02.000
But if you said, hey, as I start to lower my shoulder and I want you to kind of bring your hip towards me and you show me that.

370
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Now, there's probably 20 other things going on, but now I got that.

371
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
It's going to add another two seconds before you, before you out maneuver me.

372
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Now you eventually you will.

373
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And then you show me something else.

374
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
And now, so the goal is for me to incorporate all of those little individual things together.

375
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
And the eventual goal is that I've started this offense position and I never give it up.

376
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
So that's one move.

377
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
That's one move.

378
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
One move.

379
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
What's the offensive breaker?

380
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Off, offensive breaker.

381
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Turn, turn, what's the next move?

382
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
So the next move is when me is the instructor figure out, hey, you're doing a good job.

383
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
My defensive turn here isn't going to work for me.

384
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
He's just going to stay behind me.

385
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
He's going to shoot me.

386
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
I'm going to do something else.

387
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
You kind of call that I'm going to chuck and drive.

388
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
I'm as a defender.

389
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
I'm going to maneuver my airplane in a different plane of motion.

390
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
That first move didn't work.

391
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
You followed me.

392
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And if I keep going, you're going to shoot me.

393
00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000
So I have to do what's called the ditch, which I'm going to now point towards the ground and change this two dimensional fight into a three dimensional fight.

394
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Complicates the problem for you.

395
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
It gives you a different thing you've got to deal with.

396
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And now you have to figure out how to chase me, not just two dimensionally, but three dimensionally.

397
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
And you're going to have to follow my ditch.

398
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
And we just call that simply a ditch follow.

399
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
There's different terms for it.

400
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
But it's, can you now take this two dimensional flat fight and be as effective in a three dimensional fight,

401
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
which introduces a whole other level of complexity, now we're going downhill.

402
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
And this is the big thing that Dan kept talking about, depending on the aircraft that you have in the power that you have.

403
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
We're going to go from horizontal plane to vertical, vertical plane.

404
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:43.000
And so this ditch move is the first, the first movement into three dimensional out of the horizontal plane into this other plane.

405
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
That's exactly right.

406
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
That's exactly right.

407
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
And that seems pretty straightforward.

408
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
It does seem straightforward.

409
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
All of these maneuvers are straightforward.

410
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:58.000
How, what else do you out when you, what's the minimum altitude above ground that you can start this maneuver at this ditch?

411
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Depending on the airplane, a good rough number is between three and four thousand feet before you think,

412
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Hey, if I go much, if I'm much lower than that to the ground and I do it, I have a pretty good chance to hit in the ground.

413
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
You need several thousand feet to do it.

414
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Okay.

415
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Third move.

416
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:25.000
The third move is that when I get down to the, to the ground, the floor, you know, we call it the deck, but you're down towards the earth, we now have to do a deck transition, which means that now I can't move in vertically anymore.

417
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Because if I keep going downhill, I'll hit the ground.

418
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:40.000
So now I have to transition back into two dimensional fight and preserve my position in a two dimensional fight with the ground as a, as a component of this fight now, which was not a, not a factor of an altitude.

419
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.000
This means you're, you're having to just gain altitude again. Is that what we're doing?

420
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:56.000
The goal is to do one of two things either I now can gain altitude above him, or I can push him out in front of me and stay behind him.

421
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Either one of those work for me, but I need to have some separation from from the person I'm fighting, so I can employ my weapon.

422
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
I can't shoot the guy at zero feet away from him.

423
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
I have to have some distance between us. I can either have that distance above him or behind him.

424
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Just like you, just like this more moves into MMA, where if you're trying to hit me, I want to close the distance, get close to you, where your strikes won't really make a difference.

425
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Yeah, the, the parallels are, I mean, there might be some differences in terms of like the physical locations of the, of the machines against it with the people, but the parallels are exactly the same.

426
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:41.000
As a, as a person who's offensive, if you think about finishing somebody, and the way I'm going to finish is through a strike, which is kind of similar to what those weapons are,

427
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
I need to have some distance between you and me, to make that strike effective.

428
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Now, there's a distance that I, if I get too close, those strikes just don't work.

429
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000
There's also a way that if I get so far away, those strikes are ineffective, or it actually allows you to strike as well.

430
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000
And so I'm constantly managing, managing those, those separations and distances, and if I'm defensive, and I look over and I see that person's in a great place, it just threw a punch at me.

431
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:17.000
I can either try to get away from him, which almost never worked at that distance, although there is a separation that you might try to put, but at that, we started off was like, hey, you're starting in a place that we know running away won't work.

432
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
So that range of a half a mile a mile, it's designed to say the escape option is not available to you.

433
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:32.000
So the only other option is, is I got to close that distance to you. I can't let your strike be effective, and I'm going to wrap you up is best I can't do that. That's the defender's job.

434
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
So what's this third move called? The deck transition.

435
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Deck transition, but it sounds like there's multiple options on how you transition from the deck.

436
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:51.000
There are, and all those options are all accumulating, they're all in accumulation of how things have played out the entire way from the beginning of the fight down to the end of the fight.

437
00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:00.000
So remember, I started that fight 6,000 feet behind you. I'm a mile behind you. If you do everything right, and I do everything right, guess where I'm going to be at the deck transition.

438
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
A mile behind you. Six, six, six, six, six feet behind you. I'm going to be mile behind you, and I'm going to be good to go.

439
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:17.000
But if you've done a better job than I have, I've missed some cues. I'm a little bit late. I'll lose 500 feet here. I'll lose 75 feet here. I'll lose a thousand feet over here.

440
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:32.000
I'll lose another 50 feet here. And each one of those moves that I'm doing down to the floor, you've chipped away by the time we get down to the floor. You know where the fights against offender structures usually end up, either zero or nurse, the defender has become the attacker, which happens sometimes.

441
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000
So that 6,000 feet, it's pretty uncommon to be able to preserve that distance against a top-gun instructor from beginning to end.

442
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:47.000
And each part of the fight and each maneuver that's being executed, you're gathering, you're fighting for that distance. Again, apologize.

443
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
I'm the student, you're the instructor. I start off 6,000 feet behind you.

444
00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:01.000
You break, turn, you do it successfully. You're now closer to me. Yes.

445
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:15.000
And then you break, turn again, and you're even closer to me. And you break, turn again, you're even closer. Then you ditch and you get even closer. And then finally, you either are so close to me that you're behind me.

446
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
That happens. What's the other thing? If you don't get behind me, what if we're just now where really close?

447
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:34.000
So just realize, obviously, we're not going to get so close that we're going to hit. And so that distance of going from 6,000 feet a mile to being something less than that. If we were zero feet apart, we'd be parallel right beside each other.

448
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.000
We wouldn't be zero feet, obviously, the airplanes have a safety bubble between them. But when we transition down to the ground, I'd look across.

449
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:51.000
And instead of being directly behind you, I'd be directly beside you. And I'd have no way to shoot you just looking at you side by side. We'd be in a completely neutral position where nobody can shoot the other person.

450
00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:02.000
And I've given away an entire mile of advantage that you gave me, or that I gave you with the start as the student.

451
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Okay. We're doing good. I mean, there's something still a little bit hard for me to understand at this point. You two, you two echo Charles.

452
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:19.000
A little bit, but I guess so, because I keep got to remember that the distances are way far away. Like you don't want to watch top gun.

453
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
It's like, oh, they're like right there and they're shooting each other. And you know, but they're like super far away.

454
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:39.000
But they're also kind of not because it's only a, it's a second or it's two seconds or whatever to travel that mile. Well, the best thing I could do other than explain this better would be to erase from everybody's memory, the movie top gun.

455
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Because that's where your head's going. This isn't going to work.

456
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Well, yeah, because you're like, hey, close the distance. So I'm like, okay, close the distance. But then yes, you got to remember as well that there is no, because essentially like, okay, like you're in a duty to remember where it's like

457
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Green zone meaning save zone if you're too far away from the guy you can't punch a kick you whatever.

458
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Green zone when you're close, he can't punch and kick your effect. But there's the red zone, which is that distance, right? So in, if a, and correct me if I'm wrong if I'm trying to understand this, too, where that initial green zone, the out of range green zone.

459
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
That's not an option in this particular drill.

460
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
What is it? What is it? Is it like 10 miles, 12 miles?

461
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:26.000
The separation in terms if I'm on your tail, how far away are you from me that I bet you're not in danger miles.

462
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Yeah, several miles. Yeah, and that's not an option for this particular drill.

463
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
It's designed this one. Oh, and so on phase. We build it where you running away at the start. You can't do it. You can't just go faster than me.

464
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
So you start.

465
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
We start on behind you, you're in the red zone.

466
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And you want to close the distance, get close enough to me that I can't find my wife. That's another green zone.

467
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Right? The close green zone. Yeah. Well, he's behind me. My goal is to, they kick that six thousand feet separation and make it zero.

468
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Yeah. Or as close to it as I can get. Yeah.

469
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
It's like closing the distance in your jutsu base.

470
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Don't want you. Okay.

471
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Don't you, when you hit a break turn, and I'm slow, doesn't that make me further away from you?

472
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
No, because I'm turning back towards you.

473
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
You're behind me. I'm rolling my plane and pulling it directly into your plane.

474
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.000
And I'm literally going to point right at you as hard as I can and take whatever that I can get, whatever that six thousand feet is.

475
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
And close as much distance as I can as fast as I can.

476
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
And I'm not going to get much, but I'm going to get something.

477
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
What's the turning radius of an F-18?

478
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:46.000
It's totally air speed dependent, but at the speeds that we're talking about, the turning radius is probably 3,000, 4000 feet.

479
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Dang.

480
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
That's tight.

481
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Yeah. Well, when you're slower, it's much tighter.

482
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
The slower you get, the shorter your radius is.

483
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Okay.

484
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
And so even that point that you made about the turning radius, that's a massive calculation.

485
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
You're getting deployed right there.

486
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:11.000
You know what your airplane is capable of doing at 18,000 feet at 400 knots in full after burger.

487
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Because it's different than what your airplane can do at 10,000 feet at 250 knots.

488
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
And it's varies in every three-dimensional plane.

489
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
It varies.

490
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:28.000
And I have to figure out, I'm going to determine what your airplane is capable of doing and base my maneuver, part of my maneuver, base on that.

491
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.000
That's why these simple moves are so complex in terms of implementation getting it right, because there's so many things going on.

492
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Because even your physical ability in your aircraft changes base in your altitude in your speed.

493
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
It's constantly a variable.

494
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
It isn't.

495
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
You have a team just as this.

496
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Every single altitude, every single air speed, every single throttle position has a different output capability that you're able to generate dramatic differences.

497
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Yeah.

498
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Very dramatic. What an airplane can do at 15,000 feet versus what an airplane can do at 5,000 feet is dramatic.

499
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Be a different percentage wise.

500
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Just rough percentage wise.

501
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.000
You probably have your turn radius of probably a third the size that low altitude then it would be up at altitude.

502
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.000
So instead of you're talking through to 4,000 feet, you're talking closer to, and I'll just keep it generic, but you know, a thousand to 1,500 window.

503
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Much, much, much smaller.

504
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Okay. So we get done with our first three engagements on my first flight.

505
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
I did whatever job.

506
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
You know, I did a pretty crappy job because no one does it the first time.

507
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
That's right.

508
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Okay. So now we come back in for the debrief.

509
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000
And what do we look, are we looking at a dry erase board? Are we picking up the little planes with the sticks on them?

510
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Both.

511
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
You're looking at a straight up dry erase board with colored pens.

512
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Do we have video? Yep. And we got video. We've got the what's called the HUD view, essentially the first person view of the pilots view of both aircraft.

513
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Do you replay like the radar as well or not really?

514
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Not in the 101 phase.

515
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
True dimensional.

516
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Yeah. Well, it's not that it's two dimensional.

517
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
It's that, you know, you just only want aircraft.

518
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
So in terms of how you're managing that system is not that important.

519
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
When you account for how well you shot your weapons, you might look at that.

520
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:21.000
But 95% of what you're looking at is just the altitude and the air speed and the angle of attack of each airplane through that pilots view.

521
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Okay.

522
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
So now your debriefing me how much do I as the student?

523
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
What percentage, you go, okay, Jocca, what'd you see up there?

524
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
You've got how many points do you have on your checklist?

525
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Me and the stakes that I made.

526
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Instructor.

527
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
20.

528
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Okay. How many do I get? How many do you say you tell me to debrief? How many do I?

529
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
And I'm a humble guy. Yeah.

530
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
And I have a good attitude and I'm trying to give you a good percentage.

531
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Do I get, do I get seven? Do I get ten?

532
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I was going to say five or six on day one. You're going to get five or six.

533
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
You're going to get the big ones. You're going to get the big ones.

534
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Again, you've known these maneuvers.

535
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
You've been flying at 15s for three years.

536
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
You've been through a training course.

537
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
You're going to get all the big ones for the most part.

538
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
You know, here and there, we, we, we, some folks kind of get overwhelmed with the most part.

539
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
You've got the big ones.

540
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
You're now doing an assessment of me.

541
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Like, this is just in your own head.

542
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Because are we paired up for the whole time where it's off gone? Is it you and me?

543
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
No, no, but you're going to see me five more times eight more times.

544
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Whatever the numbers.

545
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
You're looking at me and you're going, yeah.

546
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Or you're going, um, guys, got some potential.

547
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
It's not bad.

548
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Is that based on my experience?

549
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Is that based on, uh, the time I've gotten the aircraft?

550
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Is it based on, hey, this guy's got a little natural ability.

551
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Yeah, I think it's all the above, man.

552
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
It is.

553
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
I've listened to you talk about this when you first lock up in your jutsu.

554
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And you, you, you don't know a hundred percent of this other guy.

555
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
But you know a lot right away.

556
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Right away.

557
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
It's the exact same thing.

558
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Almost on that first turn.

559
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000
When I'm the instructor, and I'm looking over my shoulder on your very first break turn,

560
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
I'll get about 75% of what I knew about you in that turn.

561
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
And sometimes it's like, oh man, okay.

562
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
This is going to be a lot's of learning.

563
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Yeah.

564
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
And that's like damn, that was, that was pretty good.

565
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
And you can feel that in a very same way in an airplane.

566
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
It does not tell the whole story.

567
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:28.000
But it gives you a really good cue and a really good indicator of who that person is in terms of flying the airplane.

568
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And that's a big part of it.

569
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
But I am much less concerned about how well you flew your machine.

570
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
And I am about how well you can explain what happened.

571
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
And so the debrief is still a huge part of what my assessment is about you.

572
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
And I won't really know what that debrief is going to be like until we get in there.

573
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.000
But if you show me if we lock up and I feel like you're in the game and you fly a really good airplane,

574
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
I bet you that your debrief's going to be really solid.

575
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000
If I'm out there with a kid who's all over the place, he can barely keep his plane right near to be.

576
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
It's very likely his debrief's going to be just as bad.

577
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000
You know what's interesting is this.

578
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
I'm thinking about this idea of when you lock up with someone on the GJ2 mats of justice.

579
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000
You could lock up with nine different types of people.

580
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000
And they all feel totally different.

581
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:30.000
But the indicators that you're getting are providing you with messaging that you have to have a high-end view.

582
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:36.000
You have a high depth of knowledge to understand my clear examples.

583
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
You get the guy that's just super strong.

584
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
And he's super strong.

585
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
So you feel all this tension.

586
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
But you know as soon as you lock up with him, you go, oh, he's strong.

587
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
He doesn't know what he's doing.

588
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Right? Like that's crazy that you can sense he's really strong, but he doesn't have GJ2.

589
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:03.000
You lock up with someone that's all lanky and skinny and pale and just, and you lock up and they're weak.

590
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000
They're weak and you lock up with them and you go, oh, oh, this guy's got some skills.

591
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000
You can tell that when you lock up even though the messaging that you're getting to your brain is totally opposite.

592
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
They're totally opposite.

593
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
And the occasion you get someone that you lock up with you like, oh, this person's strong.

594
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
And they know GJ2, this is gonna be fun. This is gonna be a challenge.

595
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000
But it's interesting that you can gather all that from, we just, you know, what that lock up.

596
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
And maybe a little bit of a, you know, a little bit of movement.

597
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
I'm gonna talk in two seconds and move in three seconds and move in.

598
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000
You're like, okay, this is gonna suck. This is gonna be hard.

599
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Or, okay, I'm gonna weather the storm here, this guy's strong, but he's no de doing.

600
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.000
That's a, I don't know if that's completely unique to GJ2 and maybe you're getting guys that,

601
00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Do you notice, do you notice that level of understanding based on this guy's, you know, initial reactions?

602
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
You get a, you get a good read.

603
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
The way you described it, I think is exactly how I would describe it.

604
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
You get a good read.

605
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
It doesn't determine the outcome.

606
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000
You don't know everything, but in those, and I'll call it the,

607
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000
You said first three, four seconds, it's really the first one or two turns.

608
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000
You watch a couple of turns out of a guy, you know what you're dealing with for the most part.

609
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000
And you know what a good turn looks like, then you know what a weak turn looks like.

610
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
And if a guy gives you two weak turns, you kind of know how it's gonna play out.

611
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
What, what is a good turn look like? What does a bad turn look like?

612
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000
A good turn versus a bad turn is a good turn is his,

613
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
His angle towards you is exactly where it's supposed to be.

614
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
There's no too high or no too low.

615
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
It's exactly on the plane that it's supposed to be down to the degree and you're like,

616
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Wow, like he gave me, he gave away nothing in that turn.

617
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Because I can over steer.

618
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000
You can, you can over steer.

619
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
I can understand.

620
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
That's right. You can do both.

621
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
You can pull not enough.

622
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
You can pull too much.

623
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
You can overturn.

624
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
You can under turn.

625
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
You could be a little late under after burger.

626
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000
You could be a little early under after burger and get going a little too fast.

627
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
And it opens up your circle even bigger, which gives me even more room.

628
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000
And so the margin of that of the four or five things that you're in control of,

629
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
You got to get them now.

630
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Hold on.

631
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Yeah.

632
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
You just said it gives you more room.

633
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
It gives you more room.

634
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Because I hit, I thought you, I thought you wanted to have more room.

635
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Oh, no, you want to close.

636
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Okay, I got it.

637
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:27.000
I got it.

638
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
No, it's definitely confusing to me.

639
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Yeah.

640
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
And I need to kind of, maybe as we keep talking, I'll try to,

641
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.000
There's a lot of what we're talking about here in this one against one.

642
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000
That's, that's really cool and reveals a lot of things.

643
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.000
But it's a really small part of what we're asking folks to do a top gun and what you're really trying to train to.

644
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:55.000
And I need to just explain it a little bit more simply and more room to mention in a way that hey,

645
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
What the objectives are.

646
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
So that, as we talk more about what top gun is, it'll make more sense.

647
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000
It's just, it's not quite as simple as I want to close the gap and you want to close the gap.

648
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
What I'm really trying to maneuver to is a place where I can employ a weapon.

649
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
And now there's like this weapon has this minimum max range.

650
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
This weapon has this minimum max range.

651
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
And I might try to start for a gunshot, but like, oh, that's going to be hard.

652
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
So it may be all maneuver to a missile shot.

653
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Well, this missile has this envelope.

654
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Well, I'm not telling that, but this missile has another envelope.

655
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
So there's a lot of overlapping things.

656
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000
I think the biggest takeaway is, is that in order for me as the defender,

657
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.000
or you as the attacker, the offensive airplane, for either of us to succeed in our role,

658
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000
the margin of error at top gun is really small.

659
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000
The capacity to identify your mistakes and those errors is what the real test is.

660
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:54.000
And that happens in the debrief, but you can fly a plane against another aircraft and look over the horizon and watch,

661
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
I could fly against you.

662
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
And I can tell from the way you move your plane through the sky, how good you are.

663
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
And I can see it and I can feel it and I can watch it and I can calculate it.

664
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000
And I can most of the time in the first two turns, tell you exactly how the fight's going to play out.

665
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Now, if you show up and you give me those first two turns are everybody's good as mine.

666
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Now it's like, man, I don't know how this is going to, now you're in a real fight.

667
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Student against the structure, it just doesn't happen.

668
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Yes, it just can't bring that level of capability in that performance.

669
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
You're never contemplating the outcome.

670
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:36.000
You're mostly contemplating how well they minimize their errors and how well they optimize their performance to give away as little as possible.

671
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Okay, so in the debrief, you're like, hey, you know, you, you pulled too hard.

672
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Here's what happened.

673
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Look right here.

674
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
See, see this, you pulled too hard.

675
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
That's why I'm drifting out of the screen or whatever, because you pulled too hard.

676
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Uh, is this something like, okay, cool, got it. Is it a relatively easy thing for me to note and I'm learning it?

677
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.000
It's like, oh, I mean, in your jitz who I'd say, hey, echo, you know, you're, you need to get you, you squeeze your knees together, right on an armlock.

678
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Hey, you could have done better, but you, your knees will lose.

679
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Squeeze your knees next time.

680
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000
And that's something he can factually start doing like at that next armlock.

681
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000
He tries it again and boom, he tightens knees and he gets it.

682
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000
So this is the similar level of correction and ability to do.

683
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Yeah, it's almost immediate because everything I'm telling you, you understand.

684
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
I'm not teaching you a concept and I'm not showing you a move that you don't know.

685
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000
I'm revealing a little bit of an error that, you know, hey, what you did here was just, I hate you need it.

686
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
You need to have your hips here and you need to have your arm here.

687
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000
But you, you get that, you're like, oh man, I can actually recall that my hips weren't where you said that makes sense.

688
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Now that I'm seeing this.

689
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
And typically the way you would have that work is, hey, do you think you're early or early?

690
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Do you think you're early or late on this entry here?

691
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Mm-hmm.

692
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
I'm super late.

693
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
I'm like, yeah, why do you think you're late?

694
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Well, first I saw your airplane kind of move, which tells me I'm late.

695
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
But I also look up and you're doing this airspeed 470.

696
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Hey, you know if you're doing 470, you should have turned already, right?

697
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
So what's the, and see, like, hey, I need to start this turn sooner.

698
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
And I need to look for different things.

699
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
And you can go out in the very next flight and almost immediately make that correction.

700
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
So that's good.

701
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
So where we, where we're at right there is.

702
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
I like, I caught this.

703
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000
I saw your airplane move, so I knew I was late.

704
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
I've said this about you, Jitsu.

705
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
If you have to think about the move, your 2A.

706
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000
If I take a second, if I go, oh, echo's arm is available right now.

707
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
I think I'm going to go for it.

708
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000
He already defended it.

709
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Yeah.

710
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000
I had to have felt it and acted on it.

711
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
That's something.

712
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
That's exactly the same thing.

713
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
What do you see?

714
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Yeah.

715
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000
What do you see?

716
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000
What's a little indicator?

717
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000
So the indicator is if I'm far enough away as you're turning.

718
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
So you're offensive.

719
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.000
If I'm far enough away and you're watching me and you're looking for a queue on when you should start your turn.

720
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
If I'm far enough away, I kind of just, I appear to just be rotating in the sky.

721
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Because I'm so far, you don't see it.

722
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
You don't see the lateral movie.

723
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
You don't see my airplane moving across the sky.

724
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Almost appear to be stationary.

725
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
But the closer I get and you can picture this.

726
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Like seeing something far away doesn't have a high crossing rate and something like a car.

727
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
You look at a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car.

728
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.000
I'm going to see it moving back and forth and as it gets close, you see this movement back and forth and it's a lot easier to see.

729
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:30.000
What we tell people is you look for the queue that when he stops being stationary in the sky and starts to move across the sky,

730
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000
you're at the range at which you should start to turn your airplane.

731
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
The problem is, is I'm certainly staring at going, okay, I'm waiting for him to move.

732
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
I'm waiting for him, okay, I see him starting to move.

733
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
And then it's your late.

734
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:50.000
And so it's that visual cue of rotating to translating to the sky, which occurs at an exact range.

735
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.000
It's a mathematical range of which you can see that.

736
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
You have about a second to be on time.

737
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
And if you're a second early or a second late, you miss that window.

738
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
And if you're looking for it, it's too late.

739
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000
You're looking for the attitude.

740
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Is that the right word, the attitude of the aircraft?

741
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000
No, you're looking for the way the aircraft moves.

742
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
I would call it the crossing rate.

743
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:22.000
So if I'm five miles away from you and I'm staring at you, you could be moving pretty aggressively,

744
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
but I don't have to move my head to keep up with you.

745
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
You're so far away, you're just a little dot.

746
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000
You're just moving.

747
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000
The closer I get, the more it's obvious, I could, oh, he's actually moving back and forth.

748
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000
You know, these really small turns actually, the closer get our huge turns.

749
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:42.000
And so at some point, the turn of you rotating through the sky actually appears to be moving across the sky.

750
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Got it.

751
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000
That range, I'll say it roughly a mile, just keep it simple.

752
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000
That's the point at which you can, you can, that transition from rotating to moving.

753
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
That's about at that mile and you have to know where that is.

754
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000
As soon as that happens, you have to start turning.

755
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And I'm, I'm teaching you to look for that.

756
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Now, you already know, that's, you already know what that is.

757
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
You can explain it.

758
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
You can teach it.

759
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:15.000
But it's the ability to do it against an aircraft moving as dynamically and as aggressively as I'm going to be when you're fighting me is where the challenge comes from.

760
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:26.000
And to prepare for this, to come to school, a lot of the guys you've been flying with don't show you the optimal maneuvers.

761
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
They show you a pretty good maneuver, but not an ideal maneuver.

762
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And that's just because they're lack of ability.

763
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
They're just not as good.

764
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And, you know, you've talked about when, when guys like Dean train to go fight in the UFC, they don't just have one training partner.

765
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
They have one guy who's exceptionally good at, maybe this one, that he's really good at grappling.

766
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Maybe this guy's really good at striking.

767
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Maybe this guy's really good at judicious.

768
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And he's going to train to be really good in all those things.

769
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
That's supposed to just, his training partner, well, he's a little weak in this, but he's my training partner.

770
01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Hey, if my training partner has some strength here, but he's not great here, you're going to show up to top gun and we're talking about this one particular skill.

771
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Skill, you're going to get overwhelmed.

772
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.000
All right, so how many flights do we do like this where we're just one on one?

773
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Five, six.

774
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Do you ever go as the instructor? Do you ever go on offense?

775
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Or is that just too easy or is that part of it?

776
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
That's part of it. That's, that's the next flight.

777
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
The next flight.

778
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Yep. Once you, you don't let me get another crack at the title.

779
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Well, if you're, if you're fight is so bad that you couldn't even stay behind me, we're going to go do it again.

780
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But as soon as you prove to me, hey, you've demonstrated that you're good enough.

781
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You understand what's happening, that you can maintain this offensive position. We're moving on.

782
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Didn't you say zero people execute a good turn?

783
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Zero.

784
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
But that turn.

785
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
So a marginal turn still keeps me in the game.

786
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
You're going to have four different sets.

787
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
So I'm hoping that each one gets a little bit better.

788
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
If you have one of those three ranges that wasn't going to have you do it again. Hey, let's do that.

789
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Ninth thousand foot one real quick. Let's do it again. Show me one more.

790
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And if you're in the window and then in the debrief, you can really explain to me what your errors were.

791
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And I truly think that you understand what those were.

792
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I don't need you to go do it again.

793
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
If I finish the debrief and I can tell you're lost, I can tell you don't really know what happened.

794
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And you didn't really execute and can't explain why.

795
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
We're going to go re-fly that until you do it again.

796
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
How many out of ten how many would you have to reload?

797
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Out of ten pilots how many do you have to reload and say you know what?

798
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Eight.

799
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Maybe nine.

800
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Nine out of ten.

801
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
My my class.

802
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
What did you say is the next flight we're already doing something else that sounds like we need to do this.

803
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Yeah, yeah.

804
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Well, what we skipped is something I've mentioned you once before.

805
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Most of those reloads.

806
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You don't even get to the debrief.

807
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
We do what's called an immediate refly.

808
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
We land. We go back and I say, jaco.

809
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Don't take off your flight gear.

810
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Sign for this airplane.

811
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
We're going right back out and doing it.

812
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Don't you want to tell me what I did wrong?

813
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I'm going to.

814
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And in the time that it takes to walk from the airplane to maintenance to sign for the airplane and go back to the airplane.

815
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And that 15 minutes.

816
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
You're not going to talk for the entire 15 minutes.

817
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Hey, I want you to start looking for this.

818
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
You're consistently late.

819
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Look for this queue pay attention to this.

820
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Hey, and you just slow down relax.

821
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
You're going too fast here.

822
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
You're going too slow here.

823
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And I'm going to give you three or four things to think about.

824
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And we're going to go do it again.

825
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And that's usually enough to get you to kind of get back your composure and get back to doing again.

826
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And my first when I went through is a student.

827
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Only one student in my class got passed the first flight on the first try.

828
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
One guy was his name Dave.

829
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
It was not.

830
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
He was a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit.

831
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
It was pretty epic.

832
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
It was not me.

833
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I was lucky enough that I had one refly.

834
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And it was that very first flight.

835
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I reflued that first flight on a immediate refly.

836
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And I never reflued a flight again, which was kind of crazy.

837
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Did you kind of want to get more refly?

838
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So you get more time flying?

839
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
No, I didn't.

840
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I wanted to pass the flight on the first try.

841
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
They, we could tell the story some of the time.

842
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
But I got plenty of flight time.

843
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But I wanted to pass.

844
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I wanted to do well enough of my first flight to pass.

845
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
That's what I wanted to do when I was there.

846
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Okay, so now we finished with this one on one.

847
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Yep.

848
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
What's?

849
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Well, we finished with the first flight.

850
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Now, so I was on offense.

851
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Now you're going to go on offense.

852
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And I'm trying to shake you.

853
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Yeah, you're going to be on defense.

854
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
We're just going to swap rules.

855
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And all I'm doing is doing a freaking tight turn.

856
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
That's it.

857
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
There's no shock.

858
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
There's no drive.

859
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
It seems.

860
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Why is it seem like that just like I could do something a little bit better.

861
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Yeah.

862
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I'm like, how come you guys couldn't think like me?

863
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Yeah.

864
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I mean, I think that you just you parallel is probably pretty good.

865
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
If you're an hour going out there and I'm just going to,

866
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
and I just start getting wild with you and just turn to some of these crazy things.

867
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And I'm trying to throw these crazy moves your way to try to shake you.

868
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Is it really going to be a problem for you?

869
01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
No.

870
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Is it going to make it easier for you?

871
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yeah, it's going to make it easier than if I just do exactly what I'm supposed to do.

872
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And there's sort of one or two things that I really have to do.

873
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I have to put my body in this place.

874
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I have to put my weight in this place for this to work.

875
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And if I don't have those two, all the other stuff that I'm doing for you is it's like,

876
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
what are you doing man?

877
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Like it's just almost like it's just, it does,

878
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
it does nothing but make it easier for you to attack my position.

879
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
That being said,

880
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
if you're on defense as the instructor,

881
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
you can do a break and ditch a deck transition and then another break and then another,

882
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
like you can pile these moves on top of one another, right?

883
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Oh yeah, I mean this happens multiple times in a flight.

884
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Yeah, you're doing ditch and ditch and ditch and ditch and,

885
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
the, the tapping several times.

886
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
It's not just three moves.

887
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
That those moves, sign in the middle of several times.

888
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
So those are the moves that.

889
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Yes.

890
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
The moves are, those are the moves.

891
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
So, in GJ2,

892
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
this is a really easy way to explain this,

893
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
to escaping the mount, right?

894
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
When you escape the mount,

895
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
you can either, basically,

896
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
you can either open the guy over your left shoulder,

897
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
over your right shoulder,

898
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
you can knee escape or you can elbow escape the right,

899
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
their right leg or your, or their left leg, right?

900
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
That's, you can go in any one of those four spots.

901
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And, you know, this is actually Dean Lister, material.

902
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
You can go, you, so you have to try a first.

903
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
When it doesn't work, you, you can try b.

904
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
When that doesn't work, you can try c.

905
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
When that doesn't work, you can try d.

906
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
When that doesn't work, you go back to a.

907
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
But the way you actually escape is a.

908
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
d, b, c, d, b, d, b, a, c, b, d, b, b.

909
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
b, b, b, b, b, and the wrong.

910
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
That, that's what, so this is the same thing.

911
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah, when you said, hey,

912
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
teach me the moves.

913
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I'm making it, so there's basically three moves.

914
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Now, you, you are going to apply them throughout that flight.

915
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
But you're not going to come up with like,

916
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
oh, man, I'm going to come up with some crazy thing

917
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
that's never seen before.

918
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
It, it doesn't work.

919
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And it actually makes it worse for you.

920
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So if, if you're mounted, and I'm trying to get you off,

921
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I just am flailing right,

922
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I roll over on my stomach or do some.

923
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
As the offenders, like, dude, you're not helping.

924
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Here, go, just do a.

925
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
You can really, the best thing you can do is just do a break.

926
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
That's right.

927
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Best thing you can do.

928
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Best thing you do is do a break.

929
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And then do a ditch.

930
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Yeah, and then do another break.

931
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Yep.

932
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And then do another ditch.

933
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Yep.

934
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Yeah. You, you only out of moves, by the way, the three moves.

935
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Yeah, and, and, and listen,

936
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
sometimes you can't do a ditch.

937
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
If you're too close to the ground, the ditch isn't an option.

938
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It's not available to you.

939
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Mm-hmm.

940
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
If you do it, you will die.

941
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Period.

942
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
So it is not in your repertoire.

943
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
How much do you use a change of pace, like in basketball,

944
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
you know, when you're dribbling down the court, you change pace, you go,

945
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
you, you're going fast, then you slow down for second, then you go fast again.

946
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Is there any of that?

947
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Yeah, not really.

948
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Is that because it's too hard to control the rate of speed of the aircraft in a short enough time

949
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
that it will make them react in a proper way?

950
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yeah, I think that's, that's a big part of it.

951
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And, and, and, so getting from fast to slow is pretty easy.

952
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Getting from slow to fast is harder.

953
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And so the change of pace to me is more about,

954
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I'm going to, I'm going to try to get some air speed back.

955
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Let's say I'm going to tune to knots, and I'd love to be forging knots.

956
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I can't just go from 200 to 400.

957
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So I'm going to go to 220.

958
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
And that may take a second.

959
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And I'm going to steal that 20 knots.

960
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And then we're going to swirl around a little bit, and then I'm going to see an opportunity

961
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
like, oh, oh, oh, oh, juggle gave me a little bit of room here.

962
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I'm going to go from 220 to 250, and that'll be three seconds.

963
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Boom, I got it.

964
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And I'm going to steal that and then I'm going to get to fit, and I'm going to,

965
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
so that change of pace is me trying to steal.

966
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
But if you ever apply so much pressure to me effectively that I can't do that,

967
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I don't get that speed back.

968
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And you can actually find aggressive enough airplane to keep me from doing that.

969
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
That I don't get to just steal that, that to date the pace.

970
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
So the pace of that of changing air speeds, it comes in a pretty big cost.

971
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And so you have to do it really intelligently when you do that,

972
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
and steal it every chance you get.

973
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
What about when Dan was talking about going vertical?

974
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Yeah.

975
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
So there's a really unique thing that they discovered at top,

976
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
and when they talked about the egg about this vertical fight,

977
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000
is the way your airplane maneuvers vertically going from pointed up,

978
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
so pointed high to low, is a your airplane is typically very slow at the top of a loop,

979
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
which makes sense.

980
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
You lose an energy to get up there, so the slow reward, the smaller radius is.

981
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000
So the tighter you can turn, but you also have something we call God's G.

982
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
So it is pulling you back towards the ground.

983
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
So the radius of your turn at the top of a loop is way smaller than your radius at the bottom of a loop.

984
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Because you're fighting against G going from low to high,

985
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
G is helping you going from high to low.

986
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
So if there's ever a place where you're above someone,

987
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and then below you, and all the other factors are relatively even,

988
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
your turn at the top is better than his turn at the bottom,

989
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
and it's typically a more advantageous place to be.

990
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And so the key would be is, how can I maneuver to a place where I can climb above you without putting myself at risk to your weapons,

991
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and then maneuver above you, and take advantage of that free G force that's available to me going from high to low,

992
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
where you're fighting against that and you're losing it, going from low to high,

993
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
and that's kind of the goal of that vertical fight that he described.

994
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
So is that something that you would do?

995
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Yeah, I mean that's something you could do.

996
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
So he brought up an interesting thing, and you mentioned this with boi-ty.

997
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I think the way you said it was exactly right man,

998
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:43.000
so F-18, F-16, F-15, MIG-29, SC-27, all these airplanes in this generational world that I was in at top,

999
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
going to during that time, they're all pretty good.

1000
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And you know what?

1001
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
B-F-16 is a little bit faster than an F-18.

1002
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But the F-15's got a little bit better turn race, and it's no different than,

1003
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
hey, maybe you're stronger than echo.

1004
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:05.000
But echo's got you know a little bit of flexibility, and maybe you've got some capacity that he doesn't,

1005
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
but none of that is exclusive, I mean, you don't get to just beat him because you're stronger,

1006
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
because he can counter that strength that you have with something that maybe you don't have.

1007
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
So on paper, all these airplanes have different strengths and weaknesses,

1008
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
but none of them are so absolute that you get to just beat me because your machine is better than me.

1009
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
It's always, always, always comes out of the pilot.

1010
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Depending on who, what type of plane I'm flying against, that vertical move isn't awesome move.

1011
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Some airplanes, it's the last thing I want to do, so I won't go up there at all.

1012
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:44.000
When Boyd comes to his conclusion, wasn't our aircraft in Korea worse than the other aircraft?

1013
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
In most ways, yes, most of the ways, and how was that not just a red flag that, hey,

1014
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
actually it depends on what the pilot does.

1015
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Well, in Boyd's defense, Boyd kind of understood that.

1016
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Boyd had the way Boyd explained it when he talked about EM theory that Dan was talking about.

1017
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
He explained it in a somewhat of a different way.

1018
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
He also evolved into a different airplane, the Phantom, but Boyd, make no mistake.

1019
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Boyd understood that just because your machine turned faster, climbed higher, didn't mean you're going to win.

1020
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Boyd understood that without a doubt.

1021
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Because we know that there's other areas that we're stronger in.

1022
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Other areas that we're stronger in, and I can actually assess in real time, how well you're performing your aircraft.

1023
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So I can observe, go, hey, your airplane can actually do this, but you're not making it do that.

1024
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
So guess what? You're essentially giving that to me.

1025
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
So the strength on paper that says, you know, you can jump this high.

1026
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Well, in theory you should have that extra three, that three four inches that you can jump it I can't, but you're not jumping that high.

1027
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.000
And I can see that and assess that, and I'm going to take that from you, and I'm going to make that your advantage is no longer your advantage.

1028
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So how does Boyd then get to, hey, don't fight a, uh, meag with a, at four phantom?

1029
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I mean, the way I perceive that is a failure to recognize a, how much training matters,

1030
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:21.000
how much, how critical it is to be able to observe all these tiny little nuanced things that by themselves may not appear to be a big deal.

1031
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
But if I find 20 of them in a fight and I put them all together, it's a massive advantage.

1032
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And what, what, what science says an airplane can do isn't the limiting factor.

1033
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Now there are some limits, but when you build an EM diagram, you don't account for Dan Petters and Stelslide.

1034
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Sound in the EM diagram. It's not in the science because the science says the airplane is no longer flying.

1035
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
And these guys are like, yeah, that may be true, but watch this.

1036
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I can go pure vertical to my tail of their planes slides back down.

1037
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I can pitch it around with my rudder, none of that is in the diagram, and I can make my airplane do something the paper says it can't.

1038
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And when I do to you, you will not know how to react, and I'm going to kill you.

1039
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:11.000
So that combination of the mentality in the mindset with the recognition that a fight is 20 things piece together.

1040
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And all of them together is how you get to the outcome is why top gun is what top gun is.

1041
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:30.000
If I'm looking at that, like I just don't understand how I don't figure out that I can beat a Meg with an F4.

1042
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
If I know, well, let me take one step further.

1043
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000
How do the engineers not know this? How the engineers not say, hey, here's what you can do with one of these aircraft.

1044
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:52.000
In that era, I think the way Dan yet describes it is, they didn't have the right mentality.

1045
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
These airplanes were not even designed to be dog fighters.

1046
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
They were convinced that that era was over.

1047
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:09.000
That's kind of like guys like in the Air Force guys like Robin Oles or such legends, because in the face of an entire industry and in the face of an entire era of

1048
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:19.000
the military mindset, he recognized that the thing that makes us better is how well we train and how aggressive we are with our machines.

1049
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Not what you tell me the machine can do.

1050
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And that's why guys like Yank and the do's that sort of top gun and guys like the Robin Oles of the world.

1051
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:34.000
That's why those guys are legendary because they fought against a trend that said this is a machine that's not designed to turn.

1052
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
If you turn with a Meg you're going to lose.

1053
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
It's like, well, we're turn with Meg's and I'm not going to lose.

1054
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
So I'm going to figure this thing out and some guys did and that was the origin of top gun.

1055
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Is whenever anyone else saying you can't do this, he said, not only can we we have to.

1056
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And that's pretty cool.

1057
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.000
The other I'm just thinking of of the test pilots, right?

1058
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Because those guys are taking these birds and the engineers are saying it can do XYZ and they're taking it way beyond those limitations.

1059
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Especially in that era.

1060
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
That's what I'm saying.

1061
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Yeah.

1062
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Yeah.

1063
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Because nowadays maybe with commute computer modeling in AI, you can maybe get a little closer.

1064
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
But back then it was like, okay, here's the bird.

1065
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Here's what we think you can do.

1066
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
What do you got?

1067
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Dude, those guys back then in the Yager era.

1068
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Those guys would get in the airplanes and even know if they were going to fly.

1069
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I mean, what they knew on paper versus what was going to happen.

1070
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
There was a big gap there.

1071
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Those test pilots of that generation, you know, that right stuff generation.

1072
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And I mean, they were doing crazy things and having the discoveries they made and what they were able to do.

1073
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Now, there is so much more modeling, so much more science behind it that look,

1074
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
they're still a community out there.

1075
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
They're doing incredible things.

1076
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
But typically when you strap on an airplane, you have a pretty good idea of how it's going to perform and how it's going to behave.

1077
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
No one knew like what they were dealing with in that era.

1078
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
How did you feel when you when you were flying the F-22 and the F-35?

1079
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
How much were you saying, hey, you guys told me XYZ, let me give you the real numbers over here.

1080
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
From from good deal.

1081
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Yeah.

1082
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Well, that that was kind of my life in the Raptor.

1083
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I was an operational test pilot.

1084
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
So, not a developmental guy.

1085
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
That's that, you know, there's developmental tests, which is literally they built it and they wanted to go see it this same works.

1086
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Our job is once they figured out the machine work, which is the Raptor.

1087
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Operational test pilots go out there and figure out how to use this thing.

1088
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And operationally tested in operationally relevant environments.

1089
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
So, not the science, but the operational piece of it.

1090
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
And you look, you had to know the science, you had to know what the airplane could do mechanically.

1091
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
But the coolest thing about being an operational pilot was taking an airplane like a Raptor.

1092
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And then finding everything you didn't like about it.

1093
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Everything you thought was wrong about it.

1094
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Everything that the science said was good, but you knew wouldn't work in combat.

1095
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And we got to identify and fix those things.

1096
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And that was awesome.

1097
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Because you took this awesome machine and put it in relevant operational scenarios.

1098
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And you beat the crap out of it to see how it would do.

1099
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Give me an example unclassified of, like, hey, you took your Raptor out and you said, you know what?

1100
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
You need to make some adjustments over here.

1101
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And I mean, I know the acquisition systems in the militaries like crazy.

1102
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Would you get real time fixes on these birds?

1103
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Yeah, someone would get pretty quick.

1104
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
You know, we had to do a lot of prioritizing execute back when we're doing operational tests.

1105
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So we'd get this airplane it have.

1106
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
We'd have this list of 30 or 40 things in this tracker of all the things wrong with it.

1107
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And oftentimes what we thought was the number one problem would take the longest and cost the most money.

1108
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:41.000
But problem 5, 6 and 7 combined were less than problem one and they could fix it in a matter of days.

1109
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And so we hit problem 5, 6 and 7 and got really quick turn around and made a ton of incremental changes that over time over two, three,

1110
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
and we had to make a couple of more of your period completely changed the capabilities of the airplane.

1111
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
We didn't always get everything we wanted, we didn't always get all the money we needed and we don't always have time to make all the fixes.

1112
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:06.000
But we had a really cool feedback loop with the engineers to fix the things that we said were important and make it fix it really fast.

1113
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Okay, I don't run you back to top gone.

1114
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
All right, you're putting me through training.

1115
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Yep.

1116
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And you're judging echo and me.

1117
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And you get your first lock up with both of us. You do your little assessment.

1118
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
What?

1119
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Prioritize next.

1120
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000
What's the number one differentiator between echoes?

1121
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Top line capabilities.

1122
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So you're going to get echo.

1123
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Your new goal is just to train echo and train me to be as good as we possibly can get.

1124
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
What is the quality that you're like,

1125
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Oh, echo's good at this.

1126
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:52.000
He's going to be able to excel in in this and he's going to do a little better better than jockel because I can see jockel is kind of lagging in his ability to.

1127
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
X.

1128
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Yeah.

1129
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I would say recall.

1130
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
From, because remember, I'm teaching an instructor.

1131
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I'm teaching a teacher here.

1132
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
My job is to make you an echo teacher.

1133
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Mm-hmm.

1134
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
In this, not just how to find the airplane, but how to teach flying the airplane is recall.

1135
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Can you tell me what happened?

1136
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
All the things that happened.

1137
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And recall is connected very closely to something we call situational awareness.

1138
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So do you really know all the things that are going out there?

1139
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
In three dimensional space with all the airplanes in real time.

1140
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000
The more you can process what's happening, the more you can recall what's happening,

1141
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
the better you're going to be able to teach this and understand what actually is going on.

1142
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:39.000
You could be really good in an airplane and maybe a little bit better than him just pure moving that machine around.

1143
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
But if you don't really know what's happening around you the way that he does, eventually he's going to out, he's going to outperform you.

1144
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000
So it sounds like I need to have the ability to detach.

1145
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I would agree with that.

1146
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Did you identify that while you were in the, in top going in the Marine Corps?

1147
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Did you ever identify like, hey, oh, I can see this guy.

1148
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
It's all wrapped up.

1149
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Doesn't know what's happening.

1150
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
What will this guy over here?

1151
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000
He's, you know, he separates his brain from his body and what's happening and he can see the big picture.

1152
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Yeah.

1153
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I mean, we, what did you call it?

1154
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
We used the situational illness.

1155
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Well, the term of situational illness when people lost situational illness or no longer did what you just described,

1156
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
we just call it, we'd say, looking through the soda straw.

1157
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I mean, which is very similar to, you know, we, I think you guys use a phrase front sight.

1158
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Well, front sight focus isn't the best because front sight focus is a positive thing because you're doing it in order to aim it.

1159
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
We go on, we say you're, your target fixating.

1160
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.000
You're, you say, you know, you're staring down the scope of your weapon, which that is exactly what you're talking about.

1161
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
You're looking at it through a straw.

1162
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Same thing.

1163
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Yeah.

1164
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And I think it's just, just, just, same, different phrase, same exact meaning.

1165
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000
What that typically meant is that echo or you whoever's looking through the soda straw would just start to stare one piece of information.

1166
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And in airplane, you got a whole bunch of things going on inside and outside of the airplane,

1167
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
plus you're hearing things.

1168
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So you've got always different inputs.

1169
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And I could tell when you are, or echoes looking through the soda straw without even seeing you because I'll say something to you and you either won't respond.

1170
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
You know, you'll respond really late. You'll do something wrong.

1171
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
You know, I hate this.

1172
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I hate this. You know, I hate this because I know it's on video, right?

1173
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
It's on video like you're like, oh, here's me calling you.

1174
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
You know, here's me calling you again. Here's me calling you again.

1175
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And I'm going, oh, yeah.

1176
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I know I was not detached.

1177
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
It's crazy. What do you tell me? So we get back. I was staring through the soda straw.

1178
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.000
What do you tell me? What, what, what's your debrief and then what's your, what's your, what's your corrective measures that you're going to give me?

1179
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
When you're looking through the soda straw.

1180
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Yep. So the debrief down with the flight and looking through the soda straw.

1181
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I didn't respond to your calls.

1182
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I missed a bunch of stuff. What do you tell me?

1183
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
So the way I, I'm going to have a pretty good idea in the while we're flying around that you're doing that.

1184
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And I'm going to know because your missing calls.

1185
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
You're not going the way to suppose you're not hearing things.

1186
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.000
But when we get back, the first time I'm going to do is say, hey, tell me what happened on that flight. Why don't you just draw it out for me?

1187
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Just run me through what you saw.

1188
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And that is the standard debrief. The first thing we do is recreate the flight.

1189
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And you get a marker. You get up and front of the flight. You get red pens and blue pens.

1190
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
You get good guys and bad guys.

1191
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
And you just need to draw it.

1192
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
We started here. We went here. You started here and, and that may be two airplanes.

1193
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
That may be 16 airplanes.

1194
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
But I'm going to need you to just show me your recall.

1195
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And that's going to be my first real indicator other than me watching in real time that you've missed some things.

1196
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And so after you draw it up and just say, this is what happened.

1197
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Then we're going to put up the tapes.

1198
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
So before I get into your, and say, hey, you missed this and missed that.

1199
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
What I really am going to do is give you a little bit of a chance to now watch the tape and go,

1200
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Oh, hang on. Stop tape for a second.

1201
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I drew that we went off to the north and turned here with this group.

1202
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
But I'm watching the tape.

1203
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Hey, that didn't happen. Now eyes in a shark-iron. Okay, that's a really good sign.

1204
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Jockel maybe wasn't all together there.

1205
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
But Jockel can self-assess. He's detached in the debrief and he's, he's self-aware.

1206
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
The likelihood that you're going to go out and get better on the next fight is actually really high.

1207
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
And I don't need to give you a ton of debrief. And I might reinforce and go, hey, that's a good catch man.

1208
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Listen for the audio on the next call.

1209
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Did you hear the call that there was a maneuver in the north and he's like, no, man.

1210
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Jockel says he missed it. Okay, these are all good things.

1211
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.000
If you draw it up, clear your missing things. You run through the entire tape and don't make the connection.

1212
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Now you and I need to start back over.

1213
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Then I need to draw what's up there and then I'm going to put some big circles in the boring go, hey,

1214
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
we're going to really analyze this engagement here and I'm going to play the tape and go, okay, stop, what do you see?

1215
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Where's this airplane?

1216
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Would you depict it? I'm going to show you that you missed something.

1217
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000
And I'm going to have to kind of run through that whole thing in detail with all this data to show what happened.

1218
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
To try to get you to realize that you're missing things and the way I'm going to tell you moving forward is

1219
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000
You are more likely to start to lose situational awareness after we get past to this phase.

1220
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000
So once the first turn happens, you tend to get two connected or two engaged or two,

1221
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Boresighted on this thing.

1222
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
And I can start to figure out what triggers you to get emotional, what triggers you to get,

1223
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000
what triggers you to look at the soda straw and the start to call is out for you and get you to think about it

1224
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
before we go do it and then see how well you can adapt to that.

1225
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.000
How well can you actually pull yourself out of that detached and we'll go do that again and see what you're doing the next one.

1226
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:29.000
So I, you know, because you're not in an airplane because you're, you know, in a fake urban environment or you're out in the desert.

1227
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Like this is a conversation I had more times than I can count with a young leader.

1228
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Hey man, you're, you're all caught up in this. Here's what you need to do. You need to put your weapon and high port.

1229
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
You need to take a step back off the line and you need to turn your head and look around.

1230
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Yeah. So it seems like that is a clearer form of instruction.

1231
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:56.000
It's an actual thing that you can do because it's a different environment.

1232
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Is there anything that you could give them more directly to get them to take a step back.

1233
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Put their head on this level, look around to attach. Is there anything better that you could tell them.

1234
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I see what you're doing with, hey, here's all the things you missed and I did that too.

1235
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I would do it with my little pocket recorder and everything.

1236
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:23.000
We had these laser guns. We had these laser tag system and they had little GPS's on them and those little GPS's would track where you are.

1237
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And then we could replay the whole thing on Google Earth and these guys would have no idea.

1238
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I didn't know my element was over there. I didn't know that's going to end.

1239
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
So that's the same thing. That's the same technique of listening, man.

1240
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:41.000
You didn't know the cell and was over here. You didn't know that there are soldiers already left the building and you didn't see where you didn't know the stuff was going on.

1241
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
And they go, oh, yeah, I need to pull back.

1242
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
But then I'd say, listen, man, you need to get off your gun.

1243
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
You need to get it a high port. You need to start looking around.

1244
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
You need to start paying attention to what's going on big picture.

1245
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Is there any instruction?

1246
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Like that, while I'm flying at an F-18, it's pretty uncommon that in the middle of a training flight that eyes an instructor.

1247
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And we're going to give you cues to do the things that you're supposed to do.

1248
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
There are a few exceptions.

1249
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
But I mean, I could do it after the off.

1250
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I mean, this is always, this is always like, hey, I'm right there.

1251
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I'm after the off-m going bro. Oh, you can't let this happen.

1252
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Here's what you need to do.

1253
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Oh, all the time, all the time. And that's sort of the beauty of the tapes.

1254
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:37.000
You know, one of the crazy things is the way that the tape machines used to run before is that the cameras would be kind of connected to the canopy and record the screen.

1255
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
And then the reflection of the screen, you could see the pilot's head.

1256
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Literally see his head.

1257
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And I go, hey, listen, every time we're approaching a murder than 10 miles, I can see you staring at this display.

1258
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
At 10 miles. So what I want you to think on this, but every time you get in the reason 10 miles is important is that,

1259
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
we had a radio call that would come in and say, somebody would say 10 miles.

1260
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
And he wouldn't be hearing that call.

1261
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
10 miles is the call that's telling everybody, start looking outside,

1262
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
start literally looking up and out so you can stop looking your screen to start finding the actual airplane itself.

1263
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Hey, I want you. I want you to give the 10 mile call.

1264
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:18.000
You're going to be the 10 mile call today and get that guy to, and I would say, this is a way to get you out of the cockpit and up and out.

1265
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And we would probably had a hundred different tricks and hundred different ways to give a guy something to think about, hey,

1266
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:32.000
this is where you get wrapped up. And this is a tool and a technique that you can use to take yourself out of being too attached and to detach.

1267
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Ten miles call is an awesome way to do that.

1268
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
In Engage calls and awesome way to do that.

1269
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Anything that you could help with that guy and the debrief because these are good guys.

1270
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
These are guys you built really strong.

1271
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Ten weeks is a long time to share a lot of spare, very little space. Somebody, you got to know these students really, really well.

1272
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
You could have really on a straightforward conversations. You could build really good relationships.

1273
01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:03.000
They would come around Saturdays. You'd barbecue and you just talk fine and you could tell them all the things and you wanted them to succeed and you would give them everything you could to help them get better.

1274
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
What did you call this recall?

1275
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Recall.

1276
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Can you tell me what happened?

1277
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Yeah.

1278
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Which is the massive indicator for I'm detached and I'm actually paying attention to everything that's going on.

1279
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.000
100% if you are not detached, you will not, you won't know what's happening other than maybe what's happening inside your cockpit.

1280
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But Topkin isn't about disunion or a plan that's you leading a formation of 16 plans.

1281
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000
And you need to know what's going on with all those 16 plans.

1282
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
No different. And I'm not saying that you have to know every step that they're taking every turn of their mind.

1283
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
You know, there are times that you were detached from your task and they're maneuvering.

1284
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
But you know what's happening. These guys are shifting to this building. These guys are heading up to the roof.

1285
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000
These guys are bogged down. There's a problem over here. Hey, I need to now pull some resource over here because there's no resistance over here.

1286
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
And these guys are kind of doing nothing and shift them up and that you can

1287
01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Randage your task unit in real time and have a really good idea of what's going on with all of them without being with any of them.

1288
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And in the exact same way that's completely trainable.

1289
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Does this athletic, how much does athletic ability play role?

1290
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:20.000
You know, I don't know if anybody is ever that I've ever seen like the connection between that specifically.

1291
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.000
But if you're a good athlete, you're probably a good pilot.

1292
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And if you, you're a good pilot, you were probably a good athlete.

1293
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
And we used to say all the time that the joke would be when people are asking,

1294
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I come to Top Gun and the joke would be as hey, can you throw a football?

1295
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
That's the question we'd ask. And it was a little bit tongue and cheek because I don't really care if you can throw a football.

1296
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
But it was the connection between those those two things. And it doesn't mean you had to be a superstar athlete.

1297
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:54.000
But you had to be athletic. It's physical. It's physical. You had to be athletic. You had to be physical. You had to be, you had to not be afraid of conflict.

1298
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And did I care if you were the captain of your football team and heighten?

1299
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Nobody cared about that stuff. But there was an absolute connection between being athletic and liking athletic competition and being good in the airplane.

1300
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:14.000
How about, um, how about eyesight, which I know back in the day was like the component Chuck Yager, you know, could like PID,

1301
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yeah, bogeys, just so before anyone is even close to seeing them.

1302
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Same thing. I know you, I know you have really good eyes.

1303
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And I did it the time I had, I had really uniquely good eyesight. I mean, I was picking off, uh, I could see things in the eye chart that were really good.

1304
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Back and certainly back in the day that was everything because the only resource they had to find the enemy was their eyeballs.

1305
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:47.000
But I would tell you that it's still really important. I sat was really important. Now, one of the major discoveries that the military came up with in recent decades was that

1306
01:31:47.000 --> 01:32:00.000
they would let you wear glasses. So, you know, if you didn't have good eyesight, they would let you fix it. But eyesight was really critical because there's a phase in every fight that transitions from the systems to the visual.

1307
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:11.000
And that transition was really hard. It's really hard to look at your screen and then look up and try to account for where that person is in space, clouds and all sorts of different things.

1308
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And so the sooner you could see that with your eyes, the better, you know, technology has helped with that a bunch. There's cues now, little boxes and you can do that.

1309
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:30.000
I sat still important. It's not as important as it was before, but it was something that if you had, if you had good eyes and could determine what's going on at farther in just you haven't had an advantage.

1310
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.000
How much does luck play a role?

1311
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:49.000
It does. I'm a beneficiary of a ton of good luck. You know, all through my entire life. You know, and there's a bunch of cliches and catch phrases about what luck really is.

1312
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Luck by itself would never, would never be enough. Just getting lucky and, you know, you'd come back and then man, we got lucky on that one.

1313
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:07.000
But typically the lucky things that worked out, you could almost always connect it to a whole bunch of things you did right to get to the point where something is just worked out in your favor.

1314
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:18.000
So yeah, to guys get lucky, then I get lucky all the time, but rarely was that by itself an attribute or a circumstance that was very reliable.

1315
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Can you utilize, okay, it's so in Gigiitsu and really in any endeavor, you can, you can wear someone out, like in Gigiitsu, you call it gassing.

1316
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I would imagine that that is a strategy that you would have, hey, I've got a bigger gas tank than you, or I can make you do the maneuvers that are going to burn more gas.

1317
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Is that a thing?

1318
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Really, no, it's totally, the mid 29 was notoriously bad on gas notoriously, you know, the next worst airplane for gases.

1319
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
F-18.

1320
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:58.000
The F-18. So we knew going into our fights that were always at a disadvantage and when bigger planes showed up like we talked about the S-27, that thing had a ton of gas.

1321
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.000
It's a hundred percent of consideration, a hundred percent, and you think about it all the time.

1322
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Not to mention, in naval aviation, you got to go back to the ship. You're always managing your gas. You had enough, yet had enough gas to go back and get back aboard the ship, not some giant airport with, you know, 18,000 feet of runway.

1323
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.000
You had to go back and land aboard the carrier, and that was a gas critical endeavor.

1324
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
How many carrier landings do you have?

1325
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Maybe 450.

1326
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:37.000
It seems like a lot, it's not that much compared, you know, they're a carrier guys out there with 8,900 landing, some close to 1,000.

1327
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
So it seems like a lot, but there's plenty of guys with a lot more than me.

1328
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Did you ever, were you ever comfortable with it?

1329
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I got comfortable during the day for sure.

1330
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
To be totally honest, I never got comfortable with the night landings.

1331
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Never got to a, got that comfortable. When I did Afghanistan right after 9, 11, we were on the, we were the night carrier.

1332
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
So all of our operations for about six months were at night.

1333
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Just by pure, just doing it every single day, it got a lot better.

1334
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:18.000
But the night landing was always in the back of your mind. It was always something to kind of contend with psychologically that the you knew it was out there.

1335
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.000
This is the first time reading a dance book.

1336
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Look, I've been told a thousand times, a post-it stamp, and all these other things, and it's so hard, it's the hardest thing, and blah, blah, blah.

1337
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:40.000
This book was the first time I really said to myself, yeah, it has got to be a gut check every single time.

1338
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Yeah, look, I've done a decent amount of flying, a bunch of different airplanes.

1339
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I got to fly with all the services. A night carrier landing.

1340
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000
There's really nothing else like it, and it is a gut check.

1341
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And it's a gut check every single time no matter how many you've done.

1342
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I got well over a hundred night landings, which on a ratio of day to night, like that's a lot of night landing.

1343
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:09.000
So it's a habit of being on a night carrier, which most deployments, you don't spend the entire deployment of night, and I just happen to be on one of those.

1344
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:23.000
It is, it's a gut check for everybody, the pilot, the flight deck, the LSO, the ship, the night page on a ship, on a aircraft currency, there is nothing in aviation like it, and it is a gut check for everybody.

1345
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And it never gets better, and never gets easier.

1346
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
So, talk me through a little night carrier landing.

1347
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I will.

1348
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Yeah, night carrier landing is kind of the great equalizer in naval aviation.

1349
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
That's a thing that's out there that every fighter pilot is going to have to do.

1350
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:50.000
And no matter what has gone on in your mission, whether it's just a straight-up, just super simple training mission, you could have been by yourself just flying around,

1351
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000
or you just did six hours in Iraq or Afghanistan, or somewhere else.

1352
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
You're going to come back and you're going to land aboard the ship.

1353
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And no matter what you've got going on that, that always sits in the back of your mind.

1354
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:15.000
You've got to plan for it, you've got to count for it, you've got to manage your fuel for it, and you've got to recognize that more than likely, the hardest part of your flight, no matter what you're doing, more often than not, it's going to be the last thing you do.

1355
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:22.000
When you're coming back to the field, and you know you're coming back to the Marine Corps, station, Miramar, or wherever, you're not even thinking about the landing.

1356
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
That's just a no-brainer.

1357
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Landing a regular plane on a regular runway, most of the time, is just not hard. And it's certainly not something you're going to sweat like, man, I hope I can land this time.

1358
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
It's just not something you think about.

1359
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.000
So once you figure out a land and airplane like an F-18, and a regular runway, you just don't really think about it too much.

1360
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Carriers totally different.

1361
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:51.000
And so it's something you have to think about, you've got to compartmentalize, you've got to detach from it, but you can't ignore that it's out there either.

1362
01:37:51.000 --> 01:38:02.000
So you've got to think about your fuel, you've got to think about your wingmen, you've got to think about the other 20 airplanes that are going to be landing on the ship at the same time as you, and the coordination goes along with that.

1363
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:15.000
And this is a huge choreography that you, the ship, and the other airplanes have to manage and coordinate, and typically, typically, the goal is to do it either no-com or min-com.

1364
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:25.000
There's very little talking going on in this coordination. You might get to sign an altitude, and you might get to sign what's called a push time when you commence your approach.

1365
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And that may be all the talking you get up until the time that you're about to land.

1366
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000
So you're kind of alone, yourself contained, and you've got to manage all these things.

1367
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So night landings are, look man, they're legit, and they never get easy, they never get comfortable.

1368
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.000
The idea, I'm sad this before, right? When people say hey, what makes the seals good?

1369
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Well, I think the thing that makes the seals good is that we have to work in the water, and the water is the same thing.

1370
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000
It's an equalizer every time you're in the water, you don't even end a me to kill you in your in the water.

1371
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
You can, the water itself can kill you.

1372
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:12.000
When you have to do a mission, over the beach, swim in, you know, it's, you're weapons covered in sand.

1373
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Your radio is get flooded. There's all those, there's just all these things that happen.

1374
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Doing a direct action mission from home, these compared to doing a direct action mission that you swim over the beach.

1375
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
It's not even comparable.

1376
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.000
You could train, you know, you could take a high school football team.

1377
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:40.000
And you could train those guys in three or four days to do a pretty decent job doing a direct action mission.

1378
01:39:40.000 --> 01:40:00.000
And they, they'd be able to pull it off to get them to be able to come over to launch from a ship and take Zodiacs over the beach and get on the beach and change out into their new gear and you, you, you need months.

1379
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.000
You need months, if not longer, you need, you need six months and you'd have a washout rate.

1380
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
You'd have people that are not capable because it look on a football team.

1381
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
You know, how many people on a football team? The whole team?

1382
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
What, high school? Yeah. Let's go college.

1383
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
100, 105.

1384
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
105.

1385
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Totally.

1386
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Okay. So 105 that are going to train to do a land direct action mission.

1387
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
You're going to have five or six that can't do it.

1388
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
They're, they're, they got some issue. They're not safe. They're just not with it.

1389
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Whatever, whatever the case may be. You put them in the water and you start swimming over the beach.

1390
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000
You're looking at your, you're losing 50% of those guys.

1391
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Maybe 70% of those guys that are just, they can't.

1392
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
They're not good enough swimmers. They're not good enough, you know, in the water. They're not comfortable.

1393
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
They're, they're cold.

1394
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Are there so many things?

1395
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
That right there is the difference.

1396
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
And when I start thinking about landing on aircraft carriers,

1397
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:06.000
it's got to be somewhat similar because the weather, you're landing on a thing that is moving.

1398
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Yeah.

1399
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Dude, it's, that's so true, man.

1400
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I mean, I, I think the thing about the water is when you're operating around the water.

1401
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
You can never, you can't take a time out. You can't pause.

1402
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
You can't just stop for a minute.

1403
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Look, if I'm coming back to Miramar and there's a problem in the Miramar,

1404
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I got 10 other airports within 30 minutes that I can go to.

1405
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I can go back over to you, but where the weather's always perfect.

1406
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I can go to North Island. I can go to LA.

1407
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I've got so many different options.

1408
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:43.000
And the, the water never lets you pause.

1409
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000
You cannot pause. You can't just wait.

1410
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
You can't just decide not to do it.

1411
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000
There's no divert. That's just down the road.

1412
01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:02.000
This, this, this awesome seal captain who is of prior marine and, and, and, and, and a, and a little bit of a rebellious guy.

1413
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
He gave a speech that I was at.

1414
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And I don't even want to give any details about where is that, what was it about?

1415
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:15.000
But he, he was making a dig at some of the other personnel that, that he was working with at the time.

1416
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
And we, he said, it was a great speech.

1417
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
He was saying, look, where in the Navy.

1418
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
And what's different about the Navy is, we come from ships.

1419
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
And on a ship.

1420
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000
You don't have any choice, but to fight.

1421
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
There is no retreat on a ship.

1422
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Those are our routes.

1423
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Now, look, he took the most absolutely romantic view that a, that, that, a, that, a, the most heroic view that a human could ever take about tying,

1424
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.000
you know, the modern Navy and, and, especially the seal teams to rooting our keracys,

1425
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.40
and especially the seal teams to rooting our character

1426
01:42:48.40 --> 01:42:51.36
in the fact that on a ship, there is no retreat,

1427
01:42:51.36 --> 01:42:54.16
there is no surrender if the ship goes down,

1428
01:42:54.16 --> 01:42:57.08
we all die, that's our attitude.

1429
01:42:57.08 --> 01:42:59.40
I mean, you wanna talk about a young Jacob it,

1430
01:42:59.40 --> 01:43:01.36
getting pumped up, but fire.

1431
01:43:01.36 --> 01:43:04.96
That's what I'm thinking right now is when you're at sea,

1432
01:43:04.96 --> 01:43:07.48
you can either land on this carrier,

1433
01:43:07.48 --> 01:43:08.96
or you can land on this carrier.

1434
01:43:08.96 --> 01:43:10.12
That's it, I mean, that's it.

1435
01:43:10.12 --> 01:43:11.36
There is no other options.

1436
01:43:11.36 --> 01:43:12.96
Yeah, and if you got a problem,

1437
01:43:12.96 --> 01:43:17.04
or you're running low on gas, or you've got a mechanical issue

1438
01:43:17.04 --> 01:43:19.52
that's gonna create some problems for you,

1439
01:43:19.52 --> 01:43:21.48
you're going back to the ship.

1440
01:43:21.48 --> 01:43:23.92
I mean, if you take your seals and you load them up

1441
01:43:23.92 --> 01:43:27.40
into boats and you jump off the bigger ship to go do

1442
01:43:27.40 --> 01:43:29.36
some sort of insertion, and the weather is so bad

1443
01:43:29.36 --> 01:43:30.88
and the environment is so bad, and then everything's like,

1444
01:43:30.88 --> 01:43:32.08
hey, we can't do this training exercise.

1445
01:43:32.08 --> 01:43:32.92
It's not safe.

1446
01:43:32.92 --> 01:43:34.60
The training exercise is canceled.

1447
01:43:34.60 --> 01:43:35.44
What do you have to do?

1448
01:43:35.44 --> 01:43:38.52
Yeah, we gotta go drive those boats into the well-deck

1449
01:43:38.52 --> 01:43:42.32
of the ship in 12 foot seas, which is a complete nightmare.

1450
01:43:42.32 --> 01:43:44.76
You're not into parking lot, thinking this is a bad idea.

1451
01:43:44.76 --> 01:43:47.48
We can't do this, and the weather is not gonna allow

1452
01:43:47.48 --> 01:43:49.04
this training mission to happen.

1453
01:43:49.04 --> 01:43:51.92
Believe me, we would say, you know what?

1454
01:43:51.92 --> 01:43:53.04
Let's just go totally.

1455
01:43:53.04 --> 01:43:54.20
It's easy than training.

1456
01:43:54.20 --> 01:43:55.04
Back in the day.

1457
01:43:55.04 --> 01:43:55.88
Yeah, yeah.

1458
01:43:55.88 --> 01:43:58.36
Yeah, and so the thing about carrier landings

1459
01:43:58.36 --> 01:44:02.52
is there's really, there's no training

1460
01:44:02.52 --> 01:44:03.72
and there's no real life.

1461
01:44:03.72 --> 01:44:07.04
It's just real life all the time.

1462
01:44:07.04 --> 01:44:11.88
And there's another thing, there's a psychological component

1463
01:44:11.88 --> 01:44:16.08
about the ship that kind of, it reminds you

1464
01:44:16.08 --> 01:44:18.04
what it is every time.

1465
01:44:18.04 --> 01:44:20.48
So you get, you're coming back, you may be over the beach

1466
01:44:20.48 --> 01:44:23.32
and you've done a long mission, or it doesn't matter

1467
01:44:23.32 --> 01:44:24.16
what you're doing.

1468
01:44:24.16 --> 01:44:26.08
At some point, you end up what's called the stack.

1469
01:44:26.08 --> 01:44:29.000
And all the stack is, is about 15, 20 miles from the boat

1470
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.56
at every altitude, you know, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000,

1471
01:44:31.56 --> 01:44:33.80
there's an airplane in every altitude.

1472
01:44:33.80 --> 01:44:36.32
And they just stack them up from five up to however many

1473
01:44:36.32 --> 01:44:38.52
there are up to 20,000 feet, or if there's 15,000,

1474
01:44:38.52 --> 01:44:39.60
something like that.

1475
01:44:39.60 --> 01:44:41.72
And you just sit in the stack.

1476
01:44:41.72 --> 01:44:44.04
And you've got your gas, and somebody will come up

1477
01:44:44.04 --> 01:44:47.36
and then they'll go, hey, you know, aircraft 204,

1478
01:44:47.36 --> 01:44:50.36
your push time is time 1015.

1479
01:44:50.36 --> 01:44:51.20
Roger that.

1480
01:44:51.20 --> 01:44:52.52
That's the only call you're gonna get.

1481
01:44:52.52 --> 01:44:56.28
So I'm at 9,000 feet, I look at my watch, or I look at the clock.

1482
01:44:56.28 --> 01:44:59.68
And I am now wait until 1015 for me to push.

1483
01:44:59.68 --> 01:45:01.28
And then there's a very particular route

1484
01:45:01.28 --> 01:45:03.08
and a particular heading and turns and out.

1485
01:45:03.08 --> 01:45:05.20
And there's a whole sequence that we all memorized how to do it.

1486
01:45:05.20 --> 01:45:07.16
And it's not that complicated, but you gotta do it.

1487
01:45:07.16 --> 01:45:10.08
But the entire time, the entire time, as you're looking out,

1488
01:45:10.08 --> 01:45:12.56
you can't see anything.

1489
01:45:12.56 --> 01:45:15.20
It's just dark, it's just pitch black.

1490
01:45:15.20 --> 01:45:16.40
Every now and then there's like a nice moon,

1491
01:45:16.40 --> 01:45:18.88
the water has a little white reflection of the moon,

1492
01:45:18.88 --> 01:45:22.28
which looks kind of cool, but you can't see the ship.

1493
01:45:22.28 --> 01:45:24.64
When you're 20 miles from an airport,

1494
01:45:24.64 --> 01:45:26.80
you see the airport, you see the runway lights,

1495
01:45:26.80 --> 01:45:28.12
you see the lights that line you up,

1496
01:45:28.12 --> 01:45:29.76
you see the white lights, you see the control tower,

1497
01:45:29.76 --> 01:45:31.52
you can see your buildings.

1498
01:45:31.52 --> 01:45:32.64
When you're 20 miles from the ship,

1499
01:45:32.64 --> 01:45:34.68
you can't see anything.

1500
01:45:34.68 --> 01:45:36.16
And then when you're 10 miles from the ship,

1501
01:45:36.16 --> 01:45:37.88
you still can't see anything.

1502
01:45:37.88 --> 01:45:39.04
And then you descend down,

1503
01:45:39.04 --> 01:45:41.68
you do this the last bit of this approach.

1504
01:45:41.68 --> 01:45:46.68
At night, is it like 600 feet over the water?

1505
01:45:46.68 --> 01:45:50.68
And it's pitch black, and you're just going towards this.

1506
01:45:50.68 --> 01:45:52.04
And you're 100% instruments.

1507
01:45:52.04 --> 01:45:53.52
100% instruments.

1508
01:45:53.52 --> 01:45:56.56
And you know, and look, modern airplanes have great instruments.

1509
01:45:56.56 --> 01:45:58.28
They horned as a beautiful instrument,

1510
01:45:58.28 --> 01:46:00.44
an instrument, an instrument, a machine.

1511
01:46:00.44 --> 01:46:02.32
I'm sure, you know, when Yankego's

1512
01:46:02.32 --> 01:46:04.40
talking about back in the Vietnam era is more challenging,

1513
01:46:04.40 --> 01:46:05.72
but you're just flying to instruments.

1514
01:46:05.72 --> 01:46:07.40
More challenging, because homeboys up there

1515
01:46:07.40 --> 01:46:10.96
with a red lens flashlight, try to figure out where he's at.

1516
01:46:10.96 --> 01:46:11.96
You know, I had that story.

1517
01:46:11.96 --> 01:46:12.80
I mean, he's telling us story.

1518
01:46:12.80 --> 01:46:16.20
The yards above the looking for the weight of the ship.

1519
01:46:16.20 --> 01:46:17.20
Crazy.

1520
01:46:17.20 --> 01:46:18.76
You chuckled, because you were asking,

1521
01:46:18.76 --> 01:46:20.84
you're like, I think I know that flashlight.

1522
01:46:20.84 --> 01:46:22.96
I had the same flashlight on how my face is the same.

1523
01:46:22.96 --> 01:46:25.60
Green, Elmo, shape flashlight, we all have.

1524
01:46:25.60 --> 01:46:28.20
I mean, one thing that hasn't changed much in naval aviation,

1525
01:46:28.20 --> 01:46:29.24
it's the gear.

1526
01:46:29.24 --> 01:46:30.64
It's all the same stuff.

1527
01:46:30.64 --> 01:46:34.12
But as you're coming back, you're on instruments.

1528
01:46:34.12 --> 01:46:37.80
You're waiting for your turn for the final approach.

1529
01:46:37.80 --> 01:46:40.000
You know, the last mile of descent,

1530
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.28
where you go from 600 feet, and then you start to descend

1531
01:46:43.28 --> 01:46:45.56
down onto the boat itself.

1532
01:46:45.56 --> 01:46:48.52
And that's when you start picking up the visual cues,

1533
01:46:48.52 --> 01:46:51.64
the meatball they call, and kind of the line up of the runway.

1534
01:46:51.64 --> 01:46:55.28
But a lot of times, you still can't see the ship.

1535
01:46:55.28 --> 01:46:58.08
If there's cloudy or foggy or low or rain or snow

1536
01:46:58.08 --> 01:47:00.48
and all these things, and all these elements are just there.

1537
01:47:00.48 --> 01:47:02.12
And you have no choice.

1538
01:47:02.12 --> 01:47:03.52
You have no alternative.

1539
01:47:03.52 --> 01:47:05.20
And the psychological component of knowing

1540
01:47:05.20 --> 01:47:09.64
that every single time you're going to sort of duel with that,

1541
01:47:09.64 --> 01:47:15.000
it's in some ways, it's kind of terrifying.

1542
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.44
But in other ways, it means that every single,

1543
01:47:17.44 --> 01:47:21.12
there's a challenge in every single flight.

1544
01:47:21.12 --> 01:47:24.20
And I think one of the cool things about being around the ship,

1545
01:47:24.20 --> 01:47:26.64
and one of the things that makes naval aviation unique

1546
01:47:26.64 --> 01:47:29.16
with these guys in the Navy and the Marines that did it,

1547
01:47:29.16 --> 01:47:33.44
is that every single flight, there was this risk,

1548
01:47:33.44 --> 01:47:36.52
there was this fight that you were going to get the duel

1549
01:47:36.52 --> 01:47:39.84
against this machine, this boat, this thing that's out there,

1550
01:47:39.84 --> 01:47:43.60
that sort of geared and designed in every way, shape,

1551
01:47:43.60 --> 01:47:45.92
and form, it's a really bad airport.

1552
01:47:45.92 --> 01:47:48.72
It's not designed to be an airport.

1553
01:47:48.72 --> 01:47:51.84
It's got this time, and the margin of error is miniscule.

1554
01:47:51.84 --> 01:47:53.48
I think in the horn, at the margin of error,

1555
01:47:53.48 --> 01:47:55.04
from coming across, they call it the ramp.

1556
01:47:55.04 --> 01:47:56.76
That's the very first piece of steel

1557
01:47:56.76 --> 01:47:59.12
that you get over the top of the ship to land.

1558
01:47:59.12 --> 01:48:01.80
If you were eight feet off,

1559
01:48:01.80 --> 01:48:03.68
you're either going to miss and go around,

1560
01:48:03.68 --> 01:48:06.80
or if you're eight feet low, you were going to hit the ship.

1561
01:48:06.80 --> 01:48:09.28
So the margin of error is tiny.

1562
01:48:09.28 --> 01:48:11.60
Hold on a second.

1563
01:48:11.60 --> 01:48:15.92
What happens when you're in a 12-foot sea state?

1564
01:48:15.92 --> 01:48:17.24
Yeah.

1565
01:48:17.24 --> 01:48:19.80
Well, when you're in a 12-foot sea state,

1566
01:48:19.80 --> 01:48:21.32
and that thing's moving around,

1567
01:48:21.32 --> 01:48:24.84
the visual indications on the ship,

1568
01:48:24.84 --> 01:48:26.64
the visual thing we call it the meatball,

1569
01:48:26.64 --> 01:48:29.20
which is a light system that reflects where you are.

1570
01:48:29.20 --> 01:48:30.24
So if the light is high,

1571
01:48:30.24 --> 01:48:32.64
there's like a green light that goes back and forth,

1572
01:48:32.64 --> 01:48:34.44
there's a round yellow light in the middle.

1573
01:48:34.44 --> 01:48:36.96
It's round, it's yellow, so they call it the meatball.

1574
01:48:36.96 --> 01:48:38.12
Looks like a circle.

1575
01:48:38.12 --> 01:48:39.92
If that ball is above the green light,

1576
01:48:39.92 --> 01:48:42.36
it's your high, and if that ball is below the green light,

1577
01:48:42.36 --> 01:48:43.80
you're low, and you're kind of flying in around

1578
01:48:43.80 --> 01:48:45.84
to try to move that light, or that yellow ball

1579
01:48:45.84 --> 01:48:47.52
in between the green lights.

1580
01:48:47.52 --> 01:48:51.40
That system keeps up with ship's movement up to some degree.

1581
01:48:51.40 --> 01:48:53.04
I don't remember when exactly what it was,

1582
01:48:53.04 --> 01:48:54.56
the ship will kind of list back and forth,

1583
01:48:54.56 --> 01:48:56.08
it'll raise up and down.

1584
01:48:56.08 --> 01:48:57.72
And as long as it's not moving too fast

1585
01:48:57.72 --> 01:49:00.28
or too much, that light system is accurate.

1586
01:49:00.28 --> 01:49:04.88
Oh, so you're accommodating the movement of the ship,

1587
01:49:04.88 --> 01:49:05.76
absolutely, okay.

1588
01:49:05.76 --> 01:49:07.96
100% and you're moving your throttle,

1589
01:49:07.96 --> 01:49:09.88
let you know, forward and backwards,

1590
01:49:09.88 --> 01:49:13.28
10, 15 times every second to accommodate for that.

1591
01:49:13.28 --> 01:49:16.76
And the good thing is that it's good information.

1592
01:49:16.76 --> 01:49:18.64
It's trustworthy, so if the ball is high,

1593
01:49:18.64 --> 01:49:20.000
you're high, the ball is low as you're low.

1594
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.28
If the ball gets too low, it turns red,

1595
01:49:22.28 --> 01:49:24.28
you are dangerously low,

1596
01:49:24.28 --> 01:49:26.64
and that gives you a very good cue.

1597
01:49:26.64 --> 01:49:29.88
If the ship starts moving too fast or too much,

1598
01:49:29.88 --> 01:49:32.36
that system is no longer reliable.

1599
01:49:32.36 --> 01:49:34.32
It doesn't keep up with the movement of the ship fast,

1600
01:49:34.32 --> 01:49:35.72
so you cannot rely on that.

1601
01:49:35.72 --> 01:49:37.40
And then you're landing signals officers,

1602
01:49:37.40 --> 01:49:39.48
you're LSO, so your people that have radio

1603
01:49:39.48 --> 01:49:42.56
on the flight deck, they have to start talking to you.

1604
01:49:42.56 --> 01:49:45.96
And they'll say things like ignore the information

1605
01:49:45.96 --> 01:49:49.40
that you're seeing your low.

1606
01:49:49.40 --> 01:49:52.72
And now you're in this challenge of seeing this visual cue

1607
01:49:52.72 --> 01:49:55.48
that you've relied on hundreds of times.

1608
01:49:55.48 --> 01:49:58.80
And you have someone saying, ignore that information.

1609
01:49:58.80 --> 01:50:01.04
I'm telling you, you need to add power,

1610
01:50:01.04 --> 01:50:03.16
even though that's showing you high.

1611
01:50:03.16 --> 01:50:05.04
And look, those things don't happen all the time.

1612
01:50:05.04 --> 01:50:08.32
How can they give you the micro adjustments fast enough

1613
01:50:08.32 --> 01:50:10.12
in that situation?

1614
01:50:10.12 --> 01:50:12.64
The LSOs and look, one of the cool things,

1615
01:50:12.64 --> 01:50:15.000
or is it like power power power,

1616
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:15.92
break, break, break, break, break,

1617
01:50:15.92 --> 01:50:17.84
like a left left left left, is you doing that?

1618
01:50:17.84 --> 01:50:19.48
Not, it's quite as fast as you,

1619
01:50:19.48 --> 01:50:20.96
but that is what we were saying.

1620
01:50:20.96 --> 01:50:21.92
So I was in LSO.

1621
01:50:21.92 --> 01:50:23.32
One of the cool things in my career

1622
01:50:23.32 --> 01:50:25.64
when I was on the ship is I got to lead in LSO team.

1623
01:50:25.64 --> 01:50:27.56
So I was a landing signals officer,

1624
01:50:27.56 --> 01:50:30.08
so every fifth day on a cruise,

1625
01:50:30.08 --> 01:50:32.08
I just helped airplanes land.

1626
01:50:32.08 --> 01:50:34.20
I sat out there with a team on radios.

1627
01:50:34.20 --> 01:50:38.04
And usually, usually, if Jocco's coming in in Nizelo,

1628
01:50:38.04 --> 01:50:40.12
I can just say, little power.

1629
01:50:40.12 --> 01:50:40.96
That's all you need.

1630
01:50:40.96 --> 01:50:42.28
Just a little cool smooth call, and you,

1631
01:50:42.28 --> 01:50:44.000
okay, I'm behind and you'll add some power.

1632
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.24
Sometimes I'm like power, and you're like dang.

1633
01:50:46.24 --> 01:50:48.80
And you're hearing, and you're, and that's a little more,

1634
01:50:48.80 --> 01:50:50.76
a little heat, a little, a little,

1635
01:50:50.76 --> 01:50:52.68
a little bigger, a little more of a heater

1636
01:50:52.68 --> 01:50:54.48
than you might normally need.

1637
01:50:54.48 --> 01:50:56.80
There are a few times in every LSO,

1638
01:50:56.80 --> 01:50:58.24
let's listen to this, and every student

1639
01:50:58.24 --> 01:50:59.32
that's out there in play at school,

1640
01:50:59.32 --> 01:51:00.60
probably knows this.

1641
01:51:00.60 --> 01:51:03.36
There are times in my career that I've had to scream,

1642
01:51:03.36 --> 01:51:05.32
power, power, power, power,

1643
01:51:06.72 --> 01:51:11.36
and barely, barely got these airplanes over the ramp.

1644
01:51:11.36 --> 01:51:12.40
To the point that after they landed,

1645
01:51:12.40 --> 01:51:15.76
we'd go investigate and we'd see divots

1646
01:51:15.76 --> 01:51:18.16
on the very edge of the carrier called the rounddown.

1647
01:51:18.16 --> 01:51:20.24
Divots from the hook smashing.

1648
01:51:20.24 --> 01:51:22.40
The edge of the boat, which means that their,

1649
01:51:22.40 --> 01:51:27.000
their wheels may have missed it by no joke, two feet.

1650
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Something like that.

1651
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.32
So what you described doesn't happen very often,

1652
01:51:31.32 --> 01:51:32.96
but it absolutely does happen,

1653
01:51:32.96 --> 01:51:34.16
and then I would tell him, say,

1654
01:51:34.16 --> 01:51:36.76
you're lined up a little left.

1655
01:51:36.76 --> 01:51:39.04
And it was a right for a lineup, right for a lineup,

1656
01:51:39.04 --> 01:51:42.48
and you're talking to them, and the tone of your voice,

1657
01:51:42.48 --> 01:51:44.28
and the rate at which you say it,

1658
01:51:44.28 --> 01:51:46.64
hopefully, solicits the response.

1659
01:51:46.64 --> 01:51:48.64
Now, the interesting thing about that

1660
01:51:48.64 --> 01:51:52.80
is what do you think the mental state is of a pilot

1661
01:51:52.80 --> 01:51:56.48
who's so low and can't assess that on his own

1662
01:51:56.48 --> 01:51:58.08
to respond to your cues?

1663
01:51:58.08 --> 01:52:00.24
You're typically dealing with the guys who are so,

1664
01:52:00.24 --> 01:52:01.52
they were struggling behind the airplane,

1665
01:52:01.52 --> 01:52:04.52
so they didn't always necessarily respond to your calls.

1666
01:52:04.52 --> 01:52:06.04
They didn't attach.

1667
01:52:06.04 --> 01:52:10.72
And it's, that's the challenge of the night carrier landing

1668
01:52:10.72 --> 01:52:15.40
is can you detach from what can be by itself

1669
01:52:15.40 --> 01:52:18.96
under the best circumstances, a terrifying experience?

1670
01:52:18.96 --> 01:52:21.80
Oh, under the best nights.

1671
01:52:21.80 --> 01:52:26.08
And when you have engine problems, fuel leaks,

1672
01:52:26.08 --> 01:52:30.76
hydraulic issues, low on fuel, no diverts,

1673
01:52:30.76 --> 01:52:33.60
two in the morning in a snowstorm,

1674
01:52:33.60 --> 01:52:36.52
you have no choice but to get a board that ship.

1675
01:52:36.52 --> 01:52:39.96
And that is, that is why the carrier landing,

1676
01:52:39.96 --> 01:52:40.92
especially the night landing,

1677
01:52:40.92 --> 01:52:43.04
that is the great equalizer and aviation,

1678
01:52:43.04 --> 01:52:46.68
and here in Yank talk about it and reading about it,

1679
01:52:46.68 --> 01:52:48.72
there's nothing else in the world like it.

1680
01:52:48.72 --> 01:52:51.56
There's nothing of ever done that I can compare that

1681
01:52:51.56 --> 01:52:52.76
experience to.

1682
01:52:52.76 --> 01:52:55.40
And you said you did a hundred night carrier landings?

1683
01:52:55.40 --> 01:52:57.84
Yeah, I'm a sketchiest one.

1684
01:52:57.84 --> 01:53:02.84
Dude, so, I mean, I have landed in what we call 00.

1685
01:53:02.84 --> 01:53:05.04
I have landed where there is zero visibility.

1686
01:53:05.04 --> 01:53:06.04
Zero visibility.

1687
01:53:06.04 --> 01:53:06.88
Yep.

1688
01:53:06.88 --> 01:53:08.04
And what's the other zero?

1689
01:53:08.04 --> 01:53:11.32
So the two measures is the height of the clouds

1690
01:53:11.32 --> 01:53:13.12
and the depth which you can see them.

1691
01:53:13.12 --> 01:53:15.52
So, a hundred and a half would be

1692
01:53:15.52 --> 01:53:18.40
cloudsured, a hundred feet, visibility is a half a mile.

1693
01:53:18.40 --> 01:53:21.16
So, zero zero is the cloudsured, zero feet,

1694
01:53:21.16 --> 01:53:22.68
and your visibility is zero feet.

1695
01:53:22.68 --> 01:53:24.60
So you can kind of picture being in fog.

1696
01:53:24.60 --> 01:53:26.000
It may be on the ground, it may be at zero feet,

1697
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.76
but it's thin fog, you kind of may be see a mile in front of you.

1698
01:53:28.76 --> 01:53:29.72
You know, driving a car.

1699
01:53:29.72 --> 01:53:31.000
And if you've ever been in a car, we're like,

1700
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.48
dang, I can't see, I can't see 10 feet in front of me.

1701
01:53:34.48 --> 01:53:35.84
That's zero zero.

1702
01:53:35.84 --> 01:53:37.24
So you landed in zero zero zero.

1703
01:53:37.24 --> 01:53:38.40
Zero zero.

1704
01:53:38.40 --> 01:53:40.36
So here's how that works.

1705
01:53:40.36 --> 01:53:45.36
And here's how much fun the night zero zero landing is.

1706
01:53:45.56 --> 01:53:46.56
You can fly or engine.

1707
01:53:46.56 --> 01:53:48.56
You can see the meatball, you can't see anything.

1708
01:53:48.56 --> 01:53:50.20
Zero zero.

1709
01:53:50.20 --> 01:53:51.36
You see nothing, get some.

1710
01:53:51.36 --> 01:53:53.24
Yeah, these are good times.

1711
01:53:54.88 --> 01:53:55.88
So you've got your instruments though,

1712
01:53:55.88 --> 01:53:56.72
and your instruments.

1713
01:53:56.72 --> 01:53:58.28
That's what they want to be a fighter pilot

1714
01:53:58.28 --> 01:53:59.88
just during the Air Force bro.

1715
01:53:59.88 --> 01:54:01.04
Yeah, I don't want none of this.

1716
01:54:01.04 --> 01:54:03.12
If you're going to fly fighters in the Navy,

1717
01:54:03.12 --> 01:54:04.68
you need to know what you're getting yourself into.

1718
01:54:04.68 --> 01:54:07.24
Because you're going to have, you're night in the barrel.

1719
01:54:07.24 --> 01:54:08.48
There's not a pilot,

1720
01:54:08.48 --> 01:54:11.28
there's not a naval aviator in the world that hasn't had

1721
01:54:11.28 --> 01:54:13.96
that night, whatever that night is for you.

1722
01:54:13.96 --> 01:54:15.24
You're going to have that night.

1723
01:54:15.24 --> 01:54:17.16
And I bet you're the exact same thing in the teams.

1724
01:54:17.16 --> 01:54:18.56
Like you're going to have an experience.

1725
01:54:18.56 --> 01:54:20.28
You're going to have something that happens to you.

1726
01:54:20.28 --> 01:54:21.12
You cannot avoid it.

1727
01:54:21.12 --> 01:54:23.84
It's going to be your night or your day or your experience.

1728
01:54:23.84 --> 01:54:24.68
You're going to have that.

1729
01:54:24.68 --> 01:54:25.28
There's no getting around.

1730
01:54:25.28 --> 01:54:28.72
And we call it, everybody in naval aviation calls it

1731
01:54:28.72 --> 01:54:29.56
the night in the barrel.

1732
01:54:29.56 --> 01:54:30.40
That's your night.

1733
01:54:30.40 --> 01:54:31.76
And you know, you don't know what's going to happen.

1734
01:54:31.76 --> 01:54:34.68
It's just your night to deal with whatever you got to deal with.

1735
01:54:34.68 --> 01:54:37.60
That zero zero landing, your instruments will get you

1736
01:54:37.60 --> 01:54:42.16
to about maybe a quarter mile at best, maybe a half a mile.

1737
01:54:42.16 --> 01:54:46.76
So by the last eight seconds, once you're inside that last eight

1738
01:54:46.76 --> 01:54:48.68
seconds, your instruments just aren't,

1739
01:54:48.68 --> 01:54:50.68
they don't keep up with what's going on fast enough for you

1740
01:54:50.68 --> 01:54:51.28
to fly off them.

1741
01:54:51.28 --> 01:54:53.16
You have to transition to a visual landing.

1742
01:54:53.16 --> 01:54:54.84
You have to.

1743
01:54:54.84 --> 01:54:58.76
And the only way for that to work when you can't see

1744
01:54:58.76 --> 01:55:01.92
is for you to turn on your taxi light, which

1745
01:55:01.92 --> 01:55:04.88
is this giant, really high powered light in your nose gear.

1746
01:55:04.88 --> 01:55:05.92
And the LSO.

1747
01:55:05.92 --> 01:55:06.96
And this is a call.

1748
01:55:06.96 --> 01:55:10.76
You want to have your stomach drop when you're out in the stack

1749
01:55:10.76 --> 01:55:12.84
with nothing else to do, but think about your landing.

1750
01:55:12.84 --> 01:55:13.72
And you hear all the calls.

1751
01:55:13.72 --> 01:55:15.60
And he says, he says, he says, he comes over the radio.

1752
01:55:15.60 --> 01:55:19.44
99, which means when you say 99, that's a call for everybody.

1753
01:55:19.44 --> 01:55:22.08
99, taxi lights on.

1754
01:55:22.08 --> 01:55:26.000
Now, every pilot in the stack is like, oh, God, it's so bad

1755
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.36
that I now know that at the end of this landing,

1756
01:55:28.36 --> 01:55:30.96
I will not be able to see the carrier.

1757
01:55:30.96 --> 01:55:34.84
And the LSO is going to have to talk me down.

1758
01:55:34.84 --> 01:55:39.12
And you talk about trust and relationships

1759
01:55:39.12 --> 01:55:41.40
and putting your life in somebody else's hand.

1760
01:55:41.40 --> 01:55:43.96
You're going to fly this machine, do 140 knots,

1761
01:55:43.96 --> 01:55:50.28
this 35,000 pound machine, to a half a mile from the carrier.

1762
01:55:50.28 --> 01:55:53.56
And you'll never see the ship until you hit it.

1763
01:55:53.56 --> 01:55:56.56
And the guy on the ground is going to talk you

1764
01:55:56.56 --> 01:55:59.000
through the last eight seconds of that.

1765
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.80
And he's only going to do it through his eyeballs.

1766
01:56:00.80 --> 01:56:03.04
Literally through his eyeballs and the faint

1767
01:56:03.04 --> 01:56:05.88
through the fog that faint little glow of the white light

1768
01:56:05.88 --> 01:56:08.44
coming from your nose gear.

1769
01:56:08.44 --> 01:56:13.88
And that is a recalling that as we speak.

1770
01:56:13.88 --> 01:56:17.28
That is a life change in event right there.

1771
01:56:17.28 --> 01:56:20.24
I mean, that's a no joke experience.

1772
01:56:20.24 --> 01:56:22.28
So he's given you the same things.

1773
01:56:22.28 --> 01:56:25.28
He's eyeball.

1774
01:56:25.28 --> 01:56:26.28
He's eyeball-caler.

1775
01:56:26.28 --> 01:56:28.16
Real-trains this guy.

1776
01:56:28.16 --> 01:56:30.08
How does he know to do this?

1777
01:56:30.08 --> 01:56:35.96
Well, the LSO qualification at the Navy is typically reserved

1778
01:56:35.96 --> 01:56:37.16
for the best guys in the squadron.

1779
01:56:37.16 --> 01:56:43.64
Typically, not always, but it's a very highly thought

1780
01:56:43.64 --> 01:56:44.56
of quality.

1781
01:56:44.56 --> 01:56:46.96
It's a well-respected qualification that I'm going to take

1782
01:56:46.96 --> 01:56:47.96
Jaco.

1783
01:56:47.96 --> 01:56:48.68
We're going on cruise.

1784
01:56:48.68 --> 01:56:50.68
You've demonstrated it as a young guy's a nugget.

1785
01:56:50.68 --> 01:56:51.60
You're good around the ship.

1786
01:56:51.60 --> 01:56:52.72
You're reliable.

1787
01:56:52.72 --> 01:56:54.60
I'm going to task you with learning to be an LSO.

1788
01:56:54.60 --> 01:56:57.12
I'm going to put my pilot's life in your hands.

1789
01:56:57.12 --> 01:56:58.24
I would do that as a squadron commander.

1790
01:56:58.24 --> 01:57:00.68
I'm going to send you to school to be an LSO.

1791
01:57:00.68 --> 01:57:02.20
You'll go LSO training.

1792
01:57:02.20 --> 01:57:04.000
And then you'll go through kind of an apprenticeship

1793
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.40
where you sit and watch other LSOs.

1794
01:57:06.40 --> 01:57:08.20
And after about three or four months of that,

1795
01:57:08.20 --> 01:57:09.20
I'm going to give you the radio.

1796
01:57:09.20 --> 01:57:11.76
And on a perfectly clear gorgeous blue day,

1797
01:57:11.76 --> 01:57:15.16
I'm going to let you start to see what it looks like.

1798
01:57:15.16 --> 01:57:19.20
And you're doing it hundreds of times a day,

1799
01:57:19.20 --> 01:57:22.000
every five days, cruise after cruise after cruise.

1800
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.80
And eventually you build this capability through your own

1801
01:57:24.80 --> 01:57:26.12
experience to be able to do that.

1802
01:57:26.12 --> 01:57:29.36
Do they ever have to call in the cooler?

1803
01:57:29.36 --> 01:57:31.48
Like they're like, hey, man, it's 0-0.

1804
01:57:31.48 --> 01:57:34.52
Go get the ice man over there or whatever.

1805
01:57:34.52 --> 01:57:35.76
I can bring him up here.

1806
01:57:35.76 --> 01:57:36.72
Dude, that's no joke.

1807
01:57:36.72 --> 01:57:38.88
We call him the Kag LSO.

1808
01:57:38.88 --> 01:57:41.84
So on the ship, the air group is known as the Kag.

1809
01:57:41.84 --> 01:57:44.04
So the ship is the ship.

1810
01:57:44.04 --> 01:57:45.04
And they've got all their people.

1811
01:57:45.04 --> 01:57:47.20
And then the air wing is all the planes.

1812
01:57:47.20 --> 01:57:50.12
There are two guys that are the two senior landing

1813
01:57:50.12 --> 01:57:52.68
signals officers on the ship.

1814
01:57:52.68 --> 01:57:55.04
90% of the time, all the new one is training us

1815
01:57:55.04 --> 01:57:56.40
and letting us run the show.

1816
01:57:56.40 --> 01:58:01.60
Well, when it's 0-0, the cooler is the Kag LSO.

1817
01:58:01.60 --> 01:58:03.08
And he's going to be supported or backed up

1818
01:58:03.08 --> 01:58:04.68
by the team lead.

1819
01:58:04.68 --> 01:58:06.36
And so that guy and those nights,

1820
01:58:06.36 --> 01:58:08.16
he's going to be the primary controlling LSO.

1821
01:58:08.16 --> 01:58:09.40
He's going to do it one day in the talking.

1822
01:58:09.40 --> 01:58:11.96
And his backup is going to be the team leader

1823
01:58:11.96 --> 01:58:13.08
of that LSO teams.

1824
01:58:13.08 --> 01:58:14.80
There's five team leads, you know, five teams,

1825
01:58:14.80 --> 01:58:17.40
one for each day, you rotate every five days.

1826
01:58:17.40 --> 01:58:20.24
Those two guys, the Kag LSO, the cooler,

1827
01:58:20.24 --> 01:58:23.04
and the team lead are going to recover every airplane

1828
01:58:23.04 --> 01:58:25.000
on the ship when it's required.

1829
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.12
Are you answering, sir, you're coming in 0-0.

1830
01:58:28.12 --> 01:58:30.84
And I tell you, power, what do you say, Roger?

1831
01:58:30.84 --> 01:58:32.36
No, you don't talk at all.

1832
01:58:32.36 --> 01:58:33.80
You just do what he says.

1833
01:58:33.80 --> 01:58:36.52
And so, and I can tell by watching your aircraft,

1834
01:58:36.52 --> 01:58:38.28
you can also hear it.

1835
01:58:38.28 --> 01:58:39.88
You can, so you're a quarter mile away,

1836
01:58:39.88 --> 01:58:41.44
you're seven, eight seconds from landing.

1837
01:58:41.44 --> 01:58:43.96
When I say power, or when I say power,

1838
01:58:43.96 --> 01:58:47.56
and you add power, your motors are going to change.

1839
01:58:47.56 --> 01:58:48.36
You're going to hear that.

1840
01:58:48.36 --> 01:58:49.56
You're going to hear the tone of that.

1841
01:58:49.56 --> 01:58:50.60
And you're going to, he did it.

1842
01:58:50.60 --> 01:58:52.44
And you can hear the duration.

1843
01:58:52.44 --> 01:58:56.28
And so, if I say power and you add it, and it's not enough,

1844
01:58:56.28 --> 01:58:57.40
I'm going to immediately say it again.

1845
01:58:57.40 --> 01:58:58.60
Before I even watch you settle,

1846
01:58:58.60 --> 01:59:00.44
because I know you didn't do it long enough.

1847
01:59:00.44 --> 01:59:02.52
And I'm going to say power, power, and that means you're

1848
01:59:02.52 --> 01:59:03.96
going to go longer.

1849
01:59:03.96 --> 01:59:07.16
And if you go too long, and I hear you really run the engines,

1850
01:59:07.16 --> 01:59:08.52
I'm going to say easy with it.

1851
01:59:08.52 --> 01:59:09.96
I'm going to ask you, and you're going to bring power off.

1852
01:59:09.96 --> 01:59:11.72
And so, I'm going to talk, I'm going to watch

1853
01:59:11.72 --> 01:59:14.20
or this uniform, for words used by all.

1854
01:59:14.20 --> 01:59:18.20
Every single word in the LSO manual is exactly the same.

1855
01:59:18.20 --> 01:59:21.88
People, we only use one word for power.

1856
01:59:21.88 --> 01:59:23.32
Only one word for take off power.

1857
01:59:23.32 --> 01:59:25.40
One word to turn right, one word to turn left,

1858
01:59:25.40 --> 01:59:27.48
and if they're pretty determined, they all know.

1859
01:59:27.48 --> 01:59:28.84
Everybody else, so I use the exact same thing.

1860
01:59:28.84 --> 01:59:29.96
Did you say easy, buddy?

1861
01:59:29.96 --> 01:59:30.36
What is it?

1862
01:59:30.36 --> 01:59:31.64
Easy with it.

1863
01:59:31.64 --> 01:59:31.96
Easy with it.

1864
01:59:31.96 --> 01:59:34.68
And that's the terminology in the book.

1865
01:59:34.68 --> 01:59:36.44
Easy with it means back off power a little bit.

1866
01:59:36.44 --> 01:59:37.16
That's right.

1867
01:59:37.16 --> 01:59:40.04
If you're going to have someone go right, you say right for line up.

1868
01:59:40.04 --> 01:59:42.20
If you're going to have someone go to the left, you say,

1869
01:59:42.20 --> 01:59:43.40
come left.

1870
01:59:43.40 --> 01:59:45.56
That way, if you said, come left, come right.

1871
01:59:45.56 --> 01:59:48.12
You might get a little, not sure right for line up left,

1872
01:59:48.12 --> 01:59:52.28
you might have a different version of going right, and then there is going left.

1873
01:59:52.28 --> 01:59:54.92
Every pilot in the world, and everybody else knows in the world,

1874
01:59:54.92 --> 01:59:56.68
he's going to go left, come left.

1875
01:59:56.68 --> 01:59:58.68
If you want to go right, right for line up.

1876
01:59:58.68 --> 02:00:02.52
And as I started to hear the, I know he's telling me right for line up,

1877
02:00:02.52 --> 02:00:04.84
because I don't have to really decide for that call.

1878
02:00:04.84 --> 02:00:07.72
And if I hear the E in the easy with it,

1879
02:00:07.72 --> 02:00:09.40
I'm coming off the power a little bit.

1880
02:00:09.40 --> 02:00:12.68
And so there are, you know, the terms are totally predefined.

1881
02:00:12.68 --> 02:00:15.32
Everybody knows what they are, and we rely on those.

1882
02:00:15.32 --> 02:00:20.92
And so the zero zero recovery doesn't happen all that often, but it happens.

1883
02:00:20.92 --> 02:00:23.72
You can't see the ship until you hit it.

1884
02:00:23.72 --> 02:00:23.72
Yeah.

1885
02:00:23.72 --> 02:00:28.36
As zero zero landing, you may get lucky that a half a second before you feel

1886
02:00:28.36 --> 02:00:31.88
the shutter of hitting the flight deck, you might catch something out of the corner.

1887
02:00:31.88 --> 02:00:32.68
Right.

1888
02:00:32.68 --> 02:00:37.72
And meanwhile, at that moment, you go prepared to go full, you actually go full throttle

1889
02:00:37.72 --> 02:00:38.84
when you hit the deck, right?

1890
02:00:38.84 --> 02:00:42.92
You feel your, when you hear your tires hit the flight deck, you go full power.

1891
02:00:42.92 --> 02:00:46.68
Yeah, every time.

1892
02:00:46.68 --> 02:00:50.68
That way, if you miss you're taking off, you're not just falling into the drain.

1893
02:00:50.68 --> 02:00:51.68
That's right.

1894
02:00:51.68 --> 02:00:52.68
That's exactly right.

1895
02:00:52.68 --> 02:00:53.68
If you miss, you go back around.

1896
02:00:53.68 --> 02:00:54.68
Yeah.

1897
02:00:54.68 --> 02:01:01.08
And, you know, that, that LSO piece of flying around the ship is also a skill that it's really

1898
02:01:01.08 --> 02:01:06.56
hard to get people to appreciate how, how good you have to be.

1899
02:01:06.56 --> 02:01:10.88
How much confidence is an LSO you have to be to say, I got this.

1900
02:01:10.88 --> 02:01:17.88
I would 1000 times over, like, prefer to be the guy that's the pilot and not be the guy that's,

1901
02:01:17.88 --> 02:01:22.92
you know, it's one of those horrible situations where you're not actually in danger.

1902
02:01:22.92 --> 02:01:26.52
But you've got someone that's relying on you to get it right.

1903
02:01:26.52 --> 02:01:28.64
Yeah.

1904
02:01:28.64 --> 02:01:32.76
You'd be a good LSO, because you also know the power.

1905
02:01:32.76 --> 02:01:36.92
You've talked about all the time of just how you communicate.

1906
02:01:36.92 --> 02:01:40.84
The LSO is that panic when you're, when I look up and I see your jet in a real

1907
02:01:40.84 --> 02:01:43.80
bad spot, a really bad spot.

1908
02:01:43.80 --> 02:01:47.84
And if I panic in my communication to you, and I doesn't mean I won't be stern and very

1909
02:01:47.84 --> 02:01:49.52
specific, power.

1910
02:01:49.52 --> 02:01:53.24
But if I panic and I have a high pitch, kind of a shrill towel I'm communicating, you're

1911
02:01:53.24 --> 02:01:54.24
going to react that way.

1912
02:01:54.24 --> 02:01:59.56
So, the best LSOs, or the guys that will look at the worst situation in the most dire circumstances

1913
02:01:59.56 --> 02:02:05.88
and the worst weather, where the pilot that he knows has one chance to get aboard, one chance.

1914
02:02:05.88 --> 02:02:13.32
And he has the coolest, calmest, most chill voice in the world.

1915
02:02:13.32 --> 02:02:16.44
Two or two, you're a little low, just a little power.

1916
02:02:16.44 --> 02:02:17.84
You're on a glide slope.

1917
02:02:17.84 --> 02:02:22.24
And that can put a pallet in these to go, oh, holy cow, I can do this.

1918
02:02:22.24 --> 02:02:25.56
I can get aboard now, whereas before he's thinking I can't see the ship, I got this engine

1919
02:02:25.56 --> 02:02:26.56
problem.

1920
02:02:26.56 --> 02:02:28.76
I got all these things and creates a situation as a mind that he knows he can't get

1921
02:02:28.76 --> 02:02:29.76
aboard.

1922
02:02:29.76 --> 02:02:32.36
And LSO can talk him out of that mindset and get him on the flight deck.

1923
02:02:32.36 --> 02:02:39.56
So when Dan was talking about the guy that missed 12 times in a row, and I think it wasn't

1924
02:02:39.56 --> 02:02:42.32
it, Dan that actually went down there and said, let me get on the radio, let me talk

1925
02:02:42.32 --> 02:02:43.32
for this guy on.

1926
02:02:43.32 --> 02:02:45.76
And that's the same thing he says, hey, but we're going to get it done.

1927
02:02:45.76 --> 02:02:47.36
We're going to get done right this time.

1928
02:02:47.36 --> 02:02:48.36
Yep.

1929
02:02:48.36 --> 02:02:52.80
And if it's from the right person or the right time in the right way, it makes all the difference.

1930
02:02:52.80 --> 02:02:54.60
And that was that guy's night in the barrel.

1931
02:02:54.60 --> 02:02:56.20
I mean, that's a lot.

1932
02:02:56.20 --> 02:02:57.20
That's not common.

1933
02:02:57.20 --> 02:03:00.24
The reason you don't get another shot is because you're out of fuel.

1934
02:03:00.24 --> 02:03:03.24
Don't you have a refueler up there?

1935
02:03:03.24 --> 02:03:06.12
Yeah, usually you do.

1936
02:03:06.12 --> 02:03:09.96
There are emergencies that your jet will not take gas.

1937
02:03:09.96 --> 02:03:10.96
You've got emergency.

1938
02:03:10.96 --> 02:03:13.64
You've got a hydraulic problem that even if you had all the fuel in the world, eventually

1939
02:03:13.64 --> 02:03:16.92
your hydraulic fluid will run out and you can't fly the airplane.

1940
02:03:16.92 --> 02:03:22.96
So in most, these are not common cases, but there are cases of this happens.

1941
02:03:22.96 --> 02:03:26.000
What do you do if you are out of hydraulic fuel, you missed your landing?

1942
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.80
What's the protocol to eject now?

1943
02:03:27.80 --> 02:03:28.80
What do you do?

1944
02:03:28.80 --> 02:03:29.80
You're a certain spot.

1945
02:03:29.80 --> 02:03:30.80
You, they spin up.

1946
02:03:30.80 --> 02:03:31.80
They get the helicopter's ready.

1947
02:03:31.80 --> 02:03:32.80
That's exactly right.

1948
02:03:32.80 --> 02:03:33.80
So there's two options.

1949
02:03:33.80 --> 02:03:35.48
You got a barricade option.

1950
02:03:35.48 --> 02:03:40.000
But if it's on a controllable situation, the saying is, you pull alongside the ship and

1951
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
eject.

1952
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.64
So what you do is you try to fly a parallel straight across aboard the ship, you know, a

1953
02:03:45.64 --> 02:03:46.64
mile a beam.

1954
02:03:46.64 --> 02:03:47.64
The helicopters out there spinning.

1955
02:03:47.64 --> 02:03:51.04
There's always a helicopter flying when you're coming aboard, at least during the

1956
02:03:51.04 --> 02:03:52.04
day.

1957
02:03:52.04 --> 02:03:56.56
And I've never, I've never been under cruise where we had to intentionally do that.

1958
02:03:56.56 --> 02:04:00.28
I've been on cruise as we started briefing that option as an LSO.

1959
02:04:00.28 --> 02:04:02.44
Like, okay, here's what we're going to do.

1960
02:04:02.44 --> 02:04:03.44
This is what our planning to be.

1961
02:04:03.44 --> 02:04:06.64
You're starting to coordinate with the ships and emergency recovery team on this is what

1962
02:04:06.64 --> 02:04:13.60
we're going to do if indeed we don't, you know, get this guy aboard for whatever reason.

1963
02:04:13.60 --> 02:04:14.92
Life of the ship is no joke.

1964
02:04:14.92 --> 02:04:19.12
And the Navy makes it look easy because they're doing it hundreds of times a day, every

1965
02:04:19.12 --> 02:04:25.76
single day, and 99 times out of 100, 999 out of a thousand, these dire situations, they

1966
02:04:25.76 --> 02:04:26.76
pull it off.

1967
02:04:26.76 --> 02:04:30.92
And the only ones we ever hear about are the ones that it really, but these type of things

1968
02:04:30.92 --> 02:04:33.08
happen all the time.

1969
02:04:33.08 --> 02:04:35.56
These dangerous situations are happening right now.

1970
02:04:35.56 --> 02:04:42.28
There's someone in the, someone in the barrel once a day on the, on a carrier deployment,

1971
02:04:42.28 --> 02:04:43.28
once a week.

1972
02:04:43.28 --> 02:04:44.28
Yeah.

1973
02:04:44.28 --> 02:04:48.32
Once a day is, no, I'd say more often than not, certainly when weather is good.

1974
02:04:48.32 --> 02:04:49.32
I mean, it's smooth.

1975
02:04:49.32 --> 02:04:55.52
I mean, you're putting 120 aboard and, you know, launching recovery in a day and most days

1976
02:04:55.52 --> 02:04:56.96
just go by.

1977
02:04:56.96 --> 02:05:00.56
But if you've got, you know, if you did the math that we've got, multiple carriers, deployed

1978
02:05:00.56 --> 02:05:04.84
to see it all the time, and you're doing multiple flight ups all the time, once a week out

1979
02:05:04.84 --> 02:05:10.64
there somewhere in the blue ocean, there's a kid up there who's struggling.

1980
02:05:10.64 --> 02:05:14.52
It might not be 12, you know, but he's struggling and he's having a hard time and you're

1981
02:05:14.52 --> 02:05:17.96
watching him have a hard time and you're trying to talk him down.

1982
02:05:17.96 --> 02:05:20.000
Did you ever have a hard time?

1983
02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.64
Did you ever get shook to the point where you came back and like had a decompress and

1984
02:05:24.64 --> 02:05:27.32
said, you know what?

1985
02:05:27.32 --> 02:05:35.76
This, I had a, I had a buddy in the, in the teams and he did, he did a, he's doing some,

1986
02:05:35.76 --> 02:05:43.32
we'll just say maritime operations off the coast of Korea for an exercise.

1987
02:05:43.32 --> 02:05:48.20
And it was just freezing cold and claustrophobic in the whole nine yards and he was

1988
02:05:48.20 --> 02:05:54.20
telling me, you know, he's in this evolution and he's thinking of himself.

1989
02:05:54.20 --> 02:05:58.04
I don't even know if I actually ever want to do this again.

1990
02:05:58.04 --> 02:06:00.44
You don't even know if you think about that.

1991
02:06:00.44 --> 02:06:05.40
So, like, we're not kid and, you know, the kid that Dan talks about that does 12, 12 tries

1992
02:06:05.40 --> 02:06:06.40
to make it in the next day.

1993
02:06:06.40 --> 02:06:09.64
They put him right back up there and he did fine.

1994
02:06:09.64 --> 02:06:15.84
Did you ever get shook as they say in modern terminology?

1995
02:06:15.84 --> 02:06:21.96
I struggled in the beginning before I would go launch.

1996
02:06:21.96 --> 02:06:26.04
I had a real problem in the very beginning when I got assigned to a carrier squadron and

1997
02:06:26.04 --> 02:06:32.04
I kind of had to come to grips with this is going to move my day to day life.

1998
02:06:32.04 --> 02:06:35.48
I think I might even mention it to, I think I mentioned the name Gunny Pilgrim being just

1999
02:06:35.48 --> 02:06:40.28
this awesome gunnery sergeant that taught me everything as a lieutenant.

2000
02:06:40.28 --> 02:06:45.48
He and I were pretty tight and I'd say for the first, probably the first month of my

2001
02:06:45.48 --> 02:06:49.88
carrier career where I'm doing sustained cyclic carrier operations.

2002
02:06:49.88 --> 02:06:55.32
If I was, I would walk up on the flight deck, I would pre-flight my jet and I'd throw

2003
02:06:55.32 --> 02:06:59.96
up over the side of the ship, just from nerves and anxiety and just like man, just being

2004
02:06:59.96 --> 02:07:00.96
stressed.

2005
02:07:00.96 --> 02:07:06.72
I would just be physically ill and I didn't tell anybody about it and he knew and so

2006
02:07:06.72 --> 02:07:09.40
if he ever managed to find this guy, he'll tell those stories.

2007
02:07:09.40 --> 02:07:13.44
It was just something I just had to learn to deal with.

2008
02:07:13.44 --> 02:07:16.52
You man up, I don't mean the phrase man up.

2009
02:07:16.52 --> 02:07:20.24
We call getting it on airplane manning up, you climb up the ladder to man up your jet,

2010
02:07:20.24 --> 02:07:24.72
we manned up the jets and you'd go and you'd come back and then at the end you'd look back

2011
02:07:24.72 --> 02:07:26.16
and that was awesome.

2012
02:07:26.16 --> 02:07:30.32
Then we'd just have to go to the again, you'd get nauseous and that subsided.

2013
02:07:30.32 --> 02:07:33.52
I did have a couple of landings and he described really well, I had a couple of landings

2014
02:07:33.52 --> 02:07:39.56
that were so kind of terrifying that I couldn't control my legs, so my legs would shake

2015
02:07:39.56 --> 02:07:45.48
so fast and so your feet would, from the adrenaline that it'd be hard to steer the airplane

2016
02:07:45.48 --> 02:07:48.48
and a couple of times I had to stop the airplane and the flight deck grew kind of

2017
02:07:48.48 --> 02:07:49.48
understances.

2018
02:07:49.48 --> 02:07:53.44
When you just stop the kind of look at you and you just, you kind of give me a second.

2019
02:07:53.44 --> 02:07:54.44
So I had several times.

2020
02:07:54.44 --> 02:07:56.64
This is after you hooked onto the hook.

2021
02:07:56.64 --> 02:08:01.40
You come to a stop, you kind of turn off and that adrenaline wash kind of goes out

2022
02:08:01.40 --> 02:08:05.60
so maybe about a minute after that your whole body will convulse.

2023
02:08:05.60 --> 02:08:08.000
You steer everything with your legs, you're putting a lot of pressure on your feet

2024
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.72
and your toes and you maneuver the airplane with your feet and your legs are shaking so hard

2025
02:08:12.72 --> 02:08:17.32
that you literally can't steer and you're margined for like they take it to the side

2026
02:08:17.32 --> 02:08:19.40
of the ship like three feet away from the edge of the ship.

2027
02:08:19.40 --> 02:08:22.52
So you're looking over the water and you're just kind of, so I've had several landings

2028
02:08:22.52 --> 02:08:26.40
or after I landed, I needed to stop for a second and just like, hey dude, just give me a second.

2029
02:08:26.40 --> 02:08:33.08
I would just stop the airplane and usually they would look at you and go, take catch your breath.

2030
02:08:33.08 --> 02:08:37.92
I never got out of the airplane and said I don't want to do that anymore.

2031
02:08:37.92 --> 02:08:42.80
And I had some pretty rough nights and I think there was just this piece of this idea

2032
02:08:42.80 --> 02:08:52.92
that it's like, you wouldn't send something a long time ago that I just laughed at

2033
02:08:52.92 --> 02:08:57.84
and I'm like, that's not me. And you said I like the taste of blood.

2034
02:08:57.84 --> 02:09:00.84
You like, and I kind of took it like, you like fighting.

2035
02:09:00.84 --> 02:09:05.36
I don't mean it like you like to fight other people but that feeling that you get you

2036
02:09:05.36 --> 02:09:06.36
like that feeling.

2037
02:09:06.36 --> 02:09:11.16
Well, I told him, I don't like the taste of blood.

2038
02:09:11.16 --> 02:09:17.56
Flying a fighter around the ship with all the things that made me think about not wanting

2039
02:09:17.56 --> 02:09:19.56
to do it.

2040
02:09:19.56 --> 02:09:23.24
All the danger, all the immerne's is all I loved it.

2041
02:09:23.24 --> 02:09:28.88
I freaking loved every second of it, even the things that I hated and there were things

2042
02:09:28.88 --> 02:09:30.72
I hated about it.

2043
02:09:30.72 --> 02:09:33.72
I loved it and I loved doing it.

2044
02:09:33.72 --> 02:09:40.48
And I hated it at the same time but not once that I ever say I don't want to keep doing

2045
02:09:40.48 --> 02:09:41.48
that.

2046
02:09:41.48 --> 02:09:44.56
How am I as a crew and on later on, but being around the ship, being on the ship, doing

2047
02:09:44.56 --> 02:09:46.32
ship things as much as I hated it.

2048
02:09:46.32 --> 02:09:49.84
My squadron was telling me they did not like flying around the ship. I hated it.

2049
02:09:49.84 --> 02:09:51.80
But man, I freaking loved it.

2050
02:09:51.80 --> 02:09:54.20
So that was kind of my personal experience.

2051
02:09:54.20 --> 02:09:55.20
Everybody's different.

2052
02:09:55.20 --> 02:09:57.12
I never really quite normalized to it.

2053
02:09:57.12 --> 02:09:59.44
I always just felt like man this sucks.

2054
02:09:59.44 --> 02:10:04.44
But there was something about it that never got old and never got tired for me.

2055
02:10:04.44 --> 02:10:07.80
And I loved doing it.

2056
02:10:07.80 --> 02:10:15.28
Yeah, and it's weird because that idea of I like to taste a blood.

2057
02:10:15.28 --> 02:10:21.92
It's one of those things where when I haven't tasted blood, no I don't, I don't notice

2058
02:10:21.92 --> 02:10:23.92
I'm not sitting or thinking about it.

2059
02:10:23.92 --> 02:10:26.56
And then all of a sudden something will happen.

2060
02:10:26.56 --> 02:10:28.56
Something will happen.

2061
02:10:28.56 --> 02:10:31.20
It could be, any number of things.

2062
02:10:31.20 --> 02:10:34.36
It could be something as simple, not usually.

2063
02:10:34.36 --> 02:10:37.20
Did you do to me isn't this type of thing?

2064
02:10:37.20 --> 02:10:40.80
Maybe occasionally it'll be something will happen on the mats.

2065
02:10:40.80 --> 02:10:42.04
But normally that's not it.

2066
02:10:42.04 --> 02:10:45.52
I just enjoyed you just too much, but something will happen.

2067
02:10:45.52 --> 02:10:48.44
Some situation will unfold.

2068
02:10:48.44 --> 02:10:52.04
And I'll go into like war mode.

2069
02:10:52.04 --> 02:10:55.92
And when I go to war mode, I just feel so good.

2070
02:10:55.92 --> 02:10:59.32
And when I get there, I'm like, oh yeah.

2071
02:10:59.32 --> 02:11:08.24
It makes me, you know, sometimes I, when I get there, it makes me just look around and

2072
02:11:08.24 --> 02:11:15.68
I just think I wasn't really supposed to be doing anything else.

2073
02:11:15.68 --> 02:11:20.24
You know, it wasn't really supposed to be doing anything else.

2074
02:11:20.24 --> 02:11:29.96
I was supposed to be doing that, that thing because it makes me feel so, so good to, to be

2075
02:11:29.96 --> 02:11:35.68
in that mode, to feel that focus, to have like for me.

2076
02:11:35.68 --> 02:11:41.84
And this is just so weird for me because you know, I like to, you know, where we're building

2077
02:11:41.84 --> 02:11:46.64
relationships, we're building teams, we're working together.

2078
02:11:46.64 --> 02:11:52.84
For me, when I have an opponent, not just an opponent, it has to be stronger than that.

2079
02:11:52.84 --> 02:12:05.64
When I have somebody or some entity, that is antagonistic to me and my family, that's

2080
02:12:05.64 --> 02:12:09.28
me, my friends, my team.

2081
02:12:09.28 --> 02:12:15.88
I feel something that is the best feeling to me.

2082
02:12:15.88 --> 02:12:17.96
And it, and it doesn't happen that much anymore.

2083
02:12:17.96 --> 02:12:18.96
I mean, it just doesn't.

2084
02:12:18.96 --> 02:12:20.32
I mean, that's just the way it is.

2085
02:12:20.32 --> 02:12:26.32
But like even, you know, even when I was a cartoon commander and something would happen,

2086
02:12:26.32 --> 02:12:32.28
some, some other, you know, whether it was, whether it was the enemy, whether it was some

2087
02:12:32.28 --> 02:12:37.36
part of some organization, you know, some person that had something, did something that

2088
02:12:37.36 --> 02:12:42.36
was, I don't, I want to throw this word out there because it just, it just sets off a whole

2089
02:12:42.36 --> 02:12:44.56
bunch of, you know, what could it be?

2090
02:12:44.56 --> 02:12:53.000
But, you know, if there's a betrayal scenario where someone betrays me and they want

2091
02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:59.32
to go to war with me, that delivers me.

2092
02:12:59.32 --> 02:13:05.44
You know, that's when I, I love the taste of blood and I, and I can feel it.

2093
02:13:05.44 --> 02:13:12.36
And you know, like I said, it's, it's, you know, it's an old man talking now and just

2094
02:13:12.36 --> 02:13:16.36
don't get those situations very often.

2095
02:13:16.36 --> 02:13:21.48
But it's good, it's good feeling.

2096
02:13:21.48 --> 02:13:23.48
Yeah, happens from time to time.

2097
02:13:23.48 --> 02:13:29.20
Well, it's, it's uniler tool been, at least for this game, at this point.

2098
02:13:29.20 --> 02:13:33.56
But if I were to look back, and I spent a lot of my life dreaming of being a fighter pilot,

2099
02:13:33.56 --> 02:13:40.48
a lot of my life was spent dreaming about doing the things that I got to do.

2100
02:13:40.48 --> 02:13:47.68
If you were to ask me at any point during my time at sea, flying what I was doing, that

2101
02:13:47.68 --> 02:13:55.28
I could have done anything anywhere for any amount of money, there's not one single thing

2102
02:13:55.28 --> 02:13:57.92
in the world I would have done.

2103
02:13:57.92 --> 02:14:02.84
On my worst night, on my scariest, whatever, not one other thing.

2104
02:14:02.84 --> 02:14:07.08
And when you said what you said that, that I think described that feeling is, this is what

2105
02:14:07.08 --> 02:14:08.28
I'm supposed to be doing.

2106
02:14:08.28 --> 02:14:13.52
And every night, the thing that you were fighting, you know, in some sense was yourself,

2107
02:14:13.52 --> 02:14:18.88
but it was that environment that is sort of designed to kill you.

2108
02:14:18.88 --> 02:14:20.20
It's dark.

2109
02:14:20.20 --> 02:14:27.32
It's pitch black at night and it's a steel unforgiving ship with a tiny little area

2110
02:14:27.32 --> 02:14:34.44
that's 42 feet wide and a hundred and everything about that on paper is designed to kill

2111
02:14:34.44 --> 02:14:35.44
you.

2112
02:14:35.44 --> 02:14:39.68
And the only way you're going to outmaneuver that is what you and your machine

2113
02:14:39.68 --> 02:14:48.20
do and there was a piece of that fight, which I think is what it was, is that the satisfaction

2114
02:14:48.20 --> 02:14:54.24
of doing that on the best days of the worst days is really hard to recreate and replicate

2115
02:14:54.24 --> 02:14:55.96
and feel in other ways.

2116
02:14:55.96 --> 02:15:00.08
That satisfaction of I did something I was supposed to be doing and if I didn't do a well

2117
02:15:00.08 --> 02:15:04.52
enough, it was going to get me hurt or killed or the people around me hurt or killed.

2118
02:15:04.52 --> 02:15:08.28
And I haven't experienced a lot of other things like that.

2119
02:15:08.28 --> 02:15:15.32
It's rare to be in a work environment where you get that so regularly.

2120
02:15:15.32 --> 02:15:17.000
That's every single landing.

2121
02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.60
If you take your eye off the ball, no pun intended, on the most clear, perfect blue sky

2122
02:15:22.60 --> 02:15:27.48
day, you'll kill yourself.

2123
02:15:27.48 --> 02:15:31.16
You'll get yourself killed and you probably hurt a lot of people along the way.

2124
02:15:31.16 --> 02:15:37.84
And there was a challenge there that I never got tired of, which was for me doing what you

2125
02:15:37.84 --> 02:15:41.12
described, this is what I'm supposed to be doing.

2126
02:15:41.12 --> 02:15:47.000
Can you imagine the screening process that it's the de facto screening process that we

2127
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.000
can launch?

2128
02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.40
I mean, how many guys are landing on a carrier today, right?

2129
02:15:52.40 --> 02:15:54.76
And that happens all the time.

2130
02:15:54.76 --> 02:15:58.60
And this screening process and the training process is so good that these guys can pull

2131
02:15:58.60 --> 02:16:03.60
this off over and over again around the world and every see state day, night, clouds, no

2132
02:16:03.60 --> 02:16:05.60
clouds fog, no fog.

2133
02:16:05.60 --> 02:16:06.60
That's what?

2134
02:16:06.60 --> 02:16:08.60
That's what we do.

2135
02:16:08.60 --> 02:16:10.28
I mean, I want to get a look at it.

2136
02:16:10.28 --> 02:16:11.28
It's crazy.

2137
02:16:11.28 --> 02:16:12.28
Yeah.

2138
02:16:12.28 --> 02:16:13.28
It's crazy.

2139
02:16:13.28 --> 02:16:19.16
I mean, it ships doing well over 100 a day, every single day.

2140
02:16:19.16 --> 02:16:24.96
And yeah, dude, what the Navy is doing, it's unreal, man.

2141
02:16:24.96 --> 02:16:25.96
It's awesome.

2142
02:16:25.96 --> 02:16:34.50
So with that, does that then, is this where, okay, look, the inside the Navy, inside the

2143
02:16:34.50 --> 02:16:39.38
Navy, where you cannot surrender because you cannot give up the ship because otherwise

2144
02:16:39.38 --> 02:16:42.74
you all die inside the Navy.

2145
02:16:42.74 --> 02:16:46.74
You have this, this of all the people that are in the Navy, of all the people that are in

2146
02:16:46.74 --> 02:16:52.02
the Marine Corps, a little bit different, because it's just a different subset, right?

2147
02:16:52.02 --> 02:16:59.34
But the subset of Marine Corps aviators, fighter jet pilots, the Navy, it's more prevalent

2148
02:16:59.34 --> 02:17:00.34
in the Navy.

2149
02:17:00.34 --> 02:17:01.34
Let's face it.

2150
02:17:01.34 --> 02:17:10.34
Delta between a surface warfare officer in the Navy and a Navy fighter pilot.

2151
02:17:10.34 --> 02:17:18.46
That Delta is bigger than the Delta between a Marine Corps infantry officer and a Marine

2152
02:17:18.46 --> 02:17:20.18
Corps fighter pilot.

2153
02:17:20.18 --> 02:17:30.30
Unless we want to go back to World War II, then you want to see some just insane, incredible,

2154
02:17:30.30 --> 02:17:34.06
that they're, I mean, the danger of being on a Navy ship in World War II was totally insane

2155
02:17:34.06 --> 02:17:35.06
as well.

2156
02:17:35.06 --> 02:17:42.70
So the Delta, the screening process, where you get to, is you end up with a certain type of

2157
02:17:42.70 --> 02:17:43.70
person.

2158
02:17:43.70 --> 02:17:49.26
So in the Navy, when you are going to go for the SEAL teams, there's a certain element that's

2159
02:17:49.26 --> 02:17:50.26
there.

2160
02:17:50.26 --> 02:17:56.82
And for lack of a better word, and I think I'm using it because Dan talked about it,

2161
02:17:56.82 --> 02:17:59.26
there's a rebellious nature, right?

2162
02:17:59.26 --> 02:18:02.10
There's someone that's going, hey, look, I don't care.

2163
02:18:02.10 --> 02:18:08.46
Look, you don't fall in tier to go land on that freaking postage stamp if you hold

2164
02:18:08.46 --> 02:18:11.02
life to be the most precious thing.

2165
02:18:11.02 --> 02:18:13.02
There's something else there, right?

2166
02:18:13.02 --> 02:18:14.86
There's something, you don't do that.

2167
02:18:14.86 --> 02:18:16.58
You just don't do that.

2168
02:18:16.58 --> 02:18:21.78
And that's what I like about this top gun mentality.

2169
02:18:21.78 --> 02:18:23.14
And I'll call the top gun mentality.

2170
02:18:23.14 --> 02:18:31.90
I'll call it the idea that I talked about earlier, this extreme ownership mentality

2171
02:18:31.90 --> 02:18:35.98
of like, hey, I'm going to go and make this happen.

2172
02:18:35.98 --> 02:18:40.70
And when it goes wrong, I'm going to figure it out and I'm going to fix it.

2173
02:18:40.70 --> 02:18:47.46
There's a certain breed of human that tend in that direction.

2174
02:18:47.46 --> 02:18:51.74
And you can, because otherwise, I mean, let's face it.

2175
02:18:51.74 --> 02:18:59.58
You talking about landing on a carrier at night, there is a massive swath of human beings

2176
02:18:59.58 --> 02:19:06.22
that there's no way in hell they ever want to do what you just talked about.

2177
02:19:06.22 --> 02:19:11.06
Echo, what is your, are you fired up to go do a carrier landing right now?

2178
02:19:11.06 --> 02:19:12.06
No, not at this time.

2179
02:19:12.06 --> 02:19:13.06
Thank you.

2180
02:19:13.06 --> 02:19:14.06
Not at zero zero zero.

2181
02:19:14.06 --> 02:19:15.06
What about nighttime?

2182
02:19:15.06 --> 02:19:16.06
What about?

2183
02:19:16.06 --> 02:19:17.06
No, what about?

2184
02:19:17.06 --> 02:19:21.70
What about day after day after night after night after night after night after night?

2185
02:19:21.70 --> 02:19:22.70
Right.

2186
02:19:22.70 --> 02:19:28.94
So we're talking about a different, you know, a different kind of human with a different mentality.

2187
02:19:28.94 --> 02:19:37.02
And what we've done is set up this process that finds those humans that gets them to that

2188
02:19:37.02 --> 02:19:47.14
point where they do that for 25 years, for 25 years, that's how we're doing this.

2189
02:19:47.14 --> 02:19:49.14
That's pretty impressive.

2190
02:19:49.14 --> 02:19:50.14
Yeah.

2191
02:19:50.14 --> 02:19:56.58
So I got, I had a couple more things I want to ask.

2192
02:19:56.58 --> 02:19:57.74
Flexible for, is that what it's called?

2193
02:19:57.74 --> 02:19:59.94
The flexible for, what's the fluid for?

2194
02:19:59.94 --> 02:20:00.94
The fluid for.

2195
02:20:00.94 --> 02:20:01.94
Yeah, that's what I mean.

2196
02:20:01.94 --> 02:20:04.82
What we're in a formation, we work together.

2197
02:20:04.82 --> 02:20:07.90
It sounded like there's a lot more regimented than it was fluid.

2198
02:20:07.90 --> 02:20:08.90
Yeah.

2199
02:20:08.90 --> 02:20:09.90
Fluid for is not a fluid formation.

2200
02:20:09.90 --> 02:20:11.14
Does anyone use it anymore?

2201
02:20:11.14 --> 02:20:15.10
Yeah, we use it to kind of navigate to and from the space other than that it's not

2202
02:20:15.10 --> 02:20:16.10
to have.

2203
02:20:16.10 --> 02:20:17.10
It's not a tactical thing at all.

2204
02:20:17.10 --> 02:20:19.26
You do it just to keep people close together.

2205
02:20:19.26 --> 02:20:21.66
So you say, hey, we're going to go from point to point B and I don't want to mess around

2206
02:20:21.66 --> 02:20:25.26
just kind of get close to moving to fluid for out there.

2207
02:20:25.26 --> 02:20:27.50
I sent you a text.

2208
02:20:27.50 --> 02:20:30.22
I said, loose doos.

2209
02:20:30.22 --> 02:20:31.58
I said, loose doos.

2210
02:20:31.58 --> 02:20:34.46
It equals.

2211
02:20:34.46 --> 02:20:35.46
Cover and move.

2212
02:20:35.46 --> 02:20:39.90
Plus decentralized command over and you're like Roger makes sense.

2213
02:20:39.90 --> 02:20:40.90
Yeah, that's exactly right.

2214
02:20:40.90 --> 02:20:47.82
Yeah, because it'll lose goose formation or sorry, loose doos formation.

2215
02:20:47.82 --> 02:20:51.90
You do one of us can take lead.

2216
02:20:51.90 --> 02:20:57.62
We can take lead and we can make things happen on our own and yet we have to cover for each

2217
02:20:57.62 --> 02:20:58.62
other.

2218
02:20:58.62 --> 02:20:59.62
Yeah, if we don't work together, we're going to die.

2219
02:20:59.62 --> 02:21:00.62
That's right.

2220
02:21:00.62 --> 02:21:01.62
That's exactly right.

2221
02:21:01.62 --> 02:21:07.50
I can direct you to do something that I need you to do and when you don't comply,

2222
02:21:07.50 --> 02:21:09.86
I know that it's because you can't.

2223
02:21:09.86 --> 02:21:11.78
And so there's this relationship piece.

2224
02:21:11.78 --> 02:21:15.06
There's all those components that you just talked about are inside there and that's how

2225
02:21:15.06 --> 02:21:19.82
you're going to work together to eventually isolate the bad guy and one of us is going

2226
02:21:19.82 --> 02:21:22.38
to kill him and I don't really care who does it as long as one of us does it.

2227
02:21:22.38 --> 02:21:25.86
And if that means I got to stay engaged the whole time that you get the kill, it's good

2228
02:21:25.86 --> 02:21:31.26
by me because we're good and we move on.

2229
02:21:31.26 --> 02:21:32.94
These guys figured that out, right?

2230
02:21:32.94 --> 02:21:37.14
These guys figured that these guys said the other way doesn't work.

2231
02:21:37.14 --> 02:21:38.58
This way works better.

2232
02:21:38.58 --> 02:21:44.62
This is again, you have to have some element of rebel mentality in your brain in order

2233
02:21:44.62 --> 02:21:46.86
to say, you know what?

2234
02:21:46.86 --> 02:21:50.42
It's the same thing with a jujitsu, right?

2235
02:21:50.42 --> 02:21:56.98
Someone's got to say, listen, I don't really believe that if you do this cotta to me,

2236
02:21:56.98 --> 02:21:59.90
that it's going to work, somebody's got to say that.

2237
02:21:59.90 --> 02:22:05.06
In the teams, the biggest, this happened to us in the teams.

2238
02:22:05.06 --> 02:22:08.66
We were using, we'd use real ammunition, we chewed at paper targets and you went every

2239
02:22:08.66 --> 02:22:14.22
single time and you go through the house and every target is dead and they didn't

2240
02:22:14.22 --> 02:22:17.58
maneuver you, they didn't fire on you and they don't maneuver.

2241
02:22:17.58 --> 02:22:18.86
So it becomes so easy.

2242
02:22:18.86 --> 02:22:23.34
When we brought in laser tag, we brought in paintball and simunition and these things that

2243
02:22:23.34 --> 02:22:29.14
allowed us to fight each other, even then somebody had to have the mentality.

2244
02:22:29.14 --> 02:22:30.50
Number one to say, you know what?

2245
02:22:30.50 --> 02:22:32.98
First of all, we should try these tactics on each other because we've been being told

2246
02:22:32.98 --> 02:22:33.98
over and over again.

2247
02:22:33.98 --> 02:22:37.26
I got told that from my first 10 years in the teams, eight years in the teams.

2248
02:22:37.26 --> 02:22:38.66
Hey, this is what works.

2249
02:22:38.66 --> 02:22:39.66
You know what you say?

2250
02:22:39.66 --> 02:22:40.66
Roger that.

2251
02:22:40.66 --> 02:22:41.66
Roger that.

2252
02:22:41.66 --> 02:22:43.06
To say, you know what?

2253
02:22:43.06 --> 02:22:44.06
We need to check this.

2254
02:22:44.06 --> 02:22:45.06
We need to test it.

2255
02:22:45.06 --> 02:22:46.06
You know what?

2256
02:22:46.06 --> 02:22:54.02
There was people that when paintball, when paintball revealed the shortfalls of our tactics,

2257
02:22:54.02 --> 02:22:58.34
there was people that said, yeah, but, yeah, but, you know, it's only paint.

2258
02:22:58.34 --> 02:22:59.90
So it's, oh, yeah, but it's not a real weapon.

2259
02:22:59.90 --> 02:23:02.50
Yeah, but there's a different in the penetration.

2260
02:23:02.50 --> 02:23:04.82
There's all kinds of yell butts.

2261
02:23:04.82 --> 02:23:10.38
The rebels said, yeah, you're saying, yeah, but guess what?

2262
02:23:10.38 --> 02:23:17.82
It's just pointed a paintball gun down the hallway and, you know, 13 out of 16 of us got hit

2263
02:23:17.82 --> 02:23:19.82
with paintball.

2264
02:23:19.82 --> 02:23:21.90
That doesn't seem good.

2265
02:23:21.90 --> 02:23:27.02
And there was people that were saying, yeah, but, yeah, but it's not an AK 47.

2266
02:23:27.02 --> 02:23:29.74
A-K 47 only holds 30 rounds of paintball gun.

2267
02:23:29.74 --> 02:23:31.14
It has a hopper with 100 rounds.

2268
02:23:31.14 --> 02:23:32.14
That's not realistic.

2269
02:23:32.14 --> 02:23:37.74
Okay, what if they had a freaking, I told them, any kind of machine gun?

2270
02:23:37.74 --> 02:23:43.26
So you have to employ this rebel mentality.

2271
02:23:43.26 --> 02:23:45.74
And that's why you get, you know, that's where you get these crazy top gun stories.

2272
02:23:45.74 --> 02:23:48.34
That's why they're stealing a trailer to set up shop.

2273
02:23:48.34 --> 02:23:53.50
But the seal teams has tracet's whole history back to that kind of rebel behavior.

2274
02:23:53.50 --> 02:23:56.10
There is a, and that's what shocked me.

2275
02:23:56.10 --> 02:23:58.82
And it shocked me, but that's what was so amazing.

2276
02:23:58.82 --> 02:24:05.14
When Dan was like, hey, he's the OIC and he says, we are going to be the most professional

2277
02:24:05.14 --> 02:24:08.70
humans that these pilots have ever talked to.

2278
02:24:08.70 --> 02:24:09.70
We're going to brief these things.

2279
02:24:09.70 --> 02:24:10.70
We're going to murder board each other.

2280
02:24:10.70 --> 02:24:13.06
We're going to be in the perfect uniform.

2281
02:24:13.06 --> 02:24:15.78
They're talking about uniforms.

2282
02:24:15.78 --> 02:24:18.82
This attitude of we're going to be rebellious.

2283
02:24:18.82 --> 02:24:20.78
We're going to, we're going to make sure things work.

2284
02:24:20.78 --> 02:24:26.06
And at the same time, we're going to be, we're going to be above board across the board

2285
02:24:26.06 --> 02:24:27.30
and everything else.

2286
02:24:27.30 --> 02:24:32.54
So that when we step out and say, hey, this is wrong, people will actually listen.

2287
02:24:32.54 --> 02:24:34.90
That is a rare thing.

2288
02:24:34.90 --> 02:24:42.02
It's a rare thing to know that you have to hold the line, toe the line, be above board

2289
02:24:42.02 --> 02:24:43.42
across the board.

2290
02:24:43.42 --> 02:24:47.78
And then at the same time know that when something's not quite right, you've got to

2291
02:24:47.78 --> 02:24:50.42
be a rebel at heart.

2292
02:24:50.42 --> 02:24:52.30
Top gun mentality.

2293
02:24:52.30 --> 02:24:53.30
Yeah, man.

2294
02:24:53.30 --> 02:24:58.30
It's solid.

2295
02:24:58.30 --> 02:25:04.86
And, and have that legacy persist and to be able to cultivate it in a way that

2296
02:25:04.86 --> 02:25:07.94
has evolved and changed a whole bunch.

2297
02:25:07.94 --> 02:25:11.86
We're not dealing with the same problems that the original bros are dealing with

2298
02:25:11.86 --> 02:25:13.26
back in the late 60s.

2299
02:25:13.26 --> 02:25:14.26
We're not losing in the end.

2300
02:25:14.26 --> 02:25:17.58
We're not dealing, but we actually have to do the same thing.

2301
02:25:17.58 --> 02:25:23.70
And what that mentality now is fighting against the complacency that comes with the things

2302
02:25:23.70 --> 02:25:27.30
that we've been able to do so well for so long.

2303
02:25:27.30 --> 02:25:30.50
And happy will say, hey, listen, I know this has worked for a long time.

2304
02:25:30.50 --> 02:25:32.82
And I know this has been the best way to do it.

2305
02:25:32.82 --> 02:25:36.06
And it's not going to keep working like this because the people we're fighting against

2306
02:25:36.06 --> 02:25:37.34
are going to figure this out.

2307
02:25:37.34 --> 02:25:38.90
They're going to build a new machine.

2308
02:25:38.90 --> 02:25:40.18
They're going to build some countermeasure.

2309
02:25:40.18 --> 02:25:42.90
They're going to do something that keeps us from working.

2310
02:25:42.90 --> 02:25:47.42
And we act to have to be everybody's creative and that tell the entire institution what

2311
02:25:47.42 --> 02:25:49.18
we're doing won't work anymore.

2312
02:25:49.18 --> 02:25:51.82
And figure it away to get the institution.

2313
02:25:51.82 --> 02:25:56.10
This giant behemoth institution to listen to you.

2314
02:25:56.10 --> 02:26:08.10
None of that happens ever unless you as a leader, as a team member, stay humble.

2315
02:26:08.10 --> 02:26:11.82
If you don't stay humble, I can't even imagine.

2316
02:26:11.82 --> 02:26:15.30
Like I know what you're going into this seal training.

2317
02:26:15.30 --> 02:26:17.86
And it's the boasting, training, and you.

2318
02:26:17.86 --> 02:26:25.82
The video, the recruiting video that I watched, the title of the video was be someone special.

2319
02:26:25.82 --> 02:26:29.26
That's the title of the video to try and get you to go in there.

2320
02:26:29.26 --> 02:26:31.74
So you're getting told your special whole time.

2321
02:26:31.74 --> 02:26:34.06
Top Guns got to be 10 times worse.

2322
02:26:34.06 --> 02:26:38.46
On top of that, you add the freaking, you know, Maverick and Viper and Ice Man.

2323
02:26:38.46 --> 02:26:44.38
I mean, we're talking, you're just, this is an ego booster rocket.

2324
02:26:44.38 --> 02:26:48.46
And to have that ego booster rocket.

2325
02:26:48.46 --> 02:26:55.58
And yet, you know, throw out the sea anchor to keep you grounded, to keep you down to earth,

2326
02:26:55.58 --> 02:26:57.34
to keep you humble.

2327
02:26:57.34 --> 02:27:02.90
That is the last part of this top gun mentality.

2328
02:27:02.90 --> 02:27:14.10
That's allowed us, you know, allowed the allies of America are air forces around the world

2329
02:27:14.10 --> 02:27:16.50
to be the best and continue to be the best.

2330
02:27:16.50 --> 02:27:19.54
And you have to have all those elements.

2331
02:27:19.54 --> 02:27:24.82
And what's awesome is if you have these elements, these elements do not only apply

2332
02:27:24.82 --> 02:27:30.94
to fight or fly an aircraft, they apply to being in a seal but to being in an infantry company,

2333
02:27:30.94 --> 02:27:37.70
they apply to being on the GJ2 mats, they apply to every, to be in a part of a family,

2334
02:27:37.70 --> 02:27:40.74
part of a team, part of anything.

2335
02:27:40.74 --> 02:27:50.26
These aspects will make you win in the end.

2336
02:27:50.26 --> 02:27:51.26
Two and a half hours.

2337
02:27:51.26 --> 02:27:54.66
Dave, did I miss anything?

2338
02:27:54.66 --> 02:27:56.30
No, man, that was awesome.

2339
02:27:56.30 --> 02:28:02.70
There's probably a bunch of other things that you could get me talking about.

2340
02:28:02.70 --> 02:28:06.42
The mentality that you talked about at the end, I think, for me is the most important thing.

2341
02:28:06.42 --> 02:28:07.42
For sure.

2342
02:28:07.42 --> 02:28:11.82
And that's to finish with that and to have that be the thing that persists in the legacy

2343
02:28:11.82 --> 02:28:17.18
of top gun and have nothing to do with Hollywood or any of those things, but the legacy

2344
02:28:17.18 --> 02:28:23.26
of people who took that burden of responsibility of I'm responsible for people's lives

2345
02:28:23.26 --> 02:28:27.82
who are going to go out and lead junior pilots out into combat and turn that into something

2346
02:28:27.82 --> 02:28:33.34
that becomes in organization that's lasted for decades.

2347
02:28:33.34 --> 02:28:38.86
I mean, what Yank was able to do in the face of more organization resistors than I've

2348
02:28:38.86 --> 02:28:39.86
ever faced.

2349
02:28:39.86 --> 02:28:44.14
I didn't face a big Navy or big Marine Corps telling me no all the time.

2350
02:28:44.14 --> 02:28:47.58
I didn't grow up in that Marine Corps.

2351
02:28:47.58 --> 02:28:52.90
And I said this last time, but to be a small link in that long chain, I had a harder

2352
02:28:52.90 --> 02:28:58.82
time reading this book personally because it was so easy to connect.

2353
02:28:58.82 --> 02:29:03.94
I was so inside, I read this book and understood so much of it that a hard time seeing

2354
02:29:03.94 --> 02:29:04.94
it.

2355
02:29:04.94 --> 02:29:06.50
You actually even talked about a little bit of, hey, what?

2356
02:29:06.50 --> 02:29:09.82
Like I was missing components of that because I was on the inside, talking about it

2357
02:29:09.82 --> 02:29:14.70
with him last week and then coming back here again on today has helped me detach even more

2358
02:29:14.70 --> 02:29:21.54
to see even what I did at top gun awhile I was there that didn't understand quite that

2359
02:29:21.54 --> 02:29:24.50
level because I was inside of it.

2360
02:29:24.50 --> 02:29:30.30
And the story is incredible, but it's the persistence of that mentality that is how you

2361
02:29:30.30 --> 02:29:37.94
win everywhere connected back to the attribute that has been my biggest challenge and by

2362
02:29:37.94 --> 02:29:41.82
far the thing that has mattered the most in my life, which is humility, to learn it

2363
02:29:41.82 --> 02:29:47.10
in a place at Top Gun where people are telling you that you're the best of the best.

2364
02:29:47.10 --> 02:29:48.74
That is the phrase against them all the time.

2365
02:29:48.74 --> 02:29:54.82
The best of the best, there's a difference between humility and showmanship, there's

2366
02:29:54.82 --> 02:29:59.10
plenty of showmanship up there, you used to talk about the current regretter all the time,

2367
02:29:59.10 --> 02:30:05.54
but there is so much humility inside that organization because of the burden and the responsibility

2368
02:30:05.54 --> 02:30:09.54
they feel that it's cool to come from a circle from the beginning of this conversation

2369
02:30:09.54 --> 02:30:13.58
was I learned more about humility at Top Gun than anywhere else because it was the thing

2370
02:30:13.58 --> 02:30:17.06
that I was required the most for me to actually be successful there.

2371
02:30:17.06 --> 02:30:25.34
And Yank and the original bros, they deserve a lot of credit for creating that.

2372
02:30:25.34 --> 02:30:30.42
No doubt, and it's also amazing that when you trace back the history of the seal teams

2373
02:30:30.42 --> 02:30:36.78
and the way they were formed and the way they learned and the attitude, it's the same traits,

2374
02:30:36.78 --> 02:30:43.90
it's the same traits that we talk about all the time, this is what it takes to win.

2375
02:30:43.90 --> 02:30:46.78
With that, echo trolls.

2376
02:30:46.78 --> 02:30:48.78
Yes.

2377
02:30:48.78 --> 02:30:56.02
Do you have any suggestions on how we can employ the Top Gun mentality in our own lives?

2378
02:30:56.02 --> 02:31:01.66
Yeah, sure, but first I have a question for good deal date.

2379
02:31:01.66 --> 02:31:06.82
So back to the, because it's kind of come back to the Dodd-finding situation of scenario

2380
02:31:06.82 --> 02:31:11.66
one, maybe to scenario one, the one where, you're going way back.

2381
02:31:11.66 --> 02:31:13.30
Yeah, because let's face it.

2382
02:31:13.30 --> 02:31:18.06
That wasn't as cut and dry straight forward as far as understanding it goes.

2383
02:31:18.06 --> 02:31:19.82
It was just hard to track.

2384
02:31:19.82 --> 02:31:21.34
Yeah, a little bit, right?

2385
02:31:21.34 --> 02:31:28.02
So, okay, so you're trying to close the distance as the, the guy on the offender.

2386
02:31:28.02 --> 02:31:30.02
No, defense is okay, yeah.

2387
02:31:30.02 --> 02:31:31.02
Okay, yeah.

2388
02:31:31.02 --> 02:31:32.90
You got it, I try it.

2389
02:31:32.90 --> 02:31:38.62
So yeah, because it's confusing because usually like in Juditzer fighting, the offender wants

2390
02:31:38.62 --> 02:31:41.06
to go, if you're just in fighting, you want to close the distance.

2391
02:31:41.06 --> 02:31:42.06
Yes.

2392
02:31:42.06 --> 02:31:43.06
Yes.

2393
02:31:43.06 --> 02:31:46.82
So that outside green zone is not available in the scenario, but it is still available

2394
02:31:46.82 --> 02:31:50.06
in the whole kind of scope of fighting.

2395
02:31:50.06 --> 02:31:58.10
Okay, you said that you don't do like a, like a, like a joker or like a faint or anything

2396
02:31:58.10 --> 02:32:02.66
like that, you know, go one way and then break right or whatever.

2397
02:32:02.66 --> 02:32:07.70
Is there any version of a faint in dog fighting at all?

2398
02:32:07.70 --> 02:32:12.30
Well, one to be, you do a break and then you do a ditch.

2399
02:32:12.30 --> 02:32:14.54
And then you do another break and then you do another ditch?

2400
02:32:14.54 --> 02:32:21.78
No, I would not equate, I, I did not explain it well enough to have it in your, in your mind,

2401
02:32:21.78 --> 02:32:27.90
see it clearly enough, but the break and the ditch are too exclusive things.

2402
02:32:27.90 --> 02:32:33.10
And the simplest way to answer that is, is no.

2403
02:32:33.10 --> 02:32:36.78
Because if you're fighting against opponent and opponent who recognizes that that's

2404
02:32:36.78 --> 02:32:41.86
a faint, what a faint would do if you move to one direction to set up a movement in another

2405
02:32:41.86 --> 02:32:47.98
direction is that you're giving him the separation that he wants to attack you.

2406
02:32:47.98 --> 02:32:51.98
And part of what might be confusing about this is that, you know, we started with this

2407
02:32:51.98 --> 02:32:55.78
one against one, which is a very canned set up that we're starting in a mile or whatever

2408
02:32:55.78 --> 02:32:58.58
that might be, you know, that that six thousand feet.

2409
02:32:58.58 --> 02:33:04.42
It has an account for all the things that have gotten to that point, but that mile is actually

2410
02:33:04.42 --> 02:33:08.18
the optimal separation for an attacker to get.

2411
02:33:08.18 --> 02:33:12.86
So if you were in whatever the optimal position between you and somebody else in Gigi,

2412
02:33:12.86 --> 02:33:17.10
for you to be successful as the person in the offensive advantage, that's a mile.

2413
02:33:17.10 --> 02:33:20.46
So if you can kind of equate, if you were to just show me exactly how you'd want to

2414
02:33:20.46 --> 02:33:25.06
position yourself against someone else, you know, you're taking his back, you've kind

2415
02:33:25.06 --> 02:33:29.70
of started to set up the rear naked or whatever that might be, whatever that separation

2416
02:33:29.70 --> 02:33:34.82
is, that's not the same separation as if someone in the mouth pulled you and kind of

2417
02:33:34.82 --> 02:33:38.02
grabbed you and pulled you close him so you couldn't strike them.

2418
02:33:38.02 --> 02:33:44.78
So that start of you being behind him is that start of that position and if I kind

2419
02:33:44.78 --> 02:33:49.18
of fainted or kind of hinted at I was going to move in one direction to stop the choke

2420
02:33:49.18 --> 02:33:51.26
and I opened up my neck to do it.

2421
02:33:51.26 --> 02:33:56.34
The guy you're fighting is going to laugh at that faint because all you did was open up

2422
02:33:56.34 --> 02:34:00.98
your neck and he's good enough and fast enough to take advantage of that, that what you're

2423
02:34:00.98 --> 02:34:03.66
doing is giving him more positional advantage and you already have.

2424
02:34:03.66 --> 02:34:09.94
Yeah, totally understand now because I think it's natural when we're not fighter pilots

2425
02:34:09.94 --> 02:34:16.90
to think, oh yeah, the defender, right, the guy who's in front or whatever, we think

2426
02:34:16.90 --> 02:34:21.14
of that is like, why doesn't he just get away, right?

2427
02:34:21.14 --> 02:34:24.62
Or why doesn't he, you know, why don't you just do a move here and fake them out and get

2428
02:34:24.62 --> 02:34:26.26
away, but it's not that.

2429
02:34:26.26 --> 02:34:31.98
It's like the offender, the offensive guys, just kind of trying to keep you at a certain

2430
02:34:31.98 --> 02:34:32.98
range, right?

2431
02:34:32.98 --> 02:34:35.74
Like that's essentially his goal.

2432
02:34:35.74 --> 02:34:40.50
It's not to follow you everywhere, you know, like a high speed car chase or something.

2433
02:34:40.50 --> 02:34:42.66
It's like to keep you in that range the whole time.

2434
02:34:42.66 --> 02:34:45.94
So if you compare to the jujitsu, right, you know how like we have situational training,

2435
02:34:45.94 --> 02:34:49.62
which is essentially what it is, right, situational training.

2436
02:34:49.62 --> 02:34:57.06
So if you start on my back, jaco, I'm the defender, it's essentially the same thing.

2437
02:34:57.06 --> 02:34:58.46
I'm the defender.

2438
02:34:58.46 --> 02:35:03.82
And you hold me, I hold you tight.

2439
02:35:03.82 --> 02:35:07.74
Like I'm holding your hands instead of like I got one hand here, one hand here, I'm holding

2440
02:35:07.74 --> 02:35:09.62
you tight, you can't like maneuver it all.

2441
02:35:09.62 --> 02:35:12.62
I'm so tight, everything is just so tight.

2442
02:35:12.62 --> 02:35:18.06
You want to get me in a range that essentially you can choke me, right?

2443
02:35:18.06 --> 02:35:21.18
So or actually a better one is side control, you know?

2444
02:35:21.18 --> 02:35:23.38
I think I have it.

2445
02:35:23.38 --> 02:35:24.38
I think I have it.

2446
02:35:24.38 --> 02:35:27.50
I think I figured out what's going on here.

2447
02:35:27.50 --> 02:35:33.66
You've heard me say in jujitsu that if I'm going to fake a move, if I'm going to faint

2448
02:35:33.66 --> 02:35:41.74
to move, I actually have to faint the move enough that you have to react to it.

2449
02:35:41.74 --> 02:35:42.74
Right?

2450
02:35:42.74 --> 02:35:51.98
I can't just fake the sweep and expect you to react because if you, if I fake the sweep

2451
02:35:51.98 --> 02:35:57.14
and you know it's a fake sweep, you just pass my guard or you take advantage of my

2452
02:35:57.14 --> 02:35:59.34
fake or you don't fall for it at all.

2453
02:35:59.34 --> 02:36:06.42
I think because of the, because of the reaction of an aircraft, if you're going to fake

2454
02:36:06.42 --> 02:36:14.86
enough that I'm going to actually have to fall for your fake, for you to recover back

2455
02:36:14.86 --> 02:36:20.74
is you can't do it quickly enough and I am going to be able to take advantage of it.

2456
02:36:20.74 --> 02:36:27.50
So you can't, it's not possible to throw a fake that's committed.

2457
02:36:27.50 --> 02:36:34.46
Like when you commit, the hands down, the best thing you can do is commit to that move

2458
02:36:34.46 --> 02:36:38.82
and that is the hardest thing for me to track is that an accurate assessment.

2459
02:36:38.82 --> 02:36:39.82
Yes.

2460
02:36:39.82 --> 02:36:42.66
And that took me so long to figure out.

2461
02:36:42.66 --> 02:36:45.66
It took me this entire conversation to figure out that.

2462
02:36:45.66 --> 02:36:46.66
Yes.

2463
02:36:46.66 --> 02:36:49.06
So like in jujitsu, they're not really been faint.

2464
02:36:49.06 --> 02:36:51.10
They're essentially just chaining moves together.

2465
02:36:51.10 --> 02:36:54.74
I'm going to do this movement when he reacts to this move that I'm doing, not a fake one,

2466
02:36:54.74 --> 02:36:56.74
a real one when he reacts and I can do it.

2467
02:36:56.74 --> 02:36:57.74
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2468
02:36:57.74 --> 02:36:59.62
And let's face it.

2469
02:36:59.62 --> 02:37:05.10
If you do a real move in jujitsu and the person doesn't react to it, you just get the

2470
02:37:05.10 --> 02:37:06.10
move.

2471
02:37:06.10 --> 02:37:09.46
So that's what they're saying here is you're doing the move.

2472
02:37:09.46 --> 02:37:13.06
And if the person doesn't react to it, cool, you win.

2473
02:37:13.06 --> 02:37:17.14
If they do react to it, you go to the next move in the chain, just like you would in

2474
02:37:17.14 --> 02:37:18.14
jujitsu.

2475
02:37:18.14 --> 02:37:20.06
Yeah, exactly.

2476
02:37:20.06 --> 02:37:26.78
So you've ever been, again, someone where you get side-mount on them and they hold you

2477
02:37:26.78 --> 02:37:28.50
really, really tight.

2478
02:37:28.50 --> 02:37:31.18
Like, just new guys, I think, do it out of panic.

2479
02:37:31.18 --> 02:37:35.18
But if you get a strategic guy, like some of the graces will do this, where they'll hold you.

2480
02:37:35.18 --> 02:37:37.78
Because if you're too tight, you can't do any submission.

2481
02:37:37.78 --> 02:37:40.54
You need a little bit of space.

2482
02:37:40.54 --> 02:37:42.46
So it's essentially that, right?

2483
02:37:42.46 --> 02:37:44.82
Where the defender, he's holding you tight.

2484
02:37:44.82 --> 02:37:45.82
That's what he wants.

2485
02:37:45.82 --> 02:37:46.82
He wants a hold you tight.

2486
02:37:46.82 --> 02:37:47.82
You don't start off tight.

2487
02:37:47.82 --> 02:37:50.10
That's how he can kind of defeat your attacks.

2488
02:37:50.10 --> 02:37:52.38
Because you're out of range of attack, right?

2489
02:37:52.38 --> 02:37:57.98
So I think it's just a misconception where outsiders, people who are not pilots or whatever,

2490
02:37:57.98 --> 02:38:01.42
they look at top gun and they're like, yeah, you just shoot the guy, that's how you win.

2491
02:38:01.42 --> 02:38:02.42
You know, kind of thing.

2492
02:38:02.42 --> 02:38:04.30
But it's to know you got to keep them in that range.

2493
02:38:04.30 --> 02:38:11.26
And then, yeah, if you can find the correct jujitsu scenario, that's similar, then it becomes

2494
02:38:11.26 --> 02:38:12.26
easier to understand.

2495
02:38:12.26 --> 02:38:13.66
Because I wasn't understanding at all.

2496
02:38:13.66 --> 02:38:14.66
It's like, fraud.

2497
02:38:14.66 --> 02:38:17.50
That doesn't even, like, why doesn't this guy do it?

2498
02:38:17.50 --> 02:38:20.02
But then, yeah, after a while, I think I got it.

2499
02:38:20.02 --> 02:38:21.62
I think I'm ready.

2500
02:38:21.62 --> 02:38:22.42
Let's go up the top gun.

2501
02:38:22.42 --> 02:38:23.42
Ready for top gun.

2502
02:38:23.42 --> 02:38:24.42
Yeah.

2503
02:38:24.42 --> 02:38:25.42
Thanks.

2504
02:38:25.42 --> 02:38:26.42
Cheers.

2505
02:38:26.42 --> 02:38:32.70
Speaking of top gun, we do want to be capable.

2506
02:38:32.70 --> 02:38:38.10
As capable as we can, we don't all have 2030 vision, which one is the good vision?

2507
02:38:38.10 --> 02:38:41.10
2030 or 30, 20, 25.

2508
02:38:41.10 --> 02:38:42.10
Yeah.

2509
02:38:42.10 --> 02:38:43.10
25, that's the dope one.

2510
02:38:43.10 --> 02:38:45.38
So when you sign with the number, super humans.

2511
02:38:45.38 --> 02:38:48.82
Yeah.

2512
02:38:48.82 --> 02:38:51.50
Second number is the low number.

2513
02:38:51.50 --> 02:38:51.50
So 2020 means at 20 feet.

2514
02:38:51.50 --> 02:38:53.78
The object appears like it's 20 feet away.

2515
02:38:53.78 --> 02:38:55.34
That's normal.

2516
02:38:55.34 --> 02:38:56.46
2030 means at 20 feet.

2517
02:38:56.46 --> 02:38:58.02
The object appears like it's 30 feet away.

2518
02:38:58.02 --> 02:38:59.18
It's fighter pilots.

2519
02:38:59.18 --> 02:39:01.70
Some fighter pilots out there, they got 2010 vision.

2520
02:39:01.70 --> 02:39:03.34
They see it as if they're 10 feet close.

2521
02:39:03.34 --> 02:39:05.62
So that's how good their eyes are.

2522
02:39:05.62 --> 02:39:11.66
My daughter, allegedly, allegedly, they brought other, you know, when she was doing

2523
02:39:11.66 --> 02:39:14.66
the eye, listen, my oldest daughter, they do the eye test.

2524
02:39:14.66 --> 02:39:17.86
The doctor was or whatever the practitioner of was her.

2525
02:39:17.86 --> 02:39:22.70
Hey, everyone come in here and look at this because she was just, it's not only

2526
02:39:22.70 --> 02:39:25.86
s, really good.

2527
02:39:25.86 --> 02:39:29.18
She said 25.

2528
02:39:29.18 --> 02:39:31.06
That seems unrealistic to me.

2529
02:39:31.06 --> 02:39:35.82
But she also kind of gave like a 25 and then she was like 25, 20, 10.

2530
02:39:35.82 --> 02:39:38.18
So maybe it's just 2010.

2531
02:39:38.18 --> 02:39:44.14
But yeah, it's pretty, my dad also had really insane vision.

2532
02:39:44.14 --> 02:39:48.22
Mine was always just, you know, solid.

2533
02:39:48.22 --> 02:39:49.22
So good.

2534
02:39:49.22 --> 02:39:51.02
What did you, was yours?

2535
02:39:51.02 --> 02:39:52.66
So I was better than 2020.

2536
02:39:52.66 --> 02:39:53.66
Yeah.

2537
02:39:53.66 --> 02:39:58.06
So like I was, I would read the 2015 line kind of no factor and I was picking off like

2538
02:39:58.06 --> 02:40:03.46
a couple off the 2010, which is not, not common.

2539
02:40:03.46 --> 02:40:08.18
I mean, not a lot of, I was lucky enough to have a gift of really good vision.

2540
02:40:08.18 --> 02:40:09.18
Yeah.

2541
02:40:09.18 --> 02:40:14.10
I mean, just a met, how stoked were you when you're like, they're like, oh yeah, you're

2542
02:40:14.10 --> 02:40:15.98
like your vision because you want to be a fighter pilot.

2543
02:40:15.98 --> 02:40:17.86
Oh, by the way, this is one of the most important factors.

2544
02:40:17.86 --> 02:40:22.94
Oh, by the way, you happen to have just naturally one in a hundred thousand humans have

2545
02:40:22.94 --> 02:40:24.34
this kind of vision.

2546
02:40:24.34 --> 02:40:29.38
Can you like not become a fighter pilot if your vision is like a, you know, used to be like

2547
02:40:29.38 --> 02:40:30.38
that.

2548
02:40:30.38 --> 02:40:33.18
I guess I'm not there to be like, juck her and go get LASIC and like, as long as he passed,

2549
02:40:33.18 --> 02:40:34.18
physically is good.

2550
02:40:34.18 --> 02:40:38.10
And there's, there's technology and science out there that improves your vision.

2551
02:40:38.10 --> 02:40:40.34
You don't have to be born with it anymore.

2552
02:40:40.34 --> 02:40:44.58
You notice that on the master video, the one that got, the, muster that got canceled

2553
02:40:44.58 --> 02:40:46.18
or land or land to rain.

2554
02:40:46.18 --> 02:40:48.98
You know, they got canceled in the video.

2555
02:40:48.98 --> 02:40:52.70
Put little attributes to each of the team members in yours was the ice test.

2556
02:40:52.70 --> 02:40:53.70
It was real quick.

2557
02:40:53.70 --> 02:40:54.70
Oh, I can notice.

2558
02:40:54.70 --> 02:40:57.38
That's why I saw that.

2559
02:40:57.38 --> 02:40:59.10
You did, you did.

2560
02:40:59.10 --> 02:40:59.70
Pick it off.

2561
02:40:59.70 --> 02:41:00.70
Check that out.

2562
02:41:00.70 --> 02:41:01.70
You can't line.

2563
02:41:01.70 --> 02:41:03.38
Anyway, capability, right?

2564
02:41:03.38 --> 02:41:04.38
All right, you want to be capable.

2565
02:41:04.38 --> 02:41:05.38
You want to stay capable.

2566
02:41:05.38 --> 02:41:08.98
Jockle, few will help you do that.

2567
02:41:08.98 --> 02:41:10.98
Actually, here's the thing.

2568
02:41:10.98 --> 02:41:13.34
All right, look, do you have a perfect diet?

2569
02:41:13.34 --> 02:41:14.78
Do you have a perfect, perfect diet?

2570
02:41:14.78 --> 02:41:15.78
No, I do not.

2571
02:41:15.78 --> 02:41:18.58
I don't know, I'm a perfect diet either.

2572
02:41:18.58 --> 02:41:24.30
So, Jockle, few will food, drink, supplementation.

2573
02:41:24.30 --> 02:41:25.58
Boom.

2574
02:41:25.58 --> 02:41:27.58
All in one.

2575
02:41:27.58 --> 02:41:28.58
So, what do we got?

2576
02:41:28.58 --> 02:41:29.58
Join warfare.

2577
02:41:29.58 --> 02:41:30.74
Super cruel oil for you joins.

2578
02:41:30.74 --> 02:41:32.30
One they go out and they go out.

2579
02:41:32.30 --> 02:41:33.30
And they go out.

2580
02:41:33.30 --> 02:41:34.94
I was like, oh, he's trapped.

2581
02:41:34.94 --> 02:41:35.94
I don't know.

2582
02:41:35.94 --> 02:41:37.18
I don't even think of Echo knows where he's going.

2583
02:41:37.18 --> 02:41:39.18
But then you just maneuvered right out.

2584
02:41:39.18 --> 02:41:42.90
Oh, that was like, you did a little deck transition.

2585
02:41:42.90 --> 02:41:44.74
You're a little bright out and I was pretty impressed.

2586
02:41:44.74 --> 02:41:46.74
Like, what is that a hard break?

2587
02:41:46.74 --> 02:41:47.74
Dictionary.

2588
02:41:47.74 --> 02:41:49.74
Dictionary transition was awesome.

2589
02:41:49.74 --> 02:41:51.78
That's what I'm having right there, right?

2590
02:41:51.78 --> 02:41:52.78
There you go.

2591
02:41:52.78 --> 02:41:55.54
Nonetheless, I'm just trying to explain what we got here.

2592
02:41:55.54 --> 02:41:58.66
What we're taking, what I'm taking, anyway.

2593
02:41:58.66 --> 02:41:59.94
Look, there's just a bit straight up.

2594
02:41:59.94 --> 02:42:01.22
What do you take every day?

2595
02:42:01.22 --> 02:42:02.22
Super cruel oil.

2596
02:42:02.22 --> 02:42:03.22
I ran out of joint warfare.

2597
02:42:03.22 --> 02:42:05.22
Just text, I know.

2598
02:42:05.22 --> 02:42:09.30
I've been working for 20, 20 and that's my excuse.

2599
02:42:09.30 --> 02:42:12.78
But nonetheless, I got a response.

2600
02:42:12.78 --> 02:42:14.14
So that means that.

2601
02:42:14.14 --> 02:42:15.34
So is he fatt-exing?

2602
02:42:15.34 --> 02:42:18.78
I don't go over those details.

2603
02:42:18.78 --> 02:42:19.78
OK.

2604
02:42:19.78 --> 02:42:20.78
So this is a good guy.

2605
02:42:20.78 --> 02:42:25.34
The good thing is we will now get another.

2606
02:42:25.34 --> 02:42:28.34
What is that scientific assessment?

2607
02:42:28.34 --> 02:42:34.02
When you go off joint warfare and you start getting aches and pains,

2608
02:42:34.02 --> 02:42:35.90
which is what happens.

2609
02:42:35.90 --> 02:42:36.54
Yeah.

2610
02:42:36.54 --> 02:42:38.10
So I'm going to take joint warfare.

2611
02:42:38.10 --> 02:42:38.74
Super cruel oil.

2612
02:42:38.74 --> 02:42:39.86
That's the combo.

2613
02:42:39.86 --> 02:42:40.86
That's the combo.

2614
02:42:40.86 --> 02:42:41.86
That's the combo.

2615
02:42:41.86 --> 02:42:43.02
It's anti-oxidant combo right there.

2616
02:42:43.02 --> 02:42:43.86
What do you take?

2617
02:42:43.86 --> 02:42:46.98
I take three joint warfare in the morning, three joint warfare at night, three super

2618
02:42:46.98 --> 02:42:49.66
curl in the morning, three super cruel at night, every day.

2619
02:42:49.66 --> 02:42:53.06
Yeah, I think basically I have to do that, but not night and day.

2620
02:42:53.06 --> 02:42:54.06
Oh, you just do it one.

2621
02:42:54.06 --> 02:42:55.26
One hit, three and three.

2622
02:42:55.26 --> 02:42:56.26
Easy money.

2623
02:42:56.26 --> 02:42:58.10
Discipline, every single day.

2624
02:42:58.10 --> 02:42:59.10
Put it this way.

2625
02:42:59.10 --> 02:43:03.46
Every day that I work out, deep lane, all day.

2626
02:43:03.46 --> 02:43:06.18
It's like an electoral light kind of thing.

2627
02:43:06.18 --> 02:43:08.10
You should take this pre-workout with caffeine.

2628
02:43:08.10 --> 02:43:09.78
Don't even take it anymore.

2629
02:43:09.78 --> 02:43:10.78
Discipline.

2630
02:43:10.78 --> 02:43:12.78
So the powder like discipline.

2631
02:43:12.78 --> 02:43:13.78
Yes, sir.

2632
02:43:13.78 --> 02:43:14.78
What flavor?

2633
02:43:14.78 --> 02:43:17.22
Which are all of them.

2634
02:43:17.22 --> 02:43:18.82
All interchangeable to me because I can't.

2635
02:43:18.82 --> 02:43:20.82
It's a gift you still love that you have.

2636
02:43:20.82 --> 02:43:21.82
You're a good guy.

2637
02:43:21.82 --> 02:43:22.82
Well, you're a good guy.

2638
02:43:22.82 --> 02:43:23.82
You're a good guy.

2639
02:43:23.82 --> 02:43:24.82
You're a good guy.

2640
02:43:24.82 --> 02:43:25.82
So with Christ.

2641
02:43:25.82 --> 02:43:27.82
Christy's is ridiculous.

2642
02:43:27.82 --> 02:43:31.66
Traffic Thunder is my go-to with the cans.

2643
02:43:31.66 --> 02:43:33.54
100% of the Andre cans every day.

2644
02:43:33.54 --> 02:43:35.58
But the discipline powder, 100%.

2645
02:43:35.58 --> 02:43:39.18
Every day that I work out, which is five, sometimes 60s a week.

2646
02:43:39.18 --> 02:43:42.58
Yes, so that's the everyday thing to milk, not every day.

2647
02:43:42.58 --> 02:43:43.58
Oh, really?

2648
02:43:43.58 --> 02:43:45.38
That goes, comes in waves.

2649
02:43:45.38 --> 02:43:48.02
Because you know, sometimes you just, I just don't

2650
02:43:48.02 --> 02:43:49.42
do about the milk and the coconut milk.

2651
02:43:49.42 --> 02:43:50.42
Milk, right?

2652
02:43:50.42 --> 02:43:51.42
Yes, sir.

2653
02:43:51.42 --> 02:43:52.42
That's a big difference.

2654
02:43:52.42 --> 02:43:57.42
Because look, I can't pound a freaking half gallon of milk or whatever.

2655
02:43:57.42 --> 02:44:03.22
I can't pound a big giant, what is it? 20 ounces of milk on an empty stomach.

2656
02:44:03.22 --> 02:44:04.22
It's not optimal.

2657
02:44:04.22 --> 02:44:05.22
It's not optimal.

2658
02:44:05.22 --> 02:44:06.22
It's the way you feel.

2659
02:44:06.22 --> 02:44:07.22
Right.

2660
02:44:07.22 --> 02:44:08.62
You're familiar with this.

2661
02:44:08.62 --> 02:44:13.54
I understand, but you can hammer that coconut milk and it tastes

2662
02:44:13.54 --> 02:44:15.02
your freaking delicious.

2663
02:44:15.02 --> 02:44:16.02
Yeah.

2664
02:44:16.02 --> 02:44:17.02
Delicious.

2665
02:44:17.02 --> 02:44:22.42
Arguably better than regular milk, taste-wise, coconut milk with, we could be there.

2666
02:44:22.42 --> 02:44:23.42
We could be there.

2667
02:44:23.42 --> 02:44:25.06
I know that's our days looking at me like I'm crazy.

2668
02:44:25.06 --> 02:44:26.54
I'm telling you we could be there.

2669
02:44:26.54 --> 02:44:29.14
If you haven't gone, have you gone down the coconut milk, wrote it?

2670
02:44:29.14 --> 02:44:31.26
No, but I'm not a milk guy.

2671
02:44:31.26 --> 02:44:32.26
We do almond milk.

2672
02:44:32.26 --> 02:44:33.26
Okay.

2673
02:44:33.26 --> 02:44:35.46
So you're speaking my language.

2674
02:44:35.46 --> 02:44:40.70
To drink like 20 ounces of milk or I actually sounds like a would be a problem for me.

2675
02:44:40.70 --> 02:44:42.94
I have a drink of regular milk and a long time.

2676
02:44:42.94 --> 02:44:45.30
I do like a night carry your land.

2677
02:44:45.30 --> 02:44:49.46
The bigger issues, barrel on the, what do you mean you don't take it every day?

2678
02:44:49.46 --> 02:44:50.46
What, milk?

2679
02:44:50.46 --> 02:44:51.46
Yeah.

2680
02:44:51.46 --> 02:44:52.46
Yeah.

2681
02:44:52.46 --> 02:44:53.46
It goes in waves.

2682
02:44:53.46 --> 02:44:54.46
Like for, you know, week two weeks or whatever.

2683
02:44:54.46 --> 02:44:57.66
Like if you're, what do you do when you get done with dinner?

2684
02:44:57.66 --> 02:45:00.78
And it was a really good dinner and then you're like, oh yeah, but I want dessert.

2685
02:45:00.78 --> 02:45:03.78
Yeah, but I don't deserve what makes you strong.

2686
02:45:03.78 --> 02:45:07.38
Well, you know, when I'm thinking that, milk train all day.

2687
02:45:07.38 --> 02:45:10.22
But the thing is that feeling comes in waves.

2688
02:45:10.22 --> 02:45:11.78
You see what I mean?

2689
02:45:11.78 --> 02:45:17.18
Anyway, the almond, Dave Dather not relating at all.

2690
02:45:17.18 --> 02:45:20.42
The almond milk, coconut milk, regular milk.

2691
02:45:20.42 --> 02:45:22.10
I like regular, regular milk.

2692
02:45:22.10 --> 02:45:23.74
Straight up, like like it.

2693
02:45:23.74 --> 02:45:26.26
It's like the stomach full stop, whatever.

2694
02:45:26.26 --> 02:45:31.22
I had coconut milk in like, you know, a brand of smoothie before and I was surprised.

2695
02:45:31.22 --> 02:45:32.22
It was surprisingly good.

2696
02:45:32.22 --> 02:45:33.22
Oh, it's good.

2697
02:45:33.22 --> 02:45:38.26
For coming from a dairy milk, kind of milk lover.

2698
02:45:38.26 --> 02:45:39.66
That's something cool.

2699
02:45:39.66 --> 02:45:41.66
All right, so we got that.

2700
02:45:41.66 --> 02:45:44.50
We got Warrior Kid Moal because well, we got Jocquay T.

2701
02:45:44.50 --> 02:45:50.22
We got the cans of Displungal, which I've been partaking into quite a few many today.

2702
02:45:50.22 --> 02:45:54.30
So getting a little crazy with that and part of that reason is just because it freaking

2703
02:45:54.30 --> 02:45:56.70
tastes delicious.

2704
02:45:56.70 --> 02:46:00.14
All these things are available at the vitamin shop.

2705
02:46:00.14 --> 02:46:05.22
So if the vitamin shop's open around you, you can find some of this stuff.

2706
02:46:05.22 --> 02:46:10.02
If not, you can go to originmainme.com.

2707
02:46:10.02 --> 02:46:12.54
You can order it up and we will send it to you.

2708
02:46:12.54 --> 02:46:13.54
Stat.

2709
02:46:13.54 --> 02:46:14.54
Yep, very reliable.

2710
02:46:14.54 --> 02:46:15.54
Cool.

2711
02:46:15.54 --> 02:46:16.54
Stat.

2712
02:46:16.54 --> 02:46:17.54
So the crew is up there.

2713
02:46:17.54 --> 02:46:18.54
Just get an after it.

2714
02:46:18.54 --> 02:46:19.54
Yes.

2715
02:46:19.54 --> 02:46:20.54
All right.

2716
02:46:20.54 --> 02:46:21.54
It's done.

2717
02:46:21.54 --> 02:46:26.22
Also, origin, they also make G's for GJ2 because we are doing GJ2.

2718
02:46:26.22 --> 02:46:28.46
Hey, slow, we got to get back into GJ2.

2719
02:46:28.46 --> 02:46:29.46
Half-do.

2720
02:46:29.46 --> 02:46:30.86
At some point, we have to.

2721
02:46:30.86 --> 02:46:34.90
And I dig it if we're exercising restraint.

2722
02:46:34.90 --> 02:46:37.86
Being a little hesitant, you know, given the current, I dig it.

2723
02:46:37.86 --> 02:46:40.06
But some of us, man, it's kind of-

2724
02:46:40.06 --> 02:46:41.62
Got a corn and train.

2725
02:46:41.62 --> 02:46:43.62
Train with your corn team.

2726
02:46:43.62 --> 02:46:44.62
Yes, sir.

2727
02:46:44.62 --> 02:46:45.62
With your corn team.

2728
02:46:45.62 --> 02:46:46.62
Yes, right.

2729
02:46:46.62 --> 02:46:48.06
And some people getting back into it quicker than others.

2730
02:46:48.06 --> 02:46:50.82
So if you don't have a G, you want to know what the best G is.

2731
02:46:50.82 --> 02:46:51.82
factually.

2732
02:46:51.82 --> 02:46:54.98
Origin, G, pull, made America 100%.

2733
02:46:54.98 --> 02:47:01.16
Also, aside from GJ2, not forgetting about GJ2, but aside from GJ2, we got in addition

2734
02:47:01.16 --> 02:47:02.16
to GJ2.

2735
02:47:02.16 --> 02:47:03.16
Yes.

2736
02:47:03.16 --> 02:47:04.16
Correct.

2737
02:47:04.16 --> 02:47:07.66
In addition to GJ2 G's that are made in America, we have other things.

2738
02:47:07.66 --> 02:47:08.66
Yes, sir.

2739
02:47:08.66 --> 02:47:09.66
That is true.

2740
02:47:09.66 --> 02:47:11.66
Phanam, American denim.

2741
02:47:11.66 --> 02:47:12.66
In the form of genes.

2742
02:47:12.66 --> 02:47:13.66
Yep.

2743
02:47:13.66 --> 02:47:15.02
We all wear genes.

2744
02:47:15.02 --> 02:47:19.62
We all have a quarantine or not.

2745
02:47:19.62 --> 02:47:20.62
We can wear our genes.

2746
02:47:20.62 --> 02:47:24.22
And we can represent, made in America 100%.

2747
02:47:24.22 --> 02:47:26.94
By the way, no big deal, but you can also help rebuild manufacturing in the United States of America.

2748
02:47:26.94 --> 02:47:27.74
Maybe that's important to you.

2749
02:47:27.74 --> 02:47:30.42
I know it's important to me.

2750
02:47:30.42 --> 02:47:32.22
So you might want to get on that train as well.

2751
02:47:32.22 --> 02:47:33.94
Get yourself some origin boots.

2752
02:47:33.94 --> 02:47:34.94
100%.

2753
02:47:34.94 --> 02:47:35.94
Yeah.

2754
02:47:35.94 --> 02:47:41.14
Boots have it as you mentioned last time.

2755
02:47:41.14 --> 02:47:43.14
I was a bit too into housing boots.

2756
02:47:43.14 --> 02:47:44.14
Yes, I do.

2757
02:47:44.14 --> 02:47:45.14
That's a matter of fact.

2758
02:47:45.14 --> 02:47:46.14
I do.

2759
02:47:46.14 --> 02:47:47.14
I don't think I've seen you wearing them.

2760
02:47:47.14 --> 02:47:48.14
Have I?

2761
02:47:48.14 --> 02:47:49.14
Oh, no.

2762
02:47:49.14 --> 02:47:50.14
No, I haven't seen you wearing them.

2763
02:47:50.14 --> 02:47:55.14
I tend to reserve my boot wearing scenarios pretty conservatively.

2764
02:47:55.14 --> 02:47:57.14
You know, so yeah.

2765
02:47:57.14 --> 02:47:58.14
You know, I don't wear them.

2766
02:47:58.14 --> 02:48:04.14
Basically, this is your way of saying we need to make origin slippers or hands.

2767
02:48:04.14 --> 02:48:09.14
And some form of sneakers.

2768
02:48:09.14 --> 02:48:12.14
sneakers, tennis shoes, running shoes, whatever, depending on what part of the world you're

2769
02:48:12.14 --> 02:48:13.14
from.

2770
02:48:13.14 --> 02:48:17.14
sneakers and in Hawaii shoes shoes.

2771
02:48:17.14 --> 02:48:23.14
You know what, I don't know if we were ever familiar with that product, shoes or whatever.

2772
02:48:23.14 --> 02:48:24.14
I don't know.

2773
02:48:24.14 --> 02:48:25.42
Yeah, what I'm still the main land.

2774
02:48:25.42 --> 02:48:27.62
It was like yeah, shoes sneakers.

2775
02:48:27.62 --> 02:48:29.90
We wear slippers, aka flip flops.

2776
02:48:29.90 --> 02:48:30.90
Yeah.

2777
02:48:30.90 --> 02:48:31.90
Or go bare feet.

2778
02:48:31.90 --> 02:48:32.90
100%.

2779
02:48:32.90 --> 02:48:35.90
What do we call in sandals?

2780
02:48:35.90 --> 02:48:36.90
Yeah.

2781
02:48:36.90 --> 02:48:39.10
I call them flip flops.

2782
02:48:39.10 --> 02:48:41.10
Yes.

2783
02:48:41.10 --> 02:48:45.10
To me, sandals means has a strap over the top as a different situation.

2784
02:48:45.10 --> 02:48:52.10
Maybe this is like a guy that lives in Miami that's taking his, you know, his young

2785
02:48:52.10 --> 02:48:57.10
girlfriend and he's like 52 years old and he's taken her out to like an Italian restaurant.

2786
02:48:57.10 --> 02:48:59.10
That guy's wearing sandals, right?

2787
02:48:59.10 --> 02:49:01.10
I'm wearing flip flops.

2788
02:49:01.10 --> 02:49:02.10
Well, right.

2789
02:49:02.10 --> 02:49:07.10
Did I catch maybe is there an origin flip flops scenario brewing here?

2790
02:49:07.10 --> 02:49:10.10
I would not be mad at that scenario.

2791
02:49:10.10 --> 02:49:12.10
Let me put it to you this way.

2792
02:49:12.10 --> 02:49:18.10
I don't want to wear things that aren't made in America at all.

2793
02:49:18.10 --> 02:49:23.10
So yes, and as like you, I wear flip flops pretty much every day.

2794
02:49:23.10 --> 02:49:25.42
So are there some brewing?

2795
02:49:25.42 --> 02:49:28.10
The answer is in the affirmative.

2796
02:49:28.10 --> 02:49:29.10
Jacob.

2797
02:49:29.10 --> 02:49:32.10
Well, I think sandals when this is just how it feels.

2798
02:49:32.10 --> 02:49:35.82
So I don't know technically flip flops sandals.

2799
02:49:35.82 --> 02:49:39.66
If you're referring to flip flops or the ones that you're referring to my homeboy in

2800
02:49:39.66 --> 02:49:41.66
Miami, yeah, well, that's a terrific girlfriend.

2801
02:49:41.66 --> 02:49:45.66
Well, the thing goes between your, your big toe and your second toe.

2802
02:49:45.66 --> 02:49:47.66
You know, they phone songs sometimes.

2803
02:49:47.66 --> 02:49:49.66
Oh, if it goes a term for it.

2804
02:49:49.66 --> 02:49:52.66
If it has that, then yeah, sandals don't they just cover your foot.

2805
02:49:52.66 --> 02:49:53.66
They don't between your toe.

2806
02:49:53.66 --> 02:49:54.66
I don't know.

2807
02:49:54.66 --> 02:49:59.66
That seems like the technique or is it all this stuff and more available at origin

2808
02:49:59.66 --> 02:50:00.66
main.com get some.

2809
02:50:00.66 --> 02:50:01.66
Yes, very true.

2810
02:50:01.66 --> 02:50:03.66
Also, what do we got?

2811
02:50:03.66 --> 02:50:05.66
I think we have a store.

2812
02:50:05.66 --> 02:50:06.66
Yes.

2813
02:50:06.66 --> 02:50:07.66
It's called Jocco Store.

2814
02:50:07.66 --> 02:50:13.66
So you want to continue to represent on the path is where you can get your dysvyn equals

2815
02:50:13.66 --> 02:50:14.66
freedom.

2816
02:50:14.66 --> 02:50:16.66
Good shirts.

2817
02:50:16.66 --> 02:50:18.66
More rash guards.

2818
02:50:18.66 --> 02:50:19.66
Dave Burke.

2819
02:50:19.66 --> 02:50:22.66
Who it is, hats, beanies.

2820
02:50:22.66 --> 02:50:23.66
You know, all this kind of stuff.

2821
02:50:23.66 --> 02:50:25.66
Um, a pair of, we got some posters on there too.

2822
02:50:25.66 --> 02:50:26.66
Oh, yeah.

2823
02:50:26.66 --> 02:50:27.66
Where are you kids stuff as well?

2824
02:50:27.66 --> 02:50:29.66
That's always good.

2825
02:50:29.66 --> 02:50:30.66
Yeah.

2826
02:50:30.66 --> 02:50:31.66
So yeah, JoccoStore.com.

2827
02:50:31.66 --> 02:50:33.66
Go there, you know, get something.

2828
02:50:33.66 --> 02:50:34.66
Represent.

2829
02:50:34.66 --> 02:50:39.66
Well, you're on this path that we're all on.

2830
02:50:39.66 --> 02:50:44.66
Also, you can support this podcast by subscribing to it.

2831
02:50:44.66 --> 02:50:46.66
Subscribe to this podcast.

2832
02:50:46.66 --> 02:50:49.66
And then this podcast called JoccoPonCast.

2833
02:50:49.66 --> 02:50:53.66
We also have another podcast that I'm changing the name of and we'll get it back out there.

2834
02:50:53.66 --> 02:50:57.66
And I'm, we're, we're discussing the, how we're going to actually play that game.

2835
02:50:57.66 --> 02:50:59.66
Or how we're going to do it.

2836
02:50:59.66 --> 02:51:02.66
But so there was a podcast called the thread.

2837
02:51:02.66 --> 02:51:04.66
It will be back under a new name.

2838
02:51:04.66 --> 02:51:11.66
I didn't, I didn't even Google the name when I just named my own new podcast, right?

2839
02:51:11.66 --> 02:51:12.66
This is zero research.

2840
02:51:12.66 --> 02:51:13.66
This is a good name.

2841
02:51:13.66 --> 02:51:15.66
I like it and do it.

2842
02:51:15.66 --> 02:51:18.66
So sometimes I'm a little bit too default.

2843
02:51:18.66 --> 02:51:19.66
A group of rows.

2844
02:51:19.66 --> 02:51:20.66
So I've got to watch out for that.

2845
02:51:20.66 --> 02:51:26.66
Got the grounded podcast where we talk about life through the lens of Jocco or your kid podcast

2846
02:51:26.66 --> 02:51:30.66
for your children and also pretty good for parents to listen to.

2847
02:51:30.66 --> 02:51:33.66
And also get some more of your kids soap available yet.

2848
02:51:33.66 --> 02:51:34.66
Yes.

2849
02:51:34.66 --> 02:51:39.66
Oh, it's available on JoccoStore.com order yourself some killer soap made by young

2850
02:51:39.66 --> 02:51:40.66
Aiden.

2851
02:51:40.66 --> 02:51:45.66
So that you as a human being can stay clean.

2852
02:51:45.66 --> 02:51:49.66
Also not to mention Jocco soap and trooper soap.

2853
02:51:49.66 --> 02:51:50.66
Oh.

2854
02:51:50.66 --> 02:51:51.66
Yeah.

2855
02:51:51.66 --> 02:51:57.66
So the, you know, so sometimes I'm not saying this is what it's for because it's not what it's for.

2856
02:51:57.66 --> 02:52:00.66
But sometimes soap is sort of sitting out.

2857
02:52:00.66 --> 02:52:02.66
It's just sitting out on display.

2858
02:52:02.66 --> 02:52:03.66
We'll call it.

2859
02:52:03.66 --> 02:52:08.66
So we're on the street is the trooper soap in particular gets many, many compliments

2860
02:52:08.66 --> 02:52:10.66
with the aroma.

2861
02:52:10.66 --> 02:52:11.66
Interesting.

2862
02:52:11.66 --> 02:52:12.66
So it smells good is what I'm saying.

2863
02:52:12.66 --> 02:52:13.66
Interesting.

2864
02:52:13.66 --> 02:52:14.66
Yeah.

2865
02:52:14.66 --> 02:52:16.66
I personally like that killer soap.

2866
02:52:16.66 --> 02:52:17.66
Yeah, I like that killer soap.

2867
02:52:17.66 --> 02:52:21.66
But I guess the trooper soap if you want to, you know, let's say it's at night

2868
02:52:21.66 --> 02:52:23.66
time your final shower.

2869
02:52:23.66 --> 02:52:26.66
Are you going to go go sleep with your wife or something like this?

2870
02:52:26.66 --> 02:52:27.66
Maybe use the trooper soap.

2871
02:52:27.66 --> 02:52:28.66
So what I'm saying?

2872
02:52:28.66 --> 02:52:29.66
Interesting.

2873
02:52:29.66 --> 02:52:33.66
Anyway, yes, I really don't have a spoken ranch.com also.

2874
02:52:33.66 --> 02:52:37.66
Joccostore.com boom soap available gets also.

2875
02:52:37.66 --> 02:52:38.66
We have YouTube channel.

2876
02:52:38.66 --> 02:52:42.66
If you're interested in the video version of this podcast, you're going to watch it

2877
02:52:42.66 --> 02:52:43.66
instead of just listen.

2878
02:52:43.66 --> 02:52:49.66
By the way, I posted a video the other day of me making some food with Josh Hall

2879
02:52:49.66 --> 02:52:55.66
and Tory and somebody wrote like the no explosions.

2880
02:52:55.66 --> 02:52:59.66
So I think we kind of owe it to the world.

2881
02:52:59.66 --> 02:53:04.66
Some of the explosions and some, you know, some jocco cooking videos.

2882
02:53:04.66 --> 02:53:07.66
I'm the worst cook.

2883
02:53:07.66 --> 02:53:09.66
Well, you know, some guys are into it.

2884
02:53:09.66 --> 02:53:12.66
You know, it's kind of like a thing like I'm going to grill up.

2885
02:53:12.66 --> 02:53:14.66
Lave babon all the way.

2886
02:53:14.66 --> 02:53:17.66
Lave babon's all about that grill and what do you do with what do you do with it

2887
02:53:17.66 --> 02:53:18.66
before you cook it.

2888
02:53:18.66 --> 02:53:20.66
You leave it in the fridge and some sauce for the night.

2889
02:53:20.66 --> 02:53:21.66
What's that?

2890
02:53:21.66 --> 02:53:22.66
Oh, it's very nice.

2891
02:53:22.66 --> 02:53:23.66
Yep, Mary's Mary's Mary's Mary's.

2892
02:53:23.66 --> 02:53:25.66
I can't get out of the fridge.

2893
02:53:25.66 --> 02:53:26.66
I can't get out of the fridge.

2894
02:53:26.66 --> 02:53:27.66
I can't get out of the fridge.

2895
02:53:27.66 --> 02:53:29.66
Mary's all fired up for that.

2896
02:53:29.66 --> 02:53:31.66
You know what I'll do with food?

2897
02:53:31.66 --> 02:53:32.66
Eat it.

2898
02:53:32.66 --> 02:53:35.66
You know, you can tell if someone's really into cooking.

2899
02:53:35.66 --> 02:53:39.66
When they put salt on it, they don't just put salt like this.

2900
02:53:39.66 --> 02:53:41.66
Or like I see, you know, you put seasoning.

2901
02:53:41.66 --> 02:53:43.66
You know, before it goes in the oven, wherever it goes,

2902
02:53:43.66 --> 02:53:45.66
you know, you just put salt put seasoning.

2903
02:53:45.66 --> 02:53:46.66
This is how you can tell.

2904
02:53:46.66 --> 02:53:47.66
They grab the salt.

2905
02:53:47.66 --> 02:53:51.66
They grab the salt with their fingers and they sprinkle it like in a circle.

2906
02:53:51.66 --> 02:53:54.66
You know, like they have a technique to sprinkle in.

2907
02:53:54.66 --> 02:53:55.66
You see what I'm saying?

2908
02:53:55.66 --> 02:53:56.66
People not into cooking.

2909
02:53:56.66 --> 02:53:57.66
They don't do that kind of stuff.

2910
02:53:57.66 --> 02:53:59.66
What about the guy that the salt bay?

2911
02:53:59.66 --> 02:54:00.66
Oh, advanced.

2912
02:54:00.66 --> 02:54:01.66
Oh, it bears the deal.

2913
02:54:01.66 --> 02:54:02.66
Salt administrator.

2914
02:54:02.66 --> 02:54:04.66
I went to his restaurant.

2915
02:54:04.66 --> 02:54:05.66
Yeah.

2916
02:54:05.66 --> 02:54:08.66
And I have had him actually put salt on my steak.

2917
02:54:08.66 --> 02:54:09.66
Cut it for me.

2918
02:54:09.66 --> 02:54:10.66
Yep.

2919
02:54:10.66 --> 02:54:11.66
Any did he?

2920
02:54:11.66 --> 02:54:12.66
Any did it that way?

2921
02:54:12.66 --> 02:54:13.66
I did.

2922
02:54:13.66 --> 02:54:14.66
He was advanced.

2923
02:54:14.66 --> 02:54:15.66
Name drop.

2924
02:54:15.66 --> 02:54:19.66
You know, I was sitting there eating steak with a couple of friends.

2925
02:54:19.66 --> 02:54:22.66
Including Handsau Gracie.

2926
02:54:22.66 --> 02:54:23.66
We're kicking it.

2927
02:54:23.66 --> 02:54:24.66
Oh, yes.

2928
02:54:24.66 --> 02:54:25.66
That was that's a solid.

2929
02:54:25.66 --> 02:54:26.66
You're so awesome.

2930
02:54:26.66 --> 02:54:27.66
Yes.

2931
02:54:27.66 --> 02:54:28.66
Such an awesome guy.

2932
02:54:28.66 --> 02:54:29.66
Yes.

2933
02:54:29.66 --> 02:54:30.66
So there you go.

2934
02:54:30.66 --> 02:54:31.66
Name drop.

2935
02:54:31.66 --> 02:54:31.66
Yeah.

2936
02:54:31.66 --> 02:54:33.66
Anyway, so the point is, yeah, we have a YouTube channel.

2937
02:54:33.66 --> 02:54:34.66
So yeah, check that out.

2940
02:54:38.66 --> 02:54:40.66
You need a little spot.

2941
02:54:40.66 --> 02:54:41.66
That's what it is.

2942
02:54:41.66 --> 02:54:42.66
A spot.

2943
02:54:42.66 --> 02:54:44.66
If you're hitting moments of weakness,

2944
02:54:44.66 --> 02:54:48.66
specifically in the workouts that I mean, if I'm speaking from myself right now.

2945
02:54:48.66 --> 02:54:49.66
You can eat a little spot.

2946
02:54:49.66 --> 02:54:53.66
You want to get past that feeling of a little feel like doing this whatever.

2947
02:54:53.66 --> 02:54:54.66
Boom.

2948
02:54:54.66 --> 02:54:58.66
Psychological warfare will spot you a little bit.

2949
02:54:58.66 --> 02:55:03.66
Folks, I can't just dot com to code a Meyer making prints for you to hang up in your house.

2950
02:55:03.66 --> 02:55:04.66
That will keep you on the path.

2951
02:55:04.66 --> 02:55:05.66
We got a bunch of books.

2952
02:55:05.66 --> 02:55:08.66
We got top gun by Dan Patterson.

2953
02:55:08.66 --> 02:55:13.66
You can get that on joccompancast dot com the books.

Some people will late getting that up there.

2955
02:55:16.66 --> 02:55:17.66
No big deal.

2956
02:55:17.66 --> 02:55:18.66
You know, whatever.

2957
02:55:18.66 --> 02:55:19.66
Better late than never.

2958
02:55:19.66 --> 02:55:20.66
Yeah, it's an unsatheal.

2959
02:55:20.66 --> 02:55:21.66
You can get that there.

2960
02:55:21.66 --> 02:55:27.66
You can also get the latest book called The Code, the evaluation of protocols.

2961
02:55:27.66 --> 02:55:28.66
Dave Burke.

2962
02:55:28.66 --> 02:55:30.66
Get some good feedback on that book.

2963
02:55:30.66 --> 02:55:31.66
Big time.

2964
02:55:31.66 --> 02:55:34.66
The group.

2965
02:55:34.66 --> 02:55:35.66
The group.

2966
02:55:35.66 --> 02:55:38.66
Chupers are in the game on this book, which is awesome.

2967
02:55:38.66 --> 02:55:39.66
Humbling book.

2968
02:55:39.66 --> 02:55:43.66
Humbling and repetitively humbling.

2969
02:55:43.66 --> 02:55:53.66
It's one of those books where it's kind of like what you were saying about landing on a carrier and being on a carrier and having that life where you're like,

2970
02:55:53.66 --> 02:55:55.66
This is hard.

2971
02:55:55.66 --> 02:55:58.66
Yeah, but I love it.

2972
02:55:58.66 --> 02:56:00.66
That's the code the evaluation.

2973
02:56:00.66 --> 02:56:01.66
Put yourself in check.

2974
02:56:01.66 --> 02:56:03.66
And it's like a reminder.

2975
02:56:03.66 --> 02:56:09.66
It is a reminder because like a lot of this stuff is like, yeah, like you could have a one day.

2976
02:56:09.66 --> 02:56:11.66
You could have a zero day, right?

2977
02:56:11.66 --> 02:56:14.66
But if you forget about the code, it won't even really move you either way.

2978
02:56:14.66 --> 02:56:22.66
But if you're on the pat, you know, if you're if you are reminded that, hey, you're going by this code, you throw up a zero by that hurts, you know?

2979
02:56:22.66 --> 02:56:24.66
But if you're not reminded, it doesn't hurt.

2980
02:56:24.66 --> 02:56:25.66
It's just saying.

2981
02:56:25.66 --> 02:56:27.66
Yeah, remind yourself.

2982
02:56:27.66 --> 02:56:28.66
So get the code.

2983
02:56:28.66 --> 02:56:31.66
You can get leadership strategy and tack is field manual.

2984
02:56:31.66 --> 02:56:34.66
You can get way the warrior kid one two and three.

2985
02:56:34.66 --> 02:56:35.66
You can get Mikey in the dragon.

2986
02:56:35.66 --> 02:56:37.66
You can get this plenty goes freedom field manual.

2987
02:56:37.66 --> 02:56:39.66
You can get extreme ownership dichotomy leadership.

2988
02:56:39.66 --> 02:56:42.66
So the thing is, there's a bit of a question.

2989
02:56:42.66 --> 02:56:43.66
I've been writing books over here.

2990
02:56:43.66 --> 02:56:45.66
Get some information.

2991
02:56:45.66 --> 02:56:49.66
In ya check those books out, Ashlan front is our leadership consultancy, where we solve problems through leadership.

2992
02:56:49.66 --> 02:56:51.66
You may think, well, how are you doing that?

2993
02:56:51.66 --> 02:56:54.66
No one's traveling, cause a COVID-19.

2994
02:56:54.66 --> 02:56:57.66
Well, we are we are doing it all day long.

2995
02:56:57.66 --> 02:56:59.66
We're actually stepping up.

2996
02:56:59.66 --> 02:57:00.66
We're doing a lot of it.

2997
02:57:00.66 --> 02:57:02.66
We're doing it all virtual now.

2998
02:57:02.66 --> 02:57:08.66
And what we found is that you can have proof of your life,

2999
02:57:08.66 --> 02:57:11.16

Most of those people

3002
02:57:21.94 --> 02:57:28.82
What they're watching is the screen next to me on stage that's projecting my face. That's what they're actually watching

3003
02:57:29.66 --> 02:57:36.38
And then they don't have any interaction. They can't ask any questions because there's too many people there or during a zoom call

3004
02:57:36.38 --> 02:57:38.38
I'm

3014
02:58:18.14 --> 02:58:23.82
