00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.44
This is Jacob podcast number 215 with echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.44 --> 00:00:08.08
Jacob willing. Good evening, I go. Good evening.

3
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:12.08
I got a little quote, kick things off today.

4
00:00:12.08 --> 00:00:20.96
The general who does not advance to seek glory or does not withdraw to avoid punishment,

5
00:00:20.96 --> 00:00:28.48
but cares for only the people's security and promotes the people's interests

6
00:00:28.48 --> 00:00:33.68
is the nation's treasure. That's a little son Sue coming at you.

7
00:00:33.68 --> 00:00:39.92
And of course, we covered son Sue on podcast number 23.

8
00:00:39.92 --> 00:00:47.12
And it's just always interesting how you can find the same themes

9
00:00:47.12 --> 00:00:49.68
throughout time from a leadership perspective.

10
00:00:49.68 --> 00:00:55.36
I know I talk about this point a lot in leadership strategy and tactics book.

11
00:00:55.36 --> 00:00:59.92
This statement right here, this is 2500 years old.

12
00:00:59.92 --> 00:01:05.52
And he's saying the same thing that I say in leadership strategy and tactics

13
00:01:05.52 --> 00:01:12.64
that many of the problems that come about for a leader are from.

14
00:01:12.64 --> 00:01:18.80
There you go. And so we have to learn to keep our ego in check. Now this is,

15
00:01:18.80 --> 00:01:22.80
you know, we talk about it in extreme ownership, the very first book.

16
00:01:22.80 --> 00:01:26.64
This isn't like, hey, I just thought of this yesterday. And it's not like I just thought of this

17
00:01:26.64 --> 00:01:35.68
anyway. Like I said, somebody was jumping on somebody was making some comments on social media,

18
00:01:36.48 --> 00:01:44.16
platform that he said, he's acting like me. I'm acting like I invented covered move.

19
00:01:46.16 --> 00:01:50.80
I said, hey, no, it's actually, I say all the time, I didn't invent this or much of anything.

20
00:01:50.80 --> 00:01:57.36
So I didn't invent this idea of ego. I didn't just think of it, whatever.

21
00:01:59.68 --> 00:02:05.28
But it is a theme that we see over and over again from people that pay attention.

22
00:02:06.48 --> 00:02:10.88
Not just from a leadership perspective either. I mean, no more talking life problems.

23
00:02:10.88 --> 00:02:14.88
So this was interesting. So we just wrapped up the juggle live tour. It was awesome. Thanks for

24
00:02:14.88 --> 00:02:21.60
the game. I got some really good questions along the way. And a lot of times,

25
00:02:21.60 --> 00:02:26.56
the questions, sometimes the questions are about ego, even though the person doesn't even know

26
00:02:26.56 --> 00:02:30.56
that the questions about ego, but when you start to dig in, you start to realize that it's about ego.

27
00:02:30.56 --> 00:02:39.04
But the, so this first question is one of those questions. And the question was something

28
00:02:39.04 --> 00:02:46.32
along the lines of this. It was something like, what should I do if a peer of mine is working hard,

29
00:02:46.32 --> 00:02:54.48
putting an extra effort and trying to shine so that they get promoted? That was the question.

30
00:02:55.92 --> 00:03:00.72
And that's a good question, right? Because right, what do you do? And the instinct is,

31
00:03:01.36 --> 00:03:04.48
like you know what I'm saying? You can even feel that instinct. I could see it and look

32
00:03:04.48 --> 00:03:08.56
on your face right now. Yes. You have the look on your face of like, you can see that that's a

33
00:03:08.56 --> 00:03:13.12
little bit offensive, right? When you go, oh, this person's trying to, or,

34
00:03:13.12 --> 00:03:18.72
or trying to put that extra effort and trying to shine so that they can get promoted.

35
00:03:19.36 --> 00:03:26.48
Right. No one likes that person, by the way. Right. No one likes the brown noiser. So we get it.

36
00:03:27.20 --> 00:03:29.76
So then the question was, what should this person do? What? You know, let's

37
00:03:29.76 --> 00:03:34.96
to guy ask me, what do I do when that's happening? And the instinct, which is the instinct you

38
00:03:34.96 --> 00:03:40.96
had, which is the instinct, my first instinct, even me, Mr. Keep your ego in check.

39
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.40
My very first instinct is like a little bit of like a pushback, like, oh, it's that guy. And I want

40
00:03:46.40 --> 00:03:54.16
to lash out out, right? But that's not the right answer. You know, because, well, that's what you say,

41
00:03:54.16 --> 00:04:00.88
you say, oh, they think they are. Yeah. Look at what they're doing. So, you know what that is? That's

42
00:04:00.88 --> 00:04:05.28
making those attacks that's your own person legal. That's my own ego. My own ego going,

43
00:04:05.28 --> 00:04:13.68
with that person just wants to get promoted. So, if you can take a second, you can take a step back,

44
00:04:13.68 --> 00:04:20.96
you can detach, you can put your ego in check. And if you do that, then you say to yourself, okay,

45
00:04:21.92 --> 00:04:25.92
here's what's, here's the situation. If we remove the ego, here's the situation. This person

46
00:04:25.92 --> 00:04:31.20
is working extra hard. By the way, this person's appears. So, we're on the same team. This person

47
00:04:31.20 --> 00:04:38.88
is working extra hard. They're putting in extra effort. They are trying to shine. And all those things,

48
00:04:38.88 --> 00:04:49.60
all those things are actually good for your team. Right? I got someone that's trying to do a

49
00:04:49.60 --> 00:04:55.76
great job that's working harder. I'm actually happy. I'm actually happy. If there's a person,

50
00:04:55.76 --> 00:04:59.92
working harder, I'm actually, that's good. If there's a person that's trying to outwork me and

51
00:04:59.92 --> 00:05:06.48
do a better job than me, that's actually awesome. Because now we're going to be a better team.

52
00:05:07.28 --> 00:05:13.12
Now, mind you, any moment you let your ego slip into this, it turns into a nightmare. It's not

53
00:05:13.12 --> 00:05:17.76
good. You don't like it. You're offended. That's someone's trying to work harder than you.

54
00:05:19.04 --> 00:05:25.60
But if you keep your ego in check, then that's good. You realize that it's good. And I'll tell you

55
00:05:25.60 --> 00:05:31.28
something else in this way. What I answered this question. I said, for this person,

56
00:05:32.88 --> 00:05:41.44
to outwork me, he's going to have a hard time outwork me because I'm here to win too.

57
00:05:41.44 --> 00:05:46.000
And that is a little bit of my ego. But that, that ego is being a positive thing. Because I'm,

58
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.84
oh, you're going to step up your game. Guess what I'm going to do? Step up my game. I'm not going

59
00:05:49.84 --> 00:05:53.28
to undermine you. That would be negative. That would be my ego causing problem. But if I go,

60
00:05:53.28 --> 00:05:57.44
oh, your, echo is stepping up his game. Echo showing up at at six o'clock in the morning,

61
00:05:57.84 --> 00:06:01.92
instead of in set of six ten. Oh, and I'm, and I'm coming in at six. Oh, five. Guess what?

62
00:06:01.92 --> 00:06:09.44
Guess what? I'm going to come in in tomorrow. No, for 30. But you're right. So I do, I do a little bit more.

63
00:06:09.44 --> 00:06:12.64
So now, now we're both a little bit more prepared. Now we got some good competitive

64
00:06:12.64 --> 00:06:21.12
and this going on. That's good. It's good for the team. So you, this other person, this other

65
00:06:21.12 --> 00:06:24.64
person that's stepping up the game, trying to do a good job is actually awesome.

66
00:06:27.44 --> 00:06:30.72
Because it's going to make me step up my game. And I'm going to tell you right now, that person

67
00:06:30.72 --> 00:06:34.24
is going to have a hard time outworking me. They're going to have a hard time bringing it.

68
00:06:34.80 --> 00:06:38.08
I'm actually fired up. I'm actually getting fired up right now. Like, I'm getting,

69
00:06:38.08 --> 00:06:42.08
I'm, I'm starting to like, I'm thinking I might attack you right now just to see what's up.

70
00:06:44.08 --> 00:06:47.92
You go. So that's good. Now here's, here's where the second

71
00:06:47.92 --> 00:06:54.88
ego scenario that you have to get under control. What if that person steps up their game?

72
00:06:54.88 --> 00:07:00.64
I step up my game. They end up they actually do end up outshining me. They actually do end up

73
00:07:00.64 --> 00:07:09.04
getting the big promotion. Then what do I do? Do I get bitter? Do I get jealous? Do I get mad?

74
00:07:09.04 --> 00:07:18.48
Do I now start to undermine them and spread rumors about now? Actually, if somebody, if somebody

75
00:07:18.48 --> 00:07:27.44
outworked me and outperformed me and then got promoted, good for them, that is awesome. Credit.

76
00:07:28.96 --> 00:07:34.96
They get a credit. You're done good, son. You're done good. And there's nothing wrong with that.

77
00:07:34.96 --> 00:07:38.56
And what I am going to do is instead of being bitter and mad and jealous.

78
00:07:38.56 --> 00:07:43.28
And all those things, instead of actually going to put my ego out of the picture and say what

79
00:07:43.28 --> 00:07:48.64
actually happened, where did this person perform better than me? And how can I support them?

80
00:07:48.64 --> 00:07:52.16
How can I learn some lessons from this and how can I become better? So the next time

81
00:07:52.16 --> 00:08:00.32
there is an opportunity, I do get promoted. You wouldn't think that that question is about

82
00:08:00.32 --> 00:08:03.68
your own personal ego. From the beginning. Now it's easy to see. Looking back.

83
00:08:03.68 --> 00:08:06.80
Yeah. But from the beginning, it's like, hey, what do you do? How do you handle this situation?

84
00:08:06.80 --> 00:08:09.92
When someone's trying to outwork you and outshine you and they're trying to get promoted?

85
00:08:09.92 --> 00:08:15.92
Yeah. That sounds like an interpersonal relationship question. It's not. It's a question about ego.

86
00:08:17.04 --> 00:08:24.80
Which is, which is something we always need to pay attention to. So as I was thinking again,

87
00:08:24.80 --> 00:08:30.56
once again, Jockel live was kind of like, you went to two Jockel lives. Is that correct?

88
00:08:30.56 --> 00:08:36.72
Yes. They weren't really a podcast. They weren't really a Q&A. They weren't really just sort of

89
00:08:36.72 --> 00:08:44.48
a, they were a little bit of everything, right? A little bit of stories, a little bit of lessons,

90
00:08:44.48 --> 00:08:50.48
a little bit of, yeah, a little bit of everything. So I did get some questions, though.

91
00:08:50.48 --> 00:08:54.96
That first one was one of those general questions. And now, as I started thinking about the

92
00:08:54.96 --> 00:09:02.000
questions and how a lot of them related to ego, another question that I got that was actually

93
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.60
another important question. The question was again, something along the lines of, and I'm

94
00:09:07.60 --> 00:09:14.56
sure we can go back and, and pulled it recording. But here's the other thing. Is some of these

95
00:09:14.56 --> 00:09:18.96
questions that I got asked? I got asked like the same similar questions. So I'm paraphrasing

96
00:09:18.96 --> 00:09:25.28
what this other question was. But this one, the question was something along the lines of,

97
00:09:25.28 --> 00:09:32.72
hey, listen, Jockel. I know that keeping the ego in check is important. Principal, I read about

98
00:09:32.72 --> 00:09:36.96
an extreme ownership. You talk about it all the time. Got to be humble. But at my company,

99
00:09:36.96 --> 00:09:44.16
ego is a huge problem. How do I get my company to start promoting the ideal of humility?

100
00:09:44.16 --> 00:09:50.32
And how do I get them to recognize that ego is such a big problem? Now, this is a really good

101
00:09:50.32 --> 00:09:56.72
question. Once again, because you can imagine what this individual is, right? Like, you know,

102
00:09:56.72 --> 00:10:00.96
you're at a company where there's a lot of ego's going on. And all of a sudden, you have a little

103
00:10:00.96 --> 00:10:06.64
moment of enlightenment. You realize that ego is causing you a lot of problems. So you start putting

104
00:10:06.64 --> 00:10:10.88
your own ego in check. Have any of you go, wow, this is working. I'm doing better. I'm coordinating

105
00:10:10.88 --> 00:10:15.20
better. I'm working in my interpersonal relationships with other people on the team are better.

106
00:10:15.20 --> 00:10:18.96
My relationships with people on other teams are better. We're getting more done because our

107
00:10:18.96 --> 00:10:22.80
relationships are better. I'm putting the team in the mission above myself. That means the

108
00:10:22.80 --> 00:10:28.56
team in the mission are doing better. That's great. So you realize all this stuff. And then you say,

109
00:10:28.56 --> 00:10:34.32
okay, well, how do I start to spread the word? How do I get other people to do this? And this is a

110
00:10:34.32 --> 00:10:41.12
tricky question, right? It's a tricky thing because if some, if like, let's say your team has,

111
00:10:41.68 --> 00:10:47.76
you see that ego is a problem and you sit them down and go, listen guys, you're all, you're all

112
00:10:47.76 --> 00:10:53.84
got big ego's and that's the problem. I mean, you're going to run into level nine defensiveness.

113
00:10:53.84 --> 00:10:57.76
You're actually going, it's actually going to be on defensiveness. They're going to start attacking you.

114
00:10:57.76 --> 00:11:01.28
That's what's going to happen. You got all these crazy ego's. They're going to gang up. They're like,

115
00:11:01.28 --> 00:11:05.60
unite. You know, put their ego aside for a split second. That can unite against you.

116
00:11:07.28 --> 00:11:15.12
So you can't confront them. And once again, are there certain relationships that you could have

117
00:11:15.12 --> 00:11:19.60
with someone where I go, let's say you and me and you had to be ego. But you and I were really

118
00:11:19.60 --> 00:11:23.92
tightness at hey man, you're letting your ego get in the way of this. Sure, that kid that that is

119
00:11:23.92 --> 00:11:30.24
a possibility. That is a very rare occurrence. Most of the people that you work with on regular basis,

120
00:11:30.24 --> 00:11:35.68
you don't have that type of a relationship. The other thing is when someone has a big ego,

121
00:11:35.68 --> 00:11:40.40
that's not the type of person that's open to those kind of criticisms anyways. So it's like there's

122
00:11:40.40 --> 00:11:45.28
two hurdles that you have to overcome. Number one, your relationship isn't usually that good.

123
00:11:45.28 --> 00:11:49.52
Number two, they have a big ego, which is part of the problem. And that's what makes the problem hard

124
00:11:49.52 --> 00:11:59.84
to attack. So what are you going to do? That and I got to throw this one more little thing

125
00:11:59.84 --> 00:12:06.000
when people talk about the, you know, I have someone say, put, wouldn't it be better if you

126
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.56
could just talk to? Wouldn't it be better if you just, you know, put down some bulletized

127
00:12:12.56 --> 00:12:16.56
list and said, hey, here's the things that your ego, there's the problems that your goes from

128
00:12:16.56 --> 00:12:21.28
causing. Look, I get it. And isn't it great to have direct conversations? Isn't it great if I

129
00:12:21.28 --> 00:12:28.40
can just sit you down if echo, if you and I have this mind melt where you just know 100% looking

130
00:12:28.40 --> 00:12:34.24
out for you and you're open to create. Like if we have that, that's in an ideal world, that's great.

131
00:12:34.24 --> 00:12:41.04
That's great. Golfclap. It's great. The problem is it doesn't exist very often. And

132
00:12:41.92 --> 00:12:47.12
confronting someone that has an ego about the ego can often just exacerbate the problem.

133
00:12:48.56 --> 00:12:58.88
So here's what you do. Instead of self-identifying the problem and pointing the fingers at other

134
00:12:58.88 --> 00:13:05.04
people, which by the way is placing blame, which is a problem. So instead of doing that,

135
00:13:06.08 --> 00:13:11.04
what we're going to do is start pulling the thread on some of the problems that we're having

136
00:13:11.76 --> 00:13:22.80
on the team. So for instance, this group over here needs some help on their part of the project,

137
00:13:22.80 --> 00:13:29.44
but no one's helping them. What's going on? If you start to pull the thread on that, you'll find

138
00:13:29.44 --> 00:13:35.12
at the end of that thread, they'll be hanging some egos. Whether it's the ego of the person that

139
00:13:35.12 --> 00:13:39.12
doesn't want to ask help, or whether it's the ego of the other person that doesn't want to give

140
00:13:39.12 --> 00:13:46.96
help because they think they need to do their own job. I'm not doing that. So you pull the thread

141
00:13:46.96 --> 00:13:50.96
and at the end you'll find these little egos hanging and then what you do is you just expose.

142
00:13:50.96 --> 00:13:54.32
And you say, what do you think the root of the problem is? You start pulling that thread and you get

143
00:13:54.32 --> 00:13:59.44
to a point where someone says, you can finally have an open conversation. Where you say, where someone

144
00:13:59.44 --> 00:14:08.72
finally says, we know I guess I guess I could use some help. You just discovered it. So that's like a

145
00:14:08.72 --> 00:14:13.52
covering move situation, right? If a covering move isn't happening and it isn't happening because

146
00:14:13.52 --> 00:14:18.40
of egos, if you pull the thread, you'll get to the end of the thread and it will be attached to

147
00:14:18.40 --> 00:14:22.64
someone ego in most cases. Is there a possibility that it's like, hey, this group doesn't know

148
00:14:22.64 --> 00:14:26.40
what the other groups don't? Yeah, absolutely. Those are, but those are easy problems to solve.

149
00:14:26.40 --> 00:14:30.64
Because we can just pull the thread, we find at the end, oh, we need to, we need better coordination

150
00:14:30.64 --> 00:14:34.80
between these two teams. Cool. There it is. When you pull the thread, it comes out the little

151
00:14:34.80 --> 00:14:40.000
egos dangling on the end of it. Then you go, okay, let's expose these and let's try and ask

152
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.32
questions to figure out and get people to realize what they're looking at. You want them to come to

153
00:14:48.32 --> 00:14:54.24
that conclusion. That's the trick. That's the maneuver. Is to get them to come to conclusion and

154
00:14:54.24 --> 00:14:59.36
they might never verbalize it, but they go, yeah, in their mind, they're like, I guess I didn't want

155
00:14:59.36 --> 00:15:07.44
to ask for help because my ego isn't the way. So there's one, you know, if you got people that

156
00:15:07.44 --> 00:15:12.08
are taking on or keeping things simple, just go through the laws combat, simple, make people

157
00:15:12.08 --> 00:15:19.12
making the plans to complex and yet they keep doing it. And when you go and say, you know,

158
00:15:19.12 --> 00:15:25.12
these plans seem like they're really complex. And of course, they say something like, hey,

159
00:15:25.12 --> 00:15:31.20
I don't think everyone understood the plan. It seems to seem kind of complex. And a person says,

160
00:15:32.48 --> 00:15:40.32
people need to pay more attention when I'm briefing. And you pull on that, right? The front line

161
00:15:40.32 --> 00:15:44.16
troops, they need more detail because they go, otherwise they're going to screw up. That's why

162
00:15:44.16 --> 00:15:50.24
it's so complex. It's like, okay, let's look at what's really happening. What's really happening

163
00:15:50.24 --> 00:15:58.56
is I've created a plan that I won't give up because my ego is too big. Right? When you pull that

164
00:15:58.56 --> 00:16:03.84
thread and you go, listen to the front line troops, don't understand what to do. It seems like

165
00:16:03.84 --> 00:16:11.36
that could be a real problem. And maybe, and this is nothing you give them a little out. You give

166
00:16:11.36 --> 00:16:16.16
them a little out. Maybe we just need to back it off a little bit so that they can understand

167
00:16:16.16 --> 00:16:21.20
it, maybe they're not as smart as you. You go, listen, you go, listen, you know what? Fine,

168
00:16:21.20 --> 00:16:26.40
I'll simplify it. Boom. And in the meantime, you've given them a little indication, look,

169
00:16:26.40 --> 00:16:30.96
if you confront them, that's what I'm saying. It's hard for people to want to play the long game here.

170
00:16:30.96 --> 00:16:35.04
Because the short game is that you think you're so smart, you're playing to do complex and you're

171
00:16:35.04 --> 00:16:39.44
sticking with them because you got a big ego. How's that going to work out? It's not going to

172
00:16:39.44 --> 00:16:45.76
work out good. Can it work out 4% of the time? Yes. The other, the other, the other,

173
00:16:46.88 --> 00:16:51.76
96% of the time, you get a defensive person that's now accusing other people. It's

174
00:16:54.08 --> 00:16:57.36
take the indirect and play the long game. Take the indirect attack and play the long game.

175
00:16:57.36 --> 00:17:04.80
Prioritize next Q. Why is that failing? Because again, this question is Ego's a problem.

176
00:17:04.80 --> 00:17:08.80
So where does Ego manifest as a problem? It can manifest as a problem in

177
00:17:08.80 --> 00:17:14.08
prioritized next Q. Because if someone's got a big ego and they're not getting things done,

178
00:17:14.08 --> 00:17:17.36
they go, I can get it done. Because their ego thinks they can do anything, right?

179
00:17:17.36 --> 00:17:26.24
Or prioritize Q. Ego can be a problem. If you have a project and I have a project and you need help

180
00:17:28.24 --> 00:17:31.76
and your project is actually more important. I should give you resources, but instead of

181
00:17:31.76 --> 00:17:36.80
like my initiative, just as important as Ego's is. Which is just my ego. I should look at it and

182
00:17:36.80 --> 00:17:42.56
say, okay, you know what, you should be the priority. And another good one is, well, it's just what

183
00:17:42.56 --> 00:17:47.84
I just said, but I'm not going to give up. Why should I have to give my resources to Ego? Those are mine.

184
00:17:49.44 --> 00:17:56.80
Those are mine. No, actually, what's the biggest priority? Okay, put my ego aside. Ego's

185
00:17:56.80 --> 00:18:03.04
priority is actually bigger than mine. I'm going to give him four of my people so that he can get the job done.

186
00:18:05.12 --> 00:18:09.60
So when you pull the front on this and you say, well, hey, why is it Jocca? Why is it? You don't

187
00:18:09.60 --> 00:18:16.32
want to give people to Ego? And I'm like, well, you know, what if something else comes up?

188
00:18:16.32 --> 00:18:21.28
Well, something else comes up. You can get back. Well, you know, they got to learn to respect the

189
00:18:21.28 --> 00:18:25.52
chain of command. Well, there's still work for you. They'll just be loaned over to Ego. Well,

190
00:18:26.32 --> 00:18:30.32
you should understand? It's just ego, ego, ego, ego. So these are the kind of problems that

191
00:18:30.32 --> 00:18:36.32
manifests themselves inside of a company wrapped around ego. And decentralized command, you can have

192
00:18:36.32 --> 00:18:41.92
the same thing happen with decentralized command. How does ego cause a problem with decentralized

193
00:18:41.92 --> 00:18:46.64
command? It's like this. Hey, I noticed that you know, you seem to be making all the decisions

194
00:18:47.28 --> 00:18:50.88
and the folks out in the field don't really have the opportunity to kind of make calls.

195
00:18:52.40 --> 00:18:55.28
Why is that on the only one that has the experience to do this?

196
00:18:57.76 --> 00:19:04.08
They don't have the skill that I have. Right. So there's all these reasons that that's one of those

197
00:19:04.08 --> 00:19:11.92
are ego problems. Right. And by the way, if it's not an ego problem, then I say, oh, you know what?

198
00:19:11.92 --> 00:19:15.36
Cause I haven't really trained the guys well enough. And I'm going to, you know what, you're right.

199
00:19:15.36 --> 00:19:19.20
I've been making way too many detailed decisions for the guys out in the field. I need to get down

200
00:19:19.20 --> 00:19:22.56
there and make sure they know what's going on, train them better so that I can back off. Cool.

201
00:19:22.56 --> 00:19:26.72
That's the person that's got the ego in check. The person that's like, I'm the only one that can

202
00:19:26.72 --> 00:19:32.000
do this. Like, no, you can't get no, you're not. And if you are, you're wrong.

203
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.56
Because right now, you've got three people working for you. What happens when you have eight?

204
00:19:36.56 --> 00:19:40.56
You're going to go around the field in all these different locations to make every single

205
00:19:40.56 --> 00:19:46.32
decision. No, you can't. So get your ego under control. Realize that you're not the only one

206
00:19:46.32 --> 00:19:52.80
that can do this job and train your people properly. Again, that's a direct assault. Probably

207
00:19:52.80 --> 00:19:57.04
going to cause problems. Instead, if we just pull the thread on it, hey, what's going on?

208
00:19:57.04 --> 00:20:00.48
It seems like you're, it's folks in the field don't have a lot of authority. Well, you know

209
00:20:00.48 --> 00:20:06.000
that experience. Oh, okay. It's kind of cumbersome though. Like, then reaching back to you all the time

210
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.36
to make these decisions. It is, but you know, I'm the one that really knows how to do it.

211
00:20:11.36 --> 00:20:16.48
I mean, what happens if, you know, if you're sick or, you know, someone's got to, you know,

212
00:20:16.48 --> 00:20:24.16
have communications with them. Do you think it would be a good idea? You know, since you

213
00:20:24.16 --> 00:20:27.36
have so much knowledge of experience to maybe pass that onto some of the other people?

214
00:20:27.36 --> 00:20:37.28
Oh, yeah. Okay, cool. Let's make that happen. And then obviously, ego can absolutely

215
00:20:37.28 --> 00:20:46.16
manifest itself when it comes to taking ownership. I mean, all day long, right? What, oh,

216
00:20:46.16 --> 00:20:50.000
that project failed. What happened? My support. It's don't know. Don't want to step up.

217
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:58.16
Oh, because it's their fault. Why, why are your support in it's taking ownership?

218
00:20:58.16 --> 00:21:03.76
Because they don't even know what ownership is. They don't want to take ownership. Okay.

219
00:21:03.76 --> 00:21:08.32
So it's not your fault. No. Okay. Well, what can we do to help them?

220
00:21:10.88 --> 00:21:16.96
Pull the string and you add the bottom. The person will see. It's the ego. They might not admit it,

221
00:21:16.96 --> 00:21:24.72
but they'll see it. And then they can start to make adjustments. Now, look, can any of these situations

222
00:21:25.28 --> 00:21:30.64
escalate in a point where indirect indirect indirect doesn't work? And eventually you say,

223
00:21:30.64 --> 00:21:36.08
you know what? I got a, I got to sit echoed down and say, listen, here's what I think is the

224
00:21:36.08 --> 00:21:41.36
root of the problem. The root of the problem is you think you're the only one that knows how to do this.

225
00:21:42.32 --> 00:21:46.56
And in thinking that you're not training anybody like I might have to get that direct. It does

226
00:21:46.56 --> 00:21:53.44
happen. We prefer to use the minimum force required when it comes to leadership, just like being a

227
00:21:53.44 --> 00:21:59.36
balancer. Yes, sir. Right? It's not hey, the guys a little out of line, hate him in the head with a black

228
00:21:59.36 --> 00:22:03.84
jack. No, it's like, hey, you're, hey, sir. You know, I think you've had enough for tonight.

229
00:22:03.84 --> 00:22:08.48
Can you come with me? That's minimum force required. If the guy says, okay, cool. It's problem solved.

230
00:22:09.28 --> 00:22:13.44
If he's, if he says, you're a muck going anywhere. Okay. Well, we have to escalate. It's the same thing

231
00:22:13.44 --> 00:22:19.20
here, but don't start with the direct attack. Just like you don't club the person out of the gate.

232
00:22:19.20 --> 00:22:24.24
I think it's a slap jack. I'm not sure. Okay. That's what you're talking about. That

233
00:22:24.24 --> 00:22:30.72
little as they're thing. Yeah, a black jack. Yeah, black. Yeah. Right? It's a black. Did you guys

234
00:22:30.72 --> 00:22:38.16
not use those? That's a think those are illegal. That's illegal. Yeah, the slap jack. Yeah. One guy had

235
00:22:38.16 --> 00:22:46.48
one. Yeah. But yeah, they're illegal. So we don't want to escalate straight to the black jack.

236
00:22:47.68 --> 00:22:52.56
Or even a slap jack. Even a slap jack. If anyone's using a slap jack. I think it's called a slap

237
00:22:52.56 --> 00:23:01.52
jack. Okay. I'm not sure. Point remains. I dig it fairly confident you're wrong, but not 100%.

238
00:23:01.52 --> 00:23:05.28
Yeah, I'm like, I'm like, you know, when someone, you know, when you're pretty confident about

239
00:23:05.28 --> 00:23:08.88
something that somebody just throws a little randomness into the soup and it makes you question yourself.

240
00:23:08.88 --> 00:23:12.64
Yeah. That's how I feel right now. Yeah. That's kind of real confident with a little bit of questions.

241
00:23:14.24 --> 00:23:21.20
It makes you feel any better. That's my everyday life. So that's the answer to this question.

242
00:23:21.20 --> 00:23:27.52
Is really pulling the thread on the problem to reveal the root of the problem, which you're

243
00:23:27.52 --> 00:23:35.60
going to see as ego. And then it's there for the people. Hopefully to see it to recognize it,

244
00:23:35.60 --> 00:23:41.12
to possibly admit it. Maybe not give them an out where they can actually make a adjustment without

245
00:23:41.12 --> 00:23:44.72
taking the ownership of the ego because that's okay. We're trying to win, right? We're trying

246
00:23:44.72 --> 00:23:50.08
to let the team win. We're not trying to, we're not, what my goal is not to make you admit it.

247
00:23:50.88 --> 00:23:56.24
Because you know what that is? That's my ego. No, yeah. Let's show it. Yeah. It's got a big ego.

248
00:23:56.24 --> 00:24:00.08
Get them to get them to admit it. That's not what my goal is. My goal is to make you make

249
00:24:00.08 --> 00:24:10.24
better decisions as a leader so that we win as a team. Yeah. So that's what we're trying to do here.

250
00:24:11.76 --> 00:24:18.24
It's really interesting that how you laid that out because you used to do that to me. Uh oh.

251
00:24:18.24 --> 00:24:22.88
Probably still do. Maybe. But it was less about the ego I think anyway. Maybe it's all the same.

252
00:24:22.88 --> 00:24:27.68
Maybe at the end of the day it's all the same. It's possible. Because skating or trying to

253
00:24:27.68 --> 00:24:31.52
dance or writing or explaining to me how I would do this to you. You do with excuses. Okay. So like

254
00:24:31.52 --> 00:24:36.000
if something didn't get done or can't get done or I think it's too hard and really most of the time

255
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.80
if I'm remembering correctly it was at the end of the day this is what it was. It was like,

256
00:24:41.84 --> 00:24:47.52
I'm too lazy for whatever. You know, so it always be like this excuse like, well you know that's

257
00:24:47.52 --> 00:24:51.92
to the answer. That's that. And then you'd have all these just like how you're saying and it made

258
00:24:51.92 --> 00:24:56.000
me remember this because you're tone how you're like kind of saying those little answers there.

259
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.80
Ah, that's the same to me. Like, we're all simple. Just like, well just here. Here's the solution

260
00:25:00.80 --> 00:25:04.64
to that problem right here. Because there's all these little excuses that you make. You know like,

261
00:25:04.64 --> 00:25:08.80
oh, I didn't really have time because I had to do this and you'd be like, okay, then you just do this.

262
00:25:08.80 --> 00:25:13.44
You know, and that'll solve that particular problem. You didn't have this big comprehensive plan to

263
00:25:13.44 --> 00:25:18.64
solve in my life problem. You're like, okay, for every excuse I would make, you just have the little

264
00:25:18.64 --> 00:25:24.08
solve, you know, the problem or the solution to it. And I'd be like, man, and meanwhile you're

265
00:25:24.08 --> 00:25:29.36
getting back into this corner or the string is just getting pulled like, with every pull you start

266
00:25:29.36 --> 00:25:36.08
to sense or stop it. In your case, it was lazy. Oh yeah, like I just was too lazy or I'm just like stuck

267
00:25:36.08 --> 00:25:41.04
in this routine or whatever. And then it's so it could in a way be like, okay, that's just my

268
00:25:41.04 --> 00:25:46.32
ego just thinking that the way that's not the way I do things kind of thing. And think if I were to

269
00:25:46.32 --> 00:25:52.40
use the different tone, think if I would have just said, that's could you're lazy. Oh yeah,

270
00:25:52.40 --> 00:25:56.72
yeah, you just being lazy, echo. You'd have been like, you even know what it takes to make one of these

271
00:25:56.72 --> 00:25:59.44
things. Oh, you know what I mean? Yeah. And then all of a sudden we, and what does that do to our

272
00:25:59.44 --> 00:26:06.000
relationship? Yeah. And what does that do to to do that final product? Yeah. Right now you're doing

273
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
something against your will. Oh, yeah. Oh, just staying a little bit. Staying on it. Yeah,

274
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.64
fully. And yeah, if you would have just been like, hey, you're lazy, this is what my mind would have

275
00:26:16.64 --> 00:26:22.000
went to this belief. This actually, and in a way, it's true, but it doesn't like get anyone anywhere,

276
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.32
where if you would be like, you're lazy, I would have thought and maybe even said that it's not

277
00:26:26.32 --> 00:26:30.16
that I'm lazy. It's just you're just this crazy hard worker who have these standards that are

278
00:26:30.16 --> 00:26:35.60
unreasonable for a normal person. And I'm just a normal person, excuse me, you know, kind of an attitude.

279
00:26:35.60 --> 00:26:41.52
That's what I would go to rather than if you like the way how you always do it is like you pull

280
00:26:41.52 --> 00:26:46.24
the string or you just sort of, you know what's interesting too is when I'm doing that,

281
00:26:47.44 --> 00:26:52.48
I'm not doing that like, okay, I got the, here's my next move on echo. Yeah. Actually what I'm doing

282
00:26:52.48 --> 00:26:58.000
is like, whoa, you know, you say, well, we can't, I can't make a video because it's going to take

283
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.36
me too long to get through the raw edits. And I go, you know, I'll say like, well, you know,

284
00:27:03.36 --> 00:27:08.000
if you want, just get, you know, hire someone to do those raw edits for you. Right.

285
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.40
And would that work? Yeah. You know what I mean? I mean, I'll ask you a legitimate question. Oh,

286
00:27:12.40 --> 00:27:15.68
yeah. Maybe I kind of know the answer. I mean, I suspect I know the answer, but it's not,

287
00:27:16.48 --> 00:27:24.16
it's not just, hey, I'm setting you up. I'm legitimately pulling the thread. And the answer might

288
00:27:24.16 --> 00:27:29.68
be it is impossible to get this project done. But when I say, well, you could hire someone to do

289
00:27:29.68 --> 00:27:37.12
those raw edits. And then you go, okay, well, even if I hire someone, how am I going to transfer

290
00:27:37.12 --> 00:27:44.56
all this data? And I go, well, if you want, what couldn't you get an external hard drive and just

291
00:27:44.56 --> 00:27:50.96
physically give it to him? And you'd say, well, these are actual situations. No, I don't know.

292
00:27:50.96 --> 00:27:58.72
I just, I don't know the realm of video well enough to go down those roads. The main, the one that

293
00:27:58.72 --> 00:28:04.08
I remember the easiest is like with training. Like, it'll be, hey, we're training at 430,

294
00:28:04.08 --> 00:28:08.96
but I train during the day, almost, oh, not in the evening. Then you'll be like, oh, yeah,

295
00:28:08.96 --> 00:28:12.96
training at 430, I'm like, well, you know, and I have all these reasons. And then you're like,

296
00:28:12.96 --> 00:28:16.80
you kind of just chip away at all these reasons. Like, oh, here's the solution to that. Here's

297
00:28:16.80 --> 00:28:21.12
the solution to that. Here's the solution. It's like, man, I just, I just, like, my routine. I just

298
00:28:21.12 --> 00:28:25.12
got to admit it, you know, like, all right. But I don't get to train with you guys this often,

299
00:28:25.12 --> 00:28:30.48
you know, kind of thing. But it's like, yeah, you expose, you pull the string to expose just,

300
00:28:30.48 --> 00:28:38.48
like the little, the little excuses. Sure. So, pull the thread, reveal the problem. Don't

301
00:28:38.48 --> 00:28:45.52
confront if you can help it. And people will start to recognize what the problem is. I mean,

302
00:28:45.52 --> 00:28:51.92
this is assuming you're working with this, well, there's one problem with this. And that is,

303
00:28:51.92 --> 00:28:58.24
if the person has a giant ego, this is the hardest thing for them to admit, right? So they might not

304
00:28:58.24 --> 00:29:03.12
admit it. But they'll see it. They'll behave differently. And by the way, one of the good ways to

305
00:29:04.40 --> 00:29:12.40
to use someone's ego against themselves is when you say something along the lines of, you know,

306
00:29:13.28 --> 00:29:17.92
man, it's going to look good if this gets done right. You know what I'm saying? And they think,

307
00:29:17.92 --> 00:29:22.64
oh, cool. I'm going to do this. I'm going to make this adjustment just so it gets done, just so

308
00:29:22.64 --> 00:29:28.96
my ego can get just so I can win. Yeah, that doesn't say that. Use the word win. Because every time

309
00:29:28.96 --> 00:29:38.24
like, use the word win. And anytime, what I'd be thinking, like, okay, if I didn't win, what's left,

310
00:29:38.24 --> 00:29:44.40
you lost? Yeah. No matter what excuse you make you lost. So if you put shed light on, like, use that

311
00:29:44.40 --> 00:29:49.44
word and be like, hey, this will make you win. And you're like, hell, yeah. But at the same time,

312
00:29:49.44 --> 00:29:52.96
the back of my mind, like, basically, if we don't solve these problems or whatever, I lose,

313
00:29:52.96 --> 00:29:58.000
I don't want that. So it's like, extra motivated. It's the winning at all costs thing. And so the

314
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.28
winning at all costs, I wrote like a little section. And it was a part of a one of the special releases

315
00:30:03.28 --> 00:30:08.96
on Barnes and Noble's version of that caught a minute of leadership was this thing, winning at all costs.

316
00:30:09.84 --> 00:30:15.60
And it's, and then someone posted, and I had, I had said it before, right? And someone posted a

317
00:30:15.60 --> 00:30:22.32
clip of me saying this idea of winning at all costs. And it's the way that I talk about it.

318
00:30:22.32 --> 00:30:26.08
It's kind of a trick anyways, because I go through this thing about what is leadership and

319
00:30:26.08 --> 00:30:30.96
a leadership is this leadership that, and then I said, what leadership is to me is winning at all costs.

320
00:30:30.96 --> 00:30:37.52
And somebody put, I'm probably you put a clip up of me saying that. And somebody said,

321
00:30:38.40 --> 00:30:42.32
of course, someone's like, that's the kind of person that will run people over in a bubble

322
00:30:42.32 --> 00:30:46.88
or more. Like, like, gave it negative things, right? But what they don't realize is what the

323
00:30:46.88 --> 00:30:52.56
rest of that clip says. And what the rest of that whole idea of winning at all costs is what

324
00:30:52.56 --> 00:30:57.60
I'll do to win at all costs is totally subordinate. My ego help other people support them,

325
00:30:57.60 --> 00:31:04.08
give them what they need and put my put, put the team and the mission above myself, because

326
00:31:04.08 --> 00:31:07.76
the, that's how I'm going to win at all costs. So winning at all costs doesn't mean I'm stepping

327
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:12.80
on other people. I mean, it's actually lifting other people up. That's what it means. So if you can

328
00:31:12.80 --> 00:31:19.60
use that, you know, if I say, hey, I go, man, look, we need to win. And if we're going to win,

329
00:31:20.40 --> 00:31:24.72
the only way to win is if you can learn how to work with Jim, otherwise we lose. And you're

330
00:31:24.72 --> 00:31:29.84
like, you know what? Because I'm a winner all work with Jim. And cool, it's a first step.

331
00:31:29.84 --> 00:31:38.72
Yeah. Yeah. And this was kind of related to a question that we haven't done a Q&A in a

332
00:31:38.72 --> 00:31:43.28
long time. And this is kind of a partial Q&A. Sure. I don't know. It's just some topics.

333
00:31:43.92 --> 00:31:51.76
But anyways, we got one of these questions hit it. Yes, Jocco, what do you tell someone who has

334
00:31:51.76 --> 00:31:56.40
been passed over for a military promotion? They deserved. Could you address this?

335
00:31:56.40 --> 00:32:03.12
Yeah. So part of it is what we just talked about. What do you do when you get passed over? Cool.

336
00:32:03.12 --> 00:32:08.32
Why did so? And it's also covered in, I think there's a, well, I know, there's a literal chapter

337
00:32:08.32 --> 00:32:15.76
inside leadership strategy and tactics, which is what to do when you're, when you don't get promoted.

338
00:32:15.76 --> 00:32:22.80
That's that's the actual name of the chapter. When you're not chosen, page 160, boom, there it is.

339
00:32:22.80 --> 00:32:29.28
When you are not chosen, and we covered it on the podcast. So what you do is you go and you say,

340
00:32:30.64 --> 00:32:34.64
boss, I know there's opportunities to get promoted. I know I didn't get promoted. I know there

341
00:32:34.64 --> 00:32:40.08
must be some shortfalls that I have. Can you help me indicate what those shortfalls are? Cool.

342
00:32:40.08 --> 00:32:47.44
So that's, and I'll just give a factual. There's the officer commissioning program that I got picked

343
00:32:47.44 --> 00:32:55.20
up for. It was called the Seaman 2 Admiral program. It was a highly selective program. They took

344
00:32:55.20 --> 00:33:01.60
50 sailors from the entire Navy. And there's, I don't know, 250,000 something people say was in the

345
00:33:01.60 --> 00:33:09.60
Navy. They took 50. And the first year that I put in for it, I did not get selected. I got actually

346
00:33:09.60 --> 00:33:15.84
I got selected as an alternate, which was as they say, almost worse. Yeah, let's see it.

347
00:33:15.84 --> 00:33:21.92
Because you don't, you don't, you get nothing. You get the smell it. Yeah, you get the smell it. You

348
00:33:21.92 --> 00:33:26.32
don't get the touch. You don't get to taste it. So it was not good. Well, it was good. Because I was like,

349
00:33:26.32 --> 00:33:32.64
okay, I'm close. But, but I didn't get it. I didn't get it. And what did I do?

350
00:33:33.68 --> 00:33:40.48
Assessed. And said, what can I do better? And work harder. And the next year, I got it. So if you

351
00:33:40.48 --> 00:33:47.60
don't get promoted, because you deserved it, maybe you didn't deserve it. And if you did deserve it,

352
00:33:47.60 --> 00:33:52.24
you'll get it next time. And instead of saying you deserved it, why not look at it and say,

353
00:33:52.24 --> 00:33:58.40
okay, what did I not do to make myself the best absolute best candidate that they could not

354
00:33:58.40 --> 00:34:02.96
question needed to get this promotion? Instead, we're saying I deserved it. Someone else got,

355
00:34:02.96 --> 00:34:08.000
what is that doing? Blaming the boss blade in the selection process, blaming all these other

356
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.24
things that you cannot control. But if you take ownership of it and say, you know what?

357
00:34:12.24 --> 00:34:14.88
Okay, I didn't get promoted. There must be some things that I can do better.

358
00:34:17.12 --> 00:34:25.76
There's the answer. Own it. Ask, give me some feedback, please. What do I need to make this happen?

359
00:34:25.76 --> 00:34:35.52
And then implement. Now, this, this, there was this other topic that I kind of wanted to

360
00:34:35.52 --> 00:34:42.32
bring up. That was from, once again, it was from Jockel Live. And there was a young woman.

361
00:34:45.12 --> 00:34:51.84
And again, this, this goes to the kind of variety of different people that were coming to the

362
00:34:51.84 --> 00:34:56.80
Jockel Lives were all over the place. So this, this young woman asked a question that was kind of like,

363
00:34:58.24 --> 00:35:03.36
how do you, and I can't, when you're at the live events, there's light shining in your eyes.

364
00:35:03.36 --> 00:35:07.12
So you're not really 100% sure. You don't get it. It's not like that, you're not seeing the

365
00:35:07.12 --> 00:35:12.64
person face to face. So I'm kind of looking out into the light. I'm seeing this frame of a young woman.

366
00:35:12.64 --> 00:35:17.36
And she asked something along the lines of, you know, how do you handle when there's people

367
00:35:17.36 --> 00:35:23.36
that are trying to pull you down and, and, and, you know, pick you apart.

368
00:35:23.36 --> 00:35:34.40
And I said, well, what do you do? And she's like, I'm in school. And I said, what school?

369
00:35:34.40 --> 00:35:38.48
And she said, high school. And I said, what grade? And she said, I'm a freshman.

370
00:35:40.08 --> 00:35:44.40
And I said, okay, so you're getting bullied. But because essentially, that's what that's what you

371
00:35:44.40 --> 00:35:48.72
was saying, right? I'm getting picked on. I got people trying to drag me down. What you know what that's

372
00:35:48.72 --> 00:35:55.52
called, that's called bullying. I said, so you're getting bullied. And she said, yes, getting bullied.

373
00:35:56.56 --> 00:36:04.64
So I said, I said, you know, I thought about it for a second. I said, well, I've got some

374
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:14.16
bad news. And I've got some good news. And I'm going to start with the bad news. The bad news is that

375
00:36:14.16 --> 00:36:26.32
people can be mean. And they can be mean for a variety of reasons. They can be mean

376
00:36:27.04 --> 00:36:31.44
because they're insecure. They can be mean because they're bullied themselves. They can be mean

377
00:36:31.44 --> 00:36:37.44
because they're unhappy. They can be mean because they're scared to be vulnerable. So they put up that front.

378
00:36:37.44 --> 00:36:47.60
But they might be suffering and jealous and have no self-esteem. It's the way some people are.

379
00:36:47.60 --> 00:36:51.92
And there's some people that are just evil that get joy out of putting other people down. So there's

380
00:36:51.92 --> 00:37:02.16
all those kind of people exist. And they especially exist inside of immature people in high school.

381
00:37:02.16 --> 00:37:14.48
So that's the bad news. And then I said, but the good news is high school is not life.

382
00:37:17.36 --> 00:37:22.72
And when I said that, it was actually funny when I said that people started clapping because

383
00:37:22.72 --> 00:37:28.64
everyone in that room knew that it was true. And that reminded me of another

384
00:37:28.64 --> 00:37:36.24
conversation that I've been having with people lately about

385
00:37:38.72 --> 00:37:45.76
about ecosystems, something I've called ecosystems. So little ecosystems in the world that people

386
00:37:46.16 --> 00:37:56.40
get caught up in. And they get caught trying to get to the top hierarchy of some little ecosystem

387
00:37:56.40 --> 00:38:07.76
somewhere. And look, I get it. Jordan Peterson, we're trying to ascend the top of our

388
00:38:07.76 --> 00:38:17.92
dominance hierarchy. Be the best you can. I totally get that. Absolutely. But there can be a problem

389
00:38:17.92 --> 00:38:26.56
with this. From multiple angles. The world is filled with these little ecosystems. And high school is

390
00:38:26.56 --> 00:38:31.20
one of them. Remember the little high school ecosystem. There's someone that's popular. There's all

391
00:38:31.20 --> 00:38:38.48
these little eat. There's this ecosystem there. And high school, this is something. You look at

392
00:38:38.48 --> 00:38:42.56
high school kid and you try and explain to them that once you left high school, no one really cares.

393
00:38:42.56 --> 00:38:52.64
Right. Correct. If you care about it, deeply, you're actually on Carico. Right? If you're the one

394
00:38:52.64 --> 00:38:56.48
that's running around saying, when I was in high school this, when I was in high school that,

395
00:38:56.48 --> 00:38:59.68
but here's the problem. And this is one of the reasons when I wrote, way the warrior kid,

396
00:38:59.68 --> 00:39:04.96
the first one. One of the things that triggered me to write it was, you know, here I was at work,

397
00:39:04.96 --> 00:39:13.60
war going on, big real legitimate crazy problems and dynasties and dynamics to figure out.

398
00:39:13.60 --> 00:39:20.96
Things are going on. And I'd come home and like one of my kids would be sad that they got called

399
00:39:20.96 --> 00:39:28.88
the name or sad that they got a low grade or an attest or whatever. And I would be thinking,

400
00:39:28.88 --> 00:39:34.96
like I had a moment of clarity where I thought I can't believe they're sad about this, who cares?

401
00:39:35.52 --> 00:39:42.24
And then I realized, oh yeah, idiot, Jocco. That thing that's going on in their world is their

402
00:39:42.24 --> 00:39:47.68
whole world. It's the ego. See, it's their entire world is in that one ecosystem. So

403
00:39:50.48 --> 00:39:55.60
it's hard for people to realize that their ecosystem that they're in is not the whole world.

404
00:39:55.60 --> 00:39:59.12
It's the same thing when you start getting a college and I've got two kids in college now.

405
00:40:00.32 --> 00:40:04.16
This whole ecosystem around first getting into college and once you get to college,

406
00:40:04.16 --> 00:40:07.68
where you're going to get your MBA, where you're doing your internship, this is whole thing.

407
00:40:10.32 --> 00:40:15.60
And once again, if you step outside that ecosystem into just the normal world,

408
00:40:16.48 --> 00:40:22.96
no one actually cares about where you got your degree. Not no one, because there's a little

409
00:40:22.96 --> 00:40:27.52
people inside that ecosystem that they go, where do you get your MBA? Oh, where do you study?

410
00:40:27.52 --> 00:40:31.04
And there's people that care about that. There's other people that literally do not care at all.

411
00:40:32.48 --> 00:40:37.60
And I'm incredibly, like from that perspective, I'm incredibly successful business leaders all the time,

412
00:40:38.24 --> 00:40:44.64
that don't have their MBA and went to some state school in Iowa. I got props the other day

413
00:40:44.64 --> 00:40:49.52
from someone from Iowa and it said, whenever you think of that state, I'm like, yes, from Iowa,

414
00:40:49.52 --> 00:40:56.40
some state school and whatever, some little community college in Nebraska and they go out and

415
00:40:56.40 --> 00:41:00.16
world and dominate. So, but that's not important. We know that that happens.

416
00:41:00.16 --> 00:41:02.88
Look, and there's people that go to Ivy League schools and they do great too.

417
00:41:02.88 --> 00:41:07.20
But what I'm saying is they get into this little ecosystem where where what they're actually

418
00:41:07.20 --> 00:41:12.32
trying to do is climb to the top of that ecosystem only for the sake of climbing to the top of

419
00:41:12.32 --> 00:41:16.96
that ecosystem, not how it measures into the greater world. Well, kind of card you have.

420
00:41:16.96 --> 00:41:25.12
There's an ecosystem you can get wrapped up in. You know, I've got my Porsche's better than your Porsche.

421
00:41:27.60 --> 00:41:36.32
Right? There's people that are into that. And there's other people that I do not care at all at all.

422
00:41:41.60 --> 00:41:45.04
What about our little ecosystems? We're in it. Right? Would you just do has a little

423
00:41:45.04 --> 00:41:52.64
little ecosystem? You know what I'm saying? There's a little ecosystem who's who? The podcast world.

424
00:41:54.40 --> 00:42:00.16
Has an ecosystem. So all these, then those are just things that that you and I are actually

425
00:42:00.16 --> 00:42:06.80
actively in, right? We do get to and we have a podcast. So we could jump into like where you

426
00:42:06.80 --> 00:42:13.92
add on the hierarchy of these ecosystems. And again, Jordan, I get it. We're trying to, we're trying to

427
00:42:13.92 --> 00:42:22.32
go up the hierarchy. I get it. But you have to be able to put that in check. Because why are you doing that?

428
00:42:22.32 --> 00:42:27.52
What is driving you? If it's, if what's driving you to ascend that hierarchy is because it's going to

429
00:42:27.52 --> 00:42:31.04
make you better and the people around you better, that's good. If you're doing it for your own

430
00:42:31.04 --> 00:42:37.28
ego, though, that's a problem. That's where it becomes a problem. The, guess what? The jobs,

431
00:42:37.28 --> 00:42:44.56
the companies, the industries, they get created. They're sort of the jobs that get created by

432
00:42:44.56 --> 00:42:52.16
companies and industries. They have their own little ecosystem, right? About I work here, I work there,

433
00:42:52.16 --> 00:42:57.92
I will. I ran this region like you can see it. It's an ecosystem that exists. The seal teams

434
00:42:57.92 --> 00:43:03.84
is a freaking ecosystem. And everyone's in there going, you're like, okay, where are you at on the

435
00:43:03.84 --> 00:43:07.44
ecosystem? Where do we know? How many deployments have you done? Where did you deploy? Do. When

436
00:43:07.44 --> 00:43:11.20
what schools have you been to? There's a little ecosystem that people are trying to get up and it's

437
00:43:11.20 --> 00:43:15.04
and I get it. There's some positive to that, right? Because you're trying to do better, trying to work

438
00:43:15.04 --> 00:43:21.36
harder. That's good. Then there's, there's things, the bar scene. You probably can relate to this

439
00:43:21.36 --> 00:43:29.76
better than me. There's an ecosystem of the clubs. Yes. And who's the owner and who's the manager

440
00:43:29.76 --> 00:43:36.000
and who's the GM and who's the head door guy and who comes in here club. Oh, who are you going to

441
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:47.04
let in the club? Music scene, real estate. There's this ecosystems everywhere. And so this is the point

442
00:43:47.04 --> 00:43:52.72
that I guess I'm getting to and when ties back into this young female that asks this question.

443
00:43:52.72 --> 00:44:03.20
When you have to do is realize that in most of these cases, when you step outside of that little

444
00:44:03.20 --> 00:44:13.60
ecosystem, no one cares about that ecosystem. No one cares. No one cares. If I was to tell my mom,

445
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:20.16
hey mom, I got my black belt in GJ2 2005. Hey mom, I got my black belt in GJ2.

446
00:44:20.16 --> 00:44:26.000
What would you say? Congratulations. No one's thinking that I'm going to strip

447
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.60
mall doing karate somewhere. You know what I mean? That's what she's thinking. She doesn't care

448
00:44:31.60 --> 00:44:41.68
at all. She doesn't care at all. Your Porsche that you told me about, I can introduce you to many

449
00:44:41.68 --> 00:44:50.80
people that think if you spent more than $5,000 on a vehicle, you're an idiot. Never mind,

450
00:44:50.80 --> 00:44:57.20
$150,000. In fact, if you ever hear me brag about a vehicle, the vehicle that I brag about,

451
00:44:57.20 --> 00:45:03.04
probably the most is my 1997 Dodge Grand Carver. That's the one I brag about the most.

452
00:45:03.04 --> 00:45:10.96
So when you step outside the ecosystem of cool cars, people literally don't do not care.

453
00:45:14.32 --> 00:45:20.80
The music scene. Oh, I know this recording artist. I know, oh, I'm going to this studio. It's like,

454
00:45:20.80 --> 00:45:28.16
no one cares. So my point in saying this is if you find yourself distraught about your failure

455
00:45:28.16 --> 00:45:35.92
inside some random ecosystem, then remember that if you can detach and you can step outside

456
00:45:35.92 --> 00:45:42.40
that ecosystem, you can realize that that ecosystem, in most cases doesn't even matter at all. It doesn't matter

457
00:45:42.40 --> 00:45:53.76
at all. Detach. This is something that once again at Jockel Live shows this came up here. We

458
00:45:53.76 --> 00:46:01.12
talk about detachment. I talk about detachment or one of the things. Look, detachment is a great tool

459
00:46:01.12 --> 00:46:07.92
as a leader to have because it allows you to take a step back and see what's going on. Clearly,

460
00:46:07.92 --> 00:46:16.24
it's a powerful tool. But you combine that aspect of detachment to this other aspect of detachment

461
00:46:16.24 --> 00:46:22.80
when we've talked about people that get caught in a bad mental headspace and I don't know if I

462
00:46:22.80 --> 00:46:26.96
want to use the word depression because I'm not a psychologist and I've never really had this depression.

463
00:46:26.96 --> 00:46:32.16
So I can't really speak about it from that angle. But to say that people get caught in a rut,

464
00:46:32.16 --> 00:46:40.56
that happens. And I've talked about that idea. Like let's say, okay, when if you lose someone,

465
00:46:40.56 --> 00:46:48.24
right, someone that you know dies and you get put into that rut. And the way I've described it before

466
00:46:48.24 --> 00:46:52.88
is like there's a storm cloud all around your head. And no matter which direction you look, you see

467
00:46:52.88 --> 00:46:58.64
storm cloud. And anyone that's on the outside and this is what I've said, anyone that's on the outside,

468
00:46:58.64 --> 00:47:03.44
look, you go, oh man, you're just surrounded by the storm. If you step over here, you're going to

469
00:47:03.44 --> 00:47:08.08
get away from that. There's a light at the end of the tunnel. But from there perspective, they don't see it at

470
00:47:08.08 --> 00:47:17.92
all. If you can detach, if you can take a step back from your own head, you can actually see

471
00:47:17.92 --> 00:47:21.36
the end of the storm clouds and you can see that you can get your way out of this rut that you're in.

472
00:47:23.92 --> 00:47:31.84
Now people ask me about how to detach. And I talk about it leadership strategy and tactics,

473
00:47:31.84 --> 00:47:37.76
but I'm going to take a little bit further. Think about this. So here's a couple of things. And

474
00:47:37.76 --> 00:47:45.52
actually the reason that I I used to kind of look at it, like hey, it's real simple, right?

475
00:47:45.52 --> 00:47:49.92
Hey, take a step back. Just take a step back, take a breath, right? You know, look around.

476
00:47:49.92 --> 00:47:53.76
And in fact, relax, look around and make a call was what I wrote about extreme ownership when it

477
00:47:53.76 --> 00:48:02.88
comes to detach. Like relax, look around, make a call. That's detachment. The first time I really

478
00:48:02.88 --> 00:48:12.56
broke it down to try and give people some more specific instructions was on the warrior kid podcast.

479
00:48:12.56 --> 00:48:18.48
Because you know, a little kid would say, when I get mad, I start to lose my temper. When I'm

480
00:48:18.48 --> 00:48:23.68
wrestling or I start to lose my temper. When I'm in class and little Billy's keeps poking me

481
00:48:23.68 --> 00:48:28.40
in the back of the head. How do I not lose my temper? Well, what they need to do is detach. So

482
00:48:28.40 --> 00:48:34.40
I said, listen, take a step back. So I thought about what I kind of do. Take a step back.

483
00:48:34.40 --> 00:48:44.72
And one of the things I said was lift your chin up. Lift your chin up. And now when you start to think,

484
00:48:44.72 --> 00:48:49.52
I thought about, why do I even do that? What benefit does that have? Well, if you think about

485
00:48:49.52 --> 00:48:53.92
when you take a step back and you actually lift up your chin, think about what it does to your

486
00:48:53.92 --> 00:49:00.16
vision. All of a sudden, your vision is elevated. It's elevated one inch, but it's elevated. And you

487
00:49:00.16 --> 00:49:06.32
now have a physical new perspective. You have a physically new perspective of what's going on.

488
00:49:06.96 --> 00:49:12.24
If I take in a step back, lifting your chin up. The other thing it makes you do is if you put your

489
00:49:12.24 --> 00:49:17.84
head back, it like makes you open up your chest and open up your lungs and it makes you take a breath.

490
00:49:19.36 --> 00:49:24.48
Which I used to attribute this to when you're on the radio. Look, one of the reasons that I was

491
00:49:24.48 --> 00:49:29.52
that I like thought about detaching and something that I got realized was a good tool is you never

492
00:49:29.52 --> 00:49:36.16
want to sound panicked on the radio and the sealed teams. So before you key up that microphone

493
00:49:36.16 --> 00:49:42.24
to say something, you go when you say, all right, guys, we need to move towards that north building.

494
00:49:43.20 --> 00:49:46.24
Instead of, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You don't do that.

495
00:49:47.68 --> 00:49:54.32
So when you lift your chin up, you, you know, you kind of take a breath. It forces you to kind of take a breath.

496
00:49:54.32 --> 00:49:57.52
And the other, this is the coolest thing that I kind of connected this.

497
00:49:57.52 --> 00:50:03.44
Mm-hmm. At Jockel Live. And the reason I connected it because I was up like right now, we're

498
00:50:03.44 --> 00:50:08.32
sitting down and we're kind of, we're kind of stuck in this position. So at Jockel Live, I had

499
00:50:08.32 --> 00:50:13.44
like a, like a, a lava layer microphone on. It's all up and moving around and getting crazy.

500
00:50:13.84 --> 00:50:22.96
So as I was going through this, I was acting out the, the process of detaching. So I take a step

501
00:50:22.96 --> 00:50:29.68
back, I lift up my chin and I made this connection. I was like, think about the posture that you have

502
00:50:30.40 --> 00:50:37.84
when you're getting ready to get into a fight. It's literally the opposite. You lift up your hands,

503
00:50:37.84 --> 00:50:42.80
you duck, you tuck your chin down, you roll your shoulders forward to protect yourself,

504
00:50:42.80 --> 00:50:50.000
and you are getting in this defensive posture, which is not an open posture for seeing what's going on.

505
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.96
Right? It's a focused posture. When you take a step back, you lift up your chin. You're actually

506
00:50:54.96 --> 00:51:02.80
making yourself physically vulnerable. And what you're also doing is here. So you're opening

507
00:51:02.80 --> 00:51:10.40
yourself up the threats, but you're opening up your mind to see a different perspective. So

508
00:51:12.16 --> 00:51:19.60
that is incredibly important. It's an incredibly important first step in training yourself,

509
00:51:19.60 --> 00:51:24.72
how to detach from all this chaos that's going on from the mayhem of the leadership situation,

510
00:51:24.72 --> 00:51:30.16
to detaching from your own ecosystem that you're wrapped up in that you think is important.

511
00:51:30.16 --> 00:51:38.88
That no one cares about. No one cares about outside that stupid club you're in. No one cares.

512
00:51:40.32 --> 00:51:48.72
No one cares. Outside the, the, the, the, the 38 people that are involved in your

513
00:51:48.72 --> 00:51:57.44
glee club that they've got you paranoid and freaking out no one cares. So if you can take a step back

514
00:51:57.44 --> 00:52:01.92
and you can see that and finally, if you can take a step back from your own brain and you can kind of

515
00:52:01.92 --> 00:52:12.72
assess that cloud that you're caught in. You'll see that that cloud is not infinite and you'll see that

516
00:52:12.72 --> 00:52:23.76
there's a way out, which is important. Very important. Yeah, that, that, and that can get more

517
00:52:23.76 --> 00:52:29.44
strong and powerful that that lure that suck in like keeping you in your ecosystem one. It's like

518
00:52:29.44 --> 00:52:33.12
part of your routine, you know, because it kind of feeds into your identity a lot of times like

519
00:52:33.12 --> 00:52:38.48
in your gits is super strong like where you, you know, if you get tapped out by a guy who never

520
00:52:38.48 --> 00:52:42.16
taps you out of some breath. That'll follow you all the way home with your fat and you know,

521
00:52:42.16 --> 00:52:46.08
your family you're thinking man, they can tap me out today. Like you can, you know,

522
00:52:46.08 --> 00:52:48.72
it's going to be a line that's just sucked in because it's kind of part of your identity,

523
00:52:48.72 --> 00:52:55.76
whatever, but yeah, if you can just step back, look around, kind of detach from that,

524
00:52:55.76 --> 00:53:00.72
you're like, Brad, no one cares like every literally every other environment that you go in in life,

525
00:53:00.72 --> 00:53:04.24
nobody cares like I tap. No one cares that you even do gits. No one cares that you got a

526
00:53:04.24 --> 00:53:09.84
spring interaction at the store. Yeah, and what was that? This would just work magic.

527
00:53:09.84 --> 00:53:15.60
This is an ninja. You put that to sleep. Exactly. Which is probably never going to happen

528
00:53:15.60 --> 00:53:21.36
by the way, as far as probability goes. I think, and I think when you're younger, I mean,

529
00:53:21.36 --> 00:53:24.96
obviously when you're younger, you get you get caught up in the ecosystem. Oh, it's more.

530
00:53:24.96 --> 00:53:31.28
And this what's scary is this can be the downfall of a kid, right? You get caught up in the drug

531
00:53:31.28 --> 00:53:37.36
ecosystem. You get caught up in the booze ecosystem. You get caught up in the in the

532
00:53:38.80 --> 00:53:44.80
one is it delinquency. Like, hey, I'm going to cause problem. Hey, you know what do boys do?

533
00:53:45.76 --> 00:53:50.48
Boy, this is another thing that came out of jockel life. Like, boys are trying to prove themselves

534
00:53:51.44 --> 00:53:59.12
to their friends and to themselves. How tough they are, how cool they are. So whenever

535
00:53:59.12 --> 00:54:03.60
whatever little ecosystem has their own little cool meters in it, right? And sometimes that

536
00:54:03.60 --> 00:54:09.52
cool meter is, you know, I'm getting so I'm going to drink this fifth jack. Yeah.

537
00:54:11.12 --> 00:54:15.76
Or I'm going to smoke this or whatever. Like, that's they want to move up in that ecosystem.

538
00:54:15.76 --> 00:54:22.40
And so they do stuff that outside, outside that ecosystem, people are, hey, that's actually one of

539
00:54:22.40 --> 00:54:27.92
the dumbest things I've ever heard. Yeah. But you can't see that. Yeah, the party scene is a big one.

540
00:54:27.92 --> 00:54:32.08
I mean, there's a difference between like getting caught in the ecosystem of the party scene and then

541
00:54:32.08 --> 00:54:37.84
going down the spiral of drugs and addiction. A lot of time, the addiction is like, that's just like

542
00:54:37.84 --> 00:54:43.76
a chemical payoff you get. And then that chemical payoff you want so much. It's just more of a payoff

543
00:54:43.76 --> 00:54:47.84
than literally anything else in life and then it just compounds. But it's the ecosystem that

544
00:54:47.84 --> 00:54:51.28
introduces you to the payoff that ends up being an addiction that ends up ruining your life.

545
00:54:51.28 --> 00:54:55.68
Yes. So, yeah. Like, the party scene, for example, it's like, yeah, okay,

546
00:54:55.68 --> 00:54:59.60
did you go to this party? Oh, you didn't go to there. You're kind of less than kind of thing.

547
00:54:59.60 --> 00:55:03.60
You know, oh, I'm at all the parties. You're the kind of up there in that little ecosystem.

548
00:55:03.60 --> 00:55:07.36
Then you go to those parties and you got a function at the party. Right. So you can just go to the

549
00:55:07.36 --> 00:55:10.88
party. Like, no, I'm not drinking. And one of them, you're like, oh, you're not feeding in the

550
00:55:10.88 --> 00:55:14.32
party at all. So you're going to fit in. So you're going to do the, you know, you're obviously going to

551
00:55:14.32 --> 00:55:19.20
drink and then what if they're doing some some other drugs in the back room, the cool room, the

552
00:55:19.20 --> 00:55:23.44
VIP room, the secret room or whatever. If you're not part of that, you're sort of like, yeah, you're the

553
00:55:23.44 --> 00:55:27.12
minion. You're not one of the VIPs. You're one of the VIPs. You're going to function there.

554
00:55:27.12 --> 00:55:31.04
There's a whole peer pressure thing wrapped up inside the ecosystem. Oh, yeah. That's like the

555
00:55:31.04 --> 00:55:36.16
primary driver of the ecosystem. Oh, yeah. Because even the positive things like, oh, where you get,

556
00:55:36.16 --> 00:55:41.20
where you, where you're getting your MBA? Yeah. Like, so like, got all these 18, well,

557
00:55:41.20 --> 00:55:46.24
no, 19, whatever, 20, 21 year old college kids are like, where you're going to get your MBA?

558
00:55:46.24 --> 00:55:49.52
Where you're going to get your MBA? Where you're flying? Where you're flying? Where you're flying?

559
00:55:49.52 --> 00:55:55.68
Oh, yeah. And if you're not applying to the whatever, then you're a little bit down on the

560
00:55:55.68 --> 00:56:01.36
ecosystem. And you know what? No one cares. Well, I can't say no one cares. Because there are

561
00:56:01.36 --> 00:56:07.12
people that are going, hey, we want to get someone from this school. Cool. Fine. That's a little tiny

562
00:56:07.12 --> 00:56:11.52
subset of the same ecosystem. Yeah. And but if you're talking about like, yeah, if you're talking

563
00:56:11.52 --> 00:56:16.56
about people outside the ecosystem, no, they don't care. They don't care if you're capable. And then

564
00:56:16.56 --> 00:56:20.08
so a lot of times, if you're like, oh, you got MBA from here. Okay, that's an established kid,

565
00:56:20.08 --> 00:56:24.48
you know, capable. They're going to put out some good students or some good trained people,

566
00:56:24.48 --> 00:56:28.88
whatever, then there's that. But it's not like, they don't care about what you care about right now.

567
00:56:28.88 --> 00:56:33.12
You know, the fact that you got it from here doesn't mean you're like awesome. The thing that's so

568
00:56:33.12 --> 00:56:40.24
hard for kids is they just can't see outside the ecosystem is their world. Yeah. And so

569
00:56:40.24 --> 00:56:46.000
introducing people to this concept that there are in fact, the random ecosystems that actually

570
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:53.60
no one cares about is a positive thing. Yeah. Don't get caught up in them. Yeah. Don't keep caught

571
00:56:53.60 --> 00:56:59.04
on the trend. Yeah. Especially not negative ones. But yeah, what there's also people take positive

572
00:56:59.76 --> 00:57:04.000
ecosystems and turn them negative because they start getting the ego involved. Like,

573
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.20
like, that's the right. Jiu-Jitsu is totally positive ecosystem. Hey, we're just here to train. We're

574
00:57:07.20 --> 00:57:11.36
here to have fun. And normal son, it turns into drama. As we haven't talked too much about the

575
00:57:11.36 --> 00:57:15.68
Jiu-Jitsu drama. And I, but you honest with you, one of the reasons that we don't talk a lot about the

576
00:57:15.68 --> 00:57:21.20
Jiu-Jitsu drama is probably because we don't deal with it a lot because we have a very open door

577
00:57:21.20 --> 00:57:27.04
policy at our gym. And we're just kind of cool. And we just want to train Jiu-Jitsu and

578
00:57:27.04 --> 00:57:31.76
want everyone else to train Jiu-Jitsu. And I think San Diego at large is a very similar to that

579
00:57:31.76 --> 00:57:37.52
because they're just Jiu-Jitsu everywhere. So we all just kind of know each other. And so I think that

580
00:57:37.52 --> 00:57:43.20
has something to do with it. And I also think there's less Jiu-Jitsu drama now than there was 10 years ago.

581
00:57:43.20 --> 00:57:47.60
Yeah, for sure. You know, 10 years ago is like, that's my student. You went to my other. You went

582
00:57:47.60 --> 00:57:51.20
to someone else's academy. Cool. You're out of my academy forever. I banish you.

583
00:57:53.20 --> 00:57:56.80
That was that kind of drama. Is there still that kind of drama? They're probably as some,

584
00:57:56.80 --> 00:58:02.56
but not as bad as it used to be. But they took a positive ecosystem and turned it into negative

585
00:58:02.56 --> 00:58:07.92
ecosystem. Yeah. Yeah, I would imagine that's kind of everything. Like even, okay, so my nephew

586
00:58:07.92 --> 00:58:12.16
gets good grades. Really good grades. But he takes it, you know how like certain students,

587
00:58:12.16 --> 00:58:17.20
they take their grades like super-series. They get one bag or their late for school. Like,

588
00:58:17.20 --> 00:58:21.92
proud of it. If to me, if let's say my mom brought me to school.

589
00:58:21.92 --> 00:58:25.84
But if you have to explain to me that you weren't worried about being late when you were 10,

590
00:58:26.48 --> 00:58:31.52
it's unnecessary. You're going wildly unnecessary for them. For the people,

591
00:58:31.52 --> 00:58:35.60
we'll let you explain how much you didn't care about leaving late even as a child. Go out.

592
00:58:37.20 --> 00:58:41.60
Especially for school. But in this way, if I was late, had to get a tardy slip.

593
00:58:42.40 --> 00:58:47.84
Brother, the connection between that and like grades and success in life was literally nonexistent.

594
00:58:47.84 --> 00:58:52.72
Brother, yeah. So in this way, it looks like the boss was late on. I would say,

595
00:58:52.72 --> 00:58:57.28
maybe that's how you ended up showing up late all the time. But God did it possible. Did you?

596
00:58:57.28 --> 00:59:02.32
Very possible. So if my parents were my mom or dad or whatever, if they were driving me to school,

597
00:59:02.32 --> 00:59:07.68
and they were running late? Well, I mean, me caring was literally at a zero. I didn't care at all.

598
00:59:07.68 --> 00:59:13.12
And that goes like, cool. I don't have to spend as much time at school. And not that I was bad at school or anything.

599
00:59:13.12 --> 00:59:16.24
I'm just saying like, right. I didn't care about that stuff at all. Anyway, my point is,

600
00:59:16.24 --> 00:59:20.80
some people are in the opposite. Some people were like, I can be late for school. It's like school is like everything in their grades.

601
00:59:20.80 --> 00:59:23.52
And stuff like that. That's positive. That's really good. Actually,

602
00:59:23.52 --> 00:59:29.12
but it can get out of hand. It's a thing. It's got to hand. Where you get kids freaking. You get kids cheating.

603
00:59:29.12 --> 00:59:31.28
Cheating, freaking out. Freaking out. Freaking out.

604
00:59:31.28 --> 00:59:36.56
Now, taking weird drugs to like study like a lot of whatever. Yeah. All those things. All those things are bad.

605
00:59:36.56 --> 00:59:40.40
And all of them are related to the fact that they think that that ecosystem is the whole world.

606
00:59:40.40 --> 00:59:46.96
Everything. And let's be honest. I mean, how much of that ecosystem affect you? You didn't even show up at school.

607
00:59:47.68 --> 00:59:50.56
What do you want me homework? You seem to be doing all right?

608
00:59:50.56 --> 00:59:55.52
I'm not even. Well, now you're here kicking the podcast ecosystem. Echo Jaws.

609
00:59:56.08 --> 01:00:04.48
Oh, yeah. So everyone should do that. Right. No, man. Yeah, crazy. Yeah, I think if if you take

610
01:00:05.28 --> 01:00:10.48
and not not that I'm like the epitome of or the poster child for great parenting advice,

611
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:16.40
nothing like this, but I think like the more you take your kids and see other stuff outside of school.

612
01:00:16.40 --> 01:00:21.60
Kind of their mind is going to not just be attached to like the school scenario. You know? Well, that's a whole

613
01:00:22.48 --> 01:00:27.28
debate, you know, that you could have like, but here's a real simple question.

614
01:00:28.16 --> 01:00:32.72
Is your kid, if your kid goes, is your kid 10 years old, they're in fifth grade.

615
01:00:33.52 --> 01:00:37.28
And they don't want to miss school. So they don't go with you to,

616
01:00:38.56 --> 01:00:44.88
call it, whatever, cry. They don't go experience something. Like, yeah, that I guarantee you that the

617
01:00:44.88 --> 01:00:52.24
experience in Kauai is way more beneficial, educationally, spiritually,

618
01:00:53.28 --> 01:01:00.56
athletically, then hey, they missed three days of math. Yeah, bring the math book.

619
01:01:00.56 --> 01:01:06.72
Bring it. Yeah, for sure. And that's just Kauai either. Like, you know, I mean, even just going to

620
01:01:06.72 --> 01:01:14.96
see what you do at work or whatever, like I just take my kid to, you know, going training sites.

621
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.64
Are you kidding me? Best thing ever. Oh, yeah. And I'm not even necessarily saying have a

622
01:01:20.64 --> 01:01:25.20
miss school to see this stuff. I'm not necessarily saying that. But I'm just saying like,

623
01:01:25.20 --> 01:01:29.44
everything isn't like, okay, go home, do homework. And it's like everything. If you

624
01:01:29.44 --> 01:01:36.24
create this idea that school is everything in their head, then, you know, it's, they're going to

625
01:01:36.24 --> 01:01:42.32
tend to think that I think. But, you know, if you see, you know, let them see other places where you

626
01:01:42.32 --> 01:01:45.84
work or whatever, whether you're in the weekends or summertime or whatever, you know, see just the

627
01:01:45.84 --> 01:01:49.92
other things that it realized, okay, school isn't everything, you know. And what you're really showing

628
01:01:49.92 --> 01:01:55.20
them is this is one ecosystem in the world. It's called school. It's an important one, but there's

629
01:01:55.20 --> 01:02:01.04
no reason to get crazy. There's other ecosystems out there that are also cool and good.

630
01:02:03.28 --> 01:02:12.72
All right, keep detached. Don't get stuck in ecosystems. All right, next question. I am stuck in a

631
01:02:12.72 --> 01:02:19.44
prolonged period of things not going my way professionally or socially. All that really is going on.

632
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:26.40
Well, is my time management still, even after having owned up to my part in getting here,

633
01:02:26.40 --> 01:02:38.56
I still seem stuck in a failure loop. Okay, so, what's being addressed here is

634
01:02:40.08 --> 01:02:46.96
the prolonged period of things not going away. And we know that a key part of getting out of a

635
01:02:46.96 --> 01:02:55.20
rut like this or a failure loop is taking ownership of those failures of those problems.

636
01:02:58.08 --> 01:03:05.44
That's very important. But guess what? That alone doesn't solve them at all.

637
01:03:06.72 --> 01:03:14.000
Just saying I didn't get promoted. Okay, it was my fault. Period. That doesn't solve the fact that you didn't

638
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.88
get promoted. I'm not getting called back to do this other contracting job. It's my fault.

639
01:03:20.88 --> 01:03:23.52
Does that mean you get called back? No, it doesn't mean anything.

640
01:03:26.08 --> 01:03:32.56
Taking ownership means that you actually have to identify the problem. You know your

641
01:03:32.56 --> 01:03:37.68
responsible for it. And then you actually have to solve the problem. That's what you have to do.

642
01:03:37.68 --> 01:03:40.56
Just taking ownership of the problem doesn't make it go away. If you take ownership of the

643
01:03:40.56 --> 01:03:44.000
problem, you have to take ownership of finding a solution. And then you have to take ownership

644
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.28
of implementing that solution. So this is real straightforward. Now, there's one little tiny part

645
01:03:51.28 --> 01:03:57.04
that I want to point out, which you may or may not have noticed echo Charles and I'm going to point it out.

646
01:03:58.16 --> 01:04:06.88
So pay attention to this last sentence in the question. Still, even after having owned up to

647
01:04:06.88 --> 01:04:14.72
my part in getting here, I still seem stuck in a failure. Failure loop. What you noticed about

648
01:04:14.72 --> 01:04:20.40
that echo Charles? As if there's another part of all of the part, maybe even parts.

649
01:04:20.40 --> 01:04:29.92
Right, there's multiple facets of the world that are conspiring to keep you in this failure loop.

650
01:04:29.92 --> 01:04:35.20
Yeah, it's like that tone of when someone's like, hey, I did my part. I did my job hands-up,

651
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:39.60
you know, kind of thing. I did my job. That's not my job. The other parts that are more implied,

652
01:04:39.60 --> 01:04:43.36
I guess, now that you kind of uncover in the world. It's like there's this other job that someone

653
01:04:43.36 --> 01:04:50.40
else is sort of part. So this is the thing. And this is what this is what makes this very challenging.

654
01:04:51.36 --> 01:05:03.12
Is this idea that like, but how could I possibly control this or that? How can I possibly

655
01:05:03.12 --> 01:05:09.20
take ownership of the fact now? This is a weak one. How can I possibly take ownership of the fact

656
01:05:09.20 --> 01:05:16.40
that my boss is an idiot and fired me? How can that be my fault? That he didn't see how good I was,

657
01:05:16.40 --> 01:05:21.12
right? Okay, we see what's going on there. You obviously aren't being introspective and taking a

658
01:05:21.12 --> 01:05:27.28
look and saying, okay, this is obviously my fault. Here's what I need to change. So there's things

659
01:05:27.28 --> 01:05:34.96
like that where you go, look, you're just not, it was same thing with relationships, right? She broke

660
01:05:34.96 --> 01:05:40.48
up with me. How can I own that? Well, maybe you look at yourself and you see how you acted as a

661
01:05:40.48 --> 01:05:45.52
partner in that relationship. And if you just want to look at that person, say it was her fault,

662
01:05:45.52 --> 01:05:54.56
she was crazy. And it was her fault, she didn't understand how awesome I was. That's not, that you,

663
01:05:54.56 --> 01:06:00.88
you need to take ownership of your own behavior. Why did she think that? Now you do get to these

664
01:06:00.88 --> 01:06:17.52
things where you have no control. So got asked a question, a guy said, my, I lost my girlfriend to

665
01:06:17.52 --> 01:06:27.44
you, opiate overdose, did she died? How do I take ownership of that? And so I expanded that

666
01:06:27.44 --> 01:06:32.56
question because that's one of those things where you look at, you know, when you look at,

667
01:06:32.56 --> 01:06:39.20
you go, how can you take ownership of that? This person did so much drugs and it wasn't like,

668
01:06:40.40 --> 01:06:45.60
like, okay, I don't know the specifics of the situation, but if you know, I'm doing everything

669
01:06:45.60 --> 01:06:53.04
I can to help my girlfriend and then one day I come home and she's, oh, deed, she's dead.

670
01:06:53.68 --> 01:07:01.04
Okay, how can I say, I wasn't even there, right? And I, let's just say, I've done everything,

671
01:07:01.04 --> 01:07:07.52
take her to rehab, not all this stuff. And as far as I could tell, she was clean and behind my

672
01:07:07.52 --> 01:07:11.20
back without telling me, at least she did this, right? So it's almost like, okay, that's as much

673
01:07:11.20 --> 01:07:17.44
separation as I can get. How do you take ownership of a situation like that? And so it

674
01:07:17.44 --> 01:07:24.16
here's what I went on to say to this guy. I said this might seem like a unique situation, but it's

675
01:07:24.16 --> 01:07:29.12
not because there's things that occur in our lives that we actually don't have any control over.

676
01:07:29.12 --> 01:07:36.64
For instance, most horrible, you, your family member, someone, you know, gets cancer, gets a

677
01:07:36.64 --> 01:07:43.52
horrible, terminal disease. How do you take ownership of that? And the answer is, in these cases,

678
01:07:45.04 --> 01:07:51.76
when things that are truly beyond your control occur, what you take ownership of is how you respond to them.

679
01:07:53.68 --> 01:08:00.08
That's, that's what you take ownership. How do you respond to, you lose your girlfriend to drugs,

680
01:08:00.08 --> 01:08:05.92
your kid gets cancer, you get cancer, something, you get this horrible disease. How do you respond to that?

681
01:08:05.92 --> 01:08:10.000
That's what you can take ownership of. And that's what you have to take ownership of.

682
01:08:11.12 --> 01:08:17.36
So I get, as my point in saying that is, yes, there are absolutely things that you cannot control

683
01:08:17.36 --> 01:08:23.60
and what you can control is your reaction to them when they unfold. That makes sense. What scares me

684
01:08:23.60 --> 01:08:32.40
about this guy is he's saying he's owned up to his part, but that means he's blaming someone else.

685
01:08:32.40 --> 01:08:39.60
And I can, the amount of things that we have is zero control over is a very small. So many things

686
01:08:39.60 --> 01:08:44.64
if we look at ourselves and say, what could I do better, what could I do different? How can I make an adjustment here?

687
01:08:46.24 --> 01:08:53.36
How can I adapt to the way this boss is? How can I adapt to the way this girl is that I'm trying to have

688
01:08:53.36 --> 01:08:57.20
relationship and then by the way, that might not be the best relationship. Maybe that's part of what you need to do.

689
01:08:57.20 --> 01:09:02.40
This take ownership of the fact that you're addicted to this, this is what he's saying. This guy

690
01:09:02.40 --> 01:09:06.96
here saying he's so social, some of his, some of his got some problems with his

691
01:09:08.40 --> 01:09:14.24
female friends, right? Or friends in general. Hey, do you want to want to come watch UFC?

692
01:09:14.24 --> 01:09:18.72
Oh, not really. I'm buying guys. That's okay. We're going to go to, you know,

693
01:09:20.56 --> 01:09:26.40
oh, is there a watch that by myself? I can't believe that. You know, what's wrong with everyone else?

694
01:09:26.40 --> 01:09:32.96
No, actually, what's wrong with me? Now truth be told. I don't want to watch UFC with anybody else,

695
01:09:32.96 --> 01:09:39.84
generally. I just want to sit alone and watch the fight. No commentary. No questions.

696
01:09:39.84 --> 01:09:45.44
I asked me a question. Sure. What was that move? No. I'm watching the fight.

697
01:09:46.48 --> 01:09:51.20
That's interesting. Everyone just be quiet. A lot of times, some of us, we like to demonstrate our

698
01:09:51.20 --> 01:10:02.48
professional knowledge of the subject, you know? So answer here. You need to look at the reason

699
01:10:02.48 --> 01:10:07.52
that you're probably stuck in this loop continually is because the things that you're

700
01:10:07.52 --> 01:10:12.56
blaming on other people take ownership of them, get them fixed, take ownership of them, get

701
01:10:12.56 --> 01:10:16.72
them fixed, take ownership of make some moves, take ownership of them, look what you can do different.

702
01:10:16.72 --> 01:10:31.12
That's what you have to do. Jack, so. Next question. In your recent book,

703
01:10:31.12 --> 01:10:35.52
Leadership Strategy and Tactics mentioned establishing trustworthy relationships with

704
01:10:35.52 --> 01:10:41.76
superiors, you speak of performance and compelling tasks. You're stating tasks. Oh,

705
01:10:41.76 --> 01:10:46.80
completing tasks. Yes. Performance and completing tasks. You stated, boss wants me to fill out some

706
01:10:46.80 --> 01:10:52.96
extra paperwork. I'll do it. Boss needs me to cover a shift for someone else on the team. I've got

707
01:10:52.96 --> 01:10:59.20
it. Boss has a nasty low reward mission that needs executing. I'm all over it, page 40 and 50.

708
01:11:00.16 --> 01:11:04.64
How does this separate you from being a yes man, especially when being a yes man is looked

709
01:11:05.04 --> 01:11:09.44
upon so negatively these days? What are your thoughts? Yes, so there's actually maybe he hasn't

710
01:11:09.44 --> 01:11:14.08
gotten there, but there's a whole section in the book that's called the S-Man. And why you don't

711
01:11:14.08 --> 01:11:20.08
want to be a yes man? Because if you're a yes man, you don't push back when a situation requires

712
01:11:20.08 --> 01:11:29.28
there to be pushed back. So, read a little bit more, but to make it quite simple,

713
01:11:30.80 --> 01:11:34.64
being a yes man is saying yes to everything regardless of whether it's a good idea or not.

714
01:11:34.64 --> 01:11:44.000
Building relationships and establishing a good communication and a good rapport with your

715
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.68
superior is totally different than being a yes man. Part of it is saying yes, because if you resist

716
01:11:49.68 --> 01:11:54.16
everything that they say to you, they don't really think they don't really value your opinion. They

717
01:11:54.16 --> 01:11:59.28
just know that you're just a no man, no we can't do no can't, you're your Mr. Negative.

718
01:11:59.28 --> 01:12:05.12
Mr. A yes man is just going to do whatever. So what you do is you say yes when you can.

719
01:12:06.16 --> 01:12:10.16
Some meanial tasks, as we talk about some extra paperwork, cool, I'll do it. Some some

720
01:12:10.16 --> 01:12:13.84
cover shift for someone else's cool, I got it. I can do those things. Those are easy. They're

721
01:12:13.84 --> 01:12:19.76
not impacting my team. We're good. Nasty, low reward project that needs to get done cool, I got it.

722
01:12:19.76 --> 01:12:23.36
Let's go bring it. Bring it. I'm here. It's going to help the team. Awesome.

723
01:12:23.36 --> 01:12:30.56
Oh, you want me to do something that's going to negatively affect the team and put massive amounts

724
01:12:30.56 --> 01:12:36.32
of capital at jeopardy or put people in risk or put safety at risk. Do I want me to do that? Hold on,

725
01:12:36.32 --> 01:12:43.60
boss. No. And I wouldn't be just no boss. I'm not doing it. But I go through the book. How you

726
01:12:43.60 --> 01:12:50.16
actually approach those situations so that you're not a yes man. So when it comes to situations

727
01:12:50.16 --> 01:12:56.88
that unfolds that you actually need to say no, you can say no and it gets listened to.

728
01:12:58.40 --> 01:13:04.72
That's the difference. Leadership strategy, intacters get some. So when they're kind of,

729
01:13:05.92 --> 01:13:10.16
so many of the questions, Ian leadership strategy and tactics, there's so many of the answers

730
01:13:10.16 --> 01:13:16.96
that I'd given there are based on questions that I get asked all the time. And so really, so many

731
01:13:16.96 --> 01:13:21.28
of the questions that I'm hearing now, I have the answer and leadership strategy and tactics.

732
01:13:21.28 --> 01:13:26.56
I'm trying not to just say, well, refer to the book. It's 98. Oh, refer to the book page 64.

733
01:13:27.12 --> 01:13:33.92
I'm trying not to do that. But just FYI, refer anyone that's out there. It's in there. Read more about it.

734
01:13:35.68 --> 01:13:40.80
All right. Next question. I was hoping for some guy, kind of a similar question. Two.

735
01:13:40.80 --> 01:13:45.20
But go on. Yes. Let's bring first some guy. I'm going to cut you off again. No, I just did that

736
01:13:45.20 --> 01:13:54.48
for fun. I thought I did it. Anyway, I was hoping for some guidance on how to play the game

737
01:13:55.20 --> 01:14:01.04
with a situation at work. I work in an aerospace machine shop. I'm doing this apprenticeship to be a

738
01:14:01.04 --> 01:14:08.24
machinist. Machinist, machinist, machinist. This means that I'm supposed to get specific types of

739
01:14:08.24 --> 01:14:16.40
on the job training with a set number of hours each with a set number of hours each. Okay. I go to school.

740
01:14:16.40 --> 01:14:20.40
Once we're going to re-roll this thing, huh? No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going to roll it. Yeah,

741
01:14:20.40 --> 01:14:25.28
hey, you know, I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. Decern kind of what he's asking at the end of the day.

742
01:14:25.28 --> 01:14:28.64
Anyway, set numbers are normally you get a little sensitive if you make some mistakes. I

743
01:14:28.64 --> 01:14:32.08
am just going to take this from the top. But my whole life is at one weakness. Take so put

744
01:14:32.08 --> 01:14:39.52
in. Come on. It's an expression. Anyway, I go to school once a week to supplement it. The problem is

745
01:14:39.52 --> 01:14:46.08
they won't give me any work that feels those designations. I'm doing my best at the

746
01:14:46.08 --> 01:14:51.04
menial paperwork they've had had me on for a while without complaint. It's a real problem, though.

747
01:14:51.76 --> 01:14:57.20
When I'm paying out of pocket for this tuition, they come with the program. Every month spent,

748
01:14:57.20 --> 01:15:02.48
not getting required training ads to the five years it takes to complete the OJT on the job training.

749
01:15:03.84 --> 01:15:09.04
How do I get them to move me where I'm supposed to be? Do I just continue to do the best at what

750
01:15:09.04 --> 01:15:13.60
they give me? I'm going to accept the loss of time and money. Yeah, so you can remember the book

751
01:15:13.60 --> 01:15:18.48
that I caught me of leadership humble, not passive. So this guy is being humble playing the game.

752
01:15:18.48 --> 01:15:22.88
Hey, I'll do the medial paperwork. I'll all work these extra hours. I'll do these things that

753
01:15:22.88 --> 01:15:28.48
don't really help me. He's playing the game and he's being humble, right? But he's also it sounds like

754
01:15:28.48 --> 01:15:34.56
being passive, meaning he needs to up his assertiveness to say, hey, listen, hey, hey, boss, I just

755
01:15:34.56 --> 01:15:39.04
want to let you know. I put together this spreadsheet of what I've actually get to get accomplished.

756
01:15:39.04 --> 01:15:41.76
And here's the things that I want to get done and I know I'm trying to knock out all the

757
01:15:41.76 --> 01:15:46.72
stuff and I'm here to support the team. But I also need to get these things done. Can you help me

758
01:15:46.72 --> 01:15:53.44
get these things scheduled so that I can be more value to you and the team? So yeah, you build the

759
01:15:53.44 --> 01:15:59.84
relationship through playing the game. You build the relationship by giving support wherever you can,

760
01:15:59.84 --> 01:16:05.60
but at the same time, that doesn't mean that you just roll over and never stand up for yourself.

761
01:16:06.48 --> 01:16:11.84
That's not what we're talking about here. The difference is you're not building a relationship just

762
01:16:11.84 --> 01:16:17.28
so you can take care of yourself, right? That's different. That means I'm just looking out for me.

763
01:16:17.28 --> 01:16:21.60
You're building a relationship so that you can move down the right path, which by the way is going to

764
01:16:21.60 --> 01:16:28.88
make you more a bigger asset to the team. So it's a win-win situation. Make sure you build that

765
01:16:28.88 --> 01:16:32.16
relationship and then talk to them about what is you're trying to get done, why you're trying to get

766
01:16:32.16 --> 01:16:37.12
it done? And that way we move forward down the path. And by the way, if they're like shut up and just

767
01:16:37.12 --> 01:16:42.16
do this paperwork or shut up, we're not going to help you. Cool. Maybe we need to find a place that

768
01:16:42.16 --> 01:16:51.20
has a little bit better opportunity for me and I'll start to float that out there. Humble, not passive.

769
01:16:52.08 --> 01:16:58.72
I remember a long time ago you'd say, you used this word efficient. Be more efficient,

770
01:16:58.72 --> 01:17:02.56
rather than make it easier for me, even though they're essentially the same thing in certain

771
01:17:02.56 --> 01:17:06.56
circumstances where it's like, oh yeah, this will make it easier for me to become an asset,

772
01:17:06.56 --> 01:17:10.96
kind of thing. But for whatever reason maybe just the way that sounds. Yeah, sounds like you're

773
01:17:10.96 --> 01:17:17.28
not for yourself, man. Yeah. Yeah. But if you say, it'll get me to be a more valuable asset in a

774
01:17:17.28 --> 01:17:23.36
more efficient way. Who could say no to that? Because what company doesn't want efficiency? No,

775
01:17:23.36 --> 01:17:29.36
we want to take the hard road. We want to do things that don't make any sense. We want to do things

776
01:17:29.36 --> 01:17:38.32
inefficient way. No. Yes, efficiency is important. Not only in GJ2, not only in judo, but in business

777
01:17:38.32 --> 01:17:48.24
of life. Yes, sir. All right. So there's one more little topic that I wanted to bring up. And

778
01:17:49.76 --> 01:17:54.56
really it's another question that I got at Jockel Live and I got this

779
01:17:54.56 --> 01:18:04.48
question or a version of this question a couple of different times and they all, they all.

780
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.80
Couple different versions of this question but the same question. And the question is,

781
01:18:08.80 --> 01:18:16.16
it's something like this, something along the lines of, I've been pretty successful at this point

782
01:18:16.16 --> 01:18:27.52
in my life. And I'm having trouble finding the motivation to take it to the next level.

783
01:18:28.64 --> 01:18:33.28
So you know, it's like people say, oh, so you know, you make decent money, yep, but we got,

784
01:18:33.28 --> 01:18:37.04
yeah, we're doing really well and you're working out, yep, I'm going to healthy, yep,

785
01:18:37.04 --> 01:18:40.08
I'm good, yeah, you're family's taking care of you out, I'm good, good, good time with my family.

786
01:18:40.08 --> 01:18:47.52
But you're not able to like get the extra workout, you're not, you know, you're skipping some days,

787
01:18:47.52 --> 01:18:51.52
you're not eating great, you're not making the calls that you need to make, you're not expanding your

788
01:18:51.52 --> 01:18:55.36
eyes and that's what's going on, right? And so that's what we're getting at. We get someone that's sort of

789
01:18:55.36 --> 01:19:00.80
in a good spot, kind of across the board, right? Kind of in a good spot across the board. And so I'd

790
01:19:00.80 --> 01:19:06.88
kind of establish that fact that they're in a good spot across the board. And then I'd say,

791
01:19:06.88 --> 01:19:12.80
but it sounds like you're in a good spot across the board, are you happy with that and are you

792
01:19:12.80 --> 01:19:23.68
comfortable with where you're at? And the answer would be no. And then I'd say, are you sure?

793
01:19:23.68 --> 01:19:44.96
And then it's a yam, sure, I want to do more. And then I said, that's a lie. That's a lie. That's a lie,

794
01:19:44.96 --> 01:19:52.56
because if you really weren't happy and you really wanted to improve your health even more

795
01:19:52.56 --> 01:19:57.52
and you really wanted to improve your financial situation more. And you really wanted to just

796
01:19:57.52 --> 01:20:06.48
broadly improve your life, then you wouldn't have any problem at all finding the discipline.

797
01:20:06.48 --> 01:20:14.56
The discipline would actually find you. That's where I'm at. You want to know why people

798
01:20:14.56 --> 01:20:19.68
go, you don't see pretty much, you want to know why? Because this one finds me, because I know

799
01:20:19.68 --> 01:20:24.40
I know I can do more. And I want to do more. And I know I'm not happy or I'm at a comfortable

800
01:20:24.40 --> 01:20:30.88
where I'm at. So if you're telling yourself, no, I'm not happy where you're at, then I'm going

801
01:20:30.88 --> 01:20:35.76
to tell you that's actually a lie. You are comfortable. You are comfortable, because if you

802
01:20:35.76 --> 01:20:43.92
weren't comfortable, then it would drive you the discipline would show up. Now this is where

803
01:20:43.92 --> 01:20:53.28
I kind of, I kind of have to go a little bit deeper. So what I just said, if you tell yourself

804
01:20:53.28 --> 01:21:02.48
the truth, then you'll find discipline. The framework of discipline is the truth.

805
01:21:04.48 --> 01:21:12.08
The framework of discipline is the truth. And I didn't do a good job when I got to ask this

806
01:21:12.08 --> 01:21:18.56
question. I didn't do a good job of connecting all the dots because it actually is one level deeper.

807
01:21:21.52 --> 01:21:30.08
It's one level deeper. It looks like this. If you're saying that you can't find discipline

808
01:21:32.40 --> 01:21:37.92
and I'm telling you it's because that's because you are comfortable where you're at.

809
01:21:37.92 --> 01:21:51.12
That is also a lie. That is also a lie. Look, telling yourself that

810
01:21:52.72 --> 01:21:57.12
you don't need to get out of bed in the morning, telling yourself that you don't really need to

811
01:21:57.12 --> 01:22:03.12
work out or you don't need to go harger or you don't need to do more in your job or be more

812
01:22:03.12 --> 01:22:12.16
disciplined in the way that you live. If you tell yourself those things, that's actually a lie.

813
01:22:17.60 --> 01:22:23.68
Because the fact of the matter is, think about this, the fact of the matter is that you're not

814
01:22:23.68 --> 01:22:30.96
comfortable. You're not happy. You're not okay with where you're up because that's why you're asking

815
01:22:30.96 --> 01:22:38.40
this question right now. You're asking this question because you know you can do more. You know

816
01:22:38.40 --> 01:22:48.16
you can be more and that's the truth. That's the truth and it eats you up and it makes you

817
01:22:48.16 --> 01:22:56.000
ask these questions, ask the question to me and ask the question to yourself and the answer is the truth.

818
01:22:59.44 --> 01:23:06.000
You know it, I know it, we all know it that the framework of discipline is the truth.

819
01:23:09.28 --> 01:23:17.28
If you tell yourself the truth, the real truth, the absolute categorical, unconditional,

820
01:23:17.28 --> 01:23:23.76
unabated, unmersible truth. If you do that, you will find discipline.

821
01:23:28.96 --> 01:23:35.76
Discipline equals freedom. Discipline is rooted in the truth. The truth will set you free.

822
01:23:35.76 --> 01:23:50.32
And what does that calculus work out to? Discipline equals freedom. And I think that's

823
01:23:52.08 --> 01:24:03.28
all I've got for tonight. So, echo Charles. It seems like we want the truth over here.

824
01:24:03.28 --> 01:24:10.56
Yes. So that we can do more and we can be more. Is there anything that you know of

825
01:24:11.44 --> 01:24:24.16
that helps reveal the truth to us? Yes, due to the facts never lie. When you make eye contact with

826
01:24:24.16 --> 01:24:31.12
that guy who's little bit better than you, maybe bigger, maybe we'll give you a scenario where you

827
01:24:31.12 --> 01:24:35.20
got to put out more effort that maybe you want to do that day when you make eye contact and then you

828
01:24:35.20 --> 01:24:43.44
like look away. Oh, you mean pre-roll. Oh, there's like a scenario that could unfold but we haven't

829
01:24:43.44 --> 01:24:53.28
connected eye contact for the role. It's like avoidance. Yeah, oh, everybody knows. That's one of

830
01:24:53.28 --> 01:25:02.24
the many attempted lies that we sort of try to perpetuate in ourselves. Like, oh yeah, like, I'm good,

831
01:25:02.24 --> 01:25:10.40
right? That's what people kind of. They want to be good at jujitsu, I think, you know, on the mat's,

832
01:25:10.40 --> 01:25:18.40
you know Akbar? Sure, of course it did. Yeah. He's really sick jujitsu and he's super like hard to

833
01:25:18.40 --> 01:25:24.56
roll with just because he's strong and wiring athletic and freaking good and doesn't stop. Yeah.

834
01:25:24.56 --> 01:25:30.16
But I have like an unwritten rule with him no matter what 100%. If if either one of us wants to roll,

835
01:25:30.16 --> 01:25:34.96
we roll. Yeah. Doesn't matter what's going on. If one of us wants to roll, we roll. Yeah. And most of

836
01:25:34.96 --> 01:25:42.80
the time he wants to roll, I don't. And I roll them every time. Yeah. Yeah, that's how. And in that

837
01:25:42.80 --> 01:25:48.000
kind, I mean, let's face it that like you have mixed emotions about those kind of, because you see

838
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.68
him and you're like, because you have it in your head, like you can't not roll with that person.

839
01:25:51.68 --> 01:25:58.24
I have that with Noah, where if he's there, it's like, it's on. And he's like, I don't know if

840
01:25:58.24 --> 01:26:02.24
man, he's been kind of working me recently. Yeah. So I say, oh man, I see him. I'm like,

841
01:26:02.24 --> 01:26:06.24
I know this is going to be like a hard roll, but I can't not roll with him. Like that would

842
01:26:06.24 --> 01:26:10.56
defeat the whole purpose of my existence here right now. If like, don't roll with them, you know,

843
01:26:10.56 --> 01:26:15.44
roll with Noah for sure. And he's the same way. He's coming out you the whole time. He's freaking

844
01:26:15.44 --> 01:26:20.08
awesome at you, Jitsu. Yeah. He's in good shape. He's strong. He's got, he's just got it. He's

845
01:26:20.08 --> 01:26:24.88
just going to bring it. Yeah. He's got to be, he's like, that's the way it is. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So,

846
01:26:24.88 --> 01:26:31.12
Noah, Akbar, like these guys that it's like, okay, if they weren't here, it would be an

847
01:26:31.12 --> 01:26:37.04
easier day regardless. Well, I don't know. But not everyone's like that, you know. And actually

848
01:26:37.04 --> 01:26:40.80
there can be guys who are like, even actually better than you, but you roll with them in it's like,

849
01:26:40.80 --> 01:26:45.84
it's not this huge, like, it's not that like hard of a roll. You know, it's like there's just

850
01:26:45.84 --> 01:26:52.48
different things. Yeah. But the lie that we can tell ourselves even though you're the only one

851
01:26:52.48 --> 01:26:57.12
you're laying to everyone, every can see what you're doing. When you'd like do avoid that. Yeah.

852
01:26:57.12 --> 01:27:02.72
Now, there are situations that unfold, then this is one that I do. So let's say I have an injury.

853
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:10.32
Right. Legitimate injury. I will, let's say a normal day for me is like, okay, I'm going to do

854
01:27:10.32 --> 01:27:15.04
eight rounds. You know, eight, six minute rounds. Cool. That's normal. Like that's a good roll for me.

855
01:27:15.04 --> 01:27:20.000
I had a good time. You know, whatever takes an hour, whatever. He's a minute rast. Whatever.

856
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:28.96
So, so maybe not. But anyways, if I'm injured, sometimes I got to be like, okay, I can only

857
01:27:28.96 --> 01:27:35.68
do four rounds because then it's just odds that I'm going to re-enter some stupid. And I just,

858
01:27:35.68 --> 01:27:41.84
I'm like, hey, what I try to do is tell people beforehand. So that way, I'm not being that guy.

859
01:27:41.84 --> 01:27:47.76
Like, if you want to roll with me now, it's the time. Because in four rolls, maybe five.

860
01:27:48.80 --> 01:27:55.20
Sure. You know, then I'm going to call it. Yeah. So it does happen. And I guess the reason that I'm

861
01:27:55.20 --> 01:28:00.80
saying that is just to be like, well, I'm going to roll no matter what. If you're injured,

862
01:28:00.80 --> 01:28:06.88
and like you know the deal, like when you're injured, you can, you can get lucky for like three

863
01:28:06.88 --> 01:28:11.52
four rolls. And like, okay, I didn't tweak anything. We're good. It didn't get worse. That fourth

864
01:28:11.52 --> 01:28:17.12
fifth roll, now you're six roll, you're tired. You're giving up a little bit more and all of a sudden,

865
01:28:17.12 --> 01:28:24.96
that's when you get hurt. So just a little tail of caution. Yes, big time. And, you know,

866
01:28:24.96 --> 01:28:30.40
one, it's easy kind of like when we're just sitting here, you know, not in the situation. It's

867
01:28:30.40 --> 01:28:35.20
easy to be like, oh, yeah, you just, you just work around the injury. And if you got to get

868
01:28:35.20 --> 01:28:39.52
caught in a submission, a towel, you know, it's not a submission that you're going to get. That's easy.

869
01:28:39.52 --> 01:28:44.96
You hope that someone, if you've got a sore elbow, you hope that what hurts you is, oh, someone

870
01:28:44.96 --> 01:28:49.76
puts an arm walk and you go, oh, tap early. Right. That's what you hope it is. What you don't hope

871
01:28:49.76 --> 01:28:53.84
it is is you're rolling and turning and your arm gets caught in a bad spot. And now you re-indra.

872
01:28:53.84 --> 01:28:57.52
Yeah. There's no tapping from that. That's just another injury. Yeah. So the way I mean,

873
01:28:57.52 --> 01:29:02.000
what I had in my head was like, um, or, you know, your knee or whatever, whatever, whatever,

874
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.12
rib, whatever. And you're like, I'm just going to go like kind of little lighter, you know,

875
01:29:07.12 --> 01:29:13.36
right? Exactly. You roll one round and then you roll one round with like, no, or something,

876
01:29:13.36 --> 01:29:18.40
go light, no way, man. And it's, you can consciously be going, oh, yeah, I'm going to go light.

877
01:29:18.40 --> 01:29:22.48
But start rolling. Yeah, just see how much you can remember to go light when you're, you know,

878
01:29:22.48 --> 01:29:26.56
things can't compare to that. Whatever. Sure. You always say to me like, when you do a good

879
01:29:26.56 --> 01:29:31.44
move to me and you say, uh, yeah, you sense furgents. Yeah, you say, that's a big victory for you.

880
01:29:32.48 --> 01:29:37.04
You're my sense of urgency to increase and it's like the biggest W. Oh, yeah, because you're just so good.

881
01:29:37.04 --> 01:29:42.32
And you say it to me too. Well, I don't say that. It's a big W, but I do say I recognize

882
01:29:42.32 --> 01:29:49.92
what sense of urgency. You're all on TV. Anyway, when you're in the moment,

883
01:29:50.80 --> 01:29:56.32
whether you can control it fully or not or whatever, I would say you just decrease the chance of

884
01:29:56.32 --> 01:30:01.76
you staying safe as time goes on. Yes. You just, that's just like the numbers. Yeah,

885
01:30:01.76 --> 01:30:08.96
like just like odds odds odds are made it through four rounds. I'm okay. Right. I'm walking off the

886
01:30:08.96 --> 01:30:14.08
mat right now. Right. So that's like the opposite of a lie. You're like being so, so truthful with

887
01:30:14.08 --> 01:30:19.28
yourself. You're like, hey, you know, and you're, and you're doing the right thing. The lie comes

888
01:30:19.28 --> 01:30:24.56
when you're like, you're not injured. You're just maybe not feeling up to it. Maybe you're hung

889
01:30:24.56 --> 01:30:30.32
over. I don't know. Maybe that you put, you know, a person. And then you say, well, you know,

890
01:30:30.32 --> 01:30:35.44
I'm this or I'm sick or I'm this and you say that excuse whoever to yourself and then like

891
01:30:35.44 --> 01:30:43.04
you avoid the whole rules. Yeah, I had Wes. Like I was trained and I was deep into some rounds

892
01:30:43.60 --> 01:30:47.52
and Wes's and Wes was on the other mat and he comes over and Wes is a beast too. Like,

893
01:30:47.52 --> 01:30:52.40
I mean, he's just strong and strategic to. It's awesome. And every time it's going to be a gut check.

894
01:30:52.40 --> 01:30:58.16
And I'm like sit up against the wall. I'm done. And he's like, you want to get one? And I was like,

895
01:30:59.60 --> 01:31:06.24
and I said, no, you know, I was like, no. And then I was like, bro, and then like 30 seconds went by.

896
01:31:06.24 --> 01:31:10.24
And I was like, all right, bro. I'm sorry. That's just a week. Like, because I wasn't done yet.

897
01:31:10.88 --> 01:31:15.28
I knew I wasn't done. There's times where I've been like, hey, no, I can't roll. Like, I've got a,

898
01:31:15.28 --> 01:31:21.68
I'm, no, I'm done for the night. It's not smart for me to roll. I need to have discipline.

899
01:31:21.68 --> 01:31:25.28
The more than anything else, right? Because you know, when you're injured, you're there,

900
01:31:25.28 --> 01:31:31.84
it's like, you want to roll so bad. You feel like a caged animal. Just wanted to get on the

901
01:31:31.84 --> 01:31:37.04
mats of justice. Yeah, pretty much any time you're there and you're not ruling injured. It's the worst

902
01:31:37.04 --> 01:31:43.60
man working in my case, you know, filming whatever. Yeah. No, I mean, you can't. That's just how,

903
01:31:43.60 --> 01:31:50.48
but yeah. But again, that's like the opposite of the lie. Like your, your truth is, is very,

904
01:31:50.48 --> 01:32:01.44
how should I say strong? Like, you don't like the lie, like, hits you hard when you begin to lie to yourself.

905
01:32:01.44 --> 01:32:06.08
You know, but some people, they can just roll with it, but everyone sees what you're doing.

906
01:32:06.08 --> 01:32:10.72
Everybody, you know, or the guy who's tying his belt every 10 seconds, you know, like,

907
01:32:10.72 --> 01:32:15.84
you know, basically what you're doing. Yeah, you're trying to perpetuate somewhere. Yeah. But the mats,

908
01:32:15.84 --> 01:32:21.92
they don't lie. So that's why we think, GJJ is a positive thing. Sure, I think so.

909
01:32:23.12 --> 01:32:30.08
It does expose our truth or maintain our truth. It's a good act, one system to be in. I think so.

910
01:32:30.08 --> 01:32:37.12
You gotta be careful, like all ecosystems. But in that ecosystem, this is what we do care about.

911
01:32:37.84 --> 01:32:43.68
What can you be? Yeah. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. Come on, we all check it out, like,

912
01:32:43.68 --> 01:32:47.92
oh, like, put it this way. We don't want to be walking on with a second rate,

913
01:32:47.92 --> 01:32:55.28
G, that's made in wherever, not here. Yeah. Yes. No, we don't. What do you want your G to say? Look,

914
01:32:55.28 --> 01:33:04.16
I train GJJ too. I work hard. And I support this country and it's workers. Yes. That's what I want my

915
01:33:04.16 --> 01:33:09.36
G to say. Yeah. There's only one G that says that. Yeah. But there's only one G that says that. Yeah.

916
01:33:09.36 --> 01:33:13.92
And that's the origin G. And I think we all know that. You know, so yes, the question,

917
01:33:13.92 --> 01:33:21.76
what do you do I get? One, I do GJ to when I start GJ to when I compete in GJ to you get an origin G.

918
01:33:21.76 --> 01:33:28.64
Yes. You get an origin, Rashguard for the no-ghi scenarios set unfold. And then, since you can't

919
01:33:28.64 --> 01:33:36.56
wear a G and a Rashguard in public, unless you're John Donner, her, the exeases represent that Rash.

920
01:33:36.56 --> 01:33:41.76
Is he still represent the Rashguard super hardcore as far as I know, but no, he's definitely

921
01:33:41.76 --> 01:33:47.68
so legit. We need to send him some Rashcarts. Anyways, if you're not John Donner, and you're going

922
01:33:47.68 --> 01:33:53.36
to go out, you don't really want to wear G pants and a Rashguard, you can get other clothing

923
01:33:53.36 --> 01:34:03.44
from origin made such as T shirts, jeans, sweatshirts, hoodies, what are you going to say? I think

924
01:34:03.44 --> 01:34:08.40
sweatshirts and hoodies kind of covers it covers it. Okay, what are you going to say? You're going to

925
01:34:08.40 --> 01:34:18.08
say jeans? Yeah. G jeans. Delta 68. Delta 68 are those out. Yeah. Yeah. We're working on that.

926
01:34:18.08 --> 01:34:20.96
I can't. Hey, working on it. Hey, if you're working on it, you're working on it.

927
01:34:20.96 --> 01:34:25.68
All good. I actually told Pete, let's put it. And I don't like to do this, but let's do the pre order

928
01:34:25.68 --> 01:34:31.52
thing. So we can actually get the demand signal because people are demanding the Delta 68.

929
01:34:31.52 --> 01:34:37.76
Yes, yeah. Because I talked them up because they are truly the greatest things I've ever put

930
01:34:37.76 --> 01:34:46.16
on my legs. There you go. Also, joggers, those are not the greatest things I put on my legs. You know,

931
01:34:46.16 --> 01:34:51.20
but we're not really for me. Not a jogger's kind of guy. Because you don't, well, yeah. I mean,

932
01:34:51.20 --> 01:34:56.48
you know, fashionably speaking, yeah, that's not you. You know, that's kind of down there on your

933
01:34:56.48 --> 01:35:00.72
list of priorities. So I get it right now. Those are just two things that I'm not really super

934
01:35:00.72 --> 01:35:06.88
concerned. Although oddly enough, the comfort of the Delta 68 is one of the things that makes

935
01:35:06.88 --> 01:35:12.24
them is very epic. Yeah. It's just like the cherry on top. If you came to Jockel Live, I was

936
01:35:12.24 --> 01:35:18.56
wearing Delta 68. If you see me in public and I'm wearing jeans, they're Delta 68.

937
01:35:18.56 --> 01:35:26.08
Jogging. There you go. Originmain.com is where. Also, supplements. These are important supplements.

938
01:35:26.08 --> 01:35:33.04
Jolens. For your joints. Supplements for your joints. That's important. Try live. You can be the

939
01:35:33.04 --> 01:35:36.64
strongest guy in the world. You should show. There's not working. Let me ask you this. Is this jacked up?

940
01:35:36.64 --> 01:35:45.44
So a guy hit me up on social media and was like, hey, you're old. How do you, how do you

941
01:35:45.44 --> 01:35:50.56
maintain? Like, how do you do this? And you know, I, there's one of those things, what was I

942
01:35:50.56 --> 01:35:55.52
like? Well, do I just tell them like straight up, man? If you're not on joint warfare and acrylic oil,

943
01:35:56.24 --> 01:36:01.92
you're just wrong. Like, step number one, get on joint warfare and acrylic oil. Seriously. Super

944
01:36:01.92 --> 01:36:09.28
krill joint warfare. That's what you want to do. Now, the thing that I told them also is very

945
01:36:09.28 --> 01:36:15.76
consistent. Right. I'm not one of those guys that takes three weeks off from doing anything and

946
01:36:15.76 --> 01:36:24.000
then jumps back into the two squat. Like, no, I'm working out for all practical purposes. I'm

947
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:31.60
working out every single day. Now, is the occasions where life gets in the way? Sure. Yep. That's

948
01:36:31.60 --> 01:36:38.72
what it's called a day off. That's why I don't take voluntary days off. But I'm telling you, if you

949
01:36:38.72 --> 01:36:48.48
want to maintain like the activity at a high level and you're an older person, I mean, I'm only

950
01:36:48.48 --> 01:36:58.08
48. I feel like I'm 21 or 22, maybe. Let's say 27. How about that? Sure. But joint warfare and

951
01:36:58.08 --> 01:37:02.32
acrylic oil. Those are the supplements that you're specifically talking about right now. So,

952
01:37:03.52 --> 01:37:07.12
I can't recommend them strongly enough. And I should have just told that guy, listen, be consistent,

953
01:37:07.12 --> 01:37:11.92
work out, do a good job, warm up and take acrylic oil and joint warfare. But then you feel like,

954
01:37:11.92 --> 01:37:17.04
oh, I'm just, you know, you don't even sell them as good as stuff like, bro, this is it. So I actually

955
01:37:17.04 --> 01:37:22.000
did him a disservice. Yeah. Because that's true. When you go like every day in consistent, your body

956
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.40
started, you know, for lack of a better way of putting it in as far as details go. But you're

957
01:37:26.40 --> 01:37:30.72
by just used to it. But at the same time, yeah, you know, like your joints are taking a meeting.

958
01:37:30.72 --> 01:37:35.84
If you're pushing hard, which I am, which, yeah, I mean, why would I? I mean, I guess maybe there's

959
01:37:35.84 --> 01:37:41.04
under some circumstance that's okay. But if you're pushing hard, yeah, you're joint's going to be like,

960
01:37:41.68 --> 01:37:46.48
kind of taking some of the front. Yeah, for sure. You know, so yeah, if your joints can see in the

961
01:37:46.48 --> 01:37:50.96
game, but it's like, yeah, well, no, more important. If you're joints can't stay in the game,

962
01:37:50.96 --> 01:37:55.84
you're out of the game. Yes. That's the problem. Yeah, that's the, that's the, like, hey, you can be

963
01:37:55.84 --> 01:37:59.52
big and strong. And your joints don't work, it doesn't matter. You're, it's only strong as your

964
01:37:59.52 --> 01:38:06.32
weakest link. Make your weakest link. Your strongest link. Join Warfare and Krooel. Discipline,

965
01:38:07.92 --> 01:38:15.04
discipline, powder form, awesome. If you need a can of a tasty beverage, that's actually good for you.

966
01:38:16.64 --> 01:38:25.76
Get yourself some discipline. Go. RTD. Ready to deploy. Yes. Or drink with. Yeah, we prefer to play over here.

967
01:38:25.76 --> 01:38:32.40
I think. I understand. Also, milk protein in the form of a dessert. Additional protein. I

968
01:38:32.40 --> 01:38:37.44
don't know where you can stick. I get it. It's true. It's good. But you want the dessert with some

969
01:38:37.44 --> 01:38:43.76
additional protein. Some to increase and improve your protein synthesis. Yeah.

970
01:38:45.76 --> 01:38:50.32
Just got hit to that one. It's like when there's protein. Okay, so I was one of the guys who,

971
01:38:50.32 --> 01:38:56.40
who, who, one of the many of us, who, you know what, you don't want to animal like window is?

972
01:38:56.40 --> 01:39:00.08
Yeah, it's like after you work out, you got to certain amount of time. Yeah, you got to eat within. Yeah,

973
01:39:00.08 --> 01:39:03.44
you got to eat the protein and take cake in in because that's when your body like kind of wants

974
01:39:03.44 --> 01:39:08.08
to take it in. If you miss that window, it doesn't take as much in. So apparently,

975
01:39:09.04 --> 01:39:16.56
that's not as much of a thing. From what I'm, bro science has been this green in the 1940.

976
01:39:16.56 --> 01:39:22.32
Well, there's been controversy in the broscience world. No man, just a shift really.

977
01:39:22.32 --> 01:39:27.04
A shift paradigm. A paradigm shift. The broscience world. So interesting.

978
01:39:27.04 --> 01:39:31.84
So I come from someone that has a doctorate in broscience, echoed roles. You know, I'm

979
01:39:31.84 --> 01:39:36.56
at least staying on this. So what do you think is the point? We can drink milk anytime.

980
01:39:38.56 --> 01:39:43.12
There's another one we're really having. Milk at 9.48 at night when I'm like, you know what,

981
01:39:43.12 --> 01:39:49.20
I want to surf right now. Cool. I'm going to have some milk. Yeah. Yeah, basically. Yeah. So it's more

982
01:39:49.20 --> 01:39:54.24
about the protein rolling around in your system generally speaking. And you know, when your body

983
01:39:54.24 --> 01:39:58.96
needs protein to rebuild muscle, boom, you got some protein already in there. Whether you take it in

984
01:39:59.52 --> 01:40:04.48
20 minutes after you lift or if you know, you just sort of taking it in throughout the day.

985
01:40:05.92 --> 01:40:10.64
Same thing goes for your children. They can take in protein at any time. They can also take

986
01:40:10.64 --> 01:40:15.20
in poison sugar. But don't give them that, give them the protein to good stuff. War your kid

987
01:40:15.20 --> 01:40:21.52
milk. And then get yourself some jocquoise tea, by the way. Which is as echoed, Charles likes to

988
01:40:21.52 --> 01:40:28.56
point out organic. It is certified. Hi. I'm jocquoise, like organic certified tea salesman.

989
01:40:28.56 --> 01:40:35.36
Yep. Definitely. Who would have fought? Look, it's not about the organic. It's about having an

990
01:40:35.36 --> 01:40:42.56
8,000 pound deadlift, which is 100% guaranteed. Double pine. Double pine pussy. They're tested.

991
01:40:43.60 --> 01:40:50.000
Get some. And by the way, all these items are available right now at the vitamin shop.

992
01:40:50.56 --> 01:40:55.36
So you probably, hopefully, have a vitamin shop near you. You can just go down there and pick up

993
01:40:55.36 --> 01:41:02.16

999
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.32
Yeah. I mean, within reason. With it means I mean, and by that, I only mean like, I'm not signing

1000
01:41:39.52 --> 01:41:43.28
you know, body parts. But apart. Yeah. Well,

1001
01:41:44.72 --> 01:41:49.52
motorplac some four. Certainly. That's body parts. I'm not going to sign. Yeah. I think it's good.

1002
01:41:50.24 --> 01:41:57.52
So there you go. Skin or domain.com. Yes, or domain.com for all this stuff. Good stuff. By the way,

1003
01:41:57.52 --> 01:42:04.32

1004
01:42:04.32 --> 01:42:13.04
course stuff, the discipline equals freedom stuff. The good quote unquote good stuff. When I mean

1005
01:42:13.04 --> 01:42:18.80
stuff, that's T-shirts, hoodies, lightweight and heavy, rash guards, more rash guards,

1006
01:42:18.80 --> 01:42:25.52
representative of the path directly. While you're doing the jujitsu. I saw people on the

1007
01:42:25.52 --> 01:42:31.28
podium represent me. So I'm a three-cently. Oh yeah, on that one, yeah, we had a represent on that one.

1008
01:42:31.28 --> 01:42:39.28
Appreciate everyone that represents the path. Big time. Every podcast and the deaf core.

1009
01:42:41.28 --> 01:42:46.48
So yeah, competition. But yeah, a hat's on there as well. And cool stuff on there. We

1010
01:42:46.48 --> 01:42:53.60
like something. Get something. Represent when you're on the path. Jocos store.com. Also,

1011
01:42:53.60 --> 01:42:58.88
subscribe to the podcast. If you haven't already, we're, we don't know if that's important.

1012
01:42:58.88 --> 01:43:04.56
Is it important? It's important. It's not not important. Overall, we're saying yes, it's important.

1013
01:43:04.56 --> 01:43:10.000
So do it. Subscribe. Subscribe. If you want. So good. It's beneficial. If you're listening,

1014
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.84

1015
01:43:15.84 --> 01:43:20.88
the grounded podcast. Yes. Where we talk about life jujitsu. We're looking like we're probably going

1016
01:43:20.88 --> 01:43:28.24
to make some more of those in the very near future. War your kid podcast. That is the best podcast

1017
01:43:28.24 --> 01:43:36.72
that a child could listen to. Am I biased? Maybe. Am I right? Absolutely. And don't forget about

1018
01:43:36.72 --> 01:43:47.12
war your kid soap. And I am overjoyed doing for me that we have a new soap out from IrishOach Ranch.com.

1019
01:43:47.12 --> 01:43:53.52
It's got anti bacterial anti microbial. Right.

1020
01:43:53.52 --> 01:44:01.52
Colonial. Well, anyways, it's got really good stuff. If you're dirty, especially dirty

1021
01:44:01.52 --> 01:44:07.60
in the tents of jujitsu, where you've got little creepy crawlies trying to get into your skin,

1022
01:44:08.56 --> 01:44:14.16
then you can get something that we made young and it's called killer soap.

1023
01:44:14.16 --> 01:44:20.24
Good IrishOach Ranch.com. So you can get yourself some killer soap and

1024
01:44:22.24 --> 01:44:27.76
stay clean. Stay clean. Of course. Also YouTube channel. We have YouTube channel for the video

1025
01:44:27.76 --> 01:44:33.20
version of this podcast and some excerpts on there. You'll share these excerpts. Go ahead. Do it.

1026
01:44:33.20 --> 01:44:38.64
If you're boss needs to hear this. Don't do it like that. I'm just saying if you sort of just

1027
01:44:38.64 --> 01:44:44.72
anyway, good stuff on there. I think enhanced stuff as well. You can see,

1028
01:44:45.84 --> 01:44:52.64
jocko and his things are exploding. Things are catching on fire. Sometimes things are cracking open.

1029
01:44:55.04 --> 01:45:02.88
Synchronization with my words. Yeah. And music. Chelos and whatnot. Yes. The last haven't

1030
01:45:02.88 --> 01:45:11.04
heard echoes and enhanced videos. You may not know it. Echo is a chelo enthusiast. I, well,

1031
01:45:11.68 --> 01:45:15.20
chelos, I replaced me one of his videos when the chelos kicks it. I didn't look.

1032
01:45:17.20 --> 01:45:22.24
Anyway, videos on there. Yes. So you've got YouTube channel. Yeah. What's it called?

1033
01:45:22.24 --> 01:45:26.16
Jocco podcast. Jocco podcast. What's it called? The thorn. We also have something called

1034
01:45:26.16 --> 01:45:34.16
Psychological Warfare. And I got a great piece of information, a great suggestion from someone

1035
01:45:35.36 --> 01:45:39.12
some trooper out there just made a great suggestion. This suggestion was when you talk about

1036
01:45:39.12 --> 01:45:46.08
psychological warfare, you should describe it as a little psychological eater.

1037
01:45:48.64 --> 01:45:53.52
Well, as soon as I said it, I was like, you get credit. Credit. So yes, if you need a little

1038
01:45:53.52 --> 01:45:58.96
psychological eater to help you get over some moment of weakness, we'll guess what we got

1039
01:45:58.96 --> 01:46:04.32
something for you. It's called Psychological Warfare. It's on iTunes, Google Play, other MP3 platforms.

1040
01:46:04.32 --> 01:46:11.76
If you need a visual, hitter, then go to flipsidecampus.com where the code of my

1041
01:46:11.76 --> 01:46:19.04
or speaking of is making visual representations of the path that you can hang on your wall on your

1042
01:46:19.04 --> 01:46:25.60
ceiling in your doorway. Keep you on the path. That's what you need to do. Got some books,

1043
01:46:26.64 --> 01:46:34.08
leadership strategy and tactics. The most recent, the answer to the answer to every leadership

1044
01:46:34.08 --> 01:46:38.24
question that I've been asked on this podcast, that I get asked all the time. So leadership

1045
01:46:38.24 --> 01:46:43.36
strategy and tactics field manual, everyone that got it, thank you, made it number one on a

1046
01:46:43.36 --> 01:46:48.88
bunch of different lists, which was awesome. And I was super stoked. It was especially awesome.

1047
01:46:48.88 --> 01:46:54.56
If you're in the literary ecosystem, then you go, oh, number one, everyone else doesn't care.

1048
01:46:54.56 --> 01:46:59.04
So I'm kind of got one foot in that door because there's a bunch of people that I work with that

1049
01:46:59.92 --> 01:47:04.40
in the literary world because that's what that's what it is, right? You write a book. You're in the

1050
01:47:04.40 --> 01:47:09.12
literary world. Yes. So that ecosystem. So you guys even though none of you care,

1051
01:47:10.56 --> 01:47:16.72
you all propelled me to the number one in that ecosystem that anyone that's outside of the

1052
01:47:16.72 --> 01:47:24.000
literary world doesn't care about. People say, how do you stay humble? Guess what? No one cares

1053
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:29.68
about this stuff. That's how leadership strategy and tactics got a bunch of kids books,

1054
01:47:29.68 --> 01:47:33.84
way the warrior kid, one, two and three, Mikey and the dragons for that little or kid,

1055
01:47:33.84 --> 01:47:40.000
discipline equals freedom, field manual, which people just take pictures of that and just post,

1056
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:46.16
just a picture of the cover of the book, which I'm always like credit. So leadership strategy

1057
01:47:46.16 --> 01:47:50.96
and tactics is field manual, too. The first field manual was just pointy because freedom, field manual.

1058
01:47:50.96 --> 01:47:56.24
The audio version of that is on iTunes Amazon music, Google Play and other MP3 platforms. And then

1059
01:47:56.24 --> 01:48:01.20
of course, it all started with extreme ownership and the dichotomy leadership, which I wrote with

1060
01:48:01.20 --> 01:48:05.84
my brother, Lave Babin, about the lessons that we learned in combat and how you can use them in

1061
01:48:05.84 --> 01:48:16.40
business and life. We got EF online, which is leadership training online and what this is is

1062
01:48:17.52 --> 01:48:22.32
a supplement. Actually, it doesn't even have to be a supplement. It could be the whole meal.

1063
01:48:22.32 --> 01:48:27.44
If this is what you can do, then you want leadership training, go to EF online. If you need it

1064
01:48:27.44 --> 01:48:33.20
inside your company, inside your business, inside your team, you can contact echelon front.com.

1065
01:48:33.20 --> 01:48:39.52
That's my leadership consultancy echelon front.com. What we do is solve problems through

1066
01:48:39.52 --> 01:48:47.84
leadership. We got some musters coming up up. We got, well, all the ones that we've done

1067
01:48:47.84 --> 01:48:58.16
I'm sold out. The ones that are coming up on deck are Orlando, Florida, Dallas, Texas,

1068
01:48:58.16 --> 01:49:05.44
Phoenix Arizona and Phoenix Arizona. Go to extreme ownership.com for those, all the events that

1069
01:49:05.44 --> 01:49:11.12
we've ever done have sold out. So if you want to come, go to extreme ownership.com early so that you can

1070
01:49:11.12 --> 01:49:18.48
get some. And last thing we now have EF Overwatch and EF Legion. EF Overwatch aimed at

1071
01:49:18.48 --> 01:49:24.80
executive leadership taking folks that were in the military leaders, senior leaders in the military

1072
01:49:24.80 --> 01:49:31.52
and placing them into civilian companies so that they can help that company move forward.

1073
01:49:32.48 --> 01:49:39.52
That's our executive leadership placement firm. We also have EF Legion, which is front-line

1074
01:49:39.52 --> 01:49:45.12
troops and front-line leaders. So if you've been in the military, if you're a veteran and you want

1075
01:49:45.12 --> 01:49:49.36
to find your next mission, if you're a senior leader, cool, go to EF Overwatch. If you're a junior

1076
01:49:49.36 --> 01:49:55.84
leader, go to EF Legion and companies that are looking for junior leaders or executive leaders,

1077
01:49:55.84 --> 01:50:01.76
you can do the same thing. EF Legion.com or EF Overwatch.com, these are people that understand

1078
01:50:01.76 --> 01:50:09.44
the principles that we teach and kind of apply them inside your business. And if you have not heard

1079
01:50:09.44 --> 01:50:21.36
enough of my exceedingly slow talking and ludicrously serious tone, and you haven't had enough

1080
01:50:21.36 --> 01:50:29.84
of Echos marginally applicable metaphors. If you can't get enough of those two things,

1081
01:50:29.84 --> 01:50:36.72
we'll guess what, you can get more. We are available on the inner webs on Twitter, Instagram,

1082
01:50:36.72 --> 01:50:48.96
and on that Facebook. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and to final word here.

1083
01:50:48.96 --> 01:50:53.36
Thank you all for listening to podcast. A podcast that exists thanks to your

1084
01:50:53.36 --> 01:50:57.84
support. Thanks for listening, spreading the word, telling your friends,

1085
01:50:57.84 --> 01:51:02.64
thanks for getting some deaf core or some origin gear, all of which support this podcast. And of

1086
01:51:02.64 --> 01:51:07.20
course, thanks to all the service members out there in uniform who protect the very freedoms that

1087
01:51:07.20 --> 01:51:13.68
make this podcast possible. Also to our police and law enforcement firefighters,

1088
01:51:13.68 --> 01:51:19.28
paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, board of patrol, secret service,

1089
01:51:19.28 --> 01:51:25.76
all the first responders. And I saw a bunch of military members. I saw a bunch of first responders

1090
01:51:25.76 --> 01:51:30.72
at all the Jocca lives and I appreciate you coming out. And I want to say thank you for providing

1091
01:51:30.72 --> 01:51:40.24
an environment where we can live our lives as we see fit. And to everyone else out there,

1092
01:51:43.20 --> 01:51:52.72
remember to tell yourself the truth. Remember to tell yourself the truth. You know what that means.

1093
01:51:52.72 --> 01:52:04.24
The truth is you need to do more. The truth is you need to be more to reach your fullest

1094
01:52:04.24 --> 01:52:13.04
maximum capacity and capability as a human being. And if you tell yourself that truth,

1095
01:52:13.04 --> 01:52:23.12
you will find discipline. And if you find discipline, you will find freedom.

1096
01:52:26.24 --> 01:52:36.08
So do not lie to yourself. And instead get out there and get after it.

1097
01:52:36.08 --> 01:52:42.40
And until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
