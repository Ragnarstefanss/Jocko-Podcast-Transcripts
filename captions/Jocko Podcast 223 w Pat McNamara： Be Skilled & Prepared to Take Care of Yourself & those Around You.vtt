1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jocoponcast number 223, Bideco Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, Jocco. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Modern combat is chaotic intense and shockingly destructive. In your first battle, you will experience the confusing and often terrifying sights, sounds, smells, and dangers of the battlefield.

3
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But you must learn to survive and win despite them.

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
One, you could face a fierce and relentless enemy.

5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Two, you could be surrounded by destruction and death.

6
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Three, your leaders and fellow soldiers may shout urgent commands and warnings.

7
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Four, rounds might impact near you.

8
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Five, the air could be filled with the smell of explosives and propellant.

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Six, you might hear the screams of a wounded comrade.

10
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
However, even in all this confusion and fear, remember that you are not alone.

11
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You are part of a well-trained team backed by the most powerful, combined arms force and the most modern technology in the world.

12
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You must keep faith with your fellow soldiers, remember your training and do your duty to the best of your ability.

13
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If you do and you uphold your warrior ethos, you can win and return home with honor.

14
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is the soldiers' field manual. It tells the soldier how to perform the combat skills needed to survive on the battlefield.

15
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
All soldiers across branches and components must learn these basic skills.

16
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Non-commissioned officers must ensure that their soldiers receive training on and know these vital combat skills.

17
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So, that right there is the opening introduction of the U.S. Army Field Manual 3.

18
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The U.S. Army Field Manual 3.

19
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
How to work in the desert in the jungle in Arctic conditions, how to use cover concealment and camouflage, how to prepare fighting positions.

20
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Fighting positions in urban environments, fighting positions in rural environments, immediate actions, fire and movement, fire movement on foot and fire movement in vehicles.

21
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:37.000
How to move effectively through open areas, how to get past windows, how to maneuver around corners, how to enter a building, clear a room, how to conduct reconnaissance missions, how to shoot a variety of weapons, and not just shoot them, but how do you battle zero those weapons, how do you use reflexive fire, what are your immediate actions on failure of your weapon systems.

22
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And of course there's communications. You've got to learn a bunch of different radios and radio voice procedures and then on top of that you got.

23
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000
You got the classic survival evasion resistance escape in the event that you get captured.

24
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
What about chemical biological and radiological weapons?

25
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:13.000
How do you face those? How do you what are the decontamination and treatment procedures for all those? What about minds? What about demolitions? What about breaching procedures?

26
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
What about IEDs? How do you identify them? How do you find them? How do you disarm or destroy them?

27
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Those are some of the things you need to learn and on top of all that. What about your army values? What about the law of land warfare? The code of conduct? The soldiers Creed and the warrior ethos.

28
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This manual is packed and that is a lot to learn. It's a lot to track and quite frankly what that manual covers is the basics. The fundamentals that's like the starting point because there are countless skills beyond those fundamentals.

29
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The longer that a soldier stays on task, the longer he stays operational, the more proficient he becomes at those fundamental skills and then moves on to advanced skills that have tighter standards and more detail and more modalities.

30
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:33.000
One thing about being a soldier is you never master it. There's too much. There's too many things to understand, too many things to practice, too many things to rehearse, too many things to exercise, too many things to execute.

31
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:54.000
To be truly good at these and I'll tell you what, these skills are not only applicable to soldiers. They're all applicable to life. They're all useful in life.

32
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And maybe it's because there's so much. Sometimes people sometimes soldiers sometimes service men and women, they let those skills slide as time goes on. They become softer, they weaken.

33
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But there are some soldiers and some people that continue to strive. They continue to push that continue to try become faster and stronger and more skilled and more accurate and more lethal.

34
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And they never stop aspiring to be their best and those are the true centenals of freedom, who not only strive to be their best but also pass on their knowledge to others.

35
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And that's what they do with their lives. And it's an honor to have one of those centenals with us here tonight, retired special forces, soldier, tactical shooting instructor, and all around highly skilled and capable combat veteran, Pat McNamara.

36
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate the opportunity. Yeah, man. Thanks for coming on. It's I know we linked up.

37
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I forget how you sent me a message. I sent you a message or something. And we'll, but you finally were able to come out here and you know you said, hey, you're going to be around them. Like I can make it happen.

38
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:54.000
You know, the beauty of the inner webs, right? I mean some really great people. I mean outstanding people with great character and all positive attributes.

39
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So, and when I made them like you, for example, all I knew through the inner webs never we never met in person.

40
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But you could say from through the bullshit and tell whether or not somebody's legit and whether they're, you know, whether they're honorable person, whether they got good work ethic and all that shit. So the people I meet, I'm very fortunate to have met some great people because of the inner webs and you're one of them. So thank you so much for making this happen.

41
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So we and I got some things in common. One of us, we both got in the military pretty quick. We also both grew up in New England. Yeah. So let's go. Let's go right to the beginning. Where this started.

42
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:51.000
You grew up in Connecticut. Yep. And what did will you have to support where you're an athlete? You know what? I started out like my early like twins years kind of.

43
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I was an odd kid. I was an odd ball. You know, I was probably, I was probably my dad was probably disappointed, but he supported all my odd ball shit that I wanted to do.

44
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I mean, I had all the scissi hobbies. I was not an athlete. I was, I was a, I was the kid who got picked on.

45
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Yeah, I mean, I would write you a second. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
There was a reason for it. It was a time when I went through a metamorphosis and I had, it was like a signature swim type of thing.

47
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But you know, I would, I write you in a cycle to school. I drew. I watched birds. I picked flowers. All that stuff.

48
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And yeah, I was, I was a big time scissi. And then I had a, I had a window of opportunity to get tough.

49
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And I had some mentors in my neighborhood who pointing me down a road.

50
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And the window of opportunity was it was basically a like survival because I had old brother who tormented me. I mean, he was horrible person.

51
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And when he went to prison the first time, I was right at like 15 years old.

52
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So, you know, as a teenager, you know, you're growing. You have the capacity to really grow and be somebody.

53
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And I had neighbors and said, hey, man, what are you going to do with this time? You have this time. And I didn't even think of it as that had no idea what they were talking about.

54
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:31.000
You know, you have this time to, to prepare for his, you know, for him to come back home. You have time.

55
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So, yeah, I started wrestling. That was a big thing.

56
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I was wrestling turned me around. And my first two years I sucked, about my second two years. I was, I was bad ass.

57
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I've seen you. I could not be beaten because I fell in love with it. And I would go to the college during the summers and practice with the college students.

58
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I kind of think, and I was lifting weights and, you know, running back and forth to work and stuff like that.

59
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So, I was able to, like, self-govern. I didn't need anybody to drive me because I saw the results. I saw it was happening. I saw the change.

60
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Got a couple of street fights. So, that, you know, you learn.

61
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:21.000
You learn whether or not you could cut the mustard in the neighborhood based on, you know, who's, who's picking a fight with you and how, and what the results are.

62
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Whether you're getting your ass beat with humility or your kicking somebody's ass. Either way, you know, you're learning a lot about yourself.

63
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
What you're doing with street fights? Double leg slam. Yeah. Exactly. Double leg take down.

64
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
You know, to a dump to a headlock, to a couple punches in the face. Yeah. Exactly.

65
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Those were the, you know, they talk about like the good old days. You, you know, the good old days.

66
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
We didn't use guns and knives. Whatever. Hey, in the good old days, it was just double leg headlock.

67
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
That's right. Double leg.

68
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
That was out. That's what a street fight was. There wasn't any of this.

69
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Judges to or Mointite. No. Double leg headlock. Yeah. Punch us to the face.

70
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:16.000
But I tell you, you had a real vanish. If you knew of little bit of fight, you know, back then because, you know, back then, I think fight training was, you know, take Juan do or just stuff like that.

71
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:26.000
You know, it was karate. Yeah. There was no like Mointite and Juditsu and stuff. So if you were wrestling, you had a big advantage on the street.

72
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Yeah. There was a guy when I was a new guy at Cilty 1. There was like a guy that had the reputation of being a fighter because he was some kind of some kind of karate guy or something like that.

73
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And this is, this is the 90s, right? This isn't that long ago.

74
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:54.000
But it's before UFC won. So people kind of fought well, you know, if you're the karate man, I don't, you know, that guy, I mean, you know, and there was a little interplatoon scrap between the karate kid.

75
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And a kid that was a wrestler and a good wrestler, like a state champ wrestler.

76
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Yeah.

77
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And he, you know, is exactly what happened in the fight. The karate kid got in his karate stance and the wrestler did a double leg slam headlock punch.

78
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Right. And everyone's like, dang. And what's crazy is now that I'm thinking about it. Even back then, it was kind of like, well, that must have just been, you know, a fluke.

79
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000
That the that the karate kid didn't do whatever a dimmuck in the kill him all the spots.

80
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So so, so wrestling was huge, huge for you. Yeah, big. Yeah, massive. So that really, that changed, that changed me in every, every way, you know, both physically and mentally.

81
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It just, and it's so funny because I talk a lot a lot. I talk about a lot with different special up guys.

82
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And one of the big common denominators is most of them were wrestlers in high school, you know, or are a really big percentage of more wrestlers in high school.

83
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Because I think it, that's the one sport where even though you're on a team, you know, you're not relying on a team or you're representing a team and your earning points toward for your team.

84
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And you have to be a team player, but you have to be self-driven too, you know, you have, if you want to be the best, you have to think, well, I need to do a thousand reps of this thing.

85
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I need to get my grip strength better. I need better balance. I need to do more sprints. I need, you know, to increase my shoulder strength, whatever it is. You know, you have to, you have to be very introspective, unlike, you know, because I played other sports.

86
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And there's some, there's some common ground with them too, but, but with the wrestling, you know, your monochemmono with another dude for that six minutes in time and that's a long freaking six minutes of the go six minutes.

87
00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I'm really shit. You know what else is, and there's another big thing, a big psychological thing. And my son just just wrapped up his season and, you know what?

88
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:21.000
The season didn't end, how he wanted it to end. Yeah. And his coach, who's a great guy, came up to me, you know, and he, you know, just standing there, you know, I was bummed out, but I'm not like super emotional about the thing, but his coach comes up and says,

89
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I said, yeah, it's a bad day and he goes, yeah, it's a bad day to have a bad day and I said, yeah, and he goes wrestling very rarely ends the way you want it to. Yeah. And if you think about that, you know, you go into a 64 man bracket. There's one person that that day ends the way they wanted it to or two day does.

90
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And then guess what, that person's going to the next tournament. Right. And what are the chances that it's really.

91
00:15:44.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And when you get done with the season, if you're the champion for the season, guess what? That means you've got another season coming up and eventually eventually you're not going to be happy with the outcome. Right. That's what's going to happen. So what's what I love about it is, you know, especially like you're saying your freshman sophomore year, you're just getting beat down.

92
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Yeah. And so many kids I see in the wrestling program, they that first year, you know, if they're getting beat down because they've never us before, they can't take it. Yeah, they're quitting and quit, but people that are tough.

93
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And they look at themselves and say, well, I least see how I can get myself better. How to work out when your brother got home.

94
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It turned out really, really well.

95
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
He, I was upstairs at the top of the stairwell, and I was in the bathroom. I was taking a dump.

96
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Was he in Juvee or was he in Juvee or was he in Juvee or was he in the, he was in the, he was state. He went to the, he went to the Penn state Penn.

97
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I'll think about the name because you'll remember it. You'll know the name of the town and everything. It'll hit me.

98
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
But he came upstairs and basically kicked the bathroom door open and I'm sitting down. I'm sitting down taking that.

99
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I'm sitting down taking that. I'm sitting down taking that.

100
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Yep. Yep. And I'm intimidated and I'm, and I'm now I'm embarrassed too because I got my pants right on my ankles. And I said, hey, get, you know, get that a lot here and he turns me. I could tell he's stone dotter to his mind.

101
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And he's got his fist in my face. You know what, those say I won't say I won't.

102
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And I pull my pants up and I said, you won't. And I freaking just straight right, just straight overhand right bam in a wet almost through his face and he went down the stairs.

103
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And then what did I do? I followed him downstairs. He got up double leg take down headlock and punch him.

104
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And my parents were sitting in the kitchen and they crossed their legs and just watched it happen.

105
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
They were like, it's about time this guy gets it. This is up and comments right here. You know, this is karma.

106
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000
They didn't do a thing. So I got, you know, those bricks in and I told them goodbye and looking at the door because I was going out.

107
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
You're seeing your year. That was my junior year. Yep.

108
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And what point did you start looking at the at the military?

109
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:12.000
That year. Yep. I knew I, so yeah junior year, 1617 is when I knew I had to, I had to do that.

110
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I had no idea what anything was with the military. So it's funny because when I went to the recruiters,

111
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I didn't tell my dad and I went to all the recruiters. I had no preference.

112
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I had no preference. It wasn't like I had allegiance because you know, somebody's dad was in the Marine Corps forever or

113
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Or war of the Army colors or anything like that. I didn't care. I just wanted, I wanted to be a tough guy.

114
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:46.000
So I went to each one of the recruiters and the vetting process was who could fast track me? Who could put me on a road to bad assory?

115
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.000
The fastest. I wanted a fast track to bad assory. So at the time the Army had the best answer because they had two programs.

116
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000
They had Rangers and then they had the SF Baby program 18X Ray.

117
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000
So I signed up for that and I went home until my dad and my dad was like, he was a little put off because I didn't tell him.

118
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:18.000
He said, hey, we're going back there, but I'm bringing my lawyer because I don't want this guy to fuck you. And sure, shit man, when I went back with the lawyer,

119
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
He was doing some scramble and with the paperwork. He was changing some numbers or digits around or whatever.

120
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I'm so glad that my dad hooked me up like that, you know, because it could have gone really bad.

121
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I mean, I mostly did. I mean, it's so funny. It's so funny because I look at that career and you have to be so lucky with us.

122
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And I tell all these guys who contact me on the interwebs and stuff.

123
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
They say, hey, I want to be a CEO, I want to be a force recount all this stuff.

124
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And it's hard to explain to them the amount not only how how tenacious you have to be, but the amount of luck involved in that.

125
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I say, guys, this is it's a good road to take. It's a bumpy road. There's no shortcuts.

126
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
But it's a well, it's a road we're taking.

127
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:18.000
But damn, man, I mean, because the amount of times I failed throughout my 22 year career, I could write a book just on failures.

128
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:26.000
You know, on the amount of shit that I failed and had to go back and do again, the injuries and the recoveries and the surgeries and another failure,

129
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:34.000
another failure, another failure, another failure. And I mean, and it's easy. It's pretty easy to go.

130
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Well, I failed that one. So I'm probably just not cut out for that thing.

131
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:49.000
But with most special ops guys, they don't stop at one thing. They don't like, for instance, become airborne ranger and say, well, this is a, this is a pentacle.

132
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:59.000
This is pentacle. I'm peeking out here. I'm going to just accept this. I mean, it's a great career path, but most of them say, what's the next step?

133
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:08.000
You know, what's the next step? Let me go and see if I could, you know, go to Hale School. Let me go to combat dive school. Let me go to SF Course.

134
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Let me try out for selection and go to the uni. You know, for most of them, they want to keep progressing and progressing.

135
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:27.000
So the opportunity in the, and the, not the opportunity, but the chance, the chances of failure become greater and greater because, you know, you're volunteering over and over and over.

136
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:41.000
So whenever I talk to young kids and they want to be, you know, they have it, they have it in their mind. I want to be a seal. I'm like, that's great, but just understand, you know, I'm all about it.

137
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And, and, and, and, you know, if you've got a good, if you've got a good, but it's the hard part is for me is to tell them there's a lot of luck involved.

138
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Yeah. I thought you were going to say there's no shortcuts and there's no guarantee.

139
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
That's, that's it, too. There's, yeah, just like that road. There's no shortcuts on that road. Yeah.

140
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Yep. That's why one thing that I, I, I, I pretty much, I, one thing I try not to do is say, yep, you should do it.

141
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Yeah. Because, and the worst thing about the Navy and going for the seal teams is, look, if that's what the kind of lifestyle you want to live, do you want to carry a machine gun? That's great, right?

142
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
If you don't make it in the seal teams, then you're not carrying a machine gun, right?

143
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000
At all. Right. Hey, if you don't make it through SF or you don't make it as a Ranger, you don't make it to force Recon, you can still be a grunt when you're awesome.

144
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Right. And that's what you want to do. I want to be a grunt since I was born. Yep.

145
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000
So, so when I joined the Navy, I, I never thought about that. I didn't even recognize that. I was too dumb.

146
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000
But it's, it's no guarantee. There's no shortcut and the man, yeah, it takes luck. You, you land wrong on a jump.

147
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:57.000
You, you know, get hurt for in, in the, in the basic seal training. There's something called rock shortage where there's big waves, your land in boats in these giant rocky area.

148
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And it's, it's, it's, it's too easy. Just to step off rock wave hits your knees blown out.

149
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Yeah. Two years of recovery, you put on weight, your fat, your outer shape, you know, you go back, you get stress fractures, you're done.

150
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
I, that happens all the time. Yeah. It happens all the time.

151
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I was, I was a toad jumper. My second job. I was 18 years old.

152
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
18 years old. That's a freaking toad jumper. I got toad all the way across the front of Drunkstone.

153
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000
I buy, stepping into my forearm, broke my ribs, dislocated shoulder concussion. I mean, I was jacked up and I just joined.

154
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
That was my first failure. That was number one.

155
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
That, that set me back, bro. Yeah.

156
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
That, and then that airplane again. Who?

157
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Was, what number jump was that for you? Number two.

158
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Oh, so I, I still had three left and three or four whatever it is in jump school.

159
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
So, toe jumper is, that's, that's just a nightmare.

160
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Yeah. And they brief it all the time. I never seen one.

161
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Yeah. Um, they brief it all the time. So, talk us through, talk us through being a toe jumper.

162
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Well, for, I mean, for people who don't know, you know, when you start out a jump career, that's how you start with a, with static line.

163
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
So, the static line is hooked to an inboard cable inside the aircraft and when you jump out of the airplane,

164
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:25.000
you hit the, the, uh, the end of the static line and it deploys your shoot. It pulls the shoot out and subsequently, you know, the shoot in

165
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Flades and you float to the ground straight down. It's around shoot. There's not a lot of skill involved.

166
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Yeah. And the key part is that that one static line pulls the shoot out.

167
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
It lets go. Right.

168
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
That's, they're not connected. Right. So it just pulls the shoot out. The shoot is now inflated and the static line stays with the aircraft.

169
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
That's, that's the aircraft. Yep.

170
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
So, and there's a different way to, right. That's what's supposed to happen. There's a lot of different ways you could become a toe jumper.

171
00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:01.000
One is, it's a, it's a fault of the rigor. So the rigor did something and there's a not somewhere within the, um, uh, you know,

172
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
the lines of the canopy or what have you.

173
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
So those are pretty rare.

174
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Um, another, the more common one is a fault of the jumper. You know, so the jumper does something wrong.

175
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
You know, he, he, he doesn't hand it to the, to the, to the safety the right way.

176
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000
His static line because as you, as you're going down, you know, the aircraft toward the door,

177
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
you got the static line your hand and the last step before you exit is to hand it to the safety of the jump master.

178
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:44.000
And he collects it up and he, you know, pushes him away from the jumper. So it's, uh, it's, it's, it's all very well rehearsed and it's choreographed.

179
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:59.000
And if there's a lot of theater too, it looks cool. Um, so I must have just like chucked it at him and it got away from him and it went, like under my reserve and around my arm.

180
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
So I'm not even halfway. I'm at the beginning of the stick. Uh, double door C 130.

181
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
I'm at the beginning of the stick. I go out and instant fire through my whole body instant.

182
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I go, I hit the end of the static line and I feel my whole body just jerk and go with the aircraft.

183
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I was lucky that the static line was under my reserve and not just around the arm.

184
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Because that would, you know, my arm would just come off. Bro, you know, but, uh, so it's under the reserve around the arm.

185
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
So there was some friction there with the static line around the equipment.

186
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Uh, the rest of it was around my arm. And I remember I had the whereabouts to look up the length of the static line.

187
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
And I could see jumpers coming over the top of me.

188
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000
But this wasn't, now don't get me wrong. This was not me beat. I was scared shitless. You know, I was looking up going, oh my god.

189
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000
You know, this, this is, I was horrified. It was, you know, a moment of horn.

190
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Um, and over, over, over, I could see jumpers jumping over me and I'm going, what in the hell?

191
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
You know, the training said, you know, put your hands on your reserve and wait to get pulled in and all this stuff and, um,

192
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
and I'm not remembering it because I can't do this. I can't put my hands on.

193
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Because your arm is too jacked. Arms up. Yeah.

194
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Oh, he's your arms like tangled in the static line. Yep. Oh. Yep.

195
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Now, and the most of the tensions around the reserve.

196
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Uh, but some, and I keep hitting the airplane. So thankfully, I hit it.

197
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Just so everyone knows, because you're in 130, 140 mile an hour wind. Yep.

198
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
That's what's, that's what's tossing you are. So I'm getting slammed up against the aircraft.

199
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
And, um, thankfully, I get slammed hard enough and it comes loose.

200
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
So I, you know, fall into the static line boom, shoot the place. Had, had that not happened.

201
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
There's no way I would have had to wear about the puller. My reserve. No freaking way.

202
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Because I was already, you know, shocky. You know, the body is amazing.

203
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
You know, when you reach, you know, pain level 10, the body would compensate.

204
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
You know, and says, let's take care of you and put you into some shock here.

205
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
So, you know, so you don't feel that bad. But I remember being very, very uncomfortable under canopy.

206
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
And I was groaning and moaning just, you know, just moaning and groaning.

207
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
And I was all the way at the end of the friaren. I was supposed to be like, way up at the leading edge.

208
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I was all the way at the end. I mean, right like at the wood line.

209
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Uh, and I hit the ground and I land on that side.

210
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Boom! Right on those ribs and all that soft shit. Right on that arm.

211
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Now to add insult to injury. I'm laying there and I'm going, you know, I'm just an 18 year punky kid bro.

212
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
You know, I've done nothing but basic training at AIT.

213
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
To add insult to injury. I'm laying there on the ground and a breeze comes in.

214
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Woo! My shoulder plates. My shoulder plates and it starts dragging it across fire drop.

215
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
So, and I'm getting drug. And I can hear, you know, the black hat.

216
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
So, the instructors out there would sit with stand on these platforms with bull horn.

217
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
And they were, you know, placed throughout this massive, what's friaren drops in.

218
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
I'm like, a two minute drop sooner or something.

219
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And gigantic. It's massive.

220
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And I could hear one of these black hat instructors.

221
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Y'all know me. Get up, leg. You over there. Get in drug.

222
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
At least one of you can't be released.

223
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Can't be released. The assembly is now leg.

224
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
And I'm going, oh my god. I better do what he says.

225
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Because I'm going to get in trouble.

226
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
So I do that. I reach up and pop.

227
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Pop one of my cable loop type can if you release assemblies.

228
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
And I'm scared. I'm scared. Because I think I'm going to get in trouble.

229
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
You know, because I'm hurt and I didn't get permission to get hurt.

230
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
This is the first time I was ever injured.

231
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Injured injured in my life. You know, real injury.

232
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
I packed all my shit up.

233
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
You know, I packed all that crap up into that kid bag.

234
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
So we're done my back. And I remember being really, really scared because there was no signal from my head to my arm.

235
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
You know, there was no transmission to make it move to make it work.

236
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And then I remember feeling my face and feeling blood.

237
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
That was superficial, but you know, I hit the cut was superficial, but I hit hard.

238
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
You know, against the aircraft. Boom, boom, boom, over and over.

239
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
And so I got all my shit and I packed it up and I bring you know into the turn and area.

240
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
And the black hats are scanned in the crowd.

241
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Because they know that somebody's fucked out of the area.

242
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
They saw it. And they're scanned in the crowd. And I'm going, oh my god, no body comes up to my to me.

243
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
He goes, hey bro, you look bad.

244
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Because I was, I guess just ashen white, you know, and I'm dry heaving stuff.

245
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And I look at my arm and he could see that it was the old school beat use.

246
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Like, Jen one beat use. I had roper and surround.

247
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And I go, yeah, man, I'm hurt really bad. I don't feel good.

248
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
And he said, it let me help you with that.

249
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
But my blouse and he looked and that's when I threw up because now I'm looking at this arm.

250
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And there was, there wasn't open.

251
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
But it was like translucent the skin.

252
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And there was no bicep. And he kept pulling it down and boom, there was in my form.

253
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
You know, by the.

254
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
And so the black hats see that and they come running over you.

255
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
The guy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Well, the meta-vac are he took off with some do with a broken femur.

257
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
The bird already took off.

258
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
So they had to bust me back on one of these blue bird school buses.

259
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
All the way to Martin Army Hospital.

260
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And then to add more insult to injury.

261
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
This is 1983.

262
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
So there's a bunch of dudes in there with grenade injuries.

263
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Like, real jump injuries.

264
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
You know, in the hospital's fill with these dudes, man, with rangers and guys from 82nd,

265
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
who have like real combat jump injuries.

266
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
And I'm here with this tow jumper, school 45th company,

267
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
and I don't feel bad drag, you know, injury.

268
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
I was like, oh my god, this sucks so bad.

269
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
That was the beginning of the career.

270
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
I mean, I had, but there was a lot of times like that.

271
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
You know, in my, like I said, I could write a book on how many times I have failed.

272
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
But they're funny. So I try to make it, I try to make it interesting and funny.

273
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
How did you, just to rewind a little bit, what did you do to get ready?

274
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
What did you know about special forces training?

275
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
What did you do to get ready prior to going in?

276
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Well, I didn't have, I had, oh, prior to going in.

277
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Yeah, probably the one I was wrestling.

278
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I was lifting weights.

279
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
I was doing a lot of hiking, you know, like camping and stuff.

280
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
And is that because you knew?

281
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Yeah, I knew there were a part of it.

282
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Yep.

283
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
I knew that there were woods men and stuff like that.

284
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
I had a buddy who was, he was, I was a boy scout.

285
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
I had a buddy who was an eagle scout and knew all the mountaineering stuff.

286
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
He was really good.

287
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
And we would go up and do ropes and repelling, you know,

288
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
it's also good for fear management when you're a kid.

289
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
You know, repelling off the side of a cliff is great.

290
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Stuff to help compartmentalize those, you know, fears of heights and things like that.

291
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
But I did a lot of woods running, you know, and just, I,

292
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.000
I think for me it was therapeutic and it was more about mental preparation than physical preparation.

293
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Physically, I was pretty freaking strong.

294
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
I was, I was very fit.

295
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
I was a very fit teenager, you know, and my, my latter teen years,

296
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
17, 18 years old.

297
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
I was very self-driven.

298
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
I wanted to be fit.

299
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
I saw that, you know, that I looked cool too, you know.

300
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And, uh, that's a freaking motivator bro.

301
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
When you're 17 and 18 and when you got a physique.

302
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
So like, yep, I'm going to, I need to work out more because damn.

303
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
It looks good.

304
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
So getting jacked.

305
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Yeah, getting jacked.

306
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Yeah, that now when you got in, what was the shock to your system?

307
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Like day two of boot camp.

308
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Uh, so regular boot camp, that was, that was scary as hell.

309
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
I love it how, how, you know, it's all theater.

310
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
But you don't know that.

311
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
No, you have no idea.

312
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
But here's the thing too.

313
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Day two, it was the actual day two.

314
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
See, they had the rules weren't in place yet in 1983 where,

315
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
there, there came a point where drill sergeants couldn't physically,

316
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
the beauties couldn't hit you.

317
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Yeah.

318
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
That point hadn't happened yet.

319
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Mm-hmm.

320
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
And I watched a drill sergeant right hook or a dude who, you know,

321
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
made a move at him.

322
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Uh, information.

323
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
You know, one of my peers private nothing.

324
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
He's zero.

325
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Uh, and he was at parade rest and the drill sergeant was yelling at him.

326
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
And they were both size for size.

327
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
You know, they both looked like badasses.

328
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
I remember looking at this, this punky kid in this drill sergeant.

329
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
They both looked like badasses.

330
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
And the kid, you know, made a jump boom and when I'm out of nowhere.

331
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
I mean hook right to the freaking jaw, timber, drop boom.

332
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Just dropped and I, oh, that was a scary thing I ever saw.

333
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
I never seen that in my life before, you know, like that.

334
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
I mean, I saw some street fights, but that, you know,

335
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Mono Romano, that, that fearless guy in that hook was so freaking fast.

336
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Uh, and then seeing that guy just timber.

337
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

338
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Yeah, I was, I was pretty scared.

339
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
I know that when people listen to podcasts and they'll send me a message and be like,

340
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
hey, I just joined.

341
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Just doing army, it's joined the Marine Corps, just joined the Navy.

342
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
And I always say listen, the first two weeks, you're saying thank you right now.

343
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
The first two weeks, you're going to be like,

344
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Haiti, you're going to wish you never listen to this podcast because it's such a

345
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
shock to your system to have every freedom that you have as a human being,

346
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
every sense of individuality and every sense of privacy, which is like three,

347
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
some of the three primary things that we value.

348
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
They're all gone.

349
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
They're gone.

350
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
It's a great culture shock.

351
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
I love the way they do it.

352
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
You know, I love it.

353
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
The culture shock is real.

354
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
You know, and if you're not used to it, you know, just some punky kid who is badass on the

355
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
wrestling team and then you, you know, then your heads get shaved off and then you're,

356
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
you look the same as everybody else and then, you know, you're sleep deprived.

357
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Sleep deprived.

358
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
What is that?

359
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
You know, and you have the time limit to eat in all, you know,

360
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
and then call the constant freaking yelling and screaming in your face.

361
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Yeah, I think they do, they did well with the industry-based training when I went in and

362
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
as I could recall, now I say kudos to those guys who were able to run it like that.

363
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
I mean, once again, off the theater, you know, when I look back, if I were to go right now through it,

364
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
I'm like, yeah, whatever.

365
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
I'll play your game.

366
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
I know you're not going to do anything to me.

367
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
It's just going to suck.

368
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
That's all.

369
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I think in though 83, 2, you had a bunch of Vietnam guys.

370
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Yes, or never mind still have a grenade up there.

371
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Damn, you guys had, you know, a lot of, I still had an omg guys in when I got to the teams,

372
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
but, you know, it had been 20 years.

373
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
So there's a lot of guys that retired at 20, a lot of guys that just got out after whatever they did two or three tours in Vietnam.

374
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000
But for you in 83, man, it was just, yeah, they were, they were, they were,

375
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:36.000
when I went out even when I went to the SF course, they were thick. Oh, how heavy Vietnam that's going through the SF course.

376
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Oh, going through it.

377
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Dang, yeah, they were thick.

378
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
And then when I got to a team and first group, you know, my team started was a 173 guy.

379
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
You know, in Vietnam, and they were, they were a diamond dozen.

380
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
I mean, you had all of the command were Vietnam, they were NCOs, you know, they were Vietnam,

381
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
they were E7s and above.

382
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
They were all Vietnam, that's.

383
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
So how long did it take you to recover from the towed jumpers scenario?

384
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
To jump or happened in October.

385
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
And I finished jump school a couple months later in end of February.

386
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
So you recovered and then went back to jump school?

387
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
No, no, that's when I ended jump school.

388
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Yes, I recovered and finished jump school end of February.

389
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Is something like pretty quick recovery?

390
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

391
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
And you had to get Biceps surgery, right?

392
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Yep.

393
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Yep.

394
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
And it was a mess because I split the Biceps in half.

395
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
It wasn't like it separated from the tendon.

396
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
It split the Bicep in half.

397
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
So they had to salvage it.

398
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
So it's about as big as the way it explains to me is the biggest round as a pencil.

399
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
So you could imagine the amount of strength that you lose, you know?

400
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
And you don't know how much you rely on a Bicep when it's.

401
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
When it has to work in compound with other most for instance doing pull-ups.

402
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Because when I got to the Q course.

403
00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
So now you're starting all the freaking screaming and yelling and sleep deprivation and food deprivation all over yet.

404
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
You're all over.

405
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
You just finished it.

406
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
But now you're doing more of it.

407
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Now you're back to being.

408
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
See you at straight from jump school.

409
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Yeah, Q course.

410
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Yep.

411
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Matter of fact, but yep, right to and I started the Q course.

412
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Am I 19th birthday?

413
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Yep.

414
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
March, yes, there was my birthday.

415
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
March 5th to 1984.

416
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
I started the Q course.

417
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And I'm March 4th.

418
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
And in Cat McAll first phase.

419
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:37.000
When they weren't screaming and yelling at you, you're doing classes patrolling and land-nav and survival and all this stuff.

420
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And you were able to get a hot A one hot meal a day.

421
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
If you could do 10 pull-ups with your kid on and climb the rope and you're kid on.

422
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
And most everybody was doing that.

423
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
I wasn't doing it because I had no Bicep.

424
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
And now this hurt my pride because I'm fit.

425
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
I mean, I was a pull-up master.

426
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
But I just finished all these months in hospital too.

427
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I hadn't done any PT.

428
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Nothing.

429
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:10.000
So I had to get back into shape while I was getting back into shape.

430
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
You know, during the training process, I had to get into shape.

431
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Because I was getting those hot rations.

432
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
And I did. It took a while.

433
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
But I got those things.

434
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And how long is a Q course?

435
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
For me.

436
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
It was a long time.

437
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Some of it depends on what your MOS is.

438
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Like your second phase.

439
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
And I don't know how they run it now as far as like phases go.

440
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
So there's a first phase which is all the basic skills.

441
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
You're a little bit more reliable.

442
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
You're patrolling.

443
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
All you're repelating.

444
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
All that stuff.

445
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
And getting yelled at.

446
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
You know, the first phase is sucks.

447
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Just the big suck fast.

448
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
There's classes in between suck.

449
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Second phase depends on what your specialty.

450
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Yes.

451
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
And you're an echo.

452
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Well, I started as weapons guy.

453
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Okay.

454
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Yep.

455
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
And then a third phase which is you know, big field exercise.

456
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Yep.

457
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Doing like your fids and your UW and all that.

458
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
The traditional special forces tasks.

459
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Right.

460
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
So.

461
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
But yeah, I I failed out of first phase.

462
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
And it was.

463
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I failed first.

464
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
I failed survival in first phase.

465
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Now, I was S.A. baby.

466
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Keep my end and the senior guys did not dig that they were

467
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
private.

468
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
It's going through the queue.

469
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Of course.

470
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
There was some animosity there.

471
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
They were digging that shit at all.

472
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
They were like keepers of the crypt.

473
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
You know.

474
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Survival was cool.

475
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
And I don't think they run it.

476
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
The same way anymore.

477
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
I'm not even sure they do it all.

478
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
But back in it was six days.

479
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
You got no food.

480
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
They send you.

481
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
They they drop you off in an area of like you were a national force.

482
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
And they give you one ration for those six days.

483
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
And it's either alive, chicken or live rabbit.

484
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Now they teach you prior to you know you get you learn all the

485
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
field craft stuff and everything you know how to make fire, how to

486
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
kill stuff all this stuff.

487
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
And then within those six days you have you have it list of 22 things

488
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
you have to accomplish.

489
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
And a lot of money is you know you got to build this massive signal.

490
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
You got to build the shelter you got to keep a fire going 24

491
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
seven.

492
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
You got to find water.

493
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
You got to filter water.

494
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
You know just a lot of things.

495
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
But I'm going to try to cut this one just a little short.

496
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
But I was I was thriving and survive.

497
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
I was kicking ass because I did a lot of it as a kid running around the

498
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
woods, fishing and stuff like that.

499
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
So I was crushing it and I found a pond.

500
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
That was within the confines of my because they told you you know

501
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
here is where you are.

502
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
You could only move within this amount this radius.

503
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
You know you can't go I forget what it was.

504
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
But within the confines of my.

505
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
My boundary I found a little pond.

506
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
It was right on the edge of it.

507
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Well where there's pond people fish where people fish people throw trash

508
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
and sure shit I find a little camping spot.

509
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
And and I found trash and I was licking like Yodel Rappers and stuff.

510
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
And I found a little remnants of chocolate.

511
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
And I found fishing line in the tree in the trees because guys were cast

512
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
and we you know so I climbed these trees and pull and meticulously pulled out

513
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
all these.

514
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
These nice long strings of of good fishing line,

515
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
bobber hooks all this stuff.

516
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
And as I'm looking around this campsite I see a beer cans sitting up on a log.

517
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
And I go over I feel it and I go oh man there's beer.

518
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
There's something in here smelling it.

519
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
So I cut the top open with my knife and sure enough you know it's like

520
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
two thirds full beer and there's bugs on it and I chuck a lug this thing.

521
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
And then I go fishing and I catch a string of load of these massive bluegills.

522
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
A string of load.

523
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
I mean like sustenance like like I'm going to get full today.

524
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Now when you when I went back to my campsite you know priorities

525
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
where it started over again get your fire going.

526
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Make sure you know everything square away because the tax or the instructors come

527
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
by every night to check on you make sure you're alive and they read your log

528
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000
because you got a log what you did during the day.

529
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
And he's looking at my stringer fish and I got some smoking you know.

530
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
And he's like what in the hell?

531
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
I said yeah I got it you know well all these fish and blah blah blah.

532
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.000
And and I was chock I found that worms are when you're hungry they are good.

533
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
And if you cook them there's they're just food bro.

534
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Yeah they're just I just food you know you cook them in a little bit of water

535
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
and you're in your canteen cup there's nothing freaking gross about them and they are good.

536
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
So I was I was chowin down not only on the worms but I was all this fish and I was smoking it.

537
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
I had me kill my chicken yeah this is like day three.

538
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
I had me kill chicken just walk I got them tied up with a little piece of the go to 550

539
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
court just walk around.

540
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Yeah he's like my body.

541
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
But that was part of the task I had to kill him eventually because that was

542
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
on the checklist but I was saving him for a rainy day but the instructors reading my log

543
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
and he goes what's this here about a beer and I go oh yeah yeah I found it blah blah.

544
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.000
And this chicken chicken motherfucker pulls out his wallet and pulls out a card and he goes you have the right to remain silent.

545
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Anything you say can he read me my rights bro.

546
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Because you know why because I was drinking beer on duty.

547
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Dude this is survival bro he was pissed and I was surviving.

548
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:53.000
So the end you were a private right and it was a private so that was the ten points so you have it.

549
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
There was this point system and I already lost a bunch of points just doing dumb ass shit.

550
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
But that was my last ten points I had to go I had to read they allowed me to recycle because I I

551
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
and this is the last thing you do in in first first thing sucks man it sucks.

552
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I remember you know I'm patrolling being so cold and sleep deprived deprived that I piss myself you know.

553
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Like 33% security.

554
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
I mean so now I have to do this all over again.

555
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
First face but that that was the story of my life in the military.

556
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
I mean that's the kind of thing though like you were saying earlier that's the kind of thing that gets people's heads.

557
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
All right because they know I'm not they say I'm not doing all this again.

558
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
I made it this far now you're going to tell me to do all that again.

559
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
You guys are stupid.

560
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
I'm going to be a part of this type of people that are assholes.

561
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
No, not happening.

562
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
They give your head for sure.

563
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:53.000
It was very easy when I left chemical and went back to Fort Bragg and got hot you know childhood

564
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
and me in a shower to go.

565
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Oh yeah this is this is come for you.

566
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
This is where I want to stay.

567
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
You know there's that point where you you could accept you know being mediocre

568
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
where I could see it and I was like no fucking way man.

569
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
I want that so bad I want that green beret so bad.

570
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
I really want that and they are giving me the opportunity.

571
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Because they didn't have to they could have said fuck you.

572
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
They're giving it to me hell.

573
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Yeah man I took that shit.

574
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Oh man.

575
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I did the same thing with combat die of school.

576
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
And when did you go to combat die of school?

577
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Was that where you were already at a group?

578
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Yeah so I was in first group before you get there.

579
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
What was the rest of you know the Q course?

580
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Yeah the Q course.

581
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Did you have to do language back then?

582
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Nope back then no language we did that when we got to group got it.

583
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Yep.

584
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So the rest of it just kind of it.

585
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
It's suck because you because you needed some experience.

586
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
You needed to know how to write an operations order and you needed to know what you

587
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
know five point cutinity plan was and pace report and O'Cook and all those acronyms.

588
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
You know it was a private you don't have any of that.

589
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Guys who were coming and they've had you know 80 second back 80 second Arab

590
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Born background or Rangers.

591
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
I mean they're actually square away squad leaders.

592
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

593
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
They knew the Ranger handbook you know by heart inside out.

594
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
I knew none of that shit none of it none of it.

595
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000
So thankfully there was these staffs aredons and he's seven who saw me and

596
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000
went there's something about you and they kind of took on the responsibilities

597
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
mentor and I jumped on it.

598
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
I jive hung out with those guys you know these guys were like first range of

599
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
battalion you know 80 second Arab I mean they were hardened

600
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.000
infantry dudes for like six years already and they knew all that shit all of it

601
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.000
because there's no way without them there's no way I would have made it no

602
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
freaking way you just don't have you don't have the freaking sense and you got to know

603
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
there comes a time when you're going through training like that where you got to know

604
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
you know what who am I going to align myself with.

605
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Who is it that I'm going to align myself with and and I can't look like a shit head

606
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
I got to make sure that I'm never late light out uniform because otherwise

607
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
these square to waste soldiers they're not going to want me to hang out with them.

608
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
You know if I'm just some piece of shit who's literally

609
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
strapping and onto them I want them to want me to hang out with them.

610
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000
So I made that happen by you know being work ethic you know

611
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
volunteer for the shit duties out in the field that kind of thing.

612
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Because nobody wants to volunteer you know when you're not patrolling nobody wants

613
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
to volunteer when you're patrolling and so I mean say we need to build this or go

614
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
on this reconnaissance and say oh but I could stay here in a patrol base.

615
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000
So I volunteer for everyone of those things but you know I learned a lot on those two

616
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:10.000
because I'm with some infantry badass dude some grunt and you know he's teaching me along

617
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
with me just OJT so I mean I made it by the skin of my teeth I would say

618
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000
you know that training I did not graduate is that on a graduate or anything like that

619
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
but you know down the road I did very well at different schools

620
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
but well it's like that thing where you know you get the kids in school that got

621
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
held back a year you know and they they do a lot better.

622
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
I mean obviously you know when you're that young and I was the same way

623
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
I was 18 and it's like I look back now and I'm like well I'm the same thing

624
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000
like okay I'm glad I made it through because there was guys that were a little older

625
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
and you just think man they had a they just knew more they were physically more developed

626
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
than I was and you know just just trying hang on man.

627
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Hang on.

628
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Yeah let me just snap a link to you man.

629
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Yep I got a little bit of a line.

630
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:08.000
That's another thing is in basic seal training there's you don't learn you basically

631
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
don't learn anything.

632
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Right it just six months of just so just yeah just this is just going to suck

633
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
you don't really you don't go on.

634
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
I mean like I said you don't go on patrols you know you go through the land war

635
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
fair phase which is six weeks and you go on a you know you go along homsts you do these

636
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000
little missions but it's not it's it's not anything it's you don't you're not actually

637
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000
learning anything you're just having to suck it off.

638
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
It's a good way to trim the fat though.

639
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
You don't really want to be here because SF what now they have you know like a selection

640
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
and assessment process back then it was called pre-phase.

641
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
So it was just a couple weeks of just beat down.

642
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Yeah that's it was PT four times a day and you know three hours of sleep a night

643
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
for a cup and there was no rhyme or reason to it.

644
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Nothing it was not a I don't think there was a single piece of hip pocket training

645
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000
you know it was just formation run push-ups sit-ups get up get down roll over

646
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:07.000
go clean this clean that pick up those pine cones PT again

647
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
it just yeah just to beat down but it was a good way to trim the fat for

648
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
you guys are like fuck this.

649
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Oh man.

650
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000
So you graduate you get through and then where where did you go from I went to first group

651
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
out of Fort Lewis and Washington.

652
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Yeah Arctic jungle.

653
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Yep.

654
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000

655
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Right.

656
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000
It's freaking awesome.

657
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Arctic jungle really yeah south wind your training area you know that's like a jungle

658
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000
and if big foot exists that's where he lives.

659
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
100% that's where he lives man.

660
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Holy crap.

661
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000

And he picks up the money and he picks up the bullets and he walks over to me and he looks at the money goes

738
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000

that than article fifty for sure.

742
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000
But my shit was wrapped so tight after that.

743
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
I mean I never ever ever fucked up again.

744
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:47.000

You know what I was talking about this another day like the.

746
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000

747
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Is.

748
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000

751
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Man it's like your whole life is pretty good because like when you're trying to stay safe you're trying to get

753
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000
It's such a.

754
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.000
It's it's you know when you hear there's a lot of the people run around now myself including.

757
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Well for me it's like oh.

758
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Guess how lucky I was I was a total knucklehead kid.

759
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:42.000
And and I had an aim my aim was this broad thing of like a ham and a try and be good seal.

760
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Right like if that's what you're trying to do man it just it puts you on a path right you know put you on a good path.

761
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Yep and it sounds like pretty similar for you getting on a good path.

762
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Hey I want to be a good special forces soldier and when you screw something up you tighten up even more.

763
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Yep and and and you know and.

764
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:08.000
They were always given me opportunity to improve myself and I never let one of those opportunities pass.

765
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
I mean do you want to go like combat dive skills like hell yet that's another one I failed by the way.

766
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000
How do you fail combat dive well here's the thing I do nothing about nothing.

767
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:24.000
No I had no idea what that's I thought I was going to like die for conquer shells and key west or something.

768
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:32.000
No idea none no preschool which is a prerequisite okay just that hey Pat Mack private Mac you're fit.

769
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Will you a water guy at all yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm yeah I'm strong in the water and I was on a water team Scott swim team okay with infert and first group.

770
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:50.000
So a lot of surface swimming you know just dragon a rock surface swim.

771
00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I went to combat dive school and once again you know everybody scream and actually your PT until you're freaking you know I got an embellicle hernia.

772
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
We peent 50s what's the embellicle hernia.

773
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But water is the great equalizer it is indeed there is no doubt about it and so when.

774
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:26.000
When they started having to do it cropped like the PT thing I was like all right this sucks the sucks been then you know you have a couple classes and then right to the pool and everybody scream and add you and you're trying to get your gear in as fast as possible.

775
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And you know you got these 2080s on your back and the second stage is stuffed into your BC and you're not breathing a stuff it just all wait 20 pound wait about.

776
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Mount the gunnell paired out of the water and then terror you know with the crossovers so the crossover thing to me blew my mind talk about you know.

777
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
How to make somebody humble you know how to suck the freaking life right out of you.

778
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.000
It's a clean crossovers so this particular pool you know it was what's what's a Olympic swimming pool.

779
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
The 50 by 25.

780
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Yeah it's pretty wide it's pretty.

781
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Yeah it's probably 50 by 25 so it's like 25 and this pool was nice it was 18 feet to Dean.

782
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:24.000
So you've got guys on each side of the gunnell so on each side of the pool so and you're you're you're.

783
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Chester back you're just stacked up and you got a mask on and you got your buoyancy compensator you got your 2880s you got a 20 pound wait belt you got air notes thanks you're just not breathing that regulator stuffed in your BC.

784
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So you got the instructor yell out prepare the crossover crossover so one you both sides go underwater and the objective is to make it to the other side.

785
01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:03.000
One side goes shallow one side goes deep and you come up and you get a few puffs before they say prepare the crossover crossover it ain't enough time.

786
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:15.000
No pre-scoob it you had you haven't experienced this and then you do it again and again and again and people start dropping like flies and what the.

787
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:28.000
When they're dropping is it quitting yeah with sometimes with me for example it wasn't necessarily I didn't say I quit I refused to get off the wall because it was a shock because I already had a shallow water black out.

788
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:44.000
They and with the shallow water black out it's basically once again the human body is cool because you won't let you drown unless you want to drown unless you inhale water you're you're going to pass out before that happens.

789
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:55.000
So when you hold your breath long enough you just pass out and their school that they should they know because they happen to people all time so they go down they freaking bring you up and usually as soon as you come back up and they slap you on the surface.

790
01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:06.000
You're you're revived you're coming out of it and then it takes you a while you know you're like holy shit that was scary and then they ask you once you're revived the give you some oxygen do you want to get back in the water.

791
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:14.000
The answer for me was yes I do and then I had another one and the next day during crossovers.

792
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:25.000
It was I had that other one they said you want to get back in the water yes I do another crossover and I couldn't get off the wall and the rule was they tell you three times and you're out get off the wall mister.

793
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:37.000
They want you to succeed they want it they want you to there's like I'm telling you that's the first one I'm going to give you another one mister get off my wall.

794
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.000
It's not get off my wall get off my wall you know they want they want you to want you're a you're a fellow SF right right yeah they want you to want this so.

795
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Super super professional cadre.

796
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I was volunteer for sure for instance I had a body who during ship bottom search.

797
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:28.000
You feel you're you're 28 is in the in the muck in that and and and you're basically wanting with your hand the bottom of this boat.

798
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:37.000
This ship and you could feel that ship rising and sinking just a little bit just a little bit just a couple inches but what happened to my body mind.

799
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:51.000
There was a type of cylinder rate type of jellyfish that was on the ship itself and when he was washing basically washing the ship they went down his blouse into his shorts and he got a freaking he got like.

800
01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Stung by jellyfish all the way from his chest always ball sack so it was medical emergency up on short this is a funny thing.

801
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:17.000
When we got him on shore he's going he's burning up you know it's jellyfish and so here's a grown man and this is one time where you don't question the shit we're a grown man is ripping his clothes open he's going piss on my face piss on my dick.

802
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We're all trying to you know we we're all shrunk up because we're frozen and we got a bix in our hands and we're like five dudes piss and I'm one guy.

803
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:34.000
He had a really bad reaction and he started throwing up and he failed the next days.

804
01:05:34.000 --> 01:06:03.000
So I was a little nervous because I didn't want to slow him down and we we mind the gut on when and boom you know got the surface got his bearings.

805
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
He gave me a freaking.

806
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:14.000
You know the go down signal and we start feeling and I am struggling to keep up with him and now I'm on his tether.

807
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
You know I'm like I can't I can't I have to keep up with his dude and he is an absolute cyborg.

808
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And that was a hardest I ever worked in my life because now I'm working for me I'm working for somebody else and I can't let this dude down you know it's like oh my god, but he crushed it he crushed it.

809
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
What was the time space between you failing dives going and going back in your.

810
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Okay so this is like oh no no six months that was six months.

811
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Yeah six months one year was for selection were you guys were you guys we guys going on deployments at this time.

812
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Yes, okay yeah and where were you guys to point to for us in first group was southeast Asia Thailand Malaysia those kind of things.

813
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yeah and it's cold war right yep cold war fed stuff peace time army.

814
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Yeah, dude did you have to learn a language at this point yeah I was pretty good at tie I didn't do it was a condensed course like a three month.

815
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You know see you learn all the survival skills and all that but yeah.

816
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And then then where did you go when you how long did you stay there for how long just first group well like three and a half years and then I got recruited.

817
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I got recruited by some dude.

818
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I got we're he had a list of 10 10 10 names on this on this sheet in the folder and company star majors told us we had to go to this meeting and he's some dude he's civilian clothes and he's got long hair.

819
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:57.000
The it's so vague what he's explained to us he goes yeah it's a cold war job and it's in Europe.

820
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
It's it kind of felt like will Smith a men and black when he's going now what are we doing here again.

821
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:10.000
What we're looking for the first or the best or the but you know that kind of shit had no idea but I knew it was something bigger than what I was doing currently so once again opportunity not.

822
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I pretty jumped on that ship man and what we were doing with that is how we were like.

823
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And that works for double agents working in Berlin.

824
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
So before that went and got German language as well.

825
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:35.000
But that was a cool job because it was some real cloaken dagger shit you know there's some books written about it now that are pretty cool did you go over there like undercover.

826
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:44.000
No that one no okay there's different times when I did we had it like that it was soft cover and you had to have for that one you have to have cover fraction cover status you know why you here.

827
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You know I'm just some military nougke because we had you know.

828
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Tracks to its leather jackets mallets you know you know all that freaking looking like Eastern euro trash.

829
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Body odor smoke and cigarettes.

830
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
That was a good one.

831
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I did that for about a year and a half and then.

832
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I got recruited by some other dude.

833
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000
He came and he was looking he had one name on his list that was mine.

834
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Well because I had there was certain things they were looking for it was a very.

835
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
The skill set was very particular.

836
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:37.000
He had to be good at the language he had to be good at like driving and there were certain different motor skills you know all these tests anyway I met the quote I met the data that he was looking for.

837
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And now this guy's in uniform but he's as F guy and I said there's another SF job here he goes yeah man he was we're spying on the Soviet army and so we eat Germany.

838
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Let's get the fuck out of here.

839
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I should have never heard of this.

840
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
It's just now there's only seven slots seven SF slots seven.

841
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
So I jumped on that one.

842
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:12.000
So that was more school as I had to go to whip it Warsaw Pack ID school in England more driving schools get my language because now I'm working in East Germany.

843
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.000
There's second language in English even you know what I'm talking about I mean you know.

844
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And I did that for about two years that was cool and once again you're going over there as an army dude on this one I was over as an army dude.

845
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000
The cover for action cover for status on that one is or we were liaison to the Soviet army.

846
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
They all knew what the hell we were doing.

847
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:44.000
It was paper thin man the cover was paper thin and it was all cat mouth they knew it they issue what they're doing it back to us.

848
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
They were doing it back to us in West Germany.

849
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
We were way more aggressive.

850
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I think at the time 95% of the intelligence on the Soviet army was coming from those units.

851
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:03.000
So in East Germany the US was doing it the French and the Brits and we would all rotate sectors and it was scary it was scary gay because.

852
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
They were the Soviets reserved the the right to.

853
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
To kill you.

854
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:17.000
They issued you maps and on these maps they had these yellow mark yellow areas and they were called PRAs permanently restricted areas.

855
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And you couldn't go in those those areas.

856
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Well that's where all the good shit was you know all the frigging KGB coms and all the new stuff.

857
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So we'd probe those things.

858
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And it was it was so the cover was paper thin how we were doing stuff was you know you had you were going over with two guys.

859
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
One of the guys was at sfdude.

860
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:53.000
The other was a an officer who was a so Russian fail or something like that or a into a weaning.

861
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
No no tactical skills whatsoever.

862
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I mean I remember sitting down when you say you go over with that we go from from West Berlin to East Germany into East Germany across the Gleeneca broker and we had a Soviet credentials.

863
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And we would go to the like the consulate or what was something like that and deliver mail.

864
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:28.000
So that was how we got in and we did it all the time it was you know several times we yeah and then when as soon as you cross the bridge and you deliver your mail.

865
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:36.000
You were you stayed in country now for about three days and you did your mission and you had.

866
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
You know a list of.

867
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Tass.

868
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I was jacked.

869
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Yes you had you had your essential task lists and and your will be will be like a task that you be.

870
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
So one of them would be.

871
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000
There's because satellite footage still existed so what's going on in cut bus.

872
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
There's a big mil to exercise what we need is.

873
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Just pictures of the vehicles and unit affiliation see who is there unit affiliation satellites can't get unit affiliation but you know we can get up close to the ball pictures of all the vehicles and the vins.

874
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Get unit affiliation another one might have been railways were a big one railways you know what's coming in from.

875
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:33.000
To check side polish side what is coming in to Falconburg into the work train station and it all actually was tarped but we we were experts in topology too we can read the piece of equipment under a target.

876
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:43.000
You know you're going to be a very important.

877
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I'm talking like.

878
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Beater.

879
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
80 p.b. to a regular to a beater 70 you know.

880
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Yeah we even know the variance under tarp it was it was good shit that was a fun ask freaking job.

881
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
We're traveling in a Mercedes-Benz.

882
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Because we're not undercover traveling because we're a liaison to say we don't.

883
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
So we're in a O.D. Green Mercedes-Benz.

884
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It's super dumb man.

885
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It was very very high speech in a low speed world.

886
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
You know we had a dashboard with toggle switches where you could control.

887
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:33.000
For instance as soon as you went over the bridge it was SOP turned off switch number one because I killed the horn because you don't want to have it horn A.D.

888
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
There was like a one switch where you another one you turn off the brake lights.

889
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
No the license plate illuminator.

890
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Okay.

891
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
But you had a brake light disable or you had even disabled one side.

892
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So from a distance you look like a motorcycle.

893
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
You know all that stuff.

894
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And then so it was a two-seater and the back was a big sheet of ethethome with holes cut.

895
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
And each hole filled a Nikon lens.

896
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And each lens was attached to an F1 body bro.

897
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Every freaking one of them.

898
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Yep so you just reached back boom 500 mirror.

899
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Just went to town and then we had a video.

900
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Camer, it's mounted like basically where the visors are with the remote on the dash.

901
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
So it was high speed shit in a low speed world.

902
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
For sure.

903
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Yeah it was fun.

904
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Yeah you helped man.

905
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Boom.

906
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Especially if you got a big hit because it was competition with the other tour guides.

907
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
We were called tour guides.

908
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So you know who could get the biggest hit.

909
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I got a SA24 new.

910
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
SA24 new in the time was called beatarits.

911
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And we heard that it might be coming in.

912
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And you know so we hung out and I was always with a square away officer at the time too.

913
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
He had been to range your school.

914
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
He wasn't a range but he had been to range your school.

915
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And he got a scholarship.

916
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
West Point scholarship for football.

917
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So he's a fit dude too.

918
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
So I was with this dude.

919
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So I was fired up and we were going after this SA24.

920
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And we ended up.

921
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
It's a long story.

922
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I'm just going to cut it short.

923
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
We were hiding behind a hay bail.

924
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
The land owner came out.

925
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
He smashed his the front of our vehicle.

926
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Because we're not we're trespassing.

927
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
We explain this is.

928
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Come in.

929
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
You're you're coming.

930
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
It's bro.

931
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
You don't own this shit.

932
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
This is so be it.

933
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
But he gets he apologize.

934
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
His invite us to his house.

935
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
His house is right on the tracks.

936
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
He's going to be a cool in the backyard.

937
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Orient the cameras.

938
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Check out the orientation and everything.

939
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Have a camera with us at the ready.

940
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Because they don't know what we're doing.

941
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
We're just fucking off in his field.

942
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
You know, he's Americans.

943
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
They service tea and coffee.

944
01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Train comes.

945
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
We get the whole video footage.

946
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
We get all the stills.

947
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
We get all the freaking numbers on it.

948
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
And we're sitting in this dudes backyard.

949
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Yeah.

950
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
So that was a big hit.

951
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
But yeah, that was a fun job.

952
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Because I got chased by all kind of shit like T80.

953
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
SS 21.

954
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And the thing about Soviet kids is there's so much of it.

955
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
So big.

956
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
You know, I mean, it's massive.

957
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Like there was this one called.

958
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Two pictures are p.

959
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Between triple stripes three p.

960
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
PTF.

961
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
PTF.

962
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Yeah.

963
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
It's like a, it's a tracked pontoon.

964
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
That takes tanks across the river.

965
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Got it.

966
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
It's just massive.

967
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
It's like the brana source of the kit world.

968
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
We have nothing that big, you know, and that moves that fast.

969
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And then there are BMP ones are like the velociraptors of the kit world.

970
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.000
You know, they're just, I mean, it's not, it's all in a horrible state of repair.

971
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
But if you got a shitload of it, it's not.

972
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
It's getting worse.

973
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
But that's cool that you were doing real stuff in the 80s.

974
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yeah, yeah.

975
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Yeah.

976
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Most of the guys at that time weren't doing anything.

977
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Yeah.

978
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
You know what, I was so fortunate.

979
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:16.80
I never, one of the things I'm, I'm careful is I always, I always, make sure I tell

980
01:18:16.80 --> 01:18:17.80
people that I was very fortunate.

981
01:18:17.80 --> 01:18:24.000
I was very lucky that I had the best mentors and I never, ever, breast of my laurels.

982
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
You know, I know the world's buckback there and how is the bad guys.

983
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Yeah, I'm a bad ass tomorrow.

984
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I don't need to rest in my laurels because I hate those guys.

985
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Yeah.

986
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Yeah, yesterday.

987
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And I don't reflect upon a lot, but it's interesting.

988
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Yeah.

989
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
It's interesting.

990
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
It was an interesting career.

991
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Yeah.

992
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And like, as I read some of the stuff that you don't, I kind of piece together, not just what's like out there,

993
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
but you know, I kind of piece together what I know about, you know, so I have a little bit more in that.

994
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I can feel in some holes.

995
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Yeah.

996
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And that's what got me thinking about, you know, when I was open up talking about like soldier skills.

997
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I think about all the different things that you did and how the variety in the career.

998
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And I know like when you, I mean, I know you went to some kind of camera school and you went to some identification in field developing.

999
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Yes.

1000
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
All that stuff.

1001
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
And I'm like, oh, yeah, he did all that.

1002
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And then he did scuba and then he did, you know, like everything that you've done.

1003
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
That's why I was asking about languages like that now you got tie.

1004
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
You got, you got like, you know, it skills.

1005
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Yeah.

1006
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And I'm scratching the surface.

1007
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Yeah.

1008
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Exactly.

1009
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It was so lucky.

1010
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
You know, because it's nothing.

1011
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I was, you know, I'm not like some stellar super soldier.

1012
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I was very lucky.

1013
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000
And I always make sure that when opportunity knocked in an answer to the door.

1014
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And that man, that paid off big time.

1015
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And then if I failed something, I wouldn't say, I fucking man, anything for me.

1016
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I'm like, no, I got to avenge that shit because I won't be defeated.

1017
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
That defeated me.

1018
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
No, there's no way.

1019
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I'm going back and kicking that ass.

1020
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
So what was next? What's the next?

1021
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000
So I was there through re-inification.

1022
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
That had to be crazy.

1023
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Yeah, that was cool.

1024
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
That was cool shit.

1025
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
So I was there through re-inification.

1026
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So, you know, the walk came down 89 re-inification 91.

1027
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
So I was there during that whole thing.

1028
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
But now my job is drying up.

1029
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And I'm having a train.

1030
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
The Bundesnahrisch deez.

1031
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
It's like a German FBI.

1032
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I'm pretty sure I got that right.

1033
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
It's been a long time since I accessed that database.

1034
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
But, um, so I have to train them.

1035
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And, uh, you know, we're handing over that job because they just have to see the withdrawal now.

1036
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
And all that.

1037
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I don't want any part of that.

1038
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So the next step was to go to, you know, try to get my foot in the door and use the sock.

1039
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Mm-hmm.

1040
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And so I went.

1041
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I've got to slot to go to selection.

1042
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Day-freakin-one.

1043
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I bring my ankle.

1044
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
How'd you break your ankle?

1045
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000
So, on the first day there's a, um, so no more yelling and screaming.

1046
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
There's no more at.

1047
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
You know, you're just taking a structure from a chalkboard and you're making sure you're not late.

1048
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Late, late, out of uniform.

1049
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And you're getting food, too.

1050
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
It's just, now it's, it's all big boy rules.

1051
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
You know, it's a totally different game.

1052
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It's totally different tests.

1053
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Totally, completely different, you know,

1054
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
it, because it tests resolve and whether or not you have heart and,

1055
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
if you're capable of deductive reasoning.

1056
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And if you are, um, resolute.

1057
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And if you have, um, um,

1058
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
uh, uh, uh,

1059
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
yeah, besides deductive, deductive reasoning,

1060
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
there's another term.

1061
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I'll think of it here in a second.

1062
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:46.000
But, um, so day-one, there's a, I won't disclose too much of it just because I don't want to ruin it for people who may go in the future.

1063
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
But there's a physical movement, you know,

1064
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
it's a movement and it's at night.

1065
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Uh, with a rock on, it's nothing hard.

1066
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And I think it's there kind of is a, uh, like a litmus test, you know,

1067
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
maybe to shank out patrol.

1068
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1069
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And you're on your own.

1070
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
You're doing this thing on your own.

1071
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
But it's at night.

1072
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Now you're not, you know, you're on dirt roads because you don't know it.

1073
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
They haven't given you any training yet.

1074
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
So you're on dirt roads and there's people periodically to guide you along the way.

1075
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And you have even have a flashlight.

1076
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
So it's nothing, you know, it's nothing crazy.

1077
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
It is just there to trim the fat and it does a good job at it.

1078
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Because it'll tell whether or not you're there for the right reasons.

1079
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
That'll, that'll tell the cadre.

1080
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
But I'm coming down hill and whenever you have the opportunity, you know,

1081
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
you double time down hills just to make your time.

1082
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And I roll an ankle and I roll it so bad that I hear a crack.

1083
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And I knew it was the ankle, you know, the, the spraying cracking,

1084
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
but I felt bone in my shin too.

1085
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Uh, and man, you know, it's the worst feeling.

1086
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.000
You know, when, for those of us who had spray, it's a, it's a horrible feeling.

1087
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
And the spray is worse than a break.

1088
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I swear to God, it's worse than all right.

1089
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
There's no doubt about it.

1090
01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I've done so many of them.

1091
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I've, I've torn so much shit in my body that, uh, man,

1092
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I'd rather be broken than torn.

1093
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Well, if the big difference is when you break a bone,

1094
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
you put it, you put it back together, you put a cast on it.

1095
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
It heals up.

1096
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
It's actually strong better than it was.

1097
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
But you terror ligament, the thing is never the same ever.

1098
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Yep.

1099
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
If it even heals.

1100
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Yep.

1101
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
So you hammer the shit out of your ankle.

1102
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Yeah.

1103
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And I, and I make it through this first movement.

1104
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And I think just, I just make the time.

1105
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I don't know what the time is.

1106
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Uh, and then I end up walking on it for another week and a half.

1107
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I'm going over these mountains in West Virginia.

1108
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Uh, but there came a point where I, where I say, you know what?

1109
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
This is a big boys game.

1110
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And they know I'm hurt because I went to see a doctor next day.

1111
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And my ankles, you know, like a football.

1112
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And they gave me some whatever.

1113
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Some Ranger candy, some cam of Muffered Asperger or something like that.

1114
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Uh, and they gave me an ace wrap.

1115
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Uh, that's it.

1116
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
But they knew I'm jacked up.

1117
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
And I thought, you know what?

1118
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
These guys, they, they're going to think I'm retarded.

1119
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
They're going to think I'm stupid.

1120
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Then I'm, you know, that I'm.

1121
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
So, uh, I, I made it.

1122
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I made it.

1123
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I wasn't, I was making no ground.

1124
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I was getting weaker by the day.

1125
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
So I sat by a dirt road, waited for a casual call to come.

1126
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
And I said, hey, I am, I am voluntary.

1127
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Von, I am withdrawing voluntarily.

1128
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
It was a hard pill of swallow, but the thing is, I had to do that.

1129
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Uh, and the guy said, hey, as long as you're not cheating yourself.

1130
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I said, nope.

1131
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I am not.

1132
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And they invited me to come back.

1133
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Well, because they knew that I was jacked up.

1134
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
If I volunteer, if I wasn't jacked up, there was no way.

1135
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
You quit something like that. There was no way.

1136
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
But they knew that I was jacked up, because I went.

1137
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I actually went and saw the, the dock.

1138
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
And I said, hey, can you give me something for this?

1139
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And he was like, what, what if you, whatever you just don't make the times,

1140
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
would there said, are you failed, you're out?

1141
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Well, I was one of those two is, uh, I didn't get to that point yet.

1142
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I didn't get to the stress phase of this course, you know.

1143
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
So it was just all the training, the training, uh,

1144
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000
uh, but the, uh, I forget what it's called, but it's like the training,

1145
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
yeah, the training phase, okay.

1146
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It wasn't the graded portion yet.

1147
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
So there was no, there was no maximum time.

1148
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Right.

1149
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
We could take in whatever hour.

1150
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
But I felt that I was getting weaker and weaker every day.

1151
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Um, so yeah, they invited me to come back.

1152
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And I took everybody, if you hear what I did to is,

1153
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I made a huge gamble.

1154
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I was in Germany, and I volunteered to go to Swick, special warfare center,

1155
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
and to be an instructor for your commitment.

1156
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I volunteered to go to that, to get me to Fort Bragg, to get me closer.

1157
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Uh-huh.

1158
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And did you also figure like if I'm there, and I'm all I'm doing is teaching,

1159
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I can get in good shape for a couple of times.

1160
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Right.

1161
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Yeah.

1162
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Yeah.

1163
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
But if, if I didn't make selection, I would have been stuck in Swick for four years.

1164
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
So I knew it was a gamble, but I said,

1165
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
it's going to get me there, and it's going to get me strong.

1166
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I'm not going to have to go anywhere.

1167
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I'm not going to, you know, like, yeah, it's a very light duty.

1168
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
And I worked out like a man possess.

1169
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I took it.

1170
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.000
I had a new, kind of a, a perspective and, um,

1171
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
a new strategy with the training.

1172
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I went very low impact.

1173
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
So I did a lot of bicycling, like in a, in the tiny,

1174
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
sprocket, a lot of stair climbing, stuff like that.

1175
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
A lot of, like, 40 repetition squats.

1176
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
And that kind of thing.

1177
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Because I already had a taste of it now.

1178
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
When you were worried about, like, being able to hump though?

1179
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Yeah.

1180
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Yeah. Well, I did that.

1181
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I helped.

1182
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
But I didn't do a lot of it.

1183
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I didn't do a lot of, uh, breakdown.

1184
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
What I did is I found a, um,

1185
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I had, there was this massive helopad on Fort Bragg right by where I was working.

1186
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So it's elevated chunk of ground.

1187
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And it's elevated, you know, on all sides at an angle.

1188
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And, um, I would do laps around that.

1189
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Because now I'm walking on a, on a traverse on an angle.

1190
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
So I got all that friction, you know, and working my angles.

1191
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
And I would do lap, and it was probably 400 yards around.

1192
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And I would, every day I'd go over there.

1193
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000
And I would do lap after lap after lap after lap after lap after lap after lap.

1194
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
And turn around, do the same thing.

1195
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
And to my feet, burnt because I wanted strong angles.

1196
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And I wanted, uh, tough, tough feet.

1197
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Because I already had some blisters when I went the first time.

1198
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
That second time, I didn't have a fucking blister.

1199
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I had a hot spot on the last exercise.

1200
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I had one hot spot.

1201
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Yeah, but I crushed it.

1202
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I crushed it next time.

1203
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I mean, I, I destroyed it.

1204
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I mean, I had some bad days, but when I went back,

1205
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
man, I, I, I, I figured I really, I tore into it.

1206
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So what year is, what year is this now that you, you go back and you made it?

1207
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
90 won.

1208
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
92 when I went back through.

1209
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Yeah, 92.

1210
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
So, so I'm thinking golf war.

1211
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
You got to go for it.

1212
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
You just finished.

1213
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I was still doing, uh, the Soviet stuff when people were doing the golf war.

1214
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Yeah.

1215
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Was that driving you crazy?

1216
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Nah, because I was doing stuff.

1217
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Yeah.

1218
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Yeah.

1219
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I was working, you know, and yeah.

1220
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I was happy.

1221
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I was in boot camp, or I was just after boot camp during the first golf war.

1222
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Yep.

1223
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And they, uh, I remember watching the news and they said they were expecting US 40,000 casualties in the first 48 hours.

1224
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
It was just like that.

1225
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
And I was like, oh, it's so hot.

1226
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
It's so hot.

1227
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
It's good to be so hot.

1228
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Yeah.

1229
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I'm going to get fast tracked.

1230
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
You're going to put me in the right freaking door gun or like, no.

1231
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
You're going to put me in the right freaking door gun or like, no.

1232
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
You're going to, you know, you're going to need people to replace.

1233
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Man, that's what's going to happen.

1234
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Yeah.

1235
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
So you get done.

1236
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
And so now you're, uh, you're there and everything's kind of leveled up.

1237
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
You're training freaking just like all the time.

1238
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Yeah.

1239
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Well, you know, uh, after selection, I had to go through six months of OTC.

1240
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And you're on the bubble during that time.

1241
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I mean, that's six months.

1242
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And there's no break in that six months.

1243
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I mean, and you're on the freaking bubble bro.

1244
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Man, I love that the way they reserved the right to fire your stinking ass at any freaking second for anything.

1245
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
And that went my whole, I was, I was at the uniform 13 years.

1246
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And I mean, there were stellar dudes, you know, 10 years in who,

1247
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
that little mistake boom.

1248
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
But, but you want to work in a place like that.

1249
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
You know, you want to, you want to be a part of that where, dude.

1250
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And I remember there were guys who were great dudes who had had, like,

1251
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I, I had this one friend who had an ND.

1252
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Ooh.

1253
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
He was by himself.

1254
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
And he went and turned himself in.

1255
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I was like, oh, holy shit.

1256
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And was that it? He's gone.

1257
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Yeah.

1258
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
And with NDs, there were certain things that you were,

1259
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
they'd send you back in for a year.

1260
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And you were able to get a relook.

1261
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Certain ND.

1262
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Uh, negligent discharge.

1263
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Okay, yep, yep.

1264
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Yeah.

1265
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Oops.

1266
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Yeah.

1267
01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1268
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And they didn't happen often, but when you're constantly around guns,

1269
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
you're constantly doing shit.

1270
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
All you need is a momentary lapse of reason.

1271
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And that's it.

1272
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
We are human beings.

1273
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
We are capable of momentary lapse of reason.

1274
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
And they happen to the best dudes I knew, man.

1275
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
The best dudes I knew.

1276
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
So you AD, ND, same thing.

1277
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
This is just a thing.

1278
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Yeah, they just changed the for a bitch.

1279
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Like, I don't know, but decade and a half ago.

1280
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Yeah, so there are no accidents.

1281
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It's negligent.

1282
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
I don't know. There's something.

1283
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
There's something to come from.

1284
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I never thought I never thought about that fact.

1285
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Yeah, yeah.

1286
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Yeah.

1287
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Yeah.

1288
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Because I, I, I've been on the range enough for I've seen,

1289
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
where I know that shit actually does happen.

1290
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I mean, I've got some great stories that are actual ADs.

1291
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Yeah.

1292
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Yeah.

1293
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Yeah.

1294
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Like around cooking off.

1295
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Not like a, like a guy dropping his backpack.

1296
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And he's got like a ALS holster on key.

1297
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Car key goes into the holster and full comes up.

1298
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Boom.

1299
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Is he dropping his backpack?

1300
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Burgers.

1301
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
You know, shit like that.

1302
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I've seen a bunch of things like that.

1303
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I've seen guys with like in the summertime out in the desert.

1304
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Oh, good enough.

1305
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Yeah.

1306
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
And they're like, like I remember, we were new guys.

1307
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And one of the guys with me, he shoot and all of a sudden,

1308
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
you know, he's kind of, uh, we're done.

1309
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
We're kind of debriefing all of a sudden.

1310
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Krak.

1311
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Oh, he literally, they held up his weapon.

1312
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
He was like, I don't know.

1313
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
He got into it.

1314
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
It's on safe.

1315
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
He's like, there was, there was another funny story.

1316
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
What Jason Gardner told me this story.

1317
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
They're debriefing.

1318
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And this guy, they're sitting there debriefing the new

1319
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Kellhouse stuff.

1320
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
They're debriefing.

1321
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
And all of a sudden, like, did the junior officer

1322
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
cracks off around at the feet of like the debrief group.

1323
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And he said he like looked at the gun and he looks at the

1324
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
group and he goes, he was decocking it.

1325
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000
He had like an out of body experience and he explained

1326
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
himself in the third person.

1327
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000
He's like the funniest thing that he was, I got to have

1328
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Jason Gardner because my buddy Jason, he was

1329
01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Master Chief and he's been on the podcast a couple times.

1330
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
But he always tells everything in like a monotone voice.

1331
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
So he goes, yeah.

1332
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
So he cracks off around right at the feet of our of our group.

1333
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
And then he shakingly looks at everyone and says he was

1334
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
decocking it.

1335
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Oh, my god.

1336
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Kill me.

1337
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So as you're doing this, one of their skills are you now picking up.

1338
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I mean, you aren't it's the end.

1339
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I got to figure out a place where there's money and

1340
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
there's time and there's a mission.

1341
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Let me think about first up more driving.

1342
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I mean, I've been through seven driving courses.

1343
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
One of them was the Gary Semic Motorcross.

1344
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Well, we had dirt bikes, you know, and it's a great

1345
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
mobility device, but you need training on that thing.

1346
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
So when I was a team sergeant at a mobility team, I said, I want

1347
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
the best training.

1348
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I want to motor cross, you know, super cross school.

1349
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
But so driving training.

1350
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I mean, more water stuff, water water.

1351
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
So riverine stuff.

1352
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
You know, it was cool.

1353
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I just thought about that.

1354
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
They, the dunk training like Epic Marl.

1355
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Yeah, rotten thing.

1356
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Yeah, yeah, I did that.

1357
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
But schools, let me think.

1358
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Yeah, he dunker.

1359
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Yeah, yeah.

1360
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Oh, my god, they're so freaking much.

1361
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Oh, so the demo was the big thing when you, you know,

1362
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
but special, specializing in that.

1363
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I mean, were you like a breacher?

1364
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Yeah, but everybody is a breacher at some point.

1365
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
You know, when you're an operator, you're all, you're a

1366
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
breacher at some point.

1367
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
You know, you come onto a team as a assistant, then you work

1368
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
up to a breacher.

1369
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
But then the amount of weapons, too, you know, so not just

1370
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
cruiser stuff, but like an tank and, you know, it's a

1371
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
holy crap because there's always something new emerging.

1372
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Yeah.

1373
01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Yeah.

1374
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
You can't just lug around a goof off, you know?

1375
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
All the time, because more stuff is emerging.

1376
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
What are the kind of tricks?

1377
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
It just went on and on and on.

1378
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I mean, it never, the wheels on the bus went round and

1379
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
freaking round.

1380
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.000
And the amount of heel of stuff that we did, you know,

1381
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000
and a lot of different environmental training.

1382
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
So, you know, when we did winter training, it was hard

1383
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
for winter training, when we did desert training, hard

1384
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
court desert, we did mountain, you know, all that stuff.

1385
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And then, so a lot of environmental stuff.

1386
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
I mean, yeah, I wish I was tasked with a homework

1387
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
site prior to, so I could have written those things down

1388
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
because it's cool because it's cool because I, I

1389
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
forget about how much shit that I've learned.

1390
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
The amount of shit that I've forgotten could probably, you

1391
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
know, fill volumes.

1392
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And then, you know, I've been doing things.

1393
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
But everyone's long ago.

1394
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Oh, yeah.

1395
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Like Rebecca and I watch a TV show.

1396
01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I go, yeah, I've done that.

1397
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
She goes, you have it.

1398
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Yeah, I've done that.

1399
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Yeah, I've done that.

1400
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
And you're shooting just all the time.

1401
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yeah, yeah, all the time.

1402
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And then not only that, but what was cool is,

1403
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
we were encouraged to compete, you know,

1404
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
a national level with the shooting stuff.

1405
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
So, I'm not just talking action shooting like

1406
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I'm shooting like Ipsick, but I also did national match, you know,

1407
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
like bulls, I stuff.

1408
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Yeah, I competed in the all army,

1409
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
small-arms championship too in 2004 right before I retired.

1410
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000
So I was at E9 and the unit sent me down there as a, like, a recruiting trip.

1411
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And best competition I went to.

1412
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Now, they did preface it with a, you know,

1413
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
you got to win this thing.

1414
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Now, no freaking, I tell you,

1415
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
that was not easy to, I did, but one of these tasks.

1416
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Because you got like 250 competitors.

1417
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
And you got these, the A&E, the army,

1418
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
the army, the army, the army, the army, the army,

1419
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
the army.

1420
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
The army, the army, the army, the army, the army, the army, the army, the army.

1421
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Yeah, who do that.

1422
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Right, that's the day they do their living.

1423
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
You got, um, Ranger Snipers, 82nd Snipers,

1424
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
because when you show up to that type of competition,

1425
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
you all look the same, every same haircut, same uniform,

1426
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
same M16, A2, iron sights, same side arm, same ammo.

1427
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Yeah, same ammo, everything's the same.

1428
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
It's like stock car racing.

1429
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Exactly.

1430
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.08
I think I'm just like that.

1431
01:36:15.08 --> 01:36:17.24
So no mechanical advantage with anything.

1432
01:36:17.24 --> 01:36:19.04
Nothing.

1433
01:36:19.04 --> 01:36:21.40
And then you start this week long competition.

1434
01:36:21.40 --> 01:36:24.88
In the first several days, it's all national match rifle

1435
01:36:24.88 --> 01:36:27.68
at 500 yards iron sights.

1436
01:36:27.68 --> 01:36:30.88
Grand U-Shoot, you know, 77 grain Sierra match black hills.

1437
01:36:30.88 --> 01:36:32.48
You shoot good ammo.

1438
01:36:32.48 --> 01:36:37.72
So you're really able to group with these rifles.

1439
01:36:37.72 --> 01:36:43.52
But after the rifle portion, I was sitting good.

1440
01:36:43.52 --> 01:36:45.20
I was like out of 250 people.

1441
01:36:45.20 --> 01:36:47.56
I was probably like 225.

1442
01:36:47.56 --> 01:36:50.40
But when the pistol portion came up, I crushed everybody.

1443
01:36:50.40 --> 01:36:52.80
So it was because thankfully it was a combined aggregate.

1444
01:36:52.80 --> 01:36:58.04
So I was able to, yeah, I was able to, who I did not want to go back to you and say,

1445
01:36:58.04 --> 01:37:01.28
yeah, I came in third or something like that.

1446
01:37:01.28 --> 01:37:05.08
You know, I've got beat by a E4 from division.

1447
01:37:05.08 --> 01:37:09.04
Where were you when September 11th kicked off?

1448
01:37:09.04 --> 01:37:12.04
So I was at that time, I was a OTC instructor.

1449
01:37:12.04 --> 01:37:14.60
So operator trainer course instructor.

1450
01:37:14.60 --> 01:37:20.88
I was on the range teaching OTC students, CQB.

1451
01:37:20.88 --> 01:37:23.84
One guy had a piece of equipment go it out.

1452
01:37:23.84 --> 01:37:24.68
I said, I'll go get it.

1453
01:37:24.68 --> 01:37:25.36
I'll go get it for you.

1454
01:37:25.36 --> 01:37:27.64
Just give me that and I'll go de-exit for you.

1455
01:37:27.64 --> 01:37:33.36
So I drive back down to the main buildings, go in and the,

1456
01:37:33.36 --> 01:37:39.24
that's for the guy from supply is watching the TV and one of the planes that already hit.

1457
01:37:39.24 --> 01:37:40.24
And I said, what happened there?

1458
01:37:40.24 --> 01:37:45.24
He goes, ah, some plane hit one of the trade, one of the world trade center towers.

1459
01:37:45.24 --> 01:37:46.68
And I go, oh, two.

1460
01:37:46.68 --> 01:37:47.68
Was it actually?

1461
01:37:47.68 --> 01:37:48.72
He goes, oh, it looks like it's me.

1462
01:37:48.72 --> 01:37:50.56
Because at the time that's where it was.

1463
01:37:50.56 --> 01:37:56.48
And plus people, you couldn't grasp the gravity of how big those buildings are.

1464
01:37:56.48 --> 01:37:57.84
You know, they thought it was a sessinath.

1465
01:37:57.84 --> 01:37:59.48
I completely thought it was a sessinath.

1466
01:37:59.48 --> 01:38:00.48
Yeah.

1467
01:38:00.48 --> 01:38:01.48
That's how it would be.

1468
01:38:01.48 --> 01:38:03.76
Those buildings are gigantic.

1469
01:38:03.76 --> 01:38:07.48
So we're both watching it and then I saw live the second one go in.

1470
01:38:07.48 --> 01:38:10.84
And we both just dude, when you, when you watch that shit,

1471
01:38:10.84 --> 01:38:13.64
like happened, I didn't see it on the news as a repeat.

1472
01:38:13.64 --> 01:38:20.48
I watched it live and I heard the news, the announcer go, oh, oh boy, oh, oh, oh.

1473
01:38:20.48 --> 01:38:23.52
All right, nope, this is no accident.

1474
01:38:23.52 --> 01:38:25.04
You know, now I'm a holy fuck.

1475
01:38:25.04 --> 01:38:28.80
So I got this piece of kit, boogie down range.

1476
01:38:28.80 --> 01:38:32.92
And we did an admin halt brought everybody back into the childhood.

1477
01:38:32.92 --> 01:38:33.92
Big TVs on.

1478
01:38:33.92 --> 01:38:37.72
So they get kind of an update and then brought them back to the shoothouse around C.

1479
01:38:37.72 --> 01:38:39.52
K. B.

1480
01:38:39.52 --> 01:38:40.52
Yeah.

1481
01:38:40.52 --> 01:38:43.52
How long did it take from there before you got over to?

1482
01:38:43.52 --> 01:38:46.20
It's me, it, it, oh man, I was so bummed out.

1483
01:38:46.20 --> 01:38:50.56
It was you were, it was an instructor, not only that, but they asked me to do another

1484
01:38:50.56 --> 01:38:53.76
six months on top of my two-year stay.

1485
01:38:53.76 --> 01:38:59.68
Because there was a course that they were putting together for somebody else.

1486
01:38:59.68 --> 01:39:01.28
And they want to meet and build this course.

1487
01:39:01.28 --> 01:39:07.72
And I'm going, oh my god, squatters are already on their second to poorly bro.

1488
01:39:07.72 --> 01:39:08.72
And this is the crazy thing.

1489
01:39:08.72 --> 01:39:09.72
That's a good thing.

1490
01:39:09.72 --> 01:39:10.72
That's a good thing.

1491
01:39:10.72 --> 01:39:16.56
It's funny because when I get over there, I remember the first night, I'm with this

1492
01:39:16.56 --> 01:39:19.20
dude, I put through selection and OTC.

1493
01:39:19.20 --> 01:39:21.32
He's a staff sergeant.

1494
01:39:21.32 --> 01:39:22.32
And I'm an E9.

1495
01:39:22.32 --> 01:39:25.60
And he goes, oh, man, it's so cool that I'm doing hits with you here.

1496
01:39:25.60 --> 01:39:27.80
I said, yeah bro, it's not your charge of me.

1497
01:39:27.80 --> 01:39:28.80
He goes, huh?

1498
01:39:28.80 --> 01:39:29.80
I said, how many hits you got in cud you?

1499
01:39:29.80 --> 01:39:30.80
It was 125.

1500
01:39:30.80 --> 01:39:33.36
I said, well, I got zero bro.

1501
01:39:33.36 --> 01:39:34.36
Yeah.

1502
01:39:34.36 --> 01:39:35.36
Goosec.

1503
01:39:35.36 --> 01:39:38.32
So when you went over, you went over, you were telling me earlier, like you went over

1504
01:39:38.32 --> 01:39:40.44
as like an ops position or something?

1505
01:39:40.44 --> 01:39:48.44
Yeah, initially I went over as an ops position with the, it's a funny thing.

1506
01:39:48.44 --> 01:39:50.36
We didn't even touch on this one.

1507
01:39:50.36 --> 01:39:58.88
I went over to work with the units support support squadrons.

1508
01:39:58.88 --> 01:40:02.68
So I was working with all, these guys would know training.

1509
01:40:02.68 --> 01:40:05.84
And they're going outside of the green zone and all that to get re-supplied to get

1510
01:40:05.84 --> 01:40:10.08
you could go in there, they're making buy-app runs to get diesel, you know, going down

1511
01:40:10.08 --> 01:40:11.08
right.

1512
01:40:11.08 --> 01:40:15.60
Yeah, bro, it's off skin homers, you know, because we were nothing was up on.

1513
01:40:15.60 --> 01:40:17.68
And so I'm driving with them, scared, scared us.

1514
01:40:17.68 --> 01:40:20.92
I've been in my life, going with cooks to get freaking food.

1515
01:40:20.92 --> 01:40:22.64
I'm one man security detail.

1516
01:40:22.64 --> 01:40:29.64
I got comms, ARP, M4, mags, and I'm out there flopping.

1517
01:40:29.64 --> 01:40:34.000
I'm one man security detail for dudes who have zero training.

1518
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.56
They got guns and stuff too.

1519
01:40:35.56 --> 01:40:44.08
But I know that, that, that, that, that stay scared these shit out of me.

1520
01:40:44.08 --> 01:40:50.16
The amount of freaking rounds that the support guys were taking and I'm going, go, go,

1521
01:40:50.16 --> 01:40:53.96
you know, because we, mobility survived building.

1522
01:40:53.96 --> 01:40:57.64
I'm like dudes, first lesson, it's hardest shoot in moving target.

1523
01:40:57.64 --> 01:41:00.48
You were not doing these other, we're not driving 15 miles an hour.

1524
01:41:00.48 --> 01:41:01.48
Fuck that.

1525
01:41:01.48 --> 01:41:05.44
As fast as this is if you could go, change lanes on the bridges, you know, that kind of stuff.

1526
01:41:05.44 --> 01:41:07.84
All that old school shit.

1527
01:41:07.84 --> 01:41:12.000
I mean, yeah, that scared to hell out of me.

1528
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.16
And then I would do a couple of hits with the working squater.

1529
01:41:16.16 --> 01:41:22.80
But when I got back and between those, I built a course called CSE, come at skills

1530
01:41:22.80 --> 01:41:23.80
course.

1531
01:41:23.80 --> 01:41:26.56
It's a two-week course for all of support elements.

1532
01:41:26.56 --> 01:41:28.84
And it was, they loved it, first.

1533
01:41:28.84 --> 01:41:29.84
They freaking loved it.

1534
01:41:29.84 --> 01:41:34.80
They were, because you start to be our basic rifle marksmanship, you know, and then movement

1535
01:41:34.80 --> 01:41:35.80
with a rifle.

1536
01:41:35.80 --> 01:41:40.20
And then security positions, working barricades, driving.

1537
01:41:40.20 --> 01:41:45.60
And then, you know, react to freaking IEDs, you know, all this stuff.

1538
01:41:45.60 --> 01:41:49.88
So, reaction contact, move to from all that stuff.

1539
01:41:49.88 --> 01:41:59.04
So we did all, just two weeks of non-stop, balsh and a wall, basic training, combat skills

1540
01:41:59.04 --> 01:42:00.04
training.

1541
01:42:00.04 --> 01:42:03.04
And the fulfillment I got out of that was ridiculous.

1542
01:42:03.04 --> 01:42:06.76
I loved doing that so much.

1543
01:42:06.76 --> 01:42:09.84
Because the job is hard, it's freaking sucked.

1544
01:42:09.84 --> 01:42:15.88
But, you know, these cooks and law guys, you know, seeing them freaking rip rounds and shoot

1545
01:42:15.88 --> 01:42:17.44
AT-4s and stuff.

1546
01:42:17.44 --> 01:42:22.68
And then when I go back to Iraq, walking around, we got a hit, it's kind of vanilla.

1547
01:42:22.68 --> 01:42:29.28
But, the cool thing was, too, when no matter how vanilla the freaking hit was, guys were

1548
01:42:29.28 --> 01:42:35.08
treating it as if it were, you know, HVT, you know, high value target.

1549
01:42:35.08 --> 01:42:36.68
I was like, hell yeah.

1550
01:42:36.68 --> 01:42:40.76
But, there was a couple vanilla hits where I'd go and get my cooks.

1551
01:42:40.76 --> 01:42:43.20
And say, hey, you guys want to come out of hit me.

1552
01:42:43.20 --> 01:42:44.20
They were like, really?

1553
01:42:44.20 --> 01:42:45.20
I see, yeah, man.

1554
01:42:45.20 --> 01:42:51.36
And I put them on, you know, security position with a, with a, with a saw or a mag 58.

1555
01:42:51.36 --> 01:42:53.56
But dude, they're in fucking combat bro.

1556
01:42:53.56 --> 01:42:54.56
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1557
01:42:54.56 --> 01:42:59.24
One of the cooks even got to freaking, wow, you ready to get, I got to let it rip.

1558
01:42:59.24 --> 01:43:04.76
I had, I had my radio man, my radio man from my tactical operations center, right?

1559
01:43:04.76 --> 01:43:06.56
And he was the guy that kind of ran things.

1560
01:43:06.56 --> 01:43:10.56
And one night, we were going on an office, pretty close to base, you know, kind of a no

1561
01:43:10.56 --> 01:43:12.04
brainer.

1562
01:43:12.04 --> 01:43:13.04
And I needed it.

1563
01:43:13.04 --> 01:43:14.84
But we had a bunch of people to coordinate with.

1564
01:43:14.84 --> 01:43:19.64
And I said, hey, man, you know, can you come out with me tonight and, and, you know, just

1565
01:43:19.64 --> 01:43:20.64
man, the radio.

1566
01:43:20.64 --> 01:43:22.16
And he gets the big eyes.

1567
01:43:22.16 --> 01:43:24.04
Because you know, hey, let's face it.

1568
01:43:24.04 --> 01:43:27.52
I mean, even though I'm saying it's no big deal, man, there was guys getting wounded.

1569
01:43:27.52 --> 01:43:28.52
He'll never say it today.

1570
01:43:28.52 --> 01:43:33.80
So, even though I thought it was no big deal, his eyes got real big and he's like,

1571
01:43:33.80 --> 01:43:34.80
yes, sir.

1572
01:43:34.80 --> 01:43:39.52
And so we get out and we did, by this point, this was a six, we had armored, armored

1573
01:43:39.52 --> 01:43:45.40
home v's and we get on target and, you know, I'm out, we got multiple targets going down

1574
01:43:45.40 --> 01:43:46.40
and I'm the GFC.

1575
01:43:46.40 --> 01:43:51.28
So I'm kind of conducting and seeing what's going on and I walk over to, he's in the

1576
01:43:51.28 --> 01:43:52.28
hummer.

1577
01:43:52.28 --> 01:43:54.40
And I go over and I kind of like crack the door open.

1578
01:43:54.40 --> 01:43:57.72
I was like, hey, man, you want to come out and, you know, like, you know, I'll show

1579
01:43:57.72 --> 01:43:58.72
you what's up what's going on.

1580
01:43:58.72 --> 01:44:03.68
And he's like, I'm good to go right here.

1581
01:44:03.68 --> 01:44:04.68
I was like, I like the sights and sounds.

1582
01:44:04.68 --> 01:44:05.68
I don't know.

1583
01:44:05.68 --> 01:44:07.20
I was like, hey, it's all good, man.

1584
01:44:07.20 --> 01:44:08.20
You just chill.

1585
01:44:08.20 --> 01:44:09.20
But I mean, he was a great guy.

1586
01:44:09.20 --> 01:44:14.72
He did all kinds of good work for me, but, you know, we do that with the support people

1587
01:44:14.72 --> 01:44:18.36
because they just, they don't get good training.

1588
01:44:18.36 --> 01:44:22.32
And so they're normally not super comfortable.

1589
01:44:22.32 --> 01:44:23.32
Yeah, rolling out.

1590
01:44:23.32 --> 01:44:25.60
I had a CD too.

1591
01:44:25.60 --> 01:44:32.64
Who is this giant black dude, awesome guy named Biggie?

1592
01:44:32.64 --> 01:44:34.28
Yeah, Biggie.

1593
01:44:34.28 --> 01:44:37.72
He was, he was awesome, but we took him on a couple where we had work to do.

1594
01:44:37.72 --> 01:44:39.20
We had work for the CBS to do it.

1595
01:44:39.20 --> 01:44:40.36
Some locations.

1596
01:44:40.36 --> 01:44:44.96
And man, you know, see, he, he, he, he, he, he turned for Biggie.

1597
01:44:44.96 --> 01:44:45.96
Just a big eyes man.

1598
01:44:45.96 --> 01:44:46.96
Right.

1599
01:44:46.96 --> 01:44:47.96
He was awesome.

1600
01:44:47.96 --> 01:44:48.96
And one time we got hit.

1601
01:44:48.96 --> 01:44:56.000
We got hit with, we got hit with mortars in the camp and they blew up our big water tank.

1602
01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.16
And so he was just, you know, he was a, a CB, which CBs are known for, you know, acquiring

1603
01:45:01.16 --> 01:45:02.16
things.

1604
01:45:02.16 --> 01:45:07.36
So he went out in the next few hours and acquired a brand new like giant water tank.

1605
01:45:07.36 --> 01:45:10.08
We're talking, you know, I don't know how many, but as big as this, right, that we're

1606
01:45:10.08 --> 01:45:15.60
sitting, a giant, he brings back another one on a crane and Peter's skin.

1607
01:45:15.60 --> 01:45:18.96
He's like green for a, he's getting it all filled up with water.

1608
01:45:18.96 --> 01:45:23.52
And, you know, I said, hey, man, hey, I go, hey, chief, that's awesome.

1609
01:45:23.52 --> 01:45:25.12
And really appreciate it.

1610
01:45:25.12 --> 01:45:26.40
Appreciate, you know, taking care of us.

1611
01:45:26.40 --> 01:45:30.04
He goes, man, I'll do whatever I got to do to help you guys as long as they're

1612
01:45:30.04 --> 01:45:32.04
right, no more boom boom in the camp.

1613
01:45:32.04 --> 01:45:33.04
Yes.

1614
01:45:33.04 --> 01:45:34.04
Yes.

1615
01:45:34.04 --> 01:45:45.04
By the way, big, I saw big, warming up with three, 15 on bench, warming up.

1616
01:45:45.04 --> 01:45:46.04
10 reps.

1617
01:45:46.04 --> 01:45:48.04
Yes, that's what you were playing around.

1618
01:45:48.04 --> 01:45:49.04
Yeah.

1619
01:45:49.04 --> 01:45:50.04
Yeah.

1620
01:45:50.04 --> 01:45:55.04
And so, so the second time when you went back and you guys are doing these hits.

1621
01:45:55.04 --> 01:45:56.04
So now what year is that?

1622
01:45:56.04 --> 01:45:57.04
Oh, fine.

1623
01:45:57.04 --> 01:45:58.04
Yeah, so things are great.

1624
01:45:58.04 --> 01:46:00.04
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1625
01:46:00.04 --> 01:46:03.04
Things, things escalated a lot between 04 and 05.

1626
01:46:03.04 --> 01:46:04.04
Yep.

1627
01:46:04.04 --> 01:46:05.04
Yep.

1628
01:46:05.04 --> 01:46:07.04
I guess somewhere of 04 starting to get normally.

1629
01:46:07.04 --> 01:46:08.04
Right.

1630
01:46:08.04 --> 01:46:09.04
05.

1631
01:46:09.04 --> 01:46:14.04
And, or you guys are, you guys are going out hitting targets reload.

1632
01:46:14.04 --> 01:46:18.04
I mean, yeah, a lot of times like re-cock right there on the spot.

1633
01:46:18.04 --> 01:46:21.04
And so, battlefield interrogation, all right, this guy knows.

1634
01:46:21.04 --> 01:46:26.04
So, and so, let's go freaking split the force and go check these dudes out.

1635
01:46:26.04 --> 01:46:29.04
And then bam, police them up.

1636
01:46:29.04 --> 01:46:32.04
A lot of cool black police work.

1637
01:46:32.04 --> 01:46:40.04
You know, snatch and do, I tell people, like people who don't know.

1638
01:46:40.04 --> 01:46:43.04
You know, when you're trained and when you're living that kind of unit,

1639
01:46:43.04 --> 01:46:45.04
kill and a dude isn't very hard.

1640
01:46:45.04 --> 01:46:49.04
Snatching up a dude requires a lot of freaking work.

1641
01:46:49.04 --> 01:46:54.04
You know, especially, like, let's say plausible deniability or no trace, that kind of thing.

1642
01:46:54.04 --> 01:46:56.04
So, I love that kind of stuff.

1643
01:46:56.04 --> 01:46:58.04
That was, to me, that was a lot of fun.

1644
01:46:58.04 --> 01:47:02.04
It was interesting, you know, snatch and doots up out of their beds and crap like that.

1645
01:47:02.04 --> 01:47:07.04
But it was, um, the uptempo was really high.

1646
01:47:07.04 --> 01:47:12.04
And what I appreciated was being basically like a cherry.

1647
01:47:12.04 --> 01:47:14.04
You know, I was a private in I.

1648
01:47:14.04 --> 01:47:15.04
Yeah.

1649
01:47:15.04 --> 01:47:20.04
And, oh, that's probably the only place in the world in the military where you have the opportunity to do that.

1650
01:47:20.04 --> 01:47:22.04
Being an E9 door kicker.

1651
01:47:22.04 --> 01:47:28.04
I mean, I had this one night because it was like, by third night going into, um,

1652
01:47:28.04 --> 01:47:30.04
Felicia on my own little bird.

1653
01:47:30.04 --> 01:47:36.04
And I was following an anteem and, um, we're, you know, landing rooftops.

1654
01:47:36.04 --> 01:47:42.04
And the third night in a row, they had me on the planning board as task force man.

1655
01:47:42.04 --> 01:47:44.04
It was killing me.

1656
01:47:44.04 --> 01:47:45.04
What the, you know what they were doing.

1657
01:47:45.04 --> 01:47:49.04
They were, they were giving me an opportunity to make up ground because they had been getting some.

1658
01:47:49.04 --> 01:47:53.04
And I'd been left freaking back.

1659
01:47:53.04 --> 01:47:57.04
So they were like, yeah, we're going to, you know, we're going to, we're going to, yeah.

1660
01:47:57.04 --> 01:48:01.04
Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was cool to shit.

1661
01:48:01.04 --> 01:48:07.04
But seeing all the level at which dudes operated, seeing that,

1662
01:48:07.04 --> 01:48:12.04
because I was almost from like an outside perspective, you know, looking around, going holy fuck man.

1663
01:48:12.04 --> 01:48:13.04
This is pro.

1664
01:48:13.04 --> 01:48:15.04
This is badass.

1665
01:48:15.04 --> 01:48:21.04
Well, I think the whole US military obviously, I mean, this goes without saying.

1666
01:48:21.04 --> 01:48:25.04
But they did just a, the experience.

1667
01:48:25.04 --> 01:48:29.04
I mean, I always tell people that are always a little bit surprised, but, you know,

1668
01:48:29.04 --> 01:48:33.04
I didn't shoot my weapon at the enemy for 13 years, right?

1669
01:48:33.04 --> 01:48:39.04
In the, in the sea, until 13 years of, and I think I locked my locked and loaded my weapon prior to that,

1670
01:48:39.04 --> 01:48:44.04
like, three times all on a stupid, like, I was kind of fired up because we were doing security for something.

1671
01:48:44.04 --> 01:48:46.04
And I got to lock the weapon and I was kind of pumped.

1672
01:48:46.04 --> 01:48:47.04
Yeah, yeah.

1673
01:48:47.04 --> 01:48:55.04
But then, but it wasn't until 13 years, but the amount of combat that we have had now in the US military,

1674
01:48:55.04 --> 01:48:58.04
repetition after repetition after repetition.

1675
01:48:58.04 --> 01:49:02.04
And one thing I noticed is like, well, on my first appointment, which was O3,

1676
01:49:02.04 --> 01:49:07.04
we, you know, we were good at doing, you know, building take downs and we, we,

1677
01:49:07.04 --> 01:49:08.04
do room clearance.

1678
01:49:08.04 --> 01:49:10.04
And we, we were, we were good at it.

1679
01:49:10.04 --> 01:49:15.04
By the time I went back in O6, man, everybody was, everyone could, you know, everyone could just,

1680
01:49:15.04 --> 01:49:16.04
there was no factor.

1681
01:49:16.04 --> 01:49:18.04
It was like, hey, all you want to take down was building cool.

1682
01:49:18.04 --> 01:49:19.04
We got this.

1683
01:49:19.04 --> 01:49:23.04
It was, it had brought everybody up to a much better level.

1684
01:49:23.04 --> 01:49:27.04
And I always, I think about this now all the time, just the experience that we have.

1685
01:49:27.04 --> 01:49:34.04
Now, you know, a mission that would have seemed like a huge deal in 1996.

1686
01:49:34.04 --> 01:49:35.04
Right.

1687
01:49:35.04 --> 01:49:36.04
You wouldn't even know.

1688
01:49:36.04 --> 01:49:38.04
It wouldn't even crack the bump on the radar.

1689
01:49:38.04 --> 01:49:40.04
Like that was cool.

1690
01:49:40.04 --> 01:49:41.04
Right.

1691
01:49:41.04 --> 01:49:42.04
Right.

1692
01:49:42.04 --> 01:49:43.04
Yeah.

1693
01:49:43.04 --> 01:49:44.04
That even close.

1694
01:49:44.04 --> 01:49:45.04
Yeah.

1695
01:49:45.04 --> 01:49:46.04
Yeah.

1696
01:49:46.04 --> 01:49:47.04
It was, you know, the amount of experience that we've gained.

1697
01:49:47.04 --> 01:49:53.04
And, and, you know, even when I watch new platoons come in to relieve us.

1698
01:49:53.04 --> 01:49:58.04
And like occasionally I'd be in that spot, like looking at my task unit,

1699
01:49:58.04 --> 01:50:01.04
looking at one of my platoons moving down the street.

1700
01:50:01.04 --> 01:50:04.04
And you just see and you go, man, these guys are so good.

1701
01:50:04.04 --> 01:50:08.04
I mean, everybody's moving. It's like weapons trained everywhere.

1702
01:50:08.04 --> 01:50:08.04
Yeah.

1703
01:50:08.04 --> 01:50:10.04
It's so efficient.

1704
01:50:10.04 --> 01:50:13.04
And you see like a new troop coming in and you look at them and you go,

1705
01:50:13.04 --> 01:50:14.04
Oh, they'll clean it up.

1706
01:50:14.04 --> 01:50:15.04
They'll clean it up.

1707
01:50:15.04 --> 01:50:15.04
Yeah.

1708
01:50:15.04 --> 01:50:16.04
They'll clean it up.

1709
01:50:16.04 --> 01:50:20.04
Because you can tell that by as demeanor, you know, by as just the body language alone.

1710
01:50:20.04 --> 01:50:24.04
You know, you, you, you just, the silhouette, you know, who that guy is for sure.

1711
01:50:24.04 --> 01:50:25.04
Oh, for sure.

1712
01:50:25.04 --> 01:50:25.04
Yeah.

1713
01:50:25.04 --> 01:50:26.04
For sure.

1714
01:50:26.04 --> 01:50:32.04
When you, so now it's, you do, you knock out a couple deployments.

1715
01:50:32.04 --> 01:50:37.04
What, what makes you decide to get out?

1716
01:50:37.04 --> 01:50:39.04
What makes you decide to retire?

1717
01:50:39.04 --> 01:50:44.04
I had a, some of it was, and I don't mind talking about this because it's good lesson learned shit.

1718
01:50:44.04 --> 01:50:47.04
A lot of it was because of domestic messiness.

1719
01:50:47.04 --> 01:50:54.04
I had little kids at home and they had a, they weren't being brought up right.

1720
01:50:54.04 --> 01:50:56.04
I needed to be there for them.

1721
01:50:56.04 --> 01:51:00.04
I had already, you, you start to think,

1722
01:51:00.04 --> 01:51:07.04
you know, when you, when you lose buddies that are close to you, you start to, you know, reflect.

1723
01:51:07.04 --> 01:51:15.04
And you, and you, and you, you start to be very objective and you exercise introspection and you go dude man, if that's me.

1724
01:51:15.04 --> 01:51:25.04
I don't really care, you know, I'm just some dude, but I'm going to leave my kids dry because they don't have the other, they're other half.

1725
01:51:25.04 --> 01:51:30.04
You know, they're, they're mom at the time. Really sucked.

1726
01:51:30.04 --> 01:51:38.04
So I got out because I had little kids and they needed, they needed me because they didn't have the other half of that.

1727
01:51:38.04 --> 01:51:41.04
And they, they have sucked bad.

1728
01:51:41.04 --> 01:51:45.04
And it was, it was a, because of,

1729
01:51:45.04 --> 01:51:50.04
the problem stem from, it's big farm a shit, you know, prescription meds.

1730
01:51:50.04 --> 01:51:53.04
So not a drug problem if it's, you know, prescription meds.

1731
01:51:53.04 --> 01:51:57.04
They have free and big farm a bro, they, they have shit pisses me off.

1732
01:51:57.04 --> 01:52:02.04
But so I watched the deterioration of a human being over, you know, a long time.

1733
01:52:02.04 --> 01:52:07.04
Big farm I mentioned, she free and, just sucked.

1734
01:52:07.04 --> 01:52:10.04
So, but I had to, I had to do it.

1735
01:52:10.04 --> 01:52:20.04
And, you know, initially I thought this is a great idea, but man, it wasn't long before I ran it to just a feeling horrible about myself and missing the hell out of it.

1736
01:52:20.04 --> 01:52:26.04
But what was the time span between you made the decision that you're going to retire and like when you retired?

1737
01:52:26.04 --> 01:52:38.04
I've made the decision the first time I pushed to Iraq as an, I'm at the 22 year mark because I was e9.

1738
01:52:38.04 --> 01:52:49.04
I needed to stay in grade for three years and complete the academy to keep e9 on my retire and retire and retire and I decarbed kind of thing.

1739
01:52:49.04 --> 01:52:53.04
So I wanted to make sure that I retired with that stuff.

1740
01:52:53.04 --> 01:52:58.04
So, yeah, I made that decision, got the academy right before I retired.

1741
01:52:58.04 --> 01:53:02.04
I think I did the academy and retired two days later.

1742
01:53:02.04 --> 01:53:07.04
And then you retire, what was your plan when you retired?

1743
01:53:07.04 --> 01:53:09.04
I had no plan there you go.

1744
01:53:09.04 --> 01:53:10.04
Zero.

1745
01:53:10.04 --> 01:53:11.04
Check.

1746
01:53:11.04 --> 01:53:16.04
But I got a fire job offers like, yeah, I got hired prior to retiring.

1747
01:53:16.04 --> 01:53:17.04
There you go.

1748
01:53:17.04 --> 01:53:19.04
A couple months to that becomes the plan.

1749
01:53:19.04 --> 01:53:20.04
Yep.

1750
01:53:20.04 --> 01:53:22.04
And the thing is that's a little hanging fruit.

1751
01:53:22.04 --> 01:53:24.04
I don't recommend that to people.

1752
01:53:24.04 --> 01:53:28.04
That little hanging fruit shit man, you know working for the man.

1753
01:53:28.04 --> 01:53:29.04
Fuck that.

1754
01:53:29.04 --> 01:53:31.04
And this is a five, you know, five.

1755
01:53:31.04 --> 01:53:33.04
So contracting is still.

1756
01:53:33.04 --> 01:53:34.04
Oh yeah.

1757
01:53:34.04 --> 01:53:35.04
Good money.

1758
01:53:35.04 --> 01:53:35.04
Yep.

1759
01:53:35.04 --> 01:53:38.04
This is before the market was when I returned to another shit hole.

1760
01:53:38.04 --> 01:53:39.04
Yep.

1761
01:53:39.04 --> 01:53:41.04
The reason I got out was to be there for my kids.

1762
01:53:41.04 --> 01:53:43.04
So I didn't want to, you know,

1763
01:53:43.04 --> 01:53:51.04
make a shit ton of money and deploy again for 30, 30 days without the big green machine at my six.

1764
01:53:51.04 --> 01:53:52.04
For sure.

1765
01:53:52.04 --> 01:53:56.04
Uh, because now I lost some buddies doing contracting stuff too.

1766
01:53:56.04 --> 01:53:58.04
Uh, and it was just kill me bro.

1767
01:53:58.04 --> 01:53:59.04
It was kill me.

1768
01:53:59.04 --> 01:54:00.04
Oh my god.

1769
01:54:00.04 --> 01:54:01.04
So it was the job that you go.

1770
01:54:01.04 --> 01:54:06.04
So it was basically, um, doing what I'm doing now is,

1771
01:54:06.04 --> 01:54:10.04
but for a corporation, I was doing the instruction thing and I was building,

1772
01:54:10.04 --> 01:54:14.04
this unit called the AWG.

1773
01:54:14.04 --> 01:54:15.04
Mm-hmm.

1774
01:54:15.04 --> 01:54:17.04
A symmetrical warfare group.

1775
01:54:17.04 --> 01:54:18.04
Yep.

1776
01:54:18.04 --> 01:54:18.04
Yeah.

1777
01:54:18.04 --> 01:54:19.04
I was building that.

1778
01:54:19.04 --> 01:54:21.04
You sent some people over to me in Ramadi.

1779
01:54:21.04 --> 01:54:22.04
Yeah.

1780
01:54:22.04 --> 01:54:25.04
I was trying to land up and I was trying, the other thing I was doing was,

1781
01:54:25.04 --> 01:54:28.04
I built a course called Kat Sea Combat Application Training Course.

1782
01:54:28.04 --> 01:54:30.04
And we were training big army.

1783
01:54:30.04 --> 01:54:33.04
Um, I recruited a couple other guys,

1784
01:54:33.04 --> 01:54:35.04
couple guys like me retired unit guys.

1785
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:38.04
And we were training big army.

1786
01:54:38.04 --> 01:54:40.04
It five day course.

1787
01:54:40.04 --> 01:54:42.04
And I loved when we first started it,

1788
01:54:42.04 --> 01:54:44.04
we were doing training first brigade,

1789
01:54:44.04 --> 01:54:46.04
82nd Airborne Division.

1790
01:54:46.04 --> 01:54:47.04
Fourth brigade, fourth brigade.

1791
01:54:47.04 --> 01:54:49.04
Fourth brigade was fit for a little while.

1792
01:54:49.04 --> 01:54:51.04
And I loved that these guys were so badass.

1793
01:54:51.04 --> 01:54:54.04
You know that there were E4s with two deployments.

1794
01:54:54.04 --> 01:54:56.04
And we combat wounds.

1795
01:54:56.04 --> 01:54:57.04
Yeah.

1796
01:54:57.04 --> 01:54:59.04
By the way, two deployments that were 13 months.

1797
01:54:59.04 --> 01:55:00.04
Yeah.

1798
01:55:00.04 --> 01:55:01.04
I thought he'd been watching.

1799
01:55:01.04 --> 01:55:02.04
Yeah.

1800
01:55:02.04 --> 01:55:06.04
Uh, and they were so badass and their soldier skills were, you know,

1801
01:55:06.04 --> 01:55:12.04
so far surpassed then what I had seen in like the 90s or certain.

1802
01:55:12.04 --> 01:55:16.04
Um, so that was what's again very fulfilling.

1803
01:55:16.04 --> 01:55:18.04
You know, run in these guys,

1804
01:55:18.04 --> 01:55:20.04
hard getting them really good training

1805
01:55:20.04 --> 01:55:24.04
and making them focus on the fundamental fundamentals,

1806
01:55:24.04 --> 01:55:27.04
fundamentals being expert at the basics.

1807
01:55:27.04 --> 01:55:29.04
You know, that was, that's still as my thing.

1808
01:55:29.04 --> 01:55:33.04
But that was our thing where we were training the Kat Sea Program.

1809
01:55:33.04 --> 01:55:36.04
And we were going to be expert on the basics and fundamentals.

1810
01:55:36.04 --> 01:55:37.04
Um, so that was fun.

1811
01:55:37.04 --> 01:55:39.04
I did that for a few years.

1812
01:55:39.04 --> 01:55:41.04
And then I got, um,

1813
01:55:41.04 --> 01:55:43.04
I got laid off.

1814
01:55:43.04 --> 01:55:45.04
What the fuck is that me?

1815
01:55:45.04 --> 01:55:46.04
You know what?

1816
01:55:46.04 --> 01:55:48.04
You have no, when you're career military guy.

1817
01:55:48.04 --> 01:55:50.04
And then you're working for, you know,

1818
01:55:50.04 --> 01:55:53.04
a company that does government contract and shit in his entire military.

1819
01:55:53.04 --> 01:55:55.04
You're not even thinking job security.

1820
01:55:55.04 --> 01:55:59.04
That's not even, that's not a party or thought process.

1821
01:55:59.04 --> 01:56:00.04
You don't go bad at night and say,

1822
01:56:00.04 --> 01:56:04.04
Oh, hope it will get fired tomorrow. If you don't think that, you don't think it.

1823
01:56:04.04 --> 01:56:06.04
So laid off things.

1824
01:56:06.04 --> 01:56:08.04
And I didn't even see the rating on the wall.

1825
01:56:08.04 --> 01:56:09.04
Because I'm dumb.

1826
01:56:09.04 --> 01:56:10.04
I'm corporate America.

1827
01:56:10.04 --> 01:56:11.04
I don't know any of that.

1828
01:56:11.04 --> 01:56:13.04
Um, so the company got bought out.

1829
01:56:13.04 --> 01:56:15.04
And they started to, uh,

1830
01:56:15.04 --> 01:56:18.04
you know, cut corners, trying to fat,

1831
01:56:18.04 --> 01:56:20.04
pitch pennies, all that stuff.

1832
01:56:20.04 --> 01:56:22.04
And I was thinking, oh, yeah, we got to do it.

1833
01:56:22.04 --> 01:56:24.04
You know, got to cut those corners, got to pitch those pennies.

1834
01:56:24.04 --> 01:56:25.04
I wasn't thinking about me.

1835
01:56:25.04 --> 01:56:27.04
And I cost money to that.

1836
01:56:27.04 --> 01:56:30.04
And they laid me off with a phone call, man.

1837
01:56:30.04 --> 01:56:31.04
Phone call.

1838
01:56:31.04 --> 01:56:33.04
You know, not even face the face.

1839
01:56:33.04 --> 01:56:36.04
And the feeling, because I was already down at that time.

1840
01:56:36.04 --> 01:56:38.04
I was really bummed out.

1841
01:56:38.04 --> 01:56:40.04
I was, um, I was in a dark, dark place.

1842
01:56:40.04 --> 01:56:41.04
I was going through depression.

1843
01:56:41.04 --> 01:56:43.04
I was freaking drinking on the job.

1844
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:45.04
I can not, on the range.

1845
01:56:45.04 --> 01:56:48.04
But I would bring, like, a jacket coke to work in a kid.

1846
01:56:48.04 --> 01:56:50.04
A big coke of coal about what stuff like that.

1847
01:56:50.04 --> 01:56:51.04
I was hating life.

1848
01:56:51.04 --> 01:56:52.04
I was miserable.

1849
01:56:52.04 --> 01:56:54.04
And that's what you got your, your,

1850
01:56:54.04 --> 01:56:56.04
uh, I guess she's your ex wife now.

1851
01:56:56.04 --> 01:56:57.04
Yep.

1852
01:56:57.04 --> 01:56:59.04
She's dragging things down.

1853
01:56:59.04 --> 01:57:05.04
Yeah, no support whatsoever disconnected from your former teammates that you spent your entire life with.

1854
01:57:05.04 --> 01:57:06.04
Yep.

1855
01:57:06.04 --> 01:57:08.04
It has no concept about that stuff.

1856
01:57:08.04 --> 01:57:13.04
Not only disconnected from that, but disconnected from reality because of, like, prescriptions,

1857
01:57:13.04 --> 01:57:14.04
and stuff.

1858
01:57:14.04 --> 01:57:16.04
So no connection between the Nora or receptors.

1859
01:57:16.04 --> 01:57:17.04
Just dark space.

1860
01:57:17.04 --> 01:57:19.04
Everyone's in a while targeted opportunity.

1861
01:57:19.04 --> 01:57:21.04
You know, a moment of clarity.

1862
01:57:21.04 --> 01:57:23.04
But it, that all that shit sucked bad.

1863
01:57:23.04 --> 01:57:30.04
Then getting laid off, you know, on top of it was like, holy fucking then the, the other half.

1864
01:57:30.04 --> 01:57:33.04
Say, no, I'll just get a job with another company.

1865
01:57:33.04 --> 01:57:36.04
And I'm like, fuck that man.

1866
01:57:36.04 --> 01:57:38.04
I want to do something else.

1867
01:57:38.04 --> 01:57:41.04
So I call three guys who own companies.

1868
01:57:41.04 --> 01:57:43.04
All good friends of mine.

1869
01:57:43.04 --> 01:57:44.04
All ex-unic guys.

1870
01:57:44.04 --> 01:57:46.04
And they also the same thing.

1871
01:57:46.04 --> 01:57:47.04
Yep.

1872
01:57:47.04 --> 01:57:48.04
I will get you back.

1873
01:57:48.04 --> 01:57:49.04
I will get you work if you need it.

1874
01:57:49.04 --> 01:57:50.04
But do it, man.

1875
01:57:50.04 --> 01:57:51.04
Do it yourself.

1876
01:57:51.04 --> 01:57:54.04
You can, you have the ability to do this.

1877
01:57:54.04 --> 01:57:59.04
So they all gave me permission to be my own guy.

1878
01:57:59.04 --> 01:58:01.04
Best thing that ever could happen.

1879
01:58:01.04 --> 01:58:02.04
Because I was 10 years ago.

1880
01:58:02.04 --> 01:58:06.04
And I generated my company T-max and it just freaking detonated.

1881
01:58:06.04 --> 01:58:08.04
It went bashing.

1882
01:58:08.04 --> 01:58:09.04
Yep.

1883
01:58:09.04 --> 01:58:11.04
I mean, there's absolutely no business.

1884
01:58:11.04 --> 01:58:12.04
You know, there's absolutely no business.

1885
01:58:12.04 --> 01:58:13.04
There's absolutely no business.

1886
01:58:13.04 --> 01:58:16.04
You know, like, you know, I ripped off my motor.

1887
01:58:16.04 --> 01:58:19.04
I had to go through the sequestration 2013.

1888
01:58:19.04 --> 01:58:22.04
I'll let Devices spending bullshit where I had all got to my contract

1889
01:58:22.04 --> 01:58:23.04
stuff for the year.

1890
01:58:23.04 --> 01:58:25.04
And that likes which went out of the menu.

1891
01:58:25.04 --> 01:58:26.04
No money.

1892
01:58:26.04 --> 01:58:27.04
None.

1893
01:58:27.04 --> 01:58:30.04
At the same time, I'm going through divorce.

1894
01:58:30.04 --> 01:58:33.04
You know, and do that was hard.

1895
01:58:33.04 --> 01:58:34.04
That was hard.

1896
01:58:34.04 --> 01:58:35.04
But that was good.

1897
01:58:35.04 --> 01:58:36.04
It was freaking odd.

1898
01:58:36.04 --> 01:58:37.04
It was so good.

1899
01:58:37.04 --> 01:58:38.04
Those kind of lessons learned.

1900
01:58:38.04 --> 01:58:41.04
You know, you really grow as a human being.

1901
01:58:41.04 --> 01:58:46.04
Based on how you, how you come out of a bad situation like that.

1902
01:58:46.04 --> 01:58:47.04
You know, how.

1903
01:58:47.04 --> 01:58:54.04
How you, for me, it was making lemonade out of lemons.

1904
01:58:54.04 --> 01:58:59.04
You know, and trying to rekindle my past, trying to remember who I was.

1905
01:58:59.04 --> 01:59:02.04
What I'm here for, what my purpose is.

1906
01:59:02.04 --> 01:59:04.04
And then I had to give myself meaning.

1907
01:59:04.04 --> 01:59:07.04
You know, I needed to be.

1908
01:59:07.04 --> 01:59:11.04
They're needed to be a reason for me to get up every freaking day.

1909
01:59:11.04 --> 01:59:12.04
A new mission.

1910
01:59:12.04 --> 01:59:14.04
Yeah, every day, new mission.

1911
01:59:14.04 --> 01:59:15.04
Yep.

1912
01:59:15.04 --> 01:59:17.04
Especially special.

1913
01:59:17.04 --> 01:59:19.04
Not just military guys, but special.

1914
01:59:19.04 --> 01:59:21.04
They need that purpose.

1915
01:59:21.04 --> 01:59:23.04
They need that mission.

1916
01:59:23.04 --> 01:59:27.04
So without meaning, without purpose.

1917
01:59:27.04 --> 01:59:29.04
You, you, you could, you could fall through.

1918
01:59:29.04 --> 01:59:33.04
You can, you can, you can, you could, you know, start slipping into dark places.

1919
01:59:33.04 --> 01:59:34.04
And you were slipping there.

1920
01:59:34.04 --> 01:59:36.04
Dude, I, I almost capitulated.

1921
01:59:36.04 --> 01:59:37.04
I was close.

1922
01:59:37.04 --> 01:59:38.04
I mean, I was dark.

1923
01:59:38.04 --> 01:59:40.04
I was at the bottom.

1924
01:59:40.04 --> 01:59:41.04
Bottom.

1925
01:59:41.04 --> 01:59:44.04
And then I was at, you know, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was last three years.

1926
01:59:44.04 --> 01:59:47.04
I lived in the bonus room, I bought my garage for five years.

1927
01:59:47.04 --> 01:59:50.04
I lived in the bonus room, I bought my garage.

1928
01:59:50.04 --> 01:59:54.04
I wasn't a drunkard, but I was drinking all day.

1929
01:59:54.04 --> 01:59:56.04
So nobody knew it.

1930
01:59:56.04 --> 01:59:58.04
You know, that I was, that I was medicating.

1931
01:59:58.04 --> 02:00:00.04
Nobody knew it because I would just all day long.

1932
02:00:00.04 --> 02:00:01.04
All day long.

1933
02:00:01.04 --> 02:00:03.04
How do you know, 11 o'clock in the morning?

1934
02:00:03.04 --> 02:00:04.04
Start.

1935
02:00:04.04 --> 02:00:09.04
Um, and I had no, I mean, I would go to work.

1936
02:00:09.04 --> 02:00:11.04
I would get jobs.

1937
02:00:11.04 --> 02:00:15.04
And I was fake in it. I was fake in the, you know, get you so.

1938
02:00:15.04 --> 02:00:17.04
But I go, you know, I'm all that.

1939
02:00:17.04 --> 02:00:18.04
I was just fake in the Mac show.

1940
02:00:18.04 --> 02:00:19.04
Just fake in it.

1941
02:00:19.04 --> 02:00:20.04
Nobody knew where I was.

1942
02:00:20.04 --> 02:00:22.04
Nobody had any idea.

1943
02:00:22.04 --> 02:00:25.04
Um, because I had no, I wasn't like hanging.

1944
02:00:25.04 --> 02:00:27.04
I had no close friends or anything like that.

1945
02:00:27.04 --> 02:00:29.04
My kids were my close friends.

1946
02:00:29.04 --> 02:00:33.04
Uh, and they were my kind of, my sanctuary or my escape.

1947
02:00:33.04 --> 02:00:35.04
You know, hanging out with them.

1948
02:00:35.04 --> 02:00:36.04
Are you still working out?

1949
02:00:36.04 --> 02:00:38.04
At that time, not very much.

1950
02:00:38.04 --> 02:00:42.04
I mean, I'm getting by because everything that I did,

1951
02:00:42.04 --> 02:00:46.04
my, my now ex thought it was because I was having an affair.

1952
02:00:46.04 --> 02:00:51.04
You know, so there's no explanation for me working out other than wanting to fuck somebody.

1953
02:00:51.04 --> 02:00:53.04
You know, there's no explanation.

1954
02:00:53.04 --> 02:00:56.04
Everything that I did was because it's an affair.

1955
02:00:56.04 --> 02:01:01.04
And I had in her mind, I mean, it was bad when people, when, you know,

1956
02:01:01.04 --> 02:01:03.04
when I say, yeah, my ex is crazy.

1957
02:01:03.04 --> 02:01:05.04
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1958
02:01:05.04 --> 02:01:06.04
Oh, yeah, yeah, I say no.

1959
02:01:06.04 --> 02:01:08.04
Man, I'm not talking about your cut.

1960
02:01:08.04 --> 02:01:10.04
I'm talking legit crazy.

1961
02:01:10.04 --> 02:01:15.04
I had a girlfriend, imaginary girlfriend living in her closet for four years.

1962
02:01:15.04 --> 02:01:17.04
Her name was skater.

1963
02:01:17.04 --> 02:01:18.04
Damn.

1964
02:01:18.04 --> 02:01:21.04
I would come home and the cops would be at my house.

1965
02:01:21.04 --> 02:01:25.04
And she had taken all the light switch panels off.

1966
02:01:25.04 --> 02:01:28.04
And showing the cops that there are blue washers because I'm bugging the house.

1967
02:01:28.04 --> 02:01:29.04
You know, stuff like that.

1968
02:01:29.04 --> 02:01:31.04
I would come home for Ford.

1969
02:01:31.04 --> 02:01:34.04
I remember doing this one trip for a 24th STS, you know,

1970
02:01:34.04 --> 02:01:36.04
CCT guys, bad ass dudes.

1971
02:01:36.04 --> 02:01:39.04
Four days training hours wiped out, man.

1972
02:01:39.04 --> 02:01:42.04
I was smoked and I was coming back from,

1973
02:01:42.04 --> 02:01:43.04
it was up by,

1974
02:01:43.04 --> 02:01:45.04
Moec.

1975
02:01:45.04 --> 02:01:46.04
Yeah.

1976
02:01:46.04 --> 02:01:47.04
Yep.

1977
02:01:47.04 --> 02:01:48.04
So for me, it was like a five hour drive.

1978
02:01:48.04 --> 02:01:51.04
And I am abacking my drive with the truck.

1979
02:01:51.04 --> 02:01:52.04
And I'm looking to review of your mirror.

1980
02:01:52.04 --> 02:01:54.04
And all my shit is in the driveway.

1981
02:01:54.04 --> 02:01:55.04
It's all in the driver.

1982
02:01:55.04 --> 02:01:57.04
And she's sitting on a stool.

1983
02:01:57.04 --> 02:01:59.04
She's going through like my tackle box.

1984
02:01:59.04 --> 02:02:00.04
You know, and all my tools.

1985
02:02:00.04 --> 02:02:01.04
And it's all just everything.

1986
02:02:01.04 --> 02:02:03.04
She's looking for clues or something.

1987
02:02:03.04 --> 02:02:06.04
You know, that was, that was the,

1988
02:02:06.04 --> 02:02:07.04
I remember that night.

1989
02:02:07.04 --> 02:02:09.04
That was the start of broken cameras back.

1990
02:02:09.04 --> 02:02:11.04
And she called the cops at night.

1991
02:02:11.04 --> 02:02:13.04
Cops came and they said, hey, can you stay somewhere else?

1992
02:02:13.04 --> 02:02:14.04
I go, yep.

1993
02:02:14.04 --> 02:02:15.04
Absolutely.

1994
02:02:15.04 --> 02:02:17.04
Because there's been a hotel that I've been going to.

1995
02:02:17.04 --> 02:02:18.04
Mm-hmm.

1996
02:02:18.04 --> 02:02:20.04
And it was just a mile down the road.

1997
02:02:20.04 --> 02:02:23.04
Uh, next day, one of the cops calls, calls me.

1998
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:25.04
And he says, um,

1999
02:02:25.04 --> 02:02:28.04
Can I talk to you?

2000
02:02:28.04 --> 02:02:29.04
Uh,

2001
02:02:29.04 --> 02:02:31.04
So I, I said, where yet, he said, I'm at your house.

2002
02:02:31.04 --> 02:02:32.04
I drive there.

2003
02:02:32.04 --> 02:02:34.04
He goes, hey, I ran into your wife in the village.

2004
02:02:34.04 --> 02:02:35.04
She's freaking dope.

2005
02:02:35.04 --> 02:02:36.04
I don't remind him.

2006
02:02:36.04 --> 02:02:37.04
He said, brother.

2007
02:02:37.04 --> 02:02:41.04
He knew, you know, who I was, where I came from.

2008
02:02:41.04 --> 02:02:42.04
It's stuff like that.

2009
02:02:42.04 --> 02:02:43.04
Very nice guy.

2010
02:02:43.04 --> 02:02:45.04
He goes, you need to take radical steps.

2011
02:02:45.04 --> 02:02:47.04
And you need to get the fuck out here.

2012
02:02:47.04 --> 02:02:48.04
I know you're in it for the kids.

2013
02:02:48.04 --> 02:02:52.04
Kids are resilient.

2014
02:02:52.04 --> 02:02:54.04
They will, and they will be able to handle us.

2015
02:02:54.04 --> 02:02:56.04
But you need to get the fuck out.

2016
02:02:56.04 --> 02:02:58.04
And I was, uh, man, I was broke down.

2017
02:02:58.04 --> 02:03:00.04
Because nobody at that until that,

2018
02:03:00.04 --> 02:03:02.04
nobody at that, nobody at that,

2019
02:03:02.04 --> 02:03:05.04
I, I, I, I felt that I was all alone in the world.

2020
02:03:05.04 --> 02:03:08.04
That I was going through this shit, you know, that nobody had any idea.

2021
02:03:08.04 --> 02:03:10.04
The cops had seen it, because they better than many times.

2022
02:03:10.04 --> 02:03:14.04
But, um, that night, I get jacked up again.

2023
02:03:14.04 --> 02:03:17.04
Uh, and I'm with my sweet son, uh,

2024
02:03:17.04 --> 02:03:21.04
James and, and I'm talking to him, and I remember telling him,

2025
02:03:21.04 --> 02:03:24.04
How will he, is he, is probably, let me see,

2026
02:03:24.04 --> 02:03:25.04
What, what, what, what, what, what,

2027
02:03:25.04 --> 02:03:30.04
So, uh, so, uh, he, uh, he's, uh, seven.

2028
02:03:30.04 --> 02:03:31.04
Okay.

2029
02:03:31.04 --> 02:03:34.04
And, um, he said, I say, James,

2030
02:03:34.04 --> 02:03:35.04
I don't just love you.

2031
02:03:35.04 --> 02:03:37.04
I am in love with you.

2032
02:03:37.04 --> 02:03:38.04
And he started crying.

2033
02:03:38.04 --> 02:03:39.04
He, that really meant something to him.

2034
02:03:39.04 --> 02:03:41.04
You know, he really meant something.

2035
02:03:41.04 --> 02:03:45.04
And then I realized, fuck man, this kid really digs me, you know,

2036
02:03:45.04 --> 02:03:47.04
Really freaking digs me.

2037
02:03:47.04 --> 02:03:50.04
So I, he falls asleep by take him to bed,

2038
02:03:50.04 --> 02:03:52.04
and I go back up into my bonus room.

2039
02:03:52.04 --> 02:03:56.04
And I realize that I need to make a change now.

2040
02:03:56.04 --> 02:03:58.04
This has to happen now.

2041
02:03:58.04 --> 02:04:00.04
So that whole that I was looking at,

2042
02:04:00.04 --> 02:04:02.04
that I was almost capitulated to, you know,

2043
02:04:02.04 --> 02:04:04.04
I'm, it the bottom of the whole.

2044
02:04:04.04 --> 02:04:08.04
It was like in a piffy-any where I,

2045
02:04:08.04 --> 02:04:11.04
I, I'm not letting this, this bitch bury me.

2046
02:04:11.04 --> 02:04:12.04
I will not be defeated.

2047
02:04:12.04 --> 02:04:13.04
I am not buried.

2048
02:04:13.04 --> 02:04:15.04
I have been planted.

2049
02:04:15.04 --> 02:04:18.04
You know, it was, it was just moment of clarity I had.

2050
02:04:18.04 --> 02:04:20.04
I put out my running shoes and, uh,

2051
02:04:20.04 --> 02:04:25.04
put my, um, my, my, I, I pod, I, yeah, I pod out my head, head,

2052
02:04:25.04 --> 02:04:28.04
phones, uh, put out some shorts and I said, all right,

2053
02:04:28.04 --> 02:04:29.04
settle on on clock.

2054
02:04:29.04 --> 02:04:30.04
I'm going to go for run tomorrow.

2055
02:04:30.04 --> 02:04:31.04
No plan.

2056
02:04:31.04 --> 02:04:33.04
Just let me go clear my head.

2057
02:04:33.04 --> 02:04:35.04
Got up full of piss and vinegar.

2058
02:04:35.04 --> 02:04:37.04
Put the shit on and I ran.

2059
02:04:37.04 --> 02:04:39.04
And I'm not a ground pounder.

2060
02:04:39.04 --> 02:04:40.04
I like the sprint.

2061
02:04:40.04 --> 02:04:41.04
I like running.

2062
02:04:41.04 --> 02:04:43.04
But I ran for about an hour and a half.

2063
02:04:43.04 --> 02:04:45.04
It's not stopped.

2064
02:04:45.04 --> 02:04:47.04
I just kept running around town, you know,

2065
02:04:47.04 --> 02:04:48.04
got back in my driveway.

2066
02:04:48.04 --> 02:04:50.04
I'm starving.

2067
02:04:50.04 --> 02:04:52.04
And I look at the house and I'm going,

2068
02:04:52.04 --> 02:04:55.04
this is the house where dreams go to die.

2069
02:04:55.04 --> 02:04:57.04
I don't want to go inside.

2070
02:04:57.04 --> 02:04:58.04
So I stay in my driveway.

2071
02:04:58.04 --> 02:05:00.04
I work out for like another two hours.

2072
02:05:00.04 --> 02:05:01.04
Just up and down.

2073
02:05:01.04 --> 02:05:03.04
I had some dumbbells and I put it more.

2074
02:05:03.04 --> 02:05:05.04
And I just work out for like another two hours.

2075
02:05:05.04 --> 02:05:08.04
I mean, to the point of like incapacitation.

2076
02:05:08.04 --> 02:05:10.04
Um, but that was it.

2077
02:05:10.04 --> 02:05:12.04
That was my, that was my rebirth thinking.

2078
02:05:12.04 --> 02:05:14.04
There's no way I'm going to be defeated by this.

2079
02:05:14.04 --> 02:05:15.04
There's no way.

2080
02:05:15.04 --> 02:05:17.04
And I am not buried.

2081
02:05:17.04 --> 02:05:19.04
I have been planted.

2082
02:05:19.04 --> 02:05:21.04
Uh, but that was the beginning of the whole.

2083
02:05:21.04 --> 02:05:23.04
And then with the cop coming the day before.

2084
02:05:23.04 --> 02:05:25.04
Hmm, it's a, get the fuck out.

2085
02:05:25.04 --> 02:05:27.04
So that day, I got the fuck out.

2086
02:05:27.04 --> 02:05:29.04
Um, grabbed your shit and left.

2087
02:05:29.04 --> 02:05:31.04
Yeah, it was just 500 yards away.

2088
02:05:31.04 --> 02:05:33.04
I found a, um, condo.

2089
02:05:33.04 --> 02:05:35.04
Because I didn't want to be far from my kiddies.

2090
02:05:35.04 --> 02:05:36.04
Yeah, for sure.

2091
02:05:36.04 --> 02:05:39.04
Um, so it's like 500 yards as a crow flies.

2092
02:05:39.04 --> 02:05:42.04
And just pick, you know, I didn't need things.

2093
02:05:42.04 --> 02:05:46.04
I needed my guns and some tools and that kind of stuff.

2094
02:05:46.04 --> 02:05:51.04
And uh, packed up what I, what I could and just freaking buggy.

2095
02:05:51.04 --> 02:05:57.04
Uh, yeah, and started that arduous process of domestic messiness

2096
02:05:57.04 --> 02:06:02.04
I lasted for a long time with me because I was trying to get custody too at the time.

2097
02:06:02.04 --> 02:06:07.04
And trying to do that in North Carolina is like pulling free and teeth.

2098
02:06:07.04 --> 02:06:13.04
Yeah, and they need, you need, um, they're got to a point where I was going.

2099
02:06:13.04 --> 02:06:16.04
The cops had go see the magistrate. I mean, magistrate.

2100
02:06:16.04 --> 02:06:18.04
I went to the magistrate.

2101
02:06:18.04 --> 02:06:20.04
I pleaded my case.

2102
02:06:20.04 --> 02:06:27.04
Magistrate says you need to call, um, mobile, uh, mobile, um, mobile crisis management.

2103
02:06:27.04 --> 02:06:30.04
Call mobile crisis management.

2104
02:06:30.04 --> 02:06:32.04
And they say you need to talk to her shrink.

2105
02:06:32.04 --> 02:06:34.04
I go to the shrink.

2106
02:06:34.04 --> 02:06:35.04
They won't talk to me.

2107
02:06:35.04 --> 02:06:36.04
They say go tell the police.

2108
02:06:36.04 --> 02:06:38.04
So it's sent me in a big circle.

2109
02:06:38.04 --> 02:06:45.04
So I finally talked mobile crisis management into, um, they said we're voluntary.

2110
02:06:45.04 --> 02:06:48.04
They have to voluntarily commit themselves as can you least talk to her.

2111
02:06:48.04 --> 02:06:54.04
So they talked to her. They came out said yes, um, paranoid and, uh, delusion.

2112
02:06:54.04 --> 02:06:56.04
No doubt.

2113
02:06:56.04 --> 02:07:05.04
I said so what does it take? She goes, there has to be basically in, in the state, something horrible

2114
02:07:05.04 --> 02:07:08.04
happens. Has to happen first.

2115
02:07:08.04 --> 02:07:10.04
Like, let me set the house on fire.

2116
02:07:10.04 --> 02:07:14.04
Let me drown the kid. That kind of thing. Then, okay.

2117
02:07:14.04 --> 02:07:16.04
Now it's okay.

2118
02:07:16.04 --> 02:07:19.04
You got, yeah, it's, I said, are you fucking shit me?

2119
02:07:19.04 --> 02:07:20.04
This is how it works.

2120
02:07:20.04 --> 02:07:21.04
I said, you're basic.

2121
02:07:21.04 --> 02:07:22.04
That's what those are my words.

2122
02:07:22.04 --> 02:07:25.04
I said, basically what you're telling me is something horrible happens.

2123
02:07:25.04 --> 02:07:28.04
That's, you know, that's exactly what I'm telling you.

2124
02:07:28.04 --> 02:07:29.04
Something horrible happened.

2125
02:07:29.04 --> 02:07:32.04
Has to happen first.

2126
02:07:32.04 --> 02:07:38.04
As you, as you look back at this, like from your perspective right now, because a lot of guys that, um,

2127
02:07:38.04 --> 02:07:41.04
a lot of veterans got a guy that have gotten out.

2128
02:07:41.04 --> 02:07:44.04
And a lot of guys, you know, they had, they were off time with it.

2129
02:07:44.04 --> 02:07:51.04
Is there, uh, advice straight up when, when a guy's looking at the abyss, when a guy's thinking everything sucks,

2130
02:07:51.04 --> 02:07:57.04
when a guy's thinking, they lost their job, their wife's acting crazy, whatever, all these things pile up,

2131
02:07:57.04 --> 02:08:03.04
is there advice that you have for guys that get in that situation? What I always tell people is like you need to find a new mission.

2132
02:08:03.04 --> 02:08:04.04
That's what you need to do.

2133
02:08:04.04 --> 02:08:10.04
That's exactly what I, I, either mission or I say purpose, um, or meaning.

2134
02:08:10.04 --> 02:08:14.04
So, um, meaning could be volunteering somewhere.

2135
02:08:14.04 --> 02:08:20.04
It could be going to the gym, you know, saying it's an awesome act.

2136
02:08:20.04 --> 02:08:22.04
But you have to have purpose in meaning.

2137
02:08:22.04 --> 02:08:24.04
You have to find those things.

2138
02:08:24.04 --> 02:08:29.04
So, one of the things, this is a funny, this, I, I volunteer every day.

2139
02:08:29.04 --> 02:08:32.04
I have five guys I train at my gym.

2140
02:08:32.04 --> 02:08:35.04
It's grottis, I do a volunteer voluntarily.

2141
02:08:35.04 --> 02:08:38.04
Um, but they're relying on me to show up.

2142
02:08:38.04 --> 02:08:40.04
You know, so it's a gift.

2143
02:08:40.04 --> 02:08:43.04
They always say thanks, bro, man, because I'm changing their lives.

2144
02:08:43.04 --> 02:08:45.04
These are, guys, I know they work in the community.

2145
02:08:45.04 --> 02:08:48.04
You know, it's my mechanic, my, uh, owner, my pub.

2146
02:08:48.04 --> 02:08:49.04
These kind of things.

2147
02:08:49.04 --> 02:08:53.04
Um, but, you know, I'm changing their lives, but the other thing, I tell them is,

2148
02:08:53.04 --> 02:08:56.04
bro, thank you because, you know, you're getting me here.

2149
02:08:56.04 --> 02:08:58.04
You're, you're getting me here.

2150
02:08:58.04 --> 02:09:02.04
You keep me on my, uh, programming and you're giving me purpose in meaning.

2151
02:09:02.04 --> 02:09:06.04
I'm still getting a probably freaking get some anyway, because that's who I am.

2152
02:09:06.04 --> 02:09:10.04
But, you know, you're keeping me on schedule, keeping me on track.

2153
02:09:10.04 --> 02:09:11.04
That kind of thing.

2154
02:09:11.04 --> 02:09:12.04
So, thank you.

2155
02:09:12.04 --> 02:09:16.04
Um, but yeah, you got to have, you know, new mission statement.

2156
02:09:16.04 --> 02:09:17.04
Purpose in meaning.

2157
02:09:17.04 --> 02:09:21.04
Got to have those things, especially guys who've been in for a long, freaking time.

2158
02:09:21.04 --> 02:09:27.04
Um, and sometimes it pisses me off because I'll have guys ask for advice and they'll say,

2159
02:09:27.04 --> 02:09:31.04
I'm in a dark spot, you know, I've been loving wife and kids who love me.

2160
02:09:31.04 --> 02:09:34.04
And I want to tell them, bro, fuck you.

2161
02:09:34.04 --> 02:09:40.04
You know what, um, because I had to do that shit without that, with hate, with disdain.

2162
02:09:40.04 --> 02:09:44.04
Um, and that's your reason right there, man.

2163
02:09:44.04 --> 02:09:45.04
That's your mission.

2164
02:09:45.04 --> 02:09:49.04
You got a wife of freaking digs a hell out of you and supports everything you do.

2165
02:09:49.04 --> 02:09:52.04
You know, that's your queen, bro.

2166
02:09:52.04 --> 02:09:54.04
Lay out the free and carpet.

2167
02:09:54.04 --> 02:09:58.04
Your mission is to make her coffee and cook for her, clean your house or whatever it is.

2168
02:09:58.04 --> 02:09:59.04
I don't know.

2169
02:09:59.04 --> 02:10:02.04
Make a lot of money so she's comfortable.

2170
02:10:02.04 --> 02:10:04.04
Yeah, I don't know.

2171
02:10:04.04 --> 02:10:14.04
And then what was it, uh, as your business grew, like what was some, what was some things that, that kind of accelerated your business?

2172
02:10:14.04 --> 02:10:22.04
Um, I think the big thing is, um, I don't, um, you know, all my eggs aren't in one basket.

2173
02:10:22.04 --> 02:10:23.04
That's a big one.

2174
02:10:23.04 --> 02:10:28.04
But because that business is good, but I've been hit before by, like, sequestration and stuff like that.

2175
02:10:28.04 --> 02:10:33.04
It could be a ammo crisis or whatever, because basically my business is, you know,

2176
02:10:33.04 --> 02:10:38.04
shooting combat marksmanship, close quarter battle, those kind of things.

2177
02:10:38.04 --> 02:10:40.04
Um, that works well.

2178
02:10:40.04 --> 02:10:45.04
That runs well because I have my own brand of training methodology and, you know,

2179
02:10:45.04 --> 02:10:46.04
can't be replicated.

2180
02:10:46.04 --> 02:10:48.04
We're all teaching basically the same thing.

2181
02:10:48.04 --> 02:10:50.04
It's just that, how do you deliver that?

2182
02:10:50.04 --> 02:10:53.04
You know, what is your delivery platform?

2183
02:10:53.04 --> 02:10:54.04
How do you relate?

2184
02:10:54.04 --> 02:10:56.04
Because that's what people are buying.

2185
02:10:56.04 --> 02:11:02.04
I mean, you could teach somebody to squeeze a trigger the same way I can, but how do you deliver that message?

2186
02:11:02.04 --> 02:11:08.04
And then, you know, what words do you use and, and, um, what demonstrations can you put together?

2187
02:11:08.04 --> 02:11:13.04
And how is this important, um, or why?

2188
02:11:13.04 --> 02:11:15.04
So, uh, that business goes good.

2189
02:11:15.04 --> 02:11:18.04
And then I just, I keep putting some jam and shit into the pipeline.

2190
02:11:18.04 --> 02:11:20.04
You know what I mean?

2191
02:11:20.04 --> 02:11:25.04
I still don't want to ban when opportunity knocks and like, yeah, I'm snatching that up.

2192
02:11:25.04 --> 02:11:26.04
I'm doing that.

2193
02:11:26.04 --> 02:11:27.04
I'm, yeah.

2194
02:11:27.04 --> 02:11:32.04
And it's been a double-ed sword because the last couple years I've got really smoked.

2195
02:11:32.04 --> 02:11:34.04
So this year I cut back on courses.

2196
02:11:34.04 --> 02:11:39.04
And I'm going to work more out of like home, do more mentoring and coaching,

2197
02:11:39.04 --> 02:11:43.04
look online stuff and, you know, some more product that kind of thing.

2198
02:11:43.04 --> 02:11:44.04
Hmm.

2199
02:11:44.04 --> 02:11:46.04
What kind of products you selling?

2200
02:11:46.04 --> 02:11:50.04
Well, you know, I get the bands that they get you some bands.

2201
02:11:50.04 --> 02:11:55.04
And those are, you know, everyone's well, get them in stock.

2202
02:11:55.04 --> 02:11:59.04
Um, and it's not something I have constant flow because I have to order them.

2203
02:11:59.04 --> 02:12:00.04
That would be made.

2204
02:12:00.04 --> 02:12:03.04
Uh, I've got a sling thing.

2205
02:12:03.04 --> 02:12:06.04
You know, that's for a, uh, it's kind of like a modular monopod.

2206
02:12:06.04 --> 02:12:07.04
I got books.

2207
02:12:07.04 --> 02:12:11.04
I got, uh, what kind of product do I have?

2208
02:12:11.04 --> 02:12:12.04
Not a lot.

2209
02:12:12.04 --> 02:12:15.04
Not, not, not, not, I have like a store, you know, teacher.

2210
02:12:15.04 --> 02:12:16.04
Yeah.

2211
02:12:16.04 --> 02:12:17.04
Yeah.

2212
02:12:17.04 --> 02:12:18.04
Okay, somebody wants to get you some.

2213
02:12:18.04 --> 02:12:19.04
Nope.

2214
02:12:19.04 --> 02:12:19.04
Yeah.

2215
02:12:19.04 --> 02:12:21.04
That's one of the teachers get you some.

2216
02:12:21.04 --> 02:12:22.04
That's one of them.

2217
02:12:22.04 --> 02:12:23.04
Get your blaze off.

2218
02:12:23.04 --> 02:12:24.04
Yeah.

2219
02:12:24.04 --> 02:12:24.04
Get your blaze off.

2220
02:12:24.04 --> 02:12:25.04
Get your blaze on.

2221
02:12:25.04 --> 02:12:26.04
And you do.

2222
02:12:26.04 --> 02:12:29.04
When you, uh, like I've seen some of your stuff where you've got like,

2223
02:12:29.04 --> 02:12:30.04
blaze ops.

2224
02:12:30.04 --> 02:12:31.04
Yeah.

2225
02:12:31.04 --> 02:12:32.04
45s.

2226
02:12:32.04 --> 02:12:33.04
Oh, right.

2227
02:12:33.04 --> 02:12:34.04
Yeah.

2228
02:12:34.04 --> 02:12:35.04
Are those like, um, available?

2229
02:12:35.04 --> 02:12:38.04
Uh, well, those, everyone's wanted you to collaborate.

2230
02:12:38.04 --> 02:12:39.04
Got it.

2231
02:12:39.04 --> 02:12:42.04
With a guy, you know, and so I did one with them.

2232
02:12:42.04 --> 02:12:44.04
Because I know someone that needs a blaze.

2233
02:12:44.04 --> 02:12:45.04
Yeah.

2234
02:12:45.04 --> 02:12:46.04
Yeah.

2235
02:12:46.04 --> 02:12:47.04
We don't have that.

2236
02:12:47.04 --> 02:12:48.04
That was our nearest 25.

2237
02:12:48.04 --> 02:12:49.04
Only 25 of those were made.

2238
02:12:49.04 --> 02:12:50.04
We got to do another run.

2239
02:12:50.04 --> 02:12:51.04
Yeah.

2240
02:12:51.04 --> 02:12:52.04
Yeah.

2241
02:12:52.04 --> 02:12:55.04
Well, I'm collaborating right now with another company to do a different one.

2242
02:12:55.04 --> 02:12:58.04
So it's, it's, it's very fledgling right now.

2243
02:12:58.04 --> 02:13:01.04
It's in, it's, it's, it's, it's, but, but I've done, uh, like,

2244
02:13:01.04 --> 02:13:09.04
a, like a, a knife, you know, a, a knife by one company, a done three different

2245
02:13:09.04 --> 02:13:13.04
guns, different gun companies working on another one right now.

2246
02:13:13.04 --> 02:13:17.04
It's just going to collab, you know, build partnerships with company for sure.

2247
02:13:17.04 --> 02:13:18.04
Yep.

2248
02:13:18.04 --> 02:13:20.04
Um, sometime they work well, sometime they do not.

2249
02:13:20.04 --> 02:13:21.04
Yeah.

2250
02:13:21.04 --> 02:13:26.04
They all got everybody out there is, uh, there's some, there's some slimy motherfuckers.

2251
02:13:26.04 --> 02:13:28.04
There isn't need.

2252
02:13:28.04 --> 02:13:29.04
Yeah.

2253
02:13:29.04 --> 02:13:33.04
Uh, I mean, look, dude, it's been, it's been over two hours.

2254
02:13:33.04 --> 02:13:34.04
Yep.

2255
02:13:34.04 --> 02:13:39.04
Uh, but so all the stuff that you're doing right now, you're getting after, you got, you got, um,

2256
02:13:39.04 --> 02:13:42.04
T-max, T-max, ink.com.

2257
02:13:42.04 --> 02:13:43.04
Yep.

2258
02:13:43.04 --> 02:13:46.04
That's where people go to hook up with your training, which I looked at your schedule.

2259
02:13:46.04 --> 02:13:47.04
You said you're not doing as much.

2260
02:13:47.04 --> 02:13:48.04
Yeah.

2261
02:13:48.04 --> 02:13:49.04
Bro, your calendars.

2262
02:13:49.04 --> 02:13:50.04
Yeah.

2263
02:13:50.04 --> 02:13:53.04
It's not much more than two courses a month though.

2264
02:13:53.04 --> 02:13:54.04
Yep.

2265
02:13:54.04 --> 02:13:55.04
For the, for the year.

2266
02:13:55.04 --> 02:13:56.04
But you do them in different locations.

2267
02:13:56.04 --> 02:13:57.04
Yes.

2268
02:13:57.04 --> 02:13:58.04
Yeah.

2269
02:13:58.04 --> 02:13:59.04
Yeah.

2270
02:13:59.04 --> 02:14:02.04
And what I was going to say was you're like, hey, look, you know, people can shoot.

2271
02:14:02.04 --> 02:14:06.04
And, and there's, you know, thousands and thousands of guys that are really good with pistol.

2272
02:14:06.04 --> 02:14:09.04
And then you kind of mentioned, but, you know, it's a methodology.

2273
02:14:09.04 --> 02:14:12.04
But also, look, I instruct you, man, I teach leadership all the time.

2274
02:14:12.04 --> 02:14:13.04
That's what I do.

2275
02:14:13.04 --> 02:14:15.04
And there's a bunch of people at teach leadership.

2276
02:14:15.04 --> 02:14:16.04
Yep.

2277
02:14:16.04 --> 02:14:21.04
There's, uh, there's a communication skill set that you have where what you can do is convey the message

2278
02:14:21.04 --> 02:14:23.04
properly that so people actually absorb it.

2279
02:14:23.04 --> 02:14:24.04
Right.

2280
02:14:24.04 --> 02:14:25.04
That's the important part.

2281
02:14:25.04 --> 02:14:28.04
You can say that, you know, the big thing about teaching is you have to be the right person.

2282
02:14:28.04 --> 02:14:29.04
It's going to say the right thing.

2283
02:14:29.04 --> 02:14:30.04
To the right person at the right time.

2284
02:14:30.04 --> 02:14:32.04
It's important to know what to say.

2285
02:14:32.04 --> 02:14:35.04
But more important to know what not to say.

2286
02:14:35.04 --> 02:14:37.04
And the message has to be palatable too.

2287
02:14:37.04 --> 02:14:42.04
And then, you know, has to resonate with, uh, resonate and be relevant.

2288
02:14:42.04 --> 02:14:44.04
But yeah, man, it's, I love doing that.

2289
02:14:44.04 --> 02:14:45.04
I love the teaching thing.

2290
02:14:45.04 --> 02:14:49.04
Um, and, and those courses are for everybody.

2291
02:14:49.04 --> 02:14:50.04
Yes.

2292
02:14:50.04 --> 02:14:51.04
Yeah.

2293
02:14:51.04 --> 02:14:52.04
I do open enrollment courses.

2294
02:14:52.04 --> 02:14:53.04
Yeah.

2295
02:14:53.04 --> 02:14:55.04
So I get the full gambit of people.

2296
02:14:55.04 --> 02:14:57.04
I think most of them are sold out this year.

2297
02:14:57.04 --> 02:14:59.04
I think the only one open.

2298
02:14:59.04 --> 02:15:01.04
I have a woman's course and a beginner's course.

2299
02:15:01.04 --> 02:15:03.04
I've never taught either.

2300
02:15:03.04 --> 02:15:03.04
Right.

2301
02:15:03.04 --> 02:15:05.04
Where's the beginner's course?

2302
02:15:05.04 --> 02:15:06.04
Because they're, Charles is signing up.

2303
02:15:06.04 --> 02:15:09.04
They're both, um, they're both in North Carolina.

2304
02:15:09.04 --> 02:15:11.04
Find the North Carolina, I go Charles.

2305
02:15:11.04 --> 02:15:11.04
Yep.

2306
02:15:11.04 --> 02:15:12.04
I'll bring my party mix.

2307
02:15:12.04 --> 02:15:13.04
Yeah.

2308
02:15:13.04 --> 02:15:14.04
Okay.

2309
02:15:14.04 --> 02:15:14.04
Thanks.

2310
02:15:14.04 --> 02:15:15.04
Yeah.

2311
02:15:15.04 --> 02:15:18.04
So we got, so we got Dmax, Inc.com.

2312
02:15:18.04 --> 02:15:19.04
Then you also have combat strengths.

2313
02:15:19.04 --> 02:15:20.04
Right.

2314
02:15:20.04 --> 02:15:20.04
Training.

2315
02:15:20.04 --> 02:15:23.04
Yeah.

2316
02:15:23.04 --> 02:15:24.04
Which is where.

2317
02:15:24.04 --> 02:15:30.04
And you got, look, I don't, one of the reasons I didn't talk a bunch about this is because you got awesome videos online.

2318
02:15:30.04 --> 02:15:31.04
You talk about what you're doing.

2319
02:15:31.04 --> 02:15:33.04
You show what you're doing.

2320
02:15:33.04 --> 02:15:34.04
Right.

2321
02:15:34.04 --> 02:15:35.04
Um, you got those courses.

2322
02:15:35.04 --> 02:15:39.04
Clearly you're based on and I hate to use the word functional.

2323
02:15:39.04 --> 02:15:40.04
Right.

2324
02:15:40.04 --> 02:15:41.04
Because everyone's been over on this.

2325
02:15:41.04 --> 02:15:45.04
But if going look at your, your stuff, what you're doing.

2326
02:15:45.04 --> 02:15:46.04
You can see clearly.

2327
02:15:46.04 --> 02:15:49.04
These are drills, skills, conditioning.

2328
02:15:49.04 --> 02:15:53.04
And based on being able to function in a wide variety of environments.

2329
02:15:53.04 --> 02:15:54.04
Critical situations.

2330
02:15:54.04 --> 02:15:55.04
Yeah.

2331
02:15:55.04 --> 02:15:58.04
The functional thing is overused and abused.

2332
02:15:58.04 --> 02:16:01.04
Uh, I say it's exercise for the real world.

2333
02:16:01.04 --> 02:16:02.04
Yeah.

2334
02:16:02.04 --> 02:16:05.04
I think that what we do or what I put together.

2335
02:16:05.04 --> 02:16:09.04
It's all about um, life saving or ask kicking.

2336
02:16:09.04 --> 02:16:11.04
You know, those are essentially it.

2337
02:16:11.04 --> 02:16:13.04
And I put a lot of free information out there on my, uh,

2338
02:16:13.04 --> 02:16:15.04
InstaShiz, um, Instagram.

2339
02:16:15.04 --> 02:16:16.04
Yeah.

2340
02:16:16.04 --> 02:16:17.04
Um, you know, yeah.

2341
02:16:17.04 --> 02:16:18.04
Yeah.

2342
02:16:18.04 --> 02:16:19.04
So that T max Inc.

2343
02:16:19.04 --> 02:16:20.04
Yeah.

2344
02:16:20.04 --> 02:16:21.04
Insta.

2345
02:16:21.04 --> 02:16:25.04
And the workout stuff that I put on there, it's not about hubris or gloating.

2346
02:16:25.04 --> 02:16:30.04
It's, it's about hey, this is a power day example because guys will buy my programming.

2347
02:16:30.04 --> 02:16:37.04
And if they run out of, uh, curriculum, uh, or ideas, they could just go back and say,

2348
02:16:37.04 --> 02:16:38.04
Are I power day strength?

2349
02:16:38.04 --> 02:16:39.04
They speed and quickness.

2350
02:16:39.04 --> 02:16:40.04
Sorry.

2351
02:16:40.04 --> 02:16:41.04
Yeah.

2352
02:16:41.04 --> 02:16:42.04
Those are good ideas.

2353
02:16:42.04 --> 02:16:43.04
Uh, yeah.

2354
02:16:43.04 --> 02:16:45.04
So, and it's, it's a great freaking platform.

2355
02:16:45.04 --> 02:16:47.04
And that's what I use it for information.

2356
02:16:47.04 --> 02:16:48.04
Yep.

2357
02:16:48.04 --> 02:16:50.04
So those are the two, uh, T max Inc.com.

2358
02:16:50.04 --> 02:16:52.04
You've got combat strength training.

2359
02:16:52.04 --> 02:16:53.04
You got come.

2360
02:16:53.04 --> 02:16:54.04
You got a Facebook which is T max Inc.

2361
02:16:54.04 --> 02:16:56.04
You've got your Instagram.

2362
02:16:56.04 --> 02:16:57.04
Yep.

2363
02:16:57.04 --> 02:16:58.04
Would you say InstaShiz?

2364
02:16:58.04 --> 02:16:59.04
InstaShiz?

2365
02:16:59.04 --> 02:17:01.04
No, but Loady, homie.

2366
02:17:01.04 --> 02:17:03.04
Uh, he calls it the gram.

2367
02:17:03.04 --> 02:17:05.04
I don't even call it that.

2368
02:17:05.04 --> 02:17:07.04
Capital, capital, capital, capital, G.

2369
02:17:07.04 --> 02:17:08.04
The gram.

2370
02:17:08.04 --> 02:17:09.04
Yeah.

2371
02:17:09.04 --> 02:17:12.04
And yours, uh, you, you, you all kinds of the other thing you do.

2372
02:17:12.04 --> 02:17:14.04
You talk about theirs, which is, which is awesome.

2373
02:17:14.04 --> 02:17:18.04
You give people a little heads up on, you know, you are your own protection.

2374
02:17:18.04 --> 02:17:19.04
Yes.

2375
02:17:19.04 --> 02:17:20.04
Yeah.

2376
02:17:20.04 --> 02:17:22.04
So, Sunday, Sentinel, Sermons.

2377
02:17:22.04 --> 02:17:23.04
Yep.

2378
02:17:23.04 --> 02:17:25.04
So teaching people, hey man, there's just things to think about.

2379
02:17:25.04 --> 02:17:26.04
Yep.

2380
02:17:26.04 --> 02:17:27.04
And everybody could use those things.

2381
02:17:27.04 --> 02:17:28.04
Right.

2382
02:17:28.04 --> 02:17:31.04
Because the world is not a happy, peaceful place all the time.

2383
02:17:31.04 --> 02:17:32.04
Right.

2384
02:17:32.04 --> 02:17:33.04
Yep.

2385
02:17:33.04 --> 02:17:34.04
And it's really easy to lose track of those.

2386
02:17:34.04 --> 02:17:35.04
Uh, echo.

2387
02:17:35.04 --> 02:17:36.04
You got anything?

2388
02:17:36.04 --> 02:17:37.04
And I got out.

2389
02:17:37.04 --> 02:17:38.04
You, my YouTube channel too.

2390
02:17:38.04 --> 02:17:39.04
Pat Mac, YouTube channel.

2391
02:17:39.04 --> 02:17:40.04
Oh yeah.

2392
02:17:40.04 --> 02:17:42.04
And those are great shooting drills.

2393
02:17:42.04 --> 02:17:43.04
You got everything on the side.

2394
02:17:43.04 --> 02:17:44.04
Oh, I got it.

2395
02:17:44.04 --> 02:17:45.04
It pisses me off every time I see it.

2396
02:17:45.04 --> 02:17:49.04
Because I know you're like, either at your gym, at your house, at your range.

2397
02:17:49.04 --> 02:17:52.04
And I live, of course, living California in a city.

2398
02:17:52.04 --> 02:17:53.04
Yes.

2399
02:17:53.04 --> 02:17:57.76
So, you can only, you know, luckily I get to shoot my bow, but I'm not cracking off rounds out

2400
02:17:57.76 --> 02:17:58.76
my back door.

2401
02:17:58.76 --> 02:17:59.76
I can promise you that.

2402
02:17:59.76 --> 02:18:03.40
So every time I see you climbing a faster, but cracking off rounds, I get so pissed

2403
02:18:03.40 --> 02:18:05.40
of like, well, I'm moving to North Carolina.

2404
02:18:05.40 --> 02:18:06.40
Yeah.

2405
02:18:06.40 --> 02:18:07.40
Come on.

2406
02:18:07.40 --> 02:18:08.40
Free America.

2407
02:18:08.40 --> 02:18:09.40
We got to go.

2408
02:18:09.40 --> 02:18:10.40
Well, you're bicep.

2409
02:18:10.40 --> 02:18:12.40
Like, what, what's the status on this?

2410
02:18:12.40 --> 02:18:18.28
I mean, you know, like, if you were to look at me, armed arm comparison, one small

2411
02:18:18.28 --> 02:18:21.12
or the other, and there's a big skull on, you know.

2412
02:18:21.12 --> 02:18:23.44
Well, you said it tore on them on the muscle.

2413
02:18:23.44 --> 02:18:24.44
So, did you have surgery?

2414
02:18:24.44 --> 02:18:25.44
Yes.

2415
02:18:25.44 --> 02:18:26.44
They did.

2416
02:18:26.44 --> 02:18:27.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2417
02:18:27.44 --> 02:18:29.44
It was very freaking meatball surgery.

2418
02:18:29.44 --> 02:18:30.44
Oh, army base.

2419
02:18:30.44 --> 02:18:31.44
Yes.

2420
02:18:31.44 --> 02:18:32.44
You were 18, you know, private.

2421
02:18:32.44 --> 02:18:34.44
They gave that to like a new guy doctor.

2422
02:18:34.44 --> 02:18:36.44
They're like, I want for you.

2423
02:18:36.44 --> 02:18:37.44
Yeah.

2424
02:18:37.44 --> 02:18:38.44
I mean, the skull is my heart.

2425
02:18:38.44 --> 02:18:39.44
I mean, it's all keyloid.

2426
02:18:39.44 --> 02:18:40.44
It's like that.

2427
02:18:40.44 --> 02:18:41.44
Why, you know.

2428
02:18:41.44 --> 02:18:43.88
And yeah, it's yeah.

2429
02:18:43.88 --> 02:18:47.76
But it's five or four volts of his E-tor, each of his bones.

2430
02:18:47.76 --> 02:18:48.76
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2431
02:18:48.76 --> 02:18:49.76
That's what you have operated on?

2432
02:18:49.76 --> 02:18:50.76
Yeah, yeah.

2433
02:18:50.76 --> 02:18:51.76
The tendon, the tendon.

2434
02:18:51.76 --> 02:18:52.76
Yeah, that's different.

2435
02:18:52.76 --> 02:18:53.76
Yeah.

2436
02:18:53.76 --> 02:18:54.76
Yeah.

2437
02:18:54.76 --> 02:18:55.76
But it works though.

2438
02:18:55.76 --> 02:18:56.76
Yeah, yeah.

2439
02:18:56.76 --> 02:18:57.76
Oh, yeah.

2440
02:18:57.76 --> 02:18:59.68
All my surgeries, because I've had a bunch of them.

2441
02:18:59.68 --> 02:19:00.76
There are everything's good, man.

2442
02:19:00.76 --> 02:19:02.92
I'm feeling pretty good.

2443
02:19:02.92 --> 02:19:06.16
But I attribute that to how I train.

2444
02:19:06.16 --> 02:19:07.60
And I take care of myself.

2445
02:19:07.60 --> 02:19:13.80
So I work out pretty freaking smart, a little more tentative now, because I'm 55

2446
02:19:13.80 --> 02:19:15.44
freaking years old.

2447
02:19:15.44 --> 02:19:21.80
So, you know, a little more tentative when it comes to like mixing up, grappling, freaking,

2448
02:19:21.80 --> 02:19:23.84
you know, that kind of thing.

2449
02:19:23.84 --> 02:19:26.72
I don't need to get jacked up while I'm training.

2450
02:19:26.72 --> 02:19:29.24
It's called fitness, not brokenness.

2451
02:19:29.24 --> 02:19:34.44
I got my own, the other thing is I got my own podcast.

2452
02:19:34.44 --> 02:19:36.12
Right on, and university a badass.

2453
02:19:36.12 --> 02:19:37.12
That's right.

2454
02:19:37.12 --> 02:19:39.96
So, I'm going to go with CJ and watch CJ's deal.

2455
02:19:39.96 --> 02:19:41.36
He's the metal motivator.

2456
02:19:41.36 --> 02:19:43.36
So he used to be a preacher.

2457
02:19:43.36 --> 02:19:44.36
Yeah.

2458
02:19:44.36 --> 02:19:47.64
So we've got a pretty good, good dynamic, because he's got a gift for Toribro.

2459
02:19:47.64 --> 02:19:51.12
I mean, I got jacked his jaws.

2460
02:19:51.12 --> 02:19:53.88
And he makes were legit cool too.

2461
02:19:53.88 --> 02:19:55.12
But he's like a metal head, right?

2462
02:19:55.12 --> 02:19:56.12
Yeah, yeah.

2463
02:19:56.12 --> 02:19:58.88
His monochron line is the metal motivator.

2464
02:19:58.88 --> 02:20:00.88
Right on, right on, it's funny, it's happening.

2465
02:20:00.88 --> 02:20:03.12
We have, you guys put out that podcast.

2466
02:20:03.12 --> 02:20:04.12
Not often enough.

2467
02:20:04.12 --> 02:20:08.16
Like once, month and a half, something like that.

2468
02:20:08.16 --> 02:20:09.16
Yeah.

2469
02:20:09.16 --> 02:20:10.16
But it's fun.

2470
02:20:10.16 --> 02:20:11.16
It's all upbeat.

2471
02:20:11.16 --> 02:20:12.16
Yeah.

2472
02:20:12.16 --> 02:20:14.16
Positive messaging and stuff like that.

2473
02:20:14.16 --> 02:20:15.16
Right on, man.

2474
02:20:15.16 --> 02:20:16.16
Right on, anything else.

2475
02:20:16.16 --> 02:20:17.16
What?

2476
02:20:17.16 --> 02:20:18.16
Do we miss anything?

2477
02:20:18.16 --> 02:20:19.16
No, bro.

2478
02:20:19.16 --> 02:20:22.68
I just really, I appreciate the opportunity to be sitting here with you.

2479
02:20:22.68 --> 02:20:27.08
And like I said, man, the inner web is a cool place if you use it right.

2480
02:20:27.08 --> 02:20:32.68
You know, if you use that thing right, it's a great platform that can help others.

2481
02:20:32.68 --> 02:20:35.76
And then I get to meet guys like you.

2482
02:20:35.76 --> 02:20:39.68
And you think it's like, do you not ready for you to know you because you know it?

2483
02:20:39.68 --> 02:20:41.68
It's the same feeling I get every time.

2484
02:20:41.68 --> 02:20:42.68
Right on, yeah.

2485
02:20:42.68 --> 02:20:43.68
Right on, yeah.

2486
02:20:43.68 --> 02:20:45.68
Well, hey, man, thanks for coming on.

2487
02:20:45.68 --> 02:20:47.68
Glad you came out the California right up.

2488
02:20:47.68 --> 02:20:51.68
You know, thanks for your 22 years on the grind.

2489
02:20:51.68 --> 02:20:52.68
Cool.

2490
02:20:52.68 --> 02:20:58.36
You know, taking that, taking us as a nation from the Cold War to the war on terror.

2491
02:20:58.36 --> 02:21:03.000
And for, wasn't for guys like you that kept those skills up during all that time that we

2492
02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.08
wouldn't have been ready for, you know, what we faced on the battlefield.

2493
02:21:06.08 --> 02:21:08.08
So thanks for your service, brother.

2494
02:21:08.08 --> 02:21:09.08
I can roll.

2495
02:21:09.08 --> 02:21:10.08
That's what I'm talking about.

2496
02:21:10.08 --> 02:21:11.08
Thank you, sir.

2497
02:21:11.08 --> 02:21:13.08
Right on.

2498
02:21:13.08 --> 02:21:20.08
And with that, Pat Mack has left the building.

2499
02:21:20.08 --> 02:21:28.32
And we are here should be, hopefully, let's just say, enthusiastic about improving

2500
02:21:28.32 --> 02:21:30.76
our skill sets in life.

2501
02:21:30.76 --> 02:21:31.76
Agreed.

2502
02:21:31.76 --> 02:21:32.76
In all aspects.

2503
02:21:32.76 --> 02:21:33.76
Yes.

2504
02:21:33.76 --> 02:21:38.40
Sometimes it might be hard to figure out of all these skill sets.

2505
02:21:38.40 --> 02:21:39.72
Where am I going to put my focus?

2506
02:21:39.72 --> 02:21:46.40
How do I prioritize and execute selecting proper skill sets to improve on?

2507
02:21:46.40 --> 02:21:47.64
What do you recommend, echo Charles?

2508
02:21:47.64 --> 02:21:50.56
Well, I recommend you get to have this.

2509
02:21:50.56 --> 02:21:51.56
But interestingly, right?

2510
02:21:51.56 --> 02:21:57.84
So Pat Mack, he's over here jumping at all, up pertaining these to improve his skill sets.

2511
02:21:57.84 --> 02:21:59.72
Are you training scenario?

2512
02:21:59.72 --> 02:22:04.88
He was offered jump done at the end when you wind up with a lot of skill sets.

2513
02:22:04.88 --> 02:22:05.88
Yep.

2514
02:22:05.88 --> 02:22:08.40
So many skill sets that you kind of forget you have.

2515
02:22:08.40 --> 02:22:12.60
So the moment comes and you're like, oh, you know, I can do that.

2516
02:22:12.60 --> 02:22:13.60
Right, did that.

2517
02:22:13.60 --> 02:22:14.60
Yeah, true.

2518
02:22:14.60 --> 02:22:20.56
So don't let get what skill sets you have until it's time to disarm a Bulgarian

2519
02:22:20.56 --> 02:22:21.56
land mind you.

2520
02:22:21.56 --> 02:22:23.20
I want to go school for that.

2521
02:22:23.20 --> 02:22:24.20
Pat Mack.

2522
02:22:24.20 --> 02:22:26.20
Come on in, all right.

2523
02:22:26.20 --> 02:22:28.96
So don't let you get to not be one of those skills.

2524
02:22:28.96 --> 02:22:29.96
Yes.

2525
02:22:29.96 --> 02:22:36.96
You know, we didn't even talk about the fighting skills with Pat Mack for some reason.

2526
02:22:36.96 --> 02:22:37.96
Yeah.

2527
02:22:37.96 --> 02:22:39.88
Because he's, you know, he does stand up.

2528
02:22:39.88 --> 02:22:41.88
He does the jitsu.

2529
02:22:41.88 --> 02:22:46.28
His jim is primarily an MMA jim, actually.

2530
02:22:46.28 --> 02:22:53.000
So anyways, we including Pat Mack agree.

2531
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:57.24
What is one skill set that you can utilize just about everywhere?

2532
02:22:57.24 --> 02:22:58.24
The jitsu.

2533
02:22:58.24 --> 02:22:59.24
It's true.

2534
02:22:59.24 --> 02:23:03.20
So, when we train jitsu, we need the jitsu to get if we're doing ghee, which we recommend

2535
02:23:03.20 --> 02:23:04.20
doing ghee.

2536
02:23:04.20 --> 02:23:06.28
So we are, in fact, doing ghee.

2537
02:23:06.28 --> 02:23:08.48
So get an origin ghee.

2538
02:23:08.48 --> 02:23:09.48
That's the answer.

2539
02:23:09.48 --> 02:23:11.96
Best ghee factually in the world.

2540
02:23:11.96 --> 02:23:14.36
Many options.

2541
02:23:14.36 --> 02:23:16.52
Quality arguably luxury.

2542
02:23:16.52 --> 02:23:17.52
Arguably.

2543
02:23:17.52 --> 02:23:21.76
Oh, is that kind of a, is that a problem for me?

2544
02:23:21.76 --> 02:23:22.76
I don't know.

2545
02:23:22.76 --> 02:23:27.40
When I put on my rift ghee and my kind of, you're in the Laplacerie.

2546
02:23:27.40 --> 02:23:28.40
For sure.

2547
02:23:28.40 --> 02:23:30.48
It does feel like we were putting on a rift ghee.

2548
02:23:30.48 --> 02:23:32.48
Very luxurious, yes sir.

2549
02:23:32.48 --> 02:23:35.28
Nonetheless, it's functional as well.

2550
02:23:35.28 --> 02:23:40.40
More importantly, and just so happens to be made in America.

2551
02:23:40.40 --> 02:23:41.88
That's not just so happens.

2552
02:23:41.88 --> 02:23:50.56
It's made in America through the determination, the determination of the people of America.

2553
02:23:50.56 --> 02:23:53.40
It's not on purpose.

2554
02:23:53.40 --> 02:23:55.000
It's not happen, since straight up on purpose.

2555
02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.24
There was people that said it couldn't be done, by the way.

2556
02:23:58.24 --> 02:24:02.000
Pete Roberts told all those people really.

2557
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Yeah, yeah.

2558
02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
What was this?

2559
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:09.40
It's cool to make ghee in America.

2560
02:24:09.40 --> 02:24:13.12
Unfortunately, it's not cool that you can't wear your ghee all the time.

2561
02:24:13.12 --> 02:24:16.12
Yeah, so, you know, I guess that's not.

2562
02:24:16.12 --> 02:24:17.12
Right?

2563
02:24:17.12 --> 02:24:18.12
That's not cool.

2564
02:24:18.12 --> 02:24:19.12
I mean, you, I guess you will.

2565
02:24:19.12 --> 02:24:24.64
Good wear your ghee all the time, but you might get some funny looks at the supermarket.

2566
02:24:24.64 --> 02:24:30.04
So if you ever worn your ghee outside the gym, they himnazium.

2567
02:24:30.04 --> 02:24:38.12
Yeah, so one time actually made, no one time, where I was up later than my lovely wife.

2568
02:24:38.12 --> 02:24:42.000
I didn't want to go in the room and like disturb her maybe waker up or something like that.

2569
02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.64
To go get a jack, it was kind of cold.

2570
02:24:43.64 --> 02:24:45.000
So I want to put it on.

2571
02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.64
I was wondering how you got a ghee on.

2572
02:24:48.64 --> 02:24:50.12
I needed a jacket scenario.

2573
02:24:50.12 --> 02:24:52.32
It's going on, but I didn't want to disturb.

2574
02:24:52.32 --> 02:24:54.84
So I'm like looking around for just, I don't know anything.

2575
02:24:54.84 --> 02:24:57.16
I didn't want to put a blanket on myself on the computer.

2576
02:24:57.16 --> 02:24:58.52
It seemed kind of, I don't know.

2577
02:24:58.52 --> 02:25:02.000
I mean, I guess I could have, but it kind of is not functional.

2578
02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.16
You know, you don't get in the way when you're typing and you got to read you.

2579
02:25:04.16 --> 02:25:07.000
Anyway, I find the riff ghee.

2580
02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.80
I put it on it worked.

2581
02:25:08.80 --> 02:25:09.80
Seems like.

2582
02:25:09.80 --> 02:25:10.80
Yeah.

2583
02:25:10.80 --> 02:25:16.96
So that there, there, I was there sitting there wearing my ghee top outside of the gym.

2584
02:25:16.96 --> 02:25:19.80
And what we wearing, we wearing pants joggers?

2585
02:25:19.80 --> 02:25:22.000
No, no, I don't.

2586
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Short.

2587
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.000
I probably was not wearing shorts if it was cold, but.

2588
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Good point.

2589
02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.000
It's not a good point for me, because I wear shorts when it's cold all the time.

2590
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.80
Yeah, but your legs don't get cold.

2591
02:25:31.80 --> 02:25:32.80
That is fake.

2592
02:25:32.80 --> 02:25:33.80
You know, your legs.

2593
02:25:33.80 --> 02:25:34.80
Yeah, I don't know.

2594
02:25:34.80 --> 02:25:38.40
I don't, I don't remember, but I think it was pants of some sort.

2595
02:25:38.40 --> 02:25:39.40
All right.

2596
02:25:39.40 --> 02:25:41.48
Nonetheless, yes, we're getting origin ghee.

2597
02:25:41.48 --> 02:25:42.48
Yes.

2598
02:25:42.48 --> 02:25:45.68
And because you can't wear a ghee, unless your echo Charles in your house don't want

2599
02:25:45.68 --> 02:25:46.68
to wake up your wife.

2600
02:25:46.68 --> 02:25:49.84
Most of the time, you don't want to wear a ghee around.

2601
02:25:49.84 --> 02:25:52.04
If you need pants, guess what?

2602
02:25:52.04 --> 02:26:01.44
You can get jeans, origin jeans, origin jeans, which are also made 100% in America.

2603
02:26:01.44 --> 02:26:09.04
And we just released the second version of the jeans, which are the first version, was called

2604
02:26:09.04 --> 02:26:10.36
the factory jeans.

2605
02:26:10.36 --> 02:26:12.76
They're a heavy weight, heavy error weight.

2606
02:26:12.76 --> 02:26:15.60
I guess technically they'd be a medium weight.

2607
02:26:15.60 --> 02:26:24.56
But we have now launched the Delta 68 jeans, which are lightweight.

2608
02:26:24.56 --> 02:26:26.84
People ask, are they, what is the word, flexible?

2609
02:26:26.84 --> 02:26:27.84
Is that the word?

2610
02:26:27.84 --> 02:26:29.68
Yeah, stretch, stretch, stretch.

2611
02:26:29.68 --> 02:26:31.68
Yes, they are.

2612
02:26:31.68 --> 02:26:34.92
There's, there, they're made to move.

2613
02:26:34.92 --> 02:26:39.12
You can do a full deep squat workout in your jeans.

2614
02:26:39.12 --> 02:26:40.52
They're not jaggings though.

2615
02:26:40.52 --> 02:26:43.12
You know, jaggings are no.

2616
02:26:43.12 --> 02:26:45.84
They're leggings, but jeans.

2617
02:26:45.84 --> 02:26:49.20
Oh, no, no, no, they just look like jeans, but they're leggings.

2618
02:26:49.20 --> 02:26:50.20
Oh.

2619
02:26:50.20 --> 02:26:51.64
So they're not jaggings.

2620
02:26:51.64 --> 02:26:55.28
They're kind of a violation of humanity with that.

2621
02:26:55.28 --> 02:26:58.04
Hey, you're the one who said the stretch, you said the word stretch.

2622
02:26:58.04 --> 02:26:59.04
Not me, you.

2623
02:26:59.04 --> 02:27:04.08
So, unless we got a clarify, so Delta 68 jeans have some give in them.

2624
02:27:04.08 --> 02:27:05.08
Let's just sit at them.

2625
02:27:05.08 --> 02:27:06.08
Have some give in them.

2626
02:27:06.08 --> 02:27:07.08
They allow you to.

2627
02:27:07.08 --> 02:27:08.08
They allow you to.

2628
02:27:08.08 --> 02:27:09.08
Some freedom of movement.

2629
02:27:09.08 --> 02:27:10.88
You're in a high kick or something like this.

2630
02:27:10.88 --> 02:27:11.88
Fine.

2631
02:27:11.88 --> 02:27:12.88
You're good.

2632
02:27:12.88 --> 02:27:13.88
There you go.

2633
02:27:13.88 --> 02:27:16.88
Delta 68 jeans are in the house.

2634
02:27:16.88 --> 02:27:17.88
There's it.

2635
02:27:17.88 --> 02:27:20.12
We're also joggers.

2636
02:27:20.12 --> 02:27:21.12
Comfortable joggers.

2637
02:27:21.12 --> 02:27:22.60
For people that wear joggers.

2638
02:27:22.60 --> 02:27:26.60
In the event of you wearing joggers, boom, origin, main.com.

2639
02:27:26.60 --> 02:27:30.24
That's where you get this stuff also supplements.

2640
02:27:30.24 --> 02:27:33.52
Jocco are supplements important.

2641
02:27:33.52 --> 02:27:34.92
They are important.

2642
02:27:34.92 --> 02:27:37.28
I'm not to split it.

2643
02:27:37.28 --> 02:27:43.12
And I think it puts too sharp of a point on it.

2644
02:27:43.12 --> 02:27:45.64
But it depends what kind of supplements.

2645
02:27:45.64 --> 02:27:46.64
True.

2646
02:27:46.64 --> 02:27:47.64
True.

2647
02:27:47.64 --> 02:27:53.04
I recommend that you put supplements that allow you to get after it at the top of your list.

2648
02:27:53.04 --> 02:27:54.04
I.

2649
02:27:54.04 --> 02:27:54.04
I.

2650
02:27:54.04 --> 02:27:55.04
Joint warfare.

2651
02:27:55.04 --> 02:27:56.04
Yes, sir.

2652
02:27:56.04 --> 02:27:57.04
I.

2653
02:27:57.04 --> 02:27:58.04
I.

2654
02:27:58.04 --> 02:27:59.04
Criolloial.

2655
02:27:59.04 --> 02:28:00.04
Super grill.

2656
02:28:00.04 --> 02:28:01.04
Super grill.

2657
02:28:01.04 --> 02:28:05.04
Keep your joints in the game.

2658
02:28:05.04 --> 02:28:07.08
If your joints aren't in the game, you're not in the game.

2659
02:28:07.08 --> 02:28:08.08
Straight up.

2660
02:28:08.08 --> 02:28:14.40
You know, discipline, discipline go, discipline go, pills, discipline go in a can.

2661
02:28:14.40 --> 02:28:16.72
You're going to need more protein.

2662
02:28:16.72 --> 02:28:17.72
Guess what?

2663
02:28:17.72 --> 02:28:20.76
You might as well get a protein that tastes like dessert.

2664
02:28:20.76 --> 02:28:22.44
You don't have to punish yourself with protein.

2665
02:28:22.44 --> 02:28:23.44
Remember those days?

2666
02:28:23.44 --> 02:28:24.44
Back.

2667
02:28:24.44 --> 02:28:25.44
Pockering the treat.

2668
02:28:25.44 --> 02:28:28.16
If you want to actually protein, it was a punishment.

2669
02:28:28.16 --> 02:28:29.16
It was a punishment.

2670
02:28:29.16 --> 02:28:30.16
Yeah.

2671
02:28:30.16 --> 02:28:31.16
If you wanted the good one.

2672
02:28:31.16 --> 02:28:34.000
Like you could get the, you know how like mega male mass.

2673
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Five thousand.

2674
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I don't know if you ever had this one.

2675
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000
I want to eat a big.

2676
02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000
A big.

2677
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
A big five thousand.

2678
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Yeah, it's in a big like.

2679
02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.000
A huge thing.

2680
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.000
But taste is pretty good.

2681
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
But I'm fairly searching.

2682
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.16
There is like straight up sugar and all this stuff.

2683
02:28:46.16 --> 02:28:49.44
And maybe like technically I might add some protein in there.

2684
02:28:49.44 --> 02:28:51.92
But it was like 5,000 calories or something like this.

2685
02:28:51.92 --> 02:28:54.16
Yeah, it was just you seem to say.

2686
02:28:54.16 --> 02:28:55.72
So milk.

2687
02:28:55.72 --> 02:28:57.72
You don't need to drink that junk anymore.

2688
02:28:57.72 --> 02:28:58.92
Now you can drink milk.

2689
02:28:58.92 --> 02:29:00.56
Mint strawberry.

2690
02:29:00.56 --> 02:29:02.56
Mint strawberry.

2691
02:29:02.56 --> 02:29:03.56
Vanilla.

2692
02:29:03.56 --> 02:29:04.56
Chocolate.

2693
02:29:04.56 --> 02:29:05.56
And peanut butter.

2694
02:29:05.56 --> 02:29:06.56
Yeah.

2695
02:29:06.56 --> 02:29:07.56
Good stuff.

2696
02:29:07.56 --> 02:29:12.24
You know, Dan who also got warrior kid milk.

2697
02:29:12.24 --> 02:29:13.80
You can hook that up for your children.

2698
02:29:13.80 --> 02:29:16.56
Why would you give your children poison?

2699
02:29:16.56 --> 02:29:18.56
No, he's giving milk.

2700
02:29:18.56 --> 02:29:22.000
I'll tell you the reason, man.

2701
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.80
Short term versus long term.

2702
02:29:23.80 --> 02:29:24.80
Everything.

2703
02:29:24.80 --> 02:29:26.52
Everything you need broken down short term versus long term.

2704
02:29:26.52 --> 02:29:30.40
So you can even kids poison as it were.

2705
02:29:30.40 --> 02:29:39.92
Or these supremely unhealthy items for short term gain to keep them quiet, to keep them

2706
02:29:39.92 --> 02:29:43.88
from complaining, to put a temporary smile on their face.

2707
02:29:43.88 --> 02:29:44.88
You know why you do it?

2708
02:29:44.88 --> 02:29:45.88
I don't even think that's the case, man.

2709
02:29:45.88 --> 02:29:47.52
I just think you don't know.

2710
02:29:47.52 --> 02:29:48.88
You just don't know.

2711
02:29:48.88 --> 02:29:49.88
Now yes, you're right.

2712
02:29:49.88 --> 02:29:50.88
You go, okay.

2713
02:29:50.88 --> 02:29:55.24
Hey, I got this strawberry drink beverage.

2714
02:29:55.24 --> 02:29:56.64
It's going to keep my kid quiet.

2715
02:29:56.64 --> 02:29:57.96
Make him happy.

2716
02:29:57.96 --> 02:30:00.48
You don't even know that there's an option that there's something that could keep

2717
02:30:00.48 --> 02:30:05.48
him quiet, make him happy, and make them stronger and smarter and better.

2718
02:30:05.48 --> 02:30:11.72
Yeah, so you know how like you or we whatever will discuss that really most things.

2719
02:30:11.72 --> 02:30:15.48
Pretty much everything in life can be broken down into short term and long term, like

2720
02:30:15.48 --> 02:30:18.64
battles, right?

2721
02:30:18.64 --> 02:30:22.60
Most of the time, by most I don't know really what I mean by most, but we'll just

2722
02:30:22.60 --> 02:30:25.32
say most of the time.

2723
02:30:25.32 --> 02:30:29.08
Usually if you chew short term, it's at the expense of a long term.

2724
02:30:29.08 --> 02:30:31.12
Usually they're exceptions.

2725
02:30:31.12 --> 02:30:36.76
But every once in a while you get something that fulfills both short term and long term.

2726
02:30:36.76 --> 02:30:42.04
Sushi, in my opinion, where you kid and monk.

2727
02:30:42.04 --> 02:30:43.04
That's another exception.

2728
02:30:43.04 --> 02:30:51.40
Short term gains, short term, pleasure, long term, not only said section, but long term gains.

2729
02:30:51.40 --> 02:30:55.96
And by the way, you can get all this stuff, including Jockel White T at the Vitamin Shop,

2730
02:30:55.96 --> 02:31:04.68
or you can get everything that we just talked about at Origin Main, the statema.ne.com.

2731
02:31:04.68 --> 02:31:05.68
True.

2732
02:31:05.68 --> 02:31:10.48
Also, Jockel is a store, it's called Jockel Store, and this is where you can get your very

2733
02:31:10.48 --> 02:31:18.36
own t-shirts, your very own rashguard, more rashguards, more representative of this path

2734
02:31:18.36 --> 02:31:23.92
that we're all on. Hats, hoodies, I don't know if I said hoodies are ready, but they're on

2735
02:31:23.92 --> 02:31:25.76
there, some women's stuff on there too.

2736
02:31:25.76 --> 02:31:30.72
We'll good stuff, good way to support, and more importantly, good way to represent.

2737
02:31:30.72 --> 02:31:33.20
Yeah, it's a good bone of feedies when you're out in the field.

2738
02:31:33.20 --> 02:31:34.20
Oh, big time.

2739
02:31:34.20 --> 02:31:37.84
You're just in the airport, you're representing, and all of a sudden, some of those,

2740
02:31:37.84 --> 02:31:39.84
they give you the nut.

2741
02:31:39.84 --> 02:31:40.84
Yep, the nut.

2742
02:31:40.84 --> 02:31:45.48
They give you the nut, and we know if something goes down, we know at least one person

2743
02:31:45.48 --> 02:31:48.32
we can count on over there, but it's a bowl of feedies.

2744
02:31:48.32 --> 02:31:49.32
Two.

2745
02:31:49.32 --> 02:31:50.32
Got that, you?

2746
02:31:50.32 --> 02:31:51.32
Yeah, definitely.

2747
02:31:51.32 --> 02:31:52.88
Of course, sure on your leg A with this guy's got my back.

2748
02:31:52.88 --> 02:31:54.72
Yeah, you feel the game he knows.

2749
02:31:54.72 --> 02:31:57.40
Put it in flag, fully.

2750
02:31:57.40 --> 02:32:03.24
Also, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on your iTunes or the state, or wherever

2751
02:32:03.24 --> 02:32:04.40
you listen to it.

2752
02:32:04.40 --> 02:32:07.24
It's a good benefit to subscribe, right?

2753
02:32:07.24 --> 02:32:11.44
You get the episode right in your, I don't know if you call it inbox or what, but you

2754
02:32:11.44 --> 02:32:13.52
get it on your phone.

2755
02:32:13.52 --> 02:32:17.64
And also, don't forget that we have the grounded podcast.

2756
02:32:17.64 --> 02:32:20.20
And the Warrior Kid podcast.

2757
02:32:20.20 --> 02:32:28.24
And don't forget, if you, if you like the Warrior Kid idea, can support one warrior kid named

2758
02:32:28.24 --> 02:32:35.60
Aiden who makes soap at IrishOxRanch.com.

2759
02:32:35.60 --> 02:32:37.24
Do we have it up on our site yet?

2760
02:32:37.24 --> 02:32:43.48
Currently, we're finalizing some stuff, but I did get my sample of the killer soap.

2761
02:32:43.48 --> 02:32:46.08
And very good, proved big time, right?

2762
02:32:46.08 --> 02:32:47.72
Now, you're supposed to kind of good too.

2763
02:32:47.72 --> 02:32:48.72
Yeah.

2764
02:32:48.72 --> 02:32:52.12
And the one of these flowery ones, which I dig it, the here's the thing, I'm not mad at flowery

2765
02:32:52.12 --> 02:32:53.12
soap.

2766
02:32:53.12 --> 02:32:54.12
I am.

2767
02:32:54.12 --> 02:32:57.80
Okay, I dig it, I fully dig it, but I am not.

2768
02:32:57.80 --> 02:33:01.48
In fact, everyone's well, I appreciate a little, not even necessarily flowery, but you know,

2769
02:33:01.48 --> 02:33:09.20
like a Irish, like a refreshing, you see them saying, unless the killer soap has a

2770
02:33:09.20 --> 02:33:15.32
scent to it's mild, but in a proved scent to it, well, it's tea tree oil.

2771
02:33:15.32 --> 02:33:17.48
But, but it's somewhat scent.

2772
02:33:17.48 --> 02:33:21.68
No, well, it has tea tree oil, but what it actually smells like to me is mint.

2773
02:33:21.68 --> 02:33:25.80
Like I, it's just, and it's, what about the visual effect?

2774
02:33:25.80 --> 02:33:27.08
Yeah, see, that's cool.

2775
02:33:27.08 --> 02:33:28.08
That's cool.

2776
02:33:28.08 --> 02:33:30.08
So, it's so awesome.

2777
02:33:30.08 --> 02:33:31.08
Yeah, it's good.

2778
02:33:31.08 --> 02:33:33.28
I knew what that soap was called.

2779
02:33:33.28 --> 02:33:34.28
Killer soap.

2780
02:33:34.28 --> 02:33:35.28
Killer soap.

2781
02:33:35.28 --> 02:33:40.20
Get rid of little, like nasties that are crawling on you.

2782
02:33:40.20 --> 02:33:41.20
Yeah.

2783
02:33:41.20 --> 02:33:47.20
And the other thing it helps you do is just goes ahead and it will help you stay clean.

2784
02:33:47.20 --> 02:33:48.20
Good.

2785
02:33:48.20 --> 02:33:52.72
That's a good thing to be helped with for sure.

2786
02:33:52.72 --> 02:33:57.84
Also, whether you tube channel, pretty much you have a YouTube channel.

2787
02:33:57.84 --> 02:33:59.12
No, no, no, it's the weed.

2788
02:33:59.12 --> 02:34:00.12
You're on the YouTube channel.

2789
02:34:00.12 --> 02:34:02.24
You're on the, let's face it.

2790
02:34:02.24 --> 02:34:04.24
You're on the YouTube channel.

02:34:04.24 --> 02:34:05.24
That's ours.

2792
02:34:05.24 --> 02:34:06.40
I'm on this sometimes.

2793
02:34:06.40 --> 02:34:09.76
If it's my YouTube channel, then what is it called?

2794
02:34:09.76 --> 02:34:10.76
Jockel podcast.

2795
02:34:10.76 --> 02:34:12.76
Okay, I guess I kinda get it.

2796
02:34:12.76 --> 02:34:13.76
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2797
02:34:13.76 --> 02:34:14.76
It's totally yours.

2798
02:34:14.76 --> 02:34:17.48
And, you know, you can see the video version of this podcast.

2799
02:34:17.48 --> 02:34:19.52
You want to see what Pat Mack looks like if you don't know already.

2800
02:34:19.52 --> 02:34:20.52
Yeah.

2801
02:34:20.52 --> 02:34:21.52
It's face it.

2802
02:34:21.52 --> 02:34:22.52
A lot of us knew already.

2803
02:34:22.52 --> 02:34:24.20
We really looked like, see what I'm saying?

2804
02:34:24.20 --> 02:34:28.56
But if you didn't, or you want to see more of whatever, whatever, you can see it on the

2805
02:34:28.56 --> 02:34:29.56
YouTube channel.

2806
02:34:29.56 --> 02:34:32.80
Also, ex some excerpts on there if you're interested in that, which is kind of cool.

2807
02:34:32.80 --> 02:34:35.64
We've talked about it before.

2808
02:34:35.64 --> 02:34:38.08
Fire, fire, explosions.

2809
02:34:38.08 --> 02:34:39.08
Okay.

2810
02:34:39.08 --> 02:34:40.08
Yeah.

2811
02:34:40.08 --> 02:34:41.08
Psychological warfare.

2812
02:34:41.08 --> 02:34:45.68
If you need a little, it's like a logical meter.

2813
02:34:45.68 --> 02:34:51.36
You can check that out on all MP3 platforms.

2814
02:34:51.36 --> 02:34:56.24
Me giving you a little boost, little spot, little psychological spot.

2815
02:34:56.24 --> 02:34:57.88
Get over the moment of weakness.

2816
02:34:57.88 --> 02:34:59.04
Flipsidecam is dot com.

2817
02:34:59.04 --> 02:35:02.48
My brother Dakota Meyer got all kinds of cool.

2818
02:35:02.48 --> 02:35:06.80
A graphical representations of the path.

2819
02:35:06.80 --> 02:35:10.52
You can check that out if you want to hang up something on your wall that says discipline

2820
02:35:10.52 --> 02:35:12.52
equals freedom.

2821
02:35:12.52 --> 02:35:14.56
We want to hang up the warrior kid code.

2822
02:35:14.56 --> 02:35:15.56
You can find it there.

2823
02:35:15.56 --> 02:35:17.76
Got a bunch of books.

2824
02:35:17.76 --> 02:35:21.64
The latest is called Leadership Strategy and Tactics Field Manual.

2825
02:35:21.64 --> 02:35:23.76
Appreciate everyone hooking that up.

2826
02:35:23.76 --> 02:35:28.40
And now what I see is people posting that they bought 14 of them for every person on their

2827
02:35:28.40 --> 02:35:29.40
team.

2828
02:35:29.40 --> 02:35:31.92
And I'm going to tell you, get every person on your team.

2829
02:35:31.92 --> 02:35:36.16
Moving in that direction, your team is going to rock and roll.

2830
02:35:36.16 --> 02:35:38.40
So check that one out for the kids out there.

2831
02:35:38.40 --> 02:35:41.28
We got way the warrior kid one two and three.

2832
02:35:41.28 --> 02:35:46.68
And we got for the little or kids, Mikey and the dragons.

2833
02:35:46.68 --> 02:35:47.68
Get those books.

2834
02:35:47.68 --> 02:35:51.28
Get them for even if it's like your neighbor kid.

2835
02:35:51.28 --> 02:35:57.64
Look, is your life going to be better if your neighbor kid turns out to be a loser?

2836
02:35:57.64 --> 02:36:02.64
Is that out to be a drug addict?

2837
02:36:02.64 --> 02:36:03.000
Turns out to be a non-contributing member of society.

2838
02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.64
Do you want that kid living next door?

2839
02:36:04.64 --> 02:36:06.64
No, you want to warrior kid living next door.

2840
02:36:06.64 --> 02:36:11.20
Why not get your the neighborhood kids on the warrior kid path?

2841
02:36:11.20 --> 02:36:12.76
Get them all the book.

2842
02:36:12.76 --> 02:36:15.40
Get them Mikey and the dragons so they can overcome fear.

2843
02:36:15.40 --> 02:36:22.000
Let's change the culture of America and make kids warriors.

2844
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.84
I don't think that's too.

2845
02:36:23.84 --> 02:36:25.84
I don't think that's too much to ask.

2846
02:36:25.84 --> 02:36:27.92
No, no, no, no, no.

2847
02:36:27.92 --> 02:36:29.60
Discipline goes freedom, feel manual.

2848
02:36:29.60 --> 02:36:36.40
There's a book that you get for yourself for people that you know that you want to help

2849
02:36:36.40 --> 02:36:40.68
them, help yourself to have more discipline.

2850
02:36:40.68 --> 02:36:44.12
Because if you have more discipline, guess what you're going to end up with more freedom.

2851
02:36:44.12 --> 02:36:47.92
Hence, discipline goes freedom, field manual, how to get after it.

2852
02:36:47.92 --> 02:36:52.64
And then there's extreme ownership and the economy of leadership, which are leadership

Be able to take care of yourself and the people around you and the way you do that is to go

out there every single day and get after it.
