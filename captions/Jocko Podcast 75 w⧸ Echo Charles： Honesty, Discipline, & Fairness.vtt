00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 75 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We have shared the incomunicable experience of war.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We have felt we still feel the passion of life to its top.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In our youth, our hearts were touched by fire.

5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That's a quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Supreme Court Judge.

6
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Lots of people know that, but they may not know Civil War soldier served with a 20th

7
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Regiment of Massachusetts and volunteer infantry, saw action all over the place.

8
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Pencil campaign, the wilderness.

9
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
He was wounded at the Battle of Balls.

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Bluff also wounded and anti-dem.

11
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And also wounded at the Battle of Chancellorville.

12
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So I think it's safe to say that he knew and understood war.

13
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And that quote right there is from the beginning of another book about another man

14
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that knew war.

15
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Major Dick Winners. Now we've covered Dick Winners before his book on this podcast.

16
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Number 17, Beyond Band of Brothers.

17
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Great book, lots of lessons learned, but there's another book.

18
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We just called the Conversations with Major Dick Winters.

19
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Life lessons from the commander of the band of brothers.

20
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And it's written by a guy named Colonel Cole C. King Seed.

21
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Who was a friend Dick Winners and who actually was the co-author behind that book Beyond Band of Brothers.

22
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So what's cool about this book is it really parses out some lessons about leadership in a conversational manner with Dick Winners.

23
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The things that he thought and the lessons that he learned, which, I mean, when you get an opportunity to learn from someone like this, you know what I do?

24
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I just be quiet. I listen and I learn or in this case I read and I learn.

25
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So this is also the guy. If you haven't seen this series on HBO, Band of Brothers, just go stop and just go watch it.

26
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's, I don't know what it is, like 12, 12 episodes. They're all awesome.

27
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Every ask me all the time, what's a realistic war movies.

28
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That one band of brothers and then the Pacific, both HBO series, they're both phenomenal.

29
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And I recommend you watch it. You learn a lot about Dick Winners on that and the guy that plays Dick Winners does a great job.

30
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And the way they tell the story and the realism and all that, it's just an awesome series.

31
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But here we can learn not interpreted through a movie, but actually from the man as he spoke it. So here we go, taking it back to the book right now.

32
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Look, Dick Winners.

33
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
D-Day was my first time in combat. So right there, let's just talk about that for a second.

34
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Your first time in combat, what's your mission? D-Day?

35
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
One of the largest military operations of all time. That's your first day in combat. Get some.

36
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Back to the book. I was mentally prepared and felt that I had done everything necessary to prepare myself for this precise moment.

37
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And you never know if you will measure up as a leader until the minute arrives when you face the enemy for the first time.

38
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Baptism by fire is a soldier's sacrament. There is always doubt.

39
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Hopefully, in combat, you perform as you train.

40
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So I can't imagine that baptism by fire. D-Day.

41
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Again, get some sense of another good movie, saving private Ryan. The opening scene of that is the same thing.

42
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And that's one of the most intense parts of a movie ever is the D-Day when they're hitting the beaches. It's crazy to watch.

43
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But watch it because it will give you a feeling for what Dick Winners is talking about. Just imagine all these preparation that you do.

44
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
You're getting ready and guess what? Here it comes. Little mission called D-Day.

45
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now, that was their initial operation during D-Day, but then they fought all over the place. And again, we covered this in Beyond Band of Brothers.

46
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But one of the most intense parts of their campaign was at bestone.

47
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So even though D-Day was hard, things didn't get easier once D-Day was complete. As much as I'm saying, oh yeah, D-Day was crazy. Guess what?

48
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
It wasn't even the hardest part for them. Things got worse.

49
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Back to the book, most of the soldiers in easy company also felt that bastone was the most challenging month of the war.

50
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Staff Sergeant Bill Gwarnier later claimed that he had been scared before, but he was absolutely petrified at bastone.

51
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
From my perspective, bastone was the most miserable place I've been in my life.

52
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I was wet through and through. And naturally being a pair trooper, I didn't have a change of clothes, no blanket, nothing.

53
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And it was a cold son of a gun.

54
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Things were all snaffed, walking around in the black of night, not knowing where we were exactly where everybody else was.

55
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
How's his burning civilians crying, ringing your hands, and behind every bush, a perspective enemy?

56
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
We took our greatest number of casualties during that campaign.

57
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Easy company was never the same after bastone.

58
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We lost so many because we lost so many veterans who had fought in Normandy and Holland.

59
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Joe Toy, Bill Gwarnier, Buck Compton, Don Hubler, and many others.

60
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So this is where I started thinking, okay, leadership lesson learned right here.

61
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I operated the Battalion Command Post that was situated approximately 75 yards from the main line of resistance.

62
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:54.000
You might not think 75 yards is consequential, but it gave me the opportunity to think things through and divorce myself from the chaos surrounding the front line and to make calm, rational decisions under pressure.

63
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
That is the toughest challenge for any leader.

64
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So obviously we're talking about detachment here, and I've talked about the fact that in order to detach, you can move off the line like six inches.

65
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I'm not kidding in a smaller group, you know, in a single putton, he's talking about a battalion, so they got hundreds of guys.

66
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So 75 yards is more appropriate, but if you're running a smaller unit, like one company or maybe a putton, you got 3040 guys.

67
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:34.000
If you move back off that firing line, six inches, a foot, maybe you know, maybe three feet or six feet, you just step back and you get yourself out of that fire fight where you can look around.

68
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
That's what you're going to be able to do.

69
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
You're going to be able to detach yourself from the chaos and the mayhem and make calm, rational decisions under pressure.

70
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And that's such a big deal, like when you do that, when you detach, and then you can, you know, you have a clear revision, and a lot of times the answer or solution to some big problem is just so simple.

71
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Remember that story you're telling at the muster where, you know, your, your guys had an injured neck, so he could participate, but he went to come along, so he's watching them outside, and he's like, why don't they just, what do you step back and peel left?

72
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Why don't they, why don't they get all my impules left? Yeah, whatever the call was, so the story is there was a guy that actually he was the Delta Patoon commander and T. You bruiser. He took over my position. He took over the T. You bruiser commander and then I was running the training. So once I was running the training, you know, now I was overall, making things happen and he was going through the training.

73
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:44.000
A different block of training and he broke his neck, broke his neck, and thank God he didn't hurt his spinal cord, but he broke a vertebrae in his neck. So he had to wear one of those big crazy neck braces.

74
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And he couldn't actually do the physical training. It wasn't allowed to bury any weight for a certain amount of time, but, you know, luckily he was able to keep his, his job because he was very experienced.

75
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And so we were going through the land warfare portion of training. And I said, hey man, you know, I know you can't participate, but come out with me. You know, come out and check it out and you can see your guys and you can watch out there perform and you can teach them some stuff and learn from, from what happens.

76
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So cool, he comes out and he's actually one of my, you know, one of my best friends. So of course we just want to hang out anyways.

77
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So you know, of course we, he has a chance to come out and hang out with me. The desert for a few weeks is going to do it. So we, we get out there and, and you know, you've heard the stories about the training that I ran. It was really hard and evil and crazy and psychotic.

78
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And we're doing that, you know, we got, we, in that case, we had these really high speed laser laser tag system and you got guys pinned down. You got explosions going off. You got, just total mayhem going on and his guys kind of froze up.

79
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And they're all pinned down in this little sort of ravine valley type thing and I got guys, I got my guys, my opposing force. So the seals that are pretending to be bad guys pretending to be moved. They're all up in the mountains, shooting down on them and killing everyone.

80
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And his guy is his leadership is just kind of frozen and they're sitting there and not doing anything. And you know, he says to me, hey, can I help them?

81
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And I kind of thought about it from it. I go, yeah, go ahead. I go, give him, you know, tell him what to do, give him a prompt.

82
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And he, and he just, you know, goes down to the leader, one of the leaders and says, hey, get online and peel left.

83
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And so the guy looks at him and what does get online mean? Just it's an organizational movement where all your troops are pointed in all different directions.

84
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Boom, you'd say contact right online. And that means everyone's going to basically face that direction. You'll get a couple guys that are doing rare security, a couple guys that are doing flex security, but everyone is now oriented in the same direction.

85
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And then the next call that comes is peel left boom and they're all going to start moving, you know, in a direction that's going to get them out of this immediate threat.

86
00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So he tells he kind of says the guy, hey, get online peel left. So the guy looks at him and he just yells out, get online peel left and then everyone repeats that command and then everyone does it.

87
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And within a minute, they're home free literally took like one minute once they made a decision. So, and then so they get out of there and he looks at me and he goes, he goes, pan, it's so easy when you're way up here. Now way up here to put it in perspective was

88
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:37.000
for feet behind these guys. That's all it was. It wasn't like we were up on some mountain top with some incredible view. No, we were we were there. We were standing next to the guys and we are a little bit elevated because they're laying down and we were standing up, but it's it was not inconceivable that you wouldn't have the same perspective. If you just step back and maybe you know, shuffleed over a little bit.

89
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And he says, it's so easy when when you're up here. And I said, bro, you remember when we went through training and he says, yeah, and I said, it was always like this for me. And it was I was I would always just place myself back just enough to be able to see what the solution is.

90
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So, yes, this detachment that he's talking about and again, in a battalion situation where you're going to 75 yards and hitting a business situation, you know, I actually see people do this, you're in a meeting. And there's everyone around the, around the table and there's some problem that can't be solved.

91
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And you get literally step up and get step away from the table and just step back get away from the group because they're all mobbed up and group think everyone's going down the same trail. They're thinking about the same stuff and there's no new ideas because they're all right there and there's a vortex step away from the table.

92
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Yeah, it's same thing like step step away from your computer.

93
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Yeah, you get to some point where you're just you don't know where to go with some, you're looking for some kind of a solution to a problem step back step back see more. Yeah, yeah and writing a lot of times.

94
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:53.000
They'll suggest just skip to the end don't worry about like this. Just go to the end. How do you want to end and then interesting it'll kind of open your mind up. It'll make you sort of forget about this problem right in front of you, you know, yeah, you can kind of an overall view of you towards the solution that you know can be found.

95
00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Yeah, even in an argument with life or something like that. Oh yeah, well for sure that's a big one for sure because when you yeah you definitely need to do it there and you're in trash. You don't need to get in trash and don't do that.

96
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Yeah, all right and this part's been covered before on multiple occasions, you know what we're going to do covered again.

97
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Little piece about discipline, I did have a routine or routine that was instilled into me by Colonel sink.

98
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:34.000
At Coa Colonel sink insisted that officers always shave in the morning regardless of the situation. He would say you shave every morning for the troops and if you want to shave every evening for the women that's up to you.

99
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I followed his orders because I realized that I had to set the proper example for the men.

100
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I needed to get their attention and let them all know that I intended to be around for a while and that the situation was not as bad as they might think.

101
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I remember before second batalion attacked for I had awakened early and shaved before I ate breakfast.

102
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I later discovered that I'd cut my face in multiple places. Colonel sink came up to check on the baton's readiness before the attack commenced. He took one look at me and smiled.

103
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I realized that he was laughing at me for shaving on that bitterly cold morning. In hindsight, shaving at zero dark 30 and freezing temperatures was pretty ridiculous.

104
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So, you know, we talk about this all the time, got to shave, got to maintain unmedicated daily discipline and all things.

105
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But what's cool about what I, the reason I wanted to go over this again is because look at what he's doing psychologically to the troops.

106
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
He's saying, I know I had to set an example. I need to get their attention.

107
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And make them realize that, hey, we're going to be here for a while. And you know what? I'm just going to go daily. This is no big deal. Oh, you're worried about this stuff. I'm still shaving over here.

108
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I'm still waking up at zero 400 shaving. And you're worried about this stuff. Nothing's going to worry about. We're good to go.

109
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And you need to maintain the same discipline. So that leading by example, clearly is a big deal right there and maintaining that routine, maintaining that discipline.

110
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Now speaking of discipline back to the book, regardless of how disciplined an outfit is, too much time on your hands, too little activity and too much alcohol, make a volatile combination.

111
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So this book skips around a little bit. But I put this in here because this is actually talking about when they were done fighting.

112
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And now everyone is kind of idle. He has some idle people on their hands, but it related to discipline. So I wanted to lock it in a little bit back to the book.

113
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000
The batalion was no longer combat unit, but a garrison outfit. It was more important to keep the troops gainfully employed to prevent boredom and monotony.

114
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
That would lead to a breakdown in discipline. And when that occurs, soldiers get careless.

115
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Consequently, the first thing we organized were calisthenics and athletic programs.

116
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
You know, I always joke about, you know, when people say they have some kind of problem and I'm, oh, do burpees.

117
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Right. Hey, you know what a good solution to all problems are calisthenics. Just start doing calisthenics. I like that. I like that attitude.

118
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I vividly recall this is this is another reason I put this in.

119
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I vividly recall watching the men strip to their waist or only wearing their shorts as they played baseball.

120
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:17.000
The sight of all those scars may be conscious of the fact that only a handful of men in the batalion had been lucky enough to make it through all four campaigns without at least one scar.

121
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Some men had two, three, or even four scars on their chest, back, arms, or legs.

122
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Keep in mind that this was after the war. So I was looking only at men who were not seriously wounded.

123
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Next, we set up rifle ranges and sharpened our marksmanship.

124
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Close order drill and troop reviews were once again back on the training schedule.

125
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I also established a schedule where each of our four platoons could rotate every 72 hours to a ski lodge in the Alps for rest and relaxation.

126
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
The purpose of using this retreat was to let the men get away from the routine of a military schedule.

127
00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So first of all, when I got to seal team one, and actually it wasn't when I first got there, but there was a Master Chief at seal team one that had showed up in 1971 or 1972 to seal team one.

128
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And seal team one, you know, you had 150 guys roughly on the team at that time.

129
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And they had had 34 killed an action in Vietnam at seal team one.

130
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And I don't know how many wounded, but it was a lot.

131
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000
But this guy who's a Master Chief when I met him, and he was telling me that when he, you know, at the seal team, you know, you PT in the morning,

132
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
just like a sports team, you get to work and you work out.

133
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And here's a new guy, right? And he's they, they PT, and then they go in the shower, you know, to wash off and he's the same thing.

134
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
He's like looking at every single guy's scarred up wounded, you know, slashes on their chest, bullet holes in him.

135
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And he kind of was saying to himself, damn, you know, this has been trial by fire for these guys.

136
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:08.000
But beyond that, what he's talking about here clearly is, if you, and I'll tell you this, especially with, you know, 18 year old, 19 year old, 20 year old males that have joined the military.

137
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
If you don't find something for them to do productive, they're going to find something to do.

138
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
That's not going to be productive.

139
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:23.000
It'll be fun for him. It'll be fun for him. They're going to have a good time, but it's not, there's a chance they could be doing something better than what you're letting them do.

140
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Now, of course, he talks about the fact that he's given him still given him time to go out to the ski lodge and break away from it a little bit.

141
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
But you just got to be careful on how you do that. You got to be careful on how you do that.

142
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
It's, it can backfire if you're not careful.

143
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And the first time I was ever kind of detached from a seal,

144
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Patoon on a, it was when I went to training the training department at Seal Team 1,

145
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
we'll use to call training cell, which sounds legit.

146
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
I didn't love the legit.

147
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
So at training cell, the first trip I went on with a Patoon, because I was always in the Patoon.

148
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
So the first trip I went on with the Patoon, and I was outside of the Patoon,

149
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and I was, you could say I was an instructor, even though we weren't running around calling ourselves instructor instructors.

150
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
We would call ourselves actually the Cadray.

151
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I don't know why.

152
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
It was like, oh, yeah, Cadray.

153
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Sounds dope.

154
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Yes.

155
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
We left an official term, though.

156
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
It is an official term.

157
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Yeah, Cadray.

158
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
The training cadre.

159
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
So when we were at training cell, because the instructors are kind of considered the buds instructors, the

160
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
basic training, and we didn't really want to be buds instructors, we were the cadre.

161
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Yeah.

162
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
So, and I never, I didn't, this is just, this is just my own assessment.

163
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I didn't make up cadre, I didn't call ourselves cadre, and make up training cell.

164
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I wish I would have made up all those things, but I just flowed into them as a lucky young new guy.

165
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Actually, at this point, I wasn't a new guy anymore.

166
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Wait, but it's true, though, right?

167
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
It's not like you just gave yourself a title that was,

168
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
No, no, no, we were the, yeah, you, you, you're training cadre.

169
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Yeah.

170
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Oh, hey, I need to talk to you guys in the cadre over here.

171
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Yeah, that's what we call ourselves.

172
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Yeah, yeah, so it's like, you know, like, let's say you open a Getsagee gym,

173
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
and then, you know, you're teaching people, and then you're like, okay, yeah, I'm the instructor,

174
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
and then you say, you know what, I like professor, that's better.

175
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Yeah, I know, what is that?

176
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
It's not that.

177
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
I didn't make that.

178
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
No, no, no, no, they called, you know, for years.

179
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And actually, I think Roger Hayden talked about it when he was on the podcast.

180
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
He was talking about when he was cadre.

181
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
So, right, it's been around forever.

182
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Right, that's why I just like professor, it's like, it's true.

183
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Yeah, it's a true, you are the professor, but it's like, it just sounds better.

184
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
You know, it sounds better.

185
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
So you're not going to go with that one.

186
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Just go with cadre.

187
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Yeah, yeah, like none of you know, the one I was talking about.

188
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Oh, so I was in the cadre for the first time.

189
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
And we went on a trip.

190
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
We went to a trip where they have good times to be had, where we were.

191
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
It was a place where there was some good training, but there was also good times.

192
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And, you know, I picked this up from Harley-Flyne again.

193
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
This term, which I hadn't really heard wild thing.

194
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Did you hear him say that?

195
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
He's like, oh, we were just wilding.

196
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Yeah.

197
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I think it's better term than the term that we discussed, which was partying.

198
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Right.

199
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Right.

200
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Oh, there's good, we are partying.

201
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Yeah.

202
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I like wilding better.

203
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Because that entails all kinds of other things.

204
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Little bit more wild.

205
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Yeah, wilding out or wilding out or wilding out.

206
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I never really heard it.

207
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I never really heard it before.

208
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
But when Harley said me clearly, you know what it is.

209
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
And it's in his book too.

211
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
He talks about wilding.

212
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
So we went to this place with a seal platoon where there was good training and good wilding

213
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
to be had.

214
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And I remember the first time that these guys, you know, we get there.

215
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
We work a little bit and then they're going to go out into the town.

216
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And I remember thinking myself, they've been in the field for a few days.

217
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And they were all fired up, young frogmen.

218
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And I was thinking myself, how is this even going to work?

219
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Like, there's no possibility of this going well.

220
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And it did, you know, everyone find me.

221
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
You just see all these guys.

222
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
They're ready to, you know, they're ready to explode.

223
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And you're going to, they've been in the field.

224
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And if dehydrated, they've been in the field for four days or five days, they're all dehydrated.

225
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And they completed their operation.

226
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
They feel good about it.

227
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Now you're going to let them out in time.

228
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Yeah, you got to be careful with those scenarios.

229
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
You got to put something.

230
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Yeah, we would, you know, sometimes you just say, hey, look, yeah, do whatever you want.

231
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Tonight, but we're peating tomorrow at 0700.

232
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
So then everyone knows they can, they can wild to a point.

233
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
But they can't, they got to put some kind of a governor.

234
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Some kind of a go on this scenario.

235
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Here's a cool piece where Dick Winters, you know, he talks about this before it.

236
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000
But just just a piece about his view of what America was doing at the time, back to the book.

237
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000
The United States went to war, not to conquer territory, or to subject their fellow man,

238
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
but merely to liberate a conquered people from the chains of tyranny.

239
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
There is a certain nobility in all that.

240
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Today we are bombarded in the news media about how everyone hates America and how this country is deployed around the world.

241
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
World War II wasn't like that, and I am proud to be a part of it.

242
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
So again, I've said this a bunch of times.

243
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:12.000
You know, we went there and lost hundreds of thousands of people in Europe and in the Pacific theater.

244
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
And we took nothing.

245
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000
We only gave some thoughts on leadership from Dick Winters.

246
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Leadership, leadership's defining quality is honesty.

247
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
To honesty, add fairness and consistency.

248
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000
I was able to develop a sixth sense during the war that allowed me to size up a situation rapidly.

249
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I could look at terrain and be able to see opportunities instead of challenges by leading from the front.

250
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
I believe I achieved a high degree of success.

251
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
So I thought that was a very very interesting combination.

252
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Honesty, fairness, and consistency.

253
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
You don't hear those a lot about being a great leader.

254
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
I mean, I always talk about the number one attribute of a leader is humility.

255
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And I definitely believe that humility is important, but honesty, that's clearly a thought and a concept of leadership that I think that misses a lot of people.

256
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I think, and we've talked about plenty of cases on the podcast here where we say,

257
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Oh, what if this is going on and I say, look, you want to be honest with them.

258
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:32.000
So I've definitely said that before, but I'm going to start saying it more because I'm learning a little something from Dick Winters today.

259
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
But you know, I remember we had a case where someone was saying, hey, I'm going to leave this job or I'm going to take another job and what should I do?

260
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Should I tell them, should I not? And we kind of went around and I was like, look, just tell me truth.

261
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Just say, look, hey, this is what's going on.

262
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
I'm going to be, I've got a better opportunity.

263
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000
I'm going to take it because, and in the long run, you're in the long run, it's going to be, you're going to be better off if you're honest with people.

264
00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And so obviously, to think about this quality, it's something I've thought about, but not as clearly as this as Dick Winters.

265
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
As Dick Winters saying, that's the defining quality.

266
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
That's obviously important, something that I will talk about more now.

267
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Definitely believe that, but we'll talk about it more.

268
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Now, if you've seen the movie, Ben or Brothers, or the series, Ben or Brothers, they do a good job of showing to be getting when they form up.

269
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
And there's a guy in the leadership position called Captain Sobel.

270
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And he's not a good leader. And they do a good job of portraying why he wasn't a good leader in the series.

271
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
But here's what Dick Winters had to say about it back to the book.

272
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Captain Sobel commanded through fear and intimidation.

273
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
That is not how a leader should conduct himself.

274
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Sobel was not just unfair. He was mean-spirited.

275
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
His attitude created a special bond within an easy company that allowed the men to identify with their pletoons more.

276
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000
And he's got a lot of their pletoons more so within with the company, which is more normal in most uner military units.

277
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Second lieutenants by their nature are a clandish group.

278
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
So you've got a company commander and he's got three usually three pletoons underneath him.

279
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
And each one of those is run by a second lieutenant.

280
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
So these second lieutenants are the pletoon commanders.

281
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Second lieutenants by their nature are a clandish group.

282
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Some are more serious than others, but for the most part, they wander around a military post as General Heiz now or once said,

283
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
In a rather aimless search for excitement.

284
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Easy companies, platoon leaders, of which I was one,

285
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
They are best to take care of our soldiers to soften.

286
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Sobel's dictatorial behavior.

287
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
I lost all respect for our commander.

288
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
The day he announced to the officers in easy company,

289
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
We will lead through fear, not by example.

290
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
That's just the opposite of any leadership principle that I could ever conceive.

291
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
It's to lead through fear instead of example.

292
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Kind of like when you're dead.

293
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Well, I don't know about your dead, but if your death says,

294
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Or if you say to your kids, do what I say, not what I do.

295
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
You know what I do?

296
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
You know what I've heard that for sure?

297
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
For sure.

298
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
That's it.

299
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
And if you want to put the fear onto that, do what I say not what I do or else.

300
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Or else.

301
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Yeah.

302
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I'm going to get out the belt or the kids down south.

303
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
They say, yeah, then I'm going to get out the switch.

304
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Yeah, I get out the switch.

305
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
I don't know what I'm saying.

306
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Not all the time, but you know, he said that.

307
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
He said switch, where was he from?

308
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
That's from Brooklyn, New York.

309
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
They got no switches in Brooklyn, New York.

310
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
I'm here to tell you.

311
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
On quiet, they do.

312
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
On quiet, they found someone.

313
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
He made me go get my switch.

314
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
He said go get a switch.

315
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
I don't know what that means by the way.

316
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
At this point.

317
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Okay.

318
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
You're a little kid.

319
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Yeah.

320
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Go get one.

321
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
And I'm from quiet.

322
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
They don't say switch, you know, apparently.

323
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Other people say switch.

324
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
I didn't know.

325
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Which made him kind of more mad.

326
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
So then he had to brief you on what a switch was.

327
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Yeah, this is the thing I'm going to be doing.

328
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
It's kind of like digging your own grave in a way.

329
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Very, very, very, very simple.

330
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Yeah.

331
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Very simple.

332
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Yeah.

333
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Back to the book.

334
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
It made such an impression on me that I recorded his words in my diary.

335
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Under ordinary circumstances, a junior company officer attempts to reflect his company

336
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
commanders leadership style.

337
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
But easy companies, lieutenants, found that they simply could not emulate the images so

338
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Bell and still live with themselves.

339
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
So Bell had no friends within the company and few within the regimen.

340
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
At the end of each day, he went one way and we lieutenants went another hoping not to run into

341
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
him at the officers club.

342
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
He lacked confidence in his own ability as an infantry commander.

343
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000
He was completely honest, but he couldn't read a map to save his neck.

344
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
His knowledge of tactics and fire maneuver was extremely poor.

345
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
So horrible situation.

346
00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
And this is one of those things where he's talking about how everyone no one in hang around

347
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
with him.

348
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Right?

349
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And I've heard leaders say, a good leader's not going to be like,

350
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
they're not going to be loved by everyone.

351
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And that there's some truth to that.

352
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Right?

353
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Of course, not everyone's going to love you.

354
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
But there's also a difference when no one likes you.

355
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
You're not doing a good job.

356
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
You're not doing a good job at all.

357
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
And you know, I hung out with all my guys all the time through the chain of command.

358
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Everyone to hang out.

359
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Let's go.

360
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Let's hang out.

361
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Wasn't running away from me at the end of the water.

362
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
You were scared.

363
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
That's not a good sign.

364
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Yeah.

365
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Like one guy say, I'm no hear to make friends.

366
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Yeah, that's another classic, right?

367
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I'm not hear to make friends.

368
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
No, but I actually, you know, there's, I heard officers say that in the military.

369
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
You see officers, I've heard say, look, you.

370
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And they'll say like, it's not a popularity contest, which is not clearly.

371
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
You're going to make decisions.

372
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
I'm going to be hard for people to swallow.

373
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
But to have people running away from you because they don't like you as a human being.

374
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
That's not a good position to be in.

375
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
You're, you're not doing a good job as a leader.

376
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
You need to reassess what you're, what you're, what you're doing and how you're doing it.

377
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Mm.

378
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:14.000
And this is kind of reflective of what Dick Winner's attitude was back to the book.

379
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Easy company didn't belong to me.

380
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
It belonged to the soldiers.

381
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
I was privileged to be a small part of its history.

382
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Officers and commanders in particular are merely caretakers.

383
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
That the peer-to-peer's respected me is more than enough reward.

384
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
So there's just totally, totally different attitude, right?

385
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
And there's something weird that happens with the military.

386
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
You'll hear a guy, it's a contradictory state.

387
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
There's a dichotomy.

388
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
You'll hear a guy say, my soldiers or my Marines.

389
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And there's two ways that that can be taken.

390
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
One of them is very positive.

391
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
My soldiers.

392
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
I am going to take care of my soldiers.

393
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Hey, don't come down here and talk to my soldiers like that.

394
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Or, hey, you know, I need to make sure my soldiers have the gear that they need.

395
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
I need to make sure my Marines have.

396
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
And that's a, they mean that in the best possible way.

397
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
There's another side to that, which is completely negative, which is, these are my Marines.

398
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Me and you own them.

399
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Me and you all do what I want with them.

400
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
And so I've seen guys on both sides of that edge.

401
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
You hear a good, you can hear a good leader say my Marines.

402
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
You can hear a good leader say my soldiers.

403
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
You can hear a good leader say my seals.

404
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
And think of it in a positive way.

405
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
And you can have a crappy leader say my soldiers.

406
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
My Marines my seals.

407
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
And you just think dude, no.

408
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And so for, and especially when you get dick winners who is, you know, universally respected in his, in the military and definitely in his battalion and his company.

409
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
And he's a guy that's saying look, it was theirs.

410
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
That just tells you that's where your leadership perspective should come from.

411
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Yeah, I always felt that a better way instead of saying my, one of the few things as far as feelings go because I, I, I, I experienced that a lot when people be like my, this and that, you know, and I see what you're doing.

412
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
It's like you're just the boss and the owner of all this kind of thing, you know, kind of thing.

413
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:36.000
But with it felt like, and feels like with people like my soldiers, you know, there is a lot of room for like, because men, these are my brothers, you know, my guys, but let's say they're talking about like something else like a big one.

414
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Like the bartenders that you so work with everyone's in a while, you'd have one and say well, I got this and you know, my bar and when they talk to the customers, you know, they're like hey, what kind of, I don't know, vodka do you have.

415
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And then they tell my best vodka is, you know, this and that, then they'd say my, you know, kind of like I'm the master of this whole domain here, everything here is mine, and that I can bestow upon you kind of feeling.

416
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Yeah, that's all he's kind of.

417
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Well, they do do it.

418
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Definitely in the military with inanimate objects, not just soldiers and Marines and sailors, they do it with inanimate objects.

419
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And you learn that book camp where they, you know, they say, why are you on my parade deck right?

420
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
And he gives you this feeling of like, this guy's really into this parade deck, I mean, I'm, you know, where you do marching.

421
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Yeah, they say get off my parade deck and it instills that kind of personal pride about something.

422
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
So again, even that one can go both ways.

423
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Yeah, I guess it really, you really have to understand what your intent is behind what you're saying and you have to be careful.

424
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
I, I always, I feel subconscious about that.

425
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
And I'll give you an example.

426
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000
My gym. Yeah, right, my gym. When I, when I talk about victory MMA, which, you know, we have partners and it's not solely my gym.

427
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
You know, but it's my gym where I change train, right?

428
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
But sometimes someone will say something and I'll feed it, like, oh, where do you train?

429
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
You know, and I could say I train in my gym.

430
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
You know what I mean? I feel like I'm real.

431
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Turned when I do that.

432
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
I got all victory MMA in front of us, you know, yeah, oh, Dean Mr. Jeff Glover, yeah, that's where I train.

433
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
And away, do you own that place? Yeah, yeah, I'm one of the owners in the normal block.

434
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
But yeah, you don't like that.

435
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
My, oh, you get to say it.

436
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Careful. What a careful way to be careful with that too.

437
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:26.000
I always thought if you said, hour, you know, especially even in a bartender situation, what we have, it's kind of like us as an establishment.

438
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Right. You know, kind of thing.

439
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
I'm part of that when you say, are you're part of it?

440
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
You know, so it kind of still puts that forward.

441
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Like, I'm kind of giving this to you or offering whatever.

442
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
I'm taking some ownership, but it's like, I'm not the boss of this thing. It kind of feels that way. That's what I always thought.

443
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
So even if you like in your situation, if you're like, you know, someone's like, hey, Doc, where do you train?

444
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
We say, well, at our gym, you know, and it's kind of ambiguous as well, which kind of seems more humble.

445
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
You know, where it's like, oh, yeah, you could be just a member, but at least you're part of that community, you know, kind of thing.

446
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
So yeah, the use are, we'll get it.

447
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
That's what we're talking about.

448
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
That's what we're talking about.

449
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

450
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Definitely careful with my marine, this my soldiers, and again, sometimes that's the most positive thing you could possibly say.

451
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Mm-hmm.

452
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
These are my seals.

453
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Hey, don't come down here and think you're going to put my seals out in the field in a bad situation.

454
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Not happening. You know what I mean? You're protective.

455
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
There are brothers. You know, you have ownership of them, but it's in the, it's in the, it's in the, the positive way.

456
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Yeah, as opposed to look, all deploying my seals wherever I see fit.

457
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Oh, put a, put a red flag on that dude's face.

458
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Yeah.

459
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Right.

460
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Back to the book.

461
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
I think of easy company every day.

462
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000
We sustained 150% casualties between the night that we jumped into Normandy and VE day.

463
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
150% casualties.

464
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
So those of you that are wondering how you do that, how you do that, as you have people getting wounded multiple times and coming back to the front.

465
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
And when your replacement show up, they get wounded too.

466
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So you, you know, you've got whatever 150 people in your, in your company.

467
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And over the course of time, people get wounded and leave and new people come in to take their place and they get wounded as well.

468
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
And that's how you get up over a hundred percent of your people being wounded.

469
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
The result of sharing all the stress throughout training and combat has created a bond between the men of easy company that will last for a month.

470
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
In a sense, I don't think I ever left company E.

471
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:42.000
I may never again see the type of men in this outfit, but to me easy company will always be my company.

472
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
In the sense that I will always remain a part of it.

473
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
To this day, they remain my second family.

474
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000
I still look at these men with great respect, respect that can't describe in words.

475
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
So there he makes it the same thing.

476
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Like he feels uncomfortable saying, mine, he has to put a, a quantify on it and explain, hey, not in that sense, but always be a part of it.

477
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
That's why it's mine.

478
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
More about leadership back to the book, leadership is difficult to define.

479
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
They talk about leadership at West Point every day.

480
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Leadership starts with honesty, dedication, and having a man who is dependable and fair.

481
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:40.000
If you never deviate from the standards that you established, men have faith in you, and you'll be out front to set the example.

482
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Sergeant Talbert once told me, sir, I'd follow you into hell.

483
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
I'd take a great deal of pride in his remark.

484
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
So again, we're getting this leadership starts with honesty, dedication, dependable and fair.

485
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
So important, so important, being fair.

486
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
And you see that a lot when it comes to dilling out punishment when people make mistakes.

487
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Are you fair enough?

488
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
You know, does that person really deserve to lose their pay for 90 days or go on bread and water?

489
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Whatever kind of punishment you're going to bestow on someone?

490
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Is that fair?

491
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And people know if things are fair or not.

492
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
People know what's reasonable.

493
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Hey, do you think that, you know, when people say, I'm going to make an example out of somebody, you know, for, sometimes it's for different reasons.

494
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Maybe like, oh, I've been letting people slack, so I got to make an example out of somebody to kind of re-establish the

495
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:43.000
discipline kind of thing, or maybe, you know, as a boss or whatever, you really don't like this specific violation.

496
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Like, you just, just one of your things, you know, so you can make an example for that reason.

497
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Do you think that that's fair?

498
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
It can be.

499
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
But it's also a touchy subject.

500
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000
You tell me, I personally think, let's say I've been giving some slack and people been showing up a little bit late,

501
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:06.000
showing up a little bit late, and I'm kind of like, hey, man, you know, we need to be a little more in time and then finally on a Thursday,

502
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000
guys shows up late for the meeting, and I say, hey, you're suspended, you're grounded, you're, you know, you're going to work this weekend.

503
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
I plan to punish some hard, super hard.

504
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
That doesn't make sense, right?

505
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
It doesn't make sense.

506
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
And people say, oh, you know, I'm not good.

507
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
It's not being consistent because people have been being like, however, if I was to say, hey, guys,

508
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
check it out, build just walking in right now, and I've been letting it slide, and I'll tell you what, this is where it's getting us.

509
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
We've been later and later, and we start slacken here.

510
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
We're going to start slacken in other places.

511
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
We can't afford to slack right now.

512
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Our mission's too important.

513
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:49.000
From now on, if we're late, if you're late, showing up to this meeting or you're late to an evolution that we're about to do, I'm going to drop the hammer.

514
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
So don't be late.

515
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Is that fair?

516
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Yeah.

517
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Fair warning.

518
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Explanation has to why that's fair, in my opinion.

519
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Just going off the handle and smashing someone because you want to make an example of them, that doesn't make sense to me.

520
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Yeah.

521
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
I don't like it.

522
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
I don't do it.

523
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Yeah.

524
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.000
That makes sense.

525
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Can it be useful?

526
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Yes.

527
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:18.000
If someone, if there's a clearly delineated expectation that's been set and it gets violated for whatever reason, and you are going to crush and destroy to set an example.

528
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And actually, we're going to get to a point where he talks about that in here, there isn't example set.

529
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And that has to send a message everyone.

530
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Yeah.

531
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Can do that. I've done that with my family.

532
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Yeah.

533
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Hey, here's the line.

534
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000
If you cross it, you will remember for a very long time that you made a bad decision.

535
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Yeah.

536
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000
And my other kids, when I've done that to some of one of my kids that is made a bad decision, they all remember all of them.

537
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Yeah.

538
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
They don't want to make that mistake.

539
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Yeah.

540
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
It seems like you don't want to cross the line.

541
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
No.

542
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Not at all.

543
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Like it.

544
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
How you said, if you give them kind of ample warning, where you kind of give them the tools to make their own decision.

545
00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000
You're kind of thinking, even if you are changing a policy or whatever, you know, harsh upon the punishments all this stuff.

546
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:10.000
As long as you warn them like how you're saying that seems like fair and a huge one, which I always kind of thought was if it applies to everyone.

547
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
You know, like if if this violation, this punishment for this violation applies to everyone.

548
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Sure, it just happens to be this guy because he just happens. He's being the one.

549
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
He happens to be the one that committed the violation or whatever.

550
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
But this rule, this policy applies to everybody.

551
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Yeah.

552
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
And also when you when you explain these things, you don't blame them.

553
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
If you notice even when I just said, you know, hey guys, I've been right there.

554
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Yeah.

555
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
You don't say look, you guys have been stuck.

556
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
No, so look, I didn't make it clear why this is important.

557
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Yeah.

558
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
And therefore you guys have been, you know, I've been letting you slack.

559
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
You guys have been showing up late.

560
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
That's a problem.

561
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
We can't have that problem anymore.

562
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
So you just don't start point the fingers going to be like, yeah.

563
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
And then hammering a Polish punishment. No, not a good idea.

564
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Speaking of leadership back to the book, I believe that some men and women are born with the inherent qualities that make them good leaders.

565
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Writing to his son, John, who is a cadet at West Point in 1943,

566
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:17.000
General Eisenhower once said, the one quality that can be developed by studious reflection and practice is the leadership of men.

567
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
I agree with Ike. Leaders are not born.

568
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Leaders are made and they are made by solid effort and hard work.

569
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
So there's a little contradictory in there because he says, look, some people are born with qualities that make them a good leader,

570
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
but you can learn to be a good leader. I totally agree with that.

571
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:40.000
I've always said that some people have the qualities that make them a good leader naturally or they lot of some of them, right?

572
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Some of them are be really articulate. Some of them will be very charismatic, very dynamic, loud.

573
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Have a lot of presence. Those are all characters, except we'll differentiate in different people.

574
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
And if you have a lot of those, you're going to have a naturally easier time being a good leader.

575
00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Now, occasionally you get people that have some of those qualities, but they're idiots and those are the worst because they can get people to follow them.

576
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Even though they don't know where they're going. Those are bad situations.

577
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
But it's interesting hard work, studying, right? Studying leadership.

578
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
I, you know, today I already learned something.

579
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Need to increase my focus on honesty as a leadership quality.

580
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
But yeah, I'm always studying, always learning, and we all need to be.

581
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
That's how we're going to become a better leader.

582
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:32.000
And a lot of the studying that I did when I was growing up in the teams was just, well, I was watching and thinking about why these leaders were doing what they're doing.

583
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
What is making them do that? Good leader? Why is that? Why do we respond to that?

584
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Bad leader? Why don't we respond well to what he's doing?

585
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
I wasn't sitting there consciously thinking about it.

586
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Actually, no, in some, in some cases, I was actually consciously thinking about it.

587
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
You know, consciously thinking, wait, why is no one want to follow this guy?

588
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
How is he acting that we all want to walk away from him?

589
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Why is that happening? And then when he get a good leader, I'd say,

590
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Yeah, this, why is this guy such a good leader?

591
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.000
So yeah, I guess I did consciously do that. And study not from books, but from life to trying to learn.

592
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Yeah. And that's how you can become better.

593
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Here's a little note, too.

594
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And, and you want to talk about holding the line.

595
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
If you aren't good physical shape, forget it.

596
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
You are not going to be a good leader.

597
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Well, certainly in a military environment, that is true.

598
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Are there some civilian leaders that aren't the best shape?

599
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Yeah, there are.

600
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Would those leaders be doing a better job if they were in better physical condition?

601
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Yes, they would. It's like that thing that starting strength, coach,

602
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Rippato says, I, I post, I've never talked about it, but I posted, you know,

603
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
He's talking about how physical strength is good.

604
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
And people that say that physical strength aren't good, he says, you know,

605
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
I forget the exact quote, but he's basically saying,

606
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
I, I know physical strength is good.

607
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
And if you take someone that says the physical strength isn't good,

608
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
and it's important.

609
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
And then you add 120 pounds to their squat,

610
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
and then ask them how they're doing now.

611
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
They're going to be doing better.

612
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Yeah, they're going to be doing better.

613
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
The more you can deadlift, the better you're going to feel.

614
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
You don't feel worse when you can deadlift more.

615
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
You don't feel worse when you can squat more.

616
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
You feel better.

617
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Yeah.

618
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
What? Why is that? There's a million reasons why.

619
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Confidence, overcoming the challenge,

620
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
you're actually physically stronger.

621
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Your mental clarity goes up. So yeah, of course,

622
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
being good shape.

623
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Being good shape.

624
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
If you're worried about your health,

625
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
you're, you're not going to be able to focus on being a good leader.

626
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And in the military or in any job where that demands physical exertion,

627
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
you have to be in good shape.

628
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Otherwise, people are looking at you and you're falling apart.

629
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
You can't be falling apart on a patrol.

630
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
You can't be falling apart during a combat swimming operation.

631
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Where you, you, you, you need to swim.

632
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
You need to swim far. You're going to swim for four straight hours on a combat swim

633
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
or operation. If you're weak and you can't do that,

634
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
you think you're going to respect you.

635
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Hmm.

636
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
They're not. I'll go in the answer that question for you.

637
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Hmm.

638
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Is that kind of like the hockey coach who doesn't even know how to ice skate?

639
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.000
You know, there are coaches that have never participated in the sport that they coach and they're good.

640
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
There's, I mean, you can look at Greg Jackson who's a great mixed martial arts coach.

641
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
He's never been a mixed martial arts fighter.

642
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Yeah, but he knows how to fight though, you know?

643
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Yeah, certainly does. Yes.

644
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
But he hasn't actually fought.

645
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
So how can he be a good coach?

646
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
What about Duke Rufus?

647
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
He's never fought MMA, has he?

648
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Oh, MMA. I don't know.

649
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
He's a champion kick boxer, but how can he be such a great coach at MMA?

650
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Yeah, because he can connect the dots and stuff like that.

651
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
And of course, there's, you know, there's exceptions here,

652
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
but generally speaking, and plus you're talking about a little bit more of a broad thing like a leader.

653
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Like who are we going to like follow?

654
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm probably talking about coaches.

655
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
I mean, coaches are not participating anymore. That's why they're coaching.

656
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Yeah.

657
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
So I guess those are really stupid examples.

658
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Yeah, it's my coach's goal.

659
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Because, you know, custom auto with Mike Tyson.

660
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Obviously he wasn't getting in the ring with Mike Tyson, right?

661
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Yeah.

662
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
But he's a great coach, a fantastic coach.

663
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
One of the most, you know, one of the most respected coaches of all time.

664
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Yeah.

665
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
And the results are a little bit more like recognizable, like the less ambiguous.

666
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Like a leader's results quote unquote.

667
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Yeah.

668
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
And we're looking at leaders in the field.

669
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Like leaders in the job that are leading a group to accomplish a mission.

670
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Right.

671
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
That's different than a coach.

672
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
A coach is outside the group.

673
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Yeah.

674
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
So we're talking about someone that's in the group.

675
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Yeah.

676
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
You got to be able to maintain.

677
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
You got to be able to stay with your team physically.

678
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
And you know, it's not like you need to be the best.

679
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
I was never the fastest guy.

680
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
I was never the strongest guy.

681
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
But I wasn't going to be fallen behind on a patrol.

682
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Yeah.

683
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Because I wasn't in good shape.

684
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
That wasn't going to happen.

685
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Yeah.

686
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
And the only way that doesn't happen is you need to stay in shape.

687
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
How do you stay in shape?

688
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Got to have a discipline.

689
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Yep.

690
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Yeah.

691
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
So these questions answer themselves at some point.

692
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Maybe something like this podcast will just come on here and sit here in silence.

693
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Yep.

694
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Now speaking of.

695
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Now this is this is good that you were talking about this.

696
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Here is a heavy punishment handed out.

697
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Talking about Colonel Bob Sink, who was the leader of the 506th parachute infantry

698
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
regiment.

699
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Here we go.

700
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Back to the book.

701
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Colonel Bob Sink certainly was one of the best.

702
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
He set high standards and never compromised on those standards.

703
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000
After the parachute, the 506th parachute, parachute infantry regiment earned their

704
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
jump wings.

705
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Sink granted a 10 day furlough.

706
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Sink cautioned him men to conduct themselves appropriately.

707
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Several parachuteers reported late for duty after their furloughs expired.

708
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Sink called another regimental formation and publicly humiliated one paratrooper from

709
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000
each of his nine companies.

710
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
They called out the name of the last soldier to report to duty.

711
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
And that paratrooper was marched in front of the formation under escort.

712
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
An officer stripped him of his unit patch.

713
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Forced into unblouses boots.

714
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
And then escorted him from the field.

715
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.000
What Sink was saying was paratroopers may be elite, but they had to follow the army's rules and regulations.

716
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
I liked that.

717
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000
For some reason Sink liked me.

718
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Respected me.

719
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
He was always the man instrumental in getting me my next job.

720
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
So there's a heavy punishment.

721
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Now that's a clear message being sent.

722
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Clear message being sent.

723
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:55.000
And I bet Colonel Sink at that time weighed.

724
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
He's got three nine companies.

725
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
So he's got hundreds and hundreds of guys.

726
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Hundreds and hundreds of guys.

727
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
And he's going to make an example out of nine of them.

728
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
And he's going to be a real clear example.

729
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
And that's going to leave an impression on a thousand guys.

730
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
You know close to a thousand guys.

731
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
That might be worth it.

732
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
And he probably judged that it was worth it.

733
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Yeah.

734
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
So interesting perspective.

735
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Yeah.

736
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
I guess the question is, is that fair?

737
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000
I would say to the guys that got booted from the regiment.

738
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
I'd say their thoughts were that it was unfair.

739
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:43.000
I would say for the guys that remained in the regiment that realized that they had to maintain the standard that realize there was going to be no slack.

740
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
And that worked hard to make sure they maintain that.

741
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
And therefore we're more prepared for combat.

742
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
That's it was real fair.

743
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Right.

744
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
It's a bigger picture kind of thing.

745
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000
They were kind of the martyr.

746
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Yeah.

747
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
That gets a real big picture thing.

748
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
And who knows what kind of behind the scenes.

749
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
We would have to get some details.

750
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
If we were really going to cast judgment on that.

751
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Like, you know, maybe some of those guys were kind of slackers.

752
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Anyways.

753
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Yeah.

754
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
And the company commander was like, hey dude, yeah, we don't want this guy.

755
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
You know, let's get rid of this guy.

756
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Or you know, yeah.

757
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000
And he only took certain members of the people that missed their furlough.

758
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
He's so he's even.

759
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
That's not fair.

760
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
He only took certain members or certain people that missed their furlough.

761
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Didn't take all of them.

762
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Yeah.

763
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Just the last one to report.

764
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
We don't, we don't take that around here.

765
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000
It's an interesting dynamic.

766
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
No.

767
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
It's an interesting dynamic.

768
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
But it's definitely showing.

769
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000
I don't know that I necessarily would have done that.

770
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
I can, I might have sent my assessment.

771
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000
I probably wouldn't have.

772
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Yeah.

773
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Not one guy from each company.

774
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Maybe like the two guys that grossly violated it.

775
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
I don't think I would need to do nine.

776
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Yeah.

777
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
I guess what Colonel Sank did.

778
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Don't mess with Colonel Sank.

779
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
And that's a good thing.

780
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Little little kind of image for you to have.

781
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Don't mess with Colonel Sank.

782
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Don't mess around with the battalion.

783
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
In the regiment.

784
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
We don't play.

785
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Another leader that he talks about here is McCallough.

786
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Back to the book.

787
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000
What we liked about McCallough was that he allowed us to do our jobs.

788
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
You didn't have a lot of interference from McCallough.

789
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000
But with Taylor and command, this is another person, he told you what you needed to do here.

790
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000
He had to run everything.

791
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000
You can't do a good job if you don't have the chance to use your imagination and creativity.

792
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:42.000
In my mind, Taylor was more interested in impressing his superiors than watching out for his men.

793
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Taylor was such a contrast with British general Montgomery.

794
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000
So he talks a little bit.

795
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Okay.

796
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.000
So first of all, clearly decentralized command don't give people the clear specifics on how to do every little thing.

797
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Let them get creative.

798
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Let them come up with a solution.

799
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Perfect.

800
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Boom.

801
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Over and over again.

802
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Why do we hear it over and over again?

803
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Because it's right.

804
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Because it's right.

805
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
That's why we hear it over and over again.

806
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Now we talk about the famous British general Montgomery Monti who always gets portrayed a little bit stiff and a little bit British.

807
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Right.

808
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
And he says in here that the writers don't didn't know him.

809
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Didn't see him on the battlefield.

810
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Didn't see what he was like.

811
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000
And here's what he says.

812
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Here's what Dickwinner said about Montgomery.

813
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Back to the book Montgomery was the real deal.

814
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:39.000
I saw him on a number of occasions and he always impressed me as a commander who lived the lifestyle that was beyond reproach for his staff to follow.

815
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
He set the example.

816
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
He addressed every division that was scheduled to participate in the invasion.

817
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
He called us together and had every soldier take off his helmet.

818
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000
So he could see the troops better.

819
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Yeah.

820
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000
They're going around and

821
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000
and talking to every single division.

822
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000
And then say hey boys, take off your helmets.

823
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
I want to see your face is before you roll.

824
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
It's legit.

825
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Props.

826
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
There's this book a lot of this books about Self Discipline.

827
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Even this part right here back to the book.

828
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Self discipline keeps you doing your job.

829
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Without it you lose your pride.

830
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:30.52
pride and forget the importance of self-respect and the eyes of your fellow men. Pride keeps you going on.

831
00:54:31.16 --> 00:54:37.96
This is what I feared I would lose the loss of the will to measure up to my men. So once you say,

832
00:54:37.96 --> 00:54:44.04
you know what, I don't care what my guys think anymore. You've lost it, right? Mm-hmm. If I say

833
00:54:44.04 --> 00:54:48.04
look, I don't care what the guys think of me. Think of what a driving force it is to have your team

834
00:54:48.04 --> 00:54:52.60
looking at you and saying, I'm going to make sure these guys respect me and I'm proud of what I'm

835
00:54:52.60 --> 00:54:57.96
doing compared to, I don't care what I knew and thanks to me anymore. You can see when this happens to

836
00:54:57.96 --> 00:55:04.60
people, I'm not just in the military or business organization, but in life, in life. At a certain point,

837
00:55:04.60 --> 00:55:09.08
you see a bomb in the street. At a certain point, that bomb said, you know what, I don't care when

838
00:55:09.08 --> 00:55:13.96
anyone thinks of me anymore. Yeah. I don't care what my family thinks. Me, I don't care what the society thinks

839
00:55:13.96 --> 00:55:19.40
of me. Yeah. Of course, I'm not talking on every single bomb, but a lot of them. Yeah, that's how you

840
00:55:19.40 --> 00:55:26.28
know, I don't care. Generally the thing. And the way soon as you see that, you can imagine that,

841
00:55:26.28 --> 00:55:29.88
that's just like a life thing, right? Yeah. If you go through life and you don't care what

842
00:55:29.88 --> 00:55:33.96
anyone else thinks, which is a contradiction for me, right? Because I'll say all the time like,

843
00:55:33.96 --> 00:55:39.000
I don't care what people think. Yeah. But that's just to agree. Like you and it's obvious,

844
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.84
and just put a little bit of thought into you don't care about what people think well as it appears.

845
00:55:42.84 --> 00:55:48.04
You don't care what people think on a superficial level, you know, on a profound level, you do.

846
00:55:48.04 --> 00:55:53.88
That's why you're, you know, that's why party your morality is like, you know, fairness doing the

847
00:55:53.88 --> 00:56:01.48
right thing, all this discipline, stuff. It's for you. But in regards to social cues and all these

848
00:56:01.48 --> 00:56:06.60
things like that, that's beneficial to your success, the function and the society. Yeah, and I've said

849
00:56:06.60 --> 00:56:11.08
this before, like, about the sealed teams and me being in the sealed teams. And I had this completely

850
00:56:11.08 --> 00:56:17.000
had this attitude. I don't care, like, for instance, I don't care what happens. Like, I don't care if

851
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.84
I get fired. I'm going to do the right thing. I don't care. I don't care what they think of me. And

852
00:56:20.84 --> 00:56:25.88
at the same thing, at the same time, there's nothing that was more important to me than my reputation

853
00:56:25.88 --> 00:56:30.12
of the sealed teams. I don't want, you know, if if something was going to give you a bad

854
00:56:30.12 --> 00:56:34.52
reputation, like what we just talked about, if you fall out of a patrol as a leader or as anyone.

855
00:56:34.52 --> 00:56:39.000
Like, if you fall out of a patrol, you're going to no one's ever going to forget it in the sealed

856
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.88
teams. If you're too weak to do something, you're going to be remembered by that forever. And that,

857
00:56:43.88 --> 00:56:49.48
I didn't want that ever. It's a be like, oh, Jocco did this. Jocco couldn't finish patrol. Jocco was a

858
00:56:49.48 --> 00:56:55.08
bad leader, Jocco. I didn't want that to be the reality. Yeah. And so therefore you work hard. You

859
00:56:55.08 --> 00:57:01.48
stay in shape. You do your best all the time. Yeah. And that drives you. Yeah. But at the same time,

860
00:57:02.60 --> 00:57:08.28
I wasn't saying, oh, I, I'm concerned what my boss thinks of me. So I'm going to act a certain way.

861
00:57:08.28 --> 00:57:15.24
No, I was trying to do the right thing for the teams. Right. The same thing. No, like these are all

862
00:57:15.24 --> 00:57:20.92
teams. Those are all fundamental things. Yeah. You know, we're balanced. So to say, look,

863
00:57:22.28 --> 00:57:27.72
I don't care if I get promoted, but I care more than anything about my job. You know,

864
00:57:27.72 --> 00:57:32.04
I mean, yeah, and that definitely was my attitude. That definitely was my attitude. My whole

865
00:57:32.04 --> 00:57:35.96
time all's in the military. Look, I'm, I'm going to do the best job I can. I'm not doing it to get

866
00:57:35.96 --> 00:57:42.60
promoted. I'm not doing it for that reason. Yeah. But I am part of it. Absolutely doing it to have

867
00:57:42.60 --> 00:57:47.96
the respect of my peers and my brothers and the teams. Right. You rep, you know, rep, you hear the

868
00:57:47.96 --> 00:57:51.96
old time and reputations, everything in the field teams. Because it's a small group of people. You know,

869
00:57:51.96 --> 00:57:55.48
you have an accident on discharge with your weapon. Everybody knows about it. And they're going to

870
00:57:55.48 --> 00:57:59.48
know about it forever. If you, if you remain on the teams for whatever reason, after you have an

871
00:57:59.48 --> 00:58:06.44
accident with this charge, everyone's going to know it from there on out. And it's not fun. That's

872
00:58:06.44 --> 00:58:11.08
where we got Matt and Jacked up nicknames in the seal. Because you're going to get nicknamed after

873
00:58:11.08 --> 00:58:17.24
your lowest point in your life. Biggest mistake is what you're going to get nicknamed or your biggest

874
00:58:17.24 --> 00:58:25.56
yeah. Like there was a guy and his nickname was Bush and he's a great dude. The nickname was Bush.

875
00:58:25.56 --> 00:58:29.72
He had nothing to do with the last name. But anyways, long story short, when he was a new guy.

876
00:58:29.72 --> 00:58:33.80
And I, I knew him. This is 15 years later. I found this out. He's so he'd been in the

877
00:58:33.80 --> 00:58:41.000
sealed teams for 15 years. I know him as Bush the whole time. And he was parachuting. Brand new guy

878
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.16
showed up the team. They're like, hey, you're going jump today. Okay. It gets into aircraft jumps.

879
00:58:45.16 --> 00:58:50.60
And he lands. Foonal fall. You can't even steer these brown parachutes. You can't barely

880
00:58:50.60 --> 00:58:55.80
stare him. He lands in a bush with like thorns in it. Right. And I guess it looks pretty funny. And

881
00:58:55.80 --> 00:59:02.92
from there on. Yeah. What's his name? Bush. Yeah. So you're going to get a name like that. But that's

882
00:59:02.92 --> 00:59:06.60
that's a really easy example. Because everybody knows that's just funny. It was more of a funny

883
00:59:06.60 --> 00:59:10.44
thing. If you something funny happens to you, you might get that nickname too. Like if you get

884
00:59:11.40 --> 00:59:18.60
pepper sprayed by the cops, you might have the nickname pepper. Which I like the direct. It is.

885
00:59:18.60 --> 00:59:21.40
Yeah. There's no sense in playing around. What else do you get to call some of that

886
00:59:21.40 --> 00:59:25.08
gets pepper sprayed by the cops or their new guy? You're going to call him pepper. You're calling

887
00:59:25.08 --> 00:59:29.88
when I hear something. When I. Yeah. You know, because you guys get all watery. You're not

888
00:59:29.88 --> 00:59:35.000
you're not going to charge a nickname. When we were your guy. But you thought his name was his name was

889
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.60
Al. Yeah. But it was Al 50 Cal. Not even his name. Yeah. But he was in big Al 50 Cal.

890
00:59:40.60 --> 00:59:51.48
Yeah. Yeah. Morphs. That's awesome. So that's why you have this weird dichotomy that's pulling

891
00:59:51.48 --> 00:59:57.32
it to you is just to you're looking at your your friends, your peers in this in a relationship

892
00:59:57.32 --> 01:00:01.16
position. It's your men. You're looking at your men saying, hey, I don't want to let these guys down.

893
01:00:01.16 --> 01:00:07.64
I don't want them to view me as weak. Weeks. Bad word. But I guess it's the word I'm looking for.

894
01:00:07.64 --> 01:00:11.56
You know, I'm not that I not that I want to maintain the image of strength because part of

895
01:00:11.56 --> 01:00:16.20
maintaining the image of strength is by showing weakness. Right. Being like, I just said this all

896
01:00:16.20 --> 01:00:21.40
time. Hey, I don't know how to do this. Hey, can you me a suggestion? I'm not talking about that type of thing.

897
01:00:21.40 --> 01:00:31.24
I'm talking about. We physical weakness. Physical and mental toughness or physical mental weakness.

898
01:00:31.24 --> 01:00:34.92
Right. That's a lot different than hey, I don't understand how to do something or it's a lot

899
01:00:34.92 --> 01:00:39.24
different than humility. You can you can want to show you can want to maintain strength.

900
01:00:39.80 --> 01:00:46.52
But still have humility for sure. Yeah. Well, I know all kinds. I mean, I know tons of guys

901
01:00:46.92 --> 01:00:52.36
that are completely humble, but they're the toughest bastard you ever want. No mentally and physically.

902
01:00:52.36 --> 01:00:56.60
So I'm not talking about I need to be strong. Strong. Strong within everyone. No, I'm not talking

903
01:00:56.60 --> 01:01:00.20
about that at all. I'm talking about you physical and mental toughness you have to have. And if you don't

904
01:01:00.20 --> 01:01:09.88
have them as a leader, could be problematic. Watch out for it. Back to the book, the big thing I

905
01:01:09.88 --> 01:01:14.36
derived from combat was the necessity of maintaining discipline. Discipline in our troops was

906
01:01:15.08 --> 01:01:20.44
discipline in our troops and getting the job done in combat. So clearly, disciplines big part

907
01:01:20.44 --> 01:01:29.16
of what we're talking about here. G, I wonder why. Now, this is talking another little aspect

908
01:01:29.16 --> 01:01:34.20
that you know, I don't talk about this a lot. I think it's inherent in a lot of things that I say,

909
01:01:35.32 --> 01:01:39.16
but it's not something that I don't use this word a lot. And again, I think I need to use it more

910
01:01:39.16 --> 01:01:45.80
back to the book, character revolves around doing the right thing all the time.

911
01:01:45.80 --> 01:01:54.60
Character implies daily choices of right over wrong. The cadet prayer at West Point

912
01:01:54.60 --> 01:02:02.04
says cadet strive to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong and never to be content

913
01:02:02.04 --> 01:02:10.60
with a half truth when the whole can be one. That gets to the heart of character. I would add

914
01:02:10.60 --> 01:02:17.40
that it is easier to do the right thing when everyone is looking. It is more difficult to do

915
01:02:17.40 --> 01:02:26.20
what you should do when you are alone. I like to think of character as every other virtue

916
01:02:26.76 --> 01:02:33.72
at the breaking point. So character doing the right thing, doing the right thing in all times,

917
01:02:34.44 --> 01:02:44.12
doing the right thing when you're alone. Back to the book, war doesn't alter character.

918
01:02:44.12 --> 01:02:53.72
War merely brings out the best that an individual has to offer. Unfortunately, it also brings

919
01:02:53.72 --> 01:03:01.40
forth the worst in some men. If anything, war exposes the best and worst of those who are

920
01:03:01.40 --> 01:03:08.36
called the fight. I know of no man who lacked character and peace and then discovered

921
01:03:08.36 --> 01:03:15.72
character in combat. I've said this same type of thing before, especially

922
01:03:18.12 --> 01:03:24.60
we see on deployment as pressure starts to build on people. You start seeing people go into

923
01:03:24.60 --> 01:03:28.84
directions. That's what we'd say. This character would start to reveal itself. They either get

924
01:03:29.88 --> 01:03:35.72
very, they'd rise to the occasion or they would not. They'd go in the other direction and become

925
01:03:35.72 --> 01:03:42.04
worse. Their character would become worse or their character would become better. That's what I've

926
01:03:42.04 --> 01:03:49.88
seen. The same thing we talk about people that have maybe have a hard time dealing with war.

927
01:03:49.88 --> 01:03:58.92
A lot of times there are some pre-existing issues that the war inflames. If you take someone that

928
01:03:58.92 --> 01:04:05.72
doesn't have pre-existing issues or maybe has a positive spin on things, that becomes more positive.

929
01:04:05.72 --> 01:04:09.80
It's very, and there's a bunch of people in the middle. Some of the guys that I knew that really

930
01:04:09.80 --> 01:04:18.12
had a hard time, they had issues going in. They had problems, some issues going in to the situation,

931
01:04:18.12 --> 01:04:24.04
going into war and those problems get exacerbated by the pressure and the stress of combat.

932
01:04:24.04 --> 01:04:32.28
We need to watch out for that one. I think war is more of an amplifier that a creator.

933
01:04:32.28 --> 01:04:37.64
I think it amplifies good character. I think it amplifies bad character. I think it amplifies

934
01:04:37.64 --> 01:04:51.80
issues in either direction. It's a powerful element to add into people's lives. This big

935
01:04:51.80 --> 01:05:03.32
intense piece. One of the things that this book captures is these letters. He had a pen pal,

936
01:05:04.52 --> 01:05:13.72
a female pen pal when he was at war. Her name is Diaet Alman. One of the things is that he,

937
01:05:13.72 --> 01:05:17.96
he's a capture of these letters. Some of the letters parts of some of the letters are published

938
01:05:17.96 --> 01:05:23.000
in here. Here's one of them back to the book first, and most important. I've got my own conscience

939
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.84
to answer to. Next, my parents, and then I am an officer in the US Army. I am damn proud of it,

940
01:05:30.84 --> 01:05:36.68
and with the rank and position I hold. I wouldn't think of doing anything to bring

941
01:05:36.68 --> 01:05:43.64
discredit to my outfit. My parachute for boots, wings, the airborne patch, or the US Army.

942
01:05:43.64 --> 01:05:49.96
Good morale within an outfit is usually reflected by good conduct away from it.

943
01:05:51.16 --> 01:05:57.96
That sounds like an idealistic high school kid. I know, but that's it. That's how I feel.

944
01:06:01.72 --> 01:06:11.16
So he took that stuff very, very seriously. And I remember, I remember, I'm going to do

945
01:06:11.16 --> 01:06:21.24
free war. I was in my third putoon. And the new guys, who are all my brothers now, I mean,

946
01:06:21.24 --> 01:06:25.32
these are just mugs, but they were new guys, and we were the senior older guys, right?

947
01:06:25.32 --> 01:06:31.32
Because we've been in the teams for like a couple of years. And something happened,

948
01:06:32.36 --> 01:06:40.52
and we gave like a, like, a, like, hey guys, don't, don't ever make the putoon look bad. Like,

949
01:06:40.52 --> 01:06:43.40
no matter what, you don't make the putoon look bad. That's not allowed.

950
01:06:43.40 --> 01:06:49.88
The putoon comes first above everything. And this one, oh, I just remember,

951
01:06:49.88 --> 01:06:55.88
say, but then one guy made the putoon look bad and he had to pay for it. But that's the attitude.

952
01:06:55.88 --> 01:07:00.12
The attitude is like, look, you don't make the putoon look bad. You don't make the teams look bad.

953
01:07:00.12 --> 01:07:04.76
We didn't really, we weren't too concerned with the navy back then. We didn't really even feel like,

954
01:07:04.76 --> 01:07:07.80
when I was that young and the shield teams, we weren't even thinking about the big navy.

955
01:07:07.80 --> 01:07:15.64
We barely even recognized it. We were in the teams. It's more, it's as the teams became bigger

956
01:07:15.64 --> 01:07:21.08
and more prevalent. We connected more with the big navy. When I was a new guy in the suit,

957
01:07:21.08 --> 01:07:26.28
when I was in the suit, it was a young guy in the 90s. We were pretty much on our own. So I wasn't,

958
01:07:26.28 --> 01:07:29.40
I basically, I wasn't like sitting there thinking, I need to protect the reputation of the navy.

959
01:07:29.40 --> 01:07:35.000
I didn't care. I wouldn't now. I got an old ride, did. But back in the day, it was like, hey,

960
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.08
the putoon. And I was at team one at the time and team one. You know, make team one look bad. What are you doing?

961
01:07:41.08 --> 01:07:47.000
Don't make this putoon look bad. You just did that. Yeah. Now you have to pay for that.

962
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:56.60
Punishment will be delivered at this time. Okay, and it was. That's an unfortunate situation.

963
01:07:56.60 --> 01:08:01.72
You know, these things just happened. So are we not going into what the punishment was that day?

964
01:08:01.72 --> 01:08:09.80
The punishment. The punishment was, I'll tell you what the punishment was.

965
01:08:09.80 --> 01:08:14.76
Jockel punishment. The punishment was, I am going to strike you two times in the face with an open hand.

966
01:08:14.76 --> 01:08:20.36
That's your punishment. Or we're going to fight. Which one do you want? That was the punishment.

967
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.76
He in this guy was like, I'll take the two. Yeah. And I was like, Roger that. And it was a little bit more

968
01:08:26.76 --> 01:08:31.56
tension than that. You know? Yeah, fully. That's because he was going to like bow it up a little bit. Yeah.

969
01:08:31.56 --> 01:08:37.48
And I was like, oh, if you want to get it on, we'll get it on. Yeah. And then. And you know, it's funny because these guys,

970
01:08:37.48 --> 01:08:45.000
this group of guys who is, they were, they were all guys just trying to get after it and be good team guys. But we were just crazy.

971
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.000
You know, at this point in the teams was literally everything in my life. So when I was like mad

972
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.96
about disrespecting or making the little tune look bad, it like hurt me. I was that crazy

973
01:08:58.68 --> 01:09:02.52
that I just didn't want the little tune look bad. You know, and you did something that made the

974
01:09:02.52 --> 01:09:09.24
little tune look bad. It bothered me. It really truly bothered me. You made something that made team one look.

975
01:09:09.24 --> 01:09:14.84
I mean, I had been there. You know, since I was a kid and it was everything to me. And so when you

976
01:09:14.84 --> 01:09:21.56
didn't, when you made us look bad, I wasn't happy. And not just I wasn't happy because I was a jerk or I

977
01:09:21.56 --> 01:09:26.20
wasn't that because I was a being a jerk at the time. But talking these guys, you know years later,

978
01:09:26.20 --> 01:09:30.76
you talk these guys. They're like, yeah, that guy in particular is like, I hated going to work. I hated

979
01:09:30.76 --> 01:09:38.12
you guys. And I was like, yeah, I'm sorry. You know, and then they'll be like, but I'm glad it was like that.

980
01:09:38.12 --> 01:09:42.68
Because everybody has that feeling. It was the old schools. Like with the old breed, you know,

981
01:09:42.68 --> 01:09:46.92
hey, that's the way it is. This is the real delight. We don't make the between look bad. We make the

982
01:09:46.92 --> 01:09:51.88
between look good. We work hard. That's what we do. It was like a little gang. Yeah, that's all it was.

983
01:09:52.52 --> 01:09:56.52
Yeah, that's crazy. Those two choices because they're like, they're just different. Because some

984
01:09:56.52 --> 01:10:02.28
people would rather go do the fight because, you know, at least they kind of go now and swing in kind of

985
01:10:02.28 --> 01:10:09.80
attitude. But the potential for damage is way more annoying. You know, same, but and then I agree with you.

986
01:10:09.80 --> 01:10:13.96
And you could see where you could make a case for both of those selections. But there's also something

987
01:10:13.96 --> 01:10:19.08
called it's like, I'll take two hits to the face. You open hand cool. I'm a man. I screwed up. I think that's

988
01:10:19.08 --> 01:10:27.16
the reason I respected it was because it was like, yeah, I did screw up. Right. So I'll just take it. I deserve punishment.

989
01:10:27.16 --> 01:10:32.36
Give it to me. Yeah. And that was that. Yeah. Well, that didn't we move on. No factor. Yeah,

990
01:10:32.36 --> 01:10:38.20
technically the two to the face are is way easier because it's way quicker. You, you know, you know,

991
01:10:38.20 --> 01:10:43.32
what to expect kind of that. I mean, unless you're scared of like, oh, hitting your head and dying or

992
01:10:43.32 --> 01:10:48.28
some, you know, some off the end. They're open hand. Yeah. See, so you're not going to knock anybody out

993
01:10:48.28 --> 01:10:53.32
with the open hand. Yeah. Well, I could be usually you're not, you know, maybe I could. I'm just kidding.

994
01:10:53.32 --> 01:10:58.52
But yeah. So a lot of that is like that. How you say you're kind of building some tension with it. It's like

995
01:10:58.52 --> 01:11:03.72
that's a big part of the punishment as well. That's psychological torture. Yeah. And this also

996
01:11:03.72 --> 01:11:09.24
reveals my own personal image. Right. These are, this is, it like seriously. This is, when I'm thinking

997
01:11:09.24 --> 01:11:16.20
about it, this is just an amateur, you know, I was probably 22 years old, maybe 23 years old, but

998
01:11:16.20 --> 01:11:22.52
you know, young and immature and not getting the best guidance, not understanding things, not

999
01:11:22.52 --> 01:11:27.000
understanding that I wasn't helping build a cohesive unit, not understanding that this guy's

1000
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.92
probably thinking, oh, I don't want to help him. And you know what I mean? It wasn't smart. I'm not,

1001
01:11:30.92 --> 01:11:34.60
I'm not trying to say that this stuff was smart. I'm telling you the reality of the way it was.

1002
01:11:34.60 --> 01:11:41.40
And the way it was in my head was, hey, this is my life. Yeah. This is your plateau. And I know it's,

1003
01:11:41.40 --> 01:11:47.32
it sounds crazy. This is your plateau that we're in is my whole life. And I actually don't care about

1004
01:11:47.32 --> 01:11:52.12
anything else. Mind you, this is in the 90s. There's no war going on. I'm just a young,

1005
01:11:52.76 --> 01:11:58.84
crazy kid and the only thing I know and the only thing I care about is the seal teams. And you know,

1006
01:11:58.84 --> 01:12:05.08
you make the other, the two look bad. This pollton is my life. And you just made us look bad. And I,

1007
01:12:05.08 --> 01:12:12.12
I can't stand that. And I don't want it to be that way. So young immature me, what do I do?

1008
01:12:12.12 --> 01:12:16.92
Hey, there's gotta be punishment. You know, and that's kind of the attitude we had. And

1009
01:12:19.56 --> 01:12:24.28
there are some benefits to it. But the, you know, it's our way, if I would love to go back and be a

1010
01:12:24.28 --> 01:12:28.92
better mentor and be like, hey, man, this is the mistake you made. You know, we need to make,

1011
01:12:28.92 --> 01:12:35.16
you know, I would love to do that. But you can't, you're dumb. I was a young, dumb kid that was raised

1012
01:12:35.16 --> 01:12:39.96
that way by the way as well. That's how we were raised. Yeah. And there are some benefits to it.

1013
01:12:39.96 --> 01:12:44.84
And like I said, even those guys that did pollton's with me when I was quote unquote an old guy,

1014
01:12:44.84 --> 01:12:49.000
even though we were nothing, we'd never been to combat. We were meaningless. But we had a couple

1015
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.92
more years in the suit team. So therefore, you're an old guy and the new guys are anyone with with no

1016
01:12:54.92 --> 01:13:00.36
deployments, which is actually pathetic in its own right. Because the term in the suit teams

1017
01:13:01.24 --> 01:13:07.16
being, oh, you're a new guy, that was from guys that were in Vietnam that you hadn't been in combat.

1018
01:13:07.16 --> 01:13:13.08
Yeah. So you're a new boy. You're a cherry boy. So guess what? I was a cherry boy for 13 years

1019
01:13:13.08 --> 01:13:16.28
because I never shot my weapon at the end of the end. I didn't been in combat until I went to my

1020
01:13:16.28 --> 01:13:21.56
first deployment to Iraq. So there's actually from that perspective it's embarrassing because here I was

1021
01:13:21.56 --> 01:13:25.72
big, you know, I'm an old guy. I wasn't an old guy. And they were going to combat before. One of my

1022
01:13:25.72 --> 01:13:31.48
talking about. Yeah. But you, you, you take what you had at the time, which was this organization,

1023
01:13:31.48 --> 01:13:37.96
the seal teams, my platoon. And again, you can't, I can't describe really how important the seal

1024
01:13:37.96 --> 01:13:43.24
platoon was to me. It was, well, let me put it this way. It was my whole life. There you go.

1025
01:13:43.24 --> 01:13:48.12
What did I do when I woke up in the morning went in, went into work, worked out with my seal platoon mates.

1026
01:13:48.12 --> 01:13:52.68
What do we do? Then we worked all day. What do we do for lunch? We ate together. What do we do at night?

1027
01:13:52.68 --> 01:13:56.28
We went and got dinner. What do we do after that? We went and had drinks. What do we do after that?

1028
01:13:56.28 --> 01:13:59.64
We hung out all night. What do we do after that? We went to sleep, woke up and did the same thing

1029
01:13:59.64 --> 01:14:07.24
at day after day. That was my family. And you just have this passion for your family. And you,

1030
01:14:07.24 --> 01:14:12.36
it just meant, it was the most important thing in the world to me for my whole adult life. But when you take

1031
01:14:12.36 --> 01:14:19.40
that and you put that on a young kid. And you know, everyone's like, oh, yeah, Jockel's, he's a big

1032
01:14:19.40 --> 01:14:25.08
reader. I wasn't reading anything back then. I was reading the platoon handbook, right? I wasn't reading.

1033
01:14:26.44 --> 01:14:32.04
I wasn't reading Shakespeare. Sure. Yeah. I wasn't doing it high school. I wasn't paying

1034
01:14:32.04 --> 01:14:36.36
attention during high school. I was wanting to be a command-up. I was running through the woods,

1035
01:14:36.36 --> 01:14:43.80
pretending I had a machine gun. So you take that kid and you put him in a situation where the

1036
01:14:43.80 --> 01:14:51.88
thing that he cares about the most has been. Scorn, violated, or scored. He's going to try and handle it.

1037
01:14:51.88 --> 01:14:56.28
Yeah. To the best of his abilities. Start slapping people again. Not proud of it, but occasionally

1038
01:14:56.28 --> 01:15:01.96
some people that slapped around. Yeah, that's how though. You know, when you're basic young,

1039
01:15:01.96 --> 01:15:07.40
basic guy, you're going to handle things in a young, basic kind of way? Yeah. Yeah, whatever. It's caveman.

1040
01:15:07.40 --> 01:15:13.16
Yes, caveman scenario. There you go. And the other thing is, and you know, those guys that were in

1041
01:15:13.16 --> 01:15:18.36
those early platoons, when I was like a set of quote unquote, lears later. They're like, yeah,

1042
01:15:18.36 --> 01:15:23.40
that was awesome. So glad I got raised that way. They're proud of it. Yeah. You know, but at the same time,

1043
01:15:23.40 --> 01:15:34.12
you, you, when I look back on it, I know I was not a good leader, right? But any stretch. Yeah,

1044
01:15:34.12 --> 01:15:38.44
that's kind of like when I look at my old videos, you know, at the time, like, yeah, they were dope.

1045
01:15:38.44 --> 01:15:43.000
You know, but you're like, you just know better ways now. You know, you're just better now.

1046
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.16
Yeah, you know, I can say 2020 when I'm. Yeah, and then the other thing you got to be careful of

1047
01:15:47.16 --> 01:15:54.12
is setting the, like, let's say I was in a seal platoon right now. And now I'm going to set the bar so high

1048
01:15:54.12 --> 01:15:59.48
that I've lose track of the, lose vision of the fact that like, hey, the guy that I'm trying to convince

1049
01:15:59.48 --> 01:16:03.32
right now is a 23 year old thing and the most important thing in his world is this is 20.

1050
01:16:04.36 --> 01:16:08.04
Like I was talking to someone the other day and I was going to remember what seal platoon, what

1051
01:16:08.04 --> 01:16:12.52
the phonetic letter of a certain seal platoon I was in at a certain time. I was like, after you what

1052
01:16:12.52 --> 01:16:19.56
platoon I was and to me at the time when we were in those seal platoons that letter of that

1053
01:16:19.56 --> 01:16:25.96
phonetic alphabet we were in alpha platoon. That was it. And now I look back and it's like, oh,

1054
01:16:25.96 --> 01:16:31.000
yeah, what platoon was that? Because as I matured and as I saw the rest of the world, I realized that

1055
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.36
even though a seal platoon is very important and certainly it's the most important thing when you're in it.

1056
01:16:34.76 --> 01:16:39.64
When you're in a task unit or your overseas and there's multiple people running around and

1057
01:16:39.64 --> 01:16:47.64
there's huge missions going, you you open your mind gets opened up and you see more and the

1058
01:16:47.64 --> 01:16:54.20
little thing that you used to be so engulfed in your head becomes, becomes less. That's all there

1059
01:16:54.20 --> 01:16:59.64
is to it. Now I'm telling you, guys, in the seal platoon there's no better job. It gets the best thing

1060
01:16:59.64 --> 01:17:04.76
in the world and I'm sure, you know, I never served in a Marine Corps infantry platoon or in an

1061
01:17:04.76 --> 01:17:10.68
army, US Army and Ptupatumba. I saw them. I saw what they were like and they have that same

1062
01:17:12.04 --> 01:17:19.48
bond that you get from being in those tough units. So there's something very cool about that

1063
01:17:19.48 --> 01:17:25.72
about being a grunt. Which is what you are in the seal teams. You might think on the special operations

1064
01:17:25.72 --> 01:17:33.08
or whatever you're a grunt. You carry a machine gun. And you do hard things. That's what being a grunt is.

1065
01:17:33.08 --> 01:17:41.72
You're doing hard things. You're carrying a bunch of weight around. Love those days. Love those days.

1066
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:55.32
So I just want to be back in the seal team. Yeah, so fast. So awesome. So awesome. So meaningful.

1067
01:17:55.88 --> 01:17:59.56
I would have fought you. Yeah, you should get it. Yeah, yeah. It would have been what happened.

1068
01:17:59.56 --> 01:18:08.28
You know what would have happened. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That was one of the good things about

1069
01:18:08.28 --> 01:18:13.32
knowing a little tiny bit of jujitsu, which I actually knew a little bit. Yeah, that was enough.

1070
01:18:13.32 --> 01:18:16.04
Yeah, you can offer the fight guys with, you know, with the combat industry.

1071
01:18:16.04 --> 01:18:18.52
Because what if you offer the fight them and they kick your ass. You're like dang,

1072
01:18:18.52 --> 01:18:22.60
you might not backfired. And here's the thing. They didn't know any better. All they thought was,

1073
01:18:22.60 --> 01:18:27.40
they didn't, I don't think I ever said like, I know jujitsu and you don't. But it was just I was so

1074
01:18:27.40 --> 01:18:31.24
confident. Like, oh, I actually know this and I know that I can choke this dude.

1075
01:18:31.24 --> 01:18:34.84
Then they just said, you know what, this guy's probably going to kick my ass. Yeah. And the weird

1076
01:18:34.84 --> 01:18:38.76
thing is there's probably guys along the way that could have kicked my ass. You know, some kid that

1077
01:18:38.76 --> 01:18:43.40
wrestled in high school, we all double leg boom. And now I'm slammed on the ground and getting

1078
01:18:43.40 --> 01:18:47.80
punched in the head. I don't, I can't, you know, it's less than not learned. Yeah, less than not learned.

1079
01:18:48.36 --> 01:18:54.68
I'm lucky that never happened. So check. All right.

1080
01:18:54.68 --> 01:19:02.12
Here we're talking about, so I just was talking about this is interesting. So I was just talking

1081
01:19:02.12 --> 01:19:07.000
about mental strength and physical strength. Well, here we go. Back to the book, Mori

1082
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:13.88
Current Courage is a far rare commodity than physical courage. In that I agree with Paton. I have

1083
01:19:13.88 --> 01:19:18.68
known many officers who were physically brave, but who did not have the intestinal fortitude to

1084
01:19:18.68 --> 01:19:25.48
organize the chaos around them. Those officers who were the most vocal about what they were going

1085
01:19:25.48 --> 01:19:33.000
to do to the enemy, often were the first to fall apart when the chips were down. Fear is not only

1086
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:40.36
debilitating, but its existence also destroys the cohesion of a command. It is the responsibility

1087
01:19:40.36 --> 01:19:45.40
of a commander to identify the limits of courage, break the paralysis of fear, and motivate

1088
01:19:45.40 --> 01:19:55.24
his soldiers to continue with the mission. Courage Conqueror's fear. I like just that part, and I

1089
01:19:55.24 --> 01:19:59.000
don't think I did this in helmet for my pillow. There was a part in helmet for my pillow that I

1090
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.84
pulled out, and I was talking to one of my seal buddies, and I was, because he listened to it. Yeah,

1091
01:20:02.84 --> 01:20:07.000
I was telling him this one part that I didn't put in the podcast. And I sent him a picture of it

1092
01:20:07.80 --> 01:20:11.96
from the book, this little paragraph. But it's basically one of the instructors, one of the

1093
01:20:11.96 --> 01:20:17.48
drone structures was all yelling about or going to kill and blah, blah, blah, and then he says,

1094
01:20:17.48 --> 01:20:23.40
yeah, the next time I saw him, we were in, you know, on island in the fight, and he was getting

1095
01:20:23.40 --> 01:20:28.68
taken away after breaking down. So this is what he's saying here. A lot of guys are going to

1096
01:20:28.68 --> 01:20:33.56
allow us to about what they're going to do to the enemy. Yeah, okay. You're talking to a big game,

1097
01:20:33.56 --> 01:20:37.96
you know, but what's really good to say that happen? You know what else that happens? UFC. Yeah.

1098
01:20:37.96 --> 01:20:43.56
Right. MMA it happens. Yeah. I'm going to come to crush that guy and the other guys say they're

1099
01:20:43.56 --> 01:20:48.60
going to, okay, bring it. Yeah. Or he's in the locker room like explaining to all these teammates. Yeah,

1100
01:20:48.60 --> 01:20:52.20
I'll just, I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that. And it's almost like, yeah, it's weird.

1101
01:20:52.20 --> 01:20:56.36
Trying to, they're trying to convince themselves. Yeah. So that's what that's what's going on here.

1102
01:20:56.36 --> 01:21:00.60
Same thing. Right. Some of them trying to convince themselves. They're not confident in themselves.

1103
01:21:00.60 --> 01:21:06.92
Yeah. Back to the book. I suspect every soldier at one time or another experiences a degree of fear.

1104
01:21:07.88 --> 01:21:13.48
Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the willingness to rise above fear and do the

1105
01:21:13.48 --> 01:21:21.32
things you know need to be accomplished. All soldiers hope that they will measure up the first time

1106
01:21:21.32 --> 01:21:26.92
they get into a fight. I certainly was no exception, but I believe I had prepared myself very well

1107
01:21:26.92 --> 01:21:34.20
that once I came under fire, I knew instinctively what needed to be done. I think I was more

1108
01:21:34.20 --> 01:21:41.08
apprehensive particularly before D-Day than I was afraid. Maybe apprehension is the first stage of

1109
01:21:41.08 --> 01:21:47.56
fear. I'm not really sure. You have to remember that easy company was an elite unit as we're all

1110
01:21:47.56 --> 01:21:53.48
territories. We had trained for nearly two years before we jumped into Normandy. I think I saw

1111
01:21:53.48 --> 01:22:01.64
far more excitement in the eyes of my men than I did fear. After break-art, we felt as if we were

1112
01:22:01.64 --> 01:22:13.96
seasoned veterans even though we knew worst days were ahead. That apprehension and definitely my first

1113
01:22:13.96 --> 01:22:22.60
deployment to Iraq when you had all these guys grow. The guys were so fired up to get into due real

1114
01:22:22.60 --> 01:22:29.32
missions and get after it that I think it was much more excitement than it was fear. Especially in the

1115
01:22:29.32 --> 01:22:33.56
beginning and at the beginning you know there was a lot of casualties going on. We were kind of dominating

1116
01:22:34.60 --> 01:22:40.28
and you know even shown up to her body same thing. Guys like sign me up what mission I'm going

1117
01:22:40.28 --> 01:22:45.96
to do. And the more you spend time in that and the more you realize what the threat is and

1118
01:22:45.96 --> 01:22:50.28
you start losing guys or having guys get wounded that's when you start saying okay wait a second.

1119
01:22:51.08 --> 01:22:56.44
I'm not sure I want to die today and then guys got to overcome that on a daily basis.

1120
01:22:59.48 --> 01:23:04.44
Speaking of fear, Steve Ambrose, who's a military historian, written a bunch of books including

1121
01:23:04.44 --> 01:23:10.12
band of brothers, Steve Ambrose says that heavy artillery bombardment will make even the most seasoned

1122
01:23:10.12 --> 01:23:19.16
veteran eventually brick. I disagree. A leader has to overcome fear convince himself that every

1123
01:23:19.16 --> 01:23:26.12
enemy shell or bullet is not targeting him. The same is true in a company or a battalion.

1124
01:23:26.12 --> 01:23:31.56
Leaders must ensure that strength and cohesion is a stronger force than fear. This is especially

1125
01:23:31.56 --> 01:23:38.12
true in men who have been scarred by prolonged combat. Ambrose was correct when he titled the chapter

1126
01:23:38.12 --> 01:23:43.80
band of in band of brothers breaking point. As he describes the horrendous artillery barrage that

1127
01:23:43.80 --> 01:23:51.08
inflicted so many casualties on easy company in the boy's jocks. Company strength was below 50%

1128
01:23:51.08 --> 01:23:58.04
and many of the non-commissioned officers were killed or wounded. Without direct supervision by

1129
01:23:58.04 --> 01:24:04.52
leaders, easy company as well as the remainder of the battalion could have easily been debilitated

1130
01:24:04.52 --> 01:24:11.88
by an increased sense of morality and fear. That is precisely why I made it a point to visit the

1131
01:24:11.88 --> 01:24:19.24
frontlines as often as possible. Soldiers need to sense that their leaders and commanders

1132
01:24:19.24 --> 01:24:30.44
are in the game with them. Leadership by example is even more important in these situations.

1133
01:24:31.48 --> 01:24:36.52
I noticed that when manner at the edge of their physical endurance you tend to develop that

1134
01:24:36.52 --> 01:24:41.72
1000 yard stare that you always read about. Tired soldiers will often take off their helmet

1135
01:24:41.72 --> 01:24:46.36
and run their fingers through their hair. I talked about that before and I talked about that quite

1136
01:24:46.36 --> 01:24:53.40
often now. At times they literally drop their helmets on the ground. This soldier is already losing

1137
01:24:53.40 --> 01:25:01.80
his self-respect. The battle is half lost. That's a sign for the commander to take a media action.

1138
01:25:02.84 --> 01:25:07.16
I didn't wait for the trooper to reach that stage. I proactively looked for these signs.

1139
01:25:07.16 --> 01:25:11.88
Every soldier wants to do the right thing. You always know the proper thing to do

1140
01:25:11.88 --> 01:25:18.12
but doing it is sometimes more difficult. I never wanted a man to lose his self-respect.

1141
01:25:19.56 --> 01:25:24.28
That's what I was talking about earlier. This thing of self-respect. When you don't care

1142
01:25:24.28 --> 01:25:30.12
because you're supposed to keep your gear on all the time. That's just the code. You keep your

1143
01:25:30.12 --> 01:25:35.08
gear with you all the time. You keep your gear all the time. The minute you take that off is where you

1144
01:25:35.08 --> 01:25:40.52
start. You're hanging out with what these guys think anymore. Something has happened that has made

1145
01:25:40.52 --> 01:25:46.28
you say, I don't care what these guys think anymore. That's not good. This is such a contradiction

1146
01:25:46.28 --> 01:25:51.40
because we consider talking about, I don't care what people think. I mean that. I mean that. You shouldn't

1147
01:25:51.40 --> 01:25:57.000
care what people think. But at the same time, it should be extremely important to what people think

1148
01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.96
and what your comrades think. That's such a weird dichotomy. I don't think I've fully wrapped my hands

1149
01:26:01.96 --> 01:26:06.68
around how to describe that yet and what that means. I'll get there eventually. Hopefully. But

1150
01:26:06.68 --> 01:26:12.92
that is a very important thing. I've always felt like I don't care what people think. But at the

1151
01:26:12.92 --> 01:26:22.12
same time, I deeply care what my peers think and my men think. We're dichotomy. I think that's a

1152
01:26:22.12 --> 01:26:27.32
core value. You have these core values. That's what you care about. You know what you think about

1153
01:26:27.32 --> 01:26:32.28
or what everyone else thinks. But anything beyond that is just superficial fluff. If you don't match

1154
01:26:32.28 --> 01:26:37.96
your socks, I think what the key principle here or the part that may help bring this together for me

1155
01:26:37.96 --> 01:26:44.60
is I want to be doing the right thing. Right. And so if I'm doing the right thing and people say,

1156
01:26:44.60 --> 01:26:51.96
oh, that's stupid what Joc was doing or he shouldn't be doing that. But I know in my heart,

1157
01:26:51.96 --> 01:26:55.64
I'm doing the right thing. Yeah. I'm going to continue doing it. I don't care what you think. Yeah.

1158
01:26:55.64 --> 01:27:01.80
There you go. But at the same time, if I know I'm doing the right thing and other people are

1159
01:27:01.80 --> 01:27:05.000
judging me, that's going to keep me in line. If I, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me

1160
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000
raise that. If I feel like I'm going to do the wrong thing, I do care what people think. Yeah.

1161
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.68
And I don't want them to think. Oh, Joc was getting weak, getting soft, getting, you know,

1162
01:27:14.68 --> 01:27:19.24
whatever. Yeah. He's doing the wrong thing. He's making the wrong move. Mm-hmm. Very strange.

1163
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.84
That's the, that's the dichotomy leadership, right? Or one of them. Actually, it's not really the

1164
01:27:24.84 --> 01:27:34.28
dichotomy leadership. That's just a dichotomy in life. Yeah, life, yeah. Now there's a

1165
01:27:36.44 --> 01:27:44.60
a guy named Lieutenant Compton who kind of breaks a little bit and they show it in the band

1166
01:27:44.60 --> 01:27:52.68
of brothers movie and they he, Dick Winner's talks about it here. Back to the book, before you go on,

1167
01:27:52.68 --> 01:27:57.48
I know you think I'm too hard on Lieutenant Compton for walking off the line at best, don't.

1168
01:27:58.44 --> 01:28:02.84
Let me explain myself. Buck, that's Lieutenant Compton was nicknamed Buck and he walked

1169
01:28:02.84 --> 01:28:10.44
off the line. Buck was a great combat leader. He was a superb platoon leader and Normandy and Holland.

1170
01:28:10.44 --> 01:28:16.20
In fact, I would say he was one of the best at best. At best, stone, he broke after some of his friends

1171
01:28:16.20 --> 01:28:22.12
were seriously wounded in the constant artillery barrages. There is a danger of getting

1172
01:28:22.12 --> 01:28:29.56
too close to the men and Buck crossed that line. When you see your friends getting maimed,

1173
01:28:29.56 --> 01:28:36.12
it makes it more difficult to go on. That's why I always maintained a certain detachment from the

1174
01:28:36.12 --> 01:28:43.56
parachute prison easy company. Am I too harsh on Buck? Maybe, but a leader needs to rise above fear.

1175
01:28:43.56 --> 01:28:54.44
The easiest thing to do is quit. And then the author asks, why didn't you crack and Dick Winner's

1176
01:28:54.44 --> 01:29:02.36
responses, I'm Pennsylvania Dutch. I don't quit. I made a commitment. Moral courage is based on

1177
01:29:02.36 --> 01:29:09.64
physical fitness. Courage is a combination of willpower and determination and determination.

1178
01:29:09.64 --> 01:29:15.56
I was an excellent physical shape. I don't think there was a man in the out that outfit who's

1179
01:29:15.56 --> 01:29:21.64
in better shape than I was and it showed. I had trained hard. In England, after we finished training,

1180
01:29:21.64 --> 01:29:27.80
I would run at night. Blackout conditions, but I would run. Then I'd come in and go to bed. I was

1181
01:29:27.80 --> 01:29:33.32
in maximum shape. That was the physical side of things, but there is a mental aspect of stamina as

1182
01:29:33.32 --> 01:29:39.88
well. I've always prideed myself that I do my own thinking. I have my own philosophy. I have my own

1183
01:29:39.88 --> 01:29:47.64
answers to the reasons things have turned out in my life. By taking full accountability for my life,

1184
01:29:47.64 --> 01:29:53.48
I've been able to meet the standards that I set for myself. I don't know any other way of saying it.

1185
01:29:55.96 --> 01:30:01.56
Every commander must take full accountability for his actions. Stand up and be counted.

1186
01:30:01.56 --> 01:30:07.24
As a commander, you are accountable for everything that your outfit does or fails to do.

1187
01:30:08.04 --> 01:30:12.36
Don't worry about who receives credit when things go well. Don't play the blame game.

1188
01:30:13.40 --> 01:30:18.60
In my case, the mantle of command provided me with the courage to succeed.

1189
01:30:21.32 --> 01:30:27.24
Yeah. Extreme ownership. That's what he's talking about. Personal accountability. That's what he's

1190
01:30:27.24 --> 01:30:33.48
talking about being in great physical condition. That's what he's talking about. That's discipline.

1191
01:30:35.48 --> 01:30:41.80
I guess as we read this, and I didn't read this book until a week ago.

1192
01:30:43.08 --> 01:30:47.80
Yeah, on a week ago, I read this book. It's not like I read this book and said, hey,

1193
01:30:49.24 --> 01:30:52.68
personal accountability is the most important thing about being a leader. No.

1194
01:30:52.68 --> 01:31:00.04
This is guy came to the same conclusion in World War II that I came to and conclusion in my experience in the military.

1195
01:31:04.60 --> 01:31:09.80
Now he starts talking a little bit about combat fatigue. How much combat fatigue there was.

1196
01:31:09.80 --> 01:31:14.68
In Normandy, I witnessed lots of stress. Some in Holland, much more in best known due to the

1197
01:31:14.68 --> 01:31:21.24
intense cold, lack of sleep and inadequate clothing. In Belgium, combat fatigue reached astronomical

1198
01:31:21.24 --> 01:31:27.72
proportions. We'd spent 70 days in the frontlines in Holland and didn't have time to recover before

1199
01:31:27.72 --> 01:31:35.000
we boarded the trucks to take us to Bastone. On reflection, I realized what was happened by the time

1200
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:41.80
the command arrived in Epastone. The men had been on the frontlines since Normandy. Men were

1201
01:31:41.80 --> 01:31:49.000
exhausted, no hot food, little sleep, no rest, constant tension, and intense pressure from combat.

1202
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:56.28
They were physically exhausted, inclement weather and constant rain and snow made matters even worse.

1203
01:31:57.48 --> 01:32:03.88
Physical exhaustion leads to mental exhaustion which in turn causes men to lose discipline.

1204
01:32:04.84 --> 01:32:08.52
The loss of self-discipline produces combat fatigue.

1205
01:32:12.12 --> 01:32:18.44
Over and over again. Over and over again, we hear that. How important is discipline? It is the most important

1206
01:32:18.44 --> 01:32:24.52
thing. If discipline is what gets people through these situations,

1207
01:32:26.04 --> 01:32:30.52
through combat stress, through tension, through bombs, through artillery, through freezing cold,

1208
01:32:30.52 --> 01:32:34.60
lack of food, lack of sleep, imagine what discipline can do in a normal person's life.

1209
01:32:40.36 --> 01:32:44.60
Back to the book, how can you possibly compare a man who's been under just one concentrated

1210
01:32:44.60 --> 01:32:49.80
artillery bombardment for five minutes to a place like Bastone where he could be in the line

1211
01:32:49.80 --> 01:32:56.44
for weeks or months? In one of Ambrose's books, he states that prolonged artillery bombardment

1212
01:32:56.44 --> 01:33:04.52
will break any soldier. In civilian life, of course, we refer to combat fatigue as a mental breakdown.

1213
01:33:05.48 --> 01:33:08.68
That is exactly the way it is in combat. It's a mental breakdown.

1214
01:33:09.64 --> 01:33:13.80
The intensity, it becomes a problem for me to express my feelings here,

1215
01:33:13.80 --> 01:33:18.84
but I'd like to share it with you. The intensity of a fire or a heavy concentration to be a leader,

1216
01:33:19.72 --> 01:33:24.68
you have to be able to concentrate on that fire and move just as soon as it stops or the last

1217
01:33:24.68 --> 01:33:30.92
rounds hit. Move. Get up. Start circulating among your men. Is everybody okay? Let's get up.

1218
01:33:30.92 --> 01:33:36.84
Let's move. Keep your eye open for an attack. Get their attention. Move among your men as quickly as

1219
01:33:36.84 --> 01:33:43.16
possible. And moving among them. The fact that they see you and they're talking to you,

1220
01:33:43.16 --> 01:33:47.64
they know that you are there and you are talking to them and it makes all the difference in the

1221
01:33:47.64 --> 01:33:55.000
world to know that you are not in this thing by yourself. That's what officers must do. Break the

1222
01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:02.68
cycle of fear. If a soldier is concentrating on his own feelings and on his own fear and he sees

1223
01:34:02.68 --> 01:34:09.88
you moving around, he realizes that you're sharing the burden with him. That's why he can then move.

1224
01:34:09.88 --> 01:34:15.64
So that's very important. And that's, you know, again, that can apply to combat that can

1225
01:34:15.64 --> 01:34:18.76
abide business. People are going to start panicking. What are they going to do in this

1226
01:34:18.76 --> 01:34:22.84
start panicking? You and the leader as the leader need to step up, get out there, talk to people.

1227
01:34:22.84 --> 01:34:27.32
Find out what's going on. Tell them that we're going to move. Show them that you're not afraid

1228
01:34:27.32 --> 01:34:32.52
and that you are afraid, but you're still functioning. Lead by example. Plain and simple.

1229
01:34:32.52 --> 01:34:42.84
Back to the book. Courage will be spent if you relax your standards. In undisciplined soldier

1230
01:34:42.84 --> 01:34:50.60
feels all isolated and alone. Maintain the standards. Don't compromise your integrity. Never get

1231
01:34:50.60 --> 01:34:57.64
up. Give up. Don't ever give up. I love this right here. There is always one more thing that a

1232
01:34:57.64 --> 01:35:06.28
leader can do to improve his situation and that of his command. I always felt that a leader's physical

1233
01:35:06.28 --> 01:35:12.84
presence was indispensable to unicohesion and morale. This is why I've capped in so bell

1234
01:35:12.84 --> 01:35:22.04
failed so miserably. Leadership by example, always Trump's leadership by fear. There's always

1235
01:35:22.04 --> 01:35:27.24
one more thing that a leader can do to improve his situation and that of his command is always

1236
01:35:27.24 --> 01:35:35.64
one more thing you can do. And an undisciplined soldier feels isolated and alone. They know

1237
01:35:35.64 --> 01:35:42.44
they've given up that self respect how you're going to give it back to them. When your men

1238
01:35:42.44 --> 01:35:51.72
are dying and you do not, you feel ashamed. I don't know any other way of saying it. Soldiers

1239
01:35:51.72 --> 01:35:58.84
in war certainly in World War II and I suspect in every war are generally young men in their prime.

1240
01:36:01.32 --> 01:36:08.20
They meet death daily and in every form. They fully realize the hazards of their

1241
01:36:08.20 --> 01:36:13.24
profession. They take chances because no young man expects to die before middle age.

1242
01:36:13.24 --> 01:36:24.92
When the first soldier dies, that belief in immortality is shattered. As casualties mount and the

1243
01:36:24.92 --> 01:36:30.60
core of the unit grows fewer, the remaining soldiers grow even stronger, often shutting off

1244
01:36:30.60 --> 01:36:36.04
replacement soldiers. They don't want to know the replacements because they are often the

1245
01:36:36.04 --> 01:36:46.36
first to die. When I saw one of my men wounded, I was happy that he had a ticket home.

1246
01:36:48.52 --> 01:36:56.52
A soldier killed and battle was at peace. He had lived his life among men whom he had loved.

1247
01:36:58.84 --> 01:37:03.56
I took a degree of consolation and knowing that my men had lived rather than regretting

1248
01:37:03.56 --> 01:37:11.32
that they had died. A soldier's real fear is not losing his life and combat,

1249
01:37:11.32 --> 01:37:19.32
but placing his comrades in jeopardy. That's why ordinary men will perform in extraordinary ways

1250
01:37:19.32 --> 01:37:22.12
to ensure that their buddies survive.

1251
01:37:22.12 --> 01:37:36.84
This is another level of war. When you're actually, and I never was at this point,

1252
01:37:36.84 --> 01:37:42.28
by any stretch, we're looking at men that get wounded and saying, oh, lucky him. He's got to take

1253
01:37:42.28 --> 01:37:54.60
it home. We just weren't under that knee, that casualty level at all. When guys were getting wounded,

1254
01:37:54.60 --> 01:37:59.80
it was hard. It wasn't a good feeling. I was lucky him. He's got to take it home.

1255
01:37:59.80 --> 01:38:03.32
There wasn't enough guys getting wounded to make you think that way. Not enough guys getting

1256
01:38:03.32 --> 01:38:13.000
killed to make you think that way. Small percentage. That's the reaching a whole new level. Back to

1257
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.72
the book. If you have selected the right personnel, then a leader must instill discipline.

1258
01:38:18.36 --> 01:38:23.16
I mean perfect discipline. As Pat and one said, discipline is the soul of the army.

1259
01:38:24.52 --> 01:38:29.88
General Washington said the same thing when he described the continental army in 1776.

1260
01:38:29.88 --> 01:38:36.92
Discipline is manifested in how well a soldier keeps his uniform, how frequently cleans his weapon,

1261
01:38:36.92 --> 01:38:47.32
and the pride he has in his unit. Joe Hogan of easy company speaks for all of us on the subject

1262
01:38:47.32 --> 01:38:53.72
of pride in company E. During an argument with a soldier from another company about whose company

1263
01:38:53.72 --> 01:39:00.68
was better, Joe said, my company E will lick your company in 15 minutes. If you wait until the

1264
01:39:00.68 --> 01:39:08.44
guys who are A-wall come back, we'll do it in five minutes. This is important. Unit pride

1265
01:39:08.44 --> 01:39:16.04
leads to unit discipline. Again, now we're going back to the feelings that I had when I was a

1266
01:39:16.04 --> 01:39:21.80
young kid in the SEAL teams. I told him pride in my platoon. This is funny because you said,

1267
01:39:21.80 --> 01:39:26.44
like look, the guys that are gone right now, they're A-wall, they're absent without leave. If they

1268
01:39:26.44 --> 01:39:31.24
give you A for them to come back, we'll be getting this done in five minutes. But you know, I feel like

1269
01:39:31.24 --> 01:39:37.64
this unit pride and unit discipline how they go together. It's like a gang. I don't know why I think

1270
01:39:37.64 --> 01:39:41.80
of this way, and I talked about this semester. It's like a gang mentality when you start policing

1271
01:39:41.80 --> 01:39:50.04
yourself up. When I was in a SEAL platoon, it wasn't our bosses that were trying to keep us in line.

1272
01:39:50.04 --> 01:39:54.84
We kept ourselves in line. You didn't want to get out of the side. You didn't want to do something

1273
01:39:54.84 --> 01:40:00.60
wrong because you're going to get placed up by the boys. The E5 mafia is what we were.

1274
01:40:01.40 --> 01:40:05.96
So the E5 mafia, that's a real thing, by the way. The E5 mafia, you know, SEAL platoon,

1275
01:40:05.96 --> 01:40:11.72
you've got the senior guys who's like the platoon, the platoon chief, the leading patty officer.

1276
01:40:12.28 --> 01:40:17.000
Those are like E67 and you've got the assistant platoon commander. Those are like they call

1277
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.16
the top four. Those are the guys that kind of run their actual leadership. And then you got the

1278
01:40:21.16 --> 01:40:26.20
nugs and then in the middle of the pack right there, you've got the E5s. They're the guys that are

1279
01:40:26.20 --> 01:40:30.36
actually running things and making things happen and the E5 mafia is what we call them. And then

1280
01:40:30.36 --> 01:40:36.60
in a SEAL team, there's an E5 mafia that all works together to make things happen. But with the E5

1281
01:40:36.60 --> 01:40:41.88
mafia, if you've got a good unit, that E5 mafia, they're policing up everything. And you don't need

1282
01:40:41.88 --> 01:40:46.92
it as a leader, you just need to make sure that they don't take it too far. It's the only thing you need

1283
01:40:46.92 --> 01:40:50.28
to make sure. But they're going to make sure guys are doing the right thing. They're going to make

1284
01:40:50.28 --> 01:40:52.52
sure that they're performing well. They're going to make sure that they're in a good shape. They're

1285
01:40:52.52 --> 01:41:03.40
going to make sure all those things. And this was an interesting quote. What you tolerate,

1286
01:41:03.40 --> 01:41:11.88
you condone. So again, extreme ownership written by myself and lay Fab and will lay Fab and

1287
01:41:11.88 --> 01:41:16.44
wrote a line in there and says, it's not what you preach. It's what you tolerate. And he hadn't read

1288
01:41:16.44 --> 01:41:22.84
this book and here it is. What you tolerate, you condone to saying the exact same thing. If you let

1289
01:41:22.84 --> 01:41:31.16
standards start to slide, that's what you're done. That's the new standard. Of course,

1290
01:41:31.16 --> 01:41:37.64
there's a little bit more to leadership than what we've talked about so far. Back to the book

1291
01:41:37.64 --> 01:41:44.12
leading in battle is the art of dealing with human nature and the human condition.

1292
01:41:45.80 --> 01:41:50.52
I can't speak of higher command. But I know a few things about leadership at the small unit level.

1293
01:41:51.56 --> 01:41:57.16
Leadership at all levels, wins, wars, but soldiers at the platoon, company and batalion levels,

1294
01:41:57.16 --> 01:42:03.24
win battles. I think this particularly true in the national army where soldiers need to understand

1295
01:42:03.24 --> 01:42:10.52
the reasons behind the officers orders. We have to know why we're doing what we're doing. What I

1296
01:42:10.52 --> 01:42:17.16
have succeeded had I been promoted beyond battalion? I don't know. I do know that I felt comfortable

1297
01:42:17.16 --> 01:42:23.24
at the small unit level. This is one reason why easy company holds such a tender place in my heart.

1298
01:42:23.24 --> 01:42:29.80
I knew the strengths and weaknesses of every paratrooper. I could rapidly ascertain what I wanted

1299
01:42:29.80 --> 01:42:35.40
to do and felt confident that I could convince the men to do it. After commanding easy company

1300
01:42:35.40 --> 01:42:41.08
and Normandy and Holland, I know that the men felt comfortable entrusting their lives to my care.

1301
01:42:42.60 --> 01:42:46.52
I'm not bragging because it's not my nature to do so. I'm stating fact.

1302
01:42:47.80 --> 01:42:51.96
Knowing that I would never ask them to do anything that I wouldn't do myself,

1303
01:42:51.96 --> 01:42:59.64
led to easy company's confidence in me as a leader. They knew that I would never quit and

1304
01:42:59.64 --> 01:43:03.32
that I would do everything within my power to bring them home after the war.

1305
01:43:06.52 --> 01:43:11.24
I'm proud when I hear a paratrooper from easy company or second batalion remark about my courage

1306
01:43:11.24 --> 01:43:17.88
under fire by willingness to share their hardships. I told you once that wars do not make great men.

1307
01:43:17.88 --> 01:43:22.92
But war sometimes bring out the greatness in good men.

1308
01:43:29.88 --> 01:43:37.24
Human nature. That's what it is. That's sort of how I describe this podcast now.

1309
01:43:37.24 --> 01:43:42.68
An exploration of human nature. If you want to see human nature reveal itself and it's most

1310
01:43:42.68 --> 01:43:48.84
clear as to form you have to go to war. Don't look at that. Or other very

1311
01:43:48.84 --> 01:43:52.12
strenuous situations. Harsh situations.

1312
01:43:57.16 --> 01:44:02.92
Upon returning from the war, here's what major winters had to say back to the book. The war changed

1313
01:44:02.92 --> 01:44:09.64
me. I returned to the state's bitter. A different man than the young man who had

1314
01:44:09.64 --> 01:44:18.60
listed in the army in 1941. I was hardened when I returned. First impressions were more important

1315
01:44:18.60 --> 01:44:25.72
than they had previously been. I looked at things differently. When you return from a war time

1316
01:44:25.72 --> 01:44:31.16
environment, you have to adjust to society. The life that you are going to be sharing with others

1317
01:44:31.16 --> 01:44:36.60
just to make a living. Though I was comfortable in a combat environment, I wondered if I would

1318
01:44:36.60 --> 01:44:42.04
feel at home among civilized people who wouldn't be able to understand how a soldier thinks and feels.

1319
01:44:43.88 --> 01:44:48.60
I came to understand that I would have to make changes to be accepted into life at home.

1320
01:44:51.08 --> 01:44:58.28
This takes time and it's never easy. While on the front lines in prolonged combat,

1321
01:44:58.28 --> 01:45:03.24
I often wondered about my friends back in the states old friends I had grown up with. Some of

1322
01:45:03.24 --> 01:45:10.20
whom had avoided coming over, either by becoming conscience and subjectors or working in war related

1323
01:45:10.20 --> 01:45:17.72
factories that the federal government had declared essential. I understand everyone doesn't have to

1324
01:45:17.72 --> 01:45:22.60
share my belief that military services is the only form of service in wartime, but I took a

1325
01:45:22.60 --> 01:45:30.28
men's pride in my contribution to the war effort. We who fought the war were part of something noble.

1326
01:45:30.28 --> 01:45:39.000
Military services and honor, a privilege. Funny thing is that when I finally returned home,

1327
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.24
I had no desire to pick up with those friends who managed to skip the whole thing.

1328
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.76
I completely shut them out. I wouldn't come downstairs when they knocked on the door.

1329
01:45:52.44 --> 01:45:56.60
Even today, when I look at a man or woman, I can't help but judge them.

1330
01:45:56.60 --> 01:46:05.72
Does he have leadership capabilities? Which he'd be good in combat? Does he or she have

1331
01:46:06.52 --> 01:46:20.20
what it takes? I think clearly when you come home, those are things I think everybody goes through.

1332
01:46:20.20 --> 01:46:28.20
Of your looking at people, you're kind of judging people. It certainly will leave a mark. I'll tell you,

1333
01:46:28.20 --> 01:46:32.84
I don't think there's enough veterans now. You're not going to be able to just hang around with veterans.

1334
01:46:32.84 --> 01:46:36.84
It's not going to happen. You've got to understand and accept the fact that not everyone

1335
01:46:36.84 --> 01:46:46.12
served the way you served. That's just the way it is. I try to make sure that I would

1336
01:46:46.12 --> 01:46:54.04
leave hold people to a higher expectation. Any other thing is, I think you have to walk a fine

1337
01:46:54.04 --> 01:46:59.64
line and you've got to make sure you're not looking down on people because they didn't choose

1338
01:46:59.64 --> 01:47:06.20
the path that you chose. Now World War II is different because at least appears to be different

1339
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.68
because it was so easy. So many people went on the path of December 7th happened. I'm going to

1340
01:47:12.68 --> 01:47:20.20
sign up tomorrow today, whatever. And I think that the way these wars that we've been fighting have

1341
01:47:20.20 --> 01:47:25.80
gone down has been the same. It's been different. And I think we veterans right now have to use

1342
01:47:25.80 --> 01:47:31.08
some caution before just shutting out everyone else that didn't serve the way we did.

1343
01:47:33.16 --> 01:47:37.32
We'd be shutting out basically. You probably be shutting out most of the people in your lives.

1344
01:47:37.32 --> 01:47:42.60
Most of my friends outside the sealed teams, they're you know, do you get to? Got a bunch of friends

1345
01:47:42.60 --> 01:47:49.000
from do you get to none of them served? I can't just shut them all out. So I think we have to be careful

1346
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:57.64
about that as as veterans to make sure we you're going to have those feelings understood,

1347
01:47:59.64 --> 01:48:05.16
understand that there's more than that and you've got to accept other things going on in the

1348
01:48:05.16 --> 01:48:19.000
world besides what we did. Another letter that Dick Winner's wrote to Deyetta Alman

1349
01:48:20.04 --> 01:48:23.96
going back to the book when you're an officer you are responsible for the lives of soldiers in

1350
01:48:23.96 --> 01:48:31.64
your command. You think about kids like this one parachute brand new well and you soon become old

1351
01:48:31.64 --> 01:48:38.28
beyond your years. In the three years since I had entered the army I'd aged a great deal.

1352
01:48:39.80 --> 01:48:45.16
It seems as if college days and days of civilian life when I did as I pleased or long past.

1353
01:48:46.60 --> 01:48:52.04
I must have been a it must have been a dream a small and short but beautiful part of my life.

1354
01:48:53.88 --> 01:49:00.44
Now all I do is work. Work to improve myself as an officer. Work to improve them as fighters as

1355
01:49:00.44 --> 01:49:10.04
men make them work to improve themselves. The result is I am old before my time not physically old

1356
01:49:10.04 --> 01:49:14.76
but hardened to the point where I can make the rest of them look like undeveloped high school

1357
01:49:14.76 --> 01:49:22.12
boys old to the extent where I can keep going after my men fall over and sleep from exhaustion.

1358
01:49:24.36 --> 01:49:29.40
I can keep going as a mother who works after her sick child and exhausted child

1359
01:49:29.40 --> 01:49:35.56
has fallen asleep. Old to the extent where if it's a decision or advice needed my decisions are

1360
01:49:35.56 --> 01:49:43.000
taken as if the wisdom behind them was infallible. Yes I feel old and tired from training these men

1361
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.96
to the point where they are efficient fighters. I hope it means that some will return to those

1362
01:49:49.96 --> 01:50:01.08
girls back home. Again the reason I put that in there is because there's that's a that's

1363
01:50:01.08 --> 01:50:06.44
pressure. That's the certain amount of pressure that a person that's been in the military has felt

1364
01:50:08.04 --> 01:50:13.48
and it's real that pressure.

1365
01:50:13.48 --> 01:50:22.84
And his wife said Dick fights the battle of the ball to virtually every night.

1366
01:50:25.08 --> 01:50:33.56
He had recurring nightmares. So even Dick winners, you know, a very thoughtful and square

1367
01:50:33.56 --> 01:50:47.000
away guy was still living those nightmares virtually every night. His wife said Dick also said back to

1368
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.12
the book. I know I did everything within my power to ensure as many soldiers made it home from the

1369
01:50:52.12 --> 01:51:05.72
war as possible. But when you survive and your soldiers don't you feel guilty. It haunts me to this

1370
01:51:05.72 --> 01:51:14.68
day that I lived and so many of my pair of troops died as the veterans of easy company pass on.

1371
01:51:14.68 --> 01:51:28.36
I reminded of those who never returned from the war. I see their faces. I can almost hear them calling me.

1372
01:51:28.36 --> 01:51:47.48
And again I think that everybody that served and survived when your friends and your brothers didn't

1373
01:51:47.48 --> 01:51:57.08
you're always gonna have that. It's not gonna go away.

1374
01:51:57.08 --> 01:52:24.68
And Dick winners, major Dick winners died January 2nd, 2011. Obviously they had a

1375
01:52:24.68 --> 01:52:32.28
memorial service, a big memorial service for him back to the book. Those who remained alive,

1376
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:40.20
voiced their sympathy. He said former Patoon Sergeant William Grner, who had lost a leg

1377
01:52:40.20 --> 01:52:49.40
outside Bastone. Dick always said, hang tough and follow me. When he said, let's go, he was

1378
01:52:49.40 --> 01:52:57.32
right in the front. He was never in the back a leader personified. He was the best commander we ever had.

1379
01:52:58.84 --> 01:53:06.28
We'd have followed him anywhere. Edward Beib Heffron, who served alongside winners at Bastone

1380
01:53:06.28 --> 01:53:11.40
and who helped liberate Hitler's Eagles nest, added he was one hell of a guy, one of the greatest

1381
01:53:11.40 --> 01:53:18.44
soldiers I ever was under. He was a wonderful officer, a wonderful leader. He had what you needed.

1382
01:53:18.44 --> 01:53:24.36
Guuts and brains. He took care of his men. That's very important.

1383
01:53:26.68 --> 01:53:30.92
Pop-I-Win added. It seemed as if he always made the right decision.

1384
01:53:32.92 --> 01:53:39.000
He was a real soldier. He was one of the best. It started with him doing the right thing.

1385
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:49.96
I don't know how he survived the war, but he did. Another easy company veteran concurred,

1386
01:53:49.96 --> 01:53:57.40
noting every one of us we'd follow him to hell. That's the type of guy he was.

1387
01:53:57.40 --> 01:54:11.24
And also speaking, at that ceremony was a guy by the name of Eric Jenjensen,

1388
01:54:12.44 --> 01:54:15.56
who was the screenwriter, one of the screenwriters for band of brothers.

1389
01:54:15.56 --> 01:54:27.08
And he was trying to get the screenplay in the series to be as accurate as possible.

1390
01:54:27.08 --> 01:54:30.60
And so he spent a lot of time with Dick Winters and he got to know him very well.

1391
01:54:30.60 --> 01:54:36.84
And I found what he said about Dick Winters to be very important. Here we go back to the book.

1392
01:54:36.84 --> 01:54:41.32
Dick Winters made it his personal quest to excel.

1393
01:54:41.32 --> 01:54:49.08
Whether it was executing the perfect push-up or training himself to run three miles up and down

1394
01:54:49.08 --> 01:54:54.60
Kerriy Mountain, this pursuit was his private tool, his solution.

1395
01:54:56.52 --> 01:55:03.96
And it was that solo effort, that obsessive clarity and pure, determined, self-contained purpose.

1396
01:55:03.96 --> 01:55:10.92
That is men observed and that caused them to follow when he said simply follow me.

1397
01:55:12.68 --> 01:55:18.44
Not just through that hedge row enormity and across that field and Holland under enemy fire,

1398
01:55:20.12 --> 01:55:27.56
but follow my example, follow my commitment and we'll get through this

1399
01:55:27.56 --> 01:55:31.48
then we will succeed.

1400
01:55:39.48 --> 01:55:47.56
Dick Winters was laid to rest in his family plot in the evangelical Lutheran cemetery

1401
01:55:48.44 --> 01:55:52.84
in the Frada, Pennsylvania, the Saturday following his death.

1402
01:55:52.84 --> 01:56:06.20
And his grave stone reads simply, Richard D. Winters, World War II,

1403
01:56:06.20 --> 01:56:22.12
101st Airborne, 1918 to 2011.

1404
01:56:22.12 --> 01:56:35.08
And Dick Winters before he died said, I am the man I am today because of easy company.

1405
01:56:36.68 --> 01:56:44.12
Easy company made me as I reflect upon my life since the war. I can honestly say that it has been

1406
01:56:44.12 --> 01:56:47.64
a lifetime search for men like those I knew in easy company.

1407
01:56:47.64 --> 01:56:56.76
I haven't found too many. I don't think I know braver soldiers, the Joe Toy,

1408
01:56:56.76 --> 01:57:04.92
Bill Gwantier, Floyd Talbert. I live with these guys every day. I mourn when they pass.

1409
01:57:06.44 --> 01:57:12.68
Carwood Lipton died in December 2001. His death struck me particularly hard.

1410
01:57:12.68 --> 01:57:21.40
So did bull ramblements. Lipton didn't live to see the acclaim easy company received when the

1411
01:57:21.40 --> 01:57:30.52
miniseries was released. I tried not to think of the bad times anymore. I think mostly of the good times.

1412
01:57:30.52 --> 01:57:39.24
The emotion will always be there.

1413
01:57:39.24 --> 01:58:08.20
And Dick Winters said that war brings out greatness and men. And he also realized

1414
01:58:08.20 --> 01:58:15.56
that war makes you appreciate your country.

1415
01:58:19.56 --> 01:58:24.52
The major winners before he died said, well, it probably sounds strange to you.

1416
01:58:25.32 --> 01:58:31.40
But when I brought easy company to Utah Beach so we could board the LST to return to England

1417
01:58:31.40 --> 01:58:38.04
on July 11, 1944. I saw that beach for the first time with that vast amount of ships as far as

1418
01:58:38.04 --> 01:58:46.52
the eye could see in every direction. Seeing the American flag fluttering over that beach,

1419
01:58:46.52 --> 01:58:55.16
I felt weak in the knees and tears filled my eyes. Suddenly, that flag meant something different

1420
01:58:55.16 --> 01:59:03.80
than it ever had before. I've never looked at our flag since without that memory in mind.

1421
01:59:05.80 --> 01:59:11.96
Now I'm an old man, but that feeling is never left to me.

1422
01:59:11.96 --> 01:59:39.08
And finally, then I always say that war is awful and war is a nightmare.

1423
01:59:42.28 --> 01:59:49.32
But war does certainly make you appreciate life.

1424
01:59:57.56 --> 02:00:02.68
And Dick Winters certainly appreciated the rest of his life.

1425
02:00:02.68 --> 02:00:16.44
And he said this, I sit here in this house and I gaze out the window.

1426
02:00:18.76 --> 02:00:25.64
I see flowers and the birds, I behold the wonder of nature.

1427
02:00:25.64 --> 02:00:33.24
Everything seems so beautiful.

1428
02:00:33.24 --> 02:01:03.16
And that wraps up that book. Everything seems so beautiful. And you know, over the past couple of weeks,

1429
02:01:03.72 --> 02:01:09.96
I've been traveling a bunch and meeting a lot of different people, business people,

1430
02:01:12.68 --> 02:01:21.24
workers, police and firefighters and active duty, military and veterans, just people.

1431
02:01:21.24 --> 02:01:31.80
And we people, we get caught up in all kinds of chaos and mayhem.

1432
02:01:35.56 --> 02:01:40.28
Mayhem from the past. We get caught up in that about what we should have done.

1433
02:01:42.68 --> 02:01:44.52
Or what we should have left undone.

1434
02:01:44.52 --> 02:01:54.76
And we feel this pressure about the future about what we should do or what we shouldn't do or where we're going and how we should get there.

1435
02:01:54.76 --> 02:02:01.96
And I get that. I get that. I understand it. I feel it too.

1436
02:02:01.96 --> 02:02:15.40
Life is hard. Life is hard. And if you aren't careful, it will grind you down.

1437
02:02:19.48 --> 02:02:26.68
And you know, I talk about detachment a lot from a leadership perspective and we talked about it today.

1438
02:02:26.68 --> 02:02:38.12
And it's certainly important. But it's also a tool for your mind. And for your sanity, step back.

1439
02:02:41.80 --> 02:02:44.36
Step back and look around.

1440
02:02:44.36 --> 02:02:58.36
Not just to see what your next move is and where to head next and what to focus on, but step back to look around and see life.

1441
02:03:02.60 --> 02:03:12.36
This life, your life, not surrounded by the pressure and the war and the failures and the violence and the nightmares and the mistakes and the grind.

1442
02:03:12.36 --> 02:03:26.36
Not that life. But life as it is, as it is without our intervention.

1443
02:03:26.36 --> 02:03:49.48
Ablescent. A journey, a short little bit of time on an incredibly fast moving sphere of amazement.

1444
02:03:49.48 --> 02:04:11.48
Where if you can detach and step back and look for a moment, you'll see that like Dick Winner said.

1445
02:04:11.48 --> 02:04:30.28
Everything seems so beautiful. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So echo Charles. Yeah.

1446
02:04:30.28 --> 02:04:52.28
Some lessons learned. Yeah. Very impactful for me and a big reminder for me we worked heavily with the first the 506 band of brothers in the Battle of Romani.

1447
02:04:52.28 --> 02:05:04.28
We had the Delta Poutine Commander and a group of his guys spent the whole time over there and what incredible bunch of soldiers they were just incredible.

1448
02:05:04.28 --> 02:05:10.28
The impact that they had on the battlefield, the leadership I saw at every level.

1449
02:05:10.28 --> 02:05:24.28
Whenever I think of the band of brothers, my first thoughts when I think of the band of brothers is about Dick Winner's. It is about the series. It isn't about the books. My first thought of the band of brothers is the first the 506 battalion.

1450
02:05:24.28 --> 02:05:40.28
That we were honored to work with in the Battle of Romani and one of my Poutoons worked intently with the entire time. And so for their service and sacrifice,

1451
02:05:40.28 --> 02:05:52.28
I am eternally thankful for what they did and what they taught us and for us being alongside them was a real humbling, real humbling.

1452
02:05:52.28 --> 02:06:16.28
You mentioned how, in all these books and all these lessons that discipline is so important and there was time you mentioned like imagine or imagine how important it is or how beneficial whatever it could be just in every day like remember that.

1453
02:06:16.28 --> 02:06:26.28
That's crazy. The more books like this that we go over whatever that message becomes more and more clear.

1454
02:06:26.28 --> 02:06:34.28
You know how like you get creative guys, but they don't have discipline or you get super disciplined guys, but they don't have creativity or you know.

1455
02:06:34.28 --> 02:06:47.28
But everyone's in a while you'll find a person or you'll notice a person who does bring them together and you see the results like you see what kind of productivity or you just see the result in one way or

1456
02:06:47.28 --> 02:06:55.28
Like these good like fighters or you know I don't know author like anyone doing absolutely so I'm and it's crazy how.

1457
02:06:55.28 --> 02:07:04.28
Because you know if you're like naturally gifted or whatever at something you're in a way not like, like,

1458
02:07:04.28 --> 02:07:06.28
I don't know what that's like.

1459
02:07:06.28 --> 02:07:13.28
I mean it lets you notice someone and you see it in all these different fields as well or where oh someone that's got a lot of natural talent.

1460
02:07:13.28 --> 02:07:18.28
Yeah, but they don't they don't have to because essentially through upbringing or whatever the just environment.

1461
02:07:18.28 --> 02:07:23.28
They don't need it really you know they don't need it like just get away with it because they're just being their talent.

1462
02:07:23.28 --> 02:07:28.28
Yeah, I mean I think we hear that a lot this idea that you know talent.

1463
02:07:28.28 --> 02:07:35.28
It doesn't mean anything if you don't have the discipline to make things happen and a person that's highly disciplined will outperform.

1464
02:07:35.28 --> 02:07:38.28
Someone that might be more talented all day or until.

1465
02:07:38.28 --> 02:07:41.28
Yeah, I think it was all day long too strong.

1466
02:07:41.28 --> 02:07:43.28
I was in the beginning.

1467
02:07:43.28 --> 02:07:46.28
In the beginning I think it's actually yeah I feel like eventually.

1468
02:07:46.28 --> 02:07:49.28
The discipline is the thing that's just going to carry you through.

1469
02:07:49.28 --> 02:07:58.28
So and I thought I just thought that was super important where you were like imagine if this if you apply this to everyday life because everyday life essentially for us anyway.

1470
02:07:58.28 --> 02:08:00.28
It's like a straight up luxury.

1471
02:08:00.28 --> 02:08:07.28
Yeah, it is and here's what's important about what you're saying is is this fact that the reason that these guys.

1472
02:08:07.28 --> 02:08:12.28
Had to have discipline was because if they didn't have discipline they would die.

1473
02:08:12.28 --> 02:08:14.28
Yeah, if they didn't have discipline they would be overrun.

1474
02:08:14.28 --> 02:08:16.28
If they didn't have discipline they would they would starve.

1475
02:08:16.28 --> 02:08:19.28
They would just die they would die.

1476
02:08:19.28 --> 02:08:24.28
They would have to have discipline and your point is in this world and this life.

1477
02:08:24.28 --> 02:08:33.28
In 2017 the living in the first world you don't have to have discipline at all and you'll still survive and you might even do okay.

1478
02:08:33.28 --> 02:08:34.28
Yeah, sure.

1479
02:08:34.28 --> 02:08:35.28
I mean just imagine.

1480
02:08:35.28 --> 02:08:36.28
Yeah.

1481
02:08:36.28 --> 02:08:41.28
Just imagine if you apply the discipline to your life where you'll end up.

1482
02:08:41.28 --> 02:08:42.28
Yeah.

1483
02:08:42.28 --> 02:08:43.28
And how much better off you'll be.

1484
02:08:43.28 --> 02:08:46.28
And how much more you can do with your life.

1485
02:08:46.28 --> 02:08:48.28
The one life you have by the way.

1486
02:08:48.28 --> 02:08:55.28
And how much of the way you can do with that life if you just have the discipline and work hard and get after it.

1487
02:08:55.28 --> 02:08:56.28
Yeah.

1488
02:08:56.28 --> 02:08:58.28
And you see it in little pockets too.

1489
02:08:58.28 --> 02:08:59.28
Remember when you're a kid.

1490
02:08:59.28 --> 02:09:03.28
And you're like I'm going to save my money for this.

1491
02:09:03.28 --> 02:09:05.28
I don't know comic book.

1492
02:09:05.28 --> 02:09:06.28
I don't know.

1493
02:09:06.28 --> 02:09:07.28
I'm going to save my money.

1494
02:09:07.28 --> 02:09:11.28
You don't even have an income by the way, but somehow you save all your money like that little

1495
02:09:11.28 --> 02:09:13.28
quarter that you find.

1496
02:09:13.28 --> 02:09:15.28
That's a old you know you I'm going to save that.

1497
02:09:15.28 --> 02:09:21.28
I'm going to save that because you have this kind of end in a way like the discipline kind of forms itself around that goal.

1498
02:09:21.28 --> 02:09:25.28
So you know what it is like you know what that means you know.

1499
02:09:25.28 --> 02:09:27.28
So it's real like that's a real thing.

1500
02:09:27.28 --> 02:09:30.28
You shouldn't you shouldn't regard it as some ambiguous thing that.

1501
02:09:30.28 --> 02:09:32.28
Yeah, no it's not.

1502
02:09:32.28 --> 02:09:33.28
It's not so.

1503
02:09:33.28 --> 02:09:34.28
It's not so.

1504
02:09:34.28 --> 02:09:35.28
It's not so.

1505
02:09:35.28 --> 02:09:37.28
It's not so.

1506
02:09:37.28 --> 02:09:38.28
It's not so.

1507
02:09:38.28 --> 02:09:41.28
It's not so.

1508
02:09:41.28 --> 02:09:43.28
The first podcast we did.

1509
02:09:43.28 --> 02:09:44.28
I said something along the lines.

1510
02:09:44.28 --> 02:09:46.28
I'm like you know what you need to do.

1511
02:09:46.28 --> 02:09:47.28
Yeah.

1512
02:09:47.28 --> 02:09:48.28
Like we all know what we should be doing.

1513
02:09:48.28 --> 02:09:49.28
I think that one of the first.

1514
02:09:49.28 --> 02:09:51.28
There's not so many people that are lost that are going on.

1515
02:09:51.28 --> 02:09:52.28
I'm just not sure how to do this.

1516
02:09:52.28 --> 02:09:55.28
No, they know exactly what we know exactly what I should be doing.

1517
02:09:55.28 --> 02:09:57.28
I'll tell you what it is.

1518
02:09:57.28 --> 02:09:58.28
Distractions.

1519
02:09:58.28 --> 02:09:59.28
Distractions are literally everything.

1520
02:09:59.28 --> 02:10:01.28
There's industries of just distractions.

1521
02:10:01.28 --> 02:10:04.28
That's the whole industry like TV.

1522
02:10:04.28 --> 02:10:05.28
TV industry of distract.

1523
02:10:05.28 --> 02:10:10.28
Huge and the in the defense of TV TV can be a.

1524
02:10:10.28 --> 02:10:11.28
Yeah, you can.

1525
02:10:11.28 --> 02:10:13.28
You because there's educational stuff on TV.

1526
02:10:13.28 --> 02:10:15.28
Um, decided.

1527
02:10:15.28 --> 02:10:17.28
I'm just saying like see your point.

1528
02:10:17.28 --> 02:10:20.28
The entertainment industry and I'm not saying.

1529
02:10:20.28 --> 02:10:22.28
These industries of distractions are bad things.

1530
02:10:22.28 --> 02:10:23.28
I'm not saying that.

1531
02:10:23.28 --> 02:10:26.28
I'm just saying distractions are what get in the way of.

1532
02:10:26.28 --> 02:10:29.28
I don't know for lack of a better term like your your goal.

1533
02:10:29.28 --> 02:10:30.28
Yeah, and.

1534
02:10:30.28 --> 02:10:32.28
Well, we're talking about.

1535
02:10:32.28 --> 02:10:37.28
The very fact of some of your discipline can be used to create things that are actually distracting.

1536
02:10:37.28 --> 02:10:41.28
I mean, if you if your goal is to create some artistic piece, whether it's a movie,

1537
02:10:41.28 --> 02:10:44.28
whether it's music, whether it's whatever.

1538
02:10:44.28 --> 02:10:45.28
Yeah.

1539
02:10:45.28 --> 02:10:48.28
That that's a distracting thing, but that's not that doesn't mean that it's negative.

1540
02:10:48.28 --> 02:10:49.28
They want to make that happen.

1541
02:10:49.28 --> 02:10:50.28
Yes.

1542
02:10:50.28 --> 02:10:51.28
There's people that'll find something.

1543
02:10:51.28 --> 02:10:54.28
I mean, the reason you want to create something is.

1544
02:10:54.28 --> 02:10:56.28
I guess you create it for yourself.

1545
02:10:56.28 --> 02:10:59.28
But then the reward is when other people say that.

1546
02:10:59.28 --> 02:11:02.28
Yes, I get something out of here.

1547
02:11:02.28 --> 02:11:03.28
Yeah.

1548
02:11:03.28 --> 02:11:05.28
Recognize for me, Pierce.

1549
02:11:05.28 --> 02:11:05.28
Yeah.

1550
02:11:05.28 --> 02:11:06.28
For sure.

1551
02:11:06.28 --> 02:11:07.28
Yeah.

1552
02:11:07.28 --> 02:11:08.28
And when I say distractions, I.

1553
02:11:08.28 --> 02:11:13.28
In regards to goal, it's a relative thing, meaning like you're distracted from your path of the goal.

1554
02:11:13.28 --> 02:11:14.28
I agree with you.

1555
02:11:14.28 --> 02:11:17.28
Yeah, but there's also just just mentally just just weakness.

1556
02:11:17.28 --> 02:11:19.28
Just the easy path I should say.

1557
02:11:19.28 --> 02:11:20.28
Right.

1558
02:11:20.28 --> 02:11:21.28
The discipline plan is hard.

1559
02:11:21.28 --> 02:11:24.28
The easy path that anyone wants to jump on when you're alarm clock goes off.

1560
02:11:24.28 --> 02:11:25.28
I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll right.

1561
02:11:25.28 --> 02:11:26.28
I've talked about these things a million times.

1562
02:11:26.28 --> 02:11:27.28
That's what the problem is.

1563
02:11:27.28 --> 02:11:29.28
The problem isn't even distraction.

1564
02:11:29.28 --> 02:11:31.28
The problem is just the lack of will to do what you need to do.

1565
02:11:31.28 --> 02:11:32.28
Right.

1566
02:11:32.28 --> 02:11:33.28
The distraction can add to that.

1567
02:11:33.28 --> 02:11:34.28
That's a part of it.

1568
02:11:34.28 --> 02:11:36.28
What we do is we take.

1569
02:11:36.28 --> 02:11:37.28
We take our.

1570
02:11:37.28 --> 02:11:41.28
The path of least is resistance and then we throw distraction on top of that.

1571
02:11:41.28 --> 02:11:45.28
For instance, when you open up your computer because you got a right of book.

1572
02:11:45.28 --> 02:11:47.28
And instead of opening the word process, you come on.

1573
02:11:47.28 --> 02:11:50.28
I'm just going to check the interwebs real quick distracted.

1574
02:11:50.28 --> 02:11:51.28
Yeah, you're distracted.

1575
02:11:51.28 --> 02:11:52.28
There goes 45 minutes.

1576
02:11:52.28 --> 02:11:53.28
You have a.

1577
02:11:53.28 --> 02:11:54.28
You have a.

1578
02:11:54.28 --> 02:11:57.28
The internet is the internet is a mind time warp.

1579
02:11:57.28 --> 02:11:58.28
Oh, yeah.

1580
02:11:58.28 --> 02:11:59.28
Time disappears in the internet.

1581
02:11:59.28 --> 02:12:00.28
There's a lot of distractions on there.

1582
02:12:00.28 --> 02:12:01.28
Yeah.

1583
02:12:01.28 --> 02:12:02.28
For sure.

1584
02:12:02.28 --> 02:12:02.28
And really.

1585
02:12:02.28 --> 02:12:07.28
What I mean by distraction is you have this long term goal right your goal is your pay off your long term pay off.

1586
02:12:07.28 --> 02:12:12.28
So so the distractions really are these little short term pay off that drag you that this track.

1587
02:12:12.28 --> 02:12:13.28
You.

1588
02:12:13.28 --> 02:12:15.28
So that's what that's what the distraction is.

1589
02:12:15.28 --> 02:12:17.28
So you broke that out for me.

1590
02:12:17.28 --> 02:12:18.28
Right right.

1591
02:12:18.28 --> 02:12:18.28
But.

1592
02:12:18.28 --> 02:12:19.28
Right.

1593
02:12:19.28 --> 02:12:21.28
Get off the track exactly right.

1594
02:12:21.28 --> 02:12:23.28
So the weakness will let those distractions kind of take place.

1595
02:12:23.28 --> 02:12:24.28
Yeah.

1596
02:12:24.28 --> 02:12:26.28
And then the distractions kind of take hold for sure.

1597
02:12:26.28 --> 02:12:27.28
But.

1598
02:12:27.28 --> 02:12:29.28
So yeah, they work hand in hand for sure.

1599
02:12:29.28 --> 02:12:33.28
So so if you can because again, that saving money for comic books thing.

1600
02:12:33.28 --> 02:12:35.28
So consider that as the goal.

1601
02:12:35.28 --> 02:12:40.28
So the distractions are going to be the candy that you want to buy or the, you know, you play dice with your friend.

1602
02:12:40.28 --> 02:12:43.28
Whatever the distractions is in regards to that specific pack.

1603
02:12:43.28 --> 02:12:45.28
I like echoes world right now.

1604
02:12:45.28 --> 02:12:48.28
Like playing dice with your friend saving for comic books.

1605
02:12:48.28 --> 02:12:49.28
Like 1950.

1606
02:12:49.28 --> 02:12:50.28
So I like it.

1607
02:12:50.28 --> 02:12:51.28
You know, back.

1608
02:12:51.28 --> 02:12:55.28
But either way, like the distractions there they're relevant.

1609
02:12:55.28 --> 02:13:00.28
So when I say, okay, the distractions are there when I say there's industries of distractions.

1610
02:13:00.28 --> 02:13:02.28
Again, I'm not saying this is bad things.

1611
02:13:02.28 --> 02:13:05.28
They are bad things if they're distracting you from your goal.

1612
02:13:05.28 --> 02:13:10.28
So you can have the truth because if you think about it, sometimes you just need to let your mind take a rest.

1613
02:13:10.28 --> 02:13:11.28
Yeah, you need one of them.

1614
02:13:11.28 --> 02:13:13.28
Oh, I got I got to get to just put the game.

1615
02:13:13.28 --> 02:13:18.28
I just flew home from like I've been on the road or all over the world.

1616
02:13:18.28 --> 02:13:22.28
Did the master, did a bunch of speeches, did some consulting.

1617
02:13:22.28 --> 02:13:25.28
It was all over the place on the plane the whole time.

1618
02:13:25.28 --> 02:13:29.28
And I flew home from the East Coast.

1619
02:13:29.28 --> 02:13:32.28
When was that set a couple days ago.

1620
02:13:32.28 --> 02:13:34.28
And when I flew, I haven't done this in forever.

1621
02:13:34.28 --> 02:13:35.28
I flew home.

1622
02:13:35.28 --> 02:13:37.28
I watched a movie.

1623
02:13:37.28 --> 02:13:39.28
I just did a total distraction.

1624
02:13:39.28 --> 02:13:43.28
Because I said, you know what, I can't, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in the game right now.

1625
02:13:43.28 --> 02:13:45.28
Like I need my brain.

1626
02:13:45.28 --> 02:13:48.28
It's the shit off.

1627
02:13:48.28 --> 02:13:51.28
I do something which I don't like to do, which is you can either do two things.

1628
02:13:51.28 --> 02:13:52.28
I look at it.

1629
02:13:52.28 --> 02:13:55.28
You need a consume or you can produce right.

1630
02:13:55.28 --> 02:13:56.28
I want to be producing.

1631
02:13:56.28 --> 02:13:57.28
I want to be putting together.

1632
02:13:57.28 --> 02:13:58.28
I want to be writing.

1633
02:13:58.28 --> 02:13:59.28
I want to be thinking.

1634
02:13:59.28 --> 02:14:01.28
I want to be reading for the podcast.

1635
02:14:01.28 --> 02:14:02.28
Prepping.

1636
02:14:02.28 --> 02:14:03.28
That's what I want to be doing.

1637
02:14:03.28 --> 02:14:04.28
I want to be producing something.

1638
02:14:04.28 --> 02:14:07.28
Consuming is I'm just absorbing what someone else made.

1639
02:14:07.28 --> 02:14:08.28
Right.

1640
02:14:08.28 --> 02:14:11.28
I'm just going to absorb this absorb this absorb this a lot of times it is garbage.

1641
02:14:11.28 --> 02:14:14.28
So, but I flew home had a long flight and I was like, you know what?

1642
02:14:14.28 --> 02:14:17.28
I need to check out, I need to check out right now and just do nothing.

1643
02:14:17.28 --> 02:14:18.28
So I watched two movies.

1644
02:14:18.28 --> 02:14:19.28
Did it get?

1645
02:14:19.28 --> 02:14:20.28
Two movies.

1646
02:14:20.28 --> 02:14:21.28
We got to watch it.

1647
02:14:21.28 --> 02:14:22.28
We got to watch it.

1648
02:14:22.28 --> 02:14:24.28
The two movies I watched.

1649
02:14:24.28 --> 02:14:27.28
The first one was.

1650
02:14:27.28 --> 02:14:31.28
Not heartbreak rich.

1651
02:14:31.28 --> 02:14:39.28
It's the new movie that just came out about Dawson that Mel Gibson directed.

1652
02:14:39.28 --> 02:14:40.28
What's it called?

1653
02:14:40.28 --> 02:14:41.28
I don't know.

1654
02:14:41.28 --> 02:14:43.28
This is a big successful movie.

1655
02:14:43.28 --> 02:14:45.28
Conscious as a projector.

1656
02:14:45.28 --> 02:14:46.28
World War II.

1657
02:14:46.28 --> 02:14:48.28
He wins the Medal of Honor.

1658
02:14:48.28 --> 02:14:50.28
Or he's awarded the Medal of Honor.

1659
02:14:50.28 --> 02:14:51.28
So, that was a good movie.

1660
02:14:51.28 --> 02:14:53.28
You know, it's a World War II movie.

1661
02:14:53.28 --> 02:14:54.28
I liked it.

1662
02:14:54.28 --> 02:14:57.28
It's not in my opinion five star, but it was good.

1663
02:14:57.28 --> 02:14:58.28
It was entertaining.

1664
02:14:58.28 --> 02:14:59.28
Sure.

1665
02:14:59.28 --> 02:15:00.28
It told the story.

1666
02:15:00.28 --> 02:15:04.28
And then after that, I watched.

1667
02:15:04.28 --> 02:15:06.28
Zulander.

1668
02:15:06.28 --> 02:15:09.28
That was when I was going to full-dead press.

1669
02:15:09.28 --> 02:15:10.28
That was good.

1670
02:15:10.28 --> 02:15:11.28
I mean, right.

1671
02:15:11.28 --> 02:15:12.28
I watched Zulander.

1672
02:15:12.28 --> 02:15:14.28
Because it's a hilarious movie.

1673
02:15:14.28 --> 02:15:17.28
I have a buddy in the teams that we nicknamed Moogato.

1674
02:15:17.28 --> 02:15:18.28
Sure.

1675
02:15:18.28 --> 02:15:19.28
Yeah.

1676
02:15:19.28 --> 02:15:20.28
Because, you know, he would go crazy.

1677
02:15:20.28 --> 02:15:22.28
So we had to call him Moogato.

1678
02:15:22.28 --> 02:15:23.28
Yeah.

1679
02:15:23.28 --> 02:15:25.28
And yeah, that was just a funny movie.

1680
02:15:25.28 --> 02:15:26.28
I just decompressed.

1681
02:15:26.28 --> 02:15:27.28
Yeah.

1682
02:15:27.28 --> 02:15:28.28
And I don't do that very often.

1683
02:15:28.28 --> 02:15:29.28
You know.

1684
02:15:29.28 --> 02:15:30.28
The grind is always happelin.

1685
02:15:30.28 --> 02:15:32.28
But I just had to take a little detachment.

1686
02:15:32.28 --> 02:15:33.28
What was the name of that movie?

1687
02:15:33.28 --> 02:15:34.28
With...

1688
02:15:34.28 --> 02:15:37.28
There's not famous actors.

1689
02:15:37.28 --> 02:15:38.28
I guess there's one.

1690
02:15:38.28 --> 02:15:40.28
Who's the really funny guy?

1691
02:15:40.28 --> 02:15:41.28
Anyways.

1692
02:15:41.28 --> 02:15:42.28
Is it a good movie?

1693
02:15:42.28 --> 02:15:43.28
Yeah.

1694
02:15:43.28 --> 02:15:47.28
So techno what the so the question is, is that really a distraction?

1695
02:15:47.28 --> 02:15:54.28
So, you know, like a football game or a movie or something that you're not doing to put you,

1696
02:15:54.28 --> 02:15:56.28
you know, more forward on your path or whatever.

1697
02:15:56.28 --> 02:16:00.28
But if you're taking a break, is that a distraction?

1698
02:16:00.28 --> 02:16:03.28
Like if I'm lifting, and I do a workout, and then I go recover from that workout.

1699
02:16:03.28 --> 02:16:04.28
Yeah.

1700
02:16:04.28 --> 02:16:05.28
The rest of it is that a distraction.

1701
02:16:05.28 --> 02:16:06.28
No.

1702
02:16:06.28 --> 02:16:07.28
It's a distraction.

1703
02:16:07.28 --> 02:16:08.28
I should have grinded it though.

1704
02:16:08.28 --> 02:16:09.28
Yeah.

1705
02:16:09.28 --> 02:16:10.28
No.

1706
02:16:10.28 --> 02:16:11.28
I was done.

1707
02:16:11.28 --> 02:16:12.28
So it tapped out.

1708
02:16:12.28 --> 02:16:15.28
So a distraction is more of an idea and more of the concept, you know.

1709
02:16:15.28 --> 02:16:16.28
So like you're definitely an executive director.

1710
02:16:16.28 --> 02:16:20.28
Just like how you said when you open your computer, and the whole internet is there to distract you.

1711
02:16:20.28 --> 02:16:21.28
Oh.

1712
02:16:21.28 --> 02:16:22.28
What do we have now there?

1713
02:16:22.28 --> 02:16:23.28
Yeah.

1714
02:16:23.28 --> 02:16:24.28
That's a distraction.

1715
02:16:24.28 --> 02:16:29.28
You know, where you can, like even if I have a book, if my goal is to finish some video,

1716
02:16:29.28 --> 02:16:32.28
but meanwhile, I have this book that's really informative and something.

1717
02:16:32.28 --> 02:16:35.28
And I'm like, you know, that book seems real.

1718
02:16:35.28 --> 02:16:36.28
I'm real in the mood to read that book.

1719
02:16:36.28 --> 02:16:38.28
That's a distraction, even though it's a good thing.

1720
02:16:38.28 --> 02:16:41.28
You know, so the distraction is like the idea.

1721
02:16:41.28 --> 02:16:43.28
So, you know, what are the common goals?

1722
02:16:43.28 --> 02:16:44.28
I want to get in shape.

1723
02:16:44.28 --> 02:16:49.28
I want to, you know, be a better husband or wife or I want to do better at work.

1724
02:16:49.28 --> 02:16:50.28
I want to learn more.

1725
02:16:50.28 --> 02:16:51.28
I want to read all the stuff.

1726
02:16:51.28 --> 02:16:52.28
Get better at your attention.

1727
02:16:52.28 --> 02:16:53.28
Get better at your attention.

1728
02:16:53.28 --> 02:16:56.28
All the stuff you can get distracted by these other things.

1729
02:16:56.28 --> 02:16:58.28
You know, before I, I don't know, read.

1730
02:16:58.28 --> 02:17:01.28
I'm going to surf Instagram or something like that.

1731
02:17:01.28 --> 02:17:02.28
That's a distraction.

1732
02:17:02.28 --> 02:17:03.28
You know.

1733
02:17:03.28 --> 02:17:07.28
And now, which is my original point is.

1734
02:17:07.28 --> 02:17:20.28
The reason or one of the reasons that we don't apply this extreme discipline as it's outlined in these books here is because we have literally infinite amount of distraction.

1735
02:17:20.28 --> 02:17:23.28
Well, there's also no consequence or I shouldn't say that.

1736
02:17:23.28 --> 02:17:25.28
The consequence isn't visible.

1737
02:17:25.28 --> 02:17:25.28
Yeah.

1738
02:17:25.28 --> 02:17:32.28
The consequence you don't say, you don't say, hey, if I would have had this one, I would reach this ultimate potential.

1739
02:17:32.28 --> 02:17:34.28
You just, okay, with not reaching that ultimate potential.

1740
02:17:34.28 --> 02:17:38.28
Yeah.

1741
02:17:38.28 --> 02:17:40.28
You're just like turning, putting microwaveable popcorn in and watching him move.

1742
02:17:40.28 --> 02:17:41.28
You've been doing it the whole time.

1743
02:17:41.28 --> 02:17:42.28
I'm still here.

1744
02:17:42.28 --> 02:17:43.28
You know, I'm here.

1745
02:17:43.28 --> 02:17:44.28
I know.

1746
02:17:44.28 --> 02:17:45.28
And you know what?

1747
02:17:45.28 --> 02:17:46.28
That was a good movie.

1748
02:17:46.28 --> 02:17:47.28
And the popcorn tastes good.

1749
02:17:47.28 --> 02:17:48.28
That's the wrong answer.

1750
02:17:48.28 --> 02:17:49.28
Yeah.

1751
02:17:49.28 --> 02:17:51.28
You don't recognize what your potential is.

1752
02:17:51.28 --> 02:17:54.28
And so you're just okay with this kind of half potential.

1753
02:17:54.28 --> 02:17:55.28
You don't reach your potential.

1754
02:17:55.28 --> 02:17:58.28
And since you don't know it.

1755
02:17:58.28 --> 02:18:01.28
And the other thing it's hard to see, it's hard to see how that long term effects you.

1756
02:18:01.28 --> 02:18:04.28
Yeah, I got just one bag of popcorn is just one movie.

1757
02:18:04.28 --> 02:18:05.28
Yeah.

1758
02:18:05.28 --> 02:18:06.28
But you did that three times this week.

1759
02:18:06.28 --> 02:18:07.28
Yeah.

1760
02:18:07.28 --> 02:18:09.28
You know, that's, that's not getting you two times.

1761
02:18:09.28 --> 02:18:10.28
You know, in the past 10 years.

1762
02:18:10.28 --> 02:18:11.28
Yeah.

1763
02:18:11.28 --> 02:18:12.28
You could write 30,000 words.

1764
02:18:12.28 --> 02:18:13.28
No, more than that.

1765
02:18:13.28 --> 02:18:14.28
Yeah.

1766
02:18:14.28 --> 02:18:15.28
You're right about 1,000 words an hour.

1767
02:18:15.28 --> 02:18:17.28
Good way to look at it.

1768
02:18:17.28 --> 02:18:20.28
And I think I might have said this for where.

1769
02:18:20.28 --> 02:18:24.28
It's not like a moment to moment looking to the future kind of thing.

1770
02:18:24.28 --> 02:18:26.28
You should look at it.

1771
02:18:26.28 --> 02:18:30.28
But in the way of, in the sense of looking at it in the past.

1772
02:18:30.28 --> 02:18:34.28
So let's say you consider the last one year or two years.

1773
02:18:34.28 --> 02:18:35.28
Right.

1774
02:18:35.28 --> 02:18:37.28
And let's say I wanted to play better guitar.

1775
02:18:37.28 --> 02:18:38.28
Something.

1776
02:18:38.28 --> 02:18:39.28
Good goal.

1777
02:18:39.28 --> 02:18:40.28
Yeah.

1778
02:18:40.28 --> 02:18:41.28
I have that goal.

1779
02:18:41.28 --> 02:18:42.28
I always fail at it.

1780
02:18:42.28 --> 02:18:43.28
There you go.

1781
02:18:43.28 --> 02:18:45.28
So you look at it in this way where you don't say, okay.

1782
02:18:45.28 --> 02:18:51.28
If I spend an hour a day, you know, practicing guitar in, you know, in a year, all be better.

1783
02:18:51.28 --> 02:18:52.28
You don't necessarily look like that.

1784
02:18:52.28 --> 02:18:53.28
You can.

1785
02:18:53.28 --> 02:18:59.28
But a good way to look at it or help with it is if you look at it last year.

1786
02:18:59.28 --> 02:19:03.28
If I, if I would have played an hour a day right now, I would right now.

1787
02:19:03.28 --> 02:19:05.28
That is I'm sitting here with you right now.

1788
02:19:05.28 --> 02:19:08.28
I'd be dope at guitar, you know, kind of like that.

1789
02:19:08.28 --> 02:19:10.28
So you kind of get the wall in my experience.

1790
02:19:10.28 --> 02:19:13.28
I've kind of got this feeling of like wasted time.

1791
02:19:13.28 --> 02:19:15.28
You know, you know that feeling where it's like dang.

1792
02:19:15.28 --> 02:19:16.28
I got to play catch up.

1793
02:19:16.28 --> 02:19:18.28
No, that's a little bit more compelling.

1794
02:19:18.28 --> 02:19:19.28
I think sometimes it can be.

1795
02:19:19.28 --> 02:19:20.28
Yeah.

1796
02:19:20.28 --> 02:19:23.28
So if you think about it that way too, I think that helps.

1797
02:19:23.28 --> 02:19:26.28
Maybe maybe not speaking of help.

1798
02:19:26.28 --> 02:19:27.28
Speaking of help.

1799
02:19:27.28 --> 02:19:28.28
And potential.

1800
02:19:28.28 --> 02:19:33.28
Oh, both nicely done double gravitational.

1801
02:19:33.28 --> 02:19:36.28
You need help.

1802
02:19:36.28 --> 02:19:38.28
By way of supplementation.

1803
02:19:38.28 --> 02:19:39.28
If you're working out.

1804
02:19:39.28 --> 02:19:41.28
So I mean, how you said.

1805
02:19:41.28 --> 02:19:43.28
You can't not work out.

1806
02:19:43.28 --> 02:19:46.28
I think especially nowadays, like you could because your life.

1807
02:19:46.28 --> 02:19:47.28
To.

1808
02:19:47.28 --> 02:19:50.28
Probability wise is is is is cruising.

1809
02:19:50.28 --> 02:19:52.28
You're cruising physically.

1810
02:19:52.28 --> 02:19:55.28
Where, you know, you go to office because really.

1811
02:19:55.28 --> 02:19:58.28
Yeah, life is physically easy.

1812
02:19:58.28 --> 02:19:59.28
Right.

1813
02:19:59.28 --> 02:20:00.28
You're an emotional and kids easier and easier.

1814
02:20:00.28 --> 02:20:02.28
Even if it's not easy right now.

1815
02:20:02.28 --> 02:20:05.28
Next year generally speaking, it's going to be easier.

1816
02:20:05.28 --> 02:20:11.28
You know, like even like slow and brushed in my teeth, like I do every week or whatever.

1817
02:20:11.28 --> 02:20:13.28
And once a week, whether you're not.

1818
02:20:13.28 --> 02:20:14.28
Yeah.

1819
02:20:14.28 --> 02:20:19.28
And so I have the regular toothbrush, you know, I'm sure this all kinds of little

1820
02:20:19.28 --> 02:20:21.28
micro technologies in the toothbrush.

1821
02:20:21.28 --> 02:20:24.28
But I started to think man, this there have, you know, this is a old school thing.

1822
02:20:24.28 --> 02:20:26.28
There's automatic toothbrushes.

1823
02:20:26.28 --> 02:20:30.28
Actually, my brother told me about this too, this automatic, you know, electric toothbrush

1824
02:20:30.28 --> 02:20:32.28
I was like super dope and highly recommended it.

1825
02:20:32.28 --> 02:20:34.28
It was like $89 all this stuff.

1826
02:20:34.28 --> 02:20:39.28
And I'm thinking dang something as basic as brushing your teeth is way easier now.

1827
02:20:39.28 --> 02:20:40.28
Way easier.

1828
02:20:40.28 --> 02:20:41.28
You got a machine to do it.

1829
02:20:41.28 --> 02:20:45.28
That's that's really the whole narrative with everything.

1830
02:20:45.28 --> 02:20:47.28
Point being.

1831
02:20:47.28 --> 02:20:48.28
Physically.

1832
02:20:48.28 --> 02:20:51.28
You're in first yourself because you're not going to have to push it.

1833
02:20:51.28 --> 02:20:52.28
You got to read it.

1834
02:20:52.28 --> 02:20:56.28
Yeah, yeah, yeah, your environment is starting to work more and more against you.

1835
02:20:56.28 --> 02:20:58.28
In regards to physical activity.

1836
02:20:58.28 --> 02:21:00.28
So my point being.

1837
02:21:00.28 --> 02:21:02.28
You got to work out.

1838
02:21:02.28 --> 02:21:03.28
Yeah, how's it going to say?

1839
02:21:03.28 --> 02:21:05.28
That's a real straightforward thing.

1840
02:21:05.28 --> 02:21:06.28
Work out.

1841
02:21:06.28 --> 02:21:10.28
Yeah, but I feel like it's, I mean, it's easy for you, you know, to be like,

1842
02:21:10.28 --> 02:21:11.28
Yeah, it's you.

1843
02:21:11.28 --> 02:21:14.28
It's obvious, you know, they call that the curse a knowledge, you know,

1844
02:21:14.28 --> 02:21:18.28
home when you're, you're like so advanced in this one thing that you forget how it is

1845
02:21:18.28 --> 02:21:19.28
to not be advanced.

1846
02:21:19.28 --> 02:21:20.28
Yeah, that's true.

1847
02:21:20.28 --> 02:21:25.28
I have forgotten what it's like to not be advanced in in terms of trying to explain to people why they

1848
02:21:25.28 --> 02:21:27.28
well, I think it's pretty self-loving into anybody.

1849
02:21:27.28 --> 02:21:28.28
Why you to work out.

1850
02:21:28.28 --> 02:21:29.28
No, you're wrong.

1851
02:21:29.28 --> 02:21:30.28
Yeah, okay.

1852
02:21:30.28 --> 02:21:32.28
Think about this and I think about, and I thought about this one.

1853
02:21:32.28 --> 02:21:34.28
Like, okay, you know, when you go into a jiu-jitsu gym,

1854
02:21:34.28 --> 02:21:35.28
okay, you're different.

1855
02:21:35.28 --> 02:21:38.28
So you may, you could very well, not even understand this.

1856
02:21:38.28 --> 02:21:40.28
This might not compute with you.

1857
02:21:40.28 --> 02:21:43.28
But if you walk into a jiu-jitsu gym and this applies to even a regular 24-hour

1858
02:21:43.28 --> 02:21:46.28
fitness gym, if you've never been in there before, it never worked out.

1859
02:21:46.28 --> 02:21:48.28
That's a really intimidating thing.

1860
02:21:48.28 --> 02:21:50.28
You come in.

1861
02:21:50.28 --> 02:21:52.28
If you're looking at me, I don't know how to use the machines.

1862
02:21:52.28 --> 02:21:53.28
I don't know how to work out.

1863
02:21:53.28 --> 02:21:54.28
Like everyone's looking at me.

1864
02:21:54.28 --> 02:21:55.28
Judging me, I'm dumb.

1865
02:21:55.28 --> 02:21:56.28
It is not my element.

1866
02:21:56.28 --> 02:21:58.28
All this stuff that's intimidating, you know?

1867
02:22:00.28 --> 02:22:01.28
Okay.

1868
02:22:01.28 --> 02:22:02.28
But it's real.

1869
02:22:02.28 --> 02:22:05.28
What I'm saying, you know how you say it, like you probably don't know about that because you

1870
02:22:05.28 --> 02:22:08.28
don't have the curse of knowledge in regards to physical activity working out.

1871
02:22:08.28 --> 02:22:09.28
You know, all that stuff.

1872
02:22:09.28 --> 02:22:12.28
And then the pain that comes with it, I, man, I dig it.

1873
02:22:12.28 --> 02:22:13.28
I understand.

1874
02:22:13.28 --> 02:22:16.28
But that's even more of a reason to work out.

1875
02:22:16.28 --> 02:22:19.28
Physical condition.

1876
02:22:19.28 --> 02:22:21.28
Anyway, you've invited it if you don't work out.

1877
02:22:21.28 --> 02:22:22.28
Just jump in there.

1878
02:22:22.28 --> 02:22:23.28
Jump in.

1879
02:22:23.28 --> 02:22:24.28
Go to the gym.

1880
02:22:24.28 --> 02:22:27.28
Last year, if you were to start it working out, you know,

1881
02:22:27.28 --> 02:22:33.28
how dope you be right now, way dopeer than you are if in the event you didn't start last

1882
02:22:33.28 --> 02:22:34.28
last year, seems like.

1883
02:22:34.28 --> 02:22:38.28
Anyway, while you work out, you've joined some might be kind of sore.

1884
02:22:38.28 --> 02:22:40.28
I know this from experience.

1885
02:22:40.28 --> 02:22:42.28
Take cruel oil.

1886
02:22:42.28 --> 02:22:44.28
My father and Lothermy on to it.

1887
02:22:44.28 --> 02:22:47.28
Actually, technically, didn't successfully turn me on to it.

1888
02:22:47.28 --> 02:22:48.28
But he tried.

1889
02:22:48.28 --> 02:22:52.28
He tried and, you know, I didn't see the light until

1890
02:22:52.28 --> 02:22:53.28
Jockel turned me on to it.

1891
02:22:53.28 --> 02:22:55.28
So now I'm turning everyone else on to it.

1892
02:22:55.28 --> 02:22:57.28
Hopefully, successfully.

1893
02:22:57.28 --> 02:22:59.28
Crill oil is.

1894
02:22:59.28 --> 02:23:02.28
I'm not going to go into a whole deep thing here, but it's for your joint.

1895
02:23:02.28 --> 02:23:05.28
So if you get joint pain, we'll just with degeneration over time.

1896
02:23:05.28 --> 02:23:06.28
You get older.

1897
02:23:06.28 --> 02:23:07.28
Dig it.

1898
02:23:07.28 --> 02:23:09.28
Crill oil will bring you back.

1899
02:23:09.28 --> 02:23:10.28
They'll function.

1900
02:23:10.28 --> 02:23:13.28
It's kind of like your joint joint sort of like always warm now.

1901
02:23:13.28 --> 02:23:16.28
Not like to the touch warm, but like warm like ready for action.

1902
02:23:16.28 --> 02:23:17.28
You see what I'm saying.

1903
02:23:17.28 --> 02:23:19.28
Anyway, Crill oil.

1904
02:23:19.28 --> 02:23:20.28
I ain't even say it by who?

1905
02:23:20.28 --> 02:23:24.28
If you don't know on it, that's the whole company and they have, they don't have just

1906
02:23:24.28 --> 02:23:25.28
Crill oil.

1907
02:23:25.28 --> 02:23:26.28
They have other stuff too.

1908
02:23:26.28 --> 02:23:27.28
They also have a different deck.

1909
02:23:27.28 --> 02:23:29.28
Yeah, performance stuff, which I remember.

1910
02:23:29.28 --> 02:23:31.28
I recommend you to take by the way.

1911
02:23:31.28 --> 02:23:34.28
Big time, especially if you're going for performance.

1912
02:23:34.28 --> 02:23:42.28
Yeah, if you're going to go, train you Jitsu with Andy Taylor, Dean, Craig Baker.

1913
02:23:42.28 --> 02:23:43.28
Yeah.

1914
02:23:43.28 --> 02:23:44.28
Greg Train.

1915
02:23:44.28 --> 02:23:46.28
Echo Charles.

1916
02:23:46.28 --> 02:23:47.28
Just take the shrimp.

1917
02:23:47.28 --> 02:23:48.28
And you know what?

1918
02:23:48.28 --> 02:23:49.28
Support.

1919
02:23:49.28 --> 02:23:50.28
Yeah, shrimp touch sport.

1920
02:23:50.28 --> 02:23:51.28
Take three of them.

1921
02:23:51.28 --> 02:23:52.28
Oh, is that the front?

1922
02:23:52.28 --> 02:23:53.28
No, that's the recommended.

1923
02:23:53.28 --> 02:23:54.28
I didn't know that.

1924
02:23:54.28 --> 02:23:55.28
And then I read it.

1925
02:23:55.28 --> 02:23:58.28
Yeah, I've like one day I just read the instructions for no reason.

1926
02:23:58.28 --> 02:24:02.28
I was like, I wonder if I take 12 of these things if I'll be even more attack.

1927
02:24:02.28 --> 02:24:04.28
But I did say three because I've been taken two.

1928
02:24:04.28 --> 02:24:05.28
Oh, for real?

1929
02:24:05.28 --> 02:24:06.28
Sorry, took three.

1930
02:24:06.28 --> 02:24:08.28
It felt a little bit legit.

1931
02:24:08.28 --> 02:24:10.28
Yeah, we stick three in.

1932
02:24:10.28 --> 02:24:11.28
Never let down.

1933
02:24:11.28 --> 02:24:12.28
And again, that's for the performance.

1934
02:24:12.28 --> 02:24:17.28
So if I'm just cruising, if I'm just taking a walk around the block or two, I take

1935
02:24:17.28 --> 02:24:18.28
the shrimp tech.

1936
02:24:18.28 --> 02:24:20.28
I'm not going to feel it as much as if I jump in.

1937
02:24:20.28 --> 02:24:22.28
Jiu Jitsu rounds.

1938
02:24:22.28 --> 02:24:23.28
You know?

1939
02:24:23.28 --> 02:24:28.28
Yeah, no, you think I take it when I have to perform a situation.

1940
02:24:28.28 --> 02:24:29.28
Yeah, big time.

1941
02:24:29.28 --> 02:24:30.28
Me too.

1942
02:24:30.28 --> 02:24:31.28
You take shrimp tech immune.

1943
02:24:31.28 --> 02:24:33.28
Not to be confused with.

1944
02:24:33.28 --> 02:24:36.28
And I've taken shrimp tech immune when I go massive travel.

1945
02:24:36.28 --> 02:24:37.28
Yeah.

1946
02:24:37.28 --> 02:24:38.28
She getting all these planes.

1947
02:24:38.28 --> 02:24:39.28
Oh, yeah.

1948
02:24:39.28 --> 02:24:41.28
I think we're all in different sneezing.

1949
02:24:41.28 --> 02:24:42.28
It's all nasty.

1950
02:24:42.28 --> 02:24:43.28
I know what I do.

1951
02:24:43.28 --> 02:24:45.28
Just go ahead and take some shrimp tech immune.

1952
02:24:45.28 --> 02:24:47.28
It's something different because the yellowish.

1953
02:24:47.28 --> 02:24:50.28
It's the labeled green too, though.

1954
02:24:50.28 --> 02:24:54.28
The, whatever you're eating is more yellow.

1955
02:24:54.28 --> 02:24:57.28
Yeah, I think the ingredients will just say the ingredients.

1956
02:24:57.28 --> 02:24:58.28
I take vitamin C.

1957
02:24:58.28 --> 02:25:02.28
Actually, when I'm a big travel, vitamin C, shrimp tech immune.

1958
02:25:02.28 --> 02:25:04.28
Here's zinc is a good one too.

1959
02:25:04.28 --> 02:25:05.28
That's what I hear.

1960
02:25:05.28 --> 02:25:08.28
I've taken zinc before to try and overcome a cold,

1961
02:25:08.28 --> 02:25:11.28
but it wasn't very, you know, convinced.

1962
02:25:11.28 --> 02:25:12.28
Yeah.

1963
02:25:12.28 --> 02:25:12.28
Yeah.

1964
02:25:12.28 --> 02:25:14.28
I can power, I will power some vitamin C though.

1965
02:25:14.28 --> 02:25:17.28
If I feel like some kind of a disease coming on,

1966
02:25:17.28 --> 02:25:17.28
yeah.

1967
02:25:17.28 --> 02:25:18.28
Power, the vitamin C.

1968
02:25:18.28 --> 02:25:20.28
See, and that's kind of the good thing where you take this,

1969
02:25:20.28 --> 02:25:21.28
um,

1970
02:25:21.28 --> 02:25:22.28
shrimp tech immune.

1971
02:25:22.28 --> 02:25:23.28
Yeah.

1972
02:25:23.28 --> 02:25:25.28
Like, you know, you know that they were like,

1973
02:25:25.28 --> 02:25:26.28
okay, does vitamin C help?

1974
02:25:26.28 --> 02:25:27.28
Okay, check.

1975
02:25:27.28 --> 02:25:29.28
It does zinc in, I don't know.

1976
02:25:29.28 --> 02:25:31.28
I didn't read the ingredients like you did.

1977
02:25:31.28 --> 02:25:33.28
And thought we were about to, whatever.

1978
02:25:33.28 --> 02:25:34.28
But I read the effects.

1979
02:25:34.28 --> 02:25:35.28
Yeah, okay, got you.

1980
02:25:35.28 --> 02:25:36.28
Raise my immune system.

1981
02:25:36.28 --> 02:25:39.28
I'm going to need that plane, a bunch of dirty people.

1982
02:25:39.28 --> 02:25:41.28
Not all of you, but many of you.

1983
02:25:41.28 --> 02:25:42.28
Many sneezing.

1984
02:25:42.28 --> 02:25:45.28
It's sneezing on everyone, coughing on everyone.

1985
02:25:45.28 --> 02:25:46.28
Yeah.

1986
02:25:46.28 --> 02:25:48.28
And by the way, because I'm going to go talk to people,

1987
02:25:48.28 --> 02:25:49.28
I can't be going.

1988
02:25:49.28 --> 02:25:50.28
No, no.

1989
02:25:50.28 --> 02:25:51.28
I'm not going.

1990
02:25:51.28 --> 02:25:52.28
Or, yeah, I can't do that.

1991
02:25:52.28 --> 02:25:54.28
I have to actually be able to talk.

1992
02:25:54.28 --> 02:25:55.28
Yeah, coughing, seeing it.

1993
02:25:55.28 --> 02:25:56.28
Yeah, coughing.

1994
02:25:56.28 --> 02:25:57.28
Yeah, I can't be.

1995
02:25:57.28 --> 02:26:02.28
It's awful if you, if you sneeze or cough when you're on a mic

1996
02:26:02.28 --> 02:26:04.28
in front of a big group of people, not cool.

1997
02:26:04.28 --> 02:26:06.28
Or if you keep doing it, yeah.

1998
02:26:06.28 --> 02:26:07.28
Yeah, I kind of do it.

1999
02:26:07.28 --> 02:26:08.28
Shroom tech.

2000
02:26:08.28 --> 02:26:09.28
Shroom tech.

2001
02:26:09.28 --> 02:26:10.28
Shroom tech.

2002
02:26:10.28 --> 02:26:11.28
You know of a good stuff.

2003
02:26:11.28 --> 02:26:12.28
And they okay.

2004
02:26:12.28 --> 02:26:13.28
Yes, on it.com.

2005
02:26:13.28 --> 02:26:15.28
You want 10% off all this stuff on it.

2006
02:26:15.28 --> 02:26:17.28
Come slash, jockel.

2007
02:26:17.28 --> 02:26:18.28
And here's the thing.

2008
02:26:18.28 --> 02:26:19.28
We just talked about right now.

2009
02:26:19.28 --> 02:26:20.28
We talked about krill oil.

2010
02:26:20.28 --> 02:26:21.28
Shroom tech sports.

2011
02:26:21.28 --> 02:26:22.28
Shroom tech immune.

2012
02:26:22.28 --> 02:26:23.28
Alphabet.

2013
02:26:23.28 --> 02:26:24.28
Yeah, Alphabet.

2014
02:26:24.28 --> 02:26:26.28
Oh, we could go all night with this.

2015
02:26:26.28 --> 02:26:28.28
Because of all the good stuff.

2016
02:26:28.28 --> 02:26:29.28
I did.

2017
02:26:29.28 --> 02:26:30.28
You watched me actually.

2018
02:26:30.28 --> 02:26:31.28
Yeah, I did.

2019
02:26:31.28 --> 02:26:32.28
I got Alphabet today.

2020
02:26:32.28 --> 02:26:34.28
And I was thinking you took it, but then when you wanted

2021
02:26:34.28 --> 02:26:37.28
not long story about something, and I was sort of wondering,

2022
02:26:37.28 --> 02:26:38.28
maybe he didn't take his Alphabet today.

2023
02:26:38.28 --> 02:26:40.28
Oh, then, then when I wrapped it up, you were like,

2024
02:26:40.28 --> 02:26:41.28
Did you want that Alphabet?

2025
02:26:41.28 --> 02:26:43.28
No, he was all out of Alphabet.

2026
02:26:43.28 --> 02:26:44.28
I didn't sit.

2027
02:26:44.28 --> 02:26:45.28
Alphabet.

2028
02:26:45.28 --> 02:26:47.28
That statement made me think you are an Alphabet today.

2029
02:26:47.28 --> 02:26:49.28
Just because you were able to complete your whole deal right there.

2030
02:26:49.28 --> 02:26:51.28
I'm going to get it to Alphabet.

2031
02:26:51.28 --> 02:26:52.28
Just an Echo story.

2032
02:26:52.28 --> 02:26:54.28
And then when it comes to the closure, you go,

2033
02:26:54.28 --> 02:26:56.28
back and again, some of that.

2034
02:26:56.28 --> 02:26:57.28
Exactly.

2035
02:26:57.28 --> 02:26:58.28
Right.

2036
02:26:58.28 --> 02:26:59.28
See, hey, it could take lead.

2037
02:26:59.28 --> 02:27:01.28
Take my lead example.

2038
02:27:01.28 --> 02:27:02.28
You know, I don't see.

2039
02:27:02.28 --> 02:27:09.28
So Alphabet, if you don't know, because we haven't talked about it as much as I feel like as far as it's role in our lives.

2040
02:27:09.28 --> 02:27:13.28
My life, you know, I'm speaking from myself, where you take it neutral.

2041
02:27:13.28 --> 02:27:14.28
It's called neutral pick.

2042
02:27:14.28 --> 02:27:20.28
It's basically brain food, brain supplement, you know, like to make your brain.

2043
02:27:20.28 --> 02:27:21.28
No, I'm going to get it.

2044
02:27:21.28 --> 02:27:24.28
I'm going to get it to because I've been taking mostly on it,

2045
02:27:24.28 --> 02:27:27.28
mostly Alphabet in the pack and the powder.

2046
02:27:27.28 --> 02:27:28.28
Can taste good?

2047
02:27:28.28 --> 02:27:28.28
Yeah.

2048
02:27:28.28 --> 02:27:29.28
Yeah.

2049
02:27:29.28 --> 02:27:30.28
The peach and the spice spice.

2050
02:27:30.28 --> 02:27:32.28
I've been taking it in that more than I'm going to get.

2051
02:27:32.28 --> 02:27:35.28
I actually ran out of the pills.

2052
02:27:35.28 --> 02:27:36.28
Yeah.

2053
02:27:36.28 --> 02:27:37.28
The capsules.

2054
02:27:37.28 --> 02:27:39.28
Wait, so you let you prefer the capsules.

2055
02:27:39.28 --> 02:27:42.28
You're seeing well, sometimes capsules a little bit more convenient.

2056
02:27:42.28 --> 02:27:42.28
Right.

2057
02:27:42.28 --> 02:27:43.28
Yeah.

2058
02:27:43.28 --> 02:27:44.28
But I like it.

2059
02:27:44.28 --> 02:27:47.28
If I'm doing an event or I'm going to go on a podcast.

2060
02:27:47.28 --> 02:27:48.28
Yeah.

2061
02:27:48.28 --> 02:27:49.28
And I didn't.

2062
02:27:49.28 --> 02:27:50.28
I want to just build a band.

2063
02:27:50.28 --> 02:27:52.28
Makes it smell for Brady in the in the brain.

2064
02:27:52.28 --> 02:27:54.28
See, about your own is in a hurry.

2065
02:27:54.28 --> 02:27:55.28
Doing a bunch of stuff.

2066
02:27:55.28 --> 02:27:56.28
Brow him makes it up.

2067
02:27:56.28 --> 02:27:57.28
A little fruit.

2068
02:27:57.28 --> 02:27:59.28
Well, you know, like when you brew tea, it's like,

2069
02:27:59.28 --> 02:28:00.28
I don't know.

2070
02:28:00.28 --> 02:28:02.28
It's all like spring anyway.

2071
02:28:02.28 --> 02:28:04.28
Either way, they're both the same deal.

2072
02:28:04.28 --> 02:28:07.28
And they're called neutral picks.

2073
02:28:07.28 --> 02:28:08.28
Proving by the way.

2074
02:28:08.28 --> 02:28:10.28
I'm not just saying what if you're good for me?

2075
02:28:10.28 --> 02:28:11.28
So you should take it.

2076
02:28:11.28 --> 02:28:12.28
I'm not just saying that.

2077
02:28:12.28 --> 02:28:15.28
Now, when you say that, you know,

2078
02:28:15.28 --> 02:28:18.28
but to me, that means more to me than I don't know why.

2079
02:28:18.28 --> 02:28:20.28
But like when you say, oh, it's been double triple blind.

2080
02:28:20.28 --> 02:28:22.28
Plus evil, blah, blah, blah control.

2081
02:28:22.28 --> 02:28:24.28
But I would rather have like someone that I know.

2082
02:28:24.28 --> 02:28:26.28
Say, bro, I'm telling you take this stuff.

2083
02:28:26.28 --> 02:28:27.28
Like I did with growing old to you.

2084
02:28:27.28 --> 02:28:28.28
Yeah.

2085
02:28:28.28 --> 02:28:29.28
Yeah.

2086
02:28:29.28 --> 02:28:31.28
That was more important than reading a bunch of facts about it.

2087
02:28:31.28 --> 02:28:32.28
Yeah.

2088
02:28:32.28 --> 02:28:33.28
Yeah.

2089
02:28:33.28 --> 02:28:34.28
And that takes someone that you know.

2090
02:28:34.28 --> 02:28:37.28
And they're saying, look, man, give it a little crack.

2091
02:28:37.28 --> 02:28:38.28
Yeah.

2092
02:28:38.28 --> 02:28:39.28
Trust me on this one.

2093
02:28:39.28 --> 02:28:41.28
And I think most people have that in one way or another, not with everything.

2094
02:28:41.28 --> 02:28:44.28
But yeah, like if you recommend a movie or something like that,

2095
02:28:44.28 --> 02:28:46.28
and then mean while looking at the reviews,

2096
02:28:46.28 --> 02:28:48.28
the reviews are like super good.

2097
02:28:48.28 --> 02:28:51.28
But then you're like, eh, it was junk because it's because of that.

2098
02:28:51.28 --> 02:28:53.28
It's like it's an awesome experience.

2099
02:28:53.28 --> 02:28:54.28
I've watched it move in so long.

2100
02:28:54.28 --> 02:28:55.28
Yeah.

2101
02:28:55.28 --> 02:28:57.28
Right to the classic 90s.

2102
02:28:57.28 --> 02:28:58.28
It's at 90s comedy.

2103
02:28:58.28 --> 02:29:00.28
What kind of mood is jacquilin when I go to 90s?

2104
02:29:00.28 --> 02:29:01.28
Oh, is it like your friend?

2105
02:29:01.28 --> 02:29:02.28
Yeah.

2106
02:29:02.28 --> 02:29:03.28
That's just ridiculous.

2107
02:29:03.28 --> 02:29:05.28
That's just ridiculous.

2108
02:29:05.28 --> 02:29:08.28
But I like, oh, is it Owen Wilson in that movie?

2109
02:29:08.28 --> 02:29:09.28
No, the other one.

2110
02:29:09.28 --> 02:29:10.28
Oh, yeah.

2111
02:29:10.28 --> 02:29:11.28
Sorry.

2112
02:29:11.28 --> 02:29:12.28
Yeah.

2113
02:29:12.28 --> 02:29:13.28
I'm thinking Bencil.

2114
02:29:13.28 --> 02:29:14.28
I like that guy, Owen Wilson.

2115
02:29:14.28 --> 02:29:15.28
Yeah.

2116
02:29:15.28 --> 02:29:16.28
He's funny.

2117
02:29:16.28 --> 02:29:20.28
I like him because he comes across as very truthful in the way he says.

2118
02:29:20.28 --> 02:29:21.28
Yeah.

2119
02:29:21.28 --> 02:29:22.28
Yeah.

2120
02:29:22.28 --> 02:29:23.28
Yeah.

2121
02:29:23.28 --> 02:29:24.28
Yeah.

2122
02:29:24.28 --> 02:29:25.28
Yeah.

2123
02:29:25.28 --> 02:29:26.28
Yeah.

2124
02:29:26.28 --> 02:29:27.28
Yeah.

2125
02:29:27.28 --> 02:29:27.28
Yeah.

2126
02:29:27.28 --> 02:29:28.28
Yeah.

2127
02:29:28.28 --> 02:29:29.28
He's kind of got this air about him.

2128
02:29:29.28 --> 02:29:30.28
That's pretty air.

2129
02:29:30.28 --> 02:29:31.28
Pretty air.

2130
02:29:31.28 --> 02:29:32.28
Yeah.

2131
02:29:32.28 --> 02:29:33.28
Yeah.

2132
02:29:33.28 --> 02:29:34.28
It's interesting.

2133
02:29:34.28 --> 02:29:35.28
Nonetheless, back to the Alphabrine.

2134
02:29:35.28 --> 02:29:39.28
I think that when they prove it, I think certain people, certain types of like mindsets

2135
02:29:39.28 --> 02:29:41.28
or whatever kind of more gravitate towards that.

2136
02:29:41.28 --> 02:29:44.28
Like they're like, okay, that's cool that it worked for you, but that could have been

2137
02:29:44.28 --> 02:29:45.28
placebo.

2138
02:29:45.28 --> 02:29:46.28
That could have been this.

2139
02:29:46.28 --> 02:29:47.28
That could have been your mood that day or whatever.

2140
02:29:47.28 --> 02:29:50.28
If I'm going to commit to this, I want some, I want some hard facts.

2141
02:29:50.28 --> 02:29:55.96
Some people will say, so boom, you got the hard facts as well as a legitimate

2142
02:29:55.96 --> 02:30:01.56
recommendation because I was taking this even before, you know, the podcast and stuff.

2143
02:30:01.56 --> 02:30:04.16
So I was into it nonetheless, Alphabrine.

2144
02:30:04.16 --> 02:30:05.16
That's a good one.

2145
02:30:05.16 --> 02:30:06.56
A bunch of other cool stuff.

2146
02:30:06.56 --> 02:30:11.04
If you're into protein powder, good clean protein powder on there, all this all work out

2147
02:30:11.04 --> 02:30:12.04
stuff too.

2148
02:30:12.04 --> 02:30:14.68
By the way, I got a bunch of kettlebells.

2149
02:30:14.68 --> 02:30:16.80
They're a primal bells, legend bell.

2150
02:30:16.80 --> 02:30:18.80
The artistic one, they're dope.

2151
02:30:18.80 --> 02:30:19.80
Look at my Instagram.

2152
02:30:19.80 --> 02:30:21.80
Do some on there.

2153
02:30:21.80 --> 02:30:22.80
Anyway.

2154
02:30:22.80 --> 02:30:29.76
That is a good way to support yourself, help yourself, maintain the workouts, physical

2155
02:30:29.76 --> 02:30:34.08
activity, all that stuff so you can be successful in that way.

2156
02:30:34.08 --> 02:30:35.80
I don't think there's any excuse anymore.

2157
02:30:35.80 --> 02:30:37.80
I don't have a real doubt.

2158
02:30:37.80 --> 02:30:39.80
Also, good way to support.

2159
02:30:39.80 --> 02:30:41.28
Really good way to support Amazon.

2160
02:30:41.28 --> 02:30:42.28
Click through.

2161
02:30:42.28 --> 02:30:52.68
When you go and get the book conversations with major dick winters, go to the website to

2162
02:30:52.68 --> 02:30:55.28
list it there and click through there.

2163
02:30:55.28 --> 02:30:56.28
Boom.

2164
02:30:56.28 --> 02:30:58.12
So basically, it's to Amazon, click through your bite through Amazon.

2165
02:30:58.12 --> 02:30:59.12
Amazon, click through.

2166
02:30:59.12 --> 02:31:02.12
You'd be free to do your shopping, click through the website, Amazon.

2167
02:31:02.12 --> 02:31:03.12
Boom.

2168
02:31:03.12 --> 02:31:05.32
Support the podcast.

2169
02:31:05.32 --> 02:31:07.36
Small action, big reaction.

2170
02:31:07.36 --> 02:31:10.56
Because the click through only takes what?

2171
02:31:10.56 --> 02:31:11.56
Three seconds.

2172
02:31:11.56 --> 02:31:12.56
I think we've been determined.

2173
02:31:12.56 --> 02:31:13.56
Maximum.

2174
02:31:13.56 --> 02:31:14.56
Really?

2175
02:31:14.56 --> 02:31:15.56
So, you know, Kim's some new way.

2176
02:31:15.56 --> 02:31:16.88
So, we'll save three seconds.

2177
02:31:16.88 --> 02:31:22.64
And then the reaction is massive support for this podcast.

2178
02:31:22.64 --> 02:31:23.64
That's a good way.

2179
02:31:23.64 --> 02:31:29.64
Amazon, click through the website, jocobadcast.com or I think it's on jocobadcast.com.

2180
02:31:29.64 --> 02:31:30.64
Click through.

2181
02:31:30.64 --> 02:31:33.64
Do your Amazon shopping.

2182
02:31:33.64 --> 02:31:36.28
Also, subscribe to the podcast on iTunes.

2183
02:31:36.28 --> 02:31:38.08
If you haven't already.

2184
02:31:38.08 --> 02:31:44.64
Stitcher, Google Play, all these other podcasting, providing platforms.

2185
02:31:44.64 --> 02:31:45.84
Also on YouTube.

2186
02:31:45.84 --> 02:31:50.20
If you don't mind the video version of this podcast, go to YouTube watch it there.

2187
02:31:50.20 --> 02:31:54.12
It's cool and adds that other layer of experience.

2188
02:31:54.12 --> 02:31:56.68
Yeah, everyone seems to do that when there's a guest.

2189
02:31:56.68 --> 02:31:57.68
Yeah.

2190
02:31:57.68 --> 02:31:58.68
Because they don't know who that person is.

2191
02:31:58.68 --> 02:31:59.68
They know what you look like.

2192
02:31:59.68 --> 02:32:00.68
They know what I look like.

2193
02:32:00.68 --> 02:32:01.68
Most people.

2194
02:32:01.68 --> 02:32:02.68
Most people.

2195
02:32:02.68 --> 02:32:05.56
Well, if they're listening to the podcast, eventually they know what you look like.

2196
02:32:05.56 --> 02:32:07.20
They know what I look like.

2197
02:32:07.20 --> 02:32:09.32
And so, there's no reason.

2198
02:32:09.32 --> 02:32:13.68
Sometimes, although, sometimes you can see, like when certain subjects come up and

2199
02:32:13.68 --> 02:32:17.84
there's maybe some intensity in the podcast more people watch it.

2200
02:32:17.84 --> 02:32:21.12
But if it's a pretty mellow podcast and we're just talking about whatever we're talking

2201
02:32:21.12 --> 02:32:25.44
about, maybe not everyone feels the need to go to the YouTube.

2202
02:32:25.44 --> 02:32:27.92
But when the guest comes on, people want to see what that person looks like.

2203
02:32:27.92 --> 02:32:30.52
And there's usually some more animated interactions.

2204
02:32:30.52 --> 02:32:31.52
Yeah, it's true.

2205
02:32:31.52 --> 02:32:32.52
Yeah, big time.

2206
02:32:32.52 --> 02:32:34.88
Yeah, I'm answering if you're into that.

2207
02:32:34.88 --> 02:32:35.88
You know what?

2208
02:32:35.88 --> 02:32:40.36
It'd be cool if you made a little clip of when Tim Kennedy was on.

2209
02:32:40.36 --> 02:32:42.36
And I read a question from the audience.

2210
02:32:42.36 --> 02:32:43.68
Was something along the lines.

2211
02:32:43.68 --> 02:32:47.80
And I said, you know, hey, you know, they

2212
02:32:47.80 --> 02:32:53.44
took away Bayonette training for boot camp and Tim Kennedy just goes, god damn it.

2213
02:32:53.44 --> 02:32:57.64
That's one of my favorite parts of any podcast ever.

2214
02:32:57.64 --> 02:33:01.48
In that, I wouldn't really appreciate it if you'd make that clip.

2215
02:33:01.48 --> 02:33:04.72
Even if it was like 12 seconds long, just the part.

2216
02:33:04.72 --> 02:33:06.32
Yeah, just 12 seconds long.

2217
02:33:06.32 --> 02:33:09.80
It would be worth having on there because everyone should know that that's a

2218
02:33:09.80 --> 02:33:14.000
travesty that they stop doing Bayonette courses in Army boot camp.

2219
02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.36
All right, you got it.

2220
02:33:15.36 --> 02:33:17.20
Some people, if they don't hear this, because that part thing,

2221
02:33:17.20 --> 02:33:19.92
he kind of confused, but hey, I think they'll appreciate it.

2222
02:33:19.92 --> 02:33:20.64
I think so.

2223
02:33:20.64 --> 02:33:21.64
Oh, they'll tell you it.

2224
02:33:21.64 --> 02:33:23.000
Yeah, they'll dig it fully.

2225
02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.72
But there's good animation.

2226
02:33:24.72 --> 02:33:25.72
Yeah.

2227
02:33:25.72 --> 02:33:27.000
He's getting crazy.

2228
02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:27.52
Yeah, Matt.

2229
02:33:27.52 --> 02:33:28.40
Which is fun.

2230
02:33:28.40 --> 02:33:32.000
And really in general, just a YouTube that's an added, like I said, in that added visual

2231
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
layer.

2232
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.52
If you're down for it, sometimes people, you know, you put it on your T, let's say in your

2233
02:33:36.52 --> 02:33:39.64
grud, you know, you're working out, where you're, you know, it's on the TV.

2234
02:33:39.64 --> 02:33:41.72
It's kind of like you're in the conversation a little bit more.

2235
02:33:41.72 --> 02:33:42.72
It feels like it.

2236
02:33:42.72 --> 02:33:46.32
And also, if people subscribe to the YouTube channel,

2237
02:33:46.32 --> 02:33:52.24
then when they can sign up where if you make an excerpt, right, then they can get that.

2238
02:33:52.24 --> 02:33:53.24
Because it's cool.

2239
02:33:53.24 --> 02:33:56.32
That's a good thing is as much easier as share an excerpt from the podcast than it

2240
02:33:56.32 --> 02:33:57.60
is to share an audio.

2241
02:33:57.60 --> 02:34:00.64
I don't even know how to share an audio piece of a podcast.

2242
02:34:00.64 --> 02:34:02.04
I don't know how to do that.

2243
02:34:02.04 --> 02:34:03.48
It probably can't be done.

2244
02:34:03.48 --> 02:34:05.04
Probably.

2245
02:34:05.04 --> 02:34:07.48
That's why we have the YouTube.

2246
02:34:07.48 --> 02:34:11.40
So yeah, go ahead, subscribe to that one and speak of an e-mentioned the excerpts.

2247
02:34:11.40 --> 02:34:12.88
Yeah, you put some excerpts.

2248
02:34:12.88 --> 02:34:16.24
You can't, if you don't want to share or you anticipate that this person is not going

2249
02:34:16.24 --> 02:34:20.48
to listen to two and a half hours of a podcast when you share it, you just get the little

2250
02:34:20.48 --> 02:34:22.48
lesson that you want to share.

2251
02:34:22.48 --> 02:34:24.88
But like, hey, how to approach college.

2252
02:34:24.88 --> 02:34:26.20
You know, they're more than everyone.

2253
02:34:26.20 --> 02:34:27.60
Yeah, that's a pop-in-o.

2254
02:34:27.60 --> 02:34:31.88
Because everybody that went to college already wishes they had that when they went to college.

2255
02:34:31.88 --> 02:34:34.88
Yeah, so when they, you know, when they encounter someone who's going to, you know, go

2256
02:34:34.88 --> 02:34:38.12
to college, they're kids or nephew, neighbor, whatever.

2257
02:34:38.12 --> 02:34:39.12
Boom.

2258
02:34:39.12 --> 02:34:41.48
They have some advice directly from Jocco.

2259
02:34:41.48 --> 02:34:43.48
Anyway, so yeah, you can share that.

2260
02:34:43.48 --> 02:34:44.48
Subscribe to the YouTube.

2261
02:34:44.48 --> 02:34:45.48
That's the point there.

2262
02:34:45.48 --> 02:34:49.60
And if you want, and if you want to support, and you know, if you want, you can sign up for

2263
02:34:49.60 --> 02:34:52.04
a little alert when I upload something on there.

2264
02:34:52.04 --> 02:34:53.04
I know.

2265
02:34:53.04 --> 02:34:54.04
Those alerts.

2266
02:34:54.04 --> 02:34:55.04
You can get out.

2267
02:34:55.04 --> 02:34:56.04
Pretty pretty stoked.

2268
02:34:56.04 --> 02:34:57.04
Do I see something coming through?

2269
02:34:57.04 --> 02:34:59.04
It's like a little present.

2270
02:34:59.04 --> 02:35:01.32
You know, yeah, some YouTube good one.

2271
02:35:01.32 --> 02:35:02.88
Also, Jocco is a store.

2272
02:35:02.88 --> 02:35:05.16
It's called JoccoStore.

2273
02:35:05.16 --> 02:35:06.16
JoccoStore.com.

2274
02:35:06.16 --> 02:35:10.84
You know, if you want t-shirts and whatnot, discipline equals freedom.

2275
02:35:10.84 --> 02:35:17.84
The one that simply says get after it on the front, that seemed to have gone over pretty

2276
02:35:17.84 --> 02:35:18.84
well, I'd say.

2277
02:35:18.84 --> 02:35:29.48
Well, and also it seems worth noting that we now offer the victory and the may.

2278
02:35:29.48 --> 02:35:30.48
Sure.

2279
02:35:30.48 --> 02:35:31.48
To the Jocco uniform.

2280
02:35:31.48 --> 02:35:32.48
That's where.

2281
02:35:32.48 --> 02:35:33.48
The time.

2282
02:35:33.48 --> 02:35:34.72
I wear it when I record the podcast.

2283
02:35:34.72 --> 02:35:35.72
I wear it all the time.

2284
02:35:35.72 --> 02:35:38.72
We, you know, obviously, because we have our gym.

2285
02:35:38.72 --> 02:35:39.72
Yeah.

2286
02:35:39.72 --> 02:35:40.72
We have a lot of t-shirts.

2287
02:35:40.72 --> 02:35:41.72
Our gym.

2288
02:35:41.72 --> 02:35:42.72
Our gym stay on it.

2289
02:35:42.72 --> 02:35:44.72
And so I wear that t-shirt a lot.

2290
02:35:44.72 --> 02:35:45.72
Yeah.

2291
02:35:45.72 --> 02:35:46.72
And I always have.

2292
02:35:46.72 --> 02:35:47.72
Yeah.

2293
02:35:47.72 --> 02:35:50.72
And then I didn't intentionally do it on the podcast in the beginning.

2294
02:35:50.72 --> 02:35:53.72
I just happened to be wearing it two or three times.

2295
02:35:53.72 --> 02:35:56.72
And then someone said, is that the only shirt, Jocco wears?

2296
02:35:56.72 --> 02:35:57.72
Yeah.

2297
02:35:57.72 --> 02:35:59.72
And at that point, I said, why yes it is.

2298
02:35:59.72 --> 02:36:01.72
No, Brad, you're like the guy on the fly.

2299
02:36:01.72 --> 02:36:03.72
Remember the movie The Fly?

2300
02:36:03.72 --> 02:36:04.72
Yeah.

2301
02:36:04.72 --> 02:36:05.72
And the lady's like, what was her?

2302
02:36:05.72 --> 02:36:06.72
I forget anything.

2303
02:36:06.72 --> 02:36:09.68
She's like, hey, is that your only set of clothes or something like that?

2304
02:36:09.68 --> 02:36:11.68
Once she sees in, is closet that they're all this thing?

2305
02:36:11.68 --> 02:36:12.68
Oh, yeah.

2306
02:36:12.68 --> 02:36:13.68
That is me.

2307
02:36:13.68 --> 02:36:14.68
Yeah.

2308
02:36:14.68 --> 02:36:15.68
Yeah.

2309
02:36:15.68 --> 02:36:16.68
Yeah.

2310
02:36:16.68 --> 02:36:16.68
I like to have things in the same.

2311
02:36:16.68 --> 02:36:19.68
But people would come and ask me, hey, where can I get the t-shirt?

2312
02:36:19.68 --> 02:36:22.68
So now we've been on the Jocco store.

2313
02:36:22.68 --> 02:36:24.68
Strangely, they didn't even have them at victory.

2314
02:36:24.68 --> 02:36:25.68
No, no.

2315
02:36:25.68 --> 02:36:26.68
People would come in and be like, yeah, we want to.

2316
02:36:26.68 --> 02:36:27.68
Yeah.

2317
02:36:27.68 --> 02:36:28.68
The original.

2318
02:36:28.68 --> 02:36:29.68
This is an original.

2319
02:36:29.68 --> 02:36:32.68
This is the original victory MMA t-shirt.

2320
02:36:32.68 --> 02:36:34.68
And we had to re-produce it.

2321
02:36:34.68 --> 02:36:35.68
Yeah.

2322
02:36:35.68 --> 02:36:36.68
So it's a re-issue.

2323
02:36:36.68 --> 02:36:37.68
Yeah.

2324
02:36:37.68 --> 02:36:38.68
And all.

2325
02:36:38.68 --> 02:36:39.68
But it's on respect, right?

2326
02:36:39.68 --> 02:36:40.68
Yeah, it is.

2327
02:36:40.68 --> 02:36:45.68
So I'm trying to think, like, is that, you know, it's not because it's the exact same design.

2328
02:36:45.68 --> 02:36:46.68
Yeah.

2329
02:36:46.68 --> 02:36:47.68
It's the exact same design.

2330
02:36:47.68 --> 02:36:48.68
Literally the exact same design.

2331
02:36:48.68 --> 02:36:48.68
Yeah.

2332
02:36:48.68 --> 02:36:50.68
The same file, right?

2333
02:36:50.68 --> 02:36:51.68
Yeah.

2334
02:36:51.68 --> 02:36:52.68
Boom.

2335
02:36:52.68 --> 02:36:53.68
So you get that one if you want it.

2336
02:36:53.68 --> 02:36:54.68
Yeah.

2337
02:36:54.68 --> 02:36:55.68
You can represent.

2338
02:36:55.68 --> 02:36:56.68
represent.

2339
02:36:56.68 --> 02:36:57.68
It's good.

2340
02:36:57.68 --> 02:36:59.68
It's interesting because yours are like old school.

2341
02:36:59.68 --> 02:37:00.68
So they kind of have like a fade to them.

2342
02:37:00.68 --> 02:37:01.68
Yeah.

2343
02:37:01.68 --> 02:37:02.68
You know, the new one.

2344
02:37:02.68 --> 02:37:03.68
Yeah.

2345
02:37:03.68 --> 02:37:04.68
The gleaming.

2346
02:37:04.68 --> 02:37:05.68
I'm gleaming.

2347
02:37:05.68 --> 02:37:06.68
I'm gleaming.

2348
02:37:06.68 --> 02:37:07.68
I'm going to grab a couple of those too, by the way.

2349
02:37:07.68 --> 02:37:08.68
All right.

2350
02:37:08.68 --> 02:37:12.68
Well, just because I was running low when I would hate to have other things in my, yeah.

2351
02:37:12.68 --> 02:37:14.68
What's that called when you have clothes?

2352
02:37:14.68 --> 02:37:15.68
I wore a girl.

2353
02:37:15.68 --> 02:37:16.68
Yeah.

2354
02:37:16.68 --> 02:37:17.68
Yes.

2355
02:37:17.68 --> 02:37:19.68
Good thinking, Joko.

2356
02:37:19.68 --> 02:37:21.68
Anyway, JokoStore.com.

2357
02:37:21.68 --> 02:37:22.68
Check those out.

2358
02:37:22.68 --> 02:37:25.68
Some other new stuff stuff things items on there.

2359
02:37:25.68 --> 02:37:27.68
Let me talk about this mug.

2360
02:37:27.68 --> 02:37:30.68
I'm not going to take too much time because we've been, you know, we've been going

2361
02:37:30.68 --> 02:37:31.68
to edit.

2362
02:37:31.68 --> 02:37:32.68
So this, this travel mug right here.

2363
02:37:32.68 --> 02:37:36.68
So you know how, you know, at home, you know, you have your cup.

2364
02:37:36.68 --> 02:37:37.68
Yeah.

2365
02:37:37.68 --> 02:37:38.68
You know what I'm talking about.

2366
02:37:38.68 --> 02:37:39.68
I'm talking about the one that I do.

2367
02:37:39.68 --> 02:37:40.68
You know what?

2368
02:37:40.68 --> 02:37:46.68
I have actually my wife once she searched for ever to get me a cup that I like.

2369
02:37:46.68 --> 02:37:47.68
Yeah.

2370
02:37:47.68 --> 02:37:48.68
She found it.

2371
02:37:48.68 --> 02:37:51.68
And then she went to Target and bought, you know, a dozen of them.

2372
02:37:51.68 --> 02:37:54.68
There's big giant plastic, but feel like glass, whatever that is.

2373
02:37:54.68 --> 02:37:55.68
I hope you'll really care something.

2374
02:37:55.68 --> 02:37:56.68
Yeah.

2375
02:37:56.68 --> 02:37:59.68
Can't break, but you can, but they feel good in your hand.

2376
02:37:59.68 --> 02:38:01.68
So I have a bunch of those, but apparently it's getting replaced.

2377
02:38:01.68 --> 02:38:02.68
Yes.

2378
02:38:02.68 --> 02:38:04.68
So it's strangely, I had the same thing.

2379
02:38:04.68 --> 02:38:05.68
Well, I was on the same search.

2380
02:38:05.68 --> 02:38:06.68
So I had this one.

2381
02:38:06.68 --> 02:38:10.68
What I arrived at my favorite cup was pink because they didn't have any other

2382
02:38:10.68 --> 02:38:11.68
colors.

2383
02:38:11.68 --> 02:38:13.68
It was pink, but it was big.

2384
02:38:13.68 --> 02:38:17.68
It was like maybe like 24 ounce, like big cup.

2385
02:38:17.68 --> 02:38:18.68
That's what it used for everything.

2386
02:38:18.68 --> 02:38:19.68
It was pink, whatever.

2387
02:38:19.68 --> 02:38:20.68
That meant nothing.

2388
02:38:20.68 --> 02:38:21.68
You're comfortable with your hand, huh?

2389
02:38:21.68 --> 02:38:22.68
Yeah, man.

2390
02:38:22.68 --> 02:38:25.68
Compared to the functionality, the pink was nothing.

2391
02:38:25.68 --> 02:38:26.68
But here's the thing.

2392
02:38:26.68 --> 02:38:28.68
It could barely fit in my cup holder.

2393
02:38:28.68 --> 02:38:31.68
You know, the kind of like you put it in, but it was like kind of stuck.

2394
02:38:31.68 --> 02:38:32.68
You'd have to fine.

2395
02:38:32.68 --> 02:38:34.68
But if that was the cup, that was the best one.

2396
02:38:34.68 --> 02:38:36.68
You used any other cup, you just don't know.

2397
02:38:36.68 --> 02:38:37.68
How you doing now?

2398
02:38:37.68 --> 02:38:39.68
I'm going to get to that.

2399
02:38:39.68 --> 02:38:40.68
So, but you know what I mean though.

2400
02:38:40.68 --> 02:38:41.68
So you know, exactly what I mean.

2401
02:38:41.68 --> 02:38:43.68
Where you, you know, you have your cup.

2402
02:38:43.68 --> 02:38:45.68
I don't know where's my, it could be dirty.

2403
02:38:45.68 --> 02:38:46.68
There could be cups everywhere.

2404
02:38:46.68 --> 02:38:47.68
All available.

2405
02:38:47.68 --> 02:38:48.68
You're like, no, I'm going to go and wash this.

2406
02:38:48.68 --> 02:38:50.68
You know, and I'm going to use my cup.

2407
02:38:50.68 --> 02:38:51.68
That's it.

2408
02:38:51.68 --> 02:38:52.68
This one.

2409
02:38:52.68 --> 02:38:53.68
Okay.

2410
02:38:53.68 --> 02:38:54.68
We'll talk about this mug.

2411
02:38:54.68 --> 02:38:56.68
It's technically what a travel tumbler, right?

2412
02:38:56.68 --> 02:38:57.68
Been heard of whatever.

2413
02:38:57.68 --> 02:38:59.68
You know, comes with a top on it's stuff.

2414
02:38:59.68 --> 02:39:01.68
But you take all the top boom.

2415
02:39:01.68 --> 02:39:05.68
You take it to ergonautonomically conducive to just using it as a cup.

2416
02:39:05.68 --> 02:39:09.68
You know how if you have like threads in there to screw on a top.

2417
02:39:09.68 --> 02:39:12.68
It's like, yeah, it's like a thing.

2418
02:39:12.68 --> 02:39:15.68
Anyway, and that's not to mention the look.

2419
02:39:15.68 --> 02:39:16.68
Black on black.

2420
02:39:16.68 --> 02:39:17.68
What they call it, murdered out.

2421
02:39:17.68 --> 02:39:19.68
You heard that expression murdered out.

2422
02:39:19.68 --> 02:39:20.68
No.

2423
02:39:20.68 --> 02:39:21.68
Trigger.

2424
02:39:21.68 --> 02:39:22.68
Well, if you have time Google murdered out.

2425
02:39:22.68 --> 02:39:23.68
Cadillac.

2426
02:39:23.68 --> 02:39:24.68
Guitar.

2427
02:39:24.68 --> 02:39:25.68
It's a flat mat.

2428
02:39:25.68 --> 02:39:26.68
Okay.

2429
02:39:26.68 --> 02:39:28.68
Painting with black wheels.

2430
02:39:28.68 --> 02:39:29.68
So it's basically all black.

2431
02:39:29.68 --> 02:39:31.68
Tantolin is all black.

2432
02:39:31.68 --> 02:39:33.68
So that's this thing is murdered out technically.

2433
02:39:33.68 --> 02:39:39.68
Flat black mat with like the logo, the 434 and the dysplonical

2434
02:39:39.68 --> 02:39:41.68
stream is like shiny black.

2435
02:39:41.68 --> 02:39:43.68
Very nice.

2436
02:39:43.68 --> 02:39:44.68
Very nice.

2437
02:39:44.68 --> 02:39:46.68
So, and that's just the design.

2438
02:39:46.68 --> 02:39:48.68
So function wise.

2439
02:39:48.68 --> 02:39:50.68
Perfect 30 ounces.

2440
02:39:50.68 --> 02:39:53.68
Not 2430 straight up.

2441
02:39:53.68 --> 02:39:54.68
And it.

2442
02:39:54.68 --> 02:39:55.68
What is it?

2443
02:39:55.68 --> 02:39:56.68
BPA free.

2444
02:39:56.68 --> 02:39:57.68
All that.

2445
02:39:57.68 --> 02:39:58.68
So you don't get poisoned.

2446
02:39:58.68 --> 02:39:59.68
So that's a big thing.

2447
02:39:59.68 --> 02:40:00.68
And also okay.

2448
02:40:00.68 --> 02:40:02.68
And here's the impressive part.

2449
02:40:02.68 --> 02:40:04.68
When I ultimately was like dang.

2450
02:40:04.68 --> 02:40:05.68
Impressed.

2451
02:40:05.68 --> 02:40:08.68
I guess this is like a technology is kind of been around, but I didn't know because

2452
02:40:08.68 --> 02:40:11.68
I had that plastic cup, you know, whatever.

2453
02:40:11.68 --> 02:40:12.68
This it'll keep.

2454
02:40:12.68 --> 02:40:15.68
It'll separate the temperatures from inside and outside.

2455
02:40:15.68 --> 02:40:21.68
So the inside temperature won't leak to the outside, meaning it keeps like if you have ice and cold stuff in here bro.

2456
02:40:21.68 --> 02:40:22.68
Means it's insulated.

2457
02:40:22.68 --> 02:40:23.68
It'll.

2458
02:40:23.68 --> 02:40:24.68
Yeah.

2459
02:40:24.68 --> 02:40:27.68
But it's insulated in a special crazy way.

2460
02:40:27.68 --> 02:40:30.68
And this is with no top on by the way.

2461
02:40:30.68 --> 02:40:32.68
You fill it up with ice your ice water.

2462
02:40:32.68 --> 02:40:33.68
You know, it's what I did one time.

2463
02:40:33.68 --> 02:40:36.68
I did finish like it was maybe three quarters of it still some water in there.

2464
02:40:36.68 --> 02:40:39.68
And I just I kind of left it went to bed.

2465
02:40:39.68 --> 02:40:41.68
The next day.

2466
02:40:41.68 --> 02:40:43.68
I looked at it.

2467
02:40:43.68 --> 02:40:46.68
And the ice was still in there.

2468
02:40:46.68 --> 02:40:47.68
And yeah, sure.

2469
02:40:47.68 --> 02:40:51.68
That doesn't mean that much, but as far as proving how it keeps the temperature.

2470
02:40:51.68 --> 02:40:57.68
That's a lot straight up. Also, it doesn't like sweat, you know, when you have a cold drink on it on it.

2471
02:40:57.68 --> 02:41:00.68
Yeah, if it's on your desk, there's a working desk or some stuff up.

2472
02:41:00.68 --> 02:41:02.68
Hot day, whatever you made.

2473
02:41:02.68 --> 02:41:04.68
It's like, yeah, it doesn't even do that.

2474
02:41:04.68 --> 02:41:06.68
Doesn't do that at all.

2475
02:41:06.68 --> 02:41:07.68
One time.

2476
02:41:07.68 --> 02:41:08.68
What was outside?

2477
02:41:08.68 --> 02:41:09.68
The pool.

2478
02:41:09.68 --> 02:41:10.68
Whatever.

2479
02:41:10.68 --> 02:41:11.68
Cruising.

2480
02:41:11.68 --> 02:41:12.68
I used to water.

2481
02:41:12.68 --> 02:41:12.68
Actually it was chocolate.

2482
02:41:12.68 --> 02:41:12.68
T.

2483
02:41:12.68 --> 02:41:13.68
Boom.

2484
02:41:13.68 --> 02:41:13.68
Oh.

2485
02:41:13.68 --> 02:41:15.68
We'll get to that too.

2486
02:41:15.68 --> 02:41:16.68
But.

2487
02:41:16.68 --> 02:41:20.68
So, you know, I leave it there and it's in the sun and I grab it and I'm like, oh my.

2488
02:41:20.68 --> 02:41:23.68
This, this is going to be totally melted because I'm feeling it.

2489
02:41:23.68 --> 02:41:26.68
The, the cup physically feeling the outside of the cup.

2490
02:41:26.68 --> 02:41:28.68
And it's straight up hot.

2491
02:41:28.68 --> 02:41:30.68
The sun is beaming on its hot.

2492
02:41:30.68 --> 02:41:35.68
If I look inside ice, still the full on ice, not even melted at all.

2493
02:41:35.68 --> 02:41:38.68
Well, I'm telling you when you replace your cup.

2494
02:41:38.68 --> 02:41:39.68
Be that you're happy.

2495
02:41:39.68 --> 02:41:41.68
I'm telling you right now.

2496
02:41:41.68 --> 02:41:45.68
When you replace this cup, you're going to find all these benefits to it above and beyond just the

2497
02:41:45.68 --> 02:41:50.68
the, the dope and size and it fits in your cup holder straight up.

2498
02:41:50.68 --> 02:41:52.68
See how it's like the shape.

2499
02:41:52.68 --> 02:41:53.68
Yeah.

2500
02:41:53.68 --> 02:41:54.68
Cool.

2501
02:41:54.68 --> 02:41:55.68
All right.

2502
02:41:55.68 --> 02:41:56.68
Next thing.

2503
02:41:56.68 --> 02:41:57.68
I feel like we could talk about this really.

2504
02:41:57.68 --> 02:41:58.68
We don't want to.

2505
02:41:58.68 --> 02:41:59.68
I'm just sitting well.

2506
02:41:59.68 --> 02:42:00.68
I know you like it.

2507
02:42:00.68 --> 02:42:01.68
I'm glad you like it.

2508
02:42:01.68 --> 02:42:02.68
I like it too.

2509
02:42:02.68 --> 02:42:03.68
Next time you're utilizing it actually.

2510
02:42:03.68 --> 02:42:05.68
And I, I'm pressed.

2511
02:42:05.68 --> 02:42:06.68
My teeth.

2512
02:42:06.68 --> 02:42:07.68
I see a still icy.

2513
02:42:07.68 --> 02:42:10.68
I mean, getting down with this cup mug for a long time.

2514
02:42:10.68 --> 02:42:12.68
And thoroughly impressed.

2515
02:42:12.68 --> 02:42:13.68
Anyway.

2516
02:42:13.68 --> 02:42:15.68
So yeah, we got some, we got that on the Jockel Store.

2517
02:42:15.68 --> 02:42:16.68
Jockel Store.com.

2518
02:42:16.68 --> 02:42:17.68
We got it on there.

2519
02:42:17.68 --> 02:42:18.68
Also.

2520
02:42:18.68 --> 02:42:23.68
Should we talk about the Warrior Kid shirts?

2521
02:42:23.68 --> 02:42:25.68
You can talk about that.

2522
02:42:25.68 --> 02:42:26.68
All right.

2523
02:42:26.68 --> 02:42:27.68
There are on there too.

2524
02:42:27.68 --> 02:42:28.68
Warrior Kid shirts.

2525
02:42:28.68 --> 02:42:30.68
Youth sizes for your kids.

2526
02:42:30.68 --> 02:42:31.68
Boom.

2527
02:42:31.68 --> 02:42:32.68
There it is.

2528
02:42:32.68 --> 02:42:33.68
Very cool.

2529
02:42:33.68 --> 02:42:35.68
Warrior kids out there.

2530
02:42:35.68 --> 02:42:38.68
There's some layers in that one too that I just found out.

2531
02:42:38.68 --> 02:42:41.68
By the way, your country, the colors and what.

2532
02:42:41.68 --> 02:42:43.68
Yes.

2533
02:42:43.68 --> 02:42:44.68
Don't worry about that.

2534
02:42:44.68 --> 02:42:45.68
Good trick.

2535
02:42:45.68 --> 02:42:46.68
Again, Jockel Store.com.

2536
02:42:46.68 --> 02:42:47.68
This is the Rashgard's on there.

2537
02:42:47.68 --> 02:42:49.68
New Rashgard's out.

2538
02:42:49.68 --> 02:42:51.68
Maybe they're out.

2539
02:42:51.68 --> 02:42:54.68
Putties kind of getting into like a spring.

2540
02:42:54.68 --> 02:42:56.68
I mean, maybe summer pretty soon.

2541
02:42:56.68 --> 02:42:59.68
So what he might not be is applicable either way.

2542
02:42:59.68 --> 02:43:03.68
We need to start prepping the winter hoodies that I'm going to be more in charge of this time.

2543
02:43:03.68 --> 02:43:05.68
To let their heavier and more powerful.

2544
02:43:05.68 --> 02:43:08.68
Yeah, because you're thinking New England winter.

2545
02:43:08.68 --> 02:43:09.68
Yeah, I'm thinking of a collier.

2546
02:43:09.68 --> 02:43:13.68
I also think there's Chicago and Minnesota and Iowa.

2547
02:43:13.68 --> 02:43:14.68
Yeah.

2548
02:43:14.68 --> 02:43:15.68
I'm not thinking of coi over here.

2549
02:43:15.68 --> 02:43:17.68
If I was in coi, I would even wear shirt.

2550
02:43:17.68 --> 02:43:18.68
Much less sweatshirt.

2551
02:43:18.68 --> 02:43:20.68
Brad, that was my whole point.

2552
02:43:20.68 --> 02:43:21.68
You're like, hoodies.

2553
02:43:21.68 --> 02:43:22.68
That's probably what is that.

2554
02:43:22.68 --> 02:43:23.68
Yeah, you know what it was.

2555
02:43:23.68 --> 02:43:25.68
Actually, my wife knows what these are.

2556
02:43:25.68 --> 02:43:27.68
So I just consulted with her nonetheless.

2557
02:43:27.68 --> 02:43:28.68
Jockel Store.com.

2558
02:43:28.68 --> 02:43:29.68
That's some cool stuff on there.

2559
02:43:29.68 --> 02:43:32.68
Travel monks on shirts, cool shirts, support that way.

2560
02:43:32.68 --> 02:43:36.68
And you know, you get a little item represent in the wild.

2561
02:43:36.68 --> 02:43:37.68
Boom.

2562
02:43:37.68 --> 02:43:42.68
Also, support yourself with this one psychological warfare.

2563
02:43:42.68 --> 02:43:47.68
If you don't know what that is, which I know you already do, but if you don't, it's an album with tracks.

2564
02:43:47.68 --> 02:43:48.68
No music.

2565
02:43:48.68 --> 02:43:49.68
It's Jockel on there.

2566
02:43:49.68 --> 02:43:50.68
And these tracks are useful.

2567
02:43:50.68 --> 02:43:51.68
These are utility.

2568
02:43:51.68 --> 02:43:58.68
What do you call functional tactical tracks to help you stay on the path?

2569
02:43:58.68 --> 02:44:00.68
You know, we talked about getting distracted.

2570
02:44:00.68 --> 02:44:02.68
Some people get distracted by comfort.

2571
02:44:02.68 --> 02:44:04.68
You know, like the path.

2572
02:44:04.68 --> 02:44:05.68
The path isn't comfortable.

2573
02:44:05.68 --> 02:44:06.68
The path isn't comfortable.

2574
02:44:06.68 --> 02:44:08.68
It's riddled with discomfort.

2575
02:44:08.68 --> 02:44:09.68
Riddled.

2576
02:44:09.68 --> 02:44:13.68
And sometimes after a while, that discomfort can get to certain people at certain times.

2577
02:44:13.68 --> 02:44:19.68
So what this psychological warfare album does is it keeps you on the path.

2578
02:44:19.68 --> 02:44:24.68
So, for example, you want to wake up every day, early.

2579
02:44:24.68 --> 02:44:33.68
And then that one day, you're distracted by the comfort of hitting the snooze button, getting 10 more, 20 more minutes of sleep.

2580
02:44:33.68 --> 02:44:35.68
That's bad.

2581
02:44:35.68 --> 02:44:36.68
That's a distraction.

2582
02:44:36.68 --> 02:44:38.68
That's a deviation from the path.

2583
02:44:38.68 --> 02:44:41.68
Listen to psychological warfare.

2584
02:44:41.68 --> 02:44:42.68
What's the number?

2585
02:44:42.68 --> 02:44:43.68
Number one, I think.

2586
02:44:43.68 --> 02:44:45.68
Get up and get out and get a listen to that.

2587
02:44:45.68 --> 02:44:46.68
Put it as your alarm.

2588
02:44:46.68 --> 02:44:48.68
I dare you to hit snooze.

2589
02:44:48.68 --> 02:44:49.68
Dare you.

2590
02:44:49.68 --> 02:44:51.68
Jockel, just tell you.

2591
02:44:51.68 --> 02:44:54.68
Practically, you know, practical, pragmatic way.

2592
02:44:54.68 --> 02:44:56.68
Why you should not hit the snooze.

2593
02:44:56.68 --> 02:44:57.68
Boom.

2594
02:44:57.68 --> 02:45:02.68
I would say with 100% certainty that you will not hit the snooze.

2595
02:45:02.68 --> 02:45:05.68
You will stay on the path and that goes for all these other things,

2596
02:45:05.68 --> 02:45:08.68
deviating from diet, deviating from pushing yourself,

2597
02:45:08.68 --> 02:45:12.68
you know, workout deviating from going to the gym in the first place.

2598
02:45:12.68 --> 02:45:13.68
Going exactly right.

2599
02:45:13.68 --> 02:45:16.68
Or if you have like with this procrastination situation,

2600
02:45:16.68 --> 02:45:20.68
oh man, that's the main one that, you know, like,

2601
02:45:20.68 --> 02:45:22.68
how you're always like, hey, I need to do this.

2602
02:45:22.68 --> 02:45:23.68
I should do this.

2603
02:45:23.68 --> 02:45:24.68
Just doing it.

2604
02:45:24.68 --> 02:45:25.68
Yeah.

2605
02:45:25.68 --> 02:45:29.68
procrastination is pretty much the thing that's going to keep you from doing it.

2606
02:45:29.68 --> 02:45:30.68
Nonetheless, if you procrastinate, this,

2607
02:45:30.68 --> 02:45:32.68
hey, got a little solution for you too.

2608
02:45:32.68 --> 02:45:33.68
You know what?

2609
02:45:33.68 --> 02:45:35.68
Psychological warfare.

2610
02:45:35.68 --> 02:45:36.68
Jockel willing.

2611
02:45:36.68 --> 02:45:39.68
Look for it on iTunes or Amazon Music by the way.

2612
02:45:39.68 --> 02:45:40.68
It's a good one.

2613
02:45:40.68 --> 02:45:41.68
That's pretty cool.

2614
02:45:41.68 --> 02:45:43.68
Also, while you're on Amazon,

2615
02:45:43.68 --> 02:45:46.68
you can get this book that we just covered today.

2616
02:45:46.68 --> 02:45:48.68
Conversations with major dickwinters.

2617
02:45:48.68 --> 02:45:54.68
Jockel White T is also available on Amazon.

2618
02:45:54.68 --> 02:45:59.68
If you don't want to drink a sodas,

2619
02:45:59.68 --> 02:46:03.68
you know, which no one should be drinking sodas at all.

2620
02:46:03.68 --> 02:46:05.68
You don't need them.

2621
02:46:05.68 --> 02:46:07.68
They're, they're actually horrible for you.

2622
02:46:07.68 --> 02:46:10.68
But remember when we were eating sushi in New York and busted out the coke?

2623
02:46:10.68 --> 02:46:14.68
Yeah, I was, I was going to actually just, I was surprised.

2624
02:46:14.68 --> 02:46:17.68
I thought that you weren't going to be my friend any more than that.

2625
02:46:17.68 --> 02:46:19.68
You know, like, you really like, I couldn't believe it.

2626
02:46:19.68 --> 02:46:22.68
So anyway, as echo has this tradition,

2627
02:46:22.68 --> 02:46:25.68
which to me sounds like a sugar coated lie,

2628
02:46:25.68 --> 02:46:28.68
that when he eats sushi has a glass bottle of coke.

2629
02:46:28.68 --> 02:46:29.68
So he takes that.

2630
02:46:29.68 --> 02:46:33.68
I overcame my hatred for him the best I could.

2631
02:46:33.68 --> 02:46:35.68
It's kind of like when I was talking today about like,

2632
02:46:35.68 --> 02:46:37.68
Hey, if you're a vet, you can't look at everyone like,

2633
02:46:37.68 --> 02:46:41.68
Hey, this person's just, I had to be, I had to be like,

2634
02:46:41.68 --> 02:46:43.68
okay, echo's not a bad person.

2635
02:46:43.68 --> 02:46:45.68
It's just mentally weak right now.

2636
02:46:45.68 --> 02:46:47.68
And we'll just deal with it.

2637
02:46:47.68 --> 02:46:49.68
Don't drink that drink, Jockel White T,

2638
02:46:49.68 --> 02:46:52.68
which actually tastes better than coke.

2639
02:46:52.68 --> 02:46:54.68
There's no doubt that it tastes better than coke.

2640
02:46:54.68 --> 02:46:56.68
That's subjective, but sure.

2641
02:46:56.68 --> 02:46:58.68
Are these serious right now?

2642
02:46:58.68 --> 02:47:00.68
I'm saying better is a subject.

2643
02:47:00.68 --> 02:47:02.68
Yeah, then everyone agrees within the world.

2644
02:47:02.68 --> 02:47:05.68
Put side by side, taste test.

2645
02:47:05.68 --> 02:47:06.68
There you go.

2646
02:47:06.68 --> 02:47:07.68
We'll go boom.

2647
02:47:07.68 --> 02:47:08.68
Garenty, everybody.

2648
02:47:08.68 --> 02:47:11.68
So it's give me that, give me the Jockel White T.

2649
02:47:11.68 --> 02:47:12.68
They don't want that.

2650
02:47:12.68 --> 02:47:14.68
It's syrup, sugar.

2651
02:47:14.68 --> 02:47:17.68
I think you might be 147% correct.

2652
02:47:17.68 --> 02:47:18.68
I don't know.

2653
02:47:18.68 --> 02:47:19.68
Absolutely.

2654
02:47:19.68 --> 02:47:21.68
We'll do a taste test on the you can taste the coke.

2655
02:47:21.68 --> 02:47:24.68
I'm not touching my lips to that stuff.

2656
02:47:24.68 --> 02:47:25.68
Nasty.

2657
02:47:25.68 --> 02:47:26.68
You're the man.

2658
02:47:26.68 --> 02:47:29.68
One time they had a, we have a PT situation.

2659
02:47:29.68 --> 02:47:31.68
We call them Monster Mash.

2660
02:47:31.68 --> 02:47:33.68
And it's you just do a bunch of crazy events.

2661
02:47:33.68 --> 02:47:35.68
Pull ups and rope climbs and carry boats around and swim.

2662
02:47:35.68 --> 02:47:37.68
And we're doing that when I was the,

2663
02:47:37.68 --> 02:47:40.68
the officer in charge of trade it.

2664
02:47:40.68 --> 02:47:42.68
And so yeah, oh, I see a trade it.

2665
02:47:42.68 --> 02:47:44.68
So I brought my son with me.

2666
02:47:44.68 --> 02:47:46.68
And they did this Monster Mash.

2667
02:47:46.68 --> 02:47:49.68
And one of the things you had to do in the Monster Mash.

2668
02:47:49.68 --> 02:47:51.68
And this thing's being timed and serration on that stuff.

2669
02:47:51.68 --> 02:47:55.68
You had to drink a full Coca Cola through a straw.

2670
02:47:55.68 --> 02:47:57.68
So my son's doing the Monster Mash.

2671
02:47:57.68 --> 02:47:59.68
And he's probably seven or something like that.

2672
02:47:59.68 --> 02:48:02.68
And he'd never even had a coke before.

2673
02:48:02.68 --> 02:48:03.68
It burned his mouth, probably.

2674
02:48:03.68 --> 02:48:04.68
Yeah.

2675
02:48:04.68 --> 02:48:05.68
And he just hated it.

2676
02:48:05.68 --> 02:48:07.68
You're so nasty to him.

2677
02:48:07.68 --> 02:48:08.68
Yeah.

2678
02:48:08.68 --> 02:48:09.68
That's how I looked at you.

2679
02:48:09.68 --> 02:48:11.68
That was like, dude.

2680
02:48:11.68 --> 02:48:12.68
You're making this sick.

2681
02:48:12.68 --> 02:48:14.68
So Jockel White T, you know,

2682
02:48:14.68 --> 02:48:16.68
go on there, read the reviews as well.

2683
02:48:16.68 --> 02:48:18.68
You know, you'll see things like this.

2684
02:48:18.68 --> 02:48:20.68
And when I need to crush and power through,

2685
02:48:20.68 --> 02:48:22.68
will the work, I drew me some Jockel White T.

2686
02:48:22.68 --> 02:48:26.68
If I need a little extra kick to crush it,

2687
02:48:26.68 --> 02:48:27.68
that's what I do.

2688
02:48:27.68 --> 02:48:30.68
I've begun working fewer hours at the office.

2689
02:48:30.68 --> 02:48:34.68
As my productivity has risen 900%.

2690
02:48:34.68 --> 02:48:36.68
That's pretty legit.

2691
02:48:36.68 --> 02:48:37.68
Excellent numbers.

2692
02:48:37.68 --> 02:48:38.68
Yeah.

2693
02:48:38.68 --> 02:48:38.68
Yeah.

2694
02:48:38.68 --> 02:48:42.68
And obviously that's a 100% accurate because it came from an Amazon review.

2695
02:48:42.68 --> 02:48:43.68
So.

2696
02:48:43.68 --> 02:48:45.68
And actually,

2697
02:48:45.68 --> 02:48:48.68
there's a warning as well.

2698
02:48:48.68 --> 02:48:49.68
Caution regarding this product,

2699
02:48:49.68 --> 02:48:53.68
leaving your supply of Jockel White T out in the open will require overwatch.

2700
02:48:53.68 --> 02:48:59.68
I now have non T drinkers hitting my reserves almost as badly as dedicated to T drinkers.

2701
02:48:59.68 --> 02:49:02.68
No double blind study required, right?

2702
02:49:02.68 --> 02:49:03.68
That's this is the thing.

2703
02:49:03.68 --> 02:49:06.68
It doesn't taste like T, right?

2704
02:49:06.68 --> 02:49:08.68
It doesn't taste like T in my opinion.

2705
02:49:08.68 --> 02:49:09.68
It tastes like.

2706
02:49:09.68 --> 02:49:11.68
It tastes like victory.

2707
02:49:11.68 --> 02:49:13.68
But it doesn't taste like that.

2708
02:49:13.68 --> 02:49:15.68
So that's that.

2709
02:49:15.68 --> 02:49:16.68
Jockel White T.

2710
02:49:16.68 --> 02:49:17.68
You can get it on Amazon.com.

2711
02:49:17.68 --> 02:49:18.68
Way the warrior kid.

2712
02:49:18.68 --> 02:49:21.68
The book is out as you know.

2713
02:49:21.68 --> 02:49:23.68
Thank you for getting it.

2714
02:49:23.68 --> 02:49:24.68
Kids have been crushing it.

2715
02:49:24.68 --> 02:49:25.68
It's awesome.

2716
02:49:25.68 --> 02:49:29.68
That's one of my favorite things that has happened to me in the past.

2717
02:49:29.68 --> 02:49:35.68
Several years is people started posting pictures of their kids reading.

2718
02:49:35.68 --> 02:49:37.68
Way the warrior kid.

2719
02:49:37.68 --> 02:49:38.68
Yeah.

2720
02:49:38.68 --> 02:49:42.68
And that was awesome for me to see.

2721
02:49:42.68 --> 02:49:43.68
I know.

2722
02:49:43.68 --> 02:49:44.68
I know.

2723
02:49:44.68 --> 02:49:46.68
Those kids are reading that book.

2724
02:49:46.68 --> 02:49:49.68
And they're thinking that they're going to get a little bit better.

2725
02:49:49.68 --> 02:49:52.68
A little bit stronger, a little bit faster, a little bit smarter.

2726
02:49:52.68 --> 02:49:53.68
And they're going to see.

2727
02:49:53.68 --> 02:49:56.68
And people are sending me pictures of kids doing pushups and kids doing.

2728
02:49:56.68 --> 02:50:00.68
A guy sent me a video of his kid.

2729
02:50:00.68 --> 02:50:05.68
You know how you have little night vision in your kids room to you can monitor them.

2730
02:50:05.68 --> 02:50:06.68
Oh, like on a little monitor.

2731
02:50:06.68 --> 02:50:07.68
Yeah.

2732
02:50:07.68 --> 02:50:08.68
A little monitor.

2733
02:50:08.68 --> 02:50:09.68
Yeah.

2734
02:50:09.68 --> 02:50:12.68
He sent me a picture of video of the monitor.

2735
02:50:12.68 --> 02:50:15.68
The kids in the room after night time after bedtime.

2736
02:50:15.68 --> 02:50:16.68
Guess what the kids doing.

2737
02:50:16.68 --> 02:50:17.68
Pushups.

2738
02:50:17.68 --> 02:50:19.68
He's doing pushups.

2739
02:50:19.68 --> 02:50:20.68
Why?

2740
02:50:20.68 --> 02:50:21.68
You want to get stronger.

2741
02:50:21.68 --> 02:50:22.68
Want to get better.

2742
02:50:22.68 --> 02:50:23.68
So yeah.

2743
02:50:23.68 --> 02:50:25.68
Get that if you got kids, get it from them.

2744
02:50:25.68 --> 02:50:26.68
If you're an adult, that's cool.

2745
02:50:26.68 --> 02:50:27.68
Get it anyways.

2746
02:50:27.68 --> 02:50:28.68
I'll do it.

2747
02:50:28.68 --> 02:50:31.68
I'll have a lot to learn from Uncle Jake myself included.

2748
02:50:31.68 --> 02:50:36.68
So run out, go to your local bookstore.

2749
02:50:36.68 --> 02:50:40.68
And grab copies if they don't have it in your local bookstore.

2750
02:50:40.68 --> 02:50:42.68
Tell them to get it.

2751
02:50:42.68 --> 02:50:46.68
So that other kids can see it and get it.

2752
02:50:46.68 --> 02:50:47.68
Let's make people better.

2753
02:50:47.68 --> 02:50:50.68
Also you can preorder Displunicles Freedom Field Manual.

2754
02:50:50.68 --> 02:50:53.68
Again, you can find it in the get after it.

2755
02:50:53.68 --> 02:50:56.68
Section of any bookstore or online bookseller.

2756
02:50:56.68 --> 02:50:58.68
It is the only book in that section.

2757
02:50:58.68 --> 02:51:01.68
If your bookstore doesn't have that section.

2758
02:51:01.68 --> 02:51:04.68
Which it probably won't tell them to get after it.

2759
02:51:04.68 --> 02:51:06.68
And make one.

2760
02:51:06.68 --> 02:51:11.68
And then put Displunicles Freedom there and get a copy of it for yourself.

2761
02:51:11.68 --> 02:51:13.68
Extreme ownership.

2762
02:51:13.68 --> 02:51:16.68
Yes, the fundamental principles of combat leadership.

2763
02:51:16.68 --> 02:51:23.68
They will help you win in any capacity on the battlefield on the beat in business in life.

2764
02:51:23.68 --> 02:51:28.68
Extreme ownership written by myself and my brother, Lave Babin.

2765
02:51:28.68 --> 02:51:30.68
You can get that book as well.

2766
02:51:30.68 --> 02:51:34.68
If you need more than the podcast and the book, that's fine.

2767
02:51:34.68 --> 02:51:35.68
It's okay.

2768
02:51:35.68 --> 02:51:38.68
Contact our leadership and management consulting company,

2769
02:51:38.68 --> 02:51:42.68
echelon front info at echelon front dot com.

2770
02:51:42.68 --> 02:51:44.68
Now the master.

2771
02:51:44.68 --> 02:51:45.68
The master.

2772
02:51:45.68 --> 02:51:49.68
We just got done with master 002 in New York City.

2773
02:51:49.68 --> 02:51:50.68
What's your assessment?

2774
02:51:50.68 --> 02:51:51.68
Echo Trust.

2775
02:51:51.68 --> 02:51:55.68
My assessment was that it it was an upgraded.

2776
02:51:55.68 --> 02:51:56.68
It is.

2777
02:51:56.68 --> 02:51:58.68
It wasn't upgrade from the first one.

2778
02:51:58.68 --> 02:52:01.68
And that's in a lot because that first one was that I was like,

2779
02:52:01.68 --> 02:52:05.68
Dang, that was really impactful to the kind of where and I don't really say like,

2780
02:52:05.68 --> 02:52:06.68
This event was impactful.

2781
02:52:06.68 --> 02:52:07.68
I don't use that word.

2782
02:52:07.68 --> 02:52:09.68
Not because I'm above it or nothing like that.

2783
02:52:09.68 --> 02:52:11.68
But I'm just saying to say it, it got to be true.

2784
02:52:11.68 --> 02:52:16.68
So that first one was that was like, dang, this is really good.

2785
02:52:16.68 --> 02:52:19.68
From top to bottom, like even the material,

2786
02:52:19.68 --> 02:52:23.68
boom, it's like all usable material, all of it.

2787
02:52:23.68 --> 02:52:26.68
And then like I always say and I think people overlooked this part.

2788
02:52:26.68 --> 02:52:28.68
A lot of time like just the social element.

2789
02:52:28.68 --> 02:52:33.68
It's so easy to make friends with everyone because they all kind of have the same kind of interesting goals.

2790
02:52:33.68 --> 02:52:35.68
And one way or another there's going to be some overlap there.

2791
02:52:35.68 --> 02:52:37.68
And then you just to part was fun too.

2792
02:52:37.68 --> 02:52:40.68
You know, it's like, it's just this great event, you know.

2793
02:52:40.68 --> 02:52:42.68
And then the second one and I wasn't.

2794
02:52:42.68 --> 02:52:43.68
I'm beyond us with you.

2795
02:52:43.68 --> 02:52:46.68
I wasn't as fired up because it was in New York.

2796
02:52:46.68 --> 02:52:49.68
It's like outside of the comfort zone.

2797
02:52:49.68 --> 02:52:50.68
The first one here, San Diego.

2798
02:52:50.68 --> 02:52:51.68
I was like, well, sweet, proud of this like,

2799
02:52:51.68 --> 02:52:53.68
You was even better.

2800
02:52:53.68 --> 02:52:55.68
That's that this past one was better.

2801
02:52:55.68 --> 02:52:57.68
Yeah, it was got getting great feedback.

2802
02:52:57.68 --> 02:52:58.68
Awesome.

2803
02:52:58.68 --> 02:53:03.68
And like you said, I think the important, well, one of the most important things that you just said is it's very pragmatic.

2804
02:53:03.68 --> 02:53:04.68
Yeah.

2805
02:53:04.68 --> 02:53:07.68
It's not like it's not like, hey, you're going to learn some stuff,

2806
02:53:07.68 --> 02:53:09.68
but it's not going to be really applicable.

2807
02:53:09.68 --> 02:53:10.68
No, no, no.

2808
02:53:10.68 --> 02:53:11.68
It's going to be applicable.

2809
02:53:11.68 --> 02:53:12.68
Yeah.

2810
02:53:12.68 --> 02:53:15.68
You walk out when you finish that section and we get done talking about it.

2811
02:53:15.68 --> 02:53:16.68
Boom.

2812
02:53:16.68 --> 02:53:18.68
You can, you can implement that immediately.

2813
02:53:18.68 --> 02:53:19.68
Yeah, it's interesting.

2814
02:53:19.68 --> 02:53:22.68
You guys have like a lot of military stories and examples, you know.

2815
02:53:22.68 --> 02:53:24.68
And then, but when you go to the Q&A,

2816
02:53:24.68 --> 02:53:27.68
you know, the people with their questions, not one of them is military.

2817
02:53:27.68 --> 02:53:28.68
Yeah.

2818
02:53:28.68 --> 02:53:29.68
It's all work.

2819
02:53:29.68 --> 02:53:32.68
Maybe relationship may be here and there, but it's like at work.

2820
02:53:32.68 --> 02:53:33.68
Yeah.

2821
02:53:33.68 --> 02:53:34.68
Yeah.

2822
02:53:34.68 --> 02:53:36.68
And exactly and every one of those situations, we answer them.

2823
02:53:36.68 --> 02:53:40.68
I'd say we answer them with both business examples that we've experienced and military examples.

2824
02:53:40.68 --> 02:53:44.68
But yeah, you, you absolutely, we've seen this the thing.

2825
02:53:44.68 --> 02:53:45.68
We've seen it happen before.

2826
02:53:45.68 --> 02:53:48.68
Whatever that little issue is that you're having,

2827
02:53:48.68 --> 02:53:48.68
Yeah.

2828
02:53:48.68 --> 02:53:49.68
I've seen it before.

2829
02:53:49.68 --> 02:53:50.68
You know, I've seen it before.

2830
02:53:50.68 --> 02:53:51.68
I've seen something like it.

2831
02:53:51.68 --> 02:53:53.68
We'll be able to find an answer.

2832
02:53:53.68 --> 02:53:57.68
It's an unusual conclusion and move forward with the techniques, the principles that we talk about in extreme ownership.

2833
02:53:57.68 --> 02:53:59.68
But it's like this.

2834
02:53:59.68 --> 02:54:00.68
Extreme ownership.

2835
02:54:00.68 --> 02:54:03.68
The book is an awesome way to get the fundamental principles.

2836
02:54:03.68 --> 02:54:08.68
But when you come to the event, now you can really personalize it.

2837
02:54:08.68 --> 02:54:10.68
You know, you can really make sense of it.

2838
02:54:10.68 --> 02:54:11.68
It's just like learning you.

2839
02:54:11.68 --> 02:54:12.68
It's cool.

2840
02:54:12.68 --> 02:54:13.68
Yeah.

2841
02:54:13.68 --> 02:54:14.68
Watch the YouTube videos.

2842
02:54:14.68 --> 02:54:14.68
Yeah.

2843
02:54:14.68 --> 02:54:15.68
Also go to class.

2844
02:54:15.68 --> 02:54:16.68
Also go to the seminar.

2845
02:54:16.68 --> 02:54:20.68
Learn it from as many different angles as you can because the more angles you learn.

2846
02:54:20.68 --> 02:54:24.76
it from the better you the more proficient you'll be at applying them to your world.

2847
02:54:24.76 --> 02:54:30.84
Yeah and that's not, you know you talk about GJ2. Another cool part about it is you

2848
02:54:30.84 --> 02:54:35.64
know when we teach the GJ2 on the last day. Like you can come and actually like roll

2849
02:54:35.64 --> 02:54:41.56
more try to choke. Joko. Yeah you come and bring it. You think it's kind of like you

2850
02:54:41.56 --> 02:54:47.16
know because think about it. Most times like if you go to like a you know oh yeah yeah you can't

2851
02:54:47.16 --> 02:54:51.24
go try to choke the guy at the end of it. You know you can't say like um hey I'm going to go see

2852
02:54:51.24 --> 02:54:55.56
this concert and then afterwards I'm going to pick up guitar and play you know the solos with

2853
02:54:55.56 --> 02:55:00.92
you know you're clapped in. Yeah exactly right. That doesn't happen and that's you can't.

2854
02:55:00.92 --> 02:55:06.52
Yeah and this is like like actually choking up the person you know so that's like an added element you know

2855
02:55:06.52 --> 02:55:11.08
I mean I got to roll with plenty of the guys man it's just so cool to be like oh yeah you know we talking

2856
02:55:11.08 --> 02:55:16.12
we talk about this and then get it off the stairs you know. And so anyways if you didn't make

2857
02:55:16.12 --> 02:55:21.48
it to New York City which was awesome timescwhere we had a great time. The next one we're having

2858
02:55:21.48 --> 02:55:28.12
July 13th and 14th in Austin Texas the Omni Barton Creek resort and spa. Now this is one thing

2859
02:55:28.68 --> 02:55:36.84
that it just is what it is. In New York we we were planning to do like 350 people and then we sold

2860
02:55:36.84 --> 02:55:43.96
that out we opened it up for another 50 and we and we and we and we had to expand our room to get that

2861
02:55:43.96 --> 02:55:49.56
and then that sold out and so then we we rearranged the the the situation in there to get more

2862
02:55:49.56 --> 02:55:54.36
people in there. It looks like in Austin we're capped the we can't get any bigger than the room that we've

2863
02:55:54.36 --> 02:56:01.40
got and so it's 350. So if you want to come sign up quick before it gets sold out because there's no

2864
02:56:01.40 --> 02:56:07.72
way we can expand it into more people. So just be be aware of that. If you can't make that for 13th

2865
02:56:07.72 --> 02:56:13.56
and 14th July 13th and 14th in Austin Texas San Diego California September 14th and 15th we're

2866
02:56:13.56 --> 02:56:19.80
back in San Diego for follow on operations. So come and get it while you're waiting for the

2867
02:56:19.80 --> 02:56:28.28
master if you need to pass communications to myself or echo Charles we can be found on the inner

2868
02:56:28.28 --> 02:56:43.56
webs Twitter Instagram plus we are on that Facebook. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at

2869
02:56:43.56 --> 02:56:49.80
Jocco Willink. And thanks to everyone for listening to the podcast for sharing the podcast for

2870
02:56:49.80 --> 02:56:56.20
supporting the podcast. We really do appreciate it thanks the military personnel out there that are

2871
02:56:56.20 --> 02:57:05.80
protecting our freedoms overseas and also the law enforcement the firefighters EMTs first responders

2872
02:57:05.80 --> 02:57:19.000
that keep us safe here at home thanks to you all and to everyone whatever your mission might be.

2873
02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:28.20
Let's think about Dick Winners personal quest very simple to excel in everything he did.

2874
02:57:31.88 --> 02:57:39.32
Excel and everything he did we should do the same excel in everything we do.

2875
02:57:39.32 --> 02:57:52.84
From working to working now from the way we treat people to the way we treat ourselves

2876
02:57:55.80 --> 02:58:06.04
Excel put forth your greatest effort in everything you do from a small seemingly meaningless

2877
02:58:06.04 --> 02:58:14.44
tasks to the big goals as you attack those goals or as those goals start to grind you down.

2878
02:58:15.24 --> 02:58:26.68
Remember the obsessive pure determined effort that Dick Winners taught us all

2879
02:58:26.68 --> 02:58:42.60
and go out there and get after it. So until next time this is Echo and Jocco out.
