[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 112.
[00:00:05] With echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.
[00:00:08] Good evening echo.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:14] I had a friend and some day when I can, I will tell you all about him.
[00:00:26] But until then for now, I will say that I could not have asked to pray better friend.
[00:00:36] Did he have faults?
[00:00:38] Sure.
[00:00:40] Don't we all?
[00:00:43] Now most of his faults weren't really that big of a deal.
[00:00:49] But they were raw.
[00:00:53] Not because he admitted to them all openly and directly and naively to be honest, in a sort
[00:01:03] of pointed and heavy handed self critique, he would bear his weaknesses to the world
[00:01:09] and to me and to himself.
[00:01:16] He would speak to me as if I had no faults.
[00:01:23] I would try to explain otherwise, but he wouldn't listen.
[00:01:29] He would only judge himself.
[00:01:34] I'm too emotional.
[00:01:36] He would say, not really.
[00:01:40] I tell him.
[00:01:41] I don't know how to talk to people right now.
[00:01:47] Sure you do, let's say.
[00:01:50] I make the same mistakes over and over and over again, he would say, we all do.
[00:01:55] I would tell him.
[00:02:00] I was better than him at some things.
[00:02:03] We both knew that.
[00:02:06] There were other things he was better at than me, but he always downplayed those things.
[00:02:16] And we both knew that too.
[00:02:21] When we were overseas in a bad place, in a wretched place, he never complained.
[00:02:33] And I gave him every reason too.
[00:02:36] I put him in the worst locations with the greatest possible chances for failure and the
[00:02:41] highest probability for fire and fury and blood and death.
[00:02:51] But despite the enemy and the heat and the living conditions and the fear and the wounded
[00:02:59] men and the screams and the misery that was all around, he did not complain.
[00:03:11] It seemed at times that God himself was trying to test the limits of my friend.
[00:03:20] It seemed like sooner or later the bullets or the bombs would find him.
[00:03:32] But through some incomprehensible miracle he survived through that deployment.
[00:03:42] Now I make no claim whatsoever to understand why things in life unfold the way they do.
[00:03:54] In fact, I must say that many of the things I've seen in the world make no sense to me at all.
[00:04:03] Sometimes it's just utter confusion, no rhyme, no reason.
[00:04:10] Some of the things that I've seen have left me downright disgusted, jaded, repulsed,
[00:04:22] sickened by mankind and the awful and reprehensible things we are capable of.
[00:04:34] But there's another side to that.
[00:04:38] There's another side and there are other people who do their best to redeem all the evil
[00:04:44] our souls are capable of.
[00:04:50] My friend was one of those people.
[00:04:55] After deploying with me and surviving that bloody and violent battlefield, my friend, like
[00:05:01] most of the guys in my old job, he volunteered to deploy again.
[00:05:08] I thought and I told him prematurely and incorrectly that the enemy was done.
[00:05:15] I told him that the war was all but over.
[00:05:17] I told him just do the deployment and sit tight over there and play the game.
[00:05:21] And in a few months we'll be back and we can go surfing and we can play guitar and we can
[00:05:24] tell stories and we can cook stakes and we can surf some more.
[00:05:31] I told him we could carry on when he got home.
[00:05:39] That was a plan.
[00:05:42] It was a good plan.
[00:05:48] But the enemy gets a vote and there was intense violence during that deployment for him
[00:05:57] as well.
[00:05:59] It was similar to what we had experienced together overseas and aggressive enemy held
[00:06:04] bent on killing Americans, mixed in an urban environment with a terrified local populace.
[00:06:12] He told me that the enemy he was now facing wasn't as tactically skilled as the enemy
[00:06:17] we had faced but he said that they were braver and more determined.
[00:06:26] That seemed to concern him a bit more.
[00:06:30] He seemed to feel the odds were that he would die.
[00:06:40] He sent me his last will and testament.
[00:06:45] He was not merouse about it just stating the facts.
[00:06:51] It's bad over here.
[00:06:53] The enemy is aggressive, casualty rates are very high.
[00:06:56] The enemy has new weapons that are extremely capable.
[00:07:04] It didn't look good.
[00:07:08] I waited.
[00:07:11] I waited the long and completely powerless weight.
[00:07:17] One known mostly by mothers and fathers and wives and children that are old enough to understand.
[00:07:27] But a weight also made by the brothers at home that know the risk all too well.
[00:07:40] It was a long weight.
[00:07:49] At my friend's memorial service, his brother told the story.
[00:07:59] My friend had talked to his brother on the phone while my friend was on deployment.
[00:08:05] My friend had explained to his brother in no uncertain terms the situation that my friend
[00:08:11] was in.
[00:08:14] The enemy was extremely hostile.
[00:08:15] The battlefield was chaotic.
[00:08:17] The attacks were frequent and furious.
[00:08:22] It was violence that my friend had not experienced before.
[00:08:28] His voice was war unleashed and it seemed to be heading to an inescapable conclusion.
[00:08:38] And my friend's brother sent this.
[00:08:44] Even through the phone even thousands of miles away as his brother, he sent the darkness
[00:08:54] and the overwhelming finality of the situation.
[00:09:03] And he said to my friend, do you need anything for me?
[00:09:07] How can I help?
[00:09:10] Is there anything that I can do?
[00:09:16] My friend was quiet for a moment and then my friend made one simple request.
[00:09:31] He said, pray for my men.
[00:09:43] Now I want you to think about that level of selflessness, that level of faith and of commitment
[00:10:00] and of care for others, that dedication in the face of fear and violence and death
[00:10:11] to at that moment put others' bris before yourself to do good, to be heroic and strong and brave
[00:10:27] and yet at the same time to be humble and to be willing to sacrifice everything for your
[00:10:33] friends.
[00:10:39] That's a man and I couldn't have asked for a better friend.
[00:10:56] The world can be a horrible place.
[00:11:02] It's filled with violence and treachery and sometimes it seems that the legions of demonic
[00:11:08] powers have the upper hand and the battle between good and evil and it can seem that all
[00:11:14] might be lost.
[00:11:20] And then we remember, we see the light and for me the light comes from the example of others
[00:11:33] in this case, another person, another human being.
[00:11:41] My friend who despite all the powers of darkness stood up and rejected all that wickedness
[00:11:47] and proved that there is hope and there is a path to light and we can get on that path
[00:11:59] if we choose to do so like my friend did.
[00:12:08] And that's life.
[00:12:11] At least as far as I can unravel the mystery, that's what I see.
[00:12:16] We are here and the best thing we can do is stand against the darkness and try to spread
[00:12:22] light in the world.
[00:12:28] That can be a very hard thing to do because life is not easy.
[00:12:36] In fact, it is said and there are very few that would deny that life itself is suffering.
[00:12:47] But there is a way.
[00:12:51] And there is a path.
[00:13:00] And today I have someone on the podcast for a second time that I think can help guide us
[00:13:09] down that path away from darkness and toward the light.
[00:13:17] Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, welcome back to the podcast for a second time.
[00:13:27] Thanks, Jorgal.
[00:13:29] You were on podcast number 98 last time and if anyone wants to stop right now, go and listen
[00:13:36] to 98 if you haven't listened to it yet and that's a good place to start learning about
[00:13:41] you and then you could also just google Jordan Peterson and go from there because there's
[00:13:46] thousands of hours of content of you on YouTube.
[00:13:53] Yeah, there's probably horrible as it is to contemplate.
[00:14:00] Yeah, there probably is.
[00:14:02] I mean, I've contributed about 500 hours probably of lectures and so on but people have
[00:14:08] been cutting it up and there's all the podcasts and YouTube videos that other people have
[00:14:12] made and I think I looked the other day because people keep chopping up the lectures and
[00:14:17] the interviews and making little videos and my son and I tried to estimate it last week.
[00:14:21] It looked like 4,000 people have made videos last week in one week.
[00:14:26] Yeah, it's really, yeah, it's crazy.
[00:14:28] It's really, yes.
[00:14:30] Okay, so you've got a new book out and the book is called 12 rules for life and
[00:14:36] an adult to chaos and one of the key points in the book is life is suffering, right?
[00:14:45] And clearly I think.
[00:14:46] I'm in the level of lens.
[00:14:48] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:51] We need to own this on top of that.
[00:14:55] So you need to inflict it.
[00:14:58] You know, obviously my old line of work, we got to see that and we got to see it all the
[00:15:02] time.
[00:15:04] Two things, number one, where is that come from?
[00:15:07] And you don't need to spend a bunch of time on that because you've talked about that so
[00:15:11] much.
[00:15:12] But more important to me, what happens when people miss that point?
[00:15:17] Well, the suffering seems to be built in in some sense and it's a very difficult thing
[00:15:23] to understand fully because the fundamental question is, does being justify suffering?
[00:15:30] It's something like that.
[00:15:32] And there's this old idea.
[00:15:35] I read this, it was a Jewish idea.
[00:15:38] It's kind of a riddle.
[00:15:39] And so it's a riddle about the nature of God.
[00:15:42] And so the riddle runs, what is it being who's omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent?
[00:15:50] So there's the three classical attributes of God, lack.
[00:15:54] I think, well, that's nothing, obviously.
[00:15:58] It's no limitation.
[00:16:00] And so that was the explanation for why God created everything, but more particularly
[00:16:06] why God created man.
[00:16:07] It's that there's something about limitation that adds to completeness.
[00:16:14] Maybe because it provides something to struggle against.
[00:16:16] It's something like that.
[00:16:18] In the book in 12 Rules for Life, I talk about what happens just happened to Superman
[00:16:21] in the 1980s.
[00:16:22] It's like Superman got so powerful that you could bounce hydrogen bombs off his chest.
[00:16:27] You know, he could move planets.
[00:16:28] He's like, and then he got boring at the same time because what are you going to do to
[00:16:32] him?
[00:16:33] Nothing.
[00:16:34] He can just solve every problem instantly.
[00:16:38] Well, there's no story there.
[00:16:40] And you might say, well, who cares if there's a story?
[00:16:42] And that's a reasonable objection.
[00:16:44] Maybe there should just be no story at all.
[00:16:46] That's the Memphis DeFeelian objection to life.
[00:16:48] There should be no story at all.
[00:16:50] But maybe that's not the right answer.
[00:16:53] Maybe it's better to have being even if it requires limitation.
[00:16:58] And if the limitation necessitates suffering, even if the limitation and the suffering necessitate
[00:17:04] evil, that's a separate issue.
[00:17:06] Perhaps there's a way of maneuvering through that a pathway that makes that all not only
[00:17:13] acceptable.
[00:17:14] Let's say at least acceptable.
[00:17:15] That would be a good start.
[00:17:16] But fully justifiable, something that you would voluntarily accept if you had the opportunity.
[00:17:23] It needs your sort of cotton on to that in some sense with his idea of the eternal return.
[00:17:28] He said, you should try to leave each moment of your life so that if you had to live that
[00:17:32] moment recurring for eternity that you would find that desirable.
[00:17:37] It's like, it's a high standard, man.
[00:17:40] But there's a very interesting point there, which is that maybe you can say that despite
[00:17:46] the suffering and malevolence, this is worth it.
[00:17:48] And I think people have experiences like that in their life.
[00:17:52] And you can have more experiences if you live your life, I would say, according, if you're
[00:17:57] on the proper path, then maybe your life can consist of almost nothing but experiences
[00:18:02] like that.
[00:18:03] Now, I say that knowing full well that people get cut off at the knees and that life can
[00:18:09] be very arbitrary and hard and that everyone is prone to the negative consequences of
[00:18:17] deceit and betrayal, all of those things.
[00:18:19] I mean, the book, the book, 12 rules for life in some sense is a very dark book, but
[00:18:24] it's not exactly because the darker the darkness, the brighter the light appears.
[00:18:28] It's something like that.
[00:18:29] And you know, you say, well, no, life's not so bad.
[00:18:33] You can be happy and I think no, life really is bad.
[00:18:36] It's really bad.
[00:18:37] And no matter how bad you think it is, it's actually worse than that.
[00:18:40] You can't really get to the bottom of how terrible things can get.
[00:18:44] People who have post-traumatic stress disorder know that.
[00:18:47] So they've hit something so bad that they cannot live with it.
[00:18:50] They have no idea how to live with it.
[00:18:52] And it hurts them, not just psychologically, but physiologically as well.
[00:18:56] It's very difficult to recover.
[00:18:57] So they have a sense of how bad it can be.
[00:19:00] And then they can hardly live with it.
[00:19:02] But I would say, despite that, and I would say also that this is the central idea in
[00:19:07] the in 12 rules for life is that despite that, bottomless horror in some sense, there
[00:19:13] is a way of being that's powerful enough to both transcend and justify that in some sense.
[00:19:22] And that has to do with the decision to act as if it would be better if things were better.
[00:19:32] That's the first thing.
[00:19:33] And you think, well, that's easy.
[00:19:34] I'd like things to be better.
[00:19:35] No, no, wait a second.
[00:19:37] There's hatred in your heart and there's resentment in your soul.
[00:19:42] And there's bitterness at your position in the world.
[00:19:44] And there's the sense that you're a victim.
[00:19:46] And there's the anger that goes along with that.
[00:19:48] And the desire to hurt, like you have all of that.
[00:19:50] And maybe you have it in spades, maybe it's mostly what you are.
[00:19:54] And because of that, you do not want things to be better.
[00:19:57] You want to spread some misery out of spite.
[00:20:00] And that's what chapter six is about, right?
[00:20:01] Put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.
[00:20:04] It's about people like the Call of Mind High School shooters.
[00:20:07] And exactly what they were motivated by.
[00:20:09] Because I understand what they were motivated by.
[00:20:11] And so to wish that things were better means that you have to make a real decision that
[00:20:16] despite all the flaws of existence, the suffering and the malevolence that it's best not
[00:20:25] to become embedded by that and to work for the betterment of everyone.
[00:20:29] You, for sure, your family, for sure, your community.
[00:20:33] But perhaps even your enemies.
[00:20:35] You know, if you have any sense, you wish your enemies well.
[00:20:39] It doesn't mean you wish them victory.
[00:20:42] It doesn't mean you don't think they're wrong.
[00:20:45] None of that.
[00:20:46] It means that it would be better if the world was set up so that they didn't have to suffer
[00:20:51] miserably and futile and evenly as well.
[00:20:55] That would be better.
[00:20:56] And so then you can aim at that.
[00:20:58] You know, and the best way to aim at that is, well, first of all, they aim at it to actually
[00:21:02] sort yourself out and think, okay, well, if I could have things the way I wanted them to be,
[00:21:07] that's what I would want.
[00:21:09] And that takes a lot of psychological organization before you can state that without, without
[00:21:17] what would you say, without holding anything back, you know, because there's that part
[00:21:21] of you that better part that wants vengeance and wants to wreak havoc.
[00:21:27] That's there.
[00:21:29] It's hard to constrain that.
[00:21:31] And then, well, the other part along with this, as well as aiming at the highest good
[00:21:36] that's attainable, let's say, is to also decide that you're going to speak the truth
[00:21:42] in that endeavor and to risk that, you know, and because I think those are the things
[00:21:48] that help you aren't yourself properly.
[00:21:50] That's the message on the sermon on the mount by the way, which is aim at the highest
[00:21:54] good that you can conceive of and act and tell the truth in that pursuit, right?
[00:22:02] The other element there is to focus on the day once you've aligned yourself with the heavenly
[00:22:09] star, right?
[00:22:10] Aim high and then focus on the day.
[00:22:12] That's very good advice, because it also embuees everything you do in your daily life
[00:22:16] with significance, that's the why am I doing this?
[00:22:19] To avoid hell, that's a good one.
[00:22:21] Let's start with that.
[00:22:22] It's like to avoid hell.
[00:22:23] And if you have any imagination at all, if you live in the world at all, if you're not naive,
[00:22:28] you know what that means.
[00:22:29] And it's not just the hell that you encounter, it's the hell that you foolishly produce
[00:22:33] around yourself and are then responsible for.
[00:22:35] That's a perfect, a good sort of hell.
[00:22:38] So you want to avoid that, for sure.
[00:22:40] And maybe you want to dare risking making things better.
[00:22:45] It's like that'll embue your life with significance.
[00:22:48] And that significance, you know, one of the things I've discovered learned, I would say,
[00:22:52] over the last 25 years, is that there's always been a mythological idea or an idea and literature
[00:22:58] and philosophy that there was a shining path, you know, that you could walk down and modern
[00:23:04] cynical people believe that that sort of meaning, the meaning that would be obtained by
[00:23:09] walking on that path is somehow a loseery or arbitrary.
[00:23:12] And I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever that that's true.
[00:23:16] I think that sense of meaningful engagement, that what is revealed to you when you're in the
[00:23:23] right place at the right time, doing the right thing, that sense of deep engagement, that
[00:23:28] loss of self-consciousness, that feeling that things are worthwhile, that deep seated feeling
[00:23:33] that things are worthwhile.
[00:23:35] That's the most real thing.
[00:23:37] I think the neurobiological evidence suggests that.
[00:23:41] I really do believe that.
[00:23:43] And so we're in a fortunate time in some sense because we can look at those old metaphorical
[00:23:47] ideas of the of the shining path, let's say the the golden path forward.
[00:23:52] And we can say, yeah, that's actually real.
[00:23:56] It's real.
[00:23:57] That's something.
[00:23:58] And then that's what's so cool about that in my estimation is that and this is why
[00:24:03] 12 rules for life is actually an optimistic book.
[00:24:05] It's like the darkness is real, but the light is stronger.
[00:24:09] It's like, wow, could that be true?
[00:24:12] Could that possibly be true?
[00:24:13] I think it's true.
[00:24:15] So that's a good thing to know, man, that that might be true.
[00:24:18] And you know, when I was talking about my friend in the beginning of this podcast, that's
[00:24:23] why I was talking about it because it was a guy who had every reason to be negative and
[00:24:31] to be dark and to look at the world and just say, this is hell, it's not worth it.
[00:24:36] But instead, what he really did was want to take care of his friends.
[00:24:40] I talked about a woman in my book.
[00:24:42] It's like someone I met as a client when I was just beginning my psychotherapy to practice.
[00:24:47] And she just blew me away.
[00:24:49] I've never forgotten her.
[00:24:50] So she had a horrible life.
[00:24:53] She was unattractive, uneducated, no career, unemployed.
[00:25:00] So shy, you can't even imagine it.
[00:25:03] Like you've met someone shy and anxious.
[00:25:04] It's like they weren't in the same universe as this woman.
[00:25:07] She was so shy that she couldn't walk up to people without looking at the ground,
[00:25:12] hunching over and shielding her eyes.
[00:25:14] So that's how she approached people on the street.
[00:25:17] And she looked like a homeless person as well.
[00:25:21] And so she came to the behavior therapy unit that I was working at.
[00:25:26] And hypothetically for treatment.
[00:25:30] And so what we started doing was seeing if we could get her to stand up a bit and look
[00:25:34] people in the eye more normally so that people wouldn't respond to her as if she was so peculiar.
[00:25:40] You know, so we're trying to just to change your behavior.
[00:25:42] But I started talking to her and she told me a little bit about her life.
[00:25:45] It's like she lived at her where she lived.
[00:25:50] Her mother was, I think she lived with her aunt who was like a violent schizophrenic alcoholic
[00:25:55] who had religious delusions and constantly accused her of being possessed by the devil.
[00:26:00] And she had a really violent and abusive alcoholic boyfriend who used to mistreat this woman.
[00:26:06] So that was like, whole life.
[00:26:07] It's like, yeah.
[00:26:09] And she had been an inpatient in this hospital, the Douglas hospital.
[00:26:13] And that was in the 1980s.
[00:26:16] And the Douglas hospital was a huge hospital, both sides of a university campus.
[00:26:20] And it had had a lot of inpatients, but they were all led out on the streets when medication
[00:26:25] became widely available.
[00:26:26] And when deinstitutionalization was the norm.
[00:26:30] But there was a subset of them who couldn't be deinstitutionalized.
[00:26:33] And these were people that you can hardly imagine.
[00:26:36] So I used to go in the underground corridors in the Douglas hospital because it's very cold
[00:26:41] in Montreal, so they're underground corridors collecting the buildings and down there.
[00:26:44] There would be vending machines and places for people to sit.
[00:26:46] And it was like walking through Dante's inferno.
[00:26:49] Because these were people who were so damaged.
[00:26:51] They'd been in psychiatric institution for maybe two or three decades.
[00:26:55] They could not be released no matter what, even though that's what the hospital was trying
[00:26:59] to do.
[00:27:00] And so it was like Diane Arba, used to go across the United States and photograph strange
[00:27:05] people.
[00:27:06] And she has a whole collection of her photographs.
[00:27:08] They're quite arresting and shocking.
[00:27:10] It was like walking through Diane Arba's universe.
[00:27:14] And so those were the inpatient.
[00:27:15] And she had been an inpatient from time to time, but was well enough so she could also
[00:27:19] go out.
[00:27:20] And it turned out she didn't actually want treatment.
[00:27:23] She had this dog.
[00:27:24] She used to take it for walks.
[00:27:26] And so that was her source of enjoyment.
[00:27:28] And she thought, I really liked this dog.
[00:27:31] And I really liked taking it for walks.
[00:27:33] And maybe I could go to the Douglas hospital and find one of these inpatients and take
[00:27:39] him out for a walk.
[00:27:40] Maybe that would be a good thing for him.
[00:27:41] And so the reason she had come to the behavior therapy clinic wasn't to treat all of her
[00:27:45] problems.
[00:27:46] And like this woman had problems, man.
[00:27:49] Everything about her life was a problem.
[00:27:51] In ways that like a normal person just cannot begin to understand, you know.
[00:27:55] Unless they're in one of those situations in their life where everything is collapsing
[00:27:59] around them.
[00:28:00] And what she did, what she decided was, well, there's someone worse off that me than
[00:28:04] me that I could help.
[00:28:06] It's like, she just absolutely blew me away.
[00:28:09] This poor woman, she had nothing going for her.
[00:28:11] Well, I guess she did it because she had this nobility of spirit that was absolutely
[00:28:15] indomitable.
[00:28:16] It's just I never forgot that.
[00:28:19] It just blew me away.
[00:28:20] How lead her into her situation in a way.
[00:28:22] So no one wants to help her.
[00:28:24] Her aunt that's all crazy and you know what that is.
[00:28:27] She wants to help prop up her boyfriend that's violent.
[00:28:29] No, I don't think so.
[00:28:30] I don't think she wanted any of that.
[00:28:32] She was just one of these people.
[00:28:33] It's like, you know, you can put someone in a situation that's so dire that there's
[00:28:40] virtually no escape from it.
[00:28:41] Like I've seen people in my clinical practice for whom things around them have collapsed
[00:28:46] so badly that there's just no fixing it.
[00:28:50] You fix one thing and two other things break and then you fix those and three other things
[00:28:53] break.
[00:28:54] There's just no bottom.
[00:28:55] And those are often families that have had multi-generational problems.
[00:29:01] Basically rooted the whole community is pathologized.
[00:29:04] The entire family structure is demolished.
[00:29:08] There people don't have any marketable skills and they haven't for generations.
[00:29:12] The whole situation is complicated by drug and alcohol abuse and heavily biologically influenced
[00:29:18] insanity of one form.
[00:29:20] Another usually can join with relatively low cognitive ability.
[00:29:24] It's just hell no matter which way you turn.
[00:29:27] I didn't see her as a contributor to that.
[00:29:30] I mean I'm sure she made her mistakes like everyone else but she wasn't playing martyr
[00:29:35] or victim.
[00:29:37] She didn't come into the clinic to complain, to begin with.
[00:29:42] She was just telling me these were the situation that she lived in.
[00:29:46] She wasn't.
[00:29:48] That isn't what she was there for.
[00:29:49] It's just that we thought she had come for treatment so we were doing background analysis,
[00:29:53] you know, an intake interview and found out all these things.
[00:29:55] It's like any one of those problems is enough to bring most people's lives to a
[00:30:00] shuddering halt and yet that was her vision.
[00:30:03] So the reason she had come to the hospital and she didn't just come to the behavior
[00:30:06] of therapy clinic.
[00:30:07] She had gone around pestering administrators in the hospital to let her take the long
[00:30:12] term inmates out for a walk.
[00:30:13] Now they wouldn't do it for all sorts of reasons.
[00:30:17] But that didn't stop her from thinking it was a good idea and it actually was a good
[00:30:21] idea.
[00:30:22] This was a practical idea.
[00:30:23] Like she could have taken people out on the grounds because the grounds were huge and
[00:30:27] walked them with the dog.
[00:30:28] And it would have been fine for.
[00:30:29] There's such a thing as pet therapy in 1985.
[00:30:32] That's not a huge sort of a head of a heart.
[00:30:33] Yeah, well, right.
[00:30:34] Exactly.
[00:30:35] But she had enough wear with all to notice that, well, that she liked the dog and the dog
[00:30:41] like turned out.
[00:30:42] That was a good thing, right?
[00:30:43] A little bit of love in the world there and that there was nothing wrong with taking
[00:30:46] the dog for a walk and that was kind of harmless and why not have someone long.
[00:30:50] They made her feel good.
[00:30:51] She thought, well, maybe it'll make the right sense of feel.
[00:30:53] Exactly.
[00:30:54] So like, you just got to shake your head.
[00:30:57] Well, that's when I really learned to begin with deeply that there's no correlation
[00:31:01] between intelligence and wisdom.
[00:31:03] And that's actually the case, technically like if you're smart, you can just be like,
[00:31:08] you can be smart and good, but you can be smart and bad.
[00:31:11] It's just a, yeah.
[00:31:12] That's it.
[00:31:13] Well, we used to say, okay, so we'd get these guys coming in the sealed teams.
[00:31:15] That would be for a while we were recruiting just the for the officer candidates.
[00:31:20] We were creating these guys that were, you know, they went to Ivy League schools and they were
[00:31:24] off the charts and 1600 on their SATs and then they were the captain of this and they were
[00:31:28] just these really high achievers.
[00:31:32] And we found that not all of them, but certainly some of them couldn't really function
[00:31:36] in the as a leader in the job because they just didn't have the, I guess the wisdom
[00:31:41] to pull it off, but they couldn't make the personal connections.
[00:31:44] They couldn't develop a relationship.
[00:31:46] The leadership's a complicated thing and it doesn't boil down just two intelligence.
[00:31:49] Yeah.
[00:31:50] And I don't want to make it sound like none of them.
[00:31:51] Or because some were obviously outstanding, incredible leaders, but there are some of them
[00:31:56] that would be the same kind of recruit, but they just would just missing whatever piece
[00:31:59] that was.
[00:32:00] Well, intelligence and character are definitely not the same thing.
[00:32:03] They're not the same thing.
[00:32:04] I mean, all things considered if you're going to pick one of two leaders, if I would
[00:32:09] pick the smarter leader over the dollar leader, if all other things were equal, you know,
[00:32:13] because, well, because someone who's more intelligent can strategize more rapidly and
[00:32:18] can handle more variables, right?
[00:32:20] And perhaps can even handle, well, can handle a more rapid rate of transformation as
[00:32:25] well, and sometimes that's actually crucial.
[00:32:27] But character and intelligence are, are, they're clearly not the same thing.
[00:32:32] And character is actually, well, I don't think anything trumps character.
[00:32:35] That's that.
[00:32:36] Character is everything.
[00:32:37] So, you know, it's interesting that you, with this, this woman that you talked about
[00:32:41] in the beginning, you talk about how she's, you know, she's crowd-stown and she's looking
[00:32:46] down with the ground and all that.
[00:32:47] So it's interesting in your rules, obviously, the first rule is to stand up straight
[00:32:55] with your shoulders back, right?
[00:32:57] Well, when you get, for lack of a better word, indoctrinated, in fact, there is no better
[00:33:01] word.
[00:33:02] When you get indoctrinated into the military, that's exactly what's happening.
[00:33:04] And guess what?
[00:33:05] You get taught one of the first things that you get taught is how to stand, how to stand
[00:33:10] properly.
[00:33:11] And you know what they tell you?
[00:33:13] Chin up, chest out, shoulders back.
[00:33:15] They make you stand like that.
[00:33:17] There's no coincidence to that is there.
[00:33:18] Not at all.
[00:33:19] No, no.
[00:33:20] It's a, you could say it's a dominant stance, but that's not the right way of thinking about
[00:33:25] it.
[00:33:26] Although it is a dominant stance, the reason to adopt it is not because it's a dominant
[00:33:30] stance.
[00:33:31] It's a competent stance.
[00:33:33] And competence tends to make you dominant, at least in hierarchies that are functioning
[00:33:38] properly.
[00:33:39] Because you want, there are hierarchies, which is what I outlined in chapter one.
[00:33:42] And I say the hierarchies are old.
[00:33:44] They're not sociocultural constructions.
[00:33:47] They're not a secondary consequence of capitalism in the free market.
[00:33:50] All of that is absolute nonsense.
[00:33:53] It couldn't be more wrong.
[00:33:55] And as an indication of that, I point out that Lobsters, whom we diverged from on the evolutionary
[00:34:01] front, a third of a billion years ago, have hierarchies.
[00:34:05] And that the neurochemical systems, the neurological systems that Lobsters have run
[00:34:11] well, that mediate their hierarchical status, run on the same chemical, that the neurological
[00:34:17] systems that we use to mediate hierarchy run on.
[00:34:20] So that's just absolutely mind boggling.
[00:34:23] But Lobster, like a victorious Lobster, stretches out and adopts a more dominant post.
[00:34:28] Because his serotonin levels go up as he becomes more and more victorious.
[00:34:33] And that governs posture.
[00:34:34] Well, and so to stand up straight with your shoulders back is to open yourself up to
[00:34:39] the world.
[00:34:40] If you're not in the defensive crouch of a prey animal, technically speak it, and that
[00:34:45] is the circuitry that's governing posture.
[00:34:47] It's prey versus predator or something like that.
[00:34:51] And to stand up like that is to expose yourself to the world, but in a bring it on
[00:34:58] sort of manner, not precisely combative, but let's say courageous.
[00:35:03] And your posture announces that.
[00:35:05] And it doesn't just announce that to other people.
[00:35:08] It announces that to yourself and it can start.
[00:35:11] It can be one of those things that can start a virtuous cycle.
[00:35:15] Ocaric, which is partly why it's taught in the military.
[00:35:18] Get these guys that come in.
[00:35:19] They're all slumped over.
[00:35:20] They don't know how to stand up.
[00:35:21] They're looking at their feet.
[00:35:22] They're next or bent.
[00:35:23] Like, even if they're good looking men, they don't look good because they're all crunched
[00:35:27] over.
[00:35:28] You see people like this on the street all the time.
[00:35:30] They could be perfectly attractive, except they're completely huddled in.
[00:35:33] And they need to stand up and stretch themselves out.
[00:35:36] And then they can breathe too.
[00:35:37] And that's a competent stance.
[00:35:40] One of the things that the critics of the modern West don't understand about hierarchies
[00:35:46] is that first of all, they're everywhere.
[00:35:48] They're inevitable.
[00:35:49] If you're going to have a distinction of value between things, you have a hierarchy.
[00:35:53] And if you don't want to get rid of the distinction of values between things because
[00:35:57] then you don't have anything to do.
[00:35:58] That's foolish.
[00:35:59] You can't live that way.
[00:36:01] So I say, well, the hierarchies are based on power.
[00:36:05] It's like, no, they're not.
[00:36:07] They're based on competence.
[00:36:09] And there isn't anything more powerful than competence.
[00:36:11] But power isn't tyranny.
[00:36:13] It's not brutality.
[00:36:14] It's not threat.
[00:36:15] It might be the hint of all those things.
[00:36:18] Because I don't think you can be fully competent without being able to hint at those things.
[00:36:22] But hierarchies in the West are fundamentally based on competence.
[00:36:26] It doesn't mean they're not flawed because we miss the mark.
[00:36:29] Lots.
[00:36:30] And there's lots of reasons why perfectly competent people don't attain the position that
[00:36:34] they deserve and that they should have for their benefit in everyone else's.
[00:36:38] The hierarchies are tainted by corruption.
[00:36:41] But fundamentally, they're fundamentally based on competence.
[00:36:46] And that's.
[00:36:47] So with that, this first rule that you put in about book.
[00:36:52] And you're saying that's a cycle that can go backwards.
[00:36:54] So you don't have to have the serotonin first.
[00:36:56] And then you stand up.
[00:36:57] If you stand up straight, you'll somehow increase your serotonin over that.
[00:37:01] Yeah, definitely.
[00:37:02] Definitely.
[00:37:03] So you say you could inject lobsters with serotonin and they start to stand straighter.
[00:37:08] Yeah, you can basically give them anti-depressants.
[00:37:11] So like if a lobster gets defeated in a fight, then he's statistically more likely to
[00:37:15] lose the next fight than you would guess from a telly of his previous victories.
[00:37:19] So that's the first thing.
[00:37:21] If you lose, you increase your risk of further loss.
[00:37:24] But if you win, you increase your risk of future gains.
[00:37:27] That's a very important principle.
[00:37:29] It's a crucially important principle.
[00:37:30] It governs life.
[00:37:31] But yeah, if you take a lobster and he gets all defeated and he's off pouting and won't
[00:37:35] fight anymore because he's having a bad day and you inject him with serotonin, essentially
[00:37:41] give him anti-depressants.
[00:37:42] It's the same thing.
[00:37:43] Then he'll straighten up and he'll go out and have another scrap.
[00:37:46] And I read that, oh, I don't know.
[00:37:48] It's probably at least 10 years ago when I was reading about the neurophysiology of these
[00:37:53] neurochemical systems, that's why I go it onto it.
[00:37:56] It just was another thing that just blew me away.
[00:37:57] I thought, really, you're kidding.
[00:37:59] That circuit is that old.
[00:38:00] It's like it's that old, that's way before there were trees.
[00:38:05] That's how long ago that is.
[00:38:06] So hierarchy is a patriarchal construction.
[00:38:11] How about no?
[00:38:12] How about that's wrong and seriously wrong.
[00:38:15] So I was talking to one of my friends in the last year's show.
[00:38:18] He's got a kid that's wrestling.
[00:38:20] His kid is six years old, I think.
[00:38:22] Dom and he says, you know, he's getting put into the higher category.
[00:38:27] He's kind of getting his butt whip now.
[00:38:29] And I'm really not sure what do you think.
[00:38:30] And I said, well, you want him to win because when he wins, it's more fun.
[00:38:35] And he has more fun.
[00:38:36] So now I have actual more evidence that you should get your kids in a position.
[00:38:40] Again, I think your kids should get beat sometimes.
[00:38:42] Yeah.
[00:38:43] But they should certainly not get beat down all the time.
[00:38:47] Exactly.
[00:38:48] I did that to my kids when my kids first started you, Jitu.
[00:38:50] I put them, oh, you're going to compete because I'm telling you to.
[00:38:53] Yeah.
[00:38:54] And then I'm going to put you in a higher weight class with older kids.
[00:38:57] Because that's going to make you tougher.
[00:38:58] That was my, you know, stupid thinking.
[00:39:00] And now with my younger start, I'm like, no, no, no, you go out and you have fun.
[00:39:04] And you go out and you compete against people that are somewhat equal to you.
[00:39:07] Maybe a little bit below you, maybe a little higher.
[00:39:08] But depending on your mood, time.
[00:39:10] Yeah.
[00:39:11] Yeah.
[00:39:12] Well, that's absolutely.
[00:39:13] Well, that's I think we could, we can think about that also in terms of the conversation
[00:39:17] about meaning that we started to have.
[00:39:19] It's like, if you win all the time, that's meaningless.
[00:39:22] Because, well, I mean, think why?
[00:39:24] Because you want to win.
[00:39:25] It's like, yeah, fair enough.
[00:39:27] So why would winning all the time become meaningless?
[00:39:29] It's because your theory of winning isn't sophisticated enough.
[00:39:33] Because here's how you win.
[00:39:35] You play the game to win.
[00:39:38] But while you're playing, you play in a way so that you get better at the game.
[00:39:41] Right?
[00:39:42] Because you're going to play a bunch of games.
[00:39:43] Well, it's even more than that.
[00:39:44] You play the game to win, but you play it so that you get better at the game.
[00:39:48] Okay, fine, that makes sense.
[00:39:49] So you want to push yourself, right?
[00:39:51] Because that's how you get better.
[00:39:52] And so you need competition to push yourself.
[00:39:53] So you need to have the risk of loss.
[00:39:55] Because otherwise you won't do it.
[00:39:57] But here's an even better way of thinking about it.
[00:39:59] You play the game so that you don't only get better at that game, but you get better at
[00:40:03] the entire set of possible games.
[00:40:06] And that's what you do when you're a good sport.
[00:40:08] It's like, well, so how do you do that?
[00:40:09] Well, partly, you find the proper level of competition.
[00:40:13] So you want to be pushed so that you will make the effort necessary to remove what's useless
[00:40:23] about yourself and to help foster the growth of what's useful.
[00:40:28] And if you do that, then you get the joy of participating in the game towards victory.
[00:40:35] But the extra joy of building yourself more and more strongly at the same time.
[00:40:41] And so when you tell your kid, doesn't matter whether you win or lose.
[00:40:45] It's how you play the game.
[00:40:47] Your kid says, what do you mean by that?
[00:40:49] And you say, I don't know.
[00:40:51] I don't know what I mean by that.
[00:40:54] Because the kid says, I'm supposed to win, aren't I?
[00:40:56] It's like, well, yeah.
[00:40:57] So why does it matter how I play the game?
[00:40:59] It's like, well, then you're stumped.
[00:41:00] Even though you're right, you just don't know why.
[00:41:02] But the reason is, is you want to tell you, here's the reason.
[00:41:05] It's like, we can make this very simple.
[00:41:09] Life is not a game.
[00:41:10] It's a series of games.
[00:41:11] It's actually a series of diverse games.
[00:41:13] Okay, so who's the winner of this series of diverse games?
[00:41:17] Because that's the real question, right?
[00:41:19] Not who wins a game.
[00:41:20] It's like whatever you win a game.
[00:41:22] It's like, if I hold a gun to your head and we're playing chess,
[00:41:25] I could say lose.
[00:41:26] It's like I win.
[00:41:27] It's like, well, that's not how full, obviously.
[00:41:31] So you want to teach your kid.
[00:41:33] You want to help your kid learn to be the winner of the set of diverse games.
[00:41:38] Okay, so what does that winner look like?
[00:41:39] Well, here's the first clue.
[00:41:42] That's the person who keeps getting invited to play.
[00:41:45] So because you win, if people invite you to play all the time,
[00:41:49] you have opportunities coming to you just non-stop.
[00:41:52] And maybe, like, let's say you have 50 opportunities
[00:41:56] and each of them are potentially 50% for you
[00:41:59] and 50% for the other person.
[00:42:01] You think, well, that's pretty good deal.
[00:42:03] And then you think, well, wait a minute, let's flip this around.
[00:42:05] So it's like 60% for the other person and 40% for me.
[00:42:09] I'm gonna be like, I'm gonna go,
[00:42:10] I'm gonna overboard in the generosity.
[00:42:12] You think, well, then what happens?
[00:42:15] Well, then instead of having 20 opportunities
[00:42:16] at every moment, you have like 50 opportunities at every moment.
[00:42:20] And that's what you want for your kids is you want
[00:42:23] all the invisible doors around them to open.
[00:42:26] And you do that by saying, play nobly, right?
[00:42:31] Pay attention to your teammates, pass the damn puck.
[00:42:34] So they get a chance, right?
[00:42:35] Even if you're the best player on the team,
[00:42:37] help the people on your team develop.
[00:42:39] Don't grandstand, right?
[00:42:41] If you have the opportunity to beat your opponent
[00:42:46] 20 to one in goals, doesn't happen very often,
[00:42:49] but it can, especially when kids are playing.
[00:42:51] It's like, well, maybe after you're up seven to one,
[00:42:54] it's like, back off a bit.
[00:42:57] You don't have to humiliate your opponents.
[00:43:00] Because it's what would you say?
[00:43:03] It's contemptible behavior on your part.
[00:43:06] And so, you know that because you go and watch
[00:43:09] a hockey game or something like that,
[00:43:10] and you watch a kid that really knows how to play.
[00:43:13] It's like they're playing like mad to win.
[00:43:15] They're pushing themselves to be better,
[00:43:17] but they're paying attention to their damn teammates.
[00:43:19] And they respect their opponents.
[00:43:22] And you think, well, that's a hell of a kid there.
[00:43:24] It's like, yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:43:26] That kid's going somewhere.
[00:43:27] Do kids ever show, they get so committed.
[00:43:31] Let's say hockey, right?
[00:43:32] You get a kid that's just so committed to winning
[00:43:34] and hockey that he's gonna lose at other games?
[00:43:36] Well, that's another game's in life, right?
[00:43:38] That's another problem.
[00:43:39] Well, that's another problem is like...
[00:43:40] So you could be over-borg.
[00:43:42] Yeah, well, well, the other thing too
[00:43:44] is that with sports, like you could say,
[00:43:46] well, most kids aren't gonna be NHL level hockey players.
[00:43:49] Like, that's impossible.
[00:43:50] Like, maybe you should aim for that.
[00:43:51] I would say probably not, because it's so damn unlikely.
[00:43:54] But whatever, some kids are gonna manage that
[00:43:57] and more power to them.
[00:43:58] Say, well, what are the sports for the rest of the kids?
[00:44:02] And the answer to that is, well, obviously,
[00:44:03] there's the physical discipline and the health
[00:44:05] that goes along with that.
[00:44:06] And the ability to engage in and tolerate competition
[00:44:10] and learn how to be a gracious winner and a gracious loser.
[00:44:13] But a lot of it is correct.
[00:44:15] That all that's part of character building.
[00:44:17] Well, that's what you want.
[00:44:18] You say, well, why build your character?
[00:44:20] It's like, well, how about...
[00:44:22] That's your set of tools for dealing with catastrophe.
[00:44:27] How about that for a reason?
[00:44:29] Right?
[00:44:30] So one of the things I've suggested to my viewers,
[00:44:33] this is the man in particular, but not just the man,
[00:44:36] you should be the most reliable person at your father's funeral.
[00:44:41] That's a good goal, man.
[00:44:43] That's a good goal because everyone's broken
[00:44:45] in a situation like that.
[00:44:46] And you adding to that brokenness and misery.
[00:44:49] I mean, you're gonna be grieving, like, no doubt about it.
[00:44:52] And no kidding.
[00:44:53] But there is a time to step forward with some character.
[00:44:57] You know, it's the same thing.
[00:44:58] You're gonna be at someone's deathbed.
[00:45:00] You're gonna be quibbling with your siblings
[00:45:01] while you're doing that?
[00:45:02] Well, your parents dying?
[00:45:04] It's like, it's bad enough that they're dying.
[00:45:06] That's tragedy, right?
[00:45:07] But you'd can turn that into hell, no problem.
[00:45:10] You just get a bunch of people with no character around a deathbed.
[00:45:13] And it's like, well, it's bad enough,
[00:45:16] but that turns it into something like hell.
[00:45:18] And that happens in people's lives all the time.
[00:45:20] It's like character is everything.
[00:45:22] So, and that's why the wise people of our past tradition
[00:45:26] insisted upon that.
[00:45:28] You say, well, don't lie.
[00:45:29] Well, why not?
[00:45:30] Well, destroys your character.
[00:45:31] Well, so what?
[00:45:32] Well, then you turn suffering into hell.
[00:45:34] Is that what you want?
[00:45:36] Maybe, you know, because people will want that.
[00:45:39] But I would say walk away from people like that, right?
[00:45:44] That's not unless that's what you want, then.
[00:45:48] Yeah, you've got a lot of, I mean, it's interesting
[00:45:51] as since I just got done reading the book, you know,
[00:45:54] I can hear you just hitting the wave tropps
[00:45:56] of all the different rules and they're all interconnected
[00:45:58] about don't lie or tell the truth or at least don't lie.
[00:46:03] And then hang, what's the chapter about hang around with people
[00:46:07] that want to see you do well?
[00:46:08] Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:09] Yeah, yeah, make friends with people who want the best
[00:46:11] for you.
[00:46:12] Right.
[00:46:13] Yeah, so, well, and it's a really, it's a real technical idea.
[00:46:16] So, Carl Rogers, who's a psychotherapist, great psychotherapist,
[00:46:20] had very much recommend his books to people, especially if they
[00:46:23] want to learn to listen because he was really good at teaching
[00:46:26] people how to listen.
[00:46:27] He had this idea that what he would manifest towards his clients
[00:46:31] in therapy was unconditional positive regard.
[00:46:35] And I've always had trouble with that because, well, because you
[00:46:38] don't treat your children, for example, with unconditional
[00:46:41] positive regard.
[00:46:42] You mean, there's no matter what someone says, you're saying,
[00:46:44] yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:46:45] Yeah, that's why it's tricky.
[00:46:47] Well, what he didn't articulate it, I think, as well as he
[00:46:51] might have, what you want to do is for your child is that you
[00:46:55] want the best for the best in them.
[00:46:59] That's what you want.
[00:47:00] And that's what you want from people that you surround yourself
[00:47:03] with.
[00:47:03] Now, they'll hold you to a high standard if that's the case,
[00:47:06] right?
[00:47:06] Because whenever you degenerate in any of the multiple ways
[00:47:10] that you're likely to degenerate, they're going to like,
[00:47:12] whack you on the back of the head and say, you know,
[00:47:14] clue the hell in, you know, you're demeaning yourself,
[00:47:17] you're less than you could be.
[00:47:19] And there's real judgment in it, and it's harsh.
[00:47:22] But with friends, it's the same thing.
[00:47:24] You want friends.
[00:47:26] They're not friends if they're not these people.
[00:47:28] You want friends who, when something good happens to you,
[00:47:31] they're at, that's good for you, right?
[00:47:34] They're happy about that.
[00:47:35] They're not like all better in resentful underground
[00:47:37] and like saying horrible things behind your back
[00:47:39] and telling you how they did something that was better
[00:47:41] and trying to drag you down.
[00:47:43] It's like that's not helpful.
[00:47:45] And then when something bad happens to you and you go to them
[00:47:48] and you say, look, this terrible thing happened to me.
[00:47:50] First of all, they don't try to top it with some like horrible
[00:47:53] thing that happened to them because they don't have the patience
[00:47:56] to listen and second, they're not secretly gloating
[00:47:59] about the fact that catastrophe finally be failure.
[00:48:02] It's like they're actually hurt by it.
[00:48:04] And that chapter is an injunction.
[00:48:06] It's like take a look at the people that are around you.
[00:48:08] And if they're not on this side of what's good for you,
[00:48:13] then walk away because, well, first of all, that's best for them too.
[00:48:18] If you put up with that, all you're doing is enabling it.
[00:48:21] It's like, well, it's okay that you mistreat me in a way
[00:48:24] that's harmful to me and everyone else.
[00:48:26] It's like, actually, no, that is not okay.
[00:48:28] It's not the least bit okay.
[00:48:31] It doesn't mean you shouldn't try to help someone
[00:48:33] when they're down.
[00:48:34] That's a whole different issue.
[00:48:35] What if it's your family?
[00:48:37] So you know, you say, like, walk away, right?
[00:48:39] Yeah.
[00:48:40] Do you still walk away from your family?
[00:48:42] Or do you do if it's necessary?
[00:48:44] Yeah.
[00:48:45] There's lots of different ways of walking away.
[00:48:47] Oh, yeah.
[00:48:47] They'll create boundaries.
[00:48:48] Well, there's that for sure.
[00:48:50] There's that.
[00:48:51] I mean, you sometimes someone's on an
[00:48:54] incorrigible path.
[00:48:56] Like, there's just nothing you can do.
[00:48:58] You know, maybe they're aiming down.
[00:49:00] They're aiming down hard.
[00:49:02] And they're better and everything they do is to produce misery,
[00:49:05] virtually everything.
[00:49:06] And you have to detach yourself from that.
[00:49:08] It's like I always think about it from the perspective of a lifeguard.
[00:49:12] So if you're training to be a lifeguard,
[00:49:14] one of the things that you're trained to do
[00:49:16] is to approach someone who's drowning and panicking.
[00:49:20] And the way you approach them is you put your foot out
[00:49:22] between you and them and you push forward with your hands
[00:49:26] with your foot out.
[00:49:27] And you basically tell them if they're flailing about,
[00:49:29] you say, look, I'm here to help.
[00:49:31] But you have to calm down.
[00:49:32] And then if they cling to you, like in panic,
[00:49:34] you push them away.
[00:49:36] You think, well, that's pretty damn cruel because what if they drown?
[00:49:38] It's like, yeah, what if you both drown?
[00:49:41] That's like not helpful.
[00:49:42] You're there to rescue them.
[00:49:44] They take you down.
[00:49:45] You're both dead.
[00:49:46] It's like fail, right?
[00:49:48] So you say, look, good panicking.
[00:49:50] I'll help you out. But I'm not drowning along with you.
[00:49:53] It's like, well, it's the same with someone in your family.
[00:49:56] It's like, if they're on a downward path and you've done your best,
[00:50:00] you know, you've made your efforts, you've and they're not paying attention.
[00:50:04] They're not changing.
[00:50:05] They say, yeah, well, I'll quit doing this.
[00:50:07] Yeah, I'll quit doing this.
[00:50:07] They tell you the same story over and over and over.
[00:50:10] It's a downhill path.
[00:50:11] You don't trust it.
[00:50:12] At some point, first of all, you stop offering your words.
[00:50:17] That's do not cast pearls before swine, a very, very harsh statement, right?
[00:50:23] But what it means is, if someone, if you're offering words of wisdom to someone,
[00:50:30] in the genuine attempt help and they treat that with contempt,
[00:50:34] then shut up because you're demeaning your words by throwing them away.
[00:50:42] You think, well, how do you help someone who's aiming down?
[00:50:44] Well, sometimes you help them by walking away and saying, look,
[00:50:47] you're aiming down so hard that I am, despite the fact,
[00:50:51] you're my brother, man, it's like, you know, this is killing me.
[00:50:54] You're aiming down so hard.
[00:50:56] I'm not coming along with you.
[00:50:58] And the reason I'm not is to tell you and no uncertain terms
[00:51:01] that what you're doing is so terrible that I will even violate our kinship to oppose it.
[00:51:06] And maybe it'll take them 10 years to wake up to that, you know?
[00:51:10] And that can be the case because, you know, people often have to be hit so many times before they'll
[00:51:17] learn. You see that especially if someone's addicted or otherwise pursuing a pathway that's
[00:51:23] like seriously downhill. So, yeah.
[00:51:27] You cover that pretty well in that chapter where you're saying,
[00:51:31] there's a certain point where you just got to say, you know, we're done.
[00:51:34] Yeah, we're done. Well, it's like, why should I think that you're actually trying to change?
[00:51:39] Maybe you're just telling me, is you're, you tell me the story that you use to justify your own
[00:51:44] idiocy to yourself. And then you tell it to me and you demand that because I'm compassionate,
[00:51:49] I accept it and therefore validate your excuse. It's like, well, that like, it's really hard not
[00:51:54] to get tangled up in that, right? Because if someone who's really in rough shape is telling you
[00:51:58] about why they're suffering, first of all, they're probably about half right in their story.
[00:52:03] But some of its justification and excuse and blaming and all of that failure to take responsibility.
[00:52:09] It's really hard to stand up and say, no, I don't buy that. No, I don't buy that. No,
[00:52:12] you're wrong about that. You have to be a brutal bastard in order to do that. But hey,
[00:52:18] sometimes like surgery is brutal, right? It's brutal, but you're a lot of
[00:52:25] cut you open and we're going to rip out part of your body, right? Right, right? Exactly.
[00:52:30] Right, precisely. And so, so this chapter about, you know, only making friends with people who
[00:52:37] want the best for you, that's a brutal chapter. But it's right, unfortunately.
[00:52:45] Going to your book a little bit, I'm going to pick up, going back to that first
[00:52:51] thought. Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of being. Your nervous system
[00:52:58] response and an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily.
[00:53:03] You respond to a challenge instead of bracing for a catastrophe. You see the gold, the dragon
[00:53:09] hordes instead of shrinking in terror from the all-to-real fact of the dragon. You step forward
[00:53:15] to take your place in the dominance hierarchy and occupy your territory,
[00:53:21] manifesting your willingness to defend, expand and transform it. To stand up straight with your
[00:53:27] shoulders back as to accept the terrible responsibility of life with eyes wide open. The reason I
[00:53:35] pulled that one out in particular is the feeling that you have as a soldier or as a military person.
[00:53:42] A feeling that you have going on an offensive operation? Where let's say you're a bad guy and
[00:53:46] I'm going to come and get you. First of all, you don't know. And I'm sneaking up on you and I have
[00:53:51] all this power, right? I feel good about it. I'm going to get you. The opposite of that is when I'm
[00:53:58] doing a convoy or I'm going on a patrol. We're now the bad guys are out there. They're waiting
[00:54:02] to attack me and that is a defensive posture and you're attitude about that type of thing
[00:54:06] is bad. Now we were train our guys that we made a specific point with my guys I would say,
[00:54:14] look, when you're on patrol, we're on offense. We are scanning. We are looking to get the
[00:54:20] to get us to be standing up straight and to get the mentality of we want to do this and we're moving
[00:54:26] towards the target as opposed to we're being chased. That's a big deal. It's absolutely that's a big
[00:54:32] deal. Yeah and that's what would you say? That's an extreme example of what's necessary
[00:54:39] under normal conditions in life. So what one of the things that happens if you're treating someone
[00:54:43] who has a phobias, like agro phobias, they become afraid of virtually everything. Maybe they're
[00:54:50] afraid of an elevator. It's one of many fears and so you think well. They're afraid of an
[00:54:55] elevator because they've actually gone in elevators and had panic attacks. So it's weird because
[00:54:58] what you do to cure them is to get them to go in elevators and you think, well wait a second,
[00:55:02] that's actually what caused the problem. So how can getting them to do that again make it better?
[00:55:08] And that answer is because they've gone in elevators their whole life, right? And yet they still
[00:55:11] become terrified. So how can getting them to go in an elevator cure them? For a long time people thought,
[00:55:17] well you get them to relax while they were in the elevator and the pairing of the relaxation
[00:55:22] with being in the elevator taught them to not be afraid. That was the first theory but then people
[00:55:26] learned that no you could just get them to go in the elevator without having them relax and it
[00:55:30] also worked. And eventually psychologists sorted this out and what they figured out was that
[00:55:35] voluntarily encountering something you're afraid of is not the same thing as running from it.
[00:55:41] Like it's seriously not the same thing. So you say to the person, okay you're afraid of the
[00:55:45] elevator, let's can you go look at an elevator? They usually say yes and maybe they're so terrified
[00:55:51] because they're so far gone in their illness that they can't say well how about we look at a bunch
[00:55:54] of pictures of elevators and it's like virtually everyone can do that. So let's look at pictures of
[00:55:59] elevators till your board. That actually doesn't take very long because it's actually quite boring.
[00:56:03] So then the next thing would be, well let's go you have to have the person trust you and so
[00:56:08] the rule is look we're going to do some things that are going to push you like competition.
[00:56:13] Right. But you can stop whenever you want and we're not going to push you any farther than
[00:56:17] is good for you and I'll stop anytime you want. I often practice with my clients like I
[00:56:21] taught one client a while back to not be afraid of needles and he was afraid of needles and I'll
[00:56:26] tell you what that meant. He had dental surgery with no anesthesia. Right. Okay so that gives you
[00:56:33] some level of what it's like to be afraid. It's like all do the dental surgery but you're not
[00:56:37] putting that needle in there. It's really? It's like I'm no needles. So I taught him how to not be afraid
[00:56:44] of needles. You know and it didn't take very long but the first thing I did is said I told him I was
[00:56:50] going to bring a needle into the office and that was all I told him the first week is next week
[00:56:54] I'm going to bring a needle in here and I'm going to keep it sheathed and it's going to be sitting
[00:56:59] on a shelf and that's where I'm going to put it and when you come in here you can look at it
[00:57:03] and if you want me to put it away then I'll put it away. It's under your control and then so he was
[00:57:08] okay without. So he came in and there's the needle said you want to look at it and said no it's
[00:57:11] but canyots like I'll look at it. So he looked at it and then it said look like I'm going to pick up the
[00:57:16] needle and now what you're going to do is you're going to tell me to put it down and I'm going to put it
[00:57:21] down so I picked it up and he got nervous like right away and he said well you put that down
[00:57:26] I put it down right away so we do that 10 times so that the bottom part of your nervous system
[00:57:33] actually knows that that's what's going to happen. Said now and then the next thing we'll do is
[00:57:38] we're going to practice you saying you've had enough and leaving the office so I pick up the
[00:57:43] needle and he'd say okay so now you say you've had enough I'm leaving and so he said that and then
[00:57:48] I'd let him leave we did that like 10 times so that he knew that he could just say he'd have
[00:57:52] enough and leave so that mean he didn't have to be a prey animal right so we're getting them out of
[00:57:57] that mode and it didn't take very long until well then I could bring the needle close to him and
[00:58:03] I say make sure you watch it you can't pretend it's not there right I'll bring it close to him
[00:58:07] and touch him with the sheath needle so we did that a bunch and then finally I unsheathed it and I
[00:58:13] bring it close and he tolerate that or stopped me and then I'd touch him with that and then
[00:58:18] the last part of it was that I put it under a piece of paper so he couldn't see it and then I'd
[00:58:24] bring it close to him right because that was that was the unknown right you don't know what the hell
[00:58:28] it's going on underneath the piece of paper but he got to the point where he could go and have a needle
[00:58:33] I took on about it was very brave of him to do this because well what had happened he got what had
[00:58:38] happened to him is he had a very bad experience with the childhood dentist I was held down the same
[00:58:42] one where the hell oh yeah held him six people held him down to give him a needle it's like
[00:58:48] what was that so good it had some long-term consequences but see what happened so when you when you do
[00:58:53] that with people you don't teach them to be less afraid you teach them to be braver that's different
[00:59:00] and so like I had a client once the door is open on the elevator and she looked and she said that's
[00:59:05] death like that's a tomb and I thought wow that's an amazing response and her idea was she'd go in
[00:59:09] there her hardweight would accelerate she'd have a hard attack and she'd die so as far as she was
[00:59:14] concerned walking in there was death right okay so for me it was an elevator but for her it was death
[00:59:19] it's like okay well what do you do about your fear of death well we're not getting rid of that it's like
[00:59:26] you know and you could die in the elevator you actually could probably you won't but people do
[00:59:30] die in elevators and her idea was that well if anyone has ever died in an elevator in the history of
[00:59:35] mankind that's a good reason for me not to be in the elevator it's like fair enough you know and why aren't
[00:59:40] you terrified of out of your skull all the time because while you're wondering around you might have a
[00:59:44] heart attack like that will probably in fact happen to you at some point so why aren't you terrified of
[00:59:50] that at every moment well that's the mystery well so you treat people and and you see without
[00:59:56] client what I eventually did with hers we went and watched an abomining she was terrified of death
[01:00:01] like seriously yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right no kidding but you know so you get you don't get
[01:00:12] less afraid you get braver that's better because there's plenty of things to be afraid of but you can
[01:00:18] get braver so that's something people manage this on their own ever oh yeah yeah people manage it
[01:00:23] on their own they'd manage it on their own all the time like you know let's say you're in a
[01:00:27] ratty horrible job and you're being oppressed by your boss and one day you think I've had enough
[01:00:31] and you go right your resume it's like there you go that's what you're doing it's like you know you're
[01:00:35] you're because you think well I've got the devil I know and and then there's the devil I don't
[01:00:41] know and that's relevant when you're when you're trying to switch careers can I find another job
[01:00:45] well anyone hire me how long will this take to I have to get educated again I've to put my resume
[01:00:49] together that's a real pain because there's holes in it and I don't know how to present myself
[01:00:53] then I have to go to interviews and it's like oh my god that's no you know that's a lot of trouble
[01:00:58] well then you think no I'm I'm gonna start that I'm gonna rewrite my resumes like well then
[01:01:04] up you get right just your moving forward in your life you're not taken being tyrannized by your
[01:01:11] son of a bitch of a boss and you're out to do something about it you know and people can get really
[01:01:16] good at that so one of the things you do is a psychotherapist is just you do assertiveness training
[01:01:21] it's like so people come and they say help help I'm being oppressed in that famous
[01:01:25] Monty Python in the famous Monty Python manner and you say okay look well first of all you're
[01:01:31] probably whining a lot so let's figure that out so you quit whining and then let's figure out how you
[01:01:36] actually are oppressed and what might be done about it and then let's figure out a strategy and then
[01:01:42] let's help you practice the strategy until you get good at it and and let's also map out the
[01:01:47] consequences of not fixing it because people think well how can I stand up to my boss it's like that's
[01:01:53] terrible I might risk my jobs like yeah fair enough no wonder you're afraid of that maybe you should just
[01:01:58] shut up let's see what your life would be like in 10 years if you just shut up it's like you know how
[01:02:04] about it is now it's like it's gonna be way worse than that because you're gonna shrink and shrink
[01:02:08] and shrink and your boss is gonna become more and more tyrannical and you're gonna hate every
[01:02:13] minute of your life and it's like you want that or do you want to confront your boss or change jobs
[01:02:18] it's like oh I see it's like hell here it's hell here I get it I get to pick which of those I'm
[01:02:24] going to walk down and that's a relief to people most of the time it's so funny because people often think they have
[01:02:32] their their paralyzed because they think that there's a good option right yeah but what are the
[01:02:37] things you do is a psychotherapist to say oh no you no no you're screwed no matter which way you turn it's
[01:02:42] it's like a crocodile here and it's a wolf there and and behind you there's a hyena it's like
[01:02:47] there's no lambs you're not in lament territory it's all predators well pick your battle pick your
[01:02:56] battle and then all of a sudden you're in battle and then it doesn't matter that it's a hyena because
[01:03:01] you're warrior so fine bring it on this is a common to another point that I picked up from the book
[01:03:09] that I have a leadership management consultant company so I work with companies all the time and
[01:03:13] one of the topics has come up a bunch in the past couple of years is you know when you're dealing with
[01:03:18] someone you're dealing with an employee and you got firearm and how this is a big hard conversation
[01:03:23] and et cetera except or no one wants to have those and I always say look if you have the hard
[01:03:29] conversation earlier it's not so hard because all I have to tell you say Jordan you know you were
[01:03:34] late today and we're not supposed to be late and you all sorry and the problems sort of self-out
[01:03:39] or it doesn't and then I got escalated yeah but what you talk about in the book is if there's a
[01:03:44] problem go attack it you can go get that problem solved don't go after that drag you know the dragons in
[01:03:50] there go get it well your observation is dead on it's like and this is the problem with being too
[01:03:55] nice like I don't what regard nice is a virtue or if it's a virtue it's a very low order virtue
[01:04:00] because what nice usually means but nice usually means is I don't want to cause conflict now even
[01:04:07] though the consequences of the conflict might multiply into the future so let's say you have an
[01:04:12] employee that's chronically late right and but you I don't want to I don't really want to disturb
[01:04:16] them I don't want to cause any trouble it's like while you're angry about it because they're late
[01:04:20] and they're not supposed to be so you're getting all bitter and resentful plus you're not doing
[01:04:23] the many favors you know because you're also telling them that you can be taken advantage of
[01:04:28] and that they're lack of discipline is okay and then you know so then you're going to dislike the
[01:04:33] employee and you're going to amplify their other errors in your because of your distaste and then
[01:04:38] and if they are someone who's taking advantage of you then they're going to take advantage of you
[01:04:41] a little more and then a little more and a little more and a little more and then you're going to have
[01:04:45] to have a really difficult conversation or put up with it and that might sink your business especially
[01:04:50] if you're a small business owner so by not confronting the dragon when it's like two inches high
[01:04:57] and can only you know it's like it can bell-chowed something like a bit lighter you wait till
[01:05:02] the thing can inflame the whole room and then you say oh my god like isn't this hellish it's like well
[01:05:07] you knew that there was something to say you knew it you knew it a thousand times and now
[01:05:14] you can't just say the one thing you have to say the thousand things or maybe you have to say the
[01:05:18] ten thousand things and it's just destructive in every way so yeah that's not good
[01:05:24] now here's where I need help with this so what I think people might get the ideas okay if
[01:05:31] I'm in a relationship with my wife and she gives serves me dry chicken again right which is
[01:05:38] a common theme in my house and actually thanks to the internet it's actually changed now
[01:05:43] because she's gotten thousands of people that haven't now sent her how to keep the chicken more
[01:05:47] so she does a great job but for for you know we're talking about two decades of my life we're
[01:05:52] talking about dry chicken this is a problem so and you know what I did I didn't say anything
[01:05:58] because I just would drink more water yeah more water at dinner yeah I fear that sometimes people
[01:06:04] say well you know what I'm gonna do so I'm just gonna run around it I'm gonna tell the truth to
[01:06:06] everyone all the time on these little things that don't matter now my my my actual best example
[01:06:12] that I've ever heard of this we we had a guy in the podcast named Charlie Plum he was a pilot in
[01:06:17] Vietnam he was shot down in and on his last mission of his deployment he was shot down he was captured
[01:06:25] using the honeyhilton for six years this is the deal that they had amongst their roommates so they
[01:06:32] had roommates and it's run smaller than we're in right now and there'd be four of them in there
[01:06:36] three of them and they're two from there depending on what's going on if you did something
[01:06:40] then normally if Jordan does something that annoys me we gotta live together if you do something
[01:06:45] that annoys me it's my fault it's my fault for allowing you clip clip click your nails together
[01:06:52] or you pick your nose a lot or you itch your head whatever it is that you do that bothers me
[01:06:56] it's my problem and I have to absorb it because otherwise what we have is we have like rats and
[01:07:03] a cage that are gonna knowledge other apart and I thought about that while I was reading the
[01:07:09] part of the book that was saying and you actually also later in the book talk about hey you know
[01:07:14] you're gonna get fight over this little stupid thing or you're gonna absorb and I talk about that
[01:07:18] a lot as a leader yeah as a as a person in a relationship hey there's problems from your boss
[01:07:24] you absorb them and you don't pass them down to your people you know you you want to stay
[01:07:29] work or stay late and do a much crazy stuff that we don't think we should be doing cool my
[01:07:32] guys are gonna go home I'm gonna absorb that I'll get it done myself I'm not gonna absorb these problems
[01:07:37] now are there some tertiary effects of course or secondary effects that know my boss thinks
[01:07:42] you can get away with that and all those things but I just think there's we have to be careful
[01:07:47] that we're not just throwing a lot of spears of truth in people's hands or whatever is
[01:07:53] a bunch of black truths they're the opposite of white lies right so black truths are truth
[01:07:57] you used to hurt other people with right so technically in the moment the statement is factual
[01:08:04] but the context be lies right whereas a white lie it's like well it's a little lie but you're
[01:08:09] trying to support a larger truth not that white white lies aren't optimal you know it's better
[01:08:14] not to lie but sometimes the best you can manage is a white lie and then maybe that's better
[01:08:19] pretty good well okay so then in those sorts of situations you think well first of all I have
[01:08:25] some rules of thumb if someone does something at work that annoys you it's like right it off man
[01:08:31] it's like that's once it's like what does that mean you're having a bad day or I'm having
[01:08:35] a bad day it's like doesn't mean anything do it twice think it's okay that's right that off
[01:08:42] right that off it's that's the same issue it could still just be circumstance in situation
[01:08:49] three times okay now there might be grounds for a conversation you go and say well you know
[01:08:54] you put your feet up on my desk like but they ago and that was okay but then you did it again
[01:09:00] and then like you did it again and I'm thinking it actually happened three times right so there's
[01:09:07] no denying it and perhaps that's not optimal and then you go for the smallest possible
[01:09:12] victory that's the next thing is like I'm not telling you that you're what would you say
[01:09:18] that you lack respect or that there's something wrong with you what I'm asking is that if you come
[01:09:24] in my office it would be better for both of us if your feet stayed on the floor that okay
[01:09:33] you know and and that's a small thing you're not going after the person's character right you're
[01:09:37] going after the tiny victory so you say to your wife look like I'm thrilled to death that you're
[01:09:42] cooking me dinner really I'm serious because and it could be a hell of lot worse than it is you know
[01:09:47] and and maybe I could be more helpful around the kitchen that's certainly a possibility
[01:09:53] but I have to go out this thing with regards to chicken and maybe it's me you know but could we
[01:09:58] try for like a month to cook it differently and then we'll revisit it and if I happen to be wrong
[01:10:04] like I'll shut the hell up and she might think okay well he is kind of useless around the
[01:10:08] kitchen and sort of bitchy about the chicken and all of that but maybe I trust him enough to admit
[01:10:15] that I made a small mistake and rectify it and we could go along and not have the damn chicken thing
[01:10:20] hanging over our heads till we're 80 you know you just in your second example there you I tell
[01:10:26] people it's all the time so you you're coming into my office and you're putting your feet in the
[01:10:30] desk what I'll generally do is make it my fault I generally say hey Jordan I hate to be like a
[01:10:36] nitpicker yeah but I'm really freaked out about germs it's really stupid but yeah and when you
[01:10:42] come and put your feet on my desk it freaks me out yeah you just do me a favor and not put your
[01:10:46] feet on your knees I was thinking of the same thing with you know with the chicken it's like hey
[01:10:50] you know what I have a super sensitive palate refined and I just do the rough minds just to
[01:10:55] refine for your story but and I just yeah could we maybe figure out another way to cook that
[01:11:01] or okay we try you know but I'll take the blame for for the situation rather than your
[01:11:09] your disrespect for don't put your feet on my desk this is you know well you don't want to
[01:11:12] adopt more of a position of moral superiority than is absolutely necessary one of the things I
[01:11:19] recommend I don't remember if I wrote it into all rules for life I think I did about how to
[01:11:24] let's say you're in an intractable argument with your wife about who's the most reprehensible
[01:11:29] person right which is where arguments sort of end when they go to hell I think now you're in
[01:11:35] one of those arguments and you risk bringing up the past which is a very very bad idea right
[01:11:40] maybe you're saying something like you've always been this way you're this way down you'll never
[01:11:45] change and none of it's good it's like oh man that's a fight because where where are you going to
[01:11:49] go from there so one of the things I recommend and this actually works is when you're in one of
[01:11:53] these battles and you can't bloody well get out of it you separate each go to your room and you
[01:11:57] sit and think okay that person is really wrong and I like to give them a good stomping and
[01:12:02] but then you think no I got to live with them so that's probably not a good idea right because I
[01:12:06] don't want to live with someone who's like stomped and angry about it because they're going to
[01:12:10] take their revenge like if they have any spirit at all so you cannot win an argument with your wife
[01:12:15] that's just wrong you can't you can make peace you can come up with a solution but if you win
[01:12:21] she loses and then she's the loser and like unless you want to have a loser around that's not
[01:12:28] a very good strategy anyway so you go to your room and you think okay fundamentally flawed as my
[01:12:34] wife is particularly in this particular circumstance there's probably something stupid
[01:12:39] idea in the relatively recent past that increased the probability that we're in this little
[01:12:45] hellish place and you think oh what was it and you think oh god I really don't want to know
[01:12:50] it's like I really don't want to know this and so you think no I'm going to figure out where I'm one
[01:12:56] percent at fault she's 99% wrong but I'm I'm 1% at fault so you sit there and you think okay what
[01:13:02] was it and you let your imagination sort of wander over your past stupidities and you think oh
[01:13:08] there is something I did that was like kind of underhanded and devious and crooked and pathetic and
[01:13:13] weasely and then you go and you tell her and she does the same thing you know and she's just
[01:13:19] irritated about it as you are and then you think okay and you say look I'm sorry about that and
[01:13:24] I know this increased the probability that we're in this like bitchy horrible place and she does the
[01:13:29] same thing and then you think oh yeah well we're both pathetic losers and we can quit plan
[01:13:33] like dominance hierarchy and then maybe you can have a conversation about how to make it better
[01:13:37] and that conversation should be bounded too it's like the chicken thing is a really good
[01:13:42] my my father-in-law who I really like used to come my wife told me this story he used to come
[01:13:48] home for lunch eh and his wife would feed him lunch and she always used little plates and it was
[01:13:54] like they'd been married for 30 years and one day he had this explosion at the table about the fact
[01:14:00] that he'd had to eat off these damn little plates for 30 years and you know it was much more of a
[01:14:07] large explosion than it had to be but it's these little things actually matter they actually
[01:14:12] matter they have to straighten them out because your life especially with your wife is composed of
[01:14:17] about 50 little things that you do every day and because you do them every day they're not little
[01:14:24] you can just do the arithmetic you know it's like maybe you don't like
[01:14:27] where your wife greets you when you come home it's like okay is that relevant is that important well
[01:14:33] let's say it takes 10 minutes because you're thinking about it and you're coming home and then there's
[01:14:37] the little aftermath of it's 10 minutes so it's like an hour a week it's four hours a month it's 50
[01:14:41] hours a year that's one work week it's 2% of your life it's like 2% of your life right so that's
[01:14:47] the math it's like if you got 50 of those things right your whole life would be right think is it
[01:14:53] worth fighting about just like yeah it's worth it because it's 2% of your life or which one percent
[01:14:58] even whatever and then you think okay well how should people greet themselves when they first
[01:15:04] come home it's like well maybe it's not quite like your dog greets you because your dog is like
[01:15:09] reprehensively happy to see that's just too much right little candle do that but maybe you want
[01:15:15] the person to not be watching TV for the second you enter the house maybe they should just stop
[01:15:21] watching TV and come and say you know hello how was your day and give you a hug that would be a
[01:15:25] good thing and then maybe you do the same thing to them and you practice that for like two months
[01:15:30] because you're both stupid and it's really hard for you to learn anything and then you've got that
[01:15:34] down and the dinner times are like that too like a lot and lots of households meal times are really
[01:15:39] fractured which is a bad thing or they're bitter it's like I'm here's your goddamn food it's like
[01:15:45] yeah I'll eat it but I can't stand it and you can't cook it's like okay that's four and a half hours
[01:15:50] a day right for your whole life you think you're gonna like someone like that not a bit man you know
[01:15:56] I'd do like them so you fix that you actually did tell that whole thing in the book so that's
[01:16:01] it's good is in there and actually the phrasing that you used when you say if you win an argument
[01:16:06] you said something along the lines of you win you win that argument they're the loser yeah
[01:16:11] now you win that argument a hundred times now in a marriage you win ten thousand times and you
[01:16:16] are now married to a loser and that loser that loser is not going to be someone who makes any effort
[01:16:23] whatsoever ever to be attractive to you or anyone else then you'll think oh look look look look
[01:16:30] who I ended up with it's like no look at how you produced it's like good work there it's guy and
[01:16:38] that's the so so what you're talking about with this argument thing and you look go but you
[01:16:43] separate you go in your room you say okay what did I do wrong yeah right I do wrong that's annoying
[01:16:47] what did I do wrong and and interestingly myself and my my my buddy life babbling we wrote a book
[01:16:53] called Extreme ownership and I mean whole premises you take responsibility for when things go wrong
[01:16:58] you say yeah this was my fault so I'll go to clients and I'll be meeting with them and I'll say
[01:17:04] you look when you something goes wrong with your team you're with me you guys made a mistake you fail
[01:17:07] up whatever you're trying to accomplish you know you gotta take ownership of you stand up and you
[01:17:11] say hey look this was my fault and this is what you know we're gonna do and then the people will
[01:17:17] say well you know what if I did that my team is so bad yeah that if I did that with my team you know
[01:17:22] what they'd say they'd say you're right it is your fault and and it looked at me like well
[01:17:28] the so you're plan jocco sucks yeah because if I say this is my fault my team is gonna look at
[01:17:33] me and say you're right it is your fault and then what do I do and I kind of get a little bit
[01:17:40] maybe a little bit frustrated because I look at them and I say that's the whole point it actually
[01:17:47] is your fault you're not just saying it to get out of the the problem you're not just saying it
[01:17:53] to make excuses for everything that's happening no when you say hey this is my fault that we
[01:17:57] got in this argument and then your and your wife says yeah it is you don't say no no no no no no you
[01:18:02] say I know and you have to mean it is you say I know and this is what I'm gonna do to fix it and
[01:18:09] if you're a leader you say it's my fault and your team says yeah you're right it is your fault you
[01:18:11] say I know that's what I just said and here's what I'm gonna do to fix it so when you take ownership
[01:18:16] of a problem it doesn't necessarily make the problem go away in fact it doesn't do that at all
[01:18:21] once you admit what the problem is and you take ownership of the problem then you have to say
[01:18:24] here's what I'm gonna do to fix it let's say your high school kid and you got a tyrant as a
[01:18:30] teacher it's like well you could it could be the case that you have a tyrant as a teacher and the
[01:18:34] tyrant is particularly on your case and you think well yeah that's an awful thing and this
[01:18:38] person really is a tyrant it's like yeah but you're not very good at dealing with tyrants
[01:18:43] you might think well I shouldn't have to be it's like fair enough man because who wants tyrants
[01:18:48] but truth of the matter is is that there is always tyranny and if you don't know how to deal with it
[01:18:55] if you don't know how to thrive in the face of tyranny even then there is something wrong with you
[01:19:01] now doesn't mean that there isn't something wrong with the tyrant it's like that's self-evident
[01:19:05] but it doesn't mean that you aren't who you could be because if you were everything you could be
[01:19:10] you could manage that situation and it might be you'd figure out an exit strategy I mean who the
[01:19:15] hell knows what the solution would be but if you if you're conceiving yourself as helpless
[01:19:21] victim then that's what you are and I'm not saying that there aren't situations that people find
[01:19:26] themselves in where there's very well it's hard to say you know that there's very little you can
[01:19:33] do I mean that woman that we talked about earlier she was in a pretty damn hopeless situation
[01:19:37] and she found something she could do you know and I've read these books Victor Frankles
[01:19:41] man search for meaning and social netizens go like archipelago I mean he saw people in some pretty
[01:19:46] damn dire straits like really you know really beyond comprehension and he noticed even in
[01:19:53] those situations that people still have their choices to make you know and I mean you you
[01:19:58] tread on that ground with extreme hesitancy because you don't say well man if I was thrown in the
[01:20:03] go like I would have been noble it's like no probably not man you would have been a trusty in about
[01:20:07] 15 minutes you know that's the most likely outcome so you have to be careful about not
[01:20:12] getting too high on your horse about such things but it isn't obvious when you're out of choices
[01:20:17] most of the time you have more choices you haven't used all the choices you have most of the time
[01:20:24] now I've seen people in situations I couldn't help them get out of so and people die right
[01:20:29] I mean you have a fatal illness you have pancreatic cancer like you're dead in six months your
[01:20:34] choices are limited but maybe under those circumstances you figure out how to put your house in order
[01:20:40] and be what you can to the people who will be left it's something like that from for me and I
[01:20:46] get a lot of and I know you get infinitely more than me but I'll get someone that reports to me
[01:20:51] a problem or a situation that they're in that seems really bad and and what I've found is
[01:20:57] the solution that they're looking for the only solution that they can conceive of is one that is
[01:21:04] going to provide that solution within a two week time frame like that's what we're talking about
[01:21:10] if I'm not this problem is installed in two weeks then you know this is hell and I always kind
[01:21:16] of report back and say hey you're here in a job right now that I understand it's bad I understand
[01:21:22] it's your boss's terrible the team is terrible whatever the case is what it or you're in a
[01:21:26] situation or your family is this or whatever so conceive of plan right now and it's not going to take
[01:21:32] two weeks it might take six months it might take a year it might take a year and a half of you
[01:21:36] saving your money and setting your resume and getting the service skills that you need if you can
[01:21:41] if you can extend your time and I'll tell you what when you when you come up with that plan when you
[01:21:46] conceive of that plan immediately you have hope and when you have hope you can continue on through
[01:21:54] the miserable existence that you're in because you know that you've got a plan and you're going to
[01:21:57] get your way out of it absolutely well I had a client recently because I've done a lot of consulting
[01:22:01] as well it's clinical work and often my clients come to me they're high functioning people they
[01:22:06] have decent jobs but you know we make a plan it's like well I'm making 75 thousand dollars a year
[01:22:12] right now the person says so well how much well okay we're going to we're going to prove that like
[01:22:16] why don't we see if we can triple that see if we can triple it it's like what the hell you know
[01:22:20] maybe we can't but maybe we can some people do make triple that could be you okay so what's wrong
[01:22:27] with you well you know you're not educated enough all right so we need to fix that your resume is
[01:22:32] in order you're not sending the damn thing out it's like well then you got to do baselines
[01:22:37] statistics it's like well how many times do you have to send out your resume to to move ahead
[01:22:41] when you're already in a pretty decent job well the answer isn't 10 the answer is like you have
[01:22:46] to send out five a day every day for the next two years and the the rejection rate will be so
[01:22:53] close to a hundred percent that that's what it will feel like right but it's a lottery ticket you
[01:22:59] only have to win once so it doesn't matter if you if you lose 300 times doesn't matter you just need
[01:23:06] one hit so now you got to prepare yourself because it's going to be brutal because you're sending
[01:23:10] out all these you know resumes to jobs you're not quite qualified enough for because you're looking
[01:23:17] to move up brace yourself right it's going to be nothing but failure nothing but failure well
[01:23:22] this particular client to think it took her two years maybe more two and a half years of sending
[01:23:29] out resumes and accelerating her education and and practicing because she'd get an interview now
[01:23:34] and then and get very close to it to get that first move right but then she got two more in the
[01:23:40] next year and she was out tripler salary but you know it's like long terms strategic thinking
[01:23:47] followed by an implementable plan and then the willingness to tolerate an insane run of
[01:23:53] ridiculous failures before you move but I've seen that happen to people there's no reason that you can't
[01:24:01] move you just have to figure out where you want to move you have to figure out what the criteria are
[01:24:06] for putting you in that position and then you have to be some measure of insanely persistent because
[01:24:12] it's so unlikely right that the default answer to the question can I have this good job is
[01:24:19] are you out of your mind of course not right well it is it's like an even if you're qualified it's
[01:24:25] like yeah you and ten other people so there's even an element of chance at it especially at the end
[01:24:31] you don't like if you're in the top five you've done everything you can can do to control that
[01:24:38] outcome there's some element of chance that's going to be the determining variable because you know
[01:24:44] maybe I don't know maybe they didn't like the way your suit looked on you and that's the only
[01:24:49] thing that's differentiating you from the other candidate it's like you also don't want to take
[01:24:53] that to personally it's like what you hit the top five you were shortlisted you're in there man
[01:24:57] you're in there you're in the gap do that ten times you'll win one of those contests but you
[01:25:02] got to do it ten times so and you know even if it's lower in jobs like I've worked in lots of
[01:25:09] lower in jobs we talked about dishwasher yeah yeah yeah well you know I was dishwasher for
[01:25:17] while but then I was a shorter to cook yeah and you know but more than that more importantly than that
[01:25:21] even while I was a dishwasher washer once I kind of got the hang of it which was a lot harder
[01:25:28] than you might think once I got the hang of it I was valued member of that team it's like
[01:25:35] while you're dishwasher it's like yeah that's one way of looking at it another way of looking
[01:25:39] at it's that I'm valued member of this team and that was actually fun like I was just a kid you know
[01:25:43] I was 14 and I was I did my job properly and I got treated like an adult it was like I loved that
[01:25:50] I loved that that was great and so the fact that I was well are you a dishwasher or you a
[01:25:54] 14 year old adult hey I'm a 14 year old adult hey I win I win that dishwasher no dishwasher
[01:26:01] it's like that's a good game and I really did like that I mean when I look back in my
[01:26:05] mid-adolescence it's certainly in the case that the the times that were the best for me when
[01:26:11] I was working in restaurants because I was I was part of the team man so
[01:26:18] you one of the sections in the book you talk about um I believe the person's name was lunchbox
[01:26:25] lunch bucket lunch bucket right for a little bit you know since we're talking about
[01:26:30] work environments and there's that certain level of camaraderie you actually talk about the
[01:26:35] seal teams in here where you just have this it's like a non and I've talked about this before
[01:26:40] in the seal teams it's non stop hyper verbal abuse aggression around the clock 24 hours
[01:26:49] day you're in a seal pool tune like that's the life any any mistake that you make any any
[01:26:56] display of weakness is gonna be especially contaminated we rip apart always gonna be ripped apart
[01:27:04] and then if you get all your tated about that it's even worse then you're just dead the nicknames
[01:27:08] you talked about lunch bucket your nickname was how do you how do you do the nicknames
[01:27:13] or the how do you which was which was pretty good about it yeah I'm from how do you do
[01:27:17] which is kind of so good how do you which is kind of cool right is western yeah but but
[01:27:23] the nicknames that that are in the seal teams like I can't with good conscience repeat them
[01:27:28] sure that they're just they're just horrible names but there's a camaraderie around that
[01:27:34] and there's also the way as I was reading what you'd written about these guys working on rail
[01:27:39] rate where are we crew yeah there's a test it's a test it's a test to see where you're at
[01:27:45] it's right you made up can we rely on you can you can you can you can you tolerate a little bit of
[01:27:49] irritation the answer that is no it's like well maybe we don't want you around then because
[01:27:53] some irritating things are likely to come down the pipe yeah and it's it's not just um
[01:27:59] to me to me it proves if you've got someone that can take it right it's not just that they can take
[01:28:04] some random joking insults like they can they can take it they can take it yeah that's
[01:28:09] what you're testing for it's like can you take it lunch pocket couldn't right because people
[01:28:13] would laugh at his lunch pocket and he'd get all upset it's like well you have a stupid lunch
[01:28:17] pocket it's like you know your mum packed it how about it you laugh at yourself yeah my mum packed
[01:28:22] this I know it's kind of stupid that would be the end of it he would just have to say that
[01:28:25] it's like but I didn't want to hurt her feelings it's like oh okay you know fine you got your
[01:28:30] stupid lunch pocket but no he couldn't handle that you know so yeah it was it was horrible
[01:28:35] had comical to watch at the same time because the level of and people have written me about that
[01:28:39] and they said oh you know poor lunch pocket it's like because they're all compassion I think no
[01:28:43] no not poor lunch pocket it's like clue the hell in buddy you had your chance you know that was a
[01:28:48] desirable job that real crew job in the summer because it was high paying you know and they weren't
[01:28:53] easy to come by those jobs and so the fact that he got hired onto that crew is a real opportunity
[01:28:57] for him you could make a pile of money in the summer out working on the rail crew and all you had to do is
[01:29:04] take some ribbing with good grace not suck up to the management too badly and not have other
[01:29:11] people do your job that was all that was all you had to do but he couldn't do that and so he got
[01:29:16] run off and it was like grow the hell up buddy you know these guys when 100 people are teasing you
[01:29:22] then probably they're not wrong yeah when you are getting tease like that as well
[01:29:33] well when you when you when you stop reacting it's no longer fun yeah yeah yeah well also gives you an
[01:29:40] opportunity to tease back it's like yeah you can show your wit and one of the things that working
[01:29:44] class guys in particular which is what one of the things I really loved about working class jobs is that
[01:29:48] they're always looking for some humor so it's like if if person A is teasing person B that's kind
[01:29:53] of comical but if person B comes back with a good time back it's like not even better you know so
[01:30:00] I think that's a lot of how those jobs are rendered tolerable right it's their their hard
[01:30:04] dirty jobs dishwasher's a good example that's not dangerous although cooking is you know you
[01:30:10] gotta watch your step I got burned a lot when I was cooking but what makes those jobs not only
[01:30:17] tolerable but even desirable is that you can develop a tremendous amount of camaraderie around them
[01:30:22] I've never really experienced that at a professional level job that just doesn't happen the same way
[01:30:27] and it's really there's a real loss in that so it's it's it's it's fun to be part of a team that's doing
[01:30:34] you know grubby hands on things and and having a ridiculously entertaining vicious
[01:30:42] cruel and evil time while you're doing it that's very entertaining the this new kids book I wrote so
[01:30:48] uh the kid mark he's getting made fun of by this he's a different kind of bully he's like a mental
[01:30:53] bully that that verbally abuses people and he gets called plate face by this character and to
[01:31:02] it eventually gets in trouble for throwing a something at the kid because he's calling him plate face
[01:31:05] plate but eventually way he befriends the kid is by he they have to do a self portrait class he draws a picture of
[01:31:11] himself looking like a plate and he shows the kid the kid laughs and all of a sudden their buddies and it's like
[01:31:16] that's what you do you take away that you take away the joy of of being so heated and irritated by
[01:31:24] people that are making fun of you and you just kill it right there too jutsu and some sense well
[01:31:28] I had an experience with that about three years ago I'd put my videos up online and people kept saying
[01:31:34] that I sounded like kermit well one person said it and I thought well whatever but then like five
[01:31:40] people said it and I thought oh my god like this kermit thing so then I went and listened to kermit
[01:31:45] and I thought oh no it's like it's like really I really sound like kermit you know and so then
[01:31:51] well then I started to play with it a little bit you know I used the puppet when I when I
[01:31:56] when I went to speak to university students and I made frog jokes and then I made a video
[01:32:01] that sort of featured me as a frog and it's crazy right it's ridiculous but but that's and but
[01:32:07] but the teasing never got mean because of that you know and the same things happened online
[01:32:12] to a larger degree as people keep making memes of me like and there's I don't know there's lots of them
[01:32:17] there's way too many to even keep track of and I was watching that happen and I thought okay this is a
[01:32:22] good thing because there's humor and wherever there's humor that's a good thing and they're making
[01:32:26] fun of me but it's gentle you know most of it was poki you know like well you sound like this
[01:32:31] damn puppet what do you think about it's like well if I had to pick someone to sound like
[01:32:35] probably wouldn't be a puppet but it had to be a puppet kermit's not a bad one it could be a lot
[01:32:39] worse it could be mispaggy yeah it could be not you know so thank god that didn't happen but the
[01:32:44] memes have never got vicious because you know I'll post them if they're funny and satirical and
[01:32:51] then they won't get vicious because they don't have to it's like can we poke fun of at you it's like
[01:32:55] yeah please do and the more the better really because that'll also help keep my feet on the ground
[01:33:00] and keep me awake and plus it's funny and like one of the things about life is that
[01:33:05] a sense of humor that's a good thing to to arm yourself with because sometimes you just don't have
[01:33:11] anything other than that like my daughter when she recounts her the horrors of her adolescent she
[01:33:17] she had to have her hip and her ankle replaced because they both deteriorated beyond repair
[01:33:22] beyond the possibility of repair and she was like an agony for literally for years it was just awful
[01:33:28] she can tell that story in a way that will just make you die of laughter and it's like well thank
[01:33:34] God for that because what else do you have in a situation like that man if you if and sometimes it's
[01:33:39] so dark that your sense of humor is just about gone and then you're in real trouble but lots of times
[01:33:44] that's what you've got against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune it's like
[01:33:48] you see this with people especially people who've been through really hard times and they're
[01:33:53] witty like things will be bleak bleak bleak and they'll crack a joke and you think well thank God man
[01:33:58] you can pop up above that and see above it a bit and and like you know tap it with a bit of irony
[01:34:05] and thank God for that so when the comedians start to get silence there's real trouble and
[01:34:09] that's been happening to some degree in Canada you know comedians are increasingly not willing to go
[01:34:14] speak on university campuses and that's when the comedians can't talk that's a really bad
[01:34:20] sight because that's the that comedy that's the triumph of the human spirit over adversity right
[01:34:26] that's why guys in these horrible jobs are often so unbelievably funny it's like well what else do
[01:34:32] they have you know and and actually that's a lot to be funny like that to that can that can
[01:34:38] move you through a lot of dismal so you know I I'm paying attention to time because I know in
[01:34:44] case someone can't tell that we're by an airport right now but to kind of bring this a little bit
[01:34:49] too close first of all we didn't cover anything that I wanted to cover today so we should all
[01:34:52] know that so you're coming back to do that with my talks like oh that's not the talk I plan
[01:34:57] well yeah your first biblical talk you covered the first line of Genesis right you made it one line
[01:35:02] deep and done half hours well done well done yeah but one of the things and I think it's a good
[01:35:08] note to end on at least a little bit to touch on because you're kind of talking about it right now
[01:35:13] is you know the last rule is to to pet a cat when you encounter one on the street yeah
[01:35:18] it's basically find a little bit of joy in these common things well it's a it's a chapter
[01:35:25] about about my daughter's experience and like it was a brutal man it was brutal she was literally
[01:35:31] walking around on two broken legs for two years and she had to take incredibly high doses of
[01:35:36] opiates and so had all the problems that went along with that she had to take riddle into stay awake
[01:35:41] it's like and she was in all likelihood she was dying there's a bunch of reasons for that and
[01:35:46] and those were just some of her health problems those were those weren't even the worst ones
[01:35:51] strangely enough so it was bloody brutal man and one of the things we told her and we managed this
[01:35:57] thank god as I told her once the disease started to develop she had rheumatoid arthritis very
[01:36:02] very seriously I said to her when she was a little kid said look kid this is gonna be rough man
[01:36:08] this is gonna be rough and and here's what you could do to make it worse it's like use your illness
[01:36:13] as an excuse you do that at your peril you do that a hundred times you will not be able to tell
[01:36:18] the difference between suffering that stops you from moving forward and an excuse for not
[01:36:23] living and you will be done it's never never never use your illness as an excuse like if you can't
[01:36:30] do it you can't do it you know we had a good experience without it's written in the book when
[01:36:37] we bought her a scooter because she couldn't use public transportation and we were all freaked out
[01:36:42] about that because like well she has damaged bones and you know broken hip and all of this is like
[01:36:46] you're gonna buy that kid a scooter really it's like well what are you gonna do keep her in her bedroom
[01:36:52] you want to think that's a good idea tell her she can't go out in the world it's like have the
[01:36:57] damn scooter so after awhile she had to get licensed for it there's a licensing procedure and
[01:37:02] to do that she actually had to write a motorbike and so she trained to write the motorbike
[01:37:06] like not very long after she had her hip replaced I think it was a six week something like
[01:37:11] that so of course we're all freaked out about that too because it's like oh man she has to
[01:37:15] write a motorbike and she has this hip and it's like what are we gonna do and she went and she
[01:37:20] did the motorcycle last first one but she dropped the bike a couple of times and some kid wiped out
[01:37:25] and rolled like 30 feet and that kind of freaked her out unsurprisingly and and so then the second
[01:37:31] day she went with her mom to do the motorcycle training she also got trained to write a motor
[01:37:35] motorcycle and the second day she woke up and she said I don't think I can do this and we thought
[01:37:41] well you know that's understandable it's like I can understand that and we talked through it we
[01:37:47] said look here's what to do man is like yeah you can't do it we understand why you're afraid of it
[01:37:52] you can't hold the bike up that well but why don't you just go like go in the car with your mom
[01:38:00] and see how you feel when you get there because you get close and you get right up to it
[01:38:05] maybe you can say no and you have to sit in the car and like that's life and we get it but
[01:38:10] maybe you don't have to and she went there so she thought that was okay and she went there
[01:38:14] and she picked up the damn motorbike and got her license and everybody cheered at the end and
[01:38:19] then she could drive her goddamn scooter around and thank God for that because you know she used
[01:38:24] to go out there and she put on her helmet and she'd go on her scooter and she was like ready to go
[01:38:28] out the world and so that's like that's the difference between making your kids safe and making them
[01:38:34] strong and it was touching bloody go you know because it could have easily been that she would have
[01:38:38] been in the little accident with her motorcycle and broken her leg and then we would have
[01:38:41] thought oh what kind of horrible parents are we she's already got problems and we put her on a
[01:38:45] damn scooter in the middle of the city it's like well you're going to be competent or you're
[01:38:51] going to be safe it's like there's nothing safer than competence and so and it was great for
[01:38:57] because it was just one more active courage you know and and she loved that damn scooter she had it
[01:39:02] for like six years and it was a really good idea risky as hell but really a good idea so yep
[01:39:09] well yeah again I'm looking at the clock we got to get you out of here first of all 12 rules for
[01:39:17] life and and it don't to chaos that's out right now it's number one on Amazon in America UK Canada
[01:39:28] everywhere that's pretty awesome I'm I'm yeah struck wordless by it yeah yeah
[01:39:36] everyone should just get it and because we didn't talk about anything I wanted to talk about today
[01:39:44] you come back we'll do this book and everyone likes to read the books if I keep they can before
[01:39:49] I do the podcast on them so to give everyone a chance to read it which would be awesome
[01:39:53] any other things well I should say I've got this online program called self-authoring
[01:39:59] and I'm offering your viewers a enlistner's a 20% discount that helps you write out an autobiography
[01:40:05] so you can figure out like what you haven't sorted out about your life it helps you write an
[01:40:10] analysis of your virtues in fault so you can rectify the faults and capitalize on the virtues
[01:40:15] and helps you make a plan for the future and I would say to your listeners don't be afraid to
[01:40:21] do it badly because a bad plan a bad account for yourself and a bad plan is way better than
[01:40:28] no account for yourself and no plan it's way better so do it do it badly it'll it'll help
[01:40:34] orient you in your life and we have a preponderance of of scientific data showing for example
[01:40:43] that people who've done the future authoring portion of this that's the plan are like 30% more
[01:40:48] likely to stay in university has an overwhelming effect and it works best on people who are doing
[01:40:53] worst which is really quite cool so there's that I have a personality test at understand myself
[01:41:00] calm and you can go there and get an analysis of 10 aspects of your personality it's kind of a harsh
[01:41:06] test like it'll tell you actually what you're like and it'll probably make you angry you know
[01:41:11] because maybe not but it probably will but it'll tell you it'll help you figure out what jobs you
[01:41:17] might be suited for but it'll also tell you where your week and could be stronger and so that's
[01:41:22] better medicine but but it's better to know it's better to know because then you can do something
[01:41:28] about it so I would say those are two useful things and I'd encourage people to they're inexpensive
[01:41:36] give them a try they'll they're helpful and on top of that you've got your podcast you've got your
[01:41:43] YouTube channel which has hundreds of hours worth of lectures and is fantastic Jordan Petersen
[01:41:52] dot com as well and well I just want to thank you for coming on the podcast again but more
[01:41:59] important I want to thank you for continuing to do what you do I know it's hard work and I know it's
[01:42:05] taxing on you and on your family life and all that yeah it beats suffering stupidly it does
[01:42:11] need and I know for a fact that you're having incredibly positive impact all over the world
[01:42:17] getting people everywhere to try to and to grow the hell out to grow up to grow up to speed up the
[01:42:24] truth make themselves and make thereby the world better place it could be a better place that would be
[01:42:33] good if we could manage that yeah indeed all right thanks for coming on you bet well we have excused
[01:42:41] Dr Jordan Peterson from the this is a recording studio no we're in a rented office make shift
[01:42:48] make shift Jordan had to go catch a plane and continue to get out there and make the world a
[01:42:56] better place good for him yes good for us and echo speaking of making the world a better place sure
[01:43:02] maybe you can let us know how we might be able to make our world a little bit better sure of course
[01:43:12] yeah first thing we can do is stay on the path oh and part of staying on the path is maintaining
[01:43:21] our physical capability and competent competency competency is it competence or competency competency
[01:43:31] we're gonna maintain that that's what we're gonna do on the path so we had jocquests of
[01:43:38] limits obviously we already know if you don't know krill oil joint warfare so jocquest super krill oil
[01:43:45] that's a krill oil supplement so joint where warfare is the glucosamine conjurting and
[01:43:51] curcumin yes very good things for your joints we you know at some point we'll go through
[01:43:58] everything that's in there not today yeah I do something so that because I don't want to
[01:44:04] turn talk about but it's good yeah it's good use it yeah you see the and it's not the kind where
[01:44:12] it's good because it's generally healthy to take these things which it is but that's not the the main
[01:44:19] push in my opinion check the main thing is that if your joints are kind of kind of off jacks or
[01:44:29] do you do you do a lot do anything but if you if you do brick laying what does that Mason
[01:44:38] Mason if you're yeah like just from you know back elbows and then you start taking this you'll see
[01:44:46] that you'll feel that different you know specifically yeah and it's generally healthy anyway
[01:44:52] maintain the joints maintain the competency of your joints with jockel super krill joint warfare
[01:45:00] take them every day that's what I do in the routine also discipline pre workout it's a pre workout for
[01:45:06] me it's it's a pre mission for me it's a pre mission free trade up pre motion cognitive
[01:45:11] yeah and answer yeah and I'll tell you the only downfall of it right now well there's a couple
[01:45:17] number one it tastes delicious so you want to drink a lot of it number two the other day I drink
[01:45:22] oh a lot of it I'm gonna have to go and give a speech yeah I had to use the restroom right before
[01:45:29] I went on stage of general like yeah it's be careful well that's a general thing I know I like
[01:45:33] it doesn't have to be jockel discipline yeah you can do that with water careful yeah yeah you
[01:45:38] want to be careful but think you eat some of it like oh can we eat that eight some of it today it's
[01:45:43] see I'll try to avoid that yeah yeah yeah see so I like to took a mouth a little scoop yeah
[01:45:48] and it's not too bad in fact you know what you know you get like a shot of some really nasty alcohol
[01:45:56] keep it sure but it gives you like a little yeah sure guys you look at some of that yeah
[01:46:02] when you take just when you eat the straight powder sure which I'm now doing apparently
[01:46:06] it's gives you a little bit it gives you a little not only you get the effects of what's
[01:46:11] it but you get a little bit of a the main line yeah yeah that's kind of like when you're
[01:46:16] kid you buy the little cool lady you know when you be for you make the cool lady you get like a
[01:46:20] little you try that stuff straight yeah yeah it's like only it's not quite as horrible is that
[01:46:27] better than that it's better than cool lady no oh yeah definitely better than cool
[01:46:30] good jockel made a taste good he's into the taste good stuff anyway it's called
[01:46:34] did joc this it's called discipline called this yeah you'll see it anyway get at origin main
[01:46:40] dot com and also at origin main dot com you get you that's where you can get your ghee
[01:46:48] so you don't have to well you can still ask me what ghee get no don't ask anymore not
[01:46:53] not ask good I'll tell you I'll tell you and this is what I'll tell you good origin pick a
[01:46:57] ghee from there whichever when you want plenty of color not plenty of colors but the legit color
[01:47:01] you I have white I have one blue ghee that I never use all I have is white I have a black
[01:47:09] ghee someone gave me a black ghee and this is cool but I've never used it but
[01:47:14] because a lot of people ask me that too what color should I get yeah what color should you get
[01:47:18] I am very traditional and I use the white ghee but I do have a deaf ghee that's black
[01:47:24] black yes he's super dope but some schools they don't even allow other colors than white
[01:47:28] and blue yeah that's true but Pete says black is the is the number one seller okay like if
[01:47:36] just all colors black now can you compete iBJJF with a black ghee I don't know I forget but
[01:47:43] here's what we were talking about when you're a little kid and you think about martial arts what
[01:47:48] do you want to be the ninja you want to be an ninja yeah so now you got a 36 year old guy or a 28 year
[01:47:55] old guy and he finally he's feeling kind of ninja yes yeah what is he doing the legit too yeah
[01:48:02] then he's take that one extra step and he's got a black ghee boom ninja yeah in a matter of
[01:48:07] speaking yeah and I actually felt that that's part of the reason why I don't get a black ghee because
[01:48:12] I I kind of wanted like not like there's all Charles Bronson movie feathers what do you mean
[01:48:17] on old Charles Bronson movie called the mechanic yeah yeah there's a there's a there's a scene
[01:48:23] where their traditional karate guy is gonna fight a guy that's got some new tricks up his sleeve
[01:48:29] sure and the traditional karate guy has to get nuts on him yeah but these are just a plain white
[01:48:36] ghee yeah yeah yeah that's the tradition and Charles Bronson too yeah so I'm just you know
[01:48:41] yeah and in the line strangely I mainly stick to white because it's kind of that's the main like
[01:48:47] I'm not doing too much with the with the cool black one because the black one like I
[01:48:53] said about being ninja and it looks cool bright does it's really cool and but I didn't want to
[01:48:58] roll in and be like and they think oh what if you carry the girl cool with your black ghee kind of
[01:49:03] think you know the thing is I think it's progressed beyond that it's totally honest it's beyond that
[01:49:09] yeah you're not you're not standing out at all you have a black ghee now you might be if you go to
[01:49:16] a traditional you know school that has only white ghee yeah you're gonna stand out you come in
[01:49:20] and victory MMA in fitness you could be wearing a purple ghee no one's gonna care yeah I
[01:49:23] won't even look into your second camouflage yeah no one cares they might be like dang that's a
[01:49:26] cool camouflage ghee they might say that they might just put choke hold on you and get after it yeah
[01:49:33] so there it is I would say okay if they're saying hey jocco echo what ghee should I get what
[01:49:40] color should I get we know origin what color should I get a ask your school first yeah because
[01:49:45] some they don't allow you're gonna buy your cool black ghee or there's like army greener is there army greener
[01:49:52] you're gonna buy and they looked up and you're solid you're ready to go and you come in they
[01:49:55] see you can't train with that you can't have that some ask your school first if they allow all colors
[01:50:01] then that ones up to you yeah yeah but but the the point is with asking what color is that I think I
[01:50:08] think that they're like hey is there like a violation if I get this cool black one and you answer
[01:50:13] to it yeah now no unless your school does literally no factor literally no factor yeah
[01:50:20] so they got a you know an origin mean dot com that's where you get them also on it dot com slash jocco
[01:50:27] this is where I get the kettlebells the dope kettlebells you didn't talk about rash rash guards
[01:50:35] oh and origin yeah yeah and because the reason that I popped into my mind because they have spats now
[01:50:41] because they have spats now the first runa spats are green and like some other color yeah yellow
[01:50:49] line green yeah right you just didn't you don't worry I sent p to text now I'm not a got spats
[01:50:56] wearing dude I'm not wearing tights not happening just nothing against people that do there's some
[01:51:00] crazy due to two guys out there that are wearing tights like you read about yeah but I said I said
[01:51:07] AP not wearing tights yeah I know a lot of people that do make some black ones or something else
[01:51:14] yeah and he said got it yeah you can get obviously the rash guards are good to go yeah but now you
[01:51:21] can also get spats that are not so we're sticking with spats we're seeing what spats when we
[01:51:27] figured out the root of spats right or dope yeah it's a good thing yeah it's not it's I thought it
[01:51:32] would root back to you know some yeah some ballerina thing no it's a war yeah it's what you
[01:51:39] worn your legs when you're a cow for women yeah so we can say spats it's been approved yeah
[01:51:44] full of stuff yeah it's the same thing yeah it's you you take your shoe and your so we're good
[01:51:48] ankle yeah fully interesting color choice yeah the first one here's the thing though
[01:51:53] yeah about the spats yeah some colors you don't see like like if I was like hey I'm
[01:52:01] gonna wear this lime green and yellow thing whatever shirt spats whatever and you'd be like
[01:52:06] lime green yellow that just doesn't even sound good I'm looking at these two colors I don't think
[01:52:10] that's gonna look good but then you put it on a shirt or spats or something and then you put it on
[01:52:14] you're like oh dang that kind of works for some reason I'm not saying lime green and yellow does that
[01:52:18] I'm just saying certain color yeah combination here's the interesting thing peats my bro right
[01:52:23] sure me yeah literally with the first time I had a Skype conversation with Pete my wife is like
[01:52:31] it sounded like you were talking to yourself right because we and we know there's a four hour conversation
[01:52:35] by the way dang real now with that that being said I wouldn't have made spats that look like
[01:52:42] the first spats to be it come out with a million years now here's now here's the funny thing
[01:52:46] okay I can't even say I can't even say hey Pete don't you know no one's gonna like those you
[01:52:52] know why because my sense of fashion yeah is so off my sense of fashion is not exist yeah with
[01:52:59] it's literally not exist it would be not exist if you even had one yeah okay that's right well
[01:53:04] no it's not exist if you had one it would get it it's like double none okay yeah well so
[01:53:10] that's why I can't even say hey Pete I can't say I can't make a blanket saving like Pete
[01:53:15] people won't like those yeah I can't even say that because I have no idea so I just said what I do
[01:53:21] know is people would definitely like some black ones right yeah that's pretty safe to say so yeah
[01:53:28] yeah I don't mind the greener by the way but there you go no you even we've had this stuff we've
[01:53:34] had issues like this yes where you make things that I just don't yeah I'm not I'm the other
[01:53:38] on approved yeah on approved cross the board yeah but I just know you just kind of just don't know
[01:53:42] yeah I say okay you know I don't know that's I gotta stay humble over here yeah I can't claim to
[01:53:48] claim to have any any footing to stand on at all when it comes to fashion but that's any kind
[01:53:56] yeah and haircuts I'm pretty good with those you know what yeah sure if you had okay next question
[01:54:04] so yeah again origiming.com there's a lot of cool stuff on there's hoodie and stuff too by the way
[01:54:09] yeah which and this is a this is a buy it not biased what you call subjective
[01:54:16] when I was wearing the full origin sweat suit I don't I lay down on the couch just took a
[01:54:24] break whatever no I don't normally do that to break from what cruising you know you know
[01:54:30] doing whatever it is I was doing took a break lay down on the couch full sweat suit on origin
[01:54:35] it was the most comfortable moment I had in recent memory and just so everyone knows if you're talking
[01:54:42] about echoes comfort levels they're already you know comfort I know about it very familiar with it
[01:54:52] and yeah it was not saying a lot so yeah there it is okay back to on it the kettlebells that I get
[01:54:58] whole set up so I'm a set primal bills zombie bills legend bills they're the kettle bills
[01:55:09] that's where you get them on it.com slash jockel also they got some cool maces on there
[01:55:14] jockel is the mace right I do yeah but yeah one pounder you think 20 pounds is not heavy yeah
[01:55:22] it's heavy yeah it's really heavy that's one of those things and we kind of talked about it before
[01:55:26] where you wait like wait like this many pounds or you know kilos whatever it's not
[01:55:34] created equal like if it's shaped in a certain form yeah or formless or whatever that's way different
[01:55:41] yeah like my daughter I think I forget how much you've been weighs now like 53 pounds or something like
[01:55:47] that you think the puns is nothing this far as lifting this for you lift it yeah try lift
[01:55:51] 31 she don't want to be lifted right she's like she's a good piece like 150 pounds nonetheless

[01:59:38] actually they say that this is the u and i and i and where the same thing every day for the same
[01:59:42] reason yeah because you're decision making you know resources yeah i don't really believe all that
[01:59:49] i just believe i don't feel like sitting around thinking about what i'm gonna wear in the morning

[02:03:36] sore like you were gonna do squats today but you did a bunch of parapise yesterday so you're
[02:03:43] going back in your quads they're kind of sore so you're like maybe I'll just do it tomorrow no
[02:03:50] so all you gotta do it's like put in psychological warfare listen to isn't there's a track for
[02:03:57] that inhale it'll just explain just in his own little jockel way explain why you shouldn't do that
