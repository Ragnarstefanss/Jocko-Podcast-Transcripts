00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16 This is Jocco podcast number 90.
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:07.40 With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.80 Good evening, I go.
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:09.80 Good evening.
00:00:09.80 --> 00:00:22.16 As my wife Tori mentioned, this past week has been one of the most challenging of my life.
00:00:22.16 --> 00:00:26.48 I want to say thanks to my friends and family for your support.
00:00:26.48 --> 00:00:32.08 You really have no idea how a much a few words of encouragement can mean when you are
00:00:32.08 --> 00:00:35.36 at a time in place like this.
00:00:35.36 --> 00:00:38.64 Thanks again.
00:00:38.64 --> 00:00:44.000 My platoon is in a very active area of operations in southern Afghanistan.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.88 Our mission is to close with and destroy the enemy.
00:00:47.88 --> 00:00:54.60 There is no outside the wire here because there is no wire.
00:00:54.60 --> 00:00:59.000 My boys are simply always on alert.
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.84 We haven't had a shower since we've been in Afghanistan.
00:01:02.84 --> 00:01:08.76 We've run nonstop missions and have been very successful at accomplishing these without
00:01:08.76 --> 00:01:14.12 experiencing any injuries to our own.
00:01:14.12 --> 00:01:19.12 I'm just trying to paint a picture of life here and not trying to make you feel sorry for
00:01:19.12 --> 00:01:21.96 us.
00:01:21.96 --> 00:01:30.000 Trust me, I belong here with these guys and we are a family.
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.52 Rather, I want to paint a picture because I'd like to tell you about Travis Mills.
00:01:36.52 --> 00:01:44.20 I know you don't know him, but it would mean a lot to me to be able to spread his story.
00:01:44.20 --> 00:01:49.96 My platoon's string of missions without injury came to an abrupt and violent end last week
00:01:49.96 --> 00:01:55.96 when we had dismounted ID during combat operations.
00:01:55.96 --> 00:02:00.12 I had three paratroopers injured from the blast.
00:02:00.12 --> 00:02:10.56 One was minor, one was severe, and one was simply beyond words.
00:02:10.56 --> 00:02:19.16 The most severe injury was sustained by my weapon squad leader, Travis Big Mills.
00:02:19.16 --> 00:02:23.32 I'd like to take the opportunity to tell you about him.
00:02:23.32 --> 00:02:28.68 Even under the conditions that I've described, he is the best of us.
00:02:28.68 --> 00:02:33.96 He was the biggest guy in the platoon and has the biggest heart to go with it.
00:02:33.96 --> 00:02:38.16 He was eager to please and always cheer this up.
00:02:38.16 --> 00:02:42.88 He led from the front and was injured because of it.
00:02:42.88 --> 00:02:49.76 He preferred that he take the injury over any man in his squad.
00:02:49.76 --> 00:02:56.48 He was the most fearless person I have ever seen in combat.
00:02:56.48 --> 00:03:00.92 When we weren't in combat, he was great to have around.
00:03:00.92 --> 00:03:05.48 He woke up every morning and sang a bunch of different songs to us.
00:03:05.48 --> 00:03:12.36 Usually Kasia or Britney Spears were the songs of some other girl band.
00:03:12.36 --> 00:03:13.88 We had this ritual.
00:03:13.88 --> 00:03:17.76 Anytime we finished a patrol where we had a fire fight, once we returned to the strong
00:03:17.76 --> 00:03:24.44 point, he'd run to the front of the formation and sing songs about the 82nd Airborne.
00:03:24.44 --> 00:03:27.96 He would do dance gestures and all.
00:03:27.96 --> 00:03:32.36 He even did it for the brigade commander when he came to visit.
00:03:32.36 --> 00:03:35.80 It was a big hit.
00:03:35.80 --> 00:03:42.04 I laughed at how or he laughed at how serious I am and how I don't like to be touched.
00:03:42.04 --> 00:03:47.76 So, he made it his personal mission to make me laugh.
00:03:47.76 --> 00:03:53.32 Usually this involved an overly aggressive and a little too intimate manhug followed
00:03:53.32 --> 00:03:59.28 by a middle school style dance where he'd grind on me.
00:03:59.28 --> 00:04:02.12 He kept me sane.
00:04:02.12 --> 00:04:05.48 I laughed at his antics constantly.
00:04:05.48 --> 00:04:11.36 In combat, there is no one we would rather have been with.
00:04:11.36 --> 00:04:15.48 He risked his life to save others constantly and I can recall two times specifically
00:04:15.48 --> 00:04:20.36 where he literally saved me.
00:04:20.36 --> 00:04:25.20 Needless to say, I took his injury hard, including the personal guilt that'll be
00:04:25.20 --> 00:04:29.36 your feels when he is responsible for his men.
00:04:29.36 --> 00:04:34.64 So I wanted to tell you these things.
00:04:34.64 --> 00:04:37.60 Everyone is asking how I'm doing.
00:04:37.60 --> 00:04:41.04 Yes, I am hurting.
00:04:41.04 --> 00:04:44.48 But you know I'm going to be okay.
00:04:44.48 --> 00:04:49.56 More importantly, Travis is going to be okay.
00:04:49.56 --> 00:04:53.80 The truth is, obviously things here are so terrible that I'll never be able to put them
00:04:53.80 --> 00:04:54.80 into words.
00:04:54.80 --> 00:05:00.32 Travis is injury being at the top of the list.
00:05:00.32 --> 00:05:04.84 But I've also seen things here so wonderful that I'll never be able to put them into words
00:05:04.84 --> 00:05:07.04 either.
00:05:07.04 --> 00:05:11.76 I know that sounds crazy, but it's true.
00:05:11.76 --> 00:05:15.56 How do you put into words this spirit like the one I've just described in big
00:05:15.56 --> 00:05:19.44 mills?
00:05:19.44 --> 00:05:25.60 The reality of it is that I have the honor of leading people like Travis.
00:05:25.60 --> 00:05:31.12 There are many more in my platoon just like him.
00:05:31.12 --> 00:05:35.96 So while I've seen some things I'd like to never talk about again.
00:05:35.96 --> 00:05:40.16 I've seen just as many that I'll spend the rest of my life trying to explain to anyone who
00:05:40.16 --> 00:05:43.96 will listen.
00:05:43.96 --> 00:05:52.12 I've seen a tremendous love and care between brothers that have only each other to rely on
00:05:52.12 --> 00:06:00.36 and have only one care to bring each other home.
00:06:00.36 --> 00:06:05.92 It's a selfless, deep, everlasting bond that I consider myself lucky and absolutely
00:06:05.92 --> 00:06:11.20 privileged to be a part of.
00:06:11.20 --> 00:06:17.88 Thank you so much again for your support, but know that I am fine.
00:06:17.88 --> 00:06:22.36 I am exactly where I need to be right now.
00:06:22.36 --> 00:06:36.04 My family here is taking care of each other and we will persevere as one.
00:06:36.04 --> 00:06:48.48 Now that is a letter that was written to friends and family at home from Lieutenant Zach
00:06:48.48 --> 00:06:59.30 Lewis, commander of 1st platoon, Bravo Troop, 4703 Cavalry Squadron, 4th Brigade Combat
00:06:59.30 --> 00:07:09.76 to the team of the 82nd Airborne Division, the All-Americans.
00:07:09.76 --> 00:07:19.64 I think that letter describes staff sergeant Travis Mills as only a fellow platoon member
00:07:19.64 --> 00:07:23.36 could.
00:07:23.36 --> 00:07:39.32 Explaining his unbelievably positive attitude is courage under fire and is unwavering leadership.
00:07:39.32 --> 00:07:49.56 And tonight I am honored beyond words to have the man that Lieutenant Lewis spoke of.
00:07:49.56 --> 00:08:02.60 Travis Mills here with us to talk through his experiences on the battlefield and off.
00:08:02.60 --> 00:08:05.68 Travis, welcome to the show.
00:08:05.68 --> 00:08:06.68 Good evening.
00:08:06.68 --> 00:08:08.36 Thank you for having me.
00:08:08.36 --> 00:08:10.36 That now I am going to say this upfront.
00:08:10.36 --> 00:08:20.52 I was a little nervous about having you on because this show has a reputation of being
00:08:20.52 --> 00:08:28.72 very serious and very solemn and I know that you have an issue with both of those terms
00:08:28.72 --> 00:08:31.72 in a broad perspective.
00:08:31.72 --> 00:08:38.08 So for those of you that haven't heard anything from Travis before, there's not a lot
00:08:38.08 --> 00:08:44.08 of serious stuff that Travis does.
00:08:44.08 --> 00:08:53.56 So serious comedian and hilarious guy with an incredible attitude.
00:08:53.56 --> 00:08:54.56 Welcome to the show man.
00:08:54.56 --> 00:08:55.56 Thanks for coming on.
00:08:55.56 --> 00:08:56.56 Thank you so much.
00:08:56.56 --> 00:08:59.16 I'll do my best to be serious.
00:08:59.16 --> 00:09:03.92 I think my altitude described it very well and that letter he wrote to his family.
00:09:03.92 --> 00:09:08.08 I made sure that I would cap the spirits up and I would hug him and everything like that,
00:09:08.08 --> 00:09:10.20 but under fire was a whole different person.
00:09:10.20 --> 00:09:11.20 Yeah.
00:09:11.20 --> 00:09:15.20 No, I thought he did a great job of capturing what everyone's feeling over there.
00:09:15.20 --> 00:09:21.08 And I didn't go in Afghanistan, but what is this similar to what we'd feel when I rack?
00:09:21.08 --> 00:09:27.08 And you know, I talk about this a lot about the fact that this is why guys miss combat.
00:09:27.08 --> 00:09:31.96 But you know, you miss combat, even though it's when you're over there and you're in this
00:09:31.96 --> 00:09:35.60 crappy situation and you're like, oh, I can't wait to get home, but then when you get home,
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:39.56 you have that little thing in the back of your mind that says, that misses that com
00:09:39.56 --> 00:09:42.08 rotter, which only comes from that place.
00:09:42.08 --> 00:09:45.16 So he did a good job of describing that.
00:09:45.16 --> 00:09:52.68 So I think to understand where a man ends up, we kind of got to understand where a man
00:09:52.68 --> 00:10:05.08 comes from, so going back to the beginning, the young Travis Mills, the young Travis Mills.
00:10:05.08 --> 00:10:10.60 And you know how you grew up and all that.
00:10:10.60 --> 00:10:11.60 Talk a little bit about that.
00:10:11.60 --> 00:10:13.60 Yeah, I'm from Michigan.
00:10:13.60 --> 00:10:17.40 When I go around and I speak throughout the nation, I always say, is anybody from Ohio
00:10:17.40 --> 00:10:20.56 before I tell my permission, and I yell, oh, oh, wait, and then they yell, oh, I go and
00:10:20.56 --> 00:10:24.12 get real passionate and then I yell sucks.
00:10:24.12 --> 00:10:28.68 You know, and I get some booze, but I'm from a small town in Michigan right around the
00:10:28.68 --> 00:10:29.68 thumb area.
00:10:29.68 --> 00:10:32.40 I grew up playing football, basketball, baseball.
00:10:32.40 --> 00:10:34.68 I have an older sister younger brother.
00:10:34.68 --> 00:10:38.68 My parents are phenomenal people and, you know, just good wholesome values.
00:10:38.68 --> 00:10:43.76 And then I went to college to play football after high school was over and decided that
00:10:43.76 --> 00:10:46.68 probably wasn't a right time for me to go to college and take a serious.
00:10:46.68 --> 00:10:47.68 So I went to the...
00:10:47.68 --> 00:10:48.68 So, hold on.
00:10:48.68 --> 00:10:51.52 I'm playing three sports in high school.
00:10:51.52 --> 00:10:55.24 And I got a quote from your book in here, by the way.
00:10:55.24 --> 00:10:58.000 I'm going to read it.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.12 I was the fun kid who lived at the end of your block.
00:11:01.12 --> 00:11:06.28 I was big for my age and for a lot of boyhood years, I had a big gap between my two
00:11:06.28 --> 00:11:07.28 front teeth.
00:11:07.28 --> 00:11:08.28 Yep.
00:11:08.28 --> 00:11:11.000 Now is that a negative thing?
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.24 Um, no, not at all.
00:11:13.24 --> 00:11:17.48 Okay, because some of us at the table here still have a gap between our four teachers.
00:11:17.48 --> 00:11:18.48 I'm just saying.
00:11:18.48 --> 00:11:20.48 Oh, I'm on the sides now, right?
00:11:20.48 --> 00:11:21.48 Yeah, I do.
00:11:21.48 --> 00:11:27.48 But I like to wear my hair shaved and a buzz cup, particularly in the summers when it
00:11:27.48 --> 00:11:30.24 got hot with that OP Taylor kind of look.
00:11:30.24 --> 00:11:33.72 I fit into small town America.
00:11:33.72 --> 00:11:36.60 And you did karate, by the way.
00:11:36.60 --> 00:11:39.16 You're looking at the 1993 cry state champion.
00:11:39.16 --> 00:11:41.52 I should get a match.
00:11:41.52 --> 00:11:44.04 I was six, but...
00:11:44.04 --> 00:11:45.04 That's it.
00:11:45.04 --> 00:11:47.04 It's not a competitive age bracket for karate championships.
00:11:47.04 --> 00:11:49.04 I just spent a back kick.
00:11:49.04 --> 00:11:50.04 I just read over the rest of the match.
00:11:50.04 --> 00:11:52.04 Breaking ribs.
00:11:52.04 --> 00:11:55.04 Actually, you had a contest here.
00:11:55.04 --> 00:11:56.64 I'm going to read about it.
00:11:56.64 --> 00:11:57.64 It wasn't all easy.
00:11:57.64 --> 00:12:01.24 And one of my first karate matches I got kicked hard in the sternum and couldn't breathe.
00:12:01.24 --> 00:12:03.64 I gasped pan and tried to suck air.
00:12:03.64 --> 00:12:07.08 When my normal breathing didn't return immediately, I raised my hand and four fitted the
00:12:07.08 --> 00:12:08.08 match.
00:12:08.08 --> 00:12:10.84 I'm kind of disappointed.
00:12:10.84 --> 00:12:12.32 My dad rushed over.
00:12:12.32 --> 00:12:13.52 Travis, what are you doing?
00:12:13.52 --> 00:12:14.84 You four for the match.
00:12:14.84 --> 00:12:15.84 You never four for the match.
00:12:15.84 --> 00:12:19.16 No matter how hard you're hurting, you never quit ever.
00:12:19.16 --> 00:12:23.36 Yeah, my dad was as disappointed in me too.
00:12:23.36 --> 00:12:24.36 So I never did again.
00:12:24.36 --> 00:12:25.36 And then I just, I don't know.
00:12:25.36 --> 00:12:27.36 I just went hard to rest of that after that.
00:12:27.36 --> 00:12:29.88 I just, I don't know my dad taught me good values.
00:12:29.88 --> 00:12:31.92 My mom took karate with me.
00:12:31.92 --> 00:12:34.52 So don't mess with your mom either.
00:12:34.52 --> 00:12:35.52 No, no.
00:12:35.52 --> 00:12:37.52 Well, yeah, don't.
00:12:37.52 --> 00:12:38.96 She's just five foot two.
00:12:38.96 --> 00:12:40.52 The 125 pounds.
00:12:40.52 --> 00:12:42.52 How did she produce your big ass?
00:12:42.52 --> 00:12:43.52 I don't know.
00:12:43.52 --> 00:12:45.12 How tall was your dad?
00:12:45.12 --> 00:12:46.12 Five, 11.
00:12:46.12 --> 00:12:47.12 No kiddo.
00:12:47.12 --> 00:12:48.12 Yeah.
00:12:48.12 --> 00:12:49.12 Yeah.
00:12:49.12 --> 00:12:52.16 But I was six foot three when I was at my walk around weight.
00:12:52.16 --> 00:12:55.48 And the first match I ever had, I had a girl and she beat me.
00:12:55.48 --> 00:12:56.48 Because I went and hit her.
00:12:56.48 --> 00:12:57.48 Yeah.
00:12:57.48 --> 00:12:59.000 And then I was cleared to like, hit girls and I thought that.
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.92 Okay, so next time I thought I went to town on, you know, just put a weapon.
00:13:03.92 --> 00:13:06.04 And now I know you don't hit girls either way.
00:13:06.04 --> 00:13:07.04 Yeah.
00:13:07.04 --> 00:13:08.04 So I learned, you know.
00:13:08.04 --> 00:13:09.04 That's a loose, loose situation.
00:13:09.04 --> 00:13:11.36 But then your mom told you no go hit her.
00:13:11.36 --> 00:13:12.36 Yeah.
00:13:12.36 --> 00:13:13.36 That's what it says in the book.
00:13:13.36 --> 00:13:15.36 It was like, hey, listen, you gotta go beat her up.
00:13:15.36 --> 00:13:16.36 Well, okay.
00:13:16.36 --> 00:13:18.36 So it was competition.
00:13:18.36 --> 00:13:21.12 And she was in my, you know, they didn't have this separate gender brackets.
00:13:21.12 --> 00:13:22.12 So everybody was the same.
00:13:22.12 --> 00:13:25.52 And the first girl I faced, I went and hit and I lost about.
00:13:25.52 --> 00:13:28.72 And then the next girl after that, my mom was like, you can, you can hit them.
00:13:28.72 --> 00:13:30.40 I was like, oh, okay.
00:13:30.40 --> 00:13:32.20 So I just like, you're going down.
00:13:32.20 --> 00:13:33.20 I'm gonna have to.
00:13:33.20 --> 00:13:35.20 And I went after it.
00:13:35.20 --> 00:13:37.24 Oh, that's jacked up man.
00:13:37.24 --> 00:13:39.24 I mean, I was six.
00:13:39.24 --> 00:13:40.64 I mean, I had, yeah, yeah.
00:13:40.64 --> 00:13:41.64 Yeah.
00:13:41.64 --> 00:13:42.64 You know.
00:13:42.64 --> 00:13:43.96 That was seven for me.
00:13:43.96 --> 00:13:50.20 The football team Vince Leville.
00:13:50.20 --> 00:13:51.20 Did I say that right?
00:13:51.20 --> 00:13:52.20 I love you, eh.
00:13:52.20 --> 00:13:53.20 Okay.
00:13:53.20 --> 00:13:54.20 Well, you know, I'm not way about it.
00:13:54.20 --> 00:13:56.20 So much of a French speaker over on my hand.
00:13:56.20 --> 00:13:57.40 Oh, whatever that language is.
00:13:57.40 --> 00:13:58.40 It's not known as name.
00:13:58.40 --> 00:13:59.76 I would have said the same thing.
00:13:59.76 --> 00:14:01.28 Here's how he described you.
00:14:01.28 --> 00:14:04.16 The first time I met Travis using middle school at Track Meat.
00:14:04.16 --> 00:14:05.16 I'd heard about him.
00:14:05.16 --> 00:14:06.16 So I went over to watch him.
00:14:06.16 --> 00:14:08.56 He won the shop put, which meant he was strong.
00:14:08.56 --> 00:14:12.04 Then he ran over, then he ran over to the 100 yard hurdles and won.
00:14:12.04 --> 00:14:13.72 Those, which meant he was fast.
00:14:13.72 --> 00:14:15.16 You don't see that combination a lot.
00:14:15.16 --> 00:14:17.96 I knew that this kid was going to be a special athlete.
00:14:17.96 --> 00:14:19.76 In high school, he became a superstar.
00:14:19.76 --> 00:14:22.96 Three sport athlete, baseball, basketball, and football.
00:14:22.96 --> 00:14:27.84 He was the leader on each team and made first team all conference in all three sports.
00:14:27.84 --> 00:14:30.56 With football, he was definitely a big cog in our team's wheel.
00:14:30.56 --> 00:14:34.52 We were the smallest going our conference and we got beat up for a lot of years.
00:14:34.52 --> 00:14:38.36 But his junior year Travis and his friends got into weightlifting and powerlifting and
00:14:38.36 --> 00:14:40.84 went to all the football camps.
00:14:40.84 --> 00:14:45.48 The year we won the conference championship and made the playoffs for the first time ever.
00:14:45.48 --> 00:14:48.96 Travis's work ethic motivated everybody.
00:14:48.96 --> 00:14:52.04 Everybody got stronger because Travis was their leader.
00:14:52.04 --> 00:14:53.04 Jack and Steel.
00:14:53.04 --> 00:14:55.64 What's your champions, dude?
00:14:55.64 --> 00:14:57.68 First time we were in the playoffs.
00:14:57.68 --> 00:15:00.92 How did you, what made you start lifting?
00:15:00.92 --> 00:15:06.92 Coach, that V.A. and when I was in seventh grade, he said that after school, if I wasn't
00:15:06.92 --> 00:15:09.28 playing a sport, I had to go to the flates.
00:15:09.28 --> 00:15:13.000 He was a vice principal, the high school, so having friends in high places is nice.
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.68 When you're getting trouble, you don't really get in trouble.
00:15:16.68 --> 00:15:21.76 The story in there about me getting trouble in class, freshman year.
00:15:21.76 --> 00:15:22.76 Where'd you do?
00:15:22.76 --> 00:15:27.44 I don't really, I broke a childish, never mind.
00:15:27.44 --> 00:15:28.64 But just tell us what you did.
00:15:28.64 --> 00:15:30.56 It's in the book, you know, I was performing now.
00:15:30.56 --> 00:15:33.68 My buddy fired in class, I kicked in the hallway, so then my other buddy did, so I wanted
00:15:33.68 --> 00:15:37.04 to go out there, so I found a lot of that one rip, so I can go out in the hallway.
00:15:37.04 --> 00:15:39.72 Take a send to the office, but you just like, guys, knock it off.
00:15:39.72 --> 00:15:40.72 You can't do this anymore.
00:15:40.72 --> 00:15:41.72 Too much protein powder?
00:15:41.72 --> 00:15:47.12 Oh, that's all, yeah, so my buddy, Eric, he got his parents, I'm very competitive, like
00:15:47.12 --> 00:15:48.12 mine were.
00:15:48.12 --> 00:15:52.32 And we were both the team captain and stars of the show, if he will, so I went home and
00:15:52.32 --> 00:15:54.68 said, hey, can I get some cell attack in nitro attack?
00:15:54.68 --> 00:15:57.12 And it was before like the had the rally regulations on it.
00:15:57.12 --> 00:15:58.68 And my parents like, no, he can't do that.
00:15:58.68 --> 00:16:01.32 I'm like, well, Eric's parents let him get it.
00:16:01.32 --> 00:16:02.32 Maybe wasn't true.
00:16:02.32 --> 00:16:06.16 Eric went home to the same thing to his parents, so we both got to get on those.
00:16:06.16 --> 00:16:07.52 And I mean, you know, protein powder.
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:08.52 Yeah.
00:16:08.52 --> 00:16:10.08 That's going to disrupt science class.
00:16:10.08 --> 00:16:11.08 Yeah.
00:16:11.08 --> 00:16:12.08 We beat it.
00:16:12.08 --> 00:16:14.72 But no, I mean, it was fun.
00:16:14.72 --> 00:16:19.28 Everybody, I worked at a grocery store after the football games, the old man would come in,
00:16:19.28 --> 00:16:21.08 drink coffee and hang out with me.
00:16:21.08 --> 00:16:23.48 And my boss just like the owner of the storage accepted it.
00:16:23.48 --> 00:16:25.76 Like the wives would shop and I was like, you get away with it.
00:16:25.76 --> 00:16:28.12 Yeah, I was at the water cooler, but it was a coffee pot.
00:16:28.12 --> 00:16:29.12 And we just hang out.
00:16:29.12 --> 00:16:31.12 And the time when I did wrong, why did right?
00:16:31.12 --> 00:16:34.36 Very varsity, varsity blues, tile.
00:16:34.36 --> 00:16:35.36 Right, right.
00:16:35.36 --> 00:16:38.56 Yeah, I saw some video footage of you at those games.
00:16:38.56 --> 00:16:40.76 There was like madness at those games.
00:16:40.76 --> 00:16:43.80 Well, the one run I had was it looked pretty good on the film.
00:16:43.80 --> 00:16:44.92 Yeah, it looked pretty good to me.
00:16:44.92 --> 00:16:47.68 It's one time I did anything special.
00:16:47.68 --> 00:16:51.24 So you get done with your senior year of football.
00:16:51.24 --> 00:16:55.08 And did you maintain the high level of discipline in your grades after that point?
00:16:55.08 --> 00:16:56.08 No.
00:16:56.08 --> 00:16:57.08 No.
00:16:57.08 --> 00:17:00.96 Actually, I broke up with the girlfriend at the four point, oh.
00:17:00.96 --> 00:17:01.96 Oh.
00:17:01.96 --> 00:17:02.96 So my grades went right down.
00:17:02.96 --> 00:17:03.96 Yeah.
00:17:03.96 --> 00:17:04.96 No more study partner.
00:17:04.96 --> 00:17:06.76 No more like she would help you homework.
00:17:06.76 --> 00:17:09.44 Yeah, being the same class and right left handed for the scratch work.
00:17:09.44 --> 00:17:10.44 Hand to me.
00:17:10.44 --> 00:17:13.60 Sorry, right nothing like that.
00:17:13.60 --> 00:17:16.36 And so that that man, did you get looked at?
00:17:16.36 --> 00:17:18.08 Did you get looked at for college ball?
00:17:18.08 --> 00:17:19.08 I did.
00:17:19.08 --> 00:17:22.56 I had a couple of offers for baseball and football.
00:17:22.56 --> 00:17:25.48 D2, couple D1, smaller D1.
00:17:25.48 --> 00:17:29.60 And for some reason, my guidance counselor, he just, I think he just knew Mr. Simpson.
00:17:29.60 --> 00:17:30.60 Great guy.
00:17:30.60 --> 00:17:33.16 He kind of figured I wasn't going to like college and be disciplined enough.
00:17:33.16 --> 00:17:34.56 So he's like, what about this community college?
00:17:34.56 --> 00:17:36.80 It's a really good.
00:17:36.80 --> 00:17:38.44 You can go there and play football.
00:17:38.44 --> 00:17:42.80 And I decided to go there and I just, I mean, I was cut off for football.
00:17:42.80 --> 00:17:46.24 I wasn't cut off for the study in there at that time in my life.
00:17:46.24 --> 00:17:47.24 Right.
00:17:47.24 --> 00:17:48.92 And so you went there for one year?
00:17:48.92 --> 00:17:49.92 Some Esther.
00:17:49.92 --> 00:17:50.92 One semester.
00:17:50.92 --> 00:17:51.68 And then my girlfriend was like, you should move home.
00:17:51.68 --> 00:17:52.68 So I did.
00:17:52.68 --> 00:17:53.68 Yeah.
00:17:53.68 --> 00:17:54.68 And then I met her boyfriend Colin.
00:17:54.68 --> 00:17:57.68 So then I joined the army.
00:17:57.68 --> 00:17:58.92 You look back in my life.
00:17:58.92 --> 00:17:59.92 How does happen?
00:17:59.92 --> 00:18:00.92 Yeah.
00:18:00.92 --> 00:18:01.92 It's her fault.
00:18:01.92 --> 00:18:02.92 Colin.
00:18:02.92 --> 00:18:03.92 What's your calling lately?
00:18:03.92 --> 00:18:04.92 I haven't talked.
00:18:04.92 --> 00:18:05.92 I haven't.
00:18:05.92 --> 00:18:06.92 Yeah.
00:18:06.92 --> 00:18:07.92 We all look him up.
00:18:07.92 --> 00:18:11.48 I mean, he worked at a, you know, the pop up golf course when I found everything out.
00:18:11.48 --> 00:18:15.40 So I grew up in my body up and went over there in the manager's place like Phantom home.
00:18:15.40 --> 00:18:17.16 Why did you tell you to come home?
00:18:17.16 --> 00:18:18.76 This is because I could be by her, I guess.
00:18:18.76 --> 00:18:19.76 I don't know.
00:18:19.76 --> 00:18:21.20 And then I was like, hey, what's this about?
00:18:21.20 --> 00:18:22.84 And then she found a broke down to home.
00:18:22.84 --> 00:18:25.76 And I was like, oh, hey, did you know the army was taking people and giving bonuses?
00:18:25.76 --> 00:18:26.76 Yeah.
00:18:26.76 --> 00:18:27.76 Because you were dead.
00:18:27.76 --> 00:18:28.76 You were, you ran up.
00:18:28.76 --> 00:18:31.44 I was, you know, it was about 10 grand in debt for me in the college.
00:18:31.44 --> 00:18:32.44 But that was for the whole year.
00:18:32.44 --> 00:18:34.72 So the baseball coach asked me to play there too.
00:18:34.72 --> 00:18:35.72 Day.
00:18:35.72 --> 00:18:36.72 Um, yeah.
00:18:36.72 --> 00:18:39.72 But then you, uh, you're in debt.
00:18:39.72 --> 00:18:44.000 You're, um, Colin was on the scene now that kind of threw a loop.
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.40 So you see, you're in up during the army.
00:18:45.40 --> 00:18:46.40 I joined the army.
00:18:46.40 --> 00:18:49.16 I went to all their crewters and the army had the best thing going.
00:18:49.16 --> 00:18:50.16 Which was cash.
00:18:50.16 --> 00:18:51.16 $24,000.
00:18:51.16 --> 00:18:53.68 You're not money's at today.
00:18:53.68 --> 00:18:54.68 No idea.
00:18:54.68 --> 00:18:55.68 Yeah.
00:18:55.68 --> 00:18:56.68 Yeah.
00:18:56.68 --> 00:18:58.08 Does, did Budweiser get any of that money?
00:18:58.08 --> 00:18:59.08 You know, no.
00:18:59.08 --> 00:19:00.08 No.
00:19:00.08 --> 00:19:01.08 I'm actually, I'm not a beer.
00:19:01.08 --> 00:19:02.08 Not a booser.
00:19:02.08 --> 00:19:03.08 Oh, whoa.
00:19:03.08 --> 00:19:04.08 Oh, whoa.
00:19:04.08 --> 00:19:05.08 Oh, whoa.
00:19:05.08 --> 00:19:06.08 Oh, no.
00:19:06.08 --> 00:19:07.08 No, that's not good.
00:19:07.08 --> 00:19:08.08 That far.
00:19:08.08 --> 00:19:09.08 I'm a whiskey fan.
00:19:09.08 --> 00:19:10.08 Okay.
00:19:10.08 --> 00:19:14.08 But, uh, no, I mean, I just, I saw a way to pay my bills back.
00:19:14.08 --> 00:19:16.44 I saw a way to travel and do some more fun stuff.
00:19:16.44 --> 00:19:17.44 I went there to be in like Tritian.
00:19:17.44 --> 00:19:19.08 And they showed me airborne videos.
00:19:19.08 --> 00:19:20.28 I was like, I want that.
00:19:20.28 --> 00:19:21.28 Oh, yeah.
00:19:21.28 --> 00:19:22.28 Deal.
00:19:22.28 --> 00:19:23.28 Deal.
00:19:23.28 --> 00:19:24.28 What's that called?
00:19:24.28 --> 00:19:25.28 Bait and sweatshirt.
00:19:25.28 --> 00:19:26.28 Yeah.
00:19:26.28 --> 00:19:27.28 Yeah.
00:19:27.28 --> 00:19:28.04 But I really want to do is I want to get a good, um, thing, you know, when I can carry on in this
00:19:28.04 --> 00:19:31.04 feeling life and have a good trade that you have that I can bring back this feeling.
00:19:31.04 --> 00:19:33.04 I don't know what they're like, watch this video.
00:19:33.04 --> 00:19:34.04 You're like, yes.
00:19:34.04 --> 00:19:35.04 Yes.
00:19:35.04 --> 00:19:36.04 That's me.
00:19:36.04 --> 00:19:37.04 That's all.
00:19:37.04 --> 00:19:40.04 So, it showed you an, uh, is it like airborne recruiting video?
00:19:40.04 --> 00:19:45.28 Um, well, to be honest with you, I was a ranger, regimen, recruiting video and I signed
00:19:45.28 --> 00:19:48.72 up for all that, but then all the rumors were like, if you don't make it, you're going
00:19:48.72 --> 00:19:50.76 to create a, and I'm like, I don't want to go to Korea.
00:19:50.76 --> 00:19:51.76 Yeah.
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:55.24 And then 22 of my friends went to Fort Bragg because you got to pick a dude's stations
00:19:55.24 --> 00:19:56.72 they were filling up the new brigades.
00:19:56.72 --> 00:19:57.72 Yeah.
00:19:57.72 --> 00:20:00.08 And they're like, oh, you guys, we need you to fill in here and you can pick where you go.
00:20:00.08 --> 00:20:01.76 So, all of us from basic training went.
00:20:01.76 --> 00:20:02.76 Because what year was this?
00:20:02.76 --> 00:20:03.76 Uh, 2006.
00:20:03.76 --> 00:20:04.76 Oh, yeah.
00:20:04.76 --> 00:20:08.76 So, that's, so that's totally different from me because I joined the Navy in 1990.
00:20:08.76 --> 00:20:09.76 Oh, yeah.
00:20:09.76 --> 00:20:11.60 That's before I was even a cry stage champion.
00:20:11.60 --> 00:20:12.60 Yeah.
00:20:12.60 --> 00:20:13.60 Yeah.
00:20:13.60 --> 00:20:14.60 We're talking all this.
00:20:14.60 --> 00:20:15.60 Yeah.
00:20:15.60 --> 00:20:16.60 So, there was no war going on.
00:20:16.60 --> 00:20:20.32 And even though in my mind, I always thought like the seals were just like fighting
00:20:20.32 --> 00:20:24.04 wars worldwide at all times, which was not true.
00:20:24.04 --> 00:20:25.28 But I thought that.
00:20:25.28 --> 00:20:29.12 But yeah, it wasn't like, everyone that was joining the military, it's not like when you
00:20:29.12 --> 00:20:32.64 guys joined, your generation of people joined, you knew you were going to war.
00:20:32.64 --> 00:20:33.64 Oh, absolutely.
00:20:33.64 --> 00:20:34.64 100%.
00:20:34.64 --> 00:20:39.48 You know, the biggest regret I actually do have and not to kiss up to what you've done,
00:20:39.48 --> 00:20:44.68 but it's not tried to go to the Rangers or Ghost Special Forces or to see, like,
00:20:44.68 --> 00:20:46.52 I didn't even try, I wish I would have.
00:20:46.52 --> 00:20:49.64 Well, you would have, did you start thinking about that further in your career?
00:20:49.64 --> 00:20:50.64 Absolutely.
00:20:50.64 --> 00:20:54.48 I was going to come back and I was either going to go to Cruder and get my last year
00:20:54.48 --> 00:20:55.48 and a half a college.
00:20:55.48 --> 00:20:56.96 I went to college when I could.
00:20:56.96 --> 00:20:58.80 I took college out on investments.
00:20:58.80 --> 00:21:03.20 And I was going to try to go recruited to go ahead and get my degree and then go to the
00:21:03.20 --> 00:21:07.08 Special Operations World because if you don't do it that way, if you become an officer,
00:21:07.08 --> 00:21:08.88 you got to go back through the queue.
00:21:08.88 --> 00:21:09.88 Okay.
00:21:09.88 --> 00:21:14.92 But there's either going to be go rights to Special Operations and try that out or go
00:21:14.92 --> 00:21:16.08 become an officer and then go.
00:21:16.08 --> 00:21:19.32 But yeah, just, you know, I don't know.
00:21:19.32 --> 00:21:20.72 I have no excuses for that.
00:21:20.72 --> 00:21:21.72 It's a weird thing.
00:21:21.72 --> 00:21:22.72 It's a weird thing.
00:21:22.72 --> 00:21:28.08 And I don't really like, anybody, like, I was, if you compare you as an athlete in high school
00:21:28.08 --> 00:21:30.68 and me as an athlete in high school, it's not even comparable.
00:21:30.68 --> 00:21:33.32 You were like 10 times the athlete I was.
00:21:33.32 --> 00:21:37.16 For some reason, I was stupid enough to think like I can make it through that training.
00:21:37.16 --> 00:21:40.12 And you weren't smart enough to go like, I can make that through the training.
00:21:40.12 --> 00:21:41.12 Because you would.
00:21:41.12 --> 00:21:45.16 And the saddest thing is with the whole the Ranger contract I had and all these guys were
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:48.000 going and I got talked to my buddies and going in Fort Bragg.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.88 I ran to the bunch of them and they're like, oh yeah, we made it.
00:21:49.88 --> 00:21:53.000 I was like, oh my gosh, I could have, I was, you know, I was interested in it.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.80 It's an interesting, it's an interesting, it's actually humility.
00:21:56.80 --> 00:22:02.80 It's you being like, hey man, you know, I don't know, I played football and baseball and
00:22:02.80 --> 00:22:03.80 ran track.
00:22:03.80 --> 00:22:04.80 Was that right?
00:22:04.80 --> 00:22:05.80 Well, I'm basketball.
00:22:05.80 --> 00:22:07.40 Football baseball and basketball.
00:22:07.40 --> 00:22:09.32 I'm a great athlete, but I might not make it through.
00:22:09.32 --> 00:22:12.16 That's actually a form of humility, you know?
00:22:12.16 --> 00:22:13.16 I think it is.
00:22:13.16 --> 00:22:14.80 I was just, yeah, I don't know where I had was that.
00:22:14.80 --> 00:22:17.84 I just, I, you know, looking back now, I'm embarrassed about it a little bit.
00:22:17.84 --> 00:22:19.68 I wish I, I wish I were to went and try it out.
00:22:19.68 --> 00:22:21.44 I mean, I live a really good life.
00:22:21.44 --> 00:22:22.68 I have a wonderful life and everything.
00:22:22.68 --> 00:22:23.68 Not to jump ahead.
00:22:23.68 --> 00:22:24.88 Two beautiful children.
00:22:24.88 --> 00:22:25.88 So life's good.
00:22:25.88 --> 00:22:27.44 His bad is a situation.
00:22:27.44 --> 00:22:33.08 I, you know, I found myself in an April of 2012, but look back, I wish I would have tried
00:22:33.08 --> 00:22:34.08 something.
00:22:34.08 --> 00:22:35.08 Yeah.
00:22:35.08 --> 00:22:36.08 Yeah.
00:22:36.08 --> 00:22:39.12 I mean, but the 80 second airborne is which is where you ended up is freaking awesome
00:22:39.12 --> 00:22:40.12 unit.
00:22:40.12 --> 00:22:41.12 Oh, yeah.
00:22:41.12 --> 00:22:42.12 I mean, I think it's cool.
00:22:42.12 --> 00:22:44.80 And everybody's like, all about standards.
00:22:44.80 --> 00:22:49.04 How do you like, and this is something I, because a lot of people that listen to podcast,
00:22:49.04 --> 00:22:51.64 they join the military, believe it or not.
00:22:51.64 --> 00:22:55.60 And like, we just met a guy the other day who's going to September 18th going to the
00:22:55.60 --> 00:22:56.88 Marine Corps.
00:22:56.88 --> 00:23:01.48 But I always want to tell them like, when you show up to boot camp, it's going to be
00:23:01.48 --> 00:23:02.48 a shock to your system.
00:23:02.48 --> 00:23:03.48 Right?
00:23:03.48 --> 00:23:04.88 I mean, it is going to be, you're going to lack of sleep.
00:23:04.88 --> 00:23:06.28 It's not going to be stuff that you're used to.
00:23:06.28 --> 00:23:09.80 It, it sounds like you got a little, you know, shock to your system.
00:23:09.80 --> 00:23:12.64 You showed up there of just normal military stuff.
00:23:12.64 --> 00:23:17.24 And I guess my point in saying that is when you show up to boot camp, boot camp is not going
00:23:17.24 --> 00:23:18.24 to be fun for you.
00:23:18.24 --> 00:23:19.24 It's going to be a transition.
00:23:19.24 --> 00:23:21.24 I mean, you can mentally prepare all day.
00:23:21.24 --> 00:23:23.84 You know, and then you get yelled at and you're like, why is it guy always?
00:23:23.84 --> 00:23:24.84 Yeah.
00:23:24.84 --> 00:23:25.84 I didn't, I didn't do any wrong.
00:23:25.84 --> 00:23:26.84 Leave me alone.
00:23:26.84 --> 00:23:28.24 They made me eat coldslaw.
00:23:28.24 --> 00:23:29.24 I don't even like coldslaw.
00:23:29.24 --> 00:23:33.24 I mean, the first thing like I come out and they're like, I guess coldslaw, if I
00:23:33.24 --> 00:23:34.24 launch, I'm like shit.
00:23:34.24 --> 00:23:35.24 I don't.
00:23:35.24 --> 00:23:36.24 I don't.
00:23:36.24 --> 00:23:37.24 So they put it on my plate.
00:23:37.24 --> 00:23:38.24 And then after I eat the coldslaw, I eat first.
00:23:38.24 --> 00:23:40.24 I'm like, he must be eating this for the reason.
00:23:40.24 --> 00:23:41.24 So I'm just just, do this.
00:23:41.24 --> 00:23:43.24 And then the next time I dinner, I'm like, okay, finally no coldslaw.
00:23:43.24 --> 00:23:45.24 It's like, middle is a big bastard.
00:23:45.24 --> 00:23:47.24 You, first, I remember you, you get to school.
00:23:47.24 --> 00:23:48.24 You're coldslaw.
00:23:48.24 --> 00:23:51.24 Yeah.
00:23:51.24 --> 00:23:52.24 Right.
00:23:52.24 --> 00:23:53.24 You know, so.
00:23:53.24 --> 00:23:54.24 Yeah.
00:23:54.24 --> 00:23:55.24 Yeah.
00:23:55.24 --> 00:23:56.24 That's, that's bootcamp, right?
00:23:56.24 --> 00:23:57.24 Yeah.
00:23:57.24 --> 00:23:58.24 That's pretty good.
00:23:58.24 --> 00:24:00.24 I always felt when I talked to people that are going, I'm like, just play the game.
00:24:00.24 --> 00:24:01.24 Yeah.
00:24:01.24 --> 00:24:02.24 Understand, it's going to end and make the army.
00:24:02.24 --> 00:24:03.24 What you can make it.
00:24:03.24 --> 00:24:04.24 Like, make it work for you.
00:24:04.24 --> 00:24:06.24 Understand the job you're getting yourself into.
00:24:06.24 --> 00:24:09.24 And things like that because people ask, would you still join if you know what happened?
00:24:09.24 --> 00:24:11.24 I said, yeah, absolutely I would.
00:24:11.24 --> 00:24:13.24 I enjoyed every second.
00:24:13.24 --> 00:24:14.24 I was going to be a 20 year guy.
00:24:14.24 --> 00:24:16.24 I figured I really listed it.
00:24:16.24 --> 00:24:17.24 And just, you know.
00:24:17.24 --> 00:24:18.24 It's cool.
00:24:18.24 --> 00:24:22.24 This is a cool thing that you wrote kind of as you're wrapping a bootcamp.
00:24:22.24 --> 00:24:24.24 You're thinking about September 11th.
00:24:24.24 --> 00:24:29.24 You know, like I said, that for you is one of you clearly knew that going in in 2006.
00:24:29.24 --> 00:24:30.24 And here's what you said.
00:24:30.24 --> 00:24:38.24 I remember feeling a ragged mix of emotions, anger, confusion, dismay, and wondering why anybody would want to do this to us.
00:24:38.24 --> 00:24:40.24 I was American.
00:24:40.24 --> 00:24:44.24 I understood we'd been attacked and that our country was now at war.
00:24:44.24 --> 00:24:58.24 And that when there's a war, somebody needs to have the courage and intestinal where we're fall to do the actual defending, fighting, and unavoidable killing that a company military actions.
00:24:58.24 --> 00:25:02.24 That would turn out to be me.
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:06.24 And that's another thing that people need to think about if you're doing it in the military.
00:25:06.24 --> 00:25:09.24 And I've gone through this with a bunch of people that, you know, this happened a year long time ago.
00:25:09.24 --> 00:25:13.24 This parent, you know, said, can you come talk to my son and he really wants to be a seal?
00:25:13.24 --> 00:25:15.24 And I was like, yeah, sure, no problem.
00:25:15.24 --> 00:25:22.24 And so I meet this kid, strapping young kid, looks super happy and positive, and he does water polo, and he's a great athlete.
00:25:22.24 --> 00:25:24.24 And he's like, I really want to join the seal teams.
00:25:24.24 --> 00:25:26.24 You know, what advice do you have from him?
00:25:26.24 --> 00:25:28.24 Are you ready to kill people?
00:25:28.24 --> 00:25:29.24 And are you ready to die?
00:25:29.24 --> 00:25:33.24 And it was like the whole room got wild just them too, but they're looking at me like, I'm crazy.
00:25:33.24 --> 00:25:38.24 But my point was, like, that's what the military is.
00:25:38.24 --> 00:25:40.24 You kill people in your risk of your life.
00:25:40.24 --> 00:25:42.24 That's what the military is.
00:25:42.24 --> 00:25:48.24 I mean, yeah, absolutely, they have the combat and non-combat MMSs, you know, just in every
00:25:48.24 --> 00:25:49.24 Every service.
00:25:49.24 --> 00:25:52.24 So with the seal teams with the infantry, that's what your job is.
00:25:52.24 --> 00:25:55.24 And you're willing to risk your life for others.
00:25:55.24 --> 00:26:00.24 I mean, it's just when I signed up, I was like, yeah, I'm ready to do this, but you never really understand everything.
00:26:00.24 --> 00:26:03.24 And then when you go through base training, they show you all these videos.
00:26:03.24 --> 00:26:08.24 And a lot of it, they showed a lot of band of brother stuff, which is what got me interested in going into the military.
00:26:08.24 --> 00:26:12.24 And I just took it as like, this is what I was wanting to do.
00:26:12.24 --> 00:26:13.24 This is awesome.
00:26:13.24 --> 00:26:14.24 But I get what you're saying.
00:26:14.24 --> 00:26:16.24 And people ask me, can you talk to myself, I'm not a doing this?
00:26:16.24 --> 00:26:18.24 No, no, no.
00:26:18.24 --> 00:26:20.24 You can't talk to people.
00:26:20.24 --> 00:26:22.24 You're young man on a doing this stuff.
00:26:22.24 --> 00:26:25.24 You're fine people that want to tell you, like, well, I was going to join, but then I did this.
00:26:25.24 --> 00:26:27.24 And I'm like, I don't care.
00:26:27.24 --> 00:26:30.24 Like, don't, you know, and everybody I talked to, not everybody, but I've got to talk to
00:26:30.24 --> 00:26:32.24 They got to give me their worst story possible.
00:26:32.24 --> 00:26:36.24 And I'm like, oh, I got a brother's friend that lost two legs, you know,
00:26:36.24 --> 00:26:38.24 and a bear trap.
00:26:38.24 --> 00:26:39.24 Okay.
00:26:39.24 --> 00:26:41.24 So I know what you're going through.
00:26:41.24 --> 00:26:43.24 I don't, okay.
00:26:43.24 --> 00:26:45.24 That works for me, I guess.
00:26:45.24 --> 00:26:47.24 Do you watch out for them bear traps?
00:26:47.24 --> 00:26:48.24 I know, sneak up on you.
00:26:48.24 --> 00:26:49.24 My brother's friend.
00:26:49.24 --> 00:26:50.24 That was crazy.
00:26:50.24 --> 00:26:53.24 I met him one time, but I give what your, I don't know exactly what you're doing.
00:26:53.24 --> 00:26:54.24 Okay.
00:26:54.24 --> 00:26:56.24 Dude, this cracked me up.
00:26:56.24 --> 00:26:58.24 You're at Airborne School.
00:26:58.24 --> 00:27:00.24 Most, you're, you're doing your first jumps.
00:27:00.24 --> 00:27:02.24 You five jumps at Airborne School.
00:27:02.24 --> 00:27:04.24 Most back to the book, most were without incident,
00:27:04.24 --> 00:27:08.24 except my third jump, which was supposed to be a daytime combat jump with full gear.
00:27:08.24 --> 00:27:10.24 On the way down, I dropped my rocks act too slowly.
00:27:10.24 --> 00:27:13.24 You're supposed to release it when you come to the tree line,
00:27:13.24 --> 00:27:15.24 but when I release the pack, it stayed just ahead of me,
00:27:15.24 --> 00:27:18.24 and I landed on top of the metal frame.
00:27:18.24 --> 00:27:19.24 Frame.
00:27:19.24 --> 00:27:20.24 Ouch, I yelled in pain.
00:27:20.24 --> 00:27:23.24 The jump master was already on the ground and yelled back at me.
00:27:23.24 --> 00:27:25.24 Did you bring something private Mills?
00:27:25.24 --> 00:27:28.24 I said, no, he glared at me and added,
00:27:28.24 --> 00:27:29.24 the shut up.
00:27:29.24 --> 00:27:30.24 I shut up.
00:27:30.24 --> 00:27:33.24 Airborne School's real good.
00:27:33.24 --> 00:27:34.24 Airborne School's really funny.
00:27:34.24 --> 00:27:36.24 And so this is what happened to me at Airborne School.
00:27:36.24 --> 00:27:38.24 I was, for if, I'm not like,
00:27:38.24 --> 00:27:42.24 I'm a person that falls fast through the air when parachuting.
00:27:42.24 --> 00:27:43.24 I don't know why.
00:27:43.24 --> 00:27:44.24 I'm just one of those people.
00:27:44.24 --> 00:27:45.24 You don't float.
00:27:45.24 --> 00:27:46.24 No, I don't float.
00:27:46.24 --> 00:27:50.24 And the other thing was, I didn't like doing a PLF,
00:27:50.24 --> 00:27:52.24 which is the proper way to land,
00:27:52.24 --> 00:27:53.24 which is you keep your feet knees together,
00:27:53.24 --> 00:27:55.24 and then you like act like you have one big leg,
00:27:55.24 --> 00:27:58.24 and that's the way you're supposed to prevent getting injured,
00:27:58.24 --> 00:28:00.24 break in your ankle or knee or whatever.
00:28:00.24 --> 00:28:02.24 And so when I was parachuting at Airborne School,
00:28:02.24 --> 00:28:03.24 I wasn't really doing a PLF.
00:28:03.24 --> 00:28:06.24 I was just kind of athletically landing on my feet, right?
00:28:06.24 --> 00:28:11.24 So anyways, they got these loudspeakers down on the field.
00:28:11.24 --> 00:28:13.24 And as all these new guys, all of us are just new.
00:28:13.24 --> 00:28:15.24 And the guys on the megaphone, he goes,
00:28:15.24 --> 00:28:17.24 and he's talking to me because my feet are apart.
00:28:17.24 --> 00:28:19.24 And I'm just going to do an athletic lady goes.
00:28:19.24 --> 00:28:21.24 Feet knees together, Airborne.
00:28:21.24 --> 00:28:22.24 Feet knees together, Airborne.
00:28:22.24 --> 00:28:23.24 Feet knees together, Airborne.
00:28:23.24 --> 00:28:24.24 Feet knees together, Airborne.
00:28:24.24 --> 00:28:26.24 You all right, Airborne?
00:28:26.24 --> 00:28:30.24 So, yeah, I thought that was funny.
00:28:30.24 --> 00:28:33.24 Did it hurt?
00:28:33.24 --> 00:28:34.24 No, I didn't get hurt.
00:28:34.24 --> 00:28:35.24 That's impressive.
00:28:35.24 --> 00:28:38.24 Because I was actually a jump master.
00:28:38.24 --> 00:28:40.24 Very towards the end of my military.
00:28:40.24 --> 00:28:41.24 Yeah, that was in.
00:28:41.24 --> 00:28:44.24 And got the balls of feet calf.
00:28:44.24 --> 00:28:46.24 I had an ulna that you dialed.
00:28:46.24 --> 00:28:49.24 Those instructors, how long is the jump master school
00:28:49.24 --> 00:28:51.24 to be an instructor at forebending?
00:28:51.24 --> 00:28:53.24 Well, it's completely different.
00:28:53.24 --> 00:28:55.24 So, I mean, it's not that much different, I guess.
00:28:55.24 --> 00:28:57.24 But for me, it was like a three-week course,
00:28:57.24 --> 00:28:58.24 and I was able to like check people's equipment.
00:28:58.24 --> 00:29:01.24 But they didn't make you memorize the term, and all they did did.
00:29:01.24 --> 00:29:02.24 Did they?
00:29:02.24 --> 00:29:05.24 You got to memorize the pre-jump brief and everything and stuff
00:29:05.24 --> 00:29:10.24 at that, but no, like this is a nylon stitch with 5,000 drain tests
00:29:10.24 --> 00:29:12.24 and steel that's stronger than America.
00:29:12.24 --> 00:29:15.24 So, that's no way it's stronger than America.
00:29:15.24 --> 00:29:16.24 No way.
00:29:16.24 --> 00:29:19.24 But no, they don't do that to you.
00:29:19.24 --> 00:29:22.24 Yeah, that's a good time.
00:29:24.24 --> 00:29:27.24 You're getting ready for your first deployment.
00:29:27.24 --> 00:29:30.24 I'm going to show you about 80 second ever one.
00:29:30.24 --> 00:29:31.24 You're there.
00:29:31.24 --> 00:29:33.24 You're getting ready for your first deployment.
00:29:33.24 --> 00:29:35.24 You know you're going to Afghanistan.
00:29:35.24 --> 00:29:38.24 And you're leaving just after Christmas.
00:29:38.24 --> 00:29:40.24 And here we're going to the book.
00:29:40.24 --> 00:29:43.24 My dad didn't talk to me about leaving.
00:29:43.24 --> 00:29:45.24 Over the next few days, we hung out,
00:29:45.24 --> 00:29:47.24 and did whenever we normally did.
00:29:47.24 --> 00:29:49.24 But most he said during that time was,
00:29:49.24 --> 00:29:52.24 be sure to keep your head down.
00:29:52.24 --> 00:29:54.24 Then the day before I left,
00:29:54.24 --> 00:29:59.76 story about when he went into the army. He'd taken Waspill paint and written a note to his
00:29:59.76 --> 00:30:05.24 parents and their shower stall where they were sure to be able to see it. It said one
00:30:05.24 --> 00:30:13.20 short sentence of reassurance, all will be fine. Early the morning that I left, I took a
00:30:13.20 --> 00:30:18.08 Waspill marker and went into my parents' bathroom, right above the faucets where they
00:30:18.08 --> 00:30:25.76 were sure to see it. I wrote the same short message, all will be fine. I was miles away
00:30:25.76 --> 00:30:32.40 from the house where my dad called. He told me he saw the note. I didn't say much and he
00:30:32.40 --> 00:30:39.44 didn't say much. He told me, love me, then his voice became horse and his words of support
00:30:39.44 --> 00:30:50.72 for me came out broken and choked. First time going on the point. It was a little rough too
00:30:50.72 --> 00:30:56.80 because I got from my hometown, a Marine, he was a body of mine. He has my baseball coach,
00:30:56.80 --> 00:31:01.36 his brother was in my grade. On the day after Christmas on the 26th he got shot by a sniper
00:31:01.36 --> 00:31:07.04 and I rack and ended up right through his heart and he didn't make it home. So, my brother
00:31:07.04 --> 00:31:13.36 actually has girlfriend that Chris is a little sister and she was at my house and I found out
00:31:13.36 --> 00:31:18.40 from friends that what had happened before the family found out, from people that were deployed
00:31:18.40 --> 00:31:24.80 with the unit. That was rough in my parents to have me in a couple of weeks going overseas and
00:31:24.80 --> 00:31:28.56 then I'm at home and they have to Christmas. Guy got shot that I know.
00:31:28.56 --> 00:31:36.24 Yeah, there's one, I think that's one of the hardest things for when military families see
00:31:37.68 --> 00:31:44.72 someone wounded or killed. They know that that could be their loved one. That's why I mean,
00:31:44.72 --> 00:31:50.80 days before you're leaving, man. That's harsh. And then we're close friends with the family. Like I
00:31:50.80 --> 00:31:58.16 said, his dad coach me from 10 years old up to 14 and 14 or 15. But
00:31:58.16 --> 00:32:02.72 you know, knew the family are there well. So, so is a little rough and things like that for a bit
00:32:02.72 --> 00:32:07.28 on my parents. But, you know, people now when they see me, they say, hey, do you go and speak
00:32:07.28 --> 00:32:10.80 to a lot of military things? I'm like, you know, I don't really do that that much of they want me
00:32:10.80 --> 00:32:13.84 to come in that will, but I'm not sure, but guys going overseas want to see me on stage.
00:32:13.84 --> 00:32:18.56 Hey, guys, you're going to be a okay. You know, I mean, it's trying not throughout. I mean,
00:32:18.56 --> 00:32:22.48 I thought a lot of companies, but when it comes down that, I'm like, hey, guys, you'll be good
00:32:22.48 --> 00:32:26.72 over there. It's like some movie that that six, I don't know what that is, but they're like,
00:32:26.72 --> 00:32:31.12 if Dream Amy the man I am today. Yeah, yeah, I've never seen it. But I get told that line.
00:32:31.12 --> 00:32:35.84 He's got like two fake legs. He's good. He's real good with movie quotes, especially bad movie.
00:32:35.84 --> 00:32:39.84 I'm so glad I forgot you were here. No, it's great. I've never known when chime in.
00:32:43.04 --> 00:32:46.08 So, your first deployment, what are you, are you an E3, E4?
00:32:46.96 --> 00:32:50.72 When I went over there, I think I was an E3. That's, I might have been an E2, actually.
00:32:50.72 --> 00:32:56.24 My favorite movie. Okay. I was only in a military six months for I to put it. That's crazy.
00:32:57.28 --> 00:33:01.76 Oh, it was a good time. I worked for a kernel. Yeah, I was doing basically PSD for the kernel, right?
00:33:01.76 --> 00:33:06.48 Yeah. Yeah. So, like, try being a young private, you go to a unit that's not an infantry. You don't
00:33:06.48 --> 00:33:12.80 get treated like crap. You work for a Lieutenant Colonel who's a direct descendant of
00:33:12.80 --> 00:33:17.44 Colonel Custer. He's a, it was his great uncle. The guy's just as wild. It's got a D.
00:33:17.44 --> 00:33:21.28 And he always walk around saying, what's better than a pair of vases, guys? Two pair and he
00:33:21.28 --> 00:33:26.80 show like the double A's on his own. And phenomenal guy, really. And we just go around with him.
00:33:26.80 --> 00:33:33.44 So, we ever got yelled at. My team leader was, was a cook, sergeant rush. Like, if we ever got yelled at,
00:33:33.44 --> 00:33:36.40 he just go with a kernel. But like, hey, so they're bothering us in the kernel. But like, don't
00:33:36.40 --> 00:33:40.64 do the doctor, my guys. I'm like, this is so nice being protected. I literally occur in our
00:33:40.64 --> 00:33:45.28 house. So that was a relatively cush. And you were living on a, if you're, if you're the kernel, I'm assuming
00:33:45.28 --> 00:33:49.92 you were living in like pretty good. Fob's learned. Oh, yeah. And they have like hard buildings on the head tents.
00:33:49.92 --> 00:33:56.000 We were in the very first hard building. Oh, we all went in and bought satellite internet. I had a shower
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000 every day. Hot meals. How often are you rolling out in the town? Every day. Okay. But we go out to
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.44 government work and come back. Okay. You know, and that was in the gym. I'd go at eight
00:34:05.44 --> 00:34:09.28 clock. I don't like being the gym with people. I got was like, I don't know, I'm in my machines.
00:34:09.28 --> 00:34:13.84 And I super said it a lot. So I go from eight to 11 at night, just crush it and then midnight
00:34:13.84 --> 00:34:19.12 child, which is like the greatest thing ever. No crowd. Oh, you just, you're like, I was like, I'm
00:34:19.12 --> 00:34:25.44 let's air in hot wings. You know, you get the combo breakfast and dinner scenario going down. I know
00:34:25.44 --> 00:34:29.92 you're a much cooler guy than me, but when you get the midnight child of five, so I'm sorry. So I
00:34:29.92 --> 00:34:35.92 went to the hot wings. I'll take pancakes and. And I want to show some mashed potatoes and
00:34:35.92 --> 00:34:42.96 just go around that. And you guys, it sounds like on that first of all, you didn't, you didn't even
00:34:42.96 --> 00:34:48.24 shoot. You even shoot your gun first. I didn't have to. I was on patrols every day. I had a suicide
00:34:48.24 --> 00:34:53.04 bomber run off the bus and like detonate on the front of our truck. It's just like an idiot.
00:34:53.04 --> 00:34:58.000 You know, not even like, you know, it's nutsax hanging off the light and is, you know, but he's just
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.96 the truck's not hurting. It's like genius bro. Genius job well done. A for effort. Yeah. Like a
00:35:04.96 --> 00:35:12.08 effort judgment. Yeah. Yeah. But still, that, I mean, that that having a suicide bomber hit your truck,
00:35:13.84 --> 00:35:18.32 that's like a, that's at least a reality check out a minimum. Right. Well, I mean, yeah, so it was, it was
00:35:18.32 --> 00:35:24.08 our, our, one of our, our front trucks. And then also we had a guy run up on the Colonel,
00:35:24.08 --> 00:35:30.000 open in the hospital and detonate himself. I was in the truck at that time like in the gun. But we just found
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000 out if we go out there, we just make sure they're right now. We're really aware every time we take a turn,
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.12 you know, our guns are rotating. We're not sleeping. We're up and out. We didn't really get messed with.
00:35:39.12 --> 00:35:45.52 And that, and that helped. I mean, I was, you know, I was in a place where there was bombs and things
00:35:45.52 --> 00:35:49.52 like that. But I was protected. You know, EOD would roll out before the Colonel went anywhere.
00:35:49.52 --> 00:35:55.12 Oh, that's right. Yeah. How many gun trucks did you take on a convoy? Just the coral.
00:35:55.12 --> 00:35:59.04 Just four of us. Would him and the three truck or two truck? He was in the two. I was just
00:35:59.04 --> 00:36:06.80 around at the first like six months. Nice. And then I was a, I moved to like be a TC. But the threat level was
00:36:06.80 --> 00:36:11.60 like medium. I mean, because you have to take a, yeah, you take a bigger convoy with more aggressive
00:36:12.56 --> 00:36:17.92 facilities. If I was in the home, it was at all homies. We were for like any other year. And I had a two
00:36:17.92 --> 00:36:23.04 four nine, like, as my, my main weapon had a saw. They're like, yeah, okay, the front truck, yep, 50
00:36:23.04 --> 00:36:28.72 kilo. A back truck, we're going to give you a mark. And you're just going to get a saw. That was like, oh,
00:36:28.72 --> 00:36:34.32 awesome. Thank you. So I had, I had a saw. That's what I put it up there. Like it was a big old gun.
00:36:35.20 --> 00:36:39.52 Yeah. That's awesome. Good times. Yeah. Why didn't they give you a real gun up there?
00:36:40.08 --> 00:36:44.000 Uh, I'm really the, my boss were big enough. I was a real gun show.
00:36:45.20 --> 00:36:50.48 You know, I did not get that. I had 22 at the time. I got some supplements sent to the
00:36:50.48 --> 00:36:54.80 reason. That's that guy's found away from me to get some of their supplements. Wonderful.
00:36:56.56 --> 00:37:02.16 Uh, now, do you want to, for, is this this is the, this is the, you went for home for Aronaran.
00:37:02.72 --> 00:37:07.60 It is. And you had your first meeting. First meeting with one of your
00:37:07.60 --> 00:37:13.04 pertainmates, sisters. You know, I loved it. I loved it. And I got a my space frame request.
00:37:13.68 --> 00:37:19.04 And I thought, I mean, this must be a dating page. It was a, you know, Calgirl hat, brown,
00:37:19.04 --> 00:37:23.76 blouse for whatever gene skirt. I was like, that's a dating site. You know, this is an ad way to
00:37:23.76 --> 00:37:28.32 second. That last name is my medic. Let's do some investigation. He was home on Aronar.
00:37:29.12 --> 00:37:32.72 And I was looking through. I was like, that's his little sister. She's 18. So it's legal.
00:37:32.72 --> 00:37:38.08 And I was just like, except, you know, and we started chitchat. And I just did to make him mad,
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:41.76 you know, but we ended up enjoying the show as a company. And first time we ever met, I was like,
00:37:41.76 --> 00:37:45.92 I just a revocation. I've been here 11 and a half months. You know, I got coming home for
00:37:45.92 --> 00:37:51.12 for 18 days. You want to go on vacation? She's like, yeah, sure. So just I were going to go to
00:37:51.12 --> 00:37:57.28 Cosmo Mexico. How do you, how do you talk to her dad into that? She was 18. So she did what she wanted.
00:37:57.28 --> 00:38:02.80 Yes, I don't know. He didn't kill me. So, head in. Every right. And so you go to Mexico. It's your first
00:38:02.80 --> 00:38:06.88 date. So that's how I'm just going to take you to Mexico. Yeah. Yeah. You guys, I say I don't know that's
00:38:06.88 --> 00:38:12.16 24,000 dollars when I know exactly where I went to Mexico that back to Michigan for a week.
00:38:12.16 --> 00:38:17.12 I had a great time. She went back to Texas, had to go back overseas. I got held up in Atlanta.
00:38:17.12 --> 00:38:20.32 So I called her up. I was like, hey, I'm in Atlanta for the night you want to come. She said, yeah,
00:38:20.32 --> 00:38:24.48 so she came out next morning, Santa Claus crock it out to your streaming from her face.
00:38:25.52 --> 00:38:28.24 And she's like, I love you. And I'm like, I don't know where to get. So I love you too.
00:38:28.24 --> 00:38:33.04 Yeah, it's fast. I love you. I didn't pause. You know, and she's like, in between her sauce,
00:38:33.04 --> 00:38:36.88 I want to marry you. And I'm like, yeah, I get that. But you know, in my head, I said that
00:38:36.88 --> 00:38:42.96 because I was like, I want to marry you too. We're all castin' over here. Jump on that airplane,
00:38:42.96 --> 00:38:46.48 get back overseas, give her a call, right 24 hours later, and have a chance to end. I'm like, hey,
00:38:46.48 --> 00:38:50.40 what's going on, baby? She's like, guess what? I'm like, I don't know what. Weddings planned.
00:38:53.52 --> 00:38:59.36 Sales.com, butter ring, colder dad and whatnot. You know, I guess that's cool. I'm like, well,
00:38:59.36 --> 00:39:05.20 okay, thanks. Yeah. And then we got married. How did her brother feel about you? Was her brother
00:39:05.20 --> 00:39:09.28 in your photo? I was using my medic. Yeah. He actually wrote in the same truck as me. Oh,
00:39:09.28 --> 00:39:13.28 in my current, I would pick on him on the radio. Hey, buck, what do you think? Meals doing with your
00:39:13.28 --> 00:39:18.24 sister. I was like, I'm like, break my break. You can let that go. Because you mean, I'm standing
00:39:18.24 --> 00:39:22.16 up in the truck, you know, Josh can just, yeah, hand me the back seat and I'm like, no, no,
00:39:22.16 --> 00:39:28.24 don't do this. Don't do this, sir. But, nah, he can't hear us. Good guy. He's like, he told
00:39:28.24 --> 00:39:32.08 his mom a day, he's like, look, I know how it looks. He's actually a good guy and really nice. So,
00:39:32.08 --> 00:39:36.000 we'll see how it works out. And then I ended up marrying her. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's awesome, man. That's
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.72 that's a great story to detail it in here that it's pretty, it's pretty unbelievable. You know,
00:39:44.72 --> 00:39:50.80 that you pulled all that off. Well, and the current was actually setting me up to go to the prep school
00:39:50.80 --> 00:39:55.04 engineer for West Point. He's like, usually we play in football on my, my lieutenant at the time.
00:39:56.40 --> 00:40:00.64 Lieutenant Philips, Tommy's a major, but maybe he's a Colonel now, but he was training me. He was
00:40:00.64 --> 00:40:05.60 football coach and he holds a record in Chicago. Yeah. Most consecutive losses at the school
00:40:05.60 --> 00:40:10.40 because he was coaching that in high school. Yeah, they were that bad. Great guy though. He was like,
00:40:10.40 --> 00:40:14.64 helping me coach and train up and lift weights and do whatever. But then I'm at Kelsey. I was like,
00:40:14.64 --> 00:40:20.88 I'm just going to do this. You know, so we got married. My God, back. How long after you went home
00:40:20.88 --> 00:40:26.56 for Christmas did you come back? I came back in April on the 13th, night 14th morning and then you
00:40:26.56 --> 00:40:31.20 won't find it in my book, but we got married the courthouse on the 17th. There you go. Yeah. And then we got
00:40:31.20 --> 00:40:35.12 married again. Yeah, like a great wedding engineer. Like good old smithier. Like that money. Well,
00:40:35.12 --> 00:40:39.68 I needed to spend all my money. You know, I was like, I don't know how we get a house. I'm like,
00:40:40.24 --> 00:40:43.28 I'm like, look, we need to, I need that be a age for you to months that they were just
00:40:43.28 --> 00:40:49.04 damn wedding. You know, so we can go to your right. In Texas in McKinney, about 112 that day.
00:40:49.84 --> 00:40:55.44 And then you settled down. And now you now you know you're standing at the army. You're pretty,
00:40:55.44 --> 00:40:58.64 pretty much saying I'm saying the army at this point. Well, I mean, I really enjoyed it. I got
00:40:58.64 --> 00:41:03.28 moved around another unit when I got back because I had to go to like a line unit could be a PSD
00:41:03.28 --> 00:41:07.44 guy that's all I mean, I was up for it. I was like, this is awesome. But yeah, we got to have an
00:41:07.44 --> 00:41:13.84 apartment in North Carolina, uh, right outside Fort Bragg there, bought a dog, um, life was good and
00:41:13.84 --> 00:41:19.12 I figured military is doing well and then just kind of hung out for 15 months or 18 months before
00:41:19.12 --> 00:41:22.88 I deployed. That's what I was going to say. So it's 18 months between deployments for you.
00:41:22.88 --> 00:41:27.92 Uh, it was that you usually a year and three months. So like I went for 15 months. So they gave me 18
00:41:27.92 --> 00:41:33.60 months off. I went for a year. And then I then gave me 15 months off that I had to go again for my
00:41:33.60 --> 00:41:41.04 third. But I'm jumping ahead here. So you you get back over on deployment. Um, and this is, uh, this is
00:41:41.04 --> 00:41:46.72 like within days that you, you'll tighten me up on that. But one of your, one of your friends
00:41:46.72 --> 00:41:54.32 Tyler Juden is saying that right? Mm-hmm. He's uh, out on a mount patrol, IED hits the first vehicle.
00:41:54.32 --> 00:41:58.56 Then they get a small, small arms ambush and I'm going to the book here. Our guys needed to get the
00:41:58.56 --> 00:42:03.20 disabled vehicle out of the way. And while they worked toward this objective, Tyler sprinted up to a
00:42:03.20 --> 00:42:08.48 high site on a nearby hill and fired through some five to seven magazines to ammo protecting his
00:42:08.48 --> 00:42:13.60 soldiers below when the disabled truck was finally cleared Tyler Sprinter back to the truck.
00:42:13.60 --> 00:42:20.40 Well, the enemy had specifically targeted him. An RPG flew in and he was hit. They rushed him back
00:42:20.40 --> 00:42:26.000 to the hospital at the fob, but it was too late. Tyler died on the operating table.
00:42:27.52 --> 00:42:33.52 Fury rose up inside of me. I wanted to find whatever taliban savages did this to Tyler and shoot
00:42:33.52 --> 00:42:39.52 them in the face. Tyler was always cautious. He took his job extremely seriously and never made
00:42:39.52 --> 00:42:45.92 mistakes. There was no reason for him to die. He described to me once how he believed his job as a sniper
00:42:45.92 --> 00:42:52.48 ultimately saved innocent lives. He was putting into practice what he knew to be true. He was helping
00:42:52.48 --> 00:42:57.52 the world, not hindering it and he'd been trained to be one of the rough men who stands ready in the
00:42:57.52 --> 00:43:02.48 night, prepared to do his duty, prepared to visit violence on those who would do us harm.
00:43:02.48 --> 00:43:10.08 Tyler's death hit far too close to home and we don't need just arrived.
00:43:12.40 --> 00:43:14.72 So that's not a fun way to kick off the point.
00:43:14.72 --> 00:43:19.44 No, and I don't know if he experienced in your unit, but it seems like the guys get hit are the ones
00:43:19.44 --> 00:43:25.04 that you don't expect to ever hit. So Tyler was a year older than me. I respected him.
00:43:25.04 --> 00:43:29.44 I mean, it was crazy because a guy's year older, it's like, well, whatever, but he had such
00:43:29.44 --> 00:43:33.52 a professionalism about him and I looked up to him and tried to learn what I could from him.
00:43:33.52 --> 00:43:36.72 And he only had like a, he probably had an extra year and a half and the army then I did,
00:43:36.72 --> 00:43:42.48 but either way. And highly ranked sniper and he went up and just he didn't take bad shots.
00:43:42.48 --> 00:43:45.36 So he was just popping everybody and they did tie a rhythm. He actually,
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.56 I'm pretty sure was a camp champ and that he, that I'm not sure if you ever been to the SF.
00:43:50.56 --> 00:43:56.08 No, I have base there. Anyway, that's where you ended up not making. There's only two weeks
00:43:56.08 --> 00:44:00.56 into the point of that. And you know, when that guy like that gets hit, one,
00:44:00.56 --> 00:44:03.04 obviously frustrated and angry, you don't know why it happened, but two, it's like,
00:44:03.68 --> 00:44:08.64 well, geez, if he didn't get hit or taken out, you know, it kind of takes you down to confidence
00:44:08.64 --> 00:44:14.24 a pegrot, pegrot too as well because he's a guy you wouldn't expect. Not that you expect anybody
00:44:14.24 --> 00:44:20.32 to hit, I guess. But you know, like a super soldier style guy. Yeah, and I'm sure like,
00:44:20.32 --> 00:44:26.24 everybody, if you held him in that regard, everybody held him in that regard. And so everybody's
00:44:26.24 --> 00:44:33.04 feeling that same, oh, yeah. Kind of straight up nervousness, right? Yeah. And there was, he would walk by,
00:44:33.04 --> 00:44:37.12 like on our ACUs, like we have a strange post tucked a string in, some standard stuff.
00:44:37.12 --> 00:44:41.76 If my way would be hanging out, he'd walk by and hang on it and they make me do push ups and yell at me.
00:44:42.16 --> 00:44:46.08 And I wanted to punch him in the face, but I couldn't, you know, and I understood why he was doing it.
00:44:46.08 --> 00:44:50.72 So, I just had fun story, I guess I'd tell people because I mean, if I could have decked in my pride,
00:44:50.72 --> 00:44:55.68 what? I've only been in one fistfight ever, I knocked myself out, playing volleyball.
00:44:56.72 --> 00:45:00.64 Tells it, that was the one. Yeah. It's sad, but true, it's in the book.
00:45:02.48 --> 00:45:05.68 I don't know what that. Really, you might as well tell it.
00:45:05.68 --> 00:45:09.04 Well, yeah, we were just playing volleyball and I forgot, man, I was going over the net. We made
00:45:09.04 --> 00:45:15.28 a wee 2-5-4 cables for the antennas we used those in 550 cord and it was like,
00:45:15.28 --> 00:45:18.24 good girl, we're net. I was 6 foot 3 and the net was only 6 foot tall, so I was like,
00:45:18.24 --> 00:45:23.84 just hammering it home and I had a vertical, you know, like the bronze. So, he's ridiculous,
00:45:24.40 --> 00:45:28.64 a whole belly button above the net and I kept going over and they kept yelling. So I pulled my
00:45:28.64 --> 00:45:34.000 hand back real fast, and I caught myself right in the eye socket. Knocked out.
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.44 Do you actually knock yourself out? Yeah. But later on, when I had this happen, I did get knocked
00:45:41.44 --> 00:45:44.88 out. Yeah, that's like, keep imagine when the fist of fury could have done.
00:45:45.76 --> 00:45:50.000 Floyd Winner stood at chance against me. I don't know if I'm impressed if that's like super impressive
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.56 or super not impressive. Right. You either have the fist of iron or a glass jaw. We're not sure
00:45:54.56 --> 00:45:59.04 which. I hit a bomb. Yeah. And I didn't get knocked out, so my answer has been fist of iron. Yeah,
00:45:59.04 --> 00:46:03.92 the questions have been answered. Probably being jail right now, if I was, went fist of cuffs,
00:46:03.92 --> 00:46:14.64 anybody. So, you, it sounds like, you guys ended up doing overwatches of a road in, um,
00:46:14.64 --> 00:46:21.52 what, up by, Zobsick Pass. Okay. Yeah. And, great time. How long were you on that for?
00:46:21.52 --> 00:46:24.72 Well, we went out there and they were like, yeah, just go ahead and pack for a couple of weeks
00:46:24.72 --> 00:46:29.36 and then we were out there. I think 50, 50 days or so. And we just live on top of a mountain
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.44 and then like just monitoring the road. Yeah, just because they had, uh, they were bringing
00:46:33.44 --> 00:46:39.28 up convoy's and jingle trucks with military gear on to build another fob. And we had people on both
00:46:39.28 --> 00:46:44.80 sides and I actually, uh, a sofa ready to tell my wife I, I went down one day to get some food
00:46:44.80 --> 00:46:50.000 or something or get a resupply. And, uh, I'm going back up. They made a stop. They want to register
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.60 mortars. And I was like, what the, I just want to get back up there. I got out and I slammed my door
00:46:53.60 --> 00:46:57.52 and like the brilliant guy, I went ahead and used a fist if he had a hammer to hummer.
00:46:58.24 --> 00:47:02.08 And I ripped a scab open on my hand. I told the way my story to my wife. It was
00:47:02.08 --> 00:47:06.32 somewhat blood. It was gushing as ridiculous. But, uh, as my wedding ring fingers, I took my
00:47:06.32 --> 00:47:09.92 wedding ring off put on the front of the hummer and I got the medic guys to get out of your
00:47:09.92 --> 00:47:14.56 dock, you know, willis or whatever. I fixed this up for me and I had to put tape on. I got back in,
00:47:14.56 --> 00:47:18.24 left my wedding ring right on the front of that hummer and drove back out mountain. So, like,
00:47:18.24 --> 00:47:21.60 for 30, some days every time I got a chance to go down the mountain, I had a middle,
00:47:21.60 --> 00:47:24.56 the zector out like, please find this tungsten ring. Please, I don't want to tell my wife.
00:47:25.20 --> 00:47:34.32 I never heard of it. I was like to give people that didn't serve a little, you know,
00:47:34.32 --> 00:47:38.72 impression or of what it's like and I thought this wouldn't wrap that up pretty good.
00:47:38.72 --> 00:47:44.16 Going to the book here, going so long without taking a shower, came with a chair of complications.
00:47:44.16 --> 00:47:48.72 Guys got transferred from their feet being wet and sweaty and not taking care of them properly.
00:47:48.72 --> 00:47:53.12 I got strange rashes and intimate areas and it wasn't uncommon for a guy to
00:47:53.12 --> 00:47:59.12 mutter about his balls sticking to his leg when he hiked. Every dude got chafed up pretty badly
00:47:59.12 --> 00:48:06.40 in his bodily crevices and a common complaint was that a guy had swass slank for sweaty ass.
00:48:07.76 --> 00:48:14.80 My armpits hurt. I swed it so much that the salt got trapped in my skin and my back broke out
00:48:14.80 --> 00:48:21.76 in a raised bubbly rash. This happened to other guys too. The only solution is to get your ID card out
00:48:21.76 --> 00:48:26.000 and have another dude scrape your back hard until the salt crystals pop out.
00:48:27.04 --> 00:48:32.40 It's a brutal procedure and it feels like getting cut with a razor blade, but it's all part of the
00:48:32.40 --> 00:48:41.20 fun. Yeah. Day to day. Yeah. Day to day get something. I mean, sounds like I was complaining
00:48:41.20 --> 00:48:47.20 in that one. No. Yeah, watching someone like scrape salt crystals, like size of table salt
00:48:47.20 --> 00:48:51.84 come out. I'm not sure if you ever experienced it like that. No. But yeah, it's pretty bad and you
00:48:51.84 --> 00:48:56.80 get so grow. And then I took four real showers that year. Yeah. Like real ones. I mean, you
00:48:56.80 --> 00:49:00.64 go get a water bottle, poke holes in the top and spray yourself down. Then you have to get dirty
00:49:00.64 --> 00:49:04.72 all over again. It's just a long process. So you started to think of like how it takes like
00:49:04.72 --> 00:49:09.04 nine days or something for you get comfortable with your nasties. Yeah. And then you don't even
00:49:09.04 --> 00:49:12.40 want to break the cycle and get cleaning your skin. You know, you know, you need to use dirty
00:49:12.40 --> 00:49:16.64 skin? No. The best part is like the winner because you don't smell as bad in the winter. Like
00:49:16.64 --> 00:49:20.08 when the winter you don't take showers like, oh, it doesn't matter. I brushed my teeth keeping
00:49:20.08 --> 00:49:26.000 perley white. Maybe I teeth look wider. You know. But yeah, and I was pretty I actually decided
00:49:27.52 --> 00:49:32.32 halfway into that point. I was like, oh my wife just sent me eight pair of range of panties. So I
00:49:32.32 --> 00:49:36.16 wore a whole pair like range of panties for a month. And I just took them off. I was like, no,
00:49:36.16 --> 00:49:40.72 I'm not going to wash these. Just don't worry. Except it and move on 12 bucks, well spent.
00:49:41.52 --> 00:49:47.68 So my effect, whereas the obzack passed my pants got so torn. They were like chaps. Like
00:49:47.68 --> 00:49:50.96 my butt cheeks were hanging out. So I went these sergeant majors came in. You know, and they're
00:49:50.96 --> 00:49:55.92 all out of shape. Like, you already don't look back at dips. I know, I changed pants. I'm like
00:49:55.92 --> 00:49:59.04 sergeant major, if I change the pants, I'm like another pair of looks just like this. Like,
00:49:59.04 --> 00:50:03.12 it's that I'm not on the fob. There's you come into like, you got to get in the uniform and
00:50:03.12 --> 00:50:08.72 all that. I'm like, bring me one. I'm like, yeah, okay, let me do that. You got it, bud. I know you're
00:50:08.72 --> 00:50:13.36 going to get back in that truck and roll your ass out of here. So back to the chicken wings and
00:50:13.36 --> 00:50:22.80 pancakes. Oh, I know. A lot of MREs. That's good times. Yeah, you know, I got to just straight up.
00:50:22.80 --> 00:50:30.32 I mean, in the sealed teams, we just don't have to eat that many MREs. That's the way it is.
00:50:30.32 --> 00:50:35.04 Yeah, to the either you make them, you can make those things delicious. Yeah, you can.
00:50:35.04 --> 00:50:43.44 That burrito. Get at me. Mixed a little bit in there. Yeah. I actually, my first deployment
00:50:43.44 --> 00:50:48.72 to Iraq, we ate MREs for a little while, and I was legitimately sick of them. And it was, it wasn't
00:50:48.72 --> 00:50:53.12 that long. But I was already sick of them. One, no, 50 days. I can promise you that.
00:50:53.52 --> 00:50:58.08 Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah. Yeah. You're just going to say something about the sealed
00:50:58.08 --> 00:51:02.64 teams. Why don't you? No, I would never. I don't have this period of
00:51:02.64 --> 00:51:07.84 spending myself. We're getting shipped in stakes. I'm like that. I mean, later on,
00:51:07.84 --> 00:51:11.44 that point, we had like stakes on like one day a week, they'd bring out like these frozen
00:51:11.44 --> 00:51:17.12 stakes. We could come over like an open pit of fire with a stick thrown. Yeah. Dude, it is legit.
00:51:17.12 --> 00:51:20.24 Like, I would go out to some rant. My first point, we'd go out to, because we were living
00:51:20.24 --> 00:51:24.88 at weird owned by, up and back, dad, big, jow haul, everything good. And we'd go out to
00:51:24.88 --> 00:51:30.40 do an op somewhere. There'd be some SF group in the middle of nowhere. And you'd see how
00:51:30.40 --> 00:51:34.000 they're living. I mean, it wasn't always an SF group. Some of us are, you know, some army
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.12 platoon or company out there in the middle of nowhere. And you're like, dang, these boys are
00:51:37.12 --> 00:51:42.000 roughing it nasty. And we're here like, they brought Gatorade, they brought a case. Yeah, I
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.68 gave me two. Give me two on the hide one of my pillow case. You'd feel bad. They'd
00:51:45.68 --> 00:51:49.12 go, oh, man, you're in the sealed teams. You're like, dude, I'm ashamed to do like, even
00:51:49.12 --> 00:51:52.96 be hanging out with you right now. You guys smell so bad. I don't know why they brought me out.
00:51:52.96 --> 00:51:57.04 Yeah. You guys go sit over there. We're just going to sit here. Leave this alone. We need
00:51:57.04 --> 00:52:01.68 you guys. Yeah. Do you know what? We've gone three days without a shower. This is crap, man.
00:52:03.52 --> 00:52:09.68 Yeah, we did that. It's totally the same life. But, you know, within during the, I mean,
00:52:10.24 --> 00:52:14.24 in during the soccer. It's still like, it's funny, like, my friend from high school, right?
00:52:14.88 --> 00:52:18.88 I have two really good friends I can talk with, whatever. But if I run to another person from high
00:52:18.88 --> 00:52:23.28 school or whatever, we'll catch up on everything. That's like, oh, great talking to you.
00:52:23.28 --> 00:52:26.48 You know, and then you find your way out of conversation, but you, friend, a military buddy,
00:52:26.48 --> 00:52:29.84 you haven't seen in years and you just go right back into it. You know, just because you
00:52:29.84 --> 00:52:31.92 understand where you've been with me. Yeah. Yeah.
00:52:34.08 --> 00:52:38.72 Speaking of going through stuff, here we go. Back to the book, the Taliban
00:52:38.72 --> 00:52:43.04 screech to a stop and started shooting at the AMP bullets cracked all around us. We got
00:52:43.04 --> 00:52:49.44 word from higher command to engage. I yelled to my men fire. We shot our rifles and shorts let loose
00:52:49.44 --> 00:52:54.96 with several bursts of machine gun, rat a tat, rat a tat, rat a tat, rat a tat tat.
00:52:55.68 --> 00:53:01.36 This is my first large scale firefight of any kind. It hit me with a wham that this wasn't
00:53:01.36 --> 00:53:05.92 really a training exercise anymore. This was the real deal. My adrenaline rose in where
00:53:05.92 --> 00:53:12.32 the surge of energy. But I also felt calm as if all my training kicked in at once. And I just did
00:53:12.32 --> 00:53:18.40 what I was trained to do. I honestly wasn't afraid. I took aim and fired at the bad guys. They
00:53:18.40 --> 00:53:22.56 fired at me and it didn't phase me to think that I might kill somebody when I wanted when they
00:53:22.56 --> 00:53:28.80 wanted to kill me first. I saw several Taliban members get hit and fall more fell and more.
00:53:29.52 --> 00:53:36.08 The last few who are left turned around and took off took off the waddy. We got word to get
00:53:36.08 --> 00:53:40.24 not to give chase because waddy's are great choke points for potential enemy ambushes.
00:53:40.24 --> 00:53:45.28 When the shooting died down completely we approached close enough to see the bodies of the
00:53:45.28 --> 00:53:51.28 enemy soldiers. I just helped kill. It was a surreal feeling but I reminded myself that this is
00:53:51.28 --> 00:53:58.08 what a soldiers are built to do. We received reports later that three of my men, the three of the men
00:53:58.72 --> 00:54:04.64 killed or top Taliban leaders in the region. So there's your first gunfight. Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
00:54:04.64 --> 00:54:11.28 So the A&P commander was a former Taliban guy. He switched over sides and ran around the
00:54:11.28 --> 00:54:14.24 A&P. He was like, yeah they're having a big meeting. I got a call. They're kind of coming
00:54:14.24 --> 00:54:19.52 on this waddy. We'll go check it out and then all of a sudden just drop in, you know, Martin 19
00:54:19.52 --> 00:54:27.12 and the 50 cal into 40 on him and just hey, you know, going nuts and then they come back and
00:54:27.12 --> 00:54:31.12 they're really good about taking their bodies away with them. They're pretty good about it but they
00:54:31.12 --> 00:54:38.08 were like 18 or 20 people deep in the in the waddy coming and we just led into them. And yeah, that was
00:54:38.08 --> 00:54:42.64 my first like real taste of like I shoot my gun at people. What were your team leader at this point?
00:54:43.36 --> 00:54:49.60 No, I was so I was actually a squad leader. I was I was a position up. So I was still in E5 but I was
00:54:49.60 --> 00:54:55.84 in a squad leader position. So I was tried to do a what a weapon squad? No, no, that we were actually
00:54:55.84 --> 00:55:00.24 we were mounted. Okay. So I had my own truck but I had two trucks that were under me. So I had two
00:55:01.28 --> 00:55:05.68 two trucks that were two teams. I had two team leaders that were underneath me and then we
00:55:05.68 --> 00:55:10.08 had a truck. So my senior like team leader had one, he was a T.C. of his truck man. I was a T.C.
00:55:10.08 --> 00:55:17.44 of the junior team leader that. Yeah. So it was a good time. Again, I said that. I'll speak in
00:55:17.44 --> 00:55:21.28 somewhere the other day and I said something along those lines and like somebody said like,
00:55:21.28 --> 00:55:25.84 I think it's kind of weird that you say it's a good time and fun and I'm like, well,
00:55:26.64 --> 00:55:29.52 it's a drilling rush. Not going to get it. It's a good time and fun. I mean,
00:55:30.80 --> 00:55:39.28 they shot at me first. I mean, he started it. It's starting. Yeah, the fender self. But uh, yeah.
00:55:39.28 --> 00:55:45.12 And then I mean, yeah, it just doesn't, it didn't phase me. It didn't hit me hard. I wasn't
00:55:45.12 --> 00:55:51.92 worried about it. Um, just kept moving on. In fact, that region died right down like completely after
00:55:51.92 --> 00:55:56.16 this. Well, if you kill all those bad guys, it's just, yeah, it's just in fact. Like, uh, that was our
00:55:56.16 --> 00:55:59.84 first night out there too. Like, moved out to the middle of nowhere in the snowstorm and that was like,
00:55:59.84 --> 00:56:03.84 maybe I'm not first night or second night out there. We just shot everybody and then for the next
00:56:03.84 --> 00:56:06.64 like two months, it was quiet and they were like, they back filled us with some other
00:56:07.20 --> 00:56:10.40 patoon. And like, hey, we're going to bring in this patoon here. You guys are going to go up north
00:56:10.40 --> 00:56:15.04 where there's a lot of fighting in Baltimore. God. All right, cool. Let's do it. So that's that's the next
00:56:15.04 --> 00:56:21.60 big movement that you made. Who is that spot? And that place had a bad rep, like, as far as being
00:56:21.60 --> 00:56:26.000 a lot of fighting there. Uh, Obama guy was really heavy. Really heavy. It was, um, the Obama guy
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.84 of River. And when we got there, um, the Italians were there before us. And I guess they were just like,
00:56:31.84 --> 00:56:35.84 hey, tell me, don't mess with us. Here's, here's some money and we're good. And we're, uh, where
00:56:35.84 --> 00:56:41.76 the eight seconds. So we're like, no, not going to happen. And the infantry, between that we replaced,
00:56:41.76 --> 00:56:45.20 and I mean, for the record, I am infantry. I was in a cab unit, but they always have a
00:56:45.20 --> 00:56:49.84 trolley troop is infantry, but soon they bring in. And then we had these coin between us. I was
00:56:49.84 --> 00:56:55.28 like two infantry and two cab squads to make the tunes up. But um, yeah, we replaced these, uh, the
00:56:55.28 --> 00:56:58.56 infantry guys, they had two guys killed. Unfortunately, fell into a river. There was actually a
00:56:58.56 --> 00:57:04.16 ceasefire with a tail band to find the bodies and bring the bodies back. Um, and we got up there
00:57:04.16 --> 00:57:09.20 and there was like a line in the sand. They said, look, you cross this line. You're going to get shot at.
00:57:09.20 --> 00:57:16.72 And we were like, all right, cool. So we started taking ground. And um, everywhere, there's a
00:57:16.72 --> 00:57:21.04 fighting position on top of a mountain. They would booby trap it when they were done. So a guy, one of
00:57:21.04 --> 00:57:25.92 the F.O.s sergeant Fox, good guy, he picked up a matchbox and he said, yep, I got a matchbox. It
00:57:25.92 --> 00:57:30.32 looks like, and then just they only found his torso. That was, you know, everything else was gone.
00:57:30.32 --> 00:57:37.36 Just his body armor. Um, but instead of staying in one spot at this one, we took one more spot.
00:57:37.36 --> 00:57:43.84 And they're like, yeah, well, some Marciac guys went up here. Was this the, uh, was these the strong points
00:57:43.84 --> 00:57:49.12 like Corvette and Impala? Is that what we're talking about now? Yeah. Yeah. These are in your book.
00:57:49.12 --> 00:57:54.56 Um, you talk about those being an Impala was the, the even worst one, even further
00:57:54.56 --> 00:57:58.32 than animatariory. Yeah, and they were like, yeah, we had like a Marciac guy got shot in the head
00:57:58.32 --> 00:58:02.72 when he was up there. Um, it was just like a eight man team that went in and they're like,
00:58:02.72 --> 00:58:05.76 you guys can't really go there. So we decided one night, we're going to go there. We'd
00:58:05.76 --> 00:58:11.36 drink, we've got already for it. What was Impala physically? What is it like a little, uh,
00:58:11.36 --> 00:58:17.28 former like like house or something? There's actually absolutely there's a house. Um, and we
00:58:17.28 --> 00:58:20.56 decided we're going to take it one night because there was a last house in the edge of town. And then
00:58:20.56 --> 00:58:24.88 there was 1200 meters between the next like village. And the Taliban would go in there and shoot
00:58:24.88 --> 00:58:32.24 it us and, you know, be able to sneak down a way far enough. And, uh, we had a javlin team come up
00:58:32.24 --> 00:58:35.92 on one side. We, we went up in the middle of night on this side. And we had other people on this side.
00:58:35.92 --> 00:58:40.96 And we just, we just took it, uh, middle of a night. And then they were said we're going to go there
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:44.24 for like, you know, three days, do reconnaissance come back and they're like, you know what we're going to
00:58:44.24 --> 00:58:50.32 say there. So the worked in stop. We had a Phil Samvags put up barbed wire, um, and then we went
00:58:50.32 --> 00:58:58.40 up the side of a mountain and dug in a, um, an OP, but it was like we, we had 21 guys or a Taliban never
00:58:58.40 --> 00:59:04.32 knew. We only had 20, 20, uh, one man puttune. So we had like 13 down at the cop and then we sent the
00:59:04.32 --> 00:59:08.48 rest of them up on top of the hill. And we dug in. So deep that was eight foot deep pits and there
00:59:08.48 --> 00:59:15.36 was a living room, uh, two, 40 pit, a 50 cow pit, um, uh, like a little dying kitchen area and then
00:59:15.36 --> 00:59:19.44 like three sleeping pits, like three like that two cops would fit in. Like it was huge. Did you put
00:59:19.44 --> 00:59:23.76 overhead cover on them somehow? Uh, no, we just dug them deep enough where you didn't didn't. Yeah,
00:59:23.76 --> 00:59:28.96 I mean, we put, I guess we put our, um, ponchos over it, you know, things like that. But not protection
00:59:28.96 --> 00:59:33.92 from mortars. No, no, uh, and if you stood up when they were digging it and they started digging it
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:40.48 when you stood up and you were digging, they started shooting us and then we just ran hell and, um,
00:59:40.48 --> 00:59:44.48 we dug in after about a month of that. We just were telling so many they just gave it up. They're like,
00:59:44.48 --> 00:59:50.24 all right, we're done. Um, and that's where we, I mean, we came out, we were black on water and then
00:59:50.24 --> 00:59:54.96 like the brass came out. They're like, what, you got shaving? Where's your haircut? So I'm like,
00:59:54.96 --> 00:59:59.52 hey, we didn't have water. Are you kidding around? Oh, bro? And then it's same-starred to me,
00:59:59.52 --> 01:00:04.40 yellowed for my pants. They wanted to go up to CRLP. So my two sergeants, I, hey, sergeant
01:00:04.40 --> 01:00:08.16 mills, I need you to, can you take one of your teams and just go through took four men out. And I
01:00:08.16 --> 01:00:12.000 walked them right over, what I thought the road was clear, you know, but it was all filled with water
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.24 when we took the place. Walk more huge ideas. They just, the batteries had died in them because they
01:00:16.24 --> 01:00:19.68 waited, you know, we waited too long. But when they'd dried up, they're like, oh, there's a mortar. Oh,
01:00:19.68 --> 01:00:24.80 look at that. That's a, that's a AT mine and triple stack, you know. Um, but anyways, so I was like
01:00:24.80 --> 01:00:28.08 talking about on top of the OP and stuff like that. And it was funny because as they're yelling
01:00:28.08 --> 01:00:32.40 this for not being shaving or cleaned up, I go a quarter of the way up. This is like a hundred
01:00:32.40 --> 01:00:37.36 yards probably. Like I'm a straight up. And I go up a quarter the way with them and I say, all right,
01:00:37.36 --> 01:00:41.92 I'll be right back. So I run to the top and I'd say, hey, L.T., you know, the sergeant major is coming
01:00:41.92 --> 01:00:45.84 up in the kernel. So it'd just be really, you know, so we're like trying to put our uniforms on and everything
01:00:45.84 --> 01:00:49.44 and said like just our t-shirts. And I run back down and he's bare crawling. He said,
01:00:49.44 --> 01:00:53.28 sounds like I can't do it. I don't like go with your midnight child. Needless alone. How about that?
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.04 There you can.
01:00:55.68 --> 01:01:01.20 Got a suit, huh? But he'd make it to the OP. He made it up to the top. He did eventually. And I'm like,
01:01:01.20 --> 01:01:05.04 but I came back down. I kind of put a little bit of fear in him. I said, sergeant major, this is not
01:01:05.04 --> 01:01:08.64 the spot that you want to stop right there that town that's tail of handheld. Anybody in that town
01:01:08.64 --> 01:01:13.60 shoots at us? And if they see that we're not moving quick, they're going to take pop shots. So you're
01:01:13.60 --> 01:01:18.000 going to need to, yeah, I mean, mostly true. Yeah. He was like sitting down looking and I was like,
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000 no, no, no, no, you need to need to move. So I just need to go. I mean, and no, thanks to the brass.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.28 It wasn't even my sergeant major. I don't think that was there at the time. It was like a different
01:01:27.68 --> 01:01:33.36 unit or whatever. But yeah, I mean, it was a wild, wild last. We were just shooting firefights every
01:01:33.36 --> 01:01:37.36 day, but we were the northern limit. You know, there was no buddy farther pushing us. Pushed
01:01:37.36 --> 01:01:43.52 to us. Yeah. I want one part you're talking about how you, you ended up shooting 11 javelins
01:01:43.52 --> 01:01:49.20 in a day. I think. Yeah. That's that's getting a half career on pretty much anyone's standards.
01:01:49.20 --> 01:01:55.52 Yeah. I think the shot 29 that hold the blame. It was just, it was cool. Damn.
01:01:57.04 --> 01:02:02.88 So you conventionally want me to be fun? Yeah. You're a job. Yeah. Do the conventional army
01:02:02.88 --> 01:02:08.32 were within Ramadi were freaking getting after every single day. They were awesome. Awesome.
01:02:11.52 --> 01:02:16.48 Like you were getting in a firefight every day there, huh? For a bit there, we were and then
01:02:16.48 --> 01:02:21.52 it died right down. They were just tired because once they shot once we just, we let loose.
01:02:21.52 --> 01:02:27.12 We had enough ammo to last us for a year's probably. And we let them know. We let them know.
01:02:27.12 --> 01:02:32.000 Yeah. America's real cool when it comes to ammo. Yeah. In the situation. It's like, oh,
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.12 you guys need more? Yeah. We'll be right there. All right. You are,
01:02:39.84 --> 01:02:44.56 yeah. Same thing happened. You were like, you were like, did you find, you found triple stacked
01:02:44.56 --> 01:02:50.88 IDs in your position? Yeah. So, dumbest thing. We went in and we cleared it. And then we had
01:02:50.88 --> 01:02:56.40 like Marines, EOD, like Marsak, EOD, clear stuff. Like there was like unexploded RPG around the
01:02:56.40 --> 01:03:00.80 side one of the walls. And then there was other booey traps. Well, turns out where we were
01:03:00.80 --> 01:03:05.04 rolling all of our, like, big barrels for the generator and stuff like that was like,
01:03:05.04 --> 01:03:09.04 it was all booey trap. Right? Where exactly were we step? And this guy started to Barton,
01:03:09.04 --> 01:03:12.72 he's a great guy. There's just met a lot of the ground. He's like, huh? What's that? It starts
01:03:12.72 --> 01:03:17.52 beating on it with a shovel. And I'm going, I'm getting ready to grow on my R&R. Oh, and you got
01:03:18.32 --> 01:03:22.64 tingling. What are you doing, dude? God. Something to ground here. Just looking, looking at it.
01:03:22.64 --> 01:03:26.88 He starts to dig in and I was like, oh, oh, that's not, oh shit. And then turns out where you're
01:03:26.88 --> 01:03:31.68 rolling these 50 gallon drums, taking all this supplies, right over top right in the breezeway.
01:03:31.68 --> 01:03:37.36 Good God. It's where I would, so it was so hot there. And I mean, I get I'm rags hot too, but
01:03:37.36 --> 01:03:42.56 it was so hot. Like me and my buddy, it was a one of my team leaders. We'd go out there and
01:03:42.56 --> 01:03:45.60 we'd spray ourselves with water. About being our PT short spray, so the water about land
01:03:45.60 --> 01:03:50.32 our cops and just see how long took the dry? Usually about 10 to 15 minutes to get completely dry.
01:03:50.32 --> 01:03:56.64 And our cops were right on top of these. And no idea. Because I mean, EOD came through and they
01:03:56.64 --> 01:04:01.36 didn't find it. So was he figured was like a command debt that had the battery died or something?
01:04:01.36 --> 01:04:07.76 Or it was a, yeah, well, it was pressure plates. Oh, my, so these big drums were having the
01:04:07.76 --> 01:04:11.76 circuit connect, but the batteries and I'm died. We, you know, luckily we didn't take the
01:04:11.76 --> 01:04:16.64 property to, you know, I'd like to, I think after the march, that guy's got it. They went in there
01:04:16.64 --> 01:04:20.64 and Boobey trapped it all knowing that we were trying to take it, but somehow the batteries didn't
01:04:20.64 --> 01:04:25.76 work, which helped out for us, because we jumped over a rock wall that they had, where there was
01:04:25.76 --> 01:04:30.80 like a hole in the wall, ready from probably a hellfire, so from time of four. So right where we,
01:04:30.80 --> 01:04:33.60 you know, obviously, be East Place President Trump over, that's what we all jumped over and there was
01:04:33.60 --> 01:04:41.12 stuff stacked there too. So it's where you talk about it in here. And I heard this from the Vietnam
01:04:41.12 --> 01:04:48.08 seals. They would set up ambushes on VC and they would, you know, go, okay, we're going to shoot
01:04:48.08 --> 01:04:51.36 from here and when we shoot from here, they're going to take cover over here behind this lock,
01:04:51.36 --> 01:04:56.72 so they'd put a big claim or underneath that lock. And you're talking about how the Taliban is doing
01:04:56.72 --> 01:05:01.12 the same thing over there, you know, basically, oh, as soon as we start shooting,
01:05:01.12 --> 01:05:04.88 now I'm going to run to these cover positions. So we'll just put Boobey traps in mines and any
01:05:04.88 --> 01:05:09.28 of these cover positions. Yeah, we actually had to change up our SOPs or standing out praying
01:05:09.28 --> 01:05:12.88 procedures on my third deployment instead of diving for cover, you've had to take a knee.
01:05:12.88 --> 01:05:16.64 Yeah, that's what I was reading and I was just, that's what reminded me of. I reminded me
01:05:16.64 --> 01:05:22.32 of that's what my predecessors and the seal teams and Vietnam would do to the enemy. And now
01:05:23.12 --> 01:05:29.68 the enemy was doing it to us or to you guys. Yeah, scary. This is this is an interesting spot.
01:05:29.68 --> 01:05:34.000 You're heading home from leave from there. I left in May and caught a series of connecting
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.72 flights home to America. I gave Kelsey a huge kiss at the airport and Dallas when I got back
01:05:38.72 --> 01:05:44.16 to the house gave her dog buddy a big hug. It felt great to be back, but it also felt surreal.
01:05:44.16 --> 01:05:48.80 And this is a strange part of this leave time. I didn't quite know what to do with myself.
01:05:49.36 --> 01:05:53.84 I could take a hot shower anytime I wanted. I could sit on the couch and play video games.
01:05:53.84 --> 01:05:57.28 I could drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger outside on the back porch.
01:05:57.92 --> 01:06:03.76 Nobody was shooting at me. Nobody's stunk. Nobody was sleeping on triple stacked IEDs.
01:06:04.96 --> 01:06:09.36 Kelsey was finishing up the semester with college and work, so I bought a truck and we drove
01:06:09.36 --> 01:06:13.44 up to Michigan to see my parents. We had a few bright and happy days with them,
01:06:13.44 --> 01:06:19.20 then it was soon time to go just like that. I hugged my parents, gave Kelsey a big kiss,
01:06:19.20 --> 01:06:25.52 and flew out to Detroit to head back overseas. It felt oddly good to be back to Afghanistan.
01:06:26.08 --> 01:06:30.80 The feeling is difficult to explain. In America, when I'd hung around with some friends and
01:06:30.80 --> 01:06:34.56 Dallas and got re-acquainted with some of my buddies from high school back in Michigan,
01:06:34.56 --> 01:06:41.60 I'd seen first-hand, how most of the people my age lived. If a dude was 22 or 23 like me,
01:06:41.60 --> 01:06:46.80 he was usually finishing up college or hanging out trying to find an internship or an entry-level job.
01:06:47.20 --> 01:06:51.84 He might be living in his parents' basement, trying to scrape together enough money to move out.
01:06:52.48 --> 01:06:56.16 Or maybe he was partying hard on weekends or maybe still in a frat.
01:06:57.28 --> 01:07:02.32 He was almost always short on money. Almost always wondering what to do with his future.
01:07:03.12 --> 01:07:06.80 Not that there was anything wrong with any of that. A guy's got to do what a guy's got to do,
01:07:06.80 --> 01:07:13.44 but by contrast, at my age in the military, I led people in combat. I controlled firefights.
01:07:13.44 --> 01:07:18.32 I handled hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. I made decisions that affected
01:07:18.32 --> 01:07:25.20 whether people would live or die. It felt real. On a personal level, I made decent money. I was
01:07:25.20 --> 01:07:30.72 married. I had a good credit score. I was thinking of buying a house soon. It felt good to be
01:07:30.72 --> 01:07:37.68 trusted with this much responsibility. I was proud of my drive and sense of accomplishment. I was already
01:07:37.68 --> 01:07:47.52 a man. I think statements like that are like what get kids or if I say kids, but like when I meet
01:07:47.52 --> 01:07:52.32 kids, like I've just met at this event, we were just at, and this, you know, he's like, I'm 19.
01:07:52.32 --> 01:07:56.64 I just joined the Marine Corps. I'm leaving September 18th. And that statement like that
01:07:56.64 --> 01:08:01.20 is what I think makes people join the military. It gets a lot of people to join the military.
01:08:01.20 --> 01:08:07.44 Like 22 years old. Oh, yeah. You get paid. You've got a steady job. Your job is more meaningful
01:08:07.44 --> 01:08:12.32 than any job they could have. I mean, never mind, maybe they're working at fast food, right?
01:08:12.32 --> 01:08:17.36 Like I did. You know, never mind that they're working at Wendy's. Even if they have a kick-ass
01:08:17.36 --> 01:08:20.56 job somewhere, it doesn't matter. Your job is more meaningful because you're a soldier fighting
01:08:20.56 --> 01:08:24.72 for freedom. Yeah, and they would, you know, you go back home and you see what they're doing.
01:08:24.72 --> 01:08:30.80 You're like, wow, my lots of change. And I'm like, I've been Afghanistan. I got married. I have an
01:08:30.80 --> 01:08:36.72 apartment. I, you know, I have two cars, whatever. And it's at that young stage. I mean, in my friends
01:08:36.72 --> 01:08:40.40 back home, they were still really nice and, you know, I still get along with them and everything.
01:08:40.40 --> 01:08:45.20 I just felt like what I was doing was was a different purpose. And I was trusted with more
01:08:45.20 --> 01:08:47.68 things. I mean, when you're in college and everybody's like, oh, you're a kid in college,
01:08:47.68 --> 01:08:50.96 but when you're in the army and you're like, oh, you're in the army, you're on your second
01:08:50.96 --> 01:08:57.60 appointment. You know, what do you do? And charge of seven other lives, include it as well as my own.
01:08:57.60 --> 01:09:01.20 And I tell them where to move, what to do, how to shoot, and how to how to do things. And they're like,
01:09:01.76 --> 01:09:07.20 oh, okay. Yeah, I'll get some kid in the gym. In my gym, we'll be like, oh, yeah, well, you know,
01:09:07.20 --> 01:09:11.52 while we'll meet 23, you know, oh, yeah, when I was a 23, I was in my third seal, but dude,
01:09:12.80 --> 01:09:18.000 kill me. Actually, we were drinking beers because there was nothing going on. But anyway,
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.04 kill him. But one year, kill him. But one year, like a beast. So then, how did you feel about that
01:09:25.04 --> 01:09:28.88 two weeks leave during the middle deployment? Well, I mean, it's a constant worry. Like, how are my
01:09:28.88 --> 01:09:33.12 guys doing? We had a satellite phone. We didn't have internet or things like that. So I couldn't just
01:09:33.12 --> 01:09:39.92 like, hit him up real quick on a, because the army makes you do that. Well, yeah, they allow it.
01:09:39.92 --> 01:09:43.28 And then they, they say you need, you know, this stuff. And but they're pretty aren't they don't they push
01:09:43.28 --> 01:09:49.04 it pretty hard? No. I mean, I mean, I was stuck with the question hard. Well, that's, and I,
01:09:49.04 --> 01:09:53.04 and I don't, just, just, just, don't discriminate. I don't know how to say this politically correct.
01:09:53.04 --> 01:09:59.12 There's, there's the army that's at Boggermar for space that wears PT belts that, you know,
01:09:59.12 --> 01:10:03.92 goes to Dunkin, goes to get their Dunkin down and that complaints because not a lot takes too
01:10:03.92 --> 01:10:08.64 hot. And then there's the people like us where it's like, there's 22 of us or 21 of us
01:10:08.64 --> 01:10:12.72 sitting out in Millenau where taking no showers. No one's going to come say, hey, you need to do this.
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:16.80 We had one kid come out now ran into him again in Lansing, Michigan actually had an event. He,
01:10:16.80 --> 01:10:21.04 you know, out of the military and I didn't realize it was him. But he came out. He chose to be a financial
01:10:22.08 --> 01:10:25.76 guy. And this says in the financial world, and that's fine. Hey, you want to do finance,
01:10:25.76 --> 01:10:30.08 you want to work in the S4 shop? Great. It comes out. They're given a survey. Some dumps survey that
01:10:30.08 --> 01:10:34.08 they're just, whatever, big army wants. You know, the good idea fairies and whatever. But
01:10:34.48 --> 01:10:37.36 he's on the rooftop. He's like, oh, man, hope we're getting a gunfight. It's going to be great.
01:10:38.16 --> 01:10:41.92 And look, all of a sudden, excuse me. He's like, well, no, I just, you know, because I, I'm on the
01:10:41.92 --> 01:10:46.08 five all the time, I just, I mean, I love, I want to see a gun, you know, I hope we're getting a firefight.
01:10:46.72 --> 01:10:50.80 I said, what, don't you get if they shoot it us, my guys could get hit for what your
01:10:50.80 --> 01:10:55.52 hoping happens here. I said, I got an idea, get off my roof. And he's like, well, I said, no,
01:10:55.52 --> 01:10:59.84 seriously, get, I'm going to throw you off this roof. You don't get off it. And he looked at,
01:10:59.84 --> 01:11:03.28 I critter, one of my, one of my guys and critter goes, oh, no, Sergeant Mills is real.
01:11:03.28 --> 01:11:08.56 I'll throw you off this roof. And I said, if we get shot at, don't get in my guys way. Stay the
01:11:08.56 --> 01:11:13.84 fuck off the roof and get down. Yeah. And he was just like, but I don't get it. I'm like, it's not a game.
01:11:13.84 --> 01:11:18.16 This isn't, I mean, when we get a firefight, you know, we get, you know, people run up on their
01:11:18.16 --> 01:11:22.24 PT shorts and their flip flops and they got their Kevlar on their body on her, but, I mean,
01:11:22.24 --> 01:11:25.92 that's real life, bullets are flying. In the way he was just so nonsular, I hope we get a firefight.
01:11:25.92 --> 01:11:30.08 That would be really cool. It's like, my guys could get shot. Like, what part of the cool don't you get?
01:11:30.72 --> 01:11:35.52 So, I mean, they're, you know, the army does push something to other times. We're just left alone.
01:11:35.52 --> 01:11:40.96 Yeah, I just remember guys going from, from guys that were in combat all the time, not
01:11:40.96 --> 01:11:46.24 fobits, but, and they, it seemed like the command, their commands wanted to go home for those two
01:11:46.24 --> 01:11:49.92 weeks and hey, man, you need to take this break on your feet. Oh, the feet mandatory. Yeah, I think
01:11:49.92 --> 01:11:53.68 you meant like Colin home. Colin home, stuff, not man. Oh, no, I just meant going home, sorry.
01:11:53.68 --> 01:11:56.48 Yeah, yeah, you have to go home. You have to go. Okay, that's what I thought. And a lot of
01:11:56.48 --> 01:12:00.64 guys, some guys don't want to, but you have to. You know, the Colin home thing, I think is,
01:12:00.64 --> 01:12:05.28 is, I don't know how often you call to home, but I try to call them like once a week. Once or
01:12:05.28 --> 01:12:08.96 twice a week. Because if you start doing more than that, I think it's worse on both of you. Well,
01:12:08.96 --> 01:12:13.12 you ran out of things to say. Oh, it's cool. You know, I mean, no offense to anybody's love life
01:12:13.12 --> 01:12:17.44 out there, but in my life, I'm out getting along great, you know, but when I would call home,
01:12:17.44 --> 01:12:19.92 hey, we're doing, well, just no day and I have to answer and I don't want to be like, well,
01:12:19.92 --> 01:12:23.92 it's out and I got shot at and then I ended up killing two people and then this guy got hurt,
01:12:23.92 --> 01:12:27.52 but it's okay. He's going to be fine. You don't want to be afraid. You know, she can't say
01:12:27.52 --> 01:12:30.40 guys up like, well, well, you know, I went on patrol the day, got to help with help with
01:12:30.40 --> 01:12:35.12 kid tie a shoe, you know, and like that gets old and then what'd you do? Well, I went to school today and
01:12:35.12 --> 01:12:38.40 I mean, there's no real story there, right? So I got to let it build for a week or two.
01:12:38.40 --> 01:12:45.44 I definitely recommend that. I mean, that the nicest way. No, I know, totally. And I think if you're
01:12:45.44 --> 01:12:50.08 if you're calling home every day, then you're like, you're you're missing and you're connecting
01:12:50.08 --> 01:12:53.60 and just like, no, like you said, let it build, have something to talk about real,
01:12:54.24 --> 01:12:56.96 and what does that get to know? And like, what are you thinking about? And then you get a
01:12:56.96 --> 01:13:02.24 little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
01:13:02.24 --> 01:13:06.08 You know, I see it happened. You know, I even say I happen to mean Kelsey. You know, like, what are you thinking about? Well, no. What do you think? What do you want to talk about?
01:13:06.08 --> 01:13:13.60 Well, no, oh, you got nothing to talk to me about. It's like, no, I don't. And it's not a bad thing. It's not that I love you any less. It's that literally I can't tell you what happened here.
01:13:13.60 --> 01:13:22.48 Because it's not going to make you feel better about the situation. And so, and you know another thing is, you know, you got all this stuff going on,
01:13:22.48 --> 01:13:27.04 and then your wife's like, you won't believe this and you're like, what? And she's like, um,
01:13:28.08 --> 01:13:32.96 we lost that library book that we got out. And now they called and they want us to pay for it. You're like,
01:13:33.76 --> 01:13:39.60 just got the check. Let's get in the check. We're going to be good. Well, they overcharge it. I'm going to do your research.
01:13:40.56 --> 01:13:47.68 You find it online, you know, cheaper. Yeah, yeah, some of the big, the big, the big, the big
01:13:47.68 --> 01:13:54.08 drama, drama at home. You know, the wide eye, like, oh, no, it's like, that's not okay. Well, I watched the guy
01:13:54.08 --> 01:13:59.68 bleeding, bleeding out to the head. Yeah, that's my finger in the bullet holes. So I get what you're saying. Same thing. I was like,
01:13:59.68 --> 01:14:05.52 well, my God, I mean, believe this. But you go ahead. Tell me what happened with you. Tell me about the
01:14:05.52 --> 01:14:12.16 spoiled by mayonnaise that you had on your sandwich. Um, that's not joke. That's awful. You get home from that
01:14:12.16 --> 01:14:17.44 deployment. Going back to the book. My parents threw down from Michigan, Josh and Dina. This is your
01:14:17.44 --> 01:14:23.20 Josh, as your brother-in-law, Dina's his wife. We're there. And some of the guys from my unit came over.
01:14:23.92 --> 01:14:28.88 I manned the barbecue, the smell of charcoal fired. Hamburger's drifted over the neighborhood. And I
01:14:28.88 --> 01:14:36.40 felt like the luckiest man alive. Kelsey and I had a dog, two cars and now a house. We were young
01:14:36.40 --> 01:14:40.08 family living the American dream. So you had the gold vine house and now you actually bought one, right?
01:14:40.08 --> 01:14:43.20 Far of attorney. I called my wife and she's like, guess what I did today? I was like, what? She
01:14:43.20 --> 01:14:46.08 was like, what? She goes, I bought a house. And like, how did you do that? She's like, well, you bought it.
01:14:46.08 --> 01:14:49.92 It sounded like a piece of paper. Far of attorney. So speaking of jokes, I tell her time I
01:14:49.92 --> 01:14:54.32 thought, there we go. But, uh, now we bought a house and then my brother-in-law, he was, they had a
01:14:54.32 --> 01:15:00.40 young young child. They still do Reagan. But, over the time, she was like, seven, eight months old, I guess.
01:15:00.40 --> 01:15:04.96 And I was like, you drink in that Josh because I have responsibilities. You know, like, oh, I'm
01:15:04.96 --> 01:15:08.64 all holding her in that or something like I can't drink. And then by the end of the night, he passed
01:15:08.64 --> 01:15:17.92 down the fire. Junkers could be smoked to pack a sick. He's like, oh, that hurts so bad.
01:15:19.28 --> 01:15:27.20 And then I was like, responsibility. Famous last words. Back to the book, fortunately after
01:15:27.20 --> 01:15:32.16 I got home, I didn't struggle with any past memories of combat. Although I do, I know any number of soldiers
01:15:32.16 --> 01:15:38.96 who do. I told a few stories to Kelsey about our unit's time in Robatt and BMG about going without a
01:15:38.96 --> 01:15:44.16 shower for so long and about some fire fights, we got into an impalent, corvette. But she didn't
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:50.24 like to talk about those things much. And I understood that. I found I could shut off the memories
01:15:50.24 --> 01:15:57.20 pretty easily. My logic was straightforward. I was a combat soldier. That's what I did. I told my mind
01:15:57.20 --> 01:16:02.08 to go to certain places and I refused to allow to go to other places. I found that I could connect
01:16:02.08 --> 01:16:08.32 with my family best that way. Although I know other guys handle things differently with equal success.
01:16:10.40 --> 01:16:14.24 And the reason I threw that in there is just because, you know, I get a lot of guys that asked me
01:16:14.24 --> 01:16:20.08 about how to handle the whatever memories they're bringing home. And I thought that was a pretty
01:16:20.08 --> 01:16:23.60 good methodology, man. Like, no, okay, I'm not going to think about that right now. Yeah, I mean,
01:16:23.60 --> 01:16:27.92 it was like I had a barrier. You're just so desensitized when you're over there. Like,
01:16:27.92 --> 01:16:32.000 I'm pretty sure the book talks about it. But we went on patrol and then one of the A&A guys
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.48 or A&P was wearing a bright green, you know, like a construction vest. And now we're all
01:16:38.48 --> 01:16:42.88 in getting ready to load up in the trucks and someone made the joke I think it was me or maybe
01:16:42.88 --> 01:16:45.92 creator. But either way, we were like, well, that guy's going to get shot today because he stood out.
01:16:46.64 --> 01:16:49.44 He ended up being the only guy that was shot that day and he ended up dying, you know, eventually
01:16:49.44 --> 01:16:53.68 from his wounds. But he said, oh, well, he got, yep, that guy died. But you're just, you know,
01:16:53.68 --> 01:16:58.16 say it like, hoping to get shot, but you're just like, well, that's part of what happens. But she
01:16:58.16 --> 01:17:01.44 didn't like hearing my stories of the combat and things like that. So I was just like, well, I guess I won't
01:17:01.44 --> 01:17:04.72 talk about them. She's like, you just get so excited about telling those stories and you laugh about it.
01:17:04.72 --> 01:17:10.48 And it's real serious. I'm like, well, I made it. Like, you know, yeah, but you still snap an action.
01:17:10.48 --> 01:17:15.76 I was driving to my house with my buddy. And we went past the firing range and they opened up
01:17:15.76 --> 01:17:21.36 the 240s and like, I hit the brakes contact right contact right at pull over and me and him.
01:17:21.36 --> 01:17:26.32 I both reaching for our M4s, which was supposed to be next to us. We're like, oh, oh, yeah,
01:17:26.32 --> 01:17:34.96 I made a mini van. It was a Chevy in Paul. For me, wasn't mini van. I have a mini van. I love it.
01:17:36.24 --> 01:17:41.20 Oh, speaking of many vans, you found out you're, you're going to be a daddy at this point, too,
01:17:41.20 --> 01:17:44.40 when you came home from your second appointment. Oh, no, that'd be awful. If I came from second
01:17:44.40 --> 01:17:48.96 appointment, I found something to be a dad. It took us a little while. Oh, well, four months after I got back,
01:17:48.96 --> 01:17:54.32 we're going to, yeah, right off. Yeah, that case, a few of the ones I wasn't trying to apply anything.
01:17:54.32 --> 01:18:00.16 I don't know. Yeah, but we, yeah, so I didn't plan on it right away, you know, I haven't
01:18:00.16 --> 01:18:05.60 children, but find out we're going to have children or have a daughter and work down great, you know,
01:18:05.60 --> 01:18:10.64 I'm very excited. Did the whole nesting thing? My wife had a sweet Mazda 3 hatchback. What's the
01:18:10.64 --> 01:18:14.64 whole nesting thing? You know, like set the baby room up. You never really, I could tell my wife
01:18:14.64 --> 01:18:19.84 because I bought her in a brand new car in 2010. I was brand new offline Mazda 3 hatchback. She loves it.
01:18:19.84 --> 01:18:23.76 I loved it. I was like, that baby's he's not going to fit in that car. She's like, yeah, it's going to be fine.
01:18:23.76 --> 01:18:28.88 I'm like, no, it's not. Finding a so mad one day, like after arguing with her about it, I went
01:18:28.88 --> 01:18:32.24 out there and I popped the car seat in. And I said, go ahead and jump in your, Jared, obviously, honey,
01:18:32.24 --> 01:18:36.000 go ahead and jump in there and she couldn't fit. She's like, oh, just jump right off at 10. She was so mad.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:44.08 I loved everything. You know, because then I won. I won that game. You were right. That feels good.
01:18:45.52 --> 01:18:49.84 I got you off topic. So yeah, we were going to have a kid. I'm straight on top of away.
01:18:49.84 --> 01:18:54.08 Tight on top of over here. I know you're professional. I didn't doubt that.
01:18:55.92 --> 01:19:02.88 September 27, 2011, their daughter was born. Wow. I made some weird noises in the back of my throat.
01:19:02.88 --> 01:19:09.20 So there our kid was with goo all over her and she was wrinkly and scrunched up and all I could
01:19:09.20 --> 01:19:16.08 think of that she was the most beautiful thing in the world. It's so great to cry. The nurse said,
01:19:17.12 --> 01:19:21.68 I did not cry. So I just kept making weird noises in my throat.
01:19:21.68 --> 01:19:26.48 I was like, the nurse is like, it's okay. It's okay to cry, Mr. Meals. I'm like,
01:19:26.48 --> 01:19:34.32 I'm crying. Now I'm like, oh, that was weird in this case. Like, this guy's taking his kid home.
01:19:34.32 --> 01:19:37.76 I mean, I almost fought the pediatrician that day. Oh man. I wanted to get there.
01:19:37.76 --> 01:19:41.44 I was talking about Belgium beer, some damn thing. And like, I hear the two doctors talk and my kids
01:19:41.44 --> 01:19:45.20 and they're crying and the nurse comes out saying, hey, who's supposed to be looking at my kid? And they're like,
01:19:45.20 --> 01:19:49.92 oh, doctor, this, you have the baby and their, I don't have one in there. And she was, you must have a guy goes,
01:19:49.92 --> 01:19:56.24 oh, I'm supposed to forgot how on chuckles it off and then goes it back, talk and I told the nurse to get that kid back in that room. And I turned around that guy.
01:19:56.24 --> 01:20:02.40 And I'm already up like, you know, 18, 20 hours because we went to labor and do whatever and eyes of bloodshot. And I'm just like,
01:20:02.40 --> 01:20:06.72 still jack from looking at the weights and I'm like, you know, you're not going to look at my kid.
01:20:06.72 --> 01:20:12.48 If I'm yet better pediatrician, the guy's like, and I had to go get Kelsey's thumb and the came in. She was, they were very nice when they got in.
01:20:12.48 --> 01:20:18.16 I was like, I don't know why. You know, Tower and Orva's guy, like, I will beat you if you touch my kid.
01:20:18.16 --> 01:20:25.52 You're not doing her job, bro. Now we put her in the car seat, take her home and we get home and I'm other than
01:20:25.52 --> 01:20:30.32 those with us and we're looking at Kelsey goes to your car. She was, why should you not buckled? As a team,
01:20:30.32 --> 01:20:35.12 I thought you did. She was Travis, I thought you did it. No. Strike, you know, you're on. Good,
01:20:35.12 --> 01:20:38.72 good data ward, no one coming out of the gates coming out of the gate, strong.
01:20:38.72 --> 01:20:43.20 I think they'll fortify me in a drive, no car. There are no buckled cars. I'm a good driver.
01:20:43.20 --> 01:20:47.92 Yeah, that's good. Luckily. And meanwhile this time you're still a soldier, you go to,
01:20:47.92 --> 01:20:54.000 you go to a jump master school and you failed jump master school the first time. I did.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.52 Yeah. And in the sad part, it wasn't like the J&PI. There you go.
01:20:57.52 --> 01:20:59.84 Let's jump. I'm a part of the J&PI. The written exam.
01:21:01.84 --> 01:21:06.32 Yeah. That reading. That's fun. No, you know what? That academic part of jump master school.
01:21:06.32 --> 01:21:11.20 I've heard that's the most brutal part. It was rough. It was rough. And I failed. I failed that.
01:21:11.20 --> 01:21:16.000 And I was like, oh, you must be a dumbass, you know, I'm like, I am. But I went back
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.64 to the next, you know, the next cycle. I did a better thing. Through. You know, I thought it was cool
01:21:20.64 --> 01:21:27.84 in here. You talked about, you know, one kid you threw out the plane. Yeah. I give another kid you
01:21:27.84 --> 01:21:31.76 kicked out the plane. Never find. Yeah. And that's the thing. They came and thank you later.
01:21:31.76 --> 01:21:34.64 Because they're just like scared, right? I'm not sure if they made it on. I don't know.
01:21:34.64 --> 01:21:40.72 Yeah. Well, it no. Look that you made up here. Yeah. You claimed.
01:21:40.72 --> 01:21:45.76 That's most fabricated. Look. No. Yeah. So I give my brief. And I always made the youngest
01:21:45.76 --> 01:21:51.04 or the, like the least senior guy I give the brief. So like you tell him the brief if, you know,
01:21:51.04 --> 01:21:54.72 I say green light go and you don't go, give it to the or two more times. If you don't jump,
01:21:54.72 --> 01:21:58.48 I will unhook you. Attach you, give it off or it'll touch your equipment. So, you know, say go to
01:21:58.48 --> 01:22:01.28 the real pair trip or whatever. That's what I know jumpers. That one is called.
01:22:01.28 --> 01:22:05.20 Uh, they have a name for it. Yeah. Jump refusal. Jump refusal. Yeah. So yeah.
01:22:05.20 --> 01:22:09.52 Could then that be a territory. Oh, yeah. And then as I say my brief, you're, you know, this is all three
01:22:09.52 --> 01:22:13.12 pages you got to memorize. I'd stop my brief right there and say, but I guarantee you today
01:22:13.12 --> 01:22:18.56 if you're on my door, you are going. So I told the guy, you know, green light go and like the first
01:22:18.56 --> 01:22:22.48 guy went. The second guy went third guy went fourth guy or whatever. That'll go and then finally
01:22:22.48 --> 01:22:27.68 get to like 13 or 14. That's what's the exit all, you know, 30 pair tripers or 32, whatever.
01:22:28.96 --> 01:22:32.32 And this guy's like frozen. I'm like, I know you, uh, think you're not going to go, but you
01:22:32.32 --> 01:22:36.40 better jump out of this plane and you're like, you know, and I said, I told you you were going and
01:22:36.40 --> 01:22:40.16 then back with shirt back with pants. I just threw them out and then the person behind
01:22:40.16 --> 01:22:45.52 was like, I'm like, get going. And then another jump, the same thing happened. I said, I told you
01:22:45.52 --> 01:22:50.24 you were going. He's, they're frozen the door. Like one foot back. I just grabbed the top. Oh,
01:22:50.24 --> 01:22:53.28 sorry, back that grab the top of the plane. I just kicked right in the back of his pair. She
01:22:53.28 --> 01:22:58.72 out of the door. We went. I was like, we'd hear those rumors, but I never saw it happen.
01:22:58.72 --> 01:23:01.84 Yeah. I mean, if they don't jump, they're going to lose money. And then they're going to waste a
01:23:01.84 --> 01:23:05.44 good pass. And then the plane either can go back around, make another pass and like prolong
01:23:05.44 --> 01:23:09.76 everybody's night and make it harder because I have a person I got to paperwork on now,
01:23:09.76 --> 01:23:14.32 because I don't like to do. Or you can barely write. Yeah, what I understand. So what? No
01:23:14.32 --> 01:23:18.96 right hand. So he's be a hand-it. So my ex-back. But that's cool. Take, take folks and me
01:23:18.96 --> 01:23:25.68 with a lot of like, um, but yeah, I mean, so it was just fear got the best of them. And I was just like,
01:23:25.68 --> 01:23:29.28 no, we're going today. And you're, you know, I said some other choice words in there here, but they
01:23:29.28 --> 01:23:34.80 went. But what I liked about that from like a broader perspective than just airborne school is
01:23:34.80 --> 01:23:39.12 like so often, man, people just need to like go. Because like like you said, once you go and you
01:23:39.12 --> 01:23:43.28 get that first thing under your belt, then they go and they jump. It's no problem. You know, but so often
01:23:43.28 --> 01:23:47.44 people are, they just, they're just scared of the unknown, you know? And what you got to do is just go,
01:23:47.44 --> 01:23:52.72 just jump. Well, my fit jump in everyone's school, that can I, you know, peevey two meals.
01:23:52.72 --> 01:23:56.48 I jumped out and it was nighttime combat. I was so scared. I didn't know what to do. But I was like,
01:23:56.48 --> 01:24:00.40 well, I'm not going to be the big sister on this airplane, you know. So I drove out like suitman.
01:24:00.40 --> 01:24:07.12 And I got my lift, leg caught up in the risers. I was coming down like a, like a flamingo and my
01:24:07.12 --> 01:24:11.68 shoot started to collapse on me. And I was shaking my, I was falling fast. But I had pull my reserve.
01:24:11.68 --> 01:24:16.32 You pulled your reserve at everyone's school. Yeah. No kid. They were mad about that. Oh, yeah.
01:24:16.32 --> 01:24:20.56 But I was dropping fast and I guess you survived, which is a good thing. Yeah. Yeah. But my,
01:24:20.56 --> 01:24:24.000 my leg was tangled up so bad. It's in the first jump in the vision. I'm like, oh,
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.56 I don't know if I want to do it anymore. And then the guy in front of me went and I was like,
01:24:26.56 --> 01:24:33.20 well, okay, he did it. That's, yeah, that's not good to have a, uh, have to pull your reserve
01:24:33.20 --> 01:24:37.44 at an airborne school. But I mean, it wasn't because of malfunctioning because my own stupidity.
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000 I dove out like suitman, my left leg got caught up in there and I couldn't shake it out. And then I was
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.36 like watching the silver wets above me, they're like, pull your reserve bells and they're like, okay.
01:24:45.36 --> 01:24:55.12 Take up E6. So now you're, now your staff sergeant take over a weapon squad.
01:24:56.64 --> 01:25:03.20 Which is the senior spot. But I was, I went to work that day. I got picked, finished AL, ALC, or whatever.
01:25:04.80 --> 01:25:09.04 Which is a E6 course. I went my first turn. So I have offers and, you know, second and first brigade.
01:25:09.60 --> 01:25:14.08 Five away. I'm, I'm going to take those about have a squad leader spot, you know, I get back from
01:25:14.08 --> 01:25:18.72 this four day vacation or four day break. I came back and gave him the senior spot. Here you go.
01:25:18.72 --> 01:25:26.64 Yes. Oh, yes. And Kelsey, she didn't really want you to go overseas again to Chey.
01:25:27.20 --> 01:25:31.84 I mean, yes and no, she understood it. But I mean, obviously no wife wants to, they're
01:25:31.84 --> 01:25:35.28 love when to go overseas or there hasn't been to go overseas or whatever. We just bought a house,
01:25:35.28 --> 01:25:39.28 the baby was just born quite frankly, we could use, we could use the tax pretty money.
01:25:39.28 --> 01:25:44.64 100% could use that money that you get from being over there and also we have the soldiers coming
01:25:44.64 --> 01:25:48.24 to my house and have barbecues and Chey-C's, how they look up to me and how I'm in charge of them.
01:25:48.24 --> 01:25:53.04 And it's this old camaraderie and brotherhood thing. I had orders to forthood. I had my sergeant major
01:25:53.04 --> 01:25:57.04 cancel on. I was like, I don't know why you're kicking me out. I go, I'm not kicking you out. I said,
01:25:57.04 --> 01:26:00.48 sergeant major, I have orders to forthood and he's like, you, not want to go. I said, no, I need to
01:26:00.48 --> 01:26:05.20 deploy these guys. So he's just like, I'll take care of it. The way you put in the book is the
01:26:05.20 --> 01:26:10.64 reason I went overseas was because of the soldier next to me. The guys in my squad are jobless to
01:26:10.64 --> 01:26:16.64 protect American, keep the Taliban at bay. I'd train my men. I taught them all I knew. It was my
01:26:16.64 --> 01:26:20.32 job to take care of them. I couldn't imagine them deploying without me.
01:26:23.44 --> 01:26:27.92 And I mean, I was quite frankly upset. I got those orders. But they were building a new brigade.
01:26:27.92 --> 01:26:32.56 And they wanted combat NCOs with over two years of combat experience to go help, you know,
01:26:32.56 --> 01:26:37.60 lead these guys. And I was like, a noble, I get it. But not not for me right now.
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.96 You're leaving. And Josh is going away at the same time. Your brother and all your wife's brother
01:26:46.96 --> 01:26:53.20 going away. Same time. Here we go. Back to the book. She was in tears. A beautiful mess.
01:26:53.20 --> 01:26:59.12 Josh was leaving on that same deployment too. But a day later than I was. So he came to see me off
01:26:59.12 --> 01:27:04.72 in support of sister. I hugged him and he hugged me back. Chloe was five months old and sleeping
01:27:04.72 --> 01:27:10.08 sounding her car seat. She never woke up when I kissed her cheek. I unstrap my daughter,
01:27:10.08 --> 01:27:14.88 picked her up and cradled her tightly one last time in my arms. She inhaled deeply smiled
01:27:15.76 --> 01:27:22.000 and carried on sleeping. Then I waved goodbye. Walking away from my loved ones, I had to ask myself
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.20 if this third deployment felt different from the first two. I had a child to think about now.
01:27:27.20 --> 01:27:34.40 A family. I knew there would be 10 days in fire fights ahead. But honestly, I wasn't afraid of dying.
01:27:35.76 --> 01:27:39.44 I wouldn't be reckless and make myself an easy target and I didn't want to die.
01:27:40.32 --> 01:27:46.08 But I knew that if I got hit, then I got hit. If it happened, then it was meant to be.
01:27:47.76 --> 01:27:53.44 As a soldier, it's not like I talk about my emotions every day. I don't write poetry. I don't
01:27:53.44 --> 01:28:00.08 watch romantic comedies as a rule. I'm trained to kill people. That's what I do. You've got to be
01:28:00.08 --> 01:28:07.84 tough in the 80s. Second, you've got to be as hard as life. You don't want to show weakness ever,
01:28:07.84 --> 01:28:12.80 particularly with any of your guys around. When you're overseas and out in the middle of nowhere
01:28:12.80 --> 01:28:19.04 and you have 12 to 20 guys with you, you can't take a seat and say you're done. As a leader,
01:28:19.04 --> 01:28:25.44 I couldn't throw my helmet down and complain that things weren't fair. You have to make the best of it.
01:28:25.44 --> 01:28:33.76 You have to keep going. You've got to be as tough as they come. But even so, as I walked away from
01:28:33.76 --> 01:28:41.04 my wife and child and brother-in-law, the wind struck my eye and I wiped away the wetness with the
01:28:41.04 --> 01:28:50.64 back of my sleeve. Harder going away on this deployment? No, a little bit. It didn't feel right.
01:28:51.44 --> 01:28:54.72 I actually had a conversation with my brother-in-law and his garage with him.
01:28:54.72 --> 01:28:58.08 I was like, you know, Josh, it's always a guy that you don't expect to get hit. That gets hit.
01:28:58.08 --> 01:29:02.32 We didn't start naming out the people from our deployments because we were the same brigade always,
01:29:02.32 --> 01:29:06.72 just different unions. And I said, I just don't feel good about it. I mean, nothing I couldn't
01:29:06.72 --> 01:29:10.48 go where I wasn't going to go. But yeah, it was harder. You know, my wife and everything. I was
01:29:10.48 --> 01:29:13.68 supposed to leave the next day. I went to work and I like, hey, look, we need to take this
01:29:13.68 --> 01:29:19.28 truck at guys over. Can you leave tonight instead of tomorrow night? And I was like, well,
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:23.36 yeah, I got to leave work right now. And I was going to see my wife and my kid and I like, yeah,
01:29:23.36 --> 01:29:30.40 you can go. So I went. But it does, you know, I wouldn't say each deployment's harder. The second one
01:29:30.40 --> 01:29:35.20 wasn't hard for me to go. I mean, I had to take a bite, but part of my job, the third one was more
01:29:35.20 --> 01:29:40.40 man, I hope I get, you know, to come back home. But you got to push those thoughts, you know, out
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:44.80 of your head. You can't, I was stop people can't dwell on and you can't think about it. You can't,
01:29:45.52 --> 01:29:49.52 you know, worry about what's going to happen. You got to just push through and whatever happens
01:29:49.52 --> 01:29:54.08 does happen. But, you know, as long as you're not reckless and careless, you know, you can't
01:29:54.08 --> 01:29:56.96 affect what your out comes. You're going to be anyway. So you might as well just keep pushing forward.
01:29:57.76 --> 01:30:04.16 Yeah, you know, you, um, and now you end up on this deployment, the the fog of the strong point
01:30:04.16 --> 01:30:09.20 that you're in so small doesn't even have a name. Just like the middle of nowhere. This is strong point.
01:30:11.28 --> 01:30:18.08 And you got there. What was the, what was the environment like there? I mean, the units that
01:30:18.08 --> 01:30:24.24 leave always give real great advice and their commander told our commander, you're not going to
01:30:24.24 --> 01:30:28.08 really change a lot of stuff here with how the rules of engagement's now, because the rules of
01:30:28.08 --> 01:30:33.36 engagement is over different, present, sees their different leadership changed. And they said, you know,
01:30:34.16 --> 01:30:38.64 when we go out, we take shape of cream, we line when we walked, you know, we come back. That's
01:30:38.64 --> 01:30:41.44 all you're going to do. And of course, when we get there, we're hard charging, we're going to go
01:30:41.44 --> 01:30:47.68 here, here, here, here and here and here. And SOPs changed the bow space all changed. We lived in
01:30:48.88 --> 01:30:53.12 like my first one, I was on the big five. Second moment, I was in a row of little, uh, little
01:30:53.12 --> 01:30:58.000 strong points and fobs. And then this one, we were just like, hey, here you go. We're going to hell
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.24 after you're in your drop-toff. This is you. Three six of the around is all bad. And that's just how it was.
01:31:04.24 --> 01:31:09.84 So we would go out the first day went out, got a huge firefight. And that's my guys really
01:31:09.84 --> 01:31:13.52 understood. Like I wasn't a lot of schools. Like I went to college and went to jump at
01:31:13.52 --> 01:31:18.88 just school. I went to the advanced leadership course, the ALC course for E6. So when I got back
01:31:18.88 --> 01:31:24.08 and I got to the weapons squad leader spot, some of the guys didn't know who I was from anybody.
01:31:24.08 --> 01:31:28.48 Got it. My first sergeant knew me, that's why I got this spot. But the other guys were like,
01:31:28.48 --> 01:31:33.04 why the hell is this guy jokes around? He doesn't, he's not mean, he doesn't smoke anybody. He's,
01:31:33.04 --> 01:31:37.92 you know, really, I was polite, I guess. And whatever, you know, normal everyday guy, I didn't have
01:31:37.92 --> 01:31:41.76 this trip in my shoulder. After I first firefight, like two of the guys that came from a different
01:31:41.76 --> 01:31:46.08 after unit were like, look, I didn't get while you were the squad leader, I didn't get how you got E6.
01:31:46.08 --> 01:31:51.44 And while you were in charge, but now I do because, you know, when she hits a fan, I was,
01:31:51.44 --> 01:31:55.28 I was a guy needing to be there, I guess. Yeah, I mean, this firefight going to the book here,
01:31:57.36 --> 01:32:02.48 sergeant Butler yelled, I'm hit. I'm hit. One of his team leaders, sergeant, Marty Miller ran over
01:32:02.48 --> 01:32:08.000 to him and swept his hands long, but there's body to look for blood, Miller ran back to our lieutenant
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:18.08 report, we couldn't find any. And you just, you sprint it out into this riverbed during this fire
01:32:18.08 --> 01:32:22.000 fight, it's going on. And here you are, I'm still one of my body armor, but I was essentially
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.40 weaponless. If I'd kept my rifle, it would only slowed me down. I ran over to where sergeant
01:32:26.40 --> 01:32:31.04 Butler lay, he was probably 50 meters total away. It's my leg, he shouted, I can't put any weight on it,
01:32:31.04 --> 01:32:36.64 shut up, I yelled. Get on my back now. Let's go without waiting for him to answer. I grabbed
01:32:36.64 --> 01:32:41.36 his right hand with my left squatted down and threw him over my shoulders and a fireman's carry.
01:32:41.36 --> 01:32:48.72 He was probably 185 pounds. I hefted him up and ran back to safety. So there you go, just,
01:32:50.40 --> 01:32:55.20 I understand after you perform like that in a firefighter, boys, like, oh yeah, we get it.
01:32:55.20 --> 01:33:01.52 Well, we, yeah, so we were, on one side of the water, the driver of a bed, and my CEO was like,
01:33:01.52 --> 01:33:05.68 we're going to cross this riverbed. I'm like, all right, I mean, that's really, really open,
01:33:05.68 --> 01:33:11.76 but let's do it. So first, second, and headquarters, whatever, went across. Right. And just, just,
01:33:11.76 --> 01:33:15.28 I always have to point this stuff out, because we have a lot of guys that are in the military that
01:33:15.28 --> 01:33:19.68 listen to us. And so you're just doing a classic cover move. One element's going to stay back on the
01:33:19.68 --> 01:33:23.76 high grid, or on one side of the river to cover as the other element's pushing across. Yeah, and this
01:33:23.76 --> 01:33:27.28 was our first day in country. So we're just trying to learn the balance base. Because we were thinking
01:33:27.28 --> 01:33:33.20 about setting up another OP or strong point on the, on the, on the water, because there's a lot of traffic.
01:33:33.20 --> 01:33:39.28 And they start to move over over there, and they get about 50 meters away, 75 meters, whatever,
01:33:39.28 --> 01:33:43.84 and then all hell breaks loose. Shots, remember where. And third squad and four squad,
01:33:43.84 --> 01:33:48.08 weapon squad, which is me, are over on the river, you know, riverbed. And we start laying in,
01:33:48.08 --> 01:33:52.56 everybody ducks down, takes cover, and I'm still standing, and I'm yelling, and I'm one of my guns
01:33:52.56 --> 01:33:56.64 are shooting to the far left, where she was shooting to the far right, he's the right element. So I walk
01:33:56.64 --> 01:34:01.04 over and I kick the team leader, you know, actually, I think I might as, MAC just head real hard.
01:34:01.04 --> 01:34:05.60 I said, you need to fix this, it's a fix it now, and I told him where to shoot. I went back over
01:34:05.60 --> 01:34:09.44 and directed some more traffic, and then some of the, the other two teams there are some
01:34:09.44 --> 01:34:12.88 of the third squad were just firing all their rounds. After we already gained the fire superiority,
01:34:12.88 --> 01:34:16.40 so I yelled at them and said, you two, no better, you've been here before, control your rounds,
01:34:16.40 --> 01:34:21.76 control your fire, and just make sure it's depressing. And then, Bother went down, and we're like,
01:34:21.76 --> 01:34:26.88 oh, Bother just got hit, and he ended up tearing his MCLACL and Manisca, so whatever. I mean,
01:34:26.88 --> 01:34:31.20 this is a pretty bad damage. And my first start was like, there's squad going get them.
01:34:31.20 --> 01:34:35.44 And I said, oh, first I know where but I got it, so I took my weapon off, and I am for, you know,
01:34:35.44 --> 01:34:39.44 as I hear, hold this for me, I tossed in my M4, because there's just, you know, it gets in the way,
01:34:39.44 --> 01:34:44.000 you know, I ran down, and then the A and A were on the riverbank, right, kind of right behind me.
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.80 They're like, I said, you guys do not shoot, but don't you, don't you shoot me in the back.
01:34:48.80 --> 01:34:51.52 Sorry about that. I didn't get edit that, but maybe you don't. But I was like, don't you
01:34:51.52 --> 01:34:56.08 guys shoot me, so I ran out and got them, took them back, and I set them down, so I ran out, 50,
01:34:56.08 --> 01:35:00.24 you came back, and took them about about 50 to 80 behind the building, and set them down.
01:35:00.88 --> 01:35:04.40 I sat down and get drink a lot of, first sight, my first sight goes, sorry,
01:35:04.40 --> 01:35:08.000 I'm going, I was going to need you back here. Okay, I ran back, I was like, oh, crap, where's my gun?
01:35:09.12 --> 01:35:12.96 And Marty had it, somebody said, oh, here you go. And I was the last one on the objective.
01:35:13.92 --> 01:35:18.40 We had to hike back two miles with Butler on the stretcher, but I was the last one with the F1,
01:35:18.40 --> 01:35:22.08 the objective, pop and smoke for the kayak was to come over and cover our movement.
01:35:24.80 --> 01:35:27.84 The two guys at yellow, the ones that told me they'd found me to hell them back, like we get it now,
01:35:27.84 --> 01:35:31.36 Sergeant Mills will follow you to hell back. Wait, they were just kept shooting, I'm like,
01:35:31.36 --> 01:35:34.64 you guys are team there, you've been here, what are you doing? Yeah, that's awesome, man.
01:35:34.64 --> 01:35:40.64 This reality check. It's another example, I'm in again, just, you're talking about how you
01:35:40.64 --> 01:35:44.16 are in leadership position, you're just backed off a little bit, you're, your pain and
01:35:44.16 --> 01:35:47.84 intentional, what's going on instead of you being on your gun and shooting your backed off,
01:35:47.84 --> 01:35:52.08 you're just watching, that's what you need to do in the leadership position. You got a back off a little bit,
01:35:52.08 --> 01:35:56.000 you got to observe what's happening, you got to make sense of what's happening, and then you got to
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.60 make sure that people are doing the right things. Yeah, I mean, you know, if I shot my gun,
01:36:01.60 --> 01:36:06.32 I mean, that's great. I got to change shoot my M4 and do it had to do, but if I wasn't controlling
01:36:06.32 --> 01:36:11.52 my two heavy weapons squad, you know, like I had the 240, that was the king of the battlefield,
01:36:11.52 --> 01:36:15.20 if you will, with the heaviest firepower, the housing charge of, they weren't doing the job the right way,
01:36:15.20 --> 01:36:18.88 then we were all in trouble. Yeah, as I always say, God bless the machine gunners.
01:36:24.88 --> 01:36:33.12 Yeah. And that, it sounds like that deployment was, I mean, the firefights that you talk about in here
01:36:33.12 --> 01:36:41.28 were a lot, you get a lot of firefights every other day, if not every day. So this one here,
01:36:41.28 --> 01:36:47.60 you went out and did this raid, and then you get word after you do this raid, that there's no
01:36:47.60 --> 01:36:54.72 aircraft to come and pick you up from the raid and go ahead and walk back. Yeah, that's good times.
01:36:54.72 --> 01:37:00.000 Yeah, we went out. We, I told my guys, like, look, it's gonna be hell, it's just bring extra. We had
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:07.92 each of us, 2,000 rounds of 762. Dang. And then we also had, I always carried 2,000 rounds of
01:37:07.92 --> 01:37:12.16 762, or I guess depending on the mission, it would change between a thousand and a thousand. And then I
01:37:12.16 --> 01:37:19.76 carried 20 grenades, 10 on my armor and 10 in my bag, and then another 20, 40 micrys added 20,
01:37:19.76 --> 01:37:27.36 30, and then 425, 5, 5, 6 rounds, like not in my magazines, and I always had. That's like
01:37:27.76 --> 01:37:33.52 freaking 200 pounds. Yeah, but without ammunition, you're kind of screwed, that's really good point.
01:37:33.52 --> 01:37:39.60 So I always had 12 magazines on my person, and then I'd have 13th one in the chamber. So I had 13
01:37:39.60 --> 01:37:43.36 full magazines on me, not because 13's like some special number, just because like my mag
01:37:43.36 --> 01:37:48.56 pouch is weird. Yeah, my mag pouch was, you know, too deep, so I could have 6, 3 on each side.
01:37:50.40 --> 01:37:55.44 Yeah, and we went out there and we ended up getting like 755 fights in my back home. We had 4 to 10 knees,
01:37:56.32 --> 01:38:02.16 and I got, I got, I got put next to the gun the one time, and you know how, it's called
01:38:02.16 --> 01:38:07.68 Pigtail and Ratel the Cup. When you put your 7, 6, 2 link in, you have one side come out, and then you
01:38:07.68 --> 01:38:11.04 you know, switch back it in, and then the other side come out. So when you hook to a gun,
01:38:11.04 --> 01:38:13.76 it pulls out your bag, and then if you have another bag next to you, clip it together.
01:38:14.32 --> 01:38:17.44 What we shot through all my rounds one, and one of the things we shot through all the 7,
01:38:17.44 --> 01:38:22.56 6, 2 rounds, was like, oh, this is so much like lighter, and I got to another spot, and one of my,
01:38:22.56 --> 01:38:28.32 my guy's Brandon, Feste, we've won the guy's with me later on, but he was almost knocked.
01:38:28.32 --> 01:38:31.44 Like, past now, so heavy, I said, don't want me to take my bag. He goes, no, I got it, so as a,
01:38:32.16 --> 01:38:35.60 give me your bag, don't argue with me, and I was like, you need to make it back to the fob.
01:38:35.60 --> 01:38:42.96 And then our, our P.A. that came out with us, awesome guy, Ranger, regiment guy, and he's
01:38:42.96 --> 01:38:47.76 turning to the doctor. He was dehydrating really bad on the walk back, going hallucinations and stuff.
01:38:47.76 --> 01:38:54.24 So, we decided, me and two other guys, three other guys, we're going to head just like,
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:58.24 try to head and walk faster, and everybody else, and like, made it back to the fob first to get a,
01:38:58.24 --> 01:39:03.68 get a m wrap to come get them. But, yeah, and we actually, one of the guys we detained,
01:39:03.68 --> 01:39:10.08 we, we detained all these guys, they had 600 pounds home explosives, batteries, RPGs, and the thing
01:39:10.08 --> 01:39:15.76 was a drone filed their RPG team back on the morse I go to this compound, AK-47s, but we didn't
01:39:15.76 --> 01:39:19.44 get pictures with all their stuff. So, we turned it over to the local national government, and they
01:39:19.44 --> 01:39:25.28 said, we didn't get pictures, these guys are, these guys are free, so let them go. Turns out,
01:39:25.28 --> 01:39:30.72 the guy that, we had detained one of them, because we hide it them, fingerprints were all over my
01:39:30.72 --> 01:39:35.44 bomb, and there were 13 bombs in a row, and they were all over the bombs that the one that I hit,
01:39:35.44 --> 01:39:41.28 so the guy that we captured, as one to put the bomb in, Alpha Troop caught them, and you need to
01:39:41.28 --> 01:39:50.64 take care of them. So, all right, sorry, I bring it down to town. I've been. No.
01:39:52.24 --> 01:39:59.84 Going to April 10th, 2012, you get some intel in the afternoon that there's a,
01:40:00.96 --> 01:40:05.20 ID out in the village, and you guys are going to go check it out, and here we're going to the
01:40:05.20 --> 01:40:09.60 book. We hiked only about 400 yards to the village, in addition to my weapons team, there were
01:40:09.60 --> 01:40:16.40 other squads along on patrol, a total of 28 soldiers. My lieutenant Zachary Lewis went to the left,
01:40:17.20 --> 01:40:21.84 with the first and second squads heading to meet with the village elders, while the rest of our
01:40:21.84 --> 01:40:26.56 men went with me around the village to the outside to offer support in case of an attack.
01:40:26.56 --> 01:40:31.92 Along with my gun team I had, my platoon, sergeant, and a medic, sergeant Daniel Bateson
01:40:33.28 --> 01:40:39.52 with my group, all looks calm. It was just another day and half Gannis Dan, another normal patrol
01:40:39.52 --> 01:40:46.56 we approached an abandoned A&A security post to portable buildings and stopped near the buildings
01:40:46.56 --> 01:40:53.92 to establish a security perimeter. I called for Fesi to bring the minesweeper. Check this area,
01:40:54.48 --> 01:41:00.88 was the only order I gave. Fesi walked up a path used by villagers and scanned all the area around.
01:41:02.16 --> 01:41:08.64 You went up and back and all was clear. No beeps. There was no reason to question anything.
01:41:08.64 --> 01:41:13.52 Fesi finished his minesweeping duties and went up and went to set up on the far flank.
01:41:14.56 --> 01:41:19.68 I called riot up to me and asked him where he thought we should put the gun.
01:41:20.48 --> 01:41:25.68 I knew where it should go, but I wanted to let him decide making sure he knew his stuff.
01:41:26.40 --> 01:41:30.56 He motioned to exactly where I thought we should put it, a good spot. And I said,
01:41:30.56 --> 01:41:37.84 all right, go get an F and bring him up here. That was it. Riot left to go get an F. And as he did,
01:41:37.84 --> 01:41:45.28 I set my backpack down. The backpack touching the dirt was all it took. Such a simple act of war.
01:41:46.80 --> 01:41:56.40 My world erupted. I saw a flash of flame and heard a huge cobblum. Hot jagged pieces of explosives
01:41:56.40 --> 01:42:03.12 ripped through me. I cartwilled backward and over-end, hit the ground and slammed my face hard
01:42:03.12 --> 01:42:09.84 against the compacted earth. Instantly I felt my left eye starting to swell shut. I smelled
01:42:09.84 --> 01:42:17.76 burning flesh my own. I tasted dirt and I was wet with sweat and moisture just like I'd walked
01:42:17.76 --> 01:42:24.08 out of a hot shower. Dirt fell everywhere through the air. It rained down and clung to my eyes,
01:42:24.08 --> 01:42:29.68 nose and mouth. I don't remember rolling over, but I must have because I glanced to the side and saw
01:42:29.68 --> 01:42:35.84 that my right arm was completely gone. I caught a glimpse of my left arm covered in blood and
01:42:35.84 --> 01:42:42.32 tattered. My arm trembled as if it had a will of its own. I looked down and saw my right leg was
01:42:42.32 --> 01:42:49.52 also gone. The stump looked like a piece of raw meat. The bottom of my left leg was still attached,
01:42:49.52 --> 01:42:56.24 but held on only by a few strands of skin. I saw all this in a flash, in an instant.
01:42:56.24 --> 01:43:04.72 I felt confusion, but no panic. My first thought of what was of my guys. I flop my remaining
01:43:04.72 --> 01:43:09.36 arm toward the microphone clip to my carrier plate and somehow managed to push the button. I
01:43:09.36 --> 01:43:16.32 hit a bomb. I said, I need help. Bates in my medic rushes up to me along with staff sergeant
01:43:16.32 --> 01:43:22.08 Keith, hand-bright, arpatoon sergeant. Only about 30 seconds had passed since the blast.
01:43:22.08 --> 01:43:26.000 Immediately they applied turnic hits to hold whatever blood was still inside me.
01:43:27.68 --> 01:43:31.52 I'm not going to make it. I said, leave me and go to save my guys. Shut up, sergeant,
01:43:31.52 --> 01:43:38.16 mills said, Bates in. Let me do my job. I ignored Bates and yelled my men's name like roll call.
01:43:38.16 --> 01:43:46.32 Fesse, riot, nF to see if they were okay. Two were hit. Fesse and riot and other medics were
01:43:46.32 --> 01:43:52.32 already caring for them. They were bleeding, but nothing was missing. They yelled back that they were
01:43:52.32 --> 01:44:00.24 going to be okay. I calmed down. More soldiers ran toward me. Sergeant Alex voice another
01:44:00.24 --> 01:44:06.72 medic wandered aloud where to best get IV access. There were no pulses to check except from my
01:44:06.72 --> 01:44:14.000 carotid artery. He quickly ripped the open my vest, shaved the spot on my chest and put an IV
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.32 straight into my sternum. It hurt going in and I must have hout because he yelled at me that I was
01:44:20.32 --> 01:44:27.68 going to be fine. I yelled back, dock shut up. I know. He and I both calmed down.
01:44:29.04 --> 01:44:33.60 Someone stuck a fence in all pop in my mouth. It's a potent pain killer that releases as the
01:44:33.60 --> 01:44:39.04 pop dissolves. I down the first one spit out the stick and asked for another. You won't need it,
01:44:39.04 --> 01:44:46.08 someone said. I was still thinking that I was going to die. I didn't want to show fear.
01:44:46.96 --> 01:44:50.88 I didn't want to freak out. You never want to show fear around your men.
01:44:52.72 --> 01:44:59.20 Let my family know I dealt with it without crying, I said. Tell them yourself, someone grunted.
01:45:00.24 --> 01:45:07.20 He was being encouraging letting me know I wasn't dead yet. I tried to see around me. I raised my
01:45:07.20 --> 01:45:12.48 head wanting to get a visual of feisty and riot. Someone shoved my head back down.
01:45:13.68 --> 01:45:20.72 I still committed a voice. My one eye was swollen completely shut.
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.48 The other eye was blurry from dirt. I tried to raise my head again. Again, I was pushed flat.
01:45:27.12 --> 01:45:32.88 My eyes were watering now. The dirt turned into mud. Time passed and I didn't know what was happening.
01:45:32.88 --> 01:45:39.76 I mumbled something that there was no reply. Only the study, or the black-awke helicopter
01:45:39.76 --> 01:45:45.44 touching down nearby. Six men surrounded me, hefted me up and carried me over.
01:45:46.64 --> 01:45:50.64 All told, it might have been ten minutes since the blast until the helicopter arrived.
01:45:52.16 --> 01:45:56.72 Fesce and riot were first inside the helicopter. Everything was foggy and noisy and I couldn't
01:45:56.72 --> 01:46:02.24 make out my surroundings clearly. My two guys were on seats and I saw blood and bandages
01:46:02.24 --> 01:46:08.96 jumbled in their direction. Fesce had, strappin' on his face, riot had strappin' his face legs and hands.
01:46:10.32 --> 01:46:14.96 Their image is faded away. I focused on the noise of the rotors.
01:46:17.20 --> 01:46:20.40 We were in the air and the flight medic were taken care of me.
01:46:22.32 --> 01:46:26.24 riot yelled and pain. I tried to look around. Someone needed to attend a riot.
01:46:26.24 --> 01:46:30.16 Where are the medics? One of the medics was talking to the pilots up front.
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:34.72 riot was yelling again. I looked in Fesce's direction and told him to calm down.
01:46:35.84 --> 01:46:40.88 Fesce nodded. riot stopped yelling and I winked at him to let him know he was going to be okay.
01:46:42.32 --> 01:46:43.68 It was all I could think to do.
01:46:45.76 --> 01:46:50.16 The flight medic was a back and view. I could barely seem through the group in my eyes.
01:46:50.16 --> 01:46:53.12 You are a green flight suit and had a big Darth Vader helmet.
01:46:53.12 --> 01:47:00.08 But I tried to speak. He gave me a quizzical look. I yelled as loud as I could. Take your helmet off.
01:47:01.12 --> 01:47:05.12 He took his helmet off. Give my guys water and tell them they're going to be okay. I barked.
01:47:06.32 --> 01:47:08.56 Don't worry. I'll take care of them for you. He said.
01:47:09.76 --> 01:47:12.32 He was busy with some task on me that I couldn't see.
01:47:13.52 --> 01:47:16.24 A moment went by and I added, I'm sorry.
01:47:17.20 --> 01:47:18.56 For what? The medic asked.
01:47:18.56 --> 01:47:23.52 For making you take your helmet off. He gave me a ride grin.
01:47:24.80 --> 01:47:30.56 I realized he'd been doing his job all along doing it well. Both the medics had.
01:47:31.84 --> 01:47:33.92 I just couldn't see all I was happening around me.
01:47:34.56 --> 01:47:38.24 My mind went in and out. I was coherent but fuzzy in spots.
01:47:39.84 --> 01:47:42.88 In 15 minutes the helicopter landed in Canterhar.
01:47:42.88 --> 01:47:49.52 Hospital staff rushed me straight to the operating table. We're going to put you under now.
01:47:50.08 --> 01:47:54.32 Came a voice from above me. I'm fine. I said, leave me alone.
01:47:55.76 --> 01:47:58.24 The mask came over my face and I tried to push it away.
01:47:59.52 --> 01:48:01.28 I remember asking one question.
01:48:01.28 --> 01:48:13.68 Am I ever going to see my baby girl again?
01:48:21.20 --> 01:48:26.48 A little intense. Yeah. My wife and some more choice words.
01:48:26.48 --> 01:48:29.20 I didn't put the book. I said to the flight medic. I had yell three times.
01:48:29.20 --> 01:48:32.08 Last time I threw the effort in there and I was taking a nap.
01:48:33.92 --> 01:48:36.000 In my head I was just taking a private Ryan.
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:39.84 Don't go out for your mom like the medic when he got shot in the movie.
01:48:42.40 --> 01:48:47.76 I was a guy that I had to snap around and I rolled in. I was so embarrassed to have rolled away from it.
01:48:49.20 --> 01:48:52.72 I stood on top of the mountain and shot off a magazine in the half before I got back down.
01:48:52.72 --> 01:48:58.24 The whole don't show fear. I figured I can't change what happened right now.
01:48:58.80 --> 01:49:01.04 If I raise my pulse, I'm going to bleed faster.
01:49:03.28 --> 01:49:07.92 Thanks to my battoons sergeant, sergeant, and docked baits.
01:49:07.92 --> 01:49:11.76 Then docked voice. I was able to maintain most of my blood.
01:49:12.80 --> 01:49:15.52 They must slap those things on you quick turnicots.
01:49:15.52 --> 01:49:17.36 Then 20 seconds or 30 seconds I think.
01:49:17.36 --> 01:49:24.08 Was the aircraft airborne somewhere and got redirected to you? How did you get a helicopter?
01:49:24.08 --> 01:49:24.72 They're so fast.
01:49:25.52 --> 01:49:29.28 We usually went out when there was helicopters on station.
01:49:30.88 --> 01:49:32.64 Because the threat was so real.
01:49:34.64 --> 01:49:37.04 Not that we needed to talk about this and you guys added it out.
01:49:38.40 --> 01:49:43.28 At night time the Taliban had free reign to do what they wanted. We were told because of
01:49:43.28 --> 01:49:48.48 politics or whatever somebody said we could go out at night time. We had the best night time capabilities.
01:49:49.20 --> 01:49:53.36 We couldn't go out on the raid camera, 30 feet in the air. We would watch them on the screen
01:49:53.36 --> 01:49:56.88 and watch them put bombs in at night time. We couldn't shoot them, shoot them,
01:49:56.88 --> 01:50:03.36 motors at them and couldn't get them. It sucked because you'd watch them put the bombs in.
01:50:03.36 --> 01:50:06.56 Then the next day we were supposed to go out and try to find them. That's why in 2012.
01:50:06.56 --> 01:50:08.08 You say they wouldn't let you shoot them?
01:50:08.80 --> 01:50:11.12 They wouldn't let us go out and get them. They're like, no, I can't go out at night time.
01:50:11.12 --> 01:50:15.04 But we can see them. I don't know why you guys talk about it.
01:50:15.04 --> 01:50:17.04 It does bother me. I can't really.
01:50:17.04 --> 01:50:20.16 I don't like it. You don't get political so you don't have to.
01:50:20.16 --> 01:50:23.44 This with me. Just watching them put bombs and knowing I had to go out and try to find them.
01:50:23.44 --> 01:50:28.80 Then the guy that I found or we walked back through seven different firevites and 10 clicks
01:50:30.64 --> 01:50:33.60 when they went out to do the surveillance on the site. I got blown up at that.
01:50:34.24 --> 01:50:37.36 I've blown up at there was 13 in a row right there.
01:50:37.36 --> 01:50:41.36 And if somebody's in the mines were brand and went up and down, not once but twice and nothing
01:50:41.36 --> 01:50:44.80 alarmed them. There was six days of chain together called Squad Killer.
01:50:44.80 --> 01:50:48.000 You had to be the front guy to hit the first one and then everybody behind them would get
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.16 just taken out. So in a way, as probably better that I got hit that day than have somebody
01:50:52.16 --> 01:50:54.32 walk past and hit it and then everybody behind of you are taken out too.
01:50:56.72 --> 01:51:00.40 Yeah, so just the politics of war I guess.
01:51:00.40 --> 01:51:04.56 Kind of sucked because I would watch and put bombs in the Kyra was a command station.
01:51:04.56 --> 01:51:07.84 The guy shooting at us a hundred yards away with dropped their weapons and walk away and I was
01:51:07.84 --> 01:51:11.52 done there were no longer combatant until the Kyra was where out of fuel.
01:51:11.52 --> 01:51:16.64 And we were going to run 1,000 meters this way because if we did then the guys just take
01:51:16.64 --> 01:51:22.24 either a case and take off. So, you know, the red tape. But when I got blown up,
01:51:22.24 --> 01:51:27.60 I did rate on my LT and I got hit. I don't know how bad it is and I told my men
01:51:27.60 --> 01:51:30.24 to get away from me and keep fighting me off and tell me somebody might drop.
01:51:30.24 --> 01:51:34.88 Then the doctors worked on me for 14 hours. I was told nine doctors and seven nurses
01:51:35.52 --> 01:51:38.40 and two nurses for nine hours but I'm airing out of my lungs. Keep me alive.
01:51:38.40 --> 01:51:43.68 Like took turns pumping air. I was so low on blood. They did over 30 transfusions.
01:51:43.68 --> 01:51:47.04 Yeah. And they didn't have enough in stock. So they were like on the big speaker in
01:51:47.04 --> 01:51:52.64 Canahar saying, A positive blood and universal, we need it now. And they were right from
01:51:52.64 --> 01:51:56.48 I had a lot of tests I had to do for like, you know, a possible age idea or things like that
01:51:56.48 --> 01:51:58.48 because it was just like they were just taking and putting it right in.
01:51:58.48 --> 01:52:00.80 Yep. Cool. All right. Thanks for your blood. We're going to put it right in them.
01:52:02.40 --> 01:52:05.36 They knocked me out medically. You know, maybe I'm conscious.
01:52:06.40 --> 01:52:11.60 And they kept me like that for four days. So I just realized, you know, I always said God bless
01:52:11.60 --> 01:52:15.20 the machine gutters but how about a little God bless the doctors and nurses for sure?
01:52:15.20 --> 01:52:19.44 Oh, absolutely. And the medics. I mean, yeah, and the medics. I would tell my, I go and I speak. I
01:52:19.44 --> 01:52:23.44 might one size about perspective and I tell them, you know, about the guys that I've not made
01:52:23.44 --> 01:52:27.92 it back home and I'm thankful it's still be around and living and I'm going to keep living, you know,
01:52:27.92 --> 01:52:33.36 four of them. And so that, you know, their sacrifice wasn't in vain because what happened to me is
01:52:33.36 --> 01:52:37.12 nowhere near what happened to my buddy Francis Jean films of fourth or Frankie, great friend of mine.
01:52:37.12 --> 01:52:42.56 He died. You know, let me find a wife and a four year old at the time. So I'm thankful for the medical
01:52:42.56 --> 01:52:46.80 advancements and Vietnam. A lot of guys didn't come back like me and I get sometimes people like,
01:52:46.80 --> 01:52:50.40 well, we just didn't see people like you during the Vietnam where it just had so sad this happened.
01:52:50.40 --> 01:52:55.44 And I say, well, that's the reason they didn't come back or, you know, so yeah, I mean,
01:52:55.44 --> 01:52:59.28 the doctors knew how to tie things in and my calf muscles around the end of my left leg now,
01:52:59.28 --> 01:53:08.24 I guess, for padding or something, just nuts, you know. But that was on the 10th and then I still
01:53:08.24 --> 01:53:12.24 had my left hand when they, they got done working on me. My wrist had blown up pretty bad by
01:53:12.24 --> 01:53:18.08 my finger, my index, my middle of my thumb. And then two days later in Boggram, they cut it off.
01:53:18.08 --> 01:53:22.000 My brother-in-law flew in from his outpost to Candahar with me and escorted me because
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.12 did you guys have to fill blue books out? I'm going to pour you to pour you to pour it.
01:53:25.12 --> 01:53:27.92 We call it the blue book. It's like, if I die, bear me with this.
01:53:27.92 --> 01:53:32.000 It's not a blue book, but we do. We do do that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't, it was, yeah,
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.84 like a little blue pan. They called the blue book in the army, but it's like, if I die, you know,
01:53:36.56 --> 01:53:39.60 I want my reddering, I want picture of my life and I'm a kid or, you know,
01:53:39.60 --> 01:53:44.56 I want this music to play. Basically playing your funeral is kind of morbid, but I guess it's all right.
01:53:44.56 --> 01:53:50.40 But he was the guy who was supposed to escort my body back home. So he came to where I was at,
01:53:50.40 --> 01:53:55.60 and then they shipped me to Boggram on April 12th. And I was told they took a look at my hand,
01:53:55.60 --> 01:53:59.28 like it's not going to make it. It's just necrotizing and, you know, limb length is a huge
01:53:59.28 --> 01:54:04.40 thing, so they cut it off. And then so they didn't tell him they're doing it. So I rolled
01:54:04.40 --> 01:54:09.12 into surgery and I came back into my hand was gone. But I didn't know because I was still, you know,
01:54:09.12 --> 01:54:15.84 manic or sedated. And then two days later they went for the very first time on April 14th. And I woke
01:54:15.84 --> 01:54:19.60 up in the room. My brother-in-law, he was going to tell me, but what I don't know if I put it in the book.
01:54:19.60 --> 01:54:24.48 I don't think I did. April 14th actually my birthday. So my 25th birthday I found out as a quadruple
01:54:24.48 --> 01:54:30.000 amputee. And it's funny because my first deployment when I didn't know about eight mutations and
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.84 things and Josh was just a friend of mine. I got my brother-in-law. I was like, look, I'm very athletic.
01:54:33.84 --> 01:54:37.68 I play on sports. If I lose a leg or something, just let me bleed out. Like, I mean, I was that
01:54:37.68 --> 01:54:42.72 naive at 19 years old. Like if I lose a hand, just I don't need to live, you know, because I didn't
01:54:42.72 --> 01:54:48.000 know any different. We're now I have I wake up no harm to the legs. And I'm like, oh, okay, well,
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.60 at least I made it, I guess. There. Meanwhile, back on the home front, going to the book,
01:54:55.60 --> 01:55:00.48 Kelsey received a call at 11.53 a.m. her time while standing in her parents' kitchen and Dallas
01:55:00.48 --> 01:55:08.80 taxis years making a tune of fish sandwich. And then it's the commander on the phone. And she describes,
01:55:08.80 --> 01:55:15.76 you know, he tells her straightforward, you know, the severe injury. And this is what she wrote in her
01:55:15.76 --> 01:55:21.44 journal. I could not wrap my head around the pain. My husband must be feeling. I was all alone in the house
01:55:21.44 --> 01:55:26.16 and my actions upset. My daughter to the point where she was screaming. I could do nothing to
01:55:26.16 --> 01:55:31.20 sue her. I couldn't pick her up. I couldn't look at her. My body felt like he was being torn into.
01:55:31.92 --> 01:55:37.76 I wanted so badly to be able to talk to Travis and let him know. I love him and that I think
01:55:37.76 --> 01:55:47.68 God that he was still alive. Then it continues on Kelsey called my dad and Michigan, but when she tried
01:55:47.68 --> 01:55:53.36 to tell him what happened, little would come out. My dad knew something was wrong and kept repeating,
01:55:53.36 --> 01:56:02.88 is he alive, is he alive, is he alive? And then your dad said this, until you go through
01:56:02.88 --> 01:56:06.64 something like that, yourself, it's hard to describe the feeling. There's no eating anymore.
01:56:06.64 --> 01:56:12.24 You don't leave the house. There's a lot of pacing around to just wait. Whenever the phone rang,
01:56:12.24 --> 01:56:25.60 we jumped. You look at the phone and you don't know if you want to answer it or not. So,
01:56:28.64 --> 01:56:36.32 it wasn't obviously, it wasn't just you that got hit too. Your family back home gets hit with the
01:56:36.32 --> 01:56:43.60 shock of all this and also in your squad. There he is. Yeah, there he is. Which is the coolest
01:56:43.60 --> 01:56:49.36 name ever. Because it spells the riot. I mentioned him earlier. But yeah, he got wounded.
01:56:50.08 --> 01:56:54.24 He was pretty bad. I mean, he was able to get up and walk a couple days after. He was,
01:56:54.24 --> 01:57:00.16 he was so afraid quite a bit. And then Fessie got hit as well. He did. And luckily he had his sunglasses on
01:57:00.16 --> 01:57:06.96 because his face was just blasted. But he still has his vision doing great. He just got engaged.
01:57:06.96 --> 01:57:13.28 So, I mean, yeah, it's just a bad day. You know, my dad, when he says he don't eat and do that stuff,
01:57:13.28 --> 01:57:17.44 he actually was in the hospital with me and he got diverted. He lied us real bad. And he almost died.
01:57:17.44 --> 01:57:21.12 He was so dehydrated. He had to go in and like give him surgery and like get, yeah,
01:57:21.12 --> 01:57:24.40 for six months, he'd probably be mad if I told everybody, but he had to close me back because he
01:57:24.40 --> 01:57:29.12 got so dehydrated. Because he cared, you know, it was just so, so worried some for him.
01:57:31.12 --> 01:57:34.40 And then when I woke up, I was kind of a dick. I didn't want to like, my brother and I was like,
01:57:34.40 --> 01:57:37.76 you got a call, you know, Kelsey, you got a car and mom and dad. And I'm like, I'm not talking anybody.
01:57:37.76 --> 01:57:42.40 You know, as you know, your anger, your set, your question and this got hate me and my bad person.
01:57:42.40 --> 01:57:46.08 What did I do wrong in life to get this? I mean, I pay my taxes, you know, I have a family. Why
01:57:46.08 --> 01:57:49.60 would this happen to me? And then a little bit goes to like four scumboards like with 10
01:57:49.60 --> 01:57:54.72 a day and like, no, what the hell, you know, why did I live through this? Is this some kind of sick
01:57:54.72 --> 01:58:00.24 punishment that for something I did wrong? And I mean, you come to a realization like, hey, you know,
01:58:00.24 --> 01:58:05.28 what? Sometimes bad things happen to good people. It is what it is. You can't change it. You might
01:58:05.28 --> 01:58:09.04 as well keep pushing forward. And it's nothing I did wrong in life. It's just what was slated. So,
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:17.36 you know, as what happened. Yeah, I thought it was interesting. Um, um, that one of the guys on the
01:58:17.36 --> 01:58:25.52 MetaVac bird, like, wrote a wrote a Facebook to Kelsey and was explaining, you know, what it was
01:58:25.52 --> 01:58:34.40 like and and, uh, yeah, I mean, here's what he wrote. My name is first sergeant, wait, the other
01:58:34.40 --> 01:58:40.40 medic, the other flight medic with staff sergeant, Hockersmith, you belong to a family of warriors.
01:58:40.80 --> 01:58:45.12 Other wounded soldiers in the aircraft were injured and screaming, but your husband was more
01:58:45.12 --> 01:58:52.88 more worried about, more worried about then than himself. He described, and then he describes
01:58:52.88 --> 01:58:58.40 like how you were doing the thing and telling him to take his helmet off and, and, uh, you know,
01:58:58.40 --> 01:59:02.08 here, coming back to the book. His face was dirty and there was dust in his eyes, but he never
01:59:02.08 --> 01:59:07.28 shed a tear. I replaced my mind a moment when he looked at the other wounded soldier at another
01:59:07.28 --> 01:59:14.48 wounded soldier and went to re-insure him that it would be okay. My crew is still on duty in his
01:59:14.48 --> 01:59:21.04 units area now. We go back to Kanda Haran Monday, but we won't go back the same way. I'm an E8,
01:59:21.04 --> 01:59:25.04 but this E6 is the example for myself and others to emulate.
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000 And I actually, I had to get my, I was strapped down, so I had to get my arm out,
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.12 because when I was yelling at him, I was like, hey, take a hell off. I said, take a hell off
01:59:35.12 --> 01:59:39.92 that finally, I got my arm off. I'm not sure how you've caught you, man. That's freaking crazy.
01:59:39.92 --> 01:59:45.76 Good genes, I guess. You know, but I pull my arm out and I said, take your, you know, helmet off,
01:59:45.76 --> 01:59:50.40 effort helmet off and I put my hand over my head to motion like, you know, as my arms
01:59:50.40 --> 01:59:54.000 grouping down or whatever, but I just took your helmet off and then he did and I was like,
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.60 give my guys water to him and be fine. And later, I did apologize for yelling at him and I was like,
01:59:57.60 --> 02:00:02.48 I, and he's already held this war. Yeah. You know, but, you know, at that time, I guess,
02:00:02.48 --> 02:00:07.76 maybe it was easier for me to like think about everything else going on except for myself. You know,
02:00:07.76 --> 02:00:13.44 and I just figured it is what it is, whatever's going to happen. It doesn't do me any justice to
02:00:13.44 --> 02:00:18.64 scream out of yell or be afraid. I mean, hey, I can't change what's going on right now. So just
02:00:19.28 --> 02:00:26.16 do it best. I can't, you know, help situation. Yeah. Man. And Josh shows up like, you know,
02:00:26.16 --> 02:00:29.28 you just talked about this and Josh just say, hey, I'm going to tell you straight.
02:00:30.40 --> 02:00:35.36 Because you asked, you said to Josh, hey, am I paralyzed? And I'm going to the book here. No,
02:00:35.36 --> 02:00:40.56 man, Josh said, you're not paralyzed. You don't need to lie to me. I whispered, I can take it.
02:00:41.28 --> 02:00:46.000 I'm going to tell you straight. Josh knew I'd want to know the truth. You're not paralyzed.
02:00:47.04 --> 02:00:53.36 But both your arms and legs are gone. The date was April 14, 2012.
02:00:53.36 --> 02:01:05.44 Still the same day as when I'd heard the news. I was a quadruple amputee. It was my 25th birthday.
02:01:07.44 --> 02:01:13.20 You talk about the pain. And I think this is something people don't get myself included.
02:01:16.24 --> 02:01:20.56 The pain was so bad. Part of the pain was the thought of what I'd become. I could hardly
02:01:20.56 --> 02:01:25.68 picture the new me. Yet the pain was more than emotional. It was the physical pain. It
02:01:25.68 --> 02:01:31.44 caused my body. I felt like I was on fire. I tried to focus on my breathing and take stock of
02:01:31.44 --> 02:01:36.000 why my pain was so bad. Even if all the medications flowing through me, it still felt like I was
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:42.16 in a red hot vice. I could hardly take it. I knew Josh would never lie to me. But my arms and legs
02:01:42.16 --> 02:01:47.04 still felt like they were attached. My hands felt like they were burning. Like someone was clamping
02:01:47.04 --> 02:01:52.72 them inside of an industrial furnace. But my hands weren't there. The flames were eating away my
02:01:52.72 --> 02:01:59.04 ligaments, my nerves, my skin, my legs, my phantom legs were clamped in that same fire.
02:01:59.84 --> 02:02:04.88 Bolts of agony surge from limbs that weren't the register that weren't there and registered to a
02:02:04.88 --> 02:02:10.40 brain that still was. The pain came and went, came and went, came and went.
02:02:10.40 --> 02:02:17.12 Josh started in his seat and leaned or started in his seat and leaned closer. Travis,
02:02:17.12 --> 02:02:21.92 you need me to get the nerves. Nurse, I didn't say anything. I was itchy and sweating bad.
02:02:22.48 --> 02:02:29.36 He pressed a buzzer. Then when I got a cool cloth and laid it on my forehead, the nurse came in and
02:02:29.36 --> 02:02:35.36 up to my morphine. Just before I went under again, everything that I'd always drilled into
02:02:35.36 --> 02:02:41.44 myself rushed through my mind. Never show fear. Never let your guys see you in pain. Don't cry out.
02:02:42.72 --> 02:02:47.04 Even when I'd been lying on the ground right after the blast, I'd felt pain then, but I hadn't
02:02:47.04 --> 02:02:52.80 showed it. When that I view it shoved through my chest, that was painful, but I wasn't going to
02:02:52.80 --> 02:03:00.08 complain then. You don't let people down. You just don't. But this time the pain was so bad. It was
02:03:00.08 --> 02:03:09.44 still so bad, even with more pain killers in me now. So bad, so bad, so bad. This time, I wanted to do
02:03:09.44 --> 02:03:18.32 the unthinkable. Two words rose and began to vocalize within my throat. Josh, I said,
02:03:18.32 --> 02:03:30.80 yeah, what do you need, buddy? I swallowed and whispered two words. I quit.
02:03:33.92 --> 02:03:40.56 Yeah, not good. I don't know what, I mean, this is a lot of pain, I guess. I don't know why,
02:03:42.16 --> 02:03:46.32 you know, you said there any question like, am I going to be a burden on my family?
02:03:46.32 --> 02:03:50.40 Why, how, you know, my wife should she stay with me? I mean, what do I have left to offer?
02:03:51.52 --> 02:03:55.20 My daughter am I going to be a monster when I get to see her finally? And then it's like,
02:03:55.20 --> 02:04:01.60 why did I live through this? Why, why did I make it? Not that I guess angry I lived her at the time
02:04:01.60 --> 02:04:05.52 of, you know, when that was happening. I wasn't so much angry, just more of a question like, why?
02:04:05.52 --> 02:04:09.92 Well, what's the purpose? Why not just let me go up? My wife gets, you know, four and a thousand
02:04:09.92 --> 02:04:14.64 from the government and then she can go remarry and have somebody that's able-bodied and live a happy life.
02:04:14.64 --> 02:04:18.88 But, you know, a lot of questions are, you know, when you're sitting in the hotel room,
02:04:18.88 --> 02:04:22.72 I mean, a hospital bed, you know, in the hospital room and you just got started to see me all the time.
02:04:22.72 --> 02:04:27.44 You just never know what would think. And the military, it's easy. Everything is laid out for you.
02:04:27.44 --> 02:04:30.24 The other mission today is that our plans, what we're going to do is how we're going to get it done.
02:04:30.24 --> 02:04:37.60 There, it's just all unknown. And that pain, like, from missing limbs, it sounds freaking horrible.
02:04:37.60 --> 02:04:43.28 Oh, yeah, I mean, it was like a spike getting drove through my heel, fingernails getting, like, just ripped off and then
02:04:43.28 --> 02:04:48.56 seared and it was just, it would be bad. What causes that? Well, I mean, a lot of it is
02:04:48.56 --> 02:04:53.52 Phantom Limping, so your nerves try to find where your hands and your feet are and if they can't find it,
02:04:53.52 --> 02:04:59.12 they try to redirect and keep trying to find it. So it's just one experience getting, you know,
02:04:59.12 --> 02:05:06.64 zap to another. And then they, you're probably going to talk, they had like, experimental things they
02:05:06.64 --> 02:05:12.48 tried to tell me because it was so bad. And after the second one, they tried, I was like, oh, I feel a
02:05:12.48 --> 02:05:17.12 little better than the doctor, like, was all excited. And I was like, oh, now the pain's back and I'm
02:05:17.12 --> 02:05:22.16 going to, you know, got all yellin out and pain and stuff and he just, he actually cried he felt so bad.
02:05:22.16 --> 02:05:26.40 Because it was to the point where they got to find some cure or I'm going to be so,
02:05:29.44 --> 02:05:36.88 just an agony. Yeah, agony or I'll be so used to the medication that the doses are going to
02:05:36.88 --> 02:05:41.28 get to the point where I'm just going to OD on them, you know, because I'm going to be so, so
02:05:41.28 --> 02:05:44.40 they're custom. I can't think of the word right now. It's killing me. Uh,
02:05:46.08 --> 02:05:50.56 telling me, yeah, yeah, yeah, my tolerance will be so high that I'm just going to end up OD.
02:05:52.24 --> 02:05:58.08 Damn. Of course, you know, you're wondering where you get your sense of humor,
02:05:59.04 --> 02:06:03.28 you're telling your dad what happened to you. Like, I stepped on a mind went flying through the air.
02:06:03.28 --> 02:06:11.92 I did a 180. It was crazy. Well, Travis, my dad said the important question is, did you look good doing it? Yeah.
02:06:11.92 --> 02:06:23.04 Yeah, I mean, I think I did. Yeah. Um, and meanwhile, Kelsey, she, you know, you've been
02:06:23.04 --> 02:06:27.68 voicing some of these concerns like about, hey, can I even be a good dad now? Can I, I'm
02:06:27.68 --> 02:06:32.96 going to be a burden? You're kind of telling Josh some of those things. And she told or he told
02:06:32.96 --> 02:06:37.68 Kelsey, and here we go back to the book. My brother told me that Travis is nervous to see me because he
02:06:37.68 --> 02:06:42.32 doesn't know how I will react or if I will continue to love him as my husband. These worries seem
02:06:42.32 --> 02:06:46.64 so trivial to me, because I will love him through sickness and health until death through us part.
02:06:47.84 --> 02:06:52.88 I'd not use those words lightly when we got married. I will be by his side every day for the
02:06:52.88 --> 02:06:58.32 rest of our lives, whether he likes it or not. I know his natural reaction will be to push me away
02:06:58.32 --> 02:07:03.20 because of embarrassment or feelings of letting me down, but I just wish I could constantly reassure
02:07:03.20 --> 02:07:12.24 him that my love for him is unwavering. Yeah, when I saw her, I told her she should go,
02:07:12.24 --> 02:07:15.44 I said, you know, hey, you should take what we have, the house of yours, the cars of yours,
02:07:15.44 --> 02:07:19.68 sell mine, you know, whatever, and do what you need to do, and I'll financially fund whenever I can.
02:07:20.56 --> 02:07:26.000 You know, and she was like, that's not how this works. I know the hand-to-cat parking,
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:37.20 you know what you said, so sorry. Man, you are, there's like a level of lock involved when you get married.
02:07:37.20 --> 02:07:42.48 I don't care who you are. You know, like, you could easily marry like Satan.
02:07:43.68 --> 02:07:47.92 I know you, I know plenty of guys that have made some really bad. I came and called them bad decisions,
02:07:47.92 --> 02:07:51.76 because it's just like, okay, I understand if you have this great-cording thing and all that,
02:07:51.76 --> 02:07:56.000 and you're whatever, that you can make a good decision, and that's great. But like a lot of
02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:59.20 guys in the military, you're young, and you're like, you know what, we're getting married. And there's
02:07:59.20 --> 02:08:04.80 just like a flip of the coin, and you got a saint. I mean, I literally did, I'm like 17 days in
02:08:04.80 --> 02:08:08.96 person, you know what, it would be great. We just went to Mexico and then it's how we're going to get married,
02:08:08.96 --> 02:08:12.56 and then we just got married. Yeah. Let's do that. Let's be a great story for everybody,
02:08:12.56 --> 02:08:17.76 whether it works or not. Yeah, man. You scored, first year.
02:08:17.76 --> 02:08:25.20 Sure. She got lucky to have me, too. Well, I didn't really pick that up, but um, okay, we'll go with it.
02:08:25.20 --> 02:08:30.08 Yeah, we can. Yeah, we can. Yeah, I wasn't really far close for the first time. So you need to get back
02:08:30.08 --> 02:08:36.88 to Walter Reed. I did. Yeah, I got 17th. I got back. And the first time I got to see Kelsey
02:08:36.88 --> 02:08:40.64 wasn't that home-ark moment, you know, it's like, oh my gosh, I love you so much. It was actually
02:08:41.36 --> 02:08:46.48 I was getting rushed in. I really, one of my right leg ripped open. And like Mrs. Mills,
02:08:46.48 --> 02:08:50.000 you're in charge of medical history now. You have the signs piece of paper. He has to get
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.28 to inches of coffee right leg when you're, you know, consent. She's like, what? She was passes out and
02:08:55.28 --> 02:08:58.72 like Mrs. Mills, I'm like, Kelsey just sign the paper and I'm yelling, just sign the paper. It's okay.
02:08:58.72 --> 02:09:03.20 And she signs it. That's the first time I got to see it. Just real quick. Yep, go ahead and hack them up.
02:09:03.20 --> 02:09:08.08 And they went and took my leg to inches off on the right and resealed it. Next day's when I tell her,
02:09:08.08 --> 02:09:12.56 like, you know, this isn't probably anything that you signed up for. You, you can go, you know,
02:09:12.56 --> 02:09:16.32 you're no, it's no big deal. I'm not worried about it. She's like, nope, not how this works. We'll
02:09:16.32 --> 02:09:20.64 get through it together. And then they, you know, they induce me into this coma later on because the
02:09:20.64 --> 02:09:25.84 pain was so bad. And I was getting my tolerance level built up for the pain meds. And she sat with my bed
02:09:25.84 --> 02:09:29.52 like 20 hours a day and knowing I wasn't going to wake up for five days. Like we're going to put them
02:09:29.52 --> 02:09:34.64 off for five days. So yeah, so this was crazy. Read about in the book, you, you're in such horrible,
02:09:34.64 --> 02:09:41.76 horrible pain. Like undescribable pain. Is this basically an experimental thing procedure that they did on
02:09:41.76 --> 02:09:46.80 you? Yeah, I'm the second, the nation never have the ketamine coma and 30th in the world.
02:09:46.80 --> 02:09:55.20 And Sonic's studies on me. The ketamine coma is 600 milligrams of ketamine per hour.
02:09:55.20 --> 02:10:00.000 Yeah, so it goes around the clock. Mm-hmm. That's a whole thing. Well, it's based on like waiting
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.68 things. So I'm sure like it's different measurements. But they, when they did it, you go in and then
02:10:06.40 --> 02:10:09.52 they just circulates through it. It's supposed to reset your brain to think where your nerve
02:10:09.52 --> 02:10:15.12 Zen is where they end and you know, you come out and it's just you hallucinate like crazy.
02:10:15.12 --> 02:10:19.44 Yeah, and nothing on TV is what was we're alive to me. Yeah, no, I'll hit some highlights from
02:10:19.44 --> 02:10:23.68 your hallucinate because when you get done out of the coma, you're going to come up for five days
02:10:23.68 --> 02:10:29.44 which is just black nothing, right? There's no nothing, nothing there. Then you go into hallucinations.
02:10:29.44 --> 02:10:35.44 You got chasing kids that stole things from Walmart. You got gangascon that you're out with
02:10:35.44 --> 02:10:42.000 gangascon. Your a squat team is coming to get you. You got you and your cousins are writing skateboards
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.64 in a TV reality show. You got yourself playing hockey in the NHL. I was particularly concerned
02:10:48.64 --> 02:10:52.96 about a 50-year-old go-go dancer that crawled on a leash down the hallway of Walter Reed. That one
02:10:52.96 --> 02:11:00.24 made me a little bit nervous. Oh, this is service dog apparently. Cramer from sign-feld stops by.
02:11:00.24 --> 02:11:05.36 So you go through these massive hallucinations. That's freaking weird. Yeah, I mean, it got to
02:11:05.36 --> 02:11:10.56 point where I'd get out of my tangent and they said for the first like seven days, you know,
02:11:10.56 --> 02:11:14.40 it's going to be bad then after that, it'll start to fade out. At ten days, you should be able to tell
02:11:14.40 --> 02:11:19.36 when you're having one or not. But I remember my final come in one morning in the caps game was
02:11:19.36 --> 02:11:22.24 on the night before I was watching it. I was like, I scored nine goals with a little veg. I had
02:11:22.24 --> 02:11:26.80 a triple hat trick. He's like, oh, that's great. And then I thought that way I got blown up.
02:11:26.80 --> 02:11:30.40 And I woke up the very first day. I thought that this guy from my hometown made a
02:11:30.40 --> 02:11:51.20 drug at Torrecomment towards my mom, my wife, my daughter and my buddy's not jumping to car and
02:11:51.20 --> 02:12:01.36 we're just going to go with this. And I called enough my buddy's a message and I'm like, I'm so, I hope you're not dead.
02:12:01.36 --> 02:12:05.92 I finally came out of his nation and I realized what happened to my brother my walk back in. I was like, hey man,
02:12:05.92 --> 02:12:07.28 thanks you dick. Why didn't I tell you any different when I was like, yeah, I understand. You know, that's like,
02:12:07.28 --> 02:12:12.72 don't text when you're drunk or whatever. Don't don't call people leave messages when you're on seven
02:12:12.72 --> 02:12:16.88 day who used to do the trips. I only left two messages and they were trying to best friend. So it was cool.
02:12:16.88 --> 02:12:21.92 And both of them was I'm sorry I killed you. Did I hear me? Oh, we're done. I think I killed you. And then
02:12:21.92 --> 02:12:26.72 I got to the point where I could tell what was going on. So I like I started having another one
02:12:27.84 --> 02:12:31.36 and then I was like, oh, I had hallucination. And then finally I got to the point where I was playing with people.
02:12:31.36 --> 02:12:34.64 Like Josh was in my room and I was like, Josh, because what? I see dead people.
02:12:35.36 --> 02:12:37.12 He said, what? You see or something? I'm just kidding.
02:12:37.92 --> 02:12:39.92 I was like, okay. And that's how I look at the ceiling. He was like,
02:12:40.64 --> 02:12:44.08 all around me. He's like, where? I'm like, oh my gosh, Josh, you're wearing that. Like,
02:12:44.08 --> 02:12:49.12 jad him. And he's like, you're so dumb. So I started messing people once I got the hang of it.
02:12:50.32 --> 02:12:55.44 That's awesome. And that kind of like did it, though, right? Like, yeah. Yeah. So I did about five
02:12:55.44 --> 02:13:00.72 more months of pain pills. And then finally like an October I was home for Thanksgiving and North Carolina
02:13:00.72 --> 02:13:03.92 at my house at Fort Bragg and I was just like, you know what? Kelsey came in. I was out of
02:13:03.92 --> 02:13:08.16 wanting to more him done. She was like, you can't just quit the season. I said, no, I really am done. So
02:13:08.16 --> 02:13:13.84 it was like five days of pain. And then now no medication, nothing I'm good to go. So the kid
02:13:13.84 --> 02:13:18.16 me come one of my documentary, you know, it says, I won't do it again. But that was five months after
02:13:18.16 --> 02:13:22.24 the fact, I was still like doing pain pills and stuff. I were four months after the fact that
02:13:22.24 --> 02:13:27.28 guys could do in September. But looking back like that was the best the best thing for me to get me
02:13:27.28 --> 02:13:32.16 past the, you know, the pain part and then on to my recovery. You have a second person that ever had
02:13:32.16 --> 02:13:37.04 that done. I guess in the nation. That's crazy. I guess. Yeah. Um, other there's a great
02:13:37.04 --> 02:13:42.08 talk about your kind of transition mentally going back to the book back in normal days. I love the
02:13:42.08 --> 02:13:46.000 challenge. The quest to succeed in the army. It always been a challenge for me. My situation
02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:51.84 now is quadruple amputee held the out the same sort of dare to succeed. Sure, if I could have
02:13:51.84 --> 02:13:57.44 changed things, I wouldn't have been in the situation. But I couldn't change things. Being a quadruple
02:13:57.44 --> 02:14:05.04 amputee was my new reality. I could quit for good. I could shut myself off from the world. I could
02:14:05.04 --> 02:14:13.28 will myself to die or I could fight forward and keep on living. I could legit. Well, I mean,
02:14:13.28 --> 02:14:17.04 it came down to a choice at the end of the day. Um, I was still here in my life. I was going to say
02:14:17.04 --> 02:14:20.24 what my side, my daughter, who I think is going to think of a monster, still laughs and snuggles
02:14:20.24 --> 02:14:23.76 up with me. And, you know, I mean, when she first saw me, I thought she was going to be really
02:14:23.76 --> 02:14:27.20 fraili, but then short arm short legs, fuzzy chest, I look like a teddy bear. It was like,
02:14:27.20 --> 02:14:33.04 oh, another toy, you know, but this one can talk. Yeah. Cool. And I've never been
02:14:33.04 --> 02:14:36.32 stern with my mom. I did break my mom's nose one time, the whole different story.
02:14:37.52 --> 02:14:41.68 Karate? I know my dad, me were slapboxed in the kitchen, which meant I was 17. My dad was trying to
02:14:41.68 --> 02:14:44.72 mess with me, but if I slap back, you feel like you did you could take me? And I'm like, no,
02:14:44.72 --> 02:14:48.40 but I thought we were just playing. But he slapped at me. My mom was behind me, and I caught her
02:14:48.40 --> 02:14:55.04 back in my head. Scariest day in my life. Um, you don't make her mad. And, but anyway, so I was only
02:14:55.04 --> 02:14:58.72 stern one time. My mom, I woke up, you know, and I was supposed to get all the rest I could. And I said,
02:14:58.72 --> 02:15:01.76 where's Chloe? Yeah. She's like, oh, they are keen to visit, but you were sleeping. I said, don't
02:15:01.76 --> 02:15:05.60 ever let me sleep to that again. That's the whole reason that I'm able to still keep functioning.
02:15:05.60 --> 02:15:11.20 It's because of my daughter and, you know, being there in my life. But, you know, the mental part was
02:15:11.20 --> 02:15:15.20 the worst. And that four o'clock, just hit clock at night. I couldn't have the lights on in my, in my
02:15:15.20 --> 02:15:19.04 apartment. Something to do. I thought it was like the operating table. I'll start sweating real bad.
02:15:19.68 --> 02:15:24.24 I just, I mean, now I'm fine. But, um, the first, like, you know, five, six months, I was just like,
02:15:24.24 --> 02:15:29.28 no lights at this time. It's quiet out where. And it's like that. And man, I started watching, like, I
02:15:29.28 --> 02:15:32.96 watched a, you know, video view as you were training as you were now re-learning everything.
02:15:32.96 --> 02:15:37.12 Look, and I never really understood when people say, oh, you got to re, you know, got to
02:15:37.12 --> 02:15:40.96 re-learn the walk and you got to re-learn. And I didn't really make sense about it. But it's really
02:15:40.96 --> 02:15:47.60 clear to see when you watch your progression. What that looked like. Like how you were clearly
02:15:47.60 --> 02:15:51.44 re-learning how to walk. Like I never understood that. But when you watch the videos and the
02:15:51.44 --> 02:15:56.48 progression that you made, you can see that that's what it's, it looks like when you first
02:15:56.48 --> 02:16:00.56 stood up, I'm like, oh, yeah, it looks like he's learning how to walk and sure enough. You got
02:16:00.56 --> 02:16:05.12 better and better and it's pretty amazing. And, and two things you're going to find out when I was
02:16:05.12 --> 02:16:08.88 just going to my recovery. The first thing I learned how to walk with my daughter, which was kind
02:16:08.88 --> 02:16:11.84 of cool. They got me those short legs and I was stumbling around and she was stumbling around
02:16:11.84 --> 02:16:16.72 and holding hands. And the next thing you found out my love for Philly Chee Stakes, because I do
02:16:16.72 --> 02:16:21.84 less workouts and stuff like that. The gym, you know, as you go, but I went from 250 to 140.
02:16:21.84 --> 02:16:25.28 And I was real skinny. And then I'll have son, I start getting fatter in fatter in fatter because
02:16:25.28 --> 02:16:29.76 of Lyrka and the medication. And I was like, oh, I love Philly Chee Stakes. So I'm trying to work on
02:16:29.76 --> 02:16:35.84 that now. But my progression is like, I got better. I got fatter too. And you got to visit
02:16:35.84 --> 02:16:42.08 from a guy named Todd Nicely. And that must have helped out a lot. My competitive edge did. He walked
02:16:42.08 --> 02:16:46.08 in on his fake legs and two fake arms and he first thing I had his mouth was, hey man, welcome
02:16:46.08 --> 02:16:50.48 to the club. I was like, I don't mean your club. So kind of late now, don't you think? And I
02:16:50.48 --> 02:16:54.72 looked at myself and I was like, oh, you got me there. And as you walked over, I said, you want
02:16:54.72 --> 02:17:00.48 a ginger ale. And he heard me wrong. And he went over to the counter or the sink. And underneath the
02:17:00.48 --> 02:17:06.000 sink was a 12 pack of ginger ale. I got hooked on it like crack at the hospital. I got off it now.
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:11.28 But either way, he bends down on one knee, bends down on his other knee, reaches on with his fake
02:17:11.28 --> 02:17:15.44 hand, gets it out pops at the top of the other arm and walks over and hands and goes, here you go.
02:17:15.44 --> 02:17:18.88 I'm like, oh, no, I was asking if you wanted one. But before I got the full sentence out,
02:17:18.88 --> 02:17:23.04 I said, how'd you do that? He said, hey man, I'm Todd. And on the second ever, welcome to the club,
02:17:23.04 --> 02:17:28.24 here's the fourth quadruple habitat to make it back home. You're going to be fine. Other Missouri,
02:17:28.24 --> 02:17:34.96 with my wife, I drive, I have a boat, I do whatever I want, I walk, it just takes time. And he's like,
02:17:34.96 --> 02:17:39.36 I'll even work out with you tomorrow. You know, this is like, I'm still thinking I'm in hallucination mode.
02:17:39.36 --> 02:17:45.44 This is like maybe eight, nine days after my, my, uh, ketamine coma. And he's like, I work out with
02:17:45.44 --> 02:17:48.96 you tomorrow. So the doctors come in and I'm like, hey, I got to work out today. I'm like, you can't
02:17:48.96 --> 02:17:53.20 work out. You know, I was like, no, no, seriously, I've been, I'm going to work out with Todd nicely. He said,
02:17:53.20 --> 02:17:56.40 I can work out at one o'clock and I like, well, you're not ready. And I had to let him know, I was like,
02:17:56.40 --> 02:18:01.92 I don't know what you don't get, buddy. I'm working out today. And he said, I'll think about it. So I call him every
02:18:01.92 --> 02:18:06.40 half hour, four hour straight to the find said I could. And I went in the met Todd and Todd did a workout.
02:18:06.40 --> 02:18:10.96 And I laid on my stomach with the pelvis pad on her, my under my stomach or whatever. So the stretch
02:18:10.96 --> 02:18:15.60 my pelvis muscle back out. And he'd been back in a fell asleep 20 minutes. Best work out I've ever done.
02:18:15.60 --> 02:18:23.36 But I started my recovery that day. And as far as the physical is easy, I like the physical challenge.
02:18:23.92 --> 02:18:27.92 The mental was a hardest part for me. I mean, bar none. It was, it was the worst. You know,
02:18:27.92 --> 02:18:30.72 I couldn't look myself in the mirror for a while there. Because I didn't like what I saw.
02:18:30.72 --> 02:18:38.72 You know, seeing my arms gone, the scars just overall messed that that I was. And I was going to be
02:18:38.72 --> 02:18:44.32 burdening all that. So it just, that's just how it went. So the more capable you got, the more comfortable
02:18:44.32 --> 02:18:50.24 you got in your new skin. Yeah. Well, I found out that they let you go for one hour. And then
02:18:50.24 --> 02:18:54.40 a physical therapy and a one hour of occupational therapy. And then let me do another one and another one
02:18:54.40 --> 02:19:00.16 to turn into four hours of each. So eight hours. That's when eight hours a day at the gym in my recovery.
02:19:00.72 --> 02:19:04.80 Well, at the gym and occupational therapy, learn how to use my hands, how to wash myself again,
02:19:04.80 --> 02:19:10.40 how to dress myself again, learn how to drive, learn how to do all that stuff. But it took 19
02:19:10.40 --> 02:19:16.24 months of at Walter Reed 13 months and paperwork was after that to get out. But doubles in.
02:19:20.88 --> 02:19:28.08 And you, you, you, you eventually went and met your guys when they came home. No, that's
02:19:29.12 --> 02:19:34.64 I did an awesome idea. I said some goals. When I was in the hospital, my birthday I called my
02:19:34.64 --> 02:19:38.48 life for my mom and dad and I was basically really short. Hey guys, what's up and fun and love
02:19:38.48 --> 02:19:41.84 you by? That's all I wanted to say. I didn't want to talk to have a conversation and go over what
02:19:41.84 --> 02:19:47.36 happened to me. I kept it very short. But I told my brother and I said, I have to call my guys in my
02:19:47.36 --> 02:19:52.40 unit. You need to find the number to my strong point and let me talk to him. So there's a picture
02:19:52.40 --> 02:19:57.28 going around where I had a baseball cap or an ozone on patrol and I have sleeves rolled up and
02:19:58.32 --> 02:20:02.96 helmet off sunglasses. I mean, everything out of standard as they, you know, they have standards or whatever.
02:20:03.52 --> 02:20:06.40 And I got to hold my sergeant major and I said sergeant major, I'm so sorry. I understand if you
02:20:06.40 --> 02:20:10.16 got to take my rank. I shouldn't have been out of uniform. I do apologize and now the pictures
02:20:10.16 --> 02:20:14.96 were on public and he's like, you're crazy dude. Just get better. You're fine. And then I got to
02:20:14.96 --> 02:20:19.60 hold my my guys and I told them guys I'm fine. I'll be okay. And I'll be there when you get back
02:20:19.60 --> 02:20:24.88 from Afghanistan. I'll be there at the, you know, the ramp to give you guys a hug on my tall legs.
02:20:24.88 --> 02:20:28.56 And it took me a while. I got my tall legs that morning when they got back. I had to work out
02:20:28.56 --> 02:20:33.12 three hours and then the tall legs don't bend but like that wasn't wearing out but they make me
02:20:33.12 --> 02:20:37.28 at least six foot tall at well. You can't take those legs home unless you can stand up when you fall
02:20:37.28 --> 02:20:41.76 down. So the whole day the therapist walks up and says trust fall, they knock you down. You know,
02:20:41.76 --> 02:20:45.20 what the hell? Like that's not a trust fall. Just push the catch me. That's supposed to close my eyes
02:20:45.20 --> 02:20:48.16 and trust you're going to catch me. You're like, that's the catch. You got to give yourself back up.
02:20:48.96 --> 02:20:53.20 The therapist's are great. No, I had, I had two of the best therapists that you could ask for.
02:20:53.20 --> 02:20:57.12 No, I'm carryin' Joe and I got me, you know, back to where I was at. But I did meet my guys
02:20:57.52 --> 02:21:01.20 and the first, the first time I got to hug was Doc Bateson. You know, it's a hey man. Thanks for
02:21:01.20 --> 02:21:08.64 all you did. And then you end up doing a 5k. 5k run. So, I mean, that was another goal.
02:21:08.64 --> 02:21:13.04 Yeah, so Todd Niceer came in when he met me. He had four firefighters also for telling the
02:21:13.04 --> 02:21:17.68 towers 5k they do in New York City and they also, they partnered with Gary Snees and they built
02:21:17.68 --> 02:21:21.60 houses and things like that for guys that have been through traumatic injuries and they were like,
02:21:21.60 --> 02:21:25.60 hey, we're gonna have a 5k and September, we'll push you and I'll walk it and they're like,
02:21:25.60 --> 02:21:28.96 well, yeah, but like, we'll push you as no big deal. I was like, no, you know what I'm saying?
02:21:28.96 --> 02:21:32.88 Like, I'm just gonna walk it. And like, well, you don't have legs yet, but if you do walk it, that's cool.
02:21:32.88 --> 02:21:38.08 So, I went out to New York City after my daughter's birthday the day after and walked the 5k.
02:21:38.80 --> 02:21:41.76 I came out of the Brooklyn Battle of Tunnel thinking, okay, I'm gonna sit down now. Like, I'm
02:21:41.76 --> 02:21:46.000 tired, I'm a back hurts, I got a mile, you know, 1.2 miles or something to go. By right leg
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.44 I completely rubbed raw, I was bleeding inside my socket and I was like, it's good. I've met a goal.
02:21:51.44 --> 02:21:58.08 I've walked over to, you know, two miles now. And I came out of the tunnel, there was 343 firefighters
02:21:58.08 --> 02:22:01.84 with banners around their neck for 9-11 at the G's, okay. Well, if those guys didn't go out,
02:22:01.84 --> 02:22:05.44 they were going to go down the flight stairs and then ultimately die, you know, trying to save
02:22:05.44 --> 02:22:10.56 life, so I could finish this. So I did. I was soar, it was bad, but I didn't finish it.
02:22:10.56 --> 02:22:17.60 And then, eventually, you're like you said, you're driving now. You went out and did like
02:22:17.60 --> 02:22:24.16 mountain biking and skiing and all this other kind of just getting after it basically for
02:22:24.16 --> 02:22:30.48 better, for lack of a better term. And then you retire, you retire from the, from the army.
02:22:31.20 --> 02:22:35.68 And what's your next move? Your next move is you figure out, you're gonna get a house and you're
02:22:35.68 --> 02:22:41.44 gonna move to. I had to move to Maine. My wife is from Maine, originally. The heat doesn't do well with
02:22:41.44 --> 02:22:45.92 amputees because your blood circulates faster. He comes back warmer. When you're really
02:22:45.92 --> 02:22:49.60 seat from your body, it's head hands of feet, so I'm missing, you know, four or the five and then
02:22:49.60 --> 02:22:53.60 my legs are capped off. So if I wear pants or if I wear shorts, it's the same. There's no
02:22:53.60 --> 02:22:59.76 air hitting the third of my body. And yeah, so we decided we're gonna move to Maine. We didn't start
02:22:59.76 --> 02:23:05.04 an on-profit to help with care packages at first, and then we grew it to the retreat center that we
02:23:05.04 --> 02:23:11.12 have here in Maine. And really through my work at Walter Reed, when I was at Walter Reed, I was such
02:23:11.12 --> 02:23:14.88 up the person. I was the same person as before the blast. I was still going in and have Keshia
02:23:14.88 --> 02:23:20.32 Fridays because I made people annoyed, but other people loved it. I haven't walked Friday. Keshia
02:23:20.32 --> 02:23:25.52 Fridays. I'd go put my take my phone and turn on Keshia on Pandora and we'd just rock out.
02:23:26.16 --> 02:23:29.60 And the reason I unfortunately saw videos of you dancing,
02:23:30.24 --> 02:23:36.72 cannot be unseen apparently. Burning to your right now, you're welcome. But, you know, they
02:23:36.72 --> 02:23:40.80 started asking me if I'd meet people upstairs and it started out, hey, you know, Travis, we have a guy
02:23:40.80 --> 02:23:43.76 upstairs. I can't tell his name or his room number, but if you could talk to him, really help,
02:23:43.76 --> 02:23:48.000 he's not in 41 and he's not in 43. But if you could find him, you know, and I'm not in
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:53.44 Marine. So, you know, obviously I'm smart enough to find that there's number 42. I don't eat crayons.
02:23:54.08 --> 02:23:58.72 But anyway, so I would go up and talk to him and then that turned into like, hey, we have PFC
02:23:58.72 --> 02:24:03.44 Johnson. He's missing two legs. His mom is mother-in-law. His two kids are here. Can you go see him?
02:24:03.44 --> 02:24:08.56 I told him you'd be up around this time. And that's how the book got started. My documentary
02:24:08.56 --> 02:24:11.84 got started and then the foundation, which is because all the nonprofits that Walter Reed
02:24:11.84 --> 02:24:15.44 doing great things, Kelsey and I wanted to give back. Some way, she had performed and this is how
02:24:15.44 --> 02:24:23.28 we've decided, you know, that we can get back the best. So, I'm what tell, tell us more about the
02:24:23.28 --> 02:24:28.08 foundation there. So the Travis Mose Foundation was started, really just for care packages overseas.
02:24:28.08 --> 02:24:32.32 And then I went out to Colorado, and I go downhill mountain biking and doing things. And then I
02:24:32.32 --> 02:24:37.04 realized that Walter Reed does a great job of taking the service member out there. The only thing that
02:24:37.04 --> 02:24:42.56 the government doesn't lack, but because of the funds have to go to the soldiers, they don't
02:24:42.56 --> 02:24:46.56 get to bring all the families. My wife got to go because I needed assistance. And things,
02:24:46.56 --> 02:24:50.56 but a lot of the guys that could take care of themselves couldn't bring their loved ones. And that's fine.
02:24:50.56 --> 02:24:56.32 That's okay. But we thought we could do something in that space. My whole reason for getting better
02:24:56.32 --> 02:25:01.84 was my wife and my daughter easily. So we started bringing families out. We did it for one week
02:25:01.84 --> 02:25:05.84 of a year. And we brought families out and show them how to do things adaptively. Kaya can canoe and
02:25:05.84 --> 02:25:10.000 things. Then we did another one and it went so well with what we should buy properties. We bought a
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:15.04 property. It's supposed to be a $500,000 project. Now's the $3 million project. We did our first
02:25:15.04 --> 02:25:20.08 week of program. I mean, first year of programs this year. We did seven weeks, 56 families. And
02:25:20.08 --> 02:25:24.80 we bring them up. We host eight families per week up to 40 people and we show them how to do things.
02:25:24.80 --> 02:25:28.88 We have a place on the water for kayaking and canoeing and tubing and boating. And we just
02:25:29.84 --> 02:25:34.64 do horseback riding and archery and all these activities. We have ropes course. And we just say,
02:25:34.64 --> 02:25:37.92 you know what, I understand what you're going through. I understand it can get tough. Here's a
02:25:37.92 --> 02:25:42.16 network of people that are just like you. Whether you live in Chicago and in inner city or you live
02:25:42.16 --> 02:25:46.40 in the plains of Montana, reach out. Understand that these families are going through the same thing.
02:25:47.04 --> 02:25:51.04 Feel comfortable when you come here. That you can fall out of a kayak and nobody's going to
02:25:51.04 --> 02:25:56.88 freak out. They're going to understand what you're going through. And it's just as much of a place for
02:25:56.88 --> 02:26:02.000 the loved ones. You know, the wives that can talk to other wives or spouses and the kids can run
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.28 around see that you know what my dad has one leg missing and one arm. But this dad has two legs missing.
02:26:07.28 --> 02:26:11.36 And that's pretty cool because they know what we're going through. And after our first year of
02:26:11.36 --> 02:26:14.72 operations and running, it was such a great success. We're going to do strategic partnership with
02:26:14.72 --> 02:26:19.28 other nonprofits that share our mission and they'll donate what it costs for a week and they'll
02:26:19.28 --> 02:26:24.64 run their own retreats up here as well. So we're talking up with Goal Some of our families
02:26:24.64 --> 02:26:30.88 as well as PTSD and TBI because right now I focus on limb loss or paralysation. But this hopefully
02:26:30.88 --> 02:26:36.24 will run 40 or 45 weeks out of the year. It's all donation based and the cool thing is like as the
02:26:36.24 --> 02:26:40.48 president and the six other board members I do have, we don't take a dime. We never will. We're
02:26:40.48 --> 02:26:45.12 auditing ourselves right now. So we can go on the CFC, the combined federal campaign and tell a lot
02:26:45.12 --> 02:26:51.12 given back. So it's been really rewarding and fulfilling and I'm glad to be out there helping these
02:26:51.12 --> 02:26:55.44 families cope with their situation and telling that there's other people out there like you
02:26:55.44 --> 02:26:59.52 keep going, never live life on the sidelines and it most importantly never give up and never quit.
02:27:00.64 --> 02:27:04.80 If people want to help this organization, what's the best way for them to do that?
02:27:04.80 --> 02:27:09.20 Visit the website Travis Mills.org. It has all the information on the foundation. It has
02:27:09.20 --> 02:27:14.56 ways to donate online. There's ways to do volunteer options. We had people fly in just a volunteer
02:27:14.56 --> 02:27:19.60 for the week and help us out. And there's also ways to do corporate sponsorships. We had
02:27:19.60 --> 02:27:24.56 wayfair come in, donate all the furniture, new balance came in, donated to us and things like that.
02:27:24.56 --> 02:27:29.44 So we're growing. We believe in our mission. We know we can do this and there's other things we
02:27:29.44 --> 02:27:34.56 want to get accomplished out here. We need to build a multi-purpose center. We have a pool going in
02:27:34.56 --> 02:27:39.12 and things like that. But it's all about giving back and the mindset of the service member that
02:27:39.12 --> 02:27:46.88 we're trying to host and the family. The book, Tophas, they come. That's what we read today.
02:27:47.60 --> 02:27:55.28 It's a great book. I read a small chunks of it. Yeah, you can pick that up anywhere, where they sell
02:27:55.28 --> 02:28:00.80 books. And what about the documentary? So the documentary, it's called Travis, the Soldier Story.
02:28:00.80 --> 02:28:07.44 It was done in 2014. And it was actually unveiled the GI film festival. And we took first place
02:28:07.44 --> 02:28:11.52 in 55 short films. I got to meet Marcus and Melanie LaTrell at night. It was really,
02:28:11.52 --> 02:28:16.96 really great to meet them. And now Netflix is sign-to-son for a two-year run. So we got on Netflix
02:28:16.96 --> 02:28:20.64 and May. So if we want to watch that, it's on Netflix. It's called Travis, Soldier Story.
02:28:21.68 --> 02:28:26.000 And it just tells a whole story. It just has iPhone footage of everything that Kelsey and I went through.
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.48 Yes. And the two-medic says, cool. The two-medic say my life. I actually are reenacting. You
02:28:30.48 --> 02:28:34.08 getting blown up. And the two guys got hurt. Are in the documentary as well. And my brother-in-law,
02:28:34.08 --> 02:28:38.88 so I'll tell people that were there in the documentary. No, between the book and watching the documentary,
02:28:38.88 --> 02:28:43.92 you get to see the faces and everything. It's really cool. It's really powerful. And
02:28:45.20 --> 02:28:50.96 what about social media? How's your social media presence? It's not yours.
02:28:50.96 --> 02:28:57.12 So, by any means, we're about 60,000 in some strong on our Facebook page. I do little videos.
02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.36 My daughter learned how to tie her shoes the other day. We taught her in the morning. And you know,
02:29:01.36 --> 02:29:04.80 by like we taught her like seven to my nine o'clock, she's tying it by herself. Give it an intro.
02:29:05.52 --> 02:29:10.24 To tying your shoes online. But just SSG, Travis Mills is my page. If you want to check it out,
02:29:10.24 --> 02:29:15.04 share my story that really helps. And it's Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. You're on all three.
02:29:15.04 --> 02:29:26.48 SSG, Travis Mills. That's where you can find it. Yeah. You know, you put the last thing in the book,
02:29:26.48 --> 02:29:32.48 like the last line in the book. You said, 11 freedom to go forward, to love your family,
02:29:32.48 --> 02:29:39.52 to make something out of your life, to never ever give up, to never quit. That success.
02:29:39.52 --> 02:29:50.80 And obviously, in my opinion, if never giving up and never quitting is the definition of success,
02:29:50.80 --> 02:29:54.32 then I think you're the most successful person I've ever met my life brother.
02:29:54.32 --> 02:29:59.04 For real. Well, I appreciate that. I just, we realize that people that depend on you,
02:29:59.04 --> 02:30:03.20 the people that went into all this and the lives that are lost. I mean, you've had a lot of bodies.
02:30:03.20 --> 02:30:09.36 I'm sure they did make it back home. My situation is not life-ending. My situation is just
02:30:09.36 --> 02:30:14.24 I got a couple more steps in the morning for my legs on, come on, take my daughter, tomorrow's
02:30:14.24 --> 02:30:17.60 actually my daughter's orientation at school. I get to take her. My wife and I just had a baby.
02:30:18.64 --> 02:30:22.000 And I named her, I named her a little boy after my two medics. His name's Dex,
02:30:22.40 --> 02:30:25.92 D.A.X. After Daniel N. Alexander for the medics at St. My Life. So,
02:30:26.56 --> 02:30:31.20 thankful to still be here, through all this smoking and dirt in the dust. It's all settled now.
02:30:31.20 --> 02:30:34.88 And I'm living life to the fullest and doing the best I can to make sure that people understand
02:30:34.88 --> 02:30:42.08 life goes on and to never, ever give up and never quit. Anything else? Any closing thoughts?
02:30:42.08 --> 02:30:46.08 I mean, I just obviously want to thank everybody when to this. I mean, from my unit on the ground,
02:30:46.08 --> 02:30:50.48 I know I was a heavy guy. Walk around, wait 400 pounds. I'd get, you know, with all my gear on.
02:30:50.48 --> 02:30:54.32 And all that to get me out there was great. The medical staff, doctors, nurses,
02:30:55.28 --> 02:30:59.76 physical therapists, occupational therapists, everybody. I obviously my family went into it. I want to say
02:30:59.76 --> 02:31:05.12 thanks for being there on my side. My beautiful life and my wonderful children for, you know, really
02:31:05.12 --> 02:31:09.84 accepting what happened and moving forward in life. And just, you know, there by no, you know,
02:31:09.84 --> 02:31:13.36 you can't always affect your situation, find yourself in, but you always can affect your attitude.
02:31:13.36 --> 02:31:18.72 And that's, that's where I find the most, uh, I guess the most realization in my situation. I can't
02:31:18.72 --> 02:31:22.96 always affect, if I drop something on my hand, you know, I can't pick it up right away or I have to
02:31:22.96 --> 02:31:27.68 do something weird and get mad about it because getting mad doesn't, I'm getting mad doesn't do anything.
02:31:27.68 --> 02:31:32.08 So I always try to keep my attitude positive and keep pushing forward. But thanks for having me.
02:31:32.08 --> 02:31:35.52 Also, I want to thank you for having me on here. Both of you, I didn't look at you very much.
02:31:35.52 --> 02:31:38.56 I'm sorry. I know we talked about this earlier, but he said not you said not to you.
02:31:39.20 --> 02:31:42.32 Yeah, yeah, I'm trying not to. That's it. That's your discretion for sure.
02:31:44.16 --> 02:31:49.28 I gotta redo this and it's like I look at you more. Okay, but perfect. Perfect. Yeah, man.
02:31:49.28 --> 02:31:56.32 Thanks for coming on. Of course, thank you for your service to this great nation.
02:31:56.32 --> 02:32:02.64 Not only is a soldier and a leader on the battlefield, but for your continued service that you're
02:32:02.64 --> 02:32:11.28 doing today for veterans and also for the gift that I think you give everybody that
02:32:11.84 --> 02:32:20.32 here's about you or comes in contact with you in any way. And that is just a living example
02:32:20.32 --> 02:32:31.84 of grit and of determination and of will. And I just think you're the absolute model of
02:32:32.88 --> 02:32:42.08 what it means and what people can accomplish. If we do as you say and that is to go forward,
02:32:42.08 --> 02:32:54.24 never give up, never, ever quit. Thanks for coming on, brother. Thanks for having me. And after a
02:32:54.24 --> 02:33:07.52 little administrative break, Travis has left the building pretty damn awesome to have him on man.
02:33:07.52 --> 02:33:16.64 Yeah. Yeah. Any and every excuse that a person might have is human being.
02:33:17.76 --> 02:33:29.36 Just got destroyed. Yeah. Yeah, and he really kind of illustrated how hard it got spread the
02:33:29.36 --> 02:33:34.96 time when he was like when he said, oh, I quit in the hospital. Yeah. And it's kind of like,
02:33:34.96 --> 02:33:40.48 it makes just kind of when you're around them now and you see just how he is. It kind of really
02:33:40.48 --> 02:33:50.40 brings to light how good he is now. Yeah. And he couldn't at that moment in time.
02:33:52.24 --> 02:33:58.88 And when people get into that darkness, they don't see. They can't, they can't see the future.
02:33:58.88 --> 02:34:01.84 They can't see that things are going to get better. They can't see. You know, for him at that point in
02:34:01.84 --> 02:34:08.40 time, there's no way it was going to get good. Yeah. You know, so yeah, that's very true. Very true.
02:34:08.40 --> 02:34:14.16 Yeah, another interesting thing is that when you see again where he's like concerned about his
02:34:14.16 --> 02:34:19.68 man. And even when he said I quit, he was concerned about like his wife. Yeah. And like that was the
02:34:19.68 --> 02:34:28.48 significant element. Just totally selfless person. Awesome. Well,
02:34:28.48 --> 02:34:31.84 speaking of
02:34:38.40 --> 02:34:45.60 being awesome. Yeah. Echo Charles. We're awesome. We think we can talk about some
02:34:45.60 --> 02:34:50.72 awesome American made stuff. That's a good idea. I like where you call it this. Origin.
02:34:50.72 --> 02:34:59.44 Origin. Origin. But yeah, Origin. That's the brand. So what is Origin? We're in league with origin.
02:34:59.44 --> 02:35:05.60 I like the expression in league with, by the way. I might have told you that before. Yeah. It's a good
02:35:05.60 --> 02:35:13.84 way of putting it. Yeah. So this is straight up the best American made apparel in the world.
02:35:13.84 --> 02:35:17.92 You can, you don't have to say the best American made apparel. You can say it's the best
02:35:17.92 --> 02:35:24.000 apparel in the world. And it's American made. Yeah. Is that subjective? I guess it's kind of
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:30.32 subjective. But if you say it's the best American made. Well, I guess it all technically might be.
02:35:30.32 --> 02:35:35.84 I don't know either way. It's dope. Yeah. And it's all made in America. But here's the thing about
02:35:35.84 --> 02:35:41.28 made in America. I guess I don't know. I could be wrong about this part. But technically you could be like,
02:35:41.28 --> 02:35:46.000 yeah, they, they sold these, I don't know, pants or whatever, you know, in America.
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.20 Like, hey, where'd you get the material? Oh, well, you know, we got it from somewhere else,
02:35:51.20 --> 02:35:56.72 not in America. Which I guess is cool. Technically it was made. It was crafted of, but not here.
02:35:58.48 --> 02:36:04.24 So you figure what? Like, let's say you're cotton pants. Right? You get the
02:36:05.20 --> 02:36:12.96 material from America. But how do you make the material? The actual cotton, where does cotton come from?
02:36:12.96 --> 02:36:19.04 You grow it. I used to have a cotton like trees like a bunch of them. By the way, I'm quite none the less.
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.08 So where do they get? Where does origin get that cotton? America.
02:36:26.08 --> 02:36:32.80 What about the seeds to plant the cotton? They're from America. For sure. So straight up from the ground.
02:36:32.80 --> 02:36:40.24 See from the earth from the seeds to the pants that you get in the event of you getting pants.
02:36:40.24 --> 02:36:46.16 Yeah, the way. There's other stuff. There's geese. And now, it's a good one. The geese. If you're into
02:36:46.16 --> 02:36:52.16 jujitsu, nonetheless, the pants that I got, the joggers, he was asking me, how do you like those?
02:36:52.72 --> 02:36:56.96 And, you know, the new joggers, they're kind of like, they have a different shape than the old school
02:36:56.96 --> 02:37:02.64 sweatpants. So I was like, okay, you know, and I looked into those. I was telling Pete this story. Where
02:37:02.64 --> 02:37:10.40 I ordered some ironically from overseas. I ordered them from overseas. They looked pretty good.
02:37:10.40 --> 02:37:14.96 So I ordered them. Didn't come in, by the way. This was about a year and a half ago. Still didn't come in.
02:37:14.96 --> 02:37:18.40 By the way, but I looked into it. I was like, whatever. But it's probably not for me.
02:37:18.40 --> 02:37:23.28 So I let it, you know, it's a sign. One of those deals either way. I get Pete's one. So I'm like,
02:37:23.28 --> 02:37:30.32 all right, cool. I'm going to try these. I put them on. Surprisingly, legitimate. As far as the look goes
02:37:30.32 --> 02:37:35.44 cool, it's me. Pete even said that I'm like, I look good in them, which is a lot because I just kind of met
02:37:35.44 --> 02:37:42.80 Pete in person over the past week. Anyway, good stuff. Just saying it's good stuff. And again,
02:37:42.80 --> 02:37:49.04 all made in America, all of it. Some keys on there, some cool rash guards. The George Washington rash
02:37:49.04 --> 02:37:54.96 guard, that I feel like we're ready for that one to come back. So yeah. So Pete should, yeah,
02:37:54.96 --> 02:38:02.48 you'd have that one. Yeah. Then the last origin, main.com. I want to say main. It's the state
02:38:02.48 --> 02:38:07.92 main. So origin, M.A. I. Any dot com. That's a good one. The best one. Really, when it comes down
02:38:07.92 --> 02:38:20.80 to it, also, jocco has some supplements. Crill oil, which we need. Enjoy more fair. So really,

02:39:09.60 --> 02:39:13.04 In the event of people not knowing that we're on a trip to Maine, I didn't bring the kettle
02:39:13.04 --> 02:39:18.48 wells. I thought that that might have been too much plus, you know, to check on Kelly,
02:39:18.48 --> 02:39:22.80 they give you 50 pounds, right in your luggage. My kettlebell is one. You had about more than 50 pounds.

02:39:32.24 --> 02:39:38.80 math on point. There was a guy at the camp that we went to that brought the kettlebells. The
02:39:38.80 --> 02:39:45.36 70, whatever, what in the grill on one from on it, the cool one. I didn't, I didn't work out with them.
02:39:45.36 --> 02:39:54.24 I was gonna. I wanted to. I intended to. Anyway, those grill out and where we'll
02:39:54.24 --> 02:39:58.88 kettlebells that I'm talking about, these are the cool kettlebells. They're from on it. Those are.
02:40:01.28 --> 02:40:05.76 All kettlebells are good. Really. But if you want that level up of coolness,

02:40:22.64 --> 02:40:26.88 Not you, you don't get bored. No. You just like, well, it doesn't matter. Right.
02:40:26.88 --> 02:40:30.48 It doesn't even register bored or not. Yeah, execution is happening. So no, what is the
02:40:30.48 --> 02:40:34.64 well, yeah. Well, some of us who get kind of bored and it's not that we're getting bored, so we're not
02:40:34.64 --> 02:40:40.72 gonna do it. We're looking for something like, oh, yeah, let me try this new thing.
02:40:40.72 --> 02:40:45.04 Some new hotness in regards to workouts. Can you just not say new hotness anymore?
02:40:45.04 --> 02:40:48.24 High spot kind of spreads. I heard Will Smith say it. You know, one of the, one of the,
02:40:48.24 --> 02:40:53.04 one of the, that was cool. It doesn't like certify it for the podcast. I know, but I figured I'd try it
02:40:53.04 --> 02:40:57.84 out though. Just no. It's, it's been, it's been tried. It's been, no. Next, rejected. Oh, yeah.
02:40:57.84 --> 02:41:03.12 All right. If you want some new cool stuff to do, interview our tour workout. Hey, Ben, look,

02:41:07.52 --> 02:41:13.12 videos on there. By the way, don't get addicted to the website. Spin appropriate amounts of time on
02:41:13.12 --> 02:41:17.20 the website, not too much. Remember how you're talking about like, you know, when you watch a video
02:41:17.20 --> 02:41:23.28 on YouTube and another one pops up. Yeah. No, six of them pop up. Yeah, all formulated for you.
02:41:23.28 --> 02:41:27.84 I know, especially picked. What's up for that? We're YouTube, munchkins that are like,
02:41:27.84 --> 02:41:32.72 saying, I know what to call likes. Yeah. That's actually one of the street fights. That's
02:41:32.72 --> 02:41:38.56 two. It's a cycle. Anyway, just watch out for that on the website on the, on the, on the, on
02:41:38.56 --> 02:41:43.04 it website because the videos are real interesting. But they're about work out to the, a lot of them.
02:41:43.04 --> 02:41:47.60 So it's kind of, it's kind of a catch 22. Watch a video about working out. There's not replaced
02:41:47.60 --> 02:41:51.68 working out though. No, no, no. No, no. No, no. You gotta get after it for sure. But a lot of
02:41:51.68 --> 02:41:56.24 options on there. Anyway, on it.com slash jockel. That's the one right there. Also,
02:41:57.44 --> 02:42:04.88 you know what, in this camp? So some guys came to the camp. They brought this 200 pound
02:42:06.48 --> 02:42:13.36 bag of, he said it was sandbag, but it's like gravel essentially. And the challenge is
02:42:15.52 --> 02:42:20.16 to pick it up over your shoulder, 200 pounds. So even that really, I mean,
02:42:20.16 --> 02:42:28.32 that's not that easy 200, but the way, when they're explaining it to me, it was Mike
02:42:29.12 --> 02:42:35.52 Gerard Brian Victor. They were explained to me. Well, while they're explaining it to me,
02:42:36.24 --> 02:42:41.28 I'm thinking, okay, I know what a 150 pound dumbbell feels like when you lift it up.
02:42:44.24 --> 02:42:48.72 And I'm thinking, could I get that? And that has a handle and balance, by the way. Something like
02:42:48.72 --> 02:42:54.16 shoot could do I that I meant? I don't know if I could do that. Could I do that? And then they're like,
02:42:54.16 --> 02:42:59.28 oh yeah, you know, like, I've done it. And I'm okay. So it can be done. Like, it's obviously not like
02:42:59.28 --> 02:43:05.28 this thing. You need years of practice, whatever. So I was like, but man, I don't know. And then
02:43:05.28 --> 02:43:09.52 sure enough. So yeah, when I went and did it, it was like, it was hard. I failed the first one.
02:43:09.52 --> 02:43:14.48 I probably you bring it up. You kind of bring it onto your lap. It's 200 pounds, man. That's not like,
02:43:14.48 --> 02:43:20.000 it's like, you know how you say when you when you pick up a person and they're just dead weight,
02:43:21.44 --> 02:43:26.24 similar to that. Anyway, boom, failed the first time. They're cheering me on. Thanks for that,
02:43:26.24 --> 02:43:30.88 by the way, guys, that helped me. And then the second time I did it, it was, it was good.
02:43:31.52 --> 02:43:36.64 One of the high points. Anyway, that was just a side note. Also. Just to, so bump on to people
02:43:36.64 --> 02:43:41.44 don't have to ask me, yeah, I did not participate in the challenge. I have an injured rib. That was
02:43:41.44 --> 02:43:45.52 that. Yeah, you were real happy about that. You're still not happy to see it on your face, man. Yeah.
02:43:47.52 --> 02:43:54.56 Yeah. So the ribs almost healed. Thanks, Andy. That was Andy. Andy did that to my ribs.
02:43:54.56 --> 02:44:00.000 In a way. And this is, I think you paid a bigger price than me, but you messed up my rib in
02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:05.84 identical way a few months ago. Oh, you were going to get a submission on me. And then
02:44:05.84 --> 02:44:11.76 you hurt yourself? No, I was trying to. I was escaping the submission. Well, essentially the same
02:44:11.76 --> 02:44:16.40 situation, but instead this time you got the rib injury instead of the guy you're trying to
02:44:16.40 --> 02:44:21.68 tap out. So yeah, so in a way, good for you, you know, and I hope you weave all learning something
02:44:21.68 --> 02:44:30.80 from this whole thing today. Anyway, also, when you buy this book and you will and should

02:46:33.44 --> 02:46:38.72 I'm subscribed. Yes. Right. So they're a little augmented videos that you make with your creative
02:46:40.08 --> 02:46:46.56 spin on them. Yeah. There's just straight excerpts. Right. And then there's a deleted scenes.
02:46:46.56 --> 02:46:51.60 Yeah. Deleted scenes. I think I'm put some more on there. There's a few. You know what? When you kind of
02:46:51.60 --> 02:46:57.20 go through and I want, you know, when I edit it, right? So really the edit the audio editing process
02:46:57.20 --> 02:47:02.56 pretty simple. You cut off the beginning. You cut off the end. You faded and you faded out.
02:47:02.56 --> 02:47:10.40 Done. That's it. Easy. Yeah. But the parts that I cut off, there's some, some nuggets and
02:47:10.40 --> 02:47:14.40 interesting stuff. And you know, when you're in the in the moment, I'm talking to you. It's just
02:47:14.40 --> 02:47:18.40 regular, we're just talking and whatever. Maybe we're laughing maybe not. But when you kind of go back
02:47:18.40 --> 02:47:23.92 and listen to it, it's kind of funny. Anyway, I'll put some of those on there too. So yeah, if you
02:47:23.92 --> 02:47:28.24 subscribe to the YouTube channel, you can watch those. Those are cool. The excerpts are just kind of like,
02:47:28.24 --> 02:47:34.56 you know, shareable, smaller, you know, nuggets of juggle wisdom. Which is cool. I mean, you know,
02:47:34.56 --> 02:47:38.80 if you don't want to listen to the whole podcast, just for the thing. In fact, there's a couple of
02:47:38.80 --> 02:47:42.40 people who were there like, yeah, I listened to those. They, the guy had to camp. He was like, yeah,
02:47:42.40 --> 02:47:46.80 I listened to those excerpts. I almost every day. Yeah. Because they're like, yeah, there's a lot of
02:47:46.80 --> 02:47:55.76 them there now, too. By the way, also juggle as a store. It's called juggle store. Juggle store.com. There's
02:47:55.76 --> 02:48:02.40 some shirts on there. If you want to support. So I'm not saying by sure. I'm not saying by a hat,
02:48:02.80 --> 02:48:07.84 got hats on there now. Snap back snap back. My bad. I thought they were. Heck, like,
02:48:07.84 --> 02:48:12.24 those were, you know, I go thought it was FlexFit. Trucker hats. They're an exist. Yeah, they don't.
02:48:12.24 --> 02:48:16.64 Doesn't have those in the world. Doesn't need them. Yeah. It almost doesn't make sense. Yeah.
02:48:16.64 --> 02:48:21.28 Oh, maybe. I don't know. I've for real thought they're FlexFit. But you know what? I looked into it.
02:48:21.28 --> 02:48:27.52 And I realized that the reason that I thought they're FlexFit is because some new hats,
02:48:27.52 --> 02:48:33.28 some coming out with. Oh, maybe in a few weeks, they're like, they're a different style of hat
02:48:33.28 --> 02:48:39.20 and their FlexFit. They look dope, too, by the way. I'll show them to you one day. Cool. So yeah,
02:48:39.20 --> 02:48:43.60 I'm not saying, hey, I'm not saying, hey, by a shirt, by a rashguard or whatever, I'm saying,
02:48:43.60 --> 02:48:51.60 go on the store. Juggle store. Look on there. Check out the items. If you like something,
02:48:52.48 --> 02:48:58.000 get something. Somewhere, these on there, some women's dust on patches, which are cool. I've seen a
02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:02.08 few of those. When people's backpack's actually look kind of dope, I'm going to probably put
02:49:02.08 --> 02:49:07.44 one on my backpack. And you know, I'm just letting us all know. I'm about to, you know,
02:49:07.44 --> 02:49:10.72 sometimes you just think, think about loud. Definitely. I'm curious about that.
02:49:11.68 --> 02:49:16.000 Well, I'll be looking forward to you. Yeah. Yeah. I'll show it to you. And it's done. Anyway,
02:49:17.12 --> 02:49:22.32 Juggle store.com. That's a good way. Also psychological warfare. Who are we just talking to that
02:49:22.32 --> 02:49:30.88 OP? Yeah. Where? Okay. Basically, psychological warfare. What is that? It is in album with tracks,
02:49:32.08 --> 02:49:39.04 Juggle tracks, where in your campaign against weakness, meaning if you have goals. Like,
02:49:39.04 --> 02:49:47.28 okay, so I'll listen to Jordan Peterson. And he kind of, he has this thing. I'm not going to go
02:49:47.28 --> 02:49:50.88 it like too much into it. But he has this thing where he's like, okay, why don't why don't people
02:49:50.88 --> 02:49:55.28 get what they want? And so because in one of the reasons is because they just don't know what that is.
02:49:55.28 --> 02:49:58.88 And we kind of don't. Even if you say, I want to get better, better in what?
02:49:58.88 --> 02:50:02.56 Judging sir. Because you can do one push-up a day and you're technically better.
02:50:03.20 --> 02:50:08.000 Technically. So it's like, what do you mean better? Better how, whatever, so anyway,
02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:12.56 back to the psychological. If you want to, I don't know, lose weight. You know, wake up earlier and
02:50:12.56 --> 02:50:17.04 be more disciplined in these specific ways and all this stuff. You want to clean up your diet.
02:50:17.04 --> 02:50:20.16 To clean up your diet, you've got to avoid junk food, all this stuff. junk food, you need to
02:50:20.16 --> 02:50:26.80 get distracted by short-term payoffs, right? With junk food. Because junk, the whole idea of
02:50:26.80 --> 02:50:32.40 junk food is short-term payoffs over long-term payoffs. Good diet, long-term payoffs. Bad diet,
02:50:32.40 --> 02:50:39.60 short-term payoffs. Anyway, if you get tempted by weakness, you listen to the psychological
02:50:39.60 --> 02:50:44.08 warfare album or just a track of whatever. So look, you're waking up early in the morning,
02:50:44.08 --> 02:50:49.20 the 430 every day. That's what I'm doing from now on. That one day when you're kind of tired.
02:50:50.32 --> 02:50:57.36 And the alarm goes off and you're tempted or compelled to press the snooze or just stay in bed.
02:50:57.36 --> 02:51:03.44 I'll wake up later. Oh wake up at noon. Just saying something. Wake up at noon sometimes.
02:51:04.56 --> 02:51:09.76 Play this track called get up and get after it. I guarantee you won't wake up at noon. You'll
02:51:09.76 --> 02:51:18.24 wake up at the assigned time. Assign by yourself by the way. 100% success rate on that. If you fail,
02:51:18.24 --> 02:51:23.04 if you listen to this and you fail at your little thing, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to say.
02:51:23.68 --> 02:51:27.60 But that's a good one. Psychological warfare. Joccal will link. Look for it. Look into it.
02:51:28.40 --> 02:51:32.88 Also, you get some joccal white tea. You can get that on Amazon. It'll make you be able to
02:51:32.88 --> 02:51:39.84 do amazing feet to strengthen with no effort barely at all. Yeah, like the rock bag. Yeah,
02:51:39.84 --> 02:51:42.80 the yellow jocquite tea boom. You nailed it. Easy money. One hand.
02:51:44.72 --> 02:51:50.000 Books like echo said tough as they come by Travis Mills. You can get that. You can also
02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:55.52 get a book called Extreme Ownership that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin. It's about combat leadership.
02:51:55.52 --> 02:52:00.72 Way of the warrior kid. If you want your kid or a kid that you know to be stronger, smarter,
02:52:00.72 --> 02:52:08.16 healthier and therefore, because they're stronger, smarter and healthier, they're also more confident.
02:52:09.20 --> 02:52:13.20 If you want to do that for a kid, get them book called Way of the Warrior Kid.
02:52:15.68 --> 02:52:25.04 Then you can also get the discipline equals freedom field manual. It got a little bump the other
02:52:25.04 --> 02:52:28.88 day. I don't know. I think like in social media, I put something out and got a little bump
02:52:28.88 --> 02:52:34.64 and all of a sudden the delivery dates of people that just ordered it got pushed back. So I don't
02:52:34.64 --> 02:52:40.88 know, I don't know specifically like what that means, but I tell you this, it means you just order it
02:52:40.88 --> 02:52:45.28 now. If you want to get it when it comes out order it, if you want that first edition copy,
02:52:45.28 --> 02:52:51.92 which is pretty much what you want. If you need leadership in your world, which you probably do,
02:52:51.92 --> 02:52:58.16 because that's the way things get done is through leadership and you need help in that department.

02:54:02.16 --> 02:54:12.88 I am at Jocca-Willink and to all the military members out there that are holding the line.
02:54:12.88 --> 02:54:20.88 Thank you and to those veterans that stood the watch, especially those that were wounded.
02:54:23.20 --> 02:54:33.76 Thank you for giving us our freedom and to police law enforcement firefighters, EMTs and other
02:54:33.76 --> 02:54:42.32 first responders. Thank you for your service. And thank you for keeping us protected from man
02:54:42.32 --> 02:54:52.40 and from nature here at home. And to everyone else out there facing struggles and facing hard times.
02:54:54.32 --> 02:55:04.40 Remember, remember the challenges that Travis Mills faced and still faces.
02:55:04.40 --> 02:55:15.68 And he faces those incredible challenges every minute of every day. And he does that with
02:55:15.68 --> 02:55:30.08 tenacity and positivity and proves without question. That if you never quit and you never give up
02:55:30.08 --> 02:55:37.52 and you keep moving forward, then nothing can stop you from getting after it.
02:55:37.52 --> 02:55:48.64 So, until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
