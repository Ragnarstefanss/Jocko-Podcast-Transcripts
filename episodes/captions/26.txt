[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 26 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:11] O for a voice like thunder and a tongue to drown the throat of war.
[00:00:19] When the senses are shaken and the soul is driven to madness who can stand
[00:00:24] when the souls of the oppressed fight in the troubled air that rages who can stand.
[00:00:34] When the whirlwind of fury comes from the throne of God,
[00:00:39] when the frowns of his countenance drive the nations together who can stand.
[00:00:46] When sin claps his broad wings over the battle and sails rejoicing in the flood of death,
[00:00:57] when souls are torn to everlasting fire and feans of hell rejoice upon the slain.
[00:01:04] O who can stand. Good evening echo. Good evening.
[00:01:21] That right there is a little excerpt of a poem by a guy named William Blake.
[00:01:27] And it paints war as something so powerful, so evil, something superhuman.
[00:01:50] In the full poem is really a statement against a born-a-g, as it goes on and it's not that much
[00:01:56] longer but it blames war on the politicians and on the kings and on the nobles and it blames
[00:02:03] war on the religious leaders. But he asked that question over and over again who can stand.
[00:02:16] And I can actually answer that question.
[00:02:18] And I've seen who can stand. I've seen people break but I have seen many brave men and women
[00:02:29] on the battlefield stand. Stand against fear and death and stand against evil.
[00:02:38] Stand as sin claps his broad wings over the battle and sails rejoicing in the flood of death.
[00:02:55] And that's William Blake. Those are his words but he's writing that in the late 1700s and early 1800s.
[00:03:02] He had no idea how bad war would get. And I'm not saying war is worse in terms of individual
[00:03:15] horror but in terms of scale, it can't be denied. I mean world war one in world war two, the scale of
[00:03:22] horror, it would be incomprehensible to a man from Blake's time. He just couldn't understand it.
[00:03:38] So let's go to June 6, 1944.
[00:03:43] As the demon spread his wings over the beaches of Normandy and man stood against his evil.
[00:04:00] The English cocks and tried to drop the ramp a couple hundred feet from the shore when
[00:04:13] the sergeant ordered. Take us all the way in. Just then machine guns opened up and bullets
[00:04:20] tore through the wooden sides of the landing craft. Wounding four or five men, men began screaming,
[00:04:27] opened the damn doors. Just as the ramp went down there was a pause in the incoming fire.
[00:04:33] We exited fast diving into the water and holding on. Sergeant Tron was lying next to me when
[00:04:39] he was shot through the wrist. I crawled over to him and gave him first aid. We just let the
[00:04:44] tide wash over the lower portion of our bodies using our fingernails to pull forward, inch by inch
[00:04:51] to keep from drowning. I looked back at our assault craft and both English sailors were dead.
[00:04:58] They were heroes and paid the price for getting us in. They risked their safety to get us closer to
[00:05:05] shore. Private Thomas McCarter was the first fatality in our sector. His cries to me for help
[00:05:17] still haunt me. Waded down and possibly wounded. He frantically struggled in the water as he cried
[00:05:24] my name, but I couldn't get to him. It was drilled into us that we must push forward to the objective
[00:05:30] and to let the medics take care of the wounded. We were subjected to grazing fire from Chris
[00:05:37] costing fire from machine guns. I believed at the time that it would be better for me to push
[00:05:43] forward since Tom was quite far away. These machine guns kept firing until we got to the sea wall.
[00:05:53] Tom was my friend and I should have tried to save him.
[00:06:01] It took individual riflemen using grenades, satchel charges and bayonets to neutralize the
[00:06:07] almost impregnable concrete bunkers. I didn't see any rangers until later. In my opinion,
[00:06:14] the air force and navy made it possible for us to hang on until reinforcements and more equipment
[00:06:19] arrived. They also kept the Germans from mounting an armored counter attack.
[00:06:24] But you know, it boils down to the bloody foot soldier and his rifle to hold on to the real estate.
[00:06:39] That right there was private first class ran off a gentleman company d
[00:06:47] 116th infantry 27 years old, d 27 years old on d day, a mortar gunner.
[00:07:02] Now we're going to hear from private first class George A. Kobe company d 116th infantry.
[00:07:09] 600 yards from the shore, the English cox and lost his nerve and slowed the engine.
[00:07:19] This improved the Germans opportunity to hit our boat. Captain's shielding was looking
[00:07:23] through the vision slit. Look back at the sailor and said, you're not going to drop that ramp here.
[00:07:29] Technical sergeant Stinett was standing next to the captain.
[00:07:33] Suddenly an 88 millimeter hit the ramp directly, blowing captain's shielding blackward,
[00:07:38] killing him instantly. Part of the ramp caught Stinett's left eye knocking it out.
[00:07:47] With John Sefko, Vic Cremone and Eugene Adrian, we finally made it to the sea wall.
[00:07:55] How I'll never know. It was the worst fire I was ever subjected to in all of my combat.
[00:08:03] Now we've got private first class Robert L. sales company B 116th infantry.
[00:08:16] Join the Virginia National Guard at age 15.
[00:08:25] About 100 yards from the shore, the English cox and said he couldn't get us any closer.
[00:08:30] As the ramp lowered, enemy machine guns opened up, firing directly into our boat.
[00:08:38] Like all great leaders, Captain Zap was the first off the boat and the first one to get hit.
[00:08:46] Staff Sergeant Dick Wright was second and also hit falling into the water.
[00:08:53] A medic was third and I didn't see what happened to him. I was fourth.
[00:08:57] I caught my heel in the ramp and fell sideways out of the path of that MG 42 undoubtedly saving my life.
[00:09:06] All of the men that followed were either killed by Germans or drowned.
[00:09:11] No one from my craft was ever found alive.
[00:09:18] The captain screamed, I'm hit. I tried to get to him, but he was lost in the surf.
[00:09:23] Men were all around me in the water bleeding from wounds and screaming for help.
[00:09:30] I knew the boat was the target so I got away from it as fast as I could.
[00:09:35] One of the first things I did was shed my SCR 300 radio and my assault jacket.
[00:09:42] That radio was heavy and I suppose it's still at the bottom of the channel.
[00:09:45] Mortar and artillery shells were landing all around and one hit so close that it knocked me groggy.
[00:09:53] Luckily a log floated by with an unexploded teller mine still attached.
[00:09:59] I grabbed hold of it until my head cleared a bit.
[00:10:03] I remained behind that log pushing an informe me using it as a shield as I reached dry until I reached
[00:10:08] dry land. The first person I saw in the beach that I recognized was Dick Wright.
[00:10:14] He haulered over to me that he was badly hit. I watched him trying to raise his arms,
[00:10:21] but a sniper spotted him and shot him through the head. His face fell into the sand never to move again.
[00:10:30] I didn't try to go to him because I knew he was dead.
[00:10:35] While pinned down on that beach I watched incoming landing craft being shot at.
[00:10:40] One of them carried the battalion surgeon, Captain Robert B. Ware, a man I knew from my
[00:10:46] hometown of Madison Heights, Virginia. The doctor had flaming red hair. I watched him as he
[00:10:53] disembarked the landing craft and that machine gun opened up, cutting him down.
[00:10:59] When I will never forget, we're seeing his helmet fly off his head and showing all that red hair.
[00:11:04] I crawled on my belly using the dead and wounded as a shield.
[00:11:11] Sometime later I saw Max Smith from Shepherd Town, West Virginia.
[00:11:18] And some other B company men taking shelter behind a sea wall.
[00:11:22] Some of them were badly wounded. I banded Smith's eye that was lying out of his face.
[00:11:28] I kept crawling back to the water's edge dragging men out if they were still living.
[00:11:32] I didn't bother if they were dead. I pulled quite a few to safety.
[00:11:37] One of the medics helped to give first aid and comfort to the wounded.
[00:11:42] The first enemy soldier I saw was a prisoner.
[00:11:46] And terrorigators had him on his knees and his hands were locked behind his head.
[00:11:53] He didn't look so tough to me but those guys up on the cliffs were plenty tough.
[00:11:57] You can't imagine how helpless it was to be lying on that beach and those machine guns and sniper shooting anything that moved.
[00:12:06] At this point we were not sure the invasion would succeed.
[00:12:11] Our company was shot up so badly that there was no organization or communication from other sectors to tell us how they were doing.
[00:12:20] If all the landing zones were as helpless as we were, the invasion was in jeopardy.
[00:12:24] We felt helpless and alone.
[00:12:29] We had many acts of heroism from B company, men with many of them unreported.
[00:12:36] Lieutenant William B. Williams single-handedly with hand grenades and a rifle charged and subdued a pill box.
[00:12:45] Sergeant William Pears and Odeal Paget survived the landing better than we did and were able to take a few
[00:12:51] men up to those rocks and cliffs and fight it out with the Germans.
[00:12:55] It was touching go for quite some time in our sector.
[00:13:01] Not until St. Lofel and Jalide did we know for sure that the invasion was a success.
[00:13:07] D-Day was indeed the longest day but there were many many long days after that.
[00:13:14] Day after bloody day it was jumping over those hedgeros and men getting killed.
[00:13:18] We lost some very good men every single day. St. Lofel was about 25 miles from the beach and it was
[00:13:27] liberated on July 18th. When St. Lofel we felt confident that we were in France to stay,
[00:13:36] surviving the war was another story.
[00:13:39] So those were some excerpts right there from a book by John Robert Slotter.
[00:13:56] The book is called Omaha Beach and Beyond the Long March of Sergeant Bob Slotter.
[00:14:03] Those excerpts that I just read, they weren't Bob Slotter. They were various other people that
[00:14:07] worked with him that he went back and interviewed. This is another guy born in Tennessee,
[00:14:17] grew up in Rowan Oak, Virginia, enlisted in the Army Reserves at age 15.
[00:14:27] And as he's given an intro to the book here, this is what he says.
[00:14:34] I remember buddies with whom I spent passes to London.
[00:14:39] Men I played cards with a couple of days before the landing, who signed their autographs on my
[00:14:44] Eisenhower D. Day missive, who shook hands with me on the Javelins deck.
[00:14:51] Young man, young man, as I was, all killed during the largest air land and sea battle ever fought.
[00:14:59] Many more were maimed and never seen again. How could I forget this epic event even if I failed
[00:15:08] to recall the proper names and faces? Men wars are not history, but history is someone's recorded
[00:15:17] memory. Most of us remember noble and heroic deeds, but conveniently forget or fail to record
[00:15:28] the less than noble. I am no different. Many times I did and saw things that are best for gotten
[00:15:37] or left on written. War brings out the best and the worst in most of us. The Nazis were accused
[00:15:47] of killing, raping, pillaging, and burning. A few on our side were also guilty of these crimes.
[00:15:54] Soldiers on both sides looted for souvenirs as did I. And yet, cruel treatment of the enemy
[00:16:04] was an unusual occurrence. I myself am proud to say that I want saved an enemy soldier's life.
[00:16:14] This book will attempt to show that ordinary men and women can do extraordinary
[00:16:18] feats if they believe the cause is great. Many GIs have said that they were merely fighting for
[00:16:25] each other. True, but I maintain another factor played in a more important role, and it can be
[00:16:32] summed up with one word, pride. Regardless of their motives, I saw very few cowards in the
[00:16:42] 116th Infantry Regiment, made God bless the many, many more heroes.
[00:16:51] Yeah, this is one of those books where I don't have a lot to add in some of these situations.
[00:17:01] Now, Bob Slotter was his nickname Bob Slotter, and when he got to England, they actually took
[00:17:14] him and a bunch of other soldiers and they formed him into a new unit called the 29th Rangers.
[00:17:20] And they trained these guys ultra hard. They did all kinds of stuff for 11 months getting ready
[00:17:28] for the invasion. These 29th Rangers, they did marching in mountain climbing in a crazy obstacle course.
[00:17:36] They trained in unarmed combat. They did log PT, cold weather training. I mean, just grueling training.
[00:17:45] And at the end of all that harsh training for a number of reasons, they actually disbanded
[00:17:52] this group, and they sent them all back with their regular units. So they had a group of guys that
[00:17:58] got trained super hard, you know, like what we would consider a modern sort of special operation
[00:18:03] selection course. They went through that, but then when they got done with this training,
[00:18:09] and they were getting ready for the actual invasion, they took them dispersed them amongst the regular
[00:18:15] troops. And the guy that ran this training for the 29th Rangers was a guy named major mill
[00:18:25] Holland. And he sent a letter to his daughter, and this is what he wrote. And this is after these guys
[00:18:32] got disbanded. He said, every boy should be made to play football and box and participate in all
[00:18:40] kinds of athletics. And above all, the Americans should be taught discipline and decent living.
[00:18:49] Then he should be given a year of the toughest kind of military training, not the kind that we know,
[00:18:54] but the kind I gave my Rangers. God, I wish I had those boys now. We would tear the German
[00:19:01] stringy. I hear of those boys now and then, and although they are almost all gone now,
[00:19:09] they have done unbelievable things in our spoken of almost in a tone of reverence by officers and
[00:19:15] men alike who have fought with them, they were men trained and trained hard and learned about
[00:19:28] discipline. The parents out there get your kids training, sports, decent living.
[00:19:37] That's how you make men. Now, fast-forwarding, because they went back to their regular army units
[00:19:51] and they continued to train and prepared for the invasion. And Bob Slotters assigned to
[00:19:58] D Company, 116th Infantry Division. And I'm fast-forwarding right now, straight to D Day,
[00:20:09] straight to his perception of D Day and what it was like for him.
[00:20:19] You know, this is all that training that these guys have been through
[00:20:24] and none of them had been the car of that before. So this is it. Their first operation is D Day.
[00:20:38] And this is what it's like back to the book about 150 yards from the shore,
[00:20:45] despite the warning from someone behind me to keep your head down, I cautiously peeped up.
[00:20:50] I could see that craft that the craft about 25 yards to a right and a couple of hundred yards ahead
[00:20:56] were targeted by small arms. Firing, tracing, trace or bullets skipped off,
[00:21:02] skipped and bounced off the ramp and sides as they zeroed in before the ramps fell.
[00:21:08] I said to anyone close enough to hear above the bed them. Men, we are going to catch hell,
[00:21:14] be ready. Then it began to happen. Enemy artillery and mortar shells sent great
[00:21:22] plumes of water spouting skyward as they exploded in the water. Near Mrs. Rainedus with sea water,
[00:21:30] I suddenly became very worried about what Jerry would do to us.
[00:21:35] How in the hell did those sons of bitches survive what we thought was a carpet bombing and un-shelling
[00:21:42] of the beach? At Slapped in Sands, we trained with live explosions but these were far more frightening.
[00:21:51] This time they were shooting to kill every one of us.
[00:21:57] The craft slowed as we scraped a submerged sandbar which kept us from a dry landing.
[00:22:03] Everyone wanted to get the hell off that rocking boat but the cox and that trouble dropping the steel ramp.
[00:22:08] When it finally slammed and splashed down, the front of the boat began to buck like a wild
[00:22:13] stallion, raising six or seven feet, turning slightly sideways and then slamming down again.
[00:22:20] The first men went to exit off about mid-Ramp. The craft surged forward and crushed the
[00:22:26] fort-porfellow to death. So I jumped off and moved away from the crazy erratic landing craft.
[00:22:35] Luckily, I didn't see anyone else get hit by the ramp.
[00:22:40] I was now struggling in water up to my armpits,
[00:22:43] luckily for me at six foot five, most of the time my head was above water.
[00:22:48] Later as I crossed the beach, my height would be a detriment making me a larger target.
[00:22:54] Meanwhile, as I tried to get to shore, shorter men grabbed my clothing to keep their heads above water.
[00:23:00] Suddenly, as fear replaced seasickness, I was no longer cold.
[00:23:06] Most of all, I feared I would drown after being shot.
[00:23:09] Snipers hiding in the bluffs hit quite a few men, but most of the damage came from rapid firing
[00:23:16] automatic weapons. In every war since gunpowder was invented, soldiers have experienced the
[00:23:24] dreaded feeling of being under live enemy fire for the first time.
[00:23:28] It was demoralizing to hear good men scream as bullets ripped into soft flesh and others scream
[00:23:36] as the fierce flooding tide dragged the non-swimmers under.
[00:23:44] I remember helping private earnest, McCandless, who was struggling to get closer in.
[00:23:51] He still had one of the precious boxes of 30 caliber machine gun ammo.
[00:23:55] I remember him shouting to me, slaughter. Are we going to get through all of this?
[00:24:00] I didn't know how to answer him, so I didn't say anything. To tell the truth,
[00:24:06] I thought we were all going to die.
[00:24:11] A body with its life-perferred, preserved, inflated, floated by.
[00:24:15] The face had turned already turned a dark purple.
[00:24:19] At first, I thought it was private, Richard Gomez, who had a dark complexion.
[00:24:23] But I later found out that Gomez had survived the day.
[00:24:27] The fellow I saw was just one of thousands who died.
[00:24:31] There is no way to be sure if I had known him.
[00:24:34] Many of our company were hit in the water and drowned. Good swimmers are not.
[00:24:40] I came ashore, surrounded by the screams of men who had been hit and were drowning under their
[00:24:46] ponderous loads. All around me, dead men floated in the water, along with live men who acted as if they
[00:24:53] were dead. The Germans couldn't tell which was which. The flooding tide washed everyone in.
[00:25:03] Lying at the edge of the high watermark, I watched a GI trying to cross the beach.
[00:25:09] He had a hard time running. I believe he was from the craft to our right.
[00:25:12] An enemy gunner cut him down and he staggered and fell to the sand.
[00:25:18] I can still hear the screaming. A well-marked medical corpsman moved quickly to help him.
[00:25:24] He was also shot. I'll never forget seeing that medic lying next to that dying soldier,
[00:25:30] both screaming for help. Within minutes, as I watched, both men fell silent and mercifully
[00:25:39] died. I saw men vomit at the sickening sites and others cried openly and unashamedly.
[00:25:50] All of us had to find it within ourselves to get across that sandy no man's land.
[00:25:56] This is where the army's strict discipline and rigorous training took over.
[00:26:01] Individual pride had a lot to do with it too. What an unbelievable first combat experience for
[00:26:20] these guys. I want you to think about that image of you're in a boat. You're a couple hundred
[00:26:28] meters off shore, maybe two or three hundred meters off shore and you're looking two hundred meters ahead of
[00:26:33] you and you're starting to see tracers impact on this boat that you know your next.
[00:26:41] You know your next. There's no turning back. There's the only thing you can do. There's nothing's
[00:26:46] going to stop it. Did you saw Sabie in private right? Yes. Yes. So to me, they did a good job in capturing
[00:26:57] that moment where everyone's like it's like real tans and you can slowly start to hear the
[00:27:02] boom boom and the way it kind of builds and builds and how chaotic it gets man. It's like the most
[00:27:08] especially at that time is one of the most real feeling movies you know and having more that.
[00:27:16] They did an outstanding job and they did an outstanding job in that opening stage. It's just so crazy
[00:27:21] like to hear the real account right and then kind of compare it and you know when you watch the
[00:27:28] movie you're like dang that's crazy that's because you're kind of involved in the movie but when you
[00:27:33] think more and you're like dang this this really happened this is what really happened. Yeah and
[00:27:38] and also I mean obviously the actors do a good job of portraying what's going on in their minds
[00:27:45] but this is what was going on. Yeah this is what you was thinking. Yeah. Seeing they Steven Spielberg
[00:27:53] put those guys through these harsh conditions during that you know so they'd kind of
[00:27:58] some little Hollywood bootcare. Yeah but even while they're filming it you know to kind of help
[00:28:03] capture I mean obviously it's you can't compare it to the real deal. They did an outstanding job
[00:28:09] and the first time I saw that scene I was I was impacted. Yeah I was I was definitely impacted
[00:28:18] you know and I remember I wasn't with my guys in Ramadi they were honored not there were
[00:28:26] really hellacious situation and they were in a in a Bradley fighting vehicle and as they were
[00:28:36] going on to target they they were hearing rounds hit the outside of the Bradley as they were
[00:28:41] getting as the ramp was about to go down and actually I think I I can't remember this 100% but I'm
[00:28:48] pretty sure that the the young officer in that vehicle I remember him telling me I remember
[00:28:53] him telling me about he was like damn but he said he was screaming don't put the ramp down
[00:29:00] like just leave it up don't we're getting shot at and they're ready to come here so they just
[00:29:04] put the ramp down anyways so they didn't what he did you just go yeah yeah so back to the book
[00:29:17] after I fired my M1 it jammed to clean it I slipped out of my assault jacket and spread my
[00:29:24] raincoat only to discover bullet holes in my pack and coat suddenly overwhelmed with fear I
[00:29:32] became weak in the knees my hands shook as I tried to wipe sand from my weapon I had to catch my
[00:29:40] breath and compose myself by mid morning we had worked out worked our way to the base of the hill
[00:29:52] men from other units began to gather the regimental commander Colonel Charles DWCanim appeared
[00:30:00] from down beach with his right arm in a sling and clutch clutching a coat 45 semi-automatic
[00:30:06] pistol in his bony left hand can't him didn't look like a soldier but his sir's hell was one
[00:30:14] he was tall and thin were wire rimmed glasses and had a pencil thin mustache he yelled for the
[00:30:20] officers and noncombs to help him get the men across the beach and up the hill get these men
[00:30:28] the hell off this god damn beach and go kill some god damn crowds in a nearby pill box a
[00:30:35] young a lieutenant Colonel taking refuge from the enemy mortar barrage yelled out to cannon Colonel
[00:30:41] you better take cover you're gonna get killed Colonel canom screamed his reply get your ass out of there
[00:30:48] and help me get these men off this beach the officer did what cannon ordered
[00:30:54] so now we got somebody leading serious leader and in the book slaughter put the memorandum
[00:31:10] from canom that canom wrote to the troops prior to D day so I'm gonna read that 29 May
[00:31:19] 1944 memorandum two the members of CT 116 reinforced to be read by commanders to all personnel
[00:31:30] prior to embarkation one the long awaited day is near and prior to embarkation I want to wish
[00:31:39] each of you the best of luck in your forthcoming adventure there's one certain way to get the
[00:31:46] enemy out of action and that is to kill him war is not child's play and requires hatred for the
[00:31:53] enemy at this time we don't have it I hope you get it when you see your friends wounded and killed
[00:32:04] two learn to take care of yourself from the start remember the hunt is a crafty intelligent
[00:32:10] fighter and will not have mercy on you don't have it on him he will try to outwit you
[00:32:19] beyond the alert three fighting awards the same as any athletic event only wars for keeps
[00:32:29] it is you or the enemy teamwork is the essence of success we have the tools the best in the
[00:32:36] world and is up to you to see that they are used properly four remember when you run into the
[00:32:45] enemy contain him with the minimum to stop him then move around him and strike him in the flank
[00:32:50] or the rear in all your contacts with him be ruthless always drive hard the hunt doesn't like
[00:32:59] Yankee drive and guts show him that you have plenty if you close with him use your bayonet
[00:33:08] show him you can take it and dish it out don't be caught napping don't let your Yankee curiosity
[00:33:14] get you blown up by a booby trap or a mine five take care of your arms and equipment
[00:33:22] conserve your ammunition make every shot count keep your weapons clean and oiled their proper
[00:33:31] functioning at the right time may mean your life every soldier must realize the importance of
[00:33:38] supply discipline and see that he himself does his part in conserving supplies more than one battle
[00:33:44] has been lost because munitions and other supplies were not available six do not eat your
[00:33:52] K and D rations prior to D day D plus one day you won't get anymore until D plus two
[00:34:02] seven the Navy and air will give us plenty of support general Montgomery was very optimistic
[00:34:08] and is talked to the officers yesterday at this dip at this time no one knows how much resistance
[00:34:14] we will meet on D day we may be able to walk in without trouble we may have to fight for your life
[00:34:20] to meet the worst and make up your minds now that you're going forward regardless and it is a one way
[00:34:29] ticket we are not giving any ground at any time and we are not leaving until the job is done
[00:34:41] to each one of you happy landings and come off those craft fight like hell
[00:34:46] can't um
[00:34:57] lays it out definitely lays it out I think those guys
[00:35:08] I think those guys couldn't have heard any better information
[00:35:12] keep clean keep discipline be ready flank the enemy always hear that flank the enemy
[00:35:27] so now these guys are in kind of an in a holding position they've they've kind of secured
[00:35:34] some chunks of the beach and it's a little bit of the high ground and now going back to the book
[00:35:39] we began to think about defending against the expected counter attack that we were told would take
[00:35:44] place in less than 24 hours to bolster our defenses we took turns making special trips back to the
[00:35:50] still dangerous beach in order to find more automatic weapons ammo and supplies
[00:35:57] when it was my turn to go down I was horrified at what I saw
[00:36:02] the debris strewn beach was a disaster area the incoming flooding tide brought with it the
[00:36:09] bodies of hundreds of our proud regimen scores of our men with bloodstained shirts rolled in the
[00:36:15] serve among helmets assault jackets gas masks and M1 rifles at the edge of the water I saw
[00:36:24] burning landing craft that had been trying to deposit a Sherman tank down its ramp the tank was
[00:36:32] also burning in abandoned from our perspective the battle looked hopeless you know that's something
[00:36:41] that he said that a couple times he didn't think they were going to win you know despite what
[00:36:48] can't say they were not going to give up any ground we're guess what I don't know if we're going to
[00:36:52] be able to hold this ground we might all die here and yet all these men pressed on here's a little
[00:37:04] here's a little look at the German attitude right here I saw regimental intelligence officer
[00:37:11] armed with a carbine interrogating a German prisoner the prisoner was on his knees with his hands
[00:37:17] behind his head he was rather small and frail looking I was surprised to see he was not wearing the
[00:37:23] usual square shaped battle helmet instead he wore a gray build cap the lieutenant asked the prisoner
[00:37:31] among other things where the mine fields were the soldier answered only with the accepted Geneva
[00:37:38] convention requirement of name rank and serial number we had been instructed not to take prisoners
[00:37:44] for the first two or three days so I expected the officer to eventually shoot the prisoner again the
[00:37:51] interrogator screamed where are the damn mine fields again he received the same reply name rank
[00:38:00] and serial number the lieutenant's carbine barked but the bullet was aimed at the ground between the
[00:38:07] prisoners knees the arrogant German looks straight at the officer and said with a smirk nicked here
[00:38:16] not here he pointed between his knees here he pointed to his head this told me something about our
[00:38:26] adversary so you had I mean you we we we we know that people will fight to the death we know that
[00:38:40] they get brainwashed him when you look at any history this this sounds like a young kid probably
[00:38:46] raised from the young very young age as a Nazi as a loyal Nazi just like the Japanese that fall to
[00:38:54] the death that's what we have here in many cases back to the book combat deaths are ugly and
[00:39:05] sickening a bullet or piece of red hot shrapnel tears flesh gristle and bone into gruesome wounds
[00:39:16] a few hours in the sun causes a body to swell grotesquely and turn dark purple
[00:39:21] the stench is unbearable such deaths were tragic insults to all those handsome young geys just
[00:39:30] beginning their lives who would not fulfill their dreams many of those killed were like me
[00:39:38] barely teenagers when they enlisted just starting to grow to maturity in the army
[00:39:43] those comrades and I spent many happy weekends and furloughs together soaking up culture and drinking
[00:39:51] bidders shared living quarters ready each other's mail and more significantly
[00:39:58] shared the misery of training in the most extreme developments
[00:40:04] the hundred and sixteenth infantry lost from 800 to 1000 men on D. Day and D. Company lost at least
[00:40:12] 72 of the dead 20 of them were from my hometown of Roanoke five of nine of our officers were killed
[00:40:24] including capital wall curshilling lieutenant William Gardner lieutenant Merrill Cummings
[00:40:31] lieutenant Vincent Lobowitz and lieutenant Alton Ashley there were 12 noncombs killed
[00:40:39] including these rowanokers sergeant James Obenchane staff sergeant James L. Wright sergeant
[00:40:50] Russell Jack Ingram and sergeant George D. Johnson Corporal Jack Sims
[00:40:56] add to the list of the dead 23 privates and another 32 wounded many of them severely
[00:41:13] and yet our nightmare had just begun brutal
[00:41:19] absolutely brutal and I wanted to rattle off those names of all those people from the hometown
[00:41:31] when we see a soldier or a marine or a sailor get killed now you see what it does to a town
[00:41:40] you see out of impacts a town imagine 20 from one little home town
[00:41:53] they moved past the initial D. Day and now they start to head to St. Low and this is where you
[00:42:02] 've heard about before if you know anything about history you know anything about this part of the
[00:42:06] war this is when they get into head drill country and they're fighting from head drill to
[00:42:11] head drill these head drills are you know these ancient I guess they're not structures
[00:42:17] their hedges but they're completely difficult to get through you have to cut through them
[00:42:22] a drive-thru and what tanks or whatever and they hold up and every one of these head drills
[00:42:26] becomes like a mini battle and their brutal battles back to the book the site of another
[00:42:34] terrible death that occurred at this time haunts my dreams to this day my squadron I
[00:42:40] were digging a machine gun in place may be behind a scrubby head drill we had just finished fixing
[00:42:45] the camouflage when it happens to you junior officer with field glasses scanning the front
[00:42:50] I could tell he was a newly arrived replacement his uniform and equipment were relatively new
[00:42:56] and unworn the sharp report of an 88 millimeter fired from some somewhere nearby
[00:43:04] and sent me diving at the same time the high explosive missile hit the lieutenant's upper torso
[00:43:12] the second squadron I were splattered with gore as the spotter was blown backward minus his head
[00:43:20] number two gunner private first class sal artery vomited and I nearly did too
[00:43:27] the dreaded German sniper was almost as highly respected as the 88 sharpers shooters gave no warning
[00:43:37] taking careful aim with sniper scoped mousers the receiving end would hear the sharp crack
[00:43:44] and instantaneous wind of the bullet if you heard the report of the bullet leaving the muzzle it
[00:43:50] wasn't for you German snipers nearly always aimed for the head if it was visible and in
[00:43:57] range most infantry men never removed their helmets except when they shaved and I confess that I
[00:44:04] slept in mind the 8 millimeter bullet could easily pass through the helmet through the head
[00:44:10] and out the other side with enough energy left to do more damage I saw men get hit between the eyes
[00:44:17] or just above the years which killed them instantly if the bullet missed the helmet the entry
[00:44:23] hole was usually neat and showed only a small trickle of blood but after the steel jacket bullet
[00:44:30] hit the helmet or the skull the bullet flattened causing the wound to shatter the other side of the
[00:44:37] head away
[00:44:39] this start receiving more fire he jumps for cover and then back to the book I climbed back
[00:44:57] on the path shaking but unscathed within minutes I had another surprise as I approached
[00:45:03] an opening on the right side of the head draw I heard someone moaning crawling carefully
[00:45:07] through the opening I came face to face with a young German paratrooper who had been hit by a large
[00:45:12] chunk of shrapnel he had a very serious upper thigh wound and his left trouser leg was bloody and torn
[00:45:21] this was my first encounter with the enemy up close the German paratrooper is a fierce and
[00:45:27] fanatical warrior easily distinguishable by his round helmet and baggy smock my first reaction was to
[00:45:34] put him out of his misery and keep going I believe he knew what I was thinking he begged
[00:45:42] dearfully comrade bitta to means friend please he was an impressive looking young soldier about
[00:45:49] 19 years old my age he was as filthy as I was with long brown stringy hair I'd always thought
[00:46:00] most German soldiers had short blonde hair he had an athletic build about five feet 10 inches tall
[00:46:08] about 180 pounds and a handsome face I suspended the promise I had made at the beach about not
[00:46:15] taking any prisoners I thought this that was then and this is now I just couldn't shoot a wounded
[00:46:25] human being at point blank range I made sure he didn't have a weapon hidden on him then I tied his
[00:46:31] belt around his upper thigh which stopped the blood from gushing I gently swabbed the dirt from
[00:46:37] his wound and applied sulfur powder his winds turned to a forest grin he was in pain so I gave
[00:46:46] machata morphine and a drink of water from my canteen then I let him have one of my lucky strikes
[00:46:53] cigarettes and lit it for him as I left he smiled weekly and said in gutterl broken English
[00:47:00] donka god bless good luck that changed my thinking about taking prisoners I still hated the
[00:47:08] enemy but I couldn't kill one at close at range especially if his hands were up I sent one of
[00:47:16] our medics to finish what I had started I hope the German would recover and that is war was over
[00:47:29] that's compassionate human being right there yeah does it kind of in a way put into perspective
[00:47:36] but more shed the light shed light on potentially the overall attitude where you're fighting a
[00:47:45] war and the enemy is more this entity of an enemy you know it's not like how many kicked this
[00:47:52] guy's I'm sure it's like it's not personal yeah yes and the US and the military we still do this
[00:47:58] they're gonna dehumanize the enemy as much as they can to make it easier for you to kill them yes
[00:48:04] that's why you call them crowds that's why you call them dinks that's why you call whatever the
[00:48:09] slang you know what would now be all be considered racial terms or politically incorrect terms
[00:48:16] there's a reason they're trying to dehumanize these other people they're trying to dehumanize
[00:48:22] the enemy so that you can more easily kill them and when you come face to face with them all
[00:48:28] the sudden they become human yeah isn't that crazy though like this whole crazy thing hold this
[00:48:34] probably the crazy thing imaginable for this guy he comes face to face with a guy that that
[00:48:42] you know kind of in between the bullets so to speak and he's face to face with this person and
[00:48:47] then really what the whole experience was reduced to in that moment is this one person helping
[00:48:53] another person you know and then even and it impacted both of them obviously you know where the
[00:48:59] guy was like hey god bless almost like came in we're in this war I dig it almost like a football
[00:49:03] gamer something like amen I dig it you know we're on this back different teams a good luck he told
[00:49:08] him good luck in a war man it's a man that that whole human factor when when you're exposed to it
[00:49:16] even with the enemy tank like that's gotta be strong huh yeah definitely definitely can be
[00:49:23] I mean in in World War one I mean there was times where then this is really famous there was
[00:49:27] times where they got out of the trenches and played soccer on Christmas day against each other
[00:49:31] and then the next day go back to slaughter each other crazy that must feel in in this weird way that
[00:49:38] must feel so good you know to be like like you know like you ever gotten like when you're a kid
[00:49:45] or even as an adult when you get you know like a argument with someone real bad maybe your friend
[00:49:50] or or not whatever you get a real bad argument with them and I don't know it lasted there too
[00:49:55] or we got to know whatever it's real bad and at the end you guys make up and you guys are like
[00:50:01] back friends again it's almost like it's such a good feeling maybe because of the contrast or
[00:50:06] I don't know maybe because I don't know but it's like it has to have like that kind of feeling
[00:50:11] when you're in this crazy war you're like I hate this so much hatred and just aggression and
[00:50:17] opposite you gotta remember this is there's plenty of guys and there's plenty of Germans I got
[00:50:21] smoked right there without a second yeah yeah and he just had that moment and maybe if that guy
[00:50:27] would have looked a little bit different or acted a little bit different or something happened more
[00:50:30] quicker like faster or something you know it just slowed down just for that second and and
[00:50:36] sucked them right there and it's like a both right hand what happened later the next people that
[00:50:40] came out the medic might have gone over and said wait you sent me over here to work on a German
[00:50:45] yeah that could have happened to you just never know
[00:50:48] thank now we're gonna start getting crushed with some artillery
[00:51:00] back to the book Jerry pounded the 116th all day and two nights with blockbuster 155
[00:51:08] millimeter and 105 millimeter artillery near misses caused enough concussion to make our ears ring
[00:51:15] and our heads ache the pounding rounds of salvo after salvo of earthshaking artillery
[00:51:22] will relentless and frightening during the bombardment I shared a long shallow slit
[00:51:28] trance with one of my first decompany replacements private Lewis Cass from Chevy Chase Maryland
[00:51:35] we nicknamed him junior early on because of his boyish looks and demeanor junior was from an
[00:51:40] affluent family and had volunteered into the army upon graduation from high school he didn't
[00:51:46] look like the type that could last very long in brutal combat our slit trunch was covered with wooden
[00:51:54] sheathing atop through the roof of piled dirt like thousands of other infantry soldiers
[00:52:00] subjected to such heavy bombardment junior and I wore a pitiful sight find yellow dust sifted
[00:52:07] through the cracks and the roof and stuck to our sweaty skin and eyes if the dust it had been
[00:52:14] black we would have looked like very tired coal miners the yellow dust turned a mud around our
[00:52:21] swollen bloodshot eyes when nature called we had to answer in the safety of our slit trunch lying down
[00:52:29] all the training and experience in the world could not have prepared us for this kind of harassment
[00:52:35] those box our boxed car side shells sounded like they were flip flopping and over and
[00:52:42] and screeching straight for our whole this went on hour after hour all day and through the night
[00:52:51] many good soldiers cracked and who could blame them
[00:52:58] the long bouts of duty had been taking their toll it was extremely rare for an infantry
[00:53:04] men to go unscathed for very long many twenty-niners were wounded two three or four times fighting
[00:53:13] through the hedgeros of Normandy all of us were praying for the million dollar wound
[00:53:20] which missed vital organs bone and nerves but would give us a long stay in an English hospital
[00:53:26] sleeping under clean white sheets and at least in fantasy in the care of a beautiful nurse
[00:53:32] meanwhile battle fatigue and self-inflicted wounds had become serious problems at least once nearly
[00:53:42] all combat soldiers if they are honest consider shooting themselves in order to get out of the
[00:53:47] hell of battle self-inflicted wounds however are considered disgraceful and if proven in
[00:53:55] a court martial offense nevertheless many respectable kia and wounded in action were in reality
[00:54:04] self-inflicted or friendly fire accidents so we have some massive stress
[00:54:16] stress that's driving men to shoot themselves yeah another mention of the million dollar wound yes
[00:54:23] you know like the ticket out you know and he's saying at least once nearly all combat soldiers
[00:54:30] if they are honest consider shooting themselves in order to get out of the hell of battle
[00:54:39] back to the book land mines and booby traps were also common ways to be wounded or killed
[00:54:46] hearing the news of who had gotten hit was always hard and every day new faces replaced
[00:54:50] seasoned infantry men it was easy to distinguish a new arrival from a veteran the old
[00:54:58] timer could be 18 or 19 years old but if he had survived a week on the front he was considered old
[00:55:06] and we all looked it on a diet of k-rashions we all lost weight our ribs shoulder blades
[00:55:15] and atoms apples stuck out and our filthy ragged uniforms hung like worn out drapes
[00:55:23] our eyes were blood red and sunken and we had bleeding swords on our exposed skin
[00:55:29] ordinarily ordinarily these would be telltale signs that a man needs a month's rest
[00:55:36] but we all knew there would be no rest until Saint low was taken
[00:55:40] knowing that there was no immediate end in sight drove some fellas over the edge
[00:55:50] a few good soldiers who couldn't take the pounding day after day
[00:55:55] committed suicide
[00:55:59] this was the case of Stanley Corsiac a 19-year-old private born and raised in Chicago
[00:56:06] he was a tough athletic little soldier he made the day landings and had fought well through the
[00:56:12] hedgeros but everyone has a breaking point his squad reported that Stan who had seen many of his
[00:56:21] close friends killed or severely wounded had begun to act strangely strangely he cried often
[00:56:28] especially during incoming artillery barrages and sometimes his crying reached the point of his
[00:56:34] stereo instead of the usual disciplinary action for similar behavior he was sent back to the kitchen
[00:56:42] area for a break from the action many of us thought that a few days rest a couple of hot meals
[00:56:49] and a warm bath might rehabilitate him but he was in more pain than any of us had realized
[00:56:57] why couldn't we see that he had reached his limit? Private Corsiac found a cooks springfield
[00:57:07] O3 rifle removed his shoe so he could pull the trigger and blew the top of his head off
[00:57:17] one of the cooks heard the shot and ran to his tent
[00:57:20] Stanley Corsiac had had enough of the constant fear the filthy grime the ears chattering
[00:57:27] explosions the putrid smells the extrusion pain and the maiming and deaths of his close friends
[00:57:36] Stan Corsiac died on July 2nd
[00:57:39] the record book shows he was killed a non-battle casualty in my book Private Corsiac died
[00:57:53] and American hero so we got to know that this demon that we're dealing with now
[00:58:02] has been around for a long time and you know that's a classic situation where his death
[00:58:15] Stan Corsiac's death is reported as a non-battle casualty which means no one labeled him a
[00:58:22] suicide which means how many people did that happen to and it was never captured they
[00:58:32] wasn't reported and so now we never dealt with it
[00:58:40] that if you don't deal with things you don't capture the lessons learned if you don't recognize
[00:58:44] these things how you get a fixum as Bob Slotter pointed out it was almost impossible for one of these
[00:58:53] guys to go day after day after day and not get wounded and he ended up getting wounded
[00:58:59] got trapped in a fragment of the bag gets pulled off the battlefield luckily
[00:59:10] and sent to an English hospital and here's what he says about that it is one thing to visit
[00:59:21] a wartime army hospital but something quite different and much worse to be a patient in one.
[00:59:31] Lawmakers will consider armed conflicts more carefully before rattling the proverbial savor if they
[00:59:36] were forced to visit an amputee abdominal burn or plastic surgery ward.
[00:59:42] Here that lawmakers before you send the boys off to war you need to go and spend some time in a
[00:59:54] hospital with wounded vets and make damn sure your decision that you're making.
[01:00:02] Back to the book I recovered in a ward dedicated to abdominal wound abdominal wound patients
[01:00:14] a bullet or a piece of metal shrapnel puncturing the stomach can cause a lifetime of embarrassment
[01:00:19] and misery. The aftermath of a gut wound is either death or eternal marriage to a
[01:00:27] colostomy sack the stench in that ward was predictable it was tough to share quarters with
[01:00:35] seriously wounded patients at night the morning and groaning and sometimes screaming made it hard to
[01:00:43] sleep many of the men there died. I remember one particularly sad boss swar the tony from Brooklyn
[01:00:55] was the third floor clown the shift nurse is fell in love with him because he kept the
[01:01:01] ward laughing with his teasing and practical jokes but one night his cherished laughter came to an
[01:01:07] awful end on a Saturday night with a skeleton crew on duty to only begin to be complained of a
[01:01:14] sharp pain to the gut. The floor nurse was paged and after several tries she arrived
[01:01:21] by that time tony was screaming as two orderlies quickly wheeled them into the emergency room.
[01:01:29] Two hours later tony was dead of gang green poisoning. Facial district facial disfigurement
[01:01:40] was terrible and more devastating to the patient than any other kind of wound. A few men had lost
[01:01:47] arms or legs either partly or completely and as a result some of them became so called basket
[01:01:54] cases even so and it sad to say some severely maimed men were actually happy about their condition
[01:02:03] because they were going home their combat days were over. So the war ends and actually Bob
[01:02:16] slaughtered does go back he recovers from his wounds he goes back he's there for the
[01:02:22] allied victory and that's another just fantastic story of how that all happens.
[01:02:33] And then he was out of the out of the army
[01:02:37] and this is what that feels like back to the book. On July 13th 1945 I was suddenly separated
[01:02:48] from the service discharged at Fort Mead Maryland with a few dollars in my pocket and the
[01:02:53] Kackie uniform on my back. I was suffering mental as well as physical wounds but there was no
[01:03:00] one to counsel me. I was a civilian again but I was not comfortable socializing with other
[01:03:07] civilians. I was 20 years old with an 11th grade education and no skills other than soldering.
[01:03:17] I was left alone to find my way home to Rono, Virginia. There was no treatment for post-traumatic
[01:03:26] stress syndrome. It was simply called battle fatigue. Those of us who had returned from the war
[01:03:33] were left to tough it out. The years rolled by our hair grade and thinned,
[01:03:43] waistlines grew and many of our company associates developed health problems. Our generation
[01:03:50] smoked cigarettes and drank hard liquor. Many of our men who had high halfway around the world
[01:03:56] became sedentary. We didn't like to exercise. We traveled to the beach and went to swimming pools
[01:04:02] thinking that sunshine was good for the skin. Many were disabled by wounds. Drank and smoke too
[01:04:09] much and died prematurely. The war still took its toll long after it was over.
[01:04:16] Rarely did anyone talk about the war. The media or silent are children uninterested
[01:04:28] and we ourselves sought to forget.
[01:04:31] I got married, raised two sons and went to work for a mid-sized newspaper in a mid-sized community.
[01:04:51] I found time to acquire a modicum of education, coach little league baseball,
[01:04:56] and was grateful to live a normal American life. Two many of my army buddies failed to reach
[01:05:06] their 25th birthday and many of those who did were never the same. After what they'd been through,
[01:05:15] they just couldn't adjust to the real world. Many of them fell prey to alcohol,
[01:05:21] loose women, radical religion, or isolation. Anything to help them get through each day,
[01:05:27] month and year. Seven of our D company men committed suicide.
[01:05:37] Compared to those and thousands more, I have been blessed.
[01:05:42] In some ways, writing this book, a process that has taken me almost 15 years has been the last
[01:05:49] leg of the journey. I realize that I speak for many who never had the chance to speak for themselves
[01:05:58] and I've done my best to pay them tribute. My hope is that this memoir,
[01:06:06] and however small a way will perpetuate their memory and stand as a witness to their sacrifices.
[01:06:12] It's saddens and worries me that so much of the world, including America itself, refuses to
[01:06:22] learn the hard lessons of the past. Now that I'm in my 80s, I am well aware that the long
[01:06:30] march that begins so many years ago is about to come to a halt. I am proud to say that my
[01:06:39] generation helped save the world from tyranny, prevent the extinction of an entire group of people
[01:06:45] and preserve the democratic freedoms of our wonderful American way of life.
[01:06:49] I wouldn't change a thing except to wish that my dear army buddies could be here too.
[01:07:04] And John Robert Bob Slotter died on May 29, 2012, and William Blake, the poet,
[01:07:28] you asked who can stand and I will tell you it is men like Bob Slotter that stand.
[01:07:43] And it's men like him that encourage me, and tell me in no uncertain terms that we are
[01:07:53] capable of more. We can do more, we can be more. We can stand.
[01:08:15] Not much to say after that one echo. No sir. Not much to say.
[01:08:20] Yeah, obviously I can't help but agree fully. A lot of these, we go through these books.
[01:08:31] It's crazy how much it puts into perspective. Everyone knows about World War II.
[01:08:38] Everyone knows, most people we know about World War II. We know about the wars, but that's
[01:08:44] we don't really know about the wars. We don't know about the details that we don't know about
[01:08:49] individual experiences, which really is that's what makes the wars. Yes. And we don't know anything about that.
[01:08:57] And what's interesting, this book was recommended to me from Twitter, from one of the troopers out there.
[01:09:04] And so we have the band of brothers, right? And everybody knows band of brothers, I'm not everybody,
[01:09:08] but most people, more people know band of brothers. Because it was a book and then it was a big
[01:09:14] HBO movie and it was awesome. This book is less well known. But what you have to know is that there's
[01:09:26] thousands and thousands of stories that we don't know and we will never know. I mean, some of
[01:09:33] we will try to know, but there's so many stories that we will never know. That moment in combat,
[01:09:40] when this guy tried to save that guy and they both did something completely heroic and they both
[01:09:46] died and we never will know. So we have to cherish what we can find out, what we can learn.
[01:09:57] But there's just so much there and so much sacrifice that was made. And as I always say,
[01:10:06] what are we doing right now to honor that sacrifice? More, that's what we need to do, more.
[01:10:27] And with that, let's make a, let's make the hard transition once again to the,
[01:10:35] the rough transition to the interweb for some questions.
[01:10:41] Speaking of interwebs on it.com slash jockel is where you can get 10% off of the spectacular supplements.
[01:10:52] Namely, real oil and shrimp tech. What about alpha briny? That's good that you remember that you
[01:11:02] must have been on alpha briny. And also you might want to just do yourself that favor and get some of
[01:11:08] those words. What else? What else? If you're in the mood to support this podcast before you shop

[01:11:53] your Amazon shopping and you can support that way or get a shirt or a coffee mug or a bumper sticker
[01:12:02] from jockelstore.com. And we weren't keeping it a secret or nothing but we do have a new shirt out.
[01:12:09] Oh, we do. Know the darkness. To appreciate. You know the saying, well, I know that this podcast can
[01:12:18] get a little bit dark from time to time. Yeah, because you know how like you're a regional, um,
[01:12:23] one of your regional things was, you know, you go through life and certain people all they see is
[01:12:27] is the good thing so they get kind of desensitized to like the just small little good things in life.
[01:12:35] You know, someone you when you and that's really everything anyway where, you know, when you
[01:12:39] there's no tall people if everyone's the same size. So you kind of got to know both, you know,
[01:12:45] the both short and tall. No, I've said it many times and I think there originally, I think I originally
[01:12:52] said it on the Tim Ferrissio. He said he said something along lines of like, hey,
[01:12:58] jockel, I've struggled with depression. How close should you get to the darkness? Right, right.
[01:13:05] Because I was talking about some dark things and I said well, Tim,
[01:13:08] um, if you really want to know the light, then you got to know the darkness. Right. So echo made a
[01:13:16] t-shirt about the darkness. Yeah, just as know that. And here's the thing, I kind of added another
[01:13:20] dimension to it. It's it's all black. It's black on black. So you see, you can't, you know, it's all dark.
[01:13:27] You can kind of see it. Anyway, it's cool. New shirt. New shirt up. If you want that one.
[01:13:33] Um, yep. There it is. Let's get to some questions from the interwebs. First question.
[01:13:42] Jockel, what is your relationship to surfing? Could you surf on active duty and what is surfing
[01:13:50] do for you? Okay, so my relationship with surfing. Number one, I was lucky to have a guy that
[01:14:00] when I was a kid up in Maine. That said, hey, I'm going to teach you how to surf. This guy was a
[01:14:06] lifeguard. He was an outstanding surfer. And he said, I'm going to teach you how to surf. And I was
[01:14:10] a 10 year old kid. Nice. What? In the freezing cold water. And I said, yeah, awesome. Then so he gave
[01:14:17] me an old surf board and put me out there and taught me how to surf when I was 10 years old. And it
[01:14:21] definitely, you know, surfing up in Maine is a little bit different because it's dark and it's cold.
[01:14:27] And you got to do a little bit of suffering if you want to enjoy the benefits of it. You got to know
[01:14:33] the darkness. I don't know. I said anything about the darkness. So surfing. Yeah, quite. Yeah,
[01:14:38] coi, you didn't have to deal with that. So that's how I got it surfing and surfing a lot of people
[01:14:43] will tell you when you do it. It's it's somewhat addictive because it's a very, a very, you know,
[01:14:51] kind of paradoxical thing because it's very relaxing at the same time. It's very kind of exciting.
[01:14:56] I guess is the word you get a little adrenaline, but you get a little melodout to. So it's a very
[01:15:00] fun thing to do. Good for you. It's good for your brain. It's good for the soul. And when I was on
[01:15:08] activity, if you're on active duty in the sales teams, yeah, you can surf. And I definitely surf.
[01:15:14] Sometimes more, more, I was more focused on surfing than others. When I really went B. J. J. Crazy,
[01:15:23] I wasn't doing anything else with any free time other than J. J. So that's, but yeah,
[01:15:30] there's guys. There's guys in the sealed teams that that actually manipulate their career
[01:15:35] around surfing because you can get station and you can go on trips to great surf spots.
[01:15:39] And all that and there's some, there's some pretty amazing surfers in the sealed
[01:15:44] teams in the military as well. But I mean, I only know about guys in sealed them. There's a
[01:15:47] good guy named Ivan Trent, whose dad was Busy trying to fame this old pioneer surfer in Hawaii.
[01:15:55] And Ivan Trent, what I was a picture when I first got in the sealed teams, there was a picture of
[01:15:59] Ivan Trent dropping in on a giant wave that would me obey the famous one via Bay. So there's some great
[01:16:05] surfers. It's definitely a little subculture inside the teams and you could definitely,
[01:16:10] you can definitely surf a lot. I mean, you're living in San Diego or Virginia Beach. I mean,
[01:16:15] Virginia Beach has waves sometimes. San Diego has waves a lot of the times.
[01:16:21] And what does it do for me? Well, one thing is it gets to get you outside. It gets me outside
[01:16:28] and gets you out into nature. And what I like about nature,
[01:16:34] nature, what I like about nature is nature makes you feel small. That's what nature, to me,
[01:16:40] that's what's good about nature. That's what, that's why nature puts things in perspective
[01:16:44] because nature makes you feel small. Make you realize, you know what, look at the ocean. I'm nothing.
[01:16:50] Look at the giant wilderness, I'm in, I'm nothing. So it just keeps you in check and keeps you
[01:16:55] in perspective. That's one of the, that's actually one of the things that the, probably the only
[01:16:59] thing I don't like about your jet to is pretty much the most part. It's inside. It's inside the gym on the
[01:17:06] mat. And so, you know, you can do it outside, but it's hard to do outside. This is the Matt's
[01:17:13] get super hot. It's just not, it's just a thousand times more efficient and convenient to do
[01:17:20] inside. It's novel outside. It's novel, exactly. It's cool to do sometimes. And at my old house,
[01:17:27] I had like a full outdoor jujitsu area, which was cool. And I had a shade structure over it. It was good.
[01:17:32] It was good. But you have to have something to that extent before it's not like you can just
[01:17:37] do jujitsu outside and you can do it. It's, but it's novel. And you know how to, you know,
[01:17:42] what, if you do an in grass, you get the grass edges. Yeah. For some reason, I don't know what it is
[01:17:47] when you do jujitsu in grass, you're all itchy. Yeah. But even that's kind of not, you know how like,
[01:17:52] this is more when you're younger. You know, when you first learn jujitsu, oh, yeah, when you first
[01:17:57] learn and you're doing jujitsu every year. And you're at the party and everything's at that when you're a blue bell.
[01:18:02] You're just looking at everything like to mat. And yeah. So I think I think with other people,
[01:18:09] you know, some people obviously are not by the ocean, but you know, with anything outside,
[01:18:12] running hiking, biking, swimming, even playing outdoor sports, like soccer, and shooting basketball
[01:18:18] outside. This is whatever. Just get outside, just get outside, get out in the air, feel it. And I'll
[01:18:26] say one more thing about jujitsu and surfing. There's a little connection there. There's a little
[01:18:31] connection between jujitsu and surfing. I don't know what it is. Do you know what it is? What is
[01:18:35] balance? Well, you know, you got like even Kelly Slater who's, you know, what is either 11-time, 12-time
[01:18:43] champion of the world in surfing? He does jujitsu. You got guys like Joel Tutor. JT, if you don't know
[01:18:51] who Joel Tutor is, he's just legendary longboard surfer. And actually he's from San Diego. So we
[01:19:01] kick it with JT from time to time. And actually I see him on a regular basis. I had to,
[01:19:06] that the longboard surfing contest, because both his kid and my kid surf in the long, on the long
[01:19:11] boards. But Joel Tutor, who's a, who's a literally one of the most, you know, many people
[01:19:17] consider him to be the best longboard surfer of all time. Oh, dang. Of all time. Yeah, you didn't
[01:19:23] know he was that good. Did you? I knew he, all the time I didn't know that, but I believe it. And I'm
[01:19:28] not going to make that declaration, because then a million people will say no, it should be this
[01:19:32] guy. But there are many, there are many people in the world who consider Joel Tutor to be the best
[01:19:38] longboard surfer of all time. I met, I met Joel Tutor in jujitsu. You just started coming in and
[01:19:45] he, there was Shannon was like, Hey, roll with him. He's good at jujitsu. So I was like, Oh, cool.
[01:19:49] He was like a brown belt at the time and I roll and he's really good at jujitsu. And I was like,
[01:19:52] I'll get a cool Joel. And I see him during the day. It's like Melal group and he'd come to
[01:19:57] the end, roll with Joel sometime. Yeah. Really cool, Joel Tutor. He's this kind of guy who's smaller
[01:20:02] than me. We'll say. And he's better than me. Cool. Cool. One day, you know, who told me,
[01:20:07] Joel Tutor was a badass longboarder? Who? Kagnets. Kagnets? Is that Joel Tutor in that big
[01:20:12] guy? Is that what you in to under? Like, yeah, you know, he's probably a longboarder. He's so badass.
[01:20:17] Yeah. Yeah. And, and not as he's so awesome at surfing. He's jujitsu sick too. So Joel Tutor's
[01:20:26] one and then you get, then once you go, once you go Brazil, you know, in this scenario,
[01:20:30] then there's all kinds of surfing going on because that's a culture down there, you know,
[01:20:33] my first instructor, Fabio Santos. He's a, he's a badass surfer, Holy Lord Hicks and
[01:20:39] even kid Palagro. He's yeah. So, so there's definitely an end when you just meet
[01:20:47] guys surfing. There's like a decent chance that they train the jujitsu. Right. And so you said,
[01:20:53] you know what the connection is? I know of some connections, yes, which major ones.
[01:20:58] So educate. Okay. So me. It's one of these things where kind of on the surface, it feels like you
[01:21:08] against this big wash of a challenge, right? But really, it's not, it's not like this challenge
[01:21:16] that you take on. It's more of a challenge that you kind of just ride with. You know, it's more
[01:21:21] you yourself. So in and on top of it, and that could be an effective mountain climbing, whatever, but
[01:21:28] this is jujitsu and surfing is it always changes. It's not different. It may seem, same in one
[01:21:34] where another, it's same, but every single experience is different. Yeah. And it's not something
[01:21:39] you can just take control of. You know, it's not one of those things. It's you have to, you have to
[01:21:45] ride the weight. Yes. And surfing is literally in jujitsu. It's, you gotta go with it. You can't fight
[01:21:50] it. Just like you can't fight away. If you got it and it's, and they're both that. Yes. So of course,
[01:21:56] yeah, they take balance. But those are just little small physical, right? Because others force to balance.
[01:22:00] I don't do it. Yeah. But yeah, it's, it's you. I mean, it's kind of a spiritual type thing to say.
[01:22:05] It's you against yourself. Right. But that's really what it is. It's like you have to improve
[01:22:12] yourself. You know, it's not about conquering this, you know, maybe psychologically it is,
[01:22:18] but it's still within yourself. And it, and it's constantly changing. That's,
[01:22:22] getting philosophical. It's true. But I like it. Yeah. That's good. And my last comment on that was
[01:22:30] both of them, both surfing and jujitsu. Empty your brain. They empty my brain out. They empty my brain
[01:22:36] out. And they, they give me nice clean slate to do other things with. So that's that.
[01:22:45] All right. For the record, it come from Koi, but sorry, say I don't serve. Yeah. But,
[01:22:51] bra, I used to shred body, body, body and body, sponge. Yeah, total sponge. Oh, and by the way,
[01:23:01] it's my man, not why me. Oh, I, I'm not I'm correcting you because you're my friend.
[01:23:08] But I don't want to be a character. That's no correct. Correct. Correct. You mean,
[01:23:12] okay. Yeah. Absolutely. Why me. I guess, right? It's just pronunciation. Yeah.
[01:23:16] Don't let me up. But I'm wondering, go, what can I say? Why, man. Why, man. Be. Oh, I am.
[01:23:24] If you be a character too much, you become the guy that people are tolerating. So you don't want
[01:23:30] to be the guy at the party that people are tolerating. You don't want to be that guy. No matter how smart
[01:23:35] you want them to think you are, well, you just proved your, your intelligence. You gave me permission.
[01:23:40] All right. Next question. Started jujitsu this week and love it.
[01:23:48] I'm a former boxer and was thrilled that they let me spar on my first day.
[01:23:52] Is sparring on the first day too soon in your opinion? I was repeatedly told to tone it down
[01:23:58] by the higher belts. I thought I was tone in it down. Is jujitsu more like a dance or a street
[01:24:05] tuzzle? Am I supposed to relax and let these green and blue belts destroy me? I'm confused.
[01:24:12] This is such a great question. Because you see this all the time and you're just doing it.
[01:24:16] And I know from the from the podcast and from Twitter that there's so many people that are
[01:24:20] starting jujitsu because the podcast and that's definitely why I wanted to answer this one.
[01:24:25] Because it's how everybody feels when they start you. And you're always going to get
[01:24:31] the senior belts or the more experienced people telling you, hey man, you got to relax.
[01:24:37] By the way, if he's rolling with green belts, that means he's rolling with people under the age of 16.
[01:24:43] Yeah, you know, I actually had a little discussion. I've heard that there's some academies
[01:24:51] that give out green belts as an intermediate belt between white and blue. That there's a
[01:24:57] adults such. I have never heard of it, but I was told that the other day so that might be the
[01:25:02] situation here. Yeah, and by the way, I'll just go on record of saying, I disagree with it.
[01:25:07] Yeah, and you don't have a green belt as an adult. You should be white belt and then blue belt.
[01:25:12] That's the way it was and that's the way it should remain. Yeah, if I were in instructor,
[01:25:17] that's how it would do. But to me, hey man, do what you dig and he's doing jujitsu and the
[01:25:22] green belt. Yeah, that's the way it's been. In fact, he's an adult. He's doing jujitsu. Apparently long enough to get a green belt.
[01:25:28] I say hey. No, no, he's not a blue belt. Yeah, right. But he's got some guy in the event of this green belt that he's
[01:25:34] mentioned being an adult. Okay. Either way, I say, I say go do so. So yeah, now that now the reason that
[01:25:41] people are telling you to relax, they're trying to be helpful because you're going to learn more
[01:25:47] if you relax and you actually concentrate on the techniques that you've been told. The couple techniques
[01:25:52] that you've learned to try them. I'm not saying don't fight it because you, you have, you don't know what
[01:26:01] else to do. So you just use your horrible instincts to try and just muscle out of stuff and you
[01:26:08] get beat anyways. And that's why it's you're just beating your head against the wall. So they're trying
[01:26:13] to get you to relax and use the technique that you've learned and pay attention to what the other
[01:26:17] person's doing and think about where they're positioning their body and what they're doing and how
[01:26:24] that's working. So you can actually ask them and say hey, when you were holding me here, I couldn't
[01:26:28] move my arm. How are you holding that? So you can learn. If all you're trying to do is muscle out of it,
[01:26:32] you're not thinking about what's happening and that's, that's not a good sign. Yeah, I think it's
[01:26:38] funny because relax, you know, when you hear relax as a, as a way out enough, you're even remember
[01:26:42] when you're away, but when they say relax, more accurately put, they should say, not they should say,
[01:26:52] but they're saying try to relax. Yes. We know everyone knows, they guys not going to relax.
[01:26:58] He's over here rolling with a guy. He doesn't know anything. Of course, guys in Mount, which is like,
[01:27:03] you know, super uncomfortable with being, of course, he can be trying to flip out, try to get out of
[01:27:07] there. He doesn't know the moves. So he can't be like, you know, I'm going to relax and do all the moves.
[01:27:12] I know. He knows two moves. He's his first day, whatever. So yeah, try to relax. And I think that's a
[01:27:20] good point where don't be going so hard in spashing out. So hard that nothing's going through
[01:27:25] your mind as far as what position is this guy on me. You know, I remember not my first first day,
[01:27:31] but early on where side control, I barely even realized the difference between a side control and a,
[01:27:38] you know, half guard situation. And that's one of the things that as time went on, I wish I would
[01:27:43] had known, you know, like, okay, this is side control. And if you would have been more aware and less
[01:27:50] fighting, right? You would have said, oh, wait, he's got my leg trap. That's what feels different.
[01:27:54] Exactly. Right. That's the game. You got to you got to switch your game to this side control game.
[01:27:58] You know, yep. And what's telling someone, am I supposed to let these green and blue belts
[01:28:05] destroy you? No, but you got to remember, you can't look at it like a fight. It's not a fight.
[01:28:12] Yeah. It's not a fight. You know what it is? Don't let them destroy you. Let them educate you.
[01:28:18] That's what when you're rolling with a higher belt, especially when you don't know them very much at
[01:28:22] all, they're educating you. You should be trying to pay attention. And let's just take this off
[01:28:28] the mats and in the life. Because when you get into a situation, an unknown situation, what are you
[01:28:36] going to do? Are you going to fight and struggle against when someone has more knowledge than you
[01:28:41] about some topic? Are you going to fight against them? No, just be quiet. Listen, and learn.
[01:28:47] When you're in a new scenario, you're something you've never done before. Are you going to
[01:28:52] try and compete and win? And this thing you've never done before? Are you going to try and learn and
[01:28:56] be educated? My recommendation is to learn to be educated because you're not going to win.
[01:29:01] Lest it's a miracle, but most situations don't allow for miracles. So when you're in life,
[01:29:10] relax, try and learn. When you're on the mat, relax, try and learn. Try to really try to
[01:29:17] relax. You've got to try and relax. It's here. And when I don't, maybe it's just me, but when I think
[01:29:26] of the whole spectrum, when I first started versus you just right now, and of course, I don't
[01:29:31] have it all figured out. But when I kind of reflect on that whole learning process, I like the fact that
[01:29:39] I couldn't really relax at the beginning because you start to realize, oh, I see how I learned
[01:29:44] that right there. You know, I see how I see the difference now in the time where I didn't really know
[01:29:51] how to relax versus even like the time where I thought I knew how to relax, but after, you know,
[01:29:56] a 10 minutes, oh, dying versus, you know, now where you can go 10, 20 hard, you know,
[01:30:02] in fine place where you could relax and be able to basically control the scenarios where you can't
[01:30:06] relax. I like that. I like that the beginning, you can't relax. This is like in the beginning,
[01:30:11] you didn't know certain relaxing is yet another move. Yeah, there you go.
[01:30:16] Yeah, I rolled with Dean tonight, Dean Lester, and he was all fired up because he'd been on the
[01:30:22] trip. And so he's like, Hey, let's roll. So we rolled and he got the mountain position.
[01:30:32] And I just was down there relaxing speaking of relaxing. I was just down there relaxing. And
[01:30:37] I'm relaxing, but I'm just doing a little bit of off-balancing of him. So he can't really relax
[01:30:45] 100%. And it took me a few minutes, like about five, but I got out of the mountain and got back
[01:30:52] to another position and got back to the car. So it's, you're right, relaxing is actually a technique in
[01:30:58] Gigiitsu. Yeah. So in a big part of it, not the whole thing, but a big part of it is just being conscious of it.
[01:31:07] You know, maybe I'm spashing too much or something. Of course, with everything it's going to come
[01:31:12] with wraps, it's going to come with experience and stuff like that. But yeah. And by the way, Dean would tell
[01:31:16] you, and I would tend to agree with him, not only to relaxing a technique, spashing is almost
[01:31:23] so attacking. And sometimes, you know, Dean will get some position on me and I will spas to get out of it.
[01:31:29] Now, I'm not encouraging the person that wrote this question to start working on their spas technique.
[01:31:33] Don't start working on that till later. Save that right now. Start with your relaxed technique.
[01:31:38] Yeah. Yeah. All right. Next question.
[01:31:45] In regards to podcast number 23 in the art of war, many of the rules seem very simplistic and
[01:31:51] black and white. Take this one, for example. When the enemy occupies high ground, do not confront
[01:31:56] him. If he attacks downhill, do not oppose him. Where does that leave us with battles like Normandy,
[01:32:03] where troops had to get up those cliffs? What about the IDF conquering the Goalon, Goalon,
[01:32:11] Goalon Heights? Goalon Heights in the sixth day war. There are many other examples I could give.
[01:32:19] It's obviously not ideal to do such things as fighting a well-intrenched enemy uphill,
[01:32:24] but dealing with less than ideal situations is a part of war.
[01:32:30] We should all be so lucky as to only be able to choose battles that fit the art of war.
[01:32:35] But from my experience, it's often not an option in real life.
[01:32:41] And you have to somehow get it done anyway. So yeah, this is a pretty simple question with a
[01:32:46] pretty simple answer to. Don't forget that the laws or the the art of war and the laws and the
[01:32:54] art of war, the rules, the simplistic back and white rules in the art of war are governed by
[01:33:00] other rules that say to break the rules themselves. So just to pull out a couple quotes,
[01:33:07] I went and pulled these out. Sunsu says, he who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent
[01:33:14] and thereby succeed in winning may be called a heaven-born captain. So if you can adapt
[01:33:23] to the situation, then adapt your tactics and modify your tactics. So attacking uphill is a
[01:33:29] modification of a tactic, right? Yes. The next one I pulled out. Sunsu says,
[01:33:36] do not repeat tactics that have gained you one victory. But let your methods be regulated by the
[01:33:44] infinite variety of circumstances. That answers the question in its own right. Let your methods
[01:33:55] be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances. And the last little quote I pulled up from
[01:34:03] Sunsu, according as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans. So there's three
[01:34:12] rules from the art of war that tell you to change the rules of the art of war when you have to.
[01:34:21] So yeah, you're told to avoid these situations, but sometimes you have to. Now it's also
[01:34:29] important to remember that the philosophy of the art of war generally espouses an indirect methodology
[01:34:38] of combat, where oftentimes you're trying to keep yourself safe and inflict damage when you can.
[01:34:49] That implies that maybe I have less physical strength or size than my opponent. So I've less
[01:34:58] soldiers or less equipment than my opponent. And from that perspective, let me ask you
[01:35:04] to would it be smart to attack Normandy if you actually didn't have the numbers to carry out the
[01:35:12] attack? You didn't have the overwhelming force that we had a mast on England to go in a
[01:35:18] sole France. It wouldn't make sense. Then it would make sense to continue to obey the principles
[01:35:27] in the art of war, which is you know what we're not going to attack head on. We're going to figure
[01:35:31] out another way to do it. So like I said, these are rules, but these are rules like all rules
[01:35:41] that are meant to be broken when the time calls for it. So good question, but it's a, it's a,
[01:35:48] the art of war answers that question in itself.
[01:35:57] Jockel, how do the seals reconcile themselves with the fact they face death on every
[01:36:04] operation they undertake more so than the conventional forces? Is this something that is learned?
[01:36:12] Well, first of all, let me make it perfectly clear that this is not true. What is it? Well,
[01:36:18] first of all, the part that you face death on every operation, there's a little chance, but further
[01:36:23] more and more importantly, this idea that the seals or special operations unit face death more
[01:36:32] so than conventional forces, not true. In fact, in many cases seals are safer than the conventional
[01:36:40] forces. The conventional forces are out there doing very difficult operations that are oftentimes
[01:36:48] more dangerous. I mean, even just something as simple as going on a logistics convoy.
[01:36:55] You are, I mean, I reckon Afghanistan, you are extremely exposed in those situations. You're on the
[01:37:01] defensive because you're in a convoy. You're just waiting to get blown up.
[01:37:07] And so that situation is you're facing your much, you're much more exposed in that situation
[01:37:16] doing a daytime convoy run down ID roads, then you would be if you were doing a night patrol
[01:37:25] through the same area. There's just, that's just the way it is. I mean, there's other operations,
[01:37:28] too, I mean, presence patrols and senses operations. There's all kinds of
[01:37:34] operations that the conventional units do that are extremely dangerous. They also oftentimes have
[01:37:41] less support. So for instance, there's an aircraft called an AC 130 that is just a miraculous
[01:37:50] piece of equipment, just an incredible weapon system. And it's an airplane that flies around a 10,000
[01:37:59] feet and it can see everything because as these incredible, incredible imagery systems on it.
[01:38:07] So they can see everything that's happening, they can track, they can end and they can shoot and
[01:38:10] destroy anything they want. So a lot of times the special operations units will have
[01:38:17] for instance something like an AC 130 supporting them. You know, on top of that, special operations
[01:38:23] they get really good training. So you've got this, this, out-send of the conventional forces
[01:38:30] often have great training as well, but sometimes they don't have the best training in the world.
[01:38:34] Then you're in a, you're in a sea of puttons or you're in a special operations,
[01:38:38] you know, in a special forces ODA, you can have some good training under your belt that you've
[01:38:44] been going through for many, many years so that training makes you say for as well. And, you know,
[01:38:50] you're going to get oftentimes again, you're going to get better gear in special operations
[01:38:54] because they have a big budget for a smaller number of people. The logistical support,
[01:38:59] the flexibility that you have in special operations is usually, it's usually better. I mean,
[01:39:07] like the logistics in the army or the Marine Corps is awesome and and it definitely is better than
[01:39:14] special operations, but special operations is usually is always supporting a much smaller unit.
[01:39:20] So even though the logistics people or systems might not be as good, they're overwhelmingly good
[01:39:27] for the small number of people that are in special operations. So, you know, I'll just go one step further.
[01:39:35] A lot of times, you know, in Ramadi, the conventional guys, they were living out in the city.
[01:39:41] They were living out in the city of Ramadi after we put combat outposts in place. You know,
[01:39:46] we seals would return to base after a few days out in the field. These guys stayed out there.
[01:39:51] So we'd return back and, you know, get it, get a shower and get some good food and
[01:39:57] relax and we had permanent guards that kind of guarded our base with a really big perimeter.
[01:40:02] So we were in a good spot to stand down for the most part.
[01:40:07] Whereas the conventional guys, they're out there in Ramadi. They're standing watch, you know,
[01:40:11] oh, you know, we go back and can take a break and go on the internet. When they take a break,
[01:40:16] they're going into a watch tower. So I just don't, I just want to make sure I make it perfectly clear
[01:40:22] that, you know, the conventional's are by no means doing anything less risky than the special
[01:40:30] operations. In fact, most of the time they're doing things that are more risky.
[01:40:34] Tough formations, higher risk, you know, that's just the way it is. So that's why, you know,
[01:40:44] we have just the utmost respect and admiration for the conventional units that we work with in Ramadi.
[01:40:51] And I'll tell you the guys, that's how we feel. So now the question becomes, how do we
[01:40:58] any service member face death is the question? And again, it's any service member.
[01:41:06] Anybody that's going to war has to realize that there's a possibility that they could get killed.
[01:41:12] And so what do you, how do you get over that? For me, it was acceptance and saying to myself,
[01:41:19] you know what? Okay, I could get killed and it could happen tonight. It could happen tomorrow.
[01:41:26] It could happen in a week. I don't know when it's going to happen, but it could happen.
[01:41:31] And you know what? I'm not afraid of it. So if I'm afraid of it, that's going to be hard to
[01:41:37] deal with every single day. The other piece of it is, you deal with it by mitigating as much
[01:41:44] risk as you possibly can. Okay, what can we do? How can I make sure that I'm safe? You know,
[01:41:48] how I make sure that I'm safe? I can say it's a possible. I train hard. I make sure my guys
[01:41:52] are training hard. I make sure my guys are dieted and I make sure that they know what the plan is
[01:41:58] when we go out of the battlefield. That's what you do. You mitigate as much risk as you can. And then
[01:42:05] there's areas where you can't mitigate risk. There's areas where you could catch a,
[01:42:11] you could find an ID, you could find a bullet, you could find a bomb and that's it.
[01:42:19] And you can't, in my mind, you can't worry about things that you can't control.
[01:42:29] So the things that you can't control, accept them and let's focus on mitigating what we
[01:42:34] came control. And I think that's probably, that's what I did when I was in those situations.
[01:42:42] And I would tell you that that's what most of the guys that I was with had something along those
[01:42:48] lines in their brains. Yeah, that acceptance is such a powerful thing. Like if you just accept
[01:42:58] something like, okay, I'm at risk of this or I'm like, this is going to be a terrible crude example,
[01:43:09] comparatively speaking compared to what? Compared to accepting the risk of death. But let's hear it.
[01:43:15] Let's say you, you missed it a long example. Let's see, you go to work. The fans wanted to say that.
[01:43:22] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, let's say you go to work and right when you walk in one of
[01:43:26] your coworkers and him and John, your boss is looking for you. He's going to, and you know, you did
[01:43:31] something you messed it up. You blew up some meeting. I don't know, whatever messed up with the claim.
[01:43:36] You're like, hey man, the boss is looking for you. And you're like, yeah, I was just so you're going
[01:43:40] to avoid the boss at all costs. Oh, that's good. Make sure you don't. Yeah. So let's say you avoid them one day.
[01:43:45] The whole day, boom, you've clocked out your out. Next day, same thing. Oh, she's looking for even
[01:43:50] more even more even more after a while. It's going to weigh on you. And once you just feel like,
[01:43:56] I'm going to get chewed out. Let me just accept it. And then, you know, you can go through it.
[01:44:02] Stress is gone. Yeah. Really. Yeah. Um, analogy accepted. Yeah.
[01:44:09] Oh, or like, for example, oh, oh, it's like a bully is looking for you. Yeah, let's go.
[01:44:15] Yeah. Like, you know, well, I don't know if you've been bullied in school, but um, like,
[01:44:19] if someone's looking for you, they're mad at you or whatever. And you know, they're looking for you.
[01:44:22] The bully. And you're like, man, you're avoiding when you're avoiding them. After why you just
[01:44:27] all right, I accept it. You know, something's going to have to go down. I'm going to have to
[01:44:31] experience this confrontation. Yeah. In really the acceptance point would be to say, you know,
[01:44:35] what, what's the worst thing that could happen? The worst thing that happened. He beats me up. I
[01:44:38] get a bloody nose. I don't care anymore. I'm going to go get it. Yeah. Because what you're talking
[01:44:44] about really is facing the problem, which I also support. You know what, you got a problem, whether
[01:44:48] it's meeting with your boss or what you're going to get bullied, I'm going to face that problem.
[01:44:52] So that's one piece. But one thing that will help you to face the problem is saying,
[01:44:57] okay, what's the worst thing that happens? You know what, I go into my boss. He might fire me.
[01:45:01] Okay, if he fires me, I'm going to have to go get a new job. But that's the worst thing that's
[01:45:04] going to happen. Right. What's the worst thing that happens if I get into fight with a bully?
[01:45:08] Worst thing that happens. I'm going to get a bloody nose and we'll get beat up. Yeah. But you know what,
[01:45:13] I can handle that. So I'm going to go face this issue. And it's the same thing in combat. What's the
[01:45:17] worst thing that happens? Worst thing that happens? I'm going to get killed. Okay. That happens. It's
[01:45:24] over. I'm good with it. Let's go out and face it. And you know, honestly, I said it's the worst thing,
[01:45:29] but honestly, the thing that guys are usually the most afraid of is having their friends get
[01:45:33] her, they're guys get hurt. That's the worst thing. Yeah. So, bully. And then even how you said
[01:45:38] that the training helps. And that seems obvious, you know, but I think even that is, that's like
[01:45:45] it kind of an understated. I think under appreciated. Because you know, like remember,
[01:45:50] for USC came out. And I remember looking and being that poor. These guys are nuts to go in there
[01:45:56] to do that. But once you learn even just some jujitsu, just some jujitsu, you think that what you see,
[01:46:04] like them fighting in the USC and stuff like that's I could do that. Yeah. You all, yeah. And actually
[01:46:08] that's one of the reasons why I started, I started jujitsu. I didn't start jujitsu. I want to be a fighter.
[01:46:13] So I trained in MMA first. And before training that, I would have thought you're
[01:46:19] completely insane to do that. You got to be like kind of crazy person. But once you have the
[01:46:23] training, you see, okay, you know, kind of just, yeah, you get a normal life. You see, like, okay, I see all this
[01:46:28] stuff. You have just a just a vast understanding rather than all you see is knuckles and blood and arms
[01:46:36] breaking. That's the next question. Jockel, good evening. In a leadership position, is it okay to take
[01:46:48] or ask for suggestions on solving a task or is it okay to take suggestions that stray from my initial
[01:46:55] plan? Yes. Yes. And I hope that this that would made you decide to ask this question because you just
[01:47:10] like found out about the podcast or the book or whatever because this is something that absolutely
[01:47:19] anybody that kind of listens will would say yes, absolutely. In your leadership position,
[01:47:26] you should definitely ask for suggestions, take suggestions, share the planning,
[01:47:34] let other people let many brains be smarter than your one brain. That's what you want. You want
[01:47:41] to utilize the brain power of your team. Now, the reason you're asking this question,
[01:47:47] little bit scary, little bit of a red flag. The reason you're asking this question is because you're
[01:47:50] afraid of what it'll look like if you have to ask, hey, guys, I'm not sure how to do this or
[01:47:56] you're afraid of what it means that you're going to look that you're going to look weak. You're
[01:48:01] going to look like a weak leader. That's your experience. That's your inner experience. That's your
[01:48:05] insecurity. That's making that happen. Don't be insecure. Don't be insecure because the open mind
[01:48:12] and the asking for suggestions and the taking suggestions, it actually makes you look like a
[01:48:18] better leader. I know that sounds crazy. It actually makes you look like a better leader when you say,
[01:48:23] hey, you know what, echo, we got this problem a soft, not 100% sure how to tackle this one. Can
[01:48:28] you give me a hand? Can you give me some suggestions here? That doesn't make you say, oh,
[01:48:34] Jocca doesn't know his game. He's an idiot. No, because I'm a man. Jocca was humble. He's looking for
[01:48:38] input. He wants to work together as a team. So, yes, absolutely. Ask for suggestions, take suggestions,
[01:48:51] have an open mind. This regard your plan if your plan wasn't good. I'm not just going to hold
[01:48:59] fast to a plan because I'm the one that thought of it. That's not good leadership at all. Don't
[01:49:06] do that. Open your mind. Yeah. Yeah, I'm asking for asking for suggestions. And this kind of kind
[01:49:16] of what you said already is it helps with making everyone feel even more involved. Oh, you mean
[01:49:24] it spreads the ownership throughout the team? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Lead echo Charles. Yeah. And
[01:49:29] indeed, that improves. I know as like if, if, you know, you're leader, whatever, and the leader was asking
[01:49:36] me for my input. And I gave it to him. And you know, any, I mean, I would feel just that much more valuable
[01:49:41] in part of the team. I'd be more enthusiastic now. Right. Now, who's going to work harder in a project?
[01:49:46] You, when I come in and say, hey, can you give me a hand? How do you think we should do this? And
[01:49:50] you come up with a suggestion and you start working on that plan? You're going to go a lot harder
[01:49:53] than if I come in and say, hey, here's what I want you to do. Follow my instructions. Yeah. As soon as
[01:49:58] you come up to an obstacle, and I've all I've told you do is follow my instructions. As soon as you
[01:50:03] come to an obstacle, you're going to be like, ah, you know what, A, I need, this isn't working. Right.
[01:50:08] Whereas if it was your plan, you come up to an obstacle, you tackle that thing. You get after it.
[01:50:15] That's what happens. You know, you know, you're saying like sometimes where, you know, as a leader,
[01:50:19] you might be reluctant to ask for suggestions because you might come up like an experience or something like that.
[01:50:28] If you need a suggestion and you're like, oh, I don't want to sound like that or whatever,
[01:50:33] and you say, you know, whatever, I'm just going to go hit move forward anyway. You know,
[01:50:38] and you're not know the best way to do it. Oh. And you're going to look dumb. And then you know,
[01:50:42] all like, we talked about this before, where if you don't know what you're doing, but you're acting like,
[01:50:47] you know, you're a pro. Just a transparent man. If you're way more transparent than you think, and that goes
[01:50:52] pretty much with everything you do. Right. It's like name droppers. You know, when people like drop
[01:50:55] names, they don't really think that people are going to pick up on it, but oh my gosh,
[01:50:59] smell that thing from one mile away, something he's out like tonight. I was like, well, you know,
[01:51:03] journalists, Twitter, doing what kicking it exactly up. Hey, it's been 26 podcasts. And I haven't talked
[01:51:11] about having done much name dropping. J. J. T. Joe, you're the first one. They drop in. You should say
[01:51:18] Joe Tudor, because you could be talking about J. T. T. T. T. Oh, no, I'm talking about Joe T. J. J. J. J. J.
[01:51:23] And I guess I dropped Jeffy Glovers name, but those guys, we we drop Greg Train's name, too.
[01:51:28] You know what I mean? We drop. We drop everybody. Like, everywhere that we train with, we
[01:51:34] we drop their names, but just no one knows who they are. Right. Yeah. So it's like Andy or big
[01:51:40] Eric. I mean, we talked about these guys. Well, technically, that wouldn't be named dropping
[01:51:45] them technically, like, name dropping, like, well, then Ian, but what if I said, hey, I was training
[01:51:49] with big Eric tonight, but it's such and such. Yeah, see if it's, but actually, it was
[01:51:53] training with Dean Lister tonight. Well, yeah, it depends on the context you're trying to add. If you're trying to
[01:51:57] add into the story, the fact that I know this guy that therefore makes me hit for cool like this guy,
[01:52:04] or on his level, whatever, or associated with him, so I'm cool, whatever that's the game dropping.
[01:52:08] But if you're just trying to paint a more accurate picture of your experience or your story,
[01:52:11] or the fact of the matter is, like I was training with Dean tonight, right? You know,
[01:52:19] yeah, see, so it added context to the story, but I said, Dean, and then you went, you
[01:52:24] can't reverse it. Or came back to say, do you lose, do you? That's neat. Nonetheless, the point is,
[01:52:30] if you start carrying on, you know, you don't know that you need suggestions, and you say,
[01:52:36] you know, whatever, I'm just going to move forward by thinking to smell that on you, that you're
[01:52:40] black like that. Yeah, I'm laughing some negative name dropping right now. It's true, that
[01:52:47] the point there is, you're a lot more transparent than you think, like a lot of people, and
[01:52:51] some people, you know, it's funny. You keep using transparent in its, in its, the way that the
[01:52:57] business community uses transparent right now, they use it in a positive way. Yeah, okay, look,
[01:53:01] we're just going to be completely transparent on how we're doing this. Yeah, you're using it
[01:53:05] in a, in a little bit of a negative way. Like, hey, I can see through your, your crap here. Yeah,
[01:53:11] yeah, and I tend to use it in both, like I use it in both. Yeah, I'm using both. But part of
[01:53:15] this thing kind of kind of thing, but I like that. I read that. I'm not sure if I'm signed
[01:53:21] for it, but nonetheless, yeah, they'll see right through that if you need suggestions, and that's
[01:53:26] on top to add to the fact that all this other stuff that it makes the team feel more valuable,
[01:53:31] it's a more, it's a better overall way to, to me. There's no doubt about it. No doubt,
[01:53:36] maybe by the way, in case you're wondering the best military planning units, whether it's the
[01:53:40] sealed teams or whether it's the army that I work with or whether it's some ring core, the more open they
[01:53:45] are in their planning, taking suggestions from, throughout the chain of command, of the better
[01:53:49] off they do period and the story. I should have just answered with that and we're going to move on.
[01:53:53] That's the way it works. Next question. This is a question slash clarification.
[01:54:03] Could you elaborate on flanking? My impression was that it meant to move around to attack from
[01:54:10] the side instead of head on, but as often as it comes up on your podcast, I get the impression
[01:54:15] there must be more to it, or at least some interesting nuances. I guess there's not that much more to
[01:54:24] it. I mean, a little piece of it was you want to distract them a little bit to the front,
[01:54:29] and then you want to flank them. That's about the only additional information that's needed to
[01:54:35] understand what flank is. Flank is yes, you attack you instead of attacking head on you attack
[01:54:40] from the side or sometimes the rear. I'll tell you just to point this out for anyone out there that's
[01:54:47] either in the military and law enforcement and you're going to flank and you're going to go
[01:54:52] to the rear. Just remember that on a large scale at works because you have distance where your
[01:54:58] weapon tree won't impact friendly lines, but if you surround someone or you come from the rear of
[01:55:07] let's say a small target building or a situation with an open environment, but you're surrounding
[01:55:16] an enemy. Just don't forget that when you surround an enemy, you now you're cutting off your own
[01:55:22] field to fire. So that's why you shouldn't do that. You should just stick with the flank,
[01:55:27] where that way you can still keep shooting and keep your field to fire as open as possible.
[01:55:31] I just wanted to throw that in there, but that's what it is. Military terms it means you're attacking
[01:55:36] the side, you're attacking the weak point, which is generally the sides. Now, it's the same thing,
[01:55:42] obviously in GJitsu, you don't attack what they're defending. You attack their knack attack,
[01:55:47] their knack attack, they forget about their knack and boom, you flank them and get their arm.
[01:55:51] Greg Train said that to me tonight. He was like, oh, that was a little flanky. He says to me,
[01:55:58] Greg Train. So did I just name drop? What if I said, Dean Lister said it that it would be a
[01:56:06] name drop? If you said Greg Train told me that, well, today while I was hanging out with Dean
[01:56:11] Dean Lister, that would have been a name. All right, I won't do that. So, but then you get,
[01:56:17] so now you get flanky and we've talked about this before when you're talking about dealing with people.
[01:56:24] Then yes, you don't want to attack where people are dug in. You don't want to attack what they are
[01:56:29] defending. When someone has a strong point of view that they're married to, don't attack that.
[01:56:37] It's someone has a big giant ego, don't attack that flanky.
[01:56:42] It may, may be even just give a little bit of massage to that ego to distract them and then sneak
[01:56:52] in from the flank with your idea and you put it in there. If someone's got a plan that they're
[01:56:59] defending hard core, don't attack the plan. Come up with a little way to augment the plan, a little
[01:57:07] twist on the plan that they already have. So you're accepting their plan, but you're putting your
[01:57:11] spin on it. And that way, they accept it because it's part of what, it's part of their plan.
[01:57:22] So it works. So once again, don't beat your head against the wall 487 times. Just flank.
[01:57:31] Real simple. That's all it is. We have, and a lot of times it's a figurative thing.
[01:57:39] Yes, well, obviously. And there's like all these little things he who flanks first wins
[01:57:46] and flank or be flanked. There's one more. There's a million of them. But
[01:57:53] when and out flank. Yeah, there's all these little things. But the great thing about it is also
[01:57:59] just mentally. If we're trying to solve a problem and we're just thinking one way of the problem
[01:58:05] when you get stuck in that white flank. When you come up to a, when you come up to an obstacle,
[01:58:10] flank. When you get a resistance and you can't figure something out, flank. That's what I'm talking
[01:58:18] about. Just always have that in your head. I'm always doing that emotionally dealing with relationships
[01:58:26] scenarios. You got your relationship, your wife. She's dug in on something. Don't
[01:58:35] us. That thing. Flank. Is that kind of like, um, you want to go to,
[01:58:42] train you, Jitu, but you'd gone like a bunch of, no, no, you want to go to Taco Tuesday.
[01:58:47] Or something. I don't know wherever you go. And you know, it's her birthday.
[01:58:51] I go to a steak Saturday. Yeah, steak Saturday. So you buy your wife flowers the day or two days
[01:58:59] before, right? Yeah. Instead of being like, I'm gonna, I'm the man. I'm going because I said,
[01:59:04] so you buy either her the flowers. You flank them. And then when that day comes, you have the quote
[01:59:10] unquote opportunity to see some friends just a quick one, one night. She'll remember those flowers
[01:59:15] because she's on the, on the, on the, you know, the distractions. You distract her. You flank. You
[01:59:20] flank. You're like, on Jurassic Park, you know, those, the raptors. You're, you're a
[01:59:25] Jurassic Park. I have. It was quite some time ago. So, okay. So, it was about dinosaurs. Yeah. Yeah. So,
[01:59:30] the T-Rex. The T-Rex can't really see that good. So, you just remain still. You keep,
[01:59:35] you remain real still. He can't really see you because he sees movement. But the raptors,
[01:59:39] they're, they're these like, they're a little meet, many T-Rexes. They flank though, don't they?
[01:59:43] They flank. So, one of them is like messing with you, like engaging you and you think, okay,
[01:59:47] I'm not going to move or maybe I'll move or whatever. And then the other T-Rex. Then they enjoy
[01:59:52] you as their meal. That's a flank. It's a pre-holic. When in doubt, flank. Get that mindset.
[02:00:00] It's a good mindset to have. I think you're right. The flank.
[02:00:07] Next question. At what point do you turn off the manipulation tactics with people that you work with?
[02:00:13] Or don't you. So, this question, I actually pulled this from a friend of mine. Not a good,
[02:00:23] not someone I've known for a long time, but someone that's a guy that I know. He doesn't know
[02:00:27] me well enough, but he knows well enough to ask me this question. Sure. Right? And he actually
[02:00:32] sent me to text. He's like, you know, I've been thinking, after listening to your podcast,
[02:00:36] are you just manipulating people all the time? Yeah. And it's a legit question, right? I have that
[02:00:42] question. Yeah, even echo has that question. So, I obviously have talked about leadership and
[02:00:49] influence as manipulation, because that's what they are. Right? If I'm trying to get you to do something,
[02:00:58] you could say I'm leading you, but you could also say I'm manipulating you. Okay? And the difference
[02:01:02] to me, and I can say I've pointed out this difference before, the difference to me is that if I'm trying
[02:01:07] to do something that's going to benefit you or benefit the team, then that's leadership or that's
[02:01:14] influence. If I'm trying to get you to do something and it's going to benefit me, then that's
[02:01:19] manipulation. I've talked about that before. So, that being said, I am not running around in full
[02:01:29] manipulation mode all the time. I'm not constantly sitting there trying to plot and make people do things.
[02:01:40] I will say this though, I am generally conscious or aware or detached enough that I can see my
[02:01:49] interactions with other people from a good enough distance to see how I'm affecting the situation.
[02:01:55] So, it's there. You know, I'm aware of it. I do have a couple friends not many, where I'm
[02:02:03] just completely unfiltered, some of the times, maybe even most of the time, but with most people,
[02:02:12] like I said, I'm at least aware of what I'm saying and what I'm doing and how it's being received.
[02:02:19] It's modulated though, and I'm not sitting there manipulating everyone that I
[02:02:25] meet and the fact that matter is the reason it is, most of the time, I don't care. Not that
[02:02:30] don't care about them, but I'm not, I'm not, I have no reason. I am not trying to do something with
[02:02:35] this person. I'm just interacting with the person and I like to interact with different people,
[02:02:40] and I have, I get along well with a lot of different types of people from straight-laced,
[02:02:47] like religious people to freaking out wall bikers to surfers to alcoholics, to to fitness
[02:02:58] freaks. I mean, I'm friends with a bunch of different people, and I'm definitely not sitting
[02:03:03] around trying to manipulate them. I'm trying to enjoy, and I enjoy the various
[02:03:10] personalities and sort of decisions and life that people had. I learned from them.
[02:03:17] I'm not trying to manipulate, I'm actually trying to learn from people most of the time. Not manipulate.
[02:03:25] But when I do get in a team setting or a business setting or a relationship setting,
[02:03:31] we're now what we're doing is an interaction of humans, then I definitely will be thinking about
[02:03:46] how my actions and reactions are affecting the situation. And I will tell you this,
[02:03:52] I'm generally only doing it for good. I'm not trying to get things from people. I think you
[02:04:02] would be one to say, like, I'm pretty generous with what I'm trying to do with my life and
[02:04:10] and with helping people. Not that I find myself to be like some healer or some benevolent
[02:04:17] person that's running around. I'm not trying to say that, but I'm generally what I'm
[02:04:21] interacting with someone enough that I'm in this mode. I am trying to help. I'm trying to help us.
[02:04:31] That's what I'm trying to do. So if this is manipulation to try and help people and try to help
[02:04:42] whatever it is I'm doing with other people to move in the right direction if that's manipulation.
[02:04:47] I'm guilty. Yeah, and you see, you kind of mentioned that too, you're using the word manipulation.
[02:04:53] I use it where most people don't like to say it. Most people say, you know what? I really like to
[02:04:59] influence my friends and move them in the right direction. Well, what is that doing? That's
[02:05:03] manipulating. Yeah, so if you look at the definition, it's to handle cunningly. That's when
[02:05:08] manipulation is nice. Well, there's another dimension in that too. But I think that's a more general
[02:05:13] broad. Yeah, but I think the generally accepted meaning of the word manipulate has a negative
[02:05:19] connotation for sure. And it is rightfully so because it generally, when you say it,
[02:05:25] you're talking about, oh, Jocco is really manipulating echo. So does that mean? Oh,
[02:05:30] Jocco is trying to get stuff from echo. He's trying to, he's trying to do stuff for his own benefit.
[02:05:34] Whereas if I were to say, you know, Jocco, he's been hanging out with echo a lot.
[02:05:38] And he's really having a good influence on him. Well, guys, what? That's cool. Oh, everyone's happy.
[02:05:44] Now, but what did I really do? I really manipulated you. Right. I really made you act a certain way.
[02:05:49] I led you. I manipulated you. Yeah. So again, I mean, maybe I need to stop using the word manipulation.
[02:05:56] But I always, well, the reason I like to use it because I know it. I know it makes people think.
[02:06:00] I know it makes people see leadership for what it is with leadership. You're trying to get
[02:06:03] other human beings to do what you want them to do. That's what you're trying to do. Now, in the
[02:06:09] best form of leadership, you're trying to get them to want to do what you want them to do.
[02:06:14] And even in better form of leadership, you're trying to get them to do what they want to do.
[02:06:19] And it happens to be what you want them to be to do, to do, too. That's the goal.
[02:06:25] Well, but all of those means I'm trying to get you to do something. Yeah.
[02:06:33] And whether we want to call it leadership or we want to call it influence or we want to call it
[02:06:37] inspiration or we want to call it manipulation, it's the same thing. The only difference being
[02:06:43] in my mind when I manipulate something, I'm trying to help myself. And I don't do that.
[02:06:50] Right. I'm not trying to help myself. Yeah, manipulate through other people.
[02:06:55] Yeah, it sounds like that it's helping yourself at their expense. Exactly.
[02:07:01] And the influence is even more broad. I think he being goes outside of many people just because
[02:07:07] influence, you can passively influence someone. You can just hang around with someone.
[02:07:10] But you come with us on women, they're people, too. Yeah.
[02:07:15] Yes, you can. You can absolutely passively women, they're people. Like, and not know you're doing it.
[02:07:19] Yeah, you can. Well, no, you can do it by not doing something. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's like
[02:07:25] passive aggressive manipulation. Yes. But like, influences, let's say we're just cruising
[02:07:30] and we're hanging out. You're not telling me or asking me or whatever to do something. You're just
[02:07:34] being you and I'm like, fuck, Jack was so cool man. Let me, let me roll up myself like,
[02:07:38] Jack would does, you know, that's in the comments. That's I wouldn't call that money.
[02:07:41] But that wouldn't be manipulation. Yeah, but what if I intentionally was like, you know what,
[02:07:45] I really need to get. I really need to get echo to do acts. Yeah. Yeah. And here's what I'm
[02:07:49] going to do. I'm going to show them. I'm going to lead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and really,
[02:07:56] isn't, so that being said, isn't. Being just, just being, being polite.
[02:08:03] Isn't that a low form of minute? Absolutely. If I say, hey, would it be possible for you to,
[02:08:09] you know, grab that chair for me? What do you mean, would it be possible? We know that's possible.
[02:08:12] Yes. But we don't. We know it's possible. I know it possible. Meant. Why did you say, if possible?
[02:08:18] Why did I say that? Because I want you to feel good about it. If it depends, if you want to feel good,
[02:08:24] you want to feel, you know, it's like you don't want to be a feminist. Absolutely. It's interacting
[02:08:28] with other people. Right. So you have to show some form of if we want to use the word
[02:08:33] manipulation, which we do obviously, um, yeah, you're always doing. So in a way, it's pretty rare.
[02:08:38] You're going to turn it up. Yeah. Really. Yeah. Really. And so I guess to answer the question once again,
[02:08:45] do I ever turn it off? Not really. Am I walking around trying to manipulate people and get them
[02:08:49] to fall under my spell of destruction? Hang on. No. I'm just a normal guy that's interacting with
[02:08:57] people on a regular way. And when I'm dealing with people in an interactive situation,
[02:09:04] I'm aware of the way I'm acting and how it affects the situation. That's it. And you're
[02:09:10] having to be pretty affected. I'm in a positive way though. How you turn it up? Like if it's for the
[02:09:15] goal of the collective. Right. Right. It's not a, not a, to my level. Yes. It is not. All right. So
[02:09:23] really the answer to the question is not really. That's the question. I like the way you put that.
[02:09:30] All right. We got one more. Yeah. It's the good time for one more.
[02:09:36] Jockel. How do you stay motivated and how do you motivate people when they start to slack?
[02:09:46] Now motivation is kind of a strange word because it doesn't really mean what we think it means.
[02:09:56] We think it means that we're fired up to do something. We think that it means we're eager
[02:10:06] and passionate to make something happen. And we think that somehow we should just be able to
[02:10:15] turn on that eagerness and turn on that passion. But we can't. Because you just can't turn on passion.
[02:10:30] You can't just turn on the desire to execute a task. It just doesn't work that way. And honestly,
[02:10:41] that isn't even what motivate means. Motivate doesn't mean to yell and scream and encourage.
[02:10:54] No, to motivate actually means to provide a motive. A reason why.
[02:11:01] So to motivate someone is to explain to them why they're doing what they're doing. How it will help them.
[02:11:14] Where it'll take them. Why they should continue to work and to struggle and to fight.
[02:11:23] And when you need motivation yourself, look for someone to scream and yell.
[02:11:29] No, look for someone else to give you motivation. Look at yourself.
[02:11:40] Look at yourself and remind yourself why. Why you are doing what you are doing. Remind yourself
[02:11:53] that this struggle, this temporary pain, this fight that you're in, this is what will make you stronger
[02:12:05] and faster and smarter and better. And then with that motivation go forward
[02:12:22] into the frail, into the storm, into the heat of the battle.
[02:12:36] Where victory is forged.
[02:12:40] And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So thanks to everyone for listening and supporting.

[02:14:37] Let's be in a joclist door. Before you shop on Amazon, if you go to joclistdoor, you can shop on
[02:14:43] joclistdoor. If you like the shirt, we have shirts. We have a new one out too. But yeah, if you think
[02:14:49] those are cool shirts, the new one out's know the darkness. See, no one's even going to know what
[02:14:54] these things mean. Unless you're one of us, right? You're not going to know people is going to be
[02:14:59] asking me what are you doing? Why you wearing that? I can barely read it. You said they weren't about it.
[02:15:03] Yeah, and I'll say this where I don't know if I told you this before, but
[02:15:08] the ideas behind the shirts, they're not just random. That looks cool on a shirt or whatever,
[02:15:16] they do have inside meaning, discipline equals freedom. That was your thing originally before you
[02:15:22] started podcast. When you said that, I was like, that doesn't make any sense. And that's what you said.
[02:15:27] You said at first, it doesn't make any sense. And I was like, yeah, it doesn't make thinking in my head.
[02:15:30] But then when you explain, it was like, dang, that's kind of, that's deep. It does make sense.
[02:15:36] Yeah, it does make sense. It makes perfect sense. Actually, but it is one of those things. You know,
[02:15:41] that's kind of where's so, okay. So that makes sense. If you don't know what it means, all it is is
[02:15:45] yet another shirt with a little saying on it, that's all it is. If you don't know what it means,
[02:15:49] same thing with your head that says good and good is backwards. All these shirts are for you. They're
[02:15:57] not for like, hey, everyone look at my cool shirt even though they can have that effect. But that's not
[02:16:02] what even their thing for you, cool. Yeah. So when you're looking in the mirror, it says good,
[02:16:07] then you can see you can read it. It's backwards. So the darkness shirt, if you look at it's black on
[02:16:13] a black shirt, barely see it. But that's what darkness is, man. You can barely see it, but you know
[02:16:18] that that darkness. Look at the design on the mouth. Yeah, if you look at the design on the back,
[02:16:23] it's a, we'll just say it's a dark scene. I'm just going to say that, but it's black on black. So you
[02:16:27] can, unless you kind of know and you really look at it, you know, if the shirt means something
[02:16:32] to you, you know, when it's going to be. So you're making shirts that actually, you got to be one of us.
[02:16:37] Yeah, you got to be on the inside, you know, you have that extra layer. What's up? But him and if you
[02:16:43] just think it just looks cool. Hey, do you know what? There you go. That's where to if you want.
[02:16:49] Awesome. So that's everyone that makes the podcast happen and the actual people that make the podcast
[02:16:57] happen is you all listening to this podcast, you're the ones that make it happen that asks the
