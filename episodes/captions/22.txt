00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.80 This is Jocco podcast number 22 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willick.
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:11.04 Good evening, I go.
00:00:11.04 --> 00:00:14.76 Good evening.
00:00:14.76 --> 00:00:18.16 And I would say that it is a good evening.
00:00:18.16 --> 00:00:24.88 Because we are free.
00:00:24.88 --> 00:00:29.12 We are free.
00:00:29.12 --> 00:00:34.66 And I talk about that all the time.
00:00:34.66 --> 00:00:36.38 You hear me say discipline equals freedom.
00:00:36.38 --> 00:00:40.80 You hear me say free your mind.
00:00:40.80 --> 00:00:46.88 And here in America and in places around the world that have the ability to be listening to
00:00:46.88 --> 00:00:49.20 this podcast.
00:00:49.20 --> 00:00:58.36 A lot of times we take freedom for granted.
00:00:58.36 --> 00:01:00.24 And we all want freedom.
00:01:00.24 --> 00:01:07.92 We want the ability to move around and go where we want to go.
00:01:07.92 --> 00:01:16.76 But more importantly, we want freedom of the mind and freedom of the heart.
00:01:16.76 --> 00:01:21.04 And those things sound abstract.
00:01:21.04 --> 00:01:24.88 They seem like things that cannot be taken away.
00:01:24.88 --> 00:01:29.44 We don't even know what that means to have them taken away.
00:01:29.44 --> 00:01:35.04 Because of the way we live and how we were raised.
00:01:35.04 --> 00:01:43.04 To think what you want to think and believe what you want to believe.
00:01:43.04 --> 00:01:48.28 To be who you want to be.
00:01:48.28 --> 00:01:55.92 To have and to exercise the freedom to question.
00:01:55.92 --> 00:02:01.08 To question everything.
00:02:01.08 --> 00:02:07.12 That's freedom.
00:02:07.12 --> 00:02:18.24 And there are parts of the world where none of those freedoms exist.
00:02:18.24 --> 00:02:27.72 In worse, there's parts of the world where any chance of free thought is exterminated
00:02:27.72 --> 00:02:32.80 from childhood.
00:02:32.80 --> 00:02:44.52 Will, broken, dreams extinguished.
00:02:44.52 --> 00:02:53.60 That's controlled.
00:02:53.60 --> 00:03:03.44 So let's go to a place where that is the reality.
00:03:03.44 --> 00:03:05.72 And again, I'm going to point this out.
00:03:05.72 --> 00:03:12.48 This is not a dystopian movie or some post-apocalyptic novel.
00:03:12.48 --> 00:03:13.48 This is real.
00:03:13.48 --> 00:03:27.56 Real life with real people.
00:03:27.56 --> 00:03:34.60 Red is reserved for the lettering of the propaganda signs.
00:03:34.60 --> 00:03:41.68 The Korean language uses a unique alphabet made up of circles and lines.
00:03:41.68 --> 00:03:47.56 The red letters leap out of the grey landscape with urgency.
00:03:47.56 --> 00:03:53.40 They march across the fields, preside over the granite cliffs of the mountains, punctuate
00:03:53.40 --> 00:03:59.68 the main roads like my-litch markers, and dance on top of railroad stations and other public
00:03:59.68 --> 00:04:05.52 buildings.
00:04:05.52 --> 00:04:08.88 They say things like this.
00:04:08.88 --> 00:04:14.64 We have nothing to envy in the world.
00:04:14.64 --> 00:04:21.000 If the party decides we do.
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.56 Long live Kim Il-sung.
00:04:26.56 --> 00:04:31.88 Let's live our own way.
00:04:31.88 --> 00:04:40.36 We will do as the party tells us.
00:04:40.36 --> 00:04:47.20 We will do as the party tells us.
00:04:47.20 --> 00:04:52.28 And like I said, this isn't a book.
00:04:52.28 --> 00:04:54.68 This is real.
00:04:54.68 --> 00:04:56.88 This is North Korea.
00:04:56.88 --> 00:05:05.24 This is a story of horror and of slavery and of brainwashing.
00:05:05.24 --> 00:05:11.60 And it's also a story of choices.
00:05:11.60 --> 00:05:13.28 Story of freedom.
00:05:13.28 --> 00:05:20.32 And it's also a story of the strength of the human will.
00:05:20.32 --> 00:05:25.44 This is a book that is called Nothing to envy.
00:05:25.44 --> 00:05:29.44 It's a story of the ordinary lives in North Korea.
00:05:29.44 --> 00:05:44.68 It's by Barbara Demick or Demick.
00:05:44.68 --> 00:05:51.52 It traces a bunch of people that defected who Barbara Demick was able to interview once
00:05:51.52 --> 00:05:54.08 they left North Korea.
00:05:54.08 --> 00:06:00.08 But it traces their lives and what their lives were like.
00:06:00.08 --> 00:06:04.24 And one of the characters, and again, I want to call the character one of the people.
00:06:04.24 --> 00:06:05.24 That's in the book.
00:06:05.24 --> 00:06:07.08 His name, Miran.
00:06:07.08 --> 00:06:11.28 And going to the book here, Miran's father was a POW.
00:06:11.28 --> 00:06:16.32 And it talks about that Miran's father never talked about being a POW.
00:06:16.32 --> 00:06:21.08 But there is another fellow POW who wrote a memoir.
00:06:21.08 --> 00:06:26.48 And in his memoir, and I'm going to the book here, he said that men were housed in
00:06:26.48 --> 00:06:32.04 squalid camps where they were not permitted to bathe or brush their teeth.
00:06:32.04 --> 00:06:37.56 Their hair became infested with ice untreated wounds swarmed with maggots.
00:06:37.56 --> 00:06:44.20 They were fed one meal of rice and salt water a day.
00:06:44.20 --> 00:06:50.84 Under the name, construction unit of the interior department, new POW camps had been built
00:06:50.84 --> 00:06:53.12 near the mines.
00:06:53.12 --> 00:06:59.88 Colmining in North Korea was not only dirty but exceedingly dangerous, since the mines frequently
00:06:59.88 --> 00:07:03.84 collapsed or caught fire.
00:07:03.84 --> 00:07:11.96 And that same former POW wrote, the life of a POW was worth less than a fly.
00:07:11.96 --> 00:07:17.28 Every day we walked into the mines I shuddered with fear.
00:07:17.28 --> 00:07:29.36 Like a cow walking to the slaughterhouse, I never knew if I would emerge alive.
00:07:29.36 --> 00:07:37.32 So if you don't know anything about anything, the leader in North Korea at this time,
00:07:37.32 --> 00:07:47.44 the most opposed war is Kim Il Sung.
00:07:47.44 --> 00:07:52.20 Is in charge of North Korea.
00:07:52.20 --> 00:07:54.92 But at this time, I'm going to the book.
00:07:54.92 --> 00:08:01.64 After the war, Kim Il Sung made his first order of business to weed out foe from friend.
00:08:01.64 --> 00:08:04.88 He started at the top with potential rivals for leadership.
00:08:04.88 --> 00:08:10.04 He disposed of many of his comrades and arms who had led the struggle from Manchuria
00:08:10.04 --> 00:08:13.72 to unseat the Japanese occupiers.
00:08:13.72 --> 00:08:18.40 He ordered the arrest of the founding members of the Communist Party in South Korea.
00:08:18.40 --> 00:08:23.24 They had been invaluable during the war, now that they'd served their purpose, they could
00:08:23.24 --> 00:08:25.40 be discarded.
00:08:25.40 --> 00:08:30.20 Throughout the 1950s, many more were purged and what was increasingly coming to resemble
00:08:30.20 --> 00:08:38.84 an ancient Chinese empire with Kim Il Sung, the unchallenged master of the realm.
00:08:38.84 --> 00:08:45.16 Kim Il Sung then turned his attention to ordinary people.
00:08:45.16 --> 00:08:51.12 In 1958, he ordered up an elaborate project to classify all North Koreans by their political
00:08:51.12 --> 00:08:58.76 reliability and viciously seeking to reorganize an entire human population.
00:08:58.76 --> 00:09:02.48 The North Koreans were methodical to a fault.
00:09:02.48 --> 00:09:06.20 Each person was put through eight background checks.
00:09:06.20 --> 00:09:12.36 Your song, Bun, as the rating was called, took into account the backgrounds of your parents,
00:09:12.36 --> 00:09:16.04 grandparents, and even second cousins.
00:09:16.04 --> 00:09:22.36 The loyalty surveys were carried out in various phases with inspiring names.
00:09:22.36 --> 00:09:27.44 Intensive guidance by the Central Party was the first announced phase.
00:09:27.44 --> 00:09:34.08 The classifications became more refined in subsequent phases, such as the understanding
00:09:34.08 --> 00:09:41.76 people project between 1972 and 1974.
00:09:41.76 --> 00:09:50.76 Those things to me, they all sound like just bad movie plots.
00:09:50.76 --> 00:10:03.48 The intensive guidance by the Central Party, that's something you don't want to mess with.
00:10:03.48 --> 00:10:05.52 Here's how they would be.
00:10:05.52 --> 00:10:07.80 Here's what life was like.
00:10:07.80 --> 00:10:08.80 A little bit of life.
00:10:08.80 --> 00:10:12.04 People would be closely watched by their neighbors.
00:10:12.04 --> 00:10:16.48 North Koreans are organized into what are called in Minbong.
00:10:16.48 --> 00:10:18.92 Literally, people's groups.
00:10:18.92 --> 00:10:24.48 The cooperatives of 20 or so families whose job it is to keep tabs on one another and
00:10:24.48 --> 00:10:25.96 run the neighborhood.
00:10:25.96 --> 00:10:32.16 The Inminbong have an elected leader, usually a middle-aged woman who reports anything suspicious
00:10:32.16 --> 00:10:34.76 to higher ranking authorities.
00:10:34.76 --> 00:10:44.76 It was almost impossible for a North Korean of low rank to improve his status.
00:10:44.76 --> 00:10:51.28 Now we talked about this character or sorry, the person, Miran, that's being talked about.
00:10:51.28 --> 00:10:56.20 And she talks about her father.
00:10:56.20 --> 00:10:58.16 Here's what she says about her father.
00:10:58.16 --> 00:11:03.04 Miran often found her father's Pacifici maddening.
00:11:03.04 --> 00:11:08.04 Only later did she understand this was a survival mechanism.
00:11:08.04 --> 00:11:13.88 It was as though he had hammered down his own personality to avoid drawing undue attention
00:11:13.88 --> 00:11:16.28 to himself.
00:11:16.28 --> 00:11:21.36 Among the thousands of former South Korean soldiers who tried to assimilate into North Korean
00:11:21.36 --> 00:11:23.96 society, many slipped up.
00:11:23.96 --> 00:11:30.12 Miran's mother later told her that four of her father's buddies in the mines, fellow
00:11:30.12 --> 00:11:34.80 South Koreans, had been executed for minor infractions.
00:11:34.80 --> 00:11:38.12 Their bodies dumped in mass graves.
00:11:38.12 --> 00:11:43.40 Being a member of the hostile class meant you would never get the benefit of a doubt.
00:11:43.40 --> 00:11:48.72 While sarcastic inflection when referring to Kim Il-sung or an astrologer remark about South
00:11:48.72 --> 00:11:55.28 Korea could get you in serious trouble, it was especially taboo to talk about the Korean war
00:11:55.28 --> 00:11:57.88 and who started it.
00:11:57.88 --> 00:12:04.56 In the official histories, and there was nothing but official history in North Korea, it was
00:12:04.56 --> 00:12:10.56 the South Korean army that invaded, acting on orders from the Americans.
00:12:10.56 --> 00:12:15.52 Not the North Korean army storming across the 38th parallel.
00:12:15.52 --> 00:12:21.72 Anybody who remembered what really happened on June 25th, 1950 knew it was wise to keep
00:12:21.72 --> 00:12:25.44 one's mouth shut.
00:12:25.44 --> 00:12:30.000 So even history.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.20 Even facts that you learned that the country learned were just lies.
00:12:38.20 --> 00:12:44.000 New Rand didn't have any particular artistic or athletic talent, but like her older sisters
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.44 did, but she was a good student and she was beautiful.
00:12:48.44 --> 00:12:52.92 When she was 15 years old, her school was visited by a team of serious looking men and
00:12:52.92 --> 00:12:55.52 women in somber suits.
00:12:55.52 --> 00:13:01.80 These were aqua members of the fifth division of the Central Workers' Party, recruiter
00:13:01.80 --> 00:13:07.92 recruiters who scoured the country looking for young women to serve on the personal staff
00:13:07.92 --> 00:13:11.92 of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.
00:13:11.92 --> 00:13:17.04 If selected, the girls would be sent off to military-style training camp before being
00:13:17.04 --> 00:13:23.60 assigned to one of the leadership's many residences around the country.
00:13:23.60 --> 00:13:28.60 North Korean girls her age didn't know what a conq vine was.
00:13:28.60 --> 00:13:35.96 Only that whatever you might do to serve the leadership would be a tremendous honor.
00:13:35.96 --> 00:13:44.88 If the smartest and prettiest girls would be selected, I think we can all imagine what
00:13:44.88 --> 00:14:02.40 that looks like twisted men in seats of power, praying on the entire nations for young girls
00:14:02.40 --> 00:14:04.24 disturbing.
00:14:04.24 --> 00:14:11.08 Now another character in the book, and I keep using that term character, you hear that?
00:14:11.08 --> 00:14:14.80 Even me, I'm sitting here trying to tell everyone, hey, remember these are people, but
00:14:14.80 --> 00:14:15.96 I'm calling them characters.
00:14:15.96 --> 00:14:20.72 These aren't characters in the book, these are people.
00:14:20.72 --> 00:14:28.92 And this person was named Mrs. Song and Mrs. Song, what's interesting about Mrs. Song is,
00:14:28.92 --> 00:14:30.92 she's a true believer.
00:14:30.92 --> 00:14:34.84 She's a true believer, and you're going to hear some of this, but these folks that are
00:14:34.84 --> 00:14:40.32 raised in North Korea, they just believe that they believe the propaganda, they believe
00:14:40.32 --> 00:14:46.20 that North Korea's the best place on earth and that everyone else is suffering and that
00:14:46.20 --> 00:14:51.84 because of their great leader, their lives are better than anyone else in the world.
00:14:51.84 --> 00:14:54.12 And she truly believes that.
00:14:54.12 --> 00:14:55.60 And here's kind of what her attitude.
00:14:55.60 --> 00:14:58.76 Here's what her life was like and her attitude was like.
00:14:58.76 --> 00:15:03.52 Mrs. Song usually went to work with one baby strap to her back and one or two daughters
00:15:03.52 --> 00:15:05.56 dragging along behind her.
00:15:05.56 --> 00:15:08.32 Her children basically grew up at the daycare center.
00:15:08.32 --> 00:15:13.000 She was supposed to work eight hours with a lunch break and a nap in the middle of her shift.
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.92 After work, she had to spend several more hours in ideological training in the factories
00:15:18.92 --> 00:15:20.72 auditorium.
00:15:20.72 --> 00:15:24.76 One day, the lecture might be about the struggle against US imperialism.
00:15:24.76 --> 00:15:30.24 On other time, it might be about Kim Il-Sung's exploits, actual or exaggerating, fighting
00:15:30.24 --> 00:15:33.000 the Japanese during World War II.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.92 She had to write essays on the latest pronouncements of the Workers' Party.
00:15:37.92 --> 00:15:41.68 By the time she got home, it would be 1030 p.m.
00:15:41.68 --> 00:15:45.84 She would do her housework and cooking, then get up before dawn to prepare herself and
00:15:45.84 --> 00:15:49.92 her family for the day ahead before leaving home around 7 a.m.
00:15:49.92 --> 00:15:52.96 She seldom slept more than five hours.
00:15:52.96 --> 00:15:54.80 Some days were harder than others.
00:15:54.80 --> 00:15:58.64 On Wednesday mornings, she had to report to work early for mandatory meetings of the
00:15:58.64 --> 00:16:01.52 socialist women's federation.
00:16:01.52 --> 00:16:05.84 Friday night, she stayed especially late for self-criticism.
00:16:05.84 --> 00:16:10.56 In these sessions, members of her work unit, the department to which she was assigned,
00:16:10.56 --> 00:16:14.88 would stand up and reveal to the group anything they had done wrong.
00:16:14.88 --> 00:16:21.72 Mrs. Song would usually say, in all sincerity, sincerity, that she feared she wasn't working
00:16:21.72 --> 00:16:24.60 hard enough.
00:16:24.60 --> 00:16:27.52 Mrs. Song believed what she said.
00:16:27.52 --> 00:16:32.68 All those years of sleep deprivation, all those lectures and self-criticisms, the very
00:16:32.68 --> 00:16:40.76 same tools used in brainwashing or interrogations had wiped out any possibility of resistance.
00:16:40.76 --> 00:16:49.56 She had been molded into Kim Il-Sung's improved human beings.
00:16:49.56 --> 00:16:56.56 While Song's goal wasn't merely to build a new country, he wanted to build better people
00:16:56.56 --> 00:17:02.44 to reshape human nature.
00:17:02.44 --> 00:17:09.96 Once in power, Kim Il-Sung retooled the ideas developed during his time as an anti-Japanese
00:17:09.96 --> 00:17:17.80 guerrilla fighter, as instruments into instruments of social control.
00:17:17.80 --> 00:17:23.56 He instructed North Koreans that their power as human beings came from subsuming their
00:17:23.56 --> 00:17:29.16 individual will to that of the collective.
00:17:29.16 --> 00:17:32.80 The collective couldn't go off willy, nearly doing whatever the people chose through
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:35.84 some democratic process.
00:17:35.84 --> 00:17:42.96 The people had to follow an absolute supreme leader without question.
00:17:42.96 --> 00:17:52.20 That leader of course was Kim Il-Sung himself.
00:17:52.20 --> 00:18:02.88 So they're being told through multiple channels, through every instrument available newspapers,
00:18:02.88 --> 00:18:06.72 radio, television, all controlled by the state.
00:18:06.72 --> 00:18:13.72 And through all these, they're being told that they have to submit their individual will
00:18:13.72 --> 00:18:21.72 and perform at the will of the collective.
00:18:21.72 --> 00:18:33.92 And you know, you will hear me refer to, for me, the most important piece of humanity
00:18:33.92 --> 00:18:39.72 is the individual, an individual freedom.
00:18:39.72 --> 00:18:47.44 And obviously this attitude is the opposite of individual freedom.
00:18:47.44 --> 00:18:54.92 And also you got to remember from a leadership perspective, the way you maximize a team's
00:18:54.92 --> 00:18:59.84 effort isn't through a supreme authority trying to control everything.
00:18:59.84 --> 00:19:01.68 It doesn't work.
00:19:01.68 --> 00:19:05.28 That's why we have a little something called decentralized command.
00:19:05.28 --> 00:19:07.68 I want my frontline leaders to think.
00:19:07.68 --> 00:19:12.48 I want my frontline troops to understand what they're trying to make happen and use their
00:19:12.48 --> 00:19:16.16 free will to make it happen, use their own brain to make it happen.
00:19:16.16 --> 00:19:20.40 So if you're in a leadership position and you realize that you're trying to control everything
00:19:20.40 --> 00:19:27.64 yourself, you're not getting the most effective performance from your team.
00:19:27.64 --> 00:19:30.44 And we're going to see this on a grand scale.
00:19:30.44 --> 00:19:37.08 And you know, we do see it on the grand scale when governments try to control humans.
00:19:37.08 --> 00:19:42.76 It doesn't work.
00:19:42.76 --> 00:19:48.56 Now it might seem crazy that you would buy into this propaganda.
00:19:48.56 --> 00:19:54.28 And here's a paragraph in the statement about that, back to the book.
00:19:54.28 --> 00:20:00.000 We laugh at the excesses of propaganda and the gollability of the people.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.52 So consider that their indoctrination began in their infancy.
00:20:05.52 --> 00:20:10.24 During 14 hour days spent in factory daycare centers.
00:20:10.24 --> 00:20:16.80 That for the subsequent 50 years every song, film, newspaper article and billboard was
00:20:16.80 --> 00:20:22.12 helped was designed to deify Kim Il Sung.
00:20:22.12 --> 00:20:27.64 That the country was hermetically sealed to keep out anything that might might cast doubt
00:20:27.64 --> 00:20:31.72 on Kim Il Sung's divinity.
00:20:31.72 --> 00:20:33.96 Who could possibly resist?
00:20:33.96 --> 00:20:43.24 Are you not just being told that this guy is the leader you've been told he's God.
00:20:43.24 --> 00:20:49.72 In 1972 on the occasion of his 60th birthday, a traditional milestone in Korean culture,
00:20:49.72 --> 00:20:54.76 the workers party began distributing lapel pins of Kim Il Sung.
00:20:54.76 --> 00:20:59.68 More along the entire population was required to wear them on the left breast over the
00:20:59.68 --> 00:21:01.40 heart.
00:21:01.40 --> 00:21:08.40 In Mrs. Sung's home, as in every other, a framed portrait of Kim Il Sung hung on an otherwise
00:21:08.40 --> 00:21:11.32 bare wall.
00:21:11.32 --> 00:21:16.64 People were not permitted to put anything else on that wall, not even pictures of their blood
00:21:16.64 --> 00:21:20.44 relatives.
00:21:20.44 --> 00:21:26.80 The children were never to forget that they owed everything to the national leadership.
00:21:26.80 --> 00:21:31.36 North Korean children, they didn't celebrate their own birthdays, but those of Kim Il Sung
00:21:31.36 --> 00:21:38.68 on April 15th and Kim Jong Il on February 16th.
00:21:38.68 --> 00:21:44.84 When the time came, the children lined up in front of the portraits to express their gratitude.
00:21:44.84 --> 00:21:50.72 In Unison, they would bend from the waist, bowing deeply with feeling.
00:21:50.72 --> 00:22:01.32 Thank you dear father Kim Il Sung, the children repeated as their mother looked on with satisfaction.
00:22:01.32 --> 00:22:07.84 Televisions and radios in North Korea are preset, so they can receive only official government
00:22:07.84 --> 00:22:09.56 channels.
00:22:09.56 --> 00:22:13.36 Still, the programming was relatively entertaining.
00:22:13.36 --> 00:22:18.40 Besides the usual speeches of Kim Il Sung, on a typical weeknight, you might have sports,
00:22:18.40 --> 00:22:25.44 concerts, television dramas, and movies produced by Kim Il, Kim Jong Il's film studio.
00:22:25.44 --> 00:22:30.60 On weekends, you might get a Russian movie as a special treat.
00:22:30.60 --> 00:22:36.32 The newspapers would occasionally run feature stories about heroic children who ratted
00:22:36.32 --> 00:22:38.80 out their parents.
00:22:38.80 --> 00:22:45.80 To be denounced by a neighbor for bowed mathing, the regime was nothing extraordinary.
00:22:45.80 --> 00:22:53.92 I'm starting to get a little feeling for what we've got going on here.
00:22:53.92 --> 00:22:59.72 Now what happens when the government tries to control everything and you take the freedom
00:22:59.72 --> 00:23:08.76 of the people away, communism, obviously, and things are not as productive as
00:23:08.76 --> 00:23:10.52 they could be.
00:23:10.52 --> 00:23:17.000 That's what happens when there's no individual drive to succeed because if you're a farmer,
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.24 once you plant your food, it's just going to get taken away by the government and redistributed.
00:23:23.24 --> 00:23:27.52 So what's your drive to grow the right amount of food or more food?
00:23:27.52 --> 00:23:30.52 There is none, because it's all just going to be taken away anyways.
00:23:30.52 --> 00:23:36.40 It's like they're all they avoid punishment, so they do the minimum, you know, rather
00:23:36.40 --> 00:23:41.08 than the opposite, when they strive for the maximum, that means they're focused on what
00:23:41.08 --> 00:23:44.32 can be, you know, rather than avoiding what can be.
00:23:44.32 --> 00:23:45.68 Yes.
00:23:45.68 --> 00:23:54.76 And so now this is again, I'm breezing through chunks of this book to get to some of the highlights.
00:23:54.76 --> 00:24:07.96 So now we're into the 80s and we're starting to run out of food.
00:24:07.96 --> 00:24:14.12 Kim Jong-il, who by the 1980s was increasingly assuming his father's duties offered
00:24:14.12 --> 00:24:20.80 on the spot guidance to address the country's woes, father and son were experts in absolutely
00:24:20.80 --> 00:24:24.56 everything, be it geology or farming.
00:24:24.56 --> 00:24:30.72 Kim Jong-il's onsite instructions and his warm benevolence are bringing about a great
00:24:30.72 --> 00:24:35.76 advance in goat breeding and output of dairy products.
00:24:35.76 --> 00:24:41.76 The Korean Central News Agency, Opine, after Kim Jong-il visited a goat farm near Chong
00:24:41.76 --> 00:24:42.76 Ginn.
00:24:42.76 --> 00:24:48.08 So that's the kind of headlines in the news.
00:24:48.08 --> 00:24:52.04 One day he would decree that the country sits switch from rice to potatoes for its staple
00:24:52.04 --> 00:24:57.20 food, the next he would decide that raising ostriches was the cure for North Korea's food
00:24:57.20 --> 00:24:59.52 surdaged shortage.
00:24:59.52 --> 00:25:06.12 The country lurched from one hair-brained scheme to another.
00:25:06.12 --> 00:25:11.80 So the fact of the matter is that even if this guy was a brilliant oasis brilliant farmer,
00:25:11.80 --> 00:25:15.96 he's not taking into account the various terrain and the different climates that are in
00:25:15.96 --> 00:25:18.64 the area and who can get what done.
00:25:18.64 --> 00:25:24.24 Whereas if you let the free market decide what can be grown and let individuals decide
00:25:24.24 --> 00:25:35.84 and let freedom guide people, things work, things find a way.
00:25:35.84 --> 00:25:45.68 The control does not work and you'll see that here back to the book.
00:25:45.68 --> 00:25:49.56 Soon the country was sucked into a vicious death spiral.
00:25:49.56 --> 00:25:55.60 Without cheap fuel oil and raw material, it couldn't keep the factories running, which meant
00:25:55.60 --> 00:25:57.84 it had nothing to export.
00:25:57.84 --> 00:26:03.84 With no exports, there was no hard currency and without hard currency, fuel imports fell
00:26:03.84 --> 00:26:06.16 even further.
00:26:06.16 --> 00:26:09.60 And the electricity stopped.
00:26:09.60 --> 00:26:13.84 The coal mines couldn't operate without electricity because they required electric pumps
00:26:13.84 --> 00:26:15.96 to siphon water.
00:26:15.96 --> 00:26:20.08 The shortage of coal worsened the electricity shortage.
00:26:20.08 --> 00:26:24.40 The electricity shortage further lowered agricultural output.
00:26:24.40 --> 00:26:29.32 Even the collective farms could not operate properly without electricity.
00:26:29.32 --> 00:26:34.56 It had never been easy to e-gout enough harvest from North Korea's hard-scravel terrain
00:26:34.56 --> 00:26:39.92 for a population of 23 million and the agricultural techniques developed to boost the output
00:26:39.92 --> 00:26:45.28 relied on electrically powered artificial irrigation systems and on chemical fertilizers
00:26:45.28 --> 00:26:53.92 and pesticides produced it factories that were now closed for lack of fuel and raw materials.
00:26:53.92 --> 00:26:58.72 North Korea started running out of food and as people went hungry, they didn't have the energy
00:26:58.72 --> 00:27:02.20 to work and so output plunged further.
00:27:02.20 --> 00:27:06.24 The economy was in a free fall.
00:27:06.24 --> 00:27:11.96 North Korea was the last play on earth where virtually all staples are grown on collective
00:27:11.96 --> 00:27:13.36 farms.
00:27:13.36 --> 00:27:18.76 The state confiscates the entire harvest and then gives a portion back to the farmer.
00:27:18.76 --> 00:27:24.000 But as harvest whithered in the early 1990s, the farmers themselves were going hungry
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.40 and began stashing some of the harvest away.
00:27:27.40 --> 00:27:32.04 There were stories from the countryside of roofs that collapsed under the weight of grain
00:27:32.04 --> 00:27:34.48 hidden away in the eaves.
00:27:34.48 --> 00:27:40.60 The farmers also neglected the collective fields for their private kitchen gardens next
00:27:40.60 --> 00:27:46.48 to their houses or small steep plots that carved out of the side of uncultivated mountain
00:27:46.48 --> 00:27:48.72 slopes.
00:27:48.72 --> 00:27:53.92 Driving through the countryside, you could see clearly the contrast between private gardens
00:27:53.92 --> 00:27:59.80 bursting with vegetables, bean poles, soaring skyward, vines drooping with pumpkins next
00:27:59.80 --> 00:28:06.44 to the collective fields with their stunted haphazard rows of corn that had been planted
00:28:06.44 --> 00:28:13.32 by so-called volunteers doing their patriotic duty.
00:28:13.32 --> 00:28:18.68 Case in point.
00:28:18.68 --> 00:28:23.52 Koreans like to think to themselves as tough and so they are.
00:28:23.52 --> 00:28:28.84 The propaganda machine launched a new campaign, playing up Korean pride by recalling
00:28:28.84 --> 00:28:36.60 a fable from 1938 to 1939 in which Kim Il Sung commanded a small band of anti-Japanese guerrillas
00:28:36.60 --> 00:28:42.32 fighting against thousands of enemies in 20 degrees below zero, braving through a heavy snowfall
00:28:42.32 --> 00:28:47.40 and starvation, the red flag fluttering in front of the rank.
00:28:47.40 --> 00:28:58.40 The arduous march, as they called it, would later become a metaphor for the famine.
00:28:58.40 --> 00:29:03.64 And here's one of the statements that they would make no force on earth can bar the
00:29:03.64 --> 00:29:09.64 Korean people from making an onward march for victory and the revolutionary spirit of the
00:29:09.64 --> 00:29:13.60 arduous march.
00:29:13.60 --> 00:29:20.68 And the D.P.R.K. will always remain a powerful nation.
00:29:20.68 --> 00:29:25.68 Democratic people's Republic of Korea.
00:29:25.68 --> 00:29:32.36 Also people are starving.
00:29:32.36 --> 00:29:35.52 And the government is saying, yeah, we're going to drive on.
00:29:35.52 --> 00:29:39.28 It's a tough road, but we're going to make it.
00:29:39.28 --> 00:29:43.20 And during hunger became part of one's patriotic duty.
00:29:43.20 --> 00:29:51.20 Billboards went up in Pyongyang, touting the new slogan, let's eat two meals a day.
00:29:51.20 --> 00:29:55.20 North Korean television ran a documentary about a man who's stomach burst.
00:29:55.20 --> 00:29:59.68 It was claimed from eating too much rice.
00:29:59.68 --> 00:30:03.16 In any case, the food shortage was temporary.
00:30:03.16 --> 00:30:08.20 Agricultural officials, quoted in the newspapers, reported that bumper crops of rice
00:30:08.20 --> 00:30:11.76 were expected in the next harvest.
00:30:11.76 --> 00:30:18.88 When the foreign press reported on food shortages in the north in 1992, the North Korean
00:30:18.88 --> 00:30:22.48 news service was indignant.
00:30:22.48 --> 00:30:25.48 And here's what the North Korean news service had to say.
00:30:25.48 --> 00:30:31.32 The state supplies the people with food at a cheap price so that the people do not know
00:30:31.32 --> 00:30:33.52 how much rice costs.
00:30:33.52 --> 00:30:37.12 This is the reality of the northern half of Korea.
00:30:37.12 --> 00:30:44.52 All people live a happy life without any worries about food in our land.
00:30:44.52 --> 00:30:49.88 People are starving and the government is lying.
00:30:49.88 --> 00:30:54.88 If North Koreans pause to contemplate the obvious inconsistencies and lies in what they
00:30:54.88 --> 00:30:58.84 were told, they would find themselves in a dangerous place.
00:30:58.84 --> 00:31:01.08 They didn't have a choice.
00:31:01.08 --> 00:31:07.04 They couldn't flee their country, depose of their leadership, speak out or protest.
00:31:07.04 --> 00:31:16.72 In order to fit in, the average citizen had to discipline himself not to think too much.
00:31:16.72 --> 00:31:23.04 Then there was the natural human survival instinct to be optimistic.
00:31:23.04 --> 00:31:27.56 Like German Jews in the early 1930s who told themselves it couldn't get any worse, the
00:31:27.56 --> 00:31:29.56 North Koreans deceive themselves.
00:31:29.56 --> 00:31:32.08 They thought it was temporary.
00:31:32.08 --> 00:31:33.88 Things would get better.
00:31:33.88 --> 00:31:40.48 The hungry stomach shouldn't believe a lie, but somehow it did.
00:31:40.48 --> 00:31:45.08 Along with the new propaganda campaign, the regime stepped up at extensive network of
00:31:45.08 --> 00:31:47.80 domestic surveillance.
00:31:47.80 --> 00:32:02.32 The more there was to complain about the more important it was to ensure that nobody did.
00:32:02.32 --> 00:32:10.96 Now, at this point further in the book, Miran has gone off the college to become a teacher.
00:32:10.96 --> 00:32:14.80 And she shows up there.
00:32:14.80 --> 00:32:16.56 And this is what she deals with.
00:32:16.56 --> 00:32:20.24 The food in the cafeteria was even worse.
00:32:20.24 --> 00:32:21.64 North Korea was starting.
00:32:21.64 --> 00:32:25.08 It's, let's eat two meals a day campaign.
00:32:25.08 --> 00:32:29.28 But the school took a step further and offered only one meal.
00:32:29.28 --> 00:32:34.96 The thin soup made of salt, water, and dried turn-up leaves.
00:32:34.96 --> 00:32:40.84 The cafeteria would sometimes add a spoon of rice and corn that had been cooked for hours
00:32:40.84 --> 00:32:44.40 to pump up the grains.
00:32:44.40 --> 00:32:48.32 The girls and college began getting sick.
00:32:48.32 --> 00:32:55.36 One of Miran's roommates was so malnourished that the skin was flaking off of her face.
00:32:55.36 --> 00:33:07.68 She dropped out of school and others followed.
00:33:07.68 --> 00:33:21.32 Now during the, during the middle of this, Kim Il-sung dies.
00:33:21.32 --> 00:33:28.76 And it's crazy to hear how the people reacted.
00:33:28.76 --> 00:33:33.80 And so I'm going to start off with this announcement that was made.
00:33:33.80 --> 00:33:38.32 And this is long, a little bit of a long announcement.
00:33:38.32 --> 00:33:42.08 But just to get the tone of it is worth it.
00:33:42.08 --> 00:33:43.08 Here we go.
00:33:43.08 --> 00:33:47.08 The central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the central military commission
00:33:47.08 --> 00:33:51.84 of the party, the National Defense Commission, the Central People's Committee, and the
00:33:51.84 --> 00:33:56.68 administration council of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, report to the entire
00:33:56.68 --> 00:34:03.16 people of the country with deepest grief that the great leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung, General
00:34:03.16 --> 00:34:11.84 Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and President of the Democratic
00:34:11.84 --> 00:34:18.80 People's Republic of Korea passed away from a sudden attack of Il-nus at 2am.
00:34:18.80 --> 00:34:26.24 Our respected fatherly leader, who has devoted his whole life to the popular masses, calls
00:34:26.24 --> 00:34:33.20 of independence and engaged himself entirely as an energetic activities for the prosperity
00:34:33.20 --> 00:34:39.12 of the motherland and the happiness of the people, for the reunification of the country and
00:34:39.12 --> 00:34:48.24 independence of the world till the last moments of his life departed from us to our greatest
00:34:48.24 --> 00:34:55.72 sorrow.
00:34:55.72 --> 00:34:58.44 Very disturbing.
00:34:58.44 --> 00:35:01.60 And what's crazy is you hear all these bureaucratic names.
00:35:01.60 --> 00:35:02.84 That's what's crazy about it.
00:35:02.84 --> 00:35:13.04 So these government organizations picking away at the people.
00:35:13.04 --> 00:35:21.36 And here's some of the reactions the morning that went through and people like Mrs.
00:35:21.36 --> 00:35:23.000 Song who is a true believer.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.36 This is how they felt.
00:35:25.36 --> 00:35:30.000 The old women wailed.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.88 How could you leave us so suddenly the men screamed?
00:35:33.88 --> 00:35:38.70 Those waiting in line would jump up and down, pound their heads, collapse into theatrical
00:35:38.70 --> 00:35:45.96 spoons, rip their clothes and pound their fists at the air in futile rage.
00:35:45.96 --> 00:35:49.72 The men wept copiously as the women.
00:35:49.72 --> 00:35:54.40 The hystronics of the grief took on a competitive quality.
00:35:54.40 --> 00:35:55.92 Who could weep the loudest?
00:35:55.92 --> 00:35:58.48 Who was most distraught?
00:35:58.48 --> 00:36:05.52 The mourners were eggdone by the TV news which broadcast hours and hours of people wailing
00:36:05.52 --> 00:36:10.20 grown men with tears rolling down their cheeks banging their heads on trees, sailors banging
00:36:10.20 --> 00:36:16.16 their heads against the mass of their ships, pilots weeping in the cockpit and so on.
00:36:16.16 --> 00:36:22.40 These scenes were interspersed with footage of lightning and pouring rain.
00:36:22.40 --> 00:36:26.32 It looked like Armageddon.
00:36:26.32 --> 00:36:33.48 Our country is enveloped in the deepest sorrow in the 5,000 year history of the Korean nation
00:36:33.48 --> 00:36:40.08 in tone and an answer on television.
00:36:40.08 --> 00:36:43.40 And they had these little myths that they threw out there like this one.
00:36:43.40 --> 00:36:45.36 Here's an official release.
00:36:45.36 --> 00:36:52.28 When the great martial died, thousands of cranes descended from heaven to fetch him.
00:36:52.28 --> 00:36:57.08 The birds couldn't take him because they saw that North Koreans cried and screamed and
00:36:57.08 --> 00:37:04.68 pummeled their chests, pulled their hair and pounded the ground.
00:37:04.68 --> 00:37:12.80 They couldn't let him go.
00:37:12.80 --> 00:37:27.12 Nonetheless, despite the heroic efforts of the grand martial, the famine continued.
00:37:27.12 --> 00:37:36.16 Here we go to another person in the book whose name is Dr. Kim, a woman doctor in North
00:37:36.16 --> 00:37:37.88 Korea.
00:37:37.88 --> 00:37:45.000 In the pediatric world, Dr. Kim noticed that her patients were exhibiting peculiar symptoms.
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.20 The children she treated born in the late 1980s and early 1990s were surprisingly smaller,
00:37:52.20 --> 00:37:57.84 even smaller than she'd been as the tiniest kid in her elementary school class.
00:37:57.84 --> 00:38:04.16 Now their upper arms were so skinny she couldn't circle them with her thumb and forefingers.
00:38:04.16 --> 00:38:06.56 Their muscle tone was weak.
00:38:06.56 --> 00:38:12.48 It was a syndrome known as a wasting where the starved body eats away at its own muscle
00:38:12.48 --> 00:38:14.88 tissue.
00:38:14.88 --> 00:38:21.72 Children came in for constipation that was so acute they were dulled over and pain, screaming.
00:38:21.72 --> 00:38:24.56 The problem was with the food.
00:38:24.56 --> 00:38:29.12 How's lives had started to pick weeds and wild grasses to add to their soup to create
00:38:29.12 --> 00:38:32.12 an illusion of vegetables?
00:38:32.12 --> 00:38:38.84 One was increasingly the staple again instead of rice, but people were adding leaves, husks,
00:38:38.84 --> 00:38:42.80 stems, and cobs to make it go further.
00:38:42.80 --> 00:38:51.28 That was okay for adults, but it couldn't be digested by the tendered stomachs of children.
00:38:51.28 --> 00:38:54.04 The babies were in the worst shapes.
00:38:54.04 --> 00:39:00.48 Their mothers themselves, undernourished, didn't produce enough breast milk for them.
00:39:00.48 --> 00:39:06.000 The beef formula was non-existent and milk was rare.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.12 In the past, mothers who couldn't produce enough breast milk would feed their babies a water
00:39:10.12 --> 00:39:23.04 down, congee made from cooked rice, but now most of them couldn't afford rice either.
00:39:23.04 --> 00:39:28.96 Here's Dr. Kim talking about the toddlers.
00:39:28.96 --> 00:39:31.92 They would look at me with accusing eyes.
00:39:31.92 --> 00:39:38.72 Even four-year-olds knew they were dying, and that I wasn't doing anything to help them.
00:39:38.72 --> 00:39:43.72 Dr. Kim told me years later, all I was capable of doing was to cry with their mothers
00:39:43.72 --> 00:39:48.72 and their bodies afterwards.
00:39:48.72 --> 00:39:53.32 Dr. Kim hadn't been a doctor long enough to have erected the protective wall that would
00:39:53.32 --> 00:39:57.08 insulate her from the suffering around her.
00:39:57.08 --> 00:40:01.52 The children's pain was her pain.
00:40:01.52 --> 00:40:07.76 Years later, when I asked her if she remembered any of the children who had died on her
00:40:07.76 --> 00:40:18.16 watch, she answered sharply, I remember all of them.
00:40:18.16 --> 00:40:25.44 Now me ran, has graduated from college and she's an actual school teacher.
00:40:25.44 --> 00:40:30.12 And actually, requirement of school teachers was that they need to know how to play the
00:40:30.12 --> 00:40:33.72 accordion, which is like a transportable instrument.
00:40:33.72 --> 00:40:38.68 So therefore, it's considered to be a good thing because you could carry it on a march.
00:40:38.68 --> 00:40:41.44 So all school teachers had to play the accordion of these.
00:40:41.44 --> 00:40:48.96 They sang songs like this, and they would sing it with the class.
00:40:48.96 --> 00:40:53.40 Our father, we have nothing to envy in the world.
00:40:53.40 --> 00:40:57.28 Our house is within the embrace of the workers' party.
00:40:57.28 --> 00:41:00.20 We are all brothers and sisters.
00:41:00.20 --> 00:41:06.40 Even if a sea of fire comes towards us, sweet children do not need to be afraid.
00:41:06.40 --> 00:41:09.56 Our father is here.
00:41:09.56 --> 00:41:14.08 We have nothing to envy in this world.
00:41:14.08 --> 00:41:18.76 Another one of the songs that they'd sang, where have we gone?
00:41:18.76 --> 00:41:20.80 We've gone to the forest.
00:41:20.80 --> 00:41:23.80 Where are we going? We're going over the hills.
00:41:23.80 --> 00:41:25.96 What are we going to do?
00:41:25.96 --> 00:41:31.20 We are going to kill Japanese soldiers.
00:41:31.20 --> 00:41:38.84 And another classic that was taught in the music class is called Shoot the Yankee Bastards.
00:41:38.84 --> 00:41:44.24 Our enemies are the American bastards who are trying to take over our beautiful fatherland,
00:41:44.24 --> 00:41:51.76 with guns that I make with my own hands, I will shoot them, bang, bang, bang, that idea of
00:41:51.76 --> 00:41:55.12 nothing to envy in the world.
00:41:55.12 --> 00:42:00.000 And again, as you read through this book, you hear the people saying that they believed
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.80 wholeheartedly that they had nothing to envy in the world, that this dismal life of starvation
00:42:07.80 --> 00:42:15.96 or near starvation was as good as it gets.
00:42:15.96 --> 00:42:19.64 And here's what the hunger would look like in school according to Miran.
00:42:19.64 --> 00:42:23.92 Each child was supposed to bring from home a bundle of firewood for the furnace in the
00:42:23.92 --> 00:42:28.92 school basement, but many had trouble carrying it.
00:42:28.92 --> 00:42:32.60 Their big heads, rolled on top of Scrawney Necks.
00:42:32.60 --> 00:42:36.80 Their delicate rib cages protruded over their waist so small that she could encircle them
00:42:36.80 --> 00:42:39.04 with her hands.
00:42:39.04 --> 00:42:41.44 Some of them were starting to swell in the stomach.
00:42:41.44 --> 00:42:46.12 It was all becoming clear to her, Miran remembered seeing a photograph of a famine victim
00:42:46.12 --> 00:42:48.68 in Somalia with a protruding stomach.
00:42:48.68 --> 00:42:53.12 Although she didn't know the medical terminology, she remembered from her teachers'
00:42:53.12 --> 00:42:59.56 college course on nutrition that was caused by severe protein deficiency.
00:42:59.56 --> 00:43:06.44 Miran also noticed that the children's black hair was getting lighter, more copper-toned.
00:43:06.44 --> 00:43:09.56 It was always the same progression.
00:43:09.56 --> 00:43:13.48 First the family wouldn't be able to send the quota of firewood.
00:43:13.48 --> 00:43:16.20 Then the lunch bag would disappear.
00:43:16.20 --> 00:43:21.32 Then the childhood stopped participating in class and would sleep through recess.
00:43:21.32 --> 00:43:26.76 Then without explanation, the childhood stopped coming to school.
00:43:26.76 --> 00:43:34.60 Over three years in Roman and the kindergarten dropped from 50 students to 15.
00:43:34.60 --> 00:43:38.12 What happened to all those children?
00:43:38.12 --> 00:43:44.48 Miran didn't pry too deeply for fear, the answer she didn't want to hear.
00:43:44.48 --> 00:43:54.76 A decade later, when Miran was a mother herself, trying to lose her post-pagnancy weight
00:43:54.76 --> 00:44:01.52 through aerobics, this period of her life waited like a stone on her conscience.
00:44:01.52 --> 00:44:07.96 She often felt sick over what she did and didn't do to help the young students.
00:44:07.96 --> 00:44:12.56 How could she have eaten so well herself when they were starving?
00:44:12.56 --> 00:44:17.92 Is axiomatic that one death is a tragedy, a thousand a statistic?
00:44:17.92 --> 00:44:20.44 So it was for Miran.
00:44:20.44 --> 00:44:25.56 What she didn't realize is that in her, there's that her indifference was an acquired
00:44:25.56 --> 00:44:27.88 survival skill.
00:44:27.88 --> 00:44:35.32 In order to get through the 1990s alive, one had to suppress any impulse to share food.
00:44:35.32 --> 00:44:40.56 To avoid going insane, one had to learn to stop caring.
00:44:40.56 --> 00:44:44.72 In time, Miran would learn how to walk around a dead body on the street without paying
00:44:44.72 --> 00:44:46.64 much attention.
00:44:46.64 --> 00:44:53.000 She could pass a five-year-old on the verge of death without feeling obliged to help.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.28 If she wasn't going to share food with her favorite pupil, she certainly wasn't going
00:44:57.28 --> 00:45:01.12 to help a perfect stranger.
00:45:01.12 --> 00:45:02.56 And here's some...
00:45:02.56 --> 00:45:12.16 I guess I would say thoughts on a famine or realities of a famine.
00:45:12.16 --> 00:45:17.96 In a famine, people don't necessarily starve to death.
00:45:17.96 --> 00:45:21.84 Often some other ailment gets them first.
00:45:21.84 --> 00:45:26.76 Chronic malnutrition impairs the body's ability to battle infection and the hungry become
00:45:26.76 --> 00:45:32.92 increasingly susceptible to tuberculosis and typhoid.
00:45:32.92 --> 00:45:38.000 The starved body is too weak to metabolize antibiotics, even if they're available.
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.04 And normally curable illnesses suddenly become fatal.
00:45:44.04 --> 00:45:50.20 Wild fluctuations of body chemistry can trigger strokes and heart attacks.
00:45:50.20 --> 00:45:55.52 People die from eating substitute foods that their bodies can't digest.
00:45:55.52 --> 00:46:01.48 The situation can be a sneaky killer that disguises itself under bland statistics of increased
00:46:01.48 --> 00:46:06.24 child mortality or decreased life expectancy.
00:46:06.24 --> 00:46:15.56 It leaves behind only circumstantial evidence of excess morality, excess mortality, statistics
00:46:15.56 --> 00:46:20.64 that show a higher than normal death during a certain period.
00:46:20.64 --> 00:46:24.64 Yet another gratuitous cruelty.
00:46:24.64 --> 00:46:28.68 The killer, famine, targets the most innocent.
00:46:28.68 --> 00:46:35.96 The people who'd never steal food lie, cheat, break the law, or betray a friend.
00:46:35.96 --> 00:46:42.80 It was a phenomenon that the Italian writer Primo Levi identified after merging from Auschwitz.
00:46:42.80 --> 00:46:48.04 When he wrote that he and his fellow survivors never wanted to see another one again,
00:46:48.04 --> 00:46:54.84 one another again after the war because they had all done something of which they were ashamed.
00:46:54.84 --> 00:46:59.68 As Mrs. Song would observe a decade later when she thought back on all the people she knew
00:46:59.68 --> 00:47:06.24 who died during those years, it was the simple and kind-hearted people who did what they
00:47:06.24 --> 00:47:19.68 were told they were the first to die.
00:47:19.68 --> 00:47:27.28 By 1998, an estimated 600,000 to 2 million North Koreans had died as a result of the famine,
00:47:27.28 --> 00:47:31.12 as much as 10% of the population.
00:47:31.12 --> 00:47:37.44 By the end of 1998, the worst of the famine was over, not necessarily because anything
00:47:37.44 --> 00:47:44.96 had improved, but as Mrs. Song later surmised because there were fewer mouths to feed.
00:47:44.96 --> 00:47:50.64 Everybody who was going to die was already dead.
00:47:50.64 --> 00:47:57.68 Now that's how the famine wrapped up, but to go a little bit in depth of what it was
00:47:57.68 --> 00:48:05.28 like once the famine was raging, people became homeless, which was strange because in North
00:48:05.28 --> 00:48:08.64 Korea they never had a problem with homelessness because if you wanted food, you needed to
00:48:08.64 --> 00:48:11.56 live in your home because the government would allegedly bring you food.
00:48:11.56 --> 00:48:14.36 Well once they weren't bringing food anymore, there was no reason to stay at home.
00:48:14.36 --> 00:48:19.60 So now you had people going out trying to survive.
00:48:19.60 --> 00:48:25.56 And this talks a little bit about that, especially for the children.
00:48:25.56 --> 00:48:29.80 It was a dangerous life that children couldn't sleep without worrying that somebody perhaps
00:48:29.80 --> 00:48:33.36 another gang member would steal what little they had.
00:48:33.36 --> 00:48:38.28 There were strange stories going around about adults who prayed on children, not just
00:48:38.28 --> 00:48:41.96 for sex, but for food.
00:48:41.96 --> 00:48:47.36 Hayak was told about people who had drugged children, killed them, and butcher them
00:48:47.36 --> 00:48:51.56 from meat.
00:48:51.56 --> 00:48:57.88 Behind the station near the railroad tracks were vendors who cooked up soup and noodles over
00:48:57.88 --> 00:48:59.40 small burners.
00:48:59.40 --> 00:49:07.64 And it was said that the gray chunks of meat floating in the broth were human flesh.
00:49:07.64 --> 00:49:10.60 The story's gotten more and more horrific.
00:49:10.60 --> 00:49:17.24 Supposedly one father went so insane with hunger that he ate his own baby.
00:49:17.24 --> 00:49:23.60 A market woman was said to have been arrested for selling soup made from human bones.
00:49:23.60 --> 00:49:29.56 For my interviews with the defectors, it does appear that there were cases in which people
00:49:29.56 --> 00:49:36.16 were arrested and executed for cannibalism.
00:49:36.16 --> 00:49:43.20 What did our wonderful leaders do during this?
00:49:43.20 --> 00:49:49.68 What did the leaders know about the people who started black markets and started growing
00:49:49.68 --> 00:49:56.64 these gardens and selling what they could to get people started to try and survive through
00:49:56.64 --> 00:50:02.20 exercising their personal freedoms.
00:50:02.20 --> 00:50:06.000 And here's one of the ways that they're here's their comments about this.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.28 This is coming from Kim Jong-il as well as any of the world's strong men.
00:50:13.28 --> 00:50:20.40 He understood perfectly the cliche that an absolute-dist regime needs absolute power.
00:50:20.40 --> 00:50:25.60 Everything good in life was to be bequeathed by the government.
00:50:25.60 --> 00:50:30.76 He couldn't tolerate people going off to gather their own food or buying rice with their
00:50:30.76 --> 00:50:34.000 own money.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.56 Having people to solve the food problem on their own only increases the number of farmers
00:50:38.56 --> 00:50:40.96 markets and pedellers.
00:50:40.96 --> 00:50:46.72 In addition, this creates egoism among the people and the base of the party's class may
00:50:46.72 --> 00:50:51.56 come to collapse.
00:50:51.56 --> 00:50:57.60 So he's trying to stop people from solving the problems themselves which they have the
00:50:57.60 --> 00:51:01.68 capability to do and they don't talk about it too deeply here but they go into the
00:51:01.68 --> 00:51:05.68 massive black market that was started and there was people that were surviving or people that were
00:51:06.88 --> 00:51:10.64 doing that that were figuring out a way to make money.
00:51:13.68 --> 00:51:20.48 And Kim Jong-il retaliated against that free market excessively to try and stop it.
00:51:20.48 --> 00:51:29.52 It was better that people die of starvation than they have the freedom to try and let their
00:51:29.52 --> 00:51:32.96 get their family to survive.
00:51:32.96 --> 00:51:41.36 And here's an example of what they did with one man that was trying to get money so his
00:51:41.36 --> 00:51:44.24 family could survive back to the book.
00:51:44.24 --> 00:51:50.44 The man was accused of climbing electric poles and cutting copper wire to sell.
00:51:50.44 --> 00:51:54.96 The theft caused extensive damage to the nation's property and was done with the intention
00:51:54.96 --> 00:52:00.72 to damage our social system. It was an act of treason that aided the enemies of the socialist
00:52:00.72 --> 00:52:05.76 state. The prosecutor read his voice bellowing through the scratchy speakers.
00:52:07.12 --> 00:52:12.80 Then a man acting as a sort of lawyer for the accused spoke, although he offered no defense.
00:52:13.68 --> 00:52:17.04 I have determined that what the prosecutor says is true.
00:52:17.04 --> 00:52:24.64 The accused is the hereby sentence to death and the sentence will be carried out immediately
00:52:24.64 --> 00:52:32.88 to create a third man. The condemned man was bound to a wooden stake at the eyes,
00:52:32.88 --> 00:52:41.68 the chest, and the legs. The firing squad would aim to sever the ropes in order.
00:52:41.68 --> 00:52:46.40 Three bullets in each location, nine in total, top to bottom.
00:52:48.40 --> 00:52:53.92 First, the lifeless head would slump over so that the body would crumple in an orderly heap
00:52:53.92 --> 00:52:55.20 at the foot of the stake.
00:52:56.56 --> 00:53:02.96 Neat and efficient. It would look like the condemned man was bowing in death
00:53:03.84 --> 00:53:05.28 as if to apologize.
00:53:05.28 --> 00:53:13.12 A murmur went through the crowd who thought the execution was excessive punishment for a minor
00:53:13.12 --> 00:53:20.40 theft. The electric lines weren't working anyways. The few meters of copper wiring the man
00:53:20.40 --> 00:53:24.000 had stolen probably had gotten him no more than a few bags of rice.
00:53:25.68 --> 00:53:30.72 A pity. He has a younger sister, somebody said, two sisters said another.
00:53:30.72 --> 00:53:38.08 The man's parents must be dead. Clearly, he knew nobody would influence to intervene on his
00:53:38.08 --> 00:53:43.84 behalf. He probably had a poor class background as well, maybe he was the son of a minor.
00:53:48.16 --> 00:53:58.40 The shots rang out. Head chest legs. The head burst open like a water balloon.
00:53:58.40 --> 00:54:04.88 Blood spurred out over the dirt almost spilling onto the feet of the crowd.
00:54:04.88 --> 00:54:29.92 What do people do to stop this? You have rebellion in the world. You have people turned against
00:54:29.92 --> 00:54:37.92 the government in the world. But in North Korea, that did not happen.
00:54:39.20 --> 00:54:46.16 And here's why the level of repression in North Korea was so great that no organized resistance could take
00:54:46.16 --> 00:54:56.32 root. Any anti-regime activity would have terrible consequences for the protester, his immediate family,
00:54:56.32 --> 00:55:04.08 and all other known relatives. Under a system that sought to stamp out tainted blood for
00:55:04.08 --> 00:55:11.52 three generations, the punishment would extend to parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters,
00:55:11.52 --> 00:55:19.52 nieces, nephews, and cousins. A lot of people felt if you had to give one life,
00:55:19.52 --> 00:55:27.52 you would give it to get rid of this terrible regime. But here, you are not the only one getting
00:55:27.52 --> 00:55:40.80 punished. Your whole family would go through hell. So with the fact that they're going to,
00:55:40.80 --> 00:55:51.76 if you protest, they're going to kill everybody. So there was no protest. So now the only thing you can
00:55:51.76 --> 00:56:04.08 possibly think of doing is escaping. And it goes through the various people in the book and
00:56:04.08 --> 00:56:11.60 how they escaped. But I thought what was interesting, in fact, the most interesting sort of mental
00:56:11.60 --> 00:56:17.60 transition to make was from Mrs. Song, and again, she was referred to as the true believer.
00:56:19.04 --> 00:56:30.56 And her daughter had escaped and made it actually to South Korea. And her daughter arranged to have
00:56:30.56 --> 00:56:38.80 Mrs. Song visit China. But she visited China sort of against the rules thinking that she was
00:56:38.80 --> 00:56:45.28 going to go back to North Korea. Because she truly believed that North Korea was the better place.
00:56:47.28 --> 00:56:55.92 She believed that South Korea was the enemy and it was evil. And so she spends, but she does go to
00:56:55.92 --> 00:57:02.96 China. And she spends some time in China. And when she's in China, she's staying in a house
00:57:02.96 --> 00:57:08.56 that her daughter set up for her to stay in and they have TV. And they have microwave oven,
00:57:08.56 --> 00:57:15.76 and they have dishwasher. And they have a rice cooker, which is miraculous to her. I mean,
00:57:15.76 --> 00:57:20.32 she's talking about it. She's saying, at a certain time, the light would come on and it would
00:57:20.32 --> 00:57:25.60 make a trip. And that means the rice was now being cooked. And by the way, at this time, they didn't
00:57:25.60 --> 00:57:30.88 have rice in North Korea. So there's this thing that just automatically cooks up your rice in the morning.
00:57:32.08 --> 00:57:37.68 And it was that combination of things that broke her. Because when she first saw that stuff,
00:57:37.68 --> 00:57:41.68 she said, oh, this is imperialistic. You know, this is capitalism. It's evil. They're trying to buy
00:57:41.68 --> 00:57:46.48 us and slay us with their capitalism. That's what she'd been convinced her whole life.
00:57:46.48 --> 00:57:57.52 And then she has the realization. And I'm going to close with this because after this, it goes
00:57:57.52 --> 00:58:05.36 through the stories of how they escaped and whatnot. But this realization, this moment in time
00:58:05.36 --> 00:58:17.20 when her mind becomes free. And here's how it goes. How much they all, how much had they all missed,
00:58:17.20 --> 00:58:26.32 herself, her daughters locked away in North Korea, working themselves to death for what?
00:58:26.32 --> 00:58:39.44 We will do what the party tells us. We will die for the general. We have nothing to envy.
00:58:39.44 --> 00:58:54.72 She had believed it all and wasted her life or maybe not. Was it really over?
00:58:56.72 --> 00:59:05.36 She was 57 years old, still in good health. This was her wake-up call.
00:59:05.36 --> 00:59:25.92 She was ready to go. So I ask, what is your wake-up call? What is enslaving you?
00:59:25.92 --> 00:59:42.72 What is controlling your thoughts? Is it the television set feeding your mind images of what life should be?
00:59:45.76 --> 00:59:50.08 Is it the internet drawing you in and controlling your time?
00:59:50.08 --> 01:00:04.88 Is it drugs or alcohol numbing your brain and diminishing your desires? Or is it weakness?
01:00:07.28 --> 01:00:13.84 A lack of discipline that prevents you from accomplishing what you want to accomplish.
01:00:13.84 --> 01:00:25.36 And I'm not saying that you have to rebel. I'm not saying that there aren't things in life
01:00:25.36 --> 01:00:34.56 that we just have to do. There are. But what I am saying is ask questions.
01:00:34.56 --> 01:00:42.16 Don't believe everything that you're told and don't follow the path just because it's there.
01:00:46.48 --> 01:00:50.16 Don't get in line just because other people are.
01:00:50.16 --> 01:01:04.24 Get up and wake up and be conscious of what is reaping into your mind.
01:01:05.60 --> 01:01:10.32 What's getting in there? What are you letting in there? What is forcing itself in there?
01:01:10.32 --> 01:01:23.68 And what does it want you to do? You have only one life.
01:01:28.08 --> 01:01:35.84 So don't waste it. Being controlled by someone else.
01:01:35.84 --> 01:01:44.96 That's one of those things. It's everywhere. You can easily be controlled by stuff.
01:01:44.96 --> 01:01:53.20 Like a big one is hate to harp on parents. But your parents. So nobody's perfect.
01:01:53.20 --> 01:01:58.64 So all your imperfections or a lot of your imperfections will be passed onto your kids just because
01:01:58.64 --> 01:02:03.44 you don't know any better. Like that Mrs. Song Lady. She just believed it. She didn't know any better.
01:02:03.44 --> 01:02:12.48 And so you can end up passing these things down like certain traditions or just methodologies of raising kids
01:02:12.48 --> 01:02:20.16 that you might hear otherwise. But that's your thing. You know that you believed it. It crept in your mind because
01:02:20.16 --> 01:02:26.88 your parents, their parents. And you don't ask questions. And you don't ask questions. You're just like, hey, that's how I was raised.
01:02:26.88 --> 01:02:33.60 You passed it on. Meanwhile, you're doing the wrong thing all the time. That's what happens when you don't ask questions.
01:02:33.60 --> 01:02:40.000 That's what happens when you don't ask questions. That's what happens when you believe authority all the time.
01:02:41.44 --> 01:02:44.56 And hey, this might come across as some people are sitting there saying, wait a second.
01:02:44.56 --> 01:02:50.08 Jocca won't you win the military for 20 years? Your damn right, that was. And
01:02:50.08 --> 01:02:58.96 there was a definitely I was a rebellious kid. And when I was in the military, I was always a
01:02:58.96 --> 01:03:05.60 question to everything that we did and why we did it. So and I think that's one of the things that helped me
01:03:06.24 --> 01:03:12.56 get to a leadership position and become a decent leader was the fact that I didn't just take everyone's word for it.
01:03:12.56 --> 01:03:16.96 And say, oh, yeah, that's what we're going to do. Okay. Right. No, you know what, we're actually going to change the strategy.
01:03:16.96 --> 01:03:23.20 We're going to change the tactics. What why was taught is an working right now. We're going to do it differently.
01:03:23.20 --> 01:03:30.000 Yeah, and we did that all the time. Yeah, but this is a broader scale. This is a broader scale.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.52 This is life. Not just in the book, but life in general. Life in general, like what are you doing?
01:03:38.72 --> 01:03:44.96 Where are you getting your direction from? Yeah. Who is, who's got a hold of your steering wheel?
01:03:44.96 --> 01:03:51.44 Yeah. Yeah. And that's make sure it's you that's got a hold of your steering wheel.
01:03:52.24 --> 01:03:55.28 Yeah, and that's one of those things where it's tough because you got a balance it as well.
01:03:55.28 --> 01:04:00.64 You know, so if you're just rolling around saying, hey, nothing's true until I figure it out.
01:04:00.64 --> 01:04:04.64 It's kind of like, you know, you got to consider the opportunity cost where some people, you got it,
01:04:04.64 --> 01:04:09.92 you know, you got to consider their credibility and then you got to kind of just go with it. And again,
01:04:09.92 --> 01:04:15.76 this is just kind of demonstrating like there's a balance there. Yeah, but just like, are you saying if something,
01:04:16.56 --> 01:04:22.56 if it's not working and someone presents you with some alternative, don't just be like, hey,
01:04:22.56 --> 01:04:29.44 I've done it this way. So, you know, leave me alone type of thing. You know, ask those questions and listen to them.
01:04:29.44 --> 01:04:34.000 You know, Shenzhen, sorry, you might find a little improved method and doing some stuff.
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.52 Yeah, or you might find out that you've been sucked into a trap, you know,
01:04:37.52 --> 01:04:43.92 you don't want to be in. No, you've got to free your mind. You've got to free your mind.
01:04:43.92 --> 01:04:50.64 You've got to get out of that box out of that cage. You know, think of that. You know, I meet people now.
01:04:52.24 --> 01:05:03.20 And it's so bizarre because because I've traveled a lot and I've walked with a lot of different kind of people,
01:05:03.20 --> 01:05:09.12 you know, from all different walks of life. And I meet people sometimes,
01:05:10.96 --> 01:05:14.000 and I think to myself, man, this guy's pretty awesome. He's got all this, you know,
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.88 I don't know what this person's goal is. And sometimes I'll ask like, you know, what do you want to do?
01:05:19.52 --> 01:05:25.52 I'm like, what do you, hey, how many some kid or what you want to do? And some people say,
01:05:26.16 --> 01:05:32.96 you know, well, I want to do, you know, I think they're, I think they're going to come out with this giant
01:05:32.96 --> 01:05:45.68 dream. And they come out with like a, um, little mediocre idea. And I, and I, and I haven't done this yet.
01:05:46.32 --> 01:05:53.92 I've talked to five people in the last six months that I thought we're going to tell me about their dream
01:05:55.60 --> 01:06:02.40 and that I was going to be like in shock. And I was going to be impressed and say, yeah, that's what I'm
01:06:02.40 --> 01:06:11.36 talking about, brother, go get it. And instead, I had to bite my tongue because they were telling
01:06:11.36 --> 01:06:17.52 me their dream, but it wasn't big enough. It wasn't big enough. It wasn't, it was too realistic.
01:06:18.88 --> 01:06:22.32 You know, you know, now you meet some people sometimes and they tell me their dream, and I go,
01:06:22.32 --> 01:06:27.36 man, you ain't got a chance of that. You need to, you need to tone that down. You need to get a grip.
01:06:27.36 --> 01:06:32.96 Right. These people are like, you can achieve anything you want. No, actually, you can't achieve anything
01:06:32.96 --> 01:06:39.36 you want. If you could achieve anything you want, you know, everyone would be sitting on a yacht or doing
01:06:39.36 --> 01:06:45.76 whatever big bad ass thing that they want to do. It depends the way you mean by can't, though. But yeah,
01:06:45.76 --> 01:06:53.20 yeah, it's true. I mean can't. That's what I mean. These, these people that are like you can do
01:06:53.20 --> 01:06:58.80 whatever you want. No, actually, there's limitations to that. All people are not created equal.
01:06:59.52 --> 01:07:02.96 Some people are smarter than other people. Some people are better athletes than other people.
01:07:04.72 --> 01:07:13.36 Hey, reality. Now, what can you hear the question isn't that the question is, what can you do?
01:07:13.36 --> 01:07:23.44 With what you've got? What can you do? And I'd much rather, I love to hear people over shooting.
01:07:24.80 --> 01:07:30.24 But don't trap yourself in a box where you're like, well, I'll be happy if I can do this.
01:07:32.48 --> 01:07:37.84 And there's the other part of this is it's sort of like North Korea. There's people that are
01:07:37.84 --> 01:07:44.16 trapped in a paradigm in their head of the world. They think that the world is this thing that they
01:07:44.16 --> 01:07:51.76 live in. They think that the world is this small, this small place, the people that they know.
01:07:52.96 --> 01:07:59.04 And the atmosphere that they live inside. And it's really, really small.
01:08:01.68 --> 01:08:07.68 And I think to myself, man, you got to get out. And I'll tell you a part of this came when I
01:08:07.68 --> 01:08:13.68 got out of the military. Because my whole life, the only guys I knew were seals. I mean, that's just
01:08:13.68 --> 01:08:18.64 who I knew. And so when I got out and I started meeting other people. And I especially started
01:08:18.64 --> 01:08:25.84 working with big business and started meeting really not just successful in terms of financial
01:08:26.48 --> 01:08:32.48 people. But people that had really done something. And I started realizing that there was a whole
01:08:32.48 --> 01:08:38.80 other level, not a higher level. But there's just another world. Like in the seal teams, oh, well,
01:08:38.80 --> 01:08:43.76 you know, I did, I did my seal opportunity to silk to commander. You know, you do these certain,
01:08:43.76 --> 01:08:47.76 I did task in a commander. You do these things. And that's what you do. And it's awesome.
01:08:48.48 --> 01:08:54.24 And that's a whole world. But there's other worlds. And I'm ever telling one of my
01:08:54.24 --> 01:08:59.28 seal buddies, we were out surfing. And this is after I'd been out for like two years. I had this
01:08:59.28 --> 01:09:05.44 exact conversation with them. I said, hey, man, like we were talking, we're out there surfing for an hour.
01:09:05.44 --> 01:09:09.60 And for 58 minutes, we're talking about the seal teams, the seal teams, the seal teams, the
01:09:09.60 --> 01:09:17.28 seal teams. And then I said, hey, man, the seal teams is awesome. But just so you know,
01:09:18.96 --> 01:09:24.96 there's other things in the world. And it's stuff that I'm saying, my mind was in North Korea.
01:09:24.96 --> 01:09:31.52 My mind was just seal team. And I'll tell you what, I'm glad it was because it made my life very
01:09:31.52 --> 01:09:38.000 simple. And I still, you know, obviously, I love the seal teams more than anything. But there are
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.96 other worlds out there. And you can do other things in the world. And so now when I meet people in different
01:09:44.96 --> 01:09:54.72 environments and different jobs and each little, each little environment that I poke my head into,
01:09:54.72 --> 01:10:00.32 because we work in different industries all over different, you know, manufacturing and gas oil,
01:10:01.36 --> 01:10:07.12 and financial. And then all their own little worlds. And sometimes people are trapped in those
01:10:07.12 --> 01:10:15.76 worlds. And I just want to say, man, free your mind, free your mind and see what else is out there.
01:10:15.76 --> 01:10:22.88 Yeah, kind of like what you and Tim, Tim Kennedy, we're talking about. How you guys, you guys are
01:10:22.88 --> 01:10:28.24 in examples, people who have seen the really, really bad parts of the world and the really,
01:10:28.24 --> 01:10:32.16 really good parts of the world. Because you guys travel all over and you live in San Diego,
01:10:32.16 --> 01:10:36.40 which is, you know, arguably one of the one of the best places to live. So you have that expanded view.
01:10:36.96 --> 01:10:42.000 Meanwhile, some people, they only go on vacation when they travel. So they have, although a
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.08 real positive and really nice view, but it's really narrow. Or other people who only lived in
01:10:48.08 --> 01:10:52.96 bad places, just like people who grew up in a real negative household, when they go out into the
01:10:52.96 --> 01:10:58.000 world, just their beginning view of the world is negative. Like money is just so hard to come by,
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.48 because when they grew up, their parents were complaining about the rent and bills are piling
01:11:02.48 --> 01:11:06.48 off and all this stuff. So that's their attitude when they go out. And then that's how they kind of
01:11:06.48 --> 01:11:11.44 take on the world. Man, I know this and this is kind of a different thing, same subject, same subject.
01:11:11.44 --> 01:11:17.84 But I had a friend in high school and this people, I grew up in quite smiling and why. So
01:11:18.72 --> 01:11:24.000 some people straight up have their whole life haven't been off of quite. And no less the mainland.
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.40 The mainland is this fantasy world place where Disney land is and Hollywood and all this stuff.
01:11:29.60 --> 01:11:35.28 So I had a friend, one of my good friends, he moved to the mainland, but it was just a small
01:11:35.28 --> 01:11:40.08 teeny tiny town, just a small is quite. So I remember one time where what state was the downed
01:11:40.08 --> 01:11:46.48 Colorado, Colorado, he moved to Pueblo, he's called. So I remember we were just having a
01:11:46.48 --> 01:11:50.32 conversation later and I was like, hey, yeah, let's go to Las Vegas, a lot of white people
01:11:50.32 --> 01:11:54.80 go to Las Vegas and I was like, let's go to Las Vegas or whatever, I was like, when do you
01:11:54.80 --> 01:12:00.48 what do you do? You run into car, he was like, I would never drive in Las Vegas. I would never drive
01:12:00.48 --> 01:12:04.32 in Las Vegas because it's too crazy. You know, there's freeways, there's no freeway on
01:12:04.32 --> 01:12:12.16 quite on a wall there, there's a highway, but and he a grown adult. So it is true.
01:12:13.20 --> 01:12:17.84 Can't even drive, you know, so that's like an example, that's how narrow his whole view was
01:12:17.84 --> 01:12:23.28 world, his whole world and that extended to his driving skill. You know, this was just
01:12:23.28 --> 01:12:29.60 the sohactic on a freeway highway Las Vegas, even, I don't even know how crazy that is. I mean,
01:12:29.60 --> 01:12:33.12 that's not a crazy place to drive really, you know, come here to like, I don't know, I would
01:12:33.12 --> 01:12:39.20 buy whatever, yeah, or so to LA, man, hit the 405 North on a Thursday afternoon.
01:12:42.16 --> 01:12:47.60 Yeah, there's no doubt there's so much out there and if you stay comfortable in your world,
01:12:48.32 --> 01:12:53.44 you can get used, you can get comfortable starving in North Korea. Yeah, that's what the scary
01:12:53.44 --> 01:12:59.20 thing is. That's the point that I think I'm trying to make is don't be comfortable because what you
01:12:59.20 --> 01:13:08.96 think is awesome right now, there could be so much more, you know, if you can envision and
01:13:08.96 --> 01:13:14.24 pay attention to what's going on in the rest of the world and break out of that paradigm that you're
01:13:14.24 --> 01:13:27.12 in and see that you can fly, you can fly around the world, you can do it. You know, don't get
01:13:27.12 --> 01:13:36.48 trapped in free your mind. Yeah. All right, let's get to some questions from the interwebs,
01:13:36.48 --> 01:13:43.92 in a web, speaking of interwebs, if you like supplements, good supplements, which I think we both
01:13:43.92 --> 01:13:52.88 recommend, right, as far as supplements go, get on it supplements and then we are sponsored
01:13:52.88 --> 01:13:57.60 as it so happens by on it. But I would say get on it supplements anyway because I was taking them
01:13:57.60 --> 01:14:04.24 even before we're sponsored by on it. On it dot com slash jockel and get 10% off. Get your
01:14:04.24 --> 01:14:10.32 krull oil supplements. Get your alpha brain. Yeah, krull oil and krill oil is anything for your
01:14:10.32 --> 01:14:15.84 joints is critical because like when you even even when I was young, when you live hard, when you
01:14:15.84 --> 01:14:24.48 get after it, working out. So, okay, so if you gain strength, right, which of course we all kind
01:14:24.48 --> 01:14:30.16 of want to do or whatever, you don't have to put a whatever on the end. We just all want to.
01:14:30.16 --> 01:14:34.64 Period. Jeremy, that's not to speak for everyone, but I think it's safe to assume that yes,
01:14:35.36 --> 01:14:39.76 we're getting straight strength. But when you have a higher capacity for strength, a lot of times
01:14:39.76 --> 01:14:45.52 your muscles will just want to fire real hard. So what that can end up with is this weird
01:14:45.52 --> 01:14:49.68 stiffness, you know, so you're going to end like it's like you've got to it's almost like you've got
01:14:49.68 --> 01:14:54.64 a warm up in life. It's almost like that feeling, you know. So it's like yeah, you're strong. You're
01:14:54.64 --> 01:15:01.20 about to carry like the whole blow of groceries in and you can do that. It may be you know,
01:15:01.20 --> 01:15:06.48 you're road agrocy. You've got to come up. I'm just saying every day stuff. And you can you can
01:15:06.48 --> 01:15:09.84 get after it doing that, but you kind of got a warm up, you know, it's kind of like,
01:15:09.84 --> 01:15:16.72 kind of do you have any groceries you have? A lot, man. Get after it in the store out of the store.
01:15:16.72 --> 01:15:22.16 So anyway, so the point being like when you have stuff like for your joints or you don't take
01:15:22.16 --> 01:15:26.24 care of your joints. See, I would have told this totally differently. I like if you want to jack
01:15:26.24 --> 01:15:31.28 big steel, you want to do GG-Jitsu, you want to jump off things, you want to throw stuff around,
01:15:31.28 --> 01:15:37.28 get some creloys, so you stay healthy. Yeah, that groceries. No, but I'm saying no, it's it's
01:15:37.28 --> 01:15:43.76 it seems kind of productive because I've experienced this where I'm like, yeah, but then I kind of
01:15:43.76 --> 01:15:50.08 got to like do twists, you know, and then I'm strong, you know, then I'm ready to do it. Or if I'm like
01:15:50.08 --> 01:15:53.52 kind of stupid, it's kind of cold out and then I go to live, I'm like dang, I can live a lot of
01:15:53.52 --> 01:15:58.80 weights, but why on this first set, I can't even lift anything. You need to grow. I'm just saying
01:15:58.80 --> 01:16:05.92 your joints got to be like good to go. That was all in your inspiration. Right, it's absolutely
01:16:05.92 --> 01:16:11.36 true. I'm telling you, if you take that to a heart, well, you already take real oils. Yeah,
01:16:11.36 --> 01:16:19.68 yeah, anyway, yeah, on it.com slash jockel, get 10% off. You happy you did. And if you want to support

01:16:38.32 --> 01:16:44.80 out through one of the the true pursuer in the know. Sometimes you have ad blockers on your browser
01:16:45.60 --> 01:16:50.000 and they're activated, which is a good thing, by the way. It's good to, you know, because sometimes
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.40 they can malware can get back anyway. Yeah, because it's an actual code and it works in, in, in the
01:16:56.40 --> 01:17:03.04 same ways. Don't talk too much. Yeah, anyway, so deactivated, you know, you're going to get past it.
01:17:03.04 --> 01:17:10.24 There it is, or if you want to buy some shirts, which jockels hit and or name on it, go to jockelstore.com.
01:17:10.96 --> 01:17:17.76 That's, it's cool way to represent. Anyway, yep, there it is. All right, let's get it first question.
01:17:17.76 --> 01:17:24.24 In any questions, okay, first question. How do you continue to change your jitsu when hurt or injured?
01:17:24.24 --> 01:17:29.44 Be the same thing with whatever kind of injury I got and whatever I'm going to do, I'm going to do
01:17:29.44 --> 01:17:35.36 what I can. You know, now one thing you do have to do is you have to let yourself rest enough that
01:17:35.36 --> 01:17:40.56 you can heal. Because sometimes they get the spring ankle and instead of lasting one month, it lasts
01:17:40.56 --> 01:17:46.56 18 months, no kidding. If you push, if you just won't let it heal, the thing is not going to heal.
01:17:46.56 --> 01:17:55.60 So you have to let things heal. Now, but you can go through all kinds of positions, you can work
01:17:55.60 --> 01:18:00.08 different transitions, but sometimes you get an injury and if you're a jitsu person, you know what I'm
01:18:00.08 --> 01:18:05.12 talking about. Like, you get a weird injury that you can't do certain movements. Yeah, like,
01:18:05.12 --> 01:18:09.52 guy, I'll have a hurt back, can't get on top. I can't be on top. I can't. So you just practice your
01:18:09.52 --> 01:18:16.88 guard or you have a hurt, you know, groin muscle. So you can't hold any guard. You have to work
01:18:16.88 --> 01:18:22.32 like side control only. Okay, cool. Escape side control or be inside control. So you can definitely
01:18:23.12 --> 01:18:27.44 do those things. You just figure out what movements you can do. You figure out what training
01:18:27.44 --> 01:18:33.60 partners aren't going to go psychopathic on you and just hurt you even worse. So that's important.
01:18:34.88 --> 01:18:38.64 You know, just being in class and you're learning some new technique, you know, I find if
01:18:38.64 --> 01:18:43.52 I cannot roll, when I'm in class, I'll like pay a little bit more attention to what
01:18:43.52 --> 01:18:47.84 the instruction is being given because I know I can't roll. So I know all I'm going to get out of
01:18:47.84 --> 01:18:53.60 this is what I'm going to learn right here from Jeffy Glover or Dean List. And so I will be like
01:18:53.60 --> 01:19:00.40 paying extra special attention. Yeah, that's good. And then I'll tell you, this is something like
01:19:00.40 --> 01:19:05.84 I wear me pads when I roll. And I think that they prevent some injuries from happening. And I just
01:19:05.84 --> 01:19:13.04 made a transition in my life where I used to wear extra large pads. Neaparine knee pads,
01:19:13.04 --> 01:19:17.36 knee-uprene knee pads like knee-uprene. There were some sprays. Yeah, it's not like braces though.
01:19:17.36 --> 01:19:22.16 There's nothing bracing there. Just like a piece of knee-uprene. Yeah, yeah. But I recently
01:19:22.16 --> 01:19:27.52 like two weeks ago, I went, I used to wear extra large and I went to large because they felt
01:19:27.52 --> 01:19:32.80 a little bit stutter and I just got medium and I got some pretty big legs and I got medium and
01:19:32.80 --> 01:19:37.20 they're like really compressing my knees and keeping it all together and they feel really good.
01:19:38.24 --> 01:19:43.12 So maybe just over that legs are sized down to the compression and the same thing like when I
01:19:43.12 --> 01:19:50.24 have heard elbow, I'll put a elbow pad on. So wrap up whatever you can and just keep training.
01:19:50.24 --> 01:19:58.08 And warm up a little bit. Yeah, you know, I didn't use to. I do now. I'll do a
01:19:58.08 --> 01:20:03.04 five-minute round where I'm not trying to kill the person. I'm hoping that the person's not going
01:20:03.04 --> 01:20:07.20 to try to kill me. Although you and I had a little incident the other day we did a little excited
01:20:07.20 --> 01:20:14.40 in that first round. Yes. Just to clarify, when you say knee pads, elbow pads, they're not like
01:20:14.40 --> 01:20:19.12 the kind soccer. No, they're knee-prain. They're just a knee-up like a wetsuit, like a knee-uprene
01:20:19.12 --> 01:20:25.28 knee-prain. A6. Yeah. Clif-kene. Wrestling knee pads. That's what they are. That's what they're called.
01:20:25.28 --> 01:20:31.44 And they're generally made in knee-uprene. Gotcha. Yeah. So a lot of this, the training part of
01:20:31.44 --> 01:20:36.16 everything, that's a big deal. If you choose to train when you're injured, because, man, I can't sit
01:20:36.16 --> 01:20:41.28 here and say train when you're injured and I might even say, don't train, just learn like how you
01:20:41.28 --> 01:20:47.28 say, if you want to show up, because you got the ball. Yeah, you know, you can't just not show up on
01:20:47.28 --> 01:20:51.68 the mats. You know, the mats, even if you're not rolling, it's like, that's a good place to be.
01:20:51.68 --> 01:20:59.28 It's face it for most of us. And you sit in on a class or just do the instruction part of it,
01:20:59.28 --> 01:21:02.40 you know, and do the movements, because you're not going full speed, you know, rolling,
01:21:02.40 --> 01:21:06.56 do the movements that you can and you can pick up a lot, man. In fact, when you, especially,
01:21:06.56 --> 01:21:10.96 you know, how you say, we're learning from Dean, Jeff and mostly instructors here. They're
01:21:10.96 --> 01:21:15.60 really good. Even if you learn one little detail. Even if you know, I know this card pass.
01:21:15.60 --> 01:21:19.20 You know, he added that one little detail to him. Dang, I've been training for all these years
01:21:19.20 --> 01:21:25.60 and I just learned that one. You can always add something. The aim, I think, that's, that's a big deal.
01:21:25.60 --> 01:21:30.24 Show up and be there and you will learn. It's like I was talking to Greg one time,
01:21:30.24 --> 01:21:34.72 long time ago. He was like, we were talking about, hey, so if someone asks you, how long have you
01:21:34.72 --> 01:21:38.72 been training? But let's say you started training 10 years ago. But then you trained for a year.
01:21:38.72 --> 01:21:42.48 You took off a year and then you went back, but you were only training a little bit. You know,
01:21:42.48 --> 01:21:46.96 so how long have you been training? Really? How do you count it and all that anyway? So he was like,
01:21:46.96 --> 01:21:50.80 he didn't go too deep into it, but he was like, no, man, if you started 10 years ago,
01:21:50.80 --> 01:21:55.76 you've been training for 10 years. Because if you start training for a year, even if you take a year off,
01:21:55.76 --> 01:22:00.16 when you see something, you hear something, someone's talking about something. You're picking all that up,
01:22:00.16 --> 01:22:04.72 because you have the context of you know, you know. So your, your brain is similar to the
01:22:04.72 --> 01:22:08.88 into your system and you're fine, even if you're not training. Yep, exactly right. So if you're injured,
01:22:08.88 --> 01:22:14.80 just keep that going. That's a weird thing to do though. There's a little ego situation. If you're like,
01:22:14.80 --> 01:22:22.08 well, I've been training for 13 years, meaning I started 13 years ago, but I took a lot of time off
01:22:22.08 --> 01:22:27.92 it. So you might catch me. Right. Yes. Yeah. That's basically what they're saying. So just tell people
01:22:27.92 --> 01:22:33.20 like I've been training for 13 years. Yeah. You cannot make that kind of a war. You know what?
01:22:33.20 --> 01:22:38.64 Let's see how good I am. Yeah. You know, if in fact get it. Yeah, because I think it's
01:22:38.64 --> 01:22:45.20 coming getting so automatic for the person like, like, if you're at, if you ask me, how long have you been
01:22:45.20 --> 01:22:50.40 training? It's automatic for me to try to justify my skill with my number of how long. You know,
01:22:50.40 --> 01:22:54.40 even though the guy asking typically is just asking for conversation, he's not training
01:22:54.40 --> 01:22:59.44 evaluate how good you're really when I ask the wrong size. There's no, but you're different.
01:22:59.44 --> 01:23:04.64 Hello, you've been training for what's cool. But you're different. You compete.
01:23:04.64 --> 01:23:10.000 Well, I was talking to Keenan about that. Like, how do you do it? And they're kind of
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.88 cycle, though. They'll be like, it's Matt hours. That's how you say it. You do you train for
01:23:14.88 --> 01:23:18.64 10,000 hours. You do that's how long you've been training. I don't know if you're the series or not,
01:23:18.64 --> 01:23:24.96 but that's the one way I look at that. Yeah. I don't know. I don't feel the same way as you though.
01:23:26.24 --> 01:23:30.32 I don't feel what I definitely do. And I'll tell you what, like if I've said this before,
01:23:30.32 --> 01:23:36.40 if my back is tight, nothing better for your back than you do. Yeah. You next little sword,
01:23:36.40 --> 01:23:42.72 you do too. Yeah. Shoulders my little stretch. You do it. No, you, I'm not saying go out there.
01:23:42.72 --> 01:23:45.28 You can be able to kill it. You're going to be able to go like this. You're super hard crazy
01:23:45.28 --> 01:23:49.84 rounds. Not gonna work. Yeah. Yeah. Just be careful. How'd they be here? Yeah.
01:23:51.36 --> 01:23:59.44 Yeah, I am not a doctor. And probably if people listen to me, as if I was a doctor,
01:23:59.44 --> 01:24:04.16 their health would be deteriorating quickly. Yeah. It'd be in question. Yeah. Sure. From time to time.
01:24:04.16 --> 01:24:10.96 Don't sleep eat me train injured. Go. That's my attitude.
01:24:12.24 --> 01:24:17.36 All right. Next question. How crucial is knowing the personality type,
01:24:18.24 --> 01:24:25.68 introvert, extrovert of your colleagues in combat business or choosing an MLS, which is occupation?
01:24:25.68 --> 01:24:32.32 Yeah. How crucial is it to know the personalities of people?
01:24:33.68 --> 01:24:40.80 It's really crucial. Knowing and understanding people is critical in every aspect of life.
01:24:43.52 --> 01:24:52.64 And that being said, the most important part of knowing people is knowing that you really can't
01:24:52.64 --> 01:24:59.92 know people, not 100%. I hear people talk about personality types and there's these tests and
01:24:59.92 --> 01:25:03.68 these categories and stuff like that. And honestly, I've never been familiar with that.
01:25:06.96 --> 01:25:13.68 But you can put people in different categories. But for me, when you put person in a category,
01:25:14.80 --> 01:25:22.000 by themselves, that's only 50% of the situation. The other 50% is the other people that they're
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:29.68 working with. So I want to know not just what type of personality they have,
01:25:30.48 --> 01:25:36.48 because that's a, like I said, that's half of the equation. The other half is how do they interact
01:25:36.48 --> 01:25:44.64 with other people and other people's personalities? How do they handle slackers? How do they handle
01:25:44.64 --> 01:25:49.04 overachievers? How do they handle loud mouths? How do they handle submissive people? How do they handle
01:25:49.04 --> 01:25:53.12 aggressive people? Those are all different personality traits. I want to know, I want to see how
01:25:53.12 --> 01:25:57.68 people are going to handle other personalities. And then I want to also know how they're going to handle
01:25:57.68 --> 01:26:05.44 certain situations. Pressure, conflict, authority, responsibility. I mean, I want to know
01:26:06.48 --> 01:26:11.52 not just what their personalities, but how they're going to react. Because you can get people that are
01:26:12.08 --> 01:26:16.96 a really easy example is people that are super aggressive, but they fold under pressure. And you can
01:26:16.96 --> 01:26:21.76 get people that are super passive that fold under pressure. And vice versa, you can get someone
01:26:21.76 --> 01:26:29.60 that's super quiet and humble and under pressure. They're just strong. So that's what I want to know.
01:26:29.60 --> 01:26:35.36 I don't care what kind of person now do you have? I mean, I do to an extent, but I want to know how
01:26:35.36 --> 01:26:41.04 it interoperates with the world, with the people and with the situations that you're going to face.
01:26:41.04 --> 01:26:44.80 And how do you do that? You do that by observing them while they're dealing with other people
01:26:44.80 --> 01:26:50.64 and while they're dealing with pressure situations. That's just a reality. And you can't,
01:26:51.36 --> 01:26:57.52 you can have an idea. You know, I won't say that you won't be able to predict it, but you'll get
01:26:57.52 --> 01:27:02.72 surprised. Sometimes you get surprised. A lot of person that you think is all tough and they fold
01:27:03.28 --> 01:27:07.76 or people, person that you think is weak and they're strong. So you will get fooled sometimes.
01:27:07.76 --> 01:27:12.80 A lot of times you're, you know, you're probably right 60% of the time, 70% of the time. Yeah,
01:27:12.80 --> 01:27:19.28 big one is also how they react when stuff goes bad. Like when stuff doesn't go their way.
01:27:19.28 --> 01:27:25.12 Yeah, you know, and that's a spectrum too, but you can meet someone and or things are going
01:27:25.12 --> 01:27:29.12 good. You're hiring new people with growth or whatever, whatever your situation. And it's like
01:27:29.12 --> 01:27:33.12 saying this guy, so I'm so glad I heard this guy, but when something goes wrong, they self-destruct.
01:27:33.12 --> 01:27:36.96 There's something like that. Man, yeah, that's, I think, a critical component.
01:27:36.96 --> 01:27:43.84 And so I, you know, the simple answer is that there's, there's so many different variables.
01:27:44.72 --> 01:27:49.36 So many different nuances that what you want to do is you want to know your people.
01:27:49.36 --> 01:27:53.92 Yeah. You want to build relationships with your people so you know them so you understand them.
01:27:53.92 --> 01:27:58.08 That's what you want to do. Yeah. The R word relationships.
01:28:00.40 --> 01:28:05.84 Yeah, that's what you need. That's how you get to know your people. And that's how you
01:28:05.84 --> 01:28:15.60 lead them correctly. Next question. In regards to subordinate leadership, how do you begin to
01:28:15.60 --> 01:28:20.000 change the culture slash school of thought of an industry or a company?
01:28:24.72 --> 01:28:28.64 You know, I'm not sure if they mean in regards to how do you change your subordinate
01:28:28.64 --> 01:28:33.28 leaderships or if you are subordinate. I'm not sure what which one of those it is, but
01:28:33.28 --> 01:28:38.64 regardless, it doesn't matter because guess what I'm going to do. I'm going to lead. That's what
01:28:38.64 --> 01:28:44.64 I'm going to do. Whether I'm on whether I'm the subordinate guy or the superior guy, I'm going to
01:28:44.64 --> 01:28:49.04 lead. Oh, we're going to, I want to change things and make them a certain way cool. I'm going to do those
01:28:49.04 --> 01:28:55.12 things. I'm going to make those things happen. That's how you do it. And if you're doing the right
01:28:55.12 --> 01:29:01.92 things for the right reasons, your message is going to spread. You know, how many bad
01:29:01.92 --> 01:29:09.52 school platoons I was in? I'm in zero. You know why? Because me and my buddies, we always had a good
01:29:09.52 --> 01:29:14.000 attitude. We always had the right attitude and that spread to the other people that were with us.
01:29:17.12 --> 01:29:27.44 Now, there's a red flag that you can get for yourself. And this is frustration. When you
01:29:27.44 --> 01:29:33.28 start saying yourself, which I'm not saying this necessarily, but this kind of question is coming
01:29:33.28 --> 01:29:37.36 from somebody that wants changed to happen, but it's not happening. So they're getting frustrated
01:29:37.36 --> 01:29:43.92 and they're thinking, they are not bored. They don't care. They aren't professional. They're not motivated
01:29:43.92 --> 01:29:53.28 like me. They don't have a good attitude. So there's a lot of blame going on right there. So this
01:29:53.28 --> 01:30:03.28 isn't about them, though. It's about you. And it's about leading from any level in the chain of command.
01:30:03.28 --> 01:30:10.32 If you're leading, if you're doing the right things, forward the right reasons, that's going to
01:30:10.32 --> 01:30:15.36 spread. So when the classic example I talk about it all the time is if your exercise in the
01:30:15.36 --> 01:30:19.76 extreme ownership, if you're saying, you know what? I got this. There was some stake made. It was my fault.
01:30:19.76 --> 01:30:30.16 That spreads. If you're humble, that spreads. If you have an open mind, that spreads.
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.08 If you're being aggressive, not again, not aggressive towards other people, but if you're being
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:44.40 aggressive in pursuit of your goal, that spreads. You know what doesn't spread is when you're
01:30:44.40 --> 01:30:50.32 aggressive at people. Oh, I'll actually, it does spread, but it's negative. You know what doesn't
01:30:50.32 --> 01:30:53.52 spread? It doesn't spread when you're trying to get people to do things because it's going to
01:30:53.52 --> 01:31:00.24 make you look good. That doesn't spread. You can't get people to behave better because you want to
01:31:00.24 --> 01:31:06.32 look good. It doesn't work. People see right through that. Oh, he wants to look good. You know what I'm
01:31:06.32 --> 01:31:16.000 going to do? Sabotage. Now the other thing I've been saying lately, because people are
01:31:17.76 --> 01:31:24.32 surprised or whatever, or not surprised, but they're concerned. They don't see how it's going to
01:31:24.32 --> 01:31:29.76 work so fast. And I say, you know what, it's not going to work fast. It's got to be, and here's the
01:31:29.76 --> 01:31:36.08 word. It's got to be a campaign. It's got to be a campaign. It's not like World War II was not one
01:31:36.08 --> 01:31:43.12 battle. World War I was not one battle. It's a campaign to win in Europe. It's a campaign to win
01:31:43.12 --> 01:31:48.000 in the Pacific. It takes battle after battle, after battle. And guess what, you don't win them all.
01:31:49.20 --> 01:31:53.68 You lose some of them. And so you're going to, on this campaign, you're going to win and you're
01:31:53.68 --> 01:32:01.20 going to lose. But you got to have the persistence and the patience and the persuasiveness to continue.
01:32:01.20 --> 01:32:17.28 And another piece of this is, you are best off if you go indirect and not be like, hey, you need to
01:32:17.28 --> 01:32:26.88 act like me. No. People don't like that. You need to just act how you're acting. And if you're doing it,
01:32:26.88 --> 01:32:32.40 like I said, the right things for the right reasons, people are going to see you and they're going to follow.
01:32:36.80 --> 01:32:43.20 So that's how you begin to change the school of thought. Yeah, that genuineness, like,
01:32:43.20 --> 01:32:47.68 tends to show itself or that, like, if you're not genuine, it tends to show itself. You know,
01:32:47.68 --> 01:32:51.20 just because of the dynamics of any of your words. That's what my words do. It just,
01:32:51.20 --> 01:32:55.92 straight shows itself. So when you're doing it for the right reasons, like you can't help but
01:32:55.92 --> 01:33:00.80 expose that, you know, that will be exposed. So yeah, people will sign on sign right on. And then
01:33:00.80 --> 01:33:04.56 you end up gaining, like, how you say, it's a campaign. It's like, you'll gain a little bit of
01:33:04.56 --> 01:33:08.96 ground. You might win this guy over. Like, hey, wait, that's, you know, that's a cool way of doing it or
01:33:08.96 --> 01:33:14.16 you know, whatever the group is. And you make these small little steps. You kind of hold that
01:33:14.16 --> 01:33:17.60 ground. And yeah, before you know it, it's kind of dang the whole culture of this, I don't know
01:33:17.60 --> 01:33:24.80 office or whatever. It's kind of changing. You know, it just, that happens. It's true. I've seen it happen.
01:33:26.56 --> 01:33:27.20 Next question.
01:33:29.68 --> 01:33:35.36 Jocco Echo, how do you work with people who overthink things?
01:33:37.68 --> 01:33:44.08 The classic overthinker. What does that mean? The overthinkers? They won't pick up this pan right
01:33:44.08 --> 01:33:50.56 here because they look at and say, hmm, I wonder what the way to that pan is. And if I should pick
01:33:50.56 --> 01:33:54.48 it up right now because I'm also thinking about saying something and what if I drop the pan
01:33:54.48 --> 01:33:58.08 while I'm trying to say something that makes a noise on the desk that disrupts from the flow of my
01:33:58.08 --> 01:34:03.28 sentence. And then the whole flow of my sentence is disrupted, which means my train of thought will
01:34:03.28 --> 01:34:08.88 be disrupted. Now I can't, we're finished when I was going to say that's an overthinker. So that's
01:34:08.88 --> 01:34:14.24 first of all, now you can just imagine applying that thought pattern to an actual project that you're working on.
01:34:14.24 --> 01:34:18.96 Right, right. Not a good scenario or you're trying to apply it to a combat situation that you're in.
01:34:18.96 --> 01:34:23.20 Or you're trying to apply it to a relationship that you're in. You start overthinking. Well,
01:34:23.20 --> 01:34:27.04 I see this and she might think that. Right. Yeah. They mean that. Yeah. That little book.
01:34:27.04 --> 01:34:34.16 But yes, yes. Yeah. That's true. Okay. That's an overthinker. So quit thinking so much. You're overthinking
01:34:34.16 --> 01:34:39.84 it. So here's what I do when someone's overthinking where I got someone that's like a like a
01:34:39.84 --> 01:34:49.76 chronic overthinker. I'm gonna, I'm gonna funnel them into the right mindset with questions and
01:34:49.76 --> 01:34:55.68 I'll give you some real easy questions to ask that'll make this happen. Things like, hey, we mean by that
01:34:57.04 --> 01:35:01.92 or like, can you explain that again? And you're getting them to explain it in a simpler way.
01:35:01.92 --> 01:35:07.68 Okay. Or you say, you know, hey, so hold on. So what's the actual goal? Do we try to get done here?
01:35:08.48 --> 01:35:13.36 Because again, they're putting layers upon layers of complexity on top of things that don't
01:35:13.36 --> 01:35:19.04 deserve it. So what exactly are we trying to do? And again, you're just kind of playing dumb a
01:35:19.04 --> 01:35:26.72 little bit and asking questions. And then if you can't get to them, if you can't quite get them to
01:35:26.72 --> 01:35:33.92 simplify it, then you say, oh, okay. So we're trying to do this very simple statement. So
01:35:33.92 --> 01:35:41.52 so that way they start subconsciously being coached and being taught to simplify things as much as
01:35:41.52 --> 01:35:48.08 they can in their head. And you know, another thing I've been saying lately, when I'm out
01:35:48.08 --> 01:35:56.64 working with people is I used to not really understand why people are drawn to this complexity
01:35:56.64 --> 01:36:03.36 but I actually think I understand now. And I think it has something to do with the fact that
01:36:03.92 --> 01:36:08.88 if I come up with a plan and it's super complex and super crazy and you don't understand it,
01:36:08.88 --> 01:36:16.000 then I must be smarter than you, right? Yeah. Right? I came up with something that's so genius and so
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:22.08 complicated that you don't even understand it. I understand it. I understand it. Yeah, like what you
01:36:22.08 --> 01:36:27.04 do in it, right? And by the way, you know the only way you're going to understand it if I
01:36:27.04 --> 01:36:34.16 is if I break it down for you because you don't get it. So it's an ego trip and it's completely wrong.
01:36:34.16 --> 01:36:38.40 Because the fact of the matter is if I'm trying to get you to do something and you don't understand it,
01:36:38.40 --> 01:36:48.000 I'm a loser. I'm failing as a leader. So you, you, you got to try and get people to understand
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:56.08 that simplicity beats complexity every single time and overthinking things is a failure in ability
01:36:56.08 --> 01:37:03.84 to simplify. So another thing and this is more kind of about planning and this is something I used
01:37:03.84 --> 01:37:10.64 to talk about in the SEAL teams and I call it 6% advantage over the enemy. And what this was was
01:37:11.84 --> 01:37:15.20 let's say you have a target building that you're going off of or going after you're going to
01:37:15.20 --> 01:37:19.92 go take down a target building in the middle of wherever the middle of the desert. And you basically
01:37:19.92 --> 01:37:23.36 come up with a plan that you're going to use your standard operating procedures. You're all going
01:37:23.36 --> 01:37:28.32 to get online or you're going to at least set up a base in a maneuver element. It's very simple. Two
01:37:28.32 --> 01:37:32.40 elements, one element is going to hold cover and the other one is going to move through the target.
01:37:32.40 --> 01:37:37.84 Cover and move. It's a simple as it gets. That's great. So you come up with a plan that's your plan.
01:37:37.84 --> 01:37:42.32 And then as you're looking at the imagery or you're looking at the map, you notice that there is an
01:37:42.32 --> 01:37:51.04 outhouse. 150 meters away from the house. So now what you do is you go, you know what?
01:37:51.84 --> 01:37:54.80 Because there's that outhouse there. You know what I'm going to do is I'm going to take another
01:37:54.80 --> 01:37:58.16 team of our guys. We're going to break them off from the main assault force. We're going to put them
01:37:58.16 --> 01:38:04.64 over there. And that's what they're going to be in case the guys in the outhouse bubble. So what
01:38:04.64 --> 01:38:09.92 you've done is you've separated your units. You've increased your communication problems. You've
01:38:09.92 --> 01:38:15.12 sacrificed your fields of fire. You disaggregated your fire power. You've diminished your unity
01:38:15.12 --> 01:38:20.000 of command. You've broke from your standard operating procedures. You've given up your real
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:28.40 tactical advantage that you have for the chance. The chance that this guy at two o'clock in the
01:38:28.40 --> 01:38:34.64 morning when you hit the target is in the outhouse and not in his home. Is it worth that? No.
01:38:34.64 --> 01:38:40.88 So don't overthink it. We're hitting this target. You know what? Cool. He buys on that thing.
01:38:41.92 --> 01:38:47.12 No big deal. But don't give up your tactical advantage because you overthought the situation.
01:38:48.24 --> 01:38:58.16 Go with what you know. And another piece of that is a lot of times when people get super
01:38:58.16 --> 01:39:03.68 detailed like that and planning. They're actually planning things, planning on things that
01:39:03.68 --> 01:39:10.32 can't be known. So why would we make a plan for something that can't be known?
01:39:11.44 --> 01:39:16.24 I got a better idea instead of making a plan for something that can't be known. Make a plan. That's
01:39:16.24 --> 01:39:23.28 adaptable. You want your plan to be adaptable. And you know how you have the best adaptability
01:39:23.28 --> 01:39:26.72 for instance on the battlefield that you have the most control over your guys so that you can
01:39:26.72 --> 01:39:31.12 move them maneuver them quickly and how do you do that by having good unity of command and how
01:39:31.12 --> 01:39:37.04 do that by keeping your guys for the most part together. The many you start spreading them out all over
01:39:37.04 --> 01:39:43.12 the place and something changes. Something unknown that unexpected happens. Now you got to
01:39:43.12 --> 01:39:50.64 real everyone back in and try and get them to change the formation of their assault. It becomes
01:39:50.64 --> 01:40:00.24 very very complex. So if you set up your plan so that it's adaptable to changing situations,
01:40:00.24 --> 01:40:08.16 then you're going to be good to go. Same thing in business. Do you know what the market's going to
01:40:08.16 --> 01:40:16.40 do? No. We have predictors. Yes. Do we know them? No. Do you know what your competitor is going to do?
01:40:16.40 --> 01:40:23.44 No. Do you know what your consumers are going to do? No. Do we have intelligence? Of course we
01:40:23.44 --> 01:40:30.000 do. Do we have metrics? Of course we do but we don't know things. So keep your plans adaptable.
01:40:30.80 --> 01:40:39.36 So you can make adjustments when you need to. As opposed to overthinking things and creating
01:40:39.36 --> 01:40:45.76 specific branch plans for a possibility of something that might occur in the future or might not.
01:40:45.76 --> 01:40:59.60 Don't overthink it people. Sometimes people who underthink things. Sometimes they tend to say,
01:40:59.60 --> 01:41:06.16 hey, why do you overthink things when you're just normally thinking about something? Like you're thinking about
01:41:06.16 --> 01:41:11.28 something. Oh, so you're familiar. Yeah. So there's obviously you have to think about things. Right.
01:41:11.28 --> 01:41:16.08 And yes, you should be caution of someone cautious of someone that's just constantly saying,
01:41:17.04 --> 01:41:24.48 man, you're overthinking this. Right. That's been three minutes planning. Yeah. Watch out for that guy.
01:41:25.36 --> 01:41:33.60 Yeah. That's why you have one the word open overthinking comes up. Understand what that means.
01:41:33.60 --> 01:41:44.80 But I feel like your example is sound. Juggle. What do you think of Greg Jackson?
01:41:44.80 --> 01:41:50.88 That M. M. F. Famous M. M. Coach criticizing John Jones on his recent powerlifting and muscle
01:41:50.88 --> 01:41:58.48 gain. Yeah. So if you didn't see this if you're into M. M. M. May it all, they caught Greg Jackson on the
01:41:58.48 --> 01:42:06.32 mic after John Jones's recent fight saying, you know, basically, hey, I told you so. He's too big.
01:42:06.32 --> 01:42:14.48 He's all that powerlifting. And I've talked about Greg Jackson before and nothing but respect for
01:42:14.48 --> 01:42:22.48 Greg Jackson. Not only is he an outstanding coach and a great tactician, he's also just super humble guy
01:42:22.48 --> 01:42:30.72 who has built a really cool gym and built a lot of champions. So his record speeds for itself.
01:42:32.56 --> 01:42:37.68 So I'm not going to second guess, you know, what he's saying about a fighter that he's worked with
01:42:37.68 --> 01:42:44.40 since day one. And I think really it boils down to this sort of definition of perfection. If you've
01:42:44.40 --> 01:42:49.60 ever heard this definition of the definition of perfection is when you have nothing more to add
01:42:49.60 --> 01:42:57.04 and nothing more to take away. You've got it where it needs to be. And they use this with design,
01:42:57.68 --> 01:43:03.36 you know, design of whatever furniture of iPhones of, you know, anything, buildings.
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.12 When you've got everything that needs to be there and you can't take anything away, that's the
01:43:09.12 --> 01:43:14.08 that's perfection. They say this about writing too. And you look at someone that writes really well
01:43:14.08 --> 01:43:20.64 every sentence you look at that sentence, you can't take away a word and you can't add a word.
01:43:21.36 --> 01:43:28.32 And that's perfection. And I think that is what Greg Jackson is trying to do with Johnny Bones Jones.
01:43:28.32 --> 01:43:35.76 Get him in that physical status where you don't want to add anything and you don't want to take
01:43:35.76 --> 01:43:42.48 anything away. So what they may have done according to Greg Jackson is they may have added a little
01:43:42.48 --> 01:43:49.04 too much muscle because of course you've got to have some muscle because it gives you strength
01:43:49.04 --> 01:43:59.04 that's in the explosiveness. But at the same time, muscle requires oxygen. And so you can actually
01:43:59.04 --> 01:44:05.52 get too big to where it's affecting your cardio. So I think that's all Greg Jackson was talking
01:44:05.52 --> 01:44:10.48 about it. And I think that's the balance that I'm always looking for. You know, I want to be
01:44:10.48 --> 01:44:14.48 big and strong enough, but I want to have endurance. That's what I'm trying to do. You know,
01:44:15.28 --> 01:44:20.08 and I try and find that balance by doing both strength work and endurance work. That's
01:44:20.08 --> 01:44:23.92 and when I say endurance, I mean muscular endurance. I don't mean marathon running because I don't
01:44:23.92 --> 01:44:30.16 run marathon's. Metcon. Metcon's, baby. So that's what I think he's talking about. And
01:44:30.88 --> 01:44:36.16 you know, like I said, respect for Greg Jackson and I'm sure that he had a
01:44:36.16 --> 01:44:42.56 he's got a good hand along why he's saying that. Yeah, fully. And when you, I do know a little
01:44:42.56 --> 01:44:50.72 about a little bit about this where, um, so if you gain some a bunch of muscle, fast like a
01:44:50.72 --> 01:44:54.88 short period of period of time, you can have a way harder time dealing with, you know, the
01:44:54.88 --> 01:45:01.20 drawbacks of that muscle. And that is endurance. That's the main thing. And at the same time, this
01:45:01.20 --> 01:45:05.52 doesn't have much to do with this particular situation. But if you gain muscle real fast, you
01:45:05.52 --> 01:45:10.24 can lose it. You have the potential to lose it real fast. But at the same time, you
01:45:10.24 --> 01:45:17.44 vice versa. If you cultivate this, you know, muscular body build, whatever, um, over time,
01:45:17.44 --> 01:45:21.20 like let's say you started lifting at 15 years old and you're, you know, 35 years old now.
01:45:22.16 --> 01:45:28.48 And you've always been muscular. Your body will have a, easier time holding onto that
01:45:28.48 --> 01:45:33.04 one for sure. If you stop like lifting for even a year, or if you stop lifting for a long time
01:45:33.04 --> 01:45:37.12 and then you get back to lifting, it'll, it'll jump right back up as far as your muscular,
01:45:37.12 --> 01:45:46.56 muscular muscularity. So, in regards to endurance, no matter what, bigger muscles require
01:45:46.56 --> 01:45:52.16 more oxygen, more fuel. So it's harder to get that endurance out when you have big muscles,
01:45:52.16 --> 01:45:57.20 just in general. But you're going to have the potential to gain that endurance way more if you've
01:45:57.20 --> 01:46:02.48 had muscle for a long time. So you do these big jumps in muscle gain, man, that endurance is going
01:46:02.48 --> 01:46:06.08 to suffer. It's going to be really hard to build up that endurance really hard. I'm not saying
01:46:06.08 --> 01:46:12.56 impossible, but it's just really, really hard. Yeah. So yeah, that is a dangerous thing, not dangerous,
01:46:12.56 --> 01:46:17.44 but it's, it's a, it's risky thing to do when, you know, I'm going to jump back into the fighting
01:46:17.44 --> 01:46:23.44 situation and I'm huge now. You know, I got that endurance weight stuff around that one. And,
01:46:23.44 --> 01:46:31.12 you know, obviously, or apparently it did there. Like, we, uh, maybe do one more
01:46:31.12 --> 01:46:39.76 here. Okay. Jockel, do you ever feel like Cicophys pushing a rock up a hill, only to watch it
01:46:39.76 --> 01:46:51.52 roll back down again and have to do it again. How do you overcome that? Do I ever feel like Cicophys?
01:46:51.52 --> 01:47:08.48 Yeah. Of course I do. I mean, I do. And I'll tell you, I've, I've thought about this and I've
01:47:08.48 --> 01:47:13.28 been waiting for people to start saying like, oh, you put another picture of the sweat and
01:47:13.28 --> 01:47:25.84 of a squat rack really, but I don't know if they understand. I've been getting on that squat
01:47:25.84 --> 01:47:40.56 rack and grinding it out for 25 years. And I'm not bored with it yet. It might seem like that's an
01:47:40.56 --> 01:47:56.56 unwindable battle, but really to me, it's not about winning. It's the battle itself. It's the struggle.
01:47:56.56 --> 01:48:04.96 It's the daily test. That's what life's about. Not just physically, but mentally.
01:48:04.96 --> 01:48:13.60 Getting that rock to the top of the mountain. That's not what my goal is.
01:48:15.68 --> 01:48:22.88 My goal actually is pushing the rock because pushing the rock
01:48:22.88 --> 01:48:34.08 pushes me. That makes me tougher. That makes me harder mentally and physically.
01:48:37.28 --> 01:48:46.48 It gives me much more than I give it. I want a struggle. I want a grinding claw and scratch.
01:48:46.48 --> 01:48:56.64 I want a digging and I want a push. And I don't want it to end. If I ever got the rock to the top
01:48:56.64 --> 01:49:07.68 of the mountain and it stayed there, I'd push it back down myself. I don't want to rest and
01:49:07.68 --> 01:49:17.76 I don't want a coast. And then I want to reach a point in my life where I say, that's it. I've done enough.
01:49:19.60 --> 01:49:23.84 I'm not going to give any more. I'm not going to push anymore.
01:49:27.28 --> 01:49:30.88 No. No.
01:49:30.88 --> 01:49:42.40 That relentless cycle of day to day challenges. They are madening to me. They don't frustrate
01:49:42.40 --> 01:49:50.72 me. They inspire me. Inspire me to drive and push more and to push harder.
01:49:53.52 --> 01:49:55.04 That's what that rock does to me.
01:49:55.04 --> 01:50:16.08 So why I say dig in and get to push and I think that's all I've got for tonight.
