00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.80 This is Jocco podcast number 84 with echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:09.80 Good evening echo.
00:00:09.80 --> 00:00:14.08 Good evening.
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:21.72 Gentlemen, your life expectancy from the day you join your battalion will be precisely
00:00:21.72 --> 00:00:24.68 three weeks.
00:00:24.68 --> 00:00:31.08 The Florida mustache major who addressed us at the small reinforcement camp a few miles
00:00:31.08 --> 00:00:36.68 from Bayou obviously had misplaced how to misplace sense of humor.
00:00:36.68 --> 00:00:39.08 Or he should have been sacked.
00:00:39.08 --> 00:00:42.96 On second thought, he definitely should have been sacked.
00:00:42.96 --> 00:00:49.28 Not that any of the dozen infantry subalterns took the slightest notice of what to us with
00:00:49.28 --> 00:00:56.28 the ramblings of an old fool. He was probably no more than 40.
00:00:56.28 --> 00:01:03.08 The fourth battalion, the summer set light infantry was in one twenty nine brigade and
00:01:03.08 --> 00:01:11.76 was a pre-war territorial army battalion with close links with Bristol and Bath.
00:01:11.76 --> 00:01:21.26 In the United Kingdom till late June 1944 it was a close knit unit which had almost been
00:01:21.26 --> 00:01:26.16 decimated within a period of 48 hours.
00:01:26.16 --> 00:01:34.52 On fifth of July, three officers and 62 other ranks were required as reinforcements.
00:01:34.52 --> 00:01:41.64 Between the 14th and the 18th of July, a further 12 officers of whom I was one and
00:01:41.64 --> 00:01:50.20 479 other ranks arrived and even then the battalion was still below its full strength of 36
00:01:50.20 --> 00:01:55.96 officers and nearly 700 NCOs and men.
00:01:55.96 --> 00:02:01.24 This will give some idea of the appalling level of infantry casualties which had to be
00:02:01.24 --> 00:02:09.76 accepted in order to enlarge the slender and vulnerable Normandy beachhead.
00:02:09.76 --> 00:02:16.20 As I had the had had previous experience of six pounder anti tank guns, the commanding
00:02:16.20 --> 00:02:22.96 officer, Lippi, Lieutenant Colonel C. G. Lipscomb, posted me as second in command to the
00:02:22.96 --> 00:02:28.16 battalion's anti tank platoon which consisted of six guns.
00:02:28.16 --> 00:02:33.08 But my stay with that platoon was short and I was quickly sucked into the real infantry
00:02:33.08 --> 00:02:40.96 battle as commander of 18 platoon in D company on the 31st of July immediately after the
00:02:40.96 --> 00:02:48.24 battle of Briskersarred D company had just lost their commander Tim Brathweigh, lost a
00:02:48.24 --> 00:02:58.60 foot and gained a military cross and 18 platoon their commander.
00:02:58.60 --> 00:03:05.44 So that right there is the beginning of a book that we're going to look at today.
00:03:05.44 --> 00:03:07.52 It's called 18 platoon.
00:03:07.52 --> 00:03:17.36 It's written by a guy named Sydney Jerry, J.A.R. Y. who was born in Essex in 1924.
00:03:17.36 --> 00:03:27.40 When the army in 1942 was a private soldier in 1943 he was commissioned and from 19 from July
00:03:27.40 --> 00:03:35.68 of 1944 until June of 1945 he served as the platoon commander for 18 platoon.
00:03:35.68 --> 00:03:45.56 And the chances of survival for an infantry subaltern in a rifle company during the
00:03:45.56 --> 00:03:51.92 campaign in northwest Europe or slim most survived for only a few weeks.
00:03:51.92 --> 00:03:59.86 Sydney Jerry survived 10 months from July 1944 when he took command of 18 platoon in
00:03:59.86 --> 00:04:06.32 Normandy until the end of the war near Bremen in early May of 1945.
00:04:06.32 --> 00:04:15.04 So this guy this is this is amazing this guy, Sydney Jerry he's the only platoon commander
00:04:15.04 --> 00:04:22.84 in the British second army to survive as a platoon commander from Normandy to the German
00:04:22.84 --> 00:04:30.60 surrender one guy, one guy, and this is the guy.
00:04:30.60 --> 00:04:39.04 It's amazing and you're going to see that his attitude is I mean the lessons that he learned
00:04:39.04 --> 00:04:44.28 he was young coming in he was 20 years old 20-year old platoon commander coming in in
00:04:44.28 --> 00:04:48.32 the experience kind of lived a sheltered life you got to check out some pictures of him
00:04:48.32 --> 00:04:53.76 he has that look to he looks like you know sheltered looks like a little young whipper
00:04:53.76 --> 00:04:56.76 snapper.
00:04:56.76 --> 00:05:01.96 So we'll go back to the book here as he breaks down what a platoon was at this time.
00:05:01.96 --> 00:05:06.96 In 1944 the war establishment of a British infantry platoon was 36 men.
00:05:06.96 --> 00:05:11.52 It consisted of three rifle sections each of 10 men including a bread gunner each
00:05:11.52 --> 00:05:16.56 commanded by a corpel or sometimes a land sergeant there was also a small platoon head
00:05:16.56 --> 00:05:25.24 quarters with a two inch mortar detachment a p-out which was of anti tank weapon.
00:05:25.24 --> 00:05:36.60 The platoon sergeant and the commanders Batman slash runner on July 31st 18 platoon consisted
00:05:36.60 --> 00:05:42.56 of 17 all ranks 12 of whom were recent reinforcements.
00:05:42.56 --> 00:05:48.92 He'll one 12 and brick cigar had claimed the rest.
00:05:48.92 --> 00:05:56.28 So think about that you're supposed to have 36 people in your platoon and they have 17
00:05:56.28 --> 00:06:04.96 of which 12 are replacements which means that 29 people had been casualties.
00:06:04.96 --> 00:06:08.04 There's seven people that had been either killed or wounded.
00:06:08.04 --> 00:06:11.84 There's sorry seven people out of this 36 that hadn't been killed or wounded that remained
00:06:11.84 --> 00:06:13.12 in the platoon right now.
00:06:13.12 --> 00:06:16.92 So that's what we're talking about here.
00:06:16.92 --> 00:06:19.92 And again he's coming in no combat experience.
00:06:19.92 --> 00:06:21.28 He rolls in and we're going back to the book.
00:06:21.28 --> 00:06:29.000 I sensed instantly that a tight grip was required particularly so because those few who survived
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.60 till one 12 had witnessed what was without a doubt the most horrific tragedy that befell
00:06:35.60 --> 00:06:42.20 the battalion during the entire campaign.
00:06:42.20 --> 00:06:44.08 So he's about to explain what they had been through.
00:06:44.08 --> 00:06:47.96 He wasn't there for it but he knew and he had heard what they had been through.
00:06:47.96 --> 00:06:52.76 And I'm going to say that again this is the most horrific tragedy for the entire campaign.
00:06:52.76 --> 00:06:55.76 This is what they're coming off of and this is who he's going to take over for.
00:06:55.76 --> 00:06:57.48 This is what they had been through.
00:06:57.48 --> 00:07:02.40 Back to the book during a company night attack one of our soldiers had been hit in the lower
00:07:02.40 --> 00:07:06.000 chest by a rifle or machine gun bullet.
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.20 Passing through his body it had not killed him outright.
00:07:10.20 --> 00:07:16.32 The bullets devilish course lay through the soldiers webbing equipment pouch which contained
00:07:16.32 --> 00:07:23.72 a 77 phosphorus smoke grenade which exploded.
00:07:23.72 --> 00:07:31.16 But on barbed wire the poor soldier laid disemboweled for all around to see his writhing body
00:07:31.16 --> 00:07:37.64 a smoking mass of burning phosphorus.
00:07:37.64 --> 00:07:43.64 Responding to his agonized screams to put him out of his misery his platoon commander shot
00:07:43.64 --> 00:07:46.84 him through the heart.
00:07:46.84 --> 00:07:53.20 And finally through the head after the poor man's final frenzyed pleas.
00:07:53.20 --> 00:08:00.80 Their sir through the head.
00:08:00.80 --> 00:08:07.32 Doug Proctor was witness to this sublimely courageous incident which seared itself upon all
00:08:07.32 --> 00:08:13.32 our hearts.
00:08:13.32 --> 00:08:15.76 So that's what you're going to take over for.
00:08:15.76 --> 00:08:17.76 Can you do that?
00:08:17.76 --> 00:08:22.48 I mean is that like legal you know like if they found out that that happened.
00:08:22.48 --> 00:08:26.68 I have no idea what the legal ramifications are.
00:08:26.68 --> 00:08:36.40 But the moral weight on the shoulders of the men that witness that is unbelievably.
00:08:36.40 --> 00:08:43.000 It's hard to imagine what that feels like.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.44 Back to the book to the NCOs.
00:08:45.44 --> 00:08:51.40 Sergeant Jim Kingston and Corporal Doug Proctor immediately reported to me and explained
00:08:51.40 --> 00:08:56.04 that forcefully and in great detail the poor stayed the platoon as they knew it to be.
00:08:56.04 --> 00:09:00.60 So you've got these guys these are the senior enlisted guys in the platoon Jim Kingston
00:09:00.60 --> 00:09:03.28 and Doug Proctor and you're going to hear a lot about them.
00:09:03.28 --> 00:09:04.28 And they're coming to him.
00:09:04.28 --> 00:09:07.52 Here's this new guy checking in and they're coming to him and they're you know telling
00:09:07.52 --> 00:09:12.24 him how what what a bad state the platoon is in.
00:09:12.24 --> 00:09:16.68 Back to the book while they did so I was conscious of being weighed up was I fit to be
00:09:16.68 --> 00:09:18.64 their platoon commander.
00:09:18.64 --> 00:09:24.44 They were responsible anxious and discriminating NCOs that stands for non-commissioned officer.
00:09:24.44 --> 00:09:31.000 It's the senior enlisted guys and my apprenticeship was to start immediately.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.84 They were startled by my attire previously warned by a young officer who'd fought in
00:09:35.84 --> 00:09:41.000 Tunisia that battle dress was most unsuitable for brat battle.
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.44 I'd come prepared and sand colored corduroy trousers and a stout pullover not unlike that
00:09:46.44 --> 00:09:49.28 now warned throughout the army.
00:09:49.28 --> 00:09:54.96 Among my prejudices was an acute dislike of steel helmets they gave me headaches.
00:09:54.96 --> 00:10:00.16 On exercises in England I had been obliged to wear one but the surge of individualism
00:10:00.16 --> 00:10:04.56 which now engulfed me convinced me that this was an article of equipment best left out
00:10:04.56 --> 00:10:06.52 of battle.
00:10:06.52 --> 00:10:10.12 So he's he shows up and he's kind of dressed out of uniform.
00:10:10.12 --> 00:10:14.32 Doesn't want to wear his helmet wearing corduroy pants.
00:10:14.32 --> 00:10:18.08 Back to the book Battle School's in England had insisted that off infantry officers should
00:10:18.08 --> 00:10:22.92 wear the same equipment and dress as their soldiers the idea being that they could not
00:10:22.92 --> 00:10:27.52 be then be so easily identified by enemy snipers.
00:10:27.52 --> 00:10:32.44 They also decreed that one should carry a rifle or a stand gun.
00:10:32.44 --> 00:10:34.28 Clearly this was ridiculous.
00:10:34.28 --> 00:10:38.32 How on earth could your own soldiers recognize you in the heat of battle if you went through
00:10:38.32 --> 00:10:40.16 such lengths to disguise?
00:10:40.16 --> 00:10:46.48 He had the same attitude as Lieutenant Lee in Korea that was wearing the orange vest you
00:10:46.48 --> 00:10:48.48 remember that?
00:10:48.48 --> 00:10:52.52 So he could be identified in battle by his own men.
00:10:52.52 --> 00:10:54.60 That's what this guy's attitude is like I'm not going to dress like everyone else
00:10:54.60 --> 00:10:57.56 they need to beat they need to know who that I'm out there.
00:10:57.56 --> 00:10:59.48 They need to be able to see me.
00:10:59.48 --> 00:11:00.48 Back to the book.
00:11:00.48 --> 00:11:05.48 I dispense with the rifle or stand gun too because I'm hopelessly short sighted and I did
00:11:05.48 --> 00:11:10.96 not fancy trying to command a platoon while got up like a Christmas tree meaning covered
00:11:10.96 --> 00:11:12.36 in a bunch of gear.
00:11:12.36 --> 00:11:17.56 As a concession to impending battle I sported a 45-colt automatic pistol with two spare
00:11:17.56 --> 00:11:20.20 magazines.
00:11:20.20 --> 00:11:24.32 The 38-n field revolver then general issue throughout the army managed to combine total
00:11:24.32 --> 00:11:26.92 mechanical liability with complete ineffectiveness.
00:11:26.92 --> 00:11:34.68 I once fired chick shots from one at a target pinned to a plywood board none of which even
00:11:34.68 --> 00:11:37.32 penetrated the board.
00:11:37.32 --> 00:11:40.68 Neither did I hit the target which gave me little confidence in this weapon.
00:11:40.68 --> 00:11:44.28 The nine pounds I paid for the cult proved a sound investment.
00:11:44.28 --> 00:11:50.12 So there's a lot of people that like to talk about what type of side arm there you've got
00:11:50.12 --> 00:11:56.40 a big proponent for the cult 45 the old classic.
00:11:56.40 --> 00:12:00.40 Again important to remember that he's not even carrying a rifle because he knows his job
00:12:00.40 --> 00:12:06.20 of sleep and I used to do it when we had seals seal leaders that would spend too much
00:12:06.20 --> 00:12:07.68 time on their gun.
00:12:07.68 --> 00:12:11.04 I would say hey you know what they used to carry in the Marine Corps in the army.
00:12:11.04 --> 00:12:14.48 If you were leader you know what they'd carry the carry a pistol.
00:12:14.48 --> 00:12:16.52 So give me your rifle and we take it from them.
00:12:16.52 --> 00:12:20.92 You need to be leading not shooting.
00:12:20.92 --> 00:12:22.56 Lave talks about that a lot.
00:12:22.56 --> 00:12:27.52 Yeah it's very you know Lave talks about his mentality which was he wants to shoot.
00:12:27.52 --> 00:12:29.32 He's from Texas.
00:12:29.32 --> 00:12:33.64 You know he wants to shoot his gun and he realized hey I'm not here to shoot my gun.
00:12:33.64 --> 00:12:38.40 I'm here to you know be at high port and be off my gun and leading.
00:12:38.40 --> 00:12:44.64 That's my job and these guys took it to the point where they're not even carrying a rifle.
00:12:44.64 --> 00:12:47.56 Now he's talking about a senior leadership a little bit his enlisted leadership.
00:12:47.56 --> 00:12:53.24 Back to the book Jim Kingston was short, quiet and shy with the shootness of a countryman
00:12:53.24 --> 00:12:57.28 although he had lived and worked in Bristol all his life.
00:12:57.28 --> 00:13:02.60 He barely raised his voice but had total command over his section.
00:13:02.60 --> 00:13:07.32 There was no argument with Jim that that's another thing you'd find about this book.
00:13:07.32 --> 00:13:14.68 This book it it it takes so many stereotypes from from from Sydney Jerry on down like
00:13:14.68 --> 00:13:18.76 the stereotypes are just out the window of the way this between was and there's a classic
00:13:18.76 --> 00:13:23.96 example you know you picture the senior listed guy this you know gunny highway scenario
00:13:23.96 --> 00:13:26.24 not happening.
00:13:26.24 --> 00:13:31.000 Now he talks about Doug Proctor back to the book Doug Proctor although a summer set came from
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.12 notting him.
00:13:33.12 --> 00:13:39.36 Also short he was positive direct with unfailing common sense and like Jim quietly
00:13:39.36 --> 00:13:42.64 dominated his section.
00:13:42.64 --> 00:13:46.32 So there's another and I got to see some great leaders.
00:13:46.32 --> 00:13:50.16 There's some guys that were in where in to you bruiser that were quiet when they were
00:13:50.16 --> 00:13:55.44 in to you bruiser and when I was putting them through their next workup I was thinking
00:13:55.44 --> 00:13:58.48 myself hey are they going to be able to step up and lead and that's exactly how they did
00:13:58.48 --> 00:14:04.88 it right there they were just like quiet professional and controlling but they run their
00:14:04.88 --> 00:14:08.52 mouth to get it done.
00:14:08.52 --> 00:14:14.48 Back to the book I had not previously met any platoon like this one they were quiet
00:14:14.48 --> 00:14:20.60 thoughtful and unabraceive soldiers there was little swearing and there existed a tranquility
00:14:20.60 --> 00:14:24.08 in their relationships with one another.
00:14:24.08 --> 00:14:28.72 Their eyes implored me not to fail them.
00:14:28.72 --> 00:14:35.28 Two factors were immediately apparent firstly the platoon required quiet firm and confident
00:14:35.28 --> 00:14:37.84 leadership.
00:14:37.84 --> 00:14:42.000 So that's a good assessment you know you can see these guys don't need anybody yelling
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.32 at him and here's the second point secondly if I failed to use my imagination and
00:14:48.32 --> 00:14:54.72 slavishly followed the battle school drills most of the platoon would not survive another
00:14:54.72 --> 00:14:56.72 major battle.
00:14:56.72 --> 00:15:01.44 So all the things he learned the standard typical stuff that he learned that wasn't
00:15:01.44 --> 00:15:06.64 an work and it hadn't worked that's why they had so many replacements come in.
00:15:06.64 --> 00:15:11.04 Back to the book in fact the problem that faced me with 18 platoon was identical to the
00:15:11.04 --> 00:15:16.80 one facing general Montgomery army group commander how to fight and defeat the cream of the
00:15:16.80 --> 00:15:24.48 SS Panzer divisions in the closed Normandy Bokaj and still retained sufficient infantry riflemen
00:15:24.48 --> 00:15:27.44 to live in fight tomorrow.
00:15:27.44 --> 00:15:33.52 The problem was a difficult one obviously I must set an example and always lead from the front
00:15:33.52 --> 00:15:40.64 however if I became over eager and got myself killed or wounded the whole object of my previous
00:15:40.64 --> 00:15:44.88 training and my responsibility to my platoon would be cast away.
00:15:44.88 --> 00:15:49.76 I would in fact be letting down a team platoon so he knows he's got to lead from the front
00:15:49.76 --> 00:15:52.16 same time he knows he's got to stay alive.
00:15:52.16 --> 00:15:58.16 He knows he got to stay alive and this Normandy fighting here he talks about Normandy being
00:15:58.16 --> 00:16:04.72 a defender's paradise meaning when you're on the defense and Normandy it's it's a paradise
00:16:04.72 --> 00:16:09.52 for the people on defense which was the Germans back to the book we fought from one head
00:16:09.52 --> 00:16:15.68 road to the next up torturous overgrown sunken lanes ideal country for the German defender
00:16:15.68 --> 00:16:22.80 but a palling for attacking infantry however no arm but infantry could take and hold the Normandy
00:16:22.80 --> 00:16:28.32 Bokaj Bokaj is like a trees shrubs mankled together.
00:16:31.04 --> 00:16:36.16 It was here that I served my apprenticeship and the platoon developed its character which despite
00:16:36.16 --> 00:16:40.96 constant depletion by casualties over the coming ten months it would retain until the end of the war.
00:16:42.40 --> 00:16:49.76 It was also here that in perceptibly I became possessive with a tain platoon it was mine
00:16:49.76 --> 00:16:56.32 to be guarded with an almost maternal jealousy that resented all criticism of my soldiers.
00:16:57.84 --> 00:17:00.24 That's building at this point.
00:17:00.24 --> 00:17:09.92 Hmm, most important it was in the Bokaj that I began to appreciate how vital is grip
00:17:11.76 --> 00:17:17.52 grip on oneself grip on one soldiers and grip on the situation.
00:17:20.24 --> 00:17:25.60 Unlike characters in novels and films most men react nervously to real battle conditions
00:17:25.60 --> 00:17:35.36 discipline and regimental pride are supports but in decisive moments of great danger the grip of the
00:17:35.36 --> 00:17:44.16 leader on the lead is paramount. Infantry section in platoon commanders must possess the minds and
00:17:44.16 --> 00:17:50.88 hearts of their soldiers. Strength of character is not enough successful leadership in battle
00:17:50.88 --> 00:17:55.92 although complex and intangible always seem to me to depend on two factors.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.36 Firstly soldiers must have confidence in their leaders professional ability and secondly they must
00:18:05.36 --> 00:18:12.32 trust them as men. So there you go they gotta have confidence in your ability and trust.
00:18:14.24 --> 00:18:19.20 And this trust topic comes up all the time and I use the the word relationships
00:18:19.20 --> 00:18:24.96 kind of interchangeably with trust. I always have to remind myself to point that out that when I'm
00:18:24.96 --> 00:18:29.20 talking about relationships and building relationships and business on the battlefield in life
00:18:30.08 --> 00:18:35.44 relationships are a trust that's what they are. We build your relationship on trust and I guess you could have
00:18:36.32 --> 00:18:40.32 you know relationships that aren't built on trust that there was like another thing you know
00:18:40.32 --> 00:18:44.56 I have a relationship with that guy but you know but that's not the one that's what I'm talking about
00:18:44.56 --> 00:18:48.88 about. I'm a good relationship. Yeah. Those are based on trust and those are obviously
00:18:50.16 --> 00:18:56.000 the the second most important thing to him. So first is confidence in their ability and second is trust.
00:18:58.32 --> 00:19:02.48 I like this part. It helps too if a leader has the reputation of being lucky.
00:19:04.16 --> 00:19:10.08 Field Marshal Montgomery placed great importance on the principle of making the enemy dance to your tune.
00:19:10.08 --> 00:19:17.68 No where is this more important than in Poutooning Company Battle? It is decisive because if you do not
00:19:17.68 --> 00:19:24.88 dominate events your enemy will. There you go. That's your jits. You're right there. Be
00:19:24.88 --> 00:19:30.72 first. Be first. Be first. Yeah. You gotta be first. You gotta dictate the pace. You gotta you gotta be proactive.
00:19:30.72 --> 00:19:40.72 Hmm. Back to the book Sound Leadership like True Love to which I suspect it is closely related
00:19:40.72 --> 00:19:49.04 is all powerful. It can overcome the seemingly impossible and it's effect on both leader and
00:19:49.04 --> 00:19:56.40 lead is profound and lasting. Even after the passage of 40 years, brief mention of the battalions
00:19:56.40 --> 00:20:02.48 finest officers and NCOs bring brings a smile to the faces of the survivors of my Poutoon.
00:20:03.84 --> 00:20:10.56 Their resentment of those who failed to lead when it mattered most still runs astonishingly deep.
00:20:12.24 --> 00:20:19.28 So leadership can overcome seemingly impossible. This is why leadership is the most important
00:20:19.28 --> 00:20:28.16 thing on the battlefield. Now he's going into his. So that's kind of his assessment and this is
00:20:28.16 --> 00:20:33.04 based on his experience which we're about to get into. Then he does more assessments. There's more
00:20:33.04 --> 00:20:37.36 more he talks more about what he learns about leadership as a whole. But you have to kind of
00:20:37.36 --> 00:20:43.44 understand what he went through and figure out where he learned it from. The first, his first command
00:20:43.44 --> 00:20:50.40 in battle here we go back to the book. We were to attack this rugged hill from the west with the
00:20:50.40 --> 00:20:56.40 fifth wheelchairs on our right and the fourth wheelchairs in reserves. The approach march to our
00:20:56.40 --> 00:21:01.76 forming up place had been a nightmare of swirling a brace of dust, shelling and the stench
00:21:01.76 --> 00:21:09.04 of exhaust fumes from the tanks which transported us forward. We were due to attack at 1500 hours
00:21:09.04 --> 00:21:16.08 with a company leading on the right and B company on the left. We followed B company. B company
00:21:16.08 --> 00:21:22.08 moved off quickly with our company deployed about 300 yards behind. Their forward platoon
00:21:22.08 --> 00:21:28.24 had barely crossed the stream when concentrated spend outfire came from the front and from both
00:21:28.24 --> 00:21:35.20 flanks. So spend outfire. This is kind of a generic term that the brits used for German machine guns.
00:21:35.20 --> 00:21:42.56 They're primarily talking about the MG 42 which is a big belt-fed machine gun. Very similar to
00:21:42.56 --> 00:21:48.64 a modern what we have M60 or Mark 48 machine gun. A big heavy belt-fed machine gun
00:21:49.92 --> 00:21:56.96 which lays down the insane amounts of suppressive fire. So here we go. They're getting hit from
00:21:56.96 --> 00:22:01.84 both flanks with these machine guns back to the book. There must have been about 12 machine guns
00:22:01.84 --> 00:22:09.36 firing at one time. This devastating display of firepower stopped the battalion dead in its tracks.
00:22:09.36 --> 00:22:16.80 There was no way forward or around it and no way to retire. Some of the guns had engaged D company
00:22:16.80 --> 00:22:23.52 over the heads of B company and private Morrison 18 platoon was killed. So there's his first guy,
00:22:23.52 --> 00:22:31.20 lost. I like this the way he starts off this next sentence here. First word,
00:22:31.20 --> 00:22:37.12 powerless. So he's in his first combat situation. He's got one man killed and how does he feel
00:22:37.12 --> 00:22:42.32 powerless. Here we go. Powerless and crouching in a headrow. I tried to identify the Spanned
00:22:42.32 --> 00:22:48.32 Alphazicians. This proved impossible as they still kept up their crushing display of firepower.
00:22:49.12 --> 00:22:53.44 In my ignorance I expected that the enemy machine gunners would soon expand their ammunition.
00:22:53.44 --> 00:23:03.68 They did not. Nor did they in dozens of subsequent battles. So he's waiting for them to stop shooting.
00:23:03.68 --> 00:23:10.56 They don't. They just keep coming. Captain Scamel commanding A company was severely wounded.
00:23:10.56 --> 00:23:15.68 Major Thomas commanding B company was killed. Their companies were badly cut up on our right
00:23:15.68 --> 00:23:21.12 the fifth wheelchairs had faired no better with their CO killed and casualties mounting.
00:23:21.12 --> 00:23:27.60 Their attack also foundered. As the afternoon turned to evening,
00:23:27.60 --> 00:23:32.000 shelling and mortoring increased much of it passing over our heads. Thus isolating us from the
00:23:32.64 --> 00:23:38.48 reserve battalion. So the Germans are mortoring over their heads so that the reserve battalion can't
00:23:38.48 --> 00:23:45.84 get to them. Shortly before dark, a troop of tanks arrived. One of which was able to cross the
00:23:45.84 --> 00:23:51.36 stream and give us some brave, close support. Undoubtedly it increased our morale but it was not enough
00:23:51.36 --> 00:23:58.88 to get the whole attack underway again. Any movement by B company to our front brought down instant
00:23:58.88 --> 00:24:06.32 and concentrated Spanned Alphazer. The same applied to us a few hundred yards to their rear.
00:24:07.04 --> 00:24:12.08 Fortunately the enemy did not seem to have any anti-tank guns so our armored friends
00:24:12.08 --> 00:24:19.12 were comparatively safe. But the fact remained that about 12 Spanned O's had halted a battalion
00:24:19.12 --> 00:24:26.88 attack without our locating even one of them. That's what suppressive fire does. That's what a
00:24:26.88 --> 00:24:32.40 big machine gun does. You got 12 big machine guns that's stopping 700 people from moving.
00:24:33.84 --> 00:24:38.000 That's called suppressive fire. That's why you don't when you heard Roger Hayden talk about
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.36 how many heavy weapons that how many machine guns they'd carry. They think they had nine
00:24:43.36 --> 00:24:52.32 out of opportunity to 14. That's why. As Dusk fell a new plan was made. C and D companies would
00:24:52.32 --> 00:24:57.52 advance and single file through A and B companies and using the cover of darkness infiltrate
00:24:57.52 --> 00:25:01.36 the enemy position. Once through them we would climb to the top of the hill and consolidate.
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:07.68 A cold and damp mist descended which with fading light gave us welcome cover but also
00:25:07.68 --> 00:25:12.72 wretched discomfort. We were still in shirt sleeves which became damp from the sweat of our
00:25:12.72 --> 00:25:19.68 exertion climbing the steep lower slopes. A lurk with pistol in hand I anticipated a sudden brush
00:25:19.68 --> 00:25:26.80 with an enemy post. Not a shot was fired. By some miracle we passed right through their positions
00:25:26.80 --> 00:25:36.000 without being detected or luck had changed. So you're going to see quite a bit of that is as they
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.88 were what the Germans were doing at this point defending hard but then instead of staying and dying
00:25:40.88 --> 00:25:45.68 in most cases they would retreat. And so they'd fight really hard for a while and then retreat.
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:49.28 They'd advance if they had an opportunity but you're going to see a lot of that.
00:25:50.32 --> 00:25:54.40 Back to the book we now had to advance across a large orchard. So I deployed the
00:25:54.40 --> 00:25:59.76 cartoon with two sections up and urged them forward as fast as possible. Suddenly in the middle of
00:25:59.76 --> 00:26:04.000 the orchard we came across a young girl in a clean white dress sitting with her back to an
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.84 apple tree sketching. Now I just talked about this the most of the random things that happen
00:26:11.84 --> 00:26:16.96 in combat and this is what I'm talking about and how do you train for that? How would you ever
00:26:16.96 --> 00:26:20.16 if you're running a battle problem to train people what are you going to do put a white girl
00:26:20.16 --> 00:26:24.32 in a white dress and then sitting with her back to a tree sketching? Doesn't make any sense?
00:26:24.32 --> 00:26:28.32 How do you deal with it? Back to the book she seemed quite oblivious to the mortar fire in 18
00:26:28.32 --> 00:26:33.20 boutunes warlike appearance. How to stop pretty young girls from interfering with battle
00:26:33.20 --> 00:26:38.40 had not been part of my training as an officer cadet nor had it appeared on the curriculum of
00:26:38.40 --> 00:26:44.80 any battle schools which without exception had dispared of my future as an infantry soldier.
00:26:46.24 --> 00:26:51.68 Fortunately there was a farmhouse beside the orchard and it had a seller where she was persuaded
00:26:51.68 --> 00:26:57.36 to shelter while we got on with our battle. I reported what it occurred to our company commander
00:26:57.36 --> 00:27:01.28 who told me that I was being quite ridiculous really Jerry you're being absurd.
00:27:01.28 --> 00:27:08.64 With that remark I realized that he had been a schoolmaster, a breed with whom I had been in conflict
00:27:10.08 --> 00:27:16.72 until quite recently. A breed with whom I'd been in conflict with until quite recently. So this guy
00:27:16.72 --> 00:27:23.84 has the attitude of a schoolmaster which in England is a little bit different and especially in the
00:27:23.84 --> 00:27:28.80 1930s and 40s you know the strict I think of a pink Floyd you know the headmaster
00:27:28.80 --> 00:27:33.68 how can you have it you putting if you don't eat you meet that guy that's what he's comparing them to.
00:27:34.56 --> 00:27:39.84 His next sarcastic remark I would be obliged Jerry if you would kindly get on with the war.
00:27:40.56 --> 00:27:43.76 He gave me little indication of what he wanted my opportunity to do,
00:27:43.76 --> 00:27:49.92 nor did it inspire confidence. We were still over 200 yards from the meadow surrounded by corn fields
00:27:49.92 --> 00:27:54.80 which was the company's objective and now became apparent that our company commander had an
00:27:54.80 --> 00:28:00.80 academic and detached attitude of mind which made it quite impossible for him to come in the company.
00:28:01.76 --> 00:28:06.08 So the company the company commander's not in the game. There's one thing to be detached from your
00:28:06.08 --> 00:28:10.80 emotions to make sure you're not getting caught up in the mayhem was another thing to be so detached
00:28:10.80 --> 00:28:16.48 that you're not even aware of what's going on and actually I had a name for this when I was running
00:28:16.48 --> 00:28:22.96 training. Battlefield aloofness is what I call them because we'd get these guys you get these
00:28:22.96 --> 00:28:27.52 guys and we'd be running these crazy battlefield problems on them and there'd be not to be crazy
00:28:27.52 --> 00:28:32.40 and you'd go remember one time there's the the task unit commander there's all this mayhem going on.
00:28:32.40 --> 00:28:36.000 The Patoons are getting overrun and people are getting me you know shot with paintball and they're
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.80 not hitting their objectives and I walk over to the company commander he's sitting in a home v
00:28:40.80 --> 00:28:44.32 I'm sorry the the to you commander the troop commander he's sitting in a home v
00:28:45.68 --> 00:28:49.76 and I like the windows up because they're both windows but he doesn't want to get shot with paintball
00:28:49.76 --> 00:28:54.48 the windows up he's just sitting in there he's got his head set on of his radio like knock on the door
00:28:54.48 --> 00:29:01.68 I'm like hey man you know what what's going on out there he's like well I'm I'm trying to gather that
00:29:01.68 --> 00:29:08.48 information right now and I'm like bro you eager to gather anything here but dust yeah you need to
00:29:08.48 --> 00:29:12.88 get out there and make something happen because his idea was you know I need to be detached
00:29:12.88 --> 00:29:17.12 which I talk about being detached all the time but there's a difference between being and as you
00:29:17.12 --> 00:29:22.16 see the same thing in businesses where the the the boss or the leader has no idea what's
00:29:22.16 --> 00:29:27.04 happening on the ground floor right he has no what the the workers are doing so he's so far to
00:29:27.04 --> 00:29:32.64 attach that he's he's you know let them eat cake right that's where that's where this guy is
00:29:32.64 --> 00:29:38.80 wait so why is that that's because what they they just in a way just depend on them to just handle it
00:29:38.80 --> 00:29:42.48 on their own they think they're gonna handle it on their own which is a good attitude to have until
00:29:42.48 --> 00:29:48.40 they can't handle it anymore right once they can't once a once a team or a platoon or a business
00:29:48.40 --> 00:29:54.08 you can't handle it on their own and they're failing you have to get you have to go do your
00:29:54.08 --> 00:29:58.48 job you have to step up you have to step down as leader you have to get in there and square that
00:29:58.48 --> 00:30:05.12 stuff away yeah so it's that without the get in their part right it's just like all right just
00:30:05.12 --> 00:30:10.32 call me when it's done yeah and and and the problem is somebody's got to sort these problems out
00:30:10.32 --> 00:30:15.60 yeah yeah they're there they're real and and they're not getting better and you might take you a
00:30:15.60 --> 00:30:19.04 minute's go okay wait a second this these problems aren't getting better what should I do
00:30:19.04 --> 00:30:22.24 once you realize that they're not getting better you got to get in there make it happen yeah
00:30:24.24 --> 00:30:29.60 this guy's not doing that back to the book he'd be behaved like a superseelious
00:30:29.60 --> 00:30:35.76 umpire on an exercise in England at any moment I expected him to had managed me for bad tactics
00:30:35.76 --> 00:30:43.12 and the schoolboy in me feared that I might be sent to the headmaster for beating so they continue on
00:30:43.12 --> 00:30:47.84 we seized the highest point which faced the enemy and the other platoons quickly deployed
00:30:47.84 --> 00:30:53.44 to give all around defense of the other flanks after being murdered the company required no
00:30:53.44 --> 00:31:01.92 encouragement to dig in the real motivator getting mortar will make you shovel hard yeah the company
00:31:01.92 --> 00:31:10.24 commander walked round the platoon positions I ain't everyone with distaste nothing pleased him
00:31:10.24 --> 00:31:15.52 and he suddenly announced that he must sleep which he did in my slit trench getting not a good
00:31:15.52 --> 00:31:21.92 feeling about this company commander just looking at everyone like negatively and then all of a
00:31:21.92 --> 00:31:27.92 sudden he wants to sleep I don't like this guy and of course he sleeps in in my trench
00:31:27.92 --> 00:31:34.64 mm now this is good there's another officer that's there that's present a guardian angel was
00:31:34.64 --> 00:31:41.52 watching over us in the guise of Dennis Clark Dennis some years older than me was exceptionally
00:31:41.52 --> 00:31:49.44 kind to me and tolerant of my immaturity pay attention this is good he took my took me by the arm a
00:31:49.44 --> 00:31:57.52 few paces away from my platoon who the hell is in command of this shambles sunny I muttered the
00:31:57.52 --> 00:32:03.68 unconvincing explanation that it was our company commander looking me straight in the eye he drew a
00:32:03.68 --> 00:32:09.60 deep breath which managed to express both exasperation at my explanation and sympathy with my
00:32:09.60 --> 00:32:19.44 predicament you and I know that he is not so what are you going to do about it I asked him if I
00:32:19.44 --> 00:32:28.32 should take command his expression hardened yes you bloody well should some demonstration of loyalty
00:32:28.32 --> 00:32:33.52 to my wretched company commander was obviously required I blurred it out that he was really a school master
00:32:33.52 --> 00:32:39.76 and not a professional soldier so he's kind of defending him Dennis put his arm around my shoulder
00:32:39.76 --> 00:32:51.36 and whispered in my ear so was eyes sunny so that's awesome the company commander is not leading
00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.08 and this this guy Dennis Clark quit think he's artillery gunner pulls this guy's head aside and
00:33:00.08 --> 00:33:05.60 just throw you better take charge of this and you better do it quick back to the book we were now
00:33:05.60 --> 00:33:11.92 well dug in on our objective the company commander was still asleep Dennis was arranging defensive
00:33:11.92 --> 00:33:19.84 fire tasks for me I had assumed command of D company without a word passing between our company
00:33:19.84 --> 00:33:26.000 commander and me in practice it made not the slightest difference because because like a bad
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:34.80 preparatory school master he saw his role as one of examination and criticism this he continued to
00:33:34.80 --> 00:33:40.88 do despite the incredulous stairs of the ncos so he's taken charge and and he hasn't even said anything
00:33:40.88 --> 00:33:45.76 he's just done it he just took charge and all the guys the guys continue to walk around did
00:33:45.76 --> 00:33:52.32 stare glare at everyone but that doesn't matter so this is a classic example your leader's not
00:33:52.32 --> 00:33:57.68 leading I've given this answer to so many times but this is a classic this might be one of the best
00:33:57.68 --> 00:34:05.12 examples your leaders not leading that's fine good step up and lead yourself hmm back to the book
00:34:05.12 --> 00:34:09.60 by dawn the enemy had retired an elements of the Italian move forward to consolidate and strength
00:34:09.60 --> 00:34:15.92 and decoupling his position the whole operation was very amateur there was no doubt that the new
00:34:15.92 --> 00:34:22.40 company commander could not command a company in battle nor could I who is just beginning to master
00:34:22.40 --> 00:34:28.24 the rudiments of commanding a platoon he was removed within a few hours I think Dennis had something to
00:34:28.24 --> 00:34:34.16 do with it but he was not the kind of man to confide in 20 year old sub-alterns so that's another
00:34:34.16 --> 00:34:41.60 classic thing right there is that this guy Dennis who is another officer probably went and said
00:34:41.60 --> 00:34:45.92 to get this guy out of here get this company commander out of here but when he does it the company
00:34:45.92 --> 00:34:51.28 commander gets removed and and he doesn't say anything to Sydney Jerry he doesn't you to
00:34:51.28 --> 00:34:56.72 rattle it out or brag about her make a big deal he doesn't say anything just happens it's like
00:34:56.72 --> 00:35:01.84 when I had a mutiny and my platoon and the commanding officer's like no we're not firing anyone you
00:35:01.84 --> 00:35:06.40 guys get out of here shut your mouth and go back to work no we're like okay and then a few days
00:35:06.40 --> 00:35:11.44 a little like a week later he got fired but he wasn't because of us as far as we knew right no one
00:35:11.44 --> 00:35:17.68 said anything we just knew he got fired yeah well what reason hmm we knew we had something to do with it
00:35:17.68 --> 00:35:25.68 but same thing so you don't need to create a distrust and disloyalty and and not even just those
00:35:25.68 --> 00:35:30.24 words but you don't need to create drama yeah right don't create the drama yeah that guy's
00:35:30.24 --> 00:35:34.40 going to go in somewhere he's getting building someone else hey you guys want everybody yeah yeah we're
00:35:34.40 --> 00:35:40.24 not doing that we're not doing that we're not building up our own ego by disparaging someone else's
00:35:40.24 --> 00:35:47.44 let's worry about the whole team that sounds like a good idea to me yeah back to the book I now have
00:35:47.44 --> 00:35:52.80 little doubt that for the first two months in Normandy we lack two things comprehensive and imaginative
00:35:52.80 --> 00:35:58.64 training and personal experience of battle we were also seriously handicapped by our casual
00:35:58.64 --> 00:36:05.12 attitude too many junior officers did not think for themselves and persistently relied on the
00:36:05.12 --> 00:36:11.76 narrow teaching of battle schools who's dogma had assumed the proportion of holy rit so whatever
00:36:11.76 --> 00:36:16.96 he was taught he was taught that that's the only way you can ever do it and these guys and if
00:36:16.96 --> 00:36:22.64 talk about this many times on the on the podcast the goal when I was running training was to actually
00:36:22.64 --> 00:36:27.36 get the people to think it wasn't get sure you have to establish the baseline standard operating
00:36:27.36 --> 00:36:33.68 procedures that's great and those need to be rock solid but once those things are established you
00:36:33.68 --> 00:36:39.76 need to make people understand that you don't always follow them and you need to call off a piece
00:36:39.76 --> 00:36:43.12 of that standard operating procedure to insert some other thing and bring in another standard
00:36:43.12 --> 00:36:46.56 operating procedure and mix and match them so you get something that's effective you need to
00:36:46.56 --> 00:36:51.92 think that's what a leader needs to do a leader needs to think back to the book the British
00:36:51.92 --> 00:36:56.64 infantry platoons and companies were overtrained and board stiff with basic infantry tactics
00:36:56.64 --> 00:37:00.80 which as far as they went were good much of this training unfortunately had been in the hands
00:37:00.80 --> 00:37:06.96 of battle school instructors who themselves lacked battle experience and imagination
00:37:08.40 --> 00:37:15.12 these tended to become pedagogues disciples of DS directing staff solution
00:37:15.12 --> 00:37:20.08 about which no argument could be tolerated so DS is that he be he mentions in a bunch
00:37:20.88 --> 00:37:24.64 like that's their solution the directing staff you can't argue with them they're the they're the
00:37:24.64 --> 00:37:33.04 cadre possibly like most of our entry infantry they suffered some consequences of the pre-roar
00:37:33.04 --> 00:37:39.68 shortage of creativity intelligent regimental officers two few of them were professionally
00:37:39.68 --> 00:37:44.56 dedicated to the extent that they could visualize how battles would be fought and identify the
00:37:44.56 --> 00:37:50.08 problems that might arise when planning them they seemed to lack the capacity to think relentlessly
00:37:50.08 --> 00:37:56.80 through these things until solutions were found much of their time had been spent policing the British
00:37:56.80 --> 00:38:03.76 empire also unlike the Germans we British instinctively avoid displays of keenness
00:38:04.72 --> 00:38:08.96 the enthusiast particularly if he is innovative isn't embarrassment
00:38:08.96 --> 00:38:18.32 thus the battlefield became our teacher and inevitably it exacted a grim price in blood and time
00:38:20.32 --> 00:38:28.40 so as you're training you got to push yourself hard you've got to put yourself in situations
00:38:28.40 --> 00:38:31.52 I don't care what you're training for I don't care if you're training for combat in a
00:38:31.52 --> 00:38:38.88 sea of platoon in an army infantry platoon or if you're in the business world and you're training your leaders to handle
00:38:38.88 --> 00:38:44.32 situations or you're training your customer service reps to handle situations what no matter which one of
00:38:44.32 --> 00:38:48.56 those you're in you need to push people hard you need to put them in worst case scenario so that they
00:38:48.56 --> 00:38:52.16 need to learn how they need to learn how to think to get out of those problems
00:38:52.16 --> 00:39:02.32 hmm I recall within bearishment an incident at 45th Infantry Division battle school during the
00:39:02.32 --> 00:39:08.48 spring of 1944 an exceptionally tall and good-natured Canadian officer had been sent to the school to
00:39:08.48 --> 00:39:14.16 give a talk on the street fighting he had experienced nearly it was an interesting talk but some of
00:39:14.16 --> 00:39:21.12 his advice ran contrary to that being taught in the school when the lecture was over the chief and
00:39:21.12 --> 00:39:28.96 instructor with insulting condensation thank this shy and kindly man for a vivid word picture
00:39:28.96 --> 00:39:36.24 and turning to the students warned us that as this officer's experience was probably unusual
00:39:36.24 --> 00:39:45.68 we had best not stray from the DS solution as taught at that school so you got to combat veteran
00:39:45.68 --> 00:39:52.72 come and back with experience from street fighting in Italy and he'd come back with some different tactics
00:39:53.84 --> 00:40:01.36 and they tell him you don't listen that guy that's just a rare case close mind will get you killed
00:40:04.88 --> 00:40:12.000 this is starting to talk about they're overall sort of formulation of combat plans and how they
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.40 operated back to the book the most successful actions by 18 Paltoon were fought without the support of
00:40:18.40 --> 00:40:26.72 artillery or armor we had learned in a hard school how to skirmish infiltrate and edge our way forward
00:40:27.44 --> 00:40:33.52 the right or left flanking platoon attack so beloved of the battle school staff would rarely succeed in
00:40:33.52 --> 00:40:41.04 the Normandy Bocage I remember with harbing locked into timetables of meticulously planned
00:40:41.04 --> 00:40:46.96 large battles these invariably left the junior infantry commander no scope for exploitation
00:40:47.60 --> 00:40:53.52 if you found a gap in the enemy defenses adherence to artillery program which rarely could be altered
00:40:53.52 --> 00:40:59.36 effectively stopped any personal initiative so what that saying is you have these the artillery
00:40:59.36 --> 00:41:04.56 that's gonna drop bombs they're gonna bomb or strike with artillery at certain regions in certain
00:41:04.56 --> 00:41:10.40 times so you might see the enemy running away and you have a chance to gain a superior tactical position
00:41:10.40 --> 00:41:14.24 but you can't because you know that that's where the bombs are going to be hitting in the next 12
00:41:14.24 --> 00:41:21.04 minutes so you can't go so now you sit and wait so he got locked in by that back to the book to me
00:41:21.04 --> 00:41:25.28 the preparations for these battles assumed the demented proportion of a cough got like
00:41:25.28 --> 00:41:33.20 nightmare ballet in which the anonymous they ordained that we must perform a choreographed ritual
00:41:33.20 --> 00:41:42.08 dance macabre I felt trapped and helpless no solo parts were written into the score nor was
00:41:42.08 --> 00:41:50.08 their scope for small groups of performers in this mammoth ballet of machines undoubtedly far shadows
00:41:50.08 --> 00:41:56.72 from the song that the battle song clouded my emotions but instinct told me that this kind of show
00:41:56.72 --> 00:42:02.72 would be unlikely to succeed the irony was that this support was planned and given to the infantry
00:42:02.72 --> 00:42:09.12 with the best of intentions the song had cast its shadows on our artillery and armored commanders
00:42:09.12 --> 00:42:17.44 both genuinely believed that their hands that in their hands they had the pancia which would protect
00:42:17.44 --> 00:42:25.04 us the infantry from the terrible slaughter of 1916 instead they put us in a straight jacket so
00:42:25.04 --> 00:42:33.12 very interesting viewpoint and and it's something that we need to pay attention to because you've got
00:42:33.12 --> 00:42:38.72 to be flexible you've got to be flexible and that's exactly what he's talking about and these they
00:42:38.72 --> 00:42:42.96 would make these plans that were so comprehensive and there was no you weren't allowed to deviate
00:42:42.96 --> 00:42:46.64 from the plants and you're not allowed to deviate from the plans and something starts going
00:42:46.64 --> 00:42:55.76 differently than what you expected you're trapped yeah to a phone back to the book far too much time
00:42:55.76 --> 00:43:02.16 had been spent fitting the infantry and armor junior leaders into the big picture and to little
00:43:02.16 --> 00:43:10.64 time spent training them and stimulating their imagination initiative an individual resourcefulness
00:43:10.64 --> 00:43:17.60 to probe draw conclusions infiltrate and exploit weakness in the enemy's dispositions so he's
00:43:17.60 --> 00:43:22.56 he's criticizing this lack of initiative lack of creativity and the training to get that initiative
00:43:22.56 --> 00:43:29.76 in creativity back to the book after the first of August 18 puttune never failed in any attack
00:43:31.04 --> 00:43:34.56 sometimes we took a little longer than planned but we always got there in the end
00:43:34.56 --> 00:43:43.04 in defense we never lost one yard of ground nor did the enemy ever penetrate arpotune position
00:43:43.04 --> 00:43:49.44 and we always dominated no man's land with our patrols whether persistent patrolling is always
00:43:49.44 --> 00:43:57.44 sound policy I will argue elsewhere so he's saying once he kind of figured it out they didn't
00:43:57.44 --> 00:44:01.36 lose anymore they didn't lose any attacks and they didn't give up any ground talks about the
00:44:01.36 --> 00:44:07.52 armor our armor was accused of being tiger shy meaning scared of the tiger tanks of the Germans
00:44:07.52 --> 00:44:15.04 and I don't wonder why the devastation caused by a single hit of an 88 millimeter armor piercing
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:23.12 shell needed to be seen to be believed and this is an overall statement for the infantry and
00:44:23.12 --> 00:44:28.72 armor the British second army the sheer ferocity of the fighting in Normandy came as a
00:44:28.72 --> 00:44:37.04 salature solitary shock for which they were in some ways unprepared so it was devastating for
00:44:37.04 --> 00:44:46.48 these guys now we start pushing out out of out of Normandy and pushing into the scene
00:44:48.64 --> 00:44:54.80 and here we go they're pushing in the next day 28 August D company occupied a harricort
00:44:54.80 --> 00:45:01.60 this is the only operation of war that I ever known to go precisely as planned our supporting
00:45:01.60 --> 00:45:06.16 field regimen softened up the objective with their 25 pounders the company advanced over
00:45:06.16 --> 00:45:13.12 open farmland in a macular formation and consolidated exactly on time the only thing lacking
00:45:13.68 --> 00:45:23.04 was an enemy total bag one day's German one dead German and one dead hair rabbit
00:45:23.04 --> 00:45:28.24 right so the only one that everyone well was when there was no enemy to fight against there was
00:45:28.24 --> 00:45:34.56 there was two Germans one of them was dead the other one was dazed and that was their their last battle
00:45:35.36 --> 00:45:36.24 in France
00:45:39.28 --> 00:45:42.32 back to the book experience and Normandy had removed
00:45:43.52 --> 00:45:48.000 anxieties regarding commanding and under strength put to and so he hasn't had enough man he's supposed
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.44 to have 36 he's had like 17 18 19 in the attack particularly at night up till two
00:45:53.44 --> 00:45:55.84 nip full strength is just too big to maneuver quickly
00:45:57.20 --> 00:46:03.36 three rifle sections of about 20 above about seven man each plus headquarters was ideal
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.12 in defense it was a different matter the more riflemen on the ground the better
00:46:08.32 --> 00:46:15.20 our short stay in the men's ale millon gave me time to think
00:46:15.20 --> 00:46:21.92 the first opportunity to do so since i took command of 18 puttune it also gave me time to
00:46:21.92 --> 00:46:27.76 meet and talk with other young officers in the battalion it was then that I realized that 18
00:46:27.76 --> 00:46:36.40 puttune was no ordinary puttune it had some undefineable magic no quarrels little swearing
00:46:36.40 --> 00:46:40.80 despite the war that was the despite the war there was something peaceful about it
00:46:40.80 --> 00:46:48.72 a helping hand was always available for anybody the emotional links were firm and true
00:46:50.72 --> 00:46:56.08 I was a happy man so he realizes once he starts talking the other puttune commanders
00:46:56.08 --> 00:47:01.68 he's got this really special puttune that gets along great and he's he realizes it
00:47:03.12 --> 00:47:06.80 back to the book no young officer can command a puttune in battle on his own
00:47:06.80 --> 00:47:14.16 in Normandy I'd seen puttune commander served by poor nco struggling to gain some semblance of
00:47:14.16 --> 00:47:22.64 control over their but wielded and frightened men I'd also seen puttunes with good nco's go to pieces
00:47:22.64 --> 00:47:31.60 in the hands of an indifference officer Jim Kingston Doug Proctor and Owen cheeseman set the standard
00:47:31.60 --> 00:47:39.36 n-tone for 18 puttune without them I as the puttune commander would have joined the ranks of so many
00:47:39.36 --> 00:47:56.000 poor young officers who never achieved grip now going to another we're putting together another plan
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.24 as they're advancing and obviously this is a long book I'm doing an abridge version hitting
00:48:02.24 --> 00:48:09.44 some highlights you should get the book obviously get the book by the book back to the book
00:48:09.92 --> 00:48:15.44 at zero four hundred hours on twenty-fourth of September Douglass this is the new company commander
00:48:15.44 --> 00:48:22.64 Douglass held along oh group by candlelight in the seller of the farmhouse at which much to
00:48:22.64 --> 00:48:28.88 his annoyance I kept falling asleep we were ordered to advance straight eastward down a narrow
00:48:28.88 --> 00:48:36.32 country lane from the orchard to the main road and consolidate after the oh group and oh group is
00:48:36.32 --> 00:48:41.28 what they call the when their officers get together and pass the word knick called oh group after the
00:48:41.28 --> 00:48:46.000 oh group I made myself unpopular by asking why we're advancing towards an area of considerable
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:53.76 German opposition when my patrol found a better route by which we might outflank the enemy so
00:48:53.76 --> 00:48:58.40 that so he's saying hey wait what because his patrol his puttune had been out on a patrol and found
00:48:58.40 --> 00:49:05.44 a better route and he's asking why and he kind of gets shut down I was just twenty years old at the
00:49:05.44 --> 00:49:12.88 time and even then I knew I was incapable of disputing orders without giving a fence we started at
00:49:12.88 --> 00:49:17.76 zero six hundred hours two platoons leading on either side of the track the third falling in
00:49:17.76 --> 00:49:22.96 single filed down the track itself on either side were the small holdings were small holdings
00:49:22.96 --> 00:49:30.16 a few allotments in bungalows surrounded by small picket fences but platoons advanced through the
00:49:30.16 --> 00:49:35.52 gardens and vegetable patches and passed on either side of the bungalows the rear section
00:49:35.52 --> 00:49:40.72 searching each one quickly and while they're searching these little bungalows as their
00:49:40.72 --> 00:49:46.48 own patrol they find this back to the book during one of these hurried searches one section found
00:49:46.48 --> 00:49:54.56 a Dutch family the widdages father mother son and daughter riddled by schmites or fire
00:49:55.20 --> 00:50:01.76 that's a German machine gun they lay in awkward postures of death amid their ransacked home
00:50:01.76 --> 00:50:11.12 a visit from the SS no tears came nor did they come a half an hour later when we came upon
00:50:11.12 --> 00:50:17.44 the charred wreckage of an american decoda it had carried US parachute troops the 82nd airborne
00:50:17.44 --> 00:50:23.60 division and their torn and burnt bodies littered the orchard like charred and mutilated rag dolls
00:50:23.60 --> 00:50:32.000 it was a further iron or irony attached to the front window in what remained of the decoda's
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:40.64 cockpit was a tiny teddy bear untouched by flames two months before a lonely teddy bear and an
00:50:40.64 --> 00:50:48.32 impersonal pool of blood had brought forth tears now I was collected and objective when faced
00:50:48.32 --> 00:50:55.44 within the span of thirty minutes within a trotious murder and mass carnage by fire and he's
00:50:55.44 --> 00:51:02.48 referring there in the beginning of the book one of his first experiences he's by a slit trench
00:51:02.48 --> 00:51:10.24 and there's a dead guy soldier in it and there's a little teddy bear and and for some reason
00:51:10.24 --> 00:51:15.04 you know he's young he's in experience and it gets gets makes him super emotionally starts crying
00:51:15.04 --> 00:51:21.68 and and now he's a little further in the war he sees you know this horrible murdered family and these
00:51:23.04 --> 00:51:30.64 tragically you know burned and killed paratroopers and he's able to detach emotionally from it
00:51:34.16 --> 00:51:39.92 back to the book the enemy decided to make life unpleasant for us as possible by sudden unpredictable
00:51:39.92 --> 00:51:46.56 concentrations of heavy artillery right in the middle of our company area we called them stunks
00:51:46.56 --> 00:51:51.44 so he's gonna use that word it just means we're getting bombed one of these shells unfortunately
00:51:51.44 --> 00:51:59.60 fell right into one of sixteen platoon slit trenches no trace remained of the two men that were
00:51:59.60 --> 00:52:07.28 manning in it manning a brain in my platoon landscorpo jack Lee and private Peter Filmer
00:52:07.28 --> 00:52:13.28 were buried in the trench they shared other members of their section quickly dug them out unharmed
00:52:13.28 --> 00:52:21.84 very dirty and remarkably cheerful the self-propelled guns increased their activities
00:52:21.84 --> 00:52:28.08 filling the sky above the company with ugly black air bursts they could place these with
00:52:28.08 --> 00:52:33.84 uncanny accuracy to burst about twenty five feet above the road junction outside company headquarters
00:52:33.84 --> 00:52:42.24 the casualties mounted company sergeant major Sammy Jones and spot Martin the Jeepburg driver
00:52:42.24 --> 00:52:49.76 were both hit outside company HQ it was Sammy Jones who committed the battalion's only atrocity
00:52:51.28 --> 00:52:57.92 late one summer evening as the shadows from high trees and hedges fell across a small field
00:52:57.92 --> 00:53:05.04 the Normandy we took some young waffles and saw waffles and SS soldiers prisoner one of them a short
00:53:05.04 --> 00:53:13.12 stocky and fair youth of about eighteen proved insultingly truck-yland season the young
00:53:13.12 --> 00:53:19.12 loud by the scruff of his neck Sammy roared you can take that glint out of your eyes my boy
00:53:19.12 --> 00:53:28.40 and putting the wretched youth across his knees he gave his backside a sound whacking that is
00:53:28.40 --> 00:53:36.000 legit and that's again you know Sydney Jerry and he talks about how proud he is that his men
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:46.40 his men's behavior is so upstanding throughout this whole miserable experience and even when they
00:53:46.40 --> 00:53:54.16 see atrocities committed like by the SS they still maintain their discipline and their character
00:53:54.16 --> 00:54:00.96 and this is this is what he does oh you you're a little punk kid I'm gonna spank you
00:54:02.80 --> 00:54:11.92 you know tough the SS soldier getting put over the knee and spanked so after the attack so now
00:54:11.92 --> 00:54:18.88 this is again this is happening after one of these attacks and the whole the whole basic premise of
00:54:18.88 --> 00:54:26.40 this book is attack rest attack rest attack rest so as I'm reading I'm kind of picking out some of
00:54:26.40 --> 00:54:29.92 the attacks that they're going on and they're just moving through France and then through Germany that's
00:54:29.92 --> 00:54:34.24 what it is I should've explained that earlier but this is after one of the attacks
00:54:35.60 --> 00:54:40.40 it's interesting he says this smiling faces vanished and the gray look returned once more
00:54:40.40 --> 00:54:46.72 men walked with one air cocked in the air for approaching shells and with a slight stoop
00:54:47.76 --> 00:54:52.48 if you remember when I was talking about JP I was talking about how like you'd see guys they have
00:54:52.48 --> 00:54:59.60 this magical little stoop yeah that's what he's talking about and JP didn't have that no stoop
00:55:00.56 --> 00:55:05.84 JP who stand up like you stoop left he was not yeah he was stoopless he was standing up ready to get
00:55:05.84 --> 00:55:13.68 some but these guys as and it's contrast because when they're on the attack they go into like JP mode
00:55:13.68 --> 00:55:17.28 they're standing up straight they're ready to get some but then once they're on the defense and
00:55:17.28 --> 00:55:22.88 they're just waiting to get shell they start to stoop they start to crouch a little bit he continues
00:55:22.88 --> 00:55:27.20 back to the book the jokes began to peed around and the cheerful good morning surf ceased
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.40 when I went around the platoons at stand two morale was always higher during an attack
00:55:34.40 --> 00:55:42.96 sitting around and being sheldt is not an occupation to be recommended so there's a good lesson there
00:55:43.68 --> 00:55:49.12 if you or your team is being defensive about things your morale is going to go down because you're
00:55:49.12 --> 00:55:55.92 waiting to get hit so go on hit somebody you know go on the attack don't wait around don't let your
00:55:55.92 --> 00:56:08.72 morale drown here's another attack back to the book scrambling out of the culvert we set a fast
00:56:08.72 --> 00:56:15.12 pace up the side of the road to a company's positions this immediately brought small arms fire down
00:56:15.12 --> 00:56:21.44 on us but by then we were then 200 yards of their slit trenches so on we ran as fast as we could
00:56:21.44 --> 00:56:28.80 being soaked I began to steam my boots squelched and seemed to drag me back clawing at my feet as
00:56:28.80 --> 00:56:32.88 in a bad dream and stopping me from reaching the inviting cover of the slit trenches
00:56:33.76 --> 00:56:38.24 a company was dug in with two platoons forward in an orchard face to face to the enemy
00:56:38.24 --> 00:56:44.08 who were in dikes only a few yards beyond the third platoon was to the right rear protecting the
00:56:44.08 --> 00:56:52.72 open flank and company headquarters to the left rear centered on some farm buildings it was to these
00:56:52.72 --> 00:57:00.80 farm buildings that we ran hurling ourselves onto the straw on the barn floor we lay panting
00:57:00.80 --> 00:57:07.84 and gasping for breath john a cock a company commander appeared round the door of the barn
00:57:07.84 --> 00:57:16.24 he looked haggard and warned I doubt he had slept for a week the whole company area was covered
00:57:16.24 --> 00:57:22.24 by the most intense spandell fire and defensive and the defensive battle here was one of fire
00:57:22.24 --> 00:57:29.84 supremacy which the Germans had undoubtedly won a company's morale was low they had just lost
00:57:29.84 --> 00:57:36.000 hairy barns one of the platoon commanders who refusing to take cover strutted about an usual manner
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.88 he took a complete burst of spandell fire under the arm
00:57:40.88 --> 00:57:46.40 hairy was an amazing and fearless fellow who didn't care a damn for anything
00:57:47.44 --> 00:57:51.20 even after the burst hit him he still lived for about three hours
00:57:53.52 --> 00:57:59.92 the men respected hairy and with their idle shot down in front of them they were very jumpy
00:57:59.92 --> 00:58:08.48 another time you have to watch out for morale obviously
00:58:11.12 --> 00:58:17.36 now if you remember this book started in the summer time and now we're starting to get
00:58:19.20 --> 00:58:24.16 towards fall and this this is something I never thought about before
00:58:24.16 --> 00:58:30.80 when fall comes you know the sun is up for a shorter period of time
00:58:30.80 --> 00:58:35.28 so here we go back to the book the nights became longer and the dawns gray and chilly
00:58:35.84 --> 00:58:40.64 the sun sets were red and vivid and the days though beautiful short and rapidly
00:58:41.36 --> 00:58:46.88 as the nights lengthened the hours of staggered lengthened and with them the mental and physical
00:58:46.88 --> 00:58:54.96 fatigue of the company so they have to stay up you know rotate through watches at night
00:58:54.96 --> 00:58:59.12 you just don't get to sleep the whole time so if it's if it's dark for longer you got to stay
00:58:59.12 --> 00:59:04.88 wake longer at night so it's starting to wear on the company itself
00:59:06.48 --> 00:59:11.92 back to the book there was there is one incident small room when remembered by itself
00:59:11.92 --> 00:59:19.92 in a life of such incidents but very but to me very vivid in my platoon there was a young lad aged
00:59:19.92 --> 00:59:30.56 18 named Biddle he was of slight of build fair and looked a mere child he had a pleasant personality
00:59:30.56 --> 00:59:37.92 and was liked by everyone he had joined the company at La Mensell Millan after we had cross the
00:59:37.92 --> 00:59:47.28 CN at Vernon in August one morning there was a crack in a short interval of silence
00:59:49.52 --> 00:59:54.24 soon the shout went out stretcher bearers echoed through the orchard
00:59:55.84 --> 01:00:00.56 I ran towards the commotion and saw Biddle writhing in agony on the ground
01:00:00.56 --> 01:00:09.60 at first he looked on hurt but as I tore open his tunic I saw clear wound through his abdomen
01:00:09.60 --> 01:00:18.08 coming out by a spine he soon became numb and was no longer in pain but was very frightened and
01:00:18.08 --> 01:00:26.000 shivered we dragged him back behind the house and applied field dressings to his stomach and his
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.96 back in case the wound started to bleed his young life solely ebbbing from his body our stretcher bearers
01:00:35.76 --> 01:00:44.80 quietly and reverently carried him away the scene is now too poignant to remember without shedding
01:00:44.80 --> 01:00:51.60 a tear after Biddle had been evacuated the morale of the platoon dropped
01:00:51.60 --> 01:00:58.88 he had been hit while standing in his slit trench by a sniper at least 300 yards away
01:01:04.48 --> 01:01:11.36 and you know it's it's interesting and I didn't go into this part but there's a part earlier in the book where
01:01:13.04 --> 01:01:15.44 he he basically
01:01:15.44 --> 01:01:28.08 disparages some what the use of snipers and he talks about how they usually don't gain you anything
01:01:29.52 --> 01:01:34.88 tactically but it's interesting what it does to the morale of a platoon isn't it
01:01:37.60 --> 01:01:41.36 and he you know he doesn't completely know he he explains that there's uses and there's
01:01:41.36 --> 01:01:48.96 believe me there's probably no bigger believer in the use of snipers in the world than me but
01:01:48.96 --> 01:01:55.76 it's interesting yeah he he basically you can tell he's a very a guy with you know this extremely high
01:01:55.76 --> 01:02:02.48 moral character and he kind of gets the feeling when he explains it that you know he didn't feel
01:02:02.48 --> 01:02:07.76 comfortable with sniping because people aren't expecting it there's not a battle happening he felt like
01:02:07.76 --> 01:02:14.80 it was a cheap shot but it's interesting the effect that it actually has on his platoon
01:02:18.40 --> 01:02:25.36 in this moment here we're gonna get to a point he's got Germans are in a diek they're just a
01:02:25.36 --> 01:02:31.76 head of 18 18 platoon and 18 platoon is kind of pinned down and remember this character from
01:02:31.76 --> 01:02:36.48 earlier Dennis Clark Dennis Clark was the was the guy that pulled him aside and said hey you need to take
01:02:36.48 --> 01:02:41.04 man to his company well like I said Dennis Clark or I I thought I'd remember and I was right Dennis Clark
01:02:41.04 --> 01:02:48.08 was a was an artillery guy that called an artillery so here we go back to the book I was saved by
01:02:48.08 --> 01:02:57.04 Captain Dennis Clark MC our team gunner Dennis had a virtue also touch where 25 founders were concerned
01:02:58.64 --> 01:03:03.68 sniping with one gun that should get the buggers out he said with total confidence
01:03:03.68 --> 01:03:11.12 moving his 19 set into my that's a radio moving his 19 set into my platoon position no easy task in
01:03:11.12 --> 01:03:16.64 daylight he gave us a display of the most brilliant professionalism we had come to expect from the
01:03:16.64 --> 01:03:24.40 94th field regiment by firing with only one gun and making his mean point of impact beyond the diek
01:03:24.40 --> 01:03:32.000 containing the Germans he slowly decreased the range yard by yard until one shell exploded in the diek
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:41.92 out came five very wet and shaken pans or grandadiers during this episode all the platoon had to remain
01:03:43.12 --> 01:03:48.40 in the bottom of their slith trenches because Dennis' shells came over our positions with minimum
01:03:48.40 --> 01:03:54.16 clearance I doubt if any experienced infantry officer would deny that the Royal Artillery
01:03:54.16 --> 01:03:59.52 during the second World War were the most professionally competent people in the British Army
01:03:59.52 --> 01:04:07.68 so again an interesting dichotomy because in the beginning he talks about how the artillery
01:04:07.68 --> 01:04:13.28 can track them because it's being used in this broad plan that's locking in with there's no deviation
01:04:13.28 --> 01:04:18.88 but here he's talking about how brilliant it is because he's directly coordinating with it he's
01:04:18.88 --> 01:04:24.16 explaining to the artillery officer where to put those rounds what the problem is and then letting
01:04:24.16 --> 01:04:29.84 the artillery officer solve it so there's a dichotomy there just like there's a dichotomy with the snipers
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.56 back to the book after a few more days in the orchard we were becoming increasingly exhausted and
01:04:38.56 --> 01:04:44.08 our fighting efficiency deteriorated this condition existed not only in my company but throughout
01:04:44.08 --> 01:04:50.72 the battalion consequently the news of a move back to rest came as a colossal relief to us all
01:04:50.72 --> 01:04:56.80 but we did not know who is going to take over our positions the take over was to be at night
01:04:57.76 --> 01:05:02.48 and was to be carried out as quickly as possible if the enemy discovered it a determined attack could
01:05:02.48 --> 01:05:08.64 cause endless confusion and slaughter during the late afternoon of one particularly unpleasant day
01:05:08.64 --> 01:05:12.64 Douglas appeared that's a company commander appeared within American captain in two
01:05:12.64 --> 01:05:18.48 lieutenant's from a parachute battalion of the hundred and first airborne division they patied
01:05:18.48 --> 01:05:24.40 around the company area in their rubber-sold boots with the eyes of the whole company following them
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:29.68 it's a hundred and first is coming into a leave him having reckoned ordered our area the
01:05:29.68 --> 01:05:34.000 Americans returned to the company HQ to discuss administrative points for the takeover
01:05:34.72 --> 01:05:38.48 the plan was for the American company commander to bring his company down the main road in
01:05:38.48 --> 01:05:43.44 single file along the edge of the ditch when the head of the column reach our company HQ they would
01:05:43.44 --> 01:05:47.84 be met by guides from each of our platoons to lead the American platoons to their positions
01:05:47.84 --> 01:05:51.76 as soon as they were on the ground our platoons were withdraw and assemble on the road
01:05:52.80 --> 01:06:00.48 this may sound simple in practice at but at night in close contact with the enemy it certainly was not
01:06:01.20 --> 01:06:05.60 this type of operation leaves two companies particularly vulnerable during the handover
01:06:06.16 --> 01:06:09.84 a determined enemy could attack and turn the operation into a massacre
01:06:10.56 --> 01:06:15.52 this is one of and I've said this before on the podcast one of the hardest things to do is
01:06:15.52 --> 01:06:21.36 link up with friendly forces on the battlefield and if you're under fire it's it's even harder
01:06:22.16 --> 01:06:26.16 so this one they're trying to do it not under fire trying to sneak and make it happen
01:06:28.32 --> 01:06:32.08 back to the book the rest of the day was spent packing making sure the enemy noticed nothing of
01:06:32.08 --> 01:06:38.08 this antit activity we put our spare ammunition onto the carriers with great coats and blankets
01:06:38.08 --> 01:06:43.04 the whole afternoon was strangely quiet there was no activity from the enemy and we in turn kept quiet
01:06:43.04 --> 01:06:49.28 the sun went down a mid-a-firey sky looking east the sky was threateningly gray
01:06:50.80 --> 01:06:56.40 I went around I went around my position to with Sergeant Kingston before the Americans arrived
01:06:57.36 --> 01:07:02.08 all my men looked tired and could hardly muster a smile as I went from slit to slit
01:07:03.20 --> 01:07:07.20 many had contained two men and now contained only one
01:07:07.20 --> 01:07:15.12 together with some momento of his former mate a mess tin or a bloodstained jacket even a
01:07:15.12 --> 01:07:25.12 packet of cigarettes wet and limp with dew I wondered how many more momentos would be there
01:07:25.12 --> 01:07:33.36 when the Americans were relieved about an hour later the Americans arrived they loomed up in the
01:07:33.36 --> 01:07:37.84 darkness by the roadside padding along in the rubber sold boots without a whisper
01:07:39.04 --> 01:07:43.84 I fought at the time what splendid troops they were and how excellent their equipment
01:07:45.04 --> 01:07:50.08 I was particularly impressed by the silent and quick way they were led by their squad commanders
01:07:50.72 --> 01:07:54.000 to our section positions so
01:07:55.52 --> 01:07:59.68 there come the Americans who leave them the hundred first airborne division
01:07:59.68 --> 01:08:05.60 who's just outstanding soldiers they're just awesome and we worked with them
01:08:05.60 --> 01:08:11.04 I mean one of my platoon in Ramadi work with the live with them the first the 506
01:08:11.68 --> 01:08:18.48 the band of brothers and you can tell they're the reputation that the guys in Ramadi
01:08:18.48 --> 01:08:25.76 upheld that standard in every possible way but it's rooted all the way back to the soldiers right here
01:08:25.76 --> 01:08:31.76 sounds like this is what struck me when I read that I was like this this that that tradition of
01:08:31.76 --> 01:08:38.80 excellence in that unit has gone from world war to from these guys right here and it's that same
01:08:38.80 --> 01:08:41.60 attitude that I saw with guys in Ramadi the same attitude
01:08:45.84 --> 01:08:53.68 alright now he makes a statement here about this whole big operation which was called market garden
01:08:53.68 --> 01:08:59.52 which was this giant operation to try and caught off the Germans sees multiple bridges and
01:08:59.52 --> 01:09:06.000 there's three bridges they were trying to seize and it it didn't reach its full effect it wasn't
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.12 like a complete mission success they didn't achieve every objective that they wanted to
01:09:12.96 --> 01:09:18.08 so here we go back to the book market garden was a sad operation complete success coming so close
01:09:18.08 --> 01:09:27.44 at a stroke the war in Europe could have been finished in 1944 undoubtedly mistakes were made
01:09:27.44 --> 01:09:33.28 both by the first airborne division particularly their planners and also by 30 core and there was
01:09:33.28 --> 01:09:40.48 no shortage of bad luck however in my experiences in my experience most battles are riddled with
01:09:40.48 --> 01:09:47.84 misfortunes and mistakes and the of the sort found in this operation it was not a failure because
01:09:47.84 --> 01:09:54.48 the ground was taken and a prerequisite to both operation veritable and the rind crossing so wasn't
01:09:54.48 --> 01:10:00.88 like a total failure back to the book I'm convinced that had the supreme commander generalize
01:10:00.88 --> 01:10:07.52 now are given market garden the unqualified support that it justified it would have totally succeeded
01:10:07.52 --> 01:10:13.76 despite its crop of tack coerres and planning and execution I suppose it was just one more
01:10:13.76 --> 01:10:21.28 casualty of the american mania for dispersal of effort however it was without a doubt the most
01:10:21.28 --> 01:10:26.56 exciting and imaginatively planned battle in which 18 puttune ever fought and I'm proud we've
01:10:26.56 --> 01:10:31.68 taken part so he's talking about the folks of effort he's talking about you if you spread yourself
01:10:31.68 --> 01:10:35.28 out to thin you're not gonna you're not gonna make it happen we call that prioritize next hit
01:10:35.28 --> 01:10:42.64 what's the biggest priority let's put our resources there they didn't do that and therefore didn't
01:10:42.64 --> 01:10:48.64 get a full mission success now of course what resources were there what was available there's
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:55.44 no one has unlimited resources no one if you have that you have no issues right you just crush
01:10:55.44 --> 01:11:05.28 problems with manpower all right so now they're moving beyond market garden and planning
01:11:05.28 --> 01:11:12.96 actually planning he's planning a patrol through a village back to the bup battle school teaching
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:18.80 at the time prescribed a strength of 12 to 20 for a fighting patrol here again my instincts
01:11:18.80 --> 01:11:26.16 and experience did not conform to their teaching he's a rebel how can you command and control
01:11:26.16 --> 01:11:31.84 that number of men in the dark particularly in a skirmish Douglas the company commander
01:11:31.84 --> 01:11:40.08 tolerant of the absent absonancy of my opinions on these matters left the planning to me
01:11:40.80 --> 01:11:45.76 so cool Douglas is little decentralized command you figure out your plan then I like this the
01:11:45.76 --> 01:11:52.32 composition of the patrol I based on personalities and not on a battle school or day number so
01:11:52.32 --> 01:11:56.40 imagine that you're you're planning based on the personalities of the individuals you have
01:11:56.40 --> 01:12:02.32 the countryside being comparatively open I decided to take a bread gun being steady
01:12:02.32 --> 01:12:08.08 Williams and Filmer would fill the bill admirably if we ran into trouble they could provide
01:12:08.08 --> 01:12:12.24 covering fire for any assault we might make or if things went badly they could cover our
01:12:12.24 --> 01:12:19.20 withdrawal cover move obviously the assault party required strengthening so I decided to take a
01:12:19.20 --> 01:12:25.44 total patrol strength of six men one brand with seven magazines and three armed with stands
01:12:25.44 --> 01:12:31.60 with five magazines and four thirty six grenades each plus a pair of wire cutters I carried my
01:12:31.60 --> 01:12:37.76 cult four grenades and a non-brella my umbrella had been a source of amusement to the
01:12:37.76 --> 01:12:44.40 battoons inside found on the roadside in muc apart from keeping me dry in or out of a slit trench
01:12:44.40 --> 01:12:50.96 it was useful when prodding for mines and brought some fun and color to our lives Jim Kingston and Doug
01:12:50.96 --> 01:12:58.08 Proctor fought otherwise maintaining a disapproving silence which I failed to notice so now they're
01:12:58.08 --> 01:13:01.68 out on patrol moving down the bank the right we crawled forward in the mud and wet grass into
01:13:01.68 --> 01:13:08.16 we're almost past the orchard from which came the sound of digging and voices suddenly a challenge
01:13:08.16 --> 01:13:14.000 came from our front followed by a shower of stick grenades thrown from a trench just inside the
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.56 orchard on our left one of the grenades landed between my legs which were stretched out
01:13:20.56 --> 01:13:26.64 and spread apart as I lay flat on the river bank there was no flash it's explosions seemed
01:13:26.64 --> 01:13:35.04 muffled and more importantly owing to the soft mud I received not a scratch the game was up now
01:13:35.04 --> 01:13:39.92 the concentrated fire of the three stands poured into the German into the surprise Germans putting
01:13:39.92 --> 01:13:46.08 away my pistol I threw three thirty six grenades in quick succession into the orchard heardly
01:13:46.08 --> 01:13:54.80 reaching from my umbrella which alluded me and then enormously, economically we'd be to retreat so
01:13:57.60 --> 01:14:01.76 he gets a graze throw on him and actually had this happen until you bruiser some guys were out on a
01:14:01.76 --> 01:14:07.84 patrol they were an open field they had cover from one side because they had pre-plant how they were
01:14:07.84 --> 01:14:11.68 in a crosses field and while they were out there they got hit with machine gun fire and then mortars
01:14:11.68 --> 01:14:21.84 and they got mortars dating like on them and luckily because it was they were in like a muddy
01:14:21.84 --> 01:14:29.36 field like almost rice paddy scenario the mortars when they hit they went into the mud and so they
01:14:29.36 --> 01:14:34.72 exploded but there was no all the these trappinals all absorbed by the mud that's lucky day for
01:14:34.72 --> 01:14:42.16 the u-briser right there boys were a little more fired up when they came back from that one now they
01:14:42.16 --> 01:14:48.48 get back into a defensive perimeter I remember nights in defensive positions like grows beak stretched
01:14:48.48 --> 01:14:53.60 out in a slit trunch trying to get an hour sleep before going round the platoon positions to check
01:14:53.60 --> 01:15:00.16 that everything and everyone was all right one felt and was dirty and in the small hours of the
01:15:00.16 --> 01:15:06.32 morning with bootlaces cutting into swollen feet of foul tasting mouth and an aching snowmick
01:15:06.32 --> 01:15:12.24 life had little to commend it the dirt and discomfort worried me more than the danger
01:15:12.96 --> 01:15:19.76 danger for some reason that I've never understood exilorates but despite every effort to keep clean
01:15:19.76 --> 01:15:28.16 it did not always prove possible and that was unbearable never once since I never once since
01:15:28.16 --> 01:15:34.08 have I not been grateful to sink into a hop bath or slide into a bed with clean sheets
01:15:35.28 --> 01:15:41.60 we went to extraordinary lengths to keep the dirt at bay once in Normandy I washed and shaved
01:15:41.60 --> 01:15:49.76 in the rainwater in the deep ruts made by carts after words I discovered that 400 yards away
01:15:49.76 --> 01:15:57.92 the opposition had been overlooking my ablutions a decent lot who obviously approved
01:15:57.92 --> 01:16:04.32 of my personal hygiene so they didn't kill him hey this guy's just trying to be clean let's
01:16:04.32 --> 01:16:10.32 let him continue back to the book during the campaign 18 platoon carried out three types of
01:16:10.32 --> 01:16:17.04 patrols reconnaissance standing and fighting the first two invariably useful because they provided
01:16:17.04 --> 01:16:22.88 information if only negative fighting patrols of which I led many were a different and
01:16:22.88 --> 01:16:28.72 contentious proposition unlike the German and American armies we had vigorous policy regarding
01:16:28.72 --> 01:16:34.000 fighting patrols particularly at night and when things were static on both sides on the defense
01:16:35.60 --> 01:16:41.12 the thinking behind this policy seemed to me at times to be superficial and probably left over
01:16:41.12 --> 01:16:47.52 from the great war world war one if when detailed for a fighting patrol young officers
01:16:47.52 --> 01:16:53.68 queried the wisdom of its given object there was always the standard reply I quite agree with you
01:16:53.68 --> 01:17:00.48 but it all helps to dominate no man's land there is undoubtedly a certain validity of this argument
01:17:01.20 --> 01:17:07.36 but was it worth the consequent loss of good young officers and nco's I doubt it
01:17:07.36 --> 01:17:16.72 shortly after the war I was able to briefly voice my reservations to my illustrious army group commander
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.68 that's Montgomery by the way after giving me my MC that's military cross ribbon he stepped back
01:17:26.24 --> 01:17:34.56 and said crispy patrolling his bloody isn't it when I stammered that it seemed a bit hard that
01:17:34.56 --> 01:17:42.08 it was always the same people chosen for patrols he replied with a twinkle as I one day you'll
01:17:42.08 --> 01:17:50.80 command a battalion and you'll understand the problem for 20 year old subaltern exchange like this
01:17:50.80 --> 01:17:55.12 with a field marshal was heavy stuff but Monti's mischievous humor and utter lack of
01:17:55.12 --> 01:18:01.84 formosity coupled with a single-minded professionalism extended his personal influence to the
01:18:01.84 --> 01:18:12.56 most junior soldier in 21st Army group we felt we knew him and that he knew us often he did so
01:18:14.80 --> 01:18:22.48 that's a great little interaction you know he says patrolling his bloody work isn't it and and
01:18:23.44 --> 01:18:29.68 Sydney Jerry says yeah and the thing is it seems like it's always the same platoons that get made to
01:18:29.68 --> 01:18:34.96 do the patrolling and he says one day when you're in charge of battalion you'll understand why that is
01:18:36.32 --> 01:18:39.68 and the reason why that is because you got the good guy and that's the guy you're going to send out
01:18:40.64 --> 01:18:43.04 you're going to rely on the people that get it done
01:18:49.20 --> 01:18:53.52 well this is an interesting we got another patrol that they're getting ready to have to go out on
01:18:53.52 --> 01:19:00.08 and the patrol was to probe between the roads and advance if possible as far as the forest
01:19:00.72 --> 01:19:06.000 beyond this its purpose was indeed vague Douglas called me and another platoon commander to
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.88 company HQ and explained it to us he then suggested we should toss a coin for an embarrassing
01:19:12.88 --> 01:19:19.44 situation arose I thought that the winner would lead the patrol the other officer anticipated that
01:19:19.44 --> 01:19:25.60 the loser would I lost the toss and got the job so so imagine that you and me are saying all right
01:19:25.60 --> 01:19:30.88 there's a dangerous patrol we're going to have to do let's flip for it I'm thinking heads
01:19:32.08 --> 01:19:37.04 if I win I get to do the patrol you're thinking if you win you don't have to do the patrol
01:19:40.24 --> 01:19:43.92 not everyone was quite as fired up I guess this is Sydney Jerry was
01:19:43.92 --> 01:19:55.28 and they they wrap up a relatively kind of un-eventful patrol relatively un-eventful patrol
01:19:56.40 --> 01:20:02.72 and he returns and they're having a cup of tea and some biscuits in true British form
01:20:03.44 --> 01:20:07.52 back to the book it was then that I suddenly realized that I've been commanding 18 platoon for three months
01:20:08.24 --> 01:20:13.68 to be precise three months and two days before I'd join the battalion in mid-July I'd been
01:20:13.68 --> 01:20:21.52 worn that my life expectancy would be about three weeks it seemed strange to me now but at no
01:20:21.52 --> 01:20:28.16 time did I anticipate being either wounded or killed I was just too busy for thoughts like
01:20:28.16 --> 01:20:34.48 reason and I'd become totally absorbed in my grim responsibilities in July I'd been ridden
01:20:35.20 --> 01:20:43.04 by doubt about my ability in my innocence I'd expected success in battle to be the
01:20:43.04 --> 01:20:54.72 prerogative of a Victor Lodorum which is like the champion I now had no such doubts or illusions
01:20:54.72 --> 01:21:02.16 furthermore I discovered just how much soldiers present and fear a young officer who sees battle
01:21:02.16 --> 01:21:10.24 as a means to win his spurs possibly at the cost of their lives so when you grow
01:21:10.24 --> 01:21:16.000 in and you're Mr. beating your chests and you're you're gonna prove yourself to the world
01:21:17.28 --> 01:21:24.64 yeah don't be that guy because you're gonna write checks with my life and we don't like that
01:21:27.52 --> 01:21:32.80 my duty had become clear to me it was to command 18 platoon with quiet confidence
01:21:32.80 --> 01:21:41.84 providing I made them only once my mistakes would be forgiven if my soldiers were to go
01:21:41.84 --> 01:21:48.32 we're going to place their very lives in my hands they in return were fired of me a
01:21:48.32 --> 01:21:57.68 serious attitude to my profession if I could achieve this with a light touch so much the better
01:21:57.68 --> 01:22:05.36 that's an interesting comment so you know he's saying look what they require is I got to be
01:22:05.36 --> 01:22:11.52 serious I got to be a serious as possible and it's like it's like it's like it's heard the term
01:22:11.52 --> 01:22:15.44 minimum force required yes yeah you probably probably use that as a balancer right
01:22:15.44 --> 01:22:19.20 hey you got to use the minimum force required so what he's saying is that as a leader
01:22:20.24 --> 01:22:25.20 the lighter touch the better the lightest touch you can use to lead is better that's
01:22:25.20 --> 01:22:31.60 pretty cool statement that's a good thing to think about how can you lead with minimum force
01:22:32.48 --> 01:22:40.24 every time you go you need to use more than you then you need your your over-exerting right
01:22:43.28 --> 01:22:48.16 and who knows what kind of you know you're taking away initiative you might be stamping out
01:22:48.16 --> 01:22:56.80 morale so lead with that minimum touch I like that so and this point they're in a
01:22:58.16 --> 01:23:04.80 they're in a position and there's three of these mark three 75 millimeter self-propelled
01:23:04.80 --> 01:23:09.68 assault guns so they kind of look like tanks they got big tracks their Germans their German
01:23:09.68 --> 01:23:13.76 and their and they're sitting out in front of them they're in a they're in a static position
01:23:13.76 --> 01:23:20.40 the companies in the static position and there's these these tanks sitting there three of them
01:23:21.52 --> 01:23:26.24 and Douglas looks at them and he's thinking himself hey I don't know what does they they look like
01:23:26.24 --> 01:23:33.28 they're functioning they don't look damaged and so Douglas is saying okay well we need to find
01:23:33.28 --> 01:23:37.12 out what's going on even if there's no one even if there's no one in them right now it could be
01:23:37.12 --> 01:23:46.96 a place where they use snipers later so someone's got to go check them out so Sydney Jerry the guy
01:23:47.52 --> 01:23:52.24 he goes out alone kind of sneaks out there he does stuff alone a little bit more often
01:23:52.80 --> 01:23:57.52 actually does stuff alone there's another story I didn't mention but at one point
01:23:58.48 --> 01:24:03.44 their he hears noise look one of the guy's reports it's nighttime and they hear the
01:24:03.44 --> 01:24:07.76 hear noise in this field they think there's enemy out there and he's like well there's one way to
01:24:07.76 --> 01:24:14.16 find out so he I think he does grab another guy in this occasion but he goes out and he's going through
01:24:14.16 --> 01:24:20.16 this field and it's like a corn field or something and he can't see and he's horrified and he
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:25.36 he's trying to think of a reason to quit he's like I just want to go back this isn't smart
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.28 and as he's as this is taking place and this is fear is climaxing all of a sudden he hears
01:24:31.28 --> 01:24:41.52 oh, bunch of cows that have fielded right so he's doing another solo operation here
01:24:42.80 --> 01:24:47.84 trying to find out what these tank like assault guns are doing out there back to the book
01:24:47.84 --> 01:24:54.56 climbing up above the tracks I put my head into the coupla which was open a familiar
01:24:54.56 --> 01:25:02.56 interrible stench hit me inside was a sharnell house six inches away a set of bear teeth
01:25:02.56 --> 01:25:11.60 set in unrecognizable black and incinerated lump grinned it me beside it a charred and bony arm
01:25:11.60 --> 01:25:19.36 reached up in agony spread on the floor like a pool of tar lay the melted remains of the driver
01:25:19.36 --> 01:25:30.24 I had entered Dante's inferno my head reeled and with my mouth knows and lungs filled with the
01:25:30.24 --> 01:25:38.32 stench of death I fell back to the ground although unmarked by fire on all on our side all three
01:25:38.32 --> 01:25:43.28 assault guns had brood up and were blackened on their sides which faced the enemy
01:25:43.28 --> 01:25:50.24 with no stomach to look further I ran back to the company for getting to look for American minds
01:25:51.76 --> 01:25:55.36 never again did I look into a knocked-out tank or self-propelled gun
01:25:56.56 --> 01:26:03.52 I reported to Douglas that nobody in the right mind would use them for an observation post or for any other purpose
01:26:06.24 --> 01:26:12.24 later that day he asked that's Douglas Douglas asked the commander of a Sherman tank to fire some
01:26:12.24 --> 01:26:17.76 armor piercing shells into each of them positioning his tank hold down beside 16
01:26:17.76 --> 01:26:22.72 platoon positions which were two are left the tank commanders the tank commander first
01:26:22.72 --> 01:26:28.88 selected the assault gun I had visited his first shell hit it slightly above the tracks
01:26:29.68 --> 01:26:37.44 like the hammer of Vulcan a red glow blossomed on the armor plate around the point of entry and
01:26:37.44 --> 01:26:43.92 slowly faded it was followed by a second and third shell until a morage of heat appeared above it
01:26:43.92 --> 01:26:49.28 and for a second time the funeral pyre blazed with an incandescent ferocity
01:26:50.72 --> 01:26:56.24 the Sherman gunner then turned his attention to the next assault gun which despite being penetrated by
01:26:56.24 --> 01:27:03.36 about six armor piercing rounds failed to brew up his first shot at the third caused a massive
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:10.72 internal detonation no doubt due to amination stacked within a volcano erupted from its coppola
01:27:11.44 --> 01:27:18.48 sending a dense cloud of black smoke and red sparks into the air a truly
01:27:19.12 --> 01:27:24.40 wagonarian end for the warriors entuned within but it revolted me
01:27:24.40 --> 01:27:34.08 for the rest of the day I brooded this communicated itself to my nco's and soldiers who stole
01:27:34.08 --> 01:27:37.92 mystified glances at my grief for an unknown enemy
01:27:39.60 --> 01:27:45.04 during the afternoon I wandered across the road to a lone house where Dennis Clark had his observation post
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.64 I was looking for solace from a wise and good friend
01:27:48.64 --> 01:27:54.000 a post was filled with gunner officers there must have been a dozen of them
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.32 setting up their equipment and preparation for an attack by 214 brigade
01:27:59.60 --> 01:28:02.40 this activity precluded any solace for me
01:28:04.32 --> 01:28:11.68 immature and undisciplined my imagination ran riot what were they like these men whose already
01:28:11.68 --> 01:28:18.32 incinerated remains had been blasted into oblivion by the 75 millimeter shells of our
01:28:18.32 --> 01:28:28.24 friend in the Sherman my attitude to war was ambivalent undoubtedly I was part pacifist
01:28:28.24 --> 01:28:33.92 but despite an abysmal record in mathematics and particularly in geometry I was
01:28:33.92 --> 01:28:40.64 moderately logical for my age this clearly ruled out total dedication to pacifism
01:28:42.08 --> 01:28:47.04 I had previously discussed the concept of conscious objection with clergy of all
01:28:47.04 --> 01:28:51.36 denominations but none of them could give me constructive answers to my questions
01:28:54.64 --> 01:28:58.40 the privations and suffering of 18 putoon hurt me
01:29:00.64 --> 01:29:06.16 an infantry subaltern is faced with a conflict which cannot be resolved
01:29:08.24 --> 01:29:12.48 one gets emotionally involved with those under one's command
01:29:12.48 --> 01:29:20.56 without this bond few men will respond and consequently little can be achieved
01:29:22.88 --> 01:29:31.20 however to win battles decisions have to be taken and orders given which at times may seem to be
01:29:31.20 --> 01:29:33.12 a betrayal of this trust
01:29:35.60 --> 01:29:41.04 before battle the commander must exude confidence and enthusiasm
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:48.56 whatever fears his private thoughts may hold just how thin the line divides this
01:29:48.56 --> 01:29:55.12 from deliberate deception I call it the commander's dilemma
01:29:56.24 --> 01:30:00.08 a pretentious phrase but there is nothing to be done about it
01:30:02.64 --> 01:30:09.28 the Nicholas Montserrat's book the cruel sea poor commander Eric Itson makes the point with
01:30:09.28 --> 01:30:20.40 poignancy it's the war the whole bloody war we've just got to do these things and say our prayers at the end
01:30:24.08 --> 01:30:27.20 there was another side possibly caused by adrenaline
01:30:29.20 --> 01:30:37.60 danger attracted and excited me I felt elated and until the battle was over I was impervious to
01:30:37.60 --> 01:30:44.40 exhaustion commanding a platoon embattled demands not only a clear mind but also considerable
01:30:44.40 --> 01:30:53.28 emotional force I suspected is the same transmitted force that exists between a conductor and
01:30:53.28 --> 01:31:04.16 orchestra 40 years later the dilemma of my ambivalence is still unresolved I find the suffering
01:31:04.16 --> 01:31:09.84 inflicted by war unacceptable particularly amongst women children and animals
01:31:12.32 --> 01:31:18.56 thank God I was spared the horrific sights at felays on some days I am a pacifist
01:31:20.32 --> 01:31:27.04 and yet I'm still attracted by the sounds of guns and but for an extraordinarily happy marriage
01:31:27.04 --> 01:31:35.92 would have found it difficult to resist the lore of soldiering
01:31:38.48 --> 01:31:47.44 so what he calls the commanders dilemma this one I call the dichotomy of leadership and that one is the
01:31:47.44 --> 01:32:01.60 premier of them all and that is as a leader as a combat leader you are going to love your men
01:32:04.64 --> 01:32:13.92 and care about them more than anything else in the world and with that you are going to
01:32:13.92 --> 01:32:23.04 make decisions and make plans where you are sending those men into a situation where they can be wounded
01:32:23.04 --> 01:32:33.84 or killed and that's it and that is the ultimate dichotomy of leadership that is the hardest one to balance
01:32:33.84 --> 01:32:50.000 it back to the book a new officer arrived named Humphrey's he used to play cricket for warstisher
01:32:51.68 --> 01:32:56.40 he came on the same day that sergeant Oxlyn received a well-earned commission in the field
01:32:56.40 --> 01:33:02.96 Douglas told him about sergeant Oxlyn and with great consideration he went to 17
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:10.88 platoon's position to offer his congratulations while they talked just one salvo of one oh five
01:33:10.88 --> 01:33:18.40 straddled them one shell fell into second lieutenant Oxlyn's slit trench and both were killed instantly
01:33:18.40 --> 01:33:28.64 like me can Oxlyn has survived five months Humphrey's survives not a full day
01:33:32.08 --> 01:33:36.80 is there a mathematical formula by which survival can be calculated
01:33:39.20 --> 01:33:46.96 who are the survivors and can they be recognized over the past 40 years I've often pondered this
01:33:46.96 --> 01:33:54.56 but still offer no real answer I suspect however that is something to do with attitude attitude
01:33:54.56 --> 01:34:02.08 seems to me to be a parameter which restricts not only our relationships but also our creative effort
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.52 further comment is on wise Humphrey's one cargue had little time to develop an attitude
01:34:11.52 --> 01:34:20.08 to our kind of existence undoubtedly a self-fulfilling circle develops newcomers inexperienced in the
01:34:20.08 --> 01:34:28.16 perils of the battlefield suffered the highest casualties knowledge of what can and what cannot be
01:34:28.16 --> 01:34:37.20 wrists post-pones the fatal reckoning for the soldier for the commander however junior battle
01:34:37.20 --> 01:34:42.88 field experience will not only protect himself but also all those under his command
01:34:46.72 --> 01:34:54.24 and that's that's why training is so important it's so important and that's why when I got
01:34:54.24 --> 01:34:59.28 done with you know deployment to her body that's why I went to training because I knew that right there
01:35:01.04 --> 01:35:04.48 and I was thinking you know I didn't know I was wrong the war was going to last and when we left
01:35:04.48 --> 01:35:10.96 for money where money was still horrible and when the task unit came in relieved us man they were
01:35:10.96 --> 01:35:16.24 getting after it and I didn't know long that was going to last I mean it ended up not lasting that
01:35:16.24 --> 01:35:23.36 much longer that kind of intense fighting but it was impossible to tell at that time we would just
01:35:23.36 --> 01:35:29.84 barely seeing stuff start to get better at the end of our deployment just barely starting to see
01:35:29.84 --> 01:35:44.000 the first indications of that back to the book the fifth Duke of Cornwall's light infantry
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.92 had attempted to attack Hove and village through these ghastly woods and had taken heavy casualties
01:35:50.96 --> 01:35:57.12 their reign soaked bodies littered the paths and clearings while carrying out a reconnaissance I
01:35:57.12 --> 01:36:02.72 came across one of their sections lying along a small path facing the enemy
01:36:04.16 --> 01:36:08.48 at first I fought them alive until I saw that the studs on their boots were rusty
01:36:09.12 --> 01:36:15.84 and their webbing equipment was bleached with rain their battle dress was starched with mud
01:36:15.84 --> 01:36:23.52 and their hands and faces were green German booby traps were on or near many of the tracks
01:36:23.52 --> 01:36:29.28 and I was told by the company commander of the fourth wheelchairs from whom we took over the position
01:36:29.28 --> 01:36:35.36 that some of the bodies were also booby trapped don't try to bury them he said
01:36:37.20 --> 01:36:42.08 I was temporarily commanding the company because Douglas had been given a well deserved leave in
01:36:42.08 --> 01:36:48.80 Brussels although militarily comparatively un-adventful Hove and has a special place in my memories
01:36:48.80 --> 01:36:54.96 it was without doubt my most the most grizzly and horrifying position that we ever hold held
01:36:54.96 --> 01:37:00.24 but more importantly it was the place of private Charles Raven's triumph
01:37:02.80 --> 01:37:08.80 Raven had fought in all our battles since hill 112 which to him was a yardstick of horror
01:37:10.08 --> 01:37:14.40 all subsequent experience was compared with that his first battle
01:37:14.40 --> 01:37:23.76 he was no soldier I doubt if he influenced greatly any of the skirmishes and counters or battles
01:37:23.76 --> 01:37:29.68 in which he took part sometimes he was frightened and he was so out of place on the battlefield
01:37:29.68 --> 01:37:36.80 that I often wondered how he became an infantry soldier before the war he had been a clerk in north
01:37:36.80 --> 01:37:44.96 London I'm sure he was a conscientious and loyal employee and a considerate and loving husband
01:37:44.96 --> 01:37:53.84 for unlike most of us he was married Raven had hidden depths and could be inspired
01:37:54.96 --> 01:38:00.88 once in Normandy during a nasty little platoon attack up a sunken lane 18 platoon was held up by
01:38:00.88 --> 01:38:07.68 the inevitable unlocated spandows straining my eyes through binoculars I was trying
01:38:07.68 --> 01:38:14.16 vainly to locate these guns when I was handed a steaming mug of tea he should have been
01:38:14.16 --> 01:38:21.84 observing to his front but judging the moment right he had brewed a mess tin of tea on a solid fuel stove
01:38:21.84 --> 01:38:31.68 by any standards this was an inspired act he was considerate with our reinforcements pale
01:38:31.68 --> 01:38:37.36 unsure men some of whom until recently it served in the royal artillery and it been transferred
01:38:37.36 --> 01:38:42.72 to infantry regiments to replace the appalling losses incurred in the Normandy Bocage
01:38:44.80 --> 01:38:50.08 beside them Raven looked bronze in weather beaten a hardened campaigner
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:57.36 complete with a German luger pistol to prove it some of the platoon regaled the reinforcements
01:38:57.36 --> 01:39:04.64 with horrible tails from Normandy and else as little more than a schoolboy I found these stories
01:39:04.64 --> 01:39:16.16 amusing Raven did not fear for him was horribly real and never to be joked about he developed a
01:39:16.16 --> 01:39:21.52 eternal attitude toward the newer and younger soldiers a relationship devoid of patronage
01:39:21.52 --> 01:39:30.08 but essentially one of kindly understanding he spoke to me about it when I thanked him for his help
01:39:31.36 --> 01:39:38.000 I admit I'm dead windy sir his extraordinary honesty with himself and the rest of the platoon
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.44 forbade him to attempt to hide the fact Raven in overtaxed his nervous and physical resources
01:39:45.44 --> 01:39:52.96 long before we arrived in hoven woods after two days in the position he came to me late one
01:39:52.96 --> 01:40:00.08 evening and asked my permission to report sick the following morning I suppose I should
01:40:00.08 --> 01:40:05.04 and fettically have refused but something made me hesitate and avoid dealing directly with the
01:40:05.04 --> 01:40:10.64 situation I said simply all right Raven but do come see me before you leave
01:40:10.64 --> 01:40:21.84 he didn't come the matter was never again mentioned I can only surmised the struggle which
01:40:21.84 --> 01:40:27.68 rage in his mind all that night while he crouched in his waterlogs slit trunch peering into the
01:40:27.68 --> 01:40:38.40 sinister darkness of the wood I do know however that in hoven wood a considerable moral triumph
01:40:38.40 --> 01:40:46.64 over stark horror was achieved by a good man unequipped for nature unequipped by nature for war
01:40:48.24 --> 01:40:58.16 in my view the bravest of the brave so that guy Raven had been through all this stuff and
01:40:58.16 --> 01:41:04.08 just barely held the line and finally he was going to break finally he was going to break
01:41:04.08 --> 01:41:10.80 and he comes to city gerian says hey I'm gonna go sick tomorrow send the gerian says okay come
01:41:10.80 --> 01:41:15.52 and see me before you go it doesn't come back it doesn't come back to him doesn't go sick
01:41:19.12 --> 01:41:25.04 back to the book infantry warfare is wretched business it makes physical and emotional demands
01:41:25.04 --> 01:41:32.32 on participants that run contrary to all human instinct the strong minority must quietly help
01:41:32.32 --> 01:41:39.76 the weak majority to me that is the essence of good teamwork and that jewel in the crown of the
01:41:39.76 --> 01:41:47.04 British army the regimental system is the strong foundation upon which we all knowingly or unknowingly
01:41:47.04 --> 01:41:57.04 relied so there's going to be some people that deal with it better than others
01:41:57.04 --> 01:42:10.32 and you got to help um here's a situation they set up early warning flares so little trip wires
01:42:11.44 --> 01:42:18.64 in case to to notify them if the enemies move and down one of their flanks and here we go back to the
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:22.56 book after about 10 minutes had passed we heard the popping of mortars behind hoven village in a
01:42:22.56 --> 01:42:27.92 concentration of bombs fell in the fields where we had laid the flares suddenly our left flank
01:42:27.92 --> 01:42:35.12 was vividly illuminated as flair after flair ignited knowing little about these flares we had laid
01:42:35.12 --> 01:42:40.80 them with the trip wires to talk had we allowed a degree of slack the flares were not a
01:42:40.80 --> 01:42:51.44 vergnited my fault I should have known had to fill the extreme ownership from Sydney Jerry and therefore y'all
01:42:56.32 --> 01:43:03.60 now he's talking about the attitudes of the soldiers and how soldiers you know there was a
01:43:03.60 --> 01:43:09.04 claim he read an article years after the war that said that people you know people became brutal
01:43:09.04 --> 01:43:17.68 from the from the war and here's what he says back to the book does war brutalize one can only
01:43:17.68 --> 01:43:24.24 speak from personal experience but I think not certainly no soldier of mine was made brutal rather the
01:43:24.24 --> 01:43:32.40 opposite war developed in 18 puttune consideration for comrades and humanity towards civilians
01:43:32.40 --> 01:43:39.76 and prisoners of war I was proud of my soldiers then and this sentiment has increased with the passing
01:43:39.76 --> 01:43:46.72 of years I would not suggest that the naturally brutal might not find in war and outland for their
01:43:46.72 --> 01:43:54.56 brutality however that war does not brutalize the type of decent man the type of decent and fair-minded
01:43:54.56 --> 01:44:02.16 young English men whom I had the very great honor to command we were not an aggressive generation
01:44:02.16 --> 01:44:06.80 a fact which may explain my failure to understand some present day attitudes in the armed
01:44:06.80 --> 01:44:15.44 services particularly in the royal marines and the parachute regimen possibly a degree of personal
01:44:15.44 --> 01:44:21.28 aggression is appropriate in troops are who are committed to battle for comparatively short periods
01:44:21.28 --> 01:44:27.92 like the marines and the paras when the success of an operation depends on ultra rapid action
01:44:27.92 --> 01:44:34.48 however in my experience troops lose personal aggression after about two months in battle
01:44:35.84 --> 01:44:42.08 after three months they acquire a mature compassion which in no way detracts from their offensive
01:44:42.08 --> 01:44:50.40 capability they simply know a lot more about war I would suggest that personal aggression should
01:44:50.40 --> 01:44:57.52 not be confused with offensive spirit based on professional competence and experience
01:44:59.84 --> 01:45:07.84 interesting take that aggression that you can maintain if you it's not going to last rubber
01:45:07.84 --> 01:45:20.96 and and then you're going to have to fall back on duty and and that mature compassion
01:45:20.96 --> 01:45:23.20 which isn't taken away from their offensive capability
01:45:29.60 --> 01:45:30.24 interesting
01:45:30.24 --> 01:45:40.80 back to book on the eleventh of January we returned to the south of the union just to go back
01:45:40.80 --> 01:45:46.48 to that one piece right there dichotomy leadership there's a dichotomy and everything and
01:45:46.48 --> 01:45:52.72 you know obviously I'm a big proponent of being aggressive and I also always talk about the fact
01:45:52.72 --> 01:45:58.000 that there is such a thing being too aggressive you're running to your death no not a good idea
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.64 not a good idea and there's probably a good chance that when he talks about people
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:09.20 after two months of combat everyone starts to develop a different type of attitude also
01:46:09.20 --> 01:46:14.48 the people that were ultra aggressive didn't make it like the like the leader that he talked about
01:46:14.48 --> 01:46:18.48 that was strutting around the guy was ultra aggressive didn't care about anything and he's dead
01:46:20.32 --> 01:46:24.88 so there's a balance you got to have that's the dichotomy leadership that's why the dichotomy
01:46:24.88 --> 01:46:34.08 of leadership is so important and so hard to understand back to the book on the day after the
01:46:34.08 --> 01:46:39.28 batain was relieved and hoven wood someone I suspect I suspect it was the adjutant
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:48.000 Tim Watson decided that I should enjoy 48 hours on leave in Antwerp I was overjoyed
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.80 the large hotel although faded was still plush and filled with officers including women
01:46:54.80 --> 01:46:58.88 ATS officers from the various base units stationed in the city
01:46:59.84 --> 01:47:03.68 dressed as I had left the battlefield I was both the shavold and soiled
01:47:04.72 --> 01:47:10.32 surrounded by the residents many of whom were in service dress I could not have felt more isolated and
01:47:10.32 --> 01:47:18.64 lonely so he's getting some leave time but he's showing up off the battlefield to grimey my first
01:47:18.64 --> 01:47:24.08 map visit was to a magnificent white marble gentleman's hair dressing salon in the basement of a hotel
01:47:25.20 --> 01:47:30.32 without a word the barber washed and rinsed my hair twice before touching it with his precious
01:47:30.32 --> 01:47:38.16 scissors and clippers I remember the feeling of well-being as climbing the stairs I returned to my room
01:47:38.16 --> 01:47:46.64 Next I took three very hot baths one after the other to rid myself of grime both physical
01:47:47.20 --> 01:47:55.60 and emotional I think I must have slept for 14 hours before I rose shaved took another bath
01:47:55.92 --> 01:47:57.60 and decided to explore the city
01:47:59.84 --> 01:48:06.88 A rather creased battle dress was my best suit and in this I descended the main staircase into
01:48:06.88 --> 01:48:13.20 the lounge which was filled with the resident officers all of whom seemed to be a knowingly self-assured
01:48:15.52 --> 01:48:22.96 I met a barrier I had walked out of a world that I knew into one where I was desperately
01:48:22.96 --> 01:48:34.48 unsure of myself away from the battlefield this world had no place for me I did not go out to lunch
01:48:34.48 --> 01:48:40.000 go to night clubs or meet the girls who were everywhere seemed to be canvassing
01:48:40.96 --> 01:48:48.80 for these establishments I had wandered too far into dark and smokey battlefields across the
01:48:48.80 --> 01:48:54.80 sticks to find solace or comfort in the bright lights behind the black-out curtains of Antwerp
01:48:54.80 --> 01:49:05.68 I long to return to the battalion and to 18-platoon which without my knowing it had become my home
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:15.12 with a light heart a clean body freshly laundered clothes and refreshed by hours of unbroken
01:49:15.12 --> 01:49:18.80 sleep I gladly climbed into the three-ton truck that took me there
01:49:18.80 --> 01:49:24.96 years later I found the same problem after I left the army
01:49:26.80 --> 01:49:32.000 Antwerp had been a small taste of the real world and as anyone who has served with good
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:39.68 soldiers on grim battlefields will confirm afterwards real life never seems real again
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:50.88 later there was no 18-platoon to slink back to and without a loving wife it would have proved
01:49:50.88 --> 01:50:06.24 intolerable well that's the feeling that that we get when you get done doing that job
01:50:06.24 --> 01:50:18.32 and real life never seems real again in comparison I know the vets that are listening to
01:50:18.32 --> 01:50:25.20 understand that part back to the book on 11 January we returned to the South of Holland this time
01:50:25.20 --> 01:50:34.16 to ganglet snow lay on deeply frozen ground and life for the entry and life for the infantry
01:50:34.16 --> 01:50:41.12 manning their slit trenches became unbearable again the battalion front was extensive
01:50:41.12 --> 01:50:45.12 decomponing was in reserve closed close to battalion headquarters on the edge of town
01:50:46.24 --> 01:50:52.000 fortunately gangl it was on a reverse slope which allowed us to move freely during daylight hours
01:50:53.44 --> 01:50:59.92 the cold was penetrating the oil in our automatic weapons froze and until anti-free's
01:50:59.92 --> 01:51:07.04 lubricants were issued our brands were useless holding a wide front with large gaps between
01:51:07.04 --> 01:51:12.48 our company positions necessitated putting out many standing patrols particularly at night
01:51:14.16 --> 01:51:19.04 the privations suffered by these small patrols usually a corpile and three or four men
01:51:19.04 --> 01:51:25.84 were harder than the rest of us some had hallucinations and if you were exactly evacuated
01:51:25.84 --> 01:51:32.32 suffering from exposure keeping fit warm and clean became a great effort
01:51:33.52 --> 01:51:37.84 conversation dried up the platoon became quiet but never merouse
01:51:39.28 --> 01:51:43.52 at one stage I decided they needed cheering up and I wandered around the section post
01:51:43.52 --> 01:51:49.60 ready to chat with all of them it was quite unnecessary I had wrongly judged their mood
01:51:49.60 --> 01:51:55.28 they just wanted to be left alone
01:52:01.52 --> 01:52:07.52 now there's a begin by the book and read the book there's a chaotic battle at a
01:52:07.52 --> 01:52:13.12 pace place called cleave and after the battle at cleave he kind of de-briefs here
01:52:13.76 --> 01:52:18.000 back to the book what instructors at the school of infantry would think about the fighting
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.60 cleave I shuttered a think there resembled no other battle in my experience I had little control
01:52:23.60 --> 01:52:29.60 and it developed into a section commander's battle looking back over the years it seems military
01:52:29.60 --> 01:52:33.44 the totally unprofessional a real wild west chewed out
01:52:34.72 --> 01:52:40.32 tactically the Germans had every advantage we were strung out in a long column amid shattered
01:52:40.32 --> 01:52:45.92 buildings and piles of rubbles with the groups of parachute troops attacking from both sides
01:52:45.92 --> 01:52:50.56 they could sniper us and engage with our with their spandals
01:52:51.92 --> 01:52:55.68 from dozens of positions totally hidden by piles of rubble
01:52:57.36 --> 01:53:02.24 they had the opportunity to concentrate their counter attacks on the narrowest of fronts
01:53:02.24 --> 01:53:06.56 but failed to do to do so so they failed to focus their efforts
01:53:07.28 --> 01:53:13.20 I can only assume that we had the psychological advantage the circumstances being so chaotic and disorganized
01:53:13.20 --> 01:53:18.40 perhaps being Germans they could not overcome their instinct for organization and tightiness
01:53:20.48 --> 01:53:25.92 in the end they departed possibly and discussed leaving us undisputed victors
01:53:33.60 --> 01:53:37.84 on another attack the Germans at this point are retreating
01:53:38.64 --> 01:53:40.48 and they can see that they're retreating
01:53:40.48 --> 01:53:43.92 fearing that the retreating parachute troops would make a stand on the edge of the wood
01:53:43.92 --> 01:53:49.68 I increased the rate of advance joining Lance Corporal Portius in the forward section
01:53:50.88 --> 01:53:55.20 running across the level crossing I suddenly found myself face to face with a germinplatoon
01:53:55.20 --> 01:54:01.76 complete with MG 34 fortunately the gun was mounted on a tripod which was unusual
01:54:01.76 --> 01:54:07.44 and could not be traversed in our direction from a drainage channel on the left of the road
01:54:07.44 --> 01:54:14.80 a parachute is leaped up swath and camouflage veil pointing a schmiser at me from about 10 yards range
01:54:14.80 --> 01:54:18.40 he fired a whole magazine of about 30 rounds
01:54:19.76 --> 01:54:24.80 it was like watching a slow running silent movie I didn't hear the chatter of the schmiser
01:54:24.80 --> 01:54:30.40 but I do remember seeing the stream of empty cartridge cases fly from the German machine gun
01:54:30.40 --> 01:54:37.20 miracles do indeed happen one nine millimeter bullet went through my beret
01:54:38.56 --> 01:54:46.64 missing my head literally by hairs with another went under the appleet of my jacket
01:54:46.64 --> 01:54:51.92 penetrating the webbing across brace the webbing cross brace of my equipment and grazing my
01:54:51.92 --> 01:54:56.88 right shoulder a third bullet ricochet off the surface of the road and disintegrated
01:54:56.88 --> 01:55:03.76 the jacket finally lodging in the palm of my right hand then came the anti climax
01:55:04.56 --> 01:55:10.32 the German looked at me in amazement through ways smiser and eye with a shrug of the shoulders
01:55:10.32 --> 01:55:18.64 he surrendered my natural relation was short lived behind me lay Lance Corporal Portius
01:55:19.68 --> 01:55:26.56 shot through the heart some of the German platoon ran away across the open fields to our
01:55:26.56 --> 01:55:32.88 left and were cut down by rapid fire brand gun by sergeant Kingston section
01:55:33.92 --> 01:55:39.28 which now line the railway track to left the road the remainder of the enemy came towards us
01:55:39.28 --> 01:55:44.88 over the level crossing with their hands raised we took 57 prisoners
01:55:49.84 --> 01:55:54.48 now they're moving along and they are clearing some cottages and they get to this one cottage
01:55:54.48 --> 01:55:59.36 filled with rough wooden bunks it had obviously served as an air raid shelter the house having
01:55:59.36 --> 01:56:04.72 been found clear of enemy jackly was off as guard as he descended the steps suddenly from under a
01:56:04.72 --> 01:56:11.36 pile of blankets left the fanatical German paratrooper the only fanatical German paratrooper we encountered
01:56:11.36 --> 01:56:16.16 the entire battle a large manny sees jack around the throat in an attempt to strangle him
01:56:16.72 --> 01:56:23.60 private fluid rose to the challenge in a bound he was down the steps and with a mighty lunge
01:56:23.60 --> 01:56:30.08 transfixed the German on his bayonet a brave lad he undoubtedly saved Lance Corporal
01:56:30.08 --> 01:56:37.76 Lee's life just eight days before losing his own the German was indeed unlucky as it was the only
01:56:37.76 --> 01:56:44.96 occasion throughout the campaign on which 18 pltunes bayonets were bloodied we usually use them to
01:56:44.96 --> 01:56:53.36 open food cans having checked the pltune positions and arcs of fire for the brins exhaustion
01:56:53.36 --> 01:57:00.24 hit me i fell into a deep sleep during the evening a senior officer i understand it was either
01:57:00.24 --> 01:57:06.000 brigade or divisional commander came out to my company position when he asked to speak to me sergeant
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.48 Kingston refused to have me wakened i'm sure that Jim was the most diplomatic about it but it says
01:57:12.48 --> 01:57:28.40 much for our visitors humanity that he let it go by another attack a and c companies were
01:57:28.40 --> 01:57:34.08 unleashed and passing b company secured their objectives against some opposition
01:57:34.88 --> 01:57:39.04 there was now our turn d company advanced across the flat open fields
01:57:39.04 --> 01:57:47.20 down the left hand side of the main road into zan ten it's a name of the city
01:57:48.48 --> 01:57:52.64 village casualties from the preceding companies in the opposition lay all around
01:57:53.28 --> 01:57:59.44 about 300 yards short of the town were extremely accurately engaged by a battery of 105s
01:58:00.16 --> 01:58:04.64 some of their shells exploded on the hard surface the road your splitting detonations
01:58:04.64 --> 01:58:11.12 and frightening fragmentation pieces of shell casing hummed and wind around us one trolling peace
01:58:11.12 --> 01:58:15.52 embedded itself with a foot into the trunk of a tree a few inches from my right ear
01:58:16.72 --> 01:58:20.96 was the only time in the whole campaign when i regretted throwing away my steel helmet
01:58:23.20 --> 01:58:29.52 i think it was the accuracy and the intense noise of the shelling that caused it one of 18
01:58:29.52 --> 01:58:35.84 pertunes lance corpoles a big man who had served honorably since market garden went to pieces
01:58:37.20 --> 01:58:42.72 there was a pathetic site and to everyone's credit he was quietly removed from the battle
01:58:44.48 --> 01:58:47.68 he had passed his limit and nothing more can be said
01:58:51.92 --> 01:58:57.20 so you don't know these guys are brave at one moment and then a week a month two months
01:58:57.20 --> 01:58:59.76 four months they can't do it anymore
01:59:05.60 --> 01:59:11.28 they get across the line now they're fully in Germany there's a little bit of a low in the
01:59:11.28 --> 01:59:16.08 fighting back to the book early one morning while we were waiting for our supporting armor to arrive
01:59:16.08 --> 01:59:22.48 our podry john Williams drove over to see us after wandering around the platoon for a chat he
01:59:22.48 --> 01:59:28.40 suggested he suggested that we should go for a short stroll i had now been commanding 18
01:59:28.40 --> 01:59:37.28 platoon for over eight months and i suspect that our agitant Tim Watson a kindly soul had asked him
01:59:37.28 --> 01:59:45.04 to find out what shape i was in we had not gone far into the next field when he came across
01:59:45.04 --> 01:59:50.64 some grizzly remnants one of our artillery shells must have exploded right at the feet of a
01:59:50.64 --> 01:59:57.92 German soldier who had been digging a slit trench his splintered and twisted spade lay beside
01:59:59.12 --> 02:00:06.56 laid by the side of that half dug trench beside which was a small shell hole he had been
02:00:06.56 --> 02:00:11.04 disintegrated into small pieces of flesh and bone which they scattered all over the field
02:00:11.04 --> 02:00:18.56 had I been on my own I would no doubt have shuttered and quickly departed from this horror
02:00:20.96 --> 02:00:27.04 draped over a wire fence nearby lay a parachute which are extraordinarily brave podry
02:00:27.04 --> 02:00:34.88 spread out as a shroud on the cold and damp grass then stupid he walked around the field
02:00:34.88 --> 02:00:44.64 a lonely figure reverently picking up every piece of that poor soldier to my shame i stood and
02:00:44.64 --> 02:00:57.12 watched him i lacked the courage to help somewhere beneath those flat damp fields just north of the
02:00:57.12 --> 02:01:06.80 line that pallet it pathetic bundle must still lie
02:01:12.48 --> 02:01:21.84 now they're in attack again but it seems like things are going their way and we're going he's
02:01:21.84 --> 02:01:28.24 kind of giving a brief to his to his runner when all of a sudden he hears yelling back to the
02:01:28.24 --> 02:01:34.40 book sir they're charging us sure enough from about 150 yards ahead of well spread out line of
02:01:34.40 --> 02:01:41.20 about 20 Germans were putting in a bayonet charge brave lads they didn't stand a chance
02:01:41.20 --> 02:01:55.20 I gave no orders except cease fire not one got within 75 yards of us a few minutes later
02:01:55.20 --> 02:01:59.92 a possession of Germans with stretchers and a huge red flag emerged from the village behind
02:02:00.88 --> 02:02:05.28 when they were close to their casualties they hesitated so i stood up and waved them on
02:02:05.28 --> 02:02:11.60 all our unarmed stretcher bears and they moved across our front collecting their dead and wounded
02:02:13.44 --> 02:02:18.000 when they had finished their task of mercy one of them i think he must have been a German
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:26.16 medical officer turned and saluted in our direction i returned the salute and with that gesture
02:02:26.16 --> 02:02:36.08 the tiny battle of cinder and ended in bremen little over a month later one of our stretcher bears
02:02:36.08 --> 02:02:42.72 Lance Corporal J. Stevens was killed by a German grenade as he went to tend to wounded German soldier
02:02:42.72 --> 02:02:59.92 18 platoon remembering cinder and were justifiably outraged by such unsolderly behavior
02:03:00.80 --> 02:03:07.12 there is a mathematical formula aggression increases the further one goes behind the lines
02:03:07.12 --> 02:03:14.64 opposing infantry with few exceptions like the SS are joined by a natural bond of mutual compassion
02:03:14.64 --> 02:03:18.48 which few but the aristocracy of the battlefield can understand
02:03:20.40 --> 02:03:25.76 the public influence no doubt by writers with literal no experience of battle have strange and
02:03:25.76 --> 02:03:31.84 sometimes silly ideas about what makes a good soldier ill informed television programs
02:03:31.84 --> 02:03:38.08 of added to this misunderstanding few professions can be have been so misleadingly caricatured
02:03:39.76 --> 02:03:44.88 i had had i been asked at the time before august 1944 to list the personal characteristics
02:03:44.88 --> 02:03:49.68 which go to make a good infantry soldier my reply would indeed have been why to the mark
02:03:49.68 --> 02:03:56.08 why to the mark like most i know doubt one of suggested only masculine ones like aggression
02:03:56.08 --> 02:04:03.36 physical stamina a hunting instinct instinct and competitive nature how wrong i would have been
02:04:04.72 --> 02:04:14.48 i would now suggest the following firstly sufferance without which one could not survive so he's
02:04:14.48 --> 02:04:18.72 listing what he thinks the most important characteristics for a for an infantry soldier out of the first
02:04:18.72 --> 02:04:25.92 one is sufferance the ability to suffer secondly a quiet mind which enables a
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:30.72 soldier to live in harmony with his fellows through all sorts of difficulties and sometimes under
02:04:30.72 --> 02:04:39.68 dreadful conditions as in a closed monastic existence there's simply no room for the assertive
02:04:39.68 --> 02:04:49.68 or acrimonious thirdly below no less important a sense of the ridiculous which helps the soldiers
02:04:49.68 --> 02:04:57.20 are mount the unacceptable add to these a reasonable standard of physical fitness and a dedicated
02:04:57.20 --> 02:05:05.76 professional competence and you have a soldier for all seasons none of the soldiers or nco's who made
02:05:05.76 --> 02:05:11.44 18-platoon what it was resembled the characters portrayed in most books and films about war
02:05:11.44 --> 02:05:25.84 all quiet sensible unassuming and some by any standard were heroes if i now had to select a team
02:05:25.84 --> 02:05:32.48 for a dangerous mission and my choice was restricted to stars of the sports field or poets
02:05:32.48 --> 02:05:50.08 I would unhazitatingly recruit from the latter very interesting and i mean obviously you have to
02:05:50.08 --> 02:06:00.48 put this in the context of of his time but there's no doubt that i mean you get a sports star
02:06:00.48 --> 02:06:07.44 especially these days those guys that are getting paid 20 30 40 million dollars a year to play a
02:06:07.44 --> 02:06:13.44 game that they're probably not going to be the best at suffering and a trench
02:06:16.88 --> 02:06:23.04 interesting and i think the key point of that is what he's going back to what he talks about
02:06:23.04 --> 02:06:33.60 earlier is someone that can think someone that can think someone that is not trapped in in thinking
02:06:33.60 --> 02:06:40.64 the same faulty everyone else which certainly an artist or a poet has to be outside the box of normal
02:06:40.64 --> 02:06:53.20 fought otherwise they become that they don't become that right in this situation
02:06:55.52 --> 02:07:04.000 is platoon is kind of pinned down and there's an air raid shelter which has someone in it
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.16 is firing these things called a pans or files which is like a it's kind of like a bazooka or
02:07:08.16 --> 02:07:14.72 like an RPG looking thing and he sees where it's coming from and he sees that it's this shelter
02:07:16.40 --> 02:07:20.40 but he doesn't know who's in the shelter here we go back to the kuhu who else was in the shelter
02:07:20.40 --> 02:07:26.40 women and children sheltering more enemy soldiers with more pans or files than spandas
02:07:28.40 --> 02:07:32.80 we were in a vulnerable situation and it was no good pushing forward and ignoring the
02:07:32.80 --> 02:07:38.80 menace lurking inside that shelter i could have sent two or three men to clear it however
02:07:38.80 --> 02:07:45.20 experience a top me that when clearing sellers that the first man sent in is invariably killed
02:07:46.80 --> 02:07:52.000 instead concentrated fire was poured into the entrance included gapiat bomb
02:07:53.52 --> 02:07:59.04 around us the battle still raged and no opportunity to arose from the idea for me to inspect
02:07:59.04 --> 02:08:08.08 the consequences of an awful decision nevertheless my duty was to win battles and not to
02:08:08.08 --> 02:08:15.28 gamble with the lives of my soldiers by fussing over two sensitive conscience so there you go
02:08:15.28 --> 02:08:18.80 there's dichotomy for you at the one hand he's looking at this shelter thinking there might be
02:08:18.80 --> 02:08:22.56 women and kids in there but at this moment in time he doesn't have time to find out and doesn't have
02:08:22.56 --> 02:08:28.40 time to take of the most cautious route so they hammer it with machine gun fire and some
02:08:28.40 --> 02:08:35.52 anti-tank rounds he never even goes to look but he knows that he can't his duty is to win battles
02:08:36.64 --> 02:08:40.24 and he can't diddy dally because he has a sensitive conscience doesn't work
02:08:47.12 --> 02:08:54.40 back to the book Bremer Haven was our final objective it was fifth of May 1945
02:08:54.40 --> 02:09:00.96 19 days before my 21st birthday think about what you were doing you were doing
02:09:00.96 --> 02:09:09.52 and that's what it's just ready to break out we were concentrated at will-stet
02:09:09.52 --> 02:09:18.72 about 20 miles north of Bremen when the end came and by the end I mean the end of the war
02:09:18.72 --> 02:09:27.68 129 brigades order was stand down and spliced the rain brace which is a military it's actually
02:09:27.68 --> 02:09:34.16 a navy term spliced the main brace means like drinking light is lit you can drink the war's over
02:09:35.44 --> 02:09:39.52 I had just given orders for our small part in the brigades move forward against 15
02:09:39.52 --> 02:09:47.84 Panzer Division one of the famous Africa core formations in 1983 Jim Kingston gave me his copy
02:09:47.84 --> 02:09:50.32 of those orders which he had kept all those years
02:09:52.40 --> 02:09:58.96 reaction to the end of the war like aggression increased further behind the lines one went
02:10:00.24 --> 02:10:06.24 the natural aristocracy of the battlefield the infantry having fired a photo joy
02:10:06.24 --> 02:10:15.44 of very lights curled up and slept we had learned too much to indulge in shallow demonstrations
02:10:15.44 --> 02:10:20.16 so everyone's all fireworks and getting crazy these guys are like cool I'm going to sleep
02:10:22.24 --> 02:10:29.44 since July we had come a long way from the Normandy beach head the battalion had lost 47
02:10:29.44 --> 02:10:36.72 officers and 1,266 NCOs and private soldiers killed or wounded
02:10:36.72 --> 02:10:47.76 after July 31st 1944 no member of 18 platoon was put on a charge no one went absent or deserted
02:10:49.28 --> 02:10:55.76 of the original 36 NCOs and soldiers who had landed in Normandy only corpable cheeseman remained
02:10:55.76 --> 02:11:06.08 one man many came after them and lasted a few days weeks or months
02:11:07.92 --> 02:11:15.28 few I was able to thank adequately I doubt if any of them realized how much I personally owed 18
02:11:15.28 --> 02:11:27.68 platoon when I joined them on 31st July I was naive and gouge due to a narrow upbringing except for
02:11:27.68 --> 02:11:34.32 a passionate love of music my intellect and emotions were unstimulated my achievement at school had
02:11:34.32 --> 02:11:43.76 been a bismal my mind was undisciplined and confidence in myself nil this was rapidly swept away
02:11:43.76 --> 02:11:49.92 probably within three weeks certainly before we crossed the sin on the 28th of August
02:11:51.60 --> 02:11:57.12 discovering an ability to command a group of men some frightened and bewildered produced
02:11:57.12 --> 02:12:03.04 a new found confidence particularly since I seem to be able to achieve it quietly and without
02:12:03.04 --> 02:12:11.28 acrimony or fuss having to improvise tactics to overcome the shortcomings of battle school training
02:12:11.28 --> 02:12:17.44 also helped it proved to me that in some circumstances older and more experienced than I
02:12:18.24 --> 02:12:24.80 others older and more experienced than I could be wrong I suspect that as an only child I had been
02:12:24.80 --> 02:12:33.44 brought up in too much of my elders a new world had opened before me forethought and planning were
02:12:33.44 --> 02:12:44.08 demanded a imagination and instinct too was that apparently quiet normandy lane lethal the intense
02:12:44.08 --> 02:12:49.76 spanned outfire and ordering a long a diek was it a prelude to an enemies withdrawal did the
02:12:49.76 --> 02:12:56.24 orchard in front of the village hide 88s my judgment in these things had proved equal to better than
02:12:56.24 --> 02:13:05.60 most of than the most and it was the making of me it also brought a few problems I'm now only
02:13:05.60 --> 02:13:14.48 able to plan and run things in my way as a result I'm probably unemployable however I would never
02:13:14.48 --> 02:13:20.32 wish to change places with the shy hesitant boy whom circumstances put in command of 18ble tune
02:13:20.32 --> 02:13:27.36 age 20 I was far too young and inexperienced to appreciate that an infantry platoon was the finest
02:13:27.36 --> 02:13:33.76 command in the army and that's the success or failure of a battle so often lay solely in the hands
02:13:33.76 --> 02:13:42.32 of a young officer after careful reflection I doubt that at any time since the war have I
02:13:42.32 --> 02:13:53.28 carried the burden of responsibility that I bore as a subaltern in battle when an army corps division
02:13:53.28 --> 02:13:58.56 or brigade was committed to battle it was the battalion company in platoon commanders who took over
02:13:58.56 --> 02:14:06.24 the mantle of responsibility from the generals and brigadiers in close country for us and street
02:14:06.24 --> 02:14:13.68 fighting the platoon commander became the lynch pin only the company and platoon commanders particularly
02:14:13.68 --> 02:14:19.52 the latter were able to have close relationship with their soldiers which is a prerequisite
02:14:19.52 --> 02:14:27.04 for having above average success failure by one infantry company could record a divisional battle plan
02:14:27.04 --> 02:14:35.20 conversely gallant success like B company at Xan 10 underwrote the battalions victory
02:14:37.44 --> 02:14:43.68 again I would emphasize the analog with the bond of professional respect between a great conductor
02:14:43.68 --> 02:14:49.44 and the members of a symphony orchestra without which a truly great performance is not possible
02:14:49.44 --> 02:14:56.32 outstanding performances cannot be arranged in a concert promoters office the created by
02:14:56.32 --> 02:15:03.84 some magic by the conductor in players in rehearsal and performance similarly while senior commanders
02:15:03.84 --> 02:15:08.24 appreciated the strengths and weaknesses of their battions and brigades they could not extract
02:15:08.24 --> 02:15:16.16 a great performance from the riflemen upon whom victory depended only the company of platoon
02:15:16.16 --> 02:15:26.48 commanders supported by their NCOs could ensure that 42 years on I get considerable satisfaction
02:15:26.48 --> 02:15:30.32 from 18 platoon successes more so than I got at the time
02:15:30.32 --> 02:15:48.56 so those are his thoughts and he's the wars now over and a few days after the war ended
02:15:48.56 --> 02:15:59.04 well go to the book after cholera and noculations we were conducted into the world of Frankenstein
02:16:00.80 --> 02:16:07.52 nothing had prepared us for what we now experienced not hill one twelve not mount pinchon
02:16:07.52 --> 02:16:16.000 else or hoven could compete with this horror before the incredulous eyes of 18 platoon spread
02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.80 over acres of delightfully wooded countryside was a factory of death
02:16:23.36 --> 02:16:30.16 and they sheaded bodies resembling wax effigies of an alien race from a strange and distant planet
02:16:30.16 --> 02:16:38.24 filled many pits the stench of death and the sight of such highly industrialized
02:16:38.24 --> 02:16:49.92 human degradation left my soldiers speechless private macy d companies deep driver
02:16:49.92 --> 02:16:57.36 aptly summed it up there is now no doubt that we have fought a just war
02:16:57.36 --> 02:17:06.000 that's after they saw the concentration camps obviously
02:17:13.76 --> 02:17:18.96 back to the book within a month of the war ending 21st Army group was required to supply
02:17:18.96 --> 02:17:22.000 junior officers for the 14th Army in Burma
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:29.36 lipy the commanding officer decided that I should be one of them and by then being intent on a
02:17:29.36 --> 02:17:36.80 military career I was not inclined to argue I would gain useful experience of jungle warfare
02:17:37.60 --> 02:17:43.92 of which I knew nothing about so they're getting orders still a war going on in the
02:17:43.92 --> 02:17:48.16 Pacific oh you wrapped up pushing from normandy through germany through their surrender
02:17:48.16 --> 02:17:55.76 guess well we need we need people to go to fight in Asia we need people in Burma
02:17:57.28 --> 02:18:03.68 I was totally unprepared for the platoons for the emotions that were unleashed immediately
02:18:05.12 --> 02:18:14.80 after I was deprived of 18 platoon as a Jeep took me away from the battalion a gas-lead
02:18:14.80 --> 02:18:22.000 desolation and golf to me I felt like a small boy on his way to a grim and unknown boarding school
02:18:24.16 --> 02:18:28.56 the pleasures of commanding 18 platoon and peace time were being denied me
02:18:28.56 --> 02:18:44.000 and it's interesting so he gets pulled away from his platoon and he goes and talk about
02:18:45.52 --> 02:18:53.28 what happened to the guys that survived that he knew and I found this part to be fascinating in the
02:18:53.28 --> 02:19:03.04 how these people went back to normal life back to the book Jim Kingston was demobilized in
02:19:03.04 --> 02:19:09.36 January 1946 and two months later he returned to his civilian post with the Bristol
02:19:09.36 --> 02:19:17.20 Corporation Electricity Department retired in 1975 never married Doug Proctor returned home to
02:19:17.20 --> 02:19:23.76 his wife and baby son and not in Hammond March of 1946 found the transition from army to civilian
02:19:23.76 --> 02:19:27.52 life painless returning to his accounting post in the coal industry
02:19:31.44 --> 02:19:36.72 oh and cheeseman during the first few days of his demobilization is wife died
02:19:38.80 --> 02:19:44.96 miserable and forlorn he returned to his old job in Covent Garden and a few years later
02:19:44.96 --> 02:19:51.20 he met in married Bella who in his own words was a comfort and inspiration to him
02:19:53.60 --> 02:19:57.60 Charles Raven joined the London Transport as a bus conductor
02:19:59.12 --> 02:20:04.96 later transferring to the clerical staff and rose by hard work and study to be a garage inspector
02:20:04.96 --> 02:20:14.56 Joe Thomas and George Harris went into the building trade industry in Bridgewater
02:20:21.60 --> 02:20:31.44 surprisingly just incredibly normal paths after this incredibly not normal life and
02:20:31.44 --> 02:20:37.84 and what happened to Sydney Jerry so here's what happened to Sydney Jerry back to the book
02:20:37.84 --> 02:20:45.76 arriving in England on 9th July 1945 I reported to the holding battalion of the Hampshire
02:20:45.76 --> 02:20:54.000 Regiment at Westgate on sea and was immediately sent on 28 days leave after night out in London with
02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:02.24 three friends also berm a bound I telephone my parents and found them away
02:21:02.80 --> 02:21:09.76 caught a train from waterloo and went to see them staying at the same hotel as my parents were
02:21:10.64 --> 02:21:16.72 flight lieutenant Jack weatherlies widow Peggy and their three-year-old daughter Anne
02:21:17.52 --> 02:21:22.80 we're staying at the same hotel as his parents at once a bond of deep understanding and affection
02:21:22.80 --> 02:21:32.96 developed between us in August and Adam Baum was dropped and so at a stroke my visit to Burma was
02:21:32.96 --> 02:21:43.52 rendered pointless so two in my heart was a military career I soldiered on in Libya and Palestine
02:21:43.52 --> 02:21:49.84 with the first battalion of my own regiment for two more interesting years and finally was demobilized
02:21:49.84 --> 02:22:02.48 in May of 1947 within a week of leaving the army I attended a job interview the managing
02:22:02.48 --> 02:22:08.16 director who saw me a pale and thin-lipped man was a business acquaintance of a relative
02:22:09.92 --> 02:22:18.32 he eyed me coldly slowly and precisely from his desk he lifted a ruler which he rudely pointed
02:22:18.32 --> 02:22:26.32 at my face I understand that you made a slight name for yourself in the war be that as it may
02:22:26.32 --> 02:22:31.36 people like you Jerry should remember that while you have been galleventing around the world
02:22:31.36 --> 02:22:38.48 most of my staff had remained loyal to the company if you can give me one valid reason why
02:22:38.48 --> 02:22:49.28 should even consider you for any position I should be interested to hear it I nearly hit him now I
02:22:49.28 --> 02:22:54.48 wish that I had quickly grabbing my hat no umbrella I rose and told him that if he was the last
02:22:54.48 --> 02:23:02.08 man in the world I would rather starve than work for him with that I left my heart pounding
02:23:02.08 --> 02:23:07.04 and a foul taste in my mouth I walked aimlessly through miles of streets wishing that I was
02:23:07.04 --> 02:23:14.24 back on some battlefield with real men soldiers like 18 platoon
02:23:17.84 --> 02:23:25.76 armistice day brings its problems pagan I would like to go to church we used to go but found
02:23:25.76 --> 02:23:30.40 almost without exception a lack of perception and sensitivity amongst the clergy
02:23:30.40 --> 02:23:40.48 we suffered one armistice day sir sermon devoted to the curates theory that war being a crime
02:23:40.48 --> 02:23:49.36 against humanity all chivalry must therefore be hypocritical I wondered whether the German
02:23:49.36 --> 02:23:58.32 stretcher bears and their wounded at sin drn would have agreed I took offense pagan I have a lot
02:23:58.32 --> 02:24:08.24 to mourn she jack weatherly and I 18 pltunes dead perhaps it is expecting too much of anyone to
02:24:08.24 --> 02:24:16.24 understand intense grief particularly that of an now aging platoon commander who had to lead some of his
02:24:16.24 --> 02:24:29.76 men to their deaths we now spend armistice day quietly at home with our ghosts
02:24:34.08 --> 02:24:40.24 memories abound during the night I made a habit of wandering around the platoon
02:24:40.24 --> 02:24:47.92 position so that each of my soldiers could talk to me I learned a lot they talked about their families
02:24:47.92 --> 02:24:54.40 and their future hopes I hardly had to contribute to those whispered conversations that some
02:24:54.40 --> 02:24:58.64 times took place in the dead of night or in the cold gray light just before dawn
02:25:01.68 --> 02:25:04.32 I think it may have helped my soldiers to have a confidant
02:25:04.32 --> 02:25:11.44 invaluable experience of human nature I now treasure the memory
02:25:16.08 --> 02:25:23.20 weapons also left memories the monotonous repetitive bursts of the brain the hysterical
02:25:23.20 --> 02:25:30.64 shriek of the mg 42's for furious rate of fire and the lethal chatter of the stands and schmysers all
02:25:30.64 --> 02:25:40.56 contribute all contributed to the cacophony of battle traceable it seared themselves into memory
02:25:41.76 --> 02:25:52.000 fired from a distance the parable approached almost lazily until suddenly like a swarm of fiery
02:25:52.000 --> 02:26:00.000 demons they accelerated directly past one's head with earspooling cracks I shall never forget the
02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:06.80 brain splitting shockwave as mortar bombs detonated nor the rending of the atmosphere when a stick
02:26:06.80 --> 02:26:14.80 of nebel war for bombs straddled one slit trench my memory is stocked with smells
02:26:16.32 --> 02:26:21.76 the metallic stench of dead cattle and Normandy the punching odor of German prisoners and the
02:26:21.76 --> 02:26:32.48 vial penetrating chemical smell from a newly plowed shell creator strange fleeting memories too
02:26:34.72 --> 02:26:41.68 why in circumstance of great danger did the palms of my hands moisten making it difficult to grip the
02:26:41.68 --> 02:26:49.36 butt of my pistol why on pitch black knights full of menace was it possible to discern enemy
02:26:49.36 --> 02:26:55.28 movement by fixing my straining eyes slightly to its side it sounds foolish but I swear that it works
02:26:57.04 --> 02:27:02.48 after 40 years I am sure I could still prime a 36 grenade in total darkness or load the
02:27:02.48 --> 02:27:10.88 magazines of a cult automatic pistol I remember our dead
02:27:10.88 --> 02:27:19.52 their souls departing they lay awkwardly like bundles of discarded clothing
02:27:21.12 --> 02:27:25.52 at bedberg lands corporal portius lay by their railway crossing
02:27:27.44 --> 02:27:32.000 in an instant he had gone leaving his body clothing and equipment
02:27:33.52 --> 02:27:34.000 empty
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:43.60 at halvin boom private jones died with a tiny cry boston the chill winter air
02:27:44.48 --> 02:27:46.08 as the bullet took him from us
02:27:52.16 --> 02:27:53.76 memories are not all sad
02:27:55.92 --> 02:28:00.24 rarely since as my adrenaline flowed as an advance to combat
02:28:00.24 --> 02:28:08.24 with all the senses alert one lived for a few hours sometimes for day at a concert pitch
02:28:10.48 --> 02:28:18.72 like a drug it captivated me I wanted more totally absorbed one pressed on until objectives had been
02:28:18.72 --> 02:28:23.44 seized then I flopped as I had never done since
02:28:23.44 --> 02:28:31.60 I remember the mood of pulsating expectancy during the last few hours before battle
02:28:31.60 --> 02:28:37.12 old trusted friends like Dennis Clark and brandly handcock would arrive to tie up their artillery
02:28:37.12 --> 02:28:43.04 support others troop commanders from the Sherwood Rangers would appear almost in party mood
02:28:43.04 --> 02:28:49.44 demari up with us the very air was vibrant with excitement and good fellowship no
02:28:49.44 --> 02:28:56.32 acrimony simply an exercise and willing cooperation to help us the infantry over come the day's grim
02:28:56.32 --> 02:29:00.32 task
02:29:02.24 --> 02:29:10.48 but my most treasured memory is the simple and sincere affection which existed between us all
02:29:13.68 --> 02:29:17.92 based on mutual trust it was the cornerstone of the platoon success
02:29:17.92 --> 02:29:26.64 and it survives unchanged to this day this is changed with regret regret because
02:29:26.64 --> 02:29:31.60 Jim Kingston owned cheeseman and particularly Doug Proctor did not receive any
02:29:31.60 --> 02:29:33.92 recognition they so richly deserved
02:29:36.08 --> 02:29:40.72 Jim and Owen were mentioned dispatches but Doug was left unrewarded
02:29:42.88 --> 02:29:47.76 over the years this omission has troubled me particularly because I had not been
02:29:47.76 --> 02:29:54.000 so had I not been so young and inexperienced more notice might have been taken of my representations
02:29:55.84 --> 02:30:01.20 I have no doubt that they all learned a military metal on more than one occasion and I their
02:30:01.20 --> 02:30:04.48 platoon commander failed them in this respect
02:30:04.48 --> 02:30:16.56 I miss my soldiers the warmth of their presence comforted me and their humor restored my spirits
02:30:19.36 --> 02:30:26.32 in the brutal world of infantry warfare although few of them realized it and certainly none would admit it
02:30:26.32 --> 02:30:37.60 their behavior was noble their absence left avoid which but for an exceptionally happy marriage
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:45.20 would have certainly drawn me back into the army for the comfort that only a soldier can
02:30:45.20 --> 02:30:57.44 understand strangely I have never since considered myself anything but a soldier
02:30:57.44 --> 02:31:27.36 and that wraps up that book and I'm not sure if I have much
02:31:27.36 --> 02:31:29.36 to add because
02:31:37.44 --> 02:31:40.72 because Sidney Jerry seems to capture it
02:31:44.80 --> 02:31:46.80 and so much of what he talks about
02:31:49.44 --> 02:31:50.48 explains
02:31:50.48 --> 02:32:00.88 so much not only about about being a soldier but also about what it's like
02:32:02.56 --> 02:32:10.000 when a soldier is no longer a soldier to
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:19.60 to miss the adrenaline to miss that singular focus
02:32:19.60 --> 02:32:34.64 to miss seeing men at their best at their noblest
02:32:40.80 --> 02:32:43.76 to miss the men themselves
02:32:43.76 --> 02:32:52.88 your comrades your friends your brothers
02:32:54.96 --> 02:33:05.36 to miss what he calls so perfectly that simple and sincere affection that exists in a platoon
02:33:05.36 --> 02:33:16.000 in affection that I'm not sure exists anywhere else
02:33:19.12 --> 02:33:22.88 and you you hear me talk about when I start talking about a seal platoon
02:33:25.76 --> 02:33:29.68 about how that's the best thing in the world and Sidney Jerry captures it
02:33:29.68 --> 02:33:38.32 better than me you miss the mission and you miss the men
02:33:40.88 --> 02:33:47.04 and of course you miss the fallen
02:33:47.04 --> 02:33:55.52 as the British call them the glorious dead
02:34:02.48 --> 02:34:07.12 and you wonder what would have become of them
02:34:07.12 --> 02:34:14.48 where would they be now
02:34:20.48 --> 02:34:22.88 and you you wonder why
02:34:27.04 --> 02:34:27.60 why them
02:34:27.60 --> 02:34:33.76 why was it them
02:34:40.40 --> 02:34:42.16 and you know I talk about
02:34:45.36 --> 02:34:49.28 the gift right the gift that they gave us
02:34:49.28 --> 02:34:57.84 that the fallen have given us this gift of freedom and this gift of life but there's
02:34:58.88 --> 02:35:04.24 there's more
02:35:04.24 --> 02:35:08.32 there's more
02:35:08.96 --> 02:35:11.28 because you see
02:35:13.76 --> 02:35:16.96 the rest of us
02:35:16.96 --> 02:35:18.96 we grow old
02:35:23.60 --> 02:35:26.000 from time passes us by
02:35:31.04 --> 02:35:36.40 and that that simple and sincere affection that Sidney Jerry describes
02:35:39.76 --> 02:35:40.48 it changes
02:35:40.48 --> 02:35:46.48 as we change
02:35:47.92 --> 02:35:49.92 it ages
02:35:52.72 --> 02:35:54.72 as we age
02:35:58.24 --> 02:36:02.56 but the fallen do not change
02:36:04.72 --> 02:36:10.000 the fallen do not age time has no effect on them
02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000 they remain
02:36:15.44 --> 02:36:22.24 they remain young and bold and brave and uncomfortable
02:36:30.32 --> 02:36:32.80 and so we remember them
02:36:34.32 --> 02:36:34.80 that way
02:36:34.80 --> 02:36:41.52 as they were and as they will always be
02:36:49.28 --> 02:36:51.28 are heroes
02:36:55.84 --> 02:37:00.88 heroes who walk no more and yet walk everywhere with us
02:37:00.88 --> 02:37:07.92 who smile no more and yet they never stop smiling
02:37:12.16 --> 02:37:16.56 heroes who live no more yet never stop living
02:37:16.56 --> 02:37:35.92 are friends who shine no more and yet never stop shining
02:37:35.92 --> 02:37:47.60 and that is the other gift that they give us
02:37:54.32 --> 02:37:56.32 the fortune
02:37:56.32 --> 02:38:06.16 to panic
02:38:08.48 --> 02:38:12.80 and remember
02:38:12.80 --> 02:38:28.08 I think that's all I've got for tonight.
02:38:28.08 --> 02:38:56.40 So echo, maybe if you could talk about something else for a little while.
02:38:56.40 --> 02:39:00.000 Yeah, I would appreciate it.
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:10.20 A part that stood out and we talked about this before, where the Germans were attacking
02:39:10.20 --> 02:39:12.92 150 yards away.
02:39:12.92 --> 02:39:16.36 They just get mowed down, they just keep killed.
02:39:16.36 --> 02:39:19.84 The red flag comes up.
02:39:19.84 --> 02:39:21.48 Structures come out.
02:39:21.48 --> 02:39:26.08 Everyone sees fires, they're following the specific rules.
02:39:26.08 --> 02:39:30.72 And then they collect the bodies and they salute.
02:39:30.72 --> 02:39:34.64 We're good and then he salutes back.
02:39:34.64 --> 02:39:35.64 Okay, solid.
02:39:35.64 --> 02:39:40.08 No, game on, essentially game on now.
02:39:40.08 --> 02:39:41.64 But this is like a war, though.
02:39:41.64 --> 02:39:42.64 You know, it's different.
02:39:42.64 --> 02:39:45.56 I mean, you kind of get that same feeling way on the lower level.
02:39:45.56 --> 02:39:49.84 Obviously, but you're watching a UFC fight and then the round ends.
02:39:49.84 --> 02:39:52.44 And then the guys kind of bump, bump, bump, like good round.
02:39:52.44 --> 02:39:53.44 For sure.
02:39:53.44 --> 02:39:58.000 So, well, two seconds ago, you guys were trying to knock the guy out, you know, just
02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:59.44 like in this situation.
02:39:59.44 --> 02:40:03.24 Two seconds ago, these guys were coming to kill you and you killed them, killed them.
02:40:03.24 --> 02:40:04.24 Yeah.
02:40:04.24 --> 02:40:12.28 Boom, it happened round over, you know, let's essentially continue following the rules.
02:40:12.28 --> 02:40:16.56 And it's weird because it's less about the rules and more about like the respect, you
02:40:16.56 --> 02:40:17.56 know?
02:40:17.56 --> 02:40:18.56 It is.
02:40:18.56 --> 02:40:23.36 And on top of that, you can pile on the fact that when they were in a hole in
02:40:23.36 --> 02:40:29.96 woods, the Germans had booby trapped the British body, so they were just laying there.
02:40:29.96 --> 02:40:33.72 They didn't get the same respect back.
02:40:33.72 --> 02:40:39.08 But I think that's one thing that Sydney Jerry is very intent on throughout the book
02:40:39.08 --> 02:40:48.12 is that regardless of how depraved the enemy acts, they are going to take the high road.
02:40:48.12 --> 02:40:52.32 And you know, I think that's why this book is, this book, they give this book to everyone
02:40:52.32 --> 02:40:57.16 at Sanhurst, which is the British military academy.
02:40:57.16 --> 02:40:58.16 They give us everyone.
02:40:58.16 --> 02:41:03.96 I mean, that's a great reason why because he sets a standard with his troops and they hold
02:41:03.96 --> 02:41:08.40 that standard through regardless of the way the enemy behaves.
02:41:08.40 --> 02:41:11.08 They don't lower themselves to that behavior.
02:41:11.08 --> 02:41:16.12 You know, the worst atrocity that gets committed by his soldiers is when they spank
02:41:16.12 --> 02:41:18.56 a waffen SS guy on the ass.
02:41:18.56 --> 02:41:19.56 Yeah.
02:41:19.56 --> 02:41:24.04 That's why this book is so powerful.
02:41:24.04 --> 02:41:28.68 And you know, there's a lot of the book is very, it's very, you know, there's stuff
02:41:28.68 --> 02:41:34.28 in there that you just aren't ready for, right?
02:41:34.28 --> 02:41:37.88 Even when he was talking about the traits that someone should have.
02:41:37.88 --> 02:41:43.16 And you know, when you start thinking about it, he's right.
02:41:43.16 --> 02:41:44.16 He's right.
02:41:44.16 --> 02:41:48.84 And if you had the choice between getting some meat head that was going to go do your
02:41:48.84 --> 02:41:50.92 bidding, even though he might look like a big beast.
02:41:50.92 --> 02:41:53.92 And he's going to, but then if you think about how's that guy going to act?
02:41:53.92 --> 02:41:58.12 When things get tough or when things become ethically challenging.
02:41:58.12 --> 02:41:59.12 Yeah.
02:41:59.12 --> 02:42:00.72 How's that person going to act?
02:42:00.72 --> 02:42:09.04 So these are, and it's, and I love the fact also that man, he's killing people.
02:42:09.04 --> 02:42:13.72 He's lead, you know, it's easy to get caught up in the fact that he's wearing Corbura
02:42:13.72 --> 02:42:14.92 Pants and he's got this.
02:42:14.92 --> 02:42:15.92 There's a part, there's another part.
02:42:15.92 --> 02:42:26.80 And didn't go over in the podcast, but there's a group of German, there's like German, some
02:42:26.80 --> 02:42:30.24 kind of artillery piece and an artillery team.
02:42:30.24 --> 02:42:34.84 And they're getting, the, the brits are getting their guns dialed in to the team.
02:42:34.84 --> 02:42:36.60 And they're going to start killing them.
02:42:36.60 --> 02:42:38.80 And they make a run for it.
02:42:38.80 --> 02:42:39.80 And they have horses.
02:42:39.80 --> 02:42:44.88 And there's like six guys and some horses towing this, this artillery piece away.
02:42:44.88 --> 02:42:47.32 And the city Jerry feels happy.
02:42:47.32 --> 02:42:50.48 He's happy that the, he's especially happy the horses, like, you know, he doesn't like
02:42:50.48 --> 02:42:54.96 seeing the, the, the animals get killed.
02:42:54.96 --> 02:42:58.68 And so he's actually happy that these guys escape.
02:42:58.68 --> 02:43:02.24 And then he just says, you know, well, that's wrong because these guys have been come back
02:43:02.24 --> 02:43:04.36 and killed my soldiers.
02:43:04.36 --> 02:43:13.44 So he does a, you can see how hard it is for someone to be in these situations where
02:43:13.44 --> 02:43:16.52 you have the good conscience, which wants to do the right thing.
02:43:16.52 --> 02:43:19.36 And at the same time, you got to kill people.
02:43:19.36 --> 02:43:20.56 Yeah.
02:43:20.56 --> 02:43:23.52 And that's what makes combat so hard.
02:43:23.52 --> 02:43:24.52 Yeah.
02:43:24.52 --> 02:43:29.52 And he didn't, can he get to thinking about, remember the Christmas, the Christmas.
02:43:29.52 --> 02:43:30.52 Christmas.
02:43:30.52 --> 02:43:31.52 Yeah.
02:43:31.52 --> 02:43:32.52 Yeah.
02:43:32.52 --> 02:43:33.52 Yeah.
02:43:33.52 --> 02:43:34.52 Christmas.
02:43:34.52 --> 02:43:35.52 Yeah.
02:43:35.52 --> 02:43:37.52 Where the Germans, the Germans kind of in that situation, they initiated that, right?
02:43:37.52 --> 02:43:40.000 They were, like, cause like a mutual initiation.
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.92 But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you remember that particular story, but I think overall it
02:43:43.92 --> 02:43:47.20 was almost like a mutual initiation, but yes, in that particular story, there was sort of a
02:43:47.20 --> 02:43:48.56 voice that says, hey, yeah, okay.
02:43:48.56 --> 02:43:50.52 I don't cheat you, whatever.
02:43:50.52 --> 02:43:57.000 And yeah, man, it's just crazy how that can kind of emerge from these situations where
02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:01.04 guys are just straight up getting blown to pieces on purpose, by the way.
02:44:01.04 --> 02:44:03.08 Not, you know, not like some tragic accident.
02:44:03.08 --> 02:44:04.56 Like, this is that's the intent.
02:44:04.56 --> 02:44:06.92 That's the intention.
02:44:06.92 --> 02:44:11.36 And then they want to just stop and sing together, please soccer.
02:44:11.36 --> 02:44:15.000 And then the next day, by the way, they're going back to killing each other on mass.
02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.000 Yeah.
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.000 Dang.
02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:23.56 Yeah, that's the thing about, you know, the, you know, this, a book like this is so
02:44:23.56 --> 02:44:28.56 revealing of human nature, because business people have to do the same thing.
02:44:28.56 --> 02:44:29.56 Yeah.
02:44:29.56 --> 02:44:34.68 You know, if you're a business person and your business is losing money, well, guess what
02:44:34.68 --> 02:44:36.60 you might have to do, cut staff.
02:44:36.60 --> 02:44:40.68 So if you got to, and you, you know, we, let's say we're working with a small business
02:44:40.68 --> 02:44:42.40 or you're, you've got a small business.
02:44:42.40 --> 02:44:43.40 You've got 20 people.
02:44:43.40 --> 02:44:44.88 You know all those 20 people.
02:44:44.88 --> 02:44:45.88 Yeah.
02:44:45.88 --> 02:44:48.68 But it's not like a nameless person that you're firing.
02:44:48.68 --> 02:44:53.52 When you let go for five people, because you need to save money next quarter, you're
02:44:53.52 --> 02:44:54.92 going to lose your building.
02:44:54.92 --> 02:44:55.92 Yeah.
02:44:55.92 --> 02:44:56.92 Guess what?
02:44:56.92 --> 02:44:57.92 You're going to know those people.
02:44:57.92 --> 02:44:58.92 Yeah.
02:44:58.92 --> 02:45:04.52 And so it's the same dichotomy where this boss who wants to take care of his people, just
02:45:04.52 --> 02:45:08.48 like Sydney Jerry wants to take care of his men and all of a sudden the only way to do
02:45:08.48 --> 02:45:11.72 your mission is you've got to, you've got to get some of these people killed, or you're
02:45:11.72 --> 02:45:13.04 going to fire some of these people.
02:45:13.04 --> 02:45:14.48 Otherwise our plant shuts down.
02:45:14.48 --> 02:45:17.12 Otherwise we can't go forward and everyone dies.
02:45:17.12 --> 02:45:18.68 No one has a job now.
02:45:18.68 --> 02:45:25.68 So the similarities, again, that's why it's, that's why these things about war reveal so much
02:45:25.68 --> 02:45:30.28 about human nature, which is really what this podcast is about, is about human nature.
02:45:30.28 --> 02:45:33.16 And the better you understand human nature, there's two things that can happen.
02:45:33.16 --> 02:45:38.44 Number one, the better you can lead other people, but equally as important, if not more
02:45:38.44 --> 02:45:42.68 important, is if you understand human nature, you can understand yourself.
02:45:42.68 --> 02:45:43.68 Yeah.
02:45:43.68 --> 02:45:44.92 You can understand the decisions that you make.
02:45:44.92 --> 02:45:46.84 You can understand why something's bothering you.
02:45:46.84 --> 02:45:54.000 You can understand what you need to conclude so that you can move forward in the best possible
02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:55.000 way.
02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:59.12 And if you don't understand human nature, you're, you're, in that, that's understanding
02:45:59.12 --> 02:46:00.12 yourself.
02:46:00.12 --> 02:46:01.12 Yeah.
02:46:01.12 --> 02:46:05.20 And these books allow you to gather and garner so much of that.
02:46:05.20 --> 02:46:06.20 Yeah.
02:46:06.20 --> 02:46:07.20 Yeah.
02:46:07.20 --> 02:46:08.20 Especially all the similarities.
02:46:08.20 --> 02:46:09.20 So many.
02:46:09.20 --> 02:46:11.20 All the time.
02:46:11.20 --> 02:46:15.84 I remember in, just not junior high.
02:46:15.84 --> 02:46:17.64 Yeah, I was junior high.
02:46:17.64 --> 02:46:19.84 Um, maybe early high school.
02:46:19.84 --> 02:46:25.000 So when I used to play pop Warner football, where my best friend played for a different
02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:26.000 team.
02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.04 But we're all, you know, it's in pop Warner.
02:46:28.04 --> 02:46:32.08 It's different.
02:46:32.08 --> 02:46:33.08 It's not by school.
02:46:33.08 --> 02:46:36.08 It's by like, Regent, you know, like, an up region.
02:46:36.08 --> 02:46:37.08 I guess town.
02:46:37.08 --> 02:46:38.08 I'm going to go in.
02:46:38.08 --> 02:46:39.08 I don't think.
02:46:39.08 --> 02:46:41.92 Anyway, so the, you know, my best friend at the time, his name was Byron.
02:46:41.92 --> 02:46:44.68 He, uh, who became a pilot, by the way.
02:46:44.68 --> 02:46:45.68 I think it's the arms.
02:46:45.68 --> 02:46:46.68 Yeah, I'm here.
02:46:46.68 --> 02:46:47.68 I'm here.
02:46:47.68 --> 02:46:48.68 I'm here.
02:46:48.68 --> 02:46:49.68 I'm here.
02:46:49.68 --> 02:46:51.80 Anyway, um, he played for a different team, but we were best friends.
02:46:51.80 --> 02:46:55.08 So it was kind of that thing, you know, where your friends with the guys, but then,
02:46:55.08 --> 02:46:58.000 you know, you go on the battlefield, you gather battling, you're back to friends.
02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.36 Yeah, you're not killing them, though.
02:47:00.36 --> 02:47:01.64 No way, different.
02:47:01.64 --> 02:47:07.000 Yeah, uh, and there's, did you ever see that in Iraq, like, any of that, like, I don't
02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.04 know, compassion, you know, yeah.
02:47:09.04 --> 02:47:10.04 Yeah, for sure.
02:47:10.04 --> 02:47:11.04 Even with the enemy type.
02:47:11.04 --> 02:47:12.84 We're not not so much with the enemy type.
02:47:12.84 --> 02:47:13.84 That's what I mean.
02:47:13.84 --> 02:47:16.24 But with the civilian types, for sure.
02:47:16.24 --> 02:47:21.56 I mean, I mean, obviously, and you'd see guys would go completely out of the way to try
02:47:21.56 --> 02:47:23.80 and protect the civilian.
02:47:23.80 --> 02:47:26.32 The enemy over there is a lot.
02:47:26.32 --> 02:47:27.32 It's different.
02:47:27.32 --> 02:47:32.24 Yeah, there's a, there's a, there's, you know, here you have a uniformed soldier.
02:47:32.24 --> 02:47:33.24 Yeah.
02:47:33.24 --> 02:47:34.80 You know, there you don't have a uniformed soldier.
02:47:34.80 --> 02:47:39.24 You got somebody that's trying to sneak around and, and bully up the 90.
02:47:39.24 --> 02:47:44.12 And yeah, you don't see that same level of now.
02:47:44.12 --> 02:47:48.20 Uh, I mean, once you get a guy captured, that's it.
02:47:48.20 --> 02:47:49.20 You know, okay.
02:47:49.20 --> 02:47:50.20 We got him captured.
02:47:50.20 --> 02:47:51.40 Zip them up, put him in the back of the home V.
02:47:51.40 --> 02:47:53.40 I mean, that's it.
02:47:53.40 --> 02:47:54.40 Yeah.
02:47:54.40 --> 02:48:03.56 So you definitely, what what he talks about is this mutual respect of like look, we're
02:48:03.56 --> 02:48:06.28 sitting in a slit trench getting murdered.
02:48:06.28 --> 02:48:10.12 And when I, like when I meet you, you're on the other side, but I know that you've been
02:48:10.12 --> 02:48:12.80 slitting him that sitting in a slit trench getting murdered all day.
02:48:12.80 --> 02:48:13.80 Right.
02:48:13.80 --> 02:48:15.60 That's why we have mutual respect for each other.
02:48:15.60 --> 02:48:16.60 Yeah.
02:48:16.60 --> 02:48:18.76 In Iraq, it's asymmetrical warfare.
02:48:18.76 --> 02:48:23.36 So they're not suffering the same type of situation.
02:48:23.36 --> 02:48:28.64 And they also, you know, one thing that really throws that stuff out the window is the
02:48:28.64 --> 02:48:31.52 way that the insurgents treated the civilian populace.
02:48:31.52 --> 02:48:32.52 Yeah.
02:48:32.52 --> 02:48:40.16 So we're witnessing nonjudicial murders like when executions, we're seeing that.
02:48:40.16 --> 02:48:42.48 We're seeing civilians getting tortured.
02:48:42.48 --> 02:48:46.72 We're seeing, you know, people being beheaded.
02:48:46.72 --> 02:48:49.40 And so when you see that, you're there trying to help these people.
02:48:49.40 --> 02:48:56.16 And you start to think, look, if you're another infantryman in an opposing army, I can
02:48:56.16 --> 02:48:57.80 I can empathize with you.
02:48:57.80 --> 02:48:59.84 I can understand what you're going through.
02:48:59.84 --> 02:49:06.12 But if you're, even if you're another army, but I see you raping torturing, murdering,
02:49:06.12 --> 02:49:09.24 burning people alive, I don't empathize with you anymore.
02:49:09.24 --> 02:49:11.16 It doesn't work that way.
02:49:11.16 --> 02:49:13.36 So not really.
02:49:13.36 --> 02:49:14.36 Yeah.
02:49:14.36 --> 02:49:19.76 Now, you would get occasionally you'd get, like you could tell that someone would be mixed
02:49:19.76 --> 02:49:22.04 up in something that they shouldn't have been mixed up in.
02:49:22.04 --> 02:49:27.44 And maybe a young kid, you know, maybe a 17, 18 year old, because some of those kids,
02:49:27.44 --> 02:49:36.000 some of the insurgents were not vehemently, you know, pro al-Qaeda.
02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.92 Some of them were just, hey, look, I'm going to get paid 50 bucks to put an ID in the
02:49:39.92 --> 02:49:40.92 road.
02:49:40.92 --> 02:49:46.68 Yeah. And if you paid me 50 bucks to go and plant, you know, crop over there, I just
02:49:46.68 --> 02:49:47.68 assumed to do that.
02:49:47.68 --> 02:49:48.68 Yeah.
02:49:48.68 --> 02:49:49.68 So you'd see some of that.
02:49:49.68 --> 02:49:53.16 There'd be, okay, look, this kid's just, you know, he'd just caught up in something
02:49:53.16 --> 02:49:54.16 doesn't understand.
02:49:54.16 --> 02:49:59.56 And then again, I mean, all, again, the dichotomy is if you're putting an ID in the
02:49:59.56 --> 02:50:01.80 road to kill Americans, but I don't care about you.
02:50:01.80 --> 02:50:05.40 And I want to kill you.
02:50:05.40 --> 02:50:06.68 That's all there is to that.
02:50:06.68 --> 02:50:13.68 And, but it's definitely a different scenario when the people that you're fighting are,
02:50:13.68 --> 02:50:17.24 are the ones that are committing these kinds of atrocities.
02:50:17.24 --> 02:50:21.24 Because even as these guys, you know, they, you see how he differentiated between, like,
02:50:21.24 --> 02:50:26.92 the Waffen SS and like a normal infantry group, he differentiates those two.
02:50:26.92 --> 02:50:31.88 That'd be like if, let's say, the war in Iraq was against, let's say, Al Qaeda had taken
02:50:31.88 --> 02:50:37.08 over Iraq and you were fighting, given the hardened al Qaeda guys or some normal infantry
02:50:37.08 --> 02:50:38.08 men from the Iraqi army.
02:50:38.08 --> 02:50:43.32 Yeah, those guys, you'd been like, hey, look, this dude's surrender to, okay, the al Qaeda
02:50:43.32 --> 02:50:46.28 guys, first of all, they're probably not going to surrender.
02:50:46.28 --> 02:50:51.52 And if they do, that's, they're going to not get the same treatment that a guy that's
02:50:51.52 --> 02:50:53.84 a victim of circumstance, right?
02:50:53.84 --> 02:50:56.92 A lot of the Germans, they're victim of circumstance.
02:50:56.92 --> 02:50:59.12 Hey, that, this guy came into power.
02:50:59.12 --> 02:51:00.12 I was a soldier.
02:51:00.12 --> 02:51:01.12 I'm still a soldier.
02:51:01.12 --> 02:51:07.04 You know, and, man, it's heavy.
02:51:07.04 --> 02:51:08.68 It is.
02:51:08.68 --> 02:51:16.08 But there is definitely a mutual respect that you have for another servicemen that's, you
02:51:16.08 --> 02:51:18.88 know, has been through the same kind of crap that you've been through.
02:51:18.88 --> 02:51:19.88 Yeah.
02:51:19.88 --> 02:51:22.20 Yeah, man, make sense.
02:51:22.20 --> 02:51:26.96 So with that, speaking of heavy, lifting kettlebells.
02:51:26.96 --> 02:51:32.84 Anyway, I feel like we should talk about on it on a great kettlebells.
02:51:32.84 --> 02:51:36.92 Again, I do feel spoiled, even every time I pick a month, even though they're dope, you
02:51:36.92 --> 02:51:41.20 know, the artistic ones, should we call them artistic?
02:51:41.20 --> 02:51:42.20 No.
02:51:42.20 --> 02:51:43.20 Because they have names, right?
02:51:43.20 --> 02:51:44.20 Primal bells.
02:51:44.20 --> 02:51:46.92 Yeah, just called that better than or legend bells.
02:51:46.92 --> 02:51:51.80 All that stuff, you know, I feel kind of spoiled because they're kind of like the designer
02:51:51.80 --> 02:51:52.80 ones.
02:51:52.80 --> 02:51:55.28 They're designer-ish, balanced by the way.
02:51:55.28 --> 02:51:59.84 You know, we got into that.
02:51:59.84 --> 02:52:05.000 Here's the thing about the guy, and I said this before, starting light with kettlebells.
02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:06.56 It's critical.
02:52:06.56 --> 02:52:07.56 My friend Anthony came over.
02:52:07.56 --> 02:52:09.56 I don't know if you remember Anthony.
02:52:09.56 --> 02:52:10.56 No.
02:52:10.56 --> 02:52:13.60 The first day we recorded he was at my house.
02:52:13.60 --> 02:52:14.60 Oh, yeah.
02:52:14.60 --> 02:52:15.60 Yeah.
02:52:15.60 --> 02:52:18.68 So he came over the other day and he was like, yeah, let's lift and, you know, last
02:52:18.68 --> 02:52:20.72 time I seen him, I wasn't so much into the kettlebells.
02:52:20.72 --> 02:52:22.44 So I was like, all right, we're doing this thing.
02:52:22.44 --> 02:52:23.44 Be careful.
02:52:23.44 --> 02:52:24.44 And I saw him.
02:52:24.44 --> 02:52:25.44 He never done it.
02:52:25.44 --> 02:52:26.44 Did you hurt him?
02:52:26.44 --> 02:52:27.44 No, but-
02:52:27.44 --> 02:52:31.20 Oh, he just he grabbed the lightest one and, you know, I said, start light or whatever.
02:52:31.20 --> 02:52:35.76 And you could tell his, I'm gonna say this with all due respect if you haven't done
02:52:35.76 --> 02:52:37.24 it before.
02:52:37.24 --> 02:52:38.24 It makes sense.
02:52:38.24 --> 02:52:41.000 But like his form was way off and I'm thinking bro, you're gonna get hurt.
02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:42.000 Yeah.
02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:43.000 You know?
02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:44.000 Yeah.
02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:47.60 So I was gonna go into like what crazy workout I did, but I'll save that for another
02:52:47.60 --> 02:52:48.60 time.
02:52:48.60 --> 02:52:49.60 For now.
02:52:49.60 --> 02:52:50.60 We're almost at three hours right now.
02:52:50.60 --> 02:52:51.60 For now.
02:52:51.60 --> 02:52:52.60 I just looked at my watch.
02:52:52.60 --> 02:52:53.60 253.
02:52:53.60 --> 02:52:56.000 That's not a good sign.
02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.04 So I apologize to everyone in the world for doing a three and a half hour podcast,
02:53:00.04 --> 02:53:03.60 which is gonna turn into a faculty who describes his last 14 workouts.
02:53:03.60 --> 02:53:05.60 Four and a half hours.
02:53:05.60 --> 02:53:06.60 Great detail.
02:53:06.60 --> 02:53:10.44 Nonetheless, so we'll, uh, create a real quick.
02:53:10.44 --> 02:53:13.04 I was talking to somebody at the mustard.
02:53:13.04 --> 02:53:15.60 I think he was, I forget who it was.
02:53:15.60 --> 02:53:17.92 Nonetheless, we was talking about the benefits yet again.
02:53:17.92 --> 02:53:19.32 This is like a common thing.
02:53:19.32 --> 02:53:20.32 It's true.
02:53:20.32 --> 02:53:22.52 I don't exaggerate about the cruel oil.
02:53:22.52 --> 02:53:25.28 It's something like I can't go back to not taking cruel oil.
02:53:25.28 --> 02:53:26.28 No, take the cruel oil.
02:53:26.28 --> 02:53:27.28 And I don't mind.
02:53:27.28 --> 02:53:29.72 Oh, actually, we were talking to the left.
02:53:29.72 --> 02:53:31.84 Remember the life city you ran out of cruel oil?
02:53:31.84 --> 02:53:33.88 Yeah, and he's all mad at me because he gave me some.
02:53:33.88 --> 02:53:35.04 Oh, you're kidding.
02:53:35.04 --> 02:53:36.04 I didn't bring any.
02:53:36.04 --> 02:53:39.88 Yeah, actually technically technically was a channel that he brought me some.
02:53:39.88 --> 02:53:40.88 I think he just gave you one.
02:53:40.88 --> 02:53:41.88 None the less.
02:53:41.88 --> 02:53:42.88 He gave me one.
02:53:42.88 --> 02:53:45.000 Yeah, so I guess he can have a part of it.
02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:45.84 Got the credit.
02:53:45.84 --> 02:53:46.68 Nope.
02:53:46.68 --> 02:53:49.000 Nonetheless, I'll never go back to no cruel oil.
02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:50.32 So where would you get it?
02:53:50.32 --> 02:53:51.84 On it, cruel oil.
02:53:51.84 --> 02:53:53.84 What if you wanted to save money?
02:53:53.84 --> 02:53:55.88 Go on it.com slash chocolate.
02:53:55.88 --> 02:53:57.64 There's a lot of things on there.
02:53:57.64 --> 02:54:03.80 And on it is one of those good companies slash website where anything you need, like
02:54:03.80 --> 02:54:08.76 anything you need supplementation with, all the way down to workouts.
02:54:08.76 --> 02:54:10.68 They got it on there.
02:54:10.68 --> 02:54:14.08 Try your best not to get too addicted to the website because it's very fast.
02:54:14.08 --> 02:54:15.08 Very really funny.
02:54:15.08 --> 02:54:16.08 First, and that has that issue.
02:54:16.08 --> 02:54:17.08 I don't think so.
02:54:17.08 --> 02:54:21.80 I will guarantee you all spend time watching the videos and stuff.
02:54:21.80 --> 02:54:24.92 Browsing the products.
02:54:24.92 --> 02:54:28.72 Sometimes you can get like, we talked about the, you know, how you get on Amazon.
02:54:28.72 --> 02:54:30.64 And you're like, yeah, I want to get that thing too.
02:54:30.64 --> 02:54:31.80 You don't really need it.
02:54:31.80 --> 02:54:32.80 Just look super cool.
02:54:32.80 --> 02:54:33.80 It's one of those.
02:54:33.80 --> 02:54:34.80 Amazon does that.
02:54:34.80 --> 02:54:36.28 Yeah, so be careful.
02:54:36.28 --> 02:54:37.28 It does.
02:54:37.28 --> 02:54:38.64 But I don't think it like prompts you.
02:54:38.64 --> 02:54:40.64 It's just the list of stuff is all cool.
02:54:40.64 --> 02:54:42.28 You know, it's not just a kettlebell.
02:54:42.28 --> 02:54:43.80 It's the really cool one.
02:54:43.80 --> 02:54:45.80 You know, so it's that situation.
02:54:45.80 --> 02:54:49.56 Anyway, on it.com slash chocolate, if you want the 10% off.
02:54:49.56 --> 02:54:51.24 And yeah, report back.
02:54:51.24 --> 02:54:52.76 I mean, what you think?
02:54:52.76 --> 02:54:55.20 And if you ask me about the krill oil, right, I'll tell you.

02:55:00.68 --> 02:55:02.40 If I have anything to say about it.
02:55:02.40 --> 02:55:07.08 Another way to support is when you pick up your copy of 18
02:55:07.08 --> 02:55:13.16 platoon or whichever books you choose that chocolate reads on this podcast.
02:55:13.16 --> 02:55:17.000 Go on our website, jocabodcast.com, go to the book section on the top of this book
02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:18.68 from episodes.
02:55:18.68 --> 02:55:20.20 Click through there.
02:55:20.20 --> 02:55:21.20 It's up.
02:55:21.20 --> 02:55:26.000 If you're looking to get 18 platoon the book, you actually, you can get it on Amazon.
02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:29.44 Used for like 40 bucks.
02:55:29.44 --> 02:55:30.44 Used copy.
02:55:30.44 --> 02:55:33.24 Which they'll all be gone by the time.
02:55:33.24 --> 02:55:39.16 Whoever you are listening to this, you can also get it from a website.
02:55:39.16 --> 02:55:44.56 Riflesdirect.com, which actually supports the rifles regimen in the UK.
02:55:44.56 --> 02:55:47.96 So you can get it there as well.
02:55:47.96 --> 02:55:54.44 Or you can buy the used hardcover copies from Amazon.com after you click through.
02:55:54.44 --> 02:55:56.80 Yeah, click through there, boom.
02:55:56.80 --> 02:56:01.68 And even if you're buying something else, hey, click through.
02:56:01.68 --> 02:56:03.72 Support the cause anyway.
02:56:03.72 --> 02:56:05.72 Another way.
02:56:05.72 --> 02:56:13.08 Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, and any other podcast providing
02:56:13.08 --> 02:56:19.08 platforms also and not excluding YouTube.
02:56:19.08 --> 02:56:20.32 YouTube's a good one.
02:56:20.32 --> 02:56:21.32 Video version.
02:56:21.32 --> 02:56:23.04 I got YouTube read by the way.
02:56:23.04 --> 02:56:24.72 Okay, wait, wait, what's the benefit?
02:56:24.72 --> 02:56:29.48 So the one of the benefits is on YouTube, Brad, you can listen to, even if you go to another
02:56:29.48 --> 02:56:30.48 app, all right, yeah.
02:56:30.48 --> 02:56:31.48 Right, yeah.
02:56:31.48 --> 02:56:34.56 So it's a real, it's a real cool deal for me.
02:56:34.56 --> 02:56:35.56 Yeah, I'm in.
02:56:35.56 --> 02:56:37.56 It's real hands.
02:56:37.56 --> 02:56:38.56 I like that.
02:56:38.56 --> 02:56:39.56 Yeah, I know you do.
02:56:39.56 --> 02:56:40.56 Good.
02:56:40.56 --> 02:56:41.56 relevant.
02:56:41.56 --> 02:56:42.56 Most of the time.
02:56:42.56 --> 02:56:45.76 It's the same ad over and over and over and it gets, you know what, though, you
02:56:45.76 --> 02:56:47.32 know when they play, you ever see the same.
02:56:47.32 --> 02:56:48.88 Well, you don't see ads anymore.
02:56:48.88 --> 02:56:54.32 No, but there's a lot of people who may or may not enjoy ads and or still have the only
02:56:54.32 --> 02:56:55.32 person that enjoy ads.
02:56:55.32 --> 02:56:56.32 You got this.
02:56:56.32 --> 02:56:57.32 You got this.
02:56:57.32 --> 02:57:01.48 You know, you know, how's it like here, for example.
02:57:01.48 --> 02:57:03.20 So Thai Lopez, right?
02:57:03.20 --> 02:57:04.20 That's not it.
02:57:04.20 --> 02:57:05.20 I don't know.
02:57:05.20 --> 02:57:07.44 They all have like, I had every single time.
02:57:07.44 --> 02:57:08.44 Yeah, I know.
02:57:08.44 --> 02:57:11.28 You know, there's this other financial company, which is a weird one, which is, it's
02:57:11.28 --> 02:57:13.16 a really poorly done nonetheless.
02:57:13.16 --> 02:57:17.08 So Thai Lopez, here's the example, Thai Lopez, he'll be like, they'll talk about some
02:57:17.08 --> 02:57:18.08 stuff.
02:57:18.08 --> 02:57:22.24 And then after it's the same ad over and over and after a while, you're like, okay, okay, skip
02:57:22.24 --> 02:57:23.24 the ad.
02:57:23.24 --> 02:57:26.64 But then it kind of sticks with you and then you're kind of like, yeah, that's called advertising.
02:57:26.64 --> 02:57:27.64 I know.
02:57:27.64 --> 02:57:28.64 I know that's what I mean.
02:57:28.64 --> 02:57:31.08 Yeah, but it's kind of like, I see what's going on yet.
02:57:31.08 --> 02:57:32.96 I still am compelled, you know?
02:57:32.96 --> 02:57:35.36 So it's like, it's kind of like, it's beneficial almost.
02:57:35.36 --> 02:57:36.76 I'm over here, not compelled.
02:57:36.76 --> 02:57:37.76 It's not compelled.
02:57:37.76 --> 02:57:38.76 No.
02:57:38.76 --> 02:57:43.000 But I am compelled to subscribe to YouTube.
02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.000 Yeah, yeah, okay.
02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:45.000 There you go.
02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:48.000 So you're trying to say, you're saying a lot of other stuff right now.
02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:49.000 Well, you know, it's not helpful.
02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.60 I'm going to these tangents and it's relevant.
02:57:51.60 --> 02:57:56.000 I feel like people can relate on some level, sometimes.
02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:57.000 Maybe.
02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:58.000 Occasionally.
02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.000 Weird people.
02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.28 Nonetheless, YouTube, that's a good one.
02:58:01.28 --> 02:58:02.28 Video version.
02:58:02.28 --> 02:58:05.000 What's the, what's Jockel podcast is the channel?
02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:06.000 Yeah.
02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:07.000 To subscribe to.
02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:08.000 Yeah.
02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.36 It'd be cool if you put videos on there more often.
02:58:10.36 --> 02:58:12.76 I do stuff like two, three a week.
02:58:12.76 --> 02:58:14.44 Oh, yeah, two, three a week now.
02:58:14.44 --> 02:58:15.44 Kind of.
02:58:15.44 --> 02:58:16.44 Okay, good.
02:58:16.44 --> 02:58:17.44 I'm looking forward to that new.
02:58:17.44 --> 02:58:20.76 Whatever I put, I put one on the other, what is Monday?
02:58:20.76 --> 02:58:22.44 Yeah, okay, that's one.
02:58:22.44 --> 02:58:24.64 It's, it's whatever it is right now.
02:58:24.64 --> 02:58:25.64 Yeah, man.
02:58:25.64 --> 02:58:26.64 Thursday.
02:58:26.64 --> 02:58:27.64 No worries.
02:58:27.64 --> 02:58:28.64 I got you.
02:58:28.64 --> 02:58:30.96 Go subscribe to that if you haven't already.
02:58:30.96 --> 02:58:35.76 And you can get the video version and excerpts, which are shareable, shareable, meaning
02:58:35.76 --> 02:58:37.16 they're just shorter.
02:58:37.16 --> 02:58:38.16 They're shorter.
02:58:38.16 --> 02:58:42.12 So, you know, whoever opens it, they're going to be, then more of a chance they're going
02:58:42.12 --> 02:58:46.60 to listen to it when it's two, three minutes longer than two and a half, three and a half
02:58:46.60 --> 02:58:49.92 in this case hours long.
02:58:49.92 --> 02:58:50.92 That's just how.
02:58:50.92 --> 02:58:53.80 That's not fired from doing podcasts because they're too long.
02:58:53.80 --> 02:58:54.80 Is that possible?
02:58:54.80 --> 02:58:55.80 Maybe.
02:58:55.80 --> 02:58:57.80 I guess how they do it.
02:58:57.80 --> 02:58:58.80 What else?
02:58:58.80 --> 02:58:59.80 Anything is possible, right?
02:58:59.80 --> 02:59:00.80 That's the thing.
02:59:00.80 --> 02:59:01.80 What else?
02:59:01.80 --> 02:59:02.80 Jockel has a store.
02:59:02.80 --> 02:59:05.56 It's called Jockel Store.
02:59:05.56 --> 02:59:07.56 It's a site jockelstore.com.
02:59:07.56 --> 02:59:09.24 See, catchy, right?
02:59:09.24 --> 02:59:10.96 Easy to remember.
02:59:10.96 --> 02:59:13.44 If it's a store and it's jockels is jockel store.
02:59:13.44 --> 02:59:16.52 If it's a podcast and it's jockels is jockel podcast.
02:59:16.52 --> 02:59:19.04 If it's, you know, if it's key chains.
02:59:19.04 --> 02:59:20.24 I was meeting some people.
02:59:20.24 --> 02:59:21.24 Jockel key chains.
02:59:21.24 --> 02:59:27.000 I was meeting some people talking to some people at a group the other day who are not familiar
02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.68 with me or with anything.
02:59:29.68 --> 02:59:31.68 Got to respect.
02:59:31.68 --> 02:59:38.000 And they said, oh, well, do you, do you, or, you know, one of them said, oh, he's got a podcast.
02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.32 And then the other one said, oh, what's the name of the podcast?
02:59:40.32 --> 02:59:44.44 That's what all the podcasts he's called Jockel Podcast.
02:59:44.44 --> 02:59:47.20 And she said, this one, cross it.
02:59:47.20 --> 02:59:50.04 Did you pay your marketing team a lot for that?
02:59:50.04 --> 02:59:51.04 Yeah.
02:59:51.04 --> 02:59:53.48 And I said, yes, and the fact I did.
02:59:53.48 --> 02:59:55.48 You know, exactly.
02:59:55.48 --> 02:59:56.48 Real original like that.
02:59:56.48 --> 02:59:57.48 Yep.
02:59:57.48 --> 02:59:58.48 So original, but hey, man.
02:59:58.48 --> 03:00:00.72 You know, could be worse.
03:00:00.72 --> 03:00:03.08 So back to the store.
03:00:03.08 --> 03:00:04.88 Jockel store, that is.
03:00:04.88 --> 03:00:06.28 There's some t-shirts on there.
03:00:06.28 --> 03:00:09.84 If you want to represent, you know, the t-shirts carry a message.
03:00:09.84 --> 03:00:12.84 The message has layers.
03:00:12.84 --> 03:00:16.52 Actually, I guess technically the shirts have layers because the message is one of the
03:00:16.52 --> 03:00:17.52 layers of the shirt.
03:00:17.52 --> 03:00:18.52 You know what I mean?
03:00:18.52 --> 03:00:19.52 Anyway, go on there.
03:00:19.52 --> 03:00:20.52 Jockelstore.com.
03:00:20.52 --> 03:00:21.92 If you like something, get something.
03:00:21.92 --> 03:00:22.92 That's a good way to start.
03:00:22.92 --> 03:00:24.72 Our shirts coming out this week.
03:00:24.72 --> 03:00:25.72 That's my question to you.
03:00:25.72 --> 03:00:26.92 Yeah, that's the intention.
03:00:26.92 --> 03:00:28.72 Okay, so I'm getting angry.
03:00:28.72 --> 03:00:29.72 Yeah, I understand.
03:00:29.72 --> 03:00:32.72 But you know, make me not get in your business.
03:00:32.72 --> 03:00:33.72 Hey, normal face.
03:00:33.72 --> 03:00:34.72 Normal face.
03:00:34.72 --> 03:00:35.72 Normal face.
03:00:35.72 --> 03:00:36.72 My face is way normal.
03:00:36.72 --> 03:00:38.72 But don't make me come and get in your business and do your job for you.
03:00:38.72 --> 03:00:42.72 Because if you've ever heard me talk on this podcast, I talk about when people don't do their job.
03:00:42.72 --> 03:00:43.72 That's awesome.
03:00:43.72 --> 03:00:44.72 Because then I can take their job from them.
03:00:44.72 --> 03:00:45.72 Right, right.
03:00:45.72 --> 03:00:46.72 You got to step down.
03:00:46.72 --> 03:00:47.72 Think about where I'm more of my mindset is.
03:00:47.72 --> 03:00:49.72 And you may want to step it up over on your end.
03:00:49.72 --> 03:00:50.72 Oh, thank you.
03:00:50.72 --> 03:00:51.72 But to jump into the store.
03:00:51.72 --> 03:00:53.72 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:00:53.72 --> 03:00:54.72 No, no respect.
03:00:54.72 --> 03:00:56.72 I did it.
03:00:56.72 --> 03:00:57.72 And we're going to try to get that to do.
03:00:57.72 --> 03:00:59.72 Yeah, let's try it for you.
03:00:59.72 --> 03:01:01.72 No, let's do.
03:01:01.72 --> 03:01:07.72 You know why you're saying this right now because you can't wait for the shirt that you designed to come up.
03:01:07.72 --> 03:01:08.72 Because you want the recognition.
03:01:08.72 --> 03:01:16.72 Well, I also think your I think you might be sabotaging and sabotaging my efforts.
03:01:16.72 --> 03:01:18.72 I made the better shirt.
03:01:18.72 --> 03:01:24.72 And you don't want to print it because your self-conscious.
03:01:24.72 --> 03:01:26.72 And that's not going to stand.
03:01:26.72 --> 03:01:30.72 Well, I will give you the respect because there is in fact layers to this shirt as well.
03:01:30.72 --> 03:01:33.72 So all right, how about this more layers more layers.
03:01:33.72 --> 03:01:35.72 Oh, yeah, yeah, you could be right.
03:01:35.72 --> 03:01:38.72 I think you might have more layers than the standard.
03:01:38.72 --> 03:01:40.72 I guess we'll see.
03:01:40.72 --> 03:01:41.72 We're going to find out about that one.
03:01:41.72 --> 03:01:42.72 Anyway, jockels.com.
03:01:42.72 --> 03:01:43.72 So women's stuff on there as well.

03:01:47.72 --> 03:01:48.72 Yeah.
03:01:48.72 --> 03:01:49.72 Indeed.
03:01:49.72 --> 03:01:50.72 Some huddies.
03:01:50.72 --> 03:01:51.72 Other stuff.
03:01:51.72 --> 03:01:52.72 Anyway, go on there.
03:01:52.72 --> 03:01:53.72 Check it out.
03:01:53.72 --> 03:01:54.72 If you want something, get something.
03:01:54.72 --> 03:01:56.72 Also, psychological warfare.
03:01:56.72 --> 03:01:58.72 If you're having trouble.
03:01:58.72 --> 03:02:00.72 If you're having trouble.
03:02:00.72 --> 03:02:07.72 If you're like me and sometimes you do or currently having trouble with not feeling like working out.
03:02:07.72 --> 03:02:09.72 Not feeling like it.
03:02:09.72 --> 03:02:16.72 So you're considering skipping the workout, waiting for tomorrow, making your workout day into a rest day.
03:02:16.72 --> 03:02:18.72 If you're having that problem, this is what you do.
03:02:18.72 --> 03:02:21.72 Psychological warfare search on iTunes.
03:02:21.72 --> 03:02:22.72 Google Boy.
03:02:22.72 --> 03:02:23.72 Amazon.
03:02:23.72 --> 03:02:26.72 So anyway, where you can get MP3s, you search psychological warfare.
03:02:26.72 --> 03:02:29.72 Jockel willink.
03:02:29.72 --> 03:02:32.72 And it's an album.
03:02:32.72 --> 03:02:33.72 Witcher.
03:02:33.72 --> 03:02:39.72 And these tracks will help you through anything that you're feeling that weakness, like I just mentioned,
03:02:39.72 --> 03:02:43.72 whether it be waking up early or skipping the workout or cheating on the diet.
03:02:43.72 --> 03:02:45.72 And I say cheating on the diet.
03:02:45.72 --> 03:02:48.72 Because you made a promise to yourself, you're not going to eat those donuts.
03:02:48.72 --> 03:02:49.72 You made a promise.
03:02:49.72 --> 03:02:51.72 And then now like all of us on all of them.
03:02:51.72 --> 03:02:52.72 Eat the donuts.
03:02:52.72 --> 03:02:54.72 No, that's not the promise you made.
03:02:54.72 --> 03:02:56.72 Just think I can never eat a donut again.
03:02:56.72 --> 03:02:57.72 No, sure.
03:02:57.72 --> 03:02:58.72 Exactly right.
03:02:58.72 --> 03:03:02.72 Because everyone in the world will, like, somewhat, be there with a camera.
03:03:02.72 --> 03:03:03.72 Yeah.
03:03:03.72 --> 03:03:05.72 And they'll get me a pop at the end.
03:03:05.72 --> 03:03:06.72 Yeah, yeah, pop at the end.
03:03:06.72 --> 03:03:11.72 And consider this, like, what if you knew 100% know once, you know, watch whatever.
03:03:11.72 --> 03:03:12.72 And then you're eating the donut.
03:03:12.72 --> 03:03:13.72 Can you imagine the guilt?
03:03:13.72 --> 03:03:14.72 Yeah.
03:03:14.72 --> 03:03:15.72 You're feeling like you're a guilt.
03:03:15.72 --> 03:03:16.72 Yeah, you can do it.
03:03:16.72 --> 03:03:17.72 You're done.
03:03:17.72 --> 03:03:18.72 Don't let the time.
03:03:18.72 --> 03:03:24.72 You know, but in the event of other people, not you do other people feeling that weakness.
03:03:24.72 --> 03:03:25.72 There's a track for that.
03:03:25.72 --> 03:03:31.72 Remember back when I phone kind of came out and there's that thing.
03:03:31.72 --> 03:03:32.72 There's an app for that.
03:03:32.72 --> 03:03:34.72 Remember that you always say that.
03:03:34.72 --> 03:03:35.72 Oh, there's an app for that.
03:03:35.72 --> 03:03:36.72 There's an app for that.
03:03:36.72 --> 03:03:37.72 That was like an expression.
03:03:37.72 --> 03:03:38.72 Okay.
03:03:38.72 --> 03:03:40.72 Look, with this, there's a track for that.
03:03:40.72 --> 03:03:43.72 You just made that up right now.
03:03:43.72 --> 03:03:44.72 Anyway, psychological warfare.
03:03:44.72 --> 03:03:45.72 You check it.
03:03:45.72 --> 03:03:46.72 If you need that.
03:03:46.72 --> 03:03:49.72 If you need that, that's spot.
03:03:49.72 --> 03:03:50.72 Because really, that's what it is.
03:03:50.72 --> 03:03:52.72 It's a spot in life.
03:03:52.72 --> 03:03:55.72 When you're trying to live heavy things, it's good to have a spot.
03:03:55.72 --> 03:03:58.72 If you're living light stuff or not lifting that all you need a spot.
03:03:58.72 --> 03:04:00.72 So don't even worry about that.
03:04:00.72 --> 03:04:01.72 If you're not doing nothing, don't even get this.
03:04:01.72 --> 03:04:02.72 You don't even need it.
03:04:02.72 --> 03:04:05.72 If you're not doing anything in life, don't get it.
03:04:05.72 --> 03:04:06.72 You shouldn't say.
03:04:06.72 --> 03:04:07.72 Yeah.
03:04:07.72 --> 03:04:07.72 Let's try.
03:04:07.72 --> 03:04:08.72 Let's try.
03:04:08.72 --> 03:04:08.72 Get it.
03:04:08.72 --> 03:04:09.72 Check.
03:04:09.72 --> 03:04:10.72 All right.
03:04:10.72 --> 03:04:11.72 Like I said, 18, we'll tune.
03:04:11.72 --> 03:04:13.72 You can get that at riflesdirect.com from the UK.
03:04:13.72 --> 03:04:15.72 It supports that regimen, which I'm all about.
03:04:15.72 --> 03:04:20.72 Also, you know, speaking of rash guards and stuff, check out originmain.com.
03:04:20.72 --> 03:04:26.72 My boy up there Pete Roberts, he's kind of a, he's kind of a psycho.
03:04:26.72 --> 03:04:29.72 Actually, kind of a madman.
03:04:29.72 --> 03:04:32.72 He's all about manufacturing in America, which I'm all about to.
03:04:32.72 --> 03:04:37.72 And I'm going to go into this at some point, but like you wanted to make guise here.
03:04:37.72 --> 03:04:38.72 And you couldn't get the fabric.
03:04:38.72 --> 03:04:42.72 So he went out and bought old abandoned looms from abandoned factories.
03:04:42.72 --> 03:04:48.72 And hired old timers that knew how to work these things and refer to them and rebuilt them.
03:04:48.72 --> 03:04:53.72 And has made these looms brought them back to life so they can make guise and rash guards.
03:04:53.72 --> 03:04:55.72 Here in America, in Maine.
03:04:55.72 --> 03:05:02.72 And like I said, that's kind of crazy borderline psychopathic, which I kind of like.
03:05:02.72 --> 03:05:08.72 And yeah, that's kind of why we're kind of working on joining forces in some way.
03:05:08.72 --> 03:05:13.72 Pete origin, warpath.
03:05:13.72 --> 03:05:15.72 It's going down.
03:05:15.72 --> 03:05:16.72 We're going to make something happen.
03:05:16.72 --> 03:05:20.72 I'll keep everyone informed as we finalize the plan.
03:05:20.72 --> 03:05:22.72 That rash guard that you mentioned.
03:05:22.72 --> 03:05:23.72 Yeah.
03:05:23.72 --> 03:05:25.72 And posted the video.
03:05:25.72 --> 03:05:26.72 Yeah.
03:05:26.72 --> 03:05:27.72 That was a lot nicer.
03:05:27.72 --> 03:05:30.72 Is a lot nicer in legit than I am.
03:05:30.72 --> 03:05:32.72 Yes, when you see it, it's underplayed.
03:05:32.72 --> 03:05:34.72 You're like, yeah, well, you didn't know.
03:05:34.72 --> 03:05:37.72 I made it sound like just kind of cheesy.
03:05:37.72 --> 03:05:38.72 Yeah, like you.
03:05:38.72 --> 03:05:42.72 But you didn't realize it was actually savvy.
03:05:42.72 --> 03:05:47.72 But the thing is that rash guard, it's already sold out.
03:05:47.72 --> 03:05:53.72 You know, so now he's printing a bunch more, but he's got to weave the material.
03:05:53.72 --> 03:05:54.72 Yeah, right?
03:05:54.72 --> 03:05:57.72 Or he gets, he gets one of his producers here in America.
03:05:57.72 --> 03:05:58.72 We submit to real so anyways.
03:05:58.72 --> 03:06:03.72 Check out that origin main dot com growing company.
03:06:03.72 --> 03:06:05.72 We're getting in league with them.
03:06:05.72 --> 03:06:07.72 And we're getting a big time.
03:06:07.72 --> 03:06:10.72 Also, jocquait on Amazon.
03:06:10.72 --> 03:06:16.72 Here's an actual, again, this is a certified verified report.
03:06:16.72 --> 03:06:20.72 I have a cat that used to catch one or two mice per month.
03:06:20.72 --> 03:06:23.72 I forgot to pick up a tea bag after I brewed it.
03:06:23.72 --> 03:06:25.72 And the cat ate the tea bag.
03:06:25.72 --> 03:06:30.72 Now my cat is bringing home raccoons, full grown rabbits, and even the neighbors dog.
03:06:30.72 --> 03:06:31.72 So be careful.
03:06:31.72 --> 03:06:34.72 Don't let your cat get it unless your neighbor's dog has been annoying.
03:06:34.72 --> 03:06:36.72 No, that's jocquait.
03:06:36.72 --> 03:06:37.72 You can have it.
03:06:37.72 --> 03:06:40.72 And it's not, doesn't take, the thing is doesn't taste like normal tea.
03:06:40.72 --> 03:06:42.72 You taste like victory.
03:06:42.72 --> 03:06:43.72 All right.
03:06:43.72 --> 03:06:46.72 Way the warrior kid boom.
03:06:46.72 --> 03:06:48.72 Also, this is a warning about way the warrior kid.
03:06:48.72 --> 03:06:54.72 When you order way the warrior kid, just go ahead and also order a pull-up bar.
03:06:54.72 --> 03:06:58.72 Some flashcards, some healthy food, and a jiu-jitsu geek.
03:06:58.72 --> 03:07:03.72 Because when your kid gets done reading this factually, they're going to want to be stronger, better, tougher.
03:07:03.72 --> 03:07:04.72 And smarter.
03:07:04.72 --> 03:07:11.72 So supply them the way they need to be supplied, quit playing around, get some.
03:07:11.72 --> 03:07:16.72 Also, the discipline equals freedom field manual.
03:07:16.72 --> 03:07:18.72 There's no book like this.
03:07:18.72 --> 03:07:19.72 Doesn't exist.
03:07:19.72 --> 03:07:22.72 It is not a normal book.
03:07:22.72 --> 03:07:24.72 It's kind of like the podcast.
03:07:24.72 --> 03:07:27.72 This podcast is not for everyone.
03:07:27.72 --> 03:07:30.72 Not everyone wants to listen to this podcast.
03:07:30.72 --> 03:07:31.72 That's okay.
03:07:31.72 --> 03:07:34.72 I'm not making a podcast for everyone.
03:07:34.72 --> 03:07:39.72 We're making a podcast for people that like to get after it.
03:07:39.72 --> 03:07:47.72 So this book is not for people that want to read junk.
03:07:47.72 --> 03:07:49.72 Some people don't get the podcast.
03:07:49.72 --> 03:07:51.72 Some people aren't going to understand the book.
03:07:51.72 --> 03:07:53.72 They're not going to know where it's coming from.
03:07:53.72 --> 03:07:55.72 That's okay.
03:07:55.72 --> 03:08:00.72 I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not toning down the podcast.
03:08:00.72 --> 03:08:03.72 We're not saying, oh, you know what?
03:08:03.72 --> 03:08:08.72 I think everyone would like it more if we did more, you know, interspersed some jokes throughout it.
03:08:08.72 --> 03:08:14.72 And maybe if we made it a 45 minutes and do a little fun presentation and I get some back up music.
03:08:14.72 --> 03:08:17.72 Just to kind of a little jangle to make people get in the spirit.
03:08:17.72 --> 03:08:20.72 We're not doing that.
03:08:20.72 --> 03:08:21.72 Not happening.
03:08:21.72 --> 03:08:22.72 Yeah.
03:08:22.72 --> 03:08:29.72 If you want to listen to a little jangle or a little, you know, metallic riff to get you in the zone on the beginning of the podcast.
03:08:29.72 --> 03:08:30.72 That's cool.
03:08:30.72 --> 03:08:31.72 If you want that, that's awesome.
03:08:31.72 --> 03:08:32.72 There's other podcasts that offer it.
03:08:32.72 --> 03:08:33.72 We don't offer it here.
03:08:33.72 --> 03:08:36.72 You know what you're going to get with the book.
03:08:36.72 --> 03:08:44.72 If you're looking for a, you know, 50 shades of gray, you're not going to get that.
03:08:44.72 --> 03:08:45.72 But that's the cool thing.
03:08:45.72 --> 03:08:50.72 The cool thing is that the publisher let me do whatever I wanted to do.
03:08:50.72 --> 03:08:51.72 So I did.
03:08:51.72 --> 03:08:58.72 And I made the feeling, you're going to feel that the feeling of the podcast.
03:08:58.72 --> 03:09:05.72 The feeling of the podcast is the same feeling that the book gets you.
03:09:05.72 --> 03:09:07.72 So it's.
03:09:07.72 --> 03:09:09.72 Little heavy.
03:09:09.72 --> 03:09:11.72 Little dark, right?

03:09:24.72 --> 03:09:27.72 It's not printed on white paper.
03:09:27.72 --> 03:09:30.72 So the straight up, let's just go from there.
03:09:30.72 --> 03:09:32.72 It's actually printed.
03:09:32.72 --> 03:09:37.72 The background is all images.
03:09:37.72 --> 03:09:39.72 Black and white images.

03:09:53.72 --> 03:09:54.72 It's about leadership.
03:09:54.72 --> 03:09:56.72 Actually it's about combat leadership.
03:09:56.72 --> 03:10:02.72 And how you can take the combat leadership principles that we've learned on the battlefield
03:10:02.72 --> 03:10:03.72 and climb to your life.
03:10:03.72 --> 03:10:04.72 You can get that book too.

03:10:18.72 --> 03:10:21.72 You just heard Sydney Jerry saying it.
03:10:21.72 --> 03:10:24.72 A leadership is the thing that makes you overcome.
03:10:24.72 --> 03:10:27.72 Seemingly impossible things.
03:10:27.72 --> 03:10:29.72 So if your leadership isn't square away,
03:10:29.72 --> 03:10:31.72 you're not going to overcome them.

03:10:36.72 --> 03:10:38.72 If you want that.
03:10:38.72 --> 03:10:42.72 Also the monster we just got back from the Austin monster.
03:10:42.72 --> 03:10:43.72 Outstanding.
03:10:43.72 --> 03:10:44.72 Outstanding.
03:10:44.72 --> 03:10:45.72 It was awesome.
03:10:45.72 --> 03:10:47.72 So many great people in there.
03:10:47.72 --> 03:10:50.72 Lessons learned knowledge spread.
03:10:50.72 --> 03:10:53.72 Tim Kennedy was there.
03:10:53.72 --> 03:10:55.72 Tim Kennedy showed up.
03:10:55.72 --> 03:10:57.72 And it was cool.
03:10:57.72 --> 03:11:01.72 And I didn't realize it until we were at Gitu.
03:11:01.72 --> 03:11:04.72 And I think I came up to you and said this during Gitu.
03:11:04.72 --> 03:11:06.72 So the last night we had Thursday.
03:11:06.72 --> 03:11:08.72 Then Friday and the Friday night we go to Gitu.
03:11:08.72 --> 03:11:11.72 We went to 10th planet at Austin.
03:11:11.72 --> 03:11:12.72 Austin 10th planet.
03:11:12.72 --> 03:11:14.72 Gitu with my boy Curtis.
03:11:14.72 --> 03:11:16.72 Todd White was there.
03:11:16.72 --> 03:11:17.72 And Todd White was staying.
03:11:17.72 --> 03:11:18.72 Who represent?
03:11:18.72 --> 03:11:20.72 Yeah, he's an old school.
03:11:20.72 --> 03:11:23.72 He's me and him are from the same era.
03:11:23.72 --> 03:11:24.72 Yeah.
03:11:24.72 --> 03:11:28.72 We're from the same era from back in the day.
03:11:28.72 --> 03:11:30.72 Only he's a better artist.
03:11:30.72 --> 03:11:32.72 A better artist in me.
03:11:32.72 --> 03:11:37.72 So what we went and what I realized is this.
03:11:37.72 --> 03:11:40.72 You know like way the warrior kid.
03:11:40.72 --> 03:11:43.72 People say, oh man, I wish I had that book when I was a kid.
03:11:43.72 --> 03:11:44.72 An extreme ownership.
03:11:44.72 --> 03:11:48.72 People say, oh man, I wish I had that book when I started out.
03:11:48.72 --> 03:11:51.72 And when I got promoted five years ago.
03:11:51.72 --> 03:11:53.72 And you know what I say about way the warrior kid?
03:11:53.72 --> 03:11:55.72 I wish I had it when I was a kid.
03:11:55.72 --> 03:11:57.72 You know what I say about extreme ownership?
03:11:57.72 --> 03:12:00.72 I wish I had it when I was a assistant,
03:12:00.72 --> 03:12:01.72 a student, a student, a commuter.
03:12:01.72 --> 03:12:02.72 I wish I had it.
03:12:02.72 --> 03:12:03.72 I didn't have it.
03:12:03.72 --> 03:12:05.72 And what's cool about the monster is.
03:12:05.72 --> 03:12:07.72 So that feeling when you go to the monster,
03:12:07.72 --> 03:12:12.72 you're giving just like we're just giving this massive amount of information.
03:12:12.72 --> 03:12:17.72 Pragmatic information that you can take and you can execute with.
03:12:17.72 --> 03:12:22.72 And so when we were at GJitsu, I realized man, we just all this.
03:12:22.72 --> 03:12:26.72 These people in this room just got all this information.
03:12:26.72 --> 03:12:30.72 And it and it's so practical that you can take back your team.
03:12:30.72 --> 03:12:32.72 And then on top of all that, here's a little something else.
03:12:32.72 --> 03:12:33.72 GJitsu.
03:12:33.72 --> 03:12:34.72 Yeah.
03:12:34.72 --> 03:12:40.72 Because only one quarter of the people that came to GJitsu had ever trained GJitsu before.
03:12:40.72 --> 03:12:41.72 Yeah.
03:12:41.72 --> 03:12:45.72 The other was a 50 people that had never trained before.
03:12:45.72 --> 03:12:48.72 So they're getting this gift, the gift of GJitsu.
03:12:48.72 --> 03:12:49.72 The little angel.
03:12:49.72 --> 03:12:50.72 Yeah.
03:12:50.72 --> 03:12:51.72 Little angel now.
03:12:51.72 --> 03:12:54.72 I would say 50% of them will go back and start training.
03:12:54.72 --> 03:12:55.72 Yeah.
03:12:55.72 --> 03:12:56.72 Maybe more.
03:12:56.72 --> 03:12:57.72 I wish it was 100%.
03:12:57.72 --> 03:12:58.72 Yeah, it might be.
03:12:58.72 --> 03:12:59.72 Yeah.
03:12:59.72 --> 03:13:01.72 It'd be a depends on what you're into.
03:13:01.72 --> 03:13:02.72 Yeah.
03:13:02.72 --> 03:13:03.72 It's hard.
03:13:03.72 --> 03:13:06.72 It was always bizarre to me that when I introduced someone to GJitsu.
03:13:06.72 --> 03:13:07.72 It was a 100%.
03:13:07.72 --> 03:13:08.72 It was a 100%.
03:13:08.72 --> 03:13:09.72 I don't know.
03:13:09.72 --> 03:13:10.72 It's a 100% conversion rate.
03:13:10.72 --> 03:13:11.72 Yeah.
03:13:11.72 --> 03:13:12.72 100%.
03:13:12.72 --> 03:13:14.72 Oh, you just chokes me and I couldn't stop you.
03:13:14.72 --> 03:13:15.72 I didn't even learn that 100%.
03:13:15.72 --> 03:13:18.72 Otherwise, I go through life vulnerable to being choked by anyone.
03:13:18.72 --> 03:13:19.72 I don't like that feeling.
03:13:19.72 --> 03:13:20.72 Yeah.
03:13:20.72 --> 03:13:22.72 No, I don't like that feeling.
03:13:22.72 --> 03:13:28.72 The mustard too is sprinkled and I mean, heart sprinkle hard, by the way, which is a very critical
03:13:28.72 --> 03:13:29.72 compelling part.
03:13:29.72 --> 03:13:31.72 In my opinion, is this social stuff.
03:13:31.72 --> 03:13:34.72 And I don't mean social like you're just cruising and not learning.
03:13:34.72 --> 03:13:36.72 I mean, the people you meet.
03:13:36.72 --> 03:13:37.72 Oh, yeah.
03:13:37.72 --> 03:13:41.72 Well, you definitely are going to meet good people there because everyone there is in the game
03:13:41.72 --> 03:13:42.72 big dime.
03:13:42.72 --> 03:13:43.72 And they're all looking to get better.
03:13:43.72 --> 03:13:45.72 They're all invested to get better.
03:13:45.72 --> 03:13:49.72 And the other thing is, you know, we're hanging out.
03:13:49.72 --> 03:13:52.72 I said, I mean, yeah, yeah, no, there's me,
03:13:52.72 --> 03:13:54.72 Lave, Dave, J.P. Echo.
03:13:54.72 --> 03:13:55.72 We're not.
03:13:55.72 --> 03:13:56.72 There's no green room.
03:13:56.72 --> 03:13:57.72 It doesn't exist.
03:13:57.72 --> 03:13:58.72 We don't even take breaks.
03:13:58.72 --> 03:14:08.72 Just like when we take a break to let the audience like go to the restaurant or grab a, you know, a cup of coffee or a
03:14:08.72 --> 03:14:15.72 chocolate tea, we just, we just stand there. Like we step down off of stage and we get everything lines up.
03:14:15.72 --> 03:14:21.72 We talk questions and you know what I was doing this time was I was like, instead of answering one person's question just to that person.
03:14:21.72 --> 03:14:22.72 I was in a room.
03:14:22.72 --> 03:14:25.72 Because he's asking the question, everyone coming here is near anybody.
03:14:25.72 --> 03:14:28.72 Hey, there's there's 12 people standing in line.
03:14:28.72 --> 03:14:29.72 Yeah.
03:14:29.72 --> 03:14:32.72 And instead of answering this one question, this one guy was bring no.
03:14:32.72 --> 03:14:33.72 Hey, everyone come up here.
03:14:33.72 --> 03:14:34.72 Come on up here.
03:14:34.72 --> 03:14:34.72 Yeah.
03:14:34.72 --> 03:14:36.72 And you can all hear this because what's your who knows?
03:14:36.72 --> 03:14:39.72 Maybe those are some of those questions. Maybe it's something you're going to experience in the future. I don't know.
03:14:39.72 --> 03:14:43.72 But you might as well listen and maybe you have a better solution than I have.
03:14:43.72 --> 03:14:45.72 Yeah. So it's like a like a little.
03:14:45.72 --> 03:14:46.72 A little break down table. Yeah.
03:14:46.72 --> 03:14:47.72 Break down.
03:14:47.72 --> 03:14:48.72 Yeah.
03:14:48.72 --> 03:14:48.72 Yeah.
03:14:48.72 --> 03:14:49.72 It's cool.
03:14:49.72 --> 03:14:50.72 That's true.
03:14:50.72 --> 03:14:50.72 You.
03:14:50.72 --> 03:14:51.72 We take breaks.
03:14:51.72 --> 03:14:53.72 Everyone, there's breaks throughout the thing.
03:14:53.72 --> 03:14:54.72 You take breaks.
03:14:54.72 --> 03:14:54.72 Yeah.
03:14:54.72 --> 03:14:55.72 Jock on.
03:14:55.72 --> 03:14:56.72 Don't take breaks.
03:14:56.72 --> 03:14:58.72 Because break time is talk time.
03:14:58.72 --> 03:14:59.72 It's talk time.
03:14:59.72 --> 03:14:59.72 You guys.
03:14:59.72 --> 03:15:00.72 You're a little slow.
03:15:00.72 --> 03:15:00.72 Yeah.
03:15:00.72 --> 03:15:01.72 Yeah.
03:15:01.72 --> 03:15:02.72 Sign a book.
03:15:02.72 --> 03:15:03.72 Whatever.
03:15:03.72 --> 03:15:04.72 Yeah.
03:15:04.72 --> 03:15:05.72 No green room.
03:15:05.72 --> 03:15:05.72 No green room.
03:15:05.72 --> 03:15:07.72 So that's the master.
03:15:07.72 --> 03:15:13.72 And by the way, they've sold out all of them that we've done have been sold out.
03:15:13.72 --> 03:15:19.72 Now the next one that we got coming up is September 14th and 15th back the Omni hotel in downtown San Diego, California,
03:15:19.72 --> 03:15:20.72 Master Zero Zero Four.
03:15:20.72 --> 03:15:22.72 It's gonna sell out.
03:15:22.72 --> 03:15:23.72 This is a known fact.
03:15:23.72 --> 03:15:28.72 So if you want to come, it's September 14th and 15th, that is right around the corner.
03:15:28.72 --> 03:15:29.72 Yeah.

03:15:32.72 --> 03:15:36.72 Extremeownership.com is where you can register if you want to.
03:15:36.72 --> 03:15:38.72 Also, by the way, this is interesting.
03:15:38.72 --> 03:15:42.72 If you train you Jitsu or if you're interested in training Jitsu,
03:15:42.72 --> 03:15:44.72 or you're interested in training Jitsu,
03:15:44.72 --> 03:15:50.72 Origin, up in Maine has this immersion camp that they do.
03:15:50.72 --> 03:15:52.72 I'm going.
03:15:52.72 --> 03:15:54.72 Echo's going with me.
03:15:54.72 --> 03:15:56.72 We're going up there.
03:15:56.72 --> 03:15:57.72 It is.
03:15:57.72 --> 03:15:59.72 There's two sessions that they run.
03:15:59.72 --> 03:16:04.72 It's the 20th August, 20th, the 23rd or August 24th through the 27th.
03:16:04.72 --> 03:16:05.72 Those are the two different sessions.
03:16:05.72 --> 03:16:07.72 Or you can come for the whole week.
03:16:07.72 --> 03:16:11.72 Anyways, I'm going to be there for those middle three days.
03:16:11.72 --> 03:16:12.72 Like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
03:16:12.72 --> 03:16:16.72 So I'm going to be there for the last day of the first camp on the first day of the
03:16:16.72 --> 03:16:18.72 lot of the second camp.
03:16:18.72 --> 03:16:20.72 And I'll be on there on the middle day.
03:16:20.72 --> 03:16:24.72 We're going to be training rolling, talking, hanging out, eating lobster, eating
03:16:24.72 --> 03:16:27.72 steaks, just generally getting after it.
03:16:27.72 --> 03:16:30.72 So you're going to origin Maine.com.
03:16:30.72 --> 03:16:33.72 If you want to come up, there's not a lot of spaces for that.
03:16:33.72 --> 03:16:39.72 It's not that's like I think the most they're going to go is 200 people.
03:16:39.72 --> 03:16:42.72 So that's not a lot of spaces.
03:16:42.72 --> 03:16:45.72 So if you want to come up, register quick.
03:16:45.72 --> 03:16:47.72 And I'll see you guys up there in Maine.
03:16:47.72 --> 03:16:52.72 What I like about it is, unlike the monster, where everything is scheduled,
03:16:52.72 --> 03:16:54.72 like we don't have a lot of break time.
03:16:54.72 --> 03:16:56.72 And even the break time is working.
03:16:56.72 --> 03:16:59.72 This thing, I mean, you can only train you, Jitsu.
03:16:59.72 --> 03:17:00.72 What?
03:17:00.72 --> 03:17:01.72 Six hours a day, maybe?
03:17:01.72 --> 03:17:02.72 10, probably.
03:17:02.72 --> 03:17:03.72 You know what I mean?
03:17:03.72 --> 03:17:06.72 Two hours in the morning, two hours at lunch, two hours in the evening.
03:17:06.72 --> 03:17:08.72 So that's six hours.
03:17:08.72 --> 03:17:09.72 You're going to sleep four hours.
03:17:09.72 --> 03:17:11.72 So you still got 14 hours left in the day.
03:17:11.72 --> 03:17:12.72 So what are we going to do?
03:17:12.72 --> 03:17:13.72 We're going to kick it.
03:17:13.72 --> 03:17:14.72 Yeah.
