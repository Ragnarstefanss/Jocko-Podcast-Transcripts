00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.20 This is Jockel Podcast number 120.
00:00:04.20 --> 00:00:07.40 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.40 Good evening, I go.
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:09.90 Good evening.
00:00:09.90 --> 00:00:12.20 So it's been a while since Q&A.
00:00:12.20 --> 00:00:13.20 Yeah.
00:00:13.20 --> 00:00:16.20 So we have some Q&A from the interwebs.
00:00:16.20 --> 00:00:17.000 Yeah.
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000 Go.
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.20 First question.
00:00:20.20 --> 00:00:23.20 Jockel.
00:00:23.20 --> 00:00:28.40 More than once on the podcast, you've mentioned how the teams were so competitive
00:00:28.40 --> 00:00:34.32 that no one wanted to admit when they were cold, being too cold puts you at a tactical disadvantage.
00:00:34.32 --> 00:00:37.92 In hindsight, was that a failure to control your ego?
00:00:37.92 --> 00:00:40.28 So your ego doesn't control you.
00:00:40.28 --> 00:00:42.80 I didn't ask this question out of idle curiosity.
00:00:42.80 --> 00:00:46.48 A lot of folks in an active duty listed to the podcast and I'm concerned they might put
00:00:46.48 --> 00:00:47.48 themselves.
00:00:47.48 --> 00:00:51.84 Their teammates and their mission in jeopardy because of their ego's won't let them admit
00:00:51.84 --> 00:00:53.44 their too hot or too cold.
00:00:53.44 --> 00:00:54.44 All right.
00:00:54.44 --> 00:00:59.64 So good question.
00:00:59.64 --> 00:01:00.64 Good point.
00:01:00.64 --> 00:01:03.16 And there's definitely a big difference between being uncomfortably cold, right?
00:01:03.16 --> 00:01:08.56 Like you're just uncomfortably cold or uncomfortably hot or uncomfortably thirsty or
00:01:08.56 --> 00:01:10.20 hungry or whatever.
00:01:10.20 --> 00:01:14.96 And being in an actual state where you're putting the mission in jeopardy because you're
00:01:14.96 --> 00:01:18.20 too cold or hot or thirsty or whatever.
00:01:18.20 --> 00:01:20.12 So I just needed to say this.
00:01:20.12 --> 00:01:28.96 In the teams, you are 95% of the time you are cold, too cold, too hot, too wet, too
00:01:28.96 --> 00:01:31.16 thirsty, too miserable, something.
00:01:31.16 --> 00:01:32.16 There's no time.
00:01:32.16 --> 00:01:35.44 When you're in the field, you put on a hundred pounds worse or worse or worse or worse
00:01:35.44 --> 00:01:36.04 or worse or worse or worse or worse or worse or worse.
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:39.56 You're uncomfortable from the word go.
00:01:39.56 --> 00:01:41.04 From the word go.
00:01:41.04 --> 00:01:43.56 And you're cold.
00:01:43.56 --> 00:01:45.20 You come in over the beach.
00:01:45.20 --> 00:01:47.24 You're in wet camis.
00:01:47.24 --> 00:01:48.24 It doesn't matter.
00:01:48.24 --> 00:01:49.80 You come out with great technology.
00:01:49.80 --> 00:01:51.04 We got to dry suit of this.
00:01:51.04 --> 00:01:52.04 We got to wet suit that.
00:01:52.04 --> 00:01:54.36 No, you're miserable.
00:01:54.36 --> 00:01:55.56 You're going to be cold.
00:01:55.56 --> 00:01:56.68 You're going to be uncomfortable.
00:01:56.68 --> 00:01:58.96 You're riding a zodiac.
00:01:58.96 --> 00:02:04.76 First you're riding a big rib, which is like a 10 meter boat.
00:02:04.76 --> 00:02:07.04 And you have your zodiacs on that boat.
00:02:07.04 --> 00:02:07.80 So you're in that boat.
00:02:07.80 --> 00:02:09.36 You're getting sprayed with water.
00:02:09.36 --> 00:02:11.16 You're getting bounced up and down.
00:02:11.16 --> 00:02:13.56 You do that for three hours.
00:02:13.56 --> 00:02:15.56 And then you launch your little boats into the water.
00:02:15.56 --> 00:02:17.56 Well, while you're doing that, you fall in the water.
00:02:17.56 --> 00:02:20.44 You slip, you get sprayed more, you're covered in water.
00:02:20.44 --> 00:02:23.04 By the way, the water's not warm.
00:02:23.04 --> 00:02:26.32 And then you've got to, because you're going to travel then 15 knots.
00:02:26.32 --> 00:02:31.84 So you've got to feel facing a 15 knot headwind for the another two hours in a zodiac.
00:02:31.84 --> 00:02:34.08 And then you're going to get in the water and swim both between.
00:02:34.08 --> 00:02:35.92 You're going to be cold.
00:02:35.92 --> 00:02:37.92 That's just the way it is.
00:02:37.92 --> 00:02:39.88 And you can't complain about that.
00:02:39.88 --> 00:02:41.40 So and you don't complain about it.
00:02:41.40 --> 00:02:43.64 In the teams, you just keep your mouth shut.
00:02:43.64 --> 00:02:44.64 That's what you do.
00:02:44.64 --> 00:02:45.64 Keep your mouth shut.
00:02:45.64 --> 00:02:48.32 The big distinction here is this is correct.
00:02:48.32 --> 00:02:52.44 If you're going to get high pithermia or you're going to get a heat stroke or you're going
00:02:52.44 --> 00:02:55.88 to go down from dehydration, then yeah, you've got to speak up and be, you're going to say,
00:02:55.88 --> 00:02:56.88 hey, guess what?
00:02:56.88 --> 00:02:58.40 I got an issue here.
00:02:58.40 --> 00:03:02.92 I'm starting to get dizzy or I'm starting to get lightheaded or whatever.
00:03:02.92 --> 00:03:08.80 Yeah, if you cross the line to where it goes from discomfort to actual problem, then you
00:03:08.80 --> 00:03:13.80 definitely need to speak up.
00:03:13.80 --> 00:03:14.80 It does happen.
00:03:14.80 --> 00:03:15.80 It happens a lot actually.
00:03:15.80 --> 00:03:23.04 When we do our land warfare training in the desert, in the summertime, it's 120 degree heat.
00:03:23.04 --> 00:03:24.04 You're going to take heat catch.
00:03:24.04 --> 00:03:27.92 Please, when I was running training, we used to just have premeditated heat casualties
00:03:27.92 --> 00:03:28.92 evacuation.
00:03:28.92 --> 00:03:30.48 Because we knew someone was going to go down.
00:03:30.48 --> 00:03:33.04 That's just the way it's going to happen.
00:03:33.04 --> 00:03:38.40 Because you've got 40 guys that are all turning and burning and they're all running on
00:03:38.40 --> 00:03:40.36 three or four hours of sleep.
00:03:40.36 --> 00:03:44.44 And then they're going out in the field and they just got back from the field and there's
00:03:44.44 --> 00:03:46.44 no time to rehydrate.
00:03:46.44 --> 00:03:50.60 Okay, there's time, but some guys might forget to rehydrate.
00:03:50.60 --> 00:03:52.92 Next thing you know, you've got to go down.
00:03:52.92 --> 00:03:56.48 The stuff does happen.
00:03:56.48 --> 00:03:59.80 Yeah, you've got to let your team know it's going on.
00:03:59.80 --> 00:04:07.60 The closest call I had, I was on a long patrol training patrol in the Ozark Mountains
00:04:07.60 --> 00:04:10.96 of Arkansas, it was summertime, it was hot.
00:04:10.96 --> 00:04:14.60 We were planning to pump water, meaning you bring a little water filtration system into
00:04:14.60 --> 00:04:17.44 the field and you get to a stream and you can fill your canteens and it's great and
00:04:17.44 --> 00:04:20.24 it seems like you have water forever because it streams.
00:04:20.24 --> 00:04:25.72 Well, the way the patrol went, we started off in pairs and then we linked up with fire
00:04:25.72 --> 00:04:28.56 team and then we linked up with squad and then you look up with a platoon.
00:04:28.56 --> 00:04:34.36 Well while we were in the squad, link up, we, for whatever reason, the course that I was
00:04:34.36 --> 00:04:38.40 on, I didn't hit water, we had a couple of streams that were supposed to be there and
00:04:38.40 --> 00:04:40.84 they weren't because they're intermittent streams.
00:04:40.84 --> 00:04:44.88 So sometimes streams aren't running year round and the time of year it was, the streams
00:04:44.88 --> 00:04:45.88 weren't running.
00:04:45.88 --> 00:04:49.88 So the first one, I was like, okay, okay, got to, so you'll up over a mountain, come
00:04:49.88 --> 00:04:52.96 back down the other side, get to this where the stream is marked intermittent stream
00:04:52.96 --> 00:04:54.44 is marked on a map.
00:04:54.44 --> 00:04:56.40 Guess what, no stream.
00:04:56.40 --> 00:04:59.32 So by that time I was out of water.
00:04:59.32 --> 00:05:04.12 So now coming, the next day, I said to myself, you know, if there's not water on this
00:05:04.12 --> 00:05:09.48 next stream, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have issues and then it wasn't water the next day.
00:05:09.48 --> 00:05:14.64 So yeah, that's, but I started to feel the dehydration coming on me.
00:05:14.64 --> 00:05:16.60 That's why I hate being thirsty.
00:05:16.60 --> 00:05:19.96 I always carry as much water as I can.
00:05:19.96 --> 00:05:21.56 You gotta be paranoid about being thirsty.
00:05:21.56 --> 00:05:25.000 Once you start going down from a dehydration, it's really a bad situation.
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.84 You went the whole day?
00:05:26.84 --> 00:05:27.84 No, it was two days.
00:05:27.84 --> 00:05:32.64 Yeah, I had water going in, but I didn't have a ton of water.
00:05:32.64 --> 00:05:39.48 I should have had one, well, I should have maybe two more meters of water as a, as a just in case.
00:05:39.48 --> 00:05:41.08 But I didn't, I didn't, I didn't carry.
00:05:41.08 --> 00:05:42.52 Yeah, because you gotta carry it.
00:05:42.52 --> 00:05:44.12 Now you're heavier, now you're sweating more.
00:05:44.12 --> 00:05:47.08 So there's a little balance, you gotta figure it out.
00:05:47.08 --> 00:05:49.76 But yeah, you can't be a problem.
00:05:49.76 --> 00:05:53.60 Yes, I have seen it become a problem where guys, egos too big.
00:05:53.60 --> 00:05:54.80 They don't want to admit it for sure.
00:05:54.80 --> 00:05:56.92 So yes, this is a good warning.
00:05:56.92 --> 00:06:00.12 Don't let your ego get you in real trouble because that's gonna hurt your platoon even
00:06:00.12 --> 00:06:01.36 more.
00:06:01.36 --> 00:06:03.08 So don't let that happen.
00:06:03.08 --> 00:06:09.12 Don't let your ego prevent you from telling the truth about what's happening.
00:06:09.12 --> 00:06:13.68 And this happens in, this is gonna happen in the business world too.
00:06:13.68 --> 00:06:15.52 Where, oh, you know what?
00:06:15.52 --> 00:06:18.96 I don't really know how to operate this piece of equipment, but I'm not gonna say anything.
00:06:18.96 --> 00:06:20.24 I'm just gonna try and do it.
00:06:20.24 --> 00:06:21.88 Well, that's how someone gets hurt.
00:06:21.88 --> 00:06:23.52 So again, that's an ego problem.
00:06:23.52 --> 00:06:26.44 When you have an issue, when you know you can't do something or you've never done something
00:06:26.44 --> 00:06:30.72 before, step up and raise your hand.
00:06:30.72 --> 00:06:34.32 Now of course, you should have done the research, you should have, you know, you should have
00:06:34.32 --> 00:06:36.52 figured some stuff out on your own.
00:06:36.52 --> 00:06:40.60 But if you failed to do that, don't dig the whole deeper.
00:06:40.60 --> 00:06:42.80 Raise your hand, say what the problem was.
00:06:42.80 --> 00:06:43.80 There you go.
00:06:43.80 --> 00:06:44.80 Good question.
00:06:44.80 --> 00:06:45.80 Yeah, make sense.
00:06:45.80 --> 00:06:50.36 Because especially the thirst thing, like the dehydration thing, yeah, you don't want
00:06:50.36 --> 00:06:53.28 to be the guy saying, oh, I'm thirst.
00:06:53.28 --> 00:06:58.80 Here's the, I think nowadays though, like teams and coaches, here's the thing in football.
00:06:58.80 --> 00:07:02.08 So pop one or football, they'd be like, yeah, no water.
00:07:02.08 --> 00:07:03.36 You know, we have a water break.
00:07:03.36 --> 00:07:04.56 You drink water at the water break.
00:07:04.56 --> 00:07:05.76 Otherwise you're practicing.
00:07:05.76 --> 00:07:06.44 You know, kind of thing.
00:07:06.44 --> 00:07:07.84 It's like a tough and you're up thing.
00:07:07.84 --> 00:07:10.000 But man, that can jam your health up.
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.44 Yeah, but let's face it.
00:07:11.44 --> 00:07:13.64 I mean, it would be pretty rare.
00:07:13.64 --> 00:07:17.92 If you gave people the, if you're doing a practice, what the how long is a practice last
00:07:17.92 --> 00:07:18.92 two hours?
00:07:18.92 --> 00:07:22.000 Okay, bro, you can make it two hours.
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.84 If you're properly hydrated now, if a person's not properly hydrated, going into the
00:07:25.84 --> 00:07:27.96 practice, sure, that can, that can be a problem.
00:07:27.96 --> 00:07:32.72 But if someone is properly hydrated, going into the situation, it should not be a problem.
00:07:32.72 --> 00:07:36.60 And I'll say what, if you are in the military and you're going in the field, man, pre-hydrate
00:07:36.60 --> 00:07:41.32 like that, you used to save me so much from carrying so much water, just drinks so much
00:07:41.32 --> 00:07:42.32 water.
00:07:42.32 --> 00:07:45.72 Now, take where the problem comes in, you're in a helicopter ride for an hour and a half.
00:07:45.72 --> 00:07:46.72 Yeah.
00:07:46.72 --> 00:07:48.04 And you got to piss so bad.
00:07:48.04 --> 00:07:49.04 Yeah.
00:07:49.04 --> 00:07:50.04 It's awful.
00:07:50.04 --> 00:07:51.92 Well, you know what, bring a little, bring a little plastic bottle with you.
00:07:51.92 --> 00:07:53.16 So you can piss into the bottle.
00:07:53.16 --> 00:07:54.16 That's the way less of an issue.
00:07:54.16 --> 00:07:57.84 I think, like, finding a place to drink versus, for sure.
00:07:57.84 --> 00:07:58.84 It's way to be able to have to.
00:07:58.84 --> 00:08:03.76 But yeah, if you pre-hydrate properly, no matter how hard you're working, you can go
00:08:03.76 --> 00:08:06.24 like 12 hours without any water.
00:08:06.24 --> 00:08:07.64 Which is pretty legit.
00:08:07.64 --> 00:08:11.72 For, you know, kind of an average seal mission, 12 hours, get your brilliant plenty of
00:08:11.72 --> 00:08:12.72 time.
00:08:12.72 --> 00:08:13.72 Yeah.
00:08:13.72 --> 00:08:15.44 But kid, I mean, I'm talking pop warning here.
00:08:15.44 --> 00:08:17.44 So, you know, we're on a no-gjog.
00:08:17.44 --> 00:08:18.44 We're not talking to you.
00:08:18.44 --> 00:08:19.44 We're talking pop warning.
00:08:19.44 --> 00:08:20.44 Yeah.
00:08:20.44 --> 00:08:22.16 But here's the weird thing.
00:08:22.16 --> 00:08:26.60 Like when you went to high school college, they'd have water right there, right there
00:08:26.60 --> 00:08:27.60 on the sideline.
00:08:27.60 --> 00:08:31.24 And they, you know, they're really aware of, hey, you need good, you need water, drink
00:08:31.24 --> 00:08:32.24 more water.
00:08:32.24 --> 00:08:33.24 Well, I think that was also the time.
00:08:33.24 --> 00:08:35.24 Yeah, that's the, actually the point.
00:08:35.24 --> 00:08:37.24 The era, the era, right?
00:08:37.24 --> 00:08:42.60 Like, when we were kids, no one ever, ever, one single time in my whole, from the time
00:08:42.60 --> 00:08:45.96 I was zero until I was 18.
00:08:45.96 --> 00:08:49.12 No one ever said to me, hey, make sure you drink water.
00:08:49.12 --> 00:08:51.12 Never, never heard anyone say that.
00:08:51.12 --> 00:08:53.48 It was like, oh, you're thirsty drink a Coke.
00:08:53.48 --> 00:08:56.16 You know, that's the way it was.
00:08:56.16 --> 00:08:58.40 So that changed for you in that time period.
00:08:58.40 --> 00:08:59.40 Yeah.
00:08:59.40 --> 00:09:03.16 When I got to, when I got to seal training, when I got a buds, that's when they were
00:09:03.16 --> 00:09:06.52 saying, oh, you're going to stay hydrated.
00:09:06.52 --> 00:09:07.52 I thought it was kind of a joke.
00:09:07.52 --> 00:09:08.92 I thought they were getting hit first.
00:09:08.92 --> 00:09:09.92 Yeah, nuts.
00:09:09.92 --> 00:09:11.72 Like, what do you tell them about hydrogen, you mean drink water?
00:09:11.72 --> 00:09:12.72 What do you mean?
00:09:12.72 --> 00:09:13.92 Why would you call it something else?
00:09:13.92 --> 00:09:14.92 Hydrated.
00:09:14.92 --> 00:09:15.92 Yeah.
00:09:15.92 --> 00:09:16.92 What are your thirst ever?
00:09:16.92 --> 00:09:17.92 Yeah.
00:09:17.92 --> 00:09:20.12 Like, it's like this mate, will you shut?
00:09:20.12 --> 00:09:24.20 Because you can go down from like heat, kid, this like for there's heat exhaustion.
00:09:24.20 --> 00:09:25.20 Heat stroke, heat exhaustion.
00:09:25.20 --> 00:09:26.20 Yeah.
00:09:26.20 --> 00:09:27.20 And heat.
00:09:27.20 --> 00:09:28.20 There's all kinds of heat injuries you can get.
00:09:28.20 --> 00:09:29.20 Yeah.
00:09:29.20 --> 00:09:30.56 And you get heat stroke, but you can straight up die.
00:09:30.56 --> 00:09:31.56 Oh, yeah.
00:09:31.56 --> 00:09:34.60 So that's not, you know, it's not a matter of like, oh, yeah, tough it out.
00:09:34.60 --> 00:09:35.76 But you can't tough it out.
00:09:35.76 --> 00:09:36.76 You're shutting down.
00:09:36.76 --> 00:09:37.76 Kind of big.
00:09:37.76 --> 00:09:38.76 That's for sure.
00:09:38.76 --> 00:09:39.76 So, you know, that is important.
00:09:39.76 --> 00:09:40.76 It's for the heat thing.
00:09:40.76 --> 00:09:41.76 And I guess that is.
00:09:41.76 --> 00:09:42.76 That is.
00:09:42.76 --> 00:09:44.52 And that's going back to this question.
00:09:44.52 --> 00:09:50.76 That is probably why we would see heat casualties in training because guys do not want
00:09:50.76 --> 00:09:51.76 to say anything.
00:09:51.76 --> 00:09:52.76 They're like man, I'm not going to say anything.
00:09:52.76 --> 00:09:53.76 Yeah.
00:09:53.76 --> 00:09:54.76 I'm not going to get it now.
00:09:54.76 --> 00:09:55.76 Keep it worse.
00:09:55.76 --> 00:09:56.76 That's what happened.
00:09:56.76 --> 00:09:58.76 You could stuck with an IV now you're laying in the field.
00:09:58.76 --> 00:10:03.52 Everyone else, by the way, continues on doing another 10 kilometer hump to a target.
00:10:03.52 --> 00:10:07.16 And you're sitting there laid up in the ambulance like a little baby.
00:10:07.16 --> 00:10:09.000 No one wants that.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.12 But if you pre-high-pre-high-pre-high-pre-prop, you won't be in that situation.
00:10:12.12 --> 00:10:13.12 Yeah.
00:10:13.12 --> 00:10:16.52 But if you are going to get that situation, you need to say something.
00:10:16.52 --> 00:10:17.52 Yeah.
00:10:17.52 --> 00:10:19.40 We're talking about your life.
00:10:19.40 --> 00:10:20.40 Yeah.
00:10:20.40 --> 00:10:21.40 Essentially.
00:10:21.40 --> 00:10:22.40 And more important.
00:10:22.40 --> 00:10:23.40 We're talking about the mission.
00:10:23.40 --> 00:10:24.40 Yeah.
00:10:24.40 --> 00:10:27.000 I'm still thinking about the potworn of situation.
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000 Yeah, man.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.64 I dig it and you are correct.
00:10:29.64 --> 00:10:30.64 I can't help it.
00:10:30.64 --> 00:10:33.40 I agree with you 100%.
00:10:33.40 --> 00:10:34.40 That question.
00:10:34.40 --> 00:10:35.40 Jockel.
00:10:35.40 --> 00:10:37.32 Dear Jockel.
00:10:37.32 --> 00:10:43.16 My chosen community has lost and continues to lose members due to suicide.
00:10:43.16 --> 00:10:46.36 One reason is that they don't ask for help.
00:10:46.36 --> 00:10:51.84 I think one reason they don't ask for help is that they're afraid of being or being seen
00:10:51.84 --> 00:10:53.84 as weak.
00:10:53.84 --> 00:10:59.16 Somewhere that this takes strength and discipline to be able to perceive when you need help
00:10:59.16 --> 00:11:00.56 and to ask for it.
00:11:00.56 --> 00:11:03.36 I don't know how to convey that to them.
00:11:03.36 --> 00:11:07.56 Could you address how one can gather support from their team without losing face?
00:11:07.56 --> 00:11:11.20 So there's an obvious reason why I paired these two questions together because they're both
00:11:11.20 --> 00:11:13.52 very, very similar.
00:11:13.52 --> 00:11:15.84 And it's the same thing.
00:11:15.84 --> 00:11:20.88 And if we don't, if a member of your team won't come forward and admit they haven't
00:11:20.88 --> 00:11:23.76 issued, then the issue is not going to get addressed.
00:11:23.76 --> 00:11:26.36 And this is the same exact thing they have to explain to your team.
00:11:26.36 --> 00:11:31.72 Like, hey, if you start going down because you're dehydrated or you're starting getting
00:11:31.72 --> 00:11:37.36 getting frostbite and you need to get warmed up, you need to say something.
00:11:37.36 --> 00:11:40.84 If you don't say something, that's going to hurt the whole team.
00:11:40.84 --> 00:11:42.40 That's what's bad.
00:11:42.40 --> 00:11:44.20 So I think that's important.
00:11:44.20 --> 00:11:48.96 I think that's important to make sure everyone understands that this part of being a good
00:11:48.96 --> 00:11:54.000 operator is knowing your limitations and when you reach your limitations, raising your hand
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.28 and saying, hey, this is a problem.
00:11:57.28 --> 00:12:03.32 And believe me, there's guys that might complain about little things and they're eventually
00:12:03.32 --> 00:12:06.64 going to be labeled as a little complainer, right?
00:12:06.64 --> 00:12:08.68 And they don't really have issues.
00:12:08.68 --> 00:12:10.76 So there's a fine line, right?
00:12:10.76 --> 00:12:12.36 There's a fine line.
00:12:12.36 --> 00:12:20.08 But for someone that's having some kind of mental stress, well, again, we got to recognize
00:12:20.08 --> 00:12:21.08 what's going on.
00:12:21.08 --> 00:12:24.12 We got to recognize that it's impacting us negatively at work.
00:12:24.12 --> 00:12:25.32 So that means you got to raise your hand.
00:12:25.32 --> 00:12:28.16 If it's having a negative impact on the way you're performing, then you got to raise your
00:12:28.16 --> 00:12:29.16 hand.
00:12:29.16 --> 00:12:35.60 And I think it's important to explain to people that this is something that happens to
00:12:35.60 --> 00:12:37.60 can happen to everybody.
00:12:37.60 --> 00:12:39.08 And it's not a negative thing.
00:12:39.08 --> 00:12:40.68 It's just a reality.
00:12:40.68 --> 00:12:44.60 It's kind of like it reminds me of being afraid, right?
00:12:44.60 --> 00:12:51.16 And if you're, let's say you got a new guy that's never done anything before and he doesn't
00:12:51.16 --> 00:12:56.36 know that he's going to be afraid, going on an operation, then he's going to wonder why
00:12:56.36 --> 00:13:00.92 a stomach is upset or why he's second guess himself or why he can't sleep.
00:13:00.92 --> 00:13:02.76 Like, oh, you can't sleep.
00:13:02.76 --> 00:13:03.76 Guess what?
00:13:03.76 --> 00:13:04.76 That's normal.
00:13:04.76 --> 00:13:07.76 You're going on a hardcore combat operation tomorrow.
00:13:07.76 --> 00:13:11.04 The fact that you can't sleep is completely normal. The fact that you feel sick, your stomach
00:13:11.04 --> 00:13:12.16 is completely normal.
00:13:12.16 --> 00:13:14.52 The fact that you're, you're, you're shaking.
00:13:14.52 --> 00:13:15.52 Those things are normal.
00:13:15.52 --> 00:13:16.52 Like, you're going to feel those.
00:13:16.52 --> 00:13:17.52 That's okay.
00:13:17.52 --> 00:13:19.48 It's not that big of a deal.
00:13:19.48 --> 00:13:21.04 And those things are just fear.
00:13:21.04 --> 00:13:22.52 That's what they are.
00:13:22.52 --> 00:13:28.20 And if you know what they are and you know that fear is okay and it's acceptable and it's
00:13:28.20 --> 00:13:30.32 actually kind of good, right?
00:13:30.32 --> 00:13:36.76 Because if, if you're not feeling any fear whatsoever, then you know, you've got some, well,
00:13:36.76 --> 00:13:38.20 you should be feeling afraid.
00:13:38.20 --> 00:13:39.48 You should feel fear.
00:13:39.48 --> 00:13:40.84 That should, that should propel you.
00:13:40.84 --> 00:13:42.48 It should get you on edge.
00:13:42.48 --> 00:13:44.88 Those are all those things are actually happening for a reason.
00:13:44.88 --> 00:13:47.08 So there's nothing wrong with that.
00:13:47.08 --> 00:13:50.28 And I think that's the same thing that you got to explain to people with stress.
00:13:50.28 --> 00:13:53.04 Like, oh, okay, that you can have too much fear.
00:13:53.04 --> 00:13:57.000 You keep someone at that heightened state for an extended period of time.
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.28 Well, that's called combat stress and it's real and it can happen.
00:14:01.28 --> 00:14:02.28 It can happen anyone.
00:14:02.28 --> 00:14:03.28 And you know what?
00:14:03.28 --> 00:14:08.52 Because if we talked about on this podcast where you can see stress, combat stress taking
00:14:08.52 --> 00:14:10.08 it's toll on people.
00:14:10.08 --> 00:14:15.12 And when it does, you know, we've talked about it many times.
00:14:15.12 --> 00:14:20.88 If you get to that point, you need a break and dick winners from Banda Brothers.
00:14:20.88 --> 00:14:24.60 You know, he would give those guys breaks without them even knowing that he was given
00:14:24.60 --> 00:14:25.60 a break.
00:14:25.60 --> 00:14:28.64 Hey, echo, you got to go back and do a little logistics run for four days.
00:14:28.64 --> 00:14:30.92 Just make sure we have more supplies coming away.
00:14:30.92 --> 00:14:33.24 Get you off the front line, get you a breather.
00:14:33.24 --> 00:14:38.56 So that way, again, the same metaphor I've used before is if you have an engine in the
00:14:38.56 --> 00:14:41.000 red and you keep running it, what's going to happen in the engine?
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000 It's going to burn out.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000 It's not going to be usable.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.32 If you have someone that's psychologically stressed and they're in the red and you keep
00:14:46.32 --> 00:14:47.64 running them in the red, guess what?
00:14:47.64 --> 00:14:49.08 Eventually they're not going to be usable anymore.
00:14:49.08 --> 00:14:51.60 So you need to give them a break, get them off the line.
00:14:51.60 --> 00:14:55.32 Because if you do take an engine, if you're engine like check engine like comes on and you
00:14:55.32 --> 00:14:58.92 go and get it maintained, get it fixed, the engine's still good.
00:14:58.92 --> 00:15:00.92 If you keep running it, the engine will be destroyed.
00:15:00.92 --> 00:15:02.32 So you got to do that with your people.
00:15:02.32 --> 00:15:06.04 You got to make sure everybody knows and I think that's a real simple metaphor to use
00:15:06.04 --> 00:15:07.04 with people as well.
00:15:07.04 --> 00:15:11.64 Say, look, we're running hard and we're going to put some stress on the engine.
00:15:11.64 --> 00:15:14.28 And if you don't keep the engine maintained, the engine's going to break and you won't
00:15:14.28 --> 00:15:15.28 be any good to the team.
00:15:15.28 --> 00:15:16.92 You won't be any good for the mission.
00:15:16.92 --> 00:15:21.72 So if you start feeling your engine like go on, you got to let someone know so we can
00:15:21.72 --> 00:15:23.52 give you the proper maintenance.
00:15:23.52 --> 00:15:24.52 And that's it.
00:15:24.52 --> 00:15:25.52 Jody Middick talked about that too.
00:15:25.52 --> 00:15:32.28 Jody was saying, hey, you know, basically if you get injured, if you break your ankle,
00:15:32.28 --> 00:15:34.68 they don't just expect you just to keep going.
00:15:34.68 --> 00:15:38.44 No, like, okay, you need to get back and you need to rehab while the same thing can happen
00:15:38.44 --> 00:15:39.44 to your brain.
00:15:39.44 --> 00:15:41.56 Your brain gets a break in it.
00:15:41.56 --> 00:15:44.48 You don't just keep driving or it's going to fracture a fall apart.
00:15:44.48 --> 00:15:45.48 What do you do?
00:15:45.48 --> 00:15:46.72 You take a break.
00:15:46.72 --> 00:15:53.20 You get down time and you get recovered and then you'll be ready to rock and roll again.
00:15:53.20 --> 00:15:56.04 So two really good questions to start it off.
00:15:56.04 --> 00:15:59.04 You know, again, especially for folks out there on the battlefield.
00:15:59.04 --> 00:16:04.12 And then it's not just for people on the battlefield because it happens with any group of
00:16:04.12 --> 00:16:05.72 people that are in a stressful environment.
00:16:05.72 --> 00:16:10.28 I mean, obviously cops get put into a really stressful environment all the time.
00:16:10.28 --> 00:16:14.88 Well, if you need to take a breather, you need to say something before you, before you
00:16:14.88 --> 00:16:15.96 burn out the engine.
00:16:15.96 --> 00:16:16.96 Yeah.
00:16:16.96 --> 00:16:18.76 Same thing with business world, right?
00:16:18.76 --> 00:16:21.12 People in the business world get extremely stressed out.
00:16:21.12 --> 00:16:23.96 Well, you probably need to break at some point.
00:16:23.96 --> 00:16:26.24 Make sure you work that in there.
00:16:26.24 --> 00:16:34.76 You don't like, like, police have like a mandatory program or mandatory situation where,
00:16:34.76 --> 00:16:37.44 you know, you go through, I think we're like, when they shoot someone or something like
00:16:37.44 --> 00:16:40.76 that, like mandatory, you have to go to like some kind of like counseling.
00:16:40.76 --> 00:16:42.76 Yeah, most of them do now or yeah.
00:16:42.76 --> 00:16:43.76 Yeah.
00:16:43.76 --> 00:16:49.68 So that makes sense too because even if let's say you don't necessarily need it or whatever,
00:16:49.68 --> 00:16:52.68 right, you go through a shooting situation, you got to go a mandatory and then, oh,
00:16:52.68 --> 00:16:53.68 I got to go through it.
00:16:53.68 --> 00:16:59.32 It's good that everyone kind of does it because it seems like, oh, it takes away the negative
00:16:59.32 --> 00:17:03.12 this deep, you know, like, kind of like, oh, I'm the only guy.
00:17:03.12 --> 00:17:05.48 You know, I'm the only guy that apparently feels this way.
00:17:05.48 --> 00:17:06.48 I'm looking around.
00:17:06.48 --> 00:17:07.92 No one else is going to counseling.
00:17:07.92 --> 00:17:08.92 Yeah.
00:17:08.92 --> 00:17:09.92 And now I'm the only guy.
00:17:09.92 --> 00:17:10.92 I must be the weak guy.
00:17:10.92 --> 00:17:11.92 So I don't, I'm not saying that.
00:17:11.92 --> 00:17:15.28 Yeah, they've done that somewhat in the military of, hey, when you come home from the
00:17:15.28 --> 00:17:21.32 planet, everyone's going to go talk to talk to, what is it a psychotherapy or something?
00:17:21.32 --> 00:17:22.32 Yeah.
00:17:22.32 --> 00:17:24.20 Just they kind of do that.
00:17:24.20 --> 00:17:28.28 I know they did that in the school teams where they'd be everyone would go, they didn't
00:17:28.28 --> 00:17:29.28 do all I was in.
00:17:29.28 --> 00:17:33.36 They'd give it, you like a piece of paper to fill out, which everyone just got in a gun
00:17:33.36 --> 00:17:34.36 decked.
00:17:34.36 --> 00:17:36.88 You know, what does that mean?
00:17:36.88 --> 00:17:37.88 Yeah.
00:17:37.88 --> 00:17:38.88 Just pencil whip.
00:17:38.88 --> 00:17:39.88 I don't know what, I don't know.
00:17:39.88 --> 00:17:42.48 It just like, you know, fill it out except for Tony.
00:17:42.48 --> 00:17:45.20 You know, Tony wrote on the head of his, what?
00:17:45.20 --> 00:17:47.68 He wrote, this is a cry for help.
00:17:47.68 --> 00:17:51.92 That was pretty funny.
00:17:51.92 --> 00:17:56.12 But anyways, that was, he filled out like a whole fake one about just a funny one.
00:17:56.12 --> 00:17:57.12 Yeah.
00:17:57.12 --> 00:17:58.12 Dang.
00:17:58.12 --> 00:17:59.60 I got a fake out of it.
00:17:59.60 --> 00:18:00.60 Yeah.
00:18:00.60 --> 00:18:02.64 But it makes sense, though, because of that.
00:18:02.64 --> 00:18:05.60 Because that's kind of the, that's really the most important way to do things.
00:18:05.60 --> 00:18:06.60 It's the smart way to do things.
00:18:06.60 --> 00:18:10.88 Let's give everyone a baseline sort of, okay, check.
00:18:10.88 --> 00:18:11.88 Here you go.
00:18:11.88 --> 00:18:12.88 Yeah.
00:18:12.88 --> 00:18:14.68 And that way, no one has to go.
00:18:14.68 --> 00:18:16.60 No one has to take raise their hand first.
00:18:16.60 --> 00:18:17.60 Yeah.
00:18:17.60 --> 00:18:18.60 You're all going to talk to somebody.
00:18:18.60 --> 00:18:19.60 I think it's a smart thing to do.
00:18:19.60 --> 00:18:20.60 Yeah.
00:18:20.60 --> 00:18:21.60 Yeah.
00:18:21.60 --> 00:18:23.16 Because it's kind of the thing, right?
00:18:23.16 --> 00:18:25.56 It kind of goes along with the earlier question too.
00:18:25.56 --> 00:18:30.24 Like, if it's a water break and hey, guys, water break, everyone's drinking water.
00:18:30.24 --> 00:18:37.24 So now it's like, you don't have to feel like, the one plus who like needs this water.
00:18:37.24 --> 00:18:38.24 Oh, yeah.
00:18:38.24 --> 00:18:39.24 Yeah.
00:18:39.24 --> 00:18:40.24 Oh, yeah.
00:18:40.24 --> 00:18:41.24 No, no.
00:18:41.24 --> 00:18:42.24 That's the exact same thing.
00:18:42.24 --> 00:18:43.24 Yeah.
00:18:43.24 --> 00:18:44.24 So yeah.
00:18:44.24 --> 00:18:46.12 If you got an issue man, speak up.
00:18:46.12 --> 00:18:49.08 Everyone knows, you know, that way you can do your job.
00:18:49.08 --> 00:18:50.08 You can do it longer.
00:18:50.08 --> 00:18:51.08 You can do it better.
00:18:51.08 --> 00:18:57.56 Your goal is to do the, is to be the best possible that you, be the best possible capability
00:18:57.56 --> 00:19:00.08 so that you can go out and do your job the best.
00:19:00.08 --> 00:19:03.88 If you've, if you've got issues, you've got to say something so that you can keep doing
00:19:03.88 --> 00:19:05.36 your job for the team.
00:19:05.36 --> 00:19:06.36 Yeah.
00:19:06.36 --> 00:19:10.16 It's like, like, don't look at yourself as being weak.
00:19:10.16 --> 00:19:13.36 Look at yourself is trying to optimize your strength kind of go.
00:19:13.36 --> 00:19:16.56 You know, maybe just a flip over the way you look at it.
00:19:16.56 --> 00:19:17.88 There it is.
00:19:17.88 --> 00:19:18.88 Next question.
00:19:18.88 --> 00:19:23.72 Do you think martial arts tournaments are the most effective way for preparing for
00:19:23.72 --> 00:19:25.36 physical confrontation?
00:19:25.36 --> 00:19:31.24 I just competed my second due to tournament as a three straight white belt.
00:19:31.24 --> 00:19:36.60 In one match, I completely lost focus and control of my mind because I believe I was taken
00:19:36.60 --> 00:19:43.08 a back by the strength and wildness of my opponent in a big 100%.
00:19:43.08 --> 00:19:47.84 I barely, I can barely even remember how the match unfolded.
00:19:47.84 --> 00:19:52.000 I've given this match significant thought and I concluded that I need to compete more.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.88 I'm very comfortable with everyone in my academy.
00:19:55.88 --> 00:19:59.48 I trust that as I roll with without question, they're like family now.
00:19:59.48 --> 00:20:03.16 The guy, the guy in the tournament was a total stranger.
00:20:03.16 --> 00:20:06.08 He was unknown and therefore he listed fear.
00:20:06.08 --> 00:20:09.88 I allowed myself to be crippled by fear.
00:20:09.88 --> 00:20:13.40 Is there any other way to overcome this beyond competing tournaments?
00:20:13.40 --> 00:20:14.40 Thank you.
00:20:14.40 --> 00:20:17.40 All right.
00:20:17.40 --> 00:20:21.04 You know, competing is definitely part of it.
00:20:21.04 --> 00:20:25.40 And it's interesting that he's asking if this is the most effective way to prepare for
00:20:25.40 --> 00:20:27.88 a physical confrontation.
00:20:27.88 --> 00:20:34.12 It is a very good way to help you prepare for a physical confrontation.
00:20:34.12 --> 00:20:35.52 And the bottom line is competing.
00:20:35.52 --> 00:20:41.88 One of the things that's true with competing and it's true with anything is that the
00:20:41.88 --> 00:20:48.68 more familiar you are with the unfamiliar, the more familiar it will become.
00:20:48.68 --> 00:20:53.64 I know that sounds pretty obvious, but the more familiar you are with the unfamiliar, the
00:20:53.64 --> 00:20:55.44 more familiar it will become.
00:20:55.44 --> 00:20:58.56 So you get to become familiar with things that are unfamiliar.
00:20:58.56 --> 00:21:03.08 And you learn how to handle things that you aren't expecting.
00:21:03.08 --> 00:21:08.56 In the teams, we always talk about your first free fall jump when you learn how to skydive
00:21:08.56 --> 00:21:10.68 with the free fall rig.
00:21:10.68 --> 00:21:15.12 And your first jump seems like it's like three seconds long, even though it's a minute.
00:21:15.12 --> 00:21:18.60 Even though it's a minute because you're all amped up and you all you see is your
00:21:18.60 --> 00:21:22.12 altimeter and the more you jump the more you see.
00:21:22.12 --> 00:21:26.16 Until that minute, I mean, have you ever tried to hold your breath for a minute?
00:21:26.16 --> 00:21:28.84 That's like a long time, right?
00:21:28.84 --> 00:21:33.92 But and that's that's the amount of time that can take up a free fall can be a nice
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:36.32 long minute where you're observing all these different things.
00:21:36.32 --> 00:21:39.20 But when you first start doing it, it doesn't seem very long.
00:21:39.20 --> 00:21:45.08 I'm sure if we had Andy, Andy Stumpfon here, his one minute free fall price seems like
00:21:45.08 --> 00:21:50.44 a really, really long time because he's got thousands of of jumps.
00:21:50.44 --> 00:21:59.84 And so this is the same thing, the more you train for chaos, the more accustomed you're
00:21:59.84 --> 00:22:01.84 going to become to the chaos.
00:22:01.84 --> 00:22:05.80 Now what's great is in this particular case, he's talking about this guy's just wild and
00:22:05.80 --> 00:22:10.04 crazy and hey, if you survive it that first time, well, the next time someone goes wild
00:22:10.04 --> 00:22:12.08 and crazy, like, okay, well, here's what I need to do.
00:22:12.08 --> 00:22:13.36 I need to put this in check.
00:22:13.36 --> 00:22:14.36 I need to hold on.
00:22:14.36 --> 00:22:17.64 I need to make sure he, I don't give any positions, but I'm not going to get crazy.
00:22:17.64 --> 00:22:22.80 I'm just going to absorb some, you go through that mental drill and the more you go through
00:22:22.80 --> 00:22:26.000 that mental drill, the better you will get at it.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000 And this is true.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.44 This is true with anything.
00:22:28.44 --> 00:22:32.60 And that's why, you know, when I was running the sales training, we put the, we would
00:22:32.60 --> 00:22:34.08 make it.
00:22:34.08 --> 00:22:37.92 So we'd hit people with the most random possible things because that's what prepares you
00:22:37.92 --> 00:22:40.40 for random possible things is random possible things.
00:22:40.40 --> 00:22:42.08 That's what you want to deal with.
00:22:42.08 --> 00:22:46.72 It's kind of weird, you know, in Gjitsu, Dean, Dean, you used to talk about this.
00:22:46.72 --> 00:22:49.44 And now you can hear John Donner talking about it as well.
00:22:49.44 --> 00:22:56.88 And if, if you have never been in a certain situation before, you're not ready for it.
00:22:56.88 --> 00:23:02.88 And when, okay, so there's a, there's a position in, in Gjitsu called 5050, right?
00:23:02.88 --> 00:23:04.56 That's what it's called now.
00:23:04.56 --> 00:23:09.28 We used to call it Kakaraco because that's the position that Dean was in when he beat
00:23:09.28 --> 00:23:13.48 a guy named Kakaraco for the ADCC, World Championships.
00:23:13.48 --> 00:23:20.92 And Dean, Dean calls that position 9010 because he's been in it so much that even though
00:23:20.92 --> 00:23:25.56 it's a neutral position, meaning we both have the same advantages and disadvantages.
00:23:25.56 --> 00:23:29.04 When Dean's in that position, he's been in it so much that he's got a 90% chance.
00:23:29.04 --> 00:23:34.24 He's got a 90% chance to success because he's been there 10 times, 20 times, 30 times
00:23:34.24 --> 00:23:35.24 more than you.
00:23:35.24 --> 00:23:38.44 And I heard John Donner talking about the same thing the other day.
00:23:38.44 --> 00:23:45.56 He's getting his, his Gjitsu fighters right now are doing things to guys that are, that
00:23:45.56 --> 00:23:48.40 they're putting people in positions that the person's not used to.
00:23:48.40 --> 00:23:49.84 So if you're not used to it, guess what?
00:23:49.84 --> 00:23:52.72 You're an advantage, even though I might have trained, even though let's say I'm a Gjitsu
00:23:52.72 --> 00:23:54.20 Black belt.
00:23:54.20 --> 00:23:56.04 And I've been training for 20 years.
00:23:56.04 --> 00:24:01.96 If I've never been in this particular position before, it's, I might as well be a white belt
00:24:01.96 --> 00:24:02.96 mechanism.
00:24:02.96 --> 00:24:04.12 You can see that happening.
00:24:04.12 --> 00:24:05.68 You can see that happening in Gjitsu.
00:24:05.68 --> 00:24:11.44 That's why when somebody comes up with a new, new type of moves, that move can be effective
00:24:11.44 --> 00:24:12.44 for a little while.
00:24:12.44 --> 00:24:14.32 Like let's say you came up with a new move.
00:24:14.32 --> 00:24:16.88 You might catch me in that new move one time.
00:24:16.88 --> 00:24:18.92 And then I go, I know what he did.
00:24:18.92 --> 00:24:24.04 But now, if instead of just a new move, you had a whole new area that I had to learn.
00:24:24.04 --> 00:24:26.44 Yeah, then I had to learn a whole new deal.
00:24:26.44 --> 00:24:29.60 It's the same thing with Eddie Bravo and 10th planet.
00:24:29.60 --> 00:24:33.44 You know, like they were doing things like, oh, I've never been in this position before.
00:24:33.44 --> 00:24:35.24 Now what do I do?
00:24:35.24 --> 00:24:37.32 They were catching guys like that.
00:24:37.32 --> 00:24:40.72 And then the more people figure out that part of that system.
00:24:40.72 --> 00:24:44.000 Okay, well, then you get better at it and we get to a neutral ground again.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.44 But anytime you can, so in training, anytime you can get to be put yourself in a situation
00:24:49.44 --> 00:24:52.12 that you haven't been before, it's going to be beneficial to you.
00:24:52.12 --> 00:24:56.56 Now what is, how does this translate to real physical confrontations?
00:24:56.56 --> 00:24:57.56 Right?
00:24:57.56 --> 00:24:58.96 How do you train for that?
00:24:58.96 --> 00:25:01.96 Well, how often are you putting on gloves and Gjitsu?
00:25:01.96 --> 00:25:03.96 How often are you having somebody punch you in the face?
00:25:03.96 --> 00:25:07.52 How often are you having somebody come up and push you around?
00:25:07.52 --> 00:25:11.60 How often are you having people do things that people can do in a street fight?
00:25:11.60 --> 00:25:12.60 Right?
00:25:12.60 --> 00:25:15.88 People are going to do in a street fight that they wouldn't normally do in a Gjitsu match.
00:25:15.88 --> 00:25:16.88 Right?
00:25:16.88 --> 00:25:20.28 For instance, in a street fight is anyone ever start on the knees?
00:25:20.28 --> 00:25:21.28 Right?
00:25:21.28 --> 00:25:22.28 They don't start on the knees.
00:25:22.28 --> 00:25:24.92 They don't start on the knees and street fight.
00:25:24.92 --> 00:25:27.88 You don't say, hey, you want to fight me and then you didn't get down on your knees.
00:25:27.88 --> 00:25:28.88 And so does the other guy.
00:25:28.88 --> 00:25:29.88 Now we figure out what happens.
00:25:29.88 --> 00:25:32.76 No, street fights don't start on the knees.
00:25:32.76 --> 00:25:37.68 So you're almost, and people ask me this, actually somebody asks me the other day, what
00:25:37.68 --> 00:25:39.24 should I do when starting from the knees?
00:25:39.24 --> 00:25:40.24 What's a good take down?
00:25:40.24 --> 00:25:41.60 I'm like, oh, my God, pull guard.
00:25:41.60 --> 00:25:43.000 Because why are you on your knees?
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.72 The best thing to do if your opponent is on their knees, stand up and kick them in the
00:25:45.72 --> 00:25:46.72 face.
00:25:46.72 --> 00:25:47.72 Right?
00:25:47.72 --> 00:25:51.92 You're not going to be, why would you be on your knees?
00:25:51.92 --> 00:25:53.08 Yeah.
00:25:53.08 --> 00:25:54.68 So don't practice that.
00:25:54.68 --> 00:26:00.92 So how do you prepare for the best way to prepare for these combat situations is, is
00:26:00.92 --> 00:26:02.20 Gjitsu tournament a good way?
00:26:02.20 --> 00:26:03.36 Yes, it is a good way.
00:26:03.36 --> 00:26:06.32 Is boxing is boxing a good way?
00:26:06.32 --> 00:26:07.72 Is it good to do a smokers?
00:26:07.72 --> 00:26:10.84 So you figure out what it's like when somebody, you want to talk about someone going
00:26:10.84 --> 00:26:12.32 wild with you.
00:26:12.32 --> 00:26:16.28 You get someone that's untrained in boxing come thrown, thrown, you know, windmill
00:26:16.28 --> 00:26:18.52 hammakers at you, 38 in a row.
00:26:18.52 --> 00:26:22.28 Now they're going to be exhausted after that first 32 seconds.
00:26:22.28 --> 00:26:28.08 But you will have had to have withstand and not get punched in the head.
00:26:28.08 --> 00:26:29.08 Yeah.
00:26:29.08 --> 00:26:31.44 Because if you get punched in the head by a wild hammaker, I don't care who you are.
00:26:31.44 --> 00:26:34.92 If they connect with your chin, there's a possibility you might go down.
00:26:34.92 --> 00:26:36.60 So you need to be careful that.
00:26:36.60 --> 00:26:41.92 So don't just think, oh, just Gjitsu, hey, go out, train some boxing, train some
00:26:41.92 --> 00:26:44.88 moitai and go in sparr.
00:26:44.88 --> 00:26:51.08 And if you can do a smokers because smokers pretty easy to do, in other words, you don't
00:26:51.08 --> 00:26:56.76 need to do like a full preparation camp and all that.
00:26:56.76 --> 00:26:57.76 Yeah.
00:26:57.76 --> 00:26:59.16 It's an unofficial event.
00:26:59.16 --> 00:27:03.72 So you go do a smokers and you're going to experience somebody going wild on you, throwing
00:27:03.72 --> 00:27:06.88 haymakers at you, throwing crazy kicks at you.
00:27:06.88 --> 00:27:11.24 Do that, do all these things to get ready for those physical competitions.
00:27:11.24 --> 00:27:16.000 And then you also on top of that, you read and you look at YouTube videos.
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000 Go watch YouTube.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000 I've talked about this before.
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.20 Go watch YouTube videos and street fights because you get to see what people, what
00:27:21.20 --> 00:27:26.52 kind of things people do, which can be very effective.
00:27:26.52 --> 00:27:27.52 Right?
00:27:27.52 --> 00:27:28.92 So learn to watch out for soccer punches.
00:27:28.92 --> 00:27:32.56 You need to learn to watch out, watch your back and watch your sneaking up on you and
00:27:32.56 --> 00:27:34.76 be aware of your surroundings and put your back against the wall.
00:27:34.76 --> 00:27:37.000 You know, there's all these little things that you can do to make sure that you're not
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.60 going to get soccer punched.
00:27:39.60 --> 00:27:41.44 But you got to pay attention to those things.
00:27:41.44 --> 00:27:42.44 Yeah.
00:27:42.44 --> 00:27:43.44 Yeah.
00:27:43.44 --> 00:27:46.44 That wildness that he talks about.
00:27:46.44 --> 00:27:47.44 Yeah.
00:27:47.44 --> 00:27:49.92 That is a huge thing.
00:27:49.92 --> 00:27:56.52 It's like a whole another factor, especially in exactly how he said he's real, he's real familiar
00:27:56.52 --> 00:27:58.20 with his training partners.
00:27:58.20 --> 00:28:02.32 So man, you know, the amount of cruising and kind of relax and even during the role,
00:28:02.32 --> 00:28:06.000 there's probably significant amount of it almost to the point where it seems like anyway
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.52 where he kind of maybe expects that or even subconsciously kind of he understands that
00:28:11.52 --> 00:28:13.000 that's kind of part of the deal.
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.04 You go against a complete stranger and he gets wild.
00:28:17.04 --> 00:28:20.12 And it's like, whoa, this is like, it's kind of overwhelming.
00:28:20.12 --> 00:28:21.12 Yeah.
00:28:21.12 --> 00:28:26.48 And also, even at the three stripe white belt level, this other guy,
00:28:26.48 --> 00:28:29.20 he may, he's got his little game.
00:28:29.20 --> 00:28:31.44 He's got his game that he plays.
00:28:31.44 --> 00:28:35.000 And there's a chance that as a three stripe white belt, you haven't learned that part
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000 of the game.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.40 So it just feels crazy.
00:28:37.40 --> 00:28:38.40 Yeah.
00:28:38.40 --> 00:28:42.08 And that whole, you know, when you compete for the first second time, you know, just a
00:28:42.08 --> 00:28:43.08 little earlier.
00:28:43.08 --> 00:28:47.48 See, that as the thing is, the more you train, the less holes there are.
00:28:47.48 --> 00:28:48.48 Yeah.
00:28:48.48 --> 00:28:49.48 Right.
00:28:49.48 --> 00:28:50.48 The less holes you are.
00:28:50.48 --> 00:28:51.48 There are in your game.
00:28:51.48 --> 00:28:56.24 And so if you're a three stripe white belt, you might not have good guard
00:28:56.24 --> 00:28:57.72 replacement, right?
00:28:57.72 --> 00:29:00.68 Like you really haven't learned how to replace the guard from cross side.
00:29:00.68 --> 00:29:01.36 Yeah.
00:29:01.36 --> 00:29:05.32 Well, if this guy happens to be a guy that holds really well across the
00:29:05.32 --> 00:29:06.88 side, and that's where he works his game from.
00:29:06.88 --> 00:29:07.88 Man, you're a big trouble.
00:29:07.88 --> 00:29:08.88 Yeah.
00:29:08.88 --> 00:29:09.88 You're a big trouble.
00:29:09.88 --> 00:29:10.88 Yeah.
00:29:10.88 --> 00:29:14.24 And it all seems so unpredictable too at those earlier stages, because you don't know
00:29:14.24 --> 00:29:15.24 where your holes are.
00:29:15.24 --> 00:29:17.24 I mean, you might know some, but you don't know.
00:29:17.24 --> 00:29:18.24 Yeah.
00:29:18.24 --> 00:29:19.76 You know, you haven't seen enough of the game.
00:29:19.76 --> 00:29:24.56 And you haven't been in enough situations where you can kind of stay calm and, you know,
00:29:24.56 --> 00:29:25.56 all the stuff.
00:29:25.56 --> 00:29:30.20 So to your point where you say you got to be familiar with the unfamiliar kind of thing.
00:29:30.20 --> 00:29:33.84 Remember when Majeed started just baseball bat choking everyone?
00:29:33.84 --> 00:29:34.84 Yeah.
00:29:34.84 --> 00:29:35.84 How was Lea's?
00:29:35.84 --> 00:29:36.84 Yeah.
00:29:36.84 --> 00:29:37.84 He's live weird setups.
00:29:37.84 --> 00:29:40.84 And he would let people pass his guard and then he'd be thinking, oh, I'm about to
00:29:40.84 --> 00:29:43.60 score some points on the and boom, they're getting tapped out.
00:29:43.60 --> 00:29:44.60 Yeah.
00:29:44.60 --> 00:29:48.44 But it was so foreign that, okay.
00:29:48.44 --> 00:29:51.92 So he went the two real, real famous ones at the time when he exploded on the
00:29:51.92 --> 00:29:53.36 scene with these was.
00:29:53.36 --> 00:29:55.72 He was Clark and Zach.
00:29:55.72 --> 00:29:56.72 Yeah.
00:29:56.72 --> 00:30:02.12 Back to the two matches and one of them Zach Maxwell mounted in Armbar.
00:30:02.12 --> 00:30:06.40 No, hasn't been the Armbar meanwhile baseball, but, yeah, choke is in.
00:30:06.40 --> 00:30:07.72 No, but who cares?
00:30:07.72 --> 00:30:11.52 Because really that rule could not, not rule, but that situation up kind of applies.
00:30:11.52 --> 00:30:13.16 If you have someone in Armbar, I don't care.
00:30:13.16 --> 00:30:14.16 You should be.
00:30:14.16 --> 00:30:15.16 Yep.
00:30:15.16 --> 00:30:16.16 I got the armbar to break your arm.
00:30:16.16 --> 00:30:18.92 He's going for the arm, but he can't lean back because the baseball, that
00:30:18.92 --> 00:30:21.28 choke is in and he's like, he got a tap.
00:30:21.28 --> 00:30:22.28 Yeah.
00:30:22.28 --> 00:30:27.08 And then I think he was Clark where he could have been the other way around, but
00:30:27.08 --> 00:30:29.88 either way, Clark has a, was Zach was going to block it.
00:30:29.88 --> 00:30:31.60 I was at these matches, weren't I?
00:30:31.60 --> 00:30:32.60 I know I was.
00:30:32.60 --> 00:30:33.60 Yeah, I wasn't.
00:30:33.60 --> 00:30:34.60 I was there by.
00:30:34.60 --> 00:30:39.24 So the videos, but yeah, the kind where Clark was like, I know this choke, I'm in
00:30:39.24 --> 00:30:40.88 mount or I'm in this good position.
00:30:40.88 --> 00:30:42.80 I know that this choke doesn't work.
00:30:42.80 --> 00:30:46.08 It simply doesn't work because I have the advantage and he gets choked unconscious because
00:30:46.08 --> 00:30:47.08 he doesn't tap.
00:30:47.08 --> 00:30:48.08 Sure, it might hurt.
00:30:48.08 --> 00:30:50.92 And that is the case for a lot of the, a lot of jokes where it's like, sure, this
00:30:50.92 --> 00:30:51.92 hurt.
00:30:51.92 --> 00:30:52.92 It's not a choke.
00:30:52.92 --> 00:30:54.16 No, a good one doesn't even hurt.
00:30:54.16 --> 00:30:55.16 Yeah, it's a good choke.
00:30:55.16 --> 00:30:56.16 It's just in.
00:30:56.16 --> 00:30:57.16 Yeah.
00:30:57.16 --> 00:30:58.96 So what we're talking about there is a guy named Mijid.
00:30:58.96 --> 00:31:00.16 What's Mijid's last name?
00:31:00.16 --> 00:31:01.16 He's.
00:31:01.16 --> 00:31:02.16 Yeah, that's right.
00:31:02.16 --> 00:31:05.36 And he came on to the scene.
00:31:05.36 --> 00:31:06.76 We'll say.
00:31:06.76 --> 00:31:07.76 Sure.
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:11.04 With, well, this is what's interesting about this is the baseball bat choke is not a new
00:31:11.04 --> 00:31:12.04 choke.
00:31:12.04 --> 00:31:14.92 It's not a domain that people were unfamiliar with.
00:31:14.92 --> 00:31:20.24 It's just that he was doing it really, really well with really good setups that people,
00:31:20.24 --> 00:31:22.20 that's what, that's the part that people weren't expecting.
00:31:22.20 --> 00:31:23.56 It was a really good setup.
00:31:23.56 --> 00:31:26.20 They were really good setups of people weren't expecting.
00:31:26.20 --> 00:31:30.64 And so he'd let people pass their guard or his guard.
00:31:30.64 --> 00:31:31.64 But he had the choke in.
00:31:31.64 --> 00:31:33.92 They'd get across side and get mounted or whatever.
00:31:33.92 --> 00:31:39.16 Go for arm locks and they're tapping because they weren't expecting it.
00:31:39.16 --> 00:31:40.16 Yeah.
00:31:40.16 --> 00:31:45.32 And even if those, you know, I mean, Zach Maxwell and Clark Gracie, just phenomenal competitors
00:31:45.32 --> 00:31:50.88 Black belt, I mean, been training their whole lives, both of them got caught by that.
00:31:50.88 --> 00:31:51.88 Yeah, he's.
00:31:51.88 --> 00:31:59.88 Yeah, the legitimacy of like the way that whole thing went down was just so astounding.
00:31:59.88 --> 00:32:02.24 Like just like how you say, like Clark?
00:32:02.24 --> 00:32:03.24 Yeah.
00:32:03.24 --> 00:32:05.84 But Clark has been winning stuff from day one.
00:32:05.84 --> 00:32:06.84 That's when it's in.
00:32:06.84 --> 00:32:07.84 Yeah.
00:32:07.84 --> 00:32:13.08 And yeah, it's just crazy, but it just shows, you know, where you can, you can be that good.
00:32:13.08 --> 00:32:16.16 You get just that one teeny tiny window of familiarity.
00:32:16.16 --> 00:32:18.32 Yeah, that's what they got creeps in there.
00:32:18.32 --> 00:32:20.88 And he's familiar, but he'll just have his way.
00:32:20.88 --> 00:32:25.40 And then what was interesting is as people started knowing that that's what he's going
00:32:25.40 --> 00:32:26.40 to go for.
00:32:26.40 --> 00:32:27.40 But he'd still get it.
00:32:27.40 --> 00:32:28.40 Yeah.
00:32:28.40 --> 00:32:32.68 And actually, and I trained with him before, he had just, you know, a few times or whatever.
00:32:32.68 --> 00:32:35.16 And he didn't do that to me.
00:32:35.16 --> 00:32:38.60 And I was like, hey, you know, like, well, I didn't have some why didn't do it to me.
00:32:38.60 --> 00:32:42.56 But I was like, do people, you know, like, does everyone ask you to teach them or
00:32:42.56 --> 00:32:46.20 do he's like, you know what, people don't, I don't even really talk about anymore because
00:32:46.20 --> 00:32:51.80 I've become so well known for that move that it becomes, it became less a part of my life.
00:32:51.80 --> 00:32:52.80 Yeah.
00:32:52.80 --> 00:32:59.000 It could happen to where, okay, now once you go, okay, it goes through a phase of, hey,
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.96 I wasn't expecting that.
00:33:00.96 --> 00:33:02.36 And it worked because I wasn't expecting it.
00:33:02.36 --> 00:33:06.08 Then it goes like, hey, I was expecting it, but it still worked.
00:33:06.08 --> 00:33:08.44 But then it gets to a point where people are just going, I'm not going to do it.
00:33:08.44 --> 00:33:10.64 Like, oh, if he grabs my collar, I need to go.
00:33:10.64 --> 00:33:14.84 It totally different direction. I need to not do anything, need to back out whatever.
00:33:14.84 --> 00:33:19.84 And then it becomes where, like you said, it's now it's losing some of its effectiveness
00:33:19.84 --> 00:33:23.76 because everyone is expecting that to be the move that you do.
00:33:23.76 --> 00:33:29.04 That's what happened with the 100% like where there'd be like, I don't care what position
00:33:29.04 --> 00:33:31.64 I mean, I don't care what position I have to give up.
00:33:31.64 --> 00:33:34.24 It's just do not get into that leglock position.
00:33:34.24 --> 00:33:37.64 It's like, you could tell with some of his matches, I was like, oh, yeah, she did.
00:33:37.64 --> 00:33:38.64 I get it.
00:33:38.64 --> 00:33:41.64 You know, I get it, but you have that is how it goes.
00:33:41.64 --> 00:33:46.24 But the chaos thing, I think he should compete more.
00:33:46.24 --> 00:33:47.64 Yes, that should compete more.
00:33:47.64 --> 00:33:53.36 For sure. But what I'm saying is compete in Gigiitsu for sure, but do some smokers, do some
00:33:53.36 --> 00:33:59.32 mojitai, do some wrestling matches, do some sombo turn, you know, get out there, do some different
00:33:59.32 --> 00:34:04.64 competitions and then on top of all that, man, do some scenario based training.
00:34:04.64 --> 00:34:10.64 You know, do some self defense based training at the Academy where somebody pulls out the
00:34:10.64 --> 00:34:15.72 the knife, the fake knife, whatever, what do they call the fake knife and like, let's make
00:34:15.72 --> 00:34:17.12 sure we know how to deal with that.
00:34:17.12 --> 00:34:19.12 Let's make sure we know how to deal with the baseball bat.
00:34:19.12 --> 00:34:20.12 Like, what are you going to do?
00:34:20.12 --> 00:34:21.12 What are you going to do?
00:34:21.12 --> 00:34:24.12 Because baseball bat, you know what you do with the baseball bat, close the distance.
00:34:24.12 --> 00:34:25.12 Yeah.
00:34:25.12 --> 00:34:30.48 You know, hey, that's not even really a game changer as long as you know what you're doing.
00:34:30.48 --> 00:34:33.16 Knife, close the distance with a knife and now you're getting stabbed.
00:34:33.16 --> 00:34:34.16 Yes.
00:34:34.16 --> 00:34:36.16 So, you got to make distance.
00:34:36.16 --> 00:34:37.16 Yeah.
00:34:37.16 --> 00:34:41.72 And again, man, that just that familiarity, like, once you go through it, that's like almost
00:34:41.72 --> 00:34:43.40 night and day and end of itself.
00:34:43.40 --> 00:34:47.12 Once you've seen it, if you've never seen it, if you've seen it once, like, that first
00:34:47.12 --> 00:34:48.12 step is night and day.
00:34:48.12 --> 00:34:49.84 So, that's good that he went through this.
00:34:49.84 --> 00:34:50.84 Really?
00:34:50.84 --> 00:34:51.84 Yeah.
00:34:51.84 --> 00:34:52.84 Yeah.
00:34:52.84 --> 00:34:55.12 And what's good, the other good, psychologically, you know, do you recognize psychologically,
00:34:55.12 --> 00:34:57.12 he recognized that he lost his mind?
00:34:57.12 --> 00:34:58.12 I got what he said.
00:34:58.12 --> 00:35:01.48 He said, uh, he did fear.
00:35:01.48 --> 00:35:03.12 Yeah, I got fear.
00:35:03.12 --> 00:35:06.12 Oh, is it?
00:35:06.12 --> 00:35:09.36 In one match, I completely lost focus and control of my mind.
00:35:09.36 --> 00:35:13.96 So, once you, that's just, and what you just said, when you get that, when you experience
00:35:13.96 --> 00:35:17.72 that, that's a good thing to experience because then you learn to recognize that you're
00:35:17.72 --> 00:35:22.60 losing control and you're losing your mind and you're going to, when you realize that, it
00:35:22.60 --> 00:35:24.48 allows you to start monitoring it.
00:35:24.48 --> 00:35:25.48 Yeah.
00:35:25.48 --> 00:35:27.52 You've never been to, because there's people that are listening to this right now that have
00:35:27.52 --> 00:35:28.88 never lost their mind before.
00:35:28.88 --> 00:35:30.60 They've never been overwhelmed by something.
00:35:30.60 --> 00:35:33.80 And just not knowing what to do, never been frozen.
00:35:33.80 --> 00:35:35.76 You've never been frozen with fear.
00:35:35.76 --> 00:35:36.76 Frozen with fear.
00:35:36.76 --> 00:35:41.32 If you've never felt your fight or flight thing engaged, then when it happens, you won't
00:35:41.32 --> 00:35:42.32 know what it is.
00:35:42.32 --> 00:35:43.32 Yeah.
00:35:43.32 --> 00:35:44.56 You want to know what it is.
00:35:44.56 --> 00:35:47.48 So that way when it happens, you can go, okay, know what's happening right here.
00:35:47.48 --> 00:35:48.48 Yeah.
00:35:48.48 --> 00:35:50.32 I'm going to make this, I'm going to make this decision.
00:35:50.32 --> 00:35:51.32 Yeah.
00:35:51.32 --> 00:35:58.48 And how you're saying, when you train boxing or, um, um, boxing, yeah, yeah, and MMA.
00:35:58.48 --> 00:36:01.52 So when you get hit in the face, when we talked about this before, when you get hit in the
00:36:01.52 --> 00:36:04.20 face, then you have it really been hit in the face before.
00:36:04.20 --> 00:36:07.48 Like, that's a, it'll throw you off.
00:36:07.48 --> 00:36:08.48 Oh, yeah.
00:36:08.48 --> 00:36:10.48 That's just to put really mildly it'll throw you off.
00:36:10.48 --> 00:36:15.96 So especially, yeah, you're right, because when you see someone get punched in the face
00:36:15.96 --> 00:36:20.000 and moving it, it seems like it doesn't really face in that match and they keep going.
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.36 If that's what your expect is going to happen when you get punched in the face,
00:36:22.36 --> 00:36:23.36 that's the wrong idea.
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:24.36 Yeah.
00:36:24.36 --> 00:36:26.48 Because what's going to, if you've never been punched in the face before when you get punched,
00:36:26.48 --> 00:36:27.80 it's a little shocker.
00:36:27.80 --> 00:36:28.80 Yeah.
00:36:28.80 --> 00:36:32.44 And there's pain and your eyes get blurry and you're, you get a little flash.
00:36:32.44 --> 00:36:35.000 I mean, there's a lot of things that go on when you get punched in the face.
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.76 Once you get used to it, you're like, you can move right through it.
00:36:37.76 --> 00:36:38.76 Exactly.
00:36:38.76 --> 00:36:40.44 But if you're not used to it, it's a problem.
00:36:40.44 --> 00:36:41.44 Yeah.
00:36:41.44 --> 00:36:42.44 Fully.
00:36:42.44 --> 00:36:43.76 And it's, that's another one.
00:36:43.76 --> 00:36:48.04 It's night and day when a guy has been hit in the face a bunch of times and is used
00:36:48.04 --> 00:36:49.56 to it and a guy who's not used to it.
00:36:49.56 --> 00:36:56.32 Because, you know, like, you can hit a guy in a face or get hit in the face and they'll
00:36:56.32 --> 00:36:57.32 be like, I'm done.
00:36:57.32 --> 00:37:02.56 Like, I didn't really expect this encounter or this experience.
00:37:02.56 --> 00:37:03.56 You don't want to get it.
00:37:03.56 --> 00:37:04.76 And then, oh, they guys, they'll get hit in the face.
00:37:04.76 --> 00:37:07.56 Break their nose, break their jaw, all this stuff and they're keep fighting.
00:37:07.56 --> 00:37:09.56 You know, it's like, dang.
00:37:09.56 --> 00:37:13.36 So that night in a situation, if you're not used to it, which is essentially the same
00:37:13.36 --> 00:37:14.36 thing you went through.
00:37:14.36 --> 00:37:15.36 This guy went wild.
00:37:15.36 --> 00:37:20.56 He wasn't ready for this overwhelming experience and he losses my instinctive.
00:37:20.56 --> 00:37:21.56 Yeah.
00:37:21.56 --> 00:37:22.56 So you can hit in the face.
00:37:22.56 --> 00:37:24.24 Like, I'm regret punching me in my face.
00:37:24.24 --> 00:37:25.24 So hard.
00:37:25.24 --> 00:37:30.76 I don't know if he was mad or just regretting.
00:37:30.76 --> 00:37:31.76 Great.
00:37:31.76 --> 00:37:34.48 James fires it off.
00:37:34.48 --> 00:37:36.20 He punched me right between the eyes.
00:37:36.20 --> 00:37:38.000 Thought he broke my face.
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.84 And it was the kind where it was a timing thing too, where I came in.
00:37:40.84 --> 00:37:45.48 I was shooting in and right before a level change or whatever, he just connected and
00:37:45.48 --> 00:37:46.48 was like, boom.
00:37:46.48 --> 00:37:48.68 And I remember thinking, because I just kept going.
00:37:48.68 --> 00:37:51.92 And I remember thinking, dang, I'm glad I was kind of used to getting hit in the face.
00:37:51.92 --> 00:37:56.48 That would have kind of, the very least paused me for a long time, like, didn't you?
00:37:56.48 --> 00:38:01.96 But I'm thinking, when you imagine just that kind of chaos and sensation that'll just stop
00:38:01.96 --> 00:38:02.96 you.
00:38:02.96 --> 00:38:03.80 But once you're used to it, you're good.
00:38:03.80 --> 00:38:08.04 And this is a good point to bring up with just with any kind of training at like leadership
00:38:08.04 --> 00:38:09.20 training, right?
00:38:09.20 --> 00:38:13.000 When you have leaders that haven't been put in certain situations before, that's why I
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000 actually love front.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000 We do role playing exercises with people.
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.52 And you put people in situations.
00:38:17.52 --> 00:38:21.60 The first time you put them in situations like dealing with a hostile subordinate that
00:38:21.60 --> 00:38:23.44 doesn't want to do the plan.
00:38:23.44 --> 00:38:27.52 The first time they get put in that scenario, they just, they just fall apart.
00:38:27.52 --> 00:38:29.64 I told you to do it in here.
00:38:29.64 --> 00:38:31.52 Okay, let's replay that.
00:38:31.52 --> 00:38:36.68 By the third time you're doing it, already handling the job, handling the scenario infinitely
00:38:36.68 --> 00:38:39.96 better, infinitely better than they did the first time.
00:38:39.96 --> 00:38:44.84 So it's the same with everything in life, like the exposure to it and the rehearsal
00:38:44.84 --> 00:38:52.68 of it gives you such a massive advantage that to not rehearse and to not train is, it's
00:38:52.68 --> 00:38:54.40 actually sad.
00:38:54.40 --> 00:38:57.80 And that's actually, the National Enfronts are great example because that's why we're
00:38:57.80 --> 00:39:02.52 in business because people don't even know that they should be doing this.
00:39:02.52 --> 00:39:12.68 And to go to a company that has 50, 100, 150, 200 leaders that are leading teams and they
00:39:12.68 --> 00:39:14.76 have no leadership training.
00:39:14.76 --> 00:39:19.68 And therefore we're all surprised when the leader doesn't get the teams to do what they're
00:39:19.68 --> 00:39:20.68 supposed to do.
00:39:20.68 --> 00:39:21.68 Who taught him how to lead?
00:39:21.68 --> 00:39:25.84 Because you just don't show, you just don't show up to work, no one how to lead.
00:39:25.84 --> 00:39:27.52 No, you actually get trained to lead.
00:39:27.52 --> 00:39:31.68 Yeah, all these unfamiliar micro scenarios happen in.
00:39:31.68 --> 00:39:36.12 That's one of the, that's one of the, like, the muster we do these little drills at the
00:39:36.12 --> 00:39:37.12 muster.
00:39:37.12 --> 00:39:41.64 And you could see, people are overwhelmed with the knowledge that they gained from two
00:39:41.64 --> 00:39:44.16 or three little scenarios that we put in front of them.
00:39:44.16 --> 00:39:45.92 And these are common scenarios that happen all the time.
00:39:45.92 --> 00:39:51.92 But when you watch seasoned business leaders, trying to handle a scenario that they haven't
00:39:51.92 --> 00:39:52.92 seen before.
00:39:52.92 --> 00:39:56.24 Now they might have seen it before, but they never actually had to deal with it.
00:39:56.24 --> 00:39:58.84 The first time they try to deal with it, they fall apart.
00:39:58.84 --> 00:40:03.60 And it's real, I've been, it takes like 10 seconds before you go, okay, let's just stop.
00:40:03.60 --> 00:40:05.24 Because you've already got this guy mad at you.
00:40:05.24 --> 00:40:06.96 Well, let's try this again.
00:40:06.96 --> 00:40:09.16 Because we haven't been through this situation before.
00:40:09.16 --> 00:40:11.16 They never been punched in the face before.
00:40:11.16 --> 00:40:12.16 Yeah.
00:40:12.16 --> 00:40:13.84 And that's the problem.
00:40:13.84 --> 00:40:14.84 Don't let it happen.
00:40:14.84 --> 00:40:16.84 Get punched in the face a few times.
00:40:16.84 --> 00:40:17.84 Yeah.
00:40:17.84 --> 00:40:18.84 Just you be.
00:40:18.84 --> 00:40:19.84 Yeah.
00:40:19.84 --> 00:40:20.84 You can do this.
00:40:20.84 --> 00:40:23.44 It's kind of like, remember when we were kids, there was this, this is, you know, like,
00:40:23.44 --> 00:40:24.44 really chewing gum.
00:40:24.44 --> 00:40:25.44 Yeah.
00:40:25.44 --> 00:40:28.24 And then the little packs that for five of them, they're just small little thing.
00:40:28.24 --> 00:40:31.64 And you, you know, you grab one and this one kind of stick in now, you can say, hey, you
00:40:31.64 --> 00:40:33.52 know, do you want one off of one of your friends.
00:40:33.52 --> 00:40:36.16 So it was my brother.
00:40:36.16 --> 00:40:39.72 And he did, long story, but he was crying from something else who you said.
00:40:39.72 --> 00:40:40.72 And he was like crying.
00:40:40.72 --> 00:40:42.76 And oh, by the way, you know, he offered me some gum.
00:40:42.76 --> 00:40:43.76 I grabbed the gum.
00:40:43.76 --> 00:40:44.76 And then he was like, oh, those mouse traps.
00:40:44.76 --> 00:40:45.76 Yeah.
00:40:45.76 --> 00:40:48.76 And it slaps you and kind of hurts with your little kitty anyway.
00:40:48.76 --> 00:40:50.76 And it snaps off.
00:40:50.76 --> 00:40:54.08 I'm like, dang, I never, you know, I see he's laughing.
00:40:54.08 --> 00:40:55.76 You cry from something else.
00:40:55.76 --> 00:40:56.76 And then he's laughing.
00:40:56.76 --> 00:40:57.76 And cheer them up, whatever.
00:40:57.76 --> 00:40:58.76 Double leg.
00:40:58.76 --> 00:41:04.000 He's not there for, well, actually, which would have made the double leg even better.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.20 Nonetheless, I'd never seen that before.
00:41:07.20 --> 00:41:10.20 Now someone offers me riggedly gum.
00:41:10.20 --> 00:41:11.20 I'm aware.
00:41:11.20 --> 00:41:12.20 I'm ready for that mouse trap.
00:41:12.20 --> 00:41:14.20 It may be the mouse trap, maybe not.
00:41:14.20 --> 00:41:15.20 Well, you're grabbing by the side.
00:41:15.20 --> 00:41:17.20 I'm driving by the side exactly right.
00:41:17.20 --> 00:41:18.20 Let's learn.
00:41:18.20 --> 00:41:19.20 Yeah, exactly right.
00:41:19.20 --> 00:41:20.20 I'll have to endure that.
00:41:20.20 --> 00:41:23.20 And one more minute.
00:41:23.20 --> 00:41:25.20 Life is no different.
00:41:25.20 --> 00:41:27.20 Next question.
00:41:27.20 --> 00:41:30.20 I'm a chef in a large operation kitchen.
00:41:30.20 --> 00:41:34.48 I'm second in command overseeing a large kitchen staff in part of a five-person management
00:41:34.48 --> 00:41:37.20 team overseeing the entire account.
00:41:37.20 --> 00:41:41.20 Recently, during my last review, I was giving some advice by my boss and his boss.
00:41:41.20 --> 00:41:46.20 I'm unsure about my last two annual reviews have gone very well.
00:41:46.20 --> 00:41:48.20 And I'm on the rise in the company.
00:41:48.20 --> 00:41:53.20 However, they said, if it was important for me to get or heat the however, they said,
00:41:53.20 --> 00:42:03.20 it was important for me to give up some of my kitchen dog mentality and work to showcase my artistic
00:42:03.20 --> 00:42:07.20 side and embrace more of a star role in the spotlight.
00:42:07.20 --> 00:42:09.20 Get out of the kitchen a bit more.
00:42:09.20 --> 00:42:13.20 Get more more gain more exposure specifically with their high profile clients.
00:42:13.20 --> 00:42:18.20 While I appreciate their sentiment and respect their big management skills, their style
00:42:18.20 --> 00:42:24.20 isn't one I strive to emulate or feel would work for me and the way I operate.
00:42:24.20 --> 00:42:31.20 I've always approached my work as more of a craft than an art and I've always like being a trench dog
00:42:31.20 --> 00:42:32.20 with my team.
00:42:32.20 --> 00:42:37.20 My team responds to it and I get results for the business and I feel the results should speak for them
00:42:37.20 --> 00:42:39.20 and I feel the results are not.
00:42:39.20 --> 00:42:41.20 It is propelled my career rapidly thus far.
00:42:41.20 --> 00:42:44.20 So why would I want to change and be something I'm not?
00:42:44.20 --> 00:42:48.20 Should I heat their advice or stick to what I do best?
00:42:48.20 --> 00:42:51.20 Keep getting after it on my terms.
00:42:51.20 --> 00:42:53.20 What are those questions?
00:42:53.20 --> 00:42:58.20 That's just funny how that last statement is framed.
00:42:58.20 --> 00:43:02.20 Should I stick to what I do best and keep getting after it?
00:43:02.20 --> 00:43:07.20 As if to say if you say no you should not stick to what you do best.
00:43:07.20 --> 00:43:09.20 You should not get after it.
00:43:09.20 --> 00:43:14.20 That's the frame there and actually this guy I answered the question real
00:43:14.20 --> 00:43:18.20 Tercely I think this came through Facebook messages that I said.
00:43:18.20 --> 00:43:23.20 Sounds like you found a comfortable little zone for yourself and you want to stay in there.
00:43:23.20 --> 00:43:27.20 Right little cold butter response and he's like,
00:43:27.20 --> 00:43:29.20 I knew it.
00:43:29.20 --> 00:43:34.20 Because as we know in the comfort zone there's no growth in the comfort zone.
00:43:34.20 --> 00:43:43.20 So it's interesting this guy is actually getting some good solid and straightforward advice from up the chain of command.
00:43:43.20 --> 00:43:52.20 Plus I think if they have him as more of a personality than the restaurant will do better and they're trying to build their reputation and your reputation at the same time.
00:43:52.20 --> 00:43:55.20 And that seems pretty reasonable to me right?
00:43:55.20 --> 00:44:03.20 Real familiar with the restaurant business but I'm familiar enough to know if you've got a good reputation with the staff that works at the restaurant.
00:44:03.20 --> 00:44:06.20 It brings in more people like there's no doubt about it.
00:44:06.20 --> 00:44:09.20 The relationship just like any other business.
00:44:09.20 --> 00:44:16.20 The relationships that you build with the customers strengthens them strengthens that relationship and makes them want to come back for more right?
00:44:16.20 --> 00:44:18.20 That's the way it works.
00:44:18.20 --> 00:44:26.20 And so for them to say to you, hey man, hey, you know you're a good cook. We get that. We need a little bit more. We want a little bit more.
00:44:26.20 --> 00:44:27.20 Chef.
00:44:27.20 --> 00:44:30.20 We need somebody that has, yeah chef.
00:44:30.20 --> 00:44:32.20 You're good chef.
00:44:32.20 --> 00:44:34.20 Yeah, yeah, sorry. You're a good chef.
00:44:34.20 --> 00:44:39.20 Well actually, what I think I might have actually purposely said that.
00:44:39.20 --> 00:44:43.20 Like hey, you're doing a good job in the kitchen as a cook.
00:44:43.20 --> 00:44:49.20 We don't need someone that's just cooking the food. We need a chef with a reputation with a personality, right?
00:44:49.20 --> 00:44:51.20 There's a difference there, right?
00:44:51.20 --> 00:44:53.20 So it was called out for a reason.
00:44:53.20 --> 00:44:54.20 Gotcha.
00:44:54.20 --> 00:44:58.20 He's happy and you can see like kitchen dog.
00:44:58.20 --> 00:44:59.20 Yeah, he's proud of that, right?
00:44:59.20 --> 00:45:01.20 And I get that man.
00:45:01.20 --> 00:45:02.20 I get that.
00:45:02.20 --> 00:45:04.20 I get that. Like you're one of the boys.
00:45:04.20 --> 00:45:06.20 You're back in the grind.
00:45:06.20 --> 00:45:08.20 Well let me ask you this.
00:45:08.20 --> 00:45:10.20 Or let me make this statement.
00:45:10.20 --> 00:45:12.20 Guess what you have to do is a seal.
00:45:12.20 --> 00:45:14.20 As a seal leader, guess what you have to do?
00:45:14.20 --> 00:45:16.20 You have to build relationships.
00:45:16.20 --> 00:45:19.20 You have to make your commanding officer trust you.
00:45:19.20 --> 00:45:21.20 You have to build relationships with the army.
00:45:21.20 --> 00:45:23.20 You have to build relationships through the Marine Corps.
00:45:23.20 --> 00:45:25.20 You have to in order to do that.
00:45:25.20 --> 00:45:28.20 You have to like raise your, you have to call a little bit of attention to yourself
00:45:28.20 --> 00:45:32.20 and raise your hand and say, hey, this is who I am.
00:45:32.20 --> 00:45:34.20 You have to take you, this is who I am.
00:45:34.20 --> 00:45:38.20 You have to actually have to step into the spotlight a little bit
00:45:38.20 --> 00:45:41.20 so that you can let people know who you are because if people don't know who you are,
00:45:41.20 --> 00:45:44.20 how do you have a relationship with him and if you don't have a relationship with people
00:45:44.20 --> 00:45:46.20 how can they trust you?
00:45:46.20 --> 00:45:50.20 So, so that's part of it.
00:45:50.20 --> 00:45:52.20 Right. That's part of what they're asking you to do.
00:45:52.20 --> 00:45:58.20 Now, in all seriousness, if you really don't want to do it,
00:45:58.20 --> 00:46:02.20 well then you can keep being the guy that's in the back and guess what?
00:46:02.20 --> 00:46:06.20 You're going to be mad in six months when some other chef gets hired
00:46:06.20 --> 00:46:09.20 for a different chef than all of a sudden he's out making friends with everyone.
00:46:09.20 --> 00:46:12.20 He gets promoted and why do you get promoted?
00:46:12.20 --> 00:46:14.20 Well, look at what the guy's doing.
00:46:14.20 --> 00:46:19.20 But he's not as good as, he's not as good as a cook as I am.
00:46:19.20 --> 00:46:21.20 Guess what? They don't really care.
00:46:21.20 --> 00:46:25.20 Being making the food is only part of what they want you to do.
00:46:25.20 --> 00:46:31.20 Just like being a seal, doing the doing missions is only part of what you need to do to do the mission.
00:46:31.20 --> 00:46:34.20 You can't just be tactically sound. You've got to have the relationship built
00:46:34.20 --> 00:46:38.20 so you can work in the battle space that's owned by a conventional commander.
00:46:38.20 --> 00:46:41.20 You've got to have the relationship that you can get your missions approved
00:46:41.20 --> 00:46:44.20 up the chain of command on the special operation side.
00:46:44.20 --> 00:46:46.20 How do you do that? You build.
00:46:46.20 --> 00:46:50.20 You go out. You talk to people. You get out of your comfort zone.
00:46:50.20 --> 00:46:57.20 So weird thing, you know, I'm kind of anti-social, right?
00:46:57.20 --> 00:47:03.20 Like, if you don't know me, we're not going to have a conversation.
00:47:03.20 --> 00:47:08.20 You know, like, we're not having a conversation.
00:47:08.20 --> 00:47:11.20 I'm not walking up and talking to you. If I don't know you, I'm not walking up and saying,
00:47:11.20 --> 00:47:14.20 hi to you. It's not happening. It's not my personality.
00:47:14.20 --> 00:47:18.20 If you say hi to me, I'll say hi. I'm not disrespectful.
00:47:18.20 --> 00:47:23.20 I'm not rude, but I'm not looking to have a bunch of conversations with people.
00:47:23.20 --> 00:47:26.20 And so that's known to me.
00:47:26.20 --> 00:47:32.20 But that's not okay for the business side of my life, which is, hey, I got to talk to people.
00:47:32.20 --> 00:47:34.20 I got to talk to people. I got to build relationships.
00:47:34.20 --> 00:47:37.20 I got to had to know my commanding officer.
00:47:37.20 --> 00:47:42.20 Had to know the commenter. Had to know the conventional
00:47:42.20 --> 00:47:44.20 Battalion commander. Had to know the brigade commander.
00:47:44.20 --> 00:47:48.20 Had to build relationships. Could I just talk about
00:47:48.20 --> 00:47:52.20 war with the brigade commander?
00:47:52.20 --> 00:47:56.20 Well, I could, but what's more powerful that I talk about war.
00:47:56.20 --> 00:48:00.20 And I talk about where I'm from or where he's from or what, you know,
00:48:00.20 --> 00:48:03.20 other things? Yes, because I want to build a relationship. Why?
00:48:03.20 --> 00:48:05.20 Because I'm trying to build trust. Why?
00:48:05.20 --> 00:48:08.20 Because I wanted to allow me to go out there and do things in his
00:48:08.20 --> 00:48:10.20 battle space.
00:48:10.20 --> 00:48:15.20 So that's what they're asking me. They're asking you to step out of your comfort zone.
00:48:15.20 --> 00:48:18.20 It doesn't need to become your primary focus. No.
00:48:18.20 --> 00:48:20.20 Should you try and step out of the comfort zone?
00:48:20.20 --> 00:48:23.20 If you want to grow, if you want to have more opportunity,
00:48:23.20 --> 00:48:25.20 I would give it a try.
00:48:25.20 --> 00:48:27.20 I would give it a try.
00:48:27.20 --> 00:48:33.20 If not, you know, like I said, if you hate it, and you feel like you're not being true to your true self,
00:48:33.20 --> 00:48:38.20 that's okay. Maybe your true self is meant to be the one that's back, not getting promoted.
00:48:38.20 --> 00:48:39.20 Yeah.
00:48:39.20 --> 00:48:41.20 They need somebody to do that.
00:48:41.20 --> 00:48:44.20 If it's not you, it might be somebody else.
00:48:44.20 --> 00:48:45.20 Yeah.
00:48:45.20 --> 00:48:48.20 So another one of those tough questions where people, you know, hit me with like,
00:48:48.20 --> 00:48:51.20 should I just be, should be loyal to myself.
00:48:51.20 --> 00:48:54.20 Because the obvious, like,
00:48:54.20 --> 00:48:58.20 I think the answer that everyone wants to hear is like, yeah, dude, most important thing is you've got to be loyal to yourself.
00:48:58.20 --> 00:48:59.20 That's the most important thing.
00:48:59.20 --> 00:49:00.20 Yeah.
00:49:00.20 --> 00:49:00.20 Okay.
00:49:00.20 --> 00:49:03.20 If that's what your priority is, then that's the most important thing.
00:49:03.20 --> 00:49:05.20 But guess what?
00:49:05.20 --> 00:49:10.20 Who does a who can take care of the other kitchen dogs that respect you so much?
00:49:10.20 --> 00:49:13.20 Who can take a better care of them than you can?
00:49:13.20 --> 00:49:17.20 Because if you get promoted, if you don't get promoted and and
00:49:17.20 --> 00:49:22.20 Johnny glamour boy gets promoted, because he likes to go out and
00:49:22.20 --> 00:49:25.20 push moves to the clients and now he gets promoted and yours.
00:49:25.20 --> 00:49:30.20 And now who's going to take care of the kitchen dogs on his, on his time, right?
00:49:30.20 --> 00:49:31.20 Not him.
00:49:31.20 --> 00:49:32.20 He doesn't care.
00:49:32.20 --> 00:49:35.20 He's got he got promoted, not for taking care of his guys.
00:49:35.20 --> 00:49:38.20 You got promoted because he smooths the clients.
00:49:38.20 --> 00:49:39.20 Yeah.
00:49:39.20 --> 00:49:40.20 And play the game a little bit.
00:49:40.20 --> 00:49:43.20 It's weird when you're explaining that and it's like,
00:49:43.20 --> 00:49:45.20 it makes complete sense.
00:49:45.20 --> 00:49:48.20 I'm thinking of it in terms of like being a, I don't know.
00:49:48.20 --> 00:49:51.20 I guess it applies to any relationship you have.
00:49:51.20 --> 00:49:53.20 Like let's say, okay, you have a wife, right?
00:49:53.20 --> 00:49:55.20 You're buried, whatever.
00:49:55.20 --> 00:50:01.20 And so your wife wants to go to hypothetically.
00:50:01.20 --> 00:50:03.20 Wife wants to go to ananovermott.
00:50:03.20 --> 00:50:05.20 You're like, I don't like vermott.
00:50:05.20 --> 00:50:07.20 You know, go to vermott.
00:50:07.20 --> 00:50:12.20 But you're wife say, hey, I want you to come because I like spending time with you and
00:50:12.20 --> 00:50:13.20 all this stuff.
00:50:13.20 --> 00:50:16.20 And as a husband, you're like, hey, I like spending time with you too.
00:50:16.20 --> 00:50:20.20 Why can't we do something that I specifically like to do?
00:50:20.20 --> 00:50:25.20 And it has to do so a lot of times with like maybe you're ice friends with the
00:50:25.20 --> 00:50:26.20 inlaw.
00:50:26.20 --> 00:50:29.20 So I don't want to hang with you, but I want to hang with them and the wife wants to hang with you
00:50:29.20 --> 00:50:31.20 with the friends and all this stuff or whatever.
00:50:31.20 --> 00:50:38.20 But a lot of the time, in my case, might have been me just sticking in my little comfort zone.
00:50:38.20 --> 00:50:42.20 You know, like the people that I like to hang out with, there's like set stuff that I know they're
00:50:42.20 --> 00:50:45.20 into and I know they like to talk about it and all this stuff.
00:50:45.20 --> 00:50:52.20 And I'm essentially rejecting being open to new or other stuff.
00:50:52.20 --> 00:50:55.20 You know, that's kind of like a situation.
00:50:55.20 --> 00:51:01.20 But in a way, I'm kind of doing what this, what this guy's implying where it's like,
00:51:01.20 --> 00:51:05.20 I'm going to say to myself, my interest and all this stuff, I love my wife 100%.
00:51:05.20 --> 00:51:06.20 That has nothing to do with it.
00:51:06.20 --> 00:51:09.20 Vermont has nothing to do with me and my wife, you know.
00:51:09.20 --> 00:51:14.20 But why shouldn't I step outside of my comfort zone?
00:51:14.20 --> 00:51:18.20 And, you know, try to accommodate her wishes in this way.
00:51:18.20 --> 00:51:20.20 It's not a maker breaker relationship enough like that.
00:51:20.20 --> 00:51:28.20 But if I do that, if I just exercise the ability to be open, I become more valuable of a husband,
00:51:28.20 --> 00:51:32.20 more valuable, I offer more value in the relationship and as a person.
00:51:32.20 --> 00:51:37.20 So, same exact thing when you're explaining this, when this guy's explaining where he's
00:51:37.20 --> 00:51:43.20 awesome in the as a chef in the back, doing the, you know, doing his deal, doing what he does best.
00:51:43.20 --> 00:51:47.20 So, but they, and this guy see it, he's gonna be very see it, obviously,
00:51:47.20 --> 00:51:51.20 where they're like, hey, we want you to do this more stuff even because you're awesome in men.
00:51:51.20 --> 00:51:54.20 Imagine if you had this, this more stuff, you know,
00:51:54.20 --> 00:51:59.20 a valuable you would be as a XYZ, whatever the position is in this case is a chef.
00:51:59.20 --> 00:52:06.20 And to reject that is essentially to say, you know what, I don't want to be more valuable as a chef.
00:52:06.20 --> 00:52:09.20 Or I don't want to be more valuable as a husband.
00:52:09.20 --> 00:52:13.20 I prefer to stick with my current value.
00:52:13.20 --> 00:52:15.20 I don't want to upgrade.
00:52:15.20 --> 00:52:16.20 There you go.
00:52:16.20 --> 00:52:18.20 I refuse to upgrade.
00:52:18.20 --> 00:52:19.20 Some stain.
00:52:19.20 --> 00:52:21.20 True to myself.
00:52:21.20 --> 00:52:22.20 Just saying.
00:52:22.20 --> 00:52:23.20 Anyway, next question.
00:52:23.20 --> 00:52:27.20 I mean, can you cross the line and get to a point where you make yourself sick?
00:52:27.20 --> 00:52:29.20 Because you've done, yeah, then you've gone too far.
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:34.20 That's, you know, like, I got me a leadership, like, yeah, if you become just a,
00:52:34.20 --> 00:52:38.20 disgusting, sick event, then that's what?
00:52:38.20 --> 00:52:39.20 That's not good.
00:52:39.20 --> 00:52:40.20 Yeah.
00:52:40.20 --> 00:52:41.20 So I'm not talking about that.
00:52:41.20 --> 00:52:42.20 Yeah.
00:52:42.20 --> 00:52:45.20 I'm not talking about leaving your values and abandoning your values.
00:52:45.20 --> 00:52:46.20 That's not what I'm talking about.
00:52:46.20 --> 00:52:47.20 Right.
00:52:47.20 --> 00:52:48.20 Talking about playing the game a little bit.
00:52:48.20 --> 00:52:49.20 There's a big difference.
00:52:49.20 --> 00:52:50.20 Step up to the comfort zone.
00:52:50.20 --> 00:52:51.20 Yeah.
00:52:51.20 --> 00:52:52.20 Play the game a little bit.
00:52:52.20 --> 00:52:54.20 At the very least, do it with the open mind.
00:52:54.20 --> 00:52:55.20 See, I like it.
00:52:55.20 --> 00:52:57.20 What if you were like, you got real good at that?
00:52:57.20 --> 00:53:02.20 You know, like public speaking, for example, where I'm no exception.
00:53:02.20 --> 00:53:05.20 A lot of people don't like public speaking.
00:53:05.20 --> 00:53:08.20 Even though they might have a lot to say or whatever, you know, like some people like
00:53:08.20 --> 00:53:11.20 they're smart, but I don't want to get up on state and nothing like that.
00:53:11.20 --> 00:53:12.20 That's dumb.
00:53:12.20 --> 00:53:13.20 I'm not a star.
00:53:13.20 --> 00:53:16.20 I don't want to limelight on me and all this stuff.
00:53:16.20 --> 00:53:20.20 They do one time and they offer like just so much value doing it.
00:53:20.20 --> 00:53:21.20 And then they get used to it.
00:53:21.20 --> 00:53:23.20 Then all of a sudden they kind of like it.
00:53:23.20 --> 00:53:25.20 You know, it could be one of those deals.
00:53:25.20 --> 00:53:26.20 Could be.
00:53:26.20 --> 00:53:27.20 You never know.
00:53:27.20 --> 00:53:29.20 So you try it.
00:53:29.20 --> 00:53:31.20 Next question.
00:53:31.20 --> 00:53:34.20 Two of my bosses have told me I don't like Jocco.
00:53:34.20 --> 00:53:35.20 Interesting.
00:53:35.20 --> 00:53:36.20 Interesting.
00:53:36.20 --> 00:53:38.20 Got that.
00:53:38.20 --> 00:53:43.20 Without giving any valid reasons, their ego is in the way.
00:53:43.20 --> 00:53:47.20 How do I flank them to help them see the path?
00:53:47.20 --> 00:53:53.20 My belief is that they're afraid of the truth and they're afraid of the truth.
00:53:53.20 --> 00:53:55.20 They see an extreme ownership.
00:53:55.20 --> 00:53:56.20 Okay.
00:53:56.20 --> 00:53:59.20 So, yeah, I mean clearly, you go could be a problem here as a leader.
00:53:59.20 --> 00:54:03.20 You know, who wants to constantly be compared to some other leader?
00:54:03.20 --> 00:54:04.20 Right.
00:54:04.20 --> 00:54:08.20 You know, if you were teaching a Jocco, the way that the way that Dean teaches this, you know,
00:54:08.20 --> 00:54:11.20 that would make you mad after all.
00:54:11.20 --> 00:54:13.20 So that could be part of the problem.
00:54:13.20 --> 00:54:14.20 Oh, that's definitely.
00:54:14.20 --> 00:54:17.20 That's that's a way up there on the list of possible things.
00:54:17.20 --> 00:54:19.20 Could be the military flavor, right?
00:54:19.20 --> 00:54:21.20 Some people don't like the military flavor thing.
00:54:21.20 --> 00:54:23.20 So that's that's okay.
00:54:23.20 --> 00:54:24.20 It's.
00:54:24.20 --> 00:54:25.20 It's.
00:54:25.20 --> 00:54:26.20 It's.
00:54:26.20 --> 00:54:27.20 Can turn some people off.
00:54:27.20 --> 00:54:28.20 They don't want to hear about it.
00:54:28.20 --> 00:54:29.20 That's fine.
00:54:29.20 --> 00:54:31.20 The reality is.
00:54:31.20 --> 00:54:32.20 It's.
00:54:32.20 --> 00:54:33.20 It's.
00:54:33.20 --> 00:54:35.20 But here's the reality of the situation.
00:54:35.20 --> 00:54:36.20 Okay.
00:54:36.20 --> 00:54:44.20 What is there to not like about the things that I talk about, right?
00:54:44.20 --> 00:54:46.20 So let's say, you know what, I don't like people taking ownership.
00:54:46.20 --> 00:54:49.20 I want everyone to make excuses and play each other, right?
00:54:49.20 --> 00:54:51.20 It doesn't even make sense.
00:54:51.20 --> 00:54:54.20 You know, instead of, you know, I don't want to hear about this cover move.
00:54:54.20 --> 00:54:56.20 I want everyone to ignore each other and get more.
00:54:56.20 --> 00:54:57.20 You're about themselves, right?
00:54:57.20 --> 00:55:00.20 Like that that that makes no sense whatsoever.
00:55:00.20 --> 00:55:04.20 You know, if, if keeping things simple, I don't want to, hey, look, I don't want to keep things simple.
00:55:04.20 --> 00:55:05.20 I want everything to be so complicated.
00:55:05.20 --> 00:55:07.20 But no one knows what's going on, right?
00:55:07.20 --> 00:55:11.20 Like, look, these things that they make note, there's no human being.
00:55:11.20 --> 00:55:13.20 No one in a leadership position.
00:55:13.20 --> 00:55:20.20 That would want everyone or that would that would go against what these simple principles.
00:55:20.20 --> 00:55:23.20 So.
00:55:23.20 --> 00:55:25.20 How do you fix it then, right?
00:55:25.20 --> 00:55:27.20 What's the problem?
00:55:27.20 --> 00:55:30.20 Well, one, here's a couple, and actually this was a Twitter thing.
00:55:30.20 --> 00:55:35.20 And a bunch of people gave great responses on Twitter after I kind of highlighted it.
00:55:35.20 --> 00:55:41.20 One, one of them, and my, my actual responses like, hey, just don't, you know, stop using my name.
00:55:41.20 --> 00:55:45.20 You know, stop saying, well, joculous it because you can imagine how I'm knowing that much.
00:55:45.20 --> 00:55:48.20 Oh, well, joculous in, you know, when you're in a leadership position, you know, it's like.
00:55:48.20 --> 00:55:50.20 That's going to really great on somebody.
00:55:50.20 --> 00:55:52.20 So, so, so throw that out the window.
00:55:52.20 --> 00:55:58.20 Don't pit it as me, jocco against what your boss is saying, no, don't do that.
00:55:58.20 --> 00:56:01.20 You've set up an adversarial relationship with them.
00:56:01.20 --> 00:56:03.20 And you've set up an adversarial relationship with me.
00:56:03.20 --> 00:56:05.20 And I've never even met these people before.
00:56:05.20 --> 00:56:08.20 I don't even know who they are even know what business they're in.
00:56:08.20 --> 00:56:12.20 But what you've done by constantly harping on it is you've pissed them off.
00:56:12.20 --> 00:56:14.20 And now they're saying, dude, quit talking about jocco.
00:56:14.20 --> 00:56:21.20 We don't care because also the way that he's, just the way he's being offensive in approaching these things.
00:56:21.20 --> 00:56:24.20 And watching these things means that he has a little more listening and growing to do.
00:56:24.20 --> 00:56:29.20 Because if you really want to approach your boss or, you know, he asked about flanking his boss.
00:56:29.20 --> 00:56:32.20 Well, the way you flank someone isn't going, hey, the way jocco is such you should do this.
00:56:32.20 --> 00:56:35.20 Like, no, that's not good.
00:56:35.20 --> 00:56:41.20 So let the principles work on another, another person pointed out, you know,
00:56:41.20 --> 00:56:46.20 Hey, don't, hey, stop trying to impose your things on them.
00:56:46.20 --> 00:56:48.20 Like, just take extreme ownership.
00:56:48.20 --> 00:56:52.20 That's how you step up and start leading. You do your thing. You perform well.
00:56:52.20 --> 00:56:56.20 Quit talking, quit trying to force these things down people's throat and give them space.
00:56:56.20 --> 00:56:57.20 Give them room.
00:56:57.20 --> 00:57:02.20 And then they'll recognize that you're doing a good job.
00:57:02.20 --> 00:57:06.20 If you label it with something that you know, they don't like.
00:57:06.20 --> 00:57:10.20 Well, then they're not going to like it. No matter what you do, no matter what you do.
00:57:10.20 --> 00:57:12.20 That's going to be problematic.
00:57:12.20 --> 00:57:17.20 Don't beludge them with with, well, you know, I, this is blah, blah, blah.
00:57:17.20 --> 00:57:19.20 No, don't do that.
00:57:19.20 --> 00:57:22.20 Take, let, but you're ego in check. How's that sound?
00:57:22.20 --> 00:57:24.20 Put your ego in check a little bit.
00:57:24.20 --> 00:57:28.20 Make the ideas that you're talking about, their ideas.
00:57:28.20 --> 00:57:30.20 Get them to talk about ownership.
00:57:30.20 --> 00:57:33.20 You know, get them, maybe they call it something else.
00:57:33.20 --> 00:57:34.20 Other than extreme ownership.
00:57:34.20 --> 00:57:37.20 Maybe they call it, you know, personal accountability.
00:57:37.20 --> 00:57:40.20 Okay, awesome. That's a great, yeah. I really like that.
00:57:40.20 --> 00:57:42.20 I really like what you've come up with, boss. I'm in with that.
00:57:42.20 --> 00:57:44.20 Oh, well, now they're in the game.
00:57:44.20 --> 00:57:47.20 And they don't realize that you're talking about the same thing.
00:57:47.20 --> 00:57:48.20 That's fine.
00:57:48.20 --> 00:57:49.20 Don't, they don't ever have to realize that.
00:57:49.20 --> 00:57:52.20 They don't ever have to realize that.
00:57:52.20 --> 00:57:55.20 So, I mean, there's some people, there's some people that don't like,
00:57:55.20 --> 00:57:58.20 even in the teams, there's people that like, they didn't like me.
00:57:58.20 --> 00:58:02.20 Didn't matter, didn't matter where what the, the principle was,
00:58:02.20 --> 00:58:04.20 didn't make, oh, that's the law.
00:58:04.20 --> 00:58:06.20 It's like, no.
00:58:06.20 --> 00:58:11.20 Like, hey, just, just don't, don't attach my name to it.
00:58:11.20 --> 00:58:14.20 Yeah. And go and do, be a good leader. How's that?
00:58:14.20 --> 00:58:16.20 So, those are some things.
00:58:16.20 --> 00:58:20.20 I think if you live, live the principles, act on the principles,
00:58:20.20 --> 00:58:23.20 no one's going to be mad at you for taking ownership
00:58:23.20 --> 00:58:25.20 and responsibility of what you're doing.
00:58:25.20 --> 00:58:27.20 Unless you say, oh, you look how I took ownership of that.
00:58:27.20 --> 00:58:30.20 Well, then you might paint yourself into a corner with it.
00:58:30.20 --> 00:58:31.20 They weren't stupid.
00:58:31.20 --> 00:58:34.20 Or they end up not accepting what you're doing.
00:58:34.20 --> 00:58:35.20 Yeah.
00:58:35.20 --> 00:58:37.20 And they'll get mad at you for stepping on their toes, of course.
00:58:37.20 --> 00:58:40.20 And it is also, as you do this, as you take ownership,
00:58:40.20 --> 00:58:42.20 don't rub their noses in it.
00:58:42.20 --> 00:58:44.20 You give them credit. How hard is that?
00:58:44.20 --> 00:58:46.20 You know, you've come up with a pro solution to problem,
00:58:46.20 --> 00:58:48.20 say, hey, no, actually, I got this idea from something like,
00:58:48.20 --> 00:58:49.20 oh, you do it.
00:58:49.20 --> 00:58:50.20 Really?
00:58:50.20 --> 00:58:51.20 Right?
00:58:51.20 --> 00:58:53.20 That's how you, that's how you flank them.
00:58:53.20 --> 00:58:55.20 Hey, it took ownership of this problem.
00:58:55.20 --> 00:58:56.20 Oh, really?
00:58:56.20 --> 00:58:57.20 Oh, you took all the, you're a ghost streamer.
00:58:57.20 --> 00:59:11.20 You know, I don't want to say that.
00:59:11.20 --> 00:59:13.20 Don't say that.
00:59:13.20 --> 00:59:15.20 You know, it's a K-Boss.
00:59:15.20 --> 00:59:17.20 I wanted to make sure this got done correctly.
00:59:17.20 --> 00:59:19.20 I was watching the way you did.
00:59:19.20 --> 00:59:20.20 Dobba, bo, bo, bo, bo.
00:59:20.20 --> 00:59:21.20 You go from there.
00:59:21.20 --> 00:59:22.20 Yeah.
00:59:22.20 --> 00:59:23.20 Give them the idea.
00:59:23.20 --> 00:59:25.20 You know, makes sense.
00:59:25.20 --> 00:59:29.20 is multiple repetitions of what you guys say.
00:59:29.20 --> 00:59:30.20 Yeah, yeah.
00:59:30.20 --> 00:59:34.52 And didn't pick up the vibe, which is like, hey, I'm dealing with someone
00:59:34.52 --> 00:59:37.76 with a big ego and they're not going to take well to me talking about this
00:59:37.76 --> 00:59:39.36 other guys leadership style.
00:59:39.36 --> 00:59:41.76 Do you, you don't want to be compared to some other leader if you're in
00:59:41.76 --> 00:59:42.60 leadership position?
00:59:42.60 --> 00:59:43.60 Yeah.
00:59:43.60 --> 00:59:47.20 And I'm also, this kind of the same thing, but a little bit different.
00:59:47.20 --> 00:59:52.64 The, that thinking about that type of scenario, man, that's the worst.
00:59:52.64 --> 00:59:56.12 That's like as a boss, I would think that that'd be really bad.
00:59:56.12 --> 00:59:58.56 Because okay, so here's his situation.
00:59:58.56 --> 01:00:01.28 So I make videos sometimes.
01:00:01.28 --> 01:00:02.28 Right.
01:00:02.28 --> 01:00:06.24 And so let's say I am, and actually this is an actual thing that actually
01:00:06.24 --> 01:00:10.88 happened where, okay, so I'm in this video for this, we'll say client.
01:00:10.88 --> 01:00:14.48 And, classic, okay, you know, they look at it and it's typical, you know, they'll have
01:00:14.48 --> 01:00:18.72 some input, maybe some information they want to add or take or change or whatever.
01:00:18.72 --> 01:00:24.44 And then this guy said, oh yeah, I'm not sure about this part.
01:00:24.44 --> 01:00:32.44 I showed it to my wife and she said, you know, XYZ and XYZ and I'm thinking, okay, I get it,
01:00:32.44 --> 01:00:35.52 like okay, you showed it to people that understand, but I was like, wait, wait, wait.
01:00:35.52 --> 01:00:40.08 So this is a video I made for you and your deal, you know, kind of thing.
01:00:40.08 --> 01:00:43.08 And you went and showed your wife and then now she has some kind of input.
01:00:43.08 --> 01:00:45.88 She's not part of this deal, you know?
01:00:45.88 --> 01:00:49.68 And now you're like sighting your wife's critique and like all this stuff.
01:00:49.68 --> 01:00:53.24 And it does make sense by the way, as far as what we've discussed and all this stuff, right?
01:00:53.24 --> 01:00:56.76 So the wife is kind of now I kind of have this kind of disdain for the wife.
01:00:56.76 --> 01:00:58.52 I don't know the wife at all, by the way.
01:00:58.52 --> 01:01:00.88 So I'm like, I'm just not feeling the wife anymore.
01:01:00.88 --> 01:01:01.88 You go got the way.
01:01:01.88 --> 01:01:05.68 You know, you're a little bit in it and it's natural is what I'm saying where it's kind
01:01:05.68 --> 01:01:09.08 of like, I thought we were doing this video kind of together and I'll do this for you
01:01:09.08 --> 01:01:12.16 and you give me the input and we're not, you involved your wife in it who threw the whole
01:01:12.16 --> 01:01:13.96 thing off because she's not even part of this little thing.
01:01:13.96 --> 01:01:14.96 Right.
01:01:14.96 --> 01:01:16.56 It's really hard to put your ego in check.
01:01:16.56 --> 01:01:20.76 It's really hard to put your ego in check and actually listen to what the critique points
01:01:20.76 --> 01:01:21.76 are.
01:01:21.76 --> 01:01:24.20 It's hard for anyone to do that.
01:01:24.20 --> 01:01:29.72 And so when it happens, you have to go, okay, that's my ego and you need to put it
01:01:29.72 --> 01:01:30.72 aside.
01:01:30.72 --> 01:01:31.72 Yeah.
01:01:31.72 --> 01:01:33.56 So consider this situation.
01:01:33.56 --> 01:01:38.64 If the guy would have just said, don't say I showed it to my wife and she said this.
01:01:38.64 --> 01:01:42.80 Don't say if he would have said, well, I was thinking about this, which is what the wife
01:01:42.80 --> 01:01:44.28 said, you know, in that whatever.
01:01:44.28 --> 01:01:48.76 I was thinking about this, whether it would have got delivered way better, way easier,
01:01:48.76 --> 01:01:53.32 same thing with your situation if someone's saying, I don't know, let's say, for example,
01:01:53.32 --> 01:01:56.04 it's a fireman, it's a fireman.
01:01:56.04 --> 01:01:59.56 And you know, the boss is saying, hey, we should do this and do that and then this guy
01:01:59.56 --> 01:02:03.60 just, I'll be saying, well, Jocco said, boss is like, who the hell is Jocco?
01:02:03.60 --> 01:02:06.04 I don't remember hiring Jocco, who is this guy?
01:02:06.04 --> 01:02:10.40 And what's he talking about cool, but Jocco has no saying this department.
01:02:10.40 --> 01:02:14.16 It's me and it's you, it's the team, you know, the team that we've worked with kind of
01:02:14.16 --> 01:02:16.000 thing and that's kind of the feeling.
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.32 So yeah, I'm in.
01:02:17.32 --> 01:02:18.32 Don't say Jocco.
01:02:18.32 --> 01:02:21.80 Yeah, I don't need to credit.
01:02:21.80 --> 01:02:22.80 Not all.
01:02:22.80 --> 01:02:25.12 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:02:25.12 --> 01:02:29.92 Next question, Jocco, please explain how working harder for an incompetent superior
01:02:29.92 --> 01:02:31.56 helps oneself.
01:02:31.56 --> 01:02:35.92 I feel like screw them in whatever lightning bolt of luck they were struck by it again in
01:02:35.92 --> 01:02:36.92 their position.
01:02:36.92 --> 01:02:40.72 That kind of like screw them in the horse they rode in.
01:02:40.72 --> 01:02:41.72 Yeah, that is.
01:02:41.72 --> 01:02:42.96 No, he's saying screw them in.
01:02:42.96 --> 01:02:45.76 They're, they're in their position of superior because they got lucky.
01:02:45.76 --> 01:02:46.76 Yeah, yeah, I didn't get lucky.
01:02:46.76 --> 01:02:47.76 Well, that's true.
01:02:47.76 --> 01:02:48.76 Yeah.
01:02:48.76 --> 01:02:51.92 And, you know, here's the answer that is like, okay, so what do you can do then?
01:02:51.92 --> 01:02:52.92 Yeah.
01:02:52.92 --> 01:02:54.16 Okay, what do you can do then?
01:02:54.16 --> 01:02:59.36 You're going to sit around and wait for your own bolt of lightning of luck to hit you.
01:02:59.36 --> 01:03:01.56 Is that what you're going to do?
01:03:01.56 --> 01:03:02.56 I don't recommend that.
01:03:02.56 --> 01:03:06.88 Instead, I recommend that you step up and yes, you do work harder.
01:03:06.88 --> 01:03:11.16 And you do the best possible job that you can do and you take some pride in what you're
01:03:11.16 --> 01:03:13.12 doing and how you're doing it.
01:03:13.12 --> 01:03:18.72 And you do it better than they could not to rub their nose into it, not to prove that you
01:03:18.72 --> 01:03:23.20 can do a better, but out of professionalism.
01:03:23.20 --> 01:03:24.20 That's why you do it.
01:03:24.20 --> 01:03:30.72 Now, one outcome that can come from that is they get credit for your work and that makes
01:03:30.72 --> 01:03:31.72 you all mad.
01:03:31.72 --> 01:03:35.36 No, that's actually good because if they get credit for your work, that's what works going
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:37.80 well, they're going to get promoted.
01:03:37.80 --> 01:03:39.80 And they get the recognition.
01:03:39.80 --> 01:03:43.48 Okay, that's fine.
01:03:43.48 --> 01:03:49.76 But they know where the actual credit goes, even if they don't give it to you, even if
01:03:49.76 --> 01:03:54.60 they don't give it to you, they know it, even if they have a person who doesn't even realize
01:03:54.60 --> 01:03:58.76 that you're like, oh, wow, I did all that work and he's taken all the credit for.
01:03:58.76 --> 01:04:01.72 They don't even know that I made this happen or he doesn't even know that he's that I made
01:04:01.72 --> 01:04:02.72 this happen.
01:04:02.72 --> 01:04:06.16 No, they know.
01:04:06.16 --> 01:04:12.48 So as long as you can keep your ego in check and you can let them have the credit eventually,
01:04:12.48 --> 01:04:13.48 they get promoted.
01:04:13.48 --> 01:04:14.48 The team's doing well.
01:04:14.48 --> 01:04:15.48 You'll look good.
01:04:15.48 --> 01:04:16.48 You'll get promoted.
01:04:16.48 --> 01:04:18.40 Your life is easy.
01:04:18.40 --> 01:04:19.96 Your gaining experience.
01:04:19.96 --> 01:04:20.96 You've got a good reputation.
01:04:20.96 --> 01:04:24.72 Everything is going in your direction.
01:04:24.72 --> 01:04:29.44 And by the way, when that incompetent person does get promoted, who do they usually recommend
01:04:29.44 --> 01:04:30.44 that fills their spot?
01:04:30.44 --> 01:04:32.24 You, because you're the one that got them promoted.
01:04:32.24 --> 01:04:34.84 They're stoked on that.
01:04:34.84 --> 01:04:37.20 Now you become a superstar.
01:04:37.20 --> 01:04:38.20 That's great.
01:04:38.20 --> 01:04:40.64 Eventually they're going to get found out by the way.
01:04:40.64 --> 01:04:43.48 Someone incompetency can't be hidden forever.
01:04:43.48 --> 01:04:45.84 And eventually someone says, wait a second, you didn't even know how to do this.
01:04:45.84 --> 01:04:46.84 That was echo Charles.
01:04:46.84 --> 01:04:48.88 That was doing this this whole time.
01:04:48.88 --> 01:04:49.88 Yeah?
01:04:49.88 --> 01:04:50.88 Okay.
01:04:50.88 --> 01:04:51.68 Okay, well, we're going to promote echo.
01:04:51.68 --> 01:04:53.000 You're out of here.
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.52 That'll happen.
01:04:55.52 --> 01:05:00.68 And when that happens, when that incompetency gets found out, then you will get the recognition
01:05:00.68 --> 01:05:03.28 you deserve, because people said, I don't know, that wasn't Jocco doing all this stuff.
01:05:03.28 --> 01:05:04.28 This was echo.
01:05:04.28 --> 01:05:05.28 There you go.
01:05:05.28 --> 01:05:06.48 Oh, Jocco, you're done.
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:08.80 So that's something to happen.
01:05:08.80 --> 01:05:12.96 Or another outcome that can happen is that they give you the credit that you're
01:05:12.96 --> 01:05:14.64 due, which is great.
01:05:14.64 --> 01:05:15.80 And you still get promoted.
01:05:15.80 --> 01:05:19.04 And you may get promoted above them, which is fine, too.
01:05:19.04 --> 01:05:24.40 And, or they might get promoted, which is fine, stop worrying about it.
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:28.52 So those two things, if you do a good job, eventually something good is going to come out
01:05:28.52 --> 01:05:29.52 of it.
01:05:29.52 --> 01:05:32.72 They get whether it's you both get promoted, whether it's they get promoted above you, whether
01:05:32.72 --> 01:05:33.96 it's you get promoted above them.
01:05:33.96 --> 01:05:34.96 It doesn't matter.
01:05:34.96 --> 01:05:37.56 All those outcomes, or maybe it's just the team continues to do well.
01:05:37.56 --> 01:05:40.32 And your job is stress free and you continue to perform.
01:05:40.32 --> 01:05:45.44 And the division that you're in grows and you get a chance to promote, because everyone's
01:05:45.44 --> 01:05:47.28 getting promoted, it's like, oh, good.
01:05:47.28 --> 01:05:49.96 All good stuff.
01:05:49.96 --> 01:05:53.08 Or you can be angry and you can be frustrated and you can blame your own bad luck and
01:05:53.08 --> 01:05:56.84 you can not work hard and you can not do a good job and you can be recognized as a slacker
01:05:56.84 --> 01:06:01.60 or you can get blamed by the incompetent boss when things do fall short.
01:06:01.60 --> 01:06:03.96 Because that's what the incompetent boss does.
01:06:03.96 --> 01:06:05.76 He doesn't step up and say, go ownership of it.
01:06:05.76 --> 01:06:06.76 He says, no, you know what?
01:06:06.76 --> 01:06:09.08 I would have done a better job, but Echo was slacking.
01:06:09.08 --> 01:06:10.08 That's the problem.
01:06:10.08 --> 01:06:13.24 Now Echo gets fired.
01:06:13.24 --> 01:06:14.72 And guess what?
01:06:14.72 --> 01:06:16.92 Someone, we hire someone else to come in and they start doing a good job.
01:06:16.92 --> 01:06:20.36 The boss is still going to look good and still get promoted, just that you lost your
01:06:20.36 --> 01:06:21.36 job.
01:06:21.36 --> 01:06:22.96 And by the way, you lost your job with a bad reputation.
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:26.68 Now you can't even get a recommendation for a new job.
01:06:26.68 --> 01:06:29.68 Where you lose?
01:06:29.68 --> 01:06:31.56 That's what's going to happen.
01:06:31.56 --> 01:06:33.68 So step up, do your best.
01:06:33.68 --> 01:06:36.28 It'll pay off in the long run.
01:06:36.28 --> 01:06:37.28 Yeah.
01:06:37.28 --> 01:06:40.04 It's funny how like it's one of those things where if you can just flip the switch and
01:06:40.04 --> 01:06:41.64 see that, just that one, you think?
01:06:41.64 --> 01:06:46.92 And it's funny though, too, the way those questions are framed, you know, what they
01:06:46.92 --> 01:06:50.72 want to hear is like, no, you know, what if you got an incompetent boss, you don't help
01:06:50.72 --> 01:06:52.24 them out, you've got a bird.
01:06:52.24 --> 01:06:53.24 Yeah.
01:06:53.24 --> 01:06:54.24 That's what you do.
01:06:54.24 --> 01:06:55.24 That's what people want to hear.
01:06:55.24 --> 01:06:58.000 But it's the easy answer and it's not the smart answer.
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000 And it's a short term answer, not a long term answer.
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.40 Make your boss look great.
01:07:02.40 --> 01:07:03.64 How's that?
01:07:03.64 --> 01:07:04.64 That's my goal.
01:07:04.64 --> 01:07:06.28 I want to make my boss look great.
01:07:06.28 --> 01:07:11.64 There was a little tell in the question too.
01:07:11.64 --> 01:07:12.64 I'm no expert.
01:07:12.64 --> 01:07:14.48 Obviously, but I'm like, both of luck.
01:07:14.48 --> 01:07:15.48 Yeah.
01:07:15.48 --> 01:07:16.56 So you know the whole deal.
01:07:16.56 --> 01:07:19.76 And this is even, you can be a person who recognize this.
01:07:19.76 --> 01:07:23.56 Like people who are bitter, I'm not saying the asker of this question is bad.
01:07:23.56 --> 01:07:24.56 I'm not saying that.
01:07:24.56 --> 01:07:27.52 I'm saying this is an external scenario.
01:07:27.52 --> 01:07:32.000 But you know, if you get a bitter person who's just being in life, maybe not doing it
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.52 as well in life as they had, you know, had hoped or whatever, you'll probably realize
01:07:37.52 --> 01:07:40.60 you'll probably encounter them from time to time.
01:07:40.60 --> 01:07:41.60 No more.
01:07:41.60 --> 01:07:45.40 Saying how the guy who is successful is lucky.
01:07:45.40 --> 01:07:46.80 They're lucky.
01:07:46.80 --> 01:07:50.12 They had a given to them, like all this, all this other stuff.
01:07:50.12 --> 01:07:52.12 Me, I'm not lucky with whatever.
01:07:52.12 --> 01:07:54.16 But it's always the successful guy.
01:07:54.16 --> 01:07:55.16 It's lucky.
01:07:55.16 --> 01:07:56.16 Always.
01:07:56.16 --> 01:07:58.16 Yeah, they attribute other people's success to luck.
01:07:58.16 --> 01:08:03.88 So they're lightning bolt of luck and screw them, you know, kind of thing.
01:08:03.88 --> 01:08:04.88 Just that is indicative.
01:08:04.88 --> 01:08:05.88 I'm not saying it is.
01:08:05.88 --> 01:08:08.60 I'm not saying it is or isn't as far as this particular person.
01:08:08.60 --> 01:08:10.88 But it tends to be like that.
01:08:10.88 --> 01:08:12.36 And again, like that, just that switch.
01:08:12.36 --> 01:08:16.44 If you can turn on the switch and just look at it, just like how you said, it's not intuitive.
01:08:16.44 --> 01:08:17.44 I get it, man.
01:08:17.44 --> 01:08:22.08 Because it's like, I was in that situation where like literally I was doing the work.
01:08:22.08 --> 01:08:23.72 So many think about this.
01:08:23.72 --> 01:08:26.16 You just said you're in this situation.
01:08:26.16 --> 01:08:28.28 Almost everybody has been in this situation.
01:08:28.28 --> 01:08:30.40 And here's the difference.
01:08:30.40 --> 01:08:35.16 If you don't flip that switch and you're in this situation, your whole life goes down
01:08:35.16 --> 01:08:36.16 in the other direction.
01:08:36.16 --> 01:08:37.16 Yeah.
01:08:37.16 --> 01:08:38.16 That's the real problem.
01:08:38.16 --> 01:08:39.16 That's why you meet people.
01:08:39.16 --> 01:08:41.20 You know, this is a thing I think about a lot.
01:08:41.20 --> 01:08:45.36 You know how you know people in your life, their bad asses.
01:08:45.36 --> 01:08:48.84 But they, but they're not going anywhere.
01:08:48.84 --> 01:08:52.04 Like you look at it and you go, man, this kind of smarter than me.
01:08:52.04 --> 01:08:57.92 And a better athlete than me and a better speaker than me.
01:08:57.92 --> 01:08:59.36 But they're not going anywhere.
01:08:59.36 --> 01:09:03.40 And you know why it's because at some point in their life instead of saying, oh, wow, that
01:09:03.40 --> 01:09:04.56 guy's lucky.
01:09:04.56 --> 01:09:06.56 That's what they do.
01:09:06.56 --> 01:09:10.56 At some point in their life instead of saying, hey, that person worked to get in that
01:09:10.56 --> 01:09:12.56 situation and I should do the same.
01:09:12.56 --> 01:09:13.56 Is that a saying that?
01:09:13.56 --> 01:09:15.28 They say, oh, that person got lucky.
01:09:15.28 --> 01:09:16.28 Yeah.
01:09:16.28 --> 01:09:17.28 That's why they're there.
01:09:17.28 --> 01:09:18.28 And I'm down here.
01:09:18.28 --> 01:09:19.28 Yeah.
01:09:19.28 --> 01:09:20.28 You better make them.
01:09:20.28 --> 01:09:21.28 Yeah, you can't make the upward climb.
01:09:21.28 --> 01:09:25.12 If you don't say, you know what, hey, that person might be a little luck there.
01:09:25.12 --> 01:09:27.32 But guess what, they're obviously working hard.
01:09:27.32 --> 01:09:29.80 They're obviously doing something right because I'm down here and they're up there.
01:09:29.80 --> 01:09:31.28 How do I get up there?
01:09:31.28 --> 01:09:32.44 Yeah.
01:09:32.44 --> 01:09:35.64 The answer to get up there is not by tearing them down.
01:09:35.64 --> 01:09:38.20 The answer to get up there is by working hard.
01:09:38.20 --> 01:09:39.60 Make them look good.
01:09:39.60 --> 01:09:44.64 That line you said, so what?
01:09:44.64 --> 01:09:46.28 And so what are you going to do about it?
01:09:46.28 --> 01:09:47.28 Yeah, what are you going to do about it?
01:09:47.28 --> 01:09:48.92 That's the switch right there.
01:09:48.92 --> 01:09:50.96 Because I mean, you do with it with kids.
01:09:50.96 --> 01:09:55.40 I've seen some young kids and, you know, same thing like, oh, this is what it is or this
01:09:55.40 --> 01:09:59.40 happened or whatever spilled milk out of no whatever.
01:09:59.40 --> 01:10:00.60 And, you know, the kids crying.
01:10:00.60 --> 01:10:01.60 That's all this stuff.
01:10:01.60 --> 01:10:02.60 It's like, okay.
01:10:02.60 --> 01:10:04.20 So what are you going to do about it?
01:10:04.20 --> 01:10:05.84 So you can cry.
01:10:05.84 --> 01:10:07.24 You totally can.
01:10:07.24 --> 01:10:11.12 And you can complain about how junk that is that the milk, that spill to your toy
01:10:11.12 --> 01:10:12.84 broker, whatever the situation.
01:10:12.84 --> 01:10:14.40 Yeah, because that's all truth.
01:10:14.40 --> 01:10:15.40 Absolutely true.
01:10:15.40 --> 01:10:16.40 And good.
01:10:16.40 --> 01:10:17.40 You can cry whatever.
01:10:17.40 --> 01:10:18.40 You're going to do about it.
01:10:18.40 --> 01:10:19.96 Then, okay, then that's what it's going to be.
01:10:19.96 --> 01:10:20.96 And that's all it's going to be.
01:10:20.96 --> 01:10:22.24 You're going to continue to cry.
01:10:22.24 --> 01:10:26.68 And you're probably going to continue to cry next time it happens to or you clean up the milk,
01:10:26.68 --> 01:10:28.80 you fix your toy, whatever, you know, whatever.
01:10:28.80 --> 01:10:29.80 What are you going to do about it?
01:10:29.80 --> 01:10:31.000 That's the whole thing, you know?
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000 What are you going to do about it?
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000 It's interesting to you.
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.08 There's like a just a known, the right answer seems really obvious when we talk about it
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:41.08 right now.
01:10:41.08 --> 01:10:42.68 But not many people see that right answer.
01:10:42.68 --> 01:10:43.68 No.
01:10:43.68 --> 01:10:47.08 Most people want to just be mad at their boss and be frustrated and undermine them.
01:10:47.08 --> 01:10:50.28 And not work hard so that they don't get any shine on them.
01:10:50.28 --> 01:10:51.28 So, okay, great.
01:10:51.28 --> 01:10:53.56 That's you putting yourself on that barrel, too.
01:10:53.56 --> 01:10:54.56 Don't do it.
01:10:54.56 --> 01:10:55.56 Just crazy.
01:10:55.56 --> 01:10:56.56 Yeah.
01:10:56.56 --> 01:10:57.56 It's good.
01:10:57.56 --> 01:10:58.56 Actuation say it's crazy.
01:10:58.56 --> 01:10:59.56 It's, it makes sense.
01:10:59.56 --> 01:11:02.16 I mean, I felt that before.
01:11:02.16 --> 01:11:03.16 100%.
01:11:03.16 --> 01:11:04.16 Yeah.
01:11:04.16 --> 01:11:05.16 Oh, for sure.
01:11:05.16 --> 01:11:06.16 For sure.
01:11:06.16 --> 01:11:07.16 Next question.
01:11:07.16 --> 01:11:13.20 Can you be default aggressive and relaxed in jujitsu?
01:11:13.20 --> 01:11:14.20 Okay.
01:11:14.20 --> 01:11:15.20 Yeah.
01:11:15.20 --> 01:11:19.16 Yeah, this seems like two opposing things that you can't do at the same time, but the
01:11:19.16 --> 01:11:22.16 actual fact is yes, you can and you should.
01:11:22.16 --> 01:11:26.60 So you want your maneuvers to be aggressive, but you don't want to be using a bunch
01:11:26.60 --> 01:11:29.28 of strength to execute the maneuvers, right?
01:11:29.28 --> 01:11:36.52 You want to aggressively escape your opponent's position before your opponent gets settled.
01:11:36.52 --> 01:11:39.12 Therefore, you don't have to use strength.
01:11:39.12 --> 01:11:40.44 You can use relax it.
01:11:40.44 --> 01:11:41.44 You can relax.
01:11:41.44 --> 01:11:45.92 And you can be proactive, same thing with defending a submission attempt.
01:11:45.92 --> 01:11:52.000 You want to defend that submission attempt aggressively before this submission attempt gets
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.40 settled in.
01:11:54.40 --> 01:11:57.20 You want to move aggressively.
01:11:57.20 --> 01:12:00.04 Again, I'm not talking about strength and spashing.
01:12:00.04 --> 01:12:05.60 I'm talking about moving aggressively before your opponent moves and get ahead of them on
01:12:05.60 --> 01:12:06.60 their U-loop.
01:12:06.60 --> 01:12:10.56 When you get ahead of them on their U-loop, they're going to have issues with you.
01:12:10.56 --> 01:12:13.24 And so yeah, absolutely.
01:12:13.24 --> 01:12:16.72 You can be default aggressive and at the same time you can be relaxed and you should
01:12:16.72 --> 01:12:18.84 that should be your goal.
01:12:18.84 --> 01:12:20.72 Do you sometimes have to use strength in Gjitsu?
01:12:20.72 --> 01:12:22.36 Yes, you do.
01:12:22.36 --> 01:12:23.84 Yes, you do.
01:12:23.84 --> 01:12:25.80 Sometimes you've got to power out of something.
01:12:25.80 --> 01:12:29.52 Why did the reason you had to power out of something is because you were too late because
01:12:29.52 --> 01:12:32.36 you weren't moving aggressively enough.
01:12:32.36 --> 01:12:33.76 You weren't moving quickly enough.
01:12:33.76 --> 01:12:38.24 Because then you got to power out of something and claw those hands, claw that guillotine off
01:12:38.24 --> 01:12:39.24 your neck.
01:12:39.24 --> 01:12:40.24 Do you know what I'm saying?
01:12:40.24 --> 01:12:43.20 You're telling someone they're clawing your fingers away from their neck?
01:12:43.20 --> 01:12:44.20 Yes.
01:12:44.20 --> 01:12:47.92 So when that happens, that person was late.
01:12:47.92 --> 01:12:52.72 And now they're clawing the resorting to strength and resorting to panic, clawing
01:12:52.72 --> 01:12:53.72 at your fingers.
01:12:53.72 --> 01:12:55.60 So no, usually it doesn't even matter.
01:12:55.60 --> 01:12:56.60 They can claw.
01:12:56.60 --> 01:12:57.60 It doesn't matter.
01:12:57.60 --> 01:12:58.60 Good.
01:12:58.60 --> 01:12:59.60 No.
01:12:59.60 --> 01:13:00.60 I like that sense of panic.
01:13:00.60 --> 01:13:02.60 But I feel when they're clawing.
01:13:02.60 --> 01:13:03.60 Yeah, I'm sure you do.
01:13:03.60 --> 01:13:06.48 You really seem like you like it a lot.
01:13:06.48 --> 01:13:07.96 So that's what it is.
01:13:07.96 --> 01:13:09.80 And by the way, this is true in life as well.
01:13:09.80 --> 01:13:18.88 You do like if you are maneuvering correctly, correctly as a leader, you don't have to
01:13:18.88 --> 01:13:24.04 get aggressive at people because they're doing what they're supposed to be doing.
01:13:24.04 --> 01:13:25.52 You don't have to be.
01:13:25.52 --> 01:13:26.52 You shouldn't have to yell.
01:13:26.52 --> 01:13:28.16 If you have to yell as a boss, guess what?
01:13:28.16 --> 01:13:30.08 Your intent wasn't followed.
01:13:30.08 --> 01:13:31.40 Your plan wasn't understood.
01:13:31.40 --> 01:13:34.52 There's so many mistakes that you made if you're yelling as a leader.
01:13:34.52 --> 01:13:35.52 Do you never have to yell?
01:13:35.52 --> 01:13:37.64 Yeah, certainly, sometimes you can yell because you got to make sure you get that emotional
01:13:37.64 --> 01:13:40.44 point across sometimes, you got to make sure that someone really likes someone doesn't seem
01:13:40.44 --> 01:13:43.80 to realize that they may just severe enough that they're warned to yelling and therefore
01:13:43.80 --> 01:13:46.80 it doesn't matter to them because they're dad yelling in their whole life.
01:13:46.80 --> 01:13:48.76 So if you're not yelling, they don't get it.
01:13:48.76 --> 01:13:50.76 So can you can you run to that?
01:13:50.76 --> 01:13:51.76 Problem occasionally.
01:13:51.76 --> 01:13:53.72 Occasionally, very occasionally.
01:13:53.72 --> 01:13:58.52 Very rarely should you run into that situation because if you're doing the right job being
01:13:58.52 --> 01:14:04.24 default, aggressive as a leader, you should be in situations where you never have to yell
01:14:04.24 --> 01:14:09.76 because your people understand what it is that they're supposed to be doing.
01:14:09.76 --> 01:14:11.84 They understand why they're supposed to be doing it.
01:14:11.84 --> 01:14:13.04 They understand what the plan is.
01:14:13.04 --> 01:14:14.48 They understand what the contingencies were.
01:14:14.48 --> 01:14:18.88 They understand what the intent that you had was.
01:14:18.88 --> 01:14:22.36 They understand this way that this fits strategically into the situation.
01:14:22.36 --> 01:14:25.32 They understand all those things and if they understand all those things, then they're
01:14:25.32 --> 01:14:26.32 going to do the right thing.
01:14:26.32 --> 01:14:30.60 And if they don't, if they understand all those things and they still do something that doesn't
01:14:30.60 --> 01:14:33.92 make sense, well, maybe they do deserve to yell that.
01:14:33.92 --> 01:14:36.96 But again, all the first person I check is myself.
01:14:36.96 --> 01:14:40.80 And say, well, obviously, I'd make this clear enough.
01:14:40.80 --> 01:14:44.52 So yes, relax harder.
01:14:44.52 --> 01:14:50.04 So yelling is to leading as using strength is to do you get to.
01:14:50.04 --> 01:14:51.04 So what?
01:14:51.04 --> 01:14:52.04 You gotta do it everyone.
01:14:52.04 --> 01:14:58.28 So if you lay, maybe you lacked on your technique earlier, you gotta make a little
01:14:58.28 --> 01:14:59.28 end.
01:14:59.28 --> 01:15:01.08 But think about this.
01:15:01.08 --> 01:15:02.24 You hurt your stamina.
01:15:02.24 --> 01:15:04.24 Yeah, you're straight.
01:15:04.24 --> 01:15:05.24 And with your little piece of stuff.
01:15:05.24 --> 01:15:08.96 When I yell at you, because something went wrong and you're my subordinate, when
01:15:08.96 --> 01:15:11.76 I yell at you, I pay a little price for that, too.
01:15:11.76 --> 01:15:14.04 Because it better be important.
01:15:14.04 --> 01:15:17.52 And I better really think about it, because I didn't do anything to build our relationship
01:15:17.52 --> 01:15:19.52 and a positive manner by yelling at you.
01:15:19.52 --> 01:15:21.08 Didn't do anything.
01:15:21.08 --> 01:15:25.52 Just like you didn't improve your G2 technique or knowledge.
01:15:25.52 --> 01:15:29.24 Or really, I guess you improved your situation for a moment, right?
01:15:29.24 --> 01:15:30.24 Because you escaped.
01:15:30.24 --> 01:15:31.24 But now you're more tired.
01:15:31.24 --> 01:15:36.000 If I yell that you to do something and you did it, because you were like, okay, well, fine.
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000 I don't want to yell that anymore.
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.52 So I'm just going to do this thing that you don't want to do.
01:15:39.52 --> 01:15:41.56 That's temporary fix.
01:15:41.56 --> 01:15:42.72 It's temporary fix.
01:15:42.72 --> 01:15:44.76 It's temporary fix.
01:15:44.76 --> 01:15:47.88 Yeah, you know how like JPL say, aggressive.
01:15:47.88 --> 01:15:49.68 Is it, or default aggressive?
01:15:49.68 --> 01:15:50.84 Is it towards people?
01:15:50.84 --> 01:15:52.40 It's towards making things happen.
01:15:52.40 --> 01:15:54.60 So like, so did you just the same thing?
01:15:54.60 --> 01:15:56.24 So it's like, I don't aggressively.
01:15:56.24 --> 01:15:58.48 Like, it's in a way.
01:15:58.48 --> 01:16:00.68 You kind of can narrow it down to the timing thing.
01:16:00.68 --> 01:16:04.000 It's like it's like it's either taking action or hesitating kind of thing.
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.64 So you just don't really hesitate.
01:16:05.64 --> 01:16:08.48 You can lay back if that's part of the strategy and stuff like that.
01:16:08.48 --> 01:16:10.12 You can relax once part of the strategy.
01:16:10.12 --> 01:16:11.32 But it's about making things happen.
01:16:11.32 --> 01:16:12.40 Like, what are you trying to make things happen?
01:16:12.40 --> 01:16:13.40 Timing wise.
01:16:13.40 --> 01:16:15.44 So you know how like you have the thing to embarrass us.
01:16:15.44 --> 01:16:17.80 What is the disrespect?
01:16:17.80 --> 01:16:18.80 Remember you asked me that?
01:16:18.80 --> 01:16:19.80 What's the disrespect?
01:16:19.80 --> 01:16:21.80 Oh, it's the G2.
01:16:21.80 --> 01:16:22.80 Yeah, go pass.
01:16:22.80 --> 01:16:23.52 You're a G.
01:16:23.52 --> 01:16:27.44 They you made up, but you made up the terminology as well.
01:16:27.44 --> 01:16:32.76 So the disrespect is basically, when a guy pulls guard or you're in a guard scenario,
01:16:32.76 --> 01:16:35.56 it's actually not even a guard scenario yet.
01:16:35.56 --> 01:16:39.60 It's like you essentially treat that person like they don't even have a guard.
01:16:39.60 --> 01:16:41.24 Like the guard doesn't even exist.
01:16:41.24 --> 01:16:43.92 That's how little respect you have for the guard in then you just pass.
01:16:43.92 --> 01:16:47.88 But when you kind of think about it when I think about it when you've done it to me the
01:16:47.88 --> 01:16:51.20 times you have, it is literally that.
01:16:51.20 --> 01:16:56.36 So before I can establish any kind of position to establish guard, you're just, yeah,
01:16:56.36 --> 01:16:59.80 you're a pass it, you're done, you don't even consider the guard.
01:16:59.80 --> 01:17:03.80 You know what's weird is, is where people get confused on this though, is they think,
01:17:03.80 --> 01:17:05.76 oh, so you're saying move faster.
01:17:05.76 --> 01:17:06.76 Yeah, right?
01:17:06.76 --> 01:17:07.76 That's the weird thing.
01:17:07.76 --> 01:17:09.08 Yeah, it is.
01:17:09.08 --> 01:17:16.000 It's not, I'm sure I'll think of this at a later time, but it's not about moving faster.
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000 Yes.
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.20 It's about moving more aggressively.
01:17:18.20 --> 01:17:19.20 Yeah, it's not faster.
01:17:19.20 --> 01:17:24.60 It's like being proactive and being aggressive and shutting down the situation before
01:17:24.60 --> 01:17:27.68 or even becomes the situation that you know what's going to become.
01:17:27.68 --> 01:17:32.32 Yeah, so if you take, like you said, like if you take a take in action and hesitation
01:17:32.32 --> 01:17:36.000 you take those two, it's basically you're narrowing the hesitation down to zero.
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000 It's possible.
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.32 That's literally what it is.
01:17:38.32 --> 01:17:39.72 Yeah, just take action.
01:17:39.72 --> 01:17:44.52 And again, you can relax, you can wait, but it's not hesitation waiting.
01:17:44.52 --> 01:17:48.60 It's waiting, it's like more like being patient or waiting for a very specific reason.
01:17:48.60 --> 01:17:51.24 You can do all those things, but there's no hesitation.
01:17:51.24 --> 01:17:53.36 That's what I think that is.
01:17:53.36 --> 01:17:55.36 And then obviously it's going to vary from the system.
01:17:55.36 --> 01:18:00.92 Yeah, this is something you hear over and over and over again in combat leadership philosophies.
01:18:00.92 --> 01:18:03.88 Like doing something now is better than waiting.
01:18:03.88 --> 01:18:08.48 Doing something, doing something that's pretty good right now is infinitely better than doing
01:18:08.48 --> 01:18:10.28 something that's great in two days.
01:18:10.28 --> 01:18:13.000 Yeah, good when better than a great thing.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.96 It's like the aggressive makes something happen.
01:18:14.96 --> 01:18:17.80 Like that is so important.
01:18:17.80 --> 01:18:18.80 Can you overdo it?
01:18:18.80 --> 01:18:19.80 Yes, you can.
01:18:19.80 --> 01:18:20.80 Can you make stupid decisions?
01:18:20.80 --> 01:18:22.28 Because you rushed, yes, you can.
01:18:22.28 --> 01:18:23.64 Is there a dichotomy in this?
01:18:23.64 --> 01:18:25.64 Absolutely, there is.
01:18:25.64 --> 01:18:27.64 That's, there's a dichotomy in every part of it.
01:18:27.64 --> 01:18:31.52 So in every type of leadership, there's a dichotomy in Getsu, right?
01:18:31.52 --> 01:18:35.88 There's a dichotomy because if I just rushed to a situation, well, that might be the
01:18:35.88 --> 01:18:37.44 situation that you want to be to rushed to.
01:18:37.44 --> 01:18:39.20 You gave me the opening, the trap.
01:18:39.20 --> 01:18:41.20 Yeah, the trap.
01:18:41.20 --> 01:18:44.88 So it's like, you know, when you're helping your friend move and then you get like three
01:18:44.88 --> 01:18:50.000 four other friends, you know, and everyone's waiting around to be like, okay, where do
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000 we start?
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.80 Okay, where do we put, you know, where do we start?
01:18:52.80 --> 01:18:54.64 Who's starting first kind of thing?
01:18:54.64 --> 01:18:57.12 The default aggressive guy is just going to start moving stuff.
01:18:57.12 --> 01:18:58.12 Yeah.
01:18:58.12 --> 01:19:01.40 And that seemed like, okay, that's like a little lighthearted scenario, but that's
01:19:01.40 --> 01:19:02.40 real.
01:19:02.40 --> 01:19:03.40 That's what I would run into it.
01:19:03.40 --> 01:19:06.52 You know, when there's a bunch of people and we're all capable of making the decision,
01:19:06.52 --> 01:19:10.24 it kind of paralyzes everyone because this is so true.
01:19:10.24 --> 01:19:13.56 That scenario that you're talking about, it happens over and over and over again in the business
01:19:13.56 --> 01:19:14.56 world.
01:19:14.56 --> 01:19:15.56 It happens over and over again on the battlefield.
01:19:15.56 --> 01:19:19.56 It happens on the training field where there's a bunch of people in no one's
01:19:19.56 --> 01:19:20.56 taking leadership decision.
01:19:20.56 --> 01:19:24.40 Yeah, like you're all it takes is someone to say, hey, we're moving this over
01:19:24.40 --> 01:19:25.40 here.
01:19:25.40 --> 01:19:26.40 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:19:26.40 --> 01:19:27.40 They put all this to get all the stuff off the truck right now.
01:19:27.40 --> 01:19:28.40 Boom.
01:19:28.40 --> 01:19:29.68 Yeah, guys are like, okay, cool, we'll make it happen.
01:19:29.68 --> 01:19:32.88 Yeah, like your oil rig scenario of the main one.
01:19:32.88 --> 01:19:33.88 The exact same thing.
01:19:33.88 --> 01:19:34.88 Yeah.
01:19:34.88 --> 01:19:40.08 And if you're default aggressive, meaning that's your default.
01:19:40.08 --> 01:19:41.08 That's your zero.
01:19:41.08 --> 01:19:45.48 You're that 100% then you're just pandiling business.
01:19:45.48 --> 01:19:46.48 Right.
01:19:46.48 --> 01:19:48.08 Your whole life until you take it too far.
01:19:48.08 --> 01:19:51.40 Yeah, and you're trying to run stuff that other people might have a better vision of
01:19:51.40 --> 01:19:52.40 what to do.
01:19:52.40 --> 01:19:58.60 Like if I might be, I found moldy moving for the first time ever on our moving team.
01:19:58.60 --> 01:20:00.72 And I come in and I'm like, hey, guess what, hey, we're going to start getting this
01:20:00.72 --> 01:20:01.72 to heavy stuff.
01:20:01.72 --> 01:20:04.08 And you're like, hey, actually, that's not a good idea.
01:20:04.08 --> 01:20:05.08 We should do this.
01:20:05.08 --> 01:20:07.76 We should get this stuff in here in the truck first or whatever, right?
01:20:07.76 --> 01:20:09.08 Because you've been doing it longer.
01:20:09.08 --> 01:20:12.52 So even though it's got to be your default mode, again, there's a dichotomy you can
01:20:12.52 --> 01:20:13.52 push it too far.
01:20:13.52 --> 01:20:14.52 Put a keypire.
01:20:14.52 --> 01:20:15.52 I'm so open.
01:20:15.52 --> 01:20:16.52 That's a question.
01:20:16.52 --> 01:20:18.88 More.
01:20:18.88 --> 01:20:21.48 Jocco.
01:20:21.48 --> 01:20:29.24 How do self-awareness, self-assessment, and self-improvement begin and how do they continue
01:20:29.24 --> 01:20:31.24 over time?
01:20:31.24 --> 01:20:36.96 Well, they're all tied together.
01:20:36.96 --> 01:20:45.16 And it starts with being self-aware, with being able to detach.
01:20:45.16 --> 01:20:53.52 Because if you can't attach from yourself, then you can't see yourself.
01:20:53.52 --> 01:20:58.36 And so people ask, how do you detach from yourself?
01:20:58.36 --> 01:20:59.52 How do you learn to do that?
01:20:59.52 --> 01:21:06.80 And a good drill for this is try to imagine the way other people see you.
01:21:06.80 --> 01:21:12.36 And what other people are thinking of you?
01:21:12.36 --> 01:21:18.48 And one place where this happens and it definitely happens to me is when I started getting
01:21:18.48 --> 01:21:23.88 putting charge of things, I started thinking about other people's perspectives.
01:21:23.88 --> 01:21:26.28 What do they see?
01:21:26.28 --> 01:21:30.40 If you're in charge, then what are your subordinates?
01:21:30.40 --> 01:21:31.40 See you do.
01:21:31.40 --> 01:21:32.76 What are your subordinates?
01:21:32.76 --> 01:21:42.88 Are you saying what kind of representation are they receiving?
01:21:42.88 --> 01:21:46.40 And if you work for someone else, it's the same questions.
01:21:46.40 --> 01:21:48.72 What does the boss see me do?
01:21:48.72 --> 01:21:51.20 What does the boss hear me say?
01:21:51.20 --> 01:21:58.56 What kind of representation am I making of myself to my boss?
01:21:58.56 --> 01:22:03.44 And then you start thinking about what are your friends and family think?
01:22:03.44 --> 01:22:06.04 What do they see?
01:22:06.04 --> 01:22:09.80 What do they hear?
01:22:09.80 --> 01:22:14.96 And so the question becomes how well do you represent yourself?
01:22:14.96 --> 01:22:17.52 What shortfalls do you have?
01:22:17.52 --> 01:22:26.80 Now, when you first start looking, it's like you're looking at an overgrown lawn.
01:22:26.80 --> 01:22:29.40 There are some big obvious problems.
01:22:29.40 --> 01:22:34.56 So you do a broad, just kind of general cut of the grass.
01:22:34.56 --> 01:22:39.56 You fix some of the big easy problems that are obvious.
01:22:39.56 --> 01:22:42.36 I want you to done that.
01:22:42.36 --> 01:22:46.04 I want you to have gotten rid of some of those big obvious problems.
01:22:46.04 --> 01:22:49.52 You notice some more detailed problems.
01:22:49.52 --> 01:22:50.92 So you then you handle them.
01:22:50.92 --> 01:22:55.56 And once you've got those handled, you see even smaller and more detailed issues.
01:22:55.56 --> 01:23:00.96 So you start trying to fix them.
01:23:00.96 --> 01:23:03.76 And that's what you do with yourself.
01:23:03.76 --> 01:23:10.60 You continually detach and then you look and then you refine and then you detach and then
01:23:10.60 --> 01:23:16.08 you look and then you refine and then you detach and then you look and then you refine.
01:23:16.08 --> 01:23:20.04 That's what you do.
01:23:20.04 --> 01:23:22.40 That's how you get better.
01:23:22.40 --> 01:23:25.60 And that process doesn't stop.
01:23:25.60 --> 01:23:35.28 It can't stop because if you stop refining, then the weeds grow back and the next thing
01:23:35.28 --> 01:23:38.88 you know, you can't see yourself anymore.
01:23:38.88 --> 01:23:50.04 And when you can't see yourself anymore, when you stop looking at yourself, then you accept
01:23:50.04 --> 01:23:53.96 anything.
01:23:53.96 --> 01:23:57.52 And that's wrong.
01:23:57.52 --> 01:23:59.32 Don't accept the faults.
01:23:59.32 --> 01:24:02.16 Don't give yourself the benefit of the doubt.
01:24:02.16 --> 01:24:10.20 You've got to be your own harshest critic.
01:24:10.20 --> 01:24:22.36 And hold the line and don't let go.
01:24:22.36 --> 01:24:28.36 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
01:24:28.36 --> 01:24:38.52 So echo Charles, if speaking of improving ourselves, should we have any recommendations
01:24:38.52 --> 01:24:41.92 as to how we might be able to improve ourselves a little bit?
01:24:41.92 --> 01:24:45.000 Sure, improve and maintain.
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000 Improve maintain, improve maintain.
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.84 Well, something like that.
01:24:50.84 --> 01:24:51.84 I would recommend.
01:24:51.84 --> 01:24:53.96 Okay, let's start with the workout.
01:24:53.96 --> 01:24:58.40 Work it out is established and known.
01:24:58.40 --> 01:24:59.40 Well known.
01:24:59.40 --> 01:25:03.84 By the way, to be one of the only things that you can do that all the fact every other
01:25:03.84 --> 01:25:06.08 part of your life in a good way.
01:25:06.08 --> 01:25:09.36 So also one of those things that will more health.
01:25:09.36 --> 01:25:10.84 If you lose that, you lose everything.
01:25:10.84 --> 01:25:13.08 It's one of those things.
01:25:13.08 --> 01:25:17.28 So why do some of us not regard it in that way?
01:25:17.28 --> 01:25:19.64 100% of the time.
01:25:19.64 --> 01:25:22.92 Why do people not have time to exercise?
01:25:22.92 --> 01:25:24.32 Lack of discipline.
01:25:24.32 --> 01:25:25.32 Yeah.
01:25:25.32 --> 01:25:26.32 Possibly.
01:25:26.32 --> 01:25:29.12 It might be that short term payoff thing.
01:25:29.12 --> 01:25:31.64 You know, it's natural to seek short term payoff.
01:25:31.64 --> 01:25:32.64 It's natural.
01:25:32.64 --> 01:25:33.64 Think that's it.
01:25:33.64 --> 01:25:38.52 Because again, you lose your health, you lose everything straight up.
01:25:38.52 --> 01:25:41.88 So why wouldn't it be first in the priority list?
01:25:41.88 --> 01:25:43.20 I don't have time to exercise.
01:25:43.20 --> 01:25:44.56 No, you have time to exercise.
01:25:44.56 --> 01:25:48.64 You might not have time to rest to the stuff in life.
01:25:48.64 --> 01:25:49.64 Really?
01:25:49.64 --> 01:25:50.64 That's how it should be.
01:25:50.64 --> 01:25:51.64 Right?
01:25:51.64 --> 01:25:55.64 Nonetheless, when you're exercising, you join some like, do you generate?
01:25:55.64 --> 01:25:57.96 But don't worry about that, even.
01:25:57.96 --> 01:26:00.56 Because chocolate supplements, chocolate supplements.
01:26:00.56 --> 01:26:04.56 Go super-crile oil. This will make it three for your joints for a lot of other stuff
01:26:04.56 --> 01:26:05.56 too, by the way.
01:26:05.56 --> 01:26:06.56 Brain.
01:26:06.56 --> 01:26:07.56 Skin.
01:26:07.56 --> 01:26:08.56 Skin tone.
01:26:08.56 --> 01:26:10.56 That's like a supplemental thing.
01:26:10.56 --> 01:26:11.56 But it is good for it nonetheless.
01:26:11.56 --> 01:26:12.56 That's a fact.
01:26:12.56 --> 01:26:14.56 And another one called jacquil joint warfare.
01:26:14.56 --> 01:26:20.96 So your joints, when you start to lose the functionality of your joints, not only
01:26:20.96 --> 01:26:29.96 does it make workouts less desirable, less fun, effective, less fun, less everything.
01:26:29.96 --> 01:26:33.96 It can jam up your health.
01:26:33.96 --> 01:26:34.96 Physically, you can be less capable.
01:26:34.96 --> 01:26:35.96 So you want to maintain your joints.
01:26:35.96 --> 01:26:39.96 I didn't know this, but now that I do, I'm never looking back.
01:26:39.96 --> 01:26:42.96 Jacquil super-crile, take that and join warfare, maintain the joints.
01:26:42.96 --> 01:26:44.96 Maintain the joint health.
01:26:44.96 --> 01:26:46.96 Everything will be there.
01:26:46.96 --> 01:26:47.96 Get the subscription so you don't run out.
01:26:47.96 --> 01:26:48.96 That's what I say.
01:26:48.96 --> 01:26:49.96 Straight up.
01:26:49.96 --> 01:26:51.96 There's a panic mode if you run out.
01:26:51.96 --> 01:26:53.96 Yeah, and you don't want that panic mode.
01:26:53.96 --> 01:26:54.96 You don't even need that panic mode.
01:26:54.96 --> 01:26:56.96 You don't need that in your life, even.
01:26:56.96 --> 01:26:57.96 So wife and father.
01:26:57.96 --> 01:26:59.96 You don't get the subscription, do the recurring one every month.
01:26:59.96 --> 01:27:00.96 Everything wants to have an off-ing.
01:27:00.96 --> 01:27:01.96 You take them.
01:27:01.96 --> 01:27:04.96 Depending, you know, how, how nuts you want to get.
01:27:04.96 --> 01:27:06.96 Also, jacquil has a supplement.
01:27:06.96 --> 01:27:10.96 This is for your brain and your body.
01:27:10.96 --> 01:27:11.96 All in one.
01:27:11.96 --> 01:27:16.96 You don't have to take the pre-workout and the cognitive enhancing new tropic.
01:27:16.96 --> 01:27:17.96 You don't have to do that anywhere.
01:27:17.96 --> 01:27:19.96 You take to just the one called discipline.
01:27:19.96 --> 01:27:21.96 Takes good to, 11-line.
01:27:21.96 --> 01:27:23.96 For a small to-plier.
01:27:23.96 --> 01:27:24.96 Oh, we got it.
01:27:24.96 --> 01:27:25.96 No.
01:27:25.96 --> 01:27:26.96 No.
01:27:26.96 --> 01:27:27.96 Well, that's a good one.
01:27:27.96 --> 01:27:28.96 Take that. That'll help you.
01:27:28.96 --> 01:27:30.96 That'll help you to stay on task.
01:27:30.96 --> 01:27:33.96 Find all the words that you're looking for to use.
01:27:33.96 --> 01:27:36.96 You know, you don't want to, what do you call that anyway?
01:27:36.96 --> 01:27:38.96 That brain, far-brain, far-certainly more.
01:27:38.96 --> 01:27:41.96 Not lanes, not lane, it's not lane, it's a lane word when I say it.
01:27:41.96 --> 01:27:42.96 Absent, mind, didn't this?
01:27:42.96 --> 01:27:43.96 Absent, mind, didn't this?
01:27:43.96 --> 01:27:46.96 You know, it kind of combats all that stuff.
01:27:46.96 --> 01:27:49.96 Present, mind, madness is the opposite of apps.
01:27:49.96 --> 01:27:50.96 Technically.
01:27:50.96 --> 01:27:51.96 Right, that's technically, yeah.
01:27:51.96 --> 01:27:53.96 Nonetheless, promote that.
01:27:53.96 --> 01:27:55.96 And you're all good. It's called discipline.
01:27:55.96 --> 01:27:58.96 Get all these at originmain.com.
01:27:58.96 --> 01:28:00.96 The company is origin. I say origin main.
01:28:00.96 --> 01:28:03.96 I just, that's the company I say it's origin main.
01:28:03.96 --> 01:28:04.96 But it's really called origin.
01:28:04.96 --> 01:28:05.96 It's in main.
01:28:05.96 --> 01:28:08.96 The website is originmain.com.

01:28:12.96 --> 01:28:14.96 Important journey, by the way.
01:28:14.96 --> 01:28:16.96 I would say 90.
01:28:16.96 --> 01:28:17.96 I would say everyone.
01:28:17.96 --> 01:28:19.96 100% 100%.
01:28:19.96 --> 01:28:22.96 Almost 100% of people who start jiu-jitsu will say, okay, it's valuable.
01:28:22.96 --> 01:28:26.96 Whether they stick with it or not, you cannot deny the value of jiu-jitsu.
01:28:26.96 --> 01:28:29.96 Even though that one of the questions earlier,
01:28:29.96 --> 01:28:32.96 boom, you inoculate yourself, you know,
01:28:32.96 --> 01:28:33.96 to all these things.
01:28:33.96 --> 01:28:35.96 And it's weird how it affects the rest of your life.
01:28:35.96 --> 01:28:37.96 Jiu-jitsu is good.
01:28:37.96 --> 01:28:38.96 Yeah, for your whole life.
01:28:38.96 --> 01:28:39.96 Yeah.
01:28:39.96 --> 01:28:41.96 Nonetheless, when you start, you get asked,
01:28:41.96 --> 01:28:43.96 what gees should I get?
01:28:43.96 --> 01:28:44.96 Guess what? Origin.
01:28:44.96 --> 01:28:46.96 You get an origin-gee, main in America.
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:48.96 The fabrics made in America.
01:28:48.96 --> 01:28:51.96 The cotton to make the fabric is made in America.
01:28:51.96 --> 01:28:53.96 We're going all the way down to grown.
01:28:53.96 --> 01:28:56.96 He's straight up from dirt, from the dirt.
01:28:56.96 --> 01:28:57.96 To the sugar.
01:28:57.96 --> 01:28:59.96 To the geetop, to all that stuff.
01:28:59.96 --> 01:29:01.96 They also got hoodies.
01:29:01.96 --> 01:29:06.96 Pizza and me some new sweat suit situation.
01:29:06.96 --> 01:29:07.96 No, joggers.
01:29:07.96 --> 01:29:08.96 Are they nice?
01:29:08.96 --> 01:29:09.96 Got them on right now.
01:29:09.96 --> 01:29:11.96 Straight up, most comfortable.
01:29:11.96 --> 01:29:12.96 Most comfortable clothes.
01:29:12.96 --> 01:29:14.96 Most comfortable clothes.
01:29:14.96 --> 01:29:16.96 Close.
01:29:16.96 --> 01:29:18.96 This goes for all clothing.
01:29:18.96 --> 01:29:19.96 I've ever had.
01:29:19.96 --> 01:29:21.96 And that's saying a lot.
01:29:21.96 --> 01:29:23.96 It's really most comfortable for us.
01:29:23.96 --> 01:29:25.96 Straight up is straight up.
01:29:25.96 --> 01:29:26.96 Yes.
01:29:26.96 --> 01:29:27.96 100%.
01:29:27.96 --> 01:29:29.96 Is it because it's made in America?
01:29:29.96 --> 01:29:30.96 Maybe, maybe not.
01:29:30.96 --> 01:29:33.96 But it does speak a lot for the quality of origin in it of itself.
01:29:33.96 --> 01:29:36.96 And oh, wait, it's comfortable because it was made in America.
01:29:36.96 --> 01:29:37.96 That's the question.
01:29:37.96 --> 01:29:38.96 Is it?
01:29:38.96 --> 01:29:39.96 Or isn't it?
01:29:39.96 --> 01:29:40.96 I don't know.
01:29:40.96 --> 01:29:41.96 But it is comfortable.
01:29:41.96 --> 01:29:42.96 100%.
01:29:42.96 --> 01:29:43.96 The most comfortable.
01:29:43.96 --> 01:29:44.96 That's a good type.
01:29:44.96 --> 01:29:45.96 I know it is.
01:29:45.96 --> 01:29:47.96 Because you are one that deals high and comfort.
01:29:47.96 --> 01:29:48.96 Yes.
01:29:48.96 --> 01:29:49.96 I mean, comfort kind of sore.
01:29:49.96 --> 01:29:50.96 100%.
01:29:50.96 --> 01:29:53.96 And this one graded off the charts.
01:29:53.96 --> 01:29:54.96 Check.
01:29:54.96 --> 01:29:55.96 But later, you take a break.
01:29:55.96 --> 01:29:57.96 So I export stuff.
01:29:57.96 --> 01:30:00.96 You know, in video editing, especially if actually you had to export.
01:30:00.96 --> 01:30:02.96 So 3D stuff, export takes long time.
01:30:02.96 --> 01:30:04.96 3D studio max.
01:30:04.96 --> 01:30:05.96 So what it's called.
01:30:05.96 --> 01:30:07.96 Ticks long time.
01:30:07.96 --> 01:30:11.96 So while it exports, you start using your computer doing other things.
01:30:11.96 --> 01:30:13.96 It kind of, you know, you can jam your up.
01:30:13.96 --> 01:30:14.96 It'll slow down your computer whatever.
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:15.96 So you know, I take a little break.
01:30:15.96 --> 01:30:16.96 I'm going to lay it out on the couch.
01:30:16.96 --> 01:30:18.96 I'm going to order you in whole sweat suit on.
01:30:18.96 --> 01:30:19.96 Get some.
01:30:19.96 --> 01:30:20.96 And I lay down on the couch.
01:30:20.96 --> 01:30:25.96 And like this for some reason, I'm the most comfortable I've ever been in my life.
01:30:25.96 --> 01:30:26.96 You need to make.
01:30:26.96 --> 01:30:27.96 I'll talk to Pete.
01:30:27.96 --> 01:30:31.96 You need like a signature series.
01:30:31.96 --> 01:30:32.96 Come for it.
01:30:32.96 --> 01:30:33.96 Come for it.
01:30:33.96 --> 01:30:34.96 Yeah.
01:30:34.96 --> 01:30:35.96 Yeah.
01:30:35.96 --> 01:30:36.96 Yeah.
01:30:36.96 --> 01:30:37.96 Right.
01:30:37.96 --> 01:30:37.96 Have it on right now.
01:30:37.96 --> 01:30:38.96 That's it.
01:30:38.96 --> 01:30:39.96 You know, you got to do a rename and embroidery on the side.
01:30:39.96 --> 01:30:40.96 Boom.
01:30:40.96 --> 01:30:41.96 That's awesome.
01:30:41.96 --> 01:30:42.96 That's it.
01:30:42.96 --> 01:30:43.96 You know, you got to do a rename and embroidery on the side.
01:30:43.96 --> 01:30:44.96 Boom.
01:30:44.96 --> 01:30:45.96 That's awesome.
01:30:45.96 --> 01:30:47.96 So comfort is kind of a subjective thing.
01:30:47.96 --> 01:30:48.96 Maybe.
01:30:48.96 --> 01:30:49.96 Well, okay.
01:30:49.96 --> 01:30:50.96 I challenge anyone.
01:30:50.96 --> 01:30:54.96 If you have the origin sweatsuit or if you get one, get on it.
01:30:54.96 --> 01:30:56.96 Lay it on on your couch.
01:30:56.96 --> 01:30:59.96 Temperature would have to be just right because if it's hot and you have sweatsuit on,
01:30:59.96 --> 01:31:00.96 and nothing is comfortable.
01:31:00.96 --> 01:31:02.96 But keep that in mind.
01:31:02.96 --> 01:31:03.96 I challenge you to do that.
01:31:03.96 --> 01:31:04.96 Report back.
01:31:04.96 --> 01:31:07.96 If it's not the most comfortable, let me know for 100%.
01:31:07.96 --> 01:31:10.96 You're going to taste them for real comfort.
01:31:10.96 --> 01:31:12.96 American made comfort to buy the way.
01:31:12.96 --> 01:31:13.96 Also.
01:31:13.96 --> 01:31:16.96 If you're into jujitsu.
01:31:16.96 --> 01:31:17.96 Right.
01:31:17.96 --> 01:31:22.96 If you're not into jujitsu, there was a jujitsu immersion camp on all this 26 this year.
01:31:22.96 --> 01:31:24.96 Goes to September 2nd, one week.
01:31:24.96 --> 01:31:26.96 Two sessions in that one week.
01:31:26.96 --> 01:31:27.96 Yeah.
01:31:27.96 --> 01:31:28.96 I'm going.
01:31:28.96 --> 01:31:29.96 Jocca's doing going.
01:31:29.96 --> 01:31:30.96 And so it's Dave Burke.
01:31:30.96 --> 01:31:31.96 The real top gun.
01:31:31.96 --> 01:31:32.96 The real top gun.
01:31:32.96 --> 01:31:33.96 Burke.
01:31:33.96 --> 01:31:34.96 Yes.
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:34.96 Good deal.
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:36.96 You know why he's going?
01:31:36.96 --> 01:31:37.96 He sounded like a good deal.
01:31:37.96 --> 01:31:39.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:39.96 --> 01:31:40.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:40.96 --> 01:31:43.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:43.96 --> 01:31:44.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:44.96 --> 01:31:45.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:45.96 --> 01:31:46.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:46.96 --> 01:31:48.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:48.96 --> 01:31:49.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:49.96 --> 01:31:50.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:50.96 --> 01:31:51.96 It's a good deal.
01:31:51.96 --> 01:31:53.96 It's a win, win, win, win.
01:31:53.96 --> 01:31:54.96 It's like the best.
01:31:54.96 --> 01:31:55.96 A good deal.
01:31:55.96 --> 01:31:56.96 It's like the best case scenario kind of thing.
01:31:56.96 --> 01:31:58.96 That's what a good deal Dave is all about.
01:31:58.96 --> 01:31:59.96 That's just him.
01:31:59.96 --> 01:32:00.96 That's how he is.
01:32:00.96 --> 01:32:01.96 How he rolls.
01:32:01.96 --> 01:32:02.96 Unless.
01:32:02.96 --> 01:32:03.96 Other people would be there.
01:32:03.96 --> 01:32:04.96 It wasn't either.
01:32:04.96 --> 01:32:05.96 Hopefully JP.
01:32:05.96 --> 01:32:06.96 Yeah.
01:32:06.96 --> 01:32:07.96 And life.
01:32:07.96 --> 01:32:09.96 Well, life just got his a strike.
01:32:09.96 --> 01:32:11.96 Another strike on the white belt.
01:32:11.96 --> 01:32:12.96 No white belt.
01:32:12.96 --> 01:32:13.96 Yeah.
01:32:13.96 --> 01:32:14.96 So he might very well be there.
01:32:14.96 --> 01:32:16.96 I think I'll be able to do it by that.
01:32:16.96 --> 01:32:17.96 Maybe.
01:32:17.96 --> 01:32:18.96 Should this pace?
01:32:18.96 --> 01:32:19.96 Yeah.
01:32:19.96 --> 01:32:20.96 If he keeps trading hard.
01:32:20.96 --> 01:32:21.96 Yeah.
01:32:21.96 --> 01:32:22.96 And he has part of the knowledge as well.
01:32:22.96 --> 01:32:23.96 Yeah.
01:32:23.96 --> 01:32:24.96 He never know.
01:32:24.96 --> 01:32:25.96 Yeah.
01:32:25.96 --> 01:32:26.96 So did you see, immerse yourself in your just to best
01:32:26.96 --> 01:32:27.96 wait and learn in my opinion.
01:32:27.96 --> 01:32:28.96 Mine too.
01:32:28.96 --> 01:32:30.96 Not even if you've never gone go.
01:32:30.96 --> 01:32:36.96 Because last time I even went on the side with beginner beginners.
01:32:36.96 --> 01:32:39.96 Like one day zero days experience boom.
01:32:39.96 --> 01:32:43.96 We go through some stuff from and I'm not saying look cool.
01:32:43.96 --> 01:32:44.96 I'm such a good teacher.
01:32:44.96 --> 01:32:45.96 I'm not saying that at all.
01:32:45.96 --> 01:32:49.96 But after like that session, they were ready to go start rolling.
01:32:49.96 --> 01:32:50.96 Humble brag.
01:32:50.96 --> 01:32:52.96 Just saying.
01:32:52.96 --> 01:32:54.96 I know this because that's what they said.
01:32:54.96 --> 01:32:57.96 Not all of them, but some of them said that.
01:32:57.96 --> 01:32:59.96 Nonetheless, I'm saying there's a lot of values.
01:32:59.96 --> 01:33:02.96 You did some value if you've never done you used to before.
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:03.96 Never.
01:33:03.96 --> 01:33:04.96 Yeah.

01:33:57.96 --> 01:33:58.96 It's good.
01:33:58.96 --> 01:33:59.96 Anyway, you don't have to get something.
01:33:59.96 --> 01:34:00.96 But go on there.
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:01.96 Check it out.
01:34:01.96 --> 01:34:02.96 If you like something, get something.
01:34:02.96 --> 01:34:03.96 Really good way to support.
01:34:03.96 --> 01:34:07.96 Also, for workout gear equipment.
01:34:07.96 --> 01:34:13.96 You want to introduce some variety in movements in your workout.
01:34:13.96 --> 01:34:15.96 Good place to go.
01:34:15.96 --> 01:34:17.96 kettlebells, battle ropes, maces.
01:34:17.96 --> 01:34:20.96 Go to on it.com slash jockel.
01:34:20.96 --> 01:34:24.96 I once said, well, actually more than once said that.
01:34:24.96 --> 01:34:26.96 Jockel's workouts are boring.
01:34:26.96 --> 01:34:27.96 They're not.
01:34:27.96 --> 01:34:28.96 I get it.
01:34:28.96 --> 01:34:29.96 They're not boring.
01:34:29.96 --> 01:34:31.96 I retract that statement.
01:34:31.96 --> 01:34:32.96 They're not boring.
01:34:32.96 --> 01:34:39.96 But if you run the risk of gear workouts being boring, just get some new equipment.
01:34:39.96 --> 01:34:40.96 Actually, it's good.
01:34:40.96 --> 01:34:41.96 Because you know when you get new equipment,
01:34:41.96 --> 01:34:43.96 like it, even something that's supposed to jump rope.
01:34:43.96 --> 01:34:46.96 Right, when you get it, kind of rejuvenates a little party.
01:34:46.96 --> 01:34:48.96 You know, it's like when you get a new geek.
01:34:48.96 --> 01:34:49.96 You want to go to practice more.
01:34:49.96 --> 01:34:51.96 You know, you buy some new running shoes.
01:34:51.96 --> 01:34:53.96 Like you kind of compelled to go running.
01:34:53.96 --> 01:34:55.96 So you're basically still a five year old.
01:34:55.96 --> 01:34:56.96 Whatever.
01:34:56.96 --> 01:34:58.96 We kind of all are in a way.
01:34:58.96 --> 01:35:00.96 And if you go to on it.
01:35:00.96 --> 01:35:03.96 You get some new fitness gear.
01:35:03.96 --> 01:35:05.96 It'll introduce a little variety to your workout.
01:35:05.96 --> 01:35:09.96 Different gear, different movement, different workout.
01:35:09.96 --> 01:35:11.96 Keep it on the path even more.
01:35:11.96 --> 01:35:12.96 And make it interesting.
01:35:12.96 --> 01:35:13.96 Maybe fun, man.
01:35:13.96 --> 01:35:14.96 I think it's my opinion.
01:35:14.96 --> 01:35:15.96 Anyway, on it.
01:35:15.96 --> 01:35:16.96 I'm slash jockel.

01:36:06.96 --> 01:36:08.96 Anyway, shareable stuff.
01:36:08.96 --> 01:36:11.96 Like so, you don't have to share a two, three hour podcast with someone.
01:36:11.96 --> 01:36:14.96 And then, you know, when you get something in your message or inbox or whatever.
01:36:14.96 --> 01:36:15.96 And it's two hours long.
01:36:15.96 --> 01:36:17.96 And I'm watching it straight up.
01:36:17.96 --> 01:36:20.96 In fact, I would say even right when you press play.
01:36:20.96 --> 01:36:23.96 Before you even get to like five seconds in, you check.
01:36:23.96 --> 01:36:24.96 See how long it is.
01:36:24.96 --> 01:36:25.96 I think that's a normal protocol.
01:36:25.96 --> 01:36:26.96 That is a normal protocol.
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:28.96 You see two hours you're clicking right out of there.
01:36:28.96 --> 01:36:29.96 The friends, what it is.
01:36:29.96 --> 01:36:30.96 Depend on what it is and depends on.
01:36:30.96 --> 01:36:35.96 But there's not too often that you just got a two hour block from sitting the sit in the side.
01:36:35.96 --> 01:36:36.96 Right.
01:36:36.96 --> 01:36:37.96 Randomly somebody sent me a video.
01:36:37.96 --> 01:36:38.96 Yeah.
01:36:38.96 --> 01:36:39.96 I'll watch right now.
01:36:39.96 --> 01:36:40.96 Yeah, that's not happening.
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:41.96 Yeah, typically doesn't happen like that.
01:36:41.96 --> 01:36:43.96 But three minutes, four minutes.
01:36:43.96 --> 01:36:44.96 Yeah.
01:36:44.96 --> 01:36:47.96 And you might share it with your, you know, your friend.
01:36:47.96 --> 01:36:49.96 Yeah, so subscribe YouTube channel.
01:36:49.96 --> 01:36:51.96 Good way to support.

01:36:52.96 --> 01:36:54.96 Psychological warfare.
01:36:54.96 --> 01:36:55.96 You know what that is?
01:36:55.96 --> 01:36:56.96 This is what it is.
01:36:56.96 --> 01:36:59.96 It's an album with tracks on this album.
01:36:59.96 --> 01:37:00.96 Not music tracks.
01:37:00.96 --> 01:37:01.96 It's jockel tracks.
01:37:01.96 --> 01:37:06.96 And these tracks each track is designated engineered.
01:37:06.96 --> 01:37:07.96 If you will.
01:37:07.96 --> 01:37:09.96 To help you me.
01:37:09.96 --> 01:37:10.96 To help me.

01:37:11.96 --> 01:37:13.96 But it will help you.
01:37:13.96 --> 01:37:17.96 Get past little moments of weakness that you might encounter.
01:37:17.96 --> 01:37:19.96 I'm not saying everyone's going to encounter it.
01:37:19.96 --> 01:37:21.96 Everyone probably will encounter it.
01:37:21.96 --> 01:37:22.96 But that's not the point here.
01:37:22.96 --> 01:37:25.96 Point is, if you do encounter it, you got something to help you.
01:37:25.96 --> 01:37:26.96 You got jockel to help you.
01:37:26.96 --> 01:37:28.96 That's a good deal.
01:37:28.96 --> 01:37:31.96 You want to skip to work out or something like this.
01:37:31.96 --> 01:37:32.96 You don't feel like working out.
01:37:32.96 --> 01:37:33.96 That's really what it is.
01:37:33.96 --> 01:37:35.96 You don't feel like working out.
01:37:35.96 --> 01:37:39.96 The comfort of not working out is distracting you is what it is.
01:37:39.96 --> 01:37:45.96 But it seems more appealing than the discomfort of working out.
01:37:45.96 --> 01:37:47.96 So what it is.
01:37:47.96 --> 01:37:50.96 And then you listen to a track.
01:37:50.96 --> 01:37:51.96 There's a certain track for that.
01:37:51.96 --> 01:37:54.96 Jocquie explains to you why you shouldn't miss the workout.
01:37:54.96 --> 01:37:55.96 Boom.
01:37:55.96 --> 01:37:56.96 Part of the workout you're good.
01:37:56.96 --> 01:37:58.96 And for every little weakness that you might come across is a track for it.
01:37:58.96 --> 01:37:59.96 It's all good.
01:37:59.96 --> 01:38:00.96 Just check it out.
01:38:00.96 --> 01:38:03.96 And think like dang is that one of my weaknesses is boom.

01:38:08.96 --> 01:38:09.96 Cool.
01:38:09.96 --> 01:38:15.96 Also you can get jocquie-t, which I'm not even saying anything else about it because I don't have to.
01:38:15.96 --> 01:38:18.96 Because this is a drink that guarantees in 8,000 pound deadlift.
01:38:18.96 --> 01:38:19.96 And so what else?
01:38:19.96 --> 01:38:21.96 What else could I say?
01:38:21.96 --> 01:38:24.96 Regardless of age, everyone should know.
01:38:24.96 --> 01:38:25.96 And you should be careful with that.
01:38:25.96 --> 01:38:31.96 Because my 8-year-old daughter, she drinks from jocquie-t, 8,000 pounds.
01:38:31.96 --> 01:38:32.96 DL.
