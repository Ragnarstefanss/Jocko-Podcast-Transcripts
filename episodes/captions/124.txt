[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 124.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.
[00:00:07] Good evening, Echo.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:11] Bullets punched through the chopper as Nevanide jumped out.
[00:00:17] Together, we ran over to the farthest wounded guy, grabbed him, ran back and tossed him into the bird.
[00:00:24] We picked up a second wounded in action the same way, and then a third.
[00:00:29] Amazingly, without becoming casualties ourselves.
[00:00:33] But by the time everyone was loaded onto the helicopter, there was no room inside for me.
[00:00:39] I stood on the skids and put on my helmet so I could tell the pilot to take off.
[00:00:44] But I found I couldn't talk.
[00:00:46] I was so dried out, my tongue had welded itself to the roof of my mouth out of pure fear.
[00:00:54] I had to open my canteen and drink some water before I could even gasp.
[00:00:58] Let's get this mother out of here.
[00:01:02] We took the wounded back to base and returned to the flight.
[00:01:06] Without anything holding him up now, I couldn't figure out why Torpy didn't do something
[00:01:12] about getting his men consolidated outside of that patty.
[00:01:18] He still kept saying he was pinned down.
[00:01:20] Finally, I lost my temper.
[00:01:22] I really chewed his ass over the radio, demanding he get cracking and get those men out
[00:01:26] of that patty now.
[00:01:28] Apparently the next thing he did was put down the radio, stand straight up and begin running
[00:01:37] from man to man to get them to move back.
[00:01:43] He got mode down right away and died a short time later.
[00:01:50] Maybe I hadn't learned a damn thing at my con.
[00:01:54] Or from Dennis Foley's near miss in that mine field.
[00:01:59] I hadn't asked Torpy to stand up.
[00:02:02] He didn't need to in order to extricate himself, but it hadn't occurred to me that he would.
[00:02:09] I had been playing the game as if Lieutenant Nap, a lat natural more seasoned leader was
[00:02:14] in charge.
[00:02:17] It was due to the force of my word as his commander that this inexperienced young lieutenant
[00:02:24] was sent to his death, like Jim Gardner's.
[00:02:30] Torpy's death was a big guilt thing for me and has remained so all my life.
[00:02:42] And that is an excerpt from the book about face, which is by Colonel David Hackworth,
[00:02:52] the book that we covered on this podcast.
[00:02:54] In fact, it was the first book we covered on this podcast and there is a reason for that.
[00:03:02] The book about face was and is my favorite book.
[00:03:09] And when I was deployed to a modian 2006, I read it and re-read it every chance I got.
[00:03:17] Now, the book is about war, but I have always found it to be a book about leadership
[00:03:25] and in my opinion, the best book I have ever read about leadership.
[00:03:32] David Hackworth was born and raised in California, lied about his age and joined the
[00:03:36] Marcha Marines and served in the South Pacific in the end of World War II.
[00:03:42] And then he joined the army where he rose through the ranks, serving in the Korean war
[00:03:47] and the Vietnam War, battlefield commissioned.
[00:03:53] Novers' career in combat, he was awarded to Distinguished Service Crosses 8 Silver Stars,
[00:03:57] three legions of merit, a distinguished fine cross, and eight purple hearts.
[00:04:07] And in the end, he became an outspoken opponent of how we were fighting the war in Vietnam
[00:04:17] and that costume his career in the army.
[00:04:22] He went on to write these books and was able to pass on the lessons that he learned
[00:04:28] through these books about face, which as I said, we covered on podcast number two.
[00:04:33] We also wrote a book called The Steel My Soldiers Heart, which is covered on podcast 28.
[00:04:42] And unfortunately he died on May 4th, 2005, before I ever got the chance to meet him.
[00:04:54] But a few months ago someone reached out to me on social media, someone by the name
[00:05:00] of Jay Mukayama.
[00:05:04] And he was a listener to the podcast and he thought I might be interested in talking
[00:05:08] to his father, James Mukayama.
[00:05:12] The name looked pretty familiar.
[00:05:15] I thought I recognized it and I quickly realized that this was the full name of one of
[00:05:21] the men that appeared in both books about face and steel my soldiers heart.
[00:05:27] The man Colonel Hacworth simply called Muk.
[00:05:32] And I replied to Jay and said I would be absolutely honored to be introduced to his father
[00:05:39] who was in fact, Major General James Mukayama, a retired army officer that had served as
[00:05:46] a company commander in Vietnam working directly for Colonel Hacworth.
[00:05:54] After some logistical coordination, it is my absolute honor to welcome General James Mukayama
[00:06:04] to the podcast.
[00:06:06] Sir, this is an absolute honor.
[00:06:09] Well, Jocco, it is the same on this side.
[00:06:14] I've listened to some of your podcasts, especially the one on steel my soldiers hearts.
[00:06:20] And I couldn't stop listening to it.
[00:06:23] And then I realized I looked at my watch and I said, this is over two hours already.
[00:06:29] Just because of the way you picked out the really important things that Hacworth, in fact,
[00:06:39] I forgot a lot of the things until you read verbatim, some of the things that he said.
[00:06:47] And he lived what he wrote.
[00:06:48] I might add.
[00:06:50] He loved by example.
[00:06:53] Well, I definitely have taken a ton of lessons from him over the years and that's why it's
[00:06:58] just amazing to be sitting here with you.
[00:07:00] And let's talk about you though.
[00:07:02] Let's talk about how you ended up in the army and where you came from and what your background
[00:07:06] was.
[00:07:07] You know, once you take us back to Chicago.
[00:07:10] Sure.
[00:07:12] I was born and raised in the inner city of Chicago, a neighborhood called Logan Square, primarily
[00:07:18] Polish German Italian.
[00:07:21] We were the only minority family in that neighborhood.
[00:07:25] We went to a grammar school of 900, my brother and I were the only minorities.
[00:07:31] So I grew up basically in a phenomenally white white environment.
[00:07:37] But I never felt like I was different really because everybody treated me fun.
[00:07:43] It was a time in life in the inner city where everybody knew each other.
[00:07:47] On our neighborhood, our block, we didn't lock our doors.
[00:07:51] Everybody knew that's a time when most mothers stayed at home.
[00:07:58] And they were the police of the block.
[00:08:01] Everybody would come by the was out of order.
[00:08:05] They would take care of it.
[00:08:06] But we were, I'd say, lower middle class economically.
[00:08:12] We never owned a home.
[00:08:14] We always lived in an apartment building.
[00:08:17] My father was an immigrant from Japan.
[00:08:20] My mother was her family from Japan.
[00:08:24] But she was actually born in Madison, Wisconsin.
[00:08:28] And so my grandparents lived with us.
[00:08:31] We all three generations in the same apartment.
[00:08:36] I never felt poor.
[00:08:38] Because we had a strong family.
[00:08:42] Our church was only three blocks away from our apartment building.
[00:08:47] Every Sunday, we put on our Sunday best clothes.
[00:08:50] And we would walk as a family to church.
[00:08:53] Now it's interesting.
[00:08:54] You said your dad had immigrated from Japan.
[00:08:56] And your mom was born in Wisconsin.
[00:08:59] Was your mom not, didn't your mom get put in the internment camps with her family during World War II?
[00:09:04] No, no, no.
[00:09:05] Here's the thing.
[00:09:07] My father came to the states in 1918.
[00:09:10] In fact, that was kind of a funny thing.
[00:09:13] He was going to sign up for World War I, which was still going on.
[00:09:18] But then it ended.
[00:09:20] So he couldn't sign up.
[00:09:23] And then when World War II hit, he was too old.
[00:09:26] And plus he was a Japanese.
[00:09:29] I don't know if you know this or not.
[00:09:30] Japanese could not become citizens.
[00:09:33] Naturalized citizens, that would be United States until 1952.
[00:09:39] And so he was still a Japanese citizen.
[00:09:46] But he was in Chicago.
[00:09:47] My family was in Chicago.
[00:09:49] My mother and father, my brother.
[00:09:51] I wasn't born, I was born during World War II.
[00:09:55] And so we didn't have to go to camp.
[00:09:59] Mostly, the 95% of Japanese Americans at that time, or anyone of Japanese descent, lived
[00:10:06] on the West Coast in California, Oregon, Washington State, Colorado.
[00:10:13] And so when the war hit, Pearl Harbor hit, President Roosevelt signed executive order
[00:10:20] 906-6, which called for the all people of Japanese descent to be evacuated from the West
[00:10:29] Coast and put in concentration camps in the inner part of the country.
[00:10:35] Basically, in deserted desert areas.
[00:10:39] And these camps, they, you, for, basically, refer to them as relocation centers.
[00:10:45] But they were really, my, you know, your standard concentration camp with Bob Boyre
[00:10:50] Offences, with machine guns facing in, not out.
[00:10:55] And people not being able to come and go as they placed.
[00:10:58] 130,000 people of Japanese descent were put in these camps.
[00:11:04] The two thirds of them were American citizens, not aliens.
[00:11:10] Okay.
[00:11:11] And no trials, no, no, the only crime that they committed was the, the color of their skin
[00:11:20] and their fact that they were of Japanese descent.
[00:11:24] And so did your family avoid that because they were in Chicago?
[00:11:28] Yeah, but they were only like three or four hundred of us in Chicago at the time.
[00:11:33] And we weren't considered a threat, but my other, the rest of my family, my grandparents,
[00:11:38] my mother's side and my cousins and aunts and uncles, they were all in California.
[00:11:45] And they all got evacuated.
[00:11:48] Just imagine this, you're, it's a Friday night and you got a knock on your door.
[00:11:53] Okay.
[00:11:54] It's the local FBI agent.
[00:11:56] And he says, on Monday morning, be at the corner of Washington and State Street,
[00:12:02] with two suitcases and the communication.
[00:12:07] Okay.
[00:12:08] And you, you know, you don't have time to do hardly anything.
[00:12:11] And you, you know, you go there and then you're put on a train.
[00:12:16] You don't know where you're going.
[00:12:18] And you wind up in the camp and you're there for three years.
[00:12:22] Okay.
[00:12:23] So, let's say you're your owner of a small business.
[00:12:27] You lose the business.
[00:12:29] You no longer have a job, right?
[00:12:31] So you can't pay your mortgage and things like they lost, they lost everything.
[00:12:37] And now you're 18, let's say you're 18 years old.
[00:12:40] Okay.
[00:12:41] And this happens to your family, right?
[00:12:42] And the local Army recruiter comes to the camp and says, I want you to go down if you're
[00:12:47] a country.
[00:12:49] You know, frankly, Jocco, I don't know what I would have done.
[00:12:53] I might have told the guy to take a walk, you know, or you use other words.
[00:12:57] And yet, it's so many of them joined up.
[00:12:59] Absolutely.
[00:13:00] So, the 100th Patan in the 442nd.
[00:13:03] Regimental Conventing.
[00:13:04] That's right.
[00:13:05] And those guys fought with incredible bravery and had some critical battles that turned
[00:13:12] some, the tied and some critical situations as well.
[00:13:15] Yeah, they were the most highly decorated infantry unit in the history of the United States
[00:13:19] Army for its size and time of service.
[00:13:23] And they were a regimental combat team.
[00:13:25] Let's say about 4,500 soldiers because they had a, and are totally battalion and
[00:13:30] other things they were attached.
[00:13:32] Okay?
[00:13:33] In about 18 months of combat, they were awarded over 9,000 purple hearts.
[00:13:39] Some guys had 3 or 4, you know, and if not more.
[00:13:44] And, you know, the presidential unit citation, you're familiar with that award.
[00:13:50] There are Army divisions that never got that award.
[00:13:53] Okay?
[00:13:54] That regimental combat team was awarded 8 presidential unit citations.
[00:13:59] That's unbelievable.
[00:14:00] Yeah, they were my personal heroes.
[00:14:02] So that's, and that was to kind of get back to your question.
[00:14:05] That was one of the reasons that I wanted to join you Army.
[00:14:11] I was actually going to ask that.
[00:14:13] So, you know, you're sitting here saying, if you were in one of those camps, you don't
[00:14:15] know if you might have to tell them to go take a walk.
[00:14:18] But when your time came, you walked into the recruiters office.
[00:14:23] Not away from it.
[00:14:24] Yeah.
[00:14:25] Well, in my case, when I was in a country, I was in a country.
[00:14:29] In high school, as I told you, you know, a faith is a very strong part of my whole life.
[00:14:36] I've been so blessed in life, beyond anything I deserve.
[00:14:42] And so when I was our church, you know, we go to church every Sunday.
[00:14:46] I was in the choir.
[00:14:48] I was in cup scouts.
[00:14:50] I was in boy scouts.
[00:14:52] I was in the youth group.
[00:14:53] You know, all of this was centered around the church.
[00:14:56] You know, when I was in scouts, I went to the National Jam.
[00:14:59] I was in the library in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania with 52,000 of my best friends living
[00:15:05] in tents.
[00:15:07] But you know, that was, and what was the symbol of that jambri.
[00:15:12] George Washington at Valley Forge, kneeling in prayer.
[00:15:17] And the motto of scouting is for God and country.
[00:15:20] So that was really my motto.
[00:15:22] And then I was in a boy state.
[00:15:24] Are you familiar with boy state?
[00:15:26] No.
[00:15:27] The state is an American Legion program.
[00:15:30] Does it still exist?
[00:15:31] Yes.
[00:15:32] Yes.
[00:15:33] And it's been around probably for 50 years.
[00:15:36] Now, when I went, it was the 2050.
[00:15:38] Okay.
[00:15:39] So it's more than 50 years.
[00:15:40] And the concept of the boy state is they take junior, high school juniors, ready to go
[00:15:45] into senior year.
[00:15:48] And who are leaders, basically.
[00:15:52] And they form a quasi state government for two weeks.
[00:15:57] And they actually divide into two political parties.
[00:16:00] They don't call them Republicans.
[00:16:01] They request they call them something else.
[00:16:03] And they have state government, county government, and local city government.
[00:16:11] And you run for offices.
[00:16:13] And you actually have to come up with a platform and you debate.
[00:16:18] And so it's a lessen in civics.
[00:16:22] But it was sponsored by the American Legion.
[00:16:25] So we all lived in like dorms.
[00:16:27] And the dorms, we had to make our beds.
[00:16:29] So you could bounce a quarter on it.
[00:16:32] They were all army blankets, stuff, and cats.
[00:16:35] But it was wonderful.
[00:16:36] It was just a great experience.
[00:16:39] So when I was in high school, I was very active in my church.
[00:16:45] I'm kind of a German guy.
[00:16:48] And I was a president of my high school youth group at the church.
[00:16:54] And then I became the vice president of the Chicago Association.
[00:16:58] Did you play sports?
[00:17:00] No.
[00:17:01] Well, I was, no, I didn't.
[00:17:02] I was.
[00:17:03] And what about your grades?
[00:17:05] I was, I was Bell.
[00:17:06] I was too.
[00:17:07] It was my, of my grandma school and high school.
[00:17:10] And I was.
[00:17:11] They have valedictory and grammar school?
[00:17:12] Yeah.
[00:17:13] That shows you where how well I did in grammar school.
[00:17:15] I didn't even know that.
[00:17:16] And then I, I, I was in the band.
[00:17:19] I played clarinet and saxophone.
[00:17:21] So I was the first chair clarinet of the band.
[00:17:23] That was the principal woodwind in New Yorkous Dron.
[00:17:27] And so, but anyway, I was very active in my church youth group.
[00:17:32] And I was thinking of becoming a minister.
[00:17:35] Okay.
[00:17:36] But then I was in junior ROTC.
[00:17:39] And Chicago has the nation's largest junior ROTC program.
[00:17:44] About 30 high schools have it.
[00:17:46] And it's a great program.
[00:17:48] People misunderstand JROTC.
[00:17:50] They think it's a feeder for the military.
[00:17:53] Okay.
[00:17:54] I mean, some of them do go into the military.
[00:17:56] But that's not the purpose.
[00:17:58] The purpose is to give these high school students something other than gangs to belong to,
[00:18:05] to give them experience and leadership and discipline and teamwork.
[00:18:12] And it's a tremendous program.
[00:18:14] So I was in junior ROTC.
[00:18:16] Was, so it's that combined with your view of the, like the 442.
[00:18:24] Those things are kind of starting to congeal in your head and maybe move you towards a military.
[00:18:30] Yeah.
[00:18:31] And then in addition to that, I have just one sibling in older brother.
[00:18:35] He's about seven years older than I am.
[00:18:37] And he joined the army as an enlisted guy.
[00:18:41] But in the first year of college, he was in a military fraternity called Pershing Rifles,
[00:18:48] which other people like Colin Powell and some others have been in, including myself.
[00:18:53] When I went to the U of I.
[00:18:56] And you have to understand also that I'm Japanese American.
[00:19:01] In the Japanese culture, the warrior, the samurai, is at the top of the social strata.
[00:19:09] Unlike China, where the scholar was at the top in Japan, it's the warrior.
[00:19:15] So when I joined the military, when I became a commission officer, my dad was so proud,
[00:19:22] his small t-shirts swallowed the large.
[00:19:26] And when I became a general, it's like incredible.
[00:19:33] But I, so I want to do ROTC in college as a country.
[00:19:39] Yes, oh yes, I'm a driven guy, right?
[00:19:43] And I was, here's the thing though, as I told you, I was thinking becoming a minister.
[00:19:49] But then I also wanted to serve in the military.
[00:19:52] So what do you think I would do?
[00:19:54] Jappin?
[00:19:55] Jappin.
[00:19:56] It's a little problem.
[00:19:58] I'm Protestant.
[00:19:59] And my denomination, theologically, went so far away from what I believed in, that I couldn't
[00:20:08] buy the theology.
[00:20:10] So now I'm praying to God, right?
[00:20:12] And I'm saying, I get the message, I guess you want me to do my military thing.
[00:20:17] So that's what I did.
[00:20:19] Okay?
[00:20:20] But you fast forward, 50 years, 55 years.
[00:20:23] What am I doing today?
[00:20:25] I'm doing what I wanted to do when I was in high school, because I have military outreach
[00:20:29] USA, faith, faith, non-profit that I started.
[00:20:32] So it's a lesson in prayer.
[00:20:35] And that is, at that time, I thought God was telling me no.
[00:20:39] He wasn't telling me no.
[00:20:42] He was saying, wait, it's on my schedule.
[00:20:45] Not on your schedule.
[00:20:46] I mean, you know, I wasn't mature enough either as a military guy, nor as in my faith.
[00:20:52] So what year was it that you're showing up in college?
[00:20:56] 61.
[00:20:57] 61 started.
[00:20:58] So you do four years of college, it's 1965.
[00:21:01] Right.
[00:21:02] And I'm as really not escalated yet at that point.
[00:21:07] But did you think it was pretty hot at that time?
[00:21:09] And I basically, by that time, I was on the military thing, right?
[00:21:15] I wasn't going to be a champion anymore.
[00:21:17] So I was, I was in Persian rifles.
[00:21:20] I was on the rifle team.
[00:21:22] I was on the drill team.
[00:21:23] You know, if it smelled military, I was in.
[00:21:26] Okay?
[00:21:27] And then you have to remember, I had four years of high school, ROTC.
[00:21:30] Also before I went to Bennings.
[00:21:32] You're pretty good at your drill.
[00:21:34] I take it.
[00:21:35] I had.
[00:21:36] I mean, infantry, I OBC, infantry officers, basic course, peace of cave.
[00:21:41] I mean, I went through that.
[00:21:42] I was an honor graduate, my class.
[00:21:45] And in fact, this is really funny.
[00:21:46] My class, about 200 brand new, second lieutenant's, right?
[00:21:51] About a third of it was a national guard, about a third were reserves.
[00:21:57] And there were only a few of us that were regular Army.
[00:21:59] You see, I got a distinguished military graduate commission, regular Army infantry, right?
[00:22:05] And so very few of us were regular Army in my class.
[00:22:09] So our attitude was not really the best.
[00:22:11] Shall we say?
[00:22:12] And so we get the Benny.
[00:22:15] And they marched us to class.
[00:22:17] I mean, this was in, to us it was insane.
[00:22:20] We're second lieutenant's.
[00:22:22] This tell us where the building is.
[00:22:23] We'll get there, right?
[00:22:24] No, we had the march in formation.
[00:22:26] The army.
[00:22:27] So needless to say, the attitude was not real good with my company.
[00:22:32] So the day we graduated, they used to have a award, a streamer, that companies could put
[00:22:39] on their guide on.
[00:22:40] Those called the Tiger Tactics Award.
[00:22:43] This was really gung-ho companies, which ours was not needless to say.
[00:22:49] Well, the night before we stole or fumbling on their company.
[00:22:53] We put it on our guide on, so I'm graduation day.
[00:22:57] We march by the headquarters.
[00:22:59] And outcomes the commander, the guys live it.
[00:23:01] And you say, where do you guys get that?
[00:23:03] Oh, you know, it's just just a period.
[00:23:08] And we were graduating.
[00:23:09] That was the guy going to do to us, right?
[00:23:10] So we all graduated and that was it.
[00:23:13] So 1965, then you went to graduate school.
[00:23:19] Yeah, here's the thing.
[00:23:23] You know, I told you, we didn't have a lot of money for me to go to college.
[00:23:28] So I knew I had to earn it myself, right?
[00:23:31] So when I was in high school, on my senior year, I worked 33 hours a week.
[00:23:38] I worked from five till 10 o'clock at night at a warehouse in Chicago.
[00:23:43] And I worked eight hours on Saturday.
[00:23:46] So I could raise money.
[00:23:47] Okay, I also played in two bands.
[00:23:48] I told you I played for an atoness saxophone.
[00:23:51] I played in a Polish band for weddings.
[00:23:55] And that was so cool because by the third set, everybody was so blasted.
[00:23:58] Nobody cared.
[00:23:59] Right.
[00:24:00] And then by also played in a Jewish band.
[00:24:03] So I used to play for Barnetsvys.
[00:24:05] So I knew all the temples in Chicago.
[00:24:07] So I used to tell people, I had them coming.
[00:24:09] You're the way.
[00:24:11] And then I had to, you know, I took out two government loans.
[00:24:14] And that's the only way I could afford to go to school.
[00:24:18] And so 65 rules around.
[00:24:20] I graduated.
[00:24:21] And I find this interesting for a real obvious reason.
[00:24:25] You majored in English in college.
[00:24:28] Yeah, the reason I did that, Choco, was once again,
[00:24:31] you know, I'm pretty focused guy in my focus was on becoming
[00:24:37] the best officer I could be, the best leader I could be
[00:24:40] of infantry soldiers.
[00:24:42] And I knew I was going into combat, right?
[00:24:45] So as a freshman, I tried to determine,
[00:24:48] what am I going to major into preparing me for that.
[00:24:51] So I looked at psychology and I looked at English, not rhetoric,
[00:24:57] but English literature.
[00:24:59] I rejected psychology in my first year,
[00:25:01] because we had these classes with Pavlov and his dogs
[00:25:06] and all this stuff.
[00:25:07] And I was going through that and I said,
[00:25:09] what does this have to do with people?
[00:25:11] You know, I mean, I want to learn how to work with people.
[00:25:15] Well, literature, whether you read
[00:25:17] the whole continuum of every man or Shakespeare
[00:25:21] or Hemingway, if you read that stuff,
[00:25:25] there are universal traits of human nature that come out at you.
[00:25:29] And if you can understand it, you can realize
[00:25:32] what motivates people.
[00:25:34] Okay, so I, and then not only that,
[00:25:36] but if you read the best writers of all time,
[00:25:40] I just felt by sure us Moses,
[00:25:42] God, not the smartest guy, just by sure us Moses,
[00:25:46] I could absorb that and I could express myself better.
[00:25:49] So that's why I made you an English.
[00:25:51] And I've talked about that.
[00:25:52] I was an English major as well.
[00:25:53] And I was, I was, I was prior and listed.
[00:25:57] So I had been in for eight years and actually
[00:26:00] I'd been in for 10 years by the time I went to college
[00:26:03] and I knew right away I was going to be an English major
[00:26:06] and the reason I wanted to be an English major,
[00:26:07] because I had gotten commissioned and served two years
[00:26:09] in the in the seals before I went to college as an officer.
[00:26:13] And I realized you got to write everything.
[00:26:15] You got to read directives from people
[00:26:17] and you got to understand what they're saying.
[00:26:18] And then you got to communicate with your troops.
[00:26:20] And I wanted to do have a good command of the English language.
[00:26:23] The, the part that you talked about,
[00:26:25] the understanding of human nature was something
[00:26:27] that I saw once I got in and I started reading it.
[00:26:30] I started applying and thinking about what I was reading.
[00:26:32] And now this is something that I,
[00:26:34] that I advocate for everyone.
[00:26:36] To, if you want to really understand human nature,
[00:26:38] you got to read.
[00:26:39] Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:41] So I was, so when I was reading.
[00:26:43] What is your reading?
[00:26:45] You know, when I said that in 1965,
[00:26:48] the war, because I, what was it?
[00:26:50] What year was I drank?
[00:26:51] That was 1965, wasn't it?
[00:26:53] The battle of I drink.
[00:26:56] I think it was.
[00:26:57] I think it was 1965.
[00:27:00] I think it was.
[00:27:01] And you know, they kind of used that as,
[00:27:03] hey, this is when the real escalation started.
[00:27:06] And the reason I asked you that specifically is,
[00:27:09] because I've had some Vietnam vets on that were going to college in 1965.
[00:27:12] And they were like, they didn't even,
[00:27:13] hadn't even heard of Vietnam.
[00:27:14] At that point.
[00:27:15] So I guess it was because I was in ROTC,
[00:27:19] you know, I was kind of paying more attention.
[00:27:21] Yeah.
[00:27:22] And I knew I was going to the Benny.
[00:27:24] I mean, that was, four gone conclusion.
[00:27:26] And you knew you were going to combat as well.
[00:27:27] Oh yeah.
[00:27:28] That was your mind.
[00:27:29] Yeah, because that was my goal.
[00:27:31] Being infantry officers.
[00:27:33] You know, I mean, if I did, you know,
[00:27:34] that's, that to me was where I wanted to go.
[00:27:38] And so in 65, I got an offer to get an assistantship,
[00:27:45] you know, to be really a counselor in the dorm.
[00:27:50] But it's like I died and went to heaven
[00:27:51] because they paid for tuition and fees.
[00:27:55] And I got like a hundred bucks a month salary.
[00:27:57] Which to me was like,
[00:27:58] British guy in the world.
[00:27:59] Yeah, you know.
[00:28:00] But the important thing was I could get my master's degree.
[00:28:04] Okay. And by the way, I got it in a year.
[00:28:06] Because I went to summer school.
[00:28:08] And I just, I'm on the go on active duty.
[00:28:10] But this was a chance for me to go, you know,
[00:28:13] under the citizenship and not have to pay for it.
[00:28:16] But now the pragmatism kicks in for me.
[00:28:19] You know, because, you know, really with the name
[00:28:21] which degree, as you know, you know, it's great for preparing
[00:28:25] you to understand things.
[00:28:28] But, you know, that in 50 cents in those days
[00:28:32] will get me a cup of coffee.
[00:28:34] So I, and that, I knew I was going to go into combat.
[00:28:38] I knew I was going to be an infantry officer.
[00:28:40] And the odds of my perhaps getting wounded, you know,
[00:28:44] were fairly decent.
[00:28:46] So I needed to have a fallback, you know.
[00:28:49] And I wasn't in a count.
[00:28:50] And so I wasn't a CPA or, you know, something like that.
[00:28:53] So I got my masters in the teaching of social studies.
[00:28:57] So I could be a teacher.
[00:28:58] And, you know, you don't have to run the hundred yard dash
[00:29:00] to be a teacher.
[00:29:01] And so, and I, and teaching is a noble profession.
[00:29:04] And I always felt that, you know, it's something I could do
[00:29:09] if I got wounded and still contribute to society.
[00:29:13] And 70, or, you know, the 75% of your time
[00:29:16] is an officer or senior NCO is teaching.
[00:29:20] You know, so I figured I want to find out how to
[00:29:22] pro-stue it, allegedly.
[00:29:25] What I found out is the military has the best education
[00:29:28] system really does.
[00:29:30] You know, I didn't have to get my masters at green and history
[00:29:33] and philosophy of education at psych and all that stuff.
[00:29:37] No, didn't need it.
[00:29:39] So you wrap up, you get your masters degree.
[00:29:42] And now you know you're going to Vietnam.
[00:29:44] What happens is that when you graduate?
[00:29:46] Okay, so I go to Fort Bunny.
[00:29:48] I go to I OBC.
[00:29:49] I'm, you know, I'm an honor graduate with my class.
[00:29:51] So I didn't finish that story.
[00:29:53] This might, my, my class that I was in, you know, really bad
[00:29:57] attitude guys, right?
[00:29:59] And the day of graduation, they announced the honor graduates.
[00:30:03] Okay, I was in the third platoon.
[00:30:04] So first platoon, they announced the honor graduates in the platoon.
[00:30:08] Second platoon, they announced the honor graduates third platoon,
[00:30:12] which I am in.
[00:30:14] I'm the only guy who's an honor graduate out of my platoon.
[00:30:17] When they announced my name, everybody boo.
[00:30:21] Because I ruin our record right?
[00:30:24] So what happened is I volunteered for, I volunteered for,
[00:30:28] well, I was regular army.
[00:30:30] So I had to go airborne.
[00:30:32] I volunteered for Ranger school, but in those days, the West Pointers,
[00:30:36] all of those mandatory, they had to go to Ranger school.
[00:30:39] So I graduated the same time that the West Pointers did.
[00:30:43] They took up all the quotas.
[00:30:45] So I, I didn't, I couldn't get into Ranger school,
[00:30:48] but I had a solution.
[00:30:49] See, I'm always thinking, I was gonna,
[00:30:51] I applied for Pathfinder school.
[00:30:54] So I figured I'd go through Pathfinder school.
[00:30:56] I'd finish that.
[00:30:58] The West Pointers would be gone.
[00:30:59] I could slide into the next Ranger class, right?
[00:31:02] They didn't give me Pathfinder.
[00:31:04] So now I'm stuck, right?
[00:31:05] So I said, okay, I'm volunteering for Vietnam.
[00:31:09] And they sent me to Korea.
[00:31:11] So I was in the DMZ in Korea, which is really a god thing.
[00:31:15] I've gotta tell you this, because I was with the second ID
[00:31:18] on the DMZ and those days, you were assigned,
[00:31:21] and you stayed there for 13 months on the DMZ.
[00:31:24] And there was still active combat patrolling in...
[00:31:27] Oh, yeah.
[00:31:28] We'd take casualties during that time period.
[00:31:30] 13 months, I was there.
[00:31:32] We had 12KIA in about 40 wounded.
[00:31:35] Okay, so this was not a walk in the park.
[00:31:38] And it was a great experience for me,
[00:31:41] because in addition to, see, we were in the DMZ.
[00:31:44] We actually had a company compound, okay?
[00:31:48] And we actually had a guard mount, you know,
[00:31:51] and we had our own NCO club and we had,
[00:31:54] and so we had all the BS of the admin stuff
[00:31:58] that you do when you're in Gerson.
[00:32:01] But we were doing combat patrolling every day on the DMZ.
[00:32:05] So it was really a great experience for me as a young officer,
[00:32:09] because I was able to lead troops out on patrol.
[00:32:13] But also I had to do all this admin stuff, you know, the Gerson.
[00:32:18] And so that was your Patoon Commander tour.
[00:32:21] What were the patrols like? What were you doing?
[00:32:23] Basically, they were ambush patrols,
[00:32:26] because the DMZ was set up
[00:32:29] where it was a free fire zone.
[00:32:32] If you saw anyone, you could shoot them,
[00:32:34] because nobody was supposed to be there, okay?
[00:32:37] And we would have to say Korean Chongqing,
[00:32:40] which is telling the stop, you know,
[00:32:43] but how many times did you say that before you pulled the trigger?
[00:32:46] Basically, but we did ambush patroling primarily.
[00:32:51] And that was, you said you were lucky,
[00:32:54] or you said it was God that put you there.
[00:32:56] And you feel that because that's just a really good sort of warm-up for combat.
[00:33:02] Absolutely. That's absolutely.
[00:33:04] I feel that way. My first deployment to Iraq was relatively.
[00:33:09] It was relatively easy, right?
[00:33:11] We were in a bad dad. Things were going pretty well.
[00:33:15] We had the upper hand on the enemy,
[00:33:16] and we didn't get into too much major combat.
[00:33:21] You know, we got a few fire fights here and there,
[00:33:22] but wasn't like when I got from body.
[00:33:25] I felt like that, I was real blessed to have had an experience
[00:33:30] where you get the kind of the initial nervousness out of your system
[00:33:34] and you realize, okay, I can do this.
[00:33:35] That was, I felt pretty lucky about that.
[00:33:38] Well, also, you know, keeping mine up is just a young,
[00:33:41] second-leaf ton of shaved tail, what did I know? Really.
[00:33:44] And I was once again blessed, I had a platoon sergeant
[00:33:48] who really, even as a Korean war veteran.
[00:33:51] Oh, wow.
[00:33:51] You know, God was actually in E7, okay?
[00:33:54] And basically, when I got there, you know,
[00:33:57] I was his lieutenant.
[00:33:59] Okay, so nobody screwed around with me,
[00:34:02] but on the other hand, I listened.
[00:34:03] We all carefully.
[00:34:05] That's one thing I learned.
[00:34:07] You know, as a young officer,
[00:34:10] I've had my success in the military
[00:34:14] because I had great NCOs who made me look good.
[00:34:19] And I had commanders who mentored me
[00:34:21] and didn't cut my head off when I screwed up.
[00:34:23] And I made my first share of mistakes.
[00:34:25] Yeah, but we all, you get done with that tour.
[00:34:28] And then what's your next assignment?
[00:34:30] So, you know, you get your dream sheet, right?
[00:34:33] A lot of where you want to go when you do a row,
[00:34:35] so when you leave that area.
[00:34:37] And so I put in for Fort Brake, for Fort Benning,
[00:34:41] because I'm on the go to a narrow point unit,
[00:34:42] because I was airborne, but I had never served in a narrow point unit, right?
[00:34:45] They sent me to Fort Lewis Washington.
[00:34:47] So I go to Fort Lewis Washington to the training center,
[00:34:53] infantry training center, okay?
[00:34:56] And when I get there, I made a long story short
[00:35:01] when I was in Korea.
[00:35:03] I also was, they found out I had a master's degree,
[00:35:06] so they pulled me off the line.
[00:35:09] And the battalion commander calls me into his office, right?
[00:35:12] So I go down there and he says,
[00:35:15] do you tell them what we are going to do?
[00:35:17] How are you doing?
[00:35:19] Sir, I'm having a great time.
[00:35:21] I'm with soldiers, we're doing combat patrol lane.
[00:35:27] And I really, and this is what I've been trained to do.
[00:35:32] And he's, so I'm happy.
[00:35:35] So he says, I see you have a master's degree.
[00:35:37] I said, yes, sir.
[00:35:40] And he said, our battalion accident is leaving.
[00:35:44] And you have a degree in English.
[00:35:48] You can see where this is going, right?
[00:35:50] And I said, yes, sir, and he said, well,
[00:35:52] how would you like to be the battalion accident?
[00:35:56] And I said, sir, I'm honored that you would even
[00:35:59] consider this, but I'm really happy, you know,
[00:36:03] leading soldiers.
[00:36:04] And he said, do you tell him I'm not looking for a
[00:36:07] hapiness in my battalion?
[00:36:09] You will report on Monday morning, yes, sir.
[00:36:13] So off I went, and I became the battalion to
[00:36:17] accident.
[00:36:17] But that once again was a great experience for me,
[00:36:20] because I learned a lot of the admin stuff.
[00:36:25] And unfortunately, and some, I also saw some bad stuff going on,
[00:36:29] which I was not happy with.
[00:36:31] I saw, you know, because obviously,
[00:36:34] accident, what I didn't tell you was, that was that battalion level.
[00:36:39] The brigade accident left, and they called me up to brigade to be the brigade.
[00:36:44] And I'm a first lieutenant.
[00:36:45] That's a major position, right?
[00:36:48] But I happen to be pretty good.
[00:36:50] And I was the best battalion accident, not all the
[00:36:53] battalions.
[00:36:54] So I go up there, I go up there to brigade to be the brigade accident.
[00:36:59] And what I found was, you know, the officer efficiency
[00:37:03] reports and the OERs, I knew all the battalion commanders,
[00:37:07] because I dealt with them all.
[00:37:09] So if I Jim Moquayama were to rate the battalion commanders
[00:37:14] based on their leadership, right?
[00:37:18] And I would have rated them one, two, three, four.
[00:37:22] But I saw the reports going through, it was four, three, two, one.
[00:37:26] And that's because they were looking for managers,
[00:37:30] not commanders.
[00:37:33] And so that was, that was a tough,
[00:37:36] until the swallow.
[00:37:37] So I opening for you as a young man.
[00:37:39] Yeah.
[00:37:40] Yeah.
[00:37:40] Yeah.
[00:37:40] I know when I worked, I was the admiral's aide.
[00:37:41] And I saw, I didn't see stuff like that turned me off.
[00:37:46] But I saw, I just just getting a better grip on what was happening
[00:37:49] behind the scenes was very important for me,
[00:37:52] and it helped me out, you know, later on.
[00:37:57] And when you were in Fort Lewis, that's when you first met Hacourt, right?
[00:38:01] Absolutely correct.
[00:38:03] This was so cool when, when, when,
[00:38:06] now I'm a captain, by this time I'm a captain, right?
[00:38:10] And I'm at the, I'm the secretary general of the,
[00:38:16] of SGS.
[00:38:19] I was the secretary of the general staff, okay?
[00:38:22] What that means is obviously a system for the chief of staff,
[00:38:25] basically.
[00:38:26] And so, yeah.
[00:38:28] Do you know who Hacourt was?
[00:38:30] Oh, okay.
[00:38:31] We all, we all, I mean, Hacourt's a legend, you know,
[00:38:35] everybody knew who he was, but also because I had that job,
[00:38:39] one of my functions was, I was the guy who coordinated the general schedule,
[00:38:44] and the chief of SGS schedule.
[00:38:46] And Hacourt was reporting into Fort Lewis as a new battalion commander, okay?
[00:38:52] Well, whenever a new battalion commander came in,
[00:38:55] I always did research on the person, you know, so I could tell the general,
[00:39:00] you know, here's the guy who's coming, here's his background,
[00:39:02] well, Hacourt's was.
[00:39:04] You know, Mr. Infantry, basically.
[00:39:07] And so when he came to see the general, he walks into the headquarters,
[00:39:11] you know, I'm sitting behind his desk, he walks in,
[00:39:14] so I stand up, you know, I say welcome Colonel Hacourt to Fort Lewis,
[00:39:18] you know, the general will be with you in 10 minutes, you know,
[00:39:20] because he came early, right?
[00:39:22] The first words out of Hacourt's mouth,
[00:39:25] I'm not kidding.
[00:39:26] First words, what are you doing sitting behind the desk?
[00:39:30] He said you should have a company.
[00:39:33] He said if you want one, I'll give it to you, okay?
[00:39:37] The guy doesn't know me from Adam, right?
[00:39:39] I mean, you know, but, you know, it was pretty sharp in the way of warming,
[00:39:44] you know, for my did have, you know, my jump wings and my E, I have an
[00:39:48] expert infantryman's badge, okay?
[00:39:50] And I had my E, I'd be, that's it.
[00:39:53] I didn't wear any ribbons or A to stuff, and just the stuff that counted.
[00:39:57] As far as I was concerned.
[00:39:59] And so Hac sought that, you know, and I said, Colonel, I really appreciate, you know,
[00:40:04] what you're saying, but I came to the same conclusion that you did a couple months ago,
[00:40:09] and I've already talked to a battalion commander who's accepted me to take one of his companies.
[00:40:17] So I'm committed to him, so I can't, you know, I'd love to take you up on your offer,
[00:40:22] but I can't, because I committed to the Southern Battalion commander.
[00:40:25] And Hac said I understand totally, okay?
[00:40:28] Well, that turned out to be another kind of thing, because later on, as you know, in the book,
[00:40:33] he and I got together and we saved the career of a drill sergeant.
[00:40:37] Mm-hmm.
[00:40:37] We, I just want to hear a little bit more about this, because it's something that I haven't
[00:40:43] been able to gather from anyone.
[00:40:46] You know, in my mind, you know, I thought everyone must look at Hac like,
[00:40:51] you know, this guy's Mr. Infantry as you put it, but I also would say to myself,
[00:40:55] well, you know, here's like, I'm thinking that because he wrote these books, and because I studied him,
[00:40:59] but that was an actual thing. People knew who he was by his reputation throughout the army.
[00:41:06] Yeah, it was not only his reputation, but his appearance.
[00:41:10] I mean, you know, his neck was probably the size of my waist.
[00:41:14] I mean, this, you know, Hac worth was just, you know, he always said,
[00:41:18] you know, he wasn't bald like today, you know, but you know,
[00:41:23] eighth of an inch, you know, razor sharp, you know, sides and all that.
[00:41:27] And what I didn't say is when he, Hac worth had this unique ability to size people up when he saw them.
[00:41:35] Like when he said that to me, and, and I've said this before, but Hac worth,
[00:41:41] his philosophy was, you're either a dud or a stud.
[00:41:45] And there was nothing in between.
[00:41:48] And he had this uncanny, I've seen it dozens of times where he actually did size guys up.
[00:41:56] And I never saw him this, on that evaluation.
[00:42:00] He just had this, this instinct, you know, the size guys up.
[00:42:04] And that's, and that's why he was successful as a commander because one of the principles is the
[00:42:10] surround yourself with good people. And so when he came to a unit, he found some guys that were
[00:42:17] cutting it, they were gone. I mean, especially in combat, you know, he can't tolerate that,
[00:42:22] you know, and he would, and he had the strings that he could pull.
[00:42:26] And he had the relationships all over the place that seems.
[00:42:29] That's right. Now, how did, when did he leave with to go to Vietnam and take over the battalion?
[00:42:35] He, he probably let the sea, I left in May of 69. So it was probably end of 68 or maybe
[00:42:44] early 69. And, and he goes over, and he's over there for a few months. And then he ends up needing,
[00:42:51] well, he wants to surround himself with good people again. And so he reaches out to you.
[00:42:55] Yeah, how does that happen? Well, you know, I, I was still at Lewis as an AIT company commander.
[00:43:06] And another thing I should tell you at that time, I'm not real happy with the army because they never
[00:43:13] gave me any assignment or anything I ever asked for. Yeah, you're like, oh, for for it this point.
[00:43:19] Well, wait, are you ready for this? I, I get what I didn't tell you was in graduate school. I majored
[00:43:24] in Japanese history and Chinese history and political science and Japanese language in my masters of
[00:43:32] social studies. Okay. And I happened to be Japanese American. I happened to had a tour in Korea, right?
[00:43:40] We're, by the way, I didn't tell you, I got some awards from the Korean army. And so now the army
[00:43:47] comes out with the foreign area specialty training program or fast. Okay. And the concept was a great
[00:43:55] concept, you know, in Vietnam, we got caught with our pants down because we didn't have any army experts
[00:44:00] in Vietnam. Nobody knew the culture, nobody knew the language, the politics, sound familiar. And so
[00:44:07] basically, the army said, okay, we're going to develop geographic experts for the whole world.
[00:44:14] Okay. And we're going to call it the fast program. So I saw that and it was in the army times.
[00:44:21] You know, they said, you have an interest called this number, you know, and so I called,
[00:44:25] you know, and he said, hey, look, pull up my record, you know, you'll see, you know, I'm,
[00:44:30] I've got my masters degree in Fari Senefers. Ethnicly, I'm Japanese. I've got a tour in Korea
[00:44:39] where I got some awards from the Korean army. Okay. And I'm regular army. Right. What are my
[00:44:48] chances of getting in this program? They should be 100% right? Are you ready for this? The first
[00:44:54] words out of their guy's mouth. You haven't been to Vietnam. And I said, well, that's right,
[00:45:01] but if you go back in my record, you'll see, I volunteered for Vietnam. In the army sent me to Korea.
[00:45:08] Okay. He said that doesn't count. Okay. The second thing he said was you haven't been the career
[00:45:14] course advance course or officer. He got me there. I hadn't, you know, I was just a young captain.
[00:45:19] I hadn't been there. So in essence, he's telling me, you know, come back in a couple of years
[00:45:24] and maybe we'll think about it. You know, he didn't give me any encouragement. He didn't say,
[00:45:30] hey, you're a natural for this program. You know, I'll keep on monitoring your career,
[00:45:34] you know, he didn't do any of that stuff. And about that time, I got the letter from Hankworth saying,
[00:45:40] hey, move, we got a war going on. If you want a company at yours, and like, I hit the lotto,
[00:45:46] you know, and frankly, I was, I was thinking of, you know, resigning my regular army commission,
[00:45:52] but I hadn't been to Vietnam yet. And I was a bachelor. I had a lot of my friends who were married
[00:45:58] or going back for their second and third tours, you know, and I felt an object. And then I don't know
[00:46:03] you that, but I figured, well, maybe if I go, I'll change my mind, you know, and serving on your
[00:46:09] hand course would be the best opportunity I could have. So I jumped at it, you know, and I went,
[00:46:14] but things did not happen. How did you get orders? I mean, you know, I know hack worth had some
[00:46:20] relationships with people, but just to get a guy deployed to be in his battalion, how did you
[00:46:25] put, how did he pull that off? What did it look like? Well, I mean, I, I called my infantry officer
[00:46:30] assignment guy, whom I never spoken to in the five years I was on active duty, right? Because I
[00:46:36] always felt that I shouldn't be managing my own career, you know, and if I, if I did my job,
[00:46:44] that the army would, you know, I, I'd be treated, okay, you know, well, none of that ever happened,
[00:46:49] right? So I called the sky at the Pentagon and I say, hey, I'm volunteering for Vietnam again,
[00:46:54] and he basically said, well, okay, you know, give me your phone number, in case we lose connection
[00:47:02] here, and, and then he said, and I said, but I have a stipulation, I need to go to the night division,
[00:47:09] and he said, okay, I can make that happen. When do you want to go? I said, as soon as possible,
[00:47:15] and this is February, and he said, why can get you there in August? And I said, nope, that's not
[00:47:21] soon enough. He said, how about April? I said, sold. So I got orders to, you know, now everybody told
[00:47:27] me in the world at that time, here I am, infantry regular army captain going to Vietnam. When I hit
[00:47:35] the repo depot, they could assign me anywhere. You know, and the orders meant nothing, you know,
[00:47:41] because captain's infantry captain's were a dime a dozen. So when I get to Vietnam,
[00:47:48] everything was Greece, night division. I went from the night, I went from from, from Saigon,
[00:47:56] right to the night division at Dong Tam. You know, I landed there, I got my orders to his battalion.
[00:48:02] It's all all Greece. What you doing some kind of like Vietnam indoctrination for a week long
[00:48:08] and hack pulled you out two days into it or something? Yeah, I was so upset. They had a five day
[00:48:15] in country training program for newbies, okay? Especially, you know, in the Delta,
[00:48:24] I'd say 85% of our casualties were from booby traps. And so we were, and there was a special
[00:48:32] terrain, you know, with rice paddies and, and a canals and, you know, just the whole thing was totally
[00:48:39] different. And so they had this five day training course to acclimate you and to understand the booby traps
[00:48:46] and the terrain and all this stuff. And I'm in it for two days and I'm pulled out of the course.
[00:48:51] And I put on a helicopter and they take me down to, you know, the battalion fire support base
[00:48:57] and I'm mattered in the wet hen. You know, and I go to half and I say, sir, you know, how can
[00:49:02] you do this to me? I mean, I'm trying to learn how to stay alive, you know, so I can, and he said,
[00:49:08] moke, you don't need that stuff. I know you, you know, yes, sir, yes, sir, I have.
[00:49:13] And when you showed up, so for those of you that hadn't read, haven't read the books or listened to
[00:49:17] the other podcasts about this, hack worth it showed up. But he was requested by name to go and take
[00:49:22] over the 439th and Vietnam, which was a, which was a battalion that was having a lot of problems.
[00:49:28] And he went in there and he fixed it. I mean, that's, there's no, simple way to put it. He went in there
[00:49:34] and squared that battalion away and made them from hopeless to hardcore is the terms that get used.
[00:49:42] When you showed up, the heat already been there for a while, so things were pretty solid at that point.
[00:49:47] Oh, they were, they were so good. It was incredible. In fact, the first guy I met when I, when I got
[00:49:53] there was our battalion this forward, his name was Mario Takahashi. He was actually a national guard guy from Hawaii.
[00:50:02] He was about six, two or six, three big Japanese guy. You know, not like me.
[00:50:07] The tall was hack worth.
[00:50:10] Yeah, of course.
[00:50:11] Because you just, you made it sound when you said the talking about his neck, was he like a
[00:50:14] bait because he, in pictures, he always looks pretty lean and, and not very physically large.
[00:50:20] Well, when I, I mean, he was, he was stout. Okay. I mean, he wasn't, he wasn't real, he was
[00:50:25] in real tall, but just the way he carried himself. That's what I always envisioned was he was just
[00:50:32] a guy that if you walked away, go, I bet that. You know, how tall was hack worth? Oh, he's six eight.
[00:50:37] Yeah. You know, when you find out he's whatever five enters. And not only that, but I'll tell you.
[00:50:42] He, when I became a general later on in life and, and he came to one of my, every, every year,
[00:50:49] I used to have a leadership conference for my, my officers and my NCOs that I would invite speakers
[00:50:56] to come to. And hack worth came to one of my conferences and then he visited me in Chicago
[00:51:03] when he was doing his, about face book, right? And so he invited me in my wife and kids to
[00:51:11] have dinner with him one night. You know, he always said, bring your kids, you know, some guys
[00:51:16] would say, no, just, you know, bring your wife or whatever, because my kids were fairly young,
[00:51:21] and then we're really young, they were maybe eight or nine, you know, at that time. And my wife
[00:51:27] and the kids actually commented about how soft spoken Hamworth was. He wasn't a blustery guy.
[00:51:37] You know, among guys, yeah, but, you know, in the, in public with, you know, women and family
[00:51:43] members, he was, he was a gentleman, which kind of surprised my wife because I told him well about,
[00:51:52] and so, but that's, that's how he was. And, and so the, the, the battalion you show up, it's just,
[00:52:01] the guys are really on board with what's going on. Oh, absolutely, because I got there
[00:52:07] probably three weeks before our, our famous, but it wasn't really a battle on 22 May, where we
[00:52:16] decimated a VC training battalion basically. And I remember being at the talk, you know,
[00:52:27] when he's planning on this hack, where it's had this innate quality, get just smell out the enemy,
[00:52:33] you know, even with all the intelligence we get and all this stuff, you know, he was able to
[00:52:38] figure out what they were doing. And so he, he set us up for that night, but to answer to you,
[00:52:45] dress with you, or saying, by the time I got there, talk on Hashie was the first guy in that, okay,
[00:52:50] he was really a strong, straight student and he was the S4. And so he got all the equipment for
[00:52:57] the battalion and he got it, whatever way he had to get it, you know. And then I meet the next guy,
[00:53:03] me, is another, is a company commander. And that guy was like six, three or something, you know,
[00:53:08] so I'm seeing a pattern here, right? And I'm five foot five, okay? And but here's a cool thing about
[00:53:14] this, one of the other company commanders, his name was Don Meyer. And by the way, hackers
[00:53:20] had this really cool way of of using words and terms and titles that, you know, like our
[00:53:29] companies were not Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta. They were alert, battle, claim, or and dagger, okay?
[00:53:37] And the claim or a company commander was a guy by name, a Don Meyer's. Don Meyer's was my roommate
[00:53:45] in college at the University of Illinois. And we both were infantry, our OTC guys, right? And then later,
[00:53:53] he was, he was with the hundred and first and he was wounded, so they shook them to the Simmons.
[00:54:00] And then they assigned him the Fort Lewis, which was where hackworth and I were. So Don and I were
[00:54:06] roommates again for Lewis Washington, okay? So then hackworth ships to be at none and he takes
[00:54:13] Myers with him, okay? So no Myers, who, by the way, is six foot three, right? And this nickname was
[00:54:20] Lank. And when he and I were in college as roommates, it was like mutton Jeff, you know?
[00:54:26] And I wasn't the tall guy. And so anyway, but as you, as you can understand, to have,
[00:54:33] I commanded battle company and he commanded claim or company. And I knew that if we were going to
[00:54:41] run into any cramp, you know, that he would, he would be there for me. And he knew I would be there for
[00:54:47] him. And that was, that was, it just, it was really good. Yeah, that whole thing with names is
[00:54:56] something that I completely ripped off from hackworth when I was a task unit commander, our task
[00:55:02] unit was called, whether it was Alpha Bravo and Charlie and I had Bravo and immediately when I
[00:55:07] took it over, I changed the name from Bravo to Bruser. And that's was that changed the attitude
[00:55:13] of people. It really does. Well, I also, as you know, all elite units have, have greetings and
[00:55:19] counter signs, right? So for the hardcore, our, our model was hardcore recondo, that was what the
[00:55:27] greeting was. The countersign, which I cannot say totally was no effing slack. Okay. Yeah.
[00:55:36] But I'll tell you, there were guys, I saw this, I witnessed this. There were guys who were wounded
[00:55:41] on stretchers. And hackers would walk up to them and they'd salute them and say hardcore recondo.
[00:55:50] What kind of missions did you do when you showed up there? So you take over your company commander?
[00:55:56] Yeah, they were, they were, they were just really reconsurge and disdrew. I'm not really
[00:56:04] destroyed, but you know, we were, we were seeking out the VC, but as it got closer to, we know we were
[00:56:13] leaving, right? Because President Nixon had said that, you know. So it just got to be, you know,
[00:56:21] we kind of the area, make sure they weren't there. If they were there, we get into firefight
[00:56:24] so that didn't happen very often. It was mostly booby traps and things. And basically, that was it,
[00:56:33] because they, you know, they're smart. They knew we were leaving. So why go and, why get into contact?
[00:56:40] Right. You're leaving. Now you, you were showing me some pictures earlier. You're,
[00:56:46] pretty famous picture that got published. It's, someone, uh, your, your RTO had just been wounded.
[00:56:52] What was the story on that? Yeah, this is one of our operations and there was a booby trap and,
[00:56:57] and he was, uh, he got a sucking chest wound from it and, and I got a little shrapnel, not a lot.
[00:57:04] And, uh, basically, I called in a MetaVat helicopter and the helicopter came in and unbeknownst to us.
[00:57:11] There was a UPI photographer on the helicopter and he snapped a picture of my guy's carrying
[00:57:20] my wounded RTO on a structure towards the helicopter. And that became like the UPI
[00:57:26] picture for the day that went around the world. You know, the Vietnam photograph. I didn't even
[00:57:31] know to exist until three years later. I was out. I was off and back to duty. I was reading
[00:57:36] on U.S. News and World Report magazine and the picture was like three inches by four inches
[00:57:41] in the magazine. But it was all my soldiers, you know, and I saw it and I said, hey, and then I saw
[00:57:46] I was in the picture. So I'm kind of, in the picture so you can see me. So, uh, I got the photo
[00:57:53] from them. I get asked a lot and it's something that I don't have any experience with
[00:57:59] is what it was like having drafties as, you know, I was in all volunteer military and then on top of
[00:58:06] that, you know, the unit I worked with, we were all volunteered again. You know, you volunteer to
[00:58:11] come in the new volunteer again to try and be in the seal teams and people ask what it was like
[00:58:16] working with drafties. Now, hackworth's opinion was drafties were good because they didn't care
[00:58:22] about their career and if they thought something was wrong, they'd say, hey, this is crap. We don't
[00:58:26] want to do that or hey, you're not telling the truth to us. And so he thought it was good and it kept
[00:58:31] the army in check. But there's still how to be some leadership differences in dealing with an
[00:58:38] and later in your career. Obviously, you started working with the all volunteer army. What did you
[00:58:41] notice about the drafties that you learned from? Well, the drafties just like, and it doesn't
[00:58:49] make any difference or your drafties or or volunteers. It depends on the leadership and, you know,
[00:58:56] they'll respond the good leadership and the drafties were like anyone else. Once you're in the position,
[00:59:06] you're going to do the best you can, especially when you're in combat because you want to survive.
[00:59:11] And by that time it gets to be a bonding thing. You're not there fighting for liberty and just
[00:59:17] this in the American way. You're fighting for the guide to the right of you and the guide to the
[00:59:22] left of you, basically. Because you're every day you're living together, you're dying together,
[00:59:27] you know, and so it's a function of leadership and the drafties were great guys. I mean,
[00:59:34] I'd serve with them anywhere. In fact, I didn't even know who was stranded. I didn't care. I didn't ask
[00:59:40] you know, whether there are drafties or volunteers, although the vast majority of our guys were
[00:59:45] drafties in the fourth or the 39th. And that's what was so cool about it that hackers could take
[00:59:52] that Italian and turn it around. And I heard stories because I came later on, you know, but he had
[00:59:58] a price on and said initially. Yeah, a price on his head from his own guys. Yeah, well, yeah,
[01:00:04] but nobody had the gonads to step up and clean the, clean the price. So yeah, I mean, one of the things
[01:00:11] he talks about and again, I've talked about this on another podcast, but you know, when he showed
[01:00:15] up, everyone had whatever they had guitars and they had radios and they had, you know, big
[01:00:20] hammocks for themselves and he got there and said, okay, anything that you can't carry on your back
[01:00:25] is going to be in the middle of our base tomorrow morning. It's getting shipped out on helicopters.
[01:00:29] So people went crazy. Are you kidding me? Well, not only that. You don't what he did. I'm true. You know
[01:00:34] this, but he took away class A meals. Oh, I did not know that or I don't remember it because
[01:00:39] there was so, they were so, how to say this nicely. They, they were not disciplined. Okay.
[01:00:49] They had lousy leadership before that and, uh, Hackworth basically said, you know, you guys are soldiers
[01:00:56] and he said, I'm going to keep you alive, you know, but you're going to have to soldier. So he actually
[01:01:02] took class A's away and initially he made them shine their boots and they're like, I mean,
[01:01:07] you know, stuff that sounds crazy. Yeah. You know, but he was getting their attention. Yeah. You know,
[01:01:13] and cleaning weapons. I mean, they would, you know, they were not cleaning. I mean, how crazy is that?
[01:01:18] They were cleaning their weapons. At nighttime there was night discipline. Light discipline was
[01:01:24] almost non-existent. I mean, it was crazy. And Hackworth made them, you know, soldier up and
[01:01:29] and, and, uh, but then what happened was, uh, they started to use his tactics and they found out
[01:01:37] that, hey, this works. I mean, we're not taking casualties like we did before. We're actually
[01:01:43] inflicting casualties that we weren't doing before. And then he started to give stuff back.
[01:01:51] Oh, you know what else he did? He took away beer. I mean, beer was like water. I mean,
[01:01:58] you know, the average temperature was like 95 degrees, you know, and all that. And it was like
[01:02:04] three point two. Whatever the beer was, you know, but he took that away initially too. And people thought he was
[01:02:10] nuts. Yeah. Actually, there's a great quote in about face. It's some guy right in home to us.
[01:02:15] It's just a quote from a letter. Somebody wrote out wrote, you know, my new company, my new
[01:02:19] betelian commander's crazy. I don't know what's going to happen. That's literally a letter or a guy
[01:02:23] right home. It's interesting to me. So I've seen this and I'm sure you've seen this in your career.
[01:02:30] I've seen it in the business world. I'm sure you've seen the business world in the military.
[01:02:35] Guys that go so far in that direction of being so hardcore and over the top that they break
[01:02:42] their guys and people don't actually like them and they don't want to serve them and they don't
[01:02:48] want to do good job because they're too focused on stuff that doesn't really matter. And
[01:02:54] hack was just, he seemed to have this ability to balance it so well between being hardcore and yet
[01:03:01] at the same time, everybody knows that he's going to take care of many loves him.
[01:03:05] Yeah. That was the main thing because they knew that they were going to, they were going to
[01:03:11] live under his command if they followed what he said. And there would be successful too.
[01:03:17] Don't forget that success breeds success. And so the hardcore is they kept on progressing.
[01:03:27] He became prouder and prouder of, you know, in the guys. It was just a unit that nobody wanted
[01:03:35] to reckon with. And that's how it was. But hack led by example, I can't, I just can't emphasize
[01:03:42] that enough. You know, I have my leadership mantra which, you know, I'm a simple guy. So I boil
[01:03:51] the boil things down simply. And it's a three words example, carrying and balance.
[01:03:58] And you got to lead by personal example. It's not, you know, do what I say, but do what I do.
[01:04:04] And carrying is the care for your soldiers. And, you know, carrying means, especially in combat,
[01:04:14] keeping them alive. That's how you care for them. And you train tough. You know, I mean,
[01:04:20] hack worth always mentioned that, you know, the harder you train, you know, the better the
[01:04:25] delperform and combat. In fact, sometimes it was easier in combat than, you know, some of the training
[01:04:31] that he'd make them go through. And, and finally, is balance to, especially leaders. And I'm
[01:04:37] talking to leaders, right? And I always told my leaders that you've got to maintain a balance between
[01:04:45] your professional, military job and your family. And I used to tell my guys, you're not doing
[01:04:54] many good if you're going through a divorce. You know, and too many guys, it's easy when you get
[01:04:59] promoted to get kind of caught up in the perks and in the responsibility, you know, see you work
[01:05:06] harder to be more, and then what do you do? You ignore your family. And then things fall apart.
[01:05:12] And so I, I warned my soldiers. I always said, you know, maintain that balance. And I tried to do
[01:05:19] that not only personally, but to get my, so when we were mobilized, for example, okay, my division.
[01:05:25] Now, this was not, we didn't deploy overseas. We were a training division. Our wartime mission
[01:05:33] was the Army reserves, by the way, was the only service that had this. We, we had reservist,
[01:05:39] whose wartime mission was to take over the training of the recruits at the active duty stations,
[01:05:45] which would then release those active duty soldiers to go join forces. It made a lot of sense, you know.
[01:05:52] So, so when that happened, I, I went to my staff. Now, you have to understand, this is like the
[01:06:00] late 80s, right? Okay? And I went to my staff and I said, I want a 24 hour, 800 number
[01:06:11] from my family support program. I want my soldiers to know, and I want their spouses to know
[01:06:17] that while they're deployed, if there's any problems, they can count on us. And I want it to be
[01:06:25] 24-7, man. And they said, General, you have to understand those, they's 800 numbers were pretty expensive.
[01:06:30] And, and they said, you know, number one is going to be expensive. Number two, you know, 24-7,
[01:06:37] you know, and I said, make it happen. Because I, I, the last thing I wanted my soldiers who were
[01:06:43] deployed to worry about was their families, right? And then what I did is I, I had the two-star
[01:06:51] stationery, you know, as, as a major general, little notes, you know, they're not eight and a half by 11.
[01:06:56] They're little note things. So I told my staff, I want to send a personally signed note to every
[01:07:05] spouse or significant other of the Floyd soldier in this division. And I'm on a note to go
[01:07:13] to their employer, because you have to understand these are reservists, right? Okay? So I had 1500 soldiers
[01:07:22] mobilized, right? So this is 3,000 letters that I'm going to sign, you know, personally. They
[01:07:28] wanted me to use an auto, auto pen, you know, by computer, you know, manufacturer, your signature.
[01:07:35] I said, no way, these are, these are going, you know. So I, I did that. And what happened was,
[01:07:41] I was, I had a cousin whose husband was a steel seal salesman, okay? And she calls me in
[01:07:49] the day. She said, you'll never know what happened to my husband. He was making a call on this company
[01:07:54] in Indiana, okay? And on the wall was one of my letters. You know, very cool to them. And he saw
[01:08:01] my name on it, you know. So caring for your caring and balance is important. Yeah, yeah, you know,
[01:08:15] you talked about that, that operation that was so well planned and so well executed. And you
[01:08:21] talked about hack words, sort of six cents instinct. And then, you know, I've heard you talk
[01:08:31] in some other interviews about a situation that you were in. That was that you described as really
[01:08:39] sort of impacting your your mental state. And to me, when I heard you talk about it,
[01:08:47] it seemed to be almost like a turning point mentally, psychologically for you. And I had to do with
[01:08:54] you overrunning a position and you end up with some some. Yeah, I didn't realize the impact of that
[01:09:01] incident until many, many years later. But in order for me to explain that, I have to talk about something
[01:09:09] called moral injury, which is when they so called invisible wounds of war. A lot of people are
[01:09:18] familiar with post-traumatic stress disorder. A lot of people are aware of traumatic brain injury.
[01:09:26] But when you asked them that they could describe the invisible wound of war called moral injury,
[01:09:32] very few people are knowledgeable about that. How long has that term been used?
[01:09:37] There was a psychiatrist at the VA, Dr. Jonathan Shey, who basically coined that phrase in 2009.
[01:09:48] So it's been around for a while. And now it's starting to really pick up steam in research
[01:09:55] because of its significance in contributing to the high suicide rate, among veterans.
[01:10:05] And the concept is, when I go around and I give presentations and I tell people, the concept is so
[01:10:14] intuitive, you'll get it in 30 seconds. Okay, so here it is. From the time you're born until you're 18
[01:10:21] years old, you develop a personal moral code, sense of right or wrong. That could come from your
[01:10:27] family, your religion, community, friends, whatever. And then you join the military and you learn
[01:10:35] a warrior code. The warrior code is superimposed on your personal moral code and in fact transforms
[01:10:43] it somewhat. Then you might have to participate in activities or operations that violate your
[01:10:49] personal moral code, such as killing. You don't have to be the person that pulls the trigger.
[01:10:56] You could be a witness or you could feel that you should have prevented it or you could be
[01:11:03] in a unit to follow another unit and you see that innocent civilians have been killed or you
[01:11:09] handle body parts. At that time you sustained a so-called invisible wound of war called moral injury.
[01:11:17] It's not a physical wound. You can't see it. But in military operations, we're constantly moving.
[01:11:23] You're going from point A to point B to point C. You don't have time to stop and reflect on this
[01:11:29] stuff. So what do you do? You bury it. And it becomes unresolved grief, shame, and what happens is
[01:11:40] you come back to the states and let's say you leave the military or you're in the national guard
[01:11:46] or reserves and you come back to a community anywhere in the country that doesn't understand what
[01:11:53] you've been through and it boils up to the surface. And unless you have a strong coping mechanism
[01:12:00] for that bad stuff happens, anger, guilt, depression, suicide. And the suicide rate among
[01:12:08] veterans today is epidemic. I mean the VA is anywhere from 20 to 22 veterans per day are dying
[01:12:15] by suicide and that frankly is under-reported. It's really higher than that because you've got
[01:12:21] veterans who are dying by suicide is not reported as a suicide. Though drive their motorcycle or
[01:12:29] car into a tree or by duct and it's a vehicular accident or unfortunately there's something
[01:12:37] called suicide by cop where they force the law enforcement officer to take lethal action.
[01:12:44] And so what's the implication of all that? We lose more veterans to suicide in a year than all
[01:12:50] the combat dust since 9-11. That's how dramatic it is. And we believe that moral injury is a major
[01:12:58] contributing factor to that. And military outreach USA, our organization, we feel that the main
[01:13:06] approach to moral injury is not a medical doctor with prescription drugs. It's the forgiveness
[01:13:14] and grace of a moral authority and the counseling of clergy and sensitive therapists and the
[01:13:23] support of a community offering hope and help. And so now getting back to that incident that
[01:13:29] you asked me about, Jockel, I was a company commander battle company. We had just overrun
[01:13:36] a vehicle composition and killed numerous enemies and I literally had three dead bodies sent my feet.
[01:13:45] Well, the time the unit is most vulnerable is right after a victory. It's just human nature to let
[01:13:52] your guard down and breathe the side relief. When the guy in charge, I know that. So I'm on my radio
[01:13:59] and I'm kicking rear end and taking names. I'm telling my platoon leaders, reorganize your units,
[01:14:06] redistribute ammunition, take care of your wounded, look for enemy avenues of approach for a counterattack,
[01:14:13] right? And in the middle of all that stuff going on, I stopped. And I looked at the three dead bodies
[01:14:21] at my feet. I realized that something had happened to me, something had hardened my heart,
[01:14:28] only moments earlier, these were alive human beings. They had families, they had emotions,
[01:14:36] they had loved ones, they were fighting for something as important to them as I was fighting for.
[01:14:43] And I was in their backyard. And then I remember Jesus' sermon on the Mount,
[01:14:48] we told us to pray for our enemies. So in the midst of all this stuff going on,
[01:14:53] I set up prayer for the three be at Kong. And I know I was praying for myself, this much as I was
[01:15:01] praying for them. Now, I didn't have a big ceremony, get on my hands and knees, any of that stuff.
[01:15:08] You know, this all took about 45 seconds. But it's something that was seared in my heart and mind
[01:15:14] for the rest of my life. And now that I know about moral injury, which I didn't know at that time,
[01:15:21] I realized that I was one and a million who was able to address my moral injury at the time that happened.
[01:15:32] And you know, I had always, when I came back from Vietnam, I had seen a lot of my comrades
[01:15:38] having nightmares, having flashbacks, personality changes, and I frankly asked myself,
[01:15:45] how come I'm not going through that? Okay. And at the time, my answer always was my faith,
[01:15:52] and my wife, my wonderful wife. Of now 46 years, who is an angel. I've been so blessed
[01:16:01] having her for a wife. So that was my answer, okay. But now, since I've been dealing with military
[01:16:07] outreach USA and this issue of moral injury, I realized that my answer was really lacking.
[01:16:13] Okay. There were two other things. One was that incident in Vietnam that I just mentioned to you.
[01:16:20] But the other thing, which I now realized is when I came back from Vietnam, I joined the reserves.
[01:16:27] Okay. And I was able to maintain my sense of purpose
[01:16:35] of being in an unit with other people who shared the same values that I did, of patriotism,
[01:16:42] of dedication, of selfless service, which a lot of veterans, when they come back, they just want
[01:16:49] to cut ties totally and they a lot of them drift because they don't have that sense of purpose.
[01:16:57] They don't have the camaraderie, they don't have the bonding. I had that with the reserveers,
[01:17:03] especially with Vietnam and all the BS that we had to take from the public.
[01:17:09] You won't believe this, but I know you know this. But when we came back from Vietnam,
[01:17:15] we were told not to wear our uniforms in public. That's how bad it was.
[01:17:20] That's crazy. You know, guys wore wigs so people wouldn't know they had short haircuts
[01:17:27] because they could pick them up as being military. And so my being in the reserves helped me
[01:17:34] maintain that. One of the things that I tell guys is very similar to what you just said.
[01:17:43] You know, I tell guys you got to find a new mission when you get done. When you get done with the military,
[01:17:46] you got to find a new mission. And if you can stay in the reserves, obviously, that gives you that.
[01:17:50] But if you don't do that, well, then you got to find what are you going to do? What are you going to
[01:17:54] step out there? Are you going to become a great dad? Are you going to build a business? Are you going
[01:17:58] to work for a company and do a great job? Or you got to find a new mission? And I find that
[01:18:02] guys that I've seen that have real problems, it's because they got out and they didn't have
[01:18:08] any direction to go into. And also just to dig a little bit deeper. So you're in that situation
[01:18:15] where you see these guys and for the first time you kind of look down on them and see them as
[01:18:22] people as other human beings. Is it, you know, is it the fact that you, when you set a prayer for them
[01:18:31] and for yourself, I kind of got a thought of when you hear about like Native Americans hunting.
[01:18:39] And you know, they, they think, you know, when they get a kill, they'll, they'll think
[01:18:44] that mother nature and and thank for the sacrifice. Was it that type of thing where you said,
[01:18:51] okay, you know what we're fighting? I was doing my job. You guys were doing your job.
[01:18:56] And I hope you have peace now. Was it that type of thing? Absolutely. Because, you know,
[01:19:05] what happens is you forget that they're, they're dehumanized. But you know, you've got all these,
[01:19:13] all these names that you call them. You know, but I really respected the VC, our enemy. You know,
[01:19:22] that's the other thing. You can't underestimate your enemy. You always have to respect them.
[01:19:30] You have, you know, I mean, you don't have to agree with them, but you, you have to respect
[01:19:35] their abilities. Because once you lose track of that, you can really get screwed. And basically,
[01:19:43] I'll give you some examples. When we had that battle on 22 May, okay, I wasn't the CNC
[01:19:49] helicopter with. And I guess I should describe that battle a little bit more so you're listeners.
[01:19:54] We're talking about the hardcore battalion. And when we surround this, this VC training battalion
[01:20:03] really is what it was. And we annihilated it basically. They were, they were encircled. And we were
[01:20:09] just calling her in air strikes. Naval gunfire, you know, we were just taking, and then
[01:20:15] hackworth had him totally encircled. And so I'll never forget I was in the helicopter with him.
[01:20:21] And he basically said, MOOC, we got a, first we get a radio message from one of our companies.
[01:20:29] It might have been an alert company. And they said, we just had a contact, you know, we killed three,
[01:20:34] we've kept, you know, we got four weapons, we captured a guy or whatever. And they're headed
[01:20:39] in this direction, okay? So hackworth would turn to me and say MOOC, you know, let's say,
[01:20:45] given 15 minutes, we're going to hear from battle company. 15 minutes later, battle company comes
[01:20:51] up. We just had a contact, you know, and they're heading, so this happened all day. Okay, I saw this.
[01:20:58] I was with him in the helicopter. And, but there was one VC, we were flying near a canal.
[01:21:05] And he was mortally wounded. You could see the guy was dying, basically. He took his AK 47
[01:21:11] and he threw it into the canal. Okay? And the reason he did that is he didn't want us to get that weapon.
[01:21:23] Because part of the body count was you matched how many weapons. You know, if a unit reported
[01:21:30] and they said, well, we killed 20 and we got one weapon, you kind of say, wait a second.
[01:21:35] You know, so when I saw that, I knew that this guy, you know, we were up against the tough enemy.
[01:21:43] You know, and so you got to respect your enemy and
[01:21:51] I want to pull some before we move past the Vietnam and hack. I want to pull some stuff out of about
[01:21:56] face just to kind of hear your thoughts on it. I'm going to start off with one that you've talked
[01:22:04] about a little bit, but here we go. This is from about face by David Hackworth and this is a quote
[01:22:09] from someone else. It says, hack had the knack of being able to size people up very quickly,
[01:22:15] almost instantaneously. And I'd say 99% of the time he was right. He could look at a person and
[01:22:21] in his vernacular, the guy was either a stud or he wasn't. There was no in between.
[01:22:27] If he was a stud, hack would find a way to get him. And he would not take no from people.
[01:22:33] If he wanted them because he wanted a winning team. And if a person didn't want to go with him,
[01:22:40] then immediately the guy wasn't a stud. You see, because anybody who knew hack or came into contact
[01:22:47] with him really wanted to be with him after he'd known him for a while. And that's a quote from
[01:22:53] Brigadier General James H. Mookayama, which is you. Okay. You're quoted in the book. And you've
[01:23:01] talked about that a little bit. And he just had, he must have extremely magnetic personality.
[01:23:07] For you to say that if you spent time with him, you wanted to be with him. Oh, absolutely. And
[01:23:11] he, I used to say he had the mightest touch. Everything the guy touched. Just whether it was in the
[01:23:18] military, whether it was in business, whether it was with women, in this guy, he was a stud himself.
[01:23:26] And, you know, and, but he was, he was also a sensitive guy. I'll never forget when, you know,
[01:23:35] I tell people he wasn't the most moral guy that I knew. But he was the the most ethical officer
[01:23:44] I ever served with. What I mean by that is he never did anything for personal gain. He always
[01:23:52] did things for the unit and for the soldiers. Okay. But did he have affairs and things like that?
[01:23:59] Yeah. And he used to tell me he said, Mook, you know, I should have never married because my
[01:24:06] loved this the army. You know, so he, he basically, he turned on the war college. He could have
[01:24:12] gone to the war college. He turned it down because he said, hey, I'm on another battalion and be at
[01:24:18] now. You know, I mean, he would have been a general. There's no question about it. He had he not stood
[01:24:24] off, you know, when he was no six and, and, you know, he, I think he was the youngest O-6 at that time
[01:24:32] in the army. But he was a guy who, who was, he was sensitive though and he took care. He did take
[01:24:40] care of his family. In fact, I can say this now because it's, you know, I think statue limitations
[01:24:45] might be gone. But, you know, in those days, you weren't, you weren't able to take a lot of cash out of
[01:24:50] Vietnam, you know, and, and I basically, one day, he knew I was going back home. Oh, and by the way,
[01:24:58] he did everything he could that convinced me to stay and to extend in Vietnam. Okay. He was,
[01:25:04] he had moved down to be the senior advisors for the Arvan Airborne Division, which was really the
[01:25:12] Palo scarter around Saigon. Okay. And he knew all my hot buttons. You have to understand,
[01:25:17] I was a bachelor. Okay. This time, right? And, and, and the airborne, the Vietnamese airborne
[01:25:25] wore special fatigues. They were like tiger fatigues and they had red burays. You know, and I'm
[01:25:32] just this young stud guy who likes their uniforms. And he said, Mook, he said, why don't you come
[01:25:38] down here and I'll make you the G1 advisor. That's the admin guy, right? And he said, but when you
[01:25:46] come down, if you're an advisor for the Vietnamese airborne, you get jump-a. You know, so that's
[01:25:51] extra money, right? And, and he said, and I'll give you two Arvan ours. You, because he knew I,
[01:25:59] I wanted to go to Japan and see my relatives. So in six months, he said, I'll give you two Arvan
[01:26:04] ours, right? So guys, you know, he's trying to move the, you know, the sun in the moon, they
[01:26:09] get me to extend six months. And, and I said, sir, I appreciated it, but I had some close calls.
[01:26:16] And I figured the next one would have Mook, Yam, or Ritten, that bullet would have Mook, Yam,
[01:26:21] or Ritten, and I said, no thanks, you know, I appreciate it. But I'm out of here. So,
[01:26:27] I love him. You know, you're talking about the way he was, you know, so, so pro army, and yet,
[01:26:39] he would have be able to against the army in a way. And here's another thing from the book.
[01:26:45] He says, what a mistake it was to listen to the generals of corporate HQ who were briefed only
[01:26:52] in zero defect terms, and so far from the cutting edge, expected nothing less. It was amongst
[01:27:00] the biggest mistakes of the war. The politicians only listen to these generals and the generals
[01:27:07] only listen to themselves. Few people asked front line soldiers, the only ones who really knew.
[01:27:16] Could you guys, or could you, could you a pretty close to him, could you sense that
[01:27:25] his frustration with the army? Did he talk about it with you? Did he, how did he treat?
[01:27:30] You know, that's a very hard thing for a leader to do. If you're, if you're senior leadership,
[01:27:34] is telling you to do stuff that doesn't make sense or, but, you know, hey, we can get it done,
[01:27:39] and we're going to do it. It's a hard line to walk to say, look, we support the chain.
[01:27:43] Come on, this is what they're telling us to do. I'm going to spin it in a positive way. Everyone's
[01:27:46] going to think that we're doing it for the right reasons, because if I say, hey, look,
[01:27:49] move, here's what I want you to do, and it's, it's dumb, but we're getting told to do it anyways.
[01:27:53] That's not a good way to lead. No. So he wouldn't say that. So he would, he would support the chain,
[01:27:58] and he would, he would present it in the way in which, you know, he'd talk about the mission,
[01:28:08] and he would make sure that he would accomplish the mission, but he would do it his way.
[01:28:17] You know, you know, the phrase battlefield expediency. That's what we did all the time. You know,
[01:28:22] I mean, it's good. What, you know, what are they going to do? Send us to Vietnam. We're already there.
[01:28:27] You know, so, you know, we just did what we had to do. And, you know, I mean,
[01:28:32] the stupid rules of engagement that we had, you know, where do you have to get approval to fire
[01:28:38] on people, even though you're receiving fire, you know, and just nutty stuff, you know,
[01:28:44] and we just say, hey, you know, we're going to do what we have to do. And that's what we did.
[01:28:51] Here's when he, uh, when he took over the battalion, the following day,
[01:28:55] took over the battalion from Lieutenant Colonel Franklin A. Hartle in a parade field exchange of command
[01:29:01] in the middle of the Maycon Delta, what kind of war have I got myself into? I wondered.
[01:29:05] A perfectly starched general, you was there having flown in for the occasion in his polished
[01:29:10] choppers. There was other brass, too, and photographers, the American flag, the battalion,
[01:29:15] colors, which were ceremoniously passed on to me. And all of this before the scrimgiest,
[01:29:20] most spirulist assembly of soldiers I'd ever seen. Incredibly, none of the generals or
[01:29:26] kernels seem to notice the slack condition of my new charges or their positions.
[01:29:33] From the outset, I realized that to make this unit effective military force, I'd have to
[01:29:38] implement about a thousand changes. So I figured we'd start with five a day, little things,
[01:29:43] basic things like where your steel pot and cleaning carry your rifle at all times. And ammunition
[01:29:48] will not be worn poncho via style. My first order was that darkness that come darkness,
[01:29:55] the fire support base perimeter would pull back 300 meters. The troops instantly began to grumble
[01:30:00] about this. But it was the next order that really began the muteness feeling within my hard
[01:30:05] luck outfit. Anything you can't carry 24 hours a day is gone in the next chopper,
[01:30:10] chopper, good by tents and pots and rock socks and food lockers. The bitching and moaning began
[01:30:17] in earnest as piles and piles of junk mounted at the LZ to be whisked away by Chinook.
[01:30:22] But I didn't care. I wasn't there to have them like me. Again, we already talked about this.
[01:30:34] And this comes up a lot from a leadership perspective. Do you, is it more important?
[01:30:40] Do you like doors? It's more important to be respected? Is it more important to?
[01:30:44] And I actually had a guy ask me this question the other day. Is it more important to win
[01:30:48] order be liked? And I said, well, those two things aren't mutually exclusive at all.
[01:30:55] Right. You're absolutely correct. And they're not mutually exclusive.
[01:31:00] You know, if you demonstrate to your soldiers that you care for them professionally,
[01:31:09] that's you'll be liked. There's no question because they know that you're there for them.
[01:31:14] And you know, you don't as as it said there, you know, you're not there to win a popularity contest.
[01:31:22] You know, you're not there to be politically correct. You're there to accomplish your mission,
[01:31:27] but also make sure that your guys come back. And I think I'm starting to tie together
[01:31:34] something very clearly in my head right now. And that is, you're your number two rule of leadership,
[01:31:40] which is caring. And I think if you care about your people and they see that you care about them,
[01:31:48] that trumps the fact that you want them to do things the right way, because the reason you want them
[01:31:53] to do the things the right way is because you care about them and it's going to keep alive.
[01:31:57] Make you successful. Yeah, absolutely. You know, when I was a young officer, I,
[01:32:05] well, no, I, that's him. When I was a company, after half worth left, we had another
[01:32:12] battalion commander come in, right? And he wrote on my OER, all my career I had
[01:32:20] max OERs really good stuff. But on this one, he wrote that, and I'll take this hit any day
[01:32:28] the week. He said, I was too concerned for my troops sometimes. Wow. And then, and I said,
[01:32:38] okay, I'll take that. Wow. That's, that's an interesting perspective. Yeah.
[01:32:46] And, you know, this is one of those dichotomies as well, because one of the hardest things about being a
[01:32:52] leader is obviously you care about your men so much and yet you are going to do things. You are
[01:32:57] going to put them in situations that's going to put their lives at risks at risk. And that is
[01:33:02] that is something that every leader has to, will least military leaders they have to
[01:33:08] have to find a way to get a handle on that. Because you love your guys and you want to take
[01:33:13] care of them. But you do have to do your mission. And that, that's one of the hardest things
[01:33:19] to balance. Talking about the morality of war a little bit, this was a, and again, this is why,
[01:33:29] you know, the story that I opened up with, you can see that one clearly had to do with, with
[01:33:36] having moral dilemmas and having guilt because hackworth gave a guy an order and the guy
[01:33:41] followed the order, maybe not the way hackworth thought he was, but the moral injury that he got from
[01:33:46] that he said lasted his whole life of giving an order and somebody does something he didn't expect
[01:33:50] to do him the end of getting killed. One of his guys, one of his guys that he loved gets killed because
[01:33:55] of the way he led. Here's another kind of moral situation going back to the book.
[01:34:05] They're flying around, they're on a mission. We went down to about 100 feet. The suspects were
[01:34:11] still running, but this closer inspection confirmed my initial feeling. They were just eight kids,
[01:34:18] no older than 13 or 14, simply scared shitless as they ran looking for cover, carrying neither
[01:34:25] weapons nor military equipment. No, I told the pilot, I don't give you permission to fire. I'll
[01:34:32] put an infantry insert on them. I instructed the platoon leader who's men were aboard the four
[01:34:38] slicks where to land. With gunships covering the platoon hit the ground, the immediately received
[01:34:46] small arms fire and took a couple of wounded. The little kids were as my savvy pilot had said
[01:34:52] from the outset, the vehicle. It was a major lesson learned from me, but one impossible to
[01:34:59] etch in stone. I had a couple of men wounded who would not have been if I just said to blow those kids away.
[01:35:08] But I couldn't say blow them away because they appeared unarmed. Yes, they were VC,
[01:35:14] but they could just as well have been kids ditching school who happened to get caught in the
[01:35:19] crossfire. Anything was possible. And I suddenly realized it would not be easy this delta war.
[01:35:25] It wasn't easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys anywhere in South Vietnam,
[01:35:30] but here in the delta it was damn near impossible.
[01:35:39] Again, very similar to what my guys dealt with over in the body was very hard to tell
[01:35:45] who was good and who was bad and the enemy knew they could just put the you know drop the weapon
[01:35:49] and walk away and now they were considered innocent even though 20 seconds prior to that they were
[01:35:54] shooting. How did you keep your men from becoming so callous that they were just going to
[01:36:04] start shooting kids because they suspected they were VC. How hard did you have to keep control of that?
[01:36:11] Well, my response to that is the American soldier in Nate Lee is ethical.
[01:36:19] It's in our culture not to shoot women and children. Now guys, you know if there
[01:36:31] that might be something else, but we and we do not shoot civilians just
[01:36:41] you know who are who are caught with you know we we run across them just because they're there
[01:36:52] and we want to take revenge. We don't do that as an army. They're generally speaking. Now there are
[01:36:57] times when people lose it and I understand that that's the stress of war that's happened in all
[01:37:04] wars. I don't condone it but I can understand and so they answer your question. We really didn't
[01:37:15] have to our guys are pretty professional and I was proud to start with them. I didn't I didn't
[01:37:23] see any of that. Okay. Yeah, and this just tells me once again it's about leadership.
[01:37:29] I mean because here you can see hack clearly leaning towards making sure he's doing the right thing
[01:37:34] even though he's a guy that loves his troops and wants to take care of me. He still leans towards
[01:37:38] doing the right thing and from what you're saying that filtered all the way through the chain of
[01:37:42] command and we we took an in-depth look of actually done two podcasts concerning the Mealime
[01:37:48] Asker and what happened there and it was just so clear that the leadership was completely at fault
[01:37:55] and the way that they led those troops and it was when when I went through to try and pull
[01:38:01] something positive out of the Mealime Asker the positive message that I got from it was that
[01:38:08] it was one officer who had flown it was Thompson I believe his name was but he had flown over
[01:38:13] heat scene what was happening he flew back to base told the senior leadership this is what's going
[01:38:17] on in the ground the senior leadership radioed into the field and said stop killing people
[01:38:22] and they they literally instantly stopped they stopped the massacre just because a leader
[01:38:27] stepped up and said stop so good leadership completely changed the situation as it was ongoing
[01:38:34] and clearly if there would have been a better leader on the ground that was leading in the right
[01:38:38] way it never would have even started so you can see here from what Hacks saying the way he led
[01:38:45] and the way he treated unknown you know people and then the way that was carried out through the
[01:38:51] whole battalion that's another amazing testament to good leadership. Yeah and and once
[01:38:57] something about me lie which I tell people is that it was the exception to prove the rule
[01:39:03] that United States military that that was an exception. Oh yeah you know the the rule in our
[01:39:12] military as we don't we don't do that and that proved it I mean I didn't see you know there
[01:39:19] were other armies there who were more ruthless like the like the rocks the rocks were not there
[01:39:27] they were the Republic of Korea they were not there the wind the hearts and minds of the people
[01:39:31] they were there the wind the war so if they would go by a village and they were fired upon
[01:39:38] they destroyed the village and after a while nobody fired on the rocks.
[01:39:49] When Hacks worth now gets wounded in the eighth time. Yeah it was you I thought you were
[01:39:56] getting to that when you read that one quote but the way and I wasn't there with him when he
[01:40:02] when he got his ace purple heart but I know the story and and basically there were guys
[01:40:11] who were in in bad shape and he lands the CNC in the middle and fact that might have been that
[01:40:17] then maybe they they landed in the middle of a firefighter hacked it. He ordered the pilot to take
[01:40:24] him down and he does put the wounded guys into the CNC well the CNC isn't that big you know there's
[01:40:31] no room for heck so he stands on the skits and they take off and he gets hit in the lake and that
[01:40:38] was the z-purple heart well after that you know he could tell the guys in the battalion I want
[01:40:43] you to walk through this wall of fire and the response would be where do you want us to go you know
[01:40:49] he he led by example but is that what caused the army you say okay we're gonna
[01:40:57] did they pull did they pull them from the battalion at that point when he got his eight
[01:41:00] purple heart pretty much that was that was it because well if you got three purple hearts you
[01:41:04] went home was that was that the deal I don't know I only had one but I have no idea but you know they
[01:41:10] they basically said you know we can't afford the luge you I mean if they you know if you get killed I
[01:41:16] mean that's a big hit on just a morale and you know and so you're out of your out of there in the
[01:41:23] field okay so he went up to play crew to become the deputy he was the G3 core advisor for two core
[01:41:34] okay which was the central highlands and when my company was pulled out of Vietnam and I'd be
[01:41:40] fused to go and I said hey I want to stay here I called half and I said sir you know I don't really
[01:41:46] want to go back can you use me I had orders the next day to go to play crew and then you went
[01:41:53] up to play crew and you start you guys were doing advising for the yeah we we were the we were the
[01:42:00] Mac V that's a military assistance command Vietnam people and I had there was a close call that I had
[01:42:12] when this was another moral injury thing by the way which I really had really buried and not
[01:42:21] really thought a lot about it but we we had an inspection team that went out on the special forces
[01:42:29] camps on the border of Cambodia and Lowes and Vietnam and you had pleasure rain Ben had doctor
[01:42:38] in the central highlands and so we would fly into these camps and there were three people on this
[01:42:46] inspection team so to speak it was the deputy core advisor who was an o6 a full kernel you know
[01:42:53] big deal there was the command sergeant major highest ranking and listed advisor also a big deal
[01:43:00] and I was the young captain okay carrying everybody's bags no takers yeah right so so we land on
[01:43:07] this special forces camp and we come under attack and the sergeant major is killed and he was maybe
[01:43:17] 20 meters away from me it was a rocket and it was just he was in the wrong place you know it could have
[01:43:23] been me if I was you know if it had come in the other direction well the backside of that story
[01:43:31] is that he was scheduled to go on R and R the next day to Hawaii to meet his waiting wife
[01:43:40] to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary okay now I was just a young captain but I
[01:43:50] out ranked him okay I could have ordered him not to go on that mission why risk it you know
[01:43:59] because he he was going to meet his wife the next day I didn't do that okay and I I've thought about
[01:44:06] that in terms of survivor guilt and and all of that it was and that's something that's come up in my
[01:44:16] you know my studying this moral injury stuff. At this point did you you're so now you're
[01:44:25] working with hackworth directly and are you starting to sense his frustration about the war at all?
[01:44:34] Yeah a little bit yeah well no more than a little bit because the the G3 for the core was
[01:44:45] fairly corrupt guy and hackworth was very frustrated with that and that's why he loved actually
[01:44:54] well let's backtrack I yeah he he was moved down to the Vietnamese airborne because he really
[01:45:05] was not happy I think he might have been moved I never really got the story on that why he went down there
[01:45:13] and now at this point what's your what are you thinking about in your career in your life?
[01:45:18] Oh I already decided I was designing when I got back to the States and what made you what made you
[01:45:24] lean in that direction because I mean you did more years in JRTC than anyone I was ever done before
[01:45:31] that did you did RRTC and you had all that military stuff and now you got your combat torn Vietnam under
[01:45:37] what what tilted you in the other direction? I felt the army was going in the wrong direction
[01:45:43] when it came to leadership I thought that they were looking for managers and not commanders
[01:45:53] I was in some positions during my career right had access to officer deficiency reports
[01:46:02] and I could see were the ratings of the senior officers that lieutenant colonels and the
[01:46:09] battalion commanders were the tendency was to give the managers high ratings irrespective of their
[01:46:20] command abilities and and then my personal career was was not managed very well
[01:46:29] the hack worth hack worth wanted me to stay he knew I was I was thinking of resigning and the
[01:46:35] fact that's why he offered me the company because you know he thought that experience might turn
[01:46:39] things around you know and so I'm here I am at still with hack worth in the battalion right
[01:46:46] and he contacted his friends at the Pentagon and he said listen you guys we got a stud here
[01:46:52] and he's thinking of leaving you know show him some personal attention we got a chance to save
[01:46:59] him you know he told me this later and so I get this letter from the Pentagon you know
[01:47:04] I'm on the middle of nowhere you know and I first letter they'd ever sent me and they said
[01:47:10] they're a camp in mochuyama we have reviewed your 201 file very carefully right and we believe
[01:47:19] you have promised for graduate school okay only problem is I already had my master's
[01:47:28] which means that they didn't really pay a lot of attention right there review I showed the letter
[01:47:33] to hack and I said hey you know I mean this is crazy you know I'm gonna put my career in the hands of
[01:47:38] these guys you know and that pretty well sealed it for me and so did you did you submit your
[01:47:44] resignation while you were a stone Vietnam or to come home as soon as I came home I did I wanted to
[01:47:49] finish the tour and be at which I did and then I told the army I'm I'm gonna be out of here you know
[01:47:57] and so they assigned me to Fort Charonan Illinois right because I lived in Chicago and I finished I
[01:48:03] have three months there and then I was done and then did you at what point did you decide you're
[01:48:10] gonna stay in the reserves? Oh immediately okay that was never a question okay I was committed to
[01:48:15] doing 20 years turn out to be 32 but I you know I was committed to doing 20 because especially
[01:48:23] at that time in 70 71 the reserve components didn't have a lot of combat experience guys
[01:48:31] and I felt that it was important that I tried to help you know the reserves be ready
[01:48:39] basically and I had something to contribute so that's why I joined the reserves and then you start
[01:48:46] on your civilian career as well yeah and what happened there was I I worked for a Japanese
[01:48:54] importing and exporting company it's a color trading company and it was a name of company was
[01:49:01] Mitsui and companies world we know we used to have a saying that the sun never set on Mitsui
[01:49:07] because they had offices in like 165 countries okay and it was a very prestigious
[01:49:13] company if anybody they had quote unquote Mitsui men you know if you were a Mitsui guy that was
[01:49:20] a big deal it was like their Harvard graduates would all go there you know and things like that and
[01:49:26] I was at the Chicago office and the problem was I actually experienced reverse discrimination
[01:49:35] by that what I mean is that I had studied Japanese history, political science and Japanese language a
[01:49:42] little bit at the University of Illinois okay and I had a pretty good work ethic okay and
[01:49:52] but they couldn't it couldn't compute in their mind that I'm talking about the Japanese okay
[01:49:58] all the manager positions were Japanese like the branch manager he was a vice president you know
[01:50:05] and all that I had no opportunity to ever get to even to be a department manager in that company
[01:50:14] because they looked at me and they couldn't compute that I didn't speak Japanese fluently okay so
[01:50:22] in their mind I'm the village idiot you know even though I have my masters degree I had commanded
[01:50:29] a company in combat I had signed for $10 million worth of equipment I had more responsibility and
[01:50:35] life than these guys will ever know you know but they didn't get it they didn't understand that so
[01:50:41] I did that for about five years I mean I was treated well I have no complaints but you know
[01:50:47] I didn't expect any guarantees but I had hoped I would have an opportunity to compete
[01:50:55] and when I saw that wasn't that wasn't gonna happen I had a roommate from the U of I who was
[01:51:03] a member of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and options trading was just starting at that time
[01:51:10] and he he was a great visionary little weak on details and so he had an operation on the floor of
[01:51:21] the exchange and he realized he needed to get a handle on that and I'm pretty good with details so
[01:51:28] he called me and he said Jim I know you're not happy you know where you're at which you want to
[01:51:33] come work with me and and I said hey wait a second you know I don't have one day of finance formal
[01:51:40] education I didn't know the difference between a stock and a bond you know must
[01:51:45] for less a stock option and he said don't worry about it I know your abilities you're good with math
[01:51:51] you know this is not rocket science is stuff and I said okay I'll do it and that started out
[01:51:57] of 35 year career in financial services industry and I became a member of the New York Stock Exchange
[01:52:04] the Chicago Board Options Exchange I was very blessed I became part-owner of the company so that
[01:52:10] enabled me to devote all the time I did in the reserves that I did because I was part of the deal
[01:52:17] I made with my friend I said listen if you want me to join you I'm bringing the reserves with me
[01:52:24] and you have to understand you know if I'm called I'm going and if I'm in the reserves I'm going to
[01:52:31] give it a hundred percent you know and but he was he had gone through our T.C. with me okay so he was
[01:52:37] he was an army officer so he understood so I was able to have a successful career at the same time
[01:52:44] and you moved up really quickly through the ranks and the reserves yeah I had I had like like I said
[01:52:52] before Jack I had great N.C.O.s who made me look good I had commanders who mentored me I was I was a
[01:53:00] Brigadier General at the age of 42 and I was a major General three years later I was the youngest
[01:53:07] General in the army at the time so yeah I was I was challenged I had great assignments and so
[01:53:17] I was very blessed and my wife supported me through all of this without her I would not have
[01:53:23] been able to get the first base I noticed you you mentioned a couple times a general William Levine
[01:53:29] yes and and so the impact that he had on you he was a guy that landed a D.D. Utah beach and
[01:53:36] was one of the people that liberated Doc Ow and in World War II yes was there any
[01:53:42] significant lesson learned that he passed on to you there absolutely he he I think he's
[01:53:49] personally responsible for that balance part of my leadership concept that I've developed over my career
[01:53:57] uh he really emphasized family and and keep in mind when I joined the reserves I didn't have a
[01:54:04] clue about the citizen soldier you know those of us on air to duty what do we know about the
[01:54:09] garden reserves and their pressure you know what they do with you know people in the garden
[01:54:14] reserves have to balance three balls at the same time right you you've got your your family you've
[01:54:21] got your civilian career that puts bread and butter on the table and then you've got the reserve
[01:54:26] so the guard you know what you know and so you're balancing all that stuff and general Levine
[01:54:33] always remember emphasized the family he always made sure that we were aware of
[01:54:43] the stresses on the family you know when we were gone I'll never forget a microrear
[01:54:49] without fail that's when the furnace would break down that's when we'd have a blizzard so my
[01:54:54] 95 pound wife would have to go out there and shovel the snow because I wasn't there you know our
[01:55:01] son Jay who's who you know he he basically was a rascal when he was a young guy and my
[01:55:08] might have to take him to the emergency room in the hospital like three times I don't even know where
[01:55:13] it's time's a week and I don't even know where it's at you know because I wasn't home so you know
[01:55:20] the stresses and stuff so he really drove that home and I understood better the stresses on the
[01:55:28] citizen soldier which are tremendous you know at least when you're on active duty you're focused
[01:55:33] you know and you're in a community where everybody is going through the same thing so they all
[01:55:39] understand you know the stresses on the marriage they you know they sure things they can help each other
[01:55:45] out but then to be serves in guard you know the rest of the you go to a meeting one week in a month
[01:55:53] you know and unless you're in leadership you know that's about it and you know you don't have the
[01:56:00] you don't have the bonding and the community strength that you do when you're on active duty
[01:56:06] yeah when we got to Ramadi it was the 228 National Guard Unit out of Pennsylvania and reserve units
[01:56:12] that were all in the ground and they'd been there for I think they'd been there for 14 months
[01:56:16] but boy they were outstanding soldiers all of them it was a real honor to work with them a little
[01:56:22] bit and then get the turnover and great guys they you ran you ended up running training for like
[01:56:30] 21 out of your 25 years in the reserves that's that's that's a lot of training to run
[01:56:37] yeah I was and once again I'd say you've heard me say this before it's a god thing
[01:56:44] basically the army was the only service that really had a great
[01:56:53] process where we had reserve units whose wartime mission was to take over the training centers
[01:57:02] you know like the great lakes naval training center you know but the Navy didn't have that the
[01:57:08] Air Force didn't have that the Marines didn't have that we had reserve units that their wartime
[01:57:13] mission was to go to Fort Benning for example that was my division mission was to go to Fort Benning
[01:57:19] and take over the training of the infantry officers and recruit not officers to recruit
[01:57:25] at Fort Benning so that the active duty soldiers that were already there who were up to speed on everything
[01:57:33] you know could go join fighting units basically so that was that was the mission all right so
[01:57:40] I joined when I came off of active duty I joined the 85th training division in Chicago
[01:57:46] and that was an infantry training division at the time and I was with them for 18 years
[01:57:52] and I commanded at the company level battalion level brigade level and I was the assistant division
[01:58:00] commander and every year we would go on annual training to a active duty training
[01:58:09] for it and we take over the training of the recruits so I did it at Dix I did it at Fort Bliss
[01:58:15] I did it at Fort Ord and then finally with the 70th I did it at Fort Benning and so
[01:58:25] then what happened was I I was the commander of the 70th division out of L'Avonium Michigan
[01:58:34] and desert storm came okay and I knew we were going to be mobilized
[01:58:40] and the handwriting was on the wall okay so I put together a list I had 16 subordinate units
[01:58:49] in my I had three brigades in the training command and other things and so I made a list
[01:58:57] of one-to-16 and I prioritized them okay and it was a mixture of readiness and leadership
[01:59:08] you know that's how I prioritized them and I also had to be sensitive to
[01:59:13] I had units in Indiana and Michigan so I couldn't take all the Michigan units and leave out Indiana guys
[01:59:21] that wouldn't have been fair because everybody wanted to be mobilized
[01:59:25] okay you have to understand this was this is when this would be the first time
[01:59:31] okay and we've been practicing for like 25 years
[01:59:35] you know you're ready for game day yeah so the question is if the balloon went up would people show
[01:59:41] out you know and so so I had this list and I went to trade-ock which was our
[01:59:47] higher headquarters at Fort Benning Robe Virginia and I said listen here's my list here's my division
[01:59:54] okay I said use this list and if you're going to mobilize my division or any part of my division
[02:00:02] do it in this order and don't screw with this this is the best way this is the best way my division
[02:00:11] will serve you know the army did they comply oh yeah they were delighted it was awesome
[02:00:19] I was the only division commander that had done that so they went out to the other 11 division
[02:00:24] commanders and they hey say we need some lists you know and they did exactly what I told them
[02:00:30] they do because they mobilized half of my division so they just went right down the list you know
[02:00:35] down to eight or nine and that was it you know now you ended up having kind of a run in at the
[02:00:41] end of your career yeah I had several you know it was because of half worth you know about face
[02:00:50] and and and the first one was I went on the Oprah Winfrey show and basically my mom was still
[02:01:03] alive at that time she used to watch Oprah during the day and Oprah was out of Chicago right
[02:01:09] and and then she and she used to and I didn't know this because I never watched it but she used to
[02:01:14] announce a head of time subjects that she was going to cover and if anybody knew anyone who
[02:01:21] were experts in that area let her know you know so she could get them so she decided this is
[02:01:27] in the late eighties okay now put yourself back at that time when the economy was not doing so hot
[02:01:34] and the Japanese economy was doing real good you know because of their computers their automobiles
[02:01:40] their televisions and so people were blaming the Japanese about our poor economic situation
[02:01:49] and it was called Japan bashing and so in fact there was a Chinese guy's name was Victor Chen
[02:01:57] who was killed and Detroit by some automobile workers with baseball bats because they thought he
[02:02:05] was Japanese he was actually Chinese okay so open decided they have a show about Japan bashing
[02:02:13] so she said if anybody knows anyone you know the Japanese American community what might be a good
[02:02:19] you know person on this please let me know well my mom saw that and she said you need to get on
[02:02:25] the show you know so I tried calling I couldn't get you know how this is you know I couldn't get
[02:02:31] through whatever well I have a very I had at that time a very influential journalist in Chicago
[02:02:38] his name was Irv Cupsinet who had a very famous if's called Cups column he used to interview
[02:02:46] presidents kings and queens political people you know at in Chicago at a restaurant and so
[02:02:55] so I called Cups and I said hey Cups you know I'm trying to get through and this thing was Oprah
[02:03:01] and and he said I'll see what I can do okay two hours later I get a call from the executive
[02:03:08] producer the show and and he says I understand that you're a general in the army I said yeah I'm
[02:03:15] in the army of deserves and and that you're the highest ranking Asian American in our armed forces
[02:03:21] today and I said yeah that's right and he said well and and I I was trying to figure out where
[02:03:27] the guy was going right well he was trying to see if I could chew gum and walk at the same time
[02:03:32] so once he figured I could do that he said you know we'd like to have you on the show okay
[02:03:37] so I said fine when is it tomorrow okay so I said okay I'm in so I called my at that time I was
[02:03:45] working for a New York Stock Exchange firm and I called the headquarters in New York I said hey I needed
[02:03:51] a day off so they gave it to me and then I called the chief of army reserves office because
[02:03:57] keep in mind I'm a two-star general right and I said hey I'm going on the Oprah show you know
[02:04:04] and what's the subject well the subject is Japan bashing but I'm being invited because you know I'm
[02:04:11] high ranking Japanese American in our army and I'm gonna wear my uniform you know so
[02:04:17] I get a call back okay from the chief of public affairs of the army now he's a one-star
[02:04:25] okay and I'm a two-star okay so he calls and he said I understand you're gonna be on the
[02:04:31] open show yeah it's right what's the subject Japan bashing oh it's not about the army no it's
[02:04:38] not about the military at all but I'm being invited because I'm the highest ranking Japanese
[02:04:43] American in the army in the military you'll hold military and being in O8 at the time and he said well
[02:04:52] then we don't want you to wear your uniform okay and I said listen I take my responsibility very
[02:05:00] seriously as a role model from minorities this is a great opportunity to let people know
[02:05:09] that we have equal opportunity in our armed forces I don't see this as a as a possibility to fail I see
[02:05:19] this is an opportunity to succeed and I and I just said I you know I don't really have a lot of
[02:05:25] time for this because it was going to be the next day right so I said is this in order you know
[02:05:31] from you know the secretary or from the chief I don't care you know whoever's above me is this in order
[02:05:39] and he said well I can't tell you it's in order and I said well okay in that case thank you very
[02:05:45] much for calling me you know I appreciate what you said I've taken it all in under consideration
[02:05:52] bottom line I'm wearing my uniform and that was the end of it okay so he writes a memorandum for
[02:05:58] record that to the chief of staff at the army that went into my file that said you know I spoke to
[02:06:05] John Wilmingham I told him it was you know above his paid rate levels and he might get involved with
[02:06:12] you know things that went out of hand and all that and he basically told me that he was going
[02:06:17] to wear his uniform so so I go on the show okay and I'm ready I do my homework okay and
[02:06:25] we come out from commercial break and Oprah starts out by saying and today we have with us major
[02:06:31] general Jim Mukwoyama the highest ranking Asian American Japanese American in our military today
[02:06:40] camera and I'm going to sit there in the civilian suit I mean what kind of a message with that
[02:06:45] it was I was in my class eight of course okay so and the first words out of my mouth were
[02:06:52] Oprah I want everyone to understand that whatever I say today is the opinion of Jim Mukwoyama
[02:07:00] I am not representing the department of the army I'm not representing the department of the
[02:07:06] defense however I am a soldier in the United States Army I'm proud of it we have equal opportunity
[02:07:13] in our armed forces end of message and the rest of the thing went very well and they actually had
[02:07:21] a guy on there who I would affectionately refer to as a redneck and he was blaming the Japanese for
[02:07:27] all the problems and some of it was correct where they weren't fair in some of the economic
[02:07:34] dealings with us you know there were there markets were not as open to our products as they
[02:07:41] should have been but on the other hand it got was saying some nutty stuff like he said well they're
[02:07:46] costing us jobs okay so I said okay who's the fourth largest law automobile manufacturer in the country
[02:07:55] the answer Honda America okay they have a plant in Mary'sville Ohio that employed 3500
[02:08:04] Americans okay they can't close that plan and take it back to Japan it's in the United States
[02:08:12] and I said I'm also tired of hearing people complaining about American quality because the Honda
[02:08:18] Syviks produced a debt plant have fewer defects than Honda Syviks that were coming from Japan
[02:08:24] well JD powers I had I had all this already don't mess with the general so then I told them I said
[02:08:33] and guess what the steel for that plant comes from a Indiana which is also jobs for Americans okay
[02:08:44] then the other thing the guy said was the the the Asians are taking over our universities
[02:08:51] I said what's that all about and he said well they're getting all the scholarships okay and I said listen
[02:08:57] the Asian Americans are not smarter than any other ethnicity or race the reason they do so
[02:09:07] well in school is the parents get involved and they make sure that their kids study and they
[02:09:14] emphasize the value of education that kind of huge approval from the audience you know so what happened was
[02:09:23] there was a believe it or not a federal judge in Chicago who saw that program okay so he writes a letter
[02:09:33] to the secretary of defense saying you know let's I saw the Oprah show and there was this
[02:09:38] major general Jim Moquillama who really did a great job for you guys and you guys should be proud of him right
[02:09:45] so the secretary defense at that time was Dick Cheney okay so he endorses the letter down to the
[02:09:53] secretary of the army the secretary of the army endorses the letter down to the chief of staff at the
[02:09:58] army so when that hits my file same time the other thing hit my file basically one cancel the other
[02:10:06] did you send a photo copy of that back to me yeah that's not me yeah but that's you know so right
[02:10:13] then and there the army knew what they were dealing with because I you know I was you know it was
[02:10:19] an opportunity to show that we have equal opportunity and he armed forces I tell people that
[02:10:27] one of the proudest things of my service was that when I was loose track of people's race
[02:10:34] you know I stopped looking at people as as Asian American or African American and in
[02:10:39] or Hispanic Americans I looked at them as private or full lieutenant whatever their job was
[02:10:47] in the military that's how I caught myself forgetting sometimes of people you know because I tell
[02:10:52] people everybody was all of drab. Yeah yeah so that was my first the first. Now you started to say
[02:11:01] that the book the book did the book start to play any kind of role in your career did people start
[02:11:06] talking about hackworth's book. No not really that that read I when I mean by that is you know the
[02:11:15] whole stance that he took about Vietnam to risk his career and just actually just saying hey I'm
[02:11:21] out of here because you know I've done this now for 30 something years and frankly it was weighing
[02:11:28] on him let me talk about the moral injury of knowing that you're leading soldiers in combat when
[02:11:34] they could have been the policy could have been done better which would have resulted in fewer
[02:11:41] casualties. Yeah that's I don't know if there's a heavier weight to bear than that that's a
[02:11:47] heavy one and then what was the next thing you took a stance on? Well the next thing that happened
[02:11:53] which caused the end of my career basically is I like that you say that with a smile on your face.
[02:11:59] Well I'm I don't regret a day. If I had to do it again today I do it in a heartbeat and here's
[02:12:07] what happened was I was an army reserve guy so for full transparency to your listeners okay I was
[02:12:15] on active duty for five years I was on an army reserveist for 27 years okay now the army has
[02:12:22] three components they have the active component they have the army reserve and they have the army
[02:12:31] national guard okay the army reserve and army national guard are the so-called reserve components okay
[02:12:40] now the active army of course are the 24-7 that's their full-time job the army reserves are a federal
[02:12:50] force and the army reserves fall into the normal army chain of command the partner of the army
[02:12:58] we answer to the orders of the president okay army national guard does not fall into that
[02:13:07] chain of command nor do they be poured to the president they be poured to the governors of each state
[02:13:14] it's really a state organization although 95% of their budget comes from the federal government okay
[02:13:26] and as an army reserveist for 25 years 27 years I saw whenever it came to
[02:13:35] a reducing the army force structure the army reserves would always get the short end and the
[02:13:45] guard would always be protected okay the actors would always take care of themselves that was never
[02:13:50] an issue okay but the so-called one army concept where everybody's supposed to be together in this
[02:13:58] the reserves always got the short end of the stick and the reason for that is the reserves were
[02:14:04] a national force okay we were professional in you know in the military as as you know
[02:14:14] you're not supposed to be political you're supposed to be a political right not involved in
[02:14:20] lobbying and stuff like that the national guard is very political it's jobs for the state
[02:14:28] okay so whenever there's the national guard has so much political cloud if you look at any
[02:14:38] presidential election just watch the week before the election in November that's when the guard normally
[02:14:45] has their national convention in DC okay and I can tell you every major presidential candidate
[02:14:56] shows up okay and and keep in mind they have the political support of a governor two senators
[02:15:05] and the congressman right the army reserve doesn't have that political cloud so frankly we've
[02:15:12] always gotten gotten screwed and so I I watched that for 25 years I said enough is enough
[02:15:19] and so I I found that a 501c3 organization called the army reserve association which was comprised
[02:15:27] of officers enlisted and civilians the mission was to educate the public and congress
[02:15:36] about the army reserves because people when they think of they hear of the reserves they think of the
[02:15:41] national guard they don't think of the army reserves which has armories and they have soldiers
[02:15:47] and every state and our union but people don't think about that okay so when desert storm ended
[02:15:56] right when desert storm hit the army mobilized both national guard and reserve units okay
[02:16:07] the national guard had no full transparency as I said I'm an army reserve guy okay so I'm
[02:16:13] pretty jaded on this you want to say that but you know the national guard has great patriots
[02:16:22] I'm not casting aspersions on them at all you know but effects are facts and here's what
[02:16:29] happened when when does the storm hit the national guard heads three so-called premier infantry
[02:16:37] brigades that were supposed to round out active duty divisions okay one of them was the 48th
[02:16:46] of Georgia okay and there is a national guard brigade that in upon mobilization they would be assigned
[02:16:55] to that division and they would go to war with the division okay and what happened was when it came
[02:17:03] and by the way they had all the best equipment they had better equipment than some active army
[02:17:10] battalions in brigades they had Abrams tanks they have to understand this is early 90s they had
[02:17:16] Abrams tanks and they had Bradley vehicles when a lot of active units didn't have that okay but
[02:17:24] they were publicized as being the premier army national guard combat units that were ready to go to war okay
[02:17:34] when the balloon went up the army said we can't send these guys they're just going to be cannon fodder
[02:17:41] so they sent them to the NTC and national training center in California for 90 days okay
[02:17:47] only problem was the war ended so quick they never got to the they never got there okay the reserves on
[02:17:54] the other hand our soldiers performed magnificently we had helicopter units we had medical units
[02:18:01] we had civil affairs we had syups we you know our our people did extremely my training division
[02:18:09] perfect example you know we were mobilized I had my guys in the front gates of forward bending
[02:18:14] within 72 hours in my drill instructors around the trail my my my my instructors around the
[02:18:25] platform teaching you know running the ranges and all that and so then when it came time to
[02:18:31] downsize is that where you took a stand yeah absolutely what happened was that you know when the
[02:18:39] we so we winded that there's a storm and then the Soviet Union falls apart and the wall comes down
[02:18:46] right so everybody's looking for this piece of the night to transfer money from the defense department
[02:18:52] to social services okay and so the army has a process that's called the total army analysis
[02:19:02] it's a very good logical process so you can determine the force structure that we need for the army
[02:19:11] okay and the way it works is you look at what are the what are we facing throughout the world
[02:19:20] you know whether the problem areas you know and then you say yourself okay based on that
[02:19:26] how many divisions do you have infantry divisions do we need how many armor you know some
[02:19:32] many helicopter pretend you know blah blah blah and then you face reality and you say how much
[02:19:39] money can we really get out of Congress for this so based on all that stuff you come up with a
[02:19:45] force structure okay the army didn't do that what they did is they had the vice chief of staff
[02:19:55] of the army the chief of army reserves the chief of the National Guard Bureau the president
[02:20:02] of the National Guard Association which is not a government and the president of the reserve officers
[02:20:10] association go to a hotel and they cut a deal and it was called the off site agreement because
[02:20:19] it wasn't done at the Pentagon okay well I told you I had formed a army reserve association
[02:20:27] I had people in that meeting within five minutes I knew what happened and the army reserves
[02:20:34] really they they eliminated 80% of army reserve aviation and we had four special forces groups at
[02:20:44] that time and the reserve components there were two national guard groups the 19th and 20th
[02:20:50] and two army reserve special forces groups the 11th and the 12th the 12th of the
[02:20:56] zone was one of the units died was under my command and I was the deputy commanding general
[02:21:02] of an army reserve unit so I'll give you an example we had a black hawk battalion once again
[02:21:10] in my army reserve under my command that fought in the Gulf they were so good that Schwartz
[02:21:17] cough selected them for his taxing unit okay and they had received the it's called the army
[02:21:26] aviation association award triple a award for the best black hawk battalion so that's how
[02:21:34] good these guys were okay this agreement eliminated that unit out of the army reserves
[02:21:41] and put it into the Illinois National Guard okay now I'm a big boy I can I can accept
[02:21:50] I don't appreciate it as a taxpayer but I can accept waste of money or whatever
[02:21:56] where I draw the line in the sand is when you jeopardize soldiers' lives and the readiness
[02:22:02] of our forces okay this unit overnight oh what I didn't tell you was the Illinois National Guard
[02:22:11] did not have one qualified black hawk pilot or mechanic they could not even fly those birds
[02:22:19] from Scott Air Force Base where we had them to the Illinois National Guard
[02:22:24] field they had to go to the Wisconsin and Minnesota Guard to borrow pilots so they could move
[02:22:33] those birds now the implication is that unit overnight went from C1 you know the highest readiness
[02:22:41] rating down to C5 which is non-negotiable basically you know and it took about to be a year's
[02:22:52] plus to get that unit up to C3 which is just marginal deployment level okay so that's one example
[02:23:01] another example are those special forces groups okay there I mean look at the four reserve
[02:23:06] components special forces groups and they said you know we only need two okay so we'll eliminate
[02:23:13] the National Guard you know groups because you know why does the National Guard govern why does
[02:23:19] a governor need a farcee speaking demolition zexford okay and the last time I looked we didn't
[02:23:25] have an insurgency in Illinois so so the National Guard says no we don't accept that so the army
[02:23:32] with their tail between their legs go back to the drawing board and they looked at readiness which is
[02:23:38] what they probably should have done to begin with and they found out that the 12th group in the USA
[02:23:43] in the army reserves was the best out of the four and then it was either I think it was the 20th
[02:23:49] out of the guard was the second best so they said okay we got the solution we'll take one out of each
[02:23:56] component right guard wouldn't accept that so what did they do they eliminated both our
[02:24:04] may reserve you know groups and I was live it because the 12th was under me at one time I wasn't
[02:24:12] the commander but it was in my chain we had taken that unit from C4 to C2 which for reserve unit to
[02:24:22] be able to get reserveist to past those special forces qualifications that's not easy okay
[02:24:32] and they eliminated that unit now I'm a big boy okay when it came like to the the
[02:24:40] helicopter units and I said okay take my pilots and so and mechanics take the reserve patch off
[02:24:50] their shoulder make a national guardsman I'm good with it okay it wouldn't do it because it was
[02:24:58] jobs for the guard so my guys had to find new jobs some of them had to actually change them
[02:25:06] oasis because you know there were no no aviation jobs from them right and just think you and I
[02:25:14] it's taxpayers how much that cost us you know so now I'm getting all kinds of calls from the field
[02:25:22] you know we didn't have computers at that time in the internet so I'd get telephone calls and
[02:25:27] faxes saying journal somebody's got to stand up and fight this you know and that meeting I told
[02:25:34] you about that they had I found out from my moles that in us and they were going to have a press conference
[02:25:41] the next day where everybody was going to hold hands and sing kumbaya and say that the army has
[02:25:50] come up with this great agreement where everybody agrees and nobody disagrees well that was
[02:25:57] true a lot of people disagreed with it so I called the vice chief of staff's office at the Pentagon
[02:26:05] right not as major general jim huyama but as jim huyama president army reserve association
[02:26:14] okay so I called asking for a return call about this press conference it's going to happen or announcement
[02:26:23] you know and I didn't get a call back so the next morning and hour before their press conference
[02:26:32] we sent out a press release and we basically said this is not good this is you know shouldn't go
[02:26:40] through need to have a GAO study a government accounting office study and that pretty well got me
[02:26:49] into the crossers and so then what we did is and now keep in mind I had never done this in my life
[02:26:56] I had never lobbied I had never been to congress I had never walked the halls you know any of that stuff
[02:27:02] we had a we actually and I think I might have sent you something stuff but we had a
[02:27:09] meeting of the army reserve association called for it in Washington DC and I had men and women come
[02:27:16] from all over the country and we went and we lobbied our senators and congressmen and we told them
[02:27:25] this is wrong this needs to be a GAO study needs to be studied before it's implemented okay
[02:27:33] now frankly I knew we were tilting at windmills but I had to do it because you know all I was
[02:27:39] getting all these requests from sergeants and civilians and latinants and majors throughout the
[02:27:47] country saying somebody's got to fight this and they were right so I had to do it some then
[02:27:54] I get an invitation from a congressional subcommittee okay it was not a subpoena so I didn't
[02:28:01] have to go I could have said I've got a headache or I've got a conflict or whatever but I didn't
[02:28:07] you know I said yeah I'll be there and I went and I testified and a year later I was history
[02:28:15] shall we say but it's like I said Jock I wouldn't hesitate in a moment to do it again
[02:28:25] it's when I was in Vietnam I knew that our generals were not standing up for us all the time
[02:28:30] like they should and I said ever get to a point in my for it's a difference between my career and
[02:28:38] and my soldiers the soldiers win yeah absolutely and that's one of those balanced things too is
[02:28:46] you know as leader what you know you you want to tell the line and I have people ask me this
[02:28:50] pretty regularly well you know you always say you want to support the chain of command but
[02:28:54] what if the chain of command is wrong no it's real simple answer if the chain of command is wrong
[02:28:57] and it's something that matters like the safety of your troops the training of your troops then
[02:29:03] you you stand up to it you know if it's something that doesn't matter if they go we want you to
[02:29:07] fill out this paper work differently than you did it yesterday you know what I do I do it right I don't
[02:29:11] care you know you want me to put my uniform on this way instead of that way that's fine whatever I'll
[02:29:16] do it you want to start putting soldiers at jeopardy that won't that won't stand so here's what
[02:29:22] happened okay while all this stuff is going on the Washington Post puts this front page okay
[02:29:29] and it talks about how the the the the this big controversy you know in my associations right
[02:29:36] at the forefront of all the so I'm quoted and all it's now keep in mind I'm still an active
[02:29:41] arm and these are major general and radar right and and in fact before I testified I got a call
[02:29:50] from the chief of staff at trade-ock was a good friend of mine we were both major generals
[02:29:55] and and he didn't tell me I shouldn't go he kind of said that well you know it's really not a good
[02:30:03] idea you know for you to go and he was a good friend of mine and I said John you know I understand
[02:30:10] this is you have to do this this is your you know this is your job but I got to go I can't
[02:30:16] I cannot stand by and let this pass so he under well and so that was also in the Washington Post
[02:30:25] you know like I was threatened I wasn't threatened you know and so so basically I
[02:30:34] then the army times wrote a net tutorial which basically criticized the army reserves especially
[02:30:42] my association you know and saying the army reserves are not team players their cry babies you know
[02:30:51] and but what got me is when they said they're putting out bad information okay that was in
[02:30:56] their editorial okay so I wrote an op-f which to their credit they published okay and in the op-fed
[02:31:06] I said number one where is and the title of their their editorial was the enemy is us okay
[02:31:16] and I said I agree with you the enemy is us but the problem is number one where is
[02:31:25] you didn't list in detail the false information that was being put out by the reserves
[02:31:33] so you need to do that I said that in the op-fed they never did by the way because we had never
[02:31:39] put out anything false but the second thing I said and I said if we go to war in the next 18 months
[02:31:49] and this thing goes through we're gonna have people coming back and body bags that would not have
[02:31:54] I mean now that's a pretty serious statement okay and you would think if I was chicken little saying
[02:32:03] the sky was falling that they would have been inundated with letters from the field saying you know
[02:32:10] the general is gone too far right they didn't get one letter and so but so because of the stand I
[02:32:19] took needless to say the army wasn't real happy with me and a year later when it came time to
[02:32:28] to get a new assignment surprise surprise I was not considered there were no assignments
[02:32:35] that I was considered eligible for and so I I said this has been fun so the chief of our
[02:32:43] reserve actually wanted me to stay and he said this two shall pass so why don't you stay you can
[02:32:49] go into control group which is kind of this administrative pool of people who don't have assignments
[02:32:55] and maybe in a year or two you can come back you know we'll get you an assignment and I said no
[02:33:01] I said you know the army's made it very clear you know they they don't want my services they don't
[02:33:07] think I have any value and I'm gonna move on I'm gonna move on in life hmm hmm so
[02:33:12] what I did now even though you moved on you retired you didn't stop serving by any stretch and
[02:33:19] and you know I look at the military outreach that you started is really your new way of serving
[02:33:25] it was that is that an accurate statement oh absolutely what what happened was you know my wife is
[02:33:31] is so wonderful she she says she's not as as a Christian as I am but she lives her life
[02:33:38] better than I do and so I'm having my personal pity party feeling sorry for myself because my 32 year
[02:33:45] career is down to toilet right and she said Jim you know God is sending you a message number one
[02:33:53] that you know this chapter in your life is over okay number two you survive Vietnam you also
[02:34:02] became a Tain the rank of two star general which was the highest in reserveist could get at that time okay
[02:34:09] and then she says number three and you got me as a wife how can I argue with that right
[02:34:16] but she was absolutely right what happened was God brought other things into my life at that time
[02:34:23] promised keepers which is a men's Christian group I got involved with a church in Chicago
[02:34:31] a real quick community church which is a very famous evangelical church I I let a men's small group
[02:34:38] I lead a men's monthly breakfast I got involved with the department of veterans affairs which I had
[02:34:45] never been involved in before at a national level I was a chairman of an advisory committee on
[02:34:51] minority veterans and I was I was on that for five years so I learned about the VA system
[02:34:59] all of this was in preparation for me to eventually start military outreach USA about seven years ago
[02:35:09] which is a nonprofit faith based organization for the very simple concept jacco we're trying to
[02:35:17] develop a national network of partners mostly houses of worship of all faiths by the way
[02:35:25] and organizations like the BFW American Legion rotary clubs lions clubs high schools this is all at the
[02:35:36] local community level that will reach out to our military community which we define by the way
[02:35:44] as active duty reserves national guard veterans of all areas and their family members we stress the
[02:35:51] family members equally because they serve in sacrifices well okay and to reach out to them to be
[02:36:00] a welcoming environment to appreciate their service recognize that and to offer hope and help
[02:36:07] if they need it now the churches and and synagogues want to help they don't know how to do it
[02:36:14] because they don't understand the military culture they don't know the issues that our military
[02:36:22] community is facing and they don't know where the resources are that's where military outreach USA
[02:36:29] comes in we provide all of that information we have webinars we have publications we have DVDs
[02:36:38] we have presentations and everything that we do is free of charge no cost the only thing we ask is
[02:36:49] when people join us as partners either as a house of worship or as an organization that they
[02:36:55] commit to take our materials and use them to help our military community and it doesn't cost them anything
[02:37:02] and if people want to want to help out military outreach USA the website is military outreach
[02:37:11] USA dot org that's correct and then from there what are you looking for? Well we have numerous
[02:37:18] programs because we understand houses of worship coming all shapes and sizes okay so we have
[02:37:26] different programs that they can choose from some are as simple as a church can list the names
[02:37:35] of service members who are currently serving you know either relatives or members of the church
[02:37:42] and people can pray for them prayer is so important when you're overseas especially in a combat
[02:37:49] situation I know it helped me a lot when I was in combat I needed all I could get I'll tell you
[02:37:57] but also they could do things like send packages send letters how today who writes letters nobody
[02:38:04] you know it's all email and all that stuff how about getting a letter right at mail call how need is that
[02:38:11] you know but then we can also do things for veterans in fact we we have
[02:38:18] two years ago we started a program and by the way we have a memorandum of agreement that was
[02:38:25] signed by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016 by the secretary himself which recognized military
[02:38:34] outreach USA as a national partner with them on a program that we initiated called Veterans
[02:38:42] Exiting Homelessness okay now here's the thing the VA has done a very good job in reducing
[02:38:52] the veteran homeless population it's still too high but three years ago it was like 150,000
[02:38:59] you know it's like 50,000 now which is still too high but look at the look at the reduction okay
[02:39:04] well that's created a new problem and the problem is when they take a homeless veteran mail or female
[02:39:11] some with kids off the street and they work with a case worker or a social worker okay and the
[02:39:19] social worker feels that they're stabilized and now they can get them into what's so it's called
[02:39:24] permanent housing which is really an apartment that's got it's subsidized by a HUD-Vash
[02:39:31] voucher okay they give them the keys they be apartment right but homeless people that's all they
[02:39:38] give them so just think at the first time you moved into an apartment you need stuff
[02:39:44] like all toilet paper buckets sponges, mobs you know dishes how about a bed homeless people they
[02:39:54] get a one bedroom apartment but guess what they don't have a death right so we came up with this
[02:39:59] program called move any essentials and we listed things like we have a bathroom kit we have a kitchen
[02:40:07] kit we even have a beds for vets program okay and what we've done is we've gone out to our
[02:40:15] our churches our partners you know our organizations and we've asked them can you conduct a donation
[02:40:21] drive of this stuff okay and not asking them collect money give me the stuff okay and then
[02:40:29] it's delivered to the VA medical center social worker and they distributed to the veterans so
[02:40:38] we know they're going to veterans okay because you know there are a lot of people out there
[02:40:43] are clean to be veterans who are not and so we know they're going to veterans and it goes out
[02:40:49] almost as quick as it comes in okay this has helped us a great deal as an organization because before
[02:40:56] we're at a point in time where we really can move up to the next level is an organization
[02:41:04] but we frankly need volunteers and money okay because we don't have a staff we've done all this
[02:41:10] on a shoe string basically and so with this program we now have results that we can show people okay
[02:41:20] so people come to me and say you know what difference are you guys making two years ago all I could
[02:41:27] say was what were developing this network of partners and we're asking them to help you know
[02:41:34] in their communities which did make a difference by the way I mean we prevented some suicides
[02:41:39] we've helped people that needed stuff you know but we did the have I don't I don't have the staff
[02:41:46] to record all of this stuff you know but when we came up with this program we have a tracking
[02:41:53] thing where we know how many veterans are being helped we know what's been collected and we know
[02:42:00] so now if somebody says what difference do you make okay since January of 2016
[02:42:07] we have helped over 31,000 veterans we've collected over 750,000 items in fact I think it's over
[02:42:20] million though and valued at almost 2 million dollars and we have we just provided this month
[02:42:30] our 1000's bed okay and so now I got stuff that I can tell people this well we come up with
[02:42:39] the new program this year and it's called adopt a caregiver okay see what we're trying to do is find
[02:42:48] find gaps where there's a need and nobody else is filling it so we first we did that veteran
[02:42:56] exiting homelessness thing well now there are 5.5 million military caregivers in our country
[02:43:06] okay serving over 1.1 million normal military okay and they get some help from the VA
[02:43:19] but not a lot as much as they need okay so we are now going to our churches and our
[02:43:26] organizations and we're saying we have this program adopt a caregiver okay and if you want to be a
[02:43:34] caregiver you let us know and we'll contact the local social worker and volunteer
[02:43:42] support at the VA facility near you and we'll hook you up with a caregiver that needs help
[02:43:51] now this could be anything could be babysitting could be mowing along it could be shoveling snow
[02:43:57] it could be showing up with a meal it could be just showing up and being there for 3 hours
[02:44:04] and let the caregiver get up break okay this is not rocket science it's stuff it's an easy
[02:44:10] program but it's something that if we can get this moving like we did the veteran exiting homelessness
[02:44:17] it's going to be a tremendous help for our veterans and but most importantly for the caregivers
[02:44:23] you see at another lifetime my wife and I were hospice patient volunteers we did that for six
[02:44:31] years so I know how it is to deal with terminal illness okay but I also witnessed that it's the
[02:44:41] caregivers who are sometimes need to help more than the patient you know and so in this case
[02:44:50] we've got military caregivers that need help and we can do it through this program
[02:44:57] well it sounds like like I said you're continuing to serve even though you're no longer in
[02:45:02] uniform and I think that's probably a pretty good place to wrap up for today and you know again
[02:45:11] it's been just an absolute honor to sit down and talk with you as we get feedback from this
[02:45:17] episode I will come to Chicago and go to your museum and and we'll do this again yeah let me
[02:45:25] say one thing that I was not able to get in and anybody who knows me would tell me June why
[02:45:31] didn't you say that I have a standard mantra okay and that is every day is a great day I have my
[02:45:38] faith my family and live in the finest country in the world I say it every day every chance I got
[02:45:46] and people ask me well why you know how can you be so positive and you know why do you say that I say
[02:45:52] well number one is a very young 24-year-old company commander in Vietnam in combat there were times
[02:46:00] I didn't know if I was going to be alive the next moment much less seed and next sunrise
[02:46:06] when you're in no circumstances what is important in life becomes real focused and that is faith,
[02:46:12] family and living in the finest country in the world now so then people will come back at me and say well
[02:46:18] how can you say that when we have so much division in our country okay and I say listen I'm a little bit
[02:46:25] longer and toothed than you are and when I was a kid the I've seen the improvements in our society
[02:46:32] when it comes to race relations now I'm a minority so I get it and I told them the odds of
[02:46:39] me becoming when I was a kid the odds of me becoming a major general in the United States Army
[02:46:45] were slim and next and none okay when you know when we've had an African American president who was
[02:46:53] re-elected and then I tell people when president Kennedy was elected that was a big deal and
[02:47:01] a lot of people don't know why and I say because he was Catholic but today that's that's not a
[02:47:07] big deal right in that that those in those days that was a big deal so I tell people every day
[02:47:14] is a great day I have my faith my family we live in the finest country in the world well
[02:47:19] that saying was challenged about five and a half years ago when I had some health challenges which
[02:47:26] I think I didn't mention it earlier I was still working in financial services in the street and I
[02:47:36] got up in the morning on shaving and I felt this pain in my chest and I mean it wasn't a serious
[02:47:43] pounding and I wasn't sweating nauseous I didn't have a temperature so I thought it was something I ate
[02:47:49] you know give it five minutes it'll go away right it didn't go away so I told my wife this is not good
[02:47:57] so I finished shaving and dressing though and she drove me to the emergency room of the hospital
[02:48:03] so I walk in and I say hey you know I've got this pain in my chest I don't know what it is
[02:48:08] so they do an EKG and they said you have had a heart attack well suddenly all these doctors and
[02:48:14] nurses swoop into the ER they address me they put me in a hospital gown I'm on a gurney and I'm on my
[02:48:21] way to the operating room right so I'm in the corridor and on this gurney and I say to myself
[02:48:28] self can you say today is a great day and I said I absolutely can I survive yet um
[02:48:35] I have a wonderful wife and children and I most importantly have my faith so in 24 hours I have
[02:48:49] three operations the first operation was for the heart attack okay so they do an angel grand they
[02:48:55] found out my LAD which is the widow maker artery was 90% block so they do an angel plastic put a
[02:49:03] stand in so by 10 o'clock in the morning I'm in the recovery room so I'm forgetting well that's
[02:49:08] that's the end of it right that wasn't the end of it the second thing that happened was my heart
[02:49:14] cavity started to fill up with liquid it's called a fusion so I had to go back in for and they
[02:49:21] had to put a hole in my chest so they could put a tube there so they could drain this liquid and it
[02:49:26] filled up the bottle it took about 24 hours to do that okay the third thing that happened then
[02:49:33] was my kidneys failed so I had to go back in and they had to put another hole in my chest so they
[02:49:40] could hook up a dialysis machine okay so the standard procedure every time I was rolled into the
[02:49:48] operating room is what's your name what's your birthday how do you feel okay so I'm on the operating
[02:49:55] table and I say Jim Moquillama August 3rd 44 every day is a great day I have my faith my family
[02:50:03] and live in the finest country in the world I can't tell you the effect that had on the doctors and
[02:50:09] nurses the first operation the doctor said what is your faith and I said well since you asked me
[02:50:15] doc I said I'm a Christian Christ is my Savior your skill physician skill nurses but I'm in God's hands
[02:50:24] so whatever he decides I'm okay with so let's get on with it so the second operation there was a
[02:50:31] nurse and she said where do you go to church and I said well I attend Willow Creek Community Church
[02:50:39] and she said I do too so no coincidence the third operation this was the coolest thing
[02:50:47] there was a male nurse who is wearing a camouflage gown and I said you must have been in
[02:50:53] the army because I said yeah I was a medic and I said well hey I just want you to know
[02:50:59] every tired is the two star general so take good care of me will you and so that was kind of
[02:51:05] my my testing of all that now the final thing I tell you which was a god thing
[02:51:14] months later I was going I had to go through dialysis okay so I'm going through this dialysis
[02:51:20] and three months later I get a donor and the donor was our daughter okay but our daughter is not
[02:51:28] our biological daughter we adopted her 30 something years ago and yet she was a match so
[02:51:37] guys when I say every day is a great day I have my faith my family and live in the kind of
[02:51:43] finest country in the world I can truly say that and every day every day is an encouragement to me okay
[02:51:51] today was an encouragement this morning when I was honored to participate in the National Day of
[02:51:57] Prayer with the 79th theater, sustainment command at La Salamitos and this podcast is an encouragement
[02:52:07] to me so I just want you to know that and remember every day is a great day faith family

[02:56:29] it's like yeah because a steak is a different thing for me steak is a little bit of a different
[02:56:33] experience that's a really good experience so technically you kind of got to try to play steak no
[02:56:40] but if you live the last fast I did you know and I posted that picture and I went got that
[02:56:47] I wouldn't got a killer steak yeah any I think was so good because you did after that so good yeah
[02:56:54] we got 100% of the taste 100% of the taste no more than 100% the country 10% yeah yeah
[02:57:02] somebody sent me some tomahawk steaks to my house and they came with instructions from the company
[02:57:11] that sent him on how to cook them and I don't remember the name of the company right now I fall
[02:57:15] those instructions I cook those steaks those things were epic yeah they were epic yeah so
[02:57:23] interestingly yeah no steaks came to my house or anything like that or you know the house next
[02:57:29] time but hey they do sound good and they sound even better after because currently we're getting
[02:57:33] our fast on yes currently officially too yeah what do we have you know well are you I'm at
[02:57:43] I'm at 23 hours or something or nothing I think I'm at like 18 or I know it's good you need
[02:57:49] 11 o'clock last night yeah you got issues why that's how what are you doing even 11 o'clock at night because
[02:57:55] like I don't really start eating till like later in the day you say I don't know he breakfast like
[02:58:00] that you see him playing though like let's say he eat three meals a day and that's not a lot
[02:58:04] by the way that's actually a little bit you know some guys it all it's six times a day you know that kind
[02:58:08] not like that kind three times a day sometimes too so let's say I ate my first meal no breakfast
[02:58:15] only water maybe some coffee sometimes maybe some get ready sometimes maybe like a banana sometimes
[02:58:21] not a lot nonetheless at noon ish one maybe too lunch dinner eight it like six boom and then again
[02:58:30] at 11 that's not that much yeah okay do you want to do it over there nonetheless I'm at about 18 hours
[02:58:36] you can take and that's take that you're just talking about the Tom Aquan sounds real good yeah
[02:58:41] but yeah better cut real fired up but that's right now real fired up by the way you didn't even
[02:58:46] mention where you can get all this good stuff well there's even more good stuff so what I what I
[02:58:50] like to do is like get us really excited about everything and then it's like dang working you get it
[02:58:55] boom or you know I do want to say we have in the testing phase right now chocolate peanut butter
[02:59:03] milk milk now everyone's probably wondering hey what's up what's up with just chocolate milk yeah
[02:59:12] we for whatever reason I don't know if it's the complimentary of flavors but we haven't been
[02:59:17] able to nail the chocolate flavor the way we want it at this time yeah the the mint I don't know you
[02:59:25] know the mint is awesome the chocolate peanut butter epic yeah we haven't nailed the chocolate yet
[02:59:31] we got vanilla the vanilla's I'm not a vanilla fan yeah but the vanilla's good yeah I can't I can't
[02:59:38] give it nine stars because I I can't give nine stars to things that I don't personally really love
[02:59:45] the taste of because I don't love vanilla I'll try it again once once we roll out with the actual
[02:59:51] live vanilla milk sure but the chocolate milk will come when we get it right but the peanut butter
[02:59:57] milk stand by the get so yeah it's so good isn't that the whole kind of defining factor of the
[03:00:04] vanilla flavor it's like it's not supposed to be amazing it's supposed to be vanilla like people
[03:00:08] use the word vanilla no no no no no no no no no no no no let me tell you I actually let me tell you
[03:00:14] when when I do absolutely love vanilla flavor you know when you go to a restaurant and you're
[03:00:22] like all right tonight we're gonna get some and you order dessert and you get some kind of a chocolate
[03:00:28] scenario let's say let's just let's just talk about a chocolate that's not chocolate brownie right
[03:00:35] sir yeah you roll up one of those so there's my my local one of my local restaurants they have a
[03:00:42] dessert they call it the illegal because it's so good it should be illegal yeah this is raglan
[03:00:50] sure raglan will be and what it is they take a cast iron skillet and they put
[03:00:57] chocolate chip cookie in there and then and I when they make it for us we don't we get it
[03:01:03] I don't want every two months we'll go illegal time and that was an extra ice cream because you
[03:01:10] need it because it's got that chocolate it's hot yeah so good and you know what I just realized
[03:01:15] we're on the 24 hour fast right now all the time I was through yeah it's like dang this
[03:01:21] thing kind of long but I kind of don't mind it and you're right about that vanilla thing too
[03:01:25] by the way because people do well people do use the word vanilla to describe a real
[03:01:30] bit of the brand stuff just yes just vanilla which is you know it's not great but it's not
[03:01:34] junk it's still it's still a bit of a cast iron skillet you're 100% right especially when
[03:01:40] you said when you go to restaurants I probably go on where you go with this and you absolutely
[03:01:43] right so that being said so what do you do then you put some chocolate like her she's
[03:01:48] syrup in the vanilla milk that's a violation though but that'd be a big fight that just sounds
[03:01:52] real good right now I'm just that's why that's so sick nonetheless the
[03:01:57] she never let me go it should be illegal for us to do see I've been I've been fasting before
[03:02:02] and done the podcast but this is different when I know that you're yeah yeah yeah yeah
[03:02:05] the same boat and this is kind of like a usually I'm just cruising at home like I didn't
[03:02:09] done it before for sure but it was crazy at home and it's like boom but now like yeah once you
[03:02:14] get the talking about it shoot then I and I got a dry boat Wendy's on the way all the way so
[03:02:19] something check either way you get all this stuff vanilla milk not right now uh chocolate
[03:02:27] peanut butter milk not right now chocolate mint yes mint chocolate right now right now
[03:02:34] and we're all gonna origin main dot com this where you get it boom and all the other the
[03:02:39] jockel super curl that that is like everyday stuff you get to take that one everyday
[03:02:44] get on the subscription thing but these you know all this other stuff actually all of it like
[03:02:48] is that all of it or do me dot com also at origin main I'll tell you what there's on there is
[03:02:53] geese for you jitsu very important when you start jiu jitsu or if you already started
[03:02:59] jiu jitsu you need a geet people still ask good and I'm glad they do because I got the answer
[03:03:06] from what geet do I get I start jiu jitsu what geet do I get sometimes I ask a color and that's
[03:03:11] all different question but they say what brand of geet here's a brand origin brand 100% made in America
[03:03:17] best these are the geets that like peat and all that when they make them they take into consideration
[03:03:24] all the movements of jiu jitsu like everything even down to this and think about we might not even
[03:03:29] thought about it like outside of when you put this on okay so in a regular geet they have the string
[03:03:35] to tie on the pants not to belt the string on the pants then you have a belt they go
[03:03:39] over the the geetop all that stuff no that's string fine were you still it fine there's a cool string
[03:03:46] but you ever like put in the dryer or you got caught on something or whatever and that string gets
[03:03:50] lost in the little tooth later I don't even know how you you'd like but you see them saying right
[03:03:55] yeah good project and that's a good idea that'll happen to your hoodie and you gotta get the
[03:03:58] hanger and you gotta do this big thing if you even know how otherwise you're kind of screwed
[03:04:03] in away because you gotta go all up in there now take the origin geet these are just these details
[03:04:07] that when you get someone who's thinking of this kind of stuff when they design the whole geet
[03:04:11] you got some geet there that this is one of the many reasons why you get the origin geet this one
[03:04:16] the string comes out that's okay because it's not this this endless black hole loop holder
[03:04:22] I don't want you to say yeah it's like it'll have like it's like giant thick wide bell loops yeah
[03:04:28] and a bunch of them too so you have like you know it's it's so easy to put them in that's even
[03:04:33] if you even want the string if you don't want the string you're like hey I don't I'm I'm over strings
[03:04:37] I don't like tying my string they give you this little bit you see if you have origin geet you're like
[03:04:42] you're exactly exactly like a little lock yeah well yeah yeah I'm a belt it's a teeny it's a thin
[03:04:48] belt that goes through and click you click the belt make it tighter whatever's like a little mini belt
[03:04:54] you don't you don't feel it when you're rolling nothing like that did you think you're going to
[03:04:57] feel it when you were old it was a question there was a question for me to I thought I'd you know
[03:05:02] this seems kind of weird yeah and then you put it on you don't you don't notice it all you don't
[03:05:06] notice until it comes time to take it off and it's so easy yeah you're like boom and here's the
[03:05:10] thing again it's like we probably never really thought of this until you actually do it like
[03:05:15] after when you when you're done you don't really think about it but it's just one of those things
[03:05:18] or like dang this is good these are good these are good these are good keys one of the many details
[03:05:23] yeah included I was talking to a guy yesterday I was getting interviewed and I said there's a
[03:05:30] world you know I he's asking me about all my different businesses right whatever that means all
[03:05:35] opinion yeah yeah and I said we know I have a parallel company and we make we make a parallel
[03:05:43] up in Maine got a big factory up in Maine he says oh up in Maine that's up in Maine a factory in Maine
[03:05:50] and you know I was like yeah and he was all surprised and I said you know what it's sad that you're
[03:05:55] surprised at that because 50 years ago everybody knew that that's where they made stuff they made it
[03:06:03] up there and it all disappeared and now it's coming back and we're bringing it back I told this guy
[03:06:08] it's a spring in a back we're bringing back made effect we got what weaving material up there
[03:06:12] you know what that you don't even know what I'm talking about people's first instinct is like oh
[03:06:16] if you want material you got to go to overseas and you got to have you got to get it made some
[03:06:20] sweatshop somewhere right that's literally what that's that's that's accepted right that's
[03:06:25] except oh you just you know hey you can't beat those prices and you can't you can't overcome the
[03:06:30] the tariffs and whatever else no you know what yes you can yes you can't and we are we're doing it
[03:06:36] yeah you get the cotton in like North Carolina you're screwed up he's own South Carolina
[03:06:42] I believe I'm screwed it up too get the cotton in America one of the car in America in America
[03:06:47] since the thing is they just talked to Peter and I'm pretty sure he said North could have been
[03:06:50] South I don't know I forget I apologize nonetheless it is in America just like how you said and
[03:06:57] then they bring it up and here's what it is to the secret they have their looms they have their own looms
[03:07:01] yeah you can't just walk into the store and start buying looms you just can't do that that's why it's hard to you
[03:07:06] know to kind that's why they have a unique situation there what's all mean in America and hey everyone that is
[03:07:11] supporting us at origin thank you because right now you know what we're doing we're expanding
[03:07:18] we're buying more machines we're buying better equipment and we're hiring more people so thank you
[03:07:23] for your support it's awesome we're only able to bring manufacturing back to America because of you knowing
[03:07:31] that you want to have the best and you want to make America so thanks everyone yeah thank you second
[03:07:35] that much appreciated yeah that's the one origin main dot com lot of cool stuff on there some
[03:07:42] hoodies not to mention the most comfortable pants in the world officially no officially I'm wearing
[03:07:46] the right now we go to L.A today good fine you know whatever but you're going to want to wear
[03:07:51] something comfortable this is my thought process before we went and so I'm going to wear the most
[03:07:54] comfortable thing that I own straight up no question may origin pants but anyway also like I said
[03:08:03] geese rashcards compression gear and whatnot you know it just go there or gymnasium dot com get what you want
[03:08:09] also the emerging camps jiu jitsu camp you did to immersion camp not concentration camp not not
[03:08:15] necessarily uh summer camp not band camp not band camp no it's like an immersion can't immerse yourself
[03:08:23] in jiu jitsu you train as much or as little as you want but you get to be in jiu jitsu the whole time but
[03:08:27] one week two sessions you can do both if you want but I'll be there I will be there maybe not
[03:08:34] at full capacity the jiu jiu a lot of now we're going to see about some stuff long story
[03:08:38] day work life looks like life's a go j p working it well a lot of cool fun people will be there
[03:08:50] it's going to be a good good time um if last year is any indicators to be real good time also
[03:08:57] if you want to vary up your work out you want to get some kettlebells like some someone just
[03:09:02] text me today well you know on dm okay what weight kettlebells should I use okay here's a
[03:09:09] thing that's a broad question yeah it's a real broad so who are you exactly right yeah it's actually
[03:09:15] it's an easy answer what's that I didn't think or to the 48 kilogram once yeah yeah so
[03:09:22] and potentially kill yourself or some smash it on your toe because you can hold it or it's too
[03:09:26] light for you I don't know just depends so depends on how much you know about using
[03:09:31] kettlebells depends how strong your depends on how big you are and it depends on what kind of
[03:09:37] yeah all this kind of it well it does know depends on what kind of fitness you are trying to achieve
[03:09:42] yeah I guess because you're trying to get big and strong you want to get a bigger go about if you're
[03:09:46] trying to get more more metcon conditioning and whatnot than you get maybe a smaller kettlebell
[03:09:52] yeah maybe medium or something like that the last point is hey it depends depends but
[03:09:58] here's the thing I will say this and say this with complete bias because that because the
[03:10:02] on it kettlebells on it those are the kettlebells you get regardless of what size you get the
[03:10:07] Rc primal bell ones that's that's one you get either just way cooler also if you want
[03:10:16] to vary up we're work out like I said no boring workouts jokka doesn't have boring workouts apparently
[03:10:22] but he did he doesn't I know but you want to make your workouts interesting different movements
[03:10:27] it's functional strength and actual strength there's other stuff on there starting with like
[03:10:32] it's a spectrum it goes from jump ropes all the way up to what mate steel bells what's a steel
[03:10:38] bell they look like a frisbee right but there's filled with metal but what do you do with them
[03:10:44] all kinds of stuff right see there that's the point so there's a bunch of stuff on there anyway
[03:10:47] a lot of good stuff a lot of um what did I just get that were pretty cool oh the socks boom on it socks
[03:10:54] on it socks straight up yeah there's a lot of lot of cool stuff on there on there a lot of good
[03:10:58] information on there too so a lot of the questions that are directed at me I don't know the answer
[03:11:02] I sometimes don't know the answer for me as a place of me some stuff I heard but it's real

[03:12:29] on there try to post every day try to sometimes two a day try to also on there is enhanced
[03:12:38] excerpts you know what I mean by that I know what you mean by what I mean you mean you put some
[03:12:43] cinematography into the scenario you film and then you edit with music and other special effects
[03:12:50] CGI and what not sure well at the very least I'll put some music on there you know make it
[03:12:56] things are exploding sometimes sometimes you read the war path videos so there's no longer
[03:13:02] horrible Christmas not horrible see I put Christmas music on that because it was christian
[03:13:07] time and there's no ever do that again you want to get christmas spirit watch the watch the christmas
[03:13:12] nineteen fourteen yeah that's a good one as well and that's better christmas spirit is real
[03:13:17] christmas spirit yeah you know unless that's why I did it but look you make a good point
[03:13:23] a what you can be fair never put christmas music in one of my what do they call excerpts oh
[03:13:29] now the yours oh okay I'm in it I'm in it I'm not in it I'm not in it I'm not in it I'm not in it
[03:13:37] don't put christmas music in our excerpts all right you got it I promise otherwise that year
[03:13:43] excerpts yeah I got to take down actually all right I dig it and you know so it's not going to be
[03:13:49] christmas everyday otherwise man once that's not christmas everyday so why put christmas music on something
[03:13:54] someone might may or may not listen to everyday so I understand so yeah are we did it you know revamp
[03:14:00] some stuff sometimes you know listen to it everyday FYI my wife completely stuck up for you on that
[03:14:07] one yeah because yeah it's nice christmas music it was released that christmas time okay I just went into
[03:14:14] like hiding yeah it's kind of a bummer too because that was a really I know you put a lot of
[03:14:19] time and effort into that video it took a little while so that so then when you showed it to me
[03:14:23] you were all excited and and the video CGI stuff is awesome right but I know that you wanted
[03:14:33] me to be just you know over the top with filled with awe at the video and I was with the visuals
[03:14:43] but I was that was a lot of that was countered by christmas songs and so what you saw from my
[03:14:50] reaction was actually fake yeah it was fairly fake there was a fair amount of realness there
[03:14:55] and I remember it and I won't forget it because you and because you know you go let me a little bit
[03:15:01] inside where you all kind of like format where it does like a certain thing and then it'll drop off
[03:15:06] then it'll come back whatever so there's this part where the certain parts starts at a
[03:15:11] Michael he's gonna he's gonna kind of like that part right so I'm kind of so I kind of look over at you
[03:15:15] it's a super childish but I'm like looking at you whatever and you're like looking at it and then
[03:15:20] like when that part hit and it's christmas music you're like kind of like as if to say
[03:15:25] interesting choice instead of you know you're like oh anyway so rough we changed the
[03:15:36] christmas music as a result so boom anyway that one that's a hit video of all time yeah sure
[03:15:42] anyway yeah so yeah enhanced excerpts that's us on there along with of course the video version of
[03:15:47] this podcast if you care the jockel looks like also jockel is a store it's called jockel store
[03:15:53] you're a jockel store dot com so obviously I know not that creative but still cool stuff on there
[03:16:00] stuff is creative I think so going there shirts hats we even got a new hat it's like a flex fit now
[03:16:08] boom a lot of people been asking for that delivered gladly delivered anyway who is on there like I
[03:16:15] said rash guards women stuff some new mugs you know what I think I'm put the t on there so if
[03:16:24] you know if they want to have that option to get jockel white t and international you know oh yeah
[03:16:29] I think you know just more options we're convenient for the people good call for everybody I think
[03:16:35] nonetheless a lot of stuff on there uh if you want something just get something also psychological warfare
[03:16:43] if you didn't know what that is it's an album with tracks jockel tracks I know that sounds like
[03:16:50] okay it's kind of esoteric jockel tracks what does that mean here this what it means it means it's
[03:16:54] not him seeing nothing like that so in your home in your in your campaign against weakness and we're
[03:17:00] all on the path straight it's it's like common knowledge ready all of us were on the path like if you're
[03:17:05] with we're listening to this even me talking you listening me we're on the path all of us one great
[03:17:10] now this is inevitable I think for the most part inevitable where you know hit moments of weakness
[03:17:18] sometimes you need a little help through those moments of weakness sometimes you need to just slip
[03:17:23] in those moments of weakness and fall and be like I'm not doing that again sometimes that's useful
[03:17:27] you learn in my opinion but in those moments of weakness where you just need a little spot this is
[03:17:33] what jockel tracks are for so let's say your weakness is not getting up early you want to hit the
[03:17:38] snooze so what you want to do to tie it on a note whatever maybe drink a little bit I don't know
[03:17:45] so you're on the fence you're like I'm gonna hit the snooze just for what what's the normal
[03:17:49] snooze 10 minutes nine minutes whatever I don't know seems to be good to tell me about that
[03:17:57] there's a mud over here it's true rotten anyway actually it's not for the snooze technically it's
[03:18:02] not for hitting the snooze it's for going back to bed that's the weakness that this
[03:18:07] particular track because hitting the snooze is like if you just want to hit the snooze you're not
[03:18:12] gonna have the energy to get up and you know boom maybe if you put it as your alarm nonetheless
[03:18:16] is what it is the track it's jockel on a specific track telling you why you should just get up and
[03:18:21] not hit the snooze or not stay in bed but it's like jockel pragmatic advice it's good
[03:18:27] hundred percent and this goes for diet stuff skip you work out stuff hundred percent effective
[03:18:33] this hundred percent that's good speaking of a hundred percent if you 100 percent one hundred
[03:18:39] percent guaranteed want to be able to deadlift eight thousand pounds minimum you might go over that
[03:18:45] all you have to do is drink chocolate it's that simple bro okay and the kids good
[03:18:51] I'm gonna get sued am I gonna get sued for false advertising no because so in here's why so this
[03:18:57] kid jociah this is an huge guy towards bicep by the way a few weeks ago maybe a few months ago
