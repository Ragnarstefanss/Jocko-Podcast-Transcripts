00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.68
This is Jockel Podcast number 40 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:07.68 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening, echo.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.32
Good evening.

4
00:00:12.32 --> 00:00:21.08
And the last podcast that we did, I went a little long with the book.

5
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:29.84
The book was Brave Men by a guy named Ernie Pile and there was

6
00:00:29.84 --> 00:00:34.08
just some incredible writing in there that I just went deep with.

7
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:37.40
I read it all.

8
00:00:37.40 --> 00:00:43.92
And so we had to postpone the Q&A.

9
00:00:43.92 --> 00:00:46.48
So that's okay.

10
00:00:46.48 --> 00:00:49.64
Give us some time here to give us some time here to go.

11
00:00:49.64 --> 00:00:51.64
A little deep on some Q&A.

12
00:00:51.64 --> 00:00:54.40
This is podcast number 40 by the way.

13
00:00:54.40 --> 00:01:00.52
Pretty weak straight who wants some 40 weak straight is where we're at.

14
00:01:00.52 --> 00:01:04.20
And that's apparently that's the battle rhythm here.

15
00:01:04.20 --> 00:01:11.48
We put out podcasts and we do it weekly and we've been doing it for 40 straight weeks.

16
00:01:11.48 --> 00:01:13.48
And I dig that.

17
00:01:13.48 --> 00:01:14.76
Yeah, it's good.

18
00:01:14.76 --> 00:01:19.04
And it's not always easy.

19
00:01:19.04 --> 00:01:22.92
You know because if you think about the times, think about the times when you're not

20
00:01:22.92 --> 00:01:25.76
doing anything.

21
00:01:25.76 --> 00:01:29.56
Well, you're not doing anything or when I would normally not be doing anything.

22
00:01:29.56 --> 00:01:31.56
For 40 weeks, I've been doing something.

23
00:01:31.56 --> 00:01:32.56
I've been reading.

24
00:01:32.56 --> 00:01:33.56
I've been prepping.

25
00:01:33.56 --> 00:01:34.96
I've been researching.

26
00:01:34.96 --> 00:01:37.16
So 40 weeks is legit.

27
00:01:37.16 --> 00:01:40.04
And I'm stoked that we're at number 40.

28
00:01:40.04 --> 00:01:41.84
Me too.

29
00:01:41.84 --> 00:01:46.80
And now we get to talk about some questions from the interwebs.

30
00:01:46.80 --> 00:01:52.76
So thanks to everybody for giving us the awesome questions through Twitter, through Facebook.

31
00:01:52.76 --> 00:01:55.60
It's pretty much where they come from, Twitter and Facebook.

32
00:01:55.60 --> 00:01:57.000
I guess I get a couple emails.

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.92
I get texts to from like some of my buddies and the SEAL teams don't hit me up with

34
00:02:01.92 --> 00:02:02.92
a question here and there.

35
00:02:02.92 --> 00:02:05.000
A lot of times I just respond to them.

36
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.28
Get real.

37
00:02:07.28 --> 00:02:11.52
Sometimes I use them.

38
00:02:11.52 --> 00:02:13.80
But anyways, yeah, let's get to it.

39
00:02:13.80 --> 00:02:15.80
Let's do it.

40
00:02:15.80 --> 00:02:17.84
Okay, juggle.

41
00:02:17.84 --> 00:02:22.40
First question from the vote.

42
00:02:22.40 --> 00:02:24.08
I've got a lot of questions.

43
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:25.08
Got a big vote.

44
00:02:25.08 --> 00:02:26.08
Got a big vote.

45
00:02:26.08 --> 00:02:29.60
And so I was just trying to go through and make sure there wasn't any questions or just

46
00:02:29.60 --> 00:02:32.76
review questions that might be good that I missed the first time around.

47
00:02:32.76 --> 00:02:34.68
So this one right here is from the vote.

48
00:02:34.68 --> 00:02:36.64
It's from the old school to the question.

49
00:02:36.64 --> 00:02:39.60
Yeah, one that you always intended to maybe revisit.

50
00:02:39.60 --> 00:02:40.60
Yes.

51
00:02:40.60 --> 00:02:41.60
And we go revisiting it.

52
00:02:41.60 --> 00:02:42.60
Yes.

53
00:02:42.60 --> 00:02:45.92
Let the revisit begin.

54
00:02:45.92 --> 00:02:46.92
Started jiu-jitsu.

55
00:02:46.92 --> 00:02:48.64
Thanks to you.

56
00:02:48.64 --> 00:02:53.60
Many tips for complementary exercises, especially for non-athletics of

57
00:02:53.60 --> 00:02:57.88
William, what's the hardest stage of your and what's the hardest stage of your jiu-jitsu

58
00:02:57.88 --> 00:02:58.88
journey.

59
00:02:58.88 --> 00:03:01.40
Yeah, and that's actually for, that's actually it was two questions.

60
00:03:01.40 --> 00:03:06.64
I'll find them in the one because they're kind of similar.

61
00:03:06.64 --> 00:03:11.04
And okay, so do you just want to think that's called much jiu-jitsu?

62
00:03:11.04 --> 00:03:17.52
Is it say it's a very well-rounded physical activity, right?

63
00:03:17.52 --> 00:03:18.84
You've got to have flexibility.

64
00:03:18.84 --> 00:03:19.84
You've got to have strength.

65
00:03:19.84 --> 00:03:20.84
You've got to have endurance.

66
00:03:20.84 --> 00:03:24.64
You've got to be able to recover quickly when from fatigue.

67
00:03:24.64 --> 00:03:31.32
You've got to have some agility, speed, balance, coordination,

68
00:03:31.32 --> 00:03:36.36
proprioception, you know, proprioceptionist.

69
00:03:36.36 --> 00:03:40.48
It's knowing where your body is in space.

70
00:03:40.48 --> 00:03:41.48
Sure.

71
00:03:41.48 --> 00:03:46.28
And it's a talent that gymnasts have very well.

72
00:03:46.28 --> 00:03:47.28
Yes.

73
00:03:47.28 --> 00:03:49.96
Maybe a dancer has very well.

74
00:03:49.96 --> 00:03:53.48
They know where their body is in space.

75
00:03:53.48 --> 00:03:57.40
And jiu-jitsu demands that you know where your body is at all times.

76
00:03:57.40 --> 00:04:00.44
So that's the stuff that you need to work on all those things.

77
00:04:00.44 --> 00:04:01.64
All those things.

78
00:04:01.64 --> 00:04:03.88
Because jiu-jitsu is a unique test of all those things.

79
00:04:03.88 --> 00:04:04.88
It's a test of your strength.

80
00:04:04.88 --> 00:04:05.88
It's a test of your flexible.

81
00:04:05.88 --> 00:04:07.28
It's a test of your endurance.

82
00:04:07.28 --> 00:04:10.20
It's a test of your ability to recover.

83
00:04:10.20 --> 00:04:12.08
It's a test of your agility.

84
00:04:12.08 --> 00:04:13.84
It's a test of your speed of your coordination.

85
00:04:13.84 --> 00:04:15.48
It's a test of all those things.

86
00:04:15.48 --> 00:04:25.32
So that makes it a really good sport to practice in my opinion.

87
00:04:25.32 --> 00:04:28.76
So what do you need to do?

88
00:04:28.76 --> 00:04:32.12
What do you need to do to train them?

89
00:04:32.12 --> 00:04:34.64
Did you need to train all those things?

90
00:04:34.64 --> 00:04:39.16
So for flexibility, I personally like the mobility

91
00:04:39.16 --> 00:04:46.16
of the body.

92
00:04:46.16 --> 00:04:49.16
But you know, get some kind of stretching protocol.

93
00:04:49.16 --> 00:04:52.16
Gymnastics types, movements.

94
00:04:52.16 --> 00:04:56.16
There's gymnastics bodies, which is a ridiculously good protocol.

95
00:04:56.16 --> 00:04:57.16
You can go on.

96
00:04:57.16 --> 00:04:59.16
It's an internet thing.

97
00:04:59.16 --> 00:05:00.16
Gymnasticspotters.com.

98
00:05:00.16 --> 00:05:01.16
And what does that like?

99
00:05:01.16 --> 00:05:02.16
Workout.

100
00:05:02.16 --> 00:05:03.16
Yeah, it's a workout.

101
00:05:03.16 --> 00:05:04.16
It's flexibility.

102
00:05:04.16 --> 00:05:05.16
Yeah.

103
00:05:05.16 --> 00:05:07.16
It's hard core.

104
00:05:07.16 --> 00:05:08.16
It's hard core.

105
00:05:08.16 --> 00:05:09.16
But that's really good.

106
00:05:09.16 --> 00:05:11.16
You know, you'll get your flex.

107
00:05:11.16 --> 00:05:13.16
You get all kinds of stuff from that.

108
00:05:13.16 --> 00:05:16.16
But so you've got to be flexible.

109
00:05:16.16 --> 00:05:17.16
You've got to work on your flexibility.

110
00:05:17.16 --> 00:05:18.16
So what are you going to do?

111
00:05:18.16 --> 00:05:20.16
Like I said, you're going to do mobility water.

112
00:05:20.16 --> 00:05:22.16
Some kind of stretching protocol.

113
00:05:22.16 --> 00:05:23.16
So you get limber.

114
00:05:23.16 --> 00:05:25.16
You've got to work on your strength.

115
00:05:25.16 --> 00:05:26.16
So what do you do?

116
00:05:26.16 --> 00:05:27.16
Work on strength?

117
00:05:27.16 --> 00:05:28.16
Olympic lifting.

118
00:05:28.16 --> 00:05:29.16
What does that?

119
00:05:29.16 --> 00:05:32.16
Clean and jerk snatches.

120
00:05:32.16 --> 00:05:35.16
That brings in things like cleans by themselves.

121
00:05:35.16 --> 00:05:38.16
You know, presses and hand cleans and all that.

122
00:05:38.16 --> 00:05:43.16
And then on top of that for strength, you also have the simple movements.

123
00:05:43.16 --> 00:05:46.16
The deadlift, the squat, the front squat, the overhead squat.

124
00:05:46.16 --> 00:05:48.16
And also for strength.

125
00:05:48.16 --> 00:05:51.16
You can go back to gymnastics again.

126
00:05:51.16 --> 00:05:54.16
Go back to those gymnastics movements.

127
00:05:54.16 --> 00:05:57.16
And basic calisthenics.

128
00:05:57.16 --> 00:05:59.16
Pull ups, push ups, dips.

129
00:05:59.16 --> 00:06:01.16
Squats, flutter kicks.

130
00:06:01.16 --> 00:06:03.16
That whole nine yards.

131
00:06:03.16 --> 00:06:06.16
Now you got to have endurance, right?

132
00:06:06.16 --> 00:06:07.16
So what do you do for endurance?

133
00:06:07.16 --> 00:06:09.16
You can see where this is heading.

134
00:06:09.16 --> 00:06:11.16
For endurance, what do you got to do?

135
00:06:11.16 --> 00:06:12.16
Run, swim bike.

136
00:06:12.16 --> 00:06:14.16
Some kind of matcon.

137
00:06:14.16 --> 00:06:16.16
I like the matcon personally.

138
00:06:16.16 --> 00:06:22.16
For my cardio vascular endurance and recovery and whatnot.

139
00:06:22.16 --> 00:06:28.16
You know, so yes, you can, you can add running and sprinting into those.

140
00:06:28.16 --> 00:06:29.16
You can sprint swimming.

141
00:06:29.16 --> 00:06:32.16
You can sprint on a bike.

142
00:06:32.16 --> 00:06:36.16
You can use cattle bells to work your matcombs scenario.

143
00:06:36.16 --> 00:06:40.16
You can actually use barbells to do matcons.

144
00:06:40.16 --> 00:06:44.16
You know, do a bunch of cleans and you will get tired.

145
00:06:44.16 --> 00:06:50.16
And then with that, when you work on your endurance, that thereby improves your recovery.

146
00:06:50.16 --> 00:06:54.16
And so that's, that's going to help you there.

147
00:06:54.16 --> 00:06:57.16
Then you have agility and for agility, what do you do?

148
00:06:57.16 --> 00:07:01.16
To some sports, some cross training of sports.

149
00:07:01.16 --> 00:07:04.16
I personally like to serve.

150
00:07:04.16 --> 00:07:07.16
But you know, it's not just that.

151
00:07:07.16 --> 00:07:09.16
It's basketball.

152
00:07:09.16 --> 00:07:13.16
It's go play soccer, go hockey baseball, whatever set you work on your agility.

153
00:07:13.16 --> 00:07:15.16
You need to get your speed and I already talked about this.

154
00:07:15.16 --> 00:07:20.16
You got your running, your sprinting, the air bike or whatever.

155
00:07:20.16 --> 00:07:26.16
The proprioception, the gymnastics, the movement, type things,

156
00:07:26.16 --> 00:07:28.16
or you're holding your body in space.

157
00:07:28.16 --> 00:07:31.16
So that's a lot of stuff.

158
00:07:31.16 --> 00:07:34.16
That's a lot of stuff.

159
00:07:34.16 --> 00:07:36.16
And you pile all that together.

160
00:07:36.16 --> 00:07:42.16
And you got a lot of varied, varied activity.

161
00:07:42.16 --> 00:07:45.16
And what's nice about that is when people talk about getting burnt out,

162
00:07:45.16 --> 00:07:46.16
I'm like, I never get burnt out.

163
00:07:46.16 --> 00:07:47.16
I'm working out.

164
00:07:47.16 --> 00:07:51.16
I got 97 different base exercises that I can use.

165
00:07:51.16 --> 00:07:53.16
I'm not going to get burned out.

166
00:07:53.16 --> 00:07:56.16
So it, and what's fun is you jump into these challenges.

167
00:07:56.16 --> 00:07:59.16
Like, or you find something that's challenging that you can't do.

168
00:07:59.16 --> 00:08:01.16
And you go, okay, well, I'm going to try and do that.

169
00:08:01.16 --> 00:08:03.16
I'm going to see what I can get my weight up to on this.

170
00:08:03.16 --> 00:08:06.16
I'm going to see if I can do this movement in gymnastics.

171
00:08:06.16 --> 00:08:09.16
I'm going to see if I can do this many pull ups or whatever.

172
00:08:09.16 --> 00:08:13.16
You keep continually varying and heading in a different direction.

173
00:08:13.16 --> 00:08:16.16
And I think I think when you combine all those things together,

174
00:08:16.16 --> 00:08:21.16
and you become a well rounded athlete, that is what will help you the most with the GJ2.

175
00:08:21.16 --> 00:08:24.16
Well, but I don't think there's one exercise like, hey, this will help you.

176
00:08:24.16 --> 00:08:28.16
And GJ2, although the clean and jerk is pretty good.

177
00:08:28.16 --> 00:08:29.16
Yeah.

178
00:08:29.16 --> 00:08:33.16
And anything with, like, your body weight.

179
00:08:33.16 --> 00:08:37.16
So because like, in GJ2, when you're doing GJ2, that's mainly what it is.

180
00:08:37.16 --> 00:08:42.16
Sure, there are elements where you're trying to control someone else's body weight.

181
00:08:42.16 --> 00:08:44.16
But it's mainly what you're doing with your body.

182
00:08:44.16 --> 00:08:48.16
So like, when you do, you know, like this, this, when you climb up.

183
00:08:48.16 --> 00:08:49.16
Oh, the pegboard.

184
00:08:49.16 --> 00:08:51.16
Yeah, yeah, like that kind of stuff.

185
00:08:51.16 --> 00:08:54.16
The bars, all the gymnastics stuff.

186
00:08:54.16 --> 00:08:58.16
And then, as far as like being strong in these weird,

187
00:08:58.16 --> 00:09:01.16
because that's essentially what you're going to be doing in GJ2, you know.

188
00:09:01.16 --> 00:09:04.16
There is, there is, though, there is in GJ2.

189
00:09:04.16 --> 00:09:07.16
You're oftentimes you're moving someone else's weight, too.

190
00:09:07.16 --> 00:09:08.16
Yeah.

191
00:09:08.16 --> 00:09:10.16
And guys that are super explosive.

192
00:09:10.16 --> 00:09:13.16
That's a different thing to deal with.

193
00:09:13.16 --> 00:09:17.16
And it's a good trait to have to be super explosive.

194
00:09:17.16 --> 00:09:21.16
So you can combine that with what, like, when you shrink out in someone.

195
00:09:21.16 --> 00:09:22.16
Yeah.

196
00:09:22.16 --> 00:09:24.16
Sure, something's going to be strong holding you, but when you shrink,

197
00:09:24.16 --> 00:09:25.16
you're pushing your own body weight.

198
00:09:25.16 --> 00:09:27.16
That's your own body weight.

199
00:09:27.16 --> 00:09:27.16
Sure.

200
00:09:27.16 --> 00:09:27.16
Sure.

201
00:09:27.16 --> 00:09:29.16
You add his own, that's your width of that.

202
00:09:29.16 --> 00:09:30.16
That's just kind of part of the game.

203
00:09:30.16 --> 00:09:33.16
But if you can control your own body in these,

204
00:09:33.16 --> 00:09:37.16
stronger ways, that's going to give like such a big benefit.

205
00:09:37.16 --> 00:09:39.16
So then, then to your Olympic lifting.

206
00:09:39.16 --> 00:09:44.16
To me, that's, in my opinion, that's probably one of the best ones.

207
00:09:44.16 --> 00:09:45.16
Olympic.

208
00:09:45.16 --> 00:09:46.16
And this is why.

209
00:09:46.16 --> 00:09:52.16
Not only do you get that little, little explosive movements in there,

210
00:09:52.16 --> 00:09:58.16
but when you put Olympic lifting to make up your metcon,

211
00:09:58.16 --> 00:10:02.16
when you do like a clean, like a clean press, right?

212
00:10:02.16 --> 00:10:06.16
You, your muscle work is just for a second.

213
00:10:06.16 --> 00:10:08.16
And then for a second, it's almost kind of relax.

214
00:10:08.16 --> 00:10:12.16
And then boom again, and then it's kind of relax, and then you hold and boom,

215
00:10:12.16 --> 00:10:13.16
and it's just repetitive.

216
00:10:13.16 --> 00:10:14.16
That feels like you did to you.

217
00:10:14.16 --> 00:10:16.16
That's kind of what you just can be.

218
00:10:16.16 --> 00:10:18.16
Do you think that's going to be a good thing?

219
00:10:18.16 --> 00:10:19.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:10:19.16 --> 00:10:22.16
So, and if you're in shape in that way, where you can go hard,

221
00:10:22.16 --> 00:10:25.16
rest for just a little bit, and then go hard again,

222
00:10:25.16 --> 00:10:27.16
if that's kind of, if you can do that,

223
00:10:27.16 --> 00:10:30.16
if you're in that kind of shape, that's going to help.

224
00:10:30.16 --> 00:10:33.16
So when you do, when you do a metcon or circuit training,

225
00:10:33.16 --> 00:10:36.16
something like that, where if you can do the exercise,

226
00:10:36.16 --> 00:10:39.16
dynamic rest, like active rest,

227
00:10:39.16 --> 00:10:42.16
you know, where you're walking, or even jogging kind of,

228
00:10:42.16 --> 00:10:43.16
that's what you just do.

229
00:10:43.16 --> 00:10:46.16
It's like work, and you're never really just laying there.

230
00:10:46.16 --> 00:10:49.16
You know, do that kind of thing, and do it in like rounds.

231
00:10:49.16 --> 00:10:51.16
If you're into like a 10 minute round, and you did to,

232
00:10:51.16 --> 00:10:53.16
and that's really your thing, then do your circuit training,

233
00:10:53.16 --> 00:10:54.16
10 minute rounds.

234
00:10:54.16 --> 00:10:56.16
You know, it'll like, it'll help.

235
00:10:56.16 --> 00:10:58.16
It'll get you kind of aware of like,

236
00:10:58.16 --> 00:11:01.16
okay, I'm this tired, I got a manage, you know, all this stuff.

237
00:11:01.16 --> 00:11:02.16
No, but yeah, I agree.

238
00:11:02.16 --> 00:11:05.16
I think metcon swimming, oh, swimming.

239
00:11:05.16 --> 00:11:08.16
But if you do swimming sprints, because it's like your old body.

240
00:11:08.16 --> 00:11:12.16
You know, especially the less, the less comfortable you are in the water,

241
00:11:12.16 --> 00:11:17.16
the more of those swimming things are going to be challenging for you.

242
00:11:17.16 --> 00:11:17.16
Yeah.

243
00:11:17.16 --> 00:11:19.16
But I speak in a little Olympic love.

244
00:11:19.16 --> 00:11:21.16
Do you know, do you know Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo?

245
00:11:21.16 --> 00:11:22.16
Yeah.

246
00:11:22.16 --> 00:11:23.16
Have you returned with him?

247
00:11:23.16 --> 00:11:24.16
No.

248
00:11:24.16 --> 00:11:27.16
So Mo, Mo, Mo, if, for those of you listening that don't know Mo,

249
00:11:27.16 --> 00:11:30.16
as he's a really incredibly good rest,

250
00:11:30.16 --> 00:11:32.16
let me rest a little in college, and he,

251
00:11:32.16 --> 00:11:37.16
is, he didn't, he didn't make the Olympic games,

252
00:11:37.16 --> 00:11:39.16
but he was like in second.

253
00:11:39.16 --> 00:11:41.16
He almost made the Olympic game, but he's a big guy,

254
00:11:41.16 --> 00:11:44.16
so he's, you know, like, 205 pounds.

255
00:11:44.16 --> 00:11:52.16
And he is, I think he is the most explosive person

256
00:11:52.16 --> 00:11:58.16
I've ever trained with when I've trained with some unbelievably

257
00:11:58.16 --> 00:12:00.16
incredibly explosive people.

258
00:12:00.16 --> 00:12:05.16
And you'll find that if anybody wrestled on a high high level,

259
00:12:05.16 --> 00:12:09.16
like if they were a high level college wrestler,

260
00:12:09.16 --> 00:12:12.16
there's a likely chance that they're very explosive.

261
00:12:12.16 --> 00:12:14.16
But yeah, they're very explosive.

262
00:12:14.16 --> 00:12:19.16
And Mo is explosive to a crazy level.

263
00:12:19.16 --> 00:12:22.16
But the reason I thought of it when you said Olympic lifts is

264
00:12:22.16 --> 00:12:25.16
one time he was just trying to help it with some takedowns,

265
00:12:25.16 --> 00:12:28.16
and he was the way he was exploding into him.

266
00:12:28.16 --> 00:12:30.16
And he, he was all fired up, he's like, you know,

267
00:12:30.16 --> 00:12:32.16
it's like, when you do a clean and jerk,

268
00:12:32.16 --> 00:12:34.16
he goes, this right here is the beginning of it.

269
00:12:34.16 --> 00:12:37.16
And he's, you could see that he's developing so much explosiveness.

270
00:12:37.16 --> 00:12:40.16
The first time I ever trained with him, Dean,

271
00:12:40.16 --> 00:12:44.16
Dean, Dean, I can never read Dean with,

272
00:12:44.16 --> 00:12:47.16
when he sets me to train with somebody.

273
00:12:47.16 --> 00:12:48.16
He doesn't give me a heads up.

274
00:12:48.16 --> 00:12:50.16
Like if I were going to tell you,

275
00:12:50.16 --> 00:12:52.16
if there was, like, let's say there was a guy that was a really good

276
00:12:52.16 --> 00:12:55.16
wrestler, and I go, I go, hey, echo, train with a guy

277
00:12:55.16 --> 00:12:57.16
where, hey, he's a really good wrestler.

278
00:12:57.16 --> 00:12:59.16
And if he used, I might even say,

279
00:12:59.16 --> 00:13:01.16
I'm going to say, hey man, he's a really good wrestler,

280
00:13:01.16 --> 00:13:02.16
and he's got a sick, guillotine.

281
00:13:02.16 --> 00:13:04.16
So you're like thinking about it, right?

282
00:13:04.16 --> 00:13:06.16
I'm going to give you a little heads up.

283
00:13:06.16 --> 00:13:10.16
Dean just goes, hey, you should train with him, right?

284
00:13:10.16 --> 00:13:12.16
That's what Dean does.

285
00:13:12.16 --> 00:13:15.16
And so anyways, he did tell me on this occasion,

286
00:13:15.16 --> 00:13:17.16
he goes, hey, most coming down,

287
00:13:17.16 --> 00:13:20.16
you've got to train with him, he's a really sick wrestler.

288
00:13:20.16 --> 00:13:21.16
And I go, awesome.

289
00:13:21.16 --> 00:13:24.16
I think of myself, oh cool, you know?

290
00:13:24.16 --> 00:13:28.16
I actually, for a guy that didn't wrestle in high school,

291
00:13:28.16 --> 00:13:31.16
I have decent take down defense

292
00:13:31.16 --> 00:13:34.16
because I've been defending take down for a long time.

293
00:13:34.16 --> 00:13:36.16
And I utilize jujitsu to defend my take down.

294
00:13:36.16 --> 00:13:38.16
So I'm sprawling in guillotine and going for a community

295
00:13:38.16 --> 00:13:41.16
or I'm doing active aggressive jujitsu moves to people

296
00:13:41.16 --> 00:13:43.16
when they're trying to take me down.

297
00:13:43.16 --> 00:13:47.16
So I'm not trying to say I have any major skills there,

298
00:13:47.16 --> 00:13:50.16
but I'm not a slouch to take down.

299
00:13:50.16 --> 00:13:52.16
So I figured, hey, I got a good wrestler cool.

300
00:13:52.16 --> 00:13:54.16
And he wasn't that experienced in jujitsu,

301
00:13:54.16 --> 00:13:56.16
which tells you, okay, good cool, you know,

302
00:13:56.16 --> 00:13:57.16
you're going to guillotine this guy.

303
00:13:57.16 --> 00:14:00.16
This isn't, you know, or you least have a good chance, whatever.

304
00:14:00.16 --> 00:14:01.16
That's what you think.

305
00:14:01.16 --> 00:14:02.16
So yeah, I'm thinking that.

306
00:14:02.16 --> 00:14:06.16
So I meet Mo and good dude, you know,

307
00:14:06.16 --> 00:14:08.16
or going over some moves and then it's like time to train.

308
00:14:08.16 --> 00:14:10.16
And Dean's like, okay, yeah, you train with him,

309
00:14:10.16 --> 00:14:12.16
chocolate and I go, okay, cool.

310
00:14:12.16 --> 00:14:14.16
So, you know, we slap hands and we're doing the,

311
00:14:14.16 --> 00:14:16.16
and Mo is getting ready for fight,

312
00:14:16.16 --> 00:14:17.16
but we weren't fighting at all.

313
00:14:17.16 --> 00:14:19.16
We were just, and it just the kind of putting context.

314
00:14:19.16 --> 00:14:21.16
I mean, you say Mo's a good wrestler.

315
00:14:21.16 --> 00:14:26.16
Mo also happens to be the bellator to a fight channel.

316
00:14:26.16 --> 00:14:29.16
Or it wasn't the champ, or the, he wasn't at this time.

317
00:14:29.16 --> 00:14:32.16
This was like as he was getting into MMA.

318
00:14:32.16 --> 00:14:33.16
Okay.

319
00:14:33.16 --> 00:14:36.16
Yeah. So he was really actually probably sharper wrestling at this time,

320
00:14:36.16 --> 00:14:38.16
because he was coming out of, you know,

321
00:14:38.16 --> 00:14:39.16
trying to be on the Olympics.

322
00:14:39.16 --> 00:14:40.16
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:14:40.16 --> 00:14:45.16
And yeah, he wrestled, I want to say he wrestled at Oklahoma.

324
00:14:45.16 --> 00:14:49.16
But anyways, King Mo is, is what he's known as,

325
00:14:49.16 --> 00:14:50.16
King Mo.

326
00:14:50.16 --> 00:14:54.16
And so anyway, so we slap hands, we're getting ready,

327
00:14:54.16 --> 00:14:56.16
you know, we kind of square off and I'm, you know,

328
00:14:56.16 --> 00:14:58.16
okay, do my thing.

329
00:14:58.16 --> 00:14:59.16
Boom.

330
00:14:59.16 --> 00:15:01.16
He does this take down to me.

331
00:15:01.16 --> 00:15:06.16
His face hits me in the chest.

332
00:15:06.16 --> 00:15:09.16
And this is in the less than the blink of an eye.

333
00:15:09.16 --> 00:15:11.16
His face hits me in the chest.

334
00:15:11.16 --> 00:15:14.16
And his hands, they don't even grab my legs.

335
00:15:14.16 --> 00:15:16.16
They just tap my legs like a double leg.

336
00:15:16.16 --> 00:15:17.16
Blast double.

337
00:15:17.16 --> 00:15:18.16
And it's a blast double.

338
00:15:18.16 --> 00:15:19.16
And I'm in the air.

339
00:15:19.16 --> 00:15:23.16
I mean, he knocked me into the air with his face.

340
00:15:23.16 --> 00:15:25.16
Well, let's say it a lot, because you're huge.

341
00:15:25.16 --> 00:15:27.16
Yeah, he knocked me into the air with his face.

342
00:15:27.16 --> 00:15:30.16
I, I, I, I fall down to the ground.

343
00:15:30.16 --> 00:15:35.16
And the funny thing was it was, I got back up immediately.

344
00:15:35.16 --> 00:15:37.16
Like he didn't even, he took me down so fast.

345
00:15:37.16 --> 00:15:40.16
He couldn't even chase me to the ground, because I was already,

346
00:15:40.16 --> 00:15:41.16
I was back up really quickly.

347
00:15:41.16 --> 00:15:45.16
But that was the fastest take down that,

348
00:15:45.16 --> 00:15:46.16
you know, that I'd felt.

349
00:15:46.16 --> 00:15:48.16
That is probably the fastest take down.

350
00:15:48.16 --> 00:15:49.16
Now we have one more guy.

351
00:15:49.16 --> 00:15:52.16
There's a guy coming up right now at the gym.

352
00:15:52.16 --> 00:15:55.16
Another sick wrestler.

353
00:15:55.16 --> 00:15:58.16
But you know, he wrestled.

354
00:15:58.16 --> 00:15:59.16
He's a really good wrestler.

355
00:15:59.16 --> 00:16:02.16
A sick wrestler, collegiate wrestler and all that.

356
00:16:02.16 --> 00:16:04.16
Taylor Taylor, Taylor Johnson.

357
00:16:04.16 --> 00:16:09.16
So Taylor is another guy who has mutant strike.

358
00:16:09.16 --> 00:16:12.16
He has mutant strike.

359
00:16:12.16 --> 00:16:14.16
Un, normal.

360
00:16:14.16 --> 00:16:15.16
It's not normal.

361
00:16:15.16 --> 00:16:19.16
You know, I was on Taylor.

362
00:16:19.16 --> 00:16:24.16
And I was going for like a guillotine, or I think I was actually going for a crucifix.

363
00:16:24.16 --> 00:16:27.16
So I was, but so for those of you that don't know what this is,

364
00:16:27.16 --> 00:16:31.16
Taylor, picture, picture guy on all fours on the ground.

365
00:16:31.16 --> 00:16:34.16
And someone else is trying to rip their head off.

366
00:16:34.16 --> 00:16:34.16
Okay.

367
00:16:34.16 --> 00:16:35.16
So that's Taylor.

368
00:16:35.16 --> 00:16:37.16
He's on all fours on the ground.

369
00:16:37.16 --> 00:16:39.16
And I'm trying to get him.

370
00:16:39.16 --> 00:16:40.16
Ripp is head off.

371
00:16:40.16 --> 00:16:42.16
With one hand.

372
00:16:42.16 --> 00:16:48.16
He, he goes up to his knees and lifts me into the air.

373
00:16:48.16 --> 00:16:53.16
And shot puts me through the air onto the ground.

374
00:16:53.16 --> 00:16:57.16
And is, and then gets across side.

375
00:16:57.16 --> 00:16:58.16
And I started laughing.

376
00:16:58.16 --> 00:17:01.16
I'm like, bro, you just shot put me.

377
00:17:01.16 --> 00:17:03.16
And he didn't even do it from his hips.

378
00:17:03.16 --> 00:17:05.16
Like he didn't get the, the strength from his hips.

379
00:17:05.16 --> 00:17:09.16
He got it from his upper torso.

380
00:17:09.16 --> 00:17:10.16
He didn't use his legs at all.

381
00:17:10.16 --> 00:17:13.16
No legs because he was on his knees.

382
00:17:13.16 --> 00:17:17.16
And so he just has this massive explosiveness.

383
00:17:17.16 --> 00:17:20.16
But then in the thing that's really scary about Taylor,

384
00:17:20.16 --> 00:17:23.16
it is that he's adapting.

385
00:17:23.16 --> 00:17:27.76
Because because just because you're a good wrestler doesn't mean you automatically adapt well to

386
00:17:27.76 --> 00:17:28.76
GJ2.

387
00:17:28.76 --> 00:17:32.16
Some people never adapt really well to GJ2.

388
00:17:32.16 --> 00:17:36.96
And you can see, I mean, in MMA in the UFC, there's plenty of wrestlers that you look at

389
00:17:36.96 --> 00:17:42.16
and you go, yeah, that guy never really transitioned into become a comprehensive ground fighter.

390
00:17:42.16 --> 00:17:47.16
That was as comfortable on his back as he is on cross side as he is going for submissions.

391
00:17:47.16 --> 00:17:50.16
There's some guys that would been extremely successful that never made that transition.

392
00:17:50.16 --> 00:17:55.16
But they stay on top ground and pound Taylor, if you watch him roll,

393
00:17:55.16 --> 00:17:59.16
you might not even know he was a wrestler until you roll with him.

394
00:17:59.16 --> 00:18:01.16
And then you're going to feel that you can't move him.

395
00:18:01.16 --> 00:18:04.16
But if you just watch him roll, you're like, oh, wow, he's going for, you know,

396
00:18:04.16 --> 00:18:09.16
advanced you did to move by the way, been training for less than a year.

397
00:18:09.16 --> 00:18:13.16
Yeah, very surprising with him in regards to that.

398
00:18:13.16 --> 00:18:14.16
Like, you look at him.

399
00:18:14.16 --> 00:18:17.16
If you look at him, you're like, okay, I'm about to roll with this guy.

400
00:18:17.16 --> 00:18:20.16
And then you roll with him, you're going to be like, okay, I'm not surprised at this guy's,

401
00:18:20.16 --> 00:18:26.16
like, this guy's strong, his balance is just like, like, magical balance kind of thing.

402
00:18:26.16 --> 00:18:30.16
So when you look at him in on the on the on the surface, but if you know that he's such a

403
00:18:30.16 --> 00:18:35.16
accomplished wrestler, you would think given his experience, you think, okay, his, his

404
00:18:35.16 --> 00:18:40.16
Jiu Jitsu or even his like, when he's training his Jiu Jitsu, you know,

405
00:18:40.16 --> 00:18:42.16
you wouldn't expect it to be that fluid.

406
00:18:42.16 --> 00:18:45.16
Like when I rolled with him, I was like, I thought when you were like, yeah,

407
00:18:45.16 --> 00:18:48.16
Taylor's, he's kind of the new guy, you know, you, you, you haven't rolled with him.

408
00:18:48.16 --> 00:18:51.16
What he should roll with him because, you know, he, he gets good training.

409
00:18:51.16 --> 00:18:52.16
Yeah.

410
00:18:52.16 --> 00:18:52.16
Really good.

411
00:18:52.16 --> 00:18:57.16
So what I'm thinking is good, but I'm thinking this is going to be real wrestling intensive.

412
00:18:57.16 --> 00:18:58.16
Yeah.

413
00:18:58.16 --> 00:18:59.16
Training scenario.

414
00:18:59.16 --> 00:19:00.16
Then he told the guy on you.

415
00:19:00.16 --> 00:19:03.16
No, he didn't pull guard, but his whole thing, again,

416
00:19:03.16 --> 00:19:05.16
Yeah, he was in the hard, he doesn't care.

417
00:19:05.16 --> 00:19:06.16
Yeah, he was like, I'm here to train.

418
00:19:06.16 --> 00:19:08.16
I mean, you're, you know, get good or whatever man.

419
00:19:08.16 --> 00:19:10.16
And he's, and that kind of attitude.

420
00:19:10.16 --> 00:19:11.16
Yep.

421
00:19:11.16 --> 00:19:12.16
He gets you so good.

422
00:19:12.16 --> 00:19:15.16
And he's, yeah, man, it wasn't, he wasn't trying to like, okay, another big guy.

423
00:19:15.16 --> 00:19:17.16
Let me like wrestle this guy.

424
00:19:17.16 --> 00:19:21.16
He was, we were doing straight up Jitsu and he was, he was, it was clean.

425
00:19:21.16 --> 00:19:22.16
It was good.

426
00:19:22.16 --> 00:19:22.16
Yeah.

427
00:19:22.16 --> 00:19:25.16
But anyways, he's got that super explosiveness too.

428
00:19:25.16 --> 00:19:27.16
That's, that's new in level.

429
00:19:27.16 --> 00:19:28.16
And also is striking.

430
00:19:28.16 --> 00:19:29.16
Yeah.

431
00:19:29.16 --> 00:19:30.16
Is ridiculous.

432
00:19:30.16 --> 00:19:33.16
And he hasn't been, he's just a natural athlete because he's been just,

433
00:19:33.16 --> 00:19:34.16
Yeah.

434
00:19:34.16 --> 00:19:35.16
Anyways, so that's him.

435
00:19:35.16 --> 00:19:36.16
And we got a bunch of other firefighters too.

436
00:19:36.16 --> 00:19:39.16
I mean, you got Big Andy, who's awesome.

437
00:19:39.16 --> 00:19:42.16
Just, just, just, just, just showed up.

438
00:19:42.16 --> 00:19:45.16
So we got some, got some good training in there.

439
00:19:45.16 --> 00:19:46.16
Yeah.

440
00:19:46.16 --> 00:19:48.16
But back to this deal.

441
00:19:48.16 --> 00:19:53.16
So I was talking to Taylor about Hago Brody.

442
00:19:53.16 --> 00:19:55.16
Do you ever like, Olympic lift?

443
00:19:55.16 --> 00:19:58.16
And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got an acrossfit for like a month.

444
00:19:58.16 --> 00:20:03.16
And, and that was right before I got an MMA and I was doing pretty good.

445
00:20:03.16 --> 00:20:04.16
And I was like, what does that mean?

446
00:20:04.16 --> 00:20:07.16
He's like, oh, I was, I could snatch him like 300.

447
00:20:07.16 --> 00:20:09.16
I was like, what?

448
00:20:09.16 --> 00:20:11.16
And then, I'd made it across fit games.

449
00:20:11.16 --> 00:20:13.16
He did cross fit for a month.

450
00:20:13.16 --> 00:20:15.16
And never snatch before an off-sony snatch.

451
00:20:15.16 --> 00:20:17.16
Almost 300 pounds.

452
00:20:17.16 --> 00:20:18.16
That's insane.

453
00:20:18.16 --> 00:20:19.16
Yeah.

454
00:20:19.16 --> 00:20:25.16
So, but that, and that's what it feels like when you roll with somebody that has that kind of explosive strength,

455
00:20:25.16 --> 00:20:29.16
it's very, very, it's, it's a very good tool to have.

456
00:20:29.16 --> 00:20:34.16
Now there's, we could go through the entire list of body types, strengths and weaknesses.

457
00:20:34.16 --> 00:20:39.16
Because, you know, you get, you get the lanky people that are strong and why are you like a Higgs.

458
00:20:39.16 --> 00:20:40.16
You rolled with Higgs before, right?

459
00:20:40.16 --> 00:20:41.16
No.

460
00:20:41.16 --> 00:20:42.16
Yeah.

461
00:20:42.16 --> 00:20:46.16
Higgs is lanky, wiery skinny when he puts the triangle on you.

462
00:20:46.16 --> 00:20:50.16
It starts to cut into your body because he's all, you know,

463
00:20:50.16 --> 00:20:52.16
uh, compritos like that comprio's us again.

464
00:20:52.16 --> 00:20:56.16
Like, like, how can you sweep him when his arm is, is basing like four,

465
00:20:56.16 --> 00:20:59.16
like eight feet over there is where he's basing.

466
00:20:59.16 --> 00:21:03.16
So you get that kind of body then you get the real, like the stocky.

467
00:21:03.16 --> 00:21:07.16
Uh, people with no limbs sticking out, you know?

468
00:21:07.16 --> 00:21:09.16
Yeah, you can't it's hard to choke them.

469
00:21:09.16 --> 00:21:12.16
So anyways, we go through everybody style, but any,

470
00:21:12.16 --> 00:21:16.16
any, one of them has an advantage, but the thing that's cool about

471
00:21:16.16 --> 00:21:19.16
explosiveness is something you can somewhat train, right?

472
00:21:19.16 --> 00:21:20.16
You can somewhat train now.

473
00:21:20.16 --> 00:21:24.16
You can't, you're not going to be able to naturally get as explosive as

474
00:21:24.16 --> 00:21:29.16
mole a wall or as Taylor Johnson, but you can get strong,

475
00:21:29.16 --> 00:21:34.16
right? You can get stronger or so, but, but the other thing is,

476
00:21:34.16 --> 00:21:39.16
where can you defeat them? Where can you, where can you be better than them?

477
00:21:39.16 --> 00:21:41.16
Maybe you can be more flexible than them.

478
00:21:41.16 --> 00:21:43.16
Maybe you can be faster on a scramble.

479
00:21:43.16 --> 00:21:46.16
Maybe you can be heavier and tighter.

480
00:21:46.16 --> 00:21:49.16
So there's some athletic things that you could try and do trying to prove

481
00:21:49.16 --> 00:21:52.16
to overcome and negate some of their advantages.

482
00:21:52.16 --> 00:21:55.16
Hard to do. You get some people that are mutants.

483
00:21:55.16 --> 00:21:56.16
Yeah. Yeah.

484
00:21:56.16 --> 00:21:59.16
The Dean's big and flexible, right? Dean is being strongly

485
00:21:59.16 --> 00:22:01.16
super shockingly flexible.

486
00:22:01.16 --> 00:22:06.16
Glover is so flexible that you know, you have to negate that and

487
00:22:06.16 --> 00:22:10.16
Glover, you know, he loves training with big muscle bound guys.

488
00:22:10.16 --> 00:22:12.16
Yeah. That's like an easy day for him.

489
00:22:12.16 --> 00:22:14.16
That's what he likes to, you know, that's what that's he,

490
00:22:14.16 --> 00:22:18.16
that's the, that's the the easiest matchup body style for him.

491
00:22:18.16 --> 00:22:21.16
That's someone that's just super, super strong and muscle bound.

492
00:22:21.16 --> 00:22:25.16
Yeah. And the, you get mutants like, and I'd say that's kind of

493
00:22:25.16 --> 00:22:29.16
kind of a good way of putting it mutant like Taylor, where he has a

494
00:22:29.16 --> 00:22:33.16
wrestling background. So he's no stranger to like functioning while he's tired.

495
00:22:33.16 --> 00:22:38.16
You know, so I'd say if you're big, explosive, strong or whatever,

496
00:22:38.16 --> 00:22:41.16
typically your endurance is not that good.

497
00:22:41.16 --> 00:22:44.16
Typically. So if you get all those factors and their flexible and

498
00:22:44.16 --> 00:22:48.16
stuff and they have endurance, there's your bad day right there.

499
00:22:48.16 --> 00:22:51.16
If this guy has that other than that, if you take one or two

500
00:22:51.16 --> 00:22:54.16
different attributes, you can always find what's like rock paper

501
00:22:54.16 --> 00:22:58.16
scissors. You can always find one that can, if you just employ this

502
00:22:58.16 --> 00:23:01.16
strategy, it'll give you more than a advantage. And, and because I always

503
00:23:01.16 --> 00:23:05.16
like the tie this together to leadership. So it's the same thing

504
00:23:05.16 --> 00:23:08.16
with leadership and what? Because people last me all the time.

505
00:23:08.16 --> 00:23:11.16
Our leaders, born or made, you know, can you, can you develop a

506
00:23:11.16 --> 00:23:15.16
leader? Everybody is born with certain leadership characteristics.

507
00:23:15.16 --> 00:23:19.16
It's just like a video game where they rank your strength and your

508
00:23:19.16 --> 00:23:22.16
intelligence and your agility and all this stuff that we just talked about.

509
00:23:22.16 --> 00:23:25.16
You don't have that further leadership capability as well, right?

510
00:23:25.16 --> 00:23:29.16
Are they articulate? You know, because that's some people are

511
00:23:29.16 --> 00:23:33.16
articulate and that as a good advantage to have, can you read people

512
00:23:33.16 --> 00:23:36.16
well? Well, that's another thing that some people are naturally

513
00:23:36.16 --> 00:23:41.16
good at. Can you simplify things? That's a talent that some

514
00:23:41.16 --> 00:23:45.16
people have. Now you could go on this list. But what you find is that

515
00:23:45.16 --> 00:23:50.16
people, some people are gifted and they have really strong

516
00:23:50.16 --> 00:23:55.16
leadership characteristics, leadership traits. And that's great.

517
00:23:55.16 --> 00:23:59.16
And then you get some people that don't have those. And so what do you

518
00:23:59.16 --> 00:24:02.16
got to do to the same thing that I have to do in my digital game?

519
00:24:02.16 --> 00:24:05.16
How do you develop those things? How do you become more articulate?

520
00:24:05.16 --> 00:24:09.16
How do you simplify things? How do you recognize that you are a person

521
00:24:09.16 --> 00:24:14.16
that makes things more complex? And how do you focus on making things

522
00:24:14.16 --> 00:24:18.16
simplified? So you just go right down the list. So yes, you can be more

523
00:24:18.16 --> 00:24:22.16
in some natural leadership characteristics. But if you're not born with

524
00:24:22.16 --> 00:24:26.16
them, how do you develop them? It's usually these things are

525
00:24:26.16 --> 00:24:32.16
that hard to develop either. You know? So when you have weaknesses,

526
00:24:32.16 --> 00:24:37.16
identify them, be humble enough to identify them. And then see how

527
00:24:37.16 --> 00:24:42.16
you can improve upon them. And although they may never become your

528
00:24:42.16 --> 00:24:47.16
staple of your game, either as a leader or a digital player

529
00:24:47.16 --> 00:24:51.16
or a digital player, you can be a person that's not something you have to

530
00:24:51.16 --> 00:24:55.16
protect. That's something you have to worry about. Yeah, you can kind of

531
00:24:55.16 --> 00:24:59.16
function in those little regards now. Yes, you can become functional.

532
00:24:59.16 --> 00:25:04.16
And for instance, if you're not the most articulate person, well,

533
00:25:04.16 --> 00:25:10.16
number one, you can study, you can listen to people speak, you can

534
00:25:10.16 --> 00:25:13.16
record yourself speaking, you can video yourself. So you can be

535
00:25:13.16 --> 00:25:16.16
practiced and become more more articulate. And you can, that means,

536
00:25:16.16 --> 00:25:19.16
you're not very particular. So guess what I'm going to do? I'm going to

537
00:25:19.16 --> 00:25:22.16
plan more before I go and brief people. I'm going to go through exactly what

538
00:25:22.16 --> 00:25:25.16
I'm going to say, I might even rehearse it two times. Then I'm going

539
00:25:25.16 --> 00:25:28.16
to sound articulate. So you're going to make up for those, those

540
00:25:28.16 --> 00:25:31.16
problems. And that's all you have to do is figure out how you can

541
00:25:31.16 --> 00:25:35.16
make up or how you can get rid of or how you can mitigate some of

542
00:25:35.16 --> 00:25:38.16
those weaknesses that you have. The other thing you could do is you

543
00:25:38.16 --> 00:25:41.16
surround yourself with somebody that's super articulate. Echo, you're

544
00:25:41.16 --> 00:25:43.16
more articulate than me. Cool. I want you to put out the word of the

545
00:25:43.16 --> 00:25:49.16
word of the word of the word. Boom. Done. Even though I might be in

546
00:25:49.16 --> 00:25:52.16
charge, I'll say, all right, hey, Echo is going to brief this

547
00:25:52.16 --> 00:25:55.16
operation or Echo is going to brief this strategy and then boom,

548
00:25:55.16 --> 00:25:59.16
Mr. Articulate Echo gets up there and does it. Maybe not the best

549
00:25:59.16 --> 00:26:04.16
example. But that's what you do. That's how you want to, that's how

550
00:26:04.16 --> 00:26:09.16
you, you fill in the holes in your leadership game. And the, by the way,

551
00:26:09.16 --> 00:26:13.16
you have weaknesses and that they're there. Yeah, totally true. And I

552
00:26:13.16 --> 00:26:17.16
know you, back to the G. J. It's a real quick. I know you're saying

553
00:26:17.16 --> 00:26:22.16
all these things kind of with it with the given that really the

554
00:26:22.16 --> 00:26:25.16
main thing to train is how much you know, that's really kind of

555
00:26:25.16 --> 00:26:28.16
the main thing. Yeah, the number one thing. So that's all

556
00:26:28.16 --> 00:26:31.16
it's like I said, a given because the question is supplemental stuff.

557
00:26:31.16 --> 00:26:35.16
Sure. So yeah. So let's say these all these little

558
00:26:35.16 --> 00:26:38.16
comparisons like, you know, the, to me, aside from no

559
00:26:38.16 --> 00:26:42.16
thing, you did to that's the main strength or whatever, if everyone's

560
00:26:42.16 --> 00:26:46.16
even to me, the taller guy has the advantage that to me, that's

561
00:26:46.16 --> 00:26:49.16
the most effective advantage that I've seen. It's interesting.

562
00:26:49.16 --> 00:26:53.16
Yeah, you think that. Yeah, I don't think I necessarily agree with

563
00:26:53.16 --> 00:26:59.16
you. What a very tall, very lengthy guy will have is a body

564
00:26:59.16 --> 00:27:04.16
type that that you come across the least. So since you are

565
00:27:04.16 --> 00:27:07.16
coming across this body type, the least, you get the less

566
00:27:07.16 --> 00:27:10.16
you have the least training against it. And since you have less

567
00:27:10.16 --> 00:27:14.16
training, you get said you don't react to it. And by the way, they

568
00:27:14.16 --> 00:27:19.16
constantly work on their strange body style because you are

569
00:27:19.16 --> 00:27:25.16
correct in the fact that the lengthy body style is is

570
00:27:25.16 --> 00:27:32.16
gives you more moves more unique moves than any other body style.

571
00:27:32.16 --> 00:27:36.16
So there's unique move. There's more more unique moves that

572
00:27:36.16 --> 00:27:40.16
only are utilized or can be utilized by a tall, lengthy person.

573
00:27:40.16 --> 00:27:45.16
Then there are then any other body style. Right. And also, you can

574
00:27:45.16 --> 00:27:49.16
pretty, I mean, I'm not saying he's seven feet tall. I'm saying like

575
00:27:49.16 --> 00:27:53.16
the six one up to yeah, like, six one doesn't do it. To me,

576
00:27:53.16 --> 00:27:55.16
well, six one can do it if the person's like, yeah,

577
00:27:55.16 --> 00:27:59.16
beginning of it. But how does like we have stills appropriately

578
00:27:59.16 --> 00:28:04.16
named at the gym. And he has he's tall and like, I think he

579
00:28:04.16 --> 00:28:08.16
has five, but he has really developed the lengthy guy style that

580
00:28:08.16 --> 00:28:11.16
people aren't used to. And it's a challenge for anybody. Yeah. So

581
00:28:11.16 --> 00:28:15.16
stills a good example where in this case, where he's a little bit

582
00:28:15.16 --> 00:28:19.16
different because stills has the lengthy body style, but he

583
00:28:19.16 --> 00:28:23.16
went pretty, he's going pretty hard in that direction where he's

584
00:28:23.16 --> 00:28:27.16
actually moves that only he can be kind of smooth. So that's

585
00:28:27.16 --> 00:28:29.16
exactly the point I'm making. Right. Right. So my way

586
00:28:29.16 --> 00:28:34.16
of as most normal body styles, everybody that's, you know,

587
00:28:34.16 --> 00:28:40.16
five three to, you know, six. Oh, they all have pretty much the same

588
00:28:40.16 --> 00:28:43.16
moves. Right. Right. You know, yeah. So when I'm talking about

589
00:28:43.16 --> 00:28:46.16
I'm not talking about them, I think there's that, but those are

590
00:28:46.16 --> 00:28:48.16
the kind of the outliers that I think overall. I mean, everyone

591
00:28:48.16 --> 00:28:51.16
plays their strengths in one another, but course. I'm saying just

592
00:28:51.16 --> 00:28:54.16
all things mean equal. So like let's say all three

593
00:28:54.16 --> 00:28:57.16
Gracie brothers, Hodgour Gracie, then these guys who are

594
00:28:57.16 --> 00:29:00.16
like six, six, six, four, six, you know, five type

595
00:29:00.16 --> 00:29:05.16
guys will take Hodgour for example. He doesn't really do any kind of crazy

596
00:29:05.16 --> 00:29:08.16
I am tall. So I can only do this. True. You know, he doesn't do that. He

597
00:29:08.16 --> 00:29:12.16
does like, you know, but his like just mount for example. For his

598
00:29:12.16 --> 00:29:16.16
arm bar set up from the bottom or track from the bottom stuff

599
00:29:16.16 --> 00:29:20.16
is just way harder to deal with because he developed such a good

600
00:29:20.16 --> 00:29:23.16
base on top of the fact that physically is made for such a good

601
00:29:23.16 --> 00:29:26.16
base, you know, and he and okay. And here's the thing about

602
00:29:26.16 --> 00:29:29.16
tall guys in general. They're not limited to the moves they can do.

603
00:29:29.16 --> 00:29:32.16
They can do more or less. Yes. All the moves. So like the guys who's

604
00:29:32.16 --> 00:29:36.16
five, three, two, 50 or I'm not fighting. We'll say five, three,

605
00:29:36.16 --> 00:29:40.16
two, 20. Where are you going to just say five, eight? Sure.

606
00:29:40.16 --> 00:29:42.16
Two, two, thirty, whatever. We'll just say that's a stocky

607
00:29:42.16 --> 00:29:45.16
rough guy. He's going to have hard time doing triangle.

608
00:29:45.16 --> 00:29:48.16
Churps on guys. He's on size and his weight division. He

609
00:29:48.16 --> 00:29:51.16
probably turns out. Yeah. That's a triangle. That's a triangle.

610
00:29:51.16 --> 00:29:55.16
It's a major part of the game. Move. Yes. You can't do it. Yeah.

611
00:29:55.16 --> 00:29:58.16
Tall guys don't have that problem. They can do all the moves. They can do

612
00:29:58.16 --> 00:30:01.16
trills, arm bars, whatever. And they're pretty easy. You know, so

613
00:30:01.16 --> 00:30:05.16
like I said, that's why I think, and I, and of course, the

614
00:30:05.16 --> 00:30:09.16
flexible tall, lanky guys, they do have that. But I think we all

615
00:30:09.16 --> 00:30:13.16
do. I think all do what. I have like our body style. Yeah. Give us

616
00:30:13.16 --> 00:30:16.16
special moves only we can do. Yeah. Even if you're sure

617
00:30:16.16 --> 00:30:19.16
in stock. The list of moves, the best list of special moves that I

618
00:30:19.16 --> 00:30:23.16
can do with my body style is like two. Yeah. And the list

619
00:30:23.16 --> 00:30:27.16
that stills can do with his body style is infinite. Still

620
00:30:27.16 --> 00:30:30.16
says two things though he has tall and lanky and he has flexible.

621
00:30:30.16 --> 00:30:33.16
And flexible. Okay. And so yeah. So that's like he has double

622
00:30:33.16 --> 00:30:36.16
the, but I think the tall has the most in their bucket. I think

623
00:30:36.16 --> 00:30:40.16
they definitely have the most options of moves that other

624
00:30:40.16 --> 00:30:44.16
humans can do. But again, the main thing is to know the main

625
00:30:44.16 --> 00:30:47.16
thing is to know the main thing is to know the nature. For sure.

626
00:30:47.16 --> 00:30:50.16
Yeah. For sure. That is the, that is the amazing thing.

627
00:30:50.16 --> 00:30:54.16
And then the other part of this question is what was the hardest

628
00:30:54.16 --> 00:31:01.16
stage of your jujitsu journey? Me, I would say the whole thing

629
00:31:01.16 --> 00:31:05.16
just in completely different ways. Like the, the first

630
00:31:05.16 --> 00:31:10.16
part is like dang you get tired away too quick. And guys who,

631
00:31:10.16 --> 00:31:14.16
you know, are way smaller than you way, you know, whatever

632
00:31:14.16 --> 00:31:17.16
then you are beating you up, you know, and that kind of thing.

633
00:31:17.16 --> 00:31:23.16
Beating you up with no factor whatsoever. Yeah. And they're like

634
00:31:23.16 --> 00:31:26.16
teaching you hey, this is what you did wrong. And you're sitting there

635
00:31:26.16 --> 00:31:29.16
all, but in my case, I was like, 225 when I started. And I'm like

636
00:31:29.16 --> 00:31:32.16
sitting there in this little guy. I don't know if you remember

637
00:31:32.16 --> 00:31:35.16
George, but he, he's a little purple belt that was I was

638
00:31:35.16 --> 00:31:38.16
rolling with a lot. He taught me butterfly guard. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

639
00:31:38.16 --> 00:31:41.16
He's teaching me stoms to the scene with my big muscles. And he's

640
00:31:41.16 --> 00:31:45.16
like teaching me stuff. So that can be hard, I guess. And

641
00:31:45.16 --> 00:31:49.16
I'm getting tired, but I think. And then yeah, you go up blue belt.

642
00:31:49.16 --> 00:31:52.16
In my particular experience, blue belt was pretty, the easiest, I

643
00:31:52.16 --> 00:31:56.16
think, because nothing really was expected of me. And blue belt

644
00:31:56.16 --> 00:31:59.16
is a good place. At the same time, in a way, some people

645
00:31:59.16 --> 00:32:04.16
it's the most frustrating. Yeah. But if you're, like, blue belt,

646
00:32:04.16 --> 00:32:07.16
you're, you're, you're, you're a blue belt. So people know that

647
00:32:07.16 --> 00:32:10.16
you know, you did to a little bit, but you're not expected to

648
00:32:10.16 --> 00:32:13.16
tap anybody. No, yeah. And if you get tapped out by another blue

649
00:32:13.16 --> 00:32:16.16
belt or a purple belt or a brown belt or a black belt, it's no big deal.

650
00:32:16.16 --> 00:32:19.16
Yeah, you're blue. And even a white belt taps you and you're like,

651
00:32:19.16 --> 00:32:22.16
yeah, you know, that shouldn't happen, but yeah, so much to learn. Yeah.

652
00:32:22.16 --> 00:32:25.16
Yeah, totally. And, and, and, yeah, that, you know, how, you know,

653
00:32:25.16 --> 00:32:28.16
when you learn something from the point of not knowing anything

654
00:32:28.16 --> 00:32:31.16
and then you start to learn, you learn the most quantity

655
00:32:31.16 --> 00:32:34.16
wise at the bottom when you start. For sure. You know, so, and

656
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:38.16
that's a philosophical way of putting, it's a specific way of putting

657
00:32:38.16 --> 00:32:45.16
it. So I think there's some stages in the mid levels where your, where your mind starts to fill up and you start to be able to

658
00:32:45.16 --> 00:32:52.16
really absorb stuff to big giant things. Right. But in, as far as

659
00:32:52.16 --> 00:32:56.16
you did, it's totally true. And that's what I mean by like, that's a, that's a way of putting it maybe

660
00:32:56.16 --> 00:33:01.16
philosophically, maybe, but it's because when you're, I mean, quantity wise, meaning

661
00:33:01.16 --> 00:33:07.16
learning the moves, you know, at, like, black belt unless there's these weird special

662
00:33:07.16 --> 00:33:10.16
moves that are coming out or wherever, you know all the moves. You know all this stuff.

663
00:33:10.16 --> 00:33:17.16
It's now it's about other stuff. You got to learn other stuff timing, you know, approaches and all this more like interstitial stuff.

664
00:33:17.16 --> 00:33:20.16
But from a blue belt, you still, like, there's moves. You just don't know.

665
00:33:20.16 --> 00:33:25.16
For sure. So you learn a way quicker if you're interested, you know, so you're like, oh,

666
00:33:25.16 --> 00:33:30.16
I have no answer to this guard pass. I have no answer. I'm a blue belt literally no answer to this guard pass.

667
00:33:30.16 --> 00:33:34.16
So I mean, can show you, oh, this, how you do it, you just, just block the

668
00:33:34.16 --> 00:33:38.16
thing, and you're, oh, automatically not so you just learn more in my experience.

669
00:33:38.16 --> 00:33:43.16
So I didn't think blue belt was very frustrating at all, and I didn't spend much time with blue belt.

670
00:33:43.16 --> 00:33:47.16
And then when you hit purple belt, that's when the learning frustration hits.

671
00:33:47.16 --> 00:33:51.16
Because you're good enough, and you kind of have this weird confidence that's developed.

672
00:33:51.16 --> 00:33:56.16
And then you're, you're doing so well against all these guys, and they just, you just hit that one level up where you can do nothing.

673
00:33:56.16 --> 00:33:59.16
It's nobody and you're just there for a long time.

674
00:33:59.16 --> 00:34:03.16
Because it's almost like you got to switch over to learning different types of things now.

675
00:34:03.16 --> 00:34:08.16
Yeah, you got to open your brain up, open your mind, open your game up, and you got to be vulnerable.

676
00:34:08.16 --> 00:34:12.16
You're not going to learn without making yourself vulnerable from time to time.

677
00:34:12.16 --> 00:34:16.16
Yeah. And again, there's a good parallel hair worth learning about leadership.

678
00:34:16.16 --> 00:34:20.16
I think it's the same thing. You know, you come into a leadership position for the first time.

679
00:34:20.16 --> 00:34:24.16
And it doesn't take long before you're like, okay, I kind of got this, and that's like your blue belt phase where you,

680
00:34:24.16 --> 00:34:32.16
you start feeling like, and then the more people you get to command or the senior leadership position,

681
00:34:32.16 --> 00:34:35.16
you get put into where the harder situation, you get put into.

682
00:34:35.16 --> 00:34:40.16
You realize that all you got to continue to exercise your mind, you got to continue to grow.

683
00:34:40.16 --> 00:34:47.16
You got to continue to try and absorb new information and try new strategies and tactics and still stick with the fundamentals.

684
00:34:47.16 --> 00:34:55.16
Because that's that's one thing that, you know, the fundamentals of GJ2, they're fundamentally the same from white belt to black belt.

685
00:34:55.16 --> 00:35:00.16
And yet they're, they change and there's a times where you break those rules and they're new ones.

686
00:35:00.16 --> 00:35:09.16
And it's the same thing with being a leadership position. The fundamentals don't change, but then how are those, how are those fundamental principles?

687
00:35:09.16 --> 00:35:13.16
New wants to handle these different situations.

688
00:35:13.16 --> 00:35:15.16
Yeah, that's very challenging.

689
00:35:15.16 --> 00:35:24.16
Yeah. And then, yes, true. And Brown belt to me is more the same as purple belt, but just more refined, you know.

690
00:35:24.16 --> 00:35:30.16
So it's less of the frustration, but the frustration becomes more concentrated.

691
00:35:30.16 --> 00:35:39.16
You know what's crazy for me? And I don't know if this is just, you know, when you remember back in the past, like you forget the bad stuff of the past.

692
00:35:39.16 --> 00:35:40.16
Sure.

693
00:35:40.16 --> 00:35:42.16
Do you know what I mean? Does everyone do that?

694
00:35:42.16 --> 00:35:44.16
Depends a little bit.

695
00:35:44.16 --> 00:35:45.16
Yeah, yeah.

696
00:35:45.16 --> 00:35:48.16
I mean, you know, we were in high school, everything was great.

697
00:35:48.16 --> 00:35:48.16
Right?

698
00:35:48.16 --> 00:35:58.16
So hey, when we went to college, everything was great or, you know, in the sealed teams, you go, oh, yeah, that deployment was great. We forget about all the hard stuff on a deployment or anyone that was bad or whatever didn't work out the way wanted to.

699
00:35:58.16 --> 00:36:06.16
I don't know if it's that, but when I talk about the hardest stage of my jitzu jury journey, it's one big blur of fun.

700
00:36:06.16 --> 00:36:15.16
There's nothing where I think, wow, I was frustrated this time. No, man, I never had that feeling. I go home from the gym every time kind of like, good day training, but that was fun.

701
00:36:15.16 --> 00:36:24.16
That was cool that I learned this or man, I can't believe like a cop by that guy. He's getting good or whatever, you know, just kind of, I don't have like these these hard stages to me.

702
00:36:24.16 --> 00:36:25.16
Yeah.

703
00:36:25.16 --> 00:36:28.16
Maybe I'm just a person that really enjoys it a lot, I guess.

704
00:36:28.16 --> 00:36:32.16
Yeah, and I would say that that's most people.

705
00:36:32.16 --> 00:36:33.16
I think so too.

706
00:36:33.16 --> 00:36:36.16
I think I'm the same boat and, you know, for you, the term frustrations.

707
00:36:36.16 --> 00:36:37.16
Yeah, big, a wall.

708
00:36:37.16 --> 00:36:44.16
And I'm actually, you know, I don't, I don't want to bring this out in the public audience, but I actually have seen you get frustrated from time to time.

709
00:36:44.16 --> 00:36:47.16
Well, those are like, my fruity way of getting frustrated.

710
00:36:47.16 --> 00:36:49.16
Whatever, then I see the same thing with you.

711
00:36:49.16 --> 00:36:58.16
When, oh, you're a miss, okay, one time you're rolling with Dean and Dean had you, you know how like Dean will get ahead of you psychologically.

712
00:36:58.16 --> 00:37:01.16
And he'll be like, oh, yeah, and he'll like be baiting you and laughing and stuff.

713
00:37:01.16 --> 00:37:03.16
And then the more he laughs, the less you laugh.

714
00:37:03.16 --> 00:37:10.16
So you're getting really mad. And I remember he was doing this thing where you guys stood up and you were like, you were just tired of what's going on.

715
00:37:10.16 --> 00:37:15.16
You're tired of it and you're turning up the heat and Dean was just like, okay, and then he like Lee, okay, this is what he did. He leaned against the wall.

716
00:37:15.16 --> 00:37:21.16
Kind of like, oh, you can't take me to Adam again. So all and you engage or whatever you guys went down and he got you.

717
00:37:21.16 --> 00:37:23.16
I think he got you with Armbar.

718
00:37:23.16 --> 00:37:28.16
And I remember it was Armbar because I remember thinking, I don't think I've ever seen Jockel's egg and tapped out.

719
00:37:28.16 --> 00:37:31.16
Be with the Armbar. I can see like a foot lock, something like Jockel.

720
00:37:31.16 --> 00:37:35.16
But he got you with Armbar and you were like, you were frustrated.

721
00:37:35.16 --> 00:37:41.16
Yeah. On the last, I was like, what we could call a micro frustration overall.

722
00:37:41.16 --> 00:37:52.16
There, these are like little challenges. So that frustration though, is it possible for it to be called frustration if it brings me joy?

723
00:37:52.16 --> 00:38:01.16
Is it possible because even in the depths of like frustration, and I feel good, even getting tapped out.

724
00:38:01.16 --> 00:38:09.16
Yeah, especially when you can reflect on it. And that's why I think you said, or when you said, you forget about the bad things.

725
00:38:09.16 --> 00:38:13.16
You forget about the bad things in a certain kind of discourse.

726
00:38:13.16 --> 00:38:18.16
If you regard that overall discourse as being a good thing, then you'll start to get the bad thing.

727
00:38:18.16 --> 00:38:19.16
Yes. And vice versa.

728
00:38:19.16 --> 00:38:26.16
But I never go home and say, like, oh, man, I can't believe that I couldn't get out of there. I just couldn't get anything.

729
00:38:26.16 --> 00:38:28.16
At least it's, I don't remember.

730
00:38:28.16 --> 00:38:31.16
Yeah. Yeah. I got to have that feeling to there. Something like that.

731
00:38:31.16 --> 00:38:36.16
Yeah. It has to be, and really what they are are just the challenges that are specific to certain stages.

732
00:38:36.16 --> 00:38:43.16
And these are just these are real general things that probably apply to, you know, to everybody in one way or another on the stages.

733
00:38:43.16 --> 00:38:44.16
Yeah.

734
00:38:44.16 --> 00:38:51.16
It's the same thing with leadership like most of the time, even though I've been some situations where I was like, man, I didn't do a good job there.

735
00:38:51.16 --> 00:38:59.16
I could done better. Normally, I'm not frustrated or I was working for somebody that wasn't let me do what I wanted to do.

736
00:38:59.16 --> 00:39:03.16
And I had more maneuvering to do to get where I needed to be.

737
00:39:03.16 --> 00:39:04.16
Yeah.

738
00:39:04.16 --> 00:39:06.16
I didn't get frustrated and enjoy that game.

739
00:39:06.16 --> 00:39:07.16
Yes, they did.

740
00:39:07.16 --> 00:39:08.16
Yeah.

741
00:39:08.16 --> 00:39:10.16
Micro frustrations.

742
00:39:10.16 --> 00:39:11.16
Yeah.

743
00:39:11.16 --> 00:39:13.16
They're like, micro terrors in your muscle.

744
00:39:13.16 --> 00:39:16.16
You feel them, but they're all for like benefit for overall muscle.

745
00:39:16.16 --> 00:39:17.16
They're not in general.

746
00:39:17.16 --> 00:39:18.16
They're not in general.

747
00:39:18.16 --> 00:39:19.16
Exactly.

748
00:39:19.16 --> 00:39:20.16
Awesome.

749
00:39:20.16 --> 00:39:21.16
Awesome.

750
00:39:21.16 --> 00:39:22.16
That's question.

751
00:39:22.16 --> 00:39:23.16
Thanks, Kesch.

752
00:39:23.16 --> 00:39:24.16
Jockel.

753
00:39:24.16 --> 00:39:34.16
You've talked about how getting into adversarial relationships is pointless, but people always get into adversarial relationships with me.

754
00:39:34.16 --> 00:39:38.16
I've been told I'm scary before, but never understood why.

755
00:39:38.16 --> 00:39:44.16
My question is, how do I maneuver on this without acting like a little weakling?

756
00:39:44.16 --> 00:39:47.16
Bitch, I'll act with my character.

757
00:39:47.16 --> 00:39:50.16
To appear less threatening.

758
00:39:50.16 --> 00:39:52.16
Do I just accept that?

759
00:39:52.16 --> 00:39:55.16
I rub people the wrong way.

760
00:39:55.16 --> 00:39:58.16
So this is a question.

761
00:39:58.16 --> 00:40:06.16
I'll do my best to answer because it's time for definitely time for some self-awareness here for the individual asking this question.

762
00:40:06.16 --> 00:40:14.16
It sounds like you are, you know, a big, abrasive person that is aggressive and intimidates people.

763
00:40:14.16 --> 00:40:19.16
And I know what's like to be that person because I could come across as intimidating.

764
00:40:19.16 --> 00:40:21.16
I know that.

765
00:40:21.16 --> 00:40:23.16
I can definitely come across as aggressive.

766
00:40:23.16 --> 00:40:24.16
I can be aggressive.

767
00:40:24.16 --> 00:40:26.16
I am aggressive in many ways.

768
00:40:26.16 --> 00:40:27.16
Abrausive.

769
00:40:27.16 --> 00:40:36.16
I don't know that not necessarily categorizes me because I'm very cautious about not being abrasive,

770
00:40:36.16 --> 00:40:41.16
because if I'm being abrasive with people, am I building a relationship under making any progress?

771
00:40:41.16 --> 00:40:42.16
I think that's the answer.

772
00:40:42.16 --> 00:40:52.16
So something, the thing is, when I hear this type of question, I think that there's some little bit of insecurity going on here.

773
00:40:52.16 --> 00:40:53.16
Right?

774
00:40:53.16 --> 00:40:56.16
Some little bit of, hey, that's not an insult.

775
00:40:56.16 --> 00:41:00.16
That's what I sense because everyone's got insecurities.

776
00:41:00.16 --> 00:41:03.16
I do, everybody does.

777
00:41:03.16 --> 00:41:10.16
But the fact that you asked this question, I'm hoping that that means you want to make some kind of improvement.

778
00:41:10.16 --> 00:41:11.16
Right?

779
00:41:11.16 --> 00:41:12.16
You want to get better.

780
00:41:12.16 --> 00:41:20.16
And, you know, I'm a little worried that you might just be looking for like reinforcement because people think,

781
00:41:20.16 --> 00:41:21.16
Joc was big and aggressive.

782
00:41:21.16 --> 00:41:28.16
So if I say I'm big and aggressive, I'm, you know, Joc was just going to say, hey, those people are just scared of you and they don't deserve your mercy.

783
00:41:28.16 --> 00:41:29.16
Or, you know what you do?

784
00:41:29.16 --> 00:41:33.16
You use your intimidation factor overrun those people, right?

785
00:41:33.16 --> 00:41:35.16
That might be what you're looking for.

786
00:41:35.16 --> 00:41:38.16
But you're not going to get that here.

787
00:41:38.16 --> 00:41:40.16
Because that's not going to help you.

788
00:41:40.16 --> 00:41:43.16
It's not going to help you achieve your goals.

789
00:41:43.16 --> 00:41:47.16
And you talk about people being scared of you.

790
00:41:47.16 --> 00:41:53.16
But the fact likely is, is that you're the one that's scared.

791
00:41:53.16 --> 00:42:00.16
And you actually said it yourself and that you don't want to appear to be weak.

792
00:42:00.16 --> 00:42:04.16
You don't want to appear to be a bitch, right?

793
00:42:04.16 --> 00:42:09.16
That is that feeling, that's fear.

794
00:42:09.16 --> 00:42:11.16
That's fear.

795
00:42:11.16 --> 00:42:13.16
It's fear of looking weak.

796
00:42:13.16 --> 00:42:15.16
It's fear of looking wrong.

797
00:42:15.16 --> 00:42:19.16
It's fear of failure and it's fear of vulnerability.

798
00:42:19.16 --> 00:42:23.16
And those are, those are real.

799
00:42:23.16 --> 00:42:25.16
Those are real.

800
00:42:25.16 --> 00:42:29.16
And if you're, you know, everybody should be feeling those fears.

801
00:42:29.16 --> 00:42:32.16
At some level, but you have to overcome those fears.

802
00:42:32.16 --> 00:42:36.16
If you don't, then how are you ever going to step up?

803
00:42:36.16 --> 00:42:41.16
If you're, if you're too afraid to be wrong, how are you ever going to answer a question?

804
00:42:41.16 --> 00:42:47.16
If you're too afraid to, look weak,

805
00:42:47.16 --> 00:42:50.16
however you ever going to expose yourself, any weaknesses.

806
00:42:50.16 --> 00:42:55.16
If you don't expose any weaknesses, well, just build a bunker around yourself and sit in there by yourself.

807
00:42:55.16 --> 00:42:59.16
So as a leader, we know that up and down the chain of command,

808
00:42:59.16 --> 00:43:02.16
you need to develop relationships, right?

809
00:43:02.16 --> 00:43:05.16
That's what that's what you're supposed to do.

810
00:43:05.16 --> 00:43:07.16
That means you need to communicate with people.

811
00:43:07.16 --> 00:43:12.16
That means you need to talk and you need to listen and you need to develop trust.

812
00:43:12.16 --> 00:43:20.16
And one of the best ways to develop trust with other people is by exposing some vulnerability.

813
00:43:20.16 --> 00:43:25.16
By saying, hey, I'm not quite sure how to do this or hey, echo.

814
00:43:25.16 --> 00:43:27.16
Can you help me with this issue?

815
00:43:27.16 --> 00:43:31.16
I am going on here. I don't know how to solve it.

816
00:43:31.16 --> 00:43:38.16
That's ways that you build trust in thereby build relationships.

817
00:43:38.16 --> 00:43:42.16
And it's hard to do that because you don't want to look stupid.

818
00:43:42.16 --> 00:43:45.16
You don't want to look weak. You don't want to admit you don't know something.

819
00:43:45.16 --> 00:43:52.16
Because you want to be Mr. Strong and know everything.

820
00:43:52.16 --> 00:44:00.16
And so you're probably putting up a front on aggressive front and abrasive front.

821
00:44:00.16 --> 00:44:04.16
It's a wall to keep people intimidated.

822
00:44:04.16 --> 00:44:07.16
And then in your mind, you think it's not my fault.

823
00:44:07.16 --> 00:44:10.16
It's their fault because they're scared of me.

824
00:44:10.16 --> 00:44:15.16
It's their fault because I'm so intimidating.

825
00:44:15.16 --> 00:44:18.16
So that is not good.

826
00:44:18.16 --> 00:44:23.16
And then you get the your kind of closing statement. Should you just accept that I run people the wrong way.

827
00:44:23.16 --> 00:44:25.16
You can.

828
00:44:25.16 --> 00:44:27.16
You can accept that you run people the wrong way.

829
00:44:27.16 --> 00:44:32.16
But then you might as well accept right then and there that you're never going to be a true leader.

830
00:44:32.16 --> 00:44:36.16
That's you're never going to build any relationship that you're never going to inspire anybody.

831
00:44:36.16 --> 00:44:43.16
And you're never going to be the leader of a badass unified, high performing team.

832
00:44:43.16 --> 00:44:47.16
Probably not worth it.

833
00:44:47.16 --> 00:44:57.16
And the the better thing to do is to humble yourself.

834
00:44:57.16 --> 00:45:11.16
Is to open yourself up to the pain and the discomfort of displaying weakness and error and failure.

835
00:45:11.16 --> 00:45:20.16
And open yourself up to try and be nice to other people.

836
00:45:20.16 --> 00:45:23.16
Instead of being scared of what's going to happen if you expose yourself.

837
00:45:23.16 --> 00:45:26.16
Go ahead and throw it out there.

838
00:45:26.16 --> 00:45:28.16
Act pleasant to them.

839
00:45:28.16 --> 00:45:33.16
So they talk to you without fear and then doing those things.

840
00:45:33.16 --> 00:45:36.16
You can overcome whatever these on the insecurities are.

841
00:45:36.16 --> 00:45:38.16
And I don't know what the insecurities you have.

842
00:45:38.16 --> 00:45:41.16
You could be any number of things. Maybe you don't think you're smart as they are.

843
00:45:41.16 --> 00:45:43.16
Maybe you don't think you're as well educated as they are.

844
00:45:43.16 --> 00:45:46.16
Maybe you don't think that they have you have the strategic vision that they have.

845
00:45:46.16 --> 00:45:48.16
Whatever those insecurities are. It's all good.

846
00:45:48.16 --> 00:45:49.16
We all got them.

847
00:45:49.16 --> 00:45:51.16
No big deal.

848
00:45:51.16 --> 00:45:56.16
But if you stop hiding them and you own them.

849
00:45:56.16 --> 00:46:04.16
You will become not only a better leader.

850
00:46:04.16 --> 00:46:09.16
But you become a better man.

851
00:46:09.16 --> 00:46:17.16
So take a breath and get home.

852
00:46:17.16 --> 00:46:21.16
And take another crack at this gig.

853
00:46:21.16 --> 00:46:25.16
You know, I think losing your temper is a huge red flag.

854
00:46:25.16 --> 00:46:28.16
Like I've always said and always will say, you'd red flag.

855
00:46:28.16 --> 00:46:30.16
If you're losing your temper and I'm not saying screaming yell.

856
00:46:30.16 --> 00:46:33.16
I'm just saying you're getting mad at displaying that anger.

857
00:46:33.16 --> 00:46:36.16
Well, what's really what's really what's really.

858
00:46:36.16 --> 00:46:43.16
What's really bad is when people utilize their temper as a tool to scare and intimidate people.

859
00:46:43.16 --> 00:46:47.16
It's like, oh man, I don't want to say anything to juggle on this because you're going to lose his temper.

860
00:46:47.16 --> 00:46:49.16
It's mind go crazy.

861
00:46:49.16 --> 00:46:53.16
Like that's that's me using it as a tool.

862
00:46:53.16 --> 00:46:56.16
Which is not good because you're not building any relationships.

863
00:46:56.16 --> 00:46:59.16
You're not going to need input from people.

864
00:46:59.16 --> 00:47:04.16
You're you're not respected by the way. People might fear you if you have a bad temper,

865
00:47:04.16 --> 00:47:08.16
but they don't respect you. They're not calling you up and asking you for advice.

866
00:47:08.16 --> 00:47:12.16
They're not wanting you to run their their project.

867
00:47:12.16 --> 00:47:13.16
Yeah.

868
00:47:13.16 --> 00:47:14.16
No.

869
00:47:14.16 --> 00:47:17.16
And they're not motivated to do good by you when you're not around.

870
00:47:17.16 --> 00:47:21.16
They are definitely not motivated to do good by you and you're not around.

871
00:47:21.16 --> 00:47:24.16
In fact, the only reason they do anything is out of fear.

872
00:47:24.16 --> 00:47:29.16
So whereas if you have a relationship with them, you could leave for six months.

873
00:47:29.16 --> 00:47:33.16
And the people that know you and respect you and care about you and have a relationship,

874
00:47:33.16 --> 00:47:36.16
they're still busting their ass to do the best they can for you.

875
00:47:36.16 --> 00:47:38.16
You glad when you come back to.

876
00:47:38.16 --> 00:47:39.16
Yeah.

877
00:47:39.16 --> 00:47:40.16
Yeah.

878
00:47:40.16 --> 00:47:42.16
And a lot of times like.

879
00:47:42.16 --> 00:47:46.16
So the adversarial relationship thing.

880
00:47:46.16 --> 00:47:52.16
Wait a look at it is it kind of takes both you to kind of cultivate an adversarial relationship.

881
00:47:52.16 --> 00:47:54.16
Go let's go to the right.

882
00:47:54.16 --> 00:47:55.16
Go.

883
00:47:55.16 --> 00:47:55.16
No.

884
00:47:55.16 --> 00:47:56.16
Yes.

885
00:47:56.16 --> 00:47:56.16
No.

886
00:47:56.16 --> 00:47:57.16
It will okay.

887
00:47:57.16 --> 00:47:58.16
So here.

888
00:47:58.16 --> 00:48:01.16
You keep being a dick to me.

889
00:48:01.16 --> 00:48:02.16
Mm-hmm.

890
00:48:02.16 --> 00:48:02.16
We'll say.

891
00:48:02.16 --> 00:48:05.16
And if I just keep being nice to you.

892
00:48:05.16 --> 00:48:07.16
Even though you're being a dick to me.

893
00:48:07.16 --> 00:48:08.16
Even though we have a job to do with it.

894
00:48:08.16 --> 00:48:09.16
Yes.

895
00:48:09.16 --> 00:48:11.16
All that and remain tainted integrity of that.

896
00:48:11.16 --> 00:48:13.16
But I'm keep being nice to you.

897
00:48:13.16 --> 00:48:14.16
You keep being a dick to me.

898
00:48:14.16 --> 00:48:15.16
I keep being nice to you.

899
00:48:15.16 --> 00:48:18.16
After a while the way that shakes itself out is.

900
00:48:18.16 --> 00:48:19.16
I'm being nice.

901
00:48:19.16 --> 00:48:21.16
I just percone the denominator.

902
00:48:21.16 --> 00:48:22.16
No.

903
00:48:22.16 --> 00:48:23.16
No.

904
00:48:23.16 --> 00:48:24.16
Well, here's the thing.

905
00:48:24.16 --> 00:48:25.16
We're still getting the job done whenever.

906
00:48:25.16 --> 00:48:30.16
But my response to you if you be a dick to me is not be a dick back or defend.

907
00:48:30.16 --> 00:48:34.16
You know, it's just being a, oh, you know, it's a way we're going to say it shakes out.

908
00:48:34.16 --> 00:48:40.16
As it shakes out, the one guy who's a dick stands out.

909
00:48:40.16 --> 00:48:46.16
So everyone's being cool and when all is said and done, we're just dealing with one guy who's a dick.

910
00:48:46.16 --> 00:48:50.16
So if you, if you cultivate the adversarial relationship,

911
00:48:50.16 --> 00:48:53.16
it's like, okay, you have this competitive situation.

912
00:48:53.16 --> 00:48:55.16
Now two people, you know, our dick.

913
00:48:55.16 --> 00:48:56.16
So you guys that are jerks.

914
00:48:56.16 --> 00:48:57.16
Yeah.

915
00:48:57.16 --> 00:48:58.16
Yeah.

916
00:48:58.16 --> 00:48:59.16
And let's say you were nice.

917
00:48:59.16 --> 00:49:00.16
Gotta begin with.

918
00:49:00.16 --> 00:49:04.16
Don't become a jerk now, you know.

919
00:49:04.16 --> 00:49:05.16
Mm-hmm.

920
00:49:05.16 --> 00:49:06.16
That's true.

921
00:49:06.16 --> 00:49:10.16
So, and I'm saying that because a lot of times, if you're like, hey, people are creating

922
00:49:10.16 --> 00:49:14.16
Adversary relationships with me.

923
00:49:14.16 --> 00:49:17.16
You're going to play a part in that relationship, you know?

924
00:49:17.16 --> 00:49:18.16
Yeah.

925
00:49:18.16 --> 00:49:25.16
And the thing with this question, and, you know, I mean, even the terminology used, which is, you know,

926
00:49:25.16 --> 00:49:29.16
how do I maneuver on this without acting like a little bitch?

927
00:49:29.16 --> 00:49:30.16
Yeah, literally.

928
00:49:30.16 --> 00:49:34.16
So you got to figure not, not, you know, not the most mature person.

929
00:49:34.16 --> 00:49:40.16
So I'm guessing, hey, man, you're probably 22, you know, 24, something like that, or you're having

930
00:49:40.16 --> 00:49:45.16
matured a lot in your 27, but you're still caught in that game.

931
00:49:45.16 --> 00:49:53.16
And I think a lot of times, you know, people when they meet me or they learn about me, or

932
00:49:53.16 --> 00:49:57.16
I show up at their business, they think I'm going to be that guy.

933
00:49:57.16 --> 00:50:00.16
That's like, we're going to just comb it here.

934
00:50:00.16 --> 00:50:06.16
And it's always really cool when people go, man, yeah, I didn't think of that.

935
00:50:06.16 --> 00:50:10.16
It's all you have this approach that we didn't expect, and I'm like, yeah, you know?

936
00:50:10.16 --> 00:50:16.16
And by now, most people kind of, you know, at this stage in Eshelon front, when I show up somewhere,

937
00:50:16.16 --> 00:50:17.16
people have listened to podcasts.

938
00:50:17.16 --> 00:50:18.16
They know where I'm coming from.

939
00:50:18.16 --> 00:50:19.16
Yeah.

940
00:50:19.16 --> 00:50:25.16
Now, but, you know, two years ago, you know, they expected this big, sergeant slaughter type thing to go down.

941
00:50:25.16 --> 00:50:30.16
With these folks in the show, with these people in the shape, and my guess is that the

942
00:50:30.16 --> 00:50:34.16
individual that asked this question was kind of thinking, he would get some moral support for me.

943
00:50:34.16 --> 00:50:38.16
And I'm trying to give more support, because I want to do this successful, because I want him to go out and

944
00:50:38.16 --> 00:50:40.16
dominate in the world.

945
00:50:40.16 --> 00:50:45.16
But to go out and dominate in the world, you have to be a chess player, not a checker's player.

946
00:50:45.16 --> 00:50:47.16
You've got to think.

947
00:50:47.16 --> 00:50:49.16
You've got to use the relationships.

948
00:50:49.16 --> 00:50:54.16
You've got to use indirect warfare to go out there and be blunt force trauma on everybody.

949
00:50:54.16 --> 00:51:00.16
It'll get you, it'll get you, you know, it'll get you a quarter of the way there.

950
00:51:00.16 --> 00:51:04.16
If you're lucky, and then it won't get you the rest of the way.

951
00:51:04.16 --> 00:51:08.16
So just just in Snowvik deal, man, you're young, you got some learning to do.

952
00:51:08.16 --> 00:51:09.16
That's awesome.

953
00:51:09.16 --> 00:51:12.16
I wish I would have been smart enough to ask this question when I was a young student,

954
00:51:12.16 --> 00:51:13.16
23 years old.

955
00:51:13.16 --> 00:51:17.16
You've got some, you're thinking you recognize that you're in a situation.

956
00:51:17.16 --> 00:51:22.16
So all you got to do is just just start taking a different approach, a little bit more of an indirect approach,

957
00:51:22.16 --> 00:51:26.16
a little bit more of an open mind, a little bit more humility, don't worry about looking weak.

958
00:51:26.16 --> 00:51:32.16
When you, the people that are scared to look weak are the people that are weak.

959
00:51:32.16 --> 00:51:36.16
The people that are okay being exposed are the people that are strong.

960
00:51:36.16 --> 00:51:40.16
Like, I'm totally comfortable with my leadership capabilities.

961
00:51:40.16 --> 00:51:42.16
So when I have an issue, I'm like, hey, I don't feel comfortable with this.

962
00:51:42.16 --> 00:51:45.16
I'm not worried that somebody's not going to say like, oh, we don't think you can handle this.

963
00:51:45.16 --> 00:51:47.16
No, no, no, I actually, I know I can.

964
00:51:47.16 --> 00:51:49.16
I've been in more situation. So what do you got?

965
00:51:49.16 --> 00:51:50.16
Yeah.

966
00:51:50.16 --> 00:51:53.16
So if you're paranoid about looking weak, it means you probably are weak.

967
00:51:53.16 --> 00:51:58.16
If you don't care about being looking weak, it probably means you're coming along.

968
00:51:58.16 --> 00:51:59.16
You're doing pretty good.

969
00:51:59.16 --> 00:52:03.16
You're doing pretty good.

970
00:52:03.16 --> 00:52:04.16
You're doing pretty good.

971
00:52:04.16 --> 00:52:05.16
Yeah.

972
00:52:05.16 --> 00:52:05.16
Check.

973
00:52:05.16 --> 00:52:12.16
So you don't need a hard shell if you have a hard core, but you need a hard shell if you have a soft core.

974
00:52:12.16 --> 00:52:13.16
Yes, that is true.

975
00:52:13.16 --> 00:52:14.16
Kind of thing.

976
00:52:14.16 --> 00:52:15.16
Yes.

977
00:52:15.16 --> 00:52:16.16
Did you just make that up?

978
00:52:16.16 --> 00:52:20.16
Yeah, but I mean, I'm not looking at it like dang that was deep.

979
00:52:20.16 --> 00:52:22.16
I'm not thinking that.

980
00:52:22.16 --> 00:52:23.16
But that is a true statement.

981
00:52:23.16 --> 00:52:28.16
If you're if you're fundamentally sound on the internal and the internal and the internal.

982
00:52:28.16 --> 00:52:35.16
Meaningful structure of your of your being, then you can withstand attacks.

983
00:52:35.16 --> 00:52:37.16
So you don't need to put up a big wall.

984
00:52:37.16 --> 00:52:38.16
Right.

985
00:52:38.16 --> 00:52:38.16
Right.

986
00:52:38.16 --> 00:52:45.16
You know, but if you're fundamentally weak, internally, and the fundamentals of your of your being are weak,

987
00:52:45.16 --> 00:52:48.16
then you need to put up a big wall protection.

988
00:52:48.16 --> 00:52:53.16
You need to go around and bow up to people and yeah, you may be some weapons out there.

989
00:52:53.16 --> 00:53:00.16
It's really keep them away, you know, from guns, some heavy, there's something nice.

990
00:53:00.16 --> 00:53:01.16
All right.

991
00:53:01.16 --> 00:53:02.16
Good.

992
00:53:02.16 --> 00:53:04.16
Next question.

993
00:53:04.16 --> 00:53:09.16
Would love to hear tips for moving to wake up earlier.

994
00:53:09.16 --> 00:53:14.16
Alarms and not disturbing your spouse keeping alert throughout the day.

995
00:53:14.16 --> 00:53:17.16
You know, when you wake up early, these are, yeah, these are things.

996
00:53:17.16 --> 00:53:22.16
So tips for managing the implications around making that change to get up earlier while keeping the space.

997
00:53:22.16 --> 00:53:27.16
Or keeping the speed or keeping the peace at home and work and work.

998
00:53:27.16 --> 00:53:28.16
You put that.

999
00:53:28.16 --> 00:53:29.16
I did have a work.

1000
00:53:29.16 --> 00:53:34.16
He had some, he either made a typo or he's on the inside.

1001
00:53:34.16 --> 00:53:35.16
What that is.

1002
00:53:35.16 --> 00:53:38.16
That's a homage to the Portuguese accent.

1003
00:53:38.16 --> 00:53:39.16
Yes.

1004
00:53:39.16 --> 00:53:43.16
Well, no, it's a homage to the fake Portuguese accent.

1005
00:53:43.16 --> 00:53:44.16
No.

1006
00:53:44.16 --> 00:53:45.16
It's the real one.

1007
00:53:45.16 --> 00:53:46.16
Worky.

1008
00:53:46.16 --> 00:53:49.16
Anything adding like E at the end?

1009
00:53:49.16 --> 00:53:50.16
Like it'll come out.

1010
00:53:50.16 --> 00:53:52.16
Oh, yeah.

1011
00:53:52.16 --> 00:53:55.16
It can be exaggerated though by certain people.

1012
00:53:55.16 --> 00:53:56.16
Right.

1013
00:53:56.16 --> 00:53:57.16
Myself included.

1014
00:53:57.16 --> 00:53:58.16
Okay.

1015
00:53:58.16 --> 00:54:00.16
So how do wake up in the morning?

1016
00:54:00.16 --> 00:54:01.16
Number one.

1017
00:54:01.16 --> 00:54:03.16
Let's talk about one important piece.

1018
00:54:03.16 --> 00:54:05.16
How do you do without disturbing the spouse?

1019
00:54:05.16 --> 00:54:08.16
Because we don't want to, we don't want to make the spouse angry.

1020
00:54:08.16 --> 00:54:10.16
No adversarial relationships with the spouse.

1021
00:54:10.16 --> 00:54:11.16
No, at 430.

1022
00:54:11.16 --> 00:54:12.16
No, not at 430.

1023
00:54:12.16 --> 00:54:15.16
So one of the things real, real easy one out of the gate.

1024
00:54:15.16 --> 00:54:17.16
Get an escalating alarm.

1025
00:54:17.16 --> 00:54:19.16
So what that means is it starts off quiet.

1026
00:54:19.16 --> 00:54:20.16
And it gets louder.

1027
00:54:20.16 --> 00:54:22.16
It gets progressively louder.

1028
00:54:22.16 --> 00:54:26.16
I am a much lighter sleeper than my wife.

1029
00:54:26.16 --> 00:54:29.16
So this is not that big of a deal to me.

1030
00:54:29.16 --> 00:54:32.16
And I can't answer.

1031
00:54:32.16 --> 00:54:35.16
But I've slept with roommates at one sleep.

1032
00:54:35.16 --> 00:54:40.16
You know, like in the military, you got bunk together or whatever.

1033
00:54:40.16 --> 00:54:42.16
So I've dealt with this a little bit.

1034
00:54:42.16 --> 00:54:43.16
But it's really no factor.

1035
00:54:43.16 --> 00:54:44.16
Get an escalating alarm.

1036
00:54:44.16 --> 00:54:47.16
And then when that thing goes off,

1037
00:54:47.16 --> 00:54:50.16
you wake up before it gets too loud to wake your spouse.

1038
00:54:50.16 --> 00:54:51.16
It should be on your side of the bed.

1039
00:54:51.16 --> 00:54:52.16
So you can make it happen.

1040
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:56.16
Or you can pick a song that starts off nice and mellow.

1041
00:54:56.16 --> 00:54:58.16
And that kind of builds.

1042
00:54:58.16 --> 00:55:02.16
And for a long time, for this particular reason,

1043
00:55:02.16 --> 00:55:04.16
I used to have, um,

1044
00:55:04.16 --> 00:55:06.16
There's a band called The Sword.

1045
00:55:06.16 --> 00:55:07.16
Sure.

1046
00:55:07.16 --> 00:55:10.16
And they have a song called Iron Swan.

1047
00:55:10.16 --> 00:55:13.16
And it starts off nice and mellow.

1048
00:55:13.16 --> 00:55:16.16
If you don't get up in time, it's coming.

1049
00:55:16.16 --> 00:55:17.16
So you got it.

1050
00:55:17.16 --> 00:55:21.16
So it's like a kind of like a game within the game right there.

1051
00:55:21.16 --> 00:55:23.16
Where you got to beat the clock.

1052
00:55:23.16 --> 00:55:24.16
Yes.

1053
00:55:24.16 --> 00:55:25.16
You got to beat the clock.

1054
00:55:25.16 --> 00:55:26.16
You got to get up and turn that thing.

1055
00:55:26.16 --> 00:55:28.16
Because otherwise it's an end.

1056
00:55:28.16 --> 00:55:30.16
And then you're too late.

1057
00:55:30.16 --> 00:55:31.16
What is it, black Swan?

1058
00:55:31.16 --> 00:55:32.16
No.

1059
00:55:32.16 --> 00:55:33.16
Iron Swan.

1060
00:55:33.16 --> 00:55:34.16
It's the sword.

1061
00:55:34.16 --> 00:55:35.16
This is what it is.

1062
00:55:35.16 --> 00:55:36.16
Yeah.

1063
00:55:36.16 --> 00:55:38.16
Because there's, there's times in my life where

1064
00:55:38.16 --> 00:55:41.16
I will put like the ultimate

1065
00:55:41.16 --> 00:55:47.16
shocker of a tune in my playlist.

1066
00:55:47.16 --> 00:55:51.16
In my playlist that if I need to get up and I need to get up and get on it.

1067
00:55:51.16 --> 00:55:57.16
Like there's a song called Repeat Process by 100 Demons.

1068
00:55:57.16 --> 00:55:59.16
That song will get you out of bed.

1069
00:55:59.16 --> 00:56:01.16
It will get you out of bed.

1070
00:56:01.16 --> 00:56:02.16
When it kicks in, it just comes.

1071
00:56:02.16 --> 00:56:03.16
It comes.

1072
00:56:03.16 --> 00:56:07.16
It's like, it's like, getting, it's, it's like an explosion happens in your room.

1073
00:56:07.16 --> 00:56:09.16
And it's a great song by a great band.

1074
00:56:09.16 --> 00:56:10.16
But anyways.

1075
00:56:10.16 --> 00:56:14.16
So if, but in this case, you don't want to go with 100 Demons.

1076
00:56:14.16 --> 00:56:15.16
No.

1077
00:56:15.16 --> 00:56:17.16
You don't want to go with repeat process.

1078
00:56:17.16 --> 00:56:18.16
Mm-hmm.

1079
00:56:18.16 --> 00:56:20.16
You want to go with the sword to iron so on.

1080
00:56:20.16 --> 00:56:22.16
Or an escalating alarm.

1081
00:56:22.16 --> 00:56:26.16
Now, once you do that, you've got to have the gear pre-staged.

1082
00:56:26.16 --> 00:56:29.16
The gear has the morning gear has to be pre-staged.

1083
00:56:29.16 --> 00:56:31.16
So, so we're not in the dress.

1084
00:56:31.16 --> 00:56:32.16
We're not pulling open drawers.

1085
00:56:32.16 --> 00:56:33.16
We're not flipping on lights.

1086
00:56:33.16 --> 00:56:34.16
We're not searching for stuff.

1087
00:56:34.16 --> 00:56:35.16
No.

1088
00:56:35.16 --> 00:56:36.16
We get up.

1089
00:56:36.16 --> 00:56:37.16
We walk out of the room.

1090
00:56:37.16 --> 00:56:38.16
Yeah.

1091
00:56:38.16 --> 00:56:39.16
Quietly.

1092
00:56:39.16 --> 00:56:41.16
Then you get to either the bathroom.

1093
00:56:41.16 --> 00:56:44.16
Now, if you have the bathroom on suite,

1094
00:56:44.16 --> 00:56:47.16
maybe you have some stuff staged in the other bathroom in the house.

1095
00:56:47.16 --> 00:56:49.16
So you just walk right out of the room, shut the door in your good.

1096
00:56:49.16 --> 00:56:51.16
You made your escape.

1097
00:56:51.16 --> 00:56:52.16
Yep.

1098
00:56:52.16 --> 00:56:53.16
Oh.

1099
00:56:53.16 --> 00:56:54.16
And I'll tell you another thing.

1100
00:56:54.16 --> 00:56:55.16
Oh, heads up.

1101
00:56:55.16 --> 00:56:58.16
Make sure that you set off your secondary.

1102
00:56:58.16 --> 00:57:01.16
I mean, that you turn off your secondary and your tertiary alarms.

1103
00:57:01.16 --> 00:57:05.16
So if you're like me, and you see the multiple alarm clocks,

1104
00:57:05.16 --> 00:57:08.16
if you leave because they go off sequentially,

1105
00:57:08.16 --> 00:57:09.16
you know you got your first one.

1106
00:57:09.16 --> 00:57:10.16
Iphone.

1107
00:57:10.16 --> 00:57:11.16
Then you got your second one battery powered.

1108
00:57:11.16 --> 00:57:12.16
Then you get your third one wind up.

1109
00:57:12.16 --> 00:57:14.16
The wind up is the gnarly last one with the.

1110
00:57:14.16 --> 00:57:17.16
Right.

1111
00:57:17.16 --> 00:57:18.16
Right.

1112
00:57:18.16 --> 00:57:22.16
If you leave that thing, if you forget to shut that thing off before you walk out,

1113
00:57:22.16 --> 00:57:23.16
you can hear about it.

1114
00:57:23.16 --> 00:57:25.16
You can hear right.

1115
00:57:25.16 --> 00:57:27.16
Because now when it goes off, it's a startleer.

1116
00:57:27.16 --> 00:57:28.16
Because it doesn't go off.

1117
00:57:28.16 --> 00:57:32.16
I mean, most, you know, 50% of the time I'm out before the alarm is.

1118
00:57:32.16 --> 00:57:34.16
But if you leave that one on there, it's a startleer.

1119
00:57:34.16 --> 00:57:38.16
And then then your spouse is waking up in a panic mode.

1120
00:57:38.16 --> 00:57:40.16
Because now they don't know where it is.

1121
00:57:40.16 --> 00:57:41.16
Then there's effort.

1122
00:57:41.16 --> 00:57:43.16
They're being attacked.

1123
00:57:43.16 --> 00:57:45.16
It's, it's a gnarly situation.

1124
00:57:45.16 --> 00:57:49.16
So shut off the secondary and tertiary alarms.

1125
00:57:49.16 --> 00:57:51.16
And then get out of the room.

1126
00:57:51.16 --> 00:57:55.16
And then, you know, maybe you even have your toothbrush and your toothpaste staged

1127
00:57:55.16 --> 00:57:58.16
and another in the another bathroom or in a kitchen or whatever.

1128
00:57:58.16 --> 00:58:02.16
Got your workout gears not in a drawer by the bed where your pull and that open

1129
00:58:02.16 --> 00:58:06.16
and making that racket. No, you just get up and you leave.

1130
00:58:06.16 --> 00:58:09.16
So then, that's, that's how you do it.

1131
00:58:09.16 --> 00:58:11.16
That's how I do it.

1132
00:58:11.16 --> 00:58:16.16
And again, I've been in advantage because my wife is a pretty heavy sleeper.

1133
00:58:16.16 --> 00:58:19.16
She gets mad when I come home from a trip and late at night.

1134
00:58:19.16 --> 00:58:21.16
I do some unpacking in the night.

1135
00:58:21.16 --> 00:58:23.16
That can be a little frustrating for her.

1136
00:58:23.16 --> 00:58:26.16
But anyways, that's what she do.

1137
00:58:26.16 --> 00:58:31.16
Now, the next piece of this question was for alertness throughout the day.

1138
00:58:31.16 --> 00:58:34.16
What do you do to stay alerted throughout the day?

1139
00:58:34.16 --> 00:58:38.16
I think one of the things you have to do is check your diet.

1140
00:58:38.16 --> 00:58:41.16
Right. Check the diet.

1141
00:58:41.16 --> 00:58:47.16
Make sure in my opinion, make sure you're not ingesting a ton of carbohydrates.

1142
00:58:47.16 --> 00:58:50.16
Because those are going to make you tired.

1143
00:58:50.16 --> 00:58:54.16
They're going to make you excited or make you fired up for about 20 minutes.

1144
00:58:54.16 --> 00:58:56.16
I don't know. I haven't had them in a long time.

1145
00:58:56.16 --> 00:58:58.16
For like 20 minutes before you eat them.

1146
00:58:58.16 --> 00:59:00.16
Like, right when you actually, that's really what they're for.

1147
00:59:00.16 --> 00:59:01.16
Yeah, they're a cartel.

1148
00:59:01.16 --> 00:59:02.16
They're a cartel.

1149
00:59:02.16 --> 00:59:03.16
And it's an energy.

1150
00:59:03.16 --> 00:59:04.16
Yeah.

1151
00:59:04.16 --> 00:59:06.16
And they put you to sleep.

1152
00:59:06.16 --> 00:59:11.16
So when you eat it, it's basically the really basic sequence.

1153
00:59:11.16 --> 00:59:15.16
I'm going to do some output in the wild.

1154
00:59:15.16 --> 00:59:16.16
I'm going to go hunting on whatever.

1155
00:59:16.16 --> 00:59:18.16
I'm going to gather whatever.

1156
00:59:18.16 --> 00:59:20.16
I'm going to do some output.

1157
00:59:20.16 --> 00:59:21.16
That expanded some energy.

1158
00:59:21.16 --> 00:59:22.16
I'm going to need some energy.

1159
00:59:22.16 --> 00:59:24.16
And I'm going to need some rest.

1160
00:59:24.16 --> 00:59:28.16
When you get the energy, carbohydrates, food, anyway.

1161
00:59:28.16 --> 00:59:30.16
Serotonin.

1162
00:59:30.16 --> 00:59:33.16
Well, these are chemicals that induce you to go rest.

1163
00:59:33.16 --> 00:59:34.16
That's the sequence.

1164
00:59:34.16 --> 00:59:35.16
That's the process.

1165
00:59:35.16 --> 00:59:36.16
Don't forget about insulin.

1166
00:59:36.16 --> 00:59:37.16
Yeah.

1167
00:59:37.16 --> 00:59:39.16
Because the insulin also quit away.

1168
00:59:39.16 --> 00:59:41.16
The insulin's going to make you tired too.

1169
00:59:41.16 --> 00:59:42.16
So check your diet.

1170
00:59:42.16 --> 00:59:43.16
Check your diet.

1171
00:59:43.16 --> 00:59:45.16
I just had a guy on Twitter.

1172
00:59:45.16 --> 00:59:46.16
Man.

1173
00:59:46.16 --> 00:59:48.16
He's like, hey man, I'm tired during the day.

1174
00:59:48.16 --> 00:59:49.16
I'm dragging.

1175
00:59:49.16 --> 00:59:50.16
I'm just like, well, check your diet.

1176
00:59:50.16 --> 00:59:52.16
And he's like, well, I think it's okay.

1177
00:59:52.16 --> 00:59:54.16
I'm drinking a lot of energy drinks.

1178
00:59:54.16 --> 00:59:56.16
No.

1179
00:59:56.16 --> 00:59:58.16
Not good.

1180
00:59:58.16 --> 01:00:00.16
The energy drinks are addictive.

1181
01:00:00.16 --> 01:00:01.16
Yeah.

1182
01:00:01.16 --> 01:00:02.16
They're tasty.

1183
01:00:02.16 --> 01:00:04.16
They're addictive.

1184
01:00:04.16 --> 01:00:06.16
And they're filled with sugar.

1185
01:00:06.16 --> 01:00:07.16
Most of the time.

1186
01:00:07.16 --> 01:00:09.16
So you're going to get a major sugar rush.

1187
01:00:09.16 --> 01:00:10.16
And then you're going to crash.

1188
01:00:10.16 --> 01:00:12.16
So you've got to be careful that.

1189
01:00:12.16 --> 01:00:17.16
Also, you don't want to be on the crazy amount of caffeine.

1190
01:00:17.16 --> 01:00:18.16
All day.

1191
01:00:18.16 --> 01:00:19.16
And that's going to mess up your system as well.

1192
01:00:19.16 --> 01:00:22.16
Does the same thing is the caffeine rush.

1193
01:00:22.16 --> 01:00:23.16
And then the crash.

1194
01:00:23.16 --> 01:00:24.16
That's the same thing.

1195
01:00:24.16 --> 01:00:25.16
Same thing.

1196
01:00:25.16 --> 01:00:26.16
Yeah.

1197
01:00:26.16 --> 01:00:27.16
Yeah.

1198
01:00:27.16 --> 01:00:28.16
Yeah.

1199
01:00:28.16 --> 01:00:29.16
Yeah.

1200
01:00:29.16 --> 01:00:32.16
And what I'll tell you right now.

1201
01:00:32.16 --> 01:00:33.16
People ask me all the time.

1202
01:00:33.16 --> 01:00:36.16
They're surprised that I work out without caffeine in the morning.

1203
01:00:36.16 --> 01:00:38.16
But I'm telling you.

1204
01:00:38.16 --> 01:00:39.16
Give it a try.

1205
01:00:39.16 --> 01:00:40.16
Yeah.

1206
01:00:40.16 --> 01:00:41.16
Because it'll be harder.

1207
01:00:41.16 --> 01:00:44.16
Maybe it's harder for you to get out of bed.

1208
01:00:44.16 --> 01:00:50.16
Maybe it's harder for you to get into the gym with no caffeine.

1209
01:00:50.16 --> 01:00:53.16
And maybe it's harder for you to start your workout with no caffeine.

1210
01:00:53.16 --> 01:00:59.16
But once you start the workout, I don't think it's going to be that big of a deal.

1211
01:00:59.16 --> 01:01:03.16
And if it is good, make your workout harder.

1212
01:01:03.16 --> 01:01:05.16
You know, I don't think it's that big of a deal.

1213
01:01:05.16 --> 01:01:07.16
So don't become addicted to the caffeine.

1214
01:01:07.16 --> 01:01:09.16
And that's going to be because that can get problematic.

1215
01:01:09.16 --> 01:01:14.16
And then power nap talked about this before.

1216
01:01:14.16 --> 01:01:16.16
If you need to, you take a little power nap.

1217
01:01:16.16 --> 01:01:17.16
You take six to eight minutes.

1218
01:01:17.16 --> 01:01:18.16
You set your alarm clock.

1219
01:01:18.16 --> 01:01:20.16
You elevate your feet above your heart.

1220
01:01:20.16 --> 01:01:21.16
You lay down.

1221
01:01:21.16 --> 01:01:24.16
And you black out. If you're really tired, you six to eight minutes.

1222
01:01:24.16 --> 01:01:27.16
You feel like a rock star after one of those.

1223
01:01:27.16 --> 01:01:29.16
You know, agree.

1224
01:01:29.16 --> 01:01:32.16
And another thing you can do if you're tired during the day.

1225
01:01:32.16 --> 01:01:34.16
No big deal.

1226
01:01:34.16 --> 01:01:36.16
Just find a little corner somewhere.

1227
01:01:36.16 --> 01:01:37.16
Go bang some push ups out.

1228
01:01:37.16 --> 01:01:38.16
Go bang out.

1229
01:01:38.16 --> 01:01:39.16
Oh, 10 burpees.

1230
01:01:39.16 --> 01:01:41.16
Yeah, yeah, get the blood flowing.

1231
01:01:41.16 --> 01:01:42.16
Just get the blood flowing.

1232
01:01:42.16 --> 01:01:42.16
Yeah.

1233
01:01:42.16 --> 01:01:43.16
There's no way.

1234
01:01:43.16 --> 01:01:44.16
It's it's.

1235
01:01:44.16 --> 01:01:50.16
Physiologically impossible to do burpees and and remain tired.

1236
01:01:50.16 --> 01:01:56.16
Whatever burpees you can tell you, you've been since you turned into a physiology major over here tonight.

1237
01:01:56.16 --> 01:01:59.16
If you want to tell me what that does physiologically,

1238
01:01:59.16 --> 01:02:01.16
I don't know, but I do know this.

1239
01:02:01.16 --> 01:02:03.16
If you knock out 10 burpees,

1240
01:02:03.16 --> 01:02:05.16
this small person small prescription,

1241
01:02:05.16 --> 01:02:07.16
you will not be tired for at least a half an hour.

1242
01:02:07.16 --> 01:02:10.16
You're not going to be 10 burpees and then feel tired.

1243
01:02:10.16 --> 01:02:11.16
If you can't do it,

1244
01:02:11.16 --> 01:02:13.16
I can tell you why physiologically.

1245
01:02:13.16 --> 01:02:15.16
Indorphins get released.

1246
01:02:15.16 --> 01:02:16.16
Oh, there's stuff.

1247
01:02:16.16 --> 01:02:17.16
Adrenal.

1248
01:02:17.16 --> 01:02:19.16
Like when you know you're going to do physical activity,

1249
01:02:19.16 --> 01:02:20.16
when you know it, you have a job.

1250
01:02:20.16 --> 01:02:21.16
I'm not saying a huge adrenaline.

1251
01:02:21.16 --> 01:02:22.16
Just a little bit.

1252
01:02:22.16 --> 01:02:23.16
You get it.

1253
01:02:23.16 --> 01:02:24.16
I don't know.

1254
01:02:24.16 --> 01:02:25.16
Yeah.

1255
01:02:25.16 --> 01:02:26.16
A little bit.

1256
01:02:26.16 --> 01:02:28.16
Just still going part of it.

1257
01:02:28.16 --> 01:02:30.16
So that's those are some tips, I guess,

1258
01:02:30.16 --> 01:02:34.16
for alertness throughout the day that I use.

1259
01:02:34.16 --> 01:02:35.16
Yeah.

1260
01:02:35.16 --> 01:02:37.16
And forget not a better early in the morning.

1261
01:02:37.16 --> 01:02:39.16
Hey, and by the way, go to bed earlier at night.

1262
01:02:39.16 --> 01:02:40.16
Yeah.

1263
01:02:40.16 --> 01:02:41.16
Go to bed earlier at night.

1264
01:02:41.16 --> 01:02:43.16
I go to bed like I'm using around 11.

1265
01:02:43.16 --> 01:02:45.16
I don't recommend that.

1266
01:02:45.16 --> 01:02:48.16
I don't recommend going to bed at 11 and getting up at 430.

1267
01:02:48.16 --> 01:02:49.16
No, I don't recommend that.

1268
01:02:49.16 --> 01:02:51.16
I recommend going to bed when you get tired.

1269
01:02:51.16 --> 01:02:52.16
Shut your computer off.

1270
01:02:52.16 --> 01:02:57.16
Stop looking at the interwebs and go to sleep.

1271
01:02:57.16 --> 01:02:58.16
You know what?

1272
01:02:58.16 --> 01:03:00.16
Go read an actual book because that makes you tired.

1273
01:03:00.16 --> 01:03:01.16
Yeah.

1274
01:03:01.16 --> 01:03:02.16
That will make you tired.

1275
01:03:02.16 --> 01:03:04.16
That's like the opposite of burpees.

1276
01:03:04.16 --> 01:03:06.16
Go read, go read a book.

1277
01:03:06.16 --> 01:03:10.16
You know, and just sit there and you will get more tired.

1278
01:03:10.16 --> 01:03:11.16
Yeah.

1279
01:03:11.16 --> 01:03:13.16
Unless like a real exciting or interesting book.

1280
01:03:13.16 --> 01:03:14.16
Yeah.

1281
01:03:14.16 --> 01:03:19.16
Of course, of course, don't read blood meridian before you go to bed.

1282
01:03:19.16 --> 01:03:22.16
But and you're because you're a fast sleep fast sleeper.

1283
01:03:22.16 --> 01:03:23.16
Yeah.

1284
01:03:23.16 --> 01:03:24.16
Yeah.

1285
01:03:24.16 --> 01:03:25.16
You don't need that much sleep.

1286
01:03:25.16 --> 01:03:26.16
Yeah.

1287
01:03:26.16 --> 01:03:27.16
Yeah.

1288
01:03:27.16 --> 01:03:28.16
Yeah.

1289
01:03:28.16 --> 01:03:29.16
The no sleep thing that'll get you so quick.

1290
01:03:29.16 --> 01:03:32.16
You know, promptly put you into a crash the next day.

1291
01:03:32.16 --> 01:03:33.16
Yeah.

1292
01:03:33.16 --> 01:03:34.16
I don't know.

1293
01:03:34.16 --> 01:03:35.16
You can power it.

1294
01:03:35.16 --> 01:03:36.16
Well, I don't know.

1295
01:03:36.16 --> 01:03:40.16
If I can go the next man, I've even when you had the latest little baby.

1296
01:03:40.16 --> 01:03:41.16
Yeah.

1297
01:03:41.16 --> 01:03:43.16
You came in here on a couple hours sleep.

1298
01:03:43.16 --> 01:03:44.16
You're like rolled in here, ready to record.

1299
01:03:44.16 --> 01:03:45.16
You sat here.

1300
01:03:45.16 --> 01:03:46.16
You got after it.

1301
01:03:46.16 --> 01:03:47.16
Yeah.

1302
01:03:47.16 --> 01:03:47.16
It's true.

1303
01:03:47.16 --> 01:03:48.16
And there's all these different little things.

1304
01:03:48.16 --> 01:03:49.16
Doesn't that make you realize?

1305
01:03:49.16 --> 01:03:50.16
Yeah.

1306
01:03:50.16 --> 01:03:52.16
It makes you realize how much more you can do.

1307
01:03:52.16 --> 01:03:53.16
I think a lot of people.

1308
01:03:53.16 --> 01:03:54.16
It's like this.

1309
01:03:54.16 --> 01:03:56.16
And I don't want to go into this full subject right now.

1310
01:03:56.16 --> 01:03:59.16
But the other day, I did a 72 hour fast.

1311
01:03:59.16 --> 01:04:00.16
Right.

1312
01:04:00.16 --> 01:04:01.16
No food for 72 hours.

1313
01:04:01.16 --> 01:04:03.16
And there's a bunch of reasons we could talk about it.

1314
01:04:03.16 --> 01:04:04.16
Maybe we'll do it on later podcast.

1315
01:04:04.16 --> 01:04:05.16
I will say this though.

1316
01:04:05.16 --> 01:04:07.16
What one small thing.

1317
01:04:07.16 --> 01:04:12.16
If you go 72 hours without eating, it recalibrates.

1318
01:04:12.16 --> 01:04:15.16
You're hunger meter.

1319
01:04:15.16 --> 01:04:20.16
Because we just think, oh, I haven't had a donut in two hours.

1320
01:04:20.16 --> 01:04:21.16
I'm starving.

1321
01:04:21.16 --> 01:04:23.16
Like no, you're not starving.

1322
01:04:23.16 --> 01:04:24.16
You're not even hungry.

1323
01:04:24.16 --> 01:04:26.16
No, I'm close to hungry.

1324
01:04:26.16 --> 01:04:28.16
So recalibrate that thing.

1325
01:04:28.16 --> 01:04:29.16
Do a fast.

1326
01:04:29.16 --> 01:04:34.16
Even if you just don't eat for 24 hours, you realize that most of your hunger signals that are coming

1327
01:04:34.16 --> 01:04:35.16
to your brain are lies.

1328
01:04:35.16 --> 01:04:36.16
Yeah.

1329
01:04:36.16 --> 01:04:39.16
And I'm not saying they're lies like, oh, don't eat.

1330
01:04:39.16 --> 01:04:43.16
But I'm saying you don't need to eat and how liberating is it.

1331
01:04:43.16 --> 01:04:44.16
I was having so much fun.

1332
01:04:44.16 --> 01:04:45.16
I was on this fast.

1333
01:04:45.16 --> 01:04:47.16
And I'm just like, don't even need food.

1334
01:04:47.16 --> 01:04:48.16
I don't need food.

1335
01:04:48.16 --> 01:04:49.16
I don't need to eat.

1336
01:04:49.16 --> 01:04:51.16
That's the ultimate control.

1337
01:04:51.16 --> 01:04:52.16
Right.

1338
01:04:52.16 --> 01:04:52.16
What?

1339
01:04:52.16 --> 01:04:53.16
I don't need food.

1340
01:04:53.16 --> 01:04:55.16
Food is food is food is food is food is if you're weak.

1341
01:04:55.16 --> 01:04:56.16
You know what I mean?

1342
01:04:56.16 --> 01:04:59.16
It's that type of you get that mentality going.

1343
01:04:59.16 --> 01:05:00.16
And then guess what?

1344
01:05:00.16 --> 01:05:01.16
Now you're going to travel day.

1345
01:05:01.16 --> 01:05:03.16
And you go, oh, man.

1346
01:05:03.16 --> 01:05:05.16
I'm going to be in the airport all day today.

1347
01:05:05.16 --> 01:05:06.16
And I don't know what I'm going to eat.

1348
01:05:06.16 --> 01:05:07.16
Don't eat anything.

1349
01:05:07.16 --> 01:05:08.16
Yep.

1350
01:05:08.16 --> 01:05:09.16
You're too capable.

1351
01:05:09.16 --> 01:05:10.16
You're too capable.

1352
01:05:10.16 --> 01:05:11.16
You can go 72 hours.

1353
01:05:11.16 --> 01:05:13.16
It's a matter of fact, you can go like 30 days without food.

1354
01:05:13.16 --> 01:05:15.16
So going three days is not that big of a deal.

1355
01:05:15.16 --> 01:05:17.16
It's not even that big of a deal.

1356
01:05:17.16 --> 01:05:18.16
Yeah.

1357
01:05:18.16 --> 01:05:21.16
I did when I just did this 72 hour fast.

1358
01:05:21.16 --> 01:05:23.16
It was just not like I did everything normal.

1359
01:05:23.16 --> 01:05:24.16
I went to Jiu Jitsu.

1360
01:05:24.16 --> 01:05:25.16
I did work out of it.

1361
01:05:25.16 --> 01:05:26.16
It's quats.

1362
01:05:26.16 --> 01:05:27.16
It did pull up.

1363
01:05:27.16 --> 01:05:28.16
Everything was normal.

1364
01:05:28.16 --> 01:05:29.16
Everything was normal.

1365
01:05:29.16 --> 01:05:31.16
It's not that big crazy deal.

1366
01:05:31.16 --> 01:05:35.16
Just we just get so accustomed to just feed in the machine all the time.

1367
01:05:35.16 --> 01:05:37.16
And you got to have a, you know, you got to have a meal.

1368
01:05:37.16 --> 01:05:38.16
Every six hours.

1369
01:05:38.16 --> 01:05:39.16
And it's so at our fingertips.

1370
01:05:39.16 --> 01:05:40.16
Yeah.

1371
01:05:40.16 --> 01:05:41.16
But it's also you.

1372
01:05:41.16 --> 01:05:42.16
This is what I realize.

1373
01:05:42.16 --> 01:05:44.16
It's so inconvenient to have to eat all the time.

1374
01:05:44.16 --> 01:05:45.16
Oh man.

1375
01:05:45.16 --> 01:05:46.16
You know, you're not.

1376
01:05:46.16 --> 01:05:47.16
You're not.

1377
01:05:47.16 --> 01:05:49.16
So it's kind of nice to eat.

1378
01:05:49.16 --> 01:05:50.16
I don't want today.

1379
01:05:50.16 --> 01:05:51.16
Guess what?

1380
01:05:51.16 --> 01:05:52.16
But a big old stake on.

1381
01:05:52.16 --> 01:05:53.16
Get after it.

1382
01:05:53.16 --> 01:05:54.16
And yeah.

1383
01:05:54.16 --> 01:05:56.16
I mean, and again, hey, there's all kinds of people.

1384
01:05:56.16 --> 01:05:58.16
I mean, there's people that know.

1385
01:05:58.16 --> 01:06:02.16
This is one of the reasons I don't like talking about this particular topic.

1386
01:06:02.16 --> 01:06:06.16
Um, it's because there's a lot of people that like study this and know

1387
01:06:06.16 --> 01:06:07.16
a lot about this and not all of these facts.

1388
01:06:07.16 --> 01:06:13.16
So if I go into the research, well, I know the facts too, but I don't, I can't

1389
01:06:13.16 --> 01:06:15.16
I can't say they're called them, right?

1390
01:06:15.16 --> 01:06:21.16
I don't have the in-depth knowledge that Peter Ratia has on fasting.

1391
01:06:21.16 --> 01:06:22.16
You know what I mean?

1392
01:06:22.16 --> 01:06:23.16
Or Dom Dagestino.

1393
01:06:23.16 --> 01:06:25.16
Those guys, they're pH.

1394
01:06:25.16 --> 01:06:26.16
They're doctors.

1395
01:06:26.16 --> 01:06:27.16
I'm not a doctor.

1396
01:06:27.16 --> 01:06:28.16
Yeah.

1397
01:06:28.16 --> 01:06:29.16
I'm a knucklehead.

1398
01:06:29.16 --> 01:06:30.16
That was.

1399
01:06:30.16 --> 01:06:33.16
And another thing's people, what, you know, what did you do to prepare for your fasting?

1400
01:06:33.16 --> 01:06:35.16
Because I did need.

1401
01:06:35.16 --> 01:06:40.16
Yeah, I was with, I was with, late and we were on a trip and we had like a lunch.

1402
01:06:40.16 --> 01:06:45.16
And then we did a gig that night and I liked to eat before I do a gig and then after that,

1403
01:06:45.16 --> 01:06:49.16
we stayed up a little bit and did some work and then woke up in the morning at an early

1404
01:06:49.16 --> 01:06:52.16
flight and then I came home and I wanted to train so I worked out and I got done with that

1405
01:06:52.16 --> 01:06:54.16
and I went and did something else and the next thing I knew was 24 hours.

1406
01:06:54.16 --> 01:06:55.16
Like, all right, you know what?

1407
01:06:55.16 --> 01:06:57.16
The next thing I didn't feel too hungry says I don't know.

1408
01:06:57.16 --> 01:06:58.16
And it just held on.

1409
01:06:58.16 --> 01:06:59.16
So it wasn't no preparation.

1410
01:06:59.16 --> 01:07:01.16
Just got after it.

1411
01:07:01.16 --> 01:07:03.16
Again, people don't do this.

1412
01:07:03.16 --> 01:07:05.16
This is anecdotal.

1413
01:07:05.16 --> 01:07:08.16
Check with a physician or whatever you got to do don't listen to me.

1414
01:07:08.16 --> 01:07:11.16
Yeah, as far as like a recommendation you should do.

1415
01:07:11.16 --> 01:07:15.16
Because, you know, you are different and some to our fast.

1416
01:07:15.16 --> 01:07:16.16
Okay, I did it, man.

1417
01:07:16.16 --> 01:07:22.16
But I think really kind of the point that you're making or one of them anyway, I think is absolutely true.

1418
01:07:22.16 --> 01:07:26.16
So you're, you know, a lot of it is like habitual hunger.

1419
01:07:26.16 --> 01:07:29.16
But it goes beyond just like psychological habits.

1420
01:07:29.16 --> 01:07:30.16
It's like physiological.

1421
01:07:30.16 --> 01:07:32.16
It's like, okay, I'm used to getting food every four hours.

1422
01:07:32.16 --> 01:07:35.16
So when the four hour mark comes around physiologically,

1423
01:07:35.16 --> 01:07:36.16
your stomach can be like, right, my food.

1424
01:07:36.16 --> 01:07:38.16
Your mouth is everywhere in my food.

1425
01:07:38.16 --> 01:07:41.16
And then after a while, if you're like, hey, you don't get food this time, your stomach's okay.

1426
01:07:41.16 --> 01:07:42.16
Sometimes we don't get food.

1427
01:07:42.16 --> 01:07:43.16
Yeah.

1428
01:07:43.16 --> 01:07:45.16
So let's kind of act right, you know.

1429
01:07:45.16 --> 01:07:47.16
And then when the food comes, okay, we'll do that when that happens.

1430
01:07:47.16 --> 01:07:51.16
The recalibration is real though because then after I started eating again and then

1431
01:07:51.16 --> 01:07:53.16
the next thing I go, oh, I'm feeling hungry.

1432
01:07:53.16 --> 01:07:54.16
I'm going to eat something.

1433
01:07:54.16 --> 01:07:55.16
I'm actually not hungry.

1434
01:07:55.16 --> 01:07:56.16
So why am I eating?

1435
01:07:56.16 --> 01:07:58.16
Why am I eating it from not hungry?

1436
01:07:58.16 --> 01:07:59.16
Yeah.

1437
01:07:59.16 --> 01:08:02.16
Yeah. That's in my mind is controlling me when I should be controlling my mind.

1438
01:08:02.16 --> 01:08:03.16
Yeah.

1439
01:08:03.16 --> 01:08:03.16
You know?

1440
01:08:03.16 --> 01:08:06.16
So and that's another thing where you're, you're,

1441
01:08:06.16 --> 01:08:08.16
there's nothing new, right?

1442
01:08:08.16 --> 01:08:09.16
Your mind is so strong or whatever.

1443
01:08:09.16 --> 01:08:12.16
So you can trick yourself and it's goes for sleep too.

1444
01:08:12.16 --> 01:08:17.16
So if you think that you got nine hours of sleep, you'll be way less tired than,

1445
01:08:17.16 --> 01:08:19.16
okay, let's say two people, exactly.

1446
01:08:19.16 --> 01:08:20.16
I don't know what to do it.

1447
01:08:20.16 --> 01:08:21.16
Right.

1448
01:08:21.16 --> 01:08:22.16
I don't know what life experience would ever.

1449
01:08:22.16 --> 01:08:24.16
One guy believes the next morning,

1450
01:08:24.16 --> 01:08:26.16
okay, they both got eight hours sleep.

1451
01:08:26.16 --> 01:08:28.16
One guy believes he only got four hours sleep.

1452
01:08:28.16 --> 01:08:30.16
And one guy believes he got 10 hours sleep.

1453
01:08:30.16 --> 01:08:32.16
Typical plasibo scenario.

1454
01:08:32.16 --> 01:08:34.16
Yeah, but that's how your mind knows.

1455
01:08:34.16 --> 01:08:38.16
It knows. Like basically it's your mind accommodating what it thinks the stimulus is.

1456
01:08:38.16 --> 01:08:41.16
So the other twin, the four hour sleep believer,

1457
01:08:41.16 --> 01:08:43.16
he's going to be way more tired.

1458
01:08:43.16 --> 01:08:44.16
And he's going to be like, dang, where's that nap?

1459
01:08:44.16 --> 01:08:45.16
I was looking for it.

1460
01:08:45.16 --> 01:08:46.16
I need it whatever.

1461
01:08:46.16 --> 01:08:48.16
But the other one, imagine if you woke up every day and you were like,

1462
01:08:48.16 --> 01:08:50.16
I only got four hours of sleep and I'm going to crush today.

1463
01:08:50.16 --> 01:08:51.16
Exactly right there.

1464
01:08:51.16 --> 01:08:54.16
I actually believe I work better on less sleep.

1465
01:08:54.16 --> 01:08:56.16
How you like them apples?

1466
01:08:56.16 --> 01:08:57.16
Exactly.

1467
01:08:57.16 --> 01:08:59.16
And that's really, that's what was going to be my point there.

1468
01:08:59.16 --> 01:09:02.16
Were you like, you can told you, I've told you that before.

1469
01:09:02.16 --> 01:09:02.16
Yeah.

1470
01:09:02.16 --> 01:09:09.16
I've told, so I've told Echo before that when we were getting ready to record the podcast,

1471
01:09:09.16 --> 01:09:12.16
the day before I record the podcast, that night,

1472
01:09:12.16 --> 01:09:16.16
I like to sleep less like four hours.

1473
01:09:16.16 --> 01:09:19.16
Because I feel like it sharpens.

1474
01:09:19.16 --> 01:09:22.16
I'll tell you what it did to be quite honest with me.

1475
01:09:22.16 --> 01:09:26.16
What I think it does, it brings it.

1476
01:09:26.16 --> 01:09:33.16
It brings my emotions a little closer to the surface.

1477
01:09:33.16 --> 01:09:37.16
So like you feel like, I'm kind of under attack.

1478
01:09:37.16 --> 01:09:41.16
So I better, like, I better, like, part-knut right now.

1479
01:09:41.16 --> 01:09:42.16
I better, like, get my 360.

1480
01:09:42.16 --> 01:09:43.16
No, it's not like that.

1481
01:09:43.16 --> 01:09:45.16
It's like, no, this is what it is.

1482
01:09:45.16 --> 01:09:47.16
I can get more, like, when I'm reading something,

1483
01:09:47.16 --> 01:09:50.16
I'm more focused on it.

1484
01:09:50.16 --> 01:09:51.16
I'm more into it.

1485
01:09:51.16 --> 01:09:52.16
Like actively?

1486
01:09:52.16 --> 01:09:54.16
Yeah, because I think when I'm well rested,

1487
01:09:54.16 --> 01:09:57.16
I'm like a, like a rock solid, right?

1488
01:09:57.16 --> 01:09:58.16
I'm just a bird.

1489
01:09:58.16 --> 01:09:59.16
Oh, yeah.

1490
01:09:59.16 --> 01:10:01.16
When I'm a little, when I sleep less,

1491
01:10:01.16 --> 01:10:03.16
I'm a little bit more exposed.

1492
01:10:03.16 --> 01:10:06.16
I'm a little bit more vulnerable, right?

1493
01:10:06.16 --> 01:10:07.16
Mentally.

1494
01:10:07.16 --> 01:10:09.16
And I need that.

1495
01:10:09.16 --> 01:10:10.16
Right, man.

1496
01:10:10.16 --> 01:10:12.16
Because otherwise I just become very,

1497
01:10:12.16 --> 01:10:15.16
um, detached.

1498
01:10:15.16 --> 01:10:17.16
I become very detached.

1499
01:10:17.16 --> 01:10:20.16
And it's, you know, so I want it when I come in here,

1500
01:10:20.16 --> 01:10:23.16
I want to be on the, I want to be on the fringe a little bit.

1501
01:10:23.16 --> 01:10:24.16
Yeah, that's what I'm going to be exposed.

1502
01:10:24.16 --> 01:10:26.16
I want to be walking in here, me like, man,

1503
01:10:26.16 --> 01:10:28.16
this is going to be, this is intense.

1504
01:10:28.16 --> 01:10:30.16
This thing, not a walk in the park today.

1505
01:10:30.16 --> 01:10:32.16
No, this is going to be hard to let me see.

1506
01:10:32.16 --> 01:10:33.16
So I want it.

1507
01:10:33.16 --> 01:10:35.16
Yes, I want to be stressed a little bit when I come in here.

1508
01:10:35.16 --> 01:10:36.16
Yeah.

1509
01:10:36.16 --> 01:10:37.16
And I can dig it.

1510
01:10:37.16 --> 01:10:39.16
And I feel, I always feel like a blanket to sink thing in

1511
01:10:39.16 --> 01:10:44.16
you, Jitu, I feel better when I'm stressed and when I'm a little bit more,

1512
01:10:44.16 --> 01:10:46.16
yeah, a little bit more stressed a little bit more tension,

1513
01:10:46.16 --> 01:10:48.16
a little bit more pressure on myself.

1514
01:10:48.16 --> 01:10:49.16
I want to be there.

1515
01:10:49.16 --> 01:10:50.16
Yeah, I don't want to be there all the time.

1516
01:10:50.16 --> 01:10:54.16
I'll tell you what, just so everybody knows, there's some days where I'm tired.

1517
01:10:54.16 --> 01:10:58.16
When I'm just tired and I just, sometimes I just need a power nap,

1518
01:10:58.16 --> 01:11:01.16
so bad of a car, I'm literally falling asleep.

1519
01:11:01.16 --> 01:11:02.16
You know, and I hate that.

1520
01:11:02.16 --> 01:11:03.16
That's a horrible feeling.

1521
01:11:03.16 --> 01:11:06.16
But you know what, elevate your feet, set it on a proper eight minutes,

1522
01:11:06.16 --> 01:11:09.16
boom, you're going to wake up feeling like Superman.

1523
01:11:09.16 --> 01:11:15.16
You're kind of like when people hit themselves before they go lift.

1524
01:11:15.16 --> 01:11:18.16
Because it weighed, you mean they like slap themselves?

1525
01:11:18.16 --> 01:11:19.16
Yeah, for sure.

1526
01:11:19.16 --> 01:11:24.16
So the surface looks like, oh, he's getting fired up, but yeah, why is he getting fired up for the exact same reason that you're talking about?

1527
01:11:24.16 --> 01:11:29.16
Because if it's like, boom, like, I'm getting these things where I got to kind of bounce back from, right?

1528
01:11:29.16 --> 01:11:30.16
I'm under attack.

1529
01:11:30.16 --> 01:11:32.16
You're going to legitimate adrenaline rush, too.

1530
01:11:32.16 --> 01:11:33.16
Right.

1531
01:11:33.16 --> 01:11:35.16
So physiologically, it's the same exact sequence right there.

1532
01:11:35.16 --> 01:11:37.16
But you're just doing it consciously.

1533
01:11:37.16 --> 01:11:40.16
And instead of slaps, it's lack of sleep.

1534
01:11:40.16 --> 01:11:41.16
Yes.

1535
01:11:41.16 --> 01:11:44.16
Or what have you?

1536
01:11:44.16 --> 01:11:46.16
There you go.

1537
01:11:46.16 --> 01:11:48.16
That's, um,

1538
01:11:48.16 --> 01:11:50.16
I don't know what to tell you.

1539
01:11:50.16 --> 01:11:55.16
And everyone's going to attack me on social media for not sleeping, not eating.

1540
01:11:55.16 --> 01:11:57.16
And all that.

1541
01:11:57.16 --> 01:11:58.16
Yeah.

1542
01:11:58.16 --> 01:12:00.16
Well, sorry.

1543
01:12:00.16 --> 01:12:02.16
I don't know what to tell you.

1544
01:12:02.16 --> 01:12:03.16
I don't know what to tell you.

1545
01:12:03.16 --> 01:12:05.16
I appreciate your advice.

1546
01:12:05.16 --> 01:12:07.16
I know I should, I do know I should sleep more.

1547
01:12:07.16 --> 01:12:09.16
I do know I should eat, you know, better.

1548
01:12:09.16 --> 01:12:10.16
I'm sorry.

1549
01:12:10.16 --> 01:12:11.16
What does that mean even me?

1550
01:12:11.16 --> 01:12:12.16
I don't know.

1551
01:12:12.16 --> 01:12:12.16
I know.

1552
01:12:12.16 --> 01:12:13.16
I should.

1553
01:12:13.16 --> 01:12:14.16
The word should.

1554
01:12:14.16 --> 01:12:15.16
What does that even mean?

1555
01:12:15.16 --> 01:12:16.16
You should.

1556
01:12:16.16 --> 01:12:18.16
It, a joke. Don't be you anymore.

1557
01:12:18.16 --> 01:12:19.16
Well, it's true.

1558
01:12:19.16 --> 01:12:21.16
It'd be different than you.

1559
01:12:21.16 --> 01:12:22.16
That's what that's.

1560
01:12:22.16 --> 01:12:24.16
Well, actually actually the point out.

1561
01:12:24.16 --> 01:12:27.16
The, what I was going to say earlier is just like,

1562
01:12:27.16 --> 01:12:29.16
what you're saying, the, like,

1563
01:12:29.16 --> 01:12:32.16
you're not citing all this science and making claims about like,

1564
01:12:32.16 --> 01:12:34.16
how this is going to benefit you or nothing like that.

1565
01:12:34.16 --> 01:12:35.16
That's not what you're doing.

1566
01:12:35.16 --> 01:12:36.16
It's, it is anecdotal.

1567
01:12:36.16 --> 01:12:40.16
And I think the point is that if you push yourself through certain situations,

1568
01:12:40.16 --> 01:12:43.16
and you prove it to yourself that you can function just fine with,

1569
01:12:43.16 --> 01:12:45.16
I don't know, five hours sleep rather than eight.

1570
01:12:45.16 --> 01:12:48.16
One or two times or whatever or however,

1571
01:12:48.16 --> 01:12:49.16
and you know that you can do that.

1572
01:12:49.16 --> 01:12:54.16
Like, really, you know, we talked about this before where you get kind of dependent on certain things.

1573
01:12:54.16 --> 01:12:58.16
And then to the point where you believe that you can't function without it,

1574
01:12:58.16 --> 01:13:01.16
whether it be sleep, whether it be coffee in the morning,

1575
01:13:01.16 --> 01:13:04.16
whatever or eating every four hours.

1576
01:13:04.16 --> 01:13:08.16
Like when I was really into like weightlifting and bodybuilding type stuff,

1577
01:13:08.16 --> 01:13:11.16
I remember thinking, man, I got to, I got to hurry up and eat.

1578
01:13:11.16 --> 01:13:13.16
It's four hours or whatever.

1579
01:13:13.16 --> 01:13:16.16
And then kind of later on in life, man, I've got, like, I haven't eaten yet today.

1580
01:13:16.16 --> 01:13:18.16
And it's late in the day.

1581
01:13:18.16 --> 01:13:19.16
I'm fine.

1582
01:13:19.16 --> 01:13:20.16
You're not.

1583
01:13:20.16 --> 01:13:21.16
I'm not losing my game.

1584
01:13:21.16 --> 01:13:23.16
Yeah, whatever games, whatever games.

1585
01:13:23.16 --> 01:13:25.16
But games game, whatever.

1586
01:13:25.16 --> 01:13:28.16
So once you prove it to yourself, it's like, if you stay up all night,

1587
01:13:28.16 --> 01:13:31.16
when you have worked the next day and you do your work,

1588
01:13:31.16 --> 01:13:35.16
when you go to bed, you can be like, hey, if I had to, I could do that again.

1589
01:13:35.16 --> 01:13:39.16
That is another thing that I enjoy about pushing those envelopes is,

1590
01:13:39.16 --> 01:13:42.16
it feels really good to go to bed when you've been awake for a long time.

1591
01:13:42.16 --> 01:13:45.16
It feels really good to eat a meal when you have an eat for a while.

1592
01:13:45.16 --> 01:13:47.16
You appreciate it more.

1593
01:13:47.16 --> 01:13:54.16
Yeah, that's true, but that's kind of a cycle way of invoking appreciation.

1594
01:13:54.16 --> 01:13:55.16
Okay.

1595
01:13:55.16 --> 01:13:56.16
My opinion.

1596
01:13:56.16 --> 01:13:57.16
Understood.

1597
01:13:57.16 --> 01:13:59.16
Mixed question.

1598
01:13:59.16 --> 01:14:01.16
Oh, back to the iron swan.

1599
01:14:01.16 --> 01:14:02.16
That's it.

1600
01:14:02.16 --> 01:14:03.16
Yeah.

1601
01:14:03.16 --> 01:14:03.16
That's the song.

1602
01:14:03.16 --> 01:14:04.16
Yes.

1603
01:14:04.16 --> 01:14:05.16
Just a reminder.

1604
01:14:05.16 --> 01:14:06.16
Give it a try.

1605
01:14:06.16 --> 01:14:06.16
No.

1606
01:14:06.16 --> 01:14:07.16
The sword.

1607
01:14:07.16 --> 01:14:09.16
Next question.

1608
01:14:09.16 --> 01:14:13.16
What's the best way to handle awful random people?

1609
01:14:13.16 --> 01:14:22.16
Say, bunch of intimidating thugs on a bus or a violent, scary drunk person?

1610
01:14:22.16 --> 01:14:27.16
Well, and there's even more awful random people out there that you might need to look out for.

1611
01:14:27.16 --> 01:14:32.16
I think this is a, you know, obviously you got people that are pointed criminals that are coming after you.

1612
01:14:32.16 --> 01:14:38.16
You got terrorists that might be coming after you or just trying to do random acts of mass violence.

1613
01:14:38.16 --> 01:14:40.16
So those are those are particular type.

1614
01:14:40.16 --> 01:14:47.16
I think that this is a question directed for more of of something that could easily happen to people.

1615
01:14:47.16 --> 01:14:48.16
Right.

1616
01:14:48.16 --> 01:14:56.16
Random people that are being jerks or thugs or people that are drunk or higher would have brought.

1617
01:14:56.16 --> 01:14:57.16
Okay.

1618
01:14:57.16 --> 01:14:59.16
So obviously, what do we want to do?

1619
01:14:59.16 --> 01:15:01.16
We want to be prepared.

1620
01:15:01.16 --> 01:15:05.16
So to start with, you want to be in a legal physical condition.

1621
01:15:05.16 --> 01:15:09.16
So I mean, you want to work out. You want to be ready to handle yourself.

1622
01:15:09.16 --> 01:15:12.16
Physically, you want to know how to fight.

1623
01:15:12.16 --> 01:15:15.16
That means you need to train.

1624
01:15:15.16 --> 01:15:17.16
Do you do boxing, mojta wrestling.

1625
01:15:17.16 --> 01:15:22.16
You, if you're in a high crime area, you're in a high threat area.

1626
01:15:22.16 --> 01:15:25.16
And you think this stuff is really going to happen out there.

1627
01:15:25.16 --> 01:15:26.16
Then guess what?

1628
01:15:26.16 --> 01:15:29.16
You need to get a firearm.

1629
01:15:29.16 --> 01:15:30.16
You need to learn how to shoot a firearm.

1630
01:15:30.16 --> 01:15:32.16
You need to train with the firearm.

1631
01:15:32.16 --> 01:15:36.16
You need to understand the ramifications of utilizing a firearm.

1632
01:15:36.16 --> 01:15:39.16
And then you need to carry it so you can protect yourself.

1633
01:15:39.16 --> 01:15:43.16
And those same things go, if you decide you're going to carry any kind of weapon.

1634
01:15:43.16 --> 01:15:52.16
Whether it's pepper spray or a mace or an ass or a knife.

1635
01:15:52.16 --> 01:15:55.16
Anything that you're going to carry, you better know what you're doing.

1636
01:15:55.16 --> 01:15:57.16
You need to prepare with it.

1637
01:15:57.16 --> 01:16:01.16
So that's what you need to do to be prepared.

1638
01:16:01.16 --> 01:16:04.16
Okay, that's, that's what.

1639
01:16:04.16 --> 01:16:05.16
And and and and and and you don't have said this before.

1640
01:16:05.16 --> 01:16:07.16
I said it on the Sam Harris podcast.

1641
01:16:07.16 --> 01:16:11.16
If you, if you do these things, if you work on your physical condition,

1642
01:16:11.16 --> 01:16:14.16
if you work on your fighting, if you work on your shooting, if you work on your,

1643
01:16:14.16 --> 01:16:18.16
your weapon skills, and you never have to use them.

1644
01:16:18.16 --> 01:16:19.16
Great.

1645
01:16:19.16 --> 01:16:22.16
I will still say it has not been wasted time.

1646
01:16:22.16 --> 01:16:25.16
It has been time that has made you a better person.

1647
01:16:25.16 --> 01:16:27.16
It's imposed discipline on you.

1648
01:16:27.16 --> 01:16:29.16
It's gotten you better physical conditioning.

1649
01:16:29.16 --> 01:16:31.16
It's just good for you.

1650
01:16:31.16 --> 01:16:35.16
So regardless, you should be training in these type of situations.

1651
01:16:35.16 --> 01:16:40.16
Now, once you get to this type of situation, first of all, how did you get that?

1652
01:16:40.16 --> 01:16:42.16
Because we need to have situational awareness.

1653
01:16:42.16 --> 01:16:46.16
Right? How are you not paying attention to what's going on around you?

1654
01:16:46.16 --> 01:16:49.16
You need to pay attention to what's going on around you.

1655
01:16:49.16 --> 01:16:54.16
And then you watch for these scenarios that could unfold and you avoid them.

1656
01:16:54.16 --> 01:16:55.16
Period.

1657
01:16:55.16 --> 01:16:59.16
So, so how are you getting stuck on a bus with a bunch of maniacs?

1658
01:16:59.16 --> 01:17:00.16
Right?

1659
01:17:00.16 --> 01:17:01.16
There's something.

1660
01:17:01.16 --> 01:17:02.16
When they got on, you got off.

1661
01:17:02.16 --> 01:17:04.16
That's a real simple.

1662
01:17:04.16 --> 01:17:04.16
Right?

1663
01:17:04.16 --> 01:17:07.16
Or you go to get on and you see these knuckleheads, you walk right back off.

1664
01:17:07.16 --> 01:17:10.16
I mean, that's that's pretty easy.

1665
01:17:10.16 --> 01:17:12.16
And all there's a bunch of knuckleheads walking down the street towards you.

1666
01:17:12.16 --> 01:17:12.16
Cool.

1667
01:17:12.16 --> 01:17:14.16
Cross the street walking on the other side.

1668
01:17:14.16 --> 01:17:15.16
Situation awareness.

1669
01:17:15.16 --> 01:17:16.16
Oh, you hear them coming up behind you?

1670
01:17:16.16 --> 01:17:17.16
Cool.

1671
01:17:17.16 --> 01:17:18.16
Step off.

1672
01:17:18.16 --> 01:17:19.16
Cross the street.

1673
01:17:19.16 --> 01:17:20.16
Avoid.

1674
01:17:20.16 --> 01:17:22.16
We want to be have situational awareness.

1675
01:17:22.16 --> 01:17:29.16
That's going to solve that should solve 99% of your problems.

1676
01:17:29.16 --> 01:17:30.16
Okay.

1677
01:17:30.16 --> 01:17:34.16
Is being aware of your surroundings, understanding your situation.

1678
01:17:34.16 --> 01:17:35.16
Planning.

1679
01:17:35.16 --> 01:17:38.16
What about just simple planning? Like, where are you going?

1680
01:17:38.16 --> 01:17:39.16
When are you going to come home?

1681
01:17:39.16 --> 01:17:43.16
You know, if you took a subway into the city at night and you know you're going to come and home.

1682
01:17:43.16 --> 01:17:45.16
Late at night and you're alone.

1683
01:17:45.16 --> 01:17:48.16
And you are suspect of what's happened.

1684
01:17:48.16 --> 01:17:51.16
Maybe you get an Uber instead of riding the subway.

1685
01:17:51.16 --> 01:17:57.16
It's just planning that comes into play as well to avoid these situations.

1686
01:17:57.16 --> 01:18:03.16
Now, if you do get caught in these situations,

1687
01:18:03.16 --> 01:18:08.16
here's a couple recommendations.

1688
01:18:08.16 --> 01:18:09.16
Okay.

1689
01:18:09.16 --> 01:18:17.16
My number one is to kind of do your best to detach from from the scenario.

1690
01:18:17.16 --> 01:18:19.16
Right. So you got, let's say you're on a bus.

1691
01:18:19.16 --> 01:18:21.16
And there's a bunch of people acting crazy.

1692
01:18:21.16 --> 01:18:24.16
And they jumped on right after you got on and you couldn't get off in time.

1693
01:18:24.16 --> 01:18:25.16
So now you're on the bus with them.

1694
01:18:25.16 --> 01:18:27.16
I want you to detach from them.

1695
01:18:27.16 --> 01:18:29.16
So that means you're not looking at them.

1696
01:18:29.16 --> 01:18:30.16
You're not staring at them.

1697
01:18:30.16 --> 01:18:32.16
You're not being all intimidated.

1698
01:18:32.16 --> 01:18:33.16
You want to just detach.

1699
01:18:33.16 --> 01:18:35.16
Just do what you would normally do.

1700
01:18:35.16 --> 01:18:36.16
You know, everyone carries a phone these days.

1701
01:18:36.16 --> 01:18:37.16
Break out your phone.

1702
01:18:37.16 --> 01:18:38.16
Start looking at your phone.

1703
01:18:38.16 --> 01:18:39.16
Pull out your paper.

1704
01:18:39.16 --> 01:18:40.16
Start looking at your paper.

1705
01:18:40.16 --> 01:18:43.16
Study if you don't have either one of those to look outside.

1706
01:18:43.16 --> 01:18:44.16
Look at the passing.

1707
01:18:44.16 --> 01:18:48.16
Just don't enter their world.

1708
01:18:48.16 --> 01:18:51.16
Don't become a part of their thing that they have going on.

1709
01:18:51.16 --> 01:18:53.16
Because what they want you is they want you to make eye contact.

1710
01:18:53.16 --> 01:18:55.16
What they want you is glance over them.

1711
01:18:55.16 --> 01:18:57.16
What they want you to do is enter their world.

1712
01:18:57.16 --> 01:19:02.16
Because a lot of times, he's knuckleheads that they're in their own world.

1713
01:19:02.16 --> 01:19:04.16
And you actually have to penetrate their world.

1714
01:19:04.16 --> 01:19:05.16
If you want to get in there.

1715
01:19:05.16 --> 01:19:06.16
So what you want.

1716
01:19:06.16 --> 01:19:08.16
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to remain.

1717
01:19:08.16 --> 01:19:10.16
I'm not going to, I'm not going to coward though.

1718
01:19:10.16 --> 01:19:11.16
There's a difference.

1719
01:19:11.16 --> 01:19:12.16
Okay.

1720
01:19:12.16 --> 01:19:14.16
Because if you give the impression of you're just like countering and scared,

1721
01:19:14.16 --> 01:19:16.16
well, then there, that's that's entering their world.

1722
01:19:16.16 --> 01:19:18.16
And they're going to recognize that.

1723
01:19:18.16 --> 01:19:21.16
But if you're just, hey, sitting here just doing what you normally do.

1724
01:19:21.16 --> 01:19:22.16
And it's not a big deal.

1725
01:19:22.16 --> 01:19:23.16
You do this all the time.

1726
01:19:23.16 --> 01:19:24.16
You don't care about them.

1727
01:19:24.16 --> 01:19:25.16
Don't care about me.

1728
01:19:25.16 --> 01:19:26.16
Leave me alone.

1729
01:19:26.16 --> 01:19:29.16
That's, that's where I'm going.

1730
01:19:29.16 --> 01:19:32.16
Now, if for whatever reason I make some kind of eye contact.

1731
01:19:32.16 --> 01:19:33.16
Right.

1732
01:19:33.16 --> 01:19:34.16
Now I made the eye contact.

1733
01:19:34.16 --> 01:19:35.16
I've entered their world.

1734
01:19:35.16 --> 01:19:37.16
I'm going to go ahead and give them a little head nod.

1735
01:19:37.16 --> 01:19:40.16
You know, just a little, just a little regular head nod.

1736
01:19:40.16 --> 01:19:41.16
Like I would do with you.

1737
01:19:41.16 --> 01:19:44.16
If I saw you on the street, you know, just a little respectful,

1738
01:19:44.16 --> 01:19:45.16
little head nod.

1739
01:19:45.16 --> 01:19:47.16
And then I'm going to go right back to what I was doing.

1740
01:19:47.16 --> 01:19:48.16
I'm going to go right back out of their world.

1741
01:19:48.16 --> 01:19:49.16
I acknowledge their world.

1742
01:19:49.16 --> 01:19:52.16
I'm not going to give a bunch of, I'm not going to look scared.

1743
01:19:52.16 --> 01:19:54.16
But I'm not going to look aggressive.

1744
01:19:54.16 --> 01:19:55.16
I'm just going to be respectful.

1745
01:19:55.16 --> 01:19:56.16
A little head nod.

1746
01:19:56.16 --> 01:19:58.16
You know, if we have a good night.

1747
01:19:58.16 --> 01:19:59.16
It's good.

1748
01:19:59.16 --> 01:20:03.16
And then go, go back to your business.

1749
01:20:03.16 --> 01:20:05.16
Again, I just want to detach from them.

1750
01:20:05.16 --> 01:20:06.16
That's my attitude.

1751
01:20:06.16 --> 01:20:07.16
I wanted to detach from them.

1752
01:20:07.16 --> 01:20:12.16
And this avoids them saying, you know, like if they're looking at you and you don't look back

1753
01:20:12.16 --> 01:20:15.16
or they're just like bearing down on you.

1754
01:20:15.16 --> 01:20:17.16
Hey, you know, hey, why aren't you?

1755
01:20:17.16 --> 01:20:19.16
Why are you ignoring me or whatever?

1756
01:20:19.16 --> 01:20:21.16
You too cool for me or something like that.

1757
01:20:21.16 --> 01:20:23.16
So sometimes you go, you know, look, little head nod.

1758
01:20:23.16 --> 01:20:25.16
It's all good.

1759
01:20:25.16 --> 01:20:30.16
If, if now if they do start, now see it, I'm escalating this.

1760
01:20:30.16 --> 01:20:31.16
So they're escalating this.

1761
01:20:31.16 --> 01:20:35.16
So now if they do start to escalate this thing,

1762
01:20:35.16 --> 01:20:37.16
it like, like, you know, what are you looking at?

1763
01:20:37.16 --> 01:20:39.16
Or one of those things?

1764
01:20:39.16 --> 01:20:40.16
It's just again.

1765
01:20:40.16 --> 01:20:44.16
What you're trying to do is you're trying to de-escalate without being appearing

1766
01:20:44.16 --> 01:20:49.16
vulnerable, you know, so maybe it's just, you know, hey, no issue here.

1767
01:20:49.16 --> 01:20:51.16
You know, just something simple like that.

1768
01:20:51.16 --> 01:20:53.16
No, I'm good.

1769
01:20:53.16 --> 01:20:55.16
Um, like, what are you doing?

1770
01:20:55.16 --> 01:20:57.16
Just riding the bus home.

1771
01:20:57.16 --> 01:21:01.16
You know what I mean, just real matter of fact, just didn't go trying to get back.

1772
01:21:01.16 --> 01:21:06.16
But, you know, you might want to just even try and and connect a little connection.

1773
01:21:06.16 --> 01:21:09.16
Instead of I'm trying to go home, because that might piss some people off because they don't have a home.

1774
01:21:09.16 --> 01:21:11.16
Or their home is a bad place.

1775
01:21:11.16 --> 01:21:15.16
So what might be better than saying that is, you know, I just got done with work.

1776
01:21:15.16 --> 01:21:17.16
Now you're just a work man, right?

1777
01:21:17.16 --> 01:21:20.16
Of course you might be doing something that doesn't have a job or lost their jobs.

1778
01:21:20.16 --> 01:21:22.16
So I'm saying you're not going to come up with a great.

1779
01:21:22.16 --> 01:21:29.16
But my point here is just you're just going to try and make simple, non-confrontational statements.

1780
01:21:29.16 --> 01:21:33.16
That don't give them anything to grab onto because that's what they want.

1781
01:21:33.16 --> 01:21:37.16
They want something, they want something to grab onto, you know,

1782
01:21:37.16 --> 01:21:39.16
that's what they're looking for.

1783
01:21:39.16 --> 01:21:41.16
So you don't want to let that happen.

1784
01:21:41.16 --> 01:21:46.16
Now things can still continue to escalate.

1785
01:21:46.16 --> 01:21:53.16
You know, you get someone that's determined to be a jerk or determined to be hostile

1786
01:21:53.16 --> 01:21:58.16
to determine the aggressive now I'll tell you that if you train, then you work out,

1787
01:21:58.16 --> 01:22:02.16
and you do do do do do do do do, and you have skills.

1788
01:22:02.16 --> 01:22:04.16
People know it.

1789
01:22:04.16 --> 01:22:10.16
People people that are belligerence generally can tell.

1790
01:22:10.16 --> 01:22:16.16
Even in a drunken state when you square off with someone or you look at someone

1791
01:22:16.16 --> 01:22:20.16
and they have an attitude of like look, I do this all the time.

1792
01:22:20.16 --> 01:22:22.16
I'm good.

1793
01:22:22.16 --> 01:22:24.16
You want to fight them here.

1794
01:22:24.16 --> 01:22:27.16
Not saying that, but just a look and people can tell.

1795
01:22:27.16 --> 01:22:30.16
If they're real troublemakers, they can tell.

1796
01:22:30.16 --> 01:22:32.16
Now sometimes that's not a good thing because I mean,

1797
01:22:32.16 --> 01:22:34.16
you're going to do the challenge, you know?

1798
01:22:34.16 --> 01:22:36.16
So you got to watch out for that.

1799
01:22:36.16 --> 01:22:41.16
So I think that that's right, even though on the internet,

1800
01:22:41.16 --> 01:22:44.16
it might seem like it's telling a different story.

1801
01:22:44.16 --> 01:22:47.16
You know, it's like, oh, guy confronts the wrong guy,

1802
01:22:47.16 --> 01:22:49.16
you know, guy street felt confronts,

1803
01:22:49.16 --> 01:22:52.16
you just semester or something and then it shows that they actually

1804
01:22:52.16 --> 01:22:53.16
fought.

1805
01:22:53.16 --> 01:22:55.16
So it kind of seems like, oh, no, they don't know.

1806
01:22:55.16 --> 01:22:57.16
Obviously out there.

1807
01:22:57.16 --> 01:22:58.16
No, they, but that's rare, man.

1808
01:22:58.16 --> 01:23:00.16
And that's why it makes the internet.

1809
01:23:00.16 --> 01:23:03.16
So it's rare, typically, yeah, and this is no guarantee.

1810
01:23:03.16 --> 01:23:04.16
But I'm the same.

1811
01:23:04.16 --> 01:23:07.16
I could tell even before I started doing GJ2.

1812
01:23:07.16 --> 01:23:09.16
You know, I could tell if somebody was ready to rumble.

1813
01:23:09.16 --> 01:23:12.16
I have, I think it's like, I was ready to rumble.

1814
01:23:12.16 --> 01:23:16.16
No fight training to a guy who was belittred to me directly.

1815
01:23:16.16 --> 01:23:17.16
Right.

1816
01:23:17.16 --> 01:23:18.16
Terry was there.

1817
01:23:18.16 --> 01:23:21.16
We were working and all I did was act like I knew.

1818
01:23:21.16 --> 01:23:22.16
Yeah.

1819
01:23:22.16 --> 01:23:23.16
I didn't know by the way.

1820
01:23:23.16 --> 01:23:25.16
Act like I knew an in front of everybody.

1821
01:23:25.16 --> 01:23:27.16
I was like, oh, hey, I'm sorry, man.

1822
01:23:27.16 --> 01:23:28.16
It's my bad.

1823
01:23:28.16 --> 01:23:30.16
I belittled a little bit bigger than me too.

1824
01:23:30.16 --> 01:23:32.16
And he just said it, but I was ready to,

1825
01:23:32.16 --> 01:23:34.16
I was ready to do the best fighting I could.

1826
01:23:34.16 --> 01:23:36.16
Because it was kind of go time at that point.

1827
01:23:36.16 --> 01:23:37.16
Yeah.

1828
01:23:37.16 --> 01:23:39.16
He was like, you know, the kind of guy where he's talking.

1829
01:23:39.16 --> 01:23:40.16
He was like, yeah, man, I'm from Chicago.

1830
01:23:40.16 --> 01:23:43.16
And he's like rubbing against me in my face kind of not like,

1831
01:23:43.16 --> 01:23:45.16
I want to fight you, but just like, like,

1832
01:23:45.16 --> 01:23:47.16
like, like, almost like a dogwood, you know,

1833
01:23:47.16 --> 01:23:49.16
and rubbing against me.

1834
01:23:49.16 --> 01:23:51.16
And then whatever, you know,

1835
01:23:51.16 --> 01:23:53.16
I made like, okay, we're about to fight.

1836
01:23:53.16 --> 01:23:54.16
Took on my jacket.

1837
01:23:54.16 --> 01:23:55.16
I real quick or whatever.

1838
01:23:55.16 --> 01:23:57.16
And, um, and it was like, all right.

1839
01:23:57.16 --> 01:23:59.16
I think this go just like how you're saying,

1840
01:23:59.16 --> 01:24:00.16
no, just real matter.

1841
01:24:00.16 --> 01:24:01.16
That calm real matter.

1842
01:24:01.16 --> 01:24:02.16
Yeah.

1843
01:24:02.16 --> 01:24:03.16
You do this all the time.

1844
01:24:03.16 --> 01:24:03.16
Yep.

1845
01:24:03.16 --> 01:24:06.16
And the thing, I understand that it is on right now.

1846
01:24:06.16 --> 01:24:07.16
Understand.

1847
01:24:07.16 --> 01:24:09.16
And then the guy and he's surprisingly,

1848
01:24:09.16 --> 01:24:10.16
it's not surprising.

1849
01:24:10.16 --> 01:24:12.16
Hey, my bad, my bad bro, my bad, my bad,

1850
01:24:12.16 --> 01:24:13.16
my bad, my bad, my bad, my bad, my bad,

1851
01:24:13.16 --> 01:24:14.16
in front of everybody.

1852
01:24:14.16 --> 01:24:17.16
It's not surprising because people that act like that

1853
01:24:17.16 --> 01:24:21.16
are weak and they're insecure and they're acting on that.

1854
01:24:21.16 --> 01:24:23.16
And so when somebody stands up to them,

1855
01:24:23.16 --> 01:24:25.16
and they look kind of and think,

1856
01:24:25.16 --> 01:24:26.16
this is good, my an actually no on a fight.

1857
01:24:26.16 --> 01:24:27.16
Yeah.

1858
01:24:27.16 --> 01:24:28.16
And then that's what happens.

1859
01:24:28.16 --> 01:24:30.16
And by the way, when you do train all the time,

1860
01:24:30.16 --> 01:24:31.16
you do know how to fight.

1861
01:24:31.16 --> 01:24:32.16
And then it is matter of fact.

1862
01:24:32.16 --> 01:24:34.16
You're like, yeah, all of all fight you.

1863
01:24:34.16 --> 01:24:35.16
Yeah, hold on.

1864
01:24:35.16 --> 01:24:36.16
That's the best feeling.

1865
01:24:36.16 --> 01:24:36.16
Yeah.

1866
01:24:36.16 --> 01:24:38.16
It's it's it's a good feeling to know that you can handle yourself.

1867
01:24:38.16 --> 01:24:39.16
Now.

1868
01:24:39.16 --> 01:24:40.16
Okay.

1869
01:24:40.16 --> 01:24:42.16
So now this continues to escalate.

1870
01:24:42.16 --> 01:24:44.16
And, you know,

1871
01:24:44.16 --> 01:24:46.16
if you just try and keep your distance from people,

1872
01:24:46.16 --> 01:24:47.16
you don't want to let them get close.

1873
01:24:47.16 --> 01:24:48.16
You don't know they got a knife.

1874
01:24:48.16 --> 01:24:49.16
You don't know what kind of disease they are.

1875
01:24:49.16 --> 01:24:51.16
You just want to keep away from them.

1876
01:24:51.16 --> 01:24:52.16
Yeah.

1877
01:24:52.16 --> 01:24:54.16
But eventually you might not be able to back up anymore.

1878
01:24:54.16 --> 01:24:56.16
You might not be able to keep any distance.

1879
01:24:56.16 --> 01:24:58.16
Watch their hands.

1880
01:24:58.16 --> 01:25:00.16
Keep as much distance as you can.

1881
01:25:00.16 --> 01:25:04.16
Eventually you got to put your hands up and kind of a non-confrontational way to protect your face.

1882
01:25:04.16 --> 01:25:07.16
To protect those soccer punch that's coming.

1883
01:25:07.16 --> 01:25:12.16
You know, you put your hands up just in a non-confrontational way up and up around your head.

1884
01:25:12.16 --> 01:25:14.16
And continue to de-escalate.

1885
01:25:14.16 --> 01:25:15.16
Hey man, I'm out here.

1886
01:25:15.16 --> 01:25:16.16
Don't don't want every problems.

1887
01:25:16.16 --> 01:25:18.16
You know, I'm not looking for an issue.

1888
01:25:18.16 --> 01:25:20.16
I don't know what your issue is,

1889
01:25:20.16 --> 01:25:21.16
but I don't have any issue with you.

1890
01:25:21.16 --> 01:25:23.16
I'm just trying to head home for more.

1891
01:25:23.16 --> 01:25:24.16
You know, one of those things.

1892
01:25:24.16 --> 01:25:29.16
And finally, if you get to a point where you have no choice,

1893
01:25:29.16 --> 01:25:33.16
well, then you utilize the skills that you have.

1894
01:25:33.16 --> 01:25:35.16
You hit hard, hit fast, you know,

1895
01:25:35.16 --> 01:25:38.16
start hiding until the threat is neutralized.

1896
01:25:38.16 --> 01:25:39.16
And then you get away.

1897
01:25:39.16 --> 01:25:43.16
And that's, in order to be able to do that,

1898
01:25:43.16 --> 01:25:46.16
you know, go to step one, prepare.

1899
01:25:46.16 --> 01:25:47.16
Prepare.

1900
01:25:47.16 --> 01:25:49.16
Yeah, that some, you're a,

1901
01:25:49.16 --> 01:25:52.16
the 99% of situations will be avoided if you're just away.

1902
01:25:52.16 --> 01:25:53.16
Most important thing.

1903
01:25:53.16 --> 01:25:54.16
Most important thing.

1904
01:25:54.16 --> 01:25:56.16
That's the most important thing.

1905
01:25:56.16 --> 01:25:57.16
Yeah, that's a huge deal.

1906
01:25:57.16 --> 01:25:58.16
So true.

1907
01:25:58.16 --> 01:26:00.16
Yeah, we would much rather have you do that.

1908
01:26:00.16 --> 01:26:01.16
Because any of these situations,

1909
01:26:01.16 --> 01:26:02.16
I could go out.

1910
01:26:02.16 --> 01:26:04.16
I'm pretty well prepared for anything.

1911
01:26:04.16 --> 01:26:09.16
I could go out tonight and have some guy square off with me.

1912
01:26:09.16 --> 01:26:11.16
And as I'm getting ready to fight him,

1913
01:26:11.16 --> 01:26:14.16
his buddy cracks me in the head with a, with a bottle and kills me.

1914
01:26:14.16 --> 01:26:15.16
That could happen tonight.

1915
01:26:15.16 --> 01:26:16.16
Yeah.

1916
01:26:16.16 --> 01:26:18.16
You know, that could happen at a restaurant tonight.

1917
01:26:18.16 --> 01:26:19.16
That could happen.

1918
01:26:19.16 --> 01:26:20.16
Yeah.

1919
01:26:20.16 --> 01:26:21.16
So what am I going to try and do?

1920
01:26:21.16 --> 01:26:22.16
I'm trying to avoid it.

1921
01:26:22.16 --> 01:26:24.16
The minute you square off with somebody,

1922
01:26:24.16 --> 01:26:27.16
you're now, you're now a target for all his friends.

1923
01:26:27.16 --> 01:26:32.16
By the way, I've been in some bar fights where the idiot,

1924
01:26:32.16 --> 01:26:35.16
that is being belligerent,

1925
01:26:35.16 --> 01:26:40.16
doesn't have the common sense or doesn't have the sense that he's surrounded by,

1926
01:26:40.16 --> 01:26:42.16
you know, by my friends.

1927
01:26:42.16 --> 01:26:43.16
Yeah.

1928
01:26:43.16 --> 01:26:45.16
And you're just thinking, you don't even, you're doomed.

1929
01:26:45.16 --> 01:26:46.16
Yeah.

1930
01:26:46.16 --> 01:26:50.16
So luckily, the guys that I hang out with are pretty honorable people

1931
01:26:50.16 --> 01:26:53.16
that aren't just going to, you know, crush somebody's skull.

1932
01:26:53.16 --> 01:26:55.16
But you don't always get, that's no guarantee.

1933
01:26:55.16 --> 01:26:56.16
That's no guarantee.

1934
01:26:56.16 --> 01:26:59.16
There's murders every day in America.

1935
01:26:59.16 --> 01:27:00.16
Yeah.

1936
01:27:00.16 --> 01:27:01.16
And they're not planned all of them.

1937
01:27:01.16 --> 01:27:03.16
Sell them or they plan.

1938
01:27:03.16 --> 01:27:06.16
It's gonna face book.

1939
01:27:06.16 --> 01:27:09.16
I want to say, I think I was get confused with the name

1940
01:27:09.16 --> 01:27:11.16
because like a lot of people will be like,

1941
01:27:11.16 --> 01:27:15.16
hey, echoes, you know, and ask me questions in regards to this podcast.

1942
01:27:15.16 --> 01:27:18.16
So as opposed to the other podcast.

1943
01:27:18.16 --> 01:27:20.16
Oh, this podcast.

1944
01:27:20.16 --> 01:27:22.16
But I don't want to be like, okay, he asked me,

1945
01:27:22.16 --> 01:27:23.16
but no, it was really nice.

1946
01:27:23.16 --> 01:27:26.16
Anyway, so a guy asked me, like,

1947
01:27:26.16 --> 01:27:30.16
this scenario was used at a bar, part of your something.

1948
01:27:30.16 --> 01:27:33.16
And guys are being disrespectful to him and his wife,

1949
01:27:33.16 --> 01:27:35.16
or girlfriend or something.

1950
01:27:35.16 --> 01:27:37.16
And then he's like, I know the high road.

1951
01:27:37.16 --> 01:27:39.16
I know the right thing to do, quote unquote,

1952
01:27:39.16 --> 01:27:42.16
is to be done with it, you know,

1953
01:27:42.16 --> 01:27:43.16
to leave the situation.

1954
01:27:43.16 --> 01:27:47.16
But when you leave, you feel like a little, you know, like you was down.

1955
01:27:47.16 --> 01:27:49.16
That's really powerful feeling that you don't want.

1956
01:27:49.16 --> 01:27:51.16
So like, what do you do, man?

1957
01:27:51.16 --> 01:27:53.16
How do you just, how do you reconcile it?

1958
01:27:53.16 --> 01:27:55.16
Or should I fight or under certain circumstances?

1959
01:27:55.16 --> 01:27:57.16
Should I just fight for the honor kind of thing?

1960
01:27:57.16 --> 01:27:58.16
Like, what's the thing?

1961
01:27:58.16 --> 01:28:01.16
And so I've always really looked at it this way,

1962
01:28:01.16 --> 01:28:03.16
especially if you're kind of like,

1963
01:28:03.16 --> 01:28:06.16
if you have mental kind of control over the situation where you can be like,

1964
01:28:06.16 --> 01:28:08.16
okay, I'm gonna fight this guy or what?

1965
01:28:08.16 --> 01:28:10.16
So when you choose to engage,

1966
01:28:10.16 --> 01:28:12.16
you want to fight the guy, you're gonna say,

1967
01:28:12.16 --> 01:28:14.16
you know what, you said the wrong thing to me,

1968
01:28:14.16 --> 01:28:16.16
and I'm gonna square off her to my wife or whatever, you know?

1969
01:28:16.16 --> 01:28:18.16
So I'm gonna choose to square off.

1970
01:28:18.16 --> 01:28:20.16
Now all you, what you did use,

1971
01:28:20.16 --> 01:28:22.16
you took on all the potential results of that,

1972
01:28:22.16 --> 01:28:23.16
you took all that on.

1973
01:28:23.16 --> 01:28:25.16
Even if you win the fight, you get arrested,

1974
01:28:25.16 --> 01:28:27.16
like everything, as opposed to

1975
01:28:28.16 --> 01:28:30.16
taking on all the potential results,

1976
01:28:30.16 --> 01:28:32.16
probably, you know,

1977
01:28:32.16 --> 01:28:35.16
it would that come with not engaging,

1978
01:28:35.16 --> 01:28:37.16
which include going home safe,

1979
01:28:37.16 --> 01:28:39.16
your wife's safe, everybody's safe,

1980
01:28:39.16 --> 01:28:41.16
wake up tomorrow just like you with the other day,

1981
01:28:41.16 --> 01:28:44.16
and then compare that to jail.

1982
01:28:44.16 --> 01:28:46.16
I'm injured in some way.

1983
01:28:46.16 --> 01:28:48.16
I can't, you know,

1984
01:28:48.16 --> 01:28:50.16
I can function less tomorrow,

1985
01:28:50.16 --> 01:28:52.16
if I even make it on tomorrow, you know,

1986
01:28:52.16 --> 01:28:53.16
death, all this stuff.

1987
01:28:53.16 --> 01:28:56.16
When you kind of consider the outcomes that you want,

1988
01:28:56.16 --> 01:28:59.16
and the reason you're gonna make one decision over the other,

1989
01:28:59.16 --> 01:29:01.16
it kind of, it comes real clear,

1990
01:29:01.16 --> 01:29:03.16
even though at the time it's so powerful,

1991
01:29:03.16 --> 01:29:04.16
because you're like,

1992
01:29:04.16 --> 01:29:06.16
man, I don't want to waste out in front of everybody,

1993
01:29:06.16 --> 01:29:07.16
or my wife, you know,

1994
01:29:07.16 --> 01:29:08.16
my honor in front of my wife,

1995
01:29:08.16 --> 01:29:10.16
by your wife once you leave,

1996
01:29:10.16 --> 01:29:11.16
your wife doesn't want you to be like,

1997
01:29:11.16 --> 01:29:15.16
you know, my husband got bar fighting,

1998
01:29:15.16 --> 01:29:17.16
who, like, I'm so proud of him, you know,

1999
01:29:17.16 --> 01:29:19.16
you kids are like, I'm glad you're home, Dad.

2000
01:29:19.16 --> 01:29:20.16
Yeah, I'm glad you're not home, you know.

2001
01:29:20.16 --> 01:29:22.16
That's another thing that comes with,

2002
01:29:22.16 --> 01:29:24.16
I think with training all the time,

2003
01:29:24.16 --> 01:29:26.16
is we all know what we're going to stand.

2004
01:29:26.16 --> 01:29:27.16
Like, I mean,

2005
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:30.16
if there's a person that's going to beat me in a bar fight,

2006
01:29:30.16 --> 01:29:31.16
I know him.

2007
01:29:31.16 --> 01:29:33.16
Like, it's a famous fighter,

2008
01:29:33.16 --> 01:29:34.16
it's a famous Gigi Tuberat,

2009
01:29:34.16 --> 01:29:36.16
someone that is a known public figure

2010
01:29:36.16 --> 01:29:37.16
that is known for fighting,

2011
01:29:37.16 --> 01:29:38.16
that's like,

2012
01:29:38.16 --> 01:29:39.16
who's going to give,

2013
01:29:39.16 --> 01:29:40.16
if it's a civilian,

2014
01:29:40.16 --> 01:29:41.16
that doesn't train,

2015
01:29:41.16 --> 01:29:42.16
I mean, they don't,

2016
01:29:42.16 --> 01:29:44.16
they're not going to stand a chance.

2017
01:29:44.16 --> 01:29:46.16
Now if for the friends jump in,

2018
01:29:46.16 --> 01:29:47.16
of course, you're not some issues.

2019
01:29:47.16 --> 01:29:48.16
Well, but yes,

2020
01:29:48.16 --> 01:29:49.16
yes,

2021
01:29:49.16 --> 01:29:51.16
the best thing to do is avoid it.

2022
01:29:51.16 --> 01:29:53.16
But does your wife,

2023
01:29:53.16 --> 01:29:56.16
when your wife knows that you train every day,

2024
01:29:56.16 --> 01:29:58.16
that you get after it every day,

2025
01:29:58.16 --> 01:29:59.16
that you're physically fit,

2026
01:29:59.16 --> 01:30:00.16
physically strong,

2027
01:30:00.16 --> 01:30:03.16
and knows that you could destroy that person,

2028
01:30:03.16 --> 01:30:06.16
does she look down on you when you walk out of there?

2029
01:30:06.16 --> 01:30:07.16
No, she's like,

2030
01:30:07.16 --> 01:30:07.16
well,

2031
01:30:07.16 --> 01:30:09.16
I'm glad I married an actual man,

2032
01:30:09.16 --> 01:30:10.16
instead of an idiot.

2033
01:30:10.16 --> 01:30:11.16
Right.

2034
01:30:11.16 --> 01:30:12.16
And it's not,

2035
01:30:12.16 --> 01:30:13.16
that big of a deal,

2036
01:30:13.16 --> 01:30:13.16
like,

2037
01:30:13.16 --> 01:30:14.16
hey, bro,

2038
01:30:14.16 --> 01:30:15.16
if you want to fight here,

2039
01:30:15.16 --> 01:30:16.16
come to this gym,

2040
01:30:16.16 --> 01:30:17.16
I'll be there tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

2041
01:30:17.16 --> 01:30:18.16
Yeah, it's real good.

2042
01:30:18.16 --> 01:30:19.16
But I'm not going to fight out here,

2043
01:30:19.16 --> 01:30:20.16
I'm going to get arrested,

2044
01:30:20.16 --> 01:30:20.16
but you know,

2045
01:30:20.16 --> 01:30:23.16
or ensued by you after you're after I put you to sleep,

2046
01:30:23.16 --> 01:30:27.16
and then I make it so you can't use your arms anymore,

2047
01:30:27.16 --> 01:30:28.16
forever.

2048
01:30:28.16 --> 01:30:29.16
Yeah.

2049
01:30:29.16 --> 01:30:30.16
And even that,

2050
01:30:30.16 --> 01:30:30.16
I mean,

2051
01:30:30.16 --> 01:30:31.16
really looks really,

2052
01:30:31.16 --> 01:30:33.16
it made it even doing that.

2053
01:30:33.16 --> 01:30:34.16
Like, hey,

2054
01:30:34.16 --> 01:30:34.16
you want to fight,

2055
01:30:34.16 --> 01:30:35.16
I do want to fight you,

2056
01:30:35.16 --> 01:30:36.16
right?

2057
01:30:36.16 --> 01:30:37.16
But I, you know,

2058
01:30:37.16 --> 01:30:38.16
I'm a smart fighter,

2059
01:30:38.16 --> 01:30:39.16
right?

2060
01:30:39.16 --> 01:30:39.16
You know,

2061
01:30:39.16 --> 01:30:40.16
even that,

2062
01:30:40.16 --> 01:30:41.16
that's like,

2063
01:30:41.16 --> 01:30:42.16
that's kind of what's good.

2064
01:30:42.16 --> 01:30:42.16
Yeah,

2065
01:30:42.16 --> 01:30:43.16
Exactly.

2066
01:30:43.16 --> 01:30:44.16
As far as moves go,

2067
01:30:44.16 --> 01:30:45.16
although,

2068
01:30:45.16 --> 01:30:45.16
hey,

2069
01:30:45.16 --> 01:30:46.16
look,

2070
01:30:46.16 --> 01:30:49.16
if someone does that and post it on the internet or something like that,

2071
01:30:49.16 --> 01:30:49.16
or comes,

2072
01:30:49.16 --> 01:30:50.16
come on,

2073
01:30:50.16 --> 01:30:50.16
let's face it.

2074
01:30:50.16 --> 01:30:51.16
We all want to see that.

2075
01:30:51.16 --> 01:30:52.16
Oh,

2076
01:30:52.16 --> 01:30:53.16
part of us wants to see that.

2077
01:30:53.16 --> 01:30:54.16
Yeah,

2078
01:30:54.16 --> 01:30:55.16
we want to see the bully get beat up.

2079
01:30:55.16 --> 01:30:55.16
Yeah,

2080
01:30:55.16 --> 01:30:56.16
that's pretty common.

2081
01:30:56.16 --> 01:30:57.16
But really,

2082
01:30:57.16 --> 01:30:58.16
at the end of the day,

2083
01:30:58.16 --> 01:31:00.16
that's not the decision.

2084
01:31:00.16 --> 01:31:01.16
The decision isn't.

2085
01:31:01.16 --> 01:31:02.16
You're right.

2086
01:31:02.16 --> 01:31:03.16
Because it goes back,

2087
01:31:03.16 --> 01:31:04.16
what I said that earlier,

2088
01:31:04.16 --> 01:31:05.16
question,

2089
01:31:05.16 --> 01:31:07.16
if you're securing your manhood,

2090
01:31:07.16 --> 01:31:08.16
then it's not that big of a deal to go.

2091
01:31:08.16 --> 01:31:09.16
Dude,

2092
01:31:09.16 --> 01:31:10.16
you're drunk.

2093
01:31:10.16 --> 01:31:11.16
Carry on.

2094
01:31:11.16 --> 01:31:12.16
I'm out of here with my wife.

2095
01:31:12.16 --> 01:31:14.16
We're going to go back to a house and carry on with our lives,

2096
01:31:14.16 --> 01:31:15.16
like normal people.

2097
01:31:15.16 --> 01:31:18.16
You can find another person to get in a drunk fight with and end up in jail.

2098
01:31:18.16 --> 01:31:20.16
Let me ask you this.

2099
01:31:20.16 --> 01:31:21.16
You can be honest,

2100
01:31:21.16 --> 01:31:24.16
even as a full grown,

2101
01:31:24.16 --> 01:31:27.16
secure man.

2102
01:31:27.16 --> 01:31:30.16
If you found yourself in that scenario,

2103
01:31:30.16 --> 01:31:31.16
and you're like,

2104
01:31:31.16 --> 01:31:33.16
not me and my wife,

2105
01:31:33.16 --> 01:31:34.16
we're going to go home.

2106
01:31:34.16 --> 01:31:35.16
They're still a small party.

2107
01:31:35.16 --> 01:31:36.16
Of course.

2108
01:31:36.16 --> 01:31:37.16
Well,

2109
01:31:37.16 --> 01:31:37.16
well,

2110
01:31:37.16 --> 01:31:39.16
especially when you enjoy fighting.

2111
01:31:39.16 --> 01:31:40.16
Yeah.

2112
01:31:40.16 --> 01:31:41.16
You know what?

2113
01:31:41.16 --> 01:31:42.16
Yeah.

2114
01:31:42.16 --> 01:31:44.16
You know,

2115
01:31:44.16 --> 01:31:45.16
one of the guys at the gym,

2116
01:31:45.16 --> 01:31:46.16
who's,

2117
01:31:46.16 --> 01:31:47.16
um,

2118
01:31:47.16 --> 01:31:49.16
brown belt Mike,

2119
01:31:49.16 --> 01:31:50.16
you just didn't train much when you're there.

2120
01:31:50.16 --> 01:31:51.16
Anyways.

2121
01:31:51.16 --> 01:31:52.16
Mike.

2122
01:31:52.16 --> 01:31:53.16
Dude,

2123
01:31:53.16 --> 01:31:54.16
he usually goes in the morning.

2124
01:31:54.16 --> 01:31:55.16
Yeah.

2125
01:31:55.16 --> 01:31:56.16
He's usually there anyway.

2126
01:31:56.16 --> 01:31:57.16
Anyways,

2127
01:31:57.16 --> 01:31:59.16
he had somebody,

2128
01:31:59.16 --> 01:32:00.16
like say something to,

2129
01:32:00.16 --> 01:32:01.16
no,

2130
01:32:01.16 --> 01:32:02.16
somebody,

2131
01:32:02.16 --> 01:32:05.16
somebody like smacked his girlfriend's ass.

2132
01:32:05.16 --> 01:32:06.16
Like,

2133
01:32:06.16 --> 01:32:08.16
like he brought his girlfriend into the bar.

2134
01:32:08.16 --> 01:32:09.16
Yeah.

2135
01:32:09.16 --> 01:32:10.16
And he does more time.

2136
01:32:10.16 --> 01:32:11.16
Of course.

2137
01:32:11.16 --> 01:32:13.16
And he's a bad ass dude.

2138
01:32:13.16 --> 01:32:14.16
He walks in the bar.

2139
01:32:14.16 --> 01:32:16.16
And this guy just straight up,

2140
01:32:16.16 --> 01:32:18.16
just bam.

2141
01:32:18.16 --> 01:32:20.16
Slaps his girlfriend's ass.

2142
01:32:20.16 --> 01:32:22.16
And he like turned around.

2143
01:32:22.16 --> 01:32:23.16
Boom.

2144
01:32:23.16 --> 01:32:24.16
One, two,

2145
01:32:24.16 --> 01:32:25.16
to the head.

2146
01:32:25.16 --> 01:32:26.16
Drop the guy.

2147
01:32:26.16 --> 01:32:28.16
Need to the face out.

2148
01:32:28.16 --> 01:32:29.16
It was like,

2149
01:32:29.16 --> 01:32:29.16
yep,

2150
01:32:29.16 --> 01:32:30.16
boom.

2151
01:32:30.16 --> 01:32:31.16
Got arrested.

2152
01:32:31.16 --> 01:32:33.16
He paid $8,000 or something.

2153
01:32:33.16 --> 01:32:35.16
And did like 72 hours in jail.

2154
01:32:35.16 --> 01:32:37.16
I mean, it was legit.

2155
01:32:37.16 --> 01:32:38.16
Like,

2156
01:32:38.16 --> 01:32:39.16
and he talks about it.

2157
01:32:39.16 --> 01:32:40.16
I mean,

2158
01:32:40.16 --> 01:32:41.16
just to show you like a different,

2159
01:32:41.16 --> 01:32:42.16
and that's why,

2160
01:32:42.16 --> 01:32:43.16
like his attitude,

2161
01:32:43.16 --> 01:32:43.16
you know,

2162
01:32:43.16 --> 01:32:44.16
I talked about it.

2163
01:32:44.16 --> 01:32:44.16
He's like,

2164
01:32:44.16 --> 01:32:45.16
yeah,

2165
01:32:45.16 --> 01:32:45.16
you know,

2166
01:32:45.16 --> 01:32:46.16
the guy crossed the line and

2167
01:32:46.16 --> 01:32:47.16
then I had to pull him down.

2168
01:32:47.16 --> 01:32:47.16
Yeah.

2169
01:32:47.16 --> 01:32:48.16
And it was like,

2170
01:32:48.16 --> 01:32:48.16
yeah,

2171
01:32:48.16 --> 01:32:49.16
okay.

2172
01:32:49.16 --> 01:32:49.16
Yeah.

2173
01:32:49.16 --> 01:32:51.16
And that's an awesome story.

2174
01:32:51.16 --> 01:32:51.16
By the way,

2175
01:32:51.16 --> 01:32:53.16
it gives me like a for real.

2176
01:32:53.16 --> 01:32:53.16
Like,

2177
01:32:53.16 --> 01:32:54.16
Mike,

2178
01:32:54.16 --> 01:32:54.16
yeah,

2179
01:32:54.16 --> 01:32:54.16
the man.

2180
01:32:54.16 --> 01:32:55.16
Yeah.

2181
01:32:55.16 --> 01:32:55.16
But,

2182
01:32:55.16 --> 01:32:56.16
but let's face it though.

2183
01:32:56.16 --> 01:32:58.16
That wasn't the right move.

2184
01:32:58.16 --> 01:33:00.16
As far as before you do it.

2185
01:33:00.16 --> 01:33:01.16
Yeah.

2186
01:33:01.16 --> 01:33:01.16
I mean,

2187
01:33:01.16 --> 01:33:02.16
you're right.

2188
01:33:02.16 --> 01:33:03.16
I don't know what could have happened.

2189
01:33:03.16 --> 01:33:03.16
Yes.

2190
01:33:03.16 --> 01:33:05.16
We know what the actual outcome was.

2191
01:33:05.16 --> 01:33:07.16
And it was like $8,000.

2192
01:33:07.16 --> 01:33:09.16
And it's wife.

2193
01:33:09.16 --> 01:33:10.16
girlfriend.

2194
01:33:10.16 --> 01:33:11.16
girlfriend.

2195
01:33:11.16 --> 01:33:11.16
Okay.

2196
01:33:11.16 --> 01:33:12.16
Just a girlfriend.

2197
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:12.16
No, no,

2198
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:13.16
mess with bikes.

2199
01:33:13.16 --> 01:33:14.16
Girl, man.

2200
01:33:14.16 --> 01:33:14.16
Well,

2201
01:33:14.16 --> 01:33:15.16
I'm just saying if you have a wife,

2202
01:33:15.16 --> 01:33:16.16
and then I'm talking about it,

2203
01:33:16.16 --> 01:33:18.16
if you have like a kid's the $8,000.

2204
01:33:18.16 --> 01:33:20.16
So there's a series more detrimental.

2205
01:33:20.16 --> 01:33:21.16
Yeah, that's true.

2206
01:33:21.16 --> 01:33:22.16
Um,

2207
01:33:22.16 --> 01:33:23.16
but,

2208
01:33:23.16 --> 01:33:24.16
you know,

2209
01:33:24.16 --> 01:33:25.16
so I'm saying,

2210
01:33:25.16 --> 01:33:26.16
this is why you treat people with respect.

2211
01:33:26.16 --> 01:33:27.16
Yeah.

2212
01:33:27.16 --> 01:33:27.16
You know,

2213
01:33:27.16 --> 01:33:28.16
because otherwise,

2214
01:33:28.16 --> 01:33:29.16
you never know who you're messing with.

2215
01:33:29.16 --> 01:33:31.16
And Mike doesn't look like he's big intimidating.

2216
01:33:31.16 --> 01:33:32.16
Guy by the chance.

2217
01:33:32.16 --> 01:33:33.16
What does he weigh?

2218
01:33:33.16 --> 01:33:34.16
170.

2219
01:33:34.16 --> 01:33:35.16
I'm thinking of a different guy.

2220
01:33:35.16 --> 01:33:36.16
I realized it.

2221
01:33:36.16 --> 01:33:37.16
But what Mike's 170.

2222
01:33:37.16 --> 01:33:38.16
He's tough.

2223
01:33:38.16 --> 01:33:40.16
He's a tough bastard, too.

2224
01:33:40.16 --> 01:33:41.16
I mean,

2225
01:33:41.16 --> 01:33:42.16
on the mat.

2226
01:33:42.16 --> 01:33:43.16
He's tough.

2227
01:33:43.16 --> 01:33:45.16
But he's like 170.

2228
01:33:45.16 --> 01:33:46.16
And you know what?

2229
01:33:46.16 --> 01:33:47.16
He's a brown belt.

2230
01:33:47.16 --> 01:33:48.16
And you just do really good with a key.

2231
01:33:48.16 --> 01:33:49.16
Andy wrestled.

2232
01:33:49.16 --> 01:33:50.16
Like he wrestled.

2233
01:33:50.16 --> 01:33:51.16
So yeah.

2234
01:33:51.16 --> 01:33:52.16
And he's any train more time.

2235
01:33:52.16 --> 01:33:54.16
So he's just a tough dude.

2236
01:33:54.16 --> 01:33:54.16
Yeah.

2237
01:33:54.16 --> 01:33:57.16
And you don't know who you're messing with.

2238
01:33:57.16 --> 01:33:58.16
And boom.

2239
01:33:58.16 --> 01:34:00.16
But the interesting thing is.

2240
01:34:00.16 --> 01:34:01.16
And you know this.

2241
01:34:01.16 --> 01:34:02.16
I know this.

2242
01:34:02.16 --> 01:34:05.16
When you make eye contact with another person in a situation like that, you already know

2243
01:34:05.16 --> 01:34:06.16
if they train or not.

2244
01:34:06.16 --> 01:34:08.16
You're like, oh, this guy trains for sure.

2245
01:34:08.16 --> 01:34:09.16
I'm in for it.

2246
01:34:09.16 --> 01:34:10.16
You know, it's going to be it's going to be on.

2247
01:34:10.16 --> 01:34:11.16
Yeah.

2248
01:34:11.16 --> 01:34:13.16
That's awareness from the training.

2249
01:34:13.16 --> 01:34:14.16
Yeah.

2250
01:34:14.16 --> 01:34:16.16
But still.

2251
01:34:16.16 --> 01:34:17.16
Awesome story.

2252
01:34:17.16 --> 01:34:18.16
Don't do that.

2253
01:34:18.16 --> 01:34:19.16
Yeah.

2254
01:34:19.16 --> 01:34:20.16
Yeah.

2255
01:34:20.16 --> 01:34:21.16
I know.

2256
01:34:21.16 --> 01:34:22.16
Don't do it.

2257
01:34:22.16 --> 01:34:23.16
Mike.

2258
01:34:23.16 --> 01:34:24.16
Keep it up.

2259
01:34:24.16 --> 01:34:25.16
Just kidding.

2260
01:34:25.16 --> 01:34:26.16
Yeah.

2261
01:34:26.16 --> 01:34:27.16
Mike.

2262
01:34:27.16 --> 01:34:29.16
Don't mess with Mike's girl.

2263
01:34:29.16 --> 01:34:31.16
Jockel.

2264
01:34:31.16 --> 01:34:36.16
Were you very disciplined as a kid?

2265
01:34:36.16 --> 01:34:44.16
And was there a set day or moment when you saw how important discipline was and decided to do it?

2266
01:34:44.16 --> 01:34:53.16
Well, as a kid, I think I was for the most part a kid.

2267
01:34:53.16 --> 01:34:57.16
I was not so extremely disciplined kid.

2268
01:34:57.16 --> 01:35:04.16
I was pretty stubborn when it came to certain things, which may be some kind of an early

2269
01:35:04.16 --> 01:35:08.16
immature form of discipline, you know, just being hardheaded.

2270
01:35:08.16 --> 01:35:17.16
But I think as I got older, I saw the first thing I remember along these lines is seeing

2271
01:35:17.16 --> 01:35:18.16
a lack of discipline around me.

2272
01:35:18.16 --> 01:35:21.16
I didn't identify it as people having discipline.

2273
01:35:21.16 --> 01:35:22.16
I saw like a lack of discipline.

2274
01:35:22.16 --> 01:35:23.16
I saw weakness.

2275
01:35:23.16 --> 01:35:24.16
I saw drugs.

2276
01:35:24.16 --> 01:35:25.16
I saw alcohol.

2277
01:35:25.16 --> 01:35:26.16
I saw laziness.

2278
01:35:26.16 --> 01:35:32.16
And I started to get after it a little bit, right?

2279
01:35:32.16 --> 01:35:34.16
A little bit, a little tiny bit.

2280
01:35:34.16 --> 01:35:36.16
But there was no role models.

2281
01:35:36.16 --> 01:35:37.16
There was no internet.

2282
01:35:37.16 --> 01:35:39.16
There was no guidance.

2283
01:35:39.16 --> 01:35:47.16
I didn't have the sense to go to the library and find Bob Hoffman's book.

2284
01:35:47.16 --> 01:35:49.16
How to be healthy and strong?

2285
01:35:49.16 --> 01:35:50.16
Like I didn't know to do that.

2286
01:35:50.16 --> 01:35:51.16
I didn't have the sense to do that.

2287
01:35:51.16 --> 01:35:54.16
And so we did some basic things.

2288
01:35:54.16 --> 01:35:55.16
So you know what I mean?

2289
01:35:55.16 --> 01:35:57.16
Some push-ups.

2290
01:35:57.16 --> 01:35:58.16
You know?

2291
01:35:58.16 --> 01:36:03.16
And the push-up workouts that I did when I was 13 years old are laughable.

2292
01:36:03.16 --> 01:36:04.16
Laphable.

2293
01:36:04.16 --> 01:36:08.16
I mean, I think if I did, you know, a set of 50 push-ups.

2294
01:36:08.16 --> 01:36:11.16
I was cornered a boom on the man, right?

2295
01:36:11.16 --> 01:36:13.16
No, you are the man, 13.

2296
01:36:13.16 --> 01:36:14.16
Yeah.

2297
01:36:14.16 --> 01:36:15.16
50.

2298
01:36:15.16 --> 01:36:20.16
And we did some silly little kind of barbell, dumbbell, circuit training kind of thing.

2299
01:36:20.16 --> 01:36:23.16
Now I always like the military.

2300
01:36:23.16 --> 01:36:28.16
I recognize that as a, some kind of a trade of discipline in there.

2301
01:36:28.16 --> 01:36:32.16
And I looked up to military veterans.

2302
01:36:32.16 --> 01:36:37.16
I knew one Marine Corps drill instructor.

2303
01:36:37.16 --> 01:36:39.16
And if you know anything about Marine Corps drill instructors.

2304
01:36:39.16 --> 01:36:43.16
So now we're talking 85, 86, 87.

2305
01:36:43.16 --> 01:36:45.16
There wasn't any wars going on.

2306
01:36:45.16 --> 01:36:48.16
But you know, when you're a kid, you're just like, oh, he's a Marine Corps drill instructor.

2307
01:36:48.16 --> 01:36:50.16
He fit the part.

2308
01:36:50.16 --> 01:36:55.16
He was just perfect Marine Corps drill instructor, which most Marine Corps drill instructors are pretty damn perfect.

2309
01:36:55.16 --> 01:37:00.16
It's a incredibly incredibly honed job.

2310
01:37:00.16 --> 01:37:06.16
That's very well choreographed and very structured.

2311
01:37:06.16 --> 01:37:11.16
And it's a very fine real tight.

2312
01:37:11.16 --> 01:37:13.16
Real tight situation.

2313
01:37:13.16 --> 01:37:15.16
If you could mirror in court, drill instructor.

2314
01:37:15.16 --> 01:37:17.16
And I knew one, right, when I was a kid.

2315
01:37:17.16 --> 01:37:20.16
And I just like, he was like a god, right, this guy is a Marine Corps.

2316
01:37:20.16 --> 01:37:23.16
And of course he had, I think he had like a 68 commero.

2317
01:37:23.16 --> 01:37:27.16
So you know, he was just like, just the man.

2318
01:37:27.16 --> 01:37:30.16
And so now, so I got that going on.

2319
01:37:30.16 --> 01:37:34.16
And then then there was the hardcore bands that I started listening to.

2320
01:37:34.16 --> 01:37:40.16
And they seemed to have some kind of, there was something there, right?

2321
01:37:40.16 --> 01:37:42.16
I recognized something there.

2322
01:37:42.16 --> 01:37:44.16
I recognized something with black flag.

2323
01:37:44.16 --> 01:37:46.16
I recognized something with,

2324
01:37:46.16 --> 01:37:48.16
I've been called slap shot.

2325
01:37:48.16 --> 01:37:50.16
I recognized something with the crow mags.

2326
01:37:50.16 --> 01:37:53.16
And I saw there was something in there.

2327
01:37:53.16 --> 01:37:58.16
And I, I, I couldn't, I can't, I didn't know what it was,

2328
01:37:58.16 --> 01:38:01.16
but it was some kind of strength, right?

2329
01:38:01.16 --> 01:38:03.16
And some kind of discipline was in there.

2330
01:38:03.16 --> 01:38:07.16
I, I didn't put it all together though.

2331
01:38:07.16 --> 01:38:15.16
And there was no sort of unified way to go down this path.

2332
01:38:15.16 --> 01:38:19.16
It didn't, I didn't find that.

2333
01:38:19.16 --> 01:38:22.16
And I don't know if I found it, if it, what it would look like to me,

2334
01:38:22.16 --> 01:38:26.16
you know, maybe you could say that that path was the Boy Scouts, right?

2335
01:38:26.16 --> 01:38:31.16
The Boy Scouts are a disciplined group of individuals that learn how to hike and hunt.

2336
01:38:31.16 --> 01:38:33.16
I mean, so was that it?

2337
01:38:33.16 --> 01:38:38.16
I don't know, I maybe I didn't identify that or I didn't have the right personality.

2338
01:38:38.16 --> 01:38:41.16
Because I was kind of non-conformist, right?

2339
01:38:41.16 --> 01:38:45.16
I mean, it's a little bit, you know, a little bit of a rebel.

2340
01:38:45.16 --> 01:38:49.16
So I didn't put it all together.

2341
01:38:49.16 --> 01:38:53.16
And I had some little flashes of like being hardcore,

2342
01:38:53.16 --> 01:38:57.16
where some of the things I did that would be like, you know, kind of getting after it.

2343
01:38:57.16 --> 01:39:03.16
Some really minor ways, some some, some minimalistic level of discipline.

2344
01:39:03.16 --> 01:39:09.16
But it wasn't until I started training in earnest to join the Navy that I started to,

2345
01:39:09.16 --> 01:39:13.16
what we could recognize now as getting after it a little bit.

2346
01:39:13.16 --> 01:39:17.16
You know, it's an, and again, it's nothing compared to what people do now.

2347
01:39:17.16 --> 01:39:23.16
What definitely, you know, now we're talking 1989.

2348
01:39:23.16 --> 01:39:27.16
I was running through marshes and being covered in mud,

2349
01:39:27.16 --> 01:39:31.16
and I was swimming in the ocean, and I was doing pull-ups and push-ups and dips and sit-ups.

2350
01:39:31.16 --> 01:39:35.16
And again, it's nothing compared to what I do now,

2351
01:39:35.16 --> 01:39:37.16
or even what everybody does now.

2352
01:39:37.16 --> 01:39:41.16
But I was doing what I could with what I knew at the time.

2353
01:39:41.16 --> 01:39:47.16
And I didn't really have any idea of what I,

2354
01:39:47.16 --> 01:39:51.16
or really what people in general were capable of.

2355
01:39:51.16 --> 01:39:53.16
Like, I just didn't know.

2356
01:39:53.16 --> 01:39:55.16
I didn't know.

2357
01:39:55.16 --> 01:40:01.16
I never would have thought a good pull-up workout is 500,000 pull-ups.

2358
01:40:01.16 --> 01:40:05.16
I wouldn't have thought that. You know, for me, I did three sets of pull-ups.

2359
01:40:05.16 --> 01:40:07.16
And I was kind of the man, you know.

2360
01:40:07.16 --> 01:40:11.16
So I just, I just didn't, didn't know.

2361
01:40:11.16 --> 01:40:15.16
And I guess you could say I didn't even have,

2362
01:40:15.16 --> 01:40:19.16
I didn't know to even explore those,

2363
01:40:19.16 --> 01:40:23.16
those outer limits of what I was capable of, you know, which is a bummer.

2364
01:40:23.16 --> 01:40:29.16
Um, now, I don't see you got to remember.

2365
01:40:29.16 --> 01:40:33.16
I didn't even know another person that did pull-ups.

2366
01:40:33.16 --> 01:40:35.16
There wasn't like pull-up bars around.

2367
01:40:35.16 --> 01:40:39.16
There wasn't, you know, I'm out in the woods somewhere.

2368
01:40:39.16 --> 01:40:41.16
The woods in New England. There's no pull-ups.

2369
01:40:41.16 --> 01:40:43.16
People aren't like, hey, how many pull-ups can you?

2370
01:40:43.16 --> 01:40:45.16
I never heard that question.

2371
01:40:45.16 --> 01:40:49.16
And I didn't know what he would have slammed in the open ocean.

2372
01:40:49.16 --> 01:40:51.16
I didn't know what he would have did push-up workouts, right?

2373
01:40:51.16 --> 01:40:55.16
I don't know. I was just in the sticks.

2374
01:40:55.16 --> 01:40:57.16
And so when I joined the military,

2375
01:40:57.16 --> 01:41:01.16
I was a blank slate, really, for all practical purposes.

2376
01:41:01.16 --> 01:41:03.16
It was really easy. They say, you do this.

2377
01:41:03.16 --> 01:41:05.16
This is what you do. And you get advanced.

2378
01:41:05.16 --> 01:41:07.16
This is what you do to be ready. This is what you do.

2379
01:41:07.16 --> 01:41:13.16
And I realized very quickly that the harder you worked,

2380
01:41:13.16 --> 01:41:15.16
that the more disciplined you were,

2381
01:41:15.16 --> 01:41:19.16
the easier, your life was, the easier, your job was,

2382
01:41:19.16 --> 01:41:21.16
your day was, the easier physical activities would get.

2383
01:41:21.16 --> 01:41:23.16
And when I got into the teams,

2384
01:41:23.16 --> 01:41:25.16
and really going through buds,

2385
01:41:25.16 --> 01:41:29.16
when you're going through buds and when I finally met guys that were going to buds,

2386
01:41:29.16 --> 01:41:31.16
we started doing a hundred pull-ups.

2387
01:41:31.16 --> 01:41:33.16
And we started doing a hundred and fifty pull-ups.

2388
01:41:33.16 --> 01:41:35.16
We started doing two hundred pull-ups to work out.

2389
01:41:35.16 --> 01:41:37.16
And then it was like, oh wow, you can do a lot of stuff.

2390
01:41:37.16 --> 01:41:39.16
That was getting ready to go to buds, and you go to buds.

2391
01:41:39.16 --> 01:41:41.16
And you realize that people,

2392
01:41:41.16 --> 01:41:43.16
it's not this this individual, like,

2393
01:41:43.16 --> 01:41:45.16
spiritual awakening.

2394
01:41:45.16 --> 01:41:47.16
Like, no, you just realize, hey,

2395
01:41:47.16 --> 01:41:49.16
you can do a lot of pull-ups. People can't.

2396
01:41:49.16 --> 01:41:51.16
It's not that big of a deal. And everybody knows you can find that out.

2397
01:41:51.16 --> 01:41:53.16
And then you don't need to go to buds figure that out.

2398
01:41:53.16 --> 01:41:55.16
You can figure that out. Just, I'm telling you right now.

2399
01:41:55.16 --> 01:41:58.16
You know what I mean? And all you need is to have that knowledge.

2400
01:41:58.16 --> 01:42:01.16
But I continue to realize that being disciplined,

2401
01:42:01.16 --> 01:42:05.16
all these things waking up earlier and working hard and training hard

2402
01:42:05.16 --> 01:42:08.16
and keeping your gear squared away and studying the material that we were supposed to know.

2403
01:42:08.16 --> 01:42:17.16
I realize that that work, that discipline made life easier and it made us freer.

2404
01:42:17.16 --> 01:42:20.16
Made me freer.

2405
01:42:20.16 --> 01:42:24.16
And the more time I spent in the teams,

2406
01:42:24.16 --> 01:42:29.16
the more this came embedded in my head and not only as an individual

2407
01:42:29.16 --> 01:42:32.16
that I realized this, but I realized this very quickly.

2408
01:42:32.16 --> 01:42:35.16
We're not very quickly, but as soon as I started moving in leadership positions,

2409
01:42:35.16 --> 01:42:39.16
I realized that the more disciplined a squad was,

2410
01:42:39.16 --> 01:42:41.16
the more disciplined a little team was,

2411
01:42:41.16 --> 01:42:45.16
the better that squad or that particular was going to be.

2412
01:42:45.16 --> 01:42:52.16
And that's kind of where the evolution, the evolution of it.

2413
01:42:52.16 --> 01:43:03.16
Human, it's that whole process that I'm finally, I don't know if it's finally,

2414
01:43:03.16 --> 01:43:08.16
but right now it's starting to become clear where the whole, you know,

2415
01:43:08.16 --> 01:43:11.16
you're going to pay the price, you know,

2416
01:43:11.16 --> 01:43:14.16
at some point you're going to pay the price for your actions.

2417
01:43:14.16 --> 01:43:19.16
So if you're going to, like, let's say I'm going to get in shape,

2418
01:43:19.16 --> 01:43:23.16
you know,

2419
01:43:23.16 --> 01:43:26.16
you're committing to working out every day.

2420
01:43:26.16 --> 01:43:28.16
That's you paying a certain price.

2421
01:43:28.16 --> 01:43:31.16
Like this, having the discipline to do it, you're going to pay the price.

2422
01:43:31.16 --> 01:43:34.16
We can early, it's not comfortable working out every day,

2423
01:43:34.16 --> 01:43:35.16
it's not comfortable.

2424
01:43:35.16 --> 01:43:38.16
You're going to pay a little price right there.

2425
01:43:38.16 --> 01:43:40.16
The next day where the, you know,

2426
01:43:40.16 --> 01:43:42.16
in regards to the results of that workout,

2427
01:43:42.16 --> 01:43:45.16
you're not paying the price, you're reaping kind of rewards.

2428
01:43:45.16 --> 01:43:49.16
You can not pay the price early with the workout and stuff.

2429
01:43:49.16 --> 01:43:51.16
You still got to that tab to still outstanding.

2430
01:43:51.16 --> 01:43:55.16
So when you balance do, yeah, so when it comes results time,

2431
01:43:55.16 --> 01:43:59.16
there that's, that's when you're going to pay your little price there.

2432
01:43:59.16 --> 01:44:01.16
Your body, your health, whatever.

2433
01:44:01.16 --> 01:44:03.16
At some point you're going to have to pay the price.

2434
01:44:03.16 --> 01:44:05.16
Pay now or pay later.

2435
01:44:05.16 --> 01:44:07.16
Yeah, man. So I will pay now.

2436
01:44:07.16 --> 01:44:09.16
Pay now, you get way more benefit.

2437
01:44:09.16 --> 01:44:13.16
Because like no one remembers, well, we do.

2438
01:44:13.16 --> 01:44:18.16
We, I don't remember and take pleasure in remembering the time I skipped that workout.

2439
01:44:18.16 --> 01:44:21.16
Because I wasn't feeling like doing it, you know.

2440
01:44:21.16 --> 01:44:26.16
Like that doesn't provide a sense of pleasure in my life to think back on those days, you know.

2441
01:44:26.16 --> 01:44:27.16
Yeah, it's not good.

2442
01:44:27.16 --> 01:44:31.16
And at the same time when I think of like the detriment of doing the workout,

2443
01:44:31.16 --> 01:44:36.16
when I didn't feel like it, that doesn't, that's not a bad memory to me, you know.

2444
01:44:36.16 --> 01:44:39.16
When I do think back of like, and or think even now,

2445
01:44:39.16 --> 01:44:45.16
like the result of being in better shape than the average person or going to do just to not gasing or whatever.

2446
01:44:45.16 --> 01:44:48.16
Bringing in all the groceries at one time.

2447
01:44:48.16 --> 01:44:50.16
It's face it, that's something.

2448
01:44:50.16 --> 01:44:59.16
That is a sense of pleasure that I have the freedom to be able to do that when I want, you know.

2449
01:44:59.16 --> 01:45:00.16
Yeah.

2450
01:45:00.16 --> 01:45:04.16
And you know what else is interesting about this is sometimes I hear this.

2451
01:45:04.16 --> 01:45:07.16
And you did this a couple times tonight, right?

2452
01:45:07.16 --> 01:45:10.16
People go, well, yeah, but you're a dog.

2453
01:45:10.16 --> 01:45:15.16
Like as if I'm as if I'm not a normal person, but I'm not.

2454
01:45:15.16 --> 01:45:20.16
Yeah, but I'm saying like, you know, I just kind of went through like the story.

2455
01:45:20.16 --> 01:45:24.16
And it's pain's a pretty clear picture that I'm a pretty normal person.

2456
01:45:24.16 --> 01:45:25.16
Yeah.

2457
01:45:25.16 --> 01:45:25.16
Right.

2458
01:45:25.16 --> 01:45:26.16
Yeah.

2459
01:45:26.16 --> 01:45:27.16
It's pretty normal.

2460
01:45:27.16 --> 01:45:32.16
But I made decisions along the way that maybe weren't normal.

2461
01:45:32.16 --> 01:45:38.16
And that maybe opened the doors to being a little bit not normal.

2462
01:45:38.16 --> 01:45:39.16
Yeah.

2463
01:45:39.16 --> 01:45:41.16
But their choices that you can make.

2464
01:45:41.16 --> 01:45:44.16
So, so I'll have this with my kids too.

2465
01:45:44.16 --> 01:45:47.16
Or you know who else sometimes I'll have.

2466
01:45:47.16 --> 01:45:48.16
Them.

2467
01:45:48.16 --> 01:45:50.16
I would have friends.

2468
01:45:50.16 --> 01:45:51.16
We'll say.

2469
01:45:51.16 --> 01:45:52.16
Sure.

2470
01:45:52.16 --> 01:45:55.16
That would say, you know, well, yeah, that's you.

2471
01:45:55.16 --> 01:45:59.16
You know, like I said, no, if you want to win this fight, for instance, you want to win this fight.

2472
01:45:59.16 --> 01:46:02.16
You got to be going to do this. You got to get after this. You got.

2473
01:46:02.16 --> 01:46:04.16
Anyway, well, you know, it's not that easy.

2474
01:46:04.16 --> 01:46:07.16
And that's that's what you would do.

2475
01:46:07.16 --> 01:46:10.16
But you're you.

2476
01:46:10.16 --> 01:46:14.16
And that's, you know, it's almost like, yeah, it's unachievable.

2477
01:46:14.16 --> 01:46:15.16
Yeah, it doesn't apply to it.

2478
01:46:15.16 --> 01:46:17.16
And my kids will say that to me.

2479
01:46:17.16 --> 01:46:19.16
You know, my kids.

2480
01:46:19.16 --> 01:46:26.16
And I think it's actually a pretty big detriment that they think that I'm not that that.

2481
01:46:26.16 --> 01:46:30.16
Oh, I do it, but, but that's because I'm me.

2482
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:33.16
And I'm, no, it's not true.

2483
01:46:33.16 --> 01:46:34.16
It's not true.

2484
01:46:34.16 --> 01:46:41.16
And so, you know, occasionally I hear people say that and I go, man, this isn't like,

2485
01:46:41.16 --> 01:46:47.16
I guess it's kind of like what we were talking about the other day with someone saying,

2486
01:46:47.16 --> 01:46:49.16
Oh, oh, that's a good picture you took.

2487
01:46:49.16 --> 01:46:51.16
What kind of camera did you use?

2488
01:46:51.16 --> 01:46:52.16
Well, it's kind of like that.

2489
01:46:52.16 --> 01:46:55.16
I'm like, you know, oh, I wake up early.

2490
01:46:55.16 --> 01:46:59.16
It doesn't, it's not just because you just give it it.

2491
01:46:59.16 --> 01:47:00.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2492
01:47:00.16 --> 01:47:01.16
Or I work out a lot.

2493
01:47:01.16 --> 01:47:03.16
Oh, did, because you're super motivated.

2494
01:47:03.16 --> 01:47:04.16
Right.

2495
01:47:04.16 --> 01:47:05.16
I was gifted.

2496
01:47:05.16 --> 01:47:07.16
Yeah, I just, I just, I'm born motivated.

2497
01:47:07.16 --> 01:47:08.16
Right.

2498
01:47:08.16 --> 01:47:10.16
No, actually, I'm a person.

2499
01:47:10.16 --> 01:47:12.16
And I grew up, you know, a person.

2500
01:47:12.16 --> 01:47:13.16
Yeah.

2501
01:47:13.16 --> 01:47:19.16
And so, but it makes it very clear that these are just choices you can make and you can get

2502
01:47:19.16 --> 01:47:20.16
a half grit totally true.

2503
01:47:20.16 --> 01:47:24.16
And I would say that it does, when I say,

2504
01:47:24.16 --> 01:47:29.16
well, anytime I would say consciously, meaningfully say, well, that's you is if I would be talking

2505
01:47:29.16 --> 01:47:32.16
about a way of achieving like the same thing.

2506
01:47:32.16 --> 01:47:33.16
Like you would do it this way.

2507
01:47:33.16 --> 01:47:35.16
I would try to do it this way kind of thing.

2508
01:47:35.16 --> 01:47:39.16
If I was confidence that I could get the results, you know, whatever that is.

2509
01:47:39.16 --> 01:47:42.16
But, um, when did I say it to you about you sleeping?

2510
01:47:42.16 --> 01:47:47.16
Yeah, you can do the four hours sleeping thing or so more so then you can do the four hour sleep

2511
01:47:47.16 --> 01:47:48.16
and still function.

2512
01:47:48.16 --> 01:47:52.16
I meant you're into the four hours five hour sleep thing.

2513
01:47:52.16 --> 01:47:53.16
Yeah.

2514
01:47:53.16 --> 01:47:57.16
But, and I realize there are some genetic points in there.

2515
01:47:57.16 --> 01:47:58.16
I believe, right?

2516
01:47:58.16 --> 01:48:01.16
Yeah, I believe that there are some genetic points in there.

2517
01:48:01.16 --> 01:48:05.16
I believe there are some genetic points in everything, right?

2518
01:48:05.16 --> 01:48:12.16
And I've told you this, I have one of my daughters who is most similar to me, both physically

2519
01:48:12.16 --> 01:48:19.16
and mentally, sleeps about the same as I do if not less.

2520
01:48:19.16 --> 01:48:20.16
Yeah.

2521
01:48:20.16 --> 01:48:27.16
I believe that there are some of my other daughters who is most physically and mentally, well,

2522
01:48:27.16 --> 01:48:30.16
physically more like my wife.

2523
01:48:30.16 --> 01:48:32.16
She sleeps a lot.

2524
01:48:32.16 --> 01:48:33.16
Yeah.

2525
01:48:33.16 --> 01:48:37.16
And so there is a, and my wife sleeps more than I do.

2526
01:48:37.16 --> 01:48:40.16
And so there is a genetic component to it.

2527
01:48:40.16 --> 01:48:43.16
I believe in our red articles and people send me you Twitter articles all the time.

2528
01:48:43.16 --> 01:48:47.16
Oh, you're one of these, you know, fast sleepers that 2% of the population all the

2529
01:48:47.16 --> 01:48:48.16
stuff.

2530
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:51.16
And I'm just saying, okay, yeah, that's great.

2531
01:48:51.16 --> 01:48:55.16
But then people say, oh, well, you just work out every day because you're super motivated.

2532
01:48:55.16 --> 01:49:00.16
And then that's your, or you just change your jits all the time because you're just super motivated.

2533
01:49:00.16 --> 01:49:02.16
And it's like, okay, yeah.

2534
01:49:02.16 --> 01:49:03.16
Well, you don't want great.

2535
01:49:03.16 --> 01:49:04.16
Great.

2536
01:49:04.16 --> 01:49:05.16
Yeah.

2537
01:49:05.16 --> 01:49:05.16
Yeah.

2538
01:49:05.16 --> 01:49:06.16
I think you're absolutely correct.

2539
01:49:06.16 --> 01:49:12.16
And even with the sleeping thing, that is like because, okay, ultimately,

2540
01:49:12.16 --> 01:49:16.16
you don't have to sleep as much as the next person sure that's an advantage just because you have more

2541
01:49:16.16 --> 01:49:17.16
time, more time.

2542
01:49:17.16 --> 01:49:18.16
That's it.

2543
01:49:18.16 --> 01:49:23.16
It's not like, you know, someone would be like, hey, other than that reason be like, hey, it's cooler,

2544
01:49:23.16 --> 01:49:28.16
or it's somehow more beneficial for me to sleep five hours rather than my normal eight.

2545
01:49:28.16 --> 01:49:31.16
Like, so, I mean, that, put it this way.

2546
01:49:31.16 --> 01:49:36.16
Someone wants to choose to sleep four hours just because you do it.

2547
01:49:36.16 --> 01:49:37.16
That's kind of weird.

2548
01:49:37.16 --> 01:49:38.16
Yeah.

2549
01:49:38.16 --> 01:49:45.16
Now that being said, what's awesome is there are a bunch of people on the interwebs.

2550
01:49:45.16 --> 01:49:53.16
A bunch of badass troopers that have, our, I retweet almost all of these because people go,

2551
01:49:53.16 --> 01:49:57.16
hey, you know, I'm, I lost 32 pounds.

2552
01:49:57.16 --> 01:50:00.16
Hey, I lost 42 pounds.

2553
01:50:00.16 --> 01:50:06.16
Hey, I, you know, did my first squat today with 300 pounds.

2554
01:50:06.16 --> 01:50:11.16
And there's no difference in what they were doing before and what they're doing now fundamentally

2555
01:50:11.16 --> 01:50:17.16
in their, in their jeans or their, or their physiology, what they did is they decided to make

2556
01:50:17.16 --> 01:50:18.16
these decisions.

2557
01:50:18.16 --> 01:50:20.16
They decided that they were going to go out.

2558
01:50:20.16 --> 01:50:21.16
They decided they were going to step up their game.

2559
01:50:21.16 --> 01:50:23.16
They're going to decide they're going to wake up early.

2560
01:50:23.16 --> 01:50:24.16
They decided they're going to clean up their diet.

2561
01:50:24.16 --> 01:50:26.16
They decided they were going to get after it.

2562
01:50:26.16 --> 01:50:28.16
And when they do that, all of a sudden boom.

2563
01:50:28.16 --> 01:50:32.16
And you know what, you fast forward like six months and people will go, well, you

2564
01:50:32.16 --> 01:50:34.16
just do that because you're super motivated.

2565
01:50:34.16 --> 01:50:37.16
And they'll be, they'll be thinking, you know, no, I'm not.

2566
01:50:37.16 --> 01:50:38.16
I'm, I'm a person.

2567
01:50:38.16 --> 01:50:42.16
You know, and I choose to get after it.

2568
01:50:42.16 --> 01:50:46.16
You know, recommend you all choose to get after it.

2569
01:50:46.16 --> 01:50:47.16
And I encourage that.

2570
01:50:47.16 --> 01:50:49.16
And you know what, it's not easy.

2571
01:50:49.16 --> 01:50:51.16
It's not easy.

2572
01:50:51.16 --> 01:50:57.16
There's the nagging weakness that is pulling you down.

2573
01:50:57.16 --> 01:50:59.16
You know, you got a shot.

2574
01:50:59.16 --> 01:51:03.16
You're thinking, let's talk to my friend Anthony about this yesterday.

2575
01:51:03.16 --> 01:51:05.16
And I always mentioned this.

2576
01:51:05.16 --> 01:51:11.16
So decision making, right, we're wired this environment right now.

2577
01:51:11.16 --> 01:51:14.16
We're wired to not get after it, you know, brain.

2578
01:51:14.16 --> 01:51:17.16
We're wired for the short term payoff right now.

2579
01:51:17.16 --> 01:51:20.16
In times of scarcity, you know, I don't know if I'm into that.

2580
01:51:20.16 --> 01:51:23.16
But you're wired to you better get it while you can.

2581
01:51:23.16 --> 01:51:26.16
Food may rest.

2582
01:51:26.16 --> 01:51:29.16
Rett everything you better get it when you when you and your body

2583
01:51:29.16 --> 01:51:32.16
starts to adapt to that environment because it's been going on for so long.

2584
01:51:32.16 --> 01:51:34.16
So it's like, man, if you're tired, that's your body.

2585
01:51:34.16 --> 01:51:37.16
Telling you something, you got to get that rest.

2586
01:51:37.16 --> 01:51:40.16
You see some food, some fat, a lot of calories.

2587
01:51:40.16 --> 01:51:43.16
You know, fat sugar, a lot of energy.

2588
01:51:43.16 --> 01:51:44.16
You better get that.

2589
01:51:44.16 --> 01:51:45.16
You better eat it now.

2590
01:51:45.16 --> 01:51:46.16
Now physiologically.

2591
01:51:46.16 --> 01:51:47.16
You're like that.

2592
01:51:47.16 --> 01:51:48.16
And mentally, you're like that.

2593
01:51:48.16 --> 01:51:49.16
You're wired that way.

2594
01:51:49.16 --> 01:51:52.16
So my point.

2595
01:51:52.16 --> 01:51:55.16
I probably like discounting.

2596
01:51:55.16 --> 01:52:00.16
All that is is choosing the short term payoff over the long term payoff.

2597
01:52:00.16 --> 01:52:05.16
Oftentimes when the long term comes, you regret your short term payoff decision.

2598
01:52:05.16 --> 01:52:06.16
Most of the time.

2599
01:52:06.16 --> 01:52:07.16
Right.

2600
01:52:07.16 --> 01:52:08.16
Yeah.

2601
01:52:08.16 --> 01:52:09.16
So it's a spectrum.

2602
01:52:09.16 --> 01:52:12.16
You know, there's some, some things are more or less detrimental.

2603
01:52:12.16 --> 01:52:17.16
So discounting is when you choose that short term payoff.

2604
01:52:17.16 --> 01:52:21.16
You can trace back all your success in failures

2605
01:52:21.16 --> 01:52:27.16
to making that short term payoff decision over the long term payoff.

2606
01:52:27.16 --> 01:52:30.16
But here's the thing, here's my point.

2607
01:52:30.16 --> 01:52:31.16
It's rather odd.

2608
01:52:31.16 --> 01:52:33.16
You say it's not easy.

2609
01:52:33.16 --> 01:52:34.16
This is the fact.

2610
01:52:34.16 --> 01:52:35.16
It's not easy because you're not.

2611
01:52:35.16 --> 01:52:36.16
Why you have to learn.

2612
01:52:36.16 --> 01:52:38.16
You have to be trained out of discounting.

2613
01:52:38.16 --> 01:52:39.16
I've probably discounted.

2614
01:52:39.16 --> 01:52:40.16
You got to be trained out of it.

2615
01:52:40.16 --> 01:52:45.16
And one way or another, whether it's firm from somebody, from your environment, you're in.

2616
01:52:45.16 --> 01:52:52.16
You know, like if everyone's, if everyone's eating healthy around you, it's very unlikely that you're going to be like,

2617
01:52:52.16 --> 01:52:53.16
Oh, this is how you do it.

2618
01:52:53.16 --> 01:52:54.16
Okay.

2619
01:52:54.16 --> 01:52:55.16
I'm going to not do it.

2620
01:52:55.16 --> 01:52:56.16
I'm really unlikely.

2621
01:52:56.16 --> 01:53:03.16
So you can get trained by that way, but the point is you get, you have to be trained out of this way of thinking because you're wired for it.

2622
01:53:03.16 --> 01:53:07.16
And all it is is the short term payoff versus the long term payoff.

2623
01:53:07.16 --> 01:53:09.16
Like I said, you got to pay that price somewhere.

2624
01:53:09.16 --> 01:53:15.16
You might as well pay the price short term now and get the benefits for the long term.

2625
01:53:15.16 --> 01:53:16.16
You know, rather than discounting.

2626
01:53:16.16 --> 01:53:17.16
But we're wired against it.

2627
01:53:17.16 --> 01:53:19.16
So that's why it's not easy.

2628
01:53:19.16 --> 01:53:20.16
But it train yourself out of it, man.

2629
01:53:20.16 --> 01:53:22.16
You know how you train yourself out of it.

2630
01:53:22.16 --> 01:53:24.16
Do it yourself and get after it.

2631
01:53:24.16 --> 01:53:25.16
Get after it.

2632
01:53:25.16 --> 01:53:26.16
All right.

2633
01:53:26.16 --> 01:53:27.16
It's true though.

2634
01:53:27.16 --> 01:53:28.16
It's absolutely true.

2635
01:53:28.16 --> 01:53:30.16
Speaking of instinct.

2636
01:53:30.16 --> 01:53:39.16
Is it possible to train instinct and can we trust it wholly in fighting and in leadership?

2637
01:53:39.16 --> 01:53:50.16
Well, the first one, instinct is, is it's like a voice and it's a voice that you can listen to and it's a voice that you should listen to.

2638
01:53:50.16 --> 01:53:54.16
And you have to get to know your instincts, right? You have to get to know him.

2639
01:53:54.16 --> 01:54:00.16
You have to know how accurate they are and which ones you should listen to and which ones you shouldn't listen to.

2640
01:54:00.16 --> 01:54:02.16
And it's real.

2641
01:54:02.16 --> 01:54:08.16
Like with fighting, it's very obvious with fighting you train to a point that your instinct knows what to do.

2642
01:54:08.16 --> 01:54:15.16
So if someone gets in digging for an underhook on you, you swim to defend that underhook.

2643
01:54:15.16 --> 01:54:18.16
If someone gets the underhook boom, you put on the wizard, right?

2644
01:54:18.16 --> 01:54:24.16
Those are just instincts and it's good and it's good to have those instincts.

2645
01:54:24.16 --> 01:54:26.16
That's perfect.

2646
01:54:26.16 --> 01:54:33.16
Now, sometimes even in fighting your instincts are actually wrong.

2647
01:54:33.16 --> 01:54:39.16
And I'll give you a very good example of this is rolling with a guy by the name of James.

2648
01:54:39.16 --> 01:54:41.16
Nealson, you've been rolling the James before?

2649
01:54:41.16 --> 01:54:42.16
Many, many, many.

2650
01:54:42.16 --> 01:54:45.16
So James, black belt's been trained in forever.

2651
01:54:45.16 --> 01:54:51.16
He's got a different jujitsu, a different jujitsu, weird jujitsu.

2652
01:54:51.16 --> 01:54:53.16
It's weird. It's different.

2653
01:54:53.16 --> 01:55:02.16
And the thing that you have to remember when you're rolling with James is that your instincts are likely wrong.

2654
01:55:02.16 --> 01:55:06.16
It's crazy, but your instincts are likely wrong.

2655
01:55:06.16 --> 01:55:10.16
And I know that it's a blanket statement and it's actually true.

2656
01:55:10.16 --> 01:55:15.16
For instance, he wants you to pass garden get across side.

2657
01:55:15.16 --> 01:55:19.16
He wants you across side, which is crazy in jujitsu.

2658
01:55:19.16 --> 01:55:26.16
So your instinct to get past his garden, get across side and dig in deep with your head control on him and having his arm.

2659
01:55:26.16 --> 01:55:32.16
That's what he wants you to do because he has a whole series of moves that he does from there.

2660
01:55:32.16 --> 01:55:38.16
Now, much like we were talking earlier about a long, lengthy guy that does moves that no one's used to.

2661
01:55:38.16 --> 01:55:41.16
James does moves that people are not used to.

2662
01:55:41.16 --> 01:55:46.16
And the moves that he does capitalize on your instinct.

2663
01:55:46.16 --> 01:55:53.16
So for instance, when you trap his head from a cross side and you want to put your arm there and you put it there, that's your instinct.

2664
01:55:53.16 --> 01:55:56.16
He wants you to put his arm there because he's going to get a hold of it.

2665
01:55:56.16 --> 01:55:59.16
Trap it and he's got a sweep or a normal. He's going to set up from there.

2666
01:55:59.16 --> 01:56:02.16
So that's the thing.

2667
01:56:02.16 --> 01:56:12.16
You have to recognize and you have you can't just blank it, obey your instincts all the time because sometimes your instincts are going to be wrong.

2668
01:56:12.16 --> 01:56:14.16
That's the way it is.

2669
01:56:14.16 --> 01:56:19.16
And it is definitely the same thing in leadership.

2670
01:56:19.16 --> 01:56:29.16
And when using instincts in leadership, the first thing that you kind of have to do is you have to become aware of your instincts.

2671
01:56:29.16 --> 01:56:35.16
You have to pay attention to them and pay attention to what you're thinking and paying attention to what your instinct is and note your instinct.

2672
01:56:35.16 --> 01:56:42.16
And then look at the after the post-mortem and see if your instinct was correct or incorrect.

2673
01:56:42.16 --> 01:56:50.16
And then you've got to see how often you are right with your instinct and how often your instincts were wrong or what your natural biases are for instance.

2674
01:56:50.16 --> 01:56:54.16
You've got some people that are there instinct is too positive.

2675
01:56:54.16 --> 01:57:00.16
Right? Oh, you know, we'll be able to get this done and how often are you right about getting it done.

2676
01:57:00.16 --> 01:57:02.16
And then you've got some people out of two negative.

2677
01:57:02.16 --> 01:57:03.16
They're instinctive.

2678
01:57:03.16 --> 01:57:03.16
They're instinctive.

2679
01:57:03.16 --> 01:57:05.16
We'll never be able to get this done.

2680
01:57:05.16 --> 01:57:06.16
We shouldn't even go.

2681
01:57:06.16 --> 01:57:08.16
No, maybe you're wrong there.

2682
01:57:08.16 --> 01:57:11.16
There's some people instinctively.

2683
01:57:11.16 --> 01:57:13.16
They trust people too much.

2684
01:57:13.16 --> 01:57:15.16
They go, oh, echo.

2685
01:57:15.16 --> 01:57:17.16
I know he's going to handle what I'm just going to give him the project.

2686
01:57:17.16 --> 01:57:18.16
He's going to run with it.

2687
01:57:18.16 --> 01:57:19.16
He's got it.

2688
01:57:19.16 --> 01:57:24.16
And there's some people that instinctively don't trust enough and they go, man, I'm not going to echo.

2689
01:57:24.16 --> 01:57:25.16
So I can be able to handle this.

2690
01:57:25.16 --> 01:57:27.16
I got a micromanage.

2691
01:57:27.16 --> 01:57:39.16
And so those those two are examples of learning what your personal instinctive biases are so that you can calibrate them correctly.

2692
01:57:39.16 --> 01:57:46.16
And that way you can adjust your biases and you can mitigate their impact.

2693
01:57:46.16 --> 01:57:55.16
And you can utilize them and give credence to them and understand them and utilize them to the best of your ability.

2694
01:57:55.16 --> 01:58:09.16
And both leadership and fighting both of them as the more you do and the more you pay attention to your instincts, the better they're going to both become.

2695
01:58:09.16 --> 01:58:19.16
Now, that being said, there's another kind of instinct that you need to be on the lookout for.

2696
01:58:19.16 --> 01:58:22.16
And this one is a liar.

2697
01:58:22.16 --> 01:58:25.16
This one is a saboteur.

2698
01:58:25.16 --> 01:58:30.16
Well, this one is a backbiter.

2699
01:58:30.16 --> 01:58:35.16
And like the devil himself, he's a shape shifter.

2700
01:58:35.16 --> 01:58:44.16
He's going to disguise himself and make you think he's got your best interest in mind.

2701
01:58:44.16 --> 01:58:47.16
But he doesn't.

2702
01:58:47.16 --> 01:58:53.16
This is the instinct that says you've had enough.

2703
01:58:53.16 --> 01:58:57.16
This is the instinct that says you've given it your best shot.

2704
01:58:57.16 --> 01:59:00.16
You can you can stand down.

2705
01:59:00.16 --> 01:59:02.16
You can back off.

2706
01:59:02.16 --> 01:59:07.16
You can take a knee.

2707
01:59:07.16 --> 01:59:16.16
This is the instinct that says you can rest now.

2708
01:59:16.16 --> 01:59:18.16
Do not listen to that instinct.

2709
01:59:18.16 --> 01:59:22.16
Do not listen.

2710
01:59:22.16 --> 01:59:27.16
That instinct is a liar and wants to bring you down.

2711
01:59:27.16 --> 01:59:31.16
That's the instinct that's a defense mechanism.

2712
01:59:31.16 --> 01:59:36.16
You want to give you an out, a place to run to.

2713
01:59:36.16 --> 01:59:39.16
A little place to sympathy.

2714
01:59:39.16 --> 01:59:44.16
An amnesty, a little place of amnesty where everything is forgiven.

2715
01:59:44.16 --> 01:59:57.16
We're all these failures can gather together and comfort and drown their sorrows in lies and in deception.

2716
01:59:57.16 --> 02:00:02.16
And they tell each other,

2717
02:00:02.16 --> 02:00:07.16
and they'll tell you you did the best you could.

2718
02:00:07.16 --> 02:00:13.16
No, they'll say the deck, the deck was stacked against you.

2719
02:00:13.16 --> 02:00:19.16
And they'll say it's not your fault.

2720
02:00:19.16 --> 02:00:24.16
And they'll tell you it's okay to stop.

2721
02:00:24.16 --> 02:00:27.16
It's okay to settle.

2722
02:00:27.16 --> 02:00:33.16
It's okay to give up.

2723
02:00:33.16 --> 02:00:36.16
And that is the instinct you need to fight.

2724
02:00:36.16 --> 02:00:41.16
You need to push back to smash into the ground.

2725
02:00:41.16 --> 02:00:45.16
Do not take the easy way out.

2726
02:00:45.16 --> 02:00:49.16
Do not give up based on instinct.

2727
02:00:49.16 --> 02:00:58.16
If you are forced to stand down to retreat so that you can rebuild and reattach,

2728
02:00:58.16 --> 02:01:01.16
so be it.

2729
02:01:01.16 --> 02:01:07.16
But make that decision based on logic.

2730
02:01:07.16 --> 02:01:15.16
Not on the instinct of surrender and defeat.

2731
02:01:15.16 --> 02:01:21.16
And you need to train that instinct.

2732
02:01:21.16 --> 02:01:23.16
Your instinct.

2733
02:01:23.16 --> 02:01:26.16
Train it to say, get up.

2734
02:01:26.16 --> 02:01:29.16
Go, fight on.

2735
02:01:31.16 --> 02:01:35.16
And if that is what you become.

2736
02:01:35.16 --> 02:01:40.16
If that becomes your fundamental reaction to adversity.

2737
02:01:40.16 --> 02:01:44.16
If that becomes your gut instinct.

2738
02:01:44.16 --> 02:02:00.16
Then you will overcome just about anything that stands in your path.

2739
02:02:00.16 --> 02:02:10.16
And I think that's about all I've got for the night.

2740
02:02:10.16 --> 02:02:22.16
So thanks to all of you for listening to this podcast and for supporting the podcast.

2741
02:02:22.16 --> 02:02:29.16
Then now Echo is going to tell you how to do that in the most efficient way.

2742
02:02:29.16 --> 02:02:32.16
Yes, the most efficient way.

2743
02:02:32.16 --> 02:02:34.16
We'll start with an efficient way.

2744
02:02:34.16 --> 02:02:35.16
We'll say that.

2745
02:02:35.16 --> 02:02:36.16
Anyway.

2746
02:02:36.16 --> 02:02:38.16

02:02:49.16 --> 02:02:50.16
Yeah.

2754
02:02:50.16 --> 02:02:52.16
And by the way.

2755
02:02:52.16 --> 02:02:54.16
It may seem small.

2756
02:02:54.16 --> 02:02:56.16
We get a little tiny percentage.

2757
02:02:56.16 --> 02:02:58.16
But it is true.

2758
02:02:58.16 --> 02:03:02.16
We add all those little small percentages together.

2759
02:03:02.16 --> 02:03:05.16
It provides us with something to help us out with the podcast.

2760
02:03:05.16 --> 02:03:09.16
It's very supportive.

2761
02:03:09.16 --> 02:03:11.16
So it's very supportive.

2762
02:03:11.16 --> 02:03:13.16
It may not seem like a big deal.

2763
02:03:13.16 --> 02:03:15.16
But as a group.

2764
02:03:15.16 --> 02:03:17.16
It's very supportive and it's very helpful.

2765
02:03:17.16 --> 02:03:20.16
And you don't feel like you're not doing anything.

2766
02:03:20.16 --> 02:03:22.16

02:03:22.16 --> 02:03:23.16
Yep.

02:03:23.16 --> 02:03:24.16
Agreed.

2769
02:03:24.16 --> 02:03:25.16
And that is yeah.

2770
02:03:25.16 --> 02:03:27.16
Factsually true.

2771
02:03:27.16 --> 02:03:29.16
I think to help you with that.

2772
02:03:29.16 --> 02:03:31.16
Kind of make it even more.

I guess more official.

2774
02:03:32.16 --> 02:03:34.16
It's a cool little way.

2775
02:03:34.16 --> 02:03:35.16

Supports.

2788

The podcast.

2789
02:03:48.16 --> 02:03:49.16
When you shop through Amazon.

2790
02:03:49.16 --> 02:03:51.16
So you don't even have to remember to click through the website.

2791
02:03:51.16 --> 02:03:52.16
You don't have to go to the website anymore.

2792
02:03:52.16 --> 02:03:53.16
After that.

2793
02:03:53.16 --> 02:03:55.16

It's pretty cool.

2796
02:03:57.16 --> 02:03:58.16

02:04:01.16 --> 02:04:02.16
Helps.

2800
02:04:02.16 --> 02:04:04.16
Very much.

2801
02:04:04.16 --> 02:04:07.16
And then of course you got to support yourself.

2802
02:04:07.16 --> 02:04:17.16
I think some good supplements, which is saying a lot because there's, you know, there's a lot of not good supplements up there.

2803
02:04:17.16 --> 02:04:18.16
On it supplements.

2804
02:04:18.16 --> 02:04:19.16
The best.

2805
02:04:19.16 --> 02:04:22.16
It's like it's not even really a debate anymore.

2806
02:04:22.16 --> 02:04:23.16
Really?

2807
02:04:23.16 --> 02:04:24.16
No.

2808
02:04:24.16 --> 02:04:25.16
I don't want to pick it up.

2809
02:04:25.16 --> 02:04:26.16
I think.

2810
02:04:26.16 --> 02:04:27.16
Given like what we're trying to do.

2811
02:04:27.16 --> 02:04:28.16
What all of us are trying to do here.

2812
02:04:28.16 --> 02:04:29.16
If you're in the game.

2813
02:04:29.16 --> 02:04:30.16
There's no real.

2814
02:04:30.16 --> 02:04:31.16
Yeah.

02:04:31.16 --> 02:04:34.16

02:04:34.16 --> 02:04:38.16
Power gainor 5000 chocolate protein.

2817
02:04:38.16 --> 02:04:40.16
Tub of powder.

2818
02:04:40.16 --> 02:04:41.16
It's not that.

2819
02:04:41.16 --> 02:04:42.16
It's like legit supplements.

2820
02:04:42.16 --> 02:04:45.16

02:04:47.16 --> 02:04:48.16
By the way.

2823
02:04:48.16 --> 02:04:50.16
Krill oil, the best quality.

2834
02:05:04.16 --> 02:05:06.16
Highly recommend it.

2835
02:05:06.16 --> 02:05:09.16
I told a story last time about the, about the krill oil.

2836
02:05:09.16 --> 02:05:11.16
In joints, about my protein.

2837
02:05:11.16 --> 02:05:12.16
But I'm telling you the krill oil.

Even if you don't even realize it.

2839
02:05:14.16 --> 02:05:15.16

02:05:15.16 --> 02:05:18.16
But when after a while when you take your like man, it's, yeah.

2841

It's good.

2843
02:05:20.16 --> 02:05:21.16

2844
02:05:21.16 --> 02:05:22.16

2845
02:05:22.16 --> 02:05:23.16
Shroom tech for, yeah.

2846
02:05:23.16 --> 02:05:26.16
If you're getting after it high intensity stuff for, you know,

2847
02:05:26.16 --> 02:05:27.16
you need kind of prolonged period.

2848

That's going to help you.

2849
02:05:28.16 --> 02:05:29.16
Notably.

2850
02:05:29.16 --> 02:05:30.16
You feel it.

2851
02:05:30.16 --> 02:05:31.16
You.

2852
02:05:31.16 --> 02:05:32.16
You.

2853
02:05:32.16 --> 02:05:33.16
Yeah.

2854
02:05:33.16 --> 02:05:34.16
Help.

2855
02:05:34.16 --> 02:05:35.16
You utilize like oxygen better in your muscles.

2856
02:05:35.16 --> 02:05:36.16
Something like that.

2857
02:05:36.16 --> 02:05:38.16
I'm not the scientist behind it.

2858
02:05:38.16 --> 02:05:39.16
Obviously.

2859
02:05:39.16 --> 02:05:40.16
You can't read about it.

2860
02:05:40.16 --> 02:05:41.16
If you want.

2861
02:05:41.16 --> 02:05:42.16
But downs are good one.

2862
02:05:42.16 --> 02:05:43.16
Anyway, check out all the supplements they're 10% off.

2863
02:05:43.16 --> 02:05:45.16
And they're all legit.

2864
02:05:45.16 --> 02:05:49.16
And I don't know if a warrior bar is even a supplement.

2865
02:05:49.16 --> 02:05:50.16
But it's a bar.

2866
02:05:50.16 --> 02:05:51.16
It's a food.

2867
02:05:51.16 --> 02:05:52.16
Yeah.

2868
02:05:52.16 --> 02:05:53.16
It's like a food.

2869
02:05:53.16 --> 02:05:54.16
It's good though.

2870
02:05:54.16 --> 02:05:56.16
Check down one out.

2871
02:05:56.16 --> 02:05:57.16
Check that one out.

2872
02:05:57.16 --> 02:05:59.16
Rest assured you'll like how it tastes.

2873
02:05:59.16 --> 02:06:00.16
Do your check it out.

2874
02:06:00.16 --> 02:06:01.16
That favor.

2875
02:06:01.16 --> 02:06:02.16
That favor.

2876
02:06:02.16 --> 02:06:03.16
Yes.

2877
02:06:03.16 --> 02:06:04.16
Yes.

2878
02:06:04.16 --> 02:06:08.16
There's some ways also subscribe to the podcast on iTunes.

2879
02:06:08.16 --> 02:06:09.16
Of course.

2880
02:06:09.16 --> 02:06:12.16
If you feel like leaving a review don't like hesitate to leave the review.

2881
02:06:12.16 --> 02:06:14.16
If you just leave the review, just do it.

2882
02:06:14.16 --> 02:06:16.16
Like if you feel like doing it, you know how you're like,

2883
02:06:16.16 --> 02:06:20.16
I like I could say this about this whatever thing.

2884
02:06:20.16 --> 02:06:21.16
Or you're like, yeah.

2885
02:06:21.16 --> 02:06:24.16
And you might be thinking, well, those guys are going to read it.

2886
02:06:24.16 --> 02:06:25.16
No.

2887
02:06:25.16 --> 02:06:26.16
We'll read it.

2888
02:06:26.16 --> 02:06:28.16
And I'm going to take some input and we'll be fired up.

2889
02:06:28.16 --> 02:06:32.16
It's motivating when people are fired up and leaving reviews.

2890
02:06:32.16 --> 02:06:34.16
It's a connection.

2891
02:06:34.16 --> 02:06:36.16
You know, and it makes me go, you know what?

2892
02:06:36.16 --> 02:06:38.16
We're going to get this thing a little bit harder.

2893
02:06:38.16 --> 02:06:39.16
Yeah.

2894
02:06:39.16 --> 02:06:41.16
When you're like, that juck was very articulate.

2895
02:06:41.16 --> 02:06:43.16
Makes juck a want to be even more articulate.

2896
02:06:43.16 --> 02:06:44.16
Right?

2897
02:06:44.16 --> 02:06:46.16
Yes.

2898
02:06:46.16 --> 02:06:47.16
It does indeed.

2899
02:06:47.16 --> 02:06:48.16
It's like, I'm a do that.

2900
02:06:48.16 --> 02:06:51.16
And you know, if you're anything helps do that actually helps.

2901
02:06:51.16 --> 02:06:55.16
The ratings or something with with iTunes when there's money.

2902
02:06:55.16 --> 02:06:57.16
iTunes when there's more reviews.

2903
02:06:57.16 --> 02:06:59.16
So why do we want to have good readings ratings?

2904
02:06:59.16 --> 02:07:01.16
So then it gets bumped up.

2905
02:07:01.16 --> 02:07:02.16
Why do we want to bump up?

2906
02:07:02.16 --> 02:07:03.16
Some more people listen to it.

2907
02:07:03.16 --> 02:07:05.16
Why do we want more people listen to it?

2908
02:07:05.16 --> 02:07:07.16
Because we want more people getting after it.

2909
02:07:07.16 --> 02:07:09.16
We want more people to do better.

2910
02:07:09.16 --> 02:07:09.16
Yeah.

2911
02:07:09.16 --> 02:07:11.16
I want more people in the game.

2912
02:07:11.16 --> 02:07:12.16
Yeah.

2913
02:07:12.16 --> 02:07:13.16
I want to get more feedback.

2914
02:07:13.16 --> 02:07:14.16
I want to talk to more people.

2915
02:07:14.16 --> 02:07:15.16
Yep.

2916
02:07:15.16 --> 02:07:21.16
When I see Brady Lanter at his jutsu class saying, I just got after told me.

2917
02:07:21.16 --> 02:07:23.16
He lost 30 pounds.

2918
02:07:23.16 --> 02:07:26.16
He lost 30 pounds.

2919
02:07:26.16 --> 02:07:28.16
That's what we want more of.

2920
02:07:28.16 --> 02:07:29.16
That's what I want more of.

2921
02:07:29.16 --> 02:07:30.16
That's it.

2922
02:07:30.16 --> 02:07:31.16
And I'm assuming you want that.

2923
02:07:31.16 --> 02:07:32.16
That's why.

2924
02:07:32.16 --> 02:07:34.16
So ultimately it really gets down to that.

2925
02:07:34.16 --> 02:07:35.16
I definitely.

2926
02:07:35.16 --> 02:07:37.16
I hate to use the word motivated.

2927
02:07:37.16 --> 02:07:39.16
But I guess there is no other word.

2928
02:07:39.16 --> 02:07:44.16
I am definitely motivated by the people that are making their lives better.

2929
02:07:44.16 --> 02:07:46.16
That are the people that are getting better physically.

2930
02:07:46.16 --> 02:07:48.16
By the people that are getting better mentally.

2931
02:07:48.16 --> 02:07:51.16
That right me an email or send me a note that says,

2932
02:07:51.16 --> 02:07:55.16
Oh, had to use some, had to use some flanking on my boss today.

2933
02:07:55.16 --> 02:07:56.16
Got him.

2934
02:07:56.16 --> 02:07:56.16
Yep.

2935
02:07:56.16 --> 02:07:58.16
That is good to go.

2936
02:07:58.16 --> 02:07:59.16
That was in person.

2937
02:07:59.16 --> 02:08:00.16
That's what I like to hear.

2938
02:08:00.16 --> 02:08:10.16
When someone says, Hey, echo, can I use your in jockel's likeness in a thing on my bulletin board for my students to employ extreme ownership?

2939
02:08:10.16 --> 02:08:11.16
Can I do that?

2940
02:08:11.16 --> 02:08:14.16
Just the fact that that's a question you want to ask?

2941
02:08:14.16 --> 02:08:15.16
Makes it.

2942
02:08:15.16 --> 02:08:16.16
Just a minute.

2943
02:08:16.16 --> 02:08:17.16
Like I talked to before.

2944
02:08:17.16 --> 02:08:18.16
You're interesting.

2945
02:08:18.16 --> 02:08:19.16
So I talked about today.

2946
02:08:19.16 --> 02:08:22.16
I didn't know about getting after it when I was 13 years old.

2947
02:08:22.16 --> 02:08:25.16
Imagine somebody being in a classroom and being like, Hey, you want to get after it?

2948
02:08:25.16 --> 02:08:26.16
Here's what you got to do.

2949
02:08:26.16 --> 02:08:27.16
Here's this.

2950
02:08:27.16 --> 02:08:28.16
Here's a couple guys.

2951
02:08:28.16 --> 02:08:29.16
They're getting after it.

2952
02:08:29.16 --> 02:08:30.16
You know what?

2953
02:08:30.16 --> 02:08:31.16
Why don't you get after it?

2954
02:08:31.16 --> 02:08:32.16
13 year old boy?

2955
02:08:32.16 --> 02:08:33.16
13 year old girl?

2956
02:08:33.16 --> 02:08:34.16
Why don't you make something happen?

2957
02:08:34.16 --> 02:08:35.16
You know what?

2958
02:08:35.16 --> 02:08:38.16
You know there's people that do 500 pull-ups of workout?

2959
02:08:38.16 --> 02:08:39.16
They don't do 28.

2960
02:08:39.16 --> 02:08:41.16
28 done many things around here.

2961
02:08:41.16 --> 02:08:42.16
Step up your game.

2962
02:08:42.16 --> 02:08:45.16
So exposing the world.

2963
02:08:45.16 --> 02:08:48.16
So that people can do better.

2964
02:08:48.16 --> 02:08:49.16
Do more.

2965
02:08:49.16 --> 02:08:50.16
Be more.

2966
02:08:50.16 --> 02:08:51.16
Let's get to go.

2967
02:08:51.16 --> 02:08:52.16
Yeah.

2968
02:08:52.16 --> 02:08:59.16
If you had more people being less abrasive, losing their temper left or less exercising

2969
02:08:59.16 --> 02:09:02.16
extreme ownership and discipline and all things.

2970
02:09:02.16 --> 02:09:05.16
Persuing freedom through discipline.

2971
02:09:05.16 --> 02:09:09.16
That is a better place across the board.

2972
02:09:09.16 --> 02:09:14.16
You might even go so far as to say unmedicated daily discipline and all things.

2973
02:09:14.16 --> 02:09:15.16
You know.

2974
02:09:15.16 --> 02:09:19.16
So that's the ultimate goal.

2975
02:09:19.16 --> 02:09:22.16
Also, subscribe to YouTube.

2976
02:09:22.16 --> 02:09:25.16
If you want, add some more videos on there.

2977
02:09:25.16 --> 02:09:27.16
Aside from just the podcast video.

2978
02:09:27.16 --> 02:09:30.16
Add some more videos on there.

2979
02:09:30.16 --> 02:09:31.16
And we have been.

2980
02:09:31.16 --> 02:09:37.16
And I think that we, not you echo, but we, the rest of us.

2981
02:09:37.16 --> 02:09:41.16
I think we can motivate you more to make more videos.

2982
02:09:41.16 --> 02:09:46.16
Because every time you make a video like when you, not just a clip of the podcast, but when

2983
02:09:46.16 --> 02:09:50.16
you make a legit video, I'm always like, yeah.

2984
02:09:50.16 --> 02:09:52.16
And I think a lot of people say the same thing.

2985
02:09:52.16 --> 02:09:56.16
And there's actually a lot of troops out there that are, that are making badass videos, too.

2986
02:09:56.16 --> 02:09:57.16
Yes.

2987
02:09:57.16 --> 02:10:02.16
We've had Jean, Jean, Roderick, Jean Roderick make some killer videos.

2988
02:10:02.16 --> 02:10:06.16
Can we put his videos on the Jockel podcast page?

2989
02:10:06.16 --> 02:10:09.16
I think I did a damn I'm gonna put videos on there in a while.

2990
02:10:09.16 --> 02:10:11.16
But yes, we can.

2991
02:10:11.16 --> 02:10:12.16
We should do that.

2992
02:10:12.16 --> 02:10:13.16
We should do that.

2993
02:10:13.16 --> 02:10:17.16
So that everybody can see all the troop of work that goes out there.

2994
02:10:17.16 --> 02:10:18.16
You know what it does, too?

2995
02:10:18.16 --> 02:10:22.16
In the small little way where, you know, okay, you'll say some words.

2996
02:10:22.16 --> 02:10:25.16
You'll say, you'll say what you say.

2997
02:10:25.16 --> 02:10:27.16
And I take it a certain way.

2998
02:10:27.16 --> 02:10:31.16
I'm like, dang that really hit me at resonated with me.

2999
02:10:31.16 --> 02:10:37.16
Other people, other words might hit them harder or less harder or whatever.

3000
02:10:37.16 --> 02:10:42.16
So if people have like video editing skills, you know, or they know how to video edit

3001
02:10:42.16 --> 02:10:45.16
And stuff like that and put tracks and do that stuff.

3002
02:10:45.16 --> 02:10:50.16
When they put it out, it's kind of, it is a representation of how those words hit them.

3003
02:10:50.16 --> 02:10:51.16
Yeah.

3004
02:10:51.16 --> 02:10:56.16
You know, like, you make a decision to put a certain type of track behind what you're saying for a reason.

3005
02:10:56.16 --> 02:11:00.16
So it's so interesting to see, dang, that's how that hit him.

3006
02:11:00.16 --> 02:11:03.16
You know, in this feeling is how it hit him.

3007
02:11:03.16 --> 02:11:06.16
And it's like, dang, you kind of get a different dimension of it.

3008
02:11:06.16 --> 02:11:12.16
It's cool too because for me, I'm, I don't hear my words, right?

3009
02:11:12.16 --> 02:11:14.16
I don't hear my words.

3010
02:11:14.16 --> 02:11:22.16
Then I hear my words with, with the same thing you're saying, like, the way it's entering their brain.

3011
02:11:22.16 --> 02:11:24.16
Because we make a video, right?

3012
02:11:24.16 --> 02:11:28.16
When you make a video, it's a reflection of the, what's going on in your mind.

3013
02:11:28.16 --> 02:11:29.16
Yeah.

3014
02:11:29.16 --> 02:11:34.16
And so like some of those videos that Jean made, I was like, Oh, yeah.

3015
02:11:34.16 --> 02:11:39.16
Like, yeah, like it's going, it's taking me inside his head and what it appears to be from inside his head,

3016
02:11:39.16 --> 02:11:42.16
which is awesome to hear and awesome to see.

3017
02:11:42.16 --> 02:11:48.16
You know, so yeah, we should get those and he had a couple that went didn't go through the copyrighted material.

3018
02:11:48.16 --> 02:11:53.16
I don't know if he took the wrong songs or some, but it was a bummer because some of those were awesome.

3019
02:11:53.16 --> 02:11:55.16
That's, yeah, that's part of the battle right there.

3020
02:11:55.16 --> 02:11:57.16
I think, but hey, you know, whichever.

3021
02:11:57.16 --> 02:12:03.16
But anyways, what I was going to say is I think the more people that are YouTube subscribers,

3022
02:12:03.16 --> 02:12:08.16
I think the more motivated that you will personally get, that's my opinion,

3023
02:12:08.16 --> 02:12:11.16
to make even more badass videos.

3024
02:12:11.16 --> 02:12:12.16
That's my opinion.

3025
02:12:12.16 --> 02:12:14.16
Well, like you think it might get like a competition.

3026
02:12:14.16 --> 02:12:15.16
You'll make the better one.

3027
02:12:15.16 --> 02:12:17.16
No, no, no, no, I don't think that.

3028
02:12:17.16 --> 02:12:19.16
I think you're inspired by this video.

3029
02:12:19.16 --> 02:12:24.16
It's the same way I am that other people make, but I'm saying, I think you will just be motivated more of the more people.

3030
02:12:24.16 --> 02:12:31.16
Like you know, when you say a video has just been uploaded by Jockel podcast and you know that it's going to 50,000 people.

3031
02:12:31.16 --> 02:12:34.16
You'll be a boom, click, boom, click.

3032
02:12:34.16 --> 02:12:36.16
You'll start getting after a little bit more.

3033
02:12:36.16 --> 02:12:39.16
Yeah, and personally, I want you to get after it more.

3034
02:12:39.16 --> 02:12:43.16
That's the director for just the process.

3035
02:12:43.16 --> 02:12:46.16
One is like one of the original ones that someone else made.

3036
02:12:46.16 --> 02:12:51.16
I hate that I can't remember like the names of the people did it, but it's the one.

3037
02:12:51.16 --> 02:12:54.16
It was to the Pacific soundtrack.

3038
02:12:54.16 --> 02:12:56.16
Oh, yeah, it was one of the original.

3039
02:12:56.16 --> 02:13:01.16
I was drinking one night.

3040
02:13:01.16 --> 02:13:04.16
Yeah, it was on time when you made drinking.

3041
02:13:04.16 --> 02:13:08.16
I was drinking some of us playing that was like, bro, I'm feeling so deeply right now.

3042
02:13:08.16 --> 02:13:12.16
I played literally like eight to 12 times just in a row.

3043
02:13:12.16 --> 02:13:16.16
Dang, this is so like just because you see their clips from movies.

3044
02:13:16.16 --> 02:13:21.16
They're clips from this and it's a mashup and you know, the music and here's the thing.

3045
02:13:21.16 --> 02:13:24.16
It's not like hard core music.

3046
02:13:24.16 --> 02:13:27.16
It's like, man, it's really good.

3047
02:13:27.16 --> 02:13:33.16
And I think like I said, that's like such a good way to see not only just your words,

3048
02:13:33.16 --> 02:13:37.16
but how someone else heard them interpret them and put them back out there.

3049
02:13:37.16 --> 02:13:40.16
It's like a whole other dimension.

3050
02:13:40.16 --> 02:13:44.16
Anyway, yes, I'll get more on the YouTube for sure.

3051
02:13:44.16 --> 02:13:45.16
I'm already more on the YouTube.

3052
02:13:45.16 --> 02:13:46.16
Yeah, you are.

3053
02:13:46.16 --> 02:13:48.16
But I'll keep it up. I'll keep it up. I'll do it.

3054
02:13:48.16 --> 02:13:49.16
I like that. Do some more.

3055
02:13:49.16 --> 02:13:50.16
We'll do some different topics.

3056
02:13:50.16 --> 02:13:51.16
I'll make some videos.

3057
02:13:51.16 --> 02:13:52.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3058
02:13:52.16 --> 02:13:53.16
No, I won't.

3059
02:13:53.16 --> 02:13:55.16
I won't. I'll get there.

3060
02:13:55.16 --> 02:14:03.16
Also, to support this podcast in the event of you being in the mood to support this podcast,

3061
02:14:03.16 --> 02:14:05.16
you can get some cool stuff.

3062
02:14:05.16 --> 02:14:08.16
I think it's cool at jacquestor.com.

3063
02:14:08.16 --> 02:14:11.16
T-shirts, the multiple layers to them.

3064
02:14:11.16 --> 02:14:16.16
Not physically, psychologically, philosophically, they have multiple layers to them.

3065
02:14:16.16 --> 02:14:17.16
All of them.

3066
02:14:17.16 --> 02:14:20.16
Some Easter eggs too.

3067
02:14:20.16 --> 02:14:23.16
Sure, it's travel mugs and bumper stickers.

3068
02:14:23.16 --> 02:14:26.16
Now, new stuff that's available right now.

3069
02:14:26.16 --> 02:14:28.16
Well, may or may not be available, maybe sold out.

3070
02:14:28.16 --> 02:14:30.16
But they could be on back there.

3071
02:14:30.16 --> 02:14:31.16
You can order it.

3072
02:14:31.16 --> 02:14:32.16
You can order it. Yes.

3073
02:14:32.16 --> 02:14:33.16
New stuff.

3074
02:14:33.16 --> 02:14:34.16
Rash guards.

3075
02:14:34.16 --> 02:14:37.16
I thought it was for Duget 2, but

3076
02:14:37.16 --> 02:14:39.16
therefore everything.

3077
02:14:39.16 --> 02:14:44.16
Therefore lifting, like CrossFit, especially running is a good one like bike.

3078
02:14:44.16 --> 02:14:47.16
Like basically everything that starts.

3079
02:14:47.16 --> 02:14:51.16
Spend extra, it's a for surfing. I think primarily really.

3080
02:14:51.16 --> 02:14:52.16
But lifting whatever.

3081
02:14:52.16 --> 02:14:54.16
Of course, Giu-Gitsu.

3082
02:14:54.16 --> 02:14:55.16
Rash guards are cool.

3083
02:14:55.16 --> 02:14:56.16
Check them out. If you like them,

3084
02:14:56.16 --> 02:14:58.16
get one of those or two or whatever to support.

3085
02:14:58.16 --> 02:14:59.16
Stickers.

3086
02:14:59.16 --> 02:15:01.16
And then, Giu-Gitsu patches.

3087
02:15:01.16 --> 02:15:03.16
And just patches.

3088
02:15:03.16 --> 02:15:04.16
You can sew them on.

3089
02:15:04.16 --> 02:15:06.16
They're iron on, but you sew them on as long as you want.

3090
02:15:06.16 --> 02:15:08.16
Put on your bag.

3091
02:15:08.16 --> 02:15:09.16
What have you?

3092
02:15:09.16 --> 02:15:11.16
Giu-Gitsu patches for your ghee.

3093
02:15:11.16 --> 02:15:12.16
That stuff.

3094
02:15:12.16 --> 02:15:14.16
New things coming within the next week or two.

3095
02:15:14.16 --> 02:15:16.16
Women's.

3096
02:15:16.16 --> 02:15:17.16
Tank tops.

3097
02:15:17.16 --> 02:15:20.16
I think it actually lives pretty soon.

3098
02:15:20.16 --> 02:15:22.16
Things still too.

3099
02:15:22.16 --> 02:15:24.16
But yeah, there it is.

3100
02:15:24.16 --> 02:15:25.16
You know.

3101
02:15:25.16 --> 02:15:26.16
Oh, good support that way.

3102
02:15:26.16 --> 02:15:27.16
Yep. And that's all.

3103
02:15:27.16 --> 02:15:28.16
Awesome.

3104
02:15:28.16 --> 02:15:30.16
We appreciate that support.

3105
02:15:30.16 --> 02:15:34.16
That is a cool way.

3106
02:15:34.16 --> 02:15:37.16
You know, to help us out with what we're doing.

3107
02:15:37.16 --> 02:15:41.16
Also, another thing just came out is a little something.

3108
02:15:41.16 --> 02:15:43.16
Little Jocquite tea.

3109
02:15:43.16 --> 02:15:44.16
If you want to get some of that,

3110
02:15:44.16 --> 02:15:46.16
it's pomegranate.

3111
02:15:46.16 --> 02:15:48.16
And it's, somebody, I don't know where it came from.

3112
02:15:48.16 --> 02:15:54.16
I don't know when I started utilizing it, but I've utilized it for quite some time now.

3113
02:15:54.16 --> 02:15:56.16
It's live on Amazon.

3114
02:15:56.16 --> 02:15:57.16
It is live.

3115
02:15:57.16 --> 02:15:58.16
It's live on Amazon.

3116
02:15:58.16 --> 02:15:59.16
It's okay.

3117
02:15:59.16 --> 02:16:05.16
Go ahead, get on there, order it, and get your white tea on.

3118
02:16:05.16 --> 02:16:07.16
That's what we when you see me drinking it here.

3119
02:16:07.16 --> 02:16:10.16
If I'm not drinking an alpha brain, I'm drinking white tea.

3120
02:16:10.16 --> 02:16:13.16
And white tea is definitely what I'm drinking during the show.

3121
02:16:13.16 --> 02:16:15.16
So, give it a try.

3122
02:16:15.16 --> 02:16:17.16
You might dig it.

3123
02:16:17.16 --> 02:16:19.16
It's available on Amazon.

3124
02:16:19.16 --> 02:16:21.16
You could probably click through.

3125
02:16:21.16 --> 02:16:23.16
Unless you have the true potential thing.

3126
02:16:23.16 --> 02:16:24.16
You can just hit it.

3204
02:20:11.16 --> 02:20:14.16
And to all YouTubers,

3207
02:20:19.16 --> 02:20:27.16

3208
02:20:27.16 --> 02:20:30.16
give it everything you got,

3209
02:20:30.16 --> 02:20:32.16
put your head down,

3210
02:20:32.16 --> 02:20:36.16
grit your teeth,

3211
02:20:36.16 --> 02:20:39.16

3212
02:20:39.16 --> 02:20:41.16
So,

3213
02:20:41.16 --> 02:20:43.16

3214
02:20:43.16 --> 02:20:47.16
