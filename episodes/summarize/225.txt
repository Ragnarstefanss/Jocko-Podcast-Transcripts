He's like looking everybody with his eyes all big nonetheless I think that was like I think he got aggressive one day and people like shut up and we're like hey this guy's like You know how when someone's never aggressive then they start yelling you're like everyone kind of be quiet But after a while, you're like, nah, because if you get knocked down, which you will, you can knock down like three times within like 15 seconds, you know, like the faster you can get up and start running again, it's like, bro, that's a good skill to have, you know, kind of thing. He's yelling he's you know pushing people over That is not the type of aggressiveness that you need to be an effective leader You don't need to be allowed mouth you don't need to be brash don't need to get in people's faces What being aggressive means is Is taking action That's the kind of aggressiveness that I'm talking about that's the kind of aggressiveness that general matters is talking about and You know the definition actually wrote this down the definition of Aggressive or one of the definitions of being aggressive is forceful and sometimes overly assertive pursuit of ones aims So First of all forceful we get right sometimes overly assertive something means sometimes that you have to go a little bit like Harder and here's why that's important because listen in combat Almost nothing will happen the way you want it to if you don't force it that way And you know, like she was, she was like totally, I don't know if the word stoked, but she realized that this, whatever, you know, this gap between my teeth, which some people might have is a big insecurity, like, oh, you know, cover your mouth. I'm not sure if you're a singer, her to whatever, you know, like, when I touch here, like, my finger hurts or whatever, and then the doctor goes, okay, the solution is don't touch there, you know, kind of thing for that's like, it's real obvious to people, you know, it's the torture genius that Lave talks about an extreme ownership. Yeah, those kind of for lack of a bit of some Superficial personality traits that are aggressive some people say oh well that's that Aggressive, you know where there's more depth to it we're like Again, like you know you can think of like a Like, if that's in your mind, like, people just won't even get out of my way when I'm trying to go around them, like, well, bro, that's like some sensitive, like, bro, that's where you're finding this, the, right, you're finding Corvette. You're just gonna look like a weasel Honey, I have this vision of the guy, you know who got gets fired right in on this way out his is What he called like a little basket of his stuff you know that plastic image As like, you know, I'm not like disparaging fitness people at all, but you ever had an extreme fitness person where if you ate some bubble gum, they'd be like, you know much sugars in that bubble gum, the thing is, that's all true. He was I had an assistant platoon commander and a aggressive great guy and He you know, I didn't you know as I got to know him you know, and I was like, so would you study in college? and the genuineness Where this is this was a question like that Kind of you get guys who get ask a lot like put you know when you know it would a lot of times be about the other person taking ownership Oh, right which is crazy But yeah, you you kind of have that hope you actually do have that hope yes, sure But the actual like expectation that you know where like an expectation is there that can be let down I can't be mad at you right when you don't take ownership look I guess I can't be mad at you, but it doesn't help right Yeah, I mean, I don't want to get too into like, what, you know, where, where we stand on like the whole thing or whatever, but there's like a big picture, small picture scenario going on. And he lived a good life and their memorial service was You know a small kind of private affair You know there was probably I don't know 70 or 80 people there You know all the extended family of all the kids and then friends the family and some of his friends and it was Was a nice service We get it solved That's the beauty of extreme ownership is that the problem gets solved So you're so when you fire a guy or would it you know theoretically it's kind of like you're firing them because Like you the example you just sit right there with the guy who has that attitude right Hmm what is Jason Jason Gardner says puts it kind of a cool like good way to just really wrap your head around like being a default mode something along the lines of like It's easier it's better to like have to pull someone back totally then have to push them forward No, you know, because it's kind of like, brother, this guy's just like, you know, writing down positive things, right? I was like at a bar, you know, burping into, when I was young and single and whatever, hanging out, you know, having some beverages and I'm choked with chatting with some girl that I met and you know, as we're talking, we're just kind of just talking, having a good time, whatever. I don't know some fictional or maybe even not in fictional like Maybe Japanese Business tycoon who doesn't say nothing really You know he's making aggressive moves like that's aggressive guy. But if you're going through that training with that in your mind, like, oh, I know why I'm doing this, but you're going to charge that thing and, you know, promsolve better while you're trying to, yeah, man. so he was like I remember guys we just run circles around them, you know like people wouldn't listen and all this like he had trouble controlling the class We'll say that You have the little, you know, you have the powerful boss walking around the little, you know, taking everything, writing every little thing down, you know, kind of thing. Like, even like in Jiu-Jitsu, this is good examples, like like, hate the scape or shrimp being right. No one the fire You know no one to reprimand the problem is getting solved and you could go right up through the chain of command You know that the platoon leader says I'm gonna cover it rehearsals and the task unit commander says I'm gonna actually Go through a briefing on why fields of fire are so important But when people start taking ownership Then the problem gets solved and it doesn't get anywhere There's there becomes a limitation where the problem is no longer a problem so if the if the machine gunner shoots out his field of fire and says You know what hey my fault next time I will confirm that I know my field of fire before pulling trigger Okay remember to say how extreme ownership is always on the top right like no matter the problem Even that let's say I got fired like I got fired I took extreme ownership. You know like that kind stuff forever like how would you like? You know, maybe some here and there if there's like a big influx or whatever because of like, you know, the staffing and stuff. but since that is a natural thing It's kind of like it has to be part of extreme ownership You know it just has to be for you to be compelled to solve the problem if you Believe like for real belief. And she's like, oh, you know, what are you, you know, what are you, you know, what are you, I'm a dental hygienist. Everyone where you go, you're like, okay, so sometimes like, I want to say all the time, if people aren't asking for like advice, not all the time, sometimes it works. This is exactly why aggression has to be your default mode Your default mode is aggressive if your default mode is aggressive and it's not the right answer You just use the other answer right your default mode is aggressive that's the why I originally said to these young See aloftsters your default mode has to be aggressive so if you're not sure if you should stay as your go go to the default Which is gonna be aggressive because Nine times out of ten seven times out of ten eight times out of ten that's gonna be a better move than sitting on your ass and doing nothing That's what's gonna get your kill so your default mode is to go now.
