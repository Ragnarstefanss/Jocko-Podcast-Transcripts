[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 307 with Echo Charles and me.
[00:00:04] Jockel willing Good evening Echo.
[00:00:05] Good evening.
[00:00:06] Also joining us again tonight is Dave Burke.
[00:00:08] Good evening Dave.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:10] I gave everyone fair warning that this book was going to take a while.
[00:00:14] We are going to continue the review of on the psychology of military incompetence which we
[00:00:19] started on podcast 303 304 305 306.
[00:00:26] Now we're on 307.
[00:00:27] You haven't listened to those go back and do so.
[00:00:30] If you listen to those, you probably realized that which I realized I haven't pointed
[00:00:34] out yet.
[00:00:35] I hope it's obvious even though the context of these books is military.
[00:00:40] It doesn't just apply to the military.
[00:00:41] It applies to everyone in every leadership situation which is why we can learn so much
[00:00:48] from these insights with that.
[00:00:51] Let's get.
[00:00:52] Well, let's get back to the book.
[00:00:54] Yes.
[00:00:55] Let's say on the psychology of military incompetence by Dr. Norman F. Dixon also World War
[00:01:02] II that wounded in action legit guy.
[00:01:06] Little bit too crazy on the psychology stuff sometimes, especially nowadays.
[00:01:12] The psychology of some of the psychology of Freud's been debunked.
[00:01:15] Freud was a cocaine addict.
[00:01:17] Freud was what's it prescribed in cocaine for like every problem that you had.
[00:01:25] You said, oh, I'm not feeling really cocaine.
[00:01:27] Oh, you know, I'm sick to my stomach cocaine.
[00:01:30] I'm not getting along with my wife cocaine.
[00:01:31] This guy was doing cocaine and prescribing cocaine.
[00:01:35] And apparently he lied about a bunch of stuff too.
[00:01:38] He would say that he cured people that never got cured or he would say that they were
[00:01:42] cured but they were really just cocaine addicts.
[00:01:46] So there is some stuff.
[00:01:49] And I don't know, the I never was a big psychology guy until we had Jordan Peterson
[00:01:58] on this podcast.
[00:01:59] That was kind of the first time I said, oh, I get it.
[00:02:01] That's where I realized these guys are brain mechanics that understand there's a problem.
[00:02:06] They look at it.
[00:02:07] They go, yep, we've seen this before.
[00:02:08] Yep, I know this pattern.
[00:02:09] Oh, you're scared of this thing or you don't get along with these types of people or whatever.
[00:02:14] They say, yep, we've seen that before.
[00:02:16] Here's how we can actually fix it.
[00:02:18] I prior to that thought psychology was what's the right word kind of, you know,
[00:02:27] gobbledy-gook.
[00:02:28] Is that the right word?
[00:02:29] What would you just say?
[00:02:30] We'll we'll.
[00:02:31] Yeah, a little bit of woo-woo stuff, a little bit like, hey, how could these guys?
[00:02:35] What are they going to do with spring, your ear?
[00:02:37] You know, I thought it was that kind of thing.
[00:02:38] I didn't realize that they had methodologies and that they made sense.
[00:02:41] What about hypnosis or whatever?
[00:02:43] I don't really understand hypnosis too much.
[00:02:46] I've never been hypnotized.
[00:02:47] I've never even been to one of those shows where people get hypnotized and they act like
[00:02:51] a monkey or whatever.
[00:02:52] Have you been to one of those?
[00:02:53] Yeah.
[00:02:54] You believe it?
[00:02:55] I believe that hypnosis can work on some people.
[00:02:57] In fact, I think that's the chance.
[00:02:59] Yeah, yeah, but the show that I went to, I went to two of them that I remember.
[00:03:04] And I remember thinking this hypnitist isn't that good, either not that good or the
[00:03:11] person, the subject or whatever was just sort of going along.
[00:03:15] Not because they're re-in on some scam.
[00:03:17] But more, there's down for the call.
[00:03:18] Down for the call, exactly right.
[00:03:19] They didn't want to make everything lit down and stuff.
[00:03:21] So they just did it.
[00:03:22] Have you ever seen anywhere you'd hypnotized?
[00:03:23] No.
[00:03:24] Have you ever been hypnotized?
[00:03:25] No.
[00:03:26] Well, there's little tests they can do.
[00:03:28] They let that.
[00:03:29] I saw them in Rogan.
[00:03:30] Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:31] I saw that from a role in your eyes back or something.
[00:03:33] Like, who's that guy?
[00:03:34] I don't know if you're good.
[00:03:37] So that's kind of, you know how you kind of looked at it.
[00:03:40] Not really, 100% sure.
[00:03:42] That's kind of how I looked at psychology before.
[00:03:44] Or Jordan came on and I understood.
[00:03:49] And what was weird was how he was explaining exposure therapy, which is exactly what's
[00:03:54] in way the word kidnised.
[00:03:55] Oh, this stuff can make sense.
[00:03:57] Got it.
[00:03:58] But of course there's some weird stuff.
[00:03:59] They're still weird stuff in psychology.
[00:04:01] And they're doing weird stuff right now in the psychological world.
[00:04:05] The way they're coming out with all kinds of weird things.
[00:04:07] So did you study psychology or did you take any psych...
[00:04:11] I'm sure I took something.
[00:04:13] Actually, I'm not sure I did.
[00:04:14] But I don't remember if I did, I don't remember it other than maybe whatever you learned
[00:04:18] in high school.
[00:04:20] Maybe that's what maybe think it was.
[00:04:22] That's the term you used.
[00:04:24] And what did I say?
[00:04:25] Gobble, the Gobble.
[00:04:26] The Cube.
[00:04:27] Some advice.
[00:04:28] So the psychologist out there, I apologize.
[00:04:31] It's not Gobble the Gook and it's not Woo Woo.
[00:04:34] It's legit.
[00:04:35] It's mind mechanics.
[00:04:37] Well, okay, you ever heard of Pavlov's dog?
[00:04:40] Yes.
[00:04:41] Okay, so just that alone.
[00:04:42] So that's legit.
[00:04:43] Yeah, just that on think about it.
[00:04:44] Frickin' you just associate a bell with food and it's your body response.
[00:04:51] You're being hit.
[00:04:52] Stuff that you don't control just responds in that way.
[00:04:54] It's like, okay, so you just think about how deep that goes.
[00:04:58] And then people who understand that and can navigate and guide and influence in that way.
[00:05:02] Yep.
[00:05:03] Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:05:04] And so here's the deal.
[00:05:05] On this book, I didn't want to just start trying to play psychological historian.
[00:05:13] Right.
[00:05:14] And go back.
[00:05:15] But there's definitely some things I read.
[00:05:16] I was like, okay, bro.
[00:05:18] Hey, Dr. Nixon, I respect you, but I'm not going to, it's too much, right?
[00:05:26] It's too much.
[00:05:27] A lot of that Freudian stuff is too much.
[00:05:30] Weird.
[00:05:31] Not just weird.
[00:05:32] It's not that it's just weird.
[00:05:33] If it's weird, but it makes, but it's backed up.
[00:05:36] Cool.
[00:05:37] There's weird stuff going on in your head.
[00:05:38] But when you read something, you go, that seems kind of weird.
[00:05:41] Then you find out that it's all deepunked anyways.
[00:05:44] And that was the deal with Freud.
[00:05:46] Freud, like I said, on the last podcast, a broken clock is right twice a day.
[00:05:51] Well, that's the same thing with Freud.
[00:05:52] He was right about some stuff.
[00:05:54] The biggest thing being that you do have underlying psychological thoughts, subliminal
[00:06:00] thoughts, your subconscious thoughts, not subliminal.
[00:06:02] Subconscious thoughts that would drive your decision making it, make you act a certain way.
[00:06:07] So if you got whatever your parents treated you a certain way, you're going to tend
[00:06:12] to wave, if your parents built distrust in you, you might not trust people as much.
[00:06:18] If they wanted you to win all the time, you might, and that could go two ways, right?
[00:06:22] You could be like, oh, I'm going to win or I don't give a shit.
[00:06:25] Yeah.
[00:06:26] Right?
[00:06:27] So it's weird how you're going to turn out.
[00:06:28] But what is, you can't predict how the person's going to turn out.
[00:06:32] But you can say it has to do with the fact that every time little Johnny did get win
[00:06:37] in first place, his dad was beating him.
[00:06:40] He either grows up in his winning or he just doesn't care about competing.
[00:06:44] Right.
[00:06:45] It's not even competing.
[00:06:46] But those are underline costs.
[00:06:49] Now what Freud did was he brought it all down to like how you were potty trained.
[00:06:54] And just, no, it's not just that.
[00:06:59] So that being said, there are underlying things and this guy ends up profiling all these
[00:07:06] different people.
[00:07:07] So here we go.
[00:07:08] We're going to get into this.
[00:07:09] This section is called character and honor kind of going.
[00:07:12] It opens up with a great quote.
[00:07:14] Why should a man be in love with his fenders, though of gold?
[00:07:20] So you are chained.
[00:07:22] And you're in love with those chains.
[00:07:25] But you shouldn't be.
[00:07:26] Even if they're made of gold, you shouldn't be in love with them.
[00:07:28] And another one moderation in war is in facility.
[00:07:32] Interesting.
[00:07:34] Going to the book here in the context of militarism, the forces of conscious and of
[00:07:41] character manifest themselves in various guises, in medieval notions of shivari, in codes
[00:07:46] of honor such as the duel and in the belief that officers must of necessity be gentlemen.
[00:07:53] As Carl DeMet Tomato showed, has shown in his history of the German officer corps, these
[00:07:57] notions of honor and shivari brought about and wore themselves reinforced by a care to
[00:08:04] select officer material from the aristocracy and rural landowners.
[00:08:09] A state of affairs reflected in the contrast of snobbiness, exclusiveness, sense of honor and
[00:08:16] lack of intellectual ability, which obtained between the officer corps, corps drawn from
[00:08:22] the aristocratic junk or families of the great-per-state of Russia and those more
[00:08:28] bourgeois elements from the industrialized southwest of Germany.
[00:08:33] So these old military officers came from rich folk.
[00:08:39] And these are there's a difference between some of the rich folk that were in the city and
[00:08:42] some of the rich folk that were big landowners and they had a little bit different behavior.
[00:08:45] Not going to spend too much time on that, but I'm going to fast forward a little bit.
[00:08:48] A code of honor is a set of rules for behavior.
[00:08:51] The rules are observed because to break them provokes the distressing emotions of guilt
[00:08:58] or shame, whereas guilt is a product of knowing that one is transgressed and therefore
[00:09:02] might be found out, shame results from actually being found out in military circles traditionally
[00:09:07] the greater crime.
[00:09:10] It is usually assumed that military codes of honor serve to reduce fear.
[00:09:17] This may well be so.
[00:09:18] Their primary object, however, is to combat not so much fear as the sort of behavior to which
[00:09:25] fear might otherwise give rise.
[00:09:28] In other words, they are designed to ensure that threatening situations are met by fight
[00:09:34] rather than flight.
[00:09:36] They do this by making the social consequences of flight.
[00:09:40] The social consequences of flight rather more unpleasant than the physical consequences
[00:09:45] of flight.
[00:09:46] That's freaking radical, right?
[00:09:47] Like I would rat and you hear a team guy say this all the time, but I'd rather just
[00:09:51] freaking die than be a scissor.
[00:09:55] 100% I've heard of that, it was better fact, BTF Tony said that on this podcast, he's
[00:10:02] scared shitless of heights and he's on some 80 story building in Hong Kong or Singapore or
[00:10:09] something, he's got to repel off of it and he's totally thinking he's going to die.
[00:10:13] He's like, well, I would rather die than be a scissor up here.
[00:10:18] So they're rules work, whereas the latter might lead to physical pain, mutilation, and
[00:10:25] death, the former, ofventuates with far greater certainty in personal guilt and public
[00:10:30] shame.
[00:10:35] What I'm thinking about this is I'm saying to her, think like, who fought?
[00:10:40] Who said it to what you know what we need to do is we need to create a code of honors
[00:10:42] that we can make sure that people don't run away.
[00:10:44] That would be some really meticulous, like, preemptive ideas.
[00:10:53] I'm thinking that there's a tribal nature to this stuff.
[00:10:57] We are instinctively programmed that if you run, you're not looking out for your clan and
[00:11:05] you suck and we don't like you.
[00:11:07] I think that's, I think there's an instinct to that, not just a code that's written by
[00:11:13] modern man, but I think there's like a code that's instilled in us by being an animal.
[00:11:21] Yeah.
[00:11:22] That seems like the case for sure.
[00:11:25] Maybe the code is just to like take that in an extreme situation.
[00:11:29] Correct.
[00:11:30] And animals have it too.
[00:11:32] Like a pack of hyenas go after a lion or whatever.
[00:11:35] They go after animals that can definitely kill a couple of them.
[00:11:38] But they'd rather be the one that gets killed than be the one that runs away.
[00:11:43] And they know that if they can't run away, they're not going to survive as a species.
[00:11:46] So they got to get it on.
[00:11:48] Man, I watched some hyenas the other day.
[00:11:52] Discover each animal?
[00:11:53] No, like YouTube, freaking red zone.
[00:11:55] Like, hey, I'm nine videos deeper, whatever.
[00:11:59] But dude, this zebra was getting to eat and by hyenas.
[00:12:03] And first of all, hyenas were savage.
[00:12:05] Hyenas are my favorite land animal, by the way.
[00:12:09] But the zebra was stoic.
[00:12:11] He was having his legs eaten.
[00:12:13] And he looked, the look on his face was he was watching it after new movie.
[00:12:17] Yeah, I've seen that too.
[00:12:20] I wonder if there's like a thing that triggers on a prey animal that like, because you
[00:12:25] see that a lot.
[00:12:26] It's not like you don't see water, no, if I've ever seen any zebra, sinned or prey animal,
[00:12:31] like screaming and stuff.
[00:12:32] Oh, no, I have.
[00:12:33] You have.
[00:12:34] I always see the deer just sort of stoic.
[00:12:36] Oh, no, there's there's ones where those things are just screaming and not handling
[00:12:40] it.
[00:12:41] Yeah, I think there's stoic zebra and there's an unscheduled zebra.
[00:12:44] That's what I think.
[00:12:45] Cool.
[00:12:47] He's got a little indent here, little section.
[00:12:51] When a soldier in action sees his life in immediate danger, even the bravest will
[00:12:55] we seize to buy a moment of fear, biologically speaking, fear is a natural reflexensation
[00:12:59] of the instinct of self preservation, which dwells within every man, heroes included.
[00:13:05] Again, what's a little bit interesting about that is like Dean Ladd being on this podcast,
[00:13:10] going to Taroa and a head dean, were you scared?
[00:13:14] He's like, no, but it was going to happen to someone else.
[00:13:17] So maybe even the high-enus think it's going to happen to someone else.
[00:13:21] That Paul ain't going to hit me.
[00:13:22] We're not going to catch a freaking K-9 tooth to the jugular on this one.
[00:13:28] The victories to be one, the elementary physical sensation must somehow be artificially
[00:13:33] suppressed, over-compensated by a contrary reflex of the psychic and moral kind, converted
[00:13:39] into action.
[00:13:40] Bro, I'm a little bit in disagreement here, because I've seen guys that you just like,
[00:13:45] well, this guy doesn't care.
[00:13:46] He doesn't think he can die.
[00:13:49] Whatever, walking across the street, running across the street, totally going against,
[00:13:55] I don't think there's enough time to think, I want to go drag that guy out of the street,
[00:14:01] but it looks really dangerous, but I want to prove myself.
[00:14:05] No, they're like, hey, I'm going to go get that guy, because he's her, what do you think,
[00:14:09] Dave?
[00:14:10] Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking about all this, like, even the need to write this stuff down,
[00:14:15] all this stuff pragmatically makes sense, but I deserve people do things in environments
[00:14:20] that sort of defy some of the things that are being said.
[00:14:23] So in a bare minimum, there's definitely exceptions to this idea that all men have this
[00:14:26] thing.
[00:14:27] And if they don't all have it, some of them go through whatever that process is in light
[00:14:32] speed, if it's still happening, and I can't see it, it's happening so quickly that
[00:14:37] they're just on doing things.
[00:14:39] I have seen people do things that are dumb and be like, hey, bro, you need to get, put
[00:14:47] your head down.
[00:14:48] From a basic self preservation, like, sniper fires a good example, we would take sniper
[00:14:54] fire pretty regularly.
[00:14:56] And I've seen guys get so frustrated and so fed up, and I saw a platoon commander once
[00:15:00] behaved just incorrectly walking around on the roof to have like, no, this isn't moving
[00:15:05] past the fear.
[00:15:07] This is some other disconnect there.
[00:15:09] I know that's not exactly what you're talking about, but I've seen people behave like
[00:15:11] that.
[00:15:12] Oh, no, I was on a rooftop one time, and we started taking fire and there were some army
[00:15:17] dudes I was up there with a couple army dudes, and we started taking a little bit of fire,
[00:15:22] and it was, you know, chinching, whatever, and I'm just standing there, and the guys kind
[00:15:26] of got down, and I was just being, you know, Mr. Bath, Mr. Bath, that's right.
[00:15:31] Hey, whatever, no factor on Colonel Kilgore, and then all of a sudden like another like
[00:15:36] three rounds of ripped really closer.
[00:15:38] Yeah, I had the decks.
[00:15:40] I had the deck.
[00:15:42] I wasn't so cool anymore.
[00:15:44] So my self-preservation was kind of kicked in.
[00:15:48] Those ones are close.
[00:15:50] Yes.
[00:15:51] You threshold those kind of more further down.
[00:15:53] And that's different.
[00:15:54] You got it.
[00:15:55] There's a threshold, and you see people have different thresholds, and some maybe the threshold
[00:15:58] either doesn't exist or it's so narrow, there's no real gap there that you can observe.
[00:16:03] But to say the way he said it, I agree with you, like there's, I've seen people do
[00:16:06] things like that, that's not what I've seen.
[00:16:08] No, it's not done happen all the time, but you see it.
[00:16:10] I'm not sure.
[00:16:13] Next to the negative content of this counter reflex is the feeling of shame.
[00:16:18] If it says, you don't stand fast now, but run away, the others will laugh at you and
[00:16:24] despise you.
[00:16:25] Again, that's a lot of thought to be having in the moment of truth.
[00:16:30] That's a lot of, I mean, I've done some stuff that was dumb or what I would.
[00:16:34] I've done some stuff where it's like, hmm, hey, should I be doing this right now?
[00:16:37] Maybe not, but I don't even think about that.
[00:16:39] I wasn't thinking, oh, I don't want to look bad.
[00:16:41] I was like, hey, there go whatever crosses the tree, go to go this, whatever.
[00:16:48] Assold your must therefore be provided unless nature has done.
[00:16:51] You know, it's another good example, it's Mike Thornton.
[00:16:53] I was, you know, Mike Thornton's just huckin' ingrenade fights with people.
[00:16:57] He shot people shot.
[00:16:59] There's people all around him.
[00:17:02] And I asked him when he was on the podcast, like, oh, we know what you think and you
[00:17:04] might get shot.
[00:17:05] And he's like, no, no, he's just, no, I never thought about that.
[00:17:07] It's gonna say my friend.
[00:17:09] Next question.
[00:17:10] He was almost embarrassed that I asked that question.
[00:17:13] He was like, dude, what is wrong with you?
[00:17:15] Ha ha ha.
[00:17:16] A soldier must therefore be provided unless nature has done the job already.
[00:17:20] Oh, so he's got a little caveat.
[00:17:22] So there's a possibility that nature just made you brave with a set of automatic inhibitions
[00:17:27] that will save him in the moment of danger from a collapse of his own morale.
[00:17:31] Discipline, of course.
[00:17:32] Thank you.
[00:17:33] Discipline, of course, can hold him steady from without.
[00:17:36] And his one moral defense against internal weakness is the sense of honor to arouse this
[00:17:42] sense in the ordinary soldier cultivated and above all, inspire it by his own example
[00:17:48] is the officer's highest duty and to fulfill that duty he must himself have a sense of honor
[00:17:53] that is well developed, active and finely tuned.
[00:17:57] Yeah.
[00:17:58] That's a lot of pre-conceived thought.
[00:18:03] Like the Marine Corps, it back in what we coming up on the what anniversary of the Marine
[00:18:07] Corps?
[00:18:08] 1775 minus 20.
[00:18:11] Yeah, 100.
[00:18:12] Yeah, 100.
[00:18:13] A couple hundred and a half, whatever, 250 something years of ending the Marine Corps said,
[00:18:19] you know what we need to do.
[00:18:20] We need to create a code of honor.
[00:18:21] So that Marines, they won't run away.
[00:18:25] Like I can't see that app.
[00:18:26] No.
[00:18:27] And I'm just thinking of the basic fundamental training I've been through as an officer
[00:18:30] of the Marine Corps.
[00:18:31] I don't remember any of that.
[00:18:32] I've never been given the code of conduct.
[00:18:34] And there is unquestionably from day one, you don't want to look bad in front of your
[00:18:39] peers.
[00:18:40] I know that feeling of getting to like, officer candidate school in the basic school in
[00:18:43] flight school and like, oh, I don't want to look bad.
[00:18:45] I understand that feeling.
[00:18:47] But there was a lot of words there to describe the situation that almost implies that
[00:18:51] you're going to have some sort of cognitive process to go, let me do a quick cost benefit
[00:18:56] here of running away to save my life or, you know, what my peers will think of me
[00:19:00] down the road.
[00:19:01] Do that.
[00:19:02] I can't connect with that.
[00:19:04] Right, like three months into the basic school, you're like, you know what, if anything
[00:19:07] happens, I'm not going to run.
[00:19:08] Yeah.
[00:19:09] Check.
[00:19:11] To the extent that a code of honor is reflexive in the sense used by a Demeter.
[00:19:18] It is so inflexible thereby leading on occasions to behavior that is so irrational as to
[00:19:22] burr on the absurd.
[00:19:24] That makes sense.
[00:19:25] There are sometimes where people have done stuff that does it make sense.
[00:19:29] It doesn't make sense.
[00:19:30] What they're doing.
[00:19:31] That's not going to be a good way to do it.
[00:19:32] But it doesn't make sense.
[00:19:33] And it's not even good.
[00:19:37] The following example illustrates the juxtaposition of bull and honor.
[00:19:41] The year was 1755.
[00:19:43] General Braddock set out with his two regiments, the 44th and the 48th and 600 irregular
[00:19:47] on a march to fort.
[00:19:53] Deca Seney.
[00:19:55] About nine miles from it, he was ambushed by Indians led by French officers.
[00:19:59] The result was disastrous.
[00:20:01] The men in their scarlet uniforms and white spatter dashes marching in columns where the
[00:20:07] sort of target ambush forces dream of.
[00:20:11] The Amican imaginers here come the literal British red coats.
[00:20:15] Here they come marching in columns and they can ambush by the French and the Indians.
[00:20:20] Helpless because they could not see their enemies.
[00:20:23] Some of the British troops broke for cover and fired from behind trees.
[00:20:28] Okay.
[00:20:29] Cool.
[00:20:29] This appalled Braddock and his officers, they considered scolicking behind trees both
[00:20:36] undisciplined and unsolgedly so they drove the Tommy's back into columns.
[00:20:42] Where, of course, they were butchered.
[00:20:46] The whole episode was glaring proof that neither leaders nor the system under which they
[00:20:49] operated were worthy of the troops they used.
[00:20:52] But that's like crazy, right?
[00:20:55] That's crazy.
[00:20:59] What I'm thinking about was that there's another example.
[00:21:01] So I'm thinking about was that that Japanese soldiers would ever surrender to the enemy
[00:21:05] that they were not instructed as to how they should comport themselves as they did.
[00:21:09] As a consequence, Japanese POWs were relatively fruitful source of information for Allied
[00:21:14] interrogators.
[00:21:15] I never thought about that because I've always heard that when the Japanese got captured they
[00:21:18] would like spill their guts but I never thought about why it's because they never got
[00:21:20] any training.
[00:21:21] There's like, oh, you will just die.
[00:21:23] No one's going to surrender.
[00:21:24] Well, actually we're going to surrender when this bill are guts.
[00:21:30] Fast forward a little bit.
[00:21:31] Talking about this snob situation, snob.
[00:21:36] Such a good word.
[00:21:38] A snob is one who is impressed by and therefore tries to identify with those who are higher
[00:21:43] up in the socio-economic scale while straining to disassociate himself from those lower
[00:21:48] down.
[00:21:50] By these lights, such everyday affections as name dropping and paying society magazine
[00:21:56] to publish photographs of oneself or one's nearest family are obvious examples of snob-ish
[00:22:03] nish.
[00:22:05] Name dropping.
[00:22:06] We know Echo's big on that one.
[00:22:09] I get these, one of they called chain emails.
[00:22:13] No, not a chain email like an automatic email.
[00:22:15] Yeah.
[00:22:16] Spam emails, right?
[00:22:17] It'll say, congratulations, Jaco Willink.
[00:22:20] You have been named as CEO of the year or as entrepreneur of the year or of entrepreneur
[00:22:26] of the decade and we, you know, congratulations.
[00:22:30] This is an incredible thing.
[00:22:33] And we would want to send you the full magazine that you will be published in along with
[00:22:38] a plaque recognizing your incredible achievements as a business leader.
[00:22:45] And the cost is over $11,399.
[00:22:48] And it's kind of funny, right?
[00:22:50] But then you got to remember, man, I've been to some people's offices when I got some
[00:22:53] plaque on the walls and now I know where they come from.
[00:22:57] Now I know where they come from.
[00:23:01] As a general role, snobbish behavior betoken some underlying feeling of inferiority.
[00:23:06] It is a common characteristic of the social climber of the individual with low self-esteem
[00:23:11] of the person who feels threatened or persecuted because of some real or imagined in
[00:23:16] inadequacy.
[00:23:17] So when you deal with someone that's a snob, they actually are feeling inferior.
[00:23:20] That there is an underlying pathology to the condition seems fairly obvious for two
[00:23:24] reasons.
[00:23:25] Firstly, those who are emotionally secure are rarely snobbish.
[00:23:31] Isn't that a nice thing to know and understand if you're emotionally secure, you're
[00:23:35] not going to be a snob?
[00:23:37] Secondly, the behavior is itself irrational, compulsive, and self-defeating.
[00:23:43] After all, even the most hardened snob must know that other people are adept at seeing
[00:23:49] through his affections.
[00:23:51] So you're going to act that way, you know people, because I explained this all the time
[00:23:55] to clients and at the most, I usually have to spend some time on this.
[00:23:59] Everyone can see what you're thinking.
[00:24:01] Your intent has a smell.
[00:24:03] It's so obvious.
[00:24:05] And you know it.
[00:24:06] And you deep down, you know it.
[00:24:09] Sometimes it's shocking, though, because I don't think people do know it.
[00:24:12] I think I agree with that.
[00:24:13] No, I mean, to what he's saying, right?
[00:24:15] Oh, he's saying that unless I'm hearing you incorrectly, he's saying that deep down, you
[00:24:22] know that behavior is observed by other people.
[00:24:26] And to me, that that's what makes the behavior crazy is the willingness to have that
[00:24:32] thought and go, no, no, I can get away with this.
[00:24:34] You know, I can do this differently.
[00:24:37] I can see it in him super obvious.
[00:24:38] But when I do this, it's not going to come across the snobbish.
[00:24:41] Yeah.
[00:24:42] That's the part for me.
[00:24:43] It's like that's crazy to think that you can pull it off.
[00:24:45] That is that is crazy.
[00:24:47] And I see that all the time.
[00:24:49] All the people think they're so smart.
[00:24:52] Think no one's noticing these little maneuvers.
[00:24:54] They're making it so obvious.
[00:24:56] Yes, so remember when we went on a little, we were talking about it a lot for some reason.
[00:25:04] And so I thought about it.
[00:25:05] And I don't think it's the kind of where they think I'm getting away with it.
[00:25:09] I don't think that's the thought.
[00:25:10] I think the thought is like, they're paying attention to what they're saying and all this
[00:25:15] stuff.
[00:25:16] But in their mind, instead of, oh, I look snobby and dumb or whatever that I'm doing this
[00:25:19] name drop in and all that, they don't think that.
[00:25:21] They think, oh, when I name drop, these people are going to think that I'm as cool as I'm
[00:25:26] trying to be.
[00:25:27] It's going to work.
[00:25:28] Yeah.
[00:25:29] But today's point, they see someone else name drop.
[00:25:31] And they go, right, freaking echoes over there trying to name drop.
[00:25:35] Yeah.
[00:25:36] Oh, yeah.
[00:25:37] It's like, but there's a little hints of that way of backwards thinking where it applies
[00:25:41] everyone else to not me, right?
[00:25:42] I'm super paranoid about that.
[00:25:44] Bro, and that's a good quality because then it, you know, the kind, it's a old joke
[00:25:49] where people give great relationship advice, right?
[00:25:53] They think they give such good relationship advice, but everyone's like, you don't have
[00:25:56] any good relationships.
[00:25:57] You know, that kind, you know, right?
[00:25:59] So it's kind of everywhere where we think that it applies to everyone else and doesn't
[00:26:05] apply to me or it applies to me and no one else or whatever.
[00:26:08] And that's what Dave says.
[00:26:09] Yeah.
[00:26:10] It's like, oh, this, I can, I can name drop.
[00:26:14] Yes.
[00:26:15] And it's pretty cool.
[00:26:16] Effective, exactly.
[00:26:17] So yeah.
[00:26:18] But they see someone else doing it.
[00:26:19] They're like, yeah, make sure.
[00:26:20] Or even the snob, you, I know some snops.
[00:26:22] Unfortunately.
[00:26:23] And I get the same impression kind of like, right?
[00:26:26] Because snob's special when they're behaving in a snobby way, it looks dumb.
[00:26:30] Like, it's kind of embarrassing, especially if you know the person in like, I'm even a
[00:26:33] little bit.
[00:26:34] It's kind of embarrassing.
[00:26:35] Like, you wish they wouldn't for their sake act like that.
[00:26:38] But you can tell they think, oh my gosh, these people must be so impressed with my,
[00:26:42] with my standards.
[00:26:43] You know, my high standards.
[00:26:44] Speaking of just brand me, males, I get these, I get invites to podcasts.
[00:26:50] Yeah.
[00:26:51] Hell yeah.
[00:26:52] And the podcast invite will say, you don't recently had this person.
[00:26:56] It's just literally just a list of name dropping stuff.
[00:27:01] And I think to myself, bro, what are you doing?
[00:27:04] Tell me about, you know, what your podcast is about.
[00:27:07] It's, they didn't even play around.
[00:27:08] They're just like, have this person this person, this person, this person, this person,
[00:27:11] this person.
[00:27:12] You think, man.
[00:27:13] Yeah, they think it was a little game too.
[00:27:15] There's a little status.
[00:27:17] You know, they're one of that.
[00:27:18] They can get you on.
[00:27:19] Then they could get this person on.
[00:27:21] Then they're listing you at every freaking chance.
[00:27:23] They got that.
[00:27:24] Yeah.
[00:27:25] Yeah.
[00:27:26] It's freaking savagery in the freaking podcast zone.
[00:27:29] That's the book.
[00:27:33] There is nothing, for example, quite so transparent as name dropping or displaying invitations.
[00:27:40] He must know it's some level of this behavior provokes at best amusement at worst ridicule,
[00:27:45] contempt or even dislike.
[00:27:47] But he is nonetheless powerless to curb his snobbishness.
[00:27:51] Something drives him on.
[00:27:53] I like that.
[00:27:54] I like the way it takes, like, you have to drive through it.
[00:27:59] But why should the military be snobbish?
[00:28:03] Firstly, because traditionally top levels of the military hierarchy were occupied by the
[00:28:07] rich and highly borne, the notions of socioeconomic and military status came.
[00:28:12] It just became completely related.
[00:28:17] Then it goes on to say, officers are also stressed from within to know that they have
[00:28:23] wedded their lives to essentially destructive ends, that they should, that they shoulder
[00:28:28] great responsibilities, that they may be called upon to carry out tasks far beyond their
[00:28:33] capabilities and that the price of failure is enormous, is quite sufficient to initiate
[00:28:38] feelings of uneasiness.
[00:28:42] Even notions of retirement are fraught with stress.
[00:28:45] The knowledge that most ex-officeers have little value on the civilian labor market, that
[00:28:51] there are a lot of total obscurity of gential poverty that they only, that only the very
[00:28:57] best and very worst of full generals and above are likely to achieve immortality and that none
[00:29:03] of them will ever again command the absolute obedience to which they have grown accustomed
[00:29:09] that can hardly be described as reassuring.
[00:29:14] That's kind of crazy, right?
[00:29:15] You're in the military, you're an officer, you get out, people are looking.
[00:29:19] You think you're the still man, ain't happened.
[00:29:24] To the factors underlying the self-protective and compensating aspects of snobbish,
[00:29:30] snobbishness must be added what is perhaps the most important one of all pre-existing doubts
[00:29:36] of the self.
[00:29:38] Since, as we noted earlier, there is much in militarism to attract those without
[00:29:42] about their masculinity and intellectual capacity, it would not be surprising to find that
[00:29:48] a number of men with problems over self-esteem will be discovered at all levels of the military
[00:29:54] hierarchy.
[00:29:55] Why do we have a bunch of snobbs?
[00:29:57] Well, because they're insecure about who they are.
[00:30:01] One piece of corroborative evidence for these views comes from yet another characteristic
[00:30:05] of many military organizations.
[00:30:09] Their notorious sensitivity to criticism.
[00:30:12] People don't like to be criticized.
[00:30:16] They're not as far to talk about little bit in talking of criticism.
[00:30:18] It might seem that we are making a great deal of fuss about nothing.
[00:30:22] After all, nobody likes criticism.
[00:30:24] And as far and as for complaints against military historians, it is only natural, indeed
[00:30:29] audible that some show loyalty to one's group, because he had gone on to a little thing
[00:30:32] about how some mismilitary historians don't say anything bad about leaders from the military.
[00:30:40] But he said, you know, he said, that's understandable because they kind of have a little
[00:30:45] bit of hero worship going on.
[00:30:47] But he goes on to say, there are some special features of the phenomenon in some military
[00:30:52] men which deserve attention.
[00:30:53] In the first place, their sensitivity seems out of all proportion to that of other public
[00:31:00] figures.
[00:31:01] In terms of fame or notoriety, well-known generals or admirals are on the level with film
[00:31:06] stars, politicians, and even newsworthy academics.
[00:31:10] It's one would expect that they might come to accept the possibility of negative publicity
[00:31:16] as part of the game, a small price to pay, for the perks which they otherwise enjoy.
[00:31:22] This they seem unable to do.
[00:31:24] In fact, there is a distinctly paranoid element in the way some senior commanders have
[00:31:28] reacted to even the faintest breath of criticism.
[00:31:31] To the vaguest and most tactful suspicion of a raised eyebrow are cleared throat, almost
[00:31:36] as if they were being held personally responsible for everything that might go wrong.
[00:31:46] By the way, you should be held for a lot of irony.
[00:31:51] There's a lot of irony in that one.
[00:31:53] You get these people that are insecure and they end up being snobbs.
[00:32:00] He closes out this section saying, in touching upon this delicate matter, we must not lose
[00:32:04] sight of this evidence significance and relevance in the present context.
[00:32:09] Whatever else it may be, sensitivity to criticism is a measure of insecurity.
[00:32:16] That's so important to remember.
[00:32:18] You look like so insecure when you get offended by criticism.
[00:32:26] In implies a weak ego, which in turn, by way of compensation manifests itself in particular
[00:32:31] character traits, one of which is snobbishness.
[00:32:35] Whether this ego weakness is due to some early shock to self-esteem or fear of the
[00:32:40] breakthrough of unacceptable impulses or some combination of the two influences, the individual
[00:32:45] so afflicted, develop certain defenses which help to minimize his painful feelings.
[00:32:50] This fine support and yet another feature of military organizations, their cults of anti-affemination.
[00:32:56] It's going into our next chapter, anti-affemination.
[00:33:04] We don't want to be feminine.
[00:33:06] We want to be masculine.
[00:33:08] It says there's a quote in here from General Chaffey.
[00:33:12] Let war cease altogether and a nation will become a feminine.
[00:33:16] We just need war.
[00:33:20] He goes here saying, when discussing the various anxieties which militarism serves to reduce
[00:33:26] brief mention was made of the fears which some men entertain about their masculinity.
[00:33:33] This thus, it was pointed out that though primarily concerned with combating the dread
[00:33:39] of disorder and dissolution, certain setorial aspects of bullshit might also help to reassure
[00:33:46] those with problems in this area.
[00:33:50] They say in there, they impose discipline because you're anti-feminist.
[00:33:57] Ampty, feminine, feminists, feminists, feminine or feminists.
[00:34:07] And that some of these, you know, imposing your will on people means you're not like
[00:34:17] a feminine.
[00:34:20] Are we getting into the kind of the weird zone of this book a little bit?
[00:34:26] He says, in putting together the jigsaw of military incompetence, therefore we now, we
[00:34:30] can now take up a piece, one piece which clearly has great relevance to the topic.
[00:34:36] The striking of version towards a feminacy which characterizes some military organizations
[00:34:41] and this despite the fact that the female is usually regarded as, quote, more deadly than
[00:34:47] the male.
[00:34:48] Okay, so I had to, I don't know, this was written in 1976.
[00:34:52] Obviously this is a topic that might be addressed differently today but what I did want
[00:34:57] to do, what I did look up is I said, okay, what is a feminine characteristic and what
[00:35:01] is a masculine character and a characteristic, generally speaking.
[00:35:07] Now, okay, I'll just go to read them first.
[00:35:10] And this is coming from some website about psychology, right?
[00:35:14] Masculine strong controlled focused powerful centered purpose driven loves a challenge
[00:35:19] and competition single task oriented problem solver wants freedom and release makes big
[00:35:25] things small.
[00:35:27] Forgets needs admiration and appreciation wants to be needed and respected.
[00:35:33] They're the masculine intimacy killer is being criticized controlled or shut out.
[00:35:39] So those are the masculine characteristics.
[00:35:44] Here's the feminine characteristics.
[00:35:46] Free flowing open radiance.
[00:35:50] Wild, destructive, emotion driven seeks and gives love, nurtureer, multitasker, diffused
[00:35:59] awareness wants to gather, talk, vent, makes small things big.
[00:36:08] Members needs reassurance and attention wants trust connection and praise.
[00:36:15] The intimacy killer is feeling unseen, unsafe or misunderstood.
[00:36:19] Now, clearly these things every human has both these things in a spectrum and you could
[00:36:29] call, you didn't need, I think what makes them challenging to talk about in this day and
[00:36:33] age they put man and woman on them, what they should have done is said, just black and white
[00:36:41] to do.
[00:36:42] Yeah, yng and yng would have been perfect.
[00:36:45] You got the yng personality, you got the Yng personality.
[00:36:48] Here's how they are not necessarily men and women because let's face it.
[00:36:50] We know a lot of women that are strong controlled and focused, we know a lot of men that
[00:36:54] are free flowing open radiance, right?
[00:36:57] But I think they're generally speaking psychologically here some characteristics.
[00:37:01] So that's where we're at.
[00:37:03] Dave, are you concerned yet?
[00:37:04] Is this the freaking podcast that gets us banned finally?
[00:37:10] I don't know.
[00:37:11] No, I'm concerned at the depth that this guy is going into to explain what I think is
[00:37:16] going to be a series of behaviors that we're going to discuss that are really deep.
[00:37:20] Yes, it's interesting because what he's saying is and what he says is that the military
[00:37:28] can shut out these feminine characteristics and that's not good.
[00:37:32] Yeah.
[00:37:33] That's what he's about to say.
[00:37:34] Yeah.
[00:37:35] One of the negative characteristics of a militaristic organization is that it doesn't
[00:37:40] have enough of the feminine characteristics, for instance, free and open mind.
[00:37:46] Right?
[00:37:47] Those are bad.
[00:37:48] If you don't have those, you're in a bad situation.
[00:37:52] So he goes on to say evidence of this aversion is of necessity, circumstantial.
[00:38:00] He didn't brace it such a phenomenal.
[00:38:01] So here's some things that kind of show maybe this anti-affeminate role that you have
[00:38:08] in the military.
[00:38:10] One of the important to attach to such outward signs of sexual identification as hair length.
[00:38:17] Just the insistence on short back and sides seems correlated with those periods in history
[00:38:23] when sexual differentiation was linked to hair length.
[00:38:27] We can dismiss excuses of neatness and hygiene as rationalizations.
[00:38:32] Field Marshal Lord Wolsey stated the true case when he said it is very difficult to make
[00:38:38] an Englishman at any time look like a soldier.
[00:38:41] He is fond of his longish hair, hair is the glory of a woman but the shame of a man.
[00:38:52] So what he's saying is listen, it's not about hygiene, it's not about convenience, which
[00:38:58] by the way, I totally disagree with this.
[00:39:00] I think having short hair is totally convenient, low maintenance, hygienic, neat.
[00:39:09] That's why I have the hair that I have.
[00:39:11] When my hair gets longer than three quarters of an inch, which has been for a long time,
[00:39:16] I can't stand it.
[00:39:18] I don't think I can look at a woman, I need to shave my head right now, not even in the
[00:39:23] ballpark.
[00:39:24] Dude, I think he's stretching here.
[00:39:26] I think he's doing a stretch.
[00:39:28] In fact, the other thing is how do you bring uniformity to a person's hair?
[00:39:36] You cut it off.
[00:39:37] Otherwise, you have some dude with long red hair, you got some other dude with curly
[00:39:41] hair, you got another dude with no hair, you got all these different hair styles.
[00:39:47] And now, the sun, we look different.
[00:39:49] We're not trying to look different.
[00:39:50] And you know how like when people grow old, they have like longer hair and it starts
[00:39:55] to go in front of their face and they go with it back with their head.
[00:39:58] That's a functionality thing, I get it, but it looks pretty feminine.
[00:40:02] Okay.
[00:40:03] What about when you see a fighter, a professional fighter in the ultimate fighting championship,
[00:40:09] and he has to adjust his hair while he's fighting, by the way.
[00:40:12] Same kick, right?
[00:40:13] Same kick, it doesn't make him any less on the fighter, but then I get technically
[00:40:17] right, you got to do one more step for efficiency or whatever I guess, but you know,
[00:40:22] isn't that a sexual thing when girls do that, flip their hair?
[00:40:25] That's like a mating thing, right?
[00:40:27] I was just gonna play a great way to watch in that dude fight.
[00:40:30] And they're like, bro, how do you see?
[00:40:32] And he's constantly messing with his hair and it doesn't seem to affect him on that
[00:40:34] much.
[00:40:35] That's true.
[00:40:36] And his hair was so freaking wild.
[00:40:37] It was almost like a target disruptor.
[00:40:40] Like they see his hair would be moving around.
[00:40:42] Same thing with big ass beards.
[00:40:44] Like how does that not throw off your punch to someone's chin when they've got a beard,
[00:40:50] a big beard.
[00:40:51] That's a problem.
[00:40:52] I don't know if this is true, but I distinctly remember being told, and I don't even
[00:40:57] know who told me, but you're hair, the one of the reasons they talked about you're
[00:41:01] hair being short is they don't want somebody to be able to use your hair as a way
[00:41:04] to manipulate your head during hand-hand combat.
[00:41:06] Freaking on your head and you know, so I don't know that being like in a regulation
[00:41:10] as the explanation, but being told, hey, if the guy can grab your hair and pull your
[00:41:14] head because your hair's too long, you're wrong.
[00:41:16] That's the puts you into disadvantage.
[00:41:17] You can't do that.
[00:41:19] So 100% my, I've always, my role was this my role of me, but I will say, I kind of
[00:41:26] talked to my son about this and however, maybe I'm wrong, didn't really tell my daughters
[00:41:30] this.
[00:41:31] I said, hey, if your hair is long enough for someone to grab, then that's a problem.
[00:41:35] You don't want to have hair that's long enough for someone to grab.
[00:41:37] I told that to my son.
[00:41:39] I didn't, I might have told to my daughters, but I didn't enforce it.
[00:41:42] Right?
[00:41:43] So I guess I'm whatever, what is that?
[00:41:49] Sex is?
[00:41:50] Yeah.
[00:41:51] No, you know, sex is, but you know, what is it when you treat someone different?
[00:41:55] Right?
[00:41:56] You discriminate a little bit.
[00:41:57] Yeah, whatever.
[00:41:58] Although I've told, I told all my daughters, like, hey, I can take care of this problem.
[00:42:02] We can shave that head. I always offer my daughters haircuts.
[00:42:06] They've never said yes.
[00:42:07] Yeah, I say it as a joke.
[00:42:09] I don't know if I don't want to shave my daughter's head, but I told my son the same thing.
[00:42:14] I was like, yeah, you do want it short.
[00:42:15] Yeah.
[00:42:16] So when you get in a fight or whatever, they can't grab your head or the hair like that.
[00:42:19] Oh, that's what is double standard.
[00:42:22] I had the double standard.
[00:42:24] Sure.
[00:42:25] Although I didn't, I gave them the job.
[00:42:26] Yeah, but you didn't enforce it, though.
[00:42:28] Wait, did you enforce it with your son, though?
[00:42:30] No, but I mean, it kind of makes sense.
[00:42:32] Hey, so it's for as your role and your level of enforcement, it was the same.
[00:42:36] Oh, hey, how they behave.
[00:42:37] That's different.
[00:42:38] They got different lights.
[00:42:39] I get it.
[00:42:40] I kind of thought I might get my middle, when my middle daughter was wrestling.
[00:42:44] You know, and going into some freaking savagery.
[00:42:47] Yeah, they don't have a lot of wrestling, though.
[00:42:49] Or they do.
[00:42:50] No, they don't.
[00:42:51] But still, let's face it for principle.
[00:42:52] Let's face it.
[00:42:53] You roll it.
[00:42:54] Your female wrestler and you roll it with the shit.
[00:42:55] It's kind of like, fuck rose.
[00:42:56] Right?
[00:42:57] Yep.
[00:42:58] We're not looking at fuck rose thinking hell.
[00:42:59] Yeah.
[00:43:00] We are.
[00:43:01] Yeah.
[00:43:02] Yeah.
[00:43:03] Even her opponent.
[00:43:04] Yeah.
[00:43:05] She's a professional.
[00:43:06] Yeah.
[00:43:07] She's never had shame the first time.
[00:43:09] But you know, my daughter would get the cornbreads, like the real tight braids.
[00:43:14] That's kind of a war mode to this.
[00:43:16] You can't grab those, by the way.
[00:43:18] Yeah, I mean, in the back.
[00:43:19] Yeah, well, if you have some kind of a ponytail sticking out the back, but for some
[00:43:23] of my daughter, they don't have that.
[00:43:24] They would just tight.
[00:43:25] Interesting.
[00:43:26] Well, does.
[00:43:27] Well, is it the same for beard, though?
[00:43:28] Like a big beard?
[00:43:29] Totally.
[00:43:30] Like you can grab the beard.
[00:43:31] Yeah.
[00:43:32] If I'm going to be like, it's the exact same thing.
[00:43:34] I look at someone with a big beard, I think.
[00:43:36] Handle.
[00:43:37] You must be super, super double extra confident to think that someone's not going to
[00:43:41] regain a wrist wrap on that bad boy.
[00:43:43] It's slam your head in the pavement.
[00:43:45] Right.
[00:43:46] Well, I feel like the beard is in a less opportune position, I guess.
[00:43:53] Technically, still very useful.
[00:43:54] Yeah.
[00:43:55] Very useful.
[00:43:56] But, you know, on the top of the head, that's like, I'd say there's like a good level
[00:44:00] or two more control.
[00:44:01] Yeah.
[00:44:02] It's very shocking when I see guys in front here.
[00:44:05] Again, you must have a lot of confidence that someone's not going to grab you.
[00:44:09] And that's one of my favorite takedowns on the battlefield.
[00:44:11] Just grab a handful of hair and slam people down.
[00:44:14] It works good.
[00:44:15] Bro, what's the girl fights on YouTube?
[00:44:17] Oh.
[00:44:18] If you have the time, bro, that's going to be the default at some point.
[00:44:21] They're just going to grab hair.
[00:44:22] And it's like they kind of nullify both attacks.
[00:44:24] Yeah.
[00:44:25] When they're both grabbing hair.
[00:44:26] So it's man.
[00:44:27] It's like proof.
[00:44:28] You know, in the field.
[00:44:29] Yeah.
[00:44:30] It's a very, very drug-check scrapping it out on YouTube.
[00:44:34] It's totally true.
[00:44:35] It's totally true.
[00:44:36] Okay.
[00:44:37] This is a rough topic.
[00:44:39] Traditional taboos on certain topics and pastimes.
[00:44:44] Thus we find Captain Foley, commander of Britannia Naval Training Establishment for Officer
[00:44:51] Cadets at Dartmouth for bidding piano playing because he considered an effeminate.
[00:44:58] So these are the kind of dudes that are weird, right?
[00:44:59] This dude's got issues.
[00:45:02] And he's going hard against piano playing because he's got some weird stuff going on.
[00:45:05] Yeah, right?
[00:45:06] Yeah.
[00:45:07] Another one a deeply rooted prejudice toward women who try to adopt traditional
[00:45:12] male roles.
[00:45:14] See that?
[00:45:16] Finally an equation between defensive behavior and defemination.
[00:45:21] So if you're on defense, that means you're being effeminate.
[00:45:25] The feeling that it is scissy to wear ear protectors or build head covers has undoubtedly
[00:45:33] caused much undecisert unnecessary destruction of the human body.
[00:45:39] It is not an unreasonable hypothesis to suggest that it's most glaring and costly illustration
[00:45:44] occurred in connection with the issue of convoys.
[00:45:47] In the first World War, hundreds of thousands of tons of merchant shipping was lost through
[00:45:51] the Navy's refusal to adopt the convoys system.
[00:45:56] When Lloyd George eventually forced convoys upon an unwilling admiralty, losses fell
[00:46:03] significantly.
[00:46:04] So their idea was, hey, I'm charging my ship.
[00:46:07] I'm not going to go with a pack, not weak.
[00:46:10] I'm not going into convoys.
[00:46:12] That's weak.
[00:46:13] I'm a man and I'm going to take this thing so low.
[00:46:16] And they were losing ships all the time.
[00:46:18] Finally someone's ate, bro.
[00:46:19] You guys got to stick together.
[00:46:21] The lesson was plain for all to see.
[00:46:24] But in the years between the wars, the same irrational dislike of mothering a flock of ships
[00:46:31] prevented the development of an efficient escort system.
[00:46:36] So the brits started taking losses in World War I.
[00:46:40] World War II, same freaking bad move.
[00:46:43] Then America entered the war and unbelievably in the face of overwhelming evidence insisted
[00:46:48] on trying to defeat you, you boats without the use of convoys, same thing.
[00:46:53] This is World War II.
[00:46:54] We already know that you should stick together.
[00:46:58] Between December 1941 and the following March, American losses of merchant shipping grew
[00:47:03] to the staggering monthly total of 500,000 tons.
[00:47:08] Eventually the price of aggressive masculinity embodied in the so-called patrol and hunting
[00:47:12] operations of isolated warships proved too costly.
[00:47:17] And convoys were instituted between Boston and Halifax.
[00:47:21] Losses on this route promptly dropped to zero.
[00:47:26] But South of Boston's ship still sailed independently until June of the number of ships
[00:47:31] sunk reaching all time record of 700,000 tons in a single month.
[00:47:35] They still didn't do it.
[00:47:37] Considered week, it's considered feminine.
[00:47:40] That's the, okay, hindsight 2020, again it.
[00:47:44] But when you kind of think of the big picture, it makes more sense than it might appear
[00:47:50] at first.
[00:47:51] Because remember back in the day when seat belts weren't what you call legal.
[00:47:55] Or it was legal still to not receive belt.
[00:47:58] Then there's like, and then there's a little transition period where it's like, yeah, if
[00:48:02] you know where your seat belts kind of like, ah, like what you scared, like kind of weaker
[00:48:05] whatever.
[00:48:06] Same thing with the kids and the helmets.
[00:48:08] Like, oh yeah, you're just riding in the cold of secret now.
[00:48:11] Brad, the helmet is that even necessary?
[00:48:13] Or you see the kids with the elbow pads, you know, it's kind of like, okay, cool, you're
[00:48:18] safe, but come on, let's say that's kind of weak, you know.
[00:48:22] But the truth is, bro, if you care about like the safety or whether it be efficiency,
[00:48:29] safety, not dying, like all these things, brother, helmet's going to make a lot of sense.
[00:48:34] Right.
[00:48:35] After a while, you're going to kind of realize that then it's like, okay, what's more
[00:48:38] cool now, living or not wearing that helmet?
[00:48:42] Yep.
[00:48:43] Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:48:46] That's, sorry, see, I see, we're just staying in the mind is what I'm saying.
[00:48:49] So it took these guys a little while to get over the state of mind, like, hey, we kind
[00:48:52] of look like a sissy.
[00:48:53] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:48:54] Because of we're going in a con.
[00:48:57] Yeah, I don't even know, but he holding my hand.
[00:48:59] Yeah, you know, I got this.
[00:49:00] Like, yeah.
[00:49:01] All right, good.
[00:49:02] Did any of your dudes not want to wear eye pro?
[00:49:05] Remember, eye pro, those clear in what situation?
[00:49:08] It was like going out and literally going out on a mission.
[00:49:11] Yeah, me.
[00:49:12] Shut up.
[00:49:13] I don't say why it had nothing to do with, if, depending on how much movement was taken
[00:49:20] place, it was like, oh, I'm just kidding.
[00:49:22] It was like, that's what a lot.
[00:49:24] And they would be not.
[00:49:25] They wouldn't be functional for me.
[00:49:27] That's that is a, that's a legitimate reason to do to close the aisle of
[00:49:32] like a sissy.
[00:49:33] Yeah, that's a legitimate reason to do to close the aisle of like a sissy.
[00:49:33] Yeah, that's a legitimate reason to do to close the aisle of like a sissy.
[00:49:35] You could wear eye pro, you should, if you can, you should.
[00:49:38] Yeah.
[00:49:39] And I only asked that because I remember that being a, like, long conversation with,
[00:49:44] with folks, not just on my team, but all the people who were with about not wearing
[00:49:49] eye pro out on missions, not the fogging and the sweat of that was standing, which I fully
[00:49:53] understandable and there's different ways, different ones to do it and do, didn't want
[00:49:56] to do it because they didn't like the way it looked.
[00:49:58] Mm.
[00:49:59] Really?
[00:50:00] Well, all you had to do is authorize me where freaking sunglasses, they said, okay, get them.
[00:50:03] They'll fuck their teeth.
[00:50:04] Yeah.
[00:50:05] It's weird though because I always wear sunglasses.
[00:50:08] Always.
[00:50:09] Always wear sunglasses, but I never wore sunglasses in the field ever.
[00:50:13] And I don't know.
[00:50:14] I didn't seem like just in the way plus they would fog up, they would get sweaty.
[00:50:18] Yeah.
[00:50:19] Is there anything in, I guess in the battlefield, it might be more black and white, but
[00:50:24] like in training or something like that where it's like maybe something optional or
[00:50:29] something that people don't want to wear or do that's for safety reasons, but it's like,
[00:50:34] it's like, it's not cool or it's like, you would ever sweat like that.
[00:50:37] There's a ton of things.
[00:50:39] In aviation gloves, they're always a big one.
[00:50:40] Gloves, yeah.
[00:50:41] Do's in one of where gloves.
[00:50:44] And then they'd always show like these videos of like post-dejection trauma to your hands
[00:50:48] or fingers getting literally, they'd call it getting declerved when your skin would come
[00:50:54] off your hand and leave the bone behind that pictures of guys exiting the cockpit on
[00:50:59] ejections and stuff or getting burn and things like that.
[00:51:02] So, like, gloves would stop you from getting declerved.
[00:51:05] Yes.
[00:51:06] So, if you have like a ring or a or your climate up or something like that and you didn't
[00:51:14] have something covering that that could get caught, there's a famous picture, all the
[00:51:18] any avian are listening to this will no exactly what I'm talking with.
[00:51:20] There's a famous picture like the Gazette or whatever a magazine of a dude hand on the
[00:51:24] table like this who's wearing his wedding ring and his hands there, this whole thing
[00:51:28] has gone all this errors is the remaining piece of bone left on his hand, you know,
[00:51:33] trying to get people to wear gloves.
[00:51:35] People didn't want to wear gloves.
[00:51:36] Did you wear a wedding ring?
[00:51:38] Yes.
[00:51:39] I'll do your gloves.
[00:51:40] Yes.
[00:51:41] Did you always wear gloves?
[00:51:42] Yes, I was a glove wearer.
[00:51:45] And then why would you not want to wear gloves?
[00:51:48] The complaint was like, oh, it's the tactile like I want to press the buttons and turn
[00:51:51] the knobs and it's harder to feel and like, can you know, can you cut the fingertips
[00:51:54] off?
[00:51:55] Yes.
[00:51:56] Did you do that?
[00:51:57] No.
[00:51:58] Now what would eventually happen is like you'd wear through them and sometimes the
[00:52:01] fingers would actually you probably even see them in the videos.
[00:52:03] I'm like, move them my things up and down and the gloves are kind of afraid and whatnot.
[00:52:07] But it was just to your point.
[00:52:08] It was a conversation that I was found odd to be quite honest.
[00:52:12] The reason I wore gloves is like the first day of light school that guy was like, you
[00:52:15] will wear your gloves and like, okay, Roger that.
[00:52:17] No, I'm not here to like, I used to it.
[00:52:19] I'm not here to like tell you, I don't like the way it feels.
[00:52:21] I didn't even think about it.
[00:52:22] Put my gloves on and strap them on and that was the end of that.
[00:52:26] I never found my own style.
[00:52:28] I have to like, you know, I don't like this.
[00:52:31] Wasn't in my I didn't, I wasn't in care or think about those things.
[00:52:34] And you got used to it totally.
[00:52:35] I want you to get used to it.
[00:52:36] It doesn't really go.
[00:52:37] It's no factor.
[00:52:38] Yeah, it's no factor at all.
[00:52:39] But there are people that these are conversations and think to the point is like, those
[00:52:43] conversations about I'm not wearing this for the functionality versus I don't like the
[00:52:47] way it looks.
[00:52:48] Those are two totally different things.
[00:52:49] You tell me, hey, get's fogged up.
[00:52:50] I can't see sweat.
[00:52:51] I remember sweat being drawn and down the glass and like these are gone immediately.
[00:52:55] This is as I look in the mirror, my all I'm all kitted up about to go, I don't like the
[00:52:59] way I look.
[00:53:00] I'm not having those conversations in my mind about how I look when I'm doing this.
[00:53:04] Yeah, well, the fact of knowing you can get your freaking strap in your eyes, you know,
[00:53:10] little chunks of brass in your eyes, little chunks of crap in your eyes.
[00:53:13] Like that sucks.
[00:53:14] Especially Dave Burke, who has a hundred percent plan of going back to flying an airplane
[00:53:18] with his whole ground situation as over.
[00:53:20] You were like, I'm a person for my eyes.
[00:53:22] I was never one-protected.
[00:53:28] So he goes on to this section here where he starts to use this term, butch.
[00:53:35] And it's not, it's just basically saying like, I guess we would say like hyper, manly, like
[00:53:41] a manly man, he uses this term butch.
[00:53:44] He says by selecting and promoting on the basis of such blutch criteria as size, strength,
[00:53:51] physical courage and prowess at games, the armed forces tend to ignore other attributes,
[00:53:56] which really may be of even greater importance to a senior commander, intelligence,
[00:54:01] high educational level, resistance to breakdown under stress, and substantial reserves of moral
[00:54:06] courage. Well, clearly this goes down where we're just picking the kind of the tough it's
[00:54:12] due to be in charge instead of the smartest dude. Not that the smartest dude is necessarily the
[00:54:17] right one either, because we see smart people that are really dumb. There is of course a counter
[00:54:24] argument, namely that generals should be heroic leaders, which would necessitate them having at
[00:54:29] least some of the aforementioned butch traits. Sheer physical size, the possession of decorations
[00:54:34] for bravery and a find or rugger record, would, according to this argument, confer invaluable leadership
[00:54:40] qualities upon top military commanders. Unhappily, this theory does not stand up, and by rugger,
[00:54:46] he means a rung be player. Being good at rugger, in no way ensures the best qualities of military
[00:54:53] leadership. So called masculine attributes count for very little in comparison with personality
[00:54:59] and knowing one's job. The most cursory glance at military history suggests that many of the
[00:55:08] really great military and naval commanders, Napoleon Nelson, Wholford instance, were men of
[00:55:13] brain and character, not of huge bodies with dazzling records in the field of sport.
[00:55:19] Of general ship Montgomery says the science and art of command involves an intimate knowledge
[00:55:25] of human nature. A commander must think two stages ahead. He speaks globally of the physical,
[00:55:32] physically frail wolf and Nelson, describing the latter as a brilliant semen and most original
[00:55:38] intelligent and courageous fighter. In the same vein, he comments on the flexibility and brilliant
[00:55:43] intellect of Napoleon. But nowhere does the field marshal talk about the advantages of fine
[00:55:49] physique, hairy masculinity and a reputation for long-distance running polo or boxing.
[00:55:56] So these manly traits, butch traits, according to this book, might not be the most important thing.
[00:56:03] In fact, he's indicating that they are not the most important thing. We are concerned to relate
[00:56:10] and explain to indisputable phenomenon. So called peaceful generals who in times of stress reveal
[00:56:16] themselves as passive, dependent and indecisive and the anti-affemination, ethos of some military
[00:56:24] organizations to handle these facts the following points were made.
[00:56:27] Some men, for reasons rooted in early family situation, have serious doubts about their
[00:56:35] sexual adequacy and or physical strength and size. Such men may deal with their feelings of inferiority
[00:56:43] by adopting a compensatory style of life in which they strive for reassurance in some
[00:56:49] suitably symbolic role. The prevailing ethos of many military organizations provides this reassurance
[00:56:57] hence a percentage of men will seek acceptance by the armed forces simply because such acceptance
[00:57:02] is a warranty of their masculinity. Once in their continuing and underlying feet of a fear
[00:57:10] of a feminacy produces that well-known pattern of behavior which we have termed butch.
[00:57:17] But this behavior itself is highly valued in the armed forces. Hence the individual not only
[00:57:24] profits by but also contributes to the anti-affemination of his parent organization,
[00:57:30] it is in his interest to do so. And last, the significance of all this for military and
[00:57:37] competence is that butch characteristics are not perhaps the most important criteria for top-level
[00:57:42] leadership. So he's talking about, when I was thinking about this, you definitely see some people
[00:57:49] like this where you can see that they're in the military to try and maybe compensate for some
[00:57:57] fears in their own head. And I think it's real obvious just like we talk the obviousness of
[00:58:02] someone that's a snob, someone that's a name dropper. Because let's face it, there's some guys in
[00:58:07] the military that are 100% badass military dudes and like that's just how they are.
[00:58:13] This idea that you get some people that are countering their innate
[00:58:21] feminine traits by just trying to act super tough. You see some of those guys, I don't think it's very
[00:58:26] widespread. You certainly see some of them, but it's not, it's not that common. When you see it,
[00:58:34] it's very obvious that that's what you're dealing with. They're usually over the top with their
[00:58:38] behavior. But then I think the most important thing that he's saying is that in the military,
[00:58:45] sometimes that you start to focus on that. We don't want someone that's going to raise their hand
[00:58:50] and have an open mind to stuff or going to, I mean, think about some of these feminine
[00:58:55] traits that are good, multitasker, wants to talk, communicate, remembers things, free, flowing,
[00:59:10] and open. A motion driven, we talk all the time about the fact that we don't want people to make
[00:59:16] emotional decisions, but you don't want someone that doesn't have any emotion, because that's how
[00:59:19] you end up with a commander that's just sending people to the other death. So to, well, that's
[00:59:25] why we wrote the dichotomy of leadership. All these myth mask that infeminent traits,
[00:59:30] you need them both. And you need to have balance. You need to have balance in the individuals,
[00:59:34] and then you need to have balance in a unit. You might have, you know, you're going to need some
[00:59:37] people in your platoon that just are killers. But if you have a whole platoon filled with killers,
[00:59:44] that's going to be a problem. And you need to have some people in your platoon that are very empathetic.
[00:59:50] But if you have a whole platoon of empathetic people, you're not going to be able to get
[00:59:53] any mission stuff. So you need a balance of these feminine and masculine traits. You need to have
[00:59:58] the proper balance of ying and ying. So where does toxic masculinity fit into all this? Or is this
[01:00:07] just talking about toxic, but since it was written back in, you know, before the term before the term,
[01:00:12] the toxic masculinity, I wrote an article about this one time. The toxic masculinity is when you take
[01:00:17] any of the considered traditional masculine traits and you take them to an extreme. And then you
[01:00:23] end up with someone that's, quote, toxic masculine. So here's the thing, when I wrote that article,
[01:00:30] I wrote about, because they were saying, you know, being competitive is a toxic masculine trait.
[01:00:35] No, it's not. It's a good trait to have. Being strong. That's a masculine trait. Is it toxic? No.
[01:00:44] Do what's another one? Um, being purpose driven. That's a masculine trait according to this list.
[01:00:53] Is that a bad thing? If you take it to an extreme, when you got someone that's they just want to
[01:00:58] win and then it's actually people, yeah, that's bad. If you want someone that wants to be just so
[01:01:02] strong and powerful that they'll just step on other people, that's bad. So if you take some of
[01:01:06] these things to extreme, they're a problem. And when I ended up saying in that article, there's these,
[01:01:12] these are good characteristics for for a person to have, including my three daughters. I want my
[01:01:19] daughters to be assertive. I want them to be strong. I want them to be competitive. What you want
[01:01:25] you don't want your daughters to be like that? No, of course. You want your sons to be like that,
[01:01:29] too. Do you want any of your kids to go too far in those directions? No, absolutely not.
[01:01:34] So the toxic masculinity, I think is when you start taking any of these characteristics to the
[01:01:40] extreme, it becomes a problem. Is that answer your question? Yeah, I'm wondering if this is
[01:01:46] essentially like what he's talking about before it was actually like a phrase. Yeah, and I think if
[01:01:51] you get an organization where they've gone too far in one direction, it's a problem. Yeah.
[01:01:57] Now, well, so we got just people that are just following orders, just ultra obedient,
[01:02:00] because that's what the the masculine thing is we just want to we want to obey and be part of the team.
[01:02:05] Okay, cool. Yeah. Not good. Okay.
[01:02:13] Chapter 20, leaders of men, how can the ability to lead depend on the ability to follow? You might
[01:02:18] as well say that the ability to float depends on the ability to sink. That's an interesting quote,
[01:02:23] which I don't agree with. The ability to lead, you don't necessarily, no, sorry,
[01:02:31] in order to follow, you don't necessarily, doesn't mean necessarily you're going to be a good
[01:02:38] leader, but if you're going to be a good leader, you better know how to follow as well. So that
[01:02:44] quote right there, which is from the Peter Principal, don't agree with it. Whatever it's other causes
[01:02:50] military incompetence implies a failure in leadership. This is hardly surprising of psychological
[01:02:54] problems, which beset military officers, few exceed and severity those associated with leadership.
[01:03:01] In this respect, they're required to fulfill incompatible roles. They're expected to show initiative,
[01:03:06] yet remain hemmed in by regulations. They must be aggressive, yet never in support of it. They must
[01:03:11] be a serious and caring for their men, yet maintaining enormous social distance. They must
[01:03:17] know everything about everything yet never appear intellectual. Finally, as we saw in the last
[01:03:21] chapter, they may well have been selected for attributes almost totally unrelated to the task they
[01:03:26] expected to perform. So that's an entire list of dichotomies of leadership.
[01:03:34] Discussing this of leadership is so often overloaded with vague, but a motive idea is that one is
[01:03:39] hard to put the nail to nail the concept down. So now he's trying to come up with a, with a
[01:03:44] definition for leadership. To cut through the monopoly of such quasi moral and unacceptable
[01:03:54] associations as patriotism. Play up and play the game. Never asking your men do something you
[01:04:00] wouldn't do for yourself. Not giving up. The square jaw, frank eyes of steadfast gaze. These are all
[01:04:06] like these sort of leadership things. If you'll, if you'll be a man, recipe, so he's given all these kind
[01:04:11] of traditional quotes about leadership and then he gives his, the simple truth that leadership
[01:04:18] is no more than exercising such an influence upon others that they tend to act and concert
[01:04:23] towards achieving a goal which they might not have achieved so readily had they been left to their
[01:04:28] own devices. Fair enough. Does that an epic definition of leadership? Not really.
[01:04:34] But it's a decent one. The ingredients which bring about this favorable state of affairs are
[01:04:43] many and varied. The most superficial level at the most superficial level, they are believed to include
[01:04:50] such factors as voice, stature and appearance, impression of omniscience, trustworthiness,
[01:04:57] sincerity and bravery. Add a deeper and rather more important level, leadership depends on a proper
[01:05:03] understanding of the needs and opinions of those one hopes to lead and the context in which
[01:05:11] leadership occurs. So that's a great definition. Well not so much a definition but it's a great point.
[01:05:16] Hey, your voice, your stature, your trustworthiness, your sincerity, your bravery. Those things
[01:05:21] are all important. But guess what's even more important? Understanding the needs and opinions of
[01:05:26] the people you're leading. That's what he's saying right there. So he nails that part straight up
[01:05:32] in short, there's nothing mysterious romantic or necessarily lovable about leadership in military
[01:05:37] organizations. Leaders are appointed rather than emergent. That is to say the needs of the
[01:05:44] individual soldier play almost no role in deciding the sort of leader he gets. Secondly, the military
[01:05:50] leader possesses constitutional power of a magnitude which surpasses that of leaders in most
[01:05:56] other human groups. If he cannot pull his followers by force of character, he can at least push
[01:06:02] them by force a law. I don't really bind to that too much. That's like, you know, because in
[01:06:08] the civilian world, oh, you don't want to do it. I'm telling you, call him in a fire you.
[01:06:11] Which you can do just like in the military, you can say shut up and do what I told you to do
[01:06:15] because I, you know, I have the backing of the constitution behind me, neither one of those are
[01:06:21] good leadership and they won't pan out for very long. The third and related feature of military
[01:06:27] leadership is that it essentially is essentially autocratic and operates in what modern theorists
[01:06:33] call a wheel net rather than an all channel communication net. In other words, the flow of essential
[01:06:41] information is too and fro between the leader and his subordinates rather than between all members of
[01:06:48] the group, not very surprisingly the wheel net, though no doubt gratifying to autocratic leaders
[01:06:55] produces more errors, slower solutions to problems and reduce gratification to the group, then
[01:07:00] does the more democratic all channel net. That's interesting. You want to participate with your whole
[01:07:06] group. I think that's how I operate. It doesn't really matter who comes with an ideal. We're good
[01:07:12] with it. Let's share it. In light of these considerations, it just perhaps trains that leadership
[01:07:18] in the British armed forces should have been as effective as it has. So he's like saying it's amazing
[01:07:23] that the British military was so effective because they freaking operate on these principles that suck.
[01:07:30] Since a salient feature of and by the way, you want to know why the soldiers, the soldiers get the
[01:07:36] job done. Since a salient feature of all the campaign so far considered has been a remarkable
[01:07:42] absence of the mutinist tendencies and a quite astonishing degree of tolerance for a dude
[01:07:48] and bravery shown by the common soldier. We have to ask was this despite or because of the leaders
[01:07:53] I'm going to go ahead and say despite in many cases. I saw this with many, many platoons over the
[01:08:01] years. You could have bad leadership, but if you have a few pipe hitters in there, then they will
[01:08:08] make things happen and that platoon will be successful even with bad leadership. Despite the leadership,
[01:08:17] they'll be successful. The first point of note is the distinction that has to be drawn between
[01:08:22] two roles of a leader, task specialist and social specialist. A task specialist is a leader's
[01:08:30] prime concern as a task specialist. A leader's prime concern is to achieve the group's goal
[01:08:36] in the case of the military defeating the enemy. For such a role being likable is rather less
[01:08:43] important trait than that of being more active, more intelligent and better informed than his followers.
[01:08:48] In his capacity as a social specialist, however, a leader's main function is to preserve good
[01:08:54] personal relations with the group. And within the group, thereby maintaining morale as to keep the
[01:09:00] group in being. In the military, may lose the function of a successful social specialist who would
[01:09:08] prevent mutiny and reduce such symptoms as low morale, absenteeism, desertion, sickness, and crime.
[01:09:16] Not very surprisingly, the most important attribute of such a leader is that he should be liked.
[01:09:22] A efficiency and task ability are of rather secondary importance. So this is something,
[01:09:29] I think, I wrote leadership strategy and tactics. But what is it leader trying to do? Build relationships
[01:09:34] in that team. Not just between yourself but between the whole team. That's what we're trying to do.
[01:09:38] That's what we're here for. And that task thing kind of works itself out. If you're doing a good
[01:09:45] job, build those relationships, that task thing is going to kind of handle itself.
[01:09:50] I'm just having such a hard time. He's using so many words. And what I'm actually trying to do is
[01:09:56] get my head wrapped around like 1970s England. So I'm trying to do. Because it's like, hey, how
[01:10:02] about I take those 12 pages and just write balance? You know what I mean? And yeah, even inside that,
[01:10:09] just like you, and I think the order in which you said it is the right thing is if he called it
[01:10:13] like democratic, we all feel part of it. Is everybody thinks I care about you? If my people think I care
[01:10:18] about them, they're going to get on board with a plan. And if I'm an autocrat and I tell people what to do
[01:10:23] and they have to do what they say no matter what, they're going to struggle with the plan. And if you
[01:10:28] go with that second, that first one, they'll do even harder things that are more challenging,
[01:10:34] more life threatening and less likely to be successful on paper or at least to their own risk,
[01:10:39] then if they don't think that I care about them, they'll be less likely to do hard things like
[01:10:44] combat. And then inside that, the little subtle point, and I'm glad you said it because I had
[01:10:49] exact same thought as even when that leadership doesn't reveal itself, which it clearly has not,
[01:10:54] there's another layer of leadership inside there. You know, you could call it your NCOs,
[01:10:58] whatever the term that you want to use those those pipe hitters inside your organization,
[01:11:02] they're still going to make it happen. Yeah, and just to make sure everyone understands
[01:11:06] when you want your team to think you care about them, how do you make that happen?
[01:11:10] You can have to care about them. And I shouldn't say, I should use a different word
[01:11:15] when they believe that. Not when they think that, but I'm trying to convince them of that.
[01:11:20] Yeah. When they come to believe that and go, oh, yeah, this guy cares. He really does. That's
[01:11:26] that is a that's a better way to describe and that's really what you're saying. Not that I,
[01:11:30] I manipulate them to thinking that, it's when they recognize it for themselves and they, and they see that.
[01:11:35] Yeah. They believe that.
[01:11:38] Says here, it has been shown that whereas low-stressed groups, operating situations that are
[01:11:43] devoid of painful uncertainties do best under democratic leadership, organizations like the military,
[01:11:50] in times of war that are subject to stressing ambiguities, actually prefer autocratic leadership.
[01:11:57] In other words, the feelings of dependency induced by stress, successful, successfully neutralized
[01:12:03] a person's normal, a versity toward the autocratic leader.
[01:12:09] While a man like towns and would not be likely to survive for very long in a modern civilian firm,
[01:12:16] his autocratic mean was lovingly accepted by men whose lives were hanging by a thread.
[01:12:24] So the reason that he points all this out is that these guys, some of these guys like towns,
[01:12:30] they still listen to him. They obeyed him.
[01:12:32] And what's interesting about this is he's making a huge generalization of organizations like
[01:12:42] the military in times of war, subject to stressing ambiguities prefer autocratic leadership.
[01:12:47] Let me tell you where the subtlety here is. 97% 98% 99% of the time even in a war.
[01:12:57] We want democratic leadership and there is a moment in time where there's confusion,
[01:13:04] where there's chaos, where there's mayhem, where everyone is looking at the leader to make a call.
[01:13:09] That happens in the military. It happens in business too. I mean, when Ashillon front hit COVID,
[01:13:17] he, we hear a bunch of ideas and then I became a little bit autocratic. He, here's what we're doing. Boom.
[01:13:21] And everyone was stoked. Don't, how, yeah, that's what we're doing.
[01:13:26] They were. And the thread that's inside both of those. And I think why autocratic behavior
[01:13:31] when you're the recipient of that, why you're willing to be treated like that or directed,
[01:13:36] if I have already made the connection on my mind that the thing that you're making me do,
[01:13:39] that you're directing me to do, is designed to help me keep me alive when my, when that that thread
[01:13:46] hangs in the, or the life hangs in the balance, whatever the word he just used there. If I make that
[01:13:50] connection and go, he's telling me to do this and what I know what he, I know why he's telling
[01:13:54] me this, did I'll follow what he was all doing. That's even bothering me. It doesn't bother me
[01:13:58] told what to do to be mandated anything for my boss if I go, oh, I see what's happening here. I'm
[01:14:04] going to go execute. Now, if you spin your whole career, being an autocratic, just tell me what to do,
[01:14:09] dude, I got news for you. Even when you actually need in those rare two, three percent
[01:14:14] occasions, you need to do that. You're in a very, very hard time getting your people to follow you.
[01:14:19] Yeah, this is a point that I made deeply in leadership strategy in tactics when I talk about
[01:14:25] leadership in the leadership vacuum. And I mean, I went into some specifics in there, like letting
[01:14:31] that vacuum exist for just a second longer just to make sure everyone feels it. I would make sure
[01:14:37] I'd wait an extra half a second or one second before I said anything to make sure everyone knew
[01:14:43] oh, damn, we don't know what we're doing right now and they are waiting to be led. They are waiting
[01:14:48] for that that autocratic leader to step in, say everyone lock it up or move into that building and
[01:14:53] they are so on board for that. If you make that call a little too early, you get resistant some
[01:14:57] people, I would, how do you know what? You got to let it, you got to let it just let it be there
[01:15:03] for a moment, let everyone see, oh, it's a vacuum. I don't know what to do and then boom. And if you wait
[01:15:09] too long, well, then some other people are churping in with their ideas, you can get some confusion.
[01:15:14] So you got to time that very well. But it's unfortunate that he says he kind of blank, it's the
[01:15:19] whole thing because it's not true. It's not a blank at statement. Even in war, people want to have
[01:15:25] more say as what's happening. He's also doing one thing that I don't agree with either,
[01:15:29] he's jogging some contrast between this military leader and that military leader is inability
[01:15:33] to be successful in the private sector because the military response at these type of behaviors
[01:15:37] in the private sector doesn't. Well, when he's talking about that, he's talking about the fact that
[01:15:47] if you have a authoritarian leader in the civilian, it's going to be less successful. Here's a
[01:15:54] point that I made the other day, which you actually know, I agree with you, you're right, that doesn't
[01:15:58] make sense. Here's why, and he doesn't point to sound in the spoke, I pointed to sound the other day.
[01:16:02] In the military, bad leaders can get promoted. Easier than bad leaders can get promoted in the
[01:16:10] civilian sector. Why is that? Because in the military, you're going to be in charge. How long
[01:16:14] were you in charge of your squadron for? Two years. And that's what that's what a military leader
[01:16:20] gets. Yep. So you get two years. And by the time that enlisted guys figure out, this guy's a
[01:16:26] jackass, it takes him sick months to confirm that. And then it's like, okay, well, now we're
[01:16:30] starting to work up. We're going to actually do nothing. Well, hey, he'll be gone. Forget about it.
[01:16:33] And that guy Dave Burke, it's promoted. Because he did his job. He did it correctly. No one said anything
[01:16:39] boom. Whereas civilian world, like you're in charge of that whatever division for years. And
[01:16:45] everybody knows it. That's another thing. Military, oh, you did one, you know, one command deployment
[01:16:50] here in Virginia, then you're going to San Diego, then you're going to Bahrain, then you're
[01:16:56] just traveling around. And you can get away with it. So that's one of the reasons I think why the,
[01:17:03] why the military can produce some bad leaders. Yes. And they can get promoted. Yeah. As long as
[01:17:10] that comment you made is understood that this success in the private sector, comparison with the
[01:17:15] success in the military sector, your point is the bad leaders might stick around. They're not
[01:17:20] good leaders by virtue of the military environment. They're bad leaders that are being
[01:17:24] that are sticking around because the military has a mechanism that's sort of a loudst for it.
[01:17:28] But just I just, I don't like the thought that there's a distinction that military leader,
[01:17:34] good military leadership is different from other types of leadership. That's 100% accurate. Yeah.
[01:17:40] Fast forward a little bit. But even given the right circumstances, an autocratic mean is no
[01:17:47] bar to being liked. We still need some more positive reasons for the extraordinary popularity of
[01:17:55] otherwise incompetent commanders. So he talks about the fact that like, why do you still like?
[01:18:03] Why did these guys like towns and who got a bunch of his men killed? Why did they still like him?
[01:18:08] Why did they still follow him? One of the reasons he talks about his success for leadership
[01:18:14] tended to occur if followers had been indulged by their leaders? That makes sense, right? Oh,
[01:18:21] if you'd actually taken care of your guys, they would be more likely to follow you. Well, that makes sense.
[01:18:26] That actually makes sense. That's a good reason. A situation in which the motivational
[01:18:34] as opposed to the intellectual aspects of leadership may lead to military disasters where obedience
[01:18:40] evoked by hero worship, blunt reason, and moral sensitivity to such an extent that the group
[01:18:46] may embark on a behavior which is a little short of suicidal. Again, he's trying to figure out
[01:18:51] why in some situations do people that are idiots still get followed?
[01:18:57] There is however one further aspect of these more nebulous qualities of leadership, which is
[01:19:02] played a not-inconsidible part in the story of military incompetence. It concerns the position
[01:19:08] which an individual occupies on two related continuas. Those of boldness to caution and
[01:19:15] impulsiveness to indecision. Over the years of military incompetence has resulted
[01:19:21] more from a dearth of boldness than from a lack of caution and more from a
[01:19:26] Paul of indecision than an excess of impulsivity. So he's saying that most of the problems that occur
[01:19:33] don't occur because action is taken to impulsive action. They actually call it happened for the other
[01:19:40] reason. Don't want to do anything. That's why the term default aggressive exists.
[01:19:45] Because if you don't do anything, chances are it's going to be bad. Your default mode should
[01:19:51] be to make something happen. Real quick, nothing interrupt. It's so autocratic. What exactly is that?
[01:19:57] It's close to a authoritarian, but it's weird. He uses the term autocratic. It's like, hey,
[01:20:03] I'm in charge. I'm in control. It's one person in control. Charge in in control.
[01:20:07] But he differentiates between autocratic meaning like listen. Hey, I'm the guy in charge. I'm going
[01:20:14] to tell us where to go and the authoritarian, which is very strong handed form of autocratic rule.
[01:20:23] He doesn't necessarily, he gives an autocratic a little bit of negativity, but he's also like,
[01:20:30] hey, you're an opportune. That's a pertune commander. It's autocratic. What he says, we're going to do.
[01:20:36] That is the reality of the situation. The better reality is a democratic.
[01:20:42] 97% of the time, 3% of the time, autocratic. 3% of the time, hey, I'm in charge of this
[01:20:47] world. We're going to make happen right now. We've got to make this happen now. Boom.
[01:20:50] Yeah, it's like, I don't kind of think, I remember, okay, you know, all you have entrepreneurs,
[01:20:56] and then you have like employee types, right? Yes. And then you like certain personalities go along
[01:21:01] with each one of them. Way better, right? Because some people, it's face like they just tell me where to
[01:21:07] be. What time? And tell me what to do, men all and they'll go hard. No go and they'll do it.
[01:21:11] They'll get it. Get the job done super good, you know, within their little, within their job
[01:21:16] descriptions. Go. You know? And then some people they go crazy with that kind of stuff. And then
[01:21:20] they just rather like think and go out and call their outside the lines and all this stuff, you know?
[01:21:24] So it's like, it's a lot of critic is kind of maybe for people who are, yeah, like that, right?
[01:21:29] But here's the thing. There's everyone has a spectrum, right? And there's going to be times
[01:21:36] where if you're working for me, echo, there's going to be times to the two wives, it's got
[01:21:39] boss in me around. And there'll be other times you'd be waiting for me to tell you what to, even you,
[01:21:44] as a one human can have, you can, you can transit across that spectrum. And what I'm saying is
[01:21:51] when there's a lot of pressure on and there's mayhem going on, most people are going to want
[01:21:56] somebody to tell them to what to do. I shouldn't say most, many, many people are going to say,
[01:22:01] dude, you need to tell me what to do right now because there's bad stuff going on.
[01:22:05] I'm going to that scene in saving private right right at the beginning, right? That crazy part.
[01:22:09] Yep. And then he kind of loses his hearing or something like that. This old, he just kind of,
[01:22:14] like, snaps to and disguising front of the safe and what do we do now? That's a classic.
[01:22:19] Yeah, that's kind of like that. That's a classic example of, hey, those guys are looking to be
[01:22:24] led at that moment. And it took a lot to get them to that point, but there they are.
[01:22:30] So that's a good one. One of the obvious explanations for the failure of motivational
[01:22:37] aspects of leadership is in all these instances related to the advanced age of the individuals
[01:22:43] concerned, old men are more cautious than young men and less able to make quick decisions than
[01:22:49] those whose arteries have not begun to harden. I've cut out a lot of the joke. This guy's a fun
[01:22:54] guy. I will say there are other more fundamental and pervasive reasons for these failures and
[01:23:00] leadership, which can be ascribed to the general psychopathology of military organizations. They are
[01:23:04] common denominator is anxiety. It is a feature of armed services that the penalty for error is very
[01:23:11] much more substantial than their reward for success. That is so important to remember for your
[01:23:19] organization. The penalty for error is way harder than their reward you get when you do something good.
[01:23:25] That's absolutely true in the military. So what kind of people do you end up with?
[01:23:30] Right? Whereas the Naval Officer who threw an error of judgment on the part of his
[01:23:34] subordinates puts a ship of ground will almost certainly be court-martialed and stands at
[01:23:38] fair chance of being heavily punished. They're a reward for taking a bold action which pays off
[01:23:43] maybe no more than a mention in the dispatch or some decoration with little or no effect upon
[01:23:47] promotional aspects. The net result of this bias towards negative reinforcement will be that
[01:23:54] fear of failure rather than hope of success tends to be the dominant motive force in decision-making
[01:24:00] and the higher rank the stronger this motive. There is farther to fall. This is a good thing to
[01:24:06] remember with your kids. Right? With your kids. You know, your kids operating out of fear of making
[01:24:12] a mistake. You want your kids operating all in the hope of being successful. Finally,
[01:24:19] mention must be made of a thesis put forward by Simon Raven which may bowed ill for the future.
[01:24:25] It concerns the role of false premises in the training of officers, false premises that
[01:24:29] have their origin in a simple and obvious fact that an expectation of superiority in a leader
[01:24:35] by those who led will increase the tendency to follow him. This was kind of strange.
[01:24:41] For years, it was the case that since they were drawn from a socio-economic class that was vastly
[01:24:46] inferior to that of the officers, the rank and file took for granted that their officers knew
[01:24:50] more than they did and weren't a very real sense born to lead. I.e. were born into that class
[01:24:55] which traditionally the core of officers was drawn. That's the way it used to be. You kind of were
[01:25:00] whatever, a peasant and you had this Lord that was your officer and you're like, hey,
[01:25:05] do this dude supposed to be in charge. So I'm kind of going to listen to him. Since the last
[01:25:10] word that this has changed, officers are no longer recruited exclusively from the upper classes.
[01:25:14] Comparatively, few are landed from gentry or aristocratic families. A many have not even attended
[01:25:18] a public school, which a public school in England is a private school. By the same token,
[01:25:24] the rank and file are better educated and more sophisticated than their forebears. So the troops
[01:25:29] are more educated. At first, blushes would seem all to the good, giving promise of a democratization
[01:25:37] in the profession of arms, a trend which would one day place on par with most other vocations
[01:25:42] in civilized society. Unfortunately, according to Raven Smith, Simon Ravens thesis,
[01:25:48] something quite other is happening confronted with the necessity of recruiting its officers
[01:25:52] from a section of society that would have been unthinkable and years gone by. The military has made
[01:25:56] it made what it regards as the best of a bad job by insisting that since officers must still
[01:26:02] be gentlemen where no natural gulf exists between those who lead and those who follow this must
[01:26:08] be artificially inculcated by training. So this is a little bit hard to follow, but I'm going
[01:26:14] to just give a little detail here. So you used to have these people that were lords or whatever.
[01:26:20] And so the troops were freaking peasants and they're like, cool, this guy's a lord. I should
[01:26:25] probably be less than two of them. He's a gentleman. He purports himself as a leader.
[01:26:29] Cool. I'm going to tend to follow. Then all of a sudden they started recruiting officers from wherever.
[01:26:35] And now they had to say, wait a second, they still need to be gentlemen. So we're going to
[01:26:41] inculcate this difference into them. We're going to make them into a higher class.
[01:26:48] What does inculcate? Like, sort of put that seed into them. We're going to
[01:26:55] turn them into that. We're going to plant this in them. As far as just an idea or like really,
[01:27:01] like, okay, we're going to inculcate these people. We're going to train them to beat that or we
[01:27:05] just going to plant that seed and everyone's head. So it seems like that. Yeah. So what he says is
[01:27:09] are officially inculcated. So he's like, we're going to fake this. We're going to try and make these
[01:27:13] people seem as if they're of a higher class, which is like that right there, we should already be
[01:27:20] thinking, uh oh, right. Uh oh. The following excerpts from Raven's article should make the
[01:27:27] matter plain. We start with a glimpse of life at the Royal Military Academy and later at the school
[01:27:32] of infantry at warminster in the 1950s, according to Raven, the products of this training regimen
[01:27:39] may be as bizarre as those depicted in the four character studies, which conclude this section.
[01:27:44] Here we go. Silluting at Sanhurst is tremendous. If you walk round Sanhurst,
[01:27:49] looking remotely as if you might be an officer, you will receive an incestant barrage of
[01:27:53] compliments. The muddy boy in PT shorts will stop running square shoulders and snap his eyes
[01:27:58] in your direction like knives. The elegant young gentleman in the brown trillbee will lift it from
[01:28:04] his head with a controlled jerk to replace it in the exact number of seconds later at a precise
[01:28:08] in the same angle, boys in uniform with sticks, swords, rifles or submachine guns will perform
[01:28:12] a volume of intricate movements alone or as a body, especially for your benefit.
[01:28:16] So we're trying to make people think they're elevated to the detached observer, these quaint
[01:28:25] antics may seem ludicrous, boring, or even faintly embarrassing. However, there will be others so
[01:28:33] emotionally incapable of distinguishing between compliments paid to the abstractions of rank
[01:28:39] and commission and those paid to themselves as people that they will actually enjoy these
[01:28:46] gesticulations. This is where the trouble starts. This is when you are going to, you know,
[01:28:53] you're going to OCS or wherever you're getting trained and you start thinking you're damn right,
[01:28:57] you're saluting me. You are saluting me. But such enjoyment of these mandatory conventions based
[01:29:06] upon a highly motivated, if understandable misinterpretation of their meaning may like the effects
[01:29:12] of even the most transparent flattery provoked holy unrealistic feelings of self-importance.
[01:29:20] And you know what's kind of weird? It is kind of weird. In the military,
[01:29:25] one of the big distinctions is you get called, officers get called sir.
[01:29:30] Right? So think about that. You're an officer, you get called sir. It doesn't matter if you're 21
[01:29:34] years old and you just graduated from OCS or you just graduated from the academy. You're getting
[01:29:39] called sir. So there's some people that go, man, you know what? We're really awkward to be called
[01:29:44] sir when I'm actually 22 years old and this guy's 38 years old. That's kind of weird. But I get
[01:29:49] it. It's the military convention. That's a great attitude to have. And you know what? There is
[01:29:54] a level of respect, even when a seasoned non-commissioned officer, a platoon chief calls a young officer,
[01:30:01] sir, he doesn't respect the way and there's a known, it doesn't need to be said.
[01:30:06] Hey, I'm giving you your props. It's good. That's the way the rank structure works and it is like this
[01:30:12] just beautiful relationship. Yeah, but then there's some people that go, yeah, you're damn right?
[01:30:19] You call me sir. Yeah, it's like the like, okay, like the seasoned guy is calling the new guys
[01:30:25] sir or whatever. It's the officer. That's almost like it's respect for the whole
[01:30:29] instant drag. Yes, 100%. Yeah. It's respect for the whole thing and a good young officer goes, man.
[01:30:38] Little bit uncomfortable with what that's the kind of the deal here. I get it and that and so there's also
[01:30:43] there's also endless to guys that go through that phase like who the hell am I calling this guy?
[01:30:47] Sir, that's freaking ridiculous. I'll call you Lieutenant. I'm not calling you sir.
[01:30:52] Sir is for my grandfather. So again, they go through that phase.
[01:30:55] Yeah, young and listed guys will go through that phase of like, I'm not calling this guy. Sir.
[01:31:06] Other significant features of the sand, herst, may-loo according to Ravenr,
[01:31:11] the perfect system where in cadets of higher rank are required to discipline or report upon those of lower
[01:31:16] status. The mind blunting drill square upon which three apparent essentials for a career of violence,
[01:31:23] unthinking obedience and exquisite capacity for keeping in-step and a proper concern for the
[01:31:28] minutia of dress are instilled for our upon our until fatigue and sweat hang over the mast cadets like
[01:31:35] brinstone over sawdom. And finally, the total loss of privacy and lack of leisure for the following
[01:31:41] of idiosyncratic interest and pastimes taken together the features of the royal military academy
[01:31:47] are designed to quote, build character and imbue future officers with values proper to their calling,
[01:31:54] any gaps which sandhurst might leave in a total program for the incocation of an officer like
[01:31:59] quality, our admirably filled up says Ravenr by the quasi morale imperatives of warm minister.
[01:32:06] These cluster around the concepts of guts and enthusiasm, humor,
[01:32:10] sociability and responsibility traits which every officer should show. So they got done with sandhurst
[01:32:16] which is like their military college now. They're their advanced school, this place warm minister,
[01:32:21] and whatever they didn't get it, whatever gaps there are, they're going to go even harder
[01:32:27] at warm minister. While much of the training was inevitably designed to promote physical fitness
[01:32:32] that was nevertheless a strong held belief that an officer, whether fit or not, should always
[01:32:36] have so much in the way of pride or guts that he would never admit to physical inadequacy until
[01:32:41] he dropped dead or unconscious. This belief of very significant one was both mythical, was myth mystical,
[01:32:47] both in nature and intensity. Now we're kind of talking about that, that's kind of a badass thing though.
[01:32:52] Right? It's kind of a badass thing. Hey, you're not going to give up. You're not going to stand
[01:32:58] down. Doesn't matter who you read. You're not. You put on that rock sack. You're going to finish
[01:33:01] this damn march. That's what's happening. This was interesting. Another warm minister virtue
[01:33:08] was a peculiar brand of humor. This was not the ability to see oneself and see one's activities
[01:33:13] into detached and ironical spirit. That would have been fatal. Humor meant being cheerful in the
[01:33:18] face of unpleasant circumstances, rallying the men's spirits by laughing with them over some slapstick
[01:33:24] incident, submitting like a good sport to an unjust punishment given to oneself by the
[01:33:29] agedent and laughing about it afterwards in the mess. This conception of humor and obvious
[01:33:34] branch of guts was in fact a streetly designed to counteract or totally extinguish any tendency
[01:33:40] towards an objective or intellectual humor that might contain tingees of satire or cynicism
[01:33:45] for such a thing would have been detrimental to another highly prized virtue that of enthusiasm.
[01:33:51] So this little brand of humor comes out where there's nothing directed with negativity
[01:33:58] up the chain of command. It's all just funny. I think that's actually, again, maybe I'm this
[01:34:06] the brainwashed dude here, but I think that the guts part is cool. I think that the dark humor
[01:34:10] twisted humor thing is kind of cool too because there's nothing better than getting
[01:34:14] getting in shitty situations than being able to laugh about it. I think that's cool.
[01:34:21] I guess maybe if you take it both these things to this far extreme where we're not protesting
[01:34:28] anything because we're just gonna laugh at it or we're not gonna ever stop because we're just
[01:34:31] gonna keep going even if it's gonna be harmful to us or our troops. Then it turns bad I guess.
[01:34:38] And he's got this word enthusiasm. enthusiasm I can hardly trust myself to speak. It
[01:34:43] seemed to mean a sort of blind uncritical application to any task. However, silly or futile
[01:34:49] that the neurosis or panic of superior might have suddenly thrust upon us. Since one of the
[01:34:54] points of enthusiasm that you started doing whatever it was straight away and without wasting time
[01:34:58] on question enthusiasm could involve a friend and expense of time and energy on some trifling
[01:35:02] project, wastefully because uncritically undertaken abandoned halfway as a rationally was as
[01:35:10] as it was commenced. This of course was just what great soldiers of the past wish to avoid when they
[01:35:16] deplored the indiscriminate use of zeal. Why zeal condemned a like by classmates and Wellington should
[01:35:24] now once again be thought desirable. It is interesting to speculate. So this idea of enthusiasm
[01:35:29] also known as zeal is like hey I'm just on board for whatever you tell me to do. And I guess
[01:35:36] that's another thing. Is it a beautiful thing? In many cases yes it is but if you're getting told
[01:35:41] the charge of machine gunnast and you go Roger that with enthusiasm and zeal and you get all your
[01:35:45] guys killed that's not what we want. That shouldn't be what we want. Maybe the world of what
[01:35:50] one that's what we quote wanted but we shouldn't want that. You should want push back.
[01:35:57] Loyalty meant there's another term loyalty loyalty meant that you were required in the name of the
[01:36:01] queen and honor of the regiment to conceal any impatience or amusement you might feel when the
[01:36:06] demands of your enthusiasm became operatic, first seek, first of all or just plain impossible
[01:36:12] of fulfillment. Loyalty in fact was the conception often blatantly used to blackmail you into silence
[01:36:18] when you were faced with incompetence and justice or sheer fallie of his beard officer. That was kind
[01:36:22] of funny. This is just loyalty. Dude, what's your loyalty? Bro he wants me to listen does make
[01:36:27] me sense bro you need to be more loyal. Right? So she ability was also highly esteemed at warm
[01:36:35] insta. This like loyalty could mean many good things such as hospitality and the desire to please in social
[01:36:42] intercourse but it also implied an unquestioning difference to the convenience and opinions of once
[01:36:47] military superiors. So you're just going to get on board with whatever an else is saying
[01:36:52] and you can see what we're doing. We're creating robots. We're not creating thinking people and this is bad.
[01:36:57] Courage under fire a sort of distilled essence of guts could not exactly be taught so it had to
[01:37:02] be taken for granted and all of us who were tacitly and grimly assumed to possess it. Hence we can
[01:37:07] pass to a very much boosted commodity initiative. So we now we finally go okay cool we want to see
[01:37:13] initiative. Unfortunately in the peacetime conditions even for the most part in wartime ones
[01:37:19] communications are now so good that an opportunity for genuinely individual action so rare that
[01:37:24] initiative tends to become a highly contrived thing artificially fostered to impress superiors. The
[01:37:32] sort of person who is praised at warm insta for initiative generally turned out to be a metal
[01:37:35] symboly of the type who reports to his best friend or to his house master for immoral behavior
[01:37:41] thereby himself becoming head prefect in his friend's place. There you go. So this section he
[01:37:50] gives a bunch of examples of various types of these officers and how they turned out. It seems
[01:37:57] fast forward a little bit. It seems that all remained of his training in the mind of each recipient
[01:38:02] was the faulty syllogism officer should be gentleman. I am an officer therefore I am a gentleman.
[01:38:10] After this he seemed to behave neither as an officer nor as a gentleman in generally any accepted
[01:38:17] sense of these terms. And Raven says this once an officer is established in his own view as a member
[01:38:23] of a superior and order giving classes. Class he never loses this sense. This is where things turn
[01:38:31] into a nightmare. Right so an officer is established in his own view. As a member of a superior and order
[01:38:38] giving class he never loses this sense but he can and often does lose all awareness of the moral
[01:38:46] basis of this superiority and all the qualities which constitute this basis. So he forgets why he's
[01:38:53] in this position. He forgets that he was just like placed here. He starts to believe his own bullshit
[01:38:58] and the bullshit that's been fed to him that people run around calling him so I'm saluting him.
[01:39:03] He just becomes superior as it were in Vaccoa which means in in a vacuum he's in a vacuum he's
[01:39:11] just superior. He becomes a gentleman when this happens one gets that product so typical of the British
[01:39:19] the amateur English officer highly trained professional and professionally and morally he is
[01:39:24] forgotten his professional his professional techniques and sloth off in his sense of moral obligation
[01:39:31] but he retained an unassailable sense of his own superiority and absolute right to give orders.
[01:39:40] And my note next to that was nightmare. That's a nightmare to forget how you ended up in this position
[01:39:49] to forget that you don't know everything to just get told that you're an officer and you're
[01:39:55] superior and you start to believe that this is a nightmare of leadership.
[01:39:59] Now it's things are different the social distance between officers and men more often than
[01:40:11] not contrived rather than rooted in their ancestry. For officers of humble origins this might
[01:40:16] well be expected to produce sizable problems of adjustment. The first jolt to their social reinforcement
[01:40:22] standard will be of one of descriptive discrepancies. What's interesting about this is there's no guarantee
[01:40:29] like I knew officers that came silver spoon all day long and they were just down to earth good people
[01:40:37] and I also knew silver spoon officers that thought that they deserved they thought that they were
[01:40:43] superior. I also knew some guys from lower class that scrambled through and scraped through and
[01:40:48] became officers and they were awesome and they never forgot where they came from and I also knew
[01:40:54] officers that had come up through the ranks and they were turds.
[01:41:00] Lave points out that the best officer that went through his junior officer training
[01:41:07] was a prior-and-listen officer and the worst officer that went through his junior officer training was a
[01:41:13] prior-listen officer which is crazy to think. That's crazy to think. I think that I agree with that.
[01:41:19] Your description those four categories whatever you want to call them. Same thing. Same the exact same thing.
[01:41:26] And I'm trying to remember the way you were describing it is I remember I guess I don't remember
[01:41:30] like the first time it happened but there's like a ceremony. Do you have a first salute ceremony?
[01:41:36] Yep. And I remember that being an incredibly uncomfortable experience for me. Like man this is weird.
[01:41:44] The guy who I did it was a good friend of mine who's a listed marine he had fought in desert storm.
[01:41:48] He was a known well-known guy and just by virtue of accomplishing the criteria to make me an
[01:41:56] officer like from one moment to the next he saluted me. And I think I was just lucky to have that sense
[01:42:03] like man this is weird. You know but also I think you described it well like the reverence for
[01:42:09] the institution like this is how the institution is designed and if you have that reverence for it
[01:42:13] he didn't feel the mean and I didn't feel superior and yet that's the way it's supposed to be.
[01:42:17] Yeah and yet how easily like oh I could get used to this. You know how quickly people fall to that trap
[01:42:25] of all into that trap and it's not the and it's not the institution that bestowed this on me.
[01:42:30] Yeah I was your is there yes. Yeah I mean and this again we're talking about the military
[01:42:37] specifically but you can apply this anywhere you can apply this anywhere oh well I you know I went to
[01:42:42] this college I went through this program I got my MBA from here or there and all of a sudden it's like oh
[01:42:50] did I tell you that? Did I mention where I went to college you know it's like
[01:42:54] hmm yeah that's cool man appreciate it that's awesome. Yeah but when you say nobody notices it.
[01:43:06] There's a there's a note about this Raven's assessment so somebody kind of read that big
[01:43:12] assessment of San Hirsten and this guy says I read Simon Ravens paper with great interest when
[01:43:18] you when you ask from my comments you must bear in mind that in 1898 when I was gazetted I joined a
[01:43:25] totally different type of army from that of today it was an aristocratic army feudal in the
[01:43:32] sense that it was grounded on leadership and fall and fellowship in which with few exceptions the
[01:43:37] leaders were the sons of gentlemen and more frequently than not the eldest sons the most privileged sons
[01:43:43] when I went to San Hirst we were not taught to behave like gentlemen because it never occurred to
[01:43:51] anyone that we should behave otherwise we were taught a lot of obsolete tactics in every army the
[01:43:56] of that day did a tremendous lot of useless drill but never heard a word about responsibility,
[01:44:01] loyalty, guts, et cetera because so I suppose these were held to be the natural prerequisites of
[01:44:07] gentlemen so this is back in the day when it's like hey man you better act like this you you're
[01:44:12] upholding the family named the men the followers of that period were a rough lot simple tough
[01:44:20] alliterate largely recruited from down melts men who had a lot met who met who had gotten a lot of
[01:44:26] trouble vagabonds and a sprinkling of the grand sons and grandsons sons of nCOs and private soldiers
[01:44:32] military families who generally became nCOs they were therefore two distinct classes really
[01:44:37] cast by birth on the whole the men looked up to their officers whether they were a fission or
[01:44:43] insufficient or inefficient and the officers did not look down on their men why should they so he was
[01:44:50] saying like this was just kind of the way it was back then the idea of an officer imposing on his
[01:44:57] imposing his will on his men never entered his head because one class was so superior and the other
[01:45:04] so inferior that it was unnecessary to do this there wasn't even any opposing ideas to what you were saying
[01:45:11] the superior could not lose cast should he play or mix with his men I remember this is a good story
[01:45:18] I remember on my first tour as an orderly officer on the QMS was late for the QMS mean the
[01:45:25] quartermaster so one of the sailors was late for meat issue and I thought he had risked it because
[01:45:31] I was a novice so I put him under arrest when this was reported to the agitant he took me aside and
[01:45:39] said strictly speaking you were right but actually speaking you weren't ass so don't do it again
[01:45:45] and I didn't so he like punished this guy trying to prove that he was pretty said hey bro what are you
[01:45:48] knowing you you technically you could do that but that's not the way you treat your people
[01:45:57] of the present day democratic army I know next to nothing
[01:45:59] like the older aristocratic one it must have its good points and is probably more efficient but
[01:46:05] to me it is a folly to try and mix the two a gentleman is born and not made it is probably true
[01:46:10] that it takes three generations to fashion one and so it would appear for Mr. Ravens experiences if you
[01:46:16] try and make them synthetically you get neither an aristocrat or a democracy one sees this everywhere
[01:46:23] today among the rich the poor on the roads and in the factories I repeat it again gentleman
[01:46:29] are not turned out like sausages they are turned they are men of ingrained honor of principle
[01:46:34] and of decent behavior and some of the finest I have met in my long life had the long to the
[01:46:41] humblest classes because this cast rather than class is becoming extinct in my home
[01:46:47] opinion one of the great factors at the bottom of the present world turmoil and that's from JFC
[01:46:55] follower and he's another guy that was sort of in league with l'Adel Hart lots of great ideas
[01:47:02] fought north Africa or far north war war or sorry in South Africa far world war one
[01:47:06] who the Nazis took a bunch of his ideas and ran with them by the way even though he's a Brit
[01:47:12] so it's just a different I I wonder we that park is it's just a different world this is the
[01:47:17] different situation and they court sort of had this pre-existing system that was in place now what
[01:47:25] kind of makes me disturbed about this is you know he's he's basically talking about how great
[01:47:31] the gentleman were of the day but these were the gentleman that freaking acted like idiots
[01:47:36] leading their troops to be killed so there wasn't so much honor and principle as he's talking
[01:47:42] about close now this section he says from a general study of leadership it seems
[01:47:49] there is much in military organizations to invite incompetence officers are selected for the wrong
[01:47:54] reasons required to fulfill in compatible roles and expected to function adequately in a communication
[01:48:01] system of dubious efficiency at higher levels of command they are protected from adverse criticism
[01:48:08] by their invisibility and by the plain fact that in times of stress even the poorest leaders like
[01:48:15] drunken fathers and rabbits feet are clung to with pathetic if misplaced dependency
[01:48:22] yeah the invisibility part he mentioned that and was talking about the fact that
[01:48:28] a lot of these senior leaders they just no one would see him you wouldn't see him on the front lines
[01:48:32] so they weren't getting criticism because they were they weren't around to be criticized
[01:48:35] mm-hmm military achievement besides providing legitimate outlets for aggression
[01:48:42] the gratification of obsessive tendencies and reassurances about virtual reality armies and
[01:48:49] navies also cater for another basic human motive the need to achieve they do this in several ways
[01:48:57] they embody related hierarchies of rank money and class so there's another thing that you can get
[01:49:01] by joining the military if you're a person that's driven to succeed you go in the military and you can get
[01:49:05] like a formatted way to move up the chain of command. Second they accentuate the challenge
[01:49:13] of promotional ladder by making certain upward movements very difficult indeed third the ethos of
[01:49:19] the armed forces is such that such as to make advancement lovable and highly rewarding generals
[01:49:25] have every advantage bar that of age over those lower down on the ladder they are richer,
[01:49:30] safer and more comfortable their chances of collecting honors orders and nighthooks are
[01:49:35] imminently greater than those of more junior ranks finally even the most modest thirst for
[01:49:41] achievement is encouraged by training and convention the taboo on junior speaking to senior seniors
[01:49:47] in officer training establishments saluting and being saluted orders of march rules as to say
[01:49:53] as who says sir to whom all serve to emphasize the horizontal stratifications of military
[01:49:59] organizations besides adding lustre to each new level gained so that's what the military sets up this
[01:50:08] really nice place where you can kind of you see what the game is and if you don't want to play
[01:50:11] the game you're going to get you're going to get satisfaction unfortunately there are aspects
[01:50:17] of military career which are unlikely to attract people with high achievement motivation
[01:50:22] and he says this at first sight these arguments would seem to suggest that the possibility
[01:50:26] of promotion in the military organization would attract those with a potential for achievement
[01:50:30] go getters entrepreneurs innovators and men with energy and drive in short people who would make
[01:50:35] first class military commanders right so you think oh cool this is like a hierarchy set up that
[01:50:39] make sense I'm down I want to go in there because I'm an entrepreneur I'm a go getter
[01:50:43] sometimes it does in the case of wellington Montgomery rommel and zukov men with in order
[01:50:48] to lead strong needs for achievement all those guys wanted to do well
[01:50:51] unfortunately however there are aspects of a military career which are unlikely to attract
[01:50:57] people with high achievement motivation the fact that traditionally promotion depends upon
[01:51:02] seniority class wealth conformity and obedience may well leave them rather cold neither means
[01:51:08] nor the ends are sufficiently attractive so when you get a guy like Wellington like rommel
[01:51:13] they look and say okay how do I need to get promoted oh I've got a conform I've got to be a
[01:51:18] yes man so all their entrepreneurial spirit is thrown out the window they don't they they're
[01:51:24] being forced to comply in order to get promoted so it doesn't really seem as attractive as they
[01:51:29] thought originally was going to be moral for military types military has never smiled upon
[01:51:36] entrepreneurs and innovators the cut and thrust of private enterprise cleverness and even working
[01:51:41] too hard have not been deemed good form there is however another class of person for whom the military
[01:51:49] might well be an attractive proposition these are people who achievement motivation is pathological
[01:51:55] in origin the crucial difference between the two sorts of achievement the healthy and the pathological
[01:52:02] may be summarized by saying that whereas the first is buoyed up by hopes of success the second
[01:52:09] is driven by fear of failure. One person that wants to do a good job and one's person that
[01:52:15] just scared to fail whereas the former achieves out of a quest of excellence in his job the latter
[01:52:21] achieves by any means available not necessarily because of any sincere devotion to the work
[01:52:27] but because of the status social promotion or social approval and reduction of doubts about the
[01:52:32] self that's such achievement brings applying these distinctions to the military would seem that
[01:52:37] senior commanders fall into two groups and I think this is actually pretty accurate those primarily
[01:52:44] concerned with improving their professional ability and those primarily concerned with self-betterment
[01:52:54] a fast forward a little bit research suggests that these two sorts of achievement motivation
[01:52:58] go along with certain other personality traits thus need achievement motivation towards
[01:53:04] professional excellence is accompanied by greater occupational and intellectual competence so this is
[01:53:09] a person that wants to get promoted for the right reasons greater occupational and intellectual
[01:53:13] competence that's what he wants a better memory for uncomplete a task and therefore a predisposition
[01:53:18] to finish something once the gun a preference when choosing working partners for successful strangers
[01:53:24] rather than unsuccessful friends that's one just the you crappy leaders always surround themselves with
[01:53:29] their crappy unsuccessful friends a great greater readiness to volunteer for psychological experiments
[01:53:35] greater activity in the institution or community of which they are a member so this is I think
[01:53:43] it's just important remember that there's some people that are out there for themselves
[01:53:48] and there's some people that are out there to try and do a good job he says compare
[01:53:51] Lawrence and this is Lawrence of Arabia compare Lawrence roughing it with his tiny Arab force
[01:53:56] on the 800 mile trek across the desert to west to to rest akaba from the Turks with towns and
[01:54:05] comfortably a sconce and his villa on the sea of mormara while his captured troops died in their
[01:54:11] thousands from exposure malnutrition and brutality the contrast in both cases in between the
[01:54:16] self imposed as sadism of high achievement motivation and the self indulgence of one concerned with
[01:54:23] professional excellence less concerned with professional excellence than with personal advantage
[01:54:30] pretty good stark difference between those two how is it that some of the criteria for
[01:54:36] promotion to military organizations are evidently such as to favor people with a pathological
[01:54:42] degree of achievement motivation this is scary the person that might have a tendency to get promoted
[01:54:47] is the one that's looking out for themselves in some cases in the military again isn't
[01:54:52] important to say this isn't like the entire military but certainly I certainly saw people in the military
[01:54:58] that were 100% looking out for themselves and they got promoted yeah that does happen yep there's
[01:55:03] no doubt about it it it happens less than you would think a lot of times that transparency that these
[01:55:10] idiots would have looking out for themselves and trying to make those maneuvers everyone would see
[01:55:14] it maybe I know you're not getting promoted but it did happen there are grounds for thinking that
[01:55:21] incompetent commanders tend to be those whom the need to avoid failure exceeds the urge to succeed
[01:55:29] according to JWAK and T-feather such people tend to issue activities which they may show up in a
[01:55:36] poor light and unless forced to so refrain from taking on any skilled task where there are any doubts
[01:55:42] about the outcome so people that are just concerned about themselves they'll only go into jobs where
[01:55:47] they know they're going to win that's what they're trying to do they're just they're only doing
[01:55:52] jobs of things that they know they're going to do if no one's going to win that here in lies
[01:55:56] especially lemma though they need to achieve it is the very nature of trying which exposes them to
[01:56:03] that which they fear most failure they are like people who try to climb mountains out of an
[01:56:09] underlying fear of heights it would not be surprising to find that such people are attracted to
[01:56:15] and prosper in the armed services for one place it carefully in the military and contrast the
[01:56:22] world of commerce offers achievement without tears stick to the rule book do nothing while
[01:56:27] explicit approval from the next higher up always confirm form never offend your superiors
[01:56:34] and you will float serenely if a trifle slowly upward a blip in both senses of the word
[01:56:39] that's the reality you can you there you can do that you can join the military and you can just
[01:56:49] kind of keep your nose clean stay low profile don't take any additional risks conform
[01:56:55] and you will get promoted over time in many cases Marine Corps tighter though I think
[01:57:00] I'd like to think that I mean you just described what you're describing I can I'm
[01:57:03] he's right yeah and I've seen it and not not right on the blanket statement no no no no it certainly happens
[01:57:11] yes yeah no correct and and you're right in saying like that's part of the system is is you have
[01:57:17] you might show for this altruism of how it works and the wrong people get promoted sometimes
[01:57:21] now it's not a lot of those people's actually a small number like you said but it happens enough
[01:57:25] that you will see it you're not going to go a career and go oh I never saw that every single time
[01:57:29] it was the right person of the right reasons no throughout my career there was examples that I
[01:57:33] can reflect back on it's a small number but the system doesn't work perfectly and I think the
[01:57:39] thing I was thinking about and this is military I think in general there are enough jobs in the
[01:57:43] military that have been done enough times that the template is there that you know I can take those
[01:57:49] set orders and like man it's really low risk you know cookie cutter job that's been done
[01:57:55] I can take the template jocos going off to me here's the you know here's the script follow the
[01:58:00] script low profile low risk you're going to look good in the end and you're going to get promoted there
[01:58:06] there are those jobs out there I was lucky in my career to have jobs that either I've never been
[01:58:12] done before or really that it wasn't a lot of history behind them so you know I'm remembering
[01:58:18] a couple times like when I was in command of an organization where you know I was being told hey
[01:58:24] if this fails it's going to destroy the whole thing like oh that's okay that's awesome I think I've
[01:58:29] told the story before I'm far enough away from it now that I can I can tell it if I haven't before
[01:58:33] but when I took over the first F 35 squadron the Marine Corps Z-35 program was on probation
[01:58:39] like they were contemplating canceling the F-35 for the Marine Corps the B variant which was the Marine
[01:58:44] Corps variant and the Marine Corps had already long since committed to that was the only platform
[01:58:48] there was no plan B there was no alternative to that so if we were going to lose the F-35 B the
[01:58:52] Marine Corps was going to lose tack air and as soon as I took command and you know I stood up
[01:58:59] I told you there's a guy there before no airplanes but when I took command they were playing
[01:59:01] started to arrive right when I got there the comment on the Marine Corps came down
[01:59:06] spent like an hour with me they met him at the squadron it was he and a sergeant major and me and
[01:59:10] my sergeant major and he goes hey I hate to tell you this but you can't crash in airplane
[01:59:15] like wow that's
[01:59:17] Roger that Roger that you know what I mean like if you crash in airplane
[01:59:22] we're going to lose the program we're in going to lose that air and so you're talking about
[01:59:26] the the balance of the risk of losing is a lot you know the balance that between the benefit
[01:59:32] of winning well yeah I'll just you know margin benefit of winning but like there's zero risk
[01:59:36] or you know the flip side is hey if I go two years of squadron commander everything goes great
[01:59:40] I'm going to get a firm handshake and I congratulations and life's going to go on but nobody's
[01:59:44] going to credit me for doing anything remarkable because the system is the the program is just
[01:59:48] moving along where it where it needs to go but if I screwed up you know that downside risk and
[01:59:53] and I understand the the aversion to that like hey would rather have a guaranteed win with you
[01:59:59] know a guaranteed marginal win with no chance of losing or high risk of failure but this is a
[02:00:07] once in a lifetime thing that would need the right person the right time to go through that a lot
[02:00:10] of people are averse to that yep well and this is the other scary thing about that is
[02:00:15] so you're the squadron commander you get told don't crash any birds well
[02:00:20] how but we fly a little less right it's interesting to said that because in the exact same weekend
[02:00:26] the deputy common on for aviation the head aviator the Marine Corps said your number one job
[02:00:31] is to fly as much as you can possibly possible day Roger that okay and listen there's a part of
[02:00:37] it too that any you have to understand it's like there is nothing that I could do personally short
[02:00:42] of shutting down the squadron right to guarantee the one kind of there's nothing I can do that so
[02:00:48] there's a part of that like if you can just let that go is recognized my best chance of me being
[02:00:53] successful is to my commander is none of this yeah as opposed to try to make her manage all of it
[02:00:57] you know and that's such a good point because
[02:01:00] okay we can either fly as little as humanly possible which means everyone's paranoid no one really
[02:01:07] knows how to do job really like all right we're gonna fly these things we'll be awesome at it and that's
[02:01:11] the right call obviously not everyone would make that decision and even then they're still even
[02:01:17] the right call doesn't guarantee the outcome you go to everything right and you know what yeah you have
[02:01:21] a miss hop on me those things break yeah things break and mid flight yep that happens they do
[02:01:27] especially brand new airplanes just they're being designed while you're flying them those things happen
[02:01:32] how many f 35s have crashed not a lot so I believe I have to go back and look I think the first one
[02:01:41] crashed and my squadron like six months after I left yeah got out of the we've there's been a very small
[02:01:50] it's been a very safe airplane what is enough 35 cost at the time it was 130 million now
[02:01:57] it's probably 90 also they cut the price down well those first ones are like you know they were literally
[02:02:02] the very first ones off the assembly and so that that as you know like that mass production
[02:02:08] benefit hadn't continued so age one was kind of like a unique article now like their jammer
[02:02:13] amount they're making a bunch of them and and it's it's more cost effective I know these are crazy
[02:02:16] numbers but at the time they were they were expensive 133 a copy I had 14 and if you
[02:02:23] when you find an f 35 and you're doing a vertical how often did you a vertical take off
[02:02:31] like a short take off like the stole like the yeah like yeah like a hair year yeah
[02:02:36] not that often sometimes it's how much gas do you go through taking one of those things off vertically
[02:02:42] the vertical flying burns a ridiculous amount of gas do you just basically have to refuel us
[02:02:46] as soon as you get up it's not that bad but it's it's a lot of gas yeah the the landings are more
[02:02:53] of a critical because you're on the clock like you come in you gotta be relatively light you can't
[02:02:56] land like a fully loaded airplane vertically because it's too heavy okay so you gotta be like
[02:03:00] a certain limited amount of gas so the plane is light enough to hover but then again like you can't
[02:03:06] just sit there all day long because you don't have that much gas it's nothing like the
[02:03:10] hair year was those guys it was sketchy like really really sketchy but yeah you're burning a lot
[02:03:15] of gas a lot it was sketchy in a hair year what made it more sketchy less powerful airplane
[02:03:21] harder to fly less margin for air less you need less gas to be able to land and didn't have as
[02:03:27] much time you know just I figured I flew the hair year simulator out at Yuma yeah did I crash that they
[02:03:34] literally 17 tons of row I my total flight time was nine seconds just hope that I just
[02:03:39] cry out if you got to know enough 35 right now in the simulator I could over the shoulder you walk
[02:03:43] you through to you landed almost perfectly in the first drawing well that's like drones
[02:03:48] man those first drones came out that were like little model airplanes guys were just crashing
[02:03:53] everywhere and now a three year old confide drone and that's that's no such technology
[02:03:59] uh this thing says on the same note the net result would be a bi-modal distribution of officers
[02:04:07] at every grade so these two different types of officers you end up with them at every grade
[02:04:11] those who take risks and get away with it the Montgomerys and Lawrence is up this
[02:04:15] of this world and those who have plotted up the hard but safe way the good old boys you never
[02:04:20] speak out a turn who make up intact and conformity what they lack in enterprise and initiative
[02:04:27] interesting contemplation of a nept commander suggests that they were of the latter genre
[02:04:36] in the first place they were renowned almost without exception for being hypersensitive to
[02:04:40] criticism so those people that are the the the conformists high-percentive
[02:04:47] asked the question of physical bravery and no way to track from the feats of courage
[02:04:50] to note that the fear of being afraid the fear of social disemprovele for cowardice and most
[02:04:56] important the personal shame attendant upon flinching in the face of danger could drive a man
[02:05:00] to perform acts of valor far beyond the normal call of duty this is not to deny that bravery occurs
[02:05:05] for other reasons out of pure altruism or patriotism but merely that some individuals are so
[02:05:12] lacking in self-esteem that they will gladly exchange the fear of failure for their own physical
[02:05:16] destruction that's kind of a weird thing to say in a very real sense military organizations
[02:05:22] recognize and trade upon this fact of human nature death rather than dishonor is no empty
[02:05:28] platitude but formulates an essential and ancient feature of military i'll tell you what's a
[02:05:38] you would expand a little bit more which he doesn't what's scary about that is when people are
[02:05:43] being brave with other people's lives that that's what's jacked up look if you're brave
[02:05:49] and you go and do something heroic good on you i don't care what your motivation was i think
[02:05:53] same harris always talks about the fact that you can't you can't fake bravery right you run out
[02:05:59] in the street there's no fake in it you did it and that's that it doesn't matter if you
[02:06:04] thought it you were did it because you were going to be ashamed or you did it because you were just
[02:06:09] a hyper motivated or whatever it doesn't matter you can't fake it you were brave no no no no
[02:06:14] no question about it but when you start being brave with other people's lives that's a freaking
[02:06:18] disaster that's what these horrible leaders end up doing it cannot be emphasized too strong
[02:06:23] only that this suggested relationship between valor and the need to prove oneself a no way
[02:06:27] to base his bravery on the contrary takes the view that the best measure of courage is the
[02:06:33] fear that is overcome then these were the bravest of them all for his only by conquering
[02:06:39] rational fear that they could nullify fear of being afraid so there you go the tragedy of this
[02:06:44] issue is that if military organizations select their senior commanders for their physical
[02:06:50] as opposed to moral bravery they not only might ignore other equally important attributes
[02:06:56] but are bound to select a proportion of individuals whose underlying psychopathology is quite
[02:07:01] unfitted to positions of high command in this way they invite incompetence so just because someone's
[02:07:07] brave doesn't mean you want to put them in a leadership position doesn't say you don't want them
[02:07:11] there and there is certainly a huge benefit to someone that's been in combat and knows what's
[02:07:17] happening knows the understands the emotions and and the human nature that takes place on the front
[02:07:23] lines for sure that's highly beneficial shouldn't be the only reason you select somebody though
[02:07:31] the last trait of those who harbour a fear of failure concerns the selection of subordinates
[02:07:38] they're really two components to this process the first concerns the way an individual sees
[02:07:42] himself in comparison with his competitors in the second the way he thinks others will see him
[02:07:46] in comparison with his contemporaries in either case he may well try to elevate his own self
[02:07:53] estimation by choosing a low standard with which to make comparison hence the phenomenon of people
[02:08:00] who tend to shun the company of individuals more gifted and even choose workmates as select or select
[02:08:07] as subordinates people who may consider inferior to themselves a lot of freaking disaster that is
[02:08:14] so that's the person that wants to look good so hires a bunch of idiots talks a little bit
[02:08:20] about haig he talks about haig being painfully aware of his limitations haig was a world war
[02:08:25] one commander of burnish troops and then try to enter the one profession open to the dumps of the
[02:08:32] family of the army only to find that even nary failed to shine he got put into his position the
[02:08:37] reason he got promoted is because he got sort of a hook up from a family member his elder sister
[02:08:44] hen rea to new the Duke of Cambridge hooked him up with ventured entry to staff college then he was the
[02:08:50] aid to camp to the king do this guy's just making moves make and moves became respected for his
[02:08:58] conventional opinions that's crazy right you've become respected because you agree with everybody
[02:09:05] that's a great point king that's a hundred percent right king he said things like cavalry will have
[02:09:13] a larger sphere of action future wars artillery only seems to be really effective against raw
[02:09:20] troops these are just idiotic statements he also had a he was also prone to a steady
[02:09:29] denigration of his competitors and the removal of his superior care of superior commanders this
[02:09:34] guy was just a shit talker haig haig talent for finding fault with everybody but himself
[02:09:41] was particularly keen whenever results had resulted in military setback and he gives all these just
[02:09:47] crazy examples uh he put he blamed someone he's unfit to command a division at this critical
[02:09:55] purity of the operations in France and should only be employed at home by the way there's a
[02:09:59] people that are working for him by the way ralson is unsatisfactory loyalty to his subordinates
[02:10:05] but he has many other valuable qualities he's trying to get rid of somebody he's like guys he's
[02:10:11] as valuable qualities but he's overly loyalty to his troops seems impossible to discuss the military
[02:10:17] problems with and with an un-reasoning brain to his kind the fact is that surge on seems
[02:10:23] uncapable realizing the nature of the fighting that has been going on in the difficulties of
[02:10:28] getting fresh troops and stores forward an adequate communication trenches dug on Saturday
[02:10:32] October 19 made an impromptu report to oh this is uh on Saturday october 4th
[02:10:38] 19th haig this guy makes this report up his chain of command about the his commander
[02:10:45] surge on French what happens eventually French gets fired who gets put in charge haig
[02:10:56] haig got his wish reaching the pinnacle of the greatest army that the empire had ever put in the
[02:11:01] field in the past or was ever to amass in the future a body whose heroism and devotion was
[02:11:07] such that they could twice in two successive years be ravaged in hopeless offensive who were in
[02:11:13] a single day to lose more men than any other army in the history of the world whom after 27
[02:11:21] months of slaughter and exhaustion he was to leave so periously exposed that they were nearly annihilated
[02:11:28] just horrible and this uh section that will close out with for today
[02:11:39] says freedom of expression and cognitive process unfettered by inhibitions were not looked upon
[02:11:48] with favor in military personnel so that's a horrible situation it seems then that
[02:11:57] in the case of achievement motivation as with obsessive tendency military organizations attract
[02:12:05] and then reinforce those very characteristics which will prove and the theoretical
[02:12:12] to competent military performance it's uh again is that true in the military yes it is
[02:12:21] is it true in the civil or let me rephrase that I saw you're looking your face to have
[02:12:25] can it be true in the military yes it can can it attract people with these type of tendencies yes it
[02:12:29] can can it then provide opportunities for people to sort of just get on board with the system yes
[02:12:35] it can does the civilian sector do that as well how yes it does happens in any leadership situation
[02:12:43] where we take these things that we should be striving for like freedom of expression and
[02:12:48] unfettered cognitive processes meaning you should just be able to think and we crush them and
[02:12:57] you know I was thinking this uh we've been talking about the the the EO leadership loop
[02:13:04] and included not as the is the Udlu right these ideas of constantly running through your mind
[02:13:10] all these different aspects of leadership and the main list lesson that you and I put
[02:13:15] out this is what we've just put out the monster the main lesson when you're running these loops is
[02:13:18] not to get stuck is not to get stuck is to free your mind and that's how I close out the last
[02:13:26] podcast I said free your mind and I want to reiterate that you have to keep your mind open if your
[02:13:31] minds always stuck even it can be stuck by so many different things it can be stuck by your ego
[02:13:35] your insecurities it can be stuck by your fear it can be stuck by tradition it can be stuck by
[02:13:41] custom it can be stuck by the restraints of the institution that you're in if your mind is
[02:13:47] getting stuck like that you have to be weary you have to be afraid of that because if you let
[02:13:54] your mind get stuck in that fixed position you're gonna get flanked you're gonna get overrun
[02:14:01] and you're gonna get destroyed and if you're in a leadership position that is what's going to happen
[02:14:05] not just to you but to your troops so keep an open mind echo Charles yes what do you got
[02:14:18] that whole that part about like not taking risks of your failure like that kind of stuff like
[02:14:22] first of whatever reason it was making me think of like the jujitsu journey ascending with like
[02:14:31] getting belts and all this stuff so in the beginning yeah I sure a little of my specific but you
[02:14:37] can kind of see it where you know if you're focused on the belt you tend to be more like
[02:14:43] fear failure kind of approach to training and but if you're just like hey I'm in here to get better
[02:14:50] and learn and be humble take risks you would happen all this stuff compete and you know and the
[02:14:55] higher you get the better you'll become yeah but if you start let's say you get like I don't know
[02:15:02] purple about that feel like it's one of the benchmark balance right for sure kind of become
[02:15:08] that's like jujitsu puberty right there you know so a lot of people and it can vary from belt to
[02:15:13] belt for sure but sometimes they'll be like oh well I don't want to look bad as a purple belt
[02:15:17] so let's get less risk I'm not only trained with guys who I know that I won't you know do
[02:15:23] poorly again sir whatever you know and you can kind of fall into that trap but then you get people
[02:15:28] who they don't they don't think about that kind of stuff it's like the belt that's just a byproduct
[02:15:32] of my journey and I don't even think about that those of the guys that that just keep getting
[02:15:36] better yeah yeah I I thought you were actually going to bring up just like the entrepreneurial spirit
[02:15:42] and you know we work with a lot of companies in echelon front and the leaders that have taken
[02:15:47] risk and have broken outside the norm those are leaders that they end up doing exceptionally well
[02:15:54] right if they manage it well like look you can take big risks you can fail right that happens
[02:15:59] that's why they're called risks but if you want to look can you play at safe
[02:16:06] yes you can and you can do that in the corporate world to hey you can you can fall the rules
[02:16:10] and you can do you can and you can move up the chain and that's fine that's fine
[02:16:15] if you want to excel you're going to have to take some chances you're going to have to take some
[02:16:19] risks that's what you're going to have to do and and and then you do if you do utilize sort of the
[02:16:27] the standard sort of conformity to move up the chain what I will be I okay I get it but you know
[02:16:36] what don't suppress don't suppress risk for others don't don't don't suppress entrepreneurial
[02:16:45] thinking from other people inside your organization that's what I think we run into a real problem
[02:16:49] you know I kind of fall the rules and conformed and I got my promotion and then Dave comes along
[02:16:55] and he's a little bit more of a mistake or a little bit more entrepreneurial and this could be
[02:16:59] in the military this could be in the business sector and what do I do I don't rank him I shut
[02:17:03] him down I partially shut him down because I don't want him I don't want him to out out maneuver me
[02:17:08] so I'm just going to shut down on all these ideas I'm also going to shut him down because I don't
[02:17:12] want to take any risk so if you want to if you want to play that game for yourself and you don't
[02:17:20] want to take a bunch of risks and you just want to have a safe comfortable job that's okay that's
[02:17:24] not bad look if you work hard and and and you do a good job inside your business
[02:17:29] organization that's great I I actually like that I appreciate it but the minute you you have
[02:17:36] that attitude and you start to impose it on people around you you need to check yourself you
[02:17:41] need to check yourself because you're shutting down mind your closing minds and you're really
[02:17:46] in the long term hurt in your organization you were come across a situation it feels like it's
[02:17:52] feels like it's real common where you get to people they're going to business together one
[02:17:56] guys risk averse one guys like freaking try anything and they sort of start to balance each other
[02:18:02] for sure and not to mention there's some jobs that are kind of more conducive for certain attitude
[02:18:07] types yeah the risky guys like out doing the sales pitch and the other guys back in the
[02:18:11] compounds in the books yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[02:18:13] yeah so it is good to have business partners like that for sure yeah kind of real you in
[02:18:18] when you need it as long as they're not over bearing I guess right there you go there you go
[02:18:23] all right well we're trying to keep our minds open we're trying to improve ourselves mentally
[02:18:29] physically you know poll nine yards echo you got any suggestions yeah what you do I do we do
[02:18:35] well do actually we know you where go no I just want to make sure we're recording oh yeah
[02:18:43] those good thanks Dave by the way so what you got echo Charles what you got for us oh well you know
[02:18:49] we're all working out doing G2 I guess you know hopefully we should be I'm just saying you know
[02:18:55] it's one of those things it does to keep you on the path we're reading mental physical or everything
[02:19:01] right we want to leave by example I'll tell you that I want to make good decisions until you
[02:19:05] that so all right on this path we're on this path good decisions physical capability
[02:19:12] mental capability we'll say you did not tell us what it is yes and improvement yes we want to take risk
[02:19:18] but not too many risk check we want to take risk but not too big of risks okay
[02:19:23] okay so one thing you don't want to risk is your health tell you that thing you risk
[02:19:29] what did you write that little setup right there I just came out with you so you
[02:19:33] speak in a mental security look at you look at that guy anyway you said all that stuff
[02:19:40] just to say we don't take too many risks with our health there you go it's just tying it in
[02:19:44] through if you don't get all together man I'm just saying it's freaking impressive not the thing to
[02:19:49] take risk with the hell yeah for the support juggle okay so we got energy drinks those
[02:19:58] might we got energy drinks not old school energy drinks that do risk your health we have energy
[02:20:03] drinks that don't risk your health that actually improve your health no risk upside across the
[02:20:08] board cross the board no gambling or upside across the board yes right if I was to say hey this
[02:20:13] thing over here can make you feel good yeah and you were like okay cool and it not only can
[02:20:18] it make you feel good it can actually make you be more healthy yeah what would you say to that
[02:20:24] that's a cool that's do you say cool what if I had something else over here and I was like this
[02:20:28] will also make you feel good for a little bit and you said okay that sounds good but then I said after
[02:20:33] that you're going to be addicted to it and you're going to end up becoming a crystal math
[02:20:38] and fed me addict and dying yes that would be best downside yes sir that's downside so we like
[02:20:44] the little we like the little hype that we got from the crystal math that that I gave you
[02:20:49] sure but then the downside is like a disaster you're teeth are falling out you lost your job
[02:20:54] there's all kinds of problems in the future that is true yes so I'm not going to sell you that
[02:20:58] no I'm not going to want you to take that you're not going to recommend that you're correct
[02:21:02] but I've got something else over here yes it's going to give you that hype yes with zero
[02:21:07] downside all hype zero downside and this is I will not find you at a you know a meth lab
[02:21:13] slicking the floor which is what I'm afraid of if I give you the other thing that is an
[02:21:18] undesirable outcome yes sir so yes so when you're choosing energy drink you look
[02:21:23] over energy drink even if not even into energy drinks necessarily and I understand if you're not
[02:21:29] because really how could you be when you consider those yes yes now we got a solution for that
[02:21:34] yeah straight up all healthy energy drink completely good for you jockel discipline go yeah
[02:21:40] my jockel it's a good one uh taste good two different flavors so far the apparently on paper
[02:21:48] the more popular one is orange afterburner orange afterburner orange Dave Burr good deal
[02:21:54] days signature flavor on paper is good it's makes sense you know like if you don't know if you're
[02:21:59] not in the know you go you you you have a awesome selection you know you know that the orange is
[02:22:04] going to come through wouldn't you agree yes yeah I feel the same way I feel the same way but you
[02:22:10] want to take a little bit more risk right maybe a higher up side maybe bringing the
[02:22:16] thread to the wall for the baby look I don't know I don't know I'm just a person but hey
[02:22:21] maybe though you take a little bit more risk on a more exotic flavor like mango
[02:22:26] mango passion fruit to be specific you might wind up with that bigger upside I don't know
[02:22:31] that's up to you but nonetheless there are many different flavors of choose whichever one all of
[02:22:36] them are all upside no downside so it doesn't matter technically at the end of their what flavor
[02:22:40] you choose that's for your own personal choice so get some of that discipline go well
[02:22:47] so got joint warfare acrylic oil we got the discipline powder we got some new what what do you call
[02:22:53] hype well they're not technically called hype I think they're called pre workout mixes powers
[02:23:01] so so we've had the discipline powder for a while just called discipline and it didn't have
[02:23:07] much caffeine in it to be real specific and people are like hey that's cool we appreciate it but
[02:23:13] sometimes we want more of a kick so we didn't go nuts we didn't go 700 milligrams of caffeine
[02:23:20] yeah do you know the number 95 95 per scoop okay okay per scoop okay so that's more moderate I would say
[02:23:27] oh it then it's moderate unless you have two scoops or three scoops right which is which is
[02:23:32] because gay the classic pre workout if you go two scoops that's too much right it's too much
[02:23:39] yeah but at the same time if you if you don't want to get all nuts whether you got to start
[02:23:42] meticulously putting only a little bit of powder you can't really bet you know so I dig it so yeah
[02:23:46] that that makes sense put if you need 300 milligrams of caffeine before one workout if that's what you need
[02:23:52] oh no it's I'm not hey dig it man I dig it like you just have three scoops you
[02:23:57] yeah I would say back off a little bit that's my personal generally speaking but here's the
[02:24:02] thing also do some abstinence days right yeah yes like on the weekend you know whatever on
[02:24:09] month whatever some days be like yeah I'm not gonna have any at all yeah any caffeine at all
[02:24:13] generally speaking I feel like that's a good move anyway did not go every single day whatever like
[02:24:18] give yourself a break whatever and that way you maximize the effects anyway that's what I'm talking
[02:24:23] about yeah sir I think you're right about that but you've never really been that hard current
[02:24:27] because let's face it a pre workout it gives you like a bigger pump yeah no I've pre workout really
[02:24:34] is my thing the own unless you count due to you as a workout which we've had this discussion lately
[02:24:39] that's not really a workout but like I would have disciplined powder before going to the jujitsu
[02:24:45] right and I still will do that but as far as I'm just rolling in with a freaking pump in hard
[02:24:52] I'm not really down for that with a dream and that's technically that's not why we take pre
[02:24:57] workout too for workouts like jujitsu jujitsu I I consider jujitsu workout that's a hard workout actually
[02:25:02] it's harder workout technically it's for the output goes most of the time more than your average
[02:25:07] other workout just hand on the workout obviously but let's say if you're going in you're going to do
[02:25:15] eight sets of 12 with some bench and then maybe some try-sev extensions curls this kind of thing
[02:25:21] you take a pre workout that's that's the jam you say that's it so we made one of these for people
[02:25:27] like echo Charles I want to get it all it's a disciplined go powder you available now
[02:25:34] you know it may go bad yeah you get some mango other flavors more if you need some protein tastes like
[02:25:39] dessert one of the best things that have ever been invented I'm expecting probably they have a
[02:25:45] noble prize for dessert no they have a noble prize for protein chicks well now you know I
[02:25:53] not that I'm aware of that you know let's face it there should be one yes and actually more
[02:25:57] than you know really because they like okay you know you heard of people making like a moch pancakes
[02:26:01] you know the stuff okay here's the jam keep this in mind do this moch shake frozen banana the whole
[02:26:09] jam whole creaminess that's all see all that right so so make make that when the kids are at
[02:26:14] looking then you buy those little popsicle what are you called for you you know the ones right
[02:26:19] they can make popsicles in and you make popsicles then you tell the kids hey like have a surprise for
[02:26:26] you after dinner because you know you dinner are all good right I have a surprise sake of cool they're
[02:26:29] excited you bust out that pop it looks like one of those pudding pops yeah you seem saying so that's
[02:26:35] what you've been doing no I'm gonna do it yeah but if you say and that's a good idea so say all right
[02:26:41] that's the moch no bell prize running moch white jocco i teach by the way you can get the stuff you
[02:26:48] can get the drinks out walla you can get the stuff at vitamin shop or you can get it from jocco fuel
[02:26:52] dot com if you subscribe to any of it you get free shipping which is a which is a total bonus oh yeah
[02:26:58] and you don't remember to take all that stuff so so good also origin USA this American made stuff
[02:27:05] products goods jeans boots American made denim and doesn't get much American made that not
[02:27:14] you could just say American American but it's sad that the American iconic jeans that you have
[02:27:19] aren't even made in America not you but I mean us we as a nation a lot of people are out there
[02:27:24] wearing jeans they think or made in America yeah they're not made in America they're um they're
[02:27:29] pitched yeah they might be packaged in America but really there's communist that are making
[02:27:34] the juice and it's nothing against the people but the government has those people enslaved
[02:27:43] so we we're not for that we're against that you know I saw you compete on the new
[02:27:49] the other day no yeah we're doing yeah we're out there this are you know where the story

[02:28:11] that I feel like I don't like it either I feel like I do I take offense to it maybe maybe not
[02:28:17] but I feel like they're kind of pronouncing my name wrong it's weird that you would do that it says
[02:28:22] will ink that's literally what it says yes how you reverse those numbers and or worse those
[02:28:27] letters and stuff I don't know but that's what happens and I don't know you start to want to have you
[02:28:31] have they not heard anyone else say your name ever yeah it's strange it is odd right kind of strange
