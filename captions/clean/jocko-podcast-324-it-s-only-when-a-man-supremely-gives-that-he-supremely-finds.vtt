00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 324 with Eccletrails and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Eccle.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening. Also joining us. Again, tonight is Jason Gardner. Good evening, Jason.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good evening Eccle. Good evening, Eccle. Good evening, Jockel.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So we rolled in, we're talking about this book and a middle of a dissection of the life of Colonel Joshua, Chamberlain,

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or General Joshua Chamberlain, the hero of Little Round Top, the 20th main who did a bunch of other things in his life.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.000
One of the parts of this book that Jason, we were talking about before we got started was this letter from Joshua Chamberlain to Governor Coburn.

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
He's from headquarters 20th main volunteers in the field, July 21st, 1863. And here's what Joshua Chamberlain says.

8
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And this gives you such a keen insight into his leadership and leadership. Dear Governor, I embrace a rare opportunity,

9
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
namely a day's halt within a few miles of our baggage to write you in reference to the affairs of our regimen in which I am well aware.

10
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You feel the deepest interest. In the first place, allow me to thank you for the honor you have done me in entrusting my care, in entrusting to my care, this noble regimen.

11
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I trust I shall be always worthy of the confidence you have thus placed in me. I consider it an officer's first duty to look after the welfare of his men.

12
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:55.000
To this, he is bound no less by the responsibility which the arbitrary nature of his power imposes than by the regard he should have to the interests of the service in which he is engaged.

13
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:13.000
My experience in several trying campaigns has taught me that the way to ensure the efficiency of the army is to keep the men in the best possible condition physically and mentally.

14
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So, take care of your people and your people will take care of you. So we used to say about our gear. Take care of your gear and your gear will take care of you because you know you've got your parachute.

15
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You've got your dive ready you'll get your weapon take care of your weapon and take care of you. Take care of your people and your people are going to take care of you.

16
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Without the people, there is no mission. There is no mission. That balance which occasionally gets brought out. How do you balance it? What's more important? The people are the missions.

17
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.44
the people, without the people there's no mission. And if you have one mission that you're

18
00:02:49.44 --> 00:02:54.72
going to do, I guess you can put the mission above the people, which are not going to be in that

19
00:02:54.72 --> 00:03:05.68
situation, you're not. So the people come first. And by the way, this is important. If there's

20
00:03:05.68 --> 00:03:14.000
alignment in what you're doing, what your mission is should help the people. So when you're in combat

21
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.96
and you're going out and you're taking the fight to the enemy, well, guess what? Now you can win the

22
00:03:18.96 --> 00:03:24.80
war. Now you can get the people home to their families. Now we can protect the world from fascism

23
00:03:24.80 --> 00:03:29.76
or from Nazism or from the Imperial Japanese Army or from communism. That's what these things are doing.

24
00:03:29.76 --> 00:03:34.16
So when you're out there soldier, you're taking care of your people by helping to win the war.

25
00:03:34.16 --> 00:03:40.24
Those should be aligned. That's why you had disalignment or on alignment in Vietnam or people

26
00:03:40.24 --> 00:03:44.08
saying, hey, what is that? Leaning me, aren't doing anything to me. I don't care if this is communist

27
00:03:44.08 --> 00:03:49.76
or not. It doesn't affect me. And so we're not aligned. It's a problem. Some people that people that

28
00:03:49.76 --> 00:03:53.52
were saying, hey, we believe in the domino theory, we think it's all going to fall down. We need to

29
00:03:53.52 --> 00:03:57.68
stop communism here. Those people were aligned and were proactively fighting the war.

30
00:03:57.68 --> 00:04:04.88
Some people weren't. Same thing in a company. If I am trying to build a factory

31
00:04:05.84 --> 00:04:10.08
so that I can take my people and put them in a better situation where they have better working

32
00:04:10.08 --> 00:04:17.84
conditions, it's going to help them. If I'm trying to get my team to sell more widgets, well,

33
00:04:17.84 --> 00:04:21.92
Jason, how many widgets did you sell on the sold three? Well, hey, Jason, you just sell more. Why?

34
00:04:22.32 --> 00:04:26.72
Well, because I want you to be able to save money for college for your kids. Oh, okay. Yeah.

35
00:04:26.72 --> 00:04:33.12
So the better you do, the better we do, the better we do, the better you do. Because by the way,

36
00:04:33.12 --> 00:04:38.000
when you sell more widgets, we and echo sells more widgets. Now we can produce more widgets. That

37
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.68
lowers our cost to produce. Now we can lower our prices. So you can sell even more widgets. So we can

38
00:04:41.68 --> 00:04:47.04
so the mission and the men should be aligned. The mission and the people should be aligned. The

39
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:52.80
goals should help. If what I'm doing is saying, hey, Jason, sell more widgets. And you say, why?

40
00:04:52.80 --> 00:05:00.72
And I say, because I want to line my pockets more, what, we're not aligned. We're not aligned.

41
00:05:00.72 --> 00:05:05.04
But if I'm saying, hey, sell more widgets. So we can lower the price point. So you can have more job

42
00:05:05.04 --> 00:05:09.52
security. So you can, you know, buy good, get it down payment for your house. All those things.

43
00:05:09.52 --> 00:05:12.72
We want things to be aligned. When they're not aligned, that's where we're now problems.

44
00:05:14.08 --> 00:05:19.84
Taking care of your people is not letting them come in late and leave early. Or letting them fall

45
00:05:19.84 --> 00:05:26.80
sort of the standards. And so that's really interesting. I like how we're broken out. And I think

46
00:05:26.80 --> 00:05:31.52
I'm going to laugh chapters of steel. My soul just heart reads warning guys about being popular.

47
00:05:31.52 --> 00:05:35.68
And folks want to be popular. Oh, yeah, I'll just let them smoke cigarettes because they want

48
00:05:35.68 --> 00:05:41.60
to smoke cigarettes on watch and then crack. Oh, they get killed. Being popular is not taking

49
00:05:41.60 --> 00:05:47.76
care of your people. And when you try to maintain a standard, you're making them better people by

50
00:05:47.76 --> 00:05:55.44
bringing them up to a stand. It helps them. It helps them stay alive. The the contrary to that

51
00:05:55.44 --> 00:06:01.84
is, or the opposite dichotomy of that is, hey, I'm just going to impose my rules on these people.

52
00:06:01.84 --> 00:06:05.04
They're not going to know why. They're not going to know how it helps them. They're not going to

53
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:12.32
know that smoking in a watch position at night can get you killed by a sniper. So instead, you just

54
00:06:12.32 --> 00:06:18.16
mandate these rules. And if you, hey, I don't care, from popular or not. That's not a good attitude

55
00:06:18.16 --> 00:06:24.32
to have. If you're not, look, you shouldn't be doing things to be popular. But if people don't like

56
00:06:24.32 --> 00:06:31.04
you, that work for you, that's also a problem. That's also a problem. And if that, what I just said,

57
00:06:31.04 --> 00:06:34.72
makes you shudder a little bit and thinking, you know, I'm not sure if I'm on board that. You need to

58
00:06:34.72 --> 00:06:41.68
check yourself quite frankly. You need to check yourself. I haven't worked for a leader that was a good

59
00:06:41.68 --> 00:06:47.04
leader where everyone said, yeah, I don't like that guy. They might say something like, hey, man,

60
00:06:47.04 --> 00:06:56.24
he can be a bit hard. But he makes sense. But he's doing it for the right reasons. But sometimes

61
00:06:56.24 --> 00:07:02.16
we're a little bit too slack. The leader that, hey, we all hate him, but we're going to do what he says.

62
00:07:02.16 --> 00:07:07.28
Doesn't really exist, man. No, at least you're not going to do it to the best of your ability,

63
00:07:07.28 --> 00:07:13.52
right? When I think about all those leaders that I worked hard for because I was like, I worked

64
00:07:13.52 --> 00:07:17.76
hard for this leader because I was worried he was going to yell at me. He got this much effort out of

65
00:07:17.76 --> 00:07:24.40
me. The leader that I worked hardest for was the person that I was terrified of disappointing,

66
00:07:24.96 --> 00:07:31.84
like Delta Charlie. Yeah. Yeah. And why, why in the world was I terrified of disappointing Delta

67
00:07:31.84 --> 00:07:38.08
Charlie and every other leader that I put in that category, it's because they treated me with respect.

68
00:07:38.88 --> 00:07:44.08
That's all you got to do. So, treat everybody with respect and then your life is going to be that

69
00:07:44.08 --> 00:07:47.84
much easier, especially your subordinates because they're going to work hard for you because it

70
00:07:47.84 --> 00:07:52.72
will be terrified of disappointing you. Yeah. And then, okay, well, what if they're just going to take

71
00:07:52.72 --> 00:07:55.76
advantage of you? Guess what? There's going to be some people that are going to try. They're going

72
00:07:55.76 --> 00:07:58.96
to be, you got a team of 20 people. There's going to be two or three of them that are looking

73
00:07:58.96 --> 00:08:03.20
to cut corners looking to slack off. That's true. It's true in a seal puttune for crying out loud.

74
00:08:03.20 --> 00:08:09.04
In a seal puttune where they go through hell week and they go through buds and they're highly

75
00:08:09.04 --> 00:08:12.24
selecting all that stuff. Yeah. Some of those people get to a puttune and they don't want to do shit.

76
00:08:13.68 --> 00:08:18.08
They want to freaking cut quarters. They want to go home early. They don't care. That's what

77
00:08:18.08 --> 00:08:22.000
happens. You get those guys and puttune and they're not going to, they might not commit hanging

78
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.40
offenses. They might not like skip work or leave their weapon unattended or something like that.

79
00:08:30.40 --> 00:08:34.88
Which, okay, if they're that bad, you can get rid of them but they know where the line is

80
00:08:34.88 --> 00:08:41.44
and they just they just tiptoe on that line. And so there's people like that. There's people like

81
00:08:41.44 --> 00:08:49.04
that in every organization. And if you then treat everyone in your organization as if they're that

82
00:08:49.04 --> 00:08:53.04
person that's trying to get away with what they can and that's how you treat everyone. You're not

83
00:08:53.04 --> 00:08:56.48
treating them with respect. You're micromanaging them and it's going to come back and haunt you.

84
00:08:57.28 --> 00:09:04.48
What's so here's an interesting thing. It's like sometimes sometimes I'm weak and I'm that guy

85
00:09:04.48 --> 00:09:12.80
trying to leverage a friendship against the standard. And then when a leader is like, no bro,

86
00:09:12.80 --> 00:09:19.52
you got to do it this way. I don't lose respect for them. Check. I'll be in a week.

87
00:09:19.52 --> 00:09:24.88
Again after it. I want examples of bro. What's the example of that?

88
00:09:26.88 --> 00:09:33.28
That's a good boy. I'll shoot. Like, um, one to come in late.

89
00:09:33.68 --> 00:09:40.56
Oh yeah. You know, or like, uh, maybe it maybe on this dive, I should be the dot and here,

90
00:09:40.56 --> 00:09:47.36
here's a secret for everybody. Seals don't like diving. And so guys will try and wiggle out of it

91
00:09:47.36 --> 00:09:53.20
and find other things to do and stuff like that. And so I know at times that I've tried to wiggle

92
00:09:53.20 --> 00:09:57.20
out of a dive and then I'll get that leader. Just all I got to do is raise their eyebrows.

93
00:09:57.92 --> 00:10:02.56
Maybe they say something like bro. Yeah. Really? Yeah. No, really.

94
00:10:04.56 --> 00:10:07.92
That's like that story. That's all about delta Charlie. So delta Charlie's a guy I wrote about

95
00:10:07.92 --> 00:10:11.52
leadership strategy and tactics. He's a guy that I work for in my second puto and you work for him at

96
00:10:11.52 --> 00:10:18.88
trade at just like everyone just a universal respect, admiration and love for the guy. But we we had

97
00:10:18.88 --> 00:10:24.64
done a hydrographic reconnaissance. It on red beach like with for the Marines. And you know, it's

98
00:10:24.64 --> 00:10:28.96
all night or freaking waves for huge. We got our asses kicked. It's freezing. We go back. We make the

99
00:10:28.96 --> 00:10:34.000
chart in the middle of night, blah blah blah. And then the Marines landed. So we support their landing

100
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.28
and they didn't like their landing. It didn't go the way they wanted it to. So Marines like we're

101
00:10:37.28 --> 00:10:41.76
doing it again. So everyone went back to the ships and they're like, okay, well, seals. You got to

102
00:10:41.76 --> 00:10:46.48
do the hydrographic on again. And we're all like, oh, whatever. I mean, okay. So we launch the boats and

103
00:10:47.28 --> 00:10:53.12
we're kind of in the wall. Like we have all the information. We've already done the charts. We've

104
00:10:53.12 --> 00:11:01.44
done the graphs. And someone thank God it wasn't me. Is like, hey, are we actually going to do this

105
00:11:01.44 --> 00:11:10.08
recon and Delta Charlie's like, well, we don't have to. And then he says, but would that be the right

106
00:11:10.08 --> 00:11:16.24
thing to do? It was like, oh, I'm like, I'm so glad I didn't say it. I don't want it to do. It's freaking

107
00:11:16.24 --> 00:11:21.92
freezing dude. It's freezing. It's going to be a four hour evolution kicking through the surf and

108
00:11:21.92 --> 00:11:25.76
like being that guy. And actually, this wasn't me because I was a radio man. So I was in the boat with

109
00:11:25.76 --> 00:11:30.96
the GPS like marking our spots. So I wasn't the one that's going to suffer. But the number four man

110
00:11:30.96 --> 00:11:35.36
or five man that's getting pounded by four foot waves for an hour as we do a freaking

111
00:11:35.76 --> 00:11:41.84
perp and or no parallel recon off the flutter board. I hate to admit it. But I've had to

112
00:11:41.84 --> 00:11:47.04
heard swimmer scouts in like three times before I actually rolled out of the boat. Because I

113
00:11:47.04 --> 00:11:52.32
didn't want to because I was so cold. It's from skeleton. Okay. It was a close circuit. It was a

114
00:11:52.32 --> 00:11:58.48
little closer. Get in. Okay. So that's why we take care of our people. That's what we're talking

115
00:11:58.48 --> 00:12:05.60
about with this incredible leader Joshua Chamberlain. It's a bunch of examples too. We'll hit

116
00:12:05.60 --> 00:12:10.40
up where you're just treating his guys with the most respect. Yeah. And I mean, just look at the

117
00:12:10.40 --> 00:12:16.32
way on the last podcast. We talked about the way he treated mute nears. The way he treated

118
00:12:16.32 --> 00:12:22.32
prisoner mute nears with respect. Listen to what they had to say. Said, okay, I got your back.

119
00:12:22.32 --> 00:12:26.24
And as soon as he said, he was going to take care of them. They took care of him. So

120
00:12:26.24 --> 00:12:35.36
take nothing else away. Freaking take care of your people. Going back to the book here. This is

121
00:12:35.36 --> 00:12:41.04
this is from a where starts talking about military operations on the white oak road. The operations

122
00:12:41.04 --> 00:12:45.20
of the fifth core on the white oak road. And once again, this is after he's coming back from

123
00:12:46.72 --> 00:12:53.04
five months of recovery and getting sent back from line after he got shot hit the hip arteries

124
00:12:53.04 --> 00:12:57.68
blown apart. He's just stuck away. Yeah. And then it gets hospitalized. It gets sneaks away

125
00:12:57.68 --> 00:13:05.76
to get back to the front. Fifth core on the white oak road, 31st of March 1865,

126
00:13:06.72 --> 00:13:14.64
were more serious in purpose and action than has generally been understood. He says, and again,

127
00:13:14.64 --> 00:13:19.84
we're trying, I'm trying not to try. I'm trying not to talk through the entire scheme of maneuver

128
00:13:19.84 --> 00:13:26.96
on these things. It's much easier to do that visually than through the audio format. But just to give

129
00:13:26.96 --> 00:13:34.24
you some general understanding of the scenario, Lee's army during the previous winter had become

130
00:13:34.24 --> 00:13:39.68
much weakened by lack of supplies, desertions, and general demoralization of the Confederate

131
00:13:39.68 --> 00:13:45.04
cause and Grant was determined to take decisive measures to break the whole Confederate hold on

132
00:13:45.04 --> 00:13:52.80
Virginia. He planned a vigorous movement to cut Lee's communications and also those of Richmond

133
00:13:52.80 --> 00:13:58.64
and at the same time to turn the right flank of Lee's entrenched line before Peter's burrck

134
00:13:58.64 --> 00:14:05.20
and break up his army. Again, the reason we're still talking about Peter's burrck, which we talked

135
00:14:05.20 --> 00:14:09.68
about on the last podcast is because that's a nine months of entrenched warfare of trench warfare.

136
00:14:09.68 --> 00:14:17.20
The scope of grants intentions may be understood from an extract from his orders to Sheridan.

137
00:14:18.72 --> 00:14:22.96
So now we're talking about General Grant on March 28, 1865. He says,

138
00:14:22.96 --> 00:14:28.72
the fifth army corps will move by Vaughn Road at 3 a.m. tomorrow morning. The second moves at about

139
00:14:28.72 --> 00:14:36.32
9 a.m. move your cavalry as at as early an hour as you can and passing two or through

140
00:14:36.32 --> 00:14:43.76
didn't witty reach the height and rear of the enemy as soon as you can. It is not the intention

141
00:14:43.76 --> 00:14:49.76
to attack the enemy in his entrenched position, but to force him out if possible. Should he come

142
00:14:49.76 --> 00:14:57.84
out an attack us or get himself where he can be attacked move in with your entire force in your own way

143
00:14:59.44 --> 00:15:05.28
and with the full alliance that the army will engage or follow the enemy as circumstances will dictate.

144
00:15:05.28 --> 00:15:09.60
So the reason I wanted to point out this orders because think about this is really good decentralized

145
00:15:09.60 --> 00:15:15.52
command. Hey, do this in your own way. Figure it out. I don't care and we'll back you up. Cover move.

146
00:15:17.44 --> 00:15:21.52
I shall be with you on the field and we'll probably be able to communicate with you.

147
00:15:22.72 --> 00:15:29.12
That's that's not a great calm square. I'll probably be able to communicate with you. Guess what?

148
00:15:29.12 --> 00:15:34.88
Should I not do so and you find that the enemy keeps within his main entrenched line you may cut loose

149
00:15:35.28 --> 00:15:42.08
and push for the Danville road? If you find it practical, I would like you to cross the south side

150
00:15:42.08 --> 00:15:48.000
road between Peter'sburg and Berksville and destroy it to some extent after having accomplished

151
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.48
the destruction of the two railroads which are now the only avenues of supply to Lee's army. You may

152
00:15:54.48 --> 00:16:03.28
return to this army or go into North Carolina and join General Sherman. So very broad strategic guidance

153
00:16:03.28 --> 00:16:09.20
about what he wants done. Plenty of decentralized command happening there. It's good stuff.

154
00:16:10.16 --> 00:16:14.64
In his personal letter to General Sherman of March 22nd giving the details of his plans for

155
00:16:14.64 --> 00:16:20.40
Sheridan's movements, he adds, I shall start out with no distinct view further than holding

156
00:16:20.40 --> 00:16:24.96
Lee's forces from following Sheridan. That's the only thing he's trying to do. That's a great

157
00:16:24.96 --> 00:16:29.60
this is when we talk about commanders intent. That's the commanders intent right there. I got no

158
00:16:29.60 --> 00:16:33.44
distinct view other than holding Lee's forces from following Chega. That's what I'm going to do.

159
00:16:34.80 --> 00:16:40.40
But I shall be along myself and we'll take advantage of anything that turns up. These are flexible,

160
00:16:41.04 --> 00:16:49.52
good plans. Fast forward a little bit. Our whole division had arrived at the

161
00:16:49.52 --> 00:16:57.92
chapel, the Shappel house. When at about noon my command was ordered to retrace its steps by the Vaughan

162
00:16:57.92 --> 00:17:03.92
to the Quaker Road and push up toward the salient of the enemy's works near Burgess Mill.

163
00:17:04.96 --> 00:17:09.44
Again, if you want to pull out a map, go pull out a map and you can see exactly what that means.

164
00:17:09.44 --> 00:17:14.000
All this stuff is so well documented. Fording the run and forcing the position, we soon

165
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.76
developed a strong line which had entrenched itself as an advanced post to cover the important

166
00:17:19.76 --> 00:17:27.92
point at Burgess Mill. After stubborn fighting for over two hours, involving a loss to

167
00:17:27.92 --> 00:17:35.68
us of 167 killed and wounded, including some of our most valued officers. I don't know why he

168
00:17:35.68 --> 00:17:41.52
doesn't. He doesn't describe that battle in much detail in this section. Other than the destruction

169
00:17:41.52 --> 00:17:46.48
it was caused, including some of our most valued officers and a much heavier loss to the enemy,

170
00:17:46.96 --> 00:17:54.56
of whom more than 100 killed and 50 wounded with 160 prisoners taken by a sudden countercharge,

171
00:17:54.56 --> 00:18:00.32
fell into our hands. We pushed the enemy quite back to the white oak road and into their

172
00:18:00.32 --> 00:18:08.96
entrenchments behind it. On the 13th, the fifth corps, relieved by the second, moved to the left

173
00:18:08.96 --> 00:18:15.12
along Boiton Road advancing. It's left towards the right of the enemy's entrenchments on white

174
00:18:15.12 --> 00:18:21.52
oak road. Lee also apprehensive for his right sent McGowan South Carolina Brigade and MacRays North

175
00:18:21.52 --> 00:18:27.44
Carolina of Hillscore to strengthen Bushrod Johnson's division in the entrenchments there.

176
00:18:28.72 --> 00:18:35.52
So again, trying to set this up a little bit for you. The precise details of these orders and

177
00:18:35.52 --> 00:18:40.72
movements were of course not known to General Grant. So General Lee's got stuff going on which

178
00:18:40.72 --> 00:18:44.80
you know, just heard me kind of lay out of course General Grant doesn't know what's happening.

179
00:18:45.60 --> 00:18:51.52
But enough had been developed on the Quaker Road to lead Grant to change materially. His original

180
00:18:51.52 --> 00:18:56.56
purpose of making the destruction of the railroads, the principal objective of shared in his movements.

181
00:18:57.20 --> 00:19:04.24
At the close of our fight there Grant had dispatched Sheridan, our line is now unbroken from

182
00:19:04.24 --> 00:19:12.80
apimatics to DynWitty. I feel I now feel like ending the matter if possible before going back.

183
00:19:12.80 --> 00:19:17.52
I do not want you there for to cut loose and go after the enemy's roads at present.

184
00:19:18.24 --> 00:19:23.04
In the morning push around the enemy if you can and get onto his right rear.

185
00:19:23.04 --> 00:19:28.64
The movements of the enemy's cavalry may of course modify your action.

186
00:19:28.64 --> 00:19:34.48
We will act together as one army here until it is seen what can be done with the enemy.

187
00:19:34.48 --> 00:19:40.32
So he's making some adjustments to what his original plan were. Still giving some, you know,

188
00:19:40.32 --> 00:19:45.28
some statement that the enemy gets a vote and you can modify your what you're doing. You can

189
00:19:45.28 --> 00:19:53.12
modify your actions is actually what he says. And you know, part of the reason I'm going through

190
00:19:53.12 --> 00:19:57.36
some of these commands because it's it's interesting to hear what these orders were like.

191
00:19:57.36 --> 00:20:05.04
And how they came across and the importance of writing well and being able to write things

192
00:20:05.04 --> 00:20:10.80
in a simple clear concise manner that everybody understands. So important. It's also important to

193
00:20:10.80 --> 00:20:22.96
realize that no matter how clearly you think you articulate something, the chances of that

194
00:20:22.96 --> 00:20:28.08
person having it and understanding it, it's exactly the manner that you wish to convey it

195
00:20:29.36 --> 00:20:37.12
are not strong, which is again another proactive reason to maintain flexibility in what you're

196
00:20:37.12 --> 00:20:43.68
telling people to do. And if you give them what the objective is, look, it's a lot easier for me

197
00:20:43.68 --> 00:20:48.80
to tell you hey Jason, we're trying to get to this hill over here. That's it's pretty hard.

198
00:20:48.80 --> 00:20:55.44
I want you to seize this hilltop. It's hard for you to miss and interpret what I say. Hey,

199
00:20:55.44 --> 00:21:00.24
go seize this hilltop. You need to go take that hilltop. Okay. Well, you know what you're doing.

200
00:21:00.24 --> 00:21:04.000
Now if I start saying hey, I want you to take that hilltop and I want you to maneuver

201
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.04
this direction, plus I want you to set this up over here. Now those are a bunch of things that

202
00:21:07.04 --> 00:21:13.52
can get miss and interpret it. Yeah, or we need to lay our artillery fire down on this thing.

203
00:21:14.48 --> 00:21:18.24
Get me to a good spot to lay our artillery fire and then I can choose the hilltop that makes

204
00:21:18.24 --> 00:21:29.04
the most sense for me. Yeah. So simple, clear concise. That concise piece is a real thing.

205
00:21:29.04 --> 00:21:35.04
When you start talking too much and trying to convey too much and there's a balance, of course,

206
00:21:35.04 --> 00:21:39.92
you know, like take the hill. That might not be enough. If I say take the hill in order to provide

207
00:21:40.64 --> 00:21:44.48
artillery support to this spot. Now you can make all kinds of things happen.

208
00:21:44.48 --> 00:21:53.12
Oh, communication. Fast forward a little bit. My command was the extreme left of our lines.

209
00:21:53.12 --> 00:21:58.08
My own brigade along the difficult branch of gravel. We run facing toward airies

210
00:21:58.96 --> 00:22:03.52
with the, and that's another another leader out here with Gregory's brigade, which had

211
00:22:03.52 --> 00:22:08.80
reported to me for this campaign refused, which is a term that meant bent back at right angles.

212
00:22:08.80 --> 00:22:14.72
So as to face, Westerly, along a country road leading from Boydon to Claireborn Road.

213
00:22:16.80 --> 00:22:21.76
And this is where we can start to get into a little bit. It may seem strange that in such a state

214
00:22:21.76 --> 00:22:27.68
of things, Warren should have been made, should have made the suggestion for a movement to his front.

215
00:22:27.68 --> 00:22:34.96
But he was anxious as we're all his subordinates to strike a blow in the line of our main business,

216
00:22:34.96 --> 00:22:44.40
which was to turn Lee's right and break up his army. Wet and worn and famished as we all were,

217
00:22:44.40 --> 00:22:48.88
we were alive to the thought that prompt, that promptness and vigor of action.

218
00:22:50.08 --> 00:22:56.64
What we like to call violence of action would at all events determine the conditions and chances of the

219
00:22:56.64 --> 00:23:03.36
campaign. And if this movement did not involve the immediate turning of Lee's right in his

220
00:23:03.36 --> 00:23:08.24
entrenchments, it would secure the white oak road to the west of them, which Grant had a

221
00:23:08.24 --> 00:23:14.32
shirt shared in was of much importance. And would enable us to hold Lee's right in check so that

222
00:23:14.32 --> 00:23:22.24
Sheridan could either advance on white oak road towards us and Burgess Mill as Grant asked him to do

223
00:23:22.24 --> 00:23:26.80
or make a dash on the south side railroad and cut their communications and turn to right

224
00:23:26.80 --> 00:23:32.32
by a wider sweep as Grant had also suggested him do. Late in the afternoon, Warren received

225
00:23:32.32 --> 00:23:39.92
through general web chief of staff the following order. General, mead, general, mead directs

226
00:23:40.64 --> 00:23:45.68
that should you determine by your reconnaissance that you can gain possession of and hold

227
00:23:45.68 --> 00:23:50.56
white oak road, you are to do so notwithstanding the order to suspend operations today.

228
00:23:52.96 --> 00:23:58.24
So he's getting told, okay, if you go do a reconnaissance, this is what Warren's getting told.

229
00:23:58.24 --> 00:24:05.68
Go do a reconnaissance. If you think that through your reconnaissance, you can take white oak road

230
00:24:05.68 --> 00:24:10.72
and you can hold it. Then do it. Unless we tell you not to do anything today.

231
00:24:11.92 --> 00:24:19.20
Okay. And so this just turns into the biggest, I had a hard time like he's trying to explain to

232
00:24:19.20 --> 00:24:24.56
us how much confusion was going on there. Yeah, I was like, oh my gosh. Yeah, and that's

233
00:24:24.56 --> 00:24:30.48
trying to track the confusion and I'm getting confused. Yeah, like I guess I didn't even need to say like,

234
00:24:30.48 --> 00:24:35.04
hey, this is going to be confusing and it's harder to track. Even if you go watch the video on YouTube

235
00:24:35.04 --> 00:24:39.84
with the animated pieces from 40,000 feet, you're still going to have a little, I'm going to

236
00:24:39.84 --> 00:24:45.52
want, I'm going to watch that again. Wait, who is this over here? But so he gets told, hey,

237
00:24:45.52 --> 00:24:52.80
if you think you can take it, take it and this is what Chamberlain writes, this gave a sudden turn to

238
00:24:52.80 --> 00:25:01.36
dreams. In that humiliation, fasting and prayer, visions arose like prophecy evolved. We felt the

239
00:25:01.36 --> 00:25:07.12
swing and sweep. We saw the enemy turn front and flank across the white oak road, shared and

240
00:25:07.12 --> 00:25:13.28
flashing on our wheeling flank, cutting communications, and flating the Claireborn entrenchments,

241
00:25:13.28 --> 00:25:17.84
our second core over the main works followed up by our troops in the old line,

242
00:25:17.84 --> 00:25:23.20
seizing the supreme moment to smash in the Petersburg defenses, scattering capture all that was

243
00:25:23.20 --> 00:25:29.28
left of Lee's army and sweep away every menace to the old flag between us and the James River.

244
00:25:30.40 --> 00:25:37.68
Mirage and glamour of boyish fancy measuring things by its heart, day dreams of men familiar with

245
00:25:37.68 --> 00:25:46.000
this aster, drenched in famous, but building as ever, castles of their souls above the level

246
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:59.44
river of death. What a way to say, hey, bro, don't get your hopes up too high. This is when you're,

247
00:25:59.44 --> 00:26:04.80
what is it? You're emotions outweigh your capability. What's that? That's her. The capability.

248
00:26:04.80 --> 00:26:10.48
Don't let your enthusiasm outrun your capability. That's what he's talking about here. Hey,

249
00:26:10.48 --> 00:26:18.48
if we, if we go, man, we can take white oak road, we can freaking cut the lines. We're going to do it.

250
00:26:18.48 --> 00:26:23.28
All we're going to win it all. Day dreams of men familiar. This was scary. Men familiar with

251
00:26:23.28 --> 00:26:30.08
this aster. These are hardened combat veterans and they're drenched in famished, but they build

252
00:26:30.08 --> 00:26:40.32
castles of their souls above the level river of death. Such a good warning to us. Don't

253
00:26:40.32 --> 00:26:48.56
let your enthusiasm outweigh your capability. It was mingled with feelings of mortification,

254
00:26:48.56 --> 00:26:55.20
apprehension and desperation that in the very ecstasy of these visions, word came to us of Sheridan's

255
00:26:55.20 --> 00:27:01.36
latest dispatch to grant the evening before that pickets division of infantry was deployed along

256
00:27:01.36 --> 00:27:08.08
the white oak road, his right reaching to five forks, and the whole rebel cavalry was

257
00:27:08.08 --> 00:27:15.20
massing at that place, so Sheridan would be held in check by them instead of dashing up as was his

258
00:27:15.20 --> 00:27:23.52
want to give a cyclone edge to our weeling flank. Grant's dispatch to me transmitting this was a

259
00:27:23.52 --> 00:27:30.56
dire disenchantment, the Nell rang thus. From this dispatch, Warren will not have the cavalry

260
00:27:30.56 --> 00:27:41.60
support on his left flank that I expected he must watch closely his left flank. So now we're

261
00:27:41.60 --> 00:27:47.68
getting told we're all excited and now we're being told. No, you're not going to have any support.

262
00:27:48.56 --> 00:27:53.44
And this is this is the ups and downs of war, right? The highs and lows of combat. It's go,

263
00:27:53.44 --> 00:28:01.76
it's not a go. It's a go, it's not a go. Although Grant had given outward that there should be no

264
00:28:01.76 --> 00:28:10.24
movement of troops that day, Lee seems not so to have Lee seems not so to have resolved.

265
00:28:12.56 --> 00:28:16.40
So the enemy gets a vote, hey, we don't think there's going to be any movement this day.

266
00:28:16.40 --> 00:28:22.08
Lead in the degree with that. Lead it. We wasn't part of that plan. Driven to seize every advantage

267
00:28:22.08 --> 00:28:28.56
or desperate expedition, he ordered four brigades to move out from their entrenchments, get across

268
00:28:28.56 --> 00:28:33.52
the flank of the fifth court and smash it in. We did not know this, but it was the very situation

269
00:28:33.52 --> 00:28:38.80
which Grant had made for the occasion for attacking ourselves. It was a strange coincidence,

270
00:28:38.80 --> 00:28:44.56
but it was to both parties a surprise. The enemy gets a vote. That's what's happening.

271
00:28:44.56 --> 00:28:52.40
This was the condition of things and of minds when the advance ordered for the white oak road was

272
00:28:52.40 --> 00:29:00.56
put into execution. Eres advanced, soldier-like, as was his nature, resolute, thumb-hearted,

273
00:29:00.56 --> 00:29:10.32
fearing nothing and truth not fearing quite enough. Although he believed his advance would bring on a

274
00:29:10.32 --> 00:29:16.40
battle he moved without skirmishes, skirmishers, but in a wedge-like formation guarding both flanks.

275
00:29:17.28 --> 00:29:22.16
The enemy onset was swift and the encounter sudden, the blow fell without warning,

276
00:29:22.16 --> 00:29:32.08
enveloping Aries complete front. General Hunting says they were not expecting to strike our troops

277
00:29:32.08 --> 00:29:37.44
so soon and that the attack was not made by usual orders, but that on discovering our advance

278
00:29:37.44 --> 00:29:43.36
so close upon them, a gallient lieutenant in his brigade sprung forth in the front of his line,

279
00:29:43.36 --> 00:29:50.48
waving his sword with the shout, follow me boys, whereupon all three brigades on their right

280
00:29:50.48 --> 00:29:56.24
dashed forward into the charge. There's a little decentralized command.

281
00:29:57.20 --> 00:30:05.60
Well that's the reverse of what happened on the roundtop, right? They do a bayonet charge. They

282
00:30:05.60 --> 00:30:11.28
destroy numerically superior force because they took him by surprise and here

283
00:30:12.24 --> 00:30:16.96
this is the confederates doing it to them. And actually, they're like, oh well they didn't do it by

284
00:30:16.96 --> 00:30:22.08
the little pit, they got in that echelon and so there's a little bit of complacency there

285
00:30:22.80 --> 00:30:26.80
which will always get you. Yeah that'll always get you. Luckily you got some

286
00:30:27.68 --> 00:30:33.36
young lieutenant that sees what's happening and says you know what, I'm going to make something happen.

287
00:30:33.36 --> 00:30:38.56
We're going on the counter, follow me boys. Went for up was overwhelmed in his superior

288
00:30:38.56 --> 00:30:43.52
and his support to demoralized. All he could hope for was to retire in Gordon order,

289
00:30:43.52 --> 00:30:47.36
meaning retreat. That's what he's hoping you'll be able to get out of there. This he exerted

290
00:30:47.36 --> 00:30:53.68
himself to effect, but this is not an easy thing to do when once the retreat is started before

291
00:30:53.68 --> 00:31:03.92
a spirited foe superior numbers or in the flush and rush of success. So they confederate guy that

292
00:31:03.92 --> 00:31:10.32
did the decentralized command and just charge them, right? Yes. And that just broke them.

293
00:31:10.32 --> 00:31:17.04
The, the, and now we've got the union saying, oh we got a retreat like we're screwed.

294
00:31:17.04 --> 00:31:27.12
Um, which is bad. And then he talks about worse. Yeah, well it's worse. And he said he's this,

295
00:31:27.12 --> 00:31:32.64
this wind drop, all he can hope for is that they can get out of there like not losing control.

296
00:31:32.64 --> 00:31:39.12
And he says he tries to make that happen. But it's not an easy thing when the retreat is started

297
00:31:39.12 --> 00:31:44.16
before a spirited foe superior number. So there's more confederates, they're fired up,

298
00:31:44.16 --> 00:31:51.12
they're flush from having being like they got momentum going on and in vain the gallant

299
00:31:51.12 --> 00:31:57.36
Dennis and strove to stem the torrent, a disabling wound struck down his brave example. And the

300
00:31:57.36 --> 00:32:04.72
effect of this shows how much moral forces have to do in sustaining the physical. So you've got

301
00:32:04.72 --> 00:32:10.32
a gallant individual that's trying to get to stop people from just running away. Because if you just

302
00:32:10.32 --> 00:32:14.64
run away, you're going to take massive casualties. Look, if you retreat, you're going to take casualties.

303
00:32:14.64 --> 00:32:20.16
But to put it in very simple terms, if you don't cover and move as you retreat, you're going

304
00:32:20.16 --> 00:32:26.24
to get slaughtered. So you've got to say, okay, you know, platoon over here, you guys laid that down

305
00:32:26.24 --> 00:32:30.80
fire, we'll go back 50 yards, then we'll lay down fire for you. You have to do that. If you just

306
00:32:30.80 --> 00:32:35.92
all get up and turn tail, you're just going to get shot in the back. And you're going to get slaughtered.

307
00:32:35.92 --> 00:32:42.80
So the leadership is trying to make that happen, trying to make it an orderly retreat.

308
00:32:43.68 --> 00:32:50.88
And this disinvisual is stepping up, trying to like, okay, hey, platoon hold and all of a sudden

309
00:32:50.88 --> 00:32:59.36
he gets shot. And then he says that the this effect shows the moral, how much more the moral forces

310
00:32:59.36 --> 00:33:06.08
have to do and then sustaining the physical. So when that happens, it just falls apart, brigade

311
00:33:06.08 --> 00:33:12.08
after brigade broke. And that instant brigade after brigade broke. That strange impulse turned

312
00:33:12.08 --> 00:33:25.76
a panic took effect. And the retreat became a route. Aries like a roaring lion in devours to check

313
00:33:25.76 --> 00:33:33.12
the disorder and make a stand on each favoring crest and wooded ravine button vane. His men stream

314
00:33:33.12 --> 00:33:39.52
past him. Oh, so he's every time he gets a little terrain feature, Aries steps up and hey,

315
00:33:39.52 --> 00:33:46.64
hold up. Hey, let's get some cover fire. They just run by him. They come back on Crawford's

316
00:33:46.64 --> 00:33:52.56
veteran division and burst through it in spite of all the indignant Kellogg can do involving this

317
00:33:52.56 --> 00:33:57.92
also in the demoralization and the whole crowd comes back reckless of everything but to get

318
00:33:57.92 --> 00:34:04.000
behind the lines on Boitner Road, plunging through the swampy run, breaking through Griffin's right

319
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.64
where he and Barlett reformed behind the third brigade. So finally, they rum back behind friendly lines.

320
00:34:12.64 --> 00:34:19.44
The enemy pursuing swarmed down the bank opposite us and are met by sharp fire of muscatry

321
00:34:19.44 --> 00:34:25.28
and artillery which we had made ready on hearing the noise of the retreat. So once the people that

322
00:34:25.28 --> 00:34:32.24
are retreating get behind friendly lines, union lines, now the the enemy's common after them

323
00:34:32.96 --> 00:34:38.88
and they engage. We were expecting them to fall in force on our left and Gregory's front.

324
00:34:38.88 --> 00:34:43.28
When I was riding along that line anxious about this, when General Warren and General Griffin

325
00:34:43.28 --> 00:34:48.16
came down at full speed, both out of breath, breath with their efforts to rally the panic

326
00:34:48.16 --> 00:34:53.84
stricken man whose honor was their own and evidently under great stress of feeling. So now you

327
00:34:53.84 --> 00:34:58.40
got General Warren and General Griffin come down on their horse to their out of breath and

328
00:34:58.40 --> 00:35:04.08
they're trying to rally the guys because it's their guys. He says whose honor was their own.

329
00:35:04.08 --> 00:35:11.52
It's their guys that are retreating. Griffin breaks fourth first and after his high proof

330
00:35:11.52 --> 00:35:20.32
fashion General Chamberlain the fifth core is eternally damned. I have said some pleasant trees,

331
00:35:20.32 --> 00:35:28.56
not until you are in heaven. Griffin does not smile nor hear but keeps right on. I tell Warren

332
00:35:28.56 --> 00:35:36.40
you will wipe out this disgrace and that's what we're here for. Hey it's all on you bro it's all on

333
00:35:36.40 --> 00:35:45.92
you Chamberlain we're we're we're damned. Then Warren breaks out with stirring phrase but

334
00:35:45.92 --> 00:35:51.60
uttered as if in delirium of fever General Chamberlain will you save the honor of the fifth core.

335
00:35:51.60 --> 00:35:58.32
That's all there is about it. That appealed demanded a shivalrous response. Honour is a mighty

336
00:35:58.32 --> 00:36:05.12
sentiment and the fifth core was dear to me but my answer was not up to keynote. I confess that. I was

337
00:36:05.12 --> 00:36:11.04
expecting every moment and attack on my left flank now that the enemy had disclosed our situation

338
00:36:11.04 --> 00:36:16.24
and my little brigade had taken the brunt of things thus far but the day before the last winning

339
00:36:16.24 --> 00:36:21.76
a hard fought field from which they had come off grievously thinned and torn and worn and

340
00:36:21.76 --> 00:36:29.76
once I had hardly but fought myself that day. I had hardly brought myself away so he barely made

341
00:36:29.76 --> 00:36:33.36
it off the last battlefield and we already talked about his casualties. He didn't talk much about

342
00:36:33.36 --> 00:36:40.08
the previous battle but they had already taken a couple hundred or almost a couple hundred casualties

343
00:36:40.08 --> 00:36:46.96
and he barely made it off. I mentioned Bartlett who had our largest and best brigade which had

344
00:36:46.96 --> 00:36:52.08
been but little engaged. We have come to you you know that you know what that means.

345
00:36:53.52 --> 00:36:57.52
I'll try it General only don't let anybody stop me except the enemy.

346
00:36:57.52 --> 00:37:05.68
Right on. Yeah so they've been put in check a bunch of times you know hey hold what you got

347
00:37:05.68 --> 00:37:09.60
not just in this battle but there's some specific moments when that happens where they're

348
00:37:09.60 --> 00:37:15.84
getting held back held back held back and he says you know I'll try but don't let anybody stop

349
00:37:15.84 --> 00:37:21.84
me but the enemy. I had reason for that protest as things had been going on.

350
00:37:21.84 --> 00:37:29.20
They say back to I will have a bridge ready here in less than an hour. You can't get men through

351
00:37:29.20 --> 00:37:36.000
this swamp in any kind of order says Warren it may do to come back on General it will not stop.

352
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.88
It will not do to stop for that now. My men will go straight through so they want to bring

353
00:37:40.88 --> 00:37:45.12
like one of those pontoon bridges down. Chamberlain hey in an hour we'll have you pontoon bridge.

354
00:37:45.12 --> 00:37:49.76
Otherwise you can not get me to do it. That'll do to come back. We'll come back on that bridge when

355
00:37:49.76 --> 00:37:57.36
we're done. So at a word the first baton of the hundred ninety-eightth Pennsylvania major

356
00:37:57.36 --> 00:38:02.08
Glenn commanding plunges into the muddy branch waste deep and more with cartridge boxes born

357
00:38:02.08 --> 00:38:07.44
upon the bayonet sockets above the turbid waters. The second baton keeping the banks beyond

358
00:38:07.84 --> 00:38:12.16
clear of the enemy by their well-directed fire. We got cover move going on by the way.

359
00:38:13.28 --> 00:38:18.16
Until the first has formed in the skirmish order and pressed up the bank I followed with the

360
00:38:18.16 --> 00:38:22.56
rest of the brigade in the line of battle and Gregories in column of regiments.

361
00:38:23.60 --> 00:38:28.80
The enemy fell back without much resistance until finding supports on broken strong ground.

362
00:38:28.80 --> 00:38:35.44
They made stand after stand. Griffin followed with Bartlett Bartlett's brigade in reserve.

363
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.88
In due time areas troops got across and followed up on our left rear walk Crawford

364
00:38:40.88 --> 00:38:46.56
with somewhere to our right and rear but out of sight or reach after we had once cleared the

365
00:38:46.56 --> 00:38:54.48
bank of the stream. After sharp fighting here we drove them across an extensive field to some

366
00:38:54.48 --> 00:39:02.000
works they seem to have already prepared of the usual sort in field operations, logs and earth

367
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.88
from which they delivered a severe fire which caused the right of my line to waver,

368
00:39:06.88 --> 00:39:11.76
taking advantage of the slight shelter of a crest in the open field I was preparing for a final

369
00:39:11.76 --> 00:39:17.04
charge when I received an order to hold my command and defend my position as best I could.

370
00:39:17.92 --> 00:39:22.56
I did not like that much. It was a hard place to stay in. The officer who brought me the order

371
00:39:22.56 --> 00:39:28.16
had his horse shot under him as he delivered it. So here you are, you're ready to make a

372
00:39:28.16 --> 00:39:32.16
charge and all of a sudden they say, hey hold you got. And by the way the person that told you to

373
00:39:32.16 --> 00:39:36.96
stay there just had his horse shot out from under him. I rode back to see what the order meant.

374
00:39:36.96 --> 00:39:40.56
I found General Griffin in general warned in the edge of the woods overlooking the field and

375
00:39:40.56 --> 00:39:46.000
reported my plans. We had already more than recovered the ground taken and lost by the second and

376
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.60
third divisions. The fifth corps had been rapidly and completely vindicated and the question was now

377
00:39:51.60 --> 00:39:55.12
of taking white oak road. So they've gotten back all the ground. The fifth corps,

378
00:39:55.12 --> 00:40:03.12
yay we delivered. You wanted me to rectify the honor lost by the brigade. By the course,

379
00:40:03.12 --> 00:40:12.80
sorry, we did it. And he says, I proposed a Gregory to put Gregory's brigade into those woods

380
00:40:12.80 --> 00:40:17.92
by battalion in National on by the left by which formation he could take in flanking reserve and

381
00:40:17.92 --> 00:40:23.68
succession. My any attacks on my right when Gregory should be well advanced. I would charge the

382
00:40:23.68 --> 00:40:29.52
works across the field with my own brigade. My plan being approved. I instructed Gregory to keep

383
00:40:29.52 --> 00:40:34.48
in the woods. So, it's another great example of pushback. They tell him, hold, he goes way to second.

384
00:40:34.48 --> 00:40:38.72
They're not seeing something. And I'm seeing goes back and talks to his leadership and says,

385
00:40:38.72 --> 00:40:49.52
I got a better idea. How about this? Yeah. And they say, get some. And the moment he struck any

386
00:40:49.52 --> 00:40:54.40
opposition to Opo. This is another part of the plan was at the moment. This was for Gregory.

387
00:40:54.40 --> 00:40:58.88
The moment he struck any opposition to open at once with full valleys and make all the

388
00:40:58.88 --> 00:41:03.92
demonstration he could. And I would seize that moment to make a dash at the works in my front.

389
00:41:05.68 --> 00:41:10.48
Had I known to the fact that generally himself was personally directing affairs in our front,

390
00:41:10.48 --> 00:41:13.92
I might not have been so rash or thought myself so cool. So he comes up with this plan and

391
00:41:13.92 --> 00:41:23.52
later he finds out, I was generally he was going up against down. And now it gets down to business.

392
00:41:23.52 --> 00:41:30.64
He says, what we had to do could not be done by firing. This was foot and hand business. We went

393
00:41:30.64 --> 00:41:37.20
with a rush, not minding ranks or alignments, but with open front to lessen loss from long range

394
00:41:37.20 --> 00:41:43.92
rifles. Within effective range, about 300 yards, the sharp cutting fire made us real and shiver.

395
00:41:44.80 --> 00:41:53.12
Now, quick or never, on and over. The impetuous 180 fifth New York rolls over the enemy's

396
00:41:53.12 --> 00:42:00.16
right and seems to swallow it up. The 198th Pennsylvania with its 14 companies, half veterans,

397
00:42:00.16 --> 00:42:07.20
half soldiers born so swing in from their left striking huntins brigade in the front. And for a

398
00:42:07.20 --> 00:42:13.28
few minutes, there is a seething wave of counter-currents, then rolling back leaving a fringe of

399
00:42:13.28 --> 00:42:20.32
wrecks and all is over. We pour over the works on across the white oak road, swing to the right

400
00:42:20.32 --> 00:42:26.48
and drive the enemy into their entrenchments along the Claireborn road, and then establish ourselves

401
00:42:26.48 --> 00:42:36.64
across the road facing northeast and take a breath. There's a footnote in here. General Hunton,

402
00:42:37.60 --> 00:42:42.80
since Senator from Virginia, said in his testimony before the war in court, speaking of this

403
00:42:42.80 --> 00:42:50.56
charge, the charge that he led, the charge that chambered in lead, I thought it was one of the most

404
00:42:50.56 --> 00:42:58.96
of gallant things I had ever seen. Major Woodward in his history, the 198th Pennsylvania,

405
00:42:58.96 --> 00:43:04.16
giving a graphic outline of the last dash closes with an incident I had not reported recorded.

406
00:43:05.04 --> 00:43:10.88
Only for a moment he says did the sudden and terrible blast of death cause the right of the line to

407
00:43:10.88 --> 00:43:18.16
waver. On they dashed every color flying, officers leading right in and among the enemy,

408
00:43:18.16 --> 00:43:24.32
leaping the breastworks, a confused struggle of firing, cutting, thrusting, a tremendous surge of

409
00:43:24.32 --> 00:43:30.64
force, both moral and physical on the enemy's breaking lines and the works were carried.

410
00:43:32.40 --> 00:43:39.04
Private Augustus Zeber captured the flag of the 46th Virginia in mounting one of the

411
00:43:39.04 --> 00:43:44.88
parapids and handed it to General Chamberlain in the midst of the melee who immediately gave it back

412
00:43:44.88 --> 00:43:51.28
to him, telling him to keep it and take the credit that belonged to him. Almost that entire

413
00:43:51.28 --> 00:43:59.28
regiment was captured at the same time. It was scarcely needed be added that the man who captured

414
00:43:59.28 --> 00:44:05.60
that battle flag was sent with it in person to General Warren and that he received a metal of honor

415
00:44:05.60 --> 00:44:14.64
from the government. So again the representation of these flags is, it means that and the fact that

416
00:44:18.48 --> 00:44:24.48
Zeber Caps Zeber Zeber Zeber Zeber? Yeah Augustus Augustus,

417
00:44:25.76 --> 00:44:30.32
Zeber captures the flag and then he's like, hey man, you got it, you keep it.

418
00:44:30.32 --> 00:44:37.76
Nobody misses that. Nobody. They're like, oh, that's the guy that's letting the team have the credit

419
00:44:38.80 --> 00:44:44.24
and that's the kind of leader that you're going to die for that you're going to be afraid

420
00:44:44.24 --> 00:44:49.60
of disappointing because he's pushing it and there's just an example of what after example of

421
00:44:49.60 --> 00:44:59.12
him doing that kind of thing. Yeah that's literally what you said it's the the the flag,

422
00:44:59.12 --> 00:45:04.32
the symbol of the enemy is this thing, this flag and that's all the credit. That is the credit.

423
00:45:05.36 --> 00:45:11.60
And the young soldier gives him the credit and he says, no, you get the credit.

424
00:45:17.68 --> 00:45:22.64
In due time Gregory came out of the woods, his face beaming with satisfaction at the result

425
00:45:22.64 --> 00:45:26.96
which his solid work so faithfully performed had been essential. By the way this is just a giant

426
00:45:26.96 --> 00:45:32.56
cover move. Gregory's over in the wood line laying down fire as soon as they got to a point where

427
00:45:32.56 --> 00:45:38.000
they had good angle, he they let loose the fire and that was chambering signal to go and they went.

428
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:48.000
That's why there's no other tactic that's it. His brigade was placed in line along the white

429
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.40
oak road on our right and a picket thrown out close up to the enemy's works. This movement had

430
00:45:52.40 --> 00:45:58.32
taken three hours and was almost a continuous fight with several crescendo passages and a final

431
00:45:58.32 --> 00:46:03.52
cadence of wild chromatic sweep settling in the steady keynote thrilling with the chords of

432
00:46:03.52 --> 00:46:10.56
its unwritten overtones and undertones. It had cost us a hundred men but this was all too great

433
00:46:10.56 --> 00:46:18.48
of men like these and for oblivion. It was to cost us something more a sense of fruitlessness and

434
00:46:18.48 --> 00:46:30.96
thanklessness. Fast forward in a little bit. Grant had experienced a sudden change of mine.

435
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.20
Mind a complete and decided one. His imperative order now received meant giving up entirely the

436
00:46:39.20 --> 00:46:49.44
position we had just been ordered to entrench across the hard one white oak road.

437
00:46:49.44 --> 00:46:55.60
That I mean after this it just turns into a huge mess which would take like three hours just to

438
00:46:55.60 --> 00:47:04.64
try to entangle. I guess the biggest example of it is just really poor communication,

439
00:47:04.64 --> 00:47:10.08
information coming in at weird times. Yeah we'll jump into that's worth jumping and that's

440
00:47:10.08 --> 00:47:16.32
one of the reasons I felt like I had to sort of try and explain some of the maneuver, the scheme

441
00:47:16.32 --> 00:47:22.64
of maneuver so that we could when we get to the kind of breakdown of all these orders that were

442
00:47:22.64 --> 00:47:30.000
coming in when they came in. This is another one of those orders which is hey give up what you just

443
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.48
fought for that's the fruitfulness that he just talked about. This is why. And it goes then it says

444
00:47:34.48 --> 00:47:39.68
Warren anxious to fulfill the spirit and object of the order rather than render a mechanical obedience

445
00:47:39.68 --> 00:47:47.44
the letter of it since his nearest division under areas the strong stern old soldier of the Mexican

446
00:47:47.44 --> 00:47:57.52
work to start once at once for Sheridan. This was the situation when half past 10 in the evening

447
00:47:57.52 --> 00:48:03.84
came in order throwing everything into a complete model. It was for me to Warren send Griffin

448
00:48:03.84 --> 00:48:09.68
promptly as ordered by the Bointon plank road but move the balance of your command by the road

449
00:48:09.68 --> 00:48:15.20
Bartlett is on and strike the enemy in the rear who is between him and Denwitty. So now you can see

450
00:48:15.20 --> 00:48:20.000
now the orders are becoming very very specific. Actually telling this person to go to this place and

451
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.16
do this thing. Instead of letting the people in the ground hey my intent is to get to the rear of the

452
00:48:26.16 --> 00:48:30.72
enemy. If you said that to me cool I got a group that's even closer a group that didn't take

453
00:48:30.72 --> 00:48:34.000
that many casualties or a group where I got a super aggressive leader and he can make it happen.

454
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.64
But when you give these very specific micromanaging directions you're going to impose things

455
00:48:40.64 --> 00:48:47.76
on that you might not have intended. Who's the person best to solve the problem? The guy back in the

456
00:48:47.76 --> 00:48:52.96
tent or the person closest to the problem. And that's what you're empowering those folks to do and

457
00:48:52.96 --> 00:48:57.52
you're like hey here's what we need to do and then you figure out because it's just a it's all these

458
00:48:57.52 --> 00:49:02.08
specific orders coming in. Yeah. It would have been guys around. Yeah and if you and if you

459
00:49:03.04 --> 00:49:09.04
see something or know something from the tent that the person in the front can't know or can't see

460
00:49:09.04 --> 00:49:14.08
then it's your job to inform them of that so that they can put that into the calculus of their decision

461
00:49:14.08 --> 00:49:21.20
making process. Pat and said the Denwitty example but the leader on the front is always wrong. The

462
00:49:21.20 --> 00:49:25.28
leader in the front is always right. The leader in the front is always right. So you support that guy.

463
00:49:25.28 --> 00:49:29.60
Jason calls back and says hey I need air sport. Cool. I'm getting your sport. You tell me

464
00:49:29.60 --> 00:49:33.28
you need another platoon? Sport cool. We're sending another platoon. I'm not saying what do you do

465
00:49:33.28 --> 00:49:38.40
that? If I if you say hey I'm going to maneuver to the north instead of the south okay let me

466
00:49:38.40 --> 00:49:43.12
make sure you have the support you need. Not what? Actually think it would be better to. Unless I see

467
00:49:43.12 --> 00:49:48.08
hey Jason there's a massive enemy force coming in from the west. You need to see her clear there. Oh thank

468
00:49:48.08 --> 00:50:00.40
you for telling me. Another by this order the core was to be turned and for end and inside out.

469
00:50:00.40 --> 00:50:07.28
Four of Warren might be forgiven if at such an order his head slam and his wits collapsed.

470
00:50:07.28 --> 00:50:12.48
He responds thus and has been much blamed for by those under his canvas. Then since

471
00:50:12.48 --> 00:50:20.16
I issued my orders on general webs first dispatch to call back which made the divisions retire

472
00:50:20.16 --> 00:50:24.88
in order of Aries Crawford and Griffin which was the order they could most rapidly move in.

473
00:50:24.88 --> 00:50:30.40
I cannot change them tonight without producing confusion that will render all my operations

474
00:50:30.40 --> 00:50:36.40
new gatorie. I will now send general Aries to general Sheraton and take general Griffin

475
00:50:36.40 --> 00:50:42.000
a general Crawford to move against the enemy at this last dispatch directs I should. I cannot

476
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.68
accomplish the object of the orders I have received. He says look dude I've already got people in a

477
00:50:47.68 --> 00:50:52.32
certain order out here if I start trying to rearrange them in the middle of the night are you kidding me?

478
00:50:52.32 --> 00:51:00.16
No. But what inconceivable addition to the confusion came in the following dispatch from general

479
00:51:00.16 --> 00:51:05.92
me to Warren at one o'clock at night would not time be gained by sending troops by the Quaker Road.

480
00:51:05.92 --> 00:51:15.28
Again this is my bad micro management happening. One of the very first

481
00:51:17.52 --> 00:51:22.72
academy briefs that I did on the academy was about I called it the whip.

482
00:51:23.84 --> 00:51:30.72
And yeah I talked about we were but we were on the orgs we were on a ship and we're supposed to be

483
00:51:30.72 --> 00:51:36.72
doing some training mission and we get told hey you're going to take your zodiac boats and

484
00:51:36.72 --> 00:51:42.32
load them on a helicopter and go do this mission. Okay cool. So what does that mean?

485
00:51:42.96 --> 00:51:50.56
It means about four or five hours of preparation zodiacs we got to get the the Mogas fuel

486
00:51:50.56 --> 00:51:57.28
to the right part of the ship. We got to get the equipment prepped and loaded into the zodiacs

487
00:51:57.28 --> 00:52:02.56
then we got to get the zodiacs moved to up to the helodeck and then we got to tie them all up with all that

488
00:52:02.56 --> 00:52:10.40
freaking 10,000 feet of half inch and one inch tube your nylon put the honeycomb card board into

489
00:52:10.40 --> 00:52:15.76
the bottom and put packed the freaking engine into it and there's this massive amount of work.

490
00:52:16.40 --> 00:52:21.92
We're doing it and then we get word hey actually you're not going by helode you're going by

491
00:52:21.92 --> 00:52:29.12
rib boat, rigid home, flatable boat. Okay so we start breaking all that stuff down. It takes us another

492
00:52:29.12 --> 00:52:34.40
five hours to break it down and get these zodiacs ready to launch with the ribs.

493
00:52:35.60 --> 00:52:40.56
Just as we complete that task what comes back actually is looks like it's going to be helos.

494
00:52:40.56 --> 00:52:45.84
So this is some I've lived that same. Oh it's a nightmare and I called the whip because it's a

495
00:52:45.84 --> 00:52:49.36
little tiny movement up at the top it's just a little oh we're going to use helos okay

496
00:52:49.36 --> 00:52:54.56
he literally changes one word in a brief insert by helos insert by rib. Change one word in

497
00:52:54.56 --> 00:53:00.80
this little briefing takes him four seconds and it costs us five hours of work and then very

498
00:53:00.80 --> 00:53:07.12
quickly changes it back to ribs back to helos and so as leaders we have to understand the impact

499
00:53:07.12 --> 00:53:11.84
that the little movement you have from the top takes on the bottom. Who corrected that?

500
00:53:11.84 --> 00:53:21.28
I think we like deal art on the fourth change. Like no actually I just I think my

501
00:53:21.28 --> 00:53:25.28
pertune comment I was like hey we we don't we can't actually do that the only thing we can

502
00:53:25.28 --> 00:53:29.68
do is launch on whatever it was I think but that point was on ribs we can't we don't have time

503
00:53:29.68 --> 00:53:34.80
to get he was ready what do you mean you're off time it takes five hours to rig four boats for freaking

504
00:53:34.80 --> 00:53:45.84
oh yeah it's interesting and that's one of those things where dude I just raised your blood pressure

505
00:53:45.84 --> 00:53:52.000
it there's because I've lived like somebody comes out of this air conditioned space where they're

506
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.40
doing it and they're like I live that in Gwang like hey we're going to do a stack duck

507
00:53:58.72 --> 00:54:02.96
and we get all the way to where we get the jump master to come to a stack duck is when we have

508
00:54:02.96 --> 00:54:08.24
we're going to jump two zodiacs via parachute and the rest of us are going to parachute and

509
00:54:08.24 --> 00:54:12.56
then it turns into the limp duck where now it's not going to get parachute you did but it's just

510
00:54:12.56 --> 00:54:16.56
going to get pushed out the back out of the locker. It's got to get re-rigged completely and everything

511
00:54:16.56 --> 00:54:22.80
changes and you're just getting flailed around and and that's when mistakes happen and that's

512
00:54:22.80 --> 00:54:30.08
one it's good that like hopefully there's somebody in there in in the decision making process it's like

513
00:54:30.08 --> 00:54:35.20
hey you're jerking everybody around right now that's detached because the guys that are

514
00:54:35.20 --> 00:54:40.40
they're making these calls they don't realize it they're just coming up with a bunch of good ideas

515
00:54:41.84 --> 00:54:46.48
and they've forgotten what's happening at the end of that whip that they're rate waving around

516
00:54:49.84 --> 00:54:56.96
continues on here rapidly changing plans and movements in affecting the single purpose for battle

517
00:54:56.96 --> 00:55:05.52
for which battle is delivered or what a soldier must expect the end the ability to form them wisely

518
00:55:05.52 --> 00:55:12.24
and promptly illustrates and test military capacity but the condition in this case rendered the

519
00:55:12.24 --> 00:55:20.48
execution of these peculiarly perplexing orders had to pass through many hands and in the difficulty

520
00:55:20.48 --> 00:55:25.44
of delivering owing to distance and the nature of the ground the situation was called which

521
00:55:25.44 --> 00:55:33.68
called for them had often entirely changed hence some discretion as to the details in executing

522
00:55:33.68 --> 00:55:39.60
a definite purpose must be accorded to subordinate commanders decentralized command thank you

523
00:55:40.72 --> 00:55:45.92
the details in executing a definite purpose the purpose needs to be definite this is what we're doing

524
00:55:45.92 --> 00:55:49.28
the details of execution let the subordinate commanders do it

525
00:55:49.28 --> 00:55:59.60
look for a moment at the summary of the orders worn receive that evening even after we hit

526
00:55:59.60 --> 00:56:05.84
reached white oak road affecting his command in detail one to send a brigade to manage the

527
00:56:05.84 --> 00:56:12.24
enemies rear before shared but he had already but he had already a divid of his own accord set

528
00:56:12.24 --> 00:56:16.80
Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division the nearest troops by the nearest way you already had

529
00:56:16.80 --> 00:56:23.28
the problem handle to send this brigade by the point in road instead of the crump this was a very

530
00:56:23.28 --> 00:56:28.40
different direction and a very different tactical effect but impossible to recall Bartlett warnant sent

531
00:56:28.40 --> 00:56:35.92
Pearson already on boyton road with a detachment of Bartlett's brigade three send Griffin's division

532
00:56:35.92 --> 00:56:40.72
by point in road to shared and then draw back the whole court of that road Griffin's division

533
00:56:40.72 --> 00:56:45.60
being widely and far scattered and impossible to be collected for hours warnant sends

534
00:56:45.60 --> 00:56:54.16
airies division nearest and most disengaged four to send airies and Crawford by the way of Bartlett

535
00:56:54.16 --> 00:57:00.40
had gone and insisting on Griffin's going by point in road this would cause airies and

536
00:57:00.40 --> 00:57:05.52
Bartlett to exchange places crossing each other no longer difficult and needless march

537
00:57:07.12 --> 00:57:13.68
airies having gone according to warnant orders Griffin and Crawford were to go by Bartlett's way

538
00:57:13.68 --> 00:57:19.76
but Griffin had sent for Bartlett with draw from his position and joined the division

539
00:57:19.76 --> 00:57:25.12
ready to mass on point road so this is just you can see why this is just mayhem it's total mayhem

540
00:57:25.12 --> 00:57:30.88
and it's mayhem from micro management is what it is mayhem from micro management it is difficult

541
00:57:30.88 --> 00:57:36.96
to keep keep a clear head and trying to see this into this model now we can imagine the state

542
00:57:36.96 --> 00:57:43.20
of warnant's mind but this was not all within the space of two hours warn received orders

543
00:57:43.20 --> 00:57:47.84
involving important movements for his entire core in four different directions these came in

544
00:57:47.84 --> 00:57:54.56
rapid succession and in the following order one to retrench where he was on the wider

545
00:57:54.56 --> 00:57:59.28
white oak road and be ready to fight in the morning this was from grant to fall back with the whole

546
00:57:59.28 --> 00:58:05.44
core from the white oak road to boiten and send a division by this road to relieve Sheridan this was

547
00:58:05.44 --> 00:58:12.64
also from grant number three Griffin to be pushed down point in road but the rest of the core

548
00:58:12.64 --> 00:58:19.28
airies and Crawford to go across the fields to the crump road but the way Bartlett had gone

549
00:58:19.28 --> 00:58:25.52
and attack the enemy in the rear who's opposing Sheridan this was from meet this required a

550
00:58:25.52 --> 00:58:30.88
movement in precisely opposite direction from that indicated in the preceding order which was

551
00:58:30.88 --> 00:58:37.52
now partly executed airies had already started number four needs advice to send these troops

552
00:58:37.52 --> 00:58:44.64
backed by Quaker Road 10 miles around and give up the rear attack number five to these may be

553
00:58:44.64 --> 00:58:50.80
added the actual final movement which was that airies went down the boiten road and Griffin and Crawford

554
00:58:50.80 --> 00:58:56.000
went by dirt road across the country to crump road as indicated in meet's previous orders there's

555
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.12
one more thing general grant thought it necessary in order to make sure that Sheridan would have

556
00:59:01.12 --> 00:59:06.000
complete an absolute command of his troops to send a special message asking me to make that

557
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:17.60
distinct announcement to Sheridan this is craziness the orders which came to general one that night

558
00:59:17.60 --> 00:59:24.48
were a two an amazing degree confused and conflicting this is charging no blame on any particular

559
00:59:24.48 --> 00:59:32.40
person we will call it if you please the fault of circumstances but of course the responsibility

560
00:59:32.40 --> 00:59:38.56
for the evil effects of such conditions must naturally in military usage and ethics

561
00:59:39.44 --> 00:59:46.56
rest upon the officer receiving them and when he is not allowed to use his judgment as to the

562
00:59:46.56 --> 00:59:54.24
details of his own command it makes it very hard for him sometimes indeed it is not very pleasant

563
00:59:54.24 --> 01:00:03.36
to be a subordinate officer especially if one is also at the same time a commanding officer but

564
01:00:04.16 --> 01:00:09.68
in this case I think the trouble was the result of other recognizable contributor toary

565
01:00:09.68 --> 01:00:14.56
circumstances if I might not say causes so he's got some other reasons why this stuff happened

566
01:00:15.36 --> 01:00:22.08
this is just it's his maim and he's he's in writing the most articulate and eloquent case

567
01:00:22.08 --> 01:00:28.48
for decentralized command and not micromanaging some of the reasons he says the awkwardness of

568
01:00:28.48 --> 01:00:37.68
having in the field so many superior rather than coordinate commanders bunch of people make

569
01:00:37.68 --> 01:00:41.68
bunch of chiefs no Indians and it's not really clear who's the main effort and I think they

570
01:00:41.68 --> 01:00:50.24
shifted up at one point and you call this a double objective one point being Sheridan's independent

571
01:00:50.24 --> 01:00:55.76
operations to cut the enemy's communications the other turning of leaves right and breaking up

572
01:00:55.76 --> 01:00:59.92
his army by the entry which one of those this is prioritized next which one of these is more important

573
01:00:59.92 --> 01:01:06.24
which one do you want us to do and by the way you can't just say both because both only works if the

574
01:01:06.24 --> 01:01:09.04
enemy doesn't get a vote but the enemy is going to get a vote and so it's weather and so it's your

575
01:01:09.04 --> 01:01:13.12
troops and so it's morale and so it's the supply chain like all these things are going to have an impact

576
01:01:13.68 --> 01:01:15.84
so we got to know what's the most important thing you want done

577
01:01:15.84 --> 01:01:21.76
number three these supreme commanders being as such a distance from the field of operation

578
01:01:21.76 --> 01:01:26.16
on the 31st of March that was impossible to have a complete mutual understanding when orders were

579
01:01:26.16 --> 01:01:31.20
put into effect you're not up there and you're making calls from the rear with the gear

580
01:01:34.64 --> 01:01:38.80
number four time lost and sequence confused by the difficulty of getting over the ground to

581
01:01:38.80 --> 01:01:42.80
carry orders or obey them oh into the condition of the roads or lack of them and the extreme

582
01:01:42.80 --> 01:01:53.04
darkness of the night so yeah communication problems he says at three o'clock I had got my pickets

583
01:01:53.04 --> 01:01:56.88
which were replaced by crawfers and let my men rest as quietly as possible knowing there

584
01:01:56.88 --> 01:02:03.04
would be heavy burns laid on them in the morning so all this freaking chaos is going on and by the way

585
01:02:03.04 --> 01:02:10.48
like when that whip hits the freaking infantry men that's out with his single last shoes that

586
01:02:10.48 --> 01:02:16.64
I've put made from left freaking foot God and he's lost four of his friends and he's

587
01:02:16.64 --> 01:02:29.28
hasn't eaten and he's thirsty after such a day and night as that of the 31st of March 1865

588
01:02:29.28 --> 01:02:33.68
the morning of April 1st found the men of the 5th course strangely glad they were alive

589
01:02:33.68 --> 01:02:41.36
they'd experienced a kaleidoscopic regeneration they were ready for the next new turn

590
01:02:42.88 --> 01:02:48.48
the test of ordinary probation had been passed all the effects of humiliation fasting and

591
01:02:48.48 --> 01:02:54.000
prayer believe to sink the body and exalt the spirit had been fully wrought in them

592
01:02:56.32 --> 01:03:02.24
at the weird midnight trumpet call they rose from their fields as those whom death no longer had

593
01:03:02.24 --> 01:03:08.72
any power they're pulling out for the march in the ghostly midst of dawn look like a passage

594
01:03:08.72 --> 01:03:15.44
in the trans migration of souls not sent back to work out the remnant of their sins as animals

595
01:03:15.44 --> 01:03:24.000
but lifted to a third plane by that three days of the underworld eliminating since incorporating

596
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.72
this old there's a word I had to look up trans migration that's basically reincarnation

597
01:03:28.72 --> 01:03:36.08
so they're getting reincarnated not as animals but lifted to a third plane

598
01:03:40.88 --> 01:03:45.92
there was an interesting note on here on the term infantry did you do the

599
01:03:45.92 --> 01:03:55.92
etymology of the word infantry don't know it infant yep the lamest etymology I'd ever heard

600
01:03:55.92 --> 01:04:01.12
I was so bomb that it almost didn't want to talk about it on the podcast but back in the day

601
01:04:02.08 --> 01:04:08.000
the infantry were the people that weren't old enough or mature enough or of high status enough

602
01:04:08.88 --> 01:04:18.48
to fight on horses and so they're infants they're the babies I didn't want to say this I can't

603
01:04:18.48 --> 01:04:27.60
I can't not say it I can't say it's not true but that's where it comes from because what does he say uh

604
01:04:27.92 --> 01:04:31.84
shared in it also come to the opinion that infantry was a good thing to have around however

605
01:04:31.84 --> 01:04:37.52
by some queer break in the hierarchy of honor subordinated to the shavileers the biped

606
01:04:37.52 --> 01:04:43.28
meaning the person to the quadripet meaning the horse and by some freak of etymology named

607
01:04:43.28 --> 01:04:47.28
infantry the speechless because that's another thing like hey you don't need to say anything

608
01:04:47.28 --> 01:04:52.56
you're infantry the speeches us whether because they couldn't talk or because they mustn't tell

609
01:04:54.64 --> 01:04:59.44
sorry infantry troopers of the world you have my utmost respect and I apologize for the

610
01:04:59.44 --> 01:05:06.32
etymology of your name torb they have no idea what to make of it we'll stick with grunts

611
01:05:09.28 --> 01:05:17.04
the troops what's that uh I want to press fields book on on afghanistan the afghanistan campaign

612
01:05:17.04 --> 01:05:22.16
they're one of the infantry guy goes you know what we are we're mules mules that kill yeah

613
01:05:22.16 --> 01:05:29.52
it's all they do is walk and pack gear that's a good one then fight well the the dedication

614
01:05:30.48 --> 01:05:37.36
in about face to all the go boys the ground pounders the grunts the american infantrymen there you go

615
01:05:37.36 --> 01:05:47.44
go and back to the book the troops had enjoyed about four hours of this unwanton rest

616
01:05:47.44 --> 01:05:51.76
when the cavalry having completed its reconnaissance were ordered for it and by the way he talks

617
01:05:51.76 --> 01:05:57.04
about this there's a march that they take place that they have to freaking march their ass off

618
01:05:57.04 --> 01:06:03.76
they to keep up with the cavalry horses we were trying to follow closely we're brought

619
01:06:03.76 --> 01:06:07.84
this is the talking about the march we were trying to try to follow closely we're brought to

620
01:06:07.84 --> 01:06:14.64
frequent standstill this was vexatious another good word for you armen being heard to the feet

621
01:06:14.64 --> 01:06:19.44
in heavy marching order carrying on their backs perhaps three days life for themselves and a pretty

622
01:06:19.44 --> 01:06:25.20
big heavy installment of death and for their antagonist and now compelled every few minutes

623
01:06:25.20 --> 01:06:31.76
to come to a huddled halt in the muddy road marking time and marking place and also with deep

624
01:06:31.76 --> 01:06:37.28
discontent in about two hours we get up to wear shared in wands us i think it's crazy

625
01:06:38.56 --> 01:06:47.60
to that he in this in this elevated book he still talks about the fact that it sucks

626
01:06:47.60 --> 01:06:51.92
when you're walking and you got to stop and then you go and then you stop and then you go

627
01:06:51.92 --> 01:07:00.08
and you stop and it's hurry up and wait he even has to mention that that it's vexatious

628
01:07:00.08 --> 01:07:07.60
to have that happen uh during this impatient waiting for the seemingly slow preparatory

629
01:07:07.60 --> 01:07:12.24
formation our spiritual wheels were lubricated by the flow of discussion explanation about

630
01:07:12.24 --> 01:07:16.80
the plan of attack shared and took a scape a saber a scabbard and described it graphically

631
01:07:16.80 --> 01:07:22.64
on the lighter so this is the this is the classic hey he pulls out his sword and draws in the dirt

632
01:07:22.64 --> 01:07:27.28
what we're gonna do the plan in general is for the cavalry to occupy the enemies attention

633
01:07:27.28 --> 01:07:32.08
by a brisk demonstration along the right front of their works while the fifth course should

634
01:07:32.08 --> 01:07:37.04
fall fall upon their left and rear by a sort of surprise if possible and scoop them out of

635
01:07:37.04 --> 01:07:42.08
their works along the white oak road and capture or disorganize them cover and move

636
01:07:48.16 --> 01:07:53.04
go ahead and we're back to where he was yesterday

637
01:07:53.04 --> 01:07:58.96
because yesterday they were holding white oak road and they got jacked around and

638
01:07:58.96 --> 01:08:02.56
drugged around and walked all the way around and now they're right back where they started

639
01:08:04.80 --> 01:08:09.20
it's amazing that they just didn't just completely get pissed off and throw the rifle down

640
01:08:10.88 --> 01:08:14.96
and there's all kinds of confusion in fact he says illities at such confusion of mind I

641
01:08:14.96 --> 01:08:19.44
wrote over to general Griffin who with general warn was close on my left that the early stage of this

642
01:08:19.44 --> 01:08:23.84
movement and asked for an explanation Griffin answers quickly we will not worry about ourselves

643
01:08:23.84 --> 01:08:28.96
and diagrams we are to follow Crawford circumstances will develop our duty okay

644
01:08:31.68 --> 01:08:34.56
well that's that that's more helpful than that diagram there about again

645
01:08:38.96 --> 01:08:43.12
the start of movie says I halted my line and wrote ahead through the woods to some high

646
01:08:43.12 --> 01:08:49.36
cleared ground the southeast and corner of a large field known as Sidnor Field along the opposite

647
01:08:49.36 --> 01:08:55.36
edge of which I could see strong skirmishing along Crawford's front and turning suddenly looking

648
01:08:55.36 --> 01:09:01.36
across broken scrubby ground could see Aries troops engaged in a confused world of struggling groups

649
01:09:02.56 --> 01:09:08.72
with fitful firing so he's maneuvered into position where he can see what's happening there was

650
01:09:08.72 --> 01:09:14.32
Aries fighting alone and that was not in the program meaning that wasn't part of the plan there was

651
01:09:14.32 --> 01:09:19.52
Griffin down there that was an order enough for me and I took the responsibility of looking out

652
01:09:19.52 --> 01:09:25.36
for the left instead of the right where my last orders committed me I pulled my my brigade out of the

653
01:09:25.36 --> 01:09:31.44
wood by the left flank telling Gregory to follow and sending to Bartlett to let him know what I was

654
01:09:31.44 --> 01:09:37.60
doing pushed across a muddy stream and up through our veen toward Aries halfway up Griffin

655
01:09:37.60 --> 01:09:44.24
came to meet me never more welcome he gave the look I wanted and without coming near another

656
01:09:44.24 --> 01:09:52.32
forward wave me to follow up to the head of the ravine and to attack on my right along the bank where

657
01:09:52.32 --> 01:09:58.48
hidden by brush and scrub the enemy had a line perpendicular to their main one on white oak road

658
01:09:58.48 --> 01:10:02.64
and we're commencing a slant fire and Aries direction Griffin road passed me toward Warren and

659
01:10:02.64 --> 01:10:08.96
Bartlett so there's a bunch of things going on there number one he'd been told to do one thing

660
01:10:08.96 --> 01:10:12.96
but he looks at what's happening and decides I got to do something else and on top of that

661
01:10:12.96 --> 01:10:19.92
he then he actually tells other people hey I'm I'm adjusting the plan here so you know

662
01:10:21.04 --> 01:10:25.84
I'm doing this I mean that's what right looks like yeah that's what right looks like and again

663
01:10:25.84 --> 01:10:30.72
it's when you think about the details he's writing this book the detail that you just pointed out

664
01:10:30.72 --> 01:10:37.28
was important enough to him to put it in here to say uh I let him know what I was doing

665
01:10:37.28 --> 01:10:43.12
and you know when we mentioned on the last podcast about getty's broken hey this guy took

666
01:10:43.12 --> 01:10:47.04
initiative it was good this guy took initiative it was bad what's the difference one of the there's

667
01:10:47.04 --> 01:10:52.000
several differences one of the differences oh I took initiative but didn't tell anyone that's bad

668
01:10:52.64 --> 01:10:58.32
oh I took initiative and tell people what I was getting to do then that's good that's one of the

669
01:10:58.32 --> 01:11:03.84
things that makes it good so again you got to pay attention to what he's paying attention to

670
01:11:03.84 --> 01:11:10.64
he's paying attention to all of us telling us leaders hey when you're gonna change something

671
01:11:10.64 --> 01:11:15.84
you need to let people know what you're doing and then I just thought it's cool you know

672
01:11:15.84 --> 01:11:21.44
talk about relationships and sort of like the silent leader just see the guy look at him I got

673
01:11:21.44 --> 01:11:23.84
you the head nod we're going

674
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.04
Erie's fitful fire was approaching and I rode over towards it somewhere near the angle of the

675
01:11:33.04 --> 01:11:37.68
works I met Sheridan he had probably seen me putting my men in and hence I escaped

676
01:11:37.68 --> 01:11:43.52
censure for appearing indeed his criticism seemed to be that there was not more of me rather than

677
01:11:43.52 --> 01:11:49.60
less oh by God that's what I want to see was his greeting general officers at the front where

678
01:11:49.60 --> 01:11:55.28
your general officers I replied that I'd seen general warrants flag in the big field north of us

679
01:11:55.28 --> 01:12:00.56
and that seeing Erie's was in a tight place I'd come to help him and by general Griffin's order

680
01:12:00.56 --> 01:12:08.24
then cried he with a bigger of utterance worthy of an army and flanders you take command of all the

681
01:12:08.24 --> 01:12:16.08
infantry round here and break this dam I didn't wait to hear any more that made good grammar as it's

682
01:12:16.08 --> 01:12:22.48
stood I didn't stand for anything but spurred back to some scattered groups of men demoralized

683
01:12:22.48 --> 01:12:27.52
by being so far on the rear and not far enough to do them any good yet too brave to go back

684
01:12:27.52 --> 01:12:33.28
Captain forint and of Griffin staff came along and I took him with me down among these men to get them up

685
01:12:33.28 --> 01:12:38.96
I found one stalwart fellow on his hands and knees behind the stump answering with wind

686
01:12:38.96 --> 01:12:44.64
circle grimst grimaces to the bullets coming pretty thick and near look here my good fellow I

687
01:12:44.64 --> 01:12:49.68
called down to him don't you know you'll be killed here in less than two minutes that would be a shame

688
01:12:49.68 --> 01:12:57.44
this is no place for you go forward but what can I do he cried I can't stand up against this

689
01:12:57.44 --> 01:13:06.88
all alone no that's just it I replied we're forming here I want for you to guide sinner up and forward

690
01:13:08.24 --> 01:13:15.20
up and out he came like a hero I formed those reserves on him as a guide in the whole queer

691
01:13:15.20 --> 01:13:23.68
line 200 of them went in right up to the front and like the thick of it my poor fellow only wanted

692
01:13:23.68 --> 01:13:29.28
a token of confidence and appreciation to get possession of himself he was proud of what he did

693
01:13:30.16 --> 01:13:37.68
and so was I for him freaking epic I got goosebumps from that man you know I tell that story

694
01:13:37.68 --> 01:13:42.000
I was at trade-ed and like the mount situations going on and the guys are getting all their

695
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.20
ass kicked with paintball and everything and no one's making any decisions and I walked over to this

696
01:13:47.20 --> 01:13:53.68
one badass E5 and I looked down and I go hey bro I go what do you think you should do right now he's

697
01:13:53.68 --> 01:13:58.32
like we ought to freaking stone that building over there and get some freaking get some cover and I go

698
01:13:59.28 --> 01:14:03.52
why don't you make it happen and the look on his face I wish I had a video he looked at

699
01:14:03.52 --> 01:14:07.60
the look on his face was like wait why don't I make it happen you mean I can make this happen he

700
01:14:07.60 --> 01:14:13.68
was a strong point that building immediately everyone's still he said freaking I think you might have been a

701
01:14:13.68 --> 01:14:18.96
new guy might have been a one cruise wonder off the ask him because I know exactly what it is you know

702
01:14:18.96 --> 01:14:26.08
awesome guy but just that right there I mean then now this is a combat situation dude you just

703
01:14:26.08 --> 01:14:32.32
give that little bit of confidence you take charge this is taking ownership right when you

704
01:14:32.32 --> 01:14:36.56
we start about giving people ownership you give them ownership hey I'm gonna make you the

705
01:14:36.56 --> 01:14:41.52
center people always ask us what do you do when people not motivate give them ownership this is the

706
01:14:41.52 --> 01:14:49.20
example hence forth this is the example of giving ownership I despise running despise it you're

707
01:14:49.20 --> 01:14:54.32
not gonna catch me running unless I'm running toward a chocolate cake away from the police right

708
01:14:54.32 --> 01:15:01.92
but if you tell me to lead a run I can run somehow it's like somehow it's like anyone who's leading

709
01:15:01.92 --> 01:15:06.08
a run when you're doing a conditioning run you're like man they're really setting the space because

710
01:15:06.08 --> 01:15:14.32
somehow you're buoyed up by all those people behind you you own it too yeah general win was

711
01:15:14.32 --> 01:15:20.48
riding up and down their front in a demonstrative manner but giving no sign of forward movement I

712
01:15:20.48 --> 01:15:29.04
thought this strange for him and bad for all of us in the pinch things were at and with the warrant

713
01:15:29.04 --> 01:15:36.16
Sheridan had given me galloped down to him and asked him if he was acting under any particular orders

714
01:15:36.16 --> 01:15:44.56
from general areas no general you replied with an error of relief I've lost areas I have no orders

715
01:15:44.56 --> 01:15:50.48
I don't know what to do then you come with me I said I will take responsibility

716
01:15:51.44 --> 01:15:58.24
you shall have all the credit let me take your brigade for a moment so that's in two pages

717
01:15:58.24 --> 01:16:05.68
you've got giving ownership and taking ownership in two pages in two paragraphs really

718
01:16:06.80 --> 01:16:12.88
and by the way I'll take responsibility you'll have all the credit this dude is like deal

719
01:16:14.16 --> 01:16:24.64
deal and deal uh then Sheridan was by my side in a moment very angry you are firing into my

720
01:16:24.64 --> 01:16:31.92
cavalry here we get blue on blue he exclaims his face darkening with a checked expletive I was

721
01:16:31.92 --> 01:16:37.76
under a little pressure too and put on a bold air then the cavalry have got gotten into the

722
01:16:37.76 --> 01:16:43.60
rebels place one of us will have to get out of the way what we have as do general don't you fire

723
01:16:43.60 --> 01:16:56.96
into my cavalry I'll tell you was the fierce rejoiner so we got this freaking mayhem going on fast forward

724
01:16:56.96 --> 01:17:00.88
a little bit more they kind of sort that out I plunged into my business to make up for a minute

725
01:17:00.88 --> 01:17:06.16
it's lost time my men were still facing too much across areas front and getting into the range

726
01:17:06.16 --> 01:17:13.60
of his fire we had got we had got to change that and swing to the right down the rear of the

727
01:17:13.60 --> 01:17:19.84
enemy's main works it was a whirl every way was a front and every way was a flank the fighting

728
01:17:19.84 --> 01:17:24.96
was hand-a-hand I was trying to get the three angles of the triangle into something like two

729
01:17:24.96 --> 01:17:31.28
right angles and it swung my left well forward opening quite a gap in that direction when a large

730
01:17:31.28 --> 01:17:38.16
body of the enemy came rushing in from that flank and rear they were in line formation with arms

731
01:17:38.16 --> 01:17:43.76
at something like a ready which looked like business I thought it was our turn to be caught between

732
01:17:43.76 --> 01:17:49.12
two fires and that these men were likely to cut their way through us rushing into the ranks of

733
01:17:49.12 --> 01:17:56.96
my left battalion I shouted the order prepared a fire by the rear rank my men faced about at once

734
01:17:56.96 --> 01:18:03.52
disregarding the enemy in the front but at this juncture our portness visitors threw down their

735
01:18:03.52 --> 01:18:10.08
muskets and with hands and faces cried out we surrender running right up upon and almost

736
01:18:10.08 --> 01:18:15.76
over us I was very glad of it the more astonished for they outnumbered us largely

737
01:18:15.76 --> 01:18:27.92
that's the kind of turn of events such a like and it's it is one of those things that reminds me

738
01:18:29.60 --> 01:18:35.68
that he could have surrendered right there he could have surrendered you know well we're surrounded

739
01:18:35.68 --> 01:18:42.88
hey everyone drop your weapons it's that it's going that extra little moment right that extra

740
01:18:42.88 --> 01:18:51.60
what happens in fighting in boxing and MMA fighting where that extra like I'll go one more round

741
01:18:51.60 --> 01:19:02.24
who was it was that Ali Frischer and Ali had returned to his corner saying take off my

742
01:19:02.24 --> 01:19:08.16
take off my gloves like I'm done and they you know they're basically no you're not done he's like no

743
01:19:08.16 --> 01:19:16.40
I'm done and they said no you're not done so he's okay and I think it was Frischer said he was done

744
01:19:16.40 --> 01:19:22.32
didn't answer the bell so he won but he was just that he could have easily surrendered but he did

745
01:19:22.32 --> 01:19:27.20
held on for a little bit longer so he kicks into that too like those kind of his

746
01:19:27.20 --> 01:19:31.76
remember when he when he was young again to Zulu what happened where he that he just felt like

747
01:19:31.76 --> 01:19:37.76
now I'm kind of done and they're like oh yeah that's right he got to the after the first round

748
01:19:38.56 --> 01:19:44.48
big bring hex and the side and they're like hey hex and says I'm done man I'm done like I can't this

749
01:19:44.48 --> 01:19:50.000
isn't going to work I'm done I'm physically exhausted and they say no you're not done yet son

750
01:19:56.72 --> 01:20:01.12
this battle continues the hardest hold up wasn't front of my left center the first

751
01:20:01.12 --> 01:20:05.68
baton of the hundred and ninety eighth Pennsylvania I wrote up to the Gallant Glen commanding it

752
01:20:05.68 --> 01:20:10.48
and said major Glen if you will break that line you shall have a Colonel's commission

753
01:20:11.84 --> 01:20:18.56
it was a hasty utterance and the promise unmilitary perhaps but my every energy was focused on

754
01:20:18.56 --> 01:20:24.64
that moment's issue nor did that earnest soldier need a personal inducement he was already carrying

755
01:20:24.64 --> 01:20:29.44
out the general order to press the enemy before him with as much effect as we could reasonably

756
01:20:29.44 --> 01:20:36.32
expect but it was deep in my mind how richly he already deserved this promotion and I was

757
01:20:36.32 --> 01:20:43.44
resolved that he should get it now it was this thought and purpose which no doubt shaped my phrase

758
01:20:43.44 --> 01:20:50.80
and pardoned it Glen sprung among his men calling out boys will you follow me

759
01:20:51.92 --> 01:20:57.92
wield his horse and dashed forward without turning to see who followed nor did he need

760
01:20:57.92 --> 01:21:03.44
his words were a question his act in order

761
01:21:06.08 --> 01:21:13.04
yeah he doesn't say doesn't give nori literally ask the question will you follow me and then

762
01:21:13.04 --> 01:21:23.12
goes leadership by example and whatever kind of relationship and respect he had from his troops

763
01:21:23.12 --> 01:21:31.76
that when they see him go they go his words were a question his act in order

764
01:21:32.48 --> 01:21:38.48
on the brave fellows go with a cheer into the hurricane of fire their beautiful flags

765
01:21:38.48 --> 01:21:44.96
sways gray footh gracefully aloft with the spring of brave youth bearing it lighting the battle smoke

766
01:21:44.96 --> 01:21:52.56
three times it goes down to earth covered in darkening eddies but rises ever again passing

767
01:21:52.56 --> 01:22:01.36
from hand to hand of don'tless young heroes then bullet torn and blood blazing it hovers for a moment

768
01:22:01.36 --> 01:22:08.72
above the breastwork while the regiment goes over like a wave this I saw from my position to the

769
01:22:08.72 --> 01:22:15.76
left where I was pressing on the rest of my command the site brought upon me that I snatched

770
01:22:15.76 --> 01:22:25.44
time to ride over and congratulate Glen and his regiment as I passed into a deeper shadow of the woods

771
01:22:27.36 --> 01:22:32.72
I met two men bearing his body the dripping blood marking their path

772
01:22:32.72 --> 01:22:43.04
they stopped to tell me I saw it all too well he had snatched a battle flag from a broken

773
01:22:43.04 --> 01:22:49.04
regiment trying to rally on its colors when a broop bullet of the earth once pronounced good

774
01:22:49.04 --> 01:23:00.48
but since cursed for man sin struck him down to its level I could not stop I could stop but for a moment

775
01:23:00.48 --> 01:23:08.16
for still on my front was rush and turmoil and tragedy I could only bend down over him from the

776
01:23:08.16 --> 01:23:17.36
saddle and murmur unavailing words general I have carried out your wishes this was his only

777
01:23:17.36 --> 01:23:29.60
utterance it was as if another bullet had cut through me I fell almost across my saddle my wish

778
01:23:31.36 --> 01:23:39.28
God in heaven no more my wish than thine that this fair body still part of the unfallen good

779
01:23:39.28 --> 01:23:46.72
should be smitten to the sod that this spirit born of thine should be quenched by the accursed

780
01:23:49.20 --> 01:23:55.76
what dark miss giving searched me as I took the import of these words what sharp sense of

781
01:23:55.76 --> 01:24:02.24
responsibility for those who have committed to them the issues of life and death why should I have

782
01:24:02.24 --> 01:24:08.72
not let this onset take its general course and mend their natural chances why choose him out

783
01:24:08.72 --> 01:24:15.60
for his death and so take on myself the awful decision into what home irreparable loss and

784
01:24:15.60 --> 01:24:24.16
measureless desolation should cast their unliftered burden the crowding fought choked utterance

785
01:24:26.08 --> 01:24:30.96
I could only bend my face low to his and answer

786
01:24:30.96 --> 01:24:44.72
Colonel I will remember my promise I will remember you and press forward to my place where

787
01:24:44.72 --> 01:24:53.52
the crash and crushing agony of the struggle summoned me more to more of the same war

788
01:24:53.52 --> 01:25:06.000
nothing but the final infinite good for man and God can accept and justify human work like that

789
01:25:23.52 --> 01:25:36.96
yeah that some that massive burden that he feels just absolutely hitting him

790
01:25:53.84 --> 01:25:57.12
yeah again there's not much for me to say on that

791
01:26:01.92 --> 01:26:03.68
and even with that the battle's not over

792
01:26:06.48 --> 01:26:11.04
go forward a little bit and we had now come to the edge of a wide field across the road

793
01:26:11.04 --> 01:26:16.56
and the works on the enemies right known as the Gillum field here I came to share it in

794
01:26:16.56 --> 01:26:22.72
Griffin my troops all up in well in hand a sharp cavalry fight was going on in which some of Erie's

795
01:26:22.72 --> 01:26:30.72
men and my own had taken part when our line was checked at the last angle Griffin had ordered

796
01:26:30.72 --> 01:26:39.44
one of Crawford's kernels to advance the Colonel a brave well-balanced man replied that

797
01:26:40.16 --> 01:26:45.92
where soldiers as good as Griffin's men had failed he did not feel warranted in going in

798
01:26:45.92 --> 01:26:55.76
without proper orders very well I ordered you in says Griffin without adding that he did it as

799
01:26:55.76 --> 01:27:06.16
commander of the corps so there's a Colonel sitting there and there's this battle going on

800
01:27:07.84 --> 01:27:15.20
and Griffin says hey you need to get in there and the Colonel says well hey I don't think I should

801
01:27:15.20 --> 01:27:18.88
go in there if these guys can't get it done I'll pick out school in there unless I'm under orders

802
01:27:18.88 --> 01:27:25.04
and Griffin says very well then I order you in so he gives a little push back hey this doesn't seem

803
01:27:25.04 --> 01:27:31.92
like a great call and then he gets told you're going in the Gallant Colonel Bows he is Richardson

804
01:27:31.92 --> 01:27:39.68
of the seventh Wisconsin grass his regimental colors in his own hand significant of the need of his

805
01:27:39.68 --> 01:27:47.76
resolution in face of it and rides forward in advance of his men what can they do but follow such

806
01:27:47.76 --> 01:27:56.08
example general warrant with intensity of feeling that is now desperation snatches his

807
01:27:56.08 --> 01:28:05.28
core flag from the hands of its bearer and dashes up to Richardson side and so the two leaders

808
01:28:05.28 --> 01:28:12.40
ride the corps commander and his last visible Colonel colors aloft reckless of the growing distance

809
01:28:12.40 --> 01:28:18.56
between them and their followers straight for the smoking line straight for the flaming edge not

810
01:28:18.56 --> 01:28:25.84
hesitating at the breastworks over they go one with swelling tumult of soul where the passion of

811
01:28:25.84 --> 01:28:37.12
suffering craves outburst in action the other with obedience and self devotion love like stronger than death

812
01:28:37.12 --> 01:28:43.44
over the breastworks down among the astonished foe one of whom instinct over mastering

813
01:28:43.44 --> 01:28:51.12
admiration aims at the foremost a deadly blow which the noble youth rushes forward the parry

814
01:28:51.12 --> 01:28:57.60
and shielding with his own breast of his certain of his uncaring commander falls to earth

815
01:28:57.60 --> 01:29:09.60
bathing his colors with his blood need more be told do men tarried such a point

816
01:29:09.60 --> 01:29:19.04
one crested wave sweeps on another broken rolls away all as lost and all as one

817
01:29:21.20 --> 01:29:24.72
slowly worn in returns over the somber field

818
01:29:24.72 --> 01:29:42.88
so that's just an unbelievable scene you know it's just an unbelievable scene if you

819
01:29:42.88 --> 01:29:50.72
tried to make that an a movie it wouldn't seem realistic that this guy Richardson gets told hey

820
01:29:50.72 --> 01:29:56.88
you need to charge he says I don't think I should do that without proper orders his boss says

821
01:29:56.88 --> 01:30:04.24
these are your orders go and as he takes off towards the melee the overall leader

822
01:30:06.56 --> 01:30:10.96
without saying a word just grabs his flag and joins him by his side

823
01:30:10.96 --> 01:30:22.08
once they get to the enemy lines somebody takes aim at Warren and Richardson basically jumps

824
01:30:22.08 --> 01:30:26.80
in front of he says blow I don't know if he's a shot or if it was a sword or what it was but

825
01:30:26.80 --> 01:30:35.20
I'm assuming he was shot and Richardson takes the round I mean they consider like an enemy

826
01:30:35.20 --> 01:30:39.36
breastworks and they're coming over it in their horses and then once they come over they got to

827
01:30:39.36 --> 01:30:43.92
be in and amongst them so it could have been either could have been a sword I guess

828
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.76
they in that yeah

829
01:30:55.68 --> 01:31:02.32
and then this happens as it is forsaken at its forsaken edge a staff officer hands him this is

830
01:31:02.32 --> 01:31:10.16
Warren this is a Warren walks back after this or it's rides back after this and a staff officer

831
01:31:10.16 --> 01:31:16.48
hands him a crude field order partly by the lured fast flashes of Alaska it's partly by the

832
01:31:16.48 --> 01:31:24.32
light of the dying day he reads quote major general Warren commanding the fifth army court is

833
01:31:24.32 --> 01:31:29.76
relieved from duty and will at once report for orders to lieutenant journal general grant

834
01:31:29.76 --> 01:31:34.88
commanding arms the united states by command of major general shared and quote

835
01:31:38.64 --> 01:31:43.84
so he just got fired with almost the agony of death upon his face

836
01:31:43.84 --> 01:31:50.000
Warren approaches shared and and ask him if he cannot reconsider the order reconsider

837
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.52
hell I don't reconsider my decisions obey the order

838
01:31:53.52 --> 01:32:02.72
that was the last thunderbolt on Warren's heart the battle has done its worst for him

839
01:32:02.72 --> 01:32:06.72
the iron has entered his soul

840
01:32:10.72 --> 01:32:16.56
so all that kind of mayhem and disorganization and all those different orders and stuff

841
01:32:16.56 --> 01:32:25.92
cause eventually him to get fired and there's some details in the book about

842
01:32:26.72 --> 01:32:36.80
him moving to slow him not being at the front so fast forward a little bit suddenly emerge from

843
01:32:36.80 --> 01:32:43.84
the shadows a compact form with vigorous stride unlike the measure and mood of ours and a voice

844
01:32:43.84 --> 01:32:50.56
that would itself have thrilled us had it not had not the import of it thrilled us more

845
01:32:50.56 --> 01:32:57.36
gentlemen says shared in as we have started to our feet I've come to see you I may have

846
01:32:57.36 --> 01:33:03.76
spoken harshly to some of you today but I would not have it hurt you you know how it is

847
01:33:03.76 --> 01:33:08.48
we had to carry this place and I was threaded all day till it was done you must forgive me

848
01:33:08.48 --> 01:33:18.80
I know it is hard for the men too but we must push there's more for us to do together I appreciate

849
01:33:18.80 --> 01:33:27.44
and thank you all and this is Phil Sheridan a new view of him surely and amazingly all the

850
01:33:27.44 --> 01:33:32.80
repressed feeling of our hearts sprung out toward him we were ready to blame ourselves if we had been

851
01:33:32.80 --> 01:33:42.000
in any way the cause of his trouble but we thought we had borne a better part than that so this

852
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.16
guy shared in who's been barking orders and stuff all day now rolls in after he fires Warren

853
01:33:48.96 --> 01:33:57.20
and says hey guys look I know it's hard today but I'm sorry I was wrong you know you must forgive

854
01:33:57.20 --> 01:34:07.12
me he's asking for forgiveness and I mean it landed apparently really well you know

855
01:34:07.12 --> 01:34:14.80
you know because reading this it's it's really apparent that Chamberlain is sympathetic to one

856
01:34:15.68 --> 01:34:21.68
and ain't all that thrilled with Sheridan and then you know you see his response there when Sheridan

857
01:34:21.68 --> 01:34:29.92
was smart yeah takes ownership of it and re-regaining some leadership capital because

858
01:34:31.12 --> 01:34:38.88
apologizing requires to do huge checking your ego yeah I can't think of a situation where

859
01:34:38.88 --> 01:34:45.12
anyone loses respect for you when you apologize yeah yeah this is a good case of that

860
01:34:45.12 --> 01:34:54.80
um yeah we just went through that whole thing with uh with Joe Rogan and you know him apologizing

861
01:34:54.80 --> 01:35:00.16
and there was a bunch of people and I I just basically tried to lend support to him and say in that

862
01:35:01.04 --> 01:35:11.68
hey let's the guys apologize forgiveness is a virtue that we should all try and go after and try and

863
01:35:11.68 --> 01:35:18.96
represent and so when somebody makes a mistake you know that's what forgiveness is for and a bunch of

864
01:35:18.96 --> 01:35:23.44
people I don't want you people with some people we're saying you should never apologize no it's never

865
01:35:23.44 --> 01:35:28.000
I hear that two with leaders leader sale it's weak to apologize man if you mess something up

866
01:35:28.96 --> 01:35:34.56
then apologize and hey in a minimum if I say something to you that maybe

867
01:35:34.56 --> 01:35:42.08
maybe I offended you what did I want to offend you and if I didn't maybe if maybe if it's uh

868
01:35:42.08 --> 01:35:47.60
you know I say well geez Jason you know you're you and your stupid freaking blonde hair right

869
01:35:48.88 --> 01:35:52.24
you know and all of a sudden I realized that you know used to get picked on for that

870
01:35:53.12 --> 01:35:58.64
and even though I meant it as a joke but it offended you does that mean well hey I didn't know

871
01:35:58.64 --> 01:36:03.28
I didn't know that you used to get picked on because of that I'm not apologizing no it's actually

872
01:36:03.28 --> 01:36:08.24
hey man I'm sorry the way I said it and the thing that I didn't know was gonna offend you

873
01:36:08.24 --> 01:36:12.64
offended you and I'm sorry about that but there's nothing wrong when you make a mistake of saying sorry

874
01:36:13.20 --> 01:36:16.000
nothing wrong what I really appreciated about

875
01:36:17.28 --> 01:36:24.32
Rogan's apology is that he wasn't sidestepping any consequences yeah well you know just because you say

876
01:36:24.32 --> 01:36:28.88
or sorry doesn't mean there are no consequences well hey it's all good I apologize no but he

877
01:36:28.88 --> 01:36:34.72
he took ownership of what happened he wasn't trying to wheeze aloud of any consequences and I thought

878
01:36:35.60 --> 01:36:42.88
that it was a huge lesson on how what the right thing to do is when something comes out and

879
01:36:44.08 --> 01:36:48.72
I actually gained quite a bit of respect I had a few amount of respect for Joe before that but

880
01:36:48.72 --> 01:36:56.24
but his apology was was heartfelt and sincere and it wasn't an attempt to avoid consequences

881
01:36:56.24 --> 01:37:02.000
yeah which is awesome and when you make a mistake as a leader when you pick the wrong plan

882
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:09.28
when I say hey Jason I want you to you know can you prep this freaking brief for me and then

883
01:37:10.08 --> 01:37:14.16
it turns out we don't need to do the brief and I'm like hey man I know you worked for two weeks on

884
01:37:14.16 --> 01:37:19.84
that thing and we didn't even need to even do it I'm sorry man as opposed to saying well you know

885
01:37:19.84 --> 01:37:24.40
we could have used it or whatever just making up the big cover up the big lie you know

886
01:37:24.40 --> 01:37:28.64
interesting hey man I'm so sorry I know I wait you wasted two weeks working on that

887
01:37:28.64 --> 01:37:32.72
working on that brief and we ended up not using it I should have done a better I should have done

888
01:37:32.72 --> 01:37:37.84
more groundwork to make sure we're gonna need it and I'm sorry you respect for me doesn't go down

889
01:37:37.84 --> 01:37:45.12
it goes up you know it's like I was wrong and when I when I was when as I'm reading this and I'm

890
01:37:45.12 --> 01:37:51.68
and I I'm like oh god here come Sharon again he's gonna yell at him and then he had like oh look

891
01:37:51.68 --> 01:37:57.12
at him go he's apologizing and then he writes about like hey we were all as soon as he did that he

892
01:37:57.12 --> 01:38:04.32
completely flipped their feelings towards him yep a new view of him surely and amazingly

893
01:38:05.68 --> 01:38:10.64
if that's such a great case for taking ownership and apologizing when you screw something up

894
01:38:10.64 --> 01:38:23.84
he's talking a little bit about about about the the personalities and the attitudes and one

895
01:38:23.84 --> 01:38:29.68
thing he's talking about Sheridan so this is sort of a detached moment he says Sheridan does not

896
01:38:29.68 --> 01:38:35.60
entrench he pushes on carrying his flank and rear with him rushing flashing smashing he

897
01:38:35.60 --> 01:38:42.08
transfuses into his subordinates the vitality and energy of his purpose transforms them into

898
01:38:42.08 --> 01:38:47.04
part of his own mind and will he shows the power of a commander inspiring both confidence and

899
01:38:47.04 --> 01:38:54.80
fear as a rule are core and army commanders were men of brains rather than magnetism they

900
01:38:54.80 --> 01:39:03.04
relied on brains in others war and was one of these he was well capable of organizing an entire plan

901
01:39:03.04 --> 01:39:09.12
of battle on a great field he would have been an admirable chief of staff of the army so he's

902
01:39:09.12 --> 01:39:14.80
good again this is the personality of war and war and was like not a dynamic charismatic individual

903
01:39:14.80 --> 01:39:21.60
he was good at planning they're brains out way temperaments and when you're coming up with a plan

904
01:39:21.60 --> 01:39:28.64
your brains are more important he could see the whole comprehensively and adjusts the parts to subordinate

905
01:39:28.64 --> 01:39:35.52
but he had a certain order of temperament which although it brought him distinction as a subordinate

906
01:39:35.52 --> 01:39:42.88
commander seemed to work against him as a core commander yeah this is man you got it you got a

907
01:39:43.60 --> 01:39:50.96
you got to adjust look what we'll get into it well we'll just do it now you look if you are the

908
01:39:52.88 --> 01:39:56.48
the second in command if you're the chief operating option you got to make things happen

909
01:39:56.48 --> 01:40:00.72
and you're the one that goes hey Jason you need to get the shit done right now and you're like yeah

910
01:40:00.72 --> 01:40:09.44
got it boss and then I elevate to being the CEO I need to change my behavior and I need to be the

911
01:40:10.40 --> 01:40:17.60
be the the the bigger personality the the more positive personality that's what I need to do

912
01:40:18.88 --> 01:40:24.88
the the more charismatic the more dynamic I don't want to be the one in the weeds when I'm over all in

913
01:40:24.88 --> 01:40:30.80
charge now if I have the personality where I'm like hey I'm a great at coming up with the plans

914
01:40:30.80 --> 01:40:36.32
and this is the way we're going to do this that's cool but when I promote above that and now I

915
01:40:36.32 --> 01:40:40.88
got to show the vision you got to you got to adjust and you got to grow and you got to mature

916
01:40:41.92 --> 01:40:46.16
and by the way sometimes you go back down to that position because you could be leading a department

917
01:40:46.16 --> 01:40:50.56
where you got to be kind of charismatic and and then you get promoted to CEO oh now you got to be like

918
01:40:50.56 --> 01:40:55.84
a little bit more of the the planner and a little bit more mechanical and then you get promoted CEO

919
01:40:55.84 --> 01:41:03.36
and now you got to be back to the dynamic individual again so so part of the reason I want to say

920
01:41:03.36 --> 01:41:12.56
that is because yes you have a personality we all have a personality but you don't necessarily

921
01:41:12.56 --> 01:41:18.88
you don't have to behave the same way and like I when I was an unassistant platoon commander

922
01:41:18.88 --> 01:41:26.24
you know I had to subdue some of my enthusiasm about things when I I was more into the

923
01:41:26.24 --> 01:41:31.52
detailed planning hey I got that paperwork let me run that when I was a platoon commander

924
01:41:31.52 --> 01:41:36.80
all of a sudden I stepped up into the more dynamic role got out of the details

925
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.40
and that's what you're going to have to do throughout your career and you have to pay attention

926
01:41:44.40 --> 01:41:50.48
to what your personality sort of lends itself to there was guys that I work for that were

927
01:41:50.48 --> 01:41:55.36
executive officers the number two in command at a sealed team and they were great executive

928
01:41:55.36 --> 01:42:02.08
officers as commanding officers maybe not so great there was people that were great commanding

929
01:42:02.08 --> 01:42:09.28
officers as executive officers maybe not so great they just have a personality but at least you

930
01:42:09.28 --> 01:42:15.36
should you should know where your parent personality is and then modulate your personality

931
01:42:15.36 --> 01:42:20.96
to the job that you're in yeah and the only way you're going to do that is to attach

932
01:42:20.96 --> 01:42:27.12
yeah no that's the only way otherwise you just swept away by your personality yeah and I

933
01:42:28.08 --> 01:42:33.04
so that you know in the Navy every two years you're promoting right about the time you figure

934
01:42:33.04 --> 01:42:38.56
out how to do that job you get up to the next job and then you're doing the next job like that last

935
01:42:38.56 --> 01:42:46.48
job for a little while until you figure things out hopefully you figured out I didn't it didn't

936
01:42:46.48 --> 01:42:50.72
just work out for Warren there's there's a whole bunch of circumstances work things didn't work out

937
01:42:50.72 --> 01:42:54.48
for Warren and maybe another subsets is what had been fine but it didn't sound like he was

938
01:42:55.76 --> 01:43:00.88
the dynamic leader and that's that is a hard thing to do because you're going to start out doing

939
01:43:00.88 --> 01:43:09.12
what you know and unless you're willing to take feedback and so you know the 360 feedback is something

940
01:43:09.12 --> 01:43:14.32
that we started doing in the teams and so you get feedback from your subordinates and not painful

941
01:43:14.32 --> 01:43:20.72
to hear if you look at that stuff sometimes you're like oh but it's so liberating because you're like oh

942
01:43:20.72 --> 01:43:28.48
okay and you can tell when you read the feedback on who's and kiss an ass and who's just angry

943
01:43:28.48 --> 01:43:31.52
about everything and they're just going to be anger about it and who's giving you on a speedback

944
01:43:31.52 --> 01:43:35.28
it's like oh I got to stop doing that or just that or I'm stepping on that guy's toes

945
01:43:36.72 --> 01:43:45.36
and pull it back. Still still here talking about Warren he said it led him to go in

946
01:43:45.84 --> 01:43:50.40
personally with a single division or brigade when a sharp fight came on doing this when he

947
01:43:50.40 --> 01:43:54.48
went having a larger command one takes a risk of losing grasp of the whole so he's going into

948
01:43:54.48 --> 01:43:58.72
that like hey I'm used to doing this job down in the weeds I'm going to get down the weeds

949
01:43:59.52 --> 01:44:03.20
that was what he did trying to change the front with Crawford's division under fire it was a

950
01:44:03.20 --> 01:44:08.40
difficult thing he put his personality into it which is what you just said Jason just as shared

951
01:44:08.40 --> 01:44:20.24
and would do and did in this very fight there's a whole section that covers some of that criticism

952
01:44:20.24 --> 01:44:27.84
about Warren and his subordinates and and Chamberlain goes on to say these accusations against

953
01:44:27.84 --> 01:44:33.84
the conduct of each of Warren's divisions while susceptible of being magnified and manipulated

954
01:44:33.84 --> 01:44:41.36
so as to produce a certain forensic effect are of no substantial weight even if true in the sharpest

955
01:44:41.36 --> 01:44:46.88
sense so even if Warren's subordinates were totally jacked up look he's saying look you can create

956
01:44:46.88 --> 01:44:51.04
you can look in the back and say like oh these guys were bad this guy did this wrong this guy

957
01:44:51.04 --> 01:44:58.24
did that wrong you can produce a certain forensic effect but even if that's true in the sharpest

958
01:44:58.24 --> 01:45:04.32
sense they would be overstrained and uncalled for considering how the battle ended and by whom

959
01:45:04.32 --> 01:45:13.04
it was mainly fought in a military and highly proper sense general Warren was responsible for the

960
01:45:13.04 --> 01:45:21.52
conduct of his core and ultimately for that of each of his divisions there you have it you got

961
01:45:22.32 --> 01:45:27.20
people that work for you you got departments under you got divisions underneath you got platoons

962
01:45:27.20 --> 01:45:33.68
or battalions or companies underneath you you are responsible for what all those people do

963
01:45:36.96 --> 01:45:42.88
there are two ways in which such control might be exercised by prevention or by correction

964
01:45:42.88 --> 01:45:46.08
so i'm either going to say jayson you know what you're not doing this job well you're not doing

965
01:45:46.08 --> 01:45:50.56
this job you're fired or hey jayson you're not doing this job well here's the corrections you need to make

966
01:45:51.12 --> 01:45:56.56
that's what you do for hey jayson i know that you're going to set everything on fire

967
01:45:56.56 --> 01:46:01.68
don't set everything on fire which is correction right which is preventive i guess that's prevention

968
01:46:01.68 --> 01:46:07.92
yes that's prevention prevention um it was Crawford's duty to keep his vital connection with

969
01:46:07.92 --> 01:46:12.88
airies and if in any way should be broken to be on the alert to see an act Warren should hold him

970
01:46:12.88 --> 01:46:18.48
risk should hold him responsible for that and if he knew he could not at the start rouse crow

971
01:46:18.48 --> 01:46:24.24
Crawford who's peculiarities he knew to a vivid conception of the anatomy and physiology of the

972
01:46:24.24 --> 01:46:30.40
case he should have had a staff officer charged with the duty of keeping Crawford closed on airies

973
01:46:30.40 --> 01:46:35.60
while he himself at the point where he could keep in touch with his whole core and hold Griffin

974
01:46:35.60 --> 01:46:41.44
under his hand at the ready and trusted reserve prepared for the unexpected so he's saying the

975
01:46:41.44 --> 01:46:45.92
same thing you and i just said like if if ek if ek was a little bit of a wild man and a not

976
01:46:45.92 --> 01:46:51.84
quite sure he's going to do cool i take jayson my trusted guy and say hey man go with ekko let me

977
01:46:51.84 --> 01:46:57.52
know what he's doing he gets a little wild sometimes you and Dave called that preemptive ownership preemptive

978
01:46:57.52 --> 01:47:03.68
ownership good deal if there you go cover down

979
01:47:03.68 --> 01:47:11.28
i get a think of the slack and now we get to apomotics apomatics fast forward a little bit

980
01:47:11.28 --> 01:47:16.16
i'm about to speak of what came under my observation in the action to apomotic apomatics

981
01:47:16.16 --> 01:47:21.20
courthouse and the circumstances attending the surrender of the army of northern Virginia April

982
01:47:21.20 --> 01:47:31.36
9th 1865 so now there are 20 25 miles or so from five forks the battle that they were just in

983
01:47:31.36 --> 01:47:38.40
this is a week later eight days later something like that they had to march that that time

984
01:47:39.20 --> 01:47:43.68
he says the fifth court had a very hard march that day made more so in the afternoon and night

985
01:47:43.68 --> 01:47:50.24
by the lumbering obstructions of the rear of ords tired column by courtesy given the road before us

986
01:47:50.24 --> 01:47:57.28
the incestant checkfreading our men almost to mutiny we had been rushed all day to keep up with

987
01:47:57.28 --> 01:48:03.36
the cavalry but this constant checking was worse we did not know that grant had set orders to the

988
01:48:03.36 --> 01:48:08.48
fifth court of march all night without halting but it was not necessary for us to know it after

989
01:48:08.48 --> 01:48:14.72
29 miles of this kind of marching at the blackest hour of night human nature had called a halt

990
01:48:16.40 --> 01:48:23.36
dropping by the roadside left and right wet or dry down went men as in a soon swoon

991
01:48:23.36 --> 01:48:29.04
officers slid out of the saddle loosened the girth slipped an arm through the loop of a bridal rain

992
01:48:29.04 --> 01:48:34.96
and sunk to sleep horses stood with drooping heads just above their master's faces all dreaming

993
01:48:34.96 --> 01:48:40.40
one nose not of what of past or coming possible or faded

994
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.60
scarcely as the first broken dream begun when a cavalry man comes splashing down the road and

995
01:48:47.60 --> 01:48:54.08
vigorously dismounts pulling from his jacket crumpled note the sentinel standing watch by his

996
01:48:54.08 --> 01:49:00.08
commander worn in body but alerted every sense touches your shoulder or to sir I think you rise on

997
01:49:00.08 --> 01:49:06.72
your elbow strike a match and with smarting streaming eyes read the brief thrilling note from

998
01:49:06.72 --> 01:49:14.40
Sheridan like this as I remember quote I have cut across the enemy at apomotics apomatics station

999
01:49:14.40 --> 01:49:22.000
and captured three of his trains if you can possibly push your infantry up here tonight we will have

1000
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:32.08
great results in the morning end quote ah no more sleep the startling bugle notes the ring out

1001
01:49:32.64 --> 01:49:38.08
to the march word is sent for the men to take a bite of such as they had for food the promised

1002
01:49:38.08 --> 01:49:45.52
rations would not be up till noon and by that time we should be where they don't even know

1003
01:49:47.20 --> 01:49:52.000
they are there men shivering to their senses as if written out of rizn out of the earth

1004
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:58.32
but something in them not of it now sounds the forward for the last time in our long drawn

1005
01:49:58.32 --> 01:50:05.68
strife and they move these men sleepless, subtrolous, breakfastless, sore-footed stiff-dueened

1006
01:50:05.68 --> 01:50:16.64
sense-be-numbed but with flushed faces pressing for the front some hard men freaking hard

1007
01:50:20.56 --> 01:50:28.24
they march eventually they arrive on station I ride straight to Sheridan a dark smile and impetus

1008
01:50:28.24 --> 01:50:36.16
gesture are my only orders forward into double lines of battle past Sheridan his guns as cavalry

1009
01:50:36.16 --> 01:50:43.44
and on for the quivering crest for a moment it is a glorious sight every arm of the service in full play

1010
01:50:43.44 --> 01:50:51.04
cavalry artillery infantry then a sudden shift shifting scene as the cavalry disengaged by

1011
01:50:51.04 --> 01:50:56.08
successive squadrons rally under their bugle calls with beautiful precision and prompt the two

1012
01:50:56.08 --> 01:51:02.56
and sweep like a storm cloud beyond our right to close in on the enemy's left and complete the

1013
01:51:02.56 --> 01:51:09.68
faithful envelopment we take up battle, Gregory follows in on my left it is a formidable

1014
01:51:09.68 --> 01:51:16.80
way front we make the scene darkens in a few minutes the tide is turned the incoming wave is at high

1015
01:51:16.80 --> 01:51:23.52
flood the barrier recedes in truth the stone wall men hardly show their well-proved metal

1016
01:51:23.52 --> 01:51:29.84
they seem astonished to see before them familiar flags of their old antagonist not having thought

1017
01:51:29.84 --> 01:51:35.84
it possible that we could match our cavalry and march around and across their pressing columns

1018
01:51:37.12 --> 01:51:42.08
and I don't think I did a good job of laying out the way that went but these soldiers had

1019
01:51:42.08 --> 01:51:48.08
marched to keep up with the cavalry and it got in there in 29 miles in a very short period of time

1020
01:51:48.08 --> 01:51:54.96
their last hope is gone to break through our cavalry before our infantry can get up

1021
01:51:55.76 --> 01:52:01.68
neither to Danville nor to Lynchburg can they cut their way and close upon their rear five miles

1022
01:52:01.68 --> 01:52:08.08
away are pressing the second and sixth core of the army of the Potomac it is the end they are now

1023
01:52:08.08 --> 01:52:15.68
giving way but keep up good front by force of old habit halfway up the slope they make a stand

1024
01:52:15.68 --> 01:52:22.000
with what perhaps they think a good omen behind a stone wall I try a little artillery on them

1025
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.72
which directs their thoughts towards the crest behind them and stiffens my lines for a rush

1026
01:52:28.08 --> 01:52:36.24
anxious for that crust myself crest myself but now comes up ord with a positive order don't

1027
01:52:36.24 --> 01:52:42.000
expose your lines on that crest the enemy of mass their guns to hat to give it a raking fire the

1028
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:49.76
moment you set foot there I thought I saw a qualifying look as he turned away but left alone

1029
01:52:49.76 --> 01:52:55.52
youth struggled with prudence my troops were in a bad position down here I did not like to be

1030
01:52:56.24 --> 01:53:02.24
the the underdog it was much better to be on top and at least know what was there beyond

1031
01:53:03.36 --> 01:53:09.20
so I thought of grant and his permission to quote push things when we got them going and

1032
01:53:09.20 --> 01:53:14.72
of shared and in his last words as he wrote away with his cavalry smiting his hands together quote

1033
01:53:14.72 --> 01:53:23.60
now smash him I tell you smash him and quote so we took this for orders and on the crest we stood

1034
01:53:24.24 --> 01:53:31.36
one booming cannon shot past close along our front and in the next moment all was still so

1035
01:53:31.36 --> 01:53:38.96
he gets told don't go up to that crest but he's in a bad situation anyways and he thinks

1036
01:53:38.96 --> 01:53:47.76
hey I'm this isn't good what are some other orders I've received recently well I've also got told to

1037
01:53:47.76 --> 01:53:52.56
push things I've also got told to smash him so I'm going to take some initiative here and we're

1038
01:53:52.56 --> 01:53:58.000
going I'm going to get to that crest and when he gets up there turns out there's just one cannon shot

1039
01:53:59.68 --> 01:54:05.52
we had done it had exposed ourselves to the view of the enemy but it was an exposure that worked

1040
01:54:05.52 --> 01:54:13.52
two ways for their burst upon our vision of mighty scene fitcanes the story of tumultuous years

1041
01:54:13.52 --> 01:54:19.28
encompassed by the cordon of steel that crown the heights about the courthouse on the slopes of the

1042
01:54:19.28 --> 01:54:27.28
valley formed by the sources of the apomotics lay the remnants of that far-famed army counterpart

1043
01:54:27.28 --> 01:54:34.08
and companion of our own in momentous history the army of northern Virginia. Lease army

1044
01:54:34.08 --> 01:54:41.52
and so now he's standing up in this position looking down and can see the entire scene from his

1045
01:54:41.52 --> 01:54:51.04
elevated position and including the apomotics apomatics sorry around and here's what he describes

1046
01:54:51.04 --> 01:54:59.44
around its edges now trodden to myor swarms and indescribable crowd worn out soldier struggling

1047
01:54:59.44 --> 01:55:06.72
to the front demoralized citizen and denizen white black and all shades between following

1048
01:55:06.72 --> 01:55:13.76
Lease army or flying before these suddenly confronted terrible Yankees pictured to them as demon shape

1049
01:55:13.76 --> 01:55:20.64
and bent animals too of all forms and grades vehicles of every description and non-description

1050
01:55:20.64 --> 01:55:26.72
public and domestic four-wheeled or two or one heading and moving in every direction

1051
01:55:26.72 --> 01:55:36.16
asswarning massive chaotic confusion. So with a fervor of devout joy as when perhaps the old

1052
01:55:36.16 --> 01:55:42.64
crusaders first caught sight of the holy city of their quest with an uproaring of heart that was

1053
01:55:42.64 --> 01:55:50.40
half pagan half prayer we dash forward to the consummation a solitary field piece in the edge of

1054
01:55:50.40 --> 01:55:56.24
town gives an angry but expiring defiance we press down the little slope through a little swamp

1055
01:55:56.24 --> 01:56:02.56
over a bright swift stream our advances already in the town only the narrow street between

1056
01:56:02.56 --> 01:56:11.12
the posing lines and hardly that there is wild work that looks frightening but not much killing

1057
01:56:11.12 --> 01:56:18.32
nor even hurting the disheartened enemy take it easy our men take them easier

1058
01:56:18.32 --> 01:56:27.60
it is a wild mild fusing earnest but not deadly earnest a young orderly of mine unable to

1059
01:56:27.60 --> 01:56:33.52
contain himself begs permission to go forward and dashes in sword flourishing as if he was a

1060
01:56:33.52 --> 01:56:40.64
terrible fellow his demonstrations seemingly more amusing than resisted for he soon comes back

1061
01:56:40.64 --> 01:56:53.04
hugging four sabers to his breast speechless at his achievement new guy going in so you can see the

1062
01:56:53.04 --> 01:57:01.68
looking fetter army is kind of fallen apart and these guys are charging in expecting a fight and

1063
01:57:01.68 --> 01:57:10.24
there's just not that much of a fight and then this suddenly rose to our sight another form

1064
01:57:10.24 --> 01:57:17.44
closer on front a soldierly young figure handsomely dressed and mounted a confederate staff officer

1065
01:57:17.44 --> 01:57:26.56
undoubtedly to whom some of my advanced lines seem to be pointing my position now I see the white

1066
01:57:26.56 --> 01:57:34.48
flag earnestly born and it's possible purport sweeps before my inner vision like a rave of

1067
01:57:34.48 --> 01:57:42.32
morning mist he comes steadily on the mysterious forming gray my mood so whimsical sensitive

1068
01:57:42.32 --> 01:57:47.84
that I could even smile at the material of the flag wondering where in either army was found a

1069
01:57:47.84 --> 01:57:57.36
towel and one so white but it bore a mighty message that simple emblem of homely service

1070
01:57:57.36 --> 01:58:03.84
wafted hitherward above the dark and crimson streams that never can wash themselves away

1071
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.60
the messenger draws near dismounts with graceful salutation and hardly suppressed emotion

1072
01:58:11.60 --> 01:58:20.32
delivers his message sir I am from general Gordon general lead desires a cessation of hostilities

1073
01:58:20.32 --> 01:58:30.24
until he can hear from general grant as to the proposal of surrender what word is this so long

1074
01:58:30.24 --> 01:58:36.64
so dearly fought for so feverously dreamed but never but ever snatched away held hidden and eloof

1075
01:58:36.64 --> 01:58:44.000
now smiting the senses with dizzy flash surrender we had no rumor of this from the long

1076
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.84
messages that had been passing between grant lee for now these two days between behind us surrender

1077
01:58:51.04 --> 01:58:57.68
it takes a moment to gather one speech sir I answer that matter exceeds my authority

1078
01:58:58.80 --> 01:59:03.92
I will send to my superior general lead is right he can do no more

1079
01:59:05.76 --> 01:59:11.68
all this with a forced calmness covering a tumult of heart and brain

1080
01:59:11.68 --> 01:59:18.64
I bid him wait a while and the message goes up to my core commander general griffin leaving me

1081
01:59:19.84 --> 01:59:21.84
mazed at the boating change

1082
01:59:26.08 --> 01:59:30.80
even here he's trying to remain calm like purposely forced calmness

1083
01:59:33.52 --> 01:59:39.04
now from the right come foaming up in cavalry fashion two forms I had watched from a way beyond a white

1084
01:59:39.04 --> 01:59:44.16
flag again held strong a loft making straight for the little group beneath our battle flag

1085
01:59:44.16 --> 01:59:49.36
highborne also the red multi's cross on a white field that had thrilled hearts long ago

1086
01:59:50.64 --> 01:59:56.88
I see now that is one of our cavalry staff in the lead indeed I recognize him

1087
01:59:56.88 --> 02:00:02.56
chrono wittaker of custer staff and hardly keeping pace with him a Confederate staff officer

1088
02:00:02.56 --> 02:00:10.32
without dismounting without salutation the cavalry man shouts this is unconditional surrender

1089
02:00:10.32 --> 02:00:15.92
this is the end then he hastily introduces his companion and adds

1090
02:00:17.68 --> 02:00:24.48
I am just from Gordon and Long Street Gordon says for God's sake stop this infantry or

1091
02:00:25.28 --> 02:00:32.48
hell will be to pay I'll go to Sheridan he adds and dashes away with a white flag leaving

1092
02:00:32.48 --> 02:00:40.24
Long Street's aid with me the captain's cry hold the rebels want to surrender

1093
02:00:40.24 --> 02:00:45.12
the more men want to be there and see it still to the front where the real fun is

1094
02:00:47.28 --> 02:00:52.80
and the forward takes an upward turn for when we do succeed in stopping their advance we cannot keep

1095
02:00:52.80 --> 02:00:57.92
their arms and legs from flying to the top of fences and haystacks and chimneys they clamber

1096
02:00:57.92 --> 02:01:02.48
to toss their old caps higher in the air and leave the earth as far below as they can

1097
02:01:02.48 --> 02:01:07.60
deroll general Gregory Gallops up to inquire the meaning of this strange departure from a

1098
02:01:07.60 --> 02:01:14.64
custom discipline only that lee wants time to surrender I answer glory to God

1099
02:01:15.36 --> 02:01:20.48
roars the grave and brave old general your legs have done it my men he shouts

1100
02:01:22.40 --> 02:01:27.52
galloping up cap in hand generously for giving our disobedience of orders and rash exposure on the

1101
02:01:27.52 --> 02:01:33.20
dubious crest true enough their legs had done it had matched the cavalry as granted mid-it

1102
02:01:33.20 --> 02:01:39.36
had caught around lee's best doings and commanded the grand halt but other things had done it

1103
02:01:39.92 --> 02:01:46.80
the blood was still fresh upon the quaker road the white oak ridge five forks farmville high

1104
02:01:46.80 --> 02:01:52.56
bridge and sailors creek and we take somewhat gravely this compliment of our new commander

1105
02:01:52.56 --> 02:02:00.16
of the army of the james at last after pardoning something to the spirit of liberty we get things

1106
02:02:00.16 --> 02:02:14.40
quiet along the lines one the clock comes no answer from lee nothing for us but to shake hands and

1107
02:02:14.40 --> 02:02:20.24
take arms to resume hostilities as I turned to go general Griffin said to me in a low voice

1108
02:02:20.24 --> 02:02:25.84
prepared a make or receive an attack in ten minutes it was a sudden change in tone of

1109
02:02:25.84 --> 02:02:31.60
our relations and brought a queer sensation where my troops had halted the opposing lines

1110
02:02:31.60 --> 02:02:37.36
were in close proximity the men stacked arms the men had stacked arms and were resting in place

1111
02:02:38.08 --> 02:02:43.12
it did not seem like war we were going to recommends but willful murder

1112
02:02:43.12 --> 02:02:50.56
but the order was only to prepare and that we did our troop foreign good position my

1113
02:02:50.56 --> 02:02:56.88
advance line across the road and we stood fast and tensly waiting I had mounted and sat looking

1114
02:02:56.88 --> 02:03:01.92
at the scene before me thinking of all that was impending and depending when I felt it

1115
02:03:03.36 --> 02:03:11.12
coming upon a strange sense of some presence invisible but powerful like those unirfully

1116
02:03:11.12 --> 02:03:17.20
visits told of an ancient story charged with supernatural message disquieted I turned about

1117
02:03:18.32 --> 02:03:23.36
and there behind me riding in between my two lines appeared a commanding form

1118
02:03:23.36 --> 02:03:31.52
superbly mounted richly accrued accrued of imposing bearing noble countenance with expression of

1119
02:03:31.52 --> 02:03:41.04
deep sadness over mastered by deeper strength it is no other than Robert e.lee and seen by me

1120
02:03:41.04 --> 02:03:46.56
for the first time within my own lines I sat immovable with a certain awe and admiration

1121
02:03:47.76 --> 02:03:55.76
he was coming with a single staff officer for the great appointed meeting which was to determine

1122
02:03:55.76 --> 02:04:04.48
momentous issues not long after by another in leading road appeared another form plain

1123
02:04:04.48 --> 02:04:11.84
unassuming simple and familiar to our eyes but but to the thought as much inspiring as Lee in his

1124
02:04:11.84 --> 02:04:18.56
splendor and his sadness it is grant he too comes with a single aid a staff officer of shared in

1125
02:04:19.60 --> 02:04:27.28
slouched hat without cord common soldier blouse unbuttoned on which however the four stars

1126
02:04:27.28 --> 02:04:33.68
high boots mud splashed to the top trousers tucked inside no sword but the sword hand deep in the

1127
02:04:33.68 --> 02:04:40.16
pocket sitting his saddle with the ease of a born master taking no notice of anything at all all

1128
02:04:40.16 --> 02:04:46.48
his faculties gathered into intense thought and mighty calm he seemed greater than I'd ever seen him

1129
02:04:46.48 --> 02:04:54.80
a look of another world about him no wonder I forgot altogether to salute him anything like that

1130
02:04:54.80 --> 02:05:13.84
would have been to live a little staff officers are flying crying Lee surrenders

1131
02:05:15.12 --> 02:05:19.44
although with some kind of strength left among those worn and famished men

1132
02:05:19.44 --> 02:05:25.76
building the hills around the springs of apomattox who rent the air with shouting in uproar as

1133
02:05:25.76 --> 02:05:32.32
if the earth and see a join the song are men did what they thought their share and then went to sleep

1134
02:05:32.32 --> 02:05:37.44
as they had not as they had need to do but in the opposite camp they acted as if they got of

1135
02:05:37.44 --> 02:05:44.96
hold of something too good to keep and gave it to the stars besides they had supper that night

1136
02:05:44.96 --> 02:05:52.32
which was something of a novelty for we had divided rations with our old antagonist now they were

1137
02:05:52.32 --> 02:06:01.68
by our side as suffering brothers so they're well in truth long street had come over to our camp

1138
02:06:01.68 --> 02:06:09.36
that evening with an unwampton moisture on his martial cheek and compressed words on his lips

1139
02:06:09.36 --> 02:06:15.12
gentlemen I must speak plainly we are starving over there for god's sake can you send us something

1140
02:06:16.16 --> 02:06:23.12
we were men and we acted like men knowing we should suffer it for ourselves we were too short

1141
02:06:23.12 --> 02:06:28.64
rationed also and had been for days but must be for days to come

1142
02:06:28.64 --> 02:06:39.36
we sent over to that starving camp share and share alike for all their with ourselves

1143
02:06:41.92 --> 02:06:49.36
again that's like amazing to the sort of mutual respect almost instantly to try and help out these

1144
02:06:50.80 --> 02:06:56.64
your enemy how about long streets coming over by you're not sending a staff officer or anybody else

1145
02:06:56.64 --> 02:07:07.68
he's going to say hey bring my guy some food so there's some forgiveness this was also

1146
02:07:07.68 --> 02:07:12.56
interesting late that night I was summoned to headquarters where general Griffin informed me

1147
02:07:12.56 --> 02:07:17.60
that I was to command the parade on the occasion of the formal surrender of the arms and colors of

1148
02:07:17.60 --> 02:07:24.96
Lee's army he said the Confederates had begged hard to be allowed to stack their arms on the ground

1149
02:07:24.96 --> 02:07:31.60
where they were and let us go pick them up after they had gone so that was their plan the

1150
02:07:31.60 --> 02:07:37.12
Confederates said hey let us just leave our weapons and we're gonna bail but granted not think this

1151
02:07:37.12 --> 02:07:42.16
quite respectful enough to anybody including the United States of America and while he would have

1152
02:07:42.16 --> 02:07:47.76
all private property respected and would permit officers to retain their side arms he insisted

1153
02:07:47.76 --> 02:07:54.40
that surrender that the surrendering army as such should march out in due order and lay down

1154
02:07:54.40 --> 02:08:00.32
all tokens of Confederate authority and organized hostility to the United States in an immediate

1155
02:08:00.32 --> 02:08:06.88
presence of some representative portion of the Union army Griffin added in a significant tone

1156
02:08:06.88 --> 02:08:11.76
that grant wish to the ceremony to be as simple as possible and that nothing should be done to

1157
02:08:11.76 --> 02:08:23.20
humiliate the manhood of the Southern soldiers so there's like a little balance there okay we'll

1158
02:08:23.20 --> 02:08:28.08
share some food with you but you got to come and you got to come and surrender proper

1159
02:08:32.16 --> 02:08:38.08
it was now the morning of the 12th of April I had been ordered to have my lines formed for the

1160
02:08:38.08 --> 02:08:44.32
ceremony at sunrise it was at chill gray morning depressing to the senses we formed along the principal

1161
02:08:44.32 --> 02:08:54.48
street we were the remnants also Massachusetts main Maryland Michigan Pennsylvania New York

1162
02:08:54.48 --> 02:09:02.16
Veterans and Replace Veterans cut to pieces cut down consolidated divisions into brigades

1163
02:09:02.16 --> 02:09:09.04
regiments into one gather by state origin back to their place of birth this little line

1164
02:09:09.04 --> 02:09:19.12
quintit quintessence a metasite coasts of porters old core of gains mill of maveran hill

1165
02:09:19.76 --> 02:09:30.08
man of near blood borne made near by blood shed those facing us now thank God the same

1166
02:09:30.08 --> 02:09:39.68
our earnest eyes can scan the busy groups on the opposite slopes breaking camp for the last time

1167
02:09:40.56 --> 02:09:45.52
taking down the little shelter tents and folding them carefully as precious things then

1168
02:09:45.52 --> 02:09:53.36
slowly forming ranks as for unwelcome duty and now they move the dusky storms forge forward into

1169
02:09:53.36 --> 02:10:00.64
gray columns of march on they come with the old swinging root step and swaying battle flags

1170
02:10:04.32 --> 02:10:10.32
instructions had been given and when the head of each division column comes opposite our camp

1171
02:10:10.32 --> 02:10:16.80
our bugle sounds the signal and instantly our whole line from right to left regiment by regiment in

1172
02:10:16.80 --> 02:10:24.56
succession gives the soldiers' sallutation from the order arms to the old carry the marching salute

1173
02:10:26.24 --> 02:10:31.84
Gordon at the head of the column writing with heavy spirit and downcast face catches the sound of

1174
02:10:31.84 --> 02:10:37.92
shifting arms looks up and taking the meaning wheels superbly making himself in his horse one

1175
02:10:37.92 --> 02:10:44.56
uplifted figure with the proud profound sallutation as he drops the point of his sword to the boot toe

1176
02:10:44.56 --> 02:10:51.28
then facing to his own command gives word for successive brigades to pass us with the same position

1177
02:10:51.28 --> 02:11:00.40
of manual honor answering for honor our part on our part not a sound of trumpet

1178
02:11:01.44 --> 02:11:08.72
nor role of drum not a cheer nor word of whisper of vain gloring nor motion of a man standing

1179
02:11:08.72 --> 02:11:16.000
again at the order but an odd stillness rather and breath holding as if it were the passing of the dead

1180
02:11:19.68 --> 02:11:27.92
they fix bayonets stack arms then hesitantly remove cartridge boxes and lay them down

1181
02:11:29.60 --> 02:11:37.44
lastly reluctantly with agony of expression they tenderly fold their flags battle worn in

1182
02:11:37.44 --> 02:11:45.12
torn blood stained heart-holding colors and lay them down some friends at the rushing from the

1183
02:11:45.12 --> 02:11:49.92
ranks kneeling over them clinging to them pressing them to their lips with burning tears

1184
02:11:52.24 --> 02:11:54.72
and only the flag of the union greets the sky

1185
02:11:58.96 --> 02:12:04.96
what visions thronged as we looked into each other's eyes here past the man of antitum the bloody

1186
02:12:04.96 --> 02:12:10.96
lane the sunken road the cornfield the burn-side bridge the men whom stone wall Jackson on the second

1187
02:12:10.96 --> 02:12:15.84
night at Frederick's bird banged lee to let him take and crush the two core of the army of the

1188
02:12:15.84 --> 02:12:22.08
petomic huddled in the streets in the darkness and confusion the men who swept the eleventh core

1189
02:12:22.08 --> 02:12:27.84
at chancellorville who left 6,000 of their companions around the bases of colps and cemetery hills

1190
02:12:27.84 --> 02:12:33.44
at getty's burg these survivors of the terrible wilderness the bloody angle at spotsylvania

1191
02:12:33.44 --> 02:12:40.72
the slaughter pen of cold harbor the whirlpool of Bethesda church here comes cobs George

1192
02:12:40.72 --> 02:12:48.56
Elegion which held the stone wall on Mary's heights at Frederick'sburg close before which we

1193
02:12:48.56 --> 02:12:56.96
piled our dead for breastwork so that the living might stay alive here to come Gordon's Georgians

1194
02:12:56.96 --> 02:13:02.40
and hoax north Carolinians who stood before the terrific mine explosion at Peter'sburg

1195
02:13:02.40 --> 02:13:09.12
and advancing retook the smoking crater and the dismal heaps of dead ours more than theirs

1196
02:13:09.12 --> 02:13:15.44
huddled in the ghastly chasm here are the men of megalons honten and scales who broke the fifth

1197
02:13:15.44 --> 02:13:20.16
core lines on the white oak road and were so desperately driven back on that four-learn night

1198
02:13:20.16 --> 02:13:28.32
of march the 31st by thrice decimated brigade now comes Anderson's fourth core

1199
02:13:28.32 --> 02:13:36.80
only bush rod and bush rod that johnson's division left and this the remnant of those we

1200
02:13:36.80 --> 02:13:43.04
fought so fiercely on quaker road two weeks ago with wise his legion two fears for its own good

1201
02:13:45.04 --> 02:13:50.000
here passes the proud remnant of rambson's north ransom's north Carolinians

1202
02:13:50.72 --> 02:13:57.28
who were swept through five forks ten days ago and all the little that was left of this division

1203
02:13:57.28 --> 02:14:05.12
in the sharp passages at sailors creek five days thereafter now makes its last front

1204
02:14:05.84 --> 02:14:11.84
ap hills old core half now at the leads until had gone too far forward ever to return

1205
02:14:13.44 --> 02:14:19.12
the men who poured destruction into our division at shepherd's town forward and tedom in 62

1206
02:14:19.12 --> 02:14:25.20
when hill reported the atomic the patemic running blue with our bodies the men who opened the

1207
02:14:25.20 --> 02:14:31.84
desperate first days fight at getty'sburg wherewithstanding them so stubbornly our

1208
02:14:31.84 --> 02:14:37.28
Robinson's brigade lost one thousand one hundred eighty five men and the iron brigade alone

1209
02:14:37.28 --> 02:14:43.68
one thousand one hundred and fifty three these men of half division here two losing two thousand

1210
02:14:43.68 --> 02:14:48.88
eight hundred and fifty men companions of these now looking into our faces so differently

1211
02:14:48.88 --> 02:14:58.88
now the sad great pageant long street in his men what shall we give them for greeting that has not

1212
02:14:58.88 --> 02:15:04.16
already been spoken in valleys of thunder and written in lines of fire all over the banks of Virginia

1213
02:15:05.92 --> 02:15:13.28
shall we go back to gains mill or maveran hill or to antitum of Maryland or get his

1214
02:15:13.28 --> 02:15:20.32
berg of Pennsylvania deepest grave and a wall for here is what remains of kursha's division

1215
02:15:21.36 --> 02:15:26.96
which left forty percent of its men at antitum and at getty'sberg with barksdale and stems

1216
02:15:26.96 --> 02:15:33.60
brigade tore through the peach orchard rolling up our rolling up the right of our gallant third

1217
02:15:33.60 --> 02:15:39.84
core sweeping over the proud batteries of mass attuces big allow and philips we are under the smoke

1218
02:15:39.84 --> 02:15:46.40
we saw earth brown and blue with prostrated bodies of men and horses and the tongues of overturned

1219
02:15:46.40 --> 02:15:55.68
cannon pointing grim and stark in the air then in the wilderness and at spots of

1220
02:15:55.68 --> 02:16:03.60
vignor kursha again in deeds of awful glory and thereafter for all their losses holding their name

1221
02:16:03.60 --> 02:16:10.56
and fame until fate met them at sailors creek where all but these with kursha himself and

1222
02:16:10.56 --> 02:16:19.52
it will you and so many more gave up their arms and hopes all indeed but manhood's honor

1223
02:16:22.72 --> 02:16:27.84
with what strange emotion I looked into these faces before which in the mad assault river

1224
02:16:27.84 --> 02:16:34.16
on reefs say we at June 1864 I was left for dead under their eyes

1225
02:16:36.56 --> 02:16:40.80
it is by miracles we have lived to see this day any of us standing here

1226
02:16:45.20 --> 02:16:51.20
now comes the sinew we remnant of fierce hoods division which at getty'sberg we saw pouring

1227
02:16:51.20 --> 02:16:57.92
through the devil's den and plumb run gorge turning again by the left our stubborn third core

1228
02:16:57.92 --> 02:17:03.84
then swarming up the rocky bastions of roundtop to be met there by equal valor which changed

1229
02:17:03.84 --> 02:17:10.80
leaves whole plan of battle and perhaps the story of getty'sberg is this picket's division

1230
02:17:12.16 --> 02:17:17.12
this little group left of those who on the lured last day of getty'sberg

1231
02:17:17.12 --> 02:17:23.52
rested level crossfire and thunder bolts of storm to be strewn back drifting wrecks

1232
02:17:23.52 --> 02:17:31.44
where after that awful futile pitiful charge we buried them in graves of furlong wide with names unknown

1233
02:17:31.44 --> 02:17:47.36
man again in the terrible cyclone sweep over the breastworks at five forks met now so thin

1234
02:17:47.36 --> 02:17:56.08
so pale purged of the mortal as if knowing pain or joy no more how could we help falling on our

1235
02:17:56.08 --> 02:18:05.20
knees all of us together and praying God to pity and forgive us all

1236
02:18:26.08 --> 02:18:30.56
you know i don't know if you can capture the emotions that these guys must have felt on both sides

1237
02:18:30.56 --> 02:18:36.80
at this juncture but i must be a pretty close proximity to at least the best you could do to capture

1238
02:18:36.80 --> 02:18:51.60
those emotions and there's another the book goes on and there's a powerful section where

1239
02:18:51.60 --> 02:18:57.60
he because that that section there you know he kind of calls out name by name with the various

1240
02:18:57.60 --> 02:19:04.16
units and there's a section where there's a parade for the army of the platomic and it's incredible

1241
02:19:04.16 --> 02:19:13.44
pop incredibly powerful as well and he goes by unit by unit um there's one point where he brings up

1242
02:19:13.44 --> 02:19:20.40
the fact that while Warren was Warren there was a there was basically a trial because Warren said

1243
02:19:20.40 --> 02:19:25.44
hey I shouldn't have been fired he wanted to kind of redeem himself and there's he brings up a

1244
02:19:25.44 --> 02:19:31.76
point where someone was asking one of the one of the cross-examining lawyers asked Warren hey

1245
02:19:31.76 --> 02:19:37.84
when you're in this battle where where were your regulars and Warren looks at him with a bold and

1246
02:19:37.84 --> 02:19:50.56
quivering lip and says buried sir agettiesburg and yeah that's it's it's hard to do this book

1247
02:19:50.56 --> 02:19:58.80
justice without just reading the entire thing and there's just stories upon stories in in this book

1248
02:19:58.80 --> 02:20:08.72
and lessons so many lessons that we we barely touched into like I said before if you get a

1249
02:20:08.72 --> 02:20:16.88
chance to go to get his bird go there go there we go there if you want to come there with us go check that out

1250
02:20:16.88 --> 02:20:23.52
but there's a one more section that I wanted to cover in the book

1251
02:20:23.52 --> 02:20:37.60
Joshua Chamberlain is he's he's with some of his surviving troops in Maine and there've been

1252
02:20:37.60 --> 02:20:42.24
some kind of scrambling of of the organization the 20th May to become combined with the 16th

1253
02:20:42.24 --> 02:20:48.88
and the second and the wars finished and I tried to figure out how long after the war this was

1254
02:20:48.88 --> 02:20:55.52
so I could not I couldn't quite identify when exactly this was but they're at a banquet and

1255
02:20:55.52 --> 02:21:01.52
Chamberlain you know this whole both these podcasts we were talking about the flags and the meaning

1256
02:21:01.52 --> 02:21:07.76
of this colors right what they meant what they represented and during the defense of little

1257
02:21:07.76 --> 02:21:14.48
roundtop at some point they had lost their colors at some point you know during this freaking

1258
02:21:14.48 --> 02:21:24.32
mayhem they lost their colors and it you know this is a symbolic event like I said like he was

1259
02:21:24.32 --> 02:21:30.16
saying it's a tactical event there there's actually a tactical reason for those colors but it's also

1260
02:21:30.16 --> 02:21:39.68
symbolic as well and at some point these during the battle of Gettysburg and I'm not exactly sure

1261
02:21:39.68 --> 02:21:44.24
when it was I don't even know if it's during roundtop that defense but at some point the soldiers from

1262
02:21:44.24 --> 02:21:49.68
main the colors were lost for a little while and Chamberlain wants to address that directly

1263
02:21:50.40 --> 02:21:56.88
to the surviving troops in this in this speech and I just want to read one section of it

1264
02:22:00.80 --> 02:22:12.16
he says your colors it was said were lost that word came to me when on the morning of the second

1265
02:22:12.16 --> 02:22:19.52
I reached the crest far to the rear of that where you had stood and I felt the shock but not of shame

1266
02:22:21.20 --> 02:22:28.32
for I knew something terrible must have befallen and that there could have been no dishonor where you were

1267
02:22:30.32 --> 02:22:36.24
but when I came to know the truth of it all I saw that instead of your colors being lost they were

1268
02:22:36.24 --> 02:22:47.60
eternally saved not laid down but lifted up not captured nor surrendered but translated the shadow

1269
02:22:47.60 --> 02:22:55.52
lost in substance the flag it is the symbol of the country's honor power law and life

1270
02:22:56.64 --> 02:23:04.08
it is the instant of loyalty the bond of brotherhood for those who stand under it a token and an inspiration

1271
02:23:04.08 --> 02:23:12.40
hence it is held sacred by the soldier as in great moments it is also by the citizen

1272
02:23:14.88 --> 02:23:23.76
all which that flag symbolized you had illustrated and impersonated had absorbed into your thoughts and

1273
02:23:23.76 --> 02:23:34.32
hearts if I should not rather say itself had absorbed your thoughts and hearts your service and suffering

1274
02:23:34.32 --> 02:23:46.64
into its own deeper meaning and dear honor now it had done all a simple could do you had stood for it all

1275
02:23:46.64 --> 02:23:54.72
now the supreme moment had come nothing could be averted nothing could be resisted nothing could be

1276
02:23:54.72 --> 02:24:05.04
escaped that was an awful moment passing that of death it seems to me then a new soul is born

1277
02:24:06.40 --> 02:24:12.80
no thought of yielding up the token of the country's honor enters the heart of any one of you

1278
02:24:12.80 --> 02:24:21.20
though it has fulfilled its ends though you are to go to prison and death your kernel

1279
02:24:22.08 --> 02:24:28.48
common don'tless commander still bids you break the staff that had borne it aloft and tear that

1280
02:24:28.48 --> 02:24:34.72
symbol single as your souls into many pieces as you had bosoms and shelter them with your lives

1281
02:24:34.72 --> 02:24:48.16
less that flag be touched by hostile hand or triumphed over living man lost there is a way of

1282
02:24:48.16 --> 02:24:58.24
losing that is finding when soul over master's sense when the noble and divine self

1283
02:24:58.24 --> 02:25:06.96
over comes the lower self when duty and honor and love immortal things bid the mortal perish

1284
02:25:08.72 --> 02:25:19.52
it is only when a man supremely gives that he supremely finds that was your sacrifice

1285
02:25:19.52 --> 02:25:28.000
that is your reward

1286
02:25:39.44 --> 02:25:45.76
when we talked about the surrender it was him describing it and you know later parts of the books

1287
02:25:45.76 --> 02:25:53.92
you find out that that salute that they gave to the Confederates they weren't ordered to do that

1288
02:25:53.92 --> 02:26:00.48
he just straight up did that out of shivalry and then as the Confederates are coming past

1289
02:26:00.88 --> 02:26:06.56
and they think that they're like oh man you know their heads are down and they see that you know

1290
02:26:07.12 --> 02:26:11.52
they think the union armies are making fun of them or laughing at them or scoffing at them

1291
02:26:11.52 --> 02:26:22.40
and they receive that salute and they give the salute back to it's just incredible incredible

1292
02:26:22.40 --> 02:26:39.60
description yeah yeah it's um I don't know what else I can do do the audio book I think at some

1293
02:26:39.60 --> 02:26:44.96
point this freaking sit here and read this whole thing you're best main accent yeah my best main accent

1294
02:26:44.96 --> 02:26:50.64
I'll also work I apologize that sometimes I pronounce words wrong and I'm sorry

1295
02:26:51.84 --> 02:26:56.64
I'm just kind of reading it and I don't feel like doing nine takes to say words that I can't say

1296
02:26:56.64 --> 02:27:03.60
very well so I apologize about that that I don't do that justice but so many lessons in this book

1297
02:27:03.60 --> 02:27:10.96
just about how to be a good human being and I still I know we just did two podcasts on them on it

1298
02:27:10.96 --> 02:27:16.80
but it's there's so much in there this guy is such an incredible example the way he lived

1299
02:27:17.52 --> 02:27:26.80
the things he did his attitude and really you know some some people talk about the divisiveness

1300
02:27:26.80 --> 02:27:33.20
you know in America right now and you know you hear people say oh it's never been this bad

1301
02:27:33.20 --> 02:27:37.84
before well you know what it has it's been freaking infinitely worse infinitely worse

1302
02:27:39.84 --> 02:27:46.32
and the fact that you could go through a divisiveness so incredibly

1303
02:27:48.72 --> 02:27:54.96
incredibly violent I mean this is our war we just just it was a slaughter

1304
02:27:56.16 --> 02:28:01.36
just think about that last podcast the things that the description he's giving on those battlefields

1305
02:28:01.36 --> 02:28:11.68
but if we as a nation can go through that that insane violence and at the end of that

1306
02:28:12.80 --> 02:28:21.28
at the end of that at the end of killing each other whole sale slaughtering each other at the end of that

1307
02:28:22.72 --> 02:28:29.68
the very men that that fought each other that killed each other those very men

1308
02:28:29.68 --> 02:28:44.40
can stand and salute each other and respect each other and decide that we should stay a union

1309
02:28:46.40 --> 02:28:57.20
if we as a country can get through that then I only can hope that we can move past

1310
02:28:57.20 --> 02:29:10.48
some of the bickering that we have today and hold up this flag and unify all of us together

1311
02:29:11.84 --> 02:29:15.52
to continue to provide a place in the world

1312
02:29:18.40 --> 02:29:19.52
with freedom

1313
02:29:19.52 --> 02:29:23.84

1325
02:30:46.96 --> 02:30:54.32
greedy to be because the old school big confessions are you actually the small thing I thought

1326
02:30:54.32 --> 02:30:59.04
it's not not quite as serious but I will say this so you know it's what is it about

1327
02:30:59.04 --> 02:31:05.12
when you have like enemies or even people who just don't like each other and they're in the

1328
02:31:05.12 --> 02:31:10.08
one the any form of like enemy and then they go through like all this like ups and downs and they fight

1329
02:31:10.08 --> 02:31:15.92
each other and and then at the end like they become friends or whatever maybe reconcile and they

1330
02:31:15.92 --> 02:31:20.24
become friends but what is it about that that makes everyone feel so good afterwards

1331
02:31:21.44 --> 02:31:26.40
I would say part of it is the shared struggle right we've been through some shit I've been through

1332
02:31:26.40 --> 02:31:33.60
some shit okay like there's a shared struggle even if we're not opposing it I mean you think of a

1333
02:31:33.60 --> 02:31:38.40
football game right you play a good game against someone and it's a scrap and you're throwing down

1334
02:31:38.40 --> 02:31:44.88
that's muddy and it's close like when you say good game to that person you mean it right you mean it

1335
02:31:45.84 --> 02:31:50.24
so I think that shared struggle and then you know like part of it it's got to be like thank God this

1336
02:31:50.24 --> 02:31:55.28
is over you know I got that feeling from the southern soldiers that they were like thank God this is

1337
02:31:55.28 --> 02:32:04.88
over like I'm done and I mean there's an opportunity for redemption right when when you're fighting

1338
02:32:04.88 --> 02:32:09.92
someone in their enemy and then at the end of it we're like hey we're not enemies anymore

1339
02:32:11.52 --> 02:32:17.36
there's the redemption there's an end to it because if we keep holding that animosity it never ends

1340
02:32:18.56 --> 02:32:23.04
and there's no there's no healing there's nothing else like that and so like you know you didn't

1341
02:32:23.04 --> 02:32:29.04
cover it but like there's what you did where they're sharing their meals but they were they were

1342
02:32:29.04 --> 02:32:35.52
trading stuff for like there was like an intermingling there for a couple hours where they were trading

1343
02:32:35.52 --> 02:32:41.04
souvenirs with one another and that's incredible when you're talking about men that and a couple

1344
02:32:41.04 --> 02:32:47.52
hours before that had walked all freaking night and part of the day to kill one another and now they're

1345
02:32:47.52 --> 02:32:52.32
just like yeah over done yeah and by the way they just killed each other a week before that and a month

1346
02:32:52.32 --> 02:32:59.52
before that and six months before that you know this is just a bloody bloody awful awful war

1347
02:32:59.52 --> 02:33:05.44
it's so it's like the Christmas story in World War One yeah it's an indicator that we're not

1348
02:33:06.64 --> 02:33:12.72
bad yeah it's one of those things where these these these you know great things happens in

1349
02:33:12.72 --> 02:33:19.28
indicates that we're just we're not I sure we're flawed as human beings but we're not flawed beyond

1350
02:33:19.28 --> 02:33:26.96
redemption and I think the the thing that I get out of like the Christmas truths and this ceremony

1351
02:33:26.96 --> 02:33:32.64
here at the end is it's just that not there not even I don't I don't know for not bad or not

1352
02:33:32.64 --> 02:33:38.000
I definitely indicates that we're not right it indicates but also it indicates to me that

1353
02:33:38.64 --> 02:33:45.44
we all have way more in common than we have not in common and like when you get to the point

1354
02:33:45.44 --> 02:33:53.76
at the end of the day Jason Gardner has to eat has to shit has to make money has to feed his

1355
02:33:53.76 --> 02:34:01.28
family has to help out with you know what you're doing in the world and I'm over here I have to eat

1356
02:34:01.28 --> 02:34:07.36
I have to shit I have to take care of my family and I want my kids to have a good life and you

1357
02:34:07.36 --> 02:34:12.08
want your kids to have a good life and I don't want you know I want to have some kind of

1358
02:34:12.08 --> 02:34:18.24
stability in my life and you want to have some kind of stability in your life and so we we have so much

1359
02:34:18.24 --> 02:34:26.08
in common and we let things that are sort of oftentimes if you put them in a bigger picture totally

1360
02:34:26.08 --> 02:34:30.88
irrelevant I mean that's what was shocking about the brits and the Germans having a freak

1361
02:34:30.88 --> 02:34:40.72
up playing soccer is like those guys didn't give a shit what was going on with some freaking king somewhere

1362
02:34:42.32 --> 02:34:49.04
they didn't care what I why do I care about this land over here in France I live in Germany bro

1363
02:34:49.60 --> 02:34:55.76
you live in England like I don't care the French people live here let them live here what are we doing

1364
02:34:55.76 --> 02:35:07.68
so we get wrapped around some dumb shit and you know in this case it's definitely a very

1365
02:35:07.68 --> 02:35:17.76
distinct reason for fighting and the union had to go through this turmoil to read itself of

1366
02:35:18.56 --> 02:35:23.76
slavery had to go through it there was no other way it wasn't gonna it wasn't gonna go easy you had to do

1367
02:35:23.76 --> 02:35:35.12
this kind of massive war to get to get through that but we did and now we can go get stuff from

1368
02:35:35.12 --> 02:35:41.44
origin us a calm yeah you're supposed to come in and like help I'm supposed to say some shit like

1369
02:35:41.44 --> 02:35:48.40
got to like make me calm power over here as a rough transition but I think it is like it's like

1370
02:35:48.40 --> 02:35:56.08
like after you fight for so long it's almost like you lose you almost forget kind of like these

1371
02:35:56.08 --> 02:36:01.60
men like minimal things that or evidently minimal things that you're quote unquote fighting

1372
02:36:01.60 --> 02:36:05.84
for and you start remembering all the commonality stuff and then you start to get kind of exhausted

1373
02:36:05.84 --> 02:36:12.08
in a way where you're like just like I said like what are we doing like you kind of forget

1374
02:36:12.08 --> 02:36:16.24
what you're fighting for you just so habitually caught up in the fight and then finally when you

1375
02:36:16.24 --> 02:36:19.60
it's almost like you kind of snap to and be like wait a second like we're fighting over something

1376
02:36:19.60 --> 02:36:24.48
super small but meanwhile we have all these commonalities that are so big and then it's like a fight

1377
02:36:24.48 --> 02:36:29.68
it's like a relief you know and I think even when you engage in a battle what do you call it

1378
02:36:29.68 --> 02:36:33.20
went to other people battle and you're just witnessing it and you see them battling your taking

1379
02:36:33.20 --> 02:36:37.60
this guy side did you take in this guy side or whatever and then they finally make up you kind of feel

1380
02:36:37.60 --> 02:36:43.36
good too for some reason like you're ever seen like a rivalry and between some people it like feels kind

1381
02:36:43.36 --> 02:36:49.60
of good yeah yeah I sometimes I've got to ask a couple times like do I what I want to go back

1382
02:36:49.60 --> 02:36:55.44
to Iraq and like and I not there yet at all I'm not like hey you're gonna check it out check

1383
02:36:55.44 --> 02:37:00.88
the battlefield and the Ramadi look it go look at Baghdad look I'm not there I don't have any desire

1384
02:37:00.88 --> 02:37:07.04
to do that I don't know if I'll get there Ramadi says like rubble anyway they're not rebuilding

1385
02:37:07.04 --> 02:37:13.76
it at all but I think when liberating it from ISIS didn't yeah I saw those videos it was freaking

1386
02:37:14.96 --> 02:37:23.76
rubble house by house like oh there might be bad guys never new kit yeah yeah

1387
02:37:26.16 --> 02:37:32.40
I don't know you when you had a holly macke on and she talked about afghanistan falling

1388
02:37:32.40 --> 02:37:38.64
and then you know the story about the two the Taliban guys who slept outside of her hotel room

1389
02:37:38.64 --> 02:37:47.92
because they were they wanted to protect her so even there are enemy and and and you can see

1390
02:37:47.92 --> 02:37:52.40
your enemies acting was with honor and I think that was definitely honor because I didn't think

1391
02:37:52.40 --> 02:37:55.68
that was gonna work out that well for when I heard that story I'm like how did you even make

1392
02:37:55.68 --> 02:37:59.84
it back I know and then when she was over there was like hmm might be a good time to leave might be good

1393
02:37:59.84 --> 02:38:03.04
like you're not gonna be able to leave now you know you know you should probably leave you should

1394
02:38:03.04 --> 02:38:07.52
probably leave oh you're not gonna be able to get out there and she got out of there for she's a brave woman

1395
02:38:10.56 --> 02:38:15.36
I asked her like do you think you maybe you're a little bit of a heapsy like yeah maybe you know

1396
02:38:15.36 --> 02:38:21.20
I wouldn't be rolling around in there maybe I'm too paranoid maybe I'm too risk of verse

1397
02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:28.48
wait you just see one to many videos yeah yeah I'm still you know they weren't supposed to be

1398
02:38:28.48 --> 02:38:38.88
in just like uh god um all right what else echo speaking of videos or genus a you got some cool videos

1399
02:38:38.88 --> 02:38:44.64
there you two true if you're interested you can see how all the American made stuff is made

1400
02:38:44.64 --> 02:38:51.44
including jockel few by the way yep and guess what we at origin main have unified

1401
02:38:52.24 --> 02:38:57.52
the north and the south we have uh we have factories up in Maine we have factories in North Carolina

1402
02:38:57.52 --> 02:39:04.24
yes we're all the same team the American team the healing is continues the healing continues

1403
02:39:05.44 --> 02:39:08.88
I haven't been down to the north Carolina factory I'm looking forward to getting down there and meeting

1404
02:39:08.88 --> 02:39:16.000
everyone I got some roots in North Carolina and you know like I obviously have the root the new

1405
02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:23.28
England roots the wingland uh who's your roots uh just on the uh on my mom's side yeah I was born there

1406
02:39:23.28 --> 02:39:30.24
I got some roots in South Carolina you do you do yeah beautiful skate true story yeah you you you're

1407
02:39:30.24 --> 02:39:38.24
you're a straight up uh uh descendant of slaves correct from South Carolina yeah that uh

1408
02:39:39.44 --> 02:39:45.68
at the end of the civil war about 10% of the union army was

1409
02:39:45.68 --> 02:39:55.44
former slaves that had escaped to the north and if you think about that number 10% of the union

1410
02:39:55.44 --> 02:40:03.44
army that means basically every able bodied former slave man straight up just went and fought

1411
02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:12.64
free human legit that's free human legit um yeah speaking of legit look okay we'll talk about some

1412
02:40:12.64 --> 02:40:17.44
energy drinks legitimate not illegitimate because that's a stigma that energy drinks you

1413
02:40:17.44 --> 02:40:23.12
staff don't have that anymore talk go go healthy energy drink Jason you know about this I heard

1414
02:40:23.12 --> 02:40:30.48
you hear me um also a lot of other good supplements uh again while American made stuff yeah

1415
02:40:30.48 --> 02:40:36.24
good stuff let's go to jockelfuel dot com got some taste good protein got some uh joint health stuff

1416
02:40:36.24 --> 02:40:41.68
I'm I'm and you kind of need a bulk right out to be honest yeah well you get you get

1417
02:40:41.68 --> 02:40:46.96
top you get I don't know what the word is because last time we talked about jjitsu post jjitsu fatigue

1418
02:40:46.96 --> 02:40:54.16
sets in right hour and a half after jjitsu tired you leave jjitsu wired kind of like

1419
02:40:54.16 --> 02:41:00.24
amped high up but time you get home if you get home and then you eat you're going into some

1420
02:41:00.24 --> 02:41:05.44
series like sleep well same thing with a podcast like I get done with a podcast I'm super freaking

1421
02:41:05.44 --> 02:41:10.48
hype for like an hour and a half oh yeah maybe two hours and then all of us know it's not an

1422
02:41:10.48 --> 02:41:14.80
it's not two hours I got like an hour and a half of energy I'll usually try and go home and start

1423
02:41:14.80 --> 02:41:19.92
prepping my next podcast because I know I have energy that I need to do something with but then

1424
02:41:20.80 --> 02:41:28.16
it's mentally taxing to think and read and react and you're so like deep into it

1425
02:41:28.80 --> 02:41:33.92
and you're getting emotional I'm freaking get emotional reading and freaking book today right like

1426
02:41:34.72 --> 02:41:40.24
that's all happening what does that mean is if I'm getting emotional reading a book

1427
02:41:40.24 --> 02:41:45.92
is that taking the same emotional toll or having the same emotional impact as it is if I

1428
02:41:46.96 --> 02:41:53.36
watch a movie is it the same as if it if I have like something happened in my life what's the

1429
02:41:53.36 --> 02:41:57.04
difference probably the movie is probably similar not in life because life kind of like the

1430
02:41:57.04 --> 02:42:01.68
emotional part of life kind of continues right because your life is actually kind of okay the movie

1431
02:42:01.68 --> 02:42:07.12
ends and you're like cool story book I mean even though this one's true it's like okay that story is

1432
02:42:07.12 --> 02:42:14.16
kind of done so yeah but like there's an emotion of pride that I feel when I hear these stories that

1433
02:42:14.72 --> 02:42:19.76
again when I when I see my kid like doing something or something or something then I'm proud for them

1434
02:42:19.76 --> 02:42:24.88
it's kind of it's almost the same experience but it is the shorter burn for sure yeah first well

1435
02:42:24.88 --> 02:42:29.68
they you know this it's like this is always gonna be the case this happened no matter what happens

1436
02:42:29.68 --> 02:42:33.60
from not you know kind of thing but when you read the book it kind of calls your attention to it you

1437
02:42:33.60 --> 02:42:38.80
know and that's what's gonna invoke easy motion same thing with the movie but when I read this book or

1438
02:42:38.80 --> 02:42:46.80
books like this I'm having the emotions that I'm feeling are probably one third the motion from

1439
02:42:46.80 --> 02:42:52.96
the book and two third emotion of my own memories yeah and that's all movies are too right like

1440
02:42:52.96 --> 02:42:58.16
the like I get them like I think about these situations that unfolded and I'm thinking about

1441
02:42:58.16 --> 02:43:02.48
situations that unfolded for me obviously not to the degree of but

1442
02:43:02.48 --> 02:43:12.40
you know like you can't help thinking about that stuff and so even though it it it comes quick

1443
02:43:12.40 --> 02:43:18.16
and then you can close the book and it's over but you still were in there yeah so I'll be

1444
02:43:18.16 --> 02:43:23.60
freaking sleep like a baby tonight after your milkshake yeah after half the time that's what I was saying

1445
02:43:23.60 --> 02:43:31.20
because the milkshake also just stimulates like a form of the pleasure centers and of

1446
02:43:31.20 --> 02:43:38.96
of of of of safety and of comfort yeah you know you have a mole you're kind of like

1447
02:43:38.96 --> 02:43:44.80
bro it's all good you know the world's good it kind of kind of takes you to a psychological

02:43:44.80 --> 02:43:50.64
area where things are good like there's no you're not storming up a blood soaked

1449
02:43:50.64 --> 02:43:57.04
hill and drinking a mole those are the opposite of the spectrum so I'll go have a mole

02:48:16.56 --> 02:48:23.84
Russian roulette with the algorithm we're like dodgeball to be a dodgeball you can you know

1493
02:48:23.84 --> 02:48:28.24
some fun with it for sure but yeah you get the if that thing gets a head of you get caught up in

1494
02:48:28.24 --> 02:48:33.92
us they're not letting that happen in china by the way because their kids aren't allowed to be on

1495
02:48:33.92 --> 02:48:38.08
after such and such a time and the things that they're allowed to look at are controlled by the

1496
02:48:38.08 --> 02:48:47.52
state now I don't support controlling things by the state certainly but if you don't pay attention

1497
02:48:47.52 --> 02:48:56.72
you can waste 45 minutes on social media. You wind up you're like hey what is my thumb doing?

1498
02:48:56.72 --> 02:49:02.96
Why did it just go right there hit instagram and now I'm sweeping past I'm like oh stop it.

1499
02:49:02.96 --> 02:49:08.48
Yeah that's the algorithm's got to do it. The echo's trying to defend the algorithm.

1500
02:49:08.48 --> 02:49:15.36
The algorithm is like fire. You're right. It's okay. You can use it if you use it in a controlled way

1501
02:49:15.36 --> 02:49:19.68
but it can really easy catch catch hold of your whole household everything is burning everything is on fire.
