Yeah, that's actually when you think about it like a lot of us kind of do that like like uh, you know I'm just tired or something like that, you know like if you like if girls crying or something or something like this Oh, no, I just had something in my eye. and you know How in the video they show you know like clips from the actual seminar that they held last time or something like a pro I'm gonna end then you can't help but compare it to like the mustard situation and it's like man night and day You know, I'm the one this cool looks like people getting good information but But yeah, you don't kind of think yeah, that is a good way to put it because if you don't say it like that or you don't present it like that It kind of in a way makes you think Why can't bend that rule then you know and it kind of it's like two the people might be too cavalier about the whole thing about making the exception and then the the unexpected example If you get caught in someone by someone like when Dean does that where's like oh I'm gonna get you with this What he does is the equivalent of let's say like I don't know you he might not literally say that But you know it's coming I mean I do this to you right where you're like The general is the principal centenal of his army think about that the general is the principal centenal of the army The guy that's the guy that's keeping everyone safe is the general he's the primary watchstander for everyone He should always be careful of its preservation and that is never exposed to misfortune One falls into a feeling of security after battles when one is drunk with success and when one believes the enemy Completely disheartened So we all know that you know when that happens you know what Jeff Higgs told me if you tap a guy out like if you have someone that like legit You have you have battles with on the map and you tap them out You need to step it up What right after you're gonna step it up bringing a year all relaxed you're all celebrating your victory Don't do it step it up. it's not gonna work out I never wanted to be a spy of any kind you never to never wanted to be a spy of any kind never watched James Bond and it was like I'd really like to do that I've never watched a spy movie and thought like I don't know I don't like the It's like oh, I don't want him to think that I didn't know that when I really did kind of thing like I don't want him to think I'm like not what you need to do is you need to trust You need to trust the nature of the world and the nature of the world is that You will eventually be seeing as someone that actually does know that In 20 seconds in the future but he already Eliminate that exactly right and that's the way it works there and the other ones are just like how you're saying Where it's kind of like you know you attack this sweep and the arm bar and when they go to defend one or even both of A lot of times because they're ready for it, you know you went for the thing that you planned or it didn't Does that Dean does that one like let someone try and Armlock him or let him try and triangle It's always like we're going hard and you know There's not a lot of sleep going on or whatever in workouts and all that and you ever um you ever seen those Like videos or memes where they got one word that means a lot of different things Like I remember there was an old one about dude and it said like And you're gonna say that some people never rolled to the black belt before right right like even if they've been training for even like a year or something like that Some you know sometimes that's how it goes, you know You have to make it happen You have to be an aggressive general and they're rare Is like you know what there's actually not even any competition Like there's no competition for it like if you're you're there you are such hide if you're a person that can make things happen You are in such high demand you're gonna you're gonna be set yeah like extreme meaning like don't deviate from thinking like this kind of thing not like When I go in I'm just owning everything no exceptions What you say doesn't matter. Yeah, oh, yes, very sure by try to you Choose or put up the ones that I think Applied all of us in one way or now there's so many times like people will say hey this is just on time right here This little message because they were thinking this or something like that because they're placed all of a sudden Bro one of our bros that's kind of uh, you know, we're not super tight We got some other people coming on board right now, which is awesome awesome guys and what we do is we solve problems through leadership That's what we do at Ashalan front Ashalan front dot com coming get some effectively I feel like I'm kind of like this ongoing kind of Ashalan front of you know of your consulting, you know just because I'm always kind of around Yeah, because it's not like this just this over Abundance of people making hey I work with businesses all the time The the every every single business I work with is looking for good people that are gonna make things happen Yeah, that's just all of them 100% I never went to a business there like and then It takes a big involvement in like big involvement from the attacker person, you know in the demonstrations like whoa That might not happen that might not happen I remember there was people teaching me that if you hit someone in the neck with like a karate chop straight up That would they were teaching me this if you hit someone in the neck It's gonna knock them out. He's like oh Got it That I'll say what this book was I don't know if it's the translation or whatever, but there's definitely some long complicated sentences that were a little bit tricky for for me sure had a read of a few times Back the book there Let me by saying that what I mean is like sometimes you know a movie from 1987 is a better example That's what that's what you hear for stupid real love here There is another ruse Which is that if you find the enemy too strong to attack him you help him with the means of dividing his forces Is it that an exception though because you know how like everything you know You can do something too much Like you know like if you're that we're encouraging me. You know if you're like a young person or an old person or your person listening to this If you can make things happen, yeah, it's like incredible and you will go far in life If you sit back and you wait for things to happen, it's not good and you won't go far in life Nothing is gonna just happen because you Helgif you cross your fingers. and then if you're really drink too much it Makes you feel kind of sick in my experience this just regular the same amount of drink of regular coffee It put me over into nausea immediately no like maybe the seed of belly dude No, it wasn't like pain like how something it'll it's like it's in your head well that's what they'll say if they're hungover, you know what uh People in the teams that would say people do the opposite and they have like problems at home Like calling and say like yeah, Yeah, that actually sounds familiar like I might have seen a shirt like that before I don't know if you saw that shirt maybe other people made it because they probably there's probably like 12 of those Turns back It's not something echoed Yeah, but even like a karate situation like a guy who can who kick a bag like that guy Does know how to kick by the way and there's some forms of karate. Is it a is it a unwritten like rule that if you go to get the fight I'm gonna try and hold you back because you can't like whisper this over like hold me back I know but back in back in the day before everyone knew that tactic. Oh, yeah, so if your arm is like isolated since you Don't really detect like Immediate threat you like dang my arm stuck, but hey, that's not it's kind of okay for right now. So when you're the leader you just can't throw that order out there and expect it's all gonna happen the way you expected it to Not gonna happen you gotta go expected with your own eyes Back to the book no, before I go back to the book he's gonna talk about How important it is to understand the battlefield and the terrain here we go knowledge of the country Is to a general what a rifle is to an infantryman and what the rules of arithmetic are to a geomactrition If he does not know the country he will do nothing but make gross mistakes without this without this knowledge his projects Be them otherwise admirable become ridiculous and often impracticable Therefore study the country where you are going to act When it's desired to apply oneself to this essential part of war the most detailed and exact maps of the country that can be found are taken in examined and re-examined frequently If it is not in time of war the places are visited camps are chosen roads are examined the mayors of the villages the butchers and the farmers are Talk to one becomes familiar with the footpaths and the depth of the wood Their nature and the depth of the rivers their practical marshes and Those which are not and one observes in this study to distinguish carefully between the conditions of the marshes and the streams in the different seasons of the year It cannot be said that a stream is impracticable in the month of August because it had been in the month of April The road is chosen to be taken on such and such a march the number of columns in which the march can be made and All the strong camping places found on the route are examined to see if they can be used Gather your intel Gather your intel And when you know his intelligence and character you can use it to play on his weaknesses Everything which the enemy least six specks will succeed the best That's true a hundred percent That's why when you get like when you think about when you get caught gj to I would say most of the time it's getting caught with something that you didn't expect right some people Dean can do things and like he's gonna get it
