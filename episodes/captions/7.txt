00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000 This is Jockel Podcast number seven with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willinger.
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000 Ambush of dominating patrol at Niedon Keene.
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000 Niedon Keene is a small village in the midst of the jungles, and its extensive clear patches were developing as farms.
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000 The village had a couple of rice mills close for a long time, a school, a dispensary, and a small market next to the school.
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000 The market was itself a road junction with houses and huts around.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000 Northeastern the market, a couple kilometers away, was the post of the IPKF held in strength.
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000 North of the market was upon its rising embankment facing the post.
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000 It had become necessary to dominate Niedon Keene by day, as well as night at the height of operations in 88 and early 89.
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:17.000 Thereafter, dominating the market became a routine, and a gospel for the next battalion, since the relieved battalion in its handing over notes had mentioned the same.
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000 So the new battalion got into the rut and carried on without once asking why this action was necessary.
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:40.000 So much so that the new units dominating patrols even occupied the same trenches in the same fashion for the same period and checked the population in the same manner.
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:56.000 One change it made was to stop occupying the double, the only double story building in the bizarre, and instead occupy only the ground level trenches in the midst of the market.
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:07.000 The second change was to stop searching the nearby school and other buildings, where trenches and bunkers were made, thoroughly before occupying them.
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:22.000 The third change over a period was to stop being inquisitive about the increase or decrease of public attendance in the market, school and other buildings.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000 The battalion for months had not been involved in any kind of encounter, not even caught or seen a mouse.
00:02:33.000 --> 00:03:00.000 So this is setting the stage and I'm reading from a book called Assignment, Jaffna, which is about the war, the long civil war, you know, small country called Sri Lanka, and it's written by a lieutenant general, sardish pande, who was a commander there on the ground.
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000 And what's interesting about this book is a very rare book.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000 In fact, I after I picked it up and started reading through it, and I figured other people might want to get it.
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000 I looked on Amazon and it's a rare book that you have to buy from individual buyers.
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:40.000 And the reason that I have it is because I bought it on the ground in Sri Lanka. In the 90s, when I was attached to a seal unit that went to Sri Lanka to help train the Sri Lankan soldiers to fight against the Tamil Tigers, which was an insurgent terrorist group.
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:57.000 Called the LTT, the liberation tigers of Tamil, Ilam. It is an ethnic group that lived in Sri Lanka and had been mistreated and had now wanted their own state.
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.000 So this opening of this book, or the opening of the chapter that I just read about this ambushes, catches a couple things that I think are very important.
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.000 Number one, you heard me say that the new battalion got into this rut and carried on with this mission without once asking why it was necessary.
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000 And I think this is very important for everybody to remember that when you get tasked with something, you need to ask why you're doing it.
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:39.000 You need to understand why you're doing something. Don't just carry on because it's the way it's always been done. Ask that question why. And one of the things that I learned a very hard lesson on.
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:49.000 On my first deployment to Iraq, we would get, you know, we'd get a target that would come down the chain and they'd tell us, hey, there's a bad guy in this building.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:03.000 And we would literally get a map of some area of Iraq or Baghdad or some city in Iraq like Baghdad. And on the map, there would literally like a like a cheesy movie.
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000 There would be a red X on the target building.
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000 And that would be the building. And we'd go out and hit it. And I remember one time we did an operation.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000 And we went and took down this target, the building that had the big red X on it, and got the guy that we thought was a bad guy.
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000 And anyways, to make a long story short, when we got the person back.
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000 And we interrogated him and went through the intelligence that we had taken from the house.
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:45.000 It turned up that guy was not a bad guy. He was just a guy that had been, you know, somehow mixed up with something that ended up giving us this quote unquote intelligence.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000 And so from then on, and as I dug, as I pulled the thread on the red X, I figured out that, you know, just someone had had three houses to choose from.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000 And for whatever reason, put the axe on that house. They had no real intelligence behind it.
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000 And so I always would tell the story to the young seals and say, you know, find out who put the axe on the target building.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000 And make sure that there's a damn good reason why they put that red X there.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000 So it's also going back to the paragraph that I started with, is you could see that these guys were occupying the same trenches, the same fashion, the same period, and the same manner.
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:35.000 So they are definitely locked into a pattern that is going to cost them dearly. And it goes on to talk about the only changes they did make some changes, but all the changes were negative.
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000 All the changes were wrong. For instance, they did not occupy the one double story building.
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000 Now anyone that knows anything about tactics knows that you want to take the high ground.
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.000 You always want to have the high ground. And here they were in this bizarre, and they didn't take the one double story building.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000 So when you're in a two story building and everything else is a one story building, it gives you, you can see much further. It's a dominating position.
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000 You can shoot up, shoot people much easier.
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000 And so you have to take the high ground. And there's a seal that I know that kind of took that thought.
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000 And he had a great quote, which was, take the high ground or the high ground will take you.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.000 And you know, when I talk to people about moral or ethical issues, I use that very quote.
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000 Take the high ground or the high ground will take you. So you know, stay on the straight and narrow path.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000 So going back to this.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000 On a routine round of the days morning activity, a patrol of about 20.
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000 Got out of the post at Daybreak, and pulled along the road to the rice mill, entered the market,
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000 dispersed into the different trenches and bunkers, got into them and started the days dominating work.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000 And this term dominating basically means they're going to go out in control of the area.
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000 That's what this term is referring to when they use this term dominating.
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000 Majority the trenches were in the were joining the school premises.
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000 The school was closed as it was a holiday.
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000 Doors and windows were locked from the outside.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000 Attendance in the market was thin.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000 Some shops had not opened.
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000 Normally they should have.
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:36.000 So if you remember earlier, it says the third change over a period was to stop being inquisitive about the increase or decrease of public attendance.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000 In the market.
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000 So it's like the Scooby-Doo old Scooby-Doo cartoon.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000 Where, you know, they say, oh, it's quiet a little too quiet.
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000 And that's exactly what this is.
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000 And this is something that we would see in Ramadi, you'd see the streets clear out.
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000 Because the local populace would know somehow that there was an attack that was imminent.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000 Around breakfast, all hell broke loose.
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000 The doors and windows of the school suddenly opened fire and started.
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000 And started incoming into the trenches and bunkers in front almost at point blank range.
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000 Thereafter grenades were thrown into the trenches.
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000 As those few outside the school tried to react, the militants occupying the double story building brought murderous fire on them below.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000 Every movement was picked up.
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000 The two-inch mortar detachment which had stayed off and was still behind across the school was only,
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000 was the only element not hit or engaged.
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000 It quickly got behind some covering fired a few bombs.
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000 Then they too were picked up.
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000 Barely a few managed to get behind some building on the other side and kept a disultry volley of shots.
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000 It was all over in the market.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000 But not on its outskirts.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:11.000 So now you have these guys that had been in these positions and clearly the insurgents had set up on them completely and just unleashed in moments had them gunned down.
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000 The post, so the post is where these guys had patrolled to this market from.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000 The post reacted quickly and sent a relief patrol directly to the school through open patty fields.
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000 The militants had correctly anticipated it.
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000 As you can imagine, the militants knew exactly where the post was.
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000 They knew when they hit these guys that they would send reinforcements.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000 Here come the reinforcements. They're ready.
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000 They gave a searing welcome to the relief party and pinned it to the ground.
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.000 The post mortars had been deployed and fired on the bund of the Kalam, which dominating heights of the militants had a mobilized relief column.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000 The militants seemed to be enjoying it as they pumped automatic fire into the post itself from the nearby jungle edge.
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000 Although this fire was more in the nature of a gesture of defiance.
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:13.000 So they not only were hitting the market, but they had coordinated that when the market, when they started to attack the shri-long, or sorry, the Indian soldiers in the market.
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000 As soon as they started that, then when that reaction force came from the post, they hit the post as well.
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000 As quickly as they had half an hour later, the militants stopped firing.
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:36.000 As quickly as they had started it and melted away with the booty of weapons from more than a dozen killed and wounded soldiers of the dominating patrol.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000 So obviously a horrific situation.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000 And this is where the general asks some questions, some poignant questions.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000 What kind of training had this battalion done?
00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:00.000 What manner of mental, additunal, professional preparation headed achieved before being inducted into the battlefield in Sri Lanka?
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:09.000 What attention did its previous brigade and divisional commanders give the training and attuning it before dispatching it to Sri Lanka?
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:23.000 Surely it was forced to keep doing its station duties, providing working parties for golf courses, clubs, sports events, and other peacetime activities senseless.
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:38.000 So what he's saying there is that while this force was back in India, instead of training, what they were doing was helping with golf events and taking care of the local sporting events.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000 That they were doing, helping with the clubs, cleaning up.
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000 They weren't training for war, which is what they should have been doing.
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000 And that's the domination squad.
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000 That's the domination squad.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000 Yeah, this is the guy, they were not ready.
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000 Where the CO stood up, resisted peacetime demands, made by selfish, peace-oriented,
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000 brigade and divisional commanders and trained their men.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000 They and their units did well.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000 They saved on casualties and sought the enemy.
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000 So he's saying that the commanding officers back in India that stood up and said,
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000 Look, we're not going to manage the golf game.
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000 We're not going to go clean up the club over there.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000 We're going to train for war.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000 Those guys did well.
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:37.000 Where newly inducted units failed and senselessly suffered, the blame must squarely and entirely fall on the unprofessional,
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000 indifferent brigade and divisional commanders from whose formations such units came as reliefs in Sri Lanka.
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000 It was a breach of faith all along, so painfully, so very painfully callous and unprofessional,
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000 even as late as the beginning of 1989.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000 So you had this, the IPK, which is the Indian peacekeeping force, who has really fought in all kinds of different wars all over the world.
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.000 But they had been sent in to Sri Lanka to try and coel the violence between the Sri Lankan government and the LTT.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000 And they, first of all, they thought they were going to be getting, they thought they were going to be in a peacekeeping mission.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000 And they ended up not being, I mean, they ended up being on a peacekeeping mission, but they ended up in serious combat with,
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000 with the two of the tigers.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:39.000 So it's, these questions that he asks, you know, what kind of training did they have, what attention was paid,
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000 these are things that if you're in a leadership position, you should be asking yourself,
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000 what position are you putting your people into and how well have you trained them for it?
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000 And if you have not trained them for it, then you need to train them for it.
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000 And also assessing where you are going to end up.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:05.000 And this is something that when I was running training in the SEAL teams, I was always training guys for the worst case scenario.
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000 In fact, we would do, we would set up operations where we'd tell them, okay, you're just going to go and meet with the local tribal leader,
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000 and we'd have actors that were going to play the local tribal leader.
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000 And we just want you to go in there and drink tea with them and try and gather some information from them.
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000 And so there you go, okay, and if they didn't prepare properly, they would get destroyed.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000 Because of course, we lower them in and say, oh, yes, the tribal leader is ready to meet with you.
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000 Oh, great.
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000 Lower them into the room and then all of a sudden you take that guy hostage, you kill him and then you start.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000 So he'd cause total man, but the point was you always had to prepare for the worst case scenario.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000 And that's obviously not something that happened here.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000 I'm going into another ambush.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000 It was a good unit.
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000 Had trained and prepared well before coming into Sri Lanka in late 1988.
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:11.000 It had well taped up drills, the unit, and subunit commanders planned their operations as innovatively as circumstances permitted.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000 And took pains to avoid routine. So these guys were a little bit sharper.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:25.000 One of the biggest things you need to watch out for in a combat situation is routine and doing the same thing over and over again and giving a pattern of life that people can recognize and take advantage of.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000 So these guys were trying to avoid that.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:40.000 They're one slip-up was that they did not take enough pains to detect the setting in of routine and inclination to find comfort and slackness.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000 So that means they did a good job when they were fresh.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000 But once they started feeling tired, they would slip into routine and they'd slip into slackness.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000 Like complacency.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000 Complacency.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000 As a newly inducted unit, the men were alert up and about keen and for a long time nothing happened.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000 And this is something that people try to express about combat but combat is often a lot of waiting.
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000 And sometimes they picture this. Sometimes they portray this well and the better in the better movies about combat.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000 They show these long periods of waiting and that can be what combat is.
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000 And what's happening here is this unit is there.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:39.000 And for a long time nothing's happening. So when nothing happens, you start to get more and more complacent.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:49.000 In mid-May 1989, on a day when the road to elephant pass had to be opened by the unit.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:59.000 One of the posts and route detailed it's platoon to ensure security of a stretch of road for a distance of about two kilometers.
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000 Lippel-tune split into four parties of six to seven men each.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:17.000 And set out to search the road physically and secure an area stride to it a distance of 300 to 500 meters within its given beat.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:28.000 Having cleared the roads, these parties established squads 300 to 400 meters away from the road from where they could observe the road stretch and the area strided.
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000 At varying intervals, one squad was to move out and relieve the next one and so forth.
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000 The chain would of relief would go. Sometimes clockwise, sometimes anti-clockwise.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.000 This was to overcome boredom of void routine and keep mobile at add times and thus dominate the stretch.
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000 So what they're doing is they've got their little squad set up and then occasionally one squad would go move to another squad's position.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000 And that squad would go to another squad's position.
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000 So they would just do that to keep moving, keep mobile, not get complacent.
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000 The road had been kept open for the whole day for up and down convoy.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000 So they had to keep this road open because they were running convoy's to another area.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000 A Jason to the road ran the railway line too, over which that day two trains were to run.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000 It would be a long day as all such road rail opening days were.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:32.000 So this is kind of a common mission for them to secure these roads and these railroad tracks to get convoy's through to bring logistical supplies to other parts of the military.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.000 The platoon secured the area and saw the convoy and the trains through by about 1030.
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000 So 1030 the morning, they'd gone by.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000 They would now have to wait for the returning convoy and trains in the afternoon.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000 The sun was well up in the sky and the men were being baked.
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000 Humidity added to the discomfort.
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000 It was time for the squads to get up and move out to relieve the next one.
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000 Number one and number two squads were north of the T junction about 405 meters, 500 meters away from it.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000 Number four and three squads were opposite.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000 One and two respectively south of the road.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:29.000 Number one squad, however, over a period had quietly decided to reduce this distance and establish itself next to the T junction in a thick coconut grove, which had good shade.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000 So there's that opportunity instead of baking out in the sun, we're just going to kind of get a little bit closer to the road,
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000 get a little bit closer to the T junction, we're going to sit in some shade.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000 The squad occupied the grove as it had been doing and relaxed against the trees.
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000 It was comprised of six men.
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000 They did not feel the necessity of posting centuries.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000 No guards were out.
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000 The militants had noticed this routine, so this whole time they're being observed.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000 And you know, that's something you've always got to expect, you've always got to expect that you're being watched.
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:18.000 About 15-mm militants with weapons slowly drove a vehicle to the T junction and went on dropping a few members at four or five places around,
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000 I'm sorry, across the branch road, opposite the Honolert squad barely 40 meters away.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000 Then they occupied a few old trenches dug by the IPKF during the previous year.
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000 So here are these guys basically asleep and sitting in this coconut grove and 40 meters away.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000 I mean, you played football, 40 less than half a football field away, you've got the insurgents getting in position.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000 Is it indicating that they were doing that on purpose?
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000 Like, that was their tactic to lollum to sleep a little bit?
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000 Or is it just kind of just sheer complacency on the right thing that I think I don't think I had a weight along the sleep?
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000 I'm sure that they were watching this area, I'm sure that this was an area that they had done this mission before.
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000 And so they probably sat there and watched them do this three or four or five or ten times in the past.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000 And when these guys were a state alert, then they wouldn't attack them.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000 They just watched and waited and finally one day they see them.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000 It's a hot day, they go down and watch, they see them getting complacent.
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000 They move into position.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000 Yeah, so it's not like they were waiting as a tactic, like let's not do anything and create this feeling of inactivity.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000 So they go to sleep, just have that happen to get.
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000 But I bet you're there in the kitchen.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000 And over and over again, and every time that that squad was alert, they just said, okay, we're not going to hit them.
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000 You know, we used to say that about when we were driving on my first deployment to Iraq and we'd be driving around in our homies with no armor on them.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000 We would say, look, our protection is that we're going to look alert. We're going to have our guns scanning.
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000 We're going to be everyone's going to have a gun pointed at the, you know, at a target somewhere, wherever you think would be a target.
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000 So that if an surgeon is going to attack us, they're going to look at us and say, you know what, let's wait till a little less aggressive convoy came through.
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000 And it usually worked.
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000 And we only got to ambush a few times.
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000 And so to generally, I assume that that work well for us, considering how often ambushes were happening.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000 Yeah.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:32.000 Around 1100, around 1100 hours, all of them poured bullets into the resting squad, not one remained alive, not one could fire back.
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:42.000 Thus, just then the number four squad, which had up, which had upstocked from its location, south of the main road and was going to number one's location to relieve it.
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000 Endered into the inferno.
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000 The opening volley of the militants who were watching caught and killed four of this party too and wounded the other two.
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000 Just as they were entering the grove.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:06.000 Out of these two, once come soon, but the other who survived, froze, took no further part, perhaps fainting death and survived.
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:16.000 Hearing this firing, the number three squad, which was about a kilometer away, rushed in very fast.
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000 And was at the site in less than 10 minutes, even as the militants were still firing.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:30.000 The number two squad also reached the site, a little north, simultaneously, to engage the retreating militants.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:50.000 This promptness was good, but was not, but what was not was that the two groups having connected or having contacted and exchanged fire with the militants at that site did not pursue the militants and allow them a clean break.
00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:03.000 So these other two squads, when the firing started, they rushed in from two different directions and actually weren't a good position to do some big damage to the militants.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000 But they didn't.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:16.000 It is all the more regrettable because the two parties had contacted the militants from two directions and were thus in a position of considerable advantage.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000 Instead, all of them converged on the site and started getting hold of the dead and wounded.
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000 So instead of attacking, they all just converged on the guys that were dead and wounded and started taking care of them.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000 But losses amounted to 10 killed and one wounded, the militants suffered one dead.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000 So again, a horrible situation.
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:56.000 The glaring example of cross complacency on the part of our brave soldiers, who neither firmly adhere to the spirit and content of basic tactical teaching, nor thinks it's necessary to use that little brain God has given.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:06.000 Our teaching and officering methods make sure that the soldier does not use his gray matter and develop a guyel.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:26.000 So what he's saying is the way that they train these troops and how they treat them, they get them so that they don't use their brain.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000 They don't use their brain.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000 And that's something that we've talked about on this podcast multiple times.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000 And then we're going automatically.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000 No, to try and make sure that the training that you do expands your brain and makes you think.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.000 I told quite a few stories about how my goal when I was running training was to put these guys in situations where the only way out was to use their brain.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000 Not to use their physical skills, not to use the tactics that they already knew.
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:06.000 They're not going to use their training that had been embedded into their brain, but to think of their own solution to a problem.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:20.000 You know, when you, when you, this I can jujitsu, when you see someone that is really masterful in jujitsu, that person that you consider that is the person that you see get into a position and they do something completely unexpected.
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.000 That kind of training that I want to do for people to put them in positions where they have to do something that's unexpected and new and that they created.
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000 Nobody from the patrol could be punished.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:41.000 Those who made the mistake were already dead.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000 It's a damn shame.
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:58.000 So to talk a little bit about this book, this book, as I said, it's called a assignment, Jaffna by Sardish Pandey, Lieutenant General Sardish Pandey.
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000 And here's his opening to the book.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000 And I think this is one of the most honest openings to a book I've ever heard.
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:15.000 This book is an attempt to present to the reader an account of Operation Pawan, our considerable endeavor on military diplomatic,
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000 political front in Sri Lanka from 1987 to 1989, a period of over two and a half years.
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000 And this is where I think this guy is just beautifully honest.
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000 I lay no claim to scholarship and research on the subject.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000 Nor have I had ready at hand documentary back up to substantiate my remarks and conclusions.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000 I have not attempted to consult others who were closer to the decision makers or even the decision making process itself.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:52.000 I kept no notes, no diaries, not even compared notes with my peers, colleagues or subordinates.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000 With my seniors, I had the normal all-too-human quota of professional animus.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.000 I did my job as I understood, perceived it or sorry, perceived and fought it appropriate.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000 In my post-retirement glow, I simply reminisced.
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:22.000 Memories researched as I did so, not always with precise contextual precision perhaps, but with sufficient clarity to heat up illuminate and see through this effort.
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:34.000 And this is something that I went whenever I'm the books that have always kind of hit me in the books that we've used in this podcast are these books that I find value in,
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000 and that's the books with kind of unaltered thoughts and it's usually coming from the person itself.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:51.000 That's one thing that automatically gives me a negative impression or not a negative impression, but I love hearing it the voice of the person that did it.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000 I want to hear from that person.
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000 As soon as you interpret it, as soon as someone else's interpret it, you know it's getting spun somewhere another.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000 Intentionally or not, there's a different viewpoint. And this is something that I used to when we were running training or when I was running training,
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000 and you'd have a guy do something.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:18.000 You'd have a guy coming to a room, and this is just a training operation, but you'd have a guy coming to a room and there'd be a doorway or a prisoner or a hostage.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000 And they would do something dumb or crazy or wrong.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000 But, you know, some guys would say, you know, go and do it again. You know, go and do that again.
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:39.000 And although we would definitely make them do it again, I would always make them deal with what they did, because they did whatever their instincts told them to do.
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000 And what your instincts told them to, guess what, your instincts were wrong. Now you still have to deal with it.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:31:00.000 So I like these guys that talk about what they did, and as you can see from those first two stories, this guy's talking about what they did wrong, what happened bad, and his assessment of why.
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000 I'm going to continue.
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:13.000 It is the account of the happenings as seen through the eyes of a divisional commander who in war, in my opinion, in experience, is the main link between strategy and tactics.
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000 And the main difference between perception and insight.
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:32.000 So he's in a good position. He's kind of seeing what was, you know, how that strategy of what the goal was, how that got interpreted into the ground.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000 There are others who cherish macro level viewing and tend to underrate ground realities.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:57.000 This is another thing that I always look for. Now of course, I'm interested in what the general say, absolutely. I'm always interested in what the president say, or what the, the prime minister says, and how the general's took that, and what they did with it, and those broad strategies, I'm very interested in that. I always want to read about that.
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:11.000 And in what he's saying, there's others that cherish the macro level viewing, which is what that is, the generals, and tend to underrate the ground realities, and I agree with him.
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000 I belong to the former category.
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:26.000 Mine was termed a worm's view, and I preferred it that way, meaning he is the guy that was on the ground, and this is what he saw, as if he was a worm on the ground.
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000 How on the ground he was, I knew exactly where I stood.
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:42.000 It is this that produced considerable disillusionment, friction, and differences with superior headquarters and planners.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:33:07.000 Once again, this is something that I always find intriguing when you get these guys, these soldiers, people like Hackworth, people that are dedicated, you know, lifelong military members, and they get this twist of disillusionment and suspicion against their higher headquarters.
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:24.000 I'm not shouting myself horse, but the juggernaut rolled on unheating. So despite this guy's protests and talking and trying to explain the juggernaut rolled on unheating.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:39.000 There's a school of thought, which says that mistakes were bound to be made in the complex and undertaking of projecting power outside our national geographic confines, and that these have to be taken and stride.
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000 So yeah, hey look, we're going to have mistakes, they're going to happen, we just have to deal with them and move on.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:34:02.000 My intention is that if we consider ourselves professional soldiers and experts in concerned fields, then there was no need to and no excuse for committing most of these mistakes.
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:24.000 After all, it was human lives and limbs which were being lost. We know we have an abundance of manpower, even cheap human lives in this country, but that does not give us the power of attorney to waste them.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:45.000 And I think that's a sediment that anybody that's been on the front lines can understand is that it's easy to write those checks from the government or from the re-eraśual on or from the safe place.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:59.000 But those checks that you're writing are human lives and no one should write that check without a heavy burden on their mind.
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:24.000 There is a good deal of eye in the narration. It is not so much because of my ego to show up myself or to put others always in the dock, but simply because it is a compilation of what eye as a cog in the gigantic wheel saw felt perceived and got influenced by.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:41.000 I think it's interesting that this guy is saying, look, the books about me and I apologize and I'm not trying to be e-cautistical and actually in reading that right now, I know that on multiple discussions that I've had about the book that lay for me I wrote, we're doing the same thing.
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:53.000 We're like, look, it's not, you know, sorry, we're not. It's not about us, it's about what we learned and I think he's trying to make the same statement there.
00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:03.000 Sri Lanka was a fascinating assignment, the most challenging of my life, the most tense, the most rewarding.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000 I think that anybody that's been in tense combat will tell you that's the most rewarding thing that they will do in their life.
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:23.000 I am grateful to my colleagues, subordinates, peers, and our magnificent men, steady, solid as they are.
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:34.000 I have a high regard for the LTT for its discipline, dedication, determination, motivation, and technical expertise.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000 So there he is, he's talking about the enemy and you've heard me say it on here is you have to respect your enemy and there he is.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000 He is high regard for the LTT and its discipline and dedication and determination and motivation and their technical expertise.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000 That's everything.
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:03.000 But find little justification in its senseless, malicious, destructive insistence on continuation of military means in the search of an honorable solution to the Tamile problem in Sri Lanka.
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:14.000 Any goes on, I think some of my earns-twall subordinates for helping me refresh my memory.
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000 Most of them took me seriously in war and remained two steps ahead of me in their spheres.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000 God bless them.
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:32.000 So, like me looking at the guys that worked with me and for me, I hold them in the highest regard for taking care of me.
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000 Then he's saying the same thing.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:51.000 Fashion apart, I genuinely feel I must dedicate this personal account to the young officer, the young soldiers, and the Jaffton Tamiles who made me a good soldier and a better human being in my own eyes.
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000 I think that's just an outstanding opening for a book.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:06.000 Now, getting into the tactics.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000 On their arrival, he goes on to say, our tactics were predetermined, straight-jacketed, predictable and reactive.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000 These rows only a little above what is known as minor tactics in military terminology.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000 That is tactical arrangement and drills at section-in-putoon level.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:35.000 Counter-insurgency operations demanded far more innovative and integrative formulations at company, battalion, and formation levels.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000 This is obviously something that we had to deal with in Ramadi.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000 And that was this idea of counter-insurgency.
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:54.000 It's so, it's infinitely more complex than a situation where two uniformed military groups are fighting against each other.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000 Everything is clear. It's very easy to understand.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000 They have a different shaped helmet. They have a different colored uniform.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000 And we're going to get on our different sides of the lines and we're going to go and destroy them.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000 And an insurgency is just infinitely more complex.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000 People mixed in with the populist, the populist swaying back and forth on who they support, wanting to protect the populist from the insurgence.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000 Some of the populists supporting the insurgence and some of the populists supporting the host nation or the friendlies.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000 It's just an infinitely more complex situation.
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:36.000 How he explains it. Counter-insurgency remains essentially a company in Patoon commander's battle task.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000 So he's saying that it is those front-line guys that are actually going to make it happen.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000 However, he goes on.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000 They're concerted, integrated, mutually responsive and interconnected employment.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000 The man's particularized tactics at battalion and brigade levels.
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:10.000 And what that means is that the person who's overall in charge has got to do an outstanding job of explaining what the mission is and explaining how it's connected and explaining how what is going to happen on the front-line is going to affect the broad strategy.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:23.000 Getting that commander's intent down to the front-line is critical. This is something that when I was in Ramadi and I was working for Colonel Sean McFarlane, who's now General McFarlane, who is just an unbelievably outstanding leader.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:35.000 But he was able to get his intent from him to the battalions, to the companies, to the platoons, to the squads and right down to the front-line leadership.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:48.000 Very similar situation that Colonel McFarlane was able to execute in a just an outstanding way.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:56.000 So now we get to beyond the strategy or beyond the tactics.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000 And as we talked about on the last podcast, what always interests me more is the principles of war.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000 And how different people in different situations see those principles.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:16.000 And how those principles of war can be translated into principles of life.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:23.000 And principles of business and principles of fighting and principles of relationships and everything that you're doing.
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:37.000 And really also the principles of the war within and the war that we have within ourselves to beat back the insurgents that are in our mind.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:47.000 You know, being back the emotions that are in our mind that are trying to make us weak and trying to bring us down and trying to keep us from being the best that we can be.
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:55.000 So those principles of war apply to so many different things and that's why I find them so fascinating.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:04.000 And luckily enough, the good general has a section that's called principles of war.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:16.000 Principles of war distilled from conventional warfare are well known, but their degree of relevance in insurgency wars is not the same.
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000 Again, we're talking about insurgency much more complex.
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.000 Insurgency is total war in the sense that involves people too in an intimate and positive manner.
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:36.000 Employees all sinews of war, political, social, economic, psychological, diplomatic and military.
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:47.000 It exemplifies determination and readiness for great sacrifices in pursuance of its goals.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000 It eggs, I'm going to read that again, echo. I'm not sure you got it.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000 It exemplifies determination and readiness for great sacrifices in pursuance of its goals.
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:05.000 So what you're trying to achieve in an insurgency, in a counterinsurgency situation is so hard to achieve.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000 It is so difficult to achieve.
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:19.000 Insurgency is an unrelenting, low intensity, long-drawn war with time and opportunity serving the interests of the insurgency.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.000 And wherein the insurgency designs to overcome his weakness in one's fear with strength in the others.
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:40.000 So in an insurgency, they don't have tanks, but they have time and they can wait you out and they can just pick away it to you.
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000 The death of a thousand cuts. That's what the fear is.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000 That's how the insurgency is going to win.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000 Is the death of a thousand cuts.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.000 And when I think about me or you or us as individuals,
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000 it's those little things. It's those little cuts. It's those little times.
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000 It's those little situations where you cut yourself a little bit of slack.
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000 And that's the insurgency winning. That's the insurgency beating you.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:23.000 So the principles themselves relentless pursuance of the aim.
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:31.000 The TTE was clear in its aim and unrelenting in its pursuit.
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000 Elam and political settlement on its terms.
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000 Elam was the name that they wanted to give the state for the the timbles.
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:50.000 And that was their clear aim with no, no other possible modifications that they wanted their own state period.
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000 On the other hand, we were not very clear about our aim.
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000 Destruction of the LTT or weakening it. If the latter than to what degree,
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:07.000 we had not fought through the eventuality of the Sri Lankan government refusing to fulfill its part of the accord obligations.
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000 We did not know what to do with a warring LTT, hostile population, or recalcitrant Sri Lankan government.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:30.000 And as it finally turned out, we were not even sure of what our national interests were and what military intervention and later military operations were required to achieve.
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000 This is when you hear all the time about people saying, oh, you got to write down your goals.
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000 So this is what they're talking about. You got to know what your goals are. You got to have them clear.
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000 And then you got to have a relentless pursuance of the aim. That's how you get things done.
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000 It's kind of like when people are like, I got to get them better shape, but that's it.
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It needs to be a clear goal. What does that mean?
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000 Is that a certain amount of running? Is that a body weight that you're trying to reach?
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000 Is that a strength goal? What does that goal?
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000 Do you write it down? Do you know exactly what it is and is it clear?
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:19.000 Next, aggressive spirit. It's an interesting how we keep hearing this word aggression and aggressiveness in all these different principles of war.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000 Aggressiveness is so important.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000 And what we talked about on the last podcast and I talked about how it had to be balanced.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000 But it has to be balanced.
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000 But man, it has to be there. That aggressiveness has got to be there. In low intensity, long, drawn conflict,
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000 unflagging aggressive spirit is a vital importance far more than in conventional offensive action.
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:54.000 The LTT had realized it thoroughly and practiced it with great deliberation and to great effect.
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000 We were somewhat lacking in it.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:09.000 And I think this insurgency and this talking about an insurgency when we're talking about life and becoming better is because it is a long-term struggle.
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:17.000 Right? You know, the conventional war is a fast war where you know what's going to happen.
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000 You know what your enemy is you go and you fight them and it's done. It's very easy.
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:32.000 The conventional, I mean, the, the, the, the insurgent war is more like what we go through as humans trying to improve because it's a long, drawn out struggle.
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:41.000 And we're, we got pieces of our brain that are changing sides just like the local populist might in its very, very challenging.
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:50.000 And that's why this notion of aggressiveness and knowing what your aim is and then this relentless pursuance of this aim and getting aggressive as you pursue that aim.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:01.000 Can you see how how important those are? Obviously in an, in an encounter in search and situation, but also as you develop your plan to become a better person and a better leader.
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000 Oh yeah absolutely critical.
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:13.000 Especially, I mean, one of the many things similar to the insurgent comparison is the temptations that come up every day.
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:21.000 No matter if you're trying to make more money, you know, with your own business or get in shape, get in shape is a good one.
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000 I think so easy to talk about. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and a lot of parallels that in my opinion are really clear.
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:42.000 So these temptations just like the insurgents they'll pop up or they won't be around for a day, two days and then one day it's your best friends birthday and you know, he's going to, I don't know, dunk and don't know, something for you know,
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000 there it is. Birthday and there it is. All of a sudden yeah, an insurgent attack.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000 And they come up every day on a spec that will sometimes are expected, but sometimes not expected.
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000 It's just so dynamic in that way, where all these things are there to kind of get you and what's good when those things come to get you,
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000 get any aggressive mindset where you'll get aggressive with that situation, you get aggressive with those donuts.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000 Yeah, I mean, aggressive we put them in the garbage. Yeah, and that's so true.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:16.000 And one of these things do come up. It's so it's so much. I don't say, yeah, I would say easier to be like, no, I'm I'm on the programmer now.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:25.000 If you're a graduate, if you're a pro, if you're like, you know, I'm going to allow excuses to get in my head or kind of kind of pussy foot around and be like, well, you know,
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000 moderation is all right kind of thing and have that attitude.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000 It's going to get you.
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:41.000 Yeah, you're aggressive. You can take, you know, take us to take in a way, take pride in the fact that it's nope, I'm not even going to go that's nope, I'm not drink, I'm not going out to the club drinking, I got a rest, I got to work out in the morning or whatever.
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000 Yeah, that aggression does help man.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000 That aggression does it.
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.000 It's, it's almost like if you don't, if you do kind of just kind of tip till your way through it, it wins.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000 Yeah, that's what it's like.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:03.000 It's like, you can't even get it done.
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000 It's the same thing with this with account of insurgency. You have to be aggressive. You can't let those little things creep in. And you've got to keep that relentless pursuance of the aim and you got to do it aggressively.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000 Yeah.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000 Next.
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000 Surprise.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:16.000 This embraces surprise at tactical strategic and political levels.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:42.000 The IPKF that's the Indian Peacekeeping Force could not do anything, could not do anything. In the tactical field, it was unable to match the LTT mainly because of the lack of innovation and serious application of all our professional acumen to stymie our to stymie the LTT, our methods largely remained conventional.
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:50.000 So surprise and how important surprises now.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000 How do we surprise ourselves?
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000 I can tell you. You've got to surprise yourself.
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000 If you can't surprise yourself, it means you lack creativity.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000 If you're not coming up with new ideas and new ways to do things, you're lacking creativity and you're lacking surprise.
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:14.000 So, you know, I was, I've been traveling a bunch lately. And guess what? Sometimes in a hotel room.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:22.000 And I got to get creative on how to aggressively pursue my aims. And that means I got to do, you know, maybe my work out was 300 burpees.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000 That's it. Boom.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:33.000 No squat rack there. No pull-up bar. No rings. No rower. Nothing. No kettlebells. No. And guess what? I'm my soul gets crushed.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:40.000 But that's just being creative and aggressively adapting to the situations that you get put into.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000 So you've got to maintain that adaptability, that creativity all the time. And I think that's absolutely critical.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000 Man, and that's one yet another one of those times where it's so easy to be like,
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000 Dang this hotel doesn't have a gym. Oh yeah.
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000 You know, or it's dangerous.
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000 Dang this is no like really healthy food or, there's the McDonald's right there.
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000 There's no healthy food in this town even. Yeah.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000 So that, that healthy food thing, especially when you look, start looking at intermittent fasting.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000 You know, oh, you're in the airport and they don't have, you know, all you can get is those,
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000 those little hot dogs wrapped in a pretzel. Those things are so tasty.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000 But you know, like you should not be eating those, right?
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:29.000 And sometimes you, you're like, oh, okay, I'll eat them. Why?
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000 You should be on the intermittent fast when you're in the travel situation.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000 Yeah. You don't need to be eating.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000 And I'm telling you this right now and it's fresh my memory because I had two of those bad boys this morning.
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000 And they were good. Yeah.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000 The weakness crept in.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000 You know, and I got some of those pretzel loft hot dogs.
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000 Dang. You know what is perfect? The one is perfect.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000 Next one, mobility and flexibility.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000 The insurgent must have developed, must develop intelligent and
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000 gifle flexibility in planning, conducting and overseeing actions.
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:14.000 So as to retain initiative, suffer the least damage and yet keep the opponent guessing.
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000 And in a prolonged state of readiness and uncertainty.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000 Such that the insurgent has to do. They got to be super flexible.
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000 They got to keep you guessing and keep you in a prolonged state of readiness.
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000 That sounds good, right?
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000 Prolong state of readiness. That sounds good, but it's actually not good.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000 When you constantly own an edge, that's where people down.
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000 It breaks them down over time.
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000 But where we failed was we did not exhibit enough flexibility in our strategic
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:48.000 and tactical plans and their gileful execution. We had to seize the initiative and
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000 pose challenges to the LTT, which we largely failed to do.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000 So you know, mobility, flexibility.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000 Something we talk about all the time on this podcast is having the ability to adapt and be flexible
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:06.000 and you know, whether it's working out in a hotel room, whether it's, you know, finding something good to eat
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000 or not eating because there is nothing good to eat.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000 Whether it's being in a leadership situation and you're adapting to a personality that you,
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000 that is awkward or different or you're not ready for, or a situation that needs to be overcome,
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.000 that's flexibility and mobility and you have to maintain that.
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000 Motivation and discipline.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.000 In prolonged, slow, bleeding, low intensity, people oriented struggle.
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Motivation and discipline as ingredients of morale are far more important.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:52.000 The LTT and the people had both these two remarkable degree.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.000 The IPKF's discipline was as good as any armies, even the LTT's.
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:05.000 But its motivation was limited to the spirit of professionalism only.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000 We were soldiers we did as ordered.
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:16.000 So the LTT had this passionate goal that they were going after and that encouraged their discipline.
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.000 They understood why they were doing what they were doing.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000 And that's something that clear goal.
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000 They understood why are we doing this because we were on our own state.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000 Now, did the IPKF know why they were doing what they were doing?
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000 No, they did not. They just, he just talked about that.
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000 They knew what their goal was. They knew how it was going to affect.
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000 They didn't know what their end state was supposed to be.
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000 So when you take that away from them, even though they're discipline troops, they missed that last level.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000 And that's why. Why are you doing this?
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000 And that is why it's so important for you as you try and reach your goals.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000 As you try and get something done, you keep that in mind of why you're doing this.
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000 What's the end state going to be? Because it's so easy to lose track of the end state.
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000 I mean, if you're trying to make, you know, you're trying to get gain 25 pounds of muscle.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000 I mean, that's going to take you a couple years, possibly.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000 If you're trying to make a million dollars, that may take you 10 years.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000 Might take you six years. That's a long ways.
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000 And there's a lot of distractions.
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000 I'm going to come all the way.
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000 Yeah. Into your point.
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000 Consider why. Why do you want to gain 25 pounds of, we'll say losing weight.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000 Right. So let's say you have a photo shoot.
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000 Or are you going on spring break or something like that?
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000 Let me just think of all the big photo shoots.
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000 I'm not going to wait. That's never happened.
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000 Let's talk about this. Let's talk about you trying to lose weight.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000 Because you're trying to be healthy.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000 Right. That's a long term goal that's realistic.
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000 Yes. Yeah. And whatever that means, right, healthy.
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000 Or what if your healthy person already, but you just want to.
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000 I don't know. Look better.
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000 Or achieve something.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000 How long you've got a jiu-jitsu turner coming up.
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000 Yeah. Right.
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000 Cut some weight. Right. Exactly.
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000 So it makes it so much easier to cut.
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000 I mean, when you have a specific. Yes.
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000 So you've got to fight coming up.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000 That guy's going to cut that weight.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000 Wait. Quick. You hear these guys cutting all this weight.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000 Like, oh, yeah. He has a fight in a month and a half.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000 And he got to cut 40 pounds.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000 And then he'll do it.
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000 Because yeah. I mean, obviously, they're trained athletes as well.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000 But that goal in understanding it.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000 Man, help so much.
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000 Especially when I'm going to read this part again.
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000 And again, we talk about when you're trying to get stuff done as a person.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000 It's a prolonged slow bleeding low intensity.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000 People oriented struggle.
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000 That's what it is. That's what you're up against.
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000 Yeah.
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000 You know, that's what you're up against.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000 It's a low anything that's worth achieving as a person.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000 It takes all those. It's long. It's slow.
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000 It's probably, you know, there's nothing.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000 You go, oh, this is going to be the ultimate achievement of my life.
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000 And it's going to take you 15 minutes to do.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000 Now, it's going to take you months and months and months and years of effort of blood
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000 sweat and tears to get there.
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000 Now, continuing with discipline and morale.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000 This goes into a section of the book where you start talking about their performance.
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000 And we're going to take a little bit of a turn here.
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.000 But I think it's important to bring up.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000 In the initial stages of the war in October to December of 1987,
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000 there were complaints and reports of rape,
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.000 looting, and want and destruction indulged in by the IPKF.
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000 When a soldier is pushed and led into a blind alley,
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.000 like the situation in Jafna, where it suddenly changed from so well,
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000 Tom Tomed piecekeeping operations into a full fledged battlefield.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:59.000 He feels terribly insecure and starts seeing an enemy all over.
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000 So we talked about this earlier.
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000 These guys, they're going on a nice piecekeeping mission,
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000 and they put their blue helmets on and, you know,
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000 be a referee.
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000 Well, the referee gets attacked.
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000 And this is starting to talk about the psychological effect it has,
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000 and they start seeing an enemy everywhere.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000 You know, and this reminds me of when I was in high school,
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000 and I was lucky enough to have a bunch of a Vietnam that were put me through high school.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000 And when I was in high school, the movie, Pultune came out.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000 And of course, I was, you know, all in the war and whatnot.
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000 So I went and saw the movie Pultune,
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000 and one of my teachers that wasn't Vietnam had seen the movie as well.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000 And I asked them straight up, you know, hey, what'd you think of the movie?
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:57.000 And he explained to me in a very solemn way that the movie depicted these Americans going in,
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:05.000 and, you know, brutalizing these villages and, you know, doing horrible things to these villagers.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:13.000 But the way he explained it to me, he said, listen, you know, we'd be in, in and around a village for three or four weeks.
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:23.000 And in that three or four weeks, they, the Americans would lose seven or eight guys to booby traps.
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000 And meanwhile, the villagers don't hit any booby traps.
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000 So they're out walking the same trails and the same areas through the right, same rice patties.
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000 And the villagers aren't hitting any booby traps.
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000 They're not getting blown up. They're not getting killed.
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000 So that means they kind of know where they are.
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000 And he said that kind of frustration is exactly what this is talking about right here.
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000 In and, and I'm going back to it.
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000 In an insurgency spark and sustained by an opponent who is dressed in civilian clothes,
01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000 but shoots and blows him up unseen, suspicion alone takes a vicious turn.
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000 When he sees his comrades being killed by innocent looking civilians,
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:15.000 blending again into the civilian population, he gets into a rage and anger against the uncertainty and the unseen.
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000 At that point, his pent-up tension, welling feeling of helplessness,
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000 and burning desire to explode into a release of counter violence,
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000 are in front of a tangible object he can master,
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000 an object which is weak and helpless itself.
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000 What better object than a frightened weak, countering woman,
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000 an unguarded, wide open shop,
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000 an unresisting defenseless house and its feeble occupants,
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:58.000 who sheltered the unseen deceitful opponent, had obtained by whatever means.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000 It is madness, the animal in him, that rules momentarily.
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000 He is wild, but just for a brief spell,
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000 if he can get a hold of himself or if someone controls him in that moment of crisis,
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:23.000 of cathartic explosion, he might not all probability get over his base or instincts.
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000 Where this does not happen, then the explosion manifests in counter assault,
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:39.000 rape, loot, and want in destruction, seeking release from tension, fear, and rage.
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000 Education, motivation, communication, and company, are good anecdotes, and anecdotes, sorry.
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:58.000 Most culprits realize within minutes of their act and repent,
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000 we being like children.
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:12.000 I saw an officer with 27 years of service breaking down like this.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000 So that's what happens to people.
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000 I think there's so much in that paragraph, this paragraph about this pent-up tension,
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000 and we've got to remember that it's extreme in a situation like this,
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000 that the tension is extreme, the fear is extreme, the rage is extreme.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000 But, and obviously for those that are listening that are in combat right now,
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000 that are deployed overseas, these are things that you have to watch out for.
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000 And especially as a leader, you've got to be the person that controls him in the moment of crisis
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000 of cathartic explosion.
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000 As a leader, that's got to be what your job is.
01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:03.000 And also, as you work in businesses, as a leader, you've got to sense now that things won't be as dramatic as this,
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000 but you can get people that do make mistakes in business.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000 They make ethical mistakes, they make more or more mistakes, they feel that pressure,
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000 and they want to lash out and they make mistakes.
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000 And you've got to get them through those moments, you've got to pay attention to it.
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000 It is under these circumstances back to the book.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000 It is under these circumstances of total uncertainty,
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000 initial disorientation, sudden violence, inability to communicate because there was language differences,
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:40.000 and lack of effective control and education that excesses were committed by a few, by a few.
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000 But the command and leadership chain rapidly gathered their brood once again,
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000 within the warmth of their moral influence and disciplinary binding.
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000 And quarries were instituted and disciplinary action taken against the defaulters.
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000 Warped minds had to be weeded out, but there were not very many.
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000 After February, to March of 1988, the incident rates dropped to almost zero.
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000 So they were able to get control of the situation, to weed it out, get rid of the sadists,
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000 and the folks that couldn't control themselves.
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:27.000 But this is the type of pressure that you see military people under,
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:35.000 and especially in these counterinserts and see operations like we've had for the last ten or 15 years in Iraq and Afghanistan,
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:42.000 where you have a local populist, you have IEDs, you have indirect fire mortars,
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000 and guys are getting killed, and where do you place the rage, where does it come out?
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:57.000 And that is a huge challenge for leadership to try and keep that in check to the best of your ability.
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:11.000 And speaking of leadership from the book, what we lacked in many and instance was what I should specifically emphasize,
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000 inspiring leadership.
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000 If the leader, particularly the formation commander, did not inspire his command,
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000 then that body of troops would be at half its effectiveness.
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000 So, late for an I talk about an extreme ownership.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000 Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield, and here is another example of saying,
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000 you know, he's saying that if the leader is not inspiring, they're going to be a half their effectiveness.
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:44.000 For instance, if he visited a post and the men did not talk warmly and quizzantly and fondly about the visit for the next week or ten days,
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000 and if they did not perceive a challenge left behind by the commander,
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000 not feel a spontaneous desire to meet it, in thinking it hard to solve, and thinking hard to solve it,
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000 and bracing to present an innovative novelty to the commander on his next visit,
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000 then it is better that this type of commander did not visit it all.
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000 So, these saying, you know, if you're not inspiring, if you're not inspiring your people,
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000 it's better not even to show up.
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000 Many formation commanders failed to inspire.
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000 Not many of them ruffed it out with the troops on patrols, ambushes,
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000 staying in their post at night, on road opening and raid or hell-lending missions.
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.000 And this is an example of kind of a negative example, and this is very clear.
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.000 And you actually see this portrayed in movies about Vietnam a lot, and you'll get that very quickly.
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000 The brigade commander would land by a helicopter and a post on a hell-a-pad, which had to be secured.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000 So, I mean, soldiers had to go out and like secure this hell-a-pad somewhere and set security around it,
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000 and move the brush and make sure there's no mines on it, etc. etc.
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000 Then the general would breeze past a few bodies lying in the muck and mud,
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000 beam a flashy smile to affect unconcern for danger, have a hurried chat with a local leader,
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000 blurred out directions or orders, sip a cup of tea or coconut juice,
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000 showing no concern for the soldiers who labored under those circumstances to prepare it,
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000 and offer before you could blink an eye, would be often this chopper.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000 What inspiration could his men in the post draw from that?
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:31.000 It's a stereotypical thing, and it really happens. It really does happen.
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:40.000 And you see that with not just military leaders, but you see that with senior leaders in big companies,
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000 where the folks on the front lines, on the construction side, or on the main,
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000 in the manufacturing plant, the boss is coming.
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000 So, what do they have to do? They have to do all this preparation. They've got to clean everything,
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000 they've got to go to think dialed in, and then the guy shows up for five minutes, and it took,
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000 you know, four hours to get everything ready, the guy shows up for five minutes,
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000 who asks the quarks mile, and then leaves.
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000 Is anyone inspired by that? No, absolutely not.
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000 We had three types of officers.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:22.000 One category was that which thought acted moved about, was bold, and got down to business fastest,
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000 even in totally alien confusing unknown environment.
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000 Getting down to business. That's the guy.
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000 The second one consisted of those who had the brains, and moved about as best they could,
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000 but lacked boldness and ability to inspire.
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000 The third category consisted of those who simply slogged when prodded,
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000 and complained about their troops not being trained,
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000 orders not being clearly given, and so on.
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000 They could do nothing else. They're units suffered.
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000 So that's the guy that doesn't take ownership of anything.
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000 This year that complained about their troops not being trained,
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000 orders not being clearly given, and so on.
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000 That guy is not a good leader.
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000 There's always doing this complaining that his orders weren't clear.
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000 He's complaining up and down the chain of commands.
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000 The guys blow me aren't trained right. The guys above me aren't giving clear orders.
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000 This guy's a disaster. Don't be that guy. Don't be that leader.
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:30.000 And here's a piece on leading from the front.
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000 There was a big battle, and there was a bunch of friendly casualties.
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000 And now I'm going to the books.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000 There are belongings, dress, and equipment.
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000 Lay tattered and strewn all over a huge playground.
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000 And I went up there on one of my visits.
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000 I thought this was disrespectful to the brave souls,
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000 and asked the escort team accompanying me to help pick up all those items
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000 and remove them from public gaze.
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000 To my acute horror, not one of them moved to pick them up.
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000 The escort team consisted of all denominations, but none dared.
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000 So here we are. He's out on this battlefield.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000 There's all gear and personal effects of all these guys that were killed.
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000 And it's just been sitting there and no one's moved it.
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000 And so he tells the team that he's with, like,
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000 okay, so it goes to start round and up the gear, and anyone will do it.
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000 And if you're looking at them, you became painful to see such reluctance.
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000 I spontaneously got down from my open Jeep, walked up to a pair of pouches,
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000 and a belt, and picked them up, brought them to my Jeep.
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000 And then the Brigadier General that was with him did it as well,
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000 was the next to do so.
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000 It was only after this at the rest of the escort team got down
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000 and gathered the other items,
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000 a little bit of leadership from the front right there.
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:02.000 And I think we're going to close with a section right here.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:14.000 Views and visits have seen your generals, and their interaction with field commanders and troops did little to inspire us subordinates.
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000 Provided little worthwhile guidance and clarified little
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000 as to what the whole game plan was about.
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000 So these guys had no idea of what the why was.
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000 Everybody lived and fought from one day to the next.
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000 No strategic view.
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000 Our wait for pearls of wisdom remained endless.
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000 What increasingly showed up instead was the political eye and bluster of the generals,
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000 the tentativeness and uncertainty of the army commander above them,
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.000 and the army chief, which did little to change systemic in communities
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000 and tackle the hidden rock.
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:13.000 Consequently, boldness and experimentation became prominent casualties.
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:28.000 So this glaring eye from the senior leadership snuffed out the creativity and the boldness of the troops.
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:38.000 They actually made this intense, scrutiny.
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000 Like I said, it made the troops not want to do anything.
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:53.000 And I think not only should you keep that in consideration as a leader that you make sure that you're not snuffing out creativity from your troops,
01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:07.000 but also on a personal level, you can't let the fear of failure limit your boldness and your experimentation.
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000 And that's something that happens all the time. People are afraid to step out and try something new.
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:24.000 Yeah, and I mentioned this before, where a lot of the time the reason for that is when people get punished for making honest mistakes.
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000 You definitely should not punish people for making honest mistakes.
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:36.000 And when you are going to take risks yourself, you need to cut yourself some slack and realize that things might not go perfect.
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:43.000 And I'll tell you, I mean, another example that's sitting right in front of us right now is this podcast that we're doing.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:51.000 Because people are asking, you know, hey, you should do a podcast, but there's, you know, okay, well, where's it going to go?
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000 Do we really want to do it? What's the, what do people actually going to think of it?
01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:03.000 You know, it's one thing to have do a podcast with a guy like Tim Ferriss or Joe Rogan or Sam Harris where you've got this, you know,
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000 famous individual and of course people want to listen to them, but who's going to want to listen to Jocco and Echo?
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000 So there's some, you know, let's, but, but, okay, what's the worst thing that's happened?
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000 We fail, no one listens to it, okay, cool, it wasn't going to affect me that bad.
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000 You know, we'd move on and figure something else to do.
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000 But that's the kind of thing that that experimentation that can lead to good stuff.
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:43.000 And if you don't allow yourself to do that, then you're going to have problems. And the same way, if you don't allow your troopers to make mistakes like you said and try new things and you don't encourage that, then they're going to be,
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000 their morale is going to be crushed and they're not going to make the progress that they need to do need to make.
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000 Yeah, I mean, you can kind of look at that type of scenario.
01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:07.000 Or from like an expanded point of view, like the big picture where if someone's not raised, I kind of mentioned this before as well, where if someone is raised in a really rigid household where, you know, the,
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000 the kid who's taking piano lessons, he makes one wrong key and he gets whacked with a ruler, right?
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000 And let's say someone was just raised like that in like every little mistake.
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000 They're going to be so reluctant to start something new.
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000 They're going to be so scared and a lot of times you don't even feel like you know why you're scared.
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000 It's just just scary.
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:39.000 A lot of anxiety comes when you think about or consider branching out doing something new, fear of failure and all this is so embedded in you because of that punishment that you received.
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:46.000 So you're trained, you know, you're trained to avoid mistakes or new stuff that you might make.
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:54.000 And that's something we've dealt with in the military for the last several years, last probably a couple decades was this, we, we called the zero defect mentality.
01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.000 And where's like, okay, if this, if this guy made any mistakes over his career, he was not going to be advanced, he was not going to be promoted.
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:12.000 And they've really tried to move away from that because like you said that completely suffocates any type of risk taken any type of creativity, any willingness to go outside the box and try something new, it just suffocates it.
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.000 Yeah, so I was definitely never a person that would hammer people from making mistakes as long as they were, we'll call them good mistakes, right?
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000 Just not just making stupid mistakes.
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000 Yeah, we're being careless and I don't want you to know being careless is bad.
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:39.000 Yeah, so that kind of wraps up the book assignment, Jaffna, I, I started to pan, Ponday, great book and I don't know if you can get a hold of it.
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000 But those are some major lessons that I learned from it.
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000 And again, I bought this book while I was in Sri Lanka and read it and it definitely influenced me.
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:57.000 And as I started fighting a counter-insurgency war myself, I would think about what they went through and how difficult it was for them.
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000 And I knew we would be facing some very difficult times as well.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000 Yeah, that's interesting how that is essentially,
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:16.000 I'm going to big way the opposite of your book, where he's, this is basically a cautionary tale from beginning to end, just how not to do it.
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:25.000 Yeah, and although, and you know from from our book, our book has a lot of, this was a mistake that we made, here's what we did wrong.
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:41.000 Now, strategically overall, it was a very successful, you know, what the army did and what the one one AD did and what the two two eight, what all these soldiers and Marines did over a longer period of time with us seals as well, was successful overall.
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:50.000 But we definitely point out the errors of our way because there's successful operations outlined in this book as well, but you don't learn as much from.
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000 Yeah, I picked out a couple of the other ones that went wrong because of course you learn more from your mistakes.
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:07.000 Yeah. And you know, in the book that late for my wrote, it's definitely a lot of those stories about the mistakes we made because we learned more from them as brutal as that is that's the reality.
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000 Yeah, that's all.
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:22.000 Before we get in the questions, I do want to say if I did this pronounce incorrectly pronounced anything from assignment, Jeff, no, I sincerely apologize.
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000 So, my boss, I'm sorry.
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:35.000 So with that, we'll go into some questions from the interwebs.
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:51.000 This question from geekin dad, juggle willing. How do you deal with fatigue both mental and physical?
01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:11.000 How do I deal with fatigue, mental and physical? I rest. And you know, when, when if I'm feeling like just completely overtrained and weak, I usually tell, well, I tell my fighters, I'd say, hey, you just got your butt kick today.
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:29.000 Go eat a big steak tonight, take tomorrow off. You just need rest. And it's pretty obvious when that happens. And so I do the same thing for myself. If I'm feeling horrible and you know, you can see occasionally my workouts is consistent like, you know, doing some mobility training rolling it out.
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:37.000 You know, doing a big stretch. That's because I'm just tired and I know it. And so I just give myself some downtime.
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:47.000 I think it's very important to know the difference between being lazy and being overtrained. And it's very easy to make that excuse for yourself.
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:56.000 And that's why I always air on the side of I'm working out. I'm training because and usually then the next day.
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:07.000 So if I feel like exhausted today, I won't take today off, but I will take the next step. But I work out today just to make sure that it's not just being lazy.
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:13.000 So I'll do another workout, get another training session in or whatever the case may be. So I make sure that's not just that moment.
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000 Because sometimes the next day you're like, you know, I'm not that bad. Right. I'm going to get him back in the game.
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:29.000 Back on the program. The the other thing people ask me all the time. I've probably written this a dozen times or more on Twitter is do I take naps and the answer is yes.
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000 In fact, I slept on the I flew today and I slept probably two hours on the plane.
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.000 And that's a little bit more than an app and I'm not going to play in every day. So what do I do for naps? Yes, I do take naps.
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:51.000 What I do for naps is something that I learned from a high school teacher that I had was I walked into his office one day and he had his feet up on the desk above his heart.
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000 And I said, what are you doing? And he said, oh, this is really good for you. Put your feet above your heart.
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:05.000 And it allows the blood to circulate out of your feet and gives, you know, let's your your veins and your one way valves and your veins rest a little bit.
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:12.000 And it gets a little pools of blood out of random places and it's good and it's good. And so I tried it and it felt really good.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:20.000 And so when I was going through sea of training, I used to when I come in we have a couple minutes between evolutions and I just go in and put my feet up.
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:35.000 I want to go out sleep for a few minutes, you know, nowadays if I can, I'll try and sleep for like six to eight minutes. Set my timer on my iPhone and you look like distressed when I said six to eight minutes.
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000 Yeah, you don't consider anything under the three hours to be.
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000 Yeah, that's not legitimate now.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000 But if I sleep for like an hour, then I'm up for too long at night. I won't be able to go to sleep too much rest.
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000 Gotcha.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000 Yeah.
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000 Under what circumstances are you going to take a nap though? Like how do you just tell?
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000 I'm just tired off feeling myself like now. Oh, yes, like sleepy tired.
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000 And that's the thing is I can do if I'm a, if my mind is engaged in something or especially my body is engaged in something.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000 That's what's cool about working out. You can work out when you're exhausted because once you start moving to something you're going to fall sleep while you're doing squats.
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000 Right. Like you fall sleep while you're doing pull ups.
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000 Yeah. You're just going to do the pull ups. You're just going to do this squats. And when you get down you'll be tired. You're going to sleep.
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000 Right. What's hard to do? And this is when like when we were writing the book when I was writing my section of the books.
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000 I'd be writing a night, 11 o'clock at night, 12 o'clock at night, be trying to hammer through it.
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000 And sometimes it just falls, you know, be falling asleep.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000 Oh, man.
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000 So, but that feeling of ham just falling asleep.
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000 That's not good.
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000 Yeah.
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:38.000 So when I'm feeling that tired, all pounded. I put it's like one of those things where I also like to push through it.
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:45.000 So, sometimes just trying power through it because honestly even even a short nap for me will kind of make me stay up too late at night.
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000 And all of a sudden, we want to clock them all in a minute.
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:47.000 Yeah.
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000 You've been at six to eight minutes.
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000 Six to eight minutes.
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000 Six to eight minutes. A pound up. A six to eight minute pound up can make you feel amazing.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000 Oh, yeah.
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000 It can make you feel amazing.
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000 Don't underestimate the power to up.
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000 It is a legit fool right there.
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000 Yeah.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:23:59.000 Yeah.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000 I actually used to take like 15 minutes.
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000 Yeah.
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:03.000 Yeah.
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000 15 minutes.
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:04.000 Yeah.
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000 I know that's over here for you.
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000 That's a little much going into laziness.
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000 No, seriously.
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000 15 minutes is, yeah, you probably felt like, yeah.
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000 Outstanding.
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000 But it only helps with that sleepy type because let's say I'm used to a certain amount of sleep.
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000 Let's say get two and a half hours less sleep than I'm used to.
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000 It goes way beyond me feeling just sleepy tired.
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000 It's like physically tired.
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000 Oh, really?
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:26.000 Yeah.
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000 So,
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:27.000 Yeah.
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000 I don't have that issue.
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000 Yeah.
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.000 Yeah.
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000 That's your different.
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000 So, if I take a ten minute power nap one night.
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000 And I'm lacking two and a half hours of my ponenquilting.
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000 Oh, we'll make up for it right?
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000 No.
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:40.000 No.
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000 No.
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:41.000 No.
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000 No.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000 It helps me when I get my normal sleep you ever take.
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000 But I've been doing a lot of stuff during the day.
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000 You know?
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000 And you're like, dang, I did a lot.
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000 My brain was kind of used a lot.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000 And dang I have this.
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000 Whatever I got to do now.
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000 Yeah.
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000 Then you take the 10, 15 minute nap ten.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000 It brings you right back.
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000 Yeah.
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000 And it typically will not mess with me.
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000 I wonder how much of this is just you just not just.
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000 Just powering through stuff.
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000 Yeah.
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000 Probably all of it.
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000 But nonetheless, that's how it is for me.
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000 For sure.
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000 It'd be interesting to at some point for you to experiment with like lack of sleep and sleep
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000 That you're patient and see how well you can perform.
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000 Like I've been noticing that where I don't get a lot of sleep.
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000 I can still perform really well.
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000 Yeah.
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000 At some physical activities.
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000 And then after a few days though, I do, I do feel like garbage.
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000 Right.
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000 And then we some physical activities that I'll feel just a week at.
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000 But yeah.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000 And you're right.
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000 Well, there are the, I mean as long as it's like one time or even two times or
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000 it.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000 So if I film or something and let's say I film in the morning, but then I've been working
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000 late the night before.
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000 When I go into film, I'm like charged up.
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000 I'm sure there's all kinds of factors in there.
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000 A lot of it's like adrenaline.
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000 Not like it's like this huge adrenaline rush.
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000 But there's that little bit of adrenaline because of the task.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000 You know, so that helps.
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000 And a lot of times just like how you said, if I made the decision like, no, I'm not going to miss this workout at all under any circumstances.
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000 Then I happen to get two and a half hours less sleep than I.
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000 And I go in and I how you say power through it.
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000 You can totally do it.
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000 Yeah.
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000 But I'm seeking comfort fully for sure.
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000 But it still does help though.
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000 But dance the question.
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000 Yes.
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000 If you're tired, sleep.
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000 Mm-hmm.
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000 If you need rest rest.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:28.000 Right.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000 And don't try and over train yourself.
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000 You probably are over training and just need some rest.
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000 Yeah.
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000 Next.
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000 Um.
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000 We don't have an author on this one.
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000 But um, what are your thoughts on freakishly strong guys in BJJ?
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000 Who go too hard.
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000 Get hurt and pain it as if it's your fault.
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000 Cause it's got rolled with the maniac tonight.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000 The guy that rolled with the maniac.
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000 So we've all been there.
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000 We're rolling with the maniac.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000 Okay.
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000 So this is a.
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000 This seems like a pretty straightforward question at first.
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000 But then all of a sudden it gets really complicated.
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000 It really does.
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000 Who is it fault here?
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000 Right.
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000 So you're wrong with the guy.
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000 Guys, super strong.
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000 You catch him in the submission.
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000 And guess what?
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000 He doesn't want to tap.
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000 And so the next thing you know, there's a little pop.
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000 There's a little crack.
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000 And you've got an injury and the big guy that was going all crazy.
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000 So I can't believe you did this.
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000 So a question is who's it fault?
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000 And there's actually two science to that story.
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000 And a lot of ways because.
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000 In from one.
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000 In one way the higher belt, right, or a more experienced guy.
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000 Should never really hurt a lower belt, right?
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000 I mean, if if I'm a black belt and I'm going to get super about.
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000 I really shouldn't hurt that person because if I do.
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000 I probably meant to do it.
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000 I mean, of course, there's, you know, mistakes happen.
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000 And I'm not talking, I'm talking about submission, right?
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.000 I'm not talking about, hey, I, I, I went over and it made you roll your ankle or you caught your wrist as you were falling out or something like that.
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000 Those are just incidents, incidental, you know, things that happen in GJ2.
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:20.000 But, you know, so the, so the higher belt generally shouldn't be like putting someone in a submission and hurting them because
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:27.000 experience guys and GJ2, they know when the tension is there on the arm or the foot or the knee.
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:36.000 They know that that tension means the next amount of pressure is going to take this beyond the limit of the joint and they're going to have an injury.
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000 So either big guy, he's going psycho and he's got a big ego.
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000 And that's why he's not tapping.
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000 So so that must be his fault, right?
01:28:47.000 --> 01:29:09.000 Well, at the same time, if someone doesn't tap and then you hurt them, well, that's kind of jacked up too because you shouldn't be getting someone's foot and cranking it or getting their arm and cranking it when you know,
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000 I mean, maybe they couldn't tap, maybe they were almost stuck or whatever, now we'll suddenly hurt them.
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000 So I really do think it's both, I think both people aren't fault.
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000 Yeah.
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:27.000 And I think that part of the dual safety mechanisms is GJ2 is that there's two people that control the situation.
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000 But one that's getting submitted should tap and the one that's doing this submission should, you know,
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000 should know to stop before the injury occurs.
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000 Again, there's about a million little things that can happen where you're going to introduce your GJ2.
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000 Our mox that get thrown on and it's a little tweak and and that stuff does happen.
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000 But when I look at Dean and I Dean Lester who's in my main training partner have been training with for 20 years,
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:59.000 we've put thousands, literally thousands and thousands of submissions on each other.
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000 And neither one of us has ever hurt the other one.
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000 And neither one of us has ever gotten hurt from a submission.
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:13.000 But I'm talking thousands of submission. Of course most of those, you know, many of those, most of those are him submitting me.
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000 But I mean, I've submitted him many, many times as well.
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000 And never have one of us got a submission on the other one.
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:29.000 And hurt, you know, the person and I can tell you, he's let go of hundreds of submissions on me.
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:36.000 And I've let go on many submissions on him because I go, you know what, oh, I've got this.
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000 He's, you know, he's not tapping for wherever reason would go to the next move.
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000 Or he gets me in some weird position. He, you know, he's got it, but he's let's go and go to the next move.
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000 And what's really cool about this is what you end up with is you end up with an ego free training.
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.000 Because the truth of the matter is, I don't care if Dean taps me.
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:05.000 And I don't care if I tap Dean. Like, and he doesn't care if he taps me and he doesn't care if he gets the tap from me.
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:12.000 So what we are able to do then is take all kinds of risks and do all kinds of crazy flow drills and and where we're really trying to get each other.
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000 But at the same time, we really don't care.
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.000 And, and the biggest dichotomy of that is, I'm sitting here saying, I don't want to get tapped.
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000 You know, I don't care if I get tapped by Dean, but it drives me crazy when I get tapped by Dean.
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.000 He tries me crazy. You can hear you're like, someone's a gym on me like, I get frustrated because I got tapped.
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.000 But it's frustrated at myself and it's frustration in the game and whatever, but it's not.
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000 It's not my ego being like, I didn't want to tap.
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000 It's just a frustration that I made a mistake or whatever.
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:48.000 So that allows you to really learn more.
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000 Now, all this being said, if someone's just a big maniac that goes crazy the whole time and they're going to hurt you,
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000 well, then you got to make a decision that you're not going to roll with them.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000 I mean, clearly, you want to not get hurt.
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000 You want to continue training.
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000 So someone that's that goes crazy and is super strong.
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000 You don't want to roll with them.
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000 That being said, and this whole thing has been a non-answerism.
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000 That being said, because when you do that, you've got to understand that you're avoiding a real issue.
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000 You're avoiding a big strong guy and how you're going to deal with that guy.
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000 And you will get better dealing with the big strong guy.
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000 That's what makes you, that's one of the key things to get you better at you, too.
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:37.000 So, you know, you want to train with a big strong guy.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000 But that being said, once again, is if you train with a big guy and you get hurt, then you can't train anymore.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000 So you've got to be smart.
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000 You've got to use your judgment.
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000 You've got to check your ego.
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000 You've got to roll with people that have their ego's checked.
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000 And I think that's the best way to answer.
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000 That's a long answer. It's probably not the most complete answer.
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:05.000 But there is no clear cut answer because there's a lot of little nuances to every little role in the GJ2.
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:12.000 Yeah, it seems like there's so many exceptions to all these situations even when you say a higher belt.
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000 Should never hurt a lower belt.
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000 A lot of times, I can just depend.
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000 Like, what if you're not that much higher and he's bigger than you, more athletic.
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.000 And when you go for a submission, really control, or whatever he's spashing the whole time.
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000 So even in your transitions, he's spashing, he's spashing.
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:36.000 So really, the only way you can get that submission is if you go fast and hard to get it.
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000 It's like getting slapped right on, right?
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.000 And let's say you do it in the midst of your arm bar, you had in the midst of you slapping it on.
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000 You kind of extended too much for me, hurt him.
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000 Yeah.
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:52.000 It's really just the nature of the role. And a lot of times, it's nobody's fault. That's just how two guys go in crazy.
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000 Who care about the submissions they're getting.
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000 It happens.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000 But yeah, you shouldn't care about so much about the submission you're getting. That's the bottom line.
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:10.000 Well, unless and Greg brought this up where he said, you should care about the submissions you get.
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000 And you should care about being able to resist the missions as well because it's kind of your response.
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:24.000 And this was, this would understand the context we're talking. We're talking about like me and him and the guys that that I was talking about was I was rolling with.
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000 He said, it's your job to give them an accurate look.
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000 If you're a big guy who's, you know, you come in and you're, you know, however big and athletic.
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000 You have to give them that look and you have a certain skill level and you just say you got to give them that look.
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000 So you provide an accurate experience of rolling with a guy who's, you know,
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000 250 pounds brown belt. You have to give it that.
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000 Yeah, no, that's true. So we say you can't go easy.
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:57.000 You can't go easy. You can't, he's not saying you can't. He's saying that, but if you put on a submission and that guy's not tapping, he's just giving you an accurate look.
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000 That your submission isn't submitting him. You're not submitting him. You're not tapping him out.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000 And if he's tough and likes a pain or is not scared of the pain, well, that's the look he's giving you.
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.000 So you have to complete the move. If you're not going to break his arm, if you have that, that mindset.
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000 That's good too, but then you have to work on other situations that you would do in that situation.
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:21.000 So if you want to just control the fight more or something like that, then that's what you got to do.
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000 But it is, it's up to give you that look.
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:31.000 That is something that Dean and I will do that I think is awesome is let's say Dean puts a heel hook on me.
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:37.000 And instead of cranking it and making me tap, he'll hold it.
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000 Yeah, and when he holds it, it gives me an opportunity to work some kind of escape.
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:51.000 Now, sometimes he'll hold it and while he's holding it, he's adjusting his legs and he's actually getting me deeper and deeper into where I can't get out anymore.
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:58.000 And eventually, I realize I can't move and tap, not because of the pressure, not because of the pain because I realize it's checkmate in the game over.
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:06.000 The same token is, as he's holding it, if I can figure out, I have time to think and consider and go, oh, what if I put my foot here, what if I grab this arm here,
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.000 what if I spin this way or that way, and all of a sudden a real escape opens up, but I had time to think about it.
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000 Well, maybe next time I do it, I don't have to think and now we actually have figured out and escape from the position.
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000 Yeah.
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:26.000 And, and or either I figured out an escape or maybe he figured out the way to finish it with 100% reliability.
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:34.000 So we actually have advanced, that's probably the original advancement in the leglock game for Dean and me was,
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:44.000 and really, for Dean, more than me was him holding a submission and not allowing me to try different things to escape and shutting them down.
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000 And then eventually, we're like, okay, now I've got your position where there is no escape.
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:55.000 And that's how things like we end up with like the four or eleven and no to me game overall, that stuff came from holding those positions,
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000 because if he just locked him on and cranked it, well then I tap and then we start again, but he didn't have to adjust anything.
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.000 And now you start building technique on top of technique on top of technique.
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000 Next question.
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000 And I'm quoting this here.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:19.000 Please, can I have some advice with dealing or please, can I have some advice for dealing with poor leaders at work?
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000 They have little respect for and the question.
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:33.000 As a subordinate, how do you handle a leader who leads from a place of ego and isn't transparent with information?
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000 Yeah, so these were a couple of questions actually that I got.
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.000 And I just kind of bunched them together because my answer is going to be very similar for each of them.
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:50.000 And it's actually very similar to a situation that I'm dealing with right now with a kind of helping out.
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000 And I wrote something to him recently.
01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:05.000 And what happened was he's in a situation where a leader had come in that didn't have the knowledge inside the industry they were working in.
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000 So he came from another industry, got put into a leadership position.
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:18.000 And that guy that new leader was resisting change and not giving support to the new procedures that the guy I was coaching was trying to implement.
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000 So he was kind of, you know, at a loss for what to do.
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000 You know, you got this new manager that's coming in that's inexperienced.
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:35.000 And the guy I'm coaching obviously doesn't respect him because he doesn't have a lot of knowledge in this industry.
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000 And so here's the advice I gave.
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:44.000 I said, you need to set this up to make the new manager look good.
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000 Make some adjustments to the words you are choosing the tact you are taking.
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:56.000 And the focus you are using to ensure that your changes make him look good, not bad.
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000 Now this is so counterintuitive for people.
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000 It's so counterintuitive because they get that person that's above them, the chain of command that doesn't know as much as them that's not as smart as them.
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000 And what do they want to do? They want to bring them down.
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000 They want to prove to everybody that they're better.
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000 I'm better than that guy.
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000 I deserve that guy's job. That's what everybody's instinct is to do.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000 And it's wrong. It's wrong.
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:29.000 Somehow let the ideas come from him or make him the approver or the driver of some of the S aspects that he can handle.
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000 So I'm actually saying go out of your way to make this easier for this guy.
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000 Make him look good. Give him credit.
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:43.000 It's your ego that wants to pull him down. Put your ego in check.
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.000 Help him without being condescending or acting like you know more than him.
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000 He shouldn't even know you are helping him.
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:59.000 If you've been, this is so fun to do is when echo doesn't know this section of the equipment.
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000 So I don't say, hey, since you don't know this, I'll teach it to you.
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.000 Right? This condescending tone of you know, but instead of like, hey,
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000 have you ever seen the way this one works? I know you've ever seen this specific equipment before.
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000 Because the way it works, it's a little bit different than some of the other ones.
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.000 You got to do this and this and you can sit back and you can accept that knowledge without feeling like you don't know it.
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000 So I'm teaching you, but I'm doing it in a clandestine manner.
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000 And that's what we're trying to do because we're trying to build.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000 We're trying to do what's trying to build a relationship here.
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000 That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to build a relationship.
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000 And if I go, since you don't know how to use this, I'll show you now.
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000 What does that do? Put you on the defensive makes you consider to me to be a threat.
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000 Now I'm threatening. And that's not good.
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000 He should even know you are helping him.
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000 Respect what he does and show him that you respect it.
01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.000 So, you know, I know this is, you probably haven't been down the weeds on this type of gear in a while,
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000 but hey, this is the way you don't understand.
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000 Like, you actually respect the fact that you're up top in charge.
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000 And I'm just a frontline guy, but here's how you do this if you ever add to it.
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000 Right. You know what I mean?
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000 Just downplay what he doesn't know and subtly help him to learn it.
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000 Right? You know, you probably wouldn't ever have to do this.
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000 This new equipment over here.
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000 I mean, I know it's a little bit below your level.
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000 Here's how it works if you ever needed it.
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000 You don't admit, not like you don't know how to do this.
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:37.000 How do you do? You don't want an adversarial relationship with this new leader.
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000 You want him to support and help you.
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000 He will do that if you are making him look good.
01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000 This is so easy, man.
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000 This is so easy and so hard because everybody's ego will get in the way.
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000 Everybody's ego will get in the way.
01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:01.000 Extreme ownership often requires covert and clandestine indirect actions.
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:07.000 So all these things that I'm talking about helping the guy without him knowing,
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.000 letting him take credit for ideas without him knowing.
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000 All these little aspects, they're indirect actions.
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000 They're not going to head to head. It's like you're just too.
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000 It's just too all the time. Everything's just too.
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000 You don't want to, if you know I'm going to do an arm bar, I'm not going to get the arm bar.
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000 You're going to defend that.
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.000 So I have to go take indirect actions and set things up and take my time and be clandestine and covert.
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000 This is chess, not checkers.
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000 This is where you need to master your ability to influence,
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000 which as we talked about in a couple of podcasts, go as actually manipulation.
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000 I'm manipulating this guy to think that he's got something over me.
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000 I'm inflading his ego while I'm putting my ego in check.
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000 I'm making him feel like he's even better.
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000 And that makes him feel good. It makes him want to support me because I make him look good.
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000 This is just basic.
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.000 If you do this wrong, the new manager will resist you at every turn.
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.000 If you do this right, he will be your biggest supporter.
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000 Now, this is the same thing with leaders that you quote and quote don't respect.
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000 First of all, there should be something that you respect about everybody.
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000 Everybody that you meet, you should have some kind of respect for them.
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000 And by the way, if you don't respect someone, what is making you not respect them?
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000 It's your ego. It's your ego that makes you not respect people.
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000 Did you think, oh, I'm better than them, I should have their job.
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000 They don't know what they're talking about and I do.
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000 That's all ego.
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000 So put your ego in check and just be like, okay, this person's above me.
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000 They seem to like experience, but what kind of learn from them?
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000 How did they get there?
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000 If they're so dumb and bad at this job, how come they outrank me?
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000 Let me learn something from them.
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000 Let me learn something from them.
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000 Put your ego in check.
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000 And this is the key point.
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000 And anytime I talk about quote unquote leading up the chain of command,
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000 I will talk about this that no matter what boss I work for and I work for every different kind of boss.
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000 ego maniacs, psychopaths, wonderful guys, intelligent guys, brilliant guys, tacticians.
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.000 I work for every different kind of boss and I always had the same relationship with all of them.
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000 That was my job was to build that relationship and that was a relationship of high trust.
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000 So they trusted me, they were to stay out of my way, let me do what I wanted.
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000 And that's how you win, which by the way, when you win, they should never know you win.
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.000 They shouldn't even know that there was a competition happening.
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000 And that way you can do what you want.
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:59.000 And so that is how you deal with people above you and the chain of command that you have a little respect for or that lead from a place of ego.
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000 You build a relationship with them.
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000 You don't go head to head with them, you're not going to win, go ahead to head with your boss.
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000 There you're boss, they have rank on you.
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000 If they're an ego maniac, they're going to use that rank.
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.000 If there's someone that you don't respect, you got to build a relationship with them.
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000 If there's someone that's an ego maniac, you got to build a really regardless of the situation.
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000 The solution is the same.
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000 Build the relationship of trust, help them build them up.
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000 Take a back seat, let them get credit. It's all those things.
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:43.000 And once you do that, you're going to have much better results than if you're trying to bang heads with them, overcome them, defeat them, have an antagonistic relationship with them.
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000 It's never going to work.
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000 So play the game.
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000 You've been lifting heavy weights for many years.
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000 Indeed, sir.
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:04.000 Now that you're in your mid 40s, are you still seeing gains in strength and muscle?
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000 Well, yes, I am.
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:14.000 And as a matter of fact, I think one of the key kind of measurements of this is only a couple years ago.
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000 I set my personal all-time record for pull-ups.
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000 A couple years ago, maybe a year or two ago.
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000 So you did you do 63?
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000 Yeah.
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:32.000 So, but that being said, obviously you're going to go up and down.
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.000 So, and you don't, you can't continually set records on a daily basis.
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000 So what do I do and what's driving me?
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:46.000 So what I do is I'm constantly kind of going from goal to goal to goal.
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000 And I get on a path where I'm trying to do something.
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:55.000 I'll get into something, I'll read an article, or I'll see something, and I'll go, that looks cool.
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000 That looks hard.
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000 That looks like a challenge.
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000 Or I don't think I could do that, but I'm going to try.
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000 Right.
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000 You know, so I'll say, okay, you know what?
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000 Man, I haven't deadlift heavy in a while, I'm going to get my 500 pound deadlift on.
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000 And so I'll just start focusing on the deadlift.
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000 And that's a bit of deadlift in every day, but I'm dead starting to go heavy.
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.000 Right.
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000 Really working it, I'm starting to, all my, you know, maybe I'll be deadlifting a little more often.
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000 I'll throw it in another day.
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:31.000 And I'll maybe I'll stop a little bit of that sprinting or a little bit of that high rep stuff.
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000 And I just start, you know, spending more time deadlifting.
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000 And after a while, you know, maybe a month goes by, month and a half.
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000 And I get where I want to be.
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000 So I get, I let's say I get to 500.
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000 You know, 500 deadlift feeling good.
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000 Now, I could say, you know what?
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000 I won't even get 525, right?
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000 I could say that.
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000 Yeah.
01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:00.000 But if you think about what I'm going to have to do and anybody that lifts weights at all knows that the difference like the higher you go.
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000 The, the hargard is to increase a little bit more.
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000 And really, what, what are you getting out of that?
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000 Like, like, in the real world, big picture, what are you getting out of it?
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000 What are you getting out of an extra?
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000 You got 500 pounds.
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000 You can deadlift.
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000 What are you getting out of an extra 25 pounds?
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000 Yeah.
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000 The answer is, the answer is not a lot.
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:27.000 You know, the answer is no one will ever know the difference between you at 500 pound deadlift and you at 520 or 25.
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000 No one's going to know that difference when they roll with you.
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000 When they look at you, they're not going to know.
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.000 And you will have to sacrifice other parts of your physicality in order to get there.
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000 You're going to be slower at real sprinting.
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:48.000 You're probably going to be heavier so you're going to be able to do less calisthenic workouts or less less repetitions in calisthenics.
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000 So I'll get there.
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000 And then once I get to like that good goal that I'm looking for, then I'll just shift to another goal.
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000 I'll start looking at something else.
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:06.000 And, you know, whatever it's going to be a certain number of, you know, a 20 reps squat routine at a certain weight.
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000 I'll start heading towards that or a certain number of muscle ups in a certain number of times.
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000 Whatever the case may be, I'll do that.
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000 And that's what I've been doing for many, many years.
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:24.000 And I never go so far down one path and become so specific that it takes away a bunch from the other areas.
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.000 Because at the end of the day, you know, I want to be well rounded.
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.000 Yeah, I think that's, that's a mature.
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000 I would say that's a mature pursuit right there.
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.000 Because when you're young, you want to, I mean, not you like everyone, but I'm just saying it's pretty general.
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000 Pretty typical that when you're young, you want to get.
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.000 You said these not want to bench them most I can possibly bench and you'll go or the dead left for example.
01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000 If you get 500 when you're younger, you want to get that 2525.
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000 Yeah, you want to get that 535.
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000 You want to get that 555. And you don't really see it the big picture.
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000 You don't see that that not only yeah, you're going to have to spend so much effort just to get that little gains,
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000 which no one's going to be able to tell unless you're going to competition.
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000 Something like that is different.
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:20.000 But not only are you spending that much time, you're avoiding time.
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000 You could be spending developing other aspects of your fitness.
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000 If you're talking about working out.
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000 So I fell into this, and yeah, fell into the same thing about a year ago.
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:37.000 When I was never really into conditioning in the gym, you know, like muscular conditioning and metabolic conditioning, never into that.
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000 But once you do that, you find that thing.
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000 There's so many gains I can achieve doing this type of stuff.
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000 When you know, you achieve the gains when I was young lifting weights and getting this big bench or big muscles or whatever.
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000 But when you're talking about like your physical body and fitness and stuff,
01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:04.000 you know, gains in strength and muscle, there's almost endless ways you can develop strength and muscle.
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000 Or physical conditioning, you mean physically.
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:15.000 Yeah, so strength and strength is, I mean, I know strength is defined, but really when you kind of talk about strength, that's like a general term.
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000 Like you can even say his distance running is strong.
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000 Like he has a strong effect of his game or whatever.
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000 That's not true.
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.000 He just struggles or usually knocks strong.
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000 Yeah, but we'll just say his game is strong.
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000 Just so conditioning.
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000 Yeah, it's good.
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000 It's good.
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000 It's like just what you call it.
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:42.000 But either way, gains it in general, you know, and the more elements of physicality you have developed, the better off you're going to be.
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000 Absolutely.
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:50.000 So yeah, if you, if you, so a lot of times when they talk about gains in strength and muscle, that means the numbers, yeah,
01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000 500 and now I'm getting five, you know, I'm 40 now.
01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:03.000 And I still getting gains in strength and muscle, but there's so many other gains to get in all kinds of different physical activities.
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000 And like I said, that's the mature way to pursue it is to pursue all those things.
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000 And set a cool goal.
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000 And when the diminishing returns start to come about, then you shift your goal.
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000 Again, and then at the end of the day, you're going to end up the day.
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:29.000 But the big picture of what you're going to end up with is this fully developed physicality that applies to way more things in life than they would if you're just trying to get that bench up or that deadlift up.
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000 So yeah, you're, you're, you're pursued.
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000 That's, that's, that's a very eye-opening thing.
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000 I think I fell into it, but the way you put it, I think that's very important,
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:44.000 especially when you start to get older, you know, when functioning overall is more important.
01:52:44.000 --> 01:53:01.000 This is not something that I just started doing. I got older when we were young in the seal teams, we would do this. We'd be like, all right, we're going to get to bench 300 once we were benching 300, we'd say, all right, we're going to go and we'd be doing things like, hey, we're going to do the six mile run and extra time that we get that we'd say, oh, we're going to do 50 pull ups and then we get to that.
01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000 So we've been doing this for a while.
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:08.000 Yeah, and I think that, yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of people that actually conduct themselves like that.
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:15.000 I know Tim Ferriss, kind of does that, and just even more so than Justin exercise just in a lot of in life. You know, he'll do that, he'll set a goal, he'll experience it,
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:22.000 or, and then he'll shift it and do something else. And there's guys who, they kind of devote their life as almost like a hobby,
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000 but just a part of their life will build every year, they'll take on something new.
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000 That would like, I'm going to learn the guitar just this whole year, and then next year is something else or whatever.
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.000 Yeah, and more so than, I'm not necessarily saying that I think it comes with age.
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000 I'm just saying that's a mature way to, to get gains.
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000 It's a smart way to run your life.
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:48.000 Yes, yes, very smart.
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:56.000 So next question, okay, you talk about people becoming aware as a leader.
01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000 When did you become aware as a leader?
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.000 I think I've actually told this story before, but it was pretty clear memory to me.
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:12.000 I was doing I was a young, seal, probably in my first or second. It was actually my second platoon,
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000 and we were taking down an oil rig.
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:22.000 And oil rigs are very complicated. There's a lot of, there's different levels to the oil rigs,
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000 and you can see through all the levels, because the floors are just made of great, basically.
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:37.000 So you can see multiple different directions, 360 degrees, and there's all kinds of gear and equipment all over the different levels.
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000 So it can be pretty complicated. Anyways, we came up onto this level, so I'm going to seal platoon,
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:48.000 and we got 15 or 20 guys, and we come up onto this level, and everyone spreads out in a line,
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000 and we're looking at the level, and there's all kinds of complex stuff in front of us.
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000 And we're trying to clear it, you know, you're looking for bad guys or whatever.
01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000 Again, this is just training, and as we're looking at everyone kind of freezes,
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000 because there's so much complexity out there that everyone just kind of freezes.
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.000 Just because the physical layout, just the physical layout, it's just confusing and it looked confusing.
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:16.000 And complex, and so as I stood there, everyone froze.
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:24.000 And as everyone froze, I basically came offline and put my gun to high port,
01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:32.000 and I said, hold left move right. So I was able to step back, look around, assess a good solution for the situation.
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000 And once I assess the situation, I just called out, what to do?
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000 I said, hold left move right, which basically the guys on the left, stay where you're at,
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000 the guys on the right, we're going to move and do the clearance, and the guys did it.
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:50.000 And I realized right then, you know, like, wow, I can, I can kind of, I think I got this.
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000 And it wasn't, then I didn't all of a sudden start trying to take charge of everything,
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000 because in the SEAL teams, you can't just, as a new guy, step up and start taking charge of stuff,
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000 you know, you'll get put in your place.
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:05.000 But I had that vision, and the vision that I actually had was that vision of the attachment,
01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:11.000 the vision of coming offline and stepping out of the tactical situation and realizing that when you step back,
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000 you can see everything, and that was like a miracle to me.
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000 And once I realized that, it was always easy for me to do that from then on, and not only that,
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.000 but it became easy for me to do that in regular life, and other things that I'm doing,
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000 and having conversations and dealing with relationships and making sure I'm not getting dragged down
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:37.000 into these crazy relationships situations, or business situations,
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000 where there's a lot of emotion going on and saying, you know what,
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:51.000 I'm just going to step back and observe this from a better vantage point that's more unbiased.
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:58.000 Next question, what if you don't have a good mentor?
01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.000 So we talk about mentorship and how mentorship is important, and it's good to have mentors,
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000 and I would agree it's good to have mentors, and if you can find them, and you can't always find them.
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000 And so I think this individual that asks this question, what if you don't have a good mentor?
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000 What do you do?
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:22.000 And for me, it actually brings back my memories of when I first got to the seal teams,
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:31.000 because when I first got to the seal teams, it was actually pretty hard to find a good mentor that I looked at and said,
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000 you know, I want to be like that person, and they were going to invest in you.
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000 So it was one thing to say, hey, that guy looks like a bad ass, and I want to be like them.
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000 That was easy.
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:47.000 But to have someone that says, hey, listen, new guy, I'm going to invest in you and you know,
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000 make you into a great seal.
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000 That really wasn't happened.
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:57.000 You know, we had, first of all, the reason, some of the reasons it wasn't happening was because there was guys that were,
01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.000 you were on constant going on deployments, and so it wasn't like someone would grab you and pull you aside.
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:09.000 And when you got in a seal platoon, it became a little bit easier, and you'd usually find somebody that's going to at least take some interest in you.
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:18.000 But the, like the Vietnam guys, they were around, but they were, you know, instructors and, or working in the training department.
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000 So they didn't, you weren't going to see them on a daily basis.
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000 They weren't going to mentor you.
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000 They weren't going to be there for you.
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:32.000 And I'll tell you not only that, but the guys that I went through training with and the guys that I ended up going to my first team with,
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:41.000 we actually wanted to be more hardcore than what we saw.
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000 You know, we actually wanted to take it to another level.
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:51.000 And so to be honest with you, we kind of mentored ourselves.
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:58.000 And we set the standard of what we thought a seal was supposed to be like in our minds,
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:10.000 and we started to act upon it. I mean, I remember we were doing the runs and the swims at the seal team with our full gear.
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.000 So like the guys at the team would be wearing sneakers and a pair of shorts,
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000 and we'd be wearing boots and a rucksack.
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000 And they would be looking at us like we were kind of crazy, you know,
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.000 but that was us kind of mentoring ourselves.
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000 And we did that with everything. You know, we were spending time at the team on the weekends.
01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:34.000 We would inspect each other's gear over and over again and modify it and make sure it's square it away.
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:39.000 And we were constantly trying to learn and teach each other different things.
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:44.000 I remember trying to teach each other about the different radios that they had and different kind of knots that we had learned.
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000 And so we were always just kind of mentoring ourselves.
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:56.000 And so I think, you know, that's the point is that if you can't find a good mentor,
01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000 then you've got to become your own.
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000 And I think with the way the world is now,
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000 it's actually relatively easy to do that.
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.000 I mean, first of all, you can research what you want to be like.
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000 You can figure out who you want to be like,
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000 or maybe it's not who you want to be like,
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:17.000 but what aspects of other humans you can take.
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000 And bring on board.
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000 Now that is something I did with all kinds of seals.
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000 There was all kinds of bad ass seals that I said,
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000 that guy's really good at this.
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000 And I'm going to try and get good at that too.
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000 Or the way that guy acts in this situation is awesome.
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000 And I'm going to try and act that way too.
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000 So it wasn't like I was trying to be like them,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000 but I was at least trying to emulate the best aspects of these different individuals.
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000 And I think there's a lot of examples out there today where you can do that.
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000 You can look for people to emulate.
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000 You can, I mean, on YouTube,
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000 you can basically find out how to do anything.
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000 In fact, you need to be careful that you,
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.000 that you sanity check some of the people that you look into on that.
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000 But I think that key really to mentoring yourself,
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000 it goes back to what we just talked about with detachment.
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000 Because you need to,
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000 if you want to mentor yourself,
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000 you got to be able to look yourself and you got to be able to look yourself in an honest way.
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:21.000 And that means you need to be able to detach yourself and observe yourself from that distant place.
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000 By distant, I mean, three feet.
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000 I mean, just from just outside of inside your own brain.
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.000 And if you detach, you can see where you're making mistakes.
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.000 And you can see what the long range you that you're striving for,
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000 you can see what it's going to take to get there.
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:46.000 And I think that's what, that's what I've done when I haven't had a mentor.
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000 Is I've figured out a way to mentor myself?
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.000 And I think the goals that you set and the path that you draw out
02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:00.000 and you detach yourself so that you can give yourself an honest observation of who you are and how you're doing.
02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.000 And I think that is a good way to handle it.
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000 Good job.
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000 All right.
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000 I think we'll do one more.
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000 Right, last question.
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000 Any thoughts on how to crank up the discipline?
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:29.000 And where does discipline even come from?
02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:34.000 Where does discipline come from?
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.000 Just a classic question and whoever asks that question,
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000 I would say, thank you for asking that question,
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000 where does discipline come from?
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.000 And the answer is actually pretty simple and pretty obvious.
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000 Discipline comes from within.
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000 It's an internal force.
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:08.000 Now sure, of course, you can have discipline imposed on you by some person,
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:16.000 like a drill instructor or like that self-help guru on TV.
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:23.000 But the reality is that type of discipline isn't the real type of discipline that we're talking about.
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000 That discipline isn't as strong.
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:30.000 It won't survive that imposed discipline that someone else is putting on you.
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:43.000 What you're looking for and what you're talking about and what you need is self-discipline.
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000 Self-discipline as the very term implies comes from the self.
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000 It comes from you.
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:59.000 It comes from when you make a decision to be disciplined.
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000 When you make a decision to be better,
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:10.000 when you make a decision to do more and to be more.
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:20.000 Self-discipline comes when you decide that you're going to make a mark on the world.
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:27.000 And if you think that you're not disciplined or you can't be disciplined,
02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:33.000 it's because you haven't yet decided to be disciplined.
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:40.000 It's because you haven't created that discipline yet.
02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:51.000 It's because you haven't become that discipline yet.
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:59.000 So where does discipline come from? It comes from you.
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:08.000 So make the decision, make the commitment, become the discipline,
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:17.000 the discipline, the root quality that will improve every aspect of your life.
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:25.000 And it'll make you better and stronger and smarter and faster and healthier.
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:38.000 And most importantly, it'll make you free.
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.000 And that's pretty much all I've got for tonight.
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:50.000 And if you want to continue this conversation or engage in a conversation,
