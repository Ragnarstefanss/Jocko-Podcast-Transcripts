00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 93 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Wilink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was lucky and blessed to have had the honor to serve in the United States military during a time of war.

3
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I thought alongside US Army soldiers, sailors and Marines on violent battlefields.

4
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And I saw with my own eyes my generation of warriors uphold the proud tradition of the American fighting man.

5
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
America's military has a storied history of bravery, ingenuity and grit.

6
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But it's most important tradition is the tradition of victory.

7
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
America's military wins wars. It is as simple as that.

8
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If our nation deems it morally right and excessively necessary, then our military is unstoppable.

9
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Of course, and rightfully so, the credit for victory is often given to the men on the front lines.

10
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
To those that are taking the fight to our nation's enemies in close combat.

11
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That credit is well deserved.

12
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But it is not the only credit that needs to be bestowed.

13
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Because it is a simple fact that many of the most critical victories in America's history were won not only on distant bloody battlefields,

14
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but were also won right here at home.

15
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
In fact, there are fields and farms.

16
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You see, our ability to produce, to design, grow, build and manufacture has been just important to our nation's victories as our ability to fight.

17
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And throughout history, when Americans marched to war, we marched wearing boots made by American hands.

18
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We wore uniforms that were cut and sewn in factories like this one.

19
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Our body armor, helmets, and weapons have been the products of American work ethic, skill, and determination.

20
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The best planes, ships, and vehicles in the world.

21
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.000
They carry us to war and then support us on the battlefield, they only exist because Americans built them.

22
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Without the American worker, there can be no American soldier.

23
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So, let us never forget that the freedom we cherish so dearly is a gift.

24
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Not only from our American service men and women, but it is also a gift from the American worker.

25
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The American worker, who toils in fields, in factories, in shipyards, and on job sites.

26
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The American worker, who gets up day after day after day, not only to build and create products.

27
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:42.000
But also to build our economy, the strongest economy in the world, which gives us unmasked influence.

28
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And gives our great nation the ability to make the world a better place.

29
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:07.000
With that knowledge, I could not be prouder to stand here today and be a part of this opening.

30
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Not be prouder to be a part of this company, origin, which like America itself.

31
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
We'll succeed because of the power of the American worker.

32
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It will succeed because of the power of American grit.

33
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.000
An origin USA will succeed because of the unmasked power of the American dream.

34
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And I would like to thank all of you, especially America's workforce for making this dream possible.

35
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And that is a speech that I gave today in a town called Farmington Main.

36
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And I was at the opening of the new origin USA factory.

37
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now, as I've been saying, we are now in league with origin USA.

38
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And tonight, I have with me, our new partner and our new friend Pete Roberts, who, as you will see, has shown some pretty incredible fortitude in the business world.

39
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And who I believe is just getting warmed up.

40
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So, Mr. Pete Roberts, founder of Origin USA, Black Belt and Giu Jitsu, by the way.

41
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And also, Black Belt in making things happen.

42
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Welcome to the show, man.

43
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I ordered to be here. Everything you just said, man, just captures everything I feel in my heart and mind for sure.

44
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And here in that speech live was phenomenal.

45
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
You know, it was awesome walking around the factory and meeting people, meeting the workers here.

46
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I mean, we came in and Jill, she was, she was, it's a week of vacation of what she's doing.

47
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
She's in here working.

48
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And you know, just, and I wasn't even really didn't really know what I was going to say,

49
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
but after coming up here, meeting her, seeing the rest of the people grinding to make this happen.

50
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Yeah, I realized that I realized exactly what I was going to say.

51
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I was going to talk about the fact that literally, mental in the battlefield, your, your, your propelled there by American workers.

52
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And that's what this, that's what this represents.

53
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And, you know, we'll get into how all this kind of came together in this kind of perfect storm.

54
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Yeah, we'll get there, but we'll get there in a little while.

55
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Okay.

56
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Because first we got to know a little about a bit about you and your crazy ass, which I say with all, you know, in the most complimentary possible way.

57
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Yeah, man.

58
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So, tell us about just growing up, like, get me from like, birth to high school.

59
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
What was that all about?

60
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Absolutely.

61
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So, and I'll start it in the sport.

62
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
That's, I'm for real.

63
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Real Spartan blood.

64
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
For real.

65
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yeah, I know my, my ass.

66
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
What's your, what's your, because Robert's isn't no angelic, and some Greek actually,

67
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Yeah, mom's in it.

68
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Yeah, she's Greek.

69
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So, and she's clearly Greek, because I'm not clearly Greek.

70
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And she made that buckle a lot today.

71
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Yeah.

72
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
No, I thought she might pull out a Spartan sword at some point.

73
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
It like attacked me.

74
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Yeah.

75
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Which I was the least.

76
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Cool.

77
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And she's pulled out a big thing of buckle.

78
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Yeah.

79
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And it's like sugar coated.

80
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You don't care.

81
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Did you feel guilty of that?

82
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
No.

83
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I wanted more.

84
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Yeah.

85
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I know you came over like, where's all the buckle?

86
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Yeah.

87
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I'm like, it's gone.

88
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
But I looked over there's six pieces left.

89
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I had four of them.

90
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Did you?

91
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
That's awesome.

92
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
No, I'm a half-breed.

93
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Just half Spartan.

94
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So, no, yeah, man.

95
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I mean, like, the rest of America, you know, my, my,

96
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
grandparents, emigrated from Sparta.

97
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Greece.

98
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And the early 1900s, great-grand.

99
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Live to 105 legit credit.

100
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Yes.

101
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Yes.

102
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
My, he's even on Jockelway TV.

103
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Yes.

104
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He's some other shoes from Gordon.

105
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I'm going through it.

106
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
She, yeah.

107
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
No, she didn't need to be.

108
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
She had the Mediterranean diet.

109
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
No, it's not.

110
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I even my son got to meet her.

111
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
But she lived for a long time.

112
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But yeah.

113
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So, from a young age, I got to see the American dream

114
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
from my mom's side of the family, you know.

115
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
When we were kids, I was born down in Massachusetts,

116
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Gloucester.

117
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And moved up here when I was young,

118
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
she had my mom want to get myself and my three siblings.

119
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Out of Massachusetts and into the woods,

120
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
just because she saw some shifts happening,

121
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
she didn't like.

122
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So, she brought us up here and said,

123
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
make a go of it, basically.

124
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And what, what business or whatever, what did they, what did you,

125
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
oh, why saw, I got to see my,

126
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
my family built some pretty, pretty cool businesses

127
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
down in Massachusetts. So, being an entrepreneur

128
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
was something I always admired.

129
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But didn't realize I wanted to do that

130
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
until a little later in life.

131
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
But my, my family down there,

132
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
my grandfather had a sub shop, you know,

133
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
super-sug.

134
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
For those of you, I don't know,

135
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
there's, that's one of those things.

136
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
We're, they call it different things across America.

137
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Yeah.

138
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
A sub in New England is the same thing as a subway sandwich.

139
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Right, right.

140
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Also in New England, you call it a grinder.

141
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Do you call it a grinder?

142
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
A grinder would be, I think, technically.

143
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Ah, no, that's not a hot sandwich.

144
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
That's hogey.

145
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Oh, yeah.

146
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Yeah, hogey's a more poor boy.

147
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Oh, no.

148
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
That's a more poor boy.

149
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Yeah.

150
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Another, another, another, a more poor boy.

151
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So, sub.

152
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, so, grandad on the sub shop.

153
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
A few, a few sub, which is very successful with the sandwich making.

154
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Nice.

155
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I got, I got to see that.

156
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
My cousin's built a big multi, multi,

157
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
a million dollar company.

158
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And I, and I had to watch this from away,

159
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
because I moved up to here to Maine when I was eight years old.

160
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So, I wasn't cultured in that at all.

161
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
In the business world.

162
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I didn't have anybody to teach me about business.

163
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And I just got to see it and, and, and not be directly part of it,

164
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
which I always wanted to be, you know,

165
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
but I always looked up to them and, and what not.

166
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And both from business perspective and athletics,

167
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
you know, they were very good athletics, my family,

168
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and my uncles, cousins, and stuff.

169
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So, I looked from afar up here in Maine in the woods,

170
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and an old farmhouse down at dirt road with no neighbors.

171
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Cows in a field.

172
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Oh, yeah.

173
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
That's where I grew up.

174
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And then high school, you, you said you, I know you're athletic.

175
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
What do you, how, how tall are you?

176
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Six, three, and shrinking.

177
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Six, three, and shrink, yeah, man.

178
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And what's your, what are you walking around that right now?

179
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Right now, I can tell you exactly.

180
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Two, fifty, three point zero.

181
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Yes.

182
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
But you played, what, what'd you play?

183
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I, uh, in, in high school, three-squared athlete,

184
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
in college, football, division one for a couple of years.

185
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Um, not the best experience of my life, learning experience,

186
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
but not the best.

187
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Well, what, what, what wasn't the best experience in your life?

188
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I, you know, I was, I was real good at it, football.

189
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Uh-huh.

190
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I was not passionate about it.

191
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Um, but I still worked my ass off.

192
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Because that's the thing, you were kind of, even though you were this big,

193
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
jock.

194
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I was, you were also an artistic guy, right?

195
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Right?

196
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Art see, I was an artsy, artsy kid.

197
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I got along with everybody, the, the, the, the jocks athletes,

198
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
all the artsy kids, you know,

199
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I liked everybody, I could appreciate everybody's talents.

200
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Were you like drawing, painting, or are you doing everything?

201
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
That, drawing, painting, sculpting, sculpting, everything.

202
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Just doing everything.

203
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Yeah.

204
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And tackling people.

205
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Yeah.

206
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Getting tackle, play tight end.

207
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Which, were you more passionate about art than you were about football?

208
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
For sure.

209
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
For sure.

210
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And so you're playing football, like, it, it, was it just one of those things where you,

211
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
okay, I'm good at it, and I'm getting a scholarship, so I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.

212
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Yeah, so back in 1997, Berkinadurries, yeah.

213
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Oh, back in the day.

214
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Yes.

215
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Yeah, no, it was, back in the day, some will remember hockey fans,

216
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Maine's hockey team was phenomenal.

217
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
They had the career kids on there.

218
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And they were, that that team took gifts.

219
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And what happens when you get gifts and people find out sanctions.

220
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So I went into college and they had like 10 scholarships.

221
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
So I didn't actually have a scholarship till my second year of college.

222
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I kind of had to prove myself.

223
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And I work my ass off.

224
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And then I fell into the politics of college football.

225
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And I saw the ugly side of the politics of college football.

226
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And what are you talking about?

227
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Because I'm the only guy sitting at the table that it had an apparently play college football.

228
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
It was football. It was busy in the teams.

229
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
What do you think?

231
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
What does that consist of?

232
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Like you're trying to get to be in the certain position starting or is that what's

233
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
talking about?

234
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Let's say like, OK, yeah.

235
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So I was supposed to start my, I read,

236
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I read, my freshman, I was supposed to start.

237
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Tighten, got into a bar bra, right?

238
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And during the summer couldn't play the first few games.

239
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And it was me and one of my friends.

240
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And we were both freshman.

241
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And he was a big kid, local kid.

242
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
He ended playing in the NFL.

243
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And we were kind of like fighting for the first spot on the depth chart.

244
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And the depth chart for those of you who don't know is like kind of where you stand.

245
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And you see your name on there.

246
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And you see everyone else's name.

247
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And you want to be the top guy.

248
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Right?

249
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So you bring that out for every position?

250
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Oh, yeah.

251
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Oh, yeah.

252
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Every position.

253
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Check.

254
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Yeah.

255
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So a little pressure to perform.

256
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And I stayed after my freshman, I put on 27 pounds of like hard earned muscle.

257
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
No illegal substances,

258
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Scrots, McDonald's,

259
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and Scrots.

260
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
They be like, go eat some food.

261
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
That McDonald's.

262
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So what did you, what, what would you go from what weight to what weight?

263
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And I came into college at like,

264
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
two,

265
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
it was like,

266
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
200 in like,

267
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
225 in you and a little less.

268
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Oh, 10.

269
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Oh, 10.

270
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And then yeah,

271
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and then just earned it.

272
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
earned it in the gym.

273
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I remember my tight end coach coming up to me and saying,

274
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
hey, you know, Steve is his name.

275
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
He's like, he's out.

276
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And he's like, you're going to be starting this first game.

277
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And I'm like, shit.

278
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I mean, I stayed, I stayed like, work my ass off.

279
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
You know, stayed during breaks and everything.

280
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And I was a good athlete.

281
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Yeah.

282
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And what's cool is, you're actually going as hard as you can.

283
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Yeah.

284
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
You weren't even that passionate at all, but I committed to it.

285
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
You just wanted to win.

286
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Yes.

287
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Yeah.

288
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
No, I do it.

289
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
You look at yourself in that depth chart.

290
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Even if you don't necessarily like what you're doing,

291
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
you make the commitment and you drive.

292
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And I didn't want to be number two.

293
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
You know, so it's super competitive college sports.

294
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So anyways, the, my tight end coach,

295
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
like, you're starting the first game.

296
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I'm like, yes.

297
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Call all my family, call all my friends,

298
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
tell them what's up.

299
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Make sure everybody has tickets.

300
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I could day before the game.

302
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
The coach comes to me and says,

303
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Pete, I gotta talk to you.

304
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Nice to see him.

305
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Okay? He's like, I just got in a huge argument with a head coach.

306
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And you will not be starting in the football game.

307
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I said, okay, why?

308
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
He goes,

309
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
basically told me politics.

310
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
My friend, still a friend of mine,

311
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
local kid.

312
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
He came in on a full ride.

313
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Local kid, big kid,

314
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
had probably a better frame to build on.

315
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And basically what the,

316
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
even though maybe,

317
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
you know, it's college.

318
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
We have different gifts.

319
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
The head coach shut it down and said,

320
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
nope, he's not starting.

321
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
My coach is like, he should start.

322
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
He's performing better.

323
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
You know, he's strong in the weight room.

324
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Hand cleaning 300 pounds.

325
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
The kids ready to go.

326
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
He should be starting.

327
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
They got a huge fight.

328
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Almost got fired.

329
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
The coach, my, my head and coach,

330
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I'm scared fired.

331
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
He said, you'll be playing a lot in the game though.

332
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
But yeah, he'll be starting.

333
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Guess how much playing time I saw.

334
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
No, zero.

335
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So that was the first game of the season you said.

336
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Yeah.

337
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And so then what happens?

338
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
You grind out the rest of the season?

339
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Yeah, man.

340
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
How's your attitude?

341
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I worked my ass off and turned.

342
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Turn, you kept grind to earn.

343
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Did you ever start?

344
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Here's the shitty thing.

345
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I've already sounded pretty shitty.

346
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Yeah, actually.

347
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
It's pretty shitty, dude.

348
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Here's the shitty thing.

349
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Man, I couldn't, I'm telling you,

350
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
I had football PTSD after this.

351
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I didn't watch football for 10 years.

352
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
They put on television.

353
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I'd walk out of the room.

354
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I just hang out, do something else.

355
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
They'd be watching the games.

356
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
My son loves football.

357
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
My, my family loves football.

358
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Couldn't do it.

359
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I had like a, just not version to the sport to make a long story short.

360
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
My, this has been 45 minutes.

361
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
We haven't even made a pass.

362
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Shut up.

363
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Has it been?

364
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Has it?

365
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
No, my, my, my, my scholarship, the money, like,

366
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
like some of the money hit your count, right?

367
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And like, shit didn't kick in for like my

368
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
food and everything and like my coach, the head coach.

369
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Who was a narcissistic guy?

370
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Love coming to the weight room and just like waving his hair and you know,

371
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I don't know what it's got.

372
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
You know what it's got.

373
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Yeah, college money.

374
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Great.

376
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
He's like, I'll take care of it.

377
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Pete, let's find everything's happening.

378
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Okay.

379
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Weak later.

380
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Coach still, this, this isn't, you know,

381
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I'm, I'm on it.

382
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I'm on it.

383
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I'm on it.

384
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
I'm talking with the AD.

385
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
It's everything's good.

386
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Weak later.

387
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Coach, it's still like, man, I'm stressing.

388
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
You know, like, I'm going to have to get a job, like,

389
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
what's up with this?

390
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
He goes, I need to talk to you my office.

391
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Is it okay?

392
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I sit down in his office.

393
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Your scholarship money is not going to kick in.

394
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Really?

395
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I overgave.

396
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Title IX had kicked in.

397
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
I'm going to get a job.

398
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I'm going to get a job.

399
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
I'm going to get a job.

400
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I'm going to get a job.

401
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I'm going to get a job.

402
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
I'm going to get a job.

403
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Title IX had kicked in, and he overgave.

404
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Now, is he being truthful with me?

405
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Or did he find a new recruit that was better?

406
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Did he push me out?

407
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Who knows?

408
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
I don't know why because the kid behind me ended up starting full back the next year.

409
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Right?

410
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
So, maybe I got pushed out.

411
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Maybe he overgave.

412
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Back to the matter is that bastard lied to me.

413
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I didn't fall through with his word.

414
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And that will never happen again.

415
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
I will never surround myself with those types of people.

416
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And that lesson I carry to this day.

417
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I think about it a lot.

418
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
It's one of those moments in your life that kind of changes your life.

419
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I said, you know, I'll tell you something.

420
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
I worked my balls off for you in this program.

421
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I'm ready.

422
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And this is what I get.

423
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
That excuse out out of the office.

424
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I grabbed my cleats and then into my body Chad Rogers and walked out the door and didn't look back.

425
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
That was that.

426
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
So, that was your sophomore year.

427
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Yeah, that would have been my red shirt.

428
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
It was right after my wrist.

429
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Yeah, sophomore year.

430
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Yeah.

431
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So, what are you studying at this time?

432
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Studying a new media.

433
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Which was really new because remember the internet hit like 97.

434
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
The 80 became hot, right?

435
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Really?

436
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
There's a data on that.

437
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Yeah.

438
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Pretty ambiguously.

439
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Like you can call it 97.

440
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Yeah.

441
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
That's when it became hot.

442
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Yeah.

443
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Yeah.

444
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Like I think so.

445
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Yeah.

446
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
For sure.

447
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
That's when it was like the internet.

448
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Yeah.

449
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Everybody need everybody.

450
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
What is it?

451
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Yeah.

452
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Yeah.

453
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Net skating.

454
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Yeah.

455
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
But you know, you could really surf the web.

456
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Yeah.

457
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Okay.

458
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
So, web sites and stuff.

459
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Yeah.

460
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Yeah.

461
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
So, I'm in and flat this flash hit.

462
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
It came out, back in media, all the stuff.

463
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
So anyways, I was into that.

464
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:50.000
I discovered the computer thing and fell in love with design on the computer.

465
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And although I was a sculpture major, I used a well-dop crazy looking shit.

466
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
I actually zipped her to co-post.

467
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Dude, I did.

468
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
For like my final project, you want to know what I did?

469
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Yeah.

470
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
I built this big frigging zipper on this canvas.

471
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
And I erected it and I zipped it up the pole post.

472
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
I'm talking about the, like the, like the, like the, like a giant real zipper.

473
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Real zipper.

474
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
You know, like the thing, the thing you hold the, yeah, that dude, it was this big.

475
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
I zipped my, my, my art teacher.

476
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
They allowed you to do that.

477
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
They'd have a choice.

478
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
I just went out and did it.

479
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
So it's down.

480
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Yeah.

481
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And what's that like street art?

482
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I don't even know what I'm speaking.

483
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
I love art.

484
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Yeah.

485
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.000
It was weird.

486
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
I think I got some of that frustration out of you for shivering it up.

487
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Yeah.

488
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I have never told anybody that.

489
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Do something to my, my, my, my, my, my, my,

490
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Did you get graded on it?

491
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Yeah, dude.

492
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
So how did you not tell anybody?

493
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Because what happened was, is I erected it in the practice field.

494
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
And my teacher, she walked over with me to look at it.

495
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And she looked at me and she was, she said, a plus.

496
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Wait, they should be, you did it.

497
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Like you did in this, like you did in this, like,

498
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
She looked at me and she goes, she looked at me and she goes,

499
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
She said, what?

500
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
She, she didn't think it was possible.

501
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Bro, when you said like I zippered my goal,

502
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
plus I'm sitting here thinking, what is this?

503
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Some slang term that I don't know about.

504
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Does that mean hanging toilet paper off of it?

505
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Like, where does this mean?

506
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
It means zippering.

507
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I wish I had a photo of it.

508
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
I wish you did.

509
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
We didn't have digital cameras back then.

510
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Yeah, but that teacher was cool.

511
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
She was, I remember her name, but she was cool.

512
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And you left it up for the practice.

513
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Guys, when they shut up, pull it down.

514
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
She actually, she actually,

515
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Toped pulled me aside one time and she's like,

516
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
you drive this class.

517
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
How, what you do and how you act,

518
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
everyone is going to follow basically.

519
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
She was, she was pretty cool,

520
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
but that is a gentle vengeance.

521
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
It's very much, I'll give you props.

522
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
zipper that zipper it done.

523
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.000
zipper it.

524
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
You wait, not that's happening.

525
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
I'll tell as a goal post.

526
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Man, I think we should call it.

527
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
35 feet, 30 feet, probably more than,

528
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
like, the full go,

529
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
open.

530
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
That depends with the practice field.

531
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
It helps you.

532
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
It's full zipper.

533
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
I am not even kidding.

534
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
I put that, I put in the, and I built it out of,

535
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
like, wood-laminated band saw, like,

536
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
all the lugs and I had the 50 get the perfectly in that whole zipper part had the zip.

537
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
It was functional.

538
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Yes.

539
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
It was a giant zipper.

540
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
That's good.

541
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
I love she's like, I told my teacher,

542
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I was new.

543
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
She's like, impossible to make it function.

544
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Okay, let's see.

545
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Yeah.

546
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
That guy said it's 42.

547
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Yeah.

548
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
That guy mentioned that earlier.

549
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Yeah.

550
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And at this time, what,

551
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
are you, what's like going on personally, personal life?

552
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Do you want you with your high school sweet heart at the world?

553
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

554
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
So, I, my wife Amanda, my bride.

555
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
We got together.

556
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
We were 16, 15, 16,

557
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
through, through a difficult situation.

558
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
We became friends.

559
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
And we've been together for a sense.

560
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
We were drawn together by a difficult situation.

561
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
And you stayed together through college.

562
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Absolutely.

563
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
And she wasn't looking at you like, like,

564
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
I need to get away from this guy.

565
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Yeah, the zipper goes.

566
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
You know, she, she's very understanding.

567
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I'm sharing it.

568
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Yeah.

569
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Yeah, you know, the court in line, like, you complete me.

570
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Like, she, I tell people like,

571
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
she, if my glass is a little full,

572
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
she just dumped some out.

573
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And if it's running a little dry, she puts it back in.

574
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
So, and she always has, you know what I mean?

575
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
So, she's brutally honest.

576
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
And, you know, she's like, my soulmate.

577
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
I, that's awesome that you guys were, you know,

578
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
I knew that.

579
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
But it's kind of cool that you guys did.

580
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
You've got to get it all that time.

581
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Now, back to your, your major.

582
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And now you're saying, I'm playing football.

583
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Oh, no. You're sitting there in college.

584
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Yep. You're studying new media, which no one knows anything about.

585
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
I don't even know anything about it.

586
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
And we actually hired the professors, my class.

587
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Really?

588
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
We had a, we committee of students and we hired the frequent professors.

589
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
And so, and so then you're learning how to do what?

590
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
For build websites.

591
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Yeah.

592
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Stuff like this.

593
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
You're learning things like, uh,

594
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
It's what all like the first software hit you had like this Maya.

595
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
And you could do 3D animation.

596
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
They built like, I don't toy story and Maya or something.

597
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
You had like flash, macromedia.

598
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Remember the flash websites, all the animation.

599
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Yeah.

600
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Stuff like that.

601
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
So we, I learned about that.

602
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
So how did you make the jump from that to going into business in that arena?

603
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
I was good at it.

604
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And I was passionate about it.

605
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And what happened is my sophomore year after I got on playing football.

606
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
I went right to a marketing agency.

607
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Sold myself on the spot and got hired on the spot.

608
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
And I became their lead web developer.

609
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And you're like 19.

610
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I was 19 with blonde hair.

611
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Nice.

612
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Yep.

613
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
They were like, who is this kid?

614
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
For the record is when I was 19, I had blonde hair too.

615
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
No kid.

616
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Yeah.

617
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
It's a lot of similarities.

618
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
That's cool.

619
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Well, a lot of Hawaiians have blonde hair.

620
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
So.

621
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
So 19 with blonde hair, yeah, man.

622
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I walked in and I just sold myself.

623
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Okay.

624
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
So then how did that morph into your own business?

625
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Yeah.

626
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
So I wasn't going to push job.

627
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I take it if you're the lead at 19 years old.

628
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Push job at 200 bucks a week, buddy.

629
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Raking.

630
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Which I needed to do.

631
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Which was pretty legit for you though, right?

632
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Yeah.

633
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Because it was either that or the YMCA.

634
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
You know, and I did work at the Y.

635
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
But yeah.

636
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I mean, it was.

637
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
I caught my teeth at this ad agency where I learned from this really good.

638
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Graphic designer Brad, who started his career doing paste up.

639
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
So paste up is like when you're designing an ad, you actually have to take an exact.

640
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
So all the little tools you use when you're in like Photoshop and other programs.

641
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Those are real tools, real life tools.

642
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
So he take like the knife and cut around the picture and then he put that.

643
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And then like the typography.

644
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
So I cut my teeth under a real designer.

645
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Not many people get that anymore.

646
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
So I learned from a master of design and how long did you stay at that ad agency?

647
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
I was there till I was 19, 20, 21, 3 years I think.

648
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And then I moved back and I started my own company here.

649
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And that was just in Sparado.

650
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
What made you say, you know what?

651
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
But you must have seen a pathway at the agency to take over or not even take over.

652
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
But just to move up the chain of command and get paid more than 200 bucks a week and all that.

653
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
I did.

654
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
What in your brain clicked were you like, you know what?

655
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I'm not working for the man.

656
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Yeah, absolutely.

657
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
I'll tell you that.

658
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
I got to go back to give you that though.

659
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Raking blueberries and throwing hay.

660
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Manual labor.

661
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Throw hay for a day and get a $10 real.

662
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
You're going to work very hard not to do that.

663
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Raking blueberries and Maine, which is a staple of us.

664
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Mane is that's tough work.

665
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
You're bent over in the sun in the blueberry fields.

666
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
And guess what you do for your first week, you earn your rake.

667
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
So what does that mean?

668
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
There's a different job that you use the rake picking or something.

669
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
You've got a bottle of rake.

670
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
You're in debt.

671
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
You're in debt.

672
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
You start and you give you the rake and you have to work it off.

673
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
How much do you think that rake cost?

674
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
I'm doing the math.

675
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
I'm like.

676
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
I'm like, this is tough.

677
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
But I like it.

678
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
So when I walked into my interview at this marketing agency,

679
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
this kind of a pompous kid, I said,

680
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
he said, what do you want to do long term?

681
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Mark, I said, start my own business.

682
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
I'm going to own my own business.

683
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
He goes, you don't want to do that.

684
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
You do not want to own your own business.

685
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
You don't know what it takes to survive in a world of business.

686
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
And I said, okay.

687
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Proceed.

688
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Then I learned in sucked the knowledge I could.

689
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
All the knowledge I could.

690
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
I just sucked it and sucked it and sucked it.

691
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And then I moved home and started.

692
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
And what city was that?

693
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
I started.

694
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Well, I started the business out of my college apartment.

695
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
It was about as big as this table.

696
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
I was the man though.

697
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I had a little a Mac.

698
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
The black one, Wall Street.

699
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
There was a mall.

700
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
There was a mall.

701
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
It had like a, it was black and had like rubber on the sides.

702
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
You know what I mean?

703
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
That's a U of the man.

704
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Yeah.

705
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
And I think that thing caused me some issues because it was very tough to have kids.

706
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
I sat that thing on my lap for hours on end.

707
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
And I'm telling you, something was really Haitian.

708
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Man, I had to practice a lot to have kids.

709
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Practice was good, but it got a little tough when it was like,

710
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
I can't have kids.

711
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
So, but yeah, man, I started the business out of my college apartment.

712
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
My first insight and new media marketing agency and new media company.

713
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And just started hammering.

714
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
And I was fearless going after accounts and clients.

715
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
You know, and two years later, I find myself in Park City, Utah sitting in the front of the president of

716
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Rosakna, I'll click so we're selling them an idea like Bill Gates, I didn't exist yet.

717
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
I'm telling them what I could do and then they gave me the money to do it.

718
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
And then we did it.

719
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
And the rest of history.

720
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
So, so everything was rocking.

721
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
And so it's a long day.

722
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Did you, so you were in your college apartment, but then where did you end up?

723
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I ended up here in my hometown.

724
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
And you had space.

725
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
You got an office in all nine yards?

726
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Yeah, well, I started in a barn.

727
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
And it was me and another guy, my first hire.

728
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
And then we moved into kind of like a double wide trailer in house.

729
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
You know, we call it a double wide.

730
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Did it have a skirt?

731
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

732
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Okay.

733
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
You're using a different figure right?

734
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Did it have a skirt?

735
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
It's a vinyl skirt.

736
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
You kidding me?

737
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Yeah.

738
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Who doesn't have a vinyl skirt?

739
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Gotta keep it real.

740
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So we went there and then we moved into a basement in town.

741
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
This is like the perfect progression.

742
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Right?

743
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Yeah.

744
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
And then we hired a few more.

745
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:26.000
And then we moved into a beautiful, we had built out a studio where, man, it was,

746
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
we actually designed it.

747
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Because you were making legit money now.

748
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
We were.

749
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
How many employees are we talking about?

750
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
I think maybe seven or so.

751
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Okay.

752
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Something like that.

753
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
And now you're 22.

754
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Yeah.

755
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
If that, yeah, yeah.

756
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Probably 22.

757
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Getting out of 22 years old.

758
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Yeah.

759
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Six employees.

760
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Yeah.

761
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Custom design office.

762
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
So we did everything.

763
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
You want to hear something?

764
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
I don't know if I should say this.

765
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Okay.

766
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
You ready for this?

767
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
You may have to edit this out.

768
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
All right.

769
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
I handled two governors campaigns in Maine.

770
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
22 years old.

771
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
They wanted to like the best design, the best marketing.

772
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
So they came to these youngins.

773
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Mm-hmm.

774
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
And we had this one guy, less often.

775
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Should maybe you not say the name?

776
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
It was a national news.

777
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Sorry.

778
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I want to.

779
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
You can cut it out.

780
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Understood.

781
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Really national news.

782
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
No.

783
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
It's national news.

784
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Okay.

785
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Really nice guy.

786
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Right after Obama's first term.

787
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
So less came and he wanted us to handle his campaign.

788
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
And so he wanted a logo that was circular like Obama's logo.

789
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
And so we did a eye design myself a circular logo, which green and blue.

790
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Very similar feel.

791
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Not even close to the same, but it was around.

792
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
And who had done a round logo at that time?

793
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Next thing I know, this thing ends up on CNN, all the national news stations.

794
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And they have like the two logos.

795
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
They have Obama's logo.

796
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Okay.

797
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
And less is logo.

798
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
I've got it.

799
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Of influx of emails and phone calls.

800
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
People like RIPIC.

801
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Because remember how that first term for Obama?

802
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Remember how hot that was.

803
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Yeah.

804
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Remember why were people negative when they were negative on you?

805
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Because they were like we ripped it off.

806
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
And I was like really, really.

807
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
So it was round.

808
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Don't make a round logo.

809
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Yeah.

810
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Especially after the first Obama.

811
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
They don't use circles.

812
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Don't use circles.

813
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
They say that's like that's what they're saying.

814
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Don't use circles.

815
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
So anyways, it was it was an interesting time.

816
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
There's a little bit of stress.

817
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Did he catch heat for it?

818
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Obviously.

819
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Yeah.

820
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Yeah.

821
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Because no one really cared that you don't know.

822
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Even knew that like some.

823
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
He wasn't like, oh my, I had agency made it up.

824
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
And I thought it was great.

825
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
No, well, he, you know what they, you know, kind of a little bit.

826
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
He did that.

827
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
But he had an advice advisor that said, this is the right direction and whatnot.

828
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So it was, it was interesting times.

829
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
So what was the heat?

830
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
The heat was like national media like ripping you down.

831
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
People dig down who designed it.

832
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Like when company that designed it and just like tearing you off.

833
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
They found you your book picture.

834
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
It was a straight.

835
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
It was like Obama.

836
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
It was like 15 days of like holy shit.

837
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Like we're going to survive this as a company, you know.

838
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
And we did.

839
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Yeah.

840
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Yeah.

841
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
And so you, you survived that.

842
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Yeah.

843
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
And I guess your lesson is like from that that you can survive things.

844
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
You're going to like it's interesting.

845
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
I just caught that you said 15 days.

846
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Yeah.

847
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Because guess what?

848
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
15 days no one cared anymore.

849
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Is that pretty much pretty much.

850
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Yeah.

851
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
I see that a lot in the news. You know, people, some people freak out about something.

852
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
And I'm like, yeah, I wait.

853
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
I'll wait a week.

854
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Four or four days.

855
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Something else anymore.

856
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
There's like some other media that hit the satellite thing or whatever.

857
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Yeah.

858
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
So it was, it was interesting.

859
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
You know, we were young, you know, in naive, you know.

860
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
I mean, I think all entrepreneurs start out naive honestly.

861
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
And from a leadership perspective, you're in a leadership position.

862
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Yeah.

863
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Right. For the first time.

864
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Yeah.

865
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
And you have a team of six people.

866
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Yeah.

867
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
You're the man.

868
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Yep.

869
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
And I'm trusting.

870
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
You see, you say that little hesitation.

871
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Yeah.

872
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
I trust that people will do the right thing.

873
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Are the people that are working for you, your age?

874
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Yeah.

875
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Younger.

876
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Just all the things.

877
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Same age.

878
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Year two difference.

879
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Okay.

880
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
All young.

881
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
So now you said recession.

882
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
What happens there?

883
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Well, we were kind of like booming as a company building.

884
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
So it's an incredible, we would do interactive touch screen.

885
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Key asks and all this really, really cool shit.

886
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
What that nobody was doing yet.

887
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Recession hit.

888
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
We lost 65% of our business overnight.

889
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
We once the first thing you cut in a recession advertising.

890
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
You're not supposed to.

891
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
But you do.

892
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
It's a wrong move.

893
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
But it's the move that everyone makes.

894
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Yeah, man.

895
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
I probably make the same move.

896
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Where can we cut costs?

897
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Add spend.

898
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Right?

899
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Stop that.

900
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Anyways, the recession hit.

901
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
And we had built this company from like the ground up.

902
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Just funneled the money back into the company.

903
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Bill built by equipment, build this to do all this stuff.

904
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
I'm like, oh shit.

905
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
First time I thought about like these guys bought houses here.

906
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Have families, are starting families.

907
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Move away.

908
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
How long had the run been at this point?

909
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
This had been five years.

910
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
That's a good question.

911
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
What is the recession eight or nine?

912
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
This is six, seven year run.

913
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Okay.

914
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Six.

915
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
So yeah, these guys had established their lives.

916
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
They established their families up here.

917
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Yes.

918
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
They you were the form of income.

919
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
You're how they're paying their mortgage.

920
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Absolutely.

921
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
And I felt that.

922
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
You know, I don't know if that's a weakness.

923
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
But I'm sensitive to that, man.

924
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
I that if I promise somebody something like this company is your future.

925
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
I mean this company is your future.

926
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I will stop taking a paycheck and that's not the right thing to do.

927
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
You got to always pay yourself right.

928
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
I will stop taking a paycheck to make sure you get yours.

929
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
That's what I did.

930
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
And what I also did is I took out a line of credit.

931
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
It was the first money I had taken out from the bank ever.

932
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000
And I used that money to keep things going to try to get through the recession.

933
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
And I didn't want to lay anybody off.

934
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
What I had them do was I had them start designing in house.

935
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Because by the way, the next thing that you do after you cut advertising, the biggest cost

936
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
just about any business there is is your people.

937
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
So that's the next thing that gets cut.

938
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
But you're saying you're not going to do that.

939
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
And I'm young.

940
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Yeah.

941
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
And learning about business as I go, you know.

942
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
So no, I'm not going to do it.

943
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
No, they some of them bought houses and stuff.

944
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
You know, like I'm not taking away their livelihood.

945
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
You know, I'll find a way to just get through, right?

946
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
You know.

947
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
And I believe I had the fortitude to get through, you know.

948
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
But.

949
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
And there's the butt.

950
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
They didn't.

951
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000
And here's why because I had them start working on in house projects.

952
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
And I was training jujitsu at the time.

953
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And so I was going to develop a platform.

954
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
So that an academy could build a website based off of a template.

955
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
A system for their jujitsu school.

956
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
And it was going to be badass.

957
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
And we had done this for like, Rossignol and Dean of Star.

958
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000
We had, we were like one of the first companies to build online tools to build things.

959
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Makes sense.

960
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Mm-hmm.

961
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
There's a night, it early 2000s.

962
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
So we're going on and you look at some product and you want to,

963
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
There's a little customization that can be done to it.

964
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
You guys, the design things to move the mouse around.

965
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Yeah.

966
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
The bunch of those now, but it was a bunch of, it was none of them.

967
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Okay.

968
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
So we started building this thing.

969
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
And you're building this thing, but you're not being paid for it yet.

970
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Because eventually we're going to sell it.

971
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Right.

972
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
That's what you're doing.

973
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.000
That's what you're doing.

974
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
That's what you're doing.

975
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
That's what you're doing.

976
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
That's what you're doing.

977
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.000
That's what you're doing.

978
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
That's what you're doing.

979
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
That's what you're doing.

980
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Now, did you jujitsu take a little bit more of my time than it should have?

981
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
You know, these things happen.

982
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Yeah.

983
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Did I think about it more than anything else in the world?

984
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
I did.

985
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
And just real quick, how'd you get it in a jujitsu?

986
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Well, after football, I stopped playing football.

987
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
And I was like, man, I need to fight.

988
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
I always had this desire to fight.

989
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Maybe I'll men have that.

990
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
I don't know, but I felt like many extra extra.

991
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Like extra.

992
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Like I need to fight.

993
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
So I'm like tycoando.

994
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
So I started fighting in tycoando and achieved that in about two years.

995
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
I was like, okay.

996
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Now what?

997
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
And then I found jujitsu.

998
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
And I got choked out by 150 pound kid.

999
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
And I was 285 pounds.

1000
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
And I was like, that's a conventor.

1001
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
I'm in.

1002
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Configured out.

1003
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
I came at him with every bit of athleticism.

1004
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
The kid choked me out.

1005
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
I was cold.

1006
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Yeah.

1007
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
I had what just happened.

1008
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And I bought into it.

1009
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
So many out.

1010
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Anyways, I was passionate about jujitsu.

1011
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
And I had this perfect plan to build a system.

1012
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
And they started getting salty about it.

1013
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Now is that because they felt like there wasn't income.

1014
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
It's because they weren't getting paid by the project.

1015
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Getting commissioned or something like that.

1016
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
What were they getting salty about?

1017
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
They all got salaries.

1018
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
So what were they getting salty about?

1019
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
The fact that they were working on my pet projects.

1020
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Those words, my pet projects.

1021
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
They were also salty.

1022
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
I had two very young kids in my wife in the office.

1023
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
That the kids were in the office.

1024
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And they were playing with their stuff.

1025
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
And doing what kids do.

1026
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
They're being kids.

1027
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000
My company, my office, my kids.

1028
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Okay.

1029
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
They found that a problem.

1030
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
So out of the menu.

1031
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
What was your relationship?

1032
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Because this, I'm just assuming right now that you got a bunch of people that are working for you that are around the same age as you.

1033
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Yep.

1034
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
And so I'm guessing that you're kind of growing out with them.

1035
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Superb rows.

1036
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Superb rows.

1037
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Superb rows.

1038
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Superb rows.

1039
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
The immature kids.

1040
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Right.

1041
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Talented immature kids.

1042
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
I mean, you're talking about like, hey, let's shut it down and go snowboarding.

1043
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
We've got two inches of pow pow, unsure below.

1044
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
You know, and we need to hit that.

1045
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
And as we do, we just shut it down.

1046
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Grab the snowping or a rosy gnaw would send us like $10,000 from product.

1047
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
We just, we just go up.

1048
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Just rip on the mountain.

1049
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Hey, man, just get the work done.

1050
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
You know, oh, you need to, yeah, man, no worries.

1051
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Just do, just make sure the work's done.

1052
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Yep.

1053
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Very loose.

1054
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Superb rows.

1055
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Superb rows.

1056
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Talented.

1057
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Yes.

1058
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Hit the pow pow.

1059
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Let's do it.

1060
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
The powder.

1061
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:09.000
So, yeah, man, the relationship was not a boss worker employee relationship.

1062
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
It was a creative.

1063
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
I always wanted to, we had a fuzball table.

1064
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
And the, you know, and give me a break.

1065
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
I mean, it's a creative agency.

1066
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Yep.

1067
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Yep.

1068
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Yep.

1069
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
But when shit hits the fan, the fingers go to one person.

1070
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
This guy, right?

1071
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
So, all right.

1072
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
I'm ready to sustain this thing to make it happen.

1073
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
They weren't.

1074
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
So, one day, I'm in my wife's office.

1075
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
And the whole crew gets up and hands me a paper.

1076
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
And it's a thick paper.

1077
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
And they're like, we'll see you on Monday to talk about this.

1078
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Because they thought they weren't expendable.

1079
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Okay.

1080
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
So, they're giving you an ultimatum.

1081
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Ultimatum.

1082
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
I was like, I turned white for a second.

1083
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
I was like, okay.

1084
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
And they walked out.

1085
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Were you, did you anticipate this at all?

1086
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
No.

1087
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Yeah.

1088
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
No idea.

1089
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
I would never be caught off guard like that again.

1090
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Yeah, that one's going to speak.

1091
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
That one's going to leave a mark.

1092
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
This isn't, isn't mutiny.

1093
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
That's a huge straight up mutiny.

1094
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Yep.

1095
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Okay.

1096
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
My wife is an emotional being.

1097
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
We sat down and we read this paper.

1098
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
And it was a list of demands.

1099
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000
A list of demands about profit sharing.

1100
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
How the company was making all this money.

1101
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
And it wasn't being filtered down to the employees.

1102
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.000
And about my kids and how they cannot come into the office anymore.

1103
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Because they make noise.

1104
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
A whole list of demands.

1105
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
They can't concentrate when they're playing food's ball.

1106
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Yeah.

1107
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
And yeah, amongst other things.

1108
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Young, stupid kids.

1109
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Yeah.

1110
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
And I was one of them.

1111
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Yeah.

1112
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Because I was naive.

1113
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
So we started looking to this thing.

1114
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000
And I was like, wow, it's like, I can punch in the face.

1115
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
And my wife went, thing.

1116
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
And she spun up.

1117
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
And she's, she's French Canadian.

1118
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
And she's, she's, you know, yeah, anyway.

1119
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
She spun up.

1120
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
That's okay.

1121
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Does she speak French when she's angry?

1122
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
No.

1123
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Okay.

1124
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
I wish that would be kind of hard.

1125
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
She did.

1126
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
I was from around.

1127
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
I'm like, maybe speak French.

1128
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Just make your madzans to get yell at you and do that.

1129
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Yeah.

1130
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
No.

1131
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:43.000
So, so what we did is we just, we sat there and looked at each other and we're like, what?

1132
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
And I said, did they have any idea?

1133
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
We just took out a line of credit to support this place to get through the recession.

1134
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Did they have any idea we don't have any work?

1135
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
So what do we do?

1136
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Recon.

1137
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:06.000
We opened up their computers, logged in and started looking for all the interaction between the staff.

1138
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
And wow.

1139
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
What they thought of me?

1140
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
I was sad.

1141
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
I was like, wow.

1142
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
This is sad.

1143
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Maybe you feel like shit.

1144
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
What do they think?

1145
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000
I mean, they thought I was like, some type of miser, like, squirling, weight, cash, and resources.

1146
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Yeah.

1147
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Because I was kept a straight face, a happy personality.

1148
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
They had no idea how much in the whole we were.

1149
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Yeah.

1150
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
And I can imagine that you're trying to actually protect them from the stress of business.

1151
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Yes.

1152
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
And in doing that, you didn't communicate to them what was actually happening, which meant that they created

1153
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
What was happening in their own minds, which was obviously wrong.

1154
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
They're creating what they think reality is in their minds when they don't know all the facts.

1155
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
There's so many times in business when I talk to businesses and business are going through

1156
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
transitions or there's something happening.

1157
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.000
They'll be asking, well, do you think we should tell the employees what's happening?

1158
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Right.

1159
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
And I'm like, well, you have two choices.

1160
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
You can tell them what's happening.

1161
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Are they going to make up a story?

1162
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
They're going to make up a story.

1163
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And it's not going to be good.

1164
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
They're going to think worst case scenario.

1165
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
And so the open communications that is how you prevent this kind of thing.

1166
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
And obviously, you're 22 years old. That's pretty awesome that you were in the position you were in.

1167
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
And obviously, you can look back now.

1168
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
And it's pretty simple to see what the solutions were.

1169
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
One of them you were you were growing out with these guys too much.

1170
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000
And this is a fine line, you know, because, you know, in a super tune, I had

1171
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Bros.

1172
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Lifetime brothers.

1173
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Yeah.

1174
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
That were, you know, three or four ranks below me.

1175
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
But they were professional.

1176
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And they understood the line between and they understood.

1177
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
And they respected the position.

1178
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
And then there's other guys that were, you know, that same rank,

1179
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
lower rank that I couldn't give that kind of closeness to.

1180
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
And so that's one of those things that, you know, we talk about a lot with companies

1181
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
is it's different for the different people in your company.

1182
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
So I'm not saying you can't grow out with people.

1183
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
And also, that doesn't mean you don't have awesome relationships with your people.

1184
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Because that's what you want.

1185
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
You want to have awesome relationships with the people that are working for you.

1186
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Because they're going to do that much more for you and you can do that much more for them.

1187
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
And it becomes a functional winning team because everyone cares about each other.

1188
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Exactly.

1189
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000
There's a dichotomy there.

1190
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000
You know, are we being, there's a line?

1191
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Are we super bros?

1192
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
What is that line?

1193
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
What is that line?

1194
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And that line is the thing that you need to figure out.

1195
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
What makes it really hard with the relationship pieces that it's different for different

1196
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
people.

1197
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
And I had some guys that wasn't even five in a single tune.

1198
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And I was the lieutenant and they were my total bros.

1199
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
And there's another guy that's in the five and I got to keep a little distance just so they make sure that they

1200
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
They stay professional.

1201
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Right.

1202
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
And so this is this is challenging stuff and great lessons learned for anyone to run into business.

1203
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Especially young people.

1204
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000
But it's not just young people because I see seasoned CEOs asking these same questions.

1205
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
You don't learn this shit in college.

1206
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
I'm so sorry.

1207
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:16.000
You know, like being an entrepreneur, business man or woman, whatever.

1208
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
It's learned, you know, you may have a gift of something or a good counting.

1209
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Maybe a good sales person or good marketing or somebody's born with a gift to be an entrepreneur.

1210
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:34.000
You know, it's built, it's crafted over time and you have to fail and fall flat on your face and get punched in the face to figure it out.

1211
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Yeah.

1212
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
So.

1213
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
But what's good is, unfortunately, there's those lessons that your parents tried to teach you, but you didn't listen to.

1214
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
And they come out of this.

1215
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
And if you're even aware of them, and that's what's good about like someone that's hearing what you're saying right now.

1216
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
They, they might not recognize it before.

1217
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
And this is a chapter in extreme ownership, right?

1218
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
That got to me of leadership and you got to be, you can't be so close to your people that ones more important to it.

1219
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
We go through this, right?

1220
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000
But the awareness of it is it gives people a percentage chance of maybe instead of falling flat on their face.

1221
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Maybe they just stumble and they're able to recover.

1222
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Right.

1223
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
So this is, you know, classic.

1224
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
I felt flat.

1225
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Yes.

1226
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Do it hurt too.

1227
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Oh, so what happens?

1228
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
So I was, I was sad man at first.

1229
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Then I got angry.

1230
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
And then I got even.

1231
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
No.

1232
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
No.

1233
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000
I, basically what it was is we are not expendable.

1234
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Heed these words and these demands.

1235
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
And we'll talk to you Monday morning.

1236
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Okay.

1237
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
So what happens?

1238
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
We do a little recon.

1239
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Get into the computers.

1240
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
See the communication between all of them.

1241
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
What they thought about me, what they thought about my wife.

1242
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
What they thought was going on with the company.

1243
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Half an hour later, I'm in my vehicle, divide and conquer.

1244
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
You're not going to tell me, because in that paper, it said, do not come in see us individually.

1245
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Do not seek us out.

1246
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Do not try to separate one of us and have a conversation.

1247
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
And that's exactly what I did.

1248
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:18.000
By the way, from the employee standpoint, this is a horrible move.

1249
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
They are making doop as bad of a mistake as you were making as a leader.

1250
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Because what they should have any one of them could have done is said, Pete, bro, I got to talk to you man.

1251
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Let me tell you what's going on.

1252
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Yeah.

1253
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
This is what we're thinking.

1254
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000
We don't know what's going on with the company.

1255
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000
You've got us working on these random projects that are like your projects.

1256
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
We should be working for other companies.

1257
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Can you tell us what God's name is going on so we can move forward?

1258
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000
That's one of those people.

1259
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Nobody was that mature.

1260
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
And you could have brought him into a room and said, hey guys, I apologize for not telling you.

1261
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000
But let me tell you what income we have on the next six months.

1262
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Nothing.

1263
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Nothing.

1264
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
So this is what we're going to do to try and survive.

1265
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
You could have given the plan they would understand why you're doing what you're doing.

1266
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
And it would have been good.

1267
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
So both sides of the chain of command, there are actually making grievous mistakes.

1268
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
I had mistakes.

1269
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
And I learned from that that was, I mean, I'm a transparent person as it is.

1270
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
You can ask me anything you want.

1271
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
And I will answer it.

1272
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
I was just a dumb kid though.

1273
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
I didn't want to show weakness to them.

1274
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Is what I was thinking.

1275
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Right.

1276
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Because I didn't want them to feel like they needed to go find another job.

1277
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
I didn't want them to think that start talking like all the companies are going to shut down.

1278
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
I was making my own stories.

1279
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
I didn't trust they would make the right decision if I told them this.

1280
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
So I just carried on to try to push through.

1281
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
And you're right, it was a mistake to not share it with them.

1282
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Because it would have been, I was, we were bleeding as a company.

1283
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
But they were, the blood I was trying to keep in.

1284
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.000
It would have been easier just to let them decide what they wanted to do after and hindsight,

1285
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000
telling them where we were as a company, how the recession had affected us.

1286
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
But I didn't.

1287
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
And so I divided and conquered.

1288
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Meaning I got to my goal.

1289
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Drive to the first one's house.

1290
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Knock on the door.

1291
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
John.

1292
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000
We're going to talk or you have no job.

1293
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
John still with me right now.

1294
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
He works for Origin.

1295
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Sweet.

1296
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
I was pissed.

1297
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
I was so pissed.

1298
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
I was crying a little bit.

1299
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
I was pissed.

1300
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000
You've been so pissed like you're just like, you cried.

1301
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Yes.

1302
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Negative.

1303
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Next question.

1304
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Really?

1305
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000
I don't know.

1306
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I don't know.

1307
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
I don't know.

1308
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
I guess I guess I'm talking about being a kid.

1309
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Seven.

1310
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
I'm talking like 20, what am I?

1311
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
23, 24, something like that.

1312
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Yes.

1313
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
I was in the deems at that point.

1314
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Yeah.

1315
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Okay.

1316
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
It's not happening.

1317
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
This is a one talk to.

1318
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Yeah.

1319
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Yeah.

1320
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Echo.

1321
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
I'm having a conversation with you.

1322
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
I know.

1323
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
I really like this.

1324
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
I hope that you have the kind of behavior you

1325
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
have of every kid.

1326
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000
I've been lying to you.

1327
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.04
It's like you are the only one he's in

1328
00:55:19.04 --> 00:55:19.000
alguns to say

1329
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000
are you lonely?

1330
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Who's it?

1331
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Who's it?

1332
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.32
When I was a kid, I had one mentor, my buddy's father,

1333
00:55:27.32 --> 00:55:30.72
because it was a single mom who was,

1334
00:55:30.72 --> 00:55:34.44
just we, our kids, we a lot of the time we raised ourselves.

1335
00:55:34.44 --> 00:55:37.32
I didn't have a mentor, now I have a father figure around

1336
00:55:37.32 --> 00:55:42.36
all the time to see how to, so I just, I worked off of

1337
00:55:42.36 --> 00:55:44.52
pure drive and emotion.

1338
00:55:44.52 --> 00:55:47.48
Yeah, yeah, again, I'm not trying to be a jerk.

1339
00:55:47.48 --> 00:55:48.84
No, I'm having fun with it.

1340
00:55:48.84 --> 00:55:49.68
Yeah, absolutely.

1341
00:55:49.68 --> 00:55:52.48
But you're so pissed.

1342
00:55:52.48 --> 00:55:53.32
So pissed.

1343
00:55:53.32 --> 00:55:54.92
You've got freaking tears in your eyes.

1344
00:55:54.92 --> 00:55:55.76
Yeah.

1345
00:55:55.76 --> 00:55:59.20
And you go to John, you fucking, you want this job or not,

1346
00:55:59.20 --> 00:56:02.48
because if you say no, you're not talking to me,

1347
00:56:02.48 --> 00:56:06.76
you do not have a job and you've got a new house.

1348
00:56:06.76 --> 00:56:08.44
Okay, so he had, he's in the car.

1349
00:56:08.44 --> 00:56:09.28
Okay.

1350
00:56:09.28 --> 00:56:11.84
One down, one in the game.

1351
00:56:11.84 --> 00:56:13.04
Still one in the game.

1352
00:56:13.04 --> 00:56:13.88
Got it.

1353
00:56:13.88 --> 00:56:16.92
As I drove to the other's houses,

1354
00:56:16.92 --> 00:56:19.92
they either didn't answer the door and hid

1355
00:56:19.92 --> 00:56:21.92
or answer the door and said, I can't talk to you

1356
00:56:21.92 --> 00:56:22.76
and close to it.

1357
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.96
Okay, so our kids, you know,

1358
00:56:25.96 --> 00:56:26.80
these are kids.

1359
00:56:26.80 --> 00:56:27.64
These are kids.

1360
00:56:27.64 --> 00:56:30.04
Which is a message to everybody.

1361
00:56:30.04 --> 00:56:30.88
Yeah.

1362
00:56:30.88 --> 00:56:33.28
When you don't want to talk to somebody,

1363
00:56:33.28 --> 00:56:34.84
you're not solving anything.

1364
00:56:34.84 --> 00:56:35.68
You don't know what I mean?

1365
00:56:35.68 --> 00:56:36.52
You know what I mean?

1366
00:56:36.52 --> 00:56:37.36
Yeah.

1367
00:56:37.36 --> 00:56:38.44
Now, I'm not saying that there's sometimes

1368
00:56:38.44 --> 00:56:40.60
where I'm so mad at you that I'm like,

1369
00:56:40.60 --> 00:56:42.76
Pete, come back tomorrow, bro,

1370
00:56:42.76 --> 00:56:43.56
because right now,

1371
00:56:43.56 --> 00:56:44.40
anything that goes good?

1372
00:56:44.40 --> 00:56:45.24
Yeah, is that?

1373
00:56:45.24 --> 00:56:45.92
I'm so mad I could cry.

1374
00:56:45.92 --> 00:56:46.76
Yeah.

1375
00:56:46.76 --> 00:56:47.76
I was something like that.

1376
00:56:47.76 --> 00:56:49.56
That sounds really sensitive.

1377
00:56:49.56 --> 00:56:51.000
That would you actually do that?

1378
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
That is a week.

1379
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.08
But that is that the point is though,

1380
00:56:55.08 --> 00:56:57.76
seriously, if there's, if there's a problem

1381
00:56:57.76 --> 00:56:59.32
and you're not going to talk about it,

1382
00:56:59.32 --> 00:57:01.08
you're going to sound like that kid right there,

1383
00:57:01.08 --> 00:57:02.000
that answers the way I came up.

1384
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:02.84
I can't talk to you right now.

1385
00:57:02.84 --> 00:57:03.92
I can shut the door.

1386
00:57:03.92 --> 00:57:06.16
That's that's not a way to get anything solved.

1387
00:57:06.16 --> 00:57:07.88
Are there times where you need a little bit of distance?

1388
00:57:07.88 --> 00:57:08.24
Yeah.

1389
00:57:08.24 --> 00:57:09.24
Because people are hotheaded.

1390
00:57:09.24 --> 00:57:10.24
Yes, that happens.

1391
00:57:10.24 --> 00:57:11.44
As long as you know,

1392
00:57:11.44 --> 00:57:12.68
you're going to,

1393
00:57:12.68 --> 00:57:14.56
you both know that it's not,

1394
00:57:14.56 --> 00:57:15.68
it's solvable,

1395
00:57:15.68 --> 00:57:17.80
you know, like I feel like

1396
00:57:17.80 --> 00:57:20.40
with respect to business and stuff.

1397
00:57:20.40 --> 00:57:22.48
Like, like if you're working with a client,

1398
00:57:22.48 --> 00:57:24.84
you may like bang heads with a client.

1399
00:57:24.84 --> 00:57:25.68
And be like, all right, listen,

1400
00:57:25.68 --> 00:57:27.84
we need to shut this down

1401
00:57:27.84 --> 00:57:30.24
and discuss it like in 48 hours.

1402
00:57:31.12 --> 00:57:33.48
That's learned over time.

1403
00:57:33.48 --> 00:57:34.56
Not when you're a kid.

1404
00:57:34.56 --> 00:57:36.16
You just want to get after like,

1405
00:57:36.16 --> 00:57:39.48
for even your approach was super hardcore.

1406
00:57:39.48 --> 00:57:41.08
And this is again,

1407
00:57:41.08 --> 00:57:42.68
you know, people a little bit aggressive.

1408
00:57:42.68 --> 00:57:45.32
Yeah, people, people want to hear me say like,

1409
00:57:45.32 --> 00:57:46.16
that's right.

1410
00:57:46.16 --> 00:57:48.28
You go in there and you say you either talk to me now

1411
00:57:48.28 --> 00:57:49.84
or you don't have a job.

1412
00:57:49.84 --> 00:57:50.68
Yeah.

1413
00:57:50.68 --> 00:57:51.68
I was already bleeding though.

1414
00:57:51.68 --> 00:57:53.08
So was that the right choice?

1415
00:57:54.08 --> 00:57:56.84
I don't know, but the approach for me would be like,

1416
00:57:56.84 --> 00:58:00.000
hey, let me explain to you what's going on.

1417
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.44
And then you can think more about your decision

1418
00:58:03.44 --> 00:58:06.28
because right now I'm telling you what you've decided

1419
00:58:06.28 --> 00:58:08.96
and what you've presented to me is so far off base

1420
00:58:08.96 --> 00:58:11.88
that if this is what you want to make your decision based on,

1421
00:58:11.88 --> 00:58:13.84
I'm telling you what I'm going to have to do

1422
00:58:13.84 --> 00:58:15.24
is let you go.

1423
00:58:15.24 --> 00:58:16.80
Yeah, because I haven't told you yet,

1424
00:58:16.80 --> 00:58:18.04
but we don't have any money.

1425
00:58:18.04 --> 00:58:20.000
And I'm paying you out of my own pocket.

1426
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.88
So if you don't like that and you don't want me

1427
00:58:21.88 --> 00:58:23.68
to pay you out of my own pocket or any more,

1428
00:58:23.68 --> 00:58:25.56
I'm actually good with that.

1429
00:58:25.56 --> 00:58:26.88
But if you want to have a job and you want to try

1430
00:58:26.88 --> 00:58:29.08
and make this thing work, let's have a conversation.

1431
00:58:29.08 --> 00:58:32.28
And that's close to exactly what I would say now.

1432
00:58:32.28 --> 00:58:33.52
Yeah, exactly.

1433
00:58:33.52 --> 00:58:34.36
100%.

1434
00:58:34.36 --> 00:58:36.56
The reason I'm making this point is that I had a guy

1435
00:58:36.56 --> 00:58:37.72
hit me up on social media.

1436
00:58:37.72 --> 00:58:38.56
Yeah.

1437
00:58:38.56 --> 00:58:39.40
He asked a legit question.

1438
00:58:39.40 --> 00:58:41.20
And he pre-prefaced the question.

1439
00:58:41.20 --> 00:58:45.000
He says, I'm a very direct guy like you.

1440
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Meaning he's direct like me.

1441
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.64
And he says, and I give feedback and it makes people mad

1442
00:58:50.64 --> 00:58:53.04
and rub them the wrong way.

1443
00:58:53.04 --> 00:58:55.40
And I'm just, you know, I wrote back a good look, man.

1444
00:58:55.40 --> 00:59:00.04
I'm direct on Twitter, which is 140 characters.

1445
00:59:00.04 --> 00:59:05.76
And I'm answering 720 questions in rapid fire.

1446
00:59:05.76 --> 00:59:07.88
And so yeah, I'm direct when someone says,

1447
00:59:07.88 --> 00:59:12.44
what is your average daily diet consist of?

1448
00:59:12.44 --> 00:59:12.96
Steak.

1449
00:59:12.96 --> 00:59:13.80
Next one.

1450
00:59:13.80 --> 00:59:14.64
You know what I mean?

1451
00:59:14.64 --> 00:59:16.36
Yeah, but you're direct you're not an asshole.

1452
00:59:16.36 --> 00:59:19.16
But that's also like I'm having fun.

1453
00:59:19.16 --> 00:59:22.32
Like that's the fun part of, you know, interacting

1454
00:59:22.32 --> 00:59:24.20
with people through social media.

1455
00:59:24.20 --> 00:59:27.44
That's not how I'm treating another human being face-to-face

1456
00:59:27.44 --> 00:59:29.04
in a real relationship when we're trying to build something.

1457
00:59:29.04 --> 00:59:31.64
Then I'm using tact, I'm using maneuvering.

1458
00:59:31.64 --> 00:59:32.48
Of course.

1459
00:59:32.48 --> 00:59:34.48
But nitpulating the situation, I'm setting things up.

1460
00:59:34.48 --> 00:59:36.20
I'm being the most tactful person.

1461
00:59:36.20 --> 00:59:39.44
In fact, not only am I not gonna rub them the wrong way,

1462
00:59:39.44 --> 00:59:41.60
I'm gonna rub them in a very nice way.

1463
00:59:41.60 --> 00:59:44.16
So they feel good about the conversation that we had.

1464
00:59:44.16 --> 00:59:46.56
Disarmum and how real things are actually.

1465
00:59:46.56 --> 00:59:50.56
The point is is that, you know, you're, you, like you said,

1466
00:59:50.56 --> 00:59:54.76
what my little quote was is what you would say now.

1467
00:59:54.76 --> 00:59:57.44
Back then, you're young, you're bleeding.

1468
00:59:57.44 --> 00:59:58.44
I'm bleeding.

1469
00:59:58.44 --> 00:59:59.24
You pissed off.

1470
00:59:59.24 --> 00:59:59.92
Yeah.

1471
00:59:59.92 --> 01:00:02.96
And you say, you know, wife nagging at me about finances.

1472
01:00:02.96 --> 01:00:04.68
Yeah, you know how that all builds.

1473
01:00:04.68 --> 01:00:07.52
Two young kids don't sleep through the night.

1474
01:00:07.52 --> 01:00:12.52
You know, it gets tricky and you're trying to maintain this.

1475
01:00:12.52 --> 01:00:16.96
So just FYI, what you just said, you just said,

1476
01:00:16.96 --> 01:00:18.20
you know how it is.

1477
01:00:18.20 --> 01:00:20.12
And to be honest with you, I don't know how that is.

1478
01:00:20.12 --> 01:00:21.80
Because I was in the military.

1479
01:00:21.80 --> 01:00:23.44
I got to pay it check every two weeks.

1480
01:00:23.44 --> 01:00:24.28
I had kids.

1481
01:00:24.28 --> 01:00:25.64
I had health insurance taken care of.

1482
01:00:25.64 --> 01:00:27.08
I had house taken care of.

1483
01:00:27.08 --> 01:00:33.08
It's, it's a huge, it's, it's, it's actually a feeling I don't know.

1484
01:00:33.08 --> 01:00:35.60
So I, yeah, don't know that feeling.

1485
01:00:35.60 --> 01:00:41.40
I can only imagine, I can only imagine what I would be thinking

1486
01:00:41.40 --> 01:00:46.36
if I was in your shoes at 22 years old with a wife to screaming kids.

1487
01:00:46.36 --> 01:00:48.24
And I don't have any money.

1488
01:00:48.24 --> 01:00:50.28
So yeah, check.

1489
01:00:50.28 --> 01:00:51.28
OK.

1490
01:00:51.28 --> 01:00:52.08
And I get some.

1491
01:00:52.08 --> 01:00:54.16
I will tell you about that feeling.

1492
01:00:54.16 --> 01:00:57.28
It's a feeling I'm never going to go back to.

1493
01:00:57.28 --> 01:01:02.48
As we, as I divided and conquered, it did not go my way.

1494
01:01:05.68 --> 01:01:09.12
So meaning that the people were saying they can't talk

1495
01:01:09.12 --> 01:01:09.72
or they hit.

1496
01:01:09.72 --> 01:01:10.16
They can't talk.

1497
01:01:10.16 --> 01:01:11.16
They went, they laughed.

1498
01:01:11.16 --> 01:01:15.52
They're having their homes, whatever.

1499
01:01:15.52 --> 01:01:17.20
So I made a decision what to do.

1500
01:01:17.20 --> 01:01:21.20
When I told, talk to my wife, she's like, what are we going to do?

1501
01:01:21.20 --> 01:01:28.28
I said, well, I said they all think they're expendable, accept.

1502
01:01:28.28 --> 01:01:34.48
They're not because there's not a person in this world that is so good.

1503
01:01:34.48 --> 01:01:36.48
Oh, they can't be replaced.

1504
01:01:36.48 --> 01:01:37.48
They can't be replaced.

1505
01:01:37.48 --> 01:01:38.48
You got it.

1506
01:01:38.48 --> 01:01:40.36
They're not expendable.

1507
01:01:40.36 --> 01:01:43.04
There's not a person's world that is so good at their job.

1508
01:01:43.04 --> 01:01:45.16
They can't be replaced.

1509
01:01:45.16 --> 01:01:46.16
Do you hear that echo?

1510
01:01:46.16 --> 01:01:47.16
Yes.

1511
01:01:47.16 --> 01:01:48.16
Just to say.

1512
01:01:48.16 --> 01:01:50.16
Almost none.

1513
01:01:50.16 --> 01:01:51.16
But you're right.

1514
01:01:51.16 --> 01:01:55.52
There's a lot of talent that people in the world.

1515
01:01:55.52 --> 01:01:57.48
So what did I do?

1516
01:01:57.48 --> 01:02:00.32
hefty trash bags.

1517
01:02:00.32 --> 01:02:02.32
Get some.

1518
01:02:02.32 --> 01:02:08.20
I went up to that studio and I scraped their desks individually into trash bags.

1519
01:02:08.20 --> 01:02:10.28
I didn't even think it felt good.

1520
01:02:10.28 --> 01:02:13.48
I didn't even mean to say that like, but it felt good.

1521
01:02:13.48 --> 01:02:14.48
Yeah.

1522
01:02:14.48 --> 01:02:18.44
I literally scraped it, tied it up.

1523
01:02:18.44 --> 01:02:19.44
Went to the next one.

1524
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:22.88
My wife just pushed it all into the bag.

1525
01:02:22.88 --> 01:02:24.44
This was good.

1526
01:02:24.44 --> 01:02:25.44
Derpy.

1527
01:02:25.44 --> 01:02:26.44
Yep.

1528
01:02:26.44 --> 01:02:27.44
We dragged all the shot.

1529
01:02:27.44 --> 01:02:29.96
I don't care what they had on their desks.

1530
01:02:29.96 --> 01:02:32.60
My property.

1531
01:02:32.60 --> 01:02:36.20
Your shit in the trash bags.

1532
01:02:36.20 --> 01:02:39.04
And organized nothing is scraped.

1533
01:02:39.04 --> 01:02:41.44
Drag them down the stairs.

1534
01:02:41.44 --> 01:02:42.44
Gently.

1535
01:02:42.44 --> 01:02:45.44
Because I'm getting a feeling this was not a drag.

1536
01:02:45.44 --> 01:02:46.84
Them down the stairs.

1537
01:02:46.84 --> 01:02:53.92
We were in this studio, you know, third floor studio that we had built out for us.

1538
01:02:53.92 --> 01:02:54.92
Beautiful.

1539
01:02:54.92 --> 01:02:57.92
Right.

1540
01:02:57.92 --> 01:03:03.64
That Monday morning, the art director who I cut my teeth with came down.

1541
01:03:03.64 --> 01:03:05.80
He lived in Bangor, Maine.

1542
01:03:05.80 --> 01:03:12.28
He said Bangor came down and we were sitting there and it was glass, like the glass.

1543
01:03:12.28 --> 01:03:18.80
And it's like you can see through it being inside, but from the outside you can't.

1544
01:03:18.80 --> 01:03:22.92
They all get out of the same vehicle kind of giggling and chuckling.

1545
01:03:22.92 --> 01:03:24.16
They own me.

1546
01:03:24.16 --> 01:03:26.52
They own this company.

1547
01:03:26.52 --> 01:03:30.84
And they walked in the door and then we were sitting there with a trash bags.

1548
01:03:30.84 --> 01:03:35.56
And they went from.

1549
01:03:35.56 --> 01:03:43.64
He was in the city to guilty, to sadness, and their faces turned white.

1550
01:03:43.64 --> 01:03:45.26
There's your shit.

1551
01:03:45.26 --> 01:03:48.60
Take it.

1552
01:03:48.60 --> 01:03:50.24
Now's it?

1553
01:03:50.24 --> 01:03:51.40
Done.

1554
01:03:51.40 --> 01:03:52.72
That was tough.

1555
01:03:52.72 --> 01:04:00.40
I said a few words.

1556
01:04:00.40 --> 01:04:05.40
I was not going to be held hostage to this situation.

1557
01:04:09.40 --> 01:04:14.40
In business, I say you've got like 40 years of being a maker.

1558
01:04:14.40 --> 01:04:17.40
I did a speech recently at an innovation.

1559
01:04:17.40 --> 01:04:20.40
I wrote a speech for an innovation expo.

1560
01:04:20.40 --> 01:04:25.40
You know, zero to 20 year learning, 20 to 60 year doing

1561
01:04:25.40 --> 01:04:30.40
and 60 to 80, hopefully you're enjoying the fruits of your labor.

1562
01:04:30.40 --> 01:04:33.40
Anything good in life takes 10 years.

1563
01:04:33.40 --> 01:04:38.40
So my first 10 years had passed, but I still had 30 to go.

1564
01:04:38.40 --> 01:04:41.40
And so I knew I wasn't done,

1565
01:04:41.40 --> 01:04:47.40
but the pain of the situation in the experience

1566
01:04:47.40 --> 01:04:50.40
I grew exponentially overnight.

1567
01:04:50.40 --> 01:04:56.40
We had salvaged a small part of the company,

1568
01:04:56.40 --> 01:05:00.40
which was this webware.

1569
01:05:00.40 --> 01:05:02.40
It was like online software.

1570
01:05:02.40 --> 01:05:04.40
Everything is now, like the cloud.

1571
01:05:04.40 --> 01:05:06.40
But there was no cloud.

1572
01:05:06.40 --> 01:05:08.40
There was this system.

1573
01:05:08.40 --> 01:05:13.40
I was able to salvage that because it had a cool little customer base

1574
01:05:13.40 --> 01:05:14.40
of some high-end customers.

1575
01:05:14.40 --> 01:05:15.40
They paid monthly.

1576
01:05:15.40 --> 01:05:17.40
It was just like reoccurring payments,

1577
01:05:17.40 --> 01:05:22.40
just to use it.

1578
01:05:22.40 --> 01:05:25.40
And so I found a buyer for it

1579
01:05:25.40 --> 01:05:29.40
and the negotiation took a long time.

1580
01:05:29.40 --> 01:05:32.40
And in that long time we had no income,

1581
01:05:32.40 --> 01:05:33.40
no money.

1582
01:05:33.40 --> 01:05:35.40
And so what did I do?

1583
01:05:35.40 --> 01:05:38.40
I started selling shit, dirt bikes,

1584
01:05:38.40 --> 01:05:41.40
four wheelers, snowmobiles.

1585
01:05:41.40 --> 01:05:46.40
Every non-essential item I owned got sold.

1586
01:05:46.40 --> 01:05:50.40
I was trying to maintain keeping my home,

1587
01:05:50.40 --> 01:05:55.40
which we had built my wife and I in the forest,

1588
01:05:55.40 --> 01:05:57.40
which was our dream home,

1589
01:05:57.40 --> 01:06:01.40
just a tiny little 1500 square foot timber frame.

1590
01:06:01.40 --> 01:06:07.40
Borrowing money from family and in our parents.

1591
01:06:07.40 --> 01:06:10.40
And then knowing the situation where and so,

1592
01:06:10.40 --> 01:06:15.40
them actually just like giving us food or whatever.

1593
01:06:15.40 --> 01:06:19.40
That whole time I had the maintain like this super composure

1594
01:06:19.40 --> 01:06:22.40
to try and sell this thing.

1595
01:06:22.40 --> 01:06:26.40
All this shit happening in the background.

1596
01:06:26.40 --> 01:06:29.40
And I think it was like eight months.

1597
01:06:29.40 --> 01:06:31.40
And I finally sold it.

1598
01:06:31.40 --> 01:06:34.40
200,000 dollars I think it was.

1599
01:06:34.40 --> 01:06:42.40
Which was cheap for what we had built.

1600
01:06:42.40 --> 01:06:45.40
Extremely cheap.

1601
01:06:45.40 --> 01:06:50.40
But I was in a position where we had nothing left.

1602
01:06:50.40 --> 01:06:53.40
Had freaking nothing left.

1603
01:06:53.40 --> 01:06:57.40
You know.

1604
01:06:57.40 --> 01:07:00.40
It was super, super challenging.

1605
01:07:00.40 --> 01:07:04.40
And I could have easily turned to substance abuse,

1606
01:07:04.40 --> 01:07:08.40
which I never been into substances.

1607
01:07:08.40 --> 01:07:12.40
I could have easily just fell off the deep end

1608
01:07:12.40 --> 01:07:14.40
and felt like a failure,

1609
01:07:14.40 --> 01:07:19.40
which I knew I wasn't.

1610
01:07:19.40 --> 01:07:21.40
My wife wanted me to go find a job.

1611
01:07:21.40 --> 01:07:23.40
She's like, that's what I was about to say.

1612
01:07:23.40 --> 01:07:24.40
I can't do this normal.

1613
01:07:24.40 --> 01:07:26.40
You go get it 95.

1614
01:07:26.40 --> 01:07:28.40
Actually I can't do this.

1615
01:07:28.40 --> 01:07:29.40
I can't do this, Pete.

1616
01:07:29.40 --> 01:07:31.40
I can't do this.

1617
01:07:31.40 --> 01:07:33.40
During that eight months,

1618
01:07:33.40 --> 01:07:35.40
you've got to figure something I said,

1619
01:07:35.40 --> 01:07:39.40
I'm not going to be a team.

1620
01:07:39.40 --> 01:07:43.40
I will find a way to make this work.

1621
01:07:43.40 --> 01:07:47.40
And I believe everything happens for a reason.

1622
01:07:47.40 --> 01:07:49.40
It happened for a reason.

1623
01:07:49.40 --> 01:07:52.40
And I just kept that in the back of my head.

1624
01:07:52.40 --> 01:07:56.40
And I pushed and pushed forward.

1625
01:07:56.40 --> 01:07:58.40
And it wasn't freaking easy.

1626
01:07:58.40 --> 01:08:00.40
Like it was super, super hard.

1627
01:08:00.40 --> 01:08:02.40
Like on us.

1628
01:08:02.40 --> 01:08:07.40
But she stood by me.

1629
01:08:07.40 --> 01:08:09.40
Unwavering.

1630
01:08:09.40 --> 01:08:12.40
She stood by me.

1631
01:08:12.40 --> 01:08:15.40
Never once did she want to leave.

1632
01:08:15.40 --> 01:08:20.40
Did she.

1633
01:08:20.40 --> 01:08:23.40
Not believe in me.

1634
01:08:23.40 --> 01:08:28.40
Or not trust me, which is what I needed.

1635
01:08:28.40 --> 01:08:32.40
And like I said earlier about filling the glass back up.

1636
01:08:32.40 --> 01:08:33.40
It was empty.

1637
01:08:33.40 --> 01:08:36.40
It was bone, freaking dry.

1638
01:08:36.40 --> 01:08:37.40
Bone dry.

1639
01:08:37.40 --> 01:08:40.40
And she just put a little bit back in.

1640
01:08:40.40 --> 01:08:43.40
And we kept moving and kept chugging.

1641
01:08:43.40 --> 01:08:47.40
Now during that time period where you're looking to sell

1642
01:08:47.40 --> 01:08:49.40
the old company.

1643
01:08:49.40 --> 01:08:52.40
Are you hatching plans?

1644
01:08:52.40 --> 01:08:55.40
Or is you got to be 100% focused on just selling my stuff on my

1645
01:08:55.40 --> 01:08:58.40
fresh coastery with getting these pools back five hours

1646
01:08:58.40 --> 01:09:01.40
in completelylege.

1647
01:09:01.40 --> 01:09:08.90
And it's always just that problems called your

1648
01:09:08.90 --> 01:09:11.40
own heart,시간ion.

1649
01:09:11.40 --> 01:09:11.40
I wanted to say that it gateway and company,

1650
01:09:11.40 --> 01:09:15.40
so it obviously did thing that'd really have

1651
01:09:15.40 --> 01:09:18.08
gotten using this contract before it took for me to

1652
01:09:18.08 --> 01:09:20.28
get a lot of money to sign up for that contract.

1653
01:09:20.28 --> 01:09:23.40
But it never spent money out of accounting for me.

1654
01:09:23.40 --> 01:09:28.52
a negative thought, I would just push through it, I just pushed through the thought and

1655
01:09:28.52 --> 01:09:36.08
what got me through a lot of that was training GJ2 where I could expel my energy and use

1656
01:09:36.08 --> 01:09:39.28
my creativity which I thought I had lost in GJ2.

1657
01:09:39.28 --> 01:09:49.48
It's a very creative sport art and that kind of kept me, I guess I kept those endorphins

1658
01:09:49.48 --> 01:09:54.92
flowing so I could maintain some stability.

1659
01:09:54.92 --> 01:09:57.92
But tactically, your focus is sell.

1660
01:09:57.92 --> 01:10:00.52
It's got to make it look good.

1661
01:10:00.52 --> 01:10:04.08
Let's show them the numbers that are coming in for our few clients and what the projections

1662
01:10:04.08 --> 01:10:05.08
could be.

1663
01:10:05.08 --> 01:10:06.08
That's all you're doing.

1664
01:10:06.08 --> 01:10:07.08
That's all you're doing.

1665
01:10:07.08 --> 01:10:10.60
And you're thinking when you sell that thing, you're going to have enough and you'll

1666
01:10:10.60 --> 01:10:12.72
figure it out later which I'm not worried about right now.

1667
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:13.72
Exactly.

1668
01:10:13.72 --> 01:10:16.08
So, you make the sale.

1669
01:10:16.08 --> 01:10:20.40
I made the sale for the first year we get a monthly check.

1670
01:10:20.40 --> 01:10:24.48
It's like five grand a month or something.

1671
01:10:24.48 --> 01:10:28.40
Not the full amount, just like five grand a month.

1672
01:10:28.40 --> 01:10:36.84
So during that time I decided to just take 12 months and figure out what comes next.

1673
01:10:36.84 --> 01:10:44.000
And in that 12 months I traveled around the country, training GJ2 and filming a thing

1674
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.96
we call BJJ weekly because that's what I was passionate about.

1675
01:10:48.96 --> 01:10:53.24
And so we traveled around and filmed technique and trained and all this stuff.

1676
01:10:53.24 --> 01:10:56.68
And it was like an excuse to train GJ2.

1677
01:10:56.68 --> 01:10:57.68
That's it.

1678
01:10:57.68 --> 01:10:59.28
This newsletter.

1679
01:10:59.28 --> 01:11:07.96
And after that 12 months and traveling around it just struck me what I wanted to do.

1680
01:11:07.96 --> 01:11:14.20
Years earlier I had designed this logo for a G-brand.

1681
01:11:14.20 --> 01:11:18.12
Off the cuff came to me, I get my ideas in the morning.

1682
01:11:18.12 --> 01:11:24.08
One morning I sat down and just boom done five minutes.

1683
01:11:24.08 --> 01:11:29.12
Sometimes you can have a client come in, we used to and I spent a hundred hours on the

1684
01:11:29.12 --> 01:11:31.32
frid and logo.

1685
01:11:31.32 --> 01:11:33.40
People don't realize how much logo is cost.

1686
01:11:33.40 --> 01:11:37.44
And sometimes you just nail it like ten minutes done finished.

1687
01:11:37.44 --> 01:11:41.12
Just like getting hit by lightning just boom done.

1688
01:11:41.12 --> 01:11:45.36
And that's what happened with this origin thing.

1689
01:11:45.36 --> 01:11:49.76
I wanted to start a brand because what I had done and what I had learned and over that

1690
01:11:49.76 --> 01:11:59.88
year of driving around and training and reconnecting with myself and my family was that

1691
01:11:59.88 --> 01:12:05.84
I loved building brands and products.

1692
01:12:05.84 --> 01:12:13.44
I loved taking something from nothing like a drawing and making it into something.

1693
01:12:13.44 --> 01:12:22.000
And I had an aversion to the screen and that space because of the new media thing.

1694
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.32
I was always on a screen and I told the man I need to like do something physically,

1695
01:12:30.32 --> 01:12:31.92
like have something physical.

1696
01:12:31.92 --> 01:12:37.60
I need to have a physical thing to do because I was an art major and I'm an artist and

1697
01:12:37.60 --> 01:12:39.68
I zip up goal posts.

1698
01:12:39.68 --> 01:12:42.16
I need a thing to do so.

1699
01:12:42.16 --> 01:12:46.48
In Gigi Tu, I had seen that the uniform like hadn't changed.

1700
01:12:46.48 --> 01:12:47.48
I don't know.

1701
01:12:47.48 --> 01:12:49.84
They've been wearing kimonos for a thousand years.

1702
01:12:49.84 --> 01:12:55.36
But you know, judo, you know, hundreds of years, Gigi Tu, a hundred years and Brazil,

1703
01:12:55.36 --> 01:12:59.32
same thing, same thing, same thing, 100% cotton uniform.

1704
01:12:59.32 --> 01:13:03.32
This is what you wear.

1705
01:13:03.32 --> 01:13:08.84
You got under armor with like wicking stuff and you've got air helmets instead of leather

1706
01:13:08.84 --> 01:13:14.44
helmets and you know, just all these innovations and other sports and judo had shit.

1707
01:13:14.44 --> 01:13:15.44
We had nothing.

1708
01:13:15.44 --> 01:13:21.24
Like wearing a bunch of just straight cotton balls and you know, sweaty, soaked in Gigi,

1709
01:13:21.24 --> 01:13:24.96
that stretches and stinks bad.

1710
01:13:24.96 --> 01:13:26.96
It sucked.

1711
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:31.000
So to start, I was like, okay, I got to start.

1712
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.44
Meaning you now the vision.

1713
01:13:34.44 --> 01:13:36.92
You see that Gigi's haven't progressed.

1714
01:13:36.92 --> 01:13:40.08
You know that they can be made better.

1715
01:13:40.08 --> 01:13:44.36
But you don't actually answer, you say, okay, I want to make the best Gigi in the world.

1716
01:13:44.36 --> 01:13:45.68
Yeah, that's the vision.

1717
01:13:45.68 --> 01:13:47.04
Yes, it is.

1718
01:13:47.04 --> 01:13:48.52
And you have to start somewhere.

1719
01:13:48.52 --> 01:13:49.68
You got to start somewhere.

1720
01:13:49.68 --> 01:13:55.80
So I didn't know anything about textiles, but I knew about design and I knew about the human

1721
01:13:55.80 --> 01:13:59.88
body and you know, how the human body worked.

1722
01:13:59.88 --> 01:14:04.20
And in college sports, you learned about that a lot, you know, mechanics, mechanics of the

1723
01:14:04.20 --> 01:14:07.76
body and they, they retrain you how to run in college.

1724
01:14:07.76 --> 01:14:09.40
Like they you all run the same.

1725
01:14:09.40 --> 01:14:10.40
You do exercises.

1726
01:14:10.40 --> 01:14:12.48
So you're all striking forage striking with your foot.

1727
01:14:12.48 --> 01:14:15.24
You all run the same.

1728
01:14:15.24 --> 01:14:18.92
And so I designed like a G-pan, so it was like the cowboy cut.

1729
01:14:18.92 --> 01:14:23.92
Because I knew that in Gigi too when you're like you're squatting a lot and underneath

1730
01:14:23.92 --> 01:14:28.96
and the material pulled up your leg, but pulled down your butt.

1731
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:34.24
So you're like, got plumbers crack, which sucks.

1732
01:14:34.24 --> 01:14:37.24
So I designed like so the knee pads came up to your hip.

1733
01:14:37.24 --> 01:14:40.24
So when you squat it, it would pull from your hips, right?

1734
01:14:40.24 --> 01:14:43.40
Instead of a cross to the top of your leg.

1735
01:14:43.40 --> 01:14:45.44
And did some cool innovations like that.

1736
01:14:45.44 --> 01:14:48.32
And then I was like, all right, time to go.

1737
01:14:48.32 --> 01:14:53.80
So we launched a Gigi at, we imported the ski from Pakistan.

1738
01:14:53.80 --> 01:15:00.12
And I was in the basement of my house.

1739
01:15:00.12 --> 01:15:01.56
And I was like, we're going to start this brand.

1740
01:15:01.56 --> 01:15:06.20
So I hit the basement sucked.

1741
01:15:06.20 --> 01:15:07.20
Here comes the key.

1742
01:15:07.20 --> 01:15:08.20
We shot a photo.

1743
01:15:08.20 --> 01:15:14.56
We saw some photos off it and I launched it through BTAJ weekly and boom, 40 grand.

1744
01:15:14.56 --> 01:15:18.88
I was like, wow, which you didn't have any Gis.

1745
01:15:18.88 --> 01:15:19.88
No.

1746
01:15:19.88 --> 01:15:28.20
No Gis, but I wanted to prove that we could do something different.

1747
01:15:28.20 --> 01:15:30.68
And I trusted I could make it happen.

1748
01:15:30.68 --> 01:15:32.20
No way, having a Gis.

1749
01:15:32.20 --> 01:15:36.32
There's like 200 Gis sold.

1750
01:15:36.32 --> 01:15:37.32
I've got something here.

1751
01:15:37.32 --> 01:15:42.52
I've got something good here.

1752
01:15:42.52 --> 01:15:45.80
And I knew a new adventure was going to start.

1753
01:15:45.80 --> 01:15:49.000
And my wife spun up.

1754
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Was it in a positive way?

1755
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
No.

1756
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.20
Oh.

1757
01:15:54.20 --> 01:15:57.32
She just like, what are you doing?

1758
01:15:57.32 --> 01:16:00.84
I'm like I'm starting a Gieberhand.

1759
01:16:00.84 --> 01:16:02.76
And she like got sick.

1760
01:16:02.76 --> 01:16:04.76
Like I don't know, she might have an anxiety attack.

1761
01:16:04.76 --> 01:16:08.56
And that first, like you can't do this again.

1762
01:16:08.56 --> 01:16:11.04
You can't, you can't start another company.

1763
01:16:11.04 --> 01:16:13.68
It's like, just.

1764
01:16:13.68 --> 01:16:20.52
And I used this word lightly being around a war hero like you, which is no war hero here.

1765
01:16:20.52 --> 01:16:21.52
I promise you that.

1766
01:16:21.52 --> 01:16:24.72
PTSD of business.

1767
01:16:24.72 --> 01:16:27.12
That's a real thing.

1768
01:16:27.12 --> 01:16:33.24
Like she had like PTSD of business because of what we had gone through and selling everything

1769
01:16:33.24 --> 01:16:38.56
in the feeling you get, that you keep this feeling.

1770
01:16:38.56 --> 01:16:44.64
For me, I used it for drive, for her, she used it for, I don't ever want to feel that

1771
01:16:44.64 --> 01:16:46.000
again.

1772
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.92
That makes me like ill.

1773
01:16:48.92 --> 01:16:51.84
For me, it was like, I'm never going to feel that again.

1774
01:16:51.84 --> 01:16:54.72
I'm going to make sure I never feel that again.

1775
01:16:54.72 --> 01:16:56.24
And I'm going to do something about it.

1776
01:16:56.24 --> 01:16:59.68
So I did it anyway.

1777
01:16:59.68 --> 01:17:02.28
Started a company, origin.

1778
01:17:02.28 --> 01:17:08.24
And that's when it began 2011.

1779
01:17:08.24 --> 01:17:13.000
So how do you start it?

1780
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.48
So you got one key.

1781
01:17:14.48 --> 01:17:18.72
Well, you sold 40 grand worth of one key that you didn't have.

1782
01:17:18.72 --> 01:17:20.72
What's what did you do next?

1783
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:22.96
Did you know at this point you wanted to make them in America?

1784
01:17:22.96 --> 01:17:23.96
Had you figured that part out?

1785
01:17:23.96 --> 01:17:24.96
No, no.

1786
01:17:24.96 --> 01:17:27.96
I, let me take that.

1787
01:17:27.96 --> 01:17:28.96
Or you figured you'd make them in America.

1788
01:17:28.96 --> 01:17:31.24
I wanted to make them in America.

1789
01:17:31.24 --> 01:17:36.84
And so I started like calling all the factories and in Maine.

1790
01:17:36.84 --> 01:17:38.72
Hey, you know, you guys so stuff.

1791
01:17:38.72 --> 01:17:39.72
Yeah, cool.

1792
01:17:39.72 --> 01:17:40.72
Can you sew this?

1793
01:17:40.72 --> 01:17:41.72
No.

1794
01:17:41.72 --> 01:17:42.72
Okay.

1795
01:17:42.72 --> 01:17:49.32
So we don't know Maine has traditionally had a lot of industry up here, manufacturing.

1796
01:17:49.32 --> 01:17:50.32
Big time.

1797
01:17:50.32 --> 01:17:55.52
Especially when we were kids, big brands up here that build a lot.

1798
01:17:55.52 --> 01:17:56.80
They're all kinds of stuff.

1799
01:17:56.80 --> 01:17:59.16
Bass shoe 10 minutes away.

1800
01:17:59.16 --> 01:18:00.16
Sold out.

1801
01:18:00.16 --> 01:18:02.96
Dexter shoe, Hayden shoe, Lou Hayden.

1802
01:18:02.96 --> 01:18:05.52
You don't say it until you shoot past away.

1803
01:18:05.52 --> 01:18:08.12
And huge companies, L.O.B.

1804
01:18:08.12 --> 01:18:12.16
New Balance 20 minutes away.

1805
01:18:12.16 --> 01:18:16.36
So rich heritage and manufacturing.

1806
01:18:16.36 --> 01:18:18.84
But a peril in Maine.

1807
01:18:18.84 --> 01:18:19.84
A little different.

1808
01:18:19.84 --> 01:18:23.36
We made shoes and we wolf fabric and stuff like that.

1809
01:18:23.36 --> 01:18:25.52
But a peril wasn't the norm.

1810
01:18:25.52 --> 01:18:30.08
So what I did is we were in that basement and we're like, okay.

1811
01:18:30.08 --> 01:18:33.64
And I just got to make this note that all those, a lot of those companies that you're talking

1812
01:18:33.64 --> 01:18:35.08
about that had built all the stuff.

1813
01:18:35.08 --> 01:18:37.92
And we're all those years, a lot of them had left.

1814
01:18:37.92 --> 01:18:38.92
Yeah.

1815
01:18:38.92 --> 01:18:43.72
So that's the, I, I, all of the situation except all of them had left.

1816
01:18:43.72 --> 01:18:44.62
L.O.B.

1817
01:18:44.62 --> 01:18:48.20
And they still make some stuff here.

1818
01:18:48.20 --> 01:18:50.20
The rest left gone.

1819
01:18:50.20 --> 01:18:52.000
So you balance still make some stuff here too.

1820
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Yeah, new balance.

1821
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Oh yeah, for sure.

1822
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.48
Yeah, new balance is awesome.

1823
01:18:56.48 --> 01:19:00.84
So I was like, okay.

1824
01:19:00.84 --> 01:19:02.48
We're gonna make a belt.

1825
01:19:02.48 --> 01:19:03.48
That's what we're gonna do.

1826
01:19:03.48 --> 01:19:04.48
We're gonna make a belt.

1827
01:19:04.48 --> 01:19:05.48
Did you do belt?

1828
01:19:05.48 --> 01:19:06.48
Yeah.

1829
01:19:06.48 --> 01:19:12.56
So there was this guy in Louis, then, who ran this company.

1830
01:19:12.56 --> 01:19:15.84
And I called him up and like, I need some sewing machines.

1831
01:19:15.84 --> 01:19:21.36
He's like, okay, well, why don't you stop by and Louis, then, Maine, one of the manufacturing

1832
01:19:21.36 --> 01:19:25.000
hubs of Maine at one time, walked in and he's like, what do you need?

1833
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.44
I was like, this is what I want to make.

1834
01:19:27.44 --> 01:19:29.04
It's a belt for martial arts.

1835
01:19:29.04 --> 01:19:30.04
He's like, okay.

1836
01:19:30.04 --> 01:19:33.48
And I said, I just need some machine to do that.

1837
01:19:33.48 --> 01:19:35.28
And like, I got 500 bucks cash.

1838
01:19:35.28 --> 01:19:37.000
I can spend on it.

1839
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.92
Can you give me something to practice with?

1840
01:19:40.92 --> 01:19:45.28
And so he sold me a machine, showed me how to thread the bob in.

1841
01:19:45.28 --> 01:19:47.24
Showed me where it went, pulled through the needle.

1842
01:19:47.24 --> 01:19:50.36
And I'm like, okay, okay, we filmed it.

1843
01:19:50.36 --> 01:19:51.96
So we knew how to do it.

1844
01:19:51.96 --> 01:19:53.36
So we're like filming him doing this.

1845
01:19:53.36 --> 01:19:56.60
And I'm like, okay, so we took the sewing machine and then I put it in my basement.

1846
01:19:56.60 --> 01:19:58.48
Next to the desk and I'm like, yeah.

1847
01:19:58.48 --> 01:20:01.000
That's so amazing.

1848
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.44
And my wife was just like, shaking her head.

1849
01:20:06.44 --> 01:20:09.52
Luckily, luckily we had sold a pre-order.

1850
01:20:09.52 --> 01:20:14.04
So we had sold $40,000 in Giz that didn't exist.

1851
01:20:14.04 --> 01:20:18.92
So she had gotten off my back a little bit.

1852
01:20:18.92 --> 01:20:20.92
So that machinery sat there.

1853
01:20:20.92 --> 01:20:24.36
And as we looked at trying to make this key.

1854
01:20:24.36 --> 01:20:26.16
And I didn't say, oh, we're going to make a key in America.

1855
01:20:26.16 --> 01:20:27.36
I just said, right, we're going to make a key.

1856
01:20:27.36 --> 01:20:29.88
We're going to change the key.

1857
01:20:29.88 --> 01:20:32.28
We're going to change the key first.

1858
01:20:32.28 --> 01:20:36.20
So we started the import game.

1859
01:20:36.20 --> 01:20:37.72
Everybody else is doing it.

1860
01:20:37.72 --> 01:20:41.08
Everybody's telling me manufacturers dead.

1861
01:20:41.08 --> 01:20:43.28
I did a few phone calls.

1862
01:20:43.28 --> 01:20:46.48
Pretty much everybody's like, yeah, you can't really do that.

1863
01:20:46.48 --> 01:20:51.64
And so I was like, okay, you know, at the whole time I'm thinking like, something's

1864
01:20:51.64 --> 01:20:55.60
not right here that I can't do this.

1865
01:20:55.60 --> 01:21:00.68
And I just couldn't put my finger on what it was.

1866
01:21:00.68 --> 01:21:09.20
So I imported in 2011 and May we started in 2011 and into 2012.

1867
01:21:09.20 --> 01:21:10.88
Then a few batches did the whole.

1868
01:21:10.88 --> 01:21:13.000
Hey, limited edition batch thing.

1869
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.76
Giz, but we promoted it with the innovations we had.

1870
01:21:17.76 --> 01:21:19.76
It was still shit.

1871
01:21:19.76 --> 01:21:21.16
When it comes right down to it.

1872
01:21:21.16 --> 01:21:22.16
What the key was?

1873
01:21:22.16 --> 01:21:23.16
Yeah, man.

1874
01:21:23.16 --> 01:21:24.16
It was still shit.

1875
01:21:24.16 --> 01:21:26.16
I'm using old textiles.

1876
01:21:26.16 --> 01:21:27.16
I have to exist.

1877
01:21:27.16 --> 01:21:31.88
So do you design, you said you imported one from Pakistan and then what do you do?

1878
01:21:31.88 --> 01:21:35.28
Like, cut it up and redesign it or something or did you send the design to them?

1879
01:21:35.28 --> 01:21:39.32
And they, so I designed like everything in a little straight.

1880
01:21:39.32 --> 01:21:41.04
Like a tech like I want this here.

1881
01:21:41.04 --> 01:21:42.04
I want the knee pads here.

1882
01:21:42.04 --> 01:21:46.000
They've got a fall here, the belt loops because I don't want to untie the, all this

1883
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
stuff.

1884
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
And then they send it.

1885
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Yeah.

1886
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Done.

1887
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Yeah.

1888
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Finish.

1889
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.88
So you know in Pakistan, they're like the manufacturing for martial arts.

1890
01:21:57.88 --> 01:22:02.44
It's like the manufacturing hub and this little city called sale cut.

1891
01:22:02.44 --> 01:22:06.56
They're actually like almost like migrant workers as a ton of factories, due to factories.

1892
01:22:06.56 --> 01:22:08.64
But the workers are the same.

1893
01:22:08.64 --> 01:22:10.64
Oh, the same guys in there.

1894
01:22:10.64 --> 01:22:12.24
Yeah, all the same guys they made or whatever.

1895
01:22:12.24 --> 01:22:13.24
They rotate around.

1896
01:22:13.24 --> 01:22:14.24
Oh, yeah.

1897
01:22:14.24 --> 01:22:15.24
Yeah.

1898
01:22:15.24 --> 01:22:16.24
We got a contract over here.

1899
01:22:16.24 --> 01:22:17.24
We're going to make five.

1900
01:22:17.24 --> 01:22:18.24
Yeah, let's go make her Giz.

1901
01:22:18.24 --> 01:22:19.24
Yeah.

1902
01:22:19.24 --> 01:22:19.24
Good bunch of guys show up there.

1903
01:22:19.24 --> 01:22:21.24
They work for pennies and pennies.

1904
01:22:21.24 --> 01:22:21.92
Yep.

1905
01:22:21.92 --> 01:22:27.000
We did the importing thing and we started to grow rapidly.

1906
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.16
We started to make money.

1907
01:22:29.16 --> 01:22:34.96
And at that point, my other business, I was making kind of monthly income and then I got

1908
01:22:34.96 --> 01:22:37.12
kind of like a chunk of money like 100 grand.

1909
01:22:37.12 --> 01:22:38.96
I was like, all right, cool.

1910
01:22:38.96 --> 01:22:44.24
I can like take a deep breath and really push this thing.

1911
01:22:44.24 --> 01:22:50.52
And so I pushed it and we started selling more and more.

1912
01:22:50.52 --> 01:22:55.88
And I came out with this really cool backpack, called a Mondial backpack, Munjial backpack,

1913
01:22:55.88 --> 01:22:56.88
technical backpack.

1914
01:22:56.88 --> 01:22:59.48
And we sold a ton of them, thousands of them.

1915
01:22:59.48 --> 01:23:02.64
And then we came out with this product for grip training.

1916
01:23:02.64 --> 01:23:03.64
We weren't patting anything.

1917
01:23:03.64 --> 01:23:05.60
We were just like, boom, because that's what I did.

1918
01:23:05.60 --> 01:23:08.52
Once I got on the rolls, I was like, design this, design this.

1919
01:23:08.52 --> 01:23:13.72
And we were just selling, selling, selling.

1920
01:23:13.72 --> 01:23:16.40
And during this time, I was also competing.

1921
01:23:16.40 --> 01:23:22.88
Now, because a mail, it's just a no more.

1922
01:23:22.88 --> 01:23:27.24
It's due to you and you want to test yourself against the best in the world.

1923
01:23:27.24 --> 01:23:29.44
So I was training hard.

1924
01:23:29.44 --> 01:23:34.96
I ended up winning the, let me, let me digress for a second.

1925
01:23:34.96 --> 01:23:39.64
I had seen another company release a product for grip training that looked exactly

1926
01:23:39.64 --> 01:23:40.64
like ours.

1927
01:23:40.64 --> 01:23:43.08
What was the product though?

1928
01:23:43.08 --> 01:23:44.08
You're training one?

1929
01:23:44.08 --> 01:23:45.52
Yes, called that a ring hang.

1930
01:23:45.52 --> 01:23:50.52
So it's like the ghee and then calmer and the sleeve.

1931
01:23:50.52 --> 01:23:52.04
Yeah, it was cool.

1932
01:23:52.04 --> 01:23:54.16
It was awesome.

1933
01:23:54.16 --> 01:23:58.44
And I was like, those bastards ripped us off.

1934
01:23:58.44 --> 01:24:01.80
And I wasn't thinking my manufacturer or anything while I was like, man, another company

1935
01:24:01.80 --> 01:24:02.80
ripped us off.

1936
01:24:02.80 --> 01:24:05.84
I should have patented that, you know, blah, blah, blah.

1937
01:24:05.84 --> 01:24:07.84
OK.

1938
01:24:07.84 --> 01:24:09.12
So I was competing.

1939
01:24:09.12 --> 01:24:10.56
I ended up going to Canada.

1940
01:24:10.56 --> 01:24:11.88
I won the World Pro Trials.

1941
01:24:11.88 --> 01:24:13.32
I was a brown belt at the time.

1942
01:24:13.32 --> 01:24:16.84
One of the world pro trials in the Black belt division, because they, you know, they

1943
01:24:16.84 --> 01:24:21.44
put the divisions together as, you know, for that was in 2012.

1944
01:24:21.44 --> 01:24:23.68
Now they, I think they separated them now again.

1945
01:24:23.68 --> 01:24:29.72
But so I got to go over to Abu Dhabi and compete in the World Pro.

1946
01:24:29.72 --> 01:24:35.08
And as a brown belt in that Black belt division.

1947
01:24:35.08 --> 01:24:36.76
I'm sitting there before my match.

1948
01:24:36.76 --> 01:24:43.000
And I'm supposed to fight Shandji Habero and the quarterfinals of the open division.

1949
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:51.16
And I, I, I, I, I'm going to say this.

1950
01:24:51.16 --> 01:24:55.40
It was bad seating like the seating of the brackets was not good.

1951
01:24:55.40 --> 01:24:56.40
OK.

1952
01:24:56.40 --> 01:25:05.52
Um, like, I had in my bracket a guy from Brazil, JT Torres, a Shandji and maybe

1953
01:25:05.52 --> 01:25:06.72
under a Galvan.

1954
01:25:06.72 --> 01:25:09.84
And so JT didn't want to fight.

1955
01:25:09.84 --> 01:25:13.72
So he, so I fought the other kid from Brazil.

1956
01:25:13.72 --> 01:25:17.08
And he was much smaller and I was athletic and good night.

1957
01:25:17.08 --> 01:25:18.92
I ended up winning.

1958
01:25:18.92 --> 01:25:22.48
And then JT just kind of like didn't want to fight.

1959
01:25:22.48 --> 01:25:25.72
So then he coach me against Shandji and we had a war.

1960
01:25:25.72 --> 01:25:26.72
Here's a good man.

1961
01:25:26.72 --> 01:25:29.92
I had it last couple of the second spaddives.

1962
01:25:29.92 --> 01:25:31.92
Very close.

1963
01:25:31.92 --> 01:25:36.20
The problem with the No Shandji is multiple times World Champion from the World.

1964
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:38.80
One of the best of all time, and JT too.

1965
01:25:38.80 --> 01:25:40.48
Big time.

1966
01:25:40.48 --> 01:25:41.48
Awesome guy too.

1967
01:25:41.48 --> 01:25:42.48
Awesome.

1968
01:25:42.48 --> 01:25:43.48
Awesome guy.

1969
01:25:43.48 --> 01:25:45.56
So, but the seating was bad like Lafato was.

1970
01:25:45.56 --> 01:25:47.80
And then it like, there was a couple other guys.

1971
01:25:47.80 --> 01:25:51.28
I don't know, just, if my division could have been tougher and I would have gotten my

1972
01:25:51.28 --> 01:25:52.72
ass kicked a lot earlier.

1973
01:25:52.72 --> 01:25:53.72
OK.

1974
01:25:53.72 --> 01:25:58.000
So, but we had a war and it was awesome.

1975
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.48
And maybe I would have won if I had worked harder.

1976
01:26:02.48 --> 01:26:12.04
Maybe I would have won if that girl from Poland didn't walk by me right before the match

1977
01:26:12.04 --> 01:26:17.48
with an origin Gion and a different logo on the back.

1978
01:26:17.48 --> 01:26:20.24
And what was on your cut of a G.

1979
01:26:20.24 --> 01:26:21.84
Like the G that you designed.

1980
01:26:21.84 --> 01:26:22.84
Yeah.

1981
01:26:22.84 --> 01:26:25.64
And you see a girl from Poland who's competitive competing.

1982
01:26:25.64 --> 01:26:26.64
She walks by.

1983
01:26:26.64 --> 01:26:31.40
Yeah, it was actually, it was the pit, the pants.

1984
01:26:31.40 --> 01:26:32.40
Yeah.

1985
01:26:32.40 --> 01:26:34.84
There's a logo, a different logo on the back.

1986
01:26:34.84 --> 01:26:38.12
But our whole thing, your design, yeah, different logo.

1987
01:26:38.12 --> 01:26:39.12
Yeah.

1988
01:26:39.12 --> 01:26:44.48
I knew it was my manufacturer and then everything clicked.

1989
01:26:44.48 --> 01:26:47.60
They ripped off the orang-hangryp trainers.

1990
01:26:47.60 --> 01:26:48.60
OK.

1991
01:26:48.60 --> 01:26:49.60
OK.

1992
01:26:49.60 --> 01:26:51.20
But what am I to do?

1993
01:26:51.20 --> 01:26:55.36
Because I'm locked into these guys now.

1994
01:26:55.36 --> 01:26:57.72
So I had to strategize.

1995
01:26:57.72 --> 01:27:02.32
So I went out and lost in the quarterfinals.

1996
01:27:02.32 --> 01:27:08.92
Got on an airplane, worse freaking flight of my life.

1997
01:27:08.92 --> 01:27:13.76
Because I'm an ADHD kid and I can't be stuck in a freaking seat for 14 hours.

1998
01:27:13.76 --> 01:27:17.28
That sucks.

1999
01:27:17.28 --> 01:27:20.16
And on the ride back, I was talking to J.T.

2000
01:27:20.16 --> 01:27:22.76
Who I'd become good friends with.

2001
01:27:22.76 --> 01:27:24.88
He was kind of like in a tricky position in life.

2002
01:27:24.88 --> 01:27:28.80
He was still with his instructor in Maryland.

2003
01:27:28.80 --> 01:27:30.52
And just didn't know what to do.

2004
01:27:30.52 --> 01:27:31.76
He wasn't progressing.

2005
01:27:31.76 --> 01:27:34.56
And he was telling me, man, I've got to get,

2006
01:27:34.56 --> 01:27:37.88
like, I have to do it full work out before I can actually

2007
01:27:37.88 --> 01:27:40.56
train with the guys because he was so good.

2008
01:27:40.56 --> 01:27:43.44
He just wasn't getting it.

2009
01:27:43.44 --> 01:27:44.96
And you know the mecca of J.T.

2010
01:27:44.96 --> 01:27:49.60
Who you know is California.

2011
01:27:49.60 --> 01:27:51.60
I'll do this so far as to say San Diego.

2012
01:27:51.60 --> 01:27:52.40
San Diego.

2013
01:27:52.40 --> 01:27:53.000
That's where you went.

2014
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.48
That's where you went.

2015
01:27:54.48 --> 01:27:56.60
So he was figuring his whole thing out.

2016
01:27:56.60 --> 01:27:57.60
So cal for sure.

2017
01:27:57.60 --> 01:27:58.44
So cal.

2018
01:27:58.44 --> 01:27:59.12
Yeah.

2019
01:27:59.12 --> 01:28:01.28
He was figuring his whole thing out.

2020
01:28:01.28 --> 01:28:03.68
And I was I'm thinking about it's like this,

2021
01:28:03.68 --> 01:28:08.60
probably I'm like man, I think I'm going to build a factory.

2022
01:28:08.60 --> 01:28:10.32
I'm wearing the airplane.

2023
01:28:10.32 --> 01:28:13.68
I was like he's looking to be like, yeah,

2024
01:28:13.68 --> 01:28:15.08
I want to build a factory.

2025
01:28:15.08 --> 01:28:17.24
Screw this shit.

2026
01:28:17.24 --> 01:28:18.32
This is bullshit.

2027
01:28:18.32 --> 01:28:19.72
I said, I'm not competing anymore.

2028
01:28:19.72 --> 01:28:21.08
I'm done.

2029
01:28:21.08 --> 01:28:22.88
And all of a sudden he wanted to do his win the World Champion

2030
01:28:22.88 --> 01:28:23.08
ship.

2031
01:28:23.08 --> 01:28:25.28
So we kind of like helped each other a little bit

2032
01:28:25.28 --> 01:28:29.000
in that plane ride back, like kind of bouncing ideas

2033
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.84
off each other.

2034
01:28:30.84 --> 01:28:33.92
Decompression, decompression.

2035
01:28:33.92 --> 01:28:40.92
So I got back and I skyped my manufacturer.

2036
01:28:42.20 --> 01:28:47.32
And I was like over skyped.

2037
01:28:47.32 --> 01:28:49.64
Like this is bullshit.

2038
01:28:50.76 --> 01:28:53.44
You freaking, I didn't say that.

2039
01:28:53.44 --> 01:28:58.28
So you fucking ripped off our intellectual property

2040
01:28:58.28 --> 01:29:02.40
and sold it to other brands.

2041
01:29:02.40 --> 01:29:05.48
And he said business is business.

2042
01:29:06.68 --> 01:29:07.52
Dang.

2043
01:29:07.52 --> 01:29:08.96
You ever have a defining moment in your life

2044
01:29:08.96 --> 01:29:11.76
where you just turn on and you're like,

2045
01:29:11.76 --> 01:29:13.40
yep, done.

2046
01:29:14.76 --> 01:29:17.28
I knew at that moment what we were going to do.

2047
01:29:17.28 --> 01:29:20.36
Like it was clear.

2048
01:29:20.36 --> 01:29:22.28
It became clear.

2049
01:29:22.28 --> 01:29:24.04
And I knew the challenge in front of me

2050
01:29:24.04 --> 01:29:25.48
and I knew it wasn't sane.

2051
01:29:25.48 --> 01:29:27.16
And I knew it couldn't be done.

2052
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:29.60
And I was like, it's happening.

2053
01:29:29.60 --> 01:29:31.88
Props.

2054
01:29:31.88 --> 01:29:40.36
So I got to tell you a little bit of what happened right

2055
01:29:40.36 --> 01:29:41.000
after that.

2056
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.68
Right after that, I went out to the World Championships

2057
01:29:44.68 --> 01:29:48.56
to compete because I had already signed up.

2058
01:29:48.56 --> 01:29:51.04
And that was going to be my year.

2059
01:29:51.04 --> 01:29:56.04
We were there and there was this brand there.

2060
01:29:56.04 --> 01:29:59.68
And I walked up and I walked by and I did double take.

2061
01:29:59.68 --> 01:30:02.68
I was like, what?

2062
01:30:02.68 --> 01:30:03.88
And I looked for the right.

2063
01:30:03.88 --> 01:30:07.68
And there's our Mundial technical backpack right there.

2064
01:30:07.68 --> 01:30:09.48
But with friends.

2065
01:30:09.48 --> 01:30:11.72
With send their logo on it.

2066
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:18.72
I went up to the guy and I was like, dude, I said,

2067
01:30:18.72 --> 01:30:21.92
got an original idea.

2068
01:30:21.92 --> 01:30:25.28
And everybody there's a badass except for this guy who doesn't

2069
01:30:25.28 --> 01:30:26.68
do Gigi's youth.

2070
01:30:26.68 --> 01:30:28.76
Who does nothing, right?

2071
01:30:28.76 --> 01:30:32.52
Just some chubby dude who wants to capitalize on the success

2072
01:30:32.52 --> 01:30:36.40
of combat sports and Gigi's who's growth in California.

2073
01:30:36.40 --> 01:30:38.40
And I'm not going to name the company.

2074
01:30:38.40 --> 01:30:41.20
And I was like, that is a week.

2075
01:30:41.20 --> 01:30:44.20
I said in bullshit.

2076
01:30:44.20 --> 01:30:48.16
I said, get some original friggin' ideas.

2077
01:30:48.16 --> 01:30:51.92
I went down, walked down in myself and the deco

2078
01:30:51.92 --> 01:30:53.20
our business partner.

2079
01:30:53.20 --> 01:30:57.16
And Nia, his wife and my wife were down there.

2080
01:30:57.16 --> 01:31:02.16
And I told my wife, in spin, did she ever?

2081
01:31:04.16 --> 01:31:09.16
She went up there and she flipped out on the guy.

2082
01:31:09.16 --> 01:31:14.16
A man to bring it, she bringing it five, two, 103 pounds.

2083
01:31:14.16 --> 01:31:19.16
A fury.

2084
01:31:19.16 --> 01:31:22.16
It was awesome.

2085
01:31:22.16 --> 01:31:25.16
We flew back and the picture was already clear.

2086
01:31:25.16 --> 01:31:31.16
This was just like added motivation, just added motivation.

2087
01:31:31.16 --> 01:31:36.16
I called one of my buddies Tim and John was already working for me

2088
01:31:36.16 --> 01:31:39.16
from my last business, the sole survivor, the sole survivor,

2089
01:31:39.16 --> 01:31:43.16
moved back to Farmington.

2090
01:31:43.16 --> 01:31:47.16
Well, we did as you grab that, that tape you put around trees.

2091
01:31:47.16 --> 01:31:51.16
And you want to flag trees to cut and you got to flag the trees to cut.

2092
01:31:51.16 --> 01:31:53.16
We kind of have like, I had John.

2093
01:31:53.16 --> 01:31:57.16
I have seven acres of property, which is, okay, listen, seven acres

2094
01:31:57.16 --> 01:31:59.16
is not a lot of property and main.

2095
01:31:59.16 --> 01:32:04.16
You can buy property and main for $500 an acre in some places, private sale.

2096
01:32:04.16 --> 01:32:06.16
So let's just make that clear.

2097
01:32:06.16 --> 01:32:09.16
Seven acres is not a lot.

2098
01:32:09.16 --> 01:32:12.16
But we have seven acres of land in the woods.

2099
01:32:12.16 --> 01:32:14.16
And so I like flagged out.

2100
01:32:14.16 --> 01:32:17.16
I'm like, we're going to build a factory here.

2101
01:32:17.16 --> 01:32:20.16
We just flagged it out like this.

2102
01:32:20.16 --> 01:32:23.16
And this is based on the architectural design that you're engineered

2103
01:32:23.16 --> 01:32:24.16
put through for your factory.

2104
01:32:24.16 --> 01:32:25.16
Yeah.

2105
01:32:25.16 --> 01:32:26.16
All right.

2106
01:32:26.16 --> 01:32:30.16
So he was like, I think a factory should be about this big.

2107
01:32:30.16 --> 01:32:31.16
Yeah.

2108
01:32:31.16 --> 01:32:33.16
This looks like a factory size.

2109
01:32:33.16 --> 01:32:34.16
So awesome.

2110
01:32:34.16 --> 01:32:37.16
I call the buddy any brothers chains are over.

2111
01:32:37.16 --> 01:32:39.16
And they're just like, I just do it.

2112
01:32:39.16 --> 01:32:42.16
And we just started cutting trees.

2113
01:32:42.16 --> 01:32:45.16
My father and I came over with a chipper.

2114
01:32:45.16 --> 01:32:47.16
We chipped it out.

2115
01:32:47.16 --> 01:32:48.16
Okay, we stumped it.

2116
01:32:48.16 --> 01:32:50.16
We pulled a stump out.

2117
01:32:50.16 --> 01:32:51.16
We're pretty resourceful up in here.

2118
01:32:51.16 --> 01:32:55.16
And maybe you ever heard Yankee ingenuity that term.

2119
01:32:55.16 --> 01:32:56.16
For sure.

2120
01:32:56.16 --> 01:32:58.16
That happens.

2121
01:32:58.16 --> 01:33:01.16
So what do we do?

2122
01:33:01.16 --> 01:33:02.16
We cleared it.

2123
01:33:02.16 --> 01:33:05.16
We did a little bit of earthwork.

2124
01:33:05.16 --> 01:33:08.16
I got on the compactor and compacted all the sand.

2125
01:33:08.16 --> 01:33:13.16
And Portus Lab had had some some guy, some company.

2126
01:33:13.16 --> 01:33:17.16
Saw her out a bunch of Eastern white pine.

2127
01:33:17.16 --> 01:33:21.16
And had my buddy build a barn factory.

2128
01:33:21.16 --> 01:33:22.16
Barn.

2129
01:33:22.16 --> 01:33:26.16
And we just spent, I don't know, 1868.

2130
01:33:26.16 --> 01:33:29.16
I don't know how many hours we slept in zero hours.

2131
01:33:29.16 --> 01:33:32.16
Around the clock, we just built this thing from the ground up.

2132
01:33:32.16 --> 01:33:35.16
Myself, my brother, friends, family.

2133
01:33:35.16 --> 01:33:38.16
That was just, we did it. We built it.

2134
01:33:38.16 --> 01:33:41.16
That was stuck a sewing machine in there.

2135
01:33:41.16 --> 01:33:43.16
That's what we've seen.

2136
01:33:43.16 --> 01:33:44.16
That's what we've done.

2137
01:33:44.16 --> 01:33:46.16
We're like, what are we doing?

2138
01:33:46.16 --> 01:33:48.16
That's where it began.

2139
01:33:48.16 --> 01:33:54.16
And the thing is, if you listen, I'm all for planning.

2140
01:33:54.16 --> 01:34:00.16
I like to plan what's going to happen in there.

2141
01:34:00.16 --> 01:34:03.16
Like to execute that plan.

2142
01:34:03.16 --> 01:34:05.16
But do it.

2143
01:34:05.16 --> 01:34:08.16
And I like to lead the plan.

2144
01:34:08.16 --> 01:34:12.16
And I'm shitty when it comes to like,

2145
01:34:12.16 --> 01:34:15.16
I'm always making sure everybody's living up to their expectations.

2146
01:34:15.16 --> 01:34:17.16
Like as part of the plan, if they bought into it,

2147
01:34:17.16 --> 01:34:19.16
you better fully bought into it.

2148
01:34:19.16 --> 01:34:21.16
There's no room for like slacking.

2149
01:34:21.16 --> 01:34:24.16
Like if I'm working to midnight, you're working to midnight.

2150
01:34:24.16 --> 01:34:26.16
Right? You're not leaving.

2151
01:34:26.16 --> 01:34:28.16
So that's what we did.

2152
01:34:28.16 --> 01:34:31.16
And I'm a pusher to you, like a push push push push.

2153
01:34:31.16 --> 01:34:35.16
Like to see how much I can get out of somebody to push them to their potential.

2154
01:34:35.16 --> 01:34:37.16
And see where their breaking point is.

2155
01:34:37.16 --> 01:34:42.16
So I can learn about the person, but also get the best out of them.

2156
01:34:42.16 --> 01:34:44.16
So we did it. We built a factory.

2157
01:34:44.16 --> 01:34:49.16
And that's where it started.

2158
01:34:49.16 --> 01:34:52.16
So then comes what's next sewing machines?

2159
01:34:52.16 --> 01:34:53.16
Yeah.

2160
01:34:53.16 --> 01:34:54.16
And sewing machines.

2161
01:34:54.16 --> 01:34:57.16
And just started looking for staff that knew how to sell.

2162
01:34:57.16 --> 01:34:58.16
Yeah.

2163
01:34:58.16 --> 01:34:59.16
Exactly.

2164
01:34:59.16 --> 01:35:02.16
So we didn't have any lights yet. We had one sewing machine.

2165
01:35:02.16 --> 01:35:04.16
And we just like, okay, this is how we're doing.

2166
01:35:04.16 --> 01:35:05.16
This is how you sew.

2167
01:35:05.16 --> 01:35:08.16
And I found this old time or bill who came down.

2168
01:35:08.16 --> 01:35:10.16
And he's like explaining the different types.

2169
01:35:10.16 --> 01:35:11.16
He's been in the business for 40 years.

2170
01:35:11.16 --> 01:35:13.16
Bixing sewing machines.

2171
01:35:13.16 --> 01:35:16.16
And he's just like, you know, when is that X?

2172
01:35:16.16 --> 01:35:17.16
And he's like, you know, you got that.

2173
01:35:17.16 --> 01:35:19.16
We got a single needle machine.

2174
01:35:19.16 --> 01:35:20.16
A double needle.

2175
01:35:20.16 --> 01:35:22.16
And you've got the locking stitch and a chain stitch.

2176
01:35:22.16 --> 01:35:23.16
And you know, all this stuff.

2177
01:35:23.16 --> 01:35:25.16
And I'm just like, whoa.

2178
01:35:25.16 --> 01:35:32.16
And so I just absorbed. It got, it became completely absorbed in that, right?

2179
01:35:32.16 --> 01:35:34.16
Learning about sewing machines.

2180
01:35:34.16 --> 01:35:37.16
I learned how to run them, how to fix them.

2181
01:35:37.16 --> 01:35:39.16
What they were good for.

2182
01:35:39.16 --> 01:35:43.16
The different types of feeding, you know, all, all, everything about sewing machines.

2183
01:35:43.16 --> 01:35:45.16
How's that cool? I know about sewing machines.

2184
01:35:45.16 --> 01:35:47.16
Now we need some fabric.

2185
01:35:49.16 --> 01:35:51.16
So I started looking for fabric.

2186
01:35:51.16 --> 01:35:58.16
Guess what? They don't make fabric in the United States.

2187
01:35:58.16 --> 01:36:02.16
They don't make fabric that we needed in Mexico.

2188
01:36:02.16 --> 01:36:05.16
They don't make fabric in Canada.

2189
01:36:05.16 --> 01:36:08.16
Shit, they don't make fabric for Gigi's.

2190
01:36:08.16 --> 01:36:13.16
And I was like, what are we going to do?

2191
01:36:13.16 --> 01:36:16.16
What would you do?

2192
01:36:16.16 --> 01:36:18.16
You just built a factory.

2193
01:36:18.16 --> 01:36:22.16
And you have all these sewing machines.

2194
01:36:22.16 --> 01:36:24.16
And what would you do?

2195
01:36:24.16 --> 01:36:29.16
So you're only option at this point is got an order of the material from the order of the material from what we've seen.

2196
01:36:29.16 --> 01:36:31.16
So you got it. That's what you're going to do.

2197
01:36:31.16 --> 01:36:32.16
Right?

2198
01:36:32.16 --> 01:36:34.16
I was like screw that.

2199
01:36:34.16 --> 01:36:36.16
And so I started looking for like weaving.

2200
01:36:36.16 --> 01:36:41.16
And so I just, you know, was looking for weaving like, hey, hey, hey, hey, you guys, we've

2201
01:36:41.16 --> 01:36:49.16
been doing these a far or far as 100,000 yards, you know, 12 bucks yard.

2202
01:36:49.16 --> 01:36:52.16
No.

2203
01:36:52.16 --> 01:36:54.16
So I'm just looking, looking, looking.

2204
01:36:54.16 --> 01:36:56.16
And did you ever order any material?

2205
01:36:56.16 --> 01:36:57.16
I did.

2206
01:36:57.16 --> 01:36:59.16
Okay, because you had to sell Gigi's.

2207
01:36:59.16 --> 01:37:00.16
I mean, I had to make some money.

2208
01:37:00.16 --> 01:37:02.16
We got investment into this thing now.

2209
01:37:02.16 --> 01:37:02.16
Right.

2210
01:37:02.16 --> 01:37:07.16
And I didn't take a paycheck for like the first two years of business.

2211
01:37:07.16 --> 01:37:08.16
I didn't take a paycheck.

2212
01:37:08.16 --> 01:37:09.16
Maybe three.

2213
01:37:09.16 --> 01:37:11.16
I didn't pay myself once.

2214
01:37:11.16 --> 01:37:16.16
Every dime I just dump back in, dump back in, dump back in.

2215
01:37:16.16 --> 01:37:19.16
Weaving was impossible.

2216
01:37:19.16 --> 01:37:20.16
Right?

2217
01:37:20.16 --> 01:37:22.16
You're not going to freaking weave material.

2218
01:37:22.16 --> 01:37:23.16
So I did.

2219
01:37:23.16 --> 01:37:26.16
I imported material for that first year.

2220
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:31.16
And we figured out how to make a Gigi.

2221
01:37:31.16 --> 01:37:34.16
And it was a pain in the ass.

2222
01:37:34.16 --> 01:37:37.16
And that first week.

2223
01:37:37.16 --> 01:37:39.16
We finished the week.

2224
01:37:39.16 --> 01:37:41.16
And I called to deco.

2225
01:37:41.16 --> 01:37:43.16
And I said,

2226
01:37:43.16 --> 01:37:47.16
we made five pairs of pants this week.

2227
01:37:47.16 --> 01:37:51.16
And he's like not really high production.

2228
01:37:51.16 --> 01:37:54.16
Dude, I was just like, what am I doing?

2229
01:37:54.16 --> 01:37:57.16
And I kind of started telling that story.

2230
01:37:57.16 --> 01:37:59.16
You like legit or questioning.

2231
01:37:59.16 --> 01:38:00.16
Oh, I spiral down.

2232
01:38:00.16 --> 01:38:02.16
Like, oh, my God.

2233
01:38:02.16 --> 01:38:05.16
You know, you thought you were going to make 200 G's in the week.

2234
01:38:05.16 --> 01:38:06.16
Or G pants.

2235
01:38:06.16 --> 01:38:10.16
And we can make five, five pairs of pants.

2236
01:38:10.16 --> 01:38:14.16
I was just mind boggling.

2237
01:38:14.16 --> 01:38:15.16
Mind boggling.

2238
01:38:15.16 --> 01:38:17.16
And Jill was my first teacher.

2239
01:38:17.16 --> 01:38:18.16
She's still with us today.

2240
01:38:18.16 --> 01:38:21.16
The one you were talking about earlier.

2241
01:38:21.16 --> 01:38:24.16
Dude, I did not know what to do.

2242
01:38:24.16 --> 01:38:27.16
I was truly at a loss for.

2243
01:38:27.16 --> 01:38:33.16
I didn't have anybody to teach me about how to manufacture.

2244
01:38:33.16 --> 01:38:36.16
And I was like, how you should set this up.

2245
01:38:36.16 --> 01:38:40.16
Because the knowledge had disappeared out of the state.

2246
01:38:40.16 --> 01:38:41.16
It was gone.

2247
01:38:41.16 --> 01:38:43.16
The folks that used to do that stuff either.

2248
01:38:43.16 --> 01:38:46.16
They passed or they moved on.

2249
01:38:46.16 --> 01:38:47.16
They're still birds.

2250
01:38:47.16 --> 01:38:48.16
They moved to Florida.

2251
01:38:48.16 --> 01:38:49.16
Whatever.

2252
01:38:49.16 --> 01:38:51.16
They weren't around.

2253
01:38:51.16 --> 01:38:59.16
So I had a lot of late nights by myself in my basement.

2254
01:38:59.16 --> 01:39:01.16
With a glass of whiskey.

2255
01:39:01.16 --> 01:39:10.16
I started to have that feeling come back.

2256
01:39:10.16 --> 01:39:13.16
Of that like failure feeling.

2257
01:39:13.16 --> 01:39:19.16
And I didn't know what to do.

2258
01:39:19.16 --> 01:39:23.16
I was like, what did I get myself into?

2259
01:39:23.16 --> 01:39:26.16
You know, like, what are you doing?

2260
01:39:26.16 --> 01:39:30.16
Like, how do you, what am I doing?

2261
01:39:30.16 --> 01:39:37.16
And then I figured, like, I cannot.

2262
01:39:37.16 --> 01:39:45.16
Basically, like, I can't do this alone type of situation.

2263
01:39:45.16 --> 01:39:48.16
And in a conversation with my father and a house like,

2264
01:39:48.16 --> 01:39:50.16
Joe, man, I need to talk to somebody who's like,

2265
01:39:50.16 --> 01:39:53.16
Ben there and done that and like,

2266
01:39:53.16 --> 01:39:55.16
done built something from nothing.

2267
01:39:55.16 --> 01:39:59.16
And he's like, PD's like, I've got a friend that he did some work for.

2268
01:39:59.16 --> 01:40:00.16
And his bulldozer.

2269
01:40:00.16 --> 01:40:01.16
My father loves to have me mechanical.

2270
01:40:01.16 --> 01:40:04.16
I've been machinery mechanic.

2271
01:40:04.16 --> 01:40:07.16
And so we made a phone call to this guy, John.

2272
01:40:07.16 --> 01:40:09.16
I'll leave his last name out.

2273
01:40:09.16 --> 01:40:13.16
And John said, yeah, I'll meet with Pete.

2274
01:40:13.16 --> 01:40:15.16
He said, here's the date and time.

2275
01:40:15.16 --> 01:40:18.16
Meet me at my lake house.

2276
01:40:18.16 --> 01:40:20.16
So I showed up at his lake house.

2277
01:40:20.16 --> 01:40:23.16
And I sat down and he shook my hand.

2278
01:40:23.16 --> 01:40:26.16
And he said, let me tell you something.

2279
01:40:26.16 --> 01:40:29.16
You're not fucking special.

2280
01:40:29.16 --> 01:40:31.16
I'm already Pete down.

2281
01:40:31.16 --> 01:40:34.16
Just, I'm using his words.

2282
01:40:34.16 --> 01:40:37.16
You're not fucking special.

2283
01:40:37.16 --> 01:40:39.16
Your ideas aren't special.

2284
01:40:39.16 --> 01:40:42.16
And nobody gives his shit.

2285
01:40:42.16 --> 01:40:44.16
I was like, okay.

2286
01:40:44.16 --> 01:40:46.16
Motivational speaker.

2287
01:40:46.16 --> 01:40:47.16
Get an after it.

2288
01:40:47.16 --> 01:40:49.16
No, nobody gives his shit.

2289
01:40:49.16 --> 01:40:51.16
They said, reality check.

2290
01:40:51.16 --> 01:40:54.16
Yeah, I was like, oh shit.

2291
01:40:54.16 --> 01:40:57.16
He goes, what's your problem?

2292
01:40:57.16 --> 01:41:03.16
I said, man, I, we need money to, like, he was like, no, you don't.

2293
01:41:03.16 --> 01:41:08.16
I said, no, we need money to do this.

2294
01:41:08.16 --> 01:41:11.16
To learn how to do this and build this and, like, make this happen.

2295
01:41:11.16 --> 01:41:15.16
I need money, the capital.

2296
01:41:15.16 --> 01:41:16.16
He goes, Pete.

2297
01:41:16.16 --> 01:41:19.16
Were you in the back of your mind thinking you had good capital investor right here?

2298
01:41:19.16 --> 01:41:21.16
Is it a big guy with Lake Allison?

2299
01:41:21.16 --> 01:41:23.16
Maybe this guy's going to throw you,

2300
01:41:23.16 --> 01:41:25.16
do you, geez, at you?

2301
01:41:25.16 --> 01:41:26.16
No.

2302
01:41:26.16 --> 01:41:27.16
No.

2303
01:41:27.16 --> 01:41:29.16
I wasn't there for financial.

2304
01:41:29.16 --> 01:41:31.16
A financial.

2305
01:41:31.16 --> 01:41:33.16
I wasn't looking for that.

2306
01:41:33.16 --> 01:41:34.16
But that was the solution that you saw.

2307
01:41:34.16 --> 01:41:36.16
You didn't, that's the only solution.

2308
01:41:36.16 --> 01:41:38.16
You just thought, I need money for this thing.

2309
01:41:38.16 --> 01:41:39.16
Only solution.

2310
01:41:39.16 --> 01:41:42.16
I need money.

2311
01:41:42.16 --> 01:41:47.16
And as he kind of like beat me down.

2312
01:41:47.16 --> 01:41:51.16
And this guy ran like a 50, I think they're $100 million company now.

2313
01:41:51.16 --> 01:41:53.16
I thought that point was $50 million.

2314
01:41:53.16 --> 01:41:56.16
And he was kind of retired and doing this thing.

2315
01:41:56.16 --> 01:42:01.16
And giving his time to me for free to help another kid from industry,

2316
01:42:01.16 --> 01:42:06.16
main, succeed.

2317
01:42:06.16 --> 01:42:10.16
He basically educated me.

2318
01:42:10.16 --> 01:42:12.16
And two hours educated me.

2319
01:42:12.16 --> 01:42:19.16
And I walked away from that meeting, like, with a plan, a plan of action.

2320
01:42:19.16 --> 01:42:22.16
What was the big takeaways?

2321
01:42:22.16 --> 01:42:32.16
He told me I need to basically find out who I was and do a personality profile.

2322
01:42:32.16 --> 01:42:37.16
And he goes, you're probably what he say.

2323
01:42:37.16 --> 01:42:40.16
And I and FJ, something like that.

2324
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:43.16
He like guessed it.

2325
01:42:43.16 --> 01:42:46.16
When I in EJ, I'm not even exactly sure what it was.

2326
01:42:46.16 --> 01:42:50.16
I did my personality profile to find out my strengths and weaknesses.

2327
01:42:50.16 --> 01:42:51.16
And it was spot on.

2328
01:42:51.16 --> 01:42:53.16
I was like, oh, he's shit.

2329
01:42:53.16 --> 01:42:55.16
This is kind of like crazy.

2330
01:42:55.16 --> 01:43:02.16
And then he told me, you're not all in.

2331
01:43:02.16 --> 01:43:07.16
You don't really want to win at this.

2332
01:43:07.16 --> 01:43:09.16
I was like, no, I do.

2333
01:43:09.16 --> 01:43:11.16
Then go all in.

2334
01:43:11.16 --> 01:43:12.16
How much do you believe in it?

2335
01:43:12.16 --> 01:43:15.16
Because it's a million freaking people like you.

2336
01:43:15.16 --> 01:43:20.16
He said, there's a million people like you and a million great ideas.

2337
01:43:20.16 --> 01:43:29.16
And less than 1% are willing to go and chase it and go all in and do it.

2338
01:43:29.16 --> 01:43:31.16
Are you one of those people?

2339
01:43:31.16 --> 01:43:39.16
And if you are, solve the money problem and solve the rest of the problems.

2340
01:43:39.16 --> 01:43:46.16
The next day I was at the bank signing my home away with my wife by my side.

2341
01:43:46.16 --> 01:43:50.16
She was stoked for a $200,000 loan.

2342
01:43:50.16 --> 01:43:53.16
That was tougher her.

2343
01:43:53.16 --> 01:43:54.16
Two things.

2344
01:43:54.16 --> 01:43:58.16
As you were saying them, there's a big difference.

2345
01:43:58.16 --> 01:44:01.16
You put them together, which is when you put them together, it makes sense.

2346
01:44:01.16 --> 01:44:07.16
But chasing your goals chasing your dream and being all in.

2347
01:44:07.16 --> 01:44:09.16
It's not the same thing.

2348
01:44:09.16 --> 01:44:14.16
Now, if you're all in and you have to chase it, you don't even know what else to do besides chase it.

2349
01:44:14.16 --> 01:44:19.16
But I think some people they chase it, but they're running like half speed.

2350
01:44:19.16 --> 01:44:20.16
And I was a half speed.

2351
01:44:20.16 --> 01:44:21.16
Yeah.

2352
01:44:21.16 --> 01:44:22.16
It's awesome.

2353
01:44:22.16 --> 01:44:24.16
You got to be uncomfortable.

2354
01:44:24.16 --> 01:44:26.16
That's basically what I took away from that.

2355
01:44:26.16 --> 01:44:27.16
And he's the one that told me.

2356
01:44:27.16 --> 01:44:29.16
He said, Pete, how old are you?

2357
01:44:29.16 --> 01:44:31.16
I said, I'm 30.

2358
01:44:31.16 --> 01:44:33.16
What's your problem?

2359
01:44:33.16 --> 01:44:36.16
I said.

2360
01:44:36.16 --> 01:44:39.16
I'm just going to get John on the podcast at some point.

2361
01:44:39.16 --> 01:44:40.16
I'm stuck.

2362
01:44:40.16 --> 01:44:41.16
Yeah.

2363
01:44:41.16 --> 01:44:42.16
I said, I'm stuck.

2364
01:44:42.16 --> 01:44:47.16
He goes, you got three more chances.

2365
01:44:47.16 --> 01:44:48.16
He's like, I'm 60.

2366
01:44:48.16 --> 01:44:50.16
You got three more chances.

2367
01:44:50.16 --> 01:44:56.16
He's like, if you believe in it, then he's the one that told me everything in life, everything

2368
01:44:56.16 --> 01:44:59.16
great takes 10 years to build.

2369
01:44:59.16 --> 01:45:05.16
Go build it and be committed because it's got to take 10 years to build it.

2370
01:45:05.16 --> 01:45:10.16
But if you believe in it, you have to go all in.

2371
01:45:10.16 --> 01:45:12.16
And if you've got to put up your house, put up your house.

2372
01:45:12.16 --> 01:45:14.16
You'll work your way out of it.

2373
01:45:14.16 --> 01:45:15.16
Eventually.

2374
01:45:15.16 --> 01:45:17.16
So that's what I did.

2375
01:45:17.16 --> 01:45:19.16
I followed his advice.

2376
01:45:19.16 --> 01:45:22.16
And I went all in.

2377
01:45:22.16 --> 01:45:27.16
He also told me the moment you stop growing, you die.

2378
01:45:27.16 --> 01:45:31.16
He said, if you stop growing, you will die.

2379
01:45:31.16 --> 01:45:37.16
The moment you want to do something different than what you're doing.

2380
01:45:37.16 --> 01:45:48.16
The moment your mind wanders to wanting to be somewhere else, your business also dies.

2381
01:45:48.16 --> 01:45:51.16
And you need to recognize that.

2382
01:45:51.16 --> 01:45:57.16
And that first meeting with him was just, it just changed my, changed my game.

2383
01:45:57.16 --> 01:46:04.16
And when I signed my name on that loan, when I signed my home to the bank to receive that check,

2384
01:46:04.16 --> 01:46:10.16
I was laser focused.

2385
01:46:10.16 --> 01:46:18.16
It's like being in the woods on an early morning hunt when it's dark in the sun is coming up

2386
01:46:18.16 --> 01:46:21.16
and the leaves go.

2387
01:46:21.16 --> 01:46:22.16
Right.

2388
01:46:22.16 --> 01:46:29.16
The sun hits the leaves, hits the trees and you're waiting for the deer for whatever you're

2389
01:46:29.16 --> 01:46:30.16
hunting.

2390
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:33.16
That's what I felt like about business.

2391
01:46:33.16 --> 01:46:42.16
The same feeling you get from that I felt laser focused in it's like everything just opened up.

2392
01:46:42.16 --> 01:46:48.16
Like my mind opened like the synapses connected in I was like a new, a new, a new,

2393
01:46:48.16 --> 01:46:52.16
I knew I was like new.

2394
01:46:52.16 --> 01:46:54.16
And that's what I mean by like you can't hear.

2395
01:46:54.16 --> 01:46:55.16
At least born in entrepreneur.

2396
01:46:55.16 --> 01:46:57.16
You're not born in entrepreneur.

2397
01:46:57.16 --> 01:47:02.16
You need to get punched in the face and John punched me right in the nose.

2398
01:47:02.16 --> 01:47:07.16
It was awesome.

2399
01:47:07.16 --> 01:47:14.16
So the next step is you order some material, but that's not your long term plan.

2400
01:47:14.16 --> 01:47:18.16
And the next thing you do is you go we got to make this material.

2401
01:47:18.16 --> 01:47:21.16
We got to make this material.

2402
01:47:21.16 --> 01:47:28.16
I had called every use textile company in the United States, every use textile company

2403
01:47:28.16 --> 01:47:32.16
to try and find this machinery.

2404
01:47:32.16 --> 01:47:36.16
We had to weave our own fabric.

2405
01:47:36.16 --> 01:47:41.16
It wasn't a sustainable model without weaving our own fabric.

2406
01:47:41.16 --> 01:47:45.16
They were all like, she's not going to happen.

2407
01:47:45.16 --> 01:47:48.16
I'm like, what is it to get set up?

2408
01:47:48.16 --> 01:47:51.16
A million dollars, right?

2409
01:47:51.16 --> 01:47:54.16
750 grand.

2410
01:47:54.16 --> 01:47:56.16
This is to buy a brand new loo.

2411
01:47:56.16 --> 01:47:59.16
This is to buy the operational experience in there.

2412
01:47:59.16 --> 01:48:01.16
They're going to send you from the factory after they build this loo.

2413
01:48:01.16 --> 01:48:03.16
They'll send you a guy that's going to help you run it.

2414
01:48:03.16 --> 01:48:05.16
Yeah, we just need a million dollars.

2415
01:48:05.16 --> 01:48:07.16
Yeah, exactly.

2416
01:48:07.16 --> 01:48:09.16
It's just not going to happen.

2417
01:48:09.16 --> 01:48:16.16
I was like, okay, in business, it's like boxing, like it's like the Gitu.

2418
01:48:16.16 --> 01:48:18.16
It's all about the angles.

2419
01:48:18.16 --> 01:48:23.16
You know, when people get so stuck on like one angle, they can only see that one angle.

2420
01:48:23.16 --> 01:48:30.16
And I just had to like, I had to step to the side and I had to see this angle.

2421
01:48:30.16 --> 01:48:33.16
I knew Maine had a heritage in weaving.

2422
01:48:33.16 --> 01:48:37.16
I knew there was weaving here at one point.

2423
01:48:37.16 --> 01:48:41.16
And so I went back to that same old time, reduced in Maine, who had sold me my fur,

2424
01:48:41.16 --> 01:48:46.16
sewing machine, and I sat in his office, and I said,

2425
01:48:46.16 --> 01:48:50.16
No, where there are any looms.

2426
01:48:50.16 --> 01:48:52.16
Is that what you mean?

2427
01:48:52.16 --> 01:48:54.16
A weaving loom?

2428
01:48:54.16 --> 01:48:57.16
Like to weave fabric?

2429
01:48:57.16 --> 01:49:00.16
He goes, getting my truck?

2430
01:49:00.16 --> 01:49:02.16
I get in this truck.

2431
01:49:02.16 --> 01:49:06.16
We drive up one street and get out.

2432
01:49:06.16 --> 01:49:08.16
And this is massive building.

2433
01:49:08.16 --> 01:49:13.16
It's like, I think total square footage was like 1.5 million square feet.

2434
01:49:13.16 --> 01:49:16.16
Mostly abandoned.

2435
01:49:16.16 --> 01:49:20.16
A few businesses in the front that they've refurbished.

2436
01:49:20.16 --> 01:49:23.16
And there's a museum there.

2437
01:49:23.16 --> 01:49:27.16
And then walks in and introduces me to this woman Rachel.

2438
01:49:27.16 --> 01:49:31.16
And he says, Rachel, this is Pete.

2439
01:49:31.16 --> 01:49:33.16
He's looking for a loom.

2440
01:49:33.16 --> 01:49:38.16
And she goes, well, follow me.

2441
01:49:38.16 --> 01:49:40.16
She made me sign a release.

2442
01:49:40.16 --> 01:49:44.16
We went up these stairs and into this old mill five.

2443
01:49:44.16 --> 01:49:47.16
And the floorboards, the windows were all broken.

2444
01:49:47.16 --> 01:49:49.16
The sock tooth building, you know, the sock tooth mill buildings.

2445
01:49:49.16 --> 01:49:50.16
And windows were all broken.

2446
01:49:50.16 --> 01:49:55.16
The wood was all punky and like, like, a bent-op and splinter.

2447
01:49:55.16 --> 01:49:58.16
You had like watch where you're walking.

2448
01:49:58.16 --> 01:50:02.16
And there's this big green nasty thing sitting in the middle of floor.

2449
01:50:02.16 --> 01:50:06.16
Right there in this whole place.

2450
01:50:06.16 --> 01:50:08.16
And we walk over to it.

2451
01:50:08.16 --> 01:50:12.16
She's like, I need to get rid of this.

2452
01:50:12.16 --> 01:50:15.16
And I'm like, this is a loom.

2453
01:50:15.16 --> 01:50:18.16
And she's like, yep.

2454
01:50:18.16 --> 01:50:23.16
She's the holy shit.

2455
01:50:23.16 --> 01:50:26.16
Where's the rest of them?

2456
01:50:26.16 --> 01:50:29.16
They ship them overseas.

2457
01:50:29.16 --> 01:50:32.16
They're company and India bought us bought about $1,000.

2458
01:50:32.16 --> 01:50:34.16
They shipped everything overseas.

2459
01:50:34.16 --> 01:50:36.16
And she goes, I kept this one.

2460
01:50:36.16 --> 01:50:39.16
I kept it here because I wanted to put it in the museum.

2461
01:50:39.16 --> 01:50:42.16
So we didn't lose our heritage.

2462
01:50:42.16 --> 01:50:46.16
I said, can I buy it?

2463
01:50:46.16 --> 01:50:47.16
And she said, yep.

2464
01:50:47.16 --> 01:50:48.16
That's it.

2465
01:50:48.16 --> 01:50:49.16
I'll watch it.

2466
01:50:49.16 --> 01:50:50.16
$3,000.

2467
01:50:50.16 --> 01:50:51.16
That's it.

2468
01:50:51.16 --> 01:50:52.16
Done.

2469
01:50:52.16 --> 01:50:53.16
Man.

2470
01:50:53.16 --> 01:50:56.16
And this was like, I just want to point this out.

2471
01:50:56.16 --> 01:51:00.16
The the the floor is all broken.

2472
01:51:00.16 --> 01:51:01.16
The windows are broken.

2473
01:51:01.16 --> 01:51:03.16
And the loom is like rusty, right?

2474
01:51:03.16 --> 01:51:04.16
Oh, dude.

2475
01:51:04.16 --> 01:51:05.16
This is not like this.

2476
01:51:05.16 --> 01:51:07.16
This thing is disaster.

2477
01:51:07.16 --> 01:51:08.16
When was the last time it was used?

2478
01:51:08.16 --> 01:51:09.16
How many years ago?

2479
01:51:09.16 --> 01:51:11.16
Oh, 80s.

2480
01:51:11.16 --> 01:51:13.16
It was it's in 83.

2481
01:51:13.16 --> 01:51:14.16
It's like a 1983.

2482
01:51:14.16 --> 01:51:16.16
I don't know when the last time it was used.

2483
01:51:16.16 --> 01:51:19.16
But it hadn't been had any to love for it a long long time.

2484
01:51:19.16 --> 01:51:22.16
Most of the parts were stripped off of it.

2485
01:51:22.16 --> 01:51:25.16
It was like a frame just like an infrastructure.

2486
01:51:25.16 --> 01:51:29.16
I said, okay, I'm I'm I'm going to buy this loom.

2487
01:51:29.16 --> 01:51:30.16
Yeah.

2488
01:51:30.16 --> 01:51:39.16
So you've got to be a little bit naive to be in business and think you can accomplish anything.

2489
01:51:39.16 --> 01:51:40.16
That's the bottom line.

2490
01:51:40.16 --> 01:51:50.16
And I was pretty pretty driven and naive to think that we could weave fabric.

2491
01:51:50.16 --> 01:51:54.16
But I believe we could.

2492
01:51:54.16 --> 01:51:56.16
So she sold me it.

2493
01:51:56.16 --> 01:52:00.16
And then I called my father-in-law and I said, I got a loom.

2494
01:52:00.16 --> 01:52:04.16
It's on the third floor of this old mill in Louis,

2495
01:52:04.16 --> 01:52:05.16
in Maine.

2496
01:52:05.16 --> 01:52:08.16
And when he needed to get it out.

2497
01:52:08.16 --> 01:52:12.16
And I got a quote on moving in and it was $25,000 to move it.

2498
01:52:12.16 --> 01:52:14.16
And I'm like we're going to move it.

2499
01:52:14.16 --> 01:52:16.16
And he's like.

2500
01:52:16.16 --> 01:52:17.16
Okay.

2501
01:52:17.16 --> 01:52:19.16
So I got a bunch of friends.

2502
01:52:19.16 --> 01:52:21.16
We went up there.

2503
01:52:21.16 --> 01:52:29.16
Took nine guys, eight hours to move it from the middle to the floor to the edge of the building.

2504
01:52:29.16 --> 01:52:40.16
And we had another friend who had a crane and we ended up getting it out and onto a trailer and put it in the factory.

2505
01:52:40.16 --> 01:52:44.16
And then we were like, well, are we doing dude?

2506
01:52:44.16 --> 01:52:47.16
It was awesome.

2507
01:52:47.16 --> 01:52:48.16
It was awesome.

2508
01:52:48.16 --> 01:52:53.16
So that's where it started.

2509
01:52:53.16 --> 01:53:00.16
You know, I always believe like if it was done, it can be done.

2510
01:53:00.16 --> 01:53:05.16
Like if it, if, if, you know, in Maine, we have this thing like,

2511
01:53:05.16 --> 01:53:08.16
Maine at one point was 90% field.

2512
01:53:08.16 --> 01:53:12.16
How to become 90% field, you know, 100 years ago.

2513
01:53:12.16 --> 01:53:14.16
Hands and daylight.

2514
01:53:14.16 --> 01:53:15.16
Hands and daylight.

2515
01:53:15.16 --> 01:53:16.16
Right?

2516
01:53:16.16 --> 01:53:19.16
So these mill buildings built hands and daylight.

2517
01:53:19.16 --> 01:53:21.16
That's it.

2518
01:53:21.16 --> 01:53:23.16
These people, they got after it.

2519
01:53:23.16 --> 01:53:25.16
I mean, why?

2520
01:53:25.16 --> 01:53:27.16
Because if you don't, you die.

2521
01:53:27.16 --> 01:53:28.16
That's it.

2522
01:53:28.16 --> 01:53:29.16
You're going to die.

2523
01:53:29.16 --> 01:53:30.16
So you've got a farm.

2524
01:53:30.16 --> 01:53:32.16
You've got to know how to build a house.

2525
01:53:32.16 --> 01:53:33.16
You got to know how to start a fire.

2526
01:53:33.16 --> 01:53:38.16
Like that culture of New England is still rich.

2527
01:53:38.16 --> 01:53:40.16
You know, it's still passed down.

2528
01:53:40.16 --> 01:53:41.16
We burn wood.

2529
01:53:41.16 --> 01:53:42.16
Everybody burns wood.

2530
01:53:42.16 --> 01:53:43.16
We build our own shit.

2531
01:53:43.16 --> 01:53:45.16
You know, houses, everything.

2532
01:53:45.16 --> 01:53:46.16
That's what we do.

2533
01:53:46.16 --> 01:53:49.16
Why is everybody saying we can't manufacture.

2534
01:53:49.16 --> 01:53:52.16
We can't, we, we can't cut in the so.

2535
01:53:52.16 --> 01:53:54.16
That's bullshit.

2536
01:53:54.16 --> 01:54:01.16
If they did it, we can do it because they did it with a lot less.

2537
01:54:01.16 --> 01:54:04.16
I found a guy, Lenny.

2538
01:54:04.16 --> 01:54:11.16
When that mill shut down, he had a contract to go over to Pakistan,

2539
01:54:11.16 --> 01:54:14.16
Pakistan of all places.

2540
01:54:14.16 --> 01:54:23.16
To teach them how to run the looms that were purchased.

2541
01:54:23.16 --> 01:54:25.16
And a month later, it was 9-11.

2542
01:54:25.16 --> 01:54:27.16
And he didn't go.

2543
01:54:27.16 --> 01:54:29.16
And he stayed here.

2544
01:54:29.16 --> 01:54:34.16
Thank God because he's the last.

2545
01:54:34.16 --> 01:54:36.16
He's like the last one.

2546
01:54:36.16 --> 01:54:39.16
Left of that can actually get this thing going.

2547
01:54:39.16 --> 01:54:43.16
And make it work again.

2548
01:54:43.16 --> 01:54:48.16
I asked Lenny, how many people know what you know.

2549
01:54:48.16 --> 01:54:51.16
He said, a whole bunch.

2550
01:54:51.16 --> 01:54:52.16
I said, what's a whole bunch?

2551
01:54:52.16 --> 01:54:56.16
He's like a five.

2552
01:54:56.16 --> 01:55:00.16
So he, Lenny passes knowledge on us, weaving,

2553
01:55:00.16 --> 01:55:07.16
pattern making for textiles and all this stuff.

2554
01:55:07.16 --> 01:55:09.16
And that's a whole nother story.

2555
01:55:09.16 --> 01:55:11.16
Maybe for a different time.

2556
01:55:11.16 --> 01:55:14.16
But we started weaving fabric.

2557
01:55:14.16 --> 01:55:16.16
And we became vertically integrated.

2558
01:55:16.16 --> 01:55:19.16
And we started making the product from Rockhawn from textiles.

2559
01:55:19.16 --> 01:55:23.16
What did he feel like the first time that thing created fabric?

2560
01:55:23.16 --> 01:55:25.16
He must have been freed.

2561
01:55:25.16 --> 01:55:30.16
We were just like, he's just like, we had the, we had the,

2562
01:55:30.16 --> 01:55:32.16
like we had to make Pearl weave.

2563
01:55:32.16 --> 01:55:33.16
And so we did.

2564
01:55:33.16 --> 01:55:34.16
We made Pearl weave.

2565
01:55:34.16 --> 01:55:36.16
We looked up Pearl weave of part.

2566
01:55:36.16 --> 01:55:39.16
That was like from the imported fabric.

2567
01:55:39.16 --> 01:55:42.16
We just picked it apart and Lenny looked at it and figured out what?

2568
01:55:42.16 --> 01:55:45.16
Size thread, you know, yarns and the weight and everything.

2569
01:55:45.16 --> 01:55:47.16
So we just recreated it.

2570
01:55:47.16 --> 01:55:49.16
And he turned it on for the first time.

2571
01:55:49.16 --> 01:55:52.16
You know how long took to clean that thing?

2572
01:55:52.16 --> 01:55:55.16
40 man hours to clean it.

2573
01:55:55.16 --> 01:55:57.16
Like it just, they need to cleaning.

2574
01:55:57.16 --> 01:56:00.16
Before we did anything cleaning, then we had to buy it all the parts.

2575
01:56:00.16 --> 01:56:01.16
Or have a machine.

2576
01:56:01.16 --> 01:56:03.16
And just to get it going in.

2577
01:56:03.16 --> 01:56:05.16
He turned it off for the first time.

2578
01:56:05.16 --> 01:56:08.16
And it was like, boom.

2579
01:56:08.16 --> 01:56:17.16
And I looked at John, my employee John Lenny and I said, oh,

2580
01:56:17.16 --> 01:56:19.16
oh, he sh**t.

2581
01:56:19.16 --> 01:56:23.16
And then, and there it comes.

2582
01:56:23.16 --> 01:56:26.16
And there's the Pearl weave coming off the loom.

2583
01:56:26.16 --> 01:56:28.16
Man, it was so exciting.

2584
01:56:28.16 --> 01:56:31.16
I was like, nobody's ever done this.

2585
01:56:31.16 --> 01:56:33.16
Nobody's ever done this.

2586
01:56:33.16 --> 01:56:36.16
And it was, I was super proud.

2587
01:56:36.16 --> 01:56:39.16
I was like, we're, we're freaking doing it.

2588
01:56:39.16 --> 01:56:41.16
We are doing it.

2589
01:56:41.16 --> 01:56:43.16
And then we announced it to the world.

2590
01:56:43.16 --> 01:56:47.16
We thought we still got a lot of work to do.

2591
01:56:47.16 --> 01:56:54.16
But now we announce it to the Jiu Jitsu world.

2592
01:56:54.16 --> 01:56:55.16
Sit, man.

2593
01:56:55.16 --> 01:56:58.16
How do you even want to tell you the challenges after weaving?

2594
01:56:58.16 --> 01:56:59.16
How do you color this stuff?

2595
01:56:59.16 --> 01:57:00.16
How do you do this?

2596
01:57:00.16 --> 01:57:01.16
How many of this?

2597
01:57:01.16 --> 01:57:04.16
I was telling you before when I was in this single team

2598
01:57:04.16 --> 01:57:06.16
in the early 90s.

2599
01:57:06.16 --> 01:57:09.16
We didn't have the custom gear, right?

2600
01:57:09.16 --> 01:57:13.16
You couldn't buy this stuff on the internet from these tactical companies, right?

2601
01:57:13.16 --> 01:57:14.16
So we made stuff.

2602
01:57:14.16 --> 01:57:19.16
And we had parachute rigors, which are the people that pack parachutes.

2603
01:57:19.16 --> 01:57:22.16
But in a parachute loft, you've got a nice medium duty.

2604
01:57:22.16 --> 01:57:24.16
And sometimes a heavy duty, so we machine.

2605
01:57:24.16 --> 01:57:26.16
And so we would make our own gear.

2606
01:57:26.16 --> 01:57:29.16
And us guys, like, we would kind of get into it a little bit.

2607
01:57:29.16 --> 01:57:32.16
And I, you know, I had us a lot of seals.

2608
01:57:32.16 --> 01:57:35.16
Would have their own, you know, sewing machines.

2609
01:57:35.16 --> 01:57:37.16
And, you know, you make gear.

2610
01:57:37.16 --> 01:57:39.16
And some people would be good at it.

2611
01:57:39.16 --> 01:57:40.16
Some people would get really good at it.

2612
01:57:40.16 --> 01:57:42.16
And I was not one of those people.

2613
01:57:42.16 --> 01:57:45.16
And because, you know, there's these little threads.

2614
01:57:45.16 --> 01:57:47.16
And you've got to get these things working right.

2615
01:57:47.16 --> 01:57:49.16
You pull it through the fable and through the fable and through the fable.

2616
01:57:49.16 --> 01:57:50.16
So obviously stuff.

2617
01:57:50.16 --> 01:57:51.16
It's all this stuff.

2618
01:57:51.16 --> 01:57:52.16
Yeah.

2619
01:57:52.16 --> 01:57:54.16
And so, and every time I like start sewing,

2620
01:57:54.16 --> 01:57:56.16
it would just, you know, fall apart.

2621
01:57:56.16 --> 01:57:59.16
Like birds nest and just mayhem.

2622
01:57:59.16 --> 01:58:02.16
And when I see, like, the loom.

2623
01:58:02.16 --> 01:58:03.16
Yeah.

2624
01:58:03.16 --> 01:58:05.16
With, it looks like stress you out.

2625
01:58:05.16 --> 01:58:09.16
One billion twins coming through these little things.

2626
01:58:09.16 --> 01:58:11.16
And, and they're flowing through.

2627
01:58:11.16 --> 01:58:14.16
And then you look on the other side and all that craziness.

2628
01:58:14.16 --> 01:58:17.16
There's like these hundreds of thousands.

2629
01:58:17.16 --> 01:58:20.16
It looks like little pins that are moving and things that are pulling apart.

2630
01:58:20.16 --> 01:58:21.16
And crazy.

2631
01:58:21.16 --> 01:58:23.16
And then it comes out the other side and you see this pattern.

2632
01:58:23.16 --> 01:58:24.16
Yeah.

2633
01:58:24.16 --> 01:58:26.16
And it, it, it makes me, it actually does stress.

2634
01:58:26.16 --> 01:58:27.16
Yeah.

2635
01:58:27.16 --> 01:58:30.16
I mean, I can't be in here for too long because I'm freaking out.

2636
01:58:30.16 --> 01:58:33.16
Just thinking, if I get too close to these things.

2637
01:58:33.16 --> 01:58:33.16
Oh yeah.

2638
01:58:33.16 --> 01:58:37.16
My, my presence will cause disturbances in the fable.

2639
01:58:37.16 --> 01:58:37.16
Yeah.

2640
01:58:37.16 --> 01:58:38.16
And things will be wrong.

2641
01:58:38.16 --> 01:58:39.16
Yeah.

2642
01:58:39.16 --> 01:58:42.16
I'm not allowed to be in there for very long because I'm like,

2643
01:58:42.16 --> 01:58:45.16
I'm, I've got, I've got an issue, you know,

2644
01:58:45.16 --> 01:58:48.16
a subliminal issue with threads.

2645
01:58:48.16 --> 01:58:52.16
And so I keep, even today, I have to keep in a little distance from the machines.

2646
01:58:52.16 --> 01:58:53.16
Yeah.

2647
01:58:53.16 --> 01:58:54.16
I don't want to found them up.

2648
01:58:54.16 --> 01:58:55.16
You guys have the magic.

2649
01:58:55.16 --> 01:58:56.16
Yeah.

2650
01:58:56.16 --> 01:58:57.16
I'm like, stay away from that.

2651
01:58:57.16 --> 01:58:58.16
But you had to see that.

2652
01:58:58.16 --> 01:59:02.16
And to even imagine it, like, you know, again, as a novice person,

2653
01:59:02.16 --> 01:59:07.16
working with a sewing machine as a young kid, the, how hard it was for me to do it.

2654
01:59:07.16 --> 01:59:09.16
And then, like I was watching Jill, the other way, I'm,

2655
01:59:09.16 --> 01:59:11.16
I'm, I'm just hammering.

2656
01:59:11.16 --> 01:59:15.16
You're just, it's like, such a good craft, such a good skill to have.

2657
01:59:15.16 --> 01:59:18.16
And, and just to see the loom and all those different parts,

2658
01:59:18.16 --> 01:59:21.16
you're saying yourself, well, for one thing,

2659
01:59:21.16 --> 01:59:24.16
but good luck, like somebody wants to do what we're doing.

2660
01:59:24.16 --> 01:59:25.16
Oh, go.

2661
01:59:25.16 --> 01:59:26.16
Yeah.

2662
01:59:26.16 --> 01:59:27.16
Do it.

2663
01:59:27.16 --> 01:59:27.16
Yeah.

2664
01:59:27.16 --> 01:59:28.16
Have fun with that one.

2665
01:59:28.16 --> 01:59:29.16
Not happening.

2666
01:59:29.16 --> 01:59:30.16
Not happening.

2667
01:59:30.16 --> 01:59:31.16
By the way, we bought the last loom.

2668
01:59:31.16 --> 01:59:32.16
It's in your ass.

2669
01:59:32.16 --> 01:59:33.16
Yeah.

2670
01:59:33.16 --> 01:59:34.16
It's your screw.

2671
01:59:34.16 --> 01:59:36.16
If you had your screw, yeah, absolutely.

2672
01:59:36.16 --> 01:59:40.16
And, and the last bit of knowledge would succeed, which exists.

2673
01:59:40.16 --> 01:59:41.16
Yeah.

2674
01:59:41.16 --> 01:59:42.16
Man.

2675
01:59:42.16 --> 01:59:45.16
And so then, you know, you, you take and you start weaving it.

2676
01:59:45.16 --> 01:59:48.16
And now you start to sell geese and how the business going now.

2677
01:59:48.16 --> 01:59:52.16
Now you're able to put on something, made in the USA.

2678
01:59:52.16 --> 01:59:53.16
100%.

2679
01:59:53.16 --> 01:59:56.16
And that's from the dirt to the shirt.

2680
01:59:56.16 --> 01:59:57.16
Yeah.

2681
01:59:57.16 --> 01:59:58.16
Can we rock it?

2682
01:59:58.16 --> 01:59:59.16
Yeah.

2683
01:59:59.16 --> 02:00:00.16
I'm ready.

2684
02:00:00.16 --> 02:00:01.16
Dirt to shirt, right?

2685
02:00:01.16 --> 02:00:06.16
I mean, because the finish, because the cotton is coming from Tennessee, Delta region,

2686
02:00:06.16 --> 02:00:10.16
Tennessee, spun in the Carolinas and shipped up to us.

2687
02:00:10.16 --> 02:00:12.16
That's like the, that's old school.

2688
02:00:12.16 --> 02:00:13.16
Freaking right?

2689
02:00:13.16 --> 02:00:14.16
It is the way.

2690
02:00:14.16 --> 02:00:15.16
It's the way.

2691
02:00:15.16 --> 02:00:16.16
It's the work.

2692
02:00:16.16 --> 02:00:17.16
That's old school.

2693
02:00:17.16 --> 02:00:18.16
Making shit, you know?

2694
02:00:18.16 --> 02:00:22.16
I mean, I talked today a little bit at our grand old school.

2695
02:00:22.16 --> 02:00:24.16
But at our grand opening about like,

2696
02:00:24.16 --> 02:00:25.16
Manors.

2697
02:00:25.16 --> 02:00:35.16
Generations of folks that put their hands on something, right?

2698
02:00:35.16 --> 02:00:37.16
They're makers.

2699
02:00:37.16 --> 02:00:39.16
They need to make something.

2700
02:00:39.16 --> 02:00:43.16
And they're trying to cross train these people to.

2701
02:00:43.16 --> 02:00:49.16
Type on a computer, you know, do mundane office type of tasks, filing papers,

2702
02:00:49.16 --> 02:00:54.16
answering the phone and call centers.

2703
02:00:54.16 --> 02:00:56.16
These people want to make shit.

2704
02:00:56.16 --> 02:01:02.16
We're known in Maine for being some of the best crafts people in the world.

2705
02:01:02.16 --> 02:01:08.16
The products that come from Maine are some of the best products in the world.

2706
02:01:08.16 --> 02:01:14.16
And to be part of resurrecting that heritage is, it's incredible.

2707
02:01:14.16 --> 02:01:17.16
You know, and it is our ultimate mission.

2708
02:01:17.16 --> 02:01:32.16
You know, to resurrect our heritage and manufacturing and build old world level quality products and stand behind it.

2709
02:01:32.16 --> 02:01:35.16
Stitch.

2710
02:01:35.16 --> 02:01:37.16
Every stitch.

2711
02:01:37.16 --> 02:01:40.16
Every yarn in the weave.

2712
02:01:40.16 --> 02:01:42.16
And that's what we're all about.

2713
02:01:42.16 --> 02:01:44.16
And that's what origin stands for.

2714
02:01:44.16 --> 02:01:49.16
We're the little bit more modern look and feel.

2715
02:01:49.16 --> 02:01:55.16
But sourcing and manufacturing 100% in the US.

2716
02:01:55.16 --> 02:01:59.16
And I, I, we won't compromise on that.

2717
02:01:59.16 --> 02:02:00.16
At ever.

2718
02:02:00.16 --> 02:02:04.16
Like other companies do when they get greedy.

2719
02:02:04.16 --> 02:02:08.16
And they say, well, it's time to look at the numbers.

2720
02:02:08.16 --> 02:02:13.16
It's time to increase the margins and we got to import some of the stuff.

2721
02:02:13.16 --> 02:02:16.16
And we're not just not doing it.

2722
02:02:16.16 --> 02:02:19.16
It's not happening.

2723
02:02:19.16 --> 02:02:26.16
I was in that background works for the awesome, the Christening of the USM Michael Montsour.

2724
02:02:26.16 --> 02:02:29.16
Obviously named after Michael Montsour.

2725
02:02:29.16 --> 02:02:32.16
And it was awesome for me.

2726
02:02:32.16 --> 02:02:37.16
You know, I, I, I, in listen to the Navy from down in Portland.

2727
02:02:37.16 --> 02:02:42.16
And to come back 20, six years later.

2728
02:02:42.16 --> 02:02:45.16
And see what you're talking about.

2729
02:02:45.16 --> 02:02:49.16
What, what I knew existed in New England in Maine.

2730
02:02:49.16 --> 02:02:55.16
And, and see in the pride that these, you know, ship builders,

2731
02:02:55.16 --> 02:03:02.16
the iron workers that the pride that they took in that ship named after a,

2732
02:03:02.16 --> 02:03:05.16
a, a saint of a human being.

2733
02:03:05.16 --> 02:03:10.16
And, you know, that's one of the things that I tied to.

2734
02:03:10.16 --> 02:03:13.16
And I was like, you know, you know, you're going to get to the origin.

2735
02:03:13.16 --> 02:03:16.16
Because I knew what you were doing up here.

2736
02:03:16.16 --> 02:03:17.16
Yeah.

2737
02:03:17.16 --> 02:03:21.16
And, you know, to kind of get to how we ended up joining forces.

2738
02:03:21.16 --> 02:03:26.16
It's funny because, you know, you were just some guy, you know,

2739
02:03:26.16 --> 02:03:31.16
some crazy guy up in Maine in my opinion, that I'd, well, I'd seen a couple of your videos.

2740
02:03:31.16 --> 02:03:32.16
And I've seen it.

2741
02:03:32.16 --> 02:03:37.16
I see a dude, you know, you have the video that shows you pulling this freaking loom out of this factory.

2742
02:03:37.16 --> 02:03:40.16
And I'm just thinking of myself, this guy is insane.

2743
02:03:40.16 --> 02:03:42.16
And I think I like him.

2744
02:03:42.16 --> 02:03:46.16
And, and, and I had actually, the funny thing is for my Jim and San Diego,

2745
02:03:46.16 --> 02:03:50.16
Victory MMA, I wanted to make Jiu-Jitsu Giz in America.

2746
02:03:50.16 --> 02:03:52.16
And so I was like, okay, this, I looked around.

2747
02:03:52.16 --> 02:03:54.16
I find one guy that's doing it.

2748
02:03:54.16 --> 02:03:55.16
It's you.

2749
02:03:55.16 --> 02:03:59.16
We, like, three or four years ago, we went back and forth on email.

2750
02:03:59.16 --> 02:04:01.16
And, you know, nothing ever came of it.

2751
02:04:01.16 --> 02:04:02.16
Because, you know, I was busy.

2752
02:04:02.16 --> 02:04:04.16
You were busy and just nothing happened.

2753
02:04:04.16 --> 02:04:06.16
But I always just remember, hey, you know what?

2754
02:04:06.16 --> 02:04:10.16
This guy up in Maine, he's, he's, he's doing what he's doing.

2755
02:04:10.16 --> 02:04:11.16
It the right way.

2756
02:04:11.16 --> 02:04:19.16
And what happened was the way we actually got connected was I was on a face book live.

2757
02:04:19.16 --> 02:04:21.16
Just talking to people.

2758
02:04:21.16 --> 02:04:24.16
And someone says, what kind of geesh did I get?

2759
02:04:24.16 --> 02:04:26.16
And I just rattled off.

2760
02:04:26.16 --> 02:04:30.16
I go, hey, man, if you're gonna, if you need a geet, you're starting to jitsu or you're good at jitsu or you just want a good geet.

2761
02:04:30.16 --> 02:04:33.16
I go, get a geet from origin.

2762
02:04:33.16 --> 02:04:34.16
Origin main.com.

2763
02:04:34.16 --> 02:04:36.16
I go, get a geet from there. I go, this crazy guy up there.

2764
02:04:36.16 --> 02:04:38.16
He fixed a looove.

2765
02:04:38.16 --> 02:04:39.16
I can't say it without laughing.

2766
02:04:39.16 --> 02:04:40.16
He's so crazy.

2767
02:04:40.16 --> 02:04:48.16
I'm like, he took a loom out of a broken factory and he re-verbored that thing with his team and they built, you know, they're doing it.

2768
02:04:48.16 --> 02:04:49.16
They're building it.

2769
02:04:49.16 --> 02:04:57.16
So if you need a geet, I said, I'm trying to talk to this guy because I had reached out to you a couple times if two very even since the time I asked for four gees.

2770
02:04:57.16 --> 02:04:58.16
Right.

2771
02:04:58.16 --> 02:05:00.16
I'd said, since you need mail or something.

2772
02:05:00.16 --> 02:05:02.16
And I said, you know, I'm trying to talk to anybody knows this guy.

2773
02:05:02.16 --> 02:05:05.16
His name is Pete. I go, tell him I said, what's up.

2774
02:05:05.16 --> 02:05:10.16
And this, this awesome woman that listens to podcasts.

2775
02:05:10.16 --> 02:05:17.16
Her name is Sarah Armstrong and she's super square away, you know, a professional with a big company.

2776
02:05:17.16 --> 02:05:25.16
And she, you know, she did communicate with a various things over the over the past year that I've been doing the podcast and whatnot.

2777
02:05:25.16 --> 02:05:29.16
And for, she said, oh, I'll take that for action.

2778
02:05:29.16 --> 02:05:30.16
And she contacted me.

2779
02:05:30.16 --> 02:05:32.16
She contacted me.

2780
02:05:32.16 --> 02:05:33.16
She called me.

2781
02:05:33.16 --> 02:05:36.16
She said, what would she say?

2782
02:05:36.16 --> 02:05:42.16
She just said, you basically she's like, have you heard of this guy,

2783
02:05:42.16 --> 02:05:44.16
Jock Willink and do them sorry.

2784
02:05:44.16 --> 02:05:47.16
I had my head up my ass for the last five years trying to build this factory.

2785
02:05:47.16 --> 02:05:48.16
No factor.

2786
02:05:48.16 --> 02:05:49.16
And I was like, you're like, who?

2787
02:05:49.16 --> 02:05:50.16
No.

2788
02:05:50.16 --> 02:05:52.16
And then so, you know, what do I do?

2789
02:05:52.16 --> 02:05:55.16
I dig and like, holy shit.

2790
02:05:55.16 --> 02:05:58.16
Like this guy is making some waves.

2791
02:05:58.16 --> 02:06:00.16
This is awesome.

2792
02:06:00.16 --> 02:06:04.16
And so I did a little recon.

2793
02:06:04.16 --> 02:06:08.16
And then I reached out to after that.

2794
02:06:08.16 --> 02:06:13.16
And what's awesome is like, I had no idea what we were going to do.

2795
02:06:13.16 --> 02:06:14.16
Yeah.

2796
02:06:14.16 --> 02:06:20.16
You know, we went back and forth a couple times an email and then find me, you're like, hey, man, let's, let's just go to Skype.

2797
02:06:20.16 --> 02:06:21.16
Right.

2798
02:06:21.16 --> 02:06:22.16
Let's do Skype.

2799
02:06:22.16 --> 02:06:24.16
Because we'd been, I today, you know, do you want to do something?

2800
02:06:24.16 --> 02:06:25.16
You're like, I want to do something.

2801
02:06:25.16 --> 02:06:29.16
Like, no, let's figure it out.

2802
02:06:29.16 --> 02:06:33.16
So I have my meetings like scheduled and I'm working all day.

2803
02:06:33.16 --> 02:06:34.16
Sure.

2804
02:06:34.16 --> 02:06:37.16
And I blocked two hours.

2805
02:06:37.16 --> 02:06:40.16
I'm like, you know what, this is probably going to take a while to get this conversation going.

2806
02:06:40.16 --> 02:06:41.16
I'm about two hours.

2807
02:06:41.16 --> 02:06:43.16
We're just going to get on Skype and make this happen.

2808
02:06:43.16 --> 02:06:45.16
We'll figure out what we can do.

2809
02:06:45.16 --> 02:06:49.16
So we end up talking on Skype for four hours.

2810
02:06:49.16 --> 02:06:54.16
Talking, laughing, talking, laughing, yelling, laughing, laughing, laughing.

2811
02:06:54.16 --> 02:06:59.16
After I got off my wife goes, it sounded like you were talking to you.

2812
02:06:59.16 --> 02:07:01.16
That's not good.

2813
02:07:01.16 --> 02:07:03.16
It's just a little scared.

2814
02:07:03.16 --> 02:07:08.16
And it was just, you know, it was awesome.

2815
02:07:08.16 --> 02:07:16.16
For me, it was, you know, the things that I believe in as an American as a person, as a New Englander,

2816
02:07:16.16 --> 02:07:21.16
it was like you had the thing that I didn't have.

2817
02:07:21.16 --> 02:07:22.16
Right?

2818
02:07:22.16 --> 02:07:28.16
Like, you know, for instance, we're making things, we're building things, but we don't have vertical integration.

2819
02:07:28.16 --> 02:07:32.16
We don't, we don't, we weren't doing it the way I want to get it done.

2820
02:07:32.16 --> 02:07:34.16
And so, you know what I'm saying?

2821
02:07:34.16 --> 02:07:36.16
Hey, like, let's join forces.

2822
02:07:36.16 --> 02:07:37.16
Yeah, absolutely.

2823
02:07:37.16 --> 02:07:43.16
And from my perspective, of course, I was like, the student is for real.

2824
02:07:43.16 --> 02:07:47.16
I was like, I don't want to tell my wife, I'm like, man, it's guy.

2825
02:07:47.16 --> 02:07:49.16
He's on another level.

2826
02:07:49.16 --> 02:07:52.16
And we had been like looking for somebody.

2827
02:07:52.16 --> 02:07:59.16
I remember talking with the deco and it's like, in GG2, it's like, you've got all these world champs.

2828
02:07:59.16 --> 02:08:04.16
And then you have like the flavor of the month guys with like the fancy GG2 stuff.

2829
02:08:04.16 --> 02:08:11.16
And we just, it just never part of our plan to sponsor GG2 world champions, right?

2830
02:08:11.16 --> 02:08:14.16
Because what we were trying to build is like much bigger than that.

2831
02:08:14.16 --> 02:08:17.16
It's like, man, we've been talking for like a year.

2832
02:08:17.16 --> 02:08:27.16
Like we need to, we need to find somebody or partner somebody with somebody that like represents origin through and through.

2833
02:08:27.16 --> 02:08:31.16
In multiple ways, this isn't possible.

2834
02:08:31.16 --> 02:08:33.16
We will not find this person.

2835
02:08:33.16 --> 02:08:36.16
It's not possible.

2836
02:08:36.16 --> 02:08:38.16
And then we talk.

2837
02:08:38.16 --> 02:08:41.16
You know, we were talking earlier today.

2838
02:08:41.16 --> 02:08:44.16
This was, this was classic because I didn't remember this.

2839
02:08:44.16 --> 02:08:52.16
So for those of you that know anything about negotiation, whether you're negotiating car purchase or whatever.

2840
02:08:52.16 --> 02:08:58.16
One of the things, one of the tactics of negotiation is you don't give a number first.

2841
02:08:58.16 --> 02:09:04.16
So if I want, if echo wants to buy these sunglasses, he, he says, how much of these.

2842
02:09:04.16 --> 02:09:08.16
I don't say they're 10 bucks because what if he was willing to pay 20, right?

2843
02:09:08.16 --> 02:09:12.16
So so, you know, if he says, how much of these, I go, well, you know, what are you willing to pay for?

2844
02:09:12.16 --> 02:09:14.16
And he should say, well, you know, I don't know, what are they worth to you?

2845
02:09:14.16 --> 02:09:17.16
And so Pete and I had the textbook.

2846
02:09:17.16 --> 02:09:20.16
It was more than that though because it was, it was the strategies.

2847
02:09:20.16 --> 02:09:22.16
It's like, what do you got to do?

2848
02:09:22.16 --> 02:09:25.16
You've got to devalue or show value.

2849
02:09:25.16 --> 02:09:26.16
Yeah.

2850
02:09:26.16 --> 02:09:27.16
So going back and forth.

2851
02:09:27.16 --> 02:09:28.16
Well, yeah.

2852
02:09:28.16 --> 02:09:29.16
Well, yeah.

2853
02:09:29.16 --> 02:09:34.16
Yeah, but, you know, it's like, you know, back and forth battle, battle, battle.

2854
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:34.16
Yeah.

2855
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:35.16
And then I came.

2856
02:09:35.16 --> 02:09:39.16
And it's, so I were trying to figure out the value of whatever of something.

2857
02:09:39.16 --> 02:09:43.16
And, and I'm like, well, you know, like, I don't just give, I mean, what if you had to,

2858
02:09:43.16 --> 02:09:47.16
what would you say, number of people that and he's, you know, he's gives me X.

2859
02:09:47.16 --> 02:09:49.16
And I didn't remember doing this pretty till we did that.

2860
02:09:49.16 --> 02:09:53.16
And then I remember, as you said, you know, the value's probably X.

2861
02:09:53.16 --> 02:09:55.16
And I went, you're weak.

2862
02:09:55.16 --> 02:09:56.16
He's broken.

2863
02:09:56.16 --> 02:09:58.16
We both started laughing this together.

2864
02:09:58.16 --> 02:10:00.16
Because we've been playing the game for so long.

2865
02:10:00.16 --> 02:10:04.16
It was like, actually, that is what, like both,

2866
02:10:04.16 --> 02:10:08.16
I think both of us realized, like, we were just, let's just get it.

2867
02:10:08.16 --> 02:10:09.16
Let's do this.

2868
02:10:09.16 --> 02:10:10.16
Yeah.

2869
02:10:10.16 --> 02:10:12.16
But actually, you know, I'm busy, you're busy.

2870
02:10:12.16 --> 02:10:13.16
Yeah.

2871
02:10:13.16 --> 02:10:18.16
And so we, and we actually, we both definitely got along.

2872
02:10:18.16 --> 02:10:19.16
Yeah.

2873
02:10:19.16 --> 02:10:23.16
We, I mean, I think both of us felt really solid about the other person.

2874
02:10:23.16 --> 02:10:27.16
But we didn't quite figure out how to, we couldn't figure out how to make this work.

2875
02:10:27.16 --> 02:10:28.16
Yeah.

2876
02:10:28.16 --> 02:10:29.16
Right.

2877
02:10:29.16 --> 02:10:34.16
You know, he's got something that he's put years of blood, sweat, tears into.

2878
02:10:34.16 --> 02:10:38.16
I've got something that I've been doing my life has been to get to here.

2879
02:10:38.16 --> 02:10:41.16
And so we just couldn't quite figure out how this is going to work.

2880
02:10:41.16 --> 02:10:43.16
So we just, you know, we kept in touch.

2881
02:10:43.16 --> 02:10:47.16
A little bit of conversation over the next, you know, couple months.

2882
02:10:47.16 --> 02:10:50.16
And then I knew I was going to Maine.

2883
02:10:50.16 --> 02:10:52.16
You, you, you, you, you kept.

2884
02:10:52.16 --> 02:10:53.16
I got to ask you something now.

2885
02:10:53.16 --> 02:10:56.16
You know, you, you, you're coming to Maine.

2886
02:10:56.16 --> 02:10:58.16
I knew you were coming to Maine.

2887
02:10:58.16 --> 02:11:01.16
Neither of us, like, we didn't text back and forth until the last minute.

2888
02:11:01.16 --> 02:11:04.16
Because I knew the date you were coming to Maine.

2889
02:11:04.16 --> 02:11:05.16
Uh huh.

2890
02:11:05.16 --> 02:11:12.16
Did you, were you planning on a meeting when you came to Maine the whole time?

2891
02:11:12.16 --> 02:11:14.16
I definitely knew we needed to meet.

2892
02:11:14.16 --> 02:11:15.16
Yeah.

2893
02:11:15.16 --> 02:11:16.16
Yeah.

2894
02:11:16.16 --> 02:11:19.16
He's like, you were icing me.

2895
02:11:19.16 --> 02:11:21.16
You put me on the ice, dude.

2896
02:11:21.16 --> 02:11:24.16
I thought I was putting you on ice.

2897
02:11:24.16 --> 02:11:27.16
We were both on ice.

2898
02:11:27.16 --> 02:11:28.16
Yeah.

2899
02:11:28.16 --> 02:11:31.16
So that was an, that was like the meeting.

2900
02:11:31.16 --> 02:11:32.16
Awesome.

2901
02:11:32.16 --> 02:11:34.16
We met up in Portland.

2902
02:11:34.16 --> 02:11:35.16
Uh, we had dinner.

2903
02:11:35.16 --> 02:11:37.16
We actually both brought our wives.

2904
02:11:37.16 --> 02:11:41.16
And I, my wife is always too busy to do anything business-wise with her.

2905
02:11:41.16 --> 02:11:45.16
So she was super stoked to even be around and meet Amanda and everything.

2906
02:11:45.16 --> 02:11:47.16
And, you know, you, we sat there.

2907
02:11:47.16 --> 02:11:50.16
Our wives don't even know what they were doing because I would just end it up.

2908
02:11:50.16 --> 02:11:52.16
We were getting so cold.

2909
02:11:52.16 --> 02:11:56.16
And, and at the end of the night, we figured out.

2910
02:11:56.16 --> 02:11:59.16
And we were doing this.

2911
02:11:59.16 --> 02:12:00.16
And we shook hands.

2912
02:12:00.16 --> 02:12:01.16
And, and I knew right there.

2913
02:12:01.16 --> 02:12:02.16
We were good.

2914
02:12:02.16 --> 02:12:04.16
We, we, we crafted the deal that was awesome.

2915
02:12:04.16 --> 02:12:05.16
Yep.

2916
02:12:05.16 --> 02:12:06.16
It was awesome for both of us.

2917
02:12:06.16 --> 02:12:08.16
It was awesome for everything that both of us won.

2918
02:12:08.16 --> 02:12:09.16
Which Eve.

2919
02:12:09.16 --> 02:12:12.16
And it, it, it, it turned into not even both of us.

2920
02:12:12.16 --> 02:12:13.16
It's just turned into us.

2921
02:12:13.16 --> 02:12:14.16
Exactly.

2922
02:12:14.16 --> 02:12:15.16
And that was awesome.

2923
02:12:15.16 --> 02:12:18.16
And I think one of the best like lessons.

2924
02:12:18.16 --> 02:12:21.16
Learn from.

2925
02:12:21.16 --> 02:12:23.16
From you, what is.

2926
02:12:23.16 --> 02:12:25.16
Just an incredible opportunity.

2927
02:12:25.16 --> 02:12:33.16
The deal is making sure that you're both getting what you want and you're both a little bit uncomfortable.

2928
02:12:33.16 --> 02:12:38.16
So that you continue to.

2929
02:12:38.16 --> 02:12:44.16
Feel a little bit of the struggle to make sure you can take it over the goal line.

2930
02:12:44.16 --> 02:12:45.16
Right.

2931
02:12:45.16 --> 02:12:46.16
You're too comfortable.

2932
02:12:46.16 --> 02:12:48.16
You become complacent.

2933
02:12:48.16 --> 02:12:51.16
Bite off a little more than you can chew.

2934
02:12:51.16 --> 02:12:53.16
And you're going to be chewing for much longer.

2935
02:12:53.16 --> 02:12:56.16
So that's, that's something that was important.

2936
02:12:56.16 --> 02:12:57.16
It was awesome.

2937
02:12:57.16 --> 02:12:58.16
Yeah.

2938
02:12:58.16 --> 02:12:59.16
And so just so everyone knows.

2939
02:12:59.16 --> 02:13:02.16
I mean, I've been saying it like, we're partners.

2940
02:13:02.16 --> 02:13:09.16
You know, we're partners with, with the podcast and what, what echo and I've been doing for the last a couple years.

2941
02:13:09.16 --> 02:13:18.16
And what, what has been, has been doing for the last five years, seven years, five, five years, five, five years, five, five, six years, six years.

2942
02:13:18.16 --> 02:13:31.16
And, and at the end of the night when we got done eating our stakes in Portland, Maine, we show cans and this whole, you know, you've described it as like a perfect storm, which is what it feels like to me.

2943
02:13:31.16 --> 02:13:33.16
It is a house-borne and glossy.

2944
02:13:33.16 --> 02:13:34.16
There you go.

2945
02:13:34.16 --> 02:13:35.16
It is the perfect storm.

2946
02:13:35.16 --> 02:13:37.16
We are the perfect storm.

2947
02:13:37.16 --> 02:13:38.16
Yeah.

2948
02:13:38.16 --> 02:13:44.16
And so that's what's going on is that, you know, now we've got this.

2949
02:13:44.16 --> 02:13:57.16
And we join forces and that we, we both complement each other's, you know, in terms of our business, we complement each other's weaknesses, in terms of our personalities, we complement each other's weaknesses.

2950
02:13:57.16 --> 02:14:02.16
And we're, and the best part about it is the whole time that we're doing it.

2951
02:14:02.16 --> 02:14:05.16
We're actually laughing our asses off at each other.

2952
02:14:05.16 --> 02:14:08.16
It's a great time, which is, which is what it's all about.

2953
02:14:08.16 --> 02:14:10.16
So that's what we're hot.

2954
02:14:10.16 --> 02:14:11.16
That's why we're here.

2955
02:14:11.16 --> 02:14:12.16
By the way.

2956
02:14:12.16 --> 02:14:12.16
Yeah.

2957
02:14:12.16 --> 02:14:13.16
That's why we're here.

2958
02:14:13.16 --> 02:14:19.16
By the way, it farming to me in the origin factory 20,000 square feet.

2959
02:14:19.16 --> 02:14:22.16
We're going to end up with how many employees in here.

2960
02:14:22.16 --> 02:14:24.16
In a year, how many employees we're going to have in here?

2961
02:14:24.16 --> 02:14:26.16
Oh, probably in a year.

2962
02:14:26.16 --> 02:14:27.16
I don't know, 30, 40, 50.

2963
02:14:27.16 --> 02:14:30.16
I mean, somewhere in there, you know, between 30 and 50.

2964
02:14:30.16 --> 02:14:31.16
That's in a year.

2965
02:14:31.16 --> 02:14:34.16
But remember, this is a start.

2966
02:14:34.16 --> 02:14:37.16
We're starting.

2967
02:14:37.16 --> 02:14:40.16
And so in five years, we're going to have a lot of people.

2968
02:14:40.16 --> 02:14:44.16
Oh, yeah, we're in people ask, what are you going to make?

2969
02:14:44.16 --> 02:14:45.16
Everything.

2970
02:14:45.16 --> 02:14:48.16
And I say, we're going to make everything.

2971
02:14:48.16 --> 02:14:57.16
Everything that I use in my life, I want it made here in America from the shorts to the hats.

2972
02:14:57.16 --> 02:14:58.16
Everything.

2973
02:14:58.16 --> 02:15:01.16
And that's what we're going to do.

2974
02:15:01.16 --> 02:15:03.16
Beenies.

2975
02:15:03.16 --> 02:15:06.16
Uh, probably pants, bigger pants.

2976
02:15:06.16 --> 02:15:07.16
You know what?

2977
02:15:07.16 --> 02:15:09.16
How is that a store the other day?

2978
02:15:09.16 --> 02:15:14.16
Uh, you know, like a hardware store, but a big one, where they sell work clothes.

2979
02:15:14.16 --> 02:15:19.16
And I said to myself, you know, let's just, because obviously I'm thinking about this all the time now.

2980
02:15:19.16 --> 02:15:21.16
You know, it's hard to look at work clothes.

2981
02:15:21.16 --> 02:15:26.16
And you say, of course, American workers, they would want to wear American made clothes.

2982
02:15:26.16 --> 02:15:28.16
Where are these clothes made?

2983
02:15:28.16 --> 02:15:29.16
They're not made here.

2984
02:15:29.16 --> 02:15:30.16
They're not made in America.

2985
02:15:30.16 --> 02:15:32.16
They're not made by American hands.

2986
02:15:32.16 --> 02:15:36.16
So I think we're going to be going to take no prisoner scenario.

2987
02:15:36.16 --> 02:15:38.16
And we're going to do it after it.

2988
02:15:38.16 --> 02:15:41.16
Or not just kind of take no prisoner.

2989
02:15:41.16 --> 02:15:44.16
We're going to chase the big dogs.

2990
02:15:44.16 --> 02:15:46.16
Look out.

2991
02:15:46.16 --> 02:15:47.16
Look out.

2992
02:15:47.16 --> 02:15:49.16
Listen and look out.

2993
02:15:49.16 --> 02:15:52.16
And that's not, that's not like an ego thing.

2994
02:15:52.16 --> 02:15:53.16
That's a truth.

2995
02:15:53.16 --> 02:15:54.16
Yeah.

2996
02:15:54.16 --> 02:15:56.16
Listen and look out.

2997
02:15:56.16 --> 02:15:57.16
Yeah.

2998
02:15:57.16 --> 02:16:05.16
And like I said, today, when you, when you rekindle the fire of manufacturing and the, you rekindle,

2999
02:16:05.16 --> 02:16:09.16
I mean, just talking to talking to the employees here.

3000
02:16:09.16 --> 02:16:11.16
This is what they want to do.

3001
02:16:11.16 --> 02:16:14.16
100% and this is what they made to do.

3002
02:16:14.16 --> 02:16:15.16
That's right.

3003
02:16:15.16 --> 02:16:18.16
And like you said, they want to take these things and build them with their hands.

3004
02:16:18.16 --> 02:16:19.16
You've got it.

3005
02:16:19.16 --> 02:16:22.16
And that opportunity has been taken away in the last 25 years.

3006
02:16:22.16 --> 02:16:24.16
And we're bringing it back.

3007
02:16:24.16 --> 02:16:25.16
And that is awesome.

3008
02:16:25.16 --> 02:16:26.16
Appreciate that.

3009
02:16:26.16 --> 02:16:28.16
Glad to have you as part of it.

3010
02:16:28.16 --> 02:16:30.16
Awesome.

3011
02:16:30.16 --> 02:16:33.16
That's what we did echo Charles.

3012
02:16:33.16 --> 02:16:34.16
Right.

3013
02:16:34.16 --> 02:16:36.16
My brother.

3014
02:16:36.16 --> 02:16:39.16
Speaking of what we do.

3015
02:16:39.16 --> 02:16:40.16
Sure.

3016
02:16:40.16 --> 02:16:43.16
Why don't you do what you do?

3017
02:16:43.16 --> 02:16:44.16
I have a question.

3018
02:16:44.16 --> 02:16:46.16
After you ask a question.

3019
02:16:46.16 --> 02:16:49.16
Do you find it?

3020
02:16:49.16 --> 02:16:55.16
Poledic that the origin logo is that circle.

3021
02:16:55.16 --> 02:16:59.16
Remember when you're getting shit from the politicians.

3022
02:16:59.16 --> 02:17:00.16
That's funny.

3023
02:17:00.16 --> 02:17:01.16
You never thought about that.

3024
02:17:01.16 --> 02:17:05.16
And now you have an origin logo that's a circle.

3025
02:17:05.16 --> 02:17:06.16
It is.

3026
02:17:06.16 --> 02:17:09.16
So that kind of in and of itself is like a circle.

3027
02:17:09.16 --> 02:17:09.16
Yeah.

3028
02:17:09.16 --> 02:17:11.16
Actually, it is a wave.

3029
02:17:11.16 --> 02:17:13.16
It's actually like a rip curl wave.

3030
02:17:13.16 --> 02:17:14.16
Is that what that logo is?

3031
02:17:14.16 --> 02:17:17.16
It's the flow.

3032
02:17:17.16 --> 02:17:19.16
Did you do too flow?

3033
02:17:19.16 --> 02:17:20.16
The surf flow.

3034
02:17:20.16 --> 02:17:21.16
It's a wave.

3035
02:17:21.16 --> 02:17:22.16
It's what that is.

3036
02:17:22.16 --> 02:17:24.16
It's breaking symbolic.

3037
02:17:24.16 --> 02:17:25.16
It's what it's calling.

3038
02:17:25.16 --> 02:17:27.16
I was going to say ironic, but that's not ironic.

3039
02:17:27.16 --> 02:17:29.16
No symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic.

3040
02:17:29.16 --> 02:17:31.16
So yeah.

3041
02:17:31.16 --> 02:17:34.16
I don't even remember who that politician was.

3042
02:17:34.16 --> 02:17:35.16
Doesn't matter.

3043
02:17:35.16 --> 02:17:36.16
Nope.

3044
02:17:36.16 --> 02:17:37.16
They're going to know that origin symbol.

3045
02:17:37.16 --> 02:17:39.16
I'm going to try.

3046
02:17:39.16 --> 02:17:41.16
In the industry.

3047
02:17:41.16 --> 02:17:43.16
We call that layers.

3048
02:17:43.16 --> 02:17:44.16
True story.

3049
02:17:44.16 --> 02:17:45.16
Anyway, speaking of layers.

3050
02:17:45.16 --> 02:17:46.16
Got it.

3051
02:17:46.16 --> 02:17:48.16
And support, by the way.

3052
02:17:48.16 --> 02:17:50.16
Support the spotcast.

3053
02:17:50.16 --> 02:17:52.16
And yourself.

3054
02:17:52.16 --> 02:17:54.16
Originmain.com.

3055
02:17:54.16 --> 02:17:55.16
Speak of the devil.

3056
02:17:55.16 --> 02:17:56.16
Yeah.

3057
02:17:56.16 --> 02:17:57.16
That's how you could support.

3058
02:17:57.16 --> 02:17:58.16
Yeah.

3059
02:17:58.16 --> 02:17:59.16
That's all.

3060
02:17:59.16 --> 02:18:00.16
Good to know.

3061
02:18:00.16 --> 02:18:01.16
What do we got, geez.

3062
02:18:01.16 --> 02:18:02.16
So that's the thing.

3063
02:18:02.16 --> 02:18:05.16
From the beginning, people ask what's the key to get?

3064
02:18:05.16 --> 02:18:06.16
We know.

3065
02:18:06.16 --> 02:18:07.16
We know now.

3066
02:18:07.16 --> 02:18:08.16
100%.

3067
02:18:08.16 --> 02:18:09.16
100%.

3068
02:18:09.16 --> 02:18:10.16
100%.

3069
02:18:10.16 --> 02:18:12.16
You know, you have like a hierarchy.

3070
02:18:12.16 --> 02:18:13.16
Yeah.

3071
02:18:13.16 --> 02:18:14.16
We can only have one.

3072
02:18:14.16 --> 02:18:15.16
Yeah.

3073
02:18:15.16 --> 02:18:16.16
But you have multiple selections.

3074
02:18:16.16 --> 02:18:17.16
Yeah.

3075
02:18:17.16 --> 02:18:18.16
So they do.

3076
02:18:18.16 --> 02:18:19.16
Yeah.

3077
02:18:19.16 --> 02:18:20.16
Yeah.

3078
02:18:20.16 --> 02:18:23.16
We're about to like blow up our manufacturing.

3079
02:18:23.16 --> 02:18:24.16
And this new factory.

3080
02:18:24.16 --> 02:18:26.16
And grand opening today.

3081
02:18:26.16 --> 02:18:27.16
Lots of product coming.

3082
02:18:27.16 --> 02:18:28.16
Right.

3083
02:18:28.16 --> 02:18:29.16
On the geese side of stuff.

3084
02:18:29.16 --> 02:18:30.16
Yeah.

3085
02:18:30.16 --> 02:18:31.16
Ramping things up over the next.

3086
02:18:31.16 --> 02:18:32.16
What time frame?

3087
02:18:32.16 --> 02:18:37.16
We've started ramping over the next four to eight weeks.

3088
02:18:37.16 --> 02:18:43.16
Let's say we're going to be hiring another 16 people.

3089
02:18:43.16 --> 02:18:44.16
We put another loom in the factory.

3090
02:18:44.16 --> 02:18:46.16
So there's just three looms now.

3091
02:18:46.16 --> 02:18:49.16
And we're going to be weaving ninjas.

3092
02:18:49.16 --> 02:18:51.16
Like, like, for real.

3093
02:18:51.16 --> 02:18:55.16
Like, I mean, I didn't want to elaborate.

3094
02:18:55.16 --> 02:18:58.16
We just come come to Maine and see any time in the factory.

3095
02:18:58.16 --> 02:18:59.16
Come check it out.

3096
02:18:59.16 --> 02:19:00.16
I like it.

3097
02:19:00.16 --> 02:19:03.16
When are these shorts coming out that I'm wearing?

3098
02:19:03.16 --> 02:19:04.16
Oh, boy.

3099
02:19:04.16 --> 02:19:05.16
Because they're straight up my best shorts.

3100
02:19:05.16 --> 02:19:06.16
100%.

02:19:06.16 --> 02:19:07.16
Yeah.

3102
02:19:07.16 --> 02:19:08.16
Yeah.

3103
02:19:08.16 --> 02:19:10.16
We're going to make it happen.

3104
02:19:10.16 --> 02:19:11.16
Yeah.

3105
02:19:11.16 --> 02:19:13.16
It's a video.

3106
02:19:13.16 --> 02:19:14.16
I said, thanks.

3107
02:19:14.16 --> 02:19:15.16
Yeah.

3108
02:19:15.16 --> 02:19:15.16
Yeah.

3109
02:19:15.16 --> 02:19:16.16
No.

3110
02:19:16.16 --> 02:19:17.16
Well, hey, I get that all the time.

3111
02:19:17.16 --> 02:19:19.16
Hey, when is the XYC coming out?

3112
02:19:19.16 --> 02:19:20.16
Hey, so not talking you.

3113
02:19:20.16 --> 02:19:21.16
Little bit.

3114
02:19:21.16 --> 02:19:23.16
You know, but yeah, these are straight up the best shorts.

3115
02:19:23.16 --> 02:19:24.16
Well, it's not actually that hard for you.

3116
02:19:24.16 --> 02:19:25.16
Because people say, when is that next?

3117
02:19:25.16 --> 02:19:28.16
Oh, you're talking about the gear side.

3118
02:19:28.16 --> 02:19:29.16
The Mersh.

3119
02:19:29.16 --> 02:19:30.16
The Mersh.

3120
02:19:30.16 --> 02:19:31.16
The merchandise side.

3121
02:19:31.16 --> 02:19:36.16
And I do believe that it might be a little bit more work on pizza and compared to on my end.

3122
02:19:36.16 --> 02:19:37.16
A little bit.

3123
02:19:37.16 --> 02:19:42.16
But hey, I don't know from a, from a, if you go from like the level that you're currently cruising out,

3124
02:19:42.16 --> 02:19:43.16
yeah.

3125
02:19:43.16 --> 02:19:46.16
Maybe you both have to travel the same distance.

3126
02:19:46.16 --> 02:19:47.16
Yeah.

3127
02:19:47.16 --> 02:19:48.16
Yeah.

3128
02:19:48.16 --> 02:19:49.16
It is relatively dark.

3129
02:19:49.16 --> 02:19:50.16
Well, it's at least here.

3130
02:19:50.16 --> 02:19:51.16
I think you're right.

3131
02:19:51.16 --> 02:19:52.16
And yeah.

3132
02:19:52.16 --> 02:19:53.16
But not just geese, right?

3133
02:19:53.16 --> 02:19:54.16
No, no, no.

3134
02:19:54.16 --> 02:19:55.16
But just shorts.

3135
02:19:55.16 --> 02:19:56.16
You know, a peril.

3136
02:19:56.16 --> 02:20:00.92
Everything is, you know, our t-shirts are knit like we have a partner that knits, knits all the

3137
02:20:00.92 --> 02:20:04.68
fabric, like six hours away or something.

3138
02:20:04.68 --> 02:20:07.16
Everything's, everything's sourced and made here.

3139
02:20:07.16 --> 02:20:11.96
You know, when we make all our own compression of peril, like cutting so and sublimate,

3140
02:20:11.96 --> 02:20:13.16
die sublimation, everything.

3141
02:20:13.16 --> 02:20:15.16
You say compression of peril.

3142
02:20:15.16 --> 02:20:16.16
Yeah.

3143
02:20:16.16 --> 02:20:17.16
I still call the rashguard.

3144
02:20:17.16 --> 02:20:18.16
It's a rashguard.

3145
02:20:18.16 --> 02:20:19.16
I know.

3146
02:20:19.16 --> 02:20:20.16
I'm just, you know what I say compression of them.

3147
02:20:20.16 --> 02:20:21.16
Yeah.

3148
02:20:21.16 --> 02:20:22.16
Because I know it's not just the rashguard or rashguard is for surfing.

3149
02:20:22.16 --> 02:20:22.16
Right.

3150
02:20:22.16 --> 02:20:25.16
But, but, but, but, like the, like, the pants.

3151
02:20:25.16 --> 02:20:26.16
The pants.

3152
02:20:26.16 --> 02:20:27.16
The pants.

3153
02:20:27.16 --> 02:20:28.16
They're calling it in the jujitsu community.

3154
02:20:28.16 --> 02:20:30.16
Don't we still say, yeah, I got a new rashguard.

3155
02:20:30.16 --> 02:20:31.16
Oh, yeah.

3156
02:20:31.16 --> 02:20:32.16
We still say.

3157
02:20:32.16 --> 02:20:33.16
I'm just making sure.

3158
02:20:33.16 --> 02:20:34.16
Yeah.

3159
02:20:34.16 --> 02:20:37.16
Because I wasn't like hearing someone at the gym saying, like, did you check out this new compression?

3160
02:20:37.16 --> 02:20:40.16
But in the wake room, there is, they do say that.

3161
02:20:40.16 --> 02:20:41.16
Yeah.

3162
02:20:41.16 --> 02:20:42.16
Because I, right.

3163
02:20:42.16 --> 02:20:43.16
I see like in football.

3164
02:20:43.16 --> 02:20:44.16
Yeah.

3165
02:20:44.16 --> 02:20:47.16
Like you'll see some company that's advertising compression.

3166
02:20:47.16 --> 02:20:48.16
Yeah.

3167
02:20:48.16 --> 02:20:49.16
Yeah.

3168
02:20:49.16 --> 02:20:50.16
Yeah.

3169
02:20:50.16 --> 02:20:51.16
Exactly.

3170
02:20:51.16 --> 02:20:52.16
But it's not, it's not on me.

3171
02:20:52.16 --> 02:20:57.16
You got to remember like every textiles different than what you used to, like, like, the

3172
02:20:57.16 --> 02:21:03.16
Warpwick we use our our textile for the rashguard or tits or whatever else.

3173
02:21:03.16 --> 02:21:04.16
It's different.

3174
02:21:04.16 --> 02:21:06.16
And you just called them tites.

3175
02:21:06.16 --> 02:21:07.16
I did because spats.

3176
02:21:07.16 --> 02:21:09.16
I have no idea what a spat is.

3177
02:21:09.16 --> 02:21:11.16
I'm just going to say out in California.

3178
02:21:11.16 --> 02:21:13.16
It's definitely called spats.

3179
02:21:13.16 --> 02:21:14.16
Yeah.

3180
02:21:14.16 --> 02:21:16.16
And I don't even know where that word comes from.

3181
02:21:16.16 --> 02:21:17.16
Brought spats.

3182
02:21:17.16 --> 02:21:19.16
I knew spats is when you tape your ankles.

3183
02:21:19.16 --> 02:21:20.16
It's a spat around the fleet.

3184
02:21:20.16 --> 02:21:21.16
Yeah.

3185
02:21:21.16 --> 02:21:22.16
You spat your legs.

3186
02:21:22.16 --> 02:21:23.16
But why did they even cut that?

3187
02:21:23.16 --> 02:21:24.16
I bet you.

3188
02:21:24.16 --> 02:21:25.16
I bet you.

3189
02:21:25.16 --> 02:21:26.16
Wait.

3190
02:21:26.16 --> 02:21:28.16
Did the spats go down your leg?

3191
02:21:28.16 --> 02:21:29.16
Like tights and then around your foot.

3192
02:21:29.16 --> 02:21:30.16
It was just tape over.

3193
02:21:30.16 --> 02:21:32.16
You know, it just crinkles.

3194
02:21:32.16 --> 02:21:34.16
But instead of your ankles under your socks.

3195
02:21:34.16 --> 02:21:35.16
Yeah.

3196
02:21:35.16 --> 02:21:36.16
Yeah.

3197
02:21:36.16 --> 02:21:37.16
tape over.

3198
02:21:37.16 --> 02:21:38.16
Over.

3199
02:21:38.16 --> 02:21:39.16
You shoe over everything.

3200
02:21:39.16 --> 02:21:40.16
Which is trainer stop doing because it's.

3201
02:21:40.16 --> 02:21:41.16
So why don't we call him compression.

3202
02:21:41.16 --> 02:21:42.16
I tell him this cool.

3203
02:21:42.16 --> 02:21:43.16
Yeah.

3204
02:21:43.16 --> 02:21:47.16
Because I'm going to be, you know, earlier we got kind of like wrapped around or we got

3205
02:21:47.16 --> 02:21:52.16
a side track about me being sensitive about something or not being sensitive.

3206
02:21:52.16 --> 02:21:53.16
Tights.

3207
02:21:53.16 --> 02:21:54.16
You're not down for time.

3208
02:21:54.16 --> 02:21:55.16
As a dude.

3209
02:21:55.16 --> 02:21:56.16
Right.

3210
02:21:56.16 --> 02:21:57.16
Don't wear it.

3211
02:21:57.16 --> 02:21:58.16
We're not wearing tights.

3212
02:21:58.16 --> 02:21:59.16
Yeah.

3213
02:21:59.16 --> 02:22:00.16
Compression pants.

3214
02:22:00.16 --> 02:22:01.16
That's a good compression shirt.

3215
02:22:01.16 --> 02:22:02.16
See.

3216
02:22:02.16 --> 02:22:03.16
There you go.

3217
02:22:03.16 --> 02:22:04.16
Compression shirt.

3218
02:22:04.16 --> 02:22:05.16
And rash pants.

3219
02:22:05.16 --> 02:22:06.16
Rashed guard pants.

3220
02:22:06.16 --> 02:22:07.16
That doesn't make sense either.

3221
02:22:07.16 --> 02:22:08.16
Doesn't.

3222
02:22:08.16 --> 02:22:09.16
Even though they do prevent rashes.

3223
02:22:09.16 --> 02:22:10.16
Just see if you're sure.

3224
02:22:10.16 --> 02:22:12.16
Or do you do it to that burn?

3225
02:22:12.16 --> 02:22:13.16
Okay.

3226
02:22:13.16 --> 02:22:16.16
You know why people, you know why a lot of people wear compression pants and compression shirts.

3227
02:22:16.16 --> 02:22:17.16
Injuditsu.

3228
02:22:17.16 --> 02:22:20.16
The prevention of the disease.

3229
02:22:20.16 --> 02:22:21.16
The funk.

3230
02:22:21.16 --> 02:22:22.16
Yeah.

3231
02:22:22.16 --> 02:22:23.16
Right.

3232
02:22:23.16 --> 02:22:24.16
They don't want the hanghorm.

3233
02:22:24.16 --> 02:22:25.16
Right.

3234
02:22:25.16 --> 02:22:26.16
They don't want that hanghorm.

3235
02:22:26.16 --> 02:22:28.16
They don't want, you know, whatever.

3236
02:22:28.16 --> 02:22:29.16
Very immersive.

3237
02:22:29.16 --> 02:22:31.16
That's what people wear that.

3238
02:22:31.16 --> 02:22:32.16
And you know.

3239
02:22:32.16 --> 02:22:36.16
The people that I know that wear it, they seem to believe in it.

3240
02:22:36.16 --> 02:22:37.16
Oh, yeah.

3241
02:22:37.16 --> 02:22:39.16
Just the level of it's not like a.

3242
02:22:39.16 --> 02:22:41.16
Like the, what's the sun protection?

3243
02:22:41.16 --> 02:22:42.16
Right.

3244
02:22:42.16 --> 02:22:43.16
That's 50.

3245
02:22:43.16 --> 02:22:44.16
Or yeah.

3246
02:22:44.16 --> 02:22:45.16
So you, you pf, you pf.

3247
02:22:45.16 --> 02:22:46.16
Right.

3248
02:22:46.16 --> 02:22:47.16
You pf 50.

3249
02:22:47.16 --> 02:22:50.16
There's no anti ringworm percentage rating.

3250
02:22:50.16 --> 02:22:51.16
Right.

3251
02:22:51.16 --> 02:22:52.16
Right.

3252
02:22:52.16 --> 02:22:54.16
There's just the general anti microbeal.

3253
02:22:54.16 --> 02:22:55.16
Right.

3254
02:22:55.16 --> 02:22:59.16
Like, but that keeps it from growing in the material.

3255
02:22:59.16 --> 02:23:05.16
What I'm saying is if you wear like a compression shirt and compression pants,

3256
02:23:05.16 --> 02:23:06.16
Sure.

3257
02:23:06.16 --> 02:23:10.16
Then you're not rubbing your skin against some savage that came into the gym with ringworm.

3258
02:23:10.16 --> 02:23:11.16
Right.

3259
02:23:11.16 --> 02:23:12.16
So you have less percentage.

3260
02:23:12.16 --> 02:23:13.16
Or rolling with him too.

3261
02:23:13.16 --> 02:23:14.16
Yeah.

3262
02:23:14.16 --> 02:23:15.16
You don't need that.

3263
02:23:15.16 --> 02:23:16.16
So you don't want that time.

3264
02:23:16.16 --> 02:23:21.16
That's a good reason to wear compression gear.

3265
02:23:21.16 --> 02:23:22.16
Cross the board.

3266
02:23:22.16 --> 02:23:23.16
And the rash cards.

3267
02:23:23.16 --> 02:23:24.16
Right.

3268
02:23:24.16 --> 02:23:25.16
Like they're.

3269
02:23:25.16 --> 02:23:29.16
Now they're not like the rash cards you're used to.

3270
02:23:29.16 --> 02:23:36.16
The ones you put on and then they on talk and then you talk to me and they on talk and you talk to me and they're designed to stay tucked in.

3271
02:23:36.16 --> 02:23:41.16
So you put them on and the way the fibers flex and bend with your body.

3272
02:23:41.16 --> 02:23:46.16
It's not your mother's or grandma's rash card.

3273
02:23:46.16 --> 02:23:50.16
So when you say tucked in because you don't really tuck in a rash card, right?

3274
02:23:50.16 --> 02:23:51.16
Or do you.

3275
02:23:51.16 --> 02:23:53.16
You're talking about under the gear.

3276
02:23:53.16 --> 02:23:54.16
Yeah.

3277
02:23:54.16 --> 02:23:55.16
Oh, yeah.

3278
02:23:55.16 --> 02:23:56.16
Yeah.

3279
02:23:56.16 --> 02:23:57.16
That's a whole new world.

3280
02:23:57.16 --> 02:23:58.16
Yeah.

3281
02:23:58.16 --> 02:24:00.16
Some places make you wear rash card under your gear.

3282
02:24:00.16 --> 02:24:01.16
Yeah.

3283
02:24:01.16 --> 02:24:03.16
I think it's good to have a rash card under your gear.

3284
02:24:03.16 --> 02:24:04.16
I know a lot of people think that.

3285
02:24:04.16 --> 02:24:05.16
It's not traditional.

3286
02:24:05.16 --> 02:24:07.16
I mean, I'm just reddish.

3287
02:24:07.16 --> 02:24:08.16
Yeah.

3288
02:24:08.16 --> 02:24:09.16
It's not like what you like.

3289
02:24:09.16 --> 02:24:11.16
I like the barrier.

3290
02:24:11.16 --> 02:24:13.16
I like the I like the g-

3291
02:24:13.16 --> 02:24:16.16
The rash or the I like the barrier.

3292
02:24:16.16 --> 02:24:19.16
Between the the fabric and the skin.

3293
02:24:19.16 --> 02:24:22.16
I like the compression because you compression muscle.

3294
02:24:22.16 --> 02:24:24.16
You get more use.

3295
02:24:24.16 --> 02:24:26.16
You're straight performance performance.

3296
02:24:26.16 --> 02:24:27.16
Yep.

3297
02:24:27.16 --> 02:24:27.16
Got it.

3298
02:24:27.16 --> 02:24:28.16
Absolutely.

3299
02:24:28.16 --> 02:24:33.16
The g-slides a little bit better on a rash card than it does your skin once it's all sweaty up and sticky.

3300
02:24:33.16 --> 02:24:34.16
Right.

3301
02:24:34.16 --> 02:24:35.16
So that's why you use it.

3302
02:24:35.16 --> 02:24:37.16
And I'm a hairy creek.

3303
02:24:37.16 --> 02:24:39.16
No one's the chest hair.

3304
02:24:39.16 --> 02:24:40.16
That's right.

3305
02:24:40.16 --> 02:24:41.16
You don't want that be no.

3306
02:24:41.16 --> 02:24:42.16
Yeah.

3307
02:24:42.16 --> 02:24:44.16
You're eat would be happy if we all wore rash cards.

3308
02:24:44.16 --> 02:24:48.16
She's our black belt at our gym female.

3309
02:24:48.16 --> 02:24:49.16
Mm-hmm.

3310
02:24:49.16 --> 02:24:53.16
And she is still a girl.

3311
02:24:53.16 --> 02:24:55.16
So things like chest hairs.

3312
02:24:55.16 --> 02:24:56.16
Yeah.

3313
02:24:56.16 --> 02:24:58.16
She's not happy about those things.

3314
02:24:58.16 --> 02:25:02.16
She begs me to wear, you know, something under my geek.

3315
02:25:02.16 --> 02:25:03.16
She's so far failed.

3316
02:25:03.16 --> 02:25:04.16
Ha ha.

3317
02:25:04.16 --> 02:25:05.16
She failed on my problem.

3318
02:25:05.16 --> 02:25:06.16
Oh, yeah.

3319
02:25:06.16 --> 02:25:13.16
But, um, you know, the other thing is, you, we didn't talk about origin main dot com is supplements.

3320
02:25:13.16 --> 02:25:14.16
Absolutely.

3321
02:25:14.16 --> 02:25:17.16
So on the body and in your body, there you go.

3322
02:25:17.16 --> 02:25:18.16
It's it.

3323
02:25:18.16 --> 02:25:19.16
Yeah.

3324
02:25:19.16 --> 02:25:23.16
We're going to put everything you need on your body and everything you need in your body.

3325
02:25:23.16 --> 02:25:24.16
Crill oil.

3326
02:25:24.16 --> 02:25:24.16
Yep.

3327
02:25:24.16 --> 02:25:26.16
That's really, that's the, that's the one.

3328
02:25:26.16 --> 02:25:28.16
Now it's acrylic oil and then it's super acrylic oil.

3329
02:25:28.16 --> 02:25:32.16
One of the things that, um, you know, you'll be happy, you know, that peat and I,

3330
02:25:32.16 --> 02:25:34.16
we like to make things happen.

3331
02:25:34.16 --> 02:25:39.16
And, you know, obviously, I'm a big fan of acrylic oil, for instance.

3332
02:25:39.16 --> 02:25:45.16
So, you know, I was, I used to be a fan of white tea, a big fan.

3333
02:25:45.16 --> 02:25:46.16
And I drank it a lot.

3334
02:25:46.16 --> 02:25:48.16
And eventually I said, you know what I need?

3335
02:25:48.16 --> 02:25:50.16
This is Jockel white tea.

3336
02:25:50.16 --> 02:25:54.16
And so I had a similar thing happen with acrylic.

3337
02:25:54.16 --> 02:25:56.16
I want to have acrylic oil.

3338
02:25:56.16 --> 02:25:57.16
Good acrylic oil.

3339
02:25:57.16 --> 02:25:59.16
So you know what we're making?

3340
02:25:59.16 --> 02:26:00.16
Good acrylic oil.

3341
02:26:00.16 --> 02:26:01.16
Yeah.

3342
02:26:01.16 --> 02:26:03.16
Actually, we like to call it Jockel super.

3343
02:26:03.16 --> 02:26:05.16
Super acrylic oil.

3344
02:26:05.16 --> 02:26:07.16
So Jockel super acrylic.

3345
02:26:07.16 --> 02:26:12.16
We're making that awesome quality.

3346
02:26:12.16 --> 02:26:16.16
On top of that, we got a little again.

3347
02:26:16.16 --> 02:26:19.16
Little, we need joint maintenance, right?

3348
02:26:19.16 --> 02:26:24.16
Any joint maintenance when we are active, when we're training Jitsu, when we're Jack and Big Steel.

3349
02:26:24.16 --> 02:26:28.16
We are turned into everything, going a little bit slower.

3350
02:26:28.16 --> 02:26:32.16
So we might not admit to it in public, just like we wouldn't admit to crying.

3351
02:26:32.16 --> 02:26:33.16
Right?

3352
02:26:33.16 --> 02:26:37.16
On a public situation, ever, I'm comfortable with my masculine baby.

3353
02:26:37.16 --> 02:26:39.16
I'm over here, not crying.

3354
02:26:39.16 --> 02:26:40.16
No, don't cry.

3355
02:26:40.16 --> 02:26:41.16
Don't cry.

3356
02:26:41.16 --> 02:26:46.16
My wife says, the only time you cry is babies and belts.

3357
02:26:46.16 --> 02:26:49.16
Someone gets promoted and someone has a kid.

3358
02:26:49.16 --> 02:26:51.16
What about weddings?

3359
02:26:51.16 --> 02:26:52.16
No.

3360
02:26:52.16 --> 02:26:53.16
No.

3361
02:26:53.16 --> 02:26:54.16
Funerals and weddings.

3362
02:26:54.16 --> 02:26:57.16
So we got another thing we're coming out with.

3363
02:26:57.16 --> 02:27:01.16
It's, uh, Jocco, joint warfare.

3364
02:27:01.16 --> 02:27:06.16
For your joints, go to war against the pain.

3365
02:27:06.16 --> 02:27:08.16
Inflammation, go to war.

3366
02:27:08.16 --> 02:27:09.16
Inflammation, inflammation.

3367
02:27:09.16 --> 02:27:10.16
Inflammation, inflammation.

3368
02:27:10.16 --> 02:27:11.16
Oh, that's up.

3369
02:27:11.16 --> 02:27:12.16
I'll end them easy.

3370
02:27:12.16 --> 02:27:13.16
Yeah.

3371
02:27:13.16 --> 02:27:17.16
I've been kicking it for since we, since we originally formulated.

3372
02:27:17.16 --> 02:27:18.16
Yep.

3373
02:27:18.16 --> 02:27:19.16
And I got the samples.

3374
02:27:19.16 --> 02:27:22.16
I went on it hardcore and it's legit.

3375
02:27:22.16 --> 02:27:23.16
Yeah.

3376
02:27:23.16 --> 02:27:24.16
Yeah.

3377
02:27:24.16 --> 02:27:25.16
I legit.

3378
02:27:25.16 --> 02:27:26.16
across the board.

3379
02:27:26.16 --> 02:27:28.16
I still want about that.

3380
02:27:28.16 --> 02:27:32.16
I have like bad back from sports and stuff.

3381
02:27:32.16 --> 02:27:35.16
Herniated disc, bulging disc.

3382
02:27:35.16 --> 02:27:36.16
Didn't get surgery.

3383
02:27:36.16 --> 02:27:38.16
Severe arthritis.

3384
02:27:38.16 --> 02:27:42.16
I can train seven days a week if I want to do as a matter of fact.

3385
02:27:42.16 --> 02:27:44.16
We have our immersion campus week.

3386
02:27:44.16 --> 02:27:45.16
Train every day.

3387
02:27:45.16 --> 02:27:46.16
Get some.

3388
02:27:46.16 --> 02:27:47.16
Every day.

3389
02:27:47.16 --> 02:27:48.16
That's it.

3390
02:27:48.16 --> 02:27:49.16
Joint warfare.

3391
02:27:49.16 --> 02:27:50.16
Yep.

3392
02:27:50.16 --> 02:27:51.16
Keeping it real.

3393
02:27:51.16 --> 02:27:52.16
So that stuff.

3394
02:27:52.16 --> 02:27:54.16
We, it's being manufactured.

3395
02:27:54.16 --> 02:27:56.16
We, I've been on the samples for what?

3396
02:27:56.16 --> 02:27:58.16
A month and a half.

3397
02:27:58.16 --> 02:28:03.16
And now it's been being manufactured in America.

3398
02:28:03.16 --> 02:28:04.16
Check.

3399
02:28:04.16 --> 02:28:08.16
And very close by right by a partner.

3400
02:28:08.16 --> 02:28:09.16
Right.

3401
02:28:09.16 --> 02:28:12.16
And so it's going to be on the website now.

3402
02:28:12.16 --> 02:28:13.16
Pre-order it.

3403
02:28:13.16 --> 02:28:16.16
And that way we can get to get a feel for how much.

3404
02:28:16.16 --> 02:28:17.16
Because we got a bunch coming.

3405
02:28:17.16 --> 02:28:18.16
Mm-hmm.

3406
02:28:18.16 --> 02:28:21.16
We need to figure out how much of a bunch is that actually means.

3407
02:28:21.16 --> 02:28:22.16
Yeah.

3408
02:28:22.16 --> 02:28:24.16
So kind of like with Jocco White tea.

3409
02:28:24.16 --> 02:28:25.16
I didn't do that.

3410
02:28:25.16 --> 02:28:26.16
I was going to walk away.

3411
02:28:26.16 --> 02:28:27.16
Tea for sale.

3412
02:28:27.16 --> 02:28:28.16
It was gone.

3413
02:28:28.16 --> 02:28:29.16
Yeah.

3414
02:28:29.16 --> 02:28:30.16
I'm going to order some more.

3415
02:28:30.16 --> 02:28:31.16
And then that was gone.

3416
02:28:31.16 --> 02:28:33.16
And people were really getting angry because when you, you know, when you have

3417
02:28:33.16 --> 02:28:34.16
a Jocco White tea.

3418
02:28:34.16 --> 02:28:36.16
And then you don't have it.

3419
02:28:36.16 --> 02:28:38.16
All of a sudden, you know, you things start going sideways.

3420
02:28:38.16 --> 02:28:39.16
Yeah.

3421
02:28:39.16 --> 02:28:40.16
Absolutely.

3422
02:28:40.16 --> 02:28:41.16
So you're going to get that extra.

3423
02:28:41.16 --> 02:28:44.16
So anyways, you can check those things out.

3424
02:28:44.16 --> 02:28:45.16
OriginMain.com.

3425
02:28:45.16 --> 02:28:46.16
There'll be there.

3426
02:28:46.16 --> 02:28:47.16
Joint warfare.

3427
02:28:47.16 --> 02:28:48.16
You like that, don't you?

3428
02:28:48.16 --> 02:28:49.16
I do.

3429
02:28:49.16 --> 02:28:50.16
Yeah.

3430
02:28:50.16 --> 02:28:51.16
Yeah.

3431
02:28:51.16 --> 02:28:52.16
There's a layer on there.

3432
02:28:52.16 --> 02:28:53.16
Yeah.

3433
02:28:53.16 --> 02:28:54.16
That's deep.

3434
02:28:54.16 --> 02:28:55.16
Yeah.

3435
02:28:55.16 --> 02:28:56.16
Yeah.

3436
02:28:56.16 --> 02:28:59.16
The one person that's going to get this layer is Dean Lister.

3437
02:28:59.16 --> 02:29:00.16
Yep.

3438
02:29:00.16 --> 02:29:01.16
Yep.

3439
02:29:01.16 --> 02:29:02.16
Trebuji.

3440
02:29:02.16 --> 02:29:03.16
I'll leave it at that.

3441
02:29:03.16 --> 02:29:04.16
Oh, you know Trebuji.

3442
02:29:04.16 --> 02:29:05.16
Yeah.

3443
02:29:05.16 --> 02:29:06.16
Yeah.

3444
02:29:06.16 --> 02:29:07.16
A lot of moving parts on a Trebuji.

3445
02:29:07.16 --> 02:29:08.16
Yeah.

3446
02:29:08.16 --> 02:29:09.16
Gotta keep him grease.

3447
02:29:09.16 --> 02:29:11.16
Gotta keep that joint.

3448
02:29:11.16 --> 02:29:12.16
Sure.

3449
02:29:12.16 --> 02:29:15.16
Also speaking of Jack and steel.

3450
02:29:15.16 --> 02:29:16.16
Can't help bells.

3451
02:29:16.16 --> 02:29:18.16
So when we came here, we're in Main right now.

3452
02:29:18.16 --> 02:29:21.16
People haven't gathered that already.

3453
02:29:21.16 --> 02:29:22.16
Up in camp.

3454
02:29:22.16 --> 02:29:23.16
No.

3455
02:29:23.16 --> 02:29:24.16
There's a big weight room.

3456
02:29:24.16 --> 02:29:25.16
Right.

3457
02:29:25.16 --> 02:29:26.16
Kinda.

3458
02:29:26.16 --> 02:29:27.16
There's a little fitness center there.

3459
02:29:27.16 --> 02:29:28.16
Yeah.

3460
02:29:28.16 --> 02:29:29.16
First night, we get here.

3461
02:29:29.16 --> 02:29:30.16
One guys, they came.

3462
02:29:30.16 --> 02:29:31.16
I brought my on it.

3463
02:29:31.16 --> 02:29:32.16
Kettlebell.

3464
02:29:32.16 --> 02:29:33.16
Yeah.

3465
02:29:33.16 --> 02:29:34.16
Seven.

3466
02:29:34.16 --> 02:29:35.16
Yeah.

3467
02:29:35.16 --> 02:29:36.16
John.

3468
02:29:36.16 --> 02:29:37.16
Yeah.

3469
02:29:37.16 --> 02:29:38.16
It was John.

3470
02:29:38.16 --> 02:29:39.16
Yeah.

3471
02:29:39.16 --> 02:29:40.16
Yeah.

3472
02:29:40.16 --> 02:29:41.16
On a kettlebell.

3473
02:29:41.16 --> 02:29:42.16
The gorilla.

3474
02:29:42.16 --> 02:29:43.16
On a regular.

3475
02:29:43.16 --> 02:29:44.16
Yeah.

3476
02:29:44.16 --> 02:29:46.16
That's the good ones.

3477
02:29:46.16 --> 02:29:47.16
You do kettlebells?

3478
02:29:47.16 --> 02:29:48.16
I don't.

3479
02:29:48.16 --> 02:29:49.16
You stopped lifting that.

3480
02:29:49.16 --> 02:29:50.16
Oh, that's right.

3481
02:29:50.16 --> 02:29:51.16
Stop.

3482
02:29:51.16 --> 02:29:52.16
I did.

3483
02:29:52.16 --> 02:29:53.16
Well, kettlebell.

3484
02:29:53.16 --> 02:29:54.16
Two massive.

3485
02:29:54.16 --> 02:29:57.16
I don't want to bring this up because we talked about this pre-recording.

3486
02:29:57.16 --> 02:29:58.16
Yeah.

3487
02:29:58.16 --> 02:30:00.16
So you wait 250 feet right now as we talked about.

3488
02:30:00.16 --> 02:30:01.16
You used to wait 280 five.

3489
02:30:01.16 --> 02:30:02.16
And I asked this question.

3490
02:30:02.16 --> 02:30:06.16
And this is a good question that everybody should kind of hear the answer to.

3491
02:30:06.16 --> 02:30:11.16
Could the 250,000 250 pound.

3492
02:30:11.16 --> 02:30:12.16
Yeah.

3493
02:30:12.16 --> 02:30:14.16
Pete beat the 285 pound.

3494
02:30:14.16 --> 02:30:15.16
Pete in a grappling match.

3495
02:30:15.16 --> 02:30:17.16
And your answer was 100%.

3496
02:30:17.16 --> 02:30:19.16
The smaller guy wins.

3497
02:30:19.16 --> 02:30:20.16
Yes.

3498
02:30:20.16 --> 02:30:21.16
Why is that?

3499
02:30:21.16 --> 02:30:23.16
I mean, lots of reasons.

3500
02:30:23.16 --> 02:30:26.16
You're more flexible, better positioning.

3501
02:30:26.16 --> 02:30:30.16
Better escapes because it's less mass burning less oxygen.

3502
02:30:30.16 --> 02:30:32.16
Because you have less muscle mass.

3503
02:30:32.16 --> 02:30:40.16
And for me, I would wear the 285 version of myself out.

3504
02:30:40.16 --> 02:30:41.16
Right.

3505
02:30:41.16 --> 02:30:43.16
So it's, I stop.

3506
02:30:43.16 --> 02:30:45.16
And I love lifting weights.

3507
02:30:45.16 --> 02:30:47.16
I love lifting weights.

3508
02:30:47.16 --> 02:30:50.16
But for me, you do two fulfills the void because it is resistance.

3509
02:30:50.16 --> 02:30:52.16
You're always working.

3510
02:30:52.16 --> 02:30:53.16
I never feel out of shape.

3511
02:30:53.16 --> 02:30:56.16
Well, unless I have too many will be pies.

3512
02:30:56.16 --> 02:30:57.16
What?

3513
02:30:57.16 --> 02:30:59.16
Did you do anything to work out besides GJ2?

3514
02:30:59.16 --> 02:31:00.16
No.

3515
02:31:00.16 --> 02:31:01.16
Do you run?

3516
02:31:01.16 --> 02:31:02.16
Do you sprint?

3517
02:31:02.16 --> 02:31:03.16
No.

3518
02:31:03.16 --> 02:31:05.16
Just pure GJ2.

3519
02:31:05.16 --> 02:31:07.16
I do Dean Mr. tells me that.

3520
02:31:07.16 --> 02:31:08.16
Yeah.

3521
02:31:08.16 --> 02:31:11.16
When Dean Mr. doesn't want to work out, doesn't want to do any, you know,

3522
02:31:11.16 --> 02:31:12.16
sprints.

3523
02:31:12.16 --> 02:31:14.16
He's like, man, I get it from GJ2.

3524
02:31:14.16 --> 02:31:16.16
That's what I'm best thing.

3525
02:31:16.16 --> 02:31:18.16
So now you're supporting his argument.

3526
02:31:18.16 --> 02:31:20.16
Now I get it. Now I got to deal with that.

3527
02:31:20.16 --> 02:31:22.16
Would you be Robert said, you know,

3528
02:31:22.16 --> 02:31:23.16
What is that?

3529
02:31:23.16 --> 02:31:25.16
Well, we'll talk about some day.

3530
02:31:25.16 --> 02:31:27.16
How GJ2 makes you unathletic.

3531
02:31:27.16 --> 02:31:28.16
Oh, really?

3532
02:31:28.16 --> 02:31:29.16
That's a whole other talk.

3533
02:31:29.16 --> 02:31:30.16
Interesting.

3534
02:31:30.16 --> 02:31:35.16
And I have facts on why it makes you unathletic.

3535
02:31:35.16 --> 02:31:38.16
What it keeps you, it keeps your body together.

3536
02:31:38.16 --> 02:31:39.16
You're caught together.

3537
02:31:39.16 --> 02:31:40.16
You're muscle strong.

3538
02:31:40.16 --> 02:31:42.16
So what does it do to make you unathletic?

3539
02:31:42.16 --> 02:31:43.16
It's slow movement.

3540
02:31:43.16 --> 02:31:44.16
You slow.

3541
02:31:44.16 --> 02:31:45.16
You start when you start GJ2.

3542
02:31:45.16 --> 02:31:46.16
Your body slows down.

3543
02:31:46.16 --> 02:31:48.16
Your mind slows down. Your muscle slowed down.

3544
02:31:48.16 --> 02:31:52.16
Whatever you had for fast twitch turns the slow twitch because you're pulling and

3545
02:31:52.16 --> 02:31:54.16
tugging and you're moving slow.

3546
02:31:54.16 --> 02:31:56.16
I used to be able to dunk a basketball.

3547
02:31:56.16 --> 02:31:58.16
So every dunk can touch the rim now.

3548
02:31:58.16 --> 02:32:00.16
I think we need to.

3549
02:32:00.16 --> 02:32:06.16
I will go ahead and defend the GJ2 over here on my side of the table.

3550
02:32:06.16 --> 02:32:12.16
Because if you continue to do cleans and you continue to squat.

3551
02:32:12.16 --> 02:32:13.16
Yeah.

3552
02:32:13.16 --> 02:32:19.16
And you continue to sprint and mobility drills and agility drills.

3553
02:32:19.16 --> 02:32:21.16
You can keep that athleticism.

3554
02:32:21.16 --> 02:32:22.16
I think you're right.

3555
02:32:22.16 --> 02:32:23.16
I know you're right.

3556
02:32:23.16 --> 02:32:24.16
Jack.

3557
02:32:24.16 --> 02:32:26.16
That's what I did when I competed.

3558
02:32:26.16 --> 02:32:27.16
I had a strength in conditioning.

3559
02:32:27.16 --> 02:32:28.16
Oh, yeah.

3560
02:32:28.16 --> 02:32:30.16
Sprint lift push pull.

3561
02:32:30.16 --> 02:32:33.16
So I guess big picture is one of those deals where it kind of

3562
02:32:33.16 --> 02:32:38.16
confirms the idea that you don't have to be athletic to do good in GJ2.

3563
02:32:38.16 --> 02:32:40.16
Generally speaking,

3564
02:32:40.16 --> 02:32:43.16
but if you want to do some kind of athletic competition,

3565
02:32:43.16 --> 02:32:46.16
including but not limited to GJ2,

3566
02:32:46.16 --> 02:32:48.16
it helps to be athletic.

3567
02:32:48.16 --> 02:32:49.16
Jack's a material.

3568
02:32:49.16 --> 02:32:50.16
Yeah.

3569
02:32:50.16 --> 02:32:53.16
I'm kind of glad that you kind of hit him with that because when I said I stopped doing

3570
02:32:53.16 --> 02:32:56.16
like legs and stuff like that, I got a lot of crap for it.

3571
02:32:56.16 --> 02:32:57.16
Yeah.

3572
02:32:57.16 --> 02:33:01.16
You know, I did a lot of squats and college.

3573
02:33:01.16 --> 02:33:02.16
Yeah.

3574
02:33:02.16 --> 02:33:03.16
You put all college football.

3575
02:33:03.16 --> 02:33:04.16
Hell yeah.

3576
02:33:04.16 --> 02:33:06.16
I'm scared of them.

3577
02:33:06.16 --> 02:33:08.16
I like hacksquats.

3578
02:33:08.16 --> 02:33:10.16
Man, for sure.

3579
02:33:10.16 --> 02:33:11.16
You got bad knees or something?

3580
02:33:11.16 --> 02:33:12.16
Bad back.

3581
02:33:12.16 --> 02:33:13.16
Bad back.

3582
02:33:13.16 --> 02:33:14.16
Yeah.

3583
02:33:14.16 --> 02:33:17.16
That last time I squatted and I hit the floor, right?

3584
02:33:17.16 --> 02:33:19.16
Of course, bad back.

3585
02:33:19.16 --> 02:33:24.16
Bad back from years of major and personal question.

3586
02:33:24.16 --> 02:33:32.16
Does your ego not allow you to get in there and do 185 pounds for some higher reps?

3587
02:33:32.16 --> 02:33:33.16
Nope.

3588
02:33:33.16 --> 02:33:34.16
I do that 100%.

3589
02:33:34.16 --> 02:33:35.16
But you still don't like it.

3590
02:33:35.16 --> 02:33:36.16
I do hacksquats.

3591
02:33:36.16 --> 02:33:38.16
I still don't like it.

3592
02:33:38.16 --> 02:33:39.16
But I mean, it's.

3593
02:33:39.16 --> 02:33:44.16
Steel is great.

3594
02:33:44.16 --> 02:33:44.16
Yeah.

3595
02:33:44.16 --> 02:33:45.16
That's the bottom line.

3596
02:33:45.16 --> 02:33:46.16
Yeah.

3597
02:33:46.16 --> 02:33:47.16
It is great.

3598
02:33:47.16 --> 02:33:49.16
I just get a 2-JJ2 man.

3599
02:33:49.16 --> 02:33:50.16
I push.

3600
02:33:50.16 --> 02:33:54.16
I do, you know, every time I step on the mats, it's 6-10 minutes rounds and I train to the break.

3601
02:33:54.16 --> 02:33:55.16
So I'm doing 12 minute rounds.

3602
02:33:55.16 --> 02:33:56.16
Nice.

3603
02:33:56.16 --> 02:33:57.16
I make sure to get six.

3604
02:33:57.16 --> 02:33:58.16
Yeah.

3605
02:33:58.16 --> 02:34:01.16
And I get it as things free up.

3606
02:34:01.16 --> 02:34:05.16
And my son wants to lift as he starts the summer.

3607
02:34:05.16 --> 02:34:06.16
I'll get in with him.

3608
02:34:06.16 --> 02:34:07.16
Yeah.

3609
02:34:07.16 --> 02:34:08.16
And we'll press him higher.

3610
02:34:08.16 --> 02:34:09.16
Yeah.

3611
02:34:09.16 --> 02:34:10.16
Yeah.

3612
02:34:10.16 --> 02:34:11.16
Yeah.

3613
02:34:11.16 --> 02:34:12.16
That sounded pretty hard.

3614
02:34:12.16 --> 02:34:13.16
He's all it.

3615
02:34:13.16 --> 02:34:13.16
Yeah.

3616
02:34:13.16 --> 02:34:15.16
If you want to go lift now, look at him.

3617
02:34:15.16 --> 02:34:16.16
You want to go lift.

3618
02:34:16.16 --> 02:34:17.16
Press him higher.

3619
02:34:17.16 --> 02:34:19.16
But kettlebells don't get you that.

3620
02:34:19.16 --> 02:34:22.16
I mean, I'm sure under certain circumstances, you will.

3621
02:34:22.16 --> 02:34:24.16
But they keep your athletic.

3622
02:34:24.16 --> 02:34:25.16
I think you'll.

3623
02:34:25.16 --> 02:34:26.16
Yeah.

3624
02:34:26.16 --> 02:34:26.16
I think you'll.

3625
02:34:26.16 --> 02:34:27.16
Yeah.

3626
02:34:27.16 --> 02:34:28.16
I think you'll.

3627
02:34:28.16 --> 02:34:29.16
Yeah.

3628
02:34:29.16 --> 02:34:30.16
Yeah.

3629
02:34:30.16 --> 02:34:32.16
And the other big thing is when you.

3630
02:34:32.16 --> 02:34:34.16
Like for a kettlebell snatch.

3631
02:34:34.16 --> 02:34:37.16
And when you're swinging motion and when it gets to the top, you have to stop it.

3632
02:34:37.16 --> 02:34:38.16
Right.

3633
02:34:38.16 --> 02:34:39.16
Because otherwise, you're going to rip your shoulder out.

3634
02:34:39.16 --> 02:34:40.16
So you have to use all this.

3635
02:34:40.16 --> 02:34:42.16
Whatever that kind of muscle.

3636
02:34:42.16 --> 02:34:43.16
What is it?

3637
02:34:43.16 --> 02:34:44.16
Echo centric or something.

3638
02:34:44.16 --> 02:34:45.16
What is it?

3639
02:34:45.16 --> 02:34:46.16
Concentric.

3640
02:34:46.16 --> 02:34:47.16
Whatever you got to do this.

3641
02:34:47.16 --> 02:34:48.16
To stop it at the top.

3642
02:34:48.16 --> 02:34:49.16
Yeah.

3643
02:34:49.16 --> 02:34:50.16
You got to stop.

3644
02:34:50.16 --> 02:34:53.16
It's using all these muscles to make that thing happen.

3645
02:34:53.16 --> 02:34:54.16
That's cool.

3646
02:34:54.16 --> 02:34:55.16
Yeah.

3647
02:34:55.16 --> 02:34:56.16
Yeah.

3648
02:34:56.16 --> 02:34:57.16
I want to do it.

3649
02:34:57.16 --> 02:34:58.16
Yeah.

3650
02:34:58.16 --> 02:34:59.16
It's cool.

3651
02:34:59.16 --> 02:35:00.16
I got a chat on.

3652
02:35:00.16 --> 02:35:01.16
It'll get fun.

3653
02:35:01.16 --> 02:35:02.16
Yeah.

3654
02:35:02.16 --> 02:35:03.16
It's a moment.

3655
02:35:03.16 --> 02:35:04.16
I've got to create a moment when you got a balance.

3656
02:35:04.16 --> 02:35:05.16
It's like all this stuff.

3657
02:35:05.16 --> 02:35:06.16
It's fun.

3658
02:35:06.16 --> 02:35:07.16
It's fun.

3659
02:35:07.16 --> 02:35:08.16
College.

3660
02:35:08.16 --> 02:35:10.16
I said the true.

3661
02:35:10.16 --> 02:35:13.16
True test of how strong somebody is is a hankling.

3662
02:35:13.16 --> 02:35:14.16
Yeah.

3663
02:35:14.16 --> 02:35:16.16
They said you could bench a lot.

3664
02:35:16.16 --> 02:35:17.16
You could squat.

3665
02:35:17.16 --> 02:35:18.16
Yeah.

3666
02:35:18.16 --> 02:35:19.16
There's a lot of people.

3667
02:35:19.16 --> 02:35:20.16
Yeah.

3668
02:35:20.16 --> 02:35:21.16
What is there's a lot of things that you could say.

3669
02:35:21.16 --> 02:35:22.16
Like for instance.

3670
02:35:22.16 --> 02:35:23.16
You know, it's a good one overhead squat.

3671
02:35:23.16 --> 02:35:24.16
Oh, you got a great spot.

3672
02:35:24.16 --> 02:35:25.16
It's back.

3673
02:35:25.16 --> 02:35:31.16
If you got a guy that can do massive, big weight and or more medium weight high reps.

3674
02:35:31.16 --> 02:35:32.16
Yeah.

3675
02:35:32.16 --> 02:35:33.16
Yeah.

3676
02:35:33.16 --> 02:35:35.16
But on an hankling, you got to use your speed also.

3677
02:35:35.16 --> 02:35:37.16
It's a little bit explosive.

3678
02:35:37.16 --> 02:35:39.16
So you could just go straight to the snatch.

3679
02:35:39.16 --> 02:35:40.16
Yeah.

3680
02:35:40.16 --> 02:35:41.16
Right.

3681
02:35:41.16 --> 02:35:43.16
But then again, the snatch, you need the balance at the top.

3682
02:35:43.16 --> 02:35:44.16
That's coordination.

3683
02:35:44.16 --> 02:35:45.16
Yeah.

3684
02:35:45.16 --> 02:35:46.16
And you know, all these things.

3685
02:35:46.16 --> 02:35:48.16
So any depends on what you mean by strong too.

3686
02:35:48.16 --> 02:35:53.16
So you know, like, I guess, you know, in certain circles, they cost strength, power

3687
02:35:53.16 --> 02:35:54.16
and strength about two different things.

3688
02:35:54.16 --> 02:35:55.16
And it's like, okay.

3689
02:35:55.16 --> 02:35:56.16
So what are you talking to him?

3690
02:35:56.16 --> 02:35:58.16
So I dig it and I agree actually.

3691
02:35:58.16 --> 02:36:00.16
But this is also 20 years ago.

3692
02:36:00.16 --> 02:36:01.16
Yeah, exactly right.

3693
02:36:01.16 --> 02:36:04.16
If you're in another point to consider, you know, that's a really good change.

3694
02:36:04.16 --> 02:36:05.16
Yeah.

3695
02:36:05.16 --> 02:36:06.16
You agree.

3696
02:36:06.16 --> 02:36:07.16
You said, hey, in clean right.

3697
02:36:07.16 --> 02:36:08.16
Hey, in clean.

3698
02:36:08.16 --> 02:36:10.16
Me is that's a real master.

3699
02:36:10.16 --> 02:36:11.16
Yeah.

3700
02:36:11.16 --> 02:36:12.16
The solid metric.

3701
02:36:12.16 --> 02:36:13.16
Yeah.

3702
02:36:13.16 --> 02:36:14.16
For sure.

3703
02:36:14.16 --> 02:36:15.16
Deadlift another solid metric, by the way.

3704
02:36:15.16 --> 02:36:16.16
Yeah.

3705
02:36:16.16 --> 02:36:17.16
Raw strength.

3706
02:36:17.16 --> 02:36:18.16
That's right.

3707
02:36:18.16 --> 02:36:19.16
Yeah.

3708
02:36:19.16 --> 02:36:19.16
Yeah.

3709
02:36:19.16 --> 02:36:20.16
Yeah.

3710
02:36:20.16 --> 02:36:23.16
Because consider, remember, by like, when you're a kid or maybe old school kind of philosophy,

3711
02:36:23.16 --> 02:36:26.16
it's like, hey, you know, you get the old timer and you're like,

3712
02:36:26.16 --> 02:36:27.16
how strong are you?

3713
02:36:27.16 --> 02:36:28.16
And you're like, real strong.

3714
02:36:28.16 --> 02:36:29.16
Okay.

3715
02:36:29.16 --> 02:36:30.16
Pick that up.

3716
02:36:30.16 --> 02:36:31.16
You know what I mean?

3717
02:36:31.16 --> 02:36:32.16
Okay.

3718
02:36:32.16 --> 02:36:33.16
You can pick it up.

3719
02:36:33.16 --> 02:36:34.16
You're weak.

3720
02:36:34.16 --> 02:36:35.16
You can pick it up.

3721
02:36:35.16 --> 02:36:36.16
Yeah.

3722
02:36:36.16 --> 02:36:38.16
And then the step two is pick it up over your head.

3723
02:36:38.16 --> 02:36:39.16
You got that lift.

3724
02:36:39.16 --> 02:36:40.16
You got lift.

3725
02:36:40.16 --> 02:36:41.16
Yeah.

3726
02:36:41.16 --> 02:36:42.16
Yeah.

3727
02:36:42.16 --> 02:36:43.16
You don't lift.

3728
02:36:43.16 --> 02:36:44.16
No.

3729
02:36:44.16 --> 02:36:45.16
Just kidding.

3730
02:36:45.16 --> 02:36:46.16
Yeah.

3731
02:36:46.16 --> 02:36:47.16
Do you want to do something?

3732
02:36:47.16 --> 02:36:48.16
Let's not do that again.

3733
02:36:48.16 --> 02:36:49.16
You got to get the fire.

3734
02:36:49.16 --> 02:36:50.16
Yeah.

3735
02:36:50.16 --> 02:36:51.16
Yeah.

3736
02:36:51.16 --> 02:36:52.16
Yeah.

3737
02:36:52.16 --> 02:36:53.16
Don't get you nuts with that though.

3738
02:36:53.16 --> 02:36:54.16
Who's that?

3739
02:36:54.16 --> 02:36:55.16
Who's just talking to somebody there?

3740
02:36:55.16 --> 02:36:56.16
There are lots of deadlifts.

3741
02:36:56.16 --> 02:36:57.16
It was Ed.

3742
02:36:57.16 --> 02:36:58.16
Yeah.

3743
02:36:58.16 --> 02:37:00.16
He was like, hey, you know, my back and stuff.

3744
02:37:00.16 --> 02:37:02.16
I was like, don't get crazy with deadlifts.

3745
02:37:02.16 --> 02:37:03.16
No.

3746
02:37:03.16 --> 02:37:06.40
But you can talk to plenty of people that say, oh, I had a bad back.

3747
02:37:06.40 --> 02:37:07.40
And I deadlifted it now.

3748
02:37:07.40 --> 02:37:08.40
It's healed.

3749
02:37:08.40 --> 02:37:09.40
Right.

3750
02:37:09.40 --> 02:37:10.40
Right.

3751
02:37:10.40 --> 02:37:11.40
Plenty of people say that.

3752
02:37:11.40 --> 02:37:12.40
Absolutely.

3753
02:37:12.40 --> 02:37:14.000
Crazy with them because it'll just give you good gems strength.

3754
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.20
Like, your your backs bad because a lot of times anyway, even just anywhere in your

3755
02:37:17.20 --> 02:37:21.08
core is because when you have like some core or the or your back or something, when you

3756
02:37:21.08 --> 02:37:25.16
do stuff, you adjust to not use it, you know, so deadlift.

3757
02:37:25.16 --> 02:37:26.16
Yeah.

3758
02:37:26.16 --> 02:37:27.16
You're using it.

3759
02:37:27.16 --> 02:37:29.72
So now when you do some thing, you're grabbing the cranberry juice from this side.

3760
02:37:29.72 --> 02:37:30.72
You're going to put it over here.

3761
02:37:30.72 --> 02:37:31.72
You had a bottle of floor.

3762
02:37:31.72 --> 02:37:32.72
Yeah.

3763
02:37:32.72 --> 02:37:33.72
You know, you're like, how did I do that?

3764
02:37:33.72 --> 02:37:35.72
I just got it on a long cranberry juice.

3765
02:37:35.72 --> 02:37:39.72
That's, that's your, that's your, that's your, that's your bottle bro.

3766
02:37:39.72 --> 02:37:41.76
You shouldn't be that's your body's way of telling you.

3767
02:37:41.76 --> 02:37:42.76
Don't want that.

3768
02:37:42.76 --> 02:37:43.76
You're right.

3769
02:37:43.76 --> 02:37:44.76
You're right.

3770
02:37:44.76 --> 02:37:45.76
Yeah.

3771
02:37:45.76 --> 02:37:46.76
Maybe you're grabbing it from here putting in the trash.

3772
02:37:46.76 --> 02:37:49.76
I'm just saying that's why though.

3773
02:37:49.76 --> 02:37:52.48
So you go deadlift, not heavy, not crazy.

3774
02:37:52.48 --> 02:37:54.28
Just like your body's like, like any lifting.

3775
02:37:54.28 --> 02:37:55.96
It's like your body just getting used to it.

3776
02:37:55.96 --> 02:37:57.76
So boom, you're used to picking stuff up.

3777
02:37:57.76 --> 02:37:58.76
I'm going to try it.

3778
02:37:58.76 --> 02:37:59.76
Do it.

3779
02:37:59.76 --> 02:38:00.76
I like it.

3780
02:38:00.76 --> 02:38:01.76
Try the kettlebells too.

3781
02:38:01.76 --> 02:38:04.60
And if you want the cool ones, and when I say cool, it's like you look at them in

3782
02:38:04.60 --> 02:38:05.60
their cool.

3783
02:38:05.60 --> 02:38:06.60
Yeah.

3784
02:38:06.60 --> 02:38:07.84
Like irrefutably cool on it.

3785
02:38:07.84 --> 02:38:08.84
That's the ones.

3786
02:38:08.84 --> 02:38:09.84
The gorilla one.

3787
02:38:09.84 --> 02:38:11.16
Actually, they do the gorilla on the first one.

3788
02:38:11.16 --> 02:38:12.48
Do the chimp one first.

3789
02:38:12.48 --> 02:38:13.48
Yeah.

3790
02:38:13.48 --> 02:38:16.20
They like, what does she about me that I'm straight to zombies?

3791
02:38:16.20 --> 02:38:17.20
Yeah.

3792
02:38:17.20 --> 02:38:18.20
We're just super strong.

3793
02:38:18.20 --> 02:38:20.60
There's a, we have the same categories.

3794
02:38:20.60 --> 02:38:21.60
Yeah.

3795
02:38:21.60 --> 02:38:22.96
And I feel what they're all called.

3796
02:38:22.96 --> 02:38:25.84
But like, when I look at the legend,

3797
02:38:25.84 --> 02:38:27.04
versus the gorilla,

3798
02:38:27.04 --> 02:38:27.56
yeah.

3799
02:38:27.56 --> 02:38:29.24
ones or the primate ones,

3800
02:38:29.24 --> 02:38:30.92
to the zombies.

3801
02:38:30.92 --> 02:38:31.04
Yeah.

3802
02:38:31.04 --> 02:38:32.68
I wanted the ones that look crazy and evil.

3803
02:38:32.68 --> 02:38:33.04
Yeah.

3804
02:38:33.04 --> 02:38:33.88
I guess that's no big shit.

3805
02:38:33.88 --> 02:38:34.48
Makes sense.

3806
02:38:34.48 --> 02:38:35.64
I had to cram points.

3807
02:38:35.64 --> 02:38:35.84
Yeah.

3808
02:38:35.84 --> 02:38:37.96
I think we both, we all hear collectively.

3809
02:38:37.96 --> 02:38:39.40
No, why you want to zombies?

3810
02:38:39.40 --> 02:38:43.84
Technically, it's so, but that brings up good point in my opinion.

3811
02:38:43.84 --> 02:38:45.20
All the different categories,

3812
02:38:45.20 --> 02:38:46.20
primal bells.

3813
02:38:46.20 --> 02:38:49.68
That's the the chimp, the, you know, all the things,

3814
02:38:49.68 --> 02:38:52.04
different zombies, all zombies, legends,

3815
02:38:52.04 --> 02:38:56.000
where wolf, uh, cyclops, cyclops, like all the legends.

3816
02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.60
So boom, pick your category, but that's the cool ones.

3817
02:38:58.60 --> 02:38:59.60
I recommend.

3818
02:38:59.60 --> 02:39:00.20
What else?

3819
02:39:00.20 --> 02:39:00.76
Check them out.

3820
02:39:00.76 --> 02:39:01.60
Hey man.

3821
02:39:01.60 --> 02:39:02.68
Jump ropes off kind of.

3822
02:39:02.68 --> 02:39:05.16
Actually, it's kind of good you go on there.

3823
02:39:05.16 --> 02:39:07.04
And they have all kinds of workout stuff.

3824
02:39:07.04 --> 02:39:09.64
Like stuff, you know how, but you know how when you get

3825
02:39:09.64 --> 02:39:11.04
into a workout, maybe not you.

3826
02:39:11.04 --> 02:39:14.52
You're not like this, but like I got into the kettle bells

3827
02:39:14.52 --> 02:39:16.68
and it became fun, you know?

3828
02:39:16.68 --> 02:39:18.56
You know how like, if something becomes fun,

3829
02:39:18.56 --> 02:39:20.32
I stop doing it, do something that sucks.

3830
02:39:20.32 --> 02:39:23.20
Well, bang this is more boring.

3831
02:39:23.20 --> 02:39:24.40
What's psychological challenge?

3832
02:39:24.40 --> 02:39:25.08
She's huge.

3833
02:39:25.08 --> 02:39:27.30
But they got all kinds of like the maces and you know

3834
02:39:27.30 --> 02:39:28.44
all the workout stuff, whatever.

3835
02:39:28.44 --> 02:39:30.48
Anyway, that's a good one on it.com slash jockel,

3836
02:39:30.48 --> 02:39:33.04
check out that stuff and man get after it.

3837
02:39:33.04 --> 02:39:34.20
Even if you're getting bored, man,

3838
02:39:34.20 --> 02:39:37.76
you got some interesting stuff to work out with.

3839
02:39:37.76 --> 02:39:38.60
I'll recommend.

3840
02:39:38.60 --> 02:39:39.12
Awesome.

3841
02:39:39.12 --> 02:39:42.64
Also, if you like these books,

3842
02:39:42.64 --> 02:39:43.92
peep didn't write a book, wait,

3843
02:39:43.92 --> 02:39:45.64
do have you written a book before?

3844
02:39:45.64 --> 02:39:48.20
No, I wouldn't be so proud of that.

3845
02:39:48.20 --> 02:39:50.44
I wrote a long ass paper.

3846
02:39:50.44 --> 02:39:51.76
Yeah.

3847
02:39:51.76 --> 02:39:54.16
Well, I couldn't sleep over the last year, but

3848
02:39:54.16 --> 02:39:55.000
yeah.

3849
02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.16
So yeah, a little bit different.

3850
02:39:57.16 --> 02:39:58.36
But anyway, a lot of times,

3851
02:39:58.36 --> 02:40:01.04
jockel will review books on this podcast.

3852
02:40:01.04 --> 02:40:02.92
People like to get them.

3853
02:40:02.92 --> 02:40:04.28
If you're one of those people out there,

3854
02:40:04.28 --> 02:40:06.40
go to the website, jockelpodcast.com,

3855
02:40:06.40 --> 02:40:08.20

02:40:08.20 --> 02:40:09.68
click through there to get the books.

3857
02:40:09.68 --> 02:40:10.88
That's a good way to support.

3858
02:40:10.88 --> 02:40:15.000
Takes you to Amazon or if you're doing any other shopping,

3859
02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:15.96
do it through there.

3860
02:40:15.96 --> 02:40:19.08
Big support, small action,

3861
02:40:19.08 --> 02:40:20.88
small action, big reaction.

3862
02:40:20.88 --> 02:40:21.68
Nice.

3863
02:40:21.68 --> 02:40:24.24
Also, subscribe to the podcast.

3864
02:40:24.24 --> 02:40:26.04
Mm.

3865
02:40:26.04 --> 02:40:27.12
Google Play.

3866
02:40:27.12 --> 02:40:29.12
We still feel the need to say that.

3867
02:40:29.12 --> 02:40:29.48
Yeah.

3868
02:40:29.48 --> 02:40:31.48
Because what?

3869
02:40:31.48 --> 02:40:33.08
Some people aren't subscribed.

3870
02:40:33.08 --> 02:40:35.88
In the event, uh, yeah, you know,

3871
02:40:35.88 --> 02:40:36.72
it's it.

3872
02:40:36.72 --> 02:40:39.64
I guess it's just our guests, my guests.

3873
02:40:39.64 --> 02:40:42.60
There's probably

3874
02:40:42.60 --> 02:40:46.48
high hypothesis speaking, this is my hypothesis.

3875
02:40:46.48 --> 02:40:48.72
What I'm saying, this is probably a marginal group,

3876
02:40:48.72 --> 02:40:50.12
who's like, eh, who's jockel?

3877
02:40:50.12 --> 02:40:52.12
I heard him on Joe Rogan or I don't know.

3878
02:40:52.12 --> 02:40:53.88
I seen him on whatever.

3879
02:40:53.88 --> 02:40:55.44
I think I'm listening to the podcast.

3880
02:40:55.44 --> 02:40:56.80
I was like, okay, cool.

3881
02:40:56.80 --> 02:40:58.52
I'm listening to a lemony listen to another one.

3882
02:40:58.52 --> 02:41:00.000
Okay, cool.

3883
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.72
Maybe I'm not down.

3884
02:41:01.72 --> 02:41:02.76
You know, he's kind of weird.

3885
02:41:02.76 --> 02:41:05.24
Or just whatever they don't understand.

3886
02:41:05.24 --> 02:41:07.96
Like, oh, I can subscribe to this.

3887
02:41:07.96 --> 02:41:09.08
Like, I can just get it.

3888
02:41:09.08 --> 02:41:10.36
It'll tell me when it's coming.

3889
02:41:10.36 --> 02:41:10.72
Right?

3890
02:41:10.72 --> 02:41:12.76
Because a lot of people don't listen to podcasts.

3891
02:41:12.76 --> 02:41:13.76
Yeah.

3892
02:41:13.76 --> 02:41:15.24
I got a question for you about that.

3893
02:41:15.24 --> 02:41:17.44
Have you thought about,

3894
02:41:17.44 --> 02:41:19.48
because you, this is number 90.

3895
02:41:19.48 --> 02:41:19.68
Yes.

3896
02:41:19.68 --> 02:41:23.12
If you thought about breaking the podcasts into categories,

3897
02:41:23.12 --> 02:41:25.48
to speak to your audience,

3898
02:41:25.48 --> 02:41:28.32
because you cover such a broad audience,

3899
02:41:28.32 --> 02:41:29.68
when you say breaking them,

3900
02:41:29.68 --> 02:41:32.12
you mean just another section like,

3901
02:41:32.12 --> 02:41:33.24
cut them up?

3902
02:41:33.24 --> 02:41:35.12
No, no, no, the full podcast.

3903
02:41:35.12 --> 02:41:37.12
But like, where your cover books,

3904
02:41:37.12 --> 02:41:38.48
where you're talking about business,

3905
02:41:38.48 --> 02:41:40.16
where you're interviewing somebody,

3906
02:41:40.16 --> 02:41:42.40
breaking them up that way.

3907
02:41:42.40 --> 02:41:43.24
Yeah, they are.

3908
02:41:43.24 --> 02:41:44.12
It's been technically,

3909
02:41:44.12 --> 02:41:45.60
because it's not a linear.

3910
02:41:45.60 --> 02:41:46.44
Right.

3911
02:41:46.44 --> 02:41:47.76
You don't have to listen from one.

3912
02:41:47.76 --> 02:41:48.60
Right.

3913
02:41:48.60 --> 02:41:50.96
I recommend, when someone says, hey,

3914
02:41:50.96 --> 02:41:53.56
you know, I just heard your podcasts.

3915
02:41:53.56 --> 02:41:54.72
Oh, I heard, I heard,

3916
02:41:54.72 --> 02:41:55.72
I just listened to that podcast.

3917
02:41:55.72 --> 02:41:56.72
You just put out.

3918
02:41:56.72 --> 02:41:58.40
I want to listen to the rest of them.

3919
02:41:58.40 --> 02:41:59.36
Should I go backwards?

3920
02:41:59.36 --> 02:42:00.20
Should I go forwards?

3921
02:42:00.20 --> 02:42:02.16
And I tell people start at one.

3922
02:42:02.16 --> 02:42:05.64
And most of the people that I talk to that are

3923
02:42:05.64 --> 02:42:07.24
into the podcast, they're like,

3924
02:42:07.24 --> 02:42:08.28
that's the right advice.

3925
02:42:08.28 --> 02:42:09.60
Tell people start at one.

3926
02:42:09.60 --> 02:42:13.56
If I said, Jockel, I want to listen to your

3927
02:42:13.56 --> 02:42:15.20
really business related podcasts.

3928
02:42:15.20 --> 02:42:15.84
Right.

3929
02:42:15.84 --> 02:42:17.24
I couldn't could I do that or no.

3930
02:42:17.24 --> 02:42:19.16
What we are going to do,

3931
02:42:19.16 --> 02:42:22.72
and I have this in the background going into something

3932
02:42:22.72 --> 02:42:24.48
that I've been trying to get down for a while is,

3933
02:42:24.48 --> 02:42:26.16
we're going to kind of archive where you're going to be

3934
02:42:26.16 --> 02:42:28.32
able to maybe figure out, oh,

3935
02:42:28.32 --> 02:42:30.08
I want to listen to business boom.

3936
02:42:30.08 --> 02:42:31.64
And here's a podcast, you know,

3937
02:42:31.64 --> 02:42:32.76
the section.

3938
02:42:32.76 --> 02:42:35.12
Now whether or not we like chop them up

3939
02:42:35.12 --> 02:42:37.36
and put them into one group,

3940
02:42:37.36 --> 02:42:39.000
not yet, not yet.

3941
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.92
Yeah, I mean, it's not organized.

3942
02:42:42.92 --> 02:42:45.08
We'll say, but it's one of those things.

3943
02:42:45.08 --> 02:42:46.48
You got to manually look, you know,

3944
02:42:46.48 --> 02:42:47.64
because it'll say what it's about.

3945
02:42:47.64 --> 02:42:50.52
In fact, the podcast, it's straight up by time stamp.

3946
02:42:50.52 --> 02:42:51.80
Yeah, it's like it's about stock.

3947
02:42:51.80 --> 02:42:52.80
It's about stock.

3948
02:42:52.80 --> 02:42:54.04
So you can kind of do it that way,

3949
02:42:54.04 --> 02:42:55.20
but no, not organized.

3950
02:42:55.20 --> 02:42:57.60
Like if you're, and it makes sense, though,

3951
02:42:57.60 --> 02:43:00.64
because if we're talking about a book and people like,

3952
02:43:00.64 --> 02:43:02.32
what love world or to love it.

3953
02:43:02.32 --> 02:43:03.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3954
02:43:03.16 --> 02:43:04.000
Boom, all right.

3955
02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Yeah, there's 10 podcasts and one more or two.

3956
02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:05.80
Yeah, yeah.

3957
02:43:05.80 --> 02:43:06.88
And they can just get after it.

3958
02:43:06.88 --> 02:43:08.36
And then maybe, you know,

3959
02:43:08.36 --> 02:43:09.20
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3960
02:43:09.20 --> 02:43:09.20
Just like, yeah, yeah.

3961
02:43:09.20 --> 02:43:10.04
Good idea.

3962
02:43:10.04 --> 02:43:11.20
Pete, I like the house.

3963
02:43:11.20 --> 02:43:12.04
Big time.

3964
02:43:12.04 --> 02:43:13.52
But yeah, subscribe.

3965
02:43:13.52 --> 02:43:14.36
That's a good one.

3966
02:43:14.36 --> 02:43:15.76
If you haven't already, how about that?

3967
02:43:15.76 --> 02:43:17.48
If you haven't already subscribed, that's a good one.

3968
02:43:17.48 --> 02:43:19.48
Also YouTube, subscribe to that one.

3969
02:43:19.48 --> 02:43:20.80
Yeah.

3970
02:43:20.80 --> 02:43:23.48
That one's a little bit more like,

3971
02:43:23.48 --> 02:43:25.60
make sense to be like, hey, subscribe to YouTube.

3972
02:43:25.60 --> 02:43:27.28
And the big thing that you might not know is

3973
02:43:27.28 --> 02:43:29.24
if you're not subscribed to YouTube,

3974
02:43:29.24 --> 02:43:31.72
there could be things that are not in the podcast.

3975
02:43:31.72 --> 02:43:32.72
Yeah.

3976
02:43:32.72 --> 02:43:33.84
So let's say you like the podcast.

3977
02:43:33.84 --> 02:43:34.68
You're listening to it.

3978
02:43:34.68 --> 02:43:36.12
And you go, yeah, I've heard all the podcasts

3979
02:43:36.12 --> 02:43:37.24
I don't need to get YouTube.

3980
02:43:37.24 --> 02:43:38.08
You're wrong.

3981
02:43:38.08 --> 02:43:43.08
Yeah, because there could be things released into the YouTube

3982
02:43:44.76 --> 02:43:46.20
that have not been released.

3983
02:43:46.20 --> 02:43:48.32
For instance, deleted scenes.

3984
02:43:48.32 --> 02:43:49.16
Deleted scenes.

3985
02:43:49.16 --> 02:43:52.16
Which is us talking off the record about things like

3986
02:43:52.16 --> 02:43:55.96
people that have certain, you know, what issues.

3987
02:43:55.96 --> 02:43:57.12
What kind of issues, right?

3988
02:43:57.12 --> 02:43:58.72
What kind of issues?

3989
02:43:58.72 --> 02:44:00.28
Nothing, bro.

3990
02:44:00.28 --> 02:44:01.68
Black of squatting issues.

3991
02:44:01.68 --> 02:44:02.68
Yeah, Rosie.

3992
02:44:02.68 --> 02:44:05.72
Yeah, and I said, I stopped squatting because of,

3993
02:44:05.72 --> 02:44:09.28
actually, the technically the story goes, I stopped squatting

3994
02:44:09.28 --> 02:44:12.80
because my wife said, hey, your legs are like real big.

3995
02:44:12.80 --> 02:44:13.92
And it looks weird.

3996
02:44:13.92 --> 02:44:15.64
That's funny because my wife said, you're starting

3997
02:44:15.64 --> 02:44:17.24
to get an old man, but.

3998
02:44:17.24 --> 02:44:18.44
Okay.

3999
02:44:18.44 --> 02:44:18.80
Cool.

4000
02:44:18.80 --> 02:44:19.44
But.

4001
02:44:19.44 --> 02:44:20.44
Yeah, cool.

4002
02:44:20.44 --> 02:44:21.72
So what is the same thing?

4003
02:44:21.72 --> 02:44:22.96
And what does it mean?

4004
02:44:22.96 --> 02:44:23.44
I don't know.

4005
02:44:23.44 --> 02:44:24.44
I don't like it.

4006
02:44:24.44 --> 02:44:25.40
I don't like it, though.

4007
02:44:25.40 --> 02:44:26.24
I don't know what it means.

4008
02:44:26.24 --> 02:44:27.24
I don't like it.

4009
02:44:27.24 --> 02:44:28.08
I'm squatting.

4010
02:44:28.08 --> 02:44:29.08
You need to get on this wall.

4011
02:44:29.08 --> 02:44:30.08
You just squatting.

4012
02:44:30.08 --> 02:44:30.92
Yeah, yeah.

4013
02:44:30.92 --> 02:44:32.60
But like kettlebell swings boom.

4014
02:44:32.60 --> 02:44:33.60
Yeah, that's what it's like.

4015
02:44:33.60 --> 02:44:34.44
That's what it's like.

4016
02:44:34.44 --> 02:44:38.20
They say that the regular or the Russian kettlebell swings

4017
02:44:38.20 --> 02:44:39.44
goes to your channel.

4018
02:44:39.44 --> 02:44:40.88
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4019
02:44:40.88 --> 02:44:44.16
Yeah, I learned that the, all that stuff.

4020
02:44:44.16 --> 02:44:45.88
Either way, yeah, the deleted scenes.

4021
02:44:45.88 --> 02:44:49.60
That's what he was giving me shit about because I stopped squatting.

4022
02:44:49.60 --> 02:44:51.08
Actually, I didn't stop squatting.

4023
02:44:51.08 --> 02:44:53.28
I stopped squatting like hardcore legs.

4024
02:44:53.28 --> 02:44:54.08
You know what I'm saying?

4025
02:44:54.08 --> 02:44:56.20
You stopped squatting.

4026
02:44:56.20 --> 02:44:59.20
The point is, is you stopped squatting.

4027
02:44:59.20 --> 02:45:00.20
Yeah, no.

4028
02:45:00.20 --> 02:45:03.32
Anyway, yeah, deleted scenes are on there.

4029
02:45:03.32 --> 02:45:05.000
Like, excerpts too, you know?

4030
02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.16
Like, let's say you were like, hey, I liked that part.

4031
02:45:07.16 --> 02:45:09.20
And people still email me about that, by the way.

4032
02:45:09.20 --> 02:45:12.28
Or they're like, hey, what was that part or what episode was that from?

4033
02:45:12.28 --> 02:45:13.56
That part where whatever.

4034
02:45:13.56 --> 02:45:19.92
So instead of having to scour, it seems like just share that excerpts easy to find.

4035
02:45:19.92 --> 02:45:22.04
So yeah, that's the going to subscribe to YouTube.

4036
02:45:22.04 --> 02:45:24.04
Also, Jocco is a store.

4037
02:45:24.04 --> 02:45:25.84
It's called JoccoStore.

4038
02:45:25.84 --> 02:45:27.16
JoccoStore.com.

4039
02:45:27.16 --> 02:45:28.68
Guess what's on there?

4040
02:45:28.68 --> 02:45:29.68
Everything.

4041
02:45:29.68 --> 02:45:33.28
Potentially everything.

4042
02:45:33.28 --> 02:45:36.80
But as of right now, there's some shirts on there.

4043
02:45:36.80 --> 02:45:39.16
Women's stuff on there, patches on there.

4044
02:45:39.16 --> 02:45:42.64
You know, you put them on your hat interchangeable Velcro patches.

4045
02:45:42.64 --> 02:45:43.96
If you will.

4046
02:45:43.96 --> 02:45:44.96
Rash guards.

4047
02:45:44.96 --> 02:45:45.96
Awesome.

4048
02:45:45.96 --> 02:45:49.36
So now they have two options, huh?

4049
02:45:49.36 --> 02:45:53.24
JoccoRashguards get after it through through per darkness,

4050
02:45:53.24 --> 02:45:55.36
rashguards and origin rashguards.

4051
02:45:55.36 --> 02:45:56.36
Yeah.

4052
02:45:56.36 --> 02:45:57.96
Just like that, the selection just passed by.

4053
02:45:57.96 --> 02:45:58.96
Right.

4054
02:45:58.96 --> 02:46:03.24
And eventually, they're going to be, and this will be, will it all be?

4055
02:46:03.24 --> 02:46:04.24
Kind of melt together.

4056
02:46:04.24 --> 02:46:05.24
There we go.

4057
02:46:05.24 --> 02:46:08.68
There's one big vast, uh, just in place to just go in.

4058
02:46:08.68 --> 02:46:12.40
This place is going to be a melting pot of awesomeness.

4059
02:46:12.40 --> 02:46:13.40
Right.

4060
02:46:13.40 --> 02:46:14.40
Yeah, it's indeed.

4061
02:46:14.40 --> 02:46:15.40
Yeah.

4062
02:46:15.40 --> 02:46:16.40
But yeah.

4063
02:46:16.40 --> 02:46:17.40
Yeah.

4064
02:46:17.40 --> 02:46:18.40
All that.

4065
02:46:18.40 --> 02:46:20.84
So, and some hoodies on there.

4066
02:46:20.84 --> 02:46:21.84
Yeah.

4067
02:46:21.84 --> 02:46:23.12
I think we should consult.

4068
02:46:23.12 --> 02:46:25.28
No, he, I'm going to tell you.

4069
02:46:25.28 --> 02:46:27.28
I already know what he's going to say.

4070
02:46:27.28 --> 02:46:28.28
He's from Hawaii.

4071
02:46:28.28 --> 02:46:29.68
What do you want to lie away hoodie?

4072
02:46:29.68 --> 02:46:31.56
No, he, so he made hoodies.

4073
02:46:31.56 --> 02:46:32.56
And I'm from New England.

4074
02:46:32.56 --> 02:46:36.12
And so I was like, oh, you make a hoodie, you can wear it in like a full-fledged, artich store.

4075
02:46:36.12 --> 02:46:38.60
I mean, you'd better have a heavyweight gun hoodie.

4076
02:46:38.60 --> 02:46:41.52
So his, his, his, our, our, our light.

4077
02:46:41.52 --> 02:46:42.80
They're for their cool for so cow.

4078
02:46:42.80 --> 02:46:43.80
Yeah.

4079
02:46:43.80 --> 02:46:44.80
They're good for Hawaii.

4080
02:46:44.80 --> 02:46:45.80
If you even have hoodies in Hawaii.

4081
02:46:45.80 --> 02:46:47.56
They're like a fall hoodie, I guess.

4082
02:46:47.56 --> 02:46:49.28
And even that's like my guess.

4083
02:46:49.28 --> 02:46:50.28
I don't know.

4084
02:46:50.28 --> 02:46:55.12
That's why I'm saying we should, cause I mean, his is like his consultation things when

4085
02:46:55.12 --> 02:46:56.12
I consult him.

4086
02:46:56.12 --> 02:46:58.92
Like, hey, it's, it's like mixed in with a scolding.

4087
02:46:58.92 --> 02:47:00.88
So, you know, I get the scolding first thing.

4088
02:47:00.88 --> 02:47:03.44
I think I'm going to feel like maybe he's still doing it.

4089
02:47:03.44 --> 02:47:08.72
I want to make a really, really badass flatlocked hoodie.

4090
02:47:08.72 --> 02:47:09.72
What's to do it?

4091
02:47:09.72 --> 02:47:10.72
What is a flatlocked hoodie?

4092
02:47:10.72 --> 02:47:11.72
What is that?

4093
02:47:11.72 --> 02:47:12.72
Wait a sec.

4094
02:47:12.72 --> 02:47:13.72
Flat seemed hoodie.

4095
02:47:13.72 --> 02:47:14.72
How could we possibly do that?

4096
02:47:14.72 --> 02:47:18.28
What are we going to get someone to know how to make flatlocked, awesome badass hoodies?

4097
02:47:18.28 --> 02:47:19.28
Oh, wait.

4098
02:47:19.28 --> 02:47:21.28
We're sitting in a factory.

4099
02:47:21.28 --> 02:47:22.28
That's right.

4100
02:47:22.28 --> 02:47:23.28
We're awesome.

4101
02:47:23.28 --> 02:47:24.28
Get me get it.

4102
02:47:24.28 --> 02:47:25.28
I think we're gonna get it.

4103
02:47:25.28 --> 02:47:26.28
We're gonna get it.

4104
02:47:26.28 --> 02:47:27.28
We're gonna get it.

4105
02:47:27.28 --> 02:47:28.28
That's good stuff.

4106
02:47:28.28 --> 02:47:29.28
Also.

4107
02:47:29.28 --> 02:47:30.68
Psychological warfare.

4108
02:47:30.68 --> 02:47:36.28
Previously, a few minutes ago, we talked about joint warfare for joint.

4109
02:47:36.28 --> 02:47:37.28
Yeah.

4110
02:47:37.28 --> 02:47:38.28
Degeneration.

4111
02:47:38.28 --> 02:47:39.28
Insumption.

4112
02:47:39.28 --> 02:47:40.28
All that stuff.

4113
02:47:40.28 --> 02:47:41.28
Overall, real generalization.

4114
02:47:41.28 --> 02:47:43.28
Supplementation for your body.

4115
02:47:43.28 --> 02:47:44.28
Yeah.

4116
02:47:44.28 --> 02:47:46.28
Sometimes you need supplementation for your mind.

4117
02:47:46.28 --> 02:47:47.28
For your mind, yes.

4118
02:47:47.28 --> 02:47:52.28
So in your campaign, against weakness, psychological weakness, you know, you're trying

4119
02:47:52.28 --> 02:47:53.28
to get up every day.

4120
02:47:53.28 --> 02:47:54.28
Right.

4121
02:47:54.28 --> 02:47:55.28
Stay to the diet.

4122
02:47:55.28 --> 02:47:58.28
Can that help me with eating multiple.

4123
02:47:58.28 --> 02:47:59.28
Yeah.

4124
02:47:59.28 --> 02:48:00.28
Multiple will be pies.

4125
02:48:00.28 --> 02:48:01.28
Yes.

4126
02:48:01.28 --> 02:48:02.28
Yes.

4127
02:48:02.28 --> 02:48:03.28
Actually, there's an specific.

4128
02:48:03.28 --> 02:48:04.28
Yeah, for this.

4129
02:48:04.28 --> 02:48:09.28
You know, I'm definitely interested in that because that's been my one struggle as a human.

4130
02:48:09.28 --> 02:48:10.28
What is a will be pie?

4131
02:48:10.28 --> 02:48:15.28
A will be pie is like cake in with cream, right?

4132
02:48:15.28 --> 02:48:16.28
Yes.

4133
02:48:16.28 --> 02:48:19.28
I saw like a fig Newton commercial because it's a fig Newton.

4134
02:48:19.28 --> 02:48:23.28
Yeah, fig Newton is like if you put those two next to each other, they're in different

4135
02:48:23.28 --> 02:48:24.28
planets.

4136
02:48:24.28 --> 02:48:25.28
Exactly.

4137
02:48:25.28 --> 02:48:26.28
I see.

4138
02:48:26.28 --> 02:48:30.28
Well, allegedly, I think just a big giant blocks of sugar.

4139
02:48:30.28 --> 02:48:34.28
Which is pretty much what I love the bias, which is why my home, me over here.

4140
02:48:34.28 --> 02:48:35.28
Yeah.

4141
02:48:35.28 --> 02:48:36.28
You have to keep it up.

4142
02:48:36.28 --> 02:48:38.28
I have single parent family for kids.

4143
02:48:38.28 --> 02:48:40.28
We're fighting over the food in the house, too.

4144
02:48:40.28 --> 02:48:41.28
I've never broken out of that.

4145
02:48:41.28 --> 02:48:42.28
And we'll be fine.

4146
02:48:42.28 --> 02:48:43.28
We need to break the milk.

4147
02:48:43.28 --> 02:48:44.28
We can weaken more.

4148
02:48:44.28 --> 02:48:48.28
We can introduce you to a track called Sugar Coded Lies.

4149
02:48:48.28 --> 02:48:49.28
Really?

4150
02:48:49.28 --> 02:48:50.28
Yeah.

4151
02:48:50.28 --> 02:48:51.28
Yeah.

4152
02:48:51.28 --> 02:48:52.28
I'd be very interested.

4153
02:48:52.28 --> 02:48:54.28
We'll get you on the sugar because it's nice.

4154
02:48:54.28 --> 02:48:55.28
Yeah.

4155
02:48:55.28 --> 02:48:58.28
And you'd think it'd be like, juggle yelling at you.

4156
02:48:58.28 --> 02:49:03.28
Don't whatever, but it's a pragmatic explanation of what your mind is doing right now.

4157
02:49:03.28 --> 02:49:06.28
And what it shouldn't be doing and what it should be doing.

4158
02:49:06.28 --> 02:49:07.28
And you'd be like, oh, okay.

4159
02:49:07.28 --> 02:49:09.28
And psychological warfare that can help.

4160
02:49:09.28 --> 02:49:10.28
Yes.

4161
02:49:10.28 --> 02:49:11.28
Oh, big time.

4162
02:49:11.28 --> 02:49:13.28
Basically, it's like, you mentioned that it's an album.

4163
02:49:13.28 --> 02:49:14.28
It's an, oh, yeah.

4164
02:49:14.28 --> 02:49:16.28
It's an album with tracks.

4165
02:49:16.28 --> 02:49:17.28
On iTunes.

4166
02:49:17.28 --> 02:49:18.28
Jockel tracks.

4167
02:49:18.28 --> 02:49:21.28
I tune Amazon music, like all these things.

4168
02:49:21.28 --> 02:49:22.28
Yeah.

4169
02:49:22.28 --> 02:49:27.28
And you know what, you, you probably sent here thinking, like, okay, that's a neat little idea that,

4170
02:49:27.28 --> 02:49:31.28
you know, echo came up with and made Jockel do this and Uncle.

4171
02:49:31.28 --> 02:49:33.28
That album.

4172
02:49:33.28 --> 02:49:37.28
Number one spoken word album on iTunes.

4173
02:49:37.28 --> 02:49:38.28
Four?

4174
02:49:38.28 --> 02:49:39.28
I don't know.

4175
02:49:39.28 --> 02:49:42.28
I lost like, like, 38 straight weeks.

4176
02:49:42.28 --> 02:49:43.28
You kidding.

4177
02:49:43.28 --> 02:49:44.28
Number one.

4178
02:49:44.28 --> 02:49:45.28
Yeah.

4179
02:49:45.28 --> 02:49:46.28
Bad ass.

4180
02:49:46.28 --> 02:49:47.28
No big deal.

4181
02:49:47.28 --> 02:49:48.28
Yeah.

4182
02:49:48.28 --> 02:49:49.28
I don't know.

4183
02:49:49.28 --> 02:49:54.28
Say that when echo's like, dude, you just kind of, you know, just, just, you know, these things that I'm asking you about.

4184
02:49:54.28 --> 02:49:57.28
You kind of just like, you know, hammer it and I'll just record it.

4185
02:49:57.28 --> 02:49:57.28
Yeah.

4186
02:49:57.28 --> 02:49:57.28
Yeah.

4187
02:49:57.28 --> 02:49:58.28
It's basically like, okay.

4188
02:49:58.28 --> 02:50:00.28
So I used to have this thing.

4189
02:50:00.28 --> 02:50:02.28
You do not need more of this thing.

4190
02:50:02.28 --> 02:50:04.28
Where you know when you're like, okay, I'm working out this day.

4191
02:50:04.28 --> 02:50:05.28
This is, you know, I'm just doing this day.

4192
02:50:05.28 --> 02:50:10.28
And when it comes time to work out and I've a gym at my house now.

4193
02:50:10.28 --> 02:50:12.28
So I'm like, oh, maybe I'll do it.

4194
02:50:12.28 --> 02:50:13.28
I meant to do it at noon.

4195
02:50:13.28 --> 02:50:14.28
I'm into it tonight.

4196
02:50:14.28 --> 02:50:15.28
I don't feel like doing it around.

4197
02:50:15.28 --> 02:50:16.28
I'm doing it tonight.

4198
02:50:16.28 --> 02:50:18.28
And then you know accountability.

4199
02:50:18.28 --> 02:50:19.28
Yeah.

4200
02:50:19.28 --> 02:50:20.28
Nobody's watching.

4201
02:50:20.28 --> 02:50:21.28
Yeah.

4202
02:50:21.28 --> 02:50:22.28
You can do it.

4203
02:50:22.28 --> 02:50:22.28
Yeah.

4204
02:50:22.28 --> 02:50:24.28
When I feel like a little bit marching some coffee, whatever.

4205
02:50:24.28 --> 02:50:26.28
It's right outside, you know, kind of.

4206
02:50:26.28 --> 02:50:27.28
I totally get it.

4207
02:50:27.28 --> 02:50:28.28
Yeah.

4208
02:50:28.28 --> 02:50:30.28
And that night turns into hell, do it tomorrow.

4209
02:50:30.28 --> 02:50:33.28
So you basically turn a workout day into a rest day.

4210
02:50:33.28 --> 02:50:36.28
And this helps you turn on your motivation again.

4211
02:50:36.28 --> 02:50:37.28
Yeah.

4212
02:50:37.28 --> 02:50:38.28
And it's again.

4213
02:50:38.28 --> 02:50:40.28
It's not like a motivational thing.

4214
02:50:40.28 --> 02:50:41.28
It's like, okay.

4215
02:50:41.28 --> 02:50:43.28
This is, it's joccal saying it.

4216
02:50:43.28 --> 02:50:44.28
So okay.

4217
02:50:44.28 --> 02:50:45.28
There's that.

4218
02:50:45.28 --> 02:50:46.28
But it's like, it's saying, okay.

4219
02:50:46.28 --> 02:50:47.28
This is what's going on.

4220
02:50:47.28 --> 02:50:48.28
What's your thinking right now?

4221
02:50:48.28 --> 02:50:50.28
This is what you shouldn't be thinking right now.

4222
02:50:50.28 --> 02:50:51.28
This is what you should be thinking right now.

4223
02:50:51.28 --> 02:50:52.28
Okay.

4224
02:50:52.28 --> 02:50:53.28
There you go.

4225
02:50:53.28 --> 02:50:54.28
Go.

4226
02:50:54.28 --> 02:50:57.28
It's in your like, the thing that I find about him is because it is me talking.

4227
02:50:57.28 --> 02:50:58.28
Yeah.

4228
02:50:58.28 --> 02:50:59.28
I find it.

4229
02:50:59.28 --> 02:51:03.28
They're, they're very, um, very tight arguments.

4230
02:51:03.28 --> 02:51:04.28
Yeah.

4231
02:51:04.28 --> 02:51:05.28
Yeah.

4232
02:51:05.28 --> 02:51:06.28
You know get done listening and you go.

4233
02:51:06.28 --> 02:51:07.28
You know what?

4234
02:51:07.28 --> 02:51:09.28
I still find a little hole in his argument.

4235
02:51:09.28 --> 02:51:11.28
You know, I think this one sugar code is one will be buys it.

4236
02:51:11.28 --> 02:51:12.28
Not going to be happy.

4237
02:51:12.28 --> 02:51:13.28
No.

4238
02:51:13.28 --> 02:51:14.28
You're like, you know what?

4239
02:51:14.28 --> 02:51:15.28
This is a big deal.

4240
02:51:15.28 --> 02:51:16.28
Yeah.

4241
02:51:16.28 --> 02:51:18.28
You know, you might be the ultimate test case.

4242
02:51:18.28 --> 02:51:19.28
Yeah.

4243
02:51:19.28 --> 02:51:20.28
I will be the ultimate.

4244
02:51:20.28 --> 02:51:21.28
I don't care.

4245
02:51:21.28 --> 02:51:23.28
I don't care who's around me.

4246
02:51:23.28 --> 02:51:25.28
Ben, if like, I get that craving for sugar.

4247
02:51:25.28 --> 02:51:27.28
We would travel in the other day.

4248
02:51:27.28 --> 02:51:28.28
What I get?

4249
02:51:28.28 --> 02:51:29.28
Sweet tea.

4250
02:51:29.28 --> 02:51:30.28
Oh, dang.

4251
02:51:30.28 --> 02:51:32.28
Why sugar sugar.

4252
02:51:32.28 --> 02:51:33.28
Sugar.

4253
02:51:33.28 --> 02:51:34.28
But keep it in mind.

4254
02:51:34.28 --> 02:51:37.28
I'm going to ruin you.

4255
02:51:37.28 --> 02:51:38.28
No, your mom is.

4256
02:51:38.28 --> 02:51:39.28
I know.

4257
02:51:39.28 --> 02:51:40.28
I can't.

4258
02:51:40.28 --> 02:51:41.28
Yeah.

4259
02:51:41.28 --> 02:51:43.28
She's like, you know, you're like, hey, you want to try these things.

4260
02:51:43.28 --> 02:51:46.28
I know what it is.

4261
02:51:46.28 --> 02:51:48.28
And you said, man, you've got to try this buckle on my mom's.

4262
02:51:48.28 --> 02:51:49.28
I don't know.

4263
02:51:49.28 --> 02:51:50.28
I know it's sweet, right?

4264
02:51:50.28 --> 02:51:51.28
And you go like, yeah, it is.

4265
02:51:51.28 --> 02:51:52.28
I go like this.

4266
02:51:52.28 --> 02:51:54.28
You've had Spartan buckle.

4267
02:51:54.28 --> 02:51:56.28
Yeah, I was like, you know, you know, no, we deal.

4268
02:51:56.28 --> 02:52:00.28
And, you know, we've been lately been saying, like, you know, the discipline won't allow it.

4269
02:52:00.28 --> 02:52:01.28
That's true.

4270
02:52:01.28 --> 02:52:01.28
Yeah.

4271
02:52:01.28 --> 02:52:02.28
That's the new between the people.

4272
02:52:02.28 --> 02:52:06.28
You know, when we, you know, maybe see each other, maybe taking a prayer that we shouldn't be taking.

4273
02:52:06.28 --> 02:52:09.28
And we're going off the path and on to the path of weakness.

4274
02:52:09.28 --> 02:52:12.28
You know, I might be like, hey, I go, you know, that's cool and everything.

4275
02:52:12.28 --> 02:52:14.28
The discipline won't allow that.

4276
02:52:14.28 --> 02:52:15.28
Oh, man.

4277
02:52:15.28 --> 02:52:16.28
So that's awesome.

4278
02:52:16.28 --> 02:52:23.28
You know, yesterday, you know, you're dangling this custom homemade buckle of a and my mom's there.

4279
02:52:23.28 --> 02:52:24.28
And your mom's there.

4280
02:52:24.28 --> 02:52:27.28
Actually, like, and I know, I can see her.

4281
02:52:27.28 --> 02:52:32.28
She looks like she arrived from Greece three days ago to make the buckle of a.

4282
02:52:32.28 --> 02:52:36.28
You know, like, okay, I'll have one, right?

4283
02:52:36.28 --> 02:52:38.28
So I had one yesterday.

4284
02:52:38.28 --> 02:52:40.28
And then the discipline went an allowing more.

4285
02:52:40.28 --> 02:52:42.28
Today, I had nine of them.

4286
02:52:42.28 --> 02:52:46.28
I had three of them.

4287
02:52:46.28 --> 02:52:47.28
I had three of them.

4288
02:52:47.28 --> 02:52:49.28
Sugar coated lies, uh, buckle of a.

4289
02:52:49.28 --> 02:52:50.28
Yeah.

4290
02:52:50.28 --> 02:52:52.28
My mom was going to get called to make buckle of a.

4291
02:52:52.28 --> 02:52:53.28
Yeah.

4292
02:52:53.28 --> 02:52:55.28
We're just going to put the original buckle of a person.

4293
02:52:55.28 --> 02:52:57.28
We got the maple syrup.

4294
02:52:57.28 --> 02:52:58.28
Yeah.

4295
02:52:58.28 --> 02:53:03.28
But yeah, but keep in mind, though, with these tracks, you got to be on that path though.

4296
02:53:03.28 --> 02:53:05.28
It's not like you're like, hey, I eat too much.

4297
02:53:05.28 --> 02:53:06.28
Let me listen to this track.

4298
02:53:06.28 --> 02:53:07.28
It's not that.

4299
02:53:07.28 --> 02:53:09.28
It's like, okay, my plan is to straight up clean up my whole shit.

4300
02:53:09.28 --> 02:53:12.28
Like, my plan is to say, you've already found a bit of motivation.

4301
02:53:12.28 --> 02:53:13.28
Yes, you're motivated.

4302
02:53:13.28 --> 02:53:14.28
You're on the path.

4303
02:53:14.28 --> 02:53:18.28
But it's on the weakness moments, the moment we.

4304
02:53:18.28 --> 02:53:20.28
We can see like, okay, I'm going to rest today.

4305
02:53:20.28 --> 02:53:21.28
I'm going to, you know, whatever.

4306
02:53:21.28 --> 02:53:22.28
Is that kind of, yeah?

4307
02:53:22.28 --> 02:53:23.28
I do that.

4308
02:53:23.28 --> 02:53:24.28
I do that.

4309
02:53:24.28 --> 02:53:25.28
I do.

4310
02:53:25.28 --> 02:53:26.28
We all do.

4311
02:53:26.28 --> 02:53:26.28
We all do.

4312
02:53:26.28 --> 02:53:29.28
That's, that's probably why a lot of people get that album.

4313
02:53:29.28 --> 02:53:30.28
Yeah.

4314
02:53:30.28 --> 02:53:31.28
With tracks.

4315
02:53:31.28 --> 02:53:32.28
You know what I do?

4316
02:53:32.28 --> 02:53:34.28
I'm like, you're actually not used to do.

4317
02:53:34.28 --> 02:53:36.28
No, no, what I would do is this.

4318
02:53:36.28 --> 02:53:38.28
I'd be like, especially when I was training for competition.

4319
02:53:38.28 --> 02:53:41.28
I'm going to eat this will be pie.

4320
02:53:41.28 --> 02:53:44.28
I would eat it and I would run two miles.

4321
02:53:44.28 --> 02:53:45.28
Yeah.

4322
02:53:45.28 --> 02:53:46.28
I was just, you've earned it.

4323
02:53:46.28 --> 02:53:47.28
Freaking right.

4324
02:53:47.28 --> 02:53:48.28
Yeah.

4325
02:53:48.28 --> 02:53:49.28
You're in it.

4326
02:53:49.28 --> 02:53:50.28
Freaking right.

4327
02:53:50.28 --> 02:53:51.28
I do that, too.

4328
02:53:51.28 --> 02:53:52.28
Like, like, it.

4329
02:53:52.28 --> 02:53:55.28
And it's like, I try and preempt weakness with hardcore exercise.

4330
02:53:55.28 --> 02:53:56.28
Yeah, you pay attention.

4331
02:53:56.28 --> 02:53:58.28
Which by the way, often mitigates.

4332
02:53:58.28 --> 02:54:01.28
Yeah, it takes like, like, oh, I want to have a mint chocolate chip milkshake.

4333
02:54:01.28 --> 02:54:02.28
Cool.

4334
02:54:02.28 --> 02:54:06.28
I can have a mint chocolate chip milkshake as soon as I do 30 clean and jerks.

4335
02:54:06.28 --> 02:54:07.28
Okay.

4336
02:54:07.28 --> 02:54:08.28
And that I can do that.

4337
02:54:08.28 --> 02:54:10.28
And that's cool.

4338
02:54:10.28 --> 02:54:14.28
But then, but the time you get done, you're like, you know what I want that thing.

4339
02:54:14.28 --> 02:54:18.28
I infused my brain with discipline from the bar.

4340
02:54:18.28 --> 02:54:21.28
It went from the bar into my hands and into my brain.

4341
02:54:21.28 --> 02:54:22.28
Yeah.

4342
02:54:22.28 --> 02:54:23.28
That's how I don't worry.

4343
02:54:23.28 --> 02:54:24.28
Yeah.

4344
02:54:24.28 --> 02:54:25.28
In the simplest one is buries.

4345
02:54:25.28 --> 02:54:26.28
Yeah.

4346
02:54:26.28 --> 02:54:27.28
Burpees.

4347
02:54:27.28 --> 02:54:28.28
Like, okay.

4348
02:54:28.28 --> 02:54:29.28
You know what?

4349
02:54:29.28 --> 02:54:30.28
I can have this if I do a hundred burpees.

4350
02:54:30.28 --> 02:54:33.28
That takes less than 10 minutes.

4351
02:54:33.28 --> 02:54:36.28
We had this thing the other day and I talked about it.

4352
02:54:36.28 --> 02:54:37.28
I was like, oh, I know it's all the way up there.

4353
02:54:37.28 --> 02:54:40.28
And I said, I've got one of lazy loser.

4354
02:54:40.28 --> 02:54:42.28
You don't even deserve ice cream.

4355
02:54:42.28 --> 02:54:43.28
I didn't have it.

4356
02:54:43.28 --> 02:54:44.28
Yeah.

4357
02:54:44.28 --> 02:54:45.28
Because I said, you're a pathetic.

4358
02:54:45.28 --> 02:54:47.28
If you're actually questioning whether it's worth it.

4359
02:54:47.28 --> 02:54:49.28
God, I'm not going to be like, you don't need this at all.

4360
02:54:49.28 --> 02:54:50.28
And anyway, shape or form.

4361
02:54:50.28 --> 02:54:53.28
If you were thinking it wasn't worth 27 steps to get to the RV, grab the mint

4362
02:54:53.28 --> 02:54:54.28
chocolate chip.

4363
02:54:54.28 --> 02:54:55.28
Briler's ice cream.

4364
02:54:55.28 --> 02:54:56.28
I think it's a good idea.

4365
02:54:56.28 --> 02:54:57.28
I think it's a good idea.

4366
02:54:57.28 --> 02:54:58.28
I think it's a good idea.

4367
02:54:58.28 --> 02:54:59.28
I think it's a good idea.

4368
02:54:59.28 --> 02:55:00.28
I think it's a good idea.

4369
02:55:00.28 --> 02:55:01.28
I think it's a good idea.

4370
02:55:01.28 --> 02:55:02.28
I think it's a good idea.

4371
02:55:02.28 --> 02:55:03.28
I think it's a good idea.

4372
02:55:03.28 --> 02:55:06.28
But there are secret objects.

4373
02:55:06.28 --> 02:55:07.28
There aren't objects hidden in steps to get to the RV.

4374
02:55:07.28 --> 02:55:09.28
Grab the mint chocolate chip.

4375
02:55:09.28 --> 02:55:12.28
Briler's ice cream.

4376
02:55:12.28 --> 02:55:12.28
Bring it back down.

4377
02:55:12.28 --> 02:55:13.28
Scoop it into it.

4378
02:55:13.28 --> 02:55:15.28
Letting melt a little bit.

4379
02:55:15.28 --> 02:55:17.28
Just sit there and get after it.

4380
02:55:17.28 --> 02:55:19.28
Not best.

4381
02:55:19.28 --> 02:55:20.28
That's so good.

4382
02:55:20.28 --> 02:55:22.28
You'd like a little melt to the ice cream.

4383
02:55:22.28 --> 02:55:25.28
Just a little melt.

4384
02:55:25.28 --> 02:55:26.28
You like it, insolence.

4385
02:55:26.28 --> 02:55:27.28
It's here.

4386
02:55:27.28 --> 02:55:28.28
It kind of.

4387
02:55:28.28 --> 02:55:31.28
It's, you basically take ice cream.

4388
02:55:31.28 --> 02:55:36.56
And you put milking it and you start around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I do

4389
02:55:36.56 --> 02:55:37.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

4390
02:55:38.56 --> 02:55:44.12
Let's let's all be tattooing now and consider what we're talking about right now the pleasures of gains bull

4391
02:55:44.68 --> 02:55:47.28
The problem is chocolate chip ice cream

4392
02:55:47.28 --> 02:55:51.08
I would walk barefoot and two feet of snow to that friggin RV

4393
02:55:52.08 --> 02:55:54.20
Yeah, that's like this guy no he was that

4394
02:55:54.20 --> 02:56:00.48
I know my compliment that are does that negative repository? No yours is worse. It's weird because you have a better result

4395
02:56:00.48 --> 02:56:04.86
But your disc or your worn path is worth because he was like hey, I'm gonna be weak

4396
02:56:04.86 --> 02:56:09.12
I have this one that you know weak to be weak. Yeah, that was him that day

4397
02:56:09.36 --> 02:56:16.10
Yeah, but you could that's rationalize because the end you know the means and the end yeah situation thing is I actually embarrassed myself

4398
02:56:16.10 --> 02:56:23.64
Yeah, yeah, that's what it was I just he made myself and I said I can't believe I'm even questioning the fact if I would take 27 steps to my

4399
02:56:23.64 --> 02:56:29.72
Orbent the ice cream the fact that I'm even thinking that way. I don't you don't I should I should he's myself

4400
02:56:30.12 --> 02:56:36.36
Right, this is ridiculous and pathetic and just stop and so yeah, I didn't get the ice cream that night

4401
02:56:36.36 --> 02:56:42.88
But the mint chocolate chip ice cream first year is is a real thing and it's even

4402
02:56:43.40 --> 02:56:49.80
It's my favorite flavor. Yeah, yeah, I don't even know the introduction is my flavors although when I wasn't Montana

4403
02:56:49.80 --> 02:56:55.52
Ustrax lose tracks in most tracks. Yes, lose tracks. That's the other that's the other. Okay

4404
02:56:55.52 --> 02:57:01.04
I'm not gonna you know I understand and I saw it and I dig it, but it's just it's very surprising

4405
02:57:01.04 --> 02:57:10.64
You talk you can you can close the moves track with a scoop of mint chocolate chip. I've never done that that sounds deranged

4406
02:57:10.64 --> 02:57:12.64
It's like it would

4407
02:57:12.64 --> 02:57:14.64
She's she's in wine

4408
02:57:15.92 --> 02:57:17.28
She's

4409
02:57:17.28 --> 02:57:21.92
Just close it's just a fish in touch is that what she do is that what she did now?

4410
02:57:21.92 --> 02:57:25.88
I want to my buddies in the in the trees

4411
02:57:26.52 --> 02:57:29.44
Is it is a awesome guy badass wrestler

4412
02:57:30.24 --> 02:57:34.68
Result was a champion wrestler in college and was on the Olympic team

4413
02:57:35.40 --> 02:57:37.92
Didn't compete for variety reasons that I won't talk about

4414
02:57:38.52 --> 02:57:42.96
But he was friends with Dan Sever you remember Danny. Oh, yeah, yeah early US and so

4415
02:57:42.96 --> 02:57:48.32
So and so I don't know why this just came to my mind. Oh, I know why did so he would say

4416
02:57:48.64 --> 02:57:50.64
They knew each other they were friends and

4417
02:57:51.04 --> 02:57:54.60
Whenever he'd see Danny Severn Danny Severn was a heavyweight and

4418
02:57:55.60 --> 02:57:59.26
This buddy mine was cutting weight, you know, but he was a big guy. He was like whatever

4419
02:57:59.26 --> 02:58:05.66
Like 200 pounds being a cut to 190 whatever and he would call Dan Severn a pop liquor

4420
02:58:06.36 --> 02:58:09.50
Meaning like you're you're just your guy that's over there

4421
02:58:09.50 --> 02:58:15.08
You're eating everything and when you get done eating you're licking the pot right and picture you with the smile

4422
02:58:15.08 --> 02:58:17.78
You got a straight up on liquor

4423
02:58:17.78 --> 02:58:22.84
You get to the end of that bowl. You're like oh, I'm getting the rest of this mid-Jogg. My

4424
02:58:22.84 --> 02:58:30.58
sprievers getting into my belly now my my my kids have followed the path of my wife

4425
02:58:30.58 --> 02:58:41.04
And they'll come up to me when I'm eating junk food and they'll be like dad you got moops

4426
02:58:41.04 --> 02:58:43.98
You don't need that oh, they're brutal

4427
02:58:45.26 --> 02:58:50.12
A lot of poor first situation. Yeah, it is. I'm surprised you're not something like a 84 pounds

4428
02:58:50.12 --> 02:58:53.22
I should be yeah, yeah, yeah, it's scarred

4429
02:58:53.22 --> 02:58:58.34
And to me actually what would we say that's the freedom part but the thing is you got to be on the path

4430
02:58:58.34 --> 02:59:03.60
Right, so like yes, you know how they discipline equals freedom right so you know you grab the ice cream

4431
02:59:03.86 --> 02:59:10.94
Yeah, yeah, I had to pull that one yeah for the first time. I was at a I was at a little like family get together

4432
02:59:10.94 --> 02:59:15.22

02:59:15.22 --> 02:59:16.90
And there was a grandmother there

4434
02:59:17.06 --> 02:59:19.74
So a grandmother from these kids I had a birthday party blah blah blah

So and she's a German woman and you know

4436
02:59:23.76 --> 02:59:29.48
She kind of knows what's going on a little bit with the game with what's going on with everything and so I'm sitting there indeed

4437
02:59:29.48 --> 02:59:31.48
There's like a

02:59:31.48 --> 02:59:34.64

4449
03:00:17.22 --> 03:00:25.98
And she called me out and I looked at her and I said you know what I have the discipline and that allows me to have freedom sometimes to

03:00:27.46 --> 03:00:31.18
Mint chocolate chip ice cream cakes, which I'm about to do. Thank you

4451
03:00:33.42 --> 03:00:37.28
That's what you say this is the freedom part, but like I said you gotta be on the path

4452
03:00:37.28 --> 03:00:40.34
We gotta be in the game. You can't just be like this is the freedom part every single day

4453
03:00:40.98 --> 03:00:42.98
No, doesn't work that way

4454
03:00:42.98 --> 03:00:49.28
Also, jocquay T you can get that you know what it does if you're gonna start dead lifting again

03:01:34.54 --> 03:01:39.78
Yeah, that a kid who who doesn't have a path most kids don't have a path

4465
03:01:39.78 --> 03:01:46.90
The book will give them the path and the path leads them to being stronger smarter and better

4466
03:01:47.90 --> 03:01:51.82
So my daughter read it. She loved it that is awesome and she is

4533
03:06:40.76 --> 03:06:46.44
Is incredible and what's what's cool is it's like when when a when a space shuttle takes off

4534
03:06:46.92 --> 03:06:52.60
The hardest part of the journey is that first part getting breaking away from gravity of Earth and

4535
03:06:52.76 --> 03:06:57.24
What you've already done you've cleared the gravity of Earth and now you're on track and it's it's
