00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel podcast number 336 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So we've done a lot of reading and discussions and interviews on this podcast about the strategies and tactics from leadership, from human nature,

3
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that I've seen or I've seen others use or I've used myself.

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And you know, this is something that I've noticed lately is, and this is something I used to see in the sea of things.

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And now I see it at that song, in front as well. Where I can sit there and discuss something with someone,

6
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and think that they understand how to utilize that lesson immediately.

7
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So I explain something to someone and I think, oh, okay cool, you know, they get it now, right?

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And they'll nodding their head and they'll kind of even give me the readback of, you know, what the, what the principle means.

9
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And so I think they get it and it seems pretty obvious from my vantage point, but, but it isn't always that obvious to everybody.

10
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And it can be very hard to see things when you're observing them for the first time.

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So a lot of times I like to try and show a tactic or a technique or a strategy or a procedure from a different angle from a different perspective.

12
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And that's, you know, in order to try and convey that message to someone from a different vantage point where they may be can understand it better.

13
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And I think I have become biased toward giving someone else's perspective. Someone else's example.

14
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And I think that bias comes from the fact that I already know my perspective.

15
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Right? So I already know what I think, so I enjoy, or I want to give someone else's perspective of a strategy because I find it easier to do it.

16
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I find it interesting because it's someone else's, because I already know what's inside my own head, right? I already know what's in there.

17
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That being said, when I did the first interview I ever did in my life, what's with Tim Peris, and he asked me if there's anything that I was world class at.

18
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And of course I said world classes are very strong.

19
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Fraze to you, right? And he said it is a strong phrase. And I, so I told him I didn't think I was world class at anything which I still believe I'm not world classed anything.

20
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But then I don't know if you reframe the question or if I just kind of reframed it in a way that I could appropriately answer it. And I said something long lines of if I had to say that I had some skill sets that help me.

21
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I think that those skill sets would be number one, being able to take complex things and make them simple.

22
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And then being able to communicate those things in a simple way that other people can understand.

23
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And then number two was the ability to detach myself mentally and emotionally from whatever situation I'm in.

24
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And I believe that allows me to see it more clearly.

25
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So those are the two things that I think helped me out throughout my career and that I might be decent at doing.

26
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So I wanted to talk through some principles that we reflect on a lot, but in a more pragmatic way, just to ensure, or at least to help everyone put some of these principles to use in our current environment.

27
00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And I've also been thinking about talking about how some of the principles that I talk about apply to what is going on today.

28
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
This is not, no, what I don't want to do is do some kind of a current events thing.

29
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
This is the greatest news story. And this is because I don't, to me that's not, that's not going to last long.

30
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Right, people need, if you use a current day example that takes some, you have to understand the backstory behind this news thing so you can apply it.

31
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I'm not really looking to do that because I want somebody to be able to listen to this in six years and say, oh, there's a good, there's a good angle I didn't see before and this is going to help me with my leadership situation that I'm in right now.

32
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Or it's going to help me with my life, the way I'm in right now. It's going to help me get through overcome this challenge that I'm facing right now.

33
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So to make it a little bit more evergreen is the term, right, am I using what is an industry terminology evergreen?

34
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I learned evergreen from you. So I did you evergreen means you can listen to this podcast in 10 years and still make sense.

35
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.000
You're not referring to some random, you know, TMZ news story that just came out and everybody's high bonnet.

36
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:18.000
But I think we can remain or maintain the evergreen aspect of the podcast and still put in some some of the current events that are going on right now or at least some of the

37
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:33.000
more outstanding current events and you know some of this have done on unraveling with Darryl Cooper. I know we did Afghanistan. We've talked about Ukraine. So there's things that he and I hit on that podcast to

38
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:45.000
kind of discuss from my perspective what's going on with these situations and even those are difficult because they changed so rapidly things changed so rapidly.

39
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And I was just having a conversation with about about this with J.P. this morning about, you know, he served me say a million times at the first report the first report so it's wrong.

40
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And he was, you know, going through situation he's like, hey, is the first report always wrong? I said, yeah, let me refraise that it might not be wrong, but it also might not be right, but you can't just trust.

41
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I might need to modify that a little bit when I say you can't trust the first report because if you call me panicked saying, I think the house is on fire right or the house is on fire the house is on fire.

42
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I can't trust that. I have to put it into my calculus, but look, there could have been a smoke bomb that the teenagers threw through the window and it looks like the house on fire with houses on fire right or the house could be on fire.

43
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So it could be right it could be wrong. What I do know about the first report is I can't trust it 100% unreliable. It's unreliable. So I might need to gather additional information.

44
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So speaking of these topics and speaking of something that comes up all the time.

45
00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And that I call a superpower is the ability to detach.

46
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And this, some people automatically get uncomfortable with that because when I say detach, they think, oh, you told me you shouldn't have any emotions at all right.

47
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And it is talking about detaching from your emotions. It can also mean physically detaching from a situation, but detachment is a superpower. We'll get to the emotional thing and how much you should detach and how much is too much.

48
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I think one of the clearest displays of detachment and how powerful it is.

49
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Well, one of my wrote about leadership strategy and tactics, my first platoon doing the clear and the oil platform, but I had that other situation where I was with Seth.

50
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And we were, he had taken over his task in a commander.

51
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And when he took over his task in a commander, he broke his neck.

52
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Thank God he wasn't paralyzed. So Seth Stone was one of the two commanders in tasked bruiser.

53
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Now he's took over as the tasked commander and he's going through his pre-deployment work up. And I'm in charge of training for all these seal platoons and taskings getting ready to deploy.

54
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And Seth doing a ship boarding where you climb up ladders on two ships from smaller boats.

55
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:26.000
The guy he was the last guy to be climbing the ladder because he's the task commander, so he's not going to be the first guy on deck, right? Because he's sort of taking a step back. He's supposed to be detached. So he's going to be the last guy that goes up.

56
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And as he's going up, the person above my right, let me refer to that.

57
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Right as he was about to start climbing the ladder, one of the other guys fell off the ladder and landed square on top of Seth's head from a fall of about 20 feet. And it broke his neck.

58
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
His spinal cord was intact. Thank God.

59
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So now he's in a big neck brace. And he, but he can still walk around. And his, his task unit is now going through our land warfare training.

60
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So he's out there observing because he can't participate. And as he's participating or as he's observing, and I'm standing with him observing. And it's one of these crazy training exercises.

61
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:23.000
There's total mayhem going on. There's freaking explosions going off. We're using this high speed laser tag system. There's dead people everywhere. Again, this is training. So they're not actually dead. But they're, they're, they're laser tag system is saying that you're dead.

62
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So there's body strewn all over the place and no one's moving and no one's making any calls. It's total disaster. And they're in in a ravine.

63
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And the enemy in quotes is in an elevated position and they're just tearing up this Seth's task unit. And Seth, he looks at me. So I can't tell him what to do. I said no.

64
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I said, just let him figure it out. And another 30 seconds go by. More guys get shot with laser tag. Let me help him. And I go, not yet. Another 30 seconds go by. More guys get shot.

65
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And mind you, his guys are in this ravine. We're actually in the ravine with them. Now, they're kind of prone position or maybe on their knees and we're standing up. But we're in the ravine with them.

66
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And finally, he says, he, more guys get shot. He goes, let me help him. And I go, all right, go ahead. And he grabs a random dude, not a leader, just a random guy.

67
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And he says, I remembered exactly what he said the other night. He said, do I add, which is, which is the most broad, the most broad instruction to give someone.

68
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Because no one's making any decisions. And an eye add is an immediate action drill, which means when you have a play in football, what's a play in football? Tell me like a play right now.

69
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
That you guys used to run. That you were a part of. 38.

70
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Okay, so 38 sweep. So now everybody knows what to do when you call that. Give me another one.

71
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
41 sweep. Okay, 41 sweep. Now everyone's doing something a little bit different, but we're making adjustments. So you literally have plays like that.

72
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And you would say if you were going to tell your football team, you'd say call a play right? What Seth was saying was, do I ads, which is the same thing as saying call a play.

73
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So he just grabs a random dude and says, hey, and some probably something new guy or one cruise wonder like all freaked out because everyone's getting shot.

74
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And you know, Seth gets into this face like, do I ads? And the kid looks up at Seth and's okay. And he makes a call.

75
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Whatever, whatever, 38 sweeper, 41 sweeper, peel left peel right shift left shift right whatever the call was.

76
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
This kid actually makes a call and almost immediately the problem solved, right?

77
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Almost immediately they start executing this play and people start putting down cover fire. Other people start to move in it and it solves the problem.

78
00:11:47.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And as they get out of the area and get out of the kilzone, Seth looks at me and he says, it's so easy to see what to do from way up here.

79
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And let me remind you, way up here in that situation was simply that we were standing up.

80
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Like we were in some elevated position, we weren't in an aircraft flying round over. No, we could just see a little bit more. And by the way, the position we were in was a tactically sound position.

81
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So just by looking around and not getting tunnel vision and detaching whatever it is, probably 20 inches higher than the other people because they're on their knees and you're standing up.

82
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So you got like what, maybe two feet of additional altitude and you can see everything. And I looked at him and I said, well, I said something long.

83
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
That's what we're not, we're with them. We're not way up here. We're 24 inches above them.

84
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And he's like, oh yeah, and I said, but you're looking around, your detach. He says, oh yeah.

85
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And then I said, you remember when we went through this training and he says, yeah, and I said, this is what it was like for me all the time.

86
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And he had a look on his face of sort of recognition kind of like, oh dang.

87
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So all the confusion and chaos that was going on. I was always looking at like, okay, uh, peel off, you know, shift right swift, what a swing 32.

88
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:30.000
What it was really easy to make the cause because you're looking at it and you can see it. And that is the, that is the power of being able to detach and it is.

89
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You would think that now this is where this is why I'm talking about this stuff right now because you would think if I explain that to you, you go, okay, cool. Thanks, Jockel. Now I'm going to detach right right.

90
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
That's what we would hope for.

91
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
But there's a problem. It's not that easy. In fact, this can be very difficult to do.

92
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So here are some of the mechanics of being able to detach.

93
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And some of these are a little bit like training wheels, a little bit like like learning aids that once you get good at it, you won't need to do it anymore.

94
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:14.000
But you should remember, anyways, because there might be some situations where shit really starts going sideways and you have to go back, put your training wheels on and kind of keep put, get it back together.

95
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000
So one of the first training wheels is take a step back, a physical step back.

96
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.000
A physical step back. This is going to change your perspective. It changes your perspective perspective and here's, here's a little like a little.

97
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:44.000
A little extra advice. And it's weird to say this. Lift your chin up and look around.

98
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And the reason I say lift your chin up is because when you lift your chin up, you're changing your perspective a little bit, right?

99
00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Even if it's only by a half an inch when you lift your chin up, you're kind of opening up yourself. You're opening up to new ideas.

100
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It's the opposite of a fight stance. What are you doing here fight? If you're going to get a fight, you put your chin down, you put your hands up.

101
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
So in this situation, and again, this is like a non-threatening situation.

102
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So if you're coming at me, if you're like some kind of hostile or unknown and you're coming at me and you're confronting me, obviously I'm not going to lift my chin up and put my hands down.

103
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:31.000
That's totally different. What I will do is keep my chin down, lift my hands up. I will step back. I will create space so that I can see more of what's happening.

104
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Because I don't know you got buddies. You know, I don't know if there's what my surroundings have.

105
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I don't know if there's weapons available to me. So I'm going to get my hands up. But I am going to broaden my perspective.

106
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And this is something that we talked about when Andrew Cuban was on here.

107
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:08.000
It really calms you. It calms you down. So that's one of the steps of the attachment. So take a step back, lift your chin, look around, and then take a breath. A nice slow breath.

108
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Because this is nothing that's going to calm you down. It's another thing that's going to let you get control over your emotions.

109
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And this is something that people intuitively remember when you were a little kid and you'd be having a temper tantrum.

110
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
I've seen it done. Okay. When your kids are having a temper tantrum, have you ever said like, hey, just take a breath.

111
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And this is something even. Okay. Let me give you a better example. You get hurt. Oh, your kid gets hurt.

112
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And they're right. What do you tell them? Hey, take a breath calm down. Like take a breath. That's what we tell people to do.

113
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
That's crazy. You said that example because it was watching old videos of my son like did some thing.

114
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It was a funny video. But you know, at the end of the video he trips over something falls down.

115
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
He's like, what kind of he does near whatever and same deal and literally played out on the video.

116
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
But I was just watching that video. So like, I said, yeah, on the video. I was like, why is it breathe?

117
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Breathe. Breathe.

118
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
It's true.

119
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Yeah.

120
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Very appropriate.

121
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000
When Hickson was on here, Hickson wrote a book called Breathe. Right. So there's a reason for this.

122
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And it's it's proven by experience of people that have been in pressure situations. And it's proven through

123
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Doctors who can tell you about the physiological impact of taking a nice slow breath.

124
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So that's what we're doing. This is going to help you detach in these pressure situations.

125
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Now listen, there's another little like a note.

126
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Let's say you're, let's say you and I work together and you're pissed off.

127
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
This is a lot different than you and I don't know each other and you're confronting me. Right.

128
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
That's a self defense situation. Hands are coming up. I'm still going to de-escalate.

129
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I'm going to step back. I'm going to create space all those things. I'm trying to de-escalate.

130
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And by the way, I'm trying to get detached as well.

131
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Because let's say, you know, you bumped into or I bumped into your girlfriend and spilled drinks on you and now you're all mad.

132
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Yeah.

133
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I don't know you, but now you're all mad. You're coming at me.

134
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Should I escalate my anger? Because you're coming at me?

135
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Or because you yell, swear at me and you push me?

136
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Should I let my anger get me?

137
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
No, I should not. Because then bad things are going to happen.

138
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Instead, I should be stepping back creating distance looking around, getting my hands into a,

139
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
into a defensive, yet non-threatening, open aspect towards you.

140
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
That's what I need to do. Now, if you're not, but that's in a life threat or a self-defense situation.

141
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
But in just a normal UNI are talking and you start getting pissed.

142
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
But UNI worked together when I'm probably going to do as I step back as I take a breath.

143
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
As I, as I brought my field, I'm, I'm probably going to just nod my head and let you know that I'm listening to what you're saying.

144
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And we're going to talk more about listening.

145
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
But that's what I'm going to do.

146
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
That's what I'm going to do.

147
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And as I wrote about in extreme ownership, I'm going to relax, look around, make a call.

148
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000
That's it. That was the earliest way of me trying to teach Seth how to detach.

149
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Was me saying me writing on his home view window, hey, things are going wild.

150
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Step one, relax, step two, look around, step three, make a call.

151
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
That's the earliest sort of verse I'm trying to convey this message to someone.

152
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I didn't know how to say detach yet. Didn't, it didn't compute.

153
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
I was just trying to tell them the physical act of what to do.

154
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Freaking relax, bro. Look around, see what else is going on.

155
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Okay, now make a call.

156
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Now, here's the deal on this stuff.

157
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
You can't see anything when you're in the thing.

158
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
You can't see anything when you're in the thing.

159
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And the solution to the problem isn't in the problem.

160
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And look, there's a mass shooting that just happened in a school horrible.

161
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
People keep saying, oh, when are you going to say about it?

162
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I need to see some after actions reports.

163
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I need to find out what happened. I don't know what happened.

164
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
There's one of the things that I could tell you as you train people to handle horrible situations like that.

165
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
You need to teach people to detach.

166
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Because if they're not detached, they can't see the solution to the problem.

167
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
All they see is what's right in front of them.

168
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
So if you've got a shooter, an active shooter in a building,

169
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
and you go into that building and you haven't been trained properly, you're going to get focused on that active shooter.

170
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Then if you think, oh, the active shooter isn't an active shooter anymore.

171
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
It's a barricade shooter.

172
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
You're going to, oh, that's a barricade shooter.

173
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Now I'm going to follow this other tactic technique or procedure.

174
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Because you're focused on what's right in front of your focused on that piece of information that you have.

175
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And you're not going to take a step back and go, hey, what's really happening right now?

176
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Who can give me a report?

177
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Who has accountability for the students?

178
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
How many students are there?

179
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
How many are missing?

180
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Where are they located?

181
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Who's assembling that big picture?

182
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
You know who's assembling that big picture?

183
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Someone that's detached from the situation.

184
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Hmm.

185
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
And it is not easy to train people to do that.

186
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
It used to take me a while to get a seal.

187
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Sometimes a seal that'd been in for five years, seven years, ten years,

188
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
to get them to be able to, oh, there's mayhem going on in this building.

189
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
I need to be the one that takes a step back, looks at the big picture.

190
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And figures out what's actually happening.

191
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.000
The putting people through that advanced seal tackle training, the primary purpose

192
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
was to get them to learn how to detach.

193
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
And again, at the time, I didn't say it with these exact words.

194
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
You know, I'd say you knew you set back, look at the big picture.

195
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
You know, like I was trying to convey it the best I could at the time,

196
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I might have used the word detach.

197
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
But I know I would say things like, hey, take a step back, look around.

198
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
You need to see this stuff.

199
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
You need to look at the big picture.

200
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
That was me trying to get these young seal leaders like Seth Stone.

201
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Hey, dude, relax and look around.

202
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
That's what you need to do.

203
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Because once we could get those young seal leaders to actually do that,

204
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
all of a sudden they could solve these complex problems that we would throw out.

205
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
If they couldn't detach, no, no, if no one in a platoon detached, no one would solve the problem,

206
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
and they would get slaughtered.

207
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
If one person could take a step back and say, oh, wait,

208
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
we shouldn't keep going down this hallway, or we shouldn't keep moving up this street.

209
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Or we shouldn't keep going up this ravine.

210
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Or we should go backwards right now.

211
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Or we should find that.

212
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
If one person can see that, they win.

213
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
If nobody sees it, they get slaughtered.

214
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
So my primary goal with the leaders teaching them how to lead,

215
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
the first thing they had to do is be able to detach.

216
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Now, once you detach, then you can see.

217
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Then you teach them, okay, here's how you want to use the terrain.

218
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Here's the effective way to maneuver.

219
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Here's where you want to concentrate your forces.

220
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Like, all those things are great.

221
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
If you can't detach, you can't do any of those things.

222
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
It's a lot harder than it looks.

223
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
It's a lot harder than it seems,

224
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
and the hype and the emotion and the energy,

225
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
it tends to make us not want to detach.

226
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
And the natural tendency that we have as human beings

227
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
is to focus on what's right in front of us.

228
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
This is the natural tendency.

229
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
That's how we survived as hunter-gatherers.

230
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
As a hunter-gatherer, you either, okay, if you're a hunter,

231
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
guess what, you gotta be focused on.

232
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
You see movement, and it's a freaking pig that you're going to slaughter,

233
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
kill with a bone arrow or a spear or whatever.

234
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
You need to hype or focus on that thing.

235
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
As an individual human, you need to hype or focus on that thing.

236
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
If you're walking around and you see movement,

237
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
and it's a tiger, you need to focus on that thing.

238
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
It needs to become your number one priority.

239
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
And in order to survive, you need to focus.

240
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
You need to get high-profocused, and that's what we're programmed for.

241
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
And there's sometimes as an individual, you gotta do that sometimes.

242
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
It's actually a great thing to have.

243
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
You know, you're walking down the street,

244
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
and all of a sudden the cars coming up on the sidewalk,

245
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
you focus on that thing, so you can avoid it.

246
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
You've ever seen that like when they're trying to get a robot

247
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
to catch a ball.

248
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
It has to do eight billion calculations in point two seconds

249
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
to catch a ball.

250
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
I don't even know if there's a robot that can catch a fast ball

251
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
from a pitcher.

252
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Yeah, like a humanoid robot, even with the size,

253
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
with a glove, the size of a catcher's mitt.

254
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Or like a eye-gain almost guaranteed to you

255
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
that they can't make one that could hit a baseball bat.

256
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
I don't know.

257
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
I've never seen one.

258
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
If that's, there's a billion little calculations

259
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
that have to get made.

260
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
And I've also heard like baseball players win that,

261
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
win the ball leaves, the pitchers hand.

262
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Like they're already predicting where it's going to be.

263
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I mean, obviously they are because they can hit it

264
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
with a freaking skinny little bat.

265
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
You know what I'm saying?

266
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Yeah.

267
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
So there's times where this is fully beneficial.

268
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And that's what our, that's our natural tendency is

269
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
is to get focused on this thing.

270
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
That's right in front of us.

271
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
But as leaders,

272
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
and honestly in some situations as individuals,

273
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
you're going to have a problem if you do that.

274
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
And I think I was thinking about this on from 100% right.

275
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
But it mostly has to do when you're dealing with humans.

276
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
When you're dealing with a human threat.

277
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Because humans do coordinated attacks.

278
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Yeah.

279
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Right?

280
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Sure.

281
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Like, oh, wolf, you might get attacked by a pack of wolves.

282
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
You'll lose just because they all attack you at the same time.

283
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
And you might get eaten by a pack of sharks.

284
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
But it's not because one distracted you and the other one snuck up.

285
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And you know what I'm saying?

286
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
There's a difference between mob attacks,

287
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
which I think is what most animals do.

288
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
And what humans do,

289
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
which is humans are setting you up like a sucker and flanking you.

290
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Right?

291
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
That's what humans do.

292
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
That's what a, that's what like a sucker punches.

293
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Right?

294
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Oh, a sucker punches like, oh, you're there talking to me.

295
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
I'm like, I'll beat you and boom, my buddy punches you inside of the head.

296
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Or hit you with a bottle from behind.

297
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
That's what humans do.

298
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Humans are savages.

299
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
And so even as individuals, sometimes if you get target fixation,

300
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
you're going to have a problem.

301
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
So when we're in complex situations,

302
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
there could be an emergency, right?

303
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Emergency, a fire of a vehicle accident.

304
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
There's a lot of stuff going on.

305
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Combat situations, obviously.

306
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And you know what else?

307
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
This is where you make that mental transition.

308
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
An argument with someone.

309
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Maybe not even argument, but in the bait with someone.

310
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
You've ever seen someone get lured in an argument and just flanked.

311
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Yeah.

312
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
And it's because they didn't detach.

313
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Uh, a few good men.

314
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Yes.

315
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Right?

316
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
That's what it is, it's just a big flank, right?

317
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I'm going to get this guy so mad and so emotional.

318
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Yeah.

319
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
That when I ask him this question, he's going to expose himself.

320
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Yep.

321
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
And that's what Tom Cruise does, right?

322
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
You're got down right.

323
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
I already, the code read.

324
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
That's exactly what he does.

325
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
The kernel in that movie.

326
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Jack Nick, Jack Nicholson.

327
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Nicholson, yes sir.

328
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Jack Nicholson, he didn't detach.

329
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
No.

330
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
He could have seen through that so easily.

331
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Yep.

332
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
He could have been like, no, I absolutely would not order that.

333
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
You can, if you had a few videos calm.

334
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Yeah.

335
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
He didn't, that's a perfect example of how we can let this idea

336
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
bite us.

337
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Yeah.

338
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
So if perhaps, what's the kernel's name in that movie?

339
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Jessup.

340
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Cruf, if kernel Jessup, maybe if he would have gone through my landlord for a train

341
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
back in the day.

342
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
You know, like, oh, I'm about to get flanked by homeboy.

343
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
If I'm young Tom Cruise, you know, kernel Jessup would have said,

344
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
actually, no, negative.

345
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
There's no way I'd give that order, but then said he got emotionally.

346
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
F flanked like a little punk.

347
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
So imagine how much that happens to us or can't happen to us.

348
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
So that's what we have to learn how to do in everything.

349
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
And here's a little connection I'm going to make for you.

350
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:45.000
There's a connection between being humble and being able to detach.

351
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And the connection is, if you're not humble, if you got a big ego, you think you're the

352
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
center of the world.

353
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Right?

354
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
You think you're, you think you are the center of the world.

355
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And when you think you're the center of the world, you can't see anyone else's emotions.

356
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
You can't see anyone else's moves.

357
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
There moves don't even mean anything to you because you're just looking at everything

358
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
as Jaco Centric, echo centric.

359
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
It's all about me.

360
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
So I don't see that you're getting mad.

361
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
I don't see that you're getting frustrated.

362
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And that's what we have to be careful about.

363
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Because if you think you're the most important thing and you've got that gravity,

364
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.000
it's pulling everything in and all of other ideas,

365
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
then they don't make it.

366
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Other, they nothing else can survive this strong gravity that you got.

367
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
You don't see anything else.

368
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
What's the difference between detaching and situational awareness?

369
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Right?

370
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
What's, I mean, is there a difference?

371
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
If they're not the same thing, then they're damn close.

372
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
I would say I would say this.

373
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Detachment is senior to situational awareness.

374
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
If you're not detached, you're not going to have any situational awareness.

375
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
If you are detached, you will have much more situational awareness.

376
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Detachment is senior because not only am I detached, so I can see what's happening in the situation.

377
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
I'm also aware of my emotions.

378
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
I'm aware of your emotions.

379
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Does the situation include everything?

380
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Okay, then they're probably the same thing.

381
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
If we're saying that situation overall includes your emotions, my emotions are physical space that we're in.

382
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Everything that's occurring.

383
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
If that's the situation, okay, then they're probably pretty close to the same thing.

384
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000
I generally think of situational awareness as to being what's our physical thing that's happening.

385
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
But it's not too much to different to say, oh, echo is a possible attacker?

386
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Is he agitated?

388
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Yeah, exactly.

389
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
That would be situational awareness.

390
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Oh, I can see he's frustrated.

391
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
I can see he's his fist or clenched.

392
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Okay, that's all situational awareness.

393
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
So there are really similar things.

394
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:11.000
But I think I still think detachment is a senior element because if you don't have detachment, it ain't happening.

395
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
You're not going to have situational awareness at all.

396
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Yeah, it feels like most of the time, see, they bring up detaching is when you're kind of in the one that chaotic situation kind of already started.

397
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Or it's almost like, I guess you can constantly be detached though, right?

398
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I mean, not completely.

399
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
I mean, you know, I have time to hurt you explain. You're like, don't go too far with this thing.

400
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Right? You don't care about nothing or whatever, but, uh, seems like detaching when I imagine it, I guess, is, yeah, when something like happens to kind of escalator whatever.

401
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
And then it's like, okay, then you should kind of detach or whatever.

402
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
And you know what? Good point. Check this out.

403
00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:01.000
The, the black belt. He's likely not even going to get the situation to a point where he has detach because he's already attached to any sees it.

404
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Come on, he doesn't have to worry about it because he already outfanked it. That's the game.

405
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
That's the game. That's what we're trying to do.

406
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Unless he's going to up against another black belt unless he's going up on this.

407
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Then, thus begins the psychological game within the game.

408
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Yeah. And then you are end up in straight, due to where how many moves ahead, you know, M.I.

409
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
To you. And my five moves ahead and you're only four. I'm going to win.

410
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
If I'm five moves ahead, but you're seven, you're going to win. That's what's happening.

411
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:39.000
So, there is a connection between the more self-centered we are, the less the rest of the world matters.

412
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And therefore, it's hard to step outside of your own world.

413
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Yeah. Maybe that's a better way of putting it.

414
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Yeah, that seems accurate.

415
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
You know, for instance, a little kid that loses their temper. Why is that?

416
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Because they're the whole world in the store. In the store.

417
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
They don't care about anything else. They want that freaking ice cream cone.

418
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
That's what's up. So they don't care about anything else.

419
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Yeah. And they're not going to be able to attach at all.

420
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Yeah. And they don't care about anything else.

421
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
So the younger you are, you're really important.

422
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Yeah. So we have to be careful with that.

423
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Here's another little element. Detachment is what actually allows you to think strategic.

424
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
It's what actually allows you to think strategic.

425
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Because the definition of what I started with of saying,

426
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Hey, I'm worried about the person that's shooting me right now.

427
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
That's a short term thinking.

428
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Now, do I have to focus on that right now? Because I'm getting shot at, yes, I do.

429
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
The minute I eliminate that threat, I better take a step back and look around and get my platoon into position,

430
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
where I don't have to worry about threats.

431
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
So I can see where we need to go next.

432
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000
So unless we are detached unless you take a minute, you know, if you're in business and every day,

433
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
you show up to work the phones, ring in the emails or comment in your solving this problem for a client or dealing with operations,

434
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
your deal with sales. You got all these problems. You're just that's what you're doing all day.

435
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Cool.

436
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
But you're not detached. And therefore you're thinking about tactical things that are right in front of you.

437
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
And you might win the day tactically, but you look up in six months and you've, you've got some issues,

438
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
because you didn't order enough material for the next project and you didn't hire enough,

439
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
like all these problems are happening. Strategic problems are happening.

440
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
So unless you're able to detach, you're not able to think strategic.

441
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
So think about how this impact your life.

442
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:42.000
And this is, you know, from you echo Charles, you've said before to me that the most important thing that you've taken away from hanging out with me for the last however many years

443
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
is thinking strategic instead of tactical.

444
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
And the way that translates to this civilian world is you think long term instead of short term.

445
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
And that I agree with you.

446
00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:01.000
And we have a, you've heard me say before and you pulled a clip from one of the, uh, musters where a guy asked me, you know,

447
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
how often should I think strategic and I said you should think strategic all the time.

448
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
You said it differently.

449
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Yeah, I was a little, little more amped at the time.

450
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
But if you can't detach, if you don't take a step back, you will or not thinking strategic.

451
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Yeah.

452
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
That's why this is like a superpower.

453
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Detachment allows you to not focus on the short term.

454
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
It avoids tactical thinking.

455
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Now, it also avoids you getting emotional and making bad decisions because that's when you make bad decisions.

456
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Are you guaranteed to make a bad decision where you're emotional?

457
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
No.

458
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
But I mean, there's a real good chance.

459
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Pretty reliable.

460
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Yeah, it's pretty reliable that an emotional decision is not the best decision.

461
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
It's pretty reliable.

462
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Now, does this mean I'm sitting there saying it for everyone that's, you know, out there.

463
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Oh, you know, you say and you shouldn't have any emotions.

464
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
That's actually not what I'm saying.

465
00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000
And all what I'm saying is you shouldn't let your emotions run your decisions.

466
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Yeah.

467
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
They do right.

468
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Control over your emotions does not mean not having emotions.

469
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Because emotions are important.

470
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
We like to say.

471
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Yes.

472
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Emotions are important.

473
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
My emotions are important.

474
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
My teams emotions are important.

475
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
My boss's emotions are important.

476
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
The competitor or the enemy emotions are important.

477
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
And I, okay, how can they be important?

478
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Well, if I, if you're mad about something that you need to do,

479
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Are you going to do a good job?

480
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
And you do, if you work for me, are you going to do your best job?

481
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
If, on the contrary, if you're super excited about something,

482
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Are you going to do a good job?

483
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Yeah.

484
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
What if you're my enemy?

485
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
And your morale is low and you're emotionally drained?

486
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Is it going to be an opportune time to fight you?

487
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Yes, it is.

488
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
What if you're, what if I've done something to your people?

489
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
And now you're mad and you're going to fight with vengeance.

490
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
You're angry.

491
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Is, is that a good time for me to attack you from what your my enemy?

492
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
No.

493
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
What about my boss?

494
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
My boss is super angry about something.

495
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
How will good time to present a new solution to it? No.

496
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Is that like the old classic, don't tell your wife to calm down?

497
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
That is part of the classic. Don't tell your wife to calm down.

498
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Because like, yes, she's not, she's emotional.

499
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Whatever, we're in vice versa.

500
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
But, you know, but the, yeah, when you say, hey, calm down.

501
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
That's not a good move.

502
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Does that a strategic?

503
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
So you can see how emotions play into each one of those elements that I just talked about.

504
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Yeah. So I have, oh, and by the way, I have to know my emotions too, right?

505
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:48.000
If I've got some massive task and I know I'm already drained or angry about it.

506
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
If I've got some delicate, if I'm mad at you, I know, yeah, I've got to go and discuss a project with you.

507
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
And I'm already mad that you didn't do something.

508
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Is that a good time for me to go in? They're not talking to you. No, it's not.

509
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000
So what I need to do and a way to think the emotions are own emotions

510
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:13.000
and other people's emotions up down across the chain of command need to be in the calculus of our decision making.

511
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
That's what I need to do.

512
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:28.000
And a lot of times, in current times, this is 2022, we don't take other people's emotions into our calculus.

513
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
So you have to measure.

514
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:43.000
You have to measure if and how what you are going to say, how it's going to impact your family.

515
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
If it's going to impact your family, your team, yourself. You have to measure that.

516
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Is it going to make them angry? Is it going to make them upset? Is it going to make them lose motivation?

517
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Is it going to cross their morale?

518
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
And if you don't put that, but if you don't put all the emotional element into the calculus,

519
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
you're going to get the wrong answer.

520
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And by the way, you won't be able to assess any of these emotions if you're not detached.

521
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
You won't see your own emotions. You won't see other people's emotions.

522
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
You won't be like, oh, my wife is mad right now because you're mad.

523
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
So you don't see them as being mad. And even if you do see them as being mad, you're mad.

524
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
So you just get mad at them for being mad.

525
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
What you have to do is be able to detach and get some level of control over your emotions.

526
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000
So when I talk about detaching from your emotions, I'm not talking about having no emotions.

527
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
And by the way, if you detach from your emotions too much and now you're interacting with your team,

528
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
your team just thinks you're a jerk. That's what's happening.

529
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
So yeah, like you don't care. Oh yeah, like you don't care.

530
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Oh, that's a huge deal. Like when your boss doesn't care, is it distracted or just when you have that feeling is what I'm saying.

531
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Or if you give that feeling to your wife, you know, something that you're talking about to me,

532
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
who's all your time.

533
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Because that kind of is the deal, right?

534
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Where you like, you lit every single list item or everything,

535
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
every topic you talked about literally has directly to do.

536
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
I mean, look, some people not married, I get it.

537
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
But if you are even girlfriend boyfriend scenario, whatever.

538
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
That applies to you in your life.

539
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
100%.

540
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Oh yeah, it's like the end of your kids.

541
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
So the kids, there is a you, it's playing, yeah, it's more like,

542
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
I don't know, it's like, it is the same thing. It's the same format for sure.

543
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000
But you explain this too, where it's like your kids are going to be different than like other people because

544
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
when you have kids, that's a very unique relationship.

545
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
It's very unique.

546
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Like you can't, you can't just switch out one kid for another kid and make the connection.

547
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
So it's supposed to make what's the connection?

548
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
The emotions.

549
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
The emotions.

550
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Yeah, the connection.

551
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:04.000
That's what makes it, you know, your emotional attachment to your kids is so strong.

552
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:16.000
It's so strong that you have to be even more cautious in how you and how you calculate the emotions up and down the chain.

553
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
So it's kind of like the difference between a muffin and a cupcake.

554
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
But I don't know the difference between those two.

555
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
I think one just has more sugar in it.

556
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Is that the truth?

557
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
I don't know.

558
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Which one has more sugar?

559
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Cupcake.

560
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Okay.

561
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Seems same?

562
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Yeah, I guess.

563
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
The kids have more sugar.

564
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
They have more emotion.

565
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
More emotions.

566
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
A type of, or involved in the equation.

567
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000
But you handle them the same way.

568
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
We're trying not to eat them.

569
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Yeah.

570
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
80 to 90% of the time.

571
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Seems same.

572
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Yep.

573
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
So you can't see any of these emotions if you're not detached.

574
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
So go back to first topic of the day, take a step back, relax, look around, take a breath,

575
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
get detached, and then put the emotions, comprehend the emotions, put them into your

576
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
calculus as you're making decisions, as you're communicating with people.

577
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
And that's going to put you in a different, put you in a better scenario.

578
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Now, here's another thing that you can utilize for detachment, which is very powerful,

579
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
not just for detachment, but for life and definitely for leadership.

580
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
And that is actually listening to what other people are saying.

581
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
And I've been saying for a couple of years now, listening is the most unarrated skill in leadership.

582
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:40.000
And I think I have to take it a little bit further and I'll think it about a good way to explain listening.

583
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Because listening doesn't just mean be quiet.

584
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Okay, echo is talking now as soon as you're done.

585
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
I'm ready to present my ideas back at you.

586
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
I don't know where we did this.

587
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
I think we probably just did this on a Q&A while ago, but people will have often asked me,

588
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
what is my process for reading a book?

589
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000
And I've talked through my process for reading a book and reading a book for the podcast, really.

590
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000
So if I'm reading a book for the podcast, I'm going to read it actively.

591
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
It's an active reading.

592
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
I'm not passively.

593
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
The words aren't just coming into my head and there they are.

594
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
And no, I'm actively reading the words.

595
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
That means I am putting the words into context in my own head.

596
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
In the story that it is.

597
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000
And then how my mind understands that story and what the context in the story is.

598
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
And then how that context fits in my head.

599
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Because that's face it.

600
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
I found reading with the old breed.

601
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
There's context to that story.

602
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
To that particular sentence, that particular paragraph, that particular word, this context around it.

603
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
And it's not just the word.

604
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
It's not just a paragraph.

605
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
There's a whole world there that you have to try and understand.

606
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
This context that you have to have.

607
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
And then you have to put it into your own context.

608
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000
And look, you don't have to have been in combat to understand or to put your own context around it.

609
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
You go, oh, these guys haven't eaten for six days.

610
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Hey, I remember yesterday.

611
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
I didn't have any lunch.

612
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
By the end of the day, I was starving.

613
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
God, now these guys are six years.

614
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000
You have to really try and engage your own brain and overlay your own experiences on it.

615
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
And try and understand and truly put yourself into other people's perspective.

616
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
What do they know that I can try and understand?

617
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
So to me, that's active reading.

618
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Really active reading.

619
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000
And that's what we need to do with listening.

620
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Actively listen.

621
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Actively try and understand what you're trying to say.

622
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Actively try and understand your perspective.

623
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
What does echo know that I don't know right now?

624
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000
How can I actively try and understand what he's saying?

625
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.000
And of course, one of the biggest obstacles to truly listening is having a big giant ego.

626
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
And I think echo alone, no, he's not going to mind.

627
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
You know what I mean?

628
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Like, oh, hey, John, you always put my arm.

629
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Oh, my hips over here on my arm. Oh, echo's trying to get me instructions on your jits.

630
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Oh, yeah.

631
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
You know what I'm saying?

632
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.000
That's what our ego gets in the way because how could anybody possibly know anything more than me?

633
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
So we don't really listen.

634
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.000
And I think I think that as we look at society today,

635
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:57.000
there is a lot of talking and not a lot of listening.

636
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
And it turns into me and here's the thing.

637
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Talking, no listening, and therefore no, no bridges, no common ground found.

638
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
No changes of opinion. People don't change opinion.

639
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Right? I got my opinion. I'm right.

640
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
I'm not going to change my opinion. That's where people are at.

641
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
That's where the vast majority of people are at.

642
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Seems like you.

643
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Oh, I shouldn't see you say the vast.

644
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
That's where the loudest people are at.

645
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
I guess it's worth saying.

646
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Yeah.

647
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Yeah.

648
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
I think it's an issue.

649
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
I think it's a huge issue.

650
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
I think it's a issue for myself, even.

651
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
A lot of it's an issue for everybody.

652
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Myself, for yourself, everybody that's in the world.

653
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Is hey, I kind of know the deal here.

654
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Yeah, I know this.

655
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
You're not going to tell me anything.

656
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Yeah.

657
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
And what's horrible about that is,

658
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
you know, if you were presenting a plan to me for an operation,

659
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
you're not going to be able to do that.

660
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
And I have a difference of opinion in the new.

661
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
And so I, and but I don't listen to what you're saying.

662
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Are we going to come up with a better plan or a worse plan?

663
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Plymercy.

664
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
It's going to be a worse plan.

665
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Where is the faculty? Oh, echoes presenting a plan to me.

666
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Let me truly actively listen to what he's saying.

667
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Let me see how that fits into the idea that I have.

668
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And where's the common ground?

669
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
What? Oh, and we got some, we got some,

670
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
and we got some.

671
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Who's right? And you know what I actually say?

672
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
How is echo right?

673
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
That's the biggest trick right there.

674
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
When it comes to leadership, one of the biggest tricks in leadership is

675
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
how is echo right? I'm the leader, but how is echo right?

676
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
How can I make echo right? How can I listen to him?

677
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
How can I make him, how can I give him the, the, the,

678
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
the advantage here?

679
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Not how can I prove him wrong?

680
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
I don't want you to be wrong. I want you to be right.

681
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Yeah.

682
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
So that's what we have to do. Now when we listen, just like reading,

683
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
when we actively listen, we actively read,

684
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:01.000
ask yourself or ask them and yourself earnest questions.

685
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Put yourself in their shoes, in real life, and this is hard to do.

686
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
In real life, in real life, truly,

687
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
how would I feel if I were that person?

688
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000
And you know sometimes like, you know, echo, let's see.

689
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Echo didn't pay for his phone.

690
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
He got his phone cut off, right?

691
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
So I go, what a loser.

692
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Like he, he's an idiot. He deserves it.

693
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Yeah.

694
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
That's as far, like, oh, well, okay.

695
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
If I was an echo, she was an onion,

696
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
I didn't pay my phone bill and it got cut off.

697
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
I would think I was a loser.

698
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
That's like my perspective.

699
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
And set us in, all right, what's the situation he's in?

700
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
How did he end up here?

701
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000
What doesn't he understand about the world that I understand?

702
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
How come he doesn't understand those things?

703
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
That's what, that's what it is.

704
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
It's like, it takes effort.

705
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Yeah.

706
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
It takes effort to get there.

707
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
And set it just right and it off.

708
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
And I put, I take my entire world view.

709
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
And I take your little chunk of experience that you had by not paying your phone bill.

710
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Like, oh, in my world view, you're a loser.

711
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Yeah.

712
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
That's true.

713
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
That's true.

714
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And so then what, how can I help you?

715
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
I can't, I can't help you.

716
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
I can't help myself.

717
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
I can't help anybody else.

718
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
All I say is, oh, anyone that does that's a loser?

719
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
I'm not, that doesn't solve anything.

720
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
So that's what I think is a, is a huge,

721
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:35.000
a huge piece for us is as a leader and as a person.

722
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And look, those two terms for me are kind of interchangeable.

723
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
I don't know, that sounds crazy.

724
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
But as, this is something that I started saying,

725
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
I think when leadership strategy and tactics came out,

726
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
which is, if you interact with other human beings,

727
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
you're in a leadership position.

728
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
It doesn't matter if, it doesn't matter if you're,

729
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
it doesn't matter if you're the boss.

730
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Yeah.

731
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
And I'm the subordinate.

732
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
And I'm the only subordinate you have.

733
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
I'm a son of a leadership position.

734
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Yeah.

735
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
It doesn't matter if I have one peer.

736
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
And we, and I don't see you even though you're the boss.

737
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
I have one peer.

738
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
I'm still in a leadership position.

739
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
If you interact with other people, you're in a leadership position.

740
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Because you're trying to lead them to do the right thing,

741
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
to moving the right direction.

742
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
And does this mean you're always trying to influence?

743
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
No, because I might be like, oh, Echo's giving me some direction.

744
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
It seems like good call.

745
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Cool.

746
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
I'm going to go execute.

747
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
I don't need to like, well, hold on.

748
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Let me give you more perspective.

749
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
No, no, I'm not talking about that at all.

750
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Am I trying to build a relationship with you?

751
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Yes, I am.

752
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000
And I try to build a relationship so that I can better support you in the future.

753
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000
If you happen to tell me something to do, that doesn't make sense?

754
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Sure.

755
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Yeah, it's good that you differentiate pretty often to the difference between what you call the traditional leader.

756
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
And you know, what?

757
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
And what?

758
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
But what's the other way?

759
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
You don't have a term for the other one?

760
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
No, I certainly do.

761
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000
The sign-let leader.

762
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Sign-let leader.

763
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Yeah, you're right.

764
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
So, okay.

765
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
So, and even though you don't talk about that part,

766
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
we just, we just mentioned like,

767
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
usually it's kind of like, the silent leader is more of like, sort of,

768
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
of maybe influencer type, not influencer like, I don't know.

769
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
But like, you know, someone who just wants to influence people to do the right thing for everybody,

770
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
essentially, right?

771
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
And then the traditional leader is the guy who wants to be the boss and wants everyone to listen to what they said.

772
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Yep.

773
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Everyone listen to me.

774
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Yeah.

775
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Which is the opposite of everything I just talked about, which is saying, if you're a leader, you'd be listening.

776
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Yeah, it's exactly right.

777
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000
But I think that even the word leader, and I said this for where the word leader feels like it,

778
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000
the, like, the boss that, because there are people like that.

779
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
They tell each other, yeah, they tell each other, yeah.

780
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
And because there's people like that.

781
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Like, we all know somebody at least one person, probably, you know,

782
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000
20 people who are like that, where it's like, yeah, you could tell they want to always take charge.

783
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
They want, they always want people to listen to them.

784
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
They always want to do it their way, you know, kind of thing, and, you know, for better words or whatever,

785
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000
it's, I'm just saying that that's when you think of the word leader.

786
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
That's kind of what you think of automatically and when we're in the other.

787
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Yeah.

788
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Absolutely.

789
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:17.000
That's one of the, one of the, I guess, long term campaigns for me as a human being on earth is to convince people and let them know that even if you're a brand new guy in a seal-patoon, you're in a leadership position.

790
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
A brand new guy with no experience, you're in a leadership position.

791
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Even if you're a brand new construction worker with no experience,

792
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
you're in a leadership position.

793
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Even if you're a lineman out there, you're at a apprentice lineman.

794
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000
You have no skills, you're in a leadership position.

795
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:39.000
So, of the four laws of, here's the thing, there's no escaping unless you're a hermit, you're a leader, right?

796
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
So there's no escaping unless you're maybe a newborn baby, I don't know.

797
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.000
But, and this is, this is what I gathered, you know, on the listening to you guys.

798
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000
So, you know, the fourth law of combat, decentralized, come at.

799
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
As we know as a decentralized.

800
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
And the, what is that, the tagline or whatever everybody leads, right?

801
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
So, even if you are a the leader, designated, cross the, you're the boss, either.

802
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
You're the buyer of a company, whatever, you're the dad of the family, whatever, whatever, whatever.

803
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
You're the straight-up boss.

804
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000
But, decentralized command, which is law of combat, says everybody leads.

805
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000
So, even the people who are subordinate to you, quote, I'm quote,

806
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000
they have to lead and whose job is it for them to know how to lead your job.

807
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000
So, everyone's a leader, no matter if you're the boss or not.

808
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Like, you can be the new guy, whatever, and most of us are the new guy and it's seal platoon.

809
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
I'll tell you that.

810
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000
You may or may not know that, but, some, most of us are not.

811
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000
But, like, if you're just the new guy at work or you're the youngest brother or, you know, you're the, you know,

812
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
I've heard that, and I have this scenario.

813
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
I'm going to call it hypothetical, even though it might not be hypothetical.

814
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:56.000
It's not me, that's true, but someone has some people I know, where the husband feels a little bit, what he called,

815
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
like, emasculated sometimes.

816
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000
And not by any abuser, anything like that, but it's just, I think it's like a classic case of, you know,

817
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
what you hear like the husband's always trying to like, happy wife happy life, kind of a thing,

818
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
and maybe went too far with it, and maybe now he finds himself in a position where he's like,

819
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
he's just responding and doing everything that the wife says,

820
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
and the wife doesn't seem happy, kind of a scenario.

821
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.000
I feel like, with this attitude that, like, if you understand, 100% 100% not just like,

822
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
hmm, my situation, sure, I guess I could kind of, if you understand 100% that you are,

823
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
essentially, you have the responsibility to be the leader, and I'm not saying, be the boss.

824
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:43.000
I'm not saying, it always feels like that ends up being absolutely correct,

825
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
as far as solving any problems with any interpersonal relationship.

826
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000
So, let me just restate your, your comment there.

827
00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:01.000
What you're saying is no matter where I am in a relationship, in a platoon, in a business, in a marriage,

828
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:08.000
if my attitude is, I'm in a leadership position, I'm going to lead through this problem.

829
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
The sign that leader is going to be a positive thing.

830
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Yes, sir. Yeah, you are correct. Absolutely.

831
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000
That's why at Ashland Front, that's why we say leadership is the solution.

832
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
And it doesn't matter what the problem is.

833
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Yeah.

834
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Wife's not happy, leadership problem. On me, by the way, on me.

835
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Now, look, could can you occasionally get a miserable scenario where, oh, the wife is,

836
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000
well, there's probably, and actually what you end up there is, if you break that down from a leadership perspective,

837
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
you're probably not aligned in your marriage.

838
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Because that's the one kind of killer.

839
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
There's one, that's one killer.

840
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
So, when I say leadership is a solution, leadership is a solution, all your problems.

841
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000
There's one problem that leadership is the solution for, but you're not going to solve the problem.

842
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
That is alignment. That is, we are not going to the same place.

843
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:13.000
So, if your business partner is going in one direction, like two different place, and you're going in another direction,

844
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:20.000
and it's a different place, you're going to have a really, you won't be able to make decisions that are unified.

845
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:32.000
If your wife, you know, if your wife wants to, you know, have 20 kids, and you don't want to have any,

846
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000
you're not going to be able to work it out.

847
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
You're not working that out.

848
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000
You are heading to a different place. You're going to a different world.

849
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
You're going to two totally different places.

850
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Vice versus true, too. You want to, wait, what do I say? Your wife wants to, when it gets, if it's the opposite, it's the same thing.

851
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000
You want to have 20 kids, your wife doesn't have any. You're going to have a problem.

852
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000
It's going to be a difficult situation. You're probably, you're not aligned.

853
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:08.000
If one person wants to have a software company, and I want to, you know, you and I start designing a little computer game thing.

854
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:15.000
And then you say, hey, we should, we start building these in a factory after we make three of them by ourselves.

855
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000
And I say, no, let's just contract somebody that we should just make the software.

856
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
And you, no, no, we should make the hardware. And I say, no, we should make the software.

857
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
And if you and I can't agree, we're heading to two different places.

858
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000
We're going to have two different companies and you need to go do yours, 90 to go do mine.

859
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:35.000
So where leadership plays, and that is, I need to be able to identify where are we actually going?

860
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
What is our goal? And here's the thing, in most companies, you can find the line.

861
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
That's why people say, we're not aligned. I go, hold on a minute. Oh, you got a company.

862
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
You know, you got acme freaking mouse traps, right?

863
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Yeah, mouse traps.

864
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Echo's got acme mouse traps. And he says, oh, people on my team aren't aligned.

865
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Okay, what do they not want to be able to make money?

866
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
No, of course they want to make money. Do they do they, does everyone on the team want to make money?

867
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Yes, everyone on the team wants to make money. Does everybody on the team want to make a good mouse trap?

868
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Yes, everybody on the team wants to make a good mouse trap. Does everyone on the serve the client? Yes.

869
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Because if we serve the client, we'll sell them mouse traps.

870
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
So you can usually, you take any company.

871
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000
And most of the, the 90, this is a big percentage.

872
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:26.000
99% of the time, there's alignment. And in rare one percent, we're not aligned.

873
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000
And you actually don't want to make mouse traps.

874
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Or you don't want to manufacture mouse traps. Let's say, I want to build a factory in manufactured mouse traps.

875
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
And all you want to do is market them.

876
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000
And you don't want any of this factory stuff. You don't want to hire a bunch of people.

877
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000
You just want to get them shipped from overseas. You're not going to have a problem.

878
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
We're not aligned.

879
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000
I want to build a manufacturing company. You want to build a marketing company.

880
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.000
And we're adamant about it. Now look, we might be able to find the linemen and say, hey, you know what?

881
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000
If we build manufacture them and then you market them well, we kind of on the same page.

882
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Yeah.

883
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000
But if your true goal is not to manufacture anything and my true goal is to, we're going to have a problem.

884
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000
So alignment is.

885
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:17.000
One of the most critical things there are in order to get there. Guess what? I got to listen what you have to say.

886
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Yep.

887
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000
And if we're not aligned, we're going to have a problem.

888
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
So we got to pay attention to that.

889
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000
And this brings me to the last thing I wanted to talk about today.

890
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000
And this is something you know of.

891
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.000
I probably used it. I've probably focused on it a little bit more a few years ago.

892
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000
We're going to have a simple statement that you'll recognize when I say this, free your mind.

893
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Right. We had, we did all kinds of things.

894
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000
I said, free your mind. I'm decasing like post like free your mind.

895
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Sure.

896
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Because our mind or minds tend to have a tendency to be closed.

897
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.000
And not just to be closed, but to be closing.

898
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
So that's the way our human minds are in general.

899
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
They tend to be closed and closing.

900
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
So they're already closed up and they're trying to close even more.

901
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Why is that? Well, it's safer.

902
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Yeah.

903
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It's easier.

904
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I'm not learning anything.

905
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
There's no risk. There's nothing to misunderstand.

906
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
It's just easier across the board if I just close up my mind.

907
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I don't have to accept anything, no.

908
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I'm safe here.

909
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I'm used to it.

910
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
We also have our ego involved.

911
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And our ego is keeping that mind shut.

912
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Because I don't want to have to admit that I'm wrong.

913
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I don't want to have to tell anybody else that they're right.

914
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I don't want to look like I don't know all the answers.

915
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
So I stay in my own little world.

916
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
He looks like, oh, I'm a boxer.

917
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
So I'm not going to do GJ2.

918
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Remember those days?

919
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Like, no, boxing or, oh, you trying to take me out.

920
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I'm just going to knock you out.

921
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Remember those days?

922
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Yeah.

923
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
That gets crazy.

924
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Talk now.

925
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Well, I don't have to learn GJ2. I'll just knock you out.

926
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Okay. How'd that work out, bro?

927
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
But that's a close mind.

928
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
And that's ego.

929
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Thinking, oh, I don't need to learn anything new.

930
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I have all the answers.

931
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Oh, I got that uppercut.

932
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Son.

933
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And no, look, I love boxing.

934
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Boxing is an awesome form of self defense

935
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
that everybody should learn out of box.

936
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
You should absolutely learn out of box.

937
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
There's two, you know, your fists are great weapons.

938
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You should also learn more about it.

939
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
You should also learn wrestling.

940
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Because you got to be able to.

941
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
So you see where I'm going with this.

942
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But there was a time where

943
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
strikers, boxers, kickboxers would say, oh, I don't need to learn GJ2.

944
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Because I'll just knock you out.

945
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And that was just arrogance and ego.

946
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And part of it is also might have been just ignorance.

947
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Not just arrogance, but ignorance.

948
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yeah.

949
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Because, because, because you think, oh, someone's going to charge it.

950
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Me, I'll just knock him out.

951
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And I think that's what I think.

952
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And that's what I think.

953
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And that's what I think.

954
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And that's what I think.

955
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And that's what I think.

956
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And that's what I think.

957
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
And you're going to charge it.

958
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Me, I'll just knock him out.

959
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Yeah, man, it's so much harder than you think.

960
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Yeah, I'm sure there was a lot to that.

961
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
There was, there's a thing called sunk cost, palace.

962
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Oh, for sure.

963
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
For sure.

964
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So yeah, and that's what Horyn Gracie, one of the good founders of GJ2.

965
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
That's what he would say.

966
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Where it's like, it's a, it's a painful realization.

967
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
When you realize that you spent 20, sometimes 30 years at this,

968
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
an effortful, just hard work.

969
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Yeah.

970
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
You know, it's hard.

971
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And then without it being proved to you, like, you're not going to admit that it was a mistake.

972
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
You just can't do it.

973
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
You have too much invested in it.

974
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You know, yeah, that was, that was a very, you want to talk about a very hard thing to have happened to you.

975
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Yeah.

976
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Is you've been training whatever martial art, whatever.

977
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And they used this today to use the term traditional martial art.

978
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Yes.

979
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So you've been training a traditional martial art.

980
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Take your pick for 24 years.

981
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And like you said, hard training.

982
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
You've memorized the cada.

983
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
You've done the drills.

984
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
You've done the, the sparring even.

985
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Yeah.

986
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And then, so you're, you're 20 years deep, 25 years deep.

987
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
You've competed even.

988
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
You've competed.

989
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And you've, you've knocked people out.

990
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
And stuff.

991
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And you've won.

992
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
You've been at champ and all these things.

993
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And then all of a sudden someone comes in and says,

994
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
No, that's going to work.

995
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Yeah.

996
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And by the way, it's, it's going to work.

997
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
What I do is going to work 10 times out of 10.

998
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
But that's what, that's what my percentages are.

999
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So you're a, you're a, you're a boxer.

1000
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And how much is your just your guy?

1001
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I'm going to take you down and choke you 10 times in a row.

1002
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It seems unbelievable.

1003
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Right.

1004
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
They go a hundred times.

1005
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Maybe someone gets a, gets a putters chance.

1006
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Someone gets knocked out, right?

1007
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
But I can, I can,

1008
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Law of averages say you're a hundred percent boxer.

1009
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And I'm a jiu-jitsu guy.

1010
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
10 times out of 10.

1011
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So if you, you and I got okay.

1012
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Cool.

1013
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Let's go again.

1014
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
You try and knock me out.

1015
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
You're getting taken down.

1016
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:01.000
You're getting choked.

1017
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Let's go again.

1018
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
You're getting, you try and knock me out.

1019
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
You're going to get take down.

1020
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Choked out.

1021
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
That's what's happening.

1022
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000
So that was a really hard, hard fact to face.

1023
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Yeah.

1024
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And it happened to happen across the country as jiu-jitsu.

1025
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Belts.

1026
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Yeah.

1027
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Blue belts were dough jostormy.

1028
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Like walking into, walking into traditional martial arts studio.

1029
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I'll take anybody in here.

1030
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Yeah.

1031
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And then double leg, double leg, you know, cross side.

1032
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
People even know what the guard was.

1033
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It wasn't like they were getting in the guard.

1034
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
They were just mounting and choking.

1035
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah.

1036
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Yeah.

1037
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
And that was kind of the,

1038
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Especially, I mean, now this is different.

1039
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Cause it totally different.

1040
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Yeah.

1041
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
You know, like, yeah.

1042
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And here's kind of, you know, it's kind of more the same.

1043
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
No, right?

1044
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
We're, we're okay.

1045
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So you look at the UFC, right?

1046
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
The pinnacle of like now it is.

1047
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Like now it is.

1048
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
It's not UFC one is different than UFC now.

1049
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Oh.

1050
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So UFC one was this art style versus style versus this style.

1051
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Actually, you know what, you're right.

1052
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
It wasn't just style versus it was art versus art.

1053
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yeah.

1054
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Because even in jiu-jitsu, we have different styles of jiu-jitsu.

1055
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Yeah.

1056
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So it was literally a jiu-jitsu practitioner against the boxer.

1057
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Right.

1058
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Or a wrestler against an Ikeedo guy.

1059
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Yeah.

1060
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Or whatever.

1061
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
You name it was art against art.

1062
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And they didn't even really calculate the fact that there's a huge difference between

1063
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
somebody that wrestled in high school, somebody that wrestled in college and somebody that

1064
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
wrestled in Olympics.

1065
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Or someone that did jiu-jitsu at the jiu-jitsu club, someone that did jiu-jitsu in college,

1066
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and someone that did jiu-jitsu on the Olympic stage.

1067
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
There's a huge difference between the two.

1068
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
But they didn't really calculate that.

1069
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Yeah.

1070
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Not really.

1071
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
And I guess I'm just maybe speaking on what actually played itself out.

1072
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Right.

1073
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And for you, C1, there was Gracie in action.

1074
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
The Gracie in action tapes.

1075
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Right.

1076
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Which was essentially one and one challenge.

1077
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I have James's James, if you're out there listening right now, have your Gracie in action tapes.

1078
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Sorry.

1079
01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
The James James.

1080
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Where it's like, and if you don't know what that is, what it is essentially,

1081
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
guys would come in doubting this new jiu-jitsu thing.

1082
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
They were like, oh, I would beat them.

1083
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
You know?

1084
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And the Gracie's they would say, yeah, you can come in challenge anyone of our guys or whatever.

1085
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And then after so many people responded to that challenge, they started taping it.

1086
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And they would just beat these guys up.

1087
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Not bad.

1088
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
It wasn't a bully situation.

1089
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
It was literally like to prove to them that, hey, this way is better at fighting.

1090
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
That's it.

1091
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It's not like, yeah, we're going to kill everyone or nothing like that.

1092
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
So just time after time or time.

1093
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And then if you see it, you can see the guy.

1094
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
And this is on a bunch of them too, where the guy would be like, oh, like, almost like he's saying that didn't count.

1095
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Yeah, that's true.

1096
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
But he didn't get it.

1097
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah.

1098
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I have personally experienced that.

1099
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Oh, yeah, that's the common thing.

1100
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Yeah, I was lucky because I was doing GJ2 kind of like legitimately doing GJ2 before it was popular at all.

1101
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Yeah.

1102
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
So I kind of had some of those Gracie and Action experiences where guys were just confused.

1103
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Yeah.

1104
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Like just legitimately.

1105
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And I found that usually three or four submissions before they even start to comprehend what's happening.

1106
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Like the first one they're just baffled.

1107
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
You know, you're going against the rest or you're going against a boxer.

1108
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Ressers would get especially confused because it just didn't make sense.

1109
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Or what just happened.

1110
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Like a boxer, I guess a boxer would be so confused.

1111
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
They're like, wait, what are we doing on the ground?

1112
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
What?

1113
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Why am I down there?

1114
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Is this fighting?

1115
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
This isn't fighting.

1116
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
How can you knock me out when we're, oh, they just, you just got your on bro.

1117
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Or you just got tapped out.

1118
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Resslers would be, it would be confusing to them because they don't even understand how

1119
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
these body positions that they've learned and that they've won.

1120
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And that they seem to have so much control of us on.

1121
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
They're not working and they're getting tapped out.

1122
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
But yeah.

1123
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
So like the first submission is total disbelief.

1124
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
They're like, it's confusion and disbelief.

1125
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And then okay, let's go again.

1126
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Because they think, oh, I, I will keep my, I won't let them grab my own.

1127
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Yeah.

1128
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Exactly.

1129
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And they don't let you grab the arm and then you choke them.

1130
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Yeah.

1131
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And that's how, how boring describes it.

1132
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And then, um, in those, a lot of those videos is, it's like you can't, they can accept it.

1133
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Right.

1134
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
So they're, so they'll be like, oh wait, I just need to go harder.

1135
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Like I, maybe, it was taking me to easy on him.

1136
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Maybe I have to focus a little bit more.

1137
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Yeah.

1138
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Go faster.

1139
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Go harder.

1140
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Yeah.

1141
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Exactly.

1142
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Right.

1143
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Um, but just like I said, if you don't know, you just, if you don't know,

1144
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
you don't know the positions, you just sort on the ground.

1145
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Like you don't know.

1146
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Like even, like the difference between garden and half garden.

1147
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
If you don't know what any of that even is, there's no difference.

1148
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
No, there's no difference in garden mountain.

1149
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Nothing. There's no difference.

1150
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
You will not remember.

1151
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
You have no difference.

1152
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
If you're on the bottom of your remember versus if you're not on the bottom.

1153
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Okay. There is that.

1154
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
But in Gigi to that part doesn't matter as much.

1155
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
It seems like so backwards almost if you know Gigi to versus if you, if you, if you don't.

1156
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
So these guys would be just confused the whole time.

1157
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And then all of a sudden they're getting choked and then if you don't know how it happens,

1158
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
you just like, oh, we just sort of wound up like that.

1159
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
So it seems kind of like a lucky position.

1160
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You fell on the ground.

1161
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
It was a scrambled boy.

1162
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And just like, you know, ended up that way.

1163
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Meaning what meanwhile since they know they knew Gigi to their methodically, specifically placing these guys in this position,

1164
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
then this position, then this position, then they can choke.

1165
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And they do it every like one time after another after another.

1166
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And then finally the guy accepts it.

1167
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
No, and this is back in the Gracian actually this.

1168
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
So you have to see one.

1169
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
You don't have that luxury to be like, hey, let's do it again.

1170
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Yeah.

1171
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
But still nobody knew what was going on.

1172
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
What was happening.

1173
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Now keep in mind the difference between back then and today is back then, no, no, Gigi to that all.

1174
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
They only knew their karate.

1175
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
They only knew their, you know, kickboxing.

1176
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
They only knew their art.

1177
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Now everyone knows everything.

1178
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Yeah.

1179
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
It's totally.

1180
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
In one way or another, like if you say, hey, show me mount.

1181
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Probably because of course mount.

1182
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
That's basic.

1183
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Everyone knows their mount.

1184
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I don't think this can be literally a karate guy.

1185
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Yeah.

1186
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Like remember Leo to Machita, right?

1187
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
When I was like, oh, see, karate does work and all the karate guys were like,

1188
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
yeah, for we were saying this for years, we always knew karate or

1189
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
the brother Leo to Machita's back.

1190
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Yeah.

1191
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And he's probably black, well, leveling up a bunch of other things.

1192
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
You know, so it's just a different landscape.

1193
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
That's not the proving ground from four art versus art anymore.

1194
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Yes.

1195
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
It's different.

1196
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Well, even I just made people mad just now.

1197
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Three minutes ago when I said, well, a boxer against the G, there's still some people out there

1198
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
that are like, bro, just knock this dude out.

1199
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
He came in on me.

1200
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
There's still people like that right now, even having the, the incredible vast source of knowledge.

1201
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And again, I love boxing.

1202
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Everyone should train boxing.

1203
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
100% boxing is a brutal martial art.

1204
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And it's an incredible martial art.

1205
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
But if you're a pure boxer and you're going up against the G,

1206
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
you're going to get choked out.

1207
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I regret to inform you.

1208
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
So here's the thing.

1209
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
This is why I talk about opening up your mind.

1210
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Because even when you choke someone, their mind doesn't want to open up.

1211
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Then you unlock them.

1212
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Their mind doesn't want to open up.

1213
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Then you foot lock them.

1214
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Their mind still, but they're still thinking like what you're saying.

1215
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
They're still like, no.

1216
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
They're mind.

1217
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
This is such a good example of how people's minds,

1218
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
how all of our minds wants to be closed.

1219
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Because our ego is keeping it shut.

1220
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
We want to be in that safe area.

1221
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
We've got the sunk costs and what we've already done and what we already believe.

1222
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
And that is a problem.

1223
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It's a problem for the world.

1224
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
So what we have to do and I've been explaining this to people,

1225
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
at S.L.M.Fron, I've been explaining this to people.

1226
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
We actually have to pry open our minds.

1227
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
We have to pry open our minds.

1228
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
You have to force yourself to listen.

1229
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
You have to force yourself, not just to listen,

1230
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
but to actually hear what other people are saying.

1231
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
You have to force yourself to consider other ideas.

1232
01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And honestly, the way that I force myself to consider other ideas is I want to use your idea.

1233
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
That's my goal.

1234
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
My goal is I want echo to be right.

1235
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
When echo says, hey, I've got a plan for how to do this,

1236
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
my goal is to say, that sounds good.

1237
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Let's use your plan.

1238
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
How can I help you make this work?

1239
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
When my subordinate comes to me with a plan and says, hey,

1240
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
jockel, this is what I think we should do.

1241
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
My goal is to use it.

1242
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000
When you present an idea to me about politics or music or a video,

1243
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000
my goal is to say, okay, how can I be on board with what you just said?

1244
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
How can I support you?

1245
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And that's what I do to try and pry my brain open

1246
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000
because our minds are naturally closed and they are closing.

1247
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
So even when your mind gets open up a little bit,

1248
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
it's still trying to close back up.

1249
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
That's what it's trying to do.

1250
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It's pride opening it closes back up.

1251
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That's what it's trying to do.

1252
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
We have to work very hard to pride open and then keep it open to new ideas.

1253
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
You know, like we in regards to like,

1254
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
we using the other person's plan or like pursuing that as a way.

1255
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000
How does that, oh, should I say, how does that just a,

1256
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
you know, because you know how sometimes it again,

1257
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I'm thinking about maybe with your friends when you're young or with your wife or something.

1258
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And so I say, hey, what are we doing for dinner or where are we going to go eat?

1259
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And then I say, I don't know where do you want to go?

1260
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I don't know where you want to go.

1261
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
You get that scenario to happen sometimes, right?

1262
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
So how do you reconcile using the other person's plan in general versus

1263
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
making the decision yourself kind of a scenario?

1264
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
You know, I mean, look, just like anything, there's a back caught of me.

1265
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And if I say to my wife, where do you want to go to for dinner?

1266
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And she says, I don't care where do you want to go?

1267
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And I say, oh, I'm actually open for anything.

1268
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I had a late lunch or not that hungry.

1269
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
And I know you have an eating today.

1270
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So whatever you want, it's good with me.

1271
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And then she says, no, I, you make the call.

1272
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Right.

1273
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I mean, how long may you do that for?

1274
01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
First, I say, cool.

1275
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Sounds like we're going to raglands.

1276
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Right.

1277
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
And then she's going to go, I didn't want that.

1278
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Okay, cool. What did you want then?

1279
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I actually wanted whatever.

1280
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
So would it be, in a based off that hypothetical scenario, would it be actually even

1281
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Wiser to have not just maybe like three to four different options?

1282
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Maybe pre contemplated that kind of follow her into just a little bit too.

1283
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Yeah.

1284
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Yeah.

1285
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:34.000
You know, you can, you can, she's wanting to make you feel like it was your call.

1286
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
So then you just say, hey, how about we go to whatever.

1287
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
The place that you know she likes and she goes, oh, okay, that'd be great.

1288
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Cool. What did I, we're good?

1289
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Yes.

1290
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
No big deal.

1291
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:44.000
So let me go on.

1292
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Because I feel like I'm going to read that much into this.

1293
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
What don't I don't make this into that big of a deal?

1294
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Well, I feel like it kind of can be sometimes.

1295
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
That's the thing.

1296
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
It definitely can be.

1297
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
And not so much the restaurant thing.

1298
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I'm saying in general.

1299
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000
So like, you know how, okay, so here's the commenting in my household,

1300
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
where, you know, it becomes four,

1301
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
thirty, five o'clock.

1302
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Right. So here comes Mrs. Charles saying, hey, what are you thinking for dinner?

1303
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Now, usually that's your jam usually she kind of, hey, I'm thinking this for dinner.

1304
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I'm always pretty much always like good, you know why?

1305
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Because I don't have any preference. I don't want to make that decision.

1306
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I'm thinking about other stuff to be honest.

1307
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Is it a big deal?

1308
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
No, it's not a big deal.

1309
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
But I am thinking about this stuff.

1310
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Yeah.

1311
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
It makes it a lot easier for my brain.

1312
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
His feet wasn't maybe to not have to make that decision.

1313
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Right.

1314
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Now, I do understand that sometimes she's in that same boat too,

1315
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
because she was thinking about a lot of stuff and sometimes not all the time.

1316
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Actually, not mostly time, but sometimes she doesn't want to make that decision as well.

1317
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
She'll make that dinner.

1318
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Yeah.

1319
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
But she doesn't have to think something up that everyone's going to like, and I understand.

1320
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Right.

1321
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So that's the thing.

1322
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
It can be a thing.

1323
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
So sometimes people do just want you to make the decision.

1324
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Cool.

1325
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
You make one.

1326
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
See, no big deal.

1327
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Yeah.

1328
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
That's what I was saying.

1329
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
You got to tell me.

1330
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
You got to tell me.

1331
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
You got to tell me.

1332
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I hate to go this hard to spread this much time, but like,

1333
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
if my wife says to me,

1334
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
well, no where do you want to go?

1335
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Yeah.

1336
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And I say where I actually want to go.

1337
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Yeah.

1338
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And she doesn't want to go there.

1339
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I'm going to just look at her face and be like, Oh, that's a bad call.

1340
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
So I'm probably going to say, actually, I feel like going to name one of her three

1341
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
favorite restaurants and then we're going to go.

1342
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
There you go.

1343
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
But then take some pre-contemplation.

1344
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I don't know.

1345
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I really don't have like a bunch of different restaurants.

1346
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And you're either one of us doesn't have some big list.

1347
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
You know, some good to look at.

1348
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:42.000
The funny thing about my wife is she'll be like, she'll, she'll stray from the,

1349
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
from the lesson learned, which the lesson learned to me is the lesson learned to me is,

1350
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I'm going to a restaurant that I already know that I already know.

1351
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I'm going to get what I already know.

1352
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Like, that's what I'm doing.

1353
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Yeah.

1354
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I'm going to the restaurant that I know.

1355
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I'm going to get what I already know.

1356
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000
My wife will sometimes wish he needs a re-learning lesson, which is, oh, she want to try this new place.

1357
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
So I'm going to a new place with her.

1358
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000
And then as soon as she takes her first bite of the main course, she's looking at me like lesson learned again.

1359
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Right?

1360
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Because that's face it.

1361
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Now occasionally, do you find a winner?

1362
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Like a certain restaurant to put in the mix?

1363
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Sure.

1364
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Can find that new restaurant to put in the mix?

1365
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
What is that word?

1366
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
What do you mean?

1367
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
What do you mean?

1368
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
That's what I'm saying, whatever, like that's not true. Because it's probably true.

1369
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
But I'm saying, what do you mean it's probably true?

1370
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It is.

1371
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
How often do you go to restaurant?

1372
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
You're like, oh, wow, put this one in the mix.

1373
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Me?

1374
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I don't know.

1375
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I don't know.

1376
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
But that's true.

1377
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
You just be going 100 to restaurants.

1378
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
You have a list of 100 to restaurants that you be going to all the time.

1379
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Because every restaurant you go to, just in the mix now.

1380
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Yeah.

1381
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
To me, all sushi restaurants with the exception of two are in the mix.

1382
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Yeah, it's true.

1383
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
But my point is, is it the whole gone, hold on.

1384
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
There is there a hierarchy?

1385
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Yes.

1386
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
See?

1387
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
So why would you not go on a top three to five at the most?

1388
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Oh, there's, there's the hierarchy isn't based on like how good it is.

1389
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Oh, then it's based on other stuff.

1390
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
It's based on the house.

1391
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Exactly.

1392
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Delivery, maybe some price scenarios and all this stuff.

1393
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
That's how the hierarchy is based.

1394
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Okay. So the hierarchy's there.

1395
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
So why are you playing around online?

1396
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Because that's not the point.

1397
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
The point isn't what I do specifically.

1398
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
That's the only way.

1399
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
You do specifically.

1400
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Because we're both in unique situations.

1401
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I think I'm saying, generally, it is.

1402
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000
You don't think there's other dudes out there that go out for dinner with her wife.

1403
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Sometimes that makes us unique.

1404
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Oh, that part is unique.

1405
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Okay. What's unique?

1406
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
The part that you freaking, you got to wonder,

1407
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I'm sure on in your wife is that certain way that's,

1408
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I think the typical person is more to it than that.

1409
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
That's what I think.

1410
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
You know, I know that I'm not normal.

1411
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Right?

1412
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I know.

1413
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
So I know that it's not normal to just be like,

1414
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Oh, I want to go to the same three restaurants over and over again.

1415
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And get the same exact food by the way.

1416
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I do the same thing.

1417
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
There's so rare that I have the,

1418
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I can't even remember the last time I fought to myself.

1419
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Oh, it'd be great to go out and try something new.

1420
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Okay.

1421
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
So there's probably some psychologists doing an assessment right now as I'm talking and figuring out,

1422
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
like, oh, he's got fear of whatever.

1423
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
And I don't think so.

1424
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I think I just, when I'm going to go out and I'm going to invest,

1425
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
like, I don't want to get in the car.

1426
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I don't want to drive somewhere.

1427
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I don't want to go wait.

1428
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I don't want to put on shoes or whatever.

1429
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Yeah, rather just be careful.

1430
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Yeah, rather just be careful.

1431
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Careful, right?

1432
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
So why are we doing this?

1433
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Well, we're doing this because whatever.

1434
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It's, it's a good night.

1435
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
You know, my wife doesn't feel like whatever.

1436
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
We didn't, whatever.

1437
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
She doesn't feel like whatever.

1438
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Okay.

1439
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So we're going to go out somewhere.

1440
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
So I'm going to go somewhere that I know.

1441
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Yeah.

1442
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
That's cool.

1443
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And I get something that I already know.

1444
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I could feel you for him.

1445
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
It's unusable for the typical person is what I'm saying.

1446
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Hey, let me ask you this because I don't eat sushi.

1447
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
How much variance is there in one of the sushi quality?

1448
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Yeah.

1449
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Yeah, big variety.

1450
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
So bro, how can you say that you're not like you got your top three?

1451
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Because the variance, I don't care that much about you.

1452
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Okay, how often are you like, oh cool.

1453
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
There's another one over here.

1454
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Let's go, let's go order from that one.

1455
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
We've never been to before.

1456
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Not for the purpose of that it's new.

1457
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So I agree with you in that scenario.

1458
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000
But this is what I am saying, though, where let's say, okay, have you ever heard of the

1459
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
concept, the idea?

1460
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And then you have, by the way, of someone's a head of the way.

1461
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Someone's, hey, let's try something new.

1462
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Hey, we always go there.

1463
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
That's why it's all right.

1464
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
That's my wife all day.

1465
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
That's a lot of people's wives.

1466
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And that's my point.

1467
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
So sometimes they want to try something new.

1468
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
But sometimes they don't want that beef over that decision.

1469
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
They want you to make the decision.

1470
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Oh, yeah.

1471
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
So sometimes just for the, just for the sake of it,

1472
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
just to get some leadership capital going.

1473
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Yes.

1474
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Hey, let's try something new.

1475
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
We went to a joint the other day that was new.

1476
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I know what?

1477
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
It was all, by what?

1478
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
My wife was all excited.

1479
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And we did, like we got in a car.

1480
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
It drove somewhere.

1481
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Okay.

1482
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And she was, he, he, man.

1483
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he.

1484
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Everybody's all excited.

1485
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
So, see what he, he, he, he, on this, right?

1486
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And I'm like, okay, so we went up there.

1487
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And we got in there.

1488
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
It was like, it was, uh, it, and it was fine.

1489
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And now we're driving back after finding parking.

1490
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
After driving up there, finding parking.

1491
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Getting sat down, you know, figuring out the menu and, and you were driving, now we,

1492
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
now we drive home.

1493
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
And I'm like, do you ever want to go back to?

1494
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
She's like, no.

1495
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Yeah.

1496
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
So think about that.

1497
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
But that doesn't mean that it was, it's a bad way to think.

1498
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Venture.

1499
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Right.

1500
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
So basically, you're hitting me.

1501
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
What you're hitting me with is I need to open my mind.

1502
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:40.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's true.

1503
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
You should use that as a flank.

1504
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
It was like me, right?

1505
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Tell me, Jocco, you know what you just need to open your mind.

1506
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
You need to pry your brain open and get some more different food.

1507
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Okay.

1508
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Well, I, at this point of my life, I'm very uncomfortable telling you what you should do to.

1509
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I need help.

1510
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I'll call.

1511
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
They know my phone number.

1512
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I'm sure.

1513
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I said, I want this.

1514
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I want this one.

1515
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And they're like, yeah, like, they know like, oh, no, keep it.

1516
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Come on.

1517
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
They, they know the thing.

1518
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
In fact, there was a new girl there.

1519
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
She's not doing anymore.

1520
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Mm-hmm.

1521
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Shout out to Jocelyn, by the way.

1522
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Um, and she'd be like, oh, uh, she took my order.

1523
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Got it wrong.

1524
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
The sushi chef got it right on his own.

1525
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Mm-hmm.

1526
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
That's how, saying like, you made it.

1527
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
No, we're all because of that.

1528
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
But he said that with a lot of pride, bro.

1529
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
You're like, oh, a lot of pride.

1530
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
That is not the point.

1531
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
The point is, I'm with you on the whole.

1532
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I go the same spot and get the exact same thing every single time.

1533
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
100%.

1534
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000
My question was with you answered by the way with your, your, uh, your anecdote is sometimes.

1535
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
You sure, as a tradition, not traditional.

1536
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
As a silent leader, you want to go with the other person's plan.

1537
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
But sometimes they don't want that beef of you coming coming up with a plan.

1538
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
So you're going to have to plan the plan.

1539
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
If I can't, and it better not be the same exact plan sometimes.

1540
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
But she's the thing.

1541
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
My wife knows that if she asked me for a plan, she knows what we're going.

1542
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Where is going to, you know, we're in a raglan.

1543
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
What up?

1544
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
But hey, here's the other thing.

1545
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
We already talked about this.

1546
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I have to calculate the emotions in the situation.

1547
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Yes sir.

1548
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So if my wife's like, oh, you know, it's been a long week.

1549
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I really just want to do something nice tonight.

1550
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
You know what that means?

1551
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Yeah, I mean, she wants to like go to somewhere.

1552
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Maybe we haven't been for big risk for me.

1553
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Yes sir.

1554
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I know it.

1555
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I got to calculate my my emotions, which can be controlled.

1556
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Her emotions, which I can't control.

1557
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:47.000
But also, but also, but also, but also, I'm going to look at it and say, oh, my wife is probably going to be excited if we go to a new venue that we haven't been before.

1558
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So she's going to be, it's going to be a positive emotion for I put that in the calculus.

1559
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I also have to put in the calculus.

1560
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Like, I had my week was good.

1561
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I'm not that busy.

1562
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Whatever.

1563
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Okay cool.

1564
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I got some time tonight.

1565
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I'm not going to be mad.

1566
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
So cool.

1567
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Oh yeah, it's a good night to roll down there.

1568
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And also, if the calculus is, my wife's going to be super happy.

1569
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
And I'm going to be super angry.

1570
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
That's no factor.

1571
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Because I can just be like, cool.

1572
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I'm just going to enforce myself to have a good time and no factor.

1573
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
So I'm not going to, I'm not going to let it dictate, but I have to calculate the emotions on both sides.

1574
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
My emotions in the calculus, barely count.

1575
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I'm going to say that again.

1576
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
My emotions in the calculus barely count.

1577
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
And I don't hold the grudge.

1578
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I don't mope around that night.

1579
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I don't go to restaurants and say, see, I told you, no.

1580
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
My emotions barely count.

1581
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
What counts is my wife's emotions.

1582
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Or my employees' emotions.

1583
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Or my boss' emotions.

1584
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I have control over my emotions.

1585
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Therefore, they have very little, little say in the calculus.

1586
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I think I get it now.

1587
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
For real. Okay. Okay.

1588
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
It's correct me from wrong.

1589
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Because it's pretty, if I got this correctly, I'm talking out and make sure I got it.

1590
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
That was pretty genius.

1591
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I think what you just kind of demonstrated.

1592
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Okay. So in my scenario, I put that up anyway.

1593
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Where?

1594
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
My wife wants to go somewhere new.

1595
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
But she doesn't want to think about where to go.

1596
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
She doesn't want to make the decision.

1597
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
She doesn't want to figure it out.

1598
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
She wants me to go.

1599
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Even though I might not even want to go somewhere new.

1600
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Or maybe I do, but I'm for sure.

1601
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Now, don't they just go one level deeper?

1602
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That's too conflicting.

1603
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Plans right there.

1604
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Isn't it? Because her plan is do something new without having to make the decision.

1605
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
That's the plan.

1606
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Okay.

1607
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
So it's like, hey, let's go with that plan.

1608
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
As opposed to my plan would be like, no, we'll go to the same spot.

1609
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Or no, I don't want to go.

1610
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
That would be my plan.

1611
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Okay.

1612
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:41.000
So essentially, you just went one level deeper where the decision to make the decision is part of the plan.

1613
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
That's the decision.

1614
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Yeah.

1615
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Exactly.

1616
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
So you go with the plan.

1617
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I'm making a decision on a new place.

1618
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I'm making a plan.

1619
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Yeah.

1620
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
So it's a win-win.

1621
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
That's what we're doing here.

1622
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Yeah.

1623
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Yeah.

1624
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Yeah.

1625
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
That's like coming to the top of the scene.

1626
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
That stuff all works out at the end.

1627
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
That's the way it all is it's all a unified theory.

1628
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
It's a unified, you know what a unified theory is?

1629
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
It's like a theory of everything.

1630
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Yeah.

1631
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
All the stuff that I'm talking about.

1632
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
It's a unified theory.

1633
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And if you pull the thread on it, it'll be like, oh.

1634
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Yeah.

1635
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
So you are executing her plan.

1636
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
That her plan was to have you come up with the plan.

1637
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Okay.

1638
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
So let me just add a new restaurant.

1639
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
This is me echo telling you, Jocco this.

1640
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Oh, um, the member, how I said like the number one most valuable thing, not the only one.

1641
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
The number one most valuable thing, not the only one.

1642
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000
The number one most valuable thing that I learned from the, essentially, the long game versus the short game and how that's in play.

1643
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Okay.

1644
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000
So the updated version of that, which happened to a while ago as well, which it might be just more of the same really.

1645
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
But basically it goes like this, a more unified expression.

1646
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I'll say.

1647
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.000
In life and everything you do, whatever pretty much, there's going to be a short game being played and a long game being played.

1648
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Most people that default to the short game, for sure.

1649
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
But it's going to be short game.

1650
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
There's going to be long game.

1651
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
There's also with everyday interactions with everything you do.

1652
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
There's going to be a small picture.

1653
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And then there's going to be a big picture.

1654
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
And I think that bigger picture, like that was an example of like just look at it one level bigger.

1655
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
It's like, you can't, we're not going with her plan to what restaurant it is.

1656
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
The decision for the restaurant is part of her plan.

1657
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Yeah.

1658
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Yeah.

1659
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And just just kind of FYI, saying the big picture and saying long term and saying strategy versus attackers.

1660
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
All those are interchangeable.

1661
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Not completely interchangeable, but essentially interchangeable.

1662
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
They're different ways of saying the same thing.

1663
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I mean, when I would talk to one of my guys, I might not say, hey, think about this from a strategic perspective.

1664
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
I might say, hey, you've got to think about the big picture.

1665
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
And I'm not saying a bigger map, right?

1666
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I'm saying over the longer term.

1667
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000
So you're right that it's a different way of expressing the same thing.

1668
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And maybe we could find some nuance.

1669
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Maybe we will find some nuances on the paid picture versus the long term versus the strategy.

1670
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000
But essentially, they're all meeting the same thing and they're all a good place to focus.

1671
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:23.000
And, you know, with that, these are things that we're talking about to apply to really everything that you're in your life,

1672
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:31.000
from picking restaurants, to picking employees, to picking plans, to figuring out where you're going to go in six months and a year.

1673
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
And a year and two years to figure out what you're doing with your own personal health.

1674
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
To figure out everything.

1675
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And in order to do that, you have to detach that is the first step that you got to take.

1676
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Don't get emotional.

1677
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Listen to what people have to say.

1678
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Keep your damn ego in check.

1679
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
It's there.

1680
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
The hardest thing about the ego is you don't know it.

1681
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
It's like the air that you breathe.

1682
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
There and you don't recognize it until you go, oh, hold on a second.

1683
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
If you start to inhale something that stinks, then you notice it.

1684
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Other than that, you don't really notice it.

1685
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
That's what's going on with your ego.

1686
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
So you've got to be careful of it.

1687
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And then keep that mind open.

1688
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Because that's where you get the new ideas and that's where you figure things out.

1689
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And if you do that when you detach, then your ability to see.

1690
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Will increase exponentially.

1691
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
You can't.

1692
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:37.000
It's like if you didn't have you had bad vision.

1693
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
And one day you put on glasses.

1694
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And you could see.

1695
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Like that is.

1696
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Or you know, one day you're walking around you put some dirty,

1697
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
chipped up sunglasses on that were old and crappy.

1698
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
And you have sunglasses like that.

1699
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I got some sunglasses like that. And you're just wearing them because it's sunny out or whatever,

1700
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
but there's nothing really that you're doing is cruising.

1701
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
But then all of a sudden, some happens where you need to see.

1702
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And you lift up those glasses and everything comes real clear.

1703
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
That's like what detachment does.

1704
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
It's it's an amazing.

1705
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
It's a superpower.

1706
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And it gives you an amazing advantage in everything that you do.

1707
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
So.

1708
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Detach it, everybody.

1709
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
That's what we got for you.

1710
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Echo.

1711
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
It's a good way for us to get our minds right.

1712
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
What else do we want us to need to think about here?

1713
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Our bodies.

1714
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Oh, check.

1715
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
They're broke my foot.

1716
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I don't know if it's broke.

1717
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
But it seems broke.

1718
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
You're wearing a funny shoe.

1719
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Yes, called a post-op shoe.

1720
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
But you didn't get up.

1721
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
No, up.

1722
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Just the shoe.

1723
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Okay.

1724
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I think it was like a turf tow gone wild morphed into more injuries.

1725
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Because I've been doing a barefoot kind of scenario.

1726
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
You know, you work out like explode into your foot and stuff.

1727
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I hear good things.

1728
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And it was working out for me.

1729
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Until.

1730
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Well, that was the end.

1731
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Until I was doing burpees on the cement going hard.

1732
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
So you know when you drop the, you know, burpees, you can do them differently.

1733
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
But I do the kind of where like, they're almost like sprails, but I don't sprawl

1734
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
and my hip or not.

1735
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
It's just on my hand hands and feet.

1736
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
That's it.

1737
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Nothing else touches.

1738
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
So it's like there's some pressure.

1739
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Yeah.

1740
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
The pressure.

1741
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Barefoot cement boom.

1742
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Hurts.

1743
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
No problem.

1744
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Was it one impact you like out?

1745
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
So it was the hole.

1746
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
The next day I was like, let it work.

1747
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Yeah.

1748
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
So the next day I was jammed up.

1749
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
But I could still do barefoot squats and then the next.

1750
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And actually wasn't right.

1751
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
The next day it was like maybe a day or two later.

1752
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And bro, the next day after that, I was couldn't walk and my foot ballooned up.

1753
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
And I wouldn't go away, bro.

1754
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Anyway, I'm jammed up a little bit.

1755
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
But it does focus your brain on alternative stuff.

1756
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
No.

1757
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
What's the what you've been focused on?

1758
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
The nutrition element.

1759
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
The nutrition element.

1760
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
The nutrition.

1761
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
So it's a big deal.

1762
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
It helps with healing way more night and day, by the way.

1763
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
And sleep.

1764
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Oh, but yeah.

1765
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
So yeah.

1766
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Boom.

1767
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
That's what's going on with me.

1768
01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Mm-hmm.

1769
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Because I know you're wondering about that.

1770
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Anyway, so.

1771
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:12.000
There is such thing as exploring just nutrition, but supplementation can be just as important.

1772
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
What's that percentage of people throw out like on on on nutrition versus exercise?

1773
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Like you can't outwork a bad diet.

1774
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Yes.

1775
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I believe that that's a good.

1776
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Except for when you're 18 or 19 or 20 years old and you're going through buds.

1777
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
You could outwork all day.

1778
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
You can't really eat everything.

1779
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Oh, freaking buds.

1780
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Yeah.

1781
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
You can't.

1782
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
How do you to buds scenario?

1783
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
It's not how.

1784
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Yes.

1785
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Need to get your grub on.

1786
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Yeah.

1787
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Let me send that's what you need to do.

1788
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Yeah.

1789
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
So if you want to help yourself out, get some milk.

1790
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Get something which is a protein dessert.

1791
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Really.

1792
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Yeah.

1793
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
All of my things being considered.

1794
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
In my case, it was additional joint warfare, additional supercure oil.

1795
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
That was my protocol.

1796
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Mulk.

1797
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I have been going heavy on the milk.

1798
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
It does actually.

1799
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
It jammed me out only with cardio stuff.

1800
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
What?

1801
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Oh, the food.

1802
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
The food.

1803
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Yeah.

1804
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
So I'm still going hard on the mockest at the point there.

1805
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Did you see that little video I posted of the new factory down in North Carolina?

1806
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Yeah.

1807
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
What was your thoughts?

1808
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
What on the video of that new factory?

1809
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I know that the video is freaking amazing.

1810
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Yeah.

1811
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
That's your assessment of your video.

1812
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Yeah.

1813
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I don't want you to sit here and be like, well, you know, you're angry on this.

1814
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I'm angry.

1815
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Yeah.

1816
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I can add it to the meaty eye.

1817
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Yeah.

1818
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Yeah.

1819
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Well, no.

1820
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I don't want your professional assessment of the video there for you.

1821
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Yeah.

1822
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
So I watch.

1823
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Yeah.

1824
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
So I think I'm, so there's this guy named Jake Tran.

1825
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000
He's a guy who makes these really cool little mini like documentary on us on YouTube.

1826
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
And he talks about like conspiracies and money and corruption and stuff.

1827
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
It's really interesting.

1828
01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Jake Tran.

1829
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000
And so I had going to rabbit holes every once in a while with his videos.

1830
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.000
So a lot of times he'll talk about things like foreign corruption or like, that's where I got the,

1831
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
actually it might have been from one of these videos.

1832
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I'm not sure if we get it.

1833
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
But we're about to express you know, uniquely priced labor.

1834
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Okay.

1835
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:26.000
So you get like, you know, and I get it, man, you want to, you know, buy something kind of cheaper and bring it, you know, and sell it for more.

1836
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Right.

1837
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
And a lot of times part of that discounted price is slave labor.

1838
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
The cost of making it.

1839
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Exit slave labor is exactly right.

1840
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000
You know, do we do they say that when you're making your order from China or whatever, do they say, hey,

1841
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
you know, like here's all your list items.

1842
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Oh, labor.

1843
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Uh, ten cents a day.

1844
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
You know, like it doesn't say that kind of stuff.

1845
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
So it's kind of out of sight on a mind that's facing.

1846
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000
But yeah, so when I watch your video on a lot of videos, actually the originates to these stuff, it kind of like goes to show like,

1847
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Okay, it creates this bigger picture in your mind about what's really going on.

1848
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Like you don't.

1849
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.000
That guilt and I'm not saying everyone feels guilty about slave labor in other countries.

1850
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
But when you think about it, man, it does weren't some guilt as far as feelings go.

1851
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Yeah, for sure.

1852
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:19.000
So yeah, when you see like how you guys, you know, origin in that video and a lot of other videos, it kind of, it does make me think about that a lot more.

1853
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Yeah, and you know what else is an interesting thing to think about is the environment.

1854
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I was watching something else.

1855
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I was watching Rogue in the other day and I figured who have on, but they were talking about seeing the.

1856
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Rivers are like a river in China and it's dyed blue.

1857
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:46.000
It's like blue from making denim and they just dump the chemical right into the river and you can't live there because it's so awful and polluted.

1858
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000
And so yeah, that's why that's why we're doing this man.

1859
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
That's why we're doing this.

1860
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
So and it was cool.

1861
01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:01.000
The thing I liked about showing that factory and that was my first time getting to that factory and the thing I liked about showing is I think it's a good opportunity for people.

1862
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Oh, oh, I people are starting to understand what we're doing, why we're doing it, knowing that it's good for the workers.

1863
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Good for America, good for the environment, good for you as a human.

1864
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.000
So origin USA dot com, get yourself some gear there and you'll be stoked.

1865
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Oh yeah, so also speak to the guy, jacos store.

1866
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
It's called jacos store.

1867
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
So new stuff on there.

1868
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Discipline equals freedom, good.

1869
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
We got the end of the short locker.

1870
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I talked about this a lot of time, but it is if there's some cool, if you're on YouTube, this is a newer.

1871
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Yeah, well, you know what this is?

1872
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Dead's G. I.

1873
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Yeah, but yeah, so there are a little bit different kind of designs, but you get one every month.

1874
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And if you can see the layers, I think that adds to the to the experience.

1875
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And see the hype. Oh yeah, what's our jacos store dot com, get some of that.

1876
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Also, we have the jacos underground.

1877
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
We have to have that.

1878
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
We have to have the jacos underground because look, we don't control whatever platform you're listening to this.

1879
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Unless you're listening to it on jacos underground, which you can do, then we don't control the platform.

1880
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
We don't know what they're going to sense.

1881
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.000
So we don't know if they're going to insert ads and force you to listen to an advertisement.

1882
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
So that they can make money in the following.

1883
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
They make money off of us and you.

1884
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
And that's not good.

1885
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
You don't need to do that.

1886
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Don't let them make money off of you.

1887
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Come along.

1888
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
So yeah, we don't and we don't know if they're ever going to just pull us off because they don't like us.

1889
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Because we said something bad about whoever.

1890
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
We said, we don't like slave labor.

1891
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Well, they want to protect slave labor.

1892
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
So they pull us off the platform.

1893
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000
So jacos underground dot com eight dollars and eighteen cents a month.

1894
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
And you get this, what do you do it like additional podcast on there.

1895
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000
And you're talking about things that are, let's say, jacopontcast adjacent.

1896
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
A Jason.

1897
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Life advice in tips.

1898
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
You know what, do you consider this?

1899
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Because this is what I kind of thought, you know, like you'll talk about like a.

1900
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Topic.

1901
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Thought.

1902
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
You were really, it's like a book called Deep Thoughts.

1903
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
It's more of a comedy book.

1904
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
The joke.

1905
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Yeah, it's like I think from a certain amount of life, right?

1906
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Yeah, and then there's a book.

1907
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
There's an actual book.

1908
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
And it's just, it's that, but it's a bunch of them.

1909
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
And they're pretty like some of them are like, okay,

1910
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
that's funny, but some of them are like, oh yeah,

1911
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
huh, and you know, you kind of, but these a lot of times the beginning of

1912
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
the underground podcast is jacos deep thoughts.

1913
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
That's interesting.

1914
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I didn't really found that.

1915
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I don't know what it is at all.

1916
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I think that when I think the R is like topics that I come across where I think,

1917
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000
you know, that'd be cool to talk about for a half an hour or I learned something

1918
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
that I go, oh, this applies to a lot of different situations.

1919
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I, it's not really jacol podcast, but it's a little underground activity.

1920
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Yeah.

1921
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
So there you go.

1922
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000

You can ask questions about anything.

1933
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
On extreme ownership.com, we have a place to learn leadership

1934

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Like a zoom call.

1937
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
No, that's not like it's a zoom call.

1938
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
If you want to ask me a question directly,

Org also our friend, Micah.

1953
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000
He has an incredible organization taken.

1954
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000
That's out of the wilderness to,

1955
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:29.000
to kind of reawaken their soul.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Don't forget you can find us both on Twitter.

1958
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
On the Instagram, on Facebook.

1959
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Echo's Aquatiles.

1960
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I'm at Jockel Willink.

1961
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
You got to watch out for that. I'll go.

1962
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Algorithm though.

1963
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
It's going to try and grab you.

1964
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
You know another thing, if you want to come and meet up with us,

1965
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
come to the master.

1966
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
We have an event.

1967
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
The next one's in Denver.

1968
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
So if you want to come to the master,

1969
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
you want to hang out.

1970
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
You want to meet.

1971
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
You want to go through some leadership training.

1972
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Once again, go to www.aslamfront.com.

1973
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Check out events.

1974
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And come to one of those live events.

1975
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
People ask me like, oh, are you speaking live?

1976
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And those are those are the events kind of where I speak live.

1977
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
The master, the battlefield.

1978
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
FTXs.

1979
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I go to some of those.

1980
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
So check any of that stuff out.

1981
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000
And of course, thanks to the military troops around the world.

1982
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
We just went through Memorial Day.

1983
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:32.000
And on that day, we remember and memorialize those that made the ultimate sacrifice.

1984
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And we know that all those who signed the dotted line and swore the oath made a commitment

1985
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
to make that sacrifice.

1986
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000
So thanks to all of you out there who made that oath.

1987
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000
And also thanks to our police and law enforcement.

1988
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

1989
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
correctional officers, board patrol, secret service.

1990
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
All first responders, you also signed the dotted line.

1991
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
And so we're two protect us.

1992
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And we are grateful for your commitment as well.

1993
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And everybody else, that's listening.

1994
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:19.000
You can't see what you're doing if you're actually watching yourself do it.

1995
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
If that's the only thing you're watching is what you're doing.

1996
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
You can't see what you're doing.

1997
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
You can't see where you're going.

1998
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
You can't see the impact that you're going to have.

1999
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
You can only see a few inches in front of yourself.

2000
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And you can't make good decisions when you can't see anything.

2001
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:44.000
And you can't make good decisions when you're wound up and your emotional.

2002
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Then you can't be a good leader or a good person.

2003
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:56.000
If you're allowing any of those things to happen and a lot of times what's driving that is your ego.

2004
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
So don't let your ego get out of control.

2005
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Take a step back.

2006
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Relax.

2007
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Look around.

2008
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
And then go get after it.

2009
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
And until next time,

2010
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Zekko and Joko.

2011
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Out.
