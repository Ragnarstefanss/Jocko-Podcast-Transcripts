00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 335 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000 When the Navy's academics had arrived in 1955 to observe UDT training,
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000 their purpose had been to validate the course's individual selection tests, the soft sand runs, the ocean swims,
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000 the harassment of hell week and short of invalidating any of those to develop what they called realistic selection standards,
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000 that would reduce the Navy, what the Navy admitted was the course's excessive attrition.
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000 Subjecting students to a battery of personality tests and classifying their individual traits, age, education, intelligence, and so on,
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000 the academics hoped not only to predict a candidate's likelihood of success in training, but also his success in an actual underwater demolition team.
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000 In the course of these assessments, they learned that students below the age of 21 were 8% more likely to fail.
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000 Roughly the same rate as high school dropouts, while students from broken homes were just as likely to graduate as anyone else.
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000 Based on the number of times a student had voluntarily visited the dispensary, assessors determined that a candidate in moderate health
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000 who, quote, minimized the psychological importance of pain, fatigue, and intense discomfort,
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000 stood a much higher chance of success than, quote, the most physically fit who were overly concerned about their injuries.
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000 The least common traits among successful frog men seemed to be restraint, thoughtfulness, sociability, and cautiousness.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:01.000 The most common were responsibility, emotional stability, original thinking, objectivity, and most of all, masculinity.
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000 Later studies had gone on to test a variety of variables, including the benefits of wheat, German, and a student's diet, which proved particularly negligible,
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000 and a series of raw-shaked tests and psychiatric interviews to determine the effect of sexuality on a candidate's successor failure.
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:32.000 Successful frogman said the sex report's author appeared to require this specific rather masculine and adventurous occupation with all itself destructive and massacistic implications,
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:50.000 because, and this was just the author's speculation of their magical attraction to the depth of the sea and the security of the womb, and an unconscious motivation to prove their masculinity, coupled with a fear of involvement with women.
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000 Setting aside the psychoanalysts tendency to project their own insecurities onto their subject, the Navy had not been able to argue with the UDT's results.
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:13.000 I have never met a group of more self-reliant, hell for leather characters, wrote reporter Bill Stapleton, after accompanying a UDT to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands in 1955.
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:27.000 Besides their typical reconnaissance exercises, submarine lockouts, and tests with minibulled miniture submersibles, the frogman had also salvaged a 50-foot yacht from a reef, twisted the tails of passing sharks,
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:41.000 and when an American sailor had disappeared into a harbor on a moonless night, had commended to truck, roared to the wreath's edge, and as if they had been scouting the contours of an enemy beach dove online until they found the drown man.
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:59.000 In their free time, they spearfished, drank on untold amounts of beer, erected beach-side bonfires, and an overflowing pots of sea water and vinegar, boiled lobsters, and astonished the superstitious natives by broiling barracuda stakes.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:14.000 UE Barracuda Barracuda E.U. they had said, promises reply to frogman, nothing but promises. So exclusive were the UDT said one observer that even rank meant nothing to them.
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:30.000 When seen in their standard swim trunks and knife belts surrounded by charts and diving equipment and asked by passerby's, if they were indeed in the navy, the frogman would invariably reply regardless of the asker's rank.
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000 Nope, we're all in UDT.
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:52.000 So that right there is an excerpt from an incredible book, the book is called by Water Beneath the Waves. It's written by a former seal named Ben Milligan, and it's an outstanding history of where the seal teams come from.
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:16.000 But that little excerpt describing what a UDT man was like back in the day that assessment is from 1955. So at that time there were no seal teams, but the spirit, the soul of the frogman was there in full form, and this is where the modern day seals come from. Those were roots.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:28.000 Those were our forefathers, and it is an honor to have one of those old school frogmen with us today to tell us about his experiences in the underwater demolition teams.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:45.000 What he learned there and how he applied those lessons throughout the rest of his life. His name is Lance Man, a UDT frogman, a waterman, a surfer, an entrepreneur, a lifeguard, and a damn good example of how to live.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.000 Lance, thank you for joining us. Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here. Appreciate it.
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000 That that assessment in 1955, I feel like I know half those guys that if talking about, like these are the guys I grew up with in the teams.
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000 And pretty interesting that it just, there's something about it that stays, like there's something about that old frogman that stays.
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:24.000 Well, I think what the in the training and I guess the buzz if you were all in the subsequent, I don't even know what what all you do to become a sealer.
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:48.000 I hear it's, but I'm always struck by how, how much a part of the old days is is inculcated into the modern day training and in the buzz candidate.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:04.000 And it always catches me off guard. I mean, I love the teams and when I, I always about, I read something like that about five years subsequent to that, to when that was written.
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:27.000 And I think readers digest had a deal in 1961 or something like that. And I was a senior in college and I, as reading that puppy and I said, you know, and I, I didn't really want to go in the military, but I, when I put that down, I said, well, if I have to go in the military, I'm going to do that because that sounds really cool.
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:40.000 And so it, it resonated with me and, and it's interesting to me that it seems like a big part of the seal training.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:08:05.000 Yeah, 100% yeah, and it's, it's a great. I mean, it's an old guy that, when I meet guys and when they hear these guys that could do so much more than I could for crying out loud. And then there being, they're giving me credit for something that, you know, I don't know if I had that in me, but by gum all take it. So, so thank you.
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:17.000 Well, let's, let's, let's get there, let's go all the way back to the beginning to, to where, you know, to where you grew up and how you grew up just to kind of get a feel for where you came from. So when, when were you born?
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:32.000 I was born in, in, in 1939. And, and so my dad, you know, he was, he was a hardworking guy. He just got finished with graduate school.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000 And he was, he was starting his corporate career. And as a consequence, we moved a couple of times.
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000 But then the second world war broke out, he, he signed up with a Navy. He was a navigator.
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000 And, and, I don't, I can't, I don't know what, so you were born in third, 39.
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000 39. Here's your dad, a couple years into his corporate career. Maybe a year or two. Yes. And that was just what guys were doing. Yes.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000 Yes. For more broke out, didn't matter what you were doing. You had a family. You got young kids.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:16.000 Right. You're going. You're going. Or, or, or you, or you were, or you had some occupation where they needed you in it.
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000 And so they didn't want you in the military. They wanted you to keep going with whatever you were doing.
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000 You have any idea why he wanted to go in the Navy? I don't know who I did that. But because of that, we moved everywhere.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000 We lived in Hollywood, Florida. We lived in San Francisco. And we were all over the place. And we must have moved.
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000 And by the time I was about four or five years old, and started going to school, I think I had to went to about five kindergarten.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:56.000 And then, and then about three or four first graduation. And second grade, I went down to one and then third.
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000 And then I went to the same school for third, fourth, and a month and a half of fifth grade.
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000 So moving around the law. And that your dad was in the Navy the whole time?
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:18.000 Is that what you were? Well, everyone, he, he, let's see in 1945, I was six. So I was in first grade,
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000 and that's when the number of schools that I matriculated and kind of tapered down a little bit.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000 And so we settled down. But did he get out of the Navy in 45 after the war?
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:42.000 Yeah, he, he went and he became an administrative assistant to a U.S. senator from New Jersey, that knew him as a young kid going to business school.
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000 And so then we kind of settled down in the DC area for a couple years and then moved to up around New York.
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000 And what were you, what were you into when you were a kid? What were you doing?
00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000 Well, nothing very worthwhile. I, it was one of those deals where you lived in a neighborhood.
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:13.000 And yeah, your baseball team might have 13 guys on it, you know, and that's the way it was growing up and, you know, like a new Jersey in the town outside of New York City.
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000 And then just a bunch of kids getting together doing, doing sports stuff and Porter Park, I remember him on Claire.
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000 And so we did that kind of thing, nothing too organized.
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000 But then, what about by the time you got into high school, which you got to high school?
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:43.000 Well, I, it's funny. I went to a school in Montclair in fifth grade and it was, and I met some good friends there.
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:55.000 And the kids, all my buddies ended up going to, I think it was Montclair Academy for sixth grade.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:06.000 And my parents have, I don't know, you're going to go to Hillside Junior High School instead. So I said, she's okay.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:18.000 So I did, but by the time I was in eighth or ninth grade, it became clear to me why I didn't go to the private school in sixth grade.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000 That's because my parents are probably saving up to send me off to boarding school in New England.
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000 And so I went to high school at Derffield Academy in Western and Massachusetts.
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000 And so that, is that like one of the old school, like all boys, school, co-ntry, co-ntry?
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000 Yeah, no girls. Yeah, yeah.
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000 It was gnarly.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000 But yeah, it was, it was, it was a, it's a great school.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:02.000 And it was probably a lot better school than I was a student, but I think thank goodness for, for swimming, because I joined the swim team.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000 And I, I wasn't a grace swimmer, but I was pretty good.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:15.000 And luckily I had some, you know, so I felt at home at Derffield because of swimming, and not because of the academics too much.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:24.000 I mean, I got through them, but it was a struggle. And I don't think I embarrass my parents, but I got through okay.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000 And this is, so this is the, what late 50s?
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:40.000 It's good. I was there. What in the fall of 54, graduated in 1957, and then went to college in 1958.
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:50.000 Did you have a car? And between, I got a car in 19th, well, no, not until I left Derffield.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000 Okay. Yeah, that was, see, somebody kids, somebody kids, they graduate, and they get a new car.
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000 How was that? It just seemed like cars back then were so epic.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000 Oh, yeah. And even though cars, I think the car, I mean, even today in America, we kind of, we definitely focus on cars,
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000 and that's usually the biggest purchase of a person makes until there may be 30, and they finally buy a house.
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000 But up until then, it's like, what car are you getting? Yep. And back then, it seemed like it was even more so.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000 Oh, he was unbelievable. I remember this guy, Joe Willard, my class, and he was really a neat guy.
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:42.000 And I remember when graduation weekend came along, and he was going down all the neighborhood and Derffield, which is, you know, just kind of a country town kind of a place.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000 And he had this 50 foot long grave.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:15:00.000 And 98, those will build, and there was Joe, man, and it was perfect. He was cruising down there waving and King of the world.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000 Kind of the world. Yeah. Yeah.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:18.000 And I ended up going to two-lane university in New Orleans, and there was a, you know, there was a set of, you know, when you're religious, you know, there's saying,
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000 you know, he got has a plan for you. And so all you need to do is just lighten up and go along with the program.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:49.000 And I certainly didn't have that kind of a spiritual significance inculcated in me at that point. However, you talk about a guy who had no clue what was going on, but somebody must have because when I left Derffield, I think I was the only kid in my class.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:06.000 I had no college, so it was going to take me. And so my parents got me into this great college and was constantly called Lawrence College at the time, and they were good friends with the president of the college. So he says, yeah, okay, yeah.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:32.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, to Mercy admission. So I went there and I turned out that we went down for to to New Orleans because my, I had an aunt that lived there. We went there for spring break, and I looked like they said, I said, there's a college right here, you know, and I sure enough there was a two-lane university.
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:49.000 And luckily, I had an uncle. I was at that time, well, I hate always has always been known for its medical school. And I had an uncle. I was a doctor, and he was pretty prominent around New Orleans.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000 And so he got me in the two-lane, you know, the transfer student.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:03.000 And when you got down to New Orleans, so this is, so now we're talking 50.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000 And a fall of 59.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000 I mean, when you got up to Wisconsin, was that just like cold that you just thought to yourself, I got to get out of Wisconsin?
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:23.000 Well, yeah, and also by this time, my parents had moved there, and I love my parents. We were close and everything, but I've already done time at a boarding school.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000 I was away from home, so living with my parents just wasn't part of the program anymore, you know?
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:38.000 And so I thought, gee, I got to get on my own here. So I, and that really was a big part of going to two-lane.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000 And I was really stoked when you're all in, and the south.
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:55.000 The first time that I went to New Orleans, we were in a seal-patoon, I was a new guy, and we were flying to go to Herbert Field in Florida.
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:03.000 And for some reason, the air crew had had a plan stop from San Diego.
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000 We were flying to, for Robert Field Florida, and for somebody we had to stop for a night in New Orleans, like for some unknown reason, right?
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000 It's a two-lane night. It's a two-lane night.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000 And all the guys were going to the Herbert Street, and I'm thinking it's two-lane night.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000 And of course, I'm not even old enough to drink, so I'm kind of just going along with whatever's going along.
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000 And I thought to myself, well, two-lane, maybe we'll go to some dinner or what, it just wasn't really expecting much.
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000 We got down to Herbert Street on a two-lane night. It was complete and utter mayhem.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000 It was chaos. There was people drinking. Girls taking their freaking clothes off. It was white. It was insane.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000 Wonderful. Yeah. How does that? So was that kind of the gig when you showed up there in 1958?
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000 Was it similar? Was it that much of a party-town back then, too?
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000 Oh, for sure. And I was pretty straight, Errol.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:11.000 And I think I had my, well, I had my first beer, I think, and my freshman year up in Wisconsin and there, and I had great friends in my fraternity there.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000 And so we drank a little bit of beer, but I really had a hondo to a fine art.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:27.000 I kind of knew all of it. Yeah, I knew all of it. I've been around. I moved a lot.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000 And I, about five or six years ago, I was thinking, my favorite city in the United States, it has to be in your own.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:43.000 I was only there for college. And then a few years later, we did some business down there.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000 But yeah, there's something very, very unique about New Orleans.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:57.000 It's wild. So then my, my platoon commander, this was also my first platoon, I think, on our way back or something.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000 We have another weird random stop in New Orleans, but he went to Tulane.
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000 Oh, so he made inroads and we showed up at like a party where some kind of fraternity, I don't even know what it was.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.000 But we show up to this place and you know, it's like a platoon of seals and all these people, all these girls are there. It's just wild.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:31.000 Yes, wild. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I remember for a long time, for a long time, when I was a young single guy, my favorite two cities in America were New Orleans and Lake Tile.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000 Because Lake Tile is also just wild.
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000 Yeah. And yeah, so it was like that in the 50s too, huh?
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:54.000 Oh, for sure. It, and you know, we did, it all the French quarter stuff. And then, but the fraternity parties were a big deal. And yeah, it was pretty wild and crazy.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:07.000 Although I must say it was prime as much of a college experience as it was a city experience, but but we would would spend time downtown in the quarter and stuff.
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:15.000 Usually, you know, if you're doing stuff and then you kind of finish up down the quarter and somehow you get home.
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:23.000 What are you studying when you're going to college? I studied psychology and then minor in English.
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000 And what you do with that with any kind of intent, or is that just sort of like, how it turned out?
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:38.000 Yeah, there was a lot of intent because it looked to me like psychology was probably the easiest subject to figure.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:47.000 And then, tangentially, I started doing the English thing and I minored in that.
00:21:47.000 --> 00:22:01.000 And then I became really interested in school. I read a fair amount. And I remember graduating with a degree in psychology and minor in English.
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:14.000 And I remember, as I, when I started thinking about it, I really wish that I majored in English and then, you know, minor in something else.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:29.000 And then, I called you wasn't, it wasn't as developed as a field of study as it is today to so many people that probably was, but it just, it just didn't reach down to the rest of the world.
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:40.000 As it seems soon now, because my kids have studied at and boy, they're, they're learning things that we didn't even on the map, you know, going through.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:53.000 You know, I kind of wanted major in psychology, partly since it's learning about old, crazy people, but the, when I was reading all these novels and books, there's where the crazy people were.
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000 So I had plenty of that. So so English was was good.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000 And, you know, I'd say that I'd recommend that as a major for anybody.
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000 So as you're going through college, are you thinking you're going to get a job as a psychologist or you, or what, what are you thinking your future is going to be?
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000 Because you said you weren't really that interested in the military at that when you first heard an old.
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:34.000 Oh, no, you don't want to reason. In those days, if you're a guy, a big part of your life from about 16, 17 years old on, as you got to deal with the draft, because if you don't, if you're not proactive with the military, you're going to get drafted.
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000 And you're going to go in the army.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000 Even in 1958?
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000 Yep.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000 Yep.
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000 No kidding.
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000 And so I knew I had, you know, we had Roxy kids in my fraternity, you know, and they do the Roxy deal.
00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:00.000 And so, you know, there was a, I mean, it was an underlying concern or consider, the military was very much a part of your life if you're a guy.
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:11.000 So you're going to have to either be proactive, be going to ROTC or OCS if you want to be an officer or, or get married.
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000 And marriage was, and was kind of a ticket out of avoiding the military.
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000 You know, and I think a lot of guys did that.
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000 I filled with regret all of them.
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000 Yeah.
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000 You know, I mean, you say, you say the military's tough.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000 Take a, how about a wife?
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000 Yeah.
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000 You know, so that.
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000 So yeah, you got it.
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.000 And I thought always could thought that was a bad choice, not a, not forever, but when you're in your 17 18 19 20 year old,
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000 you, it's too early to sign up for that.
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000 So you, you, uh, joining you.
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000 Yeah, I, uh, I knew I had to do something about the military.
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000 And I, I remember talking to some guy who was a pilot, Navy pilot, and I thought, you may be able to be a pilot.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:07.000 And then that article about UDT came up and, and, uh, remember this guy named King Mallory, he was
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000 Sickening, he's going to go into UDT.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000 And we, we were on the swim team at two lane.
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000 And I'll see, you were like a legit goods wherver.
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000 Oh, no, yeah, again, like I say, God had a plan.
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000 We were just starting this swim team.
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000 So we, we could take anybody.
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000 So there, there I was.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000 At two lane and we, we did form the very first swim swim team.
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000 That's a, to lane head.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000 So we, so I guess you made the team.
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000 And I, yeah, well, besides because in order to travel, you had to drive your own car.
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000 And I had a car.
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000 So, so we, um, I made the swim team.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000 And what did this, what did this readers digest article say that really kind of
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000 stood out to you?
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000 And I believe, I believe correct me from wrong.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000 I believe that Admiral Richards talked about the same thing.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000 Wasn't Admiral Richards.
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000 I think it was he also saw a readers digest article and said,
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000 It, it's, I mean, people, my, it's everybody knows about that.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.000 If you're in the teams, uh, I, I'm sure everybody has, is aware of that article.
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000 Whether they read it or not, I don't know, but it, yeah, it was, it was well
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000 known, everybody knows.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000 So what did it say in there that, that struck you as well.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000 One thing, it really sounded like it wasn't very military.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000 He didn't have to be that organized and have to shine your shoes.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000 You know, you didn't have to do all that stuff, which had, that peeled me tremendously.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000 So, uh, and I remember one line in it, and it, um, I didn't, it said that
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:59.000 I, something like this, a, uh, a frogman on the beach in his swim trunks
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:08.000 with his, uh, K bar in his hand, uh, is one of the deadliest weapons in the military,
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000 something like that.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000 And, and that's really dramatic.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000 I think I'm a lie in sync.
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000 Yeah.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000 And, and I, I didn't exactly buy that, but I liked the spirit of it.
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000 And, uh, I think, and as you, and the passage that you read that, there is a spirit of,
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000 uh, you know what, I'm, I'm in the military, I'm part of a group, but I'm, my own
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000 man, I'm, I'm, I'm still who I am, and I'm independent, and you're, you're loyal
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000 to your soul, your loyal to, uh, what you really want to do.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000 And just, it just, it just so happens during this organization where everybody else feels the same way.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000 And if you don't feel that way, you probably won't get through training, you know, there'll be,
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000 so it was, it, it, it, there was something, something rebellious about it.
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000 Here you are going in the military, but yet you're going in, you're kind of backing into it, man.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000 This is, I don't go in the military, but this is how I want to do it.
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000 And I think, I think that was part of the, I think that was part of the,
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000 it's part of the psychology of the, the causes people, at least, it's, it's, it's, it's,
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000 it's, it's, it's, it's what I liked about it.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000 It was like a recruiting poster, a recruiting, yeah, some kind of poster that I think they had
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000 for project Delta and Vietnam, and it was Charlie Beckworth said something along the lines of,
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:41.000 I promise you, medals, or a body bag, or both volunteer here, but I've also seen a similar
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000 thing for UDTs in World War II. I haven't been able to figure out the source of it.
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000 But it was something along the lines of, no KP duty, no uniform, no standing in line
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000 in the childhood, joined the suicide squad UDT.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000 Yeah, it's like a way to recruit guys, man. Young, young guys read that kind of stuff
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000 and they get all kinds of fired up for it.
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000 Sure. And yeah, they have to, they have to want to take a risk too.
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000 Yeah. So what was the process for actually joining, how did your dad feel about you going
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000 to the UDT? Oh, he was so old for it.
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000 100% of the people. Yeah, my dad was, he was a great cheerleader.
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.000 And yeah, he, you know, like, swapping, you know, and he would, he liked a drink a lot too,
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000 and boy, after, you know, it were some cocktail party or something.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000 Boy, you know, by the end of the night, he had me going to the Olympics.
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000 Yeah. Yeah. It was awesome.
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000 But I didn't measure up, but it was, yeah, he, he used all for it.
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000 And did he tell you anything about the UDTs in World War II?
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000 He didn't know. No.
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000 And even when I joined, he didn't, he probably didn't know what the much about him.
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000 He was in the Pacific, and he was in an airplane.
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:18.000 And I, you know, I don't, I mean, the UDTs certainly were made a contribution to the war,
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000 but I don't know if everybody in the military was aware of what all they did.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:32.000 But he was stoked with the, me joining it. He, I think he could see why, why it appealed to me.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000 Instead of, you know, something that's a little more organized.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000 But yeah, he was, he was all for it.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000 I felt like he really was supportive of it.
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000 And then how did you get your commission? Did you go to OCS where you, or were you in ROTC the whole time?
00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:04.000 Well, it's funny. I don't know, I don't know, I'd want to digress anything, but I really didn't know what to do about the military up until about the 10th of September.
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000 And I had, I had a choice of either going six months in the Coast Guard.
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000 And then three, you know, like six years of reserves weekend duty.
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:24.000 Because I was really the easiest way out. You just do Coast Guard. And then you do the reserves, or go up to OCS.
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000 And I said, well, if it's OCS, shit, it's a tenth of a century.
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000 I think they start the 15th. And so I was standing on the courthouse steps there.
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000 And I just about flipped the coin as it came up OCS.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000 So I said, well, fuck, I better get going here because I'm driving in my 1957 Volkswagen.
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000 And so I made it. So that's how I ended up going OCS.
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000 Where was OCS? Was it Rhode Island or was it in Newport?
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000 And when you showed up to OCS, was that run by Marine Corps Jones structures?
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000 No, it was a Navy guy. Oh, how I showed it? Just, it's a good story because it shows you.
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000 I didn't know what the heck I was doing. So I pulled in the parking line.
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:22.000 I had my clothes hung in the back seat of the of my car so that the Volkswagen window was my blue, my
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:30.000 Preppy blue blazer was up against the window. And so I closed the car and I thought, well, I tell you what.
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000 I go, I'll go up park here. Now go in and I'll check into my room and then I need to go into town and get a bite to eat.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000 Well, I go in there. The next time I saw that car was about six weeks later.
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000 And now I'm going anywhere, man.
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000 And so I welcome to the military.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:33:00.000 She, this is, I'm now, I know I never wanted to go in the military. You can't do anything. So I get back out to my car.
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000 My first day of liberty after six weeks. And I was going to put my blue blazer on.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:14.000 However, that portion of the Navy blue blazer that was up against the window had been exposed to the sun for six weeks.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000 And it, and Navy blue blazers exposed the sun that it turns pink.
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000 So I had to have my blazer was pink. So anyhow, that's how that was kind of my introduction.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000 When I realized that, hey, you know what, I'm not in charge of my life anymore.
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000 So that was welcome to the military.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000 Did you know you were going UDT when you went to OCS?
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000 Was it some kind of contract? Was it like pre-designated?
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000 Or did it just tell you you need to take a test or something when you got there?
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000 No, I had no idea. I, I, I, I didn't know it was an option.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000 And I, I think it, it was not an option at that point.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000 And I think you had to do a year in the fleet.
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000 And then you could sign up for UDT.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000 But that was, see, this was getting in towards 62.
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000 And I think whether we knew it or not, Vietnam was cooking up pretty good.
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000 And that's, Kennedy was present.
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000 And so the needs for special warfare was, was, was becoming more paramount at that point.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000 And so during, actually, it was during our class.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000 They opened it up. Hey, if you want to go directly into UDT for OCS, you may.
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000 So I was on that like a tramp on a hot muffler.
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000 I'm sorry. I'm kind of, gift there.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000 So did you take a screening test or something?
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000 Or did you get to, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000 I had a, I think you had a whole breadth of certain length.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000 And then there was another thing that you had to do.
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000 You had to go in a, was in a chamber.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000 And they pressurized you down to 60 feet or something like that.
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000 And I remember that.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000 Um, because I couldn't get my one of my ears to clear.
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000 I wanted to down there.
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000 And, and it just ended up bursting the air drum, but I didn't tell anybody about it.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000 Because I knew then it's one of those great hogs out there.
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000 It's where I did.
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000 So I, I got through it.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000 And they let me in and, and, and, I was really stoked.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000 I could get, you know, to get the, get a chance to go into UDT training.
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000 Was there even any, I'm, I'm going to assume there was no UDT people at OCS.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000 They must have, but did they just look at you like you were crazy guy for one go to that?
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000 Yeah, I was going to go in, I think I was going to go in my class.
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000 I mean, even up until like the 80s officers that were going to be seals,
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000 or kind of like you were, you're, you're capping your career.
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000 Like, oh, you'll make capping, but you're never going to be an animal.
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000 You were just kind of, you were, you were, you were taken like a sideline.
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000 You were taking a side job that didn't really count to the big Navy.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000 So I imagine it in 1962 it must have been just like,
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000 a great point.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000 You know, I rolled in the Coronado, the high, there was UDT 12 and UDT 11 there.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000 And then on the East Coast, there was 21 and 22 I believe.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:24.000 And then the highest ranking officer on the West Coast was a Mustang commander.
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000 And his name was Mac Bointon.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000 And he always smoked a pipe, so we called him Mac the pipe.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.000 And he, he was, and he was a highest ranking guy in the, in the teams.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000 And he was, I think, a second highest ranking person was a, was a lieutenant lieutenant.
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000 And then he ended up becoming a lieutenant commander.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000 And then, yeah, it was, it was a bitchern.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000 I mean, it was just not, it was just, just like, you just read about it.
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:04.000 And it just, it was, it was driving, and then when I was driving up Coronado,
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000 got off the ferry boat, and I was driving up Coronado, and the sun was going down.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000 And he was the, the Coronado, but it wasn't there yet.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000 Not yet.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000 So you're driving up the strand?
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000 No, you drive up in the town and you catch a ferry boat in San Diego.
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000 And had you, had you driven your VW across country?
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000 Yeah.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000 What'd you have a VW bug?
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000 Yeah.
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000 What color was it?
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000 Gold.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000 Gold.
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000 So you drive this thing across country?
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000 Did you do any preparation besides like, hey, you knew how to swim good?
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000 Did you run or anything like this?
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000 Yeah, they, they said running was a big deal.
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000 And I remember, as I drove, I would check in to a hot towel joint.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000 And then I would run about two or three miles and then go to bed.
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000 And then, um, did that.
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000 And then I went, I woke up, I ran a couple of miles.
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000 And go to, and then get going.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000 Uh, yeah, I was, I knew you had to be a fit.
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000 And so I was working on that.
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000 And I had been since I left US, left OCS.
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000 By the way, when I left OCS, I was in my gold coach.
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000 It was February.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000 And, um, snow and, and I was driving through, I remember driving through a whole
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000 mile of all places when John Glenn was going around the world.
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000 Or whatever he did, the epic space flight that he did.
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000 And it was, I was just listening to it on my radio.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000 I was riveted.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000 You know, it was just fantastic.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000 And so that's kind of how I got my start from OCS back to California.
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000 Was OCS done in six weeks or that just when you forgot your first break.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000 When, no, uh, it was done.
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000 Let me see, I started in September.
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000 So we, yeah, was, was October, November, December, January.
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000 It was about a three or four months program.
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000 And, uh, and so in February, I was done.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000 I mean, it was, I was commissioned and I was on the way to,
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000 Cornell.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000 Making that big Navy paycheck.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000 Oh, yeah.
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000 Ritz is guy in the world.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000 Oh, yeah.
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000 I was driving one of the finest cars modern day Tesla, you know.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000 So you certainly driving out your drive out and you eventually get the
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000 Cornell.
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:22.000 Yes.
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000 And you say you take the ferry from where from downtown San Diego.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000 Yeah, in the Coronado.
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000 Yeah, downtown.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000 What is that?
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000 The Seaport Village.
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000 Yeah.
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.000 Yeah.
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000 It is Seaport Village now.
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000 You get off.
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000 And you know, you drive into an AB Cornell.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000 You're looking right.
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000 What, what happens when you check in?
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000 Is anybody even there?
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000 Yeah, there was a Donald Lothon that was the officer on duty.
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000 And then this guy, I forgot the name of the other guy that was working with him.
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000 But yeah.
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000 And he was, again, I was just also
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000 Providential.
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000 I mean, Donald Lothon was this great guy.
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000 He very encouraging.
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000 And he said, hey, you know, it's, it's hard.
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000 But you're going to do fine.
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000 You know, and, you know, a lot of, and, you know,
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000 I could have run into some guys who knew, oh, man, you're going to.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000 But this guy, he was, maybe ended up being a good friend.
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000 And was he, so he was he in Buds or he was already in the teams?
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000 He was already in the teams.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000 He was one of the instructors.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000 And he was the officer, officer of the day.
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000 And so he was on the base when I checked in.
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000 And he was cool.
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000 Really cool.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000 Just like, oh, you'll be fine.
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000 Yeah.
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000 And that's cool.
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000 Yeah, it was really cool.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.000 Yeah.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000 And, and I actually, I was going to do a little bit of a
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000 video.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000 And I, I actually, as I think back on who is around in those days.
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000 And I think most of the guys on the teams would would have been.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000 Yes.
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000 I wish I could say the same.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000 I was talking to my buddies that's a master chief now on the team.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000 He's still in.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000 But he said he was my roommate.
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000 But he said, we checked in.
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000 He walked in the room.
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000 I looked up at and said, looked at that.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000 I've been said, quit now and avoid the rush.
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000 I was like, oh, sorry.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000 I was such an asshole.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.68 That was as welcome aboard.
00:41:07.68 --> 00:41:09.84 We were laughing so hard that I said that through a
00:41:09.84 --> 00:41:11.68 freaking great guy.
00:41:11.68 --> 00:41:13.04 We had so many good times.
00:41:13.04 --> 00:41:15.04 That was how I introduced myself through.
00:41:15.04 --> 00:41:17.28 But you quit now and avoid the rush.
00:41:17.28 --> 00:41:19.20 That's really good.
00:41:19.20 --> 00:41:20.20 Good.
00:41:20.20 --> 00:41:24.24 How long did it take from when you checked into Buds to where you
00:41:24.24 --> 00:41:25.60 actually got into a class?
00:41:25.60 --> 00:41:28.56 That was about a month.
00:41:28.56 --> 00:41:31.68 We had some kind of course we took.
00:41:31.68 --> 00:41:35.68 There's just a killing time and building 401 across the
00:41:35.68 --> 00:41:38.40 street on the base.
00:41:38.40 --> 00:41:43.68 UDT was in building 208 on the base side of the
00:41:43.68 --> 00:41:45.68 amphib base.
00:41:45.68 --> 00:41:49.92 Then the teams were where the teams were.
00:41:49.92 --> 00:41:53.28 You have about a month and you're just kind of training and going
00:41:53.28 --> 00:41:57.04 to whatever kind of course they're putting to your work and out.
00:41:57.04 --> 00:42:00.40 You work out on your own.
00:42:00.40 --> 00:42:01.40 Which was fine.
00:42:01.40 --> 00:42:05.64 I just get up and run quite a bit.
00:42:05.64 --> 00:42:09.48 Swimming I didn't think was going to be a problem.
00:42:09.48 --> 00:42:15.48 The running, I want to make sure I could keep up on the run.
00:42:15.48 --> 00:42:17.72 You get this.
00:42:17.72 --> 00:42:20.28 This is still called UDTR.
00:42:20.28 --> 00:42:22.28 UDTR.
00:42:22.28 --> 00:42:24.28 UDTR.
00:42:24.28 --> 00:42:28.68 It's underwater demolition teams replacement.
00:42:28.68 --> 00:42:32.28 Underwater demolition team, training.
00:42:32.28 --> 00:42:33.28 Got it.
00:42:33.28 --> 00:42:36.72 UDTR.
00:42:36.72 --> 00:42:38.72 What class were you in?
00:42:38.72 --> 00:42:40.72 28.
00:42:40.72 --> 00:42:41.72 You're in class 28.
00:42:41.72 --> 00:42:43.08 Was that a big deal back then?
00:42:43.08 --> 00:42:45.36 Did you guys make a big deal that you were in class 28?
00:42:45.36 --> 00:42:46.80 You didn't even think about it yet.
00:42:46.80 --> 00:42:48.000 I wouldn't even think.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.24 I just wanted to get through the back.
00:42:52.24 --> 00:42:55.56 Did you guys wear helmet liners?
00:42:55.56 --> 00:42:56.56 I did.
00:42:56.56 --> 00:43:00.20 Did you put your number of class number on it?
00:43:00.20 --> 00:43:02.20 I don't think we did that.
00:43:02.20 --> 00:43:05.24 We, no, I'm sure we did.
00:43:05.24 --> 00:43:08.44 Class number wasn't a big thing yet.
00:43:08.44 --> 00:43:09.44 Not yet.
00:43:09.44 --> 00:43:12.000 Do you remember when you started?
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.72 Do you remember your first day of first phase?
00:43:13.72 --> 00:43:14.72 Oh, yeah.
00:43:14.72 --> 00:43:21.000 They heard there were 14 officers that were going to start class 28.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.72 How many people told them?
00:43:22.72 --> 00:43:28.000 Then there were about another 80 and listen guys, a total in the very beginning.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.56 But the first day of train, they do officers for two weeks.
00:43:32.56 --> 00:43:37.96 The officers had two weeks of training before the whole class comes together.
00:43:37.96 --> 00:43:43.20 The reason was that you had to get rid of the officers that are going to quit.
00:43:43.20 --> 00:43:46.84 We probably started with about 20 something.
00:43:46.84 --> 00:43:50.24 We did a number of officers right away.
00:43:50.24 --> 00:43:51.24 Not too many.
00:43:51.24 --> 00:43:58.68 I mean, certainly the majority of the officers remain in the class.
00:43:58.68 --> 00:44:05.12 A guy was telling me that like before a week, they'll have a class and they'll be whatever.
00:44:05.12 --> 00:44:07.32 Set officers, 10 officers.
00:44:07.32 --> 00:44:11.32 And then structural, who's number one in charge in the, you know, guy resistance?
00:44:11.32 --> 00:44:12.32 Yeah.
00:44:12.32 --> 00:44:15.16 This is before how like they say, who's next in charge and another guy who's next in
00:44:15.16 --> 00:44:17.80 charge and they'll go to like six deep.
00:44:17.80 --> 00:44:20.96 Because the sun today is man, you're going to go through all those officers.
00:44:20.96 --> 00:44:21.96 They're going to go on.
00:44:21.96 --> 00:44:22.96 Bye bye.
00:44:22.96 --> 00:44:24.96 They're getting good.
00:44:24.96 --> 00:44:25.96 Look at them now.
00:44:25.96 --> 00:44:27.96 They're going to be history.
00:44:27.96 --> 00:44:31.32 So the officers spent some time two weeks.
00:44:31.32 --> 00:44:33.88 They're weed now at some of those guys.
00:44:33.88 --> 00:44:37.28 And they weed it down to how many officers?
00:44:37.28 --> 00:44:39.88 I think they're about eight of us.
00:44:39.88 --> 00:44:40.88 Okay.
00:44:40.88 --> 00:44:44.88 So what were you guys doing when you were, when they did, when they treat you like
00:44:44.88 --> 00:44:51.88 bud students where they beat you guys and tearing you up during those two weeks before you joined the class,
00:44:51.88 --> 00:44:53.76 what they do to get rid of some of these guys?
00:44:53.76 --> 00:44:56.36 Well, the runs were longer.
00:44:56.36 --> 00:45:00.52 It was all the physical stuff and a lot of cold water.
00:45:00.52 --> 00:45:05.40 But it wasn't that hard to, it wasn't bad.
00:45:05.40 --> 00:45:08.20 The running was pretty, pretty hard.
00:45:08.20 --> 00:45:11.96 And I worked pretty hard to get ready for it.
00:45:11.96 --> 00:45:18.24 And I, as I recall, it, it, it wasn't a real problem for me.
00:45:18.24 --> 00:45:21.84 But by gum it was, it was hard.
00:45:21.84 --> 00:45:28.56 And I remember, I think I was in, in shape for it.
00:45:28.56 --> 00:45:31.28 But there's, I remember what this one run.
00:45:31.28 --> 00:45:32.28 We had this guy.
00:45:32.28 --> 00:45:34.44 In fact, he lives in Cornado today.
00:45:34.44 --> 00:45:36.48 He led the run.
00:45:36.48 --> 00:45:40.32 And she, you know, he just kept going and going.
00:45:40.32 --> 00:45:46.24 And I remember at the end of the run, I guess I experienced hypothermia, which I'd never
00:45:46.24 --> 00:45:48.60 known anything about.
00:45:48.60 --> 00:45:50.88 And I still didn't at that time.
00:45:50.88 --> 00:45:56.28 But I know that as soon as we got done with the run and I ran over to the, I guess,
00:45:56.28 --> 00:46:01.000 someplace where they sold baby Ruth candy bars, native about two of those puppies right
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.32 off the bat, before we went to the chow hall.
00:46:04.32 --> 00:46:09.88 And the, the, the, the instructors with these guys like Korean war vets and World War
00:46:09.88 --> 00:46:10.88 two vets.
00:46:10.88 --> 00:46:12.48 That's a good, good question.
00:46:12.48 --> 00:46:16.56 There was one guy that was a World War II guy.
00:46:16.56 --> 00:46:21.000 And I think, I think he was a Normandy.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:28.000 And then there was other guys that were Korean and, yeah, Korean war.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.48 I, oh, and Joe Barber.
00:46:29.48 --> 00:46:31.88 Yeah, he, he was a Second World War guy.
00:46:31.88 --> 00:46:33.44 But I don't know, he wasn't a frogman.
00:46:33.44 --> 00:46:36.12 I don't think, at that point.
00:46:36.12 --> 00:46:46.000 But, uh, and then the other guys were, were, yeah, the couple of the other instructors
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.68 were post, uh, Korea.
00:46:48.68 --> 00:46:50.40 And this is 1962.
00:46:50.40 --> 00:46:51.40 62.
00:46:51.40 --> 00:46:53.000 A lot of March of 62.
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.76 Oh, so this is like the seal teams that just performed.
00:46:56.76 --> 00:46:58.16 They had hit his head off that.
00:46:58.16 --> 00:46:59.16 Yeah.
00:46:59.16 --> 00:47:02.52 They were, and so we went on across it when we got done with training and went across
00:47:02.52 --> 00:47:08.84 straight there were 50 seals, uh, the seal team won had been formed and it consisted of
00:47:08.84 --> 00:47:11.04 50 guys.
00:47:11.04 --> 00:47:16.32 So first day of, you said you remembered your first day of actual training with the whole
00:47:16.32 --> 00:47:17.32 class.
00:47:17.32 --> 00:47:18.32 Mm-hmm.
00:47:18.32 --> 00:47:19.76 Did they stop you guys in the ground?
00:47:19.76 --> 00:47:21.56 Was it a more gentle entry?
00:47:21.56 --> 00:47:22.96 What they do to you?
00:47:22.96 --> 00:47:29.48 Well, we had a pretty serious conditioning hike.
00:47:29.48 --> 00:47:31.12 And so yeah.
00:47:31.12 --> 00:47:38.000 They were training, he's strung out from the hotel down the north.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.44 You know, just everywhere.
00:47:39.44 --> 00:47:42.24 But, uh, but yeah, we had a good run.
00:47:42.24 --> 00:47:45.72 And then everybody's pretty hot, so we's gotten a water.
00:47:45.72 --> 00:47:46.72 Good cool.
00:47:46.72 --> 00:47:47.72 Cool down.
00:47:47.72 --> 00:47:48.72 Yeah.
00:47:48.72 --> 00:47:49.72 Yeah.
00:47:49.72 --> 00:47:55.44 You train these, what, what a whole hot and you need to get cool off here.
00:47:55.44 --> 00:47:57.52 So were people quitting on the first day?
00:47:57.52 --> 00:47:58.52 Yeah.
00:47:58.52 --> 00:47:59.52 Yeah.
00:47:59.52 --> 00:48:00.84 We probably, I don't know how many.
00:48:00.84 --> 00:48:04.12 But yeah, we'd loot the first week there.
00:48:04.12 --> 00:48:09.48 We probably lost 20 guys and all together.
00:48:09.48 --> 00:48:10.48 And it's a guess.
00:48:10.48 --> 00:48:11.48 I don't know.
00:48:11.48 --> 00:48:15.24 Do you think they just didn't know what they were getting into?
00:48:15.24 --> 00:48:18.84 I'm sure that a couple of them just didn't know that all that.
00:48:18.84 --> 00:48:19.84 Yeah.
00:48:19.84 --> 00:48:25.48 Because I know that I know nowadays there's so much of a perspective of UDT guys.
00:48:25.48 --> 00:48:30.48 I think I'm going to, or seal team guys, they're going to know a lot about the team.
00:48:30.48 --> 00:48:40.44 And, but the Arga, you know, in those days, there was, yeah, they didn't have any idea.
00:48:40.44 --> 00:48:47.36 And probably, probably, there's one guy.
00:48:47.36 --> 00:48:49.28 He was from Holland.
00:48:49.28 --> 00:48:54.96 And he ended up graduating from high school in, up in the Northwest someplace.
00:48:54.96 --> 00:48:58.12 His name, he's a good friend of mine.
00:48:58.12 --> 00:49:00.28 Actually, lives in Coronado now.
00:49:00.28 --> 00:49:05.52 And his name is Dutch Swagamokkers.
00:49:05.52 --> 00:49:12.40 And he, when we first day in the pool, he could not swim.
00:49:12.40 --> 00:49:17.88 And you know that deal with a heavy, heavy, heavy, you have to keep your head above water,
00:49:17.88 --> 00:49:18.88 something like that.
00:49:18.88 --> 00:49:20.000 I don't know how long it was.
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.48 But you need to keep yourself afloat.
00:49:23.48 --> 00:49:26.04 This guy, he was a cyclist.
00:49:26.04 --> 00:49:28.52 So he had not one ounce of fat on it.
00:49:28.52 --> 00:49:32.36 So you put him on the pool, couldn't swim.
00:49:32.36 --> 00:49:34.08 And yeah, he's down in the bottom.
00:49:34.08 --> 00:49:36.08 He, he, he, he had his hands up there.
00:49:36.08 --> 00:49:38.36 And he's also, he wasn't real tall.
00:49:38.36 --> 00:49:41.28 He's about five, five, six, five, seven.
00:49:41.28 --> 00:49:42.64 And he had his hands up there.
00:49:42.64 --> 00:49:45.12 And he, you could tell he's a straighter.
00:49:45.12 --> 00:49:49.64 And then he'd sink, the fingers would go below the surface of the water.
00:49:49.64 --> 00:49:52.32 And then he would get himself back.
00:49:52.32 --> 00:49:54.32 But he made it through.
00:49:54.32 --> 00:50:02.08 And then when he, and then all those swimming pool thing, and then finally, thank God,
00:50:02.08 --> 00:50:04.000 he was issued a pair of fins.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.84 And then with his legs as a cyclist, he could out swim most people anyhow.
00:50:09.84 --> 00:50:13.24 And so, but he, I, I'll never forget that.
00:50:13.24 --> 00:50:15.40 I such a courageous guy.
00:50:15.40 --> 00:50:21.48 And how he, able, was able to do what he did with no swimming background tall.
00:50:21.48 --> 00:50:22.48 That's insane.
00:50:22.48 --> 00:50:23.48 Yeah, it really is.
00:50:23.48 --> 00:50:24.48 Yeah, that's crazy.
00:50:24.48 --> 00:50:25.48 Yeah.
00:50:25.48 --> 00:50:26.48 And he, but he did it.
00:50:26.48 --> 00:50:29.48 And he became, he was very successful.
00:50:29.48 --> 00:50:30.48 Frogman.
00:50:30.48 --> 00:50:35.48 And then he, he did some diving after the teams.
00:50:35.48 --> 00:50:36.48 Yeah.
00:50:36.48 --> 00:50:45.48 But he's a local guy in Coronado now and does, has a nice family and good wife and all that stuff.
00:50:45.48 --> 00:50:47.48 So you're rolling to Hellweek?
00:50:47.48 --> 00:50:49.48 What do you remember about Hellweek?
00:50:49.48 --> 00:50:51.48 I was, it was a bitch in Hell.
00:50:51.48 --> 00:50:59.68 I, we, was, what was the hype around going into it?
00:50:59.68 --> 00:51:01.36 Was people nervous?
00:51:01.36 --> 00:51:04.08 Were people excited about it?
00:51:04.08 --> 00:51:07.24 Were, like, were you scared?
00:51:07.24 --> 00:51:08.48 Was the hype going into it?
00:51:08.48 --> 00:51:15.000 I think nervous and scared probably was a, two, two, two biggest feelings about it.
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.80 Yeah, everybody was, and that's probably the same today.
00:51:18.80 --> 00:51:27.80 You know, it's just, yeah, it was, I, I know in my own head, you know, I thought about
00:51:27.80 --> 00:51:38.28 a lot, I, I swear there was, there was never a thought of not making it through Hellweek.
00:51:38.28 --> 00:51:42.52 I just wasn't sure, and I think that's how all of us felt.
00:51:42.52 --> 00:51:47.28 Yeah, we're all going to make it, but we don't know how.
00:51:47.28 --> 00:51:50.84 But we weren't asked to articulate that.
00:51:50.84 --> 00:51:53.60 We all, we had to do his hang in there.
00:51:53.60 --> 00:51:58.56 And, and so that was my mind, so, well, you know what that was?
00:51:58.56 --> 00:51:59.84 I'll just do it as long.
00:51:59.84 --> 00:52:01.28 I'll just hang in here.
00:52:01.28 --> 00:52:06.40 And if you have that mindset then I think it becomes manageable.
00:52:06.40 --> 00:52:10.04 And, and it was, it was hard.
00:52:10.04 --> 00:52:19.52 I mean, you got a damn cold and you didn't sleep, and, but you knew after Monday that
00:52:19.52 --> 00:52:21.68 there was Tuesday, you know what?
00:52:21.68 --> 00:52:24.52 Yeah, and we got done on Saturday morning.
00:52:24.52 --> 00:52:32.08 And, and you got through and, and it wasn't, you didn't have the feeling that, oh,
00:52:32.08 --> 00:52:33.68 kind of made it, I can't believe.
00:52:33.68 --> 00:52:34.68 I made it.
00:52:34.68 --> 00:52:35.68 No, you had the feeling.
00:52:35.68 --> 00:52:36.68 Well, who?
00:52:36.68 --> 00:52:38.84 I'm glad that's over with.
00:52:38.84 --> 00:52:45.16 But you, because I think your mindset was that you're, you're going to get through.
00:52:45.16 --> 00:52:51.88 It just, just how the hell you're going to do it, who knows, you know, so you just do it.
00:52:51.88 --> 00:52:53.56 How many people you think you lost?
00:52:53.56 --> 00:52:54.56 I don't know.
00:52:54.56 --> 00:52:57.40 Let's say we start with a grand total of 80.
00:52:57.40 --> 00:53:03.72 We probably lost at least half, you know, maybe maybe we're down to 30.
00:53:03.72 --> 00:53:08.88 I remember when we started with like six or seven boat crews and then at the end we had four.
00:53:08.88 --> 00:53:11.76 And so, you had six man and a boat.
00:53:11.76 --> 00:53:17.52 As I said before, I wasn't much of a student, but I could multiply six.
00:53:17.52 --> 00:53:19.52 Yeah, six out of three.
00:53:19.52 --> 00:53:22.08 Yeah, I carried the one.
00:53:22.08 --> 00:53:23.08 Yeah.
00:53:23.08 --> 00:53:29.48 I didn't, you get, so was, was your training broken up into phases the way it is now?
00:53:29.48 --> 00:53:33.92 So for me, I went through first phase, which was like the weeding out phase.
00:53:33.92 --> 00:53:35.08 It was nine weeks long.
00:53:35.08 --> 00:53:39.48 Then we went and dive phase where you learned how to scuba dive and drag her on all that.
00:53:39.48 --> 00:53:41.32 And then went into land warfare.
00:53:41.32 --> 00:53:44.84 I think dive phase was like seven weeks and then land warfare was another eight weeks or
00:53:44.84 --> 00:53:45.84 nine weeks.
00:53:45.84 --> 00:53:48.000 It was, it was somewhat like that.
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.20 Yeah, it was definitely that first phase right up to hell week, they just beat the crap
00:53:52.20 --> 00:53:55.60 out of you, you know, and getting shape.
00:53:55.60 --> 00:54:01.20 And then you had hell week and then I remember for a few days after hell week that next week
00:54:01.20 --> 00:54:05.72 we did some, we shot guns or something like that, where we, because everybody's pretty
00:54:05.72 --> 00:54:08.16 slow and so.
00:54:08.16 --> 00:54:11.20 And then the dive phase.
00:54:11.20 --> 00:54:15.32 And then, I guess.
00:54:15.32 --> 00:54:17.04 Was dive phase a challenge?
00:54:17.04 --> 00:54:18.04 No.
00:54:18.04 --> 00:54:20.16 For me, for you, not really.
00:54:20.16 --> 00:54:21.16 No.
00:54:21.16 --> 00:54:22.16 No, it was easy.
00:54:22.16 --> 00:54:23.88 Were you guys diving the old Emerson Rake?
00:54:23.88 --> 00:54:24.88 Were you guys diving?
00:54:24.88 --> 00:54:25.88 Yeah.
00:54:25.88 --> 00:54:26.88 Yeah, Emerson.
00:54:26.88 --> 00:54:27.88 So you started on open circuit.
00:54:27.88 --> 00:54:29.88 Did you guys do a pool competency?
00:54:29.88 --> 00:54:30.88 Yes.
00:54:30.88 --> 00:54:31.88 Oh, yeah.
00:54:31.88 --> 00:54:32.88 We were well prepared.
00:54:32.88 --> 00:54:35.44 I think, you know, everybody knew how to do it.
00:54:35.44 --> 00:54:39.88 And we were, we were a lot in the, we were in the pool a lot.
00:54:39.88 --> 00:54:43.60 And then we went off up at point low, my line.
00:54:43.60 --> 00:54:45.20 It was pool comp.
00:54:45.20 --> 00:54:51.06 Like when I went through pool comp was a big hurdle to get over where you had the 28
00:54:51.06 --> 00:54:52.06 is on.
00:54:52.06 --> 00:54:53.56 You had the devil hose regulate.
00:54:53.56 --> 00:54:54.56 Yeah.
00:54:54.56 --> 00:54:57.32 And down tie that thing and not rip your mask off.
00:54:57.32 --> 00:54:59.20 You up down there on the water.
00:54:59.20 --> 00:55:01.16 It was something that a lot of guys failed.
00:55:01.16 --> 00:55:04.96 Myself and could I failed at the first time I took it.
00:55:04.96 --> 00:55:07.28 But was that like a big hurdle for you guys?
00:55:07.28 --> 00:55:10.12 Or was it more like they were just instructing you?
00:55:10.12 --> 00:55:14.000 You know, I don't remember being that, that much harassment.
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.76 Maybe we got off easy on that because there was a little bit of that.
00:55:18.76 --> 00:55:23.24 But for the most part, it was instructive.
00:55:23.24 --> 00:55:28.04 And I never felt, you know, they made you take your regular, you know, do things
00:55:28.04 --> 00:55:30.04 men where you could hold your breath.
00:55:30.04 --> 00:55:31.04 Right.
00:55:31.04 --> 00:55:34.52 It was, I don't remember that being a problem or a challenge even.
00:55:34.52 --> 00:55:39.76 And then you did, you said you dove the Emerson rig for a close circuit.
00:55:39.76 --> 00:55:40.76 Do you remember?
00:55:40.76 --> 00:55:45.40 Oh, I remember we dove a closed circuit thing.
00:55:45.40 --> 00:55:48.28 But I don't, I think I can't remember the name of it.
00:55:48.28 --> 00:55:50.24 Might have been Emerson.
00:55:50.24 --> 00:55:52.000 But it was close circuit.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.68 And yeah, I remember some of the old guys told me they called it the green
00:55:55.68 --> 00:55:58.32 death because it was like a horrible rig to die for whatever reason.
00:55:58.32 --> 00:56:01.72 I don't know the reason why they just did like this Emerson rig.
00:56:01.72 --> 00:56:04.48 I think that was it.
00:56:04.48 --> 00:56:09.60 I remember there was a guy in my, this guy named Dowd who died in a training thing
00:56:09.60 --> 00:56:12.28 because of the, of the Emerson.
00:56:12.28 --> 00:56:15.36 I'm sure I think it was the Emerson.
00:56:15.36 --> 00:56:20.04 And I remember the poor guy who's in the decompression chamber there trying to bring
00:56:20.04 --> 00:56:25.40 him back and didn't do it.
00:56:25.40 --> 00:56:29.76 The diving you said you're diving off point Loma, you know, out doing basic dives in this
00:56:29.76 --> 00:56:30.76 thing.
00:56:30.76 --> 00:56:31.76 Right.
00:56:31.76 --> 00:56:35.000 And then what kind of land warfare training did you get?
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.20 Well, that's a good question.
00:56:37.20 --> 00:56:40.56 I don't remember getting much of it at home.
00:56:40.56 --> 00:56:42.56 Yeah, we didn't do it.
00:56:42.56 --> 00:56:47.08 We did a little bit of marches out of the O tie where I guess I, there are a bunch of houses
00:56:47.08 --> 00:56:48.08 out there now.
00:56:48.08 --> 00:56:55.52 You know, it was a lot of land hiking and going around.
00:56:55.52 --> 00:56:57.96 But there wasn't, there wasn't much of it.
00:56:57.96 --> 00:57:05.76 And it makes sense because seal team was really wasn't part of the mission anymore yet.
00:57:05.76 --> 00:57:08.16 So that land stuff, we were water guys.
00:57:08.16 --> 00:57:09.60 We were a frog man.
00:57:09.60 --> 00:57:14.04 So we didn't have to do a musco that stuff.
00:57:14.04 --> 00:57:18.92 So when you wrap up with training, did you go to airborne school?
00:57:18.92 --> 00:57:21.28 I went about a year after training.
00:57:21.28 --> 00:57:22.28 Okay.
00:57:22.28 --> 00:57:27.88 Some guys did, some guys didn't, and I don't know why my number was delayed, but then we
00:57:27.88 --> 00:57:30.20 did go to jump school at Benning.
00:57:30.20 --> 00:57:35.24 So when you graduated buds or you graduated UDT training and then you got stationed on
00:57:35.24 --> 00:57:37.44 a West Coast team, what team you go to?
00:57:37.44 --> 00:57:38.76 12.
00:57:38.76 --> 00:57:40.08 And what was it like showing up there?
00:57:40.08 --> 00:57:42.08 What was the deal?
00:57:42.08 --> 00:57:44.48 Well, it was great. I ran into Donald Loffland.
00:57:44.48 --> 00:57:46.20 Like I had met that very first day.
00:57:46.20 --> 00:57:55.52 I, there and I, I think first thing we did is, uh, this fellow officer of mine and I,
00:57:55.52 --> 00:58:01.20 he said, well, I guess kind of looked around and said, well, mys will go for run.
00:58:01.20 --> 00:58:08.48 So we just started working out and they wouldn't hold hell a lot going on.
00:58:08.48 --> 00:58:09.32 Yeah.
00:58:09.32 --> 00:58:11.92 Like what now it's not, is it 1963 yet?
00:58:11.92 --> 00:58:12.92 Yeah.
00:58:12.92 --> 00:58:13.92 Or still not.
00:58:13.92 --> 00:58:14.92 It's not late.
00:58:14.92 --> 00:58:16.52 62 August.
00:58:16.52 --> 00:58:17.60 We got done in August.
00:58:17.60 --> 00:58:19.68 Are you hearing rumbling as a male Vietnam?
00:58:19.68 --> 00:58:23.04 Is that like, not really.
00:58:23.04 --> 00:58:27.56 I don't, I don't know if anybody had been to Vietnam yet.
00:58:27.56 --> 00:58:28.56 Yeah.
00:58:28.56 --> 00:58:33.28 I mean, even talking, I've had guys on that word, you know, in the Navy in 1965.
00:58:33.28 --> 00:58:34.28 Yeah.
00:58:34.28 --> 00:58:35.28 He still weren't thinking about Vietnam.
00:58:35.28 --> 00:58:36.28 It was the right thing yet.
00:58:36.28 --> 00:58:39.64 And his late is 1965 then it's kind of kicked off everyone.
00:58:39.64 --> 00:58:41.12 That's just about exactly right.
00:58:41.12 --> 00:58:44.64 Because I got out in 65, figure was 65.
00:58:44.64 --> 00:58:54.32 And then, um, my brother, uh, actually, I was driving east to go work in some corporate
00:58:54.32 --> 00:58:56.32 job.
00:58:56.32 --> 00:58:59.04 And, uh, and then he was driving west.
00:58:59.04 --> 00:59:02.32 He just got done with OCS and he was heading to Coronado.
00:59:02.32 --> 00:59:04.24 So you know, guys, high five, that's you.
00:59:04.24 --> 00:59:05.24 Yeah.
00:59:05.24 --> 00:59:10.000 We met in Tucson, drink, we empty that town of Beirut.
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.28 And he went west and I went east.
00:59:12.28 --> 00:59:17.36 And, uh, my wife was pissed off because I drank too much the night before.
00:59:17.36 --> 00:59:20.96 But then we, we just, uh, carried on.
00:59:20.96 --> 00:59:24.04 And he had, he had followed in your footsteps, heard about what you were doing.
00:59:24.04 --> 00:59:25.04 Yeah.
00:59:25.04 --> 00:59:26.16 And thought that sounded like a good deal.
00:59:26.16 --> 00:59:27.16 Yeah.
00:59:27.16 --> 00:59:28.16 Yeah.
00:59:28.16 --> 00:59:32.34 What, what, what, how you tracking him as he's going through training, you're
00:59:32.34 --> 00:59:36.34 he was training pretty much, uh, he would say, I remember him.
00:59:36.34 --> 00:59:45.26 He got engaged and, uh, he got engaged while he was in training.
00:59:45.26 --> 00:59:49.62 And then got married after, after he was done with training.
00:59:49.62 --> 00:59:50.62 But, uh, yeah.
00:59:50.62 --> 00:59:54.10 And he would send pictures of, uh, engaged with party and stuff.
00:59:54.10 --> 00:59:57.66 And I mean, he had, uh, haircut like yours.
00:59:57.66 --> 01:00:02.04 And so there was, uh, in your, so, uh,
01:00:02.04 --> 01:00:07.84 they, um, but, you know, again, you know, we don't have the phone.
01:00:07.84 --> 01:00:08.84 Right.
01:00:08.84 --> 01:00:14.08 It's just interesting how, how, in frequently, we would communicate and yet not always
01:00:14.08 --> 01:00:15.08 felt up to date.
01:00:15.08 --> 01:00:16.08 Right.
01:00:16.08 --> 01:00:20.72 So, we, you got to just to rewind a little bit when you got to UDT.
01:00:20.72 --> 01:00:22.44 Do you say you, UDT 12?
01:00:22.44 --> 01:00:23.44 Yes.
01:00:23.44 --> 01:00:24.44 So, you get to UDT 12.
01:00:24.44 --> 01:00:25.84 Do you get assigned to a platoon?
01:00:25.84 --> 01:00:26.84 Do you go on deployment?
01:00:26.84 --> 01:00:27.84 What are you doing?
01:00:27.84 --> 01:00:28.84 Get there.
01:00:28.84 --> 01:00:31.16 I got assigned to a platoon with, uh, Clay Freeman.
01:00:31.16 --> 01:00:32.56 He was a platoon officer.
01:00:32.56 --> 01:00:36.40 And, uh, he was a great guy.
01:00:36.40 --> 01:00:37.20 Went to Dartmouth.
01:00:37.20 --> 01:00:40.88 He was a big time skier and, uh, good guy, but he out.
01:00:40.88 --> 01:00:47.000 So, we, and then, uh, we just hung out and I think we did some, we did a sub-op one time
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.84 off of, uh, San Cometi and, and then, uh, oh, and, and then what, what did happen is that
01:00:53.84 --> 01:00:57.40 we had the, the missile crisis with Castro.
01:00:57.40 --> 01:00:58.40 Okay.
01:00:58.40 --> 01:00:59.40 Deal.
01:00:59.40 --> 01:01:06.40 And, and that, and it up, not being anything really, but they, everybody loaded up on, uh,
01:01:06.40 --> 01:01:13.16 uh, APD, I think it's, uh, what we traveled in, and then, uh, they just did PT and they got
01:01:13.16 --> 01:01:18.44 down to the canal and then turned around and came back because the crisis was over.
01:01:18.44 --> 01:01:24.40 Also, like you loaded up on a ship to go over to Cuba for, to do whatever, to the right,
01:01:24.40 --> 01:01:25.40 right.
01:01:25.40 --> 01:01:26.40 Right.
01:01:26.40 --> 01:01:30.000 And, and not having it to do it, then came home.
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.40 Would you, would you guys go on deployments?
01:01:33.40 --> 01:01:35.84 You know, like when I got in the teams, you were going to get an up-toon, you're going
01:01:35.84 --> 01:01:38.68 to do a work-up, you were going to go on deployment, you're going to get done with that
01:01:38.68 --> 01:01:44.76 deployment, and the first couple to point, well, actually the first, uh, second, third,
01:01:44.76 --> 01:01:47.84 and fifth deployment, I think, it will all shit board for me.
01:01:47.84 --> 01:01:48.84 Okay.
01:01:48.84 --> 01:01:49.84 So I was on ships.
01:01:49.84 --> 01:01:50.84 Oh, is that right?
01:01:50.84 --> 01:01:56.36 Were you guys deploying like that or, we, when you got put in your platoon, did you say,
01:01:56.36 --> 01:02:00.92 okay, on this date, you're going to go on deployment, you're going to go to the South Pacific,
01:02:00.92 --> 01:02:03.80 or you're going to go to Southeast Asia on a ship or anything like that?
01:02:03.80 --> 01:02:11.60 Well, uh, uh, uh, not that organized, we would get assigned, and we knew that our platoon
01:02:11.60 --> 01:02:14.40 was going to go at such a such a time.
01:02:14.40 --> 01:02:21.84 You know, I think we were due to go out another six months after we got on, and, um, and
01:02:21.84 --> 01:02:28.72 we'd go, and I forgot how long the deployments were, but they were seem pretty long.
01:02:28.72 --> 01:02:30.72 So did you do one of those deployments?
01:02:30.72 --> 01:02:36.72 Well, keep talking about God intervening here.
01:02:36.72 --> 01:02:50.80 What happened to me is, um, uh, uh, we got a new CO, took, took, Mac, the pipes position.
01:02:50.80 --> 01:02:58.96 But this new CO was a guy who was a naval academy grad, and, uh, he was coming to the
01:02:58.96 --> 01:03:05.96 teams, you know, and he said, kind of, a naval academy guy going to run Macails Navy,
01:03:05.96 --> 01:03:07.84 are you kidding me?
01:03:07.84 --> 01:03:17.56 And so Bill Robinson shows up, and, uh, he took one look at me for some reason, and, uh,
01:03:17.56 --> 01:03:22.80 he said, I don't know how, I don't know if you're going to do very well in the teams.
01:03:22.80 --> 01:03:29.08 And I say, okay, he says, yeah, first thing, you need a haircut, you know, because I was
01:03:29.08 --> 01:03:36.12 really taking this role that they described in this thing seriously, but being a naval
01:03:36.12 --> 01:03:42.60 academy grad, he couldn't exactly embrace the same thing that I was embracing.
01:03:42.60 --> 01:03:47.52 And so he says, I'll tell you what, I'm good friends with Jack Sutter and Jack, so
01:03:47.52 --> 01:03:49.52 this was the head of the training department.
01:03:49.52 --> 01:03:52.04 He just, I'm going to see if I can get you a job over there.
01:03:52.04 --> 01:03:53.76 I said, who?
01:03:53.76 --> 01:03:55.16 Talk about the briar patch.
01:03:55.16 --> 01:03:56.16 Yeah.
01:03:56.16 --> 01:03:57.16 I mean, that's a hell of a deal.
01:03:57.16 --> 01:03:59.56 Yeah, you get me into the training department.
01:03:59.56 --> 01:04:00.56 Um, fine.
01:04:00.56 --> 01:04:02.40 The training department at UDT?
01:04:02.40 --> 01:04:03.40 Yeah.
01:04:03.40 --> 01:04:04.40 Okay.
01:04:04.40 --> 01:04:05.64 It building to avoid.
01:04:05.64 --> 01:04:10.72 And so, it just wasn't the distance in the training department that ran, uh, basic
01:04:10.72 --> 01:04:11.72 training.
01:04:11.72 --> 01:04:12.72 Yes.
01:04:12.72 --> 01:04:13.72 It's like, oh, it is.
01:04:13.72 --> 01:04:14.72 Yeah.
01:04:14.72 --> 01:04:17.40 So you're going to be like a UDT instructor, UDT instructor.
01:04:17.40 --> 01:04:19.32 And how long you've been into team for?
01:04:19.32 --> 01:04:20.80 Well, that was in December.
01:04:20.80 --> 01:04:22.04 I got in an August.
01:04:22.04 --> 01:04:26.16 So what September October, no one was in three months.
01:04:26.16 --> 01:04:28.92 And this guy looks at you and says you probably can be better off than the instructor.
01:04:28.92 --> 01:04:29.92 Yeah.
01:04:29.92 --> 01:04:30.92 How was that?
01:04:30.92 --> 01:04:33.24 And I was all for it.
01:04:33.24 --> 01:04:37.56 And so I went over in the training, training in it.
01:04:37.56 --> 01:04:40.36 And, um, and I just loved it.
01:04:40.36 --> 01:04:41.36 It was all for God.
01:04:41.36 --> 01:04:42.36 I mean, who?
01:04:42.36 --> 01:04:45.36 The being an instructor is a great deal.
01:04:45.36 --> 01:04:47.24 And, uh, you know, I was qualified.
01:04:47.24 --> 01:04:52.40 I mean, I could run and I could do all that stuff, you know, and I knew everything about
01:04:52.40 --> 01:04:55.16 what what trainees go through.
01:04:55.16 --> 01:04:58.04 But I had no, I did not deploy.
01:04:58.04 --> 01:05:01.12 I didn't, you know, I did, we did a couple practice runs.
01:05:01.12 --> 01:05:06.68 But I, but Bill felt that it was better for the overall organization if I was there
01:05:06.68 --> 01:05:09.52 or not with him.
01:05:09.52 --> 01:05:15.72 And, uh, so I, I was there.
01:05:15.72 --> 01:05:17.000 So I finished out my, my Navel's career there.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.44 And then, uh, how many years were you in instructor four?
01:05:20.44 --> 01:05:21.76 Two and a half years.
01:05:21.76 --> 01:05:24.12 And you put through how many classes I can.
01:05:24.12 --> 01:05:36.56 Well, there was a 30, 31, 32, 32, well, 30, class 30, 31, 32, 33 and start of 34.
01:05:36.56 --> 01:05:40.24 And my brother was in class 35.
01:05:40.24 --> 01:05:44.48 And then, um, we, uh, yeah.
01:05:44.48 --> 01:05:49.48 And he, you know, I was out by the time Danny started my brother.
01:05:49.48 --> 01:05:57.84 What, uh, what you learn about humans and their ability to push through when you were an instructor
01:05:57.84 --> 01:06:00.28 as compared to when you were going through it yourself?
01:06:00.28 --> 01:06:02.48 I never was an instructor.
01:06:02.48 --> 01:06:05.36 And so I never got to see kind of the other side of it.
01:06:05.36 --> 01:06:07.84 But I, you know, obviously got a bunch of friends at one instructor.
01:06:07.84 --> 01:06:08.84 And he was interesting.
01:06:08.84 --> 01:06:13.16 Some of the takeaways that they'd have from watching people go through these extremely
01:06:13.16 --> 01:06:14.76 stressful scenarios.
01:06:14.76 --> 01:06:18.56 You know, that's a good, that's a good point.
01:06:18.56 --> 01:06:21.04 And, uh, and a good question.
01:06:21.04 --> 01:06:24.60 And there's probably a lot about that.
01:06:24.60 --> 01:06:27.68 That's, that's profound and, and would be instructive.
01:06:27.68 --> 01:06:35.32 And I, I think I just, uh, the way I operated it was probably just, uh,
01:06:35.32 --> 01:06:42.32 on my gut, you know, and I'd see guys come into training and, and you could tell,
01:06:42.32 --> 01:06:46.36 uh, is this, this guy's going to make it or not.
01:06:46.36 --> 01:06:49.04 And it was, it was great watching them.
01:06:49.04 --> 01:06:54.92 The ones that are determined and that are really, it's like probably like being a coach,
01:06:54.92 --> 01:06:58.56 you know, it's like, I, I know my son played a water poll.
01:06:58.56 --> 01:07:05.000 And, you know, and the coaches, a good coach is, assesses his, his players.
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.12 You know, really well and thoughtfully.
01:07:07.12 --> 01:07:16.44 And, uh, I think I, you could, I probably would, I remember thinking that about, I can't
01:07:16.44 --> 01:07:24.32 think of any specific case, but I would remember kind of making a judgment based on what
01:07:24.32 --> 01:07:29.40 I saw, uh, of their performance, you know, in the training.
01:07:29.40 --> 01:07:37.28 So I, I, that's about, and I couldn't, I don't guess I had, I could differentiate the
01:07:37.28 --> 01:07:42.04 ones that could make it and not, I mean, between the ones that could make it not, I could
01:07:42.04 --> 01:07:43.28 differentiate between them.
01:07:43.28 --> 01:07:49.64 But then you have a group of, of trainees that got through and, you know, other than the
01:07:49.64 --> 01:07:56.08 common deal that they were determined and focused and worked hard and committed.
01:07:56.08 --> 01:08:02.44 It seems strange, uh, that they're really, overall these years, they've never been able
01:08:02.44 --> 01:08:06.04 to figure out who's going to make it and who's not going to make it and it doesn't matter
01:08:06.04 --> 01:08:11.92 if you were, of division one wrestler or division one water polar player, you might
01:08:11.92 --> 01:08:16.96 quit and you, and you might make it, you could be a, you know, person that, like, doesn't
01:08:16.96 --> 01:08:18.64 know how to swim like you're by there.
01:08:18.64 --> 01:08:19.64 Like, you're good.
01:08:19.64 --> 01:08:22.84 You'd think never to million to the years, this person can, and they can make it.
01:08:22.84 --> 01:08:26.36 Yep, they've just not really figured it out, right?
01:08:26.36 --> 01:08:28.44 Really figured out who's going to make it and who's not going to make it.
01:08:28.44 --> 01:08:29.44 Right.
01:08:29.44 --> 01:08:36.72 Well, you know, it just reminds me there was a guy, an officer in my class, um, when we were
01:08:36.72 --> 01:08:43.000 doing the, uh, the two week pre-off sort of deal, and he was an Olympic swimmer.
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:50.04 He was a backstrokeer and he went to Yale, um, kind of, I haven't thought about him until
01:08:50.04 --> 01:08:51.04 this moment.
01:08:51.04 --> 01:08:56.44 Uh, he, he was in my class, and I remember this other guy in my class who was a swimmer
01:08:56.44 --> 01:09:01.12 Dartmouth, and he was, you know, he knew all about good swimmers and he swam against this
01:09:01.12 --> 01:09:04.84 guy and he says, yeah, he's, he was in the Olympics.
01:09:04.84 --> 01:09:06.12 He said, oh my God.
01:09:06.12 --> 01:09:09.28 Yeah, and I remember him, and he quit after two days.
01:09:09.28 --> 01:09:11.96 You know, he couldn't run.
01:09:11.96 --> 01:09:13.80 Uh, he could swim.
01:09:13.80 --> 01:09:17.28 They're going to figure out what your weekend aren't they?
01:09:17.28 --> 01:09:18.28 Yeah.
01:09:18.28 --> 01:09:19.28 I think they're going to, yeah.
01:09:19.28 --> 01:09:25.000 It's going to, you have to be, you have to be, I was kind of lucky that I was, I was
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.80 okay at kind of everything.
01:09:27.80 --> 01:09:29.16 I wasn't going to win anything.
01:09:29.16 --> 01:09:32.84 I never, I never want to rent, I don't think I ever want to run my entire time in the
01:09:32.84 --> 01:09:33.84 sealed teams.
01:09:33.84 --> 01:09:34.68 I don't think I ever want to swim back.
01:09:34.68 --> 01:09:36.16 I can know I never want to swim.
01:09:36.16 --> 01:09:41.16 But I was kind of like okay at pretty much everything.
01:09:41.16 --> 01:09:44.84 And that is a better way to be than to be an Olympic swimmer.
01:09:44.84 --> 01:09:45.84 Oh, yeah.
01:09:45.84 --> 01:09:50.08 You're going to be able to run.
01:09:50.08 --> 01:09:51.08 Yeah, you actually, that doesn't work.
01:09:51.08 --> 01:09:52.08 I think this guy's name was Dolby.
01:09:52.08 --> 01:09:53.08 I have to look him up.
01:09:53.08 --> 01:09:57.96 But, uh, yeah, I remember gosh, he was poor guy.
01:09:57.96 --> 01:10:02.16 He just wasn't built for running and all the land stuff.
01:10:02.16 --> 01:10:06.52 And if it's a good thing he never had got to the obstacle course because he probably
01:10:06.52 --> 01:10:07.52 would have died.
01:10:07.52 --> 01:10:12.08 But, well, he was creating a water though.
01:10:12.08 --> 01:10:18.44 So you spend these two and a half years putting students through seeing that side of things.
01:10:18.44 --> 01:10:20.36 And then it's just your time is up in the Navy.
01:10:20.36 --> 01:10:21.36 Yep.
01:10:21.36 --> 01:10:23.60 And you decide you're going to, you decide you're going to move on.
01:10:23.60 --> 01:10:25.88 I had to go get a job.
01:10:25.88 --> 01:10:34.88 And she, my heritage, a lot of the way I was form growing up was the whole boarding school,
01:10:34.88 --> 01:10:35.88 the corporate deal.
01:10:35.88 --> 01:10:37.60 My dad was a corporate guy.
01:10:37.60 --> 01:10:40.40 And that's actually what I'm going to be doing.
01:10:40.40 --> 01:10:47.32 And then when I got in UDT, I realized that's not how I have to live my life.
01:10:47.32 --> 01:10:49.80 But I signed up for a corporate job anyway.
01:10:49.80 --> 01:10:54.64 And I was in this management training program back in Baltimore, Maryland.
01:10:54.64 --> 01:10:56.68 And I love that the company's wonderful.
01:10:56.68 --> 01:10:58.52 It's a small, a comical company.
01:10:58.52 --> 01:11:00.92 They sell spices and the people.
01:11:00.92 --> 01:11:03.92 The nicest ones that people have met in any group.
01:11:03.92 --> 01:11:09.48 And, uh, and they were, God, they were so great to me and everything getting started.
01:11:09.48 --> 01:11:14.12 But I realized, uh, I remember my first day of work.
01:11:14.12 --> 01:11:17.16 I was up in the sixth floor of this building.
01:11:17.16 --> 01:11:18.64 And I spent the whole day in there.
01:11:18.64 --> 01:11:23.44 And as I, as it was, as it was sunny and bright when my wife taught me off of work.
01:11:23.44 --> 01:11:27.96 And then at night when I come down to about six and it was still, it was summertime.
01:11:27.96 --> 01:11:30.52 So it was still light.
01:11:30.52 --> 01:11:32.60 And I could tell it had rained during the day.
01:11:32.60 --> 01:11:35.24 And I said, what's this all about?
01:11:35.24 --> 01:11:36.96 It rained.
01:11:36.96 --> 01:11:39.84 I was in this building and I wasn't even aware of it.
01:11:39.84 --> 01:11:42.52 And I said, this is, this is not how I want to live.
01:11:42.52 --> 01:11:45.36 I don't want to live in an office.
01:11:45.36 --> 01:11:49.16 So then I stuck with a training program for a couple of years.
01:11:49.16 --> 01:11:52.44 And then I, I had to make a move.
01:11:52.44 --> 01:11:53.88 So I did.
01:11:53.88 --> 01:12:02.16 But I, and I ended up, um, a friend of mine was teaching school at Ponaill School in Hawaii.
01:12:02.16 --> 01:12:06.04 So I, uh, I said, so I rode him.
01:12:06.04 --> 01:12:08.20 I said, you got to, he got any openings out there.
01:12:08.20 --> 01:12:11.12 So he got me a job as a teacher at Ponaill.
01:12:11.12 --> 01:12:17.92 And I said, boy, from Baltimore to Hornlittle, that's not a bad switch.
01:12:17.92 --> 01:12:23.16 Uh, you're tracking your brother as he goes through training.
01:12:23.16 --> 01:12:26.76 And, you know, he's, he's doing good.
01:12:26.76 --> 01:12:27.96 Makes it through training.
01:12:27.96 --> 01:12:28.96 Yep.
01:12:28.96 --> 01:12:30.84 Um, what is he, he's writing you letters?
01:12:30.84 --> 01:12:32.80 How are you, is he calling you on the phone?
01:12:32.80 --> 01:12:34.48 How are you, how are you tracking?
01:12:34.48 --> 01:12:37.72 Like, like you said, we don't have, uh, cell phones in our pocket.
01:12:37.72 --> 01:12:39.72 I think I think you're right, right?
01:12:39.72 --> 01:12:41.60 No, it's much different, of course.
01:12:41.60 --> 01:12:45.04 But I think phone calls, uh, we would call long distance.
01:12:45.04 --> 01:12:49.60 And always cause the whole bunch of money to, to call long distance.
01:12:49.60 --> 01:12:52.16 And those days, but it wasn't that onerous.
01:12:52.16 --> 01:12:56.56 And we could, we could, we could, we knew what was going on.
01:12:56.56 --> 01:13:00.12 And, and as that's happening, and now he's in the teams.
01:13:00.12 --> 01:13:05.12 And now Vietnam is sort of in, you know, escalating very rapidly.
01:13:05.12 --> 01:13:06.12 Yeah.
01:13:06.12 --> 01:13:08.88 And is he talking to you about the fact that he's probably going to end up
01:13:08.88 --> 01:13:09.88 deploying to Vietnam?
01:13:09.88 --> 01:13:14.80 No, he was playing on going into the training unit just like I did.
01:13:14.80 --> 01:13:17.96 And I thought for sure that that would happen.
01:13:17.96 --> 01:13:22.44 But then, and he did, did one deployment in Vietnam.
01:13:22.44 --> 01:13:24.24 And then came back.
01:13:24.24 --> 01:13:26.20 And that was out of UDT deployment.
01:13:26.20 --> 01:13:27.20 Yes.
01:13:27.20 --> 01:13:28.20 He was good.
01:13:28.20 --> 01:13:29.20 12.
01:13:29.20 --> 01:13:32.56 So he does a UDT deployment to Vietnam.
01:13:32.56 --> 01:13:35.56 And they're doing the kind of UDT stuff.
01:13:35.56 --> 01:13:36.56 Yeah.
01:13:36.56 --> 01:13:37.56 Worked a little bit.
01:13:37.56 --> 01:13:40.92 But it wasn't really, I shouldn't say that, because I've talked to a bunch of UD
01:13:40.92 --> 01:13:41.92 cut.
01:13:41.92 --> 01:13:43.28 T guys that did some really dangerous stuff.
01:13:43.28 --> 01:13:44.28 And yeah.
01:13:44.28 --> 01:13:47.08 Oh, there was, there were doing ambushes and stuff.
01:13:47.08 --> 01:13:48.92 Okay, there playing with guns.
01:13:48.92 --> 01:13:49.92 Yeah.
01:13:49.92 --> 01:13:53.28 It was, it was different.
01:13:53.28 --> 01:13:55.56 And he, and he came home, and what was his, what was it?
01:13:55.56 --> 01:13:56.56 What was it about that deployment?
01:13:56.56 --> 01:13:58.16 What do you tell you about that?
01:13:58.16 --> 01:14:10.60 Well, he, he just thought that he wasn't sure how much he and how purposeful it seemed
01:14:10.60 --> 01:14:11.60 to him.
01:14:11.60 --> 01:14:12.60 I mean, he wasn't rebellious.
01:14:12.60 --> 01:14:16.04 He was going along with the program and happy to be part of the team.
01:14:16.04 --> 01:14:17.20 And all of that.
01:14:17.20 --> 01:14:21.60 But it wasn't, he was just something he had to do.
01:14:21.60 --> 01:14:23.92 He gladiated it and got it done.
01:14:23.92 --> 01:14:31.60 But then the whole Vietnam spirit is pretty, pretty grown.
01:14:31.60 --> 01:14:34.72 Even with the teams, even with great people like UDT guys.
01:14:34.72 --> 01:14:39.96 And it's just, no one really knew what they were doing.
01:14:39.96 --> 01:14:42.76 And they'll tell you, gosh, we were over there.
01:14:42.76 --> 01:14:46.88 And we didn't, we weren't really sure what was going on.
01:14:46.88 --> 01:14:51.48 And then he did tell me like this one instance.
01:14:51.48 --> 01:14:59.56 They were setting up, they had an ambush all set up and then some VC come down in the river.
01:14:59.56 --> 01:15:07.56 And the, and Danny, Danny said that he had his gun up, and he was ready to let a rip.
01:15:07.56 --> 01:15:09.40 And then he felt this tap on it shoulder.
01:15:09.40 --> 01:15:13.56 And there was this, and let's, uh, Doc forgot his last name.
01:15:13.56 --> 01:15:14.80 But he was a medic guy.
01:15:14.80 --> 01:15:18.88 And, uh, and he said, he shook him off.
01:15:18.88 --> 01:15:22.36 And so Danny kind of lowered his weapon.
01:15:22.36 --> 01:15:27.04 And then next thing you know, there's a whole boatload of him coming down.
01:15:27.04 --> 01:15:30.76 And you know, somehow the doc was aware, Danny wasn't.
01:15:30.76 --> 01:15:35.80 But the doc said, hey, we don't, we don't want to play guns here.
01:15:35.80 --> 01:15:40.24 Just now we're outnumbered and sure enough.
01:15:40.24 --> 01:15:41.12 They got through it.
01:15:41.12 --> 01:15:44.92 But there was a, it was that kind of thing that was going on.
01:15:44.92 --> 01:15:48.84 And if you have no, no one never really knew what.
01:15:48.84 --> 01:15:50.92 It was, what was happening.
01:15:50.92 --> 01:15:56.96 And he, um, so he gets back.
01:15:56.96 --> 01:16:05.16 And then he was hoping that his next deal would be to get, get a sign to the training.
01:16:05.16 --> 01:16:11.16 And, um, but instead he got, he got a sign to seal team one.
01:16:11.16 --> 01:16:16.80 And, uh, they were heading out, they were going to deploy to Vietnam, you know, shortly.
01:16:16.80 --> 01:16:21.24 And I remember his friend of ours, Lou, he was an officer in the team.
01:16:21.24 --> 01:16:28.68 And because Danny was married and Lou said, hey, uh, and Danny was passed because he
01:16:28.68 --> 01:16:29.68 wanted to go the training.
01:16:29.68 --> 01:16:34.84 You know, and so, um, but he, he's fine with it.
01:16:34.84 --> 01:16:36.12 That's what I'm going to do.
01:16:36.12 --> 01:16:40.64 And so, Lou said, hey, you know, a single guy and he said, you know, let me take it
01:16:40.64 --> 01:16:41.64 place.
01:16:41.64 --> 01:16:45.16 I'll take it place and I'll go in the teams and you can go the training.
01:16:45.16 --> 01:16:47.16 And then, uh, he was Lou was in the training.
01:16:47.16 --> 01:16:48.48 He got it already.
01:16:48.48 --> 01:16:56.68 And, uh, Danny said, no, it's, uh, I'm going to see this through, you know, so he did.
01:16:56.68 --> 01:17:03.04 And, um, and so, just kind of the thing it works out.
01:17:03.04 --> 01:17:10.08 But, um, and then so, so he goes on to deployment of Vietnam and did you hear from him
01:17:10.08 --> 01:17:13.44 while he was over there?
01:17:13.44 --> 01:17:26.12 He's over there for about a week and I got a phone call from him.
01:17:26.12 --> 01:17:36.20 Uh, yes, uh, from the COO, COT, one of his Frank Anderson.
01:17:36.20 --> 01:17:43.20 He said that.
01:17:43.20 --> 01:17:59.80 He said that, uh, he said that, uh, Danny was killed.
01:17:59.80 --> 01:18:10.32 And I, uh, so that's the last, I heard.
01:18:10.32 --> 01:18:14.36 The first and the last I heard of that deployment.
01:18:14.36 --> 01:18:21.84 And now I was in Baltimore at the time.
01:18:21.84 --> 01:18:30.16 Did that, uh, make the COO you were sitting in all day seem even smaller?
01:18:30.16 --> 01:18:39.84 Well, I had pretty much committed to moving out of the COO of COO anyhow.
01:18:39.84 --> 01:18:48.20 So that, in, in and out of itself wasn't, wasn't a problem.
01:18:48.20 --> 01:18:56.12 But it did, it did raise, uh, you know, and then, of course, my parents were devastated
01:18:56.12 --> 01:19:01.64 and stuff as, as were the parents of 50,000 other people.
01:19:01.64 --> 01:19:10.000 And, uh, but it did, and then, uh, that was an April.
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.84 And so, an August, I would, I would be coming back out for the, uh, we all, you had to
01:19:16.84 --> 01:19:20.96 go two weeks of, uh, training, um, because of the reserve.
01:19:20.96 --> 01:19:22.36 So they were still in the reserve.
01:19:22.36 --> 01:19:23.68 So I still, the reserve.
01:19:23.68 --> 01:19:29.96 So I, I was just in the, come back to Coronado and do that in August.
01:19:29.96 --> 01:19:40.88 And, uh, so, um, but I knew, I knew then I'd probably would figure out what to do something
01:19:40.88 --> 01:19:41.88 else.
01:19:41.88 --> 01:19:46.60 I actually, during that two week deal, I'd found out about Ponoho and, uh, already made
01:19:46.60 --> 01:19:48.36 a plan to get out of the cubicle.
01:19:48.36 --> 01:20:00.64 But, um, but going to, uh, but it did raise a question of, uh, you should, I go back
01:20:00.64 --> 01:20:06.40 in and because Frank asks, he says, he didn't ask me to come back in.
01:20:06.40 --> 01:20:11.64 But he said that, uh, I, I brought a, I kind of mentioned it to him.
01:20:11.64 --> 01:20:15.16 He says, boy, if you want to come back, I'd love to have you, you know, because we got
01:20:15.16 --> 01:20:20.48 it along well and actually, build Robinson, the guy that sent me to the training and we
01:20:20.48 --> 01:20:22.20 ended up becoming real close friends.
01:20:22.20 --> 01:20:29.52 But, um, but, uh, but Frank says, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you, we could use, we need,
01:20:29.52 --> 01:20:31.72 we need people and we'd love to have you back.
01:20:32.72 --> 01:20:34.52 I said, well, I'll think about it.
01:20:34.52 --> 01:20:41.72 And, um, it was, uh, I was wrestling with that for a few months.
01:20:41.72 --> 01:20:48.44 And then, um, we got done with one of those, uh, during those two weeks, we got a lot
01:20:48.44 --> 01:20:54.28 of briefing from guys that were in Vietnam and they would, uh, tell us what was going on.
01:20:55.28 --> 01:21:00.40 And, uh, usually we were, and so we'd get, we'd listen to those.
01:21:01.48 --> 01:21:08.000 And I remember, we were out, uh, in, in a, in a break during those briefings, I know,
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.40 was, we were out, kind of, smoke a cigarette and just kind of hanging out and taking a break
01:21:13.40 --> 01:21:17.44 and, and Tom Dorisi, who had just got back from Vietnam.
01:21:17.44 --> 01:21:25.76 Uh, and I were talking here, he, he, I put him through training and we were good friends.
01:21:25.76 --> 01:21:33.96 And so I, I mentioned during the deal that, uh, we still got to go in back in.
01:21:33.96 --> 01:21:41.08 And, uh, and he looked at me and he says, shook his head.
01:21:41.08 --> 01:21:43.92 He says, it's all bullshit.
01:21:43.92 --> 01:21:46.08 The Vietnam's all bullshit.
01:21:46.08 --> 01:21:50.36 He says, you, you don't want to go back in.
01:21:50.36 --> 01:21:59.52 And, uh, and for some reason, uh, I think, I think he was right about, you know, I mean,
01:21:59.52 --> 01:22:04.64 I didn't give everybody real-enless that that was, that was a mistake, it was horrible mistake.
01:22:04.64 --> 01:22:13.72 And a lot of, a lot of people, it, it cost the country a lot and, um, and it cost a lot
01:22:13.72 --> 01:22:16.56 of families a lot.
01:22:16.56 --> 01:22:24.84 So I, I, my personal decision was, you know, I put another month, I decided that no,
01:22:24.84 --> 01:22:30.72 it's, it's not the right thing to do.
01:22:30.72 --> 01:22:37.52 I, I, I, I, I guess I thought of my parents, I thought it, I, I just, I just thought about
01:22:37.52 --> 01:22:39.52 the whole Vietnam thing, I guess.
01:22:39.52 --> 01:22:48.28 And, uh, and I'm not sure exactly what caused me to come to that, come to that decision.
01:22:48.28 --> 01:22:57.04 But, um, it, it, it just, uh, just it seemed to be the right thing to do.
01:22:57.04 --> 01:23:00.64 Yeah, I can't even imagine trying, you know, you trying to tell your parents that you're
01:23:00.64 --> 01:23:01.92 going to make that decision.
01:23:01.92 --> 01:23:07.04 That doesn't seem like that would have been, been, been the right thing to do in that
01:23:07.04 --> 01:23:08.04 scenario.
01:23:08.04 --> 01:23:15.32 A, who knows, you know, I, uh, I didn't, I never really got that far, so I didn't have
01:23:15.32 --> 01:23:22.32 to really hurt my head over, uh, but I, it's a decision I made.
01:23:22.32 --> 01:23:23.32 Mm-hmm.
01:23:23.32 --> 01:23:25.12 So you stay in the reserves, though?
01:23:25.12 --> 01:23:28.20 Yes, well, you, you were obligated to.
01:23:28.20 --> 01:23:36.32 Um, so I stayed in for about seven more years and then, then got out, but it was, I was
01:23:36.32 --> 01:23:43.84 more into living in Hawaii and teaching school and, and getting, getting, getting, Ellen,
01:23:43.84 --> 01:23:45.84 kids were showing up.
01:23:45.84 --> 01:23:50.52 So, yeah, when did you start surfing?
01:23:50.52 --> 01:23:55.60 I was a right pole age of 22 and Cornell, when I first got to Cornell.
01:23:55.60 --> 01:24:02.72 And, uh, they, uh, you know, like I said, when I first pulled in there and those cars with
01:24:02.72 --> 01:24:07.24 the boards hanging out and everything were kind of just such a, so compelling.
01:24:07.24 --> 01:24:15.08 So I signed up and, uh, a butterboard, butterhobey, uh, Phil Edwards bottle and, uh, Dana
01:24:15.08 --> 01:24:18.04 Point and drove up there and got it and started surfing.
01:24:18.04 --> 01:24:21.80 Was that before Dana Point was they put all the, yeah, oh man.
01:24:21.80 --> 01:24:22.80 Yeah.
01:24:22.80 --> 01:24:24.24 Was it as good as like Malibu?
01:24:24.24 --> 01:24:25.80 How good was it?
01:24:25.80 --> 01:24:27.80 It, it usually was bigger.
01:24:27.80 --> 01:24:30.36 Yeah, it was as good as Malibu.
01:24:30.36 --> 01:24:36.72 And it was as huge and it, it's usually a, a big swell, uh, north swell.
01:24:36.72 --> 01:24:40.80 And then it was, yeah, it was, it was killer Dana.
01:24:40.80 --> 01:24:43.72 So that must have hurt, uh, being in Baltimore as well.
01:24:43.72 --> 01:24:44.72 Now you can't surf.
01:24:44.72 --> 01:24:47.92 Yeah, although I didn't go to Rojo with Beachwood.
01:24:47.92 --> 01:24:48.92 Okay.
01:24:48.92 --> 01:24:49.92 Yeah.
01:24:49.92 --> 01:24:51.40 We didn't want there a couple of times.
01:24:51.40 --> 01:24:55.64 And, uh, yeah, but it really had to get back to California.
01:24:55.64 --> 01:24:57.80 It really important.
01:24:57.80 --> 01:25:03.000 And then you end up in Hawaii, you're teaching school and art and, and you're just getting
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.52 more and more, or I should say, I guess continuing to find other ways to be involved in
01:25:06.52 --> 01:25:07.52 the water at this time.
01:25:07.52 --> 01:25:08.52 Yes.
01:25:08.52 --> 01:25:14.44 And then, uh, it was, I got really interested in outwardly our canoe racing.
01:25:14.44 --> 01:25:19.88 And, um, and so I joined this canoe club and there was one other guy there that was a
01:25:19.88 --> 01:25:23.76 holy guy in the restaurant, uh, a low coin.
01:25:23.76 --> 01:25:27.88 And, uh, we got on a crew and, uh, I loved it.
01:25:27.88 --> 01:25:31.52 And became real good friends for the coaches, uh, baby bell.
01:25:31.52 --> 01:25:34.84 And he, uh, he, he was great.
01:25:34.84 --> 01:25:36.84 How long are those races?
01:25:36.84 --> 01:25:39.20 Well, they, uh, you have the regardless.
01:25:39.20 --> 01:25:44.64 And so if you're, like I was senior men in those, or about a mile and you have Boeys,
01:25:44.64 --> 01:25:46.44 you go around around.
01:25:46.44 --> 01:25:50.92 And then, uh, then you have the distance races after the, regardless season is over.
01:25:50.92 --> 01:25:57.12 And then you have the distance races, you know, there's one that runs from, um, Kylua to,
01:25:57.12 --> 01:26:00.24 uh, wakieke, twenty-something.
01:26:00.24 --> 01:26:05.000 And then the granddaddy of all the canoe races is the bullfight race.
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:12.16 So it goes from, Holly, a little, a harbor and, on, on, on, multi-two, uh, wakieke.
01:26:12.16 --> 01:26:16.76 And so, uh, and how big, uh, what, this is, uh, how many people are in the canoe?
01:26:16.76 --> 01:26:17.76 Six.
01:26:17.76 --> 01:26:21.60 And then, like when you do those long distance races, you have nine, nine people in the
01:26:21.60 --> 01:26:22.60 canoe.
01:26:22.60 --> 01:26:27.64 And, uh, you, three are resting.
01:26:27.64 --> 01:26:33.36 And then you just change and you make water changes as you go and you change every 20 minutes or
01:26:33.36 --> 01:26:34.36 so.
01:26:34.36 --> 01:26:37.16 And it's about a six hour race.
01:26:37.16 --> 01:26:40.92 So it's, you, you, you have to be in pretty good shape.
01:26:40.92 --> 01:26:47.24 But it's, but you do, you know, you just get, that how to do in all those races.
01:26:47.24 --> 01:26:54.96 Well the first year, we, uh, let me see, I guess, the first year we were really bummed,
01:26:54.96 --> 01:26:59.000 yeah, we, we got beat by wakieke's serve and outrigger.
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.20 We were third.
01:27:01.20 --> 01:27:07.32 And then the next year, we, we won it.
01:27:07.32 --> 01:27:10.24 And then the next year after that, we won it.
01:27:10.24 --> 01:27:16.80 And then, uh, and then my last year, um, I was up on the mainland starting to work for
01:27:16.80 --> 01:27:22.000 chart house, but they, they said I could come back and paddle with them and the multi-cateries.
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.68 So I went back and we, we did pretty well, but we didn't win it.
01:27:25.68 --> 01:27:28.24 But it was, it was a good race.
01:27:28.24 --> 01:27:32.12 And is that what your transition was out of, uh, teaching school going to work at the
01:27:32.12 --> 01:27:33.28 chart house?
01:27:33.28 --> 01:27:34.28 It was.
01:27:34.28 --> 01:27:39.52 Yeah, I was teaching, I was working on, I was waiting on tables in wakieke, uh, while I was teaching
01:27:39.52 --> 01:27:41.56 school, I worked at Chuck Stakehouse.
01:27:41.56 --> 01:27:45.04 Uh, was at the Outrigger hotel.
01:27:45.04 --> 01:27:50.000 And buzzers stake in lobster, who's down on beach, beachwalk.
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:58.08 And, um, yeah, I, I knew, I, I knew of, I wanted to go to work for, for the chart house, because
01:27:58.08 --> 01:28:04.52 there were a couple of UDT guys that were actually, there was one UDT guy and then Joey Cabell,
01:28:04.52 --> 01:28:10.16 who's a big time surfer that started the very first chart house in Aspen.
01:28:10.16 --> 01:28:11.56 And his name is Busy Bent.
01:28:11.56 --> 01:28:21.40 And then Busy and Ron Smith were classmates in UDT class 16, 16 or 19, but it was before
01:28:21.40 --> 01:28:22.40 me.
01:28:22.40 --> 01:28:28.84 And I became friends with Ron, who's a dynamic character and just a great personality.
01:28:28.84 --> 01:28:36.16 And he, and he was, at this point in the late 60s, he was, um, president of chart house.
01:28:36.16 --> 01:28:41.76 And then Busy was kind of retired and, uh, John was, uh, Ron was running the company.
01:28:41.76 --> 01:28:44.20 And that's, so I wrote him a letter.
01:28:44.20 --> 01:28:46.30 I said, he, I'm working at a steakhouse in W.E.
01:28:46.30 --> 01:28:47.10 K.E.
01:28:47.10 --> 01:28:48.10 You got an opening.
01:28:48.10 --> 01:28:49.30 And he says, sure.
01:28:49.30 --> 01:28:50.30 Yeah, come on.
01:28:50.30 --> 01:28:53.08 So I ended up working for the chart house.
01:28:53.08 --> 01:28:54.76 What, what did you do with the chart house?
01:28:54.76 --> 01:28:58.76 There was a chart house in Cornado when I was, when I was in Buds and when I got the
01:28:58.76 --> 01:29:02.40 sealed team one and man, I used to go to that chart house.
01:29:02.40 --> 01:29:03.40 I don't know.
01:29:03.40 --> 01:29:06.12 Like, once a week, maybe once every other,
01:29:06.12 --> 01:29:11.12 a week and get prime rib and it was weird because when I grew up, we didn't do a lot
01:29:11.12 --> 01:29:12.12 of steak when I was growing up.
01:29:12.12 --> 01:29:17.92 So I didn't even start liking steak and, and prime rib until I was like, in the
01:29:17.92 --> 01:29:19.92 Navy, because then I could buy it myself.
01:29:19.92 --> 01:29:20.92 Yeah.
01:29:20.92 --> 01:29:23.56 But we used to go, I used to go to chart house with my buddies.
01:29:23.56 --> 01:29:28.32 And, but we, and I knew, like, there was some, I had some knowledge that this was some
01:29:28.32 --> 01:29:30.12 kind of team guys that owned this thing.
01:29:30.12 --> 01:29:31.12 Yeah.
01:29:31.12 --> 01:29:33.12 But I never made any connections with everybody.
01:29:33.12 --> 01:29:37.56 I never, like, never talked to anybody, no one ever said anything about it.
01:29:37.56 --> 01:29:41.64 But so, were you involved in that chart house in the early 90s in Cornado?
01:29:41.64 --> 01:29:43.92 Well, I didn't before that.
01:29:43.92 --> 01:29:45.64 I started in 71.
01:29:45.64 --> 01:29:46.92 Oh, damn.
01:29:46.92 --> 01:29:48.64 The chart house has been around since the 70s.
01:29:48.64 --> 01:29:49.64 Yeah.
01:29:49.64 --> 01:29:50.76 I think they did the, oh, yeah.
01:29:50.76 --> 01:29:55.44 The first one, I mean, the last one was a, 1960, I think.
01:29:55.44 --> 01:29:59.12 I opened on July, July 4th.
01:29:59.12 --> 01:30:04.08 And then the second one was in Newport, and I remember, I was in the Navy when we
01:30:04.08 --> 01:30:07.36 ate it at the Newport one.
01:30:07.36 --> 01:30:10.60 And then that was the second one.
01:30:10.60 --> 01:30:14.40 And the third one was at Shelter Island.
01:30:14.40 --> 01:30:15.40 Okay.
01:30:15.40 --> 01:30:16.40 Yeah.
01:30:16.40 --> 01:30:17.40 Shelter Island.
01:30:17.40 --> 01:30:18.40 Okay.
01:30:18.40 --> 01:30:21.60 And that's when Ron joined the company.
01:30:21.60 --> 01:30:27.88 And yeah, he got out of the Navy about 64, 65, and then went to work because of
01:30:27.88 --> 01:30:28.88 the bussy.
01:30:28.88 --> 01:30:30.64 He and bussy were tight.
01:30:30.64 --> 01:30:32.92 And this is someone who said, then, bussy bent?
01:30:32.92 --> 01:30:33.92 Yeah.
01:30:33.92 --> 01:30:34.92 Not bussy Trent.
01:30:34.92 --> 01:30:35.92 Right.
01:30:35.92 --> 01:30:37.92 No, no, no, it's bussy bent.
01:30:37.92 --> 01:30:41.04 It was a great surfer himself.
01:30:41.04 --> 01:30:44.64 And so you were working as a waiter in Hawaii.
01:30:44.64 --> 01:30:45.64 Right.
01:30:45.64 --> 01:30:47.12 And you've read right these guys that led her, they're all team guys.
01:30:47.12 --> 01:30:48.12 You're an old team guy.
01:30:48.12 --> 01:30:49.12 Yeah.
01:30:49.12 --> 01:30:50.12 And they're like, yeah, we'll hire you.
01:30:50.12 --> 01:30:51.12 Yeah.
01:30:51.12 --> 01:30:52.12 Did you tell me you're a waiter?
01:30:52.12 --> 01:30:53.72 Did you tell me you had some big management position?
01:30:53.72 --> 01:30:54.72 No, I don't know.
01:30:54.72 --> 01:30:55.72 I don't know.
01:30:55.72 --> 01:30:56.72 I was a waiter.
01:30:56.72 --> 01:31:03.48 And I knew Ron fairly well at this point personally.
01:31:03.48 --> 01:31:08.24 And so he believed me.
01:31:08.24 --> 01:31:10.96 And so we had kind of a training program.
01:31:10.96 --> 01:31:13.76 This was in 71 when I came back.
01:31:13.76 --> 01:31:21.60 I came back from a little to Rdanda Beach and did a training program there for a few
01:31:21.60 --> 01:31:22.60 months.
01:31:22.60 --> 01:31:29.60 Then they ran and actually John Creed, the other guy who was an executive vice president,
01:31:29.60 --> 01:31:34.72 he was an old surf guy and water guy.
01:31:34.72 --> 01:31:42.96 And they said they were talking about, she would like to get a chart house in Hawaii.
01:31:42.96 --> 01:31:48.44 Because there was one there, but it wasn't part of the corporate chart house on the
01:31:48.44 --> 01:31:49.44 mainland.
01:31:49.44 --> 01:31:54.88 I said, well, gosh, you ought to buy a restaurant from Jerry McDonald.
01:31:54.88 --> 01:31:56.20 He has him on Maui.
01:31:56.20 --> 01:32:05.04 And so we ended up, so we ended up buying the sugar cane in, which is in Ohio.
01:32:05.04 --> 01:32:07.000 And then made a chart house out of that.
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.56 And that was my first real assignment with chart houses to go open that bill that
01:32:12.56 --> 01:32:14.28 get it ready for business.
01:32:14.28 --> 01:32:17.52 And that was my first kind of real assignment.
01:32:17.52 --> 01:32:19.40 And what you're with that?
01:32:19.40 --> 01:32:28.84 That was in 1972, is when we, because Danny was born in November of 1972, we went over
01:32:28.84 --> 01:32:33.52 in December of 1972 and bought the chart house.
01:32:33.52 --> 01:32:35.52 And then we stayed there.
01:32:35.52 --> 01:32:43.08 And actually I have to, I got acknowledge the heroic wife I had at that point.
01:32:43.08 --> 01:32:55.40 He gave birth to Danny on November 11th, 1972 and December 10th or 11th, we were on Maui.
01:32:55.40 --> 01:32:58.88 She was a month old child months after giving birth.
01:32:58.88 --> 01:33:02.68 We were opening a restaurant.
01:33:02.68 --> 01:33:08.16 She, she courageously charged through it and did great.
01:33:08.16 --> 01:33:11.72 But I know what else could it do to do that.
01:33:11.72 --> 01:33:14.80 So how long were you running that chart house?
01:33:14.80 --> 01:33:18.04 I ran that baby for about a year.
01:33:18.04 --> 01:33:32.68 And then I came back to the, oh yeah, and I came back to the mainland.
01:33:32.68 --> 01:33:34.44 Oh yeah, yeah, that's right.
01:33:34.44 --> 01:33:36.48 I ran that for about a year.
01:33:36.48 --> 01:33:42.36 And then about that time chart house was getting bought by another corporation.
01:33:42.36 --> 01:33:45.80 It was a big, it was a largest franchise, the Burger King restaurant.
01:33:45.80 --> 01:33:48.64 So they, they wanted to diversify.
01:33:48.64 --> 01:33:55.12 And so they bought the chart house at that point consisted of about seven or eight restaurants.
01:33:55.12 --> 01:34:02.08 And at that point, so they asked me to come back for that to be a kind of a regional manager
01:34:02.08 --> 01:34:03.48 guy in California.
01:34:03.48 --> 01:34:06.48 So we moved back.
01:34:06.48 --> 01:34:11.68 And again, it was almost the same sort of experience I hadn't balled him.
01:34:11.68 --> 01:34:13.52 I was getting pretty corporate guys.
01:34:13.52 --> 01:34:18.24 And so how about, can I go back to Maui?
01:34:18.24 --> 01:34:23.12 And so I went back to Maui and stayed there for quite a while.
01:34:23.12 --> 01:34:24.12 Still with the chart house.
01:34:24.12 --> 01:34:25.80 I still with the chart.
01:34:25.80 --> 01:34:32.32 Yeah, I went back there and then we ran the chart house that had opened a year earlier
01:34:32.32 --> 01:34:33.32 as a manager.
01:34:33.32 --> 01:34:38.96 So I, and then we started developing restaurants in the islands.
01:34:38.96 --> 01:34:42.56 And then I became kind of a regional guy out there then.
01:34:42.56 --> 01:34:46.12 And how long did you stick it out in that business?
01:34:46.12 --> 01:34:49.28 I stuck it out.
01:34:49.28 --> 01:34:51.28 I was there.
01:34:51.28 --> 01:34:53.28 Let me see, so so many.
01:34:53.28 --> 01:34:56.76 Because the restaurant business is really hard.
01:34:56.76 --> 01:34:59.20 Well, it, it is.
01:34:59.20 --> 01:35:04.92 Although as many of us from chart house, like to say, I wouldn't work for a restaurant company
01:35:04.92 --> 01:35:06.32 unless it was a chart house.
01:35:06.32 --> 01:35:10.12 I mean, chart house was pretty, well, you just described it.
01:35:10.12 --> 01:35:13.000 It's a special place and it was.
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.88 And to, in fact, today, even though chart house is no longer an existence, there was
01:35:19.88 --> 01:35:30.92 a kind of a Facebook group that has the old chart house employees, friends and so on.
01:35:30.92 --> 01:35:33.96 And their boy, they're just, it's a great group.
01:35:33.96 --> 01:35:36.000 They're very dedicated to the chart house.
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.12 And he said, I remember it goes to when this happened and somebody fell in their face
01:35:40.12 --> 01:35:42.12 and the avocado dip.
01:35:42.12 --> 01:35:43.12 Yeah.
01:35:43.12 --> 01:35:49.000 And it's just, so there's a lot of history there that gets retolded in Facebook forms.
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.60 Well, how long did you stick with it then?
01:35:51.60 --> 01:36:00.60 And then, well, I stuck with it until about 76, and then I built my own restaurant up in
01:36:00.60 --> 01:36:01.88 Marko Wow.
01:36:01.88 --> 01:36:05.32 And I just made it, I just ripped the chart house off.
01:36:05.32 --> 01:36:06.72 We had a salad bar.
01:36:06.72 --> 01:36:11.32 Yeah, we had our deal and, but it took off.
01:36:11.32 --> 01:36:12.32 It was a great restaurant.
01:36:12.32 --> 01:36:14.76 Very, very busy.
01:36:14.76 --> 01:36:17.84 And so we ran that for a while.
01:36:17.84 --> 01:36:22.68 We were living in Laena and it was about a 45 minute drive up to Marko Wow.
01:36:22.68 --> 01:36:26.16 And it was, I wouldn't, I was kind of getting tired of that.
01:36:26.16 --> 01:36:31.000 So I asked the chart house guys if they wanted to sell any chart houses.
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.96 So I ended up buying another chart house right outside of Boston in Dr. Perry, Massachusetts.
01:36:37.96 --> 01:36:44.28 And again, my courageous wife who was pregnant with our youngest child.
01:36:44.28 --> 01:36:50.20 And we loaded up and went there and ran that restaurant for about a year.
01:36:50.20 --> 01:36:59.88 And then, our little baby Dougie was born there.
01:36:59.88 --> 01:37:07.92 And then we, and then chart house, they ended up buying that chart house.
01:37:07.92 --> 01:37:14.44 That restaurant back from me and then offered me a job back with the company in California
01:37:14.44 --> 01:37:18.76 because they were going to do a leverage buyout from Pillsbury by this time Pillsbury
01:37:18.76 --> 01:37:21.84 on the chart house.
01:37:21.84 --> 01:37:23.44 And they were going to do a leverage buyout.
01:37:23.44 --> 01:37:27.52 So the ASM came on back and helped, helped with that.
01:37:27.52 --> 01:37:28.52 So where did you go?
01:37:28.52 --> 01:37:29.52 Where did you move back to?
01:37:29.52 --> 01:37:30.52 Cornado.
01:37:30.52 --> 01:37:31.52 Back to Cornado.
01:37:31.52 --> 01:37:32.52 And what year was that?
01:37:32.52 --> 01:37:33.52 85.
01:37:33.52 --> 01:37:37.28 And now you're still working with chart house.
01:37:37.28 --> 01:37:39.52 Yeah, are you having to go to the restaurants every day?
01:37:39.52 --> 01:37:40.52 What are you doing?
01:37:40.52 --> 01:37:42.76 Well, I was a regional manager guy.
01:37:42.76 --> 01:37:47.52 And then, oh, I was in their training department for a while.
01:37:47.52 --> 01:37:49.84 And then I was a regional manager guy.
01:37:49.84 --> 01:37:54.44 And my region is living in Coronado.
01:37:54.44 --> 01:37:58.76 But my region was in Hawaii and Colorado.
01:37:58.76 --> 01:38:01.76 And so I had three fairly nice places.
01:38:01.76 --> 01:38:04.60 I was going to say rough, rough tours.
01:38:04.60 --> 01:38:05.60 rough tour.
01:38:05.60 --> 01:38:08.92 How long did you stick with that for?
01:38:08.92 --> 01:38:16.66 That up until like time Sam Zell bought the chart house, which was in 1998 or something
01:38:16.66 --> 01:38:18.38 like that.
01:38:18.38 --> 01:38:21.32 And Sam Zell, he's a huge real estate guy.
01:38:21.32 --> 01:38:24.92 And she's losing the biggest real estate owner in the world or something like that.
01:38:24.92 --> 01:38:25.92 Like that.
01:38:25.92 --> 01:38:30.96 Yeah, I mean, I was talking with an accountant, the new him in Chicago.
01:38:30.96 --> 01:38:37.42 And she said that the saying in Chicago was that Sam jumped out of a 20-story building
01:38:37.42 --> 01:38:38.42 unit in jump after him.
01:38:38.42 --> 01:38:42.48 Because he's probably going to make money on the way down.
01:38:42.48 --> 01:38:52.28 So I started with that until 1998.
01:38:52.28 --> 01:39:02.44 And then I moved back to Coronado.
01:39:02.44 --> 01:39:06.96 And then Danny, my other boy, said that the lunch come much be a lake.
01:39:06.96 --> 01:39:08.92 And I said, geez, really.
01:39:08.92 --> 01:39:11.24 OK, so was he a lifeguard at this time?
01:39:11.24 --> 01:39:12.60 Yeah, he was at North Island.
01:39:12.60 --> 01:39:13.24 We were.
01:39:13.24 --> 01:39:15.12 And how old are you at this point?
01:39:15.12 --> 01:39:22.12 I was about to turn 50 or 60.
01:39:22.12 --> 01:39:24.08 I was about to turn 60.
01:39:24.08 --> 01:39:26.36 And he's tell you, you should become a lifeguard.
01:39:26.36 --> 01:39:27.36 Yeah.
01:39:27.36 --> 01:39:28.36 And so I went through really hard training.
01:39:28.36 --> 01:39:32.88 So this whole time, are you just in the water still and you're still working out?
01:39:32.88 --> 01:39:34.36 Are you still training?
01:39:34.36 --> 01:39:35.88 Like, how are you staying in group?
01:39:35.88 --> 01:39:41.32 I was thinking about going to a lifeguard academy at age 55 or 60 or 50.
01:39:41.32 --> 01:39:42.84 Even 40, whatever.
01:39:42.84 --> 01:39:46.08 Whatever, it was.
01:39:46.08 --> 01:39:48.08 I'm not sure.
01:39:48.08 --> 01:39:50.76 I think I went through in 1999, so I guess that's 60.
01:39:50.76 --> 01:39:51.76 Yeah, that's 60.
01:39:51.76 --> 01:39:52.76 Yeah.
01:39:52.76 --> 01:39:54.04 So you're 60 years old going through the lifeguard academy?
01:39:54.04 --> 01:39:57.52 Well, I think I was a couple of years younger, so I was in my late 50s.
01:39:57.52 --> 01:39:58.52 OK.
01:39:58.52 --> 01:40:01.56 And how are you staying in shape all this time?
01:40:01.56 --> 01:40:02.56 Oh, I worked out.
01:40:02.56 --> 01:40:04.88 So you work out every day, religiously.
01:40:04.88 --> 01:40:09.60 Yeah, even now is, and I'm about as decrepit as you can get.
01:40:09.60 --> 01:40:13.16 But I do something.
01:40:13.16 --> 01:40:14.56 It's an embarrassment.
01:40:14.56 --> 01:40:17.52 People laugh at me as I go down the beach and everything.
01:40:17.52 --> 01:40:18.84 That's tough.
01:40:18.84 --> 01:40:22.72 Now, how well, what you're eating when you're working at all these restaurants, you've
01:40:22.72 --> 01:40:28.12 got free access to all kinds of food all day and night, how are you not just power it
01:40:28.12 --> 01:40:33.36 into those, that freaking hot brown bread that they used to have in the trade house.
01:40:33.36 --> 01:40:34.36 Right?
01:40:34.36 --> 01:40:37.92 How are you not freaking putting off like 80 pounds of excess fat from that?
01:40:37.92 --> 01:40:41.60 Well, I think that's really my motive for working out.
01:40:41.60 --> 01:40:45.84 Is that, hey, if you work out hard enough to eat anything, you want it.
01:40:45.84 --> 01:40:52.72 And I said, in order to keep my eating lifestyle functioning and flourishing, then I work
01:40:52.72 --> 01:40:53.72 out.
01:40:53.72 --> 01:40:58.96 But lately, you know, I've got these children that are Nazis about food.
01:40:58.96 --> 01:41:00.48 I can't eat this.
01:41:00.48 --> 01:41:02.36 I can't eat that.
01:41:02.36 --> 01:41:06.80 So I'm a little more disciplined.
01:41:06.80 --> 01:41:10.12 So how many hours a day would you say you worked out?
01:41:10.12 --> 01:41:12.24 Like when you were, let's just say you're 40 years old.
01:41:12.24 --> 01:41:13.56 You're working at the Charter House.
01:41:13.56 --> 01:41:14.84 How many hours a day you're working out?
01:41:14.84 --> 01:41:17.36 You're going for an hour run to hour run.
01:41:17.36 --> 01:41:19.84 You're doing PT on the B-20 doing it.
01:41:19.84 --> 01:41:22.24 Well, we got into cycling too.
01:41:22.24 --> 01:41:26.24 And cyclists, they're really crazy.
01:41:26.24 --> 01:41:30.08 And so I got a little bit of French craziness out of that.
01:41:30.08 --> 01:41:36.60 We would ride, well, like my daughter and I did a, we've got a tandem bike and we rode
01:41:36.60 --> 01:41:43.48 from Aspen, Colorado to Tauce, in Mexico, which is about 250 miles.
01:41:43.48 --> 01:41:49.36 And then we rode from there to, well, we drove down to Albuquerque.
01:41:49.36 --> 01:41:52.12 And then we rode from Albuquerque back to San Diego.
01:41:52.12 --> 01:41:54.28 And she was right there with me.
01:41:54.28 --> 01:42:00.12 And we did, I don't know, hundreds of some a day, something like that.
01:42:00.12 --> 01:42:03.92 But those were, that's more long.
01:42:03.92 --> 01:42:14.60 And I think the most important thing for me is the consistency of working out.
01:42:14.60 --> 01:42:18.24 And I have a friend.
01:42:18.24 --> 01:42:21.12 He says, motion is lotion.
01:42:21.12 --> 01:42:26.48 And you know, if you keep moving, you're going to be all right.
01:42:26.48 --> 01:42:27.72 And it's like this morning.
01:42:27.72 --> 01:42:35.04 And I hadn't been in the water for a few weeks.
01:42:35.04 --> 01:42:36.96 And when I went to bed last night, I said, you're in Coronado.
01:42:36.96 --> 01:42:40.08 The first thing you knew to tomorrow is you'd get on your paddleboard and you'd go for
01:42:40.08 --> 01:42:42.08 paddle.
01:42:42.08 --> 01:42:48.04 And paddling is important for me because, like I said, I'm pretty decreed and kind of a
01:42:48.04 --> 01:42:49.28 physical disgrace.
01:42:49.28 --> 01:42:53.84 But I can still paddle, I hope.
01:42:53.84 --> 01:42:55.48 And we're going to find out tomorrow morning.
01:42:55.48 --> 01:43:01.64 So that I did go for a paddle this morning for about half an hour, 45 minutes.
01:43:01.64 --> 01:43:04.56 And then I intend to lengthen that out.
01:43:04.56 --> 01:43:10.52 But I spend some time in towels and the problem there is the paddling isn't, I mean,
01:43:10.52 --> 01:43:11.52 it can be done.
01:43:11.52 --> 01:43:13.08 But you have to go down to the rear of rain.
01:43:13.08 --> 01:43:14.96 River, which is, which I'm happy to do.
01:43:14.96 --> 01:43:19.40 But in the winter is a little nippy, you know.
01:43:19.40 --> 01:43:23.52 So when I go back, I'll probably go back next week.
01:43:23.52 --> 01:43:29.44 But I'm going to get the paddling because I got in the boy my first couple strokes off
01:43:29.44 --> 01:43:30.68 on my board this morning.
01:43:30.68 --> 01:43:32.80 It was like the tin man in the house.
01:43:32.80 --> 01:43:37.40 Man, you couldn't, she's too weird.
01:43:37.40 --> 01:43:40.64 You could hear the sirens going on.
01:43:40.64 --> 01:43:43.12 People call 911 this, Gaser.
01:43:43.12 --> 01:43:45.56 Yeah, this Gaser, he just pulled away from the dock.
01:43:45.56 --> 01:43:48.24 I don't think he's going to make it.
01:43:48.24 --> 01:43:55.36 But you know what, the miracle of paddling is by gum after about 15 or 20 minutes.
01:43:55.36 --> 01:43:58.60 The pains that I was feeling was first couple strokes.
01:43:58.60 --> 01:44:00.72 I didn't feel him anymore.
01:44:00.72 --> 01:44:05.44 And you know, okay, I'm gonna pick it up here a little bit and gee, by the end of it,
01:44:05.44 --> 01:44:08.20 I felt like he felt fine.
01:44:08.20 --> 01:44:11.28 So that's the nice solution, I guess.
01:44:11.28 --> 01:44:12.28 Exactly.
01:44:12.28 --> 01:44:15.24 So you end up going through lifeguard academy.
01:44:15.24 --> 01:44:16.24 Yep.
01:44:16.24 --> 01:44:18.16 And you actually become a lifeguard?
01:44:18.16 --> 01:44:19.16 Yeah, it becomes your job.
01:44:19.16 --> 01:44:20.16 You know what?
01:44:20.16 --> 01:44:27.56 I realized that I was kind of, I had about 10 years in with the North Island.
01:44:27.56 --> 01:44:34.76 And then I got fired because this lady took over the all lifeguard and she found that
01:44:34.76 --> 01:44:38.68 that we were drinking beer in the tower at three and I won with them.
01:44:38.68 --> 01:44:44.92 But some of these young fellows were a little less disciplined and got busted.
01:44:44.92 --> 01:44:52.84 And so I always part of that great, um, helly, and got so, you know, I ended up.
01:44:52.84 --> 01:44:54.64 So you got fired as a lifeguard.
01:44:54.64 --> 01:45:00.52 Now you're what you were like 60 years old, 60 something years old for being a miscreen
01:45:00.52 --> 01:45:01.52 drinking beer on the job.
01:45:01.52 --> 01:45:04.04 I was getting the house getting in my 60s.
01:45:04.04 --> 01:45:06.96 I, and I wasn't, I wasn't even part of the fire.
01:45:06.96 --> 01:45:07.96 I just fired everybody.
01:45:07.96 --> 01:45:11.24 Well, she fired that group.
01:45:11.24 --> 01:45:14.84 And then I was up, it was in New Mexico or something.
01:45:14.84 --> 01:45:18.28 And I came back and I wanted my job back and she just wouldn't give it back to me.
01:45:18.28 --> 01:45:23.28 So I guess I didn't actually get fired, but I sure didn't get a rear.
01:45:23.28 --> 01:45:29.04 So then Coronado, I don't know if Sean Kerry, who's the captain down there, there's
01:45:29.04 --> 01:45:31.24 a wonderful human being.
01:45:31.24 --> 01:45:39.36 And he said, he said, he said, well, Doug, you know, I tried out that same, that same
01:45:39.36 --> 01:45:40.36 thing.
01:45:40.36 --> 01:45:44.96 Yeah, we both, they say, yeah, it was one, it was a human youngest son, try out for
01:45:44.96 --> 01:45:46.96 the lifeguards at the same time.
01:45:46.96 --> 01:45:51.44 Yeah, were we, was that the summer before you got married?
01:45:51.44 --> 01:45:53.76 Yeah, I think it was.
01:45:53.76 --> 01:45:54.76 I think it was.
01:45:54.76 --> 01:45:56.44 Yeah, he and I go, oh yeah, that was it.
01:45:56.44 --> 01:46:04.000 No, we're eight of us that were going to be applying to be a lifeguard job.
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:14.60 And so the guy that was running the PT stuff that we had to do in order to qualify,
01:46:14.60 --> 01:46:19.20 he had us all up and then, and the first thing was a swim, I got to the buoy and back,
01:46:19.20 --> 01:46:23.64 and then we had to run up the beach to the other end of the beach, you know, 150 yards or
01:46:23.64 --> 01:46:24.96 something like that.
01:46:24.96 --> 01:46:28.20 And then there were a couple of little deals like that.
01:46:28.20 --> 01:46:33.68 And remember, there were eight of us, and half of our girls.
01:46:33.68 --> 01:46:40.56 And Dougie was first on all the events, and I was last on all the events.
01:46:40.56 --> 01:46:46.68 And I remember after that, first one, he went running up the beach, and I got to, and
01:46:46.68 --> 01:46:49.16 there was Dougie was at the finish line already.
01:46:49.16 --> 01:46:53.000 He was tall, though, I think he's right having a sandwich by the time I got there.
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.56 And so I finally got there.
01:46:55.56 --> 01:46:58.76 And then this guy was timing it.
01:46:58.76 --> 01:47:06.72 I kind of bent over, holding myself up, I'm propin' myself up on the knees, and I kind
01:47:06.72 --> 01:47:10.60 of saw him out mouth to Dougie, I said, I did that.
01:47:10.60 --> 01:47:13.76 He said, yeah, you're good, you're good.
01:47:13.76 --> 01:47:17.08 So I guess I got there just in time.
01:47:17.08 --> 01:47:20.12 But so then they hired me.
01:47:20.12 --> 01:47:30.08 And then the second year, and I was hired with a city, and then the next year, I was
01:47:30.08 --> 01:47:33.44 off for the wintertime, because they let everybody go.
01:47:33.44 --> 01:47:39.48 But the next, that summer I was invited back, and I went down to the tower, and I said,
01:47:39.48 --> 01:47:42.36 kind of, do we have that PT stuff?
01:47:42.36 --> 01:47:47.64 I saw you guys start training for that, and the sergeant there at the time, he says, no,
01:47:47.64 --> 01:47:51.56 you've already been on, you don't have to do that.
01:47:51.56 --> 01:47:55.56 Those events say him more.
01:47:55.56 --> 01:48:01.12 It's like I say, you know, God has had a hand and spared me through a lot of stuff, but
01:48:01.12 --> 01:48:02.12 I didn't have to.
01:48:02.12 --> 01:48:06.20 So I stayed on for about 10 years.
01:48:06.20 --> 01:48:13.64 And then about a year and a half ago, two years, I guess, I've missed a couple of summers,
01:48:13.64 --> 01:48:15.64 and it's a heartbreak.
01:48:15.64 --> 01:48:23.12 I tried by there and wistfully look out at the tower I used to work in, and I wish I had
01:48:23.12 --> 01:48:27.76 my old job back, but it's a hearing deal.
01:48:27.76 --> 01:48:39.56 Some doctor just jab me on the hearing, he said, I couldn't hear certain voices because
01:48:39.56 --> 01:48:41.68 they were a certain range.
01:48:41.68 --> 01:48:46.72 And so anyhow, I couldn't qualify as a lifeguard anymore.
01:48:46.72 --> 01:48:55.12 And I argued that, well, I'm not sure that hearing is that big a part of lifeguard, but
01:48:55.12 --> 01:48:56.68 anyhow I can't find so.
01:48:56.68 --> 01:48:59.40 Yeah, I walked away, begrudgingly.
01:48:59.40 --> 01:49:03.92 Now, it seems like a long the way I've talked to some of the, I guess it's the next
01:49:03.92 --> 01:49:09.56 generation, maybe a seal's a little bit younger than me, maybe 10 years behind me.
01:49:09.56 --> 01:49:13.36 And I guess it's when you were in Cornado that you developed a bunch of relationships
01:49:13.36 --> 01:49:17.72 and mentored a bunch of these, the next generation guys coming up, they all love you.
01:49:17.72 --> 01:49:19.72 Well, they were wonderful guys.
01:49:19.72 --> 01:49:22.32 I mean, I should have all come about.
01:49:22.32 --> 01:49:34.92 Well, lifeguarding, there was Sam was at the beach, peppers at the beach.
01:49:34.92 --> 01:49:46.12 And then Charlie, who was Charlie Keating, who, wow, he, I've known him because he was a
01:49:46.12 --> 01:49:52.44 Sony and he would come over and he's just this wonderful kid.
01:49:52.44 --> 01:49:55.44 And he started coming over when he was like 13, 14 years old.
01:49:55.44 --> 01:49:59.44 And then that's what you remember him Chuck Keating when he was 13, 14 years old.
01:49:59.44 --> 01:50:00.44 Yeah, because he was a little older.
01:50:00.44 --> 01:50:01.44 Yeah, because he was a little older.
01:50:01.44 --> 01:50:02.44 Yeah, because he was a little older.
01:50:02.44 --> 01:50:05.44 And I would say it, my house.
01:50:05.44 --> 01:50:06.44 Okay.
01:50:06.44 --> 01:50:07.44 We're dug a way out of you.
01:50:07.44 --> 01:50:08.44 How did you, how did that happen?
01:50:08.44 --> 01:50:17.12 Well, well, his cousin Bobby and Mikey were, their names were a lot.
01:50:17.12 --> 01:50:19.80 But they're Keating family and kids.
01:50:19.80 --> 01:50:21.80 And Charlie was one of their cousins.
01:50:21.80 --> 01:50:26.16 God, one of their 800 cousins, you know, and Catholics, you know.
01:50:26.16 --> 01:50:34.000 So, they, but so that's how I got acquainted with Charlie and became a dear friend and
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.88 wonderful guy, you know, just just a great guy.
01:50:36.88 --> 01:50:41.76 And so in the summers, it sounds from talking to some of his friends that you are kind
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:46.76 of the reason he decided to go in the teams.
01:50:46.76 --> 01:50:48.52 I, I, not aware of that.
01:50:48.52 --> 01:50:49.76 I, necessarily.
01:50:49.76 --> 01:50:56.12 I knew, well, his dad did call me and said, hey, Lance, Charlie is talking about going
01:50:56.12 --> 01:50:58.12 in the teams to you.
01:50:58.12 --> 01:51:01.36 I said, can you, I said, well, I'll do anything I can.
01:51:01.36 --> 01:51:04.16 So I looked at, I think I found a name or something.
01:51:04.16 --> 01:51:11.20 I didn't do much of anything or a way except refer to somebody who really could help him.
01:51:11.20 --> 01:51:13.48 And so that's how he got in the teams.
01:51:13.48 --> 01:51:16.96 And then, but I'm real close with that whole family.
01:51:16.96 --> 01:51:26.36 And Charlie, who was killed, his dad's name, his name is Charlie also.
01:51:26.36 --> 01:51:28.64 And he knew about my brother, Danny.
01:51:28.64 --> 01:51:37.08 And so there's, and then Charlie's brother, Billy, is also in the teams or was in the
01:51:37.08 --> 01:51:38.08 teams.
01:51:38.08 --> 01:51:40.56 I think he's getting out.
01:51:40.56 --> 01:51:47.56 I knew about my brother and so there's a, there's a kinship there that we, we feel as
01:51:47.56 --> 01:51:49.08 family.
01:51:49.08 --> 01:51:54.16 And we, you know, we, we stay in touch.
01:51:54.16 --> 01:52:02.88 And on May, I think it's May 3rd, is that when Charlie was killed in 2016, was that 2016,
01:52:02.88 --> 01:52:04.52 he was killed.
01:52:04.52 --> 01:52:08.40 And so, waiting how Charlie and I, you know, when I go to Rhodes Grands, I'll take
01:52:08.40 --> 01:52:13.60 a picture and send it to him and, and that's one thing good about these damn iPhones, you
01:52:13.60 --> 01:52:17.96 know, you can communicate boom when you want to, you know.
01:52:17.96 --> 01:52:22.20 And yeah, he's definitely a special guy.
01:52:22.20 --> 01:52:28.64 I mean, I, when he was coming up in the teams, you know, I was in a position where I was
01:52:28.64 --> 01:52:31.28 teaching land war for him stuff like that.
01:52:31.28 --> 01:52:32.28 So, you know.
01:52:32.28 --> 01:52:34.96 And so, I, I would see faces, you know, I'd see guys.
01:52:34.96 --> 01:52:39.24 But unless someone was either really good or really bad, I probably wouldn't remember
01:52:39.24 --> 01:52:43.40 me and, you know, he was, you know, one of the guys, I remember this guy.
01:52:43.40 --> 01:52:48.44 And, but man, like some of the, like the stories you hear about about Chuck is just like
01:52:48.44 --> 01:52:50.68 he was just freaking epic guy.
01:52:50.68 --> 01:52:51.68 Um, yeah.
01:52:51.68 --> 01:52:55.20 And he's one of those guys, you know, you look at all these pictures of them that you just,
01:52:55.20 --> 01:53:01.44 you just know that this guy was just such an awesome guy to have in your cartoon.
01:53:01.44 --> 01:53:07.16 And he left such a mark on so many of the team guy buddies of his and got a great thing
01:53:07.16 --> 01:53:08.16 going now.
01:53:08.16 --> 01:53:12.84 They got the C4 Ranch up here in San Diego, which is a beautiful place, a bunch of awesome
01:53:12.84 --> 01:53:13.84 people.
01:53:13.84 --> 01:53:19.32 And it gives, gives guys a place to be able to go and unwind and take their families and spend
01:53:19.32 --> 01:53:21.08 time in nature and all that kind of stuff.
01:53:21.08 --> 01:53:28.20 So, the, his, his name is, is living on and he's still helping the, his brother seals
01:53:28.20 --> 01:53:29.76 through that thing that he's doing.
01:53:29.76 --> 01:53:32.20 Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.
01:53:32.20 --> 01:53:34.12 It's a great legacy.
01:53:34.12 --> 01:53:35.76 And very worthwhile.
01:53:35.76 --> 01:53:43.64 And, and I know his dad's involved and then, uh, broke his wife, I think he's really involved.
01:53:43.64 --> 01:53:45.20 So, yeah, it's, it's important.
01:53:45.20 --> 01:53:46.20 It's significant.
01:53:46.20 --> 01:53:50.20 And, that, yeah, they found a great piece of property up there.
01:53:50.20 --> 01:53:56.12 And I think it, I think it's, sir, sir, uh, it's filling out the mission in a great way.
01:53:56.12 --> 01:53:57.12 Yeah, yep.
01:53:57.12 --> 01:53:58.12 Yep.
01:53:58.12 --> 01:54:02.88 You retired, I guess, from the lifeguarding thing, that's what happened.
01:54:02.88 --> 01:54:05.36 And so, and so, what do you up to now?
01:54:05.36 --> 01:54:09.24 Uh, you know, that's kind of a problem.
01:54:09.24 --> 01:54:12.80 Uh, drinking beer with the, well, drink beer with the youngs.
01:54:12.80 --> 01:54:21.52 Yeah, I, I, I, I, I lately, uh, I spend more time feeling sorry for myself than I
01:54:21.52 --> 01:54:22.52 should, you know.
01:54:22.52 --> 01:54:31.000 And, and then Doug, and I, we were talking, and, um, we, uh, actually, um, I got involved
01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:39.80 with, with Doug, um, my son, who, and then this guy Sam, uh, Blair down in Louisiana, uh,
01:54:39.80 --> 01:54:42.24 who was in the teams and then moved to Louisiana.
01:54:42.24 --> 01:54:49.40 And they, they started talking about, uh, developing, um, a coffee company.
01:54:49.40 --> 01:54:52.84 And, uh, and Doug, you know, we're just chatting about it.
01:54:52.84 --> 01:55:00.60 And, uh, and I started thinking, God, it's just a, the wonderful thing that's coming to
01:55:00.60 --> 01:55:02.76 me that I can participate in.
01:55:02.76 --> 01:55:08.24 And so, though you, as asked me to, well, we, we just chat, we just naturally assume that
01:55:08.24 --> 01:55:15.52 I would have a, a small role in nothing too responsible, or that requires any talent or anything.
01:55:15.52 --> 01:55:19.72 But something that I could be involved with myself with.
01:55:19.72 --> 01:55:27.30 And, uh, I mean, it was, uh, the God thing again, you know, maybe it is a blessing of
01:55:27.30 --> 01:55:28.30 sort.
01:55:28.30 --> 01:55:33.88 So, we've just been filling around with it for a few weeks, but, um, we, we want to start
01:55:33.88 --> 01:55:34.84 to coffee company.
01:55:34.84 --> 01:55:40.72 And, um, and because we're pretty sure we've got a great source.
01:55:40.72 --> 01:55:50.08 There's a guy down at Louisiana who is the sole importer of this, uh, of this coffee,
01:55:50.08 --> 01:55:51.76 and it's growing in Honduras.
01:55:51.76 --> 01:55:56.60 And the only, only, the only importer in the U.S. is importing this coffee.
01:55:56.60 --> 01:56:00.52 And it's coming from Louisiana, which I love, you know, it's cost of, like, from New
01:56:00.52 --> 01:56:01.52 Orleans.
01:56:01.52 --> 01:56:03.16 I mean, going, you know.
01:56:03.16 --> 01:56:06.76 And so, uh, it's all sort of coming together.
01:56:06.76 --> 01:56:15.40 And, um, and so at 82 soon to be 83, you know, there were, there were times, because
01:56:15.40 --> 01:56:20.08 like my, my roommate from Tulane, who was 83, great deal older than me.
01:56:20.08 --> 01:56:21.76 He was 83.
01:56:21.76 --> 01:56:25.76 And he's told me he says, hey, man, you don't, you don't want to be 83.
01:56:25.76 --> 01:56:26.76 That's really rough.
01:56:26.76 --> 01:56:36.72 You know, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's just telling me.
01:56:36.72 --> 01:56:38.72 That, uh, it's not good.
01:56:38.72 --> 01:56:44.000 So there are a couple of, ever since I got, couldn't make, couldn't pass a hearing
01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.16 taste test because I'm so, God damn old.
01:56:47.16 --> 01:56:49.96 And so I can't pass a hearing test.
01:56:49.96 --> 01:56:53.12 I can no longer do what I love to do.
01:56:53.12 --> 01:56:54.12 And, uh, be with people.
01:56:54.12 --> 01:56:55.12 I love to be.
01:56:55.12 --> 01:56:57.16 And, you know, I'd wake up in the morning.
01:56:57.16 --> 01:57:03.48 And I, and I, I remember one morning, I woke up and I looked, you know, I just kind
01:57:03.48 --> 01:57:08.52 of look at over the side of my bed and I could see, I can see some dust balls under this
01:57:08.52 --> 01:57:15.56 table near my bed and I said, you know, that's probably about the most important thing
01:57:15.56 --> 01:57:17.20 you got on your list to do.
01:57:17.20 --> 01:57:18.20 It's clean.
01:57:18.20 --> 01:57:20.20 It's got damn puff balls up.
01:57:20.20 --> 01:57:22.96 And I said, man, life's got to be better than this.
01:57:22.96 --> 01:57:24.24 We got to do something.
01:57:24.24 --> 01:57:31.88 And so, when we started talking about developing a coffee company, um, I, I'm really excited
01:57:31.88 --> 01:57:32.88 about it.
01:57:32.88 --> 01:57:40.52 And I'm with, uh, I probably wanted to create a guy's, I know, with my fourth child.
01:57:40.52 --> 01:57:46.40 And, uh, he's artistic and comes up with great ideas and he's an entrepreneurial and
01:57:46.40 --> 01:57:47.40 spirit.
01:57:47.40 --> 01:57:48.40 Uh, yeah.
01:57:48.40 --> 01:57:49.40 Hell yeah.
01:57:49.40 --> 01:57:54.56 Well, we're going to make a coffee company by Gale.
01:57:54.56 --> 01:57:59.12 And, uh, so it's obviously, we've just starting it.
01:57:59.12 --> 01:58:00.64 We think it's going to be great.
01:58:00.64 --> 01:58:02.88 Well, we know it's going to be great.
01:58:02.88 --> 01:58:05.56 But, uh, and, you know, I'm, that's what I'm doing now.
01:58:05.56 --> 01:58:06.56 I'm a coffee guy now.
01:58:06.56 --> 01:58:10.56 I'm kind of the Colonel Sanders of coffee.
01:58:10.56 --> 01:58:11.56 Yeah.
01:58:11.56 --> 01:58:12.56 I'm pretty excited.
01:58:12.56 --> 01:58:15.92 What's the idea of the coffee company to get a big, called big yellow coffee?
01:58:15.92 --> 01:58:16.92 Big yellow.
01:58:16.92 --> 01:58:18.64 What's that all about?
01:58:18.64 --> 01:58:23.36 Well, you, you didn't want to wear a bit when you, when you came up to us as we were
01:58:23.36 --> 01:58:25.000 out in the parking lot, but my van.
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.88 Oh, the van is a big yellow.
01:58:26.88 --> 01:58:27.88 Big yellow.
01:58:27.88 --> 01:58:31.84 I had that puppy since Dougie was a junior in high school.
01:58:31.84 --> 01:58:39.88 And so, um, it, uh, so that we got, and, you know, because, like I said, the guys are
01:58:39.88 --> 01:58:43.84 artistic as hell, he designed the coffee bag for it and everything.
01:58:43.84 --> 01:58:47.72 And, uh, it's the big yellow coffee company.
01:58:47.72 --> 01:58:52.40 And if you don't think the coffee isn't going to go flying off the shelf, man, you
01:58:52.40 --> 01:58:53.40 haven't lived.
01:58:53.40 --> 01:58:54.64 It's going to be great.
01:58:54.64 --> 01:59:03.16 I, I, I really, from what I know about coffee, I expect to know a lot more from now on,
01:59:03.16 --> 01:59:08.92 you know, but, uh, I, the, the, the components sound good.
01:59:08.92 --> 01:59:17.24 I mean, this guy is a soul, um, the importer of the coffee of this particular coffee from, uh,
01:59:17.24 --> 01:59:18.24 Honduras.
01:59:18.24 --> 01:59:24.60 And the thing that's really significant about this coffee guy is that he's the only one
01:59:24.60 --> 01:59:26.72 that we're going to buy coffee from.
01:59:26.72 --> 01:59:33.60 And we're, uh, we don't, we're not going to buy, like, you know, he's a soul, uh,
01:59:33.60 --> 01:59:34.60 distributor.
01:59:34.60 --> 01:59:37.04 This kind of a soul grow, right?
01:59:37.04 --> 01:59:38.68 Yeah, he's a kind of Honduras.
01:59:38.68 --> 01:59:39.68 He's a kind of Honduras.
01:59:39.68 --> 01:59:40.68 He's a kind of Honduras.
01:59:40.68 --> 01:59:41.68 He's a kind of Honduras.
01:59:41.68 --> 01:59:47.08 Yeah, it's going to be a single, single origin, um, source.
01:59:47.08 --> 01:59:50.56 Do we have a, do we have a website yet?
01:59:50.56 --> 01:59:52.08 It's in, in the works.
01:59:52.08 --> 01:59:53.08 In the works.
01:59:53.08 --> 01:59:54.08 Yeah.
01:59:54.08 --> 01:59:55.32 What's the, what's the website?
01:59:55.32 --> 01:59:56.44 Big yellow coffee.
01:59:56.44 --> 01:59:58.12 Big yellow coffee.
01:59:58.12 --> 01:59:59.12 Yeah.
01:59:59.12 --> 02:00:00.12 Yeah.
02:00:00.12 --> 02:00:05.72 And if, uh, if you can't get through right away, just be patient, uh, you'll be able
02:00:05.72 --> 02:00:06.72 to get it.
02:00:06.72 --> 02:00:11.92 Well, it sounds like that brings us up to present date.
02:00:11.92 --> 02:00:13.52 Probably probably good place to stop.
02:00:13.52 --> 02:00:15.52 Uh, we have to give echo.
02:00:15.52 --> 02:00:16.52 Yes.
02:00:16.52 --> 02:00:17.52 The opportunity.
02:00:17.52 --> 02:00:19.92 You know, I'm sure there's some maybe some Hawaiian questions coming up.
02:00:19.92 --> 02:00:20.92 Oh, I sure we got.
02:00:20.92 --> 02:00:21.92 Sure.

02:00:27.76 --> 02:00:28.92 Well, it was, it was mine.
02:00:28.92 --> 02:00:30.36 It was called Mako Wow steak house.
02:00:30.36 --> 02:00:32.12 And I owned it myself.
02:00:32.12 --> 02:00:33.72 Mako Wow up country.
02:00:33.72 --> 02:00:35.56 Also known as up country.

02:02:55.72 --> 02:03:01.12 Well, right on, like I said, I actually heard about you
02:03:01.12 --> 02:03:03.92 through this young generation of the generation,
02:03:03.92 --> 02:03:05.24 I guess the generation behind me,
02:03:05.24 --> 02:03:07.44 I want to make myself sound older, make them sound young.
02:03:07.44 --> 02:03:11.88 They're all grown men that are deep into the teams now,
02:03:11.88 --> 02:03:14.20 but those were the guys that kind of told me about
02:03:14.20 --> 02:03:15.56 what you passed onto them.
02:03:15.56 --> 02:03:18.000 So it's awesome to have you on here.
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.20 And thanks for sharing some of those lessons learned
02:03:20.20 --> 02:03:22.52 and thanks for your service.
02:03:22.52 --> 02:03:25.40 And thanks for the service and sacrifice
02:03:25.40 --> 02:03:27.20 of your brother as well.
02:03:28.48 --> 02:03:31.84 We owe everything to you guys that put in the work
02:03:31.84 --> 02:03:35.64 in the early days and created the tradition
02:03:35.64 --> 02:03:37.64 that we all try and uphold.

02:03:39.52 --> 02:03:42.08 Thanks for everything you and your family have done.
02:03:42.08 --> 02:03:42.92 Thank you.
02:03:42.92 --> 02:03:47.92 And with that, Lance Man has left the building.
02:03:49.92 --> 02:03:52.92 Uh, pretty awesome.
02:03:52.92 --> 02:03:53.44 Got it.
02:03:53.44 --> 02:03:55.16 Hang out with for a couple hours.
02:03:55.16 --> 02:03:56.000 Yeah.
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.84 And by the way, just note, multiple times, multiple times,
02:04:01.84 --> 02:04:03.48 he kind of referred to himself as like,
02:04:03.48 --> 02:04:05.48 decrepit and all this stuff.
02:04:05.48 --> 02:04:08.64 This dude's 80, three years old, 82 years old,
02:04:08.64 --> 02:04:09.64 almost say three years old.
02:04:09.64 --> 02:04:11.28 He is not decrepit.
02:04:11.28 --> 02:04:15.08 No. And he is in great shape.
02:04:15.08 --> 02:04:17.16 And I'm sure maybe he's not in this good shape
02:04:17.16 --> 02:04:19.36 as he was when he was 22 years old,
02:04:19.36 --> 02:04:21.44 going through UDT training.
02:04:21.44 --> 02:04:23.76 But what an awesome guy.
02:04:23.76 --> 02:04:25.96 And you know, live in it.
02:04:25.96 --> 02:04:26.96 Yeah.
02:04:26.96 --> 02:04:28.04 Yeah, you know how you can tell.
02:04:28.04 --> 02:04:30.96 Like even young people, younger people, whatever.
02:04:30.96 --> 02:04:32.48 Kind of just when they walk up to you
02:04:32.48 --> 02:04:34.72 and you know how they kind of talk and pull themselves
02:04:34.72 --> 02:04:35.60 and walk from here to there.
02:04:35.60 --> 02:04:36.44 You can kind of tell.
02:04:36.44 --> 02:04:39.16 You know, you have a small little gauge of, oh.
02:04:39.16 --> 02:04:40.20 And yeah, when he rolls up,
02:04:40.20 --> 02:04:43.20 it's kind of like, it's pretty impressive for 82.
02:04:43.20 --> 02:04:44.44 Just tell you just rolling up.
02:04:44.44 --> 02:04:47.16 Yeah, well, actually you just don't even think he's 82.
02:04:47.16 --> 02:04:48.000 Yeah.
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.20 You just, you think maybe he looks old for,
02:04:51.20 --> 02:04:54.000 you know, that's kind of looks pretty old for a 51 year old.
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:54.36 Yeah.
02:04:54.36 --> 02:04:55.20 You know what I'm saying?
02:04:55.20 --> 02:04:55.72 Yeah, yeah.
02:04:55.72 --> 02:05:00.28 That's kind of the impression you get from the way he's
02:05:00.28 --> 02:05:00.80 carrying himself.
02:05:00.80 --> 02:05:04.08 So definitely a, a definitely a stud.
02:05:04.08 --> 02:05:05.40 And pretty cool.
02:05:05.40 --> 02:05:07.96 The fact that he's had this influence on like this younger
02:05:07.96 --> 02:05:09.84 generation at, hey, I like it again.
02:05:09.84 --> 02:05:13.76 I'm, I, I feel like I sound like I'm being condescending
02:05:13.76 --> 02:05:18.000 when I call the guys kind of, whatever behind me,
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.60 not right behind me, but you know, like 10 years, 15 years
02:05:21.60 --> 02:05:23.60 behind me and the teams, that's sort of the next generation.
02:05:23.60 --> 02:05:26.36 I don't even know if that means next generation.
02:05:26.36 --> 02:05:29.56 But this guy was a real mentor and inspiration
02:05:29.56 --> 02:05:30.52 to a bunch of those guys.
02:05:30.52 --> 02:05:32.96 So that's kind of how I heard about him
02:05:32.96 --> 02:05:35.20 and pretty cool to have him on here
02:05:35.20 --> 02:05:37.64 and talk through some of this stuff.
02:05:37.64 --> 02:05:40.84 And definitely a, you know, there's a couple things
02:05:40.84 --> 02:05:41.44 I heard about him.
02:05:41.44 --> 02:05:42.36 I was like, one thing I heard about him.
02:05:42.36 --> 02:05:43.60 And we didn't bring this up again.
02:05:43.60 --> 02:05:45.80 You know, I look back and was like, I'm like,
02:05:45.80 --> 02:05:48.28 apparently he just never wears a wet suit when surfing
02:05:48.28 --> 02:05:51.28 and stuff, which is, you know, this dude is,
02:05:51.28 --> 02:05:53.24 you know, with all like cold, cold immersion, you know,
02:05:53.24 --> 02:05:55.04 I have an ice bath, you know, taking a,
02:05:55.04 --> 02:05:58.84 he's just going surfing at two hours with no wet suit,
02:05:58.84 --> 02:06:00.80 which by the way, is cold in Southern California.
02:06:00.80 --> 02:06:01.64 It's cold.
02:06:01.64 --> 02:06:02.60 That's not warm.
02:06:02.60 --> 02:06:04.24 Hawaii's is warm.
02:06:04.24 --> 02:06:06.04 You know, really need a wet suit.
02:06:06.04 --> 02:06:08.44 Did you ever wear a wet suit when you're sponging in Hawaii?
02:06:08.44 --> 02:06:09.28 No, never.
02:06:09.28 --> 02:06:12.80 So you don't really need a wet suit in Hawaii.
02:06:12.80 --> 02:06:14.44 Correction, you don't need a wet suit.
02:06:14.44 --> 02:06:16.44 You don't need a wet suit in Hawaii.
02:06:16.44 --> 02:06:18.16 Especially when you compare to here.
02:06:18.16 --> 02:06:19.000 Oh, yeah.
02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.60 Even the coldest of in Hawaii, it's kind of like,
02:06:20.60 --> 02:06:23.24 okay, I'll get out after three hours.
02:06:23.24 --> 02:06:24.64 Usually it's like eight night hours.
02:06:24.64 --> 02:06:25.64 You can be in the water.
02:06:25.64 --> 02:06:26.64 Yeah.
02:06:26.64 --> 02:06:28.80 That is so luxury isn't it.
02:06:28.80 --> 02:06:31.12 Hawaii's kind of a little bit of paradise isn't it?
02:06:31.12 --> 02:06:31.96 No way.
02:06:31.96 --> 02:06:34.44 Can you imagine he moved from Baltimore to Hawaii?
02:06:34.44 --> 02:06:35.28 Yeah, very different.
02:06:35.28 --> 02:06:38.88 That's a game changer.
02:06:38.88 --> 02:06:44.92 So awesome to have him in on here is obviously he was
02:06:44.92 --> 02:06:46.64 difficult for him to talk about his brother,
02:06:46.64 --> 02:06:49.96 even after all these years, brother kind of followed his
02:06:49.96 --> 02:06:53.52 footsteps and ended up being killed in Vietnam.
02:06:53.52 --> 02:06:55.96 And I read a little bit about that.
02:06:55.96 --> 02:07:00.96 He, they were basically in a gunfight on a ship,
02:07:00.96 --> 02:07:04.56 in a gunfight on a ship,
02:07:04.56 --> 02:07:06.40 on a small boat.
02:07:06.40 --> 02:07:11.76 And they took some either mortars or rocket fire
02:07:11.76 --> 02:07:15.36 and ended up killing two seals.
02:07:16.76 --> 02:07:18.000 We attended J.G.
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.12 Dan Man who we talked about,
02:07:19.12 --> 02:07:22.88 but also another seal named last name of Boston
02:07:22.88 --> 02:07:27.88 and then another one named Neal who died of wounds later.
02:07:27.88 --> 02:07:32.80 And that's another thing that you get to hear
02:07:32.80 --> 02:07:36.56 this incredible life and these adventures
02:07:36.56 --> 02:07:38.68 that Lance Man has been on.
02:07:38.68 --> 02:07:43.96 And you know, we know, I know he knows
02:07:43.96 --> 02:07:46.84 that his brother didn't get those opportunities.
02:07:46.84 --> 02:07:51.84 And that's something that we all need to think about.
02:07:51.84 --> 02:07:54.48 You know, all the guys that didn't come home
02:07:54.48 --> 02:07:57.84 and the fact that we get this opportunity to go
02:07:57.84 --> 02:08:02.04 and surf without a wet suit and go and become a lifeguard at 55 years old.
02:08:02.04 --> 02:08:04.32 And go and open up restaurants and move around the world.
02:08:04.32 --> 02:08:07.16 And like all those things are opportunities
02:08:07.16 --> 02:08:13.16 that we have because of people that made this sacrifice for us.
02:08:13.16 --> 02:08:17.76 So definitely something to think about.
02:08:21.44 --> 02:08:24.80 With that, thanks for listening to the podcast.
02:08:24.80 --> 02:08:25.92 Thanks for supporting.
02:08:25.92 --> 02:08:30.32 You know, we did feed Lance Man some he had some go.
02:08:30.32 --> 02:08:32.16 He's fired up to by two.
02:08:32.16 --> 02:08:33.96 He was a little surprised when he tasted it.
02:08:33.96 --> 02:08:34.84 It's like all this is good.
02:08:34.84 --> 02:08:35.84 Yeah.
02:08:35.84 --> 02:08:37.64 So if you notice he didn't touch his water.
02:08:37.64 --> 02:08:38.92 No, he went all the way.
02:08:38.92 --> 02:08:39.92 He chose the go.
02:08:39.92 --> 02:08:40.92 He will all go.
02:08:40.92 --> 02:08:41.92 He chose go.
02:08:41.92 --> 02:08:42.92 Yeah.
02:08:42.92 --> 02:08:46.16 He that's we're you ever, or I'm sitting here listening
02:08:46.16 --> 02:08:47.08 to the whole deal.
02:08:47.08 --> 02:08:49.92 And then you know how, I don't know, it's like this weird map.
02:08:49.92 --> 02:08:51.80 Maybe a alone on this, maybe I'm not.
02:08:51.80 --> 02:08:53.64 But it's this weird map where it's like you kind of think,
02:08:53.64 --> 02:08:56.84 oh yeah, when you're like in high school or whatever, it's like that's a
02:08:56.84 --> 02:08:59.24 certain period of your life and it's like, you're whole life ahead of you.
02:08:59.24 --> 02:09:00.24 Then you get your 20s.
02:09:00.24 --> 02:09:01.24 Okay.
02:09:01.24 --> 02:09:04.000 And then you 30s you kind of hit your groove 40s.
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.16 And then once you hit like 50 ish, you kind of are like, okay,
02:09:07.16 --> 02:09:10.80 you're kind of like, like, retires and the destiny is already known.
02:09:10.80 --> 02:09:12.000 Yeah, exactly.
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.80 And you're kind of in retirement mode a little bit.
02:09:13.80 --> 02:09:15.24 You take your foot off the gas.
02:09:15.24 --> 02:09:17.64 You know, and then 60 is kind of like your straight up retired.
02:09:17.64 --> 02:09:19.04 You're losing.
02:09:19.04 --> 02:09:20.04 That's kind of the map.
02:09:20.04 --> 02:09:22.36 You kind of have maybe subconsciously.
02:09:22.36 --> 02:09:25.32 And bro, he's like talking about like, oh yeah, let me be a lifeguard
02:09:25.32 --> 02:09:26.92 and making it past the test of my brow.
02:09:26.92 --> 02:09:30.64 You're not realizing the map that we're all thinking about you.
02:09:30.64 --> 02:09:31.72 And then you think about it.
02:09:31.72 --> 02:09:34.52 Oh, wait, he just had a different kind of attitude where he was like,
02:09:34.52 --> 02:09:37.08 oh, no, we're still going right now.
02:09:37.08 --> 02:09:39.24 Like it's not over like we're still going, whatever.
02:09:39.24 --> 02:09:40.24 Then you kind of consider it.
02:09:40.24 --> 02:09:41.72 Oh, wait, you can do that.
02:09:41.72 --> 02:09:42.88 Yeah.
02:09:42.88 --> 02:09:46.40 And if you do, it's kind of, I mean, this is just kind of deduction really.
02:09:46.40 --> 02:09:49.88 But thinking mad, if you have that attitude, it's kind of like you can live
02:09:49.88 --> 02:09:51.92 like a whole another life in a way.
02:09:51.92 --> 02:09:54.64 Where he's like 82, Brett, let's face it.
02:09:54.64 --> 02:09:59.48 If I even live to 82, am I going to be like, what the hell?
02:09:59.48 --> 02:10:03.96 You know, it feels like I've been done for like 20 years already.
02:10:03.96 --> 02:10:08.40 But he's just like mad that he's even smelling the darkness, even though he's not.
02:10:08.40 --> 02:10:09.52 I know what the coffee thing.
02:10:09.52 --> 02:10:10.000 Yeah.
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.40 Well, it's, you know, you said, you said it's not over.
02:10:13.40 --> 02:10:14.40 Right?
02:10:14.40 --> 02:10:19.56 You ever seen like the kid in the wrestling tournament or the kid in the basketball
02:10:19.56 --> 02:10:22.32 game or whatever and like they're kind of losing.
02:10:22.32 --> 02:10:23.92 But there's one kid that he's not done yet.
02:10:23.92 --> 02:10:24.92 It's not over yet.
02:10:24.92 --> 02:10:25.92 Right.
02:10:25.92 --> 02:10:26.92 And he's mine.
02:10:26.92 --> 02:10:27.92 It's not over.
02:10:27.92 --> 02:10:28.92 We're not done with this game.
02:10:28.92 --> 02:10:33.72 And sometimes that kid can turn sparked and come back and make things happen and get the
02:10:33.72 --> 02:10:35.72 victory.
02:10:35.72 --> 02:10:36.72 Yeah.
02:10:36.72 --> 02:10:37.92 It's pretty wild.
02:10:37.92 --> 02:10:46.000 And so that attitude of its, you know, when my daughter was wrestling, uh, when she was
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.24 in trying to make it through the state and in order to make it through the state, you
02:10:50.24 --> 02:10:53.92 got to win first, second or third.
02:10:53.92 --> 02:10:57.68 And her first day, she lost a match.
02:10:57.68 --> 02:10:58.68 She won a cup.
02:10:58.68 --> 02:11:01.60 She won a few, she won quite a few matches, but she lost a match, which means the next
02:11:01.60 --> 02:11:07.32 day, she was going to have to win every single match, which is hard to do.
02:11:07.32 --> 02:11:08.72 This is, this is now high level.
02:11:08.72 --> 02:11:09.72 This isn't playing around.
02:11:09.72 --> 02:11:13.84 We're trying to get to state championships in California, which is a big deal.
02:11:13.84 --> 02:11:18.32 And we're actually out in a place in the Imperial Valley of California called
02:11:18.32 --> 02:11:19.32 Brawley.
02:11:19.32 --> 02:11:23.76 And Brawley is a great athletic school.
02:11:23.76 --> 02:11:27.20 And they have, because it's out in the middle of the desert, these are tough, hard
02:11:27.20 --> 02:11:28.20 working kids.
02:11:28.20 --> 02:11:31.60 Their athletic programs are super hard core because they have nothing else to do.
02:11:31.60 --> 02:11:33.08 They live in Brawley, right?
02:11:33.08 --> 02:11:35.48 You know, I got, I got a friend that's from Brawley's in the teams.
02:11:35.48 --> 02:11:39.20 And, you know, he's like, you're in Brawley, bro, that's what you're going to do.
02:11:39.20 --> 02:11:40.20 You're just like, that's what you're going to do.
02:11:40.20 --> 02:11:41.20 You're going to fight.
02:11:41.20 --> 02:11:42.20 You're going to wrestle.
02:11:42.20 --> 02:11:43.20 You don't play football.
02:11:43.20 --> 02:11:49.64 So, my daughter, she knows that, you know, that night, she's thinking, if she loses
02:11:49.64 --> 02:11:50.64 one match, she's not going to state.
02:11:50.64 --> 02:11:54.72 There's her senior year, right?
02:11:54.72 --> 02:11:57.36 That night, and she was underweight.
02:11:57.36 --> 02:12:00.80 So she wasn't even close to like the high end of her weight.
02:12:00.80 --> 02:12:04.72 Brawley, she probably, she could have cut weight a few pounds and gone one way, scrapped
02:12:04.72 --> 02:12:07.20 down, but she didn't do that.
02:12:07.20 --> 02:12:12.60 So anyways, we like, she loses, she doesn't even talk to me on the way back to the hotel.
02:12:12.60 --> 02:12:14.84 She just angry.
02:12:14.84 --> 02:12:15.84 And not even not.
02:12:15.84 --> 02:12:16.84 She wasn't really angry.
02:12:16.84 --> 02:12:18.52 She was kind of like a little bit sad, you know?
02:12:18.52 --> 02:12:21.16 She said, wasn't talking to me, wasn't talking to anybody.
02:12:21.16 --> 02:12:22.16 We get back there.
02:12:22.16 --> 02:12:24.08 I said, you want somebody, and she says, yeah, that's what he wants.
02:12:24.08 --> 02:12:25.32 She's like, pizza hut.
02:12:25.32 --> 02:12:29.28 So we order a bunch of pizza hut, whatever.
02:12:29.28 --> 02:12:35.40 And, you know, she still underweight, but she goes out the next day.
02:12:35.40 --> 02:12:38.56 And like, I saw a little look in her face.
02:12:38.56 --> 02:12:40.52 That was like, it's not old.
02:12:40.52 --> 02:12:42.36 This is an older.
02:12:42.36 --> 02:12:45.44 And she won her first match.
02:12:45.44 --> 02:12:50.64 And you could see almost like a sort of vibe coming over.
02:12:50.64 --> 02:12:52.08 And then she won her next match.
02:12:52.08 --> 02:12:53.08 And she won her next match.
02:12:53.08 --> 02:12:57.04 And then it wasn't her last match of the day, but her toughest match of the day, where
02:12:57.04 --> 02:13:01.16 in Brawley and she's wrestling against a girl from Brawley.
02:13:01.16 --> 02:13:06.84 And these croiss scrap respect to Brawley.
02:13:06.84 --> 02:13:09.32 And they had a brawl.
02:13:09.32 --> 02:13:10.32 Then my daughter won.
02:13:10.32 --> 02:13:12.76 And, and, but you know, it's that attitude.
02:13:12.76 --> 02:13:17.96 And then she ended up going to states, but that attitude of it's not over yet.
02:13:17.96 --> 02:13:19.84 But it's not over.
02:13:19.84 --> 02:13:25.12 And to have that attitude with life, that's a little less in learned for everybody today.
02:13:25.12 --> 02:13:27.56 A little less in learned for everybody.
02:13:27.56 --> 02:13:28.56 It's not over.
02:13:28.56 --> 02:13:29.56 But I felt it.
02:13:29.56 --> 02:13:32.88 I felt like he was kind of going harder at 82 than I am right now.
02:13:32.88 --> 02:13:34.84 I kind of had that feeling.
02:13:34.84 --> 02:13:38.000 You know, I'd say that's an accurate statement.
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.52 Awesome.
02:13:40.52 --> 02:13:41.52 All right.

02:14:00.88 --> 02:14:02.68 Look, we can't afford to go to chart house every night.
02:14:02.68 --> 02:14:03.68 Too long to get.
02:14:03.68 --> 02:14:04.68 Right.
02:14:04.68 --> 02:14:07.24 Now, maybe when you're at E5 team guy like how's it?
02:14:07.24 --> 02:14:08.72 Four team guy going to chart house.
02:14:08.72 --> 02:14:10.12 We're going to get that prime rib.
02:14:10.12 --> 02:14:11.12 So what is chart house?
02:14:11.12 --> 02:14:12.12 It's a restaurant.
02:14:12.12 --> 02:14:13.12 It's a nice restaurant.
02:14:13.12 --> 02:14:14.12 Oh, restaurant.
02:14:14.12 --> 02:14:15.12 Is it like a couple?
02:14:15.12 --> 02:14:16.12 You didn't even know it was a restaurant.
02:14:16.12 --> 02:14:17.48 It's a straight up restaurant.
02:14:17.48 --> 02:14:20.48 And there was one in Coronado that was all, it's a different restaurant now.
02:14:20.48 --> 02:14:23.08 But it was on, it was, it was like a boat house.
02:14:23.08 --> 02:14:24.08 It was on the water.
02:14:24.08 --> 02:14:26.84 It was like a dock basically, real nice.
02:14:26.84 --> 02:14:29.76 And it was one of those things too when you're young.
02:14:29.76 --> 02:14:34.40 Like a young person is like a 20, 20 year old kid in supposed to be going to the chart
02:14:34.40 --> 02:14:36.44 out because you don't have enough money for it unless you have a day.
02:14:36.44 --> 02:14:37.44 So you're young team guy.
02:14:37.44 --> 02:14:42.000 Did you like up there order in that $22 prime rib back in 91?
02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000 You're like your kind of a boss.
02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000 Right?
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.64 Kind of a boss like hey, normal in the chart house?
02:14:47.64 --> 02:14:49.40 You're like a business person, right?
02:14:49.40 --> 02:14:53.24 There's people in there with like shirts, like real like whatever.
02:14:53.24 --> 02:14:54.88 Nice shirts and stuff.
02:14:54.88 --> 02:14:55.88 You know?
02:14:55.88 --> 02:14:57.32 So wait, this is the chart house.
02:14:57.32 --> 02:14:58.88 What's the dynamic when you go in there?
02:14:58.88 --> 02:14:59.88 Is it like a military?
02:14:59.88 --> 02:15:00.88 No, no, no, no.
02:15:00.88 --> 02:15:01.88 It's just more higher in.
02:15:01.88 --> 02:15:02.88 No, it's not.
02:15:02.88 --> 02:15:05.24 Well, it was created by team guys, right?
02:15:05.24 --> 02:15:11.80 So it's kind of chill like the waiters and waitresses would be wearing like Hawaiian shirts.
02:15:11.80 --> 02:15:15.72 But they're also charging you know like $29 for a piece of meat, right?
02:15:15.72 --> 02:15:17.40 So it's well, and that's back then.
02:15:17.40 --> 02:15:25.12 So like today a BD equivalent of like probably 40 bucks, you know, 50 bucks per main course.
02:15:25.12 --> 02:15:26.88 Yeah, yeah, so yeah, you're right.
02:15:26.88 --> 02:15:31.16 So like if you're, if you don't have some money, yeah, whatever, that's going to be a
02:15:31.16 --> 02:15:32.16 not just casual one.
02:15:32.16 --> 02:15:36.76 Yeah, unless you're a young guy in the teams, you have no expenses other than just
02:15:36.76 --> 02:15:39.32 what you're going to eat, you get after it.
02:15:39.32 --> 02:15:43.08 Did you guys like know that it was kind of like has the team get?
02:15:43.08 --> 02:15:48.12 I knew I knew I had team at roots, but no one, you know, I was like, well, maybe someone
02:15:48.12 --> 02:15:50.60 is going to be like, hey, you guys are all like, are you guys not sure what he was
02:15:50.60 --> 02:15:52.08 known and ever said that to me?
02:15:52.08 --> 02:15:54.48 You know, they just kind of, which is pretty obvious, we're in this freaking
02:15:54.48 --> 02:15:58.80 sales team's going corn, we're like literally 500 meters from base.
02:15:58.80 --> 02:16:00.000 Yeah, yeah.
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.72 But I think maybe what's funny is I thought that the chart house, I thought that I
02:16:04.72 --> 02:16:06.56 was at like the first chart house in 1999.
02:16:06.56 --> 02:16:08.16 He's like, no, it started in 1964.
02:16:08.16 --> 02:16:10.92 So I was way off based on that one.
02:16:10.92 --> 02:16:14.88 Oh yeah, yeah, it's interesting to he and he didn't go as deep into it.
02:16:14.88 --> 02:16:21.52 It's a comma, I didn't experience it in Hawaii, but all those places is weird because I
02:16:21.52 --> 02:16:25.32 kind of think where he all the places he was talking about, like I know those places
02:16:25.32 --> 02:16:26.92 whatever, but this is back in the day.
02:16:26.92 --> 02:16:30.88 So it's like different, you know, so it can as it contrast to whatever, when he was like
02:16:30.88 --> 02:16:35.12 Outrigger, you know, the Outrigger, but now Outrigger is everywhere.
02:16:35.12 --> 02:16:37.94 But the main one, that's the one he was talking about, yeah, you talk about that main
02:16:37.94 --> 02:16:39.88 one that you stay at by dukes.
02:16:39.88 --> 02:16:41.44 Yeah, I've been to that one.
02:16:41.44 --> 02:16:43.28 Oh yeah, it's kind of a hype scenario.
02:16:43.28 --> 02:16:46.64 They got a bar like on the beach situation.
02:16:46.64 --> 02:16:47.64 You know what I was saying?
02:16:47.64 --> 02:16:50.44 That's where I proposed to my current wife, finally.
02:16:50.44 --> 02:16:51.44 You know what?
02:16:51.44 --> 02:16:56.88 We had a weird scenario with my wife, the way things kind of finally got solidified.
02:16:56.88 --> 02:17:01.40 But when I finally got her a ring, let's say, yeah, yeah.
02:17:01.40 --> 02:17:04.52 When I finally got her a ring, I asked her to come out for dinner.
02:17:04.52 --> 02:17:08.60 We went out for dinner, guess where we went to dinner, to our house, not even the
02:17:08.60 --> 02:17:10.16 wedding coronado.
02:17:10.16 --> 02:17:14.28 We went to the one that was down by the peer or whatever in San Diego.
02:17:14.28 --> 02:17:16.52 So it was sort of an extra level of hype.
02:17:16.52 --> 02:17:18.32 It wasn't just going to coronado.
02:17:18.32 --> 02:17:21.44 Yeah, I'm going to take you extra level of hype and I had that little.
02:17:21.44 --> 02:17:25.84 So I told her to get dressed up and whatever, like, you know, I put on like a shirt, you
02:17:25.84 --> 02:17:29.52 know, because back in the day, it was hard to get her shirt on.
02:17:29.52 --> 02:17:34.76 And the t-shirt was kind of hard, but like putting on a collar shirt was sort of a big deal.
02:17:34.76 --> 02:17:36.76 So she knew something was up some formal.
02:17:36.76 --> 02:17:37.76 Yeah.
02:17:37.76 --> 02:17:39.56 Yep, get yourself a jugglefuel.
02:17:39.56 --> 02:17:43.96 Jugglefuel.com, get some, get some of the drinks from walla, get some of any of it from
02:17:43.96 --> 02:17:47.36 the vitamin shop that's going to help you out.
02:17:47.36 --> 02:17:48.96 Get yourself some clothes.
02:17:48.96 --> 02:17:52.96 Get yourself some American made clothes straight up, straight up.
02:17:52.96 --> 02:17:57.68 You're like a new factory gene or something where I might just seen like factory gene is
02:17:57.68 --> 02:18:00.56 the same gene we've always had that's called the factory two types of genes.
02:18:00.56 --> 02:18:08.04 Factory gene, Delta 68, Delta 68 is lighter, little thinner, factory heavy.
02:18:08.04 --> 02:18:14.72 So if you're in Michigan or you're in Maine and it's going to be winter time, get yourself
02:18:14.72 --> 02:18:16.28 the set of factory bands.
02:18:16.28 --> 02:18:22.80 If you're in so cow or you're deploying to Vietnam, get yourself a very Delta 68.
02:18:22.80 --> 02:18:26.84 And all of it is made in America, all of it's made in America.
02:18:26.84 --> 02:18:30.24 And look, that's the way everything should be made.
02:18:30.24 --> 02:18:34.44 If you're in America and you should be buying something that's made in America, why would
02:18:34.44 --> 02:18:35.84 you not do that?
02:18:35.84 --> 02:18:40.72 I'll tell you why, because you think, well, you know, I want to save $14.
02:18:40.72 --> 02:18:46.12 But when you save that $14, you're actually costing yourself infinitely more on the
02:18:46.12 --> 02:18:49.60 backside when your country is crumbling.
02:18:49.60 --> 02:18:54.56 And when you feel in your soul that you're enslaving human beings overseas, at the very least
02:18:54.56 --> 02:18:55.56 keep it on.
02:18:55.56 --> 02:18:59.04 At the very least keeping people enslaved overseas.
02:18:59.04 --> 02:19:00.04 It's not what that happened.
02:19:00.04 --> 02:19:01.04 Go to origin.
02:19:01.04 --> 02:19:05.000 USA.com, get yourself some boots, get yourself a G.
02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000 Get yourself a G. A comfy G.
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.84 No one even thought that G's were going to be comfortable.
02:19:08.84 --> 02:19:09.84 No, that wasn't.
02:19:09.84 --> 02:19:10.84 It was sort of you.
02:19:10.84 --> 02:19:12.68 You just had to accept that G's were uncomfortable.
02:19:12.68 --> 02:19:13.68 Yes.
02:19:13.68 --> 02:19:14.68 That G's.
02:19:14.68 --> 02:19:15.68 Let's face it.
02:19:15.68 --> 02:19:16.68 You're going to put a G on.
02:19:16.68 --> 02:19:17.68 You're not happy.
02:19:17.68 --> 02:19:18.68 I felt that way.
02:19:18.68 --> 02:19:19.76 I'm not happy putting on a G.
02:19:19.76 --> 02:19:20.76 Until now.
02:19:20.76 --> 02:19:23.76 Now you put on a G. You kind of smile a little bit.
02:19:23.76 --> 02:19:24.76 Right?
02:19:24.76 --> 02:19:27.40 You're kind of smile a little bit when you put on an origin G.
02:19:27.40 --> 02:19:29.96 You kind of feel like, yeah, well, that felt, yeah.
02:19:29.96 --> 02:19:31.40 A little smile.
02:19:31.40 --> 02:19:33.48 You didn't think it was possible.
02:19:33.48 --> 02:19:35.000 You didn't think it was possible.
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000 It's more than possible.
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000 It's a reality.
02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.000 It's happening.

02:19:48.64 --> 02:19:49.48 It's a big deal.
02:19:49.48 --> 02:19:51.16 Discipline equals freedom.
02:19:51.16 --> 02:19:52.16 That goes deep.
02:19:52.16 --> 02:19:55.76 I know you didn't know that when you made it up or whatever, but it goes deep.
02:19:55.76 --> 02:19:56.76 And please.
02:19:56.76 --> 02:19:58.96 You know, shirt locker.
02:19:58.96 --> 02:20:00.60 Even life, babin.
02:20:00.60 --> 02:20:04.56 You know, just did not support the everyone, muskett stone, T-shirt.
02:20:04.56 --> 02:20:05.56 Yes.
02:20:05.56 --> 02:20:08.08 So that one is a very controversial, but it's not for everybody.
02:20:08.08 --> 02:20:12.48 I did not know that it was going to go, I, to me, this is, this is, this is why
02:20:12.48 --> 02:20:13.80 I know, this is why I don't trust myself.
02:20:13.80 --> 02:20:14.80 This is why I always question myself.
02:20:14.80 --> 02:20:16.84 This is why I was thinking, oh, you know, I might not have the best idea.
02:20:16.84 --> 02:20:19.76 So for those of you don't know, we made a T-shirt.
02:20:19.76 --> 02:20:22.04 It's based on it's for the shirt locker.
02:20:22.04 --> 02:20:25.48 It's sort of a subscription thing and you get a T-shirt every month.
02:20:25.48 --> 02:20:28.60 And there, we can be a little bit more.
02:20:28.60 --> 02:20:31.24 Let's say, creative with the designs.
02:20:31.24 --> 02:20:32.44 We can take a little bit more risk.
02:20:32.44 --> 02:20:33.96 We can get a little bit wild.
02:20:33.96 --> 02:20:34.72 So this is an idea.
02:20:34.72 --> 02:20:35.72 I had forever.
02:20:35.72 --> 02:20:37.56 I thought this was like the best selling T-shirt all the time.
02:20:37.56 --> 02:20:38.92 It's been everyone's going to want this one.
02:20:38.92 --> 02:20:40.24 Like we have to back order it.
02:20:40.24 --> 02:20:41.56 Like a bunch of crazy stuff's going to happen.
02:20:41.56 --> 02:20:47.36 We're going to see him on, you know, the cover of fashion magazines throughout the world.
02:20:47.36 --> 02:20:51.32 So there's a story about Vietnam guy has a stoner.
02:20:51.32 --> 02:20:55.36 We used a weapon called the stoner, the stoner 63 in Vietnam.
02:20:55.36 --> 02:20:57.96 Seals used to that we were famous for using it.
02:20:57.96 --> 02:21:03.000 And a guy I knew got, went and picked up his weapon from the armory.
02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:08.20 And someone else that had taken the weapon to Vietnam on an alternate tour had carved
02:21:08.20 --> 02:21:12.52 into the buttstock everybody must get stoned.
02:21:12.52 --> 02:21:14.12 And I thought that was so cool.
02:21:14.12 --> 02:21:15.92 You know, it's the 60s.
02:21:15.92 --> 02:21:18.28 That's a song by Bob Dylan.
02:21:18.28 --> 02:21:20.72 I think everybody must get stoned.
02:21:20.72 --> 02:21:24.88 So I thought, hey, of course, we'll make a t-shirt.
02:21:24.88 --> 02:21:27.88 And people just didn't get it, man.
02:21:27.88 --> 02:21:31.72 And it's not even just some people don't like it because there's a machine gun on it.
02:21:31.72 --> 02:21:33.96 Some people don't like it because it says get stoned on it.
02:21:33.96 --> 02:21:35.44 You put those two things together.
02:21:35.44 --> 02:21:39.52 The only people that are going to like it is me and like one other person I guess.
02:21:39.52 --> 02:21:40.52 Yeah, me.
02:21:40.52 --> 02:21:41.52 Yeah.
02:21:41.52 --> 02:21:45.16 So anyways, you're going to roll the dice a little bit, I guess.
02:21:45.16 --> 02:21:48.40 Apparently we never ran into that, but hey man.
02:21:48.40 --> 02:21:51.60 That's the only one that's kind of gotten the neck, the negative feedback.
02:21:51.60 --> 02:21:53.24 No, no, no.
02:21:53.24 --> 02:21:57.20 There's always going to be your odd guy, like, you know, or person, whatever.
02:21:57.20 --> 02:21:59.44 It's like not liking something.
02:21:59.44 --> 02:22:01.92 So hey, man, I think it's not for everybody.
02:22:01.92 --> 02:22:02.92 We knew that going in.
02:22:02.92 --> 02:22:07.36 But yeah, sometimes I guess, apparently, sometimes these shirts go hard.
02:22:07.36 --> 02:22:08.36 Yeah.
02:22:08.36 --> 02:22:16.36 So if you feel in edgy, if you want to support kind of just like give the support and you
02:22:16.36 --> 02:22:19.56 also want to take risks, because you're a risk taker, you're kind of person that says,
02:22:19.56 --> 02:22:21.28 you know what, I'm in the game.
02:22:21.28 --> 02:22:23.96 You know what, you're saying yourself, it's not over.

02:23:05.44 --> 02:23:09.92 I guess that might be bad planning or whatever, but that section about the UDTs and the
02:23:09.92 --> 02:23:12.80 cycle of just had to kind of go with it again.
02:23:12.80 --> 02:23:17.08 But that book is a Ben Milligan by water beneath the walls.
