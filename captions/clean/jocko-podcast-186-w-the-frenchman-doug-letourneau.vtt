00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.08
This is Jacob podcast number one 86 with me, Jocca Willink.

2
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:14.28
Among the newly minted special forces soldiers were Douglas L. L. L. L.

3
00:00:14.28 --> 00:00:21.48
L. L. L. S. Skinny, 135 pound California Cowboy, John Shore, a blonde haired, slightly

4
00:00:21.48 --> 00:00:28.80
overweight baby faced kid from Georgia and Frank McClowski, a tough combat hardened veteran

5
00:00:28.80 --> 00:00:34.48
of the 101st Airborne Division. McClowski arrived sporting seat-pitch from a wound in the

6
00:00:34.48 --> 00:00:40.52
back of his head. This trio of green braids had completed their special forces in country training

7
00:00:40.52 --> 00:00:45.56
program in Not Train, the fifth special forces group headquarters. When a sergeant

8
00:00:45.56 --> 00:00:51.72
not train asked for special forces soldiers to volunteer for a secret project, they raised

9
00:00:51.72 --> 00:00:58.76
their hands. In short order, they were flown to FOB 4 in the northern sector of

10
00:00:58.76 --> 00:01:06.18
South Vietnam, I. Core. Upon reporting in, they were told that Camp Commander Colonel Jack

11
00:01:06.18 --> 00:01:13.82
Warren would brief them in the morning on the CNC mission in Southeast Asia. Finally,

12
00:01:13.82 --> 00:01:20.62
after more than a year of training for attorney, the game was on. How much better could

13
00:01:20.62 --> 00:01:25.76
this get? It seems all his life he'd been preparing for this moment. From riding,

14
00:01:25.76 --> 00:01:31.20
Brody O'Bronks and breaking nearly every bone in his body to wrangling animals for television shows

15
00:01:31.20 --> 00:01:36.000
like Dactari and Cowboy in Africa starring Chuck Connors.

16
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.72
Let's turn on a little bit about taking a calculated risk.

17
00:01:41.72 --> 00:01:47.16
And after he had gotten his hands on Robin Moore's book of the Green Berets, he knew this

18
00:01:47.16 --> 00:01:48.40
was for him.

19
00:01:48.40 --> 00:01:50.84
Gorilla Warfare, Czech.

20
00:01:50.84 --> 00:01:52.80
Counter-insurgency training, Czech.

21
00:01:52.80 --> 00:01:55.44
Unconventional warfare, Czech.

22
00:01:55.44 --> 00:02:00.68
The Chernobyl couldn't wait to write his own story that he could someday share with his dad,

23
00:02:00.68 --> 00:02:07.52
a World War II B-17 pilot and former POW.

24
00:02:07.52 --> 00:02:11.24
Nothing however could have prepared him for the sight that greeted him as he entered

25
00:02:11.24 --> 00:02:13.52
the transient barracks.

26
00:02:13.52 --> 00:02:18.72
There, etched onto the concrete floor and forever in his memory was the charred outline

27
00:02:18.72 --> 00:02:26.000
of a man's body, a grizzly reminder of the 23 August 1968 attack on FOB IV.

28
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.84
That faithful evening, North Vietnamese sappers in Viet Cong operated skilled 18 green

29
00:02:30.84 --> 00:02:35.60
berets in a carefully executed snake attack.

30
00:02:35.60 --> 00:02:40.56
The deadly side of Gorilla Warfare was brought home to him right there.

31
00:02:40.56 --> 00:02:42.52
He was in a war zone.

32
00:02:42.52 --> 00:02:45.44
The enemy didn't play by any set rules.

33
00:02:45.44 --> 00:02:48.48
It was an unsettling event.

34
00:02:48.48 --> 00:02:52.20
In the next morning, after breakfast, the trio walked over to S3 and chose their code

35
00:02:52.20 --> 00:02:53.20
names.

36
00:02:53.20 --> 00:02:59.76
The Chernobyl claskey and sure now became the Frenchman, Namu, and Bubba, names that would

37
00:02:59.76 --> 00:03:04.16
stick with them far beyond their tours of duty and Vietnam.

38
00:03:04.16 --> 00:03:09.40
Because S3 was temporarily located in the headquarters section of FOB IV since the attack,

39
00:03:09.40 --> 00:03:13.32
it was a quick shuffle into the briefing room with everyone else.

40
00:03:13.32 --> 00:03:18.24
An intense short, an intense, short, black-haired man wearing pajamas, slippers and

41
00:03:18.24 --> 00:03:22.16
a bathrobe walked in smoking a cigarette.

42
00:03:22.16 --> 00:03:27.32
Before a word was spoken, Colonel Warren abruptly pulled a white sheet off a large map with

43
00:03:27.32 --> 00:03:29.68
a flourish and tossed it aside.

44
00:03:29.68 --> 00:03:33.72
An announced welcome to C&C, man.

45
00:03:33.72 --> 00:03:39.28
Turning to the large map that had black tape, boxed target that it designators on it

46
00:03:39.28 --> 00:03:45.88
in Louss, the DMZ, and North Vietnam, he continued, this is what you volunteered for.

47
00:03:45.88 --> 00:03:48.20
This is why this is a top secret project.

48
00:03:48.20 --> 00:03:53.04
If anybody asks, the president can say we have no men stationed in the A.O.

49
00:03:53.04 --> 00:03:58.40
That is why you'll wear sterile fatigues and carry no form of identification of any kind

50
00:03:58.40 --> 00:04:00.32
on your missions.

51
00:04:00.32 --> 00:04:07.32
That's why you agreed not to talk to anyone about this operation for at least 20 years.

52
00:04:07.32 --> 00:04:11.24
Our intel reports land in the White House.

53
00:04:11.24 --> 00:04:13.24
Any questions?

54
00:04:13.24 --> 00:04:17.04
Not waiting for response, Warren continued to explain the difference between spiked teams

55
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:21.60
and hatched four settlements where the different F.O.Bs were located.

56
00:04:21.60 --> 00:04:27.04
How F.O.B. 3 at K-Son was closed after the siege earlier in the year and how major

57
00:04:27.04 --> 00:04:34.96
Clyde sincere junior had opened a site at my lock now designated F.O.B. 3.

58
00:04:34.96 --> 00:04:39.38
Following an update on intelligence reports in the respective areas of operations, Colonel

59
00:04:39.38 --> 00:04:42.92
Warren asked if anyone had any questions.

60
00:04:42.92 --> 00:04:48.20
Colonel raised his hand, where do you need help, sir?

61
00:04:48.20 --> 00:04:50.32
We need men at F.O.B. 1.

62
00:04:50.32 --> 00:04:56.08
We lost a 10 on October 5 and some of the first special forces T.D. Y troops from Okinawa

63
00:04:56.08 --> 00:04:58.72
are returning back to the island.

64
00:04:58.72 --> 00:05:02.72
The Chernows' shirt turned to short and McCloskey and asked, how about it?

65
00:05:02.72 --> 00:05:04.44
F.O.B. 1.

66
00:05:04.44 --> 00:05:06.16
Sure not it in the affirmative.

67
00:05:06.16 --> 00:05:09.68
McCloskey said, no, I think I'll stay here.

68
00:05:09.68 --> 00:05:14.68
The Chernows turned back to Warren and said, will go not in toward shore, surprised at McCloskey's

69
00:05:14.68 --> 00:05:16.40
response.

70
00:05:16.40 --> 00:05:20.20
Without missing a beat, Warren told the remainder of the SF troops in the room that he'd

71
00:05:20.20 --> 00:05:21.52
be right back.

72
00:05:21.52 --> 00:05:25.64
He turned to let Chernows and said, follow me as he headed out of the briefing room and into

73
00:05:25.64 --> 00:05:27.84
the S.3 Operation Center.

74
00:05:27.84 --> 00:05:33.08
He told the center staff to get a king B.O.B.4 in an hour to transport the Chernows and

75
00:05:33.08 --> 00:05:41.12
make sure to F.O.B. 1. ASAP.

76
00:05:41.12 --> 00:05:43.12
He headed to S.1 and told the clerk that the new bees were to be processed and clear to go to

77
00:05:43.12 --> 00:05:44.08
F.O.B.

78
00:05:44.08 --> 00:05:48.08
And now we're later, PFC, Laterno and spec 4.

79
00:05:48.08 --> 00:05:55.80
Sure, we're in a king B heading north to F.O.B.1.

80
00:05:55.80 --> 00:06:00.88
And that right there is an excerpt from the book across the fence, which was written by

81
00:06:00.88 --> 00:06:07.28
John Stryker Meyer, nicknamed Tilt, who's a special forces soldier and S.O.G. Recon

82
00:06:07.28 --> 00:06:09.28
leader in Vietnam.

83
00:06:09.28 --> 00:06:15.16
And we went deep with Tilt on podcast 181 and 182.

84
00:06:15.16 --> 00:06:18.48
And if you haven't listened to those podcasts, then stop this one right now and go back

85
00:06:18.48 --> 00:06:20.96
and listen to those first.

86
00:06:20.96 --> 00:06:26.04
But if you have already listened to those podcasts, then you heard a little bit about Doug

87
00:06:26.04 --> 00:06:32.20
Laterno code name, the Frenchman, and you know that he was also a special forces soldier

88
00:06:32.20 --> 00:06:37.28
Green Bore, and was also a sog team member in Vietnam.

89
00:06:37.28 --> 00:06:43.76
And it is an absolute honor to have not only Tilt back again on this podcast, but he

90
00:06:43.76 --> 00:06:47.84
brought with him the Frenchman himself, Doug Laterno.

91
00:06:47.84 --> 00:06:49.80
The one in the on the gentleman.

92
00:06:49.80 --> 00:06:51.56
Thank you for coming on.

93
00:06:51.56 --> 00:06:52.56
Good to see you again.

94
00:06:52.56 --> 00:06:53.56
Good evening, sir.

95
00:06:53.56 --> 00:06:54.56
Good evening.

96
00:06:54.56 --> 00:06:55.96
Thank you for having us.

97
00:06:55.96 --> 00:06:56.96
I'd great to be here.

98
00:06:56.96 --> 00:06:58.72
Great to have you both here.

99
00:06:58.72 --> 00:07:03.52
And yeah, let's talk a little bit about how you ended up that I mean, you glaze over

100
00:07:03.52 --> 00:07:08.16
the book, we're riding rodeo, Broncos, we're working in Hollywood, Taming Ant, animals, what

101
00:07:08.16 --> 00:07:11.24
was your upbringing that got you there?

102
00:07:11.24 --> 00:07:15.52
Believe it or not, I was born East LA in the barrio.

103
00:07:15.52 --> 00:07:17.88
Well, that makes sense.

104
00:07:17.88 --> 00:07:18.88
Not.

105
00:07:18.88 --> 00:07:19.88
Yeah.

106
00:07:19.88 --> 00:07:20.88
I know.

107
00:07:20.88 --> 00:07:25.92
So living in the city, I got fortunate enough.

108
00:07:25.92 --> 00:07:30.92
And I got into high school that I got into a program called the Future Farmers of America.

109
00:07:30.92 --> 00:07:35.08
And it gave me a whole different way of looking at life.

110
00:07:35.08 --> 00:07:38.40
And I ended up becoming a president of the chapter.

111
00:07:38.40 --> 00:07:45.04
But I had several Spanish speaking and Spanish people in our chapter, one of the largest

112
00:07:45.04 --> 00:07:49.20
in all of Southern California as it turned out.

113
00:07:49.20 --> 00:07:55.80
Well with these people, I could became such good friends and their way of life in

114
00:07:55.80 --> 00:08:01.16
still working the fields of the San Fernando Valley, which was still open.

115
00:08:01.16 --> 00:08:07.36
I tended to lean towards the country way of life, even though I was born and raised in the

116
00:08:07.36 --> 00:08:08.72
city.

117
00:08:08.72 --> 00:08:13.68
And I do nothing about anything at all, but city life.

118
00:08:13.68 --> 00:08:19.50
But I tried to break away from that through the organization and the Western end of the

119
00:08:19.50 --> 00:08:21.72
San Fernando Valley.

120
00:08:21.72 --> 00:08:28.84
Well, one thing led to another, and I learned about you could go rodeo.

121
00:08:28.84 --> 00:08:33.84
And there was a place that I could go ride and practice where you could do boom riding

122
00:08:33.84 --> 00:08:40.64
and bronch riding and bearback riding and all the three were in San Fernando Valley.

123
00:08:40.64 --> 00:08:44.84
This was actually out in thousand oaks at the Paramount Studios.

124
00:08:44.84 --> 00:08:45.84
Okay.

125
00:08:45.84 --> 00:08:47.64
Yeah, they had a ranch right there.

126
00:08:47.64 --> 00:08:52.000
And the decouper is what it was called, in those days.

127
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.48
And we could go out on the Wednesday night and Saturday and Sunday and ride and have jack

128
00:08:57.48 --> 00:08:59.80
pots and I got into it.

129
00:08:59.80 --> 00:09:05.64
And then one thing led to another, I got into college and I got on the college intercollegiate

130
00:09:05.64 --> 00:09:08.16
team and we traveled and rodeoed.

131
00:09:08.16 --> 00:09:15.36
And as I went through college, I became a dep to it and I got into rope and with rope

132
00:09:15.36 --> 00:09:20.84
and horses and owned my own rope horse and it just the way a life changed from being a

133
00:09:20.84 --> 00:09:23.64
city slicker to a cowboy.

134
00:09:23.64 --> 00:09:25.16
Where did you go to college?

135
00:09:25.16 --> 00:09:29.64
I started out at Pierce Junior College in Woodland Hills.

136
00:09:29.64 --> 00:09:30.64
Okay.

137
00:09:30.64 --> 00:09:32.04
The shaft for not a valley.

138
00:09:32.04 --> 00:09:34.20
And then ended up with Cal Poly.

139
00:09:34.20 --> 00:09:35.20
Okay.

140
00:09:35.20 --> 00:09:37.48
San Louis Abyssable, Mustanger.

141
00:09:37.48 --> 00:09:38.48
Yeah.

142
00:09:38.48 --> 00:09:40.28
So, through courses there.

143
00:09:40.28 --> 00:09:53.08
And but basically, we just just kept on going and then with the TV series, we're popular,

144
00:09:53.08 --> 00:09:54.72
we're a lot of animals.

145
00:09:54.72 --> 00:10:00.20
There was an opening to be a wild animal trainer at Africa, USA and San Canyon, New

146
00:10:00.20 --> 00:10:01.20
Hall.

147
00:10:01.20 --> 00:10:02.84
So, I jumped up there.

148
00:10:02.84 --> 00:10:04.60
How old are you at this point?

149
00:10:04.60 --> 00:10:05.60
I'm 20.

150
00:10:05.60 --> 00:10:06.60
Yeah.

151
00:10:06.60 --> 00:10:07.60
Okay.

152
00:10:07.60 --> 00:10:09.60
Wild animal trainer sounds like, you know, yeah.

153
00:10:09.60 --> 00:10:10.60
That's another day of college.

154
00:10:10.60 --> 00:10:11.60
There you go.

155
00:10:11.60 --> 00:10:16.60
So, I jumped up there and before I knew it, I was handling Clarence, the cross-sided line,

156
00:10:16.60 --> 00:10:18.44
and Judy the Chimp.

157
00:10:18.44 --> 00:10:24.000
And then they had a rope horse there that they used and they wanted me to call Dakota Duke

158
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.72
and they wanted me to go out and capture all these animals by rope and them.

159
00:10:28.72 --> 00:10:30.36
And they knew I could rope.

160
00:10:30.36 --> 00:10:35.12
There's actual picture of me on the front of the pig and string that was produced

161
00:10:35.12 --> 00:10:38.40
out of landcaster and low valley.

162
00:10:38.40 --> 00:10:40.84
Of me on the front cover, rope and a tiger.

163
00:10:40.84 --> 00:10:41.84
Off of this horse.

164
00:10:41.84 --> 00:10:42.84
Off of this horse.

165
00:10:42.84 --> 00:10:43.84
Off of this horse.

166
00:10:43.84 --> 00:10:44.84
And that's what I did.

167
00:10:44.84 --> 00:10:52.08
And I rope the elephants and I rope, you know, healed them and I healed giraffes and I

168
00:10:52.08 --> 00:10:53.08
headed up.

169
00:10:53.08 --> 00:10:54.44
White Rhino form.

170
00:10:54.44 --> 00:10:59.08
There was a common attest and I turned them back and you know, they would do all

171
00:10:59.08 --> 00:11:03.08
these, what they call a veil, a veil would be open land.

172
00:11:03.08 --> 00:11:05.96
It's an African term.

173
00:11:05.96 --> 00:11:11.88
And we just would turn these animals loose but somebody had to go get them.

174
00:11:11.88 --> 00:11:18.76
So I actually got to work on the TV series that was very popular called Doc Tari.

175
00:11:18.76 --> 00:11:22.76
And people would see the trucks, they were zebra trucks.

176
00:11:22.76 --> 00:11:26.28
I went on YouTube and checked out some Doc Tari old footage.

177
00:11:26.28 --> 00:11:27.28
Oh, yeah.

178
00:11:27.28 --> 00:11:28.28
Classic show.

179
00:11:28.28 --> 00:11:29.28
Really.

180
00:11:29.28 --> 00:11:33.76
And but it was shot in like Africa but actually it was all done right there new all the

181
00:11:33.76 --> 00:11:36.36
soldiers, you know, at the compound.

182
00:11:36.36 --> 00:11:44.40
And so from there, we ran into a series called Cowboy in Africa and we brought Chuck

183
00:11:44.40 --> 00:11:51.64
Conner's in it and he was the star and he will Brian had actually done the original movie.

184
00:11:51.64 --> 00:11:56.52
There's of Cowboy in Africa and they shot it in Africa but here they're going to shoot

185
00:11:56.52 --> 00:11:58.76
it here in the United States.

186
00:11:58.76 --> 00:12:02.88
And so I got to work with ostriches and all kinds of different animals that they had

187
00:12:02.88 --> 00:12:09.32
to have around the compound of the house that he was working out of in the series.

188
00:12:09.32 --> 00:12:16.32
But one thing left to another but as it turned out, one night somebody handed me an old

189
00:12:16.32 --> 00:12:17.32
ragged book.

190
00:12:17.32 --> 00:12:23.40
It's called the Green Brava, Robin Moore and I looked out it and I read it and I couldn't

191
00:12:23.40 --> 00:12:25.68
put it down.

192
00:12:25.68 --> 00:12:31.64
And I said, this has got to be something that this Vietnam war has been going on for quite

193
00:12:31.64 --> 00:12:32.64
a while.

194
00:12:32.64 --> 00:12:35.08
I grew up almost listening to it every day.

195
00:12:35.08 --> 00:12:39.40
This got to be something going on that I need to contribute.

196
00:12:39.40 --> 00:12:41.12
And I think this is what I want to do.

197
00:12:41.12 --> 00:12:45.84
I went down the next day, very next day and signed up.

198
00:12:45.84 --> 00:12:47.44
What's the year was that now old?

199
00:12:47.44 --> 00:12:48.44
Where you?

200
00:12:48.44 --> 00:12:53.52
I was 20 and this was like September just before.

201
00:12:53.52 --> 00:13:01.04
It was like, I let's say because I went in September first so it was the day before.

202
00:13:01.04 --> 00:13:06.56
So August 30th of what year though?

203
00:13:06.56 --> 00:13:07.56
1968.

204
00:13:07.56 --> 00:13:08.56
1967.

205
00:13:08.56 --> 00:13:09.56
1967.

206
00:13:09.56 --> 00:13:10.56
1967.

207
00:13:10.56 --> 00:13:11.56
Yes.

208
00:13:11.56 --> 00:13:17.76
And I actually entered the service in September first 1967.

209
00:13:17.76 --> 00:13:22.92
But at that time he had obtained a college degree by attending classes at night.

210
00:13:22.92 --> 00:13:26.36
So instead of going through the four year program, the college was three years.

211
00:13:26.36 --> 00:13:28.80
Well, I graduated when I was 17.

212
00:13:28.80 --> 00:13:31.36
From high school, I was early.

213
00:13:31.36 --> 00:13:32.88
It was the classes at night.

214
00:13:32.88 --> 00:13:33.88
Yeah.

215
00:13:33.88 --> 00:13:34.88
That's fair time.

216
00:13:34.88 --> 00:13:42.32
And like the attitude towards the Vietnam war in 1967, you know, from the, I mean,

217
00:13:42.32 --> 00:13:48.04
when we think of Hollywood now, we think of people that just are, you know, just detest

218
00:13:48.04 --> 00:13:51.04
everything it has to do with the military most of the time.

219
00:13:51.04 --> 00:13:54.56
And you were kind of in that Hollywood scene hanging around with all these people, but

220
00:13:54.56 --> 00:13:56.56
that didn't rub off on you at all.

221
00:13:56.56 --> 00:13:58.48
It didn't happen that way.

222
00:13:58.48 --> 00:14:02.80
In 1967, 1968, it wasn't like that back then.

223
00:14:02.80 --> 00:14:05.88
I was shocked when I got back.

224
00:14:05.88 --> 00:14:13.48
And I actually visited Bubba on, on Peach Street in Atlanta, Georgia.

225
00:14:13.48 --> 00:14:20.28
And there was an anti-Rally Vietnam rally going down the street.

226
00:14:20.28 --> 00:14:24.48
And I looked out the window and I said, Bubba, what in the world is that?

227
00:14:24.48 --> 00:14:27.84
He says, those are, and I wore protesters.

228
00:14:27.84 --> 00:14:30.08
I'd never seen it, never heard of it.

229
00:14:30.08 --> 00:14:33.92
But in 67, everybody was still pretty patriotic.

230
00:14:33.92 --> 00:14:34.92
God.

231
00:14:34.92 --> 00:14:36.76
And didn't have that situation.

232
00:14:36.76 --> 00:14:40.08
And now, what about your old man?

233
00:14:40.08 --> 00:14:45.96
Who was, you know, he was, you were raised as the son of a guy that was a B-17 pilot?

234
00:14:45.96 --> 00:14:46.96
Yes.

235
00:14:46.96 --> 00:14:50.08
A war hero in itself.

236
00:14:50.08 --> 00:14:51.92
He ran 13 missions.

237
00:14:51.92 --> 00:14:58.16
He was actually a first two missions in, were over Berlin.

238
00:14:58.16 --> 00:15:01.92
He was on the first two missions, the bomb Berlin itself.

239
00:15:01.92 --> 00:15:07.20
But he flew 13 missions on his 13th mission.

240
00:15:07.20 --> 00:15:11.52
They gave him a brand new airplane because his airplane had been shot up so bad with his

241
00:15:11.52 --> 00:15:16.80
crew that he brought from the United States and flew it over to England that they had

242
00:15:16.80 --> 00:15:19.52
to give him a brand new airplane that morning.

243
00:15:19.52 --> 00:15:23.24
He took off and he had 999 planes behind him.

244
00:15:23.24 --> 00:15:26.20
He was a point that day.

245
00:15:26.20 --> 00:15:29.76
And he went over a target called Shwainford.

246
00:15:29.76 --> 00:15:37.32
As it turned out, Shwainford had lost 56 airplanes.

247
00:15:37.32 --> 00:15:45.56
And this day, his entire squadron of 22 out of 23 were to be shot down that day.

248
00:15:45.56 --> 00:15:52.000
And he was the first one down and they were using new tactics, the Nazis were.

249
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.32
They were line up of mission smiths and 109s.

250
00:15:58.32 --> 00:16:01.48
And in a row, in go right through them.

251
00:16:01.48 --> 00:16:06.24
Instead of coming around or going on top, they just go right through them.

252
00:16:06.24 --> 00:16:09.20
They didn't care if they lost the planes or not.

253
00:16:09.20 --> 00:16:14.52
And then they had, um, folk with 190s behind them.

254
00:16:14.52 --> 00:16:21.12
And they took out all these planes in the very lead just to start the battle.

255
00:16:21.12 --> 00:16:24.76
But nobody could ever figure out why Shwainford was so protected.

256
00:16:24.76 --> 00:16:29.04
And so many losses every time that was tried to be bombed.

257
00:16:29.04 --> 00:16:35.56
And Gary, during the Nuremberg trials, he admitted that it was the only ball bearing factory

258
00:16:35.56 --> 00:16:40.52
that Germans owned without ball bearings or war would have been over with in a matter

259
00:16:40.52 --> 00:16:42.52
of a few months.

260
00:16:42.52 --> 00:16:48.56
And this whole war went on and on and on because neither the British or the US could figure

261
00:16:48.56 --> 00:16:49.92
figure that out.

262
00:16:49.92 --> 00:16:52.92
And they should have bobbed it every day as what he said.

263
00:16:52.92 --> 00:16:56.80
And if they would, the war would have been over with, they would have had the surrender.

264
00:16:56.80 --> 00:16:59.48
But just the quirk in the whole situation.

265
00:16:59.48 --> 00:17:05.32
But my dad ended up being my first airborne person in our family.

266
00:17:05.32 --> 00:17:08.24
He involved in the military and we're involved in it.

267
00:17:08.24 --> 00:17:09.24
And Halo.

268
00:17:09.24 --> 00:17:10.24
And he taught himself.

269
00:17:10.24 --> 00:17:12.44
What else did you really find out?

270
00:17:12.44 --> 00:17:16.56
10,000 feet when he jumped because his plane caught on fire.

271
00:17:16.56 --> 00:17:17.84
And they couldn't extinguish it.

272
00:17:17.84 --> 00:17:19.56
His engines were on fire.

273
00:17:19.56 --> 00:17:21.28
And he couldn't open the bomb bay doors.

274
00:17:21.28 --> 00:17:23.72
The hydraulic system had been shot up.

275
00:17:23.72 --> 00:17:29.48
He had a radio operator had a 20 millimeter right through his stomach and they had to put

276
00:17:29.48 --> 00:17:34.60
a parachute on him and just shoving him out the bottom door.

277
00:17:34.60 --> 00:17:37.40
And it was pretty hectic.

278
00:17:37.40 --> 00:17:44.64
The plane blew up in mid-air but those that could got out and made the free fall to the

279
00:17:44.64 --> 00:17:48.20
ground and pulled their shoots.

280
00:17:48.20 --> 00:17:56.28
And anyway, my dad was attacked by farmers with pitchforks and thank God the Kostapo and

281
00:17:56.28 --> 00:18:02.20
the SS were there to retrieve him and push the farmers back.

282
00:18:02.20 --> 00:18:04.88
He thought he was going to die right there in the hole.

283
00:18:04.88 --> 00:18:08.80
He sprained his ankle and he was kind of out of it.

284
00:18:08.80 --> 00:18:14.44
But anyway, they haul him off and strung him up and tried to make him talk and the usual

285
00:18:14.44 --> 00:18:17.12
serial number name and rank.

286
00:18:17.12 --> 00:18:23.20
And then they put him in Stahlog 1 which was an officer camp.

287
00:18:23.20 --> 00:18:28.24
It had 15,000 officers that had been shot down in that camp.

288
00:18:28.24 --> 00:18:31.64
All the enlisted men went to enlisted Stahlogs.

289
00:18:31.64 --> 00:18:37.64
And he served 13 months in the POW camp and then one morning they woke up and the Russians

290
00:18:37.64 --> 00:18:39.04
were there.

291
00:18:39.04 --> 00:18:50.92
The Russians liberated him and he was taken home and that's the story and he became well

292
00:18:50.92 --> 00:18:56.12
known for in our town or what he did.

293
00:18:56.12 --> 00:19:01.64
And I see how two brothers and my uncle Larmon was given a silver star of our patent, General

294
00:19:01.64 --> 00:19:05.84
Patton himself and friends pinned on his chest.

295
00:19:05.84 --> 00:19:09.76
And my uncle Eddie flew course errors.

296
00:19:09.76 --> 00:19:11.76
So the literal brothers were quite active.

297
00:19:11.76 --> 00:19:12.96
Okay, that's what they were.

298
00:19:12.96 --> 00:19:14.44
So I had a lot to follow.

299
00:19:14.44 --> 00:19:15.44
Yeah, he did.

300
00:19:15.44 --> 00:19:16.44
Jesus.

301
00:19:16.44 --> 00:19:17.44
So I ran there.

302
00:19:17.44 --> 00:19:19.84
I ran 13 missions.

303
00:19:19.84 --> 00:19:21.84
How ironic, right?

304
00:19:21.84 --> 00:19:22.84
That is.

305
00:19:22.84 --> 00:19:27.12
The ran 13 missions in one bright light.

306
00:19:27.12 --> 00:19:29.36
When your dad came home, what did he do?

307
00:19:29.36 --> 00:19:30.76
Did he get out of the army?

308
00:19:30.76 --> 00:19:31.76
Did he?

309
00:19:31.76 --> 00:19:32.76
Well, it was a Army Air Corps.

310
00:19:32.76 --> 00:19:35.16
And those days it wasn't the Air Force.

311
00:19:35.16 --> 00:19:42.28
And so he tried doing a little bartending and a little this, a little that.

312
00:19:42.28 --> 00:19:44.04
But he had been in construction.

313
00:19:44.04 --> 00:19:49.08
He actually was partnered up with his, my grandfather, my grandfather, my grandparents.

314
00:19:49.08 --> 00:19:52.28
And it was Laterno and Laterno construction company.

315
00:19:52.28 --> 00:19:59.84
And he filtered back into the construction and started building because they needed homes.

316
00:19:59.84 --> 00:20:02.12
Every all these soldiers coming home.

317
00:20:02.12 --> 00:20:05.76
And he built most of Burbank, Glendale at the time.

318
00:20:05.76 --> 00:20:11.08
And that did always did quite well and got into commercial buildings.

319
00:20:11.08 --> 00:20:18.04
And I sort of followed into those footsteps eventually after I got back from the service.

320
00:20:18.04 --> 00:20:22.36
After when you, when you enlisted, what did your dad feel about that?

321
00:20:22.36 --> 00:20:28.40
Well, he was not happy about it because he only gave him a day's notice.

322
00:20:28.40 --> 00:20:32.32
And I said, I'm going, I'm going into the service.

323
00:20:32.32 --> 00:20:35.48
I'm going to go to Vietnam and I'm going to be a green beret.

324
00:20:35.48 --> 00:20:38.96
But of course, when we, and I enlisted, they couldn't give me that.

325
00:20:38.96 --> 00:20:45.000
It was the only MLS that they could not give because it wasn't guaranteed.

326
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.68
They could guarantee me anything else.

327
00:20:46.68 --> 00:20:49.72
They wanted me to be an officer because I had a degree.

328
00:20:49.72 --> 00:20:52.12
And I said, no, I'm not going to go to OCS.

329
00:20:52.12 --> 00:20:57.68
I want to go and be whatever it takes to be in special forces.

330
00:20:57.68 --> 00:21:03.44
As it turned out in the long run, whether you really want to hear the whole story, it's

331
00:21:03.44 --> 00:21:04.44
up to you.

332
00:21:04.44 --> 00:21:12.12
But I did end up being a green beret and going through all the processes and going through

333
00:21:12.12 --> 00:21:16.56
all the volunteer and being accepted and going into it.

334
00:21:16.56 --> 00:21:18.64
And I passed it.

335
00:21:18.64 --> 00:21:23.64
But during that time, I'm, you have to realize, I'm just an E2.

336
00:21:23.64 --> 00:21:24.96
I went in as an E1.

337
00:21:24.96 --> 00:21:27.40
I'm an E2.

338
00:21:27.40 --> 00:21:30.92
I'm the lowest ranking there is.

339
00:21:30.92 --> 00:21:40.32
And the MLS that I actually graduated with was a prized MLS that only a few would maintain.

340
00:21:40.32 --> 00:21:42.92
And that was heavy weapons.

341
00:21:42.92 --> 00:21:47.36
You can't be heavy weapons unless you're an E5 or a bov.

342
00:21:47.36 --> 00:21:53.44
But when my turn came up to go in front of the panel, my name being an L, that's made

343
00:21:53.44 --> 00:21:54.76
it documented.

344
00:21:54.76 --> 00:21:56.92
That's why I can say this.

345
00:21:56.92 --> 00:22:04.20
I was the first E2 ever to be accepted for weapons MLS training.

346
00:22:04.20 --> 00:22:06.52
Because I told them exactly what I had in mind.

347
00:22:06.52 --> 00:22:09.72
I said, come Monday morning, we've already gone through our phase one.

348
00:22:09.72 --> 00:22:13.24
And I've got my green beret.

349
00:22:13.24 --> 00:22:16.04
And I said, we need to go into MLS.

350
00:22:16.04 --> 00:22:18.28
And this is what Monday I can start.

351
00:22:18.28 --> 00:22:24.84
I said, when that MLS is done, it so happens phase two of graduation exercise.

352
00:22:24.84 --> 00:22:28.44
The one here go out in the field for two weeks in survival mode.

353
00:22:28.44 --> 00:22:32.76
I said, it will start immediately the following Monday.

354
00:22:32.76 --> 00:22:38.76
And I said, and I can be in Vietnam in the next three months.

355
00:22:38.76 --> 00:22:42.88
And they looked at me and said, you got it.

356
00:22:42.88 --> 00:22:50.56
So if you look at the orders, everything from L to Z, there was E2 E3 E4 was in my weapons

357
00:22:50.56 --> 00:22:52.36
class.

358
00:22:52.36 --> 00:22:57.44
Because I started something that couldn't be turned back, the tide had been turned.

359
00:22:57.44 --> 00:23:06.84
So what I got to Vietnam and my first assignment to FOB1, I'm now a PFC E3.

360
00:23:06.84 --> 00:23:17.32
And Pat Watkins, who has the DSC, the Stingray Service Cross from his time on August 23,

361
00:23:17.32 --> 00:23:24.72
when FOB4 was attacked, he told everybody, there must be one bad son of a bitch coming

362
00:23:24.72 --> 00:23:29.40
up here because he's a PFC, he's 11 Charlie S, SF.

363
00:23:29.40 --> 00:23:31.40
He's been busted down so far.

364
00:23:31.40 --> 00:23:34.92
He's got to be about a soldier working on the land.

365
00:23:34.92 --> 00:23:41.92
I don't know what I showed up and he looked at me, he goes, you are a PFC.

366
00:23:41.92 --> 00:23:46.12
This is how it's green, his grass and the new nut leaf.

367
00:23:46.12 --> 00:23:47.68
Just been trained hard.

368
00:23:47.68 --> 00:23:51.32
That's a good way to kick it off, man.

369
00:23:51.32 --> 00:23:52.92
Yeah, up on FOB1.

370
00:23:52.92 --> 00:23:53.92
Yeah, yeah.

371
00:23:53.92 --> 00:23:58.52
What is you going through the how long was the block of training that you, so you go through

372
00:23:58.52 --> 00:24:00.76
boot camp, how long was the SF training?

373
00:24:00.76 --> 00:24:01.76
Was that total?

374
00:24:01.76 --> 00:24:06.32
Well, I had to go through boot camp and that's where I had to volunteer to even be

375
00:24:06.32 --> 00:24:12.80
go through the acceptance of trying to be a sign to SF training.

376
00:24:12.80 --> 00:24:18.24
Then I went into advanced AIT, which is advanced infantry training, you had to go through

377
00:24:18.24 --> 00:24:19.24
that.

378
00:24:19.24 --> 00:24:22.36
And you also had to sign up for airborne training.

379
00:24:22.36 --> 00:24:30.08
So you had to go through all the basics and come out as an 11B, which was a small infantry

380
00:24:30.08 --> 00:24:31.72
arms.

381
00:24:31.72 --> 00:24:37.08
So anyway, then jumpschool.

382
00:24:37.08 --> 00:24:38.08
Yeah, jumpschool.

383
00:24:38.08 --> 00:24:44.76
But I went through the nomination part of it taking tests and physical tests and swimming,

384
00:24:44.76 --> 00:24:45.76
everything.

385
00:24:45.76 --> 00:24:51.08
And then interviews with the SF guys that were there that were in charge of selecting who

386
00:24:51.08 --> 00:24:52.24
was going to go.

387
00:24:52.24 --> 00:24:57.72
We started out with 350 men volunteering to go through this acceptance.

388
00:24:57.72 --> 00:25:01.96
They only took 35, and the end of the deal, I was one of the 35.

389
00:25:01.96 --> 00:25:08.84
I went on to airborne school the next day and went through jump school at Fort Benning,

390
00:25:08.84 --> 00:25:09.84
Georgia.

391
00:25:09.84 --> 00:25:15.40
They put us after our last jump, which was out of the old Boscar, 119s.

392
00:25:15.40 --> 00:25:19.000
And then they came in with the new jets.

393
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.56
So I kind of proud of that.

394
00:25:22.56 --> 00:25:28.32
And we went on a bus that night all the way to Fort Bragg and got there in the early

395
00:25:28.32 --> 00:25:32.12
morning hours of Saturday, Saturday, a morning.

396
00:25:32.12 --> 00:25:38.92
And then Monday morning, we were information for our very first day of training and special

397
00:25:38.92 --> 00:25:40.20
forces.

398
00:25:40.20 --> 00:25:49.08
And that block there was two weeks out in survival phase one, then eight weeks of training

399
00:25:49.08 --> 00:25:55.32
after that, and then another two weeks of our graduation exercises where we're trained

400
00:25:55.32 --> 00:25:56.84
to overtake a government.

401
00:25:56.84 --> 00:26:01.52
That's what some of the forces does is actually overtake over governments and trained

402
00:26:01.52 --> 00:26:03.48
guerrillas to do so.

403
00:26:03.48 --> 00:26:08.000
And so then 30 days later, I was in Vietnam.

404
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.52
Was the, I'm sure the focus must have been like a hundred percent on the, hey, you're going

405
00:26:12.52 --> 00:26:13.52
to Vietnam.

406
00:26:13.52 --> 00:26:14.52
We know you're going to Vietnam.

407
00:26:14.52 --> 00:26:15.52
This is what it's going to be like.

408
00:26:15.52 --> 00:26:16.88
This is what you're dealing with.

409
00:26:16.88 --> 00:26:23.12
And I graduated the Colonel, stood in front of us, the head of all of trading group and

410
00:26:23.12 --> 00:26:28.44
said, I don't want, I want to view to volunteer for fifth group, but Vietnam, we spent too

411
00:26:28.44 --> 00:26:30.32
much money on you.

412
00:26:30.32 --> 00:26:32.52
You're just going to go there and die.

413
00:26:32.52 --> 00:26:34.64
You stay here, pick any other group.

414
00:26:34.64 --> 00:26:38.68
I'm going to go down the line with the command sergeant major and he's going to tell

415
00:26:38.68 --> 00:26:41.20
me what group you want to go to.

416
00:26:41.20 --> 00:26:50.44
I had 23 graduates in my class, all but three volunteer Vietnam.

417
00:26:50.44 --> 00:26:52.72
He was not happy.

418
00:26:52.72 --> 00:26:53.72
What?

419
00:26:53.72 --> 00:26:58.52
I thought, yeah, you think like, why does why is someone during the Vietnam War going

420
00:26:58.52 --> 00:27:01.28
to join special forces or must they want to go to Vietnam?

421
00:27:01.28 --> 00:27:03.04
I mean, exactly.

422
00:27:03.04 --> 00:27:06.08
But in my mind, there was something wrong.

423
00:27:06.08 --> 00:27:09.52
It had been going on for years.

424
00:27:09.52 --> 00:27:16.16
And special forces had been there before it was a war, advising.

425
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:19.36
And I just could not figure that out.

426
00:27:19.36 --> 00:27:20.52
And I said, I've got to go.

427
00:27:20.52 --> 00:27:23.12
I've got to see why is taking so long.

428
00:27:23.12 --> 00:27:25.60
It's taking longer than the World War II.

429
00:27:25.60 --> 00:27:27.20
Now it's five years.

430
00:27:27.20 --> 00:27:30.36
So why is it taking so long?

431
00:27:30.36 --> 00:27:33.80
So I said, I've got to get there and do something about it.

432
00:27:33.80 --> 00:27:36.56
That's how I, my attitude was.

433
00:27:36.56 --> 00:27:40.60
Friends, friends, come on, he's going to handle this thing.

434
00:27:40.60 --> 00:27:42.88
You see, oh, I see.

435
00:27:42.88 --> 00:27:43.88
Yeah.

436
00:27:43.88 --> 00:27:45.000
I'm going to go to the book here.

437
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.92
This is going back to across the fence.

438
00:27:46.92 --> 00:27:51.84
And obviously, I told everyone to buy this because I've been reading chunks of it.

439
00:27:51.84 --> 00:27:56.52
And if you haven't bought it yet, just buy it right now.

440
00:27:56.52 --> 00:27:57.84
Written by John Streccharmire.

441
00:27:57.84 --> 00:28:01.20
So this is a section where he's writing about the Frenchman.

442
00:28:01.20 --> 00:28:02.20
So here we go.

443
00:28:02.20 --> 00:28:05.32
Within 24 hours, the turnover and store were on recon teams at F.O.B.1.

444
00:28:05.32 --> 00:28:07.36
And they immediately began training.

445
00:28:07.36 --> 00:28:12.40
Immediately reaction drills, weapons and explosive training, reviewing team S.O.P.'s, practicing

446
00:28:12.40 --> 00:28:16.84
helicopter extractions on strings and practicing wire taps.

447
00:28:16.84 --> 00:28:21.76
As October yielded to November, many of the members of the two recon teams began to build

448
00:28:21.76 --> 00:28:26.32
a rapport because they were doing so much training together on the food buy range.

449
00:28:26.32 --> 00:28:30.58
In addition, the turnover and store also quickly learned that the veteran indigenous

450
00:28:30.58 --> 00:28:35.08
personnel on their teams were highly skilled and fearless warriors.

451
00:28:35.08 --> 00:28:39.64
One night, while the turnover was recording a verbal message for his parents on his portable

452
00:28:39.64 --> 00:28:45.28
cassette player, LAP, the young point man on ST Virginia, came into his room and spoke

453
00:28:45.28 --> 00:28:46.76
into the recorder.

454
00:28:46.76 --> 00:28:50.64
I want to tell you parents of private literno, not to worry about him.

455
00:28:50.64 --> 00:28:52.84
We respect him and I'll keep an eye out for him.

456
00:28:52.84 --> 00:28:53.84
And don't worry.

457
00:28:53.84 --> 00:28:56.88
If in any of me shoots at him, I'll catch the bullets with my body.

458
00:28:56.88 --> 00:28:58.44
I'll protect your son.

459
00:28:58.44 --> 00:29:00.80
Thank you for sending you to him to Vietnam.

460
00:29:00.80 --> 00:29:01.80
He's a good soldier.

461
00:29:01.80 --> 00:29:10.80
That was, the kid was like 16 years old and he was our point man.

462
00:29:10.80 --> 00:29:14.000
Who knows how many kills he had.

463
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.36
He was fearless.

464
00:29:15.36 --> 00:29:17.48
His parents had been both killed.

465
00:29:17.48 --> 00:29:19.80
He was an adoptee in the song.

466
00:29:19.80 --> 00:29:24.20
He was raised and lived in Foughton, sock.

467
00:29:24.20 --> 00:29:31.12
And he prided himself on trying to learn how to speak English because he wanted to be number

468
00:29:31.12 --> 00:29:36.12
one interpreter.

469
00:29:36.12 --> 00:29:38.08
Yeah, how do your parents like that?

470
00:29:38.08 --> 00:29:39.52
Did they ever get the tape?

471
00:29:39.52 --> 00:29:40.52
They got the tape.

472
00:29:40.52 --> 00:29:43.92
Yeah, I wish I knew where they were.

473
00:29:43.92 --> 00:29:46.92
They passed away and we couldn't find them.

474
00:29:46.92 --> 00:29:50.24
But yeah, it was amazing.

475
00:29:50.24 --> 00:29:55.52
And my dad knew right then and there I wasn't coming home.

476
00:29:55.52 --> 00:29:57.88
He knew I wasn't coming home.

477
00:29:57.88 --> 00:30:02.04
And he didn't, he had to try to keep my mother from figuring that out.

478
00:30:02.04 --> 00:30:08.36
But he knew that I would not be let come home because of the secret missions.

479
00:30:08.36 --> 00:30:13.72
He figured they would, the government would take me out before they would let me come home

480
00:30:13.72 --> 00:30:15.44
with what I knew.

481
00:30:15.44 --> 00:30:19.88
And lap was the kind of view that me, South Vietnamese ally that you never heard about,

482
00:30:19.88 --> 00:30:23.24
that we worked with every day and we're alive today thanks to them.

483
00:30:23.24 --> 00:30:25.20
We are alive, too.

484
00:30:25.20 --> 00:30:26.20
Oh yeah.

485
00:30:26.20 --> 00:30:28.04
We do.

486
00:30:28.04 --> 00:30:29.44
And a couple of canybee pilots.

487
00:30:29.44 --> 00:30:30.44
Yeah.

488
00:30:30.44 --> 00:30:31.44
It's true.

489
00:30:31.44 --> 00:30:34.12
Extractions.

490
00:30:34.12 --> 00:30:38.60
I have 13 string extractions.

491
00:30:38.60 --> 00:30:39.92
13 for 13?

492
00:30:39.92 --> 00:30:41.76
Yes.

493
00:30:41.76 --> 00:30:44.20
Lucky 13 right now.

494
00:30:44.20 --> 00:30:50.72
So my dad said, he had 1,300 bombing hours, flight hours.

495
00:30:50.72 --> 00:30:52.80
But he also had 13 months in a POW.

496
00:30:52.80 --> 00:30:56.84
And it was a little shot down on Friday the 13th.

497
00:30:56.84 --> 00:30:57.84
April 13th.

498
00:30:57.84 --> 00:30:59.84
April 14th.

499
00:30:59.84 --> 00:31:02.84
No superstition here, huh?

500
00:31:02.84 --> 00:31:03.84
No.

501
00:31:03.84 --> 00:31:04.84
Yes.

502
00:31:04.84 --> 00:31:06.84
All right.

503
00:31:06.84 --> 00:31:08.84
Continuing on.

504
00:31:08.84 --> 00:31:13.92
A few days before Thanksgiving, ST Virginia's 10 children announced that an operation

505
00:31:13.92 --> 00:31:16.88
ordered come down from the S3.

506
00:31:16.88 --> 00:31:21.40
The team had a mission in the western section of the DMZ.

507
00:31:21.40 --> 00:31:25.28
And then I'm going to fast forward a little bit here to a guy named MacGovern.

508
00:31:25.28 --> 00:31:30.64
Quiet spoken, MacGovern gave him a riot half smile and said, we can't have that.

509
00:31:30.64 --> 00:31:33.24
You need to have a car 15 for your first mission.

510
00:31:33.24 --> 00:31:34.24
Follow me.

511
00:31:34.24 --> 00:31:36.44
The duo walked over the MacGovern's room.

512
00:31:36.44 --> 00:31:40.44
He opened his locker and pulled out a clean car 15 and handed it to the turno.

513
00:31:40.44 --> 00:31:42.64
This is a special car 15 he said.

514
00:31:42.64 --> 00:31:47.44
According to official army records, this car 15 was written off as a combat loss at

515
00:31:47.44 --> 00:31:51.20
FOB3 in case on, meaning as far as the army is concerned, this weapon does

516
00:31:51.20 --> 00:31:52.64
and exists.

517
00:31:52.64 --> 00:31:56.40
Some day after successful tour of duty and Vietnam, if you're so inclined, you can take

518
00:31:56.40 --> 00:31:59.72
this baby home with you because it doesn't exist.

519
00:31:59.72 --> 00:32:03.52
But as you can see, it does and it's a sweet weapon.

520
00:32:03.52 --> 00:32:04.72
It never failed me.

521
00:32:04.72 --> 00:32:08.64
And I know that since your weapons man, you'll take good care of it.

522
00:32:08.64 --> 00:32:12.72
Up to this point, let's turno and use an M16 for all of this training now with his car

523
00:32:12.72 --> 00:32:13.72
15.

524
00:32:13.72 --> 00:32:16.32
He was ready to take on the world.

525
00:32:16.32 --> 00:32:17.32
True.

526
00:32:17.32 --> 00:32:21.76
It was a mean weapon.

527
00:32:21.76 --> 00:32:23.64
You see it in that picture.

528
00:32:23.64 --> 00:32:24.64
Yeah.

529
00:32:24.64 --> 00:32:26.64
The book has the picture of it.

530
00:32:26.64 --> 00:32:28.64
Yeah.

531
00:32:28.64 --> 00:32:32.28
And just rocking those 20 round mags.

532
00:32:32.28 --> 00:32:35.52
Every time I see those pictures of you guys with those 20 round mags, I just, I just, I

533
00:32:35.52 --> 00:32:38.84
just, I carry 25 of them.

534
00:32:38.84 --> 00:32:41.44
Stuffed into the canteen covers.

535
00:32:41.44 --> 00:32:45.28
We didn't carry food per se.

536
00:32:45.28 --> 00:32:54.52
All my food, I had zippers, sewed into my sleeves, up all my shoulders, left and right.

537
00:32:54.52 --> 00:33:00.72
And I would roll up, dry, dehydrated rice with electrical tape.

538
00:33:00.72 --> 00:33:06.36
Instead of one full ration, I took one full ration of food and cut it into five different

539
00:33:06.36 --> 00:33:10.16
days from maximum output.

540
00:33:10.16 --> 00:33:15.12
And we only ate once a day and we just put, we only had four courts of water because

541
00:33:15.12 --> 00:33:18.76
we didn't want to carry any more weight or anything else.

542
00:33:18.76 --> 00:33:25.60
But ammunition, we carried all ammunition grenades, M79 shells because we carried sawdough,

543
00:33:25.60 --> 00:33:27.80
M79s.

544
00:33:27.80 --> 00:33:34.48
And so that's all we carried was ammunition because when we go in, that's our supply.

545
00:33:34.48 --> 00:33:36.32
There's no resupply.

546
00:33:36.32 --> 00:33:38.08
It's all up to us.

547
00:33:38.08 --> 00:33:42.88
And many of the time we came back with nothing and had to resupply ourselves because we

548
00:33:42.88 --> 00:33:48.28
got down to the last bullet many times.

549
00:33:48.28 --> 00:33:50.12
25, what was your load?

550
00:33:50.12 --> 00:33:52.000
Do you know how much you load out weight?

551
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Yes.

552
00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:01.92
My web gear with all the clips and everything in it and the water all that weighed 75 pounds.

553
00:34:01.92 --> 00:34:12.000
My Rutsack because I carried the radio, the PRC25, C4, Claymore, blasting caps, all everything

554
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.56
that you needed and extra antenna, all that stuff inside was another 75 pounds.

555
00:34:18.56 --> 00:34:19.72
I weighed 135.

556
00:34:19.72 --> 00:34:23.04
I carried 150 pounds in the field.

557
00:34:23.04 --> 00:34:27.72
Yeah, that's crazy.

558
00:34:27.72 --> 00:34:30.32
That's crazy.

559
00:34:30.32 --> 00:34:32.04
But that was everybody's load.

560
00:34:32.04 --> 00:34:34.000
The endage are mercenaries.

561
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
They carried probably 130 pounds.

562
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.28
They probably didn't weigh more than 120, 115.

563
00:34:42.28 --> 00:34:47.28
Please.

564
00:34:47.28 --> 00:34:48.44
Continuant on.

565
00:34:48.44 --> 00:34:53.40
The opportunity arrived on Thanksgiving Day, 1968.

566
00:34:53.40 --> 00:34:58.68
After the weather cleared at the Qua Tri, Montesite, Quang Tri.

567
00:34:58.68 --> 00:34:59.68
Is that right?

568
00:34:59.68 --> 00:35:00.68
Quang Tri.

569
00:35:00.68 --> 00:35:04.84
Quang Tri, Montesite, S.D. Virginia, board of the King Bees and headed west to the target area

570
00:35:04.84 --> 00:35:08.84
with three American and four South Vietnamese team members.

571
00:35:08.84 --> 00:35:14.28
LAP, the 17-year-old hardcore point man who had run many missions.

572
00:35:14.28 --> 00:35:15.28
Home?

573
00:35:15.28 --> 00:35:16.28
Is that right?

574
00:35:16.28 --> 00:35:17.28
Yes.

575
00:35:17.28 --> 00:35:23.16
Home, the interpreter, Chau, the M79 operator, and Khan Cowboy Donn, who had fought valiantly

576
00:35:23.16 --> 00:35:28.40
besides Lynn and Black Jr with ST Alabama.

577
00:35:28.40 --> 00:35:33.40
As the second Secourse Keychurned Westward, 135 pound paterno went through a mental checklist

578
00:35:33.40 --> 00:35:35.16
of everything he was carrying.

579
00:35:35.16 --> 00:35:43.88
Montgomery's car 15, the PRC-25 FM radio, an extra battery for it, a saw off M79 grenade

580
00:35:43.88 --> 00:35:49.36
launcher, a 22 caliber high standard pistol with a silencer, ammunition for all weapons,

581
00:35:49.36 --> 00:35:55.000
hand grenades, gas masks, smoke grenades, a camera, and five special bags of dehydrated

582
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
rice.

583
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.36
He quickly realized he was carrying more than 100 pounds a gear.

584
00:36:01.36 --> 00:36:05.24
His inner thoughts were jarred when the door gun or test fired is 30 caliber machine gun

585
00:36:05.24 --> 00:36:08.32
without announcing his intention to anyone.

586
00:36:08.32 --> 00:36:12.52
Within a matter of seconds the King Bees cut power and began to tight downward spiral into

587
00:36:12.52 --> 00:36:18.20
the LZ where children's, the lieutenant, hone and lap were already waiting.

588
00:36:18.20 --> 00:36:22.72
The dizzying downward spiral ended as the pilot rev the engine and landed on the LZ.

589
00:36:22.72 --> 00:36:28.28
Chau exited the H34 with the Cerno and Cowboy following him into the woodbine connecting

590
00:36:28.28 --> 00:36:30.36
with the remaining members of the team.

591
00:36:30.36 --> 00:36:36.36
The King Bees lifted off and the LZ quickly cleared the target area and then there was

592
00:36:36.36 --> 00:36:38.36
absolute silence.

593
00:36:38.36 --> 00:36:41.96
So there's your first mission insert right there.

594
00:36:41.96 --> 00:36:49.04
My first answer, you talked about having a pressure time.

595
00:36:49.04 --> 00:36:55.36
I'm not knowing what to have for doing but we just dropped out of the sky nowhere.

596
00:36:55.36 --> 00:37:04.76
I mean it was adrenaline rush but you know I've been rope and tigers and rhinos and

597
00:37:04.76 --> 00:37:10.80
I've been riding bulls and Bronx and you know it just it just came to me you know but

598
00:37:10.80 --> 00:37:18.64
but it was I mean I'm here all my training all that time over a year and I'm here.

599
00:37:18.64 --> 00:37:20.44
This is it.

600
00:37:20.44 --> 00:37:21.44
This is the day.

601
00:37:21.44 --> 00:37:27.20
Now you question whether you're going to stand up to it because you know the enemies

602
00:37:27.20 --> 00:37:28.40
there.

603
00:37:28.40 --> 00:37:30.20
We didn't go there because it wasn't.

604
00:37:30.20 --> 00:37:34.28
We went there because there was a trail that needed to be followed and find out who

605
00:37:34.28 --> 00:37:38.24
we've earned in that trail.

606
00:37:38.24 --> 00:37:45.32
The door gunner test fire in that 30 cal just is a good wake up call the last bit.

607
00:37:45.32 --> 00:37:52.84
I'm sitting in the door this right over my head and not only that our kingbees were so

608
00:37:52.84 --> 00:37:59.24
stripped that they were so light compared to that regular H34 marineships they could out

609
00:37:59.24 --> 00:38:04.64
fly them in height and we could get up and over into those mountains and those high ranges

610
00:38:04.64 --> 00:38:09.80
and stuff and but they dripped oil and they had oil going down your neck all the time

611
00:38:09.80 --> 00:38:14.44
you know and then when you shot that 30 cal over the top of the hot brass it hit me

612
00:38:14.44 --> 00:38:20.16
in the neck I'm going all the gravity you know scared to crap out of the almost jumped

613
00:38:20.16 --> 00:38:26.68
out and I landed.

614
00:38:26.68 --> 00:38:31.64
Back to the book the audio contrast was startling as the turnover sense is adjusted

615
00:38:31.64 --> 00:38:36.04
the quiet he scope out the LZ which was in a deep valley between three junkled covered

616
00:38:36.04 --> 00:38:41.44
mountains gradually sounds of the jungle resurfaced birds chirping bugs humming after

617
00:38:41.44 --> 00:38:47.72
ten minutes children signal the churno to radio cubby with the team okay the insertion

618
00:38:47.72 --> 00:38:51.84
was successful no enemy activity evident.

619
00:38:51.84 --> 00:38:55.72
Children's move the team toward the first mountain movement was slowed by tall elephant

620
00:38:55.72 --> 00:39:00.36
grass and the only communication between the team members was hand signals the team moved

621
00:39:00.36 --> 00:39:03.84
in ten minute intervals stopping every ten minutes to listen to what was going on around

622
00:39:03.84 --> 00:39:05.24
it.

623
00:39:05.24 --> 00:39:08.96
After more than an hour the team finally emerged from the elephant grass as it continued

624
00:39:08.96 --> 00:39:11.20
to climb the first mountain.

625
00:39:11.20 --> 00:39:15.60
Bruno was on hyper alert his heart pounding hard whether sitting in a long rest period

626
00:39:15.60 --> 00:39:20.20
or moving up the mountain near the top of the mountain lap pointed out an observation

627
00:39:20.20 --> 00:39:25.64
platform that had been cut to the jungle high off the ground from that platform anyone

628
00:39:25.64 --> 00:39:30.08
could observe the LZ and the valley where the team was inserted as well as the other

629
00:39:30.08 --> 00:39:33.92
open areas that could be used for landing helicopters.

630
00:39:33.92 --> 00:39:39.52
Had a trail watcher been sitting on the platform when S.T. Virginia flew into the LZ if so

631
00:39:39.52 --> 00:39:44.16
where was he headed and when with the NVA hit the team.

632
00:39:44.16 --> 00:39:48.36
Late in the day the team finally reached the top of the mountain and found a wide will

633
00:39:48.36 --> 00:39:49.96
use trail.

634
00:39:49.96 --> 00:39:54.36
Leterna's first thought was how could anyone be out here in the middle of this in the

635
00:39:54.36 --> 00:39:57.64
middle of nowhere in this thick jungle.

636
00:39:57.64 --> 00:40:01.16
Regardless the team set up its night perimeter far above the trail where it could see

637
00:40:01.16 --> 00:40:04.52
anyone moving while remaining camouflage and out of sight.

638
00:40:04.52 --> 00:40:09.32
At last light, children's made the final commo check with Kavi as the team settled in for

639
00:40:09.32 --> 00:40:11.20
its first night in the jungle.

640
00:40:11.20 --> 00:40:12.72
It was an unadventful night.

641
00:40:12.72 --> 00:40:16.28
Children's did a midnight commo check with Hillsboro the night command aircraft that flew

642
00:40:16.28 --> 00:40:22.92
high above the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the DMZ and checked in with Kavi in the early morning.

643
00:40:22.92 --> 00:40:26.44
After the team ate breakfast and shifts, children's directed lap to move parallel

644
00:40:26.44 --> 00:40:31.84
to the trail with cowboy as the tail gunner in the line of margin and Leterna walking

645
00:40:31.84 --> 00:40:33.16
in front of cowboy.

646
00:40:33.16 --> 00:40:37.36
The team moved slowly in less than 10 minute intervals before taking breaks to listen to

647
00:40:37.36 --> 00:40:38.96
the surrounding sounds.

648
00:40:38.96 --> 00:40:45.80
They did this because moving next to the trail was fraught within her at risks.

649
00:40:45.80 --> 00:40:48.16
So there's your first night out in the jungle.

650
00:40:48.16 --> 00:40:49.56
Yeah.

651
00:40:49.56 --> 00:40:51.28
Relatively mellow.

652
00:40:51.28 --> 00:40:52.28
It was.

653
00:40:52.28 --> 00:41:00.16
But the mosquitoes were huge and we wore crevats around our heads.

654
00:41:00.16 --> 00:41:06.52
We actually use those fraternicates as more as we could pull them down over our ears

655
00:41:06.52 --> 00:41:13.28
and face and pick the mosquitoes out the next day because they were like cranes.

656
00:41:13.28 --> 00:41:22.44
And I mean, then you have to realize too, that's the first meal for an entire day with

657
00:41:22.44 --> 00:41:32.80
100 degree weather and only one quart of water, a sip in the morning, a sip at noon,

658
00:41:32.80 --> 00:41:39.44
a little bit for the dehydrated rice at night and a sip to wash it down with and there's

659
00:41:39.44 --> 00:41:42.12
one quart gone for the day.

660
00:41:42.12 --> 00:41:47.76
It couldn't allow yourself to drink ever except on those intervals.

661
00:41:47.76 --> 00:41:51.20
And you didn't, did you guys plan to receply water?

662
00:41:51.20 --> 00:41:54.72
Did you guys look the maps and see rivers or anything?

663
00:41:54.72 --> 00:41:55.72
No.

664
00:41:55.72 --> 00:41:56.72
No.

665
00:41:56.72 --> 00:41:57.72
Nothing.

666
00:41:57.72 --> 00:41:58.52
So you plan to one quart a day?

667
00:41:58.52 --> 00:41:59.72
One quart a day.

668
00:41:59.72 --> 00:42:03.000
We think that is not healthy.

669
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.32
I know you're a trainer but that's what we had to allow ourselves because of the weight,

670
00:42:10.32 --> 00:42:13.72
you know, a gallon of water is 7.5.

671
00:42:13.72 --> 00:42:24.84
So we had to judge our weight versus ammunition and that's what we trained ourselves to do.

672
00:42:24.84 --> 00:42:31.60
And not only that, we also took pills so that we wouldn't go to the bathroom either because

673
00:42:31.60 --> 00:42:32.60
they could smell you.

674
00:42:32.60 --> 00:42:33.60
I'm smelling American.

675
00:42:33.60 --> 00:42:37.40
That's why we had to eat rice and eat everything they ate.

676
00:42:37.40 --> 00:42:38.72
Otherwise they'd smell you.

677
00:42:38.72 --> 00:42:43.28
They might have to smell them or I can't see rations all that stuff, they could smell that for

678
00:42:43.28 --> 00:42:48.96
miles and they had trackers out there and you had to watch for those which I think you'll

679
00:42:48.96 --> 00:42:50.76
get to.

680
00:42:50.76 --> 00:42:54.96
But just that water ration is what you had.

681
00:42:54.96 --> 00:42:57.24
I trained myself for a year to do that.

682
00:42:57.24 --> 00:43:01.16
I did that all the time because we figured we'd be out in the sixth day.

683
00:43:01.16 --> 00:43:05.60
We'd come out in the sixth day so we'd have no water on the last day but we could survive

684
00:43:05.60 --> 00:43:07.64
the five days.

685
00:43:07.64 --> 00:43:12.40
Do you ever take any heat casualties guys that went down from lack of water?

686
00:43:12.40 --> 00:43:13.40
Actually never did.

687
00:43:13.40 --> 00:43:14.40
That's amazing.

688
00:43:14.40 --> 00:43:15.40
Never did.

689
00:43:15.40 --> 00:43:17.20
In the desert, we would even train in guys.

690
00:43:17.20 --> 00:43:20.40
We'd have guys go down like on a two-day operation.

691
00:43:20.40 --> 00:43:23.32
I'd have guys go down from lack of water.

692
00:43:23.32 --> 00:43:29.08
I've had guys go down in training in the state side but I never had any.

693
00:43:29.08 --> 00:43:32.96
Our guys were, we were, I'm just gonna say we were talking.

694
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:35.40
Well, I jumped as little different than the desert too.

695
00:43:35.40 --> 00:43:36.40
Yeah.

696
00:43:36.40 --> 00:43:38.40
Because you're got shade.

697
00:43:38.40 --> 00:43:39.40
Yeah.

698
00:43:39.40 --> 00:43:40.40
Your triple canopy.

699
00:43:40.40 --> 00:43:44.40
So you actually are got shade over the top of you.

700
00:43:44.40 --> 00:43:45.40
You're not in open areas.

701
00:43:45.40 --> 00:43:46.40
You never go in an open area.

702
00:43:46.40 --> 00:43:52.48
You always follow the canopy but you have to move slowly because it's so darn thick.

703
00:43:52.48 --> 00:43:58.72
So it takes time and you have the tail gunners job is to cover the trail.

704
00:43:58.72 --> 00:43:59.72
Try to put.

705
00:43:59.72 --> 00:44:03.64
Everybody walks in everybody's footprint if you try.

706
00:44:03.64 --> 00:44:05.56
That's what you're supposed to do.

707
00:44:05.56 --> 00:44:08.80
Everybody has an area to cover.

708
00:44:08.80 --> 00:44:11.80
One guy turns to the right and the other guy turns to the left.

709
00:44:11.80 --> 00:44:14.16
The point man covers the 180 in front.

710
00:44:14.16 --> 00:44:18.60
The tail gunner cuts it to 180 in back and we train like that.

711
00:44:18.60 --> 00:44:21.84
We don't turn our backs and look at what the other guys doing.

712
00:44:21.84 --> 00:44:27.64
We only concentrate on our area and keep that area clean unless we have to move in that direction

713
00:44:27.64 --> 00:44:31.20
and we all turn that way and move.

714
00:44:31.20 --> 00:44:35.20
It's a precision movement that we practice.

715
00:44:35.20 --> 00:44:37.20
We train like that.

716
00:44:37.20 --> 00:44:42.40
Every time we were back in camp we train how to move.

717
00:44:42.40 --> 00:44:50.64
That's why arti Virginia and arti Idaho were survivalable teams besides having the luck

718
00:44:50.64 --> 00:44:53.84
of the gods with us.

719
00:44:53.84 --> 00:44:56.84
Sometimes you have to make your own luck a little bit through.

720
00:44:56.84 --> 00:44:57.96
We talked about that all the time.

721
00:44:57.96 --> 00:44:59.84
We would train all the time.

722
00:44:59.84 --> 00:45:02.84
We'd patrol around in the compound rehears, rehearse.

723
00:45:02.84 --> 00:45:03.84
We'd rehearse.

724
00:45:03.84 --> 00:45:07.44
We would rehearse in and out of the trucks.

725
00:45:07.44 --> 00:45:11.32
We'd have a big giant truck to transport troops.

726
00:45:11.32 --> 00:45:13.88
We do raids with those things.

727
00:45:13.88 --> 00:45:16.000
We'd practice getting out.

728
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.24
If this takes you seven seconds, if you're in a firefight, that means seven seconds.

729
00:45:21.24 --> 00:45:25.24
It's all long time to be trying to get out of a truck that people are launching grenades

730
00:45:25.24 --> 00:45:26.74
at.

731
00:45:26.74 --> 00:45:28.48
We'd practice so we could do it quickly.

732
00:45:28.48 --> 00:45:29.48
Do it at night.

733
00:45:29.48 --> 00:45:30.48
Do it in the dark.

734
00:45:30.48 --> 00:45:31.48
We'd rehearse.

735
00:45:31.48 --> 00:45:32.48
Reverse order.

736
00:45:32.48 --> 00:45:35.24
That's what we do so that we'd be ready.

737
00:45:35.24 --> 00:45:37.24
We did the same thing.

738
00:45:37.24 --> 00:45:40.60
We actually working out of F.O.B.4.

739
00:45:40.60 --> 00:45:48.08
We had a island called Monkey Mountain and we go over there and we set up a course to walk

740
00:45:48.08 --> 00:45:50.56
from one side to the other.

741
00:45:50.56 --> 00:45:58.96
That's how we would train so that we could continually upgrade how we walked.

742
00:45:58.96 --> 00:46:04.16
You guys didn't talk to tell about this. You guys didn't bring mosquito nets in the field

743
00:46:04.16 --> 00:46:05.60
to wear over your head.

744
00:46:05.60 --> 00:46:06.60
Never.

745
00:46:06.60 --> 00:46:09.88
That would be what we had was what they called.

746
00:46:09.88 --> 00:46:15.20
Believe it or not, they had mosquito repellent that was US Army issue.

747
00:46:15.20 --> 00:46:19.48
But we also had Max Factor that did the makeup.

748
00:46:19.48 --> 00:46:22.20
Okay, what's that all about?

749
00:46:22.20 --> 00:46:23.88
The grease paint.

750
00:46:23.88 --> 00:46:24.88
Camouflage paint.

751
00:46:24.88 --> 00:46:25.88
Oh, camouflage paint.

752
00:46:25.88 --> 00:46:26.88
Yeah, yeah.

753
00:46:26.88 --> 00:46:27.88
Yeah.

754
00:46:27.88 --> 00:46:35.52
What we would do is take the repellent and mix it in our palms, squirt into our palms

755
00:46:35.52 --> 00:46:40.44
and put the grease paint in our palms and then put the paint over our face or cover

756
00:46:40.44 --> 00:46:43.64
our highlights so there's no reflections.

757
00:46:43.64 --> 00:46:52.92
Besides that, I used electrical tape and wrapped up my trousers at the bottom around my

758
00:46:52.92 --> 00:46:53.92
boots.

759
00:46:53.92 --> 00:46:58.16
So to keep the leeches out, but also that closed off.

760
00:46:58.16 --> 00:47:02.04
And then I also did that around the wrists of my arms.

761
00:47:02.04 --> 00:47:07.92
And then we wore, our car 15s were so hot that we had to wear gloves with a few fingers

762
00:47:07.92 --> 00:47:08.92
cut out of them.

763
00:47:08.92 --> 00:47:10.92
We looked like Michael Jackson.

764
00:47:10.92 --> 00:47:13.16
Way before his time.

765
00:47:13.16 --> 00:47:17.16
And was she a toy and about that grease paint idea like that?

766
00:47:17.16 --> 00:47:18.16
Do you didn't know that?

767
00:47:18.16 --> 00:47:19.16
No, no, no.

768
00:47:19.16 --> 00:47:20.16
See, I'll turn something to another.

769
00:47:20.16 --> 00:47:21.16
There you go.

770
00:47:21.16 --> 00:47:22.16
Yeah.

771
00:47:22.16 --> 00:47:28.28
So the mosquito, the repellent and the grease paint mixed together made a very gooey

772
00:47:28.28 --> 00:47:33.28
mess, but it would keep them off of your face.

773
00:47:33.28 --> 00:47:36.84
And when you were at night, when they were at their worst, you could pull that crevette

774
00:47:36.84 --> 00:47:43.20
down and then keep them out of your ears and they would stay off your face because they

775
00:47:43.20 --> 00:47:44.64
didn't want anything to do with it.

776
00:47:44.64 --> 00:47:49.000
And we always carry just a little extra with us to keep it going because being out there

777
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
for five days.

778
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.44
And most of the time we get shot out in the day two days, three days.

779
00:47:58.44 --> 00:48:04.12
But I had the luck of having several five and seven day missions.

780
00:48:04.12 --> 00:48:09.96
I was able to stay out a long time as our teams progressed further and deeper.

781
00:48:09.96 --> 00:48:12.08
They didn't think we'd go that far.

782
00:48:12.08 --> 00:48:15.52
But we went deeper than anybody could ever go.

783
00:48:15.52 --> 00:48:22.84
We got down to some of our missions and the layoffs with one minute on time with the kingby.

784
00:48:22.84 --> 00:48:25.28
There was no bring-in to sound once they dropped us on the ground.

785
00:48:25.28 --> 00:48:26.76
It was over with.

786
00:48:26.76 --> 00:48:28.60
They had to go back and get fuel.

787
00:48:28.60 --> 00:48:30.28
So no ten minute station time.

788
00:48:30.28 --> 00:48:31.60
There's just dropped you left.

789
00:48:31.60 --> 00:48:32.60
I had to.

790
00:48:32.60 --> 00:48:33.60
I had to.

791
00:48:33.60 --> 00:48:36.16
But they weren't expecting us that far.

792
00:48:36.16 --> 00:48:38.08
We could get right into them.

793
00:48:38.08 --> 00:48:39.56
Catch them off guard.

794
00:48:39.56 --> 00:48:48.44
All right, going back to the book as S.T. Virginia moved up the second mountain, cowboy

795
00:48:48.44 --> 00:48:53.08
and L'Eternaux began to hear women's voices off the trail.

796
00:48:53.08 --> 00:48:55.44
Cowboy orge, the turnote to go explore the sound.

797
00:48:55.44 --> 00:48:56.44
Let's turnaux shook his head.

798
00:48:56.44 --> 00:48:58.88
No, indicating they had to stay with the team.

799
00:48:58.88 --> 00:49:02.44
Cowboy who spoke broken English repeated the suggestion.

800
00:49:02.44 --> 00:49:04.76
Adding it could be a small NVA village.

801
00:49:04.76 --> 00:49:09.52
We could kill everyone and make the NVA bow-coo angry.

802
00:49:09.52 --> 00:49:15.64
We want to let them know we can hurt them the same way they attack our camps and villages.

803
00:49:15.64 --> 00:49:20.68
Let's turnaux again declined and gave him the handsignal to plant some M14 antipers and

804
00:49:20.68 --> 00:49:23.04
now mines on the trail behind them.

805
00:49:23.04 --> 00:49:25.60
In case the NVA soldiers were trailing them.

806
00:49:25.60 --> 00:49:29.72
As the team moved on, L'Eternaux planted a few more tow poppers and marked their locations

807
00:49:29.72 --> 00:49:33.28
on his map for after covering them expertly.

808
00:49:33.28 --> 00:49:37.08
He laid down some powdered mustard gas on the ground for any tracker dogs that might

809
00:49:37.08 --> 00:49:38.40
follow their trail.

810
00:49:38.40 --> 00:49:41.44
The mustard gas was left over from World War I.

811
00:49:41.44 --> 00:49:44.44
How it landed at Fouby remained a mystery to L'Eternaux.

812
00:49:44.44 --> 00:49:47.16
The good news it was that it still worked.

813
00:49:47.16 --> 00:49:52.70
The fact that it was confirmed during the next break when the team heard a dog howling

814
00:49:52.70 --> 00:49:57.52
anguish after snorting some of the old mustard gas.

815
00:49:57.52 --> 00:50:02.000
Maybe it didn't work that well because a few minutes later, the dog was back on the

816
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.60
team's trail.

817
00:50:03.60 --> 00:50:06.44
Cowboy told the turnote to use his pistol to kill the dog.

818
00:50:06.44 --> 00:50:10.44
The turnote's mind flashback to special forces training group were instructors had said

819
00:50:10.44 --> 00:50:11.44
the same thing.

820
00:50:11.44 --> 00:50:17.12
The turnote pulled out the 22 quietly moved back down the trail, took off his rucksack and moved

821
00:50:17.12 --> 00:50:21.24
a few more feet before lying down on the ground facing the trail.

822
00:50:21.24 --> 00:50:24.24
The dog never realized the turnote was there.

823
00:50:24.24 --> 00:50:28.36
When the dog was about 10 feet away, the turnote fired one shot.

824
00:50:28.36 --> 00:50:31.28
It struck the dog between the eyes killing him instantly.

825
00:50:31.28 --> 00:50:35.12
The canine dropped in his tracks out of the turnote's view.

826
00:50:35.12 --> 00:50:38.64
On a wear of what had happened, the dog's hand, but removed up the trail.

827
00:50:38.64 --> 00:50:40.44
He got near the dead dog.

828
00:50:40.44 --> 00:50:42.88
When he got near the dead dog, he stepped on a tow-popper.

829
00:50:42.88 --> 00:50:46.28
The turnote and Cowboy heard the NVA screaming in pain and anguish.

830
00:50:46.28 --> 00:50:49.64
They left him behind figuring he would die shortly.

831
00:50:49.64 --> 00:50:53.84
The team moved further up the mountain with the turnote and Cowboy providing rear security.

832
00:50:53.84 --> 00:50:56.92
Again, the turnote and Cowboy heard women's voices below them.

833
00:50:56.92 --> 00:51:01.08
Again, Cowboy urged the turnote to go downhill in attacking the encampment and again,

834
00:51:01.08 --> 00:51:04.24
the turnote declined.

835
00:51:04.24 --> 00:51:06.64
That's so these guys are on you.

836
00:51:06.64 --> 00:51:13.96
Obviously at this point, when you guys are still heading up the mountain because you think

837
00:51:13.96 --> 00:51:17.16
you can get away from them and what is your point?

838
00:51:17.16 --> 00:51:20.16
What is your, what are you trying to accomplish at this point?

839
00:51:20.16 --> 00:51:22.84
At this point, we're trying to get away from the tracker.

840
00:51:22.84 --> 00:51:28.68
I've managed to take care of the tractor, but we don't know how many people are there.

841
00:51:28.68 --> 00:51:33.04
We keep hearing the voices of women's voices below us.

842
00:51:33.04 --> 00:51:37.20
Cowboy keeps wanting me to go down there with him, trying to confuse the whole situation

843
00:51:37.20 --> 00:51:40.92
because he wants to kill him because he says, it'll make him mad and they'll come after

844
00:51:40.92 --> 00:51:43.60
us and we can really get into it.

845
00:51:43.60 --> 00:51:49.44
Well, Cowboy just got off a mission on October 5th which is in the book where they decimated

846
00:51:49.44 --> 00:51:54.76
a 10,000 man division of all things.

847
00:51:54.76 --> 00:52:00.20
Eight and a half hours, they took down 85% of them with an eight-man team.

848
00:52:00.20 --> 00:52:01.36
Incredible.

849
00:52:01.36 --> 00:52:02.36
But it's true.

850
00:52:02.36 --> 00:52:07.32
They stack bodies up for sandbags.

851
00:52:07.32 --> 00:52:10.04
That's how many they were killing so fast.

852
00:52:10.04 --> 00:52:15.92
But he was insistent, but I totally can't do that because I can't split the team.

853
00:52:15.92 --> 00:52:18.12
I have to do it my one-zero says.

854
00:52:18.12 --> 00:52:20.56
I'm just a one-two.

855
00:52:20.56 --> 00:52:23.72
I'm low man on the tonal pole here, you know?

856
00:52:23.72 --> 00:52:27.48
There's even a lieutenant with us, but he's the one-one.

857
00:52:27.48 --> 00:52:32.32
He's actually below my sergeant because there's no rank in Song.

858
00:52:32.32 --> 00:52:38.32
That was one of the things that always took me back was there was no rank in Song.

859
00:52:38.32 --> 00:52:40.72
We didn't carry rank, we didn't wear rank.

860
00:52:40.72 --> 00:52:45.72
It was whoever was there, the longest that lived the longest was the 10th man.

861
00:52:45.72 --> 00:52:46.72
He's the one-zero.

862
00:52:46.72 --> 00:52:49.12
Whoever lived the longest was the one-zero.

863
00:52:49.12 --> 00:52:51.72
That's how it went down.

864
00:52:51.72 --> 00:52:55.20
That one-zero was killed, the one-one took over.

865
00:52:55.20 --> 00:52:59.76
You should take over the team from there on until he was killed.

866
00:52:59.76 --> 00:53:02.88
In the next one, the one-two would take over.

867
00:53:02.88 --> 00:53:05.24
He would cause he'd stepped up to the one-one position.

868
00:53:05.24 --> 00:53:13.28
That's how we progressed with our teams because everybody was killed as we went along.

869
00:53:13.28 --> 00:53:15.32
We were just lucky.

870
00:53:15.32 --> 00:53:18.88
But I did lose my one-zero, Guntherwald.

871
00:53:18.88 --> 00:53:26.32
And of course, children's went home and he was lost to an automobile accident.

872
00:53:26.32 --> 00:53:30.96
And so it's just, you know, but that's how it progressed.

873
00:53:30.96 --> 00:53:33.32
At this point, this is your first mission.

874
00:53:33.32 --> 00:53:38.12
It's like, I'm trying to do everything right.

875
00:53:38.12 --> 00:53:39.72
Yeah, and you're getting the full benefit.

876
00:53:39.72 --> 00:53:45.16
Like your first mission, you got the dog tracking you, you got the NVA encampment down below,

877
00:53:45.16 --> 00:53:48.88
you got the women's voices, you got the tracker coming up behind the dog.

878
00:53:48.88 --> 00:53:53.60
I mean, he's hitting the toe popper, this is like, and we know everything you were

879
00:53:53.60 --> 00:53:57.000
hoping for, here it is, here it is.

880
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.60
And we know the NVA's there, because the jungle is there.

881
00:54:00.60 --> 00:54:02.16
Because the families are there.

882
00:54:02.16 --> 00:54:08.32
So we know, of course we're thinking too, maybe they're the tracker's families too, you know,

883
00:54:08.32 --> 00:54:12.32
because they would hire trackers, they tell the trackers you either track for us will kill

884
00:54:12.32 --> 00:54:13.56
you.

885
00:54:13.56 --> 00:54:18.72
And so they have no choices, because they're just, and it ended out there, living, trying

886
00:54:18.72 --> 00:54:20.40
to survive.

887
00:54:20.40 --> 00:54:23.28
So you're trying to get up the mountain, get away from the tracker.

888
00:54:23.28 --> 00:54:24.96
Was it possible to shake the trackers?

889
00:54:24.96 --> 00:54:28.56
Was it possible to like actually lose them?

890
00:54:28.56 --> 00:54:29.56
Sometimes.

891
00:54:29.56 --> 00:54:30.56
Sometimes.

892
00:54:30.56 --> 00:54:34.76
Or did you feel like once the trackers were on you, you were pretty much heading to your

893
00:54:34.76 --> 00:54:35.76
extract.

894
00:54:35.76 --> 00:54:36.76
Exactly.

895
00:54:36.76 --> 00:54:42.40
Exactly, because they were communicating in some way a fashion and let the NVA know,

896
00:54:42.40 --> 00:54:43.40
we fought regular Jews.

897
00:54:43.40 --> 00:54:47.72
We never fought the Viet Cong that they called the VC.

898
00:54:47.72 --> 00:54:57.72
We actually fought uniformed NVA and the regular Army that North Vietnamese had.

899
00:54:57.72 --> 00:55:02.92
But we needed to get off of the keep off the trail and keep going, because we needed

900
00:55:02.92 --> 00:55:04.84
to find out where this trail was going.

901
00:55:04.84 --> 00:55:08.88
This was our mission to try to figure out where this trail went.

902
00:55:08.88 --> 00:55:14.20
We did accomplish it in the end because I went on a second mission, which is later in

903
00:55:14.20 --> 00:55:16.24
the book.

904
00:55:16.24 --> 00:55:24.36
And I found actually went into North Vietnam and was inserted on the Christmas of 68 in

905
00:55:24.36 --> 00:55:28.56
North Vietnam on the same trail, but higher up.

906
00:55:28.56 --> 00:55:31.76
And that's a whole different story there.

907
00:55:31.76 --> 00:55:37.000
But we're going back to this story.

908
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.24
Here we go.

909
00:55:38.24 --> 00:55:42.40
By the time the Terno completed his last radio called a cubby, the team was enveloped

910
00:55:42.40 --> 00:55:46.04
and darkness and team members began to set up a perimeter for the night.

911
00:55:46.04 --> 00:55:48.20
On broke without any enemy activity.

912
00:55:48.20 --> 00:55:51.96
When Covey flew over the team in the morning, he warned children that a team was being

913
00:55:51.96 --> 00:55:56.68
extrapted, extracted under heavy fire and another was being inserted into a top priority

914
00:55:56.68 --> 00:55:57.88
target.

915
00:55:57.88 --> 00:56:00.48
Sit tight was the last instruction from Covey.

916
00:56:00.48 --> 00:56:04.28
S.T. Virginia didn't move from its quiet spot alongside the mountain.

917
00:56:04.28 --> 00:56:08.88
During lunch hour, the member each member ate in shifts and L'Acherno went out to inspect

918
00:56:08.88 --> 00:56:09.88
the claim more minds.

919
00:56:09.88 --> 00:56:16.000
The team had deployed to ensure the NVA hadn't turned the deadly explosive devices around

920
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.84
to face toward them.

921
00:56:17.84 --> 00:56:21.52
When he completed his inspection, L'Acherno found a log to sit behind.

922
00:56:21.52 --> 00:56:23.000
The NVA would actually do that.

923
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.24
They'd crawl up to your perimeter and turn your claim to him.

924
00:56:25.24 --> 00:56:26.24
Triple canopy.

925
00:56:26.24 --> 00:56:30.08
You could pass them up within two feet of you.

926
00:56:30.08 --> 00:56:31.56
They could be two feet away from you.

927
00:56:31.56 --> 00:56:32.92
You wouldn't know it.

928
00:56:32.92 --> 00:56:35.12
That's how thick the jungle is.

929
00:56:35.12 --> 00:56:38.16
And you would see a foot.

930
00:56:38.16 --> 00:56:40.52
You'd say, come back.

931
00:56:40.52 --> 00:56:42.36
You might see a foot and you shoot the foot.

932
00:56:42.36 --> 00:56:45.52
If long as you shot the foot, you know he was down.

933
00:56:45.52 --> 00:56:48.36
He wouldn't go to supply dead in the hospitals.

934
00:56:48.36 --> 00:56:51.64
You know, you could count that as a kill.

935
00:56:51.64 --> 00:56:54.24
But you couldn't see.

936
00:56:54.24 --> 00:56:56.76
You just had to mow down the jungle.

937
00:56:56.76 --> 00:56:57.76
Open it up.

938
00:56:57.76 --> 00:56:59.84
Guess where they are at.

939
00:56:59.84 --> 00:57:02.16
The green trace is coming out.

940
00:57:02.16 --> 00:57:03.16
Give you a clue.

941
00:57:03.16 --> 00:57:04.16
Yeah.

942
00:57:04.16 --> 00:57:11.28
Yeah, it's just shocking to me that they would crawl up and turn around your claim more minds

943
00:57:11.28 --> 00:57:15.08
so that when you attack you, then you clock off your claim orders and boom, you're actually

944
00:57:15.08 --> 00:57:16.76
claim warning yourself.

945
00:57:16.76 --> 00:57:25.36
Later on, the CIA gave us a piece of equipment that I carried that had a little thread

946
00:57:25.36 --> 00:57:27.08
out of a box.

947
00:57:27.08 --> 00:57:33.84
You could wrap that whole thread around your encampment where you were A.O.A. is right at the

948
00:57:33.84 --> 00:57:38.96
moment and put it in your ear.

949
00:57:38.96 --> 00:57:45.28
If that thread was broke, it would sound a buzzing noise in your ear and you knew somebody

950
00:57:45.28 --> 00:57:46.28
came through.

951
00:57:46.28 --> 00:57:49.36
It could have been an animal but you knew somebody came through your perimeter and you

952
00:57:49.36 --> 00:57:52.48
just had to put it in front of all your claim orders.

953
00:57:52.48 --> 00:57:59.64
Then to stop it, you just let a batch and burnt it and you used the next day, the next

954
00:57:59.64 --> 00:58:00.64
type.

955
00:58:00.64 --> 00:58:08.44
But once I had that, my primators were always covered after that.

956
00:58:08.44 --> 00:58:12.42
Go back to the book later in the afternoon, children singled the team to pull in their

957
00:58:12.42 --> 00:58:14.96
claim or minds prepared to move out.

958
00:58:14.96 --> 00:58:19.68
Due to the combined weight of his rucksack and web gear, the terminal moved to his knees

959
00:58:19.68 --> 00:58:22.36
and slung his rucksack on his back.

960
00:58:22.36 --> 00:58:27.08
Just as it landed on his back, A.K. 47's open fire.

961
00:58:27.08 --> 00:58:29.76
Returnal was slammed to the ground, face first.

962
00:58:29.76 --> 00:58:33.80
The impact so severe he thought he had broken his nose, startled the terminal jumped up

963
00:58:33.80 --> 00:58:38.92
with his car 15 pointing toward the A.K. 47 gunfire that was near the front of the team.

964
00:58:38.92 --> 00:58:43.12
Surprised that there was no NVA near him, the terminal removed the rucksack to discover

965
00:58:43.12 --> 00:58:50.28
that 4 A.K. 47 rounds had ripped through the 23-pound PRC-25.

966
00:58:50.28 --> 00:58:55.98
He reached into an especially tailored pocket on his fatigue shirt, which was sewn with

967
00:58:55.98 --> 00:59:00.24
vertical zippers, one on the left side of the shirt and one on the right side between

968
00:59:00.24 --> 00:59:02.96
the top and bottom of the pockets of the shirt.

969
00:59:02.96 --> 00:59:09.04
He pulled out his URC-10 emergency radio and broadcast a general alert for any aircraft

970
00:59:09.04 --> 00:59:10.04
in the area.

971
00:59:10.04 --> 00:59:15.92
S.T. Virginia was declaring a Prairie Fire Emergency.

972
00:59:15.92 --> 00:59:18.08
This is your first fire from the enemy.

973
00:59:18.08 --> 00:59:21.76
He could shop in the radio for 4 rounds in the radio, knock you down.

974
00:59:21.76 --> 00:59:24.12
Yeah, I didn't know nothing.

975
00:59:24.12 --> 00:59:26.56
All I knew in my butt nose was busted.

976
00:59:26.56 --> 00:59:29.04
I thought it was anyway.

977
00:59:29.04 --> 00:59:35.48
Then I'm having to think what am I supposed to do and I was my first reaction.

978
00:59:35.48 --> 00:59:39.66
Meanwhile, my one zero-chilterist was mad as hell at me because he says, bring me that

979
00:59:39.66 --> 00:59:40.66
damn radio.

980
00:59:40.66 --> 00:59:44.000
He said, that hurt Tinnon could do crap for us.

981
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.96
He said, I said, any work and I think it's shot up and I said, don't work.

982
00:59:48.96 --> 00:59:50.52
There's no signal.

983
00:59:50.52 --> 00:59:52.96
So I brought it to him.

984
00:59:52.96 --> 00:59:59.10
Well, needless to say, I was standing up what I brought it to him and he's laying on the ground

985
00:59:59.10 --> 01:00:01.72
and he grabs me and he says, can't you just get down?

986
01:00:01.72 --> 01:00:04.72
Well, the AK-40 set of rounds are hitting all over us.

987
01:00:04.72 --> 01:00:06.52
We're in the middle of a firefight.

988
01:00:06.52 --> 01:00:08.32
Our work returned in fire.

989
01:00:08.32 --> 01:00:14.44
Me, I'm still standing there in shock and he pulls me to the ground, saves my life.

990
01:00:14.44 --> 01:00:20.04
And he says, he looks at the radio real quick and he goes, the antenna has been shot off.

991
01:00:20.04 --> 01:00:22.92
That was the fifth round that went through it.

992
01:00:22.92 --> 01:00:30.16
A breach between my Rutsack and my web gear and pulled out my spare antenna and screwed

993
01:00:30.16 --> 01:00:31.76
it on and we had Kamo.

994
01:00:31.76 --> 01:00:33.96
That made you a good to go.

995
01:00:33.96 --> 01:00:36.20
That's fair condition.

996
01:00:36.20 --> 01:00:47.84
And we were just then Pat Watkins's flying over our company writer and he says, what was

997
01:00:47.84 --> 01:00:51.84
going on and he could see it from where his location was in the air.

998
01:00:51.84 --> 01:00:57.04
And he could see we were taking massive amounts of fire and he called for an extraction

999
01:00:57.04 --> 01:01:01.40
from Kwong Tree and they brought the Kingby's in the Gittos.

1000
01:01:01.40 --> 01:01:03.16
We had to, you know, you can read the...

1001
01:01:03.16 --> 01:01:09.72
Yeah, yeah, the once he got that, once he got the radio back for you to start working,

1002
01:01:09.72 --> 01:01:13.56
children screams into the radio, we need an ex-filled now, I'm declaring Perry Fire Emergency

1003
01:01:13.56 --> 01:01:14.80
is anyone out there.

1004
01:01:14.80 --> 01:01:18.28
Within a second or two, there was a response, calm down, children's, I realized you're

1005
01:01:18.28 --> 01:01:21.12
under fire set a COVID writer.

1006
01:01:21.12 --> 01:01:25.48
Just at that moment, several AK47s opened up from the woodline near the log where LaTorno

1007
01:01:25.48 --> 01:01:30.48
had been unsehermoneously slammed onto his face, lap and cowboy returned fire.

1008
01:01:30.48 --> 01:01:34.48
Kovie writer continued, we heard your team declare a Prairie Fire Emergency on the

1009
01:01:34.48 --> 01:01:37.24
Guard frequency and I've rallied the cavalry.

1010
01:01:37.24 --> 01:01:38.24
What's your mark?

1011
01:01:38.24 --> 01:01:39.68
Do you have an LZ inside?

1012
01:01:39.68 --> 01:01:44.48
Before children set a word in the radio, he turned to LaTorno and said, see, it works.

1013
01:01:44.48 --> 01:01:46.84
Suppose we have left it for the NVA.

1014
01:01:46.84 --> 01:01:47.84
Never.

1015
01:01:47.84 --> 01:01:50.36
I say never, ever, leave a radio behind.

1016
01:01:50.36 --> 01:01:55.08
Because if to emphasize that point, the NVA opened fire again as a lap took, as that began

1017
01:01:55.08 --> 01:01:58.76
looking for an LZ while moving the team down the hill away from the most concentrated

1018
01:01:58.76 --> 01:02:00.48
NVA gunfire.

1019
01:02:00.48 --> 01:02:05.04
Cutting LaTorno no slack, children's road, tell Kovie will give him a fix in five minutes.

1020
01:02:05.04 --> 01:02:06.84
We'll probably need strings to get out of here.

1021
01:02:06.84 --> 01:02:11.48
I doubt we can make it into the valley where a king be, king be, can pick us up.

1022
01:02:11.48 --> 01:02:15.80
Without missing a beat, LaTorno who for the first time felt four burning stings in his

1023
01:02:15.80 --> 01:02:22.04
back, repeated those words to Kovie while he and Kovie began providing cover fire as the

1024
01:02:22.04 --> 01:02:24.20
tail element of the team.

1025
01:02:24.20 --> 01:02:28.60
Then, LaTorno nodded to Kovie who ignited several clay more mines at the team and set

1026
01:02:28.60 --> 01:02:29.60
out on his perimeter.

1027
01:02:29.60 --> 01:02:33.28
Those mines only sold the NVA for a few seconds.

1028
01:02:33.28 --> 01:02:37.48
Before the dust and debris from the blast settled, the NVA soldiers were moving through

1029
01:02:37.48 --> 01:02:39.68
it toward Kovie and LaTorno.

1030
01:02:39.68 --> 01:02:43.40
Without saying a word, the two men took turns firing at the enemy while moving down

1031
01:02:43.40 --> 01:02:44.80
the hill.

1032
01:02:44.80 --> 01:02:46.80
They were waiting around each other.

1033
01:02:46.80 --> 01:02:49.96
Cowboy would fire several bursts from his car 15 and then reload.

1034
01:02:49.96 --> 01:02:55.16
As he reloaded, LaTorno would open fire, providing cover, covering fire for the team.

1035
01:02:55.16 --> 01:02:57.48
The classic cover and move scenario.

1036
01:02:57.48 --> 01:02:58.48
Yes.

1037
01:02:58.48 --> 01:02:59.48
Just the way we drill it.

1038
01:02:59.48 --> 01:03:00.48
That's right.

1039
01:03:00.48 --> 01:03:01.48
Oh yeah.

1040
01:03:01.48 --> 01:03:05.08
And it just came natural.

1041
01:03:05.08 --> 01:03:08.88
Believe it or not, it just came natural.

1042
01:03:08.88 --> 01:03:10.88
What part of it just came natural?

1043
01:03:10.88 --> 01:03:11.88
Just load and fire.

1044
01:03:11.88 --> 01:03:12.88
Load and fire.

1045
01:03:12.88 --> 01:03:16.12
And move, load and fire, move, load and fire.

1046
01:03:16.12 --> 01:03:20.60
We had to get the team came together.

1047
01:03:20.60 --> 01:03:27.02
Our fire power, you can only imagine what a full team of fire power with all car 15s and

1048
01:03:27.02 --> 01:03:30.28
M79s and clay more mines going off.

1049
01:03:30.28 --> 01:03:32.52
They knew they had a battle.

1050
01:03:32.52 --> 01:03:34.80
But they were overpowering us.

1051
01:03:34.80 --> 01:03:35.80
Yeah.

1052
01:03:35.80 --> 01:03:41.88
I talked about this with tilt as well, like the determination of them where you think of

1053
01:03:41.88 --> 01:03:46.92
the insurgents, insurgent army, you know, their rule is like, hey, we don't need to fight.

1054
01:03:46.92 --> 01:03:48.12
We don't need to win this fire fight.

1055
01:03:48.12 --> 01:03:50.44
We don't need to win this battle because we're going to be here for a long time.

1056
01:03:50.44 --> 01:03:51.44
We can wait.

1057
01:03:51.44 --> 01:03:53.12
We will fight when we want to fight.

1058
01:03:53.12 --> 01:03:57.84
And it's the way that they attacked you guys and LaT took so many losses but continued

1059
01:03:57.84 --> 01:04:01.96
to press and continue to press like their fighting spirit was high.

1060
01:04:01.96 --> 01:04:06.48
Well, let me give you a backdrop on that.

1061
01:04:06.48 --> 01:04:09.40
Maybe tilt hasn't even got to that.

1062
01:04:09.40 --> 01:04:15.36
Most of the wars over with in history starts evolving in the books and people start asking

1063
01:04:15.36 --> 01:04:16.64
questions.

1064
01:04:16.64 --> 01:04:23.12
We find out that they've got 40,000 troops hunting us down, hunting sagers down.

1065
01:04:23.12 --> 01:04:26.04
And there's a huge bounty on us.

1066
01:04:26.04 --> 01:04:32.32
We heard 100,000, $200,000 to kill an American on a song team.

1067
01:04:32.32 --> 01:04:35.04
And they had a kill an American award.

1068
01:04:35.04 --> 01:04:36.20
They killed somebody.

1069
01:04:36.20 --> 01:04:42.12
They got the award and the bonus and they were instant heroes and Hanoi forever.

1070
01:04:42.12 --> 01:04:45.44
It meant everything to them to kill us.

1071
01:04:45.44 --> 01:04:53.36
And they put 40,000 troops designated that we had tied up because they wanted to kill

1072
01:04:53.36 --> 01:04:58.52
us because we did so much damage to go ahead.

1073
01:04:58.52 --> 01:05:01.16
Yeah.

1074
01:05:01.16 --> 01:05:06.12
Be kind of damaged during one short long cowboy again planned to claim more mine in the

1075
01:05:06.12 --> 01:05:10.40
direction of the advancing NVA in Laterno dug out another claim or from his rucksack in place

1076
01:05:10.40 --> 01:05:12.60
to 10 second delay fusing it.

1077
01:05:12.60 --> 01:05:17.76
When the NVA again advanced cowboy ignited his clayborn mind, claim more mind.

1078
01:05:17.76 --> 01:05:22.52
When the NVA moved again toward the team, Laterno ignited his fusing ran down the hill with

1079
01:05:22.52 --> 01:05:26.20
cowboy to catch up to their team before they reach the team.

1080
01:05:26.20 --> 01:05:30.88
To be 40 anti-personnel rockets slammed into the trees above them, showering them with

1081
01:05:30.88 --> 01:05:31.88
a trap.

1082
01:05:31.88 --> 01:05:36.60
A few more exploded as Laterno and cowboy moved down the hill.

1083
01:05:36.60 --> 01:05:40.28
The 10 second, then the 10 second fusing ignited another claim more.

1084
01:05:40.28 --> 01:05:45.84
It brought precious time for the gun and run team of Laterno and cowboy to cover ground

1085
01:05:45.84 --> 01:05:49.24
and catch up with a remainder of ST Virginia.

1086
01:05:49.24 --> 01:05:53.80
What you guys drill, pull and out those claymores with the 10 second fusing, hook them up

1087
01:05:53.80 --> 01:05:54.80
and set them up.

1088
01:05:54.80 --> 01:05:57.44
I mean, it takes like a little bit of time to do that.

1089
01:05:57.44 --> 01:06:00.56
Did you guys have a pre-wrigged where you could just stick them in the ground?

1090
01:06:00.56 --> 01:06:02.56
How did you guys do that?

1091
01:06:02.56 --> 01:06:03.72
We did.

1092
01:06:03.72 --> 01:06:06.12
We had a pre-wrigged.

1093
01:06:06.12 --> 01:06:08.52
Everybody says, we can't have your blasting caps with you.

1094
01:06:08.52 --> 01:06:10.12
You're just, they've hit the blast casters.

1095
01:06:10.12 --> 01:06:12.12
You're going to blow you to smithereens.

1096
01:06:12.12 --> 01:06:14.72
Yeah, but those precious seconds would mean.

1097
01:06:14.72 --> 01:06:18.08
I had mine in my red sack pre-wrigged.

1098
01:06:18.08 --> 01:06:19.08
There you go.

1099
01:06:19.08 --> 01:06:23.28
Yeah, and with us with Baba had his pre-cut, so we had to fire second, 10 second, and

1100
01:06:23.28 --> 01:06:24.28
then longer.

1101
01:06:24.28 --> 01:06:29.52
And then you had to actually clock her itself with the full standard cord that you could blow

1102
01:06:29.52 --> 01:06:30.84
it, it would give you more distance.

1103
01:06:30.84 --> 01:06:31.84
How long was that cord?

1104
01:06:31.84 --> 01:06:32.84
50 feet.

1105
01:06:32.84 --> 01:06:33.84
50 feet.

1106
01:06:33.84 --> 01:06:37.44
So you could put this claymore down on the tree and pull back and then you hit it,

1107
01:06:37.44 --> 01:06:38.44
the handheld.

1108
01:06:38.44 --> 01:06:39.44
Yeah.

1109
01:06:39.44 --> 01:06:42.08
The portalized we did, and that one mission we were using the five seconds to

1110
01:06:42.08 --> 01:06:43.08
Bubba put in.

1111
01:06:43.08 --> 01:06:44.08
Yeah.

1112
01:06:44.08 --> 01:06:45.80
But they were pre-cut and had them ready to go.

1113
01:06:45.80 --> 01:06:48.68
So you just put the fusing pull it and stick it in the ground.

1114
01:06:48.68 --> 01:06:51.80
Yeah, the little stakes, the standard, the black for things.

1115
01:06:51.80 --> 01:06:54.04
Yeah, boom, jamming in the ground and you're good.

1116
01:06:54.04 --> 01:06:55.04
Yeah.

1117
01:06:55.04 --> 01:06:56.68
So you're setting those things up in like 10 seconds.

1118
01:06:56.68 --> 01:06:59.12
Of course you always had to make sure they were pulling it the right way.

1119
01:06:59.12 --> 01:07:01.16
That's indeed.

1120
01:07:01.16 --> 01:07:02.40
Point towards the enemy.

1121
01:07:02.40 --> 01:07:03.36
Front towards enemy.

1122
01:07:03.36 --> 01:07:05.000
Yeah.

1123
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:05.56
Weed the back.

1124
01:07:09.20 --> 01:07:10.000
Continue on us.

1125
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.36
She'll just call the an air strikes.

1126
01:07:11.36 --> 01:07:14.24
Let's turn over, flagged it on how surreal this firefight had been.

1127
01:07:14.24 --> 01:07:18.08
It wasn't like anything he'd witnessed on television or in any movie.

1128
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:21.08
Instead of men charging each other and killing each other in plain sight,

1129
01:07:21.08 --> 01:07:26.04
here in triple canopy jungle, he observed green tracers from AK 47's first

1130
01:07:26.04 --> 01:07:28.80
or at the most an enemy hand or foot.

1131
01:07:28.80 --> 01:07:33.12
And somehow the NVA found firing lanes where they could launch shoulder held

1132
01:07:33.12 --> 01:07:37.28
B40 anti-personnel rockets that slammed above and around them as they

1133
01:07:37.28 --> 01:07:40.32
raised down the hill for their lives.

1134
01:07:40.32 --> 01:07:44.44
Again, the voices of the special forces and structures echoed in his mind.

1135
01:07:44.44 --> 01:07:49.04
They had told the young aspiring green berets at Fort Bragg that the NVA was a

1136
01:07:49.04 --> 01:07:51.84
tough resilient opponent.

1137
01:07:51.84 --> 01:07:55.72
Many had fought against the Japanese during World War II and against the French

1138
01:07:55.72 --> 01:08:01.88
driving them from Vietnam in 1954 after the Battle of Dan B. N.Q. in North Vietnam.

1139
01:08:01.88 --> 01:08:05.64
The sounds of King Bees in the distance and the crashing thunder of B40 rocket

1140
01:08:05.64 --> 01:08:09.84
slamming into trees above his head shook L'Aterno out of his moment of introspection

1141
01:08:09.84 --> 01:08:14.72
and turned his undivided attention to a crescendo of AK 47 fire from the enemy.

1142
01:08:14.72 --> 01:08:19.44
S.T. Virginia responded with volley after volley of full and semi-automatic gunfire

1143
01:08:19.44 --> 01:08:26.88
while the Terno and Chau fired several M79 rounds toward the dense section of the jungle where the AK 47

1144
01:08:26.88 --> 01:08:30.24
gunfire was emanating.

1145
01:08:30.24 --> 01:08:33.68
Through the gunfire someone popped a smoke grenade which brought the King Bees closer to

1146
01:08:33.68 --> 01:08:36.12
our T. Virginia's location in the jungle.

1147
01:08:36.12 --> 01:08:40.52
Over the Dan of Gunfire, children's encalboy told everyone to put their Swiss seats on

1148
01:08:40.52 --> 01:08:42.96
and prepare for an extraction.

1149
01:08:42.96 --> 01:08:47.88
In short order, a King Bees was hovering over S.T. Virginia more than 125 feet above the

1150
01:08:47.88 --> 01:08:48.88
jungle floor.

1151
01:08:48.88 --> 01:08:54.64
L'Aterno cowboy Chau in home hulked their de-rings into the old Maguire rigged that hung

1152
01:08:54.64 --> 01:09:00.32
from the end of the ropes and shortly were being lifted out of the jungle.

1153
01:09:00.32 --> 01:09:05.88
As the quartet of recon men was being lifted into the air, the NV only envied at least

1154
01:09:05.88 --> 01:09:10.64
another salvo of AK 47 gunfire and several B40 rockets.

1155
01:09:10.64 --> 01:09:15.12
Shrapnel from the rockets hit them with varying degrees of size and velocity all of

1156
01:09:15.12 --> 01:09:17.12
them were wounded.

1157
01:09:17.12 --> 01:09:21.64
During those explosions that L'Aterno realized as Car 15 and somehow caught in a rope above

1158
01:09:21.64 --> 01:09:24.20
him, just far enough a way that he couldn't reach it.

1159
01:09:24.20 --> 01:09:28.80
He pulled out his M79 and launched a 40 millimeter grenade toward the NVA positions.

1160
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:34.28
Now all he could see of the enemy were hundreds of muzzle blasts from AK 47's and green

1161
01:09:34.28 --> 01:09:36.12
tracers.

1162
01:09:36.12 --> 01:09:41.84
Green tracer rounds eerily climbing toward the quartet of S.T. Virginia men.

1163
01:09:41.84 --> 01:09:46.56
Before he could reload his M79, the King Bees began to move away from the target area,

1164
01:09:46.56 --> 01:09:49.84
surprising him because the men had not yet cleared the jungle.

1165
01:09:49.84 --> 01:09:53.40
Instead of continuing to climb out of the target, moving straight up until the men

1166
01:09:53.40 --> 01:09:57.52
cleared the jungle's triple canopy of trees and vegetation, the King Bees was moving away

1167
01:09:57.52 --> 01:10:00.68
from the target area due to heavy enemy ground fire.

1168
01:10:00.68 --> 01:10:04.32
In recent months at least two King Bees were shot down during string extractions from

1169
01:10:04.32 --> 01:10:08.88
hot targets, but these facts were unknown to L'Aterno at the time.

1170
01:10:08.88 --> 01:10:13.56
Shrapnel from the B40 rockets exploded around S.T. Virginia men, stinging them with

1171
01:10:13.56 --> 01:10:16.96
bits of hot metal, further spooking the King Bees crew.

1172
01:10:16.96 --> 01:10:21.40
L'Aterno began to violently collide with tall jungle trees, feeling like a metal ball

1173
01:10:21.40 --> 01:10:23.04
in a pinball machine.

1174
01:10:23.04 --> 01:10:29.08
L'Aterno caroomed off several more trees as at least one more B40 exploded in the

1175
01:10:29.08 --> 01:10:32.48
treetops, again shouring him with trappin'al.

1176
01:10:32.48 --> 01:10:36.72
A tree branch hit L'Aterno from the side and turned him upside down in his rope Swiss

1177
01:10:36.72 --> 01:10:37.72
seat.

1178
01:10:37.72 --> 01:10:42.28
As the rope began to slip down from his hips, L'Aterno remembered spider telling him how

1179
01:10:42.28 --> 01:10:47.40
one zero from another team had recently been shot out of his Swiss seat during a rope extraction.

1180
01:10:47.40 --> 01:10:52.04
Another tree struck L'Aterno before he was able to muster a surge of strength and momentum

1181
01:10:52.04 --> 01:10:58.16
to reach up and grab the rope above him as his body finally cleared the treetop.

1182
01:10:58.16 --> 01:11:03.92
The only thing between him and certain death below on the jungle floor 200 feet down

1183
01:11:03.92 --> 01:11:11.92
was the single piece of rope tied into the King Bees.

1184
01:11:11.92 --> 01:11:14.92
Just another day in salt.

1185
01:11:14.92 --> 01:11:16.92
Just another day in salt, huh?

1186
01:11:16.92 --> 01:11:23.44
And I had 13 of those like that.

1187
01:11:23.44 --> 01:11:30.12
How did you guys when you're getting hit with all that and you're shooting back hanging

1188
01:11:30.12 --> 01:11:31.72
from a string?

1189
01:11:31.72 --> 01:11:38.12
I mean, that's just like completely insane that no one died on that rope on that extraction.

1190
01:11:38.12 --> 01:11:42.56
And you're also spinning.

1191
01:11:42.56 --> 01:11:44.44
Just the rotation of the mountain top, you get knocked around.

1192
01:11:44.44 --> 01:11:49.96
The strings just spinning and the air is flowing past you and you're having, you know,

1193
01:11:49.96 --> 01:11:54.20
you're just trying everything you do to stick with it.

1194
01:11:54.20 --> 01:11:57.56
But that was my first mission.

1195
01:11:57.56 --> 01:12:06.08
Later on, I've finally realized that I didn't have an extra deering on my webgare to strap

1196
01:12:06.08 --> 01:12:07.08
in.

1197
01:12:07.08 --> 01:12:09.08
I was falling over backwards.

1198
01:12:09.08 --> 01:12:11.08
I did that twice.

1199
01:12:11.08 --> 01:12:19.08
Then I finally found out from my good buddy here until I was doing it wrong.

1200
01:12:19.08 --> 01:12:27.40
Because after my second mission, children said left, but he had not given me that information

1201
01:12:27.40 --> 01:12:29.48
out of all of our training.

1202
01:12:29.48 --> 01:12:31.76
Had not thought about it.

1203
01:12:31.76 --> 01:12:38.76
He was extracted on another jumper.

1204
01:12:38.76 --> 01:12:41.76
It's unbelievable.

1205
01:12:41.76 --> 01:12:44.32
When I read these things, I just can't.

1206
01:12:44.32 --> 01:12:50.08
It's just hard to even fathom the mayhem when you're talking about just all these B40 rockets,

1207
01:12:50.08 --> 01:12:52.08
which is basically like an RPG.

1208
01:12:52.08 --> 01:12:53.08
Exactly.

1209
01:12:53.08 --> 01:12:57.08
An older RPG.

1210
01:12:57.08 --> 01:12:59.36
It's crazy.

1211
01:12:59.36 --> 01:13:03.28
So I'm back to the book with one final urgent poll that Turner was able to move himself

1212
01:13:03.28 --> 01:13:07.08
upright in the Swiss seat as the king be continued to climb higher into the sky.

1213
01:13:07.08 --> 01:13:12.88
Distancing itself from the fear of exploding B40 and AK-47 gunfire while gaining air

1214
01:13:12.88 --> 01:13:13.88
speed.

1215
01:13:13.88 --> 01:13:17.92
As the king be ascended, the heavily sweating, L'Ecturnal clung to the rope as another

1216
01:13:17.92 --> 01:13:22.08
sensation overwhelmed his body, chattering teeth.

1217
01:13:22.08 --> 01:13:26.64
Within a matter of minutes, the king be had climbed to an altitude of more than 5,000 feet

1218
01:13:26.64 --> 01:13:30.44
with the air is thinner and much colder than on the jungle floor.

1219
01:13:30.44 --> 01:13:35.44
So much colder that LaTernos body began shaking violently from the dipping temperatures

1220
01:13:35.44 --> 01:13:39.36
as the king be continued to climb into the safety of higher altitude.

1221
01:13:39.36 --> 01:13:43.40
In ordinary circumstances, few people would ever think about freezing to death over Southeast

1222
01:13:43.40 --> 01:13:48.000
Asia, but for the men in CNC was just another hurdle they had to clear.

1223
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.80
As the king be headed east, the final looked down on the spots in the jungle that appeared

1224
01:13:51.80 --> 01:13:55.48
to be good LZs thinking, why don't you lay in there?

1225
01:13:55.48 --> 01:14:00.52
What ST Virginia's collective agony continued until the king be finally landed in South Vietnam.

1226
01:14:00.52 --> 01:14:05.88
By that time, every member of ST Virginia had their circulation cut off to their legs.

1227
01:14:05.88 --> 01:14:07.64
They couldn't stand or walk.

1228
01:14:07.64 --> 01:14:11.92
All they could do is unhook from their Swiss seat, grab their stuff, and try and get the circulation

1229
01:14:11.92 --> 01:14:17.12
going again in their legs while the door gunner helped them to get back to the king be.

1230
01:14:17.12 --> 01:14:22.56
When the team returned to Quang Tree, Quang Tree.

1231
01:14:22.56 --> 01:14:27.08
The launch site before heading south to Foo Bay, children's pulled the Ternos side and told

1232
01:14:27.08 --> 01:14:29.000
them, take good care of that radio.

1233
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.16
You're going to take it on the next mission, whether you like it or not.

1234
01:14:32.16 --> 01:14:34.80
We're going to make you bring this shot up radio?

1235
01:14:34.80 --> 01:14:36.000
Yeah, we did.

1236
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.16
We did.

1237
01:14:37.16 --> 01:14:40.08
It saved his life till it's life in the end.

1238
01:14:40.08 --> 01:14:41.52
How's that?

1239
01:14:41.52 --> 01:14:42.52
That Christmas day mission?

1240
01:14:42.52 --> 01:14:44.44
Okay, we had the Intel Report.

1241
01:14:44.44 --> 01:14:45.76
Was that the same radio?

1242
01:14:45.76 --> 01:14:47.76
You brought a shot up radio in the field?

1243
01:14:47.76 --> 01:14:48.76
He did.

1244
01:14:48.76 --> 01:14:49.76
Not me.

1245
01:14:49.76 --> 01:14:53.56
I got a hundred miles skip out of it.

1246
01:14:53.56 --> 01:14:57.92
That's ridiculous.

1247
01:14:57.92 --> 01:15:02.80
As darkness fell, the king be lifted off from Quang Tree for Foo Bay.

1248
01:15:02.80 --> 01:15:09.26
When the old warboards landed on FoB1 landing zone, S.T. Virginia was greeted by one man,

1249
01:15:09.26 --> 01:15:13.28
former S.T. Virginia, 10 John McGovern.

1250
01:15:13.28 --> 01:15:17.64
He greeted each of the team members as they exited the kingbees, asking each one, are

1251
01:15:17.64 --> 01:15:18.64
you okay?

1252
01:15:18.64 --> 01:15:25.08
After the kingbees departed, bathing them in sand, dust, and LZ debris kicked up by the prop

1253
01:15:25.08 --> 01:15:29.16
wash, McGovern asked children, did you hear about beta?

1254
01:15:29.16 --> 01:15:30.96
A tall.

1255
01:15:30.96 --> 01:15:33.08
Children's Shirk has had no what happened.

1256
01:15:33.08 --> 01:15:37.16
November 13th, we lost a kingbee with seven SF troops on it.

1257
01:15:37.16 --> 01:15:39.84
We lost the entire kingbee crew.

1258
01:15:39.84 --> 01:15:44.64
They were a bunch of strap hangers who volunteered to pull an elder son mission on the trail,

1259
01:15:44.64 --> 01:15:48.16
but an anti-aircraft round hit the kingbee and route to the target.

1260
01:15:48.16 --> 01:15:52.72
They exploded in midair, they never had a chance.

1261
01:15:52.72 --> 01:15:57.68
In silence, McGovern drove the tired dirty and hungry team back to the team room.

1262
01:15:57.68 --> 01:16:00.88
As the Viet to Meese team members climbed off the truck, McGovern turned to L'Aternal

1263
01:16:00.88 --> 01:16:04.04
and said, you know what was really scary about that mission?

1264
01:16:04.04 --> 01:16:09.76
The day before they got shot down, me, limb black, Rick Howard, John Peters, Tim Schaff,

1265
01:16:09.76 --> 01:16:15.16
and a few others had volunteered and were actually on the kingbees suited up ready to go,

1266
01:16:15.16 --> 01:16:21.16
only to be canceled last minute by Bad Whiskey Xray, which is a weather in the AO that was

1267
01:16:21.16 --> 01:16:23.44
too close for comfort.

1268
01:16:23.44 --> 01:16:27.84
After a long pause, pause, he asked the Terno, how did it go out there?

1269
01:16:27.84 --> 01:16:32.88
I heard you were good on the radio, you didn't get rattled, you ain't a cheery no more,

1270
01:16:32.88 --> 01:16:39.56
you've joined a small unique club of SF men, CNC recon men who went across the fence.

1271
01:16:39.56 --> 01:16:44.000
It was nothing like I ever could have imagined the Terno responded, looking toward the

1272
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.04
Viet to Meese team members he added, let me get some child for the endage, you will

1273
01:16:48.04 --> 01:16:54.44
write about them, they have ice in their veins, I'm beat, I'll see you in the morning.

1274
01:16:54.44 --> 01:16:58.28
L'Aternal walked through the white sand to the mess hall, picked up some fresh sandwiches

1275
01:16:58.28 --> 01:17:00.28
and cold sodas for the team.

1276
01:17:00.28 --> 01:17:04.20
After lingering with the Viet to Meese team members, L'Aternal returned to his room, finally

1277
01:17:04.20 --> 01:17:06.96
taking off his rucksack and web gear.

1278
01:17:06.96 --> 01:17:12.04
As he started to undress, L'Aternal became aware of pain and his back, where from where

1279
01:17:12.04 --> 01:17:17.80
the 4 AK-47 rounds had slammed him face first into the ground, first he peeled off his jungle

1280
01:17:17.80 --> 01:17:21.64
fatigue shirt and was amazed to find four bullet holes in it.

1281
01:17:21.64 --> 01:17:25.60
Then he took off his undershirt, dido, four bullet holes run it.

1282
01:17:25.60 --> 01:17:31.88
L'Aternal picked up his rucksack, four bullet holes run it, both in the front and the back.

1283
01:17:31.88 --> 01:17:35.64
Something he hadn't realized during the firefight, then he looked in the mirror and saw

1284
01:17:35.64 --> 01:17:41.52
four large welts and broken skin up his spine where the AK-47 rounds had hit his body

1285
01:17:41.52 --> 01:17:45.52
after punching through his rucksack and the PRC-25.

1286
01:17:45.52 --> 01:17:50.60
Only then dido, L'Aternal began to comprehend just how lucky he had been hours earlier

1287
01:17:50.60 --> 01:17:55.60
in the day when the NVA shot him in the back four times.

1288
01:17:55.60 --> 01:18:00.68
L'Aternal began to cut away the black electrical tape around his socks which he pulled

1289
01:18:00.68 --> 01:18:03.72
up over his pant legs to keep about leeches and bugs.

1290
01:18:03.72 --> 01:18:05.60
Then he made a startling discovery.

1291
01:18:05.60 --> 01:18:10.88
When he pulled his pant leg from the sock and pulled off his right boot, four AK-47 bullets

1292
01:18:10.88 --> 01:18:12.92
fell on the ground.

1293
01:18:12.92 --> 01:18:16.72
In the heat of the battle, the Frenchman didn't realize that after he was shot in the

1294
01:18:16.72 --> 01:18:25.08
back the four 7.62 millimeter NVA rounds had fallen through his pants and his socks into

1295
01:18:25.08 --> 01:18:26.56
his right boot.

1296
01:18:26.56 --> 01:18:30.44
He stood in utter amazement staring at the four rounds on the floor before picking them

1297
01:18:30.44 --> 01:18:34.32
up and throwing them in the sand outside his room.

1298
01:18:34.32 --> 01:18:39.52
Exhausted, L'Aternal walked over to the shower room, the water stung, the wounds in his

1299
01:18:39.52 --> 01:18:45.52
back, amazingly the four bullets had enough energy to penetrate his skin, wounding him, but

1300
01:18:45.52 --> 01:18:48.40
not enough to get under his skin.

1301
01:18:48.40 --> 01:18:52.92
Two tired to treat the four bullet wounds in his back and trap the wounds in his arm.

1302
01:18:52.92 --> 01:19:00.92
L'Aternal finished his shower and went to bed.

1303
01:19:00.92 --> 01:19:05.64
So that was mission number one.

1304
01:19:05.64 --> 01:19:14.12
There's a saying that we came to realize later on that everybody just looked at you and

1305
01:19:14.12 --> 01:19:19.36
say, well that's just another day and so on.

1306
01:19:19.36 --> 01:19:25.72
My first mission, I had to run 12 more before it was done.

1307
01:19:25.72 --> 01:19:29.84
And when you got done with it, I mean, you talked to the other guys and they were telling

1308
01:19:29.84 --> 01:19:31.88
you, hey, yeah, that's how it is.

1309
01:19:31.88 --> 01:19:37.32
Yes, that's how it is. He couldn't go into the bar and go, yeah, this is what I did.

1310
01:19:37.32 --> 01:19:40.76
He just said, yeah, I got back.

1311
01:19:40.76 --> 01:19:42.64
Well, and don't forget the footnote on that.

1312
01:19:42.64 --> 01:19:46.04
Could like about what four or five days later, the medics?

1313
01:19:46.04 --> 01:19:49.96
Yeah, tongue-butt the wounds from the strapple.

1314
01:19:49.96 --> 01:19:56.32
Of course, I had to ignore everything because otherwise they don't think I was, you know,

1315
01:19:56.32 --> 01:19:58.32
just a wipper.

1316
01:19:58.32 --> 01:20:04.04
So I just had to suck it up, not saying nothing.

1317
01:20:04.04 --> 01:20:08.000
But all of a sudden, I started getting these boils on me.

1318
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.52
They were huge.

1319
01:20:09.52 --> 01:20:15.76
So I went to the medic and what's his name again?

1320
01:20:15.76 --> 01:20:21.76
Magio, the medio says, well, you got strapple in your body.

1321
01:20:21.76 --> 01:20:23.40
That's all, that's all swollen.

1322
01:20:23.40 --> 01:20:24.40
It's infecting you.

1323
01:20:24.40 --> 01:20:28.80
He says, you're going to have that for quite a while to wait and get every piece out of you.

1324
01:20:28.80 --> 01:20:32.84
He says, I don't know how many holes you got, but this one here needs attention right now

1325
01:20:32.84 --> 01:20:34.64
and it's huge.

1326
01:20:34.64 --> 01:20:38.08
And it was my arm and forearm, actually.

1327
01:20:38.08 --> 01:20:45.12
And he looked at the other medic, shipping and said, holding down and he looked at me and

1328
01:20:45.12 --> 01:20:48.04
said, don't you look at what I'm doing?

1329
01:20:48.04 --> 01:20:50.16
Don't you turn your head?

1330
01:20:50.16 --> 01:20:52.92
He said, because otherwise you're going to pass out on me.

1331
01:20:52.92 --> 01:20:56.48
When you see what I'm going to do, he said, so don't you look?

1332
01:20:56.48 --> 01:20:58.48
And you're going to hold the management.

1333
01:20:58.48 --> 01:21:01.68
You hold them down and don't look or you're going to pass out.

1334
01:21:01.68 --> 01:21:07.56
Well, what he was doing was taking a big stick swab in hydrogen peroxide and burning a

1335
01:21:07.56 --> 01:21:13.44
hole right through the boil and then he took four steps and he pulled the strings out

1336
01:21:13.44 --> 01:21:17.92
with the shrattin' along the end from the B40 rockets because they're all made in China.

1337
01:21:17.92 --> 01:21:20.16
They're chycombs, you know?

1338
01:21:20.16 --> 01:21:23.48
And so they had a lot of string, that's how they wrapped them.

1339
01:21:23.48 --> 01:21:26.40
They didn't mold them in the metal like we did.

1340
01:21:26.40 --> 01:21:29.60
And so anyway, I kept having to go.

1341
01:21:29.60 --> 01:21:34.28
And then another day I had to go any, I'd do the back of my head and I had a couple of

1342
01:21:34.28 --> 01:21:39.08
my head and then I had a couple of my back and another under my arm and I walked around

1343
01:21:39.08 --> 01:21:41.92
with bandages until I went out of my next mission.

1344
01:21:41.92 --> 01:21:48.36
I got to tell you, I witnessed one of those get pulled out and it was gross.

1345
01:21:48.36 --> 01:21:50.60
What were you doing, just wanted to get, you know, stuck?

1346
01:21:50.60 --> 01:21:51.60
He had pulled several hours.

1347
01:21:51.60 --> 01:21:52.60
We kept hearing about these things.

1348
01:21:52.60 --> 01:21:53.60
Let me show you.

1349
01:21:53.60 --> 01:21:54.60
Oh, thanks.

1350
01:21:54.60 --> 01:21:55.60
Talk about TMI.

1351
01:21:55.60 --> 01:21:56.60
Talk about pus.

1352
01:21:56.60 --> 01:22:02.60
You're gonna go back in the field anyways.

1353
01:22:02.60 --> 01:22:03.60
Yeah.

1354
01:22:03.60 --> 01:22:04.84
It was like, hey, it doesn't matter.

1355
01:22:04.84 --> 01:22:06.64
We'll do what we can right now.

1356
01:22:06.64 --> 01:22:07.64
Yeah.

1357
01:22:07.64 --> 01:22:08.64
Exactly.

1358
01:22:08.64 --> 01:22:09.64
Exactly.

1359
01:22:09.64 --> 01:22:13.56
Because we had another mission lined out for Christmas of 68.

1360
01:22:13.56 --> 01:22:18.72
So what was the optempo like meeting how often would you, when you did you did your

1361
01:22:18.72 --> 01:22:21.32
13 missions, how long did that take?

1362
01:22:21.32 --> 01:22:23.60
What time span was that over when the one year or two?

1363
01:22:23.60 --> 01:22:24.60
One year tour.

1364
01:22:24.60 --> 01:22:28.24
I had 13 missions and one bright light.

1365
01:22:28.24 --> 01:22:32.20
And someday we'll talk about the bright light, I guess.

1366
01:22:32.20 --> 01:22:33.20
Why not today?

1367
01:22:33.20 --> 01:22:43.36
Well, that is a, it's not written in the books because of what it ended up being.

1368
01:22:43.36 --> 01:22:49.16
But a bright light in the song is a volunteer situation where a team of volunteers to go

1369
01:22:49.16 --> 01:22:53.20
in and get another team out that can't get out.

1370
01:22:53.20 --> 01:22:57.36
And we had a lot of those or to try to find a team that disappeared.

1371
01:22:57.36 --> 01:22:59.08
We had a lot of teams disappear.

1372
01:22:59.08 --> 01:23:02.92
I, our TI-to-ho, Lane and Owens completely disappeared.

1373
01:23:02.92 --> 01:23:04.96
They've never been found to this day.

1374
01:23:04.96 --> 01:23:06.08
No trace.

1375
01:23:06.08 --> 01:23:08.000
Just completely off the bat.

1376
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.04
People have gone into this day and hunt.

1377
01:23:10.04 --> 01:23:13.32
The government hunts today and can't find them.

1378
01:23:13.32 --> 01:23:15.32
And they're under good circumstances.

1379
01:23:15.32 --> 01:23:17.16
Are these the guys that you took over for?

1380
01:23:17.16 --> 01:23:18.16
Yes.

1381
01:23:18.16 --> 01:23:19.16
Yes.

1382
01:23:19.16 --> 01:23:25.24
And so when I got on the Idahoans transferred from Virginia to Idaho because

1383
01:23:25.24 --> 01:23:31.44
till it went home and I became Lynne Blacks-1-1.

1384
01:23:31.44 --> 01:23:36.76
One day he had been gone for a while up at headquarters and I always protected him because

1385
01:23:36.76 --> 01:23:37.76
I'm the one one.

1386
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:40.32
I protected my one zeros.

1387
01:23:40.32 --> 01:23:46.70
I had to know where they were doing all the time because you just never knew because we had

1388
01:23:46.70 --> 01:23:53.92
we had nung's, we had cambo's, we had mountain yards, we had Vietnamese in our camp.

1389
01:23:53.92 --> 01:23:55.88
They all fought amongst themselves.

1390
01:23:55.88 --> 01:23:58.24
They're alone wondering if they're the enemy.

1391
01:23:58.24 --> 01:24:05.24
And we also had an entire team of NVA, two hoys, two hoys being they gave up.

1392
01:24:05.24 --> 01:24:10.88
And that was Team Cobra and they were there for a very special mission that they went

1393
01:24:10.88 --> 01:24:17.72
on and to get US prisoners out of a camp that was located.

1394
01:24:17.72 --> 01:24:23.08
But we got a call, Lynne went up to their headquarters and had been a little while.

1395
01:24:23.08 --> 01:24:24.84
So I went up there to see what was going on.

1396
01:24:24.84 --> 01:24:30.56
He's walking back down and says, can we go on a bright light?

1397
01:24:30.56 --> 01:24:33.000
I said, we're ready, we're packed.

1398
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.76
Because that's just what you did.

1399
01:24:34.76 --> 01:24:35.76
You were asked, you went.

1400
01:24:35.76 --> 01:24:43.40
He said, we got two pilots down and we think they're alive.

1401
01:24:43.40 --> 01:24:45.28
We got to go in.

1402
01:24:45.28 --> 01:24:51.56
They brought a jolly green giant in for us, which is very unusual air force.

1403
01:24:51.56 --> 01:24:54.72
I don't know where they really took us.

1404
01:24:54.72 --> 01:24:59.32
At this point in time in my life, we still don't know.

1405
01:24:59.32 --> 01:25:03.96
They have all kinds of records, but it's very confusing of where we went.

1406
01:25:03.96 --> 01:25:10.74
The week came in and that jolly, when we circled over the top of the plane, it was all

1407
01:25:10.74 --> 01:25:11.74
intact.

1408
01:25:11.74 --> 01:25:15.80
It was just sitting there in elephant grass.

1409
01:25:15.80 --> 01:25:18.76
No one could figure out why.

1410
01:25:18.76 --> 01:25:22.48
So they brought us down and I jumped out.

1411
01:25:22.48 --> 01:25:31.76
But when I jumped out, there was a slight lift in the plane and the jolly green and it just

1412
01:25:31.76 --> 01:25:36.80
came down, back down on me, about crushed me and then it came back up and then ling jumped

1413
01:25:36.80 --> 01:25:38.64
out and my guys jumped out.

1414
01:25:38.64 --> 01:25:40.36
In each of it, it was an old two.

1415
01:25:40.36 --> 01:25:44.12
It was a push pull, seshna, engine in the front and engine in the back.

1416
01:25:44.12 --> 01:25:46.28
That's where it had been shot down.

1417
01:25:46.28 --> 01:25:47.28
We think it was shot down.

1418
01:25:47.28 --> 01:25:48.28
We don't.

1419
01:25:48.28 --> 01:25:49.28
Or crashed, how ever?

1420
01:25:49.28 --> 01:25:51.60
We just don't know how it happened.

1421
01:25:51.60 --> 01:25:59.08
But what the real deal was is the plane, whatever happened to it was making an emergency

1422
01:25:59.08 --> 01:26:06.64
landing and it saw this opening like an LZ and thought this would be a good place to at

1423
01:26:06.64 --> 01:26:10.60
least start the landing even if it went into the jungle.

1424
01:26:10.60 --> 01:26:12.36
It would slow it down.

1425
01:26:12.36 --> 01:26:17.40
Problem was, as soon as they hit the ground, there was a bowl and they hit the front of

1426
01:26:17.40 --> 01:26:20.52
the bowl with the front engine and stopped dead.

1427
01:26:20.52 --> 01:26:21.52
Like a bird?

1428
01:26:21.52 --> 01:26:23.52
It was a bird.

1429
01:26:23.52 --> 01:26:30.80
It stopped dead but it bent the engine around to the right and the right seat was sucked

1430
01:26:30.80 --> 01:26:37.88
up into the carburetors into the Lycoe engine and he was in the fins and he just had his

1431
01:26:37.88 --> 01:26:39.88
head and his arms sticking out.

1432
01:26:39.88 --> 01:26:45.28
When I got there on that side, it said 10 minutes after 10 in the morning.

1433
01:26:45.28 --> 01:26:47.16
His Rolex watch was cracked.

1434
01:26:47.16 --> 01:26:51.76
The bezel was cracked and it stopped the watch at 10 after 10.

1435
01:26:51.76 --> 01:26:55.64
And we didn't get there till about 230.

1436
01:26:55.64 --> 01:26:58.52
And don't forget when the chopper's going down, you're out of fire.

1437
01:26:58.52 --> 01:27:02.44
Yeah, and we're getting some small arms fire.

1438
01:27:02.44 --> 01:27:10.68
And Lin goes to the pilot side on the left side and he looked fine but we realized the

1439
01:27:10.68 --> 01:27:15.96
Yoke had crushed his chest and killed him in place but it also had him trapped and we

1440
01:27:15.96 --> 01:27:18.96
couldn't get either one out.

1441
01:27:18.96 --> 01:27:21.92
But at that point in time, that was a trap.

1442
01:27:21.92 --> 01:27:31.20
They had set the Johnny Green back off and we started taking tremendous amount of fire.

1443
01:27:31.20 --> 01:27:37.48
And I looked across the inside of the cabin at Lin and then looked back at me and I said

1444
01:27:37.48 --> 01:27:43.04
I love your brother or not getting out of this and he said no we're not.

1445
01:27:43.04 --> 01:27:44.68
This is it.

1446
01:27:44.68 --> 01:27:54.52
And I looked up and radioed the Jolly Green to come back in and he shook his head.

1447
01:27:54.52 --> 01:27:56.72
I could see him playing his day.

1448
01:27:56.72 --> 01:27:57.72
He shook his head.

1449
01:27:57.72 --> 01:27:59.96
I don't think I can come back.

1450
01:27:59.96 --> 01:28:04.28
I said you better because I got an M79 point in it at you.

1451
01:28:04.28 --> 01:28:06.72
I'll take you down with us.

1452
01:28:06.72 --> 01:28:09.12
He moved up forward.

1453
01:28:09.12 --> 01:28:12.20
By that time there was 200 NBA surrounding us.

1454
01:28:12.20 --> 01:28:17.48
We're giving it everything they got and we managed crawling into that chopper because

1455
01:28:17.48 --> 01:28:24.000
if we got up on the wings and he scooped us up and I had already called in tech here because

1456
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.92
they already had tech here ready.

1457
01:28:26.92 --> 01:28:35.32
And as we lifted off and got up about 50 feet and A1 sped flew right underneath us between

1458
01:28:35.32 --> 01:28:39.80
the plane and the chopper.

1459
01:28:39.80 --> 01:28:46.80
Like he looked up at me like this and was smiling and he dropped the WP right on top of

1460
01:28:46.80 --> 01:28:55.08
them and there was crispy critters running everywhere and we got out of there and got back

1461
01:28:55.08 --> 01:29:05.76
and we walked down landed us back at FB4 and we walked down the road back to our hooch

1462
01:29:05.76 --> 01:29:10.24
and we just looked at each other and said another day and so on.

1463
01:29:10.24 --> 01:29:11.80
And all the time they were on the ground.

1464
01:29:11.80 --> 01:29:14.08
They were under fire going in.

1465
01:29:14.08 --> 01:29:19.84
They put a perimeter around the aircraft while Lynn and Doug went in to try to establish

1466
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:25.44
what the status of the pilots wore and the firefight was intense.

1467
01:29:25.44 --> 01:29:31.28
I remember when I got back, Doug had just left and I came back to know at the end of October

1468
01:29:31.28 --> 01:29:37.40
69 that I bright laid was fresh on Lynn's mind and we talked about it and I talked

1469
01:29:37.40 --> 01:29:43.32
to him later about that bright laid and he was crazy because he had salty went and

1470
01:29:43.32 --> 01:29:49.68
went forward and did from RT Idaho and that team and Lynn was like, man, I don't even

1471
01:29:49.68 --> 01:29:51.80
know how we got out of there.

1472
01:29:51.80 --> 01:29:56.52
So I was one of those real, just a really tight one but like Doug says in a way when you

1473
01:29:56.52 --> 01:30:03.52
know, and retrospect like, I just another day in the sag but that wouldn't really stuck.

1474
01:30:03.52 --> 01:30:12.48
Yeah, I just thought that out of all my missions and if you read the book and were tilt

1475
01:30:12.48 --> 01:30:19.04
honors me with a few missions in his books between across the fence and on the ground,

1476
01:30:19.04 --> 01:30:25.28
that when there was, as his tenses had gotten, we thought it was over physically and mentally,

1477
01:30:25.28 --> 01:30:28.16
we gave up, we thought it was over.

1478
01:30:28.16 --> 01:30:31.92
That we weren't going to get up out of that mess and get into that chopper.

1479
01:30:31.92 --> 01:30:36.56
Then before he rockets were hitting that plate underneath that jolly green, we were going

1480
01:30:36.56 --> 01:30:40.76
up in the air faster than the chopper could get us up in the air from the pounding we

1481
01:30:40.76 --> 01:30:41.76
were taking.

1482
01:30:41.76 --> 01:30:44.76
They had been for that spad, we might not have.

1483
01:30:44.76 --> 01:30:47.84
To this day we can't find the spad pilot.

1484
01:30:47.84 --> 01:30:51.96
We have reunions we go to, the spad and reunions but we still can't be able to find that

1485
01:30:51.96 --> 01:30:53.60
spad pilot that did that day.

1486
01:30:53.60 --> 01:30:57.80
Because what he says is like when the jolly green is pulling out the beef 40 pounded underneath

1487
01:30:57.80 --> 01:31:00.72
and the armor playing could sustain it.

1488
01:31:00.72 --> 01:31:04.52
But it would give the chopper a jolt like Liv Blackhead on October 5th and this would

1489
01:31:04.52 --> 01:31:09.24
they were experiencing again one October, year later, same thing.

1490
01:31:09.24 --> 01:31:10.84
Yeah, exactly.

1491
01:31:10.84 --> 01:31:15.32
I'm surprised that they take those beef 40 strikes like that.

1492
01:31:15.32 --> 01:31:20.28
I mean, one lucky shot that hits the tail rotor or something and it's just game over.

1493
01:31:20.28 --> 01:31:21.28
Sure.

1494
01:31:21.28 --> 01:31:25.92
When we get back on missions we would walk around our Kingbees and count how many bullet

1495
01:31:25.92 --> 01:31:29.64
holes and how many were in the blades.

1496
01:31:29.64 --> 01:31:35.36
We could there's clean shots through the blades and then we we'd caught 40, 50, 80 rounds

1497
01:31:35.36 --> 01:31:43.36
in our Kingbees when we come back and pieces of metal gone that they had to put tin over.

1498
01:31:43.36 --> 01:31:44.36
They used beer cans.

1499
01:31:44.36 --> 01:31:45.36
Yeah.

1500
01:31:45.36 --> 01:31:46.84
A loona beer cans.

1501
01:31:46.84 --> 01:31:47.84
Yeah.

1502
01:31:47.84 --> 01:31:56.40
And what about the, what about that operation where you, we had to go and get the 55 gallon

1503
01:31:56.40 --> 01:32:00.52
drum of and pull that one over?

1504
01:32:00.52 --> 01:32:01.52
Yeah.

1505
01:32:01.52 --> 01:32:02.52
Okay.

1506
01:32:02.52 --> 01:32:05.88
We'll go through that.

1507
01:32:05.88 --> 01:32:09.48
Somebody would probably like to read it in the book but we'll kind of go through that.

1508
01:32:09.48 --> 01:32:11.72
We were trained.

1509
01:32:11.72 --> 01:32:15.72
We had a CIA agent come in and trainers.

1510
01:32:15.72 --> 01:32:22.52
For a brand new explosive detonator that was a time device that was shaped on the top

1511
01:32:22.52 --> 01:32:27.40
in of a bung of a 55 gallon drum.

1512
01:32:27.40 --> 01:32:31.20
As curls you put a wrench on it and unscrew it.

1513
01:32:31.20 --> 01:32:34.04
You've seen them.

1514
01:32:34.04 --> 01:32:35.20
And we said, this is by way.

1515
01:32:35.20 --> 01:32:37.88
This is a seal type mission so you really appreciate this.

1516
01:32:37.88 --> 01:32:39.04
So this is absolutely yeah.

1517
01:32:39.04 --> 01:32:41.04
When I read about it, it's, I was like, hmm.

1518
01:32:41.04 --> 01:32:43.24
It's a good seal mission.

1519
01:32:43.24 --> 01:32:45.24
But a well.

1520
01:32:45.24 --> 01:32:49.28
Well, they didn't let the seals do that in those days.

1521
01:32:49.28 --> 01:32:52.16
No, they're busy on the coast.

1522
01:32:52.16 --> 01:32:53.32
Yeah, they're busy on the coast.

1523
01:32:53.32 --> 01:32:54.32
They really were.

1524
01:32:54.32 --> 01:32:57.32
We, I mean, everything up to that is in a jungle.

1525
01:32:57.32 --> 01:32:58.92
I'll see you get to the riverboat.

1526
01:32:58.92 --> 01:32:59.92
Exactly.

1527
01:32:59.92 --> 01:33:07.92
But we actually went into secret lockup, couldn't talk to anybody.

1528
01:33:07.92 --> 01:33:12.52
Nobody could come in and talk to us and we went through these exercises and training.

1529
01:33:12.52 --> 01:33:22.000
We actually loaded up for it and they took us out to the, and took us to a concrete

1530
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.84
and we launched out of there and went into layoffs into this huge river that they had.

1531
01:33:28.84 --> 01:33:30.88
But we had to stay away from it.

1532
01:33:30.88 --> 01:33:35.88
We had to actually hike in for two days to get to it.

1533
01:33:35.88 --> 01:33:42.32
And when we got there and down the hill and to the river, it was night on the second

1534
01:33:42.32 --> 01:33:44.64
end of the second day.

1535
01:33:44.64 --> 01:33:49.000
And then Gunther was my one zero and I was as one one.

1536
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.56
There was no one one two.

1537
01:33:51.56 --> 01:33:56.04
And he was an X Marine.

1538
01:33:56.04 --> 01:33:58.08
And he was an E6.

1539
01:33:58.08 --> 01:34:00.64
And he was my one zero.

1540
01:34:00.64 --> 01:34:02.84
He'd been around a while.

1541
01:34:02.84 --> 01:34:06.40
And he says, okay, go in and get that drum.

1542
01:34:06.40 --> 01:34:08.88
And I said, well, you're the Marine.

1543
01:34:08.88 --> 01:34:09.88
You're Navy.

1544
01:34:09.88 --> 01:34:11.44
Why should I go in again?

1545
01:34:11.44 --> 01:34:14.28
I'm just going to do the one.

1546
01:34:14.28 --> 01:34:16.48
You're the one one.

1547
01:34:16.48 --> 01:34:18.92
You're a PFC.

1548
01:34:18.92 --> 01:34:20.12
And I'm an E6.

1549
01:34:20.12 --> 01:34:21.80
So that's how it's going down.

1550
01:34:21.80 --> 01:34:28.24
And don't forget before you get there, they hike through jungle for two days and two nights.

1551
01:34:28.24 --> 01:34:29.48
To meet the CIA.

1552
01:34:29.48 --> 01:34:31.48
I forgot that.

1553
01:34:31.48 --> 01:34:34.48
Who gave them specialized charters.

1554
01:34:34.48 --> 01:34:36.60
He come from.

1555
01:34:36.60 --> 01:34:39.04
He had Chinese with him.

1556
01:34:39.04 --> 01:34:44.64
And he said, I will meet you out there to give you this device because I can't trust anybody

1557
01:34:44.64 --> 01:34:48.88
to have this device in case you're caught between now and then.

1558
01:34:48.88 --> 01:34:51.92
And I said, there's no way we're going to find you out there.

1559
01:34:51.92 --> 01:34:53.28
This impossible.

1560
01:34:53.28 --> 01:34:55.000
He says, don't you worry about it.

1561
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.28
You get to this coordinate.

1562
01:34:56.28 --> 01:34:59.28
And I will find you.

1563
01:34:59.28 --> 01:35:00.28
That's impressive.

1564
01:35:00.28 --> 01:35:01.88
And he did.

1565
01:35:01.88 --> 01:35:02.88
We got to that coordinate.

1566
01:35:02.88 --> 01:35:03.88
We waited.

1567
01:35:03.88 --> 01:35:04.88
And we waited.

1568
01:35:04.88 --> 01:35:06.04
And next thing we know, he come right out of the jungle.

1569
01:35:06.04 --> 01:35:08.000
And there he was.

1570
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.28
We were going to kill him with our ZNBA.

1571
01:35:10.28 --> 01:35:11.28
Yeah, of course.

1572
01:35:11.28 --> 01:35:12.28
Chinese with him.

1573
01:35:12.28 --> 01:35:13.28
Oh.

1574
01:35:13.28 --> 01:35:17.84
So Zola Nockless was his name.

1575
01:35:17.84 --> 01:35:21.52
If you're a pronounce it right, I probably can't pronounce it right.

1576
01:35:21.52 --> 01:35:22.84
Commerce spelling.

1577
01:35:22.84 --> 01:35:25.12
It was.

1578
01:35:25.12 --> 01:35:28.64
He actually was a renegade CIA agent.

1579
01:35:28.64 --> 01:35:35.40
He was a desktoyaki that wanted to prove that he could be an infield agent as the story

1580
01:35:35.40 --> 01:35:40.40
finally went that we didn't learn about this until what about 12 years ago.

1581
01:35:40.40 --> 01:35:41.40
Yeah.

1582
01:35:41.40 --> 01:35:44.24
And we did you meet him later?

1583
01:35:44.24 --> 01:35:45.24
No, no, no.

1584
01:35:45.24 --> 01:35:46.24
No, no.

1585
01:35:46.24 --> 01:35:47.24
We don't want to know where he went.

1586
01:35:47.24 --> 01:35:48.72
What happened to him?

1587
01:35:48.72 --> 01:35:50.24
We met another CIA guy.

1588
01:35:50.24 --> 01:35:59.68
We needed that was actually a counterpart to a Russian KGB agent that when they

1589
01:35:59.68 --> 01:36:05.12
were in the Russian, finally admitted and declassified the Vietnam War.

1590
01:36:05.12 --> 01:36:11.80
And admitted they had 3,000 Russians helping the NVA.

1591
01:36:11.80 --> 01:36:13.52
And they had a reunion.

1592
01:36:13.52 --> 01:36:19.64
And they did an actual video of the reunion admitting that they had worked with the NVA

1593
01:36:19.64 --> 01:36:27.08
and the Chinese in helping the NVA go up and down the whole chain of betrayal.

1594
01:36:27.08 --> 01:36:36.04
Well, this Zolunakus had figured this out and got a halt of this device.

1595
01:36:36.04 --> 01:36:46.28
And how we learned about it was this CIA agent had gone there and helped declassify

1596
01:36:46.28 --> 01:36:53.32
all the records of special ops stuff that was they were they had located.

1597
01:36:53.32 --> 01:37:00.56
They hold here they found my name in the KGB at Files in Moscow twice, my code name

1598
01:37:00.56 --> 01:37:06.20
and my real name and the missions that I ran.

1599
01:37:06.20 --> 01:37:15.60
They did that twice and they found Lin because we bumped into what we thought was a Mexican,

1600
01:37:15.60 --> 01:37:20.64
Spanish speaking person, speaking broken English and I'm from California, right?

1601
01:37:20.64 --> 01:37:29.76
And I go back to my old days and I told Lin I said this guy's Mexican got to be.

1602
01:37:29.76 --> 01:37:31.96
What the hell's he doing out here?

1603
01:37:31.96 --> 01:37:33.68
And he's talking to us on the radio.

1604
01:37:33.68 --> 01:37:37.48
He's got our frequency and Lin says, give me that phone.

1605
01:37:37.48 --> 01:37:42.68
So he goes back and forth with him and he says, you got to move out of the area.

1606
01:37:42.68 --> 01:37:44.20
He says, I'm not going to move out of the area.

1607
01:37:44.20 --> 01:37:45.20
I'm here to stay.

1608
01:37:45.20 --> 01:37:46.20
Here's my coordinate.

1609
01:37:46.20 --> 01:37:47.96
He said, get in a five digit coordinate.

1610
01:37:47.96 --> 01:37:51.48
But no, what do you get to do? He says, well, not there, but you need to move out of

1611
01:37:51.48 --> 01:37:52.48
the right.

1612
01:37:52.48 --> 01:37:55.28
He was trying to save our butts because he was from Angola.

1613
01:37:55.28 --> 01:38:01.32
He was a Cuban, stationed in Angola and had been shipped to Los Leos and then turned

1614
01:38:01.32 --> 01:38:04.40
around and he hated the Vietnamese so much.

1615
01:38:04.40 --> 01:38:07.20
He was trying to help us.

1616
01:38:07.20 --> 01:38:11.72
But we could see him on the other side of the river that where we were at on this particular

1617
01:38:11.72 --> 01:38:13.000
mission.

1618
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.40
And so that mission was in the KGB files that we had spoke to him and he had art and

1619
01:38:18.40 --> 01:38:22.40
they knew it was RTI to go and that knew it was Lin and me.

1620
01:38:22.40 --> 01:38:28.12
And so they had as much because we had spies and sigh on giving all this information out.

1621
01:38:28.12 --> 01:38:33.32
We had to spy that they finally caught an American.

1622
01:38:33.32 --> 01:38:35.64
It was giving all this information out.

1623
01:38:35.64 --> 01:38:38.48
But for two missions, I'm in the KGB files.

1624
01:38:38.48 --> 01:38:44.88
So on this oil drum mission, we get down there after we've been given the device

1625
01:38:44.88 --> 01:38:51.52
at night and I go in and I grab a hold of a drum and of course they have those little

1626
01:38:51.52 --> 01:38:52.52
lips on there.

1627
01:38:52.52 --> 01:38:56.44
I can pull that drum and they're full of about three quarters because they got to

1628
01:38:56.44 --> 01:38:58.24
be buoyant.

1629
01:38:58.24 --> 01:39:05.36
And I bring that fuel drum right to the side and I'm holding it there and dunk

1630
01:39:05.36 --> 01:39:11.60
there, unscrews it, the bug off and puts the new one in, screws it up tight.

1631
01:39:11.60 --> 01:39:15.36
Now I've got to get that drum back out into the flow.

1632
01:39:15.36 --> 01:39:23.20
While the flow is NVA walking it down with bamboo poles pushing them around.

1633
01:39:23.20 --> 01:39:28.32
So I get it out there but I can't get back because here they come.

1634
01:39:28.32 --> 01:39:32.76
So I had to go under and hold my breath but I can't hold my breath that long.

1635
01:39:32.76 --> 01:39:35.24
This water is ice cold right?

1636
01:39:35.24 --> 01:39:43.08
But fortunately I was a great swimmer in my youth and I could handle this but I could

1637
01:39:43.08 --> 01:39:50.92
get my nose just above the surface blow out and take a breath and go back under.

1638
01:39:50.92 --> 01:39:56.44
But because it's dark and they went on by me, finally, but I thought for sure they'd

1639
01:39:56.44 --> 01:40:01.32
stick me with one of the poles but they pushed that drum on down and the few drums

1640
01:40:01.32 --> 01:40:07.000
that were around me and I came back to the edge and crawled out but I was so cold I could

1641
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.24
hardly move.

1642
01:40:08.24 --> 01:40:16.92
I'm so open wet of course and Gunther says come on we got to go and I finally put my gear

1643
01:40:16.92 --> 01:40:21.92
back on my rutsack and the radio and my web gear and everything else back on and up the

1644
01:40:21.92 --> 01:40:27.44
hill we go but I'm still just barely making it just barely making it I'm so stiff.

1645
01:40:27.44 --> 01:40:32.48
Now we crawled out of there took two days to get out but that device was set for two

1646
01:40:32.48 --> 01:40:39.08
days but they hadn't gone off yet but we finally got extraction orders and they came and

1647
01:40:39.08 --> 01:40:44.96
got us and strung us out and when we were on strings it went off and the cubby writer

1648
01:40:44.96 --> 01:40:53.56
was there and it was like an atom bomb it was a miniature mushroom and the shockwave even

1649
01:40:53.56 --> 01:41:00.24
though we were miles away came through us on strings and the choppers and just like this

1650
01:41:00.24 --> 01:41:10.24
and we're going like this back and forth and the cubby plane is shaking like this and

1651
01:41:10.24 --> 01:41:15.24
I mean it was like an atomic bomb just went through us what you picture when you see and

1652
01:41:15.24 --> 01:41:20.20
then everything became calm and mission completed.

1653
01:41:20.20 --> 01:41:25.20
That's a good one. That's a real good one.

1654
01:41:25.20 --> 01:41:29.20
And they never knew. Never knew. Well they didn't know until the Russians knew. Yeah

1655
01:41:29.20 --> 01:41:33.68
other than that. They never knew who and we weren't allowed to talk or tell anybody in

1656
01:41:33.68 --> 01:41:39.88
camp when we got back. They just what were you doing? I just another day in song and that

1657
01:41:39.88 --> 01:41:44.48
was what we said because we weren't even allowed to tell anybody what we did because of

1658
01:41:44.48 --> 01:41:51.12
the CIA mission that we ran but everybody had certain things that they did like that.

1659
01:41:51.12 --> 01:41:54.28
But it was the first time it had ever been accomplished.

1660
01:41:54.28 --> 01:42:01.72
What did you notice about the one zeros that you had from a leadership perspective that

1661
01:42:01.72 --> 01:42:06.24
you remember as like yeah this is the quality some of the qualities that they had from

1662
01:42:06.24 --> 01:42:11.48
a leadership perspective that you would follow.

1663
01:42:11.48 --> 01:42:20.36
I was most fortunate I think I had great one zeros some of them not as great as others

1664
01:42:20.36 --> 01:42:33.000
but when you my first one he was my idol because my first two missions and thanksgiving

1665
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:44.08
of 68 and Christmas of 68 and you can't ever forget those you know. So the mission

1666
01:42:44.08 --> 01:42:51.36
of 68 is where I got the skip from the blow-up radio that let him know he was walking

1667
01:42:51.36 --> 01:43:00.36
into an act letting tilting know that he was walking into an ambush and I'm laying on a trail

1668
01:43:00.36 --> 01:43:07.28
with the radio on and heard this my interpreter comes up and interprets what's going on.

1669
01:43:07.28 --> 01:43:11.56
I managed to get a whole to spider parks he just happened to be going by for a radio

1670
01:43:11.56 --> 01:43:16.96
check and I told him what's going on he radios to to tilt to turn around and go back

1671
01:43:16.96 --> 01:43:23.000
that he had intel and tilt's going what yeah as the first time I ever had like a direct

1672
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.08
intel report do not go to the northeast this is the Christmas day mission we were on top

1673
01:43:27.08 --> 01:43:34.40
of that no and midnight talked about that was the one quiet area probably there's a problem

1674
01:43:34.40 --> 01:43:39.36
but we're talking about it spider goes do not go to the northeast we have an intel report

1675
01:43:39.36 --> 01:43:44.52
do not go there I'm going to like intel report that never happened before or after on a

1676
01:43:44.52 --> 01:43:51.40
live mission we're on the ground and we didn't know what to help us but they were right

1677
01:43:51.40 --> 01:43:55.60
we didn't you know the story we could extract is we're back in base a few days later

1678
01:43:55.60 --> 01:44:00.52
him and public connect and it's going like well well you want to ground a Christmas

1679
01:44:00.52 --> 01:44:07.16
and we found out that he had that intel report that was confirmed the one place we could

1680
01:44:07.16 --> 01:44:10.76
have gone we shouldn't have our instincts are right but we had a confirmation from

1681
01:44:10.76 --> 01:44:18.16
the intel report and it was just amazing you know it's just like to this day they got

1682
01:44:18.16 --> 01:44:24.12
out of it and due to other factors they got out of it but just that it saved the team was

1683
01:44:24.12 --> 01:44:29.72
walking into an L shape ambush that they've been slaughtered and they were pushing them

1684
01:44:29.72 --> 01:44:36.36
that way with trackers gunfire and everything else and so they just just like you say

1685
01:44:36.36 --> 01:44:44.36
the gods were always with us sometimes but at that very next day I'm still on the trail

1686
01:44:44.36 --> 01:44:48.64
where we were assigned that was the trail for my very first mission we got into North

1687
01:44:48.64 --> 01:44:53.60
Vietnam into it called nickel steel and I'm been laying there for four days

1688
01:44:53.60 --> 01:44:59.40
through this process and Gunther was I you know I mean Chotters was my one zero

1689
01:44:59.40 --> 01:45:07.88
and we were taking turns and it had been defolated with Agent Orange and so we

1690
01:45:07.88 --> 01:45:18.84
had a pretty good view and all of a sudden I saw six point men coming up MBA I'm

1691
01:45:18.84 --> 01:45:24.76
up there at the trail behind a log they're down below I give him the signal I give

1692
01:45:24.76 --> 01:45:29.96
him the signal I got six and I can see him and Chotters right away knows what's going

1693
01:45:29.96 --> 01:45:37.64
on so he's preparing the team to fight and X-Fill out of the situation but he can't

1694
01:45:37.64 --> 01:45:44.76
with me above but here comes one of the NVA it comes right up to the log and steps

1695
01:45:44.76 --> 01:45:49.52
over and steps right on me I put my car 15 into his belly and I pull the

1696
01:45:49.52 --> 01:45:55.48
trigger all 20 rounds made a gaping hole all the way through him through him over

1697
01:45:55.48 --> 01:46:03.36
the log and I'm on the run and I've got the radio and down the hill we go

1698
01:46:03.36 --> 01:46:12.16
and here comes 200 NVA and their point Jasonus and we're we're bringing I'm

1699
01:46:12.16 --> 01:46:16.02
trying to get tacky around the line I finally do we're putting tacky

1700
01:46:16.02 --> 01:46:20.72
here between them and us and I'm throwing smoke over my shoulder yeah

1701
01:46:20.72 --> 01:46:27.72
anything anything in the smoke and finally they bring the some slicks in and

1702
01:46:27.72 --> 01:46:34.52
pull us out and and get us out of there on strings yeah on strings again and

1703
01:46:34.52 --> 01:46:42.40
on the run and so the side note to the whole mission is I don't know how many we

1704
01:46:42.40 --> 01:46:48.08
killed but it was not a good day for them but that age in orange was the only

1705
01:46:48.08 --> 01:46:53.32
time I was ever near it and right now I've got stage four cancer from age in

1706
01:46:53.32 --> 01:47:00.24
orange with a limited amount of time left so that's why I'm glad I'm here to

1707
01:47:00.24 --> 01:47:09.72
tell a few stories glad you're here too they're born the um so how many tours did

1708
01:47:09.72 --> 01:47:16.84
you do was that one tour I signed up for what I volunteered to go in

1709
01:47:16.84 --> 01:47:20.52

1714
01:47:44.52 --> 01:47:53.76
out I kind of went back to rodeo and training horses and things like that and

1715
01:47:53.76 --> 01:48:03.64
then I sort of got calm got your past license yeah I got my pilot's license

1716
01:48:03.64 --> 01:48:08.04
fixed wing and rotary well you got home how long did it take to kind of adapt

1717
01:48:08.04 --> 01:48:14.04
to the civilian life it took about a year that because I slept with my car

1718
01:48:14.04 --> 01:48:19.32
15 and then when I was in training group I always had all the weapons around me

1719
01:48:19.32 --> 01:48:25.68
I felt safe but you know fourth of July it was always a hard one with stuff

1720
01:48:25.68 --> 01:48:31.80
going on you don't know and it took me a while to to calm down and not because

1721
01:48:31.80 --> 01:48:38.28
I had a lot of kills and you just have to work through all that all the time and

1722
01:48:38.28 --> 01:48:45.60
I was pretty good because not after that period of time you know we'd never

1723
01:48:45.60 --> 01:48:49.72
talked to each other we weren't allowed to talk about it for 20 years as

1724
01:48:49.72 --> 01:48:55.56

1729
01:49:18.88 --> 01:49:24.08

1748
01:51:05.28 --> 01:51:10.80
because we can what did you what did you do for a job so you you had to kind of

1749
01:51:10.80 --> 01:51:15.24
continue to kind of get it out of your system where breaking horses or whatever

1750
01:51:15.24 --> 01:51:20.52

1751
01:51:20.52 --> 01:51:24.56
went into construction business I went into construction business that my father

1752
01:51:24.56 --> 01:51:31.28
had gone into a private construction for a particular person and so at left the

1753
01:51:31.28 --> 01:51:38.000
license open so I just continued the license and he handed it over to me and I

1754
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:45.72
built for almost 45 years now retired now what where did you guys overlap was

1755
01:51:45.72 --> 01:51:50.60
that did you guys overlap in RT Idaho is that when you guys overlap well we are at

1756
01:51:50.60 --> 01:51:55.44
food by when he came in he came with Bubba okay and so my government got him

1757
01:51:55.44 --> 01:52:00.32
first before I were talking to him and I got Bubba so we were in camp we're

1758
01:52:00.32 --> 01:52:04.68
training together at the firing range then Bubba and I were doing our targets

1759
01:52:04.68 --> 01:52:11.12
they're doing theirs and then when we moved he was that he closed out that will

1760
01:52:11.12 --> 01:52:15.48
be one he's the last SF troop there his recon team closed it locked the gate

1761
01:52:15.48 --> 01:52:21.28
by that time Lynn and I were down in the Nang already so we were running

1762
01:52:21.28 --> 01:52:27.44
business he went down with with with RT Virginia with Guntherwald and so they

1763
01:52:27.44 --> 01:52:32.04
went down and ran their business including the famous oil drum one and Lynn and

1764
01:52:32.04 --> 01:52:37.68
I were doing our thing and then by April my time in country was getting close

1765
01:52:37.68 --> 01:52:42.32
so Lynn had agreed to be to come to one zero we had a special mission we were

1766
01:52:42.32 --> 01:52:47.72
supposed to go up to the Mughi up past we brought Doug in Max Forron and Barry

1767
01:52:47.72 --> 01:52:52.52
and an officer to go with us on that mission we trained for the mission

1768
01:52:52.52 --> 01:52:58.000
trained right up to it went to the launch site on the choppers took off and they

1769
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.40
called us back and because two aircraft were shot down over the target area

1770
01:53:01.40 --> 01:53:08.68
that day and so I was about four or five days from D-Rosing we went back to

1771
01:53:08.68 --> 01:53:12.68
the camp they prism up the marble mountain so we're up there we have some

1772
01:53:12.68 --> 01:53:17.80
pictures from that time there and then I walked off the marble mountain

1773
01:53:17.80 --> 01:53:23.80
back up my gear and went home so Doug stayed with Idaho so from April at

1774
01:53:23.80 --> 01:53:28.48
the end of April all the way through Dr. over 69 he's with Idaho with Lynn and

1775
01:53:28.48 --> 01:53:34.88
they ran a load of missions and I come back he had just left base but Lynn's

1776
01:53:34.88 --> 01:53:39.76
there so the Lynn was the one zero so he and I took turns and then finally

1777
01:53:39.76 --> 01:53:43.40
so our gym major goes as too much experience here black you're out of here and

1778
01:53:43.40 --> 01:53:48.68
then I went back to being a one zero for another five months and then but at

1779
01:53:48.68 --> 01:53:53.000
time he had come home but he's in training group so technically he got out of

1780
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.08
the army after I did like I got out in April you got out in June and July

1781
01:53:57.08 --> 01:54:02.64
September first September first yeah and so I went my I went back to the

1782
01:54:02.64 --> 01:54:07.40
Garden State and then he went back to California and separate ways and we did

1783
01:54:07.40 --> 01:54:12.08
we had the cards and some notes I don't think my phone calls and it just

1784
01:54:12.08 --> 01:54:15.88
let us back if we had a couple of guys I had other people I stayed in contact

1785
01:54:15.88 --> 01:54:20.20
with and then I just figured he got a job with a CIA or just something

1786
01:54:20.20 --> 01:54:25.36
somewhere else you know and then finally got the phone call on 2000 and the

1787
01:54:25.36 --> 01:54:29.28
rest of his story and how often do you guys the link up now?

1788
01:54:29.28 --> 01:54:35.32
Every day it's all in the phone it's like you and the Eccletrails now.

1789
01:54:35.32 --> 01:54:43.44
We we talk almost every day and because we can we're alive and we try now

1790
01:54:43.44 --> 01:54:50.36
to spread the story since we've been declassified like you're helping

1791
01:54:50.36 --> 01:54:55.36
tremendously to spread this story to let people know that we actually

1792
01:54:55.36 --> 01:54:59.000
there was a secret war going on and we were actually taking the war to the

1793
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.40
enemy because our country had signed a treaty saying that we would not go into

1794
01:55:04.40 --> 01:55:10.80
North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia or the DMZ which we operated in every day

1795
01:55:10.80 --> 01:55:16.12
right we weren't stationed here we just flew in by helicopters people always ask

1796
01:55:16.12 --> 01:55:20.24
me well how long did you fight in South Vietnam I said I never fought a day in

1797
01:55:20.24 --> 01:55:26.56
South Vietnam they all you didn't do anything no that's true you're right

1798
01:55:26.56 --> 01:55:32.40
it's what was your reaction as stuff started to kind of come to the surface and

1799
01:55:32.40 --> 01:55:40.24
people started talking about it it was a slow it's been a slow process I've

1800
01:55:40.24 --> 01:55:44.32
got a hold of tilt and then we saw each other for the very first time after

1801
01:55:44.32 --> 01:55:47.84
all those years I was standing on a corner when I drove by and picked

1802
01:55:47.84 --> 01:55:54.28
the most yeah and we went to an air show and we started talking we had our

1803
01:55:54.28 --> 01:55:59.52
photo albums that we weren't supposed to have because no pictures were supposed

1804
01:55:59.52 --> 01:56:04.72
to be taken look at all the pictures that are out good recon man always do

1805
01:56:04.72 --> 01:56:11.60
whatever they want right so but it's been a slowy says well we have a reunion

1806
01:56:11.60 --> 01:56:18.32
now I really we'd have it in Vegas every October now and it's been going on

1807
01:56:18.32 --> 01:56:25.28
what 45 years they're 43 or 44 years worth I've been there about 18 years now

1808
01:56:25.28 --> 01:56:30.84
it's best of operations association yeah and so we go there and see each

1809
01:56:30.84 --> 01:56:36.36
other and sit around and drink and of course I don't drink but you know we

1810
01:56:36.36 --> 01:56:41.48
everybody drinks and it's a free bar and and tell old war stories each other

1811
01:56:41.48 --> 01:56:46.40
and just be a couple of lies and the stories get more exaggerated and but we

1812
01:56:46.40 --> 01:56:52.32
have a we we have the up but problem is we're dying faster than then you

1813
01:56:52.32 --> 01:56:58.48
can we we were losing about 10 or 12 tops six seven in the very beginning

1814
01:56:58.48 --> 01:57:02.68
now we're losing over 50 a year there weren't that many of us to start with

1815
01:57:02.68 --> 01:57:08.08
but this is a combined all the support troops actual recon troops there's

1816
01:57:08.08 --> 01:57:14.60
probably not but 45 or 50 there at all because we only had what 450 reconers

1817
01:57:14.60 --> 01:57:22.04
as you talk to yeah you know and so we have this great reunion every year

1818
01:57:22.04 --> 01:57:27.84
and I just never miss it because I don't know who's gonna die just like yesterday

1819
01:57:27.84 --> 01:57:34.20
was our interpreter perhaps two year anniversary of his death and most

1820
01:57:34.20 --> 01:57:38.48
everybody's going down with age orange of some kind of cancer and stuff

1821
01:57:38.48 --> 01:57:45.56
Elden Bardswell just went down from an accident he was our two star general

1822
01:57:45.56 --> 01:57:49.10
very proud of him but at the time he was we were both

1826
01:58:01.56 --> 01:58:04.16

1837
01:58:56.44 --> 01:58:59.84

1843
01:59:28.92 --> 01:59:32.72
care at the hospital picked up for him right away they couldn't believe a

1863
02:01:09.92 --> 02:01:15.36
so I've left that action figure for him and that's the famous picture

1864
02:01:15.36 --> 02:01:21.40
yes the famous sag the Frenchman yes I've seen it there's a good review of it on

1865
02:01:21.40 --> 02:01:27.88
on YouTube I watch yeah you can go to YouTube and look up Frenchman action

1866
02:01:27.88 --> 02:01:34.12
figure and it's done really well by Ryan Peters yeah he did a really excellent

1867
02:01:34.12 --> 02:01:40.84
job even made the box and everything for yeah no it works it's pretty awesome

1868
02:01:40.84 --> 02:01:46.68
well definitely I'll definitely post that that picture when when this goes up

1869
02:01:46.68 --> 02:01:50.96
when this goes out onto the under the inner web says they say and you got

1870
02:01:50.96 --> 02:01:54.64
your Frenchman challenge coin I got my Frenchman challenge coin yeah it's right

1871
02:01:54.64 --> 02:02:00.48
here the lowest ranking challenge coming out makes the general's on beat

1872
02:02:00.48 --> 02:02:07.76
there's a p of c challenge code it doesn't give much better than that

1873
02:02:07.76 --> 02:02:15.000
for sure you got anything else I think it's a good place to be and if you

1874
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.52
listen to this and you think a more things you want to say but you know I think

1875
02:02:18.52 --> 02:02:22.84
this is a good good spot to wrap up this one so if you got anything to tell

1876
02:02:22.84 --> 02:02:29.12
you got anything else first no these stories you know it's funny because

1877
02:02:29.12 --> 02:02:34.64
even we're in base we never knew a lot of the details and so when I put the

1878
02:02:34.64 --> 02:02:39.20
books together talk to other people like the oil drums story we learned

1879
02:02:39.20 --> 02:02:43.04
about 40 years later that Lynn Black had done the similar thing with RTI

1880
02:02:43.04 --> 02:02:49.52
the how after I left right in between these guys and it's just like a lot of

1881
02:02:49.52 --> 02:02:55.04
history that comes out slowly like Doug has said was anyone tracking was anyone

1882
02:02:55.04 --> 02:02:59.72
right down the history as it was happening was anyone taking the operational

1883
02:02:59.72 --> 02:03:04.08
summaries and compiling them somewhere they were all destroyed that was

1884
02:03:04.08 --> 02:03:09.72
when I left food by one of my jobs was to go through and make sure that all

1885
02:03:09.72 --> 02:03:15.80
the drums had been no the ashes they'd burnt all the a lot of reports after

1886
02:03:15.80 --> 02:03:22.28
action reports were all burnt and then as we pulled out of every FOB and

1887
02:03:22.28 --> 02:03:29.16
closed down CCN and CCS and CCC we closed all the everything was destroyed there's

1888
02:03:29.16 --> 02:03:35.04
very few after action reports so with there are is just miniscule reports people

1889
02:03:35.04 --> 02:03:39.56
try to put them out on eBay but they're fake they're just isn't any

1890
02:03:39.56 --> 02:03:44.52
and there are out there we haven't there reports of archives that were even now

1891
02:03:44.52 --> 02:03:49.60
beginning to look into but at a recent reunion the guy came up to me and said hey

1892
02:03:49.60 --> 02:03:54.84
you know if you've done your books I got to like to talk to you because my job

1893
02:03:54.84 --> 02:04:03.32
when we closed contone was to destroy all the records yeah a lot of valor yeah

1894
02:04:03.32 --> 02:04:09.28
we that's that's why I didn't even receive my purple heart for that first

1895
02:04:09.28 --> 02:04:15.16
mission until 11 11 11 11 really yeah had to go back to the paperwork on it

1896
02:04:15.16 --> 02:04:22.56

1897
02:04:22.56 --> 02:04:28.84
lot of this and a lot of that and it took six years until Diane black my

he says I got Twitter with him I got everything with his my buddy yeah I

1952
02:09:43.64 --> 02:09:49.08
mean why would I even expect that somebody would have it's such a small world

1953
02:09:49.08 --> 02:09:53.72
it really is well we go out of service while part that one percent or less of

1954
02:09:53.72 --> 02:10:00.24
our country that's served the country yeah and I'll tell you the amount of

1955
02:10:00.24 --> 02:10:04.60
feedback I've gotten from you came on till that mean it's been overwhelming the

1956
02:10:04.60 --> 02:10:08.28
number of people that just you know thank you for your service they're gonna pass

1957
02:10:08.28 --> 02:10:13.20
the same thing on to you you know you guys should know that America loves you

1958
02:10:13.20 --> 02:10:17.76
guys for what you did for this country oh thank you thank you you too

1959
02:10:17.76 --> 02:10:30.08
airborne airborne all the way all the way and with that song has left the

1960
02:10:30.08 --> 02:10:36.88
building the Frenchmen and tilt have departed awesome what an one honor

1961
02:10:36.88 --> 02:10:42.08
have those guys on and I got to say this right after we got done of course

1962
02:10:42.08 --> 02:10:50.16
we did some more talking and the Frenchmen was was explaining the fact that

1963
02:10:50.16 --> 02:10:55.80
when he would go out on a mission every mission he would go out on he would

1964
02:10:55.80 --> 02:11:01.40
square away his footwalker make sure everything was ready to be shipped home

1965
02:11:01.40 --> 02:11:07.64
because every time he went out he figured he would not be coming back

1966
02:11:07.64 --> 02:11:21.72
so real heroes and it's awesome to be able to sit here and talk to those guys and

1967
02:11:21.72 --> 02:11:33.76
what a what an honor that is and anyways you know actually one of the

1968
02:11:33.76 --> 02:11:38.08
reasons that I can sit here and talk to guys like tilt and the Frenchmen is

1969
02:11:38.08 --> 02:11:47.52
because of all the support that comes in from all of you so I appreciate you

1970
02:11:47.52 --> 02:11:55.48
know that because as you know I don't have any like regular whatever they're

1971
02:11:55.48 --> 02:12:02.80
called advertisements on here because I'm not gonna interrupt someone like tilt or

1972
02:12:02.80 --> 02:12:06.80
someone like the Frenchmen or someone like BTF Tony or someone like Dakota

1973
02:12:06.80 --> 02:12:13.84
Meyer I'm not gonna interrupt them so I can say you know hey buy this or buy

1974
02:12:13.84 --> 02:12:23.32
that or whatever you know I'm not gonna stop reading colder than hell or I'm

1975
02:12:23.32 --> 02:12:27.88
not gonna stop reading the forgotten highlander I'm not gonna stop reading

1976
02:12:27.88 --> 02:12:35.32
one soldiers war so that I can you know mention a product or something like that so

1977
02:12:35.32 --> 02:12:44.36
to me that's not what this podcast is about the information and yeah the

1978
02:12:44.36 --> 02:12:49.84
information in this podcast is what is it paramount to me and getting it to all of

1979
02:12:49.84 --> 02:13:00.56
you uninterrupted is what matters because I will tell you that I wish that I could

1980
02:13:00.56 --> 02:13:03.76
have listened to this podcast when I was growing up or even when I was a kid

1981
02:13:03.76 --> 02:13:10.72
when I was in the teams just to just to have this information would have been

1982
02:13:10.72 --> 02:13:19.80
really helpful to me so I'm not keeping it from anyone so that's what we're

1983
02:13:19.80 --> 02:13:25.24
doing here so if you do want to help out which like I said that's that's what

1984
02:13:25.24 --> 02:13:28.08
allows us to be able to do this that's what allows me to able to fly the

1985
02:13:28.08 --> 02:13:34.08
Frenchmen out here to sit down and and talk and tell his story and so it's

1986
02:13:34.08 --> 02:13:40.60

2045
02:19:08.52 --> 02:19:17.44
Doug Laterno the Frenchman for doing everything that they did to fight against

2046
02:19:17.44 --> 02:19:25.96
the dark tyranny of communism as it tried to spread through the world they

2047
02:19:25.96 --> 02:19:33.52
they held the line and it's incredible the operations that they did and it's

2048
02:19:33.52 --> 02:19:40.24
incredible the sacrifices that those operators made in that time especially and

2049
02:19:40.24 --> 02:19:50.92
obviously the ones that did not come home and to the rest of you that have

2050
02:19:50.92 --> 02:19:57.96
served or you are serving thank you for keeping us safe from today's threats

2051
02:19:57.96 --> 02:20:11.40
which are vast and equally evil it is you that keeps us secure and keeps our

2052
02:20:11.40 --> 02:20:15.24
way of life secure and to our police and law enforcement to the firefighters

2053
02:20:15.24 --> 02:20:21.16
out there to the paramedics EMTs dispatchers correctional officers boarder

2054
02:20:21.16 --> 02:20:30.88
patrol secret service and all other first responders you are on call every day

2055
02:20:30.88 --> 02:20:39.52
you are waiting when we need help you are there so thank you for keeping us safe

2056
02:20:39.52 --> 02:20:49.68
and to everyone else out there remember what the Frenchman

2057
02:20:49.68 --> 02:20:56.08
said after his kernel god done explaining the treacherous situation that they

2058
02:20:56.08 --> 02:21:02.48
were set to go into when that kernel asks if anyone had any questions the

2059
02:21:02.48 --> 02:21:12.40
Frenchman replied where do you need help where do you need help

2060
02:21:12.40 --> 02:21:19.76
it's a simple question but it's a powerful one there's people around you that need

2061
02:21:19.76 --> 02:21:30.84
help ask them what it is they need ask them where it is that they need help

2062
02:21:30.84 --> 02:21:36.20
and then get up and lock and load your sawed off M79 or whatever tool it is

2063
02:21:36.20 --> 02:21:44.88
that you need to unleash to give them the help that they need and until next time

2064
02:21:44.88 --> 02:22:07.08
this is jaco out
