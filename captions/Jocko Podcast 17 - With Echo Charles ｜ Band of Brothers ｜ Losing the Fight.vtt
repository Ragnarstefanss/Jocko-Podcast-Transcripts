00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 17 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.62
It's been ten years since April 2nd 2006. Ten years since those of us in 4th

3
00:00:17.62 --> 00:00:23.96
Platoon huddled around the radio outside of an Iraqi army post near Camp Romadi trying

4
00:00:23.96 --> 00:00:31.32
to make sense of the confused and uncertain radio traffic of the exos calm and firm voice

5
00:00:31.32 --> 00:00:39.92
from the COC trying to determine what truck had been hit and who was missing.

6
00:00:39.92 --> 00:00:45.72
Ten years since we drove the road back towards the Gov Center with fear in our minds and

7
00:00:45.72 --> 00:00:54.60
hate in our hearts knowing we had lost close friends but not yet sure of the names.

8
00:00:54.60 --> 00:01:00.56
Ten years since I met my platoon commander on the dark and steps of the Gov Center as

9
00:01:00.56 --> 00:01:06.80
he came down from the COC and confirmed which truck it had been and when I pressed for

10
00:01:06.80 --> 00:01:13.96
who was gone he simply said all of them.

11
00:01:13.96 --> 00:01:20.000
He hadn't yet learned that one guy who was a fucking hard ass who wasn't going to let death

12
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.04
take another marine that day and whose recovery has been an inspiration to all those

13
00:01:25.04 --> 00:01:29.32
men who know him.

14
00:01:29.32 --> 00:01:37.92
Ten years since I did my best to pass the word to my team with steadfastness but repeating

15
00:01:37.92 --> 00:01:45.32
all of them revealing me for the twenty year one year old I was through the tears I was

16
00:01:45.32 --> 00:01:49.000
trying to hold back.

17
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.32
Ten years of trying to figure out what their sacrifice meant of shifting views on what

18
00:01:55.32 --> 00:01:58.96
it was all for in the end.

19
00:01:58.96 --> 00:02:05.84
That is something that is still a struggle but I've found solace and purpose in these

20
00:02:05.84 --> 00:02:09.04
facts.

21
00:02:09.04 --> 00:02:20.56
Staff Sergeant Eric McIntosh, Corporal Scott Procopio, Lance Corporal Kun, Young Kim and

22
00:02:20.56 --> 00:02:27.20
Hospital Men Giovanni Padilla were men who chose to be part of something bigger than

23
00:02:27.20 --> 00:02:28.48
themselves.

24
00:02:28.48 --> 00:02:34.000
Men who chose to enter a profession of crushingly hard work sacrifice and danger all

25
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.32
for the simple purpose of protecting the men around them.

26
00:02:39.32 --> 00:02:44.88
Staff Sergeant Mack was the epitome of a fighting marine, a stud who exuded proficiency

27
00:02:44.88 --> 00:02:50.32
and professionalism, were also being humorous and approachable.

28
00:02:50.32 --> 00:02:55.36
Procopio is without a doubt when the finest men I've ever had the fortune of meeting,

29
00:02:55.36 --> 00:03:01.48
a beast of a marine who drove all around him with his enthusiasm and good nature.

30
00:03:01.48 --> 00:03:06.20
While we were peers, I looked up to him and his natural leadership.

31
00:03:06.20 --> 00:03:09.36
I still do.

32
00:03:09.36 --> 00:03:12.76
Kim had a quiet reliability about him.

33
00:03:12.76 --> 00:03:17.84
Unlike the usual loud, grigiriousness that people tend to associate with grunts, he

34
00:03:17.84 --> 00:03:20.36
was low key and dependable.

35
00:03:20.36 --> 00:03:25.20
And for some reason I can still see the way a smile would creep over his face when stupid

36
00:03:25.20 --> 00:03:30.12
shit was going on and he'd laugh in a way that made it seem like he was seeing a deeper

37
00:03:30.12 --> 00:03:35.20
joke that you didn't get yet.

38
00:03:35.20 --> 00:03:40.76
Doc Padillo was new to the company and my memories of him are vague, but the men who knew

39
00:03:40.76 --> 00:03:47.32
him better describe a young corpsman who was enthusiastic about his job.

40
00:03:47.32 --> 00:03:52.28
The funny thing with corpsman is that sometimes you don't need to know much to judge their

41
00:03:52.28 --> 00:03:59.000
character besides the fact that these young men volunteered for one specific duty.

42
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:09.88
To save the lives of their marines in combat, a more honorable calling is hard to find.

43
00:04:09.88 --> 00:04:16.68
It's easy for today to be dark to get sucked into the trap of loss, regret, depression,

44
00:04:16.68 --> 00:04:19.08
and anger.

45
00:04:19.08 --> 00:04:26.36
It's easy to drown it in liquor under the pretence of having one for the boys.

46
00:04:26.36 --> 00:04:32.64
This morning as we prepare ourselves to face the tenth of these days, we think of Scott

47
00:04:32.64 --> 00:04:35.76
and his booming laugh.

48
00:04:35.76 --> 00:04:40.72
He wouldn't want us sitting around morning like saps, wasting our precious days, burdened

49
00:04:40.72 --> 00:04:48.08
with his death, like tormented widows out of some 19th century romance fiction.

50
00:04:48.08 --> 00:04:53.60
He'd remind us that we all joined up for the same reasons.

51
00:04:53.60 --> 00:04:56.28
We are infantry marines.

52
00:04:56.28 --> 00:05:01.68
We wanted to fight to energetically meet the enemy in battle and crush him.

53
00:05:01.68 --> 00:05:09.52
To serve beside men with whom we would build a bond stronger than most will ever know.

54
00:05:09.52 --> 00:05:18.92
While the politics are complicated and the outcomes unclear, one thing is certain.

55
00:05:18.92 --> 00:05:23.000
Their sacrifice was not in vain.

56
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.44
It was the sacrifice that warriors make for each other.

57
00:05:27.44 --> 00:05:34.48
April 2nd is a day that defines us now, brings us together as brothers.

58
00:05:34.48 --> 00:05:38.96
It is a day of remembrance and reflection.

59
00:05:38.96 --> 00:05:46.12
A day that gives us reason to look at our lives and say, look, you son of a bitch.

60
00:05:46.12 --> 00:05:49.40
This is why you have to live life to the fullest.

61
00:05:49.40 --> 00:05:55.80
This is why you must fight every day to be a better man.

62
00:05:55.80 --> 00:06:03.92
And then we must just remember that Scott, Procopio, would call you a pussy for doing the

63
00:06:03.92 --> 00:06:07.48
opposite.

64
00:06:07.48 --> 00:06:22.36
For five jins, we will never forget you.

65
00:06:22.36 --> 00:06:30.60
So that was a post that someone forwarded to me that was on bread.

66
00:06:30.60 --> 00:06:32.64
It was from an anonymous marine.

67
00:06:32.64 --> 00:06:39.64
Obviously, this marine was from the three eight marines who we served with in Ramadi, who

68
00:06:39.64 --> 00:06:45.36
were just outstanding warriors.

69
00:06:45.36 --> 00:06:58.08
I thought that that tribute not only to the fallen, but also a form of council to his fellow

70
00:06:58.08 --> 00:07:00.72
marines.

71
00:07:00.72 --> 00:07:10.28
I just thought that that was an amazing piece of writing and I wanted to share it with everyone.

72
00:07:10.28 --> 00:07:15.60
April 2nd.

73
00:07:15.60 --> 00:07:26.08
Now speaking of Ramadi, which, you know, just like this marine, it's something that I think

74
00:07:26.08 --> 00:07:31.28
about all the time and something that I refer back to a couple of podcasts ago, we talked

75
00:07:31.28 --> 00:07:39.08
about the band of brothers, the first of the 506, who we also served with in Ramadi.

76
00:07:39.08 --> 00:07:45.92
And it is a truly hallowed unit.

77
00:07:45.92 --> 00:07:55.76
And if you've seen the HBO miniseries band of brothers, just a fantastic memorial and representation

78
00:07:55.76 --> 00:07:59.000
of these American fighting men.

79
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.88
And the leader of that group, or one of the leaders of easy company and then of the

80
00:08:05.88 --> 00:08:11.84
battalion, was a guy by the name of Major Dick Winners.

81
00:08:11.84 --> 00:08:22.76
And he wrote after his, after he came famous, really, from the first book by Stephen

82
00:08:22.76 --> 00:08:29.76
Ambrose called Band of Brothers and then the miniseries came out, called Band of Brothers.

83
00:08:29.76 --> 00:08:40.80
He wrote a book, which is called Beyond Band of Brothers, the warm memoirs of Major Dick

84
00:08:40.80 --> 00:08:49.72
Winners.

85
00:08:49.72 --> 00:08:54.48
And I got to this book basically because I was going to do Band of Brothers, this Stephen

86
00:08:54.48 --> 00:08:55.48
Ambrose.

87
00:08:55.48 --> 00:09:00.64
But as everybody knows, or if you don't know, I like to get the source material from the

88
00:09:00.64 --> 00:09:02.52
people that were there.

89
00:09:02.52 --> 00:09:04.68
Stephen Ambrose is a historian.

90
00:09:04.68 --> 00:09:11.08
And so I identified this book as I was researching more deeply into Band of Brothers.

91
00:09:11.08 --> 00:09:14.24
I very quickly found this book, ordered it.

92
00:09:14.24 --> 00:09:18.68
And yeah, there's no doubt.

93
00:09:18.68 --> 00:09:28.52
So let me kick this off.

94
00:09:28.52 --> 00:09:33.12
As Battalion operations officer, Hester pointed to where an enemy machine gun was located

95
00:09:33.12 --> 00:09:38.76
in approximately where a four gun battery of 105s was situated.

96
00:09:38.76 --> 00:09:40.84
That was all he knew.

97
00:09:40.84 --> 00:09:45.08
Captain Hester turned to me and said, there's fire along that hedge road there.

98
00:09:45.08 --> 00:09:47.04
Take care of it.

99
00:09:47.04 --> 00:09:49.08
That was the sum of my orders.

100
00:09:49.08 --> 00:09:54.76
No detailed battle plan, no intelligence summary, nothing but a specific task to be accomplished

101
00:09:54.76 --> 00:09:57.000
without delay.

102
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.36
Easy company's mission was to silence the battery.

103
00:10:03.36 --> 00:10:05.80
We talk about the basic principles of combat.

104
00:10:05.80 --> 00:10:07.92
One of them is simple, clear concise.

105
00:10:07.92 --> 00:10:08.92
There you go.

106
00:10:08.92 --> 00:10:09.92
That's your orders.

107
00:10:09.92 --> 00:10:11.12
There's fire along that hedge road.

108
00:10:11.12 --> 00:10:12.92
Take care of it.

109
00:10:12.92 --> 00:10:17.64
And this is also, obviously, an unbelievable example of decentralized command.

110
00:10:17.64 --> 00:10:19.72
You go solve this problem.

111
00:10:19.72 --> 00:10:22.08
And his response is I got it.

112
00:10:22.08 --> 00:10:27.16
Back to the book, conducting a mental estimate of the situation I viewed any infantry

113
00:10:27.16 --> 00:10:31.60
assault on the battery as a high risk opportunity since our air forces had failed to destroy

114
00:10:31.60 --> 00:10:37.44
the artillery battery in the preliminary bombardment prior to the seaborn invasion.

115
00:10:37.44 --> 00:10:43.20
Our key would be initiative and immediate appraisal of the situation, skillful use of the terrain

116
00:10:43.20 --> 00:10:48.24
and our ability to destroy one gun at a time.

117
00:10:48.24 --> 00:10:52.64
So you'll notice, he's going to, as soon as he knows that there's multiple guns, what

118
00:10:52.64 --> 00:10:54.04
does he decide to do?

119
00:10:54.04 --> 00:10:57.04
One gun at a time, solve one problem at a time.

120
00:10:57.04 --> 00:11:02.16
Little something we like to call a prioriortized and execute.

121
00:11:02.16 --> 00:11:07.16
The first thing I did was have everybody drop all equipment except ammunition and grenades.

122
00:11:07.16 --> 00:11:11.48
So that was all we would need if things went from good to bad.

123
00:11:11.48 --> 00:11:13.60
To get rid of the things you don't need.

124
00:11:13.60 --> 00:11:15.56
Focus on this one task that we've got right now.

125
00:11:15.56 --> 00:11:19.72
It's another prioritized and execute orger right there.

126
00:11:19.72 --> 00:11:23.56
While the non-commissioned officers prepared the men for the assault, I conducted a hasty

127
00:11:23.56 --> 00:11:26.48
reconnaissance of the enemy position.

128
00:11:26.48 --> 00:11:30.84
A leader gains an advantage in combat if he's able to appraise the terrain and the situation

129
00:11:30.84 --> 00:11:33.40
quickly and correctly.

130
00:11:33.40 --> 00:11:36.52
Crawling along the hedge road, I moved to a position where I could get a better view of the

131
00:11:36.52 --> 00:11:37.88
enemy position.

132
00:11:37.88 --> 00:11:42.04
The guns appear to be set in the trench and the head road covered by a machine gun

133
00:11:42.04 --> 00:11:44.92
fire from across an open pasture.

134
00:11:44.92 --> 00:11:49.68
The battery was firing directly down, causeway number two in the direction of Utah Beach

135
00:11:49.68 --> 00:11:54.40
where the initial waves of the fourth infantry division were already landing.

136
00:11:54.40 --> 00:12:01.04
So you've got these German guns in an elevated position hammering Utah Beach where the fourth

137
00:12:01.04 --> 00:12:03.44
infantry division is trying to land right now.

138
00:12:03.44 --> 00:12:05.88
It's a nightmare.

139
00:12:05.88 --> 00:12:10.24
It's anticipating that it would be too costly to conduct a frontal attack across an open

140
00:12:10.24 --> 00:12:11.24
field.

141
00:12:11.24 --> 00:12:16.08
I determined our chances of success would be greatly enhanced if we could hit the enemy

142
00:12:16.08 --> 00:12:21.44
on the flank and silence one gun at a time.

143
00:12:21.44 --> 00:12:24.04
Hit the enemy on the flank.

144
00:12:24.04 --> 00:12:29.12
Again, these are basic principles and I hate calling, I hate using the word basic, because

145
00:12:29.12 --> 00:12:30.52
it's fundamentals.

146
00:12:30.52 --> 00:12:32.64
It's nothing basic about it.

147
00:12:32.64 --> 00:12:35.48
It's basic, but it's beautiful.

148
00:12:35.48 --> 00:12:39.36
It's simplicity.

149
00:12:39.36 --> 00:12:44.56
Returning to the company, I assign specific missions to each man.

150
00:12:44.56 --> 00:12:47.16
So everybody knows what their task is going to be.

151
00:12:47.16 --> 00:12:50.52
First I placed one of easy companies to machine guns in a position where they could

152
00:12:50.52 --> 00:12:54.92
provide a covering fire as we move carefully into position.

153
00:12:54.92 --> 00:12:57.64
Cover and move.

154
00:12:57.64 --> 00:13:02.52
Next I divided our detachment into two units, one led by Lieutenant Buck Compton and the

155
00:13:02.52 --> 00:13:06.08
other remaining with me.

156
00:13:06.08 --> 00:13:10.88
Compton moved down one headrow with Sergeant Garnier and Malarke to get his close to the

157
00:13:10.88 --> 00:13:17.36
first gun in the battery as possible, while I led my unit down a parallel headrow.

158
00:13:17.36 --> 00:13:23.84
Compton also sent Sergeant Slipton and Rainy to conceal position to put flanking fire on

159
00:13:23.84 --> 00:13:29.44
the enemy while my detachment crawled across the open field to approach the gun first.

160
00:13:29.44 --> 00:13:34.28
Once you've got multiple covering move situations going on right now, and again to the

161
00:13:34.28 --> 00:13:40.32
military folks that are listening this, you could breeze through this description and miss

162
00:13:40.32 --> 00:13:45.16
how important that is, how important and what a great example of covering move this is,

163
00:13:45.16 --> 00:13:48.36
got to put down that cover fire, you got to put down that cover fire and that's why

164
00:13:48.36 --> 00:13:52.56
you got to bring them heavy weapons out there, bring those AWs out boys.

165
00:13:52.56 --> 00:13:56.12
Lots of them.

166
00:13:56.12 --> 00:14:01.88
In my group, back to the book, when my group consisting of Corporal Joe Toy, PFC Robert

167
00:14:01.88 --> 00:14:07.08
Pop-I-Win, and private Gerald the Rain from Regimental Headquarters, reached the hedge that

168
00:14:07.08 --> 00:14:10.04
led to the enemy position and we stopped.

169
00:14:10.04 --> 00:14:13.88
Here I placed a second machine gun to engage the first gun that was firing point blank

170
00:14:13.88 --> 00:14:14.88
at us.

171
00:14:14.88 --> 00:14:18.12
I gave the gun instructions and not to fire unless he saw a definite target so he would

172
00:14:18.12 --> 00:14:20.48
not give away his position.

173
00:14:20.48 --> 00:14:22.88
Then we worked our way up to Compton's headrow.

174
00:14:22.88 --> 00:14:26.56
Here I spotted a German helmet and squeezed off two rounds.

175
00:14:26.56 --> 00:14:30.36
Later I found a pool of blood at this position, but no Jerry.

176
00:14:30.36 --> 00:14:33.28
Jerry's term for German.

177
00:14:33.28 --> 00:14:36.88
Next I sent Compton with two men along the hedge to throw a hand grenades at the enemy

178
00:14:36.88 --> 00:14:40.56
position while the rest of us supported him with covering fire.

179
00:14:40.56 --> 00:14:45.92
These guys don't do anything without covering fire.

180
00:14:45.92 --> 00:14:50.76
I fired occasionally to fill spots when there was a low in the covering fire due to putting

181
00:14:50.76 --> 00:14:52.80
in new clips.

182
00:14:52.80 --> 00:14:56.18
Compton took too long getting his detachment into position and we spent more ammunition

183
00:14:56.18 --> 00:15:00.16
than we should have, but in return we received no enemy fire.

184
00:15:00.16 --> 00:15:05.12
That covering fire, even though it took too long, but they didn't receive any enemy

185
00:15:05.12 --> 00:15:07.60
fire because they were laying down that fire.

186
00:15:07.60 --> 00:15:10.20
They were laying down that covering fire.

187
00:15:10.20 --> 00:15:14.44
Just as Compton was ready to hurl his grenades, I started across the field with the rest

188
00:15:14.44 --> 00:15:16.24
of the assault team.

189
00:15:16.24 --> 00:15:20.28
So that what we jumped in the position together as the grenades exploded.

190
00:15:20.28 --> 00:15:24.20
And simultaneously we heard additional grenades at the next position.

191
00:15:24.20 --> 00:15:29.68
In return we received substantial smaller arms fire and grenades from the enemy.

192
00:15:29.68 --> 00:15:35.84
As we approached the first gun, Papai win was hitting the butt and fell down in the trench.

193
00:15:35.84 --> 00:15:39.88
Rather than complaining that he was hit, he apologized.

194
00:15:39.88 --> 00:15:45.08
I'm sorry Lieutenant, I goofed, I goofed, I'm sorry.

195
00:15:45.08 --> 00:15:49.76
My God, it's beautiful when you think of a guy who is so dedicated to his company that

196
00:15:49.76 --> 00:15:52.80
he apologizes for getting hit.

197
00:15:52.80 --> 00:15:59.60
Now he was a soldier hit by enemy fire in Normandy on D Day behind German lines.

198
00:15:59.60 --> 00:16:05.44
And he's more upset that he'd let his buddies down than he was concerned with his own injury.

199
00:16:05.44 --> 00:16:07.52
Papai's action.

200
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:11.80
Papai's actions spoke for all of us.

201
00:16:11.80 --> 00:16:18.76
Now I'm fast-forwarding a little bit to get these guns taken down.

202
00:16:18.76 --> 00:16:24.12
With the entire battery now destroyed, we now withdrew because the machine gun fire that

203
00:16:24.12 --> 00:16:28.72
we were receiving from the matterhouse and other positions remained intense.

204
00:16:28.72 --> 00:16:32.68
I pulled our own machine guns out first, then the rifleman.

205
00:16:32.68 --> 00:16:37.68
I was last to leave, and as I was leaving, I took a final look down the trench, and there

206
00:16:37.68 --> 00:16:42.08
was one wounded Jerry trying to put a machine gun onto into operation.

207
00:16:42.08 --> 00:16:44.48
I drilled him through the head.

208
00:16:44.48 --> 00:16:49.88
On our way back, I came across warn officer, J.G. Andrew Hill, who had been killed working

209
00:16:49.88 --> 00:16:52.40
his way up to help us.

210
00:16:52.40 --> 00:16:58.64
In all, we had suffered four dead, six wounded, and we had inflicted 15 dead and 12 captured

211
00:16:58.64 --> 00:17:00.04
enemy.

212
00:17:00.04 --> 00:17:04.88
German forces in the vicinity of the battery had outnumbered about 50.

213
00:17:04.88 --> 00:17:11.64
About three hours passed since I had received the order to dispose of the battery.

214
00:17:11.64 --> 00:17:16.48
And then, so they take care of that, they conduct some other smaller operations, and then

215
00:17:16.48 --> 00:17:21.000
it goes to the end of D-Day.

216
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.12
At long last D-Day was over, our success had been to superb leadership at all levels, and

217
00:17:29.12 --> 00:17:32.80
the training we had experienced prior to the invasion.

218
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:38.40
Add luck to the equation, an easy company comprised of formidable team.

219
00:17:38.40 --> 00:17:41.28
In reflection, we were highly charged.

220
00:17:41.28 --> 00:17:47.72
We knew what to do, and we conducted ourselves as part of a well-oiled machine.

221
00:17:47.72 --> 00:17:52.96
Because we were so intimate with each other, I knew the strengths of each of my troopers.

222
00:17:52.96 --> 00:17:59.28
This is something that he refers back to a lot, was really understanding his men, what

223
00:17:59.28 --> 00:18:02.36
they were like, what drove them, what their strengths and weaknesses were, so he could

224
00:18:02.36 --> 00:18:07.000
put them in the correct positions.

225
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.48
Being allowed us a few minutes of quiet reflection.

226
00:18:11.48 --> 00:18:16.44
With our outposts in place, I stretched out to catch a few hours of sleep, even though

227
00:18:16.44 --> 00:18:22.44
the rattle of German small arms fire continued throughout the night.

228
00:18:22.44 --> 00:18:27.16
Before I dosed off, I did not forget to get on my knees and thank God for helping me

229
00:18:27.16 --> 00:18:33.08
live through this day, and to ask his help on D-Plus One.

230
00:18:33.08 --> 00:18:38.84
I would live this war one day at a time, and I promised myself that if I survived,

231
00:18:38.84 --> 00:18:43.96
I would find a small farm somewhere in Pennsylvania countryside and spend the remainder

232
00:18:43.96 --> 00:18:54.04
of my life in quiet and peace.

233
00:18:54.04 --> 00:19:02.80
Now, as you hear about Dick Winners, and that's, I wanted to cover at least one

234
00:19:02.80 --> 00:19:08.88
engagement, one actual engagement, and that's one of them, so you can kind of see the methodology,

235
00:19:08.88 --> 00:19:11.52
the principles that he's putting into action.

236
00:19:11.52 --> 00:19:16.16
But I want to concentrate not so much on the action now, but more on the leadership,

237
00:19:16.16 --> 00:19:18.48
the leadership pieces of it.

238
00:19:18.48 --> 00:19:23.88
Although there's still, I still do talk about some of the combat situations that they

239
00:19:23.88 --> 00:19:29.72
get into, because they were in a war.

240
00:19:29.72 --> 00:19:34.36
And I want to check in going back a little bit from where he came from, what his mindset,

241
00:19:34.36 --> 00:19:42.28
what developed it, and he says this, I had a wonderful mother, very conservative.

242
00:19:42.28 --> 00:19:46.80
She came from a men and night family, but never converted to that faith.

243
00:19:46.80 --> 00:19:55.40
Honesty and discipline were driven into my head from day one.

244
00:19:55.40 --> 00:20:00.28
At some point, I'm just going to have to stop like even accenting these things.

245
00:20:00.28 --> 00:20:10.60
These common themes that are just run through these leaders, not surprisingly, mother was

246
00:20:10.60 --> 00:20:14.12
undoubtedly one of the most influential people in my life.

247
00:20:14.12 --> 00:20:21.12
A mother takes a child, she nurtures him, she instills discipline, and she teaches respect.

248
00:20:21.12 --> 00:20:27.32
My mother was the first one up every morning.

249
00:20:27.32 --> 00:20:32.60
She prepared breakfast for my sister and in me, and she was the last one to bed every

250
00:20:32.60 --> 00:20:35.04
evening.

251
00:20:35.04 --> 00:20:39.64
In many respects, she was the ideal company commander.

252
00:20:39.64 --> 00:20:44.84
And subconsciously, I'm sure I patterned my own leadership abilities on this remarkable

253
00:20:44.84 --> 00:20:47.92
woman.

254
00:20:47.92 --> 00:20:52.72
So it's interesting, all he talked about was that she was the first one to work, and

255
00:20:52.72 --> 00:20:55.40
she was the last one to leave work, meaning she was the first one up in the morning,

256
00:20:55.40 --> 00:20:57.44
and she was the last one to leave.

257
00:20:57.44 --> 00:21:02.04
And with that statement alone, he said that she's the ideal company commander.

258
00:21:02.04 --> 00:21:07.04
Now, for those of you that aren't the military, your company commander is there's several

259
00:21:07.04 --> 00:21:11.24
companies in a battalion, there could be three, maybe four, maybe even five, depending on

260
00:21:11.24 --> 00:21:12.84
the task organization.

261
00:21:12.84 --> 00:21:17.56
But it's a hundred, maybe 150 guys generally in a company.

262
00:21:17.56 --> 00:21:23.48
So he's saying that this, that his mom would be an ideal company commander.

263
00:21:23.48 --> 00:21:24.48
Why?

264
00:21:24.48 --> 00:21:29.64
Because she wakes up early and has a lot of discipline.

265
00:21:29.64 --> 00:21:32.56
Newsflash.

266
00:21:32.56 --> 00:21:37.24
Now, speaking of, yeah, I won't read any more actions.

267
00:21:37.24 --> 00:21:39.88
Here's another action.

268
00:21:39.88 --> 00:21:44.68
I positioned men on both sides of the road and prepared to move out in order to secure

269
00:21:44.68 --> 00:21:45.68
the intersection.

270
00:21:45.68 --> 00:21:49.72
Here they are on a move, they're got to secure an intersection.

271
00:21:49.72 --> 00:21:53.80
Lieutenant Wells led first platoon at the head of the company, column.

272
00:21:53.80 --> 00:21:57.20
Precisely on schedule, I hollowed Wells move out.

273
00:21:57.20 --> 00:22:01.24
Just as the attack started, a German machine gun located in a building at the foot of the

274
00:22:01.24 --> 00:22:03.36
hill started to fire up the road.

275
00:22:03.36 --> 00:22:09.000
The German gun crew is in perfect position at the perfect time to wipe out our entire

276
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.04
attack.

277
00:22:11.04 --> 00:22:17.48
On the left hand side of the road, Wells pushed six men towards the intersection.

278
00:22:17.48 --> 00:22:22.56
They went straight at that intersection and the enemy machine gun.

279
00:22:22.56 --> 00:22:25.24
The enemy fire, however, was very effective.

280
00:22:25.24 --> 00:22:30.08
Our men on both sides of the road kept low profiles and the ditches, heads down and they

281
00:22:30.08 --> 00:22:36.72
frozen place, leaving Wells and his six men assaulting the intersection alone.

282
00:22:36.72 --> 00:22:42.08
Using my rear, Colonel Strayer and his staff, including Captain Hester and Nixon, could

283
00:22:42.08 --> 00:22:44.04
see what was happening.

284
00:22:44.04 --> 00:22:49.92
They in turn were hollowing at me, get them moving, winners get them moving.

285
00:22:49.92 --> 00:22:55.44
I struggled out of my harness to rid myself of excess equipment so that I could run.

286
00:22:55.44 --> 00:22:58.48
Since it was obvious what needed to be done.

287
00:22:58.48 --> 00:23:02.64
So guess what, people aren't moving, people aren't taking action and it's obvious to

288
00:23:02.64 --> 00:23:04.88
him what needs to be done.

289
00:23:04.88 --> 00:23:08.000
Looking at the middle of the column on the right hand side of the road, I hollowed, move

290
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.52
out, move out.

291
00:23:09.52 --> 00:23:10.80
This did no good.

292
00:23:10.80 --> 00:23:13.88
Everyone had his heads down.

293
00:23:13.88 --> 00:23:19.04
This was the one and only time in the war that I really blew my top and physically kicked

294
00:23:19.04 --> 00:23:20.28
ass.

295
00:23:20.28 --> 00:23:24.04
I came out of that ditch with only my M1 in hand and haulering.

296
00:23:24.04 --> 00:23:28.04
I ran to the head of the column, kicked ass on the left side of the road, then ran to the

297
00:23:28.04 --> 00:23:33.24
right side of the road, back and forth, screaming at my top of my voice, get going.

298
00:23:33.24 --> 00:23:37.36
I will never forget the surprise and fear on those faces looking up at me.

299
00:23:37.36 --> 00:23:41.36
With me running around on the road like a wild man, the machine gunner seemed to zero in

300
00:23:41.36 --> 00:23:42.36
on me.

301
00:23:42.36 --> 00:23:44.68
I was a wide open target.

302
00:23:44.68 --> 00:23:49.96
The bullet snapped by and glanced off the road all around me.

303
00:23:49.96 --> 00:23:54.36
For a short time, I had the feeling of being blessed.

304
00:23:54.36 --> 00:23:57.88
That feeling didn't last too long for hours to find out in a few minutes that I wasn't

305
00:23:57.88 --> 00:24:03.000
so blessed.

306
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.92
And the reason I highlighted that section right there, because in the next literally the next

307
00:24:07.92 --> 00:24:13.56
page in the book, you get this idea, and again, this is the idea that people have of military

308
00:24:13.56 --> 00:24:14.56
leaders.

309
00:24:14.56 --> 00:24:18.12
Is that they're these hard ass guys and these kick ass guys that are running around

310
00:24:18.12 --> 00:24:22.20
and yelling like what I just read.

311
00:24:22.20 --> 00:24:30.64
I wanted to highlight that because now we fast forward one page in the book.

312
00:24:30.64 --> 00:24:35.52
And taking the intersection, easy companies sustain ten casualties.

313
00:24:35.52 --> 00:24:40.76
Among our wounded were Sergeant Lippden, Ed Tipper, and Burr Smith.

314
00:24:40.76 --> 00:24:46.48
Another casualty was Private Albert Belive, who was in the aid station sitting with his

315
00:24:46.48 --> 00:24:52.68
back against the wall when I entered to have my wound cleaned, because by the way, major

316
00:24:52.68 --> 00:24:54.28
winners got hit.

317
00:24:54.28 --> 00:24:57.08
And so he's in there getting his wound cleaned.

318
00:24:57.08 --> 00:25:03.000
Now he's looking at Private Blife, and he says here, I did not notice any wounds.

319
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.52
So I asked how are you doing, Blife?

320
00:25:06.52 --> 00:25:10.80
I can't see, I can't see he replied.

321
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:15.32
I remember trying to comfort him by saying it's okay, Blife, relax, they'll have you out

322
00:25:15.32 --> 00:25:19.40
of your soon and they'll send you back to England.

323
00:25:19.40 --> 00:25:24.92
As I started to move away, Blife stood up suddenly saying, I'm okay, I'm okay, I can

324
00:25:24.92 --> 00:25:28.12
see now.

325
00:25:28.12 --> 00:25:32.20
As soon as Blife regained his vision, he immediately returned to duty.

326
00:25:32.20 --> 00:25:37.08
If you think about that for a minute, that boy had been paralyzed by fear.

327
00:25:37.08 --> 00:25:41.64
Yet he had the guts and dedication to stick to his buddies in easy company.

328
00:25:41.64 --> 00:25:45.76
As soon as he relaxed and pulled himself together, he returned to the front, rather than

329
00:25:45.76 --> 00:25:50.68
taking the easy way out, with an evacuation.

330
00:25:50.68 --> 00:25:58.68
Sometimes all a soldier needed was a calm voice reassuring him that everything was fine.

331
00:25:58.68 --> 00:26:03.44
In Blife's case, he rejoined the company and was wounded in action during the upcoming

332
00:26:03.44 --> 00:26:05.000
fight.

333
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.68
After World War II, he served in the 187th Airborne Regiment in the Korean War where

334
00:26:10.68 --> 00:26:14.68
he was awarded a silver star and the bronze star.

335
00:26:14.68 --> 00:26:20.64
By the time he retired from military service, Blife was a company first sergeant.

336
00:26:20.64 --> 00:26:28.08
So, the contrast there is that, instead of pulling a general George Patton and slapping

337
00:26:28.08 --> 00:26:31.88
the guy around and saying, you're not wounded, he realized what he needed to do, which was

338
00:26:31.88 --> 00:26:32.88
just comfort the guy.

339
00:26:32.88 --> 00:26:33.88
Say, hey, listen, everything's okay.

340
00:26:33.88 --> 00:26:39.76
We'll get you on a plane, we'll get you back to England, just take it easy.

341
00:26:39.76 --> 00:26:45.92
Here's a section that I'm just going to jump too quickly when he's talking about the confusion

342
00:26:45.92 --> 00:26:52.36
getting in the confusion getting our men into position was as bad as we were to ever see.

343
00:26:52.36 --> 00:26:57.92
One time I found easy company troops firing into troops of another battalion.

344
00:26:57.92 --> 00:27:06.08
Later we had some tanks show up for support and they began firing into our own mind.

345
00:27:06.08 --> 00:27:14.24
So that's Blue On Blue, it's Fratur side and we talk about it in our book and it's one

346
00:27:14.24 --> 00:27:18.04
of those things that they usually don't show it.

347
00:27:18.04 --> 00:27:24.04
They usually don't portray it because it's hard to believe that things can get that confusing,

348
00:27:24.04 --> 00:27:26.96
but they do.

349
00:27:26.96 --> 00:27:30.56
And it goes all the way back.

350
00:27:30.56 --> 00:27:36.32
And clear example right there.

351
00:27:36.32 --> 00:27:42.56
Now we're going back to Blife and this is an interesting commentary on training.

352
00:27:42.56 --> 00:27:48.40
And one of our daylight patrols led by Sergeant Garnier, Blife was point man when he spotted

353
00:27:48.40 --> 00:27:52.24
a German sniper in a tree.

354
00:27:52.24 --> 00:27:58.88
Just as he did in training, he automatically said bang, bang instead of dropping to the side

355
00:27:58.88 --> 00:28:02.36
of the road and putting his rifle on the sniper.

356
00:28:02.36 --> 00:28:08.68
So if you can imagine you're back in America or when they were doing their pre-attack training

357
00:28:08.68 --> 00:28:12.08
in England and they weren't using real bullets, so they're out on a patrol and if they

358
00:28:12.08 --> 00:28:14.60
saw something, they'd go bang, bang.

359
00:28:14.60 --> 00:28:18.40
Well, that's literally what the guy did.

360
00:28:18.40 --> 00:28:23.04
The German reacted first and shot Blife through the collarbone, the rest of the patrol,

361
00:28:23.04 --> 00:28:28.000
recovered Blife and then withdrew to easy lines.

362
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.32
So again, military people that are listening, law enforcement, you train how you fight,

363
00:28:36.32 --> 00:28:38.08
and you fight how you train.

364
00:28:38.08 --> 00:28:40.96
So you just gotta keep that in mind all the time.

365
00:28:40.96 --> 00:28:46.04
If you're giving yourself some kind of a training scar by doing something like a lip gun,

366
00:28:46.04 --> 00:28:47.64
we actually did this in the sealed team.

367
00:28:47.64 --> 00:28:50.20
Lip gun, that's what we call it, it's embarrassing.

368
00:28:50.20 --> 00:28:52.44
In my early days, that's what we want to have a choice.

369
00:28:52.44 --> 00:28:53.44
Like what you make sound like a band.

370
00:28:53.44 --> 00:28:55.44
Like bang, bang, yeah, you're mouth.

371
00:28:55.44 --> 00:28:56.44
Yeah.

372
00:28:56.44 --> 00:29:03.88
And thankfully now they have unbelievable good systems, the paintball type systems that go in

373
00:29:03.88 --> 00:29:14.84
our real guns, the laser tag type systems, so we don't have to use lip guns.

374
00:29:14.84 --> 00:29:18.28
Back to the book, next sector.

375
00:29:18.28 --> 00:29:23.08
Success breeds confidence and easy company success and normandy instilled the confidence

376
00:29:23.08 --> 00:29:27.88
that they would need to succeed and live to fight another day.

377
00:29:27.88 --> 00:29:35.32
At the same time, I could not help but think that had I trained the men harder.

378
00:29:35.32 --> 00:29:42.40
If I had done a better job, maybe more of my men would have come home.

379
00:29:42.40 --> 00:29:47.20
That's something a leader is always going to be thinking, always going to be thinking that.

380
00:29:47.20 --> 00:29:48.48
What could we have done better?

381
00:29:48.48 --> 00:29:52.04
What could I have done better?

382
00:29:52.04 --> 00:29:57.56
Now they get back to England, they're taking a break, they get pulled off the line,

383
00:29:57.56 --> 00:30:00.04
and he's back in Al, and Aldborn.

384
00:30:00.04 --> 00:30:10.48
He's just talking about he's sort of reflecting back on his initial push into Europe.

385
00:30:10.48 --> 00:30:15.80
You know you got guys there out drinking and doing whatever they're doing, and he says,

386
00:30:15.80 --> 00:30:19.72
ask for myself, I relaxed the best I could.

387
00:30:19.72 --> 00:30:24.96
Combat had made me tense, particularly since my decisions now meant life or death to the

388
00:30:24.96 --> 00:30:28.28
members of my command.

389
00:30:28.28 --> 00:30:34.60
Commanding soldiers and combat requires a personal detachment from the men themselves.

390
00:30:34.60 --> 00:30:40.52
In a sense, command is the loneliest job in the world.

391
00:30:40.52 --> 00:30:47.68
Looking at myself in the mirror, I could see how much I had changed, I could sense it.

392
00:30:47.68 --> 00:30:52.04
Another thing that affected me was the importance of discipline.

393
00:30:52.04 --> 00:31:03.08
The necessity of instilling discipline to my troops and getting the job done in combat.

394
00:31:03.08 --> 00:31:08.36
In an attempt to escape the tension that combat had caused, I developed a heavier than

395
00:31:08.36 --> 00:31:14.04
usual exercise regimen, and I attended church on a regular basis.

396
00:31:14.04 --> 00:31:19.04
There were only a few days that I didn't run two to three miles, two 80 pushups, 60

397
00:31:19.04 --> 00:31:23.32
situps on a foot locker, that a couple of splits and some leg and trunk exercises after

398
00:31:23.32 --> 00:31:26.000
the day's work was over.

399
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.92
As a result, I kept in pretty good shape, not what I'd call wrestling shape, but good

400
00:31:30.92 --> 00:31:33.64
enough for army work.

401
00:31:33.64 --> 00:31:46.000
Physical activity kept me mentally alert, built my endurance, and kept me supple.

402
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.08
You got to do it.

403
00:31:48.08 --> 00:31:50.68
You got to have that discipline and you got to work out.

404
00:31:50.68 --> 00:31:52.56
You got to do it every day.

405
00:31:52.56 --> 00:31:55.000
It's that important.

406
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.84
Yeah, see how I mentioned how it kept him mentally sharp.

407
00:31:58.84 --> 00:31:59.84
It absolutely does.

408
00:31:59.84 --> 00:32:05.20
Yeah, it's it that before that's one of the few things that you can do that affects everything

409
00:32:05.20 --> 00:32:07.32
and everything in life.

410
00:32:07.32 --> 00:32:08.48
You are correct.

411
00:32:08.48 --> 00:32:13.48
I think people a lot of time in regards to exercise people think, well, exercise, that's

412
00:32:13.48 --> 00:32:14.76
for a certain kind of person.

413
00:32:14.76 --> 00:32:17.52
You know, maybe a fitness person or something like that.

414
00:32:17.52 --> 00:32:19.20
That's for a dumb joke, right?

415
00:32:19.20 --> 00:32:20.20
I'm a smart person.

416
00:32:20.20 --> 00:32:22.20
I'm not going to exercise long answer.

417
00:32:22.20 --> 00:32:26.16
Yeah, I think nowadays people are more hip to it for sure, but do you say hip?

418
00:32:26.16 --> 00:32:30.000
Hitman, down, down with the cause, the new stuff.

419
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Yeah, yeah.

420
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.60
But yeah, it is interesting how these leaders back then, they knew that.

421
00:32:37.60 --> 00:32:41.68
Yep, even though there's been no, even though at that time there's been no scientific

422
00:32:41.68 --> 00:32:44.44
study, their scientific study is now that proved it.

423
00:32:44.44 --> 00:32:45.44
He didn't know that.

424
00:32:45.44 --> 00:32:46.44
He just knew it.

425
00:32:46.44 --> 00:32:47.44
Yeah, he felt that he lived it.

426
00:32:47.44 --> 00:32:56.20
Now, they're in a position now, again, I'm just fast forward.

427
00:32:56.20 --> 00:32:59.64
And even though I said I wasn't going to cover too much in the combat, I'm covering

428
00:32:59.64 --> 00:33:00.64
the combat.

429
00:33:00.64 --> 00:33:06.44
Because the combat is what puts these people in these leadership positions.

430
00:33:06.44 --> 00:33:11.56
Combat is the ultimate teacher, the harshest teacher, and the teachers you lessons that you

431
00:33:11.56 --> 00:33:15.52
do not forget.

432
00:33:15.52 --> 00:33:20.04
So they're around this village of foi, which is a village that was held by the Germans

433
00:33:20.04 --> 00:33:22.56
and they'd been waiting.

434
00:33:22.56 --> 00:33:27.36
And they'd been a while.

435
00:33:27.36 --> 00:33:34.92
And here's winners talking about, here's winners talking about his troops.

436
00:33:34.92 --> 00:33:38.08
They were now completely exhausted.

437
00:33:38.08 --> 00:33:43.96
They had had no hot food, little sleep, no rest, constant tension, and the pressure of

438
00:33:43.96 --> 00:33:46.08
combat.

439
00:33:46.08 --> 00:33:51.20
The worst time was night when temperatures plummeted and fog covered the battlefield until

440
00:33:51.20 --> 00:33:53.32
mid-delate morning.

441
00:33:53.32 --> 00:33:59.16
The uncertainty of what lay just yards ahead in the next treeline was sufficient to break

442
00:33:59.16 --> 00:34:01.80
ordinary men.

443
00:34:01.80 --> 00:34:07.32
Not surprisingly, the men became physically exhausted.

444
00:34:07.32 --> 00:34:13.64
Physical exhaustion leads to mental exhaustion, which in turn causes men to lose discipline.

445
00:34:13.64 --> 00:34:20.76
Laws of self-discipline then produces combat fatigue.

446
00:34:20.76 --> 00:34:25.24
Self-discipline keeps a soldier doing his job.

447
00:34:25.24 --> 00:34:29.80
Without it, he loses his pride, and he loses the importance of self-respecting the

448
00:34:29.80 --> 00:34:32.96
eyes of his fellow soldiers.

449
00:34:32.96 --> 00:34:38.28
It is pride that keeps a soldier going and keeps him in the fight.

450
00:34:38.28 --> 00:34:45.88
This is what I feared I would lose, the loss of will to measure up to my men.

451
00:34:45.88 --> 00:34:50.96
After seeing others break down, you wondered who is next, and you started taking a hard look

452
00:34:50.96 --> 00:34:54.20
at yourself.

453
00:34:54.20 --> 00:35:02.72
I often wondered why I didn't break under the strain of combat.

454
00:35:02.72 --> 00:35:07.84
One factor undoubtedly lay in the fact that my battalion headquarters lay 75 yards behind

455
00:35:07.84 --> 00:35:10.96
the Ford Foxholes.

456
00:35:10.96 --> 00:35:14.68
No longer was I under enemy observation.

457
00:35:14.68 --> 00:35:18.80
Consequently, I was able to concentrate on my duties without fear of enemy small arms

458
00:35:18.80 --> 00:35:20.76
fire.

459
00:35:20.76 --> 00:35:25.12
Another factor was undoubtedly my physical conditioning.

460
00:35:25.12 --> 00:35:28.52
I don't think there was a man in the battalion who was in better physical shape than I

461
00:35:28.52 --> 00:35:30.52
was.

462
00:35:30.52 --> 00:35:35.92
My responsibility to ensure the safety of the soldiers also hardened me to cope with the daily

463
00:35:35.92 --> 00:35:41.60
stress of combat.

464
00:35:41.60 --> 00:35:45.16
One last observation on combat fatigue.

465
00:35:45.16 --> 00:35:50.72
When you see a man break, he usually slams his helmet down and messes up his hair.

466
00:35:50.72 --> 00:35:55.28
I don't know if it's conscious or unconscious, but a soldier goes to his head and massages

467
00:35:55.28 --> 00:35:59.04
his head, shakes it, and then he's gone.

468
00:35:59.04 --> 00:36:02.80
You can talk to him all you want, but he cannot hear you.

469
00:36:02.80 --> 00:36:08.40
When he reaches that point, the best thing for everybody is just to let him take a walk.

470
00:36:08.40 --> 00:36:11.92
Combat exhaustion occurs instantaneously.

471
00:36:11.92 --> 00:36:16.44
You don't plan to become a combat fatigue casualty.

472
00:36:16.44 --> 00:36:19.16
How do you prevent combat fatigue?

473
00:36:19.16 --> 00:36:24.32
You talk to your troops and make some excuse to pull a soldier off the front line.

474
00:36:24.32 --> 00:36:29.08
Of course pulling a soldier off the front line increases the stress of those who remain,

475
00:36:29.08 --> 00:36:31.96
but is a necessary trade-off.

476
00:36:31.96 --> 00:36:37.04
I often asked a soldier who might saw on the verge of a breakdown, how about coming back

477
00:36:37.04 --> 00:36:40.76
with me to the CP to help out for a couple of days?

478
00:36:40.76 --> 00:36:45.08
In this manner, you invent a reason for pulling a guy from the line without damaging his

479
00:36:45.08 --> 00:36:46.52
psyche.

480
00:36:46.52 --> 00:36:53.96
So, bunch of stuff there on combat fatigue.

481
00:36:53.96 --> 00:36:58.52
I'm not saying that you're going to see combat fatigue in the civilian world.

482
00:36:58.52 --> 00:37:02.84
But you do see people get stressed out in business.

483
00:37:02.84 --> 00:37:08.64
I thought that that common about people messing up their hair and grabbing their head.

484
00:37:08.64 --> 00:37:14.28
That's a really good indicator of when people are breaking.

485
00:37:14.28 --> 00:37:18.28
I'll tell you one of the things, this is something that we talk about of the book, as

486
00:37:18.28 --> 00:37:28.44
well as for us, the guys that had the most resistance to combat fatigue with a

487
00:37:28.44 --> 00:37:35.04
guy that were most inturately involved in the planning of the operations.

488
00:37:35.04 --> 00:37:37.52
They felt like they had control.

489
00:37:37.52 --> 00:37:39.76
Unfortunately, we didn't know this.

490
00:37:39.76 --> 00:37:44.44
We had guys that weren't involved, maybe they were new guys, or they just weren't that

491
00:37:44.44 --> 00:37:46.40
involved in the planning or whatever.

492
00:37:46.40 --> 00:37:48.96
All they were getting told was like, hey, get your gear on.

493
00:37:48.96 --> 00:37:49.96
You're going out again.

494
00:37:49.96 --> 00:37:50.96
Come back from that operation.

495
00:37:50.96 --> 00:37:51.96
Hey, get your gear on.

496
00:37:51.96 --> 00:37:52.96
Come back from that operation.

497
00:37:52.96 --> 00:37:53.96
Hey, get your gear on.

498
00:37:53.96 --> 00:37:55.68
You're going out again.

499
00:37:55.68 --> 00:37:58.84
Those guys that didn't really get involved in the planning, it was harder for them because

500
00:37:58.84 --> 00:38:00.48
they didn't feel like they had any control.

501
00:38:00.48 --> 00:38:02.48
And they didn't see the risk mitigation that was happening.

502
00:38:02.48 --> 00:38:04.20
And they didn't understand the strategy well enough.

503
00:38:04.20 --> 00:38:05.20
Why?

504
00:38:05.20 --> 00:38:06.64
Because I didn't tell them, my fault.

505
00:38:06.64 --> 00:38:09.68
You know, I should have been more engaged than I should have explained to them the impact

506
00:38:09.68 --> 00:38:10.68
that they were having.

507
00:38:10.68 --> 00:38:13.000
I should have explained to them the overall strategic picture.

508
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
And I tried to do that.

509
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.32
And I thought I did it, but I didn't do well enough.

510
00:38:17.32 --> 00:38:22.44
And those are the guys that definitely were the most stressed out.

511
00:38:22.44 --> 00:38:25.64
So leaders out there, it's just another reason.

512
00:38:25.64 --> 00:38:31.24
It's another reason to tell people why they're doing what they're doing and get them involved

513
00:38:31.24 --> 00:38:34.84
in the planning and get them ownership of the planning.

514
00:38:34.84 --> 00:38:37.84
So they feel like they have some control over it.

515
00:38:37.84 --> 00:38:38.84
Interesting.

516
00:38:38.84 --> 00:38:42.88
Oh, they mentioned how they dealt with that when they'd pull them off the line, right?

517
00:38:42.88 --> 00:38:45.40
But they wouldn't just be like straight up straight.

518
00:38:45.40 --> 00:38:46.88
Don't, hey, you're messing up.

519
00:38:46.88 --> 00:38:47.88
Get off the line.

520
00:38:47.88 --> 00:38:48.88
No.

521
00:38:48.88 --> 00:38:52.40
It was like they pulled them off the line in a way that wouldn't, wouldn't mess them up.

522
00:38:52.40 --> 00:38:54.08
Do we need you to take care of the supply issue?

523
00:38:54.08 --> 00:38:55.08
Yeah.

524
00:38:55.08 --> 00:38:56.48
Go back there for me and get this figured out.

525
00:38:56.48 --> 00:38:57.48
Yeah.

526
00:38:57.48 --> 00:38:58.48
Okay, I'll do it.

527
00:38:58.48 --> 00:39:00.04
Give them a break, give them a rest.

528
00:39:00.04 --> 00:39:01.36
This is something hack worth talked about too.

529
00:39:01.36 --> 00:39:05.60
I mean, hack worth says, you know, about face, you know, he talks about he just says,

530
00:39:05.60 --> 00:39:08.16
hey, everyone's got a cup of certain size cup.

531
00:39:08.16 --> 00:39:12.36
Some people have a bigger cup than others, but when the cup gets filled up, that's it.

532
00:39:12.36 --> 00:39:13.36
They're done.

533
00:39:13.36 --> 00:39:16.16
And if you let the cup get filled up and overflow, then they're done forever.

534
00:39:16.16 --> 00:39:19.60
But if you can catch it beforehand, they can go back a little bit and drain their cup out.

535
00:39:19.60 --> 00:39:23.12
That's exactly what you talk about when you say manipulation.

536
00:39:23.12 --> 00:39:24.12
All right.

537
00:39:24.12 --> 00:39:28.52
You tell them just in a kind of a gingerly kind of way.

538
00:39:28.52 --> 00:39:31.68
You know, make them signed on to the whole situation.

539
00:39:31.68 --> 00:39:32.68
Yeah.

540
00:39:32.68 --> 00:39:38.08
Yeah, no doubt about it.

541
00:39:38.08 --> 00:39:42.04
This is going back to his discipline.

542
00:39:42.04 --> 00:39:48.04
My routine was to shave every morning and then to inspect the line.

543
00:39:48.04 --> 00:39:52.76
And in retrospect, shaving in the bitter cold was pretty ridiculous.

544
00:39:52.76 --> 00:39:57.56
But the practice had originated with one of my first meetings with Colonel Sink.

545
00:39:57.56 --> 00:40:01.96
At Tacoa, Sink had required us to shave every morning.

546
00:40:01.96 --> 00:40:04.56
He said, you shave every morning for the men.

547
00:40:04.56 --> 00:40:07.48
And if you want to, shave every evening for the women.

548
00:40:07.48 --> 00:40:09.32
But that's up to you.

549
00:40:09.32 --> 00:40:13.20
But I want you to said an example.

550
00:40:13.20 --> 00:40:15.60
He was absolutely right.

551
00:40:15.60 --> 00:40:19.92
I remember one morning when we prepared for our attack on foi.

552
00:40:19.92 --> 00:40:23.76
I got up in the middle of the night to shave before getting something to eat.

553
00:40:23.76 --> 00:40:26.76
In the process, I cut myself up pretty badly.

554
00:40:26.76 --> 00:40:29.20
I must have looked like hell.

555
00:40:29.20 --> 00:40:33.52
When Colonel Sink arrived to check on us before the attack commenced, he took one look

556
00:40:33.52 --> 00:40:36.72
at me and had a huge smile on his face.

557
00:40:36.72 --> 00:40:41.28
I later, I realized later that he was laughing at me for shaving on that bitterly cold

558
00:40:41.28 --> 00:40:42.28
morning.

559
00:40:42.28 --> 00:40:46.28
But that was one of the things I did to set an example for the men.

560
00:40:46.28 --> 00:40:50.96
Shave in the morning and once in a while, I would strip to the waist and give myself a French

561
00:40:50.96 --> 00:40:54.88
wash, a routine that caught everyone's attention.

562
00:40:54.88 --> 00:41:00.40
I did this for one reason and one reason only to get the men's attention and to let them

563
00:41:00.40 --> 00:41:04.44
know that I was going to be around for a while and this wasn't as bad as they thought

564
00:41:04.44 --> 00:41:06.44
it was going to be.

565
00:41:06.44 --> 00:41:11.08
Make the best of it.

566
00:41:11.08 --> 00:41:18.56
And what I like about that is his total awareness of the impact that he's having on his

567
00:41:18.56 --> 00:41:19.56
men.

568
00:41:19.56 --> 00:41:22.76
He knows that they are watching them and if you're in a leadership position, you've got to

569
00:41:22.76 --> 00:41:25.32
recognize that people are watching you.

570
00:41:25.32 --> 00:41:26.32
Parents.

571
00:41:26.32 --> 00:41:27.32
Yeah.

572
00:41:27.32 --> 00:41:31.32
If you're a parent, you've got to realize that person that you're leading called your child,

573
00:41:31.32 --> 00:41:32.32
they're watching you.

574
00:41:32.32 --> 00:41:37.44
It's more critical than most of the time anyway, than what you say.

575
00:41:37.44 --> 00:41:42.76
And people will make this excuse saying that they say, hey, do what I say, not what I

576
00:41:42.76 --> 00:41:43.76
do.

577
00:41:43.76 --> 00:41:44.76
Meanwhile, you're doing all this stuff.

578
00:41:44.76 --> 00:41:48.84
That's not how they're going to be like, oh, that's just something you say.

579
00:41:48.84 --> 00:41:50.44
Meanwhile, this is how you do it.

580
00:41:50.44 --> 00:41:53.08
Apparently, mom and dad are doing it this way.

581
00:41:53.08 --> 00:41:54.08
That's the way it's done.

582
00:41:54.08 --> 00:41:55.08
We're going to do this.

583
00:41:55.08 --> 00:41:56.08
Yeah.

584
00:41:56.08 --> 00:42:03.52
You've got to do the right thing and people are watching you when you're in a leadership

585
00:42:03.52 --> 00:42:09.000
position, you are being watched, you are being emulated.

586
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.56
Your emotions are being mimicked.

587
00:42:10.56 --> 00:42:11.92
You don't know that.

588
00:42:11.92 --> 00:42:16.52
You might not sense that, but your emotions are being mimicked.

589
00:42:16.52 --> 00:42:17.76
You get into a panic mode.

590
00:42:17.76 --> 00:42:22.40
You're going to have a bunch of people panicking.

591
00:42:22.40 --> 00:42:24.40
You stay calm.

592
00:42:24.40 --> 00:42:26.32
Your people are going to stay calm.

593
00:42:26.32 --> 00:42:27.32
You get crazy.

594
00:42:27.32 --> 00:42:28.84
Your people are going to go crazy.

595
00:42:28.84 --> 00:42:31.60
Your people are watching you so set the good example.

596
00:42:31.60 --> 00:42:39.000
And one of the premier examples he's setting is he's maintaining the discipline.

597
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.84
Now this is actually section.

598
00:42:40.84 --> 00:42:49.28
I don't, it's, it's very interesting because we had, I had made a comment on the podcast

599
00:42:49.28 --> 00:42:50.76
about, hey, what do you do?

600
00:42:50.76 --> 00:42:54.40
Someone asked, what do you do if you get told to do something and you don't believe

601
00:42:54.40 --> 00:42:55.40
in it.

602
00:42:55.40 --> 00:42:56.40
Right.

603
00:42:56.40 --> 00:43:00.60
And you know, I went through a big gray area and said, look, there's some gray area

604
00:43:00.60 --> 00:43:01.60
there.

605
00:43:01.60 --> 00:43:05.16
And if it's just something small that you can ask to do and you just, if you decide

606
00:43:05.16 --> 00:43:08.44
you're going to lay down the wall right now and bang your fist on the table and say, I'm

607
00:43:08.44 --> 00:43:09.44
not going to do that.

608
00:43:09.44 --> 00:43:12.32
Well, then you're going to get fired.

609
00:43:12.32 --> 00:43:15.08
And now someone else is going to have to come in there and do that thing that you've

610
00:43:15.08 --> 00:43:16.44
been asked to do.

611
00:43:16.44 --> 00:43:20.32
And I had one person on Twitter that kind of went back and forth with me.

612
00:43:20.32 --> 00:43:26.40
And, you know, he said, hey, it does make an impact when you walk away.

613
00:43:26.40 --> 00:43:27.40
And I agreed with him.

614
00:43:27.40 --> 00:43:28.40
I said, yes, I know.

615
00:43:28.40 --> 00:43:31.44
I'm not trying to say it doesn't make an impact when you walk away because it certainly

616
00:43:31.44 --> 00:43:32.96
does.

617
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:42.48
But there's cases where it has more of an impact if you stay and you stay in the game.

618
00:43:42.48 --> 00:43:47.28
So this is an example right here, a pretty shocking example because we have a guy that's

619
00:43:47.28 --> 00:43:56.76
100% on board and is, you know, a street shooting guy that listens to his chain of command.

620
00:43:56.76 --> 00:43:59.60
Here's what happens.

621
00:43:59.60 --> 00:44:03.08
Colonel Bob Sink was a magnificent commander.

622
00:44:03.08 --> 00:44:08.08
But this time he had had a little too much to drink and is ordered to dispatch another

623
00:44:08.08 --> 00:44:13.48
patrol to capture additional prisoners did not make sense.

624
00:44:13.48 --> 00:44:16.92
We had already captured sufficient prisoners for interrogation.

625
00:44:16.92 --> 00:44:23.08
A second patrol would only result in casualties for no apparent reason.

626
00:44:23.08 --> 00:44:28.36
Either exacerbating the situation was freshly fallen snow along the river that had

627
00:44:28.36 --> 00:44:31.96
quickly turned to ice during the day.

628
00:44:31.96 --> 00:44:38.80
If I followed Colonel Sink's order, the enemy would have heard us coming a long way off.

629
00:44:38.80 --> 00:44:41.36
What to do?

630
00:44:41.36 --> 00:44:45.56
I responded, yes, sir.

631
00:44:45.56 --> 00:44:51.16
And then promptly ignored the order.

632
00:44:51.16 --> 00:44:56.68
So he's doing what I was basically, what I was saying.

633
00:44:56.68 --> 00:44:58.68
If he just said no sir, we're not going to do that.

634
00:44:58.68 --> 00:44:59.68
Guess what?

635
00:44:59.68 --> 00:45:03.28
He's going to get fired and now we're going to get someone else put in charge.

636
00:45:03.28 --> 00:45:06.76
And even if he doesn't get fired, he's hurting his reputation.

637
00:45:06.76 --> 00:45:09.08
So it's a bad situation.

638
00:45:09.08 --> 00:45:11.44
But what he decides to do is go, God, it's sir.

639
00:45:11.44 --> 00:45:12.92
We'll take care of it.

640
00:45:12.92 --> 00:45:16.84
And then he promptly ignores the order to now back to the book.

641
00:45:16.84 --> 00:45:21.68
To give the impression of compliance, however, I assembled the men in a building and told

642
00:45:21.68 --> 00:45:26.52
them we were not going to send out this patrol because I did not think it was feasible.

643
00:45:26.52 --> 00:45:32.44
I also informed them that my neck was in a news, if anyone ever said anything about it.

644
00:45:32.44 --> 00:45:35.60
With that, the men laid down and caught some much needed sleep.

645
00:45:35.60 --> 00:45:42.60
And I took the radio and adjusted mortar and artillery fire on my supposed objective.

646
00:45:42.60 --> 00:45:45.04
And here's his thoughts on it.

647
00:45:45.04 --> 00:45:51.04
On reflection, I did exactly the right thing and I have never had any regrets.

648
00:45:51.04 --> 00:45:53.80
There was insufficient time for preparation.

649
00:45:53.80 --> 00:46:00.04
The field to our front was wide open and I would have lost too many men for no purpose.

650
00:46:00.04 --> 00:46:04.88
I wonder what I would have done had I been a career officer concerned about my own

651
00:46:04.88 --> 00:46:07.04
future?

652
00:46:07.04 --> 00:46:10.56
Would I have compromised my beliefs?

653
00:46:10.56 --> 00:46:15.64
The deliberate disobedience of a lawful order by my commanding officer presented an ethical

654
00:46:15.64 --> 00:46:23.64
dilemma of the first magnitude.

655
00:46:23.64 --> 00:46:27.76
But you can see it's a guy who's staying on his principles.

656
00:46:27.76 --> 00:46:31.84
And his principles were to accomplish the mission, take care of his men and he's weighing

657
00:46:31.84 --> 00:46:32.84
those things out.

658
00:46:32.84 --> 00:46:35.000
Those things aren't black and white.

659
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.04
Those things are not black and white because you look at all the times he did do

660
00:46:40.04 --> 00:46:44.48
operations and missions and taskings where his guys got wounded and killed.

661
00:46:44.48 --> 00:46:45.76
But he saw what the purpose was.

662
00:46:45.76 --> 00:46:48.32
And now he sees something where there's no purpose and he says you know what?

663
00:46:48.32 --> 00:46:49.32
Not going to do it.

664
00:46:49.32 --> 00:46:50.84
But he doesn't tell the boss.

665
00:46:50.84 --> 00:46:53.56
He just does next to you.

666
00:46:53.56 --> 00:46:58.04
So there's stories of seals and Vietnam doing that.

667
00:46:58.04 --> 00:47:04.32
And I heard that from the Vietnam seals would tell me, hey, if they got directed to do something

668
00:47:04.32 --> 00:47:05.60
that they didn't think was a good mission.

669
00:47:05.60 --> 00:47:07.04
I've talked about this before.

670
00:47:07.04 --> 00:47:11.000
Oh, we're going to go. You want us to go three kilometers away and set up an ambush

671
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.76
on this river that's in really tough enemy control areas.

672
00:47:13.76 --> 00:47:16.76
And we don't know what the intelligence is on who's going to come down that river.

673
00:47:16.76 --> 00:47:18.24
Okay, cool.

674
00:47:18.24 --> 00:47:20.96
And they'd patrol 200 meters out the gate.

675
00:47:20.96 --> 00:47:26.04
Set up a little perimeter, right close to camp where there's no no problems, smoke a couple

676
00:47:26.04 --> 00:47:27.04
cigarettes.

677
00:47:27.04 --> 00:47:29.76
It's spent a few hours out there.

678
00:47:29.76 --> 00:47:30.76
Walk back.

679
00:47:30.76 --> 00:47:31.76
Yeah, hey, nothing happened.

680
00:47:31.76 --> 00:47:32.76
No one came down the river.

681
00:47:32.76 --> 00:47:35.76
I would think you'd have to be pretty responsible though.

682
00:47:35.76 --> 00:47:40.12
If you're going to kind of exercise that course of action, otherwise you get someone who's

683
00:47:40.12 --> 00:47:41.68
just like, no, don't feel like it.

684
00:47:41.68 --> 00:47:42.68
Don't feel like it.

685
00:47:42.68 --> 00:47:43.68
Yeah, no.

686
00:47:43.68 --> 00:47:46.24
It's obviously something that a guy like Dick Winner did very rarely.

687
00:47:46.24 --> 00:47:49.84
And the seals and Vietnam, something they were blown missions off all the time.

688
00:47:49.84 --> 00:47:56.44
But they, you know, like I said, if something comes up where you completely disagree with

689
00:47:56.44 --> 00:48:02.000
it, but you don't disagree with it to the point where you want to make a, you want to make

690
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.08
a stand that's going to make you get fired.

691
00:48:04.08 --> 00:48:06.36
Now you're not supporting your guys anymore.

692
00:48:06.36 --> 00:48:07.36
Yeah.

693
00:48:07.36 --> 00:48:08.36
Yeah.

694
00:48:08.36 --> 00:48:09.72
You know, okay, you kept them alive that night.

695
00:48:09.72 --> 00:48:12.08
Well, who's coming in to take your place?

696
00:48:12.08 --> 00:48:13.08
That's the question.

697
00:48:13.08 --> 00:48:14.08
Who's coming in to take your place?

698
00:48:14.08 --> 00:48:15.56
And you don't know who that is.

699
00:48:15.56 --> 00:48:18.52
And what's their best interest going to be?

700
00:48:18.52 --> 00:48:21.68
Because whoever comes in to take your place is going to be a company guy that's going to be

701
00:48:21.68 --> 00:48:27.40
he's going to be a guy that's going to obey every last direct order from the guy.

702
00:48:27.40 --> 00:48:28.96
And this is, you know, it's strange too.

703
00:48:28.96 --> 00:48:29.96
I mean, here I am.

704
00:48:29.96 --> 00:48:37.68
I mean, I was, as, as motivated it to be in the military as I could possibly be.

705
00:48:37.68 --> 00:48:42.36
You know, so I'm not sitting here calling from you, to from guys.

706
00:48:42.36 --> 00:48:44.52
But I am telling you to use common sense.

707
00:48:44.52 --> 00:48:47.28
And you've got to put common sense on top of everything.

708
00:48:47.28 --> 00:48:49.04
And sometimes common sense outweighs orders.

709
00:48:49.04 --> 00:48:50.60
That's just the way it is.

710
00:48:50.60 --> 00:48:51.60
It's rare.

711
00:48:51.60 --> 00:48:52.88
And I said this last time as well.

712
00:48:52.88 --> 00:48:53.88
It's rare.

713
00:48:53.88 --> 00:48:56.92
It's not like you're getting these crazy orders from up the chain of command.

714
00:48:56.92 --> 00:49:01.04
People aren't people aren't advancing in the military because they're idiots.

715
00:49:01.04 --> 00:49:02.04
Right.

716
00:49:02.04 --> 00:49:03.04
Yeah.

717
00:49:03.04 --> 00:49:04.04
And it's not like they're not on your team.

718
00:49:04.04 --> 00:49:06.48
And it's not like they want you to get killed.

719
00:49:06.48 --> 00:49:10.56
And you know, maybe, you know, in this case, he could have given some pushback and said,

720
00:49:10.56 --> 00:49:12.44
hey, you know what, boss here's what's going on.

721
00:49:12.44 --> 00:49:13.44
There's fresh snow.

722
00:49:13.44 --> 00:49:14.84
It's good they're going to hear us coming in a mile away.

723
00:49:14.84 --> 00:49:16.92
We don't have good cover to the front.

724
00:49:16.92 --> 00:49:19.72
This is not a good operation.

725
00:49:19.72 --> 00:49:25.28
But maybe he heard the tone of the Colonel's voice and just said, hey, if I say that, and

726
00:49:25.28 --> 00:49:28.64
then I don't do it, or if I say that, it's going to make me suspicious.

727
00:49:28.64 --> 00:49:30.44
So you know what, I got it, sir.

728
00:49:30.44 --> 00:49:32.000
And then don't do it.

729
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.40
Just a judge, a judgment of character.

730
00:49:36.40 --> 00:49:39.16
But that's what you've got writing on you and your in a leadership position.

731
00:49:39.16 --> 00:49:41.72
You got those guys' lives.

732
00:49:41.72 --> 00:49:44.68
And that should be more important than anything.

733
00:49:44.68 --> 00:49:52.56
And it's a strange dichotomy of leadership because on the one hand, you're trained

734
00:49:52.56 --> 00:49:59.48
your whole military career that you got to take care of your men, take care of your people.

735
00:49:59.48 --> 00:50:04.80
That's something you get trained on since day one, take care of your team.

736
00:50:04.80 --> 00:50:08.28
And the dichotomy of that is you're going to do missions where you could very well

737
00:50:08.28 --> 00:50:09.92
be sending your men to their death.

738
00:50:09.92 --> 00:50:12.96
So there's a massive dichotomy there.

739
00:50:12.96 --> 00:50:14.28
And how do you deal with the dichotomy?

740
00:50:14.28 --> 00:50:16.48
You find the balance.

741
00:50:16.48 --> 00:50:21.48
And the balance is not a cookie cutter response.

742
00:50:21.48 --> 00:50:25.32
The balance is different for each scenario that you're in.

743
00:50:25.32 --> 00:50:33.96
And how well you can weigh those opposing forces is a measure of what kind of leader you

744
00:50:33.96 --> 00:50:36.48
are.

745
00:50:36.48 --> 00:50:40.60
That's what makes leadership hard.

746
00:50:40.60 --> 00:50:57.16
Now we're getting to move through Europe and now we're about to go from war to something

747
00:50:57.16 --> 00:51:04.40
even more evil, which is the concentration camps, the death camps.

748
00:51:04.40 --> 00:51:07.36
So back to the book.

749
00:51:07.36 --> 00:51:11.88
Because they enter, this is back to the book, as they enter the death camps for the first

750
00:51:11.88 --> 00:51:14.32
time.

751
00:51:14.32 --> 00:51:20.72
The horror of what we observe remains with each paratrooper to this day.

752
00:51:20.72 --> 00:51:22.64
You could not explain it.

753
00:51:22.64 --> 00:51:24.64
You could not describe it.

754
00:51:24.64 --> 00:51:27.68
And you could not exaggerate it.

755
00:51:27.68 --> 00:51:33.56
It did not take long to realize that the Nazis were intent on eliminating all the Jews,

756
00:51:33.56 --> 00:51:39.000
the Nazis, and anyone who disagreed with Hitler's regime.

757
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.28
The memory of starved, dazed men who dropped their eyes and heads and looked at them through

758
00:51:44.28 --> 00:51:49.80
the chain-link fence in the same manner that a beaten mystery to dog would cringe.

759
00:51:49.80 --> 00:51:54.52
Left a mark on all of us forever.

760
00:51:54.52 --> 00:52:01.28
Nor could you underestimate the barbarity of the Nazi regime, even during the latter stages

761
00:52:01.28 --> 00:52:05.76
of the war.

762
00:52:05.76 --> 00:52:13.24
As I went through the war, it was natural to ask myself, why am I here?

763
00:52:13.24 --> 00:52:19.60
Why am I putting up with a freezing cold, the constant rain, and the loss of so many comrades?

764
00:52:19.60 --> 00:52:22.08
Does anybody care?

765
00:52:22.08 --> 00:52:30.08
A soldier faces death on a daily basis, and his life is one of misery and deprivation.

766
00:52:30.08 --> 00:52:36.92
He is cold, he suffers from hunger frequently bordering on starvation.

767
00:52:36.92 --> 00:52:44.56
The impact of seeing those people behind that fence left me saying, if only to myself,

768
00:52:44.56 --> 00:52:47.84
now I know why I am here.

769
00:52:47.84 --> 00:52:55.84
For the first time, I understand what this war is all about.

770
00:52:55.84 --> 00:53:02.68
And obviously seeing that evil firsthand.

771
00:53:02.68 --> 00:53:10.12
That's one of the reasons why I think we explore the darkness and the evil on a fairly regular

772
00:53:10.12 --> 00:53:12.96
basis here.

773
00:53:12.96 --> 00:53:14.44
That's why I explore it.

774
00:53:14.44 --> 00:53:19.48
That's why my mind is drawn to these things because you've got to understand that

775
00:53:19.48 --> 00:53:30.92
evil is out there, and it's still here today, and somebody has got to take the fight

776
00:53:30.92 --> 00:53:37.20
to the enemy.

777
00:53:37.20 --> 00:53:44.92
Now I'm jumping towards the end of the book, and again, it's not really not given anything

778
00:53:44.92 --> 00:53:45.92
away.

779
00:53:45.92 --> 00:53:54.48
It's not allowed World War II ended, but this is how winter, or sorry, major winter is

780
00:53:54.48 --> 00:54:02.60
kind of wraps up their combat back to the book.

781
00:54:02.60 --> 00:54:09.84
And so many of the co-avadrins returned home, yet all would be forever connected by their

782
00:54:09.84 --> 00:54:13.52
shared experiences in combat.

783
00:54:13.52 --> 00:54:20.52
The course of the war, easy company alone, lost 48 men killed, and over 100 wounded,

784
00:54:20.52 --> 00:54:25.12
incurring 150% casualties.

785
00:54:25.12 --> 00:54:30.76
This percentage was not uncommon among similar units who had fought in the campaign of Northwest

786
00:54:30.76 --> 00:54:33.36
Europe.

787
00:54:33.36 --> 00:54:39.56
At the peak of its effectiveness in Holland in October of 1944, and in the R-Dens in January

788
00:54:39.56 --> 00:54:47.32
1945, it was as good a rifle company as there was in the world, according to Arthur Steven

789
00:54:47.32 --> 00:54:49.48
E. Ambrose.

790
00:54:49.48 --> 00:54:56.08
How so many men survived the campaigns in Normandy, Holland, Bastone, and Germany was a true

791
00:54:56.08 --> 00:55:05.08
testament to their courage, their training, and their discipline under fire.

792
00:55:05.08 --> 00:55:12.40
And now I want to fast forward a little bit more to...

793
00:55:12.40 --> 00:55:14.68
He's done.

794
00:55:14.68 --> 00:55:18.44
He's now out of the military, and I know we got a lot of people that listened to the

795
00:55:18.44 --> 00:55:23.32
show, because a lot of you guys reached out to me, and talk about that transition, a lot

796
00:55:23.32 --> 00:55:32.96
of people asked me about that transition, and here's Dick Winter's transition.

797
00:55:32.96 --> 00:55:38.80
While I was extremely happy to put the army behind me, I realized that I was a different

798
00:55:38.80 --> 00:55:44.24
man than I was when I joined the army over four years earlier.

799
00:55:44.24 --> 00:55:51.72
The war had changed me in many ways, as it does all who experience combat.

800
00:55:51.72 --> 00:55:57.80
Having witnessed so much mass suffering, and the unparalleled barbarism that mankind is

801
00:55:57.80 --> 00:56:01.76
capable of inflicting upon itself.

802
00:56:01.76 --> 00:56:09.80
I don't see how any survivor can be ever be cruel to anything again.

803
00:56:09.80 --> 00:56:16.48
In addition, I was a far better judge of character than I had been in 1941.

804
00:56:16.48 --> 00:56:21.24
That feeling remains with me today a full 60 years after the war.

805
00:56:21.24 --> 00:56:25.08
When I meet people for the first time and get to know them, I can't help but judge them

806
00:56:25.08 --> 00:56:27.08
and size them up.

807
00:56:27.08 --> 00:56:28.72
Do they have leadership?

808
00:56:28.72 --> 00:56:31.72
Would they be good in combat?

809
00:56:31.72 --> 00:56:36.000
Do they pass the test?

810
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.48
I was also more disciplined than I remembered being before I deployed to Europe.

811
00:56:43.48 --> 00:56:49.40
This discipline helped me adapt to civilian life once I returned to Pennsylvania.

812
00:56:49.40 --> 00:56:54.12
Like all veterans, I had to adjust to society, the life that you were going to share

813
00:56:54.12 --> 00:56:57.56
with others in order to make a living.

814
00:56:57.56 --> 00:57:03.36
I certainly never confused the challenges in the workplace with what I experienced in combat.

815
00:57:03.36 --> 00:57:07.64
There would be no life and death struggles in the corporate world.

816
00:57:07.64 --> 00:57:10.92
Business hardly equates to war.

817
00:57:10.92 --> 00:57:15.44
Such comparisons demean the word.

818
00:57:15.44 --> 00:57:20.40
When I read that, I actually had to put myself into check.

819
00:57:20.40 --> 00:57:24.000
I wanted to make sure that I'm clear about something.

820
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:33.32
And obviously we wrote a book that's about comparing business and war.

821
00:57:33.32 --> 00:57:38.08
But I want to make it clear that what we're comparing and what we say is similar.

822
00:57:38.08 --> 00:57:45.64
In fact, they're the same is that principles, the principles of leadership are the same.

823
00:57:45.64 --> 00:57:49.88
The struggles and the challenges and the consequences are not the same.

824
00:57:49.88 --> 00:57:53.48
They are not.

825
00:57:53.48 --> 00:57:59.48
So I want to make sure I make that clear.

826
00:57:59.48 --> 00:58:10.48
Now, what's get to some of his reflections on leadership?

827
00:58:10.48 --> 00:58:11.96
Back to the book.

828
00:58:11.96 --> 00:58:14.72
Was I a successful leader?

829
00:58:14.72 --> 00:58:19.48
They tell me I was and modesty prevents me from disagreeing with them.

830
00:58:19.48 --> 00:58:24.48
I am not so naive that I don't realize the wide appeal of dick winners today as based

831
00:58:24.48 --> 00:58:27.40
on leadership in combat.

832
00:58:27.40 --> 00:58:33.24
I may not have been the best commander, but I always strove to be.

833
00:58:33.24 --> 00:58:38.88
My men depended on me to carefully analyze every tactical situation to maximize the resources

834
00:58:38.88 --> 00:58:45.68
that I had at my disposal to think under pressure and delete them by personal example.

835
00:58:45.68 --> 00:58:50.68
I think it's interesting, even here, you know, he's looking back and he's a humble guy.

836
00:58:50.68 --> 00:58:56.24
You know, I may have not been the best combat commander, but I always tried to be.

837
00:58:56.24 --> 00:58:58.72
This is a humble man.

838
00:58:58.72 --> 00:59:03.60
I am not sure there is such a thing as a natural born leader.

839
00:59:03.60 --> 00:59:07.52
Some leaders are born with special aptitudes or talents.

840
00:59:07.52 --> 00:59:13.000
But any success I might have had was the product of good upbringing, intense study and

841
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:19.000
preparation and physical conditioning that set me apart from my peers.

842
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Here's dick winners.

843
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:27.96
I mean, one of the best kind of combat leaders at the tactical level in the modern era.

844
00:59:27.96 --> 00:59:32.20
And he's saying that it was preparation and physical conditioning, setting him apart from

845
00:59:32.20 --> 00:59:33.92
his peers.

846
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:35.16
I was all back the book.

847
00:59:35.16 --> 00:59:39.80
I was also surrounded by a group of men who were disciplined and highly trained to accomplish

848
00:59:39.80 --> 00:59:41.96
any mission.

849
00:59:41.96 --> 00:59:45.76
I'd love to the equation and you can understand that the secret to my success was that

850
00:59:45.76 --> 00:59:50.60
somehow I always managed to survive another day.

851
00:59:50.60 --> 00:59:55.80
In recent years, I've been asked to address an increasing number of civic groups, corporate

852
00:59:55.80 --> 01:00:02.48
seminars, and governmental agencies on the subject of leadership.

853
01:00:02.48 --> 01:00:10.40
Most are looking for cookie cutter solutions as to what constitutes a successful leader.

854
01:00:10.40 --> 01:00:12.64
What is the recipe for success?

855
01:00:12.64 --> 01:00:14.88
And this is classic.

856
01:00:14.88 --> 01:00:25.08
And actually when the book came out, we did a bunch of interviews that got turned into either

857
01:00:25.08 --> 01:00:28.08
short articles or video clips.

858
01:00:28.08 --> 01:00:30.12
And they title these things.

859
01:00:30.12 --> 01:00:32.68
Like three things every leader must do.

860
01:00:32.68 --> 01:00:34.16
And that's what they always do.

861
01:00:34.16 --> 01:00:36.68
Everyone's looking exactly for what he says.

862
01:00:36.68 --> 01:00:42.20
They start looking for cookie cutter solutions to what constitutes a successful leader.

863
01:00:42.20 --> 01:00:45.20
What is the recipe for success?

864
01:00:45.20 --> 01:00:49.08
In truth, there are no simple solutions.

865
01:00:49.08 --> 01:00:53.000
Just as there is no average day in combat.

866
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.76
Each situation is different.

867
01:00:54.76 --> 01:01:00.12
And each requires a leader to be flexible in adapting his or her particular leadership style

868
01:01:00.12 --> 01:01:05.48
to the specific circumstances required to accomplish any mission.

869
01:01:05.48 --> 01:01:10.52
It's a matter of adjusting to the individual and you do this every day.

870
01:01:10.52 --> 01:01:13.48
You don't have just one way of treating people.

871
01:01:13.48 --> 01:01:20.76
You adjust yourself to whom you are talking.

872
01:01:20.76 --> 01:01:25.52
If I would give advice to a young leader going to war based on my observation of what

873
01:01:25.52 --> 01:01:30.80
I had constituted the success of the outstanding leaders who comprised the American parachute

874
01:01:30.80 --> 01:01:35.28
infantry regiment of World War II, I would offer a series of principles that I am

875
01:01:35.28 --> 01:01:40.40
certain would result in great success regardless of the field endeavor, field of endeavor

876
01:01:40.40 --> 01:01:42.40
in which the individual was participating.

877
01:01:42.40 --> 01:01:46.76
So here he's saying the same thing that I said, which is leadership is the same, whether

878
01:01:46.76 --> 01:01:50.80
it's in the battlefield or whatever endeavor you're going into, leadership principles

879
01:01:50.80 --> 01:01:53.44
stay the same.

880
01:01:53.44 --> 01:02:00.68
First and foremost, a leader should strive to be an individual of flawless character,

881
01:02:00.68 --> 01:02:05.48
physical competence and moral courage.

882
01:02:05.48 --> 01:02:09.92
If you have character, that means you are the guy, that means the guy you are dealing

883
01:02:09.92 --> 01:02:13.28
with can trust you.

884
01:02:13.28 --> 01:02:19.40
The men trust you have faith in you and they obey you no questions asked.

885
01:02:19.40 --> 01:02:22.04
That's character in a nutshell.

886
01:02:22.04 --> 01:02:26.88
Character also allows you to make decisions quickly and correctly.

887
01:02:26.88 --> 01:02:31.52
One may question my decision to disobey a direct order from my commanding officer.

888
01:02:31.52 --> 01:02:34.72
This is the story we already talked about.

889
01:02:34.72 --> 01:02:41.12
And to fake another patrol as a violation of that very principle I'm advocating.

890
01:02:41.12 --> 01:02:46.40
In my heart, however, I could not send my men to risk their lives for no apparent reason

891
01:02:46.40 --> 01:02:51.24
when clearly nothing would have been gained that we had not already achieved.

892
01:02:51.24 --> 01:02:57.24
Such a course takes a degree of moral courage, which I have found is far rather than physical

893
01:02:57.24 --> 01:02:58.48
courage.

894
01:02:58.48 --> 01:03:00.08
Was I correct?

895
01:03:00.08 --> 01:03:06.76
In my estimation, I fought so and I have never regretted my decision.

896
01:03:06.76 --> 01:03:10.56
The same holds true for developing leaders of competency.

897
01:03:10.56 --> 01:03:15.72
Those entrusted to lead must study their profession to become totally proficient in tactics

898
01:03:15.72 --> 01:03:17.92
and technology.

899
01:03:17.92 --> 01:03:22.60
Prior to the invasion, I read every tactical manual I could lay my hands on to improve

900
01:03:22.60 --> 01:03:27.12
my tactical knowledge and professional competence while other soldiers were out curousing

901
01:03:27.12 --> 01:03:29.28
in the pubs.

902
01:03:29.28 --> 01:03:33.44
While they were enjoying the social life of the neighboring towns, I was reading and educating

903
01:03:33.44 --> 01:03:41.64
myself, getting ready to lead men into combat.

904
01:03:41.64 --> 01:03:43.64
Getting smarter.

905
01:03:43.64 --> 01:03:44.64
Open it up the books.

906
01:03:44.64 --> 01:03:46.88
That's what he was doing.

907
01:03:46.88 --> 01:03:47.88
And that's part of leadership.

908
01:03:47.88 --> 01:03:55.36
That's part of his characteristics of leadership is to become knowledgeable to read and

909
01:03:55.36 --> 01:03:59.60
study.

910
01:03:59.60 --> 01:04:00.60
He goes on.

911
01:04:00.60 --> 01:04:03.96
Don't waste time attempting to define leadership.

912
01:04:03.96 --> 01:04:06.20
No need to go to a dictionary.

913
01:04:06.20 --> 01:04:11.32
The infantry school at Fort Benning, Georgia has defined leadership in just two words via

914
01:04:11.32 --> 01:04:19.60
its motto, follow me.

915
01:04:19.60 --> 01:04:24.92
And he's going to do it again right here.

916
01:04:24.92 --> 01:04:28.32
Physical fitness is another prerequisite for success.

917
01:04:28.32 --> 01:04:32.64
I freely admit that I was blessed with a sound physical constitution but whenever possible

918
01:04:32.64 --> 01:04:37.12
I took the opportunity to improve my physical stamina.

919
01:04:37.12 --> 01:04:41.52
As I was in such good physical shape, I easily survived to coa.

920
01:04:41.52 --> 01:04:44.96
That's their initial training that they went through for airborne.

921
01:04:44.96 --> 01:04:49.32
While men washed out on a daily basis, the contingent from easy company that completed

922
01:04:49.32 --> 01:04:54.000
the training and earned their wings at Fort Benning were tough as nails.

923
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.24
Because I was in such good shape, my fatigue level never reached the point of physical

924
01:04:59.24 --> 01:05:04.68
exhaustion that contributes to mental exhaustion and ultimately to combat fatigue.

925
01:05:04.68 --> 01:05:08.64
We all experience sleep deprivation at times.

926
01:05:08.64 --> 01:05:10.60
That is the nature of stress.

927
01:05:10.60 --> 01:05:20.04
But a physically exhausted leader routinely makes poor decisions in times of crisis.

928
01:05:20.04 --> 01:05:26.40
And here he talks about another piece.

929
01:05:26.40 --> 01:05:31.56
I have always felt that my principal contribution to the success of both easy company and

930
01:05:31.56 --> 01:05:39.84
second battalion was based on my knowledge of what to expect from each man.

931
01:05:39.84 --> 01:05:43.16
Know your people.

932
01:05:43.16 --> 01:05:48.64
Having selected the right men for the right job, I then delegated the authority to my

933
01:05:48.64 --> 01:05:55.000
subordinates and allowed them to use their initiative to execute the mission.

934
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.52
Decentralized command.

935
01:05:57.52 --> 01:06:03.44
There is no need to tell someone how to do his job if you have properly trained your

936
01:06:03.44 --> 01:06:09.04
team.

937
01:06:09.04 --> 01:06:13.60
Good preparation is always vital to the success of any operation.

938
01:06:13.60 --> 01:06:19.28
But leaders must remain flexible once the action commences.

939
01:06:19.28 --> 01:06:24.48
Steve Ambrose likes to quote general Eisenhower who claimed before the battle is joined,

940
01:06:24.48 --> 01:06:26.72
plans or everything.

941
01:06:26.72 --> 01:06:36.000
Once the battle is joined, however plans go out the window.

942
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.32
Next I would encourage leaders to take a moment of self reflection before rushing into

943
01:06:41.32 --> 01:06:44.32
important decisions.

944
01:06:44.32 --> 01:06:47.92
This is a little bit of detachment.

945
01:06:47.92 --> 01:06:51.96
Many leaders don't take the time to consider carefully their decisions or the implications

946
01:06:51.96 --> 01:06:54.32
of their actions.

947
01:06:54.32 --> 01:07:02.76
In battle, I periodically detached myself mentally from the noises and the chaos of battle.

948
01:07:02.76 --> 01:07:08.32
I found it useful to separate myself momentarily and to carefully think through what actions

949
01:07:08.32 --> 01:07:11.92
I needed to take to accomplish the mission.

950
01:07:11.92 --> 01:07:16.88
Again, I read this book for the first time last week.

951
01:07:16.88 --> 01:07:18.64
He's saying detachment straight up.

952
01:07:18.64 --> 01:07:23.84
He's saying the exact same in battle, I periodically detached myself mentally from the noises

953
01:07:23.84 --> 01:07:27.12
and chaos of battle.

954
01:07:27.12 --> 01:07:29.28
Hang tough.

955
01:07:29.28 --> 01:07:34.12
Never, ever give up regardless of the adversity.

956
01:07:34.12 --> 01:07:42.84
If you are a leader, a fellow who other fellows look to, you have got to keep going.

957
01:07:42.84 --> 01:07:49.36
I would also urge leaders to remain humble.

958
01:07:49.36 --> 01:07:55.24
If you don't worry about who gets the credit, you get a lot more done.

959
01:07:55.24 --> 01:07:58.76
Again, this is when people ask me what's the most important quality of a leader.

960
01:07:58.76 --> 01:08:01.40
I tell them that humility.

961
01:08:01.40 --> 01:08:08.16
Leaders should assume the blame when the operation fails.

962
01:08:08.16 --> 01:08:12.68
When it succeeds, credit the men and women in your team.

963
01:08:12.68 --> 01:08:16.04
They do the lion's share of the work.

964
01:08:16.04 --> 01:08:19.92
And now he's going to talk about humility a little bit more.

965
01:08:19.92 --> 01:08:25.88
Since the release of the HBO miniseries, many of us have been flooded with hundreds, sometimes

966
01:08:25.88 --> 01:08:31.64
thousands of letters from adoring fans across the nation.

967
01:08:31.64 --> 01:08:37.64
The attention is certainly flattering and greatly appreciated.

968
01:08:37.64 --> 01:08:44.44
But it remains better to remember Eisenhower's address at Guild Hall Hall on June 12,

969
01:08:44.44 --> 01:08:53.40
1945, to an ecstatic British public, which showered the Supreme Commander with a tumultuous

970
01:08:53.40 --> 01:08:56.48
parade through the streets of London.

971
01:08:56.48 --> 01:09:01.84
I commanded them.

972
01:09:01.84 --> 01:09:09.56
Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives a claim earned in the blood of

973
01:09:09.56 --> 01:09:17.40
his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.

974
01:09:17.40 --> 01:09:25.000
I think anybody that's ever been in a leadership position and has been called some kind

975
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.32
of hero will think back to that statement.

976
01:09:29.32 --> 01:09:35.000
Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives a claim earned in the blood

977
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:44.52
of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.

978
01:09:44.52 --> 01:09:53.76
And I think when you use that word hero, it's something that obviously gets thrown

979
01:09:53.76 --> 01:09:59.000
around a lot.

980
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:07.40
And here's what Major Winners had to say about that, perhaps the best characterization

981
01:10:07.40 --> 01:10:16.28
of what a true hero consists is found in a letter, Sergeant Mike Rainy sent me in January

982
01:10:16.28 --> 01:10:22.08
1982, surely before he went back to the hospital for a series of tests.

983
01:10:22.08 --> 01:10:26.76
Historians Stephen Ambrose used the passage to conclude band of brothers because Rainy

984
01:10:26.76 --> 01:10:33.56
encapsulated the cohesion that became the hallmark of easy company.

985
01:10:33.56 --> 01:10:40.000
In thinking back on the days of easy company, I'm treasuring my remark to a grandson who

986
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.44
asked grandpa, were you a hero in the war?

987
01:10:47.44 --> 01:10:54.08
No, I answered, but I served in a company of heroes.

988
01:10:54.08 --> 01:11:02.56
And I can tell you that I also served with many, many heroes, the guys in tasking to bruiser

989
01:11:02.56 --> 01:11:07.44
the guys from 2 to 8 infantry, the guys from 1-1-AD and the ready first, the soldiers and

990
01:11:07.44 --> 01:11:19.64
the Marines, all those brave men.

991
01:11:19.64 --> 01:11:26.44
And some brave women as well.

992
01:11:26.44 --> 01:11:32.12
And to those men and women, those soldiers and Marines that I was lucky enough to serve

993
01:11:32.12 --> 01:11:42.12
with, I think that this statement right here from Dick Winners is something that I think

994
01:11:42.12 --> 01:11:46.52
is very fitting.

995
01:11:46.52 --> 01:11:52.72
As I look back on the men of easy company and the closeness we have enjoyed over the years,

996
01:11:52.72 --> 01:11:58.16
I reminded of the dialogue attributed to a senior German officer bidding farewell to his men

997
01:11:58.16 --> 01:12:02.20
in the HBO miniseries.

998
01:12:02.20 --> 01:12:09.08
Paraphrasing his words, I would say to easy company and the officers in men of the 506

999
01:12:09.08 --> 01:12:12.84
parachute infantry regiment.

1000
01:12:12.84 --> 01:12:16.28
It has been a long war.

1001
01:12:16.28 --> 01:12:21.28
It's been a hard war.

1002
01:12:21.28 --> 01:12:26.000
You have fought bravely, proudly for your country.

1003
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:33.04
You are a special group of men connected by a bond that only exists in combat.

1004
01:12:33.04 --> 01:12:39.52
You've shared the in-communicable experience of war and have been tested under extreme

1005
01:12:39.52 --> 01:12:41.80
adversity.

1006
01:12:41.80 --> 01:12:47.56
You've shared foxholes and have held each other in dire moments.

1007
01:12:47.56 --> 01:12:51.96
You've seen death and have suffered together.

1008
01:12:51.96 --> 01:13:00.16
You've lived in an environment totally incomprehensible to those who do not know war.

1009
01:13:00.16 --> 01:13:06.64
I am proud and deeply honored to have served with every one of you.

1010
01:13:06.64 --> 01:13:12.56
You all deserve long and happy lives in peace.

1011
01:13:12.56 --> 01:13:18.52
I bid each of you God's speed and ask the Almighty to shower his blessings on you and your

1012
01:13:18.52 --> 01:13:24.96
families now and for generations to come.

1013
01:13:24.96 --> 01:13:34.96
And that wraps the book and, you know, I was thinking after the last podcast that this

1014
01:13:34.96 --> 01:13:39.52
was going to be a lighter one.

1015
01:13:39.52 --> 01:13:47.12
And I picked this book specifically because I see major dick winners as an incredible person,

1016
01:13:47.12 --> 01:13:53.68
incredible leader, a role model for everyone.

1017
01:13:53.68 --> 01:14:04.92
But because we are talking about war, there is still tragedy and loss and darkness there.

1018
01:14:04.92 --> 01:14:12.84
And that's okay.

1019
01:14:12.84 --> 01:14:22.20
And do you vet out there like the anonymous Marine that wrote that tribute to his brothers

1020
01:14:22.20 --> 01:14:26.44
from April 2nd?

1021
01:14:26.44 --> 01:14:31.48
And we know there's hundreds of thousands of veterans that are feeling that every day.

1022
01:14:31.48 --> 01:14:42.88
If you're having one of those dark days, it's okay.

1023
01:14:42.88 --> 01:14:49.80
It's okay.

1024
01:14:49.80 --> 01:14:56.36
It's okay to feel that darkness.

1025
01:14:56.36 --> 01:15:04.64
It's okay to remember it and miss it and hate it and love it.

1026
01:15:04.64 --> 01:15:08.92
And it's okay to wish it never happened.

1027
01:15:08.92 --> 01:15:15.60
And at the same time, to wish it never stopped.

1028
01:15:15.60 --> 01:15:21.40
And it's okay to want to take it all back.

1029
01:15:21.40 --> 01:15:31.52
And at the same time, to want to do it all again.

1030
01:15:31.52 --> 01:15:43.48
And if you've got in your mind that you think that people don't understand, that's okay.

1031
01:15:43.48 --> 01:15:46.92
They don't.

1032
01:15:46.92 --> 01:15:50.64
But you do.

1033
01:15:50.64 --> 01:15:57.08
You know darkness, you know evil.

1034
01:15:57.08 --> 01:16:01.76
But more important than that.

1035
01:16:01.76 --> 01:16:06.20
You know good.

1036
01:16:06.20 --> 01:16:10.72
You know light.

1037
01:16:10.72 --> 01:16:20.72
You know laughter and love better than anyone.

1038
01:16:20.72 --> 01:16:29.48
So embrace.

1039
01:16:29.48 --> 01:16:31.76
Embrace that darkness.

1040
01:16:31.76 --> 01:16:32.76
Own it.

1041
01:16:32.76 --> 01:16:34.40
Don't look away from it.

1042
01:16:34.40 --> 01:16:39.16
Don't bury it in booze or in pills.

1043
01:16:39.16 --> 01:16:42.16
Listen.

1044
01:16:42.16 --> 01:16:49.72
Listen to what corporal Scott Procopio would have been saying to you, live your life.

1045
01:16:49.72 --> 01:16:59.68
Embrace your life with physical activity and with nature and with you jutsu and with

1046
01:16:59.68 --> 01:17:10.84
son and with laughter and guitar and good memories and creativity and discipline.

1047
01:17:10.84 --> 01:17:15.68
Discipline yourself.

1048
01:17:15.68 --> 01:17:29.64
So you can free yourself and move forward into the future.

1049
01:17:29.64 --> 01:17:34.88
Whether there's no more darkness and no more war.

1050
01:17:34.88 --> 01:17:40.20
But peace.

1051
01:17:40.20 --> 01:17:42.52
Good evening, Echo.

1052
01:17:42.52 --> 01:17:47.24
Good evening.

1053
01:17:47.24 --> 01:17:49.40
Little message to the vets out there.

1054
01:17:49.40 --> 01:17:56.64
I hear from a lot of veterans and I just want to let those guys know, you know, kind of

1055
01:17:56.64 --> 01:18:03.64
where I'm coming from, get a lot of real positive stuff from guys and let some guys go

1056
01:18:03.64 --> 01:18:13.76
with you hard times and I know it and you know, I'm hoping to be able to kind of spread

1057
01:18:13.76 --> 01:18:23.68
my thoughts where I'm at and how what I think of these things.

1058
01:18:23.68 --> 01:18:32.24
Because you know, if you get guys like major winners that you know did everything that

1059
01:18:32.24 --> 01:18:38.20
he did in war, he came back and you know, he was able to figure it out and a lot of

1060
01:18:38.20 --> 01:18:42.48
those veterans were and they, you know, he said, wasn't an easy adaptation that they

1061
01:18:42.48 --> 01:18:46.56
made but they made it.

1062
01:18:46.56 --> 01:18:49.80
They made it.

1063
01:18:49.80 --> 01:19:00.32
So I think you got to embrace those things and be stronger than them.

1064
01:19:00.32 --> 01:19:03.64
And I know and I said all the time, you got to know that darkness and you really want

1065
01:19:03.64 --> 01:19:11.08
to appreciate the light and I think that guys that have been to war, they can do that

1066
01:19:11.08 --> 01:19:17.44
and life can seem so much better.

1067
01:19:17.44 --> 01:19:23.92
You know how bad it can be.

1068
01:19:23.92 --> 01:19:38.32
So speaking of feedback from people, rough transition right now, but that's what we do here.

1069
01:19:38.32 --> 01:19:41.000
What rough transition?

1070
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Rough transitions.

1071
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And you know what?

1072
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.56
You know what's interesting about the rough transitions?

1073
01:19:44.56 --> 01:19:47.76
And any movement that's out there that's listening to me right now or anybody that's not

1074
01:19:47.76 --> 01:19:53.80
a vet that anyone that's been through hard times and loss, it's a big rough transition

1075
01:19:53.80 --> 01:19:56.68
and you go in and out emotionally.

1076
01:19:56.68 --> 01:20:00.36
And you know, you'll be feeling like crap one minute and then the next minute you'll feel

1077
01:20:00.36 --> 01:20:04.64
okay and you'll be laughing and that's, that's like I said, that's okay.

1078
01:20:04.64 --> 01:20:12.08
I think a lot of people are scared that they might be acting the wrong way.

1079
01:20:12.08 --> 01:20:15.08
But it's all right.

1080
01:20:15.08 --> 01:20:16.08
It's okay.

1081
01:20:16.08 --> 01:20:20.84
Yeah, and just like how you're saying where it may seem like people don't understand

1082
01:20:20.84 --> 01:20:26.20
and that's okay because they don't, that's so true because in this way, I think of it

1083
01:20:26.20 --> 01:20:32.60
because my best friends are actually they're still in, maybe seals.

1084
01:20:32.60 --> 01:20:34.56
So these are guys that you grow up with.

1085
01:20:34.56 --> 01:20:39.44
Grow up with and spend your best friends there in my wedding.

1086
01:20:39.44 --> 01:20:42.40
So a lot of them do you don't want to talk to them and stuff?

1087
01:20:42.40 --> 01:20:47.48
I just in my own head I kind of imagine what it's like coming back.

1088
01:20:47.48 --> 01:20:51.16
So if you kind of consider it kind of in a nutshell where you consider, hey, what's your

1089
01:20:51.16 --> 01:20:54.68
biggest problems when you're overseas, when you're in the war?

1090
01:20:54.68 --> 01:20:56.88
What are these big problems you gotta worry about?

1091
01:20:56.88 --> 01:21:02.000
Okay, and then let's factor that in okay, then we come home and then look okay, let's

1092
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.24
say in the where your biggest problem is getting shot and die.

1093
01:21:05.24 --> 01:21:12.24
Are you getting both your legs blown off or whatever?

1094
01:21:12.24 --> 01:21:16.20
Whatever your biggest problem is as far as worrying about.

1095
01:21:16.20 --> 01:21:20.76
Okay, then you come home and on and on your girlfriend or your wife is like, hey, I thought

1096
01:21:20.76 --> 01:21:24.56
I told you to do those dishes and she's flipping out on you.

1097
01:21:24.56 --> 01:21:29.32
So in the back of your mind, you're kind of like okay, wait, the comparison, it was two days

1098
01:21:29.32 --> 01:21:30.32
ago.

1099
01:21:30.32 --> 01:21:32.24
I was in the desert worried about my legs being blown off.

1100
01:21:32.24 --> 01:21:37.32
And now I'm here, we're apparently the biggest problem according to my girlfriend's

1101
01:21:37.32 --> 01:21:38.32
life.

1102
01:21:38.32 --> 01:21:39.68
The biggest problem on earth.

1103
01:21:39.68 --> 01:21:42.72
Apparently because she's the only one she's really met, she's met.

1104
01:21:42.72 --> 01:21:45.44
She won't really talk to me or the dishes, yeah.

1105
01:21:45.44 --> 01:21:47.56
And it's just not computing, you know?

1106
01:21:47.56 --> 01:21:51.84
And then you go next door and their biggest problem is kind on the same level.

1107
01:21:51.84 --> 01:21:53.48
So yeah, they don't understand.

1108
01:21:53.48 --> 01:21:59.12
And you in a way you're living in this crazy world where I can see how that could kind

1109
01:21:59.12 --> 01:22:02.92
of get to you and be like, man, am I wrong?

1110
01:22:02.92 --> 01:22:07.40
Yeah, so one of the things that I and you hear me talk about this before is perspective.

1111
01:22:07.40 --> 01:22:10.56
And wanting to see, I always talk about it from a leadership perspective like I want to

1112
01:22:10.56 --> 01:22:13.80
think about what my superior is thinking.

1113
01:22:13.80 --> 01:22:14.80
Why is he telling me to do this?

1114
01:22:14.80 --> 01:22:16.04
Let me get his perspective.

1115
01:22:16.04 --> 01:22:19.52
And then what are my, what are my subordinates thinking?

1116
01:22:19.52 --> 01:22:21.44
What is their perspective?

1117
01:22:21.44 --> 01:22:25.20
And it's a very useful tool to use and what you're talking about right now.

1118
01:22:25.20 --> 01:22:29.08
And I remember I had a situation like that where I would be like, I'm not going to

1119
01:22:29.08 --> 01:22:30.08
always at work.

1120
01:22:30.08 --> 01:22:33.12
And I forget what was going on, but something was going on.

1121
01:22:33.12 --> 01:22:36.32
Like I think we were preparing to deploy guys earlier.

1122
01:22:36.32 --> 01:22:38.44
There's something major was going on.

1123
01:22:38.44 --> 01:22:40.12
There was major issues.

1124
01:22:40.12 --> 01:22:42.48
I think it was Afghanistan.

1125
01:22:42.48 --> 01:22:44.08
And we were getting ready to deploy guys early.

1126
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:46.88
It was a real big spin up and all this stuff.

1127
01:22:46.88 --> 01:22:53.44
And literally I come home and I mean, I'm at work and we're trying to figure out I

1128
01:22:53.44 --> 01:22:58.28
were put this plan together and guys are going to play and it's horrible and you know,

1129
01:22:58.28 --> 01:22:59.04
whatever.

1130
01:22:59.04 --> 01:23:00.04
I'm just stressed.

1131
01:23:00.04 --> 01:23:03.48
I come home and I, hey, babe, you know how you doing?

1132
01:23:03.48 --> 01:23:07.88
I said in my wife and she's sitting there and all of a sudden she like picks up the

1133
01:23:07.88 --> 01:23:11.56
phone and someone calls her or she, someone calls her, she picks up the phone and she

1134
01:23:11.56 --> 01:23:12.56
hangs up.

1135
01:23:12.56 --> 01:23:13.80
She's like, I can't believe this.

1136
01:23:13.80 --> 01:23:17.16
Yeah, and I'm like, I thought something, you know, I thought someone died or

1137
01:23:17.16 --> 01:23:18.16
whatever.

1138
01:23:18.16 --> 01:23:20.72
And I said, I said, oh, what's wrong?

1139
01:23:20.72 --> 01:23:21.72
What's wrong?

1140
01:23:21.72 --> 01:23:26.60
And she said, um, there was something along like the wiggles is the same night as

1141
01:23:26.60 --> 01:23:28.52
Barney and I booked both tickets.

1142
01:23:28.52 --> 01:23:33.44
So with some things she was taking the kids to that like the literally did not matter

1143
01:23:33.44 --> 01:23:35.80
in any way shape or formed a me at all.

1144
01:23:35.80 --> 01:23:40.68
But it's her, you know, she had spent $22 on these tickets for three kids at the time.

1145
01:23:40.68 --> 01:23:46.52
At $66 and now she had booked double booked the children for multiple shows.

1146
01:23:46.52 --> 01:23:47.52
It was harsh.

1147
01:23:47.52 --> 01:23:52.48
But what I had to do is well, you know, I had to go in perspective in a whole and

1148
01:23:52.48 --> 01:23:53.48
world.

1149
01:23:53.48 --> 01:23:56.08
Man, that was $66, right?

1150
01:23:56.08 --> 01:23:59.16
And it was the kids and it was, they both wanted to see all the shows or whatever the

1151
01:23:59.16 --> 01:24:00.16
thing was.

1152
01:24:00.16 --> 01:24:04.20
So in her perspective, in her part of the world, that's a really big deal.

1153
01:24:04.20 --> 01:24:09.60
And so that's, I think something you're going to do as a, as a, as a, as a human, always

1154
01:24:09.60 --> 01:24:11.16
look at one of the people's perspectives are.

1155
01:24:11.16 --> 01:24:14.48
And you know what, if people are pissed off, if your wife's freaking out because you didn't

1156
01:24:14.48 --> 01:24:18.40
do the dishes, I got some really easy solution to that.

1157
01:24:18.40 --> 01:24:20.84
Do the dishes.

1158
01:24:20.84 --> 01:24:21.84
Just do the dishes.

1159
01:24:21.84 --> 01:24:22.84
Yeah.

1160
01:24:22.84 --> 01:24:26.92
You were put on some music and scrub some pots and pans.

1161
01:24:26.92 --> 01:24:27.92
Let's do this.

1162
01:24:27.92 --> 01:24:29.92
You know what, I'll scrub some pots and pans.

1163
01:24:29.92 --> 01:24:30.92
Be happy to.

1164
01:24:30.92 --> 01:24:31.92
Let's do this happen.

1165
01:24:31.92 --> 01:24:32.92
Yeah.

1166
01:24:32.92 --> 01:24:33.92
That's good, man.

1167
01:24:33.92 --> 01:24:38.92
And then, you know, that if you have the ability and kind of the wherewithal to do that, to, to,

1168
01:24:38.92 --> 01:24:42.80
really it's detaching, you detaching and looking at their situation, not looking at it from

1169
01:24:42.80 --> 01:24:46.84
your own personal situation.

1170
01:24:46.84 --> 01:24:50.40
If you can manage to do that, and I think it helps when someone reminds you, like, just

1171
01:24:50.40 --> 01:24:51.80
like, you say, right now.

1172
01:24:51.80 --> 01:24:54.64
And maybe someone will be like, hey, you know what, let me, let me go ahead and remember

1173
01:24:54.64 --> 01:24:55.64
that next time.

1174
01:24:55.64 --> 01:24:56.96
You know, all this stuff.

1175
01:24:56.96 --> 01:25:00.60
And I say this to leaders all the time when I go out and work with companies.

1176
01:25:00.60 --> 01:25:02.32
It's so much of it is just about awareness.

1177
01:25:02.32 --> 01:25:03.32
Yes.

1178
01:25:03.32 --> 01:25:06.96
When you become aware of the problem, you become aware of the mistake or you become aware

1179
01:25:06.96 --> 01:25:07.96
of the solution.

1180
01:25:07.96 --> 01:25:08.96
And it's there in front of you.

1181
01:25:08.96 --> 01:25:09.96
Then it becomes very easy.

1182
01:25:09.96 --> 01:25:14.60
The problem is, you people aren't aware of how easy it can be to solve some of these things.

1183
01:25:14.60 --> 01:25:17.72
If you just make this small adjustment to your mentality.

1184
01:25:17.72 --> 01:25:18.72
Yeah.

1185
01:25:18.72 --> 01:25:24.96
The way of is the fact that you're freaking steaming red lining for the fifth time, your

1186
01:25:24.96 --> 01:25:29.40
wife told you to do something when like I said, you're worrying about your guys getting

1187
01:25:29.40 --> 01:25:30.64
killed yesterday.

1188
01:25:30.64 --> 01:25:32.24
Yes, today is a go.

1189
01:25:32.24 --> 01:25:33.24
Yeah.

1190
01:25:33.24 --> 01:25:37.76
As one of my buddies, you used to say, when we are coming home from our first deployment,

1191
01:25:37.76 --> 01:25:41.48
he says, can you believe this tomorrow?

1192
01:25:41.48 --> 01:25:45.24
We're going to get on an aluminum tube and we're going to wake up back in Sydney.

1193
01:25:45.24 --> 01:25:49.28

1194
01:25:49.28 --> 01:25:50.28
I'll stay.

1195
01:25:50.28 --> 01:25:52.24
You need to be broke.

1196
01:25:52.24 --> 01:25:53.88
All right.

1197

It's really like about it.

01:26:19.48 --> 01:26:24.84
So the warrior bar, it's like, it's like, it's like beef jerky with some spice in it

1212
01:26:24.84 --> 01:26:26.92
and some cranberries and it's tasty.

But there's that tender.

1216
01:26:31.36 --> 01:26:32.36

What they do by.

1218
01:26:33.36 --> 01:26:34.36
It's like that.

1219
01:26:34.36 --> 01:26:37.92
It's, it tastes really good and like moist.

1220
01:26:37.92 --> 01:26:38.92
It's good.

1221
01:26:38.92 --> 01:26:39.92
It's a dried.

1222
01:26:39.92 --> 01:26:40.92
Right.

1223
01:26:40.92 --> 01:26:41.92
So yeah.

I like that.

1228
01:26:49.56 --> 01:26:50.56
That's important.

1229
01:26:50.56 --> 01:26:51.56
I think.

1230
01:26:51.56 --> 01:26:52.56
Yes.

1231
01:26:52.56 --> 01:26:53.56
Dan, warrior bar.

1232
01:26:53.56 --> 01:26:55.20
Yeah, that, it's kind of a genius solution because you know how people

01:26:55.20 --> 01:26:57.72
be like, hey, I'll take my protein shake.

1234
01:26:57.72 --> 01:27:00.44
A warrior bar is like made with actual food.

1235
01:27:00.44 --> 01:27:01.44
Yes.

1236
01:27:01.44 --> 01:27:02.44
That's legit.

1237
01:27:02.44 --> 01:27:03.68
So yeah, you can get all that.

1238
01:27:03.68 --> 01:27:07.28
And you can just get after them all day long.

1239
01:27:07.28 --> 01:27:10.88

01:27:15.56 --> 01:27:16.56
Sure.

They a lot of people were indicating that they like the books that you cover.

1272

And they're like, hey, let me, you know, get those books.

01:28:21.04 --> 01:28:22.04
You know what?

1274
01:28:22.04 --> 01:28:23.04
You should do.

1275
01:28:23.04 --> 01:28:27.000
You should have the list, the library of books that you've covered and link them.

1276
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
So guess what?

1277
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I did.

1278
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Echo Scott.

1279
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Echo makes things happen.

1280
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
That's what I like.

1281
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.84
Now on jaccopodcast.com on the top.

1282
01:28:33.84 --> 01:28:36.28
I added it on the menu where it says books.

1283
01:28:36.28 --> 01:28:37.28
It just says books.

1284
01:28:37.28 --> 01:28:38.28
I don't know.

1285
01:28:38.28 --> 01:28:39.28
Okay.

1286
01:28:39.28 --> 01:28:43.16
And you click on there to have all the podcasts episodes, you know, the book, what

1287
01:28:43.16 --> 01:28:44.56
podcast episode is on.

You click on it, boom, you can get it.

1289
01:28:46.20 --> 01:28:47.20
That's awesome.

1290
01:28:47.20 --> 01:28:48.20
Yeah.

1291
01:28:48.20 --> 01:28:49.20
Easy.

1292
01:28:49.20 --> 01:28:50.20
All right.

1293
01:28:50.20 --> 01:28:51.56
Let's get some questions.

1294
01:28:51.56 --> 01:28:52.56
Okay.

1295
01:28:52.56 --> 01:28:56.20
Question number one.

1296
01:28:56.20 --> 01:29:01.72
Is taking extreme ownership the same as apologizing for failures or apologizing for

1297
01:29:01.72 --> 01:29:02.84
others mistakes?

1298
01:29:02.84 --> 01:29:07.08
I'm having difficulty separating these two concepts when I try to take ownership over

1299
01:29:07.08 --> 01:29:08.08
failures.

1300
01:29:08.08 --> 01:29:13.36
Does taking ownership of failure generally include in I'm sorry, X occurred?

1301
01:29:13.36 --> 01:29:15.08
It's such or it's such.

1302
01:29:15.08 --> 01:29:20.88
Well, it isn't just apologizing, right?

1303
01:29:20.88 --> 01:29:23.36
It isn't just saying, oh, I apologize this happened.

1304
01:29:23.36 --> 01:29:24.36
It's part of it.

1305
01:29:24.36 --> 01:29:25.68
Part of ownership is apologizing.

1306
01:29:25.68 --> 01:29:28.52
If you make a mistake, you've got to own it and generally you've got to say, hey, look,

1307
01:29:28.52 --> 01:29:30.48
I'm sorry this happened.

1308
01:29:30.48 --> 01:29:34.72
You've got to own that there's been a problem or a mistake or an issue.

1309
01:29:34.72 --> 01:29:40.96
And that does include other people's mistakes, but you have to literally take ownership

1310
01:29:40.96 --> 01:29:43.80
of them.

1311
01:29:43.80 --> 01:29:47.08
You can't say, hey, I'm sorry these other people made mistakes.

1312
01:29:47.08 --> 01:29:49.12
That's not what I'm talking about.

1313
01:29:49.12 --> 01:29:54.08
And it's look, the mistakes that were made were actually my fault.

1314
01:29:54.08 --> 01:30:01.68
And another important thing here is you can't just say, hey, guys, it's all my fault.

1315
01:30:01.68 --> 01:30:05.52
You actually need to believe it yourself.

1316
01:30:05.52 --> 01:30:11.76
You need to believe that you failed in the situation to do the right thing or make something

1317
01:30:11.76 --> 01:30:14.68
happen or make the right decision or make the right call and do the right preparation

1318
01:30:14.68 --> 01:30:18.32
or whatever it is that you're supposed to do, you need to do that.

1319
01:30:18.32 --> 01:30:20.000
You need to believe that.

1320
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.64
You can't just say it.

1321
01:30:21.64 --> 01:30:25.12
And you say these mistakes were my fault.

1322
01:30:25.12 --> 01:30:27.72
Here's why it was my fault.

1323
01:30:27.72 --> 01:30:29.12
And yeah, I'm sorry that these things happen.

1324
01:30:29.12 --> 01:30:31.16
I apologize with this happening.

1325
01:30:31.16 --> 01:30:37.16
And some people see sorry as a sign of weakness.

1326
01:30:37.16 --> 01:30:42.84
And honestly, there's some legal situations you might be in or some negotiations that you

1327
01:30:42.84 --> 01:30:45.08
might be in where that might be true.

1328
01:30:45.08 --> 01:30:52.000
But most of the time, I was just going to work in environment, inside of a team.

1329
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Sorry is okay.

1330
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:59.80
And in fact, an apology is often the first step in moving forward.

1331
01:30:59.80 --> 01:31:06.92
And it's generally going to be a little bit of a blow to your ego.

1332
01:31:06.92 --> 01:31:12.32
Now, and that's especially true because your mystery and ownership now or Mrs. extreme

1333
01:31:12.32 --> 01:31:13.32
ownership.

1334
01:31:13.32 --> 01:31:14.32
Guess what?

1335
01:31:14.32 --> 01:31:15.88
That doesn't mean everyone else is not yet.

1336
01:31:15.88 --> 01:31:16.88
They'll get there.

1337
01:31:16.88 --> 01:31:18.28
But they're not there yet.

1338
01:31:18.28 --> 01:31:20.32
So you apologize to someone.

1339
01:31:20.32 --> 01:31:24.16
It's going to be a big blow to your ego, especially when someone says, you're damn right

1340
01:31:24.16 --> 01:31:27.04
that was your fault.

1341
01:31:27.04 --> 01:31:28.04
That's going to hurt your ego.

1342
01:31:28.04 --> 01:31:30.80
I don't want to lash back out, but you can't.

1343
01:31:30.80 --> 01:31:33.000
You've got to put your ego in check.

1344
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And you got to go, hey, I understand.

1345
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
That is my fault.

1346
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.20
Why I'm saying it's my fault?

1347
01:31:37.20 --> 01:31:38.96
Because I truly believe it was my fault.

1348
01:31:38.96 --> 01:31:40.000
Because it is.

1349
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.60
Because it is your fault.

1350
01:31:42.60 --> 01:31:46.40
So you have to be careful when someone glows don't let that get your head.

1351
01:31:46.40 --> 01:31:48.36
That's what you have to do.

1352
01:31:48.36 --> 01:31:51.20
And it's not just for you that you're doing this.

1353
01:31:51.20 --> 01:31:55.68
It's because the team has to figure out what the problem is.

1354
01:31:55.68 --> 01:31:58.28
Someone's going to take ownership of the problem, that's you.

1355
01:31:58.28 --> 01:32:00.16
And then I'll tell you you get the problem solved.

1356
01:32:00.16 --> 01:32:03.000
And I'll tell you something else.

1357
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.92
And you might have predicted this.

1358
01:32:05.92 --> 01:32:12.92
But my sorry and my apology comes with something else.

1359
01:32:12.92 --> 01:32:14.92
99% of the time.

1360
01:32:14.92 --> 01:32:19.28
And that's a good.

1361
01:32:19.28 --> 01:32:22.24
So look, hey, I'm sorry that this happened.

1362
01:32:22.24 --> 01:32:23.40
This is my fault.

1363
01:32:23.40 --> 01:32:24.80
But I'm glad it happened now.

1364
01:32:24.80 --> 01:32:25.80
Oh, yeah.

1365
01:32:25.80 --> 01:32:27.48
Hey, you know what?

1366
01:32:27.48 --> 01:32:29.32
I'm glad we made this mistake.

1367
01:32:29.32 --> 01:32:30.48
We made this mistake right now.

1368
01:32:30.48 --> 01:32:33.56
It's going to set us back a little bit good because when we're not going to make it with

1369
01:32:33.56 --> 01:32:35.56
a client.

1370
01:32:35.56 --> 01:32:39.04
Oh, this happened.

1371
01:32:39.04 --> 01:32:40.48
This part of the project fell apart.

1372
01:32:40.48 --> 01:32:41.48
Good.

1373
01:32:41.48 --> 01:32:42.48
Now we can fix it.

1374
01:32:42.48 --> 01:32:43.48
We know about it.

1375
01:32:43.48 --> 01:32:45.60
Oh, this went sideways.

1376
01:32:45.60 --> 01:32:46.60
I missed it.

1377
01:32:46.60 --> 01:32:47.60
Good.

1378
01:32:47.60 --> 01:32:49.60
I won't let it happen again.

1379
01:32:49.60 --> 01:32:54.76
So throw yourself a little good on the end of your sorry.

1380
01:32:54.76 --> 01:32:55.76
Yeah.

1381
01:32:55.76 --> 01:32:56.76
All right.

1382
01:32:56.76 --> 01:33:01.88
Yeah, a lot of times those problems or mistakes or whatever they add to that experience,

1383
01:33:01.88 --> 01:33:04.04
like the experience of being there.

1384
01:33:04.04 --> 01:33:08.04
You know, where let's say you go through a path and you make a wrong turn.

1385
01:33:08.04 --> 01:33:10.04
Now you have that experience that that's a wrong turn.

1386
01:33:10.04 --> 01:33:11.32
That's what that looks like.

1387
01:33:11.32 --> 01:33:12.76
That's what that feels like.

1388
01:33:12.76 --> 01:33:14.04
And guess what?

1389
01:33:14.04 --> 01:33:15.88
We're going to avoid that in the future.

1390
01:33:15.88 --> 01:33:19.76
Rather than a bunch of situations where we're, for example, one in the future where it's

1391
01:33:19.76 --> 01:33:20.76
more detrimental.

1392
01:33:20.76 --> 01:33:23.08
Now you don't run into that.

1393
01:33:23.08 --> 01:33:24.08
Yeah.

1394
01:33:24.08 --> 01:33:25.08
You learned.

1395
01:33:25.08 --> 01:33:26.08
You learned.

1396
01:33:26.08 --> 01:33:27.08
I probably think of it.

1397
01:33:27.08 --> 01:33:28.08
So a video that said that.

1398
01:33:28.08 --> 01:33:29.08
Be good.

1399
01:33:29.08 --> 01:33:30.08
You learned.

1400
01:33:30.08 --> 01:33:32.08
All right.

1401
01:33:32.08 --> 01:33:35.20
Next question.

1402
01:33:35.20 --> 01:33:37.80
Is there a way to be a straight shooter?

1403
01:33:37.80 --> 01:33:38.80
Oh, sorry.

1404
01:33:38.80 --> 01:33:47.96
Is there a way to be straight shooter jocco and not be a jerk or piss people off?

1405
01:33:47.96 --> 01:33:52.96
You know, this is a touch you.

1406
01:33:52.96 --> 01:33:58.20
Is everybody has so much respect for the straight shooter, right?

1407
01:33:58.20 --> 01:34:01.84
Hey, that guy's a straight shooter and you want to be a straight shooter.

1408
01:34:01.84 --> 01:34:04.04
You don't want to be someone that you don't want to be the opposite.

1409
01:34:04.04 --> 01:34:05.04
What's the opposite of a straight shooter?

1410
01:34:05.04 --> 01:34:06.04
That's like a liar.

1411
01:34:06.04 --> 01:34:07.04
Right.

1412
01:34:07.04 --> 01:34:08.04
The seever.

1413
01:34:08.04 --> 01:34:09.04
A deceiver, right?

1414
01:34:09.04 --> 01:34:11.20
So of course, we want to be the straight shooter.

1415
01:34:11.20 --> 01:34:15.68
Let me tell you, it is very difficult to be a straight shooter with everybody.

1416
01:34:15.68 --> 01:34:21.20
Even when you have a tremendous relationship with somebody, a tremendous relationship with

1417
01:34:21.20 --> 01:34:22.20
somebody.

1418
01:34:22.20 --> 01:34:25.04
Can you really be a straight shooter with them?

1419
01:34:25.04 --> 01:34:27.16
A true straight shooter.

1420
01:34:27.16 --> 01:34:37.88
I've been a true straight shooter with probably three or four people in my life.

1421
01:34:37.88 --> 01:34:41.44
In my life, I've been a straight shooter with maybe three or four people.

1422
01:34:41.44 --> 01:34:43.44
That's off the top of my head.

1423
01:34:43.44 --> 01:34:46.04
But I'm just saying it's not a big number.

1424
01:34:46.04 --> 01:34:52.52
It's got to be something that you are so in sync with.

1425
01:34:52.52 --> 01:34:53.52
I'm thinking about that.

1426
01:34:53.52 --> 01:34:58.12
I don't think that's impossible for me in my situation.

1427
01:34:58.12 --> 01:34:59.40
It's hard to be a straight shooter.

1428
01:34:59.40 --> 01:35:02.20
How can you reconcile being a straight shooter now?

1429
01:35:02.20 --> 01:35:03.20
Consider what that means.

1430
01:35:03.20 --> 01:35:07.04
But to be a straight shooter with somebody at all times.

1431
01:35:07.04 --> 01:35:09.04
Can't really do that.

1432
01:35:09.04 --> 01:35:10.28
What do we do instead?

1433
01:35:10.28 --> 01:35:14.08
You've got to use the indirect approach, the indirect approach.

1434
01:35:14.08 --> 01:35:15.80
I'm talking about this all the time.

1435
01:35:15.80 --> 01:35:20.64
This is a nuance that people come out on podcasts 12.

1436
01:35:20.64 --> 01:35:22.64
They say, hey, I heard you say this.

1437
01:35:22.64 --> 01:35:27.06
I'm going to go, remember that question we got to ask, do you ever get told you're

1438
01:35:27.06 --> 01:35:28.36
to direct to intense?

1439
01:35:28.36 --> 01:35:31.16
It's like no, I don't get told that.

1440
01:35:31.16 --> 01:35:33.92
Because I don't believe in being trying to be a straight shooter with everybody.

1441
01:35:33.92 --> 01:35:37.64
What I believe in is trying to get my message across to people so that it gets absorbed

1442
01:35:37.64 --> 01:35:39.64
by them.

1443
01:35:39.64 --> 01:35:43.84
The minute you straight shoot somebody, their defenses go up and it becomes problematic.

1444
01:35:43.84 --> 01:35:49.08
There's some indirect approaches when you have these discussions with people when you

1445
01:35:49.08 --> 01:35:51.76
use conversation to get your point across.

1446
01:35:51.76 --> 01:35:55.36
Hey, I was looking at this and I was wondering what I could do better.

1447
01:35:55.36 --> 01:35:57.12
Can you help me?

1448
01:35:57.12 --> 01:35:59.96
Or what can we do better?

1449
01:35:59.96 --> 01:36:02.12
You throwing the Wii on it.

1450
01:36:02.12 --> 01:36:03.84
Or you don't want to say something like that.

1451
01:36:03.84 --> 01:36:06.40
You got so much going on right now.

1452
01:36:06.40 --> 01:36:07.52
Do you want me to take anything off you?

1453
01:36:07.52 --> 01:36:10.72
You want me to take that thing off you're played that's kind of like a small little

1454
01:36:10.72 --> 01:36:11.72
detail.

1455
01:36:11.72 --> 01:36:13.52
Do you want me to handle that?

1456
01:36:13.52 --> 01:36:17.56
Or you know, hey, it seems like you're having a micromanage this guy over here.

1457
01:36:17.56 --> 01:36:21.68
You want me to go straight in that out and run that?

1458
01:36:21.68 --> 01:36:24.04
Or it seems like this guy is taking up too much of your time.

1459
01:36:24.04 --> 01:36:30.64
You want me to take that over or take that person over or you know it's a good one.

1460
01:36:30.64 --> 01:36:35.68
Is hey, can you help me with my team members?

1461
01:36:35.68 --> 01:36:40.16
I just want to sit down with you and just like have you talked to me about what you

1462
01:36:40.16 --> 01:36:42.68
see in my team members.

1463
01:36:42.68 --> 01:36:49.52
And then when you're you're discussing your team members and other people even your peers

1464
01:36:49.52 --> 01:36:50.80
and what they do good in that.

1465
01:36:50.80 --> 01:36:55.16
But what you're really doing is you're just tossing some things their way, some little

1466
01:36:55.16 --> 01:37:00.20
things their way so that they understand and they it and it's kind of like teaching

1467
01:37:00.20 --> 01:37:03.72
to get to right when you teach when you teach a move or teaching anything when you teach

1468
01:37:03.72 --> 01:37:06.40
a move you learn it better right?

1469
01:37:06.40 --> 01:37:10.08
If you make somebody teach a move they're going to learn it better.

1470
01:37:10.08 --> 01:37:16.000
So when you make someone sit down with you and go through the issues that people are having

1471
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.20
it actually makes them self-reflect but they don't know it.

1472
01:37:21.20 --> 01:37:23.80
But they reap the results of it.

1473
01:37:23.80 --> 01:37:28.80
So that's a that's a crafty one that I've used a bunch.

1474
01:37:28.80 --> 01:37:30.28
Let's see here's a good one.

1475
01:37:30.28 --> 01:37:32.24
I think I'm letting you down.

1476
01:37:32.24 --> 01:37:33.52
I don't think I'm doing a good enough job.

1477
01:37:33.52 --> 01:37:37.20
You know it's like I think I'm just be careful with that one.

1478
01:37:37.20 --> 01:37:41.04
It seems like if you if you hit the wrong tone, you're going to be careful with all these.

1479
01:37:41.04 --> 01:37:42.04
You gotta be careful with all these.

1480
01:37:42.04 --> 01:37:44.52
You gotta be tactful.

1481
01:37:44.52 --> 01:37:49.92
You can ask some more direct questions but when you ask the more direct questions you

1482
01:37:49.92 --> 01:37:56.28
gotta be sort of you gotta be true you gotta be you gotta come across as being very truthful

1483
01:37:56.28 --> 01:37:58.12
in your in your inquisition.

1484
01:37:58.12 --> 01:38:01.72
So for instance hey what was the strategy that you were thinking about over here?

1485
01:38:01.72 --> 01:38:05.76
Like before this old thing of fellow part you know what to have but you know what you think

1486
01:38:05.76 --> 01:38:09.78
or or hey what was what were you thinking about when you put this together because I

1487
01:38:09.78 --> 01:38:12.48
I don't quite I don't quite get it.

1488
01:38:12.48 --> 01:38:13.72
You gotta be careful that's another one.

1489
01:38:13.72 --> 01:38:14.72
Yeah.

1490
01:38:14.72 --> 01:38:15.72
You gotta be careful.

1491
01:38:15.72 --> 01:38:16.72
You gotta be careful.

1492
01:38:16.72 --> 01:38:17.72
That's okay.

1493
01:38:17.72 --> 01:38:19.72
What were you thinking right?

1494
01:38:19.72 --> 01:38:20.72
Right.

1495
01:38:20.72 --> 01:38:21.72
Right.

1496
01:38:21.72 --> 01:38:22.92
You gotta be soft with you.

1497
01:38:22.92 --> 01:38:28.88
So it's much better to be indirect and most of these cases.

1498
01:38:28.88 --> 01:38:31.60
And hopefully you can build relationships with people where you can be more direct or you

1499
01:38:31.60 --> 01:38:35.50
can get that conversation to be where it needs to be to where you can get the key

1500
01:38:35.50 --> 01:38:38.70
critical information across but it's very very challenging.

1501
01:38:38.70 --> 01:38:39.70
Yeah.

1502
01:38:39.70 --> 01:38:42.94
And again, it ain't it's not that challenging it's not impossible I did it with everybody

1503
01:38:42.94 --> 01:38:43.94
all the time.

1504
01:38:43.94 --> 01:38:47.50
I always had got my point across to people.

1505
01:38:47.50 --> 01:38:54.10
Always you know and I'll tell you this is something when I would straight shoot somebody

1506
01:38:54.10 --> 01:39:01.46
I would and this is if I really needed to straight shoot somebody I would write them

1507
01:39:01.46 --> 01:39:11.10
a very lengthy email to say hey here's what's going on here's what I'm saying and I would

1508
01:39:11.10 --> 01:39:17.90
really craft it with a lot of patience and and then I would either do once I wrote the

1509
01:39:17.90 --> 01:39:22.98
email I would either use that and wouldn't send it but I'd use it as a guide to myself

1510
01:39:22.98 --> 01:39:26.46
like okay this is the conversation I'm gonna have or I'd send it to them for real.

1511
01:39:26.46 --> 01:39:27.46
Like a deal.

1512
01:39:27.46 --> 01:39:30.82
Yeah like a deal note you know I actually read one of those.

1513
01:39:30.82 --> 01:39:36.50
I read one of those on on on on on on on or two or five I think it was number five that

1514
01:39:36.50 --> 01:39:39.98
is one of those things that I did I said okay you know what I got to help this guy out

1515
01:39:39.98 --> 01:39:43.90
got to be direct with them he's making some mistakes I want him do better here's a

1516
01:39:43.90 --> 01:39:50.66
little deal note for you get you square away the thing is these this is definitely hard

1517
01:39:50.66 --> 01:39:55.06
but it's not impossible you got to just have the open mind you got to use your

1518
01:39:55.06 --> 01:40:00.74
attack you got to use your judgment and you got to build relationships and have conversations with people

1519
01:40:00.74 --> 01:40:06.82
and and know what your intention is in the conversation and just keep slowly moving in that

1520
01:40:06.82 --> 01:40:07.82
direction.

1521
01:40:07.82 --> 01:40:13.30
You know what I a tip and I'm gonna say this tip because I like when people do it to me

1522
01:40:13.30 --> 01:40:20.50
when they're like correcting me or whatever is sprinkling little comments about the stuff

1523
01:40:20.50 --> 01:40:22.30
that that they did right.

1524
01:40:22.30 --> 01:40:24.30
Yeah that's a common practice.

1525
01:40:24.30 --> 01:40:29.34
Yeah but when you do that though you add in this you add in and that's what I like about

1526
01:40:29.34 --> 01:40:33.82
you you do this you know so it's you know so if you add in that's what I like about you

1527
01:40:33.82 --> 01:40:38.10
it kind of individualizes that person like I'm the guy who does that you know that good

1528
01:40:38.10 --> 01:40:41.18
part so it gives them that confidence so it's kind of like yeah tell me more kind of

1529
01:40:41.18 --> 01:40:47.18
attitude and then at the end doing like something along the lines of like yeah good

1530
01:40:47.18 --> 01:40:50.82
thanks you know thanks for the time or whatever and then be like I got your back yeah kind

1531
01:40:50.82 --> 01:40:51.82
of lead.

1532
01:40:51.82 --> 01:40:56.70
Well I mean we could go over techniques all night long those are both good ones you know

1533
01:40:56.70 --> 01:41:01.02
another one is like hey listen I think you can be a top performer here I think you're

1534
01:41:01.02 --> 01:41:04.02
gonna this is if you're talking to someone that's you know like a subordinate I think

1535
01:41:04.02 --> 01:41:08.76
you can be a top performer here there's here's what you're kicking ass out yes this

1536
01:41:08.76 --> 01:41:13.78
this and this here's this these two things right here if we can get these fixed you're

1537
01:41:13.78 --> 01:41:18.38
going platinum when we get these things when we get you know you're gonna pause it look

1538
01:41:18.38 --> 01:41:22.50
you I'm I'm imagining in the sense of you telling me this and like you get

1539
01:41:22.50 --> 01:41:28.34
to yourself you know yeah so like they just say like when I'd be like hey and I'd

1540
01:41:28.34 --> 01:41:32.74
ask him to say I'm in this position and he'd be like like yeah then later on you

1541
01:41:32.74 --> 01:41:36.06
know I text him what are the hey thanks for going over this with me just like

1542
01:41:36.06 --> 01:41:39.54
Cabrol you don't keep it up and you can be like a world champion you just say that

1543
01:41:39.54 --> 01:41:42.86
and I don't know who else he says that to everybody I don't know he's never said

1544
01:41:42.86 --> 01:41:48.18
that to me that's because we hate each other but for that moment I'm like

1545
01:41:48.18 --> 01:41:53.38
hell yeah you know like I hope he corrects me more I hope he tells me how to do

1546
01:41:53.38 --> 01:41:56.22
this because he obviously just like I was saying you know you could be a top

1547
01:41:56.22 --> 01:42:00.78
performer here yeah tell me what else what can I do what can I do and actually the

1548
01:42:00.78 --> 01:42:07.74
point that you're making is very good point which is you know picture going to

1549
01:42:07.74 --> 01:42:10.74
perspective of the other person and what is it gonna sound like to them and that's

1550
01:42:10.74 --> 01:42:15.74
a smart thing to do so you're you're hearing what you would hear if you were

1551
01:42:15.74 --> 01:42:24.90
them yeah yeah indirect people be indirect it's harder it's challenging it takes

1552
01:42:24.90 --> 01:42:30.50
more time it takes more patience and it is way more effective in fact

1553
01:42:30.50 --> 01:42:34.58
and we talked about how before like some people they'll be like hey I'm just

1554
01:42:34.58 --> 01:42:38.18
I'm just I tell it how it is you know I tell how it is and if you don't like

1555
01:42:38.18 --> 01:42:42.62
you kind of think and all right go ahead and do that but see how that works out for

1556
01:42:42.62 --> 01:42:45.38
you know see how many people follow you see many people want to listen to you

1557
01:42:45.38 --> 01:42:50.26
many people want to be around you even you know I like the indirect approach to

1558
01:42:50.26 --> 01:42:56.78
next question joko what is the number one philosophical lesson that you've

1559
01:42:56.78 --> 01:43:10.86
learned from jiu jitsu yeah so jiu jitsu emphasizes so much of what I believe

1560
01:43:10.86 --> 01:43:18.02
that it's tough to narrow down but I will but I will throw some things out

1561
01:43:18.02 --> 01:43:23.18
there that kind of our part of jiu jitsu and our part of what I believe

1562
01:43:23.18 --> 01:43:30.82
first of all we just talked about being indirect an indirect attacks flanking

1563
01:43:30.82 --> 01:43:34.38
that's what you have to do in jiu jitsu you have to set things up you have to

1564
01:43:34.38 --> 01:43:38.94
detach you have to detach from the chaos and from the emotional you cannot get

1565
01:43:38.94 --> 01:43:42.62
emotional on the mat attack the flanks you gotta hit people where they're

1566
01:43:42.62 --> 01:43:47.34
expecting it you gotta have a plan but you gotta be ready to adapt you gotta

1567
01:43:47.34 --> 01:43:53.70
constantly improve your position you gotta have fun while you're doing it you

1568
01:43:53.70 --> 01:43:57.02
gotta practice being in bad situations you gotta make your training is

1569
01:43:57.02 --> 01:44:01.06
realistic as possible right these are all things I talk about these in all

1570
01:44:01.06 --> 01:44:08.90
aspects of combat and in business and in life you gotta be physically fit

1571
01:44:08.90 --> 01:44:14.50
to your mind stay sharp that's true true in jiu jitsu it's true in combat it's

1572
01:44:14.50 --> 01:44:20.78
true in life you gotta know when to tap right you gotta know when to tap you

1573
01:44:20.78 --> 01:44:24.86
gotta know when to give up on a single battle so that you don't lose the whole

1574
01:44:24.86 --> 01:44:30.54
war gotta train for worst case scenarios you gotta start with that person on

1575
01:44:30.54 --> 01:44:38.18
your back gotta start with the person with you in an arm lock and training for

1576
01:44:38.18 --> 01:44:41.26
combat you gotta train for those worst case scenarios where you're outnumbered

1577
01:44:41.26 --> 01:44:43.98
you got a bunker position and there's shooting paintball at you and you got

1578
01:44:43.98 --> 01:44:47.42
down men that's what you gotta do you gotta train for the worst case scenarios

1579
01:44:47.42 --> 01:44:52.78
and same thing with business I work with like sales group sometimes and they'll

1580
01:44:52.78 --> 01:44:58.78
do role play and I'll say you know be the worst customer you can possibly be

1581
01:44:58.78 --> 01:45:03.14
exactly when this person meets a normal human they they know how to knock it out

1582
01:45:03.14 --> 01:45:09.34
of the park here's another one from jiu jitsu basically don't judge a book by

1583
01:45:09.34 --> 01:45:13.46
it's cover right because you don't know if the person that you're about the

1584
01:45:13.46 --> 01:45:19.34
slap is Jeff Glover or his Dean Lister or Jill Tudor or Joel Tudor you don't

1585
01:45:19.34 --> 01:45:23.66
know what's gonna happen so you don't judge a book by it's cover yeah I mean Dean

1586
01:45:23.66 --> 01:45:27.22
you'd be less apt to slap than you would Jeff Glover I guess that's a good

1587
01:45:27.22 --> 01:45:31.58
point Dean you can kind of judge by the cover yeah the cover is pretty evident but

1588
01:45:31.58 --> 01:45:38.18
Jeffy or Joel yeah you know those guys weigh 150 pounds and you know a surfer

1589
01:45:38.18 --> 01:45:43.30
guy and a whatever Jeff is I don't know what genre of human you put Jeff into

1590
01:45:43.30 --> 01:45:53.30
but you wouldn't think that he would throw a dars choke on your face so that's

1591
01:45:53.30 --> 01:45:58.82
that prioritize an execute in the jiu jitsu I mean we just talked about it

1592
01:45:58.82 --> 01:46:02.94
14 times tonight for combat talk about in business all the time you got to

1593
01:46:02.94 --> 01:46:05.18
make sure that the initiatives that you're running you don't have 38

1594
01:46:05.18 --> 01:46:08.90
initiatives and you jitsu guess what you hear this all the time you're

1595
01:46:08.90 --> 01:46:12.98
getting about to get choked you got to protect your neck number one you got to

1596
01:46:12.98 --> 01:46:15.74
protect your neck yeah then you can worry about your leg and then you can

1597
01:46:15.74 --> 01:46:17.90
worry about your arm and the hooks and everything else which got to protect the

1598
01:46:17.90 --> 01:46:25.26
neck you got to prioritize yeah gotta keep things simple you got to create

1599
01:46:25.26 --> 01:46:31.02
you got to have an open mind you got to be creative and look for different ways

1600
01:46:31.02 --> 01:46:35.34
to win and different things to do you got to make sure you don't get trapped in

1601
01:46:35.34 --> 01:46:42.34
your ruts mentally trapped in a rut this happens to me everybody yeah

1602
01:46:42.34 --> 01:46:45.46
happens to me but I only know what I can tell you about me and then as I get

1603
01:46:45.46 --> 01:46:51.78
trapped in ruts with your jitsu where I get I get stuck in something and I'll

1604
01:46:51.78 --> 01:46:56.78
just go with one move for a long period of time you got to be careful that I

1605
01:46:56.78 --> 01:47:05.14
need to be better about that discipline equals freedom so with you jitsu the

1606
01:47:05.14 --> 01:47:11.22
more disciplined you are in training the more freedom you have on the mat so

1607
01:47:11.22 --> 01:47:16.66
the more you train the more you work the more you drill the more you can move

1608
01:47:16.66 --> 01:47:21.70
the more you can escape the more you can create the more you can finish you

1609
01:47:21.70 --> 01:47:26.02
and not to mention the fear that it eliminates because like you know I'll

1610
01:47:26.02 --> 01:47:28.86
like let's say you're not that discipline you take two weeks off a lot of

1611
01:47:28.86 --> 01:47:32.22
time when you come back from that two weeks like you have that added element of

1612
01:47:32.22 --> 01:47:37.94
nervousness like dang am I gonna gas or am I gonna get you know tapped out in front

1613
01:47:37.94 --> 01:47:41.98
of everybody when you know when you know maybe there's a higher expectation on

1614
01:47:41.98 --> 01:47:53.14
me or something like that yeah no I don't have that yeah part of it though

1615
01:47:53.14 --> 01:47:58.66
for sure but I would say the number one philosophical lesson I guess is

1616
01:47:58.66 --> 01:48:04.50
the philosophical lesson is the same thing that I learned from combat and that's

1617
01:48:04.50 --> 01:48:10.10
humility in jitsu is absolutely one of the most humbling experiences in the

1618
01:48:10.10 --> 01:48:13.62
world and we've actually I got people now that have started jiu jitsu

1619
01:48:13.62 --> 01:48:19.66
because the podcast and they say oh I just did my first jiu jitsu class damn

1620
01:48:19.66 --> 01:48:25.98
that was humbling it is extremely humbling you're gonna get be you're never

1621
01:48:25.98 --> 01:48:30.02
gonna know everything you're always gonna be learning that there's other ways

1622
01:48:30.02 --> 01:48:36.42
to do things and somebody that just started can come up with amazing techniques

1623
01:48:36.42 --> 01:48:43.18
and that's humbling and there's other martial arts that have better moves

1624
01:48:43.18 --> 01:48:47.50
that you need to pay attention to like wrestling has better take downs like

1625
01:48:47.50 --> 01:48:52.46
sombo with the leg locks and catch wrestling some of those things that are

1626
01:48:52.46 --> 01:48:56.06
better moves and you need to apply those and guess what you still need to know

1627
01:48:56.06 --> 01:49:01.98
how to strike because it can be hard to take people down so you know how to

1628
01:49:01.98 --> 01:49:06.10
how to strike and you can't be cocky and you can't be over confident because

1629
01:49:06.10 --> 01:49:14.42
the bottom line is in jiu jitsu you will get beat and you will get beat by

1630
01:49:14.42 --> 01:49:22.50
smaller guys by weaker guys by older guys you're gonna get beat and there's

1631
01:49:22.50 --> 01:49:30.90
somebody that's better than you and if you don't like that or if your ego

1632
01:49:30.90 --> 01:49:38.90
doesn't like that then you gotta find a new game to play yeah because you need

1633
01:49:38.90 --> 01:49:46.42
to find a softer game or an easier game because jiu jitsu is honest yeah and

1634
01:49:46.42 --> 01:49:51.50
you cannot escape that and that's as it should be and it's of course this

1635
01:49:51.50 --> 01:49:57.78
philosophical this philosophy is something that I definitely carried over to

1636
01:49:57.78 --> 01:50:03.14
combat and carry over to when I talk to businesses and carry over to life you

1637
01:50:03.14 --> 01:50:06.74
can't be over confident you can't be over confident you're never gonna think

1638
01:50:06.74 --> 01:50:12.06
you know everything you have to respect the enemy that's part of humility you

1639
01:50:12.06 --> 01:50:14.94
got to respect your if you're not humble you don't respect your enemy you don't

1640
01:50:14.94 --> 01:50:23.58
respect your opponent you don't respect your competitor and if you don't that's

1641
01:50:23.58 --> 01:50:28.14
when you're gonna get caught so to me humility is the most important thing

1642
01:50:28.14 --> 01:50:35.86
that jiu jitsu teaches you yeah and you know it's kind of a can be kind of

1643
01:50:35.86 --> 01:50:42.02
but not a trick yeah I'll have a call to the tricks because okay you got

1644
01:50:42.02 --> 01:50:46.02
it you got to maintain the humility right but that humility will be tested if

1645
01:50:46.02 --> 01:50:50.74
you stick with it so I don't tell you a little quick story about that test being

1646
01:50:50.74 --> 01:50:58.02
stood upon me it was like a little after I got my purple belt I was really

1647
01:50:58.02 --> 01:51:03.82
like really hit my stride I was competing a lot in winning and you were

1648
01:51:03.82 --> 01:51:07.58
trained with me a lot back yes that was that was right at that time when I was

1649
01:51:07.58 --> 01:51:12.22
training with you and you were you know when I you know if there was a

1650
01:51:12.22 --> 01:51:19.42
little mentorship going on yeah that was the exact time yeah and and I was like

1651
01:51:19.42 --> 01:51:22.86
yeah I started to kind of you know give me into my own height you know like oh

1652
01:51:22.86 --> 01:51:30.10
I'm the man not outwardly but on the inside and just fun jiu jitsu man gets

1653
01:51:30.10 --> 01:51:35.30
cocky on the inside yeah and here's thing a lot of people that's how you know

1654
01:51:35.30 --> 01:51:38.34
it in fact a little bit of that is good because you get a confidence that

1655
01:51:38.34 --> 01:51:42.98
hunger to even learn more and be better so I had that and then Greg and

1656
01:51:42.98 --> 01:51:47.10
rolled with Greg since I did know him as good but I knew him but not as good as I

1657
01:51:47.10 --> 01:51:50.62
do now and last time I wanted to say the last time I rolled with him I was a

1658
01:51:50.62 --> 01:51:56.06
white belt long time ago and he just would destroy me so I was like Greg's like oh

1659
01:51:56.06 --> 01:51:58.86
yeah you know congratulations you know you've been winning and stuff like that

1660
01:51:58.86 --> 01:52:02.46
was like oh yeah he's like all right yeah let's roll so I'm like I let me

1661
01:52:02.46 --> 01:52:07.34
chill yeah I'm thinking in my mind yeah I've been winning here let me go

1662
01:52:07.34 --> 01:52:10.74
ahead and show you my new stuff you know it's gonna show Greg in my own

1663
01:52:10.74 --> 01:52:16.02
mind yeah and Greg took me like I was a white belt again immediately the kind

1664
01:52:16.02 --> 01:52:19.50
where he literally nothing I did work and everything he did work there's like

1665
01:52:19.50 --> 01:52:23.22
it's like he did a step one step two step three tap me out step one

1666
01:52:23.22 --> 01:52:30.34
step two set tap me out and that was the time where I got put from like the

1667
01:52:30.34 --> 01:52:34.06
top of the mountain in my own head right to the bottom of the mountain literally

1668
01:52:34.06 --> 01:52:37.50
to the bottom not to not almost at the bottom to the bottom of the mountain yeah

1669
01:52:37.50 --> 01:52:42.06
that's that's it's actually it's actually so good when that happens and

1670
01:52:42.06 --> 01:52:47.70
and actually it's something I occasionally do you get to super humbling occasionally

1671
01:52:47.70 --> 01:52:55.54
you get someone that is really really good and they don't recognize they don't

1672
01:52:55.54 --> 01:52:59.54
come up against people all the time that are they don't come up against

1673
01:52:59.54 --> 01:53:05.54
people very often that are better than them yeah most people in the beginning

1674
01:53:05.54 --> 01:53:10.30
you have you have several years of of being beat down but occasionally

1675
01:53:10.30 --> 01:53:13.74
you get something that's a great wrestler or maybe they were a judo player or

1676
01:53:13.74 --> 01:53:16.46
something so they come into the game or they're just super strong or they're

1677
01:53:16.46 --> 01:53:20.58
just a freak athlete and so they very quickly you know in a matter of six

1678
01:53:20.58 --> 01:53:24.54
months to a year all of a sudden they're doing really well yeah sometimes those

1679
01:53:24.54 --> 01:53:28.54
people sometimes those people mentally they might be good at your jitzie but

1680
01:53:28.54 --> 01:53:33.74
they don't they don't mentally get it and they become really bullies and that's

1681
01:53:33.74 --> 01:53:37.02
that's that's one of the it doesn't happen that often like I said but it

1682
01:53:37.02 --> 01:53:40.38
doesn't occasionally happen where you get somebody that just is a dominant

1683
01:53:40.38 --> 01:53:45.42
force they don't get humble enough and and they don't because even if you

1684
01:53:45.42 --> 01:53:48.70
don't actually get humbled jiu jitsu normally in the beginning you learn

1685
01:53:48.70 --> 01:53:53.22
like oh because one of the things I say to people is I'm not you know because

1686
01:53:53.22 --> 01:53:57.50
I can tap you but doesn't mean that I'm a better human than you just means I

1687
01:53:57.50 --> 01:54:01.58
train more jiu jitsu than you this you know what I mean that's all it means and

1688
01:54:01.58 --> 01:54:05.10
that means that someone else has trained in jiu jiu more than me and they

1689
01:54:05.10 --> 01:54:09.66
can beat me and that's just what it is but sometimes people think that because

1690
01:54:09.66 --> 01:54:15.42
they can tap somebody out that they're better than them yeah as a human yeah

1691
01:54:15.42 --> 01:54:19.42
there is a spirit and that's not a good attitude to have that's not what you

1692
01:54:19.42 --> 01:54:22.62
jiu jitsu should be about yeah and those guys a lot of times because they

1693
01:54:22.62 --> 01:54:27.34
and this is just kind of a one way to put it they don't pay their dues so to speak

1694
01:54:27.34 --> 01:54:30.38
you know like a normal way they don't get the humility lesson over and over and

1695
01:54:30.38 --> 01:54:33.90
over again they get it like a few times within the overcomment quickly yeah and

1696
01:54:33.90 --> 01:54:40.70
it out ways that way yeah so you gotta be careful of that yeah just just be just

1697
01:54:40.70 --> 01:54:43.90
be careful that if you're if you're a person that's naturally really a depth of

1698
01:54:43.90 --> 01:54:49.90
jiu jitsu make sure you're not getting turning into a bully yeah and a lot of

1699
01:54:49.90 --> 01:54:52.78
times that can block you from learning oh definitely block you because it's like

1700
01:54:52.78 --> 01:54:55.98
why would I why would I start learning all this weirdo game like if you're

1701
01:54:55.98 --> 01:55:00.38
strong wrestler like why would I start learning bottom game yeah if when I'm

1702
01:55:00.38 --> 01:55:03.34
killing with all this other stuff I mean listen because there's someone that's a better

1703
01:55:03.34 --> 01:55:07.10
wrestler than you yeah that's why or just knows the combination because a lot of times

1704
01:55:07.82 --> 01:55:13.02
certain guys they'll they'll know the combo to beat wrestling yeah without having to do

1705
01:55:13.02 --> 01:55:18.54
wrestling yeah make some guys that they're just like that you know so part of it

1706
01:55:18.54 --> 01:55:25.34
jiu jitsu okay next question have you ever been so dug in on a solution or an

1707
01:55:25.34 --> 01:55:29.82
opinion that it felt impossible to admit that you were in fact wrong

1708
01:55:29.82 --> 01:55:36.38
so I actually almost gave up on this question and and

1709
01:55:37.02 --> 01:55:43.98
because it's been I learned this lesson a long time ago that again the humility that you

1710
01:55:43.98 --> 01:55:52.38
get from jiu jitsu and from combat and from life is that I very seldom dig in on

1711
01:55:52.38 --> 01:55:56.62
something that I'm not 100% sure of yeah and and which means I don't dig in on a

1712
01:55:56.62 --> 01:56:00.30
lot because I'm not a 100% sure of much right who can be a 100% sure of a lot of things

1713
01:56:01.34 --> 01:56:05.66
and when I do do that it's not that hard for me to realize that I'm wrong

1714
01:56:05.66 --> 01:56:08.70
stifle my ego admit it in change course it's not that big of a deal to me

1715
01:56:11.02 --> 01:56:15.98
when I like I said when I do dig in on a subject or on a decision it's because I know

1716
01:56:17.82 --> 01:56:22.78
like almost to a 100% certainty that I'm right otherwise I'm gonna leave myself a little bit of an

1717
01:56:22.78 --> 01:56:29.26
out I'm not gonna just dig in on things that I can't be positive about because why

1718
01:56:29.26 --> 01:56:36.46
would I why would I do that now when I end up being wrong if I do take a stance on

1719
01:56:36.46 --> 01:56:40.14
something it's no big deal I'm gonna use that as an opportunity to show that I'm

1720
01:56:40.14 --> 01:56:43.82
humble and show that I can admit when I'm wrong I'm gonna take advantage of a good

1721
01:56:43.82 --> 01:56:51.26
I'm wrong good and you know so I would say just keep your options open keep an

1722
01:56:51.26 --> 01:56:59.58
open mind when you feel yourself or your ego is digging in just check yourself

1723
01:57:00.70 --> 01:57:10.54
and admit that you're wrong and move on and one thing I think that happens with people is people

1724
01:57:10.54 --> 01:57:20.22
think that digging in and having a strong 100% opinion makes them a pure stronger or it makes

1725
01:57:20.22 --> 01:57:25.90
their idea pure stronger but I don't think so I'm not saying to be wishy washy on stuff

1726
01:57:25.90 --> 01:57:29.34
I'm just saying I don't have an open mind because I think that's the ultimate strength

1727
01:57:31.42 --> 01:57:36.38
that's kind of my opinion I mean the last time I came close to digging in I was advising a company

1728
01:57:36.94 --> 01:57:42.94
and they were going through some rough a little bit of a rough patch and they started multiple

1729
01:57:42.94 --> 01:57:47.58
initiatives to try and turn some some things around and one of the initiatives

1730
01:57:47.58 --> 01:57:53.50
of all the initiatives there was a couple that the CEO wanted done immediately and two of

1731
01:57:53.50 --> 01:58:00.06
those initiatives when I looked at them I thought that they were redundant and so I said look

1732
01:58:00.06 --> 01:58:04.86
I wouldn't waste I wouldn't do both these initiatives just pick one I think this one's the

1733
01:58:04.86 --> 01:58:09.42
better one just do this one and I think it'll cover the problem and I convinced them

1734
01:58:10.14 --> 01:58:13.26
and it was pretty easy to convince them because they were had limited resources at the time

1735
01:58:13.26 --> 01:58:16.94
and limited assets so it wasn't like they had a bunch of stuff to spread around

1736
01:58:16.94 --> 01:58:20.62
but he was pretty sad on it but I convinced them otherwise and he agreed and within a matter of

1737
01:58:20.62 --> 01:58:25.98
days it started to look like I was wrong and it started to look like both systems were going to

1738
01:58:25.98 --> 01:58:35.26
be needed to solve that specific issue so I didn't like wait I didn't say oh I hope that things go

1739
01:58:35.26 --> 01:58:39.50
I said look hey I think I was wrong about this I think you were right let's get the other

1740
01:58:39.50 --> 01:58:45.82
initiative going and let's get this problem covered and that's it and I'm telling you he didn't

1741
01:58:45.82 --> 01:58:52.86
lose respect for me because I said hey I'm wrong after a few days of watching what the results are

1742
01:58:52.86 --> 01:59:00.14
and making an early decision he actually thought it was awesome and he knew he's like hey I wish

1743
01:59:00.14 --> 01:59:04.06
everyone could admit when they were wrong like that it would make everything around here so much

1744
01:59:04.06 --> 01:59:08.30
easier and I said well that's why I'm here in the first place right is to help with that so

1745
01:59:10.54 --> 01:59:15.42
just be conscious when you dig in you know because when you dig in you're actually when you

1746
01:59:15.42 --> 01:59:22.06
dig in you're taking away your ability to maneuver oh yeah you don't want to do that it's good so

1747
01:59:22.94 --> 01:59:32.06
so watch out now should I read this question because this is a question for echo Charles

1748
01:59:32.62 --> 01:59:36.86
so that means I get you well it's two questions actually but I put them together because they're

1749
01:59:36.86 --> 01:59:44.70
pretty close jocca willing what brought you and echo Charles together can we get the backstory there

1750
01:59:44.70 --> 01:59:52.22
I like the chemistry echo Charles question for you to answer on jocco podcast what have you

1751
01:59:52.22 --> 02:00:01.58
learned from jocco and how has your life changed since this is echo's first response to a question

1752
02:00:03.82 --> 02:00:12.06
don't screw it up here we go I'll tackle you yeah yeah of course which is funny because that's kind

1753
02:00:12.06 --> 02:00:16.46
of how what brought us together we're a part of what brought us together and I think it's good

1754
02:00:16.46 --> 02:00:20.70
that I answer this part because you probably remember a lot less of it so

1755
02:00:24.86 --> 02:00:31.74
I would say it was oh six I'd seen you like the first you know whatever within the first year

1756
02:00:31.74 --> 02:00:36.70
of joining with Dean in 05 but I didn't know you didn't talk to you nothing like that I just

1757
02:00:36.70 --> 02:00:43.98
had heard of you from Dean and then in like 06 when we moved over to the boxing club I rolled

1758
02:00:43.98 --> 02:00:50.22
with you one time I was still a white belt and so that could have been still 05 I don't know and then

1759
02:00:50.22 --> 02:00:56.22
you know you beat me up and you kind of you were just more like this stoic guy basically I would

1760
02:00:56.22 --> 02:01:01.34
imagine the same guy that people interpret you to be from the outside you know kind of like not

1761
02:01:01.34 --> 02:01:06.86
intense but just real like yeah just real matter of fact you know so you beat me up or whatever and

1762
02:01:06.86 --> 02:01:11.42
then I was so I since I had already heard of you were Dean's black belt and you know all this stuff

1763
02:01:11.42 --> 02:01:16.46
that I was like yeah that's about right you know he's you know good you do whatever beat me up

1764
02:01:16.46 --> 02:01:20.78
but that wasn't really saying much because everyone was beating me up and then time went on I didn't

1765
02:01:20.78 --> 02:01:26.78
see you for a while and then when I started to kind of get lost I was trained with Brent

1766
02:01:26.78 --> 02:01:32.78
Brent yeah I was training with him and then with Alias a little bit and then I would come back

1767
02:01:33.50 --> 02:01:38.46
I was competing and then you were just around for whatever reason and then yeah I just started

1768
02:01:38.46 --> 02:01:44.06
training with you and I think that's the one we opened victory right yes is around the same time yeah

1769
02:01:44.06 --> 02:01:51.66
yeah exactly and then um yeah well funny is that you never came off like once like like new you like

1770
02:01:51.66 --> 02:01:56.22
immediately you never came off as this super intense person like it was more like you were just

1771
02:01:56.22 --> 02:02:03.66
sarcastic like well you know like any other like any other of my friends but you could still always

1772
02:02:03.66 --> 02:02:07.82
tell that there are something behind the scenes you know you know Darrogens said like he's seeing you

1773
02:02:07.82 --> 02:02:12.86
and he was like there's I don't know this guy you know it's kind of got that same feeling but you

1774
02:02:12.86 --> 02:02:20.54
were always just like oh yeah this real matter fact but fun funny like kind of person whatever

1775
02:02:20.54 --> 02:02:26.62
like but when I say matter fact I mean like um like that one this one tournament when uh it was kind

1776
02:02:26.62 --> 02:02:31.10
of later where I lost two genre Roberts and you got me with a go-go plata and you know when you

1777
02:02:31.10 --> 02:02:36.86
lose in jujitsu training and that was the first time I lost in since I went advance you know because

1778
02:02:36.86 --> 02:02:42.94
those doing a lot of no-gui I had never lost and genre Roberts gets me with a go-go plata so instead of

1779
02:02:42.94 --> 02:02:46.38
you saying hey you know it's okay here nothing like that you send me a text you're sitting across

1780
02:02:46.38 --> 02:02:51.26
the arena you're right there you send me a text hey you got caught with a go-go that's got a sting

1781
02:02:51.26 --> 02:02:57.02
that's not a tournament it's not practice you can say that could stuff it was like oh whatever

1782
02:02:57.02 --> 02:03:03.18
but I think that um that you know training together and just kind of getting you you you kind of

1783
02:03:03.18 --> 02:03:09.42
had that thing that you could say that kind of stuff because really it's not that serious you know

1784
02:03:09.42 --> 02:03:14.22
yeah when I don't think I don't there's there's not many people who could have conveyed that though

1785
02:03:14.22 --> 02:03:20.14
you know it came it I think it had to come from you anyway so yeah that's kind of how

1786
02:03:21.42 --> 02:03:29.58
we met and then um kind of after a while how did the idea of a podcast come up because we we kind

1787
02:03:29.58 --> 02:03:35.50
of talked about that a little bit before I kind of forget the formation but it was in my mind

1788
02:03:35.50 --> 02:03:40.22
when I went on jailroguins I think we had talked about hey you know we should do something I think

1789
02:03:40.22 --> 02:03:45.02
you said to me like hey you should do it and so when I went on jailroguins and he said you should do a

1790
02:03:45.02 --> 02:03:50.38
podcast I think what Tim Ferriss said hey you should do a podcast and then I kind of be you being

1791
02:03:50.38 --> 02:03:56.22
a techie sound guy video guy I just said hey do you know how to make a podcast yeah that's right

1792
02:03:56.22 --> 02:03:59.98
I just said hey how do you you know how to make a podcast so I need to make one yeah

1793
02:03:59.98 --> 02:04:05.42
yeah yeah because everything to be just a total caveman right get how do you do I need a tape recorder

1794
02:04:05.42 --> 02:04:11.02
what do I need you know that's what my answer then you said yeah I know I know how to do that I could

1795
02:04:11.02 --> 02:04:18.22
make that happen and then you said it'd be cool instead of just you sitting there talking if you

1796
02:04:18.22 --> 02:04:22.06
had someone to talk to and I said yeah you're right that would be cool and then you said it'd be cool

1797
02:04:22.06 --> 02:04:30.30
if it was me yeah well my my selling point was that strange if it's just you right just sitting there

1798
02:04:30.30 --> 02:04:34.46
you know it's it's more strange and it's better if you have someone to kind of bounce things off

1799
02:04:34.46 --> 02:04:39.02
okay especially someone who can kind of be like oh I'm just every day guy like so I can like

1800
02:04:39.02 --> 02:04:42.06
ask questions that kind of reiterate the point right just someone who might not get it

1801
02:04:43.10 --> 02:04:49.34
yeah I had an awful lot out you know in my mind I did anyway but yeah then yeah obviously Joe

1802
02:04:49.34 --> 02:04:55.34
Rogan was kind of the tipping point when he suggested it yeah yeah no that was a good gradient

1803
02:04:55.34 --> 02:04:59.82
side from Joe Rogan and I'm glad he did and I'm glad you did and look at we did

1804
02:04:59.82 --> 02:05:07.82
make this podcast happen so to answer the question what have I learned and this is interesting

1805
02:05:07.82 --> 02:05:12.86
because I asked myself this exact same question like a week ago because I am literally a different

1806
02:05:12.86 --> 02:05:18.54
person in ways that kind of are kind of surprising in a way so I'd say the first thing that's kind

1807
02:05:18.54 --> 02:05:25.98
of kind of not that surprising but it's it's very prevalent is when people blame when I see people

1808
02:05:25.98 --> 02:05:31.26
blaming other people or blaming me or I feel the compulsion to blame someone else it stands out

1809
02:05:31.26 --> 02:05:37.58
like a sore thumb almost like if if I've been feeling that and it like almost like if I want to say

1810
02:05:37.58 --> 02:05:43.10
something to to indicate that I'm going to blame someone or something it's almost like a red flag like

1811
02:05:43.10 --> 02:05:48.86
I'm not allowed to do that in my own mind it's like it's hard in fast rule and like I said they just

1812
02:05:48.86 --> 02:05:54.78
stand out like a sore thumb everywhere though on TV you know the guy not even my conversation oh I

1813
02:05:54.78 --> 02:05:59.66
see what you're doing right there you know so it's like it's like your whole way of life in that

1814
02:05:59.66 --> 02:06:06.06
regard is just shifted extreme ownership and the awareness of that seeing it and other people

1815
02:06:06.06 --> 02:06:10.62
or lack of it and other people definitely stands out like crazy once you start thinking about it

1816
02:06:10.62 --> 02:06:16.14
yeah and I have the luxury of being around you talking about these things talking about examples of it

1817
02:06:16.70 --> 02:06:21.74
every week right so throughout the week I'm like I can't even help but notice it you know and it's

1818
02:06:21.74 --> 02:06:26.46
right it helps man because it applies to everyone and everything like most relationships are going to

1819
02:06:26.46 --> 02:06:33.02
apply these principles you know if you're involved in them so yeah it's all automatic now so so

1820
02:06:33.02 --> 02:06:40.14
when it comes to ownership and really blaming myself if anyone and focusing on my responsibility

1821
02:06:40.14 --> 02:06:45.02
in any scenario whatever it comes automatic now I would say so huge stuff I mean whether I make

1822
02:06:45.02 --> 02:06:50.86
the right choices that's always going to be working probably progress I think but as far as that attitude

1823
02:06:50.86 --> 02:07:00.38
it's automatic now that's awesome and then in regards to okay so I've always been into working

1824
02:07:00.38 --> 02:07:09.02
out and so me not feeling like working out is I've always felt like working out so

1825
02:07:11.58 --> 02:07:16.62
as far as not feeling like it that wasn't really a factor but in a bunch of other things in life

1826
02:07:16.62 --> 02:07:24.30
it was a factor and so so you're saying we're not feeling like doing this and why you're

1827
02:07:24.30 --> 02:07:29.34
seeing yeah like oh I got it I got to go to the post office today and that's on the low end and then

1828
02:07:29.34 --> 02:07:34.94
or the other one is I don't know I get it I don't know something more important right but maybe

1829
02:07:34.94 --> 02:07:40.38
I'll wait a wait till really the last minute or we know procrastination type stuff so you're getting

1830
02:07:40.38 --> 02:07:46.38
into the here and now yeah and not feeling like it that means absolutely nothing something needs

1831
02:07:46.38 --> 02:07:52.38
to be done and I don't feel like it and you know how like you have certain ideas already and then

1832
02:07:52.38 --> 02:07:57.02
other ideas are introduced and then those ideas kind of mingle with your existing ideas and they

1833
02:07:57.02 --> 02:08:03.42
formulate this whole new course of action right so the not feeling like it is no excuse that idea

1834
02:08:03.42 --> 02:08:10.06
came in and so now like it morphed into this thing like me not feeling like it who guess what I'm

1835
02:08:10.06 --> 02:08:15.18
going to do I'm going to do it right so it's almost like this personal challenge now you know and

1836
02:08:15.18 --> 02:08:20.94
man as far as results go and you get everything done I get it so much stuff done and it's not

1837
02:08:20.94 --> 02:08:26.06
some probably compared to you it's nothing but I get stuff done like so many things done during

1838
02:08:26.06 --> 02:08:30.78
the day that I never thought that I could do that many things in a day that's all I'm always looking

1839
02:08:30.78 --> 02:08:35.26
for maybe a rest or a nap or something like that but now everyone's all all be challenging myself

1840
02:08:35.26 --> 02:08:41.10
to do as many things as I can and be like solid and on top of that and you're the one who said this

1841
02:08:41.10 --> 02:08:46.30
was one time one of the things you were kind of tired and you were like you know what what I like

1842
02:08:46.30 --> 02:08:50.70
this I like just grinding and grinding and grinding and then at the end of the day when I go

1843
02:08:50.70 --> 02:08:55.10
it go to bed where my head just crashes into the pillow I like that and I was like yeah that sounds

1844
02:08:55.10 --> 02:09:03.82
nice you know so when I approach things like that now and also I think of all the good things that have

1845
02:09:03.82 --> 02:09:08.46
been done like great things and just good things whatever if these people didn't do it because they

1846
02:09:08.46 --> 02:09:14.86
didn't feel like it like these things when they got done you know so if you got stuff to do

1847
02:09:15.90 --> 02:09:21.74
you do it whether you feel like it or not that's what I have for myself now and the last thing

1848
02:09:24.14 --> 02:09:30.22
is I kind of knew this but man it's so clear now that you can get certain messages and

1849
02:09:30.22 --> 02:09:36.70
information and tips and tactics and stuff from from people or the internet or books or whatever

1850
02:09:36.70 --> 02:09:44.22
but if you're not ready to accept them you just won't accept them or they'll just go in one

1851
02:09:44.22 --> 02:09:47.66
year and out the other and a lot of time that has to do with who's saying it so

1852
02:09:49.58 --> 02:09:54.22
if like I don't know your neighbor some goof off he's drinking a beer smoking a cigarette

1853
02:09:54.22 --> 02:09:58.94
he's like hey guess what you know you should do this and it's that it can be this great advice

1854
02:09:58.94 --> 02:10:02.46
being like I'm not going to listen to you I'm not even a listen to you I'm not even going to

1855
02:10:02.46 --> 02:10:07.02
get past that part the fact that you're the one that saying this already walled me off from what

1856
02:10:07.02 --> 02:10:13.98
you have to say and that's natural I think but a lot of these things like you're reading these old

1857
02:10:13.98 --> 02:10:18.78
books that have these messages that you've been saying so it's not new stuff and a lot of stuff

1858
02:10:18.78 --> 02:10:23.98
I heard that take responsibility for for your actions yeah that's not new you know if I

1859
02:10:23.98 --> 02:10:28.62
bust out hey hey you guy on the street take responsibility for your actions if something comes

1860
02:10:28.62 --> 02:10:33.02
up I'm just saying he'd be like yeah that's nothing new I wouldn't stand out but for some reason when

1861
02:10:33.02 --> 02:10:40.14
you're saying it get you thinking yeah let me take responsibility you know so that so yeah it's say

1862
02:10:41.66 --> 02:10:47.10
when it comes to listening to you this podcast all the you know the answers you have for these

1863
02:10:47.10 --> 02:10:55.58
questions and any questions I even have it seems like it it comes and a process it way more readily

1864
02:10:55.58 --> 02:11:04.46
than you know memes on Facebook or wherever you know say that that's awesome pretty true that's

1865
02:11:04.46 --> 02:11:10.86
that's really cool that's that's great to hear and I've I mean I've definitely seen a transition

1866
02:11:11.74 --> 02:11:18.94
in everything you're doing I mean everything you're doing is spot on yeah and that's legit you know

1867
02:11:18.94 --> 02:11:26.06
it's legit to see it's legit to see someone moving towards their potential as a human yeah that's

1868
02:11:26.06 --> 02:11:34.78
awesome to see yeah and another thing that kind of I came to as not a conclusion but it which is

1869
02:11:34.78 --> 02:11:39.34
a result it's not a direct like you didn't tell me this but this is what all my existing thoughts

1870
02:11:39.34 --> 02:11:46.46
mixed with all your input kind of arrived at one of the things is that it's up to you it's up to me

1871
02:11:46.46 --> 02:11:55.90
what I spend my time doing totally up to me and it's up to me what I feel my head with so you know

1872
02:11:55.90 --> 02:12:01.02
I like I used to have these shows that I love to I love to watch Hawaii 50 and Shark Tank and that's

1873
02:12:01.02 --> 02:12:08.22
kind of it I don't really watch that much TV but those do that's maybe you know two hours or so

1874
02:12:08.22 --> 02:12:13.10
that I could be reading something that's gonna help me through the rest of my life or getting better

1875
02:12:13.10 --> 02:12:19.26
at something that's gonna help my you know relationships or career or something like that and I

1876
02:12:19.26 --> 02:12:26.54
use that example because that seems pretty pretty like not in consequence because it's only two

1877
02:12:26.54 --> 02:12:30.54
shows it's not like I spent 10 hours a day watching TV it's just two shows because no harm in that

1878
02:12:30.54 --> 02:12:35.58
right but it's that's up to me I'm not missing out by missing Hawaii 50 not missing out that's not

1879
02:12:35.58 --> 02:12:39.82
gonna affect my life in any negative way in the future at all I don't want to affect my life in

1880
02:12:39.82 --> 02:12:47.18
any way actually but if I read something useful educate myself in you know whatever arena that's

1881
02:12:47.18 --> 02:12:53.66
gonna improve my interests or my or my relationship or something like that that will that will help

1882
02:12:53.66 --> 02:12:58.06
me yeah no I've that's one of the things I've noticed when I'd show show up at the studio

1883
02:12:58.86 --> 02:13:03.90
and you'd say all's reading this book today about you know how we could get this to sound better

1884
02:13:03.90 --> 02:13:07.90
and I read this thing about you know you're coming back and me with all this information

1885
02:13:07.90 --> 02:13:14.38
and it was something that just transitioned in your brain where you said you know what I could be

1886
02:13:14.38 --> 02:13:22.06
watching TV in wasting my mind or I could be applying myself and learning yeah and that's

1887
02:13:23.02 --> 02:13:27.18
that makes a huge difference yeah this is what one of the things I read actually

1888
02:13:28.62 --> 02:13:34.54
and I read it on I want to say Wikipedia this specific thing but there's this this automatic

1889
02:13:34.54 --> 02:13:41.82
way of thinking and it's called hyperbolic discounting right and all that it all that means is

1890
02:13:42.62 --> 02:13:46.70
you choose immediate payoffs versus and I kind of mentioned this before you choose immediate

1891
02:13:46.70 --> 02:13:51.74
payoffs versus long-term payoffs right and it's there for a reason survival mechanism and all these

1892
02:13:51.74 --> 02:13:58.14
ways but it's all that exists for an you know an environment that's not current so if you can

1893
02:13:58.14 --> 02:14:04.38
basically be aware of that and combat that where don't do the immediate payoff things so

1894
02:14:04.38 --> 02:14:08.94
just take take what you're about to do evaluated is this going to help me other than the pleasure

1895
02:14:08.94 --> 02:14:17.42
that I think well whether that in regards to food drinking TV shows like if you watch reality TV

1896
02:14:17.42 --> 02:14:24.06
check yourself on now and ask yourself is this going to help me in the future and typically

1897
02:14:24.06 --> 02:14:29.66
that that answer for those types of things you're going to be know and then consider in alternative

1898
02:14:29.66 --> 02:14:35.10
that you can do and a lot of the stuff can be pleasurable that will help you in the future and it's

1899
02:14:35.10 --> 02:14:40.70
totally up to you it's totally up to you why not make the good choice yeah and the payoff not only

1900
02:14:40.70 --> 02:14:46.86
is it bigger it lasts longer yeah and the immediate payoff is gone it's just a memory

1901
02:14:48.46 --> 02:14:56.30
awesome that's awesome to hear and and actually we got that next comment here is sort of the same

1902
02:14:56.30 --> 02:15:02.62
vein that's coming from and we get a bunch of you know emails but I just thought this one was

1903
02:15:02.62 --> 02:15:08.22
was interesting to hear someone kind of talking about their transition here she says I'm one of

1904
02:15:08.22 --> 02:15:15.90
many many people who live their lives as they think they should and end up mid 40s lost

1905
02:15:15.90 --> 02:15:22.78
chubby and depressed I definitely don't hear a worship you but I'm truly grateful

1906
02:15:22.78 --> 02:15:29.58
for your online presence I now get up at 5 a.m. daily and I screened grab my phone every morning

1907
02:15:29.58 --> 02:15:34.62
as the alarm goes off and post that shot with another shot from my walk a few minutes in

1908
02:15:35.42 --> 02:15:41.58
I walk for an hour daily and it started stretching daily for an hour but this doesn't stop there

1909
02:15:41.58 --> 02:15:46.46
I now have a bunch of friends who are getting up early and going for a walk or going to the gym

1910
02:15:46.46 --> 02:15:53.66
getting after it as you say we are all noticing an improvement in our lives so we might not be

1911
02:15:53.66 --> 02:15:59.90
military or police we are not planning on becoming jiu jitsu champions at this stage we're just

1912
02:15:59.90 --> 02:16:07.82
people who lost themselves lost their way who are finding their way back in part thanks to you

1913
02:16:09.10 --> 02:16:14.06
I credit you at least twice a week and tell people to find you on Twitter I had to write here

1914
02:16:14.06 --> 02:16:19.42
because there's no way I could fit this into 140 characters and thanks to Tim and Joe for having

1915
02:16:19.42 --> 02:16:25.10
you on their shows that's where I found you have a great day so it really cool you know really cool

1916
02:16:25.10 --> 02:16:32.46
to hear that really great to get that feedback and you know this is what I like about it

1917
02:16:33.10 --> 02:16:36.86
but first of all you know I thank people who spread the words and it's really good to hear

1918
02:16:36.86 --> 02:16:41.50
that feedback it fires me up to hear the feedback and when people say I motivate them I'm always

1919
02:16:41.50 --> 02:16:47.10
like you motivate me you know that motivates me that you're out there getting up at 5 a.m.

1920
02:16:47.10 --> 02:16:53.02
and turning your life around I think that's awesome and also what I what I liked about this

1921
02:16:53.02 --> 02:16:58.22
was they pointed out that this isn't just military or police or jiu jitsu players it's for

1922
02:16:58.22 --> 02:17:05.66
pretty much anybody in any station in life and any job any age man or woman any country and

1923
02:17:05.66 --> 02:17:11.82
as a matter of fact I was in England and my wife from England and when I was in England I went and saw

1924
02:17:11.82 --> 02:17:17.82
one of my wife's friends who I'm friends with the husband and you know here's this woman

1925
02:17:19.34 --> 02:17:26.78
who's I don't know 40 something years old she's lives in England she's got three kids

1926
02:17:28.06 --> 02:17:33.66
she's like couldn't be any further detached from me in my life

1927
02:17:33.66 --> 02:17:39.10
and when I was I was hanging out with her husband in London before we went to their house

1928
02:17:39.10 --> 02:17:43.42
and he said when we got on the train to go to his house he said listen you got to be ready

1929
02:17:43.42 --> 02:17:49.98
and I'm like for what and he says my wife loves your podcast and I said really

1930
02:17:49.98 --> 02:17:54.54
and he said no no no I'm serious she loves your podcast and we have dinner night she's going to

1931
02:17:54.54 --> 02:17:58.54
ask you questions all my long she's been asking me the questions that she was going to ask you

1932
02:17:58.54 --> 02:18:04.78
and so I showed up and seriously it was great she was asking me all these detailed questions about

1933
02:18:04.78 --> 02:18:09.90
everything and it was really cool because I realized that this I mean this like I said this person

1934
02:18:09.90 --> 02:18:15.90
doesn't do due to jitsu doesn't you know doesn't do anything that I do nothing

1935
02:18:17.02 --> 02:18:21.82
and yet she was had all these lessons learned and all these things she had taken away and

1936
02:18:21.82 --> 02:18:25.66
it was awesome to see that and it was an interesting too because that's I was talking to her

1937
02:18:25.66 --> 02:18:32.38
it was on a Friday or a Saturday and as I'm talking to her she had listened to the latest podcast

1938
02:18:32.94 --> 02:18:38.94
on the day before and so she was saying to me you know well yesterday you said this and yesterday

1939
02:18:38.94 --> 02:18:45.74
you said that and so in her mind I was talking to her yesterday I was talking to her yesterday

1940
02:18:45.74 --> 02:18:51.18
and that's when I kind of realized that how how impactful is what we talked about where you know

1941
02:18:51.18 --> 02:18:55.42
where the words the podcast words are going directly into your brain and I've had a bunch of

1942
02:18:55.42 --> 02:18:59.02
people say you know oh when you're talking oh you were telling this story and I wanted you to talk

1943
02:18:59.02 --> 02:19:04.38
about this story you know for these are friends of mine and so so I think that's that's really cool

1944
02:19:05.18 --> 02:19:10.70
and I think that's why a lot of people are getting into the game and enjoying it because and you

1945
02:19:10.70 --> 02:19:16.70
just said it and I I say it all the time there's nothing new here and we're not

1946
02:19:17.82 --> 02:19:23.90
given out any ground breaking techniques and there's no miracle drug and there's no three-minute

1947
02:19:23.90 --> 02:19:34.30
exercise that's going to change your life I'm not selling the self-help reach your potential

1948
02:19:35.18 --> 02:19:42.30
through this magical mystery I'm telling people what they already know and we're talking about

1949
02:19:42.30 --> 02:19:48.46
things that people know to be right in their own heads like discipline and hard work and consistency

1950
02:19:48.46 --> 02:19:58.14
those are the things and we all know those things but to everybody that's that's kind of

1951
02:19:58.14 --> 02:20:04.54
known these things for a while but they've recently started to get after it good on you

1952
02:20:05.66 --> 02:20:13.26
yeah and get on that path yeah if it feels like stay on that path that's what I'm talking about

1953
02:20:13.26 --> 02:20:19.50
very cool I feel like like just like how you were saying like we a lot of this we already knew

1954
02:20:19.50 --> 02:20:25.42
we already know about state discipline we already know about all this stuff or whatever but coming from

1955
02:20:25.42 --> 02:20:34.62
you it helps and then on top of that I'm really starting to really understand and feel is that

1956
02:20:34.62 --> 02:20:39.74
you know all like you on Twitter like you engage you know you like someone asks your questions

1957
02:20:39.74 --> 02:20:46.46
it seems like you're engaging a lot more so than if somebody asks me question I'm going to answer

1958
02:20:46.46 --> 02:20:51.50
their question yeah I'm not rude which is it I try to for sure I would imagine you'd be you know

1959
02:20:51.50 --> 02:20:56.86
I have way more than me but kind of as a result of everything I feel like we're all kind of doing

1960
02:20:56.86 --> 02:21:00.78
this together you know you know how the guys done in Australia they'll post all that you know

1961
02:21:00.78 --> 02:21:06.14
a lot of people everyone they're posting there you know 430 a.m. wake up time to do this

1962
02:21:06.14 --> 02:21:10.22
everyone yeah because that's what you did now guess what we're all doing it you know we're all doing

1963
02:21:10.22 --> 02:21:14.62
it you're responding they're responding to you you're responding to them we're reading questions

1964
02:21:14.62 --> 02:21:21.74
from them yeah I think I'm a weird like these are other people yeah and through this weird

1965
02:21:22.62 --> 02:21:27.82
interweb they're actually asking questions from some unknown partner hold we're having a

1966
02:21:27.82 --> 02:21:31.50
conversation basically yeah it's kind of delayed but yeah that's exactly what's going on so

1967
02:21:31.50 --> 02:21:36.38
an example I should have just grabbed my phone and saw the half forget the guy's name but he was like

1968
02:21:36.38 --> 02:21:42.46
hey echo Sunday workout Sunday this was like early this morning maybe late last night whatever

1969
02:21:42.46 --> 02:21:48.78
Sunday workout give me one I need a Sunday workout so I was like oh okay so I gave him the workout it was

1970
02:21:48.78 --> 02:21:58.06
basically two rounds five sets of cleaning clean and press five reps clean and press five times

1971
02:21:58.06 --> 02:22:03.34
and then five burpees that's one set do five sets 45 seconds rest in between rest for two minutes

1972
02:22:03.34 --> 02:22:09.10
and then do five more 45 seconds rest that's it I said use 135 pounds I only said 135 pounds because

1973
02:22:09.10 --> 02:22:12.94
that's what that's the exact thing I do after I live and that's like to me that's the hard

1974
02:22:12.94 --> 02:22:19.10
lifting side that hard but that part's kind of hard to me the metcon the metcon yeah so I'm like

1975
02:22:19.10 --> 02:22:22.94
but I don't know maybe I don't know if I'm in good shape or not as far as that goes so I think

1976
02:22:22.94 --> 02:22:29.66
I say you do it and use that weight but here's the thing if he's smaller I don't know how big he is

1977
02:22:29.66 --> 02:22:33.82
we're just talking on Twitter you know so you know that put the weight didn't really matter

1978
02:22:33.82 --> 02:22:38.54
hopefully scaled it properly or he said later on he was like dang that was pain but I feel great

1979
02:22:38.54 --> 02:22:43.10
I was like solid he said hey but I adjusted the weight so I'm saying okay you know that makes sense

1980
02:22:44.14 --> 02:22:51.02
but my two reasons why I was into that is because I wanted that interaction like hey do my work up

1981
02:22:51.02 --> 02:22:54.46
you know and what I'm gonna do and I thought it was earlier this morning where

1982
02:22:55.82 --> 02:23:01.50
or earlier today I'm gonna send him back say you give me a workout oh nice and I'm gonna do it

1983
02:23:01.50 --> 02:23:05.58
and but make it something at least close to what you do or something you do and I'll give you

1984
02:23:05.58 --> 02:23:10.54
your evaluation you know so hopefully I can get some variety and it'll help that interaction I think

1985
02:23:10.54 --> 02:23:14.94
that's dope yeah like how he actually went and did it yeah I was like heck yeah it's good that

1986
02:23:14.94 --> 02:23:24.78
some barn in Iowa or some yellow it was awesome good deal last question there must be some aspect

1987
02:23:25.58 --> 02:23:30.46
of the Tutsi situation that I don't understand even if I'm on the losing side of the fight I still

1988
02:23:30.46 --> 02:23:37.10
want to go down swing I could tell how much this affected jacco it would suck to be so close to such

1989
02:23:37.10 --> 02:23:49.82
an unjust fight and not be able to do anything about it yes it it is hard to look at that situation

1990
02:23:49.82 --> 02:23:59.90
and really understand it and it's horrible look back at it now and know that we didn't do anything about it

1991
02:23:59.90 --> 02:24:10.06
but what can we do with it how can we apply this to everyday life because I agree with you

1992
02:24:11.50 --> 02:24:19.82
you gotta go down swinging and I'll tell you this if you if you fight with all you've got

1993
02:24:19.82 --> 02:24:34.06
more often than not you go down at all you win but you gotta make that attitude part of your

1994
02:24:34.06 --> 02:24:43.90
everyday life the extra rep the extra mile the extra round the right choices to make yourself

1995
02:24:43.90 --> 02:24:56.54
stronger mentally and physically stand and fight fight against weakness and against fear

1996
02:24:57.50 --> 02:25:06.14
their fight against time and decay fight back go down swing it

1997
02:25:06.14 --> 02:25:17.26
give every day everything you've got and when you face a challenge even something where you

1998
02:25:17.26 --> 02:25:25.66
don't believe you can win maybe to situation where you cannot win but if you can't win

1999
02:25:25.66 --> 02:25:39.26
remember this you have nothing to lose so stand up and go forward and go out in a blaze of glory

2000
02:25:40.94 --> 02:25:48.46
fighting with everything you've got every ounce of energy every beat is sweat and every drop of blood

2001
02:25:48.46 --> 02:26:04.38
to your last breath and then and only then you can stand down and you can put down your

2002
02:26:04.38 --> 02:26:24.30
sword and you can put down your shield and rest in peace and I think that's all I've got for the

2003
02:26:24.30 --> 02:26:32.86
