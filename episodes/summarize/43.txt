You know, we do have a definite tendency to do that in literature or people that write about war, they want to write about, you know, they make everyone look like the best guy ever. But you know, we're just trying to let you know, we hear on, you know, the listeners and the, and the troopers here, we all want to see a little bit more activity. Like I said, it may be even more into tea because it's like, you know, it's like you get into, well, I did. But you know how like you're like, you know, it's a mellow night. The good many of our trenches were directly on filet and if you don't know what that is, on filet is like, if you can imagine a line of people and you are shooting down the line of people and how much more exposed you are in that situation. So we know, I mean we know this is a world war one, we know it's an absolute nightmare. It doesn't matter how good your tactics are, it doesn't matter how good of a leader you are because when we say go you're going to get your troops you're going to do what we say you're going to go over the top of your charge machine guns and guys you're going to get mode down. You know, again, from my experience in the in the in the in the seal teams, you know, when I went in there was no war going on, I kind of thought that there was, but there wasn't. And I was like, I'm going to do like how you do put it on ice and see if I can't get my refresh on, you know, outside it, whatever. He said, you know, you say that, but I've also heard you describe war as horrible and I kind of gave him an answer about, you know, I asked him, I said, hey, if they've never known you, but survived cancer. Now this is a pretty interesting piece where he goes back to New York where like I said he had spent some time there and he's talking a little about what it's like in New York. She'll be like, it's like a comfort zone thing, you know. And some people been like, whoa, some people emailed and said, whoa, is it really like, jocquo, you made this tea? So he's saying, okay, a lot of guys, they're like, hey, you know what, I'm kind of scared. But now what I know is I get to talk to people and I get to get to grow my knowledge from other people who, who can communicate things, who ask really good questions that I got to get research So that's like, you see that, in this modern day, you know, I'm talking about how different it was back then, but maybe it was as different as I think it is. Like theoretically from Amazon's perspective, like the Nazis, they thought, man, these guys are getting after this. Obviously we talked about World War I and the less he's not the only person that felt this way about things and if this wasn't at least a fairly normal attitude to have there's no way that World War I could have continued on the way it did because people would have been saying no this is ridiculous. You know, where, because people on Twitter and stuff, they'll be like, hey, can you just isolate this one? And people are like, I don't know, no time for you. Then, you know, I just want to let you know. This, what happens in the trenches is like a religion, it's like a spiritual thing. And when I meet people, all of a sudden, it's like, it's like friends that you have inside jokes with. And in the meantime, you know, again, I know we got to- I'm going to some highlights, so there's a little bit of a skip, you know, time here as they move towards the front.
