[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 248, with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.
[00:00:08] As the summer of 1970 evolved, the deadly secret war and loused raged into its sixth year.
[00:00:17] The communist NVA and its secret advisors from Russia, China and Cuba, continued supplying
[00:00:22] growing numbers of light and heavy weapons, stated the art anti-aircraft artillery,
[00:00:27] missiles and vehicles. The communist campaign against Saga Reconyssans teams resulted in the
[00:00:35] green berets exceeding a 100% casualty rate, meaning of the special forces soldiers who went
[00:00:43] across the fence into Lousen Cambodia, all were either killed in action, wounded more than once
[00:00:49] in combat with enemy forces, or they simply disappeared. As of July 4th, 2017, there are 50
[00:00:58] green berets listed as missing an action in Lousen alone from the secret war, along with 105
[00:01:06] aviators who died supporting Saga missions. Saga hatchet force operations of platoon or company-sized
[00:01:15] missions didn't fare much better. In an effort to bring a temporary halt to shipping supplies
[00:01:21] flowing down the Ho Chi-Mintrail, three separate hatchet force slam operations were conducted in
[00:01:28] Lousen west of South Vietnam between March 1969 and February 1970. The area of operations
[00:01:36] was codenamed Prairie Fire. Again, due to the severe political constraints placed on Saga operations,
[00:01:46] the Prairie Fire area of operations extended west of South Vietnam about 30 miles.
[00:01:53] No Saga teams went beyond that area of operations. The three slam operations were titled
[00:02:00] Nightcap, Spin Down, and Halfback. Each of those operations had a hatchet force company helicopter
[00:02:08] to a hilltop on the main segment of the Ho Chi-Mintrail. The trips would dig in, set up ambushes,
[00:02:16] and target NBA trucking. After the lead trucks were hit, there would be a traffic backup
[00:02:23] along the jungle trail. Oftentimes large portions of the Ho Chi-Mintrail were not visible from
[00:02:30] air due to clever camouflage efforts by the NBA and their constricted forced labor of local
[00:02:37] indigenous tribe people. Thus, when the first trucks were hit, hatchet force radio operators
[00:02:44] would call in tactical air support to destroy as many enemy trucks and soldiers as possible.
[00:02:52] Eventually, after a few days, the NBA masked hundreds of soldiers to hammer the hatchet force
[00:02:57] positions, inflicting serious casualties upon the entrenched troops, forcing their extraction
[00:03:03] from the area of operations. During the last mission, Operation Halfback, an aged 34 South Vietnamese
[00:03:12] Air Force helicopter from the 219th Special Operation Squadron was shot down, killing all passengers
[00:03:19] aboard the old warbird, including Special Forces Medic, Sergeant 1st Class Bill Doyle. Those
[00:03:28] operations were viewed as successes due to the amount of enemy trucks, supplies, and troops
[00:03:34] destroyed during the intense battles. The three slam operations were launched from the top secret
[00:03:42] sag base in Con-Tune, command and control central. The last slam operation was run by B company
[00:03:50] in hatchet force command. By the end of August 1970, Greenbrake Captain Jean Maccarli
[00:03:57] became the commander of B company. Maccarli was a sag veteran, having run missions during the last
[00:04:04] few months of 1967 and into 1968 when he was assigned to RT Florida out of Con-Tune in 1968.
[00:04:15] RT Florida ran a series of successful missions, including a trail watch,
[00:04:21] wire taps of NBA phone lines, and planning Air Force sensors alongside a trail.
[00:04:26] At the end of August, Maccarli heard through the grapevine that a major hatchet force operation
[00:04:34] was coming through the chain of command and he volunteered B company for it.
[00:04:40] Assuming it might be another slam operation, Maccarli researched and the after-actions reports
[00:04:46] from the previous missions. He talked to team members in camp about those operations,
[00:04:52] their successes, their shortcomings. In the first days of September 1970,
[00:05:00] the operations order came down and was assigned to B company under the command of Maccarli.
[00:05:08] It was dubbed Operation Tailwind. And much to Maccarli's surprise,
[00:05:15] Operation Tailwind was targeted for the deepest insertion into Laos ever by a sag team.
[00:05:21] 25 to 30 miles beyond the normal area of operations.
[00:05:28] The operation was designed to take pressure off a CIA operation
[00:05:34] further southwest bordering Cambodia. Because the unique nature of this mission,
[00:05:40] Maccarli drew upon his years of operational experience in Laos for a daring new tactic.
[00:05:46] Instead of remaining in a static position like the earlier slam missions,
[00:05:51] once the full element B company, 15 green berets and 120 highly trained
[00:05:57] Montengarde tribesmen were all in the ground in the deepest penetration of enemy territory during
[00:06:02] the Secret War, he would move day and night, supported by air assets from the Air Force Army
[00:06:09] and Marine Corps. It would be an epic mission. In hindsight, 47 years later, although no one
[00:06:19] said so at the time, most agreed it was a suicide mission.
[00:06:30] And that right there is from the prologue of a book called
[00:06:36] Saga Chronicles Volume 1 written by John Stryker Meyer, otherwise known by his Nickname and
[00:06:45] Code name and call sign, tilt and it is once again an honor to have.
[00:06:52] Tilt here with us as he has been here before for podcasts 180, 180, 180, 180, 180, 180, 180,
[00:07:00] 186, 247 and now 248. If you haven't listened to those yet, go listen to them to understand
[00:07:08] what Saga was and what heroes these men were including this man, my hero, John Stryker Meyer,
[00:07:17] tilt, thanks for coming back on. Good evening sir, good evening. Welcome.
[00:07:22] Thanks for coming back. It's my honor. So this is just a story that you and I had talked about
[00:07:30] some of the different stories that we've covered and you know, you've kind of, I guess you
[00:07:35] kind of somehow ended up being a little bit of the the Saga historian, capturing a bunch of these
[00:07:41] stories from different operations even when you weren't there, but interviewing guys, talk
[00:07:47] to them, gathering all this information and then capturing and putting these books. But it has the
[00:07:54] I mean, since you were in Saga and you operated in these areas of operations that these guys
[00:08:00] were in, the way you were able to tell the story is is powerful. Well, thank you. But this book here
[00:08:06] is the first one that doesn't have my stories and that's why I like because that's why
[00:08:12] goal is going to be for saw Chronicles is my little hubble company and we're going to write these
[00:08:17] stories until we die because there's so many that have never been told. And this mission,
[00:08:22] Operation TL when it was a classic, I'd heard little tidbits about it over the years, but
[00:08:29] until and we'll get into details later, how with 98, there's some facts that came out twisted
[00:08:35] on that due to the communist news network. But, factually, this is just an amazing mission.
[00:08:40] And so many levels. And it was a classic example of a saw operation with men on the ground,
[00:08:49] doing the mission, got it accomplished. And they worked with Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps
[00:08:57] Air Assets. I think for fast moves to gunships, and Jean McCarlay was just an outstanding soldier,
[00:09:04] a soldier soldier. And he started out as a listed, became an officer. So he never lost that grounding,
[00:09:12] but just one hell of a commander in here, he just, that was his concept. And they ran with it,
[00:09:18] and we get into this story, just amazing stuff. Yeah, the air superiority that we had was
[00:09:26] really powerful. But you have to remember that it wasn't totally our superiority. It wasn't like,
[00:09:33] look, we have air superiority in Iraq and Afghanistan. We very rarely will lose an aircraft
[00:09:40] then, usually it's because there's some kind of an accident or a crash or something like that.
[00:09:44] But even though it's pretty easy to say, oh, yeah, we had full air superiority in Vietnam.
[00:09:49] We had a certain level of confidence. But at the same time, we didn't have totally our superiority,
[00:09:54] because there was still aircraft getting shot down by either migs or getting shot down by
[00:10:00] surface to air missiles. Yeah, because you had two separate air wars. You had the air war over
[00:10:08] North Vietnam. That's the Air Force in the Navy, just pounded away, losing hundreds of men.
[00:10:13] And it had the whole POW, where there were many where we turned, I forget the exact never.
[00:10:19] And they came back in February of 73 through April 73. They came back. So that is more of a
[00:10:25] traditional yet as maigs that were trained by the Russians, etc. And some even said to Russians flu.
[00:10:31] I don't know. We were more concerned with down south in the Prairie Fire AO in Cambodia.
[00:10:38] Over time, as the war progressed, particularly after Lyndon Johnson had the bombing hall in
[00:10:43] 78, man, the anti aircraft stuff, the 12.7 to 23 millimeter, 37 mic mic and heavier stuff.
[00:10:51] And one of the stories later here is one of our medics. He members flying out and
[00:10:59] will have some cup of that stupid history later. But in a way out to his act act in the air.
[00:11:04] Just like World War II. When you see 12 o'clock high and all of it, you see all the act act
[00:11:11] that shot down all of our airplanes and World War II. There it was, courtesy of the Russians.
[00:11:16] And they were shooting at our hillock hopters. And so the dock page was like,
[00:11:20] oh my god, this is like watching a World War II movie, but it's right here.
[00:11:25] And so that is our world. And this is the World War II movie, except I think I might get killed.
[00:11:31] And in World War II, they didn't have any helicopters that we know about.
[00:11:36] And so that is the aspect where, like in your introduction, we talked about the MIAs
[00:11:41] today, missing an action, the Americans that were shot down supporting sod.
[00:11:46] That's everything from fast movers down to the smallest hillock hopters, the loach. And of course
[00:11:52] you're meeting me here for us like with this story we talked about on Tuesday with the limb black.
[00:11:58] On the visual reconnaissance, it's just a little dinky observation aircraft. The copolysis head blown off
[00:12:04] Lily and his head and helmet lands on the lens lap. So those are the casualties that went into our war.
[00:12:10] That's our side of the air war. So we dominated the air, but that air was full of anti-aircraft weaponry deadly.
[00:12:18] Yeah. Absolutely.
[00:12:22] Well, I guess we should get into this this story because this this tailwind is
[00:12:29] is just kind of crazy. No, they saw another day. It's all right. So here we go.
[00:12:35] Going to the book, Sog Chronicles, Volume 1. And for everyone that's hopeful out there,
[00:12:39] there's going to be Volume 2, 3, 4, 5. The Lord will.
[00:12:45] I know there's more stories than you got time to write. I mean it's good. There's so many stories.
[00:12:50] Every one of these operations is its own book. Oh yeah.
[00:12:55] You know, every time I read one of your books and I read one operation,
[00:13:00] I think there's a whole story, a whole book, a three or four hundred page book about every single
[00:13:06] operation. If you start going into the granular detail in the backstory, it's it's crazy. So
[00:13:14] get to work. To keep writing. Yes, sir. All right. Here we go.
[00:13:21] Routinely under protocols established in an early Sog Secret War. Most laosian
[00:13:27] Sog operators were limited to 20 kilometers west of Vietnam's borders. Operation tailwind was
[00:13:32] book to go approximately 40 kilometers further west beyond that limitation. To go that deep and
[00:13:39] allows required formal approval from the laosian ambassador and from the US Commander of
[00:13:44] all forces in Vietnam, General Creighton at Abrams. McCarty, the B company commanding officer at the
[00:13:51] Top Secret Sog compound in Cone Tomb. Might say that right Cone Tomb? Cone Tomb. Commanding
[00:13:57] Control Central got the word from S3 on September 4th, 1970. And he says, I remember getting
[00:14:05] called by S3 and they told me that we had a special mission. A mission that was deep into laos,
[00:14:09] a mission deeper and allows than ever before. And a mission bigger than any before in the prayer
[00:14:15] refire a.o. Said McCarty. They told me to go heavy on ammo and demo. I knew that such a mission would
[00:14:26] take special clearance up to the ambassador who is no friend of Sog and from Abrams, that's General Abrams,
[00:14:32] who is no big fan of special forces. In short order, he learned that all of the approvals
[00:14:38] had been received and signed off. So this is a massive mission. Bigger than any mission, deeper and
[00:14:43] allows than ever before. And that means you got to get approval from the ambassador. And generally,
[00:14:50] if you don't know this, ambassadors usually aren't fond of military actions inside their, inside their
[00:14:57] arena, that's the right that they want. And that one ambassador just made life so difficult for Sog
[00:15:01] from every day that we're open there. Yeah, I mean, ambassadors, if you think about it, just from a
[00:15:06] philosophical level, you know, they want to solve things through diplomacy. And, and so generally,
[00:15:13] they have a little bit of a of a friction with the military elements, generally, not always.
[00:15:19] And then you have Abrams, who's not a fan of special forces, which I believe we've done a good
[00:15:26] job of moving this in a better direction, but there certainly has been tension from time to time
[00:15:32] between conventional forces and special forces and special operations, guys, generally because
[00:15:38] special operations, guys, well, they don't follow the same rules all the time that the conventional
[00:15:44] guys follow. And they might have a little bit of an attitude and that can rub them the wrong way.
[00:15:49] And a little bit. So, you know, you got a guy like General Abrams, it doesn't like special forces,
[00:15:56] except when he needs them, except when he needs them, well, there you go. And he needed them here. So,
[00:16:03] continuing on later that day, S3 provided more specific details, go heavy, create havoc for the
[00:16:09] NVA and keep them busy as long as possible. Maccarly, a former team leader of Sog Recon team Florida,
[00:16:18] where he ran seven successful missions transferred to the hatchet force where Green
[00:16:23] Braves ran platoon and company sized operations across the fence in Lousen, Cambodia. So, just so
[00:16:30] everyone gets a grip on this, these hatchet forces. Now you have instead of having 12 guys on the ground,
[00:16:36] or six, or six guys on the ground, like you would with one of your recon teams. Now you're talking
[00:16:42] about a group of special forces, guys, maybe 10, 12, 15 special forces, American special forces,
[00:16:49] guys, and then 120 or 150, in-ditch force. So, in this case, there are mountain yards,
[00:17:00] and that means you can conduct these bigger operations. And that's really the
[00:17:05] fundamental mission of special forces. Of the Green Braves is to work with in-ditch forces,
[00:17:10] train up these guerrilla forces so that they can become a strong fighting unit. The Seals
[00:17:15] have a different primary mission. The Seals primary mission was always generally considered to be
[00:17:22] special, direct action and special reconnaissance. Find the enemy, kill. Yep, that's the Seals,
[00:17:28] and the special forces was more, hey, find the enemy and then train some of the local
[00:17:35] populists to go kill them. That's the goal. And it's more of a long-term solution. You know,
[00:17:39] you'll hear the Green Braves say it's teach him how to fish instead of just giving him a fish.
[00:17:42] Seal teams, we just kill the first general. Now, we both cross over. And we both do each one,
[00:17:50] you know, we do their operations when I was in Ramadi, that's what we did. We trained a bunch of
[00:17:55] in-ditch forces, a bunch of Iraqi soldiers. And, you know, of course, there were special forces units
[00:18:00] that were doing all kinds of direct action missions there as well. So, we do cross over. But if you
[00:18:05] look at the kind of bread and butter, this is just bread and butter, Green Brave operation,
[00:18:10] a massive in-ditch force going into to do to harass the enemy. Oh, yeah. This is what it,
[00:18:17] this is what it is. Take the pressure off of the CIA, you know, to a witness, as kicked.
[00:18:21] Explain that background a little bit about what's going on with the CIA there. Well, at that time,
[00:18:26] Premier Sionok had been asked it. And this is 1970, I forget these act a month, but like
[00:18:32] Mayor June, right around there. And so he leaves country. There's a political vacuum. And so the
[00:18:38] communist, one ahead south in mass, because many troops in Cambodia just to take it. Because the
[00:18:45] NVA knew there was a Camille Rouge element that was on a sideline and growing in strength in Cambodia.
[00:18:53] So, the CIA put this operation together, which was further, deeper into the last near-to-border.
[00:19:00] And the NVA came at them hard. Now, they had 5,000 CIA troops in their getting their ass kicked.
[00:19:08] And they said help. So, they came up with this concept, have the team go in,
[00:19:15] and then Gene McCalley put his little unique spin to it. And after talking, because by 1970,
[00:19:22] particularly out of costume, those hatchet forces were good. They really knew how to work with the
[00:19:27] Air Assets and it's which includes Spectre Knight. And so Gene knew all about that stuff.
[00:19:34] And so he put that idea together and it worked in terms of drawing the way NVA from the CIA,
[00:19:42] which in the end, mission accomplished. Not only did they draw them away, the CIA could hold,
[00:19:49] but they also had some major enemy cashiers in the command post. And that's why my favorite
[00:19:54] picture on a front page, there's a picture of our guys from Contune,
[00:19:59] Stanner with a picture of Ho Chi Minh, which was taken from one of the tables in the command center
[00:20:06] there, it was the NVA command center. When I was going through what they call seal,
[00:20:12] was called seal tactical training before that was called seal basic in dock.
[00:20:17] And then it became seal qualification training. It's like, what you do when you get done with the
[00:20:21] basic training, we did a raid on a target. And this is up in Fort Lewis, Washington.
[00:20:28] Then so we do a raid on a target and they're flying a flag on this little compound, right?
[00:20:36] And they're flying this flag and sure enough the the officer in charge of our class,
[00:20:41] which was now the the Platoon commander of our Platoon going to do this hit.
[00:20:45] He sees that flag, walks over to it, undoes the figure eight, starts pulling it down and sure
[00:20:51] enough the instructors have booby trapped that thing in a blow's up. You're a casualty.
[00:20:56] So when I said that picture on the cover, I always think, man, I was always scared to touch anything
[00:21:00] that looked good. Absolutely. Yeah, if the first day of a low school, maybe it's too good.
[00:21:05] Yeah, but you know, those, a lot of guys, a lot of guys from the war and Iraq, a lot of guys
[00:21:15] went home with with paintings of Saddam Hussein because those things were pretty easy to find.
[00:21:20] They were everywhere. Yes indeed. Yeah. All right, going back to the book with the hatchet
[00:21:26] force or the hatch force, we were used to going across the fence and getting our ass kicked and
[00:21:31] then getting saved by tack air. On operation half back and louser earlier in the year, we lost
[00:21:37] two South Vietnamese Air Force H34s, which included SF Medic Bill Boyle who died in one of those
[00:21:43] choppers. We got hit hard because we were dug in and the NVA pounded our position.
[00:21:48] With operation tail would tailwind once on the ground, we were going to keep moving day and night
[00:21:54] to keep the NVA off balance and keep them from massing a large force against our position.
[00:22:01] It's it's fundamental. What we're talking about is maneuver warfare, right?
[00:22:05] Instead of saying hey, we'll do a Trishon warfare. We'll sit on this this mountain top and you attack us.
[00:22:09] Hey, we're going to move around and you know, won't know where we are.
[00:22:13] But that's tricky too. Moving 150 guys around in the J.
[00:22:17] In the jungle indeed. In the J. As they say.
[00:22:23] Although no one said to at the time, at least not outright, the mission that Maccarlie and the CCC
[00:22:27] hatchet force were gearing up for to execute could be called a suicide mission. As Maccarlie
[00:22:33] briefed the B company, platoon leaders, squad leaders, medic Gary Mike Rose and company first
[00:22:39] surgeon Morris Adair in the CCC compound operation orders were going out to critical support
[00:22:47] elements that would play crucial roles in operation tailwind. First, there was a the long distance
[00:22:52] to the target in Louss because it was so far away, neither the older piston driven H34
[00:22:58] secorceky helicopters of the South Vietnamese armies or South Vietnamese Air Force 219 special
[00:23:05] operation squadron nor regular army hewis slicks could be used to insert and extract the 136
[00:23:12] man detachment. So you got just to straight up fuel limitation. Absolutely. These aircraft
[00:23:18] they're not going to be able to fly that deep into Louss. So what does that mean? Back to the book.
[00:23:23] Thus, Sog Brass turned to the Marine Corps aviation wing that flew the largest troop carriers in
[00:23:29] Vietnam. The powerful CH53D secorceky twin-engine helicopters in an HMH 463 based at the
[00:23:40] Cores Marble Mountain Air Facility. Using the bigger stronger heavier lift helicopters made
[00:23:46] sense because three sea stallions with the with the design capacity hold 55 troops could take the
[00:23:52] entire hatchet force of 136 men all their equipment and extra supplies such as explosives and
[00:24:00] an ammunition and insert them into the target area. So there you go. The CH53 helicopter is a massive
[00:24:09] freaking helicopter. Oh yeah. It holds 50 something troops with all their gear and all their rounds
[00:24:16] for their weapons. Yeah, that's a that's an awesome aircraft and those were the only two engines in
[00:24:22] this before they came out of the three-engine model like you used. Oh, see I got that. I got it easy.
[00:24:31] In previous years Marine Corps Aviators from HMH 463 had performed fearlessly and key
[00:24:37] saw operations across the fence and Marine Brass knew that flying combat troops and supplies
[00:24:42] into Louss always resulted in the helicopters getting hit by enemy fire. In the first day said
[00:24:48] Maccarli it was funny. The Marine Brass were a little reluctant to go that deep and allows
[00:24:53] because they knew the sog missions presented extra challenges and dangers to Marine Air crews.
[00:24:59] But once they heard about the unique aspects of operations to Operation Tailwind, they wanted in.
[00:25:06] Marine Sergeant Larry Gro, my saying that right, Gro was a door gunner and structural mechanic,
[00:25:12] structural mechanic in HMH 463 when the operations order came into the command shed and denang. The
[00:25:19] most dangerous and he says the most dangerous and most interesting missions we flew were missions
[00:25:26] 72 and that was sog support. We called it going over the fence. For me personally this is why
[00:25:33] joined the Marine Corps to run special missions against the enemy. I was looking for adventure
[00:25:38] and wanted to be where the action was. The Marine Aviators were told to prepare for a mission
[00:25:43] 72 insertion deep into Louss. Gro replaced the 50 caliber machine gun with the M60 because it
[00:25:51] gave him more maneuverability and if we got shot down he said and quote if we got shot down I could
[00:25:58] carry it and take the flight to the enemy. The 50 was too heavy to carry. Is that a great Marine
[00:26:03] O'Wild? Yeah. So just so everyone understands what we're talking about. A 50 caliber machine gun
[00:26:08] is a big gun and you can't shoot it. You can't you can't carry that thing and shoot it from your
[00:26:16] shoulder from your hip. It's meant to be mounted on a vehicle or mounted a necrath. But in M60
[00:26:22] you can't shoot by yourself. You can carry it and you can fire it from the hip or from the shoulder.
[00:26:28] And so this Marine's thinking well we're going out these freaking saw guys. Probably a pretty decent
[00:26:34] chance we're going to get shot down. I'll go ahead and switch it out that way if we get shot down.
[00:26:38] I'll be able to you know unhook that thing and go and fight.
[00:26:43] You'll allow us to think of Marine boy. He's something. He's one of my all-time heroes
[00:26:47] from this mission. Yeah. Not far away from HMH463 at Marvel Mountain Air Facility Marine Aviators
[00:26:56] from HML 367 Scarface got the op order for Operation Tailwind in a more dramatic fashion according
[00:27:04] to Cobra Gunship pilot Joe Driscoll who is a first lieutenant at the time. And he says
[00:27:13] the duty driver came by our room at two or three o'clock in the morning and told us to pack our
[00:27:18] gear as we'd be gone for five to ten days on an operation to be ready at 5 a.m. My first thought was
[00:27:24] maybe we're finally going into North Vietnam. Driscoll and fellow pilots flew the early model
[00:27:30] H1G Cobra Gunships with one man sitting in front seat and a pilot sitting behind him. A relative
[00:27:37] of the more familiar Huey helicopter the Cobra Gunship had a man more narrow profile design strictly
[00:27:43] as a weapons platform. Driscoll Cobra had two 19 shot 2.75 rocket launchers, two seven shot
[00:27:52] rocket pods, one seven six two mini gun that fired six thousand rounds a minute and a grenade
[00:27:57] launcher that fired 40 millimeter high explosive rounds. That's why they call it a gunship.
[00:28:04] That's firepower. When the early versions of those Cobra's were fully armed and loaded with
[00:28:09] aviation fuel the helicopters skids would drag on the runway for a shirt distance until the
[00:28:14] pilots gained enough lift to get the bird airborne. However, once once in the air, they brought the
[00:28:19] fight to the enemy with precise gun runs and rocket runs. Scarface and several other marine
[00:28:25] helicopter units have been involved in the Secret War and Vietnam for several years,
[00:28:29] usually supporting recon teams and hatchet forces from FOB1 at FOOBI and FOB3 at K-SON or FOB4 at Denang.
[00:28:41] In the northern and you're just this section of the book is laying out and I'm skipping through
[00:28:45] it like I always have to skip through some stuff, get it, get the book so you can get the
[00:28:49] rest of the details. But you know, you mentioned that this was a massive joint operation through
[00:28:54] all these different forces and in this section you're laying out the various air platforms
[00:28:59] that are going to be brought to bear to execute this mission. You go on here in the northern
[00:29:04] side of Denang at the Joint Military Civilian Airfield Air Force Spad Pilots who flew the
[00:29:11] single wing, single wing A1 sky Raiders received their initial operator for Operation Tailwind.
[00:29:18] So the A1 sky Raiders this old school World War II era, right, invented and put together
[00:29:28] at the end of World War II used to help Korean War and then the Air Force Brass put them all away
[00:29:36] and then Jack Singlov and other Commanders said we want those aircraft back in servers
[00:29:41] and they had this big battle behind the scenes that get the sky Raiders because they were just
[00:29:45] phenomenal support for Sog. The nickname Spad World War I. I looked it up. It's an old World War
[00:29:54] one airplane and it's the one such an ancient beast that they called it the Spad, the World War
[00:30:00] One Airplane. Awesome looking bird. Going on here. The single, the single engine war
[00:30:08] plane was loved by American ground pounders. This is kind of like the A10. Oh yeah, you know,
[00:30:12] the A10 is the same thing. People trying to get rid of it and all the ground pounders say we love
[00:30:17] that thing. Absolutely love that world. The only thing the A10 with Missy was Napomp. Yeah, that would have been nice.
[00:30:21] Oh yeah. Chris McCridot. The single engine war plane was loved by American ground pounders and
[00:30:28] feared by communist troops because of the havoc and death they rained down on enemy troops.
[00:30:32] Additionally, through the unique design by Ed Heineman at Douglas Aircraft Company during World
[00:30:39] War II, the Skyrader could stay on station over a target longer than any aircraft and it brought
[00:30:44] bombs, cluster bombs, 2.75 rockets, 20 millimeter cannons and two mini guns to the battlefield.
[00:30:53] Once again, that's a lot of firepower. Plus bombs and Napomp.
[00:31:00] Over the years, several Sog recon and hatchet four screened arrays were called getting
[00:31:04] shawered with set shell casings from the A1 skyraders as they flew danger close to the teams.
[00:31:10] They were supporting. Some later reported receiving burns on the back of their necks from hot
[00:31:14] shell casings that fell from the war bird and landed on the soldier's necks, burning their
[00:31:19] skin once they lodged in the collar. However, no one ever complained about those burns,
[00:31:24] burns that were often life savings, life saving. Lieutenant Colonel Melvin Swanson was the group commander.
[00:31:31] When Operation Tailwind, Op Order landed on his desk. And here's what he had to say.
[00:31:36] To tell the truth, we didn't do anything special when the Op Order came down. I had no idea
[00:31:41] where we were going. We operated like any other Sog mission that we'd supported over the years.
[00:31:46] We had two A1s armed and cocked ready to go for Sog missions and search and rescue missions.
[00:31:52] We provided ourselves on saving Sog teams. Sog missions were our primary assignment
[00:31:58] with Saur as the other priority. When they called, we answered. Always.
[00:32:08] Back at CCC and Con'tume, McCarley, restated the mission to his platoon leaders and squad leaders.
[00:32:16] Go heavy on ammo, grenades, and C4 plastic explosives, and light on food and water.
[00:32:23] And he says, I had every team member including our Indiged Troops Carriot least one pound a C4,
[00:32:31] because we were going to blow up any enemy caches and structures we found, and C4 was always
[00:32:37] good for clearing LZs. Greenberry medic Gary Mike Rose went through his mental checklist,
[00:32:44] preparing to carry enough medical supplies and bandages for a company sized operation.
[00:32:49] He would make sure that each greenberry team member carried at least one more fiends
[00:32:54] threat in a specific pocket. He also made sure that he packed that each packed several
[00:32:59] sizes of bandages and at least one IV. He packed about 15 serets of more fiend,
[00:33:05] five serets of atropine. He always carried five for insert and snake bites even in camp,
[00:33:11] as well as extra bandages, medical tape, rubber tubing, and several NATO surgical kits.
[00:33:17] Rose worked with his mononyard, Cache. Is that right? Cache? Cache? Cache? Who he described has a
[00:33:25] loyal brave soldier and medic who carried a similar amount of medical supplies that I carried.
[00:33:32] And like many young soldiers rose never thought for a minute that he would be wounded during combat.
[00:33:39] Thus the stage was set for launching Operation Tailwind on September 11, 1970,
[00:33:45] after several weather delays and rocket attacks to the launch site north of CCC.
[00:33:52] It would be a mission where the 16 greenberries would receive a total of 33 purple
[00:33:58] hearts for wounds received during the heavy combat that was about to unfold in louss.
[00:34:08] Oh yeah. And the fun thing here is we this is the first time we were able to
[00:34:14] interview all the aviors like Mel Swanson, one character, and then Joe, Driscoll, and his cohorts
[00:34:21] from Scarface and then Met Larry and a couple of other, it's on the pilots over time.
[00:34:29] Yeah and we'll get to it because you mentioned in the book and you talk through that, but a lot of
[00:34:33] times you'd never even see these guys. Never. I mean there are stations in different places. They're
[00:34:36] up in the air, you're on the ground and you never, you never meet them. Never. And look at me,
[00:34:41] you've heard all the stories, my and limb black, defrenchment, Elton Bores, well, we all have
[00:34:47] SkyReader stories that love and say they're bacon, I couldn't tell you one pilot's name.
[00:34:51] Until we had to story. And that was even there at 45 years later.
[00:35:02] So here we go. Let's get to it. After seven days of weather delays, fall starts in enemy rocket attacks
[00:35:07] at the top secret military assistance command base in Vietnam.
[00:35:17] Eugene McCarley, that's the the guy in charge. Eugene McCarley gave the order to move out.
[00:35:23] 15 Bres, 15 Green Bres, and 120 Monn Yards mercenaries.
[00:35:28] On the morning of September 11th, four of the powerful Marine Corps CH 53 D. S. Corsky Twin
[00:35:37] engine helicopters in H.M. H. 463, based at the Marine Corps marble mountain air facility,
[00:35:44] it landed outside the CCC compound and loaded up the 136 man unit. Sog Brass had turned to the
[00:35:51] Marine Corps aviation wing that flew the largest troop carriers to reach into Louss, 25 kilometers
[00:35:57] beyond the normal Sog area of operations. S. Corsky Twin escorted by six Marine Corps
[00:36:03] Cobra's, the helicopters headed north to Refuel at back to before heading into the target area.
[00:36:09] After refueling, they flew north parallel to the border for a while before taking a left turn,
[00:36:15] heading west into the target area. Could the Cobra's make it all the way in? Yes. That's pretty impressive.
[00:36:21] Yeah, they had actually fuel capacity got it. And here's a speaking of the pilots that you got to
[00:36:28] interview. It was a hot zone from the moment we arrived. Scarface Cobra pilot Joe Driscoll said,
[00:36:34] we took several hits on the first gun run. During the insertion of the team Scarface pilot
[00:36:40] Sid Baker and I were surprised by the volume of fire. In fact, we took hits in our rocket pods.
[00:36:46] We had bullet holes in our tail boom and they shot out our radio. When the Cobra's made their final
[00:36:52] gun run, we followed our SOP, which was sustained formation and keeping eye out for enemy soldiers firing
[00:36:58] at us. And quote, because they had no radio contact, Driscoll and Baker simply flew through
[00:37:04] flew through the pattern to cover the ship in front of them without firing.
[00:37:09] quote, the enemy didn't know we had no radios. I'll tell you one thing that was a hot target
[00:37:16] Driscoll said, we were moving targets. The CH53s were static targets, but they went in,
[00:37:22] dropped off the troops and got out of their post-haste. Man. Yeah, on insert.
[00:37:30] I see, ordinarily we're done. We get shot at going in unless you're limb black and his ones
[00:37:35] you're out of it. But ordinarily you're done. You just turn around and go home. We're compromised.
[00:37:42] The idea is to get inserted, do a mission without being compromised. There by our old standards,
[00:37:47] we're compromised. Operation tailwind, we're going in. Come hell or high water. It gets better.
[00:37:54] Oh yeah. Continuing the CH53s were big targets. McCarly said, all of the CH53s were hit by
[00:38:02] enemy ground fire wall and rout to the target. I'd never received so much ground fire while
[00:38:07] flying to a target. He said, it sounded like a BB gun shooting a tin can, but it wasn't BBs that
[00:38:13] the troops heard it was enemy rounds. By the time that B company exited the helicopters
[00:38:18] four-month yards had been wounded from enemy gunfire, one died while flying back to base
[00:38:23] with his three wounded comrades. Greenbrake, medic, sergeant, Michael Rose added. It was strange
[00:38:30] exiting the chopper stepping over wounded in action to get to the ground.
[00:38:36] Yeah. So they haven't even started the mission yet. They got one killed and three wounded. We haven't
[00:38:42] started the mission yet, but we got we got three wounded and one killed. Continuing under ordinary
[00:38:50] sag mission SOPs, any recon team or hatchet force that received enemy ground fire and men wounded
[00:38:56] in action prior to getting to the ground would have canceled the mission. This was no ordinary
[00:39:01] mission. Company being moved off the helicopters and was on the ground in lousy shortly after noon time.
[00:39:09] One fundamental trueism of the Vietnam War as well as the eight years secret surface,
[00:39:15] the communist forces fought when they wanted to fight. Thus when McCarley and the Mani
[00:39:20] remaining 131 members of B company settled into the woodline, they found complete and utter silence.
[00:39:25] He said it was so strange. The aircraft pulled back, we were on the ground and there were no enemy
[00:39:32] soldiers, no noise, no birds, nothing. So once again you get that weird quietness.
[00:39:37] Oh yeah. What do you think make the NBA think we're going to shoot when they're inserting,
[00:39:42] but once they land, we're not going to do anything. What do they think? What's the enemy thinking
[00:39:46] at that point? Who knows? They're tactics always varied and I think a little bit was just a
[00:39:52] complete element of surprise. They thought of birds and so the people shooting at would be
[00:39:56] anti-aircraft crews along the way and probably some ground troops for the AKs. I don't know.
[00:40:01] I wasn't there. But once they land, let's see what the boys are up to. That's what the NBA
[00:40:08] could be thinking just to see what and then they knew with those three helicopters coming in.
[00:40:14] There's a lot of people and they wanted to maybe do their own assessment. See, who they are and
[00:40:21] what they're up to because sometimes the NBA just did react as quickly, particularly that
[00:40:28] far west. They were never actually surprised at a several levels. Surprise that we were there,
[00:40:34] or sod was there and then surprised at the number of aircraft and that they actually got in.
[00:40:42] And so there's all three different elements, but you know they're checking it out.
[00:40:47] Mm-hmm.
[00:40:51] Continuing on, McCarthy, who was serving a second tour of duty in sag, wasted no time. The company
[00:40:55] moved out in the northwest direction and then the men of B company had another surprise.
[00:41:00] Surprise. After moving less than 400 meters from the LZ, the point element of the company
[00:41:05] reported seeing huts. The first platoon deployed two squads to search the area. They found an
[00:41:11] enemy ammo dump 20 bunkers spread out over 500 meters hidden in the under the jungle canopy with
[00:41:18] vegetation and dark covers. After setting up perimeter security, the B company troops pulled together
[00:41:23] a quick inventory of what they had found picked up samples. While demolitions experts,
[00:41:30] as Sergeant First Class Bernard Bright and specialist fifth class Craig Schmidt,
[00:41:35] photographed identified the weapons and ammo and began setting up explosive charges with 13.
[00:41:40] And a half minute delay fuses in the two larger structures with white phosphorus grenades attached
[00:41:46] to each charge to better mark the exact location for Kavi who had then direct air strikes on that
[00:41:51] position. So here we go. Already on the ground, already found bad guy area, but there was no bad
[00:41:58] guys there for whatever reason, but a bunch of ammo and whatnot. They found a cash. So they're going to
[00:42:04] blow it up and then this happens. While the B company team worked on this cash, McCarley had one of
[00:42:12] the most unique moments in its 28 years of military service. As he and a few of the SF soldiers
[00:42:20] were looking at a map, a telephone rang. Quote, I couldn't believe it. A phone rang in the middle
[00:42:27] of the house. McCarley said, quote, so being SF, one of our guys picked up the phone and answered it.
[00:42:34] Hello, fifth special forces group may we help you. Did you imagine the reaction of the communist
[00:42:41] on the other end of that phone to this day just thinking about it makes me laugh? So there you go.
[00:42:45] Yeah. As the SF men chuckled at the phone call, others were compiling an impressive list of
[00:42:52] enemy weapons contained in the bunkers. Massive cash of weapons. Not resting on its laurels,
[00:43:01] B company moved north with a platoon with the first platoon breaking point in a short distance
[00:43:06] to first platoon found a trail. Crossed it were proceeding north. When a dare and second platoon
[00:43:11] squad leader Mike Hagen observed several NVA soldiers on the trail and opened fire on them.
[00:43:17] An NVA 762 round went through Hagen's gas mask, which he had on his leg and slammed into his
[00:43:24] legs so they're carrying gas mask on this operation. Bernie Bright was slightly wounded.
[00:43:29] The round actually parted his hair said McCarley, you can't get much closer than that.
[00:43:34] The NVA fled the area and B company continued to head north after medic Gary Mike Rose
[00:43:40] patched up Hagen's wound. As they marched they heard two large explosions back at the NVA
[00:43:45] bunkers. White phosphorus grenades, that bright and smith attached to the demo charges emitted
[00:43:51] large plumes of white smoke, smoke that covey readily picked up and proceeded to direct precise
[00:43:56] follow-up air strikes. Secondary explosions would continue for more than five hours.
[00:44:03] Can you imagine that? Secondary explosions? Crazy.
[00:44:09] Yeah, crazy amount of, well I mean this is their supply, this is how they're fighting the war.
[00:44:13] Right there you go home and say look what we just did. They'd be a great mission.
[00:44:18] That's the first but hour on the ground.
[00:44:23] B company then made contact with the NVA company, which lasted for close to an hour McCarley said.
[00:44:30] The hatchet force men use close air strikes from Scarface Cobras and spads skillful squad
[00:44:36] tacked and skillful squad tactics against the surprise the NVA to drive them off.
[00:44:41] As Darkness approached McCarley and the point element began looking for location to remain
[00:44:46] overnight for the night. We stopped for a combo check when they fired one B-40 rocket into our
[00:44:53] command post. Rose added we were fortunate we were fortunate in one small way. The rocket flew past
[00:45:02] all of us before striking a bamboo thicket, thus when the shrapnel exploded, those of us injured
[00:45:08] didn't get the full head on blunt force of the metal shards as the Ford momentum of the rocket
[00:45:14] exploded into the bamboo. 45 years later after that rocket explosion rose had one lasting
[00:45:21] mental image of it. He says quote it's funny I can't remember much about it except that all the
[00:45:27] sudden I was flying through the air. At some point while airborne I looked up and saw a blue sky.
[00:45:32] It was beautiful and then I landed. And here's McCarley rose showed us what he was made of that day.
[00:45:42] He immediately started to go to work on the wounded because everyone in the CP at that time had
[00:45:46] varying degrees of wounds. In fact Rose had a serious foot injury. Somehow the shrapnel had
[00:45:51] sliced open his jungle boot and cut into his foot. What did he do? He pulled out an ace
[00:45:55] bandage wrapped it around his foot and used his car 15 as a crutch and began treating our wounded.
[00:45:59] And the quote the most serious wounded was a south-viewed and amoees lieutenant. Shrapnel sliced
[00:46:07] into his right thigh to the bone in addition to other shrapnel wounds. We stopped and
[00:46:12] looked our wounds as Rose passed patched up our people McCarley said. McCarley's plan was to continue
[00:46:17] to move at night and if B company made contact with the enemy the special forces men would determine
[00:46:22] whether to attack them or maneuver around them or simply pull back and call and fix wing gun
[00:46:26] ships that could bring deadly fire from the sky upon the enemy troops on the ground.
[00:46:32] Fast forward a little bit. Finally, Rose rigged two stretchers from rubber poncho supported by thick
[00:46:37] bamboo poles and tied them down with six foot sections of rope. They would now be able to carry
[00:46:43] the most seriously wounded indigenous troops when Rose gave McCarley the okay. B company took the
[00:46:49] bold step of moving out at night. Quote, I wasn't going to let them tie us down in one position
[00:46:54] and then hammer us by us moving. They didn't know exactly where we were. There were little
[00:46:59] scirmishes and a few times we ran into a few NVA after contact we'd move on. If there was a larger
[00:47:05] element we could pull back and call in the gunship strike. We had flare ships over us every night.
[00:47:12] End quote, B company continued to march west deeper into laughs. The deeper B company green
[00:47:19] beret and their mountain yards headed west the more they enhanced their primary goal of being a
[00:47:24] diversion to the NVA forces attacking the CIA's operation catapult. This wasn't going to be easy.
[00:47:32] By dawn, nine of the Americans, nine of the 16 Americans had been wounded. So these guys have
[00:47:39] been on the ground for what is it? They got inserted around noon. So we're talking of very short
[00:47:49] period of 18 hours. Yeah, 18 hours or something like that and they already have nine of the 16
[00:47:56] Americans wounded. Rose and his indigenous medic, Cach, worked tirelessly on the wounded all
[00:48:04] might even as they moved throughout the dark jungle. So they got nine wounded just Americans
[00:48:09] and they're still moving. And the two seriously wounded, Montenegro. Yeah, in stretchers.
[00:48:14] And stretchers and provides. Yeah, man. Carrying stretchers is no joke. You need to have like a
[00:48:23] team to care if you think if you think, oh, just get two guys one on each side of the stretcher.
[00:48:27] That works for a little while. But you end up having to either rotate those guys out or you put
[00:48:32] four guys on the stretcher so much harder than it looks. Now luckily the yards are smaller though,
[00:48:37] right? Yeah. They're not like the big of them. Man, when we when we were going through training
[00:48:42] and I was be a downman. The guys would be like, hey, bro. I love you, but could you go on a dive please?
[00:48:50] Take this grenade. It will see you later. Good luck. We'll mark you with a cam light.
[00:49:00] Continuing on, Captain G. McCarty had the men of
[00:49:04] B company hatchet force moving north well before the sun rose on day two of Operation Tailwind.
[00:49:10] We zigzagged a lot during that mission because we didn't want the NVA to get a good fix on our
[00:49:14] position as we knew they tried to pin us down and attack us in force if that happened.
[00:49:19] Said McCarty. Within an hour NVA soldiers hit the first platoon with automatic weapons,
[00:49:24] B-40 rockets and mortars. Two squads maneuvered against the enemy while McCarty
[00:49:29] directed air strikes against the enemy positions that tactics work because of thick
[00:49:33] jungle they weren't able to get an accurate body count as McCarty continued to march north. However,
[00:49:40] SF, medic, Gary Mike Rose knew the casualties were climbing among both SF and in-did's troops
[00:49:47] of B company. We had two yards killed and yards of the short name for Montenegro. We had two yards
[00:49:55] killed when Captain McCarty and I got hit with Shrapnel from the B-40. After conforming,
[00:49:59] confirming they were dead, I wrapped them up and we carried them with us as best we could, Rose said.
[00:50:05] However, after trying to carry them while tending to the two most seriously injured men,
[00:50:10] I quote, I had to make a decision to leave the two dead men behind because I could see that
[00:50:15] carrying them as we moved, we were causing too much fatigue for the living.
[00:50:20] So we made a decision that has bothered me for nearly half a century. By day two it seemed as though
[00:50:26] every day every hour I kept getting more and more wounded. So the SF medic rose, he's looking at
[00:50:33] the situation and we were just joking about how hard it is to carry guys and clearly he was dealing
[00:50:39] with that. It's incredibly hard and you think like I said, it takes, you have to have guys to
[00:50:47] rotate through it's taking out a whole lot of your combat power when you're moving wounded. So
[00:50:53] they probably have probably takes 10 guys to move these two wounded guys maybe even more.
[00:50:59] So that's 10 guys out of the fight and you're moving slower and so he has to make this
[00:51:03] agonizing decision that we're going to leave these guys.
[00:51:09] When I talked to Mike for that part of the story, his eyes well done. It was just like yesterday.
[00:51:16] It really still hurt him. Now 50 years later. Yeah. Rough.
[00:51:27] Continue's on here at one point during an attack on B company and VA force of more than 40
[00:51:31] enemy soldiers. Two of the most seriously wounded men that rose was treating had both of their
[00:51:36] IV fluid bags shattered and destroyed during a hail of enemy gunfire.
[00:51:40] I learned to lesson right then and there said rose. We kept the IVs flowing from low positions
[00:51:48] allowing gravity to work but not high enough for the enemy gunfire to destroy them.
[00:51:52] Were you guys using IV bag? Were your IV's glass? That's a good question. I forget.
[00:51:58] Okay. That's for the medics of the Kamagai. Yeah. Well the weird that well we all carry
[00:52:03] IVs and we ended up getting small IVs but I don't know if he said the IVs shattered. So that makes
[00:52:11] me think maybe they were made of glass. What the bag? IV bags. Yeah. Just like your big jars.
[00:52:17] Yeah. Oh no there for our medics they had plastic. Okay. So maybe because they're I'll
[00:52:24] not show it to Hatchiforce. He took what he had. Yep. That'd be my assumption. So you're treating
[00:52:34] your wounded. You're giving them IV and the freaking bags or the jar gets shot at. Yeah.
[00:52:40] Continuing on as the Hatchiforce moved north it was obvious to Macarly that rose had his hands
[00:52:45] full as he continually as he had to continually monitor two most seriously wounded men.
[00:52:49] Men who were being carried by him and other team members and structures made of bamboo sticks
[00:52:53] and ponchos because they were so many wounded Macarly directed B company to find or make an
[00:52:58] LZ for a medivac to land and take out the wounded. They found a large bomb crater and began
[00:53:05] preparing the LZ when the enemy initiated two successive contacts with them. Sfiring small
[00:53:10] arms before the rockets and throwing chycom grenades as they worked to on establishing a clearing
[00:53:16] B company dealt with the two separate attacks from the NVA using squad tactics and attack air.
[00:53:22] Both the attacks were neutralized only to have Covey report that the weather had turned bad
[00:53:26] prohibiting any rescue attempts for the day. Without hesitation B company moved moved out again
[00:53:33] going west for a while then north keeping its pattern of movement unpredictable.
[00:53:39] What I remember most about day two of Operation Tailwind was the disappointment of having the
[00:53:44] weather turned bad preventing a much needed medivac. Macarly said, so these guys have the goal
[00:53:51] like okay we got we got some wounded guys we need to get these guys out of here they fight
[00:53:55] to get it get an LZ once they get this LZ established under attack they push the attack back
[00:54:02] and then the weather rolls in and the guys can't guys can't fly. How these days your weather
[00:54:08] is there what's your what's your confidence on the weather predictions?
[00:54:16] Like the weather predictions and Iraq are pretty easy it's going to be hot.
[00:54:19] Every once in a while you would get a storm and we had some sandstorms.
[00:54:26] Oh I saw them. The sandstorms they're they're like biblical sandstorms. Oh yeah they blacken the
[00:54:32] sky it's pretty cool to see but you can't run off send them at all like you can't make communications
[00:54:39] because the sand blocks radio waves. So basically if there's that kind of biblical sandstorm coming
[00:54:47] everyone just kind of stands down now you can go out and try and get into a good position
[00:54:52] but you can't see anything you can see you know maybe maybe 20 yards or something like that
[00:54:59] I mean you visibility just gone. Oh yeah but we could kind of know that they were coming.
[00:55:04] I never got let me put this way I never got surprised by the weather in Iraq. It was
[00:55:11] there was sunny and hot 99% of the time. Every once in a while there'd be some kind of cloud
[00:55:18] maybe a little bit of precipitation by because we were by the fridies with river where it was
[00:55:23] it was human people who know that by the fridies rivers freaking human and I'm going to show
[00:55:29] you pictures sometime of this area to the to the north east of the city of Vermont it was still
[00:55:36] in our in our AO and it was called the MC one or the one MC but what we called it was
[00:55:45] Viet Ram because because it looked like Viet No. Yeah. They looked exactly like Viet No.
[00:55:51] Palm trees, rice patties, dikes. My steps on told me about it.
[00:55:56] This is in the green zone. Yep. Yep. It's like I thought it was back in Viet No.
[00:56:00] With you. Always seeing the green zone in Afghanistan? No. Oh, in Iraq. And by green zone he
[00:56:06] means areas where there was the we was called the green zone was the biggest most secure area in
[00:56:12] Iraq. Okay. So you're talking about the green zone in Baghdad. And Baghdad. Okay. Yeah. And he was
[00:56:16] operating southeast and different locations for near some of which they came into Iraq. He juggle.
[00:56:22] Yep. In Afghanistan they call the green zone. Yeah. Like areas where there's areas where
[00:56:27] they're like heavily folk. There's a lot of foliage. Right. Okay. So in Iraq the green zone is
[00:56:33] the green zone. It's the thing right there in Baghdad, which is big and secure. It's where they
[00:56:37] had good food and all that stuff. Yeah. We never had any sandstorms in the jungle. So maybe
[00:56:43] a Thai food or two. So my question was when you would get a weather prediction, you're going to go
[00:56:47] like these guys, let's say you were going on a four-day mission. And they're telling you,
[00:56:53] all right, looks like the weather is good. How good did you feel about that? Like did you give it
[00:56:57] 50 or 50? Yeah. You've figured what that was. It's figured because it could change so quickly.
[00:57:03] But the positive thing is that if it gets cloudy, how long is that? How long are you thinking that
[00:57:07] last four? Oh, you know, every time was different. Um, could the clouds a lot of time to be clouds
[00:57:15] in the morning? Sometimes they burn all sometimes they wouldn't. And there's just so much moisture around.
[00:57:21] And we're always jogging with the weather. I'm just one of the factors that just no control.
[00:57:31] We get predictions. But we got sucked in a couple times. And again, they wanted to get us into a
[00:57:39] hole. So okay, we just go up and try to get into a target and get in and then mother nature closes
[00:57:45] the hole. So like, it was just that the lie love and waited out. Wait it out because if you move
[00:57:53] and make make contact, there's no support. And the NVA know that. That's what really really
[00:57:58] come at you. Hard to do is no air. So they love it when there's bad weather. Oh, sure.
[00:58:05] Oh, yes. The air weather was the NVA's ally.
[00:58:09] All right. Fighting them and VA fighting the weather. Mother nature. It's a night mother nature.
[00:58:18] It's another day at Sog. Back to the book. Night two and Louss was similar to night one.
[00:58:23] B company kept on the move with continued support from moon beam, linking the team with shadow,
[00:58:27] stinger, and specter gunships throughout the night. During that night, we heard track vehicles.
[00:58:34] We heard trucks Macarley said. Night two sounded like a lot of trucks heading south, bringing troops
[00:58:39] and supplies south, and some to deal with us. We had skirmishes that night and we directed air assets
[00:58:45] to assist us directly and to the areas where we heard motor vehicle activity. So now you got the
[00:58:53] specter gunships, common at night, which is a beautiful thing. What I had all three variations
[00:58:59] because you know, when I first get there in 68, spooky was the first one. And then they came out with
[00:59:07] shadow, which was a C119, where a spooky was the old C47, and they could have maybe two
[00:59:15] ring guns. And when they came out with the shadow, could we have one of our recon teams said,
[00:59:23] they came back, they lived through the night, and they went through a couple of shadows,
[00:59:26] and they had more orders, make it stay on station longer, and then another team, a couple
[00:59:32] months later, or maybe you're off to get the time frame, then it was a stingers. Again,
[00:59:36] C119s, with the weapons, the computers, the lock-in on the strobe light, and then specter.
[00:59:45] And 50 years later, it's still dominate the night. Yeah, that thing is a beautiful piece of machinery.
[00:59:49] The NVA also inflicted some more casualties in the company. By the time McCarley moved out at
[01:00:02] 4am for day three, September 13th, 1970, Rose was tending to more than 30 wounded men.
[01:00:11] Two with deadly serious wounds that required almost constant attention, fluid rejuvenation,
[01:00:15] and pain management. By that time Rose was also running low on bandages, ivies, and morphine
[01:00:20] serets.
[01:00:22] Quote, we were so low on morphine that I reused morphine serets, which is a no-no-under normal
[01:00:28] circumstances, but there was nothing normal about this operation, so I would give two or three
[01:00:33] of the wounded morphine from the same seret. I only gave them enough to dull the pain,
[01:00:38] but allowed them to be somewhat alert.
[01:00:40] And Quote. As Rose focused on the wounded, the first platoon engaged the enemy as they moved
[01:00:47] toward a potential LZ for a much needed meta-vac, while the third platoon deployed one squad to
[01:00:53] maintain contact with another squad of NVA attacking the company's rear. After several gun runs
[01:00:58] by Scarface and A1 skyrators from denying in Thailand, the rear action force rejoined the company
[01:01:05] as it pushed into a good LZ site and began clearing trees with clay more mines and C4 plastic
[01:01:12] explosives.
[01:01:16] At noon after Scarface and the spads performed gun runs on enemy positions near a small LZ,
[01:01:22] the first Marine Corps 53D approached the LZ. As the large helicopter descended into the LZ,
[01:01:28] the pilot Bill Beardall was concerned that the LZ might not be large enough to land in.
[01:01:33] As he maneuvered the chopper slowly downward, Rose moved toward the rear tailgate of the CH53
[01:01:40] with his most seriously injured soldier, the South Vietnamese lieutenant with the horrific
[01:01:44] thigh and hip injury. Inside the chopper SF-Medics John, staff sergeant John Dock-Padget
[01:01:51] and sergeant John Brown moved onto the back tailgate as it lowered with Brown supporting
[01:01:57] Paget by holding his belt. I was trying to reach the patient that Mike was lifting towards us
[01:02:03] and just at that moment in time the pilot pulled pitch and lifted to the left.
[01:02:09] And quote, Rose said quote, the tail rotor struck a tree as I was lifting the patient up towards Dock.
[01:02:16] The chopper lifted upward suddenly. As it was lifting up, it took enemy small arms fire and a
[01:02:23] B-40 rocket hit. And quote, Paget said quote, when that B-40 hit us, it went through the fuel cell
[01:02:34] but didn't explode. There was aviation fuel everywhere. How it didn't ignite, I'll never know,
[01:02:41] but surely God was riding with us. And quote, bear doll pilot of the CH53 radioed Mayday,
[01:02:50] Mayday, we're going in as the CH53 began losing fuel in its hydraulic fuel,
[01:02:56] few fluids. Why H14, that's the number of this particular CH53,
[01:03:02] crashed without any injuries to the Medix or crew members who immediately
[01:03:05] exited the wounded bird and set up a defensive perimeter with Paget overseeing the impromptu
[01:03:11] team on the ground. As the NCOIC for SOGCC dispensary at Kahn Tum,
[01:03:19] Paget could have pulled rank and stayed behind. And he said quote, but that wasn't how I did
[01:03:26] things. I usually took my turn riding on the Chase medic ship. So here you have a guy that's a
[01:03:33] senior guy that could have been sitting back in the in the in the Hooch air condition in the air
[01:03:40] condition, who's pooch back on base, but he's he's not that kind of leader. No, not at all steps
[01:03:45] up and gets in there. And now these guys are getting shot down. Maybe he's questioning
[01:03:50] that decision right now. Oh, I'm sure he was. He made that set up for the record. But
[01:03:55] talks a smart guy. Figure all the angles. As they set up their perimeter scar face lieutenant,
[01:04:03] H E Newton called CH53 aircraft number Y H 20 piloted by Mark McKenzie met them at a rally point
[01:04:12] and led them to the crash site where Scarface and Spads made gun runs in preparation for the
[01:04:18] Chase medic aircraft called Sard by them by the Marines to arrive for the down, downed crew and
[01:04:24] SF medics. While En route to rescue the crew of Y H 14 said Y H door gunner Larry Grow, I was
[01:04:35] admiring the beautiful countryside. And I couldn't help thinking of all the bad guys down there waiting
[01:04:40] for us. My M60 was lockloaded and ready for action. As we got closer to the pick up site, I could see
[01:04:46] that it was surrounded by smoke that was laid down by Scarface Cobras along with their rockets
[01:04:51] and 40 millimeters to protect the crew of the downtropper and quote. As Y H 20 was about to
[01:04:57] settle into a hover over the downed crew, an NVA 51 caliber anti aircraft heavy machine gun
[01:05:03] opened fire on the aircraft's left side. Grows left side window was only about 25 yards away from
[01:05:11] it. And the muzzle flashes from the gun were huge and the round seemed to be the size of basketballs.
[01:05:17] Grow pulled the trigger on his M60 and held it until the 51 cow was silenced.
[01:05:23] The CH53 started to bounce around and I knew quote and I knew we had taken some hits.
[01:05:29] Sergeant Whitmer was working his gun on the right side as Captain Kipola and Sergeant Spalding
[01:05:35] were at the rear ramp throwing out the 120 foot aluminum extraction ladder and quote. Meanwhile,
[01:05:42] Scarface Cobras were making gun runs, spads following suit hitting enemy sites.
[01:05:48] Quote everything seemed to slow down as the action heated up Grows said.
[01:05:52] Everything was in slow motion. When the ladder landed on the ground,
[01:05:56] Paget told everyone to climb in, climb it and hook onto it. There was so much confusion and noise
[01:06:04] that no one moved to the ladder. He said, finally I said follow me and up I went. They followed suit.
[01:06:12] This is just me, him. Grows said the lift off from the LZ wasn't easy. Quote, we had no idea
[01:06:20] just how bad the battle damage was but we were bouncing all over the sky and we had a huge beat.
[01:06:26] Meaning that there was something terribly wrong with our main rotor blades and quote.
[01:06:32] Now the crew of YH20 was concerned about the safety of the aircraft and the men below
[01:06:37] riding on the extraction ladder. So you have the helicopter get shot down and then this other
[01:06:43] helicopter comes into rescue. They get lit up with a with a dish gun machine gun 12.7mm 51 cow,
[01:06:50] which is a freaking massive machine gun. They get shot up with that. They throw the extraction ladder
[01:06:57] out the back. A bunch of the guys don't know what to do. Finally someone on the ground starts
[01:07:03] climbing the ladder. They all start climbing the ladder but they don't get up the ladder. So they're all
[01:07:06] just hanging onto this ladder and then this thing starts to try and get out of there and it's like a
[01:07:13] car with a piston that's not firing. Exactly. Quote, in hindsight there was really no way that
[01:07:28] we or anyone else could know how bad the damage was said grow. Quote, only when we finally made it
[01:07:36] back do we just learned how bad our damage was. Numerous rounds it cut the hydraulic lines to the
[01:07:42] tail rotor, one round from the 50-count it almost cut the main rotor tail drive shaft in half.
[01:07:50] That round it hit next to the Thomas coupling which connects the tail rotor drive shaft sections
[01:07:56] together. We were extremely lucky to have made it back to base. God was with us that day.
[01:08:03] Paget said. Man those helicopters are beasts to take that kind of damage. Oh yeah.
[01:08:10] Yeah. Salute. Salute the 53's. Amen. For the rest of the men on the ground during the night of
[01:08:21] day three there was no rest. By the way while all that's happened we still got 100 something
[01:08:28] guys left on the ground. The NVN testified it's attacks against the men of B company throwing an
[01:08:34] estimated 600 plus hand grenades into the defense positions of the hatchet force even as it moved
[01:08:41] a few times during the night. So now we're taking 600 hand grenades.
[01:08:48] By now the B company met it gained an important tactical advantage over the NVA. I like this. This is a
[01:08:53] good attitude to have right here. When we got a freaking down helicopter we got all these wounded
[01:08:58] guys. We received 600 grenades and here you know what? Here we go. By now the B company men have gained
[01:09:06] an important tactical advantage over the NVA. They learned the NVA combat signals during the close
[01:09:12] in fighting. The NVA would hit two bamboo sticks together or use a whistle for signals. The hatchet
[01:09:19] force men learned that one click or one whistle signal the NVA to move. Two meant throw hand
[01:09:28] grenades and three meant withdraw. hatchet force men would then radio what signal what the signal was
[01:09:36] to the other team members so they could adjust accordingly. More than once when the NVA signal
[01:09:41] to withdraw the hatchet force men would then attack when they were more vulnerable. It was one more
[01:09:46] tactical advantage that they used to their advantage against an enemy force that continued to grow
[01:09:51] on the battlefield despite losing hundreds of men to air strikes, bombing runs and team ground fire.
[01:09:59] Meanwhile back in denying at their air base the Marines returned to repair their aircrafts
[01:10:05] as the warning order came down for day four. The weather and NVA hordes were closing in on B company.
[01:10:13] Woof! With those hand grenades one of the things that the limb black discovered was that the
[01:10:24] NVA had hand grenade vest where they would have four or five hand grenades in one vest that you
[01:10:31] get it and throw it forward and hold it and then all five grenades will launch at one time with the
[01:10:39] pins pulled so you have four or five hand grenades coming at you one time. They were all like
[01:10:46] tied together or something? Yeah. So when they got the vest and then threw it but held it the hand
[01:10:54] grenades a task would then go forward. Oh god it. And so would this thing that was going on with the
[01:11:00] 600 plus I'm sure that was one of the tactics the NVA were pulled because they had the hand grenade
[01:11:07] vest. That's a lot of grenades to respond. That's a lot of grenades to respond.
[01:11:19] That's a lot of grenades. You need to fully have go off because they're Chinese and Jai Kong.
[01:11:22] You still have only half go off. That's still 300 grenades. Yeah. And that also tells me something
[01:11:28] melts. It tells you how close the enemy was. Yeah. Because that means they're throwing those grenades.
[01:11:33] So this is close fighting. And not to mention you are not going to have close it's so close that
[01:11:41] we can hear their signaling when they're bang and tube bamboo sticks together. Primitive but effective.
[01:11:47] Primitive but effective but also so close that we can hear it and we hear it so much that we actually
[01:11:52] decipher their freaking code. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Going back to the
[01:11:59] look the morning of Operation Tailwind day for Dawn to Palm Beach Company hatched force of Mac
[01:12:03] Vsog moving toward an LZ to lift out the more seriously wounded among the remaining 127 men
[01:12:09] who could still walk. All 16 green berets had been wounded at least once and about 40
[01:12:16] mont yard troops were wounded during the first three days of this secret for a deep in the
[01:12:22] louse. So there you go. That's at least 40 probably more. Could nobody nobody count everybody's just too busy fighting.
[01:12:32] Be Company commanding Officer Captain G Maccarly had the point element moving toward an apparent
[01:12:37] clearing with one fought mind. Get one Marine Corps heavy lift. CH53 helicopter into pick up the wounded
[01:12:45] and then continue to march to destroy any NVA fortification supplies or troops they encountered.
[01:12:53] By now the entire second platoon was being used to help care for and transport the wounded
[01:12:58] under the tireless leadership of medic Gary Mike Rose including three wounded who were carried
[01:13:05] on impromptu stretchers. So there you go. You have an entire platoon of what 40 guys. Yeah. You have
[01:13:12] an entire platoon of 40 guys that are just being used to for the wounded help the wounded.
[01:13:18] So that's how hard it is to deal with wounded and move wounded. And his Marine has more
[01:13:24] feamed. Surreets are low. Fast forward a little bit. The men on the ground didn't know about
[01:13:33] two startling developments. The weather was closing in with a storm front that would prevent
[01:13:40] attacker from supporting B company and operation tailwind had rocked the NVA brass into rallying
[01:13:46] hordes of north Vietnamese and path it loud troops that were moving toward the highway 165 area
[01:13:55] near the tiny hamlet of Chavane. So these guys don't know it but there's massive enemy coming
[01:14:03] and bad weather. Now when this bad weather hits just to be clear if I didn't make this clear enough,
[01:14:10] the only thing that really keeps you guys alive on the ground at a certain point is just the
[01:14:15] fact that we have air superiority and you can drop bombs because they got hundreds if not thousands
[01:14:21] of troops going against you. So if you lose air support it's a matter of time because if
[01:14:29] look the NVA they don't care they'll keep coming they'll come in waves until they finally just
[01:14:35] overwhelm you with just a tritian. So if you lose tack air at some point you're going to be
[01:14:42] overrun and everyone's dead. Our edge is gone. Yeah. Yeah Dave. Here's McCarley quote when we
[01:14:52] started day four we hadn't thought about an extraction except for getting the wounded out.
[01:14:56] We took our mission seriously meaning he's saying look we're not even thinking about leaving yet.
[01:15:00] Not at all. We're staying out getting our wounded out but we're ready to go. We're going to stay.
[01:15:06] We took our mission seriously. Relieve the pressure on the CIA's operation.
[01:15:11] Thanks to tack air we had hurt the enemy no question and by continuously moving we had kept the
[01:15:16] NVA off balance. We were tired but our morale was good. We'd been on the move about an hour when we
[01:15:22] heard dogs. These weren't dogs that sounded like tracker dogs the NVA used on us. They sounded like pet dogs.
[01:15:30] So we moved toward their sound and the first platoon followed them. The dogs led B company to what
[01:15:36] would become one of the greatest military intelligence coup of the eight-year
[01:15:42] sog secret war in louss. They're not tracking dogs but they're just like pet dogs and the guys
[01:15:52] follow them back to this camp. That's me I'm going the other way. Dogs anywhere particularly in the
[01:15:59] A. Oh. Sorry. Yeah no the first time I think it was the first time you were on and we were
[01:16:06] talking about those tracking dogs about halfway through the conversation after you're talking
[01:16:09] about these dogs they're smelling you and they're closing on you and I was like tell do you still
[01:16:15] like do you not like dogs and you said I hate dogs. Yeah totally understood.
[01:16:26] Before long the enemy troops filed fire several B 40 rockets at the point element of B
[01:16:32] company and then fell back and look like they had gone back to some sort of bunker complex
[01:16:37] McCarley said after a brief skirmish and a brilliantly executed spad gun runs
[01:16:43] where they'd used cluster bomb units on enemy positions. The first platoon led the assault
[01:16:48] on those bunkers with a well coordinated attack while second platoon covered our flank
[01:16:52] and provided rear security. So so you guys these guys run up against an enemy position with bunkers
[01:16:59] and what do they do attack it? Yeah call in for closer support and attack it on day four. I mean
[01:17:05] these guys probably have eaten their short on water their wounded.
[01:17:11] Third platoon protected our right flank we caught them napping. We hit the outpost when they were
[01:17:16] cooking breakfast. There were open fires fires with cooking pots on them. Hell they never had
[01:17:22] anyone mess with them before this deep into louss. A few NVA hit in a couple the bunkers
[01:17:30] whom the montn yards quickly eliminated with hand grenades. Those bunkers were nothing but
[01:17:34] gory blood and guts after the grenade attacks McCarley said. Again a one-scirator,
[01:17:39] sky-raders delivered. CBU's precisely along two key enemy lines,
[01:17:43] instantly silencing enemy gunfire hand grenades and rocket attacks.
[01:17:49] Within a short period of time more than 70 NVA were killed as B company swept through the base.
[01:17:56] As B company drove the remaining NVA out of the outpost they discovered a bunker in the base of camp
[01:18:02] that quote appeared to be like a basement in a regular house. Said McCarley. It was at least 10 feet
[01:18:09] long and 10 feet wide with maps on the walls and a foot locker loaded with documents. I emptied my
[01:18:15] rock sack of everything except for extra car 15 ammo. By that time I'd use the extra battery,
[01:18:21] radio battery and C4 that I was carrying and I started packing with enemy documents papers,
[01:18:25] code books, transportation logs, and quote within 15 minutes the base camp was overrun. The
[01:18:33] area was searched for intelligence and photographs were taken as medic microes continued to
[01:18:38] treat the wounded men of the company. So this is a score. It's a coup and a half. Oh yeah, rich.
[01:18:48] By now it was clear to B company intelligence men that they had stumbled into an NVA
[01:18:53] battalion base camp that was a major logistical command center and probably the headquarters
[01:18:57] that controlled the nearby lay ocean highway 165. Remaining true to his original operation order,
[01:19:05] McCarley had all the intelligence documents packed and ordered B company and all of its walking
[01:19:10] wounded to march out of the battalion base camp while demolitions experts wired 120 millimeter
[01:19:15] mortar for enemy trucks and more than nine tons of rice for destruction. As usual after
[01:19:21] the special forces charges exploded A1 skyrators followed up with gunnapom and bombing runs
[01:19:27] to completely destroy all enemy structures and supplies. Boom. Nine tons of rice.
[01:19:38] Feet a lot of people. Oh yeah. Meanwhile back at con tomb fast forward a little bit.
[01:19:45] Meanwhile back at con tomb while all that's happening. All the air assets the A1 skyrators of
[01:19:51] the denang based operating location alpha alpha scar face pilots and CH53 pilots
[01:20:00] or getting a detailed briefing on the weather and a sighting by cubby of hundreds if not more
[01:20:08] than a thousand NVA and path that loud troops moving east towards B company.
[01:20:13] Quote during that final briefing it was very clear today it was due or die.
[01:20:21] End quote from scar face pilot Joe Driscoll quote the big thing was the stark seriousness of the moment.
[01:20:29] Everyone knew they had suffered heavy casualties and now the weather was closing in on them.
[01:20:35] A1 skyrator pilot tom stomp added quote the weather was dog shit when we took off. I wasn't
[01:20:42] optimistic about getting them out of their end quote on the ground and louse McCarley pressed
[01:20:47] forward until he received a disturbing radio call from Covey sometime in the early afternoon of
[01:20:52] September 14th day for of operation tailwind quote I believe it was Covey writer Jimmy Wardaddy Hart
[01:21:01] radio down and told us the NVA were massing and if that and that if we didn't get out of there today
[01:21:07] we weren't going to get out period that got my attention. Frankly he mentioned the weather issue
[01:21:15] too which up to that point in time I wasn't aware of because we were in the jungle end quote.
[01:21:23] Yeah that got your attention huh. Oh yeah and everybody back at base they know they're getting hammered
[01:21:30] and it was bad and they're getting ready to go they don't know how bad it is. It's like you're in a
[01:21:36] jungle like you've heard it before you don't know what the hell bad the weather is of your on the ground
[01:21:41] and you can't tell about times the difference between sun and the no sun that's just dark in the
[01:21:47] jungle and they break loose every once the while I get to open if they could see right
[01:21:53] Jean had no idea that's when Covey told because I interviewed Jean on and he was like
[01:21:59] stunned when they when the Covey told like he really thought we're going to kick Darius we just hit the
[01:22:05] cash you say cash or cash you're the English major I'm only English minor so I had a it's cash
[01:22:11] cash oh thank you sir it's cash I'll be more correct now I got corrected that I got corrected
[01:22:16] but on that when I was I think I was like an E five or something E four and you know I was
[01:22:23] briefing something and I said well there's a cash A over there my officers said actually
[01:22:28] charcoal it's cash and I said no it's not I didn't believe him you had to go to the dictionary
[01:22:35] and back then you actually had to get a dictionary yeah yeah well I'll tell you what you're the man
[01:22:40] if you want to call it cash A we can change it right now we we will follow suit I always preferred cash A
[01:22:47] me two things cool sound could be cash a status but cash A's got a little more
[01:22:52] more of a possess yeah so these guys are in a bad way and and now McCarley kind of
[01:23:01] realizes we got the enemy coming we got weather moving in back to the book realizing they
[01:23:07] needed a large LZ a large LZ large enough to handle a CH 53 because CH 53's are massive birds
[01:23:16] in the light of and and by the way there's no opportunity you're not going to get 50 guys out on strings
[01:23:22] so this thing's going to have to land yeah and you got wounded on top of that in light of losing
[01:23:28] one of the 53's heavy lift helicopters on a tight LZ the previous day yeah by the way we
[01:23:33] already lost one of these things McCarley moved down a road towards a clearing that was large enough
[01:23:37] for Nell Z however the open area was seated too deeply in a valley which had hills on two sides of
[01:23:43] it where the NVA gunners would be able to have clear fields of fire on the marine rescue helicopters
[01:23:48] as well as the supporting tack air assets Scarface cobre gunships to facilitate the continued
[01:23:55] movement of B company A1 spads and cobre Scarface Scarface cobre's quote gave us fire
[01:24:02] protection to the front and to the rear McCarley said the NVA kept hitting us with automatic fire
[01:24:08] and B40s the air strikes kept them back far enough so they couldn't do any real damage
[01:24:12] at some point Kaviran dangerously low on fuel returned to base and connected spad pilot
[01:24:20] Tom Stump directly with McCarley about future air strikes shortly before the first CH 53 arrived
[01:24:26] in the area of operations. I'll never forget it when I spoke to Gene that's McCarley when I spoke
[01:24:33] to Gene his voice was as calm as a man at Sunday church picnic Stump said he had that slow
[01:24:40] southern draw and calmly said he was getting his ass kicked down there and all the while I could
[01:24:48] hear gun file gunfire explosions and hand grenades he said he needed some separation between the
[01:24:56] company and the NVA we were on station for two hours doing just that providing close air support
[01:25:02] with all the SF wounded in the large number of casualties they had I couldn't see how we'd get them out.
[01:25:12] Tom Stump McCarley and his men were grateful for the close air support of Stump his fellow
[01:25:21] spad pilot Scarface and tack air but Stump stood out in his mind McCarley said quote Tom Stump's
[01:25:27] flu so close to us during some of those gun runs I could tell if he had shaved or not.
[01:25:33] That's just how close those A1 sky Raiders flew in support of us. We were extremely grateful
[01:25:38] for all the air support believed me but seeing Stump was something that stuck with me. I also
[01:25:44] think that safe to say that because this was a song mission deep into louse none of the
[01:25:48] air assets got that credit they should have received for the remarkable coverage they provided
[01:25:53] to us over four days from the fast movers right down to Scarface and the Cubbies.
[01:26:04] Continuing on B company found a heavily traveled dirt road only wide enough for foot traffic
[01:26:10] and headed to a second LZ one that provided better cover and less exposure to enemy ground fire
[01:26:16] for the helicopters and for the men of B company as they moved cubby rider Jimmy Ward Daddy
[01:26:21] Hart told McCarley he had spotted another quote horde of NVA and quote moving toward B company.
[01:26:29] This time Hart told B company to put on their gas masks and directed A1 sorties
[01:26:35] flown by hobo 20 and fire 544 based in Thailand to deliver CBU 30 tear gas ordinance.
[01:26:43] On the next horde of NVA while B company found it secured a second LZ for the Marine CH53 to land
[01:26:50] this drastic tactic worked it slowed down another NVA horde but many of the men and B company
[01:26:56] including McCarley rose and others were hit by the gas which had a lot of our guys crying and
[01:27:02] choking on that C.S. McCarley said but it also bought them some time so they called and some
[01:27:10] custom bomb units with some coughing gas in it. It's an irritant indeed right which is a
[01:27:19] lot different this is where this is where it's a little tricky and it comes up later but
[01:27:24] that is a chemical right people say well this is a chemical weapon and it is technically a
[01:27:30] chemical weapon but it's a freaking non lethal chemical weapon doesn't kill you. Right just your cry a lot
[01:27:35] if you can continue on the Scarface Cobras led the CH53 season to the LZ with deadly gunruns
[01:27:46] as an Air Force F4 Phantom Jets pounded two enemy mortar pits that were marching 82 millimeter
[01:27:53] rounds toward the LZ that was large enough for only one CH53 to land at a time.
[01:27:59] Quote we escorted the CH53s into LZ the first run wasn't as bad as the previous day
[01:28:05] when I could see dozens of enemy soldiers out in the open firing at us with and the choppers said
[01:28:11] Scarface pilot Joe Driscoll when Macarley lost radio contact with Covey Scarface commanding off
[01:28:17] Sir Lieutenant Colonel Harry Sexton and his co pilot Pat Owen quickly picked up coordinating
[01:28:23] the air assets with Macarley. The first heavy lift let helicopter landed on the LZ picking up
[01:28:30] a majority of the wounded B company men including the three most seriously wounded who were carried
[01:28:35] in stretchers since being wounded on night one of the operation. Since Platoon 2nd Platoon placed
[01:28:43] the wounded on the first Marine helicopter before it lifted off successfully and headed back to
[01:28:48] Conthune. Scarface again led the 2nd Marine Corps CH53 into the LZ this time taking an increased
[01:28:56] volume of enemy gunfire as aviators pointed out to Macarley another large contingent of NVA
[01:29:03] moving toward the LZ now what appeared that the NVA brass realized that B company had hit the
[01:29:09] 559th transportation base camp and taken all of its maps, reports records and money and had
[01:29:16] directed masses of enemy troops towards B company. They told me they could see hundreds of
[01:29:26] them's coming of for us. The 2nd Marine Corps CH53 picked up the remaining wounded men and several
[01:29:35] other members of B company and lifted off the LZ successfully drawing more enemy fire than the first
[01:29:40] heavy lift helicopter. Scarface then led the 3rd CH53 so we got two helicopters of command we've
[01:29:47] gotten most the wounded on the first one the bunch of guys leave on the 2nd one that's all successful
[01:29:53] and now we go Scarface led the 3rd CH53 into the LZ taking even more enemy fire than the
[01:29:59] 2 previous choppers had encountered. However from Macarley rose first sergeant Morris Adair
[01:30:06] and the remaining men of B company the drama wasn't over. CH53 ceased down in pilot
[01:30:13] Don first lieutenant Don Persegi and his coal pilot first lieutenant Bill Baddie or Bady. We're
[01:30:23] concerned about the amount of rounds hitting the heavy lift chopper. I like the way they explained that.
[01:30:28] Yeah, I'm a little concerned. I'm concerned about this.
[01:30:32] The quote on our final approach we took heavy enemy fire Persegi said we knew that this was the
[01:30:37] last element on the ground that we had to get them out. Sergeant first sergeant or SF sergeant Mike
[01:30:45] Hagen said quote I can tell you that big bird was a welcome sight to us. We were all beat.
[01:30:50] We were all wounded and we were all ready to go home. Believe me and quote be company commander
[01:30:57] Captain Jean Macarley Hagen, Medic Sergeant Rose and first sergeant Morris Adair held a
[01:31:04] tight defensive perimeter with a few mont yards as others beat a hasty but orderly path into the
[01:31:10] large marine war bird as dozens of NVA soldiers surged out of the CS gas clouds towards the LZ.
[01:31:16] Macarley was on the radio with Covey. He said you have to get out of there now. This is so this is
[01:31:22] a Macarley saying that Covey said you have to get out of there now. There's hundreds and
[01:31:28] hundreds of them coming after you now. Now that's what Macarley is getting told you have to
[01:31:38] get out of there now. And I don't know how many are left on the ground but it's probably
[01:31:42] what 15 or 20 or something like that. Yeah, because they had the worst wounded. Yeah.
[01:31:48] In the second bird they got a lot of you did you out. As Macarley spoke into the PRC 25
[01:31:55] handset, a mont near a team member standing between Macarley and the radio operator was killed
[01:32:00] by enemy gunfire as he fired his weapon at them. He got shot in the heads. Macarley said there was
[01:32:07] blood all over the place. Another yard looked at him turned to me with a sad look and simply said
[01:32:13] he's dead. A1 Skyrader pilot Tom Stump vividly remembers those long moments before the man of
[01:32:23] B company boarded CH53. It was a wild scene down there as we provided close cover to the team on
[01:32:32] the ground. Air Force F4 is attacked anti aircraft guns that the NVA had moved into the area.
[01:32:41] They, meaning the NVA, had really, had really wanted them. They were mass to get them. They wanted
[01:32:49] to get back what the team had taken from the base camp. Kavie riders told us that NVA, 12.7
[01:32:56] millimeter and 37 millimeter anti aircraft weapons were opening up on us. Meanwhile, the Scarface
[01:33:03] Cobra gunships reacted to enemy gunfire on their aircraft while Jean directed us to enemy
[01:33:09] troops moving toward them. Keep in mind, we knew all the SF men were wounded and low on ammo.
[01:33:15] There was a moment in time when I couldn't see how we'd get them out. It was that intense.
[01:33:26] Coming out of the gas, she used. Not everyone was low on ammo.
[01:33:34] As he was severely wounded in the foot, hand an arm on day one, rose at tightly wrapped
[01:33:39] their torn jungle boot and bleeding foot with an ace bandage to keep it shut and it used his
[01:33:45] car 15 more as a cane to support his weight than as a weapon because he was so busy treating and
[01:33:50] tending to more than 60 wounded men. His left hand had suffered a shrapnel wound also,
[01:33:56] which he quickly wrapped before returning to caring for the wounded team. Now, as he
[01:34:01] a dare and haggard and a hat, haggard moved up the ramp. The semi-mobile medic opened fire on the
[01:34:09] rapidly approaching NVA after they placed their dead-mont Neward soldier on the helicopter.
[01:34:17] McCarley was the last man to leave the LZ. Quote, as we were backing up the ramp,
[01:34:23] they were coming toward us. They were coming at us hard. He said, I'm guessing the CS gas had
[01:34:28] them confused because they were getting close to us as me, Mike, and Morris stood, but none of
[01:34:36] them through a grenade into the chopper. I never understood why they didn't. They were that close
[01:34:42] and they kept coming even as we lifted off from the LZ while mowing down NVA soldiers.
[01:34:49] So, they go through all that and it looks like we're going to be in a pretty good spot,
[01:34:57] possibly. But it ain't over till it's over. Indeed. As the CH53 lifted off from the LZ,
[01:35:07] pilot Persegi said, he and co-pilot, batty. What do you think that's batty or batty?
[01:35:12] Batty. Batty. Could feel enemy rounds continuing to hit the aircraft. A dare, McCarley and Rose had just
[01:35:20] sat down next to Sergeant First Class, Bernie Bright, when someone tapped Rose on the shoulder
[01:35:25] and pointed to the left door, gunner, Marine Sergeant Stevens, who was bleeding profusely from
[01:35:30] a gunshot wound at the neck. Rose said, quote, he got hit in the neck. There was blood everywhere.
[01:35:37] I was coated in blood by then from him and other wounded. He was very lucky. The round
[01:35:42] administered the corroded artery and trachea yet he was going into shock. I rolled him over,
[01:35:49] got him on all fours and remember telling him, listen, you lucky son of a bitch. If you're going
[01:35:54] to die, you'd be dead by now. After that, he started to bounce back. Sometimes as a medic,
[01:36:00] you have sometimes as a medic. You have to be harsh with people to break them out of shock.
[01:36:04] Then I found something to wrap around his neck to get the bleeding to stop.
[01:36:07] As Rose struggled with Stevens bleeding neck injury, knee to realize that the Marine
[01:36:14] door gunner's helmet, helmets open microphone was alive. Explain this a little bit when you're
[01:36:20] on an aircraft. The people in the aircraft have what they call interior communications,
[01:36:26] which is basically a, you know, if you're the pilot, you can talk to the copilot and then
[01:36:31] you can both talk to the aircraft. Everyone's got these little helmets on with microphones.
[01:36:35] And it crews in the back and they can't see each other. So they have to have verbal contact.
[01:36:39] And if you, I know it looks like in a movie, everyone's talking in an aircraft, in a helicopter.
[01:36:43] You can't hear anything in a helicopter. You have to scream directly into someone's ear to hear someone
[01:36:49] especially in a CH53. Those things are freaking loud.
[01:36:53] And so the air crew has these headsets with these microphones that are built a special way so that
[01:36:58] they don't pick up the external numbers. They just pick up the voice. Well, when you key that handset,
[01:37:06] your transmitting, your, your filling up that interior communications network with whatever noise
[01:37:12] you're putting into it. And so I'll go back to the book here. Communications were almost impossible
[01:37:18] as he was on a hot mic. A hot mic is when you're keying up your microphone when you shouldn't be.
[01:37:22] And all I could hear was gasping and gurgling said, Purski was having a potentially deadly loss of
[01:37:28] power issue with the severely damaged CH53 C-Stalian. As the heavily laden helicopter lifted off
[01:37:36] from the LZ and went from a hover mode into transitional lift where the helicopter begins to
[01:37:40] gain both altitude and speed. Engine failure emergency lights and warning systems screamed alerts of
[01:37:46] a pending engine failure within seconds one engine died. Purski had only one remaining engine to continue
[01:37:54] lifting away from the hordes of NVA gathering or on and around the LZ shooting at the C-Stalian.
[01:38:01] And at least one entire craft weapon that was firing at the struggling Sikorski. In addition,
[01:38:07] he and Badi had another challenge on their horizon. How do avoid the mountains that they were approaching
[01:38:13] with only one engine? That ridge line was sheer granite Purski said. By now, in the back of the
[01:38:21] chopper, rose it pulled off Steven's helmet, giving Purski and Badi improved communications
[01:38:25] between them and other air assets as the granite mountain loomed larger by the second quote,
[01:38:31] we were worried as we had to use extra energy from the last engine to get over that ridge line.
[01:38:37] Purski said, after narrowly getting over it, a second granite lid ridge line came in to view.
[01:38:43] It, it too, had to be flown over. Now the big war board war bird was struggling.
[01:38:51] quote, there were hydraulic fluids and blood everywhere inside the helicopter rose said.
[01:38:57] And the tail was lower than it should be. We could tell something was wrong. Really wrong.
[01:39:03] We just didn't know how wrong. Can you imagine? No. No. No. It's it's total mayhem and then you
[01:39:18] have these pilots that are getting shot at their aircrafts filled up with a bunch of wounded
[01:39:24] guys. They're taking rounds. They can feel the rounds hitting and they still have to fly this thing.
[01:39:30] And now they've got to fly it under conditions that they've never flown under before, which is
[01:39:34] having one engine and damaged controls and not being able to communicate with each other.
[01:39:39] This is just mayhem. Back to the book, seconds after barely getting over the second ridge line,
[01:39:49] the second CH53D turbo shaft engine failed. At that moment, quote, I can remember,
[01:39:59] first lieutenant Pertsky's exact words to this day said Maccarlie. He said,
[01:40:03] mayday, mayday, we've lost all hydraulics. We're going down. I looked out of the back and all
[01:40:11] I saw were the granite cliffs. They loomed large to this day. I don't know how we missed them.
[01:40:18] And quote, rose echoed the same sentiment.
[01:40:22] quote, all I saw were those huge granite cliffs with no engines. I fully expected to crash and
[01:40:32] burn at any moment. And quote, Pertsky haulered into the radio one more time. We've lost our second
[01:40:39] engine. We're going down. The fate of the 23,628 pound 88 foot long helicopter designed to carry
[01:40:48] 38 combat troops, but now loaded with 40 plus combat troops and weapons, including all the intelligence
[01:40:53] papers, maps, foot lockers and North Vietnamese currencies from the NVA's base camp hinged on Pertsky's
[01:41:00] piloting skills and the six 72 foot long rotors that were keeping the 15 foot wide helicopter
[01:41:07] loft biting into the air, descending at a rapid rate, but at a rate better than dropping from the
[01:41:13] sky like a dead coil. After he got out a second Mayday alert, Pertsky said he was hoping a pilot
[01:41:21] or cavi pilot would say something. After a second engine went out, there was nowhere to go. All we
[01:41:28] could see was jungle and granite ridge lines. Quote, I really expected someone, cavi, scar face,
[01:41:35] the spads or army cobras to say, hey, go left, go right something, but the radio was dead silent.
[01:41:41] For Pertsky and Badi, the silence was deafening. Now descending in full auto rotation with both
[01:41:53] engines dead, Pertsky began following jungle covered canyons. I followed one gap, he said,
[01:42:00] then I followed a second gap, it led to a ravine. My biggest concern at that moment was being
[01:42:05] able to find a place just to auto rotate into. Marine Corps Dorgon Erlary Grow, who was in the first
[01:42:13] CH53 that pulled out many of the wounded men from B company earlier, said, quote, at that time,
[01:42:20] no one had ever done a full auto rotation with a fully loaded CH53 with no power. Swanson watched
[01:42:31] the large warbird descend into a canyon. Quote, it was like a depression he headed towards.
[01:42:38] It was trailing smoke. It was ugly, real ugly. I worried that it might explode in midair, or worst
[01:42:44] get hit by one of our wars hit one of those granite mountains or the jungle. From my seat up in the
[01:42:50] old trusty skyrator, I couldn't see any L.C. or any area that was open or large enough for those
[01:42:57] Marines to land that bird without crashing. By now I had heard that they were auto rotating with a
[01:43:04] chopper full of troops. It didn't look good. So auto rotating. Yeah. So basically, when a helicopter,
[01:43:18] if a helicopter loses power, you know, if an airplane loses power, you can glide.
[01:43:23] Somewhat, you're not going to gain altitude. I mean, I guess you could technically, if you get an
[01:43:30] updraft or current or whatever, but you're generally going to come down. When a helicopter loses
[01:43:35] all of its power, what the pilot has to do is let the blades, the rotor blades of the helicopter
[01:43:43] keep spinning as fast as they can while you're falling. And then basically, when you get close
[01:43:49] to the ground, you slam those things into the position. It tells those roders to they grab as much
[01:43:56] air as possible in the moment before you hit the ground and you hope that it absorbs enough
[01:44:00] energy that you don't all die. Echo, you look puzzled. Does that make sense?
[01:44:05] Not really. I think there's a lot about it helicopter. I don't know about it.
[01:44:10] Yeah. Because it seems like a helicopter loses power, the propellers just stop.
[01:44:15] But there's momentum. So just pick your sprinting. Just like a spinning stop.
[01:44:20] Keeps the blades going. All right. Like a, are you descending in the air, hit them,
[01:44:25] and keep some of the head or angles that make them spin? I'm not like a rate with the engine.
[01:44:30] So it slows down, but it's better than like he said, just fall down the sky.
[01:44:34] Right. Like those, you know, remember those windmills he's to buy when you're kid and you
[01:44:38] you see them saying, the wind. Okay. If you went into a runway, no wind and you just spun that
[01:44:43] thing. Yeah. It would spin a little bit. But yeah, as you move it, it can spin. Yes. So that's
[01:44:49] God. That's the most thing spinning. And then you laid it along. Yeah. And you know that the blades
[01:44:55] can tilt. You control the tilt of the blades. You can make them kind of flat or you can make them
[01:45:01] like at a bigger angle. So they're grabbing more air. So what you do is you kind of make them flat.
[01:45:05] So they're not getting much resistance, but they're spinning. I, and this is just like I'm,
[01:45:09] I know, I know, I know. I know, I know, I know. I know the juggle. This is how I simplify stuff.
[01:45:14] And with the rocks up in my head. And then when you get close to the ground, you slam that thing.
[01:45:20] So it grabs a bunch of air right before you hit and it slows you down a little bit.
[01:45:25] God. That's the plan. Yes. And in history, no one had ever done this before with a scene with
[01:45:33] the CH53. Okay, filled with troops because as you can imagine, you're adding thousands of
[01:45:39] pounds to it with all these troops in there. So no one's ever done this before. So we'll just say that
[01:45:46] the odds were stacked against this point. It ain't looking good. Okay. God.
[01:45:53] Continuing on, and then divine intervention, Persky and Badi saw a body of water
[01:46:00] with a little patch of beach. It was just blind luck. We didn't know what was there. Or we didn't
[01:46:07] know what was there. Or God was with us. Persky said with the blood hydraulic fluid and aviation
[01:46:13] fuel leaking and pooling in the passenger compartment, Persky headed in that direction. At first,
[01:46:18] he thought about landing in the water to buffer some of the impact of the landing. Then I remembered
[01:46:22] Persky said, we had wounded in the back. I didn't want to take the chance of anyone drowning.
[01:46:27] So we headed the wounded chopper toward what appeared to be a sandy beach next to the water,
[01:46:32] even though it was slanted to the right. All this happened in a matter of seconds. We were going
[01:46:38] down at about 6,000 feet a minute. At that point, we needed a high air speed to use the energy to
[01:46:46] keep the roaders going. So the auto rotation factor would keep the aircraft moving forward and
[01:46:51] said a dropping from the sky. The plan was to flare a procedure where the roaders angle, pitch
[01:46:56] change to slow down the rated descent and minimize the severity of impact upon landing on Terra
[01:47:04] firma. So I was right. The rocks worked. The rocks worked. Dave Berks got nothing on me.
[01:47:15] I started to flare. Thank you. We had enough time to decrease our speed. More. I pulled the
[01:47:19] collective hard. I had it pulled up to my armpit and quote, in a helicopter, the collective lever
[01:47:25] is on the left side of the pilot's seat. And it changed the pitch angle on the helicopter's
[01:47:29] main roaders. In this case, Persky was decreasing the sea stallion speed, hoping to minimize the
[01:47:34] final impact of landing in full-order rotation. Persky added, it didn't slow our air speed as
[01:47:41] much as I had hoped it would. It was supposed to cushion us. It didn't. What's more that beach
[01:47:46] had a huge boulder on it that slanted to the right. The helicopter violently landed on the angled
[01:47:56] slope, hitting the slope surface and instantly slamming to the right into the ground, ejecting
[01:48:01] several of the green berets and their montn yard tribesmen, team members, while six rotors
[01:48:08] shattered upon impact with the ground. Be Company Commanding Officer Captain Jean McCarley
[01:48:14] was violently slammed into the roof of the helicopter before being ejected from it. I remember
[01:48:19] hitting the roof of the helicopter. I remember hitting so hard. I felt my teeth crumbling to sand.
[01:48:28] The next thing I knew I was outside on a rock. We were all dazed, amazed we were still alive.
[01:48:34] Rose said quote, when you pan-cake in like we did on a helicopter and when it hits violently
[01:48:40] upside down, everybody had their bell rung. Trust me we were all hurting. Jean was bleeding from
[01:48:44] the mouth, but he could move. I remember getting thrown out of the blit, throwing out and the blades
[01:48:50] were upside down. I was bleary-eyed, still not getting all my senses back and for a moment I
[01:48:56] thought the chopper was coming toward me. And quote, McCarley said quote,
[01:49:03] Mike was standing beside us. I was wiping the blood and my crush teeth from my mouth. Then
[01:49:08] Mike said, we've got people in there. We have to get them out. I could smell the aviation fuel.
[01:49:15] There was blood everywhere. There was hydraulic fluids. The helicopter was broken by the severity
[01:49:20] of the crash and it was smoking. How it didn't explode. I'll never know how that young Marine
[01:49:25] pilot landed. I'll be at a hard landing. I'll never know." End quote.
[01:49:30] Then McCarley had one of those unique inexplicable moments in wartime. In the middle of
[01:49:39] all the rubble, the smoke, the dazed confusion at the crash site. He looked to his right and
[01:49:44] observed first sergeant Morris Adair standing in the water with a smile on his face holding his
[01:49:51] car 15. That scene was unreal beyond description McCarley said of all the times that I've been
[01:50:02] in loudside never seen a scene like this. A body of water, a nice white sandy beach. It looked
[01:50:06] just like a white. And there's Adair standing in the water as though there wasn't a care in the world.
[01:50:14] Adair says to this day, I can't explain exactly what happened that day. I came out on my own
[01:50:19] but I've been trying to figure out how ever since. When I came to my senses I was standing in
[01:50:23] water. Gene told me later I was standing there smiling. Can't tell you why I was smiling. Maybe
[01:50:27] I was just happy to still be alive after getting my bell wrong. We were bad at around like
[01:50:32] BBC that chopper went at crash. At the time, I didn't realize how much damage it had been
[01:50:36] done to my nerves on my less side of my body, my head, neck, shoulder, arms, and hip.
[01:50:42] The brief reverie ended when Rose and McCarley headed back into the smoking helicopter.
[01:50:54] Because it ain't over yet because they got guys in there. And it's
[01:50:58] f***gap. Fewer leaking everywhere. Burning. But what do they do? They go help. Rose helped to carry out
[01:51:06] SF Lieutenant Pete Landon who had only been in country one week when Operation Tailwind launched.
[01:51:15] Welcome to Sog. McCarley said, Landon, the bulltoon leader had a bad gash on his head that Rose
[01:51:24] had to tend to as there was a lot of blood flowing from the headwoon. McCarley gathered the
[01:51:28] intelligence materials, B company had collected. That was the first thing I did.
[01:51:33] Recovery to the intel documents maps currency that we had seized from the NVA base camp. No way
[01:51:38] we were going back to cartoon without them. After setting up a hasty perimeter at the rear of
[01:51:45] the broken Sikorski helicopter, McCarley returned to help. Sergeant first class Bernie Bright
[01:51:51] get untangled from the wires and debris inside the aircraft. Then they exited the helicopter
[01:51:57] to strengthen the perimeter around the back side of it. In the pilot's compartment,
[01:52:01] Perseke unstrapped Batty who had pulled a bad back compression stemming from the crash.
[01:52:07] I kind of pulled Bill from the helicopter. He was mobile but still stunned. When Perseke
[01:52:12] had set Batty down on the ground in front of the helicopter, he didn't see any SF man on that
[01:52:17] side of the bird. My infantry tactics kicked in. We circled the wagon, set up a rough perimeter.
[01:52:24] He said Perseke said, In the back of the helicopter, Rose McCarley and Mike Hagen
[01:52:32] helped the stun troops exit the helicopter. Before I led any of the injured get off the helicopter,
[01:52:38] I drape their weapons or any weapon near them around their neck so that when they set up
[01:52:43] in the perimeter, they'd be able to defend themselves, said Rose. By this point in time,
[01:52:47] we were strictly working on adrenaline. He added. So even those guys, he's got to
[01:52:55] bend them through all this freaking mayhem and they still go back and rescue their guys and then
[01:53:00] they're still thinking tactically about how to get through this. Yeah Mike Rose is on top of his
[01:53:07] game for a whole thing. Just amazing. Continuing on once again, time was working against the
[01:53:16] men on the ground. I forget how long it took from the time we crashed until I received radio
[01:53:22] contact from either Lieutenant Colonel Sexton or Kovey said McCarley. They told him that the
[01:53:28] backup helicopters fuel levels were getting low and that when he came into the LZ, we'd only
[01:53:34] have five minutes or less to get the hell out. Oh, we might not have enough aviation fuel to make it back.
[01:53:40] After dodging Russian assisted NVA attack aircraft weapons, including Russian manufactured
[01:53:50] attack weapons that exploded in midair and the fashion of anti aircraft weapons in World War
[01:53:54] 2 and hundreds of enemy ground forces firing automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades at
[01:54:00] them pilots in the first car face, cobras that led the rescue helicopter toward the LZ were
[01:54:06] surprised to receive no enemy ground fire. The heavy lift, marine sea stallion followed closely
[01:54:13] behind the Scarface gunships due to the heavy enemy ground fire throughout operation tailwind
[01:54:19] to provide extra defensive fire power for the big helicopter captain H. Kipola.
[01:54:26] Yeah. Kipola. Captain H. Kipola was on the rear ramp with an M60 machine gun in addition to
[01:54:34] right door gunner, sergeant T. McBride on the left door gunner, sergeant T. Winnicky
[01:54:42] and crew chief sergeant Smith. Even though we had our bell wrong, when that chase ship
[01:54:51] backup helicopter landed, we didn't waste any time getting aboard it said Mike Rose. I remember
[01:54:57] H. G. G. and G. and first sergeant helping me helping people up the ramp. Marine pilot
[01:55:03] Perseke knew that he had bitten through his lip upon the crash impact, but he didn't realize
[01:55:07] how severely damaged it was until he moved up the ramp of the CH53 and one of the door gunners
[01:55:13] pointed out that his lower lip was merely hanging on by a thin piece of skin.
[01:55:19] Quote, he told me that I better hold onto my lip or I'd lose it. I do remember they changed
[01:55:23] my call sign afterwards to lip. As the sea stallion lifted off with the wounded and extremely
[01:55:31] fatigued man of V company Rose made another surprising discovery, maggots had helped to treat
[01:55:38] the two most seriously wounded team members who had been carried since day since the command post
[01:55:44] would struck by an RPG round during day one. When that RPG hit, Rose had suffered serious wounds
[01:55:51] in two places, McCarley in several places, and two engaged team members had been seriously
[01:55:56] incapacitated. The one thing I never thought about or planned for said Rose was for the use of
[01:56:02] maggots, which in the end proved to be the most likely life saver for the two most critically wounded
[01:56:09] team members. During those four days on the ground, Rose and the Montyarde medic trainee
[01:56:15] caught were kept busy caring for them, giving them extra fluid, more fun shots and IVs, but
[01:56:21] during those days, quote, flies laid their eggs in the wounds of the most seriously injured and a
[01:56:27] few other yards and the eggs hatched. According to the doctors at the evacuation hospital,
[01:56:36] the maggots got to the necrotic flesh before infection could set in and in fact did a better
[01:56:43] job of deep writing the wounds that a surgeon could do, who would have thought of it.
[01:56:46] We covered a book where that happened with the prisoner war camps in in the World War II.
[01:56:58] The medics would actually utilize maggots. They would get them to plant. They're maggots
[01:57:06] there, get the flies to plant their seeds there. So to eat away the dying skin. Crazy. Oh yeah.
[01:57:18] The CH53 returned to Dactu to refuel while the A1 pilot swans and then stomp to
[01:57:24] strode the crashed CH53. The rescue sea stallion then returned to be company to the LZ
[01:57:30] outside the top secret Saga compound in contomb. An S2 officer approached McCarley and took his
[01:57:37] Ruxack which contained the enemy currency and some of the intelligence documents collected from
[01:57:42] the NVA command post and louss. I never saw that Ruxack can nor the NVA currency again McCarley
[01:57:49] lamented. He continued regardless. The mission was dubbed a success by the folks in Saga on
[01:57:56] and at Saga headquarters. We were told that thanks to R efforts, the CIA's operation was able to
[01:58:01] regain control of the strong point. A top plateau 10 days after we were extracted on the final helicopter.
[01:58:08] We had tied down an estimated regiment of NVA and path that louss forces while destroying one major
[01:58:15] enemy ammo dump and an enemy base camp after we removed the enemy documents and maps. A subsequent
[01:58:21] DOD report confirmed McCarley's final analysis that Operation Tailwind was saws deepest penetration
[01:58:28] into louss during the eight-year secret war. The final count, three-month yards were killed in action.
[01:58:37] 33 were listed as wounded in action. A total of 33 purple hearts were awarded to the 16 green
[01:58:44] berets who served in Operation Tailwind for wounds they were served during the four
[01:58:49] day mission. McCarley required nine months of dental repair and surgery due to crashing crushing
[01:58:58] his teeth when the CH-53 crashed. Two days after the green berets returned to CCC completed their
[01:59:07] reports and got patched up by special forces medics on base. A huge party was held in
[01:59:12] con tomb base with food soda and alcohol for all the participants in Operation Tailwind,
[01:59:17] including the aviators from the HMH-5463 unit Scarface Cobra Gunship Cruise Army Cobra Gunship
[01:59:26] Cruise and some Air Force Covey pilots. Somehow the word did not get delivered to the A1
[01:59:32] Spad pilots and ground crews from the Denang base. 47 years later swans and muesd quote,
[01:59:40] it's just as good that we didn't get the word because we were busy supporting other
[01:59:44] sog and sore missions. You know just another day in the Prairie Fire Area of Operations for our
[01:59:51] sky Raiders. End quote, to this day Rose can't touch the thumb on his left hand with his little
[01:59:58] finger due to the serious nerve and muscle damage he received when wounded on day one. On day one.
[02:00:07] So all that medical treatment he provided with no thumb in action. For more than two years
[02:00:14] his wife pulled PUSCO to trap no and bamboo shards from his body stemming from the many times
[02:00:20] he was hit with shrapnel while on the ground. A dare still stuffers from nerve damage to his
[02:00:27] neck left shoulder and arm from Operation Tailwind. But what's crazy is no green braised killed
[02:00:37] in action. That's amazing. The reconnified mass. That's just an incredible operation.
[02:00:49] Is so successful as so many levels and the fact that the Hords were coming by day four
[02:00:59] day finally reacting. Many reacted was enough to take the pressure off the CIA operation.
[02:01:04] So they were missing a cop with the bonuses of hitting the command center and then the other
[02:01:10] cache what they blew up with tons of rice weapons trucks etc. The fireworks went on for quite
[02:01:19] a while. They might be out of base camp in the spare time. Amazing. And I mean just the
[02:01:30] the mission focus from Maccarley just to get you look we get shot at while we're on insert.
[02:01:40] Yeah we got PUSCO going. We get contacted we're still going we get wounded we're still going
[02:01:45] we get more wounded we're still going. We find an enemy base camp are we going to
[02:01:50] are we going to back away? No we're going to attack it. Yeah we're going to keep going.
[02:01:54] He's relentless told me relentless. Oh I think example of a guy learned from the a.o.
[02:02:01] Applied in the field and then do it at such a level. No always change the direction so the
[02:02:07] NVA wouldn't be sure where they're gone and moving at night at night. You guys didn't move
[02:02:13] much at night normally. Recall we never did a couple of guys may have gone away with that but not us.
[02:02:19] No when we were at night we we honkered down and they had good enough weather that they could
[02:02:26] click in with you know specter shadow, stinger and it made a difference and we may have
[02:02:34] downplayed a caigine everybody couldn't even remember how many gunships they went through at night
[02:02:40] but every night they went through all they used them. Seals moved at night during Vietnam.
[02:02:46] That was like one of the things that they did that was like outside the box you know
[02:02:52] was they that's what that's one of the things that they did was they moved at night.
[02:02:56] I don't know how they did it but they did it. Yeah.
[02:03:03] Now you kind of you kind of referred to this earlier these guys do this beyond heroic
[02:03:08] operation of course no one ever hears about it because it's soggy you guys all signed at 20
[02:03:14] year you know oath of silence on this stuff and all the air crews were told before they went in
[02:03:23] everybody you know of course they won a sky-rated people they wasn't S.O.P. with them
[02:03:30] but there's a lot of new troops coming down there but the hill cop the crews the
[02:03:35] co-operations even though they you know scar face had been doing across the fence
[02:03:41] missions for a long time they were all brief when we're done here you don't talk about it.
[02:03:47] Yeah and and we kind of breeze through it but also you heard Maccarly say that I think it was
[02:03:52] Maccarly say that because it was so secretive these a lot of these pilots they didn't get any
[02:03:57] recognition at all. I mean you're freaking flying a helicopter into an LZ where there's massive
[02:04:03] machine gun fire to extract guys I mean that's just insane bravery. Right and know again the beauty
[02:04:10] of talking to people after you write the book I taught the Tom Stump and Gene on that one
[02:04:17] point when they were together we had a reunion a tailwind reunion a few years ago in Tennessee
[02:04:24] and their Gene Maccarly said had you not done that we would have been done right then and
[02:04:31] because they were really up against the wave attacks but at point and they're low in ammo
[02:04:36] and Tom Stump he said you literally say they're ass right there and he came through the clouds
[02:04:42] somehow these A1 piles and Tom Stump those guys how they get through the clouds to get down to
[02:04:50] be critical mass danger close and to save their ass I mean and they're just wonderful we just love
[02:04:59] that's why we feel like the sky-rated piles were saints. Yeah the the seals had a relationship like
[02:05:06] like that with the with the sea wolves the the nature of the copper pilots and we've had a couple
[02:05:11] sea wolves on here and a legend freaking badass same thing same they were going like if they got the
[02:05:18] call they were going that's all there was to it scrambled the sea wolves all right cool what he got
[02:05:22] what we're gonna get you out and the sea wolf history is they were kind of like treated like
[02:05:27] Steph Jeff for sure they had to go out scrouse the whole time and yet when it came time those guys flew
[02:05:32] and they were good another legend absolutely man can heroic oh yes so these guys do this heroic
[02:05:41] operation and you mentioned this earlier and I'm gonna go to the book 28 years after one of the
[02:05:45] most successful operations run in the 1970 run in 1970 during the eight-year secret war operation
[02:05:51] tailwind CNN that's the cable new news network broadcast a disgraceful erroneous story that
[02:05:59] stained the reputation of the men who participated in that mission portraying them as war criminals
[02:06:05] and set a reporting the facts of the successful mission CNN accused the green berets and airmen of
[02:06:10] gassing American POWs held captive in louss with deadly seren gas CNN used that air laden net
[02:06:19] work work a fiction in an effort to compete with CBS's popular 60-minute program when it launched a
[02:06:26] new program on June 7 1998 called new stand the title of the bogus slanderist story entitled
[02:06:35] Valley of Death it alleged that 16 green berets and 120-indiged troops from operation tailwind
[02:06:42] had destroyed a village and killed innocent women and children while directing US aircraft the
[02:06:47] drop lethal seren nerve gas on US war defectors they said were POWs of the communist
[02:06:54] to compound the egregious attack against America's finest soldiers in airmen the next day
[02:07:00] time magazine repeated the hideous allegations in the news story written by CNN staff members
[02:07:06] headline did the US drop nerve gas it was written by CNN producer all April Oliver and CNN
[02:07:16] international correspondent Peter Arneut who produced the CNN story that aired June 7th the broadcast
[02:07:24] and time article smeared the men of operation tailwind which was conducted
[02:07:30] during the eight-year secret war in louss during the Vietnam War and run under the ages of military
[02:07:35] assistance command Vietnam studies an operation group or simply sog there was an additional political
[02:07:48] ramification stemming from the CNN time magazine report in 1998 at a July 21st 1998 press conference
[02:07:57] repudiating the CNN time report then secretary defense William Cohen said quote the charge would
[02:08:03] be used to discredit the united states attempt to curb the proliferation periffelation of weapons
[02:08:10] of mass destruction in fact Iraq immediately incorporated CNN's charges into its anti-use
[02:08:17] anti-US propaganda effort to try and deflect attention from its own outlawed chemical and biological
[02:08:24] weapons programs end quote. Cohen ordered a full scale across the board investigation of the CNN
[02:08:32] time story from all military branches involved in operation tailwind while requesting at the same
[02:08:38] time from the CIA and the joint chiefs of staffs of course these guys found up you know reported
[02:08:44] what had really happened and then there's some retractions and some apologies
[02:08:53] secretary Cohen said I think all Americans should know that the 16 men who conducted this mission were
[02:08:57] heroes but that that they had been have been hurt by this report I can assure you that you and your
[02:09:03] colleagues and your families you did nothing wrong and he's obviously he's addressing the the men.
[02:09:10] Quite the contrary you did everything right 16 Americans fought steadily for four days all of the
[02:09:15] more injured all got out alive the documents that they captured provided intelligence bananza
[02:09:21] general Abrams the commander of our troops in Vietnam said tailwind was a valuable operation
[02:09:26] executed with great scale and tremendous courage. Cohen told reporters that after rigorous review of
[02:09:32] thousands of pages of documents statements and after acting reports the military ordinance and
[02:09:36] weapon storage records quote we found no evidence to support CNN time assertions we have found
[02:09:42] absolutely no evidence to support these charges CNN and time retracted their reports noting
[02:09:48] that they could not support either charge on July 2nd 1998 in a CNN retraction
[02:09:55] CNN news group chairman president CEO Tom Johnson said an independent investigation concluded that
[02:10:01] the report quote cannot be supported there was insufficient evidence that serenor any other deadly
[02:10:07] gas was used and CNN could not confirm that American defectors were targeted at the camp as
[02:10:13] news stand reported we apologize to our viewers and to our colleagues at time for this mistake
[02:10:20] CNN owes a special apology to the personnel involved in operation tailwind both soldiers on the ground
[02:10:26] and the US Air Force pilots and US Marine Corps helicopter pilots who were involved in the action
[02:10:33] on July 13th time magazine printed in apologies to its readers had vined tailwind and apology
[02:10:41] they noted that the allegations reported on June 7th and 8th 1998 could not quote be supported by the
[02:10:46] evidence and quote in July 14th 1998 Ted Turner wrote a letter to Macartley quote I hope you
[02:10:54] accept my personal apology for the CNN newsstands recent erroneous reporting on operation tailwind
[02:11:00] this entire episode has been very painful for me as the founder of CNN however my greatest
[02:11:05] distress comes from knowing that our coverage upset those on the front line of operation tailwind
[02:11:10] the soldiers on the ground and the US Air Force and Marine Corps pilots engaged in the
[02:11:14] action and quote Macartley said in a 2015 interview quote I personally spoke to Ted Turner
[02:11:22] and he reiterated that he wrote what he wrote in the letter he also told me he was going to call
[02:11:26] the other members of our team and write them a letters of apology to my best to the best of my
[02:11:32] knowledge that did not happen and quote Larry grow a marine core helicopter door gunner who
[02:11:38] survived the operation tailwind added I felt really betrayed by CNN for allowing those reporters
[02:11:44] to publish all those lies and twisting the statements from those who were interviewed CNN showed me
[02:11:50] how the news media can twist a story to fit its needs and have never really trusted any of the
[02:11:56] other media 100% in their reporting since then.
[02:12:02] Interviewed in 2016 retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mel Swanson who is the commanding officer
[02:12:10] of the daring A1 Skyrader pilots remain brutally bitter about CNN's false story quote
[02:12:16] Operation Tailwind was the classic example of inter-service cooperation in that area of operations
[02:12:22] think about it America's finest the green berets and their loyal troops kicked ass and took
[02:12:27] numbers on the ground deep in enemy territory the tactical air support from the Air Force
[02:12:32] fast movers C130 gunships are beloved age A1 H spads in combination with Marine Corps Scarface
[02:12:40] Cobre gunships army army cobras and Marine Corps dimmers raised hell in the enemies backyard
[02:12:46] we killed hundreds of these comic bastards and thanks to that green beret medic all were kept alive
[02:12:52] until the final extraction when one montnard soldier was killed until 1998 I occasionally watched
[02:13:00] the communist news network but after they ruined our reputations I never watched again it was a
[02:13:05] crime against our warriors what they did it was a travesty of justice.
[02:13:14] Amen yeah I mean obviously right now we're living in a you know this is 1998 and and the
[02:13:23] media's even more partisan and they take stories all the time and run with these stories and
[02:13:31] and a lot of times it's it happens so much that it's we forget what it does the actual people
[02:13:38] that are victims of the stories these false stories that come out and so you know you get a
[02:13:44] situation like this these guys and you know you know it's thinking about you know Mike Rose
[02:13:50] who who had to make that decision out in the jungle that he's gonna leave you know his his
[02:13:55] his in-ditch troops out there that were dead he's leaving the bodies and he's tore up over that
[02:14:00] for for his whole life since then oh absolutely and then you get a story like this comes out
[02:14:06] it's um yeah it's a it's a travesty and they knew it was coming so I mean they knew it was a
[02:14:13] story coming but they didn't know it's gonna have that negative edge to it and the distorted
[02:14:18] inaccuracies so somebody's got lined up their families set down a front to TV Mike Hagen
[02:14:25] and Mike Rose were two of the come to mind right away because they had their files hey we're
[02:14:31] gonna be all seen and then tonight and then halfway through the broadcast when that true tone comes out
[02:14:38] and the founder of the cell like your work criminals and and then Mike had to explain to his
[02:14:43] daughter Mike Rose and he was just devastated and he had to sit there and try to explain to you
[02:14:51] and these kids see things on TV TV's never wrong and look at dad with a little bit of cross-eyed
[02:14:58] but horribly impact on a personal level nobody ever hears about you alluded to this earlier because
[02:15:16] of the secrecy of sock and what you guys were doing there's a bunch of reasons because the
[02:15:22] secrecy of sock because the number of guys that were doing turnover so you got guys coming in
[02:15:29] and leaving and then the number guys that are wounded the number of guys that are killed the number
[02:15:34] guys that are missing there's a lot of sock operators that as as we mentioned earlier never
[02:15:41] met the pilots that were supporting them and so you'd get these guys and never seen yeah
[02:15:46] but then and you again you alluded this to this earlier in 2016 go into the book the first
[02:15:52] operation tailwind reunion was held at the Tennessee Museum of Aviation bringing together for the
[02:15:58] first time in more than 45 years some of the men from all of the aviation units and some of the
[02:16:03] special forces soldiers from that unique mission featuring B company commander Jean McCartley the
[02:16:10] commanding officer of the A1 skyrators Mel Swanson and the pilots who flew Marine Corps cobre gunships
[02:16:17] from Scarface the CH53 pilots and a few forward air controllers with tears in his eyes
[02:16:24] Swanson said I hope this is the first of more reunions like it to see how grateful the men of
[02:16:29] sock were for our support during those hairy pre-refire missions touches me through and through
[02:16:36] as well as the other pilots here today we always wondered who those crazy fuckers on the ground
[02:16:41] were and now thanks to the reunions and this reunion we get to meet them and I can't tell you how
[02:16:47] much this means to me on a personal level is the as the commander who sent our A1 pilots into harm's
[02:16:52] way every day to learn how much they appreciated us in the a.o. it's gratifying beyond words
[02:16:58] Scarface pilot Barry Pensick am I saying that right just handshake Pensick Pensick
[02:17:10] Scarface pilot Barry Pensick told the audience that when the Marines went across the fence
[02:17:17] into louse quote they made us change our call sign for some reason they called them mission 72
[02:17:22] when we went across the fence whenever we ran a mission 72 for some reason they had us take
[02:17:28] off our dog tags leave our wall at home so you couldn't be identified as if you go down in an
[02:17:34] American made helicopter and you're a white brown-go-right guy round eye in an Asian country and
[02:17:39] no one's gonna know you're American I never understood the logic of that then in a closing note
[02:17:48] Pensick turned to the audience and apologized to the ladies and advanced for contaminating
[02:17:54] the spoken word with profanities to summarize the time he spent during that operation I can't
[02:18:00] think of another way to say this he said apologetically for example if someone is really good he's a hot
[02:18:07] shit if something was good it was shit hot if you get into a bad situation it was a shit sandwich
[02:18:16] Don Persky mentioned the same which we got into earlier if you had your act together you had your shit
[02:18:22] together and I would like to say that I was honored to have a week or so to spend with all these people
[02:18:28] here and a bunch of others and that they were a bunch of hot shit guys on a shit hot mission
[02:18:35] and that we got into a shit sandwich but we had our shit together in the end no shit airborne
[02:18:42] is that a great line or that is a great line that is a great line so you know one thing I want to
[02:18:55] mention is that Mike Rosen on October 23rd 2017 received the the Medal of Honor oh yeah
[02:19:04] so that's the White House for President Trump and it shows you that you know even though it wasn't
[02:19:11] known about at the time the heroism of these guys was just well that's the highest honor that
[02:19:18] that that that person can be can receive so salute to those guys and and man what a mission now
[02:19:31] I'm going to jump ahead and look we're we're not covering all of soccer on the
[02:19:34] circles by the way that was one mission to cover in this volume one of song chronicles um but one of the
[02:19:41] things that when I started reading I read a quote that said you know as of June 13 2017
[02:19:47] there were still 50 green berets listed as MIA in Lousalone along with at least 105 aviators who
[02:19:53] died supporting song missions they are among the total of approximately 260 aviators mission
[02:20:00] missing in Lousalone as of this printing now there's a there's a story in here and I don't
[02:20:09] want to go through the whole thing um because people should get the book and read through it
[02:20:16] but on a high level because it ties into the you know this the MIAs that are still out there
[02:20:23] can you tell us a little bit about RT and truetor and and what happened on that on that operation
[02:20:30] I'll sure um they went into the target and um made enemy contact and uh they had to
[02:20:38] pull that on strings so the first helicopter came in pulled out the first half of the team RT and
[02:20:44] truetor the second helicopter came in again with strings the pull them out and they had two Americans
[02:20:52] three Americans are on on the strings and maybe one of the days I forget about the
[02:20:56] indigenous and as they're lifting off one of Robskot Tangled the trees and Sammy Hernandez
[02:21:03] felt at a ground with knocked on conscious so he's on conscious helicopter continues up gets hammered
[02:21:10] turns around spins out of control and then crashed into a granite wall or to a mountain
[02:21:17] killing the entire air crew everybody on the ropes so the next day uh the bright light goes in
[02:21:24] and um maybe in the day or two days later the bright light goes in they get to the crash site
[02:21:34] and they're able to recover all the bodies Sammy Hernandez during the night woke up
[02:21:41] played hiding go seek with the NVA found a uh found a cave or some kind of area where you get out
[02:21:48] away and before we went into the cave he his shoulder was dislocated so he pounded his shoulder
[02:21:54] back into place on a tree then he hid for the night in the morning it first light a cubby came by
[02:22:02] and he had his panel and they were able to strapped him out they came in with the bright light
[02:22:07] got all the bodies put him into body bags moving to a location I forgive they got to the top
[02:22:12] of the mountain or not but Cliff Newman was on that mission and um they went in
[02:22:18] put together of you all the bodies but it was too dark they couldn't come in and get him out
[02:22:24] that night the plan was in the morning they'll come in early well in the morning before any
[02:22:29] aircraft could get there any aircraft cover the NVA hit that team hard and bottle line they couldn't get
[02:22:35] the body sound they'd literally left them there um 35 40 years later Cliff Newman goes back
[02:22:43] in an effort to work with our uh what's now DPA department PLAW MIA County HC and it was the
[02:22:53] predecessor but Cliff went in try to find it they cooperation with the uh in business people
[02:23:02] uh forgive with the lay oceans or the Vietnamese they put them in too far away from the mountain
[02:23:06] they so Cliff went back four or five years ago again the second time and again there are
[02:23:13] two far away so Cliff is waiting for the third call to go back and uh try to help him and this is the
[02:23:21] dedication of Cliff and uh Sammy Hernandez is still alive and of course Cliff Newman was uh and Sammy
[02:23:28] we're on the first team that did the first Halo jump in the layhouse well that's one of the other
[02:23:35] reasons why I don't want to go too much deep detail right now because hopefully we get them on here
[02:23:40] to tell the story oh come back yeah you know and you you think about that you know I just was
[02:23:47] looking through um some of this information Americans Unaccounted for in Southeast Asia
[02:23:54] right now um total of 1,587 and post January 1973 they've repatriated 1,059 from Vietnam, China,
[02:24:13] Laos and Cambodia so we still have work to do there to get these guys back home yeah and even on that
[02:24:23] mission there um the morning that they went in to get to we to pull the recon team out when
[02:24:30] after the recon teams hit we had a cubby that went in and got shot down and they lost all of
[02:24:38] everybody's killed and they um they couldn't get them out right away but eventually I think
[02:24:45] it would now be maybe 10 years ago they got the pile out to recover this body and um so today yeah
[02:24:53] the one thousand five hundred eighty six remaining uh MIAs in Southeast Asia which includes Vietnam
[02:25:01] Laos, Cambodia and China and they're a few of their um piles mostly assume and uh September 18th
[02:25:13] will be the Peel the National Peel WMIA recognition day when there'll be vent held across the
[02:25:21] country and of course you have the iconic Peel WMIA flag that's now uh but authorized by President
[02:25:29] Trump to be flown off federal buildings throughout the year now every day trying to keep
[02:25:34] attention focused at that level um anything that we can do to help out on that stuff um
[02:25:44] boom well there's a lot of issues attached to it but the most important thing is to keep um
[02:25:51] keep people writing their congressmen and say please keep the efforts going forward on this for
[02:25:56] the for the Americans from Southeast Asia because what's working against this in addition
[02:26:02] Mother Nature again is the most acidic soil in the world eventually eats up bones maybe teeth
[02:26:09] and so um who knows how much longer the remains will be and um you know for my case we
[02:26:18] a spider-pat walk in the land black the MIA is the people we knew who our teammates they're now part of that
[02:26:26] and we still hope the someday at least get the remains back someday maybe not I think there's going
[02:26:32] to have to be somebody somewhere it's going to say we have to end it but until they do um the
[02:26:40] what's really amazing the young teams that they get out there for DPA they're dedicated these kids
[02:26:45] go out their army marine corps they usually take a medic an sf medic with them now and these
[02:26:53] kids are dedicated they really do a great job we like to see a little bit more coming from mid-management
[02:27:00] at DPA turns into commitment they're really pushed this thing keep it in public side
[02:27:07] and and the president Trump's been supportive of it and um that's what we can do we're at the
[02:27:13] uh we're at the mercy of time here and the effort yeah I know they would send guys I know guys
[02:27:20] in the sealed teams friends of mine that would go to Vietnam to support those operations look oh yeah
[02:27:27] it's like no inter-service rye over here no for all Americans no matter what service and it's been
[02:27:34] teams that've gone in for over 40 years now you know I forget the exact date but I think it's June
[02:27:41] no they always stopped to talk about the aircraft that was a j-pack aircraft loaded with people
[02:27:48] going for a mission aircraft and we lost several Americans as well as indigenous people working
[02:27:54] with us on that so it's a deadly mission it's been a long battle and do you have the uh the
[02:28:02] National Peel WMA family League of Families National League of Peel WMA families have been fighting this war
[02:28:09] the effort to bring home identify bring home they remains with many Americans we can and
[02:28:17] did they were the first people in any war we fought that demanded that the enemy treat our
[02:28:24] prisoners better during the Vietnam war and then they had another name I figured it was but then
[02:28:29] they necessarily became eventually became the National League of Peel WMA families the director
[02:28:35] CEO is Anne Mills Griffith she her father started when her brother went down in September of
[02:28:42] 66 as a navy back seat her in that four and that family's been involved ever since and she's been

[02:33:34] took off and continued to fight you know you you you talk with such a reverence for all the other
[02:33:40] service branches and it's the same you know when when when we were in the battle of Ramadi
[02:33:45] there was just no rivalry whatsoever and I've never had I didn't really have some big rivalry going
[02:33:51] into it I'd never really cared I was thought we were on the same team but some people some people
[02:33:55] take that stuff pretty seriously but man on the ground in the battle of Ramadi it was just
[02:34:00] brothers and and across the board and sisters as well because there's females they're fighting
[02:34:06] and females that were killed in action and but just nothing but reverence for the soldiers
[02:34:14] the sailors the airman marines that we work with salute to all of them and and certainly I know
[02:34:20] you feel the same way as you talk but hey once again thanks for coming back we got to get the

[02:35:04] man like a bad dream we'll be back and with that tilt has left the building
[02:35:13] unbelievable opportunity to sit here and talk to these guys and learn these stories so many
[02:35:23] stories you know after we after we turned off the mics I started getting kind of crazy talking to
[02:35:28] tilt I was saying hey when you're talking about 600 hand grenades getting thrown each one of
[02:35:34] those hand grenades that gets thrown by the enemy into your position is a whole story there's a whole
[02:35:40] story behind it hey grenade you know right where to come from I got them over there
[02:35:45] start putting down fire I'm like that's a whole story each one oh god wait Jimmy's wounded each one
[02:35:52] of these events 600 grenades each one of those events is a micro story yeah each one of these hey
[02:36:02] in in two lines in this book that we just read in two lines it's like um hey there was
[02:36:09] enemy bunkers who were cleared by the montn yards yeah wait wait a second that's a freaking
[02:36:17] chapter two chapters or three chapters or a whole book in itself clearing up enemy bunker
[02:36:23] filled with the or the NVA fighters what's happening what are we talking about so
[02:36:31] to be able to sit here and talk to these guys and and and tilt wasn't on that particular mission
[02:36:35] but he has you know he has first hand experience in the a.o he lived through it and it's just awesome
[02:36:43] so I appreciate the opportunity to do this and and one of the reasons we have the opportunity this
[02:36:48] is because y'all give us support support support support as we like to call it echo somebody wants to
[02:36:56] support this podcast here and while they're supporting this podcast they actually want to provide
[02:37:02] themselves with some support yep is it closer support not really but it could be considered
[02:37:11] on some level it is well let's just say this it might not be closer support but it is definitely
[02:37:17] support it is support for sure and you know for one self you know to support others you do have to
[02:37:24] support yourself right like I said I said it before I say it again it's like you know when you're in the
[02:37:30] airplane and oxygen mask comes down what are they instructed you to do put on yourself then you
[02:37:35] help your small infant child whatever the case so kind of the same situation all right so we're
[02:37:41] working out we're keeping ourselves on the path on the path isn't just such some so-tark thing
[02:37:47] by the way it's keeping your shit together dang I like it it is 100% in every way you can by the way
[02:37:55] mental physical uh social social meaning like this your relationships with people in and outside
[02:38:01] your family anyway you understand you're gonna know if you're doing something off the path versus
[02:38:05] something on the path you're gonna know pretty clear so anyway so when working out we could benefit
[02:38:14] from supplementation we could use some air support some air so 11 of support yes there you go support
[02:38:22] is way better than no support yes it is 100% so jocco has you covered we have you covered we all
[02:38:28] have ourselves covered as well jocco fuel supplementation for you joints important they're
[02:38:34] important okay so I'm I'm I'm not one of these guys who have these crazy joint problems but
[02:38:43] from time to time I'll get jammed up you know the kind when you wake up you walk down stairs
[02:38:48] if you walk down stairs too quick you're like you can feel it you seem saying you didn't know what I'm
[02:38:54] talking about you don't feel that that's what you say I certainly don't admit it
[02:39:01] I thought we were all friends here you know but I will say and the point to this and the
[02:39:05] quasi story is that when you think back to those times when you're like all stiff or whatever just
[02:39:12] general stiffness and now you don't have it it's like it's it's a godsend this is what it is
[02:39:20] you don't miss those days we don't want to feel it yeah and it's it's not a big deal when you
[02:39:27] forget it when you don't realize it it seems saying but anyway I realize it a lot so that's why
[02:39:32] it is important to keep taking your joint warfare and cruel oil those are for your joints discipline
[02:39:38] discipline go this is the brain body supplement keep you mentally in the game keep you sharp you have a
[02:39:47] groggy day boom helps you out that is also RTD can it's like an energy drink in the form of
[02:39:58] like a bad word it's like an energy drink is something that you drink that makes you feel good for
[02:40:03] 45 minutes until you crash and burn and you have a freaking insulin level spike yeah and you feel like
[02:40:09] crap because it's filled with sugar and a bunch of chemicals what's going on here no sugar
[02:40:17] no sugar well how does it taste good because it's sweet and with something else called monk fruit which is actually
[02:40:22] good for you it doesn't have 700 milligrams of caffeine no it's got 95 milligrams of caffeine yes good for you
[02:40:29] you get that little afternoony hitter yes so to sum it up I guess it's a brain health drink
[02:40:40] in the form of an energy drink loosely we'll say loosely we haven't figured out what exactly
[02:40:48] we've made it's a new category potentially yeah it's good nonetheless got some good flavors on
[02:40:55] there good some flavors coming up oh as well it's so exciting not there you go I'm not saying it's my
[02:41:01] new flavor I'm not saying it's not my new for I'm just saying we have some various flavors coming up
[02:41:07] anyway yes that's discipline and discipline go there's also the the capsules you know if you're
[02:41:11] in a in a rush or would have you yeah there's that also vitamin D3 and cold war this is for immunity
[02:41:18] so keeping your immune system is keeping it up keeping it strong that's important definitely
[02:41:26] as opposed to unimposed especially right now yes well I don't want to get into a whole debate
[02:41:35] but I think that immune system is important at all times okay that's what I think I'm going with it
[02:41:41] all right I'm very very cool also what we got milk jocco milk protein in the form of dessert
[02:41:47] all different or dessert in the form of protein you know what I'm saying yes they do yeah
[02:41:53] same deal with some new flavors coming out and I'll tell you what I'll tell you what we got
[02:41:59] some flavors coming out oh for oh yes yes and they are legit legit you want to know what one of
[02:42:08] them is yeah smashing pumpkin it's like I didn't even know what this was yes yeah I didn't even know
[02:42:18] what this was I didn't even know what this thing yeah be a little sensitive to me he goes he goes
[02:42:23] dude you gotta try this and I'm like send it yeah it sends it out and I wasn't even I didn't even
[02:42:27] know I liked this flavor smashing pumpkins yeah but well smashing pumpkins is a band yeah
[02:42:38] okay you already knew that your fan you're a smash pumpkin absolutely yeah me too actually
[02:42:42] anyway that's a band pumpkin spice the flavor is like a thing like oh yeah and I didn't know that
[02:42:49] yeah and that makes sense because I mean I knew of it but just in the past like few years or whatever
[02:42:54] it's been getting a lot of like teasing and stuff like oh pumpkin spice I don't you know
[02:43:02] that I don't know anything about that I know yeah I mean I have to pull this flavor down because it's a week no I
[02:43:08] think like since it's been in the what he call like spotlight or whatever and people will be like
[02:43:14] oh I don't know it's like they've been teasing it for some reason like you're some prep you
[02:43:18] okay well you can tease pumpkin spice but trust me you're not going to tease smashing pumpkin
[02:43:23] well here's the way you also said smashing pumpkins that's plural that's a band that's not the
[02:43:28] name yes smash pumpkin we're going singular yeah yeah I dig it because you know we want to
[02:43:33] want to in fringe no no no you don't know you don't know in fringe but no the pumpkin spice so
[02:43:39] that's the thing where it's almost like part of the reason or part of the whole teasing
[02:43:44] culture of it for lack of a better way of putting it um was that everyone likes pumpkin spice
[02:43:50] but you know like it's like if you're like tough you don't want to like admit it like everyone
[02:43:54] it pumps the spice freaking delicious in your cafe latte or whatever like whatever it's always
[02:43:59] still everyone knows that you know that's like kind of the thing that's why I'm I'm going to be
[02:44:03] on some a little bit excited for pumpkin spice first smashing pumpkin we're not doing pumpkin
[02:44:08] spice we're doing smashing pumpkin because I'm starting to see the connection here that you're

[02:44:16] but it's filled with protein that will make you strong turn you into a destroyer there you go yeah
