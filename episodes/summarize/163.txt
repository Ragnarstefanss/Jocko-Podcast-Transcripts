but it also gave me a decent amount of time at this point it was another year before we started the medical retirement process which actually took two years so it carried me to 21 years and it gave me a lot of time to really look at you know where does my future go from here and kind of lay out what are my new passions what is my purpose and where do I go from this life after the military what can I do with all these lessons that I've learned and you know how do I pay it forward how do I honor Ryan how do I honor all these guys that every day I walk by this granite wall and they didn't get a choice they didn't get a choice to come home so thankfully you know I had that time it's still within the community but also coming to grips with the fact that you know like I talked to those young men about so many people are so strongly tied to what they do for a living that they cannot function if suddenly it's taken away from them there's a lot of a lot of me to a lot of police officers and firefighters or professional athletes that if suddenly their career is over they don't know how to function without that they've they've tied their identity so much around what they've done and I realized that the lessons that I learned in the the the seal teams and this journey that I been on was incredibly relatable and it was had nothing to do with tactical lessons you know I didn't need to be the guy that got out and taught you how to shoot or do anything and that like that what I realized is there were amazing life lessons the lessons human lessons lessons in leadership and teamwork and overcoming adversity in this idea of helping people you know not only survive but thrive from crisis and ambushes so that really started to become the path that I was walking and to help other wounded warriors well I just want to wrap this last little section of the book because we're talking about the identity and what you invested your life into and you say this I held the trident in my hand this golden emblem had driven my life I focused on it I coveted it but you know the process of the mission is the same I mean I know probably you up talked other people you know the guys that did the bin Laden raid the mechanics of that mission were the same it was just a level you know how we take down a target is pretty much the same regardless of where you go and it was the same for this case there were just some things that made us go maybe we should prepare a little more you guys roll on the target and the thing is get pretty intense pretty quick once you've once you've hit the target you've got it secured now we got some squirgers meaning some folks that we think have run away from the target building again I'm not going to go into the full detail of the mission which you did a beautiful job of explaining what this was like in the book and that's why people get the books they can read it but as we mentioned earlier this ends up in a firefight in your in it going back to the book I keyed my radio and called J.P. troops and contact troops and contact I have three wounded including me the machine guns were still blazing away at us and they walked their barrels right and left Chris crossing our positions with hundreds of 7.62 millimeter bullets I recognize that if I didn't get a turner kit on what I thought was the stump of my left arm I was going to bleed out I looked back at Al and the rest of my team behind the tire yeah you know and this is an interesting fact you know I talked to a lot of other team guys about this I think a lot of us we do a really good job in the seal teams and you know I'd like to assume other military units do the same we do a really good job of preparing guys if they get killed you know page two we make sure they're all taken care of I don't think any of us ever give much thought I should if I was severely wounded I think most of us think one side of the coin is you know it'll be merely a flesh wound you know and I was like no way am I going to allow that to happen it is a choice and that's what people need to understand you know having a positive attitude on how you handle the situations you're in is a choice and the more you accept positivity and drive it forward the more you actually start to believe it and it will create momentum and that's really what happened with that sign I said I will not allow that to happen again no one will come in here and be sad because I refuse I will not allow it and you never know the impact of the decision that you're going to make you you never know how even though deep down inside you were like you know holy shit how do I get out of this situation but you project that positivity who you can bring with you and bring up and how much you can leave an impact of the last of lifetime that sign has gone on to help hundreds of thousands of people I've had people write me that have had cancer I've had people that have written me that have had major horrific accidents I didn't keep the sign I had it framed and it hangs in the wounded ward at Walter Reed and the bottom of the sign is like rub clean now and I'm told that all these wounded warriors whenever they go to a surgery they go by and they rub it but you know you're trying to make calls you're trying to let people know what's going on you're trying to decipher the situation because it was a rough situation that you guys were in and you end up you know get next-directed your boys took care of you they did I owe my life to those guys I mean they fought back that gunship overhead you know for special operations squadron I owe my life to those guys that was the closest fire mission ever in the Iraq war we were well well they wouldn't bring in that mission because we were we were literally within any danger growth close programmer there were the machine guns that had me pinned down we're about 45 feet 50 feet away so Al did an amazing job I mean this was his third combat deployment you know experience jac experience team leader and you know really you too there's a good on the video version of this podcast too by the way so you know you can see what everybody looks like if you hear about that sort of thing people watch people watch ones with guests because they want to see what they know what I look like they know what echo looks like they want to see what Jay Redmond looks like they want to see what a what does a man look like that took a round three of the face right there come on at that point they stop the podcast and press play on YouTube that's what you're saying so what it is got a brand problem going on good opportunity look forward actually I like that like a for you know because there's a lot of different approaches you know like you say get off the X and like look forward absolutely you have to show any people look back they look back what they've lost yeah back what's going on right now kind of thing which is natural by the way and I tell people that you know you have to push yourself into those zones and discomfort so that you can handle these hard situations when they come because if you've never forge yourself if you've never been put into these areas it discomfort you're going to be crushed when they come because you're not going to be ready I was so ready for that moment when it came I mean you know took me about 36 hours after I got home to figure it out but still that's pretty quick for a devastating injury like that and I never looked back you're your in Bethesda and just just to kind of give a little bit of detail around that you got some doctor named female doctor named Dr. Malard and here we go back to the book kind of she's about to list your kind of your situation that you're in with energetic bluntness she laid out the extent to my wounds the machine gun bullet entered just in front of my right ear it shattered my job vaporized my right or burrow floor destroyed my cheek and exit through my nose I'd suffered nerve damage as well virtually nothing was left to my cheek bone or ocular floor bones on the right side of my face she and her team was amazed I didn't suffer greater I damage but you know it's a great school everyone I know that the range is that I know are awesome guys so great school but oftentimes we use it in the seal teams maybe punishment is the wrong word in some cases I know it's been punishment occasionally a guy I want to go there but generally guys I mean generally guys are working so I'm not going to go to range your school you end up getting the range of school and here we go sick hungry burning with resentment because as you said you're not at this point you're still like yeah just kind of learning from him well one of the this this was another bit of a of a surprise to me again this is the kind of thing that I never had to think about but here you go go back to book in the months that followed I knew that I was in for the long game the slog through surgeries and setbacks continue and again you got to read this book to realize the absolute just medical uh medical trauma that you're going through day in day out and this really drove it home to me I called it medical bud there you go it's really what it was medical buds and here's here's one thing that just hit me like a ton of bricks by the summer of 2009 I was starting to run low on the available patches of skin for grafting my body was rope with scars from surgical sites and over a dozen graphs that to me I'm thinking myself I mean you're running out of skin to graft to do to do damage repair to your face what is that process like so a lot of times they harvest the skin from you know your thighs and areas and and it wasn't that I was just running out of skin they were running on the skin because I've got quite a few tattoos so my back is totally tattooed you know I called the Fred and asked if the western Overwatch team was still in place gunfire erupted over the radio as he heat his mic and answered I think so okay good that gave us eyes above and control over the high ground over there this is the moment Jay go prove yourself as we dropped off the lip senior chief carry called to me over the radio and wanted to know what I was doing we're going down I told him he went ballistic absolutely not we need to link back up fall back the boys needed help and we were closest if it had been anybody else I might have thought twice about his call but my own personal quest to prove myself coupled with my intense hatred for him clouded my judgment I ignored him and we pressed on as we dropped further into the valley we lost all communication with the headquarters team I began to realize what a hairy situation I had just placed the two of us in we had given up the high ground to move down a thousand feet of vertical terrain to try and link up with an element under fire with an enemy force almost one kilometer away I pushed this thought to the back of my mind the boys need help focus on that but where was the fight the sounds of battle echoed all across the valley making it difficult to calculate distance and direction a broken transmission filled my earpiece I couldn't tell what it was but I recognized Jaydee's voice I tried to establish contact a moment later through washers of static Jaydee's voice came back where the hell are you Jaydee demanded I told him we were at the tea intersection on the valley floor get your ass out of the valley now he said with so much anger I could almost feel a blast of fire shoot out of the earpiece I was about to explain my intent when he added those guys are in a major fight and we can't call in close air support because we don't know where you are that shook me there were aircraft over head waiting to join the battle with rockets and bombs yet they could not make their runs because of my decision to go into the valley I should have thought about art air assets it was exciting because it suddenly rangerschool suddenly became a new opportunity and really I set my sights on you know kind of interestingly enough I think all of us are super gold ribbon people and for the first time I saw an opportunity and and set a goal you know which is what I think all of us do so well at you know we we have a target to move to and now I have a path to go after it and that that path became I want to graduate the honor man of this course and set it set you know woke up the next morning firing up the guys around me and hey man we're getting ready to start up again it's going to be awesome let's go do this the the trust when broken is extremely hard to rebuild and I get asked a lot how do you build trust with people either whether it's been broken or whether you don't know them and it's very clear in the book and again this is why people should get the book the way that you're asking to commander and I'm trying to think of the alias because I know them to jp the way that you're asking to commander is very common to what a guy does he gives you a little bit of responsibility and let you let you earn a little bit of trust and then once you've earned a little bit of trust gives you a little bit more responsibility once you earned a little bit more trust and that continued going this is this is now a six month appointment plus a year long work up or whatever so keys been giving you a little bit of trust and you've been earning and earning and earning back your trust and you are digging out of a deficit right and you know when I when I kick off the book that I wrote with a extreme ownership you know kicks off with a blue on blue and you know it was it was a lot of bad things happening there was a lot of moving parts going on it was a horrible situation and a rocky soldier got killed several more got wounded one of my guys got wounded and I can tell you right now like I think if I would have said hey this wasn't my fault blame it on someone else yeah burning with resentment I went into the first few days without my heart or mind engaged the first week of Ranger School is nothing but a gut check long days with minimal sleep exposure the elements in constant physical and mental evolutions to get those who don't want to be there to quit teamwork leadership within a circle of peers and decision making under stressful conditions where the objective of this first phase as a seal I should have represented my community in the best possible manner while by displaying leadership a commitment to teamwork and a willingness to overcome obstacles instead my actions showed me to be arrogant ill tempered and unwilling to work with others many soldiers falsely believe that seals are like that and my actions re-simply reinforced it I failed to represent my community as anything but that stereotype so you have this bad attitude you go out on a compass course you're pretty good at land nav you think you're gonna kick ass you don't kick ass you do a bad job the black hat to the Ranger instructors here we go the black hat's chuckled with laughter damn squid got lost we should have given you a boat swabby another growl not surprising seals know how to navigate anyways I failed at something I once took great pride in not so good without your Gucci gear are you another sneered I lost it all my pent up fury frothed out of me screw this course and screw you kiss my ass I walked up to my company instructor and told them I'm out of here I quit are you sure you want to do that without thinking I said yes I was reading this book and I was like day I was thinking damn and it it just manifested itself in that moment where I failed the land nav course because of my own arrogance and then you know I allowed those Ranger instructors to get under my skin in that failure instead of immediately saying well hey no big deal I could have gone back and done it again like three days later because there I wasn't the only guy that failed there were other guys that failed but instead of that I instantly just it was one additional blow that I had sustained and being at this tipping point you know I allowed them to get under my skin and snapped and it is the only thing I have ever quit in my life that I have verbally quit I mean for all intense and purposes I rang the bell in that moment and so angry and frustrated and listened to that demon that said your career is over you will never recover from this you know this is the final straw you know you had an opportunity and you missed it man I they're like I don't even know how your arms work and the way it is so when I met the guy from Duke who was one of the premier you know hand and arm guys literally the guy that put my arm together was probably the premier hand and arm going I tried to get him to go back and do more and he said no he said there's no way in hell he said your arm he said going into your arm and getting what we got is a miracle he's like I am not going back in and it was at that point that I really started to analyze myself and this something I talked to a lot of people about you know you truly have to know yourself you cannot because our weaknesses manifested themselves in the hardest times they don't come out in the good times and the good times there's no issues with it and the only way you could manage that you know it's to a mental leadership and emotional leadership at the highest level because in the hardest times and usually those in the times you've got to be managing the most is when it comes up and it was by really starting to rip myself apart and look at you know all these things that I had done and understanding and I think you continue to do that obviously every day with what you're doing and how you're doing it and how you're taking the lessons that you learned and bringing them to more people spreading the word broadly what did that transition look like like the you know from the time you got out into where you are now because you know I mean obviously everyone that's in the military right now one day I hate to break the news to y'all one day you're gonna be not in the military anymore bring us from you know the end of your career into where you are now and where your focus right now and what you're doing and so you escalate the deep confliction to a visible laser and then you know they realize that that both sides were friendly and you was a marine core colonel that you were lacing and he wasn't too happy about that and when you when when your commander brought you in and said hey what that'll happen you took ownership of it and said hey here's the mistakes I made instead of blaming everyone else so big big turning point and and I think this is an important point you know you you know I mean within our community it's pretty hard to turn around when you've made a major mistake like that I mean all of you guys get out we've had guys that have been sent to the fleet and some never come back and you know the funny thing is you know I tried to paint it in that moment arguing with J.D that I was doing the right thing I'm taking the fight to the enemy I'm you know supporting my brothers and all this BS you know the reality was I wanted to get in the fight at that point I had been on the edge of a lot of fire fights and you know and even fighting I'm in until you get in there you haven't proved yourself and here here you are you know you're not in the prisoner of war but something as simple as eating a steak and that really like hit me hard because as you know I take steaks very seriously and to think that like for seven months no steak and the daily things and and and that always gets me thinking about the daily things that when I talk to my friends that have been wounded it's like it's the daily everyday things and as matter fact when we had Jim Web on and he was talking about one of his friends that have been wounded in Vietnam and he's like that's the daily courage like that guy was courageous in Vietnam I let it burn and blow up so it was you know really it was these moments and this is probably the biggest thing that I can tell anybody out there it is never too late you can always come back so for for months I had convinced myself that I was a victim for months I had convinced myself there was no way to do this and for the first time when I finally looked at you know these are your weaknesses but all by the way man you got some amazing strengths and you know you need to figure out how to amplify these strengths minimize these weaknesses and and what an opportunity you have you are a seal that's in Ranger School that could crush this course set the example and come back every day is another opportunity you're going to screw up again and that's okay and then you know I tell people that is the most succinct and powerful leadership advice I've ever been given you know people will follow you if you give them a reason to if you give them something to respect and that really is the foundation of you know the three rules of leadership I talk about lead yourself that's 80% of it you know leading others comes naturally and he was right because I left that office and the the funny thing about it though is I got off the phone what else we got we got on it if we're when you add to your home gym situation your home fitness situation going on at dot com slash joc will let a good stuff on there get a joc rope if you don't like get rings actually rings are hundred percent in my opinion I'm signing on hundred percent the best thing that you can get I mean it's a ring there the food I know where to go over something think it about that for my home gym you know you definitely definitely got to have rings and that's the first thing you need I used to say the first thing you need to use a pull-up bar yeah you at this point you still want to get back to the teams and you're trying to get your arm fixed to the point where you can have enough mobility in it to to change magazines to operate your weapon so you're going to a bunch of different people trying to see who is who can make this happen you finally find a guy that's you know you think you have a good lead on somebody that can make this happen and he you go to see him and he says going back to the book jam gonna be frank with you if you were my son I wouldn't let you do this what you have now is the best possible outcome if you proceed and have another surgery you'll probably lose some of the range of motion you have now worse you'll set yourself up for a lifetime of chronic pain the drive home was a quiet one for me as I deliberated whether or not to roll the dice one last time by the time I turned off the freeway and for Virginia Beach I knew it was not worth the risk my days as an operator were over part of me always suspected this might happen this might happen now it was confirmed I had no epiphanys during the drive home about what to do now as the that dream to kick doors again slipped away what would I do how would I support my family I didn't have any answers but he's courageous every single day takes him X amount of time to get up out of bed takes him X amount of time to get his prosthetics to take some X amount of time to do normal functions that people can normally do easily he's got a struggle with them all he does in every single day without complaining daily courage and so just thinking about you in that situation man awesome I flew to Chicago almost once a month in preparation for my first surgery with Dr. Walton which he'd scheduled for July the airports and their crowds continued to be a torment little kids pointed at me and called to their mothers to look at me too people refused to talk to me they'd act ashamed or embarrassed or they'd set expressions of pity on their faces internally I raged at them are these the people I sacrificed for coming back from a ship of coming back from Chicago on one trip I just broke everyone who stared at me I treated with a sudden boo by the end of the trip though I realized I needed to do something different or the bitterness would eat me alive the game me a thought I came up with an idea I went online and designed a couple t-shirts the first one said stop staring I got shot by a machine gun it would have killed you I put an American flag on the back and called it wounded wear so are you still making wounded wear shirts so when it wears on pause for right now but it will be coming back we've got some work we're getting things online in 2019 you're planting your flag and and putting up your defenses around an indefensible position which is where you ended up here and and you nailed it with the idea you know it's something I know you talked people about a business I talk about I think it's no different probably and fighting you know you've got to let the battle feel developed sometimes we have this natural instinct that when something bad happens when a crisis happens we feel this you know and so all these things you know dangerous you know that not only did you know all these things you have to be careful of I mean this is what falls under you know a lot of people call these different things and my Pentagon of peak performance I call it emotional leadership so your ability to attach yourself for a second and say but I actually continued to spiral down over the next couple of months until finally you know my you know that moment occurred right after you know my judgment had been set upon me which really I was very fortunate because I should have been grateful because really what they could have done is said you're out of here you know we're sending you out of the teams you're going to go before try to review board and I've watched these downward slides and what we're starting to find out is we are creating physiological impacts on the brain from these continued exposures to these blasts so we need more research we need you know we need more non-pharmicological solutions to these problems and there's a lot of things that are out there that are on the forefront so one of the things with research I started doing some stuff with the concussion legacy foundation which is the same group working with the NFL or you know highlighting the impact of CTE on NFL players and we're beginning to realize that some of our special operations guys like Rob Guzo who took his life severe CTE but what they figured out is it's different some of the pre-mear neurologists that are out there are figuring out it's different it's blast and the blast goes all the way through the brain as opposed to a concussion that creates an impact and there's a centralized location now for guys or even Dallas out there that have had multiple concussions that creates more but the bottom line is we need this research and then you ended up coming back to the White House again and we're going back to the book I went to Mike Montsour's metal vowner ceremony in the White House that April Mike was a fellow seal who had jumped on a hand grenade thrown onto a rooftop he had and saved two of his teammates in a firefighting in Ramadi he shielded his brothers with his own body and paid the ultimate price for that devotion it was deeply moving to be there to see Mike's family receive his poshmas metal of honor but while I was there I met another seal named Ryan Job he'd been part of the team three and had served with legendary sniper Chris Kyle and I rack during the 2006 campaign Ryan had been a mark 48 machine gunner for the team and during a firefight that spring of bullet head struck his weapon then hit him in the face destroying his right eye he survived and reached Bethesda much as I would a year later but nerve damage cost him as vision it is left eye the prospect of spending the rest of his life blind had to have been terrifying though he never showed it instead he announced that if he had to be blind he would be the best damn blind man there was so that's where I met you for the first time obviously uh Mikey and Ryan and Chris were all with me and task unit bruiser and you came out for the for the metal of honor ceremony for Mikey and I actually remember looking at you guys you know looking at you guys talking to each other and I actually thought I had pictures of it and you you were a lot more self aware and again you have to read the whole book to get all these details about that transition you were a lot more self aware and you started off as mobility commander and then eventually you started working with the assault team and here we go back to the book after that first successful mission on the assault team I had earned a spot in the mix and harmonized with the task units battle rhythm, arpotoons, rotated back and forth between running mobility or running the assault force the pace was intense and the mission started to blend together in a groundhog day sort of way I may have lost my way years ago but through God and a willingness to work hard and learn my strengths and weaknesses I had earned my way back into the brotherhood and you detail some some good missions some pretty hot missions you know you guys got some pretty good gun fights and you're getting towards the end of deployment and or you can't help though they think they're going to sit on the axe and just get shot up that's the way it's going to be so somebody saw that hey we can get through to this guy you know he's a good team guy and more importantly to that point and this is a great leadership point and organizational point not only are they going to sit there and take those hits because they're too arrogant to be willing to move they're going to pull everybody else down with them and that's where it gets really dangerous I mean especially in our community where lives are on the line Brother thanks for coming on and obviously thanks for your service to our country thanks for what you did for the teams and thanks for what you're continuing to do right now you've sacrificed a lot and you're still out there every day grinding and making things happen thanks for doing that and man over come and of course thanks to all our military personnel that are standing watch around the world to protect our freedoms and utmost appreciation for those wounded warriors like Jay who continue to sacrifice bravely every day for the freedoms that we all enjoy and also thank you to our police law enforcement firefighters paramedics EMT's correctional officers board of patrols all the first responders out there who stand watch on the home front to keep us all safe and to everyone else out there that's listening there really are no excuses they're none men like Jay Redman prove that men like Ryan Job prove that without question so don't allow yourself to fall short don't allow yourself to give anything less than everything you've got to take the fight to the enemy who ever in whatever that enemy might be do what you're supposed to do be who you're supposed to be by going out there every day and getting after it. and it just it continues to have this impact Secretary Gates wrote about the sign in his book Michelle Obama's book just came out she wrote about the sign and what the impact is so one moment of saying I'm not going to allow someone else to drive my thinking makes all the difference and I tell so many people that it is a choice it is a choice you can choose to be a victim and feel sorry for yourself or you can choose to be a vector and drive for it even if you don't believe it in the moment it doesn't matter you know say it live it and start driving forward and that belief will catch fire within you and everybody else around you know doubt about it man and and the unfortunate opposite that is when you start allowing yourself to be negative and you start listening to people that want to be negative and be and drag you down you can easily had to head yourself on that direction I call those people leadership wrecking balls they're good at what they do you know in some ways peak carriers one of those people he was very good at what he did and he got things done but he had a tendency to leave and a lot of organizations have these individuals and they keep them around because they do get things done but they leave a path of destruction behind them and over time people don't want to work with them and you know that's why I call them the leadership wrecking ball and I didn't know Al had even moved me to the tire until months after the fire fight the MetaVac bird arrived a few minutes later and the guys helped us aboard once we were airborne and out of harm's way the remainder of the task unit fell back to the original target compound to wait for extract but the fight was over the gun shot gun ship detected more movement in the thicket enough was enough Al called in 105 millimeter howitzer from the AC 130 in turn the thicket into a smoking crater months later when J.P. visited me at home I learned that the Alkai to commander had fled the house when he heard our birds coming at the start of the mission he left part of his personal security detail behind the fight a battle he had no stomach for himself and they died to the last man after inflicting three casualties on us months later another seal team ran the Alkai to commander to the ground and killed him justice served so that fire fight and again people should read the book to get the details of that fire fight but just reading about you wounded which I've covered that part and now you're up and running and get shot in the face and down everything guys think you're dead I don't think you could have I don't think a human being I don't think you could explain I don't think will Shakespeare could explain to someone that's not in the teams what it feels like to be in the teams and to feel like maybe that's not going to be your life anymore that's rough man and I don't think I mean you did your best and like I said I don't think it's just too to explain you know like I said if it'd been anybody else but my hatred for him had grown to the point that I was just like you know let me show you buddy you know I put 13 and I put in 13 and a half years I was a member of one of the most elite special operations units in modern history millions of dollars were spent preparing me training me out fitting me to handle the toughest battlefield tasks our nation can face and my own brothers have reduced me to this I stopped and thought about that statement where was the personal responsibility in it Vince Petersen's word came back to me you have an opportunity to learn here if you're willing to take it I served with good men whom I respected they turned their back on me or did they what did all this say about me a door suddenly opened in my mind the place it led to was a dark room that I had never entered inside I could see the truth about myself through the facade of lies I had built I stood at its threshold not really wanting to walk through Sunsu once said if you know your enemies and you know yourself you'll never be defeated I didn't know myself yeah maybe some some people maybe if someone like lost weight or something you know you use this game you were out these two eventually you were out of geese or you get a new one I was talking to Pete the other day the amount of geopants or geese period that have been returned is like so as said yeah we get like three geese back a year with some of the action warrants about they just don't wear out the warrants and geese just do not wear out so I said maybe I'm better off focusing on helping a whole bunch of people with this message and lending my support to another organization so myself and the board made the decision that we were going to phase down our organization in 2018 and 2019 made that shift that I'm totally focusing on delivering this content to help people overcome adversity to to launch themselves out of failure and to not only survive which some people just survive from these life ambushes from these massive catastrophic events but to thrive from them to use them as a launch point to get better and to understand how to do that and because I realize man you know this you've written all this amazing content on it and all that is coming into the second book that will come out December called over come
