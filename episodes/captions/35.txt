00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.80 This is Jocco podcast number 35 with echo Charles and me
00:00:06.60 --> 00:00:08.60 Jocco willing
00:00:08.60 --> 00:00:10.60 Good evening, I go good evening
00:00:14.48 --> 00:00:19.84 Weeper was ahead when he and born reach the gap in the wire
00:00:20.64 --> 00:00:26.76 Starshell after Starshell was going up now and the whole line had woken up machine guns were talking
00:00:26.76 --> 00:00:32.76 But there was one that would not talk the rattle of musketry continued
00:00:33.72 --> 00:00:37.24 But the mist was kindly to them and had thickened again
00:00:39.24 --> 00:00:45.000 As they got beyond the trampling clutching wire born saw weeper a couple of pieces ahead of him and
00:00:45.92 --> 00:00:50.92 What he thought was the last of their party disappearing into the mist about 20 yards away?
00:00:50.92 --> 00:00:58.88 He was glad to be clear of the wire another Starshell went up and they both froze and stillness under its glare
00:00:59.64 --> 00:01:02.52 Then they moved again hurrying for all they were worth
00:01:03.68 --> 00:01:07.56 Born felt the sense of triumph and escape thrill in him
00:01:08.68 --> 00:01:10.92 Anyway, the hunt couldn't see him now
00:01:13.28 --> 00:01:15.76 Something kicked him in the upper part of the chest
00:01:15.76 --> 00:01:26.04 Rending its way through him and his agonized cry was scarcely audible in the rush of blood from his mouth as he collapsed and fell
00:01:27.16 --> 00:01:31.24 Weeper turned his head over his shoulder listened stopped and went back
00:01:32.04 --> 00:01:37.98 He found born trying to lift himself and born spoke gasping suffocating
00:01:38.48 --> 00:01:40.48 Go on, I'm scuppered
00:01:40.48 --> 00:01:49.64 I'll not leave the said whipper said weeper. He stood and lifted the other and his huge ungangly arms
00:01:50.20 --> 00:01:53.32 carrying him as tenderly as though he were a child
00:01:54.28 --> 00:01:59.24 Born struggled weirdly to speak and the blood filling his mouth
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000 Prevented him
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.20 Sometimes his head fell on weeper's shoulder
00:02:05.20 --> 00:02:09.76 That last barely articulate a few words came
00:02:10.96 --> 00:02:15.12 I'm finished leave me in peace for God's sake. You can't
00:02:16.24 --> 00:02:18.24 I'll not leave thee
00:02:18.24 --> 00:02:20.24 said weeper in infuriate rage
00:02:22.24 --> 00:02:26.04 He felt born stretch himself in a convulsive shutter and
00:02:27.16 --> 00:02:31.08 Relax becoming suddenly heavier in his arms
00:02:31.08 --> 00:02:38.48 He struggled on stumbling over the shell plowed ground through that fantastic mist
00:02:38.76 --> 00:02:42.36 Which moved like an army of rates hurling away from him?
00:02:43.48 --> 00:02:48.60 Then he stopped and taking the body by the waist with his left arm flung it over his shoulder
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000 Steating it with his right
00:02:51.40 --> 00:02:56.40 He could see there wire now and presently he was challenged and replied
00:02:57.36 --> 00:02:59.36 He found the way through the wire
00:02:59.36 --> 00:03:03.36 And staggered into the trench with his burden
00:03:05.20 --> 00:03:07.20 Then he turned down the short stretch
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:16.08 to monk trench trench and came on the rest of the party outside a company's dugout
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.72 I've brought him back he cried desperately
00:03:20.72 --> 00:03:29.20 And collapsed with the body on the duckboards
00:03:31.20 --> 00:03:34.56 And that is from a book called
00:03:35.84 --> 00:03:37.84 The Middle Parts of Fortune
00:03:38.64 --> 00:03:42.32 Which is written by a guy named Frederick Manning
00:03:43.60 --> 00:03:47.60 who served with the kings
00:03:47.60 --> 00:03:54.32 Shropshire light infantry in World War I he served with the seventh battalion at the battle of the song
00:03:55.12 --> 00:04:02.88 And after the war he became a writer and the book which is actually a novel but based on his experiences
00:04:03.92 --> 00:04:09.36 Was published as being written by private one nine zero two two
00:04:10.64 --> 00:04:14.24 It's out of got originally published and then after his death
00:04:14.24 --> 00:04:19.60 He finally received credit for writing it and it's a
00:04:20.72 --> 00:04:28.32 It's a very powerful book and I wanted to start with that excerpt from World War I because it is the most shining
00:04:28.88 --> 00:04:33.92 In my mind and most horrific example of a Trishon warfare
00:04:34.40 --> 00:04:36.40 Almost 20 million killed
00:04:37.68 --> 00:04:40.64 Usually over a few hundred yards of trench
00:04:40.64 --> 00:04:44.64 And I can't stand that
00:04:45.92 --> 00:04:53.04 A Trishon warfare is a strategy in which one side tries to grind down and wear down the other side
00:04:54.56 --> 00:04:58.72 And they break when they no longer have the men
00:05:00.88 --> 00:05:02.88 The soldiers
00:05:03.44 --> 00:05:07.76 The people the humans or the supplies to keep it going
00:05:07.76 --> 00:05:09.76 In
00:05:09.76 --> 00:05:11.76 It's brutal
00:05:11.76 --> 00:05:13.76 And it also gives
00:05:13.76 --> 00:05:15.76 No real advantage
00:05:17.12 --> 00:05:23.20 To intellect and to thought and to tactical prowess on the battlefield
00:05:25.92 --> 00:05:27.92 And I don't like it
00:05:29.04 --> 00:05:31.04 Now the opposite
00:05:31.04 --> 00:05:33.36 Of a Trishon warfare is maneuver warfare
00:05:34.40 --> 00:05:36.64 And that's what we're gonna dive into tonight
00:05:36.64 --> 00:05:40.64 The book is the maneuver warfare handbook
00:05:42.48 --> 00:05:44.48 But as we
00:05:44.48 --> 00:05:46.48 Talk about it
00:05:46.48 --> 00:05:50.48 Think about it not just being about war and about combat
00:05:51.68 --> 00:05:56.80 But about how a Trishon warfare and maneuver warfare can be easily seen
00:05:57.84 --> 00:06:00.16 In the way that we lead you know and
00:06:00.16 --> 00:06:05.28 Also in the way we interact with other people with other humans which is what leading is
00:06:08.80 --> 00:06:10.80 And so here we go
00:06:10.80 --> 00:06:14.000 Into this book right here maneuver warfare handbook
00:06:15.52 --> 00:06:19.52 It's written by William S. Lind and we're getting him in a minute
00:06:22.16 --> 00:06:23.36 Here we go with the book
00:06:23.36 --> 00:06:26.72 I served over 31 years active duty with the Marine Corps
00:06:26.72 --> 00:06:33.44 Saw combat in both Korean Vietnam and attended service schools from the basic school to the National War College
00:06:34.32 --> 00:06:40.08 Yet only toward the end of my military career did I realize how little I really understood the art of war
00:06:41.12 --> 00:06:47.92 Even as a PFC in Korea after being met a vact along with most of my platoon after a fruitless frontal assault
00:06:47.92 --> 00:06:50.32 Against superior North Korean forces
00:06:50.32 --> 00:06:53.84 It seemed to me there had to be a better way to wage war
00:06:53.84 --> 00:06:55.84 17 years later
00:06:56.64 --> 00:06:58.64 Commanding a battalion at K-Son
00:06:59.36 --> 00:07:05.04 I was resolved that none of my Marines would die for lack of superior combat power
00:07:06.32 --> 00:07:11.36 But we were still relying on the concentration of superior firepower to win
00:07:11.92 --> 00:07:15.28 Essentially still practicing grants at Trishon warfare
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.96 And we were still doing frontal assaults
00:07:20.64 --> 00:07:22.64 That opening right there is
00:07:22.64 --> 00:07:24.64 Colonel John C. Stutt
00:07:26.48 --> 00:07:30.32 Marine Corps obviously and he just kind of explained his his
00:07:31.44 --> 00:07:33.44 his career path
00:07:33.44 --> 00:07:40.16 Servant in both Korean Vietnam and he goes on the author of this book so he's doing the forward to this book maneuver warfare
00:07:40.16 --> 00:07:44.48 The author of this book has never served a day of active military duty
00:07:45.68 --> 00:07:47.68 And he has never been shot at
00:07:47.68 --> 00:07:53.76 Although there are no doubt some senior officers would like to remedy that later ladder deficiency
00:07:53.76 --> 00:07:58.96 So he's a little bit unpopular the guy that wrote this book with some with some people
00:07:59.44 --> 00:08:03.28 Yet he demonstrates an amazing understanding of the art of war
00:08:04.16 --> 00:08:09.12 As have only a small handful of military thinkers. I have come across in my career
00:08:09.52 --> 00:08:11.52 So he's talking about this guy
00:08:11.52 --> 00:08:14.32 William William S. Linde
00:08:14.32 --> 00:08:22.40 And here he goes into some details on William S. Linde and how he came into contact with him
00:08:23.12 --> 00:08:25.12 Back to the book
00:08:25.52 --> 00:08:33.12 When I first heard Bill Lynn speak I must confess I resented a mere civilian expressing criticism of the way our beloved
00:08:33.12 --> 00:08:34.16 Core did things
00:08:34.88 --> 00:08:37.12 After all he was not one of us
00:08:37.76 --> 00:08:41.04 He had not shed blood with us in battle. He was not a brother
00:08:41.04 --> 00:08:47.28 And I had strong suspicions that he would have difficulty passing the PFT
00:08:47.92 --> 00:08:53.84 Meaning the physical test the physical this so this guy went a lind not not exactly a
00:08:54.56 --> 00:08:56.56 High level athlete
00:08:57.20 --> 00:09:03.52 But what he said made sense for the first time I was personally hearing someone advocate a new
00:09:03.52 --> 00:09:09.04 Unapproach to war that was based on intellectual innovation rather than sheer material superiority
00:09:09.04 --> 00:09:13.36 Mission type orders surfaces and gaps shfared punked
00:09:14.16 --> 00:09:19.12 Instead of the rigid formulas and checklist that we normally associate with our training and doctrine
00:09:19.60 --> 00:09:21.60 It was a stimulating experience
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.32 Through Lynn's articulation years of my own reading of military history began to make a lot more sense
00:09:30.16 --> 00:09:33.28 But why all this from a civilian instead of a professional soldier?
00:09:33.28 --> 00:09:41.44 In fact the entire movement for for military reform is driven largely by civilian intellectuals not military officers
00:09:41.76 --> 00:09:45.60 One notable exception being retired air force Colonel John Boyd
00:09:46.72 --> 00:09:48.96 When you think about it, this is not surprising
00:09:49.60 --> 00:09:51.60 We have never institutionalized
00:09:52.16 --> 00:09:57.68 A system that encourages innovative ideas or criticism from subordinates. So there you go
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.76 It's the military. What do you say to your what do you say to your superior officer?
00:10:01.76 --> 00:10:05.60 I don't think that's a good plan. No, what they're told to do is support the plan
00:10:07.76 --> 00:10:15.04 Proposing significant change is viewed frequently viewed as criticism of superiors since they're responsible for the way things are
00:10:15.52 --> 00:10:18.80 And borders on disloyalty if not in subordination
00:10:20.08 --> 00:10:24.96 So it's not surprising that the movement for reform comes from outside the military establishment
00:10:24.96 --> 00:10:29.76 And he goes on to say be age
00:10:30.16 --> 00:10:34.16 Lidale Hart which be age Lidale Hart was a guy that
00:10:35.60 --> 00:10:38.000 Fought in world war one a Brit the front world war one
00:10:39.36 --> 00:10:42.96 Battle of Somme he got hit three times
00:10:44.24 --> 00:10:45.68 Eventually was gasped
00:10:46.32 --> 00:10:50.72 Set out of line and almost his entire battalion was wiped out
00:10:50.72 --> 00:10:57.28 And this guy eventually wrote a book called strategy and indirect approach
00:10:59.52 --> 00:11:02.24 And an interesting I pulled up one quote from him
00:11:03.84 --> 00:11:07.84 Often the longest way around is the shortest way there
00:11:08.40 --> 00:11:10.40 This is the indirect approach
00:11:10.80 --> 00:11:14.24 So anyways back to the book here on what be age Lidale Hart said
00:11:14.24 --> 00:11:22.72 Bill Hart once remarked that the only thing harder than getting a new idea into the military mind is to get an old one out
00:11:23.68 --> 00:11:27.20 In 1925 when he was expounding such a terrible
00:11:28.08 --> 00:11:30.40 theories as the indirect approach
00:11:31.12 --> 00:11:38.80 The American General Service Schools review of current military literature dismissed one of Lidale Hart's major works as
00:11:38.80 --> 00:11:43.36 Negative value to the instructors at these schools
00:11:44.72 --> 00:11:49.20 I expect Marine Corps schools to receive this publication with similar enthusiasm
00:11:49.68 --> 00:11:53.68 But I cannot believe a professional military officer would not benefit by reading it
00:11:56.80 --> 00:11:58.32 So
00:11:58.32 --> 00:12:00.32 That's if you
00:12:00.32 --> 00:12:06.80 To catch the set up of this book he's saying look this is different what we've been taught this is different and by the way this this book
00:12:06.80 --> 00:12:10.000 I'm checking the dates right now this came out in 1985
00:12:10.80 --> 00:12:11.84 So
00:12:11.84 --> 00:12:16.64 There has been progress in this direction since then but at the time that this came out it was just
00:12:17.84 --> 00:12:20.56 It was viewed as almost
00:12:21.04 --> 00:12:23.04 In subordination to think this way
00:12:26.16 --> 00:12:28.16 So let's jump into it right here
00:12:28.16 --> 00:12:41.68 With the theory of maneuver warfare so now we're getting to lend himself writing maneuver warfare is not new
00:12:42.40 --> 00:12:48.40 It probably dates from the first time a caveman surprised an enemy from behind instead of meeting him club to club
00:12:50.72 --> 00:12:55.04 Sometimes the word maneuver is used as a synonym for movement
00:12:55.04 --> 00:13:00.64 Such such as in references to fire and maneuver in small unit tactics
00:13:00.88 --> 00:13:06.56 So that's you know we have in in the book extreme ownership cover move and and that's what we're talking about
00:13:06.56 --> 00:13:11.28 We're talking about move. He's saying fire maneuver is the same use of the word maneuver to mean move
00:13:14.16 --> 00:13:19.68 Manuver is organized movement of troops during combat operations to a new access and
00:13:19.68 --> 00:13:27.20 Region for the purpose of taking in an advantageous position relative to the enemy in order to deliver a decisive strike
00:13:28.16 --> 00:13:30.80 So that that's sort of the classical definition
00:13:31.68 --> 00:13:34.40 But when used in the phrase maneuver warfare
00:13:35.12 --> 00:13:37.12 maneuver means much more
00:13:37.92 --> 00:13:43.84 Only recently has someone suggested a convincing answer of what maneuver means
00:13:43.84 --> 00:13:48.72 That man is a retired air force colonel and fighter pilot named John Boyd
00:13:49.44 --> 00:13:54.24 Colonel Boyd's development of the theory of maneuver warfare began not with ground battles
00:13:54.96 --> 00:13:59.04 But with a study of some mock air to air combat exercises
00:13:59.60 --> 00:14:05.92 Conducted at Nella's air force base in 1974 that led him back to the study of air to air combat during the Korean war
00:14:06.88 --> 00:14:12.96 American aviators were very successful in that conflict they achieved a 10 to one kill ratio
00:14:12.96 --> 00:14:21.44 Over their North Korean and Chinese opponents Colonel Boyd began his study with the question how and why did we do so well?
00:14:23.28 --> 00:14:29.36 He noted in several tradition he noted that in several traditional measures of aircraft performance
00:14:29.92 --> 00:14:35.76 The principal communist fighter the Meg 15 was superior to the American F86
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.60 So you might think oh Americans always have the best technology not true
00:14:39.60 --> 00:14:43.92 So and and Boyd will end up doing boyd we're gonna hear quite a bit about him right now
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.44 But this guy was sort of a strategic genius in the air force and a bunch of people on Twitter
00:14:49.84 --> 00:14:53.12 Hit me and social media have always been saying you got to do boy. You got to do boy
00:14:53.12 --> 00:14:56.96 And I know I got to do boy to some point and this is sort of a good introduction to boyd
00:14:57.52 --> 00:14:58.80 So
00:14:58.80 --> 00:15:04.56 Here's the here's the difference between the Meg 15 and the American F86
00:15:04.56 --> 00:15:10.08 The Meg 15 it could climb and accelerate faster and it had better sustain turn rate
00:15:10.72 --> 00:15:17.04 But in two less obvious measures of aircraft performance the F86 was much superior to the Meg
00:15:17.60 --> 00:15:25.92 First the pilot could see out much better the F86 bubble canopy gave its pilot very good outward vision
00:15:26.48 --> 00:15:30.40 While the Meg's faired faired canopy made it difficult to see out
00:15:30.40 --> 00:15:38.40 Second the F86 had a high powered and highly effective hydraulic controls and the Meg did not
00:15:39.04 --> 00:15:43.68 This meant that while the Meg could do many individual actions
00:15:44.24 --> 00:15:54.48 Including turn climb and accelerate better than the F86 the F86 could transition from one action to another much more quickly than the Meg
00:15:55.76 --> 00:15:57.76 It was better in the transition
00:15:57.76 --> 00:16:04.24 So for all you did it super players we start that scramble you start that scramble the the F86 is a better scramble
00:16:06.24 --> 00:16:14.24 Using these two superior to use the American pilots developed a tactical approach that forced the Meg into a series of actions each
00:16:15.04 --> 00:16:24.32 Each time the action changed the F86 gained a time advantage because the F86 pilot could see more quickly how the situation had changed
00:16:24.32 --> 00:16:29.04 And he could also make his aircraft shift more quickly to a new action
00:16:29.52 --> 00:16:36.000 So he can see what's happening faster than once he sees it which he saw faster now he can make his adjustment faster
00:16:37.04 --> 00:16:40.88 With each change the Meg's actions became more
00:16:41.60 --> 00:16:47.44 inappropriate until they were so inappropriate that the Meg gave the F86 a good firing opportunity
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.68 Often it appeared the Meg pilot realized what was happening to him in panic
00:16:51.68 --> 00:16:54.80 Which made the American pilots job all the easier
00:16:56.96 --> 00:17:02.000 Later Colonel Boyd began studying ground combat to see if there were any situation similar to that
00:17:02.40 --> 00:17:04.88 He had found in the air war over Korea
00:17:05.20 --> 00:17:10.64 He found that in battles campaigns in wars like Vixberg and France a
00:17:11.28 --> 00:17:13.28 Similar thing seemed to have happened
00:17:13.28 --> 00:17:23.28 One side had presented the other with a sudden unexpected change or a series of such changes to which it could not adjust in a timely manner as a result
00:17:23.28 --> 00:17:28.000 It was defeated and it was generally defeated at small costs as a divector
00:17:28.96 --> 00:17:36.40 Often the losing side had been physically stronger than the winner just like the Meg 15 was was physically faster
00:17:37.60 --> 00:17:39.60 It didn't matter
00:17:39.60 --> 00:17:48.72 And often the same sort of panic and paralysis the North Korean and Chinese pilots had shown seemed to occur
00:17:49.60 --> 00:17:53.60 Colonel Boyd asked himself what did all these cases have in common?
00:17:54.24 --> 00:17:58.000 His answer was what is now called the Boyd theory
00:17:58.64 --> 00:18:01.04 Which is the theory of maneuver warfare
00:18:02.16 --> 00:18:08.16 The briefing Colonel Boyd gives to explain his theory patterns of conflict takes over five hours
00:18:08.16 --> 00:18:14.72 So he's so the so Colonel Boyd does give this brief and it takes over five hours or he did when he was when he was alive
00:18:15.28 --> 00:18:21.12 But at the cost of missing some of the subtleties and supporting historical evidence in the briefing it can be summarized as follows
00:18:21.12 --> 00:18:25.12 So here's a kind of a synopsis of the Boyd theory that
00:18:26.08 --> 00:18:28.08 Lin is gonna put together for us right now
00:18:29.36 --> 00:18:31.36 Back to the book
00:18:31.36 --> 00:18:38.96 Conflict can be seen as time competitive observation orientation decision action cycles
00:18:39.92 --> 00:18:43.12 Each party to a conflict begins by observing
00:18:43.36 --> 00:18:46.64 He observes himself his physical surroundings and his enemy
00:18:47.04 --> 00:18:54.64 On the basis of his observatory observation he oryons that is to say he makes a mental image or snapshot of his situation
00:18:55.20 --> 00:18:58.40 On the basis of this orientation he makes a decision
00:18:58.40 --> 00:19:02.08 He puts the decision into effect i.e. he acts
00:19:02.88 --> 00:19:06.64 Then because he assumes his action has changed the situation
00:19:06.88 --> 00:19:11.92 He observes again and starts the process a new his actions follow a cycle
00:19:12.40 --> 00:19:20.56 Sometimes called the Boyd cycle or Ud aloup and Ud is O O DA and that's observed oriented side and act
00:19:20.56 --> 00:19:30.48 If one side in a conflict can consistently go through the Boyd cycle faster than the other it gains a tremendous event advantage
00:19:31.04 --> 00:19:39.68 By the time the slower side acts the faster side is doing something different from what he observed and his action is inappropriate
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.52 With each cycle the slower parties action is inappropriately
00:19:44.48 --> 00:19:46.88 Is inappropriate by a larger time margin
00:19:46.88 --> 00:19:52.96 Even though he desperately strives to do something that will work each action is less useful than its predecessor
00:19:52.96 --> 00:19:55.20 He falls further and further behind
00:19:55.92 --> 00:19:57.92 Ultimately he ceases to be effective
00:19:59.04 --> 00:20:04.08 And he we clearly I mean that this is obvious in combat. It's also obvious in in jujitsu
00:20:04.08 --> 00:20:07.12 I mean very clear when you're training when you're wrong with somebody
00:20:07.12 --> 00:20:15.84 If if they're not making adjustments fast enough you just it's two or three two or three transitions and you got them you're on their back. You know
00:20:18.80 --> 00:20:24.64 The Boyd Fury defines what is meant by the word maneuver in the term maneuver warfare
00:20:25.04 --> 00:20:26.80 Manuver means Boyd cycling
00:20:27.28 --> 00:20:35.20 Boyd cycling the enemy being consistently faster through however many Ud aloups it takes until the enemy loses its cohesion until he can no longer fight
00:20:35.20 --> 00:20:37.20 Isn't effective organized force
00:20:38.08 --> 00:20:41.52 Sometimes a Boyd cycle the enemy panics or becomes passive
00:20:41.92 --> 00:20:50.88 This is an ideal outcome for the victor because a panicked passive enemy can be annihilated or captured at the lowest cost in friendly casualties
00:20:51.60 --> 00:20:56.80 At other times the outmaneuvered enemy may continue to fight as individuals or small units
00:20:56.80 --> 00:21:06.56 But because he can no longer act effectively as a force he is comparatively easy to destroy so
00:21:07.60 --> 00:21:13.52 Continuing on if the object in maneuver warfare is to move through the Ud aloups faster than the enemy
00:21:13.92 --> 00:21:15.28 What do you need to do?
00:21:15.68 --> 00:21:17.68 How can you be consistently faster?
00:21:18.56 --> 00:21:22.96 Much of the much of the rest of this book is an effort to address that question
00:21:22.96 --> 00:21:28.000 But in terms of general theory the following points are worth thinking about
00:21:28.72 --> 00:21:29.92 one
00:21:29.92 --> 00:21:33.92 Only a decentralized military can have a fast-oot aloup
00:21:35.28 --> 00:21:43.28 If the observations must be passed up the chain of command the orientation made in the decision taken at a high level and the command for action
00:21:43.28 --> 00:21:47.84 Then transmitted back down the chain the Ud aloup is going to be slow
00:21:47.84 --> 00:21:57.52 As the Israeli military historian Martin van Crevel has observed from Plato to NATO
00:21:58.08 --> 00:22:02.96 The history of command and war consists of an endless quest for certainty
00:22:04.88 --> 00:22:10.96 Certainty concerning the state and intention of the enemy's forces certain de-concerning the manifold factors
00:22:10.96 --> 00:22:18.56 Which together constitute the environment from the weather and the terrain to the radioactivity and presence of chemical warfare agents and
00:22:19.20 --> 00:22:21.20 Last but definitely not least
00:22:21.20 --> 00:22:25.20 Certainty concerning the state and activities of one's own forces
00:22:25.92 --> 00:22:32.32 Historical commanders have always faced the choice between two basic ways of coping with uncertainty
00:22:33.28 --> 00:22:38.16 One was to construct an army of automatons following the orders of a single man
00:22:38.16 --> 00:22:41.84 Allowed to do only that which could be controlled
00:22:43.04 --> 00:22:55.76 That's centralized command the other to design organizations and operations in such a way as to enable the former to carry out the latter without the need for continuous control
00:22:56.64 --> 00:23:01.04 This second the second of these methods has that's decentralized command
00:23:01.44 --> 00:23:06.88 The second of these methods has to buy and large proved more successful than the first and
00:23:06.88 --> 00:23:17.76 The ongoing revolution in the technology of command notwithstanding this is likely to remain so in the future and indeed so long as war itself exists
00:23:20.72 --> 00:23:24.48 Very obvious stuff and again, you know in in our book
00:23:25.44 --> 00:23:33.44 Stream ownership. That's one of the principles of combat decentralized command and this is what it is if you don't have decentralized command
00:23:33.44 --> 00:23:39.76 That you have to report up the chain of command that takes time by the time it gets back down
00:23:40.08 --> 00:23:44.16 What the decision decision gets made at the higher level than they pass it back down to you
00:23:45.76 --> 00:23:51.28 By the time it gets to you it's already changed and that's in a jiu-jitsu in a jitsu
00:23:52.40 --> 00:23:59.52 comparison if you if you if you have to think about your moves, so you have instinct to lose muscle memory when somebody
00:23:59.52 --> 00:24:04.80 Starts the pass your guard you get the underlock if you have to think about getting the underhook
00:24:04.80 --> 00:24:11.44 And you have to command your body to get the underhook there. You got the underhook on you. Yeah, so it's the same thing here. That's the dead's decentralized command
00:24:13.52 --> 00:24:20.16 Back to the book number two maneuver warfare means you will not only accept confusion and disorder and
00:24:20.48 --> 00:24:24.80 Operate successfully within it through decentralization you will also
00:24:24.80 --> 00:24:32.40 Generate confusion and disorder. I love that that's just awesome right? It's not just saying hey look things great confusing
00:24:32.88 --> 00:24:37.44 But I'm actually going to create the confusion. I'm going to make it happen that's something any
00:24:37.44 --> 00:24:40.96 When you see the really good jiu-jitsu guys, I mean Glover does that Glover creates confusion
00:24:40.96 --> 00:24:47.04 He creates mayhem he creates chaos and the gate in the in a match. He wants the scrambled to happen. He wants to go as long as possible
00:24:47.04 --> 00:24:56.64 The reconnaissance pull tactics of the German blitzkrieg were inherently disorderly now this is something that's very
00:24:56.80 --> 00:25:00.56 Contrary to what people think of of the German military and even the German culture
00:25:01.44 --> 00:25:07.12 German culture is very orderly and here we say the the blitzkrieg was inherently disorderly
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.04 Back to the book higher headquarters could neither direct nor predict the exact path of the advance
00:25:13.04 --> 00:25:20.000 But the multitude of German reconnaissance thrust generated massive confusion among the French in 1940
00:25:20.48 --> 00:25:30.64 Each was reported as a new attack the German seemed to be everywhere and the French who system demanded certainty before making any decisions were paralyzed
00:25:32.64 --> 00:25:36.08 It's it's very interesting to think about that idea of
00:25:36.08 --> 00:25:47.52 We all want to have certainty and what's going to happen and how in in battle and in life if you wait until you're 100% certain you're probably going to be too late
00:25:51.20 --> 00:25:57.60 Speaking of certainty three all patterns recipes and formulas are to be avoided
00:25:58.32 --> 00:26:04.16 The enemy must not be able to predict your actions if your tactics follow predictable patterns
00:26:04.16 --> 00:26:11.04 The enemy can easily cut inside your utaloupe if you can predict what you will do you will be waiting for you
00:26:12.32 --> 00:26:16.80 This is why it's so hard to tell someone how to do maneuver warfare
00:26:17.84 --> 00:26:21.28 There is no formula you can learn when someone says
00:26:22.40 --> 00:26:26.24 Cut all the bull about theory just tell me what to do you can't
00:26:27.76 --> 00:26:31.36 You can talk about how to think and about some useful techniques
00:26:31.36 --> 00:26:36.24 But you can't give new formulas to replace the ones currently taught
00:26:37.28 --> 00:26:39.44 Instead of a checklist or a cookbook
00:26:39.84 --> 00:26:44.24 maneuver warfare requires commanders who can sense more than they can see
00:26:44.96 --> 00:26:52.40 Who understand the opponent's strengths and weaknesses and their own and who can find the enemies critical weaknesses in a specific situation
00:26:53.20 --> 00:26:58.80 They must be able to create multiple threats and keep the enemy uncertain as to which one is real
00:26:58.80 --> 00:27:03.36 They must be able to see their options in the situation before them
00:27:04.24 --> 00:27:10.40 Constantly create new options and shift rapidly among options as the situation develops
00:27:12.16 --> 00:27:17.52 General Herman bulk one of the most successful practitioners of maneuver warfare said
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.12 I'm against the school approach that says in accordance with the ideas of the general staff in this situation
00:27:23.12 --> 00:27:25.12 You must do thus and such
00:27:25.12 --> 00:27:34.80 On the contrary you must proceed as dictated by the personalities involved and the particulars of the situation
00:27:35.68 --> 00:27:41.84 So he got a German successful German general and he's actually saying you react based
00:27:42.40 --> 00:27:47.04 Not just on the situation of the of the on the ground but on the personalities involved
00:27:47.04 --> 00:27:51.68 Leadership is an art my friend
00:27:56.24 --> 00:28:01.76 Therefore one of the first principles has to be there can be no fixed schemes
00:28:02.48 --> 00:28:05.20 Every scheme every pattern is wrong
00:28:06.16 --> 00:28:12.16 No two situations are identical that is why the study of military history can be extremely dangerous
00:28:12.16 --> 00:28:18.56 Another principle that follows from is from this is never do the same thing twice
00:28:19.12 --> 00:28:23.28 Even if something works well for you once by the second time the enemy will have adapted
00:28:23.92 --> 00:28:25.92 So you have to think of something new
00:28:27.28 --> 00:28:32.16 No one thinks of becoming a great painter simply by imitating Michelangelo
00:28:33.20 --> 00:28:38.72 Similarly you can't become a great military leader just by imitating someone
00:28:38.72 --> 00:28:45.04 It has to come from within in the last analysis military command is an art
00:28:46.32 --> 00:28:49.44 One man can do it and most will never learn
00:28:53.28 --> 00:28:55.28 Little bit of maneuver warfare and
00:28:57.52 --> 00:29:05.28 So so at the the way the book is broken up this book is called maneuver warfare handbook it's it goes into
00:29:05.28 --> 00:29:07.28 to
00:29:07.76 --> 00:29:09.76 breaks into another
00:29:09.76 --> 00:29:11.76 section which we're gonna get to in a minute
00:29:12.48 --> 00:29:18.64 But he kind of goes into a little bit will end go now goes into a little bit talking about education and training
00:29:20.96 --> 00:29:26.08 Back to the book it is my great and this is a quote it is my great and constant hope
00:29:26.64 --> 00:29:34.40 That the Marine Coral will produce some outstanding man for this country such man are somewhere and they may as well be in our classes
00:29:34.40 --> 00:29:41.12 Is anywhere else? I do not want such a person to be hammered down by narrowness and dogmas
00:29:42.40 --> 00:29:46.16 to have his mind cramped by compulsory details
00:29:46.88 --> 00:29:52.24 It is my constant ambition to see the Marine officers filled with ambition
00:29:52.96 --> 00:29:59.52 Initiative and originality and they can get these attributes only by liberal
00:29:59.52 --> 00:30:10.24 Liberality of thought broad thought that differs thought that differs from precedent and the compulsory imprint of others
00:30:11.84 --> 00:30:13.84 And that is a long paragraph
00:30:14.40 --> 00:30:16.40 That says free your mind
00:30:17.76 --> 00:30:21.84 Free your mind and I love pointing us out because this is the Marine Corps
00:30:22.72 --> 00:30:27.92 That's that that quote is from the common dawn of Marine Corps schools Brigadier general
00:30:27.92 --> 00:30:32.000 J.C. Breckenridge written in 1934 in
00:30:32.88 --> 00:30:37.20 1934 he was saying people Marine Corps officers
00:30:38.08 --> 00:30:40.08 Don't go by the book
00:30:40.32 --> 00:30:44.32 Don't obey what other people said he wants him filled with ambition. That's pretty normal
00:30:44.64 --> 00:30:46.64 But initiative and originality
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.80 He's telling in order to be a good leader
00:30:52.48 --> 00:30:54.48 You got to free your mind
00:30:54.48 --> 00:30:59.92 Now like I said the book makes a transition from being the
00:31:02.08 --> 00:31:04.72 From being the introduction
00:31:05.36 --> 00:31:11.20 by William Lind about maneuver warfare and then it slides into another section
00:31:11.92 --> 00:31:18.80 Which is just about as big and this this part is called fundamentals of tactics and this section is
00:31:18.80 --> 00:31:25.76 Written by Colonel Michael D. Wiley United says Marine Corps and he ran a course
00:31:26.96 --> 00:31:30.000 Fundamentals of tactics course and this is
00:31:30.80 --> 00:31:36.72 Sort of the this is the this is the notes from the course when he would teach this course the fundamentals of tactics and a Colonel Wiley
00:31:36.96 --> 00:31:38.96 Kind of interesting he went to the
00:31:38.96 --> 00:31:43.68 Went to the using elisted marine then he went to the naval academy and he was
00:31:44.32 --> 00:31:46.32 Jim webs
00:31:46.32 --> 00:31:51.76 Company commander in Vietnam Vietnam and and Jim web is a fairly
00:31:52.48 --> 00:31:59.12 Famous guy he was a navy cross winner. He is a set now a he was a senator from Virginia
00:32:00.80 --> 00:32:02.80 He wrote a book called
00:32:03.12 --> 00:32:07.36 Fields of fire and then there's another great book called
00:32:08.24 --> 00:32:12.08 The Night and Gale song which is he follows a couple
00:32:12.96 --> 00:32:14.96 five
00:32:14.96 --> 00:32:19.68 So yeah, I think it's it's a web McCain all over north
00:32:22.24 --> 00:32:26.48 Macphorland I think and and John point actually anyways very prominent
00:32:27.12 --> 00:32:33.68 Graduates from the naval academy that all kind of stood out and were were connected
00:32:33.92 --> 00:32:42.80 Throughout the book so this guy so Jim web is this is this kind of famous guy and this guy that wrote this was was Jim web's company commander in Vietnam
00:32:42.80 --> 00:32:44.80 So that's
00:32:45.20 --> 00:32:49.12 Kind of it's a small world things tie together
00:32:49.68 --> 00:32:54.80 So now we get into these lectures that you wrote and I don't mean the lecture anybody but
00:32:55.60 --> 00:32:59.84 Hey, they're called lectures in this book. I would just call them free-frow information
00:32:59.84 --> 00:33:05.12 We're gonna learn from in the first the first section is called surfaces and gaps
00:33:05.12 --> 00:33:13.20 The concept of surfaces and gaps is one of several concepts that bear on tactics
00:33:13.84 --> 00:33:21.68 It is unimportant whether you refer to this concept as surfaces and gaps or soft spot tactics or simply the idea of
00:33:21.84 --> 00:33:24.72 Pitting your strength against the enemies weaknesses
00:33:26.32 --> 00:33:31.68 That is what it is all about strength against weakness call it what you will the term
00:33:31.68 --> 00:33:38.16 Surfaces and gaps is derived from a German term flaking on the lukin tactic
00:33:39.20 --> 00:33:46.000 Which means simply the tactics of surfaces and gaps the surfaces being the enemy strong points
00:33:46.24 --> 00:33:50.32 Which we avoid the gaps being the weak points that we want to go through
00:33:52.16 --> 00:33:54.56 Now La Delle Hart if we talked about already today
00:33:54.56 --> 00:34:06.24 Called it the expanding torrent system tactic he drew an analogy between attacking an attacking army and a torrent of water
00:34:07.28 --> 00:34:12.48 If we watch a torrent bearing down on each successive bank of earth and damn in its path
00:34:12.48 --> 00:34:17.44 We see that it first beats against the obstacle feeling and testing it on all points
00:34:18.16 --> 00:34:20.48 Eventually it falls it finds a small crack
00:34:20.48 --> 00:34:29.92 Through this crack pour the first driplets of water and rush straight on the pent-up water on each side is drawn towards the breach
00:34:30.16 --> 00:34:36.96 It swirls through around the flanks of the breach wearing away the earth on each side and so widening the gap
00:34:37.36 --> 00:34:44.24 Simultaneously the water behind poor straight through that breach between this the side eti's which are wearing away the flanks
00:34:44.72 --> 00:34:48.40 Directly it is passed through it expands to widen once more
00:34:48.40 --> 00:34:51.68 The on-reach of the turn of the torrent
00:34:52.56 --> 00:34:59.92 Thus as the water pours through it in and an ever increasing volume the on-reach of the torrent swells to its original proportion
00:35:00.40 --> 00:35:03.28 Leaving in turn each crumbling obstacle behind it
00:35:05.92 --> 00:35:07.92 Long paragraph
00:35:08.24 --> 00:35:12.96 But that's how water gets through things finds the weak point and piles on
00:35:12.96 --> 00:35:21.52 The idea of putting surfaces and gaps tactics into practice was first implemented by the German army in world war one
00:35:22.16 --> 00:35:28.16 This is stuff that everybody should know especially military people in 1918 as they prepared for
00:35:28.16 --> 00:35:32.64 Ludendorf spring offensive the German army changed its offensive tactics
00:35:33.12 --> 00:35:38.80 The Germans had found that they were being overpowered by the material available to the British and the French
00:35:38.80 --> 00:35:44.56 The Americans were coming and it was clear that Germany was going to lose if she did not do something differently
00:35:45.12 --> 00:35:52.88 Because they did not have the option of matching the allies strength and material the Germans decided that they would have to outthink them
00:35:53.68 --> 00:35:56.48 That is they would have to have better tactics
00:35:57.76 --> 00:36:02.96 Germany did not succeed in winning the war it was too late by this time they were surrounded
00:36:03.36 --> 00:36:07.76 The women and children were starving at home. It was simply too late for them to win
00:36:07.76 --> 00:36:10.64 Yet they made some tactical progress
00:36:11.36 --> 00:36:15.68 There at the last at last in the spring of 1918
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.12 They inflicted terrible defeats on their enemies to the point that the allied armies were seriously
00:36:21.12 --> 00:36:23.12 Considering the prospect of giving up
00:36:24.08 --> 00:36:27.92 At the tactical level the Germans put their strength against weakness
00:36:28.56 --> 00:36:30.56 They sought the gaps
00:36:30.56 --> 00:36:36.32 Small assault groups called storm groupin sought gaps in the enemy lines and attacked through them
00:36:36.32 --> 00:36:41.12 Assaulting with light machine guns rifles grenades and flame throwers while heavy machine guns
00:36:41.36 --> 00:36:46.40 Direct and indirect weapons including trench mortars were used to suppress enemy strong points
00:36:47.76 --> 00:36:53.20 But on a strategic level the spring of 1918 offensive failed
00:36:53.84 --> 00:36:59.52 Why because looting duff on that level put strength against strength?
00:36:59.52 --> 00:37:07.12 He was seeking gaps he was seeking gaps at the enemy strong points. That's a very
00:37:07.68 --> 00:37:12.32 Great information to have so yeah the guys on the ground were attacking the weak points
00:37:12.32 --> 00:37:16.88 But the strategic picture they were still attacking a strong area
00:37:17.28 --> 00:37:21.20 So you might have found a little weakness in a wall a little weakness in the wire a little weakness in the trench
00:37:21.36 --> 00:37:26.48 But they were attacking a let's say at 20 mile trench that was overall was a strong area
00:37:26.48 --> 00:37:29.84 Whereas they should have looked for where the flanks are a hundred miles away
00:37:32.72 --> 00:37:39.20 Back to the book the idea of putting strength against weakness was of course born way before 1918
00:37:39.76 --> 00:37:45.68 Clouse fits rights about it in chapter nine and ten of book seven in chapter nine
00:37:45.92 --> 00:37:48.40 Regarding defense of positions he states
00:37:48.88 --> 00:37:55.28 The attack cannot prevail against them it has no means at its disposal to counteract their advantage
00:37:55.28 --> 00:38:03.28 In practice not all defensive positions are like this if the attacker sees that he can get away without assaulting them
00:38:03.36 --> 00:38:07.92 It would be stupid of him not to attempt it. It would be super to him to attempt it
00:38:08.24 --> 00:38:12.40 It is a risky business to attack an able opponent in a good position
00:38:13.12 --> 00:38:18.96 Same thing we heard from Sunsu you don't attack never heavily defended positions
00:38:18.96 --> 00:38:28.72 Back to the book employment of this concept of surfaces and gaps then gives us many advantages over what could be called
00:38:28.80 --> 00:38:32.80 slower moving forms of combat where strength is thrown against strength
00:38:33.68 --> 00:38:38.64 Attacking through gaps avoiding surfaces gives us an advantage of economy of force
00:38:39.52 --> 00:38:43.20 If we are pitted strength against strength assaulting enemy strong points
00:38:43.36 --> 00:38:47.92 We are consuming our manpower as well as ammunition to supplies as we go along
00:38:47.92 --> 00:38:49.92 If we go through the gaps
00:38:50.40 --> 00:38:52.40 We are practicing economy of force
00:38:52.80 --> 00:38:55.76 We are reaching our objective without using up our men
00:38:55.92 --> 00:39:02.16 We are leaving the enemy behind because we are moving faster we have the advantage of rapid exploitation
00:39:03.20 --> 00:39:05.44 So when you attack obviously attack weaknesses
00:39:06.24 --> 00:39:08.24 You lose less be lose less men
00:39:08.24 --> 00:39:17.84 Now this is important the concept of surfaces and gaps demands leadership from the front as opposed to leadership from the rear
00:39:18.56 --> 00:39:21.44 The commander must be where he can make swift decisions
00:39:21.84 --> 00:39:24.24 He must be where the situation is developing
00:39:24.96 --> 00:39:30.000 Obviously leadership from the front had become a scarcity in world war one
00:39:30.64 --> 00:39:33.44 JFC follower in his book general ship wrote
00:39:33.44 --> 00:39:39.04 In the world war nothing was more dreadful to witness than a chain of men
00:39:39.52 --> 00:39:49.36 Starting with a batying commander and ending with an army commander sitting in telephone boxes improvised or actual talking talking
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000 In place of leading leading
00:39:52.48 --> 00:39:53.52 leading
00:39:53.52 --> 00:39:58.24 The result was unresponsive leadership and slow reactions
00:39:58.24 --> 00:40:06.48 We talked about this on the last podcast when life was talking about being in an assault force and being in the assault train
00:40:06.64 --> 00:40:13.92 Which is 20 guys 15 or 20 guys and he was standing always at the end of the train because that's where you was told he was supposed to be
00:40:14.32 --> 00:40:20.24 And he didn't know what's going on the front so he couldn't help he couldn't make any decisions if someone was gonna if he needed to make a decision
00:40:20.96 --> 00:40:23.12 Well, he couldn't even make a decision because he knows what's going on up there
00:40:23.12 --> 00:40:30.40 But if someone said hey, we need a decision from the boss they had to pass that word all the way back. No, not good
00:40:31.92 --> 00:40:35.20 So you got to lead from the front with decentralized command and
00:40:36.40 --> 00:40:40.88 Be far enough the final one. I don't want to make it sound that simple you got to be it's the same thing we talked about life
00:40:40.88 --> 00:40:43.12 You got to be far enough forward that you can
00:40:44.24 --> 00:40:45.92 Understand what's happening up there and
00:40:45.92 --> 00:40:54.20 And obviously, but you don't want to be the guy that's doing the shooting because then you've gone too far far forward to actually be detached and make decisions
00:40:56.08 --> 00:41:00.96 Certainly combat is not going to be that simple the gap then might be any
00:41:01.28 --> 00:41:06.76 Undefended point or any weekly defended point it may be any enemy vulnerability
00:41:07.12 --> 00:41:09.12 It might be the enemies flanks
00:41:09.12 --> 00:41:15.92 The term flank itself needs some elaboration think of it as a relative thing
00:41:16.24 --> 00:41:20.08 John Boyd defines a flank as that aspect that aspect
00:41:20.64 --> 00:41:24.08 Toward which a force is not devoting its primary attention
00:41:24.72 --> 00:41:31.44 In other words in fluid warfare what is one moment the enemy's flank might the next moment be the enemy's front?
00:41:31.68 --> 00:41:34.20 It depends on how he is directing his attention a
00:41:34.20 --> 00:41:40.04 Gap for the infantry could be an enemy missile site manned by troops who are not combat oriented
00:41:40.36 --> 00:41:49.04 The missile site might be a surface if you are flying on an airplane, but a gap if you were a light infantryman who has gotten inside enemy lines
00:41:52.12 --> 00:41:53.64 So
00:41:53.64 --> 00:41:57.60 It does that make sense to you so if you've got a if you've got a surface to air missile
00:41:57.60 --> 00:42:07.52 Launcher and it it has a radio or radar on it and it can track aircraft coming in and if you're a fighter aircraft
00:42:07.52 --> 00:42:10.80 You don't want to say what you want to stay away from that thing because it'll get you locked on radar
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:12.80 It's gonna fire a heat-seeking missile at you and kill you
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.84 So for them it's a surface it's a strong point for an aircraft it's a strong point
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000 But for a ground troop
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.88 They don't put you know the highest level of troops
00:42:22.88 --> 00:42:28.48 Guarding these things because they're in the rear a little bit they put like kind of you know some what they call him here
00:42:30.96 --> 00:42:36.000 They're manned by troops who are not combat oriented so that means it's a softer target
00:42:38.80 --> 00:42:42.80 Back to the book. Let us say we are unsuccessful in finding any gaps
00:42:44.48 --> 00:42:48.48 We may have to create gaps and there are ways of doing this
00:42:48.48 --> 00:42:54.96 So then they talk about the ways you can do it you can do it through fire power of a drop in bombs by suppression by assault
00:42:56.32 --> 00:43:02.72 All those different ways to create gaps with you know using direct fire to soften up targets
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:11.60 And then then I like these tactics a little bit better another way of creating gaps is through supporting attacks by attacking one point along the line
00:43:11.60 --> 00:43:21.84 We may divert the enemy from another point and by drawing them off created gap again this is in linear terms for instructional purposes for simplicity
00:43:22.32 --> 00:43:24.32 But do not get a linear mindset
00:43:25.28 --> 00:43:32.16 Sometimes a less costly way of creating a gap is through deception by causing the enemy to think that we will attack at one point
00:43:32.16 --> 00:43:35.36 There by enticing him to draw his forces off from another point
00:43:35.36 --> 00:43:40.16 And when he attack that point where he has weakened himself
00:43:41.76 --> 00:43:44.96 But what do we do about surfaces that is strong points?
00:43:45.36 --> 00:43:47.36 Sometimes they are best bypassed
00:43:48.16 --> 00:43:54.56 Once the enemy has been bypassed as strong point maybe cut off from its support and in that way his strong point eventually withers
00:43:54.88 --> 00:43:58.24 Away and becomes a weak point which we can attack later
00:43:58.24 --> 00:44:10.48 You know we talk a lot here about not attacking people's defensible positions and this is just a classic another way of saying that
00:44:10.48 --> 00:44:15.60 You know we talk about people with got the ego the big ego and how you don't want to confront that ego
00:44:15.60 --> 00:44:20.08 Well if you can bypass the ego eventually the ego doesn't become a factor anymore
00:44:20.72 --> 00:44:23.36 And that's the same thing when you're doing ground combat
00:44:23.36 --> 00:44:33.04 Back to the book you're certain problems presented by the concept of surfaces and gaps especially to commanders who are used to slow moving forms of combat
00:44:33.84 --> 00:44:37.68 One is that the commander will not always know where all his people are
00:44:38.64 --> 00:44:44.32 In the Marine Corps we have become used to being accountable at all times for knowing exactly where every man is
00:44:45.52 --> 00:44:49.84 In this faster moving form of combat to do so would be impossible
00:44:49.84 --> 00:44:56.000 Your subordinates are finding the gaps and exploiting them so you've got you if you're control freak
00:44:57.36 --> 00:44:59.36 You're not gonna be able to pull this off
00:44:59.60 --> 00:45:05.60 Because I'm saying where are you echo where are you echo where are you? No echo is out there. He's working. He's finding some gaps to get through
00:45:06.16 --> 00:45:08.16 Not no exactly where he is
00:45:08.72 --> 00:45:11.60 Another problem is that artillery in air might not be
00:45:11.60 --> 00:45:19.44 May not be controlled as closely as is possible in slowing slower moving forms of combat so you start to
00:45:19.84 --> 00:45:26.000 Deal with the problems of of air support and artillery is a little trickier to use because you have people moving
00:45:26.96 --> 00:45:30.32 Around the battlefield and you're not sure where everyone is and that makes it very difficult
00:45:30.32 --> 00:45:32.32 Because you obviously don't want to drop bombs on your own people
00:45:33.20 --> 00:45:38.64 Another problem associated with the concept of surfaces and gaps is that as we penetrate deeply
00:45:38.64 --> 00:45:42.32 Often on narrow fronts our flanks become exposed
00:45:43.12 --> 00:45:46.56 There are however compensating factors again related to speed
00:45:47.20 --> 00:45:54.40 We are moving quickly the enemy is always off balance remember the old adage there is security in speed
00:45:55.84 --> 00:46:00.72 So in other words as you penetrate into a into a zone you're gonna be exposed a little bit
00:46:00.72 --> 00:46:10.16 But if you're moving fast you can deal with that exposure
00:46:08.80 --> 00:46:16.64 Critics of these faster moving forms of combat characterized by initiative at the low level fear that they will lead groups
00:46:17.12 --> 00:46:23.20 To groups of men moving willy nearly about the battlefield and that commanders will lose control
00:46:23.20 --> 00:46:27.84 So people say oh, you know if I give so much so much initiative at the low level
00:46:27.84 --> 00:46:32.56 I'm gonna lose control of it and people are gonna be running around like chickens with their heads cut off
00:46:33.28 --> 00:46:39.92 This need not be so if the concept of surfaces and gaps is employed properly it will not be so
00:46:40.32 --> 00:46:46.16 That is why we have control measures the boundary the limit of advance the phase line can still be used
00:46:46.56 --> 00:46:50.40 It must be remembered that these control measures should serve their function
00:46:50.40 --> 00:46:55.28 But not be rigid lines that cannot be changed or ignored when the situation changes
00:46:55.28 --> 00:47:00.000 They should be kept to a minimum and must always be flexible
00:47:00.56 --> 00:47:07.60 The tactics must never follow the control measures on the contrary the control measures must follow the tactics
00:47:08.48 --> 00:47:11.84 And the tactics must always be based on the enemy
00:47:12.64 --> 00:47:19.04 Other concepts that will be discussed in the chapters ahead especially that of the main effort
00:47:19.04 --> 00:47:27.04 Give us meaning gives us means of keeping control over our troops and preventing a situation where they can be said to be moving
00:47:27.44 --> 00:47:29.76 Willy nearly about the battlefield
00:47:30.72 --> 00:47:34.16 So decentralized command it it is challenging and
00:47:35.28 --> 00:47:37.76 If you don't do it right you will have chaos
00:47:40.40 --> 00:47:42.40 So now we get into the next section
00:47:42.40 --> 00:47:48.40 It does say lecture again, but again, I'm not here to lecture anybody. I don't think I don't think I can pull that off
00:47:50.64 --> 00:47:54.72 The concept this one this section is called mission tactics
00:47:57.04 --> 00:48:02.56 The concept of mission tactics like surfaces and gaps must always be at work in battle
00:48:03.60 --> 00:48:06.88 The name is the name is derived from the German
00:48:06.88 --> 00:48:12.48 Alph-Trags tactic which means literally mission tactics
00:48:13.04 --> 00:48:16.80 It is no accident that the naming includes the word tactics
00:48:17.52 --> 00:48:21.84 Assigning a mission and depending on subordinates to carry it out
00:48:22.24 --> 00:48:29.44 Constituits the tactic to allow the subordinate to decide on his own initiative
00:48:29.84 --> 00:48:36.24 What to do is the means of getting the most appropriate decisions made on the spot and acted on
00:48:36.24 --> 00:48:39.60 More rapidly than the enemy can respond to your actions
00:48:41.76 --> 00:48:43.76 Gotta get your subordinate
00:48:43.76 --> 00:48:46.56 Leadership to lead you want them to lead
00:48:49.76 --> 00:48:56.40 This is the account of Prince Frederick Charles who is giving a tonn Lashing to one of his majors for committing a tactical
00:48:56.40 --> 00:49:00.80 Blunder in defensive his action the major explain that he was only following orders
00:49:00.80 --> 00:49:07.44 In the press and army the major reminded the prince and order from a senior officer was tentant about to an order from the king
00:49:08.32 --> 00:49:10.32 The prince was on impressed
00:49:10.32 --> 00:49:18.48 His reply to the major was the king made you a major because he thought you were smart enough to know when not to obey orders
00:49:20.64 --> 00:49:28.24 And that is the essence of mission tactics the subordinate decides what to do even if even if it means that the order
00:49:28.24 --> 00:49:38.000 Issued by his senior now should be changed or adjusted the mission assigned is sacred the mission is the output that the commander wants
00:49:38.24 --> 00:49:46.80 That does not change but how that output is to be achieved may change and it's up to the intelligent
00:49:47.84 --> 00:49:51.92 Subordinate to decide whether or not it has
00:49:54.80 --> 00:49:56.08 total
00:49:56.08 --> 00:49:57.52 freedom
00:49:57.52 --> 00:49:59.52 for the subordinate leadership
00:50:00.08 --> 00:50:04.88 to figure out how they want to make this happen. They know what they need to get done
00:50:05.60 --> 00:50:09.44 But they they have the freedom to figure out how they're gonna make it happen
00:50:10.72 --> 00:50:16.24 Back to the book there is a classic example used time and time again and introducing the student to mission tactics
00:50:16.24 --> 00:50:22.40 It is simple and a value so we'll be used to get here the subordinate is giving the mission of getting his unit across the river
00:50:22.72 --> 00:50:26.08 Getting his unit across the river is the output the senior desires
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:33.28 The route that he has been given crosses the nearest bridge the junior commander arrives at the site to find that the bridge is been destroyed
00:50:33.92 --> 00:50:39.84 He does not stop he does not wait for new orders. He does not request permission to change his route
00:50:40.08 --> 00:50:44.24 He goes to the nearest forward several kilometers distance and he crosses there
00:50:44.72 --> 00:50:48.24 He informs the senior of course as soon as he can but he does not wait
00:50:49.28 --> 00:50:55.12 Remember mission orders are necessary to give the tempo of operations the rapidity that it must have
00:50:55.12 --> 00:51:00.000 If we are to keep the enemy off balance so that's a very simple example
00:51:00.56 --> 00:51:01.84 I tell echo hey
00:51:01.84 --> 00:51:06.80 I need your I need your troops across that river go across that bridge you get there the bridges out
00:51:06.80 --> 00:51:10.24 You're like oh, I'm still gonna get across the river here. Let's find a point in the place
00:51:10.24 --> 00:51:13.52 We can go across or let's make it happen and you're gonna make it happen
00:51:14.64 --> 00:51:19.52 Not gonna bother me you're not gonna call me back. You know me hey the bridge is out. We'll meet you now
00:51:20.48 --> 00:51:22.48 Something that this is a little bit
00:51:22.48 --> 00:51:29.52 This is a little bit simplified because the reality is if you're gonna start moving kilometers away from where I anticipated you being
00:51:29.52 --> 00:51:35.04 You need to tell me that you're moving you need to tell me because I might have other friendly units in the area that might
00:51:35.04 --> 00:51:38.24 Don't expect you I might have big drop in bombs in that area
00:51:38.24 --> 00:51:43.04 So this is this is actually leaving out some critical coordination that does have to happen
00:51:43.28 --> 00:51:47.04 But the initiative to make it happen should happen. Yeah, it seems like you
00:51:47.04 --> 00:51:53.60 Like in the in the process of that decentralized command the person carrying out the order is
00:51:54.72 --> 00:51:57.04 It's kind of to his discretion how much?
00:51:57.04 --> 00:52:01.12 He's gonna deviate when something changes like he can't he's of course is gonna deviate
00:52:01.12 --> 00:52:06.40 He's gonna make those adjustments, but you don't want a deviate too much right and and honestly
00:52:06.40 --> 00:52:10.32 If I was to give you directions hey echo I need you going to cry. I need you across the river
00:52:10.32 --> 00:52:16.64 I would literally give you some parameters to work with it. I say don't go don't go further south than this area than this road
00:52:16.64 --> 00:52:19.44 And don't go further north than this you can do whatever you want inside of here
00:52:19.44 --> 00:52:23.84 So now you can do whatever you want inside that box. Yeah, and how you always talk about you
00:52:23.84 --> 00:52:26.80 You'll say like why are you going across the river as well? Yeah
00:52:29.44 --> 00:52:34.24 And for speaking of why and here's another example of mission orders
00:52:35.44 --> 00:52:37.44 This is an actual example
00:52:37.44 --> 00:52:46.16 C's control of root six west of the muddy river in order to destroy enemy forces attempting to escape from company
00:52:46.16 --> 00:52:48.16 Bravo's zone of action
00:52:50.24 --> 00:52:51.84 So
00:52:51.84 --> 00:52:58.64 It's telling you the why that's what the in order to is notice in the mission order the phrase in order to
00:52:58.80 --> 00:53:02.08 That is a very important phrase and usually ought to go in the mission order
00:53:02.08 --> 00:53:09.12 There's no rule that every mission order contain the phrase in order to if you were told attack the enemy company that you see in front of you
00:53:09.12 --> 00:53:11.52 It would probably be highly superfluous to tell you why
00:53:12.88 --> 00:53:16.08 They are there they are threat why waste the breath
00:53:16.56 --> 00:53:22.24 But usually your mission order will have the ability to endure time better if you explain the
00:53:22.24 --> 00:53:29.28 Spordinate why he is carrying the mission out so you called the seco turning to a little tactical genius over there. Aren't you?
00:53:29.28 --> 00:53:32.24 In order to this gives
00:53:33.44 --> 00:53:41.60 the order the quality that Eric von Mannstein called long term it can endure the test of time your commander can lose
00:53:41.60 --> 00:53:47.68 Communication with you yet you can still carry out his intent because you know what he wanted and you can
00:53:47.84 --> 00:53:51.36 Continue to act within his intent for a long time without checking back
00:53:52.72 --> 00:53:55.44 Understand why as briefed by
00:53:55.44 --> 00:53:58.32 Lieutenant Colonel echo Charles
00:54:02.08 --> 00:54:10.48 Fixed rules are not appropriate in instructing how to as how to assign missions to often students reject good ideas about tactics
00:54:10.48 --> 00:54:15.84 Because they cannot get their thoughts to fit the format of the operation order that is
00:54:16.40 --> 00:54:21.20 Being demanded the important thing is that the mission be clear
00:54:21.20 --> 00:54:26.80 Compared to clarity format is of little or no consequence
00:54:27.28 --> 00:54:28.48 Then this is
00:54:28.48 --> 00:54:32.96 We talk about it in extreme ownership that these massive power point briefs that
00:54:33.68 --> 00:54:38.80 I mean hundreds literally you know hundred to 150 slides to try and make the
00:54:40.08 --> 00:54:46.32 To try and brief a mission when and and the leaders would away so much time trying to put these briefs together
00:54:46.32 --> 00:54:51.28 And and they would they wouldn't do the planning that they're supposed to be doing they wouldn't be thinking
00:54:51.68 --> 00:54:56.96 They'd be building power point slides and I've just had to get these guys to think and
00:54:57.68 --> 00:55:00.88 Stop stop working on the power points. Stop trying to match your font
00:55:01.60 --> 00:55:06.48 Chop time to equalize the huge on each slide to make it look pretty no don't care
00:55:06.96 --> 00:55:11.60 What I want you to think and I want clarity of mission is the most important thing the matter of fact
00:55:11.60 --> 00:55:18.16 I didn't want guys running training and any guy says to me it's one of the one of the task units commanders and he says hey, you know
00:55:18.16 --> 00:55:26.72 What is it what is it that you're looking for in the brief and he's you know trying to figure out how many slides do I want to see and what format do I want to see and I said
00:55:26.96 --> 00:55:30.96 What I want for the brief is that your men understand the operation
00:55:32.48 --> 00:55:34.48 boom
00:55:34.48 --> 00:55:44.80 Back to the book the subordinate receiving that order must be more talented amateur troops awkward clumsy
00:55:44.80 --> 00:55:48.72 Untrained troops cannot be expected to carry out mission orders why?
00:55:49.60 --> 00:55:55.84 Because as a result of their lack of experience they must be told what to do only the professional experience leader
00:55:55.84 --> 00:56:02.16 Can know what to do without being told what to do because we in the Marine Corps set our standard side
00:56:02.16 --> 00:56:06.64 We expect that our subordinates will train until they can perform under mission orders
00:56:07.20 --> 00:56:12.56 So just I don't know if I made this clear or if I breeze over this part mission orders is exactly
00:56:12.96 --> 00:56:15.20 What we're talking about when it comes to hey just tell the person
00:56:16.08 --> 00:56:18.08 This is what I need done
00:56:18.08 --> 00:56:23.60 And this is why I want it done you figured out as opposed to telling them exactly what you want them to do
00:56:24.80 --> 00:56:27.76 Commander sent him yes indeed commanders intent
00:56:27.76 --> 00:56:37.04 burdens of responsibility increase on both sides on the part of the senior commander so when you're doing mission orders
00:56:37.04 --> 00:56:42.40 The burden of responsibility increases on the part of the senior commander and on the part of the subordinate
00:56:43.36 --> 00:56:49.60 Look first at the senior commander operating with mission orders his orders must be perfectly clear
00:56:50.16 --> 00:56:56.40 The onus is on the senior to define to the junior what must be accomplished without telling him how to do it
00:56:56.40 --> 00:57:01.36 The onus is not on the junior to fair it out what his commander wants
00:57:02.16 --> 00:57:09.20 The senior must state what he wants otherwise he should not expect to get it now I actually when I when I teach people this
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.60 I tell them that the onus is on the junior and if if I tell you to do some
00:57:14.64 --> 00:57:19.68 And you don't understand why you're doing it and you don't understand what my intent is and you still go in the field and try and do it
00:57:19.68 --> 00:57:23.76 I blame you I mean it's my fault too, but we're both taking ownership
00:57:23.76 --> 00:57:29.84 Might even say we're taking extreme ownership of the situation, but really if your boss isn't telling you why you're why you're
00:57:29.84 --> 00:57:33.20 Why they're telling you to do something you just raise your hand and ask K boss
00:57:33.44 --> 00:57:39.04 What's your objective here what's your overall intent? What's the commanders intent? Because I want to make sure if I lose communications with you
00:57:39.60 --> 00:57:44.72 I can continue to execute towards your desired end state. So we're looking for
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.52 An additional burden of responsibility on the seniors that he must train his subordinates and his unit to
00:57:53.52 --> 00:57:59.36 Operate as a team they are not going to be able to perform mission orders without training
00:58:00.64 --> 00:58:04.88 Another new burden of responsibility is that he must expect his subordinates to make mistakes
00:58:05.36 --> 00:58:11.76 He may not expect zero defects wars are one by people not machines people make mistakes
00:58:12.32 --> 00:58:14.64 If people are more afraid of making mistakes
00:58:14.88 --> 00:58:20.40 Then they are of exercising initiative now and then they will not take risks and they will not exercise initiative
00:58:20.40 --> 00:58:24.16 Furthermore, they will not win in war
00:58:26.24 --> 00:58:33.44 Perhaps the most important new responsibility is placed on the commander who gives mission orders is that he must trust his subordinates
00:58:34.40 --> 00:58:38.16 If trust breaks down the whole system breaks down
00:58:38.80 --> 00:58:42.08 So people ask me about trust from time to time and
00:58:43.20 --> 00:58:49.20 It's absolutely I use I've talked about relationships the R word and that's what that's what it is and
00:58:49.20 --> 00:58:55.92 Lief and I talked about the other day on the podcast is that just building trust how but one of the best ways to build trust is
00:58:56.96 --> 00:59:02.32 Give it I give it and so that's what goes back and forth and in the military you do that when you're in the training environment
00:59:03.12 --> 00:59:05.12 When there's no risk
00:59:05.12 --> 00:59:09.44 Or very very tiny risk of life and limb. There's no strategic left you're not your risk
00:59:09.44 --> 00:59:11.76 You're not going to lose the war so I'm going to let you run with stuff
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.60 I want you to learn I want you to take risk and if you fail if you screw something up
00:59:15.60 --> 00:59:23.84 I don't try and fire you we try and learn from it and that encourages you to take initiative and keep getting after it
00:59:30.24 --> 00:59:34.88 Now the the we're moving to the next section
00:59:36.56 --> 00:59:38.56 Which is called the main effort
00:59:38.56 --> 00:59:47.84 the commander in making his plan must determine what and where his main effort is in every
00:59:47.92 --> 00:59:52.24 Operation whether it be offensive defensive or withdrawal
00:59:53.44 --> 01:00:01.76 This main effort should be specified in the operation order it should always be clearly stated in paragraph three a the concept of operation
01:00:01.76 --> 01:00:10.000 There can only be one main effort when you start giving two or three or a three part main effort
01:00:10.24 --> 01:00:15.44 You'd better look back at it because the chances are you do you have not made up your mind
01:00:16.08 --> 01:00:18.08 What you are trying to do
01:00:20.40 --> 01:00:25.36 So if you're trying to plan a mission you're telling you're telling people there's three main things
01:00:25.36 --> 01:00:28.64 We're trying to get done no wrong. There should be one yep
01:00:28.64 --> 01:00:32.64 Yeah in message conveyance
01:00:34.32 --> 01:00:39.52 Actually, I think it's a newspaper writing they call it bearing the lead it's like your main story
01:00:40.72 --> 01:00:47.60 Has to you know you can't have three main stories in one article got it because and you know one story is gonna have cool details
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:53.92 But you start spending a bunch of time on these cool details they call that bearing the lead
01:00:53.92 --> 01:01:00.24 Uh, bad deal and so don't do that on the newspaper business and don't do that on that'll feel
01:01:02.80 --> 01:01:08.88 Every unit commander down to the company commander will always assign a main effort and sometimes even a platoon commander should
01:01:09.84 --> 01:01:15.76 The entire command must be aware of what and where the main effort is
01:01:16.64 --> 01:01:19.52 The commander can change the main effort at any time
01:01:19.52 --> 01:01:25.36 This is what gives the operation its fluidity and and this is one of the
01:01:26.96 --> 01:01:31.20 Pretty common issues that we run it ran into it when I was running training
01:01:31.84 --> 01:01:37.12 Run into it now in the business world where you work with a company and they're not they're not assigning a main effort
01:01:37.12 --> 01:01:43.12 They're concentrating on 14 different things at the same time. They don't prioritize next gives this is another form of prioritize next cute
01:01:43.12 --> 01:01:50.64 And that's a problem because if you're trying to do 14 things it wants you're gonna not the compost any of them
01:01:52.48 --> 01:01:55.84 The German word for main effort is shit-poked
01:01:57.28 --> 01:02:03.20 Anytime in your readings when you see that and often you will see it written in italics the German word shfrit punk
01:02:03.52 --> 01:02:08.32 Take note because it is one of the most important underlying concepts in everything the Germans do
01:02:08.32 --> 01:02:13.60 Make the main effort where the enemy least expects you
01:02:15.12 --> 01:02:18.72 Make the enemy make the main effort where the enemy is weak
01:02:19.76 --> 01:02:21.76 Be prepared to be surprised
01:02:23.36 --> 01:02:25.36 So let's go I gotta stop right there
01:02:26.08 --> 01:02:31.44 It's interesting you know when you see the big fortified area of the enemy you say okay
01:02:31.44 --> 01:02:39.60 We're gonna we better we better attack that hard no wrong answer that's a surface we're looking for gaps so don't make the main effort
01:02:40.48 --> 01:02:47.44 The the strong point make it the weak point back to the book be prepared to be surprised
01:02:48.32 --> 01:02:53.60 Be weary of the council do not ever be surprised in war you will be surprised
01:02:54.16 --> 01:02:56.80 The task is to learn to deal with surprise
01:02:56.80 --> 01:03:02.40 If what you thought would be an enemy weakness becomes the enemy strength you should not be disrupted
01:03:02.96 --> 01:03:10.16 If your taxes tactics are fluid you can deal with surprise you will shift your main effort to enemy weakness and go on through
01:03:10.96 --> 01:03:13.52 That is how the main effort works in the offense
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000 Fluidity
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.92 Remember we even hear it a lot about in the Vietnam war the the Vietcong were too rigid they would just try their plan
01:03:23.92 --> 01:03:30.32 Didn't have the fluidity the main effort should be directed against enemy weakness not enemy strength
01:03:30.40 --> 01:03:37.28 Here you see the interconnection between the concepts the connection between the concept of the main effort and the concept of surfaces and gaps
01:03:37.84 --> 01:03:46.16 All the concepts are worked together at the same time the main effort cannot be understood in isolation from surfaces and gaps because it is directed against enemy weakness
01:03:46.16 --> 01:03:54.48 And another another
01:03:55.60 --> 01:04:00.56 One of the four laws combat that we talk about in the book extreme ownership is simplicity
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000 Simple back to the book even the principle of simplicity can be recognized in the concept of the main effort
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.52 Instead of trying to do 10 different things we are focusing on one
01:04:11.52 --> 01:04:16.16 There will be many other efforts going on at the same time, but all in some way
01:04:16.56 --> 01:04:18.88 Directed at making the main effort succeed
01:04:19.84 --> 01:04:22.48 So what do you gain from this main effort?
01:04:22.96 --> 01:04:29.44 You gain direction you great you gain fluidity you gain speed and you prevent
01:04:29.68 --> 01:04:32.16 Disappaining your efforts all over the battlefield
01:04:33.36 --> 01:04:39.76 The way the polls did when the Germans invaded Poland they tried to defend their entire 800 mile front
01:04:39.76 --> 01:04:44.40 There was no main effort and by trying to be strong everywhere
01:04:44.80 --> 01:04:47.12 They weren't fact strong nowhere
01:04:48.32 --> 01:04:53.84 This trying to cover all the bases is a common error in the amateur commanders plan
01:04:54.16 --> 01:05:02.56 It is a symptom of avoidance of decision making avoidance of decision making so if you're not saying hey here's what we're gonna focus on you're just
01:05:02.88 --> 01:05:06.24 I'm gonna wait. I don't want to decide yet. Oh, I'm not ready to commit
01:05:06.24 --> 01:05:11.52 By establishing a main effort you make a clear decision
01:05:12.64 --> 01:05:18.88 You obviate the necessity for junior officers to keep asking for guidance
01:05:19.36 --> 01:05:24.96 If they know their commanders main effort they can continue to operate even though communications may be cut and
01:05:24.96 --> 01:05:31.20 They can continue to operate at a high tempo because they need not keep checking back for new orders
01:05:31.20 --> 01:05:40.48 In here we get to another something you might recognize from from our book
01:05:41.04 --> 01:05:46.64 Stream ownership when the commander has made this decision he has done something very necessary
01:05:47.52 --> 01:05:49.52 He has done something very ethical
01:05:50.40 --> 01:05:53.60 He has assumed and taken responsibility
01:05:54.56 --> 01:05:57.12 For what will happen if the battle goes a ride?
01:05:57.12 --> 01:06:04.72 He cannot blame his subordinates. He can only blame himself. It was he who decided what was to be done
01:06:05.68 --> 01:06:08.72 And designated a main effort in order to do it
01:06:09.36 --> 01:06:14.08 Therefore it takes courage and moral character to select a main effort
01:06:14.64 --> 01:06:16.64 That is why the weak
01:06:16.32 --> 01:06:24.64 Commander and the amateur so often failed to do this in fact the weak commander will actively avoid choosing a main effort
01:06:24.64 --> 01:06:32.08 His very convenient for the commander weak and character to avoid selecting the main effort because if the battle goes on
01:06:32.08 --> 01:06:35.20 Favorably he can blame someone else for the mistake
01:06:36.32 --> 01:06:41.92 The commander who has taken the stand and selected his own main effort cannot do this
01:06:42.96 --> 01:06:48.56 Therefore in a sense the main effort is a moral commitment
01:06:48.56 --> 01:06:54.32 Taking some ownership by selecting the main effort
01:06:55.36 --> 01:06:57.36 And you got to dig that
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.32 The next concept in again, you know I'm I'm cruising through this book like I always do only reading
01:07:06.32 --> 01:07:08.32 I don't know probably
01:07:09.36 --> 01:07:12.72 A very small percentage of it 15 percent and
01:07:13.92 --> 01:07:15.92 There's a ton in here
01:07:15.92 --> 01:07:17.92 And it actually has some very cool
01:07:20.88 --> 01:07:27.04 Like exercises where it gives you a scenario that's happening and you go through and you figure out what you would do and it gives you good solutions
01:07:27.04 --> 01:07:29.44 So it's gotten it's got it's it's a great book to look at
01:07:31.04 --> 01:07:33.04 The next lecture
01:07:33.92 --> 01:07:35.92 Is called the concept of the objective
01:07:37.52 --> 01:07:43.84 According to the chair according to joint chiefs and staff publication number one dictionary of military and associated terms
01:07:43.84 --> 01:07:48.56 The objective is the physical object of the action taken a
01:07:49.68 --> 01:07:56.08 Definite tactical feature seizure and or holding of which is essential to the commander's plan
01:07:57.44 --> 01:07:59.44 That definition is clear enough
01:08:00.96 --> 01:08:06.10 Basel the del heart would have disagreed with the JCS definition at one point in his writings
01:08:06.16 --> 01:08:10.56 The del heart stated the only real objective is the enemy
01:08:10.56 --> 01:08:12.56 The
01:08:12.56 --> 01:08:20.24 The del heart statement is also quite clear and understandable especially when we realize that whether we are attacking or defending the problem is always the enemy
01:08:21.20 --> 01:08:26.64 Once the enemy is taking out of the action defending and attacking are no longer necessary
01:08:32.96 --> 01:08:34.96 Now
01:08:34.56 --> 01:08:36.56 The the
01:08:36.56 --> 01:08:42.40 I guess the controversy here if we could call it that is the objective not being a
01:08:43.28 --> 01:08:46.64 Specific piece of terrain. It's the the objective is the enemy
01:08:48.72 --> 01:08:50.72 But that being said
01:08:52.48 --> 01:08:57.52 The terrain of course is extremely important we must use it to gain advantage
01:08:57.68 --> 01:09:05.68 But the object of the attack is the enemy the objective must be to take the enemy out of action to destroy him to disarm him
01:09:05.68 --> 01:09:10.96 We cannot do that simply by seizing a piece of terrain in holding it we must be prepared to move
01:09:11.20 --> 01:09:16.48 Continually wherever necessary to confuse and disrupt him through a combination of fire and movement
01:09:20.40 --> 01:09:24.000 When the term objective appears it means an aiming point
01:09:24.40 --> 01:09:31.76 That towards which we direct our efforts in order to best use the terrain to accomplish our final goal the destruction of the enemy
01:09:31.76 --> 01:09:39.76 The ability to wisely select an objective is the mark of a good commander
01:09:40.16 --> 01:09:47.44 The inability is the mark of an amateur and history is replete with examples of poorly selected objectives
01:09:48.24 --> 01:09:54.88 There were hills fought for bravely by Marines at Vietnam after they ceased being of any tactical value
01:09:54.88 --> 01:10:03.84 Lives were thrown away for meaningless terrain terrain that did not meet either of the two main criteria for selecting an objective
01:10:04.64 --> 01:10:12.40 two main criteria are one that is loop that it be useful to you or two deer to your enemy
01:10:13.20 --> 01:10:15.20 If it is neither one of these
01:10:15.76 --> 01:10:19.04 It is probably not worth the life of a single Marine
01:10:19.04 --> 01:10:24.96 Any good commander will therefore select terrain that is useful to him
01:10:25.52 --> 01:10:31.20 The great commander will have the ability to select terrain that is deer to the enemy
01:10:36.08 --> 01:10:41.28 In the final concept is the concept of the reserve
01:10:41.28 --> 01:10:53.12 General JFC follower of the British Army the original author of the nine principles of war that the US Army was to adopt in the 1920s
01:10:53.44 --> 01:10:58.40 Once stated that of all the principles he developed the most important was economy of force
01:10:59.44 --> 01:11:05.60 He reasoned that whichever side still had forces left after the other sides had been committed was bound to win
01:11:05.60 --> 01:11:16.48 Napoleon seems to have had similar thoughts when he observed that whoever still had his reserve remaining after his enemy had committed his reserve would win the battle
01:11:18.88 --> 01:11:20.88 And here's another
01:11:20.88 --> 01:11:22.88 quote in here from Napoleon
01:11:23.52 --> 01:11:28.40 That I think when they're talking about committing and it talks about your mindset on the battlefield
01:11:28.40 --> 01:11:40.32 From Napoleon if I appear to be always ready to reply to everything it is because before undertaking anything
01:11:40.72 --> 01:11:45.84 I have meditated for a long time I have for seeing what might happen
01:11:47.60 --> 01:11:55.52 It is not a spirit which suddenly reveals to me what I have to say or do in a circumstances in a circumstance unexpected by others
01:11:55.52 --> 01:11:58.96 It is a reflection a meditation
01:12:01.20 --> 01:12:06.32 So Napoleon he was good to have these quick reactions and everyone says wow he must have just had this
01:12:06.96 --> 01:12:11.20 Incredible you know he's calling a spirit this comes to him and says hey move these guys over here
01:12:11.20 --> 01:12:14.24 Hey, I sold that flag no here. He fought through this thing for hours
01:12:15.04 --> 01:12:19.28 He said if they do this I'm gonna do that if they come over here. I'm gonna be ready over here
01:12:21.20 --> 01:12:23.20 preparation
01:12:23.20 --> 01:12:34.000 What Napoleon was saying was that thorough thought in advance prepared him to make split second decisions when the situation suddenly changed
01:12:39.28 --> 01:12:41.28 Preparation
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.72 Preparation is key
01:12:44.72 --> 01:12:57.36 Now that wraps up the book and I hope that it provides some reminders and some insight to people not only to the war fighters out on the battlefield
01:12:57.36 --> 01:13:05.76 But as I said in the beginning I hope it provides some details in a dealing with humans with people and problems
01:13:05.76 --> 01:13:13.04 In the business world in leadership positions on that you just do math in life
01:13:15.04 --> 01:13:22.08 Whatever you're doing or whatever you're trying to get done think of how you can use maneuver warfare
01:13:23.44 --> 01:13:25.44 To make it happen
01:13:28.64 --> 01:13:30.64 And I guess we can
01:13:30.64 --> 01:13:36.72 Go over to some some questions from the interwebs and
01:13:38.48 --> 01:13:42.72 I guess before we go to the interwebs, maybe you could tell us about the interwebs and
01:13:44.40 --> 01:13:46.40 What we can do to support
01:13:47.44 --> 01:13:54.32 Support by being on interwebs if you're on the interwebs and you're in the mood to support this podcast and or yourself
01:13:54.32 --> 01:13:59.84 With supplementation go to on it dot com slash jockel
01:14:01.44 --> 01:14:05.60 Get on its supplements are the best ones I like that idea. Yeah
01:14:06.56 --> 01:14:09.84 Krill it's a good idea Krill oil for sure for you joint get in
01:14:10.64 --> 01:14:17.84 To bring some of that out for briny yeah some shrimp tech sport mode. Yeah, shrimp tech sport if you're into performance
01:14:18.72 --> 01:14:22.96 Physical activity performance if you feel you need a little turbo boost. Yeah
01:14:22.96 --> 01:14:24.96 Yeah, yeah, I was funny remember
01:14:26.56 --> 01:14:31.20 Tim Kennedy put it in like real real good terms in my opinion when he used like oh
01:14:32.08 --> 01:14:34.24 Yeah, when I took the shrimp tech it's kind of like
01:14:35.44 --> 01:14:41.04 Cuz okay, so you don't want to get confusing be like I'm gonna take the shrimp tech in it's like a like a caffeine boost or something
01:14:41.04 --> 01:14:45.92 You know, you don't because it's not that's not so it's and he put in these terms where he's like you know
01:14:45.92 --> 01:14:51.20 He you go a few rounds you go five six seven and you know however many rounds and everyone's like real poop
01:14:51.20 --> 01:14:56.40 But then you're kind of like I could go a few more rounds and really that is that is exactly how it is
01:14:56.40 --> 01:15:00.80 This one or when you're hitting towards the end of the round or whatever it's like you you feel solid
01:15:00.80 --> 01:15:05.28 You know, just you know, I guess apparently what it does is it helps you utilize your oxygen
01:15:05.28 --> 01:15:08.40 Yeah, and you'll feel like work. I mean obviously you're talking about your jitsu
01:15:08.56 --> 01:15:10.56 Which for those people that don't train jitsu?
01:15:10.56 --> 01:15:12.56 Which you should but if you don't
01:15:13.36 --> 01:15:15.36 Well you should
01:15:15.36 --> 01:15:18.08 But you're also gonna keep working out and you have the
01:15:18.08 --> 01:15:23.68 You know you so sort of a metabolic conditioning type type workout situation going on
01:15:24.56 --> 01:15:28.96 Remember how it's how telling you I did my met come metabolic conditioning after I yes
01:15:28.96 --> 01:15:32.48 Like normal lifting so I'll probably do in the reverse of that lately really
01:15:33.20 --> 01:15:37.04 I don't know I would have I think I was super warmed up. I'm dripping with sweat
01:15:37.04 --> 01:15:43.60 Yeah, and I just and I feel really good and then I figure maybe the opposite will happen because we both know if you go
01:15:43.60 --> 01:15:48.72 With your with your strength movements first you take a little bit off your metcon strike right?
01:15:49.12 --> 01:15:52.08 Yeah, if if you do and so that way when you do
01:15:52.64 --> 01:15:56.88 The metcon fresh you feel like super man right? Yeah, blasted your muscles out
01:15:57.44 --> 01:16:01.68 So I've been doing the reverse though when I'm doing the metcon type
01:16:02.32 --> 01:16:06.24 First and then I just breathe it out and then I get them there and be stuff
01:16:06.24 --> 01:16:11.84 Yeah, and I dig it on the only reason I say I dig it because you're savage like that but
01:16:11.84 --> 01:16:16.64 Consider because those are two what depend depend what kind of lifting you're doing
01:16:16.64 --> 01:16:20.64 Yeah, so let's say if not well if you're lifting like for strength or you know
01:16:21.04 --> 01:16:28.16 Muscle growth or whatever you should do that first because the results you seek are in line with you having full energy
01:16:28.48 --> 01:16:30.48 You lifting I agree with you
01:16:30.48 --> 01:16:36.40 And you think you're correct and the metcon isn't the results of the metcon is for you to recover from conditioning
01:16:36.40 --> 01:16:39.52 See it's muscular conditioning so if you're tired going in
01:16:39.52 --> 01:16:44.40 That's more conditioning you have to recover from better access. Yeah, so it's so essentially
01:16:44.40 --> 01:16:48.84 But hey if you want to reverse it give your body some some some stuff to your health
01:16:49.36 --> 01:16:55.36 This is funny because I completely agree with you and I've only been doing this for a couple months and I
01:16:55.36 --> 01:16:58.04 You know what it was you know what it was one day
01:16:58.04 --> 01:17:03.24 I was I was gonna do like a metcon pretty strong. It was feeling good sure and then I got done
01:17:03.24 --> 01:17:10.56 I said so I was I'm just gonna move some you know, but some some heavy get my lift on and when I when I went heavy
01:17:10.56 --> 01:17:12.08 I was like man that feels good
01:17:12.08 --> 01:17:17.04 Great all loose some all warm and so now I've just kind of started doing it a little bit
01:17:17.04 --> 01:17:21.44 Yeah, and if you get used to that then it'll start to be more and more benefit
01:17:21.44 --> 01:17:24.34 I used to I used to run on the treadmill. I used to do like three and a half miles
01:17:24.34 --> 01:17:27.32 I'm in four miles and then lift
01:17:27.32 --> 01:17:32.88 Just because I didn't have time and and every time I lived I would never feel like running the you know the mile
01:17:32.88 --> 01:17:35.48 Afterwards I do not tread no, so I
01:17:35.48 --> 01:17:40.80 So I mean what I'm gonna get the running out of the way that I'm gonna lift and then I was like dang lifting is kind of harder
01:17:40.80 --> 01:17:44.72 But I'd wait rather endure this discomfort when I'm lifting then when I'm running on the treadmill
01:17:44.72 --> 01:17:48.50 But I did that for months and months and months and then one day I didn't run. I was like
01:17:48.92 --> 01:17:52.88 It was weird. I was like stiff. Yeah, so you can't even use to it
01:17:52.88 --> 01:17:58.10 But either way. I mean what my original point is I do the met now. I do the Mechon after I live
01:17:58.50 --> 01:18:02.44 Doing the Mechon after that lift that has been my standard for so long
01:18:02.76 --> 01:18:08.36 Right, but you know how you're saying do the Mechon before you live or or you're just doing the Mechon that it's easier
01:18:08.68 --> 01:18:11.72 Yeah, because you're not a start-up thing. Yeah, yeah
01:18:12.40 --> 01:18:16.24 Yeah, but I'm anyway my original point was the shroom tech
01:18:16.36 --> 01:18:21.08 So if you're doing that kind of thing after you lift when you're going into the Mechon you can feel way better
01:18:21.08 --> 01:18:26.84 You want to hear something cool. So a lot of times people ask me what is your workout?
01:18:27.16 --> 01:18:29.76 Right, they want to know reps sets
01:18:30.72 --> 01:18:36.72 Wait yeah, right and that's cool. Of course and I haven't I haven't put it out there for
01:18:38.24 --> 01:18:40.24 Well, I'm I got a book
01:18:40.88 --> 01:18:45.02 Putting together a book. Let's go to have a book kind of thing. I just not gonna be any books. I'm a little boy
01:18:45.02 --> 01:18:51.74 Yeah, I got a real legit book on which means gonna take a little more time
01:18:51.74 --> 01:18:57.74 But I'd rather do it do it right, but what's interesting is this is what's so cool so
01:18:58.58 --> 01:19:04.74 People that people listen to podcasts and ask and they have been applying the basic principles
01:19:05.02 --> 01:19:08.78 Because I have never put I haven't put out. I don't think I put out a single workout
01:19:08.78 --> 01:19:16.42 I also people say what do you actually eat? Right then want to know what I had for breakfast lunch dinner
01:19:16.42 --> 01:19:17.42 What I had for snacks whatever
01:19:17.42 --> 01:19:20.74 Yeah, all I say is like oh, you know, I mostly you know
01:19:20.74 --> 01:19:25.82 I I low very low carbs. I eat a lot of meat. I do a lot of protein. I eat a lot of fat
01:19:26.30 --> 01:19:27.66 Okay
01:19:27.66 --> 01:19:33.32 What do you do for workouts? I get up early in the morning. I hit it hard. You know, am I doing squats and doing poultry
01:19:33.32 --> 01:19:38.80 Doing it just basic stuff right now put those basic principles out there well
01:19:38.80 --> 01:19:43.50 There's people troopers that have been applying these basic principles
01:19:43.50 --> 01:19:49.48 And they're making incredible progress in their lives. They're getting stronger. They're getting leaner
01:19:49.64 --> 01:19:52.68 They're getting in better shape. So it's actually
01:19:53.68 --> 01:19:56.92 proven because I remember you and I talked about this long time ago. I said listen
01:19:58.12 --> 01:20:02.40 It's more about the commanders intent right that they're working out about the commanders intent
01:20:02.40 --> 01:20:08.76 It's not about I'm gonna tell you how many reps and sets to do. I'm gonna tell you what you want to make happen
01:20:08.76 --> 01:20:13.16 Right, I'm gonna tell you where you want what where you want to be at the end of this workout
01:20:13.92 --> 01:20:15.92 physically and mentally and
01:20:16.32 --> 01:20:20.48 And and people have been taking that and I mean all kinds of people
01:20:21.08 --> 01:20:25.16 They have lost 28 pounds of lost 42 pounds just from
01:20:25.76 --> 01:20:29.88 Applying the basic principles that I and and so those will be consolidated in the book
01:20:29.88 --> 01:20:34.92 So that people can follow them and they'll be some other good stuff in the book to basic philosophy
01:20:38.88 --> 01:20:43.40 Well, that was kind of a tangent on on it wasn't it well, I rightly so I think
01:20:44.04 --> 01:20:46.68 Right that he so I think so it's it's
01:20:47.68 --> 01:20:54.32 Which which actually kind of brings me to my point that consistency is probably the most overlooked that even though people know
01:20:54.32 --> 01:20:59.08 Yeah, you gotta be consistent. We got it but that's kind of everything because everything else is variable
01:20:59.08 --> 01:21:01.88 Like you can there's a
01:21:03.16 --> 01:21:05.64 Billion different work by consistency do you mean
01:21:08.40 --> 01:21:15.80 Doing of the same thing or you just mean doing it every day getting in there. I ain't it. Yeah, absolutely not skipping days weeks
01:21:15.80 --> 01:21:17.98 You know getting off the horse, you know that kind of stuff
01:21:18.32 --> 01:21:22.02 There's a million different workouts. You can do that will give you results and
01:21:22.02 --> 01:21:28.96 There's the nine different results that you can you can kind of strive for and get because it just so many same thing with diet
01:21:28.96 --> 01:21:33.82 Like you can you know you people have their rigid diet philosophy, but the fact is that
01:21:34.54 --> 01:21:38.22 Many different diets work. Yeah, I mean there's some basic principles
01:21:38.22 --> 01:21:43.38 You don't need a bunch of sugar. You don't need a bunch of fast food. You don't you know the obvious things to avoid
01:21:44.10 --> 01:21:48.78 And you can get results with many kinds of diet and I would go one step further
01:21:48.78 --> 01:21:55.66 What you're talking about consistency in in in order to have consistency that requires the distance
01:21:56.22 --> 01:22:03.14 It does require the discipline. So that's the factor. Yep. That is the key factor and when people apply the discipline to their lives boom
01:22:03.14 --> 01:22:09.02 Right now we think becomes consistent and that's everything. You know so the books can come in the books can talk about that
01:22:09.78 --> 01:22:11.78 There you go
01:22:11.78 --> 01:22:18.10 Yeah, how well how well to support the podcast if you before you do your Amazon shopping hmm

01:24:52.56 --> 01:24:57.88 Oh, he has a nice car too, by the way. It's a little bit extra cool. You know, it was like extra official. Yeah
01:24:58.52 --> 01:25:00.52 We got some real
01:25:00.52 --> 01:25:01.52 supporter
01:25:01.52 --> 01:25:03.52 Yeah, that's what I felt like
01:25:03.52 --> 01:25:05.52 Also
01:25:06.24 --> 01:25:10.08 Subscribe to the YouTube channel and you post it your first
01:25:11.08 --> 01:25:14.48 Start to put it and that's a it's a deleted scene
01:25:16.96 --> 01:25:21.44 Keep you tight on those deleted scene if you want to hear echo Charles talking about
01:25:21.44 --> 01:25:23.44 My kids look
01:25:23.44 --> 01:25:29.04 My kids my kids are our about alien abducters a lot of podcasts about is that a son of a guy?
01:25:29.04 --> 01:25:32.28 I'm not working to fit in that subcategory leadership or
01:25:33.20 --> 01:25:35.20 Darkness alien abduction
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:41.52 Maybe that's why it's an outtake that was more like an example underlying
01:25:42.24 --> 01:25:46.88 Kind of thing is more about my children's look idea. Okay. We're good. We're good
01:25:47.44 --> 01:25:50.96 Anyway, those are the ways yep on duck-up slash jocco. That's a good one
01:25:50.96 --> 01:25:57.44 Like I said for the supplement 10% off. I forgot to mention that if you don't know 10% off the supplements. Yeah, good
01:25:58.44 --> 01:26:04.76 I guess with that let's get down to the questions from the troopers on the interwebs
01:26:05.96 --> 01:26:07.96 Get a lot of questions lately
01:26:08.52 --> 01:26:11.52 I like it I like it to first question
01:26:12.84 --> 01:26:15.80 Jocco if you were coaching migraegher
01:26:16.40 --> 01:26:19.12 For those don't know that's karma-graegher you have to see fighter
01:26:19.12 --> 01:26:25.52 What would you focus on to try and make up the jiu-jitsu disparity all defense?
01:26:28.60 --> 01:26:32.04 Interesting and if you don't know what's going on
01:26:34.64 --> 01:26:37.16 Conor McGregor is fighting made Diaz again
01:26:37.72 --> 01:26:39.72 202 UFC
01:26:39.72 --> 01:26:45.76 So a lot of times I don't like to talk about this kind of thing because it's by the time this comes out
01:26:45.76 --> 01:26:50.20 It'll be you by the time you're listening to this might be over don't care anymore
01:26:50.20 --> 01:26:57.36 But there is a a principle here a concept behind this that does make sense to try and discuss so people can
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.04 Learn and improve and something for me to think about my game
01:27:02.32 --> 01:27:06.000 So you got this guy who's a really good striker going against a guy who's a
01:27:07.04 --> 01:27:12.52 Pretty good striker himself very good. Yeah, very good and that's one of the things that this is
01:27:12.52 --> 01:27:21.60 This is the question the way it sets it up as if jiu-jitsu is the is the only thing that Nate Diaz is better at
01:27:22.60 --> 01:27:28.08 That might not necessarily be the truth and in fact in their first fight it was the striking
01:27:29.08 --> 01:27:34.32 Of Nate Diaz that forced Conor McGregor to shoot a sloppy take down
01:27:34.80 --> 01:27:39.64 Take it to ground and once you got on the ground the jiu-jitsu from ADS was just way too much for
01:27:39.64 --> 01:27:43.92 For McGregor so this question
01:27:46.24 --> 01:27:54.64 It's almost a little bit off because the question shouldn't be that there's just a jiu-jitsu disparity the question should be
01:27:55.56 --> 01:27:58.56 You know what is how would you make up for the fighting
01:27:59.36 --> 01:28:03.04 Disparity or maybe not even that it's how would you go against what would you tell Connor?
01:28:03.04 --> 01:28:08.40 What would you work on? Yeah, what's the strategy? So let's just look at as an overall strategic question
01:28:08.40 --> 01:28:13.16 You got a guy that's pretty that's what what what is he good at that's the question
01:28:13.16 --> 01:28:15.16 What is he good at one of the strengths of Conor McGregor?
01:28:15.32 --> 01:28:22.78 He's fast he's strong, but strong might not even come to play because our Diaz walking on a 200 pounds right now
01:28:22.78 --> 01:28:27.88 The fight no 170 so he's gonna just call it a lot of way. He's gonna be big and strong. He's gonna be a better shape for this fight
01:28:30.76 --> 01:28:35.64 Conor is pretty good with some unorthodox stuff his striking is fast and
01:28:35.64 --> 01:28:43.52 Fairly dynamic so those are the things that he has going form what is Nate Diaz have going form his jiu-jitsu is really good
01:28:45.80 --> 01:28:48.92 Yeah, I'm just a jujitsu sec his
01:28:49.92 --> 01:28:53.36 Striking is especially his boxing is not a big kicker
01:28:54.24 --> 01:28:55.60 so
01:28:55.60 --> 01:29:01.44 If I was if I was McGregor here's what I'd be doing I mean what I'd be working my wrestling we work my underhoax of course
01:29:01.44 --> 01:29:06.44 and in getting control and getting back to my feet
01:29:06.92 --> 01:29:11.000 When I get taken down you immediately getting back to my feet
01:29:11.40 --> 01:29:14.84 The way I would fight if I was Conor McGregor is I would
01:29:16.28 --> 01:29:20.36 Back off with the hard punches. I would throw a lot of really fast
01:29:21.04 --> 01:29:25.000 Light punches and I'd move around a lot and just try and touch and go
01:29:25.24 --> 01:29:28.20 That's what I do if I was Conor McGregor
01:29:28.20 --> 01:29:34.52 I would possibly start in the middle of the second round maybe into the third round five round fight
01:29:34.52 --> 01:29:36.04 I might start throwing some leg kicks
01:29:36.44 --> 01:29:38.44 He doesn't
01:29:38.44 --> 01:29:43.36 Nate sometimes doesn't even check leg kicks, so maybe you can start putting on herding on him if you if you throw enough of those
01:29:44.96 --> 01:29:48.72 But in jujitsu wise, I would teach him to disengage
01:29:49.96 --> 01:29:54.04 disengage because you don't want to get go you don't want to get in the U to loop
01:29:55.08 --> 01:29:57.08 with the heat that
01:29:57.08 --> 01:30:04.20 McGregor does not want to get into a loop situation with with DS because he can't keep up with him
01:30:04.60 --> 01:30:06.60 He'll be he'll be changing
01:30:06.60 --> 01:30:12.12 He'll be going to the next thing going to the next thing going to the next thing and Conor McGregor will be going to get copy-hined and he'll
01:30:13.20 --> 01:30:19.04 won't be able to do it. So I teach him to get no now one thing that does make you just a little bit harder if you're if you're you're an iron to injuditzer
01:30:20.04 --> 01:30:25.12 And you're goal you're not you you actually disengage for me and you're just like your whole goal
01:30:25.12 --> 01:30:27.12 If we were on the mat shook hands
01:30:27.52 --> 01:30:32.60 Slap bump and we're gonna roll and all you did try to do is stay away from me. It would be a really hard round for me
01:30:32.60 --> 01:30:39.04 It would be harder than if you attacked me. Yeah, it's harder than if you attacked me and when I did take you down
01:30:39.04 --> 01:30:43.88 All you did was try and get back up. You didn't try and close a guardian trying to attack me with any submissions
01:30:43.88 --> 01:30:47.44 You just try to get back up and get away from me. That is a much harder round for me
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.28 Then if you actually come at me with your full board jujitsu
01:30:51.28 --> 01:30:54.92 Right because then it's jujitsu versus jujitsu and I have an advantage
01:30:55.92 --> 01:31:04.64 But if it's jujitsu of mine versus run away from you now I got to run after you now. It's it's a more fair fight
01:31:05.84 --> 01:31:11.72 So that's what that's what McGregor needs to do he needs to use his speed and his
01:31:14.08 --> 01:31:20.52 Yeah, use his speed and then I think that's his biggest advantage the other thing that I find about
01:31:20.52 --> 01:31:29.04 The DS brothers that I wish that I could I wish they I wish they would not train so much triathlon and train more explosive
01:31:29.04 --> 01:31:33.20 I wish he was a little bit stronger both Nate and neck. I mean those guys are awesome and
01:31:33.88 --> 01:31:40.24 They're they're great fighters, but they've they really train had they do they do literally do triathlons
01:31:40.24 --> 01:31:44.88 And so you're not getting explosive muscles now it shows that they have great cardio
01:31:44.88 --> 01:31:49.92 But I'd rather just they were a little bit more explosive. That's that's my personal opinion
01:31:51.76 --> 01:31:59.60 Yeah, I dig it I have no advice. I think Nate is so well rounded in this quest as far as this matchup goes
01:32:00.88 --> 01:32:02.88 I
01:32:02.88 --> 01:32:09.88 Like just like that first fight yeah the first fight though you watch the first round. It's not it's not a pushover
01:32:09.88 --> 01:32:13.28 It's gonna be a tough fight man. Yeah. That's an end. That's not what I'm saying
01:32:13.28 --> 01:32:18.48 And I'm saying it's for you know you know how like you know you attack the weaker points
01:32:18.72 --> 01:32:23.20 Right, you know like let's say I'm a way better striker than one guy and his duty to his way better than mine
01:32:23.20 --> 01:32:28.68 I can stay on you know it's obvious that's where I'm gonna talk but in this case, it's not like that. So I'm not yeah
01:32:28.68 --> 01:32:30.68 I don't know man
01:32:30.68 --> 01:32:36.04 It's helpful. It's a tough fight for it for Connor. I stopped fight for for Nate to me
01:32:36.04 --> 01:32:37.64 There were some
01:32:37.64 --> 01:32:41.92 Yeah, yeah, we wasn't even the ending of the fight was very lobstided
01:32:41.92 --> 01:32:48.24 Right the first round it was a little closer and I think Connor thought he had magic
01:32:49.36 --> 01:32:52.80 Yeah, I thought that some of it he even said in a post-flight press conference. He said
01:32:53.44 --> 01:32:56.88 You know he was the big a man and and I
01:32:57.92 --> 01:33:03.44 I hit him with everything I got most of those would stop a smaller man. Yeah, they didn't stop him and I think that's got to be
01:33:04.28 --> 01:33:06.88 That's got to be hard. Yeah, I think that got to him psychologically
01:33:06.88 --> 01:33:13.34 So if he's prepared for that psychological this time maybe he'll be able to stick with a game plan and not shoot
01:33:13.34 --> 01:33:18.08 Yeah, on him which was ridiculous yeah, and even the shoot it wasn't just like hey
01:33:18.08 --> 01:33:19.98 I'm gonna decide to shoot it was kind of like a
01:33:21.36 --> 01:33:27.58 Ditch effort yeah, kind of kind of rock to and now you shoot you're rocked and you have to content with Nate
01:33:27.58 --> 01:33:30.72 Diaz, you do so it's like it's not just I gotta continue with Nate
01:33:30.72 --> 01:33:35.16 You do you do to which is bad enough by the way, but you're rocked and it was like a desperation thing
01:33:35.16 --> 01:33:40.76 You got to deal with it then you get that so it seemed like oh so quick, but it was like it was just a bunch of compounding factors
01:33:40.76 --> 01:33:45.08 And culminated in that the joke didn't work out looking forward to watching that. Yeah
01:33:45.64 --> 01:33:50.32 All right, great next question. Joko like you many leaders began as rebels
01:33:52.92 --> 01:33:55.76 Joko's the rep. I'll tell you about his band
01:33:56.68 --> 01:34:02.12 One day how did you learn to see the game? Yeah, man that Elgin told you about
01:34:02.12 --> 01:34:04.12 Yeah, man
01:34:04.12 --> 01:34:06.12 And then you told me about you
01:34:06.12 --> 01:34:08.12 How did you learn to see the game and
01:34:09.32 --> 01:34:11.72 Are rule followers at a disadvantage?
01:34:13.24 --> 01:34:15.24 Okay, so yeah, I was a
01:34:16.12 --> 01:34:18.12 Rebellious youth
01:34:18.92 --> 01:34:21.56 And you know when I got in the suit teams
01:34:21.56 --> 01:34:27.80 I was kind of a rebel rebel rebel as well and as a matter of fact if you think about it from a certain perspective
01:34:28.44 --> 01:34:33.72 Being in special operations, especially when I came in being in special operations is almost the
01:34:33.72 --> 01:34:39.32 Form of rebellion in its own right because you're saying look the regular stuff. We'll do the regular stuff right?
01:34:39.32 --> 01:34:41.32 I'll do the other stuff
01:34:41.88 --> 01:34:43.88 so
01:34:43.96 --> 01:34:47.56 That was my attitude. You know, I thought all regular navy now
01:34:48.36 --> 01:34:53.40 I'm doing this you know, so that was my rebellion and and and like I've explained before
01:34:53.80 --> 01:34:59.40 Joining the military I grew up in in New England not a lot of not a huge military proponent up there
01:34:59.40 --> 01:35:06.36 And so that was it was almost rebellious thing and matter of fact it wasn't rebellious thing for me to join the military in the first place
01:35:06.36 --> 01:35:08.12 So these are the kind of things that were
01:35:08.68 --> 01:35:12.92 rebellious and yes, we were we were my buddies and me were
01:35:13.16 --> 01:35:15.16 Rebellious with some rebellious
01:35:16.60 --> 01:35:18.60 Rock and roll bands back in the day
01:35:19.80 --> 01:35:21.80 so
01:35:22.28 --> 01:35:25.32 When I got to the seal teams we actually were
01:35:25.32 --> 01:35:29.08 I kind of maintained that you know like we're gonna be hardcore me
01:35:29.80 --> 01:35:35.24 Maybe there wasn't rebel, but we were we were like outsiders, you know, we were like going hard and
01:35:35.96 --> 01:35:42.04 The group of guys I was with when the guys I went through seal training with and went to seal team one with me back in the day
01:35:45.16 --> 01:35:49.16 You know, we we were getting effort we were pushing hard we were
01:35:49.16 --> 01:35:55.80 You know being hardcore and I actually got told to stand down a few times for doing stuff that was
01:35:57.16 --> 01:35:59.16 a little bit too hard core
01:35:59.96 --> 01:36:05.96 And it's a matter of fact so you get these evaluations in the in the navy when I first got in the navy
01:36:06.52 --> 01:36:11.80 They had this old evaluation system where you had 15 things you were getting evaluated on and
01:36:11.80 --> 01:36:18.36 And everybody it it had been um in inflation so high as grade you could get is a 4.0
01:36:19.32 --> 01:36:24.60 So if there was inflation on the grades at the time and so everyone just put 4.0 for everything
01:36:25.64 --> 01:36:32.04 Pretty much and I actually I have this I actually saved this evaluation of me, but I got a 3.8
01:36:32.68 --> 01:36:34.04 3.8
01:36:34.04 --> 01:36:37.64 in team building and the guy that gave it to me
01:36:38.76 --> 01:36:39.72 said
01:36:39.72 --> 01:36:43.72 You know you're just you're just too hard on people that are unsat
01:36:46.76 --> 01:36:51.64 Which I actually he was one of the guys that I was like you know hard on yeah, I was hard on
01:36:51.64 --> 01:36:52.76 Never-for-for-for
01:36:52.76 --> 01:36:58.04 So and unsat I used to use that word all the time yeah sat around ceremony that these
01:36:58.04 --> 01:37:01.40 Yeah, so that was sort of you know we were we were
01:37:01.40 --> 01:37:05.72 Rebelling by being super hardcore I guess you could say but then
01:37:05.72 --> 01:37:12.68 Even though I was rebellious and again that's a strong word I don't know if that's the word we were
01:37:13.56 --> 01:37:15.56 It's I don't know if that's the perfect word
01:37:16.20 --> 01:37:21.72 But I did I love the seal teams right so and and in working for some of the great guys that I work for I
01:37:21.72 --> 01:37:26.84 Realize that if you want to impact the teams which I want to do because I did love teams
01:37:26.84 --> 01:37:29.56 Then you got to try again to some kind of leadership position you know
01:37:30.20 --> 01:37:34.60 These guys that I respected that I worked for so did wait that guy controls this platoon
01:37:34.60 --> 01:37:38.36 I want to do that he's helping us he's making that's good so
01:37:39.16 --> 01:37:41.16 Can like that old quote that
01:37:42.44 --> 01:37:50.20 The best former revenge is success it's almost like the best form of rebellion is success and so
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.96 That's what I kind of went for to a situation. I was trying to first situation where I could move forward and kind of bring this hey
01:37:58.36 --> 01:38:00.60 I got this now this my platoon
01:38:00.60 --> 01:38:02.92 You know so I I guess that was a little bit of a
01:38:02.92 --> 01:38:05.56 There's a little bit simplified but but
01:38:06.68 --> 01:38:10.20 You know I don't want again. I don't want to make it sound like I was some kind of crazy rebel in the seal teams
01:38:10.20 --> 01:38:12.20 I wasn't I was I was
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.04 Into the seal teams I was into doing the right thing and and
01:38:17.16 --> 01:38:18.68 I wanted to
01:38:18.68 --> 01:38:22.20 Do the do my best in the seal team so I guess that's not really being rebellious at all
01:38:22.52 --> 01:38:29.48 But I did still have some of that rebel mindset and one of the things I think is beneficial about having a rebel mindset is
01:38:29.48 --> 01:38:37.24 You question things right you question things you're not allowed to you're I was never afraid to say no or I don't agree with that
01:38:37.24 --> 01:38:39.32 I was never afraid to be contrarian or something
01:38:39.32 --> 01:38:46.04 I was never afraid to hold the line and take criticism so that goes even if if you're in a group of rebels
01:38:47.48 --> 01:38:49.72 And you go against them who's the rebel now?
01:38:50.52 --> 01:38:55.64 Well you are so when guys were beyond out of certain path I would I'd be okay
01:38:55.64 --> 01:38:57.16 Hold in the line against them because
01:38:57.16 --> 01:39:02.28 I was okay with being an outsider. I guess that's the word I've been looking for like an outsider
01:39:02.28 --> 01:39:03.80 Someone's not quite
01:39:03.80 --> 01:39:09.08 Just following and and doing whatever and also doing I've always been okay with being an outsider
01:39:09.08 --> 01:39:11.08 So maybe it's not necessarily a rebel
01:39:12.12 --> 01:39:18.84 But being an outsider and like okay those guys are doing it that way. No, I don't agree with that and I'm okay being over here by myself
01:39:19.96 --> 01:39:25.56 Marching to my own drum for lack of a better word. It's kind of like only if you need to be kind of thing
01:39:25.56 --> 01:39:27.56 Right
01:39:27.56 --> 01:39:32.12 What do you mean like if everyone's doing the right thing you're gonna do with that sure and you're gonna you know go hard
01:39:32.44 --> 01:39:38.60 You know the way you do but yeah, you're not just like this follow the following line, you know and I never
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.28 I would say that's something and so if we categorize that as
01:39:42.84 --> 01:39:49.96 Being rebellious then yes, I kind of I would more categorize it with being comfortable with being an outsider
01:39:50.28 --> 01:39:51.08 Yeah
01:39:51.08 --> 01:39:57.16 comfortable with my own decision making process so and not always I mean there's times where I did things
01:39:57.16 --> 01:40:00.60 It was you know I was younger you're not that's another thing when um
01:40:02.28 --> 01:40:09.08 You know you hear me talk on 44 years old right I spent my whole adult life in the sealed teams
01:40:09.08 --> 01:40:14.84 I didn't show up in the sealed teams with like this incredible leadership capability
01:40:14.84 --> 01:40:21.48 I learned this stuff. I'm learning still learning I'm still learning this stuff. I picked up off along the way
01:40:21.48 --> 01:40:27.32 So I don't want people to ever think that you know I was a superstar
01:40:28.68 --> 01:40:33.48 Yeah, wasn't you know, I'm still not I'm just I have an open mind
01:40:33.48 --> 01:40:40.28 But now I can look back yeah, and I was lucky enough to have some great jobs and some great experiences that opened a lot of
01:40:40.28 --> 01:40:42.28 I
01:40:42.28 --> 01:40:49.72 It showed me it. I learned a lot. I had an open mind and the world taught me a lot stuff and so
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.20 Yeah, but it wasn't wasn't just like hey, I was
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000 Showed up there but I
01:40:57.40 --> 01:41:00.44 Would say this the lead people that are out there that are leaders
01:41:01.48 --> 01:41:06.84 Keep the level alive keep alive keep under control
01:41:06.84 --> 01:41:11.48 Yeah, and maybe you don't let the rebel talk to other people
01:41:12.36 --> 01:41:13.32 Right?
01:41:13.32 --> 01:41:20.68 Maybe and I've had a seal buddies that do this where there there rebellious is there as outsider or whatever the word we're using as I am
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.24 But they just can't keep it inside so they're verbalizing it and they're and what are they doing they're making enemies?
01:41:26.28 --> 01:41:28.28 They're making
01:41:28.04 --> 01:41:30.04 They're they're antagonizing people
01:41:30.04 --> 01:41:33.08 They're doing that. I never did that because I'm playing the game
01:41:33.08 --> 01:41:37.48 I'm gonna win the long term strategic goal so don't let the rebel
01:41:38.52 --> 01:41:39.80 Be the one that
01:41:39.80 --> 01:41:41.80 Represents you and talks and open your mouth
01:41:42.52 --> 01:41:43.80 But
01:41:43.80 --> 01:41:45.80 Let him whisper in your ear
01:41:45.80 --> 01:41:47.80 In listen
01:41:47.80 --> 01:41:51.80 Yeah, I talked about it. I talked to my wife a lot about the difference
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.64 There's the difference between what you think or what you feel or whatever and what how you behave
01:41:57.96 --> 01:41:59.72 So like you can
01:41:59.72 --> 01:42:03.40 If you I don't know you get cut off in traffic or something
01:42:05.72 --> 01:42:09.56 No one's gonna be mad at you if you're like mad at that or that irritates you or whatever
01:42:09.88 --> 01:42:16.12 But if you start flipping the guy off or or violating traffic logical chase somewhere do you know start behaving
01:42:16.68 --> 01:42:22.28 Because he cut you behaving in a certain way then that's wrong. So there's a difference you can feel like all kinds of stuff
01:42:23.40 --> 01:42:27.08 But once you start misbehaving that's when the violations come up
01:42:27.08 --> 01:42:33.72 Yeah, basically what you're saying. I don't don't let him control your judge yourself. Yeah, you're behavior mind control
01:42:38.60 --> 01:42:41.64 Yeah, they're like just being a rebel typically that's like
01:42:42.20 --> 01:42:46.68 Hey, all these rules that everyone's following. I'm gonna. I rebel against those rules
01:42:46.68 --> 01:42:50.68 But here's the thing some of those rules are good rules exactly so you can't just be a rebel to
01:42:50.68 --> 01:42:56.60 Unable Lincoln statement. Yeah, I'm a rebel and that's why that's why it was kind of pulling back on that word
01:42:56.60 --> 01:43:02.92 Yeah, it makes me sound like I was big rebel. I was not I was I I loved being in the teams
01:43:04.12 --> 01:43:10.12 So why would I rebel against it? Yeah the people I rebel against were the guys that were not good seals
01:43:10.92 --> 01:43:14.84 We were about against them like I told you we had a mupe that was a rebellion
01:43:14.84 --> 01:43:20.92 That was a straight rebellion. Yeah, how to real legit mutiny and when against our cleaning are our platoon commander
01:43:20.92 --> 01:43:27.88 Mm-hmm and said hey to this commanding officer said no, I don't want this guy anymore. That's that's a rebel. Yeah, we were about but then again
01:43:28.28 --> 01:43:31.40 Everyone in my platoon was with me so we all were about so then was I a rebel?
01:43:31.40 --> 01:43:35.56 I don't know yeah, and does that make you a rebel just because you rebel don't on time
01:43:36.44 --> 01:43:38.20 You know yeah
01:43:38.20 --> 01:43:42.68 I get think we didn't see much semantics or a hundred and a semantics kind of part of
01:43:44.04 --> 01:43:46.76 Let's not go there. All right next question
01:43:46.76 --> 01:43:55.24 Question jockel how do you deal with the leader who preaches ownership but does not practice ownership?
01:43:56.12 --> 01:43:58.12 Oh, dream
01:43:58.52 --> 01:44:03.96 The leader who preaches ownership but does not practice ownership you know what I do in those situations
01:44:04.28 --> 01:44:08.76 I take ownership myself and I work for all kinds of bosses
01:44:09.48 --> 01:44:11.96 That didn't want to take ownership and you know what I did
01:44:11.96 --> 01:44:18.12 Take ownership. I took ownership. Do you work for a boss that doesn't want to lead you know what I did?
01:44:19.08 --> 01:44:21.08 Lead
01:44:21.64 --> 01:44:23.40 If
01:44:23.40 --> 01:44:27.88 For in my mind if a boss doesn't step up or doesn't take ownership they're not a
01:44:28.60 --> 01:44:30.60 problem
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000 They're an opportunity
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.04 They're an opportunity to an opportunity for me to step up if you're not if you're my leader and you're not giving me instruction
01:44:38.04 --> 01:44:42.12 You're not stepping up and leaving guess what I'm gonna run with it. I'm gonna run
01:44:42.12 --> 01:44:45.24 I'm gonna take control. I'm gonna take command. I'm gonna make things happen and
01:44:46.12 --> 01:44:48.12 You're either gonna
01:44:48.12 --> 01:44:54.04 You're either gonna see what I'm doing and say wow he's taking ownership. I need to step up or
01:44:56.20 --> 01:44:58.20 If he doesn't have any potential at all
01:44:59.24 --> 01:45:01.24 then maybe he looks at it and says
01:45:03.80 --> 01:45:07.88 You know what I'm maybe I'm not fit for this or maybe they don't realize it's happening
01:45:07.88 --> 01:45:11.56 You'll not take it their job from them because other people will eventually realize
01:45:12.84 --> 01:45:15.24 Now the thing that you have to be careful of
01:45:16.84 --> 01:45:20.04 Is if you say oh he's not leading I'm gonna lead
01:45:20.68 --> 01:45:26.76 That your ego starts saying I'm gonna lead her and then you flaunt it and now you might make your boss think that you're
01:45:26.76 --> 01:45:28.76 Gunning for their job
01:45:28.76 --> 01:45:30.28 Hmm
01:45:30.28 --> 01:45:33.40 And then we can have some issues because now we might shut you down
01:45:33.40 --> 01:45:38.68 You know there's all kinds of things that negative things that can happen there so when you take ownership
01:45:38.68 --> 01:45:41.80 You gotta make sure you're putting your ego in check and make sure that you're taking ownership
01:45:41.80 --> 01:45:45.000 But you're still giving them the credit that's the hardest thing to do but it works
01:45:45.32 --> 01:45:49.48 I'm telling you I promise you that works if you take ownership, but then you give them the credit like
01:45:49.48 --> 01:45:52.92 Hey sir, you know, I just want to go through this thing right here. Here's what I did yesterday
01:45:53.40 --> 01:45:58.20 Based on you know the guidance that you gave us the guidance giving you guidance. Please make it up
01:45:59.64 --> 01:46:01.64 Just make it up
01:46:01.64 --> 01:46:06.52 These you know here we go and you just do your best to make him look good
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.40 Eventually you're gonna win so if you got some of that's not leading that's not stepping up. That's not taking ownership
01:46:11.40 --> 01:46:13.40 Just do it yourself
01:46:13.40 --> 01:46:15.40 Do it in a tactful manner
01:46:15.80 --> 01:46:17.56 Do it in a
01:46:17.56 --> 01:46:20.04 non-ego flare-up manner
01:46:21.24 --> 01:46:23.24 But do it make it happen
01:46:23.24 --> 01:46:25.24 Get after
01:46:25.24 --> 01:46:29.40 Yeah, if you keep that goal in a hall like when you're on a team right you have a
01:46:29.40 --> 01:46:35.24 Some objectives and it's probably just just a handful of them typically if not just one close with the destroy the enemy
01:46:35.24 --> 01:46:42.52 Yep, yeah, make the ceiling you know, whatever the goal is if you keep the goal in mine then you as long as you like really keep it in mine
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.96 You you can avoid all the because if you're like okay
01:46:45.96 --> 01:46:53.24 I'm gonna step up just like I already say I'm gonna step up and lead and then if you're goal shifts from the main goal that you guys all have to
01:46:53.96 --> 01:46:57.56 Now my new goal is to be the leader that's my goal to be the leader then
01:46:57.56 --> 01:46:59.56 Out comes the ego because
01:47:00.68 --> 01:47:05.56 The being the leader that's what your focus on. I'm the leader of the follow-up kind of thing
01:47:06.12 --> 01:47:09.48 Keep the goal in mine you're gonna do basically with your ownership
01:47:09.48 --> 01:47:13.96 You're gonna do your part and then some if someone's not doing you know certain things or whatever
01:47:13.96 --> 01:47:19.72 You're gonna take the lead you're gonna do your job in it to achieve the goal therefore pulling everybody ahead
01:47:20.84 --> 01:47:26.60 So we're gonna keep that keep that goal in mine there. Yes indeed do it for the goal not for yourself
01:47:26.60 --> 01:47:28.60 Yeah
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.60 Good
01:47:30.60 --> 01:47:32.60 Jockel
01:47:32.76 --> 01:47:39.88 Something I would be very interested in listening to you discuss is the art of disarming people with words
01:47:42.52 --> 01:47:48.76 Yeah, and good question. How do we how do we disarm people and
01:47:50.60 --> 01:47:55.56 Good thing tonight. We talked about maneuver warfare because we already know that we're not gonna attack the strong point
01:47:55.56 --> 01:47:59.40 We're gonna look for the gaps. We're gonna look for the weaknesses. We're gonna look for the openings
01:47:59.72 --> 01:48:03.80 So what does that mean that means if we're dealing with someone that has a big ego
01:48:04.36 --> 01:48:09.16 We're gonna side step that we might even throw some compliments out there might be saying echo
01:48:09.32 --> 01:48:15.000 You're so good at doing this right here. I could use some help doing that now we're getting around as ego
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.04 Now we can start getting into his head if the person's over aggressive
01:48:18.04 --> 01:48:22.76 Maybe you just have to be a little bit more accepting of them. Maybe if they're nervous you got to just reassure them
01:48:22.76 --> 01:48:24.76 They're hostile
01:48:24.76 --> 01:48:33.08 Be just be open-minded to what they're saying so there's a lot of ways that disarm and impact some tactical things that you could literally like
01:48:33.64 --> 01:48:34.68 It says
01:48:34.68 --> 01:48:38.68 Disarm people with words, so what are words that disarm people? I'll give you a couple
01:48:39.56 --> 01:48:41.56 That's a good idea
01:48:41.56 --> 01:48:49.16 Oh, okay, or yeah, that actually makes good that that's good sense right there. That makes sense right? Disarmed or
01:48:49.16 --> 01:48:56.04 Oh, yeah, I like that disarmed right all free those little easy phrase. That's a good idea that makes sense
01:48:56.36 --> 01:49:00.60 You know, I like that those are all things that are gonna disarm somebody a little bit and
01:49:02.84 --> 01:49:05.56 Once you disarm them they're gonna they're gonna
01:49:06.92 --> 01:49:09.72 Open up they're gonna open up a little bit so so like
01:49:12.04 --> 01:49:14.04 Once you
01:49:14.04 --> 01:49:20.28 You're gonna have you once you get them disarmed by just opening your mind given a little compliment
01:49:20.28 --> 01:49:26.28 Tell them that you like whether they're coming with coming from and then you start to probe and trying to figure out what's going on
01:49:26.28 --> 01:49:30.68 And instead of being direct right we want to use the indirect method here so
01:49:31.24 --> 01:49:33.24 You know ask questions
01:49:34.20 --> 01:49:38.28 Say hey echo could you explain to me what what the what we're trying to get done here?
01:49:38.28 --> 01:49:42.92 That's a lot different than what are you trying to do here?
01:49:43.32 --> 01:49:49.88 That's an attack almost what the hell are you thinking what the hell were you thinking hey could you explain to me this because I'm not sure I understood
01:49:49.88 --> 01:49:51.88 I didn't really see everything here or
01:49:52.60 --> 01:49:54.20 Hey, I'm having trouble
01:49:54.36 --> 01:49:58.36 Understanding this can you can you help me because I'm not sure I don't think I get this
01:49:59.16 --> 01:50:05.32 So now when I say that to you you in order to explain something you have to actually open up you have to say okay
01:50:05.32 --> 01:50:10.28 I'll find I'll tell you well as soon as you say that now you're open up right now you're open up and when you open yourself up
01:50:11.08 --> 01:50:13.08 When you open yourself up verbally
01:50:13.80 --> 01:50:18.60 With an idea to explain an idea that you're open yourself up mentally too because now we're having a discussion
01:50:19.64 --> 01:50:22.12 Make happen so it's pretty easy
01:50:23.64 --> 01:50:27.40 I shouldn't say it's pretty easy if you think about it and you just think about
01:50:28.12 --> 01:50:29.64 those simple
01:50:29.64 --> 01:50:37.40 Frases that you can use to disarm people. Hey, it's good idea. I like where you're coming from all the other that that that actually that makes good sense or
01:50:38.84 --> 01:50:43.56 That is the way you disarm somebody very simple. Yeah, and there's little things you can do
01:50:44.52 --> 01:50:50.92 even outside actually outside straight up outside of any specific like scenario
01:50:51.64 --> 01:50:57.48 Where you know some people are just more approachable than other people and then some some people just just aren't
01:50:57.48 --> 01:50:59.48 So what you can do
01:50:59.48 --> 01:51:02.76 And what I've noticed is people that don't talk
01:51:04.44 --> 01:51:08.92 Negatively about people and don't come in just talking negative in general like I knew a guy
01:51:08.92 --> 01:51:15.64 No, I still know him, but I don't see him anymore hardly but every time he'd come in the first thing out of his mouth was something like
01:51:15.64 --> 01:51:21.72 I don't know traffic was bad. It was something bad. You know, he was just complaining about life and it was just a matter of
01:51:22.12 --> 01:51:26.28 What particular thing he chose to complain about, but it was always a complaint everything and
01:51:26.28 --> 01:51:31.48 And another thing he would do is let's say someone would say something. Oh, hey, did you see this or that or whatever?
01:51:31.48 --> 01:51:36.60 This was real cool. He'd be like yeah, but and then say something bad and kind of dump on it, you know
01:51:36.60 --> 01:51:38.68 Yeah, that's true, but you know that kind of stuff. So
01:51:39.48 --> 01:51:43.40 Don't do that so that seems kind of easy, but you'd be surprised where
01:51:44.04 --> 01:51:47.96 Don't be super negative. Yes, don't be don't be a negative person in general
01:51:48.36 --> 01:51:51.72 So right off the bat you'll be kind of one of those guys that's more approachable
01:51:51.88 --> 01:51:53.88 But here's here's one that's harder
01:51:53.88 --> 01:51:58.68 I mean it's simple, but it's it's kind of harder to do because I think it comes kind of natural
01:51:58.68 --> 01:52:02.60 Easy so not easy is don't talk bad about people and
01:52:03.24 --> 01:52:10.28 When people are talking bad about people like to you or around you or whatever don't like jump in and kind of accommodate them
01:52:10.68 --> 01:52:12.28 And I'm not saying
01:52:12.28 --> 01:52:19.000 Reject them or even talk bad about them talking bad about people don't don't do that just don't be one of those people. Yeah, it's the here's the thing it's
01:52:20.12 --> 01:52:22.12 I'm going above and beyond saying
01:52:22.12 --> 01:52:24.12 Don't
01:52:24.12 --> 01:52:28.84 Be you know certain people that's all they do is gospel about people of course. That's a no brainer
01:52:28.84 --> 01:52:36.68 I'm saying never do it try to never do it at any cost never do it if you can because basically you're trying to establish a rep
01:52:37.24 --> 01:52:41.32 Of being this positive approachable person that's what you're trying to do
01:52:41.56 --> 01:52:44.04 So even though people don't take
01:52:44.28 --> 01:52:48.44 Specific mental notes like oh you're talking bad about this person you always talk bad about people
01:52:48.44 --> 01:52:52.76 They feel it so you ever you ever been around somebody who tells
01:52:53.40 --> 01:52:59.000 Tells you secrets every time they see you like am not supposed to tell you this but this and you're like dang this guy's telling me
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.96 You know this cool secrets. I like being around him and not typically white people tell and I'm never gonna tell them in a secret
01:53:03.96 --> 01:53:06.20 That's exactly right so you know
01:53:06.20 --> 01:53:10.28 This guy's talking about about people or this guy's being negative or whatever when it comes to you
01:53:10.28 --> 01:53:15.72 Why why would I want to trust in this guy or talk to this guy about this? Especially for gonna do something together
01:53:15.72 --> 01:53:21.80 You know, so you're kind of coming at it from the other perspective not how would you disarm someone you're just coming at it from how do you
01:53:22.12 --> 01:53:27.64 Be a person that doesn't even need to be disarmed. Yeah, like just yeah exactly so you're so just so
01:53:28.76 --> 01:53:37.68 At the start point. No, no, you're actually right so you're saying if if I know you as a guy that doesn't talk bad and doesn't tell secrets and doesn't
01:53:37.68 --> 01:53:39.88 But then I'm gonna automatically be a little bit
01:53:39.88 --> 01:53:41.88 You're gonna start off a little bit
01:53:41.88 --> 01:53:49.82 So you've developed a relationship with the person. Yeah, with that won't really make that your goal make that your goal. Yeah
01:53:54.84 --> 01:54:01.94 Jocco have you worked with anyone who led from an emotional or unbalanced place
01:54:02.28 --> 01:54:04.28 But learn to detach
01:54:05.56 --> 01:54:07.56 And what help them
01:54:07.56 --> 01:54:13.88 Well when I was putting these questions together obviously here's one where you also have to use a little
01:54:14.16 --> 01:54:22.08 Disarm movement to get someone that's getting emotional about something you gotta get them to calm down. Yeah, so you don't reciprocate the emotion
01:54:23.16 --> 01:54:26.52 Don't coach people when they're angry or emotional
01:54:26.52 --> 01:54:29.56 That's not the time to say hey, you know what you need to do right now is you need to calm down
01:54:29.56 --> 01:54:32.92 Yeah, you know that that does doesn't work actually
01:54:32.92 --> 01:54:42.14 Life was telling that story on the last podcast where he was using losing his temper about something and I just you know stood there and said kind of smiled and said
01:54:43.36 --> 01:54:49.42 I didn't I didn't reciprocate the anchor. I said hey take it easy. You know don't worry about it
01:54:49.42 --> 01:54:55.48 Let's just think about it. Can you make this happen and he's like yeah, I can of course. I actually I had a
01:54:56.40 --> 01:55:02.000 One of my one of my senior and listed advisors actually my first deployment to Iraq and
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.88 And and he and I were old school team one guy send up
01:55:08.16 --> 01:55:14.66 What one of my one of my favorite guys in the world actually, but he would sometimes get a little bit
01:55:14.66 --> 01:55:17.000 Most of a little bit a little bit
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.74 He had this tactic that I picked up from him that I that I understood the way he
01:55:22.56 --> 01:55:24.56 the way he addressed
01:55:25.68 --> 01:55:27.04 conflict
01:55:27.04 --> 01:55:31.92 Was and I broke it down form eventually was simplify and
01:55:32.12 --> 01:55:39.54 Profi and repeat that's what he would do and it actually worked and worked a lot of time on most people and so like first if I said
01:55:40.56 --> 01:55:42.56 Hey
01:55:42.56 --> 01:55:47.90 I'm gonna need it. I want to take a couple more guys on this operation and if he didn't think I needed more guys for an operation
01:55:48.24 --> 01:55:52.60 He'd say well, why don't you just take everyone in the compound? I'll tell you what just take every person on the roster
01:55:52.60 --> 01:55:57.16 We'll give you that'll give you enough people then we'll take everyone. I'll also rounding everyone up right now
01:55:57.16 --> 01:56:01.32 We'll take every single person that we have out there and I'll even grab some army guys on the web
01:56:01.68 --> 01:56:05.92 That was his way and and and I'll be like no man
01:56:05.92 --> 01:56:11.96 No and but I wouldn't do is I wouldn't get defensive. I wouldn't get fired up and I would say
01:56:12.68 --> 01:56:15.40 Hey, no, I'm not saying any of everybody
01:56:15.40 --> 01:56:20.000 I'm just saying I want to take a three more guys there's some spaces in the vehicles that will give us a little more
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:26.16 Ability to contain the target and we look at that say look take a look at the map. We can and so then he
01:56:27.44 --> 01:56:28.64 Calm down
01:56:28.64 --> 01:56:35.02 I mean and in this guy's case he actually wasn't like two emotional. He was just super passionate and when I actually broke down the
01:56:35.80 --> 01:56:38.000 simplify amplifying and intensify
01:56:39.76 --> 01:56:44.52 Oh no, it was simplified amplifying repeat. That's what you do. Simplify amplifying repeat
01:56:44.52 --> 01:56:50.32 When and then when when every we would start getting a discussion and he would start doing it. We would start laughing because
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.66 He realized it has exactly what he was doing so the simple by amplifier repeat. That's that's what the name you put on his little
01:56:56.66 --> 01:56:58.66 That was his methodology
01:56:58.66 --> 01:57:02.24 Yeah, you know if you said like I said if I said I had need a couple more guys
01:57:02.24 --> 01:57:05.24 You take will just take everyone then if that's what you need every single guy
01:57:05.24 --> 01:57:10.72 You're he would simplify what you said he would amplify it and make it more extreme and he would just repeat it
01:57:10.72 --> 01:57:17.84 Yeah, and most people that he did it to they would feel stupid because of what he did to him
01:57:17.84 --> 01:57:22.000 You know he said well, no, I don't need no, I just feel stupid and he said so just
01:57:22.40 --> 01:57:24.40 Ridiculous and he'd win
01:57:26.32 --> 01:57:33.64 But we had we we would laugh about it, but but like I said he wasn't actually too emotional
01:57:35.96 --> 01:57:39.60 He was just fired up about stuff which is a positive thing
01:57:39.60 --> 01:57:45.98 But someone that is actually too emotional so like I said you got to stay calm you don't
01:57:46.72 --> 01:57:55.52 Don't coach people when they're angry you set a good example and then when people come down later you talk to them about
01:57:56.64 --> 01:58:02.84 Like came in that wasn't cool and you got to you got to spin it right because you're trying to get you're trying to you
01:58:02.84 --> 01:58:04.84 Don't want to like literally coach
01:58:04.84 --> 01:58:09.48 Because if I say echo I need to coach you as I'm in your defensive and all that but if I say
01:58:10.48 --> 01:58:12.48 Hey man, I
01:58:12.48 --> 01:58:18.80 Man, I rely on you because of your expertise and I think you're the only guy in the pool tune that can actually make this happen
01:58:18.80 --> 01:58:24.28 So if you're losing your temper man that doesn't all of a sudden I can't count on you and I need you
01:58:25.40 --> 01:58:28.40 Because you know make good I mean we none of us make good decisions if we're all
01:58:28.76 --> 01:58:30.76 Ben out of shape on something
01:58:30.76 --> 01:58:38.44 So I got to please can you just can you help me by just hey man if you start if you start getting angry about something
01:58:38.44 --> 01:58:42.52 Just realize it's gonna affect your decision making and we can't have that man
01:58:42.52 --> 01:58:46.80 We need to come we need to make the good decisions people are count on us and that's
01:58:47.76 --> 01:58:49.16 How I'm
01:58:49.16 --> 01:58:54.84 Handling someone that gets emotional about stuff. Yeah, that that's what it's some simplify repeat one
01:58:55.12 --> 01:58:57.40 But I can simplify
01:58:57.40 --> 01:59:03.76 Every I'm not gonna say all girls do this but some wives might feel like you say
01:59:03.76 --> 01:59:05.76 Lives with the last name Charles
01:59:07.32 --> 01:59:09.32 You know
01:59:09.32 --> 01:59:14.28 Ultimately I think if you know and you're if you're in a good really you don't really take it that seriously
01:59:14.28 --> 01:59:20.38 But but yeah, you say like I don't know you know hey you you were you said something mean to me or whatever
01:59:20.38 --> 01:59:25.60 No, we'll then why do marry me then why don't you just you know you they take it to the to that next level
01:59:25.60 --> 01:59:30.56 I am provide repeat. Oh, yeah, or watch out for that. We're hey go to this one time long time
01:59:30.56 --> 01:59:31.56 We were first cut
01:59:31.56 --> 01:59:33.56 She's a she said
01:59:33.88 --> 01:59:38.84 She won me to get orange juice. I went to the store's going to start wanting me to get orange juice for whatever reason
01:59:38.84 --> 01:59:43.20 I forgot the orange juice. I didn't choose not to get orange juice forgot just forgot
01:59:45.32 --> 01:59:49.000 You know you come home for get the orange juice. She said something along the lines of
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.92 Does anything I say have any importance to you at all?
01:59:53.92 --> 01:59:56.32 That's that's what that is right
01:59:56.32 --> 02:00:01.20 I provide and all she needs to do is say it more than once and you got the repeat as well
02:00:01.20 --> 02:00:07.04 Yeah, yeah, so I mean I guess to answer that question. No. Yeah, most things are pretty important
02:00:07.04 --> 02:00:11.36 I mean maybe not the orange juice at that moment. You know I forgot
02:00:12.80 --> 02:00:18.06 Another tactic like when you talk to people like to calm them down or whatever like let's say something they lose their temporal
02:00:18.06 --> 02:00:24.46 The camera something like that and you have to address like them losing their tempered be like hey, you know how you use the word passionate passionate
02:00:24.46 --> 02:00:29.66 Is it basically like an excuse word for someone being like you know people like it's a fashion in
02:00:29.66 --> 02:00:32.66 Compassionate you can be it can be you can be you
02:00:32.66 --> 02:00:38.70 Well here's the thing being passionate and being emotional are two different things because you can be passionate about something
02:00:38.70 --> 02:00:41.14 And not lose your temper and not being in one of their two different things
02:00:41.22 --> 02:00:44.46 So people will be like they'll put that on and so it sounds kind of acceptable
02:00:44.46 --> 02:00:49.14 Simply not true, but so if you if the but you can use that to your advantage
02:00:49.14 --> 02:00:53.90 You can be like hey, I know you're passionate. I dig it man. It's one of the things I like about you
02:00:54.54 --> 02:00:58.44 And another thing that I like about you is that you're also a thinker
02:00:58.82 --> 02:01:01.46 That's why oh, and you say what to do
02:01:01.46 --> 02:01:03.14 That's what you go work there
02:01:03.78 --> 02:01:04.78 Ninja mine
02:01:04.78 --> 02:01:11.30 The key line there is that's what I like about you or what I like about you is this and then they kind of take on that role
02:01:11.30 --> 02:01:19.10 For sure, you're disarming them yeah, yeah, yeah, there you go very good very good next question
02:01:20.78 --> 02:01:27.26 Duckle what do you think of the saying you get more bees with honey?
02:01:27.26 --> 02:01:29.26 They actually asked to leave this to but
02:01:31.38 --> 02:01:34.38 You get more bees with honey I
02:01:34.38 --> 02:01:41.26 Was I always I always actually heard you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
02:01:41.26 --> 02:01:47.66 But to say my idea and it's something I agree with I mean obviously this comes down to the our word relationships and
02:01:48.90 --> 02:01:54.02 Always what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to build the relationship so I'm gonna put out the honey
02:01:54.70 --> 02:02:00.38 You know, I'm gonna put out the honey the carrot is is is preferable to the stick
02:02:00.38 --> 02:02:05.22 Yeah, yeah, yeah, which is another way of saying that the reward the good stuff the
02:02:06.30 --> 02:02:11.58 So so yeah totally that that absolutely works better um now you can
02:02:13.22 --> 02:02:15.22 Give people too much honey
02:02:15.22 --> 02:02:18.22 And now they get type two diabetes
02:02:19.18 --> 02:02:24.82 They get lazy they get out of shape and they don't work anymore, right?
02:02:24.82 --> 02:02:31.30 So you can't you got to do that's that's the that's the dichotomy that you need to balance as leader not being too hard
02:02:31.30 --> 02:02:34.66 But not being too soft not being too aggressive but being aggressive enough
02:02:36.70 --> 02:02:41.34 That's the dichotomy, but the bottom line is you need to treat people well
02:02:41.98 --> 02:02:44.62 That's what you need to do you need to
02:02:45.34 --> 02:02:48.78 Not spoil them but give them respect in
02:02:49.34 --> 02:02:51.34 Build the relationships and
02:02:51.34 --> 02:02:56.50 If you make that your goal when I work with all these different companies
02:02:57.82 --> 02:03:03.90 You know, I'm I'm gonna say listen make your goal with this person that you're having a problem with make your goal to build a relationship
02:03:04.18 --> 02:03:06.18 That make that your goal
02:03:06.70 --> 02:03:12.58 When they say something negative say something positive when they want to blame something on you say yeah
02:03:12.58 --> 02:03:17.26 You're right. It's my fault build a relationship with the person that's gonna strengthen the team
02:03:17.26 --> 02:03:22.46 It's gonna be thousand times infinitely better than having an antagonistic relationship with somebody
02:03:25.30 --> 02:03:27.30 So
02:03:27.30 --> 02:03:29.30 And also
02:03:29.30 --> 02:03:32.10 You know when you're leading with vinegar when you're leading with fear and
02:03:32.98 --> 02:03:38.18 You're leading with your you're beating people with a stick that doesn't not work out good and the long run
02:03:38.18 --> 02:03:42.06 Do you have to have consequences sometimes? Yeah, but
02:03:42.06 --> 02:03:48.98 The team that is following somebody because they want to do their best for that leader is gonna beat the team
02:03:48.98 --> 02:03:51.62 That is doing things only because they're scared of the leader
02:03:51.78 --> 02:03:57.14 Right, yeah, they're trying to avoid the stick that's gonna be where they operate in
02:03:57.14 --> 02:04:01.66 You're gonna operate enough to avoid the sticks. Yeah, cuz really that's the goal to avoid the stick
02:04:01.66 --> 02:04:04.42 There's no honey really above and beyond yeah
02:04:04.42 --> 02:04:06.94 I think you said something very wise in office space
02:04:07.34 --> 02:04:09.34 What is he saying?
02:04:09.34 --> 02:04:14.46 Review he got hypnotized did you watch office space I've watched it a million times so so he gets hypnotized
02:04:14.46 --> 02:04:18.10 All right, so now he tells the truth or he doesn't care you know about things
02:04:18.10 --> 02:04:23.54 So he's like he's real opening on as he goes into his little review which is supposed to be this kind of tense thing and they say
02:04:25.14 --> 02:04:29.98 Like what's up, you know something that I asked some stuff and he's like it's a problem of motivation
02:04:30.58 --> 02:04:35.38 Like we're you know we're not if I get you know all this he's always explained it to and then he's like okay
02:04:35.38 --> 02:04:40.42 If I'm if I'm scared of you know whatever this punishment from my boss whatever no I'm just gonna work hard
02:04:40.42 --> 02:04:43.62 Enough not to get fired and but that's true. That's absolutely true
02:04:44.42 --> 02:04:47.42 So yeah, like these kids who only get scolded, you know
02:04:47.74 --> 02:04:54.22 They don't get like compassion and and compliment and support you know they only get scolded a lot of times
02:04:55.10 --> 02:05:01.74 I mean there's a lot more to it, but a lot of times they're just gonna do the minimum and clearly to not get scolded too far together direction
02:05:01.74 --> 02:05:10.26 We get spoiled you know and the dangerous part about getting giving to like going to front of the direction
02:05:10.26 --> 02:05:15.22 How you put it is you don't prepare them like they wind up when they're on their own
02:05:15.66 --> 02:05:18.98 Like they're not prepared for like like the tough parts
02:05:18.98 --> 02:05:23.38 Yeah, yeah, and there's a lot of good parts in life, man, but those tough parts there there too
02:05:23.38 --> 02:05:25.14 So if you're not prepared for me, you're gonna get jacked
02:05:26.10 --> 02:05:28.10 Relaxing the better term
02:05:28.10 --> 02:05:30.10 You got to correct term actually
02:05:30.10 --> 02:05:32.10 You know I last question
02:05:34.30 --> 02:05:43.58 Juckle great topic for me would be staying committed to life change. I start strong and fade fast into old habits
02:05:44.10 --> 02:05:53.34 Please help I'm gonna have to bring in the little Shakespeare on this one
02:05:53.34 --> 02:06:01.58 Shakespeare between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion
02:06:02.70 --> 02:06:08.90 All the interim is like a fantastic or a hideous dream
02:06:11.26 --> 02:06:13.26 And that's
02:06:13.26 --> 02:06:15.26 Brutus
02:06:15.58 --> 02:06:20.40 From Julius Caesar and Brutus in the play is plotting to kill
02:06:20.40 --> 02:06:22.40 So Caesar
02:06:23.52 --> 02:06:26.32 Someone he was loyal to
02:06:28.24 --> 02:06:33.24 And Shakespeare the master of understanding human nature
02:06:34.56 --> 02:06:37.56 He captures what that feels like
02:06:39.20 --> 02:06:44.08 And here's what these lines mean between the acting of a dreadful thing
02:06:44.32 --> 02:06:46.96 So that's the moment that
02:06:46.96 --> 02:06:51.36 That moment when you're waiting to do something that you don't want to do
02:06:53.44 --> 02:06:59.04 And the first motion, so that's when you actually start doing that thing that you don't want to do
02:07:01.04 --> 02:07:03.04 All the interim
02:07:03.68 --> 02:07:07.52 Now this is all that time all that time in that moment
02:07:08.32 --> 02:07:10.32 While you are waiting to take action
02:07:10.32 --> 02:07:17.44 Is like a fantasma or a hideous dream
02:07:20.24 --> 02:07:22.24 So that moment
02:07:22.72 --> 02:07:27.68 That moment when you're waiting to do something it's like an apparition a
02:07:28.80 --> 02:07:30.80 hideous dream a nightmare
02:07:33.36 --> 02:07:36.08 And so the battle this struggle
02:07:36.08 --> 02:07:40.08 It takes place in that moment
02:07:43.20 --> 02:07:45.20 It's not
02:07:45.44 --> 02:07:50.000 Knowing what to do that's not the battle. It's not actually doing it
02:07:51.20 --> 02:07:54.000 That's not the battle. It's the moment in between
02:07:55.44 --> 02:07:57.44 It's the hesitation
02:07:58.80 --> 02:08:00.80 hesitation is the enemy
02:08:00.80 --> 02:08:04.80 and in war
02:08:07.04 --> 02:08:11.28 Understanding where the enemy is allows you to defeat him
02:08:13.84 --> 02:08:16.64 And this is where the enemy of action
02:08:17.44 --> 02:08:25.44 The enemy of commitment the enemy of change that's where the enemy lies in the waiting
02:08:25.44 --> 02:08:27.44 and
02:08:30.56 --> 02:08:33.36 And all you have to do to win
02:08:34.40 --> 02:08:38.40 is overcome that moment the waiting the hesitation
02:08:40.48 --> 02:08:42.88 All you have to do is go
02:08:44.48 --> 02:08:46.000 Move
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.76 Take action
02:08:47.76 --> 02:08:50.88 Get out of bed get your feet on the ground
02:08:50.88 --> 02:08:55.60 Step into the gym put down the donut and pick up the kettlebell
02:08:58.80 --> 02:09:02.80 Do not hesitate do not wait go forward
02:09:04.32 --> 02:09:06.32 Go to war
02:09:07.36 --> 02:09:09.36 And win
02:09:11.92 --> 02:09:13.92 Every
02:09:13.92 --> 02:09:15.92 single
02:09:15.92 --> 02:09:17.92 All right
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000 And I think that's
02:09:23.12 --> 02:09:25.12 All of got for the night
02:09:27.20 --> 02:09:30.72 Thanks to everybody out there for listening and for all the
02:09:32.80 --> 02:09:37.12 Awesome continued support or get from everybody if you want to keep supporting
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000 Echo how they do that
02:09:41.68 --> 02:09:43.68 Well, primarily
02:09:43.68 --> 02:09:45.68 I
02:09:45.68 --> 02:09:47.84 Would say support yourself with supplementation
02:09:48.56 --> 02:09:53.28 Because really that's really what it's about not necessarily does supplementation but supporting yourself as well
02:09:53.28 --> 02:09:56.80 It's kind of like when you when you fly in the airplane
02:09:57.20 --> 02:10:02.56 Yeah, you know you got to put the mask over your self first before you you help your instinct yeah, yeah
02:10:02.56 --> 02:10:05.92 Because if you're not dope like you you know, you know what I mean?
02:10:05.92 --> 02:10:08.08 So anyway if you need supplements
02:10:08.08 --> 02:10:13.92 Go to on it dot com slash jockel get 10% off on its supplements. What does that mean?
02:10:15.52 --> 02:10:18.32 That's the best supplements like any guy 10% off
02:10:19.60 --> 02:10:24.32 I could explain whether so good, but you can go on the website read it just trust me. It's only supplements
02:10:24.88 --> 02:10:27.68 I take in you to right yes and be or you take something else
02:10:28.56 --> 02:10:30.56 Don't buy them
02:10:31.36 --> 02:10:33.36 Or you can support buy
02:10:33.36 --> 02:10:38.16 clicking through before you do Amazon shopping click through the website or just get the trooper tool
02:10:38.16 --> 02:10:39.36 I think that would be a lot easier
02:10:39.52 --> 02:10:44.56 So you're going to website get the troop tools called jockel podcast trooper tool chrome extension click on it
02:10:44.96 --> 02:10:49.12 Boom confirm boom it's on there any time you shop at Amazon you support passively
02:10:50.32 --> 02:10:52.80 This podcast and you're kind of official
02:10:53.60 --> 02:10:57.36 That's dope. I don't like the word pass over even though I know it's the correct term
02:10:57.36 --> 02:11:04.56 Because when you are shop that's that's a really good easy way to support the podcast. Yeah, so I don't
02:11:05.28 --> 02:11:11.76 agree with you on the past yeah, I like passing they're actively shopping actively getting after it
02:11:12.80 --> 02:11:14.80 Passively supporting I did
02:11:16.72 --> 02:11:23.28 They actively went to the website they actively installed the tool or they click through their taking action
02:11:23.28 --> 02:11:31.12 They're making things happen. Yep, and it's efficient to give credit and official anyway nonetheless. That's a way and

02:15:40.16 --> 02:15:43.92 Well, I shouldn't say small usually usually usually white teas about a third of a cup of coffee
02:15:44.88 --> 02:15:48.96 So it's pre-mile on the caffeine. Yeah, it's like a micro dose of caffeine
02:15:49.28 --> 02:15:51.92 There's maybe oxins in there and it tastes good
02:15:55.04 --> 02:15:57.04 And so anyway, as I got approached about

02:16:52.64 --> 02:16:57.36 Make it a point not to send you stuff that's like not relevant because you sometimes

02:18:41.36 --> 02:18:43.36 Oh
02:18:42.88 --> 02:18:50.40 Who does that why would you why is that I'm not gonna send any name marketing? I don't know is that considered to be good marketing? Somebody must be telling people to do that
02:18:51.84 --> 02:18:55.44 I don't know you know what that's that's that's what I don't want to do
02:18:56.88 --> 02:18:58.88 Is market things
02:18:58.88 --> 02:19:04.32 Yeah, okay, that's the thing if anybody out there thinks I'm marketing things stop me
02:19:05.36 --> 02:19:06.64 Do it well
02:19:06.64 --> 02:19:13.92 I did understand lately there's a difference between advertising and marketing so marketing is everything like if even you wearing that shirt
02:19:14.32 --> 02:19:15.12 That's
02:19:15.12 --> 02:19:19.68 Technique marketing for advertising okay. Well the other hand right busted
02:19:20.72 --> 02:19:22.32 I don't want to get into a big thing here
02:19:22.72 --> 02:19:28.88 I was talking to them. Well I guess within we market and we advertise for no we market don't have forever ties
02:19:29.36 --> 02:19:31.36 We don't
02:19:31.36 --> 02:19:39.60 No, okay, what about when I say what about when you say hey on it has good stuff and I say yeah get the curloil that's on it
02:19:40.64 --> 02:19:42.80 Technically okay, I'm I'm
02:19:42.88 --> 02:19:48.96 We're in the advertising well what I don't want to do is beat people down with you know by this by that
02:19:48.96 --> 02:19:50.96 I don't want to do that. Yeah
02:19:50.96 --> 02:19:56.56 On it is actually supporting the podcast and I support on it that's Joe Rogan's company and
02:19:56.56 --> 02:20:02.96 And Joe Rogan's a great guy who helped us out who what by the way we're sitting here because of Joe Rogan
02:20:03.52 --> 02:20:04.48 FYI
02:20:04.48 --> 02:20:07.52 All right the other way. Hey also you got the
02:20:08.08 --> 02:20:10.08 You can buy a little book called Extreme Ownership
02:20:10.64 --> 02:20:17.36 Britain by myself and my brother, Dave Babin who was on the last podcast podcast 34 he was also on podcast 11
02:20:18.72 --> 02:20:20.08 And we wrote a book
02:20:20.08 --> 02:20:23.84 It's about leadership. It's about war. It's about business. It's about life
02:20:23.84 --> 02:20:27.92 And it's available in hard-covered digital audio format both
02:20:29.04 --> 02:20:32.08 Life and I reread the sections that we wrote so that's cool
02:20:32.80 --> 02:20:38.32 And you know what's cool is get it for yourself, which is cool. It'll help you but then help you team
02:20:38.72 --> 02:20:43.76 Grab them a copy and you're helping us you know a little bit. Yeah, it's for support because
02:20:43.76 --> 02:20:49.36 Think good about that book. I said this before but it's it's worth saying again is that you know all like some
02:20:49.36 --> 02:20:53.28 Books is like okay. I'm an imp you know improve and and
02:20:54.08 --> 02:20:57.60 Whatever. I'm gonna read this book. It's just helped me in this way or that way or whatever
02:20:57.76 --> 02:21:02.16 But this is like the kind stuff where you can literally turn on that like right when you read a certain sentence
02:21:02.16 --> 02:21:06.88 And it's giving you whatever you know whatever this advice is whichever one it is but the Extreme Ownership will say
02:21:07.12 --> 02:21:12.40 You can turn it on right then and there like right then and there you can walk away and you have to read the whole book technically and
02:21:13.20 --> 02:21:18.96 It'll you're already be changed. That's all you just gotta do it. I'm saying like not all books
02:21:18.96 --> 02:21:21.92 You're like that it's like oh yeah, it's a gradual process
02:21:22.48 --> 02:21:25.76 That is awesome. But anyway, that's that's a big takeaway I got from it now
02:21:27.28 --> 02:21:33.92 As always if you want to let us know what's going on in your world you're gonna continue this little talk that we're having amongst us
02:21:35.04 --> 02:21:37.04 What are up in the webs?
02:21:37.84 --> 02:21:42.40 Twitter Facebookie and Instagram echo is at echo Charles
02:21:42.40 --> 02:21:48.88 And I am at juggle willing now one of the things that I've made a note here to talk about a little bit
02:21:49.60 --> 02:21:53.76 Gotta gotta come clean here gotta address something
02:21:55.28 --> 02:21:57.28 Went on a little
02:21:57.28 --> 02:22:02.24 Trip into the bush was out of contact before I left on the trip
02:22:05.68 --> 02:22:07.68 I
02:22:07.92 --> 02:22:11.04 Stopped I didn't stop but I could no longer keep up
02:22:11.04 --> 02:22:17.04 Couldn't no longer keep up with responding there was a time there all up until
02:22:19.04 --> 02:22:22.32 A week ago maybe maybe a week and a half ago
02:22:23.04 --> 02:22:29.36 I committed and responded to every single person that hit me on Twitter a hundred percent
02:22:30.80 --> 02:22:32.80 And I kept
02:22:32.80 --> 02:22:40.48 Trying to maintain and I told everyone I'm remain tame and I maintain for a long time for what six months seven months something like that
02:22:41.12 --> 02:22:46.64 But I cannot maintain anymore. I cannot respond to every single person
02:22:47.60 --> 02:22:51.76 And especially coming back from being in the field for
02:22:52.32 --> 02:22:57.36 You know seven days where I didn't have it or I have it very sparingly
02:22:57.36 --> 02:23:03.20 I'm getting thousands of tweets a day which is awesome and you know what I do read them all
02:23:03.76 --> 02:23:07.36 I absolutely read them all but to respond every single one of them
02:23:07.36 --> 02:23:13.20 I don't I don't have time starting about a week and a half ago. I just said nine I can't do this because
02:23:14.40 --> 02:23:19.04 First of all we went to the whole thing of like oh we're gonna go two times a week for the podcast or the one time
02:23:19.44 --> 02:23:22.000 Two times a month for the podcast maybe one ever two weeks
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.52 Most people didn't like that. I didn't like that. I want to come and get it on so
02:23:28.16 --> 02:23:34.000 But well and and I used to be able to respond to the Twitter in like 45 minutes a day which I find that time
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.48 I'll make that time then it was an hour then it was an hour and ten minutes and all of a sudden it became
02:23:38.88 --> 02:23:44.40 Two hours a day and then if think about this if I missed a day for whatever reason
02:23:44.80 --> 02:23:48.72 One missed a day and a half five hours finally one Sunday
02:23:48.72 --> 02:23:52.96 I sat down and I did Twitter for a
02:23:53.76 --> 02:23:57.36 Stupid amount of time you know six something hours and
02:23:58.48 --> 02:24:00.48 Twitter's a great method of communication
02:24:01.52 --> 02:24:03.52 but
02:24:03.52 --> 02:24:11.60 I got to be more selective and disciplined about my time management. I don't want to carry this on even further, but
02:24:11.60 --> 02:24:18.96 There is an um kind of like kind of laughing is that because you're kind of new to social media
02:24:19.52 --> 02:24:22.24 So kind of but it's funny because like you're
02:24:23.84 --> 02:24:29.04 This is gonna sound strange but you're that like nice of a person that you're like
02:24:29.84 --> 02:24:32.08 Telling everyone like we know
02:24:32.48 --> 02:24:36.48 You know you can't just find everybody right but you're like really bothered by you like guy
02:24:36.48 --> 02:24:40.48 I can't I'm not being rude. I'm not being rude. That's what's fun. That's what's funny
02:24:40.48 --> 02:24:44.96 Because from your perspective, it's like it's like someone's talking to you for real and you're just like
02:24:45.36 --> 02:24:49.60 Basically putting your finger up saying I don't you know, I don't have time for you. Yeah, but
02:24:50.16 --> 02:24:55.60 Anything we are kind of a group a team right? Yeah, which makes it even yeah
02:24:55.60 --> 02:25:01.36 of which I'm sort of like the guy that facilitates the communication between us from almost a leadership position
02:25:01.68 --> 02:25:04.32 And so for now people and you know what was funny because uh
02:25:04.32 --> 02:25:09.84 One of one of the troopers guy in Brandon who's been it in the games since day one. I forget how he
02:25:11.12 --> 02:25:14.80 I think I think you listen to Tim Ferriss Bar and he immediately like followed me on Twitter and
02:25:16.56 --> 02:25:20.32 We were going back and forth on a bunch of stuff and and finally we were emailing about some stuff
02:25:20.32 --> 02:25:22.32 We were emailing about uh
02:25:22.72 --> 02:25:24.72 He was he was trying to get timex
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.60 To sponsor
02:25:27.60 --> 02:25:31.76 Yeah, the podcast or me or something because timex is selling watches
02:25:32.16 --> 02:25:33.68 factually
02:25:33.68 --> 02:25:38.24 The a lot of people have bought timex iron man matches watches
02:25:38.72 --> 02:25:44.24 People from your things just from from wanting to get in the game, you know, oh yeah, that's cool man. Let's do it
02:25:45.04 --> 02:25:51.36 You know and so a lot of people have factually bought those watches and so Brandon trooper was like hey
02:25:51.36 --> 02:25:54.64 You know what I'm gonna contact these guys so we went back on a bunch of emails
02:25:55.20 --> 02:25:57.20 I have pictures
02:25:57.20 --> 02:25:58.72 of me
02:25:58.72 --> 02:26:02.24 With this watch on with this timex watch that you see on my Twitter feed
02:26:02.24 --> 02:26:11.12 Not the exact same watch, but the same model watch the same model and I have I think five of them right now and actually
02:26:11.60 --> 02:26:16.08 Some troopers sent me other older because you can't buy him anymore
02:26:16.40 --> 02:26:20.08 So I have I have enough of these watches to last me for the rest of my life
02:26:20.48 --> 02:26:22.48 You know, I think it's about five or six
02:26:23.36 --> 02:26:28.000 And I've actually done surgery on these watches over the years like like things yeah
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.84 Like one would break a certain part so I had taken another one apart and I put the insights and you know
02:26:31.84 --> 02:26:38.08 So one day I was reading an email from Brandon because we emailed back and forth on this a couple times and then the other day
02:26:38.08 --> 02:26:39.92 He emailed me just said hey just so you know
02:26:40.32 --> 02:26:44.96 I haven't given up on them still on timex and I said I'm an email and I was reading it on the way here
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000 to record
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.28 and
02:26:49.28 --> 02:26:50.80 And I was looking through the email
02:26:51.52 --> 02:26:54.16 When I parked I saw his phone number at the bottom
02:26:54.16 --> 02:27:01.36 And I just hit you know it's iPhone I hit I hit the thing you're Nicole and I said
02:27:01.92 --> 02:27:04.16 And he's okay, this is Brandon and I said hey, what's up, man?
02:27:04.16 --> 02:27:06.96 It's so cool he's like really yeah, man, what's going on?
02:27:07.36 --> 02:27:13.36 I was one of the touch-based and he's and so I said so we started talking and this was right as the social media
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.36 I was reaching the kind of the end of the line of social media
02:27:18.48 --> 02:27:21.68 And as I'm sort of thinking about how I'm gonna
02:27:21.68 --> 02:27:27.28 Manage and how I'm gonna like if I could tell people like listen, I'm sorry I just can't
02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000 I physically can't do it
02:27:31.76 --> 02:27:37.12 And one of the things he says to me while we're talking he goes you know what's so awesome is that you respond to everybody
02:27:39.12 --> 02:27:41.12 So I stuck with it
02:27:41.12 --> 02:27:46.88 Okay, you know what I'm behind him and he's sit down and I think that's when I did like a Sunday where I just sat there like an idiot
02:27:47.12 --> 02:27:50.16 You know what I know but it just boom boom boom boom
02:27:50.16 --> 02:27:54.08 Yeah, and I think it's too slow people are telling me good stuff and I'm like, why I say hey, man
02:27:54.08 --> 02:27:56.40 I think that's good point. Oh, that's a good book. I'm gonna check that out
02:27:57.04 --> 02:28:03.36 So we need to tell me that I said okay, and hold the line. I hold the line press and then and then I realize if I'm gonna hold the line on that
02:28:03.92 --> 02:28:06.80 I'm gonna let go of more important things one of them being the podcast
02:28:07.44 --> 02:28:11.04 Yeah, one of them being the podcast and not putting forth quality podcast which to me is
02:28:11.52 --> 02:28:18.72 the most important thing that that I'm doing right now is is getting the podcast quality from a podcast perspective, right
02:28:18.72 --> 02:28:19.76 Sure
02:28:19.76 --> 02:28:23.92 Um, so yeah, there's my uh, there's my social media adventures
02:28:23.92 --> 02:28:31.92 No, yeah, what it's funny to think of it from your perspective because I would argue. Oh, yes that from everyone else's perspective
02:28:32.16 --> 02:28:33.92 It's like yeah, no
02:28:33.92 --> 02:28:40.64 No kidding. Yeah, yeah, you're here. He's getting but not man good and you really you're the yeah, I think that's that's cool
02:28:41.20 --> 02:28:46.24 Well apologize everybody, but uh, and I'm I'm still I'm telling you I'm still like reading them
02:28:46.24 --> 02:28:50.40 But it's I can't respond there
02:28:51.44 --> 02:28:58.40 Got you the man but what I'm gonna try and do since I don't have to be sweating the the more responses if I treat
02:28:58.40 --> 02:29:04.96 I'm gonna try and like do be a little bit more active as things happen cool things happen whatever yeah, we'll see how that works out
02:29:06.96 --> 02:29:08.96 All right
