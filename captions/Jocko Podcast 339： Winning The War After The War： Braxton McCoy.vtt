00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jocopotcast number 339 with echo Charles and me, Jocopo-Willink, good evening echo.

2
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:07.000
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.50 --> 00:00:15.000
I woke face down in blood soaked sand.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.50
The world spun around me.

5
00:00:17.50 --> 00:00:21.50
What little sounds I could make were muffled and indistinct.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.50
It was like I had been twirled around on old tires, swing,

7
00:00:25.50 --> 00:00:27.50
then flung into a swimming pool.

8
00:00:27.50 --> 00:00:30.50
I couldn't gather my wits anymore, then I could get my bearings.

9
00:00:30.50 --> 00:00:33.50
The harder I tried to get a handle on the world around me,

10
00:00:33.50 --> 00:00:36.50
the more slippery my grip became.

11
00:00:36.50 --> 00:00:38.50
My eyes strained to adjust to the scene.

12
00:00:38.50 --> 00:00:41.50
Pain sunk its fangs permanently.

13
00:00:42.50 --> 00:00:44.50
We have just been hit by rockets I assume.

14
00:00:45.50 --> 00:00:47.50
This must be a coordinated attack.

15
00:00:47.50 --> 00:00:49.50
My confusion turned to panic.

16
00:00:49.50 --> 00:00:51.50
Oh God, oh God, please God,

17
00:00:52.50 --> 00:00:55.50
the sounds that surrounded me became clearer.

18
00:00:55.50 --> 00:00:58.000
I could decipher some individual words,

19
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but they seemed only to add uncertainty.

20
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Who is groaning?

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I heard gurgling as someone tried to force air through a blood filled throat.

22
00:01:06.50 --> 00:01:11.000
The wounded and dying were bellowing in both English and Arabic.

23
00:01:12.50 --> 00:01:14.50
Screams of death filled the air.

24
00:01:15.50 --> 00:01:17.50
Rage filled our hearts.

25
00:01:17.50 --> 00:01:20.50
Medic, medic, all the walk bar.

26
00:01:20.50 --> 00:01:24.50
I brought myself up as much as I could.

27
00:01:25.50 --> 00:01:30.50
The intro to that I was able to manage was not enough to make a significant difference in my field of view.

28
00:01:32.50 --> 00:01:34.50
I thought I heard the reports of rifles.

29
00:01:34.50 --> 00:01:35.50
Is that AK fire?

30
00:01:35.50 --> 00:01:37.50
I need to start helping my guys.

31
00:01:37.50 --> 00:01:38.50
I fought to myself.

32
00:01:38.50 --> 00:01:39.50
We're being ambushed.

33
00:01:41.50 --> 00:01:43.50
Shock was setting in.

34
00:01:43.50 --> 00:01:46.50
I desperately tried to locate my weapon and return fire,

35
00:01:46.50 --> 00:01:48.50
but I was totally unable to move.

36
00:01:48.50 --> 00:01:54.50
I wanted to figure out why, but I couldn't get my body positioned in a way that would allow me to look toward my legs.

37
00:01:55.50 --> 00:01:57.50
I could see both of my arms and my chest.

38
00:01:57.50 --> 00:01:59.50
My arms were definitely broken.

39
00:01:59.50 --> 00:02:03.50
Osmosis was spreading blood throughout the sleeves of my uniform,

40
00:02:03.50 --> 00:02:06.50
but I could still move them sort of.

41
00:02:08.50 --> 00:02:12.50
I brought myself up again onto my side and peered down toward my legs.

42
00:02:12.50 --> 00:02:16.50
But when I finally looked downward in the direction that my legs should have been,

43
00:02:16.50 --> 00:02:21.50
all I could make out was thick, black, blood, and a pile of muddy entrails.

44
00:02:23.50 --> 00:02:24.50
I'm cutting too.

45
00:02:24.50 --> 00:02:29.50
I set a loud, unsure whether I was talking to the dying men around me or to myself.

46
00:02:30.50 --> 00:02:34.50
I ran a bit of organ through the fingertips of my left hand.

47
00:02:34.50 --> 00:02:37.50
I was certain that it once belonged to me.

48
00:02:37.50 --> 00:02:39.50
Where did it fit in this mess?

49
00:02:39.50 --> 00:02:43.50
I searched the jumbled human remains that rested underneath me

50
00:02:43.50 --> 00:02:48.50
and wondered exactly where this little organ went, but I couldn't complete the puzzle.

51
00:02:50.50 --> 00:02:52.50
My mind drifted.

52
00:02:52.50 --> 00:02:57.50
Distractedly, I wondered what was going to be like to die.

53
00:02:58.50 --> 00:03:02.50
Certainly there would be no way to save a man who had been cut in half.

54
00:03:04.50 --> 00:03:08.50
Oh God, oh God, oh God, the screams filled my ears again.

55
00:03:08.50 --> 00:03:09.50
I'm hit.

56
00:03:09.50 --> 00:03:11.50
Johnny, medic!

57
00:03:11.50 --> 00:03:14.50
Was that me yelling, I wondered?

58
00:03:14.50 --> 00:03:19.50
I tried to look for the frantic American voice, but all I could see was dark red sand.

59
00:03:19.50 --> 00:03:24.50
Lims which had been flung from their torso's bloody men writhing on the ground,

60
00:03:24.50 --> 00:03:29.50
begging for death to end their suffering, and hundreds of empty sandals.

61
00:03:31.50 --> 00:03:37.50
Lying there, still rubbing that piece of what I believed to be a pancreas between the tips of my fingers.

62
00:03:37.50 --> 00:03:41.50
I again contemplated what was going to be like to die.

63
00:03:43.50 --> 00:03:49.50
Was I going to cross over into some other dimension and meet Jesus like I had been taught my entire life?

64
00:03:50.50 --> 00:03:56.50
Or was it all just going to go black, like slipping quietly into a slumber?

65
00:03:57.50 --> 00:04:00.50
A sleep that one never comes back from.

66
00:04:01.50 --> 00:04:05.50
Please, don't let this be my final resting place I thought.

67
00:04:05.50 --> 00:04:08.50
Not this shithole.

68
00:04:09.50 --> 00:04:10.50
Not now.

69
00:04:16.50 --> 00:04:27.50
And that right there is an excerpt from a book that is called The Glass Factory, written by Braxton McCoy.

70
00:04:28.50 --> 00:04:34.50
And the shithole that he was referring to was a shithole that I'm familiar with,

71
00:04:34.50 --> 00:04:40.50
a place called Ramadi Iraq, and the title of the book, The Glass Factory,

72
00:04:40.50 --> 00:04:45.50
is a title that anyone who served in Ramadi instantly knows.

73
00:04:46.50 --> 00:04:51.50
And I have talked about the glass factory on this podcast a couple times.

74
00:04:51.50 --> 00:04:54.50
I've talked about it on the unraveling podcast as well.

75
00:04:55.50 --> 00:05:00.50
The glass factory was the place of a horrific attack,

76
00:05:00.50 --> 00:05:05.50
where suicide bombers detonated themselves at a police recruiting event,

77
00:05:06.50 --> 00:05:10.50
killing over 50 Iraqi police recruits,

78
00:05:11.50 --> 00:05:13.50
and also two Americans.

79
00:05:19.50 --> 00:05:23.50
The Americans that were killed, Lieutenant Colonel Michael McLaughlin,

80
00:05:23.50 --> 00:05:30.50
of Mercer Pennsylvania, and Sergeant Adam Can from Davy, Florida.

81
00:05:31.50 --> 00:05:37.50
And there were scores of wounded Iraqis and Americans as well.

82
00:05:38.50 --> 00:05:40.50
Many of them severely wounded.

83
00:05:40.50 --> 00:05:49.50
One of them was a young soldier, who's also the author of this book, Braxton McCoy.

84
00:05:49.50 --> 00:05:54.50
And it is an honor to have Braxton here with us tonight

85
00:05:54.50 --> 00:05:58.50
to talk about his experiences in war,

86
00:05:58.50 --> 00:06:04.50
and perhaps more important, his lessons learned after the war,

87
00:06:05.50 --> 00:06:10.50
and how he followed the path toward the truth.

88
00:06:11.50 --> 00:06:14.50
Braxton, thanks for joining us, man.

89
00:06:14.50 --> 00:06:15.50
Thanks for having me, Jalco.

90
00:06:15.50 --> 00:06:22.50
Great to meet you, and I know you sent us this book a while ago, years ago.

91
00:06:23.50 --> 00:06:28.50
And somehow I get sent hundreds of books actually,

92
00:06:29.50 --> 00:06:33.50
and I just slipped past my radar and it wasn't until I was on Twitter,

93
00:06:34.50 --> 00:06:39.50
and I think someone tagged you and me and said,

94
00:06:40.50 --> 00:06:43.50
hey, Jalco was just talking about the glass factory on the podcast.

95
00:06:43.50 --> 00:06:46.50
And you came back and said something like,

96
00:06:47.50 --> 00:06:51.50
he got it mostly right, couple errors, which, you know, of course,

97
00:06:52.50 --> 00:06:54.50
I said, minor errors though.

98
00:06:55.50 --> 00:06:59.50
But, you know, of course, I know I'm not going to know everything.

99
00:07:00.50 --> 00:07:03.50
I don't ever claim to know everything, but as soon as I saw you had a book called The Glass Factory,

100
00:07:04.50 --> 00:07:08.50
that you were wounded there, you know, I said, hey, man, you said,

101
00:07:08.50 --> 00:07:11.50
you know, you said, hey, do you want this book? And I said, absolutely.

102
00:07:12.50 --> 00:07:15.50
And let's talk about it on the podcast. So here you are, man.

103
00:07:16.50 --> 00:07:17.50
Thanks for coming down.

104
00:07:18.50 --> 00:07:20.50
Yeah, thank you. It's really kind of crazy to be here.

105
00:07:21.50 --> 00:07:23.50
And you read my book is kind of weird.

106
00:07:24.50 --> 00:07:25.50
Man, it's a great book.

107
00:07:26.50 --> 00:07:30.50
And I should start off by saying this, you never know what you're going to get when you read a book.

108
00:07:30.50 --> 00:07:47.50
And I think one thing that one thing that you can measure a book by is how vulnerable someone is willing to be in order to convey what happened to them.

109
00:07:48.50 --> 00:07:50.50
And this book is raw.

110
00:07:51.50 --> 00:07:55.50
And you talk about things in this book that I know had to be hard as hell to write.

111
00:07:56.50 --> 00:07:59.50
And that's one of the things that make it so powerful.

112
00:07:59.50 --> 00:08:03.50
And the other thing that makes it so powerful, even though, look, it's a book.

113
00:08:04.50 --> 00:08:07.50
Definitely there's a chunk of it that has to do with war.

114
00:08:08.50 --> 00:08:12.50
And there's a chunk of it that has to do with the struggles after the war.

115
00:08:13.50 --> 00:08:24.50
But the most powerful part of the book is you figuring out how you needed to live in a proper way.

116
00:08:24.50 --> 00:08:28.50
And it's just an epic book.

117
00:08:29.50 --> 00:08:30.50
It's an outstanding book.

118
00:08:31.50 --> 00:08:34.50
And so anybody that is listening right now jump on there.

119
00:08:35.50 --> 00:08:39.50
We'll have it on our website and go go buy this book immediately.

120
00:08:40.50 --> 00:08:41.50
We're going to read some of it today.

121
00:08:42.50 --> 00:08:43.50
There's no way I could read the whole book.

122
00:08:44.50 --> 00:08:45.50
I know that you're working on an audio book right now.

123
00:08:46.50 --> 00:08:47.50
So eventually you'll be able to buy that.

124
00:08:48.50 --> 00:08:51.50
But you know, actually never mind the audio book for now.

125
00:08:51.50 --> 00:08:54.50
The cover of the book is awesome.

126
00:08:55.50 --> 00:08:56.50
And what's the deal with the cover?

127
00:08:57.50 --> 00:08:58.50
I read a little bit about the cover of the book.

128
00:08:59.50 --> 00:08:59.50
But where did come from?

129
00:09:00.50 --> 00:09:01.50
The guy who designed it was a medic there.

130
00:09:02.50 --> 00:09:03.50
There was at the glass factory with me.

131
00:09:04.50 --> 00:09:06.50
And we, I told him I wanted it.

132
00:09:07.50 --> 00:09:08.50
I told him I wanted it to be.

133
00:09:09.50 --> 00:09:11.50
Look like the windows, you know, the brass over the windows over there.

134
00:09:12.50 --> 00:09:12.50
And the copper stuff.

135
00:09:13.50 --> 00:09:14.50
But with the, I wanted the buffalo on there.

136
00:09:15.50 --> 00:09:16.50
So he kind of worked it in.

137
00:09:16.50 --> 00:09:23.50
Yeah, so it's a very distinct cover and plus it's well, this version is hard cover.

138
00:09:24.50 --> 00:09:25.50
So there's still hard covers available.

139
00:09:26.50 --> 00:09:28.50
There's like maybe 300 you can get on my website.

140
00:09:29.50 --> 00:09:30.50
Those are as good as God.

141
00:09:31.50 --> 00:09:31.50
Those are as good as God.

142
00:09:32.50 --> 00:09:35.50
Anybody that if you can get one of those 300 get it order what's your website?

143
00:09:36.50 --> 00:09:37.50
So people can write some of code.

144
00:09:38.50 --> 00:09:38.50
Bracks of McCoy dot com.

145
00:09:39.50 --> 00:09:41.50
So there we just sold all those 300 books.

146
00:09:42.50 --> 00:09:43.50
And then the other ones are available on Amazon.

147
00:09:43.50 --> 00:09:45.50
Those are soft cover. I'm assuming.

148
00:09:46.50 --> 00:09:54.50
Yeah, and we actually, you know, without getting goofy political or ask about, we try to work on getting another print run and white paper stock is short on everywhere.

149
00:09:55.50 --> 00:10:02.50
So, or at least publishes that we had before and then we try to use a different published publishing company out of Idaho and they couldn't do a check.

150
00:10:03.50 --> 00:10:06.50
We might have to talk to other publishing companies that other people know like mine.

151
00:10:07.50 --> 00:10:08.50
I figure what we can do.

152
00:10:09.50 --> 00:10:10.50
All right. So

153
00:10:10.50 --> 00:10:14.50
So, again, that is a very interesting book.

154
00:10:15.50 --> 00:10:22.50
And one of the things that's interesting about the book is it basically starts off with the attack on the glass factory.

155
00:10:23.50 --> 00:10:30.50
But and and it doesn't you have flash some flashbacks throughout the book, pertinent flashbacks, but there's no detail.

156
00:10:31.50 --> 00:10:36.50
There's not much detail on how you grew up and probably that's the next book you should write.

157
00:10:36.50 --> 00:10:49.50
Is just some of the experience that that made you who you are, but before you write that book since you're sitting here, let's talk a little bit about, you know, how you did grow up and where you came from and how you ended up being who you are.

158
00:10:50.50 --> 00:10:51.50
So, where did you grow up?

159
00:10:52.50 --> 00:11:00.50
I grew up in, well, I lived before you saw a solid valley started to get expanded. There was a place called the Rose Canyon estates up.

160
00:11:00.50 --> 00:11:11.50
There's a bunch of just small rants and ranchettes up south of Salt Lake. It's now kind of all the same valley, but back then it was like, I don't know 25 miles a town or so, then I'd go to school every morning.

161
00:11:12.50 --> 00:11:19.50
And we had just a little horse operation out there. My mother and father divorced, so my mother married my stepfather when I was four.

162
00:11:20.50 --> 00:11:22.50
And so we were, you know, pretty much been in my life.

163
00:11:23.50 --> 00:11:25.50
So what's going on in the horse ranch?

164
00:11:25.50 --> 00:11:29.50
The boy were you doing? When I was a kid? Yeah, man.

165
00:11:30.50 --> 00:11:48.50
Feeding in water and hitting golf balls and shooting arrows into the haystacks and shooting rabbits and lizards and man, I'd get home from school and get my chores done and go grab a backpack and throw a water bottle in there and get my baby going and just head up in the mountain because there's nobody behind us.

166
00:11:48.50 --> 00:11:54.50
And there's this crics called yellow fork and you can go up yellow fork all the way up and just shoot every bird known now.

167
00:11:55.50 --> 00:11:57.50
I must have smoked 500 wood peckers.

168
00:11:58.50 --> 00:12:09.50
There my grandpa had a thing for song birds. He just loves song birds. And I kind of get it now as I age. I like having them around my place too. So if I got caught shooting song birds, I get big trouble.

169
00:12:10.50 --> 00:12:12.50
But woodpeckers all day all day.

170
00:12:12.50 --> 00:12:24.50
Did you step that having a military experience? No. No, his father's father was a he grew up on ranch in Sipio, Utah, which is where we ended up moving when I was 13.

171
00:12:25.50 --> 00:12:34.50
But he, a right after we were to, I guess, he joined the Navy and ended up at air traffic control or eventually ended up air traffic control out here at top gone.

172
00:12:34.50 --> 00:12:41.50
And then he got out and came home to the ranch and sold it. He said, and they want to do another day of farm work in my life.

173
00:12:42.50 --> 00:12:53.50
And moved up to the city and he was a air traffic control for Delta Airlines or something. I don't know, so I came to Nashville for years and then he ended up moving back after he retired.

174
00:12:54.50 --> 00:12:56.50
And what about your mom? What did she do?

175
00:12:56.50 --> 00:13:04.50
She was, she worked for Siskail as like a food sales rep for a while and then she went to, and to real estate. Now she's real estate broker.

176
00:13:05.50 --> 00:13:11.50
And what, what grandfather, the grandfather that you read about in the book, what primarily, what was his background?

177
00:13:12.50 --> 00:13:19.50
He was a marine and then a plumber. He's a plumber my whole life. Just big time outdoors when he was all, like everything,

178
00:13:19.50 --> 00:13:24.50
everything was on in fishing. I mean, work working just so he could get out and fish with his grandkids mostly.

179
00:13:25.50 --> 00:13:30.50
Dude, I got pictures of me on my two years old and his cow will have the damn dear leg in my hand, and I blocked around here, can't.

180
00:13:31.50 --> 00:13:35.50
Like that was his jam, so that was my mother's dad.

181
00:13:36.50 --> 00:13:39.50
And then you said you moved from one ranch to another ranch when you turned 13.

182
00:13:40.50 --> 00:13:44.50
Yeah, we moved down and we sold, we sold out up there and then moved down the CPO Utah.

183
00:13:44.50 --> 00:13:52.50
And my stepdad had about 40 head of horses down there and yeah, roughly 40 head. And then he's an electrical contractor and he'll make ends meet.

184
00:13:53.50 --> 00:13:58.50
And then the horse market went bust pretty hard back in 20, 2000.

185
00:13:59.50 --> 00:14:02.50
I don't see what was that, 2002 maybe?

186
00:14:03.50 --> 00:14:07.50
I can't remember the first time. Anyway, when they passed the No Kill Bill.

187
00:14:07.50 --> 00:14:15.50
Yeah, I can't remember it's two on two or two on four. And anyway, it hit hard. I mean, there was gear horses on the market for nothing.

188
00:14:16.50 --> 00:14:20.50
People were just taking their horses out and turning them out in the desert and stuff like going live for you.

189
00:14:21.50 --> 00:14:22.50
I mean, those horses just died.

190
00:14:23.50 --> 00:14:23.50
Yeah, no one did what they do.

191
00:14:24.50 --> 00:14:28.50
No, I, the reason I said, oh, yeah, because I read an article about that not too long ago, but how people were just letting their,

192
00:14:29.50 --> 00:14:34.50
I guess they're domesticated horses go, you know, and they're not ready to survive out there.

193
00:14:34.50 --> 00:14:41.50
Well, especially most everybody has gillings and no, no wild horse herd is going to let a gilling in.

194
00:14:42.50 --> 00:14:47.50
I mean, the studs are just going to kill them. It's not a mayor and it's, you know, it's a unique and he doesn't need that around.

195
00:14:48.50 --> 00:14:54.50
So I mean, if you maybe mayors could make it, but even then it's doubtful their hooves are not, there's not bill for anymore.

196
00:14:55.50 --> 00:14:57.50
You know, it's really brother. How does the horse kill another horse?

197
00:14:57.50 --> 00:15:11.50
Of course, they kick, like, so a lot of times they'll break their backs like stud horses, they'll get up on their hind ends like this and flip them break their necks or backs and buy it and kick and I mean, they can kick.

198
00:15:12.50 --> 00:15:16.50
The horse kicks another horse and they had to kill it easy for sure. I don't horse kill one of my cows last fall.

199
00:15:17.50 --> 00:15:20.50
Okay, to at least that's how we can figure out. To cows, find the next day.

200
00:15:21.50 --> 00:15:23.50
So it was horse around there.

201
00:15:23.50 --> 00:15:30.50
So now you were, you were pretty into sports too, right? When you were going, when did you start like wrestling and why don't they sports?

202
00:15:31.50 --> 00:15:34.50
You play. I didn't start wrestling until I was a freshman at high school.

203
00:15:35.50 --> 00:15:40.50
I played baseball growing up, but this in box and my family's friends with Jim Fomers, family friend, our gene Fomers.

204
00:15:41.50 --> 00:15:45.50
So I was a family friend growing up and so to the low, getting punched in head for a bit.

205
00:15:45.50 --> 00:15:56.50
And then I got in, it was, I think there was like a middle school. That's what was. It was a middle school PE, you know, where you'd go through like all the different sports.

206
00:15:57.50 --> 00:16:02.50
So like bad, bad, and then shit like this. And then it was like a wrestling section.

207
00:16:03.50 --> 00:16:05.50
I was like, man, I like this. So we're all compared to bad bit.

208
00:16:06.50 --> 00:16:07.50
Yeah, that's right.

209
00:16:08.50 --> 00:16:12.50
So then my mom signed me up at the tree house with Eve on even off for a while.

210
00:16:12.50 --> 00:16:23.50
That was in Trapear Utah. I was like maybe an hour drive and saw us taking his classes for a bit like cam Jones and some of these other studs from high school wrestling studs and came one risk.

211
00:16:24.50 --> 00:16:29.50
And then then we moved and I went, I don't know, I wrestled that first year at Riverson High School.

212
00:16:30.50 --> 00:16:33.50
And then after that I went, moved down to film more.

213
00:16:34.50 --> 00:16:34.50
Did you still wrestling?

214
00:16:35.50 --> 00:16:36.50
Yeah, I said, yeah.

215
00:16:37.50 --> 00:16:38.50
What year was this? What year did you graduate from?

216
00:16:38.50 --> 00:16:43.50
I was 23, how did you do wrestling and did you make the state or anything?

217
00:16:44.50 --> 00:16:49.50
Yeah, yeah, I won districts my senior year. And then at state, I ended up, I was, man, it sucks.

218
00:16:50.50 --> 00:16:54.50
But I got super sick. I had to drink, I got my wrestling coach.

219
00:16:55.50 --> 00:17:00.50
I just still talk about this all the time. But I was weighing in with a gallon jug of water, trying to get up to weight.

220
00:17:01.50 --> 00:17:04.50
So I was wrestling at 89 and I just was a bar.

221
00:17:04.50 --> 00:17:10.50
I just didn't weigh enough. You know, you got to make the 160 weight. I wasn't making it state. Well, plus two pound lounds.

222
00:17:11.50 --> 00:17:13.50
So I struggled that year.

223
00:17:13.50 --> 00:17:18.50
That's still pretty impressive that you only started wrestling your freshman year and you made it to state your senior year.

224
00:17:19.50 --> 00:17:23.50
Yeah, I'm impressive, man. My junior year, I think I was probably better wrestler.

225
00:17:24.50 --> 00:17:25.50
I got in trouble.

226
00:17:26.50 --> 00:17:27.50
I was coming to it.

227
00:17:28.50 --> 00:17:29.50
And what did you do to get in trouble?

228
00:17:30.50 --> 00:17:32.50
This is where the goods don't work.

229
00:17:32.50 --> 00:17:39.50
I don't want to be bad. So, I got, me and my stepdad got in the fist fight.

230
00:17:40.50 --> 00:17:41.50
And I got kicked out.

231
00:17:42.50 --> 00:17:46.50
We, me and I had butted heads since I was little big time.

232
00:17:47.50 --> 00:17:50.50
And I ended up we got in a pretty good scrap.

233
00:17:51.50 --> 00:17:53.50
And anyway, we couldn't live in the same place as anymore.

234
00:17:54.50 --> 00:17:55.50
So I went to live with my other grandpa on Salt Lake.

235
00:17:56.50 --> 00:17:57.50
And I went back to Riverton that year.

236
00:17:57.50 --> 00:18:00.50
I was like, I was like, I'm just not going to school.

237
00:18:01.50 --> 00:18:04.50
And my dad, my whole life, my biological father was like in and out of jail and stuff.

238
00:18:05.50 --> 00:18:06.50
And in that prison.

239
00:18:07.50 --> 00:18:10.50
So what?

240
00:18:11.50 --> 00:18:12.50
What was he doing?

241
00:18:13.50 --> 00:18:14.50
Man, I don't know.

242
00:18:15.50 --> 00:18:16.50
I get stories.

243
00:18:17.50 --> 00:18:17.50
I don't know what's.

244
00:18:18.50 --> 00:18:19.50
I know at least one thing was a white card thing.

245
00:18:20.50 --> 00:18:21.50
I know there were some violent things.

246
00:18:22.50 --> 00:18:23.50
But I don't know what, you know.

247
00:18:23.50 --> 00:18:26.50
I don't know. I don't know.

248
00:18:27.50 --> 00:18:29.50
So he, he was out for a minute.

249
00:18:30.50 --> 00:18:31.50
And so I was like, well, I'll just live with him then.

250
00:18:32.50 --> 00:18:35.50
And that was about I did that lasted for like, man, he was out for like a month or something.

251
00:18:36.50 --> 00:18:39.50
And then being a stepdad's like, I got tough, like a really tough job.

252
00:18:40.50 --> 00:18:45.50
Yeah, and he's man, he's, I don't want to sit and he had some issues of his own.

253
00:18:46.50 --> 00:18:48.50
So, man, like whiskey bottles and damn grain bins.

254
00:18:48.50 --> 00:18:52.50
Yeah, I can be out trying to feed horses. You're like, oh, there's a rich and rare.

255
00:18:53.50 --> 00:18:55.50
So, yeah, I can.

256
00:18:56.50 --> 00:18:59.50
When did you, so you were hunting your whole as grown up your whole life?

257
00:19:00.50 --> 00:19:00.50
Oh, yeah.

258
00:19:01.50 --> 00:19:01.50
Bo hunting, too.

259
00:19:02.50 --> 00:19:03.50
I started bow hunting in about 14.

260
00:19:04.50 --> 00:19:04.50
Okay.

261
00:19:05.50 --> 00:19:05.50
Because in Cody has been going to me into it.

262
00:19:06.50 --> 00:19:08.50
He's actually, I think last week, I think it was.

263
00:19:09.50 --> 00:19:10.50
He went try it out for the world team.

264
00:19:11.50 --> 00:19:12.50
Dang for, uh, stick bow.

265
00:19:13.50 --> 00:19:13.50
Dang.

266
00:19:14.50 --> 00:19:14.50
Yeah, he's pretty solemn.

267
00:19:14.50 --> 00:19:17.50
At what point did you start thinking about joining the military?

268
00:19:18.50 --> 00:19:21.50
Uh, you know, gee, I joined shit as a kid.

269
00:19:22.50 --> 00:19:23.50
I always thought about it.

270
00:19:24.50 --> 00:19:27.50
But I was, you know, what I thought for sure, I was going to go into military.

271
00:19:28.50 --> 00:19:29.50
But then there was nothing going on.

272
00:19:30.50 --> 00:19:33.50
I don't understand why anybody would join without a war.

273
00:19:34.50 --> 00:19:39.50
So, then I was just, you know, for so I went through a stretch where I thought I won't do this.

274
00:19:39.50 --> 00:19:45.50
And I was an F off and just riding bulls and just being dumb and party and then every other thing that young Cavaliers do.

275
00:19:46.50 --> 00:19:47.50
Jason girls and such.

276
00:19:48.50 --> 00:19:51.50
And then, uh, nine eleven happened.

277
00:19:52.50 --> 00:19:54.50
And I was, this is when I was actually at Rivers and High School.

278
00:19:55.50 --> 00:19:55.50
So you're a sophomore maybe?

279
00:19:56.50 --> 00:19:57.50
So I've just started your sophomore year.

280
00:19:58.50 --> 00:19:59.50
Yeah, sophomore year.

281
00:20:00.50 --> 00:20:00.50
No junior year.

282
00:20:01.50 --> 00:20:02.50
Yeah, so you graduated in then, oh, three.

283
00:20:03.50 --> 00:20:03.50
How's it junior?

284
00:20:04.50 --> 00:20:06.50
Because I was at Riverside because my sophomore year I was at Miller.

285
00:20:06.50 --> 00:20:10.50
Yeah, and we were slept in school.

286
00:20:11.50 --> 00:20:13.50
And what you know, it was like the first period of the day.

287
00:20:14.50 --> 00:20:14.50
But we were all over it.

288
00:20:15.50 --> 00:20:17.50
My cousin's house and one of the kids was there's a, uh,

289
00:20:18.50 --> 00:20:20.50
I can't remember if he's from Pakistan or whatever.

290
00:20:21.50 --> 00:20:25.50
But anyway, the friend of ours from Middle East and he was there with us, you know,

291
00:20:26.50 --> 00:20:29.50
walking the stuff, go down and I feel like that always kind of helped me.

292
00:20:30.50 --> 00:20:31.50
Like view things differently.

293
00:20:32.50 --> 00:20:33.50
Because he was still a buddy.

294
00:20:33.50 --> 00:20:36.50
You know, but we saw the towers come down.

295
00:20:37.50 --> 00:20:38.50
I was like, man, I don't know.

296
00:20:39.50 --> 00:20:41.50
I don't know if I got over there, you know.

297
00:20:42.50 --> 00:20:44.50
So I finished up school and then, uh, well, actually I enlisted as a junior.

298
00:20:45.50 --> 00:20:46.50
I was first, uh, recruiter that talked to me.

299
00:20:47.50 --> 00:20:47.50
I'm just enlisted.

300
00:20:48.50 --> 00:20:49.50
I was going as soon as over.

301
00:20:50.50 --> 00:20:53.50
And you just, the first recruiter you talked to was an Army recruiter?

302
00:20:54.50 --> 00:20:55.50
Yeah, that was that.

303
00:20:56.50 --> 00:20:57.50
Yeah, I didn't know crap.

304
00:20:58.50 --> 00:20:59.50
And my grandpa didn't really like Marine Corps very much.

305
00:20:59.50 --> 00:21:01.50
And the only thing he says, I'll kill you if you join the Marine Corps.

306
00:21:02.50 --> 00:21:04.50
He told me that.

307
00:21:05.50 --> 00:21:06.50
At least a dozen times growing up.

308
00:21:07.50 --> 00:21:09.50
Uh, and so I thought, well, it's not the Marine Corps.

309
00:21:10.50 --> 00:21:13.50
Did your grandfather fight, or maybe, which war?

310
00:21:14.50 --> 00:21:17.50
No, he, he, he split Vietnam and, uh, Korea.

311
00:21:18.50 --> 00:21:21.50
And then his brother, his two little brothers went over Vietnam.

312
00:21:22.50 --> 00:21:23.50
And I think he was bitter about that.

313
00:21:24.50 --> 00:21:26.50
I mean, I'm never, I never asked him why he had the Marine Corps.

314
00:21:26.50 --> 00:21:30.50
So I really don't know. I'm, I know he had a tattoo of a bulldog over here.

315
00:21:31.50 --> 00:21:34.50
And when he was older, he used to say, I say, Grandpa, when I was little and he was older.

316
00:21:35.50 --> 00:21:38.50
Say, Grandpa, what's that? You know, he said, it's a picture of your grandma.

317
00:21:39.50 --> 00:21:44.50
So you, did you know what kind of job you were having the Army?

318
00:21:45.50 --> 00:21:47.50
Did you even know that the Army had to job, sir?

319
00:21:48.50 --> 00:21:49.50
No. Well, I mean, not really.

320
00:21:50.50 --> 00:21:52.50
No. So he shows me this video, okay.

321
00:21:53.50 --> 00:21:54.50
Who's the recruiter?

322
00:21:54.50 --> 00:21:56.50
Yeah. I almost want to say his name.

323
00:21:57.50 --> 00:22:00.50
But he, uh, he's not a bad guy. He just did bad things.

324
00:22:01.50 --> 00:22:04.50
So he shows me this video and he's like, check that out.

325
00:22:05.50 --> 00:22:07.50
These dudes like jump now to points and shit. Oh, yeah.

326
00:22:08.50 --> 00:22:09.50
That looks bad.

327
00:22:10.50 --> 00:22:11.50
He's like, this way going to do him like hell. Yeah.

328
00:22:12.50 --> 00:22:12.50
And he's like, see that one guy?

329
00:22:13.50 --> 00:22:15.50
And it's like the, I'm assuming to the echo, the 18 echo or whatever.

330
00:22:16.50 --> 00:22:18.50
And he's like, see, I got with that radio.

331
00:22:19.50 --> 00:22:21.50
He's like, he gets paid six extra grand to join.

332
00:22:21.50 --> 00:22:24.50
And if he carries that radio, I mean, that's not exactly how he said it.

333
00:22:25.50 --> 00:22:26.50
But he's like, you get a signing bonus.

334
00:22:27.50 --> 00:22:29.50
And all you got to do is carry the section 20 pounds a gear or whatever.

335
00:22:30.50 --> 00:22:31.50
You know, he's like, you're tough enough.

336
00:22:32.50 --> 00:22:32.50
Carry 20 extra pounds. Oh, I'm like, oh, yeah.

337
00:22:33.50 --> 00:22:35.50
He's running that racket before.

338
00:22:36.50 --> 00:22:36.50
Yeah.

339
00:22:37.50 --> 00:22:38.50
Played psychological warfare. You're tough enough, right?

340
00:22:39.50 --> 00:22:39.50
Yeah.

341
00:22:40.50 --> 00:22:41.50
Oh, this is just, yeah.

342
00:22:42.50 --> 00:22:42.50
It's still frustrating.

343
00:22:43.50 --> 00:22:44.50
So I'm not going to hate the guy and work down.

344
00:22:45.50 --> 00:22:46.50
So, so what did you enlist as?

345
00:22:47.50 --> 00:22:48.50
Did you have an MOS when you enlist?

346
00:22:48.50 --> 00:22:49.50
Yeah, as a calm job.

347
00:22:50.50 --> 00:22:51.50
There's a 31 series calm jobs.

348
00:22:52.50 --> 00:22:54.50
31, uh, you know, if they changed it, but I think it was a 31 uniform.

349
00:22:55.50 --> 00:22:55.50
It's time.

350
00:22:56.50 --> 00:22:58.50
It has, like, signal, something.

351
00:22:59.50 --> 00:23:01.50
I honest to goodness did not a single thing.

352
00:23:02.50 --> 00:23:04.50
I had, I had dudes.

353
00:23:05.50 --> 00:23:07.50
I could barely feel a single hour when we were over there.

354
00:23:08.50 --> 00:23:08.50
I didn't know shit.

355
00:23:09.50 --> 00:23:13.50
In fact, one time I was dating a girl and she was like, what's the smartest thing you ever did when you were over there?

356
00:23:14.50 --> 00:23:15.50
And I was like, what's the thing?

357
00:23:15.50 --> 00:23:17.50
Like, the most brain power.

358
00:23:18.50 --> 00:23:21.50
I was like, I set up a tax at one time on this island.

359
00:23:22.50 --> 00:23:25.50
And I was like, I was thinking about my, oh shit, I just carried it.

360
00:23:26.50 --> 00:23:28.50
But I really, you know, you didn't even say it.

361
00:23:29.50 --> 00:23:31.50
But really, in my head at first, I had thought it to it,

362
00:23:32.50 --> 00:23:33.50
but then I remember I gave it to Adam.

363
00:23:37.50 --> 00:23:38.50
And you joined the National Guard, right?

364
00:23:39.50 --> 00:23:39.50
Yeah.

365
00:23:39.50 --> 00:23:40.50
Did you know the difference between the National Guard?

366
00:23:40.50 --> 00:23:47.50
No, I don't, I swear to you, I think maybe 20% of kids at that time had any idea what was going on.

367
00:23:48.50 --> 00:23:52.50
So like, small town Utah has a bunch of those National Guard recruiting stations.

368
00:23:53.50 --> 00:23:55.50
They don't know. You inform size the same thing, you know, shit.

369
00:23:56.50 --> 00:23:58.50
Unless you have like a family member that's in or something.

370
00:23:59.50 --> 00:24:00.50
And then that's different.

371
00:24:01.50 --> 00:24:03.50
Which my buddy who I enlisted with had a family member that was in.

372
00:24:04.50 --> 00:24:05.50
Did they tell him what was up?

373
00:24:06.50 --> 00:24:06.50
Did he know what was going on?

374
00:24:06.50 --> 00:24:07.50
Here's what I think happened there.

375
00:24:07.50 --> 00:24:11.50
His brother-in-law, really good dude.

376
00:24:12.50 --> 00:24:16.50
I think was like, let's not get you guys sent over into a meat grinder.

377
00:24:17.50 --> 00:24:20.50
God, I think that's, if I had to get a little did he know.

378
00:24:20.50 --> 00:24:21.50
Yeah, right?

379
00:24:22.50 --> 00:24:27.50
And you know, it's funny. The guard thing works out better for me because how did I been in an active unit with that shit,

380
00:24:28.50 --> 00:24:29.50
MLS, I wouldn't have never did anything.

381
00:24:30.50 --> 00:24:32.50
I don't even stuck in a freaking com cage the entire time.

382
00:24:33.50 --> 00:24:34.50
So, it kind of worked out.

383
00:24:34.50 --> 00:24:39.50
Yeah. So, did you go to boot camp in between your junior and senior years now?

384
00:24:40.50 --> 00:24:41.50
So you had to fully graduate.

385
00:24:42.50 --> 00:24:43.50
Yeah. You fully graduated.

386
00:24:44.50 --> 00:24:45.50
Delayed entry and whatever they call them.

387
00:24:46.50 --> 00:24:48.50
And you fully graduated.

388
00:24:49.50 --> 00:24:52.50
At what point did you know that you were going to be activated and sent to overseas?

389
00:24:53.50 --> 00:24:54.50
I volunteered for it.

390
00:24:55.50 --> 00:24:59.50
So I got to, so I went through basic training and then what did you think when you got to basic training?

391
00:25:00.50 --> 00:25:01.50
I'll tell you.

392
00:25:01.50 --> 00:25:08.50
So my recruitment. So I always tell people, like, when you get to boot camp, you're not going to like me anymore.

393
00:25:09.50 --> 00:25:12.50
There's going to be two to three weeks where you're like, jocco, I hate that guy.

394
00:25:13.50 --> 00:25:18.50
If I ever see him, I'm going to take a swing out of, because no, my almost no matter who you are, when you get to boot camp,

395
00:25:19.50 --> 00:25:20.50
you think,

396
00:25:21.50 --> 00:25:22.50
Oh, this was a mistake.

397
00:25:23.50 --> 00:25:26.50
Yeah, especially them first three weeks, but then toward the end, it starts to become right.

398
00:25:26.50 --> 00:25:31.50
You're like, this is cool. And so I went to Fort Bending, but pokeside Fort Bending.

399
00:25:32.50 --> 00:25:43.50
And again, wake up every morning screaming infantry in all this shit, you know, and then so my recruiter had also he put me through maps with the airborne physical and all the stuff.

400
00:25:44.50 --> 00:25:46.50
Tell me how to airborne on my contract, all this shit.

401
00:25:47.50 --> 00:25:51.50
I get in the boot camp and, you know, like two weeks before when you're at Bending, they call up.

402
00:25:52.50 --> 00:25:54.50
And they're together with the airborne on your contract coming here and line up.

403
00:25:54.50 --> 00:25:58.50
I come on up, you know, I go in there and he's like, what the fuck are you doing?

404
00:25:59.50 --> 00:26:03.50
I'm like, what are you talking about? He's like, you ain't no fucking airborne in your contract.

405
00:26:04.50 --> 00:26:11.50
So, it wasn't even in your contract. He went as far as to put me through the airborne physical, but it wasn't in your contract.

406
00:26:12.50 --> 00:26:14.50
Yeah, like why go through the physical? It's not like, no one else does.

407
00:26:15.50 --> 00:26:20.50
So anyway, I feel like I got kind of, but it worked out, you know, I'm not trying to complain, but I do feel like he

408
00:26:20.50 --> 00:26:23.50
was a little near to some salty.

409
00:26:24.50 --> 00:26:26.50
I think like, been to almost 20 years later about this.

410
00:26:27.50 --> 00:26:35.50
But when you're going through boot camp in the national guard to be reserved, you must also, that's like, make it a little bit more comfortable.

411
00:26:36.50 --> 00:26:40.50
Because you can find some comfort in the fact that like, God, well, at least I didn't go active duty.

412
00:26:41.50 --> 00:26:48.50
Whereas if you're active duty, you're like, oh, this is the rest of my, this is the next six, four years of my life is to be in the surrounded by these crazy people, young and screaming.

413
00:26:48.50 --> 00:26:51.50
Because you think that's what the military's like when you go to boot camp.

414
00:26:52.50 --> 00:26:55.50
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I mean, I guess, but I just want to go to the warm, man.

415
00:26:56.50 --> 00:26:59.50
So, as soon as I got back to my unit after I, T, you know, stuff.

416
00:27:00.50 --> 00:27:05.50
So you went to boot camp, AIT, were you kicking ass in AIT since you killed so many freaking woodpeckers growing up?

417
00:27:06.50 --> 00:27:10.50
Or you like, no, I just wanted you, were you marksman and expert and all that stuff?

418
00:27:10.50 --> 00:27:17.50
I mean, I shot fine, you know, I don't think I was, but the, the triggers on those were really hard to use to them, 16 trigger first, but I mean, I shot fine.

419
00:27:18.50 --> 00:27:22.50
What about, what about just like being out in the woods and just feeling good about all that?

420
00:27:23.50 --> 00:27:23.50
That was great.

421
00:27:23.50 --> 00:27:25.50
Yeah, you kind of kick ass in the bet AIT.

422
00:27:25.50 --> 00:27:27.50
Yeah, especially like the FTX stuff.

423
00:27:28.50 --> 00:27:30.50
I mean, it was like nothing, man.

424
00:27:30.50 --> 00:27:33.50
It's like all these dudes are all worried about like three days in the mud.

425
00:27:34.50 --> 00:27:35.50
It's like camp, man.

426
00:27:35.50 --> 00:27:46.50
The only time it sucked is when it, uh, it banning on our final FTX at rain, which I think is true for like almost anybody that goes through banning, but it rained for like the entire time.

427
00:27:47.50 --> 00:27:56.50
So all of our hasties were like water up to our chest and still have like that, you know, in fact, what, uh, one time during night guard, my body, you know, we had your ankles in a locked in hasties or whatever.

428
00:27:56.50 --> 00:28:04.50
Oh, he was, he was sleeping and I was up and it was his turn I turned around and there's a wolf spider like this big. She might put that sucker on us.

429
00:28:05.50 --> 00:28:06.50
That's right.

430
00:28:07.50 --> 00:28:07.50
Yeah, I just tapped him.

431
00:28:08.50 --> 00:28:11.50
It's eyes are like, you know, you can't make noise, no.

432
00:28:12.50 --> 00:28:14.50
I was like, trying to get it off of you.

433
00:28:15.50 --> 00:28:18.50
Anyway, yeah, um, I wasn't Fort Lewis Washington.

434
00:28:19.50 --> 00:28:22.50
I was going through sealed tactical training, which is what, what you do in your new guy.

435
00:28:22.50 --> 00:28:36.50
And then we, there's some pretty heinous mosquitoes where we were and I had learned to carry a mosquito. I would just carry like a, like a, you won yard square of mosquito netting.

436
00:28:37.50 --> 00:28:44.50
And that way, if we laid up, I could just take that thing out and just put it underneath my floppy hat and and talking to my collar and be good to go.

437
00:28:44.50 --> 00:29:02.50
Well, my, my, the officer that was in charge of us brought, brought like a full on mosquito net like you see, I don't know, like maybe in some British colonists who were in like Africa in like 1875 or something.

438
00:29:03.50 --> 00:29:11.50
You know, this big giant screen with the wicker bands around it pushing it out and so we're in this layup position.

439
00:29:11.50 --> 00:29:15.50
And this other friend of mine didn't have any net and a lot of guys actually didn't have any net.

440
00:29:16.50 --> 00:29:20.50
And so my buddy was sitting there catching mosquitoes and putting them into this.

441
00:29:21.50 --> 00:29:25.50
While he was sleeping catching mosquitoes, and with the mosquitoes, he actually trapped his eyes.

442
00:29:26.50 --> 00:29:28.50
He woke up for the morning.

443
00:29:30.50 --> 00:29:31.50
I got to kick out of that one.

444
00:29:32.50 --> 00:29:33.50
That's brutal.

445
00:29:34.50 --> 00:29:36.50
Uh, what were you to say though?

446
00:29:36.50 --> 00:29:43.50
So you, you put the spider on the, oh yeah, yeah, it just is just funny to watch and spas out when he knew we could have made no one.

447
00:29:44.50 --> 00:29:50.50
You know, you skit this mosquito was better though.

448
00:29:51.50 --> 00:29:56.50
So you feeling good at AIT and the war is in full swing right now, right? So what year is this?

449
00:29:57.50 --> 00:29:59.50
This is G 2002 and three. I don't know. What was that?

450
00:29:59.50 --> 00:30:05.50
It was at the unforged two and three probably getting and you said you graduated in 2003 and you went right to boot camp.

451
00:30:06.50 --> 00:30:09.50
There was a couple months break because I was doing concrete.

452
00:30:10.50 --> 00:30:14.50
So I did conquer. So I must have went to boot camp around October.

453
00:30:15.50 --> 00:30:16.50
So it's probably 2004.

454
00:30:17.50 --> 00:30:22.50
Well, that would have known because no, because well, maybe it was. I can't remember. I'm sorry.

455
00:30:23.50 --> 00:30:26.50
I'm just trying to think time phrase time frame what was not.

456
00:30:26.50 --> 00:30:30.50
No, I couldn't even record it. Because we shipped.

457
00:30:32.50 --> 00:30:36.50
Oh, shit. Maybe I'm sorry. I keep doing this now. I'm thinking we shipped out on January.

458
00:30:38.50 --> 00:30:44.50
21st of 2005 for a right. So probably was 2004.

459
00:30:45.50 --> 00:30:54.50
Yeah. So you got when you got done with it. It's like 2004. So the war is going, but it's not gotten crazy yet in 2000.

460
00:30:54.50 --> 00:31:00.50
No, it's still like pretty low level conflict happening in Iraq.

461
00:31:02.50 --> 00:31:08.50
Then you got them with AIT. Then what happened? Did you go home and you would get attached to your unit?

462
00:31:09.50 --> 00:31:10.50
But you didn't deploy right away. Did you?

463
00:31:11.50 --> 00:31:16.50
It wasn't very long. I can't remember how long. It wasn't very long at all. I went to the first drill thing.

464
00:31:18.50 --> 00:31:20.50
And I was like, this is horrific.

465
00:31:20.50 --> 00:31:24.50
What going to drill? It was just.

466
00:31:25.50 --> 00:31:28.50
I didn't do it was terrible. Because you wanted to be.

467
00:31:29.50 --> 00:31:38.50
Well, it's also just, yeah, and it's just like sitting doing radio shit and like in a, like, a office and stuff and like, no, I'm not about it.

468
00:31:39.50 --> 00:31:46.50
So as soon as there was somebody to point and they said they had, so I was in drill.

469
00:31:46.50 --> 00:31:50.50
I can't remember which iteration drill was, but I was in drill.

470
00:31:51.50 --> 00:31:56.50
And they said they had someone downstairs doing SRP to go or it wasn't SRP.

471
00:31:57.50 --> 00:31:59.50
What's the SRP?

472
00:32:00.50 --> 00:32:04.50
It's like, we're getting all your checking all your paperwork vaccination.

473
00:32:05.50 --> 00:32:08.50
Let's get this to go out. I can't remember the right. That's right. I can't.

474
00:32:09.50 --> 00:32:10.50
But anyway, they were downstairs doing that crap.

475
00:32:10.50 --> 00:32:18.50
And they said that they had slots. And so I went and talked to my first line later. And I was like, I want to go, you know, I want to go on this.

476
00:32:19.50 --> 00:32:23.50
And he was like, fine, you know, so he let me go down there and go.

477
00:32:24.50 --> 00:32:26.50
How long did they do extra training?

478
00:32:27.50 --> 00:32:29.50
Yeah, who did they attach you to get ready to deploy?

479
00:32:30.50 --> 00:32:31.50
Groundski's 28th ID.

480
00:32:31.50 --> 00:32:41.50
They sent us to, so after we, yeah, and so that was actually, yeah, so we went straight from there to from Utah to Mississippi.

481
00:32:42.50 --> 00:32:43.50
Just know what the hell is going with that?

482
00:32:44.50 --> 00:32:47.50
Camp Shelby. And we did a couple months of camp Shelby.

483
00:32:48.50 --> 00:32:50.50
And then we did a month rotation to NTC.

484
00:32:51.50 --> 00:32:51.50
And then we shipped.

485
00:32:52.50 --> 00:32:54.50
And how was that? Did you feel like you were getting pretty well prepared?

486
00:32:55.50 --> 00:32:58.50
Yes, well, because by then they put us, they stood up an actual PSDL.

487
00:32:58.50 --> 00:33:01.50
And so we had a separate training cycle.

488
00:33:02.50 --> 00:33:03.50
Same cycle, but separate training pathway.

489
00:33:04.50 --> 00:33:09.50
So other than like company live fires and stuff like this, we were all getting spun up by.

490
00:33:10.50 --> 00:33:14.50
And mostly, OCs were like Rangers because they were the only ones that really been doing PSD for real.

491
00:33:15.50 --> 00:33:18.50
So we had good OCs. I felt like in training was pretty good.

492
00:33:19.50 --> 00:33:20.50
It was better training that I got anywhere else.

493
00:33:21.50 --> 00:33:25.50
So you immediately got attached to a group that was going to be doing PSD, which is personal secured detail.

494
00:33:25.50 --> 00:33:28.50
That's where that's what they told you your job was going to be.

495
00:33:28.50 --> 00:33:33.50
Yeah, they pulled from within the unit and developed a PSDL because they didn't have one.

496
00:33:34.50 --> 00:33:39.50
And then you went to, you ended up going to NTC, which is in front of Irwin, California,

497
00:33:40.50 --> 00:33:42.50
which is freaking awesome training.

498
00:33:43.50 --> 00:33:47.50
They have whole city set up, villages and role players and pyro techniques.

499
00:33:48.50 --> 00:33:49.50
Did they have all that stuff for you guys?

500
00:33:50.50 --> 00:33:51.50
Were you feeling pretty good about it?

501
00:33:51.50 --> 00:33:54.50
Yeah, we were living in those circus tents.

502
00:33:55.50 --> 00:33:56.50
That part's not fun.

503
00:33:57.50 --> 00:34:02.50
Yeah, the training was good. I feel like, yeah, but the two uniforms for like 30 days in that circus tent was not my favorite.

504
00:34:03.50 --> 00:34:09.50
Now, at this time, Ramadi is start, do you know when you find out you're going to actually tell Ramadi, like you don't know, day before we should.

505
00:34:11.50 --> 00:34:12.50
Get stuff.

506
00:34:13.50 --> 00:34:18.50
They were just kept telling us, take this training series, man, because you might have to use it, you know, that kind of stuff.

507
00:34:18.50 --> 00:34:22.50
You'd hear like grumblings, SUNY Triangle, you'd hear this kind of stuff.

508
00:34:23.50 --> 00:34:25.50
Okay, you're ready to rock it wrong.

509
00:34:26.50 --> 00:34:27.50
How old were you at this point?

510
00:34:28.50 --> 00:34:29.50
Yeah, hell, yeah.

511
00:34:30.50 --> 00:34:31.50
You just young and dumb man.

512
00:34:33.50 --> 00:34:33.50
Yeah.

513
00:34:34.50 --> 00:34:35.50
So then you get done with that.

514
00:34:36.50 --> 00:34:37.50
Now it's time to leave.

515
00:34:38.50 --> 00:34:40.50
Do you freaking blow it out before you went overseas?

516
00:34:41.50 --> 00:34:44.50
Yeah, we, yeah, we spent some time with you.

517
00:34:44.50 --> 00:34:46.50
I'm always in for a minute.

518
00:34:48.50 --> 00:34:49.50
Yeah.

519
00:34:52.50 --> 00:34:57.50
And when you, when you're leaving, what's your, what's your parents saying?

520
00:34:58.50 --> 00:34:59.50
What's your mom saying?

521
00:35:00.50 --> 00:35:02.50
Oh, my grandfather saying, are they worried sick?

522
00:35:03.50 --> 00:35:06.50
Yeah, my mom for sure was my grandpa just didn't say much.

523
00:35:06.50 --> 00:35:13.50
Honestly, he really never did about any of this, but my mom was definitely terrified the whole time for sure.

524
00:35:14.50 --> 00:35:15.50
She wasn't happy and.

525
00:35:16.50 --> 00:35:19.50
I just kind of laughed a little bit about no watch.

526
00:35:20.50 --> 00:35:26.50
Because I'm thinking you're 90, like there's nothing else in the world you want to do and your mom's just horrified by the whole thing.

527
00:35:27.50 --> 00:35:27.50
Sorry mom.

528
00:35:28.50 --> 00:35:30.50
And honestly, as father now, I got three boys now.

529
00:35:31.50 --> 00:35:33.50
I've a daughter and three boys and I think about it all the time.

530
00:35:33.50 --> 00:35:40.50
I think it must be much, much worse to send a kid off to war than to go to war yourself.

531
00:35:41.50 --> 00:35:41.50
Yeah, it would have to.

532
00:35:42.50 --> 00:35:48.50
And I've also always felt that it would be worse like when I was overseas, I think it was worse for my wife than it was for me.

533
00:35:49.50 --> 00:35:50.50
Because I know what's going on.

534
00:35:51.50 --> 00:35:51.50
Yeah.

535
00:35:52.50 --> 00:36:00.50
If I die, it's kind of like, I mean, I don't, you know, I'm not really going to like care too much.

536
00:36:00.50 --> 00:36:02.50
I mean, I guess I would be bummed for that.

537
00:36:03.50 --> 00:36:08.50
But, but, but, you know, my wife is going to be, you know, stuck with all these kids and everything.

538
00:36:09.50 --> 00:36:10.50
So I don't know.

539
00:36:11.50 --> 00:36:15.50
I always felt like it was much harder for the people that are staying home than it is for the people that are going overseas.

540
00:36:16.50 --> 00:36:16.50
Yeah.

541
00:36:17.50 --> 00:36:19.50
But worse even still for kids, I think.

542
00:36:20.50 --> 00:36:21.50
Like the children of.

543
00:36:22.50 --> 00:36:22.50
Yeah.

544
00:36:23.50 --> 00:36:23.50
Yeah.

545
00:36:24.50 --> 00:36:25.50
I think my kids were actually too young to even understand.

546
00:36:26.50 --> 00:36:26.50
They were.

547
00:36:26.50 --> 00:36:33.50
And between the ages of like, I guess seven and three.

548
00:36:34.50 --> 00:36:35.50
Is that right?

549
00:36:36.50 --> 00:36:38.50
Yeah, seven and three or something like that.

550
00:36:39.50 --> 00:36:41.50
So I don't think they really even comprehended.

551
00:36:42.50 --> 00:36:43.50
And I don't know.

552
00:36:44.50 --> 00:36:47.50
You know, like one thing with me is I never, I never like wore a uniform home.

553
00:36:48.50 --> 00:36:53.50
In the sealed teams, you just don't, you just, you know, you got all your shit at work and you just put your uniform on and you get there.

554
00:36:53.50 --> 00:36:56.50
When you get done, you've promised shorts and a t shirt and flip flops and you go home.

555
00:36:57.50 --> 00:36:59.50
And your kids just don't even know what's happening.

556
00:36:59.50 --> 00:37:01.50
They don't understand any of it, you know.

557
00:37:02.50 --> 00:37:05.50
They just think you just go to work sometimes and you travel.

558
00:37:06.50 --> 00:37:06.50
I don't know.

559
00:37:06.50 --> 00:37:14.50
I don't think my kids really connected it too much that they were that I don't think they had the mental capacity or understanding to actually worry.

560
00:37:15.50 --> 00:37:16.50
I don't think they worried at all.

561
00:37:16.50 --> 00:37:18.50
I don't think they worried one second.

562
00:37:19.50 --> 00:37:20.50
Not like my wife did.

563
00:37:20.50 --> 00:37:24.50
Especially when she's going to, you know, going to hospital visit guys and stuff like that.

564
00:37:25.50 --> 00:37:28.50
I guess when the kids are a little bit older.

565
00:37:29.50 --> 00:37:30.50
Yeah, you're probably right about all that though.

566
00:37:31.50 --> 00:37:34.50
Yeah, he's like, when I think even now when I go hunting for a week or so,

567
00:37:35.50 --> 00:37:37.50
I probably worry more than my kids are missed my kids more than they miss me.

568
00:37:38.50 --> 00:37:41.50
Yeah, yeah, yeah, my buddy, Dave.

569
00:37:42.50 --> 00:37:45.50
You know, he's got young kids right now and he was talking to me.

570
00:37:45.50 --> 00:37:49.50
He was talking to me, he's like, I don't know how you, how do you went on deployment.

571
00:37:50.50 --> 00:37:53.50
He feels bad when he goes on a work trip for a week, you know.

572
00:37:54.50 --> 00:37:58.50
And I get it, you know, and maybe it's because, you know, he's older than I was at the time.

573
00:37:59.50 --> 00:38:05.50
And I guess I had that like kind of mindset that was a little bit maybe not super good.

574
00:38:10.50 --> 00:38:13.50
So you find out a day before you find out you guys are going to see.

575
00:38:13.50 --> 00:38:17.50
It was it was either like a day or two before one long time. I mean, I don't think it was a week.

576
00:38:18.50 --> 00:38:21.50
Did you know anything about Romadi? Yeah, I mean we were watching the news.

577
00:38:22.50 --> 00:38:27.50
And yeah, Feliz did happen about eight months or so before something like that.

578
00:38:28.50 --> 00:38:30.50
Maybe four year.

579
00:38:30.50 --> 00:38:32.50
One was found if you were in May.

580
00:38:32.50 --> 00:38:33.50
Yeah, something like that.

581
00:38:34.50 --> 00:38:37.50
So yeah, about a year before Feliz did happen.

582
00:38:37.50 --> 00:38:39.50
So we had, you know, we got some idea.

583
00:38:39.50 --> 00:38:43.50
Uh-huh, then ever, all the bad guys pushed into the Romadi at that time.

584
00:38:44.50 --> 00:38:45.50
Yeah, I mean, he's such a story with always.

585
00:38:46.50 --> 00:38:48.50
Yeah, I think it was pretty accurate.

586
00:38:48.50 --> 00:38:54.50
Just when you look at the level of violence from Felizja and then the level of violence in Romadi at that time,

587
00:38:54.50 --> 00:38:56.50
it definitely flared up a lot.

588
00:38:57.50 --> 00:39:01.50
Do you guys just fly over in like a C 17 or something? How do you get over there?

589
00:39:01.50 --> 00:39:04.50
No, we flew over in like Delta or something.

590
00:39:04.50 --> 00:39:07.50
I was like a civilian jet to where to coate.

591
00:39:07.50 --> 00:39:09.50
Yeah, we flew into Coate.

592
00:39:09.50 --> 00:39:17.50
We went from Mississippi and then fueled up in Maine and then from Maine to Shannon Island and then from Shannon Island to Coate.

593
00:39:18.50 --> 00:39:19.50
And then you get to Coate.

594
00:39:19.50 --> 00:39:23.50
Now they throw you on C 130s and bring you into Romadi or how I drove up.

595
00:39:24.50 --> 00:39:26.50
Yeah, we were all unit.

596
00:39:26.50 --> 00:39:31.50
No, they flew them up, but our team was security for the log pack and all that.

597
00:39:31.50 --> 00:39:32.50
And all that.

598
00:39:32.50 --> 00:39:35.50
So we drove the Sardines through Navstar.

599
00:39:35.50 --> 00:39:38.50
And so now it's 2005.

600
00:39:41.50 --> 00:39:43.50
Yeah, now it's 2000, but what month?

601
00:39:44.50 --> 00:39:45.50
I think May.

602
00:39:45.50 --> 00:39:47.50
No, June is June, I think.

603
00:39:47.50 --> 00:39:48.50
June of 2005.

604
00:39:49.50 --> 00:39:51.50
You're rolling up.

605
00:39:51.50 --> 00:39:53.50
So that's the freaking transit right there.

606
00:39:53.50 --> 00:39:57.50
Yeah, because speaking of the SUNY triangle, you're going right through that.

607
00:39:57.50 --> 00:40:02.50
Yeah, so yeah, so yeah, the first day was not.

608
00:40:02.50 --> 00:40:15.50
I mean, it was interesting, you know, once you cross those gates in there, it's like oil wells on fire and stuff and bowl of whole cars here and there scattered, but there's really not like anything going on in the South by rack.

609
00:40:15.50 --> 00:40:23.50
So for the first day, the first nine hours, I can't remember if it was, so we left burying is where we rolled out of and Kuwait.

610
00:40:23.50 --> 00:40:27.50
And the, was it Scania might, we might have been the first stop.

611
00:40:27.50 --> 00:40:29.50
I think Scania was the first stop.

612
00:40:29.50 --> 00:40:32.50
Anyway, so throughout that and like nothing happened.

613
00:40:32.50 --> 00:40:37.50
And then, but other than, you know, just kind of taking in the culture and it is, it is a for real culture track.

614
00:40:37.50 --> 00:40:44.50
Like southern Iraq, you know, anyone who's spending time in Mexico, you've seen poverty that's different than poverty in America for sure.

615
00:40:44.50 --> 00:40:48.50
Like, but the poverty in the South by rack is a whole new level.

616
00:40:48.50 --> 00:40:54.50
I mean, dudes like still in pieces of tarps from Americans, just like patch holes in their tents and stuff.

617
00:40:54.50 --> 00:40:56.50
So that was kind of a shock.

618
00:40:56.50 --> 00:41:02.50
And then, you know, kids coming up asking for water and food and this kind of shit, you know, that was like new.

619
00:41:02.50 --> 00:41:07.50
Or if you get slowed down somewhere dudes want cigarettes, tapping on anyone know.

620
00:41:07.50 --> 00:41:14.50
You know, like, so it was, it was interesting to sort of, it was kind of, and in some ways it was good to get acclimated,

621
00:41:14.50 --> 00:41:20.50
but nothing really happened on that first two days and then on day three, we ended up hitting,

622
00:41:20.50 --> 00:41:27.50
we didn't, we didn't detonate, we didn't end up discovering an idea, the lead truck did, and this was between Flusion and Baghdad.

623
00:41:27.50 --> 00:41:33.50
And so I was like our first rule experience with doing anything for real in country, you know.

624
00:41:33.50 --> 00:41:37.50
How many vehicles, like, just estimate, like how many vehicles are in this log pack?

625
00:41:37.50 --> 00:41:39.50
Is this like a 40 vehicle?

626
00:41:39.50 --> 00:41:41.50
I could have been more sensitive.

627
00:41:41.50 --> 00:41:49.50
Yeah, it took like six hours or so, I can't remember, three hours, it took hours and hours if you, you know, all these, I can't take a long time.

628
00:41:49.50 --> 00:41:52.50
Oh, man.

629
00:41:52.50 --> 00:41:57.50
So when did you finally pull into Ramadi? How many days did it take you to get there?

630
00:41:57.50 --> 00:42:01.50
Three days you pulled into camp Ramadi.

631
00:42:01.50 --> 00:42:08.50
And they, what's that like, maybe settling in, you've get moved into a barracks or, where did you, where did you guys stay at?

632
00:42:08.50 --> 00:42:10.50
No, yeah, city.

633
00:42:10.50 --> 00:42:12.50
No, they didn't have any of that yet.

634
00:42:12.50 --> 00:42:18.50
There was a big, there was a big MWR building at the front and then just put us up in that, you know, where they had that boxing.

635
00:42:18.50 --> 00:42:20.50
And that stuff in there.

636
00:42:20.50 --> 00:42:25.50
There's put us up in that in Cots for a week or two, I can't remember.

637
00:42:25.50 --> 00:42:31.50
But it was easier, I think it was easier for us in some ways to transit, for the people that were going to go outside the wire.

638
00:42:31.50 --> 00:42:41.50
I think it was easier for us for the first, like, mentally for that first week because when we hit that, when we hit that, you know, when I say hit it didn't detonate.

639
00:42:41.50 --> 00:42:52.50
When we hit that ID, it's kind of like, you know, bathes and fire in some ways, like you to see all, like, what this war is really about to be for the next year.

640
00:42:52.50 --> 00:42:55.50
You know, it's like middle of the night.

641
00:42:55.50 --> 00:43:01.50
The Marines that were helping us, they came, you know, tapped on the door and like, hey, we need help.

642
00:43:01.50 --> 00:43:04.50
You know, you want to go and go hell yeah, I want to go.

643
00:43:04.50 --> 00:43:08.50
So it's like, 84, you know, like, let's go.

644
00:43:08.50 --> 00:43:14.50
And so it was me and Johnny and these two Marines went out up this debt cord.

645
00:43:14.50 --> 00:43:23.50
So what they they'd found an ID and, you know, it's, honestly, after I'd been there for a while, looking backwards, it's a very obvious set up, right?

646
00:43:23.50 --> 00:43:32.50
There was an ID and then the students prayer rug and as drivers license was just left there, you know, it's like, or is ID cord, no drivers license.

647
00:43:32.50 --> 00:43:40.50
So we were told, we don't have time, you know, EOD can't make it, whatever, just trace that debt cord.

648
00:43:40.50 --> 00:43:46.50
And if it goes into the house, because it was going out into this compound, you know, all of the old true type stuff.

649
00:43:46.50 --> 00:43:52.50
So like, if it goes into the house, just frag the house and come back and also like, oh yeah.

650
00:43:52.50 --> 00:43:55.50
So, like, how the so-free gets to hope.

651
00:43:55.50 --> 00:43:59.50
So we hit the edge of this compound, you know, undernought this is you.

652
00:43:59.50 --> 00:44:03.50
And then two Marines and your buddy Johnny, yeah, my first line later, it's not sure.

653
00:44:03.50 --> 00:44:07.50
And well, I guess he stayed my first line later, but as before I got promoted.

654
00:44:07.50 --> 00:44:13.50
And it was, you know how they'd have those big, obviously, you know, but they'd have those walls, you know, senior block walls.

655
00:44:13.50 --> 00:44:21.50
Well, this one had a gate that was locked and then you could see there's a hole in the sides where I'd go or just go through the hole.

656
00:44:21.50 --> 00:44:27.50
So we go around and as we come around that hole, you get here a generator running.

657
00:44:27.50 --> 00:44:31.50
I just assumed that it was in the back or something, but you could hear a generator running.

658
00:44:31.50 --> 00:44:35.50
And then this dog starts barking like this little yappy dog.

659
00:44:35.50 --> 00:44:43.50
And we're like, in my mind, the only thing we got going for is right now, just four men is that nobody knows we're here.

660
00:44:43.50 --> 00:44:47.50
You know, with this compound, you don't exactly want to take plunging fire on this compound.

661
00:44:47.50 --> 00:44:49.50
I'm just four dudes very badly.

662
00:44:49.50 --> 00:44:51.50
So now I'm like, I can't wait to blow that f and dog up, man.

663
00:44:51.50 --> 00:44:57.50
I'm trying to hit that dude with my frag.

664
00:44:57.50 --> 00:45:03.50
I'm thinking that as we're coming around toward the front of the, toward the front of the home.

665
00:45:03.50 --> 00:45:11.50
And then once we take the right, you know, so we just go in the house here and then take a right towards the actual front and you could see the debt court going into the house.

666
00:45:11.50 --> 00:45:15.50
And I was like, oh yeah, man, this is, it's about beyond.

667
00:45:15.50 --> 00:45:19.50
So we go around the debt court and then there's a black kind of a half ass like a stoop, not a true porch, but I could stoop.

668
00:45:19.50 --> 00:45:27.50
And on that stoop was these sandals all laid out and like succession, you could tell us like,

669
00:45:27.50 --> 00:45:35.50
Dad, Mom, you know, son, older daughter, and then baby daughter with like these little two inch pink sandals.

670
00:45:35.50 --> 00:45:41.50
And then I had a little sister, I just still do, but I was very close to her at the time.

671
00:45:41.50 --> 00:45:43.50
She was like six or seven at that time.

672
00:45:43.50 --> 00:45:47.50
And man, that hit me like a free train, you know, like whoa.

673
00:45:47.50 --> 00:45:51.50
You know, it's not, it's, you know, just killing bad guys all the time, you know.

674
00:45:51.50 --> 00:45:53.50
So what ended up happening?

675
00:45:53.50 --> 00:45:55.50
We went all the way around.

676
00:45:55.50 --> 00:45:57.50
It ended pretty good.

677
00:45:57.50 --> 00:46:03.50
Actually, we went all the way around and the debt court came out and went into his orchard and the back.

678
00:46:03.50 --> 00:46:07.50
So we traveled through it a little bit and then one of them reen said,

679
00:46:07.50 --> 00:46:11.50
Hey, I'm gonna pull a pin flare out or pop a pin flare and Johnny didn't hear him.

680
00:46:11.50 --> 00:46:15.50
So I'm like, over here, like in a small echelon and Marine pops off.

681
00:46:15.50 --> 00:46:17.50
Pin flare and Johnny just hits the deck.

682
00:46:17.50 --> 00:46:19.50
You know what I'm saying?

683
00:46:19.50 --> 00:46:23.50
So I got a good kick out of it.

684
00:46:23.50 --> 00:46:25.50
But we stopped there for a minute.

685
00:46:25.50 --> 00:46:33.50
We just see that the decor was going out somewhere and there was two dudes up in another home on a balcony, smoke and cigars, you know, with AKs.

686
00:46:33.50 --> 00:46:41.50
It was like, well, anyway, depending on situation, but we went, you know, we didn't know that.

687
00:46:41.50 --> 00:46:45.50
We didn't know that.

688
00:46:45.50 --> 00:46:49.50
But the thing is like, almost guaranteed those dudes are waiting to see what we would do.

689
00:46:49.50 --> 00:46:53.50
Almost guaranteed they were the ones who set it up and everything.

690
00:46:53.50 --> 00:46:57.50
And I mean, what are you doing smoking cigars on your deck at two, four?

691
00:46:57.50 --> 00:47:05.50
Yeah, you can't, you can't even answer that question because they would be doing the most wild, crazy, like, sunset.

692
00:47:05.50 --> 00:47:13.50
So things that you ever have imagined in a million years, you know, like, like, for instance, 240 in the morning.

693
00:47:13.50 --> 00:47:19.50
I mean, I had a guy approach a target one time and my turps yellin at him and the guy's like, got carrying a box with him.

694
00:47:19.50 --> 00:47:21.50
And he's walking towards, we're assaulting a target.

695
00:47:21.50 --> 00:47:27.50
This was in baguette where assaulting a target and this guy's walking up, looking super suspect.

696
00:47:27.50 --> 00:47:33.50
And my turps like, hey, there's 50 cows pointed at him and like, like, hey, and so finally,

697
00:47:33.50 --> 00:47:37.50
I just like, well, I just like aggressively approach him.

698
00:47:37.50 --> 00:47:41.50
And, no, we told him to put the box down so he sets the box down on his feet.

699
00:47:41.50 --> 00:47:49.50
And I get over, so I go like, grab this guy and as I'm going to grab him, he like pulls something out of his pocket.

700
00:47:49.50 --> 00:47:51.50
And I'm so close to him, I had my weapon.

701
00:47:51.50 --> 00:47:57.50
I like smashed his hand with my weapon and he dropped this little remote that he used carrying.

702
00:47:57.50 --> 00:47:59.50
And yeah, it sounds all cool.

703
00:47:59.50 --> 00:48:00.50
Here's the deal, though.

704
00:48:00.50 --> 00:48:04.50
This dude was drunk. Once we got to the bottom of it, he was drunk.

705
00:48:04.50 --> 00:48:08.50
And in the box was a video machine and he had been over his buddy's house to watch him porno

706
00:48:08.50 --> 00:48:10.50
and getting drunk with his buddy.

707
00:48:10.50 --> 00:48:12.50
You know, I am a smoked him.

708
00:48:12.50 --> 00:48:14.50
You know, you got to deserve it.

709
00:48:14.50 --> 00:48:16.50
They do some dumb shit, man.

710
00:48:16.50 --> 00:48:18.50
And so you never know.

711
00:48:18.50 --> 00:48:22.50
So what you're saying is since you had a little bit of experience driving up there,

712
00:48:22.50 --> 00:48:27.50
the guys that arrived via air were sort of had to get used to going out in town.

713
00:48:27.50 --> 00:48:30.50
Yeah, they didn't experience the end of the culture.

714
00:48:30.50 --> 00:48:34.50
You know, or at least even not necessarily that we experienced, but even get a taste of.

715
00:48:34.50 --> 00:48:37.50
So their first time interacting was maybe not the best day.

716
00:48:37.50 --> 00:48:40.50
You know, and we got to have kind of ease into it a little bit.

717
00:48:40.50 --> 00:48:42.50
So then what was your date?

718
00:48:42.50 --> 00:48:43.50
What was your mission?

719
00:48:43.50 --> 00:48:48.50
So your mission as a PSD guy was to protect people, you know, important people,

720
00:48:48.50 --> 00:48:52.50
whether that's a batain commander, a brigade commander, support,

721
00:48:52.50 --> 00:48:54.50
I don't know, support EOD cleanances.

722
00:48:54.50 --> 00:48:55.50
That was basically what you were doing.

723
00:48:55.50 --> 00:48:58.50
Yeah, and well, yeah, but then,

724
00:48:58.50 --> 00:49:02.50
come in, the, our principles never really left.

725
00:49:02.50 --> 00:49:05.50
So we ended up just doing whatever came down.

726
00:49:05.50 --> 00:49:09.50
Lots, lots of QRF stuff, lots of EOD support.

727
00:49:09.50 --> 00:49:14.50
Quite a few like log packs, those are the most miserable missions on the entire.

728
00:49:14.50 --> 00:49:16.50
You can get drive all the way around Lake Havana.

729
00:49:16.50 --> 00:49:20.50
And absolutely nothing's going to happen except for you getting smoked with an ID.

730
00:49:20.50 --> 00:49:24.50
And like there's just, yeah, those were terrible because they're boring.

731
00:49:24.50 --> 00:49:26.50
And it's just like a crapshoot.

732
00:49:26.50 --> 00:49:28.50
Yeah, boring and waiting to die at the same time.

733
00:49:28.50 --> 00:49:30.50
Yeah, it's like the worst.

734
00:49:30.50 --> 00:49:33.50
So that's like mostly what we were doing.

735
00:49:33.50 --> 00:49:37.50
And then we, you know, few raids come down here and there and need somebody.

736
00:49:37.50 --> 00:49:38.50
We go to that stuff.

737
00:49:38.50 --> 00:49:42.50
What was your opt-emple? Like, it's varied a lot.

738
00:49:42.50 --> 00:49:44.50
Yeah, it's just varied a ton.

739
00:49:44.50 --> 00:49:47.50
It's dependent, like, we're doing like prisoner transport,

740
00:49:47.50 --> 00:49:49.50
then that would be like a two day boring ass thing,

741
00:49:49.50 --> 00:49:51.50
same kind of thing with log packs.

742
00:49:51.50 --> 00:49:54.50
But then if we were back home and there was not that going on,

743
00:49:54.50 --> 00:49:56.50
then we might have a little higher opt-emple.

744
00:49:56.50 --> 00:49:58.50
You know, the sweat was coming in and out.

745
00:49:58.50 --> 00:50:00.50
But you were basically work, would you say you're working every day?

746
00:50:00.50 --> 00:50:01.50
Yeah, for sure.

747
00:50:01.50 --> 00:50:02.50
Definitely working every day.

748
00:50:02.50 --> 00:50:04.50
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

749
00:50:04.50 --> 00:50:05.50
Rollin' out.

750
00:50:05.50 --> 00:50:06.50
I don't think they'd get out of the day.

751
00:50:06.50 --> 00:50:08.50
Yeah, I don't think we ought to die off.

752
00:50:08.50 --> 00:50:12.50
And so they brought in, I don't know if they just, you guys probably not.

753
00:50:12.50 --> 00:50:15.50
But they ended up bringing in shrinks.

754
00:50:15.50 --> 00:50:18.50
I can't remember what month, it might've been December.

755
00:50:18.50 --> 00:50:20.50
I can't remember what month it was.

756
00:50:20.50 --> 00:50:23.50
Anyway, they ended up bringing in shrinks to, like,

757
00:50:23.50 --> 00:50:26.50
that the army would start to have a problem with PTSD stuff on that home,

758
00:50:26.50 --> 00:50:29.50
whether it's still kind of PTSD aspect, then I think.

759
00:50:29.50 --> 00:50:31.50
And so they brought in these shrinks.

760
00:50:31.50 --> 00:50:34.50
And it was like, if you've done this many missions outside of the wire

761
00:50:34.50 --> 00:50:37.50
in this amount of time, then they were pulling you off the line

762
00:50:37.50 --> 00:50:41.50
and putting you, like, on a guard tower for how long, two weeks.

763
00:50:41.50 --> 00:50:42.50
And enough for one.

764
00:50:42.50 --> 00:50:45.50
Yeah, and when they did that with us, I was told my first son

765
00:50:45.50 --> 00:50:48.50
of my top business, the steepest should have ever heard of my life.

766
00:50:48.50 --> 00:50:55.50
You can't, I mean, yeah, you don't want to come in and just get soft, you know.

767
00:50:55.50 --> 00:50:57.50
Yeah, I think so.

768
00:50:57.50 --> 00:51:02.50
Yeah, and then also, you might start to not want to go back out again

769
00:51:02.50 --> 00:51:05.50
because, you know, you get that, you get time to think about it.

770
00:51:05.50 --> 00:51:07.50
And haunt, yeah.

771
00:51:07.50 --> 00:51:14.50
Was there any missions that you did that stood out to you that were particularly

772
00:51:14.50 --> 00:51:17.50
interesting or important missions?

773
00:51:17.50 --> 00:51:18.50
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

774
00:51:18.50 --> 00:51:19.50
And so, you know, I was not really, man.

775
00:51:19.50 --> 00:51:21.50
And we did, I, how's the normal door guy, man?

776
00:51:21.50 --> 00:51:23.50
And I'm doing a lot of cool stuff.

777
00:51:23.50 --> 00:51:27.50
We did a raid with, we just supported first Marine Recom, one time on a raid

778
00:51:27.50 --> 00:51:30.50
between Ramadi and the Syrian border.

779
00:51:30.50 --> 00:51:34.50
They, someone, once we got predator drones, they discovered this compound out there

780
00:51:34.50 --> 00:51:35.50
that nobody even knew existed.

781
00:51:35.50 --> 00:51:36.50
It was like, I'm sand dunes.

782
00:51:36.50 --> 00:51:39.50
I think called it Big Wally Farm, I think.

783
00:51:39.50 --> 00:51:43.50
I hope that's not, and that's something like some classified shit or something

784
00:51:43.50 --> 00:51:49.50
I don't think Big Wally Farm could be that kind of stuff.

785
00:51:49.50 --> 00:51:52.50
If it is, they need to work on their freaking classification.

786
00:51:52.50 --> 00:51:53.50
Well, I know, that's what we call it.

787
00:51:53.50 --> 00:51:55.50
Okay, they did it.

788
00:51:55.50 --> 00:51:59.50
So, yeah, I mean, that was cool.

789
00:51:59.50 --> 00:52:03.50
Watching Recon take that down was pretty cool, but like we just did normal

790
00:52:03.50 --> 00:52:07.50
like day to day, trying not to get blown up, you know, try to shoot the

791
00:52:07.50 --> 00:52:12.50
people, the need to get shot and not the ones that don't.

792
00:52:12.50 --> 00:52:16.50
I mean, just really it was kind of, that's why when I was writing the book,

793
00:52:16.50 --> 00:52:22.50
you know, I had just like a very basic normal guy as soldiers story.

794
00:52:22.50 --> 00:52:26.50
So I don't think there was any, for me, it didn't seem like there was any sense

795
00:52:26.50 --> 00:52:30.50
and going into all these little minor, you know, this day we got shot out here.

796
00:52:30.50 --> 00:52:33.50
Like first time I took sniper fire was for sure memorable.

797
00:52:33.50 --> 00:52:35.50
In fact, I'll tell you that's really, really quick.

798
00:52:35.50 --> 00:52:38.50
We were out on during a trip to Recon.

799
00:52:38.50 --> 00:52:41.50
It was just outside of the Northgate.

800
00:52:41.50 --> 00:52:45.50
So before they had fortified that, we just had a, we just had like a big

801
00:52:45.50 --> 00:52:47.50
Texas barrier up there.

802
00:52:47.50 --> 00:52:52.50
And we were just sitting there waiting, I can't remember where the heck we were going,

803
00:52:52.50 --> 00:52:55.50
but we were staged to go somewhere.

804
00:52:55.50 --> 00:52:56.50
Yeah.

805
00:52:56.50 --> 00:53:00.50
And anyway, we'd take two, one round first and then another round,

806
00:53:00.50 --> 00:53:04.50
but it goes right over my gunner's head who was sitting in the

807
00:53:04.50 --> 00:53:08.50
Humvee on the gun, you know, but he's just daydream and, you know,

808
00:53:08.50 --> 00:53:11.50
he goes right through, they had a piece of camel netting.

809
00:53:11.50 --> 00:53:14.50
He goes right through the camel netting and he hit.

810
00:53:14.50 --> 00:53:18.50
And he, he looked like, when you, if you ever slaughtered bull when you shoot him,

811
00:53:18.50 --> 00:53:21.50
and that's almost like their legs come up and they hit the ground like a cart

812
00:53:21.50 --> 00:53:22.50
team.

813
00:53:22.50 --> 00:53:23.50
That's like what he did.

814
00:53:23.50 --> 00:53:24.50
We thought he was dead, man.

815
00:53:24.50 --> 00:53:28.50
Like he just piled up in that Humvee.

816
00:53:28.50 --> 00:53:31.50
And so I was like, where's the shooting from?

817
00:53:31.50 --> 00:53:32.50
Where's the shoot from?

818
00:53:32.50 --> 00:53:34.50
And I was like trying to find where he's coming from,

819
00:53:34.50 --> 00:53:37.50
but also not keep my head out for, you know, five minutes at a time.

820
00:53:37.50 --> 00:53:41.50
So like moving from side to side up and down, just trying to

821
00:53:41.50 --> 00:53:44.50
peat and then finally I said, the only thing this could be is this covert.

822
00:53:44.50 --> 00:53:47.50
Like there's nothing else to get possibly be.

823
00:53:47.50 --> 00:53:53.50
So we radio up and we radio up, mora, okay, we're going to go get this,

824
00:53:53.50 --> 00:53:56.50
you know, this is, this is, we're going to go check this covert.

825
00:53:56.50 --> 00:53:58.50
It's the only place we can figure that we get shot at from.

826
00:53:58.50 --> 00:54:02.50
Now, it's also possible that he was just like out in the desert somewhere.

827
00:54:02.50 --> 00:54:04.50
I'm shooting further than we thought they were capable of.

828
00:54:04.50 --> 00:54:08.50
But when you see a handful of Iraqi shoot night, it was like, they case with no front sight post.

829
00:54:08.50 --> 00:54:12.50
You think they're pulling off the 1100 yard shots.

830
00:54:12.50 --> 00:54:15.50
You're looking at that covert that's 200 yard shots.

831
00:54:15.50 --> 00:54:17.50
There he is.

832
00:54:17.50 --> 00:54:22.50
So we, the captain is like, I want to go out with you guys.

833
00:54:22.50 --> 00:54:24.50
I'm like, oh my gosh.

834
00:54:24.50 --> 00:54:25.50
Okay.

835
00:54:25.50 --> 00:54:30.50
So we wait and we wait, it had to be 15, 20 minutes had to be.

836
00:54:30.50 --> 00:54:32.50
Wait and for the captain to show up had to be.

837
00:54:32.50 --> 00:54:34.50
Could have been longer.

838
00:54:34.50 --> 00:54:36.50
So by the time he gets there, we're all talking.

839
00:54:36.50 --> 00:54:38.50
I don't know why his dude's still there.

840
00:54:38.50 --> 00:54:39.50
There's no freak way.

841
00:54:39.50 --> 00:54:41.50
He's just in a lay there for 20 minutes.

842
00:54:41.50 --> 00:54:44.50
Like, he's, they're dumb, but they're not that dumb.

843
00:54:44.50 --> 00:54:48.50
So the captain gets there and we roll out and he's like, okay, you know,

844
00:54:48.50 --> 00:54:52.50
we've got truck here, truck here on the side of the covert.

845
00:54:52.50 --> 00:54:56.50
And I was like, I'll go in and I pull the flash bang out.

846
00:54:56.50 --> 00:54:58.50
And he goes, we don't shoot till that flash bang in there.

847
00:54:58.50 --> 00:55:00.50
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

848
00:55:00.50 --> 00:55:02.50
You XO or XU mean, ID in there.

849
00:55:02.50 --> 00:55:04.50
No, it's like, okay.

850
00:55:04.50 --> 00:55:08.50
He's like, why won't you set this ID off over standing on it?

851
00:55:08.50 --> 00:55:12.50
And I was like, dude, I'm not going in that without throwing a bang or something.

852
00:55:12.50 --> 00:55:16.50
I think I'd much rather have the flash bang set the ID off.

853
00:55:16.50 --> 00:55:18.50
Then my goal is, yeah, I know.

854
00:55:18.50 --> 00:55:20.50
It's like, it's not happening then.

855
00:55:20.50 --> 00:55:24.50
And he goes, if you throw that flash bang in there,

856
00:55:24.50 --> 00:55:26.50
I'll write you an arc of 15.

857
00:55:26.50 --> 00:55:28.50
And I said, get your fucking hand out.

858
00:55:28.50 --> 00:55:32.50
I'm swear, I know it sounds pretend I swear, God.

859
00:55:32.50 --> 00:55:34.50
It's like throw it in there and the side you know, it's true,

860
00:55:34.50 --> 00:55:34.50
it's true.

861
00:55:34.50 --> 00:55:36.50
It's true, it's stuck in there.

862
00:55:36.50 --> 00:55:36.50
And I jump off.

863
00:55:36.50 --> 00:55:42.50
Johnny comes in, I mean, we're going in and I panicked myself.

864
00:55:42.50 --> 00:55:44.50
It's like, saw my own banger.

865
00:55:44.50 --> 00:55:45.50
And I thought it was UXO.

866
00:55:45.50 --> 00:55:48.50
So I was like, UXO, UXO, UXO, trying to back out and Johnny's like,

867
00:55:48.50 --> 00:55:49.50
what?

868
00:55:49.50 --> 00:55:50.50
Like UXO?

869
00:55:50.50 --> 00:55:52.50
He's like, sure's my fucking fire back.

870
00:55:52.50 --> 00:55:56.50
Yeah, I'm like, I'm exposed to unexploded ordinance.

871
00:55:56.50 --> 00:55:58.50
So he flew his flash bang in there.

872
00:55:58.50 --> 00:56:00.50
It went off, but there's still like little chunks of it.

873
00:56:00.50 --> 00:56:02.50
You know, better sit there.

874
00:56:02.50 --> 00:56:04.50
He's not that dumb.

875
00:56:04.50 --> 00:56:06.50
Backed out to get his freaking article on it.

876
00:56:06.50 --> 00:56:08.50
Yeah.

877
00:56:08.50 --> 00:56:09.50
Yeah.

878
00:56:09.50 --> 00:56:10.50
Yeah, that's classic.

879
00:56:10.50 --> 00:56:12.50
He, and that captain was good dude.

880
00:56:12.50 --> 00:56:14.50
He just, I don't know what he was thinking on that one.

881
00:56:14.50 --> 00:56:16.50
He didn't write me an arc of 15.

882
00:56:16.50 --> 00:56:17.50
Yeah.

883
00:56:17.50 --> 00:56:18.50
I mean, man, it's hard.

884
00:56:18.50 --> 00:56:21.50
I'm assuming that he was fresh in country as well.

885
00:56:21.50 --> 00:56:22.50
Oh, yeah, he was young, man.

886
00:56:22.50 --> 00:56:25.50
You have no idea of like, what's going on when you first

887
00:56:25.50 --> 00:56:28.50
get in country, you have just no idea.

888
00:56:28.50 --> 00:56:29.50
It's hard.

889
00:56:29.50 --> 00:56:32.50
And a young guy like, he was a 25 or something.

890
00:56:32.50 --> 00:56:33.50
24.

891
00:56:33.50 --> 00:56:34.50
Yeah, I don't know how old are they.

892
00:56:34.50 --> 00:56:36.50
Roughly when they got something like that.

893
00:56:36.50 --> 00:56:38.50
Probably maybe 28, maybe 26.

894
00:56:38.50 --> 00:56:39.50
Something like that.

895
00:56:39.50 --> 00:56:41.50
But yeah, he's not all takes four years.

896
00:56:41.50 --> 00:56:45.50
Takes four years to make captain or a make-o-three.

897
00:56:45.50 --> 00:56:46.50
So he might have been 20.

898
00:56:46.50 --> 00:56:48.50
Yeah, so he's like 24, maybe 25.

899
00:56:48.50 --> 00:56:49.50
Yeah.

900
00:56:49.50 --> 00:56:49.50
Yeah.

901
00:56:49.50 --> 00:56:51.50
And he doesn't leave wires, you know.

902
00:56:51.50 --> 00:56:53.50
He's running a battery.

903
00:56:53.50 --> 00:56:56.50
Like he's a, you know.

904
00:56:56.50 --> 00:57:00.50
You know, just on what you said earlier about hey, you were just a regular soldier.

905
00:57:00.50 --> 00:57:05.50
All of my guys, we all just, we all looked at you all like,

906
00:57:05.50 --> 00:57:08.50
damn, because you guys were out going out there like you said,

907
00:57:08.50 --> 00:57:13.50
every single day you're going out there to do random searches of culverts

908
00:57:13.50 --> 00:57:14.50
where you were just taking fire from.

909
00:57:14.50 --> 00:57:17.50
Just like shit like that on the daily basis.

910
00:57:17.50 --> 00:57:22.50
And we just held all of you guys in the highest regard.

911
00:57:22.50 --> 00:57:25.50
For what you guys were doing every single day.

912
00:57:25.50 --> 00:57:29.50
You know, we'd come back and we'd go out and open come back and we had good

913
00:57:29.50 --> 00:57:32.50
chow and a place to chill out a little bit.

914
00:57:32.50 --> 00:57:36.50
And if a guy was like tired, it was like, okay, you know.

915
00:57:36.50 --> 00:57:40.50
And you guys just getting that task every single day.

916
00:57:40.50 --> 00:57:44.50
There's another thing I've talked about where it's like,

917
00:57:44.50 --> 00:57:49.50
I don't know which one of these, there's a different psychological impact.

918
00:57:49.50 --> 00:57:52.50
A lot of times army guys like we'd be working with army potins and they're like,

919
00:57:52.50 --> 00:57:54.50
oh, this is what we're going to task to do.

920
00:57:54.50 --> 00:57:55.50
But we're going to go out and patrol this area.

921
00:57:55.50 --> 00:57:57.50
We're going to go out and clear this block.

922
00:57:57.50 --> 00:57:57.50
We're going to go out.

923
00:57:57.50 --> 00:57:59.50
They're just getting tasked with what they're going to do.

924
00:57:59.50 --> 00:58:01.50
They don't have any real saying it.

925
00:58:01.50 --> 00:58:04.50
And we had a complete complete control.

926
00:58:04.50 --> 00:58:06.50
Like, oh, this is what we want to do.

927
00:58:06.50 --> 00:58:07.50
Then we'll go do it.

928
00:58:07.50 --> 00:58:09.50
If we didn't want to go do it, we wouldn't go do it.

929
00:58:09.50 --> 00:58:12.50
Like pretty much, we just made up what we wanted to do.

930
00:58:12.50 --> 00:58:16.50
And there's pros to that because you know,

931
00:58:16.50 --> 00:58:18.50
you can say, hey, I don't think this is a good time to do that.

932
00:58:18.50 --> 00:58:22.50
But it also when something happens, it's 100% because you said,

933
00:58:22.50 --> 00:58:24.50
hey, this is what we're going to do.

934
00:58:24.50 --> 00:58:27.50
So there's a different psychological impact

935
00:58:27.50 --> 00:58:31.50
depending on who you are of how it ends up in your brain.

936
00:58:31.50 --> 00:58:34.50
Because for us anyways, on that deployment,

937
00:58:34.50 --> 00:58:36.50
we did what we wanted to do.

938
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:39.50
We picked and chose exactly what we wanted to do.

939
00:58:39.50 --> 00:58:41.50
We watched army guys get in task.

940
00:58:41.50 --> 00:58:42.50
Hey, you're going to go out.

941
00:58:42.50 --> 00:58:44.50
You know, that road you got ID it on yesterday?

942
00:58:44.50 --> 00:58:46.50
Yeah, you're going down it again today.

943
00:58:46.50 --> 00:58:49.50
You know, the one you got ID two times before that,

944
00:58:49.50 --> 00:58:50.50
you're going down that one as well.

945
00:58:50.50 --> 00:58:54.50
And guys just had to grit their teeth and oftentimes,

946
00:58:54.50 --> 00:58:56.50
just that was the mission that go executed.

947
00:58:56.50 --> 00:58:59.50
We had more flexibility, but then again, like I said,

948
00:58:59.50 --> 00:59:01.50
that means when something does go wrong,

949
00:59:01.50 --> 00:59:04.50
there's only, it's 100% on me as,

950
00:59:04.50 --> 00:59:05.50
that's my mission.

951
00:59:05.50 --> 00:59:07.50
I'm a proven it. Let's go.

952
00:59:07.50 --> 00:59:11.50
But yeah, you guys, you know, you talking about you just being a normal,

953
00:59:11.50 --> 00:59:14.50
oh, I didn't do it, didn't do much, there's no big deal.

954
00:59:14.50 --> 00:59:18.50
Going out there every single day into that city is,

955
00:59:18.50 --> 00:59:22.50
freaking salute to all you guys.

956
00:59:22.50 --> 00:59:25.50
How often would you say you were taking contact when you guys

957
00:59:25.50 --> 00:59:26.50
go out?

958
00:59:26.50 --> 00:59:30.50
We didn't, a lot of guys got away worse than us.

959
00:59:30.50 --> 00:59:32.50
We didn't take a lot.

960
00:59:32.50 --> 00:59:35.50
We really didn't take a lot, because we would also end up

961
00:59:35.50 --> 00:59:37.50
on dumbass, like a log patch, you know,

962
00:59:37.50 --> 00:59:39.50
like I'm saying. So then we're way out and,

963
00:59:39.50 --> 00:59:41.50
to quantum, but even on stuff like that,

964
00:59:41.50 --> 00:59:45.50
it's like ID every single time, every other time or something.

965
00:59:45.50 --> 00:59:49.50
But in town, I mean, I don't know if,

966
00:59:49.50 --> 00:59:52.50
I don't know if anybody didn't at least get shot at,

967
00:59:52.50 --> 00:59:56.50
everything like, you couldn't, you sure as hell could not go down

968
00:59:56.50 --> 00:59:59.50
route Michigan and not at least have someone to shoot at.

969
00:59:59.50 --> 01:00:03.50
I had some guys over at Eastern Remadi,

970
01:00:03.50 --> 01:00:08.50
and I was briefing the kernel of the siege of so-and-of awesome guy.

971
01:00:08.50 --> 01:00:11.50
And I was just briefing them on what we were doing, how we were doing it.

972
01:00:11.50 --> 01:00:16.50
And I said, you know, sir, my element that's out in Eastern Remadi,

973
01:00:16.50 --> 01:00:21.50
they've been contacted by the enemy the last 23 operations in a row.

974
01:00:21.50 --> 01:00:24.50
And then my intel guy, or my talk guy,

975
01:00:24.50 --> 01:00:26.50
came in like, while I'm saying that,

976
01:00:26.50 --> 01:00:28.50
and they're like, sort of just to let you know,

977
01:00:28.50 --> 01:00:30.50
troops and contacts in the guys, and he has like,

978
01:00:30.50 --> 01:00:33.50
I said, sir, make that 24 times in a row.

979
01:00:33.50 --> 01:00:36.50
So yeah, you were going to definitely going to,

980
01:00:36.50 --> 01:00:38.50
and enemy was there. Yeah. Yeah.

981
01:00:38.50 --> 01:00:39.50
The enemy was definitely there.

982
01:00:39.50 --> 01:00:41.50
Well, it didn't help that everyone was just

983
01:00:41.50 --> 01:00:43.50
retaken the same ground every day.

984
01:00:43.50 --> 01:00:47.50
I mean, and every, every idiot on the line was saying it,

985
01:00:47.50 --> 01:00:50.50
you know, this makes absolutely no sense.

986
01:00:50.50 --> 01:00:52.50
Well, what we doing, you know,

987
01:00:52.50 --> 01:00:55.50
we eventually ended up starting setting up cops and stuff like this,

988
01:00:55.50 --> 01:00:59.50
but in the beginning it was just essentially a glorified presence,

989
01:00:59.50 --> 01:01:01.50
but for a long-term presence at the troll.

990
01:01:01.50 --> 01:01:03.50
It's just very stupid stuff.

991
01:01:03.50 --> 01:01:06.50
But yeah, I mean, like I say, other guys are doing way more than we were to,

992
01:01:06.50 --> 01:01:08.50
so I way more or so.

993
01:01:08.50 --> 01:01:10.50
From a leadership perspective,

994
01:01:10.50 --> 01:01:12.50
would you see from the good leaders that you work for?

995
01:01:12.50 --> 01:01:15.50
Would you notice about what made you want to follow?

996
01:01:15.50 --> 01:01:20.50
Integrity is huge.

997
01:01:20.50 --> 01:01:23.50
When somebody is from a leadership perspective,

998
01:01:23.50 --> 01:01:26.50
I actually maybe integrates not through the right word.

999
01:01:26.50 --> 01:01:27.50
Yeah.

1000
01:01:27.50 --> 01:01:34.50
If when you start seeing your, like your brass bullshit in you,

1001
01:01:34.50 --> 01:01:38.50
you know, it's, I mean, it's really hard to get that trust back.

1002
01:01:38.50 --> 01:01:39.50
Like just don't bullshit.

1003
01:01:39.50 --> 01:01:40.50
It made tell me what it is.

1004
01:01:40.50 --> 01:01:42.50
I mean, I don't want to name anybody here,

1005
01:01:42.50 --> 01:01:45.50
even tell certain stories, but there was a couple of words like man,

1006
01:01:45.50 --> 01:01:46.50
what are you doing?

1007
01:01:46.50 --> 01:01:48.50
You know,

1008
01:01:48.50 --> 01:01:52.50
and here's this a little warning for leaders.

1009
01:01:52.50 --> 01:01:56.50
If you think that your frontline troops don't know when you're lying to them,

1010
01:01:56.50 --> 01:01:58.50
you're so wrong.

1011
01:01:58.50 --> 01:02:00.50
You tell that frontline troop that,

1012
01:02:00.50 --> 01:02:01.50
hey, they'll know,

1013
01:02:01.50 --> 01:02:02.50
this is no, don't worry,

1014
01:02:02.50 --> 01:02:03.50
because we're going to do this later,

1015
01:02:03.50 --> 01:02:05.50
or this is what's really happening.

1016
01:02:05.50 --> 01:02:07.50
Everybody can see right through it.

1017
01:02:07.50 --> 01:02:09.50
So if you're lying to your people,

1018
01:02:09.50 --> 01:02:13.50
they're going to know you're not smarter than them.

1019
01:02:13.50 --> 01:02:14.50
They know exactly what's happening,

1020
01:02:14.50 --> 01:02:16.50
and you can't bullshit these guys.

1021
01:02:16.50 --> 01:02:18.50
So don't try and do it.

1022
01:02:18.50 --> 01:02:19.50
Yeah, like one time,

1023
01:02:19.50 --> 01:02:21.50
one of them came up with this plan,

1024
01:02:21.50 --> 01:02:22.50
I don't want to say it,

1025
01:02:22.50 --> 01:02:25.50
but you call it the operation decoy.

1026
01:02:25.50 --> 01:02:28.50
And we had a patchy gunships for the day,

1027
01:02:28.50 --> 01:02:29.50
but it was like,

1028
01:02:29.50 --> 01:02:31.50
so it was a two weeks out or something.

1029
01:02:31.50 --> 01:02:36.50
And the plan was that our team will just take our trucks

1030
01:02:36.50 --> 01:02:38.50
and roll through until like I do,

1031
01:02:38.50 --> 01:02:39.50
as we went off.

1032
01:02:39.50 --> 01:02:40.50
You know,

1033
01:02:40.50 --> 01:02:41.50
my hopeful you see him, right?

1034
01:02:41.50 --> 01:02:42.50
But,

1035
01:02:42.50 --> 01:02:44.50
well, I listen to him.

1036
01:02:44.50 --> 01:02:47.50
You're going to lead vehicle bitch.

1037
01:02:47.50 --> 01:02:49.50
You're like, what is this?

1038
01:02:49.50 --> 01:02:50.50
You know,

1039
01:02:50.50 --> 01:02:52.50
like you just happy you got some helicopters?

1040
01:02:52.50 --> 01:02:55.50
Yeah,

1041
01:02:55.50 --> 01:02:55.50
yeah,

1042
01:02:55.50 --> 01:02:56.50
we end up not having to do that one,

1043
01:02:56.50 --> 01:02:58.50
but that was legitimately the plan.

1044
01:02:58.50 --> 01:02:59.50
And yeah,

1045
01:02:59.50 --> 01:03:01.50
my NCO is like,

1046
01:03:01.50 --> 01:03:02.50
you can bust me,

1047
01:03:02.50 --> 01:03:04.50
we're not doing this.

1048
01:03:04.50 --> 01:03:06.50
Check.

1049
01:03:06.50 --> 01:03:08.50
With that,

1050
01:03:08.50 --> 01:03:12.50
that kind of covers some of the stuff leading up to anything.

1051
01:03:12.50 --> 01:03:14.50
That's you want to cover leading up the glass factory?

1052
01:03:14.50 --> 01:03:15.50
No, that's fine.

1053
01:03:15.50 --> 01:03:16.50
All right.

1054
01:03:16.50 --> 01:03:18.50
Let's get into this book, man.

1055
01:03:18.50 --> 01:03:19.50
Again,

1056
01:03:19.50 --> 01:03:20.50
book is called the Glass Factory.

1057
01:03:20.50 --> 01:03:25.50
You're going to hear me read parts of it that it is got.

1058
01:03:25.50 --> 01:03:26.50
It's great.

1059
01:03:26.50 --> 01:03:27.50
It's great story.

1060
01:03:27.50 --> 01:03:29.50
You're a great storyteller,

1061
01:03:29.50 --> 01:03:32.50
but the internal dialogue that's going on in here

1062
01:03:32.50 --> 01:03:34.50
of what your thoughts are,

1063
01:03:34.50 --> 01:03:38.50
the progress you're making as a person is,

1064
01:03:38.50 --> 01:03:40.50
it's just an outstanding book.

1065
01:03:40.50 --> 01:03:41.50
So get the book.

1066
01:03:41.50 --> 01:03:43.50
Here we go in.

1067
01:03:43.50 --> 01:03:45.50
The glass factory

1068
01:03:45.50 --> 01:03:46.50
starts like this.

1069
01:03:46.50 --> 01:03:49.50
The whole recruitment push had gone smashingly thus far,

1070
01:03:49.50 --> 01:03:52.50
but we were on our fourth day of this same drive,

1071
01:03:52.50 --> 01:03:54.50
and we had already hugely surpassed

1072
01:03:54.50 --> 01:03:57.50
our initial goal of 200 new recruits.

1073
01:03:57.50 --> 01:04:00.50
The men of Ramadi had lined up in droves for the opportunity

1074
01:04:00.50 --> 01:04:03.50
to become one of the guys chosen to fly to Jordan

1075
01:04:03.50 --> 01:04:05.50
for the high speed training the US government.

1076
01:04:05.50 --> 01:04:06.50
They funded for them,

1077
01:04:06.50 --> 01:04:09.50
and later returned to their hometown to clean it up.

1078
01:04:09.50 --> 01:04:11.50
In fact,

1079
01:04:11.50 --> 01:04:13.50
we had processed hundreds of candidates already.

1080
01:04:13.50 --> 01:04:14.50
The catch was,

1081
01:04:14.50 --> 01:04:18.50
this was going to be day four of this particular mission,

1082
01:04:18.50 --> 01:04:23.50
and we had only been promised three peaceful days.

1083
01:04:23.50 --> 01:04:27.50
The problem was all the spots that we had for these future

1084
01:04:27.50 --> 01:04:30.50
Iraqi police had been filled days ago.

1085
01:04:30.50 --> 01:04:33.50
This was all just for show.

1086
01:04:33.50 --> 01:04:35.50
No one on our team felt like it was a good idea

1087
01:04:35.50 --> 01:04:37.50
to put ourselves at risk for almost nothing,

1088
01:04:37.50 --> 01:04:38.50
but we were soldiers,

1089
01:04:38.50 --> 01:04:40.50
and that's just part of the job,

1090
01:04:40.50 --> 01:04:42.50
or so we are told.

1091
01:04:42.50 --> 01:04:45.50
When we got into our home via Crack to Joke,

1092
01:04:45.50 --> 01:04:47.50
well, let's go get blown up boys.

1093
01:04:47.50 --> 01:04:50.50
I was just trying to cut the tension,

1094
01:04:50.50 --> 01:04:52.50
probably more than any others,

1095
01:04:52.50 --> 01:04:55.50
but I'm not sure it had the desired effect.

1096
01:04:55.50 --> 01:04:58.50
Actually,

1097
01:04:58.50 --> 01:05:00.50
talking to General Gronsky on here,

1098
01:05:00.50 --> 01:05:02.50
he talks about the fact that,

1099
01:05:02.50 --> 01:05:04.50
as he looks back, he's like,

1100
01:05:04.50 --> 01:05:05.50
I,

1101
01:05:05.50 --> 01:05:07.50
four days and no, didn't need it.

1102
01:05:07.50 --> 01:05:08.50
Chin and none.

1103
01:05:08.50 --> 01:05:10.50
You know, that's what he feels.

1104
01:05:10.50 --> 01:05:12.50
That's what he said.

1105
01:05:12.50 --> 01:05:14.50
And you know, you're in a,

1106
01:05:14.50 --> 01:05:16.50
I mean, hindsight's always 2020.

1107
01:05:16.50 --> 01:05:19.50
Well, I know why I did it though.

1108
01:05:19.50 --> 01:05:23.50
The thing that was frustrating for us was

1109
01:05:23.50 --> 01:05:24.50
day two,

1110
01:05:24.50 --> 01:05:25.50
they had shot us,

1111
01:05:25.50 --> 01:05:27.50
I mean, they missed wildly,

1112
01:05:27.50 --> 01:05:28.50
but they shot us with rockets,

1113
01:05:28.50 --> 01:05:29.50
and then day three,

1114
01:05:29.50 --> 01:05:30.50
and that's just,

1115
01:05:30.50 --> 01:05:32.50
I mean, maybe they were just shooting a camp for a long,

1116
01:05:32.50 --> 01:05:34.50
like I said, they missed wildly.

1117
01:05:34.50 --> 01:05:37.50
Day three, two dudes sat at the bus stop

1118
01:05:37.50 --> 01:05:38.50
for like four hours,

1119
01:05:38.50 --> 01:05:39.50
and we reported it up.

1120
01:05:39.50 --> 01:05:40.50
And I mean,

1121
01:05:40.50 --> 01:05:41.50
first of all,

1122
01:05:41.50 --> 01:05:42.50
what are they waiting for?

1123
01:05:42.50 --> 01:05:43.50
You know?

1124
01:05:43.50 --> 01:05:45.50
So anyway, we reported that up,

1125
01:05:45.50 --> 01:05:46.50
and, but the reason that you know,

1126
01:05:46.50 --> 01:05:47.50
to defend Gronsky here,

1127
01:05:47.50 --> 01:05:49.50
the reason that he went on with it is we had

1128
01:05:49.50 --> 01:05:52.50
guys process and queer up until like midnight.

1129
01:05:52.50 --> 01:05:53.50
And it was dark,

1130
01:05:53.50 --> 01:05:56.50
and we turned away a couple hundred people got it.

1131
01:05:56.50 --> 01:05:59.50
So he didn't want them to feel like they didn't have the opportunity.

1132
01:05:59.50 --> 01:06:02.50
Even though no one was having the opportunity by then,

1133
01:06:02.50 --> 01:06:03.50
but just the show of that,

1134
01:06:03.50 --> 01:06:04.50
at least that's,

1135
01:06:04.50 --> 01:06:05.50
that was my take.

1136
01:06:05.50 --> 01:06:08.50
And then just from a strategic perspective here,

1137
01:06:08.50 --> 01:06:11.50
the goal was to have the local people

1138
01:06:11.50 --> 01:06:13.50
from Ramadi,

1139
01:06:13.50 --> 01:06:15.50
join our Ramadi police,

1140
01:06:15.50 --> 01:06:17.50
and then police up their own city.

1141
01:06:17.50 --> 01:06:18.50
So they could,

1142
01:06:18.50 --> 01:06:20.50
they could fight against the insurgents there.

1143
01:06:20.50 --> 01:06:21.50
And as you said,

1144
01:06:21.50 --> 01:06:23.50
there's hundreds of them that showed up.

1145
01:06:23.50 --> 01:06:24.50
So that's pretty awesome.

1146
01:06:24.50 --> 01:06:25.50
That's a pretty great feeling.

1147
01:06:25.50 --> 01:06:27.50
And as all those people are showing up,

1148
01:06:27.50 --> 01:06:28.50
you want to help them.

1149
01:06:28.50 --> 01:06:30.50
And the call was made,

1150
01:06:30.50 --> 01:06:32.50
trying to get these guys in there.

1151
01:06:32.50 --> 01:06:34.50
You actually,

1152
01:06:34.50 --> 01:06:35.50
and again,

1153
01:06:35.50 --> 01:06:37.50
I'm not reading the whole book right now,

1154
01:06:37.50 --> 01:06:39.50
let people get your audio book,

1155
01:06:39.50 --> 01:06:41.50
but you had an uneasy feeling about this up.

1156
01:06:41.50 --> 01:06:42.50
Yeah, the audio.

1157
01:06:42.50 --> 01:06:43.50
Yeah,

1158
01:06:43.50 --> 01:06:44.50
In fact,

1159
01:06:44.50 --> 01:06:46.50
you wore like your winter,

1160
01:06:46.50 --> 01:06:48.50
your shitty winter warfare boots, right?

1161
01:06:48.50 --> 01:06:49.50
Those boots sucked.

1162
01:06:49.50 --> 01:06:50.50
Yeah.

1163
01:06:50.50 --> 01:06:52.50
Because you knew they're going to get cut off you.

1164
01:06:52.50 --> 01:06:53.50
So I mean,

1165
01:06:53.50 --> 01:06:55.50
that's what you're thinking anyway,

1166
01:06:55.50 --> 01:06:55.50
you know,

1167
01:06:55.50 --> 01:06:57.50
at least if you're going to live,

1168
01:06:57.50 --> 01:06:59.50
I want to keep my good boots.

1169
01:06:59.50 --> 01:07:00.50
Yeah.

1170
01:07:00.50 --> 01:07:01.50
I mean,

1171
01:07:01.50 --> 01:07:03.50
there was just too many things.

1172
01:07:03.50 --> 01:07:04.50
And then I do,

1173
01:07:04.50 --> 01:07:06.50
I don't know if it's promenation or what,

1174
01:07:06.50 --> 01:07:07.50
but you,

1175
01:07:07.50 --> 01:07:09.50
I just felt like I knew,

1176
01:07:09.50 --> 01:07:12.50
just knew.

1177
01:07:12.50 --> 01:07:13.50
Fast forward a little bit.

1178
01:07:13.50 --> 01:07:18.50
We put our team members in their places inside the glass factories walls and went out of our selves.

1179
01:07:18.50 --> 01:07:21.50
I was all the commas we walked out the gate,

1180
01:07:21.50 --> 01:07:23.50
not that I generally feared being among Iraqi people.

1181
01:07:23.50 --> 01:07:27.50
It's just in a situation like this where you're surrounded by roughly a thousand men,

1182
01:07:27.50 --> 01:07:29.50
whom you have no ability to directly communicate with,

1183
01:07:29.50 --> 01:07:32.50
things can spiral out of control very quickly.

1184
01:07:32.50 --> 01:07:36.50
The otherwise peaceful crowd could be overtaken by the chaos of the mob and an instant,

1185
01:07:36.50 --> 01:07:38.50
and that should be frightening to anybody.

1186
01:07:38.50 --> 01:07:42.50
Up and down the line of Iraqis,

1187
01:07:42.50 --> 01:07:44.50
we walked checking the crowd for threats as we went.

1188
01:07:44.50 --> 01:07:47.50
We stopped frequently to interrogate Iraqis who looked eager,

1189
01:07:47.50 --> 01:07:49.50
agitated or uncomfortable.

1190
01:07:49.50 --> 01:07:52.50
Honestly, most of them look nervous and unsettled,

1191
01:07:52.50 --> 01:07:55.50
which was perhaps the most reasonable way to feel in that moment.

1192
01:07:55.50 --> 01:07:58.50
These guys knew they were endangered just as well as we did.

1193
01:07:58.50 --> 01:08:01.50
After all, they lived in the city that we fought in.

1194
01:08:01.50 --> 01:08:05.50
The danger of terrorist attacks had become just another part of daily life

1195
01:08:05.50 --> 01:08:08.50
to the citizen of Western on bar province.

1196
01:08:08.50 --> 01:08:11.50
At one point a man approached us unheasily,

1197
01:08:11.50 --> 01:08:13.50
instantly causing my blood pressure rise.

1198
01:08:13.50 --> 01:08:16.50
He stood close to me as he began to talk too close.

1199
01:08:16.50 --> 01:08:18.50
Back up, I said, he has something to tell you,

1200
01:08:18.50 --> 01:08:22.50
Carlos and Carlos is the nickname that you guys gave to your interpreter.

1201
01:08:22.50 --> 01:08:24.50
Carlos leaned in and told me defensively,

1202
01:08:24.50 --> 01:08:26.50
grenade, you found a grenade or interpreter,

1203
01:08:26.50 --> 01:08:29.50
continued the conversation, yes, the man responded.

1204
01:08:29.50 --> 01:08:33.50
A grenade with a wire, Carlos relayed to us in English.

1205
01:08:33.50 --> 01:08:37.50
You got to be shitting me, I said, there's a fucking trip wire out here somewhere.

1206
01:08:37.50 --> 01:08:39.50
Ask him where the hell it is, Carlos.

1207
01:08:39.50 --> 01:08:42.50
Carlos turned to the man and asked, but we,

1208
01:08:42.50 --> 01:08:45.50
but they were having a hard time communicating because the guy was so scared.

1209
01:08:45.50 --> 01:08:47.50
It was like watching a kindergarten,

1210
01:08:47.50 --> 01:08:50.50
Taddle Tail on his classmates on the playground.

1211
01:08:50.50 --> 01:08:54.50
God dammit, we are out here in a crowd of 1,000 unpredictable Iraqis.

1212
01:08:54.50 --> 01:08:56.50
And there's a fucking booby trap somewhere I said aloud,

1213
01:08:56.50 --> 01:08:58.50
but to no one in particular.

1214
01:08:58.50 --> 01:09:04.50
So there's a, there's just, and I'm only, again,

1215
01:09:04.50 --> 01:09:06.50
I'm only reading chunks of this thing,

1216
01:09:06.50 --> 01:09:09.50
but this is a rough situation to be in.

1217
01:09:09.50 --> 01:09:11.50
How many people you guys got?

1218
01:09:11.50 --> 01:09:13.50
Like, we had 12 of that day.

1219
01:09:13.50 --> 01:09:20.50
And then, yeah, we had 12, and then they had the 1,7-Duce had an Abrams on the road.

1220
01:09:20.50 --> 01:09:24.50
And then the rain's had a little bit of security.

1221
01:09:24.50 --> 01:09:27.50
I mean, we probably, anyway, our team had 12 people.

1222
01:09:27.50 --> 01:09:30.50
How many total coalition forces?

1223
01:09:30.50 --> 01:09:31.50
Probably 40 of that.

1224
01:09:31.50 --> 01:09:33.50
And there's a thousand.

1225
01:09:33.50 --> 01:09:34.50
Yeah.

1226
01:09:34.50 --> 01:09:35.50
Something like that.

1227
01:09:35.50 --> 01:09:35.50
Yeah.

1228
01:09:35.50 --> 01:09:36.50
Something roughly.

1229
01:09:36.50 --> 01:09:39.50
I mean, you know that, that joint recruitment checkpoint of the road

1230
01:09:39.50 --> 01:09:41.50
by the bridge from the glass factory?

1231
01:09:41.50 --> 01:09:42.50
I don't know.

1232
01:09:42.50 --> 01:09:45.50
It's like, it's got to be,

1233
01:09:45.50 --> 01:09:48.50
a third, it's got to be a third of a mile or so,

1234
01:09:48.50 --> 01:09:49.50
maybe even a half a mile.

1235
01:09:49.50 --> 01:09:50.50
Or maybe it's a quarter.

1236
01:09:50.50 --> 01:09:52.50
But anyway, you know, they might have changed too.

1237
01:09:52.50 --> 01:09:54.50
Yeah, yeah, they could have took it out.

1238
01:09:54.50 --> 01:09:55.50
That's true.

1239
01:09:55.50 --> 01:09:59.50
Anyway, they were lined up down there to like, down there, to their 3D.

1240
01:09:59.50 --> 01:10:00.50
I got pictures of it.

1241
01:10:00.50 --> 01:10:01.50
I should say.

1242
01:10:01.50 --> 01:10:04.50
There's a lot of people there.

1243
01:10:04.50 --> 01:10:09.50
So, your, at this point, you're trying to locate the ID.

1244
01:10:09.50 --> 01:10:10.50
You're kind of like, you're focused on that.

1245
01:10:10.50 --> 01:10:12.50
You've got, of course, you can't just totally focus on that.

1246
01:10:12.50 --> 01:10:14.50
You've got to list other guys walking around.

1247
01:10:14.50 --> 01:10:17.50
You're asking questions.

1248
01:10:17.50 --> 01:10:21.50
And then going back to the book, I heard a strange sound to my left.

1249
01:10:21.50 --> 01:10:25.50
Followed by the report of rifles and bursts from the machine guns,

1250
01:10:25.50 --> 01:10:29.50
set atop the Abrams tank that had been positioned to a block of street.

1251
01:10:29.50 --> 01:10:31.50
I dropped to an E.M.A.G.N. to scan for targets.

1252
01:10:31.50 --> 01:10:37.50
Bang, bang, bang, crack, crack, crack, crack, the round sound and off as they hit struck their target.

1253
01:10:37.50 --> 01:10:39.50
Men began shouting in two different languages.

1254
01:10:39.50 --> 01:10:41.50
The confusion of combat sets in rapidly.

1255
01:10:41.50 --> 01:10:46.50
I rackies were running around frantically, screaming in high pitch tones and flailing about in the streets.

1256
01:10:46.50 --> 01:10:50.50
Other stood frozen as if in fear and curiosity had stiffened them.

1257
01:10:50.50 --> 01:10:54.50
Still scanning for a target that I could possibly identify and engage,

1258
01:10:54.50 --> 01:11:00.50
but becoming up with none, I was getting worried that I was missing some obvious ambush coming from the buildings to our south.

1259
01:11:00.50 --> 01:11:02.50
Then I saw it.

1260
01:11:02.50 --> 01:11:06.50
A semi-truck had crashed through our perimeter a few hundred meters away.

1261
01:11:06.50 --> 01:11:11.50
Our fellow soldiers and Marines had immediately recognized the threat and eliminated it before.

1262
01:11:11.50 --> 01:11:14.50
It could do any more damage to our position.

1263
01:11:14.50 --> 01:11:17.50
That's one hell of a v-bit I fought to myself.

1264
01:11:17.50 --> 01:11:22.50
The acute problem had been solved, I hoped for all I knew that thing might be filled with explosives.

1265
01:11:22.50 --> 01:11:26.50
But an even larger threat now loomed, a terrified mob.

1266
01:11:26.50 --> 01:11:31.50
Civilians were running around horrified shoving each other, climbing over the jersey barriers,

1267
01:11:31.50 --> 01:11:34.50
screaming, lost in the confusion of the moment.

1268
01:11:34.50 --> 01:11:40.50
It did not take long to decide that we could not allow them to get any more riotous.

1269
01:11:40.50 --> 01:11:43.50
It was time to start wrangling non-combatants.

1270
01:11:43.50 --> 01:11:47.50
Johnny was within a year shot, so I asked him what the new plan of action was.

1271
01:11:47.50 --> 01:11:50.50
He radioed the talk and briefed them on the current situation.

1272
01:11:50.50 --> 01:11:54.50
Our commanding officers verified that reinforcement troops were now in route.

1273
01:11:54.50 --> 01:12:02.50
All we could do in the time being, is keep the Iraqis contained until we had enough help to reorganize them.

1274
01:12:02.50 --> 01:12:05.50
So there's a big vehicle approaches.

1275
01:12:05.50 --> 01:12:10.50
Machine gun on the tank, the co-ax or something stops that vehicle.

1276
01:12:10.50 --> 01:12:17.50
Yeah, we had a machine gun set up in a position that kind of blocking position too.

1277
01:12:17.50 --> 01:12:21.50
So that was the end you could be hitting the engine block and disabled it.

1278
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:28.50
And it ended up turned out, it was just the Iraq, you mean the Iraq, you mean the Iraq, you mean you just drove through our constant pain of the war.

1279
01:12:28.50 --> 01:12:33.50
But you can't, I mean a situation like especially when we were told all morning that's a VBA.

1280
01:12:33.50 --> 01:12:41.50
Yeah, and by the way, that means there's constant wind, that means there's signs in Arabic that say don't pass here deadly force will be used.

1281
01:12:41.50 --> 01:12:49.50
There's several layers of that stuff, which is why I was saying earlier like you could never imagine that someone would do that.

1282
01:12:49.50 --> 01:12:58.50
And oftentimes also there, well, and in this case likely true, probably a distraction to get people distracted from what else was happening.

1283
01:12:58.50 --> 01:13:08.50
Maybe they'd have time to build a VBA, and so they just sent this guy in there to start the distraction, which is what it looks like to me.

1284
01:13:08.50 --> 01:13:14.50
Going back to the book, we started yelling at the civilians to get back in a line as Carlos translated for us.

1285
01:13:14.50 --> 01:13:19.50
A few listened, but most pretended not to hear what he was saying or just playing to afraid to move.

1286
01:13:19.50 --> 01:13:26.50
We ratchet it up our anger, little and look them dead in the eye and let them know we were still in command of this circus, but it was a little use.

1287
01:13:26.50 --> 01:13:32.50
Whether we wanted it to be or not soon became apparent that we were going to have to be more forceful.

1288
01:13:32.50 --> 01:13:37.50
Some of the men had to be physically dragged off of the tops of barriers.

1289
01:13:37.50 --> 01:13:45.50
Some had to be shoved, others conformed when they saw that we were no longer messing around still others ran away and escaped the scene altogether.

1290
01:13:48.50 --> 01:13:49.50
Fast forward a little bit.

1291
01:13:49.50 --> 01:13:57.50
Two of our new marine friends were there asking whether we wanted them to get their dogs. Roger.

1292
01:13:57.50 --> 01:13:59.50
Please do.

1293
01:13:59.50 --> 01:14:03.50
These two marines were canine handlers and by reputation damn good ones.

1294
01:14:03.50 --> 01:14:05.50
One of them was Sergeant Can.

1295
01:14:05.50 --> 01:14:08.50
He had already deployed to Iraq before.

1296
01:14:08.50 --> 01:14:16.50
This round for him had started at a small base out in western Iraq near the Syrian border, but that area lacked the action he long for.

1297
01:14:16.50 --> 01:14:20.50
So he had requested transfer to the hottest area of the fight, Ramadi.

1298
01:14:20.50 --> 01:14:36.50
He was a true badass war fighter and in my experience the military has no better tool for safely changing the minds of stubborn Iraqi men than a canine warrior at one den of a leash and a coxure marine at the other.

1299
01:14:36.50 --> 01:14:41.50
So you got dogs on station now.

1300
01:14:41.50 --> 01:14:47.50
At one point you sort of lighten your load a little bit.

1301
01:14:47.50 --> 01:14:50.50
What did you go back into the gate to do that?

1302
01:14:50.50 --> 01:14:51.50
Yeah, yeah.

1303
01:14:51.50 --> 01:14:53.50
It's to the man gate and just started to awful.

1304
01:14:53.50 --> 01:15:02.50
Because there was so many grab hands going on we were so undermaned and I started worrying about especially my smoke up here getting hit with a flat.

1305
01:15:02.50 --> 01:15:05.50
You know, I just didn't want to burn the shit on my face.

1306
01:15:05.50 --> 01:15:22.50
So I started to awful and stuff and then I chose to keep my shotgun which I still it's still weird to me that I but I didn't know like my shotgun is what I really needed in the moment for the crowd, but you know what if we had to push out and anyway I talked about that a little bit there.

1307
01:15:22.50 --> 01:15:27.50
So it was I mean if you had to push out maybe you got to go back and get your rifle around like,

1308
01:15:27.50 --> 01:15:39.50
you know, but you but you made yourself a little slicker is basically what you did so you could do more crowd control without worrying about one of these guys grabbing something.

1309
01:15:39.50 --> 01:15:42.50
There's some Iraqi policemen with you.

1310
01:15:42.50 --> 01:15:48.50
Yeah, and these guys started getting they started getting hyper aggressive.

1311
01:15:48.50 --> 01:15:51.50
That was the best one we had by the way.

1312
01:15:51.50 --> 01:16:04.50
I don't know, this one, this one that's going off here here. So this guy like basically is pointing his what point is AK at everybody, you know, he's getting ready to freaking looks like he's getting ready to start shooting people.

1313
01:16:04.50 --> 01:16:10.50
Well when I found him they had him in circled and he was in the center of circle and they were hauling back and forth.

1314
01:16:10.50 --> 01:16:11.50
I don't know what they were saying.

1315
01:16:11.50 --> 01:16:27.50
And then I same jack around that.

1316
01:16:27.50 --> 01:16:34.50
He was scared. You know, they they don't respect other Iraqis and there's a really weird customary thing.

1317
01:16:34.50 --> 01:16:42.50
I don't know if this was throughout the whole of Iraq, but for sure in Ramadi where they're really like not afraid of AKs.

1318
01:16:42.50 --> 01:16:48.50
You plot a pistol and those mofos get all kinds of like, you know, it's a attitude changer.

1319
01:16:48.50 --> 01:16:53.50
And I've always heard that maybe it was because of like hit squads and stuff like that.

1320
01:16:53.50 --> 01:16:59.50
But yeah, so if you just have like an AK point now, I'm like, man, I've been doing that to my brothers since we were five, you know.

1321
01:16:59.50 --> 01:17:07.50
I'm not even, I'm not even worried about it, you know. So he was like jacking that round in to be like, no, I'm seriously going to shoot you.

1322
01:17:07.50 --> 01:17:13.50
So then all of a sudden, hey, I heard yelled in a forwardative and powerful, new American voice.

1323
01:17:13.50 --> 01:17:18.50
We don't fucking act like that around here. That's Saddam's tactics. We don't pull that shit.

1324
01:17:18.50 --> 01:17:24.50
Lieutenant Colonel Mack had arrived and he was not pleased with the behavior of Iraqi comrade.

1325
01:17:24.50 --> 01:17:32.50
Apparently Colonel Mack had heard that things were getting out of hand and had decided to gather up his personal security detail and come see the mission through.

1326
01:17:32.50 --> 01:17:39.50
With the help of Max team, the dog handlers, we began to, and the dog handlers, we began to regain control of the crowd.

1327
01:17:39.50 --> 01:17:49.50
We separated civilians into three lines heading east and west along the large concrete wall that formed the outer border of the glass factory.

1328
01:17:49.50 --> 01:17:57.50
Fast forward a little bit the entire morning, my good friend and medic whom we affectionately called Z had been pounding me to have him relieved of his post.

1329
01:17:57.50 --> 01:18:05.50
He was manning our 50 caliber machine gun within the walls of the glass factory, which we had set up to defend us from the crowd and from potential attacks.

1330
01:18:05.50 --> 01:18:13.50
For me though, the problem at hand was a personal one. Z was, so he's like requesting, yeah, he didn't get out of there.

1331
01:18:13.50 --> 01:18:23.50
He even honoured me for an hour by then. And your basic thought was, don't come out here. You just want to put a he's the medic if something happens. You don't want him to be involved in it.

1332
01:18:23.50 --> 01:18:35.50
So you're, you basically, you're basically like, okay, just a minute, just hold on and you're basically just trying to put it off until the, yeah, I mean, I told him no for hours and he just wouldn't shut the up like,

1333
01:18:35.50 --> 01:18:44.50
I'm just giving me a second, giving me a second, giving me a second. I thought I'm trying that tactic slow roll them.

1334
01:18:44.50 --> 01:19:00.50
Fast forward a little bit. Hey, corporate McCoy get over here, Lieutenant Colonel Mac yelled at me. I'll be right back. You know what to do. I told Rick before I jogged over to the Colonel. And again, this seems a little bit like still did when I read it. Maybe you don't recognize all these characters. That's because I'm not reading the whole book. So by the book.

1335
01:19:00.50 --> 01:19:17.50
Hey McCoy, you got any dip, yes sir. Mac was a commanding but warm leader. You could not help but feel a little stronger when you talked to him. He was straight to the point. It would, and I would not use the word friendly per se, but he was certainly not the typical overbearing massively insecure,

1336
01:19:17.50 --> 01:19:31.50
or a cure, or a margin that some officers or even NCOs for that matter can be. He was a warrior. I manned you respected and admired. He went on to give me a new set of instructions that I cannot quite recall and then sent me off.

1337
01:19:31.50 --> 01:19:43.50
Each of us heading back to our positions about 50 meters apart. When I got back to Rick and student front of him with my back turn to his direction and picked up instruction, right where I had left off.

1338
01:19:43.50 --> 01:19:58.50
Then Z called me on the radio again to say he was on his way out there because he had found relief. I reached up with my left hand to key the microphone on my left shoulder and bent my neck to respond. Raj, see you out there.

1339
01:19:58.50 --> 01:20:14.50
Suddenly there was a loud bark followed by a violent growl coming from somewhere just in front of me. I peered under the brim of my helmet to figure out what was going on. Next still bent to the radio mic.

1340
01:20:14.50 --> 01:20:27.50
When I racking man in the midst of the first line by the arm and began to shake him violently, sergeant can through himself at the guy, boom, boom.

1341
01:20:27.50 --> 01:20:52.50
I was rumbled out back to back accompanied by two rapid white flashes. A burning, staying sensation shot through my entire body. It was as if I had been struck by lightning. I felt my muscles and bones contoured fiercely, almost like they had flexed in succession so swiftly that their mere compression had been enough to shatter my skeleton.

1342
01:20:52.50 --> 01:21:13.50
Then followed an unimaginable pain. It felt like every nerve and my body had been set ablaze at the same instant. Then blackness.

1343
01:21:13.50 --> 01:21:28.50
It's a pretty good memory of that. Surprisingly up into that moment I think I have a pre-solid handle and then afterwards it's a little looser for a period.

1344
01:21:28.50 --> 01:21:42.50
When Johnny and I talked about it, he had said that he thought he got to me within a minute or so, which is totally plausible given the distance.

1345
01:21:42.50 --> 01:22:00.50
My mind seemed to be quite a bit longer. After getting your head bailed around, my side call told me that the reason that that's not uncommon is for leading up into something.

1346
01:22:00.50 --> 01:22:13.50
It's called a flashbowl memory or something like this. You're brain-like imprints. Like a one moment in time. Like apparently this often happens to people in violent situations.

1347
01:22:13.50 --> 01:22:24.50
I think it's called a flashbowl memory. It's only as accurate as I can be. I'm sure there's mistakes.

1348
01:22:24.50 --> 01:22:41.50
I've got friends that got blown up and they don't really remember anything. Maybe 15-20 minutes before it happened and then just blank until they wake up in a hospital somewhere.

1349
01:22:41.50 --> 01:22:57.50
That's from that moment that's where I started the podcast when you wake up in the sand and covered in blood.

1350
01:22:57.50 --> 01:23:12.50
Going back to the book here, fast forward a little bit. You say when the blast went off, they'd thrown dozens of men including me, some tens of feet. When we had all landed, I met up at the bottom of one of the piles of dead and wounded.

1351
01:23:12.50 --> 01:23:32.50
Johnny pulled the bodies off me as he continued to shout. Corpse is lifted one by one. I believe there were three bodies on top of me. The weight lesson. I could move a little more freely. Then when one of the corpses was pulled off of me, I saw the mangled parts which had blocked the view to my own hips leave with it.

1352
01:23:32.50 --> 01:23:46.50
The first time since the initial blast my waistline was exposed, I was able to see that my hips and at least the upper portion of both of my legs were still intact. I had not been cut in half after all. Great news in the darkest of moments.

1353
01:23:46.50 --> 01:24:00.50
But I still could not see below my knees. Johnny grabbed my body and rolled me over. I realized my legs were still fully attached and fully articulated from feet to hip. The pain was extraordinary, but things were looking up.

1354
01:24:00.50 --> 01:24:10.50
My friend kept on talking to me as he patched me not my now exposed wounds. He assured me that both of my legs were still there and that they were not missing any joints.

1355
01:24:10.50 --> 01:24:21.50
Which I thought I saw with my own eyes, but his reassurance sure didn't hurt anything. He did his best to keep me calm and relaxed. I did my hardest to tough it out for him.

1356
01:24:21.50 --> 01:24:36.50
On every mission I wore no-mex gloves, which I had the fingers cut out of early on deployment. Because my right hand was so mangled to Johnny and Lyle, another soldier who had, who was helping administer first aid, fought it best just to get the bleeding stopped.

1357
01:24:36.50 --> 01:24:48.50
So they bandaged my hand right over the top of the glove. They had my right hand elevated and bandaged it up by the time I saw it, but both bandages and the glove quickly ran through with blood.

1358
01:24:48.50 --> 01:25:06.50
There was a three-inch long gash across the top of my right forearm just above my wrist. It had been opened up so wide that it revealed the bright white bones and my warm and pink muscle fibers, which twitched on either side of the wound as it bled.

1359
01:25:06.50 --> 01:25:12.50
There were approximately seven holes in that arm and eight more in my left. They were all leaking.

1360
01:25:12.50 --> 01:25:27.50
Hot thin, but looking blood, traced gashely lines down each arm from shoulder to hand. I had still yet to see what my legs look like under my uniform, but it was obvious that even though all of each leg was still attached, the situation was dire.

1361
01:25:27.50 --> 01:25:43.50
Every time I shuttered, convulsed or was burnt by someone else, I grunted him moaned in agony. Otherwise, I either gritted my teeth to get a handle on the pain or babbled in co-herently. I'm sorry Johnny, I'm trying not to be a pussy, but this shit really hurts.

1362
01:25:43.50 --> 01:25:57.50
I know it does, bro, you don't have to apologize. When Zee, our medic finally reached us, he looked over at me and said, Mac, I've got to go help a Marine. He's worse off than you are. I'll be back as soon as I can. His voice was stricken with panic.

1363
01:25:57.50 --> 01:26:10.50
I heard it, but I felt a deep sense of pride at how well my friend and teammate defeated that trepidation and did his job right. Zee stood up and hustled over a sergeant can side to begin treating treatment on him.

1364
01:26:10.50 --> 01:26:24.50
Zee was worried about my future as any close friend would be, but a basic army medical procedure had a very strict rule of progression. A medic is to start with the American who's most gravely injured.

1365
01:26:24.50 --> 01:26:39.50
You got a, one thing that's cool about this book, you got a bunch of footnotes in there where you'd kind of just add some detail and I don't know how many of them are going to read, but this one is pretty, pretty cool, pretty interesting anyways. I just want to read you right this point.

1366
01:26:39.50 --> 01:26:56.50
I'm not upsetting to watch a close friend walk away while I was currently on the brink of death, especially since he left to go help a warrior who had almost surely already passed away. But that's not how I felt it all. All I remember feeling was a deep sense of respect in the strength of character that my friend had just displayed.

1367
01:26:56.50 --> 01:27:08.50
He had been forced into an extremely uncomfortable and complex situation with nearly no time to think it over and he had demonstrated the courage to put personal loyalty's aside and do the right thing.

1368
01:27:08.50 --> 01:27:14.50
Just imagine a world we would live in if more people have that kind of fortitude.

1369
01:27:14.50 --> 01:27:26.50
Yeah, because he's like your boy. And he has to just be like, hey, I'll be back, man.

1370
01:27:26.50 --> 01:27:48.50
And my buddies that were there trying to pat, you could sell just from reading out, they're not exactly medics, if you couldn't get ants to quit bleeding. I mean they're doing the best. They're just like wrapping gauze over, you know, you got to hold all the way through my hand right here and then all the way through my nuckle and my thumb and I mean I can even move my finger.

1371
01:27:48.50 --> 01:28:00.50
So it's like this is all mangled and they're just like wrapping gauze around like we're going to work out or something. I mean they're trying, but you know what I'm saying. And then like this one appeared, you know, that was all opened up.

1372
01:28:00.50 --> 01:28:09.50
They were just like wrapping that, you know, and that was from just a ball bearing and just ripped the, you know what I mean. So they just didn't really know what they're doing.

1373
01:28:09.50 --> 01:28:15.50
And so it's not like saying could what I'm saying is not like saying couldn't see that morning first looked, you know.

1374
01:28:15.50 --> 01:28:31.50
And the one thing I can't remember if I wrote about it, but I will say is the compartment syndrome part, which maybe, which maybe you might read, but with the, with the legs sucked up probably say my life really,

1375
01:28:31.50 --> 01:28:56.50
because like creating an internal eternity on your femur. So at least my blood my legs were not bleeding as badly as they could have been. Tell us about that compartment syndrome. So when your femur's break, especially if they break in multiple places, but if any, any time they break your femur's always at risk of a compound fracture anytime that breaks because your glutes and your quads are just strong.

1376
01:28:56.50 --> 01:29:11.50
So my femur's are broken multiple places, so they just folded like, you know, almost, they just folded up anyway, and they went beside each other like this and then you're just cutting all kinds of blood vessels in there and potentially arteries and all of that.

1377
01:29:11.50 --> 01:29:32.50
So that creates some internal swelling and pressure and then you get like blood that gets locked into in between to, like the, it can't go above or below that spot. So it's like a blood that's trapped in an area, but it's almost acting like a turning to it.

1378
01:29:32.50 --> 01:29:44.50
Yeah, you basically you got lucky in the fact that you had compartments in trouble that's swelled around your arteries and shut some of that bleeding down because otherwise.

1379
01:29:44.50 --> 01:30:03.50
That this point sees back working on you. And you say, my clothing all removed, I could finally see the multitude of holes in my legs clearly see began to patch what he could, but they were even worse condition than my arms were each leg had more than 10 different holes in it.

1380
01:30:03.50 --> 01:30:15.50
Some of which were nearly two inches in diameter, most were not that big, they were the size of, they were about the size of a small marble on average, but they had gone straight through both sides of my quadriceps.

1381
01:30:15.50 --> 01:30:24.50
At this stage, the wounds were not pumping out as much blood as one might have expected. There's more like a steady leak.

1382
01:30:24.50 --> 01:30:34.50
As I lay there watching them bleed for a while thinking of myself holy shit, saving private Ryan really got it right. These wounds look exactly what they do in the movie.

1383
01:30:34.50 --> 01:30:50.50
So they are now packing you up and they're trying to get you on to a damn litter. Eventually they get you on the litter.

1384
01:30:50.50 --> 01:31:04.50
Now, each time the truck would bounce in and out of pot holes, my bones would rattle and rub together. The pain at this stage was so intense that when combined with my heavy blood loss it caused me to pass in and out of consciousness.

1385
01:31:04.50 --> 01:31:15.50
But because of the condition I was in, is doing everything in his power to keep me awake, Mac, Mac don't you go to sleep, he yelled, I'm on to responses best I could and then forced my eyes open.

1386
01:31:15.50 --> 01:31:23.50
Hit this is fun. When we finally reach the rear entrances of camp or body we ran into a whole new set of problems.

1387
01:31:23.50 --> 01:31:33.50
Our own soldiers ineptness, we rolled up only to be immediately stopped by the soldiers who ran the gate. They would not let us in because we did not have a convoy number.

1388
01:31:33.50 --> 01:31:45.50
Can't make the shit up. Yeah, Z was losing it. All those boys at that point.

1389
01:31:45.50 --> 01:31:51.50
Back and forth our driver argued with the gate guards until eventually Z standing in the bed of the truck lost his cool. We don't have a fucking convoy number.

1390
01:31:51.50 --> 01:31:56.50
I can't let you in without one. This isn't a fucking convoy you idiot. We got a wounded American here.

1391
01:31:56.50 --> 01:32:03.50
Eventually the soldiers at all can get let their better sensibilities take over. We allowed to enter our home.

1392
01:32:03.50 --> 01:32:08.50
In the the e-vac that we were using by that point, MetaVac was a five ton.

1393
01:32:08.50 --> 01:32:13.50
You know, it's like, so that's where you run you're in the back of a five ton. Yeah, that's a comfortable.

1394
01:32:13.50 --> 01:32:16.50
It's like riding on a brick with wheels.

1395
01:32:16.50 --> 01:32:27.50
It was like the litter stretched between those two benches. Yeah, it was misery. And then some sort major how this, you know, pride idea was going to.

1396
01:32:27.50 --> 01:32:31.50
You know, too many guys were rolling over. I got I never heard of a single person rolling over.

1397
01:32:31.50 --> 01:32:43.50
I remember maybe they did. But anyway, he put speed bumps all the way down. So it was like speed bumps all the way to the dam Charlie met each one of those freaking personally built for breakfast.

1398
01:32:43.50 --> 01:32:53.50
I guess sometimes I wonder if any of those guys ever read some of those late. These kind of books that got later on, you know, and just think, man, maybe that was stupid.

1399
01:32:53.50 --> 01:32:58.50
Well, what I first got to Baghdad, this is like 2003.

1400
01:32:58.50 --> 01:33:05.50
And there are all these pot holes on like the road around the base and like deep poles are kind of jacked up.

1401
01:33:05.50 --> 01:33:10.50
And then they filled in all the pot holes and then they built speed bumps.

1402
01:33:10.50 --> 01:33:17.50
I was like, well, you had it. And you filled it in. And now you build speed bumps. Come on, man.

1403
01:33:17.50 --> 01:33:32.50
Um, going back to the book, I began to pass in and out of consciousness so frequently that I was having a hard time telling the difference between reality and whatever dream world I was off to in between.

1404
01:33:32.50 --> 01:33:41.50
Once they carried me to the medical facility, they realized there was another problem. It was already filled with wounded Iraqi men and one side of Charlie Med.

1405
01:33:41.50 --> 01:33:49.50
We went in one side of Charlie Med and right out the other down the road a little way is another aid station, which belonged to our brigades engineers.

1406
01:33:49.50 --> 01:33:56.50
So we headed there once inside the first thing they did was it was only start transfusing blood in the beginning.

1407
01:33:56.50 --> 01:34:05.50
They only had lines containing a court or so a piece into each arm, but eventually had to stick an IV into my jugular and start pumping in fluid that way.

1408
01:34:05.50 --> 01:34:06.50
Damn.

1409
01:34:09.50 --> 01:34:22.50
After establishing a steady stream of flesh fresh blood into me, they fixed as many bandages as they could and rushed me out to the PLZ to board a meta-vac flight containing several other wounded people bound for balod.

1410
01:34:22.50 --> 01:34:32.50
While in route to balod the flight crew decided that because some of us lost so much blood and emergency landing in Felusia was necessary to save our lives, might included.

1411
01:34:32.50 --> 01:34:41.50
I was passing it around a consciousness again my grip of reality if you could call it that anymore with so slippery that it was like I was trying to squeeze a wet fish.

1412
01:34:41.50 --> 01:34:48.50
The hard drive tried the worst became the darkness that awaited me each time I passed out was becoming more and more welcoming.

1413
01:34:48.50 --> 01:34:56.50
I was exhausted all I wanted to do was sleep to put it into a sentence I was starting to give up.

1414
01:34:56.50 --> 01:34:59.50
What will death be like?

1415
01:34:59.50 --> 01:35:06.50
Everyone always talks about a white light near the end of a tunnel, but I am not seeing shit.

1416
01:35:06.50 --> 01:35:21.50
Yeah, and then he was cold too. It was January, I know it's from on it but it still cold. It's like 65 or something and when it's been 120 for 85 feels cold as hell.

1417
01:35:21.50 --> 01:35:25.50
And then you run out of blood so you just even colder.

1418
01:35:25.50 --> 01:35:31.50
It was at that point I was pretty close to just something health that whatever that means.

1419
01:35:31.50 --> 01:35:34.50
I don't know if you really have control that or not.

1420
01:35:34.50 --> 01:35:44.50
I think we do it some level control of it. I mean I've heard plenty of stories of people that had that will to survive and are able to stay alive.

1421
01:35:44.50 --> 01:35:54.50
You know what I actually think of that the most is here in stories from guys that were in prison of war camps and the difference between someone that lives and someone that dies.

1422
01:35:54.50 --> 01:35:58.50
This person which is like I'm going to make it and this other person said, my mom.

1423
01:35:58.50 --> 01:36:03.50
So I think there's definitely something to that.

1424
01:36:03.50 --> 01:36:05.50
Um.

1425
01:36:07.50 --> 01:36:15.50
You get here where guys are braxed and braxed and stay with us. I know it hurts but we've got a stretcher legs out again or you're going to lose them.

1426
01:36:15.50 --> 01:36:27.50
Okay, I'm on and I passed out again. Bloodstained tears running down both cheeks. I'm not sure how long I was out for and I was not fully awake but the next thing I distinctly remember was the sound of my flesh tearing under a scaple.

1427
01:36:27.50 --> 01:36:37.50
The surgeons were slicing the side of each quadricep to relieve my compartment syndrome blood and possibly spewed out of my swollen legs split wide open.

1428
01:36:37.50 --> 01:36:45.50
I will never forget the way that cutting sounded inside my head. It was reminiscent of a muddy zipper being forced open.

1429
01:36:45.50 --> 01:36:51.50
Something stick with you forever hearing your own flesh being cut apart is one of them.

1430
01:36:51.50 --> 01:37:11.50
Yeah, that's shit suck, man. It's it's need to hip on both sides like point of the knee all the way up to the point of my hip and they split and then they once they got me in that traction split and then they put in these wound vacts. It's like a big sponge.

1431
01:37:11.50 --> 01:37:21.50
And then they wrap it. So it's like a big sponge you look in thing and it's got a vacts set up across the back like poles the shit out of the sponge.

1432
01:37:21.50 --> 01:37:33.50
So I think the way it works is the sponge sucks up the moisture, whether it's either the liquid whichever liquid it is, plus the internal like water from your animal with the lid is blood and all that.

1433
01:37:33.50 --> 01:37:44.50
And then the vacuum sucks out of the sponge, I think. So they cut you open and then they slip that into the wound and it's like it's like this big you know as far as with wise.

1434
01:37:44.50 --> 01:37:49.50
And then they just put it like a plastic thing over it and just pump that.

1435
01:37:49.50 --> 01:37:55.50
Yeah, you got some pictures on your website of like your legs split open like that. It does not look.

1436
01:37:55.50 --> 01:38:00.50
It doesn't even look survivable. I mean how much they cut you open. It's freaking crazy.

1437
01:38:00.50 --> 01:38:13.50
Yeah, I mean, while my IT bands are still like, you know, your IT bands are like, suppose we won't band right and I got like two of them or four of my guests.

1438
01:38:13.50 --> 01:38:16.50
Because they can say yeah.

1439
01:38:16.50 --> 01:38:20.50
What did they like did they cut though IT band open or did they get to have just stretch open?

1440
01:38:20.50 --> 01:38:26.50
No, they had to cut through it to get to the to be able to get that wound back and there at least that's my understanding of it.

1441
01:38:26.50 --> 01:38:35.50
But you can stick your finger through it. Like you can muggle it in muscle. Yeah, it was not to me. And you were conscious during this.

1442
01:38:35.50 --> 01:38:37.50
Yeah, well, whatever you want to name me more free.

1443
01:38:37.50 --> 01:38:42.50
And anything by then I was starting now once they got me stable, then they could start hitting me with stuff.

1444
01:38:42.50 --> 01:38:48.50
But in Ramadi, they weren't going to give me anything because my blood pressure was super low and then it's didn't want to, you know, zoom me.

1445
01:38:48.50 --> 01:38:50.50
Which I think is probably good idea.

1446
01:38:50.50 --> 01:38:52.50
God be here.

1447
01:38:52.50 --> 01:38:57.50
Yeah, we'll take it whatever call got made apparently was the right one.

1448
01:38:57.50 --> 01:39:13.50
Yeah, and I, you know, I think probably what happened is I had been another thing is I've been, I don't know if Chronicles talks about this but they had, I was one of the less people getting evac because they just, it was just a wreck.

1449
01:39:13.50 --> 01:39:22.50
And they had a bunch of Iraqis that were already in Charlie Madbath time they got me there and stuff so they just screwed up the tree-odged.

1450
01:39:22.50 --> 01:39:35.50
So I think probably the call was made because I had been quite a while before they got me in there. So they're like, well, he's, you know, making it like one of them just like why risk it now. He's made it this long without it, you know.

1451
01:39:35.50 --> 01:39:43.50
And so then they, I'm sure they hit me with that in Flusha because I don't really remember Flusha the Baghdad or I mean, blood, hardly at all.

1452
01:39:43.50 --> 01:39:48.50
And all of this I'm still pretty hazy, you know.

1453
01:39:48.50 --> 01:40:01.50
Yeah, you say I was put and wrote in route to the big Air Force Base in hospital in Belad, I guess I'm still alive. I thought the question became a common three throughout the following hours and days.

1454
01:40:01.50 --> 01:40:12.50
And then like you said, you know, you're right about in the book, you can hear doctors talking, you're like partially coherent, you're tired, you're just like in and out of sleep.

1455
01:40:12.50 --> 01:40:21.50
For a while, that's pretty much your memory of Belad is just, you know, laying it out of consciousness, little bits and pieces.

1456
01:40:21.50 --> 01:40:34.50
You say I woke to loud rumbling of an airplane engine, I was being pushed across an air strip towards a C130 met a back flight headed for launch to Germany.

1457
01:40:34.50 --> 01:40:38.50
Fast forward a little bit, I had to read this part because it sounds freaking horrifying.

1458
01:40:38.50 --> 01:40:48.50
Later I woke up choking in a sheer terror, I felt like I was drowning, but how instinctively I tried to turn my head to one side to get a breath, but I couldn't because it was so tightly fast into this bed.

1459
01:40:48.50 --> 01:40:53.50
The wiggle as much as I could, gagging, hacking, trying desperately to dry, or still unsure of what was happening.

1460
01:40:53.50 --> 01:41:04.50
Left and right, I moved my head only managing a centimeter or less in either direction. I grown for help, still too tightly restrained to move, help I screamed inside my head.

1461
01:41:04.50 --> 01:41:11.50
I desperately needed to breathe. I couldn't hold my breath much longer. Yes, you can toughen up my thoughts ran wild.

1462
01:41:11.50 --> 01:41:17.50
Help, I gurgled aloud this time. It was completely unintelligible because my mouth and nose were filled with water.

1463
01:41:17.50 --> 01:41:25.50
Fear turned in anger. Inside my head I had screamed a series of idle senseless threats and cusswords.

1464
01:41:25.50 --> 01:41:37.50
Suddenly I felt a strap loosened. My head shifted to one side. As soon as I felt cleared, I coughed and hacked out all the fluids that were lodged in my throat.

1465
01:41:37.50 --> 01:41:48.50
I was still in a days, but at least I could breathe. I gasped for air and muddered. Thank you to the nurse who had just saved my life. Inside my head I was calling this flight and all the unwounded people on it.

1466
01:41:48.50 --> 01:41:52.50
Every combination of curse words I could dream up.

1467
01:41:52.50 --> 01:41:57.50
Yeah, I think I probably threw up while you were.

1468
01:41:57.50 --> 01:42:01.50
And that just woke you up as you drowned in your own vomit.

1469
01:42:01.50 --> 01:42:07.50
Yeah, probably. I thought about this later on and that's probably what happened.

1470
01:42:07.50 --> 01:42:14.50
And they strap your head to that litter. You can't move and then be on drugs and then the air.

1471
01:42:14.50 --> 01:42:17.50
And who knows how many people she's attending to?

1472
01:42:17.50 --> 01:42:21.50
I can't say she's except for the roof of the aircraft.

1473
01:42:21.50 --> 01:42:25.50
And you're all drugged up so you're barely even coherent anyway.

1474
01:42:25.50 --> 01:42:27.50
Yeah, I was scared.

1475
01:42:27.50 --> 01:42:28.50
How old are you 20 yet?

1476
01:42:28.50 --> 01:42:33.50
Yeah, 20. Yeah, 20 over there.

1477
01:42:33.50 --> 01:42:35.50
Yeah, 20. I turned 21 in back home.

1478
01:42:35.50 --> 01:42:40.50
And you had gotten married when was like, would you go home on leave? I get married?

1479
01:42:40.50 --> 01:42:41.50
Yeah, I did.

1480
01:42:41.50 --> 01:42:43.50
Yeah, I did.

1481
01:42:43.50 --> 01:42:45.50
Oh, man.

1482
01:42:45.50 --> 01:42:54.50
That's always a tough, but understandable call that soldiers can make from time to time.

1483
01:42:54.50 --> 01:42:58.50
Everybody in the whole world tells you not to do it.

1484
01:42:58.50 --> 01:43:00.50
But I don't know what I'm doing.

1485
01:43:00.50 --> 01:43:03.50
Yeah, of course.

1486
01:43:03.50 --> 01:43:14.50
I have personally given that advice to many, many young men over the years and have almost never been listened to.

1487
01:43:14.50 --> 01:43:19.50
So is it you went for, are you going home for two weeks of leave during deployment?

1488
01:43:19.50 --> 01:43:20.50
Yeah, that's me going right.

1489
01:43:20.50 --> 01:43:25.50
Yeah, check.

1490
01:43:25.50 --> 01:43:28.50
Well, it's here.

1491
01:43:28.50 --> 01:43:34.50
Later on, a surgeon came and told me that they had planned on trying to put rods in my femurs while I was in surgery there.

1492
01:43:34.50 --> 01:43:38.50
But the doctor thought it would be best to wait for the infection to clear up.

1493
01:43:38.50 --> 01:43:42.50
He explained as I lifted as he lifted the sheets and showed me my legs for the first time since I left.

1494
01:43:42.50 --> 01:43:46.50
I racked that they had instead placed external fixators on each one of them.

1495
01:43:46.50 --> 01:43:52.50
These metal cages were implanted just to get me stable enough to be flown back to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C.

1496
01:43:52.50 --> 01:43:55.50
He told me I was headed there that night.

1497
01:43:55.50 --> 01:44:06.50
So they put these freaking external fixators on your legs to try and let them heal up more before they would eventually put internal rods inside your legs.

1498
01:44:06.50 --> 01:44:09.50
They're trying to get the bacteria out.

1499
01:44:09.50 --> 01:44:16.50
There was some bacteria that they had discovered that guys were coming home with from the sand in Iraq.

1500
01:44:16.50 --> 01:44:19.50
Some moose freaking bacteria.

1501
01:44:19.50 --> 01:44:26.50
So when you get, yeah, when you get to Walter Reed, if you have that, they put a blue, like a blue label on your door or whatever.

1502
01:44:26.50 --> 01:44:35.50
So they can't put a rod in your femurs while you have an infection because it could, that you risk introducing the infection to the inside of your femur.

1503
01:44:35.50 --> 01:44:46.50
And then you're really in trouble. So they had to get that clear down and then they could get rods in and up taking like a month or something to get everything.

1504
01:44:46.50 --> 01:44:48.50
Oh, sorry, really?

1505
01:44:48.50 --> 01:44:52.50
The way that those things work is, it's like the external fixators.

1506
01:44:52.50 --> 01:44:56.50
Yeah, it's like a big cage like you're saying almost like a series of halos.

1507
01:44:56.50 --> 01:45:02.50
But then those halos have a, like rods that come out of them.

1508
01:45:02.50 --> 01:45:09.50
And those rods have screws, like drill bit screws or drill screws that wood screws on the end, looking thing more like machine heads screws.

1509
01:45:09.50 --> 01:45:13.50
And those are screwed into your bone and to keep your bones stable.

1510
01:45:13.50 --> 01:45:18.50
And then they go back out through that halo and they bolt into that halo.

1511
01:45:18.50 --> 01:45:21.50
So it's like that thing's actually screwed to your bone.

1512
01:45:21.50 --> 01:45:23.50
Yeah.

1513
01:45:23.50 --> 01:45:28.50
I had a friend of the family, little girl, she was probably nine years old and she broke a femur.

1514
01:45:28.50 --> 01:45:35.50
She had external fixator on her femur. You don't think, you don't think that seems like a good idea.

1515
01:45:35.50 --> 01:45:39.50
Like, if you're a, if you didn't know anything about medicine, which I don't,

1516
01:45:39.50 --> 01:45:47.50
that you told me, hey, what we're going to do is we're going to screw rods through the skin into the bone and have a whole contraption on the outside.

1517
01:45:47.50 --> 01:45:49.50
You'd be like, you're an idiot.

1518
01:45:49.50 --> 01:45:50.50
Yeah.

1519
01:45:50.50 --> 01:45:51.50
Just make any sense.

1520
01:45:51.50 --> 01:45:52.50
That's true.

1521
01:45:52.50 --> 01:45:54.50
It's crazy. It's a crazy idea.

1522
01:45:54.50 --> 01:46:00.50
This is, it'd be infected. Yeah.

1523
01:46:00.50 --> 01:46:02.50
That's freaking crazy.

1524
01:46:02.50 --> 01:46:06.50
This is, you go into talking about little bit like, what's going through your head at this point.

1525
01:46:06.50 --> 01:46:07.50
I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

1526
01:46:07.50 --> 01:46:12.50
This feeling of helplessness and confusion lasted in varying degrees for days, if not weeks.

1527
01:46:12.50 --> 01:46:20.50
During this period, I had surgery nearly every morning to clean and irrigate my wounds and change the bandage that swath my body.

1528
01:46:20.50 --> 01:46:33.50
What I, from what I understand, the doctors had to put me under for these daily hygiene sessions, because this year, number of open wounds and their depth made scrubbing too intrusive and time consuming to do all I was awake.

1529
01:46:33.50 --> 01:46:37.50
I had a dozen or more wound channels, which were through and through,

1530
01:46:37.50 --> 01:46:44.50
as it turned used to describe a wound that starts on one side of the body and passes through its other side, exiting entirely.

1531
01:46:44.50 --> 01:47:02.50
Usually on a limb, I also, usually on a limb. I also had dozens more wounds, conspired projectiles, which had penetrated my flesh, but it stopped in something more dense, like bone or thick muscle.

1532
01:47:02.50 --> 01:47:14.50
We think this, this, this, as vast was just like filled with ball bearings or something, and that's where you got shredded with man on pack and like eight or ten of them still.

1533
01:47:14.50 --> 01:47:17.50
How bigger they are? Are they all the same size?

1534
01:47:17.50 --> 01:47:21.50
Yeah. So it's like a uniformed kind of professionally built as vast.

1535
01:47:21.50 --> 01:47:35.50
Well, so we found some before where they were just filling up water bottles with wheel bearings, and then just taping those, that those water balls to the front of the explosive.

1536
01:47:35.50 --> 01:47:40.50
So I guess it's like professional train by the Iranians, I think probably.

1537
01:47:40.50 --> 01:47:45.50
Yeah, I got one in my ass that really messes with me when I'm riding horses.

1538
01:47:45.50 --> 01:47:52.50
Like try to get them to cut it out, but it's like too deep, I guess.

1539
01:47:55.50 --> 01:48:04.50
You say this, I spent the next few weeks in the same bed lying around and thinking about what my new life was going to be when, if I got out of the hospital.

1540
01:48:04.50 --> 01:48:11.50
When I was not caught up daydreaming about what my long-term recovery was going to look like, my mind was on my brother's back in Ramadi.

1541
01:48:11.50 --> 01:48:21.50
I knew the morale crushing war that they were living every day, and I had begun to feel an enormous amount of guilt at the thought of them facing those trials without me.

1542
01:48:21.50 --> 01:48:29.50
The thought was only made worse when I considered that they were doing it while I lay safely in a bed back in the States.

1543
01:48:29.50 --> 01:48:37.50
I felt grief as I think anyone would for the memories of lives lost and my role actively are passively in their deaths.

1544
01:48:37.50 --> 01:48:41.50
I also felt guilty for being the one being one of the people who survived.

1545
01:48:41.50 --> 01:48:46.50
I could have, should have, done more, I often fought.

1546
01:48:46.50 --> 01:48:53.50
By this point, the story of my mind had cleared through to recall the scene that got glass factory in detail.

1547
01:48:53.50 --> 01:48:58.50
I remembered seeing Sergeant Can and Bruno confronting the suicide bomber.

1548
01:48:58.50 --> 01:49:03.50
I remembered Z telling me that he had to go check on the Marine who is injured worse than I was.

1549
01:49:03.50 --> 01:49:14.50
I remembered almost everything from that morning, including the courageous action Bruno and Sergeant Can and Taken, yet somehow ridiculously and unfairly disargent cans heroic memory.

1550
01:49:14.50 --> 01:49:18.50
I had saddled myself with the guilt of his death.

1551
01:49:18.50 --> 01:49:25.50
It was not in any way my fault that he had chosen to give his life trying to protect the Marines and soldiers around him, but that was,

1552
01:49:25.50 --> 01:49:32.50
but that is much easier to write now with the rationale of hindsight than it was to convince myself of it in the hospital bed.

1553
01:49:32.50 --> 01:49:48.50
That's like the, the, the, the, the interview all these wounded soldiers, you know, and they all said,

1554
01:49:48.50 --> 01:49:57.50
I just want to get back to my unit, just want to get back to my unit, just want to get back to my unit.

1555
01:49:57.50 --> 01:50:04.50
Did, as you, so as time went on your memory of what happened to become more clear?

1556
01:50:04.50 --> 01:50:17.50
As far as the suicide bombing, I don't think, not really, it's hard, it's really hard to know because I, I got into psychology for a minute,

1557
01:50:17.50 --> 01:50:24.50
and now I know that your, your brain often like rewrite stories back or backfills, you know?

1558
01:50:24.50 --> 01:50:33.50
So I, I don't know. It's like, it's one of those questions, it seems really easy to answer, but if you're, you know, if you're being honest with yourself,

1559
01:50:33.50 --> 01:50:39.50
by the way, the human brain works, you really, it's really not the easy of a question to answer, you know, because you do backfill.

1560
01:50:39.50 --> 01:50:49.50
Do you backfill with memories that are subconscious there? You backfill with like sort of what you assemble from what you can kind of put together logically as to what happened.

1561
01:50:49.50 --> 01:50:56.50
Yeah, it could be that, and then also talking to your friends and hearing their version of stuff over time.

1562
01:50:56.50 --> 01:51:01.50
And then maybe your brain just fills in gaps, and I got to, I don't really know.

1563
01:51:01.50 --> 01:51:10.50
No, that's, that I actually do, I did a podcast about that, the way you're, the way you can hear part of a story and part of a story and your mind will fill in the gaps.

1564
01:51:10.50 --> 01:51:17.50
It will fill in the gaps with things, the, it's kind of just figure it out, then take the best guess, and then you'll kind of, you can very easily believe,

1565
01:51:17.50 --> 01:51:19.50
oh, this is what happened, this is what I saw.

1566
01:51:19.50 --> 01:51:24.50
Yeah, and you know, I can't say that, and I think it was, there's no way from it, no.

1567
01:51:24.50 --> 01:51:28.50
But I feel like, I don't, I don't know, that it really ever changed.

1568
01:51:28.50 --> 01:51:37.50
I know that, you know, I talked to Johnny before we ever put this out and he's like, yeah, man, I see, I remember, you know,

1569
01:51:37.50 --> 01:51:47.50
you know, sans this or that detail. The one detail I know that I absolutely did, Lewis, was a friend of mine Casey was out there, and I don't even remember him being there.

1570
01:51:47.50 --> 01:51:53.50
We were just driving to Texas to do a long range course the other day. Well, a couple months ago, and he was like, do I was there?

1571
01:51:53.50 --> 01:51:57.50
He was like, well, I knew he was there later. He was like, no, man, I got to you quick.

1572
01:51:57.50 --> 01:52:02.50
He's like, he's like, I was to you in like minutes, you know, I'm not even remember any of that.

1573
01:52:02.50 --> 01:52:14.50
So I know there's gotta be problems with my memory. Oh, yeah. Well, it's also everybody's memory, you know, there's everybody's memories different from witnessing the same things.

1574
01:52:14.50 --> 01:52:21.50
I know of, you know, life and I have memories of things that we did where he literally remember something, and I literally remember something else.

1575
01:52:21.50 --> 01:52:29.50
And we're both there and our viewpoint, and there's no reason, it's not like there's no reason we should remember different things, but we just do.

1576
01:52:29.50 --> 01:52:34.50
Yeah. People just have different perspective of what's going on, and then locks into their memory.

1577
01:52:34.50 --> 01:52:39.50
Yeah. And then you can only store so much shit and true.

1578
01:52:39.50 --> 01:52:42.50
Yeah, freaking hard drive gets filled up.

1579
01:52:42.50 --> 01:52:48.50
Yeah. So if you do a whole bunch of dump shit when you're young, man, we're going to be, you're going to suck it like this stage of your life.

1580
01:52:48.50 --> 01:52:50.50
You're going to lose all the good stuff.

1581
01:52:50.50 --> 01:53:03.50
Fast forward a little bit. You got surgeries, you got doctors, you got psychologists, physical therapists, just lots of things going on.

1582
01:53:03.50 --> 01:53:09.50
And again, I'm fast forward and through it, not because it's not a really interesting read.

1583
01:53:09.50 --> 01:53:19.50
Because there's all kinds of, I was learning all kinds of things, and, and, you know, the story itself is just, it's an awesome, I hate to see if you could hear the word awesome.

1584
01:53:19.50 --> 01:53:24.50
It, I don't know, one of the words to use. It's a very well told story.

1585
01:53:24.50 --> 01:53:31.50
So get the book. I'm going to fast forward a little bit to where you say these new training aids, you're doing this physical therapy.

1586
01:53:31.50 --> 01:53:39.50
These new training aids were useful, and they did help me pass the time, but at this stage of my recovery, the only lofty goal I had left look for to is getting,

1587
01:53:39.50 --> 01:53:43.50
getting the external fixators removed and moving into a wheelchair.

1588
01:53:43.50 --> 01:53:48.50
Not more than a month before I had been a young man, a warrior in his prime.

1589
01:53:48.50 --> 01:53:56.50
Now I lay in bed, doing my level best to avoid sleep, and my grandest physical aspirations were to have the cages,

1590
01:53:56.50 --> 01:54:01.50
remove from my legs, and be fitted for a wheelchair.

1591
01:54:01.50 --> 01:54:06.50
20 years old.

1592
01:54:06.50 --> 01:54:13.50
Yeah, and because my hand was messed up, I only had one hand that went in my left.

1593
01:54:13.50 --> 01:54:20.50
Humors was broken, so I had plastic. They didn't cast it because they wanted to leave me with a limb that was still functional.

1594
01:54:20.50 --> 01:54:29.50
So I had a spiral fracture here, and they just put a plastic, almost like, I almost like the stuff motocross guys where, you know,

1595
01:54:29.50 --> 01:54:34.50
I was like, I didn't really, I don't know that really didn't anything, but other than like remind you your shit was broken.

1596
01:54:34.50 --> 01:54:36.50
I got like, I don't know what it was doing.

1597
01:54:36.50 --> 01:54:44.50
But so the, what was occupational OT, occupational therapy, they bring like these tools,

1598
01:54:44.50 --> 01:54:50.50
and you learn how to like pull a sock over this kind of conical shaped thing,

1599
01:54:50.50 --> 01:54:54.50
and it's got a couple of strings hooked to it, and throw that shit at your foot,

1600
01:54:54.50 --> 01:55:00.50
and so you can pull like your own sock on and get started, or yeah, they'd bring like this,

1601
01:55:00.50 --> 01:55:07.50
kind of a certain conical shape deal with buttons on it, and zippers, and try to learn how to manipulate stuff with one hand.

1602
01:55:07.50 --> 01:55:13.50
And I don't know if they were doing that to prep me, because they weren't sure how much my hand would ever work again,

1603
01:55:13.50 --> 01:55:18.50
and that, I mean, that could honestly be possible, but I don't know if, so I'm saying, I don't know if it's routine,

1604
01:55:18.50 --> 01:55:25.50
I don't know if everybody does this, but they brought me all these aids that I was, you know, trying to learn how to do shit with one hand, which,

1605
01:55:25.50 --> 01:55:31.50
anyway, that was like I was passing my time, that in watching like dukes of hazard, on dovety,

1606
01:55:31.50 --> 01:55:36.50
thing, and sign filled and shit. By the time you were aware of what was going on,

1607
01:55:36.50 --> 01:55:40.50
were you, was it seem like pretty solid that you were going to keep both your legs?

1608
01:55:40.50 --> 01:55:44.50
Oh yeah, it did, for sure, by that point, yeah.

1609
01:55:44.50 --> 01:55:53.50
Going back to the book here, fast forward a little bit, I laid in bed for the next few days,

1610
01:55:53.50 --> 01:56:00.50
a little more beaten down than I was before. I raised the sheets now and then with my left arm, my only limb, that sort of function,

1611
01:56:00.50 --> 01:56:05.50
and wondered whether this was finally going to be the thing that took my legs for me.

1612
01:56:05.50 --> 01:56:12.50
I was physically tough and was tolerating pain, but the roller coaster of emotions, and the all-around uncertainties surrounding my life

1613
01:56:12.50 --> 01:56:18.50
was starting to get me down. I was nearing that breaking point again. I spent most of my time just watching the yellow,

1614
01:56:18.50 --> 01:56:24.50
green, plus ooze out of my thighs. They look like Swiss cheese that had been aged way too long,

1615
01:56:24.50 --> 01:56:29.50
and the smell radiated throughout the room. This was a gnarly infection that you had.

1616
01:56:29.50 --> 01:56:35.50
Yeah, again, green. That was like my third infection too.

1617
01:56:35.50 --> 01:56:41.50
And I don't know if you, I'm not trying to throw Walter read under the bus, but right around that time was one scene,

1618
01:56:41.50 --> 01:56:50.50
and then that, or maybe it was right after that, when CNN did that, I can expose that time, do.

1619
01:56:50.50 --> 01:56:57.50
And I remember some perhaps unsanitary stuff, but Walter was like loaded with people with that point.

1620
01:56:57.50 --> 01:57:03.50
They were a crap old dude there, so I don't want to, you know, I'm not trying to throw anybody under the bus.

1621
01:57:03.50 --> 01:57:10.50
There was definitely some stuff that was not being, like there's too much infection going around to not be having some procedure.

1622
01:57:10.50 --> 01:57:13.50
Something's being screwed up here. Yeah.

1623
01:57:13.50 --> 01:57:25.50
So, but they reschedule the surgery. They get done. They take off the fixators, and then they put rods inside your femurs,

1624
01:57:25.50 --> 01:57:31.50
remove the freaking spongy vacuum machine things.

1625
01:57:31.50 --> 01:57:44.50
Yeah. Let the wounds close. Hundreds of stitches, you say, staples. And you had been in bed at this point that you so long were you had a bed source, like gnarly bed source.

1626
01:57:44.50 --> 01:57:47.50
Yeah, there's still scarred.

1627
01:57:47.50 --> 01:57:48.50
Yeah.

1628
01:57:48.50 --> 01:57:57.50
And when they put those rods in, they, because of the way the brakes were on my right leg, I think they called it a retrograde nail,

1629
01:57:57.50 --> 01:58:03.50
but they went, they flipped your kneecap over and come up through the bottom, and then it screws up into your hip.

1630
01:58:03.50 --> 01:58:08.50
But on my left leg, they put a rod, excuse me, and my left hip as well.

1631
01:58:08.50 --> 01:58:14.50
So they put that rod through the hip into the femoral head, and then it has like an eyelet at the top,

1632
01:58:14.50 --> 01:58:18.50
and then they put the other rod through that eyelet, so it's tied together.

1633
01:58:18.50 --> 01:58:22.50
And then that one screws down into your, the head of your femur on the bottom head.

1634
01:58:22.50 --> 01:58:24.50
I don't know what the proper, I felt an enemy.

1635
01:58:24.50 --> 01:58:33.50
But it down here, so they went both directions, so it was kind of like, like up my hips, and my right knee sucks.

1636
01:58:33.50 --> 01:58:36.50
I get this point, you know, so they gave you one of each.

1637
01:58:36.50 --> 01:58:39.50
Yeah, one they went from the bottom, one they went from the top down.

1638
01:58:39.50 --> 01:58:40.50
Yeah.

1639
01:58:40.50 --> 01:58:40.50
Yeah.

1640
01:58:40.50 --> 01:58:44.50
But they didn't put a rod in my right hip, because it wasn't broke as bad.

1641
01:58:48.50 --> 01:58:53.50
At one point, your uncle, Justin, comes to visit you.

1642
01:58:53.50 --> 01:58:56.50
And you call him Juddy.

1643
01:58:56.50 --> 01:58:58.50
That's his nickname.

1644
01:58:58.50 --> 01:59:03.50
He says to you, one of the days he was there, he discovered some information that had been kept from me.

1645
01:59:03.50 --> 01:59:05.50
Hey, bro, I need to tell you something.

1646
01:59:05.50 --> 01:59:07.50
Okay, I said, expecting the worst.

1647
01:59:07.50 --> 01:59:09.50
Colonel Mac died.

1648
01:59:09.50 --> 01:59:15.50
No, we wanted to tell you because they were not sure how you were, whether you were healthy enough to hear that.

1649
01:59:15.50 --> 01:59:16.50
How?

1650
01:59:16.50 --> 01:59:21.50
He was killed by Shrapnel from the suicide bomber that hit you.

1651
01:59:21.50 --> 01:59:23.50
Oh, thanks for telling me.

1652
01:59:23.50 --> 01:59:25.50
I said, slightly in shock.

1653
01:59:25.50 --> 01:59:27.50
It was particularly devastating news.

1654
01:59:27.50 --> 01:59:32.50
I already knew that Sergeant Canada passed away, but Colonel Mac seemed impossible.

1655
01:59:32.50 --> 01:59:37.50
But he was way too far away to have been struck by any significant amount of Shrapnel I thought.

1656
01:59:37.50 --> 01:59:42.50
As it happened, he had been quite a ways away, and he had only been hit by a few pieces of Shrapnel.

1657
01:59:42.50 --> 01:59:48.50
But those ball bearings had hit him in the back of the head, killing him virtually instantly.

1658
01:59:48.50 --> 01:59:50.50
Survival in wars around to my have learned.

1659
01:59:50.50 --> 01:59:52.50
Yeah.

1660
01:59:52.50 --> 01:59:54.50
Yeah, that was what I was like.

1661
01:59:54.50 --> 01:59:56.50
He was seen like long, always away.

1662
01:59:56.50 --> 01:59:58.50
Like 70 yards or 50.

1663
01:59:58.50 --> 02:00:04.50
I mean, it seemed like a long, long way, it's long, long, long, long.

1664
02:00:04.50 --> 02:00:08.50
Actually, well, it's a scene far.

1665
02:00:08.50 --> 02:00:10.50
And you know, I was a 20 year old kid, 20 year old kid.

1666
02:00:10.50 --> 02:00:14.50
20 year old kid really had to lose, you know, he had three kids at home.

1667
02:00:14.50 --> 02:00:18.50
Probably like the age I am now, it's probably how old he was then.

1668
02:00:18.50 --> 02:00:23.50
I think back at stuff like that, and I don't know if I'd have that kind of sand at this age.

1669
02:00:23.50 --> 02:00:28.50
You know, with all that to put that much on the line, especially when, you know, you're a light Colonel.

1670
02:00:28.50 --> 02:00:34.50
You're a lieutenant Colonel out there, with a bunch of E-4s, E-5s, and the highest ring of the year as E-6.

1671
02:00:34.50 --> 02:00:36.50
I mean, that's quite a gap.

1672
02:00:36.50 --> 02:00:37.50
Yeah.

1673
02:00:37.50 --> 02:00:39.50
That was just a...

1674
02:00:39.50 --> 02:00:43.50
Yeah, no, even when I got there, because I got there, this was in January.

1675
02:00:43.50 --> 02:00:50.50
I got there in April, and people talked about him, like totally revered him as a leader,

1676
02:00:50.50 --> 02:00:55.50
and what he was doing, and what he was making work, and effort that he was putting forth.

1677
02:00:55.50 --> 02:01:01.50
I mean, just was everybody revered the guy.

1678
02:01:01.50 --> 02:01:07.50
You say, learning of the death of Colonel Mack was another psychological set back in time,

1679
02:01:07.50 --> 02:01:09.50
right with them.

1680
02:01:09.50 --> 02:01:13.50
My belt with survivors' guilt was getting more aggressive by the day.

1681
02:01:13.50 --> 02:01:18.50
I was still having serious trouble sleeping, and my overall emotional well being wall awake was so fragile

1682
02:01:18.50 --> 02:01:22.50
that even I was beginning to recognize it.

1683
02:01:22.50 --> 02:01:27.50
This was roughly the time I began to use physical recovery as a distraction for mental anguish.

1684
02:01:27.50 --> 02:01:30.50
I have often heard the phrase, fake it till you make it.

1685
02:01:30.50 --> 02:01:34.50
I'm not exactly sure where it originated, but I was about to take my turn at the strategy,

1686
02:01:34.50 --> 02:01:39.50
and would do so for years to come, flagantly unsuccessfully.

1687
02:01:39.50 --> 02:01:51.50
Yeah, I think that fake it to the make it's bullshit.

1688
02:01:51.50 --> 02:01:53.50
It's completely bullshit, man.

1689
02:01:53.50 --> 02:01:56.50
You've got to fix your foundation.

1690
02:01:56.50 --> 02:01:59.50
That's the problem. You can't just fix it.

1691
02:01:59.50 --> 02:02:02.50
You've got to go all the way to the root and start working there.

1692
02:02:02.50 --> 02:02:09.50
Yeah, I think when someone's talking about going to do some jobs and where they think they can fake it to you making.

1693
02:02:09.50 --> 02:02:10.50
It's the same thing.

1694
02:02:10.50 --> 02:02:12.50
I said, I wrote about this in the leaders from the strategy tactics.

1695
02:02:12.50 --> 02:02:17.50
If you don't know something and you're trying to fake it, everybody can see it.

1696
02:02:17.50 --> 02:02:20.50
Like even from a leadership perspective, it doesn't work.

1697
02:02:20.50 --> 02:02:26.50
But then when you start trying to put together your psychological well-being by faking it,

1698
02:02:26.50 --> 02:02:28.50
it's not going to work out good.

1699
02:02:28.50 --> 02:02:36.50
The physical therapy, you got this guy you're working with named Solomon.

1700
02:02:36.50 --> 02:02:38.50
I'm fast forward.

1701
02:02:38.50 --> 02:02:42.50
Now you're starting to heal up a little bit.

1702
02:02:42.50 --> 02:02:45.50
Hey, man, when do I get to walk down those bars?

1703
02:02:45.50 --> 02:02:49.50
My remark was said purely ingest because I'd already been told several times it would be 18 months.

1704
02:02:49.50 --> 02:02:52.50
If ever before I was going to be able to walk again,

1705
02:02:52.50 --> 02:02:54.50
you're going to use him right now.

1706
02:02:54.50 --> 02:02:56.50
He said, obviously seeing through my lame bravado.

1707
02:02:56.50 --> 02:02:58.50
I can't walk, Solomon.

1708
02:02:58.50 --> 02:03:00.50
I said, coldly.

1709
02:03:00.50 --> 02:03:01.50
Yes, you can.

1710
02:03:01.50 --> 02:03:02.50
I'm going to help you.

1711
02:03:02.50 --> 02:03:06.50
I was starting to get irritated at him because I knew I could not walk.

1712
02:03:06.50 --> 02:03:08.50
I can't even stand for hell's sake.

1713
02:03:08.50 --> 02:03:10.50
I was frustrated and embarrassed by the whole situation.

1714
02:03:10.50 --> 02:03:12.50
I was frustrated because I thought that this guy,

1715
02:03:12.50 --> 02:03:16.50
I liked it admired as soon as I was capable of more than I actually was.

1716
02:03:16.50 --> 02:03:18.50
And I was about to let him down.

1717
02:03:18.50 --> 02:03:20.50
Does he not know how badly injured I am?

1718
02:03:20.50 --> 02:03:21.50
I wondered.

1719
02:03:21.50 --> 02:03:24.50
I was embarrassed that I couldn't dress myself.

1720
02:03:24.50 --> 02:03:29.50
And embarrassed that even if I could have, I could not wear clothes that were not several sizes too big,

1721
02:03:29.50 --> 02:03:32.50
because they had to fit over my cast, some braces.

1722
02:03:32.50 --> 02:03:36.50
I was embarrassed by the fact that I could not do up a button on my own underwear,

1723
02:03:36.50 --> 02:03:39.50
or use the bathroom without help throughout the entire process.

1724
02:03:39.50 --> 02:03:43.50
I was literally unable to wipe my own ass as they say.

1725
02:03:43.50 --> 02:03:46.50
Little more than a month before this moment,

1726
02:03:46.50 --> 02:03:51.50
I had been a roughly six foot tall, 190-pound warrior in the prime of his life,

1727
02:03:51.50 --> 02:03:54.50
proud and full of all the arrogance of youth.

1728
02:03:54.50 --> 02:03:58.50
But there I was a few months later, sitting before a man who wanted to help me,

1729
02:03:58.50 --> 02:04:03.50
deeply wanted to help me, but I just physically could not do what he was asking.

1730
02:04:03.50 --> 02:04:08.50
Then there was the fear, fear that if by some miracle of the imagination,

1731
02:04:08.50 --> 02:04:11.50
I was able to stand up and try to walk, I might fall.

1732
02:04:11.50 --> 02:04:15.50
And if I fell, I would surely lose all the independence that I had fought so hard to achieve.

1733
02:04:15.50 --> 02:04:21.50
They felt like an exercising futility to even speculate about what it would be like to walk again already.

1734
02:04:21.50 --> 02:04:26.50
Then saw loosened the braces on my chair, bent down in front of me and said,

1735
02:04:26.50 --> 02:04:28.50
are you ready?

1736
02:04:30.50 --> 02:04:34.50
I reached out to what I could of my arms on his shoulders,

1737
02:04:34.50 --> 02:04:36.50
and lifted, and he lifted me out of the chair.

1738
02:04:36.50 --> 02:04:40.50
My heart races as I stood up for the first time, a feeling of anxiety, fear, and triumph washed over me,

1739
02:04:40.50 --> 02:04:43.50
though they were hardly supporting any bodyweight.

1740
02:04:43.50 --> 02:04:46.50
I could let legs shivered beneath me, then we started walking.

1741
02:04:46.50 --> 02:04:52.50
We only covered a few feet distance, but I could hardly contain my joy as saw half drag me over to those parallel bars.

1742
02:04:52.50 --> 02:04:56.50
The instant the cold stainless steel touched the fingertips of my left hand,

1743
02:04:56.50 --> 02:04:59.50
and invigorating dose of adrenaline shot through my body.

1744
02:04:59.50 --> 02:05:03.50
Even though Solomon was bearing most of my weight, I had to overcome an obstacle

1745
02:05:03.50 --> 02:05:05.50
at not at all anticipated.

1746
02:05:05.50 --> 02:05:10.50
I don't know if it was because of my brain injury, or just because it had been so long since I had last walk,

1747
02:05:10.50 --> 02:05:14.50
but I couldn't make my muscles move my legs like they were supposed to.

1748
02:05:14.50 --> 02:05:16.50
I knew how walking was supposed to be done.

1749
02:05:16.50 --> 02:05:21.50
You just lift up and step out in front of your lead foot, then repeat the on the other side.

1750
02:05:21.50 --> 02:05:25.50
I could have drawn your picture or described what walking was supposed to look like.

1751
02:05:25.50 --> 02:05:29.50
I knew how to do it, but I didn't know how to make me do it.

1752
02:05:29.50 --> 02:05:34.50
Each confusing attempt at the process and intense burst of pain to my brain,

1753
02:05:34.50 --> 02:05:39.50
that I was quite ready for, but the torment mixed with the excitement of a

1754
02:05:39.50 --> 02:05:44.50
discovery, kept releasing more of that ever intoxicating adrenaline.

1755
02:05:44.50 --> 02:05:48.50
That's got to be freaking weird when you...

1756
02:05:48.50 --> 02:05:51.50
You're body doesn't know what to do.

1757
02:05:51.50 --> 02:05:53.50
It was weird.

1758
02:05:53.50 --> 02:05:57.50
I still don't know how to describe how that felt.

1759
02:05:57.50 --> 02:06:04.50
You have a guy like Solomon there who I still do this day,

1760
02:06:04.50 --> 02:06:09.50
he was a really freaking neat guy, and I'm sure he's still alive,

1761
02:06:09.50 --> 02:06:14.50
but out of my life, because I think I'm not still alive in that hospital.

1762
02:06:14.50 --> 02:06:18.50
You got a guy like that with you that you really care for or

1763
02:06:18.50 --> 02:06:22.50
respect or whatever you want to do as you can,

1764
02:06:22.50 --> 02:06:25.50
and your body's just like not working.

1765
02:06:25.50 --> 02:06:31.50
It's almost like when you put a limb to sleep sitting on something,

1766
02:06:31.50 --> 02:06:35.50
you do it bad, not just kind of a little bit of sleep,

1767
02:06:35.50 --> 02:06:39.50
but fall down, kind of asleep.

1768
02:06:39.50 --> 02:06:41.50
Yeah, I've done that before, it's like I'm going to fall down.

1769
02:06:41.50 --> 02:06:43.50
Exactly, that's kind of how it was.

1770
02:06:43.50 --> 02:06:46.50
I knew it was supposed to work, I just could feel...

1771
02:06:46.50 --> 02:06:49.50
That's the best I can describe, it was something like that.

1772
02:06:49.50 --> 02:06:52.50
The muscles are not firing properly,

1773
02:06:52.50 --> 02:06:58.50
and then my right quad at a real good hole through it,

1774
02:06:58.50 --> 02:07:03.50
and that one, even my physical therapist that I got later on

1775
02:07:03.50 --> 02:07:07.50
is a civilian was not quite sure if that femoral or Xemia,

1776
02:07:07.50 --> 02:07:11.50
which had as that, anyway, if the actual head of that part of the quad

1777
02:07:11.50 --> 02:07:13.50
would ever fire again, because it was just not,

1778
02:07:13.50 --> 02:07:16.50
like the muscles were not going around the way they should have,

1779
02:07:16.50 --> 02:07:19.50
that it does kind of now, but so there could have been like

1780
02:07:19.50 --> 02:07:22.50
some muscular damage involved, I mean there was muscular damage involved,

1781
02:07:22.50 --> 02:07:24.50
but that could have been part of it too.

1782
02:07:24.50 --> 02:07:28.50
Wow, freaking crazy.

1783
02:07:28.50 --> 02:07:35.50
It's hard, and it's not like you're making progress,

1784
02:07:35.50 --> 02:07:40.50
but the progress is so slow that you still feel like you don't even know

1785
02:07:40.50 --> 02:07:43.50
how much you're going to be able to heal.

1786
02:07:43.50 --> 02:07:46.50
At one point, you're talking to your cousin,

1787
02:07:46.50 --> 02:07:49.50
Juddie again, and you say,

1788
02:07:49.50 --> 02:07:51.50
you say, Juddie, I might never walk again,

1789
02:07:51.50 --> 02:07:53.50
and if I do, I'll probably be assisted in some way.

1790
02:07:53.50 --> 02:07:56.50
I don't want to push around a walker for the rest of my life.

1791
02:07:56.50 --> 02:07:59.50
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

1792
02:07:59.50 --> 02:08:02.50
I'll never feel that icy mountain water roll past my waiters,

1793
02:08:02.50 --> 02:08:05.50
as I cast flies at fall browns.

1794
02:08:05.50 --> 02:08:08.50
I'll only have memories of sliding into a saddle

1795
02:08:08.50 --> 02:08:10.50
on a crisp October morning.

1796
02:08:10.50 --> 02:08:12.50
When at dawn, you can see your breath and by noon,

1797
02:08:12.50 --> 02:08:15.50
you're, you've swept through your hat band.

1798
02:08:15.50 --> 02:08:19.50
I've done my last bow hunt, no more dirt bikes or bull rides.

1799
02:08:19.50 --> 02:08:22.50
I basically just started up my twilight years

1800
02:08:22.50 --> 02:08:24.50
and my early 20s.

1801
02:08:24.50 --> 02:08:28.50
I'm in a fucking nursing home for soldiers right now,

1802
02:08:28.50 --> 02:08:31.50
and I may always be.

1803
02:08:31.50 --> 02:08:33.50
I was being a negative, whiny child.

1804
02:08:33.50 --> 02:08:35.50
There was no doubt about it.

1805
02:08:35.50 --> 02:08:38.50
But I was trying to explain to him everything that made me,

1806
02:08:38.50 --> 02:08:40.50
me, was gone.

1807
02:08:40.50 --> 02:08:42.50
Those were not just activities that I like to do.

1808
02:08:42.50 --> 02:08:43.50
That was my identity.

1809
02:08:43.50 --> 02:08:47.50
I hunted, fished, cowboyed, and soldiered.

1810
02:08:47.50 --> 02:08:49.50
Those were my essence.

1811
02:08:49.50 --> 02:08:52.50
If I was too broken to do those things that distinguished me,

1812
02:08:52.50 --> 02:08:55.50
then I was too broken to live as far as I was concerned.

1813
02:09:01.50 --> 02:09:02.50
Yeah.

1814
02:09:02.50 --> 02:09:04.50
That's everything you like to do.

1815
02:09:04.50 --> 02:09:06.50
Yeah, I think they do.

1816
02:09:06.50 --> 02:09:07.50
Never do it again.

1817
02:09:07.50 --> 02:09:10.50
Yeah, I think a lot of guys go through that.

1818
02:09:10.50 --> 02:09:14.50
And even I think some, you like you look at guys

1819
02:09:14.50 --> 02:09:16.50
when they're getting ready retire from them,

1820
02:09:16.50 --> 02:09:19.50
you know, I feel like everything's gone.

1821
02:09:19.50 --> 02:09:21.50
I mean, maybe not in the same circumstances.

1822
02:09:21.50 --> 02:09:24.50
There are some guys who are in similar circumstances with their brains.

1823
02:09:24.50 --> 02:09:27.50
But, you know, maybe not exactly the same kind of circumstance,

1824
02:09:27.50 --> 02:09:30.50
but they're going through a similar like period.

1825
02:09:30.50 --> 02:09:31.50
Yeah.

1826
02:09:31.50 --> 02:09:34.50
Like everything that they are in some sense being taken away from them

1827
02:09:34.50 --> 02:09:36.50
because father times on the feet, right?

1828
02:09:36.50 --> 02:09:39.50
And that's a similar, you know, I think it's similar.

1829
02:09:39.50 --> 02:09:43.50
So I'm definitely not alone in having experienced these sorts of feelings.

1830
02:09:43.50 --> 02:09:46.50
It's really weird to place the find yourself in for sure.

1831
02:09:46.50 --> 02:09:49.50
Yeah, and I think the fact that you're 20 at the time,

1832
02:09:49.50 --> 02:09:54.50
you know, at least an MMA fighter that's retired or can't fight anymore.

1833
02:09:54.50 --> 02:09:58.50
And he's 37, 33, whatever.

1834
02:09:58.50 --> 02:10:02.50
You know, that's a different deal.

1835
02:10:02.50 --> 02:10:07.50
This is a real important conversation that you have here.

1836
02:10:07.50 --> 02:10:08.50
Fast forward a little bit.

1837
02:10:08.50 --> 02:10:11.50
A member of the surgical team, which monitor my progress

1838
02:10:11.50 --> 02:10:14.50
walked in near the tail end of this conversation.

1839
02:10:14.50 --> 02:10:17.50
He was just there to do routine checkups and to introduce himself.

1840
02:10:17.50 --> 02:10:20.50
He was a young guy who seemed very well put together in high speed.

1841
02:10:20.50 --> 02:10:24.50
I check my limbs one by one for circulation and feeling.

1842
02:10:24.50 --> 02:10:26.50
Judd put a question to him.

1843
02:10:26.50 --> 02:10:30.50
Hey Doc, Braxton has been told that he may never walk again.

1844
02:10:30.50 --> 02:10:34.50
He thinks he is never going to be able to stand in a river to fly fish or hunt or hike

1845
02:10:34.50 --> 02:10:35.50
or ride horses again.

1846
02:10:35.50 --> 02:10:37.50
Can you talk to him?

1847
02:10:37.50 --> 02:10:42.50
I concentrated on him hoping to read his expressions for tells of lies.

1848
02:10:42.50 --> 02:10:46.50
He proceeded to give me all the reasons why I may be able to do those things again.

1849
02:10:46.50 --> 02:10:51.50
He covered every angle including some caveats, such as I may have to use a cane to hike

1850
02:10:51.50 --> 02:10:56.50
or limit the distance that I traveled and only fish shallow holes, etc.

1851
02:10:56.50 --> 02:10:59.50
But he was telling the truth.

1852
02:10:59.50 --> 02:11:03.50
Then at the end of his answer, he said the most important thing I have ever been told

1853
02:11:03.50 --> 02:11:07.50
either before or since.

1854
02:11:07.50 --> 02:11:12.50
Braxton, I think you can walk again but you are going to have to do it soon.

1855
02:11:12.50 --> 02:11:17.50
You have too much soft tissue damage to risk allowing your muscles to atrophy any further.

1856
02:11:17.50 --> 02:11:23.50
If you don't start now, you may never walk again at least without the use of a cane or a walker.

1857
02:11:23.50 --> 02:11:29.50
Even in everyday activities, it is all up to you.

1858
02:11:29.50 --> 02:11:32.50
It is all up to you, I repeated.

1859
02:11:32.50 --> 02:11:35.50
It is all up to me, even in a situation like this one.

1860
02:11:35.50 --> 02:11:41.50
My body may have been badly bruised but it is one spirit that determines the outcome of a tragedy

1861
02:11:41.50 --> 02:11:43.50
not a doctor's prognosis.

1862
02:11:43.50 --> 02:11:46.50
That was exactly what I needed to hear in that moment.

1863
02:11:46.50 --> 02:11:49.50
I needed decisive language and a kick in the ass.

1864
02:11:49.50 --> 02:11:53.50
Not some sugarcoded version of what may or may not happen.

1865
02:11:53.50 --> 02:11:59.50
There was probably not anything that young surgeon said which I had not been told before.

1866
02:11:59.50 --> 02:12:01.50
But I had never heard that truth until right then.

1867
02:12:01.50 --> 02:12:14.50
The word he said, the order he chose to use and the conviction with which he said them were as perfect for me as if the universe had handcrafted that message.

1868
02:12:14.50 --> 02:12:19.50
It is on you.

1869
02:12:19.50 --> 02:12:25.50
I can see how when someone says, well, you know it could happen.

1870
02:12:25.50 --> 02:12:29.50
You could walk again or yeah you might be able to do this.

1871
02:12:29.50 --> 02:12:33.50
It is almost like people are inviting you just to leave it up to fate.

1872
02:12:33.50 --> 02:12:37.50
It is almost like they are trying not to tell you that it is not possible.

1873
02:12:37.50 --> 02:12:41.50
Almost like how women will sometimes do with their kids.

1874
02:12:41.50 --> 02:12:43.50
You draw great.

1875
02:12:43.50 --> 02:12:45.50
That is beautiful.

1876
02:12:45.50 --> 02:12:49.50
It is kind of like that.

1877
02:12:49.50 --> 02:12:54.50
It feels like that a little bit, especially coming from a primary care of a surgeon or something.

1878
02:12:54.50 --> 02:13:00.50
You can do this because you know that they are pushing it off onto the next guy and pushing down the timeline.

1879
02:13:00.50 --> 02:13:03.50
So when you get a guy that is like, no man, you can do it.

1880
02:13:03.50 --> 02:13:05.50
If you want to do it, you can do it.

1881
02:13:05.50 --> 02:13:07.50
You can figure it out.

1882
02:13:07.50 --> 02:13:09.50
It is really, which is the truth.

1883
02:13:09.50 --> 02:13:10.50
It is true.

1884
02:13:10.50 --> 02:13:11.50
It is true.

1885
02:13:11.50 --> 02:13:12.50
Virtually everything.

1886
02:13:12.50 --> 02:13:13.50
You know what I mean?

1887
02:13:13.50 --> 02:13:19.50
If your spinal cord is severed, you are in a different circumstance.

1888
02:13:19.50 --> 02:13:29.50
But if it is not, you can probably get out of that, or have a certain sense, whatever that helped situation in, you can probably change it.

1889
02:13:29.50 --> 02:13:34.50
So at this point, I am going to fast forward a little bit.

1890
02:13:34.50 --> 02:13:37.50
You are still not, it is not fast forward in that far.

1891
02:13:37.50 --> 02:13:42.50
But you go to Arlington Cemetery.

1892
02:13:42.50 --> 02:13:46.50
And you are not really truly walking yet.

1893
02:13:46.50 --> 02:13:52.50
But you go there and you decide you are going to walk.

1894
02:13:52.50 --> 02:13:54.50
You say, my legs trembled underneath me.

1895
02:13:54.50 --> 02:13:58.50
I saw another sign that read simply silence and respect.

1896
02:13:58.50 --> 02:14:03.50
My arms shook as I pressed into my canes to grind myself forward another step.

1897
02:14:03.50 --> 02:14:08.50
It felt like my bones were going to explode under the force of my body each time I transitioned my weight.

1898
02:14:08.50 --> 02:14:10.50
We trot on slowly.

1899
02:14:10.50 --> 02:14:17.50
We made our way by the rows and rows of heroes sacrificed on the altar of freedom at a snail's pace.

1900
02:14:17.50 --> 02:14:21.50
But with the same determination, they had brought into combat.

1901
02:14:21.50 --> 02:14:25.50
I was either going to walk the entire way or die trying.

1902
02:14:25.50 --> 02:14:28.50
I don't know how far we walked that morning exactly.

1903
02:14:28.50 --> 02:14:32.50
But it was at least a mile from the gate to section 60.

1904
02:14:32.50 --> 02:14:34.50
And I had tracked every step of it.

1905
02:14:34.50 --> 02:14:39.50
My arms ached and shook as my quadriceps just quivered their way through the steps.

1906
02:14:39.50 --> 02:14:43.50
The rest periods between legs of the journey grew longer as we went along.

1907
02:14:43.50 --> 02:14:47.50
But I never went back to that wheelchair.

1908
02:14:47.50 --> 02:14:52.50
When we reached the sign that said section 60, I did not want to stop anymore.

1909
02:14:52.50 --> 02:14:55.50
Braxton, you should probably take a break here.

1910
02:14:55.50 --> 02:14:56.50
Don't overdo it.

1911
02:14:56.50 --> 02:14:57.50
No, I'm okay.

1912
02:14:57.50 --> 02:15:00.50
I responded the sweat pouring from my face.

1913
02:15:00.50 --> 02:15:04.50
When we were inside section 60's brown boundaries,

1914
02:15:04.50 --> 02:15:11.50
they must have taken us another hour to reach Sergeant Kansas graveside.

1915
02:15:11.50 --> 02:15:16.50
Along with the slow pace we traveled due to my fatigue, the week and the weekening pain threshold.

1916
02:15:16.50 --> 02:15:23.50
I read nearly every headstone I walked by on the way, each one adding more time and new significance to the journey.

1917
02:15:23.50 --> 02:15:31.50
But also giving me a little more fuel to feed the desire to remain erect.

1918
02:15:31.50 --> 02:15:34.50
Every step made me miserable.

1919
02:15:34.50 --> 02:15:37.50
Pain radiated from my hips to my knees.

1920
02:15:37.50 --> 02:15:41.50
The agony had grown so immense that several times I thought that I might throw up because of it.

1921
02:15:41.50 --> 02:15:44.50
But we never gave up.

1922
02:15:44.50 --> 02:15:55.50
I trudged every torturous pace of that march out of respect for Sergeant Can and the 250,000 fallen warriors he lay with.

1923
02:15:55.50 --> 02:16:11.50
When we finally reached his grave side and read Adam Lee Can, Sergeant United States Marine Corps, January 25, 1982, January 5, 2006.

1924
02:16:11.50 --> 02:16:20.50
BSM with the Purple Heart Operation I Racky Freedom.

1925
02:16:20.50 --> 02:16:24.50
I lowered myself to a knee and wept.

1926
02:16:24.50 --> 02:16:26.50
Not because of the pain I was experiencing.

1927
02:16:26.50 --> 02:16:32.50
But because I had the nerve, the flat out audacity to complain about it.

1928
02:16:32.50 --> 02:16:38.50
These hundreds of thousands of heroes had given their lives to provide me with a safe place to recover.

1929
02:16:38.50 --> 02:16:45.50
And all I had thought about up to that point was how hard my time had been.

1930
02:16:45.50 --> 02:16:51.50
Whatever I had given in service to my country and my brothers, paled in comparison to what they had done.

1931
02:16:51.50 --> 02:16:56.50
Who was I to feel so sorry for myself? Who was I to complain about my situation?

1932
02:16:56.50 --> 02:16:59.50
I was above ground.

1933
02:16:59.50 --> 02:17:10.50
There was not a sole laid to rest in that holy shrine who would not have gladly taken my place if they could have.

1934
02:17:10.50 --> 02:17:16.50
It became clear to me in that moment that I really did have nothing to complain about.

1935
02:17:16.50 --> 02:17:27.50
And every time I did complain, it should be seen as a slap in the face to far better men than I will ever be.

1936
02:17:27.50 --> 02:17:40.50
When I had finished paying my final respects to Sergeant Can and the men immediately surrounding him, I stood up on both canes and began my long walk out of the cemetery.

1937
02:17:40.50 --> 02:17:42.50
A brand new sense of urgency to recover.

1938
02:17:42.50 --> 02:17:47.50
A newfound pool of motivation to draw from. I was going to beat this thing.

1939
02:17:47.50 --> 02:17:57.50
I was going to fight to take my life back again, not just because I wanted to, but because I had to because they couldn't.

1940
02:17:57.50 --> 02:18:21.50
Now that pledge was not an easy pledge to take, not an easy pledge to keep.

1941
02:18:21.50 --> 02:18:36.50
Even coming back from that, I mean you, you know, you're, you started swell enough, everything started swell enough from doing that long walk.

1942
02:18:36.50 --> 02:18:43.50
Later on, you say, I'll be enough just sitting there trying to need the pain from my legs did help ease the frustration a bit.

1943
02:18:43.50 --> 02:18:52.50
I stopped thinking about the things I couldn't do, like open a cab door on my own, and started thinking about what I just accomplished, walking some real distances.

1944
02:18:52.50 --> 02:18:57.50
Distances no doctor who had operated on me had ever imagined possible. How did I do that? I wondered.

1945
02:18:57.50 --> 02:19:00.50
It took me years to get to the bottom of that question.

1946
02:19:00.50 --> 02:19:10.50
The truth is that the only reason I'd walked that far in that condition was because I had reticine that reminded me that Arlington was not about me.

1947
02:19:10.50 --> 02:19:16.50
I didn't care enough about myself or my future to grind through that kind of torment.

1948
02:19:16.50 --> 02:19:25.50
Self gratification, nor self improvement was enough to motivate me. My own ego is nowhere near big enough to carry me through that.

1949
02:19:25.50 --> 02:19:34.50
I had done it because I did not want to disrespect Sergeant Can or any of the rest who had given their lives at war.

1950
02:19:34.50 --> 02:19:39.50
I made that journey because I had a reason bigger than myself.

1951
02:19:39.50 --> 02:19:46.50
I needed to cling to that maximum.

1952
02:19:46.50 --> 02:19:57.50
When I read that and that's one of the points in this book when I'm talking about these internal thoughts that you've had and things that you figured out along the way,

1953
02:19:57.50 --> 02:20:04.50
I was thinking about the fact that oftentimes we don't mind letting ourselves down,

1954
02:20:04.50 --> 02:20:12.50
but we just wouldn't want to let down our friends, our teammates. I mean, I know for a fact in the military and the seal teams,

1955
02:20:12.50 --> 02:20:17.50
the worst possible thing you want to have happen. You look, if you disappoint yourself,

1956
02:20:17.50 --> 02:20:21.50
okay, that's bad, that sucks, but you don't want to let down your teammates.

1957
02:20:21.50 --> 02:20:29.50
To me, that you said it took you years to get to the bottom of that question and that helped me get to the bottom of that question.

1958
02:20:29.50 --> 02:20:42.50
Of how, what is it that these guys will do anything for their friends? They'll do anything for their friends. They'll take better care of their friends than they will of themselves,

1959
02:20:42.50 --> 02:20:51.50
which is a crazy thought. I mean, I know you listen to some Jordan Peterson and read some Jordan Peterson and one of the things that he says is,

1960
02:20:51.50 --> 02:20:59.50
it's like treat yourself as if you were someone that you would want to take care of. To similar thoughts.

1961
02:20:59.50 --> 02:21:05.50
I guess I probably were, I got it and just said, and I've never put the two together actually.

1962
02:21:05.50 --> 02:21:12.50
Yeah, I think it's also true, like any time you're doing anything hard, like if you're ready to quit,

1963
02:21:12.50 --> 02:21:20.50
you can find something, you know, like find some other reason, it'll put, like your ego is just only so big.

1964
02:21:20.50 --> 02:21:26.50
And it's also really easy to be like, man, no one's even going to know I quit, rationalize.

1965
02:21:26.50 --> 02:21:33.50
Yeah, and no one knows that bulls up down there. I'm the only one that knows that bulls in that canyon, you know, no one's going to know if I don't knock down there.

1966
02:21:33.50 --> 02:21:43.50
You just gotta find something to force you, you know, like for me, it's like I'm going to go home and tell my buddy that I pulled that bull out of that canyon.

1967
02:21:43.50 --> 02:21:48.50
It's like a toxic shit to my buddy's to, you know, like just as much as you love.

1968
02:21:48.50 --> 02:21:52.50
It's kind of like that given take of the relationship, you know, both ends.

1969
02:21:52.50 --> 02:21:57.50
Yeah, that was a moving section of this book, man.

1970
02:21:57.50 --> 02:22:04.50
That whole section was rough to read.

1971
02:22:04.50 --> 02:22:12.50
And those canes are the ones with the four ends on them, you know, not like a regular cane.

1972
02:22:12.50 --> 02:22:17.50
I ended up getting regular canes later from all to read, but those were the different kind.

1973
02:22:17.50 --> 02:22:23.50
And so it gave me like a little bit more stability. I think I don't regular canes on a profile, few times, for sure.

1974
02:22:23.50 --> 02:22:28.50
And you know that road is, it's like a good road and everything.

1975
02:22:28.50 --> 02:22:31.50
So it's like the walkin wasn't that bad.

1976
02:22:31.50 --> 02:22:33.50
It's just pretty busted up.

1977
02:22:33.50 --> 02:22:39.50
And yeah, and I had never, I'd never been to Arlington before. I'd never seen it.

1978
02:22:39.50 --> 02:22:51.50
And there really is, I don't know, spirituals right word or what, but it really conveys some sense of reverence, especially once you get into the actual grounds.

1979
02:22:51.50 --> 02:22:59.50
The tour center is one thing, but you know, once you actually get in there, it's a very powerful moving place.

1980
02:22:59.50 --> 02:23:07.50
And then you start to realize like, every one of these stones is an actual person, not just like a picture you saw on a movie or something.

1981
02:23:07.50 --> 02:23:10.50
You know, it's like, here's his name.

1982
02:23:10.50 --> 02:23:13.50
And then many cases here is why I found the other side.

1983
02:23:13.50 --> 02:23:20.50
And you just see like generations of dudes who have died, you know, and women too now.

1984
02:23:20.50 --> 02:23:29.50
Yeah, it's, it's really, it's one of those places in the world where earth and this country where you just have to go experience it.

1985
02:23:29.50 --> 02:23:37.50
And there's really, I don't think anyone can write powerfully enough to explain what it's really like there.

1986
02:23:37.50 --> 02:23:49.50
Yeah, I think, you know, when you know guys, when you know guys that are buried there and you can kind of relate, relate that individual and you look at all those graves.

1987
02:23:49.50 --> 02:23:54.50
You just, you know that every one of those is like you said a person.

1988
02:23:54.50 --> 02:23:59.50
It's like that's a, that's a mother, a father, a son, a daughter.

1989
02:23:59.50 --> 02:24:06.50
It's like, like, someone that was known and I think it's easy to fall.

1990
02:24:06.50 --> 02:24:09.50
It's easy to just call a soldier a soldier, right?

1991
02:24:09.50 --> 02:24:11.50
And now remember that that soldier's a person.

1992
02:24:11.50 --> 02:24:17.50
And I think when you know, when you know some of those people in those graves,

1993
02:24:17.50 --> 02:24:25.50
it's easy to expand and connect that personal side to each and every one of those graves don'ts.

1994
02:24:25.50 --> 02:24:30.50
Knowing the sacrifice isn't just somebody in a uniform.

1995
02:24:30.50 --> 02:24:43.50
It's a person like I said, it's a brother, a sister, a father, a son, a daughter, a mother and it's freaking heartbreaking to be in there.

1996
02:24:43.50 --> 02:24:59.50
Um, meanwhile, um, as this is going on, you still have, um, you know, you're still working through like your physical issues.

1997
02:24:59.50 --> 02:25:07.50
And it sounds like your hand was just like, it's like, I can't, well, I look at your hand.

1998
02:25:07.50 --> 02:25:12.50
When I was reading this, I, I, I, I didn't think your hand was going to be in the kind of shape.

1999
02:25:12.50 --> 02:25:14.50
I was pretty, pretty freaking good to go.

2000
02:25:14.50 --> 02:25:19.50
When, when I read stuff like this, large, this is from the book, large chunks of skin.

2001
02:25:19.50 --> 02:25:21.50
We're falling away from my hand.

2002
02:25:21.50 --> 02:25:31.50
They were not thin and dry strips like those shed from snakes, but thick and wet like scales floating away from a rotten fish that's washed up into the shallows.

2003
02:25:31.50 --> 02:25:35.50
I couldn't help but feeling like this part of my body belonged to a corpse.

2004
02:25:35.50 --> 02:25:39.50
The visuals, bad and romadi, but that day it looked as if it were dying.

2005
02:25:39.50 --> 02:25:45.50
This day it looked like the hand was already dead.

2006
02:25:45.50 --> 02:25:50.50
Like it was foreshadowing all that was to become a me if I were to succumb to my wounds.

2007
02:25:50.50 --> 02:25:57.50
And though I was still doing much better, the fate of my, the, I was still, the fate was still far from out of the question.

2008
02:25:57.50 --> 02:26:04.50
I still had an infection in my body, blood clots in my legs, and IVC filter that could break apart it any minute,

2009
02:26:04.50 --> 02:26:15.50
and no one's addressing my brain injury yet. Even if I did live through the whole ordeal, I would be doing it with most of the function, without most of the function of my right hand.

2010
02:26:15.50 --> 02:26:29.50
All that I had ever done in my life, which I had found worth doing, whether it be shooting, working, weightlifting, boxing, wrestling, cowboying, bull riding, or even war fighting, had required not just two hands, but two strong and capable hands.

2011
02:26:29.50 --> 02:26:35.50
This hand, which had once defined me, now looked as if it were gone forever.

2012
02:26:35.50 --> 02:26:46.50
I had not given it permission to give up yet, yet there it was, and sat crippled atop my wrist, a symbol of not just what could it become of me,

2013
02:26:46.50 --> 02:26:54.50
but of how little controller I had over my fate. The futility of resistance can be maddening.

2014
02:26:54.50 --> 02:27:02.50
That's another thing that's interesting about this book is you can tell a freak it, you can tell it's not a Hollywood movie,

2015
02:27:02.50 --> 02:27:08.50
because in a Hollywood movie it's like there's some point where everything turns, and everything's like good now, you know,

2016
02:27:08.50 --> 02:27:12.50
they write the book with that perfect story arc, and disay in a perfect story arc.

2017
02:27:12.50 --> 02:27:22.50
It's like up, down, up, down, up, down. Sometimes the down is way lower than the up, and that's one of the things that makes it powerful is it's freaking,

2018
02:27:22.50 --> 02:27:30.50
and it's like realistic, and it also makes it powerful because like every time I read something,

2019
02:27:30.50 --> 02:27:36.50
and I'd be like, oh yeah, there it is. Like I'm like a brainwashed by Hollywood, you know,

2020
02:27:36.50 --> 02:27:42.50
on reading it like, oh yeah, you went and visited the grave, here's the turnaround, and then no.

2021
02:27:42.50 --> 02:27:48.50
You know, like, oh, you know, this happens and we're going to hit some more of those, but that's life, right?

2022
02:27:48.50 --> 02:27:54.50
Yeah, that's the real thing. Yeah, there's a couple of even after the book was over that happened to you.

2023
02:27:54.50 --> 02:27:58.50
That's going to be in the second book, I guess. Yeah, I don't know.

2024
02:28:02.50 --> 02:28:08.50
What about this? This one section where this physical therapist is, is she comes into bend your finger?

2025
02:28:08.50 --> 02:28:14.50
No, no, no. Yeah, she says, hey, I'm going to bend your finger, and you say, don't, it's fused.

2026
02:28:14.50 --> 02:28:18.50
She says, no, no, it's not. We just need, you need to just suck it up.

2027
02:28:18.50 --> 02:28:22.50
We're trying to get me to do this church and steeple thing.

2028
02:28:22.50 --> 02:28:26.50
Do this, but this finger, this, not what doesn't move.

2029
02:28:26.50 --> 02:28:28.50
She's like pulling on it.

2030
02:28:28.50 --> 02:28:32.50
So you're telling, you're telling her it's fused. It's a funny part of the book.

2031
02:28:32.50 --> 02:28:34.50
Dude, how bad did she feel?

2032
02:28:34.50 --> 02:28:36.50
I think she felt pretty dumb.

2033
02:28:36.50 --> 02:28:38.50
I was sitting there waiting like, free to break.

2034
02:28:38.50 --> 02:28:42.50
Yeah, you know when you got assist when you were a kid in your grandpa,

2035
02:28:42.50 --> 02:28:44.50
you were the Bible and whack it with an hammer.

2036
02:28:44.50 --> 02:28:46.50
You know, I was just waiting for her to come hit it with a book.

2037
02:28:46.50 --> 02:28:50.50
So I was like, well, that wreck can't really feel it worth it.

2038
02:28:50.50 --> 02:28:58.50
Yeah, because my, right here in my wrist is where that median nerve was transsected.

2039
02:28:58.50 --> 02:29:02.50
So I really couldn't feel this part of my hand.

2040
02:29:02.50 --> 02:29:06.50
I carted it all at that time. So it wasn't like really hurting.

2041
02:29:06.50 --> 02:29:10.50
I mean, a little kind of sort of, like, the point.

2042
02:29:10.50 --> 02:29:12.50
The way you describe it, she's like getting tired.

2043
02:29:12.50 --> 02:29:14.50
She's like, she's tired.

2044
02:29:14.50 --> 02:29:16.50
You're freaking out.

2045
02:29:16.50 --> 02:29:18.50
She was like, this big of a round.

2046
02:29:18.50 --> 02:29:19.50
Yeah.

2047
02:29:19.50 --> 02:29:22.50
And yeah, she was kind of attractive too.

2048
02:29:22.50 --> 02:29:26.50
So I was just like, oh, there it is.

2049
02:29:26.50 --> 02:29:28.50
Soccer.

2050
02:29:28.50 --> 02:29:32.50
You're eating all kind of sympathy when that thing.

2051
02:29:34.50 --> 02:29:38.50
You end up getting this deal where they're going to send you the community-based health care organization,

2052
02:29:38.50 --> 02:29:42.50
which is, which is, you get to go back home basically to heal up.

2053
02:29:42.50 --> 02:29:48.50
Yeah, I think they've since ended the program, but, but it seemed to you at the time.

2054
02:29:48.50 --> 02:29:49.50
Very good.

2055
02:29:49.50 --> 02:29:50.50
Like freaking awesome.

2056
02:29:50.50 --> 02:29:52.50
You didn't have to be stuck out there while to read anymore.

2057
02:29:52.50 --> 02:29:54.50
You could, you could head home.

2058
02:29:54.50 --> 02:29:55.50
Yeah.

2059
02:29:55.50 --> 02:29:55.50
Yeah.

2060
02:29:55.50 --> 02:29:57.50
Because it, so I'm starting to catch you off.

2061
02:29:57.50 --> 02:30:00.50
The traditional path that Walter read is your inpatient,

2062
02:30:00.50 --> 02:30:04.50
and then you're in outpatient, but you stay on Wall to Read campus and like,

2063
02:30:04.50 --> 02:30:06.50
you know, these barracks and stuff.

2064
02:30:06.50 --> 02:30:09.50
And then you're just doing all of your outpatient work.

2065
02:30:09.50 --> 02:30:10.50
It Walter read.

2066
02:30:10.50 --> 02:30:12.50
So guys are there for like two, three years sometimes.

2067
02:30:12.50 --> 02:30:14.50
Just going through all of their outpatient.

2068
02:30:14.50 --> 02:30:17.50
And so the army is like, well, it's just sent them home, do outpatient care at home.

2069
02:30:17.50 --> 02:30:18.50
Yeah.

2070
02:30:18.50 --> 02:30:21.50
And that's kind of how the, I mean, I, you are stoked.

2071
02:30:21.50 --> 02:30:23.50
You're stoked to get out of there.

2072
02:30:23.50 --> 02:30:25.50
Yeah, yeah, I can go back home freaking hates it.

2073
02:30:25.50 --> 02:30:28.50
I was going to give me out of this book.

2074
02:30:28.50 --> 02:30:33.50
You got some, again, there's so many, so much stuff.

2075
02:30:33.50 --> 02:30:37.50
Well, that people got to get the book for as you're, as you're making progress.

2076
02:30:37.50 --> 02:30:40.50
And as you start driving across the country and as, you know, you get a new car.

2077
02:30:40.50 --> 02:30:43.50
You get in some situations that are all in here that are,

2078
02:30:43.50 --> 02:30:46.50
good, good reading, man.

2079
02:30:46.50 --> 02:30:50.50
Not always the, not always the most positive thing, but it's at least it's good reading.

2080
02:30:50.50 --> 02:30:51.50
It's, it's smart, it's good.

2081
02:30:51.50 --> 02:30:55.50
Fast forward a little bit.

2082
02:30:55.50 --> 02:30:57.50
Now you're driving across country, you're getting home.

2083
02:30:57.50 --> 02:31:00.50
Even in the dark night, the green agricultural fields of home seem to glow

2084
02:31:00.50 --> 02:31:03.50
as our headlights showing on the little mountains in the valley.

2085
02:31:03.50 --> 02:31:04.50
It was too late to see my family.

2086
02:31:04.50 --> 02:31:06.50
They were all in bed long before you arrived.

2087
02:31:06.50 --> 02:31:09.50
For most of our drive, I've been communicating with my two closest friends,

2088
02:31:09.50 --> 02:31:10.50
Dan and Josh.

2089
02:31:10.50 --> 02:31:13.50
They had planned a meet-up set the house when we arrived.

2090
02:31:13.50 --> 02:31:14.50
I hope they were still awake.

2091
02:31:14.50 --> 02:31:15.50
I sent them another message.

2092
02:31:15.50 --> 02:31:18.50
We're just getting into town.

2093
02:31:18.50 --> 02:31:20.50
The words, welcome home, corporma coy.

2094
02:31:20.50 --> 02:31:23.50
We're written in big block letters across a banner that's spanned.

2095
02:31:23.50 --> 02:31:27.50
The two rain load and the, or two, two lane road at the northern,

2096
02:31:27.50 --> 02:31:29.50
most end of town.

2097
02:31:29.50 --> 02:31:33.50
At the southernmost end of town, home at last, I belted out through a grin.

2098
02:31:33.50 --> 02:31:37.50
The steps in my house have been covered with a homemade wheelchair ramp

2099
02:31:37.50 --> 02:31:38.50
engineered by my stepfather.

2100
02:31:38.50 --> 02:31:42.50
My wife went to the door, opened it, and carried our bags inside.

2101
02:31:42.50 --> 02:31:47.50
Another bit of my pride died is I helplessly watched her do the heavy lifting.

2102
02:31:47.50 --> 02:31:52.50
I reached across my body and jerk the lever, which bound the vehicles door.

2103
02:31:52.50 --> 02:31:56.50
My right hand was still too weak to the perform the tasks.

2104
02:31:56.50 --> 02:32:00.50
So, of course, what's the smart move of this juncture?

2105
02:32:00.50 --> 02:32:02.50
Start drinking with your friends.

2106
02:32:02.50 --> 02:32:04.50
Which is why you too.

2107
02:32:04.50 --> 02:32:06.50
I did.

2108
02:32:06.50 --> 02:32:10.50
Yeah, opioids and every other kind of thing in there.

2109
02:32:10.50 --> 02:32:14.50
You start drinking with your friends.

2110
02:32:14.50 --> 02:32:20.50
This is again, when I talked about one of the things that makes this book so good

2111
02:32:20.50 --> 02:32:25.50
is just the fact that you're just going to tell the truth of what you did and how you did it.

2112
02:32:25.50 --> 02:32:27.50
And this is one of those things that I was reading.

2113
02:32:27.50 --> 02:32:29.50
I was like, okay, check.

2114
02:32:29.50 --> 02:32:31.50
So you're drinking with your friends.

2115
02:32:31.50 --> 02:32:33.50
Literally the first night you're back and finally someone says,

2116
02:32:33.50 --> 02:32:35.50
you know, so what happened?

2117
02:32:35.50 --> 02:32:36.50
How did you get hit?

2118
02:32:36.50 --> 02:32:41.50
And you say in the book, I started the story with why my team had been at the glass factory

2119
02:32:41.50 --> 02:32:42.50
in the first place.

2120
02:32:42.50 --> 02:32:46.50
I tried to inform them of the political climate in Almbar and how the arguments at home

2121
02:32:46.50 --> 02:32:48.50
were shaping the battlefield over there.

2122
02:32:48.50 --> 02:32:51.50
I gave them as much backstory as I could, hoping to give them enough

2123
02:32:51.50 --> 02:32:54.50
to gather a layman's understanding of our experiences.

2124
02:32:54.50 --> 02:33:00.50
Then I got to the January 5th and the build up to the explosion that crippled me and killed our brothers.

2125
02:33:00.50 --> 02:33:03.50
I had been descriptive and honest up to that point,

2126
02:33:03.50 --> 02:33:07.50
but for some reason that I may never fully understand, I started lying.

2127
02:33:07.50 --> 02:33:12.50
I said that I acted in heroic ways after being wounded by the suicide bomber when I didn't.

2128
02:33:12.50 --> 02:33:14.50
Maybe it was just the whiskey.

2129
02:33:14.50 --> 02:33:15.50
Maybe it was insecurity.

2130
02:33:15.50 --> 02:33:20.50
Maybe it was survivors guilt screaming in my head that I could have should have done more.

2131
02:33:20.50 --> 02:33:23.50
Whatever the motivation was exactly, I will never know.

2132
02:33:23.50 --> 02:33:27.50
But there I stood in my kitchen, pants down to my ankles,

2133
02:33:27.50 --> 02:33:31.50
leaning awkwardly on my cane, pointing at the scars, covering my limbs,

2134
02:33:31.50 --> 02:33:35.50
and lying about battlefield heroics I never exhibited.

2135
02:33:41.50 --> 02:33:44.50
Yeah, I shouldn't actually cringe still.

2136
02:33:44.50 --> 02:33:46.50
But I am as true.

2137
02:33:48.50 --> 02:33:50.50
You want to hear my assessment?

2138
02:33:50.50 --> 02:33:51.50
Sure.

2139
02:33:51.50 --> 02:33:53.50
Of this situation?

2140
02:33:53.50 --> 02:33:56.50
I think this is what happens to dudes.

2141
02:33:56.50 --> 02:34:00.50
When you're trying to tell somebody a story,

2142
02:34:00.50 --> 02:34:04.50
what your goal is is to make them feel what you felt.

2143
02:34:04.50 --> 02:34:10.50
And so, if I'm looking at you and I'm telling you a story,

2144
02:34:10.50 --> 02:34:16.50
and I want to tell you that like, a mortar hit,

2145
02:34:16.50 --> 02:34:20.50
let's say a mortar hit, 50 yards away from me.

2146
02:34:20.50 --> 02:34:21.50
It's scary.

2147
02:34:21.50 --> 02:34:24.50
And it scares the shit out of you.

2148
02:34:24.50 --> 02:34:26.50
It goes off and you're like, whoa.

2149
02:34:26.50 --> 02:34:29.50
And like, it can kill you, even 50 yards away.

2150
02:34:29.50 --> 02:34:30.50
It can kill you.

2151
02:34:30.50 --> 02:34:31.50
But it did.

2152
02:34:31.50 --> 02:34:35.50
So if I'm telling you a story, and especially if you're a civilian,

2153
02:34:35.50 --> 02:34:39.50
I want you to know, I want you to feel what I felt.

2154
02:34:39.50 --> 02:34:43.50
That freaking explosion scared the shit out of me.

2155
02:34:43.50 --> 02:34:46.50
So when I tell you some of the details,

2156
02:34:46.50 --> 02:34:51.50
I think there's a tendency to say this freaking mortar hit,

2157
02:34:51.50 --> 02:34:53.50
five feet from me.

2158
02:34:53.50 --> 02:34:59.50
And I'm just trying to let you feel what I felt

2159
02:34:59.50 --> 02:35:01.50
in the best way that I can.

2160
02:35:01.50 --> 02:35:06.50
So when I'm thinking, you know, even going out,

2161
02:35:06.50 --> 02:35:09.50
like going outside the gate, going outside the wire,

2162
02:35:09.50 --> 02:35:12.50
walking out there, trying to capture what it's like.

2163
02:35:12.50 --> 02:35:15.50
It's hard to convey those.

2164
02:35:15.50 --> 02:35:19.50
And you want someone to feel it so bad, what you felt.

2165
02:35:19.50 --> 02:35:20.50
I don't know.

2166
02:35:20.50 --> 02:35:23.50
I think that drives guys sometimes to say things that maybe

2167
02:35:23.50 --> 02:35:27.50
on 100% on point, not 100% true.

2168
02:35:27.50 --> 02:35:32.50
The spirit of what they say is true, but the facts aren't.

2169
02:35:32.50 --> 02:35:33.50
You know?

2170
02:35:33.50 --> 02:35:36.50
So I think that's some of it.

2171
02:35:36.50 --> 02:35:38.50
You know, just when you, when you rattled through the, like,

2172
02:35:38.50 --> 02:35:39.50
you're not really sure why you did it.

2173
02:35:39.50 --> 02:35:42.50
I think part of it is because you want people to feel

2174
02:35:42.50 --> 02:35:45.50
at least some of what you felt.

2175
02:35:45.50 --> 02:35:49.50
And we know we're not always the best at convey in the feelings.

2176
02:35:49.50 --> 02:35:51.50
And especially when people are looking at you,

2177
02:35:51.50 --> 02:35:54.50
and you can see that they're not quite getting it.

2178
02:35:54.50 --> 02:35:55.50
You know?

2179
02:35:55.50 --> 02:35:58.50
And you can see the look on some civilians face that's like

2180
02:35:58.50 --> 02:35:59.50
50 meters away.

2181
02:35:59.50 --> 02:36:01.50
That doesn't sound like a big deal.

2182
02:36:01.50 --> 02:36:02.50
You know?

2183
02:36:02.50 --> 02:36:03.50
I'm looking at echo right now.

2184
02:36:03.50 --> 02:36:04.50
He's kind of like 50 meters.

2185
02:36:04.50 --> 02:36:05.50
40 meters.

2186
02:36:05.50 --> 02:36:06.50
No cross.

2187
02:36:06.50 --> 02:36:08.50
Yeah, half the football field.

2188
02:36:08.50 --> 02:36:09.50
You know, you kidding me?

2189
02:36:09.50 --> 02:36:10.50
What a joke.

2190
02:36:10.50 --> 02:36:13.50
Um, so that's what I had to want to do the things.

2191
02:36:13.50 --> 02:36:15.50
Look, the other other Nickender's, the sure,

2192
02:36:15.50 --> 02:36:17.50
but when I've talked to guys,

2193
02:36:17.50 --> 02:36:20.50
um, when I've heard stories from guys from like,

2194
02:36:20.50 --> 02:36:21.50
hmm,

2195
02:36:21.50 --> 02:36:23.50
I'm suspect.

2196
02:36:23.50 --> 02:36:25.50
I usually just take into account,

2197
02:36:25.50 --> 02:36:26.50
oh, they just want me to feel what they felt.

2198
02:36:26.50 --> 02:36:28.50
They just want me to feel what they felt.

2199
02:36:28.50 --> 02:36:30.50
And I think that adds to it a little bit.

2200
02:36:30.50 --> 02:36:32.50
This is a really interesting perspective.

2201
02:36:32.50 --> 02:36:33.50
I've never considered.

2202
02:36:33.50 --> 02:36:34.50
Yeah.

2203
02:36:34.50 --> 02:36:36.50
Um,

2204
02:36:36.50 --> 02:36:38.50
and this is what's weird.

2205
02:36:38.50 --> 02:36:40.50
And you, this is what you say. The lies and embellishments.

2206
02:36:40.50 --> 02:36:42.50
I was telling, we're chipping away at what was left

2207
02:36:42.50 --> 02:36:44.50
to my pride even as I spouted them.

2208
02:36:44.50 --> 02:36:46.50
But really, what did I have left to be proud of?

2209
02:36:46.50 --> 02:36:48.50
That's the other crazy things.

2210
02:36:48.50 --> 02:36:50.50
Like you're talking to civilians.

2211
02:36:50.50 --> 02:36:52.50
Like they, you don't, you don't need to say.

2212
02:36:52.50 --> 02:36:55.50
Like you're like, hey, I got blown up, man.

2213
02:36:55.50 --> 02:36:58.50
Like that's good enough of the story as you're going to get.

2214
02:36:58.50 --> 02:36:59.50
You know?

2215
02:36:59.50 --> 02:37:01.50
Uh,

2216
02:37:01.50 --> 02:37:05.50
I was a shortened, pasty frail and morally compromised shell

2217
02:37:05.50 --> 02:37:09.50
of whatever kind of man I had been once before.

2218
02:37:09.50 --> 02:37:12.50
Pride, what pride could be expected of a man who's forced to urinate

2219
02:37:12.50 --> 02:37:14.50
in a plastic bottle next to his bed

2220
02:37:14.50 --> 02:37:17.50
because he's too weak to walk to the bathroom at night.

2221
02:37:17.50 --> 02:37:19.50
So again, in your mind,

2222
02:37:19.50 --> 02:37:22.50
you think you got to build up like yourself,

2223
02:37:22.50 --> 02:37:26.50
but bro, I mean, anybody that's there looking at you like,

2224
02:37:26.50 --> 02:37:28.50
hey, man, you obviously,

2225
02:37:28.50 --> 02:37:31.50
freaking, you know, got after it.

2226
02:37:31.50 --> 02:37:35.50
You want to, or I'm front of it or something.

2227
02:37:35.50 --> 02:37:38.50
Yeah, man, I don't know.

2228
02:37:38.50 --> 02:37:41.50
You're right. I had to really never consider that.

2229
02:37:41.50 --> 02:37:43.50
You're right.

2230
02:37:43.50 --> 02:37:46.50
Yeah, it's weird when there's civilians involved too,

2231
02:37:46.50 --> 02:37:48.50
because they literally have no idea.

2232
02:37:48.50 --> 02:37:50.50
You know, like,

2233
02:37:50.50 --> 02:37:53.50
it's only in your head, you know?

2234
02:37:53.50 --> 02:37:55.50
It's only in your head that you think,

2235
02:37:55.50 --> 02:38:00.50
maybe I, you know, I need to tell them that I did this.

2236
02:38:00.50 --> 02:38:02.50
There, there, bro, you went to Iraq.

2237
02:38:02.50 --> 02:38:04.50
These people were sitting around and freaking you,

2238
02:38:04.50 --> 02:38:07.50
tall, whatever, drinking beers, you know?

2239
02:38:07.50 --> 02:38:09.50
Well, I've been, you got to remember two.

2240
02:38:09.50 --> 02:38:11.50
I've been in the hospital living in my head

2241
02:38:11.50 --> 02:38:14.50
24 hours a day for months at that point,

2242
02:38:14.50 --> 02:38:16.50
because they can't really talk to anybody.

2243
02:38:16.50 --> 02:38:18.50
Even though they're army nurses and stuff,

2244
02:38:18.50 --> 02:38:20.50
they might as well be civilians too.

2245
02:38:20.50 --> 02:38:22.50
They, you know,

2246
02:38:22.50 --> 02:38:23.50
I'm just, they just work in hospital.

2247
02:38:23.50 --> 02:38:26.50
I'm not saying they don't do powerful and great things.

2248
02:38:26.50 --> 02:38:29.50
So far as like being able to relate or understand

2249
02:38:29.50 --> 02:38:32.50
they can't, you know, they can't relate.

2250
02:38:32.50 --> 02:38:36.50
And the, when I was in the neuroward at Walter Reed,

2251
02:38:36.50 --> 02:38:38.50
the kid got, kid not a kid.

2252
02:38:38.50 --> 02:38:42.50
Soldier, it was like my same age, got put into a room.

2253
02:38:42.50 --> 02:38:44.50
Next to me, they got shot through the throat

2254
02:38:44.50 --> 02:38:46.50
and Afghanistan.

2255
02:38:46.50 --> 02:38:48.50
And once he got to where he could talk again,

2256
02:38:48.50 --> 02:38:49.50
at least everyone's the one,

2257
02:38:49.50 --> 02:38:51.50
we'd be able to both, you know, shoot a little bit.

2258
02:38:51.50 --> 02:38:54.50
But outside of that, and he couldn't talk for,

2259
02:38:54.50 --> 02:38:55.50
you know, he was struggling.

2260
02:38:55.50 --> 02:38:57.50
I mean, he got, like a 5-4-R,

2261
02:38:57.50 --> 02:39:00.50
I think it was through his neck.

2262
02:39:00.50 --> 02:39:03.50
But so yeah, so you also just constantly living

2263
02:39:03.50 --> 02:39:04.50
in your own head.

2264
02:39:04.50 --> 02:39:06.50
So maybe when I was home,

2265
02:39:06.50 --> 02:39:08.50
like that perspective that you shared earlier,

2266
02:39:08.50 --> 02:39:09.50
I had never considered,

2267
02:39:09.50 --> 02:39:11.50
maybe I was doing exactly that,

2268
02:39:11.50 --> 02:39:13.50
but to myself, you know,

2269
02:39:13.50 --> 02:39:15.50
I don't know.

2270
02:39:21.50 --> 02:39:24.50
So I'm going to fast forward a little bit again.

2271
02:39:24.50 --> 02:39:29.50
You go to visit your mom's house

2272
02:39:29.50 --> 02:39:31.50
and your grandma and your granddad,

2273
02:39:31.50 --> 02:39:32.50
or there.

2274
02:39:32.50 --> 02:39:37.50
And, you know, you make it in.

2275
02:39:37.50 --> 02:39:38.50
Your grandma's there.

2276
02:39:38.50 --> 02:39:41.50
She's like glad you made it home.

2277
02:39:41.50 --> 02:39:45.50
You are, you know, hey, where's grandpa?

2278
02:39:45.50 --> 02:39:48.50
He's over in the couch, she pointed.

2279
02:39:48.50 --> 02:39:50.50
I popped down beside my childhood hero,

2280
02:39:50.50 --> 02:39:52.50
and clung his tightly as I could manage.

2281
02:39:52.50 --> 02:39:54.50
His arms felt weaker than they once had,

2282
02:39:54.50 --> 02:39:56.50
but not a thing could diminish his mountainous

2283
02:39:56.50 --> 02:39:57.50
stature in my eyes.

2284
02:39:57.50 --> 02:39:59.50
We sat there for a while in embrace.

2285
02:39:59.50 --> 02:40:01.50
I almost felt like a kid who had fallen down

2286
02:40:01.50 --> 02:40:02.50
and scraped his knees.

2287
02:40:02.50 --> 02:40:03.50
I just wanted to hear him tell me

2288
02:40:03.50 --> 02:40:05.50
it was going to be alright.

2289
02:40:05.50 --> 02:40:07.50
I'm so proud of you, he whispered.

2290
02:40:07.50 --> 02:40:08.50
I love you, grandpa.

2291
02:40:08.50 --> 02:40:09.50
I'm sorry.

2292
02:40:09.50 --> 02:40:11.50
Tears welled up in my eyes.

2293
02:40:11.50 --> 02:40:13.50
He told me that he was proud of me,

2294
02:40:13.50 --> 02:40:14.50
just like I had hoped he would,

2295
02:40:14.50 --> 02:40:16.50
but it didn't make me feel good.

2296
02:40:16.50 --> 02:40:17.50
I didn't deserve that accolade,

2297
02:40:17.50 --> 02:40:19.50
and I knew it.

2298
02:40:19.50 --> 02:40:21.50
When he said he was proud of me,

2299
02:40:21.50 --> 02:40:23.50
he was talking about who I was as a man,

2300
02:40:23.50 --> 02:40:25.50
not when I had accomplished physically.

2301
02:40:25.50 --> 02:40:27.50
I knew that.

2302
02:40:27.50 --> 02:40:30.50
The very night before I had demonstrated a lowly character.

2303
02:40:30.50 --> 02:40:32.50
Why should he be proud of me?

2304
02:40:32.50 --> 02:40:34.50
He wouldn't be if he had known that I was a kind of man

2305
02:40:34.50 --> 02:40:36.50
who lied to his friends.

2306
02:40:36.50 --> 02:40:39.50
Oh, you dummy, what the hell are you sorry for?

2307
02:40:39.50 --> 02:40:41.50
Knock it off before I kick you right in the ass

2308
02:40:41.50 --> 02:40:42.50
grandpa responded.

2309
02:40:42.50 --> 02:40:45.50
I buried my head into his once broad

2310
02:40:45.50 --> 02:40:48.50
and muscular shoulder trying to hide my shame.

2311
02:40:48.50 --> 02:40:50.50
I don't know how long I stayed there for,

2312
02:40:50.50 --> 02:40:52.50
but what did I say longer if you let me?

2313
02:40:52.50 --> 02:40:54.50
I spent the better part of a week

2314
02:40:54.50 --> 02:40:56.50
building that damn wheelchair ramp

2315
02:40:56.50 --> 02:40:57.50
and you didn't even use it.

2316
02:40:57.50 --> 02:40:59.50
My stepdad quipped.

2317
02:40:59.50 --> 02:41:01.50
I'm never getting back in that goddamn chair again.

2318
02:41:01.50 --> 02:41:02.50
I billowed.

2319
02:41:02.50 --> 02:41:04.50
Bracks and watch your mouth, mom yelled.

2320
02:41:04.50 --> 02:41:06.50
Watch it or I'll sock you on.

2321
02:41:06.50 --> 02:41:08.50
Grandpa joined in.

2322
02:41:14.50 --> 02:41:15.50
Fast forward.

2323
02:41:15.50 --> 02:41:17.50
Like many other soldiers at war,

2324
02:41:17.50 --> 02:41:19.50
my home front had changed considerably

2325
02:41:19.50 --> 02:41:20.50
during my absence.

2326
02:41:20.50 --> 02:41:22.50
My great grandmother who might have been

2327
02:41:22.50 --> 02:41:23.50
very close to past away,

2328
02:41:23.50 --> 02:41:25.50
but she had written a letter while I was in

2329
02:41:25.50 --> 02:41:27.50
the rymoddy saying she expected to go soon.

2330
02:41:27.50 --> 02:41:29.50
Her death was not so unexpected.

2331
02:41:29.50 --> 02:41:30.50
My stepdad ramp,

2332
02:41:30.50 --> 02:41:32.50
I've never seen a day to day in his life

2333
02:41:32.50 --> 02:41:33.50
before I left for the war,

2334
02:41:33.50 --> 02:41:36.50
but while I was going, he developed prostate cancer.

2335
02:41:36.50 --> 02:41:37.50
The chemotherapy age

2336
02:41:37.50 --> 02:41:39.50
and dramatically in just one year,

2337
02:41:39.50 --> 02:41:41.50
but even this was less jarring

2338
02:41:41.50 --> 02:41:43.50
than the sight of that wheelchair.

2339
02:41:43.50 --> 02:41:46.50
Everyone's life has an event horizon.

2340
02:41:46.50 --> 02:41:48.50
My grandfather's had just come earlier

2341
02:41:48.50 --> 02:41:49.50
than I anticipated.

2342
02:41:49.50 --> 02:41:52.50
That was all there was to it.

2343
02:41:52.50 --> 02:41:54.50
I just wasn't ready for the sight of my hero,

2344
02:41:54.50 --> 02:41:55.50
the man who raised me,

2345
02:41:55.50 --> 02:41:57.50
when no one else wanted to

2346
02:41:57.50 --> 02:41:58.50
crawling into a chair.

2347
02:42:06.50 --> 02:42:08.50
When that's because he's,

2348
02:42:08.50 --> 02:42:10.50
you know, basically he's now in a wheelchair.

2349
02:42:10.50 --> 02:42:12.50
Yeah, and I had watched him battle

2350
02:42:12.50 --> 02:42:14.50
as a back injury for

2351
02:42:14.50 --> 02:42:17.50
since I was like 14 years old.

2352
02:42:17.50 --> 02:42:19.50
He just kept working.

2353
02:42:19.50 --> 02:42:21.50
He was a very famous family.

2354
02:42:21.50 --> 02:42:24.50
And so I knew exactly how he ended up in that chair.

2355
02:42:24.50 --> 02:42:27.50
So it kind of hit even harder.

2356
02:42:33.50 --> 02:42:35.50
So the whole reason that you came up,

2357
02:42:35.50 --> 02:42:37.50
the whole reason you were able to come home

2358
02:42:37.50 --> 02:42:40.50
was this community-based health care organization.

2359
02:42:40.50 --> 02:42:42.50
It's two and a half hours

2360
02:42:42.50 --> 02:42:44.50
you had to drive to get there.

2361
02:42:44.50 --> 02:42:46.50
Kind of checking in here.

2362
02:42:46.50 --> 02:42:48.50
Corporal McCoy, how the hell are you?

2363
02:42:48.50 --> 02:42:50.50
A deep familiar voice boomed out

2364
02:42:50.50 --> 02:42:51.50
from behind the vehicle.

2365
02:42:51.50 --> 02:42:53.50
I'm rolling along top.

2366
02:42:53.50 --> 02:42:54.50
How you been?

2367
02:42:54.50 --> 02:42:56.50
It was Sergeant K, a senior entiel

2368
02:42:56.50 --> 02:42:58.50
that a new well in fact he had been the guy

2369
02:42:58.50 --> 02:42:59.50
that approved my request of volunteer

2370
02:42:59.50 --> 02:43:00.50
for the Plymouth to Ramadi.

2371
02:43:00.50 --> 02:43:02.50
I've been well, cowboy.

2372
02:43:02.50 --> 02:43:04.50
I wanted to introduce you to your new

2373
02:43:04.50 --> 02:43:06.50
Paltoon Sergeant Master Sergeant Dillonger.

2374
02:43:06.50 --> 02:43:07.50
Hello Sergeant.

2375
02:43:07.50 --> 02:43:08.50
I said, extending my hand.

2376
02:43:08.50 --> 02:43:10.50
He grabbed my hand and proclaimed young man.

2377
02:43:10.50 --> 02:43:12.50
I expected me to soldier in a wheelchair.

2378
02:43:12.50 --> 02:43:14.50
You seen him around anywhere?

2379
02:43:14.50 --> 02:43:17.50
Yeah, well, I'm doing my best to stay out

2380
02:43:17.50 --> 02:43:19.50
of that damn thing, Sergeant.

2381
02:43:19.50 --> 02:43:22.50
He's a grizzly old bastard, Corporal.

2382
02:43:22.50 --> 02:43:24.50
Most of us around here just call him Bulldog.

2383
02:43:24.50 --> 02:43:26.50
First Sergeant K, chimed in.

2384
02:43:26.50 --> 02:43:28.50
Master Sergeant Dillonger Bulldog

2385
02:43:28.50 --> 02:43:31.50
was a short stocky combat veteran of the Vietnam War.

2386
02:43:31.50 --> 02:43:32.50
Usually he paced around Brit,

2387
02:43:32.50 --> 02:43:34.50
briskly with a cigarette and his lips

2388
02:43:34.50 --> 02:43:36.50
looking for someone to ask to chew.

2389
02:43:36.50 --> 02:43:38.50
He didn't beat around the bush about anything.

2390
02:43:38.50 --> 02:43:40.50
If you had a thought, you were liable to hear it.

2391
02:43:40.50 --> 02:43:42.50
But he cared about the men in his platoon.

2392
02:43:42.50 --> 02:43:45.50
He played no games, especially the armies.

2393
02:43:45.50 --> 02:43:47.50
Later on in our relationship,

2394
02:43:47.50 --> 02:43:49.50
when there was a mandatory formation

2395
02:43:49.50 --> 02:43:52.50
upcoming that he didn't think I needed to drive up for.

2396
02:43:52.50 --> 02:43:56.50
He simply called me on my phone and asked me where I was and whether I was okay.

2397
02:43:56.50 --> 02:43:59.50
Then he told the commander that I was accounted for over time.

2398
02:43:59.50 --> 02:44:02.50
I developed a deep admiration and respect for that man,

2399
02:44:02.50 --> 02:44:04.50
the kind that no rank or ribbons can earn.

2400
02:44:04.50 --> 02:44:06.50
He sounds like a character.

2401
02:44:06.50 --> 02:44:08.50
He was so funny.

2402
02:44:08.50 --> 02:44:10.50
And just the best guy.

2403
02:44:10.50 --> 02:44:14.50
He got me my first job after I got out.

2404
02:44:14.50 --> 02:44:15.50
He was just a really good guy.

2405
02:44:15.50 --> 02:44:18.50
I ended up dying a couple of years ago.

2406
02:44:18.50 --> 02:44:20.50
He was a long cancer.

2407
02:44:20.50 --> 02:44:23.50
He was 70 years tall by then.

2408
02:44:23.50 --> 02:44:25.50
He was a little over guy.

2409
02:44:25.50 --> 02:44:32.50
He was a kind of leader that expected you to do whatever you were supposed to do.

2410
02:44:32.50 --> 02:44:36.50
But he would really shield you from nonsense

2411
02:44:36.50 --> 02:44:40.50
that you didn't need to be involved in.

2412
02:44:40.50 --> 02:44:41.50
Yeah.

2413
02:44:41.50 --> 02:44:44.50
You say in the book, your corporate,

2414
02:44:44.50 --> 02:44:46.50
I know you've been through a lot of shit in the last year.

2415
02:44:46.50 --> 02:44:48.50
I'm old enough to know what this shit is like.

2416
02:44:48.50 --> 02:44:49.50
I did my time in NAMM.

2417
02:44:49.50 --> 02:44:51.50
Our war wasn't squawk compared to yours.

2418
02:44:51.50 --> 02:44:54.50
I interrupted shut the fuck up McCoy cut me off.

2419
02:44:54.50 --> 02:44:55.50
I've seen plenty of war.

2420
02:44:55.50 --> 02:44:56.50
It's all the same shit.

2421
02:44:56.50 --> 02:44:57.50
Our war's might have been different,

2422
02:44:57.50 --> 02:44:59.50
but you did your time in the shit.

2423
02:44:59.50 --> 02:45:03.50
You don't owe me any, you don't owe me or anyone else a fucking caveat.

2424
02:45:03.50 --> 02:45:04.50
Understood?

2425
02:45:04.50 --> 02:45:05.50
I nodded.

2426
02:45:05.50 --> 02:45:07.50
What I'm trying to say is this unit is different.

2427
02:45:07.50 --> 02:45:09.50
This is a medical holdover company.

2428
02:45:09.50 --> 02:45:10.50
We're not a line unit.

2429
02:45:10.50 --> 02:45:11.50
But don't get it wrong.

2430
02:45:11.50 --> 02:45:12.50
This is still the army.

2431
02:45:12.50 --> 02:45:14.50
There's still enough bullshit here to pack.

2432
02:45:14.50 --> 02:45:16.50
10, 5 tons.

2433
02:45:16.50 --> 02:45:19.50
I will do my best to make sure you only eat the shit you have to.

2434
02:45:19.50 --> 02:45:21.50
But I swear to God, if you fuck with me,

2435
02:45:21.50 --> 02:45:24.50
I will have your cripple bass on the next fucking flight to DC.

2436
02:45:24.50 --> 02:45:25.50
Understood?

2437
02:45:25.50 --> 02:45:26.50
Roger Sergeant.

2438
02:45:26.50 --> 02:45:28.50
I will call yourself on any time.

2439
02:45:28.50 --> 02:45:29.50
I feel like it.

2440
02:45:29.50 --> 02:45:30.50
If I want to, if you don't answer,

2441
02:45:30.50 --> 02:45:33.50
you better be dead dying or in the middle of a medical appointment.

2442
02:45:33.50 --> 02:45:34.50
Understood?

2443
02:45:34.50 --> 02:45:35.50
Yes, Sergeant.

2444
02:45:35.50 --> 02:45:36.50
You call me first thing in the morning.

2445
02:45:36.50 --> 02:45:37.50
I will know everything.

2446
02:45:37.50 --> 02:45:40.50
I will know about every medical appointment on your schedule.

2447
02:45:40.50 --> 02:45:41.50
And if you leave your house for any reason,

2448
02:45:41.50 --> 02:45:43.50
I don't give a shit if it's just a go outside to piss on the tree.

2449
02:45:43.50 --> 02:45:45.50
You will ask permission first.

2450
02:45:45.50 --> 02:45:46.50
Copy.

2451
02:45:46.50 --> 02:45:47.50
Roger Sergeant.

2452
02:45:47.50 --> 02:45:48.50
All right.

2453
02:45:48.50 --> 02:45:50.50
Now get that pretty little wife for your home and let her relax.

2454
02:45:50.50 --> 02:45:50.50
Corp.

2455
02:45:50.50 --> 02:45:51.50
You're free to go.

2456
02:45:51.50 --> 02:45:52.50
Roger Sergeant.

2457
02:45:52.50 --> 02:45:55.50
I'd only made a few steps when I heard his voice call out again.

2458
02:45:55.50 --> 02:45:55.50
Corp.

2459
02:45:55.50 --> 02:45:56.50
McCoy.

2460
02:45:56.50 --> 02:45:57.50
Yes, Sergeant.

2461
02:45:57.50 --> 02:45:58.50
Welcome home, son.

2462
02:45:58.50 --> 02:45:59.50
Glad you made it.

2463
02:45:59.50 --> 02:46:01.50
Thank you, Sergeant.

2464
02:46:01.50 --> 02:46:02.50
So there you go, man.

2465
02:46:02.50 --> 02:46:04.50
Freak in.

2466
02:46:04.50 --> 02:46:05.50
Just on.

2467
02:46:05.50 --> 02:46:06.50
Stud.

2468
02:46:06.50 --> 02:46:07.50
Stud.

2469
02:46:07.50 --> 02:46:08.50
Stud.

2470
02:46:08.50 --> 02:46:09.50
Um.

2471
02:46:09.50 --> 02:46:15.50
Again, you know, that sounds all cool.

2472
02:46:15.50 --> 02:46:16.50
I'm all happy.

2473
02:46:16.50 --> 02:46:17.50
I'm reading that part of my call.

2474
02:46:17.50 --> 02:46:19.50
Here's a good turning point.

2475
02:46:19.50 --> 02:46:22.50
Uh, then you fast forward a little bit.

2476
02:46:22.50 --> 02:46:25.50
I told myself that my, none of my behavior was an overreaction when taking in context.

2477
02:46:25.50 --> 02:46:29.50
After all, these little bursts of extra pain may have been slight when considered on their own.

2478
02:46:29.50 --> 02:46:33.50
But when piled on top of the constant and never ending aches, I endured.

2479
02:46:33.50 --> 02:46:35.50
They seemed excruciating.

2480
02:46:35.50 --> 02:46:39.50
I heard every second I was awake and nighttime brought me no reprieve.

2481
02:46:39.50 --> 02:46:44.50
When I lay in my bed at whatever time seemed appropriate that evening, I didn't sleep.

2482
02:46:44.50 --> 02:46:46.50
What's more, I never expected to sleep.

2483
02:46:46.50 --> 02:46:49.50
How could I sleep when I heard so much?

2484
02:46:49.50 --> 02:46:51.50
What had, what had I become?

2485
02:46:51.50 --> 02:46:53.50
I was being weak.

2486
02:46:53.50 --> 02:46:57.50
I had once thought my mental toughness was as sure as the sun coming up in the morning.

2487
02:46:57.50 --> 02:46:59.50
But I was broken down again.

2488
02:46:59.50 --> 02:47:04.50
Before I was wounded, I used to claim that I had never quit in my life and nothing could make me.

2489
02:47:04.50 --> 02:47:05.50
But I was wrong.

2490
02:47:05.50 --> 02:47:09.50
I had hit many, many breaking points during recovery.

2491
02:47:09.50 --> 02:47:13.50
The internal dialogue world about my head and endless cycle.

2492
02:47:13.50 --> 02:47:18.50
I was being soft and I knew it, but rationalizing the pain was so damn easy to do.

2493
02:47:18.50 --> 02:47:23.50
I had made it all sorts of excuses over the course of the past few months.

2494
02:47:23.50 --> 02:47:29.50
And although it should have been the last time I had made such justifications, it wasn't.

2495
02:47:35.50 --> 02:47:41.50
So you mentioned in a brief moment a little bit ago, opioids.

2496
02:47:45.50 --> 02:47:48.50
Scary thing. They've been in the news a bunch.

2497
02:47:48.50 --> 02:47:54.50
You say on the question of addiction, many of us had little to say to begin with.

2498
02:47:54.50 --> 02:47:56.50
This is an interesting point.

2499
02:47:56.50 --> 02:47:58.50
I didn't choose to be addicted.

2500
02:47:58.50 --> 02:48:02.50
I didn't even understand the degree to which I was addicted.

2501
02:48:02.50 --> 02:48:05.50
There was no true first time so to speak.

2502
02:48:05.50 --> 02:48:11.50
I never had the an opportunity to debate the potential pitfalls of drugs with a sober mind.

2503
02:48:11.50 --> 02:48:18.48
The fact is, like with so many other soldiers, my addiction was little more than the tragic

2504
02:48:18.48 --> 02:48:20.48
side effect of healing.

2505
02:48:20.48 --> 02:48:27.48
I left Walter Reed taking hundreds of milligrams of oxycontin a day.

2506
02:48:27.48 --> 02:48:36.48
Once a million doctors told me that I had been prescribed dosages in multiples of what he wrote his terminal cancer patients.

2507
02:48:36.48 --> 02:48:38.48
I didn't choose that.

2508
02:48:38.48 --> 02:48:45.48
Neither did thousands of others, thousands of other men and women who found themselves in similar circumstances.

2509
02:48:45.48 --> 02:48:49.48
I did however make things much worse.

2510
02:48:49.48 --> 02:48:51.48
And that can't be hung on anyone.

2511
02:48:51.48 --> 02:48:53.48
But me.

2512
02:48:53.48 --> 02:48:57.48
This caveat to the story is meant to be read as a sort of table setting,

2513
02:48:57.48 --> 02:49:01.48
not an invasion of personal responsibility.

2514
02:49:01.48 --> 02:49:03.48
I've learned many lessons through my journey.

2515
02:49:03.48 --> 02:49:12.48
Probably the most important of them being taking ownership of one's failures is the best way to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

2516
02:49:12.48 --> 02:49:21.48
If there's a way to rationally place blame on another, or on fate itself, that is all the more reason to look inward for a culprit,

2517
02:49:21.48 --> 02:49:28.48
because that nave is the only one you can reliably alter.

2518
02:49:28.48 --> 02:49:32.48
A little bit of extreme ownership going on there.

2519
02:49:32.48 --> 02:49:33.48
Yeah.

2520
02:49:33.48 --> 02:49:36.48
Yeah, I took that for me.

2521
02:49:36.48 --> 02:49:37.48
Sorry man.

2522
02:49:37.48 --> 02:49:38.48
I probably thought.

2523
02:49:38.48 --> 02:49:39.48
Oh, by all means.

2524
02:49:39.48 --> 02:49:41.48
You can't take what's free.

2525
02:49:41.48 --> 02:49:43.48
It is true though.

2526
02:49:43.48 --> 02:49:45.48
It's one of those deals.

2527
02:49:45.48 --> 02:49:46.48
I'm sure you've.

2528
02:49:46.48 --> 02:49:50.48
I know I know you wrote similar things in your first book.

2529
02:49:50.48 --> 02:49:59.48
There is a way to view this these sort of situations where you can look at it like, well.

2530
02:49:59.48 --> 02:50:03.48
Sure, maybe I was forced into this and that wasn't my fault.

2531
02:50:03.48 --> 02:50:08.48
But the only way I get out of this is if I just.

2532
02:50:08.48 --> 02:50:14.48
Control the parts that I can control and I can't I can't do that without taking ownership of the things that I'm screwing up.

2533
02:50:14.48 --> 02:50:19.48
So you you almost have to just say okay we the first play doesn't matter anymore.

2534
02:50:19.48 --> 02:50:24.48
Now it's you know third and ten and I got to figure out how to crunch these yards.

2535
02:50:24.48 --> 02:50:25.48
That's it.

2536
02:50:25.48 --> 02:50:26.48
That's it.

2537
02:50:26.48 --> 02:50:27.48
That's it.

2538
02:50:27.48 --> 02:50:32.48
And I you know you say you stole from you actually talk about you give credit to.

2539
02:50:32.48 --> 02:50:44.48
Uh, extreme ownership the book and in in this so I appreciate the shout out and I'm glad that it was able to something that you able to connect to.

2540
02:50:44.48 --> 02:50:50.48
So that's sort of the the opening that you give on this dealing with oxy cotton and whatnot.

2541
02:50:50.48 --> 02:50:56.48
You say the hardest part of managing pain was not dealing with the sharp off and crippling surges it was the constant aching in retrospect.

2542
02:50:56.48 --> 02:51:01.48
I think the most profound effect of the oxy cotton was on my sanity.

2543
02:51:01.48 --> 02:51:10.48
And you will never ending dull aches that engulfed my lower extremities spine and right hand were psychologically tortures.

2544
02:51:10.48 --> 02:51:19.48
It wasn't exactly excruciating but the utter lack of respect was brutal.

2545
02:51:19.48 --> 02:51:30.48
And that's you know you you you kind of go into that but I wanted to highlight the fact that you say a couple times like it was just absolutely constant unending pain all the time.

2546
02:51:30.48 --> 02:51:43.48
You think about what what what this if it's let's say the Soviets have the ability to inflict this kind of thing like invisible damage.

2547
02:51:43.48 --> 02:51:48.48
I mean it's not invisible but like let's say they could make invisible damage and chronic pain.

2548
02:51:48.48 --> 02:51:52.48
That's that that would have been the preferred torture mechanism.

2549
02:51:52.48 --> 02:51:59.48
You know because they can send you back into the real world and like whenever you're ready we can push the button or you know remove the

2550
02:51:59.48 --> 02:52:02.48
device or whatever and make the pain stop.

2551
02:52:02.48 --> 02:52:04.48
Yeah but you gotta do what we tell you do do do.

2552
02:52:04.48 --> 02:52:05.48
Yeah.

2553
02:52:05.48 --> 02:52:11.48
But that's how a lot of these guys are living for months and years at a time and I think we don't really.

2554
02:52:11.48 --> 02:52:16.48
I don't think we don't go deep deep enough into this psychology that often.

2555
02:52:16.48 --> 02:52:25.48
When we tell our own stories we sort of kind of gloss over that achy you know dull almost maniacal pain.

2556
02:52:25.48 --> 02:52:29.48
And a lot of dudes even just like construction guys are living like this for sure.

2557
02:52:29.48 --> 02:52:35.48
You want to buy their drink in like 30 pack and I or whatever because they're backs jacked up or whatever.

2558
02:52:35.48 --> 02:52:36.48
Yeah.

2559
02:52:36.48 --> 02:52:52.48
And like you said they still got to build the pay the family to feed and speaking of drinking at this point you say you're drinking half a fifth of bourbon a night on top of the pain killers.

2560
02:52:52.48 --> 02:53:00.48
At one point one of your friends I guess teaches you how to snort oxygotten.

2561
02:53:00.48 --> 02:53:11.48
Yes and things change while I was gone and yeah I mean I'd like seen this kind of stuff done as a kid like you'd see people you know you'd a party.

2562
02:53:11.48 --> 02:53:24.48
So let me see people like roll up a dollar bill or something you're not just drinking but there's like a whole process to be able to snort oxygotten and that was nice to me.

2563
02:53:24.48 --> 02:53:31.48
When you so you do it this guy kind of shows you what's up teaches you how to snort oxygotten.

2564
02:53:31.48 --> 02:53:40.48
Once you do it you feel like you're gonna puke he tells you go puke you go puke and then you say from the book after I've vomited I felt better than I have ever.

2565
02:53:40.48 --> 02:53:43.48
I've never had in my entire life.

2566
02:53:43.48 --> 02:53:59.48
Yeah when I was speaking at schools for a while you still tell teachers and like the worst thing you can tell kid is that it's not fun because then they know you lied to them.

2567
02:53:59.48 --> 02:54:12.48
Because it is it really is like the most invigorating it's really as boys it's honestly difficult to put in the words how good it feels it's like you for it.

2568
02:54:12.48 --> 02:54:21.48
But if you if you a lot of people say drugs are all terrible and you know and then their first experiences like what have you been hiding from me dude this is amazing.

2569
02:54:21.48 --> 02:54:31.48
You know then they're more likely to you know to it's much better to focus on how bad things can get rather than telling it's not fun.

2570
02:54:31.48 --> 02:54:41.48
Same thing if like drinking I mean how many preachers daughters and dope to preachers daughters thanks.

2571
02:54:41.48 --> 02:54:51.48
What the guy knew of front of mind told he ended up in jail and whatnot but he said the first time he ever did crystal meth it was the only thing he ever wanted to do for the rest of his life.

2572
02:54:51.48 --> 02:55:05.48
Like it was just like so he just loved it very first time done he was done he was addicted and he ended up you know addicted to tell you what the jail.

2573
02:55:05.48 --> 02:55:27.48
You say my desire to continue on was eroding many factors were contributing to this like the impossibility of finding refrain from the physical torment but my inability to come to terms with the fact that my best friends were still in harm's way living in the hell that was Ramadi in 2006 without me and my own be poor behavioral choices were the worst of them.

2574
02:55:27.48 --> 02:55:40.48
Once I had scrolled the timeless military mantra death before dishonor did death before dishonor on the walls of my hooch and I rack now here on the home front where that code should be easiest to live up to.

2575
02:55:40.48 --> 02:55:59.48
I failed and I continued to fail every day over and over the surest form of justification ran through my head what does it matter anyways.

2576
02:55:59.48 --> 02:56:06.48
Once I started abusing pain medication my mental health went downhill rapidly but I didn't care I felt nothing.

2577
02:56:06.48 --> 02:56:20.48
Even chasing the dragon became a sort of mundane routine doctor appointed visits doctor appointments visits with specialists in physical therapy sessions were too similar to telepart the only piece of me that a grown was my opioid addiction.

2578
02:56:20.48 --> 02:56:23.48
And it had metastasized.

2579
02:56:23.48 --> 02:56:35.48
In the morning I'd wake up wheel into the bathroom grind up another oxy cotton in eagerly devour it as if it were the cure to rather than a cause of myself hatred.

2580
02:56:35.48 --> 02:56:47.48
After my usual half days work at the hospital I stopped by the liquor store and picked up a fifth of bourbon often times feeling safely away from the presence of the local law enforcement I opened the bottle of moment I exited the freeway.

2581
02:56:47.48 --> 02:56:57.48
Most days I drove right past my house headed for the nearest solitude I could find I long for a place where I could be alone just me and my thoughts.

2582
02:56:57.48 --> 02:57:06.48
My thoughts nearly never left for my body it was almost as if I still lived there in my mind I'd become bitter and angry I hated everyone and everything around me.

2583
02:57:06.48 --> 02:57:15.48
Don't any of these assholes realize where a war right now good matter dying in an ungrateful countries half a world away what the fuck is everyone smiling about.

2584
02:57:15.48 --> 02:57:22.48
The only people I still loved were thousands of miles away and I had no way to talk to them.

2585
02:57:22.48 --> 02:57:37.48
I slid my way out of the truck placing most of my weight on the cane in my left hand and the rest on my left leg as I had become my new normal pain shop through my body my hip wobbled.

2586
02:57:37.48 --> 02:57:45.48
It couldn't handle the redistribution of weight I let out a short grown fuck this shit.

2587
02:57:45.48 --> 02:57:53.48
I held a loud broadcasting my complaint to God the universe and whatever else may be listening.

2588
02:57:53.48 --> 02:58:01.48
I emerged from my home a short while later with my semi automatic 45 caliber handgun and a fresh bottle of pills in tow.

2589
02:58:01.48 --> 02:58:10.48
I climbed into my truck yank the lever into reverse and started from my favorite little mountain valley in those east hills.

2590
02:58:10.48 --> 02:58:18.48
I stepped up to the edge of the valley in front of the old cabin hoping that someone might find me before my decomposing corpse began to blow.

2591
02:58:18.48 --> 02:58:22.48
I didn't want my mom to have to deal with that image for the rest of her life.

2592
02:58:22.48 --> 02:58:28.48
I retrieved my lighter bill credit card CD case and oxy cotton.

2593
02:58:28.48 --> 02:58:31.48
I was ready to get on with it.

2594
02:58:31.48 --> 02:58:35.48
I kept pounding whiskey while I crushed up my narcotics.

2595
02:58:35.48 --> 02:58:42.48
I feel the warm blanket of euphoria. Their in-perceptible chains would bring.

2596
02:58:42.48 --> 02:58:46.48
Line spread across the CD case placed in the middle of my center console.

2597
02:58:46.48 --> 02:58:50.48
I rolled up and already chalky bill and snorted the first line.

2598
02:58:50.48 --> 02:58:58.48
I feel better already. I fought to myself as I chased it down with another swig of the bottle I was holding between my knees.

2599
02:58:58.48 --> 02:59:02.48
My pistol sat on the passenger seat beside me.

2600
02:59:02.48 --> 02:59:11.48
I reached over with my right hand, wrapped its two working fingers around the grip and pushed the frame into my thigh to stabilize it.

2601
02:59:11.48 --> 02:59:14.48
Then I racked the slide with my left hand.

2602
02:59:14.48 --> 02:59:17.48
The gun now main ready.

2603
02:59:17.48 --> 02:59:23.48
I set up on my lap, muzzle toward the front of the cab.

2604
02:59:23.48 --> 02:59:26.48
Never point a weapon at anything you are not willing to destroy.

2605
02:59:26.48 --> 02:59:29.48
I took up the bottle again and had another slug.

2606
02:59:29.48 --> 02:59:33.48
I retrieved the loosely rolled bill and tightened it back into a cylinder.

2607
02:59:33.48 --> 02:59:40.48
Then I placed it at the tip of my other nostril, leaned over and softly breathed in the last of my respite.

2608
02:59:40.48 --> 02:59:43.48
Calm.

2609
02:59:43.48 --> 02:59:49.48
I stared over the dashboard at the valley that it once held many of my fondest memories.

2610
02:59:49.48 --> 02:59:53.48
The world around me slowly closed in. My eyes darkened.

2611
02:59:53.48 --> 02:59:55.48
I fumbled for the pistol in my lap.

2612
02:59:55.48 --> 03:00:03.48
I longed desperately for the bite of its cold barrel on the side of my head and the hot lead in delivery it could bring.

2613
03:00:03.48 --> 03:00:14.48
Every ounce of my soul begged for its one weight ticket to anywhere, but the nihilistic hell I lived in.

2614
03:00:14.48 --> 03:00:17.48
My eyes opened some time later.

2615
03:00:17.48 --> 03:00:23.48
A near empty bottle of whiskey on the floorboard and the song I just got back from hell by Gary Allen,

2616
03:00:23.48 --> 03:00:27.48
reverberating throughout the cab.

2617
03:00:37.48 --> 03:00:41.48
So thankfully, you passed out.

2618
03:00:41.48 --> 03:00:48.48
Yeah, I had this mix that I made.

2619
03:00:48.48 --> 03:00:56.48
That truck just had a CD boy or saw dad like this. Mix of songs and that they were all those kind of songs.

2620
03:00:56.48 --> 03:01:06.48
And I drove up to this valley that I used to go, you know, you go shoot rabbits or hunk snakes or party with the girls and this kind of stuff.

2621
03:01:06.48 --> 03:01:13.48
I just wanted to be done with the frustrated and.

2622
03:01:13.48 --> 03:01:21.48
Yeah, done. And luckily, like I just said, I passed out, man.

2623
03:01:21.48 --> 03:01:33.48
She could have been really bad. And luckily I didn't, you know, like a cute liver failure or some shit from opioids and alcohol.

2624
03:01:33.48 --> 03:01:42.48
And yeah, like physical therapy every day, I just set back after set back and then, you know, my whole entire recovery was like set back after set back.

2625
03:01:42.48 --> 03:02:00.48
And everybody was saying, I'm like, oh, all kinds of fucking drugs and you know, psych drugs and opioids and every other, you know, and my body didn't work and I was just, I was just over it.

2626
03:02:00.48 --> 03:02:03.48
I was just completely over it.

2627
03:02:03.48 --> 03:02:09.48
Didn't that, you know, wasn't like in the best marriage at the time, which how could you be, you know, and you like how could you marriage be good when you're behaving like this every day, right?

2628
03:02:09.48 --> 03:02:16.48
And so just like everything is, it like spiraled down the toilet.

2629
03:02:16.48 --> 03:02:23.48
And that's, it's not an uncommon, it's really, unfortunately, not an uncommon occurrence.

2630
03:02:23.48 --> 03:02:32.48
It's just kind of why eventually that I wanted to write the book in the first place was I was reading these other books here and there.

2631
03:02:32.48 --> 03:02:36.48
And I just didn't, I didn't feel like I didn't see anybody who was going.

2632
03:02:36.48 --> 03:02:51.48
It was, they weren't being like the, the stories weren't reflecting everything that I was saying, you know, in my own life, in my friends and you know, some guys were doing great and the other guys were really not doing great.

2633
03:02:51.48 --> 03:02:55.48
How is it that no one like saw?

2634
03:02:55.48 --> 03:03:03.48
I mean, if you're drinking that much and you're free, are they not blood testing you to see how much obedience or opioids or in your system or shit like that?

2635
03:03:03.48 --> 03:03:09.48
So I was getting blood tested every day for, I think I came across off of blood thinners by then or not.

2636
03:03:09.48 --> 03:03:19.48
When I was on blood thinners, I had to get tested every day, but they don't test for anything, but like the, I don't know if it's viscosity or what, but how, how thin your blood is.

2637
03:03:19.48 --> 03:03:23.48
And so then they just adjust your blood, their medication to that.

2638
03:03:23.48 --> 03:03:32.48
So no one was like, pissed us off from how come, and you're not talking to any freaking therapist or psychologists or chaplains or anything like that.

2639
03:03:32.48 --> 03:03:34.48
So I just just figured out he's fine.

2640
03:03:34.48 --> 03:03:42.48
Yeah, I mean, I, I was probably, I mean, I was definitely trying to blow off everybody all the time, but no, I wasn't, you know, I had to speak to a therapist.

2641
03:03:42.48 --> 03:03:47.48
I can't remember if it was three times a year, it was something like that.

2642
03:03:47.48 --> 03:03:49.48
It was somewhere, or that might have been a VA thing.

2643
03:03:49.48 --> 03:03:50.48
I can't remember.

2644
03:03:50.48 --> 03:03:55.48
Anyway, at some point there was a requirement to speak to a therapist like three times a year.

2645
03:03:55.48 --> 03:03:57.48
Um, go.

2646
03:03:57.48 --> 03:04:01.48
And that was what I was really, yeah.

2647
03:04:01.48 --> 03:04:07.48
And I don't, I wish, I really wish I knew why it got that bad, but it didn't.

2648
03:04:07.48 --> 03:04:11.48
Well, you just kind of breeze through it, and I'm, I'm freezing through the book.

2649
03:04:11.48 --> 03:04:19.48
I mean, I've skipped through a bunch of stuff where the daily grind of what you're doing, you're missing your friends and your body.

2650
03:04:19.48 --> 03:04:22.48
You're, you're not healthy the way you want to be.

2651
03:04:22.48 --> 03:04:27.48
The, the downward spiral of, oh, I'm addicted to this shit.

2652
03:04:27.48 --> 03:04:32.48
The only way to stop feeling shitty about feeling addicted to this shit is to do more of this shit that I'm addicted to.

2653
03:04:32.48 --> 03:04:33.48
Yeah.

2654
03:04:33.48 --> 03:04:45.48
Uh, so I think you, you, the way you lay it out is actually very helpful because people might be able to identify where they are on that downward spiral.

2655
03:04:45.48 --> 03:04:54.48
Yeah. And what, for me, what finally got me there, I'm saying I wish I knew it was at the very, very bottom of it, but, but, but the final catalyst was I injured my leg at physical therapy.

2656
03:04:54.48 --> 03:05:02.48
And I was just like, fuck man, you know, I can't, I can, I'm, I'm done, like this, I've had enough rollercoaster in this point.

2657
03:05:02.48 --> 03:05:08.48
You know, so I think if you're, if you're one of these people that's going through addiction and you're,

2658
03:05:08.48 --> 03:05:16.48
uh, what they call like functionally addicted, whether it's heroin or, like there's only handful of drugs that people can really do it on alcohol mostly.

2659
03:05:16.48 --> 03:05:28.48
If you're one of these like functional addicts, you should really know that it, you might hit that one catalyst that sends you to a whole, another level of it, you know what I mean?

2660
03:05:28.48 --> 03:05:37.48
Because maybe you can ride that for a while, but eventually something goes wrong and you're going to turn to that substance to help you get over that.

2661
03:05:37.48 --> 03:05:44.48
And that's going to go, you're going to be at a whole new, holy level addiction because now you just conquered another thing, you know, with that.

2662
03:05:44.48 --> 03:05:50.48
So, and yeah, like, you know, back to your other point, I think we would introduce myself.

2663
03:05:50.48 --> 03:05:53.48
I'm pretty happy about that now.

2664
03:05:53.48 --> 03:06:04.48
You know, I've said before like, when people get in these modes and these situations, like, they're like a storm cloud around their head that they think is the whole world.

2665
03:06:04.48 --> 03:06:05.48
Is this storm cloud?

2666
03:06:05.48 --> 03:06:12.48
And like anyone on the outside can look at it and say, bro, you're just, it's just around you, like you come over here, you'll be okay, you'll get out of it.

2667
03:06:12.48 --> 03:06:18.48
But from the perspective that you are in at that time, all you see is just freaking darkness everywhere.

2668
03:06:18.48 --> 03:06:20.48
Yeah.

2669
03:06:20.48 --> 03:06:24.48
Um.

2670
03:06:24.48 --> 03:06:28.48
Going back to the book here, the 15 mile drive back home dragged on.

2671
03:06:28.48 --> 03:06:31.48
This is after you got your ship back together.

2672
03:06:31.48 --> 03:06:32.48
Um.

2673
03:06:32.48 --> 03:06:37.48
My thoughts drifted back to Arlington, the last place in time where I felt strong and accomplished.

2674
03:06:37.48 --> 03:06:43.48
I remembered again how it felt to recognize how minor my complaints truly were in the grand scheme of things.

2675
03:06:43.48 --> 03:06:49.48
My sacrifice was so little and compared to those to what those heroes had given.

2676
03:06:49.48 --> 03:06:54.48
I was kicking away the blanket of freedom and secured that they provided me.

2677
03:06:54.48 --> 03:06:57.48
It is my duty to live for those who can't.

2678
03:06:57.48 --> 03:07:00.48
I had once said, who am I to be so selfish?

2679
03:07:00.48 --> 03:07:03.48
I was going to throw away my gift of life due to a little suffering.

2680
03:07:03.48 --> 03:07:06.48
Who among them would not gladly trade places with me.

2681
03:07:06.48 --> 03:07:09.48
I said to myself, hoping that it would sink in again.

2682
03:07:09.48 --> 03:07:17.48
My commitment to those heroes rekindled shame, the right kind of shame, the kind that expedites transformation washed over me.

2683
03:07:17.48 --> 03:07:24.48
Not long ago, I had stood above their sacred resting places offering whatever small, vicarious redemption I could.

2684
03:07:24.48 --> 03:07:26.48
Yet, I had failed at that promise.

2685
03:07:26.48 --> 03:07:29.48
I had tried to quit my duty in its infancy.

2686
03:07:29.48 --> 03:07:31.48
Never again.

2687
03:07:31.48 --> 03:07:35.48
I renewed my vows to them before God and whatever else was listening.

2688
03:07:35.48 --> 03:07:38.48
I promised never to give into the darkness again.

2689
03:07:38.48 --> 03:07:46.48
Now as I write this today, I wish so desperately that I could tell you honestly that I made good on this second oath, but I can't.

2690
03:07:46.48 --> 03:07:49.48
That was not the last time I failed them.

2691
03:07:49.48 --> 03:07:53.48
In fact, it was just one stumbling among a multitude.

2692
03:07:53.48 --> 03:07:55.48
I was starting to feel a little better about myself.

2693
03:07:55.48 --> 03:08:00.48
I had made a grave mistake, but luckily it hadn't been final.

2694
03:08:00.48 --> 03:08:04.48
I've got to get my shit together, I said.

2695
03:08:08.48 --> 03:08:18.48
So, you, like you said, you redo this vow kind of thing.

2696
03:08:18.48 --> 03:08:25.48
And then again, you freaking fool me into thinking like this is it.

2697
03:08:25.48 --> 03:08:26.48
This is it.

2698
03:08:26.48 --> 03:08:31.48
I made out of the darkness of like cool, we're good.

2699
03:08:31.48 --> 03:08:35.48
And you do, you know you go up, you start squirming some shit away.

2700
03:08:35.48 --> 03:08:40.48
Fast forward a little bit, these cold fronts and winter weather kept me shut up inside day and night.

2701
03:08:40.48 --> 03:08:41.48
Am I waking hours?

2702
03:08:41.48 --> 03:08:45.48
I stared out the window at dark and frigid skies when I laid down to rest the freezing world around me.

2703
03:08:45.48 --> 03:08:48.48
It was replaced by 130 degree memories and nightmares.

2704
03:08:48.48 --> 03:08:53.48
I felt as if my life was constantly on the brink of an unforeseeable, but impending doom.

2705
03:08:53.48 --> 03:08:58.48
Depression brought me back to the blanket of the bottle and the brief bliss of medication.

2706
03:08:58.48 --> 03:09:02.48
My hospital visits were shrunk from five days a week to three.

2707
03:09:02.48 --> 03:09:05.48
But physical therapy was a virtually non-existent.

2708
03:09:05.48 --> 03:09:08.48
The only thing that got me out of bed each day was my hatred for the sheets.

2709
03:09:08.48 --> 03:09:12.48
I did nothing but watch movies play my guitar and drink whiskey.

2710
03:09:12.48 --> 03:09:17.48
Rock bottom is a slower and softer landing than one may think.

2711
03:09:17.48 --> 03:09:21.48
That's why we keep chisling away at the bedrock.

2712
03:09:21.48 --> 03:09:25.48
That's some good writing.

2713
03:09:25.48 --> 03:09:31.48
It's freaking depressing writing, but it's good writing.

2714
03:09:31.48 --> 03:09:35.48
Another good piece of good writing right here.

2715
03:09:35.48 --> 03:09:43.48
If there's such a thing as the Christian's concept of the devil, opioids and alcohol are some of the best tools he employees to capture week and demand.

2716
03:09:43.48 --> 03:09:47.48
The instant euphoria softly whispers, it's lies to the heart.

2717
03:09:47.48 --> 03:09:50.48
There are no problems I cannot solve.

2718
03:09:50.48 --> 03:09:54.48
Addiction snags you at your weakest times like the wolf kills a buffalo.

2719
03:09:54.48 --> 03:10:01.48
The wolf waits until the bison's gate is crippled or the snow is deep enough to entrap him, then he pounces.

2720
03:10:01.48 --> 03:10:09.48
Usually he hamstrings the animal first, then slowly and methodically he nalls away the flesh until his prey expires.

2721
03:10:12.48 --> 03:10:14.48
Fast forward a little bit more.

2722
03:10:14.48 --> 03:10:18.48
When I returned home, it was about noon and I was already an inebriated mess.

2723
03:10:18.48 --> 03:10:21.48
I walked through the door, canes, and bourbon into.

2724
03:10:21.48 --> 03:10:24.48
The smell of whiskey radiated from my pores.

2725
03:10:24.48 --> 03:10:27.48
Hey, Braxton, I have something to tell you my wife said.

2726
03:10:27.48 --> 03:10:30.48
She must be leaving for good this time, I thought.

2727
03:10:30.48 --> 03:10:33.48
She's on emotional this time, it's for real.

2728
03:10:33.48 --> 03:10:34.48
Am I okay with that?

2729
03:10:34.48 --> 03:10:38.48
I've wanted her to leave dozens of times, but am I really okay with it?

2730
03:10:38.48 --> 03:10:39.48
Yeah, I think I am.

2731
03:10:39.48 --> 03:10:41.48
How will her family take it?

2732
03:10:41.48 --> 03:10:44.48
I will remain friends with will I remain friends with her brothers?

2733
03:10:44.48 --> 03:10:45.48
Her dad?

2734
03:10:45.48 --> 03:10:46.48
No.

2735
03:10:46.48 --> 03:10:49.48
Maybe they already know that we fight all the time.

2736
03:10:49.48 --> 03:10:50.48
They must.

2737
03:10:50.48 --> 03:10:53.48
Thoughts swirled about my head.

2738
03:10:53.48 --> 03:10:55.48
I think I'm pregnant, she said.

2739
03:10:55.48 --> 03:10:56.48
What?

2740
03:10:56.48 --> 03:10:57.48
I'm pregnant.

2741
03:10:57.48 --> 03:10:59.48
Aren't you happy about that?

2742
03:10:59.48 --> 03:11:00.48
She said smiling.

2743
03:11:00.48 --> 03:11:01.48
Of course I am.

2744
03:11:01.48 --> 03:11:03.48
I acted as if I were.

2745
03:11:03.48 --> 03:11:05.48
I took another shot of bourbon.

2746
03:11:05.48 --> 03:11:10.48
I wanted to be a father badly god only knows why I wasn't fit to be one.

2747
03:11:10.48 --> 03:11:14.48
Still I was indeed very happy that I may be fulfilling that wish.

2748
03:11:14.48 --> 03:11:16.48
But was this really the best time?

2749
03:11:16.48 --> 03:11:21.48
Was I with the best person for me or the best person for her?

2750
03:11:21.48 --> 03:11:23.48
The answer to both of those questions was clearly no.

2751
03:11:23.48 --> 03:11:26.48
Less than a week before we had been fighting nearly every day.

2752
03:11:26.48 --> 03:11:30.48
We told each other that we hated one another and we meant it.

2753
03:11:30.48 --> 03:11:34.48
Each of us had uttered the word divorce aloud.

2754
03:11:34.48 --> 03:11:46.48
Now we are going to have a baby.

2755
03:11:46.48 --> 03:11:49.48
Check.

2756
03:11:49.48 --> 03:11:52.48
You couldn't predict that when you read it over the envelope, right?

2757
03:11:52.48 --> 03:11:53.48
No.

2758
03:11:53.48 --> 03:11:54.48
No.

2759
03:11:54.48 --> 03:11:55.48
It's uh...

2760
03:11:55.48 --> 03:11:56.48
Yeah.

2761
03:11:56.48 --> 03:11:59.48
It's...

2762
03:11:59.48 --> 03:12:00.48
Yeah.

2763
03:12:00.48 --> 03:12:01.48
Rough man.

2764
03:12:01.48 --> 03:12:02.48
Rough.

2765
03:12:02.48 --> 03:12:03.48
Yeah.

2766
03:12:03.48 --> 03:12:07.48
You guys were married young and then you go through all this.

2767
03:12:07.48 --> 03:12:09.48
Like you said, it's hard...

2768
03:12:09.48 --> 03:12:14.48
What you just said, you know, it's hard to have a good marriage when you're drinking bourbon and you know,

2769
03:12:14.48 --> 03:12:17.48
doing drugs and all that.

2770
03:12:17.48 --> 03:12:20.48
Yeah.

2771
03:12:20.48 --> 03:12:23.48
Yeah, you can't put the blame on her for this.

2772
03:12:23.48 --> 03:12:26.48
That's the way I look at it anyway.

2773
03:12:26.48 --> 03:12:32.48
Well, you know, the cliche answer which is the real one though is that I have my got my daughter out of the deal.

2774
03:12:32.48 --> 03:12:35.48
And she lives with me and wife's great.

2775
03:12:35.48 --> 03:12:39.48
You know, I mean this is now 14 years later.

2776
03:12:39.48 --> 03:12:40.48
Yeah.

2777
03:12:40.48 --> 03:12:44.48
But yeah, it sucked their first stretch.

2778
03:12:44.48 --> 03:12:47.48
And it is...

2779
03:12:47.48 --> 03:12:53.48
It's just really easy to get back down on that whole, especially when you really still don't...

2780
03:12:53.48 --> 03:12:55.48
You still feel like you know how anything to live for.

2781
03:12:55.48 --> 03:13:01.48
You know, it's always say that like gratitude, you really got to cultivate gratitude in your daily life.

2782
03:13:01.48 --> 03:13:05.48
But when I read that part...

2783
03:13:05.48 --> 03:13:10.48
Well, when I read this part where she's actually born and you know, she's healthy.

2784
03:13:10.48 --> 03:13:14.48
And you say it's amazing how much a parent can love a child.

2785
03:13:14.48 --> 03:13:16.48
I already loved her.

2786
03:13:16.48 --> 03:13:17.48
I would have to...

2787
03:13:17.48 --> 03:13:19.48
I would have happily died for her.

2788
03:13:19.48 --> 03:13:22.48
I still would have been that moment as I sat there watching them.

2789
03:13:22.48 --> 03:13:25.48
I realized something was still wrong, not with her with me.

2790
03:13:25.48 --> 03:13:27.48
So like I'm like, okay, cool, here we go.

2791
03:13:27.48 --> 03:13:34.48
We're gonna kind of make it through this.

2792
03:13:34.48 --> 03:13:36.48
You talk about PTSD.

2793
03:13:36.48 --> 03:13:39.48
You bring it up earlier than this.

2794
03:13:39.48 --> 03:13:40.48
But this was the time...

2795
03:13:40.48 --> 03:13:44.48
This is where you started kind of conveying your faults on it.

2796
03:13:44.48 --> 03:13:48.48
You say, I previously mentioned other times when I thought that I may have been afflicted by PTSD.

2797
03:13:48.48 --> 03:13:52.48
Many times my subconscious register to symptom of the disease that I'd read about.

2798
03:13:52.48 --> 03:13:54.48
Or my therapist had mentioned.

2799
03:13:54.48 --> 03:13:58.48
Who could miss the unwelcome memories that in an opportune times?

2800
03:13:58.48 --> 03:14:03.48
Or the neverending need to suppress unprovoked anger or the nightmares or the illogical moments of panic?

2801
03:14:03.48 --> 03:14:06.48
I denied the existence of my illness for many reasons.

2802
03:14:06.48 --> 03:14:10.48
But most important was that I just did not want to be associated with many of the others.

2803
03:14:10.48 --> 03:14:13.48
I had seen it the VA pensions for the disease.

2804
03:14:13.48 --> 03:14:16.48
Or sorry, had received VA pensions for the disease.

2805
03:14:16.48 --> 03:14:20.48
I knew of a guy who had worked in the laundry mat in Iraq.

2806
03:14:20.48 --> 03:14:24.48
He got a rating of 80% disability for PTSD.

2807
03:14:24.48 --> 03:14:26.48
For what experience exactly?

2808
03:14:26.48 --> 03:14:27.48
I wondered.

2809
03:14:27.48 --> 03:14:35.48
Another guy had heard of had been found 100% disabled from the trauma of answering radio transmissions from soldiers in combat.

2810
03:14:35.48 --> 03:14:41.48
How could a person be so soft that they were damaged by the sounds of combat I wondered bitterly?

2811
03:14:41.48 --> 03:14:47.48
During my transition there seemed no less noble and act than claiming to suffer from PTSD.

2812
03:14:47.48 --> 03:14:51.48
It wasn't just that it wasn't just seen as an illness that plagued the week.

2813
03:14:51.48 --> 03:14:57.48
It wasn't many cases an illness claimed by liars, whether they were weak or not was unimportant.

2814
03:14:57.48 --> 03:15:01.48
I had made many mistakes and acted cowardly and lied many times in my life.

2815
03:15:01.48 --> 03:15:06.48
But I had no desire to have those descriptors permanently enshrined in my records.

2816
03:15:06.48 --> 03:15:18.48
At least that was the way I saw it back then.

2817
03:15:18.48 --> 03:15:19.48
Interesting thought.

2818
03:15:19.48 --> 03:15:26.48
It's a very interesting thought that you're having because you're a freaking tough cowboy.

2819
03:15:26.48 --> 03:15:32.48
These guys that are saying they have PTSD because they worked in the laundry mat in Iraq.

2820
03:15:32.48 --> 03:15:36.48
Yeah, right.

2821
03:15:36.48 --> 03:15:39.48
But I wasn't a lot of guys thought that at the time.

2822
03:15:39.48 --> 03:15:42.48
And because it's a lot true to it.

2823
03:15:42.48 --> 03:15:45.48
I mean, dude's really a game that should have that system.

2824
03:15:45.48 --> 03:15:47.48
We all know it.

2825
03:15:47.48 --> 03:15:53.48
I understand that the VA's in a tough position because you know how do you really weed out people out of a game?

2826
03:15:53.48 --> 03:15:54.48
I get it.

2827
03:15:54.48 --> 03:15:58.48
But from the soldiers perspective, I didn't want to be still to this day.

2828
03:15:58.48 --> 03:16:08.48
I want to be labeled in that same way. I come happy to talk about, you know, PTSD and working through stuff and acknowledging that it's definitely had profound impacts on my life.

2829
03:16:08.48 --> 03:16:12.48
And I would like to try to help people through whatever suffering they're having.

2830
03:16:12.48 --> 03:16:15.48
But I don't necessarily want to be associated with it.

2831
03:16:15.48 --> 03:16:19.48
And that's for that same reason today.

2832
03:16:19.48 --> 03:16:24.48
I mean, luckily, you don't have to worry.

2833
03:16:24.48 --> 03:16:29.48
You know, a lot of ways that I don't have to worry about being associated with that crown, this is for obvious reasons.

2834
03:16:29.48 --> 03:16:37.48
But yeah, it's, you know, people talk, especially in the veteran community, we want to destigmatize the term PTSD.

2835
03:16:37.48 --> 03:16:40.48
I don't know.

2836
03:16:40.48 --> 03:16:44.48
I think we need to destigmatize mental health for sure.

2837
03:16:44.48 --> 03:16:48.48
But PTSD sort of took on a life of its own.

2838
03:16:48.48 --> 03:16:55.48
And so like maybe it's time to just shed that label and go with something new or stigmatize it, should I?

2839
03:16:55.48 --> 03:17:00.48
I don't know the right answer.

2840
03:17:00.48 --> 03:17:06.48
I don't know if it ran up.

2841
03:17:06.48 --> 03:17:13.48
As you're working through that shit, you and your wife end up getting divorced.

2842
03:17:13.48 --> 03:17:28.48
And initially you, her and her and your daughter leave for her home, which is like middle of the country, 1300 miles away.

2843
03:17:28.48 --> 03:17:39.48
And then you say, if you thought that the heartache of divorce and the departure of my beloved child would have caused me to take a long hard look at myself, you'd be wrong.

2844
03:17:39.48 --> 03:17:48.48
Because hedonism and self indulgence provide immediate gratification, the Russian excitement and euphoria make it difficult to dig in one's heels and change course.

2845
03:17:48.48 --> 03:17:51.48
And why would you want to change your lifestyle if you've got no respect for your future?

2846
03:17:51.48 --> 03:17:59.48
The simple, perhaps sad truth is of it, is that debotry can be good old plain fun for a while.

2847
03:17:59.48 --> 03:18:05.48
For about seven years, I lived in hell and sometimes I relished in it.

2848
03:18:05.48 --> 03:18:13.48
You basically, you basically went hard for seven years.

2849
03:18:13.48 --> 03:18:19.48
Yeah, I mean, I'd not so much on drugs, but alcohol and party and chasing drills.

2850
03:18:19.48 --> 03:18:23.48
One of those times I've been sending you, actually.

2851
03:18:23.48 --> 03:18:31.48
Yeah, we went out of friends that were a bachelor group and we were all doing okay, making pretty good money and irislike.

2852
03:18:31.48 --> 03:18:39.48
Yeah, the evening's like my descent always started out in an exuberance and ended shamefully.

2853
03:18:39.48 --> 03:18:41.48
I was not myself. I didn't know who I was.

2854
03:18:41.48 --> 03:18:45.48
All I knew is I didn't like the man I saw in the mirror and given the option, I would destroy him.

2855
03:18:45.48 --> 03:18:49.48
My chief mistake was that I didn't realize there was a cure for my illness.

2856
03:18:49.48 --> 03:18:58.48
The truth had I only been willing to accept that I could have been freed of my hide as in jekyll and hide much sooner.

2857
03:18:58.48 --> 03:19:02.48
There were more girls and more parties and I cared to remember.

2858
03:19:02.48 --> 03:19:04.48
Not that I could remember them all if I wanted to.

2859
03:19:04.48 --> 03:19:06.48
My first steps onto the slippery slope were enjoyable.

2860
03:19:06.48 --> 03:19:13.48
It can be great fun to lose control momentarily, but once that on that slope, I couldn't keep myself from creating to the bottom.

2861
03:19:13.48 --> 03:19:16.48
I hardly had control of anything in my life.

2862
03:19:16.48 --> 03:19:18.48
Let alone my alcohol habit.

2863
03:19:18.48 --> 03:19:24.48
I had ripped the moral substrate out from my under my world and descended into nihilism.

2864
03:19:24.48 --> 03:19:28.48
nihilism is not without benefits though it simplifies life.

2865
03:19:28.48 --> 03:19:30.48
There's a problem with nihilism.

2866
03:19:30.48 --> 03:19:34.48
It leads to depravity and uncontrolled chaos.

2867
03:19:34.48 --> 03:19:38.48
If nothing else matters, then that's that.

2868
03:19:38.48 --> 03:19:40.48
Why care about health for the future.

2869
03:19:40.48 --> 03:19:44.48
Unbridled pleasure was the closest thing I could find to happiness.

2870
03:19:44.48 --> 03:19:52.48
I saw only hedonistic satisfaction, which I think is the logical conclusion of nihilistic ideologies.

2871
03:19:52.48 --> 03:20:00.48
It's important to note that my life wasn't all that bad either.

2872
03:20:00.48 --> 03:20:01.48
It rarely is.

2873
03:20:01.48 --> 03:20:04.48
That's what makes it so hard to crawl back up the slope.

2874
03:20:04.48 --> 03:20:07.48
I was still making very realistic, very real physical milestones.

2875
03:20:07.48 --> 03:20:09.48
I had abandoned the cane altogether.

2876
03:20:09.48 --> 03:20:12.48
I still stretched every day and did like workouts.

2877
03:20:12.48 --> 03:20:16.48
My physical body was healing and aside from the infrequent brushes with the law.

2878
03:20:16.48 --> 03:20:18.48
I was having fun.

2879
03:20:18.48 --> 03:20:26.48
The most dreadful part was that somewhere very deep down in my subconscious and the land of all that shadow was the truth.

2880
03:20:26.48 --> 03:20:28.48
It was all my fault.

2881
03:20:28.48 --> 03:20:29.48
War, no war.

2882
03:20:29.48 --> 03:20:33.48
The problems I faced were my own creation and I knew that.

2883
03:20:39.48 --> 03:20:40.48
Yeah.

2884
03:20:40.48 --> 03:20:43.48
I think sometimes we use these things.

2885
03:20:43.48 --> 03:20:53.48
Some people will use these things the way to escape from the shame of knowing that you're not what you could be.

2886
03:20:53.48 --> 03:20:59.48
People talk about potential all the time and no one knows you're potential better than you.

2887
03:20:59.48 --> 03:21:02.48
You know who you really are, way down in there.

2888
03:21:02.48 --> 03:21:04.48
You just come up with distractions.

2889
03:21:04.48 --> 03:21:12.48
You useless and senseless distractions, parties and girls and whatever other venture just to avoid.

2890
03:21:12.48 --> 03:21:15.48
Become what you could be.

2891
03:21:15.48 --> 03:21:18.48
And you said you were making money at this time.

2892
03:21:18.48 --> 03:21:19.48
What were you doing?

2893
03:21:19.48 --> 03:21:23.48
I was working an outreach for a not-for-profit company.

2894
03:21:23.48 --> 03:21:24.48
But you were getting paid.

2895
03:21:24.48 --> 03:21:26.48
They were paying me for you.

2896
03:21:26.48 --> 03:21:31.48
And then at some point you kind of realized.

2897
03:21:31.48 --> 03:21:33.48
My life was falling apart.

2898
03:21:33.48 --> 03:21:36.48
My credit score was taking my job was on the rocks.

2899
03:21:36.48 --> 03:21:41.48
Every close relationship I had once depended on was virtually demolished.

2900
03:21:41.48 --> 03:21:43.48
I was having too much fun to see it.

2901
03:21:43.48 --> 03:21:45.48
You decided you quit your job.

2902
03:21:45.48 --> 03:21:47.48
Yeah.

2903
03:21:47.48 --> 03:21:48.48
There was an end.

2904
03:21:48.48 --> 03:21:50.48
And you wrote about that in here.

2905
03:21:50.48 --> 03:21:53.48
It's an interesting, basically.

2906
03:21:53.48 --> 03:21:58.48
There was like an integrity issue with the place you were working for.

2907
03:21:58.48 --> 03:22:03.48
And you, at one point, you're talking to a metal of honor recipient.

2908
03:22:03.48 --> 03:22:06.48
And you just couldn't lie to him basically.

2909
03:22:06.48 --> 03:22:11.48
Like, all of those are just such an obvious flat out bullshit lie.

2910
03:22:11.48 --> 03:22:12.48
Like straight up.

2911
03:22:12.48 --> 03:22:15.48
And not like one of these white lies or stretches.

2912
03:22:15.48 --> 03:22:21.48
It was just a straight up fall suit at the expense of other veterans.

2913
03:22:21.48 --> 03:22:24.48
And this, you know, trying to fundraise essentially.

2914
03:22:24.48 --> 03:22:27.48
You know, like the lie was attempt to raise more funds.

2915
03:22:27.48 --> 03:22:29.48
And so yeah, I quit it.

2916
03:22:29.48 --> 03:22:30.48
And you quit.

2917
03:22:30.48 --> 03:22:31.48
So you quit your job.

2918
03:22:31.48 --> 03:22:34.48
You still have, I mean, obviously you're getting your disability pay.

2919
03:22:34.48 --> 03:22:35.48
And did you get medically retired?

2920
03:22:35.48 --> 03:22:37.48
You don't get both of them.

2921
03:22:37.48 --> 03:22:39.48
Oh, you only get one.

2922
03:22:39.48 --> 03:22:40.48
Mm-hmm.

2923
03:22:40.48 --> 03:22:41.48
Yeah.

2924
03:22:41.48 --> 03:22:43.48
But at least that was enough money to survive on.

2925
03:22:43.48 --> 03:22:45.48
Yeah, especially in Caltown, Utah.

2926
03:22:45.48 --> 03:22:49.48
Man, my freaking mortgage is like seven hundred bucks.

2927
03:22:49.48 --> 03:22:51.48
I was doing five.

2928
03:22:51.48 --> 03:22:53.48
So you quit that job.

2929
03:22:53.48 --> 03:22:55.48
And you want to talk about unexpected.

2930
03:22:55.48 --> 03:22:57.48
Didn't see that common was, uh,

2931
03:22:57.48 --> 03:23:00.48
I don't know.

2932
03:23:00.48 --> 03:23:01.48
What?

2933
03:23:01.48 --> 03:23:05.48
What?

2934
03:23:05.48 --> 03:23:06.48
Comedian.

2935
03:23:06.48 --> 03:23:07.48
Yeah.

2936
03:23:07.48 --> 03:23:08.48
Yeah.

2937
03:23:08.48 --> 03:23:11.48
Like I was going to college and I was like, I'm always won't try that.

2938
03:23:11.48 --> 03:23:13.48
So I started doing it.

2939
03:23:13.48 --> 03:23:15.48
And you must have done all right.

2940
03:23:15.48 --> 03:23:16.48
You did it for a while.

2941
03:23:16.48 --> 03:23:17.48
I mean, it's still Utah.

2942
03:23:17.48 --> 03:23:18.48
Even Salt Lake.

2943
03:23:18.48 --> 03:23:19.48
It's like,

2944
03:23:19.48 --> 03:23:20.48
It's so.

2945
03:23:20.48 --> 03:23:24.48
Yeah, I did it for a big fish in the small pond and you talk comedy scene.

2946
03:23:24.48 --> 03:23:28.48
I'm medium-sized fish and a very small pond.

2947
03:23:28.48 --> 03:23:29.48
Um,

2948
03:23:29.48 --> 03:23:31.48
Yeah, I mean, we did okay.

2949
03:23:31.48 --> 03:23:33.48
And I got to be buddies with a guy that was really good.

2950
03:23:33.48 --> 03:23:35.48
And so that helped, you know, I mean, I was terrible.

2951
03:23:35.48 --> 03:23:38.48
I get everyone who's, but I got to, you know,

2952
03:23:38.48 --> 03:23:39.48
I get it.

2953
03:23:39.48 --> 03:23:40.48
It was fun.

2954
03:23:40.48 --> 03:23:41.48
I did enjoy it.

2955
03:23:41.48 --> 03:23:43.48
Um, but it, you know, looking back,

2956
03:23:43.48 --> 03:23:50.48
even, even the jokes I would write and stuff were reflective of why I could different person that I'd ever been.

2957
03:23:50.48 --> 03:23:51.48
Because I was like,

2958
03:23:51.48 --> 03:23:57.48
and especially like as a young open micer and then you progress like a middle act and stuff here,

2959
03:23:57.48 --> 03:23:59.48
you're just really reaching for stuff.

2960
03:23:59.48 --> 03:24:02.48
And so you're just saying horrific shit sometimes.

2961
03:24:02.48 --> 03:24:03.48
Just like shock value.

2962
03:24:03.48 --> 03:24:04.48
Yeah.

2963
03:24:04.48 --> 03:24:07.48
And I look back at some of that stuff and I can poorly embarrass by it.

2964
03:24:07.48 --> 03:24:09.48
You think you're going to take a crack at it again.

2965
03:24:09.48 --> 03:24:11.48
Come out of it tirelessly.

2966
03:24:11.48 --> 03:24:13.48
I live in Central Idaho.

2967
03:24:13.48 --> 03:24:17.48
Just go post up at the bar and I know falls or something.

2968
03:24:17.48 --> 03:24:18.48
I guess.

2969
03:24:20.48 --> 03:24:22.48
Look, you're making us laugh, man.

2970
03:24:22.48 --> 03:24:23.48
You know, you got it.

2971
03:24:23.48 --> 03:24:24.48
You still got it.

2972
03:24:24.48 --> 03:24:34.48
One of the best things that happened was you actually ended up meeting a girl.

2973
03:24:34.48 --> 03:24:38.48
And the girl that you meet, uh, she has a son.

2974
03:24:38.48 --> 03:24:40.48
Who was a few years older than your daughter,

2975
03:24:40.48 --> 03:24:44.48
but you, but he's like playing baseball.

2976
03:24:44.48 --> 03:24:48.48
And you didn't think that the baseball was really getting him what he needed.

2977
03:24:48.48 --> 03:24:50.48
So you signed him up for wrestling.

2978
03:24:50.48 --> 03:24:57.48
And it turned out that his wrestling coach was your communications professor in college.

2979
03:24:57.48 --> 03:25:00.48
You know, and he knew who you were as a wrestler.

2980
03:25:00.48 --> 03:25:01.48
Is that right?

2981
03:25:01.48 --> 03:25:01.48
Yeah.

2982
03:25:01.48 --> 03:25:04.48
Well, and then I coached a miller for a while after the I was in this in college.

2983
03:25:04.48 --> 03:25:05.48
Oh, okay.

2984
03:25:05.48 --> 03:25:07.48
So he knew you had a wrestling background.

2985
03:25:07.48 --> 03:25:09.48
So he basically said, hey, if you don't freaking coach wrestling,

2986
03:25:09.48 --> 03:25:10.48
it's going to hurt your head.

2987
03:25:10.48 --> 03:25:11.48
Yeah, he straight up.

2988
03:25:11.48 --> 03:25:12.48
He straight up.

2989
03:25:12.48 --> 03:25:13.48
He straight up.

2990
03:25:13.48 --> 03:25:14.48
Yeah.

2991
03:25:14.48 --> 03:25:19.48
So you, you start coaching and as your coaching him,

2992
03:25:19.48 --> 03:25:21.48
wrestling, he's his end, he's his end.

2993
03:25:21.48 --> 03:25:22.48
He's his end.

2994
03:25:22.48 --> 03:25:23.48
He's going into baseball.

2995
03:25:23.48 --> 03:25:27.48
So you decide you're going to coach baseball too.

2996
03:25:27.48 --> 03:25:29.48
Um, and then this happens.

2997
03:25:29.48 --> 03:25:30.48
This is pretty cool.

2998
03:25:30.48 --> 03:25:31.48
I flipped the pitch.

2999
03:25:31.48 --> 03:25:32.48
So you're coaching these little kids.

3000
03:25:32.48 --> 03:25:34.48
I flipped a pitch to the little batter.

3001
03:25:34.48 --> 03:25:36.48
He softly hit, uh, it softly in the air.

3002
03:25:36.48 --> 03:25:38.48
I lightly trotted to it and reel it in.

3003
03:25:38.48 --> 03:25:39.48
Another pitch.

3004
03:25:39.48 --> 03:25:42.48
He hit a hard ground ball, a step to my right.

3005
03:25:42.48 --> 03:25:43.48
I field it with ease.

3006
03:25:43.48 --> 03:25:45.48
Somewhere in my subconscious,

3007
03:25:45.48 --> 03:25:47.48
the thought rang, dang, that felt good.

3008
03:25:47.48 --> 03:25:49.48
I served him another this time.

3009
03:25:49.48 --> 03:25:52.48
He hit a hard ground ball about three steps to my left.

3010
03:25:52.48 --> 03:25:53.48
My glove hand side.

3011
03:25:53.48 --> 03:25:57.48
I sprinted to it and scooped it up with a spinning motion.

3012
03:25:57.48 --> 03:26:00.48
A smile is wide and as Montana creased my face,

3013
03:26:00.48 --> 03:26:01.48
holy crap.

3014
03:26:01.48 --> 03:26:03.48
You just ran his mother shouted, I know.

3015
03:26:03.48 --> 03:26:05.48
I couldn't contain my excitement.

3016
03:26:05.48 --> 03:26:07.48
I started charging it every ball he hit,

3017
03:26:07.48 --> 03:26:08.48
even the ones I didn't need to.

3018
03:26:08.48 --> 03:26:10.48
A rush of love filled me.

3019
03:26:10.48 --> 03:26:13.48
I'd forgotten how good it felt to be somewhat capable.

3020
03:26:13.48 --> 03:26:15.48
And likely never would have run toward a ball

3021
03:26:15.48 --> 03:26:17.48
if I hadn't been tired and losing focus.

3022
03:26:17.48 --> 03:26:20.48
The lack of attention allowed my subconscious mind

3023
03:26:20.48 --> 03:26:21.48
to unshackle the chains.

3024
03:26:21.48 --> 03:26:25.48
My conscious mind bound my legs with.

3025
03:26:25.48 --> 03:26:28.48
On the next pitch, he ripped the line drive over my head.

3026
03:26:28.48 --> 03:26:29.48
I tried to jump for it.

3027
03:26:29.48 --> 03:26:30.48
Nope. Still can't jump.

3028
03:26:30.48 --> 03:26:33.48
Well, I guess basketball's out of the question.

3029
03:26:33.48 --> 03:26:35.48
I yelled grinning widely.

3030
03:26:35.48 --> 03:26:39.48
We called it quits and I immediately grabbed my phone

3031
03:26:39.48 --> 03:26:41.48
out of my ball bag.

3032
03:26:41.48 --> 03:26:43.48
I sent out several text messages that read,

3033
03:26:43.48 --> 03:26:46.48
read, read, I just ran in all caps.

3034
03:26:46.48 --> 03:26:48.48
A few war buddies who received it called me

3035
03:26:48.48 --> 03:26:50.48
later that night demanding to hear the full story.

3036
03:26:50.48 --> 03:26:53.48
When I reiterated it to them, he cried.

3037
03:26:53.48 --> 03:26:58.48
Pretty awesome discovery right there.

3038
03:26:58.48 --> 03:27:01.48
It really was.

3039
03:27:01.48 --> 03:27:04.48
Yeah, I wonder how much sooner I would have figured that out.

3040
03:27:04.48 --> 03:27:07.48
I felt I wasn't screaming everything else up.

3041
03:27:07.48 --> 03:27:11.48
You know, if I had just been dedicated to working on my body,

3042
03:27:11.48 --> 03:27:14.48
I could probably have had five years that I lost.

3043
03:27:14.48 --> 03:27:17.48
You know, partying.

3044
03:27:22.48 --> 03:27:26.48
Near the end of his baseball season in about 4 p.m.

3045
03:27:26.48 --> 03:27:29.48
Got a message.

3046
03:27:29.48 --> 03:27:31.48
Grandpa was just rushed to the hospital by ambulance

3047
03:27:31.48 --> 03:27:35.48
read a text from my mother that would alter the my course forever.

3048
03:27:35.48 --> 03:27:38.48
I called her on the phone to get the details and comfort her.

3049
03:27:38.48 --> 03:27:41.48
If there was some way that I could, she was clearly anguishing.

3050
03:27:41.48 --> 03:27:45.48
What can a son say to a mother who's witnessing her rock wash away?

3051
03:27:48.48 --> 03:27:51.48
That night sitting on the balcony of my apartment in West Jordan,

3052
03:27:51.48 --> 03:27:54.48
Utah, staring at my tomato plants, I wondered what I would do

3053
03:27:54.48 --> 03:27:55.48
in a world without him.

3054
03:27:55.48 --> 03:27:58.48
I wish to be away from the bright lights and noise of the city

3055
03:27:58.48 --> 03:28:02.48
sitting by a morning camp fire drinking coffee with him again.

3056
03:28:02.48 --> 03:28:05.48
I knew I'd long since begun to rediscover myself,

3057
03:28:05.48 --> 03:28:08.48
but could I stay properly aimed without him.

3058
03:28:08.48 --> 03:28:10.48
I had started hunting and fishing again.

3059
03:28:10.48 --> 03:28:12.48
I went back to my roots.

3060
03:28:12.48 --> 03:28:16.48
I read a little young, became,

3061
03:28:16.48 --> 03:28:20.48
and became convinced of the importance of symbols,

3062
03:28:20.48 --> 03:28:24.48
not just in a sociocultural sense, but personally,

3063
03:28:24.48 --> 03:28:29.48
I'd begun to wear my cowboy hat and public instead of only on the weekends

3064
03:28:29.48 --> 03:28:32.48
when I was away from the prime eyes of all muckers.

3065
03:28:32.48 --> 03:28:35.48
Still, though this was a positive step backward,

3066
03:28:35.48 --> 03:28:39.48
I had not truly returned home yet.

3067
03:28:39.48 --> 03:28:42.48
And I didn't know exactly what that meant.

3068
03:28:42.48 --> 03:28:44.48
I only knew that they answered,

3069
03:28:44.48 --> 03:28:47.48
lay somewhere in my history, somewhere in my roots.

3070
03:28:47.48 --> 03:28:51.48
I think of it as true that clothing does not make the man,

3071
03:28:51.48 --> 03:28:54.48
but it is a display of what it is inside the heart.

3072
03:28:54.48 --> 03:28:57.48
A cowboy hat may have been a trivial thing,

3073
03:28:57.48 --> 03:28:59.48
but before I had descended to the underworld,

3074
03:28:59.48 --> 03:29:01.48
I had worn it with pride.

3075
03:29:01.48 --> 03:29:03.48
I had never seen a symbol of honor, hard work,

3076
03:29:03.48 --> 03:29:05.48
and respect of heritage.

3077
03:29:05.48 --> 03:29:07.48
It had been so closely attached to that symbol

3078
03:29:07.48 --> 03:29:11.48
that I'd worn one nearly every second of my life before I strayed.

3079
03:29:11.48 --> 03:29:14.48
As a boy, it was no strange event for my mom to remove a hat

3080
03:29:14.48 --> 03:29:16.48
from my head as I slept.

3081
03:29:16.48 --> 03:29:19.48
My hat was the first thing my ex-wife brought to me

3082
03:29:19.48 --> 03:29:21.48
when I was in a Walter Reed recovering.

3083
03:29:21.48 --> 03:29:23.48
I wore it nearly all the time after that.

3084
03:29:23.48 --> 03:29:25.48
It was not a fast and statement,

3085
03:29:25.48 --> 03:29:28.48
but a symbol of all my grandpa believed in.

3086
03:29:28.48 --> 03:29:32.48
I thought about all that my grandfather taught me as a boy.

3087
03:29:32.48 --> 03:29:36.48
He thought there were concrete skills and lessons required of a man

3088
03:29:36.48 --> 03:29:38.48
from the west,

3089
03:29:38.48 --> 03:29:41.48
and he made damn sure that I learned them.

3090
03:29:41.48 --> 03:29:46.48
And in your footnotes, you say, by the west, you mean the Rocky Mountain west.

3091
03:29:46.48 --> 03:29:50.48
I remembered his knuckles pressing into mountain mud

3092
03:29:50.48 --> 03:29:53.48
to show me how a mature, mule deer bucks weight

3093
03:29:53.48 --> 03:29:56.48
causes depressions much different than a young buck or do does.

3094
03:29:56.48 --> 03:29:59.48
He showed me how to read the difference between an elk track that had just

3095
03:29:59.48 --> 03:30:03.48
slid down a wet muddy hillside and one who was on a dead run.

3096
03:30:03.48 --> 03:30:07.48
He tied his own flies for catching trout out of our mountain creeks, rivers and lakes,

3097
03:30:07.48 --> 03:30:11.48
all of which were different flies and weights of flies by his estimation.

3098
03:30:11.48 --> 03:30:13.48
And he made sure I could do that too.

3099
03:30:13.48 --> 03:30:18.48
He taught me how to skin an animal by showing me how he did it.

3100
03:30:18.48 --> 03:30:23.48
But he only let me practice on the lower legs of elk and deer he killed.

3101
03:30:23.48 --> 03:30:26.48
He taught me how to trap and clean fish and game.

3102
03:30:26.48 --> 03:30:30.48
He spent time on more abstract things like what it really means to be a man.

3103
03:30:30.48 --> 03:30:34.48
That's a much harder concept to pin down on page.

3104
03:30:34.48 --> 03:30:40.48
On one deer hunt, when I was about 10 years old, he handed me a raw liver from a buck he had just killed.

3105
03:30:40.48 --> 03:30:46.48
He told me that taking a large bite of it was the only real right of passage to manhood.

3106
03:30:46.48 --> 03:30:51.48
When the metallic tasting fleshy substance filled the entirety of my mouth

3107
03:30:51.48 --> 03:30:57.48
and thick warm blood, round down my cheeks and neck, he let out a deep belly laugh.

3108
03:30:57.48 --> 03:31:02.48
I realized the joke was on me. He was trying to teach me two lessons there.

3109
03:31:02.48 --> 03:31:09.48
One that no single physical act makes a man and two, not everything in a authority figure tells you his worth believing.

3110
03:31:09.48 --> 03:31:13.48
Sometimes you're just the butt of a joke.

3111
03:31:13.48 --> 03:31:17.48
You say that the positive step backward,

3112
03:31:17.48 --> 03:31:21.48
normally we think step backward, we think of a negative connotation.

3113
03:31:21.48 --> 03:31:27.48
But for you, the cowboy hat was going back to your roots in a positive way.

3114
03:31:27.48 --> 03:31:32.48
And not all progress is progress.

3115
03:31:32.48 --> 03:31:36.48
It's a good note.

3116
03:31:36.48 --> 03:31:42.48
A couple days later, my girlfriend and I were back in my hometown at the church where his funeral would be held.

3117
03:31:42.48 --> 03:31:47.48
The hallways were lined with pictures of him and my grandma and love of his life and his best friend.

3118
03:31:47.48 --> 03:31:50.48
He believed that family was the most important thing in life.

3119
03:31:50.48 --> 03:31:55.48
There were dozens of pictures of him and his brothers, his kids and his grandchildren approve it.

3120
03:31:55.48 --> 03:32:00.48
Table sat on the other side of the doors to the chapel where his service would be held.

3121
03:32:00.48 --> 03:32:08.48
Each was decorated with his prized belongings, his flyfishing pole, flies that he had tied and his hunting knife.

3122
03:32:08.48 --> 03:32:15.48
On one table, a top Iraq that held his re-curve bow and leather quiver filled with wooden arrows,

3123
03:32:15.48 --> 03:32:19.48
rested his brown cowboy hat.

3124
03:32:19.48 --> 03:32:24.48
If it is true that you can tell the character of a man by the company he keeps,

3125
03:32:24.48 --> 03:32:32.48
then I think it equally true that you can tell the type of man by the possessions his company believes he values.

3126
03:32:32.48 --> 03:32:36.48
I stood staring at the hat for a while.

3127
03:32:36.48 --> 03:32:40.48
I remembered asking him if I could wear it around our deer camp when I was a young boy.

3128
03:32:40.48 --> 03:32:43.48
He dropped it on my head and smiled.

3129
03:32:43.48 --> 03:32:51.48
I spent the rest of the afternoon walking around with that hat like I was like it was a crown fit for the king of kings.

3130
03:32:51.48 --> 03:32:59.48
My great uncle John, grandpa's younger brother, came up to us while I was daydreaming and asked how I was doing.

3131
03:32:59.48 --> 03:33:06.48
John was a combat controller and Vietnam. He had seen more than his share of fighting.

3132
03:33:06.48 --> 03:33:12.48
I knew intuitively that the question was meant to get it something deeper than how I felt that present.

3133
03:33:12.48 --> 03:33:19.48
I answered it honestly, getting better, I think, I said, how long have you been back now?

3134
03:33:19.48 --> 03:33:24.48
About seven years or so, give it ten and you will be fine, he said.

3135
03:33:24.48 --> 03:33:30.48
You may be a mess for those ten years but you'll be okay after that. It will always be there.

3136
03:33:30.48 --> 03:33:37.48
It doesn't go away but one day, all of a sudden you'll have it under control.

3137
03:33:37.48 --> 03:33:42.48
Okay, thank you.

3138
03:33:42.48 --> 03:33:48.48
The host called the children and grandchildren up to the casket to pay final respects.

3139
03:33:48.48 --> 03:33:54.48
But luckily, I walked up and put my arm around my mother. She was sobbing uncontrollably.

3140
03:33:54.48 --> 03:34:00.48
Between gas for air, she whispered, aren't you going to say goodbye?

3141
03:34:00.48 --> 03:34:06.48
No, I'd rather this not be the last image I remember him by.

3142
03:34:06.48 --> 03:34:10.48
She grabbed my hand and dragged me up to his body.

3143
03:34:10.48 --> 03:34:20.48
Up until that point, I had hardly shed a tear. Grandpa taught me that men ought not to cry anyway.

3144
03:34:20.48 --> 03:34:23.48
I tried to keep my composure.

3145
03:34:23.48 --> 03:34:30.48
When I saw him lying there, hair combed perfectly, body dressed in his Sunday best.

3146
03:34:30.48 --> 03:34:36.48
I broke down in a way I never have before or since.

3147
03:34:36.48 --> 03:34:43.48
The flood of grief and despair twisted my face. I felt like I had been struck by an avalanche of emotion.

3148
03:34:43.48 --> 03:34:50.48
It seemed as if every little bit of anguish I had collected throughout my lifetime, welled up at once.

3149
03:34:50.48 --> 03:34:55.48
I raised my black cowboy hat up to cover my face and wept.

3150
03:34:55.48 --> 03:34:59.48
This was a different kind of pain than I had felt before.

3151
03:34:59.48 --> 03:35:08.48
The kind that a person only encounters when he knows he had failed another that he loved and revered.

3152
03:35:08.48 --> 03:35:17.48
For years after returning home from the war, I had lived less than two blocks away from Grandpa and Grandma, but I seldom visited them.

3153
03:35:17.48 --> 03:35:28.48
When my mother asked me why I wasn't going to see my grandpa when I more often, I always gave the same selfish pathetic excuse.

3154
03:35:28.48 --> 03:35:32.48
It's just too hard for me to see my hero withering away in a bed.

3155
03:35:32.48 --> 03:35:36.48
I don't want to remember him like this.

3156
03:35:36.48 --> 03:35:41.48
I think the full gravity of my selfishness hit me at that moment.

3157
03:35:41.48 --> 03:35:45.48
It should never have been about me.

3158
03:35:45.48 --> 03:35:48.48
What an ignorant wretch I was.

3159
03:35:48.48 --> 03:35:54.48
As for the excuse that I had been using to avoid the situation, that was only half true anyway.

3160
03:35:54.48 --> 03:36:00.48
The whole truth was, yes, it was hard to seem like that, but I was running from everything in my life after the war.

3161
03:36:00.48 --> 03:36:07.48
I was running from my emotions, from my responsibilities as a man, and from my own mind.

3162
03:36:07.48 --> 03:36:14.48
My mistakes as happens to all of us when we fail were too often thrust onto other people I loved most around me.

3163
03:36:14.48 --> 03:36:19.48
Sure, I was paying for them too, but so were they.

3164
03:36:19.48 --> 03:36:23.48
And they had done nothing to deserve it.

3165
03:36:23.48 --> 03:36:27.48
I failed a man that I loved more than life itself.

3166
03:36:27.48 --> 03:36:36.48
My selfishness had hurt him when he needed me most, and it was too late to make up for it.

3167
03:36:36.48 --> 03:37:05.48
All I could do is weep, and that's all I did.

3168
03:37:05.48 --> 03:37:18.48
Well, it does seem like these moments throughout the book that when you read them, you think,

3169
03:37:18.48 --> 03:37:29.48
this is the one that's going to get you up on step, and get you transition away from this negative path.

3170
03:37:29.48 --> 03:37:38.48
And it certainly seems like this one had a big impact.

3171
03:37:38.48 --> 03:37:49.48
Yeah, definitely wish you could see him over at now.

3172
03:37:49.48 --> 03:37:54.48
Well, I wish you could have seen you when you walked into my gym today.

3173
03:37:54.48 --> 03:37:58.48
Down here in Southern California in San Diego, Sport and a cowboy.

3174
03:37:58.48 --> 03:38:01.48
I'm sure he'd be hell of proud.

3175
03:38:01.48 --> 03:38:08.48
Yeah, and he loved his grandkids, and I wish he could see my kids, you know.

3176
03:38:08.48 --> 03:38:12.48
So good life is now.

3177
03:38:12.48 --> 03:38:20.48
I was so I can't, you know, I can't go back and be there for him when I should have been.

3178
03:38:20.48 --> 03:38:27.48
Well, one thing that is another thing that's positive is someone sitting here listening right to this right now.

3179
03:38:27.48 --> 03:38:30.48
I guarantee, at least one person.

3180
03:38:30.48 --> 03:38:39.48
I don't know how many, but I know at least a minimum of one is going to make that move and go and spend time with people they care about that they should.

3181
03:38:39.48 --> 03:38:43.48
Oh, so.

3182
03:38:43.48 --> 03:38:51.48
That lesson that you learned now gets passed on.

3183
03:38:51.48 --> 03:39:07.48
As you, as you go through that, you start to realize that you missed what the various things that you missed about being in the military, the various things you missed about being in combat specifically.

3184
03:39:07.48 --> 03:39:18.48
And you realized you missed even training and getting ready and preparing, which are really positive things in life.

3185
03:39:18.48 --> 03:39:24.48
Um, you say, you say in the book, I miss training.

3186
03:39:24.48 --> 03:39:28.48
I love the feeling of conquering a particularly difficult day at work.

3187
03:39:28.48 --> 03:39:34.48
The kind of satisfaction that one only gets when he thinks it improbable to overcome the challenge before he begins.

3188
03:39:34.48 --> 03:39:36.48
That reminded me, I did run a while back.

3189
03:39:36.48 --> 03:39:38.48
Maybe I can run a full mile now.

3190
03:39:38.48 --> 03:39:41.48
I decided to call up my old friend in first line leader Johnny.

3191
03:39:41.48 --> 03:39:45.48
I knew he had been running marifons and triathlon since he returned from Iraq.

3192
03:39:45.48 --> 03:39:50.48
Surely he would love to be there when I ran my first mile since the suicide bombing crippled me.

3193
03:39:50.48 --> 03:39:51.48
I called him up.

3194
03:39:51.48 --> 03:39:53.48
Hey, bro, I want to run a mile.

3195
03:39:53.48 --> 03:40:00.48
You, you, you, say you go out.

3196
03:40:00.48 --> 03:40:04.48
You do it.

3197
03:40:04.48 --> 03:40:07.48
We finish the mile loop in about seven minutes and thirty seconds.

3198
03:40:07.48 --> 03:40:11.48
I was proud of my pace, but something else struck me after we finished my ego was the problem.

3199
03:40:11.48 --> 03:40:16.48
I discovered that I was the root of most of my psychological problems years before this.

3200
03:40:16.48 --> 03:40:18.48
And I had taken some measures to get better.

3201
03:40:18.48 --> 03:40:22.48
What I hadn't realized was the role ego was playing in all my suffering.

3202
03:40:22.48 --> 03:40:26.48
I started to look back at every illidvised decision I had ever made.

3203
03:40:26.48 --> 03:40:30.48
Every argument I'd ever been in and the grudge against the army that I had held.

3204
03:40:30.48 --> 03:40:36.48
Nearly all of them could be traced back to my ego.

3205
03:40:36.48 --> 03:40:39.48
And you, you, you, you talk about those.

3206
03:40:39.48 --> 03:40:46.48
I mean, just like the, the, an example is your piss at the army didn't keep you in.

3207
03:40:46.48 --> 03:40:50.48
And yet you say in the book, you're like, hey, I wasn't capable.

3208
03:40:50.48 --> 03:40:53.48
I couldn't freaking, you know, like, carry a rock.

3209
03:40:53.48 --> 03:40:55.48
I couldn't shoot a gun right now.

3210
03:40:55.48 --> 03:40:57.48
How are they going to keep me in?

3211
03:40:57.48 --> 03:41:01.48
But in your mind, your ego was like, they should've kept me in.

3212
03:41:01.48 --> 03:41:04.48
Yeah, yeah, I mean, how stupid can you possibly be?

3213
03:41:04.48 --> 03:41:08.48
But I, you know, I don't know what I thought.

3214
03:41:08.48 --> 03:41:11.48
I was pissing around.

3215
03:41:11.48 --> 03:41:14.48
Yeah, I mean, you're right.

3216
03:41:14.48 --> 03:41:22.48
And it, it's, and I think it's really easy to, and it is a hundred percent of your ego.

3217
03:41:22.48 --> 03:41:27.48
But it's really easy to start doing that thing where you're like, well, do you know how I'm just treats me like a number?

3218
03:41:27.48 --> 03:41:28.48
And all the stuff.

3219
03:41:28.48 --> 03:41:32.48
And I was like, well, yeah, man, they got like a half a million people who they got to grow.

3220
03:41:32.48 --> 03:41:34.48
I could go, what do you want to write you a letter?

3221
03:41:34.48 --> 03:41:38.48
Like, like, what, yeah.

3222
03:41:38.48 --> 03:41:41.48
But yeah, I really, it, it is everything is ego.

3223
03:41:41.48 --> 03:41:44.48
Even still the day when I screw something up, which is, you know, a daily occurrence.

3224
03:41:44.48 --> 03:41:47.48
It's almost every time I only go, like, almost every time.

3225
03:41:47.48 --> 03:41:49.48
Yesterday, I got pissed at something.

3226
03:41:49.48 --> 03:41:51.48
I don't even remember what it was now.

3227
03:41:51.48 --> 03:41:53.48
I remember about a half hour later.

3228
03:41:53.48 --> 03:41:54.48
I was like, yeah, that was me.

3229
03:41:54.48 --> 03:41:55.48
That was me too, but I'm fine.

3230
03:41:55.48 --> 03:41:56.48
I'm fine.

3231
03:41:56.48 --> 03:41:57.48
I'm fine.

3232
03:41:57.48 --> 03:41:58.48
The path is not easy.

3233
03:41:58.48 --> 03:42:02.48
The path is not easy path.

3234
03:42:02.48 --> 03:42:06.48
I'm losing my wife's birthday today.

3235
03:42:06.48 --> 03:42:07.48
Oh.

3236
03:42:07.48 --> 03:42:09.48
And she's overseas right now.

3237
03:42:09.48 --> 03:42:13.48
And I like woke up in the morning, so she's in a different time zone, right?

3238
03:42:13.48 --> 03:42:17.48
I woke up in the morning and like, I got shit to do, right?

3239
03:42:17.48 --> 03:42:18.48
You know what I'm saying?

3240
03:42:18.48 --> 03:42:21.48
I got a bigger call, I got work up, work out.

3241
03:42:21.48 --> 03:42:25.48
So I wake up and there's a family group text.

3242
03:42:25.48 --> 03:42:29.48
And it says, you know, happy birthday.

3243
03:42:29.48 --> 03:42:34.48
It's from my daughter that's overseas with my, with my, with my, you know, happy birthday mom.

3244
03:42:34.48 --> 03:42:35.48
Group family group text.

3245
03:42:35.48 --> 03:42:40.48
And I'm like, okay, cool, you know, I'm cool, but I, you know, I'm not going to like,

3246
03:42:40.48 --> 03:42:43.48
I didn't text at that moment in time, right?

3247
03:42:43.48 --> 03:42:50.48
So I wake up, work out, you know, do my morning stuff, go for a run.

3248
03:42:50.48 --> 03:42:51.48
I spath, right?

3249
03:42:51.48 --> 03:42:53.48
Do it the whole nine yards.

3250
03:42:53.48 --> 03:42:58.48
And I look at my text and there's a text off the family group text.

3251
03:42:58.48 --> 03:43:01.48
Only from my wife.

3252
03:43:01.48 --> 03:43:02.48
Oh boy.

3253
03:43:02.48 --> 03:43:04.48
It says, thanks for the birthday text today.

3254
03:43:04.48 --> 03:43:07.48
Yeah, he deserve to be really good.

3255
03:43:07.48 --> 03:43:10.48
That's not the end of the story, but.

3256
03:43:10.48 --> 03:43:13.48
So in my mind, I was like, oh, that's interesting.

3257
03:43:13.48 --> 03:43:16.48
I was kind of sort of a little bit surprised and I was like, and here's the funny thing.

3258
03:43:16.48 --> 03:43:21.48
So in my mind, I was like, I just got home from a trip from a work trip.

3259
03:43:21.48 --> 03:43:23.48
I was gone for four days.

3260
03:43:23.48 --> 03:43:27.48
I worked, how many hours a day do my work at the master?

3261
03:43:27.48 --> 03:43:30.48
16 hours a day at the master.

3262
03:43:30.48 --> 03:43:33.48
Just constantly on the go talking to people shaking hands,

3263
03:43:33.48 --> 03:43:35.48
but that's delivering up on the stage,

3264
03:43:35.48 --> 03:43:38.48
doing all this stuff, get home from that.

3265
03:43:38.48 --> 03:43:40.48
I got to finish reading your book,

3266
03:43:40.48 --> 03:43:42.48
Braxton, then it's Father's Day.

3267
03:43:42.48 --> 03:43:43.48
What do I do on Father's Day?

3268
03:43:43.48 --> 03:43:45.48
Prep this podcast.

3269
03:43:45.48 --> 03:43:47.48
So that's what I'm doing on Father's Day.

3270
03:43:47.48 --> 03:43:50.48
And then I wake up, I got, I know I got a record this day.

3271
03:43:50.48 --> 03:43:53.48
I had another call, a big call in the morning.

3272
03:43:53.48 --> 03:43:56.48
And now I'm thinking my wife is like, text me like, oh, you know,

3273
03:43:56.48 --> 03:43:58.48
she's on vacation.

3274
03:43:58.48 --> 03:44:01.48
But you know what?

3275
03:44:01.48 --> 03:44:03.48
I was like, you know what?

3276
03:44:03.48 --> 03:44:06.48
Just I'm just going to, you know,

3277
03:44:06.48 --> 03:44:08.48
what's his texture and say, hey, you know, sorry about that.

3278
03:44:08.48 --> 03:44:11.48
I was, you know, and then before I could even respond,

3279
03:44:11.48 --> 03:44:13.48
because I was going to sit on it for a little while,

3280
03:44:13.48 --> 03:44:15.48
breathe, you know, take a breath.

3281
03:44:15.48 --> 03:44:18.48
Then my wife sends me a text on the,

3282
03:44:18.48 --> 03:44:21.48
not the family group text, just hers.

3283
03:44:21.48 --> 03:44:24.48
And it says, that was ran, my daughter.

3284
03:44:24.48 --> 03:44:26.48
So my daughter tricked you, tried to trick me.

3285
03:44:26.48 --> 03:44:29.48
I laughed about like, I was like, yeah, I knew.

3286
03:44:29.48 --> 03:44:32.48
I said allegedly, oh yeah, I knew.

3287
03:44:32.48 --> 03:44:35.48
I will say I was kind of, I was kind of strange that she would have written that.

3288
03:44:35.48 --> 03:44:37.48
That's why I was kind of surprised.

3289
03:44:37.48 --> 03:44:38.48
Like, was not a character.

3290
03:44:38.48 --> 03:44:39.48
Yeah, I was out of character.

3291
03:44:39.48 --> 03:44:41.48
I thought maybe something bad had happened, like,

3292
03:44:41.48 --> 03:44:44.48
some annoying thing, you know, like whatever made Braxton mad.

3293
03:44:44.48 --> 03:44:45.48
Something like that.

3294
03:44:45.48 --> 03:44:47.48
Something made her mad.

3295
03:44:47.48 --> 03:44:50.48
But luckily I didn't respond.

3296
03:44:50.48 --> 03:44:52.48
Imagine if I would have responded in anger.

3297
03:44:52.48 --> 03:44:54.48
Yeah, don't do that.

3298
03:44:54.48 --> 03:44:55.48
That's ego.

3299
03:44:55.48 --> 03:44:56.48
I got to keep that ego in check.

3300
03:44:56.48 --> 03:44:57.48
I kept the ego in check, is what I'm saying.

3301
03:44:57.48 --> 03:44:59.48
But it sometimes can be tricky.

3302
03:44:59.48 --> 03:45:01.48
Good thing you relaxed.

3303
03:45:01.48 --> 03:45:03.48
Looked around, made her call.

3304
03:45:03.48 --> 03:45:04.48
Step back.

3305
03:45:04.48 --> 03:45:06.48
Put my ego in check.

3306
03:45:06.48 --> 03:45:07.48
But that's the thing.

3307
03:45:07.48 --> 03:45:09.48
What was causing my, like, all that little,

3308
03:45:09.48 --> 03:45:11.48
that little trail of thoughts that I had, I was doing this.

3309
03:45:11.48 --> 03:45:12.48
I was doing that.

3310
03:45:12.48 --> 03:45:13.48
How if we're here?

3311
03:45:13.48 --> 03:45:15.48
You're making, this is ego, ego, ego, ego.

3312
03:45:15.48 --> 03:45:17.48
So I'd be fine even respond.

3313
03:45:17.48 --> 03:45:18.48
I was just like, okay, you know what?

3314
03:45:18.48 --> 03:45:19.48
And you know what?

3315
03:45:19.48 --> 03:45:21.48
I thought to myself, and I do this a lot.

3316
03:45:21.48 --> 03:45:24.48
I want my wife to be at a point where,

3317
03:45:24.48 --> 03:45:27.48
if she can be on vacation.

3318
03:45:27.48 --> 03:45:28.48
Yeah.

3319
03:45:28.48 --> 03:45:30.48
In a foreign country.

3320
03:45:30.48 --> 03:45:32.48
By the way, then I'm paying for it.

3321
03:45:32.48 --> 03:45:33.48
And she can be mad, because I didn't

3322
03:45:33.48 --> 03:45:37.48
said her a birthday tax at 434 in the morning when I woke up.

3323
03:45:37.48 --> 03:45:39.48
That's like, that's a good, that's the new way

3324
03:45:39.48 --> 03:45:41.48
that's where you know things are good for her.

3325
03:45:41.48 --> 03:45:43.48
So I was kind of a little bit stoked.

3326
03:45:43.48 --> 03:45:45.48
But you got to watch that ego, man.

3327
03:45:45.48 --> 03:45:46.48
Got to watch that thing.

3328
03:45:46.48 --> 03:45:48.48
It's ready to bite.

3329
03:45:48.48 --> 03:45:52.48
You can go and get on it.

3330
03:45:52.48 --> 03:45:53.48
This is cool.

3331
03:45:53.48 --> 03:45:55.48
This is where we start going.

3332
03:45:55.48 --> 03:45:57.48
Man, you say, from that point forward,

3333
03:45:57.48 --> 03:45:59.48
my life began to more for rapidly.

3334
03:45:59.48 --> 03:46:01.48
When I was a younger man, I had thought courage strength

3335
03:46:01.48 --> 03:46:04.48
and tenacity were traits that made a man worthy of the title.

3336
03:46:04.48 --> 03:46:09.48
But by exercising each of those traits at different times during and after

3337
03:46:09.48 --> 03:46:10.48
the way I realized they were not enough.

3338
03:46:10.48 --> 03:46:11.48
They're important.

3339
03:46:11.48 --> 03:46:13.48
Highly important, but they are not sufficient.

3340
03:46:13.48 --> 03:46:15.48
Enough to make life worth living.

3341
03:46:15.48 --> 03:46:19.40
that what Grandpa had been trying to teach me all along was that a good man and a good

3342
03:46:19.40 --> 03:46:23.40
life are made of balance, growth, and selflessness.

3343
03:46:23.40 --> 03:46:27.52
If those three things are a person substrate, everything else will take care of itself.

3344
03:46:27.52 --> 03:46:31.36
Strength is important, but it must be balanced with caring.

3345
03:46:31.36 --> 03:46:38.20
Selflessness, as hard as it may be to spot, erodes the perveyor, or sorry, selfishness,

3346
03:46:38.20 --> 03:46:42.40
as hard as it may be to spot, erodes the perveyor, the victim, and all those caught

3347
03:46:42.40 --> 03:46:46.78
in between. If a person is focused on growth, no matter the challenge, here she will always

3348
03:46:46.78 --> 03:46:52.66
come out better than they were before the impetus. A mindset of growth helps us internalize

3349
03:46:52.66 --> 03:46:58.10
our mistakes and craft better strategies for the next bout of trouble. If we can do it without

3350
03:46:58.10 --> 03:47:06.02
crushing our spirits under the weight of our own self judgment, that is.

3351
03:47:06.02 --> 03:47:09.86
Here's where we get rock and enrol when I decided to quit smoking cold turkey was difficult,

3352
03:47:09.86 --> 03:47:15.26
but no bub by no means excruciating. I limited my drinking to a couple days a week and

3353
03:47:15.26 --> 03:47:22.38
started each day at 5 a.m. This latter bit being the key to squashing Loki, Alka, his

3354
03:47:22.38 --> 03:47:30.14
alcoholism most abruptly. The change in my habits helped expedite what was already the most

3355
03:47:30.14 --> 03:47:33.86
rapid physical change in my body had gone through since Walter Reed. Every morning I

3356
03:47:33.86 --> 03:47:37.34
stretched out then a random mile. Soon that turned it into two miles. I was lifting

3357
03:47:37.34 --> 03:47:42.58
weights in my garage every morning and doing a 30 minute workout at night. I couldn't

3358
03:47:42.58 --> 03:47:46.90
exercise enough to satisfy my lust for health and vigor. Once my body was strong enough

3359
03:47:46.90 --> 03:47:51.10
to endure a little hiking, I set out looking for the teacher who had taught me the most

3360
03:47:51.10 --> 03:47:56.98
valuable lessons in my youth, the mountain. Each mile up those blustering ridges cut through

3361
03:47:56.98 --> 03:48:01.42
my delusions. The mountain is in different to our existence. We are nothing but another

3362
03:48:01.42 --> 03:48:06.14
speck upon its rims no more or less important than the rock beneath our feet or the

3363
03:48:06.14 --> 03:48:12.18
deer we chase. Ego is no currency in the wilderness. That's a lesson we can all stand

3364
03:48:12.18 --> 03:48:18.58
to learn. I read a scuvered God or at least or at the very least you could say that I

3365
03:48:18.58 --> 03:48:22.38
had read discovered meaning. But I think that's a distinction without any real

3366
03:48:22.38 --> 03:48:27.14
difference in the vastness of the wild. The indifference of the Rockies humbled me

3367
03:48:27.14 --> 03:48:39.38
humility and truth set me free. I started feeling pretty good about this book now. You

3368
03:48:39.38 --> 03:48:44.62
started speaking and you had been speaking. But you know it's weird. You talk about

3369
03:48:44.62 --> 03:48:47.46
when you're speaking you kind of felt like a fraud. Like you be telling people like

3370
03:48:47.46 --> 03:48:52.78
yeah you can overcome anything. You'd be like I'm full of shit. Yeah. Those people

3371
03:48:52.78 --> 03:48:57.62
who have a club back the money coming back. Well that was for that not for

3372
03:48:57.62 --> 03:49:04.14
profit though. So they were like paying me. God. The God. You do a corporate

3373
03:49:04.14 --> 03:49:07.74
adventure talking of you know professional athletes. Then you went to the summit in

3374
03:49:07.74 --> 03:49:13.98
veil. There was a bunch of academic people there. One of those people was a

3375
03:49:13.98 --> 03:49:18.06
monk who taught ethics at MIT. You say that he taught us the most valuable

3376
03:49:18.06 --> 03:49:22.58
lesson I'd ever learned. Life is suffering. It is only by accepting that fact

3377
03:49:22.58 --> 03:49:26.02
that we can lessen it. I'd been saying something closer than speeches for years

3378
03:49:26.02 --> 03:49:33.90
but he helped concretize it for me. I was done laying my problems at the feet

3379
03:49:33.90 --> 03:49:37.62
of others. I got online and searched for any information I could find on

3380
03:49:37.62 --> 03:49:42.78
brain injuries. I found that I had demonstrable signs of TBI. I remembered that

3381
03:49:42.78 --> 03:49:47.10
the VA sent me a letter listing all the most common symptoms of both brain

3382
03:49:47.10 --> 03:49:51.38
injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. I wasn't going to read these but I

3383
03:49:51.38 --> 03:49:55.66
actually am going to just because it's important for people to know these

3384
03:49:55.66 --> 03:50:00.74
things. Common symptoms of PTSD. One, we experience the event over and over again.

3385
03:50:00.74 --> 03:50:03.54
You can't put it out of your mind no matter how hard you try. You have

3386
03:50:03.54 --> 03:50:07.54
repeated nightmares about the event. You have vivid memories almost like

3387
03:50:07.54 --> 03:50:10.94
it was happening all over again. You have a strong reaction when you encounter

3388
03:50:10.94 --> 03:50:16.06
reminders such as a car backfiring. Two, you avoid places or feelings that

3389
03:50:16.06 --> 03:50:19.42
remind you of the event. You work hard at putting it out of your mind. You feel

3390
03:50:19.42 --> 03:50:23.98
numb and detached so that you don't have to feel anything. You avoid people or

3391
03:50:23.98 --> 03:50:29.22
places that remind you of the event. Three, you feel keyed up or on-edge at all

3392
03:50:29.22 --> 03:50:33.58
time. You may startle easily. You may be irritable or angry at all. All the time

3393
03:50:33.58 --> 03:50:37.42
for no apparent reason. You are always looking around hypervisulant of your

3394
03:50:37.42 --> 03:50:42.38
surroundings. You may have trouble relaxing or getting sleep. And then this

3395
03:50:42.38 --> 03:50:46.42
thing that you looked up goes on to talk about TBI. Common signs of brain injury,

3396
03:50:46.42 --> 03:50:51.86
difficulty organizing daily tasks, blurred vision or eyes tire easily, headaches

3397
03:50:51.86 --> 03:50:56.50
are ringing in the ears, feeling sad, anxious or listless, feeling irritated or

3398
03:50:56.50 --> 03:51:00.38
angered, feeling tired all the time, feeling light, headed or dizzy, trouble with

3399
03:51:00.38 --> 03:51:03.74
memory attention or concentration. More sensitive to sounds, lights or

3400
03:51:03.74 --> 03:51:08.58
distractions, impaired decision making or problem solving, difficulty inhibiting

3401
03:51:08.58 --> 03:51:14.90
behavior, impulsive, slow thinking, moving, speaking, or reading, easily confused,

3402
03:51:14.90 --> 03:51:22.26
feeling easily overwhelmed, change in sexual interest or behavior. Then you say this.

3403
03:51:22.26 --> 03:51:26.50
The last 150 pages of this book and the decade it took to live it, looking

3404
03:51:26.50 --> 03:51:30.94
retrospect like an aggregate of those symptoms played out in one person's

3405
03:51:30.94 --> 03:51:35.10
experience. I'd long understood that the VA wasn't taking my brain injury

3406
03:51:35.10 --> 03:51:40.50
very seriously, but after reading that paper it became immediate that I, it became

3407
03:51:40.50 --> 03:51:44.66
immediately apparent that I had not taken the brain injury I incurred seriously

3408
03:51:44.66 --> 03:51:51.58
enough. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was actually straight from the letter that

3409
03:51:51.58 --> 03:51:57.70
they had just nailed me. Like that's the chart for whatever the memo. Isn't it

3410
03:51:57.70 --> 03:52:02.86
kind of interesting to take all those symptoms and just send it to on the letter

3411
03:52:02.86 --> 03:52:07.34
to someone that has these symptoms like you won't be able to do exactly what it says.

3412
03:52:07.34 --> 03:52:12.14
It makes no sense whatsoever. Like you would be able to read this because you'd be

3413
03:52:12.14 --> 03:52:15.42
irritated, you'd be confused, you haven't trouble like you organized and shit.

3414
03:52:15.42 --> 03:52:22.90
They're watching to do all this. What's wrong with them? That's ridiculous.

3415
03:52:22.90 --> 03:52:32.26
You know, this is important section. What was I to do with the fact that my brain,

3416
03:52:32.26 --> 03:52:36.34
the organ we used to process reality was permanently damaged. I didn't want to blame my

3417
03:52:36.34 --> 03:52:40.58
own personal failures and there were many. This is such a key point. I didn't want to

3418
03:52:40.58 --> 03:52:43.82
blame my own personal failures and there were many on something that was out of my

3419
03:52:43.82 --> 03:52:49.02
control. I knew that was too simple and answer. The temptation to use this new

3420
03:52:49.02 --> 03:52:54.42
information as a scapegoat was strong, but deep down in my core, I knew that taking

3421
03:52:54.42 --> 03:52:59.98
that path would only lead me toward more suffering. I wasn't going to do that again. I

3422
03:52:59.98 --> 03:53:04.46
decided that the best I could do was accept that I had incurred an injury that had made

3423
03:53:04.46 --> 03:53:09.26
and would continue to make my life harder than it was before. It was time to move forward

3424
03:53:09.26 --> 03:53:15.66
with that fact fully internalized. scapegoating would be another cop out more cowardice.

3425
03:53:15.66 --> 03:53:21.50
I was done with that road. So you had a realization that, okay, you read through all this

3426
03:53:21.50 --> 03:53:26.86
stuff and I said to say, well, okay, that's why I've been behaving this way. It's like, no, no, no,

3427
03:53:26.86 --> 03:53:34.54
scapegoat. Yeah, I mean, you can't. Maybe you can give yourself a little bit of, like,

3428
03:53:34.54 --> 03:53:40.46
as I tend to carry a lot of, I tend to place a lot of burden on myself. For shit I've done

3429
03:53:40.46 --> 03:53:45.02
in my life and make it a little easier to be like, all right, whatever, you know, let

3430
03:53:45.02 --> 03:53:50.62
some of that stuff in the past. It makes it easier to let things in the past go. But you can't

3431
03:53:50.62 --> 03:53:56.38
use it moving forward or you're just fucking a lot of thought. You have to just accept that

3432
03:53:56.38 --> 03:53:59.58
this is a thing. And really like, even like, let's say the impulse,

3433
03:53:59.58 --> 03:54:04.62
civility stuff or the trouble organizing will you get a fine to work around. Yeah, that's

3434
03:54:04.62 --> 03:54:11.98
it. And just think if you think yourself, well, oh, I have PTSD and TBI, that's why I'm

3435
03:54:11.98 --> 03:54:17.98
impulsive. Now you're just like, oh, and I'm cleared hot. Yeah, to be more impulsive. Yeah,

3436
03:54:17.98 --> 03:54:23.10
we're gonna stand up again. Like, I'm like, yeah, or, or I, I have trouble organizing things.

3437
03:54:23.10 --> 03:54:27.34
That's why I'm late to the, you know, whatever. That's why I didn't turn in this thing. Like,

3438
03:54:27.34 --> 03:54:31.26
yeah, you can use that excuse or like you said, you can say, oh, I know I have trouble organizing.

3439
03:54:31.26 --> 03:54:34.62
I just want to write stuff down. I got to make a plan. I got to put reminders there. Whatever.

3440
03:54:35.34 --> 03:54:43.58
Freaking actually take ownership of it. A good friend of mine and a green bra we call

3441
03:54:43.58 --> 03:54:48.38
preacher stopped over around the time I discovered this problem. While we were visiting, I shared

3442
03:54:48.38 --> 03:54:52.94
within my new world view about the importance of humility and acceptance and how I felt the

3443
03:54:52.94 --> 03:54:59.34
mountain could teach a man, both things. Then he tells you this, there is a forbidden mountain

3444
03:54:59.34 --> 03:55:05.82
hike on the big island of Hawaii that you have got to do. You have to start your scent around

3445
03:55:05.82 --> 03:55:10.86
midnight so you can reach the peak before sunrise. The view is incredible. Echo Charles?

3446
03:55:11.90 --> 03:55:16.30
Not from the cinema. Not from earlier? Not from earlier? Not out of nowhere. It's overlooking

3447
03:55:16.30 --> 03:55:22.38
helo. Is it a name? Is it a name? It's Monica and he was being totally full of shit. It's not.

3448
03:55:22.38 --> 03:55:27.42
He was just trying to get me to go. It's not a forbidden hike. Oh, he just called it that? Yeah,

3449
03:55:27.42 --> 03:55:31.82
he just, he was like, yeah, there's this trail. It's a legal man. You got to just jump on it.

3450
03:55:31.82 --> 03:55:36.94
I was like, all right. Tell you something about Monica. That's the first time I ever saw snow in my life.

3451
03:55:37.82 --> 03:55:42.54
Monica? What's the altitude do you know the altitude? 133. Oh, it's 133.

3452
03:55:42.54 --> 03:55:51.02
Three damn. Yeah, it's hot. And there's like at the very top, it's hard. There's like nine or

3453
03:55:51.02 --> 03:55:56.62
10 different peaks, like small ones, you know, whoops. So because it's a volcano, right? So there's

3454
03:55:56.62 --> 03:56:02.22
like lots of little, like extra. It's hard to tell which is like the real peak. I mean,

3455
03:56:02.22 --> 03:56:07.26
there's even a survey story. But then there's all those, I'm looking at you like you look at

3456
03:56:07.26 --> 03:56:11.82
it. I'll put you like well, a little bit. He knows a little bit. He's from Hawaii. Yeah, a lot of times I'm saying.

3457
03:56:11.82 --> 03:56:19.74
That's why I'm still not an expert on my neck. So you know, so you get this goal. You start

3458
03:56:19.74 --> 03:56:27.98
freaking training because you're going to go climb the forbid mountain. Yeah. On your way there,

3459
03:56:27.98 --> 03:56:43.02
you get on the dating app and you swipe right. And on a female, a girl named Randy, R&D.

3460
03:56:45.26 --> 03:56:51.58
That's why you're sitting in the airport at Salt Lake. And then you land and you find you land in

3461
03:56:51.58 --> 03:57:00.86
Kona. You find out that you had cheered matched. Dude, I did this, I'm too old for all that. Like,

3462
03:57:00.86 --> 03:57:07.50
I mean, I was married and I'm just too old and miss that whole. That whole thing, the whole thing.

3463
03:57:09.50 --> 03:57:16.54
To think back in the day, you had to just randomly meet a female out of all the millions of females.

3464
03:57:16.54 --> 03:57:25.58
And now you can just literally go on and access. Yeah. Access upon access. Well, in the

3465
03:57:25.58 --> 03:57:31.74
promo, I did that. And pre-screened access, too. Like, hey, like, it's you're writing about

3466
03:57:31.74 --> 03:57:37.18
you're looking at her little profile. She's like shooting a bow, right? And like, whatever,

3467
03:57:37.18 --> 03:57:42.54
she's got a dog. She's shooting her bow. Yeah, you're like, check.

3468
03:57:42.54 --> 03:57:47.74
Yeah, I'm like, pre-screened. Hey, I want some of that. I want to female. It's Brunette.

3469
03:57:47.74 --> 03:57:53.26
It knows how to shoot an art. She's not. She's like, good to go. Absolutely. But I cut you off.

3470
03:57:53.26 --> 03:57:59.26
We're going to say, no, no, no, no. I, you know, I tried like the bar. Like, if you're in your

3471
03:57:59.26 --> 03:58:05.34
mid mid mid late 20s, I mean, I don't know really where you meet chicks. You know, it's like,

3472
03:58:06.30 --> 03:58:10.54
the bar or the grocery store. And so like I tried the bar thing. That should don't work.

3473
03:58:10.54 --> 03:58:16.14
So I was like, we'll on a try just about anything at that point. And a lot of people say,

3474
03:58:16.14 --> 03:58:20.54
like, go to church. And I guess that's probably a good answer. But I, I didn't go to church. So

3475
03:58:20.54 --> 03:58:24.62
but I mean, even if you went to church, you could meet how many girls at church? Nine. Right.

3476
03:58:24.62 --> 03:58:30.30
Yeah. You know, maybe like 20, 20, 20, 13? I don't know. Yeah. But you go on the app.

3477
03:58:30.30 --> 03:58:34.54
And it's like you can meet how many, but million. You know, you girls. Right, that

3478
03:58:34.54 --> 03:58:38.54
coach, I was. I know. You don't know either. But I'm saying because you're the technical expert

3479
03:58:38.54 --> 03:58:42.94
and you're the tech guy. I'll, I would guess one million. Yes. Right. Sure.

3480
03:58:43.90 --> 03:58:46.94
Am I wrong? I don't look for your. It's got to be a lot. Right. A lot of people.

3481
03:58:46.94 --> 03:58:50.38
You got to be a lot of people. It's got to be a lot of people. It's got to be a lot of people. We know what.

3482
03:58:50.38 --> 03:58:54.54
I actually do know. You know why? Because I got friends that are kind of in the getting still.

3483
03:58:54.54 --> 03:58:58.54
Yeah. And they'll be like, bro. There's a lot. There's a lot. It's a million.

3484
03:59:00.78 --> 03:59:06.86
But all those millions, you swipe right on the bow hunter. Yeah. And or at least the archery.

3485
03:59:06.86 --> 03:59:17.66
And you land there. You end up sending her like a just a text back and then you end up climbing this mountain.

3486
03:59:20.38 --> 03:59:24.62
I'm going to fast forward past the details of the climb. It's pretty cool to read about the climb.

3487
03:59:24.62 --> 03:59:32.38
And what what happened on that? You have another like you have some more. Let's say moments of

3488
03:59:32.38 --> 03:59:40.46
discovery in that and and I'll say this. You say the forbidden mountain. Allegedly for

3489
03:59:40.46 --> 03:59:46.06
bed mountain is the gateway to the grandest sunrise on earth. I reflected on my life.

3490
03:59:46.06 --> 03:59:56.70
A top that volcano all 29 years of it. And I'm going to I'm going to fast forward now

3491
03:59:56.70 --> 04:00:05.74
to the to the kind of the I guess it's this a little bit of the summation of what you talk about

3492
04:00:05.74 --> 04:00:11.42
towards the end of this and the things that you figured out. And again, I'm hitting the highlights.

3493
04:00:12.14 --> 04:00:19.58
This is a book almost 300 page book of lessons for for anyone for any human being

3494
04:00:20.14 --> 04:00:24.54
filled with lessons for any human being. Here are some of them. I spent almost a decade suffering

3495
04:00:24.54 --> 04:00:31.18
things in my youth. I never could have imagined some caused by life. Some were caused by associating

3496
04:00:31.18 --> 04:00:39.58
with the wrong people. Other abouts by society. But most can be laid directly at my own feet.

3497
04:00:43.74 --> 04:00:49.58
So many more so many of our problems. It's a lot more than we think. The problems that we

3498
04:00:49.58 --> 04:00:55.90
caused. The problems that we initiated. Yeah, look like you said life's going to bring some at you.

3499
04:00:56.70 --> 04:01:00.78
Some some some people are going to bring them at you sometimes. Sometimes society's going to bring

3500
04:01:00.78 --> 04:01:10.54
these problems to you. But way more than we think are because of us. Back to the book when I was

3501
04:01:10.54 --> 04:01:15.34
wounded. I made a clear choice. One of the few choices I ever made that I'm deeply proud of.

3502
04:01:15.34 --> 04:01:20.54
I decided that I would rather put my flesh in harm's way than have a friend of mine put at risk

3503
04:01:20.54 --> 04:01:27.26
for reasons that I did not think were worthy. When I was lying on the ground bleeding to death,

3504
04:01:27.26 --> 04:01:33.18
I was in a great deal of pain torment that you cannot imagine if you've not endured it. But it

3505
04:01:33.18 --> 04:01:43.90
wasn't suffering. I was serving my country, my family, and my brothers. I didn't truly suffer

3506
04:01:43.90 --> 04:01:52.38
until I started lying to myself and to others about my problems with nightmares, stress, and sleep.

3507
04:01:53.74 --> 04:02:01.66
Those lies built into other lies and those lies built into more until one day I was a suicidal

3508
04:02:01.66 --> 04:02:14.30
nihilistic addict. I created my own hell and it nearly destroyed my soul. You continue on a little

3509
04:02:14.30 --> 04:02:20.30
bit further. You can't hide from a dragon or he will burn down your entire village and all that

3510
04:02:20.30 --> 04:02:27.34
you love and care about with it. You must face him. When I ran from the dragons my life crumbled

3511
04:02:27.34 --> 04:02:32.78
the spirit split apart and burned. It was like my soul itself was fractured.

3512
04:02:35.26 --> 04:02:39.42
Then one day I decided I would face my problems one at a time. I wanted to own them.

3513
04:02:40.70 --> 04:02:45.02
When I did or at least started to, I improved almost instantaneously,

3514
04:02:45.74 --> 04:02:51.10
then more pumped up. More dragons. I think this is why we feel overwhelmed when we try to take on

3515
04:02:51.10 --> 04:02:56.14
our problems. There are always dozens more than we thought there were and it's not until we emerge

3516
04:02:56.14 --> 04:03:02.94
from our cowardly little hiding places that we can see them all clearly. This overwhelming feeling

3517
04:03:02.94 --> 04:03:07.74
can crush us if we were not stiffened our spine for combat. That is why I think it's important

3518
04:03:07.74 --> 04:03:12.62
that we crush our most pressing physical obstacles before we try to take on the mental ones.

3519
04:03:13.02 --> 04:03:18.06
If we can stop eating terrible diets that we know are killing us, if we can run when others say

3520
04:03:18.06 --> 04:03:23.82
we can't walk, if we can put down the bottle that is drowning our soul, then we know we can do anything.

3521
04:03:23.82 --> 04:03:29.98
The lessons we learn on the physical journey will steal our resolve for the longer, much

3522
04:03:29.98 --> 04:03:36.94
harder fight for our mental and spiritual health. Sometimes when we first emerge and feel completely

3523
04:03:36.94 --> 04:03:43.10
overwhelmed we run back to our hiding places. We see so many little dragons that we are afraid of the

3524
04:03:43.10 --> 04:03:49.82
aggregate of issues that will demolish us. Maybe that isn't the worst thing. Sometimes armies must

3525
04:03:49.82 --> 04:03:56.30
retreat in order to regroup and acquire some help before they fight another day. We can use this

3526
04:03:56.30 --> 04:04:01.90
philosophy as well but we can't make it a habit. We must go back into the fray again the moment we

3527
04:04:01.90 --> 04:04:09.50
are ready and again then we become practiced. We have doled our swords on so many small dragons

3528
04:04:09.50 --> 04:04:14.46
that we understand their weaknesses as well as we do our own. This gives us the ability to take

3529
04:04:14.46 --> 04:04:21.42
them out more easily to see them for the minuscule issues that they often are. Fear makes the wolf

3530
04:04:21.42 --> 04:04:29.26
bigger than he is. The best antidote for fear is experience. The first step then is to get the

3531
04:04:29.26 --> 04:04:34.86
physical body in order no matter what that takes, no matter how steep the climb may be. The next

3532
04:04:34.86 --> 04:04:41.66
is to stand up for truth in your own life all the time. I swore an oath to my brothers in Arlington.

3533
04:04:41.66 --> 04:04:46.70
I fail to keep it many times and probably will fail again but I am on the course right now.

3534
04:04:46.70 --> 04:04:52.22
Those failures will happen less and less often as I gain more and more experience. You may not have

3535
04:04:52.22 --> 04:04:57.90
a national shrine to cling as your guiding light but maybe your mother or father. You have your

3536
04:04:57.90 --> 04:05:03.02
children and their futures. Certainly my kids are the centerpiece of my life now. What better

3537
04:05:03.02 --> 04:05:09.82
thing could you do for them than to get yourself together? To lead by example, to face your mistakes,

3538
04:05:09.82 --> 04:05:16.78
fears and the chaos of life with a steel spirit and selfless heart? What better thing could you do?

3539
04:05:17.98 --> 04:05:25.90
Nothing. Teach them to manifest courage, integrity, honor and selflessness in their own lives

3540
04:05:25.90 --> 04:05:32.62
by living those virtues so fully that they cannot help but to see them displayed.

3541
04:05:32.62 --> 04:05:38.78
Slee your dragons or they will consume you.

3542
04:05:47.34 --> 04:05:51.58
Slee your dragons or they will consume you. Have you ever read my book like you in the dragons?

3543
04:05:51.58 --> 04:05:57.74
No. God. Okay. Probably giving it to your shortening. How old are your youngest?

3544
04:05:57.74 --> 04:06:07.50
My youngest is eight months old. My daughter's 14 years old and my sons are three and four.

3545
04:06:07.50 --> 04:06:11.26
Okay. Cool. So eight months. We got Mikey in the Dragons candidates there. Yeah.

3546
04:06:15.34 --> 04:06:22.94
So the book is just outstanding. Like I said, so many lessons learned in there. You did a

3547
04:06:22.94 --> 04:06:35.74
good college. I went for what did you study? It was all the stuff you have to do to pre-rext

3548
04:06:35.74 --> 04:06:44.38
them. How long did you take you to write this? Eight months, a year or something. I wrote a lot

3549
04:06:44.38 --> 04:06:51.18
of that out of a backpack and the whole thing in a leather bound into leather bound journals with

3550
04:06:51.18 --> 04:06:57.82
a fountain pen because I'm a fucking nerd. No. Transfer that onto the computer.

3551
04:06:59.10 --> 04:07:04.78
leather bound notebook and a fountain pen. You still have that? Oh yeah, I got both of them. That's

3552
04:07:04.78 --> 04:07:11.74
pretty legit. That's pretty cool. I don't have any cool stories like that. I'll sit there with a

3553
04:07:11.74 --> 04:07:19.58
word processor. I have no, none of that stuff. You talk about a little in the book. What made you

3554
04:07:19.58 --> 04:07:28.70
decide to start writing this? I started writing it at first. It almost right after they retired me,

3555
04:07:28.70 --> 04:07:37.82
but it was just bad. You just like knew I wasn't ready. I just knew I wasn't ready. And then

3556
04:07:37.82 --> 04:07:43.98
when I was doing all those corporate gigs, you know, you're always constantly getting prodded to

3557
04:07:43.98 --> 04:07:51.10
write a book and I was kind of thought like why? I don't know. I just didn't find there was a story

3558
04:07:51.90 --> 04:07:56.70
in there and then a good friend of mine kept pushing on me and I find that well. Maybe I'll give

3559
04:07:56.70 --> 04:08:05.98
a shot and kind of looked around and the other stories that were around just didn't seem to be

3560
04:08:05.98 --> 04:08:13.82
feeling that it just seemed to be conveying exactly what I was saying my friends go through. You know,

3561
04:08:13.82 --> 04:08:19.66
like, or me had some friends that were doing really great and then I had some friends that were

3562
04:08:19.66 --> 04:08:27.58
going to jail and some, you know, one community suicide, you know, and I just felt like no one was

3563
04:08:27.58 --> 04:08:34.54
telling the full story and I also didn't want. It felt like the two genres of Iraq Warbook were

3564
04:08:34.54 --> 04:08:45.58
either like heroism or super whiny, crybaby shit and then just the heroism stuff is great and

3565
04:08:47.18 --> 04:08:51.90
I mean, every culture has always done that's great and I should continue but like the super whiny

3566
04:08:51.90 --> 04:08:57.66
bitch that we just, there's no reason for that. But I understand the attempt to kind of try to write

3567
04:08:57.66 --> 04:09:00.94
something different. I said, well, I'll just try to tell my story and hopefully we'll fit somewhere

3568
04:09:00.94 --> 04:09:09.82
not on the one-y bitch skill, you know, and like fill that other gap. You know, I mean,

3569
04:09:09.82 --> 04:09:14.30
I knew that I couldn't be the only guy that had had. I got to think that there's at least

3570
04:09:15.18 --> 04:09:20.78
10,000 guys from the Jewaw that it had similar stories. I mean, not exactly same wounds but

3571
04:09:21.98 --> 04:09:27.34
they're definitely out there. So then, so you finished the book? This got published in 2017?

3572
04:09:27.34 --> 04:09:33.50
Yeah. Yeah. And so what do you up to now? So obviously you married Randy. How do you say

3573
04:09:33.50 --> 04:09:41.26
name was Randy? So you married Randy? You got kids. And what are you doing? I start cults.

3574
04:09:42.22 --> 04:09:46.54
Full time, I'm a cult starter and a whole lot of people can really cook before we go on. I just

3575
04:09:46.54 --> 04:09:51.58
want to point out that I did say in the book that he bullshit to me that it wasn't really for bidden

3576
04:09:51.58 --> 04:09:57.18
on the high. I just want to clear that up. Sorry, anyway, that was a eating out

3577
04:09:57.18 --> 04:10:02.22
me. No, yeah. No. So, wait, when did he say that? When did he tell you his bullshit?

3578
04:10:02.22 --> 04:10:05.58
That it wasn't for bidden before you hyped it? Well, he didn't have to tell me. And once I got

3579
04:10:05.58 --> 04:10:10.86
you got there, there's a big trail behind you. Yeah. So it was before you got there. He said it's

3580
04:10:10.86 --> 04:10:14.94
not really for bidden. No, no, no, no, no. I'm saying I put in the book that he was bullshit.

3581
04:10:14.94 --> 04:10:20.46
And then, just make a sense. What I was saying is I just don't want someone out there listening

3582
04:10:20.46 --> 04:10:24.06
thinking that I was calling this a forbidden hike because people would be like, oh,

3583
04:10:24.06 --> 04:10:28.38
how's he talking about it? Because for fairly the only person that thought was a forbidden hike with me.

3584
04:10:28.38 --> 04:10:35.26
I was like, no, yeah. So, but I'm a cold star. So, I was trained,

3585
04:10:35.26 --> 04:10:40.46
trained horses, start colds and trained morsels and I've been working on another book for a while,

3586
04:10:41.26 --> 04:10:51.34
nothing to do with me to do with the roots of like America. The best way I think I would articulate

3587
04:10:51.34 --> 04:10:58.54
is when people, when you ask somebody, what it means to be American, they have all of these ideas

3588
04:10:59.18 --> 04:11:06.46
of where that, and that sort of ethos came from. And my contention is that it was born on the pioneers,

3589
04:11:06.46 --> 04:11:12.70
and that actually mean on the American frontier by pioneers from, you know, Kentucky all the way to

3590
04:11:12.70 --> 04:11:18.22
California. I mean, you're like, you can point to like, let's say like this, if you were to ask an

3591
04:11:18.22 --> 04:11:23.90
American to describe what it means to be American, they're going to talk about shit like four to

3592
04:11:23.90 --> 04:11:31.90
two perseverance, loyalty, dedication, love of family, country, you know, spirit, right?

3593
04:11:33.74 --> 04:11:38.30
I mean, you can point to like, buy forge and maybe a couple of battles, but other than that,

3594
04:11:39.66 --> 04:11:45.66
the eastern sea board was like pretty much your 2.0. You know, I'm saying it's

3595
04:11:45.66 --> 04:11:50.46
glorious, lots of warglories there, and we fought our four fathers fought hard to

3596
04:11:51.42 --> 04:11:56.86
steal Europe 2.0 from them. But everything that happened on the frontier was new,

3597
04:11:57.42 --> 04:12:02.94
had never happened and well hadn't happened in 10,000 years, anything like that before. And so that's

3598
04:12:02.94 --> 04:12:08.94
why America felt so different because it had really had a totally different birth than any of these

3599
04:12:08.94 --> 04:12:13.90
other nations. So I've been working on that for a while, and then, you know, like I say,

3600
04:12:13.90 --> 04:12:17.82
right coats, and then I run this bunkhouse deal where I take guys out once a month,

3601
04:12:18.38 --> 04:12:25.18
train on different things, and like last weekend we were doing some advanced home defense training

3602
04:12:25.18 --> 04:12:32.70
in Utah with a green parade dude working on in suit houses and stuff like that. We've taken

3603
04:12:32.70 --> 04:12:42.30
dudes up, hunting, and we've run, I just facilitate all these wars, but we've done field med courses, and

3604
04:12:44.06 --> 04:12:49.18
yeah, we've done long range for choosing courses with some guys, and yeah, we just, so anyway,

3605
04:12:49.18 --> 04:12:54.46
these are basically my main focus and so far as work goes, and then after that it's just family.

3606
04:12:54.46 --> 04:12:59.50
How big is your ranch? So as a horse trainer, I can only ride,

3607
04:12:59.50 --> 04:13:04.06
well, used to be, I could ride about 10 a month, but now I have kind of too many other things.

3608
04:13:04.06 --> 04:13:08.70
So now I can only ride about six a month, so I keep about 15 head of horses in my house at

3609
04:13:08.70 --> 04:13:15.90
any one time, and then once I've ready myself, and then move on. And what's the name of the company

3610
04:13:15.90 --> 04:13:22.70
that does all like the tactical training? bunkhouse, it's the bunkhouse LLC, but it's not just tactical

3611
04:13:22.70 --> 04:13:29.02
stuff like I've taught basic horsemanship with them, I did a backhunt for navigation course with

3612
04:13:29.02 --> 04:13:35.50
some people, taught how to hunt basics course, the people I kind of hunt the mountains, basics,

3613
04:13:36.38 --> 04:13:41.42
so we try to spread out, like jack of all trades type skills as much as we can,

3614
04:13:41.42 --> 04:13:46.78
kind become more generous. Who are your clients? These guys, well, it's all it's

3615
04:13:46.78 --> 04:13:51.34
of the membership deal, so it's all an anchor. And then they just come and we're taking them out.

3616
04:13:52.06 --> 04:13:56.54
And every Wednesday, we have some expert for somewhere to come on, and we'll just do a

3617
04:13:56.54 --> 04:14:02.30
quick zoom call, and they'll have an hour, like usually me and that guy are a girl,

3618
04:14:02.30 --> 04:14:06.46
we'll just have a back and forth, and then we'll open it up, and then you can ask questions and

3619
04:14:07.10 --> 04:14:11.42
cover different, you know, whatever. How many people are members of the bunkhouse? We don't have a lot,

3620
04:14:11.42 --> 04:14:18.46
like 350, something like that. So it's easy to get into courses, super easy, but yeah,

3621
04:14:18.46 --> 04:14:22.78
I do that, it's kind of like a side-passion project thing. And if people want to do that, where do they

3622
04:14:22.78 --> 04:14:28.54
go to sign up for that? bunkhouse, stop, racks and a chord on a calm. Sure, it's super, yeah.

3623
04:14:28.54 --> 04:14:34.22
So you said that's your side project, what's your main project, Ryan Coles? That's the deal, huh?

3624
04:14:34.22 --> 04:14:41.50
Yeah, that's my jam. I love that shit. I love it, yeah, I've always loved it, but

3625
04:14:41.50 --> 04:14:46.46
now, I think it's really good for me mentally now too, because you can't like young horses,

3626
04:14:46.46 --> 04:14:53.02
you gotta say present and focus, you can't. You can't be thinking about others shit or worrying

3627
04:14:53.02 --> 04:14:59.58
about others shit. You gotta be on the horse, you know, like with him all the time. So I think it's good for me too.

3628
04:14:59.58 --> 04:15:04.62
How long does the transition take before they're ready to go out? To before you're ready to

3629
04:15:05.26 --> 04:15:10.38
give them to somebody else or someone else? It depends a lot on the horse, it depends a lot on the

3630
04:15:10.38 --> 04:15:14.94
horse. So if I'm riding like an outside horse, it'd be like a client's horse. I'll use you

3631
04:15:14.94 --> 04:15:19.74
to ride them for 60 to 90 days for them and then send them off. But I only do a little bit of that now,

3632
04:15:19.74 --> 04:15:25.98
because I wrote so many for people that they would take them and then just not ride them after they left.

3633
04:15:26.78 --> 04:15:31.90
And the problem is like you get a two-year-old that you put 60 days on and then the owner

3634
04:15:31.90 --> 04:15:36.30
goes and just parks it in a pasture for like six months and then goes to try to get on the next

3635
04:15:36.30 --> 04:15:41.98
spring. So like the horse doesn't even remember anything, you know. So now I only ride

3636
04:15:41.98 --> 04:15:47.90
colds outside horses for one big ranch. It's a neighbor mind. They run a big old spread.

3637
04:15:47.90 --> 04:15:51.34
But I'll ride them for them because they'll take them and use them as soon as they get back.

3638
04:15:52.46 --> 04:15:56.22
But so the average I would say it depends on what you're asking that horse to do. But if you're

3639
04:15:56.22 --> 04:16:01.82
trying to build like a safe trail horse, you could get a lot done depending on the age of that

3640
04:16:01.82 --> 04:16:06.06
horse, but you could get a lot done in a summer as long as the other person won't take them back

3641
04:16:06.06 --> 04:16:10.94
and use them. Now if you're sending it off to somebody who's like good and knows what they're doing

3642
04:16:10.94 --> 04:16:17.26
then usually the last for 60 or 90 days, ride on them and then take them. But like my stud horse,

3643
04:16:18.22 --> 04:16:21.90
I bought him from that ranch. I was just talking about because I was starting him for them.

3644
04:16:22.78 --> 04:16:26.14
And I'd, well the white hill, probably the best horse training in the country,

3645
04:16:26.78 --> 04:16:32.30
came out to help me with them, rope him, formed me that first day. You wanted to show me some tricks.

3646
04:16:34.38 --> 04:16:39.34
And so I rode in that day, put that first, do I rope to him for a bit and then I rode him

3647
04:16:39.34 --> 04:16:44.86
and then I took him out, rope to myself the next day and then I rode him two more times and then

3648
04:16:44.86 --> 04:16:50.22
that fifth time I took him out moving cattle for like 12 miles for that ranch. Yeah and he

3649
04:16:50.22 --> 04:16:54.86
was when he's a two year old. So it really depends on horse what you can get done. Now he wasn't

3650
04:16:54.86 --> 04:17:00.46
he sure is how I wasn't broke by then, but he was he was easy compared to a lot of other ones.

3651
04:17:00.46 --> 04:17:06.22
He was getting there. What about your hunting? I mean what's September looking like?

3652
04:17:06.22 --> 04:17:13.18
I'm hammered, September. I got a new MISCO buck tag that I'm super excited about. I got a friend of

3653
04:17:13.18 --> 04:17:21.82
mine gave me actually his mutual friend of Micah and I gave me a wine cut bull elk tag.

3654
04:17:22.70 --> 04:17:27.50
So that's I'm so for that and then obviously I got my elk hunt and I got one buddy coming up to

3655
04:17:27.50 --> 04:17:31.66
hunt and I got that promise I'd take for a week. So I really don't have a day off in September.

3656
04:17:31.66 --> 04:17:39.74
Is that is that all bull? Yeah for me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where are you going to awesome?

3657
04:17:40.86 --> 04:17:45.50
What else, man? What is that get us up to present day? Is there anything else you need to tell us about?

3658
04:17:46.54 --> 04:17:52.78
No, I mean no, so a couple of things did happen that weren't in that book at the IBC filter

3659
04:17:53.74 --> 04:17:59.58
that it's like up in your being a cave, a kind of behind your kidneys, essentially.

3660
04:17:59.58 --> 04:18:05.42
Yeah, just so everyone, I didn't read this book but that that had to put like a filter in your body

3661
04:18:05.42 --> 04:18:12.70
to prevent clots from getting what's your lungs. Yeah. And it's a some kind of mesh filter that they put in.

3662
04:18:12.70 --> 04:18:18.30
It just prevents blood clots from going through that screen. It's basically a screen and they

3663
04:18:18.30 --> 04:18:24.94
had to put it in. And so you've had that in you for what for a long time 15 years. Yeah.

3664
04:18:24.94 --> 04:18:33.10
Yeah, well I had it in for 12. And that I went in so I was running in during races for a while

3665
04:18:33.10 --> 04:18:39.50
to really good and actually like competitive in every race. I should have won the first one.

3666
04:18:39.50 --> 04:18:45.10
But how far the first one I ran was a due affluent. So it was a two mile run or

3667
04:18:45.10 --> 04:18:50.14
it might have been a yeah it was a two mile run and then I think a 20 mile bike right and then a

3668
04:18:50.14 --> 04:18:57.02
two mile run the first one. And then I was training for an ultra when I had this issue with my heart.

3669
04:18:58.38 --> 04:19:04.14
And I went in and they said I had a heart attack. That was like, well that's great.

3670
04:19:05.98 --> 04:19:11.66
So then I could have to quit training because you know heart attack. Well, it ended up

3671
04:19:11.66 --> 04:19:17.58
that it wasn't a heart attack which great. So I go up to the university you taught. Oh and this

3672
04:19:17.58 --> 04:19:22.22
the filter the way this filter ties in here is the I could get that on my hands with the

3673
04:19:22.22 --> 04:19:29.50
fuck. Um, and my doctors like it's there's a potential that your filter is just like

3674
04:19:29.50 --> 04:19:35.58
releasing protein in your blood, you know. And because like, I guess the way like it's damaging

3675
04:19:35.58 --> 04:19:40.70
that blood vessel in there and it's releasing protein because I guess the way that it's like a heart

3676
04:19:40.70 --> 04:19:45.90
attack is protein in your bloodstream or certain type of protein in your bloodstream. And that's

3677
04:19:45.90 --> 04:19:52.06
what they had detected. So he's like, I said, can we get this thing out then, you know,

3678
04:19:52.06 --> 04:19:56.54
because I'd really like to do this whole ultra deal. And he said, no, you're stuck with us.

3679
04:19:56.54 --> 04:20:01.10
Been in there for two long. There's no way it's coming out. So I came home and got, you know,

3680
04:20:01.10 --> 04:20:05.02
long Google start looking and look like probably right like you probably couldn't get it out.

3681
04:20:05.58 --> 04:20:09.18
So then I want to do an at doctor tells me something to go home and Google it.

3682
04:20:09.18 --> 04:20:13.58
Yeah. Well, this dude doesn't know what you thought about. I think he got Google son.

3683
04:20:13.58 --> 04:20:21.42
Web M.D. What? So I went and got on J. Store and so I was looking for any article. I could

3684
04:20:21.42 --> 04:20:27.18
find in the turn or any paper rather. I could find. And then turned out there's a doctor up a

3685
04:20:27.18 --> 04:20:32.86
radiologist, I think he is, I think, pretty sure, up in Penn State that had done, had to

3686
04:20:32.86 --> 04:20:39.50
remove like three or four of them or some shit. At like, I forget seven or eight years in and I was

3687
04:20:39.50 --> 04:20:45.58
over that, but you know, so the max that I could find that had been length of time that I could find

3688
04:20:45.58 --> 04:20:51.26
that had been removed was like seven or eight years. So meanwhile, I'm doing all this

3689
04:20:51.26 --> 04:20:56.86
hardship in between trying to figure this out. Well, finally my wife was like, won't you just call

3690
04:20:56.86 --> 04:21:01.90
University U-Ton to ask the radiology department? I was like, those pictures, they don't,

3691
04:21:01.90 --> 04:21:05.10
it's like, I can't find anything from them in the J Store. Like, what do they know?

3692
04:21:05.10 --> 04:21:10.46
You know? So she calls and she's like, hey, they said that you can come up for a consultation on

3693
04:21:10.46 --> 04:21:16.78
Wednesday and that they do this all the time. They can get it out. I'm sorry. Okay. So we go up there.

3694
04:21:17.66 --> 04:21:23.18
I mean, well, I'm so waiting on all my heart prognosis stuff, right? And we go up there and meet with

3695
04:21:23.18 --> 04:21:29.82
the radiologist and he's like, yeah, coming on Friday, we'll take it out. I was like, why is it a

3696
04:21:29.82 --> 04:21:36.30
radiologist? Because the way the procedure works is they have to keep you awake and they put some

3697
04:21:36.30 --> 04:21:45.02
shit in your blood so they can see it. Yeah. So he's like coming on Friday and meanwhile, my

3698
04:21:45.02 --> 04:21:48.54
primary care physician told me he's like, man, you know, if you try to get this removed,

3699
04:21:48.54 --> 04:21:53.42
you're being a cable, you could rupture, you know, like there's no way to plug that. And

3700
04:21:53.42 --> 04:21:58.86
somehow, like, stress down. Okay, damn bro, you can give me like a weak to think of anything.

3701
04:21:58.86 --> 04:22:05.74
So it ended up getting pushed off until the next Friday. But I went in and they got that sucker out. It was

3702
04:22:06.62 --> 04:22:11.50
like, I guess the way the way this guy had done it was so that the top of that deal, there's like a

3703
04:22:11.50 --> 04:22:17.74
little loop. And that I mean, that's how it was designed to be able to be removed if so they push

3704
04:22:17.74 --> 04:22:22.14
this thing onto it and try to squish it together like this because it looks almost like a umbrella

3705
04:22:22.14 --> 04:22:26.86
without a skirt on it. And so they would push it deal over it. They'd kind of squish the umbrella

3706
04:22:26.86 --> 04:22:31.74
together. And if that doesn't work, then there's a loop on top of the filter. And they would try to

3707
04:22:31.74 --> 04:22:37.10
hook a thing on it and pull it out with that. But if that thing, the reason that people weren't

3708
04:22:37.10 --> 04:22:41.42
able to get them out is if that thing straightened out, no, you just have like a sharp thing in

3709
04:22:41.42 --> 04:22:46.06
there and like how to get out. So with this guy done, he must have grew up like blue car or something

3710
04:22:46.06 --> 04:22:50.46
because he was like, I'll just put a damn alligator clamp on there and just shove that bitch.

3711
04:22:50.46 --> 04:22:58.14
So that's what he did. He invented like this tool. Anyway, he got that out which was great. I mean,

3712
04:22:58.14 --> 04:23:02.78
it was like my arm was stuck like this for a couple of days because they go down your jugular to

3713
04:23:02.78 --> 04:23:09.10
rip it out. So that was good. I just wanted to like update it was good. That things out of there

3714
04:23:09.10 --> 04:23:13.90
are not not to worry about dying because they my freaking doctor when I went in he's like,

3715
04:23:14.86 --> 04:23:19.90
he's like, well, eventually that you know, that IBC filter would just plug up. I was like, well,

3716
04:23:19.90 --> 04:23:25.82
how long? Yeah, well, that does the sound cool. Yeah, and he's like, I'm like, 10, 15 more years

3717
04:23:25.82 --> 04:23:33.42
probably maybe 30. I'm like, well, I'm freaking 31 years old. I'm like, I was like 20. Yeah, I'm probably 30 at

3718
04:23:33.42 --> 04:23:39.58
the time. So anyway, they got that out which was great and then we pushed on on the heart stuff

3719
04:23:39.58 --> 04:23:45.74
and turned out that my heart was actually okay. They, at one of the scans, so they didn't echo

3720
04:23:45.74 --> 04:23:51.82
and then whatever that other one is where they put you through CT and they look at some shit.

3721
04:23:51.82 --> 04:23:56.86
I forget but anyway, they'd give you like a calcium score on your arteries and all of this and

3722
04:23:56.86 --> 04:24:01.66
I had a calcium score of zero. So I'll tell my wife, I was like, I got that baby on her.

3723
04:24:02.06 --> 04:24:05.90
Like, I want to hear no more shit about all my stakes. Is that because you have filter in there

3724
04:24:05.90 --> 04:24:10.14
for so long or why is that? I don't know. I don't really care. I just, I don't want to like,

3725
04:24:10.14 --> 04:24:15.42
I don't want to hear any more shit about bacon and eggs and fatty stakes. Yeah.

3726
04:24:15.42 --> 04:24:21.58
I should get the bring up the rib eyes. Yes, right. So it turns, it actually turned out I just had a

3727
04:24:21.58 --> 04:24:28.78
scar on my heart from getting hit in the plates with an exposure or dam. So, so my heart's

3728
04:24:28.78 --> 04:24:33.82
easier to plate the glyc after the, do you know? Yeah, I could, oh, I got them. Yeah, I should

3729
04:24:33.82 --> 04:24:39.50
be a picture actually. I jacked up. Not really. So my, the plates I had had to

3730
04:24:39.50 --> 04:24:44.94
steal back or on them. There's like, I think they were, I can't remember what level they were at the time.

3731
04:24:46.06 --> 04:24:52.62
Mike, my uncle was, did you have side-sappy plates in? No, I took everything on the front.

3732
04:24:55.34 --> 04:24:59.50
My uncle was like a, I can't remember if he's a major or a light kernel in the air force,

3733
04:24:59.50 --> 04:25:06.14
like a, uh, a wreck investigator or something. And he had just rotated out and he had bought these fancy

3734
04:25:06.14 --> 04:25:11.18
ass plates so he just mailed them to any sort of those. And so we're, because I took, I can't

3735
04:25:11.18 --> 04:25:17.90
have his five or six in the plate. The craziest part is game over man. Oh, you've got a hundred

3736
04:25:17.90 --> 04:25:23.18
percent. Two of them are like right here. I mean, right by the heart, maybe toast. I'm not,

3737
04:25:23.18 --> 04:25:30.22
almost dead before he had the ground. Yeah. Yeah, and the craziest part about those plates is I didn't

3738
04:25:30.22 --> 04:25:34.62
realize this until one of my engineer buddies came over the other day and he was like trucking them

3739
04:25:34.62 --> 04:25:40.70
out and put them on my counter and it's like warped like wobbles. So it's like I get hard enough to

3740
04:25:40.70 --> 04:25:46.14
like tweak it. Yeah. What was the range that you got hit from? Probably 15 meters, this.

3741
04:25:47.58 --> 04:25:54.54
And luckily, you know, I have my head down like this. I guess like this. So probably my

3742
04:25:54.54 --> 04:26:07.18
K-pop took a lot of that concussion. Oh, yeah. Instead of taking it all right here. Man. Is that

3743
04:26:07.18 --> 04:26:11.82
get us up to present then? Yeah, man, everything's good now. I got four kids and life is looking great.

3744
04:26:14.14 --> 04:26:21.42

3751
04:27:04.46 --> 04:27:08.86
Got any questions over there? Yeah. Remember we were talking about your IT band? Yeah. So where we

3752
04:27:08.86 --> 04:27:14.30
had with that? I mean, doesn't get like jammed up or what? Because that's kind of a big deal. Right?

3753
04:27:14.30 --> 04:27:23.02
I split down this down the middle. Yeah. Every morning, I heat up a bath as hot as I can tolerate it.

3754
04:27:23.02 --> 04:27:30.22
Everyone. Yeah. And I mean, like if I'm at a honing or training again, but otherwise every morning,

3755
04:27:30.22 --> 04:27:35.34
hard as I get it instead in there for 20 minutes and just try to stretch it with my hands and then

3756
04:27:35.34 --> 04:27:40.86
I get out and stretch as much I can and then I roll it and just hope for the best. Yeah. Does it like,

3757
04:27:40.86 --> 04:27:46.38
like after about of like physical activity does it like act up like right after whatever? Especially

3758
04:27:46.38 --> 04:27:52.70
honing, especially yeah. My knees get jacked and it starts to dig with my hips too and my

3759
04:27:52.70 --> 04:27:56.94
low back starts to get weird even. Just yeah, everything gets kind of just out of place.

3760
04:27:57.74 --> 04:28:03.18
And then you said you have ball bearings in you still. Yeah. Damn. How many?

3761
04:28:04.38 --> 04:28:10.06
I think it's around eight or so. I have to, I got the nurse patient on the Instagram. I'm all looking

3762
04:28:10.06 --> 04:28:19.18
to see. That's crazy. And how bigger these? They're like, uh, size of a P. Like a little bigger than a P. Yeah.

3763
04:28:19.18 --> 04:28:26.86
That's marble smaller than a marble slightly bigger than a P. That's a say P.

3764
04:28:26.86 --> 04:28:33.50
Right. They're literally, they're literally wheel bearings. So they are. That's crazy.

3765
04:28:33.50 --> 04:28:37.74
That's pretty typical with S best. Yeah. But they could put like you we say and I really like they could

3766
04:28:37.74 --> 04:28:45.50
put like nails and just random like bolts nuts just any metal crap that'll freaking rip you apart.

3767
04:28:47.50 --> 04:28:54.14
What if you done with Micah? I just I don't know. I have never met him. We just have a mutual friend.

3768
04:28:54.14 --> 04:28:58.54
All right. No, I know. God. Then those him. You guys definitely need to link up. That's what you said.

3769
04:28:58.54 --> 04:29:05.10
Yeah. That's really gonna awesome. Any, any closing thoughts, bro? No, just thank you for having

3770
04:29:05.10 --> 04:29:10.86
me. I appreciate it. Well, I'm sorry. It took us a long and thanks for joining us.

3771
04:29:11.66 --> 04:29:16.86
More important. Obviously, man. Thanks for what you did in Ramada. You, you and the rest of the

3772
04:29:16.86 --> 04:29:23.26
guys in the 2 to 8 didn't incredible job taking the fight to the enemy and prepared the battle

3773
04:29:23.26 --> 04:29:31.02
field for us and we got there. And also made incredible sacrifices. And we will not forget what

3774
04:29:31.02 --> 04:29:39.82
you guys did and we'll never forget your sacrifice or the sacrifices of guys like Lieutenant Colonel

3775
04:29:39.82 --> 04:29:46.70
Micah McCawflin and Sergeant Adam Can and so many of the other brave soldiers and Marines

3776
04:29:48.46 --> 04:29:56.14
who sacrifice their lives for their brothers. And we will live to honor them. And thank you for

3777
04:29:56.14 --> 04:30:02.30
helping us find a way to do that. Appreciate it, brother. Thank you, sir. I'm appreciate you.

3778
04:30:04.54 --> 04:30:12.78
And with that, Braxton McCawley has left the building for an outstanding guy and

3779
04:30:16.30 --> 04:30:23.90
get the book. The book is is just, it's a great book. I will look. We scratch the surface on it.

3780
04:30:23.90 --> 04:30:30.54
There's so much stuff. I feel like I didn't do a good job. I didn't do the book justice.

3781
04:30:30.54 --> 04:30:34.62
And what I read. I don't know because there's a lot in there, man. There's a lot in there.

3782
04:30:35.50 --> 04:30:40.30
And part of it is because you got to kind of tell the story. You know what I mean?

3783
04:30:40.30 --> 04:30:43.74
You got to, I mean, at least that's what I feel. I feel like you got to kind of know what's going on.

3784
04:30:44.38 --> 04:30:49.58
And that kind of leads me to read a little bit more of the what's going on stuff

3785
04:30:49.58 --> 04:30:54.30
as opposed to some of that internal dialogue and some of the discovering stuff like that. So

3786
04:30:54.30 --> 04:31:04.94
it's just an awesome book. Order the book. I feel like I enjoyed related maybe in a weird way

3787
04:31:04.94 --> 04:31:10.38
more than normal with Ellen. Maybe it was because of how he was too. I think just the whole thing

3788
04:31:10.38 --> 04:31:17.02
together. I was like, I felt not, I mean, in a way more into it, but more like

3789
04:31:17.02 --> 04:31:25.50
you can connect, like I connected with it a lot, like a lot more than the normal I guess given the

3790
04:31:25.50 --> 04:31:31.74
circumstances, you know. You think maybe it's because he's more your age. But actually he's not

3791
04:31:31.74 --> 04:31:38.94
more my house. I mean he's 36. Yeah, I'm like 40. Six eight eight. How old are you? 44.

3792
04:31:39.58 --> 04:31:43.82
But I'm very youthful. I wasn't thinking youthful.

3793
04:31:43.82 --> 04:31:51.82
immature. Yes. Okay. I was thinking. Oh, right. There you go. But what the the part like how he

3794
04:31:52.70 --> 04:31:58.38
he's talking about like the alcoholism and then like his anger at this anger that for some reason,

3795
04:31:58.38 --> 04:32:05.02
like the way he put it was like that's so true. Like almost like not that I necessarily felt

3796
04:32:05.02 --> 04:32:09.82
all of that, but it was like I felt like I can see how that could be. I could totally see how that could

3797
04:32:09.82 --> 04:32:15.50
be. And this one part that I think he like nailed was when he was like something about the existence

3798
04:32:15.50 --> 04:32:22.86
of the devil where alcohol and drugs are like his tools. Yeah. So true. All right, I'm almost

3799
04:32:22.86 --> 04:32:27.10
as I'm almost tempted to say, Frick, that is the devil. That's like you know, the devil's like

3800
04:32:27.10 --> 04:32:32.86
spirit coming down and like touching people in the jam in a mop because it's true. Where and he was

3801
04:32:32.86 --> 04:32:37.66
saying that I don't know if he said it on air, but he was saying I think it was before we were

3802
04:32:37.66 --> 04:32:43.50
recording and he was like, hey, people in school or people like teachers and stuff in school,

3803
04:32:43.50 --> 04:32:49.02
people when you're young, they don't tell you that drugs are like kind of good. Like they feel good.

3804
04:32:49.02 --> 04:32:53.34
Do you say that when he did it on air, yeah. Okay. He's like, they don't tell you that.

3805
04:32:53.34 --> 04:32:59.02
They lie. Yeah. And then it kind of jumps you up. But it's true though. It's like, and obviously

3806
04:32:59.02 --> 04:33:04.46
different people like different drugs. Like I don't have that much drug experience, but the very

3807
04:33:04.46 --> 04:33:09.66
limited that I do like no drugs to me felt good at all. Like even like painkiller, I took the

3808
04:33:09.66 --> 04:33:16.06
all that oxy, like, not more, but like you know the ones that give you food surgery. Yeah after surgery,

3809
04:33:16.94 --> 04:33:21.50
bite it in like all these ones. I took when I got neck surgery, you know, I was like,

3810
04:33:21.50 --> 04:33:25.98
I'm not taking anything. I'm so tough. And then I got home and then stuff war off and I was like,

3811
04:33:25.98 --> 04:33:31.50
give me whatever they gave you to my wife as I gave it to me now. That's true. But the weird thing

3812
04:33:31.50 --> 04:33:39.66
is it didn't feel like it didn't feel any like we even he described like euphoria. I didn't feel

3813
04:33:39.66 --> 04:33:43.74
any of that. I just felt like okay I can go to sleep now, you know, because I'm not in agony. Yeah,

3814
04:33:43.74 --> 04:33:48.38
like kills. So I didn't, I didn't, I don't know. I feel a little bit like weird and woo, woo,

3815
04:33:48.38 --> 04:33:52.38
you're wondering if you feel that. I didn't like it though. I didn't really feel that either.

3816
04:33:52.38 --> 04:33:57.02
But then even like weed and stuff like that. It's like, yeah, I don't like the feeling or whatever

3817
04:33:57.02 --> 04:34:03.74
except for how go. That's the one. That's you. That's your, that's where the devil gets you.

3818
04:34:03.74 --> 04:34:08.78
Yeah. And that's where I experienced the devil scenario. Because it is. It's like,

3819
04:34:08.78 --> 04:34:11.74
all especially when you're having fun or you're bonding with someone and you guys are

3820
04:34:11.74 --> 04:34:15.58
both going down memory lane on hardcore and you just don't want it to end. You're like, oh,

3821
04:34:15.58 --> 04:34:20.38
you're the best. There is alcohol helping it. It's helping me. It seems like I'm helping

3822
04:34:20.38 --> 04:34:24.86
me and then like the next day that pray. I remember I was drinking with K. That's

3823
04:34:24.86 --> 04:34:30.38
the right. I'm not going to tell you what doesn't matter when something is very recent scenario.

3824
04:34:32.38 --> 04:34:36.78
I'm working at the master. We didn't have to.

3825
04:34:36.78 --> 04:34:40.94
To know like, they think you had that later flight on Saturday. I mean, you're

3826
04:34:40.94 --> 04:34:47.18
certain extending the good time like way past like the plant and just, you know,

3827
04:34:47.18 --> 04:34:51.26
and we're just, they were doing that quite don't memory lane talking trash. I mean,

3828
04:34:51.26 --> 04:34:56.06
laugh huge laughs. Huge on all the best. It was the best. Then the next morning we're

3829
04:34:56.06 --> 04:34:59.26
because we're on the same, not on the same flight, but same time. So we're all going to

3830
04:34:59.26 --> 04:35:05.10
their part together. And like we're sitting. But why do we even do that? Like, how I feel

3831
04:35:05.10 --> 04:35:08.30
right now? It's like not even worth it. Like even last time was super good fun, but it's

3832
04:35:08.30 --> 04:35:11.98
not even worth feeling like this. How much percentage of fun could you have had without

3833
04:35:11.98 --> 04:35:17.02
alcohol the night before? I don't know. Like, let's say you had, let's say you had 90%

3834
04:35:17.02 --> 04:35:24.22
fun without alcohol the night before how much fun would you have? I don't know. I mean,

3835
04:35:24.22 --> 04:35:29.82
because I'm tempted to say, well, you're at 90. Probably 90 or 89 or whatever, because I think I can.

3836
04:35:29.82 --> 04:35:34.62
But it could have been maybe like 25. I think I can truly have like 90%.

3837
04:35:34.62 --> 04:35:39.82
Yeah, all the fun. I understand. We're there without. Yeah, I understand, but like, not everyone's

3838
04:35:39.82 --> 04:35:43.82
like that straight up, where just because like, especially cake, now, she's kind of a reserved,

3839
04:35:43.82 --> 04:35:48.62
like, person. Oh, you know, to break down that. But when we're together, it's cool, but then you

3840
04:35:48.62 --> 04:35:52.94
could tell because there's other people like, main tie was with us at some point. Oh,

3841
04:35:52.94 --> 04:35:58.62
dude. It got that. There's like that, huh? We don't even know where main tie was. We don't know

3842
04:35:58.62 --> 04:36:03.10
where he showed up, where he departed. Sorry to freaking bust through my mind of the bust. But

3843
04:36:03.10 --> 04:36:08.54
nonetheless, it was like, you know, certain things you're like, oh, um, but the key point is the

3844
04:36:08.54 --> 04:36:12.38
next day. It wasn't even worth it. It wasn't worth it. And we were literally talking about

3845
04:36:12.38 --> 04:36:17.42
how it's not worth it. So it's like a deal with in the moment. It's worth it. Bro, you can, I'm

3846
04:36:17.42 --> 04:36:22.14
thinking about the play. It's a complete lie. It's a complete lie, but you feel it like to

3847
04:36:22.14 --> 04:36:27.26
your in your bones that it's worth it at the time. And the next day, you know, the reality. That's

3848
04:36:27.26 --> 04:36:32.30
the devil right there. That's the sneaky. It is true. And it's how he put that. How's like,

3849
04:36:32.30 --> 04:36:40.06
bro, you're spot on? Yeah. No, he definitely, you know, I even that last underground podcast we

3850
04:36:40.06 --> 04:36:44.62
did were a guy asked, you know, I hate you know how much drink he should I be doing. You know,

3851
04:36:45.66 --> 04:36:49.02
I got the friend group. They would they don't really want to drink. You know, how you want

3852
04:36:49.02 --> 04:36:53.26
to get away from me to drink? I'm just like, I can't even, I can't even give. As a matter of fact,

3853
04:36:53.26 --> 04:36:58.86
I saw I talked to somebody at the, at the, at the master who was, you know, who's had issues.

3854
04:36:59.90 --> 04:37:02.94
And he said when he heard that question, he was like, please talk, I'll please say, say the

3855
04:37:02.94 --> 04:37:06.30
right thing. Say the right thing. And I was like, you know, I can't even say what he's like, yes,

3856
04:37:06.30 --> 04:37:12.22
he goes, he can't because it's a freaking lie. Yeah. It is. It's a lie, man. Let's stay clean out there.

3857
04:37:12.22 --> 04:37:17.02
Stay clean. Stay clean. I think he said about the ego, which like, conceptually, it was like a

3858
04:37:17.02 --> 04:37:20.54
lot of times, like you'll say this, what he said, this very specific thing where he said,

3859
04:37:20.54 --> 04:37:24.62
although army should have kept me in, even though he knew he couldn't admit it. But it's weird

3860
04:37:24.62 --> 04:37:29.18
because like you kind of have that feeling. It's almost like, I underserved circumstances. Obviously,

3861
04:37:29.18 --> 04:37:32.38
like, you know, it depends on who you are. But it's like, you know how,

3862
04:37:32.38 --> 04:37:39.66
it's almost like a more advanced version of the simple idea of like, you know, the classic, like,

3863
04:37:39.66 --> 04:37:45.34
oh, they didn't invite me to the party, even though I didn't want to go. But like, I still should be invited,

3864
04:37:45.34 --> 04:37:49.26
you know, kind of, because it's me, it's like a weird illusion. And if you really, if you really

3865
04:37:49.26 --> 04:37:53.98
pull the string on that, like, you can blame everything. Like, oh, they didn't keep me in the army.

3866
04:37:53.98 --> 04:37:59.26
That's why I'm drinking right now. Yeah. That's why I'm doing this. That's why I'm doing that. I'm out here.

3867
04:37:59.26 --> 04:38:02.78
That's why I got, you know, that's why I'm in this relationship with this person. Like, you can

3868
04:38:02.78 --> 04:38:08.70
but everything is just rooted in this one thing because they wouldn't keep me. That's a trap. And luckily,

3869
04:38:08.70 --> 04:38:13.90
you figured that out, man. Yeah. Luckily, figured that out. And it's good that other people,

3870
04:38:13.90 --> 04:38:21.82
hopefully can recognize these things. You know, another big point, physical, the physical well-being

3871
04:38:21.82 --> 04:38:26.86
is paramount. Yeah. You got to be, you got to, many, got to get, kind of get up in the morning.

3872
04:38:26.86 --> 04:38:30.86
You got to get after it. If you got to get up at 430, no, you got to have a bit of 5, no, but getting

3873
04:38:30.86 --> 04:38:37.66
up consistently, doing some work. So good for you, man. So good for you. So tunnel lessons there.

3874
04:38:38.46 --> 04:38:43.26
So good for you. Instead of drinking vodka. Yeah. I got a better idea.

3875
04:38:43.26 --> 04:38:48.22
We'll drink the discipline. Yeah. Yeah. I'll drink a mulk. Yeah. I'll mulk. Yeah. Boat. Drink a mulk.

3876
04:38:48.22 --> 04:38:54.38
Drink some go. Drink some maybe even want to drink a little bit of that pre-workout discipline. Go.

3877
04:38:54.38 --> 04:39:00.22
So Sarah goes, uh, my wife says, uh, she's like, you know what you should do? You should make a video.

3878
04:39:00.78 --> 04:39:04.22
And it was, this is like such an old concept. I've seen videos like this.

3879
04:39:04.22 --> 04:39:08.62
The glass or something. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't be like that right now. Such a,

3880
04:39:08.62 --> 04:39:12.06
she just doesn't want that idea. She doesn't want that idea. I like her idea. What was it?

3881
04:39:12.06 --> 04:39:18.46
She was almost TV like I did. I got you, sir. She was like, you know, she should do a video,

3882
04:39:18.46 --> 04:39:25.10
like showing like how discipline go. The energy drink is like it's energy drink, but it doesn't have sugar in it.

3883
04:39:25.10 --> 04:39:29.26
And then show this other energy drink that you can't show the label. Of course. And then just show

3884
04:39:29.26 --> 04:39:33.66
how much sugar is in it. And then do the quick. You know how they use the scoop of sugar. Yeah.

3885
04:39:33.66 --> 04:39:37.82
And be like, this is how much sugar you're drinking. She's like, do a video like that. That would be good.

3886
04:39:38.54 --> 04:39:41.82
You don't be funny. It's a good start of the video like that. But then we started saying it like,

3887
04:39:41.82 --> 04:39:46.22
oh, and here's a scoop of rap. Boys are sitting at our snake. We started pouring like actual

3888
04:39:46.22 --> 04:39:52.62
hell. Yeah. Boys go down. We'll do it. Yeah. Good idea. See AD, Jocco over here. Yeah. But it all originated with

3889
04:39:52.62 --> 04:39:58.94
Sarah Charles creative genius. And you're over there. Naysay. Maybe you need some discipline. Go

3900
04:40:59.50 --> 04:41:04.94
A lot of how should I say. Yeah. They're various things. But mainly it's a peril.

3901
04:41:04.94 --> 04:41:08.56
Well, barrel. You want to represent on this path.

3902
04:41:08.56 --> 04:41:13.66
Oh, barrel. Dislanguos freedom. Yeah. Good. We're restalking some stuff. We're going hard.

3903
04:41:13.66 --> 04:41:17.02
Oh, so we ran out of stock. We run out of stock. We run out of here. I'm here for von Meiss,

3904
04:41:17.02 --> 04:41:21.66
so you just put yourself on reward. Oh, it's a lifeline. Hey, look. It was better.

3905
04:41:21.66 --> 04:41:25.82
Pretty cool to see at the master of people representing with the Sherlock Ashirts. Yeah. You

3906
04:41:25.82 --> 04:41:30.46
can see that those are. Seems like the kind of hit it. String, and she's just a landing.

3907

They're landing. People are kind of stoked. People are kind of stoked.

3908
04:41:33.82 --> 04:41:38.56
because that's just like full representation.

3909
04:41:38.56 --> 04:41:40.82
Yeah, like, yeah, I'm in the game over here.

3910
04:41:40.82 --> 04:41:42.26
I'll decide what about you.

3911
04:41:42.26 --> 04:41:46.86
It's funny too, because people will come to me and ask me,

3912
04:41:46.86 --> 04:41:50.46
like, hey, where did that guy get that shirt?

if you want, you have excess exclusive access to,

3922
04:42:14.06 --> 04:42:15.66
like, yeah, all those stuff.

3923
04:42:15.66 --> 04:42:16.74
You know, all private stories.

3924
04:42:16.74 --> 04:42:18.54
You can buy anyone, anyone from the,

3925
04:42:18.54 --> 04:42:22.54
that's what's called observing the feedback loop.

3926
04:42:22.54 --> 04:42:25.62
The feedback loop with some people wanted some of those other shirts

3927
04:42:25.62 --> 04:42:27.78
that were, and come out.

3928
04:42:27.78 --> 04:42:29.46
Yeah, so they thought they missed it.

3929
04:42:29.46 --> 04:42:31.14
So it's like, oh, I missed that one shirt

3930
04:42:31.14 --> 04:42:33.62
and that's kinda, you know, the one and then maybe two,

3931
04:42:33.62 --> 04:42:35.54
three months later, they're like, oh, I missed that one again.

3932
04:42:35.54 --> 04:42:37.74
You're seeing saying, so it's like, they felt like,

3933
04:42:37.74 --> 04:42:41.74
apparently that was almost like a gamble, you know?

3934
04:42:41.74 --> 04:42:43.34
But it's not a gamble.

3935
04:42:43.34 --> 04:42:44.46
That's no gamble.

3936
04:42:44.46 --> 04:42:45.30
It's a win.

3937
04:42:45.30 --> 04:42:46.30
To win, to win.

Check out the YouTube channel, check out psychological warfare,

check out flip side canvas with Dakota Meyer,

3955
04:43:26.78 --> 04:43:29.78
making cool stuff to hang on your wall.

3956
04:43:29.78 --> 04:43:30.62
That's a good idea.

3957
04:43:30.62 --> 04:43:33.34
Books, you can get a bunch of books, I wrote a bunch of them.

3958
04:43:33.34 --> 04:43:36.94
But also, Braxon wrote one.

3959
04:43:36.94 --> 04:43:39.34
It's called the Glass Factory.

3960
04:43:39.34 --> 04:43:41.34
When I'm saying this right now, whenever you're listening this,

3961
04:43:41.34 --> 04:43:45.30
there's only 300 hard covers left that Braxon McCoy.com

3962
04:43:45.30 --> 04:43:47.18
and they get a last long.

3963
04:43:47.18 --> 04:43:49.62
If they are, get one, that's a first-of-dish

3964
04:43:49.62 --> 04:43:52.10
that you ain't, you ain't come and buy again.

3965
04:43:52.10 --> 04:43:55.50
If they don't have that cool, get it from Amazon.

3966
04:43:55.50 --> 04:43:57.10
You'll get a one that's printed on demand,

3967
04:43:57.10 --> 04:43:59.18
which is still awesome because it's a great book, so many lessons.

3968
04:43:59.18 --> 04:44:01.42
And only cry for the living, check out Holley McCoy's book.

3969
04:44:01.42 --> 04:44:04.50
She's been on here before, wrote a fantastic book.

3970
04:44:04.50 --> 04:44:08.26
She risked her freaking life to write, so go check that one out.

3971
04:44:08.26 --> 04:44:11.62
And then I read a bunch of books, you know what they are.

3972
04:44:11.62 --> 04:44:14.22
Get the kids books.

3973
04:44:14.22 --> 04:44:17.06
I just realized I didn't give Braxon a copy of Mike

3974
04:44:17.06 --> 04:44:21.62
in the Dragons, all of the sudden, to him, Braxon hit me up.

3975
04:44:21.62 --> 04:44:24.26
So I've read a book, a bunch of books, check them out.

3976
04:44:24.26 --> 04:44:26.22
Actually, I'm front leadership consultancy.

3977
04:44:26.22 --> 04:44:28.74
Just finish the monster as we were just talking about.

3978
04:44:28.74 --> 04:44:31.38
Next one is Atlanta, Hot Lanna.

3979
04:44:31.38 --> 04:44:33.42
I'll go with 12 through the 14th.

3980
04:44:33.42 --> 04:44:36.62
We're gonna sell out COVID's over now, officially,

3981
04:44:36.62 --> 04:44:41.02
a fish, officially over, because people do not care.

3982
04:44:41.02 --> 04:44:42.30
And,

3983
04:44:44.02 --> 04:44:47.58
we're back to the pre COVID numbers at monster.

3984
04:44:48.50 --> 04:44:51.58
So it's gonna sell out, there you go.

3985
04:44:51.58 --> 04:44:53.54
Battle field, we're doing a EF battle field,

3986
04:44:53.54 --> 04:44:54.46
a little big horn.

3987
04:44:54.46 --> 04:44:56.78
It's almost sold out.

3988
04:44:56.78 --> 04:44:58.34
I think there's literally two more seats.

3989
04:44:58.34 --> 04:45:00.18
Probably not by the time you listen to this.

3990
04:45:00.18 --> 04:45:01.30
But if you wanna go to a little big horn

3991
04:45:01.30 --> 04:45:03.46
with us, check that out, all that stuff,

3992
04:45:03.46 --> 04:45:04.82
FeshLonefront.com.

3993
04:45:04.82 --> 04:45:07.62
Also, we have the Academy, Extremeownership.com.

3994
04:45:07.62 --> 04:45:09.10
We're teaching this stuff all the time.

3995
04:45:09.10 --> 04:45:11.78
Just did a live event today, interacting with everybody

3996
04:45:11.78 --> 04:45:13.06
that's on there.

3997
04:45:13.06 --> 04:45:15.10
If you have questions on how to handle a situation,

3998
04:45:15.10 --> 04:45:16.42
just go on there.

3999
04:45:16.42 --> 04:45:19.26
And you can ask me, and we can interact.

4000
04:45:19.26 --> 04:45:21.90
You can give me the details, the deats.

4001
04:45:21.90 --> 04:45:23.14
And you heard this expression?

4002
04:45:23.14 --> 04:45:23.98
Yeah, for me.

4003
04:45:23.98 --> 04:45:25.38
It's lame, isn't it?

4004
04:45:25.38 --> 04:45:25.98
Not bad.

4005
04:45:25.98 --> 04:45:26.82
I like it.

4006
04:45:26.82 --> 04:45:28.30
Keep it.

4007
04:45:28.30 --> 04:45:29.54
If you wanna help out service members,

4008
04:45:29.54 --> 04:45:30.98
active and retired, their families,

4009
04:45:30.98 --> 04:45:32.86
Mark Lee's mom, mom Lee.

4010
04:45:32.86 --> 04:45:34.58
She has an awesome charity organization.

4011
04:45:34.58 --> 04:45:36.62
What she does is she helps people,

4012
04:45:36.62 --> 04:45:39.82
helps veterans that need medical help,

4013
04:45:39.82 --> 04:45:41.38
that the government's not paying for.

4014
04:45:42.70 --> 04:45:47.06
So if you help her, she will help veterans,

4015
04:45:47.06 --> 04:45:48.38
that need it.

4016
04:45:48.38 --> 04:45:50.54
America's mighty warriors.org.

4017
04:45:50.54 --> 04:45:52.34
Also, we talked a couple times about Mike

4018
04:45:52.34 --> 04:45:54.30
today, his organization.

4019
04:45:54.30 --> 04:45:57.10
Heroesandhorses.org.

4020
04:45:57.10 --> 04:46:00.06
It's the first time I've gotten that thing, right?

4021
04:46:00.06 --> 04:46:04.34
So.org, he's taking vets up into the wilderness

4022
04:46:04.34 --> 04:46:06.18
for 41 days, 41 days.

4023
04:46:06.18 --> 04:46:08.54
Thanks for 41 days on the horseback.

4024
04:46:08.54 --> 04:46:10.82
Dude, freaking awesome.

4025
04:46:10.82 --> 04:46:14.38
And once again, Braxton,

4026
04:46:14.38 --> 04:46:16.54
what a, what a, what a stud, what a hero,

4027
04:46:16.54 --> 04:46:18.62
what an awesome guy, you can follow him.

4028
04:46:18.62 --> 04:46:20.82
He's on the web if you wanna talk to him.

4029
04:46:20.82 --> 04:46:23.74
Braxton McCoy.com.

4030
04:46:23.74 --> 04:46:26.94
His Instagram is Braxton. McCoy.

4031
04:46:26.94 --> 04:46:31.46
His Twitter is Braxton underscore McCoy.

4032
04:46:31.46 --> 04:46:33.02
Hit him up.

4033
04:46:33.02 --> 04:46:35.38
Of course, on the Twitter, on the gram,

4034
04:46:35.38 --> 04:46:37.94
on the Facebook, Echo's Echo Charles,

4035
04:46:37.94 --> 04:46:38.94
on that chocolate one link.

4036
04:46:38.94 --> 04:46:40.38
Listen, you go on there, cool.

4037
04:46:40.38 --> 04:46:41.22
I don't mind you going.

4038
04:46:41.22 --> 04:46:43.02
I don't mind you checking in.

4039
04:46:43.02 --> 04:46:44.94
Don't, don't dwell.

4040
04:46:44.94 --> 04:46:46.42
Don't hang out there.

4041
04:46:46.42 --> 04:46:48.54
Don't move in there.

4042
04:46:48.54 --> 04:46:50.50
Don't say, oh, I'm gonna look at this other thing.

4043
04:46:50.50 --> 04:46:51.34
And this other thing.

4044
04:46:51.34 --> 04:46:54.26
And just like that little dopamine grabs you

4045
04:46:54.26 --> 04:46:56.82
by the freaking throat and pulls you in there.

4046
04:46:56.82 --> 04:46:58.18
Don't do it.

4047
04:46:58.18 --> 04:46:59.98
Otherwise, I get my house right now.

4048
04:46:59.98 --> 04:47:01.14
Just kind of a couple people.

4049
04:47:01.14 --> 04:47:02.78
I had a couple of people from the underground.

4050
04:47:04.50 --> 04:47:05.82
Dopamine, dopamine.

4051
04:47:05.82 --> 04:47:07.30
So for those of you who don't know

4052
04:47:07.30 --> 04:47:09.82
that don't have the joc on the ground.com

4053
04:47:09.82 --> 04:47:12.34
at my house right now, if you pull out your phone

4054
04:47:13.42 --> 04:47:18.34
with my family, people just are going dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, dopamine.

4055
04:47:18.34 --> 04:47:19.18
So.

4056
04:47:19.18 --> 04:47:20.82
Yeah, it's real.

4057
04:47:20.82 --> 04:47:21.66
It's a real thing.

4058
04:47:21.66 --> 04:47:23.42
It's what we're doing.

4059
04:47:23.42 --> 04:47:25.50
Keeping people in check, I'm putting my phone back away

4060
04:47:25.50 --> 04:47:26.30
because they're annoying.

4061
04:47:26.30 --> 04:47:27.70
Right?

4062
04:47:27.70 --> 04:47:29.26
So don't let that happen.

4063
04:47:29.26 --> 04:47:30.58
But you can find us there.

4064
04:47:30.58 --> 04:47:31.66
Just watch out for the algorithm.

4065
04:47:31.66 --> 04:47:34.98
Special thanks to all the military personal personnel out there,

4066
04:47:34.98 --> 04:47:40.66
especially our wounded warriors who continue to fight long after the war

4067
04:47:40.66 --> 04:47:41.50
is over.

4068
04:47:41.50 --> 04:47:43.98
We salute you and thank you for everything.

4069
04:47:43.98 --> 04:47:48.50
You have done and everything you continue to do for our country

4070
04:47:48.50 --> 04:47:49.34
in our way of life.

4071
04:47:49.34 --> 04:47:51.86
Thank you to the wounded vets.

4072
04:47:51.86 --> 04:47:55.06
And also to our police and law enforcement firefighters,

4073
04:47:55.06 --> 04:47:57.90
paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers,

4074
04:47:57.90 --> 04:47:59.58
board patrol secret service.

4075
04:47:59.58 --> 04:48:01.42
All the first responders out there,

4076
04:48:01.42 --> 04:48:04.98
you also sacrifice every day to protect our way of life

4077
04:48:04.98 --> 04:48:06.34
here at home.

4078
04:48:06.34 --> 04:48:07.86
And we thank you for that.

4079
04:48:07.86 --> 04:48:09.38
And to everybody else,

4080
04:48:11.38 --> 04:48:15.82
remember these lessons learned from Braxton.

4081
04:48:15.82 --> 04:48:17.50
They're so important.

4082
04:48:17.50 --> 04:48:21.66
And look, they're so hard earned from Braxton

4083
04:48:21.66 --> 04:48:23.90
for what he went through to figure these things out

4084
04:48:23.90 --> 04:48:26.14
and then to pass them on to us.

4085
04:48:26.14 --> 04:48:28.62
The lessons do not lie to yourself.

4086
04:48:30.06 --> 04:48:34.22
That will be the main source of your suffering.

4087
04:48:34.22 --> 04:48:39.06
We often create the vast majority of our own problems.

4088
04:48:39.06 --> 04:48:40.54
And listen, I get it.

4089
04:48:41.82 --> 04:48:44.14
I get that you can't control everything.

4090
04:48:44.14 --> 04:48:45.86
No one can control everything.

4091
04:48:45.86 --> 04:48:49.42
But take ownership of what you can control.

4092
04:48:49.42 --> 04:48:51.90
And it's usually a lot more than you think

4093
04:48:51.90 --> 04:48:54.50
and then sharpen your sword.

4094
04:48:56.50 --> 04:48:57.70
Sharpen your sword.

4095
04:48:58.90 --> 04:49:02.90
And by that, I mean, your body, your mind, your spirit,

4096
04:49:02.90 --> 04:49:05.30
and then go out there into the world

4097
04:49:06.50 --> 04:49:08.06
and slay those dragons.

4098
04:49:09.82 --> 04:49:11.30
And until next time,

4099
04:49:11.30 --> 04:49:16.30
Zekko and Joko, out.
