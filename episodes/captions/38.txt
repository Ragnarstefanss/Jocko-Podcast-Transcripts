[00:02:24] Moving up and down again and there's no discharge in the war
[00:02:28] Good evening echo. Good evening. That's a poem. That's a poem called Infantry Colombs
[00:02:49] by Kippling. Who we've actually read before on the podcast. He was a British correspondent. He was an
[00:03:02] author. He was a poet. He was a patriot. A British patriot. And he was actually also critical of war
[00:03:12] and paraphrased from a book by a guy named David Gilmore, the long recessional. The imperial life
[00:03:23] of Richard Kippling. Kippling was deeply critical of how the war was fought and by the way
[00:03:29] he's talking about World War One of how the war was fought by the British Army as opposed to the war
[00:03:34] itself, which is kind of like hackworth. Hackworth was more opposed to the way we were fighting
[00:03:42] in Vietnam than he was opposed to the actual war itself. And he complained as early. This is Kippling
[00:03:50] complain as early as October of 1914 that Germany should have been defeated by now.
[00:03:56] And something must be wrong with the British Army. Kippling was shocked by the heavy losses
[00:04:02] that the British Expeditionary Force had taken by the autumn of 1914 and blamed the entire pre-war
[00:04:09] generation of British politicians who he had argued failed to learn the lessons of the Boer War
[00:04:18] and as a result thousands and thousands of British soldiers were paying with their lives
[00:04:24] for failures in the fields. And so there's some definite complexities to Kippling and it
[00:04:35] actually goes a little bit further and deeper with these complexities and there's a reason I
[00:04:40] started off with that poem. And that poem it is pretty much attributed that the idea of that poem
[00:04:54] which is obviously about marching long distances and it's attributed to a series of forced
[00:05:00] marches that were led by in the Boer War which were led by field martial lord Frederick Roberts who
[00:05:10] led 60,000 men on forced marches during the second Boer War in South Africa. He led these forced
[00:05:17] marches that were almost a thousand miles, nine hundred and fifty miles from Cape Down to Transvaul.
[00:05:24] And so that's kind of where this this poem comes from about how madening it is to march
[00:05:29] and how hard it is. But the interesting the other interesting piece of this is that Lord
[00:05:36] Robert, Lord Roberts who led this march was actually personal friends with Kippling. They were
[00:05:43] close friends and Lord Roberts was commander and chief of the army during World War I.
[00:05:53] And at Kippling's request at Rutt your Kippling's request, Lord Roberts allowed Kippling's son
[00:06:07] to be admitted to join the Irish guard he had some kind of a health problem. And so Kippling
[00:06:13] rid your Kippling called him up and said, hey my son's got a little health issue but he needs to
[00:06:17] get in the game. And Lord Roberts worked it out, you know commander and chief of the army and got him
[00:06:24] him admitted to the Irish guard. It was actually his eyesight he had poor eyesight. And so the
[00:06:34] the horrible piece I guess of that is that as I've mentioned the first time
[00:06:38] we read a Kippling poem on here is that read your Kippling son John Kippling was killed
[00:06:49] at September of 1915 the battle allus were the British suffered 60,000 casualties
[00:06:58] in three weeks of fighting 60,000 casualties. His body was never identified and he is one of the
[00:07:10] 20,000 British dead that are corrupt commemorated by the loose memorial. And while his body was never
[00:07:20] found there were accounts that he was last seen, the slogging through the mud blindly after a
[00:07:32] violent shell explosion had ripped off his face. And there's further connections and one of the lines
[00:07:45] in the poem is that there's no discharge in the war. And this is actually from the Bible.
[00:07:52] The Kleezy Astys 8-8 says there is no man that half power over the spirit to retain the spirit.
[00:08:01] Neither half he power in the day of death and there is no discharge in that war.
[00:08:07] So what he's saying there is no man half powers to power over the spirit to retain spirit. Meaning
[00:08:16] you can't keep your soul. When it's time for your soul to go you can't keep it.
[00:08:22] And then neither half he power over the day of death. Obviously you have no power to overcome death
[00:08:28] and there is no discharge in that war. And that is that this ultimate struggle between life and death
[00:08:40] that war that we fight for life itself. There's no escape. You can't get out of it.
[00:08:47] There is no discharge from that war. And maybe a little heavy way to start the podcast.
[00:09:01] But that poem also has a special meaning to a certain group of people in the navy and those of you
[00:09:06] that know what I'm talking about there. You know what I'm talking about there. And it's a poem
[00:09:13] that I thought of often in my career, especially when I strapped on my gear and heived on an
[00:09:22] overloaded rucksack for a long patrol or march. And when you do that,
[00:09:29] any soldier or military man will tell you this that when you do that, that is one of the most
[00:09:36] demanding parts of the job, the rock march, the long patrol, the hump, little walk,
[00:09:46] the forced road march. And even though you're with a group of people when you do that,
[00:09:54] when you're marching, you're very much alone. You're alone with your thoughts and there's
[00:10:02] things that you got to think about. You got to think about your field of fire. You got to think
[00:10:06] about your navigation. You got to think about rally points. You got to think about headcount. You got
[00:10:10] to think about terrain feature. You got to think about the enemy and booby traps and Idees and all that stuff.
[00:10:16] But even with that, there's still a lot of empty space to fill up inside your head. And I recently
[00:10:27] took my kids out on patrol. And I guess to be grammatically correct, it was a hike in the civilian
[00:10:39] world. But in my mind, it was a patrol. It felt like a patrol. And you know, it's the same thing.
[00:10:49] I mean, it's actually you're moving from point A to point B. You set security when you get there.
[00:10:54] You set your layout point, which civilians call like a campsite. Then you sleep and then you wake up
[00:11:00] and then you do it again. And as I did that patrol, and since it had been a while since I had
[00:11:06] done a patrol and because I was also watching my kids on their first patrol, I got to kind of revisit
[00:11:14] my little relationship that I have with patrolling over the years. And also as I saw them suffer and
[00:11:27] learn through their first patrol. I got to think into everything that I learned over the years
[00:11:36] from patrolling. And in doing that, I realized how much patrolling had taught me. So I'm there
[00:11:46] walking and I'm thinking about all these things that I learned because again, when you're
[00:11:50] patrolling, you got time. Even if you're thinking about navigation, you're thinking about all these things.
[00:11:54] It doesn't matter, even every piece of the job that you're focused on, it doesn't matter
[00:11:59] it's still space to fill. And that's what happened. You know, your mind starts to think about
[00:12:02] all these things. And it dawned on me how much patrolling and marching had taught me. And how it's
[00:12:12] really a fundamental component in everything that I did in the SEAL teams and the military.
[00:12:19] And like leadership, there are some fundamental principles that apply universally to so many
[00:12:24] things in life. And also just like leadership, there's a certain aspect of patrolling and navigation
[00:12:33] that is as much art as it is science. And the science, of course, is relatively easy to teach,
[00:12:42] but the art, as always, the art is hard to teach. And finally, with this this idea of navigation
[00:12:52] of moving from point A to point B, which includes plotting a course and picking way points along
[00:12:58] the way and identifying and avoiding obstacles and route and how to overcome unexpected obstacles
[00:13:05] and how and when and where to rest and everything else that navigation and patrolling includes
[00:13:10] and all those things are things that you face as you navigate life. And as you set goals as you
[00:13:22] establish where you're going. So I wanted to take a closer look at
[00:13:30] land navigation and how it relates to leadership and life and in digging in, I looked at,
[00:13:40] I looked at some of the information out there, some of the field manuals. And
[00:13:45] it's, it's, I learned from people, right? And I didn't learn from a book. And as I went to
[00:13:56] the books, I was coping that I could find what I had learned from people, but but I didn't really
[00:14:01] find it. I found pieces of it, glimpses of it, but nothing like what I was taught by the guys that
[00:14:09] raised me in the seal teams. And you know, I looked up the Army FM 3-Tect25.26 map reading and land navigation.
[00:14:19] And it's a thorough document and it's very heavy on the scientific side, the actual technical
[00:14:27] skill of it, how to set declination in a compass and how to orient the map and what the contour
[00:14:32] line, all the basic tools are in there. And there's some good quotes. One of the quotes it said,
[00:14:36] today the complexities of tactical operations and deployment of troops are such that it is essential
[00:14:43] for all soldiers to be able to read and interpret their maps in order to move quickly and effectively
[00:14:48] on the battlefield. Okay, I can't argue with that. You got to know where you are and if you ever
[00:14:52] heard me say this, I always used to ask the young, the young seal officers, what's the most important
[00:15:00] piece of information you need on the battlefield. And they would say, where the bad guys are,
[00:15:05] or how many guys you have, or how many enemy there are, or anything like that. They'd have a
[00:15:09] bunch of different ideas. And I would say, no, no, no, no, no. The most important piece of information
[00:15:14] you can have on the battlefield is where you are. You got to know where you are. Otherwise nothing
[00:15:20] else matters. And then I looked at a book called The Last Hundred Yards, which we actually covered
[00:15:27] on this podcast, podcast number three. And it goes through a section which is describing, it's
[00:15:34] talking about GPS and how now we've got GPS's and the GPS's can be unreliable and you can't
[00:15:42] count on them and all this stuff. And that's kind of true. It was even more true when that book
[00:15:46] came out, which was in 1995 and there was less satellites in the sky and the GPS received
[00:15:51] versus more and is good in the encryption methodology wasn't so dialed in yet. So the GPS is
[00:15:55] a were less accurate back then and they were also still pretty big. They were these big
[00:16:02] contraptions and even in 1993, 1994 the GPS is that I carried were big heavy things. Basically
[00:16:12] you had to assign a person to carry them. And now of course they're tiny. Everybody's got a GPS
[00:16:21] and you're on your iPhone or whatever smartphone you're using that or a thousand times better
[00:16:25] than the one I used to carry on my back. And they're also very accurate and reliable now in the
[00:16:32] military's come to rely heavily on them. Perhaps, perhaps a little too much. And I'm not going
[00:16:40] to be a guy that's like a stick in the mud that says hey don't evolve, don't learn anything
[00:16:45] because technology's awesome and you have to take advantage of it. But I also do think there's
[00:16:51] a need to remember the old ways. And I remember when GPS first came out and I was coming into the
[00:17:01] seal team and I had this thing. And I remember this, this officers, this officers, particularly
[00:17:06] said to me you know, hey all I need to do is we need to do is carry this thing and you know we'll
[00:17:12] know exactly where we are at all times. And he hands me this you know 20 pound brick but big box
[00:17:19] thing. And I kind of said hey man all I need to do is carry this map and compass and I'll know exactly
[00:17:25] where I am at all times. It's called land navigation. I want to learn it. But nowadays the GPS is
[00:17:34] our awesome and we definitely rely heavily on them. But it is, it is piece of the last hundred yards
[00:17:41] that definitely emphasizes that you have to know how to land now, which is good. But like I said,
[00:17:49] when I look through these books none of them gave me the same clear level of instruction that I learned
[00:17:56] about land navigation at patrolling when I first got into the teams back in the day. And again,
[00:18:07] these instructions and this methodology and some of these basic principles of patrolling and land
[00:18:12] nav they stuck with me and are really fundamental building blocks of how I ended up doing everything that I do.
[00:18:21] And they're really the basis of the attitude that I had that was very beneficial in leading
[00:18:31] me to having success in other areas, which was awesome. And so again here I am and taking my kids
[00:18:39] on their first patrol that made me realize this so clearly. And as I was thinking about it,
[00:18:44] I was like, I'm going to talk about this on the podcast. Because these are lessons that I learned
[00:18:49] that I actually forgot that I learned. You know what I mean? These are lessons that are so embedded
[00:18:55] that I forgot that I thought about them. But I think about them all the time. And then I'm seeing
[00:18:58] my kids do this. I'm thinking, oh yeah, they're there. They're learning this right now for the first
[00:19:04] time. And so to go through some of those things, some of those principles, the first one is planning.
[00:19:15] And you know, we, this gets, of course everyone knows you got to come up with a plan.
[00:19:20] But do in a detailed map study and identifying the obstacles that you're going to have to get around.
[00:19:27] And there's a couple different methods that you can use for land navigation. One of them is called
[00:19:32] dead reckoning. And dead reckoning means you get a compass bearing. From point A to point B is,
[00:19:37] you know, you're going to be traveling on 270 degrees. So you put your compass on 270 degrees
[00:19:42] and you march. You go straight line. Don't let anything take you off that line. Head down and go.
[00:19:48] And that's called dead reckoning. And that's obviously can be very problematic. Because if in
[00:19:54] between you and where you're going is a giant mountain or you know, a bunch of rivers or whatever
[00:19:58] you're going to have to go through all those things and you're going to get worn out, you're
[00:20:02] tired, you might be not tactically advisable to go through those areas. And so the better form
[00:20:10] is called terrain Nav or terrain association. And when you're doing that, you actually look at
[00:20:16] the map and you study what the ground is going to do. And so if there's a big mountain, you can
[00:20:22] screw around the bottom of the mountain and you get to the side of the mountain and there's a
[00:20:26] ravine that's you can follow that ravine around till you get to a certain point on the ravine where
[00:20:30] it cuts far to the north and you can you can head any other direction towards your turn. So it's
[00:20:35] this, it's a method of really knowing the terrain that you're going to be on. And it's infinitely
[00:20:41] more effective than dead reckoning. So if you think about this from my perspective over you have
[00:20:46] a mission that you're trying to get done. Well, how are you going to get there? You know, how
[00:20:50] are you going to get this mission done? Are you going to just put your head down and absorb any
[00:20:57] impact that you take and apply more pressure? Or are you going to be smart? Are you going to study
[00:21:02] the terrain and take a look and figure out the best way around those obstacles?
[00:21:11] Those dead reckoning and terrain association, the terrain association, you don't like, let's
[00:21:19] say go around the mountain and then try to get back on the dead reckoning course. You're just using
[00:21:23] the terrain. Your brain is the terrain level. You'll know when you do your map study,
[00:21:28] you'll know that you're going to go skirt around this mountain. You're going to go down a
[00:21:32] ravine, then you're going to cut over by this open field. You're going to hold along the wood
[00:21:36] lines. When you get to the end of the wood line, there's going to be a fence. You're going to
[00:21:41] step over that fence once you get to the fence. You're going to follow the fence for, you know,
[00:21:45] until you hit another big terrain feature like another hill. Then you're going to follow the
[00:21:53] base of that hill until you get to a stream. You're going to know exactly where you're going the
[00:21:58] whole time. You're going to imagine how much more effective this is. You don't have to look at
[00:22:02] your compass. You are taking advantage. You're going to patrol in areas where you have a tactical
[00:22:07] advantage too. It's just a much, much better way to do things. A lot of times I think people
[00:22:13] know they hear the big, the big Navy seal. Like, oh, we're just going to get it done.
[00:22:21] Yes, they just stay on the course, right? Well, staying on the course means I'm going to reach my
[00:22:26] objective. It doesn't mean I'm going to power my head into the wall without thinking. So
[00:22:33] that's what terrain features do for you. And there's also some terrain features that are
[00:22:39] interesting. You can use reference points that keep you from going too far. So you can know,
[00:22:46] hey, if we hit this main highway, we went too far. We know we missed our target. We missed our turn.
[00:22:51] If we hit this river, we know we went too far. If we hit this ridge line, we know we hit
[00:22:55] too far. So you're going to set those up for you. And they're going to confirm where you are
[00:23:01] and also you're going to use those as reference points. So you're going to tell your whole team.
[00:23:04] So your whole team is going to know, hey, we made it this far. Oh, there's the big river that
[00:23:11] we're turning left at. Okay, we turned left. That's awesome. Next, we're going to hit is a wood bind.
[00:23:16] Oh, here's the wood bind. So everybody knows. And so imagine if you're, again, think about this
[00:23:23] outside the, the parameters of land navigation and patrolling. Think of it in a regular business
[00:23:28] or any situation when you're trying to get a team to do something. If you lay out the course
[00:23:32] for them and you plot out what the obstacles are and you explain to people where they're going to be
[00:23:36] and how, how important it is that they need to get there and what we need to be looking out for.
[00:23:41] Imagine how the team feels. The team knows where they are. They understand where they are.
[00:23:46] When you're doing dead reckoning, the back of the, the guys in the back, they have no idea where
[00:23:50] they are. I've been that guy. I've been that guy in the back of the of a patrol and you just have
[00:23:54] no idea where you are. You have no idea how much further to go. You just got your head down.
[00:23:58] You're, you're slugging along with your weight and it's a nightmare. Whereas I've been on good
[00:24:03] patrols when I'm in the back, but we got a really good brief and I'm like, oh, there's that mountain.
[00:24:07] Oh, there's that ravine. Okay, where should be coming at that stream soon? Oh, yes, we're at the
[00:24:11] stream. So you know where you are and when you provide your team with that kind of clarity
[00:24:15] on the course that you're planning to take, it's going to make them so much more aware of what's
[00:24:20] happening and the more aware they are of what's happening. The better performance you're going to get from them.
[00:24:24] Yeah. The other thing is as you're doing this, you do something called a pace count, which is
[00:24:32] your as you walk, you know how many paces it takes you to get 100 yards. And there's some
[00:24:38] Kentucky windages there as a walk when we're going uphill or downhill, you can, you can work
[00:24:42] out these different, but you can get pretty accurate. So you can know that, hey, when I take
[00:24:47] left, when my left foot hits the ground, on average, when I'm wearing a hundred pounds,
[00:24:50] it's 86 paces from the average one hundred yards. So that's, that's, you'll know that. And so
[00:24:56] then what you're doing is you're constantly checking, it gives you another, it gives you another
[00:25:01] reference point because if we're supposed to hit, you know, a stream in 300 yards and I know we've
[00:25:10] marked 600 yards, something happened, time for me to stop. In fact, at 400 yards, I'm probably
[00:25:15] going to stop and say, okay, let's do a quick map study. So you want to double check these things
[00:25:19] in a business world. This could be some kind of a timeline that you set up. So you're like, hey,
[00:25:23] at, you know, 42 days, we should be here on this project. Oh, we're not there yet. Okay,
[00:25:29] what's the problem? What did we miss? Why aren't we getting it done? So that gives you two sort of
[00:25:36] methodologies to confirm where you are, so you can triangulate your position, which is smart.
[00:25:41] Wait, when you call it Kentucky what? Kentucky windage. What does that mean? It's like the
[00:25:46] give or take? It's, you know, it's just, it comes from shooting. Okay, and you would normally
[00:25:52] dial in your site to get you specifically. Let's say you, you think 600 meters, but then there's a
[00:25:58] strong wind blowing. So maybe you're going to hold off to the left of the windy and Kentucky or something.
[00:26:04] I think it's just shooting. The, the, maybe the shooters in Kentucky had a, they made it. They
[00:26:10] were real accurate. So they had a whole little Kentucky wind got a commentate for that. Yeah, got you.
[00:26:15] Chicago windage. No. No. Well, because it's kind of windy, you know, so yeah, I see you're
[00:26:21] coming from, but no. It's, it's, it's Kentucky windage. It's my brozinho. Pretty dope. So,
[00:26:30] like I said in life, plan, study the route that you're going to go, think about the obstacles,
[00:26:35] how are you going to avoid them, what do your goals look like, what do your smaller goals look like,
[00:26:40] along the way, the little reference points. So you got some of you signs of the big project.
[00:26:44] Okay, what are the little things? Or you got something in your life that you're trying to accomplish?
[00:26:48] What are the little goals you're going to set for yourself to you and get to keep a reference point
[00:26:51] along the way? And what's the timeline you're going to meet those on? Yep. That's how you stay on track.
[00:26:57] And you know what, we actually did. We did something called pace notes. And what pace notes were,
[00:27:03] and I learned it for, for foot patrols. And we ended up using it even more when it came to vehicle
[00:27:11] patrols. And I realized that, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago or something, we started sending
[00:27:16] guys to a rally driving school. So I could learn how to drive rally racing cars. And that's,
[00:27:23] that's been the way they always done pace notes in rally racing. So you, so what's cool about it is
[00:27:28] when you do pace notes, you're writing down specifically, this is the terrain feature,
[00:27:32] this is what I'm seeing, this is how far away it is. This is the next terrain feature,
[00:27:35] this is what I'm going to see, this is how far away it is. So you can actually track that. Now,
[00:27:39] we got so detailed with that on vehicle mount patrols. We would actually just take the map and
[00:27:46] blow the map up so we'd see exactly what it looked like at that intersection or at that juncture or
[00:27:52] at that city block so we could see what the buildings look like so we'd be looking for it.
[00:27:57] So that's pace notes and it, and it, it's almost like a rehearsal, you know, it's almost like a rehearsal
[00:28:01] because you can, you can walk the whole team through and they can get a visualization of what
[00:28:06] they're going to see and how it's going to look. And the other, the other piece is that I said,
[00:28:12] is you've got to share that plan and explain it to everybody so every time the same sheet.
[00:28:16] And, and I did this, what I explained to my kids, you know what I said, okay, here's what we're going
[00:28:21] to see. We're at this area here. We're going to go across some flat ground. We're going to start
[00:28:24] hitting some little terrain features here. It's going to go up and down and up and down. That's
[00:28:27] going to tell us that we're here. And, not only does it help them, no, it's going on, but now I'm talking
[00:28:33] through it. And that helps me because it helps to teach things because when you teach something,
[00:28:37] you become more proficient at it. That's one of the good things about teaching anything. You know,
[00:28:42] you want to get better at something, teach people how to do it. It makes you better. You want to teach
[00:28:46] that arm lock or you want to get better at the arm lock, teach the arm lock, you'll notice all kinds
[00:28:49] little details about it. But it's so hard to teach. Like if you're not used to teaching,
[00:28:53] you should jump in there and teach because you're just used to doing it. And a lot of that stuff
[00:28:56] you just do without thinking about, okay, what exactly am I doing in this detail? You just do it.
[00:29:00] Let me, you know, muscle memory. And like, this is all these little factors that facilitate you
[00:29:05] doing something that you don't even think about. And then try to teach you, you're like, oh, you kind of
[00:29:09] do this. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, you know, you didn't even know what you're saying. You know,
[00:29:13] Greg Train always throws out little details. Like, oh, that's a good little right. Yeah. That I,
[00:29:17] and he has something that I do, but once he points it out or teaches it, he'll be teaching
[00:29:21] something basic that I know and I'm good at. Yeah. And he'll say, oh, yeah, I did. I put my foot on the
[00:29:27] hip here to stabilize this and I go, oh, I do that. But when you start thinking about it and you
[00:29:31] focus on it, it makes you that much better at it. And that's the same thing that's going to happen
[00:29:37] here. When you actually brief your team and tell them exactly what to expect. Now again, this doesn't
[00:29:42] mean that you're going to say, hey, this is what exactly how it's going to go because you got to
[00:29:45] give the caveat that, hey, this is our plan. I worried about how to deviate from this plan. And that's
[00:29:49] okay. We're ready to do that. We're adaptive. Yeah. But when you talk through it, it helps you and it helps them.
[00:29:55] Yeah. That's funny. Greg Train is a reason I ran into use like he's teaching whatever and then he
[00:30:02] just all of a sudden bus out. Hey, I'll teach him that move that you do. Now, it was pretty good at that
[00:30:06] move. I started teaching. It's like, it's like, it's a guard pass that I do sometime. And
[00:30:12] Brian, teaching, I don't even know what I'm talking about. I'm like doing it all good, but
[00:30:15] and everyone's like, oh, all right, you know, I'm a poor teacher. Well, that's something you can
[00:30:21] work on, I guess, starting now, take over the podcast. I'm more comfortable avoiding it.
[00:30:28] Awesome. Now, now the next piece that I was thinking about on patrolling and that I saw my kids go
[00:30:36] through and that I went through as a young seal is you start questioning or you start going through
[00:30:42] this process. If what do I need to bring with me? What do I actually need to bring with me? Now,
[00:30:49] when you don't have to carry it, when you don't know what it means to carry it. Carry it. When I say
[00:30:55] carry, I mean, put it on your back and bear the weight of that item. When you don't have to do that,
[00:31:01] you want to carry everything. Yeah. I'll just carry everything, the warm sleeping bag and the
[00:31:05] whisper light stove and the extra food and the comfort gear and all this stuff. That's what you do
[00:31:11] when you when you don't have to carry it, oh, you don't think about carrying it or you don't know what
[00:31:14] it feels like to carry it. But when you have to carry it, you get down to what you need real quick.
[00:31:22] To what you actually need real quick, totally limited on the food. You're not going to be. I never,
[00:31:31] I never heated a meal in the field. Unless it was like snow on the ground, a winter warfair scenario,
[00:31:38] never heated a meal in the ground. If it was never, never heated a meal because that means you had to
[00:31:45] bring a fuel and a whisper light and all this stuff. And I never, I was a radioman. So I had to already carry a
[00:31:51] radio and then I got used to that. So by the time I was an officer and I wasn't carrying a radio anymore,
[00:31:56] I said, I'm just going to be lighter than everybody else. Yeah. Comfort gear? No, we won't take that.
[00:32:05] And you need to get it. You need to bring enough comfort gear that you can actually sleep and survive.
[00:32:11] I mean, you need to bring a ground pattern, whatever. But we used to say,
[00:32:17] little saying, let's travel light, freeze it night. That was my saying for sure, travel
[00:32:21] life, freeze it night. And I'll tell you, I got my indoctrination to freezing at night and
[00:32:29] traveling light when I first checked into the team. I went to a comm school, communication school,
[00:32:36] a seal communications school. So you're going to be blown out of the radio in this yield teams.
[00:32:41] And I had this, this old chief that was running the, uh, running the, running the training.
[00:32:48] And I was a fired up new guy. I didn't even have my tried it. So I was just brand new guy.
[00:32:52] Didn't even have my try knows at the team and they sent me to this school. And so this chief and I
[00:32:56] actually went with another new guy, who's, who's a great guy. And we went out there,
[00:33:01] told them, you guys, neither one of us had our try. It's we had graduated from Buds a couple months ago,
[00:33:05] or from airborne school, whatever. So we showed up at the winter time. And we show up in, and the
[00:33:10] end of this school, you go through a field training exercise. And it's, I want to say it's five days in
[00:33:18] the field. It's like Monday through Friday in the field or something along those lines.
[00:33:22] And you are basically doing the reconnaissance mission. And they give you really good targets to look at.
[00:33:28] And you're going to look at, and you're going to report back with all this information. And then you're
[00:33:31] going to move, they're going to move you every couple hours. They give you directions to a new point to move to.
[00:33:37] So we're doing, we're, we're getting ready for this FTX. And I'd never spent much time in the field.
[00:33:43] And the guy that's running the course, you know, he's having fun with the new guy. And he's like, hey,
[00:33:48] well, Link. And I said, yes, chief, and he goes, you know what, you think you're hard to
[00:33:52] call him? I go, I'm trying to be hard, core. And he says, if you're really hard to call, you don't need
[00:33:57] a punch. You don't need a sleeping bag or a ground pad. You just go out there with a punch.
[00:34:02] I want a punch, a lighter. And I was like, okay, no problem. So sure enough, I go in the field of the
[00:34:10] punch, I want a punch, a lighter. And actually, actually, it was a bivisac, which is a Gore text. It's
[00:34:17] like a Gore text sleeping bag, just a thin Gore text shell. And a punch, a liner, which is something that's
[00:34:23] been around forever. And it's just a very thin, thin, like basically blanket. No, it's not even
[00:34:30] 10. It's like a blanket. It's like a blanket. That's what it is. It's a liner. It's a very thin,
[00:34:34] it's yes, it's a very thin liner. It's what is the punch, a liner. And so I had those
[00:34:40] and the two things I had with me. And my buddy took the same. So we were like, oh, oh, that you
[00:34:47] need to be like, that's a hard core. Go, I'm hard core. How cold was it? Like, so we are going into
[00:34:53] the field. We're inserting in the field. And the sun is going like we inserted right at dusk,
[00:34:58] as we're inserting in the field, it's raining. Right as we get on the ground, it turns to sleep.
[00:35:04] And then two hours into the night, it turns into snow. So we freeze. I mean, we freeze. We're just,
[00:35:15] we can't sleep. And the funny thing was was that we couldn't sleep. We literally couldn't sleep.
[00:35:21] It was too cold for us to sleep. And the guy had set it up. So you had to make a communications.
[00:35:26] When you had to make communications, it was about every three or four hours. And so,
[00:35:32] and if you missed a communications window, if you missed it, that was, you know, you got,
[00:35:36] you grade went down or whatever you got points subtracted. So all the other guys who were
[00:35:42] experienced seals that knew how to live out in the field better than we did, they all were super comfortable.
[00:35:48] They all went out there and had sleeping bags, ground pads, and all that. And they slept through
[00:35:53] their com windows. At least some of them, they didn't sleep through all of them. Obviously, but occasionally
[00:35:56] it's sleep, they went after four days, three days, whatever. And so we were the only pair that made
[00:36:02] all of our com windows because we couldn't. Right? Good. You know, yeah, we'd just be standing up,
[00:36:08] just standing up, standing by a tree, doing burpees. Just trying to, trying to survive. Yeah.
[00:36:14] So that was, that was one of the lessons on learning how to travel light freezing night.
[00:36:20] That was a little too much. I should, the thing I needed was a ground pad.
[00:36:24] Do you need a ground pad when you go in the field? So travel light freezing night is kind of like a warning
[00:36:29] or is that like, no, it's a deal. That's what you do. Oh, yeah. It was my methodology and it's a methodology of
[00:36:36] a portion of guys in the military that are, that are on the, it would rather be on the hard side.
[00:36:43] Right. So I'm going to also all freeze at night so I can travel light freezing night.
[00:36:47] You're going to be more effective when you're, when you're lighter. Yeah.
[00:36:50] I mean, of course, if you're exhausted, that's why that's why there's got to be a balance there.
[00:36:54] We should have brought ground pads on that operation to that training operation for sure.
[00:36:59] Yeah. Because we're going to freeze. And like we got trench foot legit and the guy that was with me
[00:37:05] had legit trench foot when he got out. Like what is that like front bike? No, it's when your feet
[00:37:09] because this part of this, part of this training operation took place in, in like a swamp.
[00:37:14] Oh, dang. So it's freezing in the swamp and he got legit World War One style trench foot.
[00:37:21] I had it too. My not as bad as him. But what is that? It's just your feet get numb and
[00:37:26] rodded and jacked up. Yeah. Good times. So, so again, how do we apply this to life? And I think
[00:37:36] if you, if you look at what you want versus what you actually need. And imagine if you had to
[00:37:45] carry everything that you owned. Now, of course, that's not possible. But I think this is this whole
[00:37:53] like minimalist attitude that's that's kind of getting popular right now that it's getting popular
[00:37:59] in civilian world right now. But in the military, we've always valued that and that's one of the
[00:38:03] cool things about going away on deployment. For me, I always love this feeling when you went away
[00:38:10] on deployment. You could only take, and we as Seals took a lot of gear with us, but there's a limit.
[00:38:16] You took, you know, five or six kit bags, you know, five or six big, duffel bags basically
[00:38:22] filled with gear. And that's it. That's it. That's all your gear. That's all the gear you have. And so,
[00:38:27] honestly, to me, that that always felt good. That is what I got. This is everything I have. And,
[00:38:33] you know, as a young seal, that was basically you could fit all your gear in those six bags. And
[00:38:38] then everything you own in the civilian world, you could fit in two more bags. And we live that,
[00:38:42] like I live like that with my buddies back in the day. We live like that for a long time. Oh,
[00:38:46] you, we can go to the point tomorrow. We can just put all of our stuff at home and get back. We can
[00:38:50] blow our stuff up a week. We ready to go. Yeah. Kind of like we're the military guys. You're kind of like
[00:38:56] the OG minimalist. Yeah. Back in the day. It's good. And we've got to teach Sarah this stuff. Yeah,
[00:39:03] well, people start to hold on to stuff. Especially the part where if, or when you carry it,
[00:39:08] you realize how much stuff, you know, that part where you're talking about, once you know the weight
[00:39:12] of your own stuff, you think twice before. Yeah, yeah. And it's really, really, it starts thinking about
[00:39:17] the cost of that gear. And what does that mean over time? And how much of usage are you going to
[00:39:21] get out of it? Now, the thing that I hang on to, there's a couple of things that I'm a little bit of a
[00:39:25] hoarder on. One of these T-shirts. Yeah, I'm not mad at them. Now, some people might be thinking,
[00:39:32] hey, Jocco, you wear the same freaking T-shirts. They're saying they which is true. Yeah. But I have,
[00:39:38] you know, old T-shirts that are just, I just, I just, I, because I wear my T-shirts a lot when I
[00:39:45] wear them. It's hard for me to part with them. Brad, better than that than shoot. You're like the, I have, I have,
[00:39:51] I have a ton of old Jiu Jitsu T-shirts. Yeah. When I used to go to schools, I used to travel
[00:39:55] in a school. Yeah. Yeah. And they'd give me a T-shirt. Yeah. And I have all these old school
[00:39:59] T-shirts of schools that don't even exist or of schools that got really big or whatever,
[00:40:03] or just competitions that I did, you know, and you got those school T-shirts. Yeah. And I'm not,
[00:40:07] I don't wear them anymore, but I can't. I was thinking, you know what I could do is inventory them,
[00:40:12] take pictures of them, and put them on the inner webs, and then throw them away.
[00:40:16] Wouldn't be, oh, like, like, like an archive. Yeah. Yeah. Because because there's some,
[00:40:20] it triggers memories that are, yeah. Yeah. It's like memory, be-lea. Yeah. It's basically smart cards.
[00:40:24] Because you like to, it triggers the memory of those times of that event, or whatever.
[00:40:30] Because otherwise you're not thinking about it. And there's a problem with that. I'll tell you,
[00:40:33] I realize this from my experience growing up, you know, I grew up in New England, and I don't
[00:40:39] go home, didn't go home at all. They hardly ever go back to the town where I grew up.
[00:40:44] Mm-hmm. And the people that I know that are still there, they remember all this stuff.
[00:40:48] From when we were kids, they remember this event. That remember when this happened,
[00:40:52] and I honestly don't remember. I just don't remember it. Yeah.
[00:40:57] And I think the reason is because I went away from there, and I never went back,
[00:41:02] and so I have nothing triggering those members. I don't see the school yard where the fight happened.
[00:41:07] And I don't see the road where the car flipped. I don't see that stuff.
[00:41:11] And so I don't remember it like they do. They're there all the time. Oh yeah, I remember when
[00:41:16] Little Johnny gave, you know, you know, it's like no, I actually don't remember that.
[00:41:20] So with some of this memory of Bilias, as you called it,
[00:41:24] if every time I look at it, I go, oh yeah, that was cool. Turned it. Well, that was cool.
[00:41:28] Training with those guys or whatever. So I have a bunch of just two teachers that I have an
[00:41:32] artifact getting apart. That's how. Partly, right. Yeah. I was taking them to the gym and framing them
[00:41:38] and hanging them up. You're a ghost. No, not you're a ghost. No, not you're a ghost. But they're
[00:41:42] old school teachers. They'd be cool to have those old students. And if you if you got my
[00:41:46] teacher, it's being T-shirts, Jeff and Glovers T-shirts and put them up there. That means sick.
[00:41:50] Yeah. Or you're on the other side of the poster. Remember best of the West? Remember that turn
[00:41:53] a bit. Yeah. That was a good one. It's just gone. Yeah. So that's it. You go through this checklist back
[00:42:04] to the subject here. You go through this checklist of what you actually need. And again, when you're
[00:42:08] when you're in a business, you've got to look at what you what what do you need to complete this
[00:42:11] operation? What do you just want? Because it'd be nice to have and separate those things, separate
[00:42:17] those things. You can actually put them in those categories. You know, need want nice to have,
[00:42:23] right? And then you go through. Okay. Let's let's concentrate on what we need first. And then we can see
[00:42:28] if there's anything that we want. And then by the way, if there's a nice to have, we can throw in
[00:42:31] their okay. Fine. But to go in there and just buy everything on that list or command everything on that
[00:42:38] list, because you think you're going to need it? No wrong answer. Well, move. Yeah. And a lot of times
[00:42:42] people and of course, I'm not talking about maybe it or it does apply to business, but just in life
[00:42:48] what you need and what you want. You know, a lot of times what you want doesn't even facilitate
[00:42:54] what you need. You know, like you'd be like, oh, hey, I don't need faster internet, but I kind of
[00:42:59] want it. But the faster internet is going to facilitate my work. Well, let's say you do, you know,
[00:43:03] you need to do it. At least that's something sometimes people will get stuff that they want.
[00:43:10] That's just straight up no function. Yeah. Oh, yeah. For sure. Not my family.
[00:43:15] I know. I don't like things about function. I know. Like them. Don't like them. Um, okay. So,
[00:43:26] so again, back to this, once you've decided on what you're going to bring or what you're going to
[00:43:31] need, then time to start the operation. It's time to start this movement. And even when the
[00:43:37] start, you got to check confirm where you are, make sure you know, then you get started. And I had this
[00:43:42] first reminder when I did this little patrol with my kids because I just and I were going to go.
[00:43:46] It's a little trail. It's start walking. We started walking. I didn't keep a pace count.
[00:43:51] That's ridiculous. That's embarrassing to admit. Didn't keep a pace count. I know
[00:43:54] wasn't really paying attention. We were just kind of talking and having, yeah, we're just talking
[00:44:01] and moving and kind of getting used to it all and hey, how's your backpack feeling, all that stuff?
[00:44:05] And I'll also know, I go wait a second. Where are we? Where are we right now?
[00:44:11] Because I had told them that hey, we're going to be looking for the trail that goes up. And
[00:44:16] we talked through it. And we pulled out the map, and we started doing a little study. And my son was
[00:44:20] like immediately with, oh, we went too far. We missed it. I know what it's back there. And my daughter
[00:44:26] wouldn't commit either way. And I said, okay, let's do an assessment. And so we assessed and realized
[00:44:31] that we actually hadn't gone quite far enough. So we went a little bit further. But my point is that
[00:44:37] you got to check yourself. You got to check yourself and check your team consistently, not constantly.
[00:44:45] Right. That's micro management, but consistently. And you also have to watch out for target
[00:44:52] fixation, which is trying to go too fast. I go, you're just trying to get to that to the end
[00:44:57] point without going by your little waypoints along the way. That is a way to get yourself lost.
[00:45:03] Because you're driving and you're not looking for your reference points. And you'll lose the
[00:45:09] bubble. So you got to detach a little bit and stand back and pay attention and not be all crazy
[00:45:15] about that. You know, for you know, every 500 meters, maybe every, you do a quick check. Every
[00:45:22] thousand meters, you're going to do a little bit of more accurate study. And that's going to keep you
[00:45:31] and line. And if you are out of line, you're only going to be a little bit off track. You're not
[00:45:37] going to be 12 days of work or two hours of walking off track. Yeah, it makes perfect sense. Too
[00:45:45] especially going by all these reference points. The target fixation, you're just, you got one reference
[00:45:50] point. And it's probably not even that accurate because really just by the nature of the whole deal,
[00:45:54] the map, the one reference point that you do have is the furthest thing away. Literally.
[00:45:58] So you only have that one or for that. If you have all these other reference points, you get off track
[00:46:03] one step, two steps, three steps. You still got like a bunch of reference points. Just like,
[00:46:07] all right, let's backtrack all these reference points. You're good to do. There to support you.
[00:46:10] That's, that's how you do it. And that's again, that's when you're planning something with a team
[00:46:14] and a business. You got to have some reference points along the way. To help you get towards your goal.
[00:46:19] Yeah. Because your goal is far off in the distance. So you got to plan about how you're going to get there.
[00:46:25] If you have a video or use photo shoppers, it has, this, when I first started, it has this history
[00:46:35] little box. So every movie, make it records it. That's pretty cool. Delete, delete, and then you
[00:46:39] have control at which is saved. But that's something else. But yeah, each one. So you can literally
[00:46:46] go, oh wait, it's reference point with every single move. That's awesome. So you can go up.
[00:46:50] Oh, let me go all the way back, you know, 25 moves to when I erase this little thing. Boop.
[00:46:56] Let me start from there. You know, you bring one thing back that's far up the chart. Yeah.
[00:47:01] Here's the only thing. It's like, but it's like a little, like a fork kind of. So like, let's say you go back
[00:47:05] in time essentially. You go back like five moves. And then you make a different move. It, that one
[00:47:11] discourse. Yeah, it's gone. That's why in time travel. Yeah, exactly. It's time to time travel.
[00:47:17] All right. So when you get out on patrol now, um, disciplines paramount. Sure.
[00:47:25] For instance, you got to stay hydrated. You got to keep track of your gear. You got to keep track of your
[00:47:29] pace count. You don't let your gear get out. You don't take out your gear. Like, oh, stop for seconds.
[00:47:34] I'm just going to pull everything out of my Bruxac and lay it all over the place. No, you got to keep it tight.
[00:47:40] You don't rush over obstacles. So for instance, oh, you know, there's a little log. And I got
[00:47:47] to see there's a log going across this trail. And I got to step over the log. Well, I step up on top of it.
[00:47:52] And then I'm just going to jump off because I, it's a little easier. No, you don't just jump off because
[00:47:56] that's how you spray your ankle. That's how you blow out an E, which is, you know, what you're playing
[00:48:00] a basketball game or you're on the Jiu-Jitsu mat and you twist your ankle. Cool. Walk to the side,
[00:48:07] put some ice on it. Your, you know, 10 kilometers out in the middle of nowhere and one of your
[00:48:16] kids spraying an ankle. You're in trouble. Yeah. You're in trouble. And if you're out on patrol
[00:48:23] in a military situation and you get somebody that gets spraying ankle, you're even more
[00:48:28] significant trouble. So you got to have the discipline to slow down, slow as moods, moods,
[00:48:35] fast, watch your footing, watch for danger. Watch your field of fire. Pay attention to the first
[00:48:40] person that's in front of you and the person that's behind you. And that's how you're doing
[00:48:47] your communication. So you gotta keep your communication up the whole time. So again, you can go
[00:48:50] right to any business, any project that anyone's working on. It's all the same thing. You gotta be disciplined.
[00:48:56] You gotta keep track of things. You gotta keep your communication going between your team
[00:49:01] members by passing whatever signals you gotta pass when you get to a layup point.
[00:49:08] When you're gonna actually stop and basically camp out, I hate saying that.
[00:49:12] Because in the in the in the in the sealed teams, it's derogatory to say,
[00:49:15] oh, right. It's kind of an upside. Yeah. Yeah. So you never want to have anybody say that.
[00:49:19] So I wouldn't let my when I won't control my kids. I was like, no, we're not camping. We're
[00:49:23] in a layup point. But so you guys are camping out. No, we're not. So this,
[00:49:28] well, when you get to a layup point where you're gonna stop, you don't just flop down and turn into
[00:49:35] a pile of crap. And this is true. Again, with a business situation, you reach one goal. You don't just
[00:49:42] like flop down and say, oh, we did it high five office party. No, you can you can order pizza,
[00:49:50] maybe, but you're not ordering booze. You know what I'm saying? You still got stuff to do. So you don't
[00:49:55] camp out. You have to remain tact or you have to remain disciplined. You have to quietly assume
[00:50:01] your security position. You got to then be quiet and make sure you are as alone as you think you are.
[00:50:07] Then you got to pick out some landmarks. Once you get to your little layup point,
[00:50:10] you got to you got to make that your home. You know, you got to look at for some landmarks or some
[00:50:16] somewhere where you know where you are. And then you confirm your position. You know, you take a
[00:50:21] triangulation with your compass, maybe even break out your GPS, get a little double confirmation.
[00:50:27] And then once you've got everything set, then you can take a little breather. But what you don't do is
[00:50:32] get to the finish line and just flop down and we made it. You never want to do that. And the other
[00:50:38] piece, this is something I found about a lot while I was on this patrol with my with my two kids.
[00:50:42] I went with two out of the four kids. When that we kind of have a standard in most militarys do this,
[00:50:50] you're going to when you're when you're doing a patrol, you're going to move for 50 minutes.
[00:50:54] You're going to walk for 50 minutes and you're going to rest for 10. Then you walk for 15,
[00:50:58] rest for 10. Walk for 15. That's kind of the standard. And I can tell you that if you aren't careful,
[00:51:06] it can be hard to start up again. And you get tired legs and you get sore shoulders and you get
[00:51:13] hunger and you get thirsty and it's easy to let 10 minutes turn into 15 minutes and turn into 20
[00:51:20] minutes and turn into a half an hour. That can happen very, very easily. And this is the thing you
[00:51:27] gotta remember. While you are resting, you are getting no closer to your target. There is no progress
[00:51:38] that is being made. And by the way, the only person that is going to move you toward that target is you.
[00:51:51] You're the only person that's going to move you towards that target. You're not going to get
[00:51:55] carried. The target's not going to move to you. You are the only person that's going to move to the
[00:51:59] target. And if you don't move, you'll never get there. And the faster you get there, the better off,
[00:52:04] you're going to be. Now again, this doesn't mean that you're simply grinding yourself and your
[00:52:09] team into the dirt. There are rest periods involved there. You have 10 minutes of rest. You have 50 minutes
[00:52:14] of work. So I'm not talking about smashing your team. But you absolutely do have to drive your team
[00:52:23] because there will be no progress in the comfort zone. There will not. In the inside the comfort zone,
[00:52:31] there's no progress happening. There's nothing happening. And when you're patrolling with a rucksack
[00:52:40] on, it is not comfortable. It's not comfortable. It's not comfortable. It's not easy. And that is one
[00:52:45] of the things. That's why this discipline of keeping moving and continuing to push the pace is so
[00:52:52] powerful. And that's the same thing with any goal. Obviously, the correlation here is that any goal that
[00:53:01] you're going for, you have to keep moving toward it. You have to stay on the path. Do you have to
[00:53:09] rest? Yes. But you have to go. You have to go down that path. And that is another one of these
[00:53:18] principles and all these principles. They really applied everything that I did in my
[00:53:25] seal career. Regardless of what I was doing. The same things, planning well, setting goals,
[00:53:31] knowing what they looked like, staying disciplined on everything on every type of mission, on every
[00:53:37] task, every job. That is what I always did. I didn't take it easy. Did I rest? Sure. Of course,
[00:53:46] I rested. But did I cut corners? Did I take the easy way? Did I slack off? No. No, I did not. I held the line.
[00:54:02] Now, from a leadership perspective, all this talk of marching and patrolling made me think of a
[00:54:15] short story called The Beloved Captain, which I was recently introduced to by the wife of one of
[00:54:25] the finest leaders I've ever worked for. A guy named General Sean McFarlane, who was the
[00:54:32] Colonel at the time who was commanding the one one AD. The first brigade in the first armored division
[00:54:38] otherwise known as the ready first during the Battle of Ramadi. And I recently saw General McFarlane's
[00:54:46] wife at a memorial event that we did for the 10 year anniversary of Mark Lee's death. She told me about
[00:54:58] this story. Again, it's called The Beloved Captain and it lays out some fundamental leadership
[00:55:06] principles. And when the General's wife told me that he kind of referred to this story himself
[00:55:14] for guidance, I figured maybe the kind of guidance we could all use. And the story is written by a
[00:55:23] guy named Donald Hanky, who served with the British Army in World War I, a volunteer who enlisted
[00:55:34] at age 29. Despite having served as an officer when he was younger, he enlisted to go fight
[00:55:44] and he eventually regained his commission. And in both as a enlisted guy as an and as an officer,
[00:55:53] he fought on the front lines. And he wrote this story, which is called as I said, the Beloved Captain.
[00:56:10] He came in the early days when we were still at recruit drills under hot September sun,
[00:56:16] tall, erect, smiling. So we first saw him and so he remained to the end. At the start,
[00:56:27] he knew as little of soldiering as we did. He used to watch us being drilled by the sergeant,
[00:56:32] but his manner of watching was peculiar to his own. He never looked bored. He was learning just as
[00:56:38] much as we were. In fact, more, he was learning his job. And from the first he saw that his job was
[00:56:46] more than to give us the correct orders. His job was to lead us. So he watched and noted many things
[00:56:56] and never found the time hang on heavy, heavy on his hands. He watched our evolutions so as to
[00:57:05] learn to learn the correct orders. He watched for the right manner of command, the manner which
[00:57:10] secured the most prompt response to an order. And he watched every one of us for our individual
[00:57:15] characteristics. We were his men. Already, he took an almost paternal interest in us. He noted the
[00:57:23] men who tried hard, but were naturally slow and awkward. He distinguished them from those who were
[00:57:30] inattentive and bored. He marked down the keen and most efficient among us. Most of all,
[00:57:36] he studied those who were subject to moods, who were sulky one day and willing the next.
[00:57:41] These were the ones who were to turn the scale. If he could get these on his side, the battle would
[00:57:50] be one. So here's this leader. Very important for him to learn about his men and know his men
[00:57:59] and study his men. We have heard this before. Back to the book. For the first few days, he just watched.
[00:58:09] Then he started work. He picked out some of the most awkward ones and a company by a corporal
[00:58:15] marched them away by themselves. In generously, he explained that he did not know much himself yet.
[00:58:21] But he thought that they might get on better if they drilled by themselves a bit and that if it
[00:58:27] helped them and they helped him, they would soon learn. So there's some serious humility going on there.
[00:58:34] He's like, hey, I don't know that much. You guys don't know that much. Let's help each other.
[00:58:38] Let's build a little team here. His confidence was infectious. He looked at them and they looked at
[00:58:44] him and the men pulled themselves together and determined to do their best. So he formed relationships here.
[00:58:55] Their best surprised themselves. His patience was inexhaustible. His simplicity could not fail to be
[00:59:04] understood. He's keeping them simple. So simple that they could not fail to be understood. His
[00:59:11] keenness and optimism carried all with them. Very soon, the awkward squad found themselves
[00:59:18] awkward no longer. And soon after that, they ceased to be a squad and went back to the platoon.
[00:59:24] Then he started to drill the platoon with a sergeant standing by to point out his mistakes. Of course,
[00:59:30] he made mistakes and when that happened, he never minded admitting it.
[00:59:37] Some extreme ownership going on. He would explain what mistakes he had made and try again.
[00:59:43] The result was that we began to take almost as much interest and pride in his progress as he did in
[00:59:50] ours. We were his men and he was our leader. We felt that he was a credit to us and we resolved to be a
[00:59:59] credit to him. There was a bond of mutual confidence and affection between us which grew stronger and
[01:00:06] stronger as the months passed. He had a smile for almost everyone but we thought he had a different
[01:00:13] smile for us. We looked for it and were never disappointed. On parade, as long as we were trying,
[01:00:21] his smile encouraged us. Off parade if we passed him and saluted, his eyes looked straight into our own
[01:00:27] and his smile greeted us. It was a wonderful thing that smile of his. It was something worth
[01:00:34] living for when worth working for. It bucked one up when one was bored or tired. It seemed to make one
[01:00:42] look at things from a different point of view, a finer point of view, his point of view. There was
[01:00:49] nothing feeble or weak about it. It was not monotonous like the smile of sunny gym. It meant something.
[01:00:59] It meant that we were his men and that he was proud of us and sure that we were going to do
[01:01:06] jolly well better than any of the other potuins and it made us determine that we would.
[01:01:12] When we failed him, when he was disappointed in us, he did not smile. He did not rage or curse.
[01:01:25] He just looked disappointed and that made us feel far more savage with ourselves than any amount of
[01:01:32] swearing would have done. Point we've talked about on here many times. That guy that's yelling and
[01:01:40] screaming, not getting respect. That has a lot to do. Probably everything to do. Also with remember
[01:01:49] who we were talking about, use the carrot nut to stick. That's basically on top of the bond or
[01:01:56] it could be a kind of the same thing. When they look for that approval, which we all do with our friends,
[01:02:02] especially, they're not looking to avoid him getting mad. They're looking to make them happy.
[01:02:09] Because of how that feels or how good that is. He doesn't have to get mad. He just has to
[01:02:15] basically go to zero. He doesn't have to go negative 10 on him. He goes to zero or one. They're like
[01:02:19] dang. I bet I'm going to get back to that 10. Yeah. And it's just great language. He just looked
[01:02:25] disappointed and that made us feel far more savage with ourselves than any amount of swearing would have
[01:02:32] done. And I had a boss like that one time. Our whole golden life was just to make him look good and
[01:02:42] have him say give us a smile and we're all fired up. Back to the book. He made us feel that we were
[01:02:51] not playing the game with him. This is if they messed up. He made us feel that we were not playing the
[01:02:55] game by him. It was not what he said. He was never very good at talking. It was just how he looked.
[01:03:04] And his look of displeasure and disappointment was a thing that we would do anything to avoid.
[01:03:10] The fact was that he had won his way into our affections. We loved him. And there isn't anything
[01:03:18] stronger than love when all said and done. He was humble too. If that is the right word and I think
[01:03:29] it is, no trouble of ours was too small for him to attend to. When we started root marches,
[01:03:37] for instance, and our feet were blistered and sore as they often were at first. You would have
[01:03:44] thought that they were his own feet from the trouble he took. Of course, after the march there
[01:03:50] was always an inspection of feet. That is routine. But with him, it was no mere routine. He came
[01:03:56] into our rooms and if anyone had a sore fit, foot, he would kneel down on the floor and look at it
[01:04:03] as carefully as if he had been a doctor. Then he would prescribe and the remedies were ready at hand
[01:04:10] being borne by the sergeant. If a blister had to be lanced, he would very likely lanced it himself
[01:04:16] then in there so as to make sure there was done with a clean needle and that no dirt was allowed to get in.
[01:04:24] There was no application about this, no striving after effect. There was simply that he felt that
[01:04:32] our feet were pretty important and that he knew that we were pretty careless. So he thought it best
[01:04:41] at the start to see to the matter himself. Nevertheless, there was an arise something almost
[01:04:48] religious about this care for our feet. It seemed to have a touch of the Christ about it and we loved
[01:04:55] and honored him the more. Literally getting down on his hands and knees and caring for the feet
[01:05:04] of his men. And you know, you can imagine the leaders that would see this as being beneath them
[01:05:14] and maybe even thinking in some way that this would make them look bad. But you can see obviously
[01:05:22] he's comparing him to Jesus. So I think it was a, I think it had a good effect on the men.
[01:05:35] We knew that we should lose him. For one thing, we knew that he would be promoted. It was our
[01:05:43] great hope that someday he would command the company. Also, we knew that he would be killed.
[01:05:52] He was so amazingly unself-conscious. For that reason, we knew that he would be absolutely fearless.
[01:06:02] He would be so keen on the job and hand and so anxious for his men that he would forget about his own
[01:06:08] danger. So it proved. He was a captain when we went out to the front. Whenever there was a tires
[01:06:16] and job to be done, he was there in charge. If ever there were a moment of danger, he was on the spot.
[01:06:25] If there were any particular part of the line where the shells were falling faster or the bombs
[01:06:31] dropping more thickly than in other parts, he was in it. It was not that he was conceited and
[01:06:37] imagined himself indispensable. It was just that he was so keen that the men should do their
[01:06:44] best and act worthy of the regiment. He knew that fellows hated turning out at night for fatigue
[01:06:52] when they were in a rest camp. He knew how tires in the long march there and back and digging in
[01:06:58] the dark for an unknown purpose were. He knew that the fellows would be inclined to growls and
[01:07:03] sure. So he thought that it was up to him to go and show them that he thought it was a job worth
[01:07:09] doing. And the fact that he was there put a new complexion on the matter altogether. No one would
[01:07:16] sure if he was there. No one would grumble so much either. What was good enough for him was good enough for us.
[01:07:23] So you got to get out there and you have told stories about picking up brass and doing the
[01:07:35] taking the bad watches, all those things. And this is a exact commentary about that. Just because
[01:07:44] you're in a leadership position doesn't mean you don't get to do the hard stuff or you don't have to
[01:07:48] do the hard stuff. It actually means you do the hard stuff. But I was talking to Jade. He did as
[01:07:55] ago. And, you know, he's the boss of his company and stuff. Man, that pretty much every word that's
[01:08:02] coming from that is like, man, it's reminding me of this where, like, this certain people in a group
[01:08:09] that can do that, that can go and like, you know, he'll wash your shoes and you don't, you don't
[01:08:13] automatically have that respect. And in some cases, you'll have less respect if like,
[01:08:20] sure, like they're kissing your butt and they don't have anything to look up to, you know, or,
[01:08:23] you know, these these kind of guys or whatever. But the point is as the leader or the boss or the
[01:08:30] dad or whatever. Like everyone in the group is watching you. People are watching. So if you're like,
[01:08:37] you can be like, hey, you can make 10, 20, 50 great moves. And then, but let's say you just kind of
[01:08:44] come in late every day or something like that or like you're disappointed. Yeah, they're watching.
[01:08:48] So they're like, okay, I see that. And they're not being critical necessarily. They're just watching.
[01:08:53] More odd thing. I'm sure you, I mean, they can go conscious or even subconscious. They could
[01:08:57] be, yeah, they could be getting critical. But man, they're watching. So when you're like,
[01:09:01] when, if they see slack off, they're like, uh, it's okay to slack off. Yeah, all right. Okay.
[01:09:07] Okay. Well, okay. That's what we're doing. You're needing, you know. Yeah. If you're from a leadership position,
[01:09:11] position, you're slacking. Your followers are going to slack. There's no doubt about it. Let there be no doubt.
[01:09:17] How are you lose your temper or even even if like you think no one's paying attention. You're like,
[01:09:22] you know, your kid is cruising with you, whatever you're on the phone with. I don't know. The
[01:09:25] cable guy and, you know, how they schedule the, you know, in your matter, whatever. I'll be there between nine a
[01:09:31] a, m, and nine p, m. I may have the next there or something. And he loses your temper on the cable guy.
[01:09:37] He's watching. You're like, oh, okay. That's kind of how it is. Like, that's how we do it.
[01:09:41] Kind of thing, you know, prep people watching. So yeah, this guy, where he's doing the hard stuff,
[01:09:47] you know, the top level stuff, bottom light he's doing it all. People are watching it and they see it.
[01:09:52] So they're like, man, that's the way to roll. I mean, literally something that they didn't think
[01:09:56] would digging in and move moving at night and digging in, you know, for an unknown purpose, they,
[01:10:02] they, he knew that they weren't fired up. As soon as he showed up and started doing it, they all
[01:10:05] realized, okay, if it's good enough for him. That's how we're rolling. It's good enough for us.
[01:10:10] They're back to the book. What was good enough for him was good enough for us. If it were not too much
[01:10:16] trouble for him to turn out, it was not too much trouble for us. He knew too how trying the nerves,
[01:10:24] how trying to the nerves it is to sit in a trench and be sheldered. He knew what a temptation there is
[01:10:31] to move a bit farther down the trench and herd together in a bunch at what seems the safest end.
[01:10:38] He knew too the folly of doing it and that there, that it was not the thing to do, not done in
[01:10:45] the best regiments. So he went along to see that it did not happen to see that the men stuck to their
[01:10:52] posts and conquered their nerves. And as soon as we saw him, we forgot our own anxiety.
[01:10:58] It was a bit further down, sir. We are all right here, but don't you go exposing yourself.
[01:11:05] We didn't matter. We knew it then. We were just rank and file bound to take risks. The company
[01:11:11] would get along all right without us, but the captain, how was the company to get on without him?
[01:11:18] To see him was to catch his point of view to forget our personal anxieties and think only of
[01:11:25] the company and the regiment and honor. That's an interesting concept.
[01:11:32] Is that your, this leader's presence actually opened his troopers minds to what he saw?
[01:11:44] That's awesome. There was not one of us, but would gladly have died for him.
[01:11:53] We longed for the chance to show him that. We weren't heroes. We never dreamed about getting the
[01:12:00] Victoria cross, but to save the captain, we would have earned it 10 times over.
[01:12:06] And never have cared a button whether we got it or not.
[01:12:12] We never got the chance. Worst luck. It was all the other way. We were holding some trenches,
[01:12:21] which were about as unhealthiest trenches could be. The boaches, which is a sling term for
[01:12:28] the Germans. The boaches were only a few yards away. And we're well supplied with trench mortars.
[01:12:36] We hadn't got any at the time. Bombs and air torpedoes were dropping round us all day.
[01:12:41] Of course, the captain was there. It seemed as if he could not keep away.
[01:12:47] A torpedo fell into the trench and buried some of our trap, chaps.
[01:12:51] The fellows next to them ran to dig them out. Of course, he was the first one.
[01:13:01] Then came another torpedo in the same place. That was the end.
[01:13:09] But he lives. Somehow he lives. And we who knew him do not forget.
[01:13:18] We feel his eyes on us. We still work for that wonderful smile of his.
[01:13:27] There are not many of the old lot left now, but I think those who went west have seen him.
[01:13:34] When they got to the other side, I think they were met.
[01:13:40] Someone said, well done, good and faithful servant. And as they knelt before, that gracious
[01:13:48] pierced figure, I reckon they saw nearby the captain's smile.
[01:13:56] Anyway, in that faith, let me die if death should come my way.
[01:14:03] And so, I think shall I die content.
[01:14:08] And die he did. Donald Hanky, who wrote that story was badly wounded in the battle
[01:14:29] leepers on July 30, 15 and after recovering from those wounds, he went back to the front, including action
[01:14:39] at the battle of the song. And later, preparing to go over the top at one, 30 in the afternoon,
[01:14:47] on October 12, 1916, Lieutenant Hanky, was reported to have told his men if wounded,
[01:15:00] blighty, if killed, resurrection. And blighty was a term that basically met million dollar
[01:15:10] wound, which we've talked about before on this podcast, the million dollar wound is
[01:15:15] how you get shot, it gets you off the front, but it doesn't kill you and it doesn't
[01:15:20] mean you for life. It's a million dollar wound and the brits called that a blighty. And so,
[01:15:25] at one, 30 in the afternoon, October 12, as his guys are getting ready to go over the top, he tells
[01:15:31] his men, if wounded blighty, if killed, resurrection. So you boys have nothing to fear.
[01:15:38] Shortly thereafter, he was killed. He is said to have been buried near the spot where he fell
[01:15:50] although the grave was never found. But we do have his words. So let us heed those words
[01:16:06] as we try to lead others as well as he did as well as we can as well as the beloved captain.
[01:16:18] With that, it's been some time since we've done some questions for the internet, so we can
[01:16:37] move to those questions. So it's good. After, after hearing a story like that,
[01:16:52] it's always tough for me to remember that when you hear one story like that,
[01:17:00] you've got to remember that there are thousands and thousands and thousands of stories like that
[01:17:10] of war and of leadership and of sacrifice. And if we don't do our damnedest to learn from those lessons
[01:17:26] and apply them, I question whether we even deserve to have this life.
[01:17:40] Yeah, about this story, be lovey captain. Yes.
[01:17:47] Like that's such a clear demonstration on how to be, where these guys would follow this guy
[01:17:52] basically into fire. They could probably watch him walk into a pit of fire and they don't follow.
[01:17:57] They did. Yeah. Think about it. They did. That's a world war one was. Yeah. Stand up. Go
[01:18:03] follow me. We're going to do this. Yeah. So if this guy's near presence can make
[01:18:11] these other guys follow him like that in these type of situations, like if more people would be
[01:18:16] like this guy, you know. In normal life, I mean, it'd be a breeze to have people, you know,
[01:18:24] listen to you and you guys get some stuff done and how much of the stuff that the beloved captain
[01:18:31] does is counter-intuitive of what people think of a military guy. I mean, almost everything in there,
[01:18:39] he's admitting his mistakes. He's figuring out who's awkward admitting to them that he's kind of
[01:18:46] messed up to. He's getting down on his knees and basically being almost submissive to his
[01:18:52] man in order to make sure that they're healthy. He's taking all the hard jobs. He's smiling
[01:18:59] and developing these strong relationships with his men. Like every one of those things is almost
[01:19:05] counter to what people think a big tough military leader is. The drill sergeant, the drill sergeant
[01:19:12] leader, like no. And so I see people in the civilian sector that end up in the same way. They think
[01:19:20] they think that that's how you lead because they've seen it in a movie. You know, that is not that
[01:19:25] that hyperaggressive mentality is ineffective with human beings. And actually, there's a question here
[01:19:35] where we'll probably talk about that some more. But that's why I always make it perfectly clear
[01:19:39] that I'm all about being aggressive. I'm all about being aggressive, but being aggressive towards
[01:19:44] your mission, not towards people. I mean, unless a person warrants aggressiveness, which does happen
[01:19:49] from time to time. That's called a fist fight. You know, far you noted where his mere presence
[01:19:59] kind of imp not imposed, but impacts their perspective, where it's like it's basically him walking
[01:20:06] in to whatever the situation. And them just kind of automatically, what's he seeing? Right. You know,
[01:20:11] they're so just kind of mean to him. Hey, let me move this weapon because he's a bad spot. Let me
[01:20:16] let me put it like this stuff up over here. That is completely right. Completely right. I was on a ship one
[01:20:21] time. And I thought I was about the commanding officer on a ship. There's something called the one
[01:20:27] MC, which is a basically loud speaker that goes throughout every portion of the ship. Everyone can
[01:20:32] hear it. And this commanding officer gets on the one MC and he's going to make a speech, right?
[01:20:37] Because that's what commanding officer does sometimes. And he says, I thought he was going to make the
[01:20:44] most epic speech because he's not the most epic. But I thought he's going to say something pretty powerful.
[01:20:48] Sure. He says, um, he says, hey, when you when when when you see a piece of trash on the ship,
[01:20:55] and when I see a piece of trash, I thought he was going to say, when I see a piece of trash, man, I go and pick it up.
[01:21:03] And he said he said something along the lines of when I see a piece of trash, I'm frustrated that
[01:21:08] nobody picked it up. And think about the the impact of those two statements, if he said what I thought he was
[01:21:14] going to say, which is, hey, when I see a piece of trash on the floor, I go over and I pick it up and
[01:21:19] put it away or throw it away. And then I make sure there's no other trash near it because I want this ship to
[01:21:24] shine. That's one thing. He said, hey, when I see a piece of trash on the ship, I get so frustrated
[01:21:31] that you aren't cleaning it up. And I was so let down that that that commanding officer said,
[01:21:36] that's true. But to your point, if you know, it's like the reason I thought of that is because you
[01:21:42] can see when even when I'm been in the commander of a unit of some kind, and I would see when I
[01:21:50] walk in unexpected, there's like a change. You know, and it's not always, you know, sometimes I've seen
[01:21:55] it where guys, the commander walks in and it's people who do that because of fear, right? Yeah, that's
[01:22:00] not different. That's not what we're looking for. Yeah. You want to say, oh, the boss is here. I don't
[01:22:04] want him to see that this is going on. I don't know. This is we shouldn't be doing that. We should.
[01:22:09] And that's you're right. That is a real powerful, real powerful,
[01:22:13] thought that he puts in here about how when the boss comes around, when the commander comes around
[01:22:21] and you, and it actually provides the troopers, the ability to see what he's seeing and how powerful
[01:22:27] that is. Well, in time, Jita, I forget what he had to do this thing where it's like it was like a
[01:22:33] tense thing. And he was just telling, he's talking to Sarah about it. And he's like, yeah, I'm going to
[01:22:38] leave like right after that because I don't want to have to face like some awkwardness or something
[01:22:42] like that. And then I'm kind of once there are life-hours like, I'm going to tell Jockel that you're
[01:22:47] going to do that. And you're like, oh, like, you knew how's joking, but he was like, you know, kind of like,
[01:22:53] what would you think about that? You're not even in Swasberland. Obviously, but it's kind of like that thing.
[01:22:58] You know, like, it would like, you're watching remember, Commander? Yeah, it's not like, yeah,
[01:23:03] go ahead. The part, there's this part, right? Where the story behind Commander is one of his
[01:23:11] guys that he trained and stuff went rogue, went bad, came back and they thought he was dead and
[01:23:17] he comes back and he helps, you know, you know, you know, great, sorry. Yeah, but it's built. Anyway,
[01:23:23] so this bad guy now, he, you could still, you could tell he still has all this admiration for
[01:23:29] his name is John Matrix for Arnold. They have Arnold because he's like, he's walking around the
[01:23:34] compound that he's kind of like, you know, and all these guys are like talking tough and stuff.
[01:23:39] So he goes to the other boss that he's now working with. He's all, it's funny to hear your men talk
[01:23:46] tough, it makes me laugh. If Matrix was here, he'd laugh too. You know, kind of like he's,
[01:23:51] it's almost like him and Matrix run the same team still, you know, he knows how he would see that,
[01:23:55] you know, kind of that same thing. Presence. Awesome. So, wrapping that rough transition,
[01:24:06] hmm. People want to support the podcasts. Are they going to do it? Echo Charles.
[01:24:14] Well, one way, the way I like to recommend one of the many is by supporting yourself at the same
[01:24:23] time on its supplements and where your bars on a dot com slash joc will get 10% off.
[01:24:30] Before this podcast, I'll make it short. Before this podcast, when I get a
[01:24:40] a shrimp tech, I didn't get 10% off. Now you can get 10% off or if you shop at Amazon,
[01:24:50] click through our websites is another way you can support podcasts. Click through our websites,
[01:24:54] Amazon link. Our website that's jocobotcast.com and jocostore.com. There's a little thing you can click on.
[01:25:03] Yep, and you can support that way. Because it's like, everything doesn't cost. No, it does not.
[01:25:07] It barely costs you time, barely. Really the thing is remembering to go there. Yeah. So that's kind of a thing.
[01:25:16] A good solution to that. Yes, which we do have now. A little trooper tool. Trooper tool is what it's called.
[01:25:23] It's this cool little thing. And it's on the website as well. It says trooper tool chrome extension.
[01:25:29] Boom. Click on it. Put a little icon on the top of your browser and it automatically
[01:25:35] affiliates your Amazon experience with us support passes. Passively. Passively. No,
[01:25:43] passively as opposed to passively. No, no, no, it's aggressive. Yes. But it's not.
[01:25:49] Yeah. Passively means you didn't do anything. It's not. We have we have troopers out there that are
[01:25:55] aggressively shopping on Amazon to support the podcast and I dig that. Yep. I'd rather sometimes.
[01:26:05] My friends on Twitter. They'll send me like a screenshot. Boom. Of their trooper tool or their
[01:26:11] little purchase. Like, yeah, bought this stuff tape. Here's my fan. It's a screenshot. No. Yeah.
[01:26:19] It really makes me feel empowered and I'm not joking. Well, this does help the podcast. Yeah.
[01:26:26] So fully appreciate it. Really. Subscribe to the podcast. Of course, I tunes and then on YouTube.
[01:26:32] As well. I'm slowly playing more videos. I'll put a few and keep putting more.
[01:26:38] So you're not just stuck watching the podcast, which is cool too. By the way, if you're into watching it
[01:26:46] and listening is sometimes like people will put it on their screen as they work out. You know? So they
[01:26:51] can kind of watch lists in workout. Watch lists, you know, it's a good little formula. You know,
[01:26:55] yeah, YouTube is a good one as well. And of course, the jocquistor. If you like,
[01:27:01] you know, shirts and whatnot, coffee mug stickers, they're pretty cool. I've got some great feedback.
[01:27:09] One announcement. We have women's stuff coming out. In about what a week or two.
[01:27:20] So yeah. So all the female troopers. Yeah. Who have been pressuring strongly recommend. Yeah. We'll say
[01:27:29] consistently strongly recommending. Yeah. Yeah. They're good ones. I chose three colors.
[01:27:35] You're going to have to wait and see which ones they are. And when they do come out, give me more
[01:27:40] feedback. I want to narrow it down to the stuff that we all want. So yeah, go do that.
[01:27:47] Talk of store.com. There's some cool stuff. If you like it, boom, get one or two or however many
[01:27:52] and that supports as well. And plus that means I don't have to buy my wife anything.
[01:27:56] Yeah. I'll just give it. Yeah. I'll send one. I don't have the
[01:28:00] podcast. That's actually one of the good reasons I like managing this stuff. I don't have to
[01:28:05] not that I really butchered that much anyway, but I have a bunch of shirts now. Plus maybe my daughter
[01:28:10] is too. Yeah. Perfect. That's a good. You know, do you go? Everybody's good to go. Are they regular
[01:28:16] are they the same design? Or is it something new? Uh, it's there. Yeah, they're more or less the same.
[01:28:21] But they're, you know, they're based at the Williams version. Okay. Well, what we got,
[01:28:25] I started with a discipline equals freedom. I might just do one for women because let's face it.
[01:28:30] Like we all get get after it in pretty much the same way except for everyone's in a while. Women
[01:28:36] get after it in a different way. Everyone's in a while. So it might be worth it to get them
[01:28:42] a little some different, some special. Just my opinion. Awesome. All right. There you go. That's always
[01:28:49] a support support that podcast, yeah. And with that question. It's a great one. I am a Marine
[01:29:02] Corps vet. Only four years. And I recently hired another Marine. He had a great reputation and a lot
[01:29:09] of experience as NCO leader, Gunny Sergeant. But he's not doing well in our company. He only seems to
[01:29:16] lead through fear slash authority. It isn't working. He has high standards, which I like, but he's
[01:29:23] not gaining the respect of his team or the rest of the company. What's going on? And how can I fix it?
[01:29:32] This is kind of a classic case. And unfortunately, it's an unfortunate case too. And what we have
[01:29:39] here is an example of a guy that's probably pretty charismatic. He's probably pretty aggressive.
[01:29:46] He's probably pretty loud. He's probably pretty authoritative. He's probably pretty smart. He's
[01:29:50] probably physically impressive. In other words, he's probably got a lot of natural good leadership traits.
[01:29:58] And I surmise in a situation like this that this is a type of person that took the basics of
[01:30:06] what the military taught him and utilized it to lead. And so what he did was he used
[01:30:13] imposed discipline. That's what guy used on him. And that's what he used. So it's the things that we
[01:30:20] just talked about. It's intimidation. It's the whole thing with maneuver warfare versus a
[01:30:26] tristion warfare that the military still teaches. Unfortunately, that the job of leaders is to
[01:30:35] obey orders and ensure orders are obeyed. Okay. That's that's what the military, unfortunately,
[01:30:41] in some cases teaches. And you can go through your career. And that's what you can kind of learn.
[01:30:45] Or you can have some good leadership inside the military that teaches you the better way, the way to
[01:30:51] actually lead. And so, but if you're raised that the way that your job as a leader is to obey
[01:31:01] orders and ensure that orders are obeyed. If that's your job, how do you do that? Well, you do it through
[01:31:06] blunt force trauma. That's how you do it. And as I've said before, that does work for a time period.
[01:31:16] It does get the job done. It's micro management. And fortunately or unfortunately, in the military,
[01:31:22] you've got people that rapidly cycle through leadership positions. And so it's not like you are
[01:31:30] permanently in charge of the same group of people. So you can kind of get away with it because you do
[01:31:36] a work up and it doesn't work up a stressful and then you go on deployment to tool it's only six
[01:31:39] months long. And by the time you're done, everybody hates you, but it's okay. You're moving on to your
[01:31:42] next job. And so that's how people survive. And what really hurts about this is because they survive
[01:31:51] that leadership position. It actually reinforces that type of leadership behavior, which is not good.
[01:31:57] But what they do is, if let's say you do, it just an American kind of mindset of, hey,
[01:32:04] if some is good, more is better. And so they take this, this attitude and they become more
[01:32:14] more aggressive. They impose more discipline. They raise this standards to a ridiculous level.
[01:32:19] Where it's no longer even sensible. Where things just become stupid. Like we used to say,
[01:32:27] so I don't know why they call this, but in the military, they call the push-up position,
[01:32:30] the front leaning rest. Front leaning rest. I don't know why. But then they also use the term
[01:32:37] forward leaning. Meaning, hey, we want to be ahead. We want to be ready for a new prepared. And I used to say,
[01:32:44] let's not be so far forward leaning that we're in the leaning rest. Meaning that we're leaning
[01:32:49] so far forward that we're wasting our energy and getting tired. And so at a certain point,
[01:32:54] it can become super. An example this would be like a uniform inspections.
[01:32:59] Like, okay, you got to have a square-to-a uniform. You know, you got to be able to break out
[01:33:03] uniform, look sharp. Well, if you do that every day, you're wasting time because it's not the most
[01:33:09] important thing. It does have a level of importance somewhere on the hierarchy of important things.
[01:33:14] Not real high, but there's some people, if you're a strict military disciplinary in,
[01:33:21] you might think I need to have a uniform inspection every single day, because my guys are going to
[01:33:24] look the best. And so you got a bunch of guys that not only are they wasting time prepping their
[01:33:28] uniform and paying for the uniform get dry cleaned. And they're actually using their uniform so
[01:33:33] much, they're dressed uniform so much that they're providing wear and tear on it. And so it's just,
[01:33:38] it's just stupid. Doesn't make any sense. So that's what they do. These leaders that have been
[01:33:46] raised like that, they start to do it even more. And it just defeats its own purpose. And most
[01:33:51] important is that these leaders start to stifle free thought from their subordinates.
[01:34:00] And eventually, and this is even more critical, eventually they begin to stifle free thought from their own
[01:34:07] brain. And that's likely what happened in a situation like this. And you know, you got a guy that
[01:34:16] again was raised in this attitude and he took that attitude and he amplified that attitude and that
[01:34:21] is how he was successful and he amplified it even more. And he ends up now he breaks out of the
[01:34:25] brain core. Well, now it's not just a six month appointment. You got to lead people for years and
[01:34:29] years and years and you got to go from different various projects and all these personalities and
[01:34:35] and it's a more sensitive environment because it's in the civilian sector and lives aren't necessarily
[01:34:41] it's stake. And so what do you need to do? What what you need him to do? So that I'm talking to the
[01:34:49] leader that asked this question, what what can you do to help? Well, what you need that former
[01:34:55] marine gun resurgence to do, what you need him to see is that the next level of leadership, the
[01:35:05] next progression along the spectrum of leadership is not more of all that. It's actually less.
[01:35:16] It's not more imposed discipline on your troops. It's actually less. It's the troops having
[01:35:22] free thought and self discipline and it is not you leading more. It is actually you leading less.
[01:35:32] It is not you taking more ownership is you taking less ownership and your troops taking more
[01:35:38] ownership. It is him giving guidance, giving commanders intent and then stepping back.
[01:35:49] It is him not being the focus because a lot of times when you're in a leadership position that can be
[01:35:56] an ego feeder and all of a sudden you want to be the center of attention you want to be in the spotlight
[01:36:02] but you don't want to be that. You want to be less of that and it and I'm telling you.
[01:36:10] So that's what you got to do. You got to open his eyes to what the next level of leadership looks
[01:36:15] like. He's never had that opened for him and I'm going to tell you right now it's going to be
[01:36:20] hard to get him there because there's a good chance that he's a hard person to coach because
[01:36:24] he's been successful with the techniques that he learned and he has experience and that
[01:36:31] experience has strengthened his resolve and his belief and his leadership technique.
[01:36:39] It's it's a tough situation. So you're likely going to have to take an indirect approach.
[01:36:44] And so for instance here's a good one. Hey I was wondering you know who's going to take your place
[01:36:52] when it's you know when it's time for promotion who you're grooming to fill your shoes.
[01:36:56] Because guess what he's not grooming anybody. Or you ask him how much time he's spending looking
[01:37:06] up and out at what's going on strategic as opposed to down and in at his own little element.
[01:37:14] And the other thing that you could do is assign him some higher level projects that actually pull
[01:37:20] him out of the micro management weeds and maybe even put him on projects with people that don't
[01:37:29] micro manage and good leaders that lead in a good way put him on some kind of project with them so he can
[01:37:36] see what that looks like. And obviously these are just some suggestions of approaches because you're
[01:37:45] probably going to have to you'll have to adapt those and figure out exactly how to walk him through
[01:37:56] to the end state which the end state the commander's intent for me is you want to teach him what the
[01:38:01] next what the next level the next advancement of leadership skill for him is and it's something
[01:38:10] that's the opposite of what he learned so good challenge yeah yeah that that leading from authority
[01:38:23] thing and fear and authority it's almost like it's so black and white where when someone does that it's so
[01:38:31] clear it's very clear and it's very addictive person because there's immediate gratification I told you to
[01:38:38] do it and then the kids he worked yeah it kind of takes less work to a lot of the time
[01:38:45] totally takes less work you don't have to invest in relationships you don't do invest in
[01:38:49] in indirect approaches on things of course it takes less work it's it's real simple yeah you can
[01:38:56] kind of give into your temper sometimes too yeah your temper's a little bit of a tool with that
[01:39:01] kind of the problem is over time these that type of leadership doesn't work you want to be
[01:39:07] with the beloved captain who never lost his temper who never yelled at his men and yet who would
[01:39:12] follow him into the fires of hell yeah next question if you had a leader at work we did not
[01:39:24] respect and know as ineffective and you've communicated that team yet when they see you they try to
[01:39:32] shake your hand how would you react and how would you deny their hands shake offering
[01:39:40] appreciate the feedback so um okay this is just off the mark right I mean all I hope I hope
[01:39:47] people realize that this is no it's okay I mean I understand the reason I put this in there just because
[01:39:53] this is what we talked about earlier where you think man I'm holding the line and I'm holding the
[01:39:59] line and this is my expectations of a leader and you don't fit it so I'm gonna number one I'm
[01:40:03] gonna tell you number two if you try and shake my hand you're not getting right so that's what we
[01:40:08] call an adversary relationship and it's not what we want how let me ask you this how is this going
[01:40:14] to help your cause to have an air adversary relationship with your boss how does it help your
[01:40:18] cause is he gonna listen you more or less is he gonna support you more or less will he give you what
[01:40:25] you want more or less which one you won't shake his hand and and you think he's gonna support you
[01:40:34] in any way no and furthermore is he if you have an adversary relationship with your boss is he
[01:40:42] more likely to promote you into position where you can have more control over decisions for the team
[01:40:47] and for your own future what do you think the answer to that is negative all those answers are obvious
[01:40:56] this whole concept is wrong our job is to build a relationship with our boss and honestly we
[01:41:07] have everyone else for that matter that's what we're trying to do straight up disrespecting the boss
[01:41:13] or again anyone is not gonna help our cause it's gonna hurt it now this doesn't mean that we're
[01:41:23] kissing ass this doesn't mean that we're folding it doesn't mean that we're weak this is this is
[01:41:29] this is the this is the challenge for me to convince people that want to be strong leaders that this
[01:41:34] doesn't mean that you are weak it actually takes more strength to control your emotions it takes
[01:41:43] more strength to remain professional it takes more strength to focus on the long term win
[01:41:50] and not the short term frustration it takes more strength to keep your ego in check and I would say
[01:42:01] that this whole question is a good is it is an indicator to me I might need to check my own ego
[01:42:11] okay am I critical of my boss am I critical because of my boss because I'm a little bit jealous is that possible
[01:42:20] am I critical of my boss because I think I deserve the job more than they do
[01:42:26] do I think that my boss got lucky or he's a brown noiser or he's favored some way that's
[01:42:33] why he got it and I'm gonna be better about it and therefore I'm not gonna respect him
[01:42:39] all the loose right there ego talking right full on ego talking so you got to put the ego in check
[01:42:46] you got to support the boss and you got to support the team then that's the best way to support the
[01:42:51] boss and support the team and the obvious caveat to this is if the boss is doing something that's
[01:42:58] illegal or a moral or an ethical then fine yeah of course absolutely you can call them out
[01:43:05] you can deny his handshake you can report him up the chain of command or to the authorities
[01:43:10] because if you're part of what he's doing and you know it then you're complicit in the activities
[01:43:16] so you're at risk anyways and it's the right thing to do so obviously in those cases yeah
[01:43:24] you you can hold your ground but borrowing those extreme circumstances what you want to do with your
[01:43:31] boss is build the relationship and again it's not just your boss it's your peers it's your chain
[01:43:36] of command up and down you want to build those relationships instead of breaking them yeah
[01:43:44] yeah it seems it's still not funny it's interesting how when you lay it out and I'm sure a lot
[01:43:50] it may be even when it's listening to this just hearing this question out loud it seems obvious you know
[01:43:57] but really you try to think about yourself in this situation yeah where yeah you don't like this
[01:44:03] guy and maybe he said some stuff to offend you even and you don't respect him obviously so yeah
[01:44:08] like you don't want to shake this guy's hand like how you feel is a lot of times what dictates
[01:44:14] your behavior you know towards people and just otherwise so when you're in the situation this
[01:44:19] is kind of like it's so hard to be like yeah I don't respect his whole methods I don't like any of
[01:44:26] this stuff he's gonna come shake my hand it's so hard to be like sure and and do what you're talking
[01:44:30] about it can be put your ego and check put your emotions and yeah put your attitude and check
[01:44:36] and just go hey boss how's it going today you know everything's going good here yeah
[01:44:42] so I appreciate the support you've been given us there's one decision you made I was kind of
[01:44:46] wondering about I'd love to get love to pick your brain on and some point oh really
[01:44:50] whereas if I just go I don't want to shake your hand I hate you I basically disrespect you and I hate
[01:44:57] you and I hate you and not what you do decision you made over here as long as you can listen to me there's
[01:45:01] no chance there's no chance you're gonna wait you're gonna lose the argument yeah me when I go in there
[01:45:06] when I say boss how's it going yes yeah no problem hey I want to think I want to pick your
[01:45:10] brain about the decision you made over here is you gonna listen to me got a better chance still
[01:45:14] might say no but guess what I'm fighting along or I'm gonna outlast him I'm gonna outwork him I'm
[01:45:18] out maneuver him yeah my boss is gonna do what I want him to do I know and yeah you gotta keep
[01:45:24] that in mind man yeah because when you're in it when you lose that little about it because really
[01:45:28] that's what it is when you're shaking your hand and you're like in your head you're like I hate
[01:45:32] you I don't want to shake your hand shaking get your hand out of my feet your whole existence of
[01:45:37] your hand front of my face is an insult that's what you're thinking so if you shake it you lost that
[01:45:41] battle and that that's bad right there for you that's a real bad it's it's very very
[01:45:47] yeah immature when yeah it just feels right at the at the time yeah if you got your emotions get
[01:45:53] all crazy if you're not being strategic that's it if you're not thinking about winning yeah and
[01:45:58] by no means you're not playing the game correctly I know that's it but the point is I
[01:46:03] understand you feel it's good if we say it out loud it's like oh my gosh it's so clear you know
[01:46:08] how I'm always asking you know what you you you just indicated to me something very obvious
[01:46:13] is that over time you know over time you get to you okay you go for a hard workout and you get to
[01:46:20] you look forward to the feeling afterwards of that yeah I did this hard workout there's some
[01:46:25] door fins or whatever I'm gonna tell you at some point I developed some sort of attitude
[01:46:30] where when I when I control myself and I make a good strategic move if it feels just as good
[01:46:36] yeah it feels way better than the short term oh man I really told him no no wrong answer you
[01:46:42] lost you want the battle lost the work idiot that's what I feel like if I make that mistake
[01:46:47] that's absolutely correct they only you've could you condition yourself to the whole process you
[01:46:51] know because you probably went through it a few times tasted the fruits you know winning the
[01:46:55] lot but so it's just with experience that exactly right exactly right so and there's ways you
[01:47:01] can kind of do that to yourself like I do if like even if you have like an ultimately when
[01:47:07] when you boil kind of your whole way of thinking down when you do have an ego that you think is like
[01:47:12] a functional ego but use that ego to win the long word so like kind of like what I did with
[01:47:17] getting mad it's like no one can like my like no one's gonna tell me I have a little self esteem
[01:47:22] because really you know anger and grace is usually because a little self esteem so in this case you
[01:47:28] could be like hey if you ever facilitate that adversarial relationship where you don't shake his hand
[01:47:33] or you're like you want to as he said you've communicated that to him you have leader that you
[01:47:40] don't respect and you know is ineffective and you told them okay so keep that when you say stuff
[01:47:45] like that consider that is like your weakness like just tell yourself that what it is
[01:47:50] say that's your weakness but forgetting a long word and for and for showing your cards that
[01:47:55] showing your question yes yeah just it's this little internal thing you tell yourself
[01:48:00] and then just like how you're saying where you feel dumb any of you if your ego can't handle that
[01:48:05] can't handle all that then go I'll go back to my point that I said this doesn't mean you're weak
[01:48:10] it means that you are winning yeah well flip it around as far as what you tell yourself like
[01:48:15] you know it feels weak to lose a small battle I understand but flip it around and say hey say it
[01:48:20] is no if you win it at the expense of the long that means your weak say that to yourself and it'll
[01:48:25] get easier you know if you're rushing yourself if you lose the long-term battle you're
[01:48:29] even more weak yes that's the big weakness for the big weakness all right next question
[01:48:38] for the pilot cast what would a jacco school for boys and girls eight to sixteen years old
[01:48:46] should this be interesting what would that look like schedule subjects physical education
[01:48:52] so first of all I would love to do this and it's seriously one day I would I may do this
[01:48:59] Lord of the fly yes I I actually really do relate to kids for some reason and I think a school
[01:49:09] I think I could develop a school that would be awesome and outstanding and would produce
[01:49:14] really stable strong mentally capable children for the world so and so I was so happy when I saw
[01:49:29] this question and I've actually looked and I've actually I've actually pondered the ideas of you know
[01:49:35] buying a buying a piece of property you know what it would cost maybe getting some investors together
[01:49:40] that we're gonna build a skype up literally I've actually looked for property which is something
[01:49:44] I do all the time but I've looked for property and said okay this would probably work so like a
[01:49:49] like almost like an extension school like in the little oh no like an academy like a school that you
[01:49:54] go to and you and we we what we could probably do is do like a instead of a hey you're going to go
[01:50:01] here from six grade to graduation you go for like one year you go one year here you go back to
[01:50:10] your regular school after you've been in the school for a year you're going back to your regular
[01:50:13] school you're going to totally dominate you're going to be number one you're going to learn so much
[01:50:19] more it's just going to be awesome so we would need to bring we wouldn't need to bring these young
[01:50:25] these these children into the school for for the entire time because you know you could go
[01:50:30] back out of the regular world and overlay what you learned at the academy and you would just
[01:50:38] dominate and so yeah maybe I'll end up doing that someday and this schedule I mean I didn't spend that
[01:50:48] much time on it it doesn't really even take that much time to figure out because you know what we're
[01:50:53] doing we're waking up very early in the morning we're doing our hardcore PT some kind of sports variety
[01:50:59] of sports guess what we're playing every sport you know baseball basketball swimming football
[01:51:04] soccer wrestling judo boxing we're going to do a little bit of everything that's going to happen
[01:51:09] really I mean obviously we're getting up at 430 we are up before the sun gets up I mean that's the
[01:51:14] way it is and then we get the knowledge so we go into the classrooms the classrooms I would get
[01:51:22] instructors that were full on engaged in what they're doing just in the game that love their subject
[01:51:29] and that can relate it's the world and most important because I think this is what's lacking
[01:51:36] sometimes most important through all the different knowledge courses or all the basic knowledge there
[01:51:43] would be a common thread that connects them all together because that's what I think people are missing
[01:51:52] that a lot I think we miss that that underlying theme of a few our educational system but I think
[01:52:00] when you connect everything they're more powerful like when you connect math the science to history
[01:52:05] to English to foreign language and you connect those to art in music and you connect there's
[01:52:11] some there because there are all those things if you look at history all those things are connected
[01:52:16] they're all connected but we don't make the connections and when you don't connect things they're
[01:52:20] weaker so I would force or I wouldn't you would have to force it you don't have to force it I would
[01:52:28] I would foster that thread through everything so that everything made sense in a big picture
[01:52:38] and that way when you get granular you're tying it into this overlying theme of civilization and
[01:52:44] the movement of the way things go through civilization now I'll tell you another piece of this
[01:52:53] you would learn vocational skills at my school a hundred percent you would learn carpenter you
[01:52:58] would learn how to do electrical wiring you would learn plumbing you would learn automotive
[01:53:04] and repair you would learn all those things and guess what are you going to take those courses like I
[01:53:10] said this this court this school would probably only be a year long that's fine because guess what
[01:53:15] you know long it takes to learn basic carpenter not real long are you know you're skilled carpenter
[01:53:21] no but I'm not looking to build skilled carpeters are you going to be ready to rewire a giant building
[01:53:27] a commercial building no but could you rewire a house likely it doesn't take that much time to
[01:53:33] learn that you won't be skilled at it but you have the knowledge same thing with plumbing and
[01:53:40] like I said the automotive so I so you would learn those vocational skills because we have people
[01:53:44] in America right now that don't know any that stuff and that's jacked up yeah even like when I was
[01:53:52] young my dad used to make us change our own oil you can you can go anywhere it takes like in
[01:53:58] way or 50 minutes but he's like no you change your own oil you got to know what to do with the oil you know
[01:54:03] there's this little process you can't just be rolling around and change flat tire even now I
[01:54:07] have to play I don't I don't culture play for flat tire because so I hadn't got to flat tire in
[01:54:11] long time I got to flat tire one day and actually recently I didn't get any kind of flat tire so none
[01:54:16] of the less but I change in every time because when I first got it after not having a flat tire for a
[01:54:21] while I thought oh man do I even remember how to do this I of course I did I remember how to do
[01:54:27] it's not that hard just like I said so there are people who don't know they get a flat tire and
[01:54:33] they're they're lost they're lost they're lost they're yeah they only have triple air whatever
[01:54:36] sure they get saved but if they can do them themselves you know so at my school you would learn
[01:54:43] those vocational skills and then on top of that you'd learn basic survival skills
[01:54:51] little hunting little fishing little gardening and planting and how to grow things grow food
[01:54:57] and your basics water fire and shelter you learn those so you'd be able to survive in an environment
[01:55:04] in any situation obviously with all those survival skills and the vocational skills and even the
[01:55:12] classroom knowledge skills there would be a a system of team building where you're going to be
[01:55:22] doing things together as a team not only for your classes but also cleaning the place working together
[01:55:28] as a team and that's what they do in military boot camps all you do clean they turn cleaning
[01:55:33] into like a team building exercise so we would do that people would be in simple uniforms you
[01:55:41] know nothing too fancy obviously the nighttime would be the study of the martial arts
[01:55:50] and you would learn the basics of jujitsu boxing, moitai and wrestling and that's what my
[01:56:00] school would be like and there'd be some real discipline there and there would be real achievement
[01:56:05] and I think that anybody that spent one year in that school right there would have a
[01:56:12] infinitely greater chance of success and domination in whatever they feel they chose to go into
[01:56:20] and when they went back to their school to their regular school you know it's funny at first at first
[01:56:25] thought when I'm here I'm kind of picturing this stuff or whatever and I'm sure I'm not the only
[01:56:30] one listening to this where you're like oh shoot that probably that's a hardcore school you know they
[01:56:35] got to be ready to to get but then you know you want to go well when you think about it you're
[01:56:39] probably wouldn't be that hardcore in fact it'd probably be kind of fun given your approach to you know
[01:56:46] teaching or in leading and stuff like that because man I remember when I it was like when I first
[01:56:52] met you I met you and you don't remember when I first met you but so I kind of knew you were
[01:56:55] whatever little bit this was back at the boxing club and you came in first time I saw your kids
[01:57:01] door like Thor and I think one of his systems I forget I don't know which one I forget they're
[01:57:05] just little kids and you'd brought them or whatever and they come in the door and they just start
[01:57:11] running around like this is a big playground right? Psychopath right? Yeah hitting the bags and doing
[01:57:16] all this stuff right and then you had this look on your face kind of like it's almost like you
[01:57:20] had control of the situation but you're just gonna let them be them kind of thing and I remember
[01:57:24] just kind of kind of looking at like all this is interesting I never seen Jockel and his kids you know
[01:57:29] so let me so it's kind of just watching so decentralized command it was really the
[01:57:34] matter of speaking it so um do you just started kind of going on and I think you might even been teaching
[01:57:41] I don't know you're involved in some way and they got loud real quick and it kind of was like
[01:57:48] for like a better term kind of distracting and you like kind of stop what you're doing you were like
[01:57:54] you could stop that like real mean and then I was like let me see like how they react you know I look
[01:58:01] and then they stop they look at you like just just for maybe almost two seconds they look
[01:58:05] you look at each other like that and they just start laughing and they keep going and they like
[01:58:10] you kind of started laughing at the same day I was like oh I see like you're probably strict but
[01:58:16] just not that's their kids you know they're doing kids stuff we want they're not breaking
[01:58:20] nothing yeah so it was like it's almost like they knew and then they knew beyond that you know
[01:58:25] like they knew what was ultimately up that was interesting well you know maybe we can put this
[01:58:30] school together at some point I know there's a lot of people that would love to send their kids
[01:58:36] to a school like this on every and I would obviously I would send all my kids to school like this tomorrow
[01:58:42] if it existed yeah one year of the academy that's what it's called the academy I think it would
[01:58:49] have to be you know a big part of it and I'm sure this would probably I'm sure this would
[01:58:56] would be implemented in the whole system is how the teachers and instructors are treated
[01:59:03] for sure you know like because I think that's a lot of the time anyway like one of the
[01:59:09] many issues you know one that one issues come up in education it's like how are the teachers
[01:59:14] regarded yeah in that situation yeah man yeah good sign me up okay next question
[01:59:23] I'm about to accept a position across the country after changing the IT field I work in
[01:59:28] I've just been accepted from my first job and in this type of position with the amount of
[01:59:33] responsibility I'll have and I'm not or I'm having some issues and some hesitations on if I'll be good enough
[01:59:39] have you ever been in a position before were you tried to bite off more than you can chew professionally
[01:59:45] how do you approach it and is there ever a time where you think it's best to bow out and quit and if so
[01:59:52] how do you know when that point is so actually most people get
[01:59:57] hired into leadership positions they haven't been in before the seal teams is all about that you
[02:00:03] get promoted you do that leadership job and just as you're getting the hang of it you get promoted again
[02:00:10] so there's nothing abnormal about feeling that you aren't quite ready for a leadership position
[02:00:16] and the reason that some people fail when they get to these positions that they're not ready for
[02:00:23] is because they're nervous that they're going to show that and so they try to hide it
[02:00:29] they're afraid to ask questions they're afraid to say they don't know so they end up looking
[02:00:35] scared and stupid which equates to looking incompetent and I mean even just with the beloved
[02:00:46] captain they they actually kicked off there's a reason this guy included those statements in there
[02:00:51] that he asked questions and asked for guidance and admitted his mistakes there's a reason that he was
[02:00:57] beloved that is one of the reasons and so so so that's what you got to do is
[02:01:10] be okay with it don't try and hide it now to bow out and quit I have not done that
[02:01:14] but there's no reason to because if I don't know how to do something I have no problem asking
[02:01:21] for help up and down the chain of command up and down the chain of command nothing wrong with that
[02:01:29] and I've said this before that what what you're feeling
[02:01:35] person that asked this question what you're feeling that you aren't good enough and that you don't
[02:01:39] want to blow at those are actually signs of humility and it's okay those are good I've felt those
[02:01:46] feelings my whole career and I still feel them now and when I was in the suit teams I would over
[02:01:52] prepare for things and it wasn't because I thought I was going to dominate it was because I thought I was
[02:01:56] going to fall short and even I was telling you I prepared for the podcast all yesterday I thought I was
[02:02:06] good literally had printed out my notes woke up this morning worked out and I was like no I'm not
[02:02:11] ready I over prepared for this why because in my mind I'm feeling I'm going to blow it
[02:02:18] and I don't like that but there's a thing it's like a for real thing it's called imposter syndrome
[02:02:25] you're you're heard that no but it's this and I think you know what I think I think everyone has
[02:02:29] it and it's in whether a teeny tiny bit or a lot it's where it's basically you feel this you feel like
[02:02:36] I'm re-like on the inside like I'm really not this good you can be like champion of the world
[02:02:41] on the inside you're like this just a matter of time before they find me out you know I don't know
[02:02:45] I don't deserve to be here whatever that I wish more people would have that because there's a lot of
[02:02:50] people that I know that have been in leadership positions that feel that they have the divine right
[02:02:55] yeah to be there a lot of times if they'll have it they'll behave in that oh they absolutely do
[02:03:01] that's why they fail that's crazy so rehash as always bottom line be humble
[02:03:09] study and learn what you can ask questions and if you don't know something admit it now I had to
[02:03:16] make this note and I'm cautious to even say this but I do have to say it asking questions doesn't just
[02:03:27] mean putting your ignorance on clear display all the time okay when you ask questions make sure you
[02:03:37] are asking thoughtful meaningful questions it in fact if you can find out the answer on your own
[02:03:46] do that if it's something that you can refer back to and you can look up and you can go back and you can
[02:03:50] check out the work chart you can see where that department is or you can find out who's run in that
[02:03:54] project without having to ask that question do that because contrary to popular belief there actually
[02:04:03] is in fact such a thing as a stupid question and you can get away with it sometimes so you don't
[02:04:09] need to be hyper paranoid about it but you also part of leadership is confidence and up and down
[02:04:20] so you gotta have some confidence and you people have to have some confidence in you and if
[02:04:24] if you don't know anything and you can't figure it out for you can't figure out some portions of that
[02:04:32] on your own that's not a good sign because I just expect if you're gonna be in charge of me
[02:04:37] that you couldn't look that up you didn't you didn't review this before you came in here I know you
[02:04:42] don't know my job but you should at least know what the requirements of my job are you shouldn't
[02:04:46] at least know what the outcomes at a strategic level of my job are right you see what I'm saying
[02:04:52] there's a difference so you don't have to go in there and be overly humble you don't have to go in
[02:05:01] there and be overtly blank wide open with what you don't know because again I was cautious to make
[02:05:12] this note because this doesn't I you should feel comfortable enough saying hey I don't know how to do this
[02:05:17] or hey can you explain that the way that works to me can you explain what this project you know
[02:05:21] what this project entails there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that but
[02:05:26] if you go into a room and you accidentally ask a question of something that everybody legitimately
[02:05:34] should know you're gonna look stupid that's a mistake that's a mistake and so don't do that it's
[02:05:42] okay be humble ask questions but ask thoughtful questions meaning for questions that you don't know
[02:05:50] because it's it would be pretty difficult for you to know the answer yeah yeah it's I mean it
[02:05:56] kind of seems obvious when you say it out loud where you're not gonna know everything no so that
[02:06:01] makes sense but you gotta know something you gotta be there for reason you can't be like hey I don't
[02:06:07] know nothing I shouldn't be hearing you and that's another thing from the beloved captain where he
[02:06:10] says for a few days he didn't do anything yes what if you can observe for a few days you're probably
[02:06:16] gonna answer a bunch of questions just for observation and taking notes and getting back and maybe
[02:06:22] conferring with your trusted agent or your senior enlisted guy or your your superintendent you
[02:06:30] can confer directly with them and keep that build that relationship while your garnering information
[02:06:36] mm-hmm yeah don't be that guy try not to yes yeah try not to
[02:06:46] jockel how do I take ownership of mixed messages to the people under me from the other leaders in my group
[02:06:55] pretty straightforward question I like it well first of all you have to address this straight up with
[02:07:01] the other leaders in your group because if you aren't aligned as a leadership team this is gonna
[02:07:07] hurt the cause it is absolutely gonna hurt the cause this is critical and it's gonna be hard
[02:07:12] and there are some things in your group that people do not agree on and that is why they are
[02:07:17] undermining the messaging or why they're giving out different messaging because they don't agree
[02:07:22] with it they don't have the courage to stand up and say hey I don't agree with this right here so
[02:07:27] let's do it a different way here's my thoughts they don't have the courage to that so what do they
[02:07:30] do they just sit back and then when it comes time to put out the word they put out the mixed messages
[02:07:34] and it's it's a bad situation and you actually have to lead here that's what you have to do and
[02:07:40] it shouldn't actually be that hard because what you're asking for is something that anybody can tell
[02:07:47] is important so you know you said you say your leadership team you go hey guys our message to the
[02:07:52] troops needs to be aligned and right now it isn't we need to fix that is there anyone on your
[02:07:58] leadership team is gonna disagree with that no they won't that's not what they disagree with they
[02:08:02] everybody knows that the leadership team has to have an aligned message they have to be on the same
[02:08:07] sheet of music and that's what you need to do and and again it's gonna be a hard conversation
[02:08:15] it's gonna bring out that statement should bring out the conversation of what people don't
[02:08:20] agree on and why they're sending messages now if you if you cannot get them aligned it is a
[02:08:30] serious problem but if you can't the best thing you can do is mitigate mitigate that to your team
[02:08:41] by becoming the trusted voice so so with your team you want to become the trusted voice now
[02:08:47] you doesn't mean that you're going to undermine your other leaders it's a echo came in here
[02:08:52] he doesn't know what he's talking about no no that's not what I'm talking about I'm never
[02:08:56] almost never talking about undermining another leader or a leadership team what I'm going to do
[02:09:02] though is I'm going to translate I'm gonna say hey guys our job on this I know echo said that here's
[02:09:08] our job here's here's what our focus needs to be here's the way this translates for us so I'm not
[02:09:15] disparaging you and I'm not even disagreeing with you I'm simply honing the message for my team
[02:09:23] now you still even if you need to do that you're mitigating that as much as possible you
[02:09:29] still have to maintain the critical goal of getting your leadership team aligned and one other
[02:09:36] little tool to help make that happen is to present their words back to them and you said you know
[02:09:44] I wrote down what you said to the team this morning and I just wanted to go through that with you
[02:09:48] and break it down a little bit and then go through it line by line and have the hard conversations
[02:09:56] and make the tough decisions you've got to make the tough decisions and also give a little
[02:10:04] seed some points right be flexible but unify unify the message and there's a worse number
[02:10:15] worst case nearer but there are scenarios where echo and I cannot agree on the message and we
[02:10:20] got to go up the chain of command now I would never want to do that I would never ever want to say to my
[02:10:26] boss hey echo and I can agree you need to make the decision for us to me that's a total failure
[02:10:32] it's a failure in my leadership that I can't get us on the same sheet of music so I don't I can't even
[02:10:39] think of any time that I ever did that went to my boss and said hey boss I can't we you know I can't
[02:10:44] come to a come to a conclusion here with the other task you need to commander so I can't come to a
[02:10:48] conclusion with the other pertune commanders or I can't come to a conclusion with my squad about
[02:10:53] how we should do this I've never done that so you should be able to if you're right you'll win the
[02:10:58] argument and if you're wrong then you change your mind so it's not that it's not like this
[02:11:01] ultimate I like I'm saying I'm great I'm just saying if you're right then you'll win the argument
[02:11:06] and if you're wrong then you'll change your mind so it's not that hard so that's what happens
[02:11:12] needs to happen here with the leadership team we've got to find out who's right and people that are
[02:11:17] right need to convince that people that are wrong now you need to check your ego obviously
[02:11:24] cross the board every team everybody on the teams got to check the ego because a lot of people will
[02:11:29] be holding on to their idea because it's their idea and they love their idea because there's
[02:11:35] egotistical and that's how I would deal with mixed messages coming down the chain of command
[02:11:45] I'm gonna go ahead and just say it that that could have been one of the best lines I've ever heard
[02:11:50] if you're right you'll win the argument if you're wrong you'll change your mind that's a good
[02:11:56] that's a good one you just think that up I did just make it up yeah I mean I guess it's
[02:12:01] something that I've known but right that's what makes it so good because you kind of kind of
[02:12:06] seems like oh yeah you don't write but that's never the case but if you're being on the
[02:12:11] up and up there it is right there there you go echo likes that one we got time for about one more
[02:12:21] I don't see why not juggle you often talk about being on the path what path is that and where does it lead
[02:12:33] I guess the path well I can tell you what path I'm on and what path I strive to stay on
[02:12:48] and that is the war path that that's the path I'm on the war path of war
[02:13:03] because to me war path means moving toward a battle a fight towards war
[02:13:11] and that is what I am doing and that's what I've always been doing
[02:13:21] whether it was the actual war against our nations enemies or the war against my own weaknesses
[02:13:32] that is what I am doing preparing and sharpening my sword and honing my skills and maintaining
[02:13:46] the unmedicated daily discipline in all things and the war path is just that it's a path
[02:13:59] it's a route it leads somewhere and so you ask okay then where does it lead
[02:14:11] and yes yes it can lead to war and that's fine
[02:14:19] in fact I am waiting and I am ready because the war path is a war against weakness and so it leads to strength
[02:14:37] it's a war against ignorance and so it leads to knowledge it's a war against confusion
[02:14:52] and so it delivers understanding and the path the war path leads to
[02:15:04] control and leads to ownership of your life and that to me is the war path the path of fire
[02:15:20] and adversity the path of blood and of sweat and of suffering
[02:15:25] the war path is the preeminent path of discipline which is why it leads to freedom
[02:15:39] and beyond that in the end the war path it leads to peace
[02:15:58] and I think that's all I've got for the night so thanks everyone out there for taking the time to
[02:16:09] listen to this this little podcast we put together and if you like it then you want to support it
[02:16:19] echo and they do that if you're in the mood if you work out
[02:16:29] and I heard this before but if you work out and you want supplements that actually work
[02:16:33] because supplement industry you probably know this bro they can put whatever they want
[02:16:37] and there's no regulation yeah you can I don't know if it was a documentary it's something like
[02:16:44] that word a guy just put chalk that's all it was chalk and there he was like hey look protein powder
[02:16:49] sell it and either he found there was like there was no regulation saying he couldn't do it technically
[02:16:56] anyway this is the whole one thing nonetheless if you want for real ones it's actually not a bad
[02:17:01] product idea we could make protein powder that you can use as chalk so you could be chalking up and
[02:17:08] then eating yeah good no yeah yeah maybe you get on it to make the protein powder chalk up
[02:17:16] yeah that's that's a little bit different from what I was kind of saying but nonetheless if you
[02:17:22] go to on it dot com slash juggle you can get 10% off their their supplements anyway my point
[02:17:27] being with that story is that their supplements are all like legit and you can even read like about
[02:17:32] it like their peel oil I said this before I feel like I said this before but you can see like how
[02:17:38] they harvest them they use like eco friendly boats like it's like it's basically the ones you want
[02:17:44] to go boats no like the engines are like eco friendly and you know like that kind of stuff
[02:17:49] anyway I was watching it you can get it dusted on there but yeah all legit warrior bars
[02:17:54] I feel like we haven't really talked about it in by the way I got asked by somebody on Twitter the
[02:17:59] other day what you know hey my joints are hurting what I take take roll oil that's it man take
[02:18:03] roll oil yeah I've been using kerala oil for a really long time I'm 44 years old I'm almost 45
[02:18:10] years old actually and my joints are doing solid and knock on wood you know I had some joint pain
[02:18:19] in the past and when I started taking kerala oil I'm talking 10 maybe even longer years ago
[02:18:28] the it's I definitely attributed to helping me and also also the one goes to me yeah
[02:18:34] so and that's saying a lot because your big you're a big guy 235 not exactly flexible
[02:18:43] I'm not the most flexible person and I do like that heavy duty stuff I mean get after it
[02:18:52] not as much as I want to and not as much as I should but I try I try to to work out hard
[02:19:00] I train to jitsu I surf I run I sprint I just do all kinds of activities and before
[02:19:08] up until several years ago I was in the military I was in the sealed teams and I was running around
[02:19:15] doing all that crap for my whole life and so yeah I would say order up some kerala oil
[02:19:22] but just saying just doing jitsu alone especially as much as you do it that alone old young whatever
[02:19:29] just doing and you're like my joints are fine if you're in that situation to about that alone yeah
[02:19:35] and and the kerala oil for sure and also I believe that working out period is very helpful
[02:19:42] in staying injury free because I always work out and therefore I'm always moving and therefore
[02:19:48] my joints are getting rusty you know but do both right do both yeah I do get injured you know
[02:19:56] I had the finger injury which is a better now pretty good right now I had I had my shoulder got
[02:20:03] tweaked a little bit yeah but that's the situation that's not me from rolling yeah and that's not
[02:20:08] the kind hey I should have took more krill oil yeah it's not that it's like when you wake up or when
[02:20:13] you when you're like hey I'm gonna go out you start working I don't know I got to warm up some more
[02:20:16] some more you know and I take just FYI I take three of the 500

[02:23:24] that kind of understand stuff yeah people don't want to be bothered if if you're going to send
[02:23:30] something make it be important yeah at least something that I honestly think that you'll be
[02:23:35] interested yes yeah honestly I'm gonna put some thought into that so yeah there it is that's the
[02:23:40] list now in the very very near future like I'm talking maybe a week sure and it's by early
[02:23:49] September 2016 you will be able to order jockel like tea mama granted and you'll be able to order
[02:23:57] it from amazon which is good to go and I got my first batch in and it's not coming drinking a little
[02:24:04] bit of that stuff right now yeah and it's it definitely puts you in the zone
[02:24:12] low place I like to call the assault zone it gets you there so look for it this is you know if
[02:24:18] you heard that first podcast with tempers and he was like what is this adrenaline field drink
[02:24:24] it was white tea and white tea is not loaded with caffeine there's other stuff in there there's magic
[02:24:30] in there there's antioxidants in there it tastes good and anyways so that's common you be able
[02:24:38] to order it we're kind of wondering I'm kind of wanting to see if people want jockel white tea
[02:24:43] I think they do yeah and we will find out shortly I know I do yeah it's that's the interesting thing
[02:24:52] because you know like just kind of on the surface we're like a fuck what's jockel into
[02:24:56] it's not like you know something creates like something it looks like it sounds kind of delicate you know
[02:25:04] white tea well when you see the can that it comes in it's not delicate it's not delicate it's weird
[02:25:09] because I was trying to think of where I discovered it and I actually don't know I actually can't
[02:25:13] remember how why drank it for the first time but when I started drinking I was like oh yeah this
[02:25:20] stuff feels good especially when you're under stress or there's a lack of sleep or
[02:25:25] you need to be mentally sharp it's the deal but you can mix white tea with it'll mess up the taste
[02:25:33] but you mix jockel white tea with elphabrine I've done it I've done it I've done it here in the podcast
[02:25:42] yeah it doesn't mess up the taste it tastes good dang all right well the white tea is is a
[02:25:49] it's not like this super harsh taste it's a it's a it's a not mild because you can taste it
[02:25:55] you can kind of feel it too light yeah it's a light but heavy it's a I don't even know how to describe it
[02:26:01] it's just not it's not a heavy taste yeah so you can mix it with a lot of stuff and you can like I
[02:26:08] said you can be able to get that on Amazon so you click through the get it on Amazon you can also go
[02:26:13] and get by the little book called extreme ownership when you're there yeah and you can get that anywhere
[02:26:20] they wear the sell books you can buy the hardcover you can buy digital audio format which my brother
[02:26:26] life babbin and I actually read you can get it for your people up and down the chain of command your
[02:26:32] friends family whoever does it you think needs to get on board with the program get him a copy that's kind of
[02:26:38] a good initiator form and also October 20th and 21st in San Diego we are having the extreme ownership
[02:26:48] mustard that is also life babbin and myself we're gonna be getting granular granular with the
[02:26:56] combat leadership lessons that we learned on the battlefield and how you apply those lessons in your
[02:27:04] business and in your life now that event is going to be extremely interactive it's more
[02:27:17] knocking behind behind the curtain we're gonna be out front with the troops if you got questions
[02:27:22] we are gonna answer them if you got something you need we're gonna talk about it if you got a
[02:27:28] problem we're gonna come up with a solution I say we because we we're gonna work together we're
[02:27:33] gonna learn I can't wait to see how much I'm gonna learn with the the list of people that are
[02:27:37] coming is awesome it every industry you can imagine every level of leadership you can imagine it's
[02:27:44] just it's really gonna be fired up and late for an iron hammer out the schedule and there's so much
[02:27:51] material and so much good information and so much good content it's gonna be awesome and I cannot
[02:27:56] wait to kick it off all right is you just a part of this schedule you just to is not on the schedule
[02:28:04] but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna basically have a due to situation happening at the gym so the
[02:28:10] event is Thursday Friday so maybe it's gonna be Wednesday night if people come in early maybe it's
[02:28:15] gonna be Saturday if people want to stay or Sunday if you want to stay the weekend yeah so
[02:28:20] or just have them like where they're like you know welcome come to the gym you know like these
[02:28:25] yeah or maybe I just maybe I could just bring some mats to the hotel and do some kind of a
[02:28:31] but no then we got a gym is way better because it's like that it's you know one of the best
[02:28:36] got to do some of the gym so yeah if you want to get the jjitsu together we we're going to get the
[02:28:41] gym and I train jjitsu and San Diego I'm training so we'll be in San Diego we will be training
[02:28:46] we might not be able to do it Thursday night because it's a packed schedule doesn't end
[02:28:52] until late at night but either Wednesday night or probably probably once the monsters over because
[02:29:01] head into the monster I'm gonna be like yeah actually I think we're gonna I haven't event

[02:29:15] and or if you're out here just go home Sunday night and that's kind of just mustard no mustard
[02:29:23] people come in and they're like hey I want to come in that gym yeah the guys have come
[02:29:26] this good max I just just met him and his girlfriend is away for I forget if they're married
[02:29:31] but they came in and he was like yeah you know I just came in whatever so yeah people just come in
[02:29:38] and they just let him in too of course yeah yeah also hey look I know that the monster is expensive
[02:29:47] and in this situation guess what it costs money to put it on it costs money for the hotel room
[02:29:52] the event the event room the food the AV equipment the security logistics all that stuff
[02:29:59] it costs money and the reason that we're investing in it is because we want it to be the best
[02:30:06] we want it to be the best event that you have ever been to that's what I want that's all
[02:30:13] and but that does cost money and so if you can't afford to come out to it you know what
