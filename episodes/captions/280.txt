[00:00:00] Revenge, revenge, revenge.
[00:00:03] Let us kill.
[00:00:05] Let us cut to pieces.
[00:00:07] Let us swim and blood up to our knees.
[00:00:10] Revenge, revenge, revenge.
[00:00:14] Let us wipe the stain from our clothes.
[00:00:21] That is a song taught to Turkish school children as reported by the US Consulate.
[00:00:29] In February of 1915, and this is Jockel Podcast number 280, with echo Charles and me,
[00:00:37] Jockel Willink.
[00:00:38] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:39] Good evening.
[00:00:40] Also, joining us tonight is Darrell Cooper.
[00:00:42] Good evening.
[00:00:48] And the blood spread step by step from Ankara to Distant Cities Towns and Villages.
[00:00:55] At the end of August 1915, a girl barely 13 years old told me of the following to which she
[00:01:03] had been an eyewitness and which she only by some miracle had survived.
[00:01:08] In mid-August, all our menion males from 12 to 80 were arrested, taken out of town and
[00:01:17] killed by unheard of tortures.
[00:01:21] It was the turn of the girls and women.
[00:01:27] On August 20, all the Armenian women, girls and small boys were taken out into more than 70
[00:01:31] carriages and brought to a valley by a bridge an hour and a half away.
[00:01:36] Following these carriages from the town was an armed mob of Turks, each of whom on the
[00:01:42] way chose a sheep or lamb to slaughter.
[00:01:47] And they reached the area under the bridge, police and soldiers having joined the savage
[00:01:52] mob set upon these poor, defenseless women, mothers, brides, virgins and children.
[00:02:03] Just as spring trees are cut down with bill hooked, hedge knives, the blood thirsty mob
[00:02:09] attacked this group more than 400.
[00:02:14] With axes, hatchets, shovels and pitchforks, hacking off their appendages, noses, ears, legs,
[00:02:21] arms, fingers, shoulders, they dash the little children against the rocks before their
[00:02:26] eyes of their mothers while shouting, Allah, Allah.
[00:02:36] The screams of the mothers and virgins and little children echoed across the valley in
[00:02:40] the surrounding rocky hills and caves that children screamed, may rig, may rig, mother,
[00:02:47] mother, help us please.
[00:02:51] But the mob indifferent continued to rip apart the bodies so that even the stones cried
[00:03:00] out.
[00:03:05] And we after four to five hours of carnage and plunder, nights black, blanket covered this
[00:03:10] scene of blood which would stir the envy of wild animals.
[00:03:18] With the fall of night, the Turkish mob, police and police soldiers returned to town with
[00:03:23] their bundles of loot, whatever they had left.
[00:03:27] Hyenas, wolves, jackals and other scavengers came off to finish.
[00:03:36] The precipices of the valley were strewn with corpses naked or half naked.
[00:03:43] It was a scene beyond all human imagination.
[00:03:49] Now in then, in the darkness of the night, the moans and groans of the badly wounded, then
[00:03:55] the raspy drone of those giving up the ghost could be heard.
[00:04:03] After midnight, in the thick darkness, a refreshing dew began to fall.
[00:04:10] And behold, a slightly wounded, numb little girl, invigorated by the dew woke up.
[00:04:20] After alive, she began to roll over and search for mother and two sisters.
[00:04:27] In vain, she called them by name, but alas they were gone to eternal sleep.
[00:04:34] At last, she found their crushed bodies which had fallen one beside the other.
[00:04:43] In shock, the girl began to shake and sob uncontrollably.
[00:04:46] Her teeth chattering, she did not move from that spot until morning, as if the bodies
[00:04:50] of her mother and her older sisters compelled her to stay there.
[00:04:59] At dawn, a few of the Kurdish cowhurters crossing the bridge in the vicinity of this
[00:05:05] carnage saw one of the corpses moving in the distance.
[00:05:11] They approached her, took pity on her, and brought her home to their father's care.
[00:05:19] Being an anti-turk Muslim Kurdish, he secretly turned her over to his long-time friend.
[00:05:27] It was with the arrival of this little girl in the town where we were staying that for
[00:05:31] the first time, we became aware of the extent of the killing being carried out around
[00:05:37] us without a sound or whisperer.
[00:05:44] And that is an excerpt from a book called Armenian Golgotha by a man named Gregoris Polakian.
[00:06:02] And then Gregoris was born in 1875 in Tocat, part of the Ottoman Empire, educated in Germany.
[00:06:16] Eventually became a celibate priest in the Armenian apostolic church.
[00:06:25] He was one of the countless Armenians who suffered through the Armenian genocide.
[00:06:33] He was one of the lucky ones that actually survived and he wrote a book about his experiences.
[00:06:39] And like I said, the book is called Armenian Golgotha.
[00:06:43] If you don't know what Golgotha is, Golgotha is the name of the hill where Jesus was crucified.
[00:06:55] And this event is where the Armenians as a people were crucified and where as individuals
[00:07:05] for many a mere crucifixion would have been merciful.
[00:07:14] But before we jump into more of the book, I wanted to go into some of the background.
[00:07:21] And this event is not as well known as some other genocides.
[00:07:29] So Darrell, let's talk about how we got here.
[00:07:32] And what are some of the similarities and differences about what happened to the Armenians
[00:07:38] and what has happened to some other persecuted groups in the past?
[00:07:44] What's the background here?
[00:07:46] There's some people that called the 20th century the century of genocide.
[00:07:53] You look all throughout history and there's no shortage of mass killing of human beings
[00:07:57] by other human beings.
[00:08:00] In fact, if you go all the way back to like our tribal times, warfare by genocide was
[00:08:05] pretty typical.
[00:08:06] You had nomadic tribes, they didn't have prisons, they didn't have jails, they didn't have
[00:08:09] POW camps or anything like that.
[00:08:11] If you conquered another tribe, their men were going to be a problem and you didn't have
[00:08:15] any way to keep them.
[00:08:16] And so the standard operating procedure was you just took them out, took the women that
[00:08:20] were willing to sort of, I guess, get over it back to your tribe with you, raise the children
[00:08:25] as your own.
[00:08:28] Almost like social mammals, like lions, somebody comes in, kills the male lion and now takes
[00:08:33] over the pride.
[00:08:35] As time developed, you started to get a sort of systematic civilized level of mass killing
[00:08:43] at scale that had never been possible in tribal times that you could only really, you could
[00:08:49] only manage with the same sort of administration and organization that allowed you to do
[00:08:55] things like build pyramids and all the great wonders of civilization.
[00:08:59] When you get up to the modern times, you get something that's even a little bit more,
[00:09:04] a little bit different than that.
[00:09:07] If we think back to say the Romans, what they did to Carthage had been giving Rome problems,
[00:09:13] and the rebel had been rampaging around the Italian peninsula, defeating their armies.
[00:09:16] And when they finally got to drop on the Carthage Indians, they said, salt the earth.
[00:09:20] We're not dealing with this anymore.
[00:09:22] Eliminate that threat for good and they did.
[00:09:25] When Caesar went up to Gaul, Rome had been sacked by Gaul before.
[00:09:29] It was a traumatic event in Roman history.
[00:09:31] And so when Caesar went up there and ended that threat thoroughly, you could think of it in
[00:09:36] a similar way.
[00:09:37] It was attached to conquest.
[00:09:39] And that's what you kind of saw throughout history.
[00:09:42] You get up to the 20th century, you see something in a way that's different and much darker,
[00:09:47] I think, which is you have established firmly established states, annihilating internal
[00:09:55] enemies according to the state, attacking captive populations over which they have complete
[00:10:01] power and control.
[00:10:03] You're not going in and eliminating a threat that exists over the horizon, making sure that
[00:10:07] it never returns.
[00:10:09] Now you're going into a prison where everybody's kept in a cell and one by one, these
[00:10:14] unarmed people, you're simply murdering all of these people over whom you have complete
[00:10:19] power.
[00:10:21] When you think of what happened to the Armenians, when you think of what happened to the
[00:10:25] Ukrainians under Stalin, to the Jews under Hitler, these are the kinds of things you see.
[00:10:29] This is a disarmed captive population that is not a threat.
[00:10:34] And there's no way out.
[00:10:38] And that's really the key characteristic of these events.
[00:10:40] Is if you go to those people and you saw this, you saw this with the Jews in Germany,
[00:10:45] you saw this with the Ukrainians, you saw this with the Armenians.
[00:10:48] Absolutely at the beginning of the First World War is a huge part of the population, including
[00:10:53] the leadership, is really actively asking the question, what can we do?
[00:10:57] What can we do?
[00:10:58] Like, what is it?
[00:10:59] It's the beginning of the First World War, the Armenians were flying Turkish flags,
[00:11:04] tens of thousands of them went right away enjoying the Turkish military, because they knew
[00:11:08] they had a history with the Turks.
[00:11:10] They had problems before, 20 years back, we'll talk about in a second, 300,000 or so of them
[00:11:15] got massacred.
[00:11:17] And they knew in the First World War, the tension was going to be high and the stress
[00:11:20] was going to be high.
[00:11:21] So what can we do?
[00:11:23] To show our loyalty to the Empire, to show that we're down for the cause.
[00:11:27] And the answer is, there's nothing you can do.
[00:11:29] There's nothing you can do.
[00:11:31] You're all going to be wiped out and there's nothing you can do.
[00:11:35] And it's the ultimate horror movie to have your state turn on you like that.
[00:11:43] And it's interesting that you say that the Armenian genocide isn't that well known, which
[00:11:49] is very, very true.
[00:11:52] Because it really is kind of the archetypal act of genocide in the 20th century.
[00:11:56] It was really like the first one early in the century that set the tone for all of the
[00:12:01] ones that came afterwards.
[00:12:03] And it was one of the most thorough and complete and systematic and intentional genocides
[00:12:08] that we have any record of.
[00:12:14] That erasure of genocide is something that you also see throughout history.
[00:12:17] I mean, how many countless people have been genocided throughout history that we don't
[00:12:21] even know their names.
[00:12:23] We'll never know their names.
[00:12:26] Maybe we even celebrate the history of the people who did it as a glorious civilization.
[00:12:31] And we will never know the names of the countless people that they completely wiped out.
[00:12:36] It's something that we don't like to mention or talk about or admit, but the fact is that
[00:12:43] more often than not if you look historically speaking, genocide tends to work.
[00:12:48] Not only are a lot of genocides physically successful, but more often than we would really
[00:12:55] prefer the one that does it ends up getting away with it and getting the message put
[00:13:04] out to the rest of the world and people in the future who might think of doing something
[00:13:08] similar that this is an option.
[00:13:10] In fact, when Adolf Hitler was contemplating his final solution for the Jewish question
[00:13:15] in Eastern Europe, he asked his commanding generals who today remembers the Armenians.
[00:13:22] Because the truth was nobody did.
[00:13:24] It's also interesting that in World War I there was plenty of Jews that fought for Germany.
[00:13:33] Well over 100,000.
[00:13:35] Valiantly, by the way.
[00:13:39] Hitler's life was saved by a Jewish soldier.
[00:13:42] He received his iron cross from a Jewish superior officer.
[00:13:50] So, as we push through this, let's talk about the relationship a little bit of the Turkish
[00:13:59] people and the Armenians in terms of how do we end up here?
[00:14:04] You know, I mentioned that it is really the archetypal genocide of the 20th century.
[00:14:09] I don't just say that because of the methods that were used, in fact, the methods that
[00:14:14] were used in a way where kind of an agronistic and unique to the Turkish Empire.
[00:14:18] It was archetypal of the 20th century genocides because of what you just asked.
[00:14:24] Because of the specific relationship between the dominant majority group and this particular
[00:14:29] Armenian minority.
[00:14:32] The Turks, the Ottoman Empire is a strange thing to study when you get up to the late
[00:14:38] period in the 20th century.
[00:14:39] Because if you ever asked yourself, what would it have been like if the gold and
[00:14:44] hoard or the Mongols or something had just they had managed to establish themselves somewhere
[00:14:50] on the outskirts of Europe and they lasted.
[00:14:53] You get all the way up to the 20th century and they're still there and they have an advanced
[00:14:56] civilization.
[00:14:57] Now, the gangas cons like descendants like they now have control, they have a big battle
[00:15:02] fleet, they've got modern weaponry, I mean it's a big glorious civilization, Constantinople.
[00:15:07] You know, when the first world war kicked off, you're talking about one of the most sophisticated
[00:15:14] glorious cities in the world.
[00:15:17] And the out of an empire gives you some idea of what it would be like if the golden
[00:15:22] hoard survived into the 20th century.
[00:15:25] This is, you know, their Turkic peoples who came in as step warriors and conquered the Byzantine
[00:15:31] empire and took over all of North Africa, basically everything between Morocco and Persia
[00:15:36] and then down into Egypt.
[00:15:38] And so what you end up in a situation like this is you end up with like a war like people,
[00:15:46] right?
[00:15:47] That's what they are.
[00:15:48] When what they respect is war and being warriors and that sort of becomes the most
[00:15:55] respected class of people.
[00:15:57] Oh, yeah.
[00:15:58] Yeah, the idea in the major Islamic empires was always that we the majority population, the
[00:16:05] people in the commanding position of this society, we fight the wars and everybody else,
[00:16:11] the Christian and Jewish minority, for example, they pay for the wars.
[00:16:14] And that's how it works.
[00:16:15] We're a warrior people.
[00:16:16] I mean, these are step warriors who came and built up a big civilization and they kept
[00:16:22] a lot of that character even as they went forward, even as they were wearing suits and ties
[00:16:27] and, you know, going to to big security conferences and international conferences in Europe
[00:16:34] and the United States, they still had that in them.
[00:16:36] This was a warrior people from an age where it was perfectly typical to offer your enemies
[00:16:45] the option to either unconditionally surrender or be massacred totally.
[00:16:51] There was the mode of warfare on the step when they were conquering civilizations.
[00:16:54] It's how the Ottoman Empire got to where it was.
[00:16:57] And so as you move into modernity, you have this society there that up until you're
[00:17:04] still the early 1800s, still had its entire bureaucracy, governmental bureaucracy and most of
[00:17:11] its military, like its serious military officers, were still people who had been taken as slaves
[00:17:17] as children and brought back for that specific function.
[00:17:20] They would go up to the Balkans, they would go up into the Caucasus area because according
[00:17:24] to Islamic law, you can't in slave fellow Muslims.
[00:17:27] And so they would go into Christian areas and just go into a village and say, we need 10 people,
[00:17:32] we need 10 male children, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
[00:17:35] And they would do it the easy way because they knew what the hard way looked like, under
[00:17:38] the Ottoman Empire and it was no prettier than it got in the 20th century.
[00:17:43] And by the time they got up to the early 1800s, this group of bureaucrats and soldiers called
[00:17:50] the Janissaries, these were slave soldiers and bureaucrats who more or less ran the important
[00:17:56] functions of the empire.
[00:17:58] By the time you got up to the late 17 early 1800s, they were in fact running large sections
[00:18:02] of the economy.
[00:18:04] They held all the most important government positions and they were getting into this kind
[00:18:08] of strange place with the ruling elites, the ruling Turkish elites where the Turks are
[00:18:14] overall in charge.
[00:18:16] But this other group of people who are Muslim, they were born Christian children, but
[00:18:19] they were converted as children to Muslims.
[00:18:21] But that this identifiable group of people who has their own sense of themselves as an
[00:18:26] identifiable group, these Janissaries, that they have a tremendous amount of influence
[00:18:30] in power, that they're really the ones running the empire.
[00:18:33] And it got to a point where the government, the Turkish government, decided they couldn't
[00:18:36] trust these people anymore and they locked them all in their barracks one night and they
[00:18:39] burned them all the death.
[00:18:42] When they felt that this small minority group was accruing too much power and middle
[00:18:47] management where they kind of maybe probably could run the empire without the Turks if
[00:18:51] they really wanted to, their response was to wipe all of those people out overnight.
[00:18:57] And that's what they did.
[00:18:58] And it's known in Ottoman history, it was known in Ottoman history as the auspicious event.
[00:19:03] This is like a bunch of, let's say UFC fighters that are training hard, they fight, they
[00:19:12] punch each other, they kick each other, they wrestle and their agents and promoters are out
[00:19:19] there doing the work that they looked down upon, have not some promoter, I'm not some
[00:19:23] age and I'm the fighter.
[00:19:25] And then one day they look up and they go, wait a second, why is that guy driving a freaking
[00:19:30] unmercadies S class and I'm over here in a Toyota Camry and they get together and say,
[00:19:36] we're not going to do this anymore.
[00:19:41] That's one way to look at it.
[00:19:42] I mean, so in the thing that's so interesting about it, right, is if you look at what
[00:19:45] happened to the overseas Chinese population in Indonesia in the 1960s, if you look at what
[00:19:50] happened to the East Indian population of East Africa in the 1970s under like Idiamin and
[00:19:57] some others, if you look at what happened to the Jews in Europe, if there, there, you
[00:20:04] can go down the line.
[00:20:05] The people who are targeted are almost inevitably this similar group of people, right, if
[00:20:10] you look in Europe with the Jews for a long time, we were under a feudal system, the
[00:20:16] people who were in charge, the elites in a feudal system, they own all the land, the source
[00:20:21] of wealth in society is from the land, the majority of the local European population are
[00:20:26] all peasants or maybe small artisans.
[00:20:30] But then you have this group move in, you have the Jews move in and the Jews have been living
[00:20:33] in cities since the Romans kicked them out of Palestine, some of you even before that.
[00:20:37] So these are people who have lived in urban environment, they know how to engage in long
[00:20:42] distance trade, they know how to deal in like financial alchemy, they know how to do all,
[00:20:47] they know banking, they know law, they're all literate at a time when like 1% of your own
[00:20:52] population is literate because that's what these people do and they don't have their own
[00:20:55] place to live obviously.
[00:20:57] And so they go from place to place trying to survive saying what can we do here?
[00:21:00] We can't own land, only the nobility owns land, that's fine and the peasants work
[00:21:04] the land, but I'll bet you there's a lot of ways that we can help out and they bounced
[00:21:09] around Europe sometimes, accruing too much power, too much wealth and getting run out of
[00:21:13] their territory because the king decided he doesn't want to pay his debts or something
[00:21:17] like that, but that's how they survived, right?
[00:21:20] And it was fine, they fulfilled this middleman minority role for centuries and it was a role
[00:21:27] that sort of needed to be filled at a time when societies were kind of building themselves
[00:21:31] up to become more complex and sophisticated and didn't have that indigenous capacity.
[00:21:37] But then you get up to say that 1800s, maybe late 1700s depending on where you are and you
[00:21:43] have all these Jews who are engaged in things like banking, law, medicine, international
[00:21:50] trade, all of these things that the nobility didn't want to do and the peasants were
[00:21:54] incapable of doing and they're like, we'll just have the Jews do it because we don't
[00:21:57] like them anyway, their outsiders have them do it.
[00:22:00] We get up to like the 1800s and 1900s, what's every mother telling their kid that they
[00:22:04] should go do?
[00:22:05] Go be a lawyer, go be a banker, go be a doctor and so they were in prime position that
[00:22:09] when society started to change and the economy started to change, they were ready, they
[00:22:14] had been doing this stuff for a long time and they started to become very wealthy and
[00:22:18] very prominent and when that started to happen, you got a gigantic spike in antisemitism,
[00:22:25] you started seeing pogroms all over the place.
[00:22:28] You have this perfect storm too where you have like the nobility elite class who's turning
[00:22:33] against them and you also have the peasantry that says, wait a second, these people have
[00:22:38] all this money and it doesn't take very long for the nobility to lead the peasantry
[00:22:42] against the whatever class we're talking about, we could be talking about the Jews, we
[00:22:46] could be talking about the Armenians.
[00:22:48] 100% especially since it redirects any anger they might have toward the people in charge
[00:22:53] to that layer below that intermediary and they would specifically use it for that purpose,
[00:22:58] you know, they would use these people as tax collectors, they would use them as a state
[00:23:01] managers to manage the surfs and stuff because they knew that if things got out of hand,
[00:23:07] you know, and the peasant's rise up we can be like, yeah, you know, we knew that those
[00:23:10] Jews were were trouble all along, so go ahead, go nuts and that happened over and over
[00:23:16] again throughout European history.
[00:23:18] So the Armenians followed a similar path, so after the janissaries, right, now this
[00:23:26] means we now picked up where we killed the janissaries, now we need someone else to kind of
[00:23:30] it kind of come in here and run that run.
[00:23:32] So it's sort of worked out like that, but the Christians had always kind of been fulfilling
[00:23:35] those roles, right?
[00:23:37] The Christians and all the Islamic empires, if you go back and the Jews as well, they're usually
[00:23:42] urban populations, our Armenians are a little different and that's in that respect, we'll
[00:23:45] talk about in a second, but they were the ones who who naturally fulfilled those roles, the
[00:23:49] Turks, they were the warriors, you know, they're not going to go open the shop, you know, they're
[00:23:53] not doing banking and then you've got a lot of, you know, you got the Kurdish tribes, you've got
[00:23:57] these a lot of these semi-nomadic Arab villagers and stuff who were out there, you know, the
[00:24:01] Ottoman Empire is not, we're not talking about like England in the 1900s or something.
[00:24:06] It's a very sophisticated and advanced society in many ways, but you go like maybe 500 miles
[00:24:11] out to the east and it's a wild fricking west down there, you know, I mean it is like you got
[00:24:17] Armenian village surrounded by Kurdish tribes that raid that village sometimes in kidnapped your
[00:24:22] daughters and you know, you go outside the imperial corps and the Ottoman Empire did not have the
[00:24:27] state capacity to really exercise firm control over all of their lands. You know, it was a tribute
[00:24:32] empire which is again reminiscent of the old step empires, like we're not going to come in and tell
[00:24:37] you that you got a turn Turkish and you can't speak your language, just send your taxes and don't,
[00:24:42] you know, have any uprisings and if you do will come and you'll learn why the last 10 people
[00:24:47] found out that's a bad idea. Now that was really how it was. It was a tribute empire and the Christians
[00:24:53] and the Jews, Christians were more numerical than the Jews and so they really, and in the Ottoman
[00:24:58] context, when I say that we're talking mostly about Armenians and the East Greeks in the West
[00:25:04] and then a Syrians kind of spread out or a Syrian Christians as well. And by the time, a very similar
[00:25:10] thing, they had been engaging in these middleman roles, right, administrative, professional and
[00:25:17] commercial services for the empire, stuff that the empire couldn't do in its own. Things like
[00:25:22] almost of the biggest mosques that East Endworld's famous for today were all designed by Armenians,
[00:25:28] Armenian architects. By the time you got up to the late 18 early 1900s, you've got the bureaucracy,
[00:25:33] largely filling the upper roles very often filled with, I shouldn't say, and the very, very upper roles,
[00:25:39] those are Ottoman rulers, but all of these sort of middlemanagement sort of GS14 roles, right?
[00:25:45] Those are Armenians, those are Greeks, you know, people like that. They really relied on these people.
[00:25:50] And it was a similar thing. You get up into the dawn of the modern age. We're having bureaucratic
[00:25:55] skills, being literate and numerate, knowing how to deal with finance and trade and law and medicine,
[00:26:00] all of these things that the Christians and the Ottoman Empire were doing. That's where you needed
[00:26:04] to be if you were going to be successful. And they became extraordinarily successful in the Ottoman Empire.
[00:26:10] Very, very wealthy. At one point, I mean, in fact, just before the outbreak of the first world war,
[00:26:15] the most, the wealthiest banker in Europe was an Ottoman Armenian. And we're wealthy, then,
[00:26:20] the Rothchild's even. And when you get to that point, you get, you run into that,
[00:26:27] into that trouble where you have this empire, where the ruling elites, the Turkish elites,
[00:26:35] are experiencing this sense that they aren't really needed so much anymore. Now, they don't
[00:26:42] feel that. They're not going to think that consciously ever, but that's really what's going on.
[00:26:45] They're in charge now of an empire that they couldn't have really built themselves. And they couldn't
[00:26:50] really run themselves. And the people who are running it, they're starting to look at various skew
[00:26:56] for a very particular reason. And that was that this is also the age of European imperialism.
[00:27:03] You know, one of our unraveling episodes recently, we talked about the genocide of the Weagers.
[00:27:07] And you go back to the late 1800s. And the Weagers kind of became the dominant majority in
[00:27:13] Xinjiang. And that, I got annihilated for my mispronunciation of that word.
[00:27:18] But we'll have to do that in the United States. I must have got freedom.
[00:27:20] But what was I saying? I think you said Xinjiang, now I'm just messing with you. And
[00:27:30] the Weagers were in the territory. And they were being kind of oppressed by this dominant
[00:27:34] group there. And so the Xinjiang East said Roger that. And they went out and just wiped those
[00:27:37] people out. They were called the Zungars. And they don't exist anymore. And really one of the big
[00:27:43] drivers for that was, you know, we had talked about how in China, outside their borders. Well,
[00:27:49] what we think of as their borders today, they never thought about it as like a hard border
[00:27:52] back in the day. It was just that was the frontier. Past that is the step. That's where all
[00:27:56] the barbarians live. Yeah, their word for border literally meant like frontier. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:28:00] And so what they need to do is just they need to manage the barbarians out there.
[00:28:05] It's just one big buffer zone between us and them. Well, all of a sudden you start getting
[00:28:10] the British Empire, the French, later the Russian Empire, these other Europeans start coming
[00:28:15] around in any territory they see that's not already incorporated within the borders of a
[00:28:20] state that can actually defend it. They're snatching all that up. And so the Chinese say,
[00:28:25] well, okay, that's not just the frontier anymore. Now that's China. And anybody in it has to be
[00:28:30] Chinese because if you're anything but that, well, then you're somebody you're a wedge that
[00:28:36] the British, whoever might be able to come up and, you know, drive it with, yeah, bargain with.
[00:28:41] And so when these European powers start picking away at the periphery of the Ottoman Empire
[00:28:47] and then really start to close the walls in, and these Christian Europe, obviously,
[00:28:52] and they have a Christian minority population Greeks and Armenians and others who have not
[00:28:57] been treated particularly well over the years as a whole. And so they start to worry that these
[00:29:03] are potential fifth columnists that these European powers could use to start to split off more
[00:29:07] territory than they already have. So they've already got that in their heads. As we roll into world war
[00:29:17] one, is that, is that, you know, um, an appropriate thing? Is that appropriate assessment?
[00:29:22] Oh, yeah, oh, for sure. Yeah, and actually it existed before that. So when you go back to,
[00:29:26] you know, you think, I think you really have to put yourself in the mindset of the people
[00:29:30] running the Ottoman Empire and I think we can actually probably do that because we're Americans,
[00:29:35] right? And so you have to imagine, these are people who, again, had the largest and most powerful
[00:29:42] empire in the world for a number of years. I mean, they drove all the way up to Vienna twice.
[00:29:47] You go look at a map of Europe, everybody out there and I mean, if you know, it's not like
[00:29:51] there in the Balkans. It's up there in Central Europe. I mean, and if they would have, if they would have
[00:29:55] gotten past Vienna, I mean, you know, Germany was just broken into a bunch of little principalities at
[00:30:00] the time and they weren't standing up. Ottomans were on good terms with the French. I mean,
[00:30:04] they may have conquered like, you know, two thirds of Europe if they hadn't been stopped by the
[00:30:08] poles of Vienna. And so you have this empire that's not only the largest, most powerful empire
[00:30:15] in the world for centuries, it controls like its capital, is constant, the noble, the old Roman capital,
[00:30:20] you know, it controls access to the Black Sea, it has dominance over the entire eastern Mediterranean,
[00:30:26] controls access between the east and west, you know, trade routes, and then all of a sudden,
[00:30:33] you know, starting kind of, really after that 1683 fight at Vienna that they lost, it was just a
[00:30:38] gradual and then accelerating downhill slide from there. They lose, they start getting shipped away
[00:30:43] in North Africa, eventually they lose all that. They lose Egypt. The Russian empire finally
[00:30:48] starts to get its act together, takes over all of the North Caucasus and wars there. The Russians
[00:30:53] are expanding, you know, you have Orthodox Christians in the Balkans, the Russian empire is pushing
[00:30:58] down there. They lose their Balkan territories over time. They lose Bulgaria. And so you have this empire
[00:31:05] that is, you know, you have to imagine being an American and it's like, yeah, Vietnam was tough,
[00:31:11] Iraq and Afghanistan were tough. Oh, no Mexico just invaded and took over New Mexico Arizona and
[00:31:17] Southern California and there's nothing we can do about it. And now Cuba took over Florida and
[00:31:23] there's nothing we can do about it. Like, that's lost, it's gone now. And there's this
[00:31:28] growing sense that it's not going to reverse any time soon, if ever, that this is like an
[00:31:33] inexorable process of collapse that's going on. And because it's being done by these European
[00:31:41] imperialists of the ones chipping away at a Christian Europe and because of the fact that their
[00:31:46] own Christian minorities had been mistreated for centuries, the, you know, there was this sort of
[00:31:57] sense of hope among some of those Christian minorities that may be, hey, you know, where the
[00:32:01] Armenians over here in the East, it's not great to be an Eastern and Ottoman Armenian out in the
[00:32:06] rural areas in the East. The Russian empire, their Orthodox Christians, there's a bunch of
[00:32:10] Armenians that live over in the Russian empire and they're actually doing all right. They're not
[00:32:13] getting massacred by the tens of thousands. They're not having to pay taxes to, you know, the
[00:32:18] eight Kurdish chiefdans that all live around us. And so there was some of this, you know, these
[00:32:24] people weren't organized fifth columnists or anything like that. But there was this sort of sense
[00:32:28] that things might be a little bit better if they weren't living under the Ottoman Yoke. That wasn't,
[00:32:32] you know, completely invented. When after the 1877 war between the Russians and the Turks,
[00:32:41] they lost Bulgaria, a bunch of Muslim refugees came out of Bulgaria and came and moved into the
[00:32:46] Ottoman Empire. They also lost a bunch of their North Caucasian territory and a bunch of Strakasi
[00:32:51] and Muslims and other Muslim tribes from up there had to be pushed, you know, they, they, they,
[00:32:56] they fled because the classics were harassing them and stuff. And so they start coming down
[00:33:00] in a lot of them settled in this area where Armenians had traditionally lived. The whole
[00:33:04] area of South Eastern Turkey today, you know, Armenia is right across the Eastern border, but
[00:33:10] you go across the border, that whole area of South Eastern Turkey where it's mostly Kurds today.
[00:33:14] That, that for many, many centuries was all Armenians for the most part. That's traditional like
[00:33:18] Armenia. And, um, yet all of these others that moved into this territory and they started having
[00:33:24] problems with the local Armenian population. Right at this time where the Turkish government is
[00:33:29] starting to look at its Christian minorities and specifically the Armenians with a great deal of
[00:33:33] suspicion. And so, you start to get, you know, you start to get this dynamic where, you know,
[00:33:42] there's multiple things that play. They don't trust the Armenian population out there and they're
[00:33:47] mistreating them, which is leading to a certain sense of resentment from those Armenians toward the
[00:33:51] government. The government doesn't have the state capacity to go out there and really like
[00:33:56] set up shop and establish order out there. You have all of these destitute new Muslim refugees,
[00:34:01] including a lot of them are just tribes or Kurdish tribes and things, no mads who, again,
[00:34:07] their refugees, they don't have a lot going on. And so they start robbing and raiding the Armenian
[00:34:11] settlements that are out there. And the Turkish government either lacks the will or the capacity
[00:34:16] to defend them or to go out and punish them. And so Armenian self defense movement start to basically
[00:34:22] pop up just so they can defend themselves from these Kurdish raids and Circassian raids.
[00:34:26] Well, the Turkish government sees that. They say, you see, they're arming up. They just kill
[00:34:31] the bunch of Muslims from that Kurdish tribe over there. We knew it. We knew they're getting ready for
[00:34:36] rebellion. And it was just this vicious cycle that started to kick into place to the point where
[00:34:42] by the time you get to the 1880s, 1890s, you mentioned that song at the beginning that the Turkish
[00:34:46] schoolchildren who being taught during the First World War. There was an account I read from an
[00:34:51] American missionary that saw in a Turkish classroom, talking like, first, second, third grade kids.
[00:34:57] And they're going through lessons where they've got drawings up on the board, like cartoon drawings
[00:35:03] of Armenians, including women and children participating, just hacking limbs off of Turks and
[00:35:09] you know, raping them, killing them and just the most bloody and horrible ways and these
[00:35:14] schoolchildren who being taught that this is who these Armenians are. This is what they want to do to you.
[00:35:19] And so this had been by the time you get to the First World War, this kind of thing had been going
[00:35:23] on for decades. And the Armenians didn't have, you know, it didn't come to them as a complete
[00:35:30] and total shock, a lot of them anyway, because they had seen a sort of premonition of it in the
[00:35:35] 1890s when the Sultan Abdul Hamid II infamous in Ottoman and Armenian history, ordered a series of
[00:35:45] massacres starting in 1894 that, you know, what can you say? It was just a, it was a free-for-all
[00:35:53] total massacre. You know, there were soldiers in John Darm, John Darm's who were participating,
[00:35:59] but really it was a call on the local populations, Muslim villagers and tribes to get out there
[00:36:05] and participate, kill your Armenian neighbors. And they, and they was specific to the Armenians.
[00:36:09] There were some cases in fact, and this happened as well in the First World War genocide,
[00:36:14] where there are telegrams out there, messages from the government letting them know,
[00:36:18] hey, don't mess with the Catholics, make sure that you don't mess with, you know, these others,
[00:36:23] this is about the Armenians. And they butcher maybe 200,000 people over the course of about
[00:36:30] 18 months, and another 100,000 or so died in the years. So after that from starvation and exposure
[00:36:37] and whatever. And so this is something where, you know, they're not going into cities and rounding up
[00:36:41] 20, 30,000 people at a time. They're going village to village to village 50 people here. 100 people
[00:36:45] here. You look at the map of the massacres in the 1894, a million massacres. And the whole thing is
[00:36:52] just covered with like skulls and cross bones or whatever symbol they used to say, massacres,
[00:36:56] massacres, massacres, just all of eastern Anatolia was just in covered in blood. You know,
[00:37:03] the local population was basically mobilized to go out there and kill your Armenian neighbors.
[00:37:08] And that's what happened. So that's 18 late 1800s. And now we start to get into, I mean,
[00:37:15] it's the next major phase when World War One kicks off. And yeah, there's an important
[00:37:21] interlude there. Like the reason that they stopped killing them. You know, there's a book that
[00:37:25] came out recently called the 30-year genocide by Benny Morris and George Zevy, which is
[00:37:31] two Israeli historians who looked real deeply on this and got. They probably went deeper into the
[00:37:36] into the records to figure out exactly moment by moment like what happened here than anyone really
[00:37:42] has. And one of the things that they discovered is that, you know, this was not something that just
[00:37:46] popped up in the chaos of World War One. That those massacres in the 1890s, there's only one
[00:37:52] reason that they stopped. And that was that the British made them stop. There was, there was,
[00:37:58] you know, by this point, the Ottoman Empire was having huge economic problems. The British and the
[00:38:02] French were essentially had the Empire's finances and receivership. They were basically controlling the
[00:38:07] Ottoman fiscal budget, the governmental fiscal budget, had, you know, say so over it anyway. And
[00:38:15] in 1896, this Armenian militant group, after all of these murders said, we have to do something.
[00:38:22] And there's nothing you can really do. I mean, you know, you can't, you're talking about,
[00:38:26] it's not even David and Goliath. I mean, it's a flee versus Goliath. They can't fight back. There's
[00:38:30] nothing like that. The only thing they can hope to do is get the attention of outside powers
[00:38:34] who can wield influence over the Ottoman Empire. And so they say, well, what is it we can do to
[00:38:38] actually get the attention of these people? What are they? What are the British care about?
[00:38:42] And so they went and they invaded the Ottoman Central Bank, the Bank Ottoman in Constantinople,
[00:38:48] and they took a bunch of hostages and made a bunch of demands. And they knew that there were a lot
[00:38:56] of European hostages that they would be taking and that there were a lot of European assets in that
[00:39:02] bank. And so the Sultan at the time, he's, you know, again, these are these are step warriors. He's
[00:39:09] a hardcore people. He said, yeah, that's nice. Your demands, that's cool. You can throw them away.
[00:39:13] And he just surrounded the place with artillery and got ready to just blow the place to rub
[00:39:17] up all and at the same time put out an order for everybody to enconstant an opal to just go
[00:39:22] out and mask her Armenians and Constantinople. And that's what they did. They rampaged through
[00:39:25] streets, beating, killing. Anybody they could find has he prepared to just blow up this bank.
[00:39:31] And ready to the critical moment, the British sent some warships into the Dardenels there
[00:39:36] and sent a message to the Sultan that if you blow up that bank, the next thing it's going to
[00:39:39] be destroyed as your own house. And so they backed down, but that's the only reason those things
[00:39:44] stopped and he put an order out that the maskers are over and they came to an end. That period,
[00:39:50] though, up until you get to the first World War, most, you know, people who look at this seriously
[00:39:54] now realize that the first World War was not a reason for the Armenian genocide. It was just
[00:40:00] the opportunity for it. This some late 1890s, there's actually, you know, we can talk about what
[00:40:10] it was like. We can sort of throw some words on it, but there's probably nothing better than
[00:40:13] going back to the book that we're talking about, Armenian gogaatha, talking about some of that stuff
[00:40:21] that took place in the 1890s, going back to the book. The massacre began on the morning of December
[00:40:29] 28. The governor sent word to non-Armenian Christians to assemble in their churches and not
[00:40:35] stir out and refrain from sheltering Armenians. The troops were then drawn up at the entrances
[00:40:42] to the Armenian quarter. Behind them, an armed Muslim mob gathered, while the Minorets were crowded
[00:40:50] with Muslims evidently in expectation of some stirring event. The Turkish women too crowded
[00:40:57] onto the roofs and slopes of the fortress which overlooked the Armenian quarter. The mob was
[00:41:02] cheered on by the women who kept up the well-known peculiar throat noise used on such occasions
[00:41:09] by Oriental women to discourage, to encourage their braves. At around noon, a mousin cried out
[00:41:20] in the midday prayer as a glittering glass ornament resembling a crescent was seen shining
[00:41:26] from the top of the fortress overlooking the town, a mullah wave, degreen banner from a tall
[00:41:31] minaret overhanging the other end of town, shots were fired and a trumpet sounded the attack.
[00:41:41] The soldiers opened their ranks so that the mob could pour into the quarter.
[00:41:47] The governor, Nazif, was seen motioning the crowd on. The mob guided by troops who had familiarized
[00:41:54] themselves with the quarter during the siege. A body of wood cutters armed with axes led the way,
[00:42:04] breaking down the doors, soldiers then rushed inside and shot the men. A certain chic British
[00:42:13] diplomat, G. H. Fitz Morris wrote, ordered his followers to bring as many stalwart young
[00:42:21] Armenians as they could find to their number of about 100 they were thrown down on their backs
[00:42:26] and held down by their hands and feet while the shake with a combination of fanaticism, cruelty,
[00:42:34] proceeded while reciting verses of the Quran to cut their throats after the mecharite of
[00:42:42] sacrificing sheep. Those hiding were dragged out and butchered, stoned, shot and set on fire with
[00:42:53] madding saturated with petroleum. Women were cut down shielding their husbands and fathers,
[00:43:01] more Armenians were shot as they scampered along rooftops trying to escape when the killings
[00:43:06] subsided. The houses were looted and torched. As Sunset approached, the trumpet sounded again,
[00:43:15] calling the troops and the mob to withdraw. The atrocities resumed the following day December
[00:43:23] 29 with a trumpet sound that dawn. The largest number were killed at the Armenian Cathedral,
[00:43:29] where thousands had gathered for sanctuary. The attackers first fired through the windows into
[00:43:34] the church, then smashed in the doors and killed the men clustered on the ground floor.
[00:43:40] Fits Morris relates that as the mob plunged the church, they mockingly called on Christ to prove
[00:43:46] himself a greater profit than Mohamed. The Turks then shot the shrieking and terrified massive
[00:43:54] women children and some men in the second floor gallery. But gunning the Armenians down,
[00:44:00] one by one was too tedious, so the mob brought in more petroleum soaked bedding and set
[00:44:05] fired to the woodwork and the staircase is leading up to the galleries. For several hours,
[00:44:10] the sickening odor of roasting flesh pervaded the town.
[00:44:17] Writing the following march, Fits Morris noted, even today,
[00:44:23] the smell of the charred remains in the church is unbearable.
[00:44:26] The missionary who witnessed a massacre's described the horror as a grand holocaust,
[00:44:35] and for days afterwards watched men lugging sacks filled with bones and ashes from the cathedral.
[00:44:44] The trumpet again sounded at 330 pm the time for the Muslim afternoon prayer and the mob
[00:44:50] with Jew from the Armenian quarter. Shortly afterwards, Mert Fits Morris wrote,
[00:44:56] the muffti, Ali Effendi, who sang Pasha and other notables preceded by a band of musicians
[00:45:04] went around the quarter announcing that the massacre was at an end and that there would be no
[00:45:09] more killing of Christians. For the next three days, the authorities employed Jews and Donkeys
[00:45:18] to remove the dead before the massacre's erphra was home to about 20,000 Armenians.
[00:45:27] All told, perhaps as many as 10,000 died over the course of two days,
[00:45:33] 2500 to 3000 of them at the cathedral.
[00:45:36] This was no shock or moving into World War I.
[00:45:49] Although, there's maybe a way that nothing can prepare you for it, even if you've seen it
[00:45:57] come in when it happens. You're just not ready. There were a lot of Jews in Europe in the 1930s
[00:46:03] who were writing to their relatives and other parts of the world sang. We got to get out of here.
[00:46:08] We're sitting on the edge of a volcano right now. Who still, when it actually came,
[00:46:14] we're all just caught with that deer and a headlight look because what do you do?
[00:46:19] There's a lot of you can read a lot of stuff from Holocaust survivors, children, and also from
[00:46:25] Zionists who were in Palestine out of the country at the time who really can't understand why
[00:46:29] our parents or our cousins who were in Europe at the time, why aren't they fighting back? Why aren't
[00:46:34] they rising up or whatever? You just don't know what it's like to be caught.
[00:46:39] Where there's nowhere to go, the enemies in control, and there is, you can rush the electrified
[00:46:45] fence, you can, you're caught, and they've established dominance in a way that you're not going
[00:46:50] to really be able to get out of because again, these modern scale genocides like this are
[00:46:56] something that could really only be pulled off by a state. How the young Turks play into this?
[00:47:02] So after you know, there were people within the Turkish hierarchy who understood that this
[00:47:09] that this empire as it stands right now, it's got to change.
[00:47:13] Got to make a transition to have to.
[00:47:15] Let's learn it. If we're going to compete at any level with the British Empire, the rising
[00:47:20] Russian Empire, like we got to get it together, and the way we're running things now,
[00:47:24] or we can't even really control our territory effectively a few hundred miles out east,
[00:47:28] that's just not going to do it. It's not going to do it anymore.
[00:47:32] And so they were modernizers. This was a movement that started out in universities,
[00:47:36] a lot of medical students, lost students, things like that, and it was an underground group.
[00:47:40] It was sort of a revolutionary group, sort of like you were seeing all across Europe at the time,
[00:47:44] you know, the Bolsheviks and a lot of the socialists in Russia, for example.
[00:47:49] The difference I guess between like them and the Bolsheviks, there's a million differences,
[00:47:53] but the main one is they weren't international communist or anything. They were fierce,
[00:47:57] fierce Turkish nationalists. But they were, they were multi-cultural. This was a big difference, too.
[00:48:04] This wasn't strictly Armenians or Greeks inside of these were people saying,
[00:48:09] it's like when you hear today, you know, like I'm not a Irish American, I'm an American.
[00:48:14] Right. These people are saying, hey, I'm not an Armenian Turk, or I'm not a Jewish Turk. I'm Turk.
[00:48:19] Yeah. So they actually had, but they called the Ottomanist movement.
[00:48:23] You know, they were, they wanted everybody. This is a big thing in the late 1800s,
[00:48:27] really up until the defeat in the First World War that that everywhere were all Ottomans, right?
[00:48:34] Which at the time was like Ottoman, that's just the name of the Turkish commander who came in with
[00:48:39] that, you know, he was established their tribe. I mean, he was the tribal leader at the time,
[00:48:42] all S'mon. But, you know, by the time you got up to this point, I mean, America's
[00:48:47] some of the Italian sailors too, right? So like you can do that, no problem. But there was the ideas
[00:48:51] that we're all Ottomans here. Doesn't matter where you were born. Whatever. In fact, a lot of the
[00:48:55] young Turk and committee of Union and Progress, which was like a really militant group,
[00:49:00] subgroup of the young Turks. Some of their leaders, including some of the ones that would be in charge
[00:49:05] of the empire during the First World War, they weren't Turkish. Tullot Pasha of the guy was the
[00:49:10] interior minister and the effect of head of government for the Ottoman Empire was from Bulgaria, for
[00:49:16] example. In the young Turks, they had Jews, they had Armenians. The Armenians, in fact, really
[00:49:21] supported the young Turks at first because they thought we have this force that's maybe more
[00:49:26] trying to be modernizing influence seems like more of a secular influence because that was one
[00:49:32] other thing I didn't mention is as you as the Ottoman Empire started to get worried about these
[00:49:38] Christians to size European societies pushing up on their borders and maybe using their interior
[00:49:43] internal Christians as fifth columnists let's create some divide. They really started pushing
[00:49:48] that Islamic identity and really playing that angle of it up, which was something they kind of avoided
[00:49:52] before for the most part. Obviously, like the Ottoman Empire is the caliphate, right? The Sultan is the
[00:49:57] caliph. And so they're in charge, you're in somebody else's house, right? If you're a Christian
[00:50:02] or a Jew, this is the Muslims house and everybody knew that, but they really, they had an empire
[00:50:08] to manage. They weren't trying to create problems between their Muslim and Christian and Jewish subjects,
[00:50:13] by the time when it once they started worrying about the loyalty of these Christian subjects
[00:50:18] and worrying not only about that actually worrying about their non-Turkish imperial subjects,
[00:50:23] like they were worried about the Arabs not wanting to be under Turkish rule and as we saw in World War
[00:50:28] one that was probably a good call. They saw the British sent Lawrence of Arabia down there and got
[00:50:32] the Arabs to rise up and march on on the Ottoman Empire. And so they wanted to avoid
[00:50:37] that. And so they started playing up to the Arabs, it's your Muslims. This is a Muslim empire. How
[00:50:42] could you side with the British? They would say to the Kurds, you know, that you had the Russian
[00:50:47] empire who was trying to encourage Kurdish separatism, for example, just to kind of create some
[00:50:51] chaos and some problems over there. And they wanted them to say, hey, your Muslims, don't you see
[00:50:56] those Christians or just want to destroy this glorious Muslim empire? That's side effect of that,
[00:51:02] or maybe it wasn't a side effect. Because they were worried about their loyalty of these internal
[00:51:07] Christians as well, was that those Kurds? Yeah, we are Muslim. And these Christians are trying
[00:51:11] to destroy this glorious Muslim empire. Those Armenians are Christian and you started to get some
[00:51:17] real problems there. And when you couple that with what they were teaching in classrooms and stuff,
[00:51:21] by the time you get up to, you know, the first world war, it's at a fever pitch. Well,
[00:51:27] the young Turks, they seemed to be a force and to some degree they were a force that was trying to
[00:51:32] move the empire beyond all that. And so you have these Armenians, including like Armenian militant
[00:51:38] groups, you know, that it really formed up because they, because of the mistreatment of the Armenians
[00:51:43] in the East, who are down with the young Turks, the fully supported him in 1908 when the young Turks
[00:51:49] launch a coup to, you know, take over the government. They march on Constantinople, take over the
[00:51:53] government. Armenians were cheering in the streets. The Armenian militant groups were celebrating that.
[00:51:58] In 1909, a year later there was a counter coup by the conservative Sultan forces, the
[00:52:05] Sultan's forces. And during that brief period that the Sultan was back in power and the young
[00:52:10] Turks were out of power, another 30,000 Armenians got massacred in the province of Adana.
[00:52:15] And it was done with the same character that you just read. You know, this is a, again, this is
[00:52:21] the first world war in that whole period is, it's so fascinating, right? Because it's this war
[00:52:27] in which the old world marched into those trenches and the new world marched out of them,
[00:52:34] you know, it's the pre-modern world and then the modern world just really it's that transition point
[00:52:39] in that clash. And so you have this genocide that is done for modern reasons, like national
[00:52:44] reasons almost, right? You didn't, you know, this idea of like ethnic purity and needing to have
[00:52:50] like our internal period, that's a modernist idea. And the, the means by which it was carried out
[00:52:55] administratively and all of these things, the Turkish Empire was a modern empire many ways.
[00:53:00] But this is genocide that was not carried out, you know, with with ledger sheets and, you know,
[00:53:08] Zyklan B and, and gas ovens or anything like that. This was something that was done the old way.
[00:53:13] It was done with hatchets and axes and hand knives and kitchen knives and clubs and boots.
[00:53:21] And it was something that, you know, it was a genocide that was conducted in ravines just off the road
[00:53:29] and in people's basements, not on battlefields. So the situation that we're looking at,
[00:53:39] now now we get ready for World War One. And the, is it a Hillary Clinton quote,
[00:53:45] Never let a crisis go to waste. That was, that was Rama manual. Yeah, okay. President Obama's first
[00:53:51] chief of staff. Never let a crisis go to waste. Yeah. It's a new quote, but it's not a new idea at all.
[00:53:57] And so World War One breaks out. Yeah. And this is an opportunity. And they get started right away.
[00:54:04] And some people who may have been paying attention at the time, they may have had some idea that
[00:54:08] the young Turks had changed a little because they took the government back over pretty quickly in 1909.
[00:54:13] So the young Turks are in charge now. And a lot of the Armenians feel pretty good about that.
[00:54:18] At least relative to what they had been facing before. But in 1910,
[00:54:23] there was this incident. People were complaining about all of these stray dogs running around
[00:54:26] Constantinople. Tens of thousands of them that were just running around. They were attacking people
[00:54:31] sometimes destroying the city. And the young Turk government was called on to fix this problem.
[00:54:35] How are you going to fix it? Well, they sent dog catchers, thousands of dog catchers out. And they
[00:54:40] caught all of these dogs one by one. It's about 80,000 dogs they caught. And they put them in cages.
[00:54:47] And they took them all out to this island, right off the coast, in the Dardenells.
[00:54:51] And they just dropped them off there. And the medium size ones ate the small ones.
[00:54:56] The big ones ate the medium size ones. The mean ones ate the big ones. And then the mean ones
[00:55:01] died of starvation. And that's how they dealt with the dogs in Constantinople.
[00:55:06] The young Turks were this force that was supposed to be fixing all of these old legacy
[00:55:14] problems of the empire. Well, they had a chance to prove it in 1912 and 1913, just the year before
[00:55:19] the first World War Breaks out. You had the serves and the Montenegroans and a coalition of
[00:55:23] other small Balkan Slavic peoples up there who revolted against the empire. And the young Turks
[00:55:29] sent an army up there and they got pushed back. And the young Turks were humiliated by this.
[00:55:34] They lost the last of their European territories in the Balkans by doing that. And they blamed,
[00:55:41] very, and they very much blamed sort of fifth columnist Christians in those Balkan territories for
[00:55:46] what had happened. And right around this time, you start to see the forces within the young
[00:55:51] Turk movement that is very anti-Christian and specifically anti-Rominian. Because they're
[00:55:56] the ones that they really worry about. The Greeks are a separate issue. We'll talk about them a
[00:56:00] little bit. But you can say killed 300,000 Greeks right around this period too. They killed 300,000
[00:56:05] a Syrian Christians. They killed a couple hundred thousand Lebanese Christians. This was a, this was a
[00:56:10] mass killing of all Christians across the empire. They just really had it in for the Armenians in
[00:56:14] particular. And so the first World War Breaks out and, you know, again, I mentioned this like
[00:56:20] very near the beginning, you have the Armenians who recognize that like this could be a problem.
[00:56:24] Like this is going to be an issue for us not necessarily that they're going to do something
[00:56:28] like genocide us because nobody was thinking like that at the time. You know, you have to remember
[00:56:32] like nobody had, this was a pre-Holokos, this was pre-Polpot, this is pre-stalin or any of that kind
[00:56:38] of stuff. Like the idea that you would have one of these major empires. And the Ottoman Empire
[00:56:43] like to us maybe, you know, we think of it as like this very sort of exotic foreign empire that's
[00:56:49] almost this, this throwback from like an ancient time or something like that and very orient.
[00:56:54] I mean, this was the Europeans, you know, they had, they were fully integrated with,
[00:56:59] with Europe for the most part. I mean, this was something that people read about,
[00:57:03] Constantinople in the New York Times every day. You know, this was, people talk about like,
[00:57:07] you know, Germany, how one of the crazy things about the Holocaust is like,
[00:57:11] but it's Germany, how could Germany do something like that? You know, this is,
[00:57:15] we're leaving it's came from, it's way to, and a girth that came from. And, you know, the Turks were
[00:57:20] not as foreign, the Ottoman Empire rather was not as foreign back then as we probably
[00:57:25] tend to otherwise it and think about it today. And so nobody was thinking like they're going to
[00:57:29] wipe us all out. Yeah, there might be massacres that local populations might get out of control
[00:57:34] on the local government there might encourage them or or not stop them from doing it. But nobody
[00:57:39] was quite thinking along such totalizing lines because they just didn't have a historical
[00:57:44] precedent for it. Yeah, the, um, that idea that you talked about earlier of sitting there thinking,
[00:57:50] well, you know, this isn't going to happen. Right. How can this happen? Well, even as it was happening,
[00:57:56] even as it was happening and it was definitely happening. Let's hear a little bit about what happened,
[00:58:02] going back to the book. During the first days falling my arrival in Constantinople,
[00:58:11] I hastened to call on several notables who might had known for a long time and who were friends
[00:58:15] of mine. My general impression was this, no one grasped the gravity of the situation and no one
[00:58:21] was worried about tomorrow. Many insisted that Turkey would not enter the war when it began. They
[00:58:27] said the mobilization was simply a precaution. They were simple minded people convinced that as
[00:58:32] long as the government was in the hands of the young Turks. And Talaat was the interior minister,
[00:58:40] no danger faced them. But alas, the Armenian leaders came to understand the truth,
[00:58:49] only when they were already walking on the road to death. So deceived where they by the
[00:58:57] flattery of promises lavished upon them that would achieve a police and several policemen came to
[00:59:03] find Anaguni, one of the dashnack party leaders and a brilliant Russian Armenian writer and placed
[00:59:11] him under arrest. The superfied Anaguni, am I saying that right? Anaguni, Agnuni,
[00:59:18] asked if Talaat knew about this. And when the police chief showed him the arrest warrant,
[00:59:24] be bearing Talaat's signature, Agnuni was even more stunned and replied that he had been at Talaat's
[00:59:30] for dinner a short while before. And wanted to know why Talaat hadn't said anything about it.
[00:59:39] The unfortunate Anaguni being an idealistic and honorable man could not comprehend how Talaat
[00:59:45] could plot against him so cynically. The same Talaat whom he had sheltered in order to save Talaat's
[00:59:51] life while risking his own during the counterrevolution following March 31, 1909, along with his
[00:59:58] five comrades, Agnuni was taken from Idaesh. About four fifths of the way he realized that he was
[01:00:07] going to be murdered. And when Vahak, the well-known leader of the dashnacks was warned by his friends
[01:00:16] in Adana. He answered calmly and with deep conviction. As long as Jamal Pasha, who's the official
[01:00:25] intrargetarian Palestine, is alive, no one can touch a hair on my head. Then pointing to a large portrait
[01:00:33] of Jamal Pasha in a guilt-frain, prominently displayed in his room, he said, long live my good friend
[01:00:40] and friend of the Armenians. Jamal Pasha. I recall in detail the circumstances of Vahak's hanging
[01:00:48] ordered by Jamal Pasha. So here you have these people who are, they're looking, you know, it's like,
[01:00:58] hey, well, that guy's a friend of mine. He's not going to do this to me. One of them, you know,
[01:01:02] one of them talking about Talaat. I already took care of Talaat. He's going to take care of me.
[01:01:09] Or, you know, I, Jamal Pasha, he's a friend of mine.
[01:01:11] You know, there's a, from another book that you mentioned earlier,
[01:01:22] they have another interesting thing. You know, this is around the time when we start cat read
[01:01:27] and we have documents, documents that explain what, what orders were being given. And there's
[01:01:33] speaking of Talaat who is overall in charge of the government and the architect of the genocide,
[01:01:39] one of the documents, there's like a reluctant regional governor who was kind of kind of playing
[01:01:48] dumb. Hey, I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do. Is this really what you want? And Talaat sent
[01:01:52] a three word telegram that said, Yack, for old year, that's it. And those, those words mean burn,
[01:02:07] demolish, kill. No room for confusion there. No room for confusion there. And that's how we,
[01:02:17] that's how we start moving into this, this situation just disintegrates now. Yeah. So if you look
[01:02:26] at why the Ottoman Empire was brought into the war by the Germans, what did the Ottoman Empire
[01:02:33] get out of it? What did the Germans expect to get out of it? What the Germans expected to get out of it
[01:02:37] was look, they're facing the British, the French, and the Russians. All three of them have been
[01:02:42] taking away territory from the Ottoman Empire for years. The Ottoman Empire would like to take
[01:02:46] that territory back, and these other three would like to keep it. So if the Ottoman Empire doesn't
[01:02:50] have to help us conquer the world here or anything, if they can just put some pressure on Egypt,
[01:02:54] put some pressure on the Caucasus and on the Balkans, then these other three empires that the
[01:03:00] Germans are facing are going to have to like redirect some resources to defend them. That's the idea.
[01:03:05] And for the Ottoman Empire, they thought this is an opportunity to get some territory back
[01:03:09] and also to fortify our position internally so that when this war is over, we don't have
[01:03:17] any problems inside that can be exploited again later. And the Ottoman Empire was not,
[01:03:27] look, the Turks can fight, they can still fight to this day from what I understand. I mean,
[01:03:30] there are a warrior people and they carry that in them, but they were not prepared for this war.
[01:03:34] They weren't prepared to go toe to toe with the British Empire.
[01:03:37] And with the Russian Empire. And so the first thing that happens, you mentioned Talat Pasha,
[01:03:44] and you mentioned Jamal Pasha. Those were two out of the three people who were kind of the Ottoman
[01:03:49] triumvirate during the first World War. Talat was the interior minister and he was the head of government
[01:03:54] for all effective purposes. Jamal Pasha was the head of the navy and he was the military governor of
[01:04:00] Syria, which is a much bigger territory than we're talking about today. It was really like all
[01:04:04] of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, like that whole thing. And he was known by the Arabs in Damascus,
[01:04:10] by the way, as the butcher, he was he starved to death very similar to the way Stalin did the holiday
[01:04:17] more. He starved to death a few hundred thousand Lebanese Christians in Mount Lebanon where
[01:04:24] he was taking all of food sending it out to the front, not allowing any food aid or anything else
[01:04:31] to come in. And a few hundred thousand people just starved to death on the streets. There are accounts
[01:04:36] from people who are there like American University and other Western missionaries in diplomats who say
[01:04:42] they would put cotton balls in their ears in their houses because outside it was just moaning children,
[01:04:48] moaning women, people dying on the streets begging for food. It just sounded like the zombie
[01:04:53] apocalypse out there. Just moans, day and night, people dying. You go out in the morning and open
[01:04:58] up your door and there's a dead child on your doorstep. I mean, Mount Lebanon lost 50% of its population
[01:05:05] up there. It was one of the worst hit parts of the entire country. And so those are two of the guys.
[01:05:09] And the third one, remember that Triumph, where it is in Ver paasha, and paasha is just a term of
[01:05:14] respect in the Ottoman Empire. It's a very high ranking, like official basically. It's not there.
[01:05:19] They're not brothers or anything. And so in Ver decides, you know, Napoleon tried to invade Russia
[01:05:26] in the winter. Hitler's going to try and do it in a few decades. Not going to go well for either
[01:05:30] of those guys, but screw it. Let's go for it. And so he gets his force and he tries to go up into
[01:05:35] the caucuses and face the Russian army up there. Maybe feeling like he's going to catch them off guard.
[01:05:39] He doesn't. The battle of Sarah Comash happens and the Russians wiping out and pushing him way back.
[01:05:45] And so now the Ottoman Empire is really starting to panic, right? If you look at like when the
[01:05:49] Holocaust really kicked into gear, it wasn't 1939, it wasn't 1940, it wasn't even really in early 1941.
[01:05:58] It was after the Germans got within seven miles of Moscow and then those Siberian troops showed up
[01:06:03] and pushed the Germans back and they realized this might not work out the way we thought it was going to.
[01:06:08] And they said, well, what else can we accomplish then? What else can we accomplish? And
[01:06:15] because the caucus is over there. If you look at the territory, Eastern Turkey,
[01:06:19] you know, the Armenians in Southeast or Eastern Turkey, they're right across the border as more
[01:06:24] Armenians. That's modern Armenia, right across the border today. And so, and these people didn't,
[01:06:28] you know, they were separate, don't keep you wrong. They even spoke really different dialects,
[01:06:32] you know, two large-degree and stuff, but they still knew that those were their Armenian cousins
[01:06:35] over the border and they knew it back and forth. Kind of like the curbs in southern Turkey in northern
[01:06:39] Syria today. And so when the Russian army pushes past, it passed that border into Eastern Turkey,
[01:06:47] the Ottoman Empire, thinking with some, just as I was some reason that these people who they
[01:06:55] had just massacred, a few hundred thousand of a few decades back and have been allowing to be abused
[01:07:00] by the Kurds and everybody else who wants a peace in the decades since, that the Russians are going
[01:07:05] to mobilize these people and put them to work against the Ottoman Empire. And so, as the Turks are
[01:07:09] retreating, they are just slaughtering and burning and destroying everything they can. Just terrorizing
[01:07:16] Armenians, murdering the people they see, especially military-age men. Most of the military-age
[01:07:21] men, by this point, have either been conscripted into the military and then disarmed, put into a
[01:07:30] slave labor battalion. And by the time you get up to 1915 around the battle of the Lippoli,
[01:07:35] they'll be worked to death or simply murdered. Generally speaking, they would get these men who
[01:07:41] the Armenians who showed up for the draft and tell them, you're going to go into the interior,
[01:07:46] we're going to build trenches, defensive fortifications, and they'd all go and they'd spend all
[01:07:50] they'd digging a trench and they'd be like, great job. Can you stand on the edge of it, please?
[01:07:54] And then they would murder them all and then fill the trench in. It was a mass grave, they'd been
[01:07:58] digging for themselves the entire time. And so, as this is going on, you have the other Armenian
[01:08:04] young man, military-age men who were like, well, they either saw that coming or maybe they
[01:08:12] didn't want to leave their home villages because they were already getting attacked by Kurdish
[01:08:15] tribes every other day and they said, I can't leave my wife and kids here and my parents here.
[01:08:19] And so, they just refused to go. But that meant you had to go into hiding, you had to go somewhere
[01:08:23] because the Turks found you as a rap. And so, all of these villages that the retreating
[01:08:28] Ottoman army is coming back through and just murdering and terrorizing, these are pretty much
[01:08:33] all women-children-old people. And that's going to be a theme throughout the entire story.
[01:08:38] Is the men are already gone? The men have already been killed a long time ago or they've had to
[01:08:43] run away across the Russian, you know, across the Russian battle lines. A lot of them did go join
[01:08:50] the Russian forces once the genocide kicked in. And so, a lot of the stuff that we're going to be
[01:08:56] that we're going to be hearing about going forward, this is all stuff that's being done pretty
[01:08:59] much entirely to groups of women-children and old people by military fighters. And so, that's
[01:09:07] that first step, disarming and then killing the Armenian men who had joined the military happens.
[01:09:13] And the second thing that the Ottoman Empire needs to do, this is before the real genocide,
[01:09:17] the mass deportations and killing really start in a systematic way. You know, they have to
[01:09:21] lay the groundwork for it and after disarming the Armenian military people, they decided they
[01:09:27] needed to get rid of these two towns that they expected would put up resistance because they had
[01:09:32] done so before. They did so during the Hamidian masquerers in the 1890s. In fact, one of them, Zetun,
[01:09:38] which was a, you know, these are mountain men. You know, these are tough people that even
[01:09:42] other Armenians kind of looked at them like they were a little bit crude and uncivilized.
[01:09:47] They were like, uh, Appalachian scotch Irish kind of like the way we in America look at
[01:09:52] those Appalachian folks like man, they're wild and they're kind of crazy and whatever, but
[01:09:55] boy, like, uh, you start problems with them, then you're going to have some problems yourself. Like,
[01:10:00] they're not going to, you're very independent minded and not used to or down with being told
[01:10:06] what to do by people. And Zetun was up in the up in the hills and they knew that they were not going
[01:10:13] to just accept this and they had the capacity to actually push back a little bit. So they
[01:10:17] they started the maskilling across Anatolia at the time. They might have to worry about these
[01:10:22] two places either turning into fortresses where Armenians could retreat and then from there who knows
[01:10:27] or just that they could turn out enough partisan fighters. They could really create problems
[01:10:31] in, uh, in the re-reational one. And so they go there first and they just, um,
[01:10:37] they wiped those places out. They go to van, Vaughan is the second one besides Zetun.
[01:10:42] And, um, you know, they go in and, uh, give them an ultimatum, tell all your men to come out.
[01:10:47] Uh, they do this under the under the guise of like we're looking for draft Dodgers and
[01:10:51] deserters and so forth. And so they show up and they just round up anybody who's there who's
[01:10:56] important, right? Any of the older men who are leaders, if there's any writers or singers or poets,
[01:11:02] if there's anybody who's prominent who could serve in a leadership capacity, you know,
[01:11:07] a sort of a collecting point for people, a rallying point. They take all them, they torture them,
[01:11:12] and they kill a bunch of them. And then they give the rest of the people an opportunity to
[01:11:17] turn in any of the men who are still around or anything. And instead the people in van barricade themselves
[01:11:22] into the town and say, we're not coming out, give us back our, our notables, give us back our, our men,
[01:11:27] our leaders. And so, uh, instead they roll in artillery and they just start shelling the town
[01:11:33] and, um, intermittently they'll send in Muslim mobs to go in and massacre the people who were in there.
[01:11:39] And eventually, uh, they, they kill enough people that they're able to get all the women and
[01:11:44] children out and they send them marching south into the desert. They do something very similar and
[01:11:48] they tune as well. Surrounded with artillery, um, burned down the monastery where a bunch of the
[01:11:54] younger men were hiding. And then the women and children who were left there, thousands and thousands,
[01:11:59] 20,000 or so and they tune actually. Um, actually, so yeah, actually, I left out one other
[01:12:06] thing. This is another thing that they, that they did to compel people is when the people in van
[01:12:11] were holed up and refusing to come out. They said, okay, Roger that and they just started going
[01:12:15] to all the villages around the town and just maskering all the people there. And, um, once they
[01:12:21] had pacified the area, they got all the women, children, uh, and old people who were left and they
[01:12:26] put them into care of ants under guard and they sent them marching south into the desert. And,
[01:12:31] you know, this is northern northern Syria, southern Turkey. That's what we're talking about here.
[01:12:35] So, you have, like, a lepo and was solo over in a rack that whole area. They just sent them
[01:12:39] marching south. Um, and then step three came. And this was really the thing that kicked off
[01:12:46] the program. Now that all of the men with guns have been neutralized, guys in the military,
[01:12:51] now that these two potential trouble sides of an and they tune or taking care of,
[01:12:55] they wanted to make sure that all of the Armenian national level leaders were neutralized. And so
[01:13:00] all of these men who are in Constantinople and Smyrna and some of the other big cities,
[01:13:04] including Gregorius Balakion, the priest who's book we're reading today,
[01:13:08] we're all arrested and deported down south as well. And, um, they could tell from the beginning that,
[01:13:17] uh, this was something probably a little bit different than what they had seen before.
[01:13:24] Well, speaking on the book, let's get a little, um, I witnessed a count going back to the book.
[01:13:30] On the night of Saturday, April 24th, 1915, the Armenians of the capital city exhausted from
[01:13:38] the Easter celebrations that had come to an end a few days earlier, we're snoring in a calm sleep.
[01:13:46] Meanwhile, on the heights of Stambul, a highly secret activity was taking place in the
[01:13:50] palatial central police station. Groups of Armenians had just been arrested in the suburbs
[01:13:56] and neighborhoods of the capital, blood-colored military buses were now transporting them to central
[01:14:02] prison. Weeks earlier, the Constantinople chief of police had sent official sealed orders to all
[01:14:08] guard houses with the instruction that they not be open until the designated day, and that they be carried
[01:14:14] out with precision and encequercy. On this Saturday night, I, along with eight friends, were
[01:14:24] transported by a small steamboat. The night smelled of death. The sea was rough, and our hearts
[01:14:32] were filled with terror. We prisoners were under strict police guard, not allowed to speak to one another.
[01:14:40] We had no idea where we were going. We arrived at the central prison and here, behind gigantic
[01:14:45] walls and large-boated gates, they put us in a wooden pavilion in the courtyard, which was said
[01:14:51] by some to have once served as a school. We sat there quiet and somber on a bare wooden floor
[01:14:56] under the faint light of a flickering lantern, two stunned and confused to make sense of what was happening.
[01:15:03] From the deep silence of the night until morning, every few hours, Armenians were brought to
[01:15:09] the prison. And so behind these high walls, the jostling and commotion increased as the crowd of
[01:15:16] prisoners became denser. It was as if all the prominent Armenian public figures, assemblymen,
[01:15:24] representatives, revolutionaries, editors, teachers, doctors, pharmacists, dentists, merchants,
[01:15:29] bankers, and others in the capital city had made an appointment to meet in these dim prison cells.
[01:15:37] Some even appeared in nightclothes and slippers. The more those familiar faces kept appearing,
[01:15:45] the more the chatter abated and our anxiety grew.
[01:15:51] Before long, everyone looks solemn, our hearts heavy and full of worry about the and impending storm.
[01:16:00] Not one of us understood why we had been arrested and no one could assess the consequences,
[01:16:05] as the nights hours slipped by are distressed mounted.
[01:16:09] Except for a few rare stoics, we were in a state of spiritual anguish, terrified of the unknown,
[01:16:15] and longing for comfort. Right through till morning, new Armenian prisoners arrived in each time
[01:16:23] we heard the roar of the military cars. We heard to the windows to see who they were.
[01:16:28] The new arrivals had contemptuous smiles on their faces, but when they saw hundreds of
[01:16:33] other well-known Armenians old and young around them, they too sank into fear.
[01:16:38] We were all searching for answers, asking what all of this meant, and pondering our fate.
[01:16:52] So these are all of the most famous Armenians in the country. These are the prominent priests,
[01:16:58] the writers in the big cities. These are the people who everybody in our, and everybody,
[01:17:03] every Armenian in Turkey knew who these people were. They knew them by name for the most part.
[01:17:08] And so they wanted to take them out immediately and just get them out of circulation at first.
[01:17:16] And they did it secretly. They did it quietly on April 24th, 1915,
[01:17:20] which is Armenian genocide remembrance day, because this is where it really kicks off.
[01:17:23] Once they did that, all most of the pieces were in place to begin the campaign of mass killing.
[01:17:31] The only things that remain were, there was this organization called the special organization.
[01:17:38] There had actually been set up for a previous war with the Russians,
[01:17:42] but they used it for a different purpose and augmented it with different people here.
[01:17:47] They freed about some 10-15,000 violent convicts from prisons, including thousands of murderers and rapists.
[01:17:55] And they freed them and promised them a pardon if they would ride with this group called the special
[01:18:00] organization, which was put under the command of the most fanatical anti-Armenian young Turks.
[01:18:06] And their job was to terrorize the Armenian population in an unrestrained manner.
[01:18:17] We think about genocide again, we're very influenced by the Holocaust and the way we think about these things.
[01:18:24] We think about a cool, exact discipline.
[01:18:26] And systematic, it's like, okay, what's your number?
[01:18:30] You can check that one off.
[01:18:31] And that's not how this was carried out.
[01:18:36] And this special organization is a good illustration of how that is.
[01:18:40] I mean, most genocides, when you look at millions of people dying in the Civil War and the Congo or in Sudan,
[01:18:47] you say, well, how's that happening? They don't have gas chambers there.
[01:18:51] They're not even going around and individually shooting every person that's there.
[01:18:55] You don't have to do that. All you have to do is go to one village.
[01:19:00] Not just kill them, but do it in the most horrific ways you can possibly imagine and make sure
[01:19:05] that a few people get away to go warn the next village over.
[01:19:08] And then those people who are mostly women, children and old people, because the men are all fighting
[01:19:12] or, you know, you can't be there when the army shows up, when the militia shows up,
[01:19:17] they say, we got to get out of here. So they take their kids and their grandparents and they run off into the bush.
[01:19:21] And defenseless women, children and old people die very quickly in the bush,
[01:19:26] while they die very quickly in the desert too. And so this was part of the goal.
[01:19:30] It's to go out there and terrorize brutally and make sure that word of that spreads to the other
[01:19:36] groups of these people get moving. Because if we can do that, they'll finish themselves off.
[01:19:42] We won't have to go around. Most of the, most of the Ottoman soldiers, they're off at the front.
[01:19:47] You know, this is being carried out by older John Don, police soldiers, ordinary men, type people,
[01:19:54] right? Like guys like that, as well as by local villagers and Kurdish tribes that they couldn't
[01:19:59] a conscripted if they wanted to. And it was helped along by the level of just savagery that they would
[01:20:05] perform these massacres in. And finally, the once everything else was in place,
[01:20:13] and this kind of happened systematically, I guess, over the, over the period of time that the
[01:20:18] genocide was taking place, but the central government worked to identify governors and mayors of
[01:20:23] local areas that might be reluctant to do what they needed to do. And when they were identified,
[01:20:29] they were taken out. Some of them were going in jail and some of them were even killed.
[01:20:33] But a lot of them were just reassigned to other places. One of them you started off talking about
[01:20:37] with a quote about what happened in Ankara. And that was an example, actually. That was one where
[01:20:41] the guy who, the valley, the governor of, of that province, he was trying to almost be a
[01:20:47] Oscar Schindler type. He got together a bunch of prominent Turks in the area, had them
[01:20:52] right a letter and sign a letter that he sent back to Constantinople saying, hey, look,
[01:20:56] whatever's going anywhere else. Like, our Armenians are actually cool. Like, we know them. They're
[01:20:59] not a problem. They're loyal. And so that guy was just fired and sent off to some random spot in
[01:21:05] the Empire. And his successor came in and immediately went to work, searched all the Armenian homes
[01:21:14] for weapons. Took them all the way right down to all their kitchen knives. The local jails there were
[01:21:20] emptied all the convicts were turned into paramilitaries. And once everything was in place, they got to work.
[01:21:28] You know, you think about that. If you were going to write like a freaking psycho,
[01:21:38] dystopic movie, right, what are you going to do? You're going to take the local criminals,
[01:21:45] rapists, murderers, and you're going to empower them and give them a authority.
[01:21:50] And total license. And in fact, encourage them to be as brutal as possible because
[01:21:56] that's part of the plan, you know, to drive these people out into the desert through brutality.
[01:22:03] It ends up looking like this going back to the book. The prominent prisoners, lawyers,
[01:22:08] bankers, merchants, and Armenian government officials were taken out on the road in the first
[01:22:14] care of an under the supervision of the police commissioner. The prison warden police soldiers and
[01:22:20] officers. Overall, superintendents was assigned to Shem Sedan, the son of Tobib, a member of the
[01:22:27] Ottoman parliament from Ankara. Although those in the Caravan were the distinguished people of the
[01:22:34] city, a mark was put on their arms and their feces, shoes, and coats were taken from them
[01:22:41] before they left the prison. Then these 150 sew or sew were taken out to the foot of town
[01:22:48] and tied together with a rope. The tools that would be used to kill these Armenians,
[01:22:57] axes, clevers, paddles, large knives, and other weapons were transported in four or five
[01:23:03] carriages directly behind the Caravan and following them were carriages filled with lime.
[01:23:09] To make sure that the crying and screaming of the people in this caravan would not be heard,
[01:23:18] some of the soldiers were ordered to play trumpets and drums as they left Ankara via the town's
[01:23:24] famous Toshcon section. Seven hours from the town, this dust-covered caravan reached the forest.
[01:23:33] They were met by the special organization. The freed criminals used as anti-Armenian death
[01:23:45] squads who possessed all kinds of weapons, a well-known lawyer. Armunog pleaded with the chief
[01:23:52] of the bandit group to be given as the sacred last right of one condemned to death,
[01:23:58] permission to say a few words. He received permission. Then he said with unusual cold
[01:24:05] hardness and a cavalier indifference to death that surprised even the special organization.
[01:24:12] It is no longer a secret that you have brought us here to be killed.
[01:24:18] But I want to ask you if you know why you are going to kill us.
[01:24:20] Leader of the bandit's answer that he didn't know why. Armunog continued. You should know
[01:24:29] that the high-ranking officials and the committee who gave you the orders to kill us did so
[01:24:34] solely to secure their personal gain and that they are leaving a stain on your history and laying
[01:24:40] waste to the fatherland. Barely had he spoke these prophetic words when hundreds of this
[01:24:53] special organization sheets attached from all sides, cutting and hacking off legs and arms and
[01:25:00] necks with axes and hatchets ripping them off partly or entirely and crushing heads with rocks.
[01:25:11] The bodies were thrown half alive dead or in the throws of death to be prepared ditches into
[01:25:17] prepared ditches and covered with lime. Those who were partly sticking out of the dirt and the lime
[01:25:25] made the heavenly arches resound with their cries of agony. More dirt was poured on them until they
[01:25:32] were buried alive. When the massacre of the first caravan was finished, the second caravan of
[01:25:43] more than 320 people was sent forward. Transported to the park known as Kayaesh, six hours from
[01:25:52] town, these people were massacred in the same merciless manner. The dismembered bodies of the
[01:26:00] martyrs were left unbehried for 15 days, Turkish officers then oversaw their burial by our
[01:26:06] minion labor soldiers. After massacring all these people, the special organization came back to
[01:26:15] town, wearing clothes, shoes and other items they had taken from them. Everywhere they boasted
[01:26:25] about how many Armenians they had killed and how in unheard of ways they had tortured and
[01:26:30] dismembered those who were still alive and even mutilated corpses. Similar massacres
[01:26:40] took place in other towns and villages with particular curr-cruity in Yazgat.
[01:26:49] First all the Armenian males of the town or city and then the women and girls were bound
[01:26:54] together and taken on foot to deep valleys a few hours away, accompanied by a Turkish mob
[01:27:01] armed with access. There they were slaughtered like sheep, pregnant women and suckling babes included.
[01:27:22] And that's how it went. Over and over and over and over and over. It's one of the things about genocide
[01:27:29] is you ever watch a movie about one or read a decent book written about a genocide they'll usually
[01:27:36] find some dramatic persona to focus on so that they have some kind of drama with it some story
[01:27:42] liner arc to follow because when you get down to it what it comes down to is we went to this village.
[01:27:48] We killed all the men. We raped all the women. We robbed all their stuff. Took their children
[01:27:51] his slaves and then we laughed and then we went to the next village and we raped all the women.
[01:27:57] We killed all the men. We took the children his slaves robbed all their stuff and we left and it's that
[01:28:01] 100 times a thousand times. You know you can't tell a Holocaust story or a right a Holocaust book
[01:28:10] that's just they marched 10,000 people to the edge of the mass graves. They shot him naked and they
[01:28:16] threw him in and they took these. It's just it gets repetitive in the most
[01:28:19] grotesque way imaginable and that's what a genocide is. The depravity of it is easy to focus on but in many ways
[01:28:29] the especially after it's been going on for months or years and the people themselves the killers
[01:28:36] themselves have been almost brutalized psychologically and spiritually by what they're doing and it
[01:28:41] becomes routine for them so that things that some individuals may have hesitated to do it first or not
[01:28:48] things that elicit any kind of hesitation anymore that it just becomes this grind of death.
[01:28:57] And one of the things that makes the Armenian genocide a thing that is I guess you could maybe
[01:29:06] only compare it to what happened in Rwanda in so far as the extent to which the general population
[01:29:14] was mobilized to participate. Something like again like with the Germans. This was something
[01:29:22] you know, Ernst Younger during the Second World War was stationed in Paris. He was sort of a cultural
[01:29:27] figure that I that point so he was kind of there as like a technically was some kind of a minister
[01:29:31] of this or that I can't remember but really was there as like a cultural figure and he was in Paris
[01:29:37] 1942, you know 1941 and he's writing letters to people trying to figure out like I keep hearing about
[01:29:43] all these things that are going on out and polling down the east like what's going on out in the
[01:29:46] east like I hear about bad things going on east. This is Ernst Younger. I mean this is a guy that
[01:29:50] even the Nazis like thought this guy was great you know there was there was possibility that he was
[01:29:57] in on one of the failed assassination attempts. Maybe he knew about it at least but Hitler himself
[01:30:03] even said nobody touches Ernst Younger. This is the guy. This is the guy that wrote Stormusty.
[01:30:07] I forget which podcast we covered up that on but I mean this guy is a hero to the German people.
[01:30:13] Yeah and so even him a guy in that position serving as a minister in Paris at the time he's like
[01:30:20] trying to find out what's going on in the east because the way that that was conducted and you know
[01:30:24] it gets overplayed a little bit how secret it was and everything. It did take a large number of
[01:30:29] people including the vermark to pull off some of it but relatively speaking this was something that was
[01:30:34] able to be kept from the German people and to be localized to the SS and like you know the people
[01:30:40] who were actually handling it. Yeah and it's one thing to you know the okay so the German
[01:30:47] populists is let's say they're helping round-up Jews but that's what they think they're doing
[01:30:52] is rounding up the Jews or they're going to ship them off they're going to be slave labor they don't
[01:30:55] they many cases didn't know the end state right whereas here we have the the Turkish population at
[01:31:03] large doing the tactical operation of genocide. Yes and you know there's a quote from a great book
[01:31:13] I know I've brought it up a few times another podcast that by Philip Garevich about the Roman
[01:31:18] in genocide we was to inform you that tomorrow we killed with our families and he has a quote in
[01:31:22] there when he's talking about what genocide is and the two the society that's perpetrating it and
[01:31:29] he has this line that's always stuck with me says genocide after all is a sort of community building
[01:31:34] exercise and that stuck with me as I was reading all the material about the Armenian genocide in
[01:31:41] the way that it's specific way that it was handled one of the things that happened was these people
[01:31:47] who would be deported down south when I say that what I'm talking about is you know all the men
[01:31:52] would be killed and the women children and old people who were left would be put into a caravan
[01:31:56] they'd be sent down to march in the Syrian desert on a march that would take about two months
[01:32:01] and when they got to the end it was just there was a death camp there where they would anybody
[01:32:05] who survived two months with you know no food because it would all be taken from them right away
[01:32:11] you know if they couldn't scrounge bugs out of the desert or eat dead bodies or whatever they
[01:32:15] had to do they'd buy a starvation if they couldn't if you weren't a woman who could
[01:32:19] you know use your body or whatever to get a Turkish soldier to give you a drink of water or do
[01:32:27] whatever you had to do then you died on the way and the roads were littered with bodies and sometimes
[01:32:31] they would just massacre all of you along the way but the ones who got to the end would get to these
[01:32:35] death camps in the Syrian desert and these routes you know it doesn't take two months to walk
[01:32:43] directly in a straight line from one place to their end state and an end place in the Syrian desert
[01:32:47] they would go on these winding routes sometimes and it wasn't just to drag it out so that people
[01:32:54] would die of exposure and starvation they would actually bring them through different
[01:32:58] Muslim villages different territories of Kurdish and Circassian tribes and when they would come
[01:33:05] through a given area just like we saw here people would be waiting for them with weapons
[01:33:10] and they would attack and they would rape and they would take the women that they liked away
[01:33:15] as sex slaves they would take the children away as slaves they would rob them of what they could but
[01:33:21] it was only allowed for a certain period of time and very often the Turkish soldiers this is actually
[01:33:26] what would happen much of the time is they would sort of organize it a little bit really like well
[01:33:30] here's a really really pretty Armenian all of you want her as a sex slave well let's hold an
[01:33:35] auction and then the Turkish soldiers get paid oh well you know we're gonna get a lot of the most
[01:33:39] valuable things that they have and so the Turkish soldiers were getting paid it was a way of
[01:33:45] sort of it was a very crude and brutal form of wealth redistribution in a way everything that these
[01:33:50] Armenians had they were being walked around to these different villages and territories so that
[01:33:55] each of the people in those places got their cut and there would be almost you read accounts where
[01:34:02] it's almost like there's a sense of expectancy almost like a party atmosphere when people know
[01:34:07] another care of ants coming through what are we gonna get this time and um all of these these
[01:34:14] Kurdish tribes a lot of these Islamic villages there were Armenian women and children
[01:34:22] tons of them in a lot of these places a lot of them would just be taken sometimes it slaves
[01:34:26] and when the novelty wore off after a few weeks or a few months they would just be murdered or turned
[01:34:30] turned away out in the desert to go to go wander and die um that then the other thing that's
[01:34:36] happening when they're doing that is that the state is taking well they're taking the opposite
[01:34:41] approach that the the Nazis took right which is that they are making all of these people
[01:34:48] complicit in this atrocity that the state is carrying out and it really does bind them together in
[01:34:53] the same kind of way that you know you know like in a mafia movie where you do a hit and all three of us
[01:34:59] who did it have to fire a shot to the body because we're all in this together now and it's uh
[01:35:05] you know this this shared knowledge that we have all participated in this tremendous crime
[01:35:12] that even going forward that can bind people together in a certain way especially we've all benefited
[01:35:16] from it we've taken slaves from it we've we've robbed and maybe the things in our house right now
[01:35:22] the furniture in our house right now maybe uh we're things that we that we took from these people when we
[01:35:28] killed them and um that's how it went over and over and over and over again you know and the
[01:35:36] thing that always the thing that is just the most unbearable to me is imagining like just I've
[01:35:43] mentioned it a few times already but it's the it's always the thing I can't get out of my head about this
[01:35:46] is that these are all women children old people the men were gone already and just imagining like
[01:35:51] your mother or your wife or your sisters or your kids being marched along out to the desert but
[01:35:59] these people set up on you know not blown up by a predator drone as bad as that it is they are being
[01:36:06] hacked down with machetes and axes and as you saw like in one of the one I think the
[01:36:12] onker eggs and apple that you read in in massacres that would take hours and hours and hours
[01:36:18] you know it takes a long time some of these they're killing 6, 7, 8,000 people at a time in a ravine
[01:36:22] by hand and that takes time and so it's just screaming in the smell of feces and blood and people
[01:36:33] you know you have just body parts hacked up over here and over there there's just a big rape or
[01:36:38] G and it's all right next to each other while over here they're searching your mother's pockets
[01:36:43] for any gold coin she might have and it's and it's that first far as you can see there are times
[01:36:49] where they did you know one instance where they did 6400 people was was the consensus estimate on it
[01:36:55] and it was the entire ravine I mean you come over this ridge and it's just this entire ravine
[01:37:00] hundreds of yards and it is just bodies and they're not dead of you know this this place was
[01:37:07] was witnessed by an American from somebody from the American consulate who wrote out and saw it
[01:37:12] afterwards these bodies are not people who died of starvation or thirst or exposure these are people
[01:37:18] who's are just one big mass of gashes and mutilation and hacked off limbs and women with their
[01:37:25] heads cut off who are laying there with their dresses thrown up over their head and their legs spread
[01:37:31] with their heads cut off I mean that this is the these are the scenes that you see over and over and
[01:37:35] over and over to the point where you know you read a book like the 30 year genocide about it where
[01:37:40] he really does take the time to get into each of the massacres and it becomes almost significantly
[01:37:46] nauseatingly boring in a way and it's just it's hard to imagine when you make it personal like that
[01:37:55] you know trying to imagine the helplessness that you would feel knowing that this had happened
[01:38:02] to people that you cared about or being one of those people it would just it's it's hard to imagine
[01:38:12] well we don't necessarily just have to imagine it we can listen to when I witness
[01:38:20] the widow I witnessed this is going back to the book this is transmitted by an American ambassador
[01:38:25] to the secretary state says this a week before anything was done to bayboard the villages all
[01:38:32] around had been emptied and their inhabitants had become victims of the John Darm's and margarine bands
[01:38:41] three days before the starting of the Armenians from bayboard after a week's prison imprisonment
[01:38:48] our bishop had been hanged with seven other notables after these hangings seven or eight other notables
[01:38:56] were killed in their own houses for refusing to go out of the city 70 or 80 other Armenians after
[01:39:02] being beaten in prison were taken to the woods and killed the Armenian population of bayboard was
[01:39:07] sent off in three batches I was among the third batch my husband died eight years ago leaving me
[01:39:14] and my eight year old daughter and my mother extensive possessions so that we could so that we were
[01:39:20] living in comfort since mobilization began the merch has come common don has been living in my house
[01:39:27] free of rent he told me not to go but I felt I must share my the fate of my people
[01:39:34] I took three horses with me loaded with provisions my daughter had some five
[01:39:39] lira pieces around her neck and I carried some 20 liras and four diamond rings on my person all
[01:39:44] else that we had was left behind our party left June 1st 15 gen darm's going with us the party
[01:39:52] numbered four five hundred persons we had got only two hours away from home when bands of villagers
[01:39:59] in large numbers with rifles guns axes etc surrounded us on the road and robbers of all we had
[01:40:10] the jondarms took my three horses and sold them to local Muslims pocketing the money they took
[01:40:15] my money and that from my daughter's neck also all our food after this they separated the man
[01:40:23] one by one and shop them all within six or seven days every mail above 15 years old
[01:40:31] by my side we're killed two priests one of them over 90 years of age
[01:40:40] these bandsmen took all the good looking women and carried them off on their horses
[01:40:46] very many women and girls with us carried off into the mountains among them my sister
[01:40:51] whose one year old baby they threw away a turk picked it up and carried it off I know not where
[01:41:00] my mother walked till she could walk no further and dropped by the roads I don't a mountain top
[01:41:06] we found on the road many of those who had been in previous sections carried from bayboard
[01:41:11] some women among them were killed and their husbands and sons
[01:41:16] we came across some old people little infants still alive but in a pitiful condition
[01:41:24] having shouted their voices away we were not allowed to sleep at night in the villages but
[01:41:30] lay down outside under cover of the night indescribable deeds were committed by the jondarms
[01:41:37] bandsmen and villagers many of us died from hunger and strokes others were left by the roadside
[01:41:44] two people to go on one morning we saw 50 to six see wagons with about 30 turkish widows whose
[01:41:53] huntsbidden had been killed in the war and these were going to Constantinople
[01:42:00] one of these women made a sign to one of the jondarms to kill a certain Armenian whom she pointed out
[01:42:06] the jondarms asked if she did not wish to kill him herself at which she said why not
[01:42:12] and drawing a revolver from her pocket shot and killed him each one of these turkish
[01:42:21] hanooms which is a turkish lady had five or six Armenian girls of ten or under with her
[01:42:28] boys the turk's never wish to take they killed all of whatever age
[01:42:31] the worst and most unimaginable horrors were reserved for us at the banks of the year fradies
[01:42:43] the mutilated bodies of women girls and little children made everybody shudder
[01:42:51] the bandsmen were doing all sorts of awful deeds to the women and girls that were with us
[01:42:57] whose cries went up to heaven at the fradies the bandsmen and jondarms threw into the river
[01:43:05] all the remaining children under 15 years old those that could swim were shot down as they struggled
[01:43:11] in the water after seven days we reached Erzingian not an Armenian was left alive there the
[01:43:25] turkish women took my daughter and me to the bath and their showed us many other women and
[01:43:32] girls that had accepted Islam between there and andrays the fields and hillside were dotted
[01:43:42] with swollen and black and corpses that filled and fouled the air with their stench
[01:43:47] on this road we met six women wearing the ferage and with children in their arms
[01:44:02] but when the jondarms lifted their veils they found that they were men in disguise so they shot them
[01:44:07] after thirty two days journey we reached Constantinople
[01:44:21] one of the things that would happen on the trail of tears on this road to death
[01:44:29] was you know by the time you got a week out of any of these cities where people were deported
[01:44:37] a lot of the american consulate people and other diplomats and missionaries who were there
[01:44:41] including by the way this is really worth mentioning that i've been brought up yet a lot of the people
[01:44:44] diplomats who have reported on this and broke back about it and have provided a lot of material we
[01:44:50] have today these are German diplomats austrian diplomats these are people who are allied to the
[01:44:55] Ottoman Empire in this war who were writing back about a lot of these things there's one memoir
[01:44:59] that was written about it by a guy named rafael denogales who was a venezuelin mercenary who was
[01:45:05] actually serving as a turkit as a mercenary officer as a major in the turkish military and he wrote
[01:45:11] a lot about it as well and one of the things that you hear over and over again is how by the time
[01:45:18] you're a week out of the city all these people are naked all their clothes have been taken so they're
[01:45:22] walking in july or august maybe in the Syrian desert 12 hours a day or more you know and they're
[01:45:31] just blistered up from the sun they don't have any food they don't have any water anything they
[01:45:36] can scrounge from the landscape or bag of some or prostitute from some turkish soldier or something
[01:45:42] that's all they got something maybe they were able to hide away on their person and so they're
[01:45:46] wasting away naked in the sun and then they would stop at night and you think maybe they would
[01:45:51] get some rest but more often than not the nighttime was the worst time because they would stop for the
[01:45:57] evening and as ever they didn't have tens most of the time those would all would have
[01:46:03] all been taken from them they didn't have any kind of shelter so they're just sitting out
[01:46:06] in the weather and if there was a village nearby or a tribe nearby or sometimes just the soldiers
[01:46:13] themselves this was their time to blow off a little bit of steam and so they would show up and they
[01:46:18] would just be walking through the encampments of all of these women and children and elderly people who
[01:46:23] who stopped and they would just take their pick for rape they would take slaves sometimes they
[01:46:29] would just torture people for entertainment their stories of pretty Armenian women being
[01:46:36] strip naked and forced to dance for turkish soldiers and when they weren't pleased with their
[01:46:41] performance they just doubted the encarricine and watched the veranda death for their entertainment
[01:46:46] there's story after story after story after story like this and not a bunch of people from
[01:46:52] one caravan we're talking from all over the country throughout the entire period of this going on
[01:46:58] there's something you know there's maybe you can get people to go put a bullet in somebody's head
[01:47:06] for their country you can maybe play play up that angle of it to get them to do something like that
[01:47:12] you've got a really in general level of extraordinary hatred I think to to get people to do some
[01:47:22] of the things that were being done here especially the regular people that doesn't go so much for
[01:47:27] the special organization you know I think I think maybe in one of the unraveling episodes we did I
[01:47:35] asked a question like if you had a bar in town in any city in America where everybody knew that's the bar
[01:47:41] where in there there's this room and there's a person in there and you can just do whatever you want to
[01:47:45] that's the gimmick at the bar like I might not go there you guys might not go there but I don't think
[01:47:50] it would be empty I think it would rarely be empty and when you're talking about okay what if you had
[01:47:55] that in a prison that would be a lively joint I mean that's what you had going on here you had these
[01:48:01] caravans of women children and old people being marched down into the desert very often by
[01:48:07] guards who were from the special organization guys who were convicted murderers and rapists
[01:48:15] who had been given complete in total license from their government to do whatever they want and
[01:48:19] now you stop at nighttime and your board you've been on the road for a week riding in the hot
[01:48:25] sun on your horse guarding these people and what are you how you're going to spend your evening
[01:48:31] and the way a lot of them spent it was just you know again you just it's one of those things that
[01:48:37] like reading a book about it or anything just you really can't do justice until you really try
[01:48:43] just close your eyes and try to put yourself in the position of these people in the position of
[01:48:47] a mother who's already watched two of her children die of exposure and then has her baby grab
[01:48:55] by a leg and thrown in a river and then she's gang raped and she's going to be gang raped again
[01:49:00] and again and again for the next two months as she walks you know this road or until she can't take
[01:49:06] it anymore and commit suicide basically that was the situation of hundreds of thousands of people
[01:49:15] being marched down into the desert like this well you said story after story after story
[01:49:25] here's some of them going back to the book and you mentioned the German diplomats
[01:49:31] here's a German diplomat the teachers of the American school and car per were gruesome
[01:49:36] torture before they were killed two professors had their hair and beard ripped out while in prison
[01:49:44] in order to extort confessions and were hung by their hands for days at a time
[01:49:52] another professor went insane when he was forced to watch Armenians being beaten to death
[01:49:58] the governor himself took part in the torture of another professor
[01:50:01] the senior executive president beat him until he was exhausted and said whoever loves his
[01:50:09] religion and his people may continue beating
[01:50:17] here's another eyewitness who was seven years old at the time we heard afterward that together with
[01:50:23] 17 other Armenian young men they had mastered them by night and had thrown them under the bridge
[01:50:29] thus when we were deported there were no males left in our family they took away my five
[01:50:39] aunts in der Zor later they cut their off their heads impaled their heads with their banats to show
[01:50:47] them to us and then they threw their corpses in the yearfraidies
[01:50:52] we found only half the body of my mother's aunt my mother buried her in the earth here's a
[01:51:04] 13 year old eyewitness the Turks came and drove us all out of the village they were forcing
[01:51:13] us to march with whip strokes they tied our hands behind us they disrobed us totally and we stood
[01:51:20] naked as the day we were born then they broke once hand another's arm still another's leg
[01:51:27] with axes and daggers behind us a little boy whose arm was broken was crying and calling for
[01:51:37] his mother but the mother had already died by an axe they came in the morning assembled us
[01:51:47] and started once more to kill and drop the bodies in the water below the cave the river
[01:51:54] cover was flowing they caught someone's head another's leg still another's hand and all these
[01:52:00] human parts were piled up upon one another on the ground some were not yet dead but had their
[01:52:10] bone shattered and their hands severed some were crying others squeaking there was the odor of blood
[01:52:19] on the hand and hunger on the other people who were still alive started to eat the flesh of the dead
[01:52:30] one of the effects of this was a very strange demographic dynamic that happened in Turkey in
[01:52:47] the years afterwards it was actually a book that came out it was in the 2000s or the 90s when it
[01:52:53] actually came out must have been the 2000s was written by a Turkish woman living in in Istanbul now
[01:52:59] her grandmother pulled her aside when she was very old and told her her life story and it turned out
[01:53:07] her grandmother was an Armenian and she had been taken as a small girl away we mentioned earlier one
[01:53:13] of the one of the Turkish women who were heading back to Constantinople with a stable of 678
[01:53:20] little Armenian girls and they were taking them back to be their house servants and that's how her
[01:53:24] grandmother was taken she was taken back into a house she ended up in a place that was pretty civilized
[01:53:30] they pretty much just raised her you know she was kind of a servant but they didn't abuse her or
[01:53:35] anything and so she was raised in this house and became Turkish she remembered who she was but
[01:53:40] everybody thought she was a Turk her granddaughter thought she was a Turk and so after she told her
[01:53:45] granddaughter her life story she wrote the she wrote the she wrote the book and it was kind of a sensation
[01:53:51] and Turkey because to this day Turkey still denies the genocide and so something that they
[01:53:59] well we'll talk about that a little bit but that aspect of it the taking of children and women
[01:54:04] the mass enslavement of these people was it was a huge section it's almost gosh man you would almost
[01:54:12] think that like it almost seems like a fake worst in death the people who have killed your husband
[01:54:19] your parents your kids your entire community your entire people and now they're gonna take you as a
[01:54:26] slave most of the most often when you're talking about the women they're being taken away as sex slaves
[01:54:31] and very often they're being taken away not by not that this would make and I guess any better but
[01:54:35] they're not being taken away by some Turkish notable to go be in his haram in Constantinople they're
[01:54:40] being taken away by some some tribesmen out until his tent in the desert and that's where she's
[01:54:48] gonna live now until they get tired of her and it's maybe not just for him you know a lot of
[01:54:52] times these were women who would be kept to be shared with friends and companies like a matter of
[01:54:58] hospitality you know this kind of thing was going on and you're talking about oh gosh I mean it's
[01:55:04] hard to really say but you're talking tens of thousands at least of our menian women and children
[01:55:10] taking away this way you know maybe a hundred maybe over a hundred thousand the total number of deaths
[01:55:15] between one one point five million but the number of people who were taken away is slaves and just
[01:55:20] kind of melted into the population or were murdered later that's what happened to a lot of these people it was
[01:55:24] it was in the ten at least the tens of thousands you know sex slavery in the Ottoman Empire that
[01:55:30] this isn't something that just sort of came out of nowhere because of the chaos it was going on
[01:55:35] there was actually just last night as I was brushing up on some of this I came across in New York
[01:55:39] times article written in 1886 by a journalist who managed to he had a he had a guide there in
[01:55:48] Constantinople that was helping them and they dressed him up in a beard and said he looked like
[01:55:52] you know he was from the area and he had some money and they got him into some of these places
[01:55:56] where they were selling women and this was in 1886 none of this was going on and they would
[01:56:01] they were mostly so there's always Christian women usually you're not you can't enslaved
[01:56:05] Muslims sometimes you know people do what they do but generally speaking that's what happened and
[01:56:09] so it would be Circassians and Slavs and Armenians and sometimes a series of Greeks
[01:56:16] and so this was something that you know that the Sultan himself the way the Sultan reproduced was
[01:56:23] he had a harem of hundreds and hundreds of women and all of them were slaves taken from Christian lands
[01:56:29] and they would be kept in a cell in like a very specific part of the palace and they would be guarded
[01:56:34] by black like black African unix and so I mean just again give you some idea of like the
[01:56:41] society we're talking about here the king has hundreds of slave women kept in cells and like his
[01:56:48] own palace they're not allowed to interact with anybody else and they're guarded with
[01:56:52] they're guarded by unix who were castrated specifically for the purpose I mean this is a
[01:56:57] it's a different we're not talking about you know the abundance dog or the English parliament or
[01:57:02] something it's just a different different time in a different place I mean we do after remember that
[01:57:06] you know we're I just mentioned that New York Times article in 1886 it only 21 years before
[01:57:11] was when we got rid of you know Chatelle slavery in the United States so it was a different time and
[01:57:16] there were a lot of things going on back then but there's a there's a little bit of exotic
[01:57:20] strangeness to something like that that I think kind of shocks us a little bit and this idea that
[01:57:25] you know you could take especially non-Islamic women as spoils of war and a sex slavery we saw
[01:57:32] that reignite when ISIS you know rampaged through everywhere they were taken to Yazidis and
[01:57:36] everybody else that they found it wasn't Muslim as sex slaves and it was horrifying to us but
[01:57:42] you know in this part of the world especially when you get out into the countryside where things
[01:57:46] don't change much very rapidly this was something that was not a huge diversion from what was normal
[01:57:54] for people and so once there was the opportunity it just happened at scale and you had tens of
[01:58:01] thousands again maybe over a hundred thousand Armenian women and children who just disappeared into
[01:58:04] Kurdish villages and into Turkish homes set us up for a daresor yeah daresor was one of the main
[01:58:16] gosh what do you even call a place like that you want to call it a death camp but that sort of
[01:58:21] makes you think of the Nazi example where this is like a factory of death and it wasn't it wasn't that
[01:58:27] you had these these caravans that were being wound through the desert to be robbed and raped and
[01:58:32] killed and enslaved as they went and just eyewitness report after eyewitness report describes the
[01:58:39] road on the way down is just littered with corpses and body parts everywhere you go anytime there's a
[01:58:44] hill you look over the other side of it off the road and it's just filled with bodies back there
[01:58:48] the rivers are choked with bodies and body parts but some of the people survived some of the people
[01:58:55] just figured it out you just said people who were alive started to eat the flesh of the dead people who
[01:59:00] haven't had anything to eat for a month will do you lose your mind when you start to when you
[01:59:07] start to starve and die of thirst and exposure and some people made it and for those who made it
[01:59:14] tell was waiting for them you know at the place that they got to at the end of the line one of them
[01:59:24] called their Zor is basically big open air cages that they just pen people up in and there was
[01:59:34] no food and there was no water and there was no medicine and they just stayed in there and they died
[01:59:39] and now you know this wasn't Auschwitz with you know double razor wire fences you know multiple layers
[01:59:46] deep people could kind of get there and you know if you had an ability to do if you knew somebody
[01:59:52] who maybe came down there to give you a blanket or some food you might live a little bit longer than
[01:59:57] everybody else but people were dying by the 500 the thousands the 2000s a day just dying of disease
[02:00:03] and exposure and hunger and thirst and periodically massacre sometimes when another caravan would
[02:00:11] get there and they're just simply wasn't any room for anyone else they would either take that
[02:00:15] caravan or most often they would take people who were already degraded near the point of death
[02:00:19] and they would be like well we're moving you to the next location you're going south again
[02:00:24] everybody back on the road and there was nothing south they just marched them out there people who
[02:00:28] were already right on the point of death they would march them further into the Syrian desert
[02:00:32] they would just wander out there and die or be massacred the scenes in derseor that are described
[02:00:39] or really something beyond I mean it's a heronum is Bosch painting you know
[02:00:47] this is from the book no pen can possibly convey the suffering and misery of these exile
[02:00:56] Armenians persecuted wanders surrounded by savage gangs of police soldiers riding in thousands of
[02:01:03] wagons and carts and on beasts of burden though most were on foot and many of those bear
[02:01:13] like dried leaves driven by the wind they passed through this sold bloody passage
[02:01:18] and on to the arid deserts of derseor to die without bread without water without a shroud
[02:01:27] and without a grave barely had the men from these regions been separated from the women
[02:01:34] and put on the road to exile when they were mercifully slaughtered and their corpses thrown
[02:01:39] into the rivers or valleys as food for vultures and other wild animals
[02:01:43] the young brides and virgins were yanked from the embrace of their crying mothers
[02:01:51] and taken to Turkish herems even ten year old girls were subjected to all manner of savage
[02:02:02] unbearable debotuary the older women who managed to endure the terrible hardships of the road
[02:02:12] were taken to derseor where they were brutally slaughtered during the summer of 1916
[02:02:21] here we encounter two young Armenian engineers who had been in charge with overseeing the work of an
[02:02:26] Armenian labor battalion in tears they told me how in 1915 particularly in September and October
[02:02:34] approximately 80,000 Armenians of both sexes were encamped under tents made from bedsheets and
[02:02:41] rags on the plain near the valley stretching all the way to the spacious swampy field by the
[02:02:47] Mamure Railway Station
[02:02:51] 600 to 700 were dying daily from hunger thirst and fever when suddenly a lengthy
[02:02:58] nocturnal autumn rain came and finished the task left unfinished by the human beasts
[02:03:04] the people were stuck in the standing pools of water for several days severe cold
[02:03:12] insert ensued and none of them had adequate shelter clothing or food
[02:03:20] they froze to death by the thousands falling like the autumn leaves or they died from
[02:03:25] dysentery diarrhea bleeding and other plagues of overcrowding the field was soon covered with
[02:03:34] mounds of unbearied bodies under makeshift tents and entire families were reduced to corpses
[02:03:40] by hunger and cold with no one to bury them nor could those Armenians who found their dead
[02:03:49] kinfolk find any spades or hose to bury them with and behold suddenly one morning
[02:03:59] to bring this widespread and heart-trending wretchedness to its ultimate perfection the director of
[02:04:06] the exiled caravans and hundreds of police soldiers bearing whips and clubs surrounded the poor
[02:04:12] people already at death store and ordered them to get immediately on the road it isn't
[02:04:17] humanly possible to imagine the hue and cry the begging and pleading and the chaos that
[02:04:23] prevailed in and around those thousands of tents the tents were then taken down and the portable
[02:04:29] goods and bundles representing the deportees last bits of property were assembled but they had
[02:04:34] neither carts nor wagons nor beasts of burden to carry them the lamentation then began
[02:04:42] many would not leave loved ones who were sick in their death throws lying on the ground
[02:04:46] uncaired for and abandoned the dying agast beg not to be abandoned in the open fields as food
[02:04:53] for hungry wolves and corpse eating hyenas that prowled the night but they had no time to think
[02:05:03] the military police and major and minor officials fell upon them without pity or human feeling they
[02:05:09] struck the hapless and confused left and right hitting them everywhere eyes burst open
[02:05:15] skulls were crushed faces were covered with blood and new wounds were opened up nobody cared
[02:05:21] nobody took pity on them the survivors seeing that they had no option but to leave
[02:05:30] took down and folded thousands of tents and in an instant throwing them over their shoulders
[02:05:36] got on the road leaving their ill and dying loved ones behind
[02:05:40] the wretched Armenian mothers who unable to take their underage children two to six years old
[02:05:50] children who had fallen ill from starvation extreme cold and the hardship of the long road
[02:05:55] half dead or in the throws of death had to leave them on top of the already dead
[02:06:00] tearfully the eyewitnesses told us how two large mounds of corpses of thousands of Armenian
[02:06:10] children rose up among them numerous children who had not yet died and who extended their small hands
[02:06:17] searching for their mothers the eyes of these omaciated and neglected angels bore a look of
[02:06:26] pleading and protest directed toward their mothers and toward God and from their half dead lips
[02:06:38] some of them cried that sacred word mommy for the last time
[02:06:48] since their mothers could not possibly take the children along in a few hours the little ones would
[02:06:53] be dead and would have to be left on the road anyway it was perhaps better that all of them
[02:06:59] the offspring of the same wretched and persecuted nation lay down in heaps in one place
[02:07:05] maybe God and men would finally have pity and see that this was suffering enough
[02:07:14] instead of half dead children mothers carried on their bosoms the weakest and most exhausted
[02:07:18] of the children still alive until they too had to be abandoned the angelic souls of thousands of
[02:07:28] Armenian children were rising to heaven to tell God of their beloved mothers endless sufferings and
[02:07:33] misfortunes those remaining in the care vans of Armenian axiles moved on and disappeared into the
[02:07:43] mountains there was an all encompassing silence as night came then the howling and yelping
[02:07:54] of hungry wolves jackals and foxes and occasionally the faint screams of Armenian children
[02:08:01] being eaten for the animals would eat the live ones first
[02:08:19] and that that wraps up what we're going to cover from the book and and of course obviously
[02:08:27] I only read a tiny percentage now to to get the book across the game some kind of
[02:08:36] understanding of of what took place and I mean what what can be called for all practical purposes
[02:08:49] is is I don't know if this is a thing to say but this was for the most part this was a successful
[02:09:02] genocide I mean it was damn near as fully successful genocide meaning we got rid of this group of
[02:09:09] people forever yes is that I mean there are Armenians in other countries obviously so the people
[02:09:17] survived but there are no Armenians in Turkey today and in fact Christians in general and again
[02:09:24] I don't mean to dilute the Armenian experience here but it is worth mentioning that this was something
[02:09:29] the Turks were attacking Christians across the empire this period they killed 300,000 a
[02:09:34] Syrian Christians they killed countless Lebanese Christians and after the war when out of Turk came
[02:09:42] back and they were fighting in the west against the Greeks he killed and then killed 300,000 Greeks
[02:09:47] Greek Christians and then expelled another million to a million and a half you know there were
[02:09:54] three or four million Armenians in Turkey proper before the war started and when it was all over
[02:10:02] by 1917 really when when the genocide kind of died down maybe tens of thousands crawled out of
[02:10:09] their hiding places went from three or four million to maybe a few tens of thousands and you
[02:10:17] have to call it in a way successful because from one standpoint Turkey got what it wanted there are
[02:10:25] no more Christians or Armenians in our country and from you know from another angle they didn't
[02:10:34] really pay for it some individuals didn't we'll get we'll get to that but you know after the
[02:10:42] one of probably the great tragedy the 20th century here's another one of its consequences was
[02:10:47] the Russian Revolution in 1917 the Bolshevik the communist take over Russia in 1917 and pull them out of
[02:10:54] the war and so the Armenians who have been hiding behind Russian lines that's where a lot of the
[02:11:00] Armenians in eastern Anatolia retreated just get behind the Russian army or the Russian army packed up and left
[02:11:05] they're out of the war and so you have all of these Armenians now right up into the what we
[02:11:11] consider today are a media proper the Republic of Armenia is wide open it is wide open over there and
[02:11:18] there is still a Turkish army in the field that is fully prepared to finish the job and they are driving
[02:11:25] up into Armenia they're driving toward the capital of Armenia yeravan talking about a Turkish army
[02:11:33] tens of thousands strong a fully equipped military force world war one air military force and you've
[02:11:38] got about 1200 Armenian soldiers and then you've got a bunch of refugees and older men and everything
[02:11:45] else who are given guns clubs anything that they could find which is not much and they're told
[02:11:51] do we flee up into Georgia up further into the Soviet Union depending on how bad this gets or
[02:11:59] are we gonna we gonna make a stand here and that's what they did
[02:12:04] there were people in yeravan lots and lots of refugees so it was an overcrowded place they had a lot of
[02:12:09] people but they only again had about 1200 train soldiers and they were the ones that went and got
[02:12:14] everybody organized they rang the bells of the church bells of yeravan to muster everybody and you had
[02:12:19] women and children running supply lines everywhere getting everything in place you had men digging
[02:12:23] defensive fortifications you had old men serving as like signal operators with flags and things up
[02:12:29] on you know up on towers everybody was participating here and the Turkish army pushed up
[02:12:35] within you know just about within visual range just over the horizon of the capital of Armenia
[02:12:41] and they got to a place there were three areas where they fought but the main one that you know
[02:12:46] people remember today there's a great big monument there and a great museum Armenian history museum
[02:12:51] called Sardara Bot and thankfully this French guy it's not a it's not a very well-known battle
[02:12:57] if you look in general histories they'll talk they'll all talk about it but they won't get much into the
[02:13:02] details thankfully there was this French guy back in the 70s a historian who went back
[02:13:06] into the records and he got everything I mean he's a military historian and so I read that book and
[02:13:11] I mean he really gets down to like the order of battle on both sides and everything else and I mean
[02:13:15] you're really talking about a fully equipped Turkish army against a rag tag group of refugees led by a few
[02:13:22] trained NCOs basically and thankfully they did have some Armenian
[02:13:27] Russians who once the Soviet Union pulled them out of the war they were like well
[02:13:31] you know I'm a colonel in the Soviet army now I guess do I go back to Moscow or wherever they're calling
[02:13:36] us or am I going to stay here in fight and so some of them stayed and helped lead the effort as well
[02:13:40] and this rag tag group put a halt it's Sardara Bot to the Turkish advance and really I mean
[02:13:46] there was a historian American historian not not Armenian but just a historian of the
[02:13:51] Ottoman Empire who said that if they had lost that battle then the word Armenia today
[02:13:57] would just be a curious historical footnote you know we'd probably still have Armenians obviously
[02:14:02] just like we had Jews for a long period of time when there was no such thing as Israel but that's
[02:14:07] what we would be talking about you know it didn't preserve Armenian independence at the time
[02:14:15] they tried you know one of the things that happened was in that brief period after they did put a stop
[02:14:19] to them Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan which are all right there clumped together none of them
[02:14:26] wanted to be part of the Soviet Union at the time and they didn't want to be part of the
[02:14:30] Ottoman Empire either so they formed a little alliance to try to defend themselves but as soon as
[02:14:34] things got a little bit tricky Georgia was pretty quick to be like you know what we're going to
[02:14:39] go with the Soviet Union and Azerbaijan was very quick to be like you know what what Muslims too
[02:14:44] and they kind of stabbed the Armenians in the back and attacked them from behind and so the
[02:14:48] Armenians then at that point had to cut a deal with the Soviet Union and so Armenia became
[02:14:51] a Soviet socialist republic as well and so out of the out of the frying pan into the fire there
[02:14:58] you know although I mean you know the thing is one of the things that did happen in Armenia
[02:15:03] obviously you know they were under the same Soviet tyranny is everybody else to some degree but they
[02:15:08] did understand the Soviets even. Sanatical is they were they understood to a certain degree that these
[02:15:13] people were not going to give up their national or religious identity no matter what we'd have to
[02:15:21] finish the job that the Turks started if we were going to accomplish that and so they really didn't
[02:15:25] push that as hard as they did in some other places which is why you know to this the Armenian church
[02:15:30] was able to survive and then to this day once they achieved their independence finally in
[02:15:35] you know when the Soviet Union fell everything was in place there and you know say what you want
[02:15:42] about the downsides of I don't know what you would call it of nationalism or just sort of that
[02:15:49] you know um I got you Armenian is one of the things that you find about them and it's something I love
[02:15:55] about Armenians really like any Mediterranean peoples is Armenian's love being Armenian and it makes
[02:16:03] some it makes them so much fun you know it's just to me like Armenians in America they're almost
[02:16:08] a perfect immigrant group in a sense where they are they're American 100% you know you can't look at
[02:16:16] the Kardashians and be like those are Americans those are Americans as much as George Washington's
[02:16:21] an American you know it's just they they fully adopt and like they're down they join the military they do
[02:16:26] everything and fully assimilate and integrate and yet they love Armenia and they love the Armenian
[02:16:32] church and they love their people and their history and there's no tension there you know they
[02:16:38] they can be fully patriotic Americans or in France there's a lot of Armenians in France for example
[02:16:43] and they never lost that connection with their own history and um in their own traditions and
[02:16:49] I think they they really walked out line really well um well it's um it doesn't have to be mutually
[02:16:56] exclusive to be you know proud of where you're from they're proof that it was and proud of where you're
[02:17:00] from yeah they're proof that it doesn't and they didn't um they also didn't really forget no they didn't
[02:17:06] forget you know one of the things what had happened yeah one of the things that happened right is
[02:17:10] another consequence of the Russian Revolution is you have all of the you know by the top by the end of
[02:17:15] the war everybody knows what was going on in Turkey so you had the British and the Americans and
[02:17:18] everybody else who were looking at the Ottoman Empire or now it's just the Republic of Turkey right
[02:17:23] there's the the war in Turkey went on until 1924 the British defeated the Ottoman Empire they occupied
[02:17:30] Constantinople but there was still large military force commanded by a great man there was no
[02:17:37] way to put it you know he was a he was a hard man he did a lot of bad things in the field and
[02:17:41] did what he had to do for his country I suppose one way to look at it but come out out of Turk the father of
[02:17:45] the Turks father of the modern Turkish Republic he was in command he was in he was he was a hero
[02:17:51] at Gallipoli the man who out of fight knew how to command very smart very tough and he was still
[02:17:56] out there and so he moved the capital from Constantinople where the British had established themselves
[02:18:02] out to Ankara where it is now and he kept fighting you know he um it first was pushing up into the
[02:18:07] caucuses to you know with the idea that if you get past Armenian Georgia and you keep going northeast
[02:18:13] there it's just Turkic peoples like all the way over to western China at that point so there was
[02:18:19] this like pan Turkish idea that maybe okay we lost all the North African whatever but maybe
[02:18:24] you know the Arabs were always kind of trouble anyway why were we doing that maybe this is the
[02:18:27] empire this pan Turkish Empire the Armenians it's so darabat put a stock to that and then the Soviet
[02:18:32] Union established itself so that wasn't going to work out and so they retreated back and eventually
[02:18:37] they went back and pushed everybody else out of their country and um established the modern
[02:18:42] Republic of Turkey and Kamal Atturk was he was a young Turk he was a member of the young Turks
[02:18:48] um he had broken with the triumph or a little bit uh over you know military reasons over the years
[02:18:55] but he was still part of these people and a lot of the young Turks and even the committee of
[02:18:58] Union and progress the core group that was really carrying all this out they were still there they
[02:19:02] were still in the government you know there was no real we had denotsification after the second
[02:19:08] World War and there was really not a whole lot of that going on some of the very very main people
[02:19:13] you know they fled they they fled the country and so this wasn't carried out but they were tried
[02:19:18] in absentia some of them were sentenced to death some of the main architects um but after a little while
[02:19:25] everybody realized that Turkey is going to be kind of strategically important now that we have this huge
[02:19:30] threat of the Soviet Union looming up here and so like it or not we're going to have to kind of
[02:19:36] find a way to like bring Turkey back into the fall the mean Turkey was in NATO by the 1950s
[02:19:42] and it was considered a strategic necessity to just kind of forget about all this you know you get
[02:19:48] all the way up to the 1980s and there was a um an American scholar named Susan Blair who found a
[02:19:55] bunch of the American consulate documents that people hadn't people didn't even know about these yet
[02:20:01] you know because nobody was studying this it was not something that people really wanted to look into
[02:20:05] because Turkey we we have nuclear weapons and turkeys is a it's a premium important ally in the
[02:20:10] cold war nobody wants to look at this and so in the 1980s Susan Blair finds all these documents by
[02:20:15] people like Leslie Davis describing everything that they've seen out there and she says well this
[02:20:19] is incredible right set up as a book tries to get it published she can't get it published anywhere
[02:20:24] she's told by major publishers that this is too controversial we we can't touch this and the thing is
[02:20:30] those people were right because she finally found a publisher and that publisher started getting bomb
[02:20:36] threats they started getting death threats she and her family had to go into hiding for a while
[02:20:41] because uh the Turkish government they don't play around like um have you seen that movie the promise
[02:20:48] no it's it's a great movie it's about the Armenian genocide and it's a really really good movie
[02:20:53] but you wouldn't know that I maybe this has changed a little bit now you wouldn't know that by going
[02:20:56] on like rotten tomatoes the first night or first day that that thing was released there were like
[02:21:02] 5,000 like one star terrible horrible worst movie ever reviews and like all of them had kind of
[02:21:08] broken English and like whatever else I mean you see that and then immediately afterwards literally
[02:21:13] like the next year there was another Armenian genocide movie that was put out it was sponsored by
[02:21:18] the Turkish government and it was just it's almost worth watching for just the the the madness of
[02:21:25] the propaganda I mean you really have to like imagine a movie about the Nazis and the Holocaust
[02:21:31] where all of the SS officers and Heinrich Kim learned everybody else are just portrayed it's like
[02:21:36] they're just really trying to help all these Jews but like the Jews they just they ran off out
[02:21:41] there into Poland and something happened to them and I don't I mean it's that bad you know it's really
[02:21:45] that bad and it is like a state effort ever since then um you know it was happening at the time
[02:21:51] they were they a lot of this was carried out with burn after reading telegrams and things like that some
[02:21:56] of them were preserved but um throughout the 20th century all the way up to the present day there's
[02:22:02] Turks still going through all the archives and going through it and being out shred that shred that they've
[02:22:06] been doing it for centuries and it's because they I mean look um this is this is maybe one of the
[02:22:12] darker things to point out about it is they know they know the deck at work you know people forget
[02:22:19] things people forget everything it doesn't matter what you did or how bad it was or how many people
[02:22:24] were affected they have this idea that if you just keep denying it keep calling everybody a liar keep
[02:22:31] just do whatever you got to do the give it a century all we have to do is survive you know if you
[02:22:37] if you look like this was something that was really prominent at the time right you read all the
[02:22:40] read the writings of Lenin for example and Trotsky and Stalin you know all the Bolsheviks and you
[02:22:46] see the same strain in Hitler where they all understood that we're about to do something that is
[02:22:51] horrific and barbaric and that is going to be condemned by everyone and we better not lose this war
[02:23:00] but if we don't if we pull it off and all we have to do is survive and then wait it out
[02:23:06] and the storm will pass and um it passed very quickly like I said Hitler was partly inspired by
[02:23:14] you know the the Armenian example specifically because even by then just 30 years later 25 years later
[02:23:22] at that point when I got started even by then he could say and make a good point with it who
[02:23:28] today remembers the Armenians this is 25 years after his own country was allied to the Ottoman
[02:23:37] Empire as it executed one of the most thorough and complete genocides in history well you can say
[02:23:47] there was some level of vengeance on it and we're not going to talk about that now but we are going
[02:23:55] to talk about operation nemesis on the unraveling podcast which we also do it's a little
[02:24:03] take things a little bit different and a little bit deeper and we'll do that we'll talk about
[02:24:08] operation nemesis well you can listen to it right now it's um jocco unraveling podcast where
[02:24:14] Daryl and I are going to go deep well we're going to go deep on on this operation that carried out
[02:24:20] it was a what did you call it a campaign of assassination that's exactly what it was and and it was
[02:24:26] done by a bunch of Armenians without any state support you know if you think about
[02:24:31] everybody looks looks like what the masad did the Israelis did after the second world war they
[02:24:36] hunted down a thousand fifteen hundred Nazi officers SS officers around the world and that's you know
[02:24:44] that's that's good for them but the Armenians you had a group people who were doing this completely
[02:24:48] independently without any state support this group of hardcore militants who hunted these people down
[02:24:53] all around the world and essentially took out the entire Ottoman government that was running this
[02:24:58] during during the period all the high ranking people there is one other thing I want to close with I kind
[02:25:03] of forgot about earlier because there is uh to on the whole question of turkish denialism um
[02:25:10] this is a quote from a letter written by the leader of the special organization a guy named
[02:25:16] behind the inch of care and this was a letter that was found fairly fairly recently last few decades
[02:25:22] um this is right near the beginning of it he said the committee of union in progress as the
[02:25:28] bearer of the nation's honor has decided to free the homeland from the inordinate ambitions of
[02:25:33] this accursed nation and to assume the responsibility for the blemish that will stain
[02:25:38] Ottoman history in this regard the committee which cannot forget the country's bitter and unhappiness
[02:25:43] and whose cup runeth over with unrelenting desire for revenge has decided to annihilate all Armenians
[02:25:50] living within Turkey not to allow a single one to remain and has given the government broad authority
[02:25:55] in this regard on the question of how this killing and massacring will be carried out the central
[02:26:00] government will give the necessary instructions to the provincial governors and army commanders
[02:26:05] all of the unionist regional representatives would concern themselves with following up on the
[02:26:10] matter in all of the places where they were found and would ensure that not a single Armenian would
[02:26:15] receive protection or assistance not a lot of room for doubt there evil
[02:26:31] with that echo Charles maybe we could do a little decompression old school decompression
[02:26:38] scenario that was a rough one say a second yeah I don't I'm not sure that I can do that right
[02:26:45] this moment but Jesus man it kind of hard to listen to all that and then even that last part
[02:26:50] and then be like yeah by the way yeah it let's all start you know get back to lifting weights
[02:26:55] and drinking well if you remember like I think the very first time I actually needed the decompression
[02:27:03] I want to say it was podcast number 12 didn't take long but after podcast number 12
[02:27:09] where we were we talking about the the highlander in prison and you know he's getting tortured by
[02:27:18] the Japanese he's having the the maggots eat the gangrene flesh off of his legs in order to survive
[02:27:27] he gets put to a medical camp eventually gets put out to see while he's you know
[02:27:33] um you know the whole of a ship with however many hundreds of prisoners shooting all over themselves
[02:27:40] and in their own urine and sweating and starving to death and dying and then they get hit by
[02:27:44] because the because the Japanese didn't mark their prison ships so they get hit by a torpedo
[02:27:50] and most of the guys die but he somehow gets thankfully recovered oh but but recovered by a
[02:27:55] Japanese ship and so then from his Japanese ship he gets taken back to shore and he is stationed
[02:28:01] in a prison camp in the outskirts of hero shima so that was the first time where when I got
[02:28:09] done reading some of his you know some of that book you know I said echo you talk for a little while
[02:28:17] why freaking decompress so world can be a horrible place and the best thing we can do is maybe
[02:28:24] make our little part of the world a little bit better what do you got for suggestions wow
[02:28:30] let's start with our self mentally and physically hopefully don't forget I give you a hard time
[02:28:40] about your job being super easy yeah this is one time you got to earn you know earn challenge
[02:28:45] just a little for sure challenges rough transitions yeah well either way want to keep
[02:28:50] ourselves together mentally fit and speak at a witch dill cooper always impressive with how deep
[02:28:56] you can just sort of just go thank you time well you know good guns I you have little ways to go
[02:29:02] which is cool you know and I'm very supportive of and you know either way we are working out
[02:29:08] we're reading not as much as del cool but tell me what I can do to maybe to maybe catch up okay well
[02:29:13] you could have get some stuff over he's got skills on the transition right now very good support
[02:29:18] on the trans actually a big tip either yes we're working out we're reading we're doing all this
[02:29:23] good stuff for ourselves so we can provide good stuff for others can make our little world a better
[02:29:29] place and it spreads and before you know it we got a better place we're all living in
[02:29:32] I'm in full support so this so while working out we might need some supplementation
[02:29:37] probably helps the time helps all right let's start with discipline go right mental and physical
[02:29:45] support we'll say and we have essentially an energy drink you don't like it still
[02:29:53] it's hard to say that bro because here's the deal when you say essentially an energy drink what
[02:29:58] do we think in this stigma we're thinking stigma we're thinking we're not just a stigma it's a
[02:30:02] reality yeah reality is we you say energy drink you're talking about high sugar content ridiculous
[02:30:08] caffeine bunch of chemicals to preserve the whole scenario we're talking I want to talk an energy
[02:30:13] we're talking poison yeah that is the association for sure so well we're talking about that
[02:30:19] we're not talking about that in fact I don't think we're ever gonna be talking about well technically
[02:30:24] we're talking about it but when I'm talking about discipline go the RTD ready to drink
[02:30:31] can of quantum quote essentially an energy drink this is what I'm talking about no chemicals
[02:30:38] no sugar no taste good and it's good for you you drink two of these you know how people
[02:30:45] you know we have friends I don't want to name any names Tim Ford he used to be might still be
[02:30:51] odd enough but they'll get addicted to like energy drinks we'll get addicted to him meanwhile
[02:30:56] without addiction you're getting less healthy less you know like you don't need drink three
[02:31:00] of them you're like man that probably is jamming my health up this is probably no it's straight up
[02:31:05] is straight up yeah but this will need drink three of them guess what your health there so go get
[02:31:10] addicted if you want get addicted to something good for you it's like getting addicted to carrots
[02:31:16] you can't you can't you can't you can't I know that I know that I actually learned that one time
[02:31:21] I had a whole like bag of carrots and then realized and and I you know whatever it was three hours
[02:31:26] later as googling can you eat too many carrots and the google said yeah your body can't
[02:31:31] digest too many carrots and so guess what your body does is not pretty don't eat too many carrots
[02:31:38] but you can drink a lot of this one go yeah and not to go too deep into the too much of a good
[02:31:44] thing concept but even technically the most vital nutrient if you want to call it water you can drink
[02:31:51] too much water yeah it's called drowning diet no I think that's when you inhale the best thing about
[02:31:57] to go energy drinks yeah I was one of those douche bags I was pounded like 300 milligrams of
[02:32:04] caffeine I came in here one time with one of those things in chocolate like what are you drinking
[02:32:09] what are you doing here so so I switched over a while back and here's where I was like I always thought
[02:32:14] that I needed a huge amount of caffeine I drink one of those 300 milligrams things and after like
[02:32:19] an hour I was just dead again I was like I guess I need 600 milligrams wrong I guess I need cocaus
[02:32:25] the opposite of the truth because I actually switched over to these things which are like 95 I think
[02:32:29] I only need one of them and I hit one of those things and it's good maybe I'll drink another one
[02:32:34] if I got something to do in the evening but that's it there's a bunch of things that countered that
[02:32:37] caffeine you know when you've got sugar in there it's like okay cool you're gonna get an insulin
[02:32:41] head you're gonna bring you back down plus we've got thermal broning bromine in here things that
[02:32:45] that help that caffeine in go helps it kick so you don't need to OD on it you last no need
[02:32:54] um hey we also got joint warfare for your joints we got criloil for your overall general goodness
[02:33:02] overall just general goodness in the world gets get yourself some criloil we got discipline
[02:33:07] going a powder form yeah by the way the the jacco pomer the iced tea combination I think on both
[02:33:14] I think on everything it's the best but that's what I like that's cool but I was mixing that up and
[02:33:19] that's a freaking good tastey little treat you pre-judged it to scenario milk protein protein like
[02:33:27] that chocolate peanut butter are you down with this exact your go to are we doing the decoder
[02:33:32] mire technique making pudding or whatever the thing yeah yeah yeah I mean what was the rest I think
[02:33:38] it's just like less milk or whatever but I think he put it in something like peanut butter something
[02:33:45] no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[02:33:49] you can make all kinds of tasty things with milk or you can just have milk as is which is also
[02:33:55] a tasty thing the peanut butter milk is a peanut butter is freaking delicious that thing is delicious
[02:34:02] oh yeah I wouldn't drink it just like as a normal treat normal dessert yeah that's the
[02:34:07] dichotomy of milk that dichotomy of milk is your like I want something good for me but I also

[02:35:40] song and then they saw that the tag on in wherever you know no no grown grandson it's true so
[02:35:48] origin USA with a jeans boots boots jiu jitsu stuff geese if you put on your rift
[02:35:55] g lately and that thing is really good it's not that thing is you don't have one here do you do
[02:36:02] when you this is not it's sort of like it's sort of like what energy drinks what go is to energy
[02:36:08] drinks rift geese is to geese it's that freaking hype good enough you're so frustrated if you
[02:36:14] ever have to put on our normal gig and you'll be mad literally you'll be mad at you that actually
[02:36:19] happened to me I was like I'm kind of mad right you don't want none of that geese rashguards joggers
[02:36:26] if you're a jogger type human which echo trolls happens to be I go in and out for sure
[02:36:31] no yeah a lot of good stuff all american made out origin USA dot com also jocco as a store
[02:36:38] discipline equals freedom shirts hats hoodies okay want you just break into the scenario we have
[02:36:46] the the unfortunate scenario yeah well I you know I didn't find it as unfortunate as maybe
[02:36:53] maybe you did well of course not because you took care of yourself you got to look out for
[02:36:58] number one you took care of yourself so of course you're happy you're over here you've got
[02:37:03] you got a cool shirt that I don't have I incidentally halfway took care of myself
[02:37:09] and it just kind of came to light check in your attention so okay so we got this thing okay on
[02:37:14] jockel store you click on the shirt locker SHURT creative you made it okay
[02:37:22] okay creative yeah so sure actually I didn't make up somebody on twitter oh yeah Instagram
[02:37:28] the Graham someone told me call it the shirt locker I was like yeah you fully approved
[02:37:34] anyway so it's a subscription situation for shirts creative designs you had a question mark
[02:37:42] I feel like there was a question mark in your head about like oh what a creative designs
[02:37:46] yeah well I don't know what that means but they look cool and now you just were wearing the
[02:37:52] other day on the mats of justice and I don't have it and then you explain that I can no longer get it
[02:38:00] that's so anyways if you want to get cool shirts you don't want to miss out yeah so and and that
[02:38:04] actually when you kind of explained a little bit of like yeah that is kind of a thing it's
[02:38:08] it's because it's hard to communicate like hey the shirts are gonna be like cool maybe not what
[02:38:13] you're used to all the time but they will be cool to have whatever maybe that's an indication
[02:38:18] that people don't really trust your assessment of what's cool it's not be that isn't may the
[02:38:23] facts are these it's hard to be like hey guys get this they're gonna be cool and then that's
[02:38:28] sort of it maybe it's just your personality that you like me I think we have this similarity
[02:38:32] we don't like sitting here saying like hey I'm making something and it's gonna be cool
[02:38:36] that yeah so that would be whack that makes sense yeah so I'm gonna say echo's been making
[02:38:40] some stuff and it's cool and if you want to get it then you gotta go get that shirt locker on
[02:38:46] including myself because apparently yes if a cool shirt gets made that actually says discipline
[02:38:51] if you're gonna want it I don't get a version I don't get a pair what is it a copy a copy
[02:38:58] issue an issue I'm getting a huge nothing okay so this this was the thing from the beginning
[02:39:03] if you remember shirt locker you get you get a shirt that month and it's gone you don't we don't
[02:39:08] sell them on the on the store it's gone that's why you sign up for the shirt locker so you can get them
[02:39:12] every month yeah so you can't come to me after everyone's already arrived and be like where's mine
[02:39:17] it's like well again I think we we have to take some always can't blame everyone we have to take
[02:39:22] and ownership and be like hey the ownership is we have failed to convey the level of
[02:39:29] coolness of the shirts that are coming so if you want to if you want some get your shirt locker on
[02:39:35] yeah that's about that yeah so just go store dot com also don't forget about the just the
[02:39:41] year everyday representing on the path it's not an easy path but if you're representing it is
[02:39:48] your heart path yes or something you know and if you're representing let's face it it makes that path
[02:39:52] a little bit more I don't know what you're doing more something enjoyable yeah it's true hey subscribe

[02:40:34] strange things happening in the podcast world in the whole world censorship random people being
[02:40:42] pulled off of platforms we don't know what's gonna happen and we would be stupid not to have
[02:40:47] some kind of a contingency plans we have a contingency plan of if we need to we don't want to but if we
[02:40:52] need to we can survive some kind of a traumatic platform of end where if they want to start putting
[02:41:03] advert to injecting advertisements into this podcast or whatever we don't want to have that happen so
[02:41:08] we need to have an alternative platform we're building it we don't want to take sponsors and have people

[02:42:34] you know well you know me carry you got some stuff cooking so you know who maybe well allow you
[02:42:39] the assistant director I assume it's I assume it's a slow cooker as usual psychological warfare
[02:42:47] I made an album telling echo how to overcome his moments of weakness and he recorded it and now
[02:42:54] you you can listen to it psychological warfare you people ask me for a alarm clock yeah can just
[02:42:59] get that and you can put it as your alarm that's why we did it MP3 check that out whatever you get

[02:43:10] wall keep you on the path got a bunch of books obviously you can go to jockelpodcast.com slash
[02:43:17] books and you can order books from the podcast is this one I don't know if you're going to be
[02:43:22] able to order this one I had this one in my collection it's a used copy I don't know if it's still
[02:43:28] available but it's Armenian Golgotha you can try and get well we'll see if we get if it's available
[02:43:35] we'll get it up there final spin I wrote a book that is a fiction book I can't novel to me just doesn't
[02:43:44] sound cool does it sound cool do you know even especially if I was like I wrote it no that sounds weird right
[02:43:52] yeah it doesn't match it doesn't match does it doesn't match does it so I need to come up with another
[02:43:57] word maybe I'll come up with another word like mulk but for like something that's kickass that's not true
[02:44:02] that's a story mulk and then I can be like oh I wrote a whatever that thing is okay and that way I
[02:44:09] can still you know feel feel good about it yeah that's a good idea because I don't this is not my thing
[02:44:15] like I wrote a novel yeah I mean like technically what's the technical definition of a novel
[02:44:20] there DC oh if you start wanting to differentiate it between a novella and a novel it gets very
[02:44:27] hairy sometimes maybe let's say a hundred pages I think it's pretty I think it's pretty well you're
[02:44:32] talking about the difference between extreme ownership yeah no I am talking about I'm talking about what's a
[02:44:36] novel yes it's like category have you ever what's a cool novel that you've read or you've read
[02:44:41] blood and reading okay that's the only cool not well I'm maybe there's some other ones but yeah blood
[02:44:47] but you call blood-mrading a novel yeah okay then I guess I'm down with a kind of
[02:44:52] because blood-mrading it's better yeah but then the next step is to call yourself a novel is
[02:44:56] you ready for that because I wrote a novel writing line with freaking blood-mrading
[02:45:04] I'm a novelist who wrote a novel the the story is called final spin it's available for pre-order
[02:45:10] right now but look the publisher's thinking he's gonna buy a book by this knuckle dragger
