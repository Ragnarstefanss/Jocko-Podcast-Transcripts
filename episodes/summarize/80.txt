And in those cases, when you're quote unquote outwork, you know, what imaginance, easy to just come, but like what I'm saying is just your everyday life, you know, you talk about like with your kids or something like that, is it easy to to boom, detach at a moment, notice or is it the kind But I think that as what they're trying to do, I think they know attention spans are short, but I also think that attention spans have been so coddled now that people actually want the long form and that's why I think podcast as in general are doing really well because people don't people want to get engaged and listen to an actual opinion or not even an opinion, but facts or. I can give you some perspective, and my perspective is, you know, for those, you've got to know if you're going to join the military, you better know that that's truly what you want to do. Yeah, so a lot of times in MMA where you see a guy, you know, boom, you got the other guy on the ropes and he maintains, you know, a guy getting too excited, you know, he risks punching himself out. If I try a GJ, you know, and then I try it again, you already know it's like if I try one on you, it's tight close, but you get out, you're defending it like crazy. But if you, if you, because think about it, if you have somebody that truly is in a high thread area, you know, you take a woman or an older person that doesn't have great physical strength and they're in a high thread area to tell them that, you know, learning jiu jitsu is going to be the best thing for them is wrong. What, you know, like, like, you know, we'll be walking down the street, there'll be some kind of a situation in the street. Like those are cool, you know, but what do you, if you want to, I, and I think a lot of people they want to sit down, they want to see these guys shaping boards. They got sales, they got to do, they got numbers, they got to reach, they got all these things going on. It really seems like that's like the goal, you know, to make it, to have it be just like a young condition. yeah, where the dim rock where you're going to like, I'm going to touch your neck and you're going to fall back. I think it was Joe Rogan was saying, you know, when you're talking about podcasts themselves, you know, you're saying the news people need to learn from podcasts. So it's like you're pulling the trigger the same way or whether or not there's going to be, you know, the same way. And it's crazy how the guys who go to debunk it, those like, you see, actually, one and one where the guys will go to the dojo and be like, hey, I'm a skeptic, you know, do your thing to me and knock me down. So, you know, we're talking, you know, taking normally it takes years, you know, four, five years to build an aircraft carrier. And to think about this, we do, we have, we have, we like things and you know what we generally like? That each thing I've done that before, like actually a lot of times just to see not because one would see a tough I can be with not scratching the edge, but just to see like what's going to happen to the edge? Yeah, and you hear that romantic story, where, you know, this guy did that, you know, he was tired of his job, so he just humped and quit and then he got desperate and he fell back and all this stuff. You ever hear two people debating or something, not professional debaters or nothing, but there are going to point, you know, one guy's point versus the other guy's point. Of course, if you teach someone some aggressive movements that they're going to do, and they're going to memorize those movements, and then they do it to a person that doesn't know how to fight. And you're actually helping too because when you write a review and you kind of let people know what's up with it, what's up with the podcast, then they go, oh, this sounds like something I should listen to. You know, like, I know how to breathe. Like if you have another round, let's say you're on your last set of like, I don't know. For leaving your job that you don't like anymore, because you want to start something new, set things up, set up an extra strategy, plan for it, suck up the job that you don't like while you're saving money while you're getting a landing place ready. Like there's times where Dean, I know exactly what he's going to do. Thus the science of martial arts involves the presence of mind to act and see where the enemy is like a mountain and act as a mountain when the enemy is like a sea. So or you're going to not panic, or you're going to dreadfully defend that position harder and you're going to sacrifice across side. It just, you know, when you get caught off guard, it's like, oh, you got your mind has to explore all these options. Like if there's litsa, if it's like a cited issue, you know, you say the one and there's so many details and nuance to it. They are actually failing because they are trying too hard to make people happy, they are trying too hard to adapt to what people are the feedback that they are getting and like what are your principles? They got some knots in them and they're a little bit crooked and what you have to do is you have to learn how are you going to use them, where you're going to put them. Now, doing four years, a four year hitch in the Marine Corps, the Army, in the Navy, in the Air Force, it's going to be good for you, and it's not like it's a light permanent lifetime thing, and it'll probably teach you a lot. But like I'm not going to die, I can make it to this evening when I'm going to eat a nice big dinner. And then the more experience you got, the more level headed you got, you can always tell a good balancer when they, you know, they can come in, they can take a children knock it. That's one of the things that's so good about the master is because with the interaction, it can be hard for people to birth these ideas from their own mind, like, to take the seed that comes from extreme ownership or comes from the podcast to take that seed and and plan it and have it grow. But just... Back to the book, knowing that mentality, taking straight forwardness as basic, taking the real mind as the way, practicing martial arts in the broadest sense, thinking correctly, clearly and comprehensively, taking emptiness as the way you see the way as emptiness. Hey, we put them on there for four minutes if someone doesn't like this subject, they'll got someone else coming on and you know, in four minutes later after the commercial break. If you didn't know what that is, which I know many people do, but in the event of you not knowing in this case, psychological warfare is an album with tracks. And I'm not going to do all of them, but I'm definitely going to give enough to give the feeling of the book, which is very, it's very instructional in the way it's talking to you, which I dig.
