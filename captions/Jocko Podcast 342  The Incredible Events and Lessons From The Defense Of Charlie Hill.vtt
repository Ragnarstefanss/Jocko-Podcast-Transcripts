00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is Jocko podcast number 342 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.64 --> 00:00:06.60
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:06.60 --> 00:00:07.44
Good evening Echo.

4
00:00:07.44 --> 00:00:08.28
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.88 --> 00:00:11.68
The explosion rocked them,

6
00:00:11.68 --> 00:00:13.96
the blast deafening in the night.

7
00:00:13.96 --> 00:00:15.46
For an instant it let their,

8
00:00:15.46 --> 00:00:18.24
lit their dirty blood smeared faces,

9
00:00:18.24 --> 00:00:22.76
their hollow eyes set in hopeless determination.

10
00:00:22.76 --> 00:00:25.12
A few more shells crashed around them,

11
00:00:25.12 --> 00:00:27.24
none as close as the first.

12
00:00:27.24 --> 00:00:30.72
Each blinding flash shown upon the corpses,

13
00:00:30.72 --> 00:00:32.32
lying across the battlefield,

14
00:00:32.32 --> 00:00:34.12
gruesome evidence of the fight

15
00:00:34.12 --> 00:00:36.44
that had raged over the past days.

16
00:00:37.44 --> 00:00:41.40
Hundreds lay dead over the hilltop outpost.

17
00:00:41.40 --> 00:00:43.84
The bodies of South Vietnamese paratroopers

18
00:00:43.84 --> 00:00:47.68
mixed with those of their determined North Vietnamese enemy.

19
00:00:47.68 --> 00:00:50.44
The hellacious battle had allowed the paratroopers

20
00:00:50.44 --> 00:00:54.16
to recover only some of their fallen comrades.

21
00:00:54.16 --> 00:00:56.36
They'd wrapped the number in their plastic ponchos

22
00:00:56.36 --> 00:00:58.56
and placed them in trenches.

23
00:00:58.56 --> 00:01:01.48
That was a while ago, earlier in the fight,

24
00:01:01.48 --> 00:01:04.40
when there'd been time to render a modicum of respect.

25
00:01:05.28 --> 00:01:09.72
Later, they'd stacked bodies and rows as they were able.

26
00:01:09.72 --> 00:01:11.92
Most of the dead though were strewn

27
00:01:11.92 --> 00:01:15.32
where they'd been cut down in the last hours of combat.

28
00:01:15.32 --> 00:01:19.12
Punctured, torn, dismembered and shredded,

29
00:01:19.12 --> 00:01:23.08
grotesque reflections of their final violent seconds of life.

30
00:01:23.08 --> 00:01:28.08
The explosion stopped, the dark returned.

31
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.36
Only the moans of the wounded pierced

32
00:01:31.36 --> 00:01:33.32
the silence of the night.

33
00:01:33.32 --> 00:01:35.92
The stench of death filled the nostrils

34
00:01:35.92 --> 00:01:38.92
of the last two men fighting.

35
00:01:40.24 --> 00:01:42.52
Smoke choked their lungs.

36
00:01:42.52 --> 00:01:44.56
They waited in anticipation.

37
00:01:45.56 --> 00:01:48.62
They heard orders shouted from across the field.

38
00:01:48.62 --> 00:01:53.62
They sensed movement as another attack wave swept toward them.

39
00:01:55.06 --> 00:01:57.70
The American advisor leaned close

40
00:01:57.70 --> 00:02:00.62
to his Vietnamese counterpart and exclaimed,

41
00:02:00.62 --> 00:02:03.42
shit, here they come again.

42
00:02:04.82 --> 00:02:07.98
The reply in broken but well-practiced English

43
00:02:07.98 --> 00:02:12.78
was resolute, I know, we fight, we fight more.

44
00:02:14.86 --> 00:02:17.62
The enemy once again rose from the darkness,

45
00:02:17.62 --> 00:02:19.82
tearing through the night, coming at them

46
00:02:19.82 --> 00:02:22.18
as vague shapes, screaming and shooting,

47
00:02:22.18 --> 00:02:26.18
throwing grenades as they advanced closer and closer still.

48
00:02:26.18 --> 00:02:31.18
Both US Army advisor, Special Forces Major John Joseph Duffy

49
00:02:31.36 --> 00:02:35.04
and South Vietnamese Major Lee Van May,

50
00:02:35.04 --> 00:02:38.46
the senior surviving battalion officer knew

51
00:02:38.46 --> 00:02:40.66
this was the final assault.

52
00:02:40.66 --> 00:02:42.62
Bullets whizzed by them.

53
00:02:42.62 --> 00:02:47.18
A grenade exploded, ripping a hole in Major May's chest.

54
00:02:47.18 --> 00:02:48.66
He gasped for air.

55
00:02:50.58 --> 00:02:54.42
John Duffy, already wounded several times himself,

56
00:02:54.42 --> 00:02:56.82
looked over his left shoulder.

57
00:02:56.82 --> 00:03:00.66
He nodded, satisfied, seeing the decimated force,

58
00:03:00.66 --> 00:03:04.50
all that was left of the once mighty 11th Airborne Battalion

59
00:03:04.50 --> 00:03:06.34
escaping down the hillside.

60
00:03:07.42 --> 00:03:10.82
John and May, the rear guard, were all that stood

61
00:03:10.82 --> 00:03:15.54
between the remnants of the battalion and their annihilation.

62
00:03:15.54 --> 00:03:18.14
They'd been out of food for days,

63
00:03:18.14 --> 00:03:21.06
they had no water left in their canteens,

64
00:03:21.06 --> 00:03:23.50
their ammunition was nearly gone.

65
00:03:23.50 --> 00:03:27.50
But still the American and his South Vietnamese comrade

66
00:03:27.50 --> 00:03:30.42
fought and still the enemy came.

67
00:03:31.42 --> 00:03:35.30
There was no talk of surrender, no thought but to kill

68
00:03:35.30 --> 00:03:38.86
as many as they could before they were themselves

69
00:03:38.86 --> 00:03:41.18
cut down where they squatted on the edge

70
00:03:41.18 --> 00:03:43.14
of their abandoned positions.

71
00:03:43.14 --> 00:03:48.14
Lee Van May, strained to speak, fight Duffy, fight.

72
00:03:50.14 --> 00:03:51.94
They battled with everything that remained

73
00:03:51.94 --> 00:03:53.74
in their hearts and souls,

74
00:03:53.74 --> 00:03:56.14
but the end of their road was only minutes away.

75
00:03:57.74 --> 00:04:00.14
They knew they were about to die.

76
00:04:06.14 --> 00:04:08.74
And that right there is the opening

77
00:04:08.74 --> 00:04:13.74
of an incredible book which is called Extraordinary Valor,

78
00:04:14.54 --> 00:04:19.54
which is about the defense of Charlie Hill in Vietnam.

79
00:04:20.94 --> 00:04:25.94
And this book is written by retired Colonel William Reeder

80
00:04:26.74 --> 00:04:29.14
who was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam

81
00:04:29.14 --> 00:04:32.94
who has been on this podcast before, podcast number 63.

82
00:04:33.94 --> 00:04:35.94
And on that podcast, we discussed

83
00:04:35.94 --> 00:04:40.94
Colonel Reeder's first book which is called Through the Valley,

84
00:04:40.94 --> 00:04:44.14
which follows Colonel Reeder's combat experiences

85
00:04:44.14 --> 00:04:48.14
from flying a OV-1 Mohawk in support of secret missions

86
00:04:48.14 --> 00:04:50.94
in North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia,

87
00:04:50.94 --> 00:04:55.94
eventually switching to pilot the AH-1G Cobra gunship

88
00:04:57.94 --> 00:05:01.14
from the 361st Aerial Weapons Company,

89
00:05:01.14 --> 00:05:06.14
call sign Pink Panther, and it was in that duty

90
00:05:06.14 --> 00:05:08.14
that Colonel Reeder was shot down,

91
00:05:08.14 --> 00:05:12.14
evaded the enemy for three days, was eventually captured,

92
00:05:12.14 --> 00:05:15.14
imprisoned in a jungle prison camp, tortured,

93
00:05:15.14 --> 00:05:20.14
mock executed, and finally forced to march north

94
00:05:21.14 --> 00:05:23.14
to the Hanoi Hilton.

95
00:05:23.14 --> 00:05:26.14
And in that grueling march,

96
00:05:26.14 --> 00:05:29.14
where seven of the two men were killed,

97
00:05:29.14 --> 00:05:34.14
where seven of the 26 POWs in his group were killed,

98
00:05:36.14 --> 00:05:39.14
and upon arriving at the Hanoi Hilton,

99
00:05:39.14 --> 00:05:41.14
where he suffered the rest of his,

100
00:05:41.14 --> 00:05:43.14
with the rest of his American POWs

101
00:05:43.14 --> 00:05:48.14
until he was finally released after 320 days of captivity.

102
00:05:51.14 --> 00:05:55.14
So to hear that story, go listen to that podcast

103
00:05:55.14 --> 00:05:58.14
and to get the actual full story,

104
00:05:58.14 --> 00:06:00.14
get the book through the valley.

105
00:06:00.14 --> 00:06:03.14
There are, it's a harrowing story

106
00:06:03.14 --> 00:06:06.14
and so many lessons to be learned.

107
00:06:06.14 --> 00:06:08.14
But prior to that ordeal,

108
00:06:08.14 --> 00:06:12.14
then Captain Reeder flew in direct support

109
00:06:12.14 --> 00:06:17.14
of Major Duffy and the defense of Charlie Hill.

110
00:06:20.14 --> 00:06:23.14
And he knew that that was a story of courage

111
00:06:23.14 --> 00:06:25.14
and valor that needed to be shared.

112
00:06:25.14 --> 00:06:30.14
So he spent years compiling data

113
00:06:30.14 --> 00:06:33.14
and reviewing records and interviewing participants

114
00:06:33.14 --> 00:06:35.14
and giving his own personal account.

115
00:06:35.14 --> 00:06:38.14
In this book, Extraordinary Valor,

116
00:06:38.14 --> 00:06:44.14
and it is an honor to have Colonel Reeder here with us again

117
00:06:44.14 --> 00:06:50.14
to discuss this new book and his experiences from this battle

118
00:06:50.14 --> 00:06:52.14
and how this battle unfolded.

119
00:06:52.14 --> 00:06:56.14
Colonel Reeder, thank you for joining us again.

120
00:06:56.14 --> 00:06:57.14
It's an honor to have you.

121
00:06:57.14 --> 00:06:59.14
Thank you, Jaco.

122
00:06:59.14 --> 00:07:03.14
So what made you decide to write this book?

123
00:07:05.14 --> 00:07:07.14
There's a little bit of a story involved,

124
00:07:07.14 --> 00:07:09.14
so we'll go ahead and share it.

125
00:07:09.14 --> 00:07:12.14
When I wrote my first book on my captivity,

126
00:07:12.14 --> 00:07:17.14
that book wasn't published until 2016, as I remember.

127
00:07:17.14 --> 00:07:21.14
So that was decades after that experience in Vietnam.

128
00:07:21.14 --> 00:07:23.14
But it was a book that I had wanted to write.

129
00:07:23.14 --> 00:07:26.14
I just never found the time staying on active duty,

130
00:07:26.14 --> 00:07:27.14
commanding units.

131
00:07:27.14 --> 00:07:29.14
It was just always too busy.

132
00:07:29.14 --> 00:07:31.14
Finally, I found the time,

133
00:07:31.14 --> 00:07:33.14
sat down and started to put pen to paper.

134
00:07:33.14 --> 00:07:36.14
And all of these memories and recollections

135
00:07:36.14 --> 00:07:37.14
that I thought were right there,

136
00:07:37.14 --> 00:07:39.14
because I had lived that experience,

137
00:07:39.14 --> 00:07:41.14
well, when I started writing,

138
00:07:41.14 --> 00:07:43.14
yes, some of those recollections were right there.

139
00:07:43.14 --> 00:07:45.14
I remember things crystal clear.

140
00:07:45.14 --> 00:07:49.14
Other things after all those years were a little bit fuzzy.

141
00:07:49.14 --> 00:07:52.14
So I wanted to be sure that I had all of my information correct,

142
00:07:52.14 --> 00:07:53.14
all of my facts correct,

143
00:07:53.14 --> 00:07:58.14
particularly in the war that led up to my getting shot down and captured.

144
00:07:58.14 --> 00:08:01.14
So I would talk to guys from my unit that I could get a hold of,

145
00:08:01.14 --> 00:08:04.14
talk to return prisoners that I had been with,

146
00:08:04.14 --> 00:08:07.14
to be sure I had everything as right as could be.

147
00:08:07.14 --> 00:08:09.14
One of the battles that I mentioned,

148
00:08:09.14 --> 00:08:12.14
and I think it only gets a few paragraphs in my first book,

149
00:08:12.14 --> 00:08:14.14
was this battle at Fire Base Charlie.

150
00:08:14.14 --> 00:08:17.14
And I talked to the other crew member, Dan Jones,

151
00:08:17.14 --> 00:08:19.14
actually led our mission there.

152
00:08:19.14 --> 00:08:20.14
I was flying his wing.

153
00:08:20.14 --> 00:08:22.14
He shared what he recalled.

154
00:08:22.14 --> 00:08:25.14
Another one of our pilots, Forrest Snyder, shared what he recalled.

155
00:08:25.14 --> 00:08:27.14
But to get full detail,

156
00:08:27.14 --> 00:08:29.14
and I think it was Forrest recommended to me,

157
00:08:29.14 --> 00:08:31.14
he says, hey, you need to get a hold of the American advisor

158
00:08:31.14 --> 00:08:34.14
who was on the ground with that airborne battalion

159
00:08:34.14 --> 00:08:36.14
and get some information from him.

160
00:08:36.14 --> 00:08:40.14
So I tracked down the advisor, John Duffy.

161
00:08:40.14 --> 00:08:41.14
I got a hold of John.

162
00:08:41.14 --> 00:08:43.14
I hadn't spoken to him since the war,

163
00:08:43.14 --> 00:08:45.14
and now this is however many decades later,

164
00:08:45.14 --> 00:08:47.14
and I said essentially, you know,

165
00:08:47.14 --> 00:08:50.14
John, great to make contact with you.

166
00:08:50.14 --> 00:08:52.14
And he was enthused that we made contact with him.

167
00:08:52.14 --> 00:08:55.14
And as you see, we may bring out in the discussion later.

168
00:08:55.14 --> 00:08:58.14
Our mission that night that he was overrun,

169
00:08:58.14 --> 00:09:01.14
you read that part, we showed up in the nick of time

170
00:09:01.14 --> 00:09:02.14
to save the day.

171
00:09:02.14 --> 00:09:06.14
So he credits myself and Dan Jones who was flying lead

172
00:09:06.14 --> 00:09:09.14
with saving his life, as does Levan May.

173
00:09:09.14 --> 00:09:11.14
So he shared the information that I needed

174
00:09:11.14 --> 00:09:13.14
to get that battle correct for the few paragraphs

175
00:09:13.14 --> 00:09:15.14
I had in the first book.

176
00:09:15.14 --> 00:09:18.14
But as I talked to him over, I must have talked to him

177
00:09:18.14 --> 00:09:20.14
a half a dozen times getting that material

178
00:09:20.14 --> 00:09:24.14
over different days, he started dropping a hint that,

179
00:09:24.14 --> 00:09:27.14
you know, that was just a really intense battle.

180
00:09:27.14 --> 00:09:29.14
It was probably one of the most intense battles

181
00:09:29.14 --> 00:09:30.14
in the Vietnam War.

182
00:09:30.14 --> 00:09:34.14
And I had no idea that only 37 guys had survived

183
00:09:34.14 --> 00:09:37.14
out of a 471-man battalion,

184
00:09:37.14 --> 00:09:42.14
plus a few other stragglers which later showed up later on.

185
00:09:42.14 --> 00:09:44.14
So he started dropping these hints.

186
00:09:44.14 --> 00:09:47.14
Hey, somebody ought to write the history of that battle.

187
00:09:47.14 --> 00:09:49.14
And then he found and knew that I had a PhD

188
00:09:49.14 --> 00:09:52.14
and then retired colonel and had written that book.

189
00:09:52.14 --> 00:09:57.14
So finally I said, John, okay, I'll write it up.

190
00:09:57.14 --> 00:10:01.14
What I was thinking at the time is, you know,

191
00:10:01.14 --> 00:10:03.14
I'll take care of John and I'll write this,

192
00:10:03.14 --> 00:10:04.14
maybe a 20-page monograph.

193
00:10:04.14 --> 00:10:07.14
I'll get the facts down and I'll be done with it.

194
00:10:07.14 --> 00:10:10.14
But as I started talking to him in more detail

195
00:10:10.14 --> 00:10:13.14
and got to meet Le Van May and talk to him,

196
00:10:13.14 --> 00:10:14.14
others involved in the battle,

197
00:10:14.14 --> 00:10:18.14
I soon saw that there was really a substantial story there

198
00:10:18.14 --> 00:10:19.14
that needed to be told.

199
00:10:19.14 --> 00:10:22.14
And rather than a 20-page monograph that I would crank out

200
00:10:22.14 --> 00:10:27.14
in two to three weeks, I spent four years researching

201
00:10:27.14 --> 00:10:30.14
and writing this book to get it done.

202
00:10:30.14 --> 00:10:32.14
And I'm very glad that I did.

203
00:10:32.14 --> 00:10:36.14
I know that it is a story that needed to be shared.

204
00:10:36.14 --> 00:10:43.14
And also it shines a new light on Vietnamese forces.

205
00:10:43.14 --> 00:10:46.14
Vietnamese forces during the war and since the war

206
00:10:46.14 --> 00:10:51.14
have gotten generally bad press on how they performed in combat.

207
00:10:51.14 --> 00:10:53.14
Most of that was well-deserved.

208
00:10:53.14 --> 00:10:57.14
A lot of Vietnamese units, though they had some well-intended soldiers,

209
00:10:57.14 --> 00:11:00.14
they did not have good leadership, corrupt leadership

210
00:11:00.14 --> 00:11:01.14
and competent leadership.

211
00:11:01.14 --> 00:11:04.14
And there are story after story of Vietnamese units

212
00:11:04.14 --> 00:11:08.14
not fighting well, retreating in the face of the enemy.

213
00:11:08.14 --> 00:11:11.14
But what I found in researching this book,

214
00:11:11.14 --> 00:11:14.14
Extraordinary Valor, is that was not at all the case

215
00:11:14.14 --> 00:11:15.14
with their elite forces.

216
00:11:15.14 --> 00:11:17.14
Their Marines, their Rangers,

217
00:11:17.14 --> 00:11:20.14
and most especially their paratroopers.

218
00:11:20.14 --> 00:11:26.14
Their airborne units were the top-notch units

219
00:11:26.14 --> 00:11:28.14
that fought well, fought with courage.

220
00:11:28.14 --> 00:11:32.14
And as I did my research, I confirmed that.

221
00:11:32.14 --> 00:11:35.14
And that is the story that I tell in this book.

222
00:11:35.14 --> 00:11:38.14
The book follows the life of the American advisor.

223
00:11:38.14 --> 00:11:40.14
It follows the life of Le Van May,

224
00:11:40.14 --> 00:11:44.14
who ends up assuming command of the unit after the commander is killed.

225
00:11:44.14 --> 00:11:45.14
And they're the two big heroes.

226
00:11:45.14 --> 00:11:49.14
So the book is their story leading up to the battle.

227
00:11:49.14 --> 00:11:52.14
And that was how I came to write the book

228
00:11:52.14 --> 00:11:54.14
and why I wrote the book.

229
00:11:54.14 --> 00:11:56.14
And I think the important message that comes out of the book

230
00:11:56.14 --> 00:11:58.14
is the Vietnamese airborne.

231
00:11:58.14 --> 00:12:01.14
They called themselves, were known in Vietnam as the Mudo.

232
00:12:01.14 --> 00:12:06.14
The Red Hats, the Angels from the Sky, fought very, very, very well.

233
00:12:06.14 --> 00:12:10.14
And just about every single combat they were involved in,

234
00:12:10.14 --> 00:12:14.14
and most especially the 11th Arvin Airborne Battalion on Charlie Hill

235
00:12:14.14 --> 00:12:17.14
was extraordinarily valorous.

236
00:12:17.14 --> 00:12:25.14
In reading your book, you start to realize the way that this unit was held up,

237
00:12:25.14 --> 00:12:29.14
and this battle was held up almost like the Battle of Thermopylae,

238
00:12:29.14 --> 00:12:33.14
with the 300 Spartans that died to a man trying to protect the city.

239
00:12:33.14 --> 00:12:35.14
It's like the same thing happened here.

240
00:12:35.14 --> 00:12:39.14
They were trying to hold this hill, and there's songs about it.

241
00:12:39.14 --> 00:12:45.14
In the lore of the Vietnamese at the time, this unit was like the 300 Spartans.

242
00:12:45.14 --> 00:12:47.14
Is that a safe assessment?

243
00:12:47.14 --> 00:12:48.14
Yeah, it is.

244
00:12:48.14 --> 00:12:52.14
That battle became a landmark in Vietnamese history.

245
00:12:52.14 --> 00:12:54.14
The commander, as I said, was killed.

246
00:12:54.14 --> 00:12:58.14
He became a national hero, was promoted posthumously to colonel.

247
00:12:58.14 --> 00:13:02.14
They had banners to him all over Saigon and parades in his honor.

248
00:13:02.14 --> 00:13:06.14
There is a book written about the battle.

249
00:13:06.14 --> 00:13:09.14
I think it's something like The Red Flames of Summer.

250
00:13:09.14 --> 00:13:12.14
And then there was a song that was written about the battle

251
00:13:12.14 --> 00:13:17.14
that is still played at some Vietnamese gatherings that get together,

252
00:13:17.14 --> 00:13:20.14
and we'll play that song about Charlie Hill.

253
00:13:20.14 --> 00:13:27.14
The other interesting thing I found is there's recordings of you guys in the air.

254
00:13:27.14 --> 00:13:32.14
I listened to at least probably 40 minutes of these call for fires,

255
00:13:32.14 --> 00:13:36.14
and just like I was a radio man, so I wasn't surprised when this happened.

256
00:13:36.14 --> 00:13:39.14
But you can hear the aircraft really well, and you can barely hear Duffy.

257
00:13:39.14 --> 00:13:41.14
He's all broken.

258
00:13:41.14 --> 00:13:46.14
But man, it's amazing to listen to this stuff happening.

259
00:13:46.14 --> 00:13:48.14
These recordings are incredible.

260
00:13:48.14 --> 00:13:54.14
They are, and that recording in particular was part of the additional evidence.

261
00:13:54.14 --> 00:13:59.14
And we may get into Duffy's award situation here later, and I'll have more comment on that.

262
00:13:59.14 --> 00:14:04.14
But that recording surfaced late, just several years ago.

263
00:14:04.14 --> 00:14:08.14
Two of my principal sources, to be sure that my information was correct,

264
00:14:08.14 --> 00:14:14.14
were hard copy or hard vocal sources that couldn't be disputed.

265
00:14:14.14 --> 00:14:15.14
One was that recording.

266
00:14:15.14 --> 00:14:19.14
That recording was made by one of the helicopter crew members

267
00:14:19.14 --> 00:14:22.14
that went in and picked up the survivors of that battle the next morning

268
00:14:22.14 --> 00:14:25.14
after they were overrun on the hill that night.

269
00:14:25.14 --> 00:14:30.14
And so yes, we have audio, word for word conversations between all those helicopters,

270
00:14:30.14 --> 00:14:36.14
and Duffy talking on, he had his Prick 77 radio shot off his back.

271
00:14:36.14 --> 00:14:41.14
He had two aircraft survival radios with him as well.

272
00:14:41.14 --> 00:14:46.14
So he's talking on one of those survival radios on the emergency push to those helicopter crews.

273
00:14:46.14 --> 00:14:48.14
So we had that recording.

274
00:14:48.14 --> 00:14:55.14
Also, John Duffy during the battle kept a log of a journal of everything that happened every day

275
00:14:55.14 --> 00:14:58.14
and call signs and coordinates and all that.

276
00:14:58.14 --> 00:15:02.14
So those two things together helped give me the factual information

277
00:15:02.14 --> 00:15:08.14
or confirmed factual information for the book, as well as, and I'll add this comment now,

278
00:15:08.14 --> 00:15:13.14
if you want to get an emotional feel for John Duffy and an emotional feel for this book,

279
00:15:13.14 --> 00:15:18.14
because Duffy turned out to be a poet after the war and he has a website,

280
00:15:18.14 --> 00:15:22.14
epoetryworld.com, John Duffy, if you Google that, you'll get to it.

281
00:15:22.14 --> 00:15:27.14
But yeah, all of this is captured the emotion of it in poems that he has written over the years since.

282
00:15:27.14 --> 00:15:32.14
Yeah, and the title of one of those books is The Battle for Charlie,

283
00:15:32.14 --> 00:15:36.14
and it's a book of poems, and it's chronological accounting of what happened.

284
00:15:36.14 --> 00:15:38.14
Really cool to read.

285
00:15:38.14 --> 00:15:43.14
And I mean, I've got some of that that we'll read during this that I highlighted,

286
00:15:43.14 --> 00:15:48.14
but yeah, definitely an interesting guy that had a cool viewpoint on the world.

287
00:15:48.14 --> 00:15:50.14
He's a fascinating guy.

288
00:15:50.14 --> 00:15:53.14
With that, let's get into the book a little bit.

289
00:15:53.14 --> 00:15:58.14
And the book, like you already said, it staged around the two main leaders in this event,

290
00:15:58.14 --> 00:16:01.14
or who ended up being the main surviving leaders in this event,

291
00:16:01.14 --> 00:16:04.14
Leigh Van May and Major John Duffy.

292
00:16:04.14 --> 00:16:11.14
So you start off and again, look, go buy the book because the details that you've got in there are incredible to read.

293
00:16:11.14 --> 00:16:14.14
I'm going to kind of give some highlights so people know what we're dealing with.

294
00:16:14.14 --> 00:16:17.14
So Leigh Van May was born in 1942.

295
00:16:17.14 --> 00:16:20.14
He's the second of nine children.

296
00:16:20.14 --> 00:16:25.14
His father was a farmer, but I guess they raised buffalo.

297
00:16:25.14 --> 00:16:27.14
That's what they did for a living.

298
00:16:27.14 --> 00:16:31.14
They had, but they raised crops, but they had the two buffalo to,

299
00:16:31.14 --> 00:16:35.14
yeah, whatever you do, plow the fields and, yeah.

300
00:16:35.14 --> 00:16:36.14
Okay, got it.

301
00:16:36.14 --> 00:16:38.14
So the buffalo were more like the tractors.

302
00:16:38.14 --> 00:16:39.14
Yes, exactly.

303
00:16:39.14 --> 00:16:41.14
So they were regular farmers.

304
00:16:41.14 --> 00:16:48.14
He was a studious kid, hardworking, and he ends up getting accepted into the Vietnamese National Military Academy.

305
00:16:48.14 --> 00:16:54.14
Interestingly, he graduates the same day that Kennedy was assassinated November 22, 1963.

306
00:16:54.14 --> 00:17:02.14
And he had, you know, he kind of talked about the fact that he looked at Kennedy as this great man and this was, you know,

307
00:17:02.14 --> 00:17:06.14
somebody that he saw as a beacon of freedom and all this.

308
00:17:06.14 --> 00:17:15.14
He gets commissioned as a second lieutenant and he asks for immediate combat assignment.

309
00:17:15.14 --> 00:17:16.14
Right.

310
00:17:16.14 --> 00:17:25.14
And with that, well, when you're in Vietnam, I guess it doesn't take that long if you want to go to combat to get in it.

311
00:17:25.14 --> 00:17:27.14
I'm going to go to the book here real quick.

312
00:17:27.14 --> 00:17:30.14
He's a platoon leader at this point.

313
00:17:30.14 --> 00:17:31.14
Contact.

314
00:17:31.14 --> 00:17:34.14
Heavy enemy fire stopped their advance.

315
00:17:34.14 --> 00:17:37.14
The radio cracked with a call from the adjacent platoon.

316
00:17:37.14 --> 00:17:42.14
One, two, one, two, this is one, three over may grab the handset from his radio operator.

317
00:17:42.14 --> 00:17:44.14
One, three, this is one, two over.

318
00:17:44.14 --> 00:17:47.14
One, two, we are pinned down here.

319
00:17:47.14 --> 00:17:49.14
Heavy fire, lots of VC, maybe a company.

320
00:17:49.14 --> 00:17:52.14
Roger one, three, I'll try and advance and relieve pressure on you.

321
00:17:52.14 --> 00:17:54.14
May soldiers stopped in their tracks.

322
00:17:54.14 --> 00:17:57.14
He needed them to advance across an open expanse.

323
00:17:57.14 --> 00:18:06.14
His greatest anxiety in pondering his role in combat was not fear for his life, but rather whether his soldiers would follow his orders.

324
00:18:06.14 --> 00:18:08.14
He knew what was expected of him.

325
00:18:08.14 --> 00:18:11.14
He worried he might not be able to deliver.

326
00:18:11.14 --> 00:18:17.14
He spied two soldiers nearby whom he felt could be key to his budding plan.

327
00:18:17.14 --> 00:18:23.14
One carried a 30 caliber Browning automatic rifle known affectionately as the BAR.

328
00:18:23.14 --> 00:18:29.14
The other held a 45 caliber Thompson submachine gun, both designs dated to World War One.

329
00:18:29.14 --> 00:18:36.14
May boasted a more modern weapon, an M1 grand carbine that had seen service in World War Two.

330
00:18:36.14 --> 00:18:38.14
Come with me, he called to the pair.

331
00:18:38.14 --> 00:18:39.14
Stay close.

332
00:18:39.14 --> 00:18:44.14
May turned to the platoon, raised his arm and shouted, follow me.

333
00:18:44.14 --> 00:18:48.14
They moved forward, arching to the left, circling the enemy's right side.

334
00:18:48.14 --> 00:18:51.14
May stayed in the lead, firing his carbine.

335
00:18:51.14 --> 00:18:55.14
His two man assault force made good use of their automatic weapons.

336
00:18:55.14 --> 00:18:59.14
The rest of the platoon moved to keep up, placing effective fire as they advanced.

337
00:18:59.14 --> 00:19:04.14
They took casualties, individuals fell, wounded, some crying in pain.

338
00:19:04.14 --> 00:19:13.14
Still, his soldiers fired and maneuvered behind his lead until he got them into a position to attack directly into the enemy's flank.

339
00:19:13.14 --> 00:19:15.14
May led the onslaught.

340
00:19:15.14 --> 00:19:19.14
Insurgents fell, dead, dying and wounded.

341
00:19:19.14 --> 00:19:20.14
They broke.

342
00:19:20.14 --> 00:19:21.14
They ran.

343
00:19:21.14 --> 00:19:28.14
The second platoon pursued until May called them back to consolidate on the position they'd just overrun.

344
00:19:28.14 --> 00:19:30.14
He congratulated them on their victory.

345
00:19:30.14 --> 00:19:35.14
They looked at him with the respect and admiration he had earned.

346
00:19:35.14 --> 00:19:39.14
May exhibited extraordinary leadership on that first mission.

347
00:19:39.14 --> 00:19:50.14
Within days, the army promoted him to first lieutenant and placed him in command of the first company, and he routinely led company in battalion operations.

348
00:19:50.14 --> 00:19:58.14
The actions set his reputation as a respected combat leader.

349
00:19:58.14 --> 00:20:01.14
He's earning that rank.

350
00:20:01.14 --> 00:20:02.14
Yeah, he is.

351
00:20:02.14 --> 00:20:05.14
This reminds me of something to keep in mind too that we lose sight of.

352
00:20:05.14 --> 00:20:10.14
Americans went to Vietnam for one year deployments and came home.

353
00:20:10.14 --> 00:20:15.14
Infantry guys and aviators got to go two times, some three times.

354
00:20:15.14 --> 00:20:17.14
John Duffy ends up going four times.

355
00:20:17.14 --> 00:20:24.14
But those Vietnamese, we mentioned his commission date, so we're going back to the early and mid-60s.

356
00:20:24.14 --> 00:20:34.14
And those Vietnamese were fighting day after day, year after year throughout that whole war as we would do our rotations.

357
00:20:34.14 --> 00:20:37.14
I can only guess, I've not even asked May, I should.

358
00:20:37.14 --> 00:20:49.14
What was your attitude looking at these American advisors that would come in for a year or less at a time and rotate in, rotate out, and see if they've got all the answers for you telling you what to do and how to fight a war?

359
00:20:49.14 --> 00:20:57.14
Well, that's, I think, one of the complaints about that rotational system is guys come in by the time they feel comfortable with what they're doing.

360
00:20:57.14 --> 00:20:59.14
It's almost time for them to leave again.

361
00:20:59.14 --> 00:21:10.14
And I know they did that a lot with company and battalion leadership where a leader would come in and serve three, four, maybe five months as a battalion commander, as a company commander.

362
00:21:10.14 --> 00:21:12.14
And then they'd rotate them out.

363
00:21:12.14 --> 00:21:15.14
Just when you start to get comfortable with what's going on, you're out of there.

364
00:21:15.14 --> 00:21:18.14
And then soon after that, you're going back to the States.

365
00:21:18.14 --> 00:21:25.14
Whereas World War II, you were going to deploy until we won, which is definitely a different way to do it.

366
00:21:25.14 --> 00:21:37.14
Now, that being said, it's at least a little bit nice when you go to maybe run some combat operations in the morning and then that afternoon you go home and have dinner with your wife, right?

367
00:21:37.14 --> 00:21:40.14
And that's exactly what happened with May.

368
00:21:40.14 --> 00:21:44.14
He ended up, he met this woman.

369
00:21:44.14 --> 00:21:46.14
Her name was Sen.

370
00:21:46.14 --> 00:21:53.14
And, you know, like he starts having a relationship, but when he goes to work in the morning, he's going into combat.

371
00:21:53.14 --> 00:21:55.14
So that's a little different, too.

372
00:21:55.14 --> 00:21:56.14
Yeah, yeah, it is.

373
00:21:56.14 --> 00:22:04.14
And as I mentioned in the book, the Vietnamese Airborne was the strategic reserve for Vietnam forces controlled by the general staff.

374
00:22:04.14 --> 00:22:11.14
Their locations were all around Saigon with one of the units down at Vung Tau, which was not that far from Saigon.

375
00:22:11.14 --> 00:22:18.14
So when they weren't deployed off on an operation, yeah, May was going home every night and being with his family.

376
00:22:18.14 --> 00:22:20.14
And then they'd usually deploy the air.

377
00:22:20.14 --> 00:22:24.14
The airborne would get deployed if there was some horrible situation.

378
00:22:24.14 --> 00:22:34.14
They'd go up and save the day, spend usually just a few days or the most couple, two or three weeks, and then back to Saigon, back with his family.

379
00:22:34.14 --> 00:22:43.14
You know, you've got a section in the end of the book that you talk about where these airborne units, these Vietnamese airborne units, the history of them, where they came from.

380
00:22:43.14 --> 00:22:45.14
Can you talk us through that really quick?

381
00:22:45.14 --> 00:22:49.14
Because it's pretty interesting the way they were originally formed and where they're rooted.

382
00:22:49.14 --> 00:22:51.14
Yeah, I wanted to include that in the book.

383
00:22:51.14 --> 00:23:01.14
Because, again, I was really impressed when I did my research and found out the courage and valor of the Vietnamese airborne consistently throughout their history.

384
00:23:01.14 --> 00:23:08.14
Yeah, without giving you, you're talking to a PhD historian here, so I don't want to go off on an hour and a half lecture on the Vietnamese airborne.

385
00:23:08.14 --> 00:23:13.14
But the concise version is it all began with the French.

386
00:23:13.14 --> 00:23:18.14
Vietnam was a colony of France's since the late 1800s.

387
00:23:18.14 --> 00:23:25.14
During World War II, the Japanese invaded and took over Vietnam.

388
00:23:25.14 --> 00:23:31.14
We, the Americans, worked with the Vietnamese insurgents fighting against the Japanese during the war.

389
00:23:31.14 --> 00:23:34.14
There's a whole another story there that I won't get into.

390
00:23:34.14 --> 00:23:40.14
But anyway, after the war, the French came back trying to re-establish their colony in Vietnam.

391
00:23:40.14 --> 00:23:48.14
The Vietnamese, a portion of the Vietnamese under Ho Chi Minh had a militant arm called the Vietnam.

392
00:23:48.14 --> 00:23:54.14
And they very much saw themselves as an independent country and weren't going to stand for the French coming in to take them over.

393
00:23:54.14 --> 00:23:58.14
So we have a conflict between the French and the Vietnamese after the war.

394
00:23:58.14 --> 00:24:02.14
The French had Vietnamese that didn't want anything to do with the communists.

395
00:24:02.14 --> 00:24:04.14
That ends up becoming South Vietnam.

396
00:24:04.14 --> 00:24:12.14
But as the French tried to reassert themselves, looking to the, I want to say friendly Vietnamese, but those who are aligned with the French,

397
00:24:12.14 --> 00:24:17.14
they, the French had airborne units came to Vietnam.

398
00:24:17.14 --> 00:24:21.14
They saw some advantage to getting Vietnamese military to be part of that airborne.

399
00:24:21.14 --> 00:24:27.14
And that's where the whole thing started. They started training indigenous Vietnamese to become paratroopers.

400
00:24:27.14 --> 00:24:31.14
Those Vietnamese were trained and molded on the French model.

401
00:24:31.14 --> 00:24:38.14
In time, there were Vietnamese airborne companies that would fight as a part of French battalions.

402
00:24:38.14 --> 00:24:48.14
In time, by the time we get to the Dien Bien Phu battle, which is going to be the undoing of the French in Vietnam and Indochina in 1954,

403
00:24:48.14 --> 00:24:52.14
there are Vietnamese airborne battalions by that time fighting.

404
00:24:52.14 --> 00:24:54.14
So that was the start of the Vietnamese airborne.

405
00:24:54.14 --> 00:24:56.14
It started on the French model.

406
00:24:56.14 --> 00:25:01.14
There, and so they still to the U.S. involvement in the war,

407
00:25:01.14 --> 00:25:06.14
track their origins to the French and kept that same proud model.

408
00:25:06.14 --> 00:25:09.14
The red berets that they wore came from the French.

409
00:25:09.14 --> 00:25:14.14
And that's what, that's what May ends up volunteering for.

410
00:25:14.14 --> 00:25:24.14
After he spent some time in the infantry, he then volunteers for this elite Vietnamese airborne division.

411
00:25:24.14 --> 00:25:29.14
And you've got a bunch of good combat stories in there.

412
00:25:29.14 --> 00:25:33.14
Did you spend a lot of time talking to May retracing this stuff, huh?

413
00:25:33.14 --> 00:25:38.14
Yeah, over a period of four years, I talked to May, I don't know, I should look at my notes.

414
00:25:38.14 --> 00:25:40.14
I've got about 10 interviews with May.

415
00:25:40.14 --> 00:25:47.14
I've probably got 18 interviews with Duffy, half a dozen interviews with High,

416
00:25:47.14 --> 00:25:51.14
who we'll talk about in a little bit, but he ended up being the operations officer of the 11th Battalion.

417
00:25:51.14 --> 00:25:53.14
May is the executive officer.

418
00:25:53.14 --> 00:25:55.14
Colonel Bow is the commander.

419
00:25:55.14 --> 00:25:57.14
He gets killed in the battle.

420
00:25:57.14 --> 00:26:02.14
So I spent a lot of time talking to those guys, principally May, High and Duffy.

421
00:26:02.14 --> 00:26:07.14
At one time, I even flew down to San Jose, went to Santa Cruz, where Duffy lives.

422
00:26:07.14 --> 00:26:14.14
And May and High came down, we spent an entire day sitting around Duffy's dining room table.

423
00:26:14.14 --> 00:26:16.14
I had blown up some maps.

424
00:26:16.14 --> 00:26:23.14
I forget, I think I had one to, I don't know, 25,000 or something that I blew up into huge maps we laid on the table.

425
00:26:23.14 --> 00:26:26.14
We went over that battle in great detail.

426
00:26:26.14 --> 00:26:31.14
So yes, I've spent a lot of time with all of those guys to get this right.

427
00:26:31.14 --> 00:26:38.14
Next time you do that, can you tell me so I can come and watch and maybe even bring Echo so he can press record?

428
00:26:38.14 --> 00:26:40.14
That's phenomenal.

429
00:26:40.14 --> 00:26:42.14
I know we talked about maybe getting some of these guys on in the future.

430
00:26:42.14 --> 00:26:44.14
That'd be awesome.

431
00:26:44.14 --> 00:26:46.14
He ends up getting married.

432
00:26:46.14 --> 00:26:50.14
Did you record, did you record these interactions that you had before you go?

433
00:26:50.14 --> 00:26:51.14
I did.

434
00:26:51.14 --> 00:26:54.14
Well, every single interview I did on the phone, I recorded and I have those recordings.

435
00:26:54.14 --> 00:26:59.14
And that entire session we spent that day, I recorded the whole day.

436
00:26:59.14 --> 00:27:00.14
Yes.

437
00:27:00.14 --> 00:27:02.14
Oh, there's going to be some requests for that.

438
00:27:02.14 --> 00:27:11.14
Yeah, I don't, I think when I did those recordings, it was with their understanding that we were doing those in confidence that that would not be released to the world.

439
00:27:11.14 --> 00:27:17.14
He, so he gets married to Sen, this woman that he had met.

440
00:27:17.14 --> 00:27:18.14
Yes.

441
00:27:18.14 --> 00:27:20.14
He is enjoying life.

442
00:27:20.14 --> 00:27:22.14
He's got his comrades.

443
00:27:22.14 --> 00:27:24.14
You've got a section there.

444
00:27:24.14 --> 00:27:31.14
They drink this, this Martel cognac, which is very superior old pale.

445
00:27:31.14 --> 00:27:33.14
That's what's written on the bottle V Sop.

446
00:27:33.14 --> 00:27:34.14
Yeah, VSOP.

447
00:27:34.14 --> 00:27:41.14
VSOP is on the bottle and the paratroopers, they say that it doesn't stand for very superior old pale.

448
00:27:41.14 --> 00:27:43.14
It stands for very sexy old paratroopers.

449
00:27:43.14 --> 00:27:45.14
That's a fact.

450
00:27:45.14 --> 00:27:50.14
So there's some good, some good camaraderie with these guys.

451
00:27:50.14 --> 00:28:05.14
And, and again, it's just wild to think that these guys are working, they're living at home, they're with their family, and then they go on deployment for two or three weeks and do heroic stuff and then go back and get back with their family.

452
00:28:05.14 --> 00:28:08.14
It's a whole, it's a whole different kind of war fighting then.

453
00:28:08.14 --> 00:28:13.14
I mean, quote, yeah, I guess you could say the civil war, we did that in America.

454
00:28:13.14 --> 00:28:18.14
But I mean, other than that, we've been fighting in other countries.

455
00:28:18.14 --> 00:28:22.14
Had that just go home to your family at the end of a day of combat.

456
00:28:22.14 --> 00:28:24.14
Well, in most Vietnamese units didn't.

457
00:28:24.14 --> 00:28:29.14
This was the luxury of the airborne, but they, you know, they did more risk than anybody else.

458
00:28:29.14 --> 00:28:31.14
And you mentioned them getting married.

459
00:28:31.14 --> 00:28:35.14
They got married during the Ted or just at the end of the Ted offensive.

460
00:28:35.14 --> 00:28:45.14
And may had gotten deployed up to Way City during the, during the Ted offensive and fought and his, I think he was commanding a company then.

461
00:28:45.14 --> 00:28:49.14
And they got that down to 25% combat strength were no longer combat effective.

462
00:28:49.14 --> 00:28:54.14
So got sent back to Saigon to re outfit and refit and get ready for the next deployment.

463
00:28:54.14 --> 00:28:59.14
And it was on that break and after losing so much of your, of your unit and all those casualties,

464
00:28:59.14 --> 00:29:04.14
Sen and may decided, Hey, if we can't wait any longer, we need to get married.

465
00:29:04.14 --> 00:29:07.14
So that's when they got married.

466
00:29:07.14 --> 00:29:09.14
Yeah, you've got a bunch of those details in here.

467
00:29:09.14 --> 00:29:14.14
Obviously we're not reading the whole book. Go buy the book and get the rest of that story.

468
00:29:14.14 --> 00:29:17.14
Let's look at John Duffy. The other major character here.

469
00:29:17.14 --> 00:29:20.14
I'm going to go to the book because I like this intro.

470
00:29:20.14 --> 00:29:23.14
There is no question where John Duffy is from.

471
00:29:23.14 --> 00:29:26.14
He was born in Manhattan, moved to Queens at a young age and then Brooklyn.

472
00:29:26.14 --> 00:29:34.14
He never lost his accent or the peppering of profanities he picked up in the public schools and on the streets of the city.

473
00:29:34.14 --> 00:29:38.14
World War II rage during his early years. He was seven years old when it ended.

474
00:29:38.14 --> 00:29:40.14
He remembered it well.

475
00:29:40.14 --> 00:29:45.14
And then you kind of, you go through some of these. This is so much this just like a, should be a movie.

476
00:29:45.14 --> 00:29:50.14
This whole section about him growing up in and around the boroughs in New York.

477
00:29:50.14 --> 00:29:54.14
You know, he's like a smart kid, but he thinks school is boring.

478
00:29:54.14 --> 00:30:01.14
He's really good at math, but he skip in school, the whole nine yards, cutting class, just a rebellious kid.

479
00:30:01.14 --> 00:30:04.14
Sounds familiar actually in some forms.

480
00:30:04.14 --> 00:30:11.14
And then going back to the book when he was 16 a neighbor, a paratrooper in the hundred and seven hundred and eighty seventh airborne regimental

481
00:30:11.14 --> 00:30:15.14
combat team visited the family. He just returned from the Korean war.

482
00:30:15.14 --> 00:30:19.14
The war ended some months earlier, but the soldier was just now being sent home.

483
00:30:19.14 --> 00:30:25.14
He stood in the family's living room, his uniform sharp, his pants tucked into his tall, shine leather boots.

484
00:30:25.14 --> 00:30:28.14
John was impressed. The stories of war impressed him.

485
00:30:28.14 --> 00:30:32.14
The immaculate uniform with its badges and medals impressed him.

486
00:30:32.14 --> 00:30:40.14
But the shiny boots impressed John the most, the boots that only paratroopers could wear with their class A service uniform.

487
00:30:40.14 --> 00:30:45.14
Those highly polished brown jump boots caught his eye and his imagination.

488
00:30:45.14 --> 00:30:48.14
In that instant, John was hooked.

489
00:30:48.14 --> 00:30:51.14
Yes, paratrooper. That's what I want to be.

490
00:30:51.14 --> 00:30:55.14
As soon as he turned 17, he got his parents permission to enlist.

491
00:30:55.14 --> 00:31:02.14
He entered the army as a private two days after his birthday before finishing his junior year of high school. Get some.

492
00:31:02.14 --> 00:31:05.14
He breathed through basic and infantry training.

493
00:31:05.14 --> 00:31:08.14
Airborne school at Fort Campbell, Kentucky proved more of a challenge.

494
00:31:08.14 --> 00:31:15.14
John endured the verbal abuse and the physical pain, gutting it out until he earned his coveted jump wings at 17 and a half.

495
00:31:15.14 --> 00:31:21.14
The army assigned him immediately to the 11th Airborne Division in Germany.

496
00:31:21.14 --> 00:31:27.14
So that's John Duffy.

497
00:31:27.14 --> 00:31:31.14
That's a pretty cool way to kick things off.

498
00:31:31.14 --> 00:31:35.14
But what's interesting, and you go into this in the book, his first tour is not that big of a deal.

499
00:31:35.14 --> 00:31:39.14
It's in between the Korean War and the Vietnam War. There's not a lot going on.

500
00:31:39.14 --> 00:31:43.14
He does his tour. He decides he's going to get out.

501
00:31:43.14 --> 00:31:47.14
He comes home. He tries a couple of different things. One of them was dancing.

502
00:31:47.14 --> 00:31:51.14
He's not a dancing instructor?

503
00:31:51.14 --> 00:31:55.14
He did not know anything about dancing. He was home. He was out of the army. He was driving around.

504
00:31:55.14 --> 00:31:58.14
There's all kinds of stories of what he was doing driving around.

505
00:31:58.14 --> 00:32:02.14
He passes this Arthur Murray dance studio and it says, dance instructor wanted, I think, the window hiring.

506
00:32:02.14 --> 00:32:07.14
So he walks in and applies for the job and has to scamper around and learn how to dance.

507
00:32:07.14 --> 00:32:11.14
So he can be a dance instructor. He turned into a very good dance instructor.

508
00:32:11.14 --> 00:32:15.14
He still maintains some of that suave nature.

509
00:32:15.14 --> 00:32:23.14
If I can tell a little side story, we had many years ago in San Diego, a Vietnam helicopter pilot's reunion.

510
00:32:23.14 --> 00:32:26.14
I forget how it was a long, long time ago.

511
00:32:26.14 --> 00:32:31.14
John Duffy showed up just because he was in town visiting his brother and he heard about the reunion.

512
00:32:31.14 --> 00:32:36.14
And he showed up. And that's the first time I ever met him face to face and saw him.

513
00:32:36.14 --> 00:32:42.14
I had my young daughter with me. I think she was, I don't know, 13 years old, if that, and my wife.

514
00:32:42.14 --> 00:32:47.14
One of the events for the reunion was a social thing on the midway up on the deck.

515
00:32:47.14 --> 00:32:49.14
And they had a band up there with dancing.

516
00:32:49.14 --> 00:32:54.14
So he gets my young daughter and starts dancing with her on the deck of the midway,

517
00:32:54.14 --> 00:32:58.14
harkening back to his Arthur Murray dance instructor.

518
00:32:58.14 --> 00:33:01.14
And it was beautiful and she loved it.

519
00:33:01.14 --> 00:33:06.14
Okay, fast forward. And I don't want to get too far forward because we'll come to this, I'm sure.

520
00:33:06.14 --> 00:33:09.14
But we were at the White House just a week ago.

521
00:33:09.14 --> 00:33:14.14
And he had just gotten his medal pinned around his neck.

522
00:33:14.14 --> 00:33:19.14
And we were in a social in the, I don't know, the ceremonies in the East Room, one of the other rooms there.

523
00:33:19.14 --> 00:33:22.14
And he got Chelsea and twirled her around like dancing moves up there.

524
00:33:22.14 --> 00:33:26.14
So it was really, really nice and harkened back to that old time memory,

525
00:33:26.14 --> 00:33:34.14
which is just a little further detail on his dance prowess that he got by stepping into an Arthur Murray studio,

526
00:33:34.14 --> 00:33:37.14
knowing nothing about dancing and saying, I just like that job.

527
00:33:37.14 --> 00:33:39.14
And there he goes.

528
00:33:39.14 --> 00:33:41.14
What year was the reunion here in San Diego?

529
00:33:41.14 --> 00:33:46.14
Oh, I'd have to look. I don't know. It was, I mean, if your daughter was 13, then it was like 13 years.

530
00:33:46.14 --> 00:33:48.14
She's 27 now.

531
00:33:48.14 --> 00:33:51.14
So 14 years ago.

532
00:33:51.14 --> 00:33:53.14
And he still got the moves.

533
00:33:53.14 --> 00:33:58.14
Still have the moves and he still has his Brooklyn accent to this day.

534
00:33:58.14 --> 00:34:04.14
Well, following his story where it goes from there after his dance.

535
00:34:04.14 --> 00:34:09.14
I guess he didn't love it too much because he decided he was going to go make his fortune as a gambler.

536
00:34:09.14 --> 00:34:12.14
Now he played cards as a kid. That's early in the book too.

537
00:34:12.14 --> 00:34:16.14
So he really thought he had the stuff he needed to be a winner at card games in Las Vegas.

538
00:34:16.14 --> 00:34:22.14
So he packs up his car and goes to Vegas to go and, you know, I mean, clearly just make a fortune in Vegas.

539
00:34:22.14 --> 00:34:27.14
You know, this is pretty common idea, you know, there's people are giving away money out there.

540
00:34:27.14 --> 00:34:32.14
Well, what two or three months into it, he's completely broke and he has to sell his car.

541
00:34:32.14 --> 00:34:35.14
He's on foot.

542
00:34:35.14 --> 00:34:38.14
Next stop army recruiter.

543
00:34:38.14 --> 00:34:41.14
So he goes back into the army.

544
00:34:41.14 --> 00:34:47.14
And when he goes back in the army still, you know, there's no war going on or anything.

545
00:34:47.14 --> 00:34:53.14
Becomes a finance clerk gets sent to Munich, meets a German woman.

546
00:34:53.14 --> 00:35:00.14
You know, and then he got orders to 10th Special Forces Group and he's assigned to an 18.

547
00:35:00.14 --> 00:35:07.14
Now, when he did that, I tried to figure out was there any school that he was required to go to or how did that work?

548
00:35:07.14 --> 00:35:11.14
No, there was, you know, like today to get into Special Forces and certainly Navy Seals.

549
00:35:11.14 --> 00:35:14.14
I mean, you got to go, yeah, you got to pass buds for the SEALs.

550
00:35:14.14 --> 00:35:15.14
Right.

551
00:35:15.14 --> 00:35:20.14
And in Army Special Forces, you have to go through a school and a lot of guys get weeded out.

552
00:35:20.14 --> 00:35:24.14
No, then he was parachute qualified and had some jumps.

553
00:35:24.14 --> 00:35:26.14
His first tour in Europe was with the Airborne Division.

554
00:35:26.14 --> 00:35:33.14
So he's in Munich, as I remember, doing some clerical nothing job, wanted to get out of there.

555
00:35:33.14 --> 00:35:38.14
And so he volunteered to go down to Bad Tolz with the Special Forces down there.

556
00:35:38.14 --> 00:35:45.14
And he had before he could wear a beret, he had to go through qualification in a whole bunch of just local schools.

557
00:35:45.14 --> 00:35:47.14
But it was nothing like what they have today.

558
00:35:47.14 --> 00:35:55.14
And once he gained certain qualifications and he was able to get his badge and wear his beret.

559
00:35:55.14 --> 00:36:00.14
Yeah, that's that was pretty awesome to read through that.

560
00:36:00.14 --> 00:36:05.14
So he's becomes a demolition guy at an A team.

561
00:36:05.14 --> 00:36:07.14
He gets recommended for OCS.

562
00:36:07.14 --> 00:36:11.14
And then he breaks his arm three, what is it, two, three times?

563
00:36:11.14 --> 00:36:12.14
Three times.

564
00:36:12.14 --> 00:36:13.14
Same arm.

565
00:36:13.14 --> 00:36:16.14
He keeps breaking his arm.

566
00:36:16.14 --> 00:36:20.14
Eventually, he heals up his arm.

567
00:36:20.14 --> 00:36:21.14
He goes to OCS.

568
00:36:21.14 --> 00:36:24.14
He graduates September 11th, 1963.

569
00:36:24.14 --> 00:36:26.14
He's now got two kids.

570
00:36:26.14 --> 00:36:35.14
Once he graduates from OCS, he gets assigned to the 800 first military intelligence detachment in Fort Bragg.

571
00:36:35.14 --> 00:36:37.14
He's not loving this.

572
00:36:37.14 --> 00:36:38.14
No.

573
00:36:38.14 --> 00:36:47.14
And this is back when if you were in Special Forces, or in like any special operations, that wasn't a good career move.

574
00:36:47.14 --> 00:36:50.14
You know, it's not like now where it can be very good for your career.

575
00:36:50.14 --> 00:36:55.14
If you're in the Army or if you're in the Navy, if you're in special operations, it can be back in these days.

576
00:36:55.14 --> 00:36:57.14
It was not good for your career.

577
00:36:57.14 --> 00:37:02.14
And the officers that were looking out for you would actually say, hey, you don't want to keep doing this special operation stuff.

578
00:37:02.14 --> 00:37:04.14
That's not that's not going to get you anywhere.

579
00:37:04.14 --> 00:37:06.14
So they give him this other assignment.

580
00:37:06.14 --> 00:37:08.14
He can't stand it.

581
00:37:08.14 --> 00:37:09.14
Right.

582
00:37:09.14 --> 00:37:19.14
And eventually he's he's wants to go to Vietnam and he gets orders back to Special Forces and he gets assigned to fifth Special Forces.

583
00:37:19.14 --> 00:37:21.14
Fifth Special Forces in Vietnam.

584
00:37:21.14 --> 00:37:27.14
He sent a case on and then he sent to to what is it?

585
00:37:27.14 --> 00:37:28.14
Long way.

586
00:37:28.14 --> 00:37:36.14
Long way gets sent to Long Bay where he's going to be working with the Montiards, the the the brew tribesmen.

587
00:37:36.14 --> 00:37:38.14
And this is where he gets his first combat.

588
00:37:38.14 --> 00:37:40.14
So he's actually been in the Army for a long time.

589
00:37:40.14 --> 00:37:41.14
Yes.

590
00:37:41.14 --> 00:37:44.14
And he but this is where he gets his first combat.

591
00:37:44.14 --> 00:37:51.14
And since we covered May's first combat, let's jump on let's jump on Duffy's first combat going back to the book.

592
00:37:51.14 --> 00:37:55.14
The choppers hovered a few feet above the ground.

593
00:37:55.14 --> 00:37:58.14
The brew fighters and their special forces advisors jumped off.

594
00:37:58.14 --> 00:38:01.14
The helicopters climbed quickly departing to the east.

595
00:38:01.14 --> 00:38:03.14
The rotor noise faded.

596
00:38:03.14 --> 00:38:04.14
All stood in silence.

597
00:38:04.14 --> 00:38:07.14
Duffy stayed close to the brew commander.

598
00:38:07.14 --> 00:38:10.14
They moved off the landing zone and set out.

599
00:38:10.14 --> 00:38:18.14
They scoured the immediate area before beginning a three day sweep northward back to their camp at Lang Vey.

600
00:38:18.14 --> 00:38:23.14
They had no encounters the first day but the next morning they walked into a Viet Cong ambush.

601
00:38:23.14 --> 00:38:25.14
Ratatat and enemy fire.

602
00:38:25.14 --> 00:38:28.14
The brew militia leaders shouted orders.

603
00:38:28.14 --> 00:38:31.14
The commander turned to Duffy pointing to his left front.

604
00:38:31.14 --> 00:38:32.14
VC, 10 o'clock.

605
00:38:32.14 --> 00:38:33.14
Maybe platoon.

606
00:38:33.14 --> 00:38:34.14
Maybe more.

607
00:38:34.14 --> 00:38:37.14
The indige force spread out and returned fire.

608
00:38:37.14 --> 00:38:39.14
The noise of the firefight intensified.

609
00:38:39.14 --> 00:38:41.14
Bullets zipped past John.

610
00:38:41.14 --> 00:38:42.14
Men dropped.

611
00:38:42.14 --> 00:38:43.14
Wounded.

612
00:38:43.14 --> 00:38:44.14
Others fell dead.

613
00:38:44.14 --> 00:38:48.14
A hand grenade landed nearby shrapnel tearing into Duffy's left knee.

614
00:38:48.14 --> 00:38:51.14
A wound that would reward him his first purple heart.

615
00:38:51.14 --> 00:38:53.14
Another grenade rolled between his feet.

616
00:38:53.14 --> 00:38:55.14
He held his breath.

617
00:38:55.14 --> 00:38:57.14
Oh Christ I'm dead.

618
00:38:57.14 --> 00:38:59.14
It didn't detonate.

619
00:38:59.14 --> 00:39:00.14
His heart pounded.

620
00:39:00.14 --> 00:39:02.14
He took a moment to bandage his wounded knee.

621
00:39:02.14 --> 00:39:05.14
Then a calm settled over him.

622
00:39:05.14 --> 00:39:10.14
He began to methodically appraise the situation to try and make sense of what the enemy was doing

623
00:39:10.14 --> 00:39:15.14
to consider the tactics of his fighters to assess the progress of the battle.

624
00:39:15.14 --> 00:39:19.14
He turned to the brew commander and firmly directed counterattack.

625
00:39:19.14 --> 00:39:21.14
Counterattack now.

626
00:39:21.14 --> 00:39:27.14
In the face of the brew advance the Viet Cong withdrew dragging their wounded with them.

627
00:39:27.14 --> 00:39:33.14
Duffy's voice followed the blood trail for a while.

628
00:39:33.14 --> 00:39:35.14
But their foe had escaped.

629
00:39:35.14 --> 00:39:37.14
They resumed the sweep northward.

630
00:39:37.14 --> 00:39:39.14
No further enemy contact.

631
00:39:39.14 --> 00:39:42.14
John Duffy had seen his first combat.

632
00:39:42.14 --> 00:39:45.14
He'd reacted as he hoped he would.

633
00:39:45.14 --> 00:39:47.14
Done what he was trained to do.

634
00:39:47.14 --> 00:39:49.14
Kept his wits about him.

635
00:39:49.14 --> 00:39:50.14
He reflected.

636
00:39:50.14 --> 00:39:51.14
Scary.

637
00:39:51.14 --> 00:39:53.14
But better than expected.

638
00:39:53.14 --> 00:39:55.14
This is my destiny.

639
00:39:57.14 --> 00:40:01.14
So there's his first combat situation that he goes into.

640
00:40:01.14 --> 00:40:03.14
Gets wounded.

641
00:40:03.14 --> 00:40:05.14
Gets hit with a grenade.

642
00:40:05.14 --> 00:40:07.14
Has a grenade done.

643
00:40:07.14 --> 00:40:09.14
Lamp between his legs which is a nightmare.

644
00:40:09.14 --> 00:40:12.14
And he knows that he is a lucky man.

645
00:40:12.14 --> 00:40:14.14
That was his first purple heart.

646
00:40:14.14 --> 00:40:17.14
He has eight purple hearts.

647
00:40:17.14 --> 00:40:20.14
All the way up through fire base Charlie.

648
00:40:20.14 --> 00:40:31.14
This was another situation that you talk about in the book that definitely needs to be covered here.

649
00:40:31.14 --> 00:40:40.14
It says on March 2, 1967, a clear day two silver jets screamed down Route 9 flying low from the east.

650
00:40:40.14 --> 00:40:43.14
Many in the special forces camp waved.

651
00:40:43.14 --> 00:40:49.14
The jets popped up, turned and dropped bombs on Langvay Village.

652
00:40:49.14 --> 00:40:51.14
With some hitting the special forces camp.

653
00:40:51.14 --> 00:40:53.14
Radio calls went out in vain.

654
00:40:53.14 --> 00:40:55.14
No contact with the jets.

655
00:40:55.14 --> 00:40:57.14
They returned for another pass.

656
00:40:57.14 --> 00:41:00.14
This time with 20 millimeter cannons blazing.

657
00:41:00.14 --> 00:41:03.14
The camp opened fire thinking the jets are hostile.

658
00:41:03.14 --> 00:41:04.14
They weren't.

659
00:41:04.14 --> 00:41:05.14
They were American.

660
00:41:05.14 --> 00:41:07.14
They'd made a mistake.

661
00:41:07.14 --> 00:41:11.14
It was possibly the worst friendly fire incident of the war.

662
00:41:11.14 --> 00:41:16.14
Killing 112 brew villagers and wounding 213.

663
00:41:16.14 --> 00:41:20.14
Duffy's green berets entered the village.

664
00:41:20.14 --> 00:41:22.14
The devastation appalled them.

665
00:41:22.14 --> 00:41:29.14
They dashed through flame flames and still exploding ordinance to pull injured families from burning structures.

666
00:41:29.14 --> 00:41:31.14
Risking his life time and time again.

667
00:41:31.14 --> 00:41:33.14
Duffy rescued survivors.

668
00:41:33.14 --> 00:41:35.14
Many still hid in underground bunkers.

669
00:41:35.14 --> 00:41:39.14
John and his men crawled into several begging the occupants to leave.

670
00:41:39.14 --> 00:41:40.14
Some did.

671
00:41:40.14 --> 00:41:41.14
Others didn't.

672
00:41:41.14 --> 00:41:44.14
They were so terrorized that they were frozen in place.

673
00:41:44.14 --> 00:41:46.14
John went for the village chief.

674
00:41:46.14 --> 00:41:48.14
When they returned to the first bunker.

675
00:41:48.14 --> 00:41:49.14
It was too late.

676
00:41:49.14 --> 00:41:50.14
Everyone had died.

677
00:41:50.14 --> 00:41:54.14
The flames and smoke had made the air unbreathable.

678
00:41:54.14 --> 00:42:03.14
The Americans treated the wounded while the villagers retrieved their dead team members soon used up most of their medical supplies.

679
00:42:03.14 --> 00:42:08.14
When proper sutures ran out, they turned to safety pins.

680
00:42:08.14 --> 00:42:13.14
The team helped bury the dead and arranged for medical evacuation of the wounded.

681
00:42:13.14 --> 00:42:18.14
Duffy requested help through channels to make amends as much as that might be possible.

682
00:42:18.14 --> 00:42:23.14
Emergency flights brought food, medicine, clothing and building materials.

683
00:42:23.14 --> 00:42:27.14
U.S. Navy Seabees construction engineers showed up with a backhoe.

684
00:42:27.14 --> 00:42:35.14
Together the tribesmen Green Berets and Seabees built a new Langvay village a short distance from the old one.

685
00:42:35.14 --> 00:42:39.14
The brood chief demanded the old village site be abandoned.

686
00:42:39.14 --> 00:42:47.14
He claimed his people saw it as infested with evil spirits because of the terrible fate that had befallen it.

687
00:42:47.14 --> 00:42:55.14
Duffy leveraged circumstances to also have an airstrip built adjacent to the Special Forces camp.

688
00:42:55.14 --> 00:43:05.14
John had commanded A-101 at Langvay for a little over three months when he received orders to be the executive office for A-113.

689
00:43:05.14 --> 00:43:13.14
The much larger Special Forces Mobile Strike Force for all of I-Core, the northernmost tactical region of South Vietnam.

690
00:43:13.14 --> 00:43:18.14
They called it Mike Force, Mike being short in term for Mobile Strike.

691
00:43:18.14 --> 00:43:23.14
So that was a horrible scenario.

692
00:43:23.14 --> 00:43:27.14
It was and that remains a nightmare in John's mind to this day.

693
00:43:27.14 --> 00:43:29.14
He did what he could do.

694
00:43:29.14 --> 00:43:37.14
The jets, and I honestly don't remember now if they were Air Force, Navy or Marine, but the jets thought that that was an enemy village.

695
00:43:37.14 --> 00:43:41.14
And I think they thought it was just across the Laotian border, but it wasn't.

696
00:43:41.14 --> 00:43:46.14
It was Langvay camp and yeah, it was terrible.

697
00:43:46.14 --> 00:43:50.14
John was the commander of that Special Forces Detachment A-101.

698
00:43:50.14 --> 00:43:55.14
Langvay would later get and you may get into one of them, but got overrun twice.

699
00:43:55.14 --> 00:44:05.14
The second time was, gosh, when 1967, I think, and there was a book written about that called Night of the Silver Stars.

700
00:44:05.14 --> 00:44:10.14
And so many of those guys got killed, captured, a few were rescued.

701
00:44:10.14 --> 00:44:18.14
I ended up in prison camp with two, three guys, I think, from the Langvay camp that were captured that second time.

702
00:44:18.14 --> 00:44:20.14
It was overrun.

703
00:44:20.14 --> 00:44:42.14
You go into some of the stuff in the book of what took place during the rest of that deployment, and then his tour of duty ends, that first tour of duty ends January 17th, 1968, just before the 1968 Ted Offensive.

704
00:44:42.14 --> 00:45:00.14
He gets home, you know, like oftentimes happens, he gets home, his family reunion, getting back together with his family wasn't exactly what it should have been, ends up getting divorced.

705
00:45:00.14 --> 00:45:07.14
And he is ready to go back to Vietnam.

706
00:45:07.14 --> 00:45:10.14
And he ends up going back to Vietnam.

707
00:45:10.14 --> 00:45:12.14
He gets assigned to the Phoenix program.

708
00:45:12.14 --> 00:45:13.14
Yes.

709
00:45:13.14 --> 00:45:19.14
And we've had people from the Phoenix program on this podcast before.

710
00:45:19.14 --> 00:45:30.14
The Phoenix program was essentially an assassination program to kill senior Viet Cong leadership and just assassinate them.

711
00:45:30.14 --> 00:45:33.14
It didn't seem like John liked that idea very much.

712
00:45:33.14 --> 00:45:36.14
He did not like it at all.

713
00:45:36.14 --> 00:45:38.14
He claimed two things.

714
00:45:38.14 --> 00:45:42.14
One, he said his Vietnamese language capability wasn't good enough.

715
00:45:42.14 --> 00:45:44.14
But that was just an excuse, I think.

716
00:45:44.14 --> 00:45:47.14
He didn't want anything to do with Phoenix.

717
00:45:47.14 --> 00:45:50.14
He set his sights other places.

718
00:45:50.14 --> 00:45:54.14
And so he pretty much just had heard.

719
00:45:54.14 --> 00:45:57.14
Had he heard about SOG at this point?

720
00:45:57.14 --> 00:46:00.14
Yeah, he had heard about SOG in large.

721
00:46:00.14 --> 00:46:08.14
I mean, he commanded A-101, so Special Forces Experience and SOG missions going into Laos from Vietnam.

722
00:46:08.14 --> 00:46:09.14
He was aware of it.

723
00:46:09.14 --> 00:46:19.14
So he just grabbed his records and headed to SOG headquarters in Saigon to make his case.

724
00:46:19.14 --> 00:46:20.14
Shows up there.

725
00:46:20.14 --> 00:46:23.14
Shows up at the SOG headquarters.

726
00:46:23.14 --> 00:46:31.14
And SOG, I might say, as they, the special operations were running SOG,

727
00:46:31.14 --> 00:46:38.14
thought they had a little covert deal here because SOG stood for in the sign on the street out in front of the building

728
00:46:38.14 --> 00:46:40.14
was Studies and Observations Group.

729
00:46:40.14 --> 00:46:46.14
It was kind of an innocuous means nothing deal and who would know and who would care what went on there.

730
00:46:46.14 --> 00:46:51.14
But in short order, their exploits became, excuse me, somewhat known.

731
00:46:51.14 --> 00:46:56.14
At least that they were doing sneaky, strained stuff probably across the border.

732
00:46:56.14 --> 00:47:00.14
So most everybody when they'd hear SOG would think it's just Special Operations Group.

733
00:47:00.14 --> 00:47:01.14
That's what it was.

734
00:47:01.14 --> 00:47:05.14
So their Studies and Observations Group didn't care it too well.

735
00:47:05.14 --> 00:47:08.14
But yeah, so John found his way to their headquarters building,

736
00:47:08.14 --> 00:47:11.14
which was just a building on a street in Saigon.

737
00:47:11.14 --> 00:47:13.14
It wasn't on a military base at all.

738
00:47:13.14 --> 00:47:19.14
And yeah, went in to make his case that he didn't want to have anything to do with Phoenix and could they help him.

739
00:47:19.14 --> 00:47:24.14
Colonel Eiler, who's one of the SOG commanders,

740
00:47:24.14 --> 00:47:28.14
he says, sat down behind his desk and read through John's military records.

741
00:47:28.14 --> 00:47:29.14
They chatted for a while.

742
00:47:29.14 --> 00:47:31.14
The Colonel made a phone call.

743
00:47:31.14 --> 00:47:34.14
He leaned back in his chair and said, you're no longer assigned to the Phoenix program.

744
00:47:34.14 --> 00:47:36.14
You're now a member of SOG.

745
00:47:36.14 --> 00:47:37.14
Welcome aboard.

746
00:47:37.14 --> 00:47:45.14
I want you to cut off all the insignia from your uniforms and report back here at 0700 tomorrow morning with all your stuff.

747
00:47:45.14 --> 00:47:48.14
Duffy responded with a loud yes, sir.

748
00:47:48.14 --> 00:47:53.14
He gets an in brief.

749
00:47:53.14 --> 00:47:56.14
We run MacV Sog missions onto the trail.

750
00:47:56.14 --> 00:48:00.14
Same as the launch sites in South Vietnam, but we are weather backup.

751
00:48:00.14 --> 00:48:05.14
When things are too scoched on that side, we insert and recover teams from here.

752
00:48:05.14 --> 00:48:10.14
SOG teams out of Vietnam are normally three U.S. and eight to 10 indigenous.

753
00:48:10.14 --> 00:48:16.14
Most of that we work with our two U.S. and four indige because the helicopter limitations.

754
00:48:16.14 --> 00:48:18.14
John asked, what exactly do we do?

755
00:48:18.14 --> 00:48:28.14
Mostly reconnaissance behind enemy lines, watching the trail, gathering intel and sometimes directing airstrikes on enemy convoys or fuel and supply depots.

756
00:48:28.14 --> 00:48:32.14
They'll tap into communications lines when they find them.

757
00:48:32.14 --> 00:48:35.14
They also conduct ground raids to destroy supplies and equipment.

758
00:48:35.14 --> 00:48:39.14
They'll mine roads on occasion and snatch prisoners too.

759
00:48:39.14 --> 00:48:42.14
He looked right at John, all highly classified.

760
00:48:42.14 --> 00:48:43.14
We don't exist.

761
00:48:43.14 --> 00:48:44.14
We're not here.

762
00:48:44.14 --> 00:48:46.14
His expression tightened.

763
00:48:46.14 --> 00:48:47.14
It's dicey.

764
00:48:47.14 --> 00:48:51.14
We've lost a number of teams.

765
00:48:51.14 --> 00:48:53.14
He turned and motion to John.

766
00:48:53.14 --> 00:48:55.14
Let's go meet the commander and get you settled in.

767
00:48:55.14 --> 00:49:03.14
Major Bill Shetland, the MLT-3 commander made Captain Duffy his executive officer overseeing operations and intelligence activities.

768
00:49:03.14 --> 00:49:09.14
At the same time, Duffy functioned as a launch officer responsible for coordinating individual SOG team missions.

769
00:49:09.14 --> 00:49:14.14
He also routinely flew in the OV-10 Broncos as a backseat SOG observer.

770
00:49:14.14 --> 00:49:20.14
The front seat US Air Force pilots were all qualified forward air controllers or fax.

771
00:49:20.14 --> 00:49:34.14
The aircraft provided an immediate available overhead capability to synchronize support in real time as a team conducted its assigned mission deep in enemy held territory.

772
00:49:34.14 --> 00:49:40.14
So, yeah, we've had quite a few SOG guys on here.

773
00:49:40.14 --> 00:49:43.14
So he's up basically flying Covey, right?

774
00:49:43.14 --> 00:49:47.14
Yeah, they called the guys that flew in the aircraft Covey riders.

775
00:49:47.14 --> 00:49:53.14
They were SOG qualified guys, special forces guys could really appreciate and relate to the mission.

776
00:49:53.14 --> 00:49:57.14
And from the air, they would coordinate all support.

777
00:49:57.14 --> 00:50:04.14
As that said, the front seat Air Force pilot of the OV-10 was qualified as a fax forward air controller.

778
00:50:04.14 --> 00:50:11.14
But in time, the backseat Covey riders could do as much adjustment of air as that front seat.

779
00:50:11.14 --> 00:50:16.14
I might comment, there was a time a few years ago where I couldn't have put those sentences in that book.

780
00:50:16.14 --> 00:50:20.14
It was still sensitive, highly classified information.

781
00:50:20.14 --> 00:50:28.14
And it goes to another former SOG guy who wrote some books and the first book I think that really got this information out in the open.

782
00:50:28.14 --> 00:50:33.14
His name is John Plaster, and he wrote a book called SOG America's Secret Commandos.

783
00:50:33.14 --> 00:50:37.14
And he coordinated and cleared to get that information out.

784
00:50:37.14 --> 00:50:42.14
But until then, even the involvement I had in my mission before I was shot down and captured supporting SOG,

785
00:50:42.14 --> 00:50:45.14
I couldn't people say, what'd you do in the great Vietnam war as well?

786
00:50:45.14 --> 00:50:50.14
And I was in gunships, and that's about all I can talk about. So John Plaster got this all out in the open,

787
00:50:50.14 --> 00:50:55.14
so we could give that level of detail of what John Duffy was doing.

788
00:50:55.14 --> 00:51:00.14
And I don't know if we mentioned Mobile Launch Team 3 was out of Nong Khong Phnom, Thailand.

789
00:51:00.14 --> 00:51:05.14
So this part of SOG was on the west side of Laos.

790
00:51:05.14 --> 00:51:09.14
Most of their operations ran from forward operating bases or FOBS inside of Vietnam.

791
00:51:09.14 --> 00:51:14.14
There were three of them that would launch the teams into Laos and recover back into Vietnam.

792
00:51:14.14 --> 00:51:21.14
But if the weather was ghost, then all the weight went on Mobile Launch Team 3 and Nong Khong Phnom to come in from the Thailand side.

793
00:51:21.14 --> 00:51:29.14
Yeah, it's crazy. I think it was a 20-year waiting period that they had on the SOG mission,

794
00:51:29.14 --> 00:51:38.14
so nothing was said about it until like 1995 or 1994 before anyone even broached the subject.

795
00:51:38.14 --> 00:51:45.14
We've had John Striker Myron here a few times. I know he wrote a couple articles early for like Soldier of Fortune magazine

796
00:51:45.14 --> 00:51:54.14
or something and started getting the word out about the insane and heroic operations that the guys at SOG did.

797
00:51:54.14 --> 00:51:57.14
Yeah, just crazy.

798
00:51:57.14 --> 00:52:00.14
So John Duffy was flying Covey Rider on that second tour of duty,

799
00:52:00.14 --> 00:52:04.14
in addition to being the launch officer and all the other admin responsibilities in the unit,

800
00:52:04.14 --> 00:52:11.14
but he spent a lot of time in OB-10s out over the trail, supporting those guys on the ground.

801
00:52:11.14 --> 00:52:18.14
Yeah, and he clearly, which we'll see, he got extremely good at understanding how to utilize air support.

802
00:52:18.14 --> 00:52:23.14
No doubt about it. He received five air medals for Valor during the missions.

803
00:52:23.14 --> 00:52:26.14
He flew there following a year of challenging and rewarding services.

804
00:52:26.14 --> 00:52:29.14
Second combat tour ended. He got orders back to the United States.

805
00:52:29.14 --> 00:52:41.14
So that ends John Duffy's tour. Meanwhile, May, Levant May, is also continuing to get more and more combat experience,

806
00:52:41.14 --> 00:52:49.14
especially now where after Tet of 1968, he fought in Quezon, he fought in the A'shaw Valley.

807
00:52:49.14 --> 00:52:58.14
He was in the field fighting when he got radio traffic that he was, that he had a son.

808
00:52:58.14 --> 00:53:11.14
He was part of Lamsan 719, the largest helicopter assault the war, which we covered on podcasts 294 with a Huey pilot JTate.

809
00:53:11.14 --> 00:53:18.14
And what Van May did on that, he was held in reserve.

810
00:53:18.14 --> 00:53:26.14
So there was a bunch of Vietnamese troops that went in into Cambodia and he was in reserve.

811
00:53:26.14 --> 00:53:29.14
So that unit was in reserve. So they didn't go in.

812
00:53:29.14 --> 00:53:32.14
And into Laos. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 719.

813
00:53:32.14 --> 00:53:38.14
And yeah, he was part of the second brigade and they were supposed to be the final,

814
00:53:38.14 --> 00:53:42.14
and they were going to do an airborne or air mobile assault at the town of Chapon,

815
00:53:42.14 --> 00:53:46.14
which was the end of this attack into Laos.

816
00:53:46.14 --> 00:53:51.14
But for some reason, his mission got changed and he never did that.

817
00:53:51.14 --> 00:53:57.14
I think the president of Vietnam got a little bit cold feet and decided to withdraw earlier than anticipated.

818
00:53:57.14 --> 00:53:59.14
Of course, that withdrawal turned into a route.

819
00:53:59.14 --> 00:54:05.14
They had some ground forces in there, some Rangers trying to hold some outposts on either side of the advance,

820
00:54:05.14 --> 00:54:07.14
and that turned into a mess.

821
00:54:07.14 --> 00:54:13.14
But yeah, May's unit never got deployed across the border on Lamsan 719, was held in reserve.

822
00:54:13.14 --> 00:54:20.14
The only action they saw was when the Vietnamese forces were coming back across the border, they facilitated that crossing.

823
00:54:20.14 --> 00:54:28.14
And meanwhile, while that's happening, John Duffy, he wants to get back to Vietnam, of course, again.

824
00:54:28.14 --> 00:54:32.14
He can't get orders. He's trying to get orders.

825
00:54:32.14 --> 00:54:35.14
And finally, he volunteers to go back to Sog.

826
00:54:35.14 --> 00:54:39.14
And he's thinking, hey, you know what? Great. I'll go back to Sog.

827
00:54:39.14 --> 00:54:41.14
I'll get some more combat experience.

828
00:54:41.14 --> 00:54:46.14
Well, when he gets back to Sog, he gets told you're too senior for anything in the field.

829
00:54:46.14 --> 00:54:49.14
So you're basically going to be riding a desk.

830
00:54:49.14 --> 00:54:53.14
He doesn't like that. He didn't like being in a combat zone with no combat.

831
00:54:53.14 --> 00:54:57.14
That's how you put it in the book.

832
00:54:57.14 --> 00:55:07.14
He spends four months there at Sog headquarters, and then he asks to get reassigned to MACV's Team 162,

833
00:55:07.14 --> 00:55:11.14
which was a team that worked directly with the Vietnamese airborne units.

834
00:55:11.14 --> 00:55:19.14
And the colonel that's he's asking to go and get this transfer from tells him you'll be killed.

835
00:55:19.14 --> 00:55:23.14
You ignorant son of a bitch. And Duffy replies, so be it.

836
00:55:23.14 --> 00:55:29.14
John Duffy wanted to get back into combat badly.

837
00:55:29.14 --> 00:55:34.14
He drives to Red Hat Hill. What's the deal with Red Hat Hill?

838
00:55:34.14 --> 00:55:41.14
Red Hat Hill is an army of the Republic of Vietnam airborne base on the edge of Saigon,

839
00:55:41.14 --> 00:55:45.14
northeast of the downtown city of Saigon.

840
00:55:45.14 --> 00:55:53.14
And that was a it was the base for the 11th Airborne Battalion and a small advisory group.

841
00:55:53.14 --> 00:55:56.14
And they trained there. Their barracks were there.

842
00:55:56.14 --> 00:55:59.14
And it was from there that they would deploy to their combat operations.

843
00:55:59.14 --> 00:56:10.14
And again, close enough May's family was in Saigon, so it was close enough that he could again drive home every night and spend time at home and then go back to work in the morning.

844
00:56:10.14 --> 00:56:16.14
He gets up there where he's going to become an advisor and the battalion commanders having a weekly meeting.

845
00:56:16.14 --> 00:56:19.14
And I'm going to go to the book for when he shows up.

846
00:56:19.14 --> 00:56:25.14
This weekly meeting is happening as business wrapped up the six foot three strapping Americans strode through the door.

847
00:56:25.14 --> 00:56:28.14
His look intense his movement deliberate.

848
00:56:28.14 --> 00:56:34.14
He wore a brand new camouflage pattern airborne uniform and the red Vietnamese beret.

849
00:56:34.14 --> 00:56:39.14
He scanned the room and spotted the ranking officer Colonel bow.

850
00:56:39.14 --> 00:56:44.14
He walked over to him. The two spoke bow looked over before turning to the group.

851
00:56:44.14 --> 00:56:50.14
This is our new senior advisor Major John Duffy. He is an American Special Forces officer.

852
00:56:50.14 --> 00:56:52.14
All eyes were on John.

853
00:56:52.14 --> 00:56:58.14
After a somewhat awkward pause, bow commented or bow continued. Why don't you tell us about yourself Major Duffy?

854
00:56:58.14 --> 00:57:03.14
John briefly recounted his previous tours in Vietnam highlighting his combat experience.

855
00:57:03.14 --> 00:57:06.14
On concluding, he said, I'm very glad to be here.

856
00:57:06.14 --> 00:57:09.14
His sincerity impressed everyone.

857
00:57:09.14 --> 00:57:14.14
They all greeted him individually and in small groups may just stared for a time.

858
00:57:14.14 --> 00:57:18.14
He was taken with the fact that John was a special that John was special forces.

859
00:57:18.14 --> 00:57:23.14
He knew their work along the border and it heard stories of their covert operations.

860
00:57:23.14 --> 00:57:27.14
He'd seen the John Wayne movie at the Saigon Theater.

861
00:57:27.14 --> 00:57:31.14
The soundtrack tune Barry Sadler's Bawl of the Green Berets played in his head.

862
00:57:31.14 --> 00:57:34.14
Finally, he stepped forward in his very best English.

863
00:57:34.14 --> 00:57:38.14
He said, Hello, I'm Major May the XL.

864
00:57:38.14 --> 00:57:44.14
John looked at him smiled and said in his best Vietnamese. I'm Major John Duffy.

865
00:57:44.14 --> 00:57:46.14
I look forward to working with you.

866
00:57:46.14 --> 00:57:50.14
May smiled broadly. He wanted to learn all he could from this American.

867
00:57:50.14 --> 00:57:57.14
As senior advisor protocol dictated that John would work principally with the commander, Lieutenant Colonel Bough.

868
00:57:57.14 --> 00:58:02.14
Normally, his contact with the executive officer may would be minimal.

869
00:58:02.14 --> 00:58:08.14
The XO was to pair with an assistant advisor, but from the outset, this was no normal relationship.

870
00:58:08.14 --> 00:58:11.14
There was no assistant advisor. John was it.

871
00:58:11.14 --> 00:58:16.14
Personnel shortages dictated filling the three man team with only one person.

872
00:58:16.14 --> 00:58:24.14
From the outset, the strapping American intrigued May and John Duffy saw something in May that immediately impressed him.

873
00:58:24.14 --> 00:58:31.14
Thereafter, May took every opportunity to talk to John during breaks and training and after unit meetings.

874
00:58:31.14 --> 00:58:38.14
May drew from John's Green Beret experience while John learned all he could about arvin procedures

875
00:58:38.14 --> 00:58:45.14
and, most importantly, getting a better understanding of Vietnamese culture.

876
00:58:45.14 --> 00:58:49.14
Pretty cool introduction. Those guys, they kind of hit it off out of the gate.

877
00:58:49.14 --> 00:58:52.14
Yep, right. Immediately.

878
00:58:52.14 --> 00:58:57.14
Not long after that, they start operating. They start doing missions.

879
00:58:57.14 --> 00:59:02.14
Going to the book here. At dawn on October 5, 1971, the North Vietnamese attacked in earnest.

880
00:59:02.14 --> 00:59:08.14
A force of over a thousand soldiers hit the battalion hard. Enemy mortars and rockets pounded them.

881
00:59:08.14 --> 00:59:15.14
John woke with a start. Officers and sergeants shouted command, bringing a disciplined response to the madness around them.

882
00:59:15.14 --> 00:59:20.14
John made his way to Bao. Hai was already there. Who's Hai? The operations officer?

883
00:59:20.14 --> 00:59:22.14
Hai is the operations officer, the battalion S3.

884
00:59:22.14 --> 00:59:25.14
So Bao is the commander. Hai is the operations officer.

885
00:59:25.14 --> 00:59:30.14
May ran up in an instant. Bao calmly passed orders through the radio operator.

886
00:59:30.14 --> 00:59:38.14
Seeing his team assembled, he said, Ground Attack, come for sure. Hai, get us VNAF, Vietnamese Air Force.

887
00:59:38.14 --> 00:59:40.14
VNAF, yeah, any one Sky Raiders?

888
00:59:40.14 --> 00:59:46.14
Put artillery all around perimeter. May, go to companies. Coordinate counterattack. Duffy, how about air strikes?

889
00:59:46.14 --> 00:59:54.14
Quick and real close. Bao went on in Vietnamese for a moment, providing more detail to his operations officer and ex-o.

890
00:59:54.14 --> 01:00:03.14
The sound of bugles and whistles and screams filled the air. Small arms fire intensified. The ground attack had begun.

891
01:00:03.14 --> 01:00:10.14
Go, Bao commanded. They each set about their tasks. John moved a short distance away to a protected spot and got on his radio,

892
01:00:10.14 --> 01:00:16.14
attempting to contact American forward air controller, who was airborne in a small propeller-driven spotter plane.

893
01:00:16.14 --> 01:00:24.14
Any FAC, any FAC, this is Dusty Cyanide, advisor with Vietnamese Airborne Battalion, under attack. Need air badly.

894
01:00:24.14 --> 01:00:31.14
Any FAC, any FAC, station calling for FAC, this is Chico 1-2. Roger 1-2, this is Dusty Cyanide,

895
01:00:31.14 --> 01:00:38.14
been receiving heavy incoming ground attack underway, multiple enemy battalions, holding as best we can, but need air.

896
01:00:38.14 --> 01:00:45.14
Understood, Dusty, we'll have fighters for you shortly. What are the friendly locations and where are the enemy targets?

897
01:00:45.14 --> 01:00:51.14
John passed the details for the strike to the forward air controller. Bao approached. As they discussed options for the battle,

898
01:00:51.14 --> 01:00:59.14
a rocket blast hit them with the full fury of a shrapnel. Fragments peppered the left side of John's face and tore into Bao's right eye.

899
01:00:59.14 --> 01:01:07.14
It looked bad, blackened and bloody. They wiped their wounds and continued the fight. Bao headed toward the sound of the most intense fighting.

900
01:01:07.14 --> 01:01:14.14
Duffy looked around and saw several critically wounded nearby. Dismissing his own injuries, he left his protected position,

901
01:01:14.14 --> 01:01:21.14
exposing himself to enemy fire so he could render first aid. He saw the battalion surgeon, Dr. Liu.

902
01:01:21.14 --> 01:01:23.14
Is that right, Liu?

903
01:01:23.14 --> 01:01:24.14
Dr. Liu.

904
01:01:24.14 --> 01:01:31.14
Dr. Liu doing the same. His uniform torn and dirty. His body bloodied from his own wounds. Once the jet fighters arrived,

905
01:01:31.14 --> 01:01:38.14
John moved about wherever necessary to best direct air strikes, remaining calm and focused, oblivious to the bullets flying around him.

906
01:01:38.14 --> 01:01:46.14
That day, John Duffy put in more than 40 flights of fighter aircraft. Those air strikes on top of the courageous fighting of the paratroopers

907
01:01:46.14 --> 01:01:54.14
saved the battalion from being overrun. May led a successful counterattack with one 14 company in the lead.

908
01:01:54.14 --> 01:02:04.14
In the midst of the fray, Duffy found time to supervise cutting a landing zone so that VNAF Medevac helicopters could get in to pick up the wounded.

909
01:02:04.14 --> 01:02:16.14
The NVA killed 10 11th battalion paratroopers and wounded 74. When it was all over, Duffy, Bao, May, and Hai stood facing each other,

910
01:02:16.14 --> 01:02:22.14
their uniforms soiled with dirt and blood, their faces smudged with filth, their eyes red from exhaustion.

911
01:02:22.14 --> 01:02:29.14
Bao studied his team, smiled, and nodded in appreciation. May looked at the intensity on John Duffy's face.

912
01:02:29.14 --> 01:02:36.14
John returned his glance, softened his expression, and gave his friend a knowing wink.

913
01:02:36.14 --> 01:02:42.14
These guys are in it.

914
01:02:42.14 --> 01:02:52.14
Yeah, that was the end of one hellacious battle for those guys. And Bao's eye injury, he lost his eye in that battle.

915
01:02:52.14 --> 01:02:58.14
Would not be Medevac continued to fight with those guys. It was quite something.

916
01:02:58.14 --> 01:03:04.14
Yeah, look, I apologize. I kind of jumped towards the end of that battle. There's a whole scene running up to that.

917
01:03:04.14 --> 01:03:07.14
We can't read the whole book.

918
01:03:07.14 --> 01:03:12.14
Exactly. When you want the rest of those details, get the book.

919
01:03:12.14 --> 01:03:24.14
You go over more operations, you detail them, the bonds between these guys strengthen. They really become real true comrades.

920
01:03:24.14 --> 01:03:32.14
And then my fast forward a little bit. The 11th Airborne Battalion headed to Khantum on March 31, 1972.

921
01:03:32.14 --> 01:03:41.14
Conditions there grew more intense each day. For months, intelligence reports had warned of North Vietnamese preparations for a major attack.

922
01:03:41.14 --> 01:03:49.14
Two Cobra gunships from the US Army's 361st Aerial Weapons Company spotted enemy tanks in late January.

923
01:03:49.14 --> 01:03:54.14
Subsequent sightings by other American helicopters and the Vietnamese Air Force followed.

924
01:03:54.14 --> 01:03:59.14
Arvin ground patrols encountered even larger NVA units as the weeks progressed.

925
01:03:59.14 --> 01:04:09.14
Prisoners and documents seized in February confirmed the presence of 10 to 20,000 NVA soldiers along with tanks, artillery,

926
01:04:09.14 --> 01:04:20.14
and large numbers of anti-aircraft weapons all poised in the tri-border area of western Khantum province.

927
01:04:20.14 --> 01:04:23.14
Something bad is about to happen.

928
01:04:23.14 --> 01:04:31.14
You know, it's interesting. This is going to turn into or turn out to be the 1972 Easter offensive.

929
01:04:31.14 --> 01:04:40.14
This is March 31st of 1972. Nobody had a clue.

930
01:04:40.14 --> 01:04:46.14
I mean, we knew that the enemy was up to something and in our support of the SOG guys out there, they had seen stuff going on.

931
01:04:46.14 --> 01:04:55.14
But it is all about to come to a crescendo here in the Central Highlands as well as, well, the Easter offensive began.

932
01:04:55.14 --> 01:05:02.14
And I think we'll get to that with an invasion across the demilitarized zone in the north and I-Corps, the northern area of South Vietnam,

933
01:05:02.14 --> 01:05:12.14
out of Cambodia towards Saigon, trying to thrust a Saigon, and then out of Laos and Cambodia into Khantum province into the Central Highlands.

934
01:05:12.14 --> 01:05:21.14
And we're going to soon find ourselves right in the middle of the largest enemy offensive of the war while Americans were still there.

935
01:05:21.14 --> 01:05:30.14
Now most, well, most people don't know anything about the Vietnam War anyway, but most who know something about the Vietnam War will tell you that the largest offensive was Tet of 68.

936
01:05:30.14 --> 01:05:39.14
That certainly gets the most notoriety. In the spring of 1972, most American ground forces were gone. We were withdrawing from the war.

937
01:05:39.14 --> 01:05:48.14
So the Easter offensive doesn't get quite the notoriety, but it was a significantly larger enemy operation than the Tet offensive of 68.

938
01:05:48.14 --> 01:05:56.14
And this marked a watershed change. The war was no longer a guerrilla war with the Easter offensive of 72.

939
01:05:56.14 --> 01:06:02.14
It was a conventional war. North Vietnam sent every division they had save one that they kept in the north.

940
01:06:02.14 --> 01:06:13.14
Every other division came south and it was regular infantry, armor, tanks, air defense all over the place. And it was something.

941
01:06:13.14 --> 01:06:19.14
What did this seem like from your perspective at the time on the ground?

942
01:06:19.14 --> 01:06:26.14
You're what? How old are you at this point 25 something like 20 by the Easter offensive? I was 26.

943
01:06:26.14 --> 01:06:34.14
I went to Vietnam on my second tour at 25 had a birthday in late December. So I was a young 26 year old army captain.

944
01:06:34.14 --> 01:06:39.14
So obviously now you know you look back and you see this big strategic picture.

945
01:06:39.14 --> 01:06:46.14
What did it look like for you on the ground when you're 26 years old and you're a friggin helicopter gunslinger?

946
01:06:46.14 --> 01:06:53.14
Yeah, well, we were just flying missions, you know, and the missions up until then we're supporting the Macbysauk operations.

947
01:06:53.14 --> 01:07:05.14
And those were just full of excitement too, because with the enemy buildup that we were just beginning to have an appreciation for those teams most often.

948
01:07:05.14 --> 01:07:12.14
I don't want to overstate it, but I think I can say most often after we put them in their extractions were a tacky, tactile emergency,

949
01:07:12.14 --> 01:07:18.14
because they had made contact with the enemy and the enemy had discovered them and was in hot pursuit.

950
01:07:18.14 --> 01:07:25.14
And they were very exciting extractions with us firing Cobra weapons very, very close for their extraction.

951
01:07:25.14 --> 01:07:31.14
And even their missions inside of South Vietnam now, which as I said earlier was primarily what they were doing.

952
01:07:31.14 --> 01:07:37.14
Still, the enemy was in growing strength, so every one of their missions was pretty dicey.

953
01:07:37.14 --> 01:07:44.14
Yeah, so what was it? I don't know, what is it for a 26 year old? I mean, you've been there too as a young guy off in combat.

954
01:07:44.14 --> 01:07:53.14
Yeah, you're getting shot at, aircraft are taking hits. It's exciting for the guys on the ground trying to get them out of there.

955
01:07:53.14 --> 01:07:59.14
There's some fear on the missions. I mean, you'd be crazy if you're not afraid when you're in the middle of combat,

956
01:07:59.14 --> 01:08:04.14
but you're doing what you're trained to do, so you focus on that and you get through it.

957
01:08:04.14 --> 01:08:11.14
And for aviators, luckily at the end of the day, we get to fly back to the air base and get out of our helicopter and go to our little officers club

958
01:08:11.14 --> 01:08:16.14
and start throwing down some drinks to get ready to do the same thing the next day.

959
01:08:16.14 --> 01:08:21.14
We didn't really appreciate what this buildup signified.

960
01:08:21.14 --> 01:08:30.14
We were seeing more action, we're seeing more enemy activity, and so we shifted from support for the McVease SOG guys out of FOB 2

961
01:08:30.14 --> 01:08:37.14
to just kind of a general fire brigade in the Central Highlands, and so it was turning into every day we'd launch in the morning,

962
01:08:37.14 --> 01:08:48.14
really not knowing exactly what was happening, but we get calls for support and we go provide gun support, rearm, refuel, go back out and spend the days doing that.

963
01:08:48.14 --> 01:08:56.14
I guess there was some level of worry even for a 26-year-old that started to mount because then we started to have an aircraft shot down.

964
01:08:56.14 --> 01:09:06.14
We had an OH-58 shot down and the pilot was missing in action, assumed captured, and so there was all that to be concerned about,

965
01:09:06.14 --> 01:09:10.14
but that comes back to the attitude that young people have.

966
01:09:10.14 --> 01:09:17.14
I realized that things were happening, that things were building up, that people were getting hurt, and aircraft were getting going down,

967
01:09:17.14 --> 01:09:27.14
but I never for a minute thought that any of that would happen to me because there's something in our mind, in our psyche, particularly for combat guys,

968
01:09:27.14 --> 01:09:38.14
that bad stuff happens but it's happening to someone else. It's not going to happen to me, and that's how you strap into the helicopter every day and go back out and do the same thing again.

969
01:09:38.14 --> 01:09:41.14
Now you got shot down in your first deployment to Vietnam.

970
01:09:41.14 --> 01:09:42.14
I did.

971
01:09:42.14 --> 01:09:50.14
And you survived obviously and you evaded the enemy and you got picked up. Do you think that bolstered your confidence?

972
01:09:50.14 --> 01:10:01.14
Yeah, I don't know. I don't want to talk too much about my own psychology because after I got back to being a prisoner, we had to have psychological evaluations and stuff,

973
01:10:01.14 --> 01:10:04.14
and the psychiatrists say, well, you know, what are some of the things you enjoy?

974
01:10:04.14 --> 01:10:15.14
Well, you know, I was a forest firefighter and I enjoyed that and I did a little college, rode some rodeo, and I like to ride motorcycles, and the guy, oh, okay, would you have a death?

975
01:10:15.14 --> 01:10:16.14
No, I don't have a death wish.

976
01:10:16.14 --> 01:10:26.14
So yeah, I don't know. There's something about psychological makeup of some people that they do okay in that type of situation.

977
01:10:26.14 --> 01:10:39.14
And, you know, that would come all the way to how I've adjusted since I got back from Vietnam and I go into a lot of that in my first book of the trials and tribulations that I faced and what today would be called PTSD.

978
01:10:39.14 --> 01:10:46.14
But, you know, I got through all of that and I tell some of the ways that I did that and I think I'm semi-finding today.

979
01:10:46.14 --> 01:10:55.14
So, you know, whatever mental mindset got me through those combat operations on that second tour also got me through first tour.

980
01:10:55.14 --> 01:11:02.14
I was shot down over the middle of Laos. I had injuries to my neck. I rode an ejection seat out a very short parachute ride down.

981
01:11:02.14 --> 01:11:09.14
We were crashing through the trees by the time I punched out. So I got a partial suit deployment and I hit the ground.

982
01:11:09.14 --> 01:11:14.14
But as soon as I got picked up and taken to hospital in Thailand, I was in the hospital for a while and then back to the unit.

983
01:11:14.14 --> 01:11:21.14
And as soon as I got back to the unit, I was up reporting to the flight service and said, hey, I got to get back on flight status. I got to go fly.

984
01:11:21.14 --> 01:11:29.14
So, yeah, who knows what's there. But I was enthusiastic to fly my missions on the first tour.

985
01:11:29.14 --> 01:11:36.14
And after a break back to the States and back to Vietnam, I had to fight because the U.S. was drawing so rapidly.

986
01:11:36.14 --> 01:11:41.14
I had to fight at every level to get assigned to a unit still in combat.

987
01:11:41.14 --> 01:11:47.14
Yeah, so maybe there's a little duffie inside of me. I don't know. I wanted to get back into the fight.

988
01:11:47.14 --> 01:11:52.14
Now, as you're seeing this massive buildup, I mean, you're seeing tanks on the ground.

989
01:11:52.14 --> 01:11:53.14
Right.

990
01:11:53.14 --> 01:11:59.14
This has got to change your viewpoint a little bit. It seems like everyone would say, oh, something massive is coming.

991
01:11:59.14 --> 01:12:07.14
Yeah, the massive wasn't there for some reason. Something's coming. I think somewhere in the back of my mind was, well, whatever it is, we'll handle it.

992
01:12:07.14 --> 01:12:13.14
You know, if the enemy comes out of the woods, we got B-52s and all these airstrikes and we'll just annihilate them in place,

993
01:12:13.14 --> 01:12:20.14
similar to what was done up at K-SAN in 1968 when they put K-SAN under siege.

994
01:12:20.14 --> 01:12:24.14
We just bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb and really cause the enemy a lot of damage.

995
01:12:24.14 --> 01:12:33.14
So I think that thought was there. Yeah, there must have been some concern because some of the attacks, the enemy attacked Route 19,

996
01:12:33.14 --> 01:12:36.14
which was between our base at Plague Coup and the coast, and the closed Route 19.

997
01:12:36.14 --> 01:12:38.14
We got involved in a bunch of operations down there.

998
01:12:38.14 --> 01:12:45.14
So we were cut off in the highlands. There was no road transport coming to our base at Camp Holloway near Plague Coup.

999
01:12:45.14 --> 01:12:48.14
All our supplies had to come in and see one-thirties on the runway.

1000
01:12:48.14 --> 01:12:55.14
Engineer crews came in there to improve the PSP runway and make it better.

1001
01:12:55.14 --> 01:12:58.14
There was some talk that that was done because of the situation.

1002
01:12:58.14 --> 01:13:02.14
Got bad enough they'd have to get in and extract us and get us out of there.

1003
01:13:02.14 --> 01:13:09.14
I don't know, somehow we still had our routine of daily go-fly combat missions and come home at night

1004
01:13:09.14 --> 01:13:12.14
and get drunk and get up the next morning and go do it all again.

1005
01:13:12.14 --> 01:13:14.14
How long would you fly for in a day?

1006
01:13:14.14 --> 01:13:21.14
Oh, gosh. I don't know, four or five, six hours.

1007
01:13:21.14 --> 01:13:25.14
But the day was longer because we would take off in the morning

1008
01:13:25.14 --> 01:13:37.14
and if we didn't have a mission right away, we'd go stand by somewhere at Docto or at the FOB pad, the SOG pad.

1009
01:13:37.14 --> 01:13:39.14
So there was a lot of downtime waiting.

1010
01:13:39.14 --> 01:13:41.14
Just waiting? Would you wait in your bird?

1011
01:13:41.14 --> 01:13:45.14
Well, we'd wait next to, not sitting in the bird, but next to the bird.

1012
01:13:45.14 --> 01:13:51.14
Sometimes we'd play a little cards, but we'd be right there so we could launch within two minutes.

1013
01:13:51.14 --> 01:13:57.14
That was our routine when we put the SOG teams in too. We'd put the team in, we'd go back to usually Docto

1014
01:13:57.14 --> 01:14:02.14
and we'd just sit there and wait because if the team got in trouble, we had to be immediately available for them.

1015
01:14:02.14 --> 01:14:07.14
So yeah, on any given day there was some downtime just sitting waiting for launch.

1016
01:14:07.14 --> 01:14:13.14
Once the activity started picking up in the Easter offensive though, it was a lot of flying, refueling, flying, refueling.

1017
01:14:13.14 --> 01:14:20.14
If you recall in my first book, by the time we got there, now this is going to be three weeks after the Charlie battle,

1018
01:14:20.14 --> 01:14:25.14
boy, it was all day. I mean, I did three rotations into combat before noon.

1019
01:14:25.14 --> 01:14:32.14
It was on my third rotation into combat that I got shot down and that was before we got to noon.

1020
01:14:32.14 --> 01:14:41.14
Man, yeah, that's wild how it all looks in retrospect, right?

1021
01:14:41.14 --> 01:14:47.14
What this looks like now, as you're looking back, you think, man, they had all these tanks, they're moving in,

1022
01:14:47.14 --> 01:14:51.14
there's thousands and thousands of troops massing.

1023
01:14:51.14 --> 01:14:58.14
It looks crazy now. I mean, I think about it, here I am a 76-year-old man and who would do that? That's nuts.

1024
01:14:58.14 --> 01:15:04.14
And you also wonder, like, are you hearing anything from the strategic leadership?

1025
01:15:04.14 --> 01:15:12.14
Like, hey, this is going to be a big event. Was there any kind of adjustment to the grand strategy or anything?

1026
01:15:12.14 --> 01:15:19.14
Well, there was, as I found out, doing great. But no, at the time on the ground, no, we didn't know anything about strategic leadership.

1027
01:15:19.14 --> 01:15:25.14
We're just a bunch of young guys flying cobras going where we were needed and shooting up a storm.

1028
01:15:25.14 --> 01:15:34.14
All right. So as this is going on, I'm going to fast forward in the book a little bit to a brigade briefing situation.

1029
01:15:34.14 --> 01:15:38.14
It says the brigade staff briefed the situation. It was not good.

1030
01:15:38.14 --> 01:15:42.14
Each delivered remarks in English, and this is the Vietnamese Airborne Brigade.

1031
01:15:42.14 --> 01:15:47.14
Each delivered remarks in English followed by detailed explanation of Vietnamese to ensure full understanding by all.

1032
01:15:47.14 --> 01:15:54.14
The presentations emphasized that enemy numbers increased daily, flowing in from sanctuaries across the border in Laos and Cambodia.

1033
01:15:54.14 --> 01:15:58.14
The tempo of NVA operations inside South Vietnam had picked up.

1034
01:15:58.14 --> 01:16:02.14
They shelled military outposts and even major installations.

1035
01:16:02.14 --> 01:16:06.14
That included the vital airfield in Can Thuong City.

1036
01:16:06.14 --> 01:16:13.14
The North Vietnamese brought large numbers of anti-aircraft machine guns with them and shot at every aircraft in range.

1037
01:16:13.14 --> 01:16:17.14
They appeared to be on the cusp of something big.

1038
01:16:17.14 --> 01:16:25.14
Colonel Leak, Leak, uh, Leak, Colonel Leak, Colonel Leak stood up to give his personal appraisal in English.

1039
01:16:25.14 --> 01:16:32.14
The enemy will come from Laos on Route 512 and move east to Thanh Can.

1040
01:16:32.14 --> 01:16:38.14
They come from Cambodia on New Road. They build along old French route.

1041
01:16:38.14 --> 01:16:42.14
That set up attack on Can Thuong City, both from west and north.

1042
01:16:42.14 --> 01:16:50.14
Once take Can Thuong, they move to Playa Kho, then turn east and attack through An Khe to coast.

1043
01:16:50.14 --> 01:16:56.14
They cut our country in half just like they do to beat French in 1954.

1044
01:16:56.14 --> 01:17:01.14
John looked questioningly at May. I'll tell you more about that later, May whispered.

1045
01:17:01.14 --> 01:17:08.14
He looks squarely up. He looks squarely at those who stood before him, his face firm.

1046
01:17:08.14 --> 01:17:13.14
Situation tense. Big US cargo helicopter CH-47 Chinook.

1047
01:17:13.14 --> 01:17:17.14
Shoot down yesterday at Delta. Helicopter crash.

1048
01:17:17.14 --> 01:17:22.14
Crew survive and get inside fire base. Another helicopter come for pickup crew.

1049
01:17:22.14 --> 01:17:28.14
Cannot. Too many VC. No aircraft can get close to Delta. Too many machine gun.

1050
01:17:28.14 --> 01:17:36.14
Finally he gave their orders. You, the 11th Airborne Battalion, go on to fire base Charlie just north of Delta tomorrow.

1051
01:17:36.14 --> 01:17:42.14
Bow. You are strongest battalion. I know you only 56% strength.

1052
01:17:42.14 --> 01:17:50.14
You should be 836 paratroopers, officer and enlisted. You have only 471. Still, you my strongest.

1053
01:17:50.14 --> 01:17:59.14
I put you in most critical place. Your mission. Occupy positions on old fire base and defend it at all costs.

1054
01:17:59.14 --> 01:18:07.14
Peter comma turned to John and Peter commas the senior overall senior advisor at the brigade level. He is.

1055
01:18:07.14 --> 01:18:12.14
He turns to John Duffy and says that string of hilltop fire bases. It's known as rocket Ridge.

1056
01:18:12.14 --> 01:18:21.14
It is the key to the defense of Contum and therefore all of central Vietnam.

1057
01:18:21.14 --> 01:18:28.14
After the briefing comma and Duffy talked outside. John asked why do they call it rocket rocket rocket Ridge.

1058
01:18:28.14 --> 01:18:38.14
Peter explained the Americans named it rocket Ridge years ago. The enemy used to used to fire 122 millimeter rockets from its heights down onto the highway and villages below.

1059
01:18:38.14 --> 01:18:44.14
The US Army built a series of fire bases to control the ridge line denying it to the NBA. Now the communists want it back.

1060
01:18:44.14 --> 01:18:50.14
They need it for their invasions plan. Their invasion plans. He went on. It's April Fool's Day, but this is no joke.

1061
01:18:50.14 --> 01:18:56.14
A rocket Ridge is vulnerable. Hell, the whole region is vulnerable. We're facing the better part of two NBA divisions plus reinforcements.

1062
01:18:56.14 --> 01:19:03.14
Friendly forces are grossly outnumbered 17 kilometers north of South Vietnamese 22nd Division is not well regarded.

1063
01:19:03.14 --> 01:19:11.14
Their new commander Colonel Dat doesn't have a good reputation. He's not an effective leader 17 common kilometers southwest.

1064
01:19:11.14 --> 01:19:19.14
Who knows how long the Arvin Rangers can hold out against a major attack in between is over 20 kilometers of rocket Ridge.

1065
01:19:19.14 --> 01:19:30.14
And I know the bad guys want it. Arvin artillery along that ridge line impedes their maneuver against Ton Con and will disrupt any movement south along Highway 14 toward Contum.

1066
01:19:30.14 --> 01:19:41.14
The fire bases also block his direct path eastward. Should he choose to advance over those hills, the direction of such attack would likely go right over top of Charlie.

1067
01:19:41.14 --> 01:19:52.14
Understood. Duffy said, comma, continued, NBA divisions pushed across the DMZ two days ago. Looks like they're planning something just as big here.

1068
01:19:52.14 --> 01:20:03.14
Intel warns that a thrust out of Cambodia towards Saigon is possible. We're looking at an all out invasion of the south by vote by North Vietnam.

1069
01:20:03.14 --> 01:20:10.14
And we've got no American troops in the highlands. We've pulled most of our units out of Vietnam here in two core.

1070
01:20:10.14 --> 01:20:16.14
There are no American ground forces left at all. They're all gone.

1071
01:20:16.14 --> 01:20:25.14
We've got only a few US Army helicopter companies and some US Air Force tack of tack air available and the B 52s out of Guam or Thailand.

1072
01:20:25.14 --> 01:20:30.14
When we get them, that's it. Winning the fight on the ground is now up to the Arvin.

1073
01:20:30.14 --> 01:20:38.14
Peters brow lowered this brigade was a strategic reserve for the nation. It's now been committed.

1074
01:20:38.14 --> 01:20:44.14
The 11th Airborne Battalion was our reserve within the brigade. Now you're being committed.

1075
01:20:44.14 --> 01:20:51.14
That leaves nothing. There's nobody else. No one to come in behind you. No reinforcements. You're it.

1076
01:20:51.14 --> 01:20:56.14
You've got to hold at Charlie and stop the NBA from crossing Rocket Ridge.

1077
01:20:56.14 --> 01:21:06.14
They cannot take that high ground and gain access along Highway 14 straight into Contum.

1078
01:21:06.14 --> 01:21:09.14
It's quite a responsibility.

1079
01:21:09.14 --> 01:21:35.14
Yeah. And when you've got a map in here that kind of lays it out, it's it's sort of like a classic sort of military operation where you can see exactly this beautiful high ground, the low ground that it gives access to the way it sets up sort of being able to cut across Vietnam and split the country into control supplies and all this.

1080
01:21:35.14 --> 01:21:45.14
It's like a classic military critical decisive engagement or decisive ground.

1081
01:21:45.14 --> 01:21:52.14
Peter, comma, studied John and noted you're the lone advisor with this battalion. That's usually a team of three two officers and an NCO.

1082
01:21:52.14 --> 01:21:59.14
You'll need a backup in case you get wounded. Only an American can call in US air strikes and helicopters. That includes Medevac.

1083
01:21:59.14 --> 01:22:06.14
I've got a special forces lieutenant. I'll give you he's away on mid tour leave right now, but he'll be back in a few days. He can join you then.

1084
01:22:06.14 --> 01:22:10.14
John thought a moment. No, thanks. I've got it. I don't plan on getting wounded.

1085
01:22:10.14 --> 01:22:14.14
And I've been working alone with these guys for a while now. Not a problem.

1086
01:22:14.14 --> 01:22:17.14
Okay, but if you change your mind, let me know.

1087
01:22:17.14 --> 01:22:30.14
Comma's assessment of Duffy. He thought he was nuts, but he took him to be confident and brave very much up to the task at hand. Peter would do all he could to get him the support he knew he'd need to defend Charlie.

1088
01:22:30.14 --> 01:22:41.14
As an afterthought comma added tomorrow's Easter Sunday. God be with you. Duffy smiled. Thanks. Happy Easter.

1089
01:22:41.14 --> 01:22:42.14
Did you talk to Peter comma?

1090
01:22:42.14 --> 01:22:54.14
I did at length and Peter regrettably passed away this past year. So it's a shame and Peter is the one that submitted Duffy for the Medal of Honor because of this action.

1091
01:22:54.14 --> 01:23:02.14
That Medal of Honor got downgraded to a Distinguished Service Cross at the time with new evidence and some of that was the voice recording that I talked about.

1092
01:23:02.14 --> 01:23:17.14
Peter resubmitted the award in 2012 and pushed. He got centered on no way involved. Other senators, congressmen, but that whole bureaucracy took years to finally get accomplished.

1093
01:23:17.14 --> 01:23:27.14
And it's just, it's too bad that Peter didn't live to see all this come to fruition or live long enough to see the book in its final form.

1094
01:23:27.14 --> 01:23:34.14
I had to read this section here because we do have a lot of military folks that listen to this and this is a pretty cool gear list.

1095
01:23:34.14 --> 01:23:47.14
Each paratrooper carried, this is getting ready for this operation. Secure this hill. Each paratrooper carried an M16 rifle, seven magazines of ammunition, hand grenades, a small and trenching tool, a canteen and combat rations, both Vietnamese and American sea rations.

1096
01:23:47.14 --> 01:24:00.14
The officers also carried 45 caliber pistols. Each company took two M60 machine guns, nine M70 grenade launchers and a number of light anti-tank weapons, claymore mines and 60 millimeter mortars.

1097
01:24:00.14 --> 01:24:12.14
The headquarters company weapons platoon brought the heavier 81 millimeter mortars and 90 millimeter recoilless rifles, piles of ammo, water cans, medical supplies along with food provisions,

1098
01:24:12.14 --> 01:24:22.14
and sat ready to be hauled to Charlie on later lifts after the paratroopers were in place. Duffy brought what many thought was overkill, but he knew it was not.

1099
01:24:22.14 --> 01:24:30.14
He had a carbine and the standard Army backpack radio known affectionately as the Prick 25, the PRC 25 FM radio.

1100
01:24:30.14 --> 01:24:39.14
His assigned radio telephone operator, RTO, carried that. In Duffy's rucksack, he had a long folding whip antenna for the radio, three extra batteries,

1101
01:24:39.14 --> 01:24:46.14
and a commercial long range AM FM radio to monitor armed forces Vietnam network news broadcasts.

1102
01:24:46.14 --> 01:24:56.14
He filled the remainder of the space in the pack with Lerp rations, a few cans of sea ration fruit, extra socks, a poncho liner, four fragmentary grenades and four smoke grenades.

1103
01:24:56.14 --> 01:24:59.14
He stuffed his uniform pockets as well.

1104
01:24:59.14 --> 01:25:09.14
He filled the four large shirt pockets and cargo pant pockets with two signal panels, compass, signal mirror, strobe light, small flashlight, knife, P38 can opener,

1105
01:25:09.14 --> 01:25:19.14
map, notebooks wrapped in plastic, pens for writing, plus markers for his map. On his web belt and harness, he'd fastened 28 20 round ammo magazines,

1106
01:25:19.14 --> 01:25:29.14
four smoke grenades, two fragmentary grenades, flares, snap links, a sharp killing knife, two water canteens and a medical kit that included compress bandages, band aids, tourniquets, morphine,

1107
01:25:29.14 --> 01:25:39.14
and a self injection blood volume expander. He also clipped on two emergency aircrew survival radios. Pretty good loadout.

1108
01:25:39.14 --> 01:25:55.14
It is and very few other advisors ever carried those aircrew survival radios. John was very insightful because in the end, one of those survival radios is what's going to save his life and the life of those who survived that battle.

1109
01:25:55.14 --> 01:26:07.14
Yeah, having a backup radio and then having another backup radio to that backup radio. The radio that came after the 110 was the 112. So when I got in, in the SEAL teams, we would get issued the 112, which is the same concept.

1110
01:26:07.14 --> 01:26:21.14
But I had to use that 112 a couple of times just in admin situations, but you know, your main primary radio floods out. And one thing that was nice about those PRC 112s, they were relatively waterproof compared to every other radio we had.

1111
01:26:21.14 --> 01:26:25.14
So sometimes they would come in handy and apparently Duffy knew that.

1112
01:26:25.14 --> 01:26:35.14
Yeah, yeah, well, it certainly did. Yeah, and his backpack radio was a Prick 25, I think earlier I might have said Prick 77, which was a later radio. Yeah, Prick 25.

1113
01:26:35.14 --> 01:26:46.14
Again, you've got a map in the book here as these guys, they get inserted into this ridgeline. It's a ridgeline. That's what it is.

1114
01:26:46.14 --> 01:26:54.14
And this one battalion gets assigned this one section of the ridgeline. This section of the ridgeline is called Charlie.

1115
01:26:54.14 --> 01:27:04.14
We'll refer to some of the stuff and again, get the book so you can you can see this stuff visually. But Charlie one is a section of this ridgeline. That's sort of a saddle.

1116
01:27:04.14 --> 01:27:14.14
And then there's Charlie two, which is a null to the south. And Charlie three is a little null to the north. Right.

1117
01:27:14.14 --> 01:27:23.14
And there's four companies that make up the battalion. And each one of these companies at this juncture has about 100 guys, maybe just over 100 guys each.

1118
01:27:23.14 --> 01:27:33.14
The companies are 111, 112, 113, 114. Right. And headquarters company in addition to that.

1119
01:27:33.14 --> 01:27:38.14
And the headquarters company is 110. Right.

1120
01:27:38.14 --> 01:27:45.14
There and so they spread out kind of on this ridgeline with 113 on the on the north null.

1121
01:27:45.14 --> 01:27:58.14
111 in the saddle 112 on the south null. And then 114 has the far kind of south flank. And I guess the 110 is sort of on top of Charlie two.

1122
01:27:58.14 --> 01:28:10.14
Right. Yeah. Charlie two has got the headquarters 110 and then it's got those two other companies as a one defending principally the southwest and the other the or the southeast and the other no southwest and the other the northeast.

1123
01:28:10.14 --> 01:28:21.14
And again, just to simplify this if you're only listening, it's a ridgeline. Right. And there's several nolls and some saddles on the red line and these guys get inserted to lock down this whole thing.

1124
01:28:21.14 --> 01:28:34.14
And I think it's important to mention that Ridgeline is rising to the north and and some of it there's there's high terrain overlooking the the nolls that you just discussed from the northwest.

1125
01:28:34.14 --> 01:28:42.14
So bow is going to become concerned that he doesn't like this terrain because yes he's on a ridge but the ridge is getting higher to the north.

1126
01:28:42.14 --> 01:28:55.14
There is overlooking higher terrain to the northwest that he's below and then and you may get to it. There's a very threatening finger of nolls pointing at his position from the south.

1127
01:28:55.14 --> 01:29:01.14
Yeah, it is a tenuous position to say the least.

1128
01:29:01.14 --> 01:29:13.14
These guys get in position. It relatively smooth. But you say here follow on helicopter list brought shovels, sandbags, additional ammunition, water, food as well as medical supplies, headquarters equipment and a few personal items.

1129
01:29:13.14 --> 01:29:27.14
I had to I had to bring this up. Duffy quickly retrieved his folding aluminum lawn chair from the landing zone. It was a small extravagance in which he took pride in having along paratroopers duly harassed him as he carried it up back up the hill.

1130
01:29:27.14 --> 01:29:36.14
And then there was the air mattress is stuffed into his rucksack and might turn into a hell of a fight. But John Duffy intended to make it as comfortable of a fight as possible.

1131
01:29:36.14 --> 01:29:46.14
I can't imagine that I can't imagine actually that aluminum chair. I remember guys occasionally bring like not not in a combat but go into a range or something.

1132
01:29:46.14 --> 01:29:52.14
Right. You know, you'd be out on a range all day sitin and weapons or whatever and someone would show up and these days, you know, the aluminum chairs are pretty nice.

1133
01:29:52.14 --> 01:30:02.14
I remember one guy had one that was like an aluminum recliner and it had a self contained umbrella on it. So we're all out in the in getting beat down in the sun.

1134
01:30:02.14 --> 01:30:12.14
This is a seal. Yeah. Yeah. And he's of course like got his feet up with a with a freaking hell of umbrella, a son umbrella over him.

1135
01:30:12.14 --> 01:30:19.14
And he kind of won. We're all jealous. You know, of course, we're going to make fun of him and, you know, tell me he's a wimp, but we were kind of jealous at the same time.

1136
01:30:19.14 --> 01:30:28.14
So Duffy Duffy's got his aluminum chair. John was comfortable only for a short time. Yeah, I'm sure we'll get to. Yeah.

1137
01:30:28.14 --> 01:30:37.14
Fast forward a little bit. And again, you put it incredible about a research in detail of this. So get the book to understand the full picture.

1138
01:30:37.14 --> 01:30:43.14
I'm going to fast forward a little bit to here we go. The radios came alive at dawn. The tense chatter woke May.

1139
01:30:43.14 --> 01:30:50.14
He grabbed his gear and headed to the command post bunker. He found bow already there and tentatively listening to radios with high.

1140
01:30:50.14 --> 01:30:59.14
Duffy soon bent his tall frame through the sandbag entrance and joined them firebath firebase delta only two miles to the south of Charlie was under attack.

1141
01:30:59.14 --> 01:31:04.14
It was Monday, April 3rd, the day after Easter.

1142
01:31:04.14 --> 01:31:18.14
Bow turned to May. Form an assault force of 112 and 114 companies leave the headquarters 110 company here to defend Charlie to lead task force may along that finger like Ridge to the southeast.

1143
01:31:18.14 --> 01:31:26.14
If the enemy is there push him off and kill him. The Ridge has three nolls like knuckles of a finger advance all the way to the third knuckle and secure it.

1144
01:31:26.14 --> 01:31:35.14
We need to control that high ground. It should also take some pressure off second battalion may acknowledged with his usual positive tone. Yes, sir.

1145
01:31:35.14 --> 01:31:47.14
He added a quest. Can I take major Duffy with me? No, we've only got one advisor. I have to have him with me. You can call in VNA air strikes and artillery is immediately available.

1146
01:31:47.14 --> 01:31:53.14
Duffy can coordinate us air power from here.

1147
01:31:53.14 --> 01:32:01.14
So it's on and may gets again. These are like classic infantry assault maneuvers that are happening.

1148
01:32:01.14 --> 01:32:09.14
Fast forward a little bit may ordered a coordinated attack by his two companies. They moved up the hill shooting and maneuvering to gain an advantage against their foe.

1149
01:32:09.14 --> 01:32:19.14
They got close enough to see hastily constructed enemy fortifications with overhead cover may called in a strike of VNA F a one sky raiders.

1150
01:32:19.14 --> 01:32:25.14
The airplanes carried an awesome load of ordinance including rockets, bombs, napalm and machine guns.

1151
01:32:25.14 --> 01:32:33.14
Before the dust settled may ordered 114 114 company to renew the attack.

1152
01:32:33.14 --> 01:32:42.14
Cho led with a reinforced platoon. They overran the bunkers with the loss of one paratrooper killed and another wounded for North Vietnamese soldiers lay dead.

1153
01:32:42.14 --> 01:32:52.14
The mangled remains of a 51 caliber machine gun sat nearby may consolidated his task force around the site and prepared to continue the attack to the top of the hill.

1154
01:32:52.14 --> 01:33:01.14
The NVA didn't give him time. They shot 75 millimeter recoilless rifle rounds. They swept down from the heights firing and screaming.

1155
01:33:01.14 --> 01:33:11.14
More paratroopers fell, but they held their ground may organized a counterattack of his own and soon pushed the enemy back up the hill only to run out of steam as the force encountered stiff resistance.

1156
01:33:11.14 --> 01:33:17.14
The morning turned afternoon as the battle waxed and waned.

1157
01:33:17.14 --> 01:33:25.14
So this this had to be at least a little bit different that these that the NVA is they're ready to fight.

1158
01:33:25.14 --> 01:33:32.14
They're ready to just engage when for most the war it was when they get contacted. They'll do some damage and run away.

1159
01:33:32.14 --> 01:33:42.14
As I said, the war had changed this complexion. This was a conventional NVA assault. And they're going to find out they're up against multiple NVA battalions.

1160
01:33:42.14 --> 01:33:51.14
The elements of the 64th NVA regiment is what they're facing. And then they can end up before it's over and done facing a battalion from another regiment.

1161
01:33:51.14 --> 01:33:58.14
So they're outnumbered somewhere in the neighborhood of eight or 10 to one on that hilltop.

1162
01:33:58.14 --> 01:34:04.14
I'm going to fast forward a little bit just before sunset. The enemy threw a fresh infantry company into the fight.

1163
01:34:04.14 --> 01:34:15.14
They slammed down the western flank of the paratroopers causing them not causing them to bend but not break. Task Force may held but would advance no further that day.

1164
01:34:15.14 --> 01:34:21.14
The progress they'd made had cost a dozen casualties killed and wounded. Colonel bow faced the decision.

1165
01:34:21.14 --> 01:34:28.14
Leave the task force in place with hopes of at least securing the first null the next day or bring them back to Charlie too.

1166
01:34:28.14 --> 01:34:40.14
The short handed battalion spread its limited manpower thinly across fire base Charlie. Bow had three separate locations to defend along the ridge stretching over half a mile to end to end.

1167
01:34:40.14 --> 01:34:50.14
He had further deployed a huge chunk of his force almost a mile to the southeast attempting to gain yet more real estate in an increasingly costly fight.

1168
01:34:50.14 --> 01:35:02.14
The sunset and all he had left to defend Charlie to was one 10 company consisting of the headquarters personnel and weapons platoon bow issued his order after dark dark.

1169
01:35:02.14 --> 01:35:14.14
Task Force may disengage recover your dead and wounded and return to Charlie to with as much stealth as possible may brought his force off the Null and across the wide saddle.

1170
01:35:14.14 --> 01:35:29.14
He led his exhausted men back onto Charlie to a little after 9pm. 112 and 114 companies returned to their previous positions on the perimeter.

1171
01:35:29.14 --> 01:35:36.14
That night may scratched out a letter to his wife, Sen by the light of a small flickering candle.

1172
01:35:36.14 --> 01:35:42.14
He hoped he'd get it out on one of the resupply helicopters. It read.

1173
01:35:42.14 --> 01:35:50.14
This may be my last letter for a while. The situation is approaching critical. The colonel is doing all that is possible.

1174
01:35:50.14 --> 01:36:01.14
The NVA will surely push forward and we will do battle. I may soon fight in a ferocious fight. The commanders and paratroopers are ready.

1175
01:36:01.14 --> 01:36:09.14
Perhaps all will not return from this fight. That is the fate of soldiers serving their country.

1176
01:36:09.14 --> 01:36:18.14
My thoughts will always be with you. My heart will always belong to you. My strength is a tribute to your love.

1177
01:36:18.14 --> 01:36:29.14
Our children are a testament to our love. Do not worry when you hear reports of the battle. I am ready and I know how to survive in combat.

1178
01:36:29.14 --> 01:36:41.14
I will come back home to you, my precious love. I will fight the dragons and return to your arms.

1179
01:36:41.14 --> 01:36:48.14
And I included his letter in there and that took some discussion with him and his wife to see if we wanted to put that in there.

1180
01:36:48.14 --> 01:36:57.14
But in the end we decided to. And it just really, I wanted this story to be as much a human interest story as just a combat account.

1181
01:36:57.14 --> 01:37:02.14
And that really shows the humanity of May and his family.

1182
01:37:02.14 --> 01:37:06.14
Yeah, no, that's did they have like a copy of the letter?

1183
01:37:06.14 --> 01:37:12.14
It was a recollection I think. I don't know if they have the actual copy but I was able to get the words.

1184
01:37:12.14 --> 01:37:18.14
Yeah, and again, I mean I fast forwarded you go through the courtship and the children, like all that stuff.

1185
01:37:18.14 --> 01:37:25.14
And it is very obviously a very human story. And here's this guy. What's interesting about that as I was reading that.

1186
01:37:25.14 --> 01:37:36.14
You know, I've read plenty of sort of, I guess they call them death letters, you know, in case I don't make it type type letters.

1187
01:37:36.14 --> 01:37:44.14
And here's May who's writing, hey look, it's coming, but I'm going to be okay. I know how to survive and I'm ready.

1188
01:37:44.14 --> 01:37:51.14
That's a very positive attitude for him to have going into this situation for sure.

1189
01:37:51.14 --> 01:38:05.14
And she gets that letter and she gets it right or right after she got it, the news, the available public information of what's going on in the Highlands gets very dire and disturbing.

1190
01:38:05.14 --> 01:38:12.14
All right, I'm going to fast forward a little bit to where the team has now been on the ground for three days.

1191
01:38:12.14 --> 01:38:19.14
It's been three days since the arrival. So here we go Thursday, April 6th arrived with Charlie once again shrouded in fog.

1192
01:38:19.14 --> 01:38:26.14
Earriness settled over the hilltop. All wondered what the enemy was up to behind the mist. They could only imagine.

1193
01:38:26.14 --> 01:38:33.14
Annam, which is, which means big brother, which is what they called Lieutenant Colonel Bowell, one of the nicknames they gave him.

1194
01:38:33.14 --> 01:38:34.14
Right.

1195
01:38:34.14 --> 01:38:40.14
Assembled his officers and staff, save Big Hung because of 113's distance from the rest of the Italian.

1196
01:38:40.14 --> 01:38:45.14
He summarized their situation and issued an order that he'd relay to Hong by radio.

1197
01:38:45.14 --> 01:38:53.14
The NVA have us surrounded. They hold the mountain tops. They've positioned their guns to shoot down the helicopters.

1198
01:38:53.14 --> 01:39:00.14
It is here we must do battle. It is here we must bleed them. Do not let them take our positions.

1199
01:39:00.14 --> 01:39:11.14
This battle is to the end. Tell the paratroopers to fight bravely. Tell them to aim all their bullets well, for we may lose the ability to resupply.

1200
01:39:11.14 --> 01:39:21.14
Dig in deep and prepare for combat. Any trooper not ready to fight, I want him off the mountain. I'll not have him die with us.

1201
01:39:21.14 --> 01:39:28.14
I'll not have him share in our glory. So that's a dire situation.

1202
01:39:28.14 --> 01:39:46.14
These anti-aircraft glances, 51 caliber, it seems like this is an extreme amount of enemy anti-aircraft weaponry that they have in this situation.

1203
01:39:46.14 --> 01:39:54.14
It was more than we had seen inside of South Vietnam at any point up to that battle. They had numerous 51 calibers.

1204
01:39:54.14 --> 01:39:58.14
That's a deadly weapon against helicopters.

1205
01:39:58.14 --> 01:40:13.14
That's the impression I got as I read that the way this battle unfolds. It seemed like most of the time there was enough confidence in helicopters.

1206
01:40:13.14 --> 01:40:28.14
I'm not sure there were some landing zones that would be so bad, but it wouldn't last for very long or they could put down fire and eventually get in there. This one is the NVA is definitely looking to deny access from the air.

1207
01:40:28.14 --> 01:40:32.14
Yep, they were.

1208
01:40:32.14 --> 01:40:45.14
Fast forward a little bit. The fog lifted shortly before noon. Duffy went back to work running airstrikes. He teamed with May and High to integrate all available fire support onto the most lucrative targets.

1209
01:40:45.14 --> 01:41:00.14
With the priority of air support going against NVA offensives far to the north and south, little could be allocated to Charlie. So there's other battles that are taking place that are soaking up a lot of the air support.

1210
01:41:00.14 --> 01:41:11.14
Yes, and the biggest one was that thrust across the demilitarized zone in the north. That was the, and the south started losing Quang Chi Province. The enemy was just moving rapidly to the south.

1211
01:41:11.14 --> 01:41:19.14
And then once they came out of Cambodia towards Saigon, they got as far as An Locke before they were stopped. But yeah, there was a worry on all fronts.

1212
01:41:19.14 --> 01:41:28.14
The loss of Quang Chi Province to the north and possibly Way City, which was the old Imperial capital, and then that threat against Saigon to the south.

1213
01:41:28.14 --> 01:41:37.14
So the central highland, though it was critically important for not getting Vietnam cut in half at the waist, as the Viet Minh had done against the French.

1214
01:41:37.14 --> 01:41:50.14
I mean, we hear about Dien Bien Phu being the decisive battle, but really the thrust across the south and the destruction of French group Mobile 100 contributed to the end of that war against the French as much as any.

1215
01:41:50.14 --> 01:42:01.14
So yeah, all those worries, but yeah, there's demands for air everywhere. And though the U.S. is there to provide air support and in the north some naval gunfire, it's stretched thin.

1216
01:42:01.14 --> 01:42:15.14
You say this. John developed a technique of constantly badgering forward air controllers to divert their airstrikes that were not available to hit their primary targets because of weather or situational changes.

1217
01:42:15.14 --> 01:42:23.14
He got a number of much needed missions that way. So he would just stay on the radio. Hey, what do you got? You got any extra ammo? Is there anybody that can't drop? Is anybody that needs to get rid of some ammo?

1218
01:42:23.14 --> 01:42:27.14
And again, that's John Duffy. If you know John, you can see him doing that.

1219
01:42:27.14 --> 01:42:30.14
He's just like a Brooklyn guy out there trying to make it happen.

1220
01:42:30.14 --> 01:42:32.14
Yep, he won't let go.

1221
01:42:32.14 --> 01:42:45.14
For the rest of the day, Duffy worked with Ford air controllers Covey 507 531 and 546 putting in Air Force F4 Phantoms and Navy a seven course airs on the finger.

1222
01:42:45.14 --> 01:42:55.14
May and high added VN AF a one Sky Raiders and a 37 Dragon flies to the mix along with a number of artillery barrages.

1223
01:42:55.14 --> 01:43:05.14
The effort produced good effects with the destruction of bunkers and mortars and two dozen secondary explosions. They'd inflicted pain on their enemy.

1224
01:43:05.14 --> 01:43:12.14
Fast forward a little bit. The day's good weather ended. Clouds billowed around Charlie and the airstrike ceased for the day.

1225
01:43:12.14 --> 01:43:19.14
The paratroopers faced the evening with an ominous feeling that conditions were developing for a big fight on Charlie.

1226
01:43:19.14 --> 01:43:36.14
Disturbing radio calls at eight o'clock that night confirmed those suspicions. John received the message in English over his advisor channel at the same time the second brigade transmitted it on the Arvin network in Vietnamese intelligence indicates the NBA plan to overrun Charlie.

1227
01:43:36.14 --> 01:43:41.14
Repeat. Intelligence believes the NBA intend to overrun your positions.

1228
01:43:41.14 --> 01:43:50.14
Bow grabbed the handset from highs radio operator. This is great tiger request to maneuver on offensive operations to take the fight to the enemy.

1229
01:43:50.14 --> 01:44:00.14
I don't want to sit in place on Charlie and wait to absorb the attack. The enemy has designed airborne doesn't sit and wait. It attacks.

1230
01:44:00.14 --> 01:44:07.14
I'll consolidate leave one company on Charlie to and launch an attack with the rest of the battalion.

1231
01:44:07.14 --> 01:44:19.14
The reply came back immediately from the brigade commander Colonel Lee Colonel lick himself negative defend in place block any potential crossing of the ridge.

1232
01:44:19.14 --> 01:44:23.14
Fight to the death on Charlie. Those are your orders.

1233
01:44:23.14 --> 01:44:30.14
Fight to the death.

1234
01:44:30.14 --> 01:44:42.14
So bow being an airborne commander wants to go on the attack. He does. Yeah. Light highly mobile forces just sitting there defending waiting for the enemy to mass his force and to send upon you.

1235
01:44:42.14 --> 01:44:54.14
But they get the message loud and clear that was their mission to stay there to the bitter end and defend that that hilltop.

1236
01:44:54.14 --> 01:45:03.14
Which they do in fine form and the only reason there's going to be any survivors at all is they are out of the ability to damage the enemy.

1237
01:45:03.14 --> 01:45:11.14
So the few people left are withdrawn off off the hill.

1238
01:45:11.14 --> 01:45:17.14
Fast forward a little bit Sunday marked a week since the 11th airborne battalions assault on to Charlie.

1239
01:45:17.14 --> 01:45:26.14
They also marked a new conviction among the paratroopers the line had been drawn in the sand. They would fight until victory or until death.

1240
01:45:26.14 --> 01:45:32.14
The weather cleared by noon helicopters arrived with more ammunition water and rations including some live chickens for roasting.

1241
01:45:32.14 --> 01:45:38.14
They had also brought mail to the delight of the beleaguered paratroopers Peter comma even put some candy bars on the aircraft for John.

1242
01:45:38.14 --> 01:45:43.14
He shared them with the others.

1243
01:45:43.14 --> 01:45:52.14
The first day of April 11th. Fast forward April 11th 1972. This day. Hell unleashed its fury at a place called Charlie.

1244
01:45:52.14 --> 01:45:59.14
At midnight. John Duffy's radio came to life. Dusty side and I this is Kovie 555.

1245
01:45:59.14 --> 01:46:04.14
Following message relayed from blue chip through carbon outlaw.

1246
01:46:04.14 --> 01:46:12.14
Arc light inbound to target location per year request. Estimated drop in 30 minutes.

1247
01:46:12.14 --> 01:46:20.14
The air was high in the operations bunker may join them there high radio the companies commanders alerted their paratroopers.

1248
01:46:20.14 --> 01:46:34.14
As the drop time approach each crouched down in a foxhole trench or bunker held his helmet on his head and open his mouth hoping to equalize the pressure of the coming blasts that he had been told would be very close.

1249
01:46:34.14 --> 01:46:55.14
Terror rain from the sky hundreds of 500 and 750 pound bombs fell from the high flying B 52s the closest hit only 300 yards from one 14 company blasting the nearest null of the finger ridge exploding its shoulders and smashing a swath of obliteration along the

1250
01:46:55.14 --> 01:47:06.14
ridge line to the southeast the earth shook the destruction was horrific and lethal debris rained down even on nearby friendlies.

1251
01:47:06.14 --> 01:47:16.14
The NBA answered the blow with barrages of artillery mortars and recoilless rifle fire while they licked their wounds and rethought their attack plans.

1252
01:47:16.14 --> 01:47:26.14
Their shells blasted the hill but they did little to paratroopers still lying low in their trenches after the B 52 strike the shelling continued sporadically through the night.

1253
01:47:26.14 --> 01:47:37.14
Even so those not standing watch were able to fall back asleep for some moments of rest fitful as it might have been.

1254
01:47:37.14 --> 01:47:57.14
Those B 52 strikes John wanted them badly of course priority was going a lot of other areas. One thing that I do point out in the book Peter comma before he became the brigade advisor was working with the commander of all forces in Vietnam.

1255
01:47:57.14 --> 01:48:12.14
The deputy commander at the time general way and so he had a connection to the top levels of the command in Vietnam and was able to leverage that on a couple of occasions to get some B 52 strikes diverted.

1256
01:48:12.14 --> 01:48:19.14
But yeah John wanted those B 52s badly and he got that that first one that night just after midnight.

1257
01:48:19.14 --> 01:48:23.14
What's the closest you ever were when one of those arc light strikes.

1258
01:48:23.14 --> 01:48:25.14
Oh it was a good ways away.

1259
01:48:25.14 --> 01:48:29.14
It sounds like they were just insane.

1260
01:48:29.14 --> 01:48:43.14
Yeah before the John thinks that he was the first one and I have not been able to confirm it John thinks he was the first one to work B 52 strikes and that close of proximity to friendly forces that before that they were always tried to keep them 500 meters away.

1261
01:48:43.14 --> 01:48:45.14
He brought that down to 300 meters.

1262
01:48:45.14 --> 01:48:54.14
I think in one case I don't remember was this one or the next one but they said hey you got to be at least 500 meters away and John said yeah we are close but no no one he wasn't nearly that far away.

1263
01:48:54.14 --> 01:48:56.14
Yeah it just turns.

1264
01:48:56.14 --> 01:49:04.14
I think you said three football fields in length just total destruction just destroys everything in that area.

1265
01:49:04.14 --> 01:49:10.14
It is a normal arc light would be three B 52s flying and formation and letting all their bombs go.

1266
01:49:10.14 --> 01:49:15.14
That's quite quite a massive path of destruction.

1267
01:49:15.14 --> 01:49:25.14
Fast forward a little bit reports come in of more NBA soldiers only a few hundred yards to the southwest.

1268
01:49:25.14 --> 01:49:34.14
More kilos came in to resupply the beleaguered 11th battalion both VN AF and American the 51 caliber machine guns fired relentlessly.

1269
01:49:34.14 --> 01:49:39.14
The few choppers that braved an approach took debilitating hits before turning away.

1270
01:49:39.14 --> 01:49:53.14
None were able to get through the deadly wall of bullets and V a machine guns blazed away at any helicopter that came in range at least 1051 caliber positions now ringed Charlie.

1271
01:49:53.14 --> 01:49:55.14
That's a nightmare.

1272
01:49:55.14 --> 01:50:00.14
Duffy turned to me those machine guns are out there to kill they're doing their job.

1273
01:50:00.14 --> 01:50:01.14
They're good.

1274
01:50:01.14 --> 01:50:05.14
Yes big problem for us problem for resupply and evacuate wounded.

1275
01:50:05.14 --> 01:50:06.14
John nodded.

1276
01:50:06.14 --> 01:50:12.14
I'm worried the fire is too intense they can't get in all we're going to do is get more helicopters shot down.

1277
01:50:12.14 --> 01:50:14.14
I'm closing the LZ.

1278
01:50:14.14 --> 01:50:17.14
Tell me if you or Colonel bow have a problem with that.

1279
01:50:17.14 --> 01:50:20.14
Duffy took the radio handset from his RTO seller five one.

1280
01:50:20.14 --> 01:50:22.14
This is dusty cyanide.

1281
01:50:22.14 --> 01:50:27.14
I'm closing to the I'm closing the LZ to Huey resupply and Medevac helicopters.

1282
01:50:27.14 --> 01:50:31.14
They will not survive the gunfire from the ridges of ridge lines above.

1283
01:50:31.14 --> 01:50:33.14
I repeat the LZ is closed.

1284
01:50:33.14 --> 01:50:36.14
There is no reason attempting the impossible.

1285
01:50:36.14 --> 01:50:42.14
I've got to get rid of some of those 51 cows before we get any more heroes in here.

1286
01:50:42.14 --> 01:50:52.14
He put in more sets of F fours on the surrounding machine gun positions and asked Covey to hit the suspected 130 millimeter gun positions with anything else he had available.

1287
01:50:52.14 --> 01:51:02.14
John Duffy had two problems he must resolve if the 11th Airborne Battalion was to survive kill the anti aircraft machine guns and eliminate the 130 millimeter guns.

1288
01:51:02.14 --> 01:51:05.14
I haven't really mentioned 130 millimeter guns yet.

1289
01:51:05.14 --> 01:51:15.14
They're in the book but there was some heavy artillery that the NVA had that was punishing the guys up on Charlie.

1290
01:51:15.14 --> 01:51:19.14
It was just pounded and pounded and pounded that hilltop and John did his best.

1291
01:51:19.14 --> 01:51:23.14
I mean that's a long range artillery weapon and he tried to get air strikes in on him.

1292
01:51:23.14 --> 01:51:31.14
He will eventually get another B 52 strike out there on him and never throughout the battle was able to completely eliminate those 130 millimeter guns.

1293
01:51:31.14 --> 01:51:37.14
It sounds like he suspected they were dug in like maybe on tracks getting wheeled into caves and pushed back out to shoot.

1294
01:51:37.14 --> 01:51:38.14
Exactly.

1295
01:51:38.14 --> 01:51:42.14
They bring him out to fire and then put him in the protection of the cave.

1296
01:51:42.14 --> 01:51:51.14
Fast forward a little bit April 12 1972 exploding artillery shells took the 11th Battalion shook the 11th Battalion paratroopers awake.

1297
01:51:51.14 --> 01:52:00.14
The 11 company took the brunt heavy artillery mortar rocket and recoilless rifle rain down on hill nine 60 Charlie one.

1298
01:52:00.14 --> 01:52:06.14
75 big 130 millimeter shells slammed onto the hilltop.

1299
01:52:06.14 --> 01:52:12.14
Oh, so let me give you some perspective here.

1300
01:52:12.14 --> 01:52:25.14
I was in a in a combat outpost in Ramadi and we got hit with three hundred and 20 millimeter mortars and it was a shocking nightmare.

1301
01:52:25.14 --> 01:52:31.14
And here they are taking 75 130's.

1302
01:52:31.14 --> 01:52:39.14
That is just I can't even I can't imagine what that what that's like on top of one company and I don't know if we'll get to it.

1303
01:52:39.14 --> 01:52:42.14
But it's either I think it's later.

1304
01:52:42.14 --> 01:52:49.14
Charlie to took 300 rounds and just a couple of hours one day.

1305
01:52:49.14 --> 01:52:56.14
Yeah, I remember seeing from that from that mortar strike I was talking about there's 120 millimeter.

1306
01:52:56.14 --> 01:53:01.14
We found pieces of frag the pieces of frag are there.

1307
01:53:01.14 --> 01:53:11.14
You know when a lot of times when people think of fragmentation they think of these little tiny things that are size of a BB or the size of you know like a little quarter inch piece of frag.

1308
01:53:11.14 --> 01:53:13.14
There's no chunks.

1309
01:53:13.14 --> 01:53:25.14
There was chunks we found frag that was nine inches long and weighed like a pound and a half just gnarly metal shards flying through the air.

1310
01:53:25.14 --> 01:53:30.14
That's how you see that's why you see guys sometimes they lose their entire leg or they lose an arm.

1311
01:53:30.14 --> 01:53:37.14
If they get hit with a piece that just not some little little tiny fragmentation it is a massive chunk of steel flying through the air.

1312
01:53:37.14 --> 01:53:48.14
So and that's I'm talking about two or three mortars hitting a combat outpost you're talking about 75 even bigger shells.

1313
01:53:48.14 --> 01:53:52.14
It's it's it's hard to it's hard to comprehend what that does to you.

1314
01:53:52.14 --> 01:54:05.14
I mean just the concussion alone from that right and by the way I was sitting in a concrete building by the way you know I'm not sitting in a foxhole with a with a poncho over my head right that they dug and those figures.

1315
01:54:05.14 --> 01:54:20.14
You know luckily John as I mentioned earlier he kept a log a journal every day so I've got all the call signs of the facts the type of aircraft number of aircraft location of aircraft that were brought in and the counts that they made at the time of the artillery strikes.

1316
01:54:20.14 --> 01:54:26.14
Charlie won received 70 rounds of 130 millimeter fire.

1317
01:54:26.14 --> 01:54:29.14
What a nightmare.

1318
01:54:29.14 --> 01:54:44.14
Fast forward a little bit the artillery stopped and what that only means one thing the artillery stopped the NBA company rose from the steep gully less than 100 yards to the west of Charlie won trench line scores of enemy soldiers raced forward the fight was on.

1319
01:54:44.14 --> 01:54:49.14
The 111 paratroopers reacted in well practice battle drill.

1320
01:54:49.14 --> 01:55:04.14
Lieutenant thin the company commander quickly assessed the situation Claymore minds had bloodied the lead elements of the attack his soldiers thin the advancing enemy ranks with disciplined well aimed rifle flyer they threw hand grenades in close combat.

1321
01:55:04.14 --> 01:55:06.14
This is just.

1322
01:55:06.14 --> 01:55:10.14
It's on.

1323
01:55:10.14 --> 01:55:14.14
Here's another one fast forward past that skirmish.

1324
01:55:14.14 --> 01:55:21.14
A heavy artillery barrage hit Charlie to 1130 the 130 millimeter shells pummeled the hill.

1325
01:55:21.14 --> 01:55:26.14
One slammed into bows bunker with a deafening explosion.

1326
01:55:26.14 --> 01:55:32.14
It turned the place to rubble broken timbers and shredded sandbags covered the commander.

1327
01:55:32.14 --> 01:55:39.14
High got there first he'd only been several yards away may joined in seconds.

1328
01:55:39.14 --> 01:55:44.14
They began pulling debris off on nom their big brother.

1329
01:55:44.14 --> 01:56:00.14
They summoned doc Lou who came running with Duffy close behind with the help of the nearby paratroopers they pulled bow clear doc Lou went to work but immediately looked up and shook his head their beloved commander was dead.

1330
01:56:00.14 --> 01:56:09.14
He took the the loss hardest of all may didn't have time to grieve he was now the commander all responsibility rested on his shoulders.

1331
01:56:09.14 --> 01:56:17.14
John Duffy looked at the lifeless body sad that bow had not been able to utter his final words in death.

1332
01:56:17.14 --> 01:56:23.14
A feeling overcame John he sensed what Colonel bow's last thoughts must have been.

1333
01:56:23.14 --> 01:56:32.14
He shared his notion with the others I know what Colonel bow wanted to say before he died I hear his voice in my heart.

1334
01:56:32.14 --> 01:56:47.14
Tell my wife I loved her true tell my children to remember me tell my paratroopers to never surrender to you my officers one final salute.

1335
01:56:47.14 --> 01:56:59.14
That's John Duffy the poet but he felt that in his heart and he noted those words down at the time and those are on his website of poetry I think probably in his book as well.

1336
01:56:59.14 --> 01:57:15.14
So now they've lost this their leader their beloved leader their beloved leader big brother Colonel bow killed in one of these insane barrages of artillery.

1337
01:57:15.14 --> 01:57:21.14
Things don't get much better fast forward a little bit Covey brought in a flight of a seven course there's often a v carrier the Coral Sea.

1338
01:57:21.14 --> 01:57:27.14
Their first pass on the South perimeter went terribly wrong they dropped short of the target.

1339
01:57:27.14 --> 01:57:41.14
Their bombs hit the one 14 company trenches killing three and wounded seven frustrated and angry John moved the strike well to the Southwest where he could expend their remaining ordinance before heading back to the ship.

1340
01:57:41.14 --> 01:57:56.14
He targeted 75 millimeter recorrelous rifle and anti aircraft gun positions Duffy had also forward Duffy also had forward air controllers continue to play strikes on the 130 millimeter gun positions in the hills far to the Southwest.

1341
01:57:56.14 --> 01:58:01.14
He firmly believed those big guns were on rails that backed them into tunnels after they had fired.

1342
01:58:01.14 --> 01:58:10.14
He figured that's how they had survived all the air strikes that made them tough targets but they had to be killed.

1343
01:58:10.14 --> 01:58:18.14
At 4pm 130 millimeter round hit the entrance to Duffy's bunker knocking him unconscious.

1344
01:58:18.14 --> 01:58:28.14
He regained his senses but felt warm wet blood covering his head and chest his back hurt to where more shrapnel had torn into him.

1345
01:58:28.14 --> 01:58:36.14
His ears rang he couldn't hear his head throb from a horrendous concussion rubble and body surrounded him.

1346
01:58:36.14 --> 01:58:42.14
John shoved the closest guy and said come on let's go.

1347
01:58:42.14 --> 01:58:46.14
The guy lay still he didn't move he was dead.

1348
01:58:46.14 --> 01:58:59.14
John couldn't believe it all of them dead save his RTO yet John had lived how could that be how in the same space and time could five men die and he live.

1349
01:58:59.14 --> 01:59:02.14
He stared at the carnage in shock.

1350
01:59:02.14 --> 01:59:10.14
Finally he grabbed his car 15 and dragged himself from the rubble not at all appreciating the seriousness of his own injuries.

1351
01:59:10.14 --> 01:59:17.14
His radio operator followed stunned without the radio he was severely wounded and badly dazed.

1352
01:59:17.14 --> 01:59:27.14
He wandered off stumbling and babbling incoherently John called after him he started to run after him hobble after him actually.

1353
01:59:27.14 --> 01:59:36.14
He had only taken a few steps when an artillery round exploded nearby shredding the young man who'd served John so faithfully.

1354
01:59:36.14 --> 01:59:48.14
With no time to grieve major Duffy returned to his crumpled bunker to retrieve his radios.

1355
01:59:48.14 --> 01:59:53.14
So he about gets killed on that one.

1356
01:59:53.14 --> 01:59:59.14
He ends up being he was wounded five different five separate times during the battle.

1357
01:59:59.14 --> 02:00:06.14
This is probably a good time to talk about some of these books some of these poems that that major Duffy wrote.

1358
02:00:06.14 --> 02:00:14.14
He ended up writing he's written six books of poetry and one of the books as I mentioned earlier is called the battle for Charlie.

1359
02:00:14.14 --> 02:00:24.14
And and it's a chronological book of poems about what he experienced and I got one of the here's one of those poems that relates exactly to what happened.

1360
02:00:24.14 --> 02:00:39.14
The poem is called direct hit and it says the dust is choking the others are dead the radio still talks I must be alive.

1361
02:00:39.14 --> 02:00:44.14
The loud ringing noise will it ever stop.

1362
02:00:44.14 --> 02:00:48.14
I am half buried in someone else's grave.

1363
02:00:48.14 --> 02:00:50.14
My bunker is destroyed.

1364
02:00:50.14 --> 02:00:56.14
I crawl over the bodies all are dead or dying.

1365
02:00:56.14 --> 02:01:05.14
I must kill that gun.

1366
02:01:05.14 --> 02:01:12.14
That's probably his biggest frustration out of that battle is he could not silence those 130 millimeter guns.

1367
02:01:12.14 --> 02:01:14.14
They kept they kept firing.

1368
02:01:14.14 --> 02:01:15.14
Yeah.

1369
02:01:15.14 --> 02:01:23.14
And when you're talking about again these barrages that are 30 40 50 60 70 80 shells.

1370
02:01:23.14 --> 02:01:25.14
That's incomprehensible to me.

1371
02:01:25.14 --> 02:01:26.14
It really is.

1372
02:01:26.14 --> 02:01:37.14
It's just I can't even fathom what that must be like sitting in a foxhole with 30 or 40 or 50 of these explosions with the metal.

1373
02:01:37.14 --> 02:01:44.14
It's just it's insane to even think about.

1374
02:01:44.14 --> 02:01:49.14
So now we're going to April 13.

1375
02:01:49.14 --> 02:01:51.14
I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

1376
02:01:51.14 --> 02:02:00.14
And by the way you I'm fast forwarding past just about every page is filled with heroic insane combat.

1377
02:02:00.14 --> 02:02:02.14
Fast forward a little bit though.

1378
02:02:02.14 --> 02:02:05.14
Hi shook John Duffy awake in the middle of the night.

1379
02:02:05.14 --> 02:02:11.14
V.C. surround one one 13 they attack big hung need help.

1380
02:02:11.14 --> 02:02:17.14
And there's two there's two characters called hung skinny hung and big hung right.

1381
02:02:17.14 --> 02:02:20.14
They're both leaders in the companies.

1382
02:02:20.14 --> 02:02:23.14
John raised up on an elbow his head still pounded from his concussion.

1383
02:02:23.14 --> 02:02:25.14
He felt groggy and disoriented.

1384
02:02:25.14 --> 02:02:28.14
His thoughts not yet totally clear.

1385
02:02:28.14 --> 02:02:31.14
He ached in every inch of his being need to focus.

1386
02:02:31.14 --> 02:02:37.14
I went on hung here many hundred soldier move in the dark then attack.

1387
02:02:37.14 --> 02:02:40.14
He think big attack maybe hold battalion.

1388
02:02:40.14 --> 02:02:45.14
Duffy asked what time is it 0100 Christ one o'clock in the fucking morning.

1389
02:02:45.14 --> 02:02:49.14
Do you really think they're coming at him with a major attack in the middle of the night.

1390
02:02:49.14 --> 02:02:51.14
We hurt them in daytime yesterday.

1391
02:02:51.14 --> 02:02:55.14
Maybe try different tonight maybe so.

1392
02:02:55.14 --> 02:02:57.14
Okay let me see what I can do.

1393
02:02:57.14 --> 02:03:01.14
Can you request artillery flares be ready to go in case I'm able to get some tack air.

1394
02:03:01.14 --> 02:03:08.14
John got on his radio any Covey any Covey this is dusty cyanide need some help any Covey any Covey.

1395
02:03:08.14 --> 02:03:10.14
He was surprised by an immediate reply.

1396
02:03:10.14 --> 02:03:12.14
Hello dusty cyanide.

1397
02:03:12.14 --> 02:03:15.14
This is Covey 521.

1398
02:03:15.14 --> 02:03:22.14
And eventually that night he gets a specter on station AC 130.

1399
02:03:22.14 --> 02:03:30.14
God bless him gets them on and is able to prevent that attack from being overwhelming.

1400
02:03:30.14 --> 02:03:44.14
Fast forward a little bit Duffy moved about the hilltop with what many saw as reckless abandon the long radio antenna swaying over his head marked him as a target for major John Duffy though he was a man on a mission.

1401
02:03:44.14 --> 02:03:50.14
He had one purpose in life and that was to direct air strikes trying to save this battalion his battalion.

1402
02:03:50.14 --> 02:03:54.14
That was his task his duty nothing else mattered.

1403
02:03:54.14 --> 02:04:02.14
He jump in a trench work a target watch the fighters roll in and release their wardens then pick up and run to another trench for a better view of his next target.

1404
02:04:02.14 --> 02:04:12.14
Enemy gunners caught on to his strategy and open up on him as he ran shells bursting all around him.

1405
02:04:12.14 --> 02:04:16.14
So this is one of the things that you see throughout this battles.

1406
02:04:16.14 --> 02:04:23.14
He just he's doing whatever he needs to do to get in position where you can actually see and call him direct this fire in the most effective way.

1407
02:04:23.14 --> 02:04:24.14
Exactly.

1408
02:04:24.14 --> 02:04:35.14
And every time he does it he's putting his life at risk and seeing a big ass antenna on a guy that has no more primary target especially in this group then American with a radio on his back.

1409
02:04:35.14 --> 02:04:38.14
He's over what was he six foot three three.

1410
02:04:38.14 --> 02:04:39.14
Yeah.

1411
02:04:39.14 --> 02:04:48.14
Yeah. This guy had to be the most targeted human imaginable at this point.

1412
02:04:48.14 --> 02:04:49.14
They only see one American.

1413
02:04:49.14 --> 02:04:53.14
He's obviously the ones calling an airstrikes and he's running around like a maniac.

1414
02:04:53.14 --> 02:04:58.14
Well that's where I came up with the title for this book because we look at Duffy.

1415
02:04:58.14 --> 02:05:07.14
I mean he's the biggest hero of the battle but also may and high and these other guys and there's a lieutenant lap that's going to turn up in this too and Doc Lou and all of them.

1416
02:05:07.14 --> 02:05:21.14
It just is as I got into researching and writing the most extraordinary valor that I had seen and anything that I've that I've looked at that just really one hell of a fight.

1417
02:05:21.14 --> 02:05:24.14
Yeah. No it's like I said every page.

1418
02:05:24.14 --> 02:05:33.14
I mean I guess maybe this battle starts maybe page one 10 or one 15 or one 20 in the book but like every page after that.

1419
02:05:33.14 --> 02:05:39.14
There's there's a heroic scene.

1420
02:05:39.14 --> 02:05:43.14
Speaking of which Captain Skinny Hong had a hard fight in the saddle.

1421
02:05:43.14 --> 02:05:46.14
He pushed two platoons onto the LZ through stiff resistance.

1422
02:05:46.14 --> 02:05:49.14
A larger enemy force came out of the gully to meet him.

1423
02:05:49.14 --> 02:05:54.14
The 112 company struggled to hold but slowly gave ground a little after 2 p.m.

1424
02:05:54.14 --> 02:06:02.14
The NBA moved around their flank forcing hung to withdraw back inside Charlie to the LZ could not be retaken may grab the radio handset and put it back in.

1425
02:06:02.14 --> 02:06:06.14
Two flights of sky raiders on the saddle.

1426
02:06:06.14 --> 02:06:10.14
Major Leigh Van May had one last idea for salvation.

1427
02:06:10.14 --> 02:06:12.14
He summoned Lieutenant Thin.

1428
02:06:12.14 --> 02:06:17.14
Brother Thin I need you to take your company 111 to the East.

1429
02:06:17.14 --> 02:06:18.14
Those who can still fight.

1430
02:06:18.14 --> 02:06:21.14
I know your numbers are small but we have to do this.

1431
02:06:21.14 --> 02:06:22.14
Find a good spot.

1432
02:06:22.14 --> 02:06:23.14
Secure it.

1433
02:06:23.14 --> 02:06:24.14
Establish a new LZ.

1434
02:06:24.14 --> 02:06:26.14
We are running out of ammunition.

1435
02:06:26.14 --> 02:06:27.14
We need water.

1436
02:06:27.14 --> 02:06:28.14
We need food.

1437
02:06:28.14 --> 02:06:29.14
We need medical supplies.

1438
02:06:29.14 --> 02:06:31.14
We've got to get our wounded out.

1439
02:06:31.14 --> 02:06:35.14
Thin displayed his normal paratroop Brazil.

1440
02:06:35.14 --> 02:06:36.14
Yes sir.

1441
02:06:36.14 --> 02:06:37.14
We will get it done.

1442
02:06:41.14 --> 02:06:48.14
They're trying to establish another LZ because these LZ's that they've been trying to secure are just getting overwhelmed.

1443
02:06:48.14 --> 02:06:53.14
The the the NBA know that if they establish an LZ then they'll be able to get resupplied.

1444
02:06:53.14 --> 02:06:54.14
Right.

1445
02:06:54.14 --> 02:07:00.14
There's a you know a small battle that I hate to even say a small battle but they try and secure.

1446
02:07:00.14 --> 02:07:01.14
They try and secure it.

1447
02:07:01.14 --> 02:07:08.14
Get pushed back and finally may decides hey let's find an alternate landing zone somewhere.

1448
02:07:08.14 --> 02:07:19.14
Yeah maybe a little wider out to the east out there so move movies to get one and I would mention that Lieutenant Thin is one of May's favorite lieutenants favorite favorite commanders.

1449
02:07:19.14 --> 02:07:20.14
They're they're close.

1450
02:07:20.14 --> 02:07:29.14
Yeah and you go into their relationship in the book.

1451
02:07:29.14 --> 02:07:34.14
So they go out and I'm going to fast forward a little bit at dusk.

1452
02:07:34.14 --> 02:07:38.14
I saw the band of paratroopers returning from the east.

1453
02:07:38.14 --> 02:07:42.14
He rushed to the far side of the trench line waiting as the small group move closer.

1454
02:07:42.14 --> 02:07:50.14
He saw one 14 company soldiers mixed with the small band of one 11 company survivors.

1455
02:07:50.14 --> 02:07:56.14
All appeared wary but in good order carrying the wounded and dead may joined high.

1456
02:07:56.14 --> 02:07:59.14
They looked for Lieutenant Khan.

1457
02:07:59.14 --> 02:08:00.14
They didn't see him.

1458
02:08:00.14 --> 02:08:09.14
They didn't see any officers or sergeants from one 11 company may scan the bodies looking down at one.

1459
02:08:09.14 --> 02:08:10.14
He shuttered.

1460
02:08:10.14 --> 02:08:16.14
It was Lieutenant Thin his beloved Lieutenant Thin with emotion filling his voice.

1461
02:08:16.14 --> 02:08:20.14
One of the paratroopers reported to May lots of NVA.

1462
02:08:20.14 --> 02:08:23.14
We fought through and got to a good LZ site.

1463
02:08:23.14 --> 02:08:31.14
Then they hit us in force machine guns, mortars and recoil us rifles more than a hundred enemy.

1464
02:08:31.14 --> 02:08:34.14
We fought hard but couldn't hold them.

1465
02:08:34.14 --> 02:08:37.14
The NVA shot Lieutenant Thin in the head.

1466
02:08:37.14 --> 02:08:38.14
He's dead.

1467
02:08:38.14 --> 02:08:42.14
They killed Mr. Baugh and Lieutenant Khan and Sergeant Lung.

1468
02:08:42.14 --> 02:08:44.14
Others are dead too.

1469
02:08:44.14 --> 02:08:47.14
Many wounded.

1470
02:08:47.14 --> 02:08:52.14
The one 11 company was gone destroyed in battle between yesterday's fight on Hillman.

1471
02:08:52.14 --> 02:08:57.14
The day after day's fight on Hillman and the excursion to secure a new landing zone.

1472
02:08:57.14 --> 02:09:05.14
The enemy had killed all the officers and sergeants and whittled the unit down to a handful of effective fighters.

1473
02:09:05.14 --> 02:09:12.14
May placed those few still walking into the perimeter sector manned by headquarters company.

1474
02:09:12.14 --> 02:09:21.14
Soldiers stacked the dead on the growing rows of corpses and carried this severely wounded to the medical aid station where Doc Liu tended them as best he could.

1475
02:09:21.14 --> 02:09:24.14
Most medical supplies had run out.

1476
02:09:24.14 --> 02:09:34.14
The badly wounded lay there helpless and frustrated dealing with the agony of their pain and the guilt of not being further worth in the battle.

1477
02:09:34.14 --> 02:09:38.14
High in May found Duffy still working air strikes.

1478
02:09:38.14 --> 02:09:42.14
May told him there will be no new LZ.

1479
02:09:42.14 --> 02:09:44.14
NVA hit one 11 company hard.

1480
02:09:44.14 --> 02:09:46.14
Many casualties.

1481
02:09:46.14 --> 02:09:48.14
Tin is dead.

1482
02:09:48.14 --> 02:09:50.14
All officers and sergeants dead.

1483
02:09:50.14 --> 02:09:55.14
The news shocked Duffy but he remained resolute.

1484
02:09:55.14 --> 02:09:56.14
OK.

1485
02:09:56.14 --> 02:09:58.14
Then we fight with what we've got.

1486
02:09:58.14 --> 02:10:01.14
I'm going to rain air strikes down on the bastards.

1487
02:10:01.14 --> 02:10:02.14
Hi.

1488
02:10:02.14 --> 02:10:05.14
You will you do the same with VNF and already.

1489
02:10:05.14 --> 02:10:06.14
Yes, Duffy.

1490
02:10:06.14 --> 02:10:07.14
Good.

1491
02:10:07.14 --> 02:10:08.14
Let's get to it.

1492
02:10:08.14 --> 02:10:10.14
We've got some fighting to do.

1493
02:10:10.14 --> 02:10:12.14
Desperate.

1494
02:10:12.14 --> 02:10:14.14
It's a desperate situation.

1495
02:10:14.14 --> 02:10:16.14
Yeah, but they do.

1496
02:10:16.14 --> 02:10:18.14
You know, is it.

1497
02:10:18.14 --> 02:10:24.14
Duffy and May too may had a moment of.

1498
02:10:24.14 --> 02:10:25.14
I won't say despair.

1499
02:10:25.14 --> 02:10:26.14
That's too much.

1500
02:10:26.14 --> 02:10:29.14
But a moment where he was just doubting what was going on.

1501
02:10:29.14 --> 02:10:37.14
Duffy helped rally him and he came right back and stood as the rock of the battalion and Duffy is raining air strikes down.

1502
02:10:37.14 --> 02:10:39.14
And that's all that they could do.

1503
02:10:39.14 --> 02:10:40.14
I mean, that's their situation.

1504
02:10:40.14 --> 02:10:41.14
They've got their orders.

1505
02:10:41.14 --> 02:10:47.14
They've got the situation that they're in and they'll make the very best of it that they can.

1506
02:10:47.14 --> 02:10:49.14
And.

1507
02:10:49.14 --> 02:10:54.14
April 14, 1972.

1508
02:10:54.14 --> 02:10:57.14
Fighting continued through the night from time to time.

1509
02:10:57.14 --> 02:11:06.14
Friendly artillery flares drifted across the dark skies, swaying beneath tiny parachutes, lighting sections of the battlefield beneath them.

1510
02:11:06.14 --> 02:11:08.14
Shapes moved on the ground.

1511
02:11:08.14 --> 02:11:09.14
Paratroopers took care.

1512
02:11:09.14 --> 02:11:12.14
They only fired when they had sure targets well within range.

1513
02:11:12.14 --> 02:11:22.14
Each man cited carefully, breathed out and pulled the trigger with an oh so steady squeeze ammunition had become frighteningly scarce.

1514
02:11:22.14 --> 02:11:24.14
The North Vietnamese fired with much more abandoned.

1515
02:11:24.14 --> 02:11:25.14
They had ammo.

1516
02:11:25.14 --> 02:11:27.14
They were being resupplied.

1517
02:11:27.14 --> 02:11:36.14
The paratroopers were not.

1518
02:11:36.14 --> 02:11:39.14
The attacks come through the night.

1519
02:11:39.14 --> 02:11:42.14
A heavy barrage of enemy shelling shattered the morning calm.

1520
02:11:42.14 --> 02:11:46.14
Artillery, mortars, rockets and recoil-less rifles.

1521
02:11:46.14 --> 02:11:48.14
The rain of explosions didn't stop.

1522
02:11:48.14 --> 02:11:53.14
The battle for Charlie raged into its 12th day.

1523
02:11:53.14 --> 02:12:00.14
As he'd done so many times during the battle, John Duffy got up out of the trenches and braved exploding artillery to get a view of the enemy gun positions.

1524
02:12:00.14 --> 02:12:06.14
He moved to the edge of the perimeter, radio on his back with its recognizable antenna high over his head.

1525
02:12:06.14 --> 02:12:08.14
Enemy fire hit close by.

1526
02:12:08.14 --> 02:12:09.14
He moved.

1527
02:12:09.14 --> 02:12:10.14
More fire.

1528
02:12:10.14 --> 02:12:11.14
He moved again.

1529
02:12:11.14 --> 02:12:15.14
A North Vietnamese recoil-less rifle shell exploded in the ground beside him.

1530
02:12:15.14 --> 02:12:17.14
Fragments ripped into his left arm.

1531
02:12:17.14 --> 02:12:26.14
He put pressure on his wound to slow the bleeding and then grabbed his radio handset as a flight of US Army H1 Cobra attack helicopters checked in.

1532
02:12:26.14 --> 02:12:29.14
Dusty Sionide, this is Cougar 38.

1533
02:12:29.14 --> 02:12:32.14
Cougar 38, glad to have you on station.

1534
02:12:32.14 --> 02:12:35.14
I've got enemy troop movement along the finger to the south, southeast of Charlie.

1535
02:12:35.14 --> 02:12:37.14
Give me some runs there.

1536
02:12:37.14 --> 02:12:39.14
51 cow fire in the area.

1537
02:12:39.14 --> 02:12:41.14
If you see any, please engage.

1538
02:12:41.14 --> 02:12:47.14
The team of three Cobra gunships made several passes over the finger, expending all their ordnance.

1539
02:12:47.14 --> 02:12:52.14
They headed to Comtume for more fuel and ammunition.

1540
02:12:52.14 --> 02:12:53.14
Duffy watched them go.

1541
02:12:53.14 --> 02:12:55.14
What an awesome killing machine, he thought.

1542
02:12:55.14 --> 02:13:07.14
Cobra's carried 52 rockets on their stubby wings with 4,000 rounds of machine gun and 300 rounds of grenades and their movable nose turrets.

1543
02:13:07.14 --> 02:13:14.14
A few mounted a deadly 20 millimeter Vulcan Gatling gun with 950 high explosive rounds.

1544
02:13:14.14 --> 02:13:16.14
The Cougar flight called as they departed.

1545
02:13:16.14 --> 02:13:18.14
We'll be back, Dusty.

1546
02:13:18.14 --> 02:13:24.14
Another Covey, 534, came on station and worked more strikes against the several machine guns.

1547
02:13:24.14 --> 02:13:31.14
John identified trouble was when the fast jets dropped their bombs close to the gun positions, they only quieted them for a time.

1548
02:13:31.14 --> 02:13:35.14
Once the jets departed, the guns were soon back in operation.

1549
02:13:35.14 --> 02:13:38.14
Only a direct, direct hit really did the job.

1550
02:13:38.14 --> 02:13:52.14
John concluded that Cobra helicopters were the best in putting ordnance right into the gun pits and silencing the weapons for good.

1551
02:13:52.14 --> 02:13:55.14
Cobra's coming in hot.

1552
02:13:55.14 --> 02:13:57.14
Yeah, that's a heck of a duel.

1553
02:13:57.14 --> 02:14:03.14
Any Cobra pilot will tell you going against a 51 caliber is not a lot of fun at all.

1554
02:14:03.14 --> 02:14:07.14
They were deadly against helicopters and even Cobras.

1555
02:14:07.14 --> 02:14:16.14
And well, as you say, there's more in the book to be read, but I've got one account in there of one of our Cobras taking a 51 hit and the damage that it did.

1556
02:14:16.14 --> 02:14:19.14
Talk us through it.

1557
02:14:19.14 --> 02:14:29.14
Well, they were up, I think it was the day before, if I remember where I have it in there, but it was one of our Cobras up there and there was a 51.

1558
02:14:29.14 --> 02:14:33.14
They were going against a 51 and took a round through the front seat.

1559
02:14:33.14 --> 02:14:46.14
The front seater, Dave Mesa, was leaning over working his turret and the round came in just over his shoulder and would have hit him in the head or the chest if he'd been sitting up straight and not working his turret.

1560
02:14:46.14 --> 02:14:52.14
He went through the armor plate behind his seat and wounded the pilot in the back seat.

1561
02:14:52.14 --> 02:14:57.14
So they got the thing back over by the highway by the base where the second brigade was and landed.

1562
02:14:57.14 --> 02:15:07.14
The pilot was pulled out in medivac and Dave got to spend the night with the Vietnamese Airborne Brigade headquarters before he could get back to Placo the next day.

1563
02:15:07.14 --> 02:15:16.14
And there's a picture in the book of Dave standing there with the armor plate that they'd removed out of the seat. You can see the hole that the 51 caliber made in the aircraft.

1564
02:15:16.14 --> 02:15:20.14
It's a bad weapon for helicopters.

1565
02:15:20.14 --> 02:15:24.14
Yeah, the armor is not doing a ton of good against the 51 caliber.

1566
02:15:24.14 --> 02:15:26.14
No, small arms, it helps.

1567
02:15:26.14 --> 02:15:32.14
Of course, the Cobras in those days, the canopy was just plexiglass, so you got no protection from that.

1568
02:15:32.14 --> 02:15:38.14
But it did have armored seat and armor plate behind the seat that would give some protection from small arms.

1569
02:15:38.14 --> 02:15:43.14
Of course, the Apaches today are well suited to take all kinds of hits.

1570
02:15:43.14 --> 02:15:51.14
I flew Apaches the last six years of my Army career, but yeah, the Cobra could be damaged by 51 caliber.

1571
02:15:51.14 --> 02:16:02.14
Fast forward a little bit. The second Airborne Brigade hatched a plan for an emergency resupply. A Huey approached Charlie from altitude.

1572
02:16:02.14 --> 02:16:06.14
It flew high to minimize the risk from anti aircraft machine guns.

1573
02:16:06.14 --> 02:16:10.14
The paratroopers fixed their hopeful eyes on the drama above.

1574
02:16:10.14 --> 02:16:14.14
Once over, Charlie, streams of tracers stretched toward the chopper.

1575
02:16:14.14 --> 02:16:20.14
The crew kicked out well packed bundles of food, ammunition and medical supplies.

1576
02:16:20.14 --> 02:16:25.14
They missed the mark landing outside the perimeter. The enemy got to them in a flash.

1577
02:16:25.14 --> 02:16:38.14
They were desperate by this point. They bought out of ammo, no water for days, out of medical supplies. Very frustrating.

1578
02:16:38.14 --> 02:16:44.14
Fast forward a little bit more. Early afternoon, another flight of Cobras checked in.

1579
02:16:44.14 --> 02:16:50.14
Chief Warrant Officer Dan Jones flew lead. I piloted the second Cobra flying on his wing.

1580
02:16:50.14 --> 02:16:55.14
Fire Base Charlie, this is Panther 13. Panther lead, this is Dusty Sinai.

1581
02:16:55.14 --> 02:16:59.14
I have multiple targets for you. All 51 caliber machine guns.

1582
02:16:59.14 --> 02:17:02.14
So what are you thinking when you hear that?

1583
02:17:02.14 --> 02:17:08.14
Yeah, we've got our work cut out for us. Yeah, there's some trepidation.

1584
02:17:08.14 --> 02:17:14.14
Oh, shit. But then again, you get right back focused. We got to do what we can to help these guys.

1585
02:17:14.14 --> 02:17:17.14
John Duffey and I, as I said, we've talked a number of times since.

1586
02:17:17.14 --> 02:17:22.14
And I have always, as I do to all the special forces guys that are down there that were supporting,

1587
02:17:22.14 --> 02:17:25.14
I said, oh, you guys are just hanging it all out down there on the ground.

1588
02:17:25.14 --> 02:17:27.14
I'm sure glad I'm in a helicopter.

1589
02:17:27.14 --> 02:17:34.14
Don, John has said every single time, I'm glad I wasn't in that helicopter and I'm glad I was on the ground.

1590
02:17:34.14 --> 02:17:40.14
You guys have no you're up there with this little tinfoil around you taking all these rounds getting shot right at you.

1591
02:17:40.14 --> 02:17:42.14
There's no way I would want to do that.

1592
02:17:42.14 --> 02:17:52.14
Okay, John, I understand that I still have tremendous respect for you on the ground and I would not would not want to be there.

1593
02:17:52.14 --> 02:17:57.14
The crews knew the risk 51 caliber machine guns seem designed specifically to shoot down helicopters.

1594
02:17:57.14 --> 02:18:00.14
They done plenty of damage over the past weeks.

1595
02:18:00.14 --> 02:18:04.14
Panther one three calmly acknowledged rather Roger Dusty cyanide.

1596
02:18:04.14 --> 02:18:06.14
We're inbound give us a position to get there.

1597
02:18:06.14 --> 02:18:13.14
The Cobras made several attacks on enemy guns bullets streamed past their cockpits as the NBA gunners tried to bring them down.

1598
02:18:13.14 --> 02:18:18.14
Attack helicopter pilots knew that rolling in on a 51 position was always dicey.

1599
02:18:18.14 --> 02:18:21.14
Tracers came at them and missed by a few feet.

1600
02:18:21.14 --> 02:18:26.14
Pilots tried to get rockets onto the machine guns before the enemy got lucky and blasted them out of the sky.

1601
02:18:26.14 --> 02:18:32.14
The pilots held steady focusing on controlling their helicopters lining up the gun sites and shooting.

1602
02:18:32.14 --> 02:18:39.14
Panther one three fire team took small arms hits but kept running at their targets again and again and again.

1603
02:18:39.14 --> 02:18:44.14
John Duffy observed throughout the shootout taking it all in commenting to himself.

1604
02:18:44.14 --> 02:18:49.14
They're coming in out of the sun going in going for the high gun first.

1605
02:18:49.14 --> 02:18:53.14
That's good shit green and red tracers crossing in front of them.

1606
02:18:53.14 --> 02:18:58.14
They're taking fire from everywhere. There they punched off a salvo of rockets right on target.

1607
02:18:58.14 --> 02:19:03.14
The gunners were surely blown up in that explosion wingman rolling in on the second gun.

1608
02:19:03.14 --> 02:19:07.14
They're keeping at it. It's a dance of death. I love those guys.

1609
02:19:07.14 --> 02:19:11.14
Bad ass Cobra pilots so steady under such heavy fire.

1610
02:19:11.14 --> 02:19:15.14
God I'm glad I'm on the ground.

1611
02:19:15.14 --> 02:19:21.14
The Panther lead radioed Dusty cyanide Panther one three be advised running low on fuel out of ammo.

1612
02:19:21.14 --> 02:19:24.14
We're breaking station for rearm refuel.

1613
02:19:24.14 --> 02:19:30.14
Roger one three four gun crews destroyed four guns taken out good work.

1614
02:19:30.14 --> 02:19:34.14
Hurry back.

1615
02:19:34.14 --> 02:19:38.14
How long are you on station for in that scenario is that like five minutes.

1616
02:19:38.14 --> 02:19:43.14
Oh it's more than it is probably 15 minutes or so.

1617
02:19:43.14 --> 02:19:45.14
Number of runs.

1618
02:19:45.14 --> 02:19:48.14
How can you tell when you're getting shot at it's because you're seeing tracers.

1619
02:19:48.14 --> 02:19:52.14
Yeah you can you see trace sometimes you see tracers sometimes you don't.

1620
02:19:52.14 --> 02:20:01.14
That first tour when I got shot down the Mohawk by a 37 millimeter anti aircraft I didn't see anything until my whole right wing exploded so I didn't even see any tracers.

1621
02:20:01.14 --> 02:20:05.14
But yeah we'd 51s you routinely see tracers.

1622
02:20:05.14 --> 02:20:12.14
Now we in the SEAL teams we would say tracers work both ways so you can tell where you're shooting but people can also tell you where you're shooting from.

1623
02:20:12.14 --> 02:20:16.14
Is it when you see tracers can you start to track them back to where the gun is.

1624
02:20:16.14 --> 02:20:21.14
Yeah in fact that's how we'd see where the gun position is where the tracers are coming from.

1625
02:20:21.14 --> 02:20:24.14
Is it better to be lead burger wingman.

1626
02:20:24.14 --> 02:20:26.14
I don't know that it much matters.

1627
02:20:26.14 --> 02:20:34.14
I mean on the first run it's probably better to be lead because they may not see or know you're coming until you're rolling and start shooting and then they're ready for number two.

1628
02:20:34.14 --> 02:20:43.14
But once you make more than one run and we've made several runs that day on different positions and they know well that you're there and they're trying to get you.

1629
02:20:43.14 --> 02:20:46.14
So what's your speed that makes you safe.

1630
02:20:46.14 --> 02:20:51.14
Like what are you doing to increase your survivability.

1631
02:20:51.14 --> 02:20:53.14
Shooting.

1632
02:20:53.14 --> 02:20:57.14
Yeah I don't think it's speed in a helicopter it's just luck.

1633
02:20:57.14 --> 02:21:00.14
I mean they can't get right at you that first time.

1634
02:21:00.14 --> 02:21:02.14
Most of the time they can't.

1635
02:21:02.14 --> 02:21:09.14
Now when I was shot down and captured those were 51 calibers too and maybe a couple things larger and there were several weapons positions engaged me at the same time.

1636
02:21:09.14 --> 02:21:13.14
And I saw tracers all around the cockpit and then we started taking hits.

1637
02:21:13.14 --> 02:21:18.14
So it's just I think it's difficult for them to get that first round right on you.

1638
02:21:18.14 --> 02:21:25.14
And so hopefully you can get some rockets on him before he gets his aim close enough where he can bring out of the sky.

1639
02:21:25.14 --> 02:21:29.14
It's not a desired target a cobra against a 51 is not desired.

1640
02:21:29.14 --> 02:21:33.14
It has to be we wouldn't just go out looking for 51 positions to engage.

1641
02:21:33.14 --> 02:21:37.14
In fact if we were just out on a mission we saw some 51s probably turn it over to a fact or whatever.

1642
02:21:37.14 --> 02:21:40.14
And we just get out of the area.

1643
02:21:40.14 --> 02:21:45.14
But in this case you know there were lives on the line and we had to do what we could do to help.

1644
02:21:45.14 --> 02:22:00.14
Luckily we got through it OK and not taking any 51 hits as I pointed out that other Panther flight did take 51 hits.

1645
02:22:00.14 --> 02:22:10.14
What does it look like because I had the experience where I was up in Fallon Nevada and we were doing training with the helicopter squadrons.

1646
02:22:10.14 --> 02:22:15.14
And it was I was in my first to seal to it so I wasn't didn't know what I was doing.

1647
02:22:15.14 --> 02:22:19.14
And I was calling in a helicopter to pick us up my squad.

1648
02:22:19.14 --> 02:22:24.14
We were on a training mission and I was calling them in to pick us up and it's the desert.

1649
02:22:24.14 --> 02:22:29.14
And I'm standing there kind of standing up and I'm calling this aircraft and this helicopters.

1650
02:22:29.14 --> 02:22:33.14
I think there's I think it's so obvious where we are.

1651
02:22:33.14 --> 02:22:38.14
And I said hey you know I'm right here you know go ahead and put it down to our West and he's I got on see you.

1652
02:22:38.14 --> 02:22:45.14
And I mean if you if I would have had to bet money I would have bet months paycheck that this guy easily saw.

1653
02:22:45.14 --> 02:22:53.14
He couldn't see us at all because what I didn't realize at the time as a young seals he's looking at you know many many many square miles of stuff.

1654
02:22:53.14 --> 02:22:57.14
And I'm just looking up at the sky at one or two helicopters so it's real obvious.

1655
02:22:57.14 --> 02:23:04.14
When you're overhead in the in the in this situation can you see the friendly forces.

1656
02:23:04.14 --> 02:23:11.14
Can you can you get an idea where John Duffy is are you close enough to the ground to see the guy's expressions like what's it like from that perspective.

1657
02:23:11.14 --> 02:23:13.14
You can see guys on the ground.

1658
02:23:13.14 --> 02:23:26.14
Can you tell who's who can you tell no friendly from no not usually I mean if you get low enough and close enough and can pay enough attention and you can because the NBA are mostly wearing either green or tan uniforms a little bit.

1659
02:23:26.14 --> 02:23:32.14
Different and a lot of them have pith helmets on and some regular be you can.

1660
02:23:32.14 --> 02:23:38.14
But as you said it's difficult to focus your view exactly where you need to focus your view.

1661
02:23:38.14 --> 02:23:48.14
And so when John was working with us as guns he's not so much at least in that situation going against the guns he's not so much describing where he is exactly.

1662
02:23:48.14 --> 02:24:02.14
He's describing where the weapons positions are so he's keying that off of various pieces of training you see that ridges he that knuckle that that direction and and there and then you know eventually we get the tracers coming up so we can see it.

1663
02:24:02.14 --> 02:24:08.14
Now later when we come back he is trying to describe his position to us of course it was dark then and we couldn't see him.

1664
02:24:08.14 --> 02:24:12.14
We could see fires and adjust.

1665
02:24:12.14 --> 02:24:28.14
Routinely to take that back a little bit when we're extracting special forces teams out of the jungle they would describe to us where they were and all and we could generally see them on the ground unless they were hidden by the jungle canopy so we could we could pick them out.

1666
02:24:28.14 --> 02:24:40.14
So yeah the long answer the question I can fully understand your situation a Fallon where you say hey guys we're down here we see you and we're up you know I don't know what altitude they were but anywhere from several hundred feet up to maybe a thousand or two thousand feet.

1667
02:24:40.14 --> 02:24:46.14
They're looking out and especially Fallon over an expanse of desert as far as they can see.

1668
02:24:46.14 --> 02:25:01.14
And OK where are you so that you need some focus and I had the aircraft panel so it inside my floppy hat and I thought oh I'm such a pro I'll just break out my fly you know this little orange whatever six inch square.

1669
02:25:01.14 --> 02:25:05.14
Can you see me now the guys like you're an idiot.

1670
02:25:05.14 --> 02:25:10.14
Now what does work and is helpful is is flashy.

1671
02:25:10.14 --> 02:25:14.14
We can see the mirror you can see exactly OK that's where that guy is I see his mirror.

1672
02:25:14.14 --> 02:25:23.14
And we do that with the teams we pick up use mirrors or if the jungle is too thick for mirror they'd get us close by describing where their position was and then they just pop smoke.

1673
02:25:23.14 --> 02:25:28.14
And then you say OK I see orange smoke or whatever yeah that's us and you have their position exactly.

1674
02:25:28.14 --> 02:25:32.14
Yeah and Duffy ends up using a mirror in this.

1675
02:25:32.14 --> 02:25:45.14
All right going back to the book fast forward a little airstrikes continued other teams of Cobras worked VN AF A1 Sky Raiders and US jet fighters drop more napalm and high explosive bombs on the advancing enemy as well.

1676
02:25:45.14 --> 02:25:55.14
Even so the NBA attack intensified pressuring the South Vietnamese defenders the enemy overran security outpost they pushed into the perimeter of Charlie to itself.

1677
02:25:55.14 --> 02:26:06.14
Human waves of NVA came forward shouting surrender you'll live fight back you'll die but the paratroopers fought vigorously picking up the closest targets aiming and shooting.

1678
02:26:06.14 --> 02:26:24.14
Hold the trenches don't fall back fire shoot those guys over there chaos ruled the front it became an inferno of smoke dust flame and noise the world convulsed in a crescendo of crackling cracking gunfire and deafening explosions of artillery.

1679
02:26:24.14 --> 02:26:37.14
The wine of attacking aircraft the thunderous boom of their bombs and the sucking roar of the napalm they dropped paratroopers fought with all they had they fought with grit and determination they fought for their buddies in the pride of the 11th airborne.

1680
02:26:37.14 --> 02:26:50.14
They fought inspired by those Vietnamese paratroopers who had gone before those who had sacrificed so much in historic battles of old they fought until their bullets were gone after that they turned to grenades and knives.

1681
02:26:50.14 --> 02:26:56.14
Many died swinging their empty rifles as clubs.

1682
02:26:56.14 --> 02:27:09.14
The brave paratroopers withstood the onslaught with fierce determination still their enemy pushed taking patches of earth inch by inch paying dearly for every small gain.

1683
02:27:09.14 --> 02:27:24.14
Finally the NVA overran Charlie's Southwest perimeter they occupied much of one one 14 companies defensive position and pause to catch their breath among the mingle dead of both sides.

1684
02:27:24.14 --> 02:27:29.14
Duffy got on the radio to major Peter comma at second brigade.

1685
02:27:29.14 --> 02:27:40.14
Seller five one seller five one this is dusty cyanide prairie fire prairie fire prairie fire I am declaring a prairie fire emergency we are being overrun.

1686
02:27:40.14 --> 02:27:54.14
John defaulted to a phrase familiar to him from his earlier special forces work behind enemy lines in Laos prairie fire meant a special operations team was about to be overrun and all available assets were brought to bear.

1687
02:27:54.14 --> 02:28:07.14
Peter comma knew what John needed and translated the statement into his into words more commonly understood by conventional military forces he declared a tactical emergency or tacky across all of to core.

1688
02:28:07.14 --> 02:28:18.14
This required every available asset to be redirected to support the paratroopers on fire base Charlie John Duffy would now get everything flying in the skies over central South Vietnam.

1689
02:28:18.14 --> 02:28:29.14
John may and high got busier than they ever had been working flight after flight of supporting aircraft.

1690
02:28:29.14 --> 02:28:31.14
Prairie fire emergency.

1691
02:28:31.14 --> 02:28:32.14
Yep.

1692
02:28:32.14 --> 02:28:46.14
And this is the end is coming and it is pretty amazing with all the firepower that they had at their disposal how determined the NVA were to carry this attack to its to fruition.

1693
02:28:46.14 --> 02:29:02.14
As they just kept pouring battalion after battalion in there until they carried the day but they suffered horrendous casualties which we talk about the impact of that as we get at the at the end of the book.

1694
02:29:02.14 --> 02:29:05.14
Fast forward a little bit.

1695
02:29:05.14 --> 02:29:10.14
The enemy delayed only a short while before getting back up and continuing their assault.

1696
02:29:10.14 --> 02:29:13.14
They were about to overrun the 11th battalion.

1697
02:29:13.14 --> 02:29:15.14
Dusty cyanide this is Cougar 38 inbound.

1698
02:29:15.14 --> 02:29:23.14
Welcome back 38 enemy advancing rapidly from the West and Southwest battalion strength heaviest from the Southwest expand on that formation.

1699
02:29:23.14 --> 02:29:26.14
Roger Dusty will give them hell.

1700
02:29:26.14 --> 02:29:29.14
And again it's incredible you can hear some of these calls.

1701
02:29:29.14 --> 02:29:38.14
I listened to these calls Cougar 38 and and and Duffy just sounds calm cool and collected.

1702
02:29:38.14 --> 02:29:45.14
It's hard to hear him sometimes but when you do hear him it's like they're talking about you know past me the catch up.

1703
02:29:45.14 --> 02:29:46.14
Yeah.

1704
02:29:46.14 --> 02:30:00.14
Well because he knows to survive he has to be you can't you can't get in the panic and start screaming and hollering on the radio and nobody's going to understand what you're saying or what you need so to survive he has to stay calm and measured.

1705
02:30:00.14 --> 02:30:06.14
Cougar 38 heavy fire team of three Cobras came in from the Northeast they drew intense enemy aircraft fire.

1706
02:30:06.14 --> 02:30:14.14
Enemy anti aircraft fire dropping to just above the trees to minimize their exposure they flew past Duffy in May then continued right into the face of the attack.

1707
02:30:14.14 --> 02:30:23.14
Duffy commented what guts those guys have never seen anything like it right on the deck those crazy bastards are going to kill themselves to save us God damn heroes.

1708
02:30:23.14 --> 02:30:32.14
Each aircraft fired its entire ammunition load on one pass pilots launching pairs of rockets as fast as their fingers could press the firing button.

1709
02:30:32.14 --> 02:30:37.14
Front seat gunners working their turret weapon incessantly reigning death and destruction.

1710
02:30:37.14 --> 02:30:44.14
They annihilated the breadth of the attacking formation the enemy staggered he stumbled he fell he pulled back.

1711
02:30:44.14 --> 02:30:54.14
Needing to regroup once again the courage of those three Cobra crews stalled the NBA attack for now there was no doubt the resolute enemy would come again.

1712
02:30:54.14 --> 02:31:03.14
May needed his other company he ordered them to consolidate hours ago where were they he called 113 company again.

1713
02:31:03.14 --> 02:31:14.14
403 what's your progress big hung responded we're trying lots of enemy around us may sternly order to break through and get down here do it now we need the battalion together.

1714
02:31:14.14 --> 02:31:16.14
Roger.

1715
02:31:16.14 --> 02:31:18.14
May frowned and frustration.

1716
02:31:18.14 --> 02:31:28.14
High used the temporary lull to move about and assess the situation he ran quickly among the defenders by then compressed into a much smaller circle.

1717
02:31:28.14 --> 02:31:34.14
They had something over 100 effective fighters left of the 471 man battalion.

1718
02:31:34.14 --> 02:31:42.14
High moved from position to position utilizing trenches as much as possible but at times dashing into the open from Foxhole to Foxhole.

1719
02:31:42.14 --> 02:31:49.14
He spent a few minutes talking to each leader and spoke with paratroopers along the way bolstering their will to fight by whatever means remained.

1720
02:31:49.14 --> 02:32:01.14
High finished his circuit and rejoined May in the command post trench dusk settled in may called Duffy who joined them there blood seeped from a gash and John's right shoulder.

1721
02:32:01.14 --> 02:32:06.14
He'd been hit yet another yet again by another shell fragment.

1722
02:32:06.14 --> 02:32:12.14
High shook his head and began his report we in bad shape many dead more wounded.

1723
02:32:12.14 --> 02:32:22.14
I count only a little over 100 still can fight most them hurt not much ammunition some have no ammo even after take from dead.

1724
02:32:22.14 --> 02:32:29.14
No way to stop next attack next attack and 11th battalion.

1725
02:32:29.14 --> 02:32:40.14
May look straight and highs I for eyes for a time studying him digesting what he just said he turned to Duffy ready to speak but paused both minds turned through options.

1726
02:32:40.14 --> 02:32:53.14
High spoke again casualty high ammo run thin cannot stop VC most of battalion dead we stay longer all die should leave.

1727
02:32:53.14 --> 02:33:02.14
He leaned close to me and spoken Vietnamese gotta get this gotta get the battalion off this fucking hill before the enemy comes again.

1728
02:33:02.14 --> 02:33:07.14
May not it and responded in English yes we order withdraw.

1729
02:33:07.14 --> 02:33:10.14
Duffy had a plan.

1730
02:33:10.14 --> 02:33:14.14
He'd risk his life to try and save what was left of the battalion.

1731
02:33:14.14 --> 02:33:18.14
It seemed insane but it made perfect sense to him.

1732
02:33:18.14 --> 02:33:25.14
I will stay and try to delay the NVA maybe we'll get some more air and time to make a difference.

1733
02:33:25.14 --> 02:33:33.14
May insisted I stay with you we team American and Vietnamese we fight together.

1734
02:33:33.14 --> 02:33:37.14
John not it full of determined grit.

1735
02:33:37.14 --> 02:33:47.14
John Duffy and lay van may would form a two man rear guard to allow what was left of the battalion to break contact and escape.

1736
02:33:47.14 --> 02:33:55.14
Two men against two enemy battalions may face his operations officer with a look of resignation.

1737
02:33:55.14 --> 02:34:01.14
You lead the battalion off Charlie high major Duffy and I will delay as long as we can.

1738
02:34:01.14 --> 02:34:08.14
We're your rear guard go about 800 meters northeast and wait for 113 company.

1739
02:34:08.14 --> 02:34:16.14
I'll tell big hung to move east until he finds you 113 is in good shape they have ammo and only a few casualties you'll be okay.

1740
02:34:16.14 --> 02:34:24.14
High saluted high saluted responding smartly yes sir we go.

1741
02:34:24.14 --> 02:34:30.14
He rallied the surviving paratroopers those who could walk helped others who couldn't.

1742
02:34:30.14 --> 02:34:39.14
High led the way off the hilltop toward the sanctuary of the jungle below.

1743
02:34:39.14 --> 02:34:47.14
Excuse me slow emotional listening to read all that.

1744
02:34:47.14 --> 02:34:53.14
Yeah so that is the most heroic part of the whole and there's heroism throughout the book.

1745
02:34:53.14 --> 02:35:03.14
But that is the most extraordinary act of the whole story is John Duffy and lay van may deciding to be a rear guard.

1746
02:35:03.14 --> 02:35:19.14
You know not knowing what their chances of survival would be and it looked pretty bleak but to do that to allow the rest of the battalion to try to withdraw and get off the hill and survive.

1747
02:35:19.14 --> 02:35:24.14
So yeah I don't know what they thought their chances were of survival.

1748
02:35:24.14 --> 02:35:36.14
I mean they're here they are getting crushed for 11 days at this point 12 days at this point couple weeks the end the NBA has is fighting like they've never seen him fight before.

1749
02:35:36.14 --> 02:35:42.14
They keep coming wave after wave after wave the NBA has ammo the NBA has resupply.

1750
02:35:42.14 --> 02:35:52.14
And has that artillery pounding and yeah the aircraft and you know some some would say hey guys you had the order to fight to the death what the hell you doing with drawing off the hill.

1751
02:35:52.14 --> 02:36:01.14
They had no further means to resist they were just down to a few bullets left and guys swinging their weapons to fight the enemy.

1752
02:36:01.14 --> 02:36:09.14
So I think I was exactly right the next wave of attack from the NBA would have just killed killed all of them and not accomplish anything.

1753
02:36:09.14 --> 02:36:22.14
So the decision was made to withdraw the survivors that they had which at that point were just over a hundred people out of a 471 man battalion to go ahead and try and get those guys off off the hill.

1754
02:36:22.14 --> 02:36:27.14
So there's two of them left.

1755
02:36:27.14 --> 02:36:33.14
As dust turned to darkness a strange silence brought a chill.

1756
02:36:33.14 --> 02:36:39.14
It was as if May and Duffy were in the eye of a storm.

1757
02:36:39.14 --> 02:36:45.14
The enemy had fallen back for the moment the artillery and mortars fell still their battalion had gone.

1758
02:36:45.14 --> 02:36:51.14
There was no chatter on the radio not a sound on the hilltop save the whimpers of the dying.

1759
02:36:51.14 --> 02:37:02.14
They sat alone on the edge of what had been fire based Charlie waiting warily for their enemies next move not doubting for a moment he would attack.

1760
02:37:02.14 --> 02:37:04.14
It was dark.

1761
02:37:04.14 --> 02:37:16.14
Suddenly the silence broke whistling projectiles hurled through the air incoming enemy artillery erupted across the hilltop one shell burst not far to their front.

1762
02:37:16.14 --> 02:37:26.14
The explosion rocked them the blast deafening the night for an instant it lit their dirty blood smeared faces their hollow eyes set in hopeless determination.

1763
02:37:26.14 --> 02:37:38.14
A few more shells crashed around them none as close as the first each blinding flash shown upon the corpses lying across the battlefield gruesome evidence of the fight that had raged over the past days.

1764
02:37:38.14 --> 02:37:50.14
Hundreds lay dead over the hilltop outpost the bodies of South Vietnamese paratroopers mixed with those of their determined North Vietnamese enemy.

1765
02:37:50.14 --> 02:38:01.14
The explosion stopped the dark returned only the moans of the wounded pierced the silence of the night the stench of death filled the nostrils of the last two men fighting.

1766
02:38:01.14 --> 02:38:05.14
Smoke choked their lungs they waited in anticipation.

1767
02:38:05.14 --> 02:38:14.14
They heard orders shouted from across the field they sensed movement as another attack wave swept toward them.

1768
02:38:14.14 --> 02:38:22.14
The American advisor leaned close to his Vietnamese counterpart and exclaimed shit here they come again.

1769
02:38:22.14 --> 02:38:32.14
The reply in broken but well practiced English was resolute I know we fight we fight more.

1770
02:38:32.14 --> 02:38:43.14
The enemy once again rose from the darkness tearing through the night coming at them as vague shapes screaming and shooting throwing grenades as they advanced closer and closer still both John Duffy and

1771
02:38:43.14 --> 02:38:55.14
Le Van May knew this was the final assault bullets whizzed by them a grenade exploded ripping a hole in May's chest he gasped for air.

1772
02:38:55.14 --> 02:39:09.14
Duffy already wounded several times himself looked over his left shoulder he nodded satisfied seeing the decimated force all that was left of the once mighty 11th Airborne Battalion escaping down the hillside.

1773
02:39:09.14 --> 02:39:17.14
John and May were all that stood between the remnants of the battalion and their annihilation.

1774
02:39:17.14 --> 02:39:30.14
They've been out of food for days they had no water left in their canteens their ammunition was nearly gone but still the Americans and the American in his south Vietnamese comrade fought and still the enemy came there was no talk of surrender

1775
02:39:30.14 --> 02:39:39.14
no thought but to kill as many as they could before they were themselves cut down where they squatted on the edge of the air of their abandoned positions.

1776
02:39:39.14 --> 02:39:44.14
Le Van May strained to speak fight Duffy fight.

1777
02:39:44.14 --> 02:39:51.14
They battled with everything that remained in their hearts and souls but the end of their road was only minutes away.

1778
02:39:51.14 --> 02:39:54.14
They knew they were about to die.

1779
02:39:54.14 --> 02:40:09.14
John Duffy sensed his mortality as words of welled in his soul deaths moment is near I can feel its flame soon it will be here it seems strange no more.

1780
02:40:09.14 --> 02:40:17.14
Duffy's radio crackled dusty cyanide this is Panther one three back with you Duffy looked at May hot damn.

1781
02:40:17.14 --> 02:40:27.14
He grabbed his radio handset Roger Panther welcome back dusty where inbound with rockets 40 Mike Mike and minigun thought you might need a little more help.

1782
02:40:27.14 --> 02:40:40.14
Through the blackness the Cobra crews saw fires and chaos on Charlie they could only imagine the desperate situation on the ground.

1783
02:40:40.14 --> 02:40:46.14
Duffy radio the Cobras enemy broken broken through on the Southwest Charlie overrun.

1784
02:40:46.14 --> 02:40:57.14
There are three prominent fires on the hilltop one big and two small the large one is on the Southwest part of the base you see one small fire short distance north and another 100 meters east of that.

1785
02:40:57.14 --> 02:41:07.14
We are on the North edge of that Eastern small fire need you to shoot right in front of us just to our west but real close Roger dusty we got him.

1786
02:41:07.14 --> 02:41:12.14
The Cobras rolled in firing Duffy adjusted their good runs closer.

1787
02:41:12.14 --> 02:41:23.14
The attacking enemy was about on top of them he cut down several with his car 15 made the same with his M16 but that didn't slow them down a bit the enemy was still charging just feet away.

1788
02:41:23.14 --> 02:41:40.14
As the pink Panthers began another gun run the head of the closest soldier exploded hit by a 40 millimeter grenade from one of the Cobras his reflexes kept his legs moving for a step or two before he crumbled to the ground so close that blood and tissue splattered on Duffy and May.

1789
02:41:40.14 --> 02:41:43.14
Right there Panther keep it up.

1790
02:41:43.14 --> 02:42:01.14
The Cobras kept it up Duffy delighted in the hot shell cases raining down from above after a number of attack runs Duffy called Panther Panther lead this is dusty cyanide you have broken the enemy attack for now hundreds of bodies on the field maybe 1000 but we cannot hold.

1791
02:42:01.14 --> 02:42:14.14
After a short break he continued we are leaving fire base Charlie now stop them from following us whatever it takes put your stuff all over the hilltop now.

1792
02:42:14.14 --> 02:42:25.14
The two ran for their lives may first followed by Duffy US Army Special Forces Major John Joseph Duffy was the last to leave fire base Charlie.

1793
02:42:25.14 --> 02:42:34.14
Another Cobra flight joined the team with Lieutenant Forrest Snyder in one of the front seats that gave Panther one three a heavy team of four aircraft.

1794
02:42:34.14 --> 02:42:43.14
Forrest was the best gunner the Panthers had the team fired everything they had at the hill that had been fire based Charlie they turned toward home.

1795
02:42:43.14 --> 02:42:59.14
The flight picked its way through the mountains and valleys below a worsening layer of scud clouds and a pitch black of night what was left of the 11th Airborne Battalion move toward the refuge of the valley below.

1796
02:42:59.14 --> 02:43:05.14
That was the end of the fight on fire base Charlie.

1797
02:43:05.14 --> 02:43:13.14
Yeah and I you know I flew that I was Panther one three was Dan Jones and lead and I was Panther three six flying his wing.

1798
02:43:13.14 --> 02:43:27.14
We knew it was a bad situation at the time and we did all we could to help but we had no real full appreciation of everything that was going on down there until I've got all this information together to write the book.

1799
02:43:27.14 --> 02:43:48.14
John Duffy. Well he credits his life to several things including Cougar three eight that came in there that day but he said that that night he is and Le Van May the same thing they are alive today because of what we were able to do for them which was just doing what we could to help.

1800
02:43:48.14 --> 02:43:52.14
So you're flying and this was this was in pure darkness.

1801
02:43:52.14 --> 02:43:58.14
Yeah we got there that second run was night it was dark and clearly you guys don't have night vision at the time.

1802
02:43:58.14 --> 02:44:01.14
So it is you're looking at blackness.

1803
02:44:01.14 --> 02:44:07.14
Yeah it was it was awfully dark the weather was not good and getting worse and we could see the fires on the hilltop.

1804
02:44:07.14 --> 02:44:16.14
And yeah we're out there doing what we can do in that situation and it was Duffy's description of those fires and where he was in relation to those fires.

1805
02:44:16.14 --> 02:44:31.14
And we just put our rounds down and as Dan Jones recently commented to me he said hey we weren't exactly sure of how close we were shooting to him we couldn't see him we could see the fire and he was just off the edge of one of the fires.

1806
02:44:31.14 --> 02:44:42.14
So it was just by the grace of God we were able to get those rounds right where they needed to be and then move them a little bit as he would give us adjustments and that as close as we were firing to him.

1807
02:44:42.14 --> 02:44:51.14
Particularly the Rockets Rockets is not those 2.75 Rockets are not a point fire weapons not like the hellfire and tow missiles that we've had since.

1808
02:44:51.14 --> 02:45:06.14
So lucky that we could get them close enough to be doing the good that needed to get done and not inadvertently do damage to those guys and we could have blown Duffy and may off the map if we'd have been just a few feet off of where we were putting our putting our rounds.

1809
02:45:06.14 --> 02:45:16.14
And John Duffy says this day one of the most glorious feelings he's had in his life is feeling hot brass rain down on top of him.

1810
02:45:16.14 --> 02:45:25.14
Can you can you see the targets at all. Are you shooting this based on hey 50 meters in front of the fire to the east.

1811
02:45:25.14 --> 02:45:32.14
No we couldn't see any people at all just the fires and where our rounds were hitting and exploding.

1812
02:45:32.14 --> 02:45:39.14
And because there's no there's no like overhead artillery putting a loom up or anything it's just dark just dark.

1813
02:45:39.14 --> 02:45:43.14
How long were you on station for.

1814
02:45:43.14 --> 02:45:47.14
After the other flight came in that I don't you know it's hard to say.

1815
02:45:47.14 --> 02:45:57.14
I don't know I guess to be the best answer but I would imagine like 10 15 minutes 20 minutes at the most 15 20 yeah 20 at the most 10 to 15 probably.

1816
02:45:57.14 --> 02:46:08.14
Because we got there we made multiple runs the other fire team showed up and joined with us and they were fresh on ordinance everything so they had a lot more to put down on the hilltop.

1817
02:46:08.14 --> 02:46:15.14
Maybe 20 minutes probably closer to 15.

1818
02:46:15.14 --> 02:46:25.14
You know those cheesy action movies where there's like the hero is barely getting away as you know as the explosion happens like.

1819
02:46:25.14 --> 02:46:31.14
But it doesn't actually happen in real life except for it happens here.

1820
02:46:31.14 --> 02:46:39.14
After this insane moment of hot damn the Cobras are here to bail us out.

1821
02:46:39.14 --> 02:46:43.14
John and may stumbled and fell through the darkness moving.

1822
02:46:43.14 --> 02:46:57.14
Quickly in spite of their painful injuries once the North Vietnamese had taken the hill the enemy advanced halted for the moment the attackers to devastated to continue the Cobras and save the day.

1823
02:46:57.14 --> 02:47:00.14
Amazingly Duffy and may were still alive.

1824
02:47:00.14 --> 02:47:11.14
They started out again Duffy making an urgent call to move any Covey any Covey this is dusty cyanide we are withdrawing off Charlie to NVA battalion in the open on the hilltop.

1825
02:47:11.14 --> 02:47:17.14
Request immediate diversion of a B 52 arc light strike to Charlie.

1826
02:47:17.14 --> 02:47:35.14
This is Covey 531 standby dusty only a few minutes later Covey transmitted dusty affirmative carbon outlaw diverted arc light for your target ETA 20 minutes you need to be 500 meters distance being deflate open your mouth and keep your heads down.

1827
02:47:35.14 --> 02:47:48.14
Duffy knew he was only a couple hundred yards off the hilltop but he needed his enemy bloodied so they couldn't regroup and pursue Roger Covey will we will be over 500 meters clear let the bombs fall.

1828
02:47:48.14 --> 02:47:55.14
They moved quickly soon rejoining their battalion high and doc Lou were shocked they were alive.

1829
02:47:55.14 --> 02:48:03.14
Tired exhausted and dragging their wounded the battalion gained little ground moving maybe another hundred yards before they heard the whistling bombs of death.

1830
02:48:03.14 --> 02:48:10.14
Hundreds of 500 and 750 pound bombs demolished the NVA forces on Charlie.

1831
02:48:10.14 --> 02:48:19.14
The paratroopers hugged the earth Duffy in May lay prone under a tree that shook like a wet dog showering them with leaves as the ground shuttered violently beneath them.

1832
02:48:19.14 --> 02:48:23.14
A dark cloud of smoke rose from the carnage of Charlie.

1833
02:48:23.14 --> 02:48:30.14
John lamented nothing could have survived two weeks of battle and an NVA funeral pyre.

1834
02:48:30.14 --> 02:48:39.14
Corpses corpses sit as the victors atop their prize.

1835
02:48:39.14 --> 02:48:43.14
I mean what do you think the battle damage assessment was of that.

1836
02:48:43.14 --> 02:48:52.14
Yeah well it was it inflicted tremendous damage on the enemy and I think I mentioned later the impact it had on the whole battle in the Central Highlands.

1837
02:48:52.14 --> 02:49:05.14
It thwarted their plans to quickly sweep down to take Contum city and then cut South Vietnam in half because of the damage that was done by all those strikes and what it cost them to take Charlie Hill.

1838
02:49:05.14 --> 02:49:19.14
That delayed their attack plans by a couple of weeks which gave the South Vietnamese an opportunity to get another division up there and to get all prepared to take on this attack against the city of Contum.

1839
02:49:19.14 --> 02:49:27.14
And in the end the South Vietnamese prevailed with a lot of American air support but they prevailed and the enemy did not take Contum city.

1840
02:49:27.14 --> 02:49:37.14
Their attack went no further than that and they ended up withdrawing to isolated positions really until the peace agreement was signed.

1841
02:49:37.14 --> 02:49:39.14
The line was held.

1842
02:49:39.14 --> 02:49:49.14
These guys aren't out of it yet though. April 15th 1972 in darkness the paratroopers followed Major Duffy down the mountainside.

1843
02:49:49.14 --> 02:49:54.14
They carried those who couldn't walk. They struggled through the tangled jungle. Exhaustion numbed their senses.

1844
02:49:54.14 --> 02:50:00.14
Even so they still felt the pain that racked their bodies. Infected wounds screamed with every step.

1845
02:50:00.14 --> 02:50:09.14
In spite of their misery hopes welled in their hearts as they had left the carnage of Charlie Hill even farther behind.

1846
02:50:09.14 --> 02:50:18.14
And then of course incoming there's a there's a friendly fire incident takes place which is awful.

1847
02:50:18.14 --> 02:50:25.14
Now they've got more dead. They've got more wounded to carry. They have to leave some dead.

1848
02:50:25.14 --> 02:50:35.14
High makes a radio call to his headquarters Red River this is 006 we are off the mountain in the northeast direction from our old home at the base of the ridge.

1849
02:50:35.14 --> 02:50:48.14
I have about 100 150 many wounded request helicopter extraction over 006 this is Red River negative there are no Helos available walk out over.

1850
02:50:48.14 --> 02:50:57.14
This is 006 Roger out. Duffy saw highs discuss what's up no helicopter we walk.

1851
02:50:57.14 --> 02:51:11.14
This is making me mad right now. And they're not they're not out of the yeah not figuratively literally they're not out of the woods yet.

1852
02:51:11.14 --> 02:51:20.14
Yeah. And then of course the enemy struck rat a tat crack crack boom boom ambush machine gun and rifle fire snapped around that mortars exploded everywhere enemy soldiers

1853
02:51:20.14 --> 02:51:29.14
attacked from the trees men drop wounded and dead many of the younger green paratroopers out of ammunition and at their wits and broken ran mowed down in their tracks.

1854
02:51:29.14 --> 02:51:40.14
The NBA 320th Division Commander positioned a fresh force east of Charlie to cut off any withdrawal. The second battalion from the 48th regiment was waiting in concealed positions.

1855
02:51:40.14 --> 02:51:48.14
They hit the paratroopers hard. John Duffy raised his weapon and shouted mail in. We need to break out of this gather all the men you can.

1856
02:51:48.14 --> 02:51:55.14
I'll lead you cover me and follow. OK Duffy we know surrender we fight to death.

1857
02:51:55.14 --> 02:52:06.14
John Cox is a R 15 and firing a few well placed rounds led a desperate counterattack amazingly they broke through the enemy and found a refuge a couple hundred yards north in the trees along the stream.

1858
02:52:06.14 --> 02:52:19.14
Duffy puffed we made it how many do we have may counted 36 plus you 37 total we have Captain High and Doc Lou and others.

1859
02:52:19.14 --> 02:52:28.14
May directed high set a perimeter redistribute redistribute ammunition to be sure every soldier has at least some this is where we'll make our stand.

1860
02:52:28.14 --> 02:52:34.14
Duffy's immediate thought was we need air we need it now. He grabbed his handset to make a call nothing shit.

1861
02:52:34.14 --> 02:52:40.14
May caught sight of his back Duffy you took a hit in the radio big hole it finished you OK.

1862
02:52:40.14 --> 02:52:46.14
Duffy several times wounded bloody filthy tired head throbbing body rife with pain answered yeah I'm fine.

1863
02:52:46.14 --> 02:53:00.14
He took the radio off his back and dropped it to the ground. He grabbed one of the two small aircrew survival radios he had clipped to his web gear turned it on and transmitted on the emergency frequency that all aircraft monitored any aircraft any aircraft.

1864
02:53:00.14 --> 02:53:18.14
This is Dusty cyanide tactical emergency US Air Force Captain Jim Higgins a forward air controller on his way back to play coup from supporting a special operation near the Cambodian border heard the call his few as low but he responded Dusty cyanide.

1865
02:53:18.14 --> 02:53:26.14
This is Covey five five five Covey Dusty cyanide we withdrew off Charlie last night on northeast of the hill in a small valley just ambush many killed.

1866
02:53:26.14 --> 02:53:35.14
We broke out need helicopter extraction I have thirty seven thirty seven packs several wounded need for Helos Roger Dusty standby.

1867
02:53:35.14 --> 02:53:40.14
I'll see what we can rustle up as you guys are out there on these operations like over.

1868
02:53:40.14 --> 02:53:53.14
Does everybody kind of know who Dusty cyanide is at this point is everybody tracking it by this time well we all did because the Panthers had been supporting him now the unit that's going to end up coming in to now save the day yet once again is three five

1869
02:53:53.14 --> 02:54:06.14
or three five they've not been involved in the operation up there at all to this point so I don't think that they knew Dusty cyanide at that point but they're soon going to find out who Dusty cyanide is.

1870
02:54:06.14 --> 02:54:18.14
And once we get into that part of the operation that goes to that audio recording that I had that was recorded by one of the air crews so the dialogue in there is word for word off that audio recording.

1871
02:54:18.14 --> 02:54:24.72
I mean, it's a technique that I use for a narrative nonfiction, but the dialogue obviously

1872
02:54:24.72 --> 02:54:26.32
is recreated.

1873
02:54:26.32 --> 02:54:32.04
Nobody remembers exactly what they said, but I took great care to talk to each of the participants,

1874
02:54:32.04 --> 02:54:38.16
and they saw all this dialogue as I developed it, and so they agree that this is very close

1875
02:54:38.16 --> 02:54:43.48
to the conversations that actually took place, so I use it to tell their story.

1876
02:54:43.48 --> 02:54:49.20
But as we get into the pickup here at the end, that's word for word off that audio tape

1877
02:54:49.20 --> 02:54:52.04
of what was being said in the aircraft.

1878
02:54:52.04 --> 02:54:54.56
Is Dusty Sinai an issued call sign?

1879
02:54:54.56 --> 02:54:57.24
Yeah, it was just randomly generated.

1880
02:54:57.24 --> 02:54:58.24
It was just randomly generated.

1881
02:54:58.24 --> 02:55:00.24
Issued, I remember I used to get those.

1882
02:55:00.24 --> 02:55:03.28
And for some reason we started just generating our own.

1883
02:55:03.28 --> 02:55:08.08
I don't know if that was legal or not, but that's what we did.

1884
02:55:08.08 --> 02:55:14.40
I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

1885
02:55:14.40 --> 02:55:21.40
This is really cool dialogue that you quote in here between Undertaker and EmBomber.

1886
02:55:21.40 --> 02:55:22.40
These are some good call signs.

1887
02:55:22.40 --> 02:55:23.40
That's their actual call signs.

1888
02:55:23.40 --> 02:55:25.80
It's good to go.

1889
02:55:25.80 --> 02:55:26.80
Undertaker 22.

1890
02:55:26.80 --> 02:55:28.76
Now, those aren't generated.

1891
02:55:28.76 --> 02:55:31.32
The air crew call signs, we had them for our whole tour.

1892
02:55:31.32 --> 02:55:32.32
Right, that's like Pink Panther.

1893
02:55:32.32 --> 02:55:37.92
We were the pick-and-thers, and their gladiator was the company's call sign.

1894
02:55:37.92 --> 02:55:41.08
For the unit that worked SOG with us.

1895
02:55:41.08 --> 02:55:49.88
These guys, the Cav, yeah, that EmBomber Undertaker was their guns, and Bomber was their lifships.

1896
02:55:49.88 --> 02:55:51.12
So these guys show up.

1897
02:55:51.12 --> 02:55:54.56
Duffy, Radio Cobra, Cobra, they're 25 meters away.

1898
02:55:54.56 --> 02:55:55.56
They're in that wood line.

1899
02:55:55.56 --> 02:55:56.56
Go get them.

1900
02:55:56.56 --> 02:55:57.56
Roger, Dusty, we're inbound.

1901
02:55:57.56 --> 02:55:58.56
Keep your heads down.

1902
02:55:58.56 --> 02:55:59.56
The Cobra's laid waste.

1903
02:55:59.56 --> 02:56:01.16
EmBomber 6 called short final.

1904
02:56:01.16 --> 02:56:03.68
The enemy opened up with small arms and machine gun fire.

1905
02:56:03.68 --> 02:56:06.60
A B-40 rocket streaked past.

1906
02:56:06.60 --> 02:56:09.32
The Huey pulled up and turned sharply to the left, climbing.

1907
02:56:09.32 --> 02:56:12.04
The right door gunner reported a jam in his machine gun.

1908
02:56:12.04 --> 02:56:13.36
He was out of action.

1909
02:56:13.36 --> 02:56:15.44
No more protective fire on the right side.

1910
02:56:15.44 --> 02:56:17.60
More enemy pressed in on Duffy and May.

1911
02:56:17.60 --> 02:56:20.76
They moved their group as fast as they could go.

1912
02:56:20.76 --> 02:56:22.52
Undertaker 22 kept track of them.

1913
02:56:22.52 --> 02:56:25.08
Dusty, you still on the LZ or moving away from it?

1914
02:56:25.08 --> 02:56:26.44
We're moving to the November.

1915
02:56:26.44 --> 02:56:29.84
Roger, I'll be in there with 20 millimeter.

1916
02:56:29.84 --> 02:56:31.08
Still got small arms.

1917
02:56:31.08 --> 02:56:34.12
We moved another 100 meters.

1918
02:56:34.12 --> 02:56:35.52
We're going to stop here.

1919
02:56:35.52 --> 02:56:36.60
We got five people left.

1920
02:56:36.60 --> 02:56:41.92
So over this period, which I skipped, they're picking up as many guys as they can.

1921
02:56:41.92 --> 02:56:45.28
And then they'd get shot out of an LZ and then they'd keep moving.

1922
02:56:45.28 --> 02:56:46.84
So they're down to five guys left.

1923
02:56:46.84 --> 02:56:48.24
Right, this is the last lift.

1924
02:56:48.24 --> 02:56:49.24
The last crew.

1925
02:56:49.24 --> 02:56:50.24
The fourth lift.

1926
02:56:50.24 --> 02:56:52.20
And Bomber 6 began another approach.

1927
02:56:52.20 --> 02:56:55.08
Duffy popped his last smoke.

1928
02:56:55.08 --> 02:56:56.08
Gibbs transmitted.

1929
02:56:56.08 --> 02:56:57.08
I got yellow smoke.

1930
02:56:57.08 --> 02:56:58.08
Duffy warned.

1931
02:56:58.08 --> 02:56:59.76
Still got small arms fire.

1932
02:56:59.76 --> 02:57:01.40
Still got small arms fire.

1933
02:57:01.40 --> 02:57:02.40
Automatic rifles.

1934
02:57:02.40 --> 02:57:03.40
Undertaker added.

1935
02:57:03.40 --> 02:57:07.76
Still drawing small arms fire from the tree line down there across the trees at year 12

1936
02:57:07.76 --> 02:57:10.08
where the friendlies and the bad guys are in the trees.

1937
02:57:10.08 --> 02:57:12.68
And Bomber 6 continued his approach.

1938
02:57:12.68 --> 02:57:14.56
Duffy guided him down to the ground.

1939
02:57:14.56 --> 02:57:17.96
The last five members of the 11th Airborne Battalion scrambled aboard.

1940
02:57:17.96 --> 02:57:20.28
Go, go Duffy shouted.

1941
02:57:20.28 --> 02:57:25.48
He stood on the landing strut, his firing his car 15 and helping the others in.

1942
02:57:25.48 --> 02:57:27.80
An NBA soldier ran toward the helicopter.

1943
02:57:27.80 --> 02:57:30.36
His arm cocked, ready to throw a grenade.

1944
02:57:30.36 --> 02:57:32.40
Duffy cut him down.

1945
02:57:32.40 --> 02:57:40.12
Long client climbed in followed by Corporal Long, Captain High and Major May crack around

1946
02:57:40.12 --> 02:57:45.40
blasted through the cockpit crack another past just behind Dennis Watson's head.

1947
02:57:45.40 --> 02:57:46.40
It hit Dallas Nicen.

1948
02:57:46.40 --> 02:57:48.40
I say that name right.

1949
02:57:48.40 --> 02:57:53.80
Nathan, Nathan, Nathan, Nathan, it hit Dallas, Nathan in the back as he fired his door gun

1950
02:57:53.80 --> 02:57:55.24
protecting the crew.

1951
02:57:55.24 --> 02:57:57.80
He pushed his his intercom button.

1952
02:57:57.80 --> 02:57:59.96
Hey, hit.

1953
02:57:59.96 --> 02:58:01.16
Watson looked back.

1954
02:58:01.16 --> 02:58:04.20
Your eyes held for a moment then Nicen's closed.

1955
02:58:04.20 --> 02:58:08.28
With everyone on board, Duffy gave the other door gunner a thumbs up and the young man

1956
02:58:08.28 --> 02:58:09.52
hollered on the intercom.

1957
02:58:09.52 --> 02:58:13.48
Go, go, go, go, get out of here.

1958
02:58:13.48 --> 02:58:17.92
Bullets riddled the chopper as it lifted at 100 feet once smashed into High's right

1959
02:58:17.92 --> 02:58:18.92
foot.

1960
02:58:18.92 --> 02:58:21.000
He fell backward out of the helicopter.

1961
02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:25.52
John Duffy still standing on the landing skid grabbed hold of his webgear just as he slid

1962
02:58:25.52 --> 02:58:29.20
by stopping his fall and certain death.

1963
02:58:29.20 --> 02:58:33.56
With help from May, he pulled high back in May rendered aid.

1964
02:58:33.56 --> 02:58:37.88
Duffy looked across the helicopter and saw Dallas Nicen hanging out the other side held

1965
02:58:37.88 --> 02:58:40.28
by his safety tether.

1966
02:58:40.28 --> 02:58:43.56
John climbed in and moved over to Dallas pulling him back inside.

1967
02:58:43.56 --> 02:58:47.16
He patched the wounded Nicen's back with a plastic sealer and a bandage.

1968
02:58:47.16 --> 02:58:49.20
He turned him over.

1969
02:58:49.20 --> 02:58:52.68
Dallas had a much larger hole where the bullet exited his chest.

1970
02:58:52.68 --> 02:58:54.12
It was bad.

1971
02:58:54.12 --> 02:58:55.52
The wound bubbled.

1972
02:58:55.52 --> 02:58:57.48
The bullet at his lung.

1973
02:58:57.48 --> 02:59:01.44
It started patching and sealing the hole when the bubbles quit.

1974
02:59:01.44 --> 02:59:03.28
Dallas stopped breathing.

1975
02:59:03.28 --> 02:59:05.12
John tried mouth to mouth.

1976
02:59:05.12 --> 02:59:06.12
Nothing.

1977
02:59:06.12 --> 02:59:10.80
Dallas Nicen died in John Duffy's arms.

1978
02:59:10.80 --> 02:59:19.04
It had been five days since the enemy began their final all out assault against Charlie.

1979
02:59:19.04 --> 02:59:23.12
Five days of some of the most intense combat ever fought.

1980
02:59:23.12 --> 02:59:29.12
Five days in hell consigned to death but committed to fighting with valor to the end.

1981
02:59:29.12 --> 02:59:34.88
Indeed, it had been less than two weeks since the 11th Battalion fresh from its duty in

1982
02:59:34.88 --> 02:59:40.40
Saigon had occupied fire base Charlie on Easter Sunday.

1983
02:59:40.40 --> 02:59:42.36
But that was a lifetime ago.

1984
02:59:42.36 --> 02:59:44.60
Their world had changed.

1985
02:59:44.60 --> 02:59:50.80
It was different from how it had been and it would never be the same for any of them

1986
02:59:50.80 --> 03:00:00.44
ever again.

1987
03:00:00.44 --> 03:00:04.52
And thus ends the battle for fire base Charlie.

1988
03:00:04.52 --> 03:00:13.24
Yeah, and as you mentioned, 37 out of 471 paratroopers made it out and you did also mention that

1989
03:00:13.24 --> 03:00:14.88
there were some stragglers that came in.

1990
03:00:14.88 --> 03:00:15.88
Right.

1991
03:00:15.88 --> 03:00:22.000
There was another group of about, I think, 20 that the artillery FO Lieutenant Lap rallies.

1992
03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:26.80
It took them several days though to get back to friendly lines and recovered.

1993
03:00:26.80 --> 03:00:27.80
And that's pretty well out.

1994
03:00:27.80 --> 03:00:35.16
A few other stragglers but out of that 471 man battalion most killed or captured or missing

1995
03:00:35.16 --> 03:00:41.84
and never knew their status.

1996
03:00:41.84 --> 03:00:45.20
John Duffy wrote a poem.

1997
03:00:45.20 --> 03:00:53.68
He ended up at the funeral of of Colonel bow posthumously promoted Colonel bow and

1998
03:00:53.68 --> 03:00:57.56
he wrote a poem about that funeral.

1999
03:00:57.56 --> 03:01:02.48
And again, this is from his book, which is called the battle for Charlie.

2000
03:01:02.48 --> 03:01:06.42
It's called the commander's family.

2001
03:01:06.42 --> 03:01:13.60
Can you picture the scene in sense burning banners hung casket draped.

2002
03:01:13.60 --> 03:01:17.04
The moans and the weeping blend.

2003
03:01:17.04 --> 03:01:20.88
Sorrow hangs in the atmosphere.

2004
03:01:20.88 --> 03:01:26.88
The commander's comrades gathered to offer their last salute.

2005
03:01:26.88 --> 03:01:31.04
The young widow strong at first.

2006
03:01:31.04 --> 03:01:36.60
But soon sorrow overcomes her.

2007
03:01:36.60 --> 03:01:45.20
It's not the smoke which tears my eyes, although I have lit seven Joss sticks.

2008
03:01:45.20 --> 03:01:49.08
The words are spoken for all to hear.

2009
03:01:49.08 --> 03:01:53.88
Now it is I who must say the last.

2010
03:01:53.88 --> 03:01:56.50
I will say the truth.

2011
03:01:56.50 --> 03:01:59.72
And how he died.

2012
03:01:59.72 --> 03:02:04.44
He died leading the paratroopers he loved.

2013
03:02:04.44 --> 03:02:09.28
He died fighting for the freedom he cherished.

2014
03:02:09.28 --> 03:02:19.92
He died a hero of his country.

2015
03:02:19.92 --> 03:02:24.88
And that is certainly the truth.

2016
03:02:24.88 --> 03:02:33.20
And I am certainly glad that you, sir, have captured these heroics for for all of us to

2017
03:02:33.20 --> 03:02:36.76
hear and understand.

2018
03:02:36.76 --> 03:02:41.44
And you mentioned this earlier.

2019
03:02:41.44 --> 03:02:48.36
We can be proud to report that Major John Duffy has been properly recognized for his

2020
03:02:48.36 --> 03:02:50.12
heroics.

2021
03:02:50.12 --> 03:02:57.40
He was awarded the Medal of Honor on July 5th, 2022.

2022
03:02:57.40 --> 03:03:01.68
So just a few weeks ago, few days ago, few days ago, really.

2023
03:03:01.68 --> 03:03:03.32
So you went out there for that ceremony?

2024
03:03:03.32 --> 03:03:04.32
I did.

2025
03:03:04.32 --> 03:03:09.64
I was there in the White House with him, with my wife and daughter, the daughter who he

2026
03:03:09.64 --> 03:03:14.36
danced with on the deck of the Midway to be present.

2027
03:03:14.36 --> 03:03:18.16
And it was it was quite a ceremony, long, long time coming.

2028
03:03:18.16 --> 03:03:22.20
I think I'd mentioned he was put in for the Medal of Honor at the time Peter Kama submitted

2029
03:03:22.20 --> 03:03:23.20
him.

2030
03:03:23.20 --> 03:03:27.08
It was downgraded to a distinguished service cross.

2031
03:03:27.08 --> 03:03:31.24
Largely John feels because all the eyewitness statements that he had at the time when Kama

2032
03:03:31.24 --> 03:03:35.28
submitted it were Vietnamese statements.

2033
03:03:35.28 --> 03:03:37.92
And so it was not supported.

2034
03:03:37.92 --> 03:03:42.64
Years later, Peter Kama resubmitted with the additional information, had the audio recording

2035
03:03:42.64 --> 03:03:47.80
now, had some eyewitness statements by others, some of the air crews.

2036
03:03:47.80 --> 03:03:56.88
But it took forever to wind its way through the bureaucracy and finally got approval and

2037
03:03:56.88 --> 03:04:02.72
was presented on July 5th last week to him.

2038
03:04:02.72 --> 03:04:05.08
Quite an emotional event to be at.

2039
03:04:05.08 --> 03:04:08.28
Le Van May was there as well.

2040
03:04:08.28 --> 03:04:12.36
There are some, you can find it if you just do a Google search for John Duffy Medal of

2041
03:04:12.36 --> 03:04:13.36
Honor.

2042
03:04:13.36 --> 03:04:16.36
They've got some video from the White House ceremony.

2043
03:04:16.36 --> 03:04:22.72
And as the President was making remarks just before hanging the Medal of Honor on John,

2044
03:04:22.72 --> 03:04:28.68
he said then we're honored to have also here his Vietnamese counterpart, Le Van May, Colonel

2045
03:04:28.68 --> 03:04:30.16
Le Van May.

2046
03:04:30.16 --> 03:04:31.16
And May stood up.

2047
03:04:31.16 --> 03:04:37.60
I had a suit on, but his red Vietnamese paratrooper, Berre, saluted the President.

2048
03:04:37.60 --> 03:04:43.04
It was quite a moving experience.

2049
03:04:43.04 --> 03:04:45.24
Yeah.

2050
03:04:45.24 --> 03:04:56.16
Well, that's just amazing that they did get it done and that he was awarded properly.

2051
03:04:56.16 --> 03:04:57.16
So deserved.

2052
03:04:57.16 --> 03:05:01.28
I mean, you've read Medal of Honor citations before and this is so deserving of the Medal

2053
03:05:01.28 --> 03:05:02.28
of Honor.

2054
03:05:02.28 --> 03:05:07.04
Yeah, I can't imagine the person that downgraded this thing.

2055
03:05:07.04 --> 03:05:12.56
I get frustrated sometimes when I think about the people that sit around and downgrade awards.

2056
03:05:12.56 --> 03:05:20.36
It tells me they probably shouldn't be in the positions where they're doing that.

2057
03:05:20.36 --> 03:05:30.08
Another unbelievable part of this book that I found to be fascinating and inspiring was

2058
03:05:30.08 --> 03:05:32.96
going into the aftermath and what happened everybody after the war.

2059
03:05:32.96 --> 03:05:41.56
And really for me, especially the Vietnamese soldiers that, I mean, what, 19 wasn't very

2060
03:05:41.56 --> 03:05:45.80
much after this that South Vietnam fell.

2061
03:05:45.80 --> 03:05:47.56
Yeah, 1975.

2062
03:05:47.56 --> 03:05:53.88
And so these individuals that had fought so heroically, they all had to either get out

2063
03:05:53.88 --> 03:05:58.16
of there or try and get out of there.

2064
03:05:58.16 --> 03:06:06.84
Some of them served in prison camps and they all had the goal of making it to America.

2065
03:06:06.84 --> 03:06:10.80
And it's also incredible what they all did when they got here.

2066
03:06:10.80 --> 03:06:12.80
I think it was May.

2067
03:06:12.80 --> 03:06:15.16
Is it May that ends up he's working as a janitor somewhere?

2068
03:06:15.16 --> 03:06:16.16
Was that May?

2069
03:06:16.16 --> 03:06:22.28
He was, yeah, for a while and we're already end up he was in Missouri for a time.

2070
03:06:22.28 --> 03:06:23.68
Yeah, I think that was it.

2071
03:06:23.68 --> 03:06:25.16
And again, get the book.

2072
03:06:25.16 --> 03:06:26.16
And going to school.

2073
03:06:26.16 --> 03:06:29.96
He was working, yeah, doing janitorial work, going to school to get, increase his education.

2074
03:06:29.96 --> 03:06:34.08
He ends up a highly successful guy out here in Silicon Valley by the time it's all over

2075
03:06:34.08 --> 03:06:35.08
and done.

2076
03:06:35.08 --> 03:06:39.16
Yeah, but it kicks off with him being a, I mean, highly decorated, highly experienced

2077
03:06:39.16 --> 03:06:43.80
to say the least, war hero.

2078
03:06:43.80 --> 03:06:45.000
And he shows up here.

2079
03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:48.84
Hey, well, you can, you can, you know, sweep up and work as a janitor.

2080
03:06:48.84 --> 03:06:50.48
Okay, that's what I'm doing then.

2081
03:06:50.48 --> 03:06:55.60
And then talks about that and how he made it through that and how all of their, you know,

2082
03:06:55.60 --> 03:06:57.80
all the Vietnamese came in, all their kids do wonderful.

2083
03:06:57.80 --> 03:07:00.12
Huge, all hugely successful.

2084
03:07:00.12 --> 03:07:06.68
It's amazing to hear that part of the story of how it all turns out for these, for these

2085
03:07:06.68 --> 03:07:11.12
folks and of course, never forgetting the incredible sacrifices of, of the ones that

2086
03:07:11.12 --> 03:07:12.36
didn't make it, right?

2087
03:07:12.36 --> 03:07:17.72
The ones that didn't survive or the ones that didn't make it out of, out of Vietnam.

2088
03:07:17.72 --> 03:07:22.40
And what a horror, what a horror that is.

2089
03:07:22.40 --> 03:07:25.80
But man, the book is amazing.

2090
03:07:25.80 --> 03:07:30.92
Like I said, I read a small portion of it today, less than 10% of the book today.

2091
03:07:30.92 --> 03:07:38.12
Get the book so you can learn about it and get the full story.

2092
03:07:38.12 --> 03:07:44.72
And by the way, if you haven't gotten through the Valley, that was kind of a, for this podcast,

2093
03:07:44.72 --> 03:07:51.92
that was sort of like a turning point in my mind and the podcast is how powerful it was

2094
03:07:51.92 --> 03:07:56.68
for me to be able to sit here and talk with you and the feedback that I got about that

2095
03:07:56.68 --> 03:08:07.28
podcast because it's hard for a normal person to comprehend the level of suffering that

2096
03:08:07.28 --> 03:08:17.28
a person can go through and a survive, but then go on and thrive and carry on with life

2097
03:08:17.28 --> 03:08:22.60
and, and, and, and have an amazing attitude.

2098
03:08:22.60 --> 03:08:27.16
You know, I mean, we were talking a little bit when we weren't recording and you know,

2099
03:08:27.16 --> 03:08:32.84
you were, you know, your back's a little bit sore or your knees a little bit sore.

2100
03:08:32.84 --> 03:08:37.44
And you're very thankful to have a sore back and very thankful to have a sore knee.

2101
03:08:37.44 --> 03:08:41.80
Because if it wasn't for a sore back and a sore knee, the only way for you to not have

2102
03:08:41.80 --> 03:08:44.92
a sore back and a sore knee would be you wouldn't be here right now.

2103
03:08:44.92 --> 03:08:45.92
That's right.

2104
03:08:45.92 --> 03:08:49.88
I'd be laying dead in a cobra wreck, wreckage in the jungles of Vietnam.

2105
03:08:49.88 --> 03:08:53.80
I'm very grateful for every day that I've had since that.

2106
03:08:53.80 --> 03:08:58.000
I guess when you go through something like that, I know I've talked to John Duffy and

2107
03:08:58.000 --> 03:08:59.000
Le Van May.

2108
03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:03.44
They, they just have pure joy for every day that they've had since then.

2109
03:09:03.44 --> 03:09:07.80
Every day since Charlie is a gift to each one of them.

2110
03:09:07.80 --> 03:09:12.76
Well, probably a good place to stop for now.

2111
03:09:12.76 --> 03:09:15.48
Echo Charles, do you have any questions?

2112
03:09:15.48 --> 03:09:17.000
No questions today.

2113
03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:20.12
It's hard to have any questions after this.

2114
03:09:20.12 --> 03:09:22.88
Sir, any, any closing thoughts?

2115
03:09:22.88 --> 03:09:26.04
No, it's just, you know, this is an important story.

2116
03:09:26.04 --> 03:09:28.56
So I'm glad that we had a chance to discuss it at the podcast.

2117
03:09:28.56 --> 03:09:34.84
I hope the story gets read far and wide for, for John Duffy, for Le Van May, for Hyde Dwan,

2118
03:09:34.84 --> 03:09:38.16
those three central figures of the, of the book.

2119
03:09:38.16 --> 03:09:44.56
And just for the Vietnamese paratroopers, because they did exhibit extraordinary valor

2120
03:09:44.56 --> 03:09:48.80
really throughout the, throughout the war, and they need to be put in a category separate

2121
03:09:48.80 --> 03:09:53.88
from the arvin that are dismissed as, as not being heroic soldiers on the battlefield.

2122
03:09:53.88 --> 03:09:56.72
These guys certainly, certainly were.

2123
03:09:56.72 --> 03:10:02.84
Well, you've, you've certainly brought that to light and everyone that hears this and

2124
03:10:02.84 --> 03:10:08.72
read your book will no doubt understand the, the bravery that they had.

2125
03:10:08.72 --> 03:10:15.72
And thank you once again for, for coming, thanks for your service and sacrifice.

2126
03:10:15.72 --> 03:10:20.40
Thanks for your support to the troops on the ground now that I have a bunch of friends

2127
03:10:20.40 --> 03:10:23.000
that were SOG.

2128
03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:26.72
They love you guys so much for what you did for them.

2129
03:10:26.72 --> 03:10:34.16
So thank you for, for supporting those troops on the ground and, and thank you for your,

2130
03:10:34.16 --> 03:10:39.76
for your sacrifice as a, as a prisoner of war and the rest of your service in the army.

2131
03:10:39.76 --> 03:10:42.24
I know that, that wasn't even the end of your career.

2132
03:10:42.24 --> 03:10:45.000
You know, you went on for how many years did you end up serving?

2133
03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:46.000
Thirty.

2134
03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:47.000
Thirty years.

2135
03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.44
So that was just the beginning.

2136
03:10:49.44 --> 03:10:54.000
So thank you for all your service and thank you for taking the time and making the effort

2137
03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:59.44
to share these incredible stories with us, both the, your own personal experiences and

2138
03:10:59.44 --> 03:11:05.76
the experiences of these other heroes so that we all can learn and we can all be inspired

2139
03:11:05.76 --> 03:11:16.32
by you and by your comrades and we can all live better lives knowing and understanding

2140
03:11:16.32 --> 03:11:19.24
that true heroes exist.

2141
03:11:19.24 --> 03:11:20.32
Thank you, sir.

2142
03:11:20.32 --> 03:11:23.32
Thank you, Jocco.

2143
03:11:23.32 --> 03:11:30.16
And with that, Colonel Reader has left the building so awesome to be able to speak with

2144
03:11:30.16 --> 03:11:31.16
him again.

2145
03:11:31.16 --> 03:11:38.52
And man, those stories are crazy.

2146
03:11:38.52 --> 03:11:47.72
When you start talking about having 70 130 millimeter artillery rounds land on your position

2147
03:11:47.72 --> 03:11:56.48
on a little no on a hilltop or you start talking about having 10 51 caliber machine guns shooting

2148
03:11:56.48 --> 03:11:59.76
at you when you're flying in a helicopter.

2149
03:11:59.76 --> 03:12:06.28
Those are those are those are not possible to explain to a human.

2150
03:12:06.28 --> 03:12:08.12
I don't think you can do it.

2151
03:12:08.12 --> 03:12:11.40
I don't think there's words to explain yet.

2152
03:12:11.40 --> 03:12:17.08
Doesn't seem and this is me coming from a perspective of not very much understanding

2153
03:12:17.08 --> 03:12:23.52
and knowing the magnitude of these things, especially, you know, I know what I know what

2154
03:12:23.52 --> 03:12:29.44
a 50 caliber handgun sounds like.

2155
03:12:29.44 --> 03:12:33.08
Feels like 51 times 10.

2156
03:12:33.08 --> 03:12:34.72
Yeah, shot at you.

2157
03:12:34.72 --> 03:12:39.52
Those are way bigger than obviously.

2158
03:12:39.52 --> 03:12:43.76
And then okay, actually, this is a question I did have while I'm listening to the stuff.

2159
03:12:43.76 --> 03:12:47.28
I just dismissed it as something I'll never understand.

2160
03:12:47.28 --> 03:12:48.76
I won't comprehend it.

2161
03:12:48.76 --> 03:12:49.92
I don't know the feeling.

2162
03:12:49.92 --> 03:12:53.12
I can imagine it or I can try to imagine it.

2163
03:12:53.12 --> 03:12:54.12
That's it.

2164
03:12:54.12 --> 03:12:56.12
I'm not going to imagine it.

2165
03:12:56.12 --> 03:12:57.12
Understand that.

2166
03:12:57.12 --> 03:13:03.48
But these terms artillery, what is that?

2167
03:13:03.48 --> 03:13:04.48
Artillery.

2168
03:13:04.48 --> 03:13:05.48
Yep.

2169
03:13:05.48 --> 03:13:10.12
Artillery is a form of what's called indirect fire and what indirect fire is.

2170
03:13:10.12 --> 03:13:12.28
So direct fires, I aim a gun at you.

2171
03:13:12.28 --> 03:13:14.36
I can see you and I shoot at you.

2172
03:13:14.36 --> 03:13:16.28
That's direct fire.

2173
03:13:16.28 --> 03:13:20.24
Indirect fires, I don't have to be able to see you because it's going to launch at a

2174
03:13:20.24 --> 03:13:24.84
high angle up and it's going to rain down from the sky.

2175
03:13:24.84 --> 03:13:26.48
And that's what this is.

2176
03:13:26.48 --> 03:13:32.24
These 130 millimeter cannons are, you know, a kilometer or two kilometers away.

2177
03:13:32.24 --> 03:13:33.40
They can be really far away.

2178
03:13:33.40 --> 03:13:35.28
You can't even see them.

2179
03:13:35.28 --> 03:13:41.48
And they're just dropping big, giant bombs on you from the sky.

2180
03:13:41.48 --> 03:13:42.48
That's artillery.

2181
03:13:42.48 --> 03:13:46.20
And it's really horrifying because you don't know where it's coming from.

2182
03:13:46.20 --> 03:13:49.40
And there's nothing you can do to stop it.

2183
03:13:49.40 --> 03:13:52.56
The round got fired, you know, a few seconds ago.

2184
03:13:52.56 --> 03:13:55.72
Maybe like even multiple, like 10 seconds ago.

2185
03:13:55.72 --> 03:13:57.84
Like that's how long their flight can be.

2186
03:13:57.84 --> 03:14:00.12
Their flight can be a really long time.

2187
03:14:00.12 --> 03:14:02.92
So it's just coming and there's nothing you can do about it.

2188
03:14:02.92 --> 03:14:05.80
Now if you're in an urban environment, you can get overhead cover.

2189
03:14:05.80 --> 03:14:06.80
That's cool.

2190
03:14:06.80 --> 03:14:08.56
You can survive if you have overhead cover.

2191
03:14:08.56 --> 03:14:09.56
That's great.

2192
03:14:09.56 --> 03:14:12.44
But it's just a matter of luck.

2193
03:14:12.44 --> 03:14:13.44
Yeah.

2194
03:14:13.44 --> 03:14:17.04
And because it kind of seems like in that way where it's like a matter of luck even

2195
03:14:17.04 --> 03:14:19.04
for the guy shooting it, right?

2196
03:14:19.04 --> 03:14:24.80
Some level of luck for the guy shooting it as well, except for the fact that when I want

2197
03:14:24.80 --> 03:14:27.84
to hit you, I'm not going to fire one.

2198
03:14:27.84 --> 03:14:29.56
I'm going to fire 70.

2199
03:14:29.56 --> 03:14:31.000
And then my chances, right?

2200
03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:32.16
Because that's exactly what they were doing.

2201
03:14:32.16 --> 03:14:33.16
Yeah.

2202
03:14:33.16 --> 03:14:34.16
Like, hey, we're going to hit this whole hilltop.

2203
03:14:34.16 --> 03:14:35.16
Yeah.

2204
03:14:35.16 --> 03:14:37.60
And you know how like, oh, you talk about mortars and stuff where it's like.

2205
03:14:37.60 --> 03:14:40.16
And mortars are also usually in direct fire.

2206
03:14:40.16 --> 03:14:41.16
Yeah.

2207
03:14:41.16 --> 03:14:42.76
So it's kind of like it's bad.

2208
03:14:42.76 --> 03:14:43.76
Okay.

2209
03:14:43.76 --> 03:14:44.76
So direct fire, right?

2210
03:14:44.76 --> 03:14:46.92
Let's say I don't know someone's shooting and they're getting closer or something like

2211
03:14:46.92 --> 03:14:47.92
that.

2212
03:14:47.92 --> 03:14:51.56
Or let's say you see, oh, I see a guy pointing a gun at me or whatever.

2213
03:14:51.56 --> 03:14:53.28
I'm going to shoot back.

2214
03:14:53.28 --> 03:14:54.72
I can move.

2215
03:14:54.72 --> 03:14:56.92
I can take cover kind of a thing.

2216
03:14:56.92 --> 03:14:57.92
We can relocate.

2217
03:14:57.92 --> 03:15:00.60
Let's just go over there out of the way.

2218
03:15:00.60 --> 03:15:01.60
Kind of a thing.

2219
03:15:01.60 --> 03:15:04.44
This is my tactical genius coming out right now.

2220
03:15:04.44 --> 03:15:05.44
Tactical echo.

2221
03:15:05.44 --> 03:15:06.44
Yeah.

2222
03:15:06.44 --> 03:15:07.44
Hell yeah.

2223
03:15:07.44 --> 03:15:08.44
And then you know what?

2224
03:15:08.44 --> 03:15:10.88
Artillery is kind of like, boom, you know, you hear a mortar or whatever.

2225
03:15:10.88 --> 03:15:12.04
Where are you going to go?

2226
03:15:12.04 --> 03:15:15.48
You could go into the, to the, in the line of fire or whatever.

2227
03:15:15.48 --> 03:15:18.04
It's like just how you could like avoid it.

2228
03:15:18.04 --> 03:15:19.04
Oh yeah.

2229
03:15:19.04 --> 03:15:20.04
You could go right into it as well.

2230
03:15:20.04 --> 03:15:21.04
It's like you don't even know.

2231
03:15:21.04 --> 03:15:22.04
Yeah.

2232
03:15:22.04 --> 03:15:23.36
It's just a horrible, horrible.

2233
03:15:23.36 --> 03:15:27.36
This is what, you know, World War I when they would just receive these barrages.

2234
03:15:27.36 --> 03:15:30.24
That's why they got crazy shell shock.

2235
03:15:30.24 --> 03:15:34.60
That's why you see those guys that are absolutely horrified because they just got used to this

2236
03:15:34.60 --> 03:15:40.68
extreme level of horror and this level of, it's like, you might think, oh, well it's

2237
03:15:40.68 --> 03:15:41.68
just random.

2238
03:15:41.68 --> 03:15:45.36
There's nothing you can do about it, but it's not even when you, when you're receiving 70

2239
03:15:45.36 --> 03:15:48.32
rounds, it starts to not be so random anymore.

2240
03:15:48.32 --> 03:15:50.60
They're eventually the odds are they're going to get me.

2241
03:15:50.60 --> 03:15:53.08
That's what's going to happen.

2242
03:15:53.08 --> 03:15:55.68
So then what is ordinance then?

2243
03:15:55.68 --> 03:16:00.60
Cause I, you know, you hear like artillery year old heavy artillery or the just ordinance

2244
03:16:00.60 --> 03:16:01.60
is just the rounds.

2245
03:16:01.60 --> 03:16:02.60
Anything.

2246
03:16:02.60 --> 03:16:03.60
Yeah.

2247
03:16:03.60 --> 03:16:04.60
Like a general turn.

2248
03:16:04.60 --> 03:16:05.60
Yeah.

2249
03:16:05.60 --> 03:16:06.60
So, yeah.

2250
03:16:06.60 --> 03:16:12.44
I mean, even a bullet for a, for a handgun could be considered ordinance, but so could

2251
03:16:12.44 --> 03:16:17.24
the round from a tank or from howitzer can also be considered or ordinance dropped from

2252
03:16:17.24 --> 03:16:18.24
an aircraft.

2253
03:16:18.24 --> 03:16:19.24
Yeah.

2254
03:16:19.24 --> 03:16:20.92
Is a tank round?

2255
03:16:20.92 --> 03:16:21.92
That's like what?

2256
03:16:21.92 --> 03:16:22.92
120.

2257
03:16:22.92 --> 03:16:23.92
120.

2258
03:16:23.92 --> 03:16:24.92
120.

2259
03:16:24.92 --> 03:16:25.92
Is that artillery?

2260
03:16:25.92 --> 03:16:26.92
No.

2261
03:16:26.92 --> 03:16:30.52
I mean, no, it's not technically it's a tank round and a lot of times that'll be direct

2262
03:16:30.52 --> 03:16:31.52
fire.

2263
03:16:31.52 --> 03:16:32.52
Yeah.

2264
03:16:32.52 --> 03:16:33.52
There you go.

2265
03:16:33.52 --> 03:16:34.52
Yeah.

2266
03:16:34.52 --> 03:16:35.52
That's crazy, man.

2267
03:16:35.52 --> 03:16:42.12
I, a lot of times, even when you talk about it, you know, when you hear anytime I think

2268
03:16:42.12 --> 03:16:48.68
of grenades or artillery in this case or whatever, like, you know, you imagine like the concussion,

2269
03:16:48.68 --> 03:16:49.68
right?

2270
03:16:49.68 --> 03:16:52.40
Cause even shooting a gun is more of a concussion than maybe the average person might think if

2271
03:16:52.40 --> 03:16:53.40
they haven't been around.

2272
03:16:53.40 --> 03:16:56.40
What's the most scared you've ever been in your whole life?

2273
03:16:56.40 --> 03:16:58.40
I don't know.

2274
03:16:58.40 --> 03:17:02.92
I mean, I'm sure as a kid I've been scared, but scared, scared.

2275
03:17:02.92 --> 03:17:05.44
Did you ever think you were going to die?

2276
03:17:05.44 --> 03:17:06.44
Yeah.

2277
03:17:06.44 --> 03:17:13.12
Like in the water, I was at Waimea one time, like North Shore on Oahu and it was big.

2278
03:17:13.12 --> 03:17:17.04
This was in the height of my cockiness in the water.

2279
03:17:17.04 --> 03:17:22.36
And I went out on a day they, there was actually the surf contest wasn't going on in Waimea,

2280
03:17:22.36 --> 03:17:24.64
but it was going on at some type of land, I think.

2281
03:17:24.64 --> 03:17:25.64
Pipeline.

2282
03:17:25.64 --> 03:17:26.64
Yeah.

2283
03:17:26.64 --> 03:17:28.68
So, but the waves are huge.

2284
03:17:28.68 --> 03:17:31.76
It was the kind of when the waves hit, like it vibrated the whole beach and I was like,

2285
03:17:31.76 --> 03:17:33.08
oh yeah, I'll go out there.

2286
03:17:33.08 --> 03:17:37.28
Lifeguards all just, lifeguards just around Robin just saving guys.

2287
03:17:37.28 --> 03:17:38.28
Yeah.

2288
03:17:38.28 --> 03:17:39.28
Were you on a boogie board?

2289
03:17:39.28 --> 03:17:40.28
No.

2290
03:17:40.28 --> 03:17:41.28
Body surfing.

2291
03:17:41.28 --> 03:17:42.28
Body surfing.

2292
03:17:42.28 --> 03:17:47.76
So I went out and it got ahead of me like for like second set of time.

2293
03:17:47.76 --> 03:17:50.72
I didn't have to get saved, but I was pretty.

2294
03:17:50.72 --> 03:17:53.68
How long did you stay out for?

2295
03:17:53.68 --> 03:17:55.40
Like 10 minutes, I would say.

2296
03:17:55.40 --> 03:17:56.40
Yeah.

2297
03:17:56.40 --> 03:17:57.40
Imagine this.

2298
03:17:57.40 --> 03:17:58.56
Imagine all that 10 minutes.

2299
03:17:58.56 --> 03:18:01.32
How long were you really scared for in that 10 minutes?

2300
03:18:01.32 --> 03:18:02.32
Like two minutes.

2301
03:18:02.32 --> 03:18:03.32
Two minutes.

2302
03:18:03.32 --> 03:18:04.32
Okay.

2303
03:18:04.32 --> 03:18:09.36
Now picture that two minutes compressed into five seconds and then multiply it times seven

2304
03:18:09.36 --> 03:18:10.36
hours.

2305
03:18:10.36 --> 03:18:12.80
Like it's horror, bro.

2306
03:18:12.80 --> 03:18:13.80
Oh yeah.

2307
03:18:13.80 --> 03:18:14.96
These guys are in horror.

2308
03:18:14.96 --> 03:18:15.96
Yeah.

2309
03:18:15.96 --> 03:18:19.68
And you just don't know what, I mean, and eventually it's like, okay, well, eventually you have

2310
03:18:19.68 --> 03:18:22.72
to have the attitude of, well, if it hits, it hits.

2311
03:18:22.72 --> 03:18:23.72
Yeah.

2312
03:18:23.72 --> 03:18:26.08
Otherwise I'm going to keep running around with my radio on John Duffy style and just

2313
03:18:26.08 --> 03:18:28.28
keep calling for fire.

2314
03:18:28.28 --> 03:18:31.96
Or you go like, you know how your mind kind of goes in two directions where it's either

2315
03:18:31.96 --> 03:18:34.76
get to you, do it or it gets like over one.

2316
03:18:34.76 --> 03:18:35.76
Yeah.

2317
03:18:35.76 --> 03:18:37.44
Like, yeah, your mind gets overcome.

2318
03:18:37.44 --> 03:18:40.36
So like you go nuts, you go crazy kind of thing.

2319
03:18:40.36 --> 03:18:41.36
Holy cow.

2320
03:18:41.36 --> 03:18:42.36
Yeah.

2321
03:18:42.36 --> 03:18:48.000
And then, and then here's something I can't really relate to, but flying in a helicopter

2322
03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:53.44
while there's 51 caliber machine guns trying to shoot you out of the sky.

2323
03:18:53.44 --> 03:18:54.44
Yeah.

2324
03:18:54.44 --> 03:18:56.16
That's beautiful.

2325
03:18:56.16 --> 03:18:59.80
Like, and you don't even know where they are until they're shooting at you.

2326
03:18:59.80 --> 03:19:01.76
That's how you get them is they start shooting.

2327
03:19:01.76 --> 03:19:02.92
You see their tracers.

2328
03:19:02.92 --> 03:19:03.92
Yeah.

2329
03:19:03.92 --> 03:19:07.44
You cross your fingers that they don't, the tracers don't hit you and then you engage

2330
03:19:07.44 --> 03:19:09.12
them back.

2331
03:19:09.12 --> 03:19:11.72
Yeah.

2332
03:19:11.72 --> 03:19:17.36
Silver star citation for Captain Reader for gallantry in action against North Vietnamese

2333
03:19:17.36 --> 03:19:22.92
Army forces 14 April 1972 while serving as a helicopter pilot supporting the combat actions

2334
03:19:22.92 --> 03:19:26.72
of friendly Vietnamese forces in Can Thu province, Republic of Vietnam.

2335
03:19:26.72 --> 03:19:31.44
The outnumbered ground forces were under heavy artillery fires surrounded by anti-aircraft

2336
03:19:31.44 --> 03:19:33.68
weapons and under attack by enemy forces.

2337
03:19:33.68 --> 03:19:37.72
Captain Reader took out a number of lethal guns all while under intense fire from multiple

2338
03:19:37.72 --> 03:19:40.72
anti-aircraft positions and small caliber weapons.

2339
03:19:40.72 --> 03:19:44.88
After rearming and refueling Captain Reader's team voluntarily returned once again to engage

2340
03:19:44.88 --> 03:19:50.80
the enemy in extraordinarily poor conditions of low clouds, haze, smoke and deepening darkness.

2341
03:19:50.80 --> 03:19:53.20
His team prevented the friendly force from being overrun.

2342
03:19:53.20 --> 03:19:57.88
Captain Reader's actions contributed to the escape of dozens of friendly forces and one

2343
03:19:57.88 --> 03:19:59.88
American soldier.

2344
03:19:59.88 --> 03:20:05.52
His extraordinary heroism and selfless sacrifice reflect great credit upon himself.

2345
03:20:05.52 --> 03:20:11.92
The 361st aviation company and the United States Army.

2346
03:20:11.92 --> 03:20:16.88
And what's wild, that doesn't do this any justice at all.

2347
03:20:16.88 --> 03:20:23.76
You'd have to go and set up some sort of live simulation where they're shooting 50 caliber

2348
03:20:23.76 --> 03:20:26.88
rounds near you to understand what this is.

2349
03:20:26.88 --> 03:20:31.92
But then it's also interesting that he obviously received this award and then goes back and

2350
03:20:31.92 --> 03:20:36.92
just digs out and finds all this more even information about what he didn't even know

2351
03:20:36.92 --> 03:20:37.92
how bad it was.

2352
03:20:37.92 --> 03:20:38.92
He said it.

2353
03:20:38.92 --> 03:20:39.92
He's like, I didn't know how bad it was.

2354
03:20:39.92 --> 03:20:42.48
He just sees darkness and he's shooting.

2355
03:20:42.48 --> 03:20:48.20
He doesn't even know that he's killing hundreds of enemy attackers.

2356
03:20:48.20 --> 03:20:54.80
So just awesome to be able to have a person like that here to share stories with us.

2357
03:20:54.80 --> 03:20:58.000
If you haven't listened to podcast 63 yet, go listen to it.

2358
03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:03.56
That was that's what he went through is crazy.

2359
03:21:03.56 --> 03:21:04.56
It's crazy.

2360
03:21:04.56 --> 03:21:08.56
I was I was reading through that book again.

2361
03:21:08.56 --> 03:21:12.64
He thought he was going on, they told him is going to be an 11 day march to get from

2362
03:21:12.64 --> 03:21:15.52
the prison camp he was in and in the South to get to the North.

2363
03:21:15.52 --> 03:21:19.04
They told him is 11 days and it being he didn't know if he was going to be able to make 11

2364
03:21:19.04 --> 03:21:20.04
days.

2365
03:21:20.04 --> 03:21:21.04
He's like, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this.

2366
03:21:21.04 --> 03:21:22.04
He was wounded.

2367
03:21:22.04 --> 03:21:23.04
He had dysentery.

2368
03:21:23.04 --> 03:21:24.32
He was famished.

2369
03:21:24.32 --> 03:21:27.40
He had infections all over his body.

2370
03:21:27.40 --> 03:21:32.76
His ankle was like destroyed from his plane crash or from his helicopter crash.

2371
03:21:32.76 --> 03:21:36.000
So he doesn't think he's going to make it for 11 days.

2372
03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:43.88
It ends up being four months of walking forced road march and all that started just a couple

2373
03:21:43.88 --> 03:21:47.44
weeks after this happened.

2374
03:21:47.44 --> 03:21:50.28
So all right.

2375
03:21:50.28 --> 03:21:52.28
Thanks for listening to podcasts.

2376
03:21:52.28 --> 03:21:57.52
If you want to support the podcast and you want to support yourself, get yourself some

2377
03:21:57.52 --> 03:21:59.40
chocolate fuel.

2378
03:21:59.40 --> 03:22:02.48
By the way, the drinks taste good now.

2379
03:22:02.48 --> 03:22:05.52
You know what I'm saying?

2380
03:22:05.52 --> 03:22:07.20
I know what you're saying.

2381
03:22:07.20 --> 03:22:11.20
We reformulated all.

2382
03:22:11.20 --> 03:22:12.20
Jaco Displingo.

2383
03:22:12.20 --> 03:22:14.52
We reformulated all the taste.

2384
03:22:14.52 --> 03:22:15.52
Noticeably too.

2385
03:22:15.52 --> 03:22:16.92
That's a thing to extreme.

2386
03:22:16.92 --> 03:22:18.76
It's not the kind of where, oh, okay.

2387
03:22:18.76 --> 03:22:19.76
You know, you what?

2388
03:22:19.76 --> 03:22:20.76
You added some more.

2389
03:22:20.76 --> 03:22:22.12
Whatever you guys add.

2390
03:22:22.12 --> 03:22:24.12
We reformulated the flavors.

2391
03:22:24.12 --> 03:22:25.12
Yeah.

2392
03:22:25.12 --> 03:22:26.12
It's a whole new deal.

2393
03:22:26.12 --> 03:22:29.44
And it used to be, hey, you may or may not like this flavor.

2394
03:22:29.44 --> 03:22:32.40
You may or may not like you might actually not like this.

2395
03:22:32.40 --> 03:22:34.64
Now it's like you're going to like them all.

2396
03:22:34.64 --> 03:22:38.84
They'll all be a nine and then one of them is going to be an 11 and that'll be your go-to.

2397
03:22:38.84 --> 03:22:39.84
Yep.

2398
03:22:39.84 --> 03:22:41.16
And we all know which one that is.

2399
03:22:41.16 --> 03:22:42.84
And but here's the thing though, too.

2400
03:22:42.84 --> 03:22:44.64
I like the mango now.

2401
03:22:44.64 --> 03:22:47.12
I didn't like the mango at all before.

2402
03:22:47.12 --> 03:22:49.12
That was kind of your jam.

2403
03:22:49.12 --> 03:22:51.12
Now it's our jam.

2404
03:22:51.12 --> 03:22:52.12
It's kind of our jam.

2405
03:22:52.12 --> 03:22:54.80
The sleeper is going to be dax-avaged to go to Meyer.

2406
03:22:54.80 --> 03:22:58.28
That one is just a whole other level.

2407
03:22:58.28 --> 03:23:01.80
It's still, to me anyway, the ones that actually I didn't taste them all.

2408
03:23:01.80 --> 03:23:06.28
I tasted the mango and one other one.

2409
03:23:06.28 --> 03:23:11.44
And they taste, to me, the same flavor just harder in that direction where it's like a

2410
03:23:11.44 --> 03:23:14.48
good, like more robust.

2411
03:23:14.48 --> 03:23:17.20
Just to be straight up, just to cut through whatever it is you're trying to say.

2412
03:23:17.20 --> 03:23:19.36
They're all sweeter now.

2413
03:23:19.36 --> 03:23:23.80
They're all, they all taste sweeter and sweeter taste better.

2414
03:23:23.80 --> 03:23:28.32
So yeah, thejockofuel.com, if you want to get some good tasting stuff.

2415
03:23:28.32 --> 03:23:32.04
Mulk, by the way, don't ever forget about mulk.

2416
03:23:32.04 --> 03:23:35.40
You can't forget about the mulk.

2417
03:23:35.40 --> 03:23:41.88
Because when you think and I need that sweetness, the dessert style, what is it called?

2418
03:23:41.88 --> 03:23:45.36
It's kind of savory and sweet at the same time.

2419
03:23:45.36 --> 03:23:47.24
You're getting both.

2420
03:23:47.24 --> 03:23:52.72
Jockofuel.com, you can get mulk, you can get joint warfare, super krill.

2421
03:23:52.72 --> 03:23:55.76
Just good stuff for you.

2422
03:23:55.76 --> 03:24:00.92
But what I'm going to stand by, we don't cut any corners.

2423
03:24:00.92 --> 03:24:05.64
There's so many corners to cut when it comes to making supplements.

2424
03:24:05.64 --> 03:24:07.20
There's so many corners that you can cut.

2425
03:24:07.20 --> 03:24:10.28
We're not cutting any of them on the drinks.

2426
03:24:10.28 --> 03:24:11.40
We're not cutting any of them on.

2427
03:24:11.40 --> 03:24:13.12
Jock of Discipline Go, there's no corners been cut.

2428
03:24:13.12 --> 03:24:17.76
We can easily squeeze another six cents out of this or four cents.

2429
03:24:17.76 --> 03:24:19.16
No, we're not doing that.

2430
03:24:19.16 --> 03:24:20.60
We're giving you monk fruit.

2431
03:24:20.60 --> 03:24:21.60
We're pasteurizing.

2432
03:24:21.60 --> 03:24:22.60
That's what we're doing.

2433
03:24:22.60 --> 03:24:23.60
It's across the board.

2434
03:24:23.60 --> 03:24:28.36
So there you go, jockofuel.com, good vitamin shop, you can get the drinks at Wawa.

2435
03:24:28.36 --> 03:24:31.60
You know we have a ready to drink protein coming too.

2436
03:24:31.60 --> 03:24:32.60
Do you know that?

2437
03:24:32.60 --> 03:24:33.60
Yes.

2438
03:24:33.60 --> 03:24:34.60
A perfect mix.

2439
03:24:34.60 --> 03:24:37.80
Well then in, is there such thing?

2440
03:24:37.80 --> 03:24:42.88
In my household recently, I got just cut back from a trip.

2441
03:24:42.88 --> 03:24:45.12
Mulk is heavy in the rotation now.

2442
03:24:45.12 --> 03:24:48.44
You get back on the program, you understand.

2443
03:24:48.44 --> 03:24:54.32
For those of us who may or may not have fallen off the program for a week or two, whatever,

2444
03:24:54.32 --> 03:24:56.08
nonetheless, mulk is back in.

2445
03:24:56.08 --> 03:24:59.72
But the point is there is no perfect mix though.

2446
03:24:59.72 --> 03:25:01.20
Can there be a perfect mix?

2447
03:25:01.20 --> 03:25:05.16
If there is, it's in the RTD, the right to drink that you can roll in and just get one.

2448
03:25:05.16 --> 03:25:06.16
That would make sense.

2449
03:25:06.16 --> 03:25:10.20
Like the most, what do you say, the most accepted, the most desirable mix.

2450
03:25:10.20 --> 03:25:12.36
The peak of the bell curve flavor.

2451
03:25:12.36 --> 03:25:13.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2452
03:25:13.36 --> 03:25:16.88
Because sometimes you want to add a little bit of something in there.

2453
03:25:16.88 --> 03:25:17.88
You want to add a banana.

2454
03:25:17.88 --> 03:25:20.84
You want to add, you know, depends on your mood, is what I'm saying.

2455
03:25:20.84 --> 03:25:22.60
But it'll be accepted widely.

2456
03:25:22.60 --> 03:25:23.60
We'll say that.

2457
03:25:23.60 --> 03:25:26.28
We're rolling also, HEB down in Texas.

2458
03:25:26.28 --> 03:25:27.28
Yeah.

2459
03:25:27.28 --> 03:25:28.28
We're wearing there.

2460
03:25:28.28 --> 03:25:32.76
We're starting to hit the major retailers across the country, convenience stores across

2461
03:25:32.76 --> 03:25:33.76
the country.

2462
03:25:33.76 --> 03:25:34.76
We're starting to get in there.

2463
03:25:34.76 --> 03:25:36.000
So appreciate the support there.

2464
03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:37.000
OriginUSA.com.

2465
03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:41.000
We're making Jujitsu Gis in America.

2466
03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:43.64
We're making Boots in America.

2467

We're making Jeans in America.

2468
03:25:45.48 --> 03:25:47.84

2471
03:25:51.52 --> 03:25:53.32
So I was wearing Delta.

2472
03:25:53.32 --> 03:25:54.32
Okay.

2473
03:25:54.32 --> 03:25:56.44
So my last day in Hawaii, we were flying out.

2474
03:25:56.44 --> 03:25:57.68
We had an afternoon flight.

2475
03:25:57.68 --> 03:26:01.28
So we go, we go, you know, my kids want to get shave ice and we'll go shopping, but

2476
03:26:01.28 --> 03:26:04.84
I'm wearing the, you know, so I'm wearing Delta 68 jean.

2477
03:26:04.84 --> 03:26:08.84
You know how they're like, they look real nice.

2478
03:26:08.84 --> 03:26:12.28
And you know, you usually know why you wear a surf shorts or something like this, right?

2479
03:26:12.28 --> 03:26:15.12
But I'm wearing the like the jeans and like shoes because I'm going to the airport.

2480
03:26:15.12 --> 03:26:17.08
You know, it's a whole thing.

2481
03:26:17.08 --> 03:26:26.48
So my brother's mother-in-law and the cousin, his wife's cousin was, we ran into them at

2482
03:26:26.48 --> 03:26:27.48
the mall.

2483
03:26:27.48 --> 03:26:29.08
They're like, Oh, what are you all dressed up?

2484
03:26:29.08 --> 03:26:32.64
All I had was the Delta 68.

2485
03:26:32.64 --> 03:26:34.80
That's the way my kids aren't so much anymore.

2486
03:26:34.80 --> 03:26:39.12
But if my kids saw me wearing jeans, they would be like, Oh, daddy, why are you so dressed

2487
03:26:39.12 --> 03:26:40.12
up?

2488
03:26:40.12 --> 03:26:46.20
Cause they'd never see me in anything else but surf shorts, flip flops, t-shirt.

03:26:57.12 --> 03:26:59.40
We got three versions now.

2499
03:26:59.40 --> 03:27:00.40
Got an updated version.

2500
03:27:00.40 --> 03:27:02.12
It's called standard issue.

2501
03:27:02.12 --> 03:27:03.12
A standard ish.

2502
03:27:03.12 --> 03:27:04.12
Standard issue.

2503
03:27:04.12 --> 03:27:05.12
Yeah.

2504
03:27:05.12 --> 03:27:06.12
It's like, this is the kind.

2505
03:27:06.12 --> 03:27:07.12
This is the one that.

2506
03:27:07.12 --> 03:27:08.12
Wait, the standard issue is new.

2507
03:27:08.12 --> 03:27:09.12
Is new.

2508
03:27:09.12 --> 03:27:10.12
Yeah.

2509
03:27:10.12 --> 03:27:11.12
Then you see the concept is new.

2510
03:27:11.12 --> 03:27:12.88
I will put it this way.

2511
03:27:12.88 --> 03:27:16.76
The concept I feel like should have always been there and we never had it.

2512
03:27:16.76 --> 03:27:17.76
That's what I felt.

2513
03:27:17.76 --> 03:27:18.76
I felt like it was lacking.

2514
03:27:18.76 --> 03:27:20.32
So it's a standard issue.

2515
03:27:20.32 --> 03:27:22.52
I don't think I've seen this one yet.

2516
03:27:22.52 --> 03:27:23.52
No, brand new.

2517
03:27:23.52 --> 03:27:24.52
Okay.

2518
03:27:24.52 --> 03:27:28.76
So there's some, some color schemes in there you may or may not recognize.

2519
03:27:28.76 --> 03:27:34.68
Hey in the industry, don't they say color ways?

2520
03:27:34.68 --> 03:27:35.68
That sounds familiar.

2521
03:27:35.68 --> 03:27:37.56
You got some color ways.

2522
03:27:37.56 --> 03:27:39.04
Oh, don't do it.

2523
03:27:39.04 --> 03:27:41.04
Don't do it to me.

2524
03:27:41.04 --> 03:27:42.04
Don't do it to me.

2525
03:27:42.04 --> 03:27:43.04
I thought it up.

2526
03:27:43.04 --> 03:27:44.04
Not even rethrowing it out there.

2527
03:27:44.04 --> 03:27:45.04
I'm gonna.

2528
03:27:45.04 --> 03:27:47.08
I got to sell more official something.

2529
03:27:47.08 --> 03:27:48.16
But you might recognize them.

2530
03:27:48.16 --> 03:27:53.24
So whichever one resonates with you, that's the one you're going to want to get.

2531
03:27:53.24 --> 03:27:54.92
If not, you know, multiple, whatever.

2532
03:27:54.92 --> 03:28:00.24
Either way, we got some shirts, hats hoodies, they say good, you know, you just want to

2533
03:28:00.24 --> 03:28:01.24
represent.

2534
03:28:01.24 --> 03:28:02.24
If you want to represent the path.

2535
03:28:02.24 --> 03:28:03.24
Do you have a hat?

2536
03:28:03.24 --> 03:28:05.24
A hat that says good?

2537
03:28:05.24 --> 03:28:06.24
No.

2538
03:28:06.24 --> 03:28:07.24
It might be a thing to get.

2539
03:28:07.24 --> 03:28:08.24
It's possible.

2540
03:28:08.24 --> 03:28:09.24
Going.

2541
03:28:09.24 --> 03:28:10.24
Yeah.

2542
03:28:10.24 --> 03:28:11.24
Okay.

2543
03:28:11.24 --> 03:28:14.24
So the shirt locker, the subscription, the one shirt every month.

2544
03:28:14.24 --> 03:28:17.04
So these are different, little bit different designs, a little bit different.

2545
03:28:17.04 --> 03:28:18.76
People like these designs.

2546
03:28:18.76 --> 03:28:24.04
Even people who don't know about it, they ask in my experience, people have asked, where

2547
03:28:24.04 --> 03:28:25.04
did you get that shirt?

2548
03:28:25.04 --> 03:28:26.04
For real?

2549
03:28:26.04 --> 03:28:27.04
I'm not joking.

2550
03:28:27.04 --> 03:28:29.28
But yeah, you get a new design every month.

2551
03:28:29.28 --> 03:28:30.28
That one's a good one.

2552
03:28:30.28 --> 03:28:31.76
So check that out too if you like that one.

2553
03:28:31.76 --> 03:28:32.76

Such an amazing human being, such an amazing man, such an incredible attitude.

2609
03:30:52.68 --> 03:30:59.28
And thanks of course to the brave Major John Duffy, Major Le Van May, and the rest of our

2610
03:30:59.28 --> 03:31:06.52
allies, our brave allies in the 11th Airborne Battalion who fought so valiantly and to all

2611
03:31:06.52 --> 03:31:11.32
the veterans of that war in Vietnam who did their best to protect freedom in the world.

2612
03:31:11.32 --> 03:31:17.44
And thanks to all the military personnel around the world right now fighting to do the same.

2613
03:31:17.44 --> 03:31:21.84
And the same goes to our police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

2614
03:31:21.84 --> 03:31:26.56
correctional officers, Border Patrol, Secret Service, all first responders.

2615
03:31:26.56 --> 03:31:31.16
Thanks for what you do to keep us safe here at home.

2616
03:31:31.16 --> 03:31:35.40
And everyone else, I want to leave you with part of Colonel William Reader's witness

2617
03:31:35.40 --> 03:31:41.44
statement concerning John Duffy's heroic behavior on Charlie Hill.

2618
03:31:41.44 --> 03:31:48.08
He says, quote, by the time our fire team of Cobra gunships returned to Charlie, the

2619
03:31:48.08 --> 03:31:51.32
situation had deteriorated dramatically.

2620
03:31:51.32 --> 03:31:53.68
When we arrived, it was dusk.

2621
03:31:53.68 --> 03:31:59.44
Major Duffy had directed other attack helicopters in our absence and employed a one sky raiders

2622
03:31:59.44 --> 03:32:02.52
and jet fighters around the fire base as well.

2623
03:32:02.52 --> 03:32:08.000
Nonetheless, the enemy continued their attack in the situation for Major deaf Duffy and his

2624
03:32:08.000 --> 03:32:10.48
airborne battalion was deteriorating.

2625
03:32:10.48 --> 03:32:15.20
The South Vietnamese defenders were being killed and their positions being overrun.

2626
03:32:15.20 --> 03:32:20.64
Major Duffy told us he was wounded, but would continue to work us.

2627
03:32:20.64 --> 03:32:27.36
His focus on the radio was entirely on doing what he could for his South Vietnamese comrades.

2628
03:32:27.36 --> 03:32:33.16
At times, while he had his microphone keyed directing us, I could hear him giving orders

2629
03:32:33.16 --> 03:32:37.84
to his counterparts who were fighting for their lives.

2630
03:32:37.84 --> 03:32:43.28
I could also hear him dealing with casualties that were occurring all around him.

2631
03:32:43.28 --> 03:32:48.52
I never heard him express any concern for himself.

2632
03:32:48.52 --> 03:32:52.08
He would not ask for his own extraction.

2633
03:32:52.08 --> 03:32:57.80
He seemed committed to fighting to the death with his battalion.

2634
03:32:57.80 --> 03:33:03.84
As the situation deteriorated further, he began asking for us to place our fire within

2635
03:33:03.84 --> 03:33:08.08
three meters of his position.

2636
03:33:08.08 --> 03:33:14.32
I have never seen greater bravery displayed in combat.

2637
03:33:14.32 --> 03:33:17.52
End quote.

2638
03:33:17.52 --> 03:33:20.36
So there you go.

2639
03:33:20.36 --> 03:33:23.64
There's the standard.

2640
03:33:23.64 --> 03:33:27.40
Now go live better.

2641
03:33:27.40 --> 03:33:49.04
Until next time, Zeko and Jaco, out.
