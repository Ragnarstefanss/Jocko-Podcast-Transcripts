00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.74 This is Jockelpont Cas number 325.
00:00:02.74 --> 00:00:05.12 With echo trails and me, Jockel Willing.
00:00:05.12 --> 00:00:06.12 Good evening, echo.
00:00:06.12 --> 00:00:07.12 Good evening.
00:00:07.12 --> 00:00:11.04 And also, joining us again tonight is Jason Gardner.
00:00:11.04 --> 00:00:12.04 Good evening, Jason.
00:00:12.04 --> 00:00:13.04 Good evening.
00:00:13.04 --> 00:00:26.64 Chicago Times Special Camp Robinson, Nebraska May 24th, 1877.
00:00:26.64 --> 00:00:33.72 Your correspondent has obtained some very valuable information in regard to the Custer massacre
00:00:33.72 --> 00:00:41.32 from crazy horse, through horned horse as his spokesman, which is authentic and confirmed
00:00:41.32 --> 00:00:44.64 by other principal chiefs.
00:00:44.64 --> 00:00:47.52 I interviewed the chiefs this afternoon.
00:00:47.52 --> 00:00:51.96 Lieutenant Clark arranging for the meeting in William Hunter acting as interpreter
00:00:51.96 --> 00:00:58.48 a man perfectly reliable and thoroughly converse in the Indian language.
00:00:58.48 --> 00:01:01.56 This is the Indian version and the first published.
00:01:01.56 --> 00:01:06.92 The attack was made on the village by a strong force at 11 o'clock in the morning at the
00:01:06.92 --> 00:01:10.28 upper end of the village.
00:01:10.28 --> 00:01:16.08 This was the force commanded by Major Reno and very shortly afterward the lower end of the
00:01:16.08 --> 00:01:21.92 village was attacked by another strong force that commanded by Custer.
00:01:21.92 --> 00:01:27.04 The village was divided into seven different bands of Indians each commanded by a separate
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:32.16 chief and extended in nearly a straight line.
00:01:32.16 --> 00:01:40.56 The village consisted of 18 hundred lodges and at least 400 wicky ups, a lodge made of
00:01:40.56 --> 00:01:43.84 small poles and willows for temporary shelter.
00:01:43.84 --> 00:01:48.92 Each of the wicky ups contained four young bucks and the estimate made by crazy horses
00:01:48.92 --> 00:01:54.68 that each lodge had from three to four warriors.
00:01:54.68 --> 00:02:00.64 Estimating at three made a fighting force of seven thousand Indians.
00:02:00.64 --> 00:02:05.40 This is the lowest estimate that can be made for there were a good many Indians without
00:02:05.40 --> 00:02:12.68 shelter hangers on who fought when called upon and the usual number was much above seven
00:02:12.68 --> 00:02:14.68 thousand.
00:02:14.68 --> 00:02:21.56 The attack was a surprise and totally unlipped for when Custer made the charge the women
00:02:21.56 --> 00:02:27.48 proposes children and in fact all that were not fighters made a stampede in an orderly
00:02:27.48 --> 00:02:29.24 direction.
00:02:29.24 --> 00:02:33.48 Custer seemed so numerous about a mistook them for the main body of Indians retreating
00:02:33.48 --> 00:02:37.92 and abandoning their villages and immediately gave pursuit.
00:02:37.92 --> 00:02:42.36 The warriors in the village seeing this divided their forces into two parts.
00:02:42.36 --> 00:02:47.96 One intercepting Custer between their non-combatants and him and the other getting his in his
00:02:47.96 --> 00:02:49.84 rear.
00:02:49.84 --> 00:02:58.68 Outnumbering him as they did they had him at their mercy and the dreadful massacre ensued.
00:02:58.68 --> 00:03:04.32 Horned horse says the smoke and dust were so great that folk could not be distinguished
00:03:04.32 --> 00:03:05.32 from friend.
00:03:05.32 --> 00:03:08.24 The horses were wild with fright and uncontrollable.
00:03:08.24 --> 00:03:12.16 The Indians were knocking each other from their steeds and it is an absolute fact
00:03:12.16 --> 00:03:17.36 that several young bucks in their excitement and fury killed each other, several dead Indians
00:03:17.36 --> 00:03:20.92 being found killed by arrows.
00:03:20.92 --> 00:03:26.72 Horned horse represented this hell of fire and smoke and death by intertwining his fingers
00:03:26.72 --> 00:03:33.08 and saying just like this Indians and white men.
00:03:33.08 --> 00:03:38.84 These chiefs say they suffered a loss of 58 killed and over 60 wounded.
00:03:38.84 --> 00:03:45.72 And their way of expressing it I should judge that about 60% of their wounded died.
00:03:45.72 --> 00:03:50.04 While this butcher he was going on, Reno was fighting in the upper part of the village but
00:03:50.04 --> 00:03:56.96 did not get in so far as to get surrounded and manage to escape.
00:03:56.96 --> 00:04:02.84 They say had he got in his far, he would have suffered the same fate as Custer but he
00:04:02.84 --> 00:04:08.48 retreated to the Bluffs and was held there until Indians fighting Custer.
00:04:08.48 --> 00:04:15.60 Rising over half the village could join the northern portion in besieging him.
00:04:15.60 --> 00:04:21.28 These Indians claim that but for the time the arrival of General Terry they would have
00:04:21.28 --> 00:04:23.56 certainly got Reno.
00:04:23.56 --> 00:04:29.68 They would have surrounded and stormed him out or would have besieged and eventually captured
00:04:29.68 --> 00:04:31.60 him.
00:04:31.60 --> 00:04:37.96 From what I know of crazy horse I should say that he no doubt is capable of conducting a siege.
00:04:37.96 --> 00:04:46.000 In both the Rose Bud fight and the Custer massacre the Indians claim that crazy horse
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.36 rode unarmed in the thickest of the fight invoking the blessing of the great spirit on
00:04:51.36 --> 00:05:05.60 himself that if he was right he might be victorious and if wrong that he might be killed.
00:05:05.60 --> 00:05:12.40 So that right there is an excerpt from a book called I fought with Custer which we covered
00:05:12.40 --> 00:05:16.44 on this podcast podcast number 48.
00:05:16.44 --> 00:05:21.64 You might want to go check that one out and that's from a section that we actually didn't
00:05:21.64 --> 00:05:23.64 cover on the podcast.
00:05:23.64 --> 00:05:27.60 The section of the book that's called They fought against Custer and it's got a bunch
00:05:27.60 --> 00:05:35.44 of firsthand accounts from the Indians that fought against Custer.
00:05:35.44 --> 00:05:41.20 And I didn't cover that section because we had already covered the Native American perspective
00:05:41.20 --> 00:05:50.12 in podcast 45 where we discussed the book called Wooden Leg who was a northern Cheyenne
00:05:50.12 --> 00:05:55.88 Indian who fought against Custer at Little Big Horn.
00:05:55.88 --> 00:05:58.76 And that's a good podcast to listen to.
00:05:58.76 --> 00:06:04.04 I've got quite a few seal friends that that's one of their favorite podcasts.
00:06:04.04 --> 00:06:12.28 But this man that gets mentioned here this warrior he's mentioned in both those books.
00:06:12.28 --> 00:06:19.80 And he's mentioned pretty quickly in both the books but he's someone that is definitely
00:06:19.80 --> 00:06:27.28 worth exploring as a warrior as a man and as a leader and Jason you sent me a great
00:06:27.28 --> 00:06:30.28 book while back called the Journey of Crazy Horse.
00:06:30.28 --> 00:06:38.32 This book is written by a guy named Joseph M. Marshall the third who himself is a member
00:06:38.32 --> 00:06:39.80 of the Lakota tribe.
00:06:39.80 --> 00:06:49.62 He was raised on the Rosebud Indian reservation in South Dakota and he kind of reports
00:06:49.62 --> 00:06:58.28 on or explores his journey of discovering and understanding crazy horse and starts off
00:06:58.28 --> 00:07:08.52 with a certain image of crazy horse and then learns more about him over time.
00:07:08.52 --> 00:07:16.68 Kind of going from a legend held aloft sort of above being human to being a warrior to being
00:07:16.68 --> 00:07:21.40 a leader and then ultimately understanding him as a man.
00:07:21.40 --> 00:07:25.52 And much of what he's you know I always like to do the first person accounting that's
00:07:25.52 --> 00:07:36.28 what I'm always trying to get for the podcast and this much of what Joseph talks about.
00:07:36.28 --> 00:07:41.24 Joseph Marshall talks about is stuff that was passed to him through his elders through
00:07:41.24 --> 00:07:49.92 oral history and that's I think what allows this book to come to life so well so guess
00:07:49.92 --> 00:08:00.44 we dive into the journey of the journey of crazy horse by Joseph M. Marshall the third.
00:08:00.44 --> 00:08:01.84 Where did you find this book originally?
00:08:01.84 --> 00:08:09.84 So I got a buddy that lives in Iowa, Chris Anderson and he sent me this book to read
00:08:09.84 --> 00:08:11.80 it was like how you need to check this out.
00:08:11.80 --> 00:08:19.32 So about two years ago I knocked it out on audible and then as we started to do the you
00:08:19.32 --> 00:08:23.48 know we're doing the battlefield a little big one you know I'm like well I want to understand
00:08:23.48 --> 00:08:28.36 more about the for everything that cost her did wrong there's stuff that's sitting
00:08:28.36 --> 00:08:33.40 born crazy horse we're doing right now I want to try to understand more that so I hit
00:08:33.40 --> 00:08:37.40 this book up and then it made sense for something that we could talk about here especially
00:08:37.40 --> 00:08:43.12 because it's from the Lakota perspective and brought down from their oral history.
00:08:43.12 --> 00:08:48.32 Yeah the we're so the battlefield that you're talking about this is an event that we do
00:08:48.32 --> 00:08:52.40 at echelon front where we go and look at the we go and walk the battlefield and there's
00:08:52.40 --> 00:08:54.40 all these leaders to learn from.
00:08:54.40 --> 00:09:00.24 I mean we do get his bird and this would be the first one that the first series that we're
00:09:00.24 --> 00:09:03.32 going to do up at a little big horn.
00:09:03.32 --> 00:09:08.80 So going out there understanding the personalities of these individuals gives you so much
00:09:08.80 --> 00:09:13.84 more depth into understanding their leadership decisions and the decisions that they made
00:09:13.84 --> 00:09:20.64 you can start to identify how their personalities impacted their decisions and then you
00:09:20.64 --> 00:09:26.56 can look at yourself and say what part of my personality is impacting my decision and we
00:09:26.56 --> 00:09:32.08 I haven't been to live you've been a little big horn yet yeah I have same kind of spiritual
00:09:33.44 --> 00:09:39.20 impact as get his bird yes and it's incredible because you you can sit you can sit in the
00:09:39.20 --> 00:09:45.12 gully where Reno had hit they well they came across a came across river and attacked the south
00:09:45.12 --> 00:09:48.88 end of the camp because initially they could only see a portion of it and thought it was
00:09:48.88 --> 00:09:54.32 much smaller and then they'd the morons didn't listen to their crow scouts who said whoa that's
00:09:54.32 --> 00:10:01.36 a much bigger in cabin than you think it is and you you can see all these spots and and it's
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:06.24 just it's it's it's it's it's it's really humbling to be able to see it and talk about it
00:10:06.24 --> 00:10:12.08 and discuss what's going on and and feel the energy it was there yeah I'm looking forward to
00:10:12.08 --> 00:10:17.36 what when we doing that August it's August yeah all right so let's get into this book
00:10:18.72 --> 00:10:24.000 here we go crazy horses been my hero since I was a boy he was arguably the best known
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.24 Lakota leader in the latter half of the 19th century a turbulent time on the northern plains
00:10:30.24 --> 00:10:34.08 at first I knew crazy horse only as a fighting man the warrior
00:10:34.08 --> 00:10:40.08 I didn't know or care what he felt what he thought I cared only that he was a Lakota
00:10:40.08 --> 00:10:43.92 and that he was brave and performed deeds that fired my imagination
00:10:45.28 --> 00:10:50.64 but it's time went on there were more stories I now know crazy horse as a man
00:10:51.84 --> 00:10:58.72 first and a legend second a very distant second in fact he is much like my father and my uncles
00:10:58.72 --> 00:11:05.20 and my all my grandfather's he walks straight he's polite and he speaks softly
00:11:06.80 --> 00:11:12.56 but there's also an aura of mystery about him as though sometimes I am seeing him in a
00:11:12.56 --> 00:11:18.16 mist that blends legend and reality it's that aura that seems to appeal to most people
00:11:18.16 --> 00:11:23.36 and I'm convinced that many want to connect with the mystery more than they want to identify
00:11:23.36 --> 00:11:29.28 with the man I can remember consciously hearing his name for the first time the summer I was six
00:11:29.28 --> 00:11:36.000 years old my grandfather Albert and a man I knew as grandpa Isaac and I had just crossed the
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.64 little white river and stopped arrest as they both fashion their role your own cigarettes one of
00:11:42.64 --> 00:11:50.48 them compared the slow the slow moving little white to the greasy grass river I learned later
00:11:50.48 --> 00:11:56.56 that the greasy grass was in south central Montana and was also known as a little big horn
00:11:57.84 --> 00:12:03.04 in the shade of a thick grove of sand bar willow the two old men spoke about a battle
00:12:03.84 --> 00:12:09.28 and names that I had never heard before or at least that I couldn't remember hearing before
00:12:09.28 --> 00:12:16.56 rolled off their tongues that day along the river one name was repeated more often than the
00:12:16.56 --> 00:12:24.32 others in the story of that battle the name his crazy horse he was a leader of fighting men
00:12:24.32 --> 00:12:29.52 and his mere appearance on the battlefield was apparently enough to inspire others to fight
00:12:30.40 --> 00:12:34.32 crazy horse had led a charge of warriors against the soldiers in the second engagement of that
00:12:34.32 --> 00:12:40.96 battle a leader commented on that particular action when recounting the battle years later by saying
00:12:40.96 --> 00:12:47.68 I have never seen anything so brave by the age of six I'd already listened to many stories from
00:12:47.68 --> 00:12:53.28 these two grandfather's I was well aware that being a fighting man was one way of being a man
00:12:53.28 --> 00:12:58.96 in the Lakota ways of old I knew that men were often injured or wounded in battle and sometimes
00:12:58.96 --> 00:13:06.24 killed and I knew that in a battle a man could prove himself for one man to obviously evoke
00:13:06.24 --> 00:13:12.96 such reverence and respect from two grandfather's who told the story of 1876 greasy grass fight
00:13:12.96 --> 00:13:20.72 the battle of little big horn was of some consequence in my six year old world I could think of only
00:13:20.72 --> 00:13:26.80 two or three other old men in the same category as these two grandfather's so when they respected
00:13:26.80 --> 00:13:35.52 someone it was no small thing that day by the little white river crazy horse became a part of my life
00:13:42.72 --> 00:13:50.32 we were having this conversation I think yesterday this idea and I think I had brought it up
00:13:50.32 --> 00:13:57.36 on some other podcast but the idea that this if you're going to go out and fight
00:13:58.32 --> 00:14:05.12 is that programmed into us is that just what we're raised with that we think hey going out and fighting
00:14:05.12 --> 00:14:10.88 and being heroic being a warrior is a cool thing is a good thing or is there some sort of
00:14:11.68 --> 00:14:19.36 genetic component to it because as a human being in a group of other human beings that are trying to
00:14:19.36 --> 00:14:27.20 survive 10,000 years ago and we're part of a gang we're part of a tribe and if Jason is the kind
00:14:27.20 --> 00:14:36.000 of guy that goes out and kills a buffalo or defends our tribe then you help us all survive and so
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.96 we're naturally we naturally intuitively instinctively elevate the people that are ready to fight
00:14:42.96 --> 00:14:51.36 and we can't even control it I don't know what do you think yeah it's it's interesting because
00:14:51.36 --> 00:14:56.96 the good hunters also translate to their good warriors right but then in their society in
00:14:56.96 --> 00:15:05.04 the Lakota Society the medicine men were also revered as well so I guess people were elevated
00:15:05.04 --> 00:15:11.04 based on whatever they brought to the community with large and then oftentimes with either the
00:15:11.04 --> 00:15:17.12 medicine men or the warriors eventually you age out of it and then they're looking at you for
00:15:18.48 --> 00:15:28.32 for your wisdom you know like Chamberlain that guy comes over from like the intellectual
00:15:28.32 --> 00:15:32.08 side of the house because he's a college professor when he joins the army so it's kind of like
00:15:32.08 --> 00:15:37.12 he wasn't really that that's what makes him so interesting and so cool is he's like good at everything
00:15:37.12 --> 00:15:42.32 every side of the Rubik's Cube you examine with that guy he's square the solid colors yeah
00:15:43.92 --> 00:15:49.68 the thing is though you have all these different societies around the world that are some of them are totally
00:15:49.68 --> 00:15:56.64 disconnected from other societies and there's like always a warrior tradition yes it leads me to believe that
00:15:56.64 --> 00:16:04.96 at least at some level human beings look at the person that's ready to stand up and fight and defend
00:16:04.96 --> 00:16:13.12 and they have an instinctual inherent elevation elevated attitude towards that person here this
00:16:13.12 --> 00:16:17.52 guy is six years old you know I'm thinking and he's hearing these stories and thinks it's cool
00:16:18.56 --> 00:16:23.92 in the parlance of our time right like hey that's wow this sounds cool what was I doing when I was
00:16:24.56 --> 00:16:34.40 eight years old watching apocalypse now thinking that's cool that guy he special forces he's going on
00:16:34.40 --> 00:16:43.12 this mission up the river that's cool I don't know I mean my dad wasn't in the military there was
00:16:43.84 --> 00:16:50.48 no my grandfather was but he wasn't super influential in my life and all of the sudden as just instinct
00:16:51.68 --> 00:16:58.40 that looks cool it yeah because it doesn't appear to be generation leaving in this case crazy
00:16:58.40 --> 00:17:06.48 horses dad is a matter of fact he's not a fighter yeah um and so you know you look at how we
00:17:07.12 --> 00:17:14.16 revere sports figures and in a lot of ways their warriors you choose a sporting team and they're
00:17:14.16 --> 00:17:17.76 the ones that are going out and doing battle with other sporting teams or rooting for them and
00:17:17.76 --> 00:17:26.24 they're who are putting up on a pedestal for the most spot it it's not that different than
00:17:26.24 --> 00:17:32.64 then combat which who's going on it's an interesting thing to discuss feels like there's an
00:17:32.64 --> 00:17:38.80 element of risk there too like so skill and then risk and sacrifice that for everybody sacrifice for
00:17:38.80 --> 00:17:46.72 everybody else and they're they're lies in why we hold up like that courage as being a value that we
00:17:47.60 --> 00:17:53.52 or something that we value right is courage yeah like if you if you're a little
00:17:53.52 --> 00:17:58.56 say like I'm a six year old or whatever and you think of some guy who goes out and kills a buffalo
00:17:58.56 --> 00:18:03.68 and then brings it back or whatever you think man if I want to try to kill a buffalo and
00:18:03.68 --> 00:18:08.40 things in a kill me you know so he's like good at what he does he's risk dying and then when he
00:18:08.40 --> 00:18:13.20 brings it back it's for all of us he's like hero you know right so kind of it's I mean that's obviously
00:18:13.20 --> 00:18:17.36 like a metaphor or the the sporting teams and stuff that's a metaphor yeah that's a big
00:18:17.36 --> 00:18:23.12 but of the same thing though yeah exactly but I and I think this is so obvious what we're saying
00:18:23.12 --> 00:18:32.64 I ask my actual question is is it instinctual is it like part of our nature
00:18:33.76 --> 00:18:39.76 that we can you know it may or may not get you know expanded upon as we grow up in some people
00:18:39.76 --> 00:18:44.40 you know being a warrior stupid why would you go and sacrifice yourself for other people like
00:18:44.40 --> 00:18:52.72 that's unattitude so you can overcome this instinct but it is kind of crazy to think hey this is
00:18:52.72 --> 00:18:59.12 the way many different societies from all different background all kind of elevate this warrior
00:18:59.12 --> 00:19:06.16 is it an in isn't a natural animal instinct to think this person's going to protect the tribe
00:19:06.16 --> 00:19:09.76 this person's going to help the tribe this person's going to feed the tribe this person's possibly
00:19:09.76 --> 00:19:13.20 going to sacrifice for themselves for the tribe and that's a positive thing we're going to
00:19:13.20 --> 00:19:18.08 elevate them because they're putting the tribe before themselves they're putting themselves at
00:19:18.08 --> 00:19:23.60 risk in order to save the tribe and that's why it's very likely instinctual and
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.12 I don't I don't I don't I think that's no matter where you look if you examine closely
00:19:31.12 --> 00:19:41.12 that's still revered today this individual human overcame the the instinct of self preservation
00:19:41.12 --> 00:19:46.80 to look out for me and look out for my family we're going to elevate that individual
00:19:48.08 --> 00:19:54.48 all right going back to the book here every Lakota baby was born with thick shiny black hair
00:19:54.48 --> 00:19:59.84 that stayed black for most of adulthood but the hair of the son of crazy horse seemed to grow
00:19:59.84 --> 00:20:04.64 lighter even as he lost his baby fat which happened to him quicker than the most children
00:20:04.64 --> 00:20:09.04 to his mother and the other women in his life it was an endearing characteristic
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:12.48 although they worried that it would prove to be troublesome for him later in life
00:20:13.36 --> 00:20:18.88 outside the reach of sharp ears he was referred to as the light-haired one
00:20:20.40 --> 00:20:29.68 to his face he was simply called Gigi or light hair so he's got a distinctive characteristic
00:20:29.68 --> 00:20:37.20 out of the gate which is also kind of interesting you know you got a my name is Joko which is
00:20:37.20 --> 00:20:40.88 a weird name and I've had that it's a nickname but it's been my nickname since I was born
00:20:40.88 --> 00:20:47.92 which meant when I met someone when I was five years old and seven years old and four years old
00:20:47.92 --> 00:20:54.96 and ten years old they would say what's your name and I had to say this weird name you know my
00:20:54.96 --> 00:20:59.60 name is Joko but that's I didn't really know that that was just a nickname it's all as a
00:20:59.60 --> 00:21:05.36 older so you kind of have to contend with this right it's kind of like oh you got to contend with this
00:21:05.36 --> 00:21:08.72 what happened in weird name you haven't weird name yes I know that did you know that yes
00:21:08.72 --> 00:21:14.40 there I did did you did you you feel that a little bit like when you were six years old yes
00:21:15.76 --> 00:21:20.80 you did now Jason was as hey I'm Jason good you have to spell it you know the mispronounce
00:21:20.80 --> 00:21:28.08 you're just good to go no so I think these kind of distinctive characteristic can sometimes help
00:21:28.88 --> 00:21:34.96 they can also sometimes I think hurt kids when you're young you got some weird like sometimes
00:21:34.96 --> 00:21:39.84 have to kids grow really tall quickly yeah and they don't they don't like it you know they feel like
00:21:39.84 --> 00:21:44.16 awkward or people are looking at them or when you get glasses right that's another thing maybe
00:21:44.16 --> 00:21:48.88 it's not that big of a deal when I was a kid like when someone had glasses they had to contend with
00:21:48.88 --> 00:21:53.92 that yeah to deal with it but they're tempering them it's making I mean that's the metaphor he uses
00:21:53.92 --> 00:22:00.24 in here that it the teasing temper's crazy horse to make him hard and it's a boy named Sue yes
00:22:00.24 --> 00:22:04.64 that's exactly what I was thinking about and his metaphor is like hanging the staff and the T.P. for
00:22:04.64 --> 00:22:10.72 five years to slowly temper it and make it harder and then you're going to carve that ass dive into a bow
00:22:13.28 --> 00:22:19.76 we were talking about buds earlier and amazed that they're still a huge attrition rate
00:22:19.76 --> 00:22:23.84 and our thoughts are it it's because a lot of the some of the folks that are there and are such
00:22:23.84 --> 00:22:29.68 good athletes that never failed anything whereas opposed when I got there and and I'd already
00:22:30.96 --> 00:22:35.52 failed it a bunch of stuff and I was used to getting beat up at getting knockdown and it's like
00:22:35.52 --> 00:22:40.56 I'm just gonna dust myself up and get moving again yeah you and I were saying that when they
00:22:40.56 --> 00:22:44.88 when the instructors looked at us and said you suck we were like yeah I know obviously
00:22:45.44 --> 00:22:52.96 but if you're like the star athlete and you get told you suck and you and then you lose the race
00:22:52.96 --> 00:22:57.20 because by the way because you're so athletic they make you do a bunch of jump squats before you do
00:22:57.20 --> 00:23:02.16 the sprint race and then you lose and then they call you loser and it's never happened before and
00:23:02.16 --> 00:23:08.40 all of a sudden you're like I this isn't for me I can't win in this arena or I'm not good enough
00:23:08.96 --> 00:23:15.12 and meanwhile you got Joe slightly below average athlete which is me just like well I'll keep going
00:23:15.12 --> 00:23:18.40 I suck yeah I know but I'm gonna keep going I'm used to this yeah yeah
00:23:18.40 --> 00:23:25.20 uh the other thing and he mentions in the book I'm not gonna highlight it but they called him
00:23:25.20 --> 00:23:31.12 the women decided to call him light hair to just get it over with it was like hey you know oh
00:23:31.44 --> 00:23:35.28 you got you look a little bit funky cool we're just gonna we're just gonna break make it
00:23:35.28 --> 00:23:40.64 where's gonna call you that just get it out in the open get the elephant yeah in the room out
00:23:41.28 --> 00:23:44.96 why not yeah isn't that what all the psychology does it's like oh you're afraid of elevator so
00:23:44.96 --> 00:23:48.56 let's make you look at a bunch of pictures elevators and eventually maybe you get in one
00:23:48.56 --> 00:23:53.84 and then late you just do graduated exposure and that's what they did here
00:23:53.84 --> 00:23:58.40 the students to work yeah it's okay to be offended everybody thank you harder
00:24:01.36 --> 00:24:06.24 there came a day when someone handed light hair a bow and a quiver of arrows to suited to his
00:24:06.24 --> 00:24:10.64 size and strength it was the first tangible sign of life that lay ahead and his mother smiled
00:24:10.64 --> 00:24:16.16 because she was proud or son would fall the path of a hunter and warrior hey the caveat obviously
00:24:16.16 --> 00:24:20.96 not reading the whole book it's an awesome book if you if it sounds a little stilted when I'm reading
00:24:20.96 --> 00:24:26.72 it like wait what's going on it's cuz I'm not reading the whole book get it and the audio book
00:24:26.72 --> 00:24:32.96 you mentioned I think the audio book is read by the author so that makes it good too change came
00:24:32.96 --> 00:24:37.36 into light hair's life and this is fast forward change came into light hair's life and yet another
00:24:37.36 --> 00:24:45.36 way she who gave him life lost her own in the perception of the child at the time the perception
00:24:45.36 --> 00:24:50.80 perception of time for a child can be often be irrelevant especially in a culture that was not
00:24:50.80 --> 00:24:55.68 given to measuring it he was too young to understand that death is a part of life later he would
00:24:55.68 --> 00:25:02.40 realize his mother's time on earth had been much too short so his mother dies when he's young
00:25:02.40 --> 00:25:11.68 fast forward a little bit more seasons turned and I just just FYI you know be in a guy that's
00:25:11.68 --> 00:25:16.08 in the language and stuff there's a whole section that this thing starts off talking about the
00:25:16.08 --> 00:25:21.36 the language the Lakota language really cool the read I'm not gonna read it for two reasons
00:25:21.36 --> 00:25:26.64 the primary reason being just me sitting here trying to pronounce these words would be a disaster
00:25:26.64 --> 00:25:33.04 uh but they add a lot to the story when you read the story so another reason to get the book
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.20 one day light hair and his sister were given new mothers they were sisters quiet and polite as they
00:25:41.20 --> 00:25:46.16 walked into the circle of their new life as the wives of crazy horse so the crazy horse that we're
00:25:46.16 --> 00:25:52.08 talking about in this particular moment is the dad the dad that you mentioned Jason is a medicine man
00:25:52.08 --> 00:25:55.92 so the dad is named crazy horse at this time and that's where they're talking about when they
00:25:55.92 --> 00:26:02.000 refer to crazy horse not light hair the son who is the crazy horse that we all know about and their
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.44 mothers and daughters of his own son um going forward a little bit more the boy didn't completely
00:26:09.44 --> 00:26:14.64 understand all about his father but he did know that crazy horse didn't hunt like the other man
00:26:14.64 --> 00:26:21.20 or go to war a father who is a medicine man and didn't do the things men did cause the boy to feel
00:26:21.20 --> 00:26:28.08 all the more different he wondered most of all why he looked different than the other boys so that's
00:26:28.08 --> 00:26:34.96 another thing in his childhood everyone's talking about my dad's in the deems or my dad's going
00:26:34.96 --> 00:26:40.72 to war and he's like well my dad's gonna go uh you know move smoke around and stuff so he feels awkward
00:26:40.72 --> 00:26:48.88 about that hunting was the Lakota lifeblood like the wolf fox eagle mountain lion and hawk
00:26:48.88 --> 00:26:53.28 the Lakota were hunters at age seven light hair realized more and more that hunting was the way to
00:26:53.28 --> 00:26:59.12 have fresh meat and deer and elk hides for clothing and buffalo hide for lodge coverings he also
00:26:59.12 --> 00:27:04.16 sense that he would be part of the process somehow like all boys light hair was becoming skilled
00:27:04.16 --> 00:27:10.80 with his bow he had progressed to a stout a stout her bow stronger than the first he was given
00:27:10.80 --> 00:27:16.16 one made in proportion to his size and strength his favorite game had changed as well shooting arrows
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:23.04 through a rolling willow hoop had become too easy in boring so his uncle little hawk and a few
00:27:23.04 --> 00:27:31.12 other men introduced him to a new game shooting at grasshoppers the rules were simple walk along the
00:27:31.12 --> 00:27:36.72 prairie with an arrow on the bow string and shoot it a grasshopper when it flew rolling hope a rolling
00:27:36.72 --> 00:27:41.20 hoop was a much easier target a grasshopper was about the size of his little finger in flew
00:27:41.20 --> 00:27:47.52 erratically and fast the men would suppress smiles when it first the boy was able to get off a shot
00:27:48.72 --> 00:27:53.84 before he could pull back the string the insect was back in the grass but as he learned to hold
00:27:53.84 --> 00:27:59.04 his bow ready he could send an arrow in the general direction of the flitting grasshopper shooting
00:27:59.04 --> 00:28:05.36 a grasshoppers was not boring it was he learned of very humbling experience as the summer war on
00:28:05.36 --> 00:28:11.84 his reaction became faster and more and more his arrows only narrowly missed grasshoppers and old
00:28:11.84 --> 00:28:20.56 man told him have much to teach awesome just awesome stuff you're going out to see
00:28:20.56 --> 00:28:25.20 Dudley aren't you and you're just thinking that I wonder if you're going to start
00:28:25.20 --> 00:28:35.52 that walking around zapping grasshopper yeah you're going to get dialed in um freaking awesome what a
00:28:36.56 --> 00:28:44.08 what a way to grow up and what a way to get good you're just that's what you do that's what you do
00:28:47.12 --> 00:28:51.76 fast forward a little bit important character comes into play as the days passed he unknowingly
00:28:51.76 --> 00:28:57.68 attracted the interest of a and curiosity of a man called high backbone the mini conjue with a
00:28:57.68 --> 00:29:05.04 ogala wife a gala wife and he liked what he saw in the shy light hair and I might I don't think
00:29:05.04 --> 00:29:13.52 I'd mention that yet so Marshall mentioned it that crazy horse is quiet and he doesn't talk a lot
00:29:13.52 --> 00:29:18.16 but they they do give some examples in the book of when he's a kid they're playing games and he's not saying
00:29:18.16 --> 00:29:24.40 anything you know he just he's a quiet he's a quiet the term he used here shy perhaps it was the
00:29:24.40 --> 00:29:31.60 boys quiet determination or is innate humility high backbone himself was a quiet man not given
00:29:31.60 --> 00:29:38.32 to pursuing the path of glory but he was deeply committed to achieving the status of wika the complete man
00:29:39.44 --> 00:29:44.64 the complete man embodied the best qualities of the hunter and the fighting man
00:29:44.64 --> 00:29:52.24 though all men necessarily filled the roles of both provider and protector the hunter warrior
00:29:52.24 --> 00:29:58.88 not everyone could achieve the highest ideals for both calling high backbone was one of the few
00:29:59.68 --> 00:30:06.96 high backbone was a leader of fighting men muscular and broad shoulder exuding the confidence of a man
00:30:06.96 --> 00:30:16.56 who not only had physical strength but also a lifetime of experience and accomplishment so this guy
00:30:16.56 --> 00:30:26.56 high backbone kind of becomes a mentor to to light hair and this idea this idea of being good
00:30:26.56 --> 00:30:32.08 and multiple phases you know it's what who you say about the ruby cube chamberland chamberland yeah
00:30:32.08 --> 00:30:37.44 because it's like you know yeah he's good on every side that you examine yeah and that's that's
00:30:37.44 --> 00:30:43.44 what high backbone has that same quality they lay out these these virtues of the wika which I
00:30:43.44 --> 00:30:50.16 thought was was really interesting on go and it's it's in the forward but it says the the virtues
00:30:50.16 --> 00:30:57.84 are generosity courage fortitude and wisdom those and the very first thing they're saying for a
00:30:57.84 --> 00:31:06.08 warrior in a man is is generosity which is pretty cool courage and fortitude and wisdom yeah
00:31:10.32 --> 00:31:16.16 fast forward a little bit like most Lakota boys approaching the age of 12 light hair was a
00:31:16.16 --> 00:31:20.08 proficient hunter like all hunters light hair learned to sit motionless and the drift would
00:31:20.08 --> 00:31:24.72 blind along a creek for the better part of an afternoon waiting for a white tail to move within
00:31:24.72 --> 00:31:29.84 effective killing range of his bow which is as far as he could throw a stone with all his might
00:31:30.56 --> 00:31:37.68 it's pretty cool that's a pretty good uh i'm thinking he's probably able to go
00:31:40.56 --> 00:31:46.80 60 yards what's your estimation oh no he's 12 years old he's 12 years old he's
00:31:46.80 --> 00:31:52.88 don't rock what do you think he could throw rock I think he's probably at 15 or 20 yards really
00:31:52.88 --> 00:31:59.04 yeah echo Charles assessment 35 40 though because think about it what's his draw what's his
00:31:59.92 --> 00:32:05.68 draw on his strength yeah 12 it's it's probably not that hard pretty small yeah that's a good point
00:32:06.64 --> 00:32:09.92 but dude we're talking about a kid that's just walking around freaking shooting grass
00:32:09.92 --> 00:32:18.08 animals all day long so well and if you heard about like the the the the old British long bow
00:32:18.08 --> 00:32:23.28 archers that had like a draw weight of 120 pounds or something and they weren't compound bows
00:32:23.28 --> 00:32:31.36 they were just drawing back that much weight yeah so the Mongols had 80 pound bows that's insane that's
00:32:31.36 --> 00:32:38.96 insane yeah um we interesting to hear what they're they're what they've someone on the other put in the
00:32:38.96 --> 00:32:48.32 column yeah someone will tell us some will tell us what the what that range was so he's hunting um
00:32:49.92 --> 00:32:55.36 here's another he's got another friend another friend named lone bear fast forward a little bit
00:32:55.36 --> 00:33:00.32 lone bear and light hair road straight to a slight rise north of the fort and this is so now there's
00:33:00.32 --> 00:33:07.68 they're they're doing exploring kind of like kid stuff and they go to look at fort lairamy
00:33:07.68 --> 00:33:15.28 warned by crazy horse that's the dad and high back bone not to go nearer but it was a good enough
00:33:15.28 --> 00:33:20.96 vantage point to see buildings in this rounding area a wide trail led to the fort from the southeast
00:33:20.96 --> 00:33:26.72 and a way to the west on the other side of the main area of activity which was among the light
00:33:26.72 --> 00:33:35.04 colored buildings and along the trail what were what they could only assumed to be abandoned wagons
00:33:35.04 --> 00:33:39.04 they resembled skeletons most of them stripped down of the frames whites were everywhere
00:33:39.92 --> 00:33:45.36 along with their horses mules oxen and cattle the occasional barking of dogs reached the boys ears
00:33:46.08 --> 00:33:51.68 south of the buildings they could see the tops of several Lakota lodges a few Lakota stayed near
00:33:51.68 --> 00:33:56.72 the fort from the days before the soldiers had taken over in the days when it was only a trade
00:33:56.72 --> 00:34:04.40 trading town now the rumors were the soldiers had come to protect the travelers along the shell river
00:34:04.40 --> 00:34:13.20 trail and again there's he gives a lot of good detail about all the way this settlement is happening
00:34:13.20 --> 00:34:18.000 the whites are coming how they're doing it what it looks like to to the Indians
00:34:22.96 --> 00:34:25.92 yeah and I'm trying to give enough that you can understand the story
00:34:26.80 --> 00:34:31.04 there's a real bad smallpox outbreak prior to this happening a lot of them are just like
00:34:31.04 --> 00:34:38.32 just I'm staying away from my people period yeah it's a white-out entire groups of people yeah
00:34:39.28 --> 00:34:46.48 yeah they're scared of that they don't want any of that the Lakota called the council at horse
00:34:46.48 --> 00:34:55.28 creek the white piece talkers called it the fort Laramie treaty council of 1851 the whites
00:34:55.28 --> 00:35:00.80 wanted three things first they wanted no more fighting among the people gathered the black
00:35:00.80 --> 00:35:06.16 fleet the black feet and the crow were called upon to live in peace with the Lakota and the
00:35:06.16 --> 00:35:12.88 Lakota were in turn to live in peace with the snakes and so on tell the wind to stop blowing
00:35:12.88 --> 00:35:19.68 some reacted or the rivers to stop flowing second the whites seem to want to say where the
00:35:19.68 --> 00:35:25.84 land ended and where it began by drawing a picture on a parched hide beyond a certain line was
00:35:25.84 --> 00:35:32.96 Crowland and behind it was black feet but who could find that line on the earth someone wondered
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.40 third the travelers on the shell river trail must not be molested they said for they were
00:35:40.40 --> 00:35:45.76 traveling under the protection of the great father who lived in some city far to the east of the
00:35:45.76 --> 00:35:50.88 grandfather river the great father would know if his people on the trail were harmed
00:35:50.88 --> 00:35:56.56 the trail must be holy in some fashion suggested an old Lakota man Riley
00:35:57.36 --> 00:36:04.48 thereafter the shell river trail became known as the holy road for green to these three things
00:36:04.48 --> 00:36:12.08 the peacetalker said the great father was empowering them to pay a new eddies that amounted to many
00:36:12.08 --> 00:36:18.40 thousands of their money in dollars the newbies would be in the form of food beef cattle flower
00:36:18.40 --> 00:36:24.40 and beans for starters and various other goods such as plows hose and other farm implements
00:36:26.24 --> 00:36:30.64 there were many raised eyebrows and helpless shrugs at the listening of listing of other goods
00:36:30.64 --> 00:36:43.84 but in the end they were accepted very very strange you know like it's just a complete
00:36:43.84 --> 00:36:53.60 it's a culture just totally separate even as you're hearing this deal you're thinking
00:36:53.60 --> 00:36:56.80 like you're going to say this land is my that's like if you came into me right now and said hey
00:36:56.80 --> 00:37:02.24 a jockel give you money for your for the air i'd say uh you want to give me money for air cool
00:37:02.88 --> 00:37:08.72 okay you give me money i then also you had some contraption that like sucked the air oh yeah exactly
00:37:08.72 --> 00:37:12.56 I was trying to wrap my head around this whole thing and you're that's exactly what's what's
00:37:12.56 --> 00:37:21.68 what's going on and it's it's clear that like the whites there they they they obviously weren't
00:37:21.68 --> 00:37:25.60 organized and sound kind screwed up too because they had their stuff they were trying to muddle
00:37:25.60 --> 00:37:30.72 their way whole things through this this whole mass on like hey we've got a newbies coming and
00:37:30.72 --> 00:37:38.96 then they don't show up and they're like uh what's uh the annuity's too is a real good you can see
00:37:38.96 --> 00:37:47.20 we're gonna see it throughout this story just the way that we as people if you become
00:37:47.20 --> 00:37:52.80 reliant on someone else if you're given stuff you become reliant and you forget how to do things for
00:37:52.80 --> 00:38:01.04 yourself you know i don't know if the grand plan of the whites was to get them hooked on these
00:38:01.04 --> 00:38:05.04 annuities and then we can just kind of take advantage of i don't know if that was their grand plan
00:38:05.04 --> 00:38:11.52 but that's what happens it definitely like it part part of a three-prong strategy one
00:38:12.32 --> 00:38:17.12 the annuities which i bet you they were just doing to kind of like calm things down but then it
00:38:17.12 --> 00:38:23.92 wound up being like what actually screwed everybody over and it's so reliveent to today
00:38:24.88 --> 00:38:31.60 right because these annuities are like the algorithms on social media or they're like fast food
00:38:31.60 --> 00:38:38.48 or all kinds of other real easy stuff that's like oh cool i'll just swing through McDonald's
00:38:38.48 --> 00:38:44.48 because i'm kind of hungry in not order something healthy off their menu and then
00:38:46.08 --> 00:38:51.76 then you messed up yeah i mean anytime this is you know if from a greater perspective
00:38:51.76 --> 00:38:56.16 communism right hey look i'm gonna pay you regardless if you do your job well or not
00:38:57.04 --> 00:39:01.44 well okay cool i'm not gonna do my job well and you're gonna pay me right that's
00:39:01.44 --> 00:39:06.72 great it happens with you know certain positions certain government positions like oh
00:39:06.72 --> 00:39:11.60 you're gonna get that you're gonna get that paycheck regardless if you're at the DMV no offense
00:39:11.60 --> 00:39:16.08 DMV but if you work at the DMV it doesn't matter if you process
00:39:17.60 --> 00:39:25.52 four license applications today or 29 what's your motivation to produce any more stuff if it's
00:39:25.52 --> 00:39:29.44 all gonna get taken from you and redistributed then you're just gonna do the minimum
00:39:29.44 --> 00:39:34.96 and i think that's what one of the reasons why colonialism is kind of falling on its
00:39:34.96 --> 00:39:43.28 face and all it is it's very disturbing so fast forward a little bit each summer's lines and
00:39:43.28 --> 00:39:47.92 lines of wagons were not the same as those that had come the summer before they carried a different
00:39:47.92 --> 00:39:53.92 group of whites who had never seen a Lakota or a Kaewa or a blue cow cloud but who had been filled
00:39:53.92 --> 00:40:00.96 with stories about the dangers from the brown skin mirotters so wide eyed and fearful of
00:40:00.96 --> 00:40:07.36 were the whites who arrived at the fort not comforted by the sites of scowling Lakota men
00:40:08.48 --> 00:40:13.36 but the Lakota were likewise troubled at the sight of so many white men some of the old ones
00:40:13.36 --> 00:40:20.96 would shake their gray heads and speak a warning in any land among any kind of people three human
00:40:20.96 --> 00:40:32.24 weaknesses are at the root of trouble fear anger and arrogance right i'll relevant is that to us today
00:40:32.80 --> 00:40:39.92 yep fear anger and arrogance those weaknesses were about to be mixed
00:40:39.92 --> 00:40:52.64 yeah fear anger and arrogance by the way root cause those obviously arrogance is ego but anger often
00:40:52.64 --> 00:41:01.52 also ego and a lot of these circumstances are very egotistical in this book that the anger is triggered
00:41:01.52 --> 00:41:07.60 from ego yeah and the hatred which i think kakana is a little bit different but you can attach it
00:41:07.60 --> 00:41:18.32 to anger and usually it's rooted in some kind of fear no life has a way of creating strange
00:41:18.32 --> 00:41:30.80 circumstances that often lead to a bad end or an unexpected turn when i read that i was like damn it
00:41:30.80 --> 00:41:38.56 you know because you don't want to admit that don't want to admit it you don't want to say you know
00:41:38.56 --> 00:41:47.04 what let's sometimes things happen that result to a bad end it's such a sad thing to think about
00:41:47.04 --> 00:41:56.72 but it's the freaking reality of life so he goes on to this section here
00:41:56.72 --> 00:42:06.32 that speaking of anger and fear and arrogance there's a there's a cow that wanders into this
00:42:06.32 --> 00:42:12.96 camp and it says it was into conquering bears camp that an old foot sore cow wandered on especially
00:42:12.96 --> 00:42:18.40 hot afternoon the Lakota didn't own any cattle of course so it was correctly assumed that she had
00:42:18.40 --> 00:42:23.68 been lost or abandoned by some white man trying to escape the barking dogs she was running between
00:42:23.68 --> 00:42:29.44 lodges knocking over meat racks after the loft or stop someone realized that although old and thin
00:42:29.44 --> 00:42:43.52 she was fresh meat so they you know they kill a cow word of the predicament spread quickly
00:42:43.52 --> 00:42:49.76 through the camps because now someone's mad i think believe it was a Mormon they call it they keep
00:42:49.76 --> 00:42:56.96 calling the Mormon man a Mormon man wanted the cow he's complaining the soldiers that is cow had
00:42:56.96 --> 00:43:05.20 been stolen so word of the predicament quickly spread through the camps the next afternoon the soldiers
00:43:05.20 --> 00:43:11.44 started from the fort in two wagons and with two wagon guns but the man leading them was not
00:43:11.44 --> 00:43:16.40 flemming this is one of the soldiers that they had worked with or knew it was one called
00:43:16.40 --> 00:43:24.32 gratin a new officer lately come from the east with him was a man married to a Lakota woman
00:43:24.32 --> 00:43:31.20 a speaks white brought along to translate gratin it was later learned had been loud about his
00:43:31.20 --> 00:43:40.48 disdain for the Lakota so you got now an arrogant guy that's also afraid and when the soldiers
00:43:40.48 --> 00:43:44.72 reached his camp conquering bear left his lodged to meet them even as they jumped from the wagons
00:43:44.72 --> 00:43:49.44 and formed two lines facing the camp the old man was still trying to stop the trouble but his
00:43:49.44 --> 00:43:54.48 efforts were ignored meanwhile the speaks white road up and down the line of soldiers shouting
00:43:54.48 --> 00:44:02.88 threats in Lakota south of the camp hidden in low shrubbery light hair and lone bear so you got
00:44:02.88 --> 00:44:08.32 young crazy horse and his little buddy watched the old man and strained to hear him but couldn't
00:44:08.32 --> 00:44:15.04 gratin stepped down from his horse and helped load one of the wagon guns aimed into the camp
00:44:15.60 --> 00:44:22.80 the officer shouted the wagon gun blasted and all movement seemed to come to a stop but for a heartbeat
00:44:23.52 --> 00:44:29.28 the tops of a lodged lodges poles splintered into many pieces then the soldiers aimed their
00:44:29.28 --> 00:44:36.80 rifles and fired before the echo from the wagon gun had faded a astonished and unable to immediately
00:44:36.80 --> 00:44:42.80 perceive the reality unfolding before their eyes the two boys watched conquering bear fall back
00:44:42.80 --> 00:44:48.64 struck in the chest and stomach the second wagon gun boomed and then the Lakota men reacted
00:44:49.04 --> 00:44:54.80 before the soldiers could reload their rifles to fire again a few Lakota guns boomed arrows flew
00:44:54.80 --> 00:45:00.24 and then angry men ran toward the scattering soldiers gratin was one of the first to fall
00:45:00.24 --> 00:45:09.44 so like that's how things kind of start to go bad in the world it's like a little
00:45:09.44 --> 00:45:16.56 misunderstanding then you have that anger that fear that arrogance and initially they tried
00:45:16.56 --> 00:45:20.32 at some point prior to this whole thing break and I'm like hey we're going to give you
00:45:20.32 --> 00:45:25.20 sorry about the cow we're going to give you a couple of good horses way better than a cow
00:45:25.20 --> 00:45:32.56 and our estimation in in trade for that and they're like oh no no that's not going to work
00:45:35.76 --> 00:45:40.80 show up and start shooting which obviously does not work nothing work out well for
00:45:40.80 --> 00:45:43.76 grab doesn't work out well for grab does it work out well for anybody no
00:45:48.32 --> 00:45:50.72 there's a there's certain sections in this book
00:45:50.72 --> 00:45:56.40 so there's books there's part of the book he's telling the story of crazy horse and
00:45:56.40 --> 00:46:02.88 he's got sections marshals got sections and here called called reflections and he's got
00:46:02.88 --> 00:46:11.60 this one section where he kind of gives his perspective on what he on on the events that he's
00:46:11.60 --> 00:46:16.80 kind of written about he says and I'm not going to read the whole thing there's a whole bunch of
00:46:16.80 --> 00:46:20.16 incredible points that he may express he says crazy horse came into the world at least for
00:46:20.16 --> 00:46:25.92 generations ahead of mine he was born in the early 1840s perhaps as late as 1845 I was born in
00:46:25.92 --> 00:46:31.84 1945 as Lakota males he and I have much in common enough Lakota culture has survived through
00:46:31.84 --> 00:46:37.68 changes during those four generations fortunately to allow my generation to identify strongly
00:46:37.68 --> 00:46:44.80 with his so he has like things in common he says this by the time light hair was 10 or 11
00:46:44.80 --> 00:46:50.48 euro americans were a consistent presence and an increasing annoyance the Oregon trailer
00:46:50.48 --> 00:46:56.56 had been caught across the southern part of the territory beginning the late 1840s it became a steady
00:46:56.56 --> 00:47:02.08 stream of white emigrants moving east to west from late spring to mid summer tens of thousands of
00:47:02.08 --> 00:47:07.68 people thousands of oxen mules and horses and hundreds of wagons passed through every summer for 20
00:47:07.68 --> 00:47:14.48 years those people carried with them many things new to Lakota some beneficial such as
00:47:14.48 --> 00:47:23.20 iron knives and cooking pots and some destructive such as liquor and disease most of all they brought change
00:47:26.24 --> 00:47:30.32 my grandparents and their generation were not too different from light hairs parents and
00:47:30.32 --> 00:47:36.72 grandparents the elderly the Kota of the 1850s in the face of the white incursion and changes brought
00:47:36.72 --> 00:47:41.76 to them were telling stories and reminding their children and grandchildren to remember the
00:47:41.76 --> 00:47:50.24 trailers they had walked hand crafting a bow out of ash is almost a lost art for the Lakota
00:47:51.12 --> 00:47:57.76 my grandfather taught me because his father white tail feather and second father which is a step
00:47:57.76 --> 00:48:03.20 father Henry two hawk taught him to make bows and arrows they learned it from their fathers and
00:48:03.20 --> 00:48:08.88 grandfather's and the methods and process are the same as those that were taught to light hair
00:48:08.88 --> 00:48:15.76 exactly the same each time i've had the opportunity to make a bow a thought invariably passes through
00:48:15.76 --> 00:48:23.04 my mind this is the way it has been done for hundreds of generations i make my bows the same way
00:48:23.04 --> 00:48:29.68 crazy horse did that is only one of the many connections i have with him as Lakota boys
00:48:31.68 --> 00:48:35.76 there's a great discussion somewhere in this book where they're talking about the elders and they're
00:48:35.76 --> 00:48:44.000 talking specifically about change they're like hey we used to use lances to hunt the buffalo
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.88 before we came up with bows and arrows and we transitioned over that so we've got to be ready
00:48:49.92 --> 00:48:55.36 to change as things as things come along and they give that historical example and that's a
00:48:55.36 --> 00:48:59.52 struggle isn't it when when we think of valued traditions that we have in our culture
00:48:59.52 --> 00:49:05.84 like what what do we strive to hold on to and and what do we let go of as we grow yeah and there's
00:49:05.84 --> 00:49:10.24 i i don't remember if i'm going to cover this or not but i'll bring it up right now one of those
00:49:10.24 --> 00:49:15.36 same just types of discussions they're talking about there's a time when it's time to get on the new horse
00:49:16.48 --> 00:49:21.36 and like the old horse isn't working anymore you gotta get on a new horse and and that's a
00:49:21.36 --> 00:49:25.76 good expression to keep in your mind because you're riding that horse and it's starting to fade or
00:49:25.76 --> 00:49:30.48 it's not able to do it's job anymore yet got again on a new horse even though you're comfortable
00:49:30.48 --> 00:49:35.84 with your old horse even though you that old horse's been good to you it's not going to work out anymore
00:49:35.84 --> 00:49:46.08 you've got to be ready to transition to the new horse getting now back into the the story
00:49:46.80 --> 00:49:50.96 out of the reflections and back into the story light hair had been in the camp but a few days
00:49:50.96 --> 00:49:57.52 when a rating party prepared to go against the pony and omaha who had become too daring of late
00:49:57.52 --> 00:50:04.000 coming north well past the running water he accepted the invitation to go along the raiders in the
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.32 eat the raiders went east toward the loop river an area of rolling hills and tall grass and many
00:50:10.32 --> 00:50:16.48 deer there they separated into two groups one turned south to probe into pony country and the other
00:50:16.48 --> 00:50:22.32 with spotted tail and iron shell leading had spotted an omaha camp in the breaks of the east in
00:50:22.32 --> 00:50:28.88 the breaks east of the loop a small number of the group crept close to the camp while the rest
00:50:28.88 --> 00:50:34.56 hidden weighted light hair was won staying close to his uncle they crawled in among the horse
00:50:34.56 --> 00:50:38.96 heard and slowly cut the hobbles from the horses legs and chased them out of the camp
00:50:39.92 --> 00:50:46.000 though the omaha didn't immediately respond a large contingent soon started out to recover
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.24 their horses spotted tails group waited a little longer than attacked the camp the few omaha
00:50:52.24 --> 00:50:58.40 men left in camp fought hard but so did the Lakota spotted tail charged several times on horse
00:50:58.40 --> 00:51:04.72 back alone and light hair claimed his first victory as a fighting man and omaha tried to attack
00:51:04.72 --> 00:51:11.12 through some tall grass but light hair stopped him with a well placed arrow the confusion and chaos
00:51:11.12 --> 00:51:16.64 delayed his reaction what he had just done though he was vaguely aware of the man's death throws
00:51:17.60 --> 00:51:22.72 seized by a sudden bravado he crawled through the grass to take the scalp of his first kill
00:51:25.04 --> 00:51:30.32 a wave of sickness swept through him the dead omaha was a young woman
00:51:31.36 --> 00:51:38.32 he turned away the fighting was over the raided been successful though the omaha had recovered
00:51:38.32 --> 00:51:44.40 some of their horses spotted tails daring and courage was the talk around the fire light hair
00:51:44.40 --> 00:51:52.32 sat quietly wrestling with the reality of taking a human life like all newcomers to it he had
00:51:52.32 --> 00:51:58.72 learned something about the unfettered violence of combat ordinary perception did not exist
00:51:58.72 --> 00:52:05.84 and senses became confused the omaha who attacked him seemed to move so swiftly two swiftly
00:52:05.84 --> 00:52:11.20 for a developer at reaction on the other hand when he had let go of her head because he didn't
00:52:11.20 --> 00:52:19.28 want her scalp everything around him seemed to move very very slowly her hair was soft thick and very
00:52:19.28 --> 00:52:25.20 long light hair said nothing although he knew the overall outcome of the raided been good
00:52:26.32 --> 00:52:32.64 they had no they had new horses and no one had been hurt but the face of the dead girl stayed in his mind
00:52:32.64 --> 00:52:44.88 it's a humbling experience for him and he they go into it and we'll get to some of these parts
00:52:44.88 --> 00:52:49.68 but you know when they get done with a battle they go back and kind of tell stories and that's the
00:52:49.68 --> 00:52:58.000 norm and he's already a quiet kid and this just solidifies the fact that he's not going to talk
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:08.16 about what he's doing a man from the fort came looking for iron shell with a message from the
00:53:08.16 --> 00:53:14.80 French trader burdo the long knives and it's a the long knives what they call the the soldiers because
00:53:14.80 --> 00:53:21.12 they have long swords they call long knives they call the soldiers long knives the long knives had
00:53:21.12 --> 00:53:26.16 received word that the great father which is basically when they say that they're talking about
00:53:26.16 --> 00:53:33.28 the president or at least some form of the supreme government of America the great father was
00:53:33.28 --> 00:53:38.80 very angry over the killing of gratin and his soldiers more soldiers were being sent and their purpose
00:53:38.80 --> 00:53:45.20 was to punish those who had done the killing it was an ominous message but not won totally unexpected
00:53:45.76 --> 00:53:51.44 had the great father been told that the soldier gratin had to open fire first had the great father
00:53:51.44 --> 00:53:56.88 been told that more than adequate payment had been offered several times for the worst the worthless
00:53:56.88 --> 00:54:03.20 cow of the Mormon white man why should the great father care about such facts someone asked that
00:54:03.20 --> 00:54:09.92 was the problem everyone agreed the whites had one truth and the Lakota another
00:54:09.92 --> 00:54:19.12 yeah having talking about that quite a bit especially on the academy
00:54:21.36 --> 00:54:25.60 I haven't used those terms you know I have one truth and you have another but I was say
00:54:25.60 --> 00:54:31.60 I have one perspective and you have another perspective and if you think that your perspective
00:54:32.48 --> 00:54:38.24 is the right one you're you're not correct I mean it's literally not if you can't say that
00:54:38.24 --> 00:54:42.48 you can't look at something you can't look at a situation you can't look at a plan you can't look at an
00:54:42.48 --> 00:54:49.60 idea you can't look at a scenario and say oh I see everything and I understand it
00:54:50.64 --> 00:54:54.80 the the old saying there's two sides to every story actually there's 48 sides to a story
00:54:54.80 --> 00:55:00.72 yeah right there's all these different sides and when these things break down
00:55:01.60 --> 00:55:06.08 it's because you're not listening to other sides of the story it's not you you're believing your own
00:55:06.08 --> 00:55:11.60 story your own side of the story and you can't let that happen and you have to you have to put
00:55:11.60 --> 00:55:15.68 into your calculus that other people see things differently if you don't put out in your calculus
00:55:15.68 --> 00:55:25.92 you're not going to get the right answer so many of these wars so many wars are just
00:55:27.12 --> 00:55:32.32 misunderstanding start with just a straight-up misunderstanding or a little incident that could be
00:55:32.32 --> 00:55:41.76 de-escalated it just turns into the freaking disaster summer past light hair Guitoller his voice
00:55:41.76 --> 00:55:48.32 deepened and he walked with a sure step when there was dancing he stayed in the shadow satisfied only to watch
00:55:52.48 --> 00:55:57.44 light hair fast forward a little light light hair remounted and put his horse into a gallop
00:55:57.44 --> 00:56:01.36 from another and higher vantage point he could see that smoke was rising from the encampments so
00:56:01.36 --> 00:56:06.72 he's out on like a little personal patrol of his own which is he that's another thing I haven't
00:56:06.72 --> 00:56:12.80 done a good job indicating he likes to be by himself so he goes out and hunts by himself he goes
00:56:12.80 --> 00:56:18.24 out in the woods and just sets by himself he likes he's kind of a loner so he's out on one of
00:56:18.24 --> 00:56:25.28 these sort of solo operations and he says from another and higher vantage point he could see that
00:56:25.28 --> 00:56:32.40 smoke was rising from the encampment a few hurs horses were scattered about watching to the north but
00:56:32.40 --> 00:56:39.04 there was nothing else no children playing no dogs running about leaving his horse hobbled he ran
00:56:39.04 --> 00:56:46.56 toward the camp light was fading a dog bark tentatively and a stench hung in the air among the
00:56:46.56 --> 00:56:54.08 smoking lodges and collapse poles were objects scattered over the ground whatever had happened was over
00:56:54.08 --> 00:57:00.16 and eerie silence hung over the camp nothing was moving the horses he had spotted earlier had
00:57:00.16 --> 00:57:05.44 not moved they were still gazing and tantly at something toward the north light hair entered
00:57:05.44 --> 00:57:12.56 the camp the objects seen from a distance now took distinct shapes they were raw hide meat containers
00:57:12.56 --> 00:57:19.20 willow chairs clothing containers robes and cradle boards scattered indiscriminately as if by a
00:57:19.20 --> 00:57:27.84 sudden angry wind but it hadn't been a wind someone had attacked the encampment the horses had
00:57:27.84 --> 00:57:34.64 been telling him something looking north as they had he walked over to a hobbled mayor she appeared
00:57:34.64 --> 00:57:40.96 on harm so he fashioned a jaw rope untied the hobbles swung onto her back and urged her into a
00:57:40.96 --> 00:57:46.48 lope toward the north where there had been movement earlier if the people in the camp were running
00:57:46.48 --> 00:57:53.28 away they would be moving as fast as possible in a bear patch of ground he saw the grooves
00:57:53.28 --> 00:58:01.92 left by a pair of drag poles pausing to look he saw other signs of drag poles then he saw
00:58:01.92 --> 00:58:08.64 something else even in the fading light the distinctive prints of the metal shoes worn by long
00:58:08.64 --> 00:58:17.84 knife horses unless soldiers had taken a pulling dragging poles something wasn't right throwing
00:58:17.84 --> 00:58:24.08 caution aside light hair galloped in the direction of the signs and at the second or third hill he saw
00:58:24.08 --> 00:58:30.40 them people were walking and leading a few horses pulling loaded drag poles though it was
00:58:30.40 --> 00:58:37.52 difficult to count how many they were but on either side was a column of mounted soldiers they were
00:58:37.52 --> 00:58:45.52 heading northwest most of the men from little funders camp had been away hunting some of them were
00:58:45.52 --> 00:58:52.16 bound to return sooner or later but for the time being light hair was alone he returned for his own
00:58:52.16 --> 00:58:58.000 horse so he could take too long to follow his relatives who are captives of the long knives
00:58:59.84 --> 00:59:05.92 back at the burned out camp he retrieved his gilding and gathered stones from several cooking
00:59:05.92 --> 00:59:11.52 fires and built a marker pointing it to the northwest and he wouldn't know to go in that direction
00:59:11.52 --> 00:59:16.80 especially given the condition of the camp he had only been in the south end of the camp so he
00:59:16.80 --> 00:59:22.96 led his horse through it to the north end the mayor snorted in apprehension and shied away from a
00:59:22.96 --> 00:59:31.68 long dark object on the ground light hair bent to it and felt the leg it was a woman she was dead
00:59:31.68 --> 00:59:38.40 he discerned other shapes in the growing darkness and went to them they were all dead
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.76 he wretched after he bent low over a woman and realized that both her breasts had been cut off
00:59:47.84 --> 00:59:53.28 searching in the growing darkness he found one dead body after another all of them scalloped
00:59:53.28 --> 01:00:01.12 or mutilated in some fashion he wretched again and sat for some time before he pulled a row
01:00:01.12 --> 01:00:10.40 back from the next body a child this time perhaps ten gathering his horses he walked out of the camp
01:00:11.76 --> 01:00:18.000 he had covered everybody he found covering the shame of the insults they had suffered after the pain of death
01:00:20.16 --> 01:00:27.20 with the shock and the grief came another feeling starting like a small cloud growing over the
01:00:27.20 --> 01:00:54.48 horizon anger so that's gonna leave a mark you get to a point where there's a trajectory
01:00:54.48 --> 01:01:00.000 where it's almost impossible to stop the direction that things are going and when stuff happens like that
01:01:02.40 --> 01:01:09.44 what are you gonna do I mean you you you you
01:01:12.32 --> 01:01:16.80 through this book you you have a problem because there's this clash of cultures
01:01:17.68 --> 01:01:23.12 and the Lakota have a culture that that they're involved with raiding they're going up and
01:01:23.12 --> 01:01:29.12 raiding the crow they're they're raiding the uh um the snakes the snakes and the crow are
01:01:29.12 --> 01:01:35.04 raiding them back and it's just what they kind of do and there's an equilibrium there because
01:01:35.04 --> 01:01:42.80 they're not industrial and they can't like mechanize death the way the Europeans are capable
01:01:42.80 --> 01:01:49.36 at at the time yeah and they don't understand it and there's like a he doesn't say this at all
01:01:49.36 --> 01:01:56.96 but you can assemble it there's an ROI like a legit rules of engagement that they're following
01:01:57.52 --> 01:02:03.52 and you don't either there's just things that you don't do and there's times where he mentions in
01:02:03.52 --> 01:02:09.12 the book they're going to they're going on a raid to like to stay sharp yeah like hey we're just
01:02:09.12 --> 01:02:14.96 hey look this is like a training op but it's real and they're gonna go do it and and the other
01:02:14.96 --> 01:02:20.40 the other tribes kind of know that's hey this is part of what we do oh this is oh they're
01:02:20.40 --> 01:02:25.68 gonna run a training op we're gonna have to get some but there's rules of engagement and there's
01:02:25.68 --> 01:02:31.92 there's like um hey we're gonna go in we got some horses from you cool we're not slaughtering
01:02:31.92 --> 01:02:37.44 your people we got we we needed horses so we got some horses from right that's what we're doing
01:02:37.44 --> 01:02:43.36 oh we want we want you know some of the meat that you that you hunted okay cool we didn't get
01:02:43.36 --> 01:02:46.64 enough so we're gonna go take some of yours it's it's like there's rules of engagement that
01:02:46.64 --> 01:02:51.04 they're all operating on they were I think it was fairly common too when you raid like
01:02:51.04 --> 01:02:56.48 they mentioned in here and he leaves out like we attacked the village and there were no men left
01:02:56.48 --> 01:03:00.56 in the village are very few of them well what what did you do exactly and I don't think it was
01:03:00.56 --> 01:03:08.08 uncommon for them to snatch slaves up at a minimum from other villages I think you know the
01:03:08.56 --> 01:03:12.40 empire the summer moon which is another great book the command she were grabbing people from
01:03:12.40 --> 01:03:17.04 everywhere and then they would just assimilate I'm kind of in the tribe but they also did a lot of
01:03:17.04 --> 01:03:26.80 slave trading and other things at the time so there's no one that's completely clean in this whole
01:03:26.80 --> 01:03:36.80 situation and yeah it's just it's it's an interesting study that on all this stuff and how do
01:03:36.80 --> 01:03:43.04 you stop it once once that boulders rolling downhill I like you he comes in and he finds all the
01:03:43.04 --> 01:03:47.20 mutilated women like how do you put that fire out now it's gonna be rough
01:03:54.96 --> 01:04:01.52 there's a guy named harney the gizapp caramel maybe a general general general harney
01:04:01.52 --> 01:04:08.40 early in the morning soldiers had been seen moving up blue water spotted tail and iron
01:04:08.40 --> 01:04:13.60 shell and a few warrior leaders rode out under a white banner to talk of troops to talk
01:04:14.24 --> 01:04:19.52 the leader of the soldiers was a white haired man and bearded older man who said his name was
01:04:19.52 --> 01:04:24.64 general harney and they eventually put two and two together that this is the guy that led this raid
01:04:24.64 --> 01:04:29.44 or did come harney had stopped at Fort Laramie since he was the leader of the soldiers he declared
01:04:29.44 --> 01:04:33.44 an end to trading with the Lakota still demanding the surrender of the killers of grapon
01:04:34.40 --> 01:04:39.20 when the story of the attack on little funders camp on the on the blue water was carried north
01:04:39.20 --> 01:04:45.60 to the other Lakota camps general harney was given a new name to the Lakota he would always be known
01:04:45.60 --> 01:04:52.80 as woman killer so the fact that they're given him that specific name probably is an
01:04:52.80 --> 01:04:57.44 indicator that that's not common practice for them to kill him no that's not saying there's
01:04:57.44 --> 01:05:07.04 our oeze man that there were violate big time one evening he returned from a long outing with
01:05:07.04 --> 01:05:12.64 high backbone and waited for his father in the large large when crazy horse that's the dad
01:05:12.64 --> 01:05:17.76 returned the boy held out a bundle of tobacco it was a gift and offering to a holy man
01:05:17.76 --> 01:05:23.60 when one needed to speak from one's heart light hair needed to tell of a dream a dream that it
01:05:23.60 --> 01:05:29.84 come to him the second night he had spent alone on a sandstone bluff it had been with him every
01:05:29.84 --> 01:05:35.68 day and night for these many months he told his father dreams were important crazy horse said
01:05:36.40 --> 01:05:43.12 as he as he took the offering of tobacco from his oldest son so now we get into this dream
01:05:44.80 --> 01:05:49.84 the dream was not difficult to remember and this dream is like the central theme of this book so
01:05:49.84 --> 01:05:55.68 the dream was not difficult to remember only to tell it had been a part of the boy since the late
01:05:55.68 --> 01:06:02.56 summer night near the sand hill country when old conquering beer bear lay dying in camp after the
01:06:02.56 --> 01:06:08.56 incident with the soldiers with the soldier gratin in his men he was almost embarrassed to describe it
01:06:09.36 --> 01:06:16.32 the dream began at a lake a small still lake bursting upward from the blue calmness
01:06:16.32 --> 01:06:22.96 a horse and its writer broke through the surface and rode out across the land the writer was a man
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:30.24 a slender man who wore his hair loose a stone was tied behind his left ear a reddish brown stone
01:06:30.24 --> 01:06:35.84 a lightning mark was painted across one side of his face on his bare chest were blue hailstones
01:06:36.56 --> 01:06:43.68 behind him behind them to the west as they galloped was a dark rolling cloud rising higher and higher
01:06:43.68 --> 01:06:51.44 from it came the deep rumble of thunder and flashes of lightning the horse was strong and swift
01:06:51.44 --> 01:06:59.52 and changed its colors red yellow black white and blue bullets and arrows suddenly filled the air
01:06:59.52 --> 01:07:06.56 flying at the horse and writer but they all passed without touching them close above them
01:07:06.56 --> 01:07:16.56 through a red tailed hawk sending out its shrill cry people his own kind suddenly rose up all around
01:07:16.56 --> 01:07:27.04 and grabbed the writer pulling him down from behind the dream ended there seemed to be a warning
01:07:27.04 --> 01:07:33.12 in the dream but glorious warrior in the dream was grown but still young the faces of the
01:07:33.12 --> 01:07:38.16 enemies that it sent bullets and arrows at him were not visible but the people who had pulled
01:07:38.16 --> 01:07:45.52 him down were like the writer himself they were easily seen as was the horse the hawk and the
01:07:45.52 --> 01:07:52.48 thunder's the thunder's they were the powerful beings that lived in the west perhaps the most
01:07:52.48 --> 01:07:59.52 powerful of all beings ever anywhere rarely did anyone dream of the thunder's and anyone who did
01:07:59.52 --> 01:08:05.60 had a special calling to be a sacred clown the one who did the opposite of what was expected light
01:08:05.60 --> 01:08:12.48 hered described the lightning mark on the dream writers face as well as blue hailstones painted
01:08:12.48 --> 01:08:18.88 across across his chest lightning and hail were both strongly associated with the thunder's
01:08:20.48 --> 01:08:25.44 crazy horse the door crazy horse closed the door and began singing again
01:08:25.44 --> 01:08:33.92 and another gathering song to call in the spirits he poured water on the stones sending steam
01:08:33.92 --> 01:08:40.48 and new waves of heat rolling inside the tiny enclosure light heren dirt the heat even as he had
01:08:40.48 --> 01:08:47.84 held the dream in his mind's eye as his father had instructed him to do dying gloriously
01:08:47.84 --> 01:08:53.92 making the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the people was the secret dream of every Lakota fighting
01:08:53.92 --> 01:09:02.88 man it was the warrior code repeated in all the honoring songs the dream seemed to suggest that the
01:09:02.88 --> 01:09:09.84 dreamer would gain honor and immortality by living and dying as a warrior but perhaps there was more
01:09:09.84 --> 01:09:15.44 to the dream perhaps there was a warning of a path that could not be avoided
01:09:15.44 --> 01:09:28.000 so there's a lot of foreshadowing in that dream of his life that he's not going to live very
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.72 long and not going to live to old age and the scariest thing I guess is the fact that people his own
01:09:34.72 --> 01:09:39.68 kind are the people that kind of drag him down from behind
01:09:39.68 --> 01:09:50.000 and you know this this got me to thinking you know when I had when I had a mica
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.52 think on the podcast and I started off by reading some stuff that he's either said or written
01:09:58.40 --> 01:10:06.000 and that was that one quote this native American quote and I don't know which tribe it came from
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:16.72 and I didn't research it but the quote is a diagnosis becomes a curse basically when you diagnose
01:10:16.72 --> 01:10:25.12 someone with something it can become a curse a self fulfilling prophecy you know and that's
01:10:25.12 --> 01:10:40.72 something to look out for you know it's something to look out for yeah it's it's um I think it's better
01:10:41.68 --> 01:10:46.48 as we go through the story to discuss it later the struggle that the tribe has between
01:10:47.28 --> 01:10:54.08 the folks that are going to the take the free annuities and the folks that are deciding to live wild
01:10:54.08 --> 01:11:03.36 and then that friction and that friction corrods them from the inside out yeah and man the
01:11:03.36 --> 01:11:12.16 egos that come into play are just very disturbing mentioned he's a few more characters coming
01:11:12.16 --> 01:11:16.16 to play even in the company of heat dog and lone bear light hair laughed and smiled less
01:11:16.16 --> 01:11:20.24 often and didn't participate in their banter as much as he usually did this after he kind of
01:11:20.24 --> 01:11:25.76 reports his dream to his dad his friends knew that crazy horse had taken light hair off somewhere
01:11:25.76 --> 01:11:31.04 for several days and at since returning their light hair friend was less communicative but they
01:11:31.04 --> 01:11:37.12 also knew that he always tried harder to win the games the boys played to emulate warriors
01:11:37.12 --> 01:11:43.76 in fact he rarely lost he was not always the fastest or the quickest or the best shot but he
01:11:43.76 --> 01:11:51.84 simply kept trying and though he didn't tell them what to do they still followed him because
01:11:51.84 --> 01:11:57.36 he didn't hesitate to take the lead he seemed to know instinctively the best trail to follow
01:11:57.36 --> 01:12:05.12 or the best way to do something word of light hair's dream had quietly spread among the fighting
01:12:05.12 --> 01:12:10.000 men sooner later some said the boy would have to put his medicine to the test there was only one
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.52 way to see if the enemies bullets and arrows would not strike him so preparations were made for
01:12:15.52 --> 01:12:21.92 raid north into crowlands crazy horse and little hawk had found a reddish brownstone for light
01:12:21.92 --> 01:12:26.40 hair to wear behind his left ear and taught him how to paint lightning and hail stone marks
01:12:26.40 --> 01:12:33.84 from his dream then a bullet gona stray while someone was practicing grazed light hairs knee
01:12:33.84 --> 01:12:41.92 it's like friendly fire scenario someone's out just training and get and crazed and light hair
01:12:41.92 --> 01:12:48.48 get shot though crazy horse says dad treated the wound carefully to him it was a sign
01:12:48.48 --> 01:12:53.44 a worrisome sign directly related to the people in the dream pulling the rider down
01:12:53.44 --> 01:13:08.72 for the dreamer there would be danger or harm from his own kind we get into the love story part of
01:13:08.72 --> 01:13:16.64 this scenario it's also tragic in many ways news is buzzing about a prominent family planning
01:13:16.64 --> 01:13:21.12 a coming out serenote ceremony for a favorite daughter there would be much feasting and dancing
01:13:21.12 --> 01:13:27.20 red cloud was an impressive figure of a man and had reputation as an orator he was the head of a
01:13:27.20 --> 01:13:33.28 large family and some would say he would be an important man for years to come so it was only natural
01:13:33.28 --> 01:13:37.92 that the people were excited that his niece black buffalo woman was to be honored
01:13:38.80 --> 01:13:43.76 as a tiny doide girl she'd cross light hairs path now and then now she was a beautiful willy
01:13:43.76 --> 01:13:51.12 girl with long glistening black hair light hair hung back as the crowd moved away and managed to
01:13:51.12 --> 01:13:57.44 catch a glimpse of her dress and a finally be to dress her hair in too long braids hanging down
01:13:57.44 --> 01:14:02.24 over her breast signifying she was now a woman that evening light hair stayed in the back of the
01:14:02.24 --> 01:14:06.96 crowd during the dancing black buffalo woman's brothers her father and her uncle stayed close to
01:14:06.96 --> 01:14:12.24 hers or a reminder that any would be suitor could count on having to prove his worth in order
01:14:12.24 --> 01:14:23.04 to become part of that family so he's got a little love interest black buffalo woman
01:14:27.36 --> 01:14:31.52 fast forward a little bit waiting for his first test to battle light hair watch for the signal
01:14:31.52 --> 01:14:37.68 from high backbone a stone's throat was right he had stripped to his breach cloth and and
01:14:37.68 --> 01:14:42.16 moccasins his hair loose in the manner of his dream and the lightning mark and hailstones painted
01:14:42.16 --> 01:14:48.40 on his chest at the back of his head he wore the tail feathers from a red tailed hawk pointing
01:14:48.40 --> 01:14:55.20 down as when the hawk was about to strike his prey behind his left ear was the reddish brown stone
01:14:55.20 --> 01:15:00.48 and his right handy held the bow two arrows against his palm and a thirmed clamped in his teeth
01:15:00.48 --> 01:15:07.12 his quiver bristling with arrows was tied to the front of his waist to be an easy reach
01:15:08.40 --> 01:15:14.88 a shout came from high backbone as he urged his his mount into a gallop to take him up the slope
01:15:14.88 --> 01:15:20.08 light hair and others did the same strangely each rider had only a vago awareness of the others
01:15:20.08 --> 01:15:27.68 though they could hear clearly dozens of hooves clathering on the rocky slope low angry sounded
01:15:27.68 --> 01:15:34.96 humming noises buzzed past their ears the the experience fighting men knew it was the sound of
01:15:34.96 --> 01:15:41.04 passing balls from enemy muzzle loaders the gunshots could be heard less than a heartbeat later
01:15:42.40 --> 01:15:48.40 a man with a gun stepped out from behind a rock light hairs shot was pure instinct and he didn't
01:15:48.40 --> 01:15:53.52 see if the arrow had hit his target his horse pitched forward the enemy who stepped from behind
01:15:53.52 --> 01:15:58.40 the rock had managed to shoot the animal in the chest light hair rolled across the rocky slope
01:15:58.40 --> 01:16:04.16 his horse was dead his bow was gone he quickly sliced the drag rope from his horse and ran down
01:16:04.16 --> 01:16:09.52 the slope first in one direction then another a loose horse came out of nowhere and he managed
01:16:09.52 --> 01:16:18.08 to grab a handful of mane and swing on there was gunfire from below an answering fire from the
01:16:18.08 --> 01:16:24.56 rocks at the top of the hill the horse was rushing up the slope in a blind panic and took his new
01:16:24.56 --> 01:16:33.04 rider among the rocks you got a commentary on grabbing a horse by the man just like that is so cool
01:16:34.24 --> 01:16:39.68 that that and it's not his horse it's just the guy so good he's grabbing any horse it comes by by the
01:16:39.68 --> 01:16:47.52 main just hopping on swing back up back into the fight the pistol he snapped off a shot with his pistol
01:16:47.52 --> 01:16:51.44 he snapped off a shot in a man who doubled over from the impact of the bullet gaining control of
01:16:51.44 --> 01:16:56.72 the horse he raised down the slope stopping to recover his bow his quiver was still tied to his waste
01:16:56.72 --> 01:17:02.24 high back bone joined him his horse winded together they charged up the slope again in and among the
01:17:02.24 --> 01:17:08.08 rocks this time light hair used his bow and put an arrow through an enemy's chest gunshots
01:17:08.08 --> 01:17:13.04 ring out from among the rocks and up from the slope bullets splattered against the boulders or
01:17:13.04 --> 01:17:19.20 shattered on small rocks on the ground unable to load another arrow light hair used his pistol again
01:17:19.20 --> 01:17:24.56 and another of the enemy went down light hair jumped from his horse to grab the hair of the dead
01:17:24.56 --> 01:17:30.24 enemy a quick swipe with his knife separated a patch of scalp as he ran toward a second body
01:17:30.24 --> 01:17:37.68 and grabbed another handful of hair a sharp smashing blow to his leg knocked him over he went down
01:17:37.68 --> 01:17:43.44 and a heap but hurly got to his feet shouts and gunfire continued bouncing off the boulders all
01:17:43.44 --> 01:17:49.52 around light hair went from boulder to boulder as gunfire waned and then he hobbled down the slope
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:57.60 the fight was over every one of the enemies had been killed the Lakota rode among the rocks on the
01:17:57.60 --> 01:18:05.04 hill to make certain and then came down to gather around light hair most of them had seen him in the
01:18:05.04 --> 01:18:11.92 fight the bullets and arrows had not touched him except when he tried to take a second scalp
01:18:12.88 --> 01:18:19.68 his dream was true they decided high backbone took the scalps from him and cleaned the wound in his
01:18:19.68 --> 01:18:25.68 lower leg someone rounded up light hairs new horse and they all rode away from the hill a few
01:18:25.68 --> 01:18:34.72 scalps dangling from lances or belts horses and guns were the prize as well as the emergence
01:18:34.72 --> 01:18:41.92 of a new warrior among them that night around the fire the full impact of the battle settled
01:18:41.92 --> 01:18:51.76 in like an uninvited and unwelcome history men had been killed light hair killed two men
01:18:51.76 --> 01:18:57.20 the second and third human beings he had ever killed the first was the Omaha girl in the country
01:18:57.20 --> 01:19:07.04 far to the east three years past ghosts the old warrior say were the price of fighting man
01:19:07.04 --> 01:19:14.48 paid to follow the path of the warrior somewhere behind the noble and espalze traditions
01:19:14.48 --> 01:19:22.24 somewhere behind the achievements and the glory the ghosts waited and they would always be there
01:19:22.24 --> 01:19:30.000 their dying would forever be a part of the path of the man who took their lives whether the act
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:38.72 was honorable or justified or not their faces and often their dying moments could not be forgotten
01:19:38.72 --> 01:19:45.04 unless the heart of the warrior was made of stone and few could boast of that though many might have
01:19:45.04 --> 01:19:53.44 secretly wished it to be so somewhere people they didn't know wives and daughters mothers and grand
01:19:53.44 --> 01:19:59.44 daughters would mourn they would whale and gash themselves their hearts torn in anguish
01:20:00.96 --> 01:20:07.60 the path of the warrior was indeed strewn with broken hearts like so many stones on a long and
01:20:07.60 --> 01:20:17.12 winding trail the victory dances honored the warrior and the victory story stories reaffirmed
01:20:17.12 --> 01:20:23.52 the tradition of the warrior but very little if anything could chase away the dark men or
01:20:23.52 --> 01:20:31.04 memories that always lurked the ghost would always dull the edge of arrogance and bring a cold
01:20:31.04 --> 01:20:42.32 feeling at the most unexpected moments such was the price of being a warrior
01:20:48.64 --> 01:20:59.04 you know as you read not and you think about he gets dressed up for battle you know
01:20:59.04 --> 01:21:03.44 he's they're doing their war pain and it's part of a ritual that they're going through
01:21:05.04 --> 01:21:11.12 before they go into that and I think the ritual is probably really important to the human psyche
01:21:11.12 --> 01:21:17.44 to help you set aside some of the fear and the other things and maybe it might even help you with
01:21:17.44 --> 01:21:22.72 those ghosts a little bit remember on one of the early podcasts somebody asked if you had a
01:21:22.72 --> 01:21:29.84 ritual before you went out on ops and I think there is one that a lot of people practice and it was
01:21:29.84 --> 01:21:35.84 like I'm going to change out all my batteries I'm going to get all the old battle maps out of my
01:21:35.84 --> 01:21:39.84 gear and I'm going to put the new battle map and new comp plan and I'm going to go check my
01:21:39.84 --> 01:21:45.60 radio and then we have this ritual that develops it's it's like reinforcing that we're all getting
01:21:45.60 --> 01:21:48.80 ready to go out in the battlefield because they're like one of the last things we do before we get
01:21:48.80 --> 01:21:54.08 in the vehicles are getting the helicopters is we get together and we do comp checks we're saying
01:21:54.08 --> 01:21:59.36 to each other hey I want to make sure that you know that I can talk to you and then I know that
01:21:59.36 --> 01:22:06.40 you can talk to me and when you need help I'll hear you and I'll come right and that it's a different
01:22:06.40 --> 01:22:10.88 kind of ritual but it's actually kind of the same where we present ourselves for inspection
01:22:10.88 --> 01:22:16.16 from each other like hey check my gear out and all of us sometimes some platoons run differently
01:22:16.16 --> 01:22:24.000 where they'll have one guy check it out but every platoon has a system where you present yourself
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.56 and you do all these this ritual to get ready to go into combat and then you present yourself to
01:22:28.56 --> 01:22:35.84 your your teammate like hey check me out make sure I'm screwed away and and then I'll check you out
01:22:36.64 --> 01:22:41.60 and then we're in that we're kind of reaffirming all of our bonds and getting ready to go
01:22:41.60 --> 01:22:51.60 into the belly of the beast yeah it's probably worth noting as a leader to make that a little
01:22:51.60 --> 01:22:58.08 bit more ritualistic right so what can you do to make it a little bit more ritualistic and
01:22:58.08 --> 01:23:04.72 I did this my first deployment to Iraq where we would before we'd get in the vehicles it was
01:23:04.72 --> 01:23:08.72 world roll call like we would stand like we'd all stand around the board with the vehicles
01:23:08.72 --> 01:23:14.56 on it and it was you know gardener you know willing air you know just going through
01:23:15.20 --> 01:23:20.56 that roll call that yep we're all here we all know what vehicles were in this is just going out tonight
01:23:20.96 --> 01:23:29.76 and we for some reason in in in Rmadi we didn't do quite that ritualistic roll call
01:23:31.04 --> 01:23:36.56 we had come up with a more decentralized system for yep everyone's good to go you know
01:23:36.56 --> 01:23:41.28 probably just the vehicles you know one you know six up five's up four's up three's up two's up one
01:23:41.28 --> 01:23:46.80 we're good to go we don't need to have everyone stand around but as you're talking through this
01:23:46.80 --> 01:23:55.84 that little nice little ritual was a good thing and it gives you a you know I now've talked
01:23:55.84 --> 01:24:01.36 about this before the fact that in America we don't really have a ritualistic solid ritualistic
01:24:01.36 --> 01:24:08.56 to wait to deal with death there's not a protocol to follow of what you're supposed to do
01:24:08.56 --> 01:24:14.56 and it and it can I think leave a lot of open ends and a lot of loose strings because other
01:24:14.56 --> 01:24:20.56 cultures have hey this day we're going to do this kind of celebration we're going to say this prayer
01:24:20.56 --> 01:24:26.64 we're going to go to this place we're going to do this thing and then it's over it doesn't make
01:24:26.64 --> 01:24:32.16 any sense does it because dying is as natural as being born yeah and why don't we
01:24:33.28 --> 01:24:39.36 like it's just like this weird gap that we have where we haven't set up this away for us to just
01:24:39.36 --> 01:24:45.92 cope with it yeah and and and even you know we have some rituals like in the sealed teams like
01:24:45.92 --> 01:24:49.44 okay we're going to go to the funeral we're going to we're going to put the tried it you know
01:24:49.44 --> 01:24:54.16 we're going to pound our tridents into the casket like those are awesome things but it's almost like
01:24:54.16 --> 01:25:00.16 the ritual we need to have completion where you say hey once you put that tried it in the
01:25:00.16 --> 01:25:10.16 casket and you bury that casket you know now you've you've let that part of of that warrior go
01:25:10.16 --> 01:25:16.80 and now you can move forward whatever the saying should be or whatever the the ritual because
01:25:16.80 --> 01:25:21.20 you don't really know that you know no one said like hey man once you do that it's okay you've
01:25:21.20 --> 01:25:27.68 given you've given that warrior the the most respect you can give me you've given him him
01:25:28.24 --> 01:25:32.96 the most meaningful thing to you which is your trident you've given it to him you're going to
01:25:32.96 --> 01:25:39.20 bury him with your trident you're going to be with him forever and now you go back to doing your
01:25:39.20 --> 01:25:46.24 job I kind of feel that way you know I felt some level of closure when I've done that but
01:25:46.24 --> 01:25:54.24 if it was a little bit more if it was a little bit more codified it might be even more healthy
01:25:54.24 --> 01:26:00.40 for guys so I think the idea of rituals are so helpful in everyday life you know if you've
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:03.84 got some rituals to follow me people have all kinds of little rituals they follow in everyday life
01:26:03.84 --> 01:26:09.44 right and get up I brush my teeth you know I do a certain I put on like I wear the same clothes all
01:26:09.44 --> 01:26:12.64 time to work out you know I mean I have these little rituals and I pretty much wear the same clothes
01:26:12.64 --> 01:26:18.16 every day by the way but you got these rituals like this is what I'm going to do and it makes
01:26:18.72 --> 01:26:29.52 things easier and it allows your mind to sort of follow a of a path that that is already known
01:26:30.24 --> 01:26:34.80 and I think that's really healthy and I think that would help people a lot you know
01:26:34.80 --> 01:26:39.68 it and it's what's what's so cool what's so cool is getting these windows and what's really cool
01:26:39.68 --> 01:26:45.52 about the story of crazy horses it was written by a Lakota and then we get a window into their
01:26:45.52 --> 01:26:51.84 culture it's not that much different than ours we'd grief they're talking about that their
01:26:51.84 --> 01:26:58.56 virtues are generosity and courage I think we see that as a virtue too right they come back
01:26:58.56 --> 01:27:05.12 from more they have PTSD by the way yes and so as they're talking about the things that these are
01:27:05.12 --> 01:27:13.60 holding up as high standards or things that we hold up as high standards as well yeah it's worth
01:27:13.60 --> 01:27:18.88 if you're if you're in a leadership position of the more ritual you can establish without getting
01:27:18.88 --> 01:27:23.68 crazy you know without getting crazy we don't know create rituals for no reason we also want to
01:27:23.68 --> 01:27:31.84 create rituals that become um constructive but putting some rituals in place is a positive thing
01:27:31.84 --> 01:27:41.76 definitely speaking of rituals that night there was a victory dance high backbone and the others
01:27:41.76 --> 01:27:46.000 described the battle and their parts in it for enemy warriors had been killed and by the way they were
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.12 fine I didn't I did a bad job they were fighting against uh same snakes yeah it was snakes that
01:27:51.12 --> 01:27:57.68 they were fighting against snake tribe for enemy warriors had been killed guns and horses had been
01:27:57.68 --> 01:28:03.04 captured everyone waited for the son of crazy horse to tell of his deeds since according to the
01:28:03.04 --> 01:28:08.80 other men he had turned the flow of the battle but the boy hung back reluctant to talk
01:28:10.64 --> 01:28:19.92 waning with humility he goes asleep fast forward a little bit the son was high when he
01:28:19.92 --> 01:28:25.20 finally roused himself the pain in his leg had diminished somewhat and he managed to doze off a little
01:28:25.20 --> 01:28:29.84 he sipped he from the horn cup someone had left by the fire pit and finally dressed he stepped out
01:28:29.84 --> 01:28:34.80 from the lodge and was surprised to see a crowd gathered in the camp circle at the edge of
01:28:35.52 --> 01:28:41.04 it stood his father wearing his best medicine robe decorated with long strands of horse hair
01:28:43.12 --> 01:28:50.64 a trilling arose among the women his mother stood behind his father gentle smiles on their faces
01:28:50.64 --> 01:28:56.40 and unmasked pride as well crazy horse lifted his voice in a warrior's honoring song joined
01:28:56.40 --> 01:29:02.72 by his wives and light hairs sister after the song came more shouts and war hoops and trilling
01:29:03.44 --> 01:29:10.000 crazy horse lifted his hand and walked forward and faced the crowd I give my first son a new name
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.80 this day he said raising his voice I have heard the story of the brave things he did I am proud
01:29:16.80 --> 01:29:23.60 his mothers are proud all of his family and friends are proud of our young man so this day I
01:29:23.60 --> 01:29:30.80 give him a new name I give him the name of his father and his fathers before him from this day
01:29:30.80 --> 01:29:39.84 forward I call him crazy horse from somewhere in the crowd a drum pounded and another honoring song
01:29:39.84 --> 01:29:46.80 was raised and the crowd surged forward high backbone little hawk he dog and lone bear were among the
01:29:46.80 --> 01:29:55.12 many who came forward smiling crazy horse the name flowed like water over the rocks
01:30:00.80 --> 01:30:04.80 there's a little ritual activity that was a whole scene I'm looking to get out staying
01:30:04.80 --> 01:30:13.20 welcome into the club man and this is equally awesome or at least get in close so the father
01:30:13.20 --> 01:30:24.24 passed on the name and took for himself another worm a name of utmost humility in time even that
01:30:24.24 --> 01:30:32.40 name would have meaning for he would be known as worm the father of crazy horse is like epic
01:30:32.40 --> 01:30:38.72 use gay is call me worm that's where we're at that's the humility level happening around here
01:30:39.68 --> 01:30:46.24 hey echo can I ask you about a movie yes of course good fellas yes there's that scene where
01:30:46.96 --> 01:30:53.20 the main character goes to jail and he's just locked up for a little time but he doesn't say anything
01:30:53.20 --> 01:31:00.16 and then when he gets let's let out everybody's yeah yeah when he was a kid that's when he's a kid
01:31:00.16 --> 01:31:10.16 pop your chair yeah yeah good good scene yeah there's something about that this is another thing we
01:31:10.16 --> 01:31:20.000 don't do great in America you're a man now type thing that ceremony that thing you're a woman now
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.84 you can see they did it for for both black buffalo woman and you know like okay this is it
01:31:25.84 --> 01:31:34.40 you're you're responsible now we don't do a great job of that I went through something like that
01:31:34.40 --> 01:31:39.76 in the Catholic Church where I did confirmation and and and so different cultures have got it
01:31:39.76 --> 01:31:44.64 but as it has we've kind of morphed away from that it's something that we've lost so how do we
01:31:45.36 --> 01:31:51.28 how do we replace it and in a way it's got to be something that you earn right it's so much better
01:31:51.28 --> 01:31:56.88 if you're earning for sure for sure it shouldn't just be like okay time and rate you turned
01:31:57.60 --> 01:32:04.96 you turned seven you're a man now yeah isn't graduating high school kind of like that though yeah true
01:32:04.96 --> 01:32:09.68 I mean I guess in certain families right but you graduate high school they give you like a bunch of
01:32:09.68 --> 01:32:14.88 stuff and then your uncle or whoever gives you like advice it's like an actual thing
01:32:14.88 --> 01:32:21.20 I do lose a podcast on advice you got from your uncle when you graduated high school became a man
01:32:21.20 --> 01:32:26.96 bro that might be a whole podcast series I'm just saying you know you well oh you didn't get
01:32:26.96 --> 01:32:31.04 advice from your uncle no sir oh not me I'm just saying you have a lot of extended family or I'm
01:32:31.04 --> 01:32:36.48 grown up oh no no not really and I didn't either but that's like some people doing that's a
01:32:36.48 --> 01:32:40.72 great benefit because then there's all these adults putting good stuff into the kids here so like
01:32:40.72 --> 01:32:46.16 they you read in this book where there's everybody's talking so everything's kind of common knowledge
01:32:46.16 --> 01:32:54.000 and everybody's involved in developing well one of the things uh in Hawaii it's very common to call
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.96 like if you ever respected family friend or friends that come around you call them uncle or
01:32:58.96 --> 01:33:03.52 a handy hundred percent like I didn't even know uncle was my mom and dad's brother sister or
01:33:03.52 --> 01:33:08.96 I'm gonna just like I didn't know that and so like in the do it yeah yeah but it's it feels more
01:33:08.96 --> 01:33:15.44 solidified in Hawaii because like I was like 10 maybe 11 before I realized oh wait like uncle is like
01:33:15.44 --> 01:33:20.40 if you're actually related to them yeah you just call there's people now even that I still call
01:33:20.40 --> 01:33:26.48 uncle Jill uncle whatever like you can't help it but um yeah so I mean it's in a way it's kind of
01:33:26.48 --> 01:33:29.84 this kind of same thing yeah when you go grab when you graduate they're all there and they give you
01:33:29.84 --> 01:33:34.48 you know all the stuff I get I got my lunch I got put and check on that stuff by my wife
01:33:34.48 --> 01:33:41.68 but because when I saw them it was like six and I was treating like a team guy and my wife's like

01:35:56.48 --> 01:36:01.76 definitely your son from straight away because I remember him coming over early on and I had like a
01:36:01.76 --> 01:36:07.68 hatchet laying around and you're like my you can't have that hatchet he had he'd already grabbed
01:36:07.68 --> 01:36:12.32 and he got it from a real quick right before our pop belly picked right to eat him.
01:36:12.32 --> 01:36:18.96 My favorite cameo we saw one of our old neighbors a great friends of the family great great
01:36:18.96 --> 01:36:23.20 people and they were like yeah we were looking through pictures the other day and he had a picture
01:36:23.20 --> 01:36:30.88 of my kid at he had walked over to their house and he's like six and he's got a naked Barbie
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:41.52 hammer and a nail he says can Shane come and play and there and Darren goes yeah he can hold on a second
01:36:41.52 --> 01:36:46.56 and went and took a picture. This is just too awesome he's simply can pour a little Barbie dolls
01:36:46.56 --> 01:36:56.56 about to get crucified twisted times okay going back to the book there there's a they're doing a
01:36:56.56 --> 01:37:01.36 raid once again on the snakes you know to your point Jason this is what they were doing
01:37:01.36 --> 01:37:07.52 yeah it's not like all the all the the Indians were out there comb by odd just you know living in
01:37:07.52 --> 01:37:13.76 peace and harmony they were killing each other and that's what's going on here um they got a raid
01:37:13.76 --> 01:37:19.20 they're on a raid on the snakes it's going sideways crazy horse found good cover boots soon surrounded
01:37:19.20 --> 01:37:23.60 and his horse had been captured incoming fire prevented him from reloading his rifle without a
01:37:23.60 --> 01:37:28.88 horse his odds of survival were greatly reduced his best chance was to move out of harm's way but he
01:37:28.88 --> 01:37:34.64 knew he had that quickly the sound of distant gunfire was growing fainer meaning the herd of new
01:37:34.64 --> 01:37:40.40 Lakota horses and most of the raiders were now well to the north he and a few of the other Lakota's
01:37:40.40 --> 01:37:47.20 in the trees were left on their own with more snakes arriving moving from tree to tree he waited
01:37:47.20 --> 01:37:53.20 for a snake warrior to pass close and jump behind him onto the horse dispatching the man with one
01:37:53.20 --> 01:38:04.48 swing of his stone headed war club do any commentary on that besides us yeah how are you
01:38:04.48 --> 01:38:11.20 jumping onto the horse that's just like athletic prowess as well pulling out his pistol the
01:38:11.20 --> 01:38:16.000 open fire to distract the snake circling outside the trees and shouted for the Lakota to make
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.68 their escape making the break from the trees crazy horse and his companions gained a good head start
01:38:21.68 --> 01:38:26.48 before the snakes could regroup the snakes continued to pursue the herd and at one point managed
01:38:26.48 --> 01:38:32.96 to recover a few of their horses but they had lost several more men and soon disengaged never in
01:38:32.96 --> 01:38:39.44 recent memory had the Ogilawla Lakota taken so many horses in one raid but they had suffered
01:38:39.44 --> 01:38:46.000 losses as well with at least five men killed victory stories abounded and the dances went far
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.04 into the night the Lakota learned that one of the snake casualties was the son of their head man
01:38:51.68 --> 01:38:58.56 the young man had been one of the first to pursue the Lakota once more young crazy horse did not
01:38:58.56 --> 01:39:04.16 participate in the dancing in fact he said nothing even to his father about the new horse he was
01:39:04.16 --> 01:39:10.80 riding or the new muzzle loaded loading rifle he had brought back warm could only guess how is
01:39:10.80 --> 01:39:15.68 son of the choir them until one of crazy horses companions who had been in the trees surrounded
01:39:15.68 --> 01:39:22.24 by the snakes told him what he had witnessed that the young man had unhorsed the snake and
01:39:22.24 --> 01:39:28.32 captured the gun in one daring moment his action had saved them all the man was certain
01:39:32.88 --> 01:39:41.60 this is just a good methodology for life if you talk about how awesome you are you're degrading
01:39:41.60 --> 01:39:53.52 your level of respect as a human so just don't do it it's just better just to not say anything
01:39:53.52 --> 01:40:00.08 awesome is that is this situation because crazy horse just rolls back in with a brand new horse
01:40:00.08 --> 01:40:05.44 a brand new rifle and doesn't even tell us that that he did this thing and he has to hear it second hand
01:40:05.44 --> 01:40:17.28 12 years of one-on-one instruction provided by provided any Lakota male the basic physical skills
01:40:17.28 --> 01:40:22.40 to be a fighting man by the age of 15 or 16 any boy was proficient with all of his weapons
01:40:22.40 --> 01:40:27.68 but unseen factors determined how each would be warrior would handle live combat
01:40:28.56 --> 01:40:34.32 after the first few encounters with enemies on the battlefield young crazy horse had demonstrated
01:40:34.32 --> 01:40:40.56 qualities that he looted many men for an entire lifetime older experienced men while initially
01:40:40.56 --> 01:40:47.12 impressed waited to pass judgment however it was not usual for young men to perform well in their
01:40:47.12 --> 01:40:52.64 first face to face encounters with enemies if for no other reason then that their inexperienced
01:40:52.64 --> 01:40:58.24 made them less cautious then the daunting realities of combat became part of their thinking
01:40:58.24 --> 01:41:03.04 and the same young men who seemed so daring and reckless and their first few outings hesitated
01:41:03.04 --> 01:41:09.28 taking stock before taking action caution was good it turned reckless boys into thinking man and a
01:41:09.28 --> 01:41:15.12 thinking man was overall more valuable on the battlefield than one who placed others in danger
01:41:15.12 --> 01:41:22.48 because he took unnecessary risks so the old man who heard so the old man who heard of the first
01:41:22.48 --> 01:41:28.48 exploits of young crazy horse not at knowingly remembering that such and such had started the same
01:41:28.48 --> 01:41:35.04 way and now he was a man with a family because there was little more to life than glory on the battlefield
01:41:36.88 --> 01:41:43.60 some wisdom from these from these folks they know what's up the reckless
01:41:43.60 --> 01:41:48.80 die young the old men advised and their only legacy is a brief moment of glory but it's over time
01:41:48.80 --> 01:41:54.64 it's forgotten it is the steady and the steadfast that prevail the old one say so while it's
01:41:54.64 --> 01:42:00.56 started the heart and the imagination to hear of the exploits of a new young warrior one whose quiet
01:42:00.56 --> 01:42:05.52 ways and camp contradicted the stories of daring on the battlefield the old men puffed on their
01:42:05.52 --> 01:42:12.40 pipes as they sat around the evening fires and not at knowingly over time young crazy horse
01:42:12.40 --> 01:42:21.12 would give up his reckless ways they said everyone does not quiet everyone
01:42:21.12 --> 01:42:29.92 meanwhile the lines of suitors at the lodge of black buffalo woman were as long as ever
01:42:31.12 --> 01:42:40.40 she's square it away and the town or the village is kind of taking notice at time went by
01:42:40.40 --> 01:42:45.52 even the staunch of skeptics agreed that black buffalo woman and the stalwart young crazy horse
01:42:45.52 --> 01:42:48.72 were a good match and that she would do well to bring such a man into her family
01:42:48.72 --> 01:42:54.96 but there were still many whispers behind the hand that her family had plans that didn't take
01:42:55.92 --> 01:43:01.60 the girl's own feelings into consideration one of the suitors was no water
01:43:02.48 --> 01:43:09.44 who of his own accord was by no was no comparison to crazy horse but no water's older brother
01:43:09.44 --> 01:43:16.40 black twin was a skilled orator and a man of growing influence and he held many opinions
01:43:16.40 --> 01:43:21.92 solidly in line with those of red cloud so no water was suddenly a valuable man
01:43:22.80 --> 01:43:26.64 there was nothing for anyone to do but wait and watch with great interest
01:43:27.92 --> 01:43:32.64 has to what would happen so you got crazy horse he's sort of the
01:43:33.68 --> 01:43:39.84 he's like the warrior in this scenario and then no water who has a little bit of prestige
01:43:39.84 --> 01:43:45.60 some family connections and there's a there's a mystery as to what's going to happen and who's going to end up
01:43:47.68 --> 01:43:49.60 getting black buffalo woman
01:43:52.40 --> 01:43:56.56 going out the field again scouts from one of the camps along the powder river met the returning
01:43:56.56 --> 01:44:02.000 warriors and were quickly sent back to spread the news of success but before he left
01:44:04.16 --> 01:44:09.12 one of the scouts let slip a bit of news from the red cloud camp that was like an arrow into the
01:44:09.12 --> 01:44:15.92 heart of young crazy horse no water the younger brother of black twin had become the husband
01:44:15.92 --> 01:44:23.84 of black buffalo woman out on deployment and he was supposed to go on that deployment and
01:44:23.84 --> 01:44:29.12 suddenly got it two things yeah he got a two thing all about to the camp and then even Mary
01:44:29.12 --> 01:44:34.24 black buffalo woman dirty trick joddy always there a stain in camp yeah
01:44:34.24 --> 01:44:42.48 uh the grain of hope that light hair dared to allow himself hold to hold in his heart
01:44:42.48 --> 01:44:48.40 had grown into distinct possibility when as crazy horse he joined a line of y'all of hopefully
01:44:48.40 --> 01:44:53.20 young men waiting outside the girls lodge that grain of hope had grown even more each time she stood
01:44:53.20 --> 01:44:59.36 with him under his courting robe and seemed reluctant to leave his embrace or perhaps it was only
01:44:59.36 --> 01:45:06.56 as imagination this would not be the first time imagination totally ignored his imagination totally
01:45:06.56 --> 01:45:15.28 ignored the boundaries and limits of reality so he's gets heartbroken half a month later you return
01:45:15.28 --> 01:45:22.000 fast forward a little bit uh crazy horse said nothing of the trail he had traveled for nearly
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.84 a month that for nearly half a month warm new that the broken heart was not completely healed
01:45:27.84 --> 01:45:34.16 the perhaps never would be but he knew as all fathers do that sometimes the best medicine for
01:45:34.16 --> 01:45:39.76 such a wound was life itself some good advice right there yeah because he'd left he'd gone out
01:45:39.76 --> 01:45:47.20 kind of just on his own for a few weeks to get get over the the heartbreak you know's a little bit
01:45:47.20 --> 01:45:52.96 of rating all one is out of two yeah just just just some little operations
01:45:52.96 --> 01:46:01.60 up um more good comments here a wound on the outside can be watched to see that it heals
01:46:01.60 --> 01:46:07.76 well as everyone knew wounds on the on inside could not be seen but for pain in the eyes
01:46:07.76 --> 01:46:13.12 several months had passed since black buffalo woman had taken no waters or husband soon after they
01:46:13.12 --> 01:46:20.08 had moved away for as everyone knew no water was afraid of crazy horse the old women knew
01:46:20.08 --> 01:46:26.48 that best of all but if they're young man as they called crazy horse bore any ill will it could
01:46:26.48 --> 01:46:31.92 not be seen in the way he conducted himself or heard in any words he had spoken so they hoped
01:46:31.92 --> 01:46:38.24 that the wound inflicted by black buffalo woman was healed though some didn't blame her she was
01:46:38.24 --> 01:46:43.84 after all only 16 and how could one so young stand up to the powerful ambitions of her father
01:46:43.84 --> 01:46:54.24 and uncle um rolling into the back and one of the reflections sections here and and again um
01:46:54.72 --> 01:47:02.000 skipping a bunch of stuff um but wanted to talk about this part where he says where Marshall says
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.20 the seeking of a vision is a serious highly ritualized process undertaken respectfully
01:47:07.20 --> 01:47:12.16 prayerfully and under the guidance of a medicine man to seek a vision is to seek guidance for
01:47:12.16 --> 01:47:17.68 one's life or to answer a problem or predicament young light hair was probably afraid that the
01:47:17.68 --> 01:47:24.64 dream he had that night he spent a top of sandstone but but but would not be taken seriously
01:47:25.60 --> 01:47:31.76 because he had not followed all the rules but it came nonetheless the dream that vision has been
01:47:31.76 --> 01:47:36.72 told and retold thousands of times since the fact of the matter is that we cannot be certain of the
01:47:36.72 --> 01:47:41.44 exact description of light hair that light hair later gave to his father further more
01:47:41.44 --> 01:47:46.56 discrradical to understand that much of the discussion and interpretation of the vision has occurred
01:47:46.56 --> 01:47:52.80 and is still occurring since crazy horse death there are those who see the vision as a foretelling
01:47:52.80 --> 01:47:57.52 almost a blow by blow revelation of what lay ahead for light hair it depicts an powerful
01:47:57.52 --> 01:48:01.76 locata warrior rising out of the lake during a thunderstorm on a horse that changes colors
01:48:01.76 --> 01:48:05.76 riding on skewed through a hail of arrows and bullets until he's eventually pulled down by his
01:48:05.76 --> 01:48:13.52 own kind grabbing and holding back his arms the vision might have been as much a consequence of
01:48:13.52 --> 01:48:18.56 wishful thinking as it is a glimpse into the future for every locata boy grew up with dreams of
01:48:18.56 --> 01:48:23.36 being a warrior and winning glory and honor on the battlefield light hair was no different one
01:48:23.36 --> 01:48:29.04 elderly locata story teller was the opinion that light hair and his father chose not to tell
01:48:29.04 --> 01:48:34.96 everything about the vision speculating that a warning was part of it a warning that the boy would
01:48:34.96 --> 01:48:41.12 die as a young man in his prime such a warning could explain crazy horses daring and often
01:48:41.12 --> 01:48:48.16 reckless exploits in combat as a younger fighting man perhaps he believed each time he was about
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:52.96 to perform the last act of his life and wanted to be powerful and meaningful
01:48:54.96 --> 01:49:00.16 now man the guy's got a broken heart at this point and essentially like they're talking about
01:49:00.16 --> 01:49:07.04 these other warriors get a family in that now they got something to lose and crazy horse doesn't
01:49:07.76 --> 01:49:12.48 it's like the classic but I don't want to take that take that away from his courage or bravery
01:49:12.48 --> 01:49:18.08 or anything else either yeah the classic you know team guy on the ragged edge with nothing
01:49:18.08 --> 01:49:29.20 to lose so I have that's like hey ready to go getting back into the story crazy horse decided to see
01:49:29.20 --> 01:49:35.76 for himself how things were at for laryming he found a loafer camp which is these are like
01:49:35.76 --> 01:49:39.92 Indian camps that are right outside and they're friendly with the whites and make deals with the
01:49:39.92 --> 01:49:43.28 whites and they kind of live off the whites they're all loafers he found a loafer camp a short
01:49:43.28 --> 01:49:49.36 way from the fort and stayed with them a few days to hear what they knew a newbies were laid again
01:49:49.36 --> 01:49:54.96 they complained and the long horn cattle were skinnier every year they noticed not without
01:49:54.96 --> 01:50:00.000 some degree of envy that while crazy horse carried a rifle and a pistol and a far-seeing glass
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.16 he was not dressed in white man's clothes as they were he reminded them he was a hunter
01:50:06.96 --> 01:50:12.48 though some of them took this remark as an insult others knew that living off the promises
01:50:12.48 --> 01:50:22.16 of the annuities was not really living but white man named burdo could speak locota very well
01:50:22.16 --> 01:50:27.04 and he was surprised to see someone from the northern camps among the loafers he told crazy horse
01:50:27.04 --> 01:50:33.12 that more soldiers were coming to be posted at laryme he knew this because the whites had a way of
01:50:33.12 --> 01:50:38.32 talking over great distances that much much faster than letters carried by stage coaches
01:50:38.32 --> 01:50:44.000 and the pony riders they had a tapping language which by which they sent messages along a
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.84 wire faster than even the prairie falcon could fly
01:50:55.36 --> 01:51:00.56 now what starts happening is there's there's they start a fine gold look for gold discover gold
01:51:00.56 --> 01:51:11.28 and there's people heading north of elk river to find gold north of the shell river and these are
01:51:12.24 --> 01:51:20.40 super intrusive right and here we go after several days travel north of shell river the
01:51:20.40 --> 01:51:27.44 people in the gold seeking train woke a woke to an unexpected sight they were surrounded by hundreds
01:51:27.44 --> 01:51:36.08 of mounted locota and sci-yella fighting men positioned on the hills and ridges around them
01:51:36.08 --> 01:51:41.68 the trail north and south was blocked the blockators stayed out of rifle range and didn't
01:51:41.68 --> 01:51:46.72 make any aggressive moves simply maintaining their positions as the day wore on a ring of men
01:51:46.72 --> 01:51:52.88 and horses seeming to have risen out of the rocks after nightfall a ring of small fires burned
01:51:52.88 --> 01:51:59.52 morning light revealed the blockators were still in place days and nights passed into five and then
01:51:59.52 --> 01:52:09.60 six so these these these big train wagon train is up looking for gold and the the Indians
01:52:10.16 --> 01:52:17.04 team up they team up and they surround them super strategic what they're doing
01:52:17.04 --> 01:52:22.32 super strategic because they're not they're not but they're not killing all the women and children
01:52:22.32 --> 01:52:29.36 is which is going to commit everybody to something they're just like hey and I'm sure those people
01:52:29.36 --> 01:52:36.64 must have been horrified horrified he says here there are only two ways for the whites to go
01:52:36.64 --> 01:52:41.60 continue north of return south if the soldiers came and tried to take gold seekers north
01:52:41.60 --> 01:52:47.84 but locota and sci-yella what attack it was decided if they turned back south they would be
01:52:47.84 --> 01:52:53.36 allowed to return hopefully with knowledge that powder river country would not be another trail
01:52:53.36 --> 01:53:01.52 for the whites whatever their purpose or destination and then some soldiers come and thankfully
01:53:01.52 --> 01:53:07.36 they turn they turn the train south and this is what I think is an important piece crazy horse
01:53:07.36 --> 01:53:12.000 would always remember the strange episode on the snake steak to trail especially in light of
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.76 what all that was to follow he carried a lesson from it that he would use as a measure every time
01:53:17.76 --> 01:53:22.88 he looked to the trails a fighting man all the warriors on the ridges surrounding the gold
01:53:22.88 --> 01:53:29.04 seekers had invoked a feeling of virtue of simply coming together a feeling of strength that
01:53:29.04 --> 01:53:37.84 comes from pursuing the same purpose several hundred had responded some from the Sahelia and perhaps
01:53:37.84 --> 01:53:44.48 a few blue clouds married into locota families he knew several by name but most were unknown to him
01:53:45.12 --> 01:53:52.08 on those windstrap wind swept ridges for six days however they had shared the kinship of purpose
01:53:52.08 --> 01:54:00.32 so incredibly in person important lesson for him unifying people and working together towards a common goal
01:54:01.76 --> 01:54:07.36 that's an opportunity yeah and and so when people feel like they're part of the group
01:54:10.16 --> 01:54:17.60 they're capable of so much more and so that means that no matter what you do make sure
01:54:17.60 --> 01:54:23.04 that everybody feels included on the team it's that easy I have a simple statement about this
01:54:23.04 --> 01:54:28.32 together we are stronger and if you can keep that in mind it's it actually is like it's covered
01:54:28.32 --> 01:54:33.04 move because with cover move you get to far apart now we can't cover move for each other together
01:54:33.04 --> 01:54:36.64 we are stronger if you keep that in mind whenever things are happening think a together we're
01:54:36.64 --> 01:54:43.68 stronger that's the way you want to go and that's the lesson he learned here fast forward a little
01:54:43.68 --> 01:54:48.32 bit summer past lazily and people talked about making presence to the buffalo scouts and sending
01:54:48.32 --> 01:54:55.60 them out looking so the so the planning for the autumn hunts could be made as the first heavy
01:54:55.60 --> 01:55:04.16 snow's fell troubling news came from far south from the sajilia who lived along the southern fork
01:55:04.16 --> 01:55:10.72 of the shell river soldiers it was always the soldiers 300 people had been killed at a place called
01:55:10.72 --> 01:55:17.44 sand creek most of them sajila and some blue clouds led by black kettle and white antelope
01:55:18.48 --> 01:55:23.92 both leaders were regarded as wise and always working for peace the killing was bad enough because
01:55:23.92 --> 01:55:28.96 those killed were mostly women and children but the soldiers who attacked did more than kill
01:55:30.24 --> 01:55:36.40 the white agent trusted by black kettle and white antelope had advised them to find a place to
01:55:36.40 --> 01:55:42.08 pitch their lodges that was away from the main trails it was told there were many whites in that
01:55:42.08 --> 01:55:48.08 part of the country many living in a large town called Denver and there was a hatred among them
01:55:48.72 --> 01:55:56.88 for the sajila and people of the earth the camp was to fly the white banner of peace as well as
01:55:56.88 --> 01:56:03.68 the striped banner of the long knives to signify they were peaceful but the soldiers found them
01:56:03.68 --> 01:56:10.08 and the banners meant nothing the messengers could barely tell the story trying to keep back the
01:56:10.08 --> 01:56:15.12 anger and the tears as well as the bile that rose in the throat for remembering women and children
01:56:15.12 --> 01:56:20.000 were butchered after they were killed it was told parts of their bodies were cut away such as a
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:26.000 woman's breasts and genitalia's a child's hand or fingers and boys genitalia's
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:35.12 brains were bashed out with gun stocks and eyes were gouged out some babies not yet burned
01:56:35.12 --> 01:56:40.96 born were cut from their mother's stomachs the final insult came when the soldiers attached
01:56:40.96 --> 01:56:46.24 body parts to their blue coats and rode in a victory march through the streets of the large
01:56:46.24 --> 01:56:53.68 town as the other whites cheered the Lakota did not want to believe the news not because they
01:56:53.68 --> 01:57:00.24 wanted to deny the truth of it but because it was much too difficult to believe that anyone could do
01:57:00.24 --> 01:57:05.20 such unspeakable deeds
01:57:08.48 --> 01:57:13.84 sancryk masker um i did a podcast about that with
01:57:15.12 --> 01:57:21.52 denyeli beleli and derral kuper we we talked about the mili masker in the sancryk masker and it's
01:57:21.52 --> 01:57:32.48 just a freaking nightmare all the whites were not worthy enemy now and that thought was
01:57:32.48 --> 01:57:39.28 carried with guns, lances, war clubs and bows as angry men rode out from the great camp
01:57:39.28 --> 01:57:46.40 the Lakota swept to the northeast the sahelia to the northwest and the blue clouds swirled
01:57:46.40 --> 01:57:55.12 like hornets in between, waystations soldier soldier posts and tra- any travelers along the
01:57:55.12 --> 01:58:00.88 holy road or any frequented by whites were the objectives young men took addmonitions of their
01:58:00.88 --> 01:58:09.60 elders too heart as they hardened themselves to mercy and remembered sand creek the spirit of revenge
01:58:09.60 --> 01:58:17.84 rolled with the thunder from hooves of war horses across the frozen prairies crazy horse
01:58:17.84 --> 01:58:23.44 joined the second attack on julesburg but the whites were reluctant to meet them face to face
01:58:23.44 --> 01:58:28.96 in the open so there there was no fighting to speak of they left the post ablaze after taking
01:58:28.96 --> 01:58:32.16 all they could carry from the storehouses
01:58:32.16 --> 01:58:44.88 so they go and they're just out doing these raids and just getting after essentially right now
01:58:44.88 --> 01:58:55.44 we're at total war and yes we are and here's the disturbing thing is those soldiers at
01:58:55.44 --> 01:59:03.76 sand creek they were you know not connected to the soldiers that were in Montana not connected
01:59:03.76 --> 01:59:07.60 the soldiers that he's at the fourth day and no what had happened and or maybe they knew what happened
01:59:07.60 --> 01:59:13.60 but they I'm sure some of them said oh what the hell's going on with that just and so now you had
01:59:13.60 --> 01:59:20.96 you have the whites that are that have been looking at all the Indians as the same I mean
01:59:20.96 --> 01:59:26.08 I guess maybe not because they they are they are have some like the crows they work with the
01:59:26.08 --> 01:59:30.40 crows directly but you're starting to see the two sides divide and it's you're either on this
01:59:30.40 --> 01:59:36.000 side or that side and that's it and we're going to take vengeance on if you're white you're you're
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:44.24 getting attacked yeah and rightly so and that's very defender of the people then that's what
01:59:44.24 --> 01:59:53.68 you you have to do and just turn it to a trishon warfare yeah and it's just it's not it's just escalation
01:59:53.68 --> 02:00:00.40 and it's not going to stop so they're out doing these raids who are going in these battles
02:00:00.40 --> 02:00:08.96 crazy horse continues to distinguish himself here's here so here's something that occurs they
02:00:08.96 --> 02:00:14.24 had not succeeded in wiping out the soldiers because a few impetuous young men couldn't hold
02:00:14.24 --> 02:00:20.96 themselves back for the right moment this was on an ambush and some of the young guys went hard
02:00:20.96 --> 02:00:27.60 early and so it was a problem that had had to be corrected if they were to defeat the whites
02:00:27.60 --> 02:00:31.84 they all agreed and one way to solve the problem was to find strong young men to lead the others
02:00:32.56 --> 02:00:37.12 for that they said perhaps they should renew the tradition of the shirt wearers
02:00:37.12 --> 02:00:43.92 some people scoffed at such talk no shirt wearers had been selected for a generation because the
02:00:43.92 --> 02:00:49.04 purpose behind the tradition had been forgotten a shirt wearer was to be a young man of strong
02:00:49.04 --> 02:00:55.36 action and good ways one to set the example for others instead the tradition had become the father
02:00:55.36 --> 02:01:01.76 choosing his son to wear the shirt next better to let it be some said instead of dishonoring a good
02:01:01.76 --> 02:01:07.36 thing so they they used to have hey if you were a badass you'd get this shirt but then eventually
02:01:07.36 --> 02:01:15.28 became you know oh it's my son I'm gonna get him hook him up little hawk was growing into a daring
02:01:15.28 --> 02:01:20.48 fighter already winning several war honors but the most perplexing and heavy change was symbolized
02:01:20.48 --> 02:01:27.28 in the shirt made from a height of a big horn sheep now rolled in a decorated case and waiting
02:01:27.28 --> 02:01:32.64 his parent in his parents lodge also waiting with the duties and responsibilities that came with it
02:01:32.64 --> 02:01:40.08 the old man leaders had indeed decided to revive the old the old tradition of shirt wearers
02:01:40.08 --> 02:01:46.88 and as expected the shirts were given to young men of important families so they do end up saying
02:01:46.88 --> 02:01:51.60 all right we're gonna make some shirt wearers the choice of young men the choice of young man
02:01:51.60 --> 02:01:58.000 whose enemies are afraid of his horses sword or long knife horse aka an american horse surprise no one so
02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:04.48 that's a bunch of guys that were you know from from important families but with the name of crazy
02:02:04.48 --> 02:02:11.12 horse was announced it was announced a gasp went through the crowd and the shouts the whoops
02:02:11.12 --> 02:02:16.72 and the trilling that followed with the labyrinth of all he felt truly honored yet was uncertain
02:02:16.72 --> 02:02:23.28 that he was a good choice later two more shirt wearers were chosen and he was pleased that his
02:02:23.28 --> 02:02:31.12 friend he dog was one the other was big road a good strong and honorable man to wear shirts
02:02:32.16 --> 02:02:39.76 you must be men above all others said an old man chosen to speak you must help others before you
02:02:39.76 --> 02:02:46.24 think of yourselves help the widows and those who have little to wear and to eat and have no one
02:02:46.24 --> 02:02:53.84 to help them or speak for them do not look down on others or see those who look down on you
02:02:54.48 --> 02:03:04.24 and do not let anger guide your mind or your heart be generous be wise and show fortitude
02:03:04.24 --> 02:03:12.80 so that the people can follow what you do and then what you say above all have courage and be the
02:03:12.80 --> 02:03:20.40 first to charge the enemy for it is better to lie a warrior naked in death than to be wrapped up well
02:03:20.40 --> 02:03:31.28 with the heart of water inside so that's an expanded version of what you were talking about earlier
02:03:31.28 --> 02:03:38.32 when they talked about the we that this idea of the shortwars and again what do they talk about
02:03:39.36 --> 02:03:46.80 I mean they opened it up with think of others before you think of yourselves that's the that's the
02:03:46.80 --> 02:03:52.88 that's the opener you know as and essentially they're choosing their officers right yeah
02:03:52.88 --> 02:03:58.48 and it's pretty cool because well I guess part of it they're doing it by birth because they're like
02:03:58.48 --> 02:04:04.80 oh you're from an important family kind of like we did it and then they're like you know
02:04:04.80 --> 02:04:09.52 where was a college degree or landowners are gonna be officers everybody else is enlisted and then
02:04:11.84 --> 02:04:20.24 and then by actual prowess merit merit for crazy horse you know and then then you serve
02:04:20.24 --> 02:04:28.000 others before you serve yourself and there's a tradition the Marine Corps has that's freaking awesome
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:36.000 and that's at the officer eats last that is is similar in that leaders eat last
02:04:37.36 --> 02:04:45.76 that's as it should be you know as it should be fast forward a little bit calling the young
02:04:45.76 --> 02:04:49.68 men together high backbone scolded them for causing the ambush to fail this is after they
02:04:49.68 --> 02:04:53.76 obviously just failed on an ambush the young men listened without protests as he reminded them
02:04:53.76 --> 02:05:01.28 that fighting the whites was not a war for glory but a war for survival you reminded them of
02:05:01.28 --> 02:05:05.68 sand creek when he finished there was a loud affirmation but an even louder one came after
02:05:05.68 --> 02:05:10.32 he announced his plan for another ambush most of the fighting men would hide themselves and their
02:05:10.32 --> 02:05:15.92 horses in the ridges and gullies on either side of the wagon trail from prairie dog Greek to
02:05:15.92 --> 02:05:21.20 lodge trail ridge a small group would attack the wood gathers who always went out from the fort by
02:05:21.20 --> 02:05:26.24 wagon in the morning when the soldiers came out to drive the attackers away 10 decoys would show
02:05:26.24 --> 02:05:32.80 themselves and lead them toward lodge trail ridge and then north down us down to a slope ending
02:05:32.80 --> 02:05:38.24 in a meadow before prairie dog creek when the signal was given the hiding warriors were attacked
02:05:38.24 --> 02:05:45.44 and not before or and not before or the ambush would be spoiled the soldiers had to believe that
02:05:45.44 --> 02:05:52.56 only 10 doig decoys were fighting them most important to the plan were the decoys if they failed
02:05:52.56 --> 02:05:58.56 several hundred fighting men would be denied the opportunity for victory therefore the decoys needed
02:05:58.56 --> 02:06:04.56 a strong leader one skilled in warfare with proven judgment in battle the leader of the decoys
02:06:04.56 --> 02:06:10.88 would be crazy horse the cries and shelter affirmation rang through camp and fighting man
02:06:10.88 --> 02:06:16.32 young and old crowded around to put their names in as one of the other nine
02:06:20.24 --> 02:06:25.84 they do some preparation then the attack came well away from the fort but still within sight
02:06:25.84 --> 02:06:30.88 so the Lakota could be sea surrounding the wax could be seen surrounding the wagon so these
02:06:30.88 --> 02:06:37.52 are the decoys going in action after initial charge the attackers kept the wagon men and escort
02:06:37.52 --> 02:06:42.56 riders engaged the gunfire sounded especially sharp in the frigid mountain air soon the western
02:06:42.56 --> 02:06:48.48 gates swung open a column of mounted and walking soldiers appeared the Lakota attackers kept up
02:06:48.48 --> 02:06:53.68 the firing making sure the rescue column was well out of the fort as the soldiers passed their
02:06:53.68 --> 02:07:00.56 thicket crazy horse and his decoys charged so this is like going as perfect to plan as it could go
02:07:01.52 --> 02:07:06.16 fortunately enough of the decoys fortunately enough of the decoys had a few bullets that they could
02:07:06.16 --> 02:07:11.92 fire several shots to make it seem like an all-out attack crazy horse shot a few arrows when he
02:07:11.92 --> 02:07:17.04 was close enough to see the hairy faces of some of the soldiers for some moments the soldiers
02:07:17.04 --> 02:07:25.28 seemed confused then they finally opened fire uneven snow covered the cover over the frozen ground
02:07:25.92 --> 02:07:31.92 and dangerously frigid air with the decoys decore warriors first obstacles and bullets humming
02:07:31.92 --> 02:07:36.96 past them like angry bees reminded them that they had a daunting task ahead and a long way to
02:07:36.96 --> 02:07:41.68 finish it the first few mounted soldiers turned off the trail to pursue them and the rest of the
02:07:41.68 --> 02:07:48.80 column fell and slowly behind them fainting head on charges the decoys would swerve at the last moment
02:07:48.80 --> 02:07:53.68 well within range of the soldier guns they took the soldier north the soldiers north over the
02:07:53.68 --> 02:07:58.80 frozen snow fields at one point some of the decoys including crazy horse had to ride down a
02:07:58.80 --> 02:08:04.80 treacherously steep frozen slope the soldiers took the gentler slope of the south face and kept
02:08:04.80 --> 02:08:10.72 pursuing an open valley with thick stand of trees on either side of the creek lay ahead with no
02:08:10.72 --> 02:08:16.16 serious obstacles to impede the soldier's advance once across the creek the warriors turned straight
02:08:16.16 --> 02:08:22.24 north and came inside of large trail ridge the walking soldiers were slowing down the column
02:08:22.24 --> 02:08:28.000 crazy horse dismounted well within rifle range pulled out a knife and calmly scraped the ice
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.68 from the bottom of his horses hooves when bullets began to ricochet closer and closer he
02:08:33.68 --> 02:08:45.20 remounted and loped away the other decoys to infuriate the soldiers used similar tactics fast forward a
02:08:45.20 --> 02:08:51.12 little bit on the ridge i think i want to say i read that this was about a multi mile like a
02:08:51.12 --> 02:09:00.24 five mile trail they had to make a move five miles they had to get pursued for five miles on the ridge
02:09:01.44 --> 02:09:06.88 the soldiers hesitated perhaps waiting for some to catch up the decoys renewed their efforts
02:09:06.88 --> 02:09:12.56 coaxing their tired horses part way up the slope moving dangerously close one pretended to be
02:09:12.56 --> 02:09:16.72 shot off his horse and immediately bounced up running behind the horse before skillfully
02:09:16.72 --> 02:09:22.96 remounting from the back crazy horse had picked the right men for the task at hand for crazy horse
02:09:22.96 --> 02:09:28.08 and the decoys this was the decisive moment if the waiting ambushers attacked prematurely
02:09:28.08 --> 02:09:34.16 soldiers could still escape the decoys looked left and right as they proceeded north along a very
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:41.12 narrow part of the ridge but could see no movement below the slope of the ridge falling away before
02:09:41.12 --> 02:09:47.68 them was the winding prairie dog creek and the end of their task now the soldiers were pressing
02:09:47.68 --> 02:09:53.52 harder increasing their gunfire obviously certain that the decoys comprised the entire enemy force
02:09:53.52 --> 02:09:59.52 crazy horse formed his men into a skirmish line and those with bullets had sp- with bullets to
02:09:59.52 --> 02:10:06.96 spare fired at the oncoming soldiers drawing into a heavy drawing in heavy return fire
02:10:06.96 --> 02:10:13.20 the decoys raced their horses down the slippery slope forming two lines as they rode they
02:10:13.20 --> 02:10:18.72 crossed the flats to prairie dog creek east line of riders swinging out wide and then crossing
02:10:18.72 --> 02:10:26.64 each other on the opposite side of the creek this was the signal to attack from out of the very
02:10:26.64 --> 02:10:33.44 earth itself came the awaiting ambushers horses and men burst from the gullies cutbacks and what
02:10:33.44 --> 02:10:40.40 little winter shrubbery was there in a heartbeat several hundred fighting men rose road south
02:10:40.40 --> 02:10:46.32 some from the east and some from the west those closest to lodge trail ridge quickly shut the
02:10:46.32 --> 02:10:53.44 soldiers escape route back to the fort the soldiers advanced stopped then they instinctively began to
02:10:53.44 --> 02:11:00.64 fight their to fight to reach the safety of the fort the walking soldiers were shrung out to the back
02:11:00.64 --> 02:11:07.36 closer to lodge trail ridge they were the first to fall as gunfire blasted up the slopes below
02:11:07.36 --> 02:11:12.24 them there was no end of the guns firing the soldiers fought hard as they retreated up the ridge
02:11:13.36 --> 02:11:19.04 but there was nothing to be gained they were cut off with nowhere to go wave after wave of
02:11:19.04 --> 02:11:24.48 the mounted warriors fought their way up the treacherous slopes those with guns used up their bullets
02:11:24.48 --> 02:11:30.16 and then resorted to their bows some had only bows and arrows arrows flew up from the east slope
02:11:30.16 --> 02:11:35.84 and from the west the sky was dark with them and some found their mark in the body of a Lakota
02:11:35.84 --> 02:11:42.48 or Sahila toward the end the warriors waited in among the dead and dying soldiers killing
02:11:42.48 --> 02:11:48.16 them with a pistol shot or a hard skillful swing of a war club or the deadly thrust of a lance
02:11:50.56 --> 02:11:55.04 and then always quiet all the soldiers were dead
02:11:55.04 --> 02:12:04.56 it began with the Sahilia as they remembered sand creek and what had been done to their
02:12:04.56 --> 02:12:10.56 relatives when the frenzy ended the soldiers were stripped naked fingers were chopped off
02:12:10.56 --> 02:12:27.28 belly slashed open eyes gouged out many warriors were wounded but fewer than 15 had been killed
02:12:28.72 --> 02:12:34.88 kind of a kind of a perfect operation really I mean it sounds us like a textbook operation
02:12:34.88 --> 02:12:39.84 and those soldiers got lored out I think they're ended up being 80 of them
02:12:41.36 --> 02:12:44.000 and they were all killed and then mutilated
02:12:47.52 --> 02:12:54.80 fast forward a little bit snow came and winter passed a loafer brought word from the peace
02:12:54.80 --> 02:13:01.76 talkers they had come with more presence kettles blankets knives and now guns and they were
02:13:01.76 --> 02:13:06.72 asking for red cloud to come and sign the papers that all the Lakota could share in these gifts
02:13:06.72 --> 02:13:12.24 so there could be peace in the power powder river counter the peace talkers had come with a new
02:13:12.24 --> 02:13:16.72 offer as well all the country from the great muddy river to the shining mountains would be
02:13:16.72 --> 02:13:23.28 Lakota land so long as the rivers shall flow and the grass grows where the whites
02:13:23.28 --> 02:13:28.16 where did the whites get the power to give the Lakota lands they already controlled crazy horse
02:13:28.16 --> 02:13:37.44 heard many old men ask crazy horse horse road north raid the crow's he returned with new horses
02:13:38.24 --> 02:13:44.16 and to news that his uncle spotted tail had his own lands to live on given him to him by the whites
02:13:45.04 --> 02:13:53.28 agency it was called crazy horse pondered this news even as red cloud road south to fort letter me
02:13:53.28 --> 02:14:00.88 with a new power of his own he made a mark next to his name on the white man's piece of paper
02:14:00.88 --> 02:14:04.56 and that was the fort letter me treaty of 1868
02:14:10.72 --> 02:14:15.84 it's you know if you can get some people compromise and you can make some people and win some
02:14:15.84 --> 02:14:26.000 people over you can divide people yeah right there's there's just done yeah there's a funny discussion
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:34.24 in there where they're like how how is red cloud sign the way our land yeah oh he is well hey
02:14:34.24 --> 02:14:41.76 I'm gonna sign away my brother and laws lodging yeah yeah there it doesn't make sense to them right
02:14:41.76 --> 02:14:48.96 doesn't it's just again it's like hey Jason I'll give you money for your for your air you go well
02:14:48.96 --> 02:14:54.40 okay what about put do you want to buy echoes there too I can sign for echoes there yeah I'll buy that too
02:14:54.96 --> 02:15:00.64 or you know I look at that one's air he got your air you know Jason sold it to me you're like what what just happened
02:15:00.64 --> 02:15:12.16 you know but at the end of the day those guys whatever their motivations were
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.40 they kind of saw the writing on the wall and they got on the winning side and so they were trying to
02:15:18.40 --> 02:15:25.28 carve themselves out even though you know they're maybe they're they're betrayers or they are betraying
02:15:25.28 --> 02:15:35.04 the other locato but um it's that change thing again yeah likes it yeah you sometimes got to
02:15:35.04 --> 02:15:44.96 change that horse you know returning from a hunt crazy horse stopped in the camp of no water to rest
02:15:46.24 --> 02:15:51.20 since the great gathering below elk mountain two years past he had spoken to black buffalo
02:15:51.20 --> 02:15:57.20 woman several times whatever had been between them and long past she was the mother of three now
02:15:57.20 --> 02:16:04.000 and seemed entirely proper for him to ask about her children but each time they talked they lingered
02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:09.52 longer something that did not go unnoticed by someone who knew what had happened before so now
02:16:09.52 --> 02:16:16.16 black black buffalo woman waited discreetly for the gift of elk teeth crazy horse had lately been
02:16:16.16 --> 02:16:22.40 leaving for her with someone but as he was preparing to leave she approached openly and brought him food
02:16:23.36 --> 02:16:28.64 and they stood together talking he left not lingering too long but as he rode away some notice
02:16:28.64 --> 02:16:38.24 that she watched until he was out of sight warm spoke and there's there's some
02:16:40.56 --> 02:16:44.88 some talk about what was going to happen with black buffalo woman there's obviously a
02:16:44.88 --> 02:16:52.80 rekindling of this thing of this relationship of this this uh this love at first sight that they had
02:16:52.80 --> 02:16:59.20 had warm spoke nonetheless because much wrote on the shoulders of his son much that was important
02:16:59.20 --> 02:17:07.84 to the people they will not let her go he said quietly fast forward a little bit one morning
02:17:07.84 --> 02:17:14.32 after victory dances whispers flew through camp black buffalo woman had left her children with
02:17:14.32 --> 02:17:22.000 relatives and rode out beside the light-haired one no two people could agree over this new turn
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.88 some said it was a coming for a long time since her father had made the choice of a husband for
02:17:26.88 --> 02:17:32.08 her when her heart belonged to the shy quiet young man who is now the most powerful warrior among them
02:17:33.20 --> 02:17:38.72 others said there would be trouble though she was a good Lakota woman free to choose her husband
02:17:38.72 --> 02:17:44.72 was not one to let her have that choice besides the reasons her father and uncle had influenced her
02:17:44.72 --> 02:17:49.68 choice of a husband were even more important now some said cautiously and they were right
02:17:51.12 --> 02:17:56.64 the couple and their friends came to a small camp in a narrow little valley and there they rested
02:17:57.28 --> 02:18:03.12 little shield he dogs brother and little big man were among were along and made a feast as night
02:18:03.12 --> 02:18:09.44 fell there came a commotion and a man torn into the lodge where crazy horse and black buffalo
02:18:09.44 --> 02:18:17.28 woman were guests a man worn from a hard trail and driven by anger of a jealous heart
02:18:18.64 --> 02:18:25.68 no water stood above them a pistol in hand as crazy horse leap to his feet
02:18:26.48 --> 02:18:28.000 the pistol boomed
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:40.16 so got a little love triangle going on no water's not happy and maybe I didn't cover it but
02:18:41.04 --> 02:18:47.84 the tradition was if the woman wanted a divorce she could do that he was up to her and and the
02:18:47.84 --> 02:18:52.64 man was supposed to respect it but everyone kind of knew that no water was not the kind of guy
02:18:52.64 --> 02:18:57.84 that was going to let this slide it appears that there's like there's a lot of politics involved
02:18:57.84 --> 02:19:01.92 with this marriage and it was an arranged marriage which is kind of outside the norm too
02:19:04.24 --> 02:19:08.24 yeah incredibly tragic story so
02:19:10.56 --> 02:19:16.40 luckily enough back to the book he awoken in a lodge unfamiliar to him but knew the strong old face that
02:19:16.40 --> 02:19:22.48 appeared as his eye cleared and he could see one I was still swollen along with the left side of his
02:19:22.48 --> 02:19:27.76 face old spotted crow his uncle the brother of long face not a degrading and held him down
02:19:27.76 --> 02:19:32.40 as he tried to sit up she is back with her people the old man said and answered the question
02:19:32.40 --> 02:19:39.92 on his face my cousin bad heart bull made it so no one will harm her he'd been in and out of sleep
02:19:39.92 --> 02:19:44.000 for three days he was told the swelling on his face had gone down a little but he would have a
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.40 scar where the bullet had opened his face from the corner of his nose down to the jaw line
02:19:49.12 --> 02:19:53.44 there will be black powder in the scar from the pistol warm had indicated
02:19:53.44 --> 02:20:01.76 to very fine horses were tied outside his uncle's lodge sent by no water as a gesture of peace
02:20:02.72 --> 02:20:08.16 take them his father advised to soften the anger of those who would take revenge in your name
02:20:09.44 --> 02:20:16.40 so he did and the young men who wanted no water turned over to them set aside their anger
02:20:16.40 --> 02:20:24.96 and put away their bows and guns then one night the young men who had gone into snake
02:20:24.96 --> 02:20:29.04 country with little hawks slipped back into camp sorry I'm fast forward a little bit
02:20:29.84 --> 02:20:38.96 the raiding so before we go there he he humbles himself basically he humbles himself the guy
02:20:38.96 --> 02:20:47.04 comes to kill him shoot him in the face he happens to live and instead of starting a freaking war
02:20:47.76 --> 02:20:54.16 he says all right you know what I accept the horses there's just for some forgiveness and acceptance
02:20:54.16 --> 02:21:04.96 and everybody can move on yep so fast forward a little bit now then one night the young man
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:09.44 who had gone into snake country with little hawks slipped back into camp the raiding against the
02:21:09.44 --> 02:21:16.80 snakes did not go well on the way home little hawk was killed by whites in an unexpected attack
02:21:16.80 --> 02:21:22.80 the news was like a war club to the stomach as his mother's began to weep softly crazy horse
02:21:22.80 --> 02:21:28.40 went out to stand alone in the night his brother had been killed while he had been chasing after
02:21:28.40 --> 02:21:38.32 his own selfish needs so I don't I don't probably failed to make that clear but little hawk
02:21:38.32 --> 02:21:44.80 we've mentioned a few times was his was crazy horses little brother and so while crazy horses
02:21:44.80 --> 02:21:50.88 going through this drama and injury and recovery they go out on the raid and his little brother
02:21:50.88 --> 02:21:56.88 out with I think is out with him out without his older brother for the first time dies
02:22:02.88 --> 02:22:07.28 the next day he saw no water unloading meat at the lodge of a relative
02:22:08.72 --> 02:22:13.28 seeming to sense crazy horses anger no water jump on his horse and galloped out of camp
02:22:13.84 --> 02:22:20.08 perhaps unable to contain his anguish over both the loss of the only woman he wanted and the death of
02:22:20.08 --> 02:22:26.80 his brother crazy horse grabbed the nearest horse and gave chase across broken land he kept up the
02:22:26.80 --> 02:22:31.12 chase until no water plunged his horse into the elk river and escaped on the other side
02:22:32.56 --> 02:22:38.88 not many days after that the council of old old men met influenced by the relatives of red cloud
02:22:38.88 --> 02:22:46.24 and no water crazy horse was to return the shirt they decided his actions over the woman
02:22:46.24 --> 02:22:54.88 endangered the peace of the ogala and no one outside like no one like no outside enemy could
02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.72 and this could not be overlooked though there was anger in his own lodge and from the young men
02:23:02.72 --> 02:23:10.96 at this trickery crazy horse gave back the shirt soon after that the lodge of no water moved
02:23:10.96 --> 02:23:19.20 far south to another camp and whispers were made behind the hand that red cloud was to be given the
02:23:19.20 --> 02:23:31.68 shirt this is like you said there's just a trajectory that that gains get to gaining speed you know you
02:23:31.68 --> 02:23:39.36 lose you know you then I'll use your woman now you lose your brother now you learn to lose your
02:23:40.80 --> 02:23:47.04 placement with the shirt as a shirt where and the friction points are you know him and red cloud
02:23:51.12 --> 02:23:56.000 and so what is he doing he's still fighting and who's he fighting on
02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:02.08 I guess unfortunately he's fighting snakes he's fighting other other Indian tribes
02:24:03.36 --> 02:24:07.44 going to this section here they attack but the snakes were too many the two Lakota groups were
02:24:07.44 --> 02:24:12.32 too far apart to regroup and the mud was too deep their horses tired somehow they managed to hold back
02:24:13.52 --> 02:24:18.96 the determined counter attack crazy horse high backbone and good weasel with their rifles
02:24:18.96 --> 02:24:25.76 were rear guard as others retreated first one fell back then another managing to keep the snakes
02:24:25.76 --> 02:24:30.96 at bay but several snakes on fresh horses suddenly were able to surround high backbone
02:24:32.80 --> 02:24:39.44 and crazy horse saw his old friend take a bullet in the chest still the old warrior pulled
02:24:39.44 --> 02:24:46.56 out as pistol and emptied it at the on rushing enemy until they overran him crazy horse ran
02:24:46.56 --> 02:24:52.24 into rescue him but his horse was too tired from pulling himself out of the mud and the enemy fire
02:24:52.24 --> 02:24:58.32 was too much good weasel finally intervened grabbing the rain to his horse the rain turned into snow as
02:24:58.32 --> 02:25:04.32 they rode road toward home sometime in the night they found a sheltered place and built a warming fire
02:25:04.32 --> 02:25:11.12 with with their horses while their horses rested crazy horse sat huddled beneath his robe
02:25:11.12 --> 02:25:14.16 alone with the thoughts of his old friend and teacher
02:25:14.16 --> 02:25:23.44 so I mean it's just it's just a downward spiral at this point
02:25:26.32 --> 02:25:30.88 they get back to camp crazy horse smoked his pipe and pondered all that had happened since
02:25:30.88 --> 02:25:38.56 he and he dog had carried their lances against the crow much had been taken away it seemed first
02:25:38.56 --> 02:25:45.60 black buffalo woman then his place is a shirt wear now his younger brother and his oldest friend were gone
02:25:47.04 --> 02:25:51.60 he took little comfort in knowing they had died on the path they they had chosen
02:25:52.88 --> 02:25:58.72 there was only emptiness where they had been perhaps these things had come to pass because he had
02:25:58.72 --> 02:26:05.52 not fully honored the calling to be a thunder dreamer though he had learned the importance of honoring
02:26:05.52 --> 02:26:11.52 the old ways from his fathers and from his father and uncles and his mothers he was not one for
02:26:11.52 --> 02:26:18.56 ceremonies or standing in front of the people but if he must live the life of sacrifice he would as
02:26:18.56 --> 02:26:25.36 a thunder dreamer he did not belong to himself he belonged to the people it was not what he wanted
02:26:25.36 --> 02:26:44.72 for his life but it was what life wanted from him as going forward a little bit this sort of
02:26:44.72 --> 02:26:51.92 collaboration with the whites continues and it continues to escalate and finally at some point
02:26:51.92 --> 02:26:57.28 crazy horse returned home to resurgent rumors that minors were going into the black hills in
02:26:57.28 --> 02:27:04.000 violation of the rules set down in the horse creek treaty gold was the reason I yes gold the white
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:09.68 man's god the whites were willing to risk their own lives to get gold gold was the reason for
02:27:09.68 --> 02:27:14.88 their interest in the black hills the heart of everything that was to the Lakota
02:27:14.88 --> 02:27:26.000 so they got the sacred the sacred black hills and the whites want to get gold this is
02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.04 this is going breaking away from the story for a second and going into one of the reflections
02:27:33.04 --> 02:27:44.32 sections from from marshal in this point most boys therefore basically learn the same lessons
02:27:44.32 --> 02:27:49.36 and we're given the same opportunities to perform as fighting men so how does a crazy horse emerge
02:27:49.36 --> 02:27:56.16 from a broad cultural blueprint and set himself apart perhaps he is testimony to the premise
02:27:56.16 --> 02:28:02.56 that some things cannot be taught perhaps there is something innate that some have and others don't
02:28:02.56 --> 02:28:08.16 men and women who coach young athletes point out that while skill and methodology can be taught to
02:28:08.16 --> 02:28:13.44 any athlete the physical attributes of speed and quickness are frequently the difference between a
02:28:13.44 --> 02:28:19.20 good athlete and an outstanding one many people dream of becoming leaders while others
02:28:19.20 --> 02:28:23.92 shun the opportunity even when it falls into their laps general George Pat and a World War II
02:28:23.92 --> 02:28:30.24 fame certainly sought the responsibilities of leadership and reveled in its rewards and prestige
02:28:30.24 --> 02:28:36.000 when he was successful crazy horse on the other hand was not as quick to grab the opportunity when it
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:42.08 came and literally had no desire to talk about his exploits but both were exceptional leaders
02:28:42.08 --> 02:28:47.28 and their accomplishments could not have been achieved without a certain amount of basic ability
02:28:47.28 --> 02:28:52.96 as well as the experience of winning and losing what is less obvious is that both of them also
02:28:52.96 --> 02:28:59.52 had inherent characteristics only a few of us have those characteristics enabled them to perform
02:28:59.52 --> 02:29:04.16 daring and reckless deeds and make bold decisions and to inspire others to follow them
02:29:05.12 --> 02:29:11.68 what those characteristics are by name or label is often difficult to identify but the consequences
02:29:11.68 --> 02:29:21.84 they enable are not difficult to see. guys had some attributes you know and that question comes
02:29:21.84 --> 02:29:27.76 up a lot for our leaders born or made and I always my answer which I wrote about leadership strategy
02:29:27.76 --> 02:29:33.68 tactics is you're gonna have some strengths and weaknesses all of us are are you gonna be lucky
02:29:33.68 --> 02:29:41.44 enough to have you know the full of the full catalog of great leadership assets chances are
02:29:41.44 --> 02:29:48.72 about zero. could you be a George Patton that you know has your articulate and your smart
02:29:48.72 --> 02:29:52.96 and your calm and you you have control of your most you can read people like all those things
02:29:53.76 --> 02:29:58.72 I guess but it's gonna be very rare we're gonna have strength and weaknesses and
02:29:58.72 --> 02:30:07.20 and occasionally some people are gonna get that level of charisma and an influence over other people
02:30:07.20 --> 02:30:16.64 um that's gonna come from a place maybe not maybe you can't teach that there's parts of
02:30:16.64 --> 02:30:21.36 leadership that you can absolutely teach there's parts of even you know the way you care yourself
02:30:21.36 --> 02:30:30.32 that you can improve but what we what we always teach people is you got to build a team of leaders
02:30:30.32 --> 02:30:35.92 that help you with the your areas of weakness so if there's something you're not maybe not that great
02:30:35.92 --> 02:30:45.60 at find someone on your team that is boy and if you want to find step on to success hey start
02:30:45.60 --> 02:30:52.88 treating everybody with respect and and and like they said with their leaders their their
02:30:52.88 --> 02:30:59.68 their deal is your job is to teach is to take care of the people and then people will do
02:30:59.68 --> 02:31:09.20 almost anything for you um yeah I'm gonna do it. Just one of the lessons that you just you could
02:31:09.20 --> 02:31:17.04 take away from this and and see that like crazy horses doing all these things but he's not really
02:31:17.04 --> 02:31:22.96 bragging about it but everybody sees it and everyone else is talking about it which makes it seem even
02:31:22.96 --> 02:31:28.32 greater yeah and then you know when he comes back from a raid the first thing he does he's like
02:31:28.32 --> 02:31:32.64 I got all these horses let me go give them to the widows and let me divide up all this stuff and
02:31:32.64 --> 02:31:40.16 give it and take care of take care of which is a job. Yeah put others before yourself step one.
02:31:45.28 --> 02:31:49.84 Go back the book black buffalo woman Red Cloud's niece was the love of his life politics
02:31:49.84 --> 02:31:55.44 however influenced her choice for a husband she married no water only because he was of an influential
02:31:55.44 --> 02:32:00.88 family and their union enabled a broader influence in a stronger political base crazy horse was of
02:32:00.88 --> 02:32:06.64 course heartbroken in time the wound would heal but as it's often the case a true love has never
02:32:06.64 --> 02:32:11.68 completely forgotten a few years later when the opportunity arose black buffalo woman followed
02:32:11.68 --> 02:32:17.92 her heart and left her husband the coat of women can make a choice because societal norms allowed it
02:32:17.92 --> 02:32:23.12 but in her case a jealous husband did not and this did to him just kind of debriefing this crazy horse
02:32:23.12 --> 02:32:27.04 to put himself in harm's way many times as a fighting man but he probably never came as close to
02:32:27.04 --> 02:32:31.76 dying as he did when no water showed up with the borrowed pistol and shot him in the face
02:32:31.76 --> 02:32:36.64 it was no water's intention to kill crazy horse and he thought he did the subsequent fewer
02:32:36.64 --> 02:32:42.08 brought several factions on the brink of blood shed on one side someone to defend no water and
02:32:42.08 --> 02:32:47.28 on the other someone to revenge crazy horse to prevent any violence crazy horse gave up the love of
02:32:47.28 --> 02:32:55.44 his life for a second time those who were jealous of him were quick to influence the old men
02:32:55.44 --> 02:33:01.36 leaders to strip them of the position of shirt wearer crazy horse willingly gave up the shirt
02:33:01.36 --> 02:33:06.48 but the status he had achieved circumvented the loss of influence many people though not totally
02:33:06.48 --> 02:33:11.28 overlooking his mistakes till regard him as a strong leader and remain loyal to him it was a
02:33:11.28 --> 02:33:18.000 lesson not lost on him never again did he put his own desires above the needs of the people that
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.72 was yet another example for others to follow true leadership is rarely the consequence of election
02:33:24.72 --> 02:33:31.28 appointment dictatorship or inheritance good leadership overall is much too critical to be left to
02:33:31.28 --> 02:33:38.48 elected politicians monarchs managers administrators supervisors and directors having a
02:33:38.48 --> 02:33:43.36 authority does not make anyone a leader true leadership is exercised when someone performs a
02:33:43.36 --> 02:33:48.16 necessary or critical task and accomplishes an objective thereby setting an example
02:33:49.04 --> 02:33:53.92 most of us will never face the daunting task of leading men and women in the combat
02:33:53.92 --> 02:33:58.80 but we will likely have an opportunity to set an example we may not carry titles such as
02:33:58.80 --> 02:34:04.32 president governor mayor general or even chief but we can be leaders simply by demonstrating
02:34:04.32 --> 02:34:12.96 that effort can be made tasks can be accomplished
02:34:16.24 --> 02:34:23.68 yeah you know it's interesting you look at a seal puttor and there's gonna be between one and five
02:34:23.68 --> 02:34:28.72 leaders in there hopefully there might be zero but that's chances are very small of that
02:34:29.36 --> 02:34:34.24 there's gonna be one to five and they might be anyone of the puttor and you can just see
02:34:34.24 --> 02:34:39.28 and if they're well balanced you know like there's some young guy or you know one cruise wonder
02:34:39.28 --> 02:34:45.76 that's just has good natural leadership ability smart has he going check and he can make things
02:34:45.76 --> 02:34:50.08 happen and it doesn't matter that he's not the chief it doesn't matter he's not the lieutenant
02:34:50.72 --> 02:34:54.48 and as long as the chief and lieutenant humble enough guy hey he's a good leader hey you want to run
02:34:54.48 --> 02:34:59.44 this thing it's gonna be fine occasionally those guys get mad they get scared they get intimidated
02:34:59.44 --> 02:35:07.28 they don't want someone running things they think they should be and yeah I've seen it where
02:35:08.24 --> 02:35:15.84 you get like a new guy in a puttor and any isn't necessarily calling any shots but because his
02:35:15.84 --> 02:35:20.96 demeanor he's like got a good demeanor he's never bummed out it's like yeah everything's really
02:35:20.96 --> 02:35:27.04 terrible and it's like yeah this whatever and you'll watch that like his his influence because
02:35:27.04 --> 02:35:30.40 he's got a good attitude even in a worse situation will bleed over to the rest of the puttor
02:35:30.40 --> 02:35:37.52 and so guys are kicking rocks and saying this where you this is done that that that that that
02:35:37.52 --> 02:35:44.32 great attitude is is contagious so that leadership kind of by example even when they're not really
02:35:44.32 --> 02:35:48.96 influenced people what to do they're influencing the overall effectiveness of the unit by
02:35:48.96 --> 02:35:58.08 bringing it's morale of the race the morale that's freaking priceless priceless the hits just keep on
02:35:58.08 --> 02:36:06.48 coming um crazy horse who who at now as a different wife he he he he has a daughter with she dies
02:36:09.52 --> 02:36:14.80 death was not new to him men died and battle sometimes and he was not surprised by that they were gone
02:36:14.80 --> 02:36:20.24 or at that or the way that they had died as fighting men but the bundle atop is scaffold was
02:36:20.24 --> 02:36:27.04 harder reality it was a reality that challenged the goodness in life he fell across it and wept
02:36:27.04 --> 02:36:32.80 uncontrollably days passed there was thunder some wind and a little rain when he could no longer stay
02:36:32.80 --> 02:36:40.16 awake he slept beneath the scaffold curled up on her robe he ignored hunger and thirst warm
02:36:40.16 --> 02:36:46.16 had told him a kind of coughing sickness unknown before the whites came had taken her though he had
02:36:46.16 --> 02:36:52.32 tried he could find no medicine to help her finally when no more tears would come crazy horse took his
02:36:52.32 --> 02:37:00.64 leave the news that awaited him fanned his anger even more soldiers had gone into the black hills
02:37:00.64 --> 02:37:07.20 a large contingent according to the sketchy reports from the few from a few Lakota who had
02:37:07.20 --> 02:37:11.44 the misfortune of being in the wrong place the wrong time a group friendly to the whites
02:37:11.44 --> 02:37:17.12 had been watching the column of wagons and the soldiers when they when they were attacked one
02:37:17.12 --> 02:37:23.92 Lakota was killed another wounded they somehow managed to escape to tell their story so now you're
02:37:23.92 --> 02:37:30.000 you know you're blaming the death of your daughter on the whites as well and now they're going into
02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:43.04 your holy land yeah so now they go out and start just basically killing whites where they can
02:37:43.04 --> 02:37:48.16 find them the most vulnerable at this time is the minors people that are out in these little mining
02:37:48.16 --> 02:37:54.88 camps and so they start initiating more of a more of a guerrilla warfare and this is something that
02:37:54.88 --> 02:38:01.60 you know knowing what we know now about insurgency's that would have been the call because they
02:38:01.60 --> 02:38:08.32 couldn't get people to unite but that fighting like an insurgent war would have been the well
02:38:08.32 --> 02:38:12.80 would have been another possibility and that's what he kind of end up doing here he says the
02:38:12.80 --> 02:38:17.92 tactics crazy horse and his companions were simple yet effective after observing isolated minors
02:38:17.92 --> 02:38:22.64 camps to determine their numbers and weapons they position themselves and swept in if the terrain
02:38:22.64 --> 02:38:27.92 was rough was rough and offered good cover they sneaked in close on foot before they attacked
02:38:27.92 --> 02:38:33.92 in open areas with little cover they charged in on horses that's kind of crazy because that's exactly
02:38:33.92 --> 02:38:39.20 what we would do like if we had if we could sneak into a target on foot we do that if we couldn't
02:38:39.20 --> 02:38:44.08 we just tried the vehicles right up to the target and that's what the exact same thing they would do
02:38:44.08 --> 02:38:49.92 massive explosive breach lots of nowhere common in in either situation they use their
02:38:49.92 --> 02:38:55.20 lances and war clubs and the silent bow quite effectively rarely did any minor react quickly enough
02:38:55.20 --> 02:39:00.000 to fire a gun which worked in the Lakota's favor without gunshots to warn anyone else in the
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.76 area the minors in the next valley or watershed remained oblivious and thus vulnerable to attack
02:39:08.40 --> 02:39:13.68 he says this it was necessary to attack the minors and kill them they were trespassers and thieves
02:39:13.68 --> 02:39:18.24 not honorable enemies the tactics they used were the only way to fight them especially in the
02:39:18.24 --> 02:39:23.44 black hills strike hard and fast and flicked and inflict as much chaos and as many casualties
02:39:23.44 --> 02:39:29.04 as possible and then withdraw swiftly that kind of fighting could play to the Lakota's strengths
02:39:29.04 --> 02:39:34.72 and skills as fighters good at close combat crazy horse spoke these thoughts to his companions
02:39:34.72 --> 02:39:40.88 as they rode home and they listened and agreed they'd seen firsthand what could be done if enough
02:39:40.88 --> 02:39:46.64 Lakota fighting men could be persuaded to fight in the same way and if enough bullets and powder
02:39:46.64 --> 02:39:55.52 could be obtained the whites could be driven away yeah I mean that's the only strategy they got
02:39:55.52 --> 02:39:59.44 because they the minors have got all these things they need they got guns and they got bullets
02:39:59.44 --> 02:40:06.16 they're not getting those from anybody else and so they just sneak in pick them up sneak in pick them
02:40:07.20 --> 02:40:11.20 meanwhile red cloud it was learned who's making the trip to persuade the powers and
02:40:11.20 --> 02:40:17.12 Washington to remove the little agent from his agency when all is said and done it didn't matter
02:40:17.12 --> 02:40:21.44 who the agent was on spotted tail agency or on the red cloud agency as long as there was an
02:40:21.44 --> 02:40:27.76 agent and the Lakota accepted it and newbies the whites were in control but when red cloud and the
02:40:27.76 --> 02:40:34.000 others returned and there were many supposed headmen who made the trip the news they brought back
02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:38.72 in sensed the wild Lakota and you made this distinction I haven't pulled it out yet but there's
02:40:38.72 --> 02:40:43.84 basically the the ones that are living in the agencies and then there's the Lakota that are wild
02:40:43.84 --> 02:40:48.24 that are still living in the traditional way to the best of their ability and I say the best
02:40:48.24 --> 02:40:56.40 of the ability because they relied heavily on buffalo and the buffalo were being wiped out and so
02:40:57.52 --> 02:41:05.28 this makes living in their traditional way much more difficult in some cases probably impossible
02:41:05.28 --> 02:41:14.96 the great father wanted to buy the black hills sell the heart of everything that is sell the
02:41:14.96 --> 02:41:22.72 dust of the ancestors not looking not there's there's Lakota that we're just we're not doing it
02:41:26.72 --> 02:41:31.76 the day now there's more politics takes place and eventually they're supposed to all come and
02:41:31.76 --> 02:41:37.60 report the day when all Lakota had to report to the agencies it coming gone the northern camps were nervous
02:41:37.60 --> 02:41:42.64 watching the horizons for the first sign of soldiers that they had heard had been gathering at
02:41:42.64 --> 02:41:47.52 Fort Fetterman when it relaxed its grip and a span of warm days it melted the snow and
02:41:47.52 --> 02:41:52.72 followed the ice on the creeks and rivers he dog took advantage of the opportunity to head for the agency
02:41:53.28 --> 02:41:57.76 his contingent of eight Lakota families were mostly women and children in no condition
02:41:57.76 --> 02:42:03.52 outrun mounted soldiers before he left crazy horse had ridden up into the hills unable to watch
02:42:03.52 --> 02:42:09.84 his closest friend give into the agency though he understood all too painfully he dogs reasons
02:42:10.88 --> 02:42:16.32 the spaces vacated by eight lodges were not as big as the holes left in the hearts of the
02:42:16.32 --> 02:42:22.48 relatives who watched their loved ones riding away slowly and uncertainly looking back frequently
02:42:22.48 --> 02:42:32.88 I mean you know the guys got a bunch of women and kids and the he knows he's gonna do so much and
02:42:36.08 --> 02:42:41.20 sitting bull sent out his carefully chosen messages to announce that the people should gather near
02:42:41.20 --> 02:42:46.64 chalk butts in late spring and treating them to speak wisely and clearly to the leaders among
02:42:46.64 --> 02:42:52.40 the Lakota as well as the Dakota and Nakota he wanted his messages to appeal to their sense of
02:42:52.40 --> 02:42:57.52 pride especially to those who are surely disenchanted with life on the agencies so sitting bulls
02:42:57.52 --> 02:43:05.76 another wild one of the Indians and he's very I mean obviously we've all heard of sitting bull
02:43:05.76 --> 02:43:09.84 and so he has incredible amount of influence and he's starting to try and gather people up and
02:43:09.84 --> 02:43:18.72 unite them a little bit so that starts to take place more and more people arrived almost every
02:43:18.72 --> 02:43:23.60 day the horse herb was growing and eating down the sparse grass around the butts some of the men
02:43:23.60 --> 02:43:28.64 said perhaps there was many as 7,000 head sitting bulls already at work inviting the older leaders
02:43:28.64 --> 02:43:34.08 to his lodge he was an impressive and charismatic man a slight limp from a gunshot wound to his
02:43:34.08 --> 02:43:39.68 hip during his days a young fighting man served only to give him more credibility he had earned nearly
02:43:39.68 --> 02:43:47.68 70 battle honors more than any man at the gathering except crazy horse now past the age of 50 he had
02:43:47.68 --> 02:43:53.52 a solid reputation as a wise leader and counselor enhanced by his status as a medicine man he was
02:43:53.52 --> 02:43:59.20 immensely pleased at the response to his message and announced he would conduct a Sundance
02:43:59.92 --> 02:44:06.000 spiritually as well as psychologically it was the right thing at the right time it could only
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.20 serve to unify the people and add to the feelings of strength and pride that seemed to be growing
02:44:11.20 --> 02:44:15.68 as quickly as the horse herd it was that kind of insight that made him an influential leader
02:44:15.68 --> 02:44:22.64 the camp movement moved west across the powder and the tongue into the valley of the rose bud
02:44:23.76 --> 02:44:28.96 and across it as well turning at the northern slopes of the wolf mountains into the broken
02:44:28.96 --> 02:44:37.52 country near the greasy grass river while sitting bull was hard at work for the hearts and minds
02:44:37.52 --> 02:44:44.56 the people crazy horse scouts and all directions feeling among the military leaders was that the
02:44:44.56 --> 02:44:58.24 biggest threat laid to lay to the south from three stars army and this book does not have a
02:44:58.24 --> 02:45:03.68 ton of detail about the battle at rose bud or really the battle at little big horn
02:45:05.52 --> 02:45:10.32 those are detailed pretty well in the book I fought with custard and also in the book wooden leg
02:45:10.32 --> 02:45:17.12 um but there is sort of a debriefing here on some of the things that went that went down
02:45:17.84 --> 02:45:22.64 going to the book the rose bug bud fight as the battle came to be known was the toughest combat
02:45:22.64 --> 02:45:28.08 crazy horse had seen the battle of hundred and hand ten years earlier that was when they
02:45:28.64 --> 02:45:35.52 surrounded those soldiers and killed the bird the battle of the hundred in the hand ten years earlier
02:45:35.52 --> 02:45:39.68 had had its own set of circumstances that made it tough but at the rose bud
02:45:39.68 --> 02:45:46.32 Lakota the Lakota faced a larger and more heavily armed enemy force three stars soldiers were both
02:45:46.32 --> 02:45:53.20 infantry and cavalry forcing Lakota to adjust to different tactics as the fighting progressed attack
02:45:53.60 --> 02:45:59.52 was met with counter attack as the day war on the valley of the rose bud funded with gunfire and dust
02:45:59.52 --> 02:46:03.92 hung in the air laid in the afternoon who is evident that the soldiers were disorganized fighting
02:46:03.92 --> 02:46:10.32 and scattered units their effectiveness significantly reduced crazy horse was notified even though
02:46:10.32 --> 02:46:17.60 nearly a hundred had arrived at mid-morning the Lakota and sahila were critically low on ammunition
02:46:18.32 --> 02:46:23.76 sensing that three stars wouldn't be able to mount any pursuit crazy horse sent the word to withdraw
02:46:24.40 --> 02:46:31.20 crazy horse rode with he dog big road and good weasel among others as they once again
02:46:31.20 --> 02:46:37.52 chased dusk into night there was no pursuit from the soldiers to speak of the feverish after
02:46:37.52 --> 02:46:42.56 math of combat slowly faded as the reality of the day began to take hold ten good men in
02:46:42.56 --> 02:46:48.64 been killed and many wounded in a day or two the the scouts crazy horse had left behind would report
02:46:48.64 --> 02:46:56.24 on the soldiers so that's the first big battle that they engage is that battle at rose bud
02:46:56.24 --> 02:47:01.84 and then six days had passed since the rose bud fight victory dance is still went
02:47:01.84 --> 02:47:06.24 far into the night and the fighting men were asked to tell the stories of their involvement
02:47:06.24 --> 02:47:11.12 the mood of the encampment had changed from initial uncertainty to one of comfortable
02:47:11.12 --> 02:47:17.52 sense of strength hardly anyone no matter how old could remember the Lakota ever see gathering
02:47:17.52 --> 02:47:24.48 in such numbers for any purpose at midday sitting bull sent cryers to announce the move
02:47:24.48 --> 02:47:31.52 to the greasy grass valley and by mid afternoon the first lodges were taken down and the
02:47:31.52 --> 02:47:37.12 families began moving by sundown most of the encampment was gone except for a few lodges
02:47:37.12 --> 02:47:48.64 and the sun dance arbor fast forward up a little bit more there in their kind of camp now
02:47:49.44 --> 02:47:53.28 and we'll go to the book the sides of the council lodging and rolled up to allow cross
02:47:53.28 --> 02:47:58.40 ventilation a few men were waiting in anticipation meeting with sitting bull women had already
02:47:58.40 --> 02:48:03.52 brought food sitting bull had been busy through most of the night attending to a gravely ill woman
02:48:03.52 --> 02:48:09.12 he arrived at the council lodged just as a slight den of commotion came from the south end of the
02:48:09.12 --> 02:48:15.52 encampment where he had just been a lone Lakota rider splashed across the greasy grass
02:48:16.24 --> 02:48:22.40 filled bank to bank with the heavy spring runoff from the mountain snows gaining the west bank
02:48:22.40 --> 02:48:27.84 he began to shout prepare yourselves the soldiers are coming the soldiers are coming
02:48:31.84 --> 02:48:34.88 and this is when we get into the little big horn battle
02:48:37.44 --> 02:48:42.64 the soldiers across the river far to the south near the mouth vash creek can try to gallop
02:48:43.28 --> 02:48:48.48 tried galloping their horses across the long open flood plain toward the south end of the encampment
02:48:48.48 --> 02:48:53.04 they had been quickly driven back and then chased across the river many were killed at the water
02:48:53.04 --> 02:48:59.28 crossing after heavy fighting in some trees near the river as far as crazy horse and the other
02:48:59.28 --> 02:49:07.28 leaders were concerned that was the first fight gall of the hunk papa and ol and ogala battle
02:49:07.28 --> 02:49:12.96 leaders black moon and big road were among those who had courageously led 200 fighting men in that action
02:49:12.96 --> 02:49:21.60 the second fight started at medicine tail kooley more soldiers had tried to cross into the
02:49:21.60 --> 02:49:26.88 encampment from the north end but were stopped by a small determined group of boys and old men
02:49:26.88 --> 02:49:32.80 armed mostly with old single shot rifles by then many of the women children old people were
02:49:32.80 --> 02:49:39.04 fleeing to the northwest somehow worded reached crazy horse and gall of the second attempted
02:49:39.04 --> 02:49:44.08 incursion gall immediately disengaged from the first fight and let a hundred men to medicine tail
02:49:44.08 --> 02:49:51.60 and crossed the soldiers galloped away up a long slope to the north crazy horse at hurried to
02:49:51.60 --> 02:49:56.32 to his lodge and found black shawl that's his wife waiting with his second war horse
02:49:56.32 --> 02:50:00.64 the camp was in total confusion not only were women and children running away to safety
02:50:00.64 --> 02:50:05.84 men were galloping through to hurried to the second fight shouts and screams filled the air
02:50:05.84 --> 02:50:12.80 gunshots could be heard to the south and now thinly to the north he took a second war horse
02:50:12.80 --> 02:50:18.48 and gall there is many men as to him as he could if a second group of soldiers was heading
02:50:18.48 --> 02:50:22.96 north they could be circling to attack from another direction it made sense to try and flank
02:50:22.96 --> 02:50:27.76 them so he led the men who were with him to an old crossing guessing the soldiers would stay on
02:50:27.76 --> 02:50:31.92 the high ground he had crossed the river and raised to meet them if they came off the end of the
02:50:31.92 --> 02:50:37.60 high north south ridge where he knew they laid to the east on the slopes across the river they
02:50:37.60 --> 02:50:44.16 circled to the east and encountered 20 or so soldiers whom they chased back to the main body
02:50:44.16 --> 02:50:50.64 the gunfire never stopped he heard it as they crossed the river a continuous sound rather like
02:50:50.64 --> 02:50:57.12 someone tearing canvas gall and his men crazy horse heard later stayed in pursuit of the running
02:50:57.12 --> 02:51:03.44 soldiers even though they did not gain a ridge at first the soldiers were organized even managing
02:51:03.44 --> 02:51:08.96 to dismount and form skirmish lines to fire at the oncoming Lakota but galls relentless pursuit
02:51:08.96 --> 02:51:14.16 broke their lines and after that they were running away and their fire was no longer effective
02:51:15.44 --> 02:51:21.60 crazy horse led a charge when the soldiers tried to push north off their ridge by then gunfire
02:51:21.60 --> 02:51:27.60 was thinning it was sporadic and then there were silence the second fight was over as he rode
02:51:27.60 --> 02:51:34.88 through the dust and he could see how it had unfolded dead horses and dead soldiers were
02:51:34.88 --> 02:51:43.28 strewn along the path they had taken what's what's different about a little big horn battle
02:51:43.28 --> 02:51:49.28 field then then get his bird is because the scale of it's much smaller they actually they have
02:51:49.28 --> 02:51:52.96 markers for where these soldiers were dying and they went back and they could find all the
02:51:52.96 --> 02:51:58.64 scourge lines and everything so you can see it in real you know laid out where bodies fell
02:52:01.12 --> 02:52:05.44 became up from the river then across and then just the disaster that happened I mean you
02:52:05.44 --> 02:52:08.88 couldn't all the the way it's laid out and the bodies are laid out you can see that the guys are
02:52:08.88 --> 02:52:14.88 just try the last couple guys were just trying to get away and getting mold mean while the guys
02:52:14.88 --> 02:52:20.88 down at the other position they're surrounded up on that hill they're waiting for their turn
02:52:20.88 --> 02:52:26.32 they're wondering where cus custer splits forces all these times and there and they're wondering
02:52:26.32 --> 02:52:31.68 where did he go did he leave us and some guys kind of push out and they can see
02:52:32.40 --> 02:52:38.48 this big swirling thing and they can see the Lakota shooting down the ground they're like oh no
02:52:38.48 --> 02:52:49.12 he's done and then they wind up getting their under siege yeah looking forward to walking that
02:52:49.12 --> 02:52:59.68 battlefield myself going back to the story here after that the you know sitting bulls trying to keep
02:52:59.68 --> 02:53:09.36 people there but they they kind of start to like it's the fighting's over and kind of people
02:53:09.36 --> 02:53:12.96 got stuff to do right well there's another element coming toward him too and they're like hey we
02:53:12.96 --> 02:53:20.16 got to move everybody yeah yeah and I'm even going past that so that happens um and eventually
02:53:20.16 --> 02:53:25.12 he says this what was left of the largest gathering ever of Lakota separated in several encampments
02:53:25.12 --> 02:53:29.28 moving along the eastern foothills of the shining mountain soon after the departure from Greece
02:53:29.28 --> 02:53:34.40 he grasped small groups began breaking away to head for the agencies sitting bull like crazy horse
02:53:34.40 --> 02:53:40.000 was deeply disappointed because they were losing the strength of numbers despite the best efforts
02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:44.48 of sitting bull the people scattered some made excuses saying it was time to hunt and make meat for
02:53:44.48 --> 02:53:49.36 the coming winter which was more difficult now because of the scarcity of buffalo others on a
02:53:49.36 --> 02:53:55.12 bashly headed for the agencies sitting bull finally headed north to more familiar territory crazy
02:53:55.12 --> 02:53:59.84 horse took his people east to the black hills finding a sheltered valley northwest of the mountains
02:53:59.84 --> 02:54:13.28 to hide the camps from there he led raids into the black hills there that continues for a while
02:54:14.40 --> 02:54:21.68 and this is all he does a great job in the book of just this kind of torment and anguish that
02:54:21.68 --> 02:54:29.84 that crazy horse is going through as as he sees what's happening at some point dull knife
02:54:29.84 --> 02:54:35.28 another one of his friends informed crazy horse that he was forced to consider living giving in
02:54:35.28 --> 02:54:40.16 to life on the agency if it meant his people would be safe from facing continual conflict with the
02:54:40.16 --> 02:54:47.92 long knives the idea was debated long and frequently strangely an opportunity presented itself
02:54:47.92 --> 02:54:53.52 when messengers arrived bringing word to from three stars who had been given assurance that the
02:54:53.52 --> 02:54:59.28 wild Lakota would be allowed to select the location for their own agencies if they signed a piece
02:54:59.28 --> 02:55:06.24 agreement the only drawback was that included an agreement to sell to the sale of the black hills
02:55:07.28 --> 02:55:12.32 and spite of deep seated suspicions crazy horse agreed that this important issue should be
02:55:12.32 --> 02:55:20.88 discussed face to face with the long knives crazy horse and a law large detachment of warriors
02:55:20.88 --> 02:55:28.16 escorted the delegation north to the fort on the elk river a group of crow scouts met the
02:55:28.16 --> 02:55:34.16 emissaries just outside the walls of the fort making friendly gestures to indicate their peacefulness
02:55:34.16 --> 02:55:40.16 as the eight Lakota road past them toward the gate weapons were drawn suddenly and the crow open
02:55:40.16 --> 02:55:45.76 fire at point blank range on the unarmed Lakota and then fled on horseback crazy horse charged
02:55:45.76 --> 02:55:50.64 down from the bluff but stopped when mounted soldiers emerge emerge from the fort instinctively
02:55:50.64 --> 02:55:55.60 the Lakota emissaries turn their horses and gallop for the safety of the bluffs and protection
02:55:55.60 --> 02:56:01.92 of the escort warriors only three rejoined the warriors five laid dead on the ground near the gates in
02:56:01.92 --> 02:56:14.56 the fort so the chance for peace in the crow just gets gets like completely fumble fumble and um
02:56:16.88 --> 02:56:23.92 yeah you know the crow had motivations to do with the dead and you know the
02:56:25.52 --> 02:56:29.52 I think the guy's come out of the thing they're trying to hunt him down because they realize
02:56:29.52 --> 02:56:41.20 oh dang it yep this is um the fast forward a little bit more the harsh winner should have been
02:56:41.20 --> 02:56:46.72 to turn at least providing a brief respite from worrying about the long knives but that was not
02:56:46.72 --> 02:56:53.52 to be to agency Lakota carrying a bold message from bear coat found the crazy horse camp
02:56:53.52 --> 02:56:58.24 if the wild Lakota moved into the agencies they would be given food but would have to give up
02:56:58.24 --> 02:57:08.48 their weapons and horses sword graciously has ever assured crazy horses people that it was his
02:57:08.48 --> 02:57:13.28 idea to intervene because he didn't want his friends and relatives dying when peace in a good
02:57:13.28 --> 02:57:21.12 life could be had so easily if crazy horse would come in meaning surrender his people would be given
02:57:21.12 --> 02:57:26.000 food clothing and blankets and then he would be allowed to return to powder river area to claim
02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:32.88 it as his agency so like oh you want we'll give you peace we'll give you food you can have your own
02:57:32.88 --> 02:57:41.36 area only he and sitting bowl were stubborn or perhaps foolish how could anyone continue
02:57:41.36 --> 02:57:46.40 resisting when even a brief battle used up the bullets that took several days of scrounging
02:57:47.44 --> 02:57:52.16 half the people who followed him wanted to go into the agency they were tired of running from the
02:57:52.16 --> 02:57:58.32 soldiers tired of being hungry tired of seeing relatives die they stayed because they believed he
02:57:58.32 --> 02:58:04.000 had an answer of some kind something that would solve the problem of the soldiers
02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:25.12 yeah you can it's just closing in and there's really not much of an option yeah these essentially
02:58:25.12 --> 02:58:35.60 your glaciers glacier yeah forces just just towards him and he's gonna get crushed and squeeze in one direction
02:58:35.60 --> 02:58:48.40 so they end up going to camp Robinson fast forward a little bit here nearly four months at
02:58:48.40 --> 02:58:55.28 past since crazy horse people had arrived at camp Robinson 900 and all with over 1500 horses the soldiers
02:58:55.28 --> 02:59:01.36 had taken their horses first and then their guns and then their hope and four months the promise
02:59:01.36 --> 02:59:06.88 of an agency of their own in the north that turned into an impossible dream he blamed himself
02:59:06.88 --> 02:59:14.24 partly because he could do nothing perhaps if he had learned to be an agency Lakota and put on
02:59:14.24 --> 02:59:20.16 the defeated smile and the presence of three stars and other soldier leaders none of this would
02:59:20.16 --> 02:59:26.64 be happening but the soldiers were not the only ones to cause the turmoil of the past four months
02:59:26.64 --> 02:59:32.48 the finger of blame could be pointed at many Lakota as well in fact they were mostly to blame
02:59:33.60 --> 02:59:39.76 the white agents and the army officers found the flames of jealousy and let little minds that could
02:59:39.76 --> 02:59:47.92 not think beyond the moment and little men who yearned for recognition and power do the rest there was
02:59:47.92 --> 02:59:56.32 no other way to look at it in the end the Lakota defeated themselves they had the whites outnumbered
02:59:56.32 --> 03:00:02.16 an outman and did nothing the entire garrison could have been overrun by the by enough determined
03:00:02.16 --> 03:00:07.84 Lakota fighting men with a good plan if they truly wanted to return to living the old way
03:00:07.84 --> 03:00:16.40 and control of their lands and their lives instead men stepped over each other to betray their own
03:00:16.40 --> 03:00:22.96 relatives in order to obtain the power handed out by the whites a power they couldn't get on their own
03:00:26.40 --> 03:00:32.000 and he details some of this just ego drama that's going on and they have the opportunity you know
03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:38.08 if I'm if I'm in camp and you know Jason crazy horse Jason's out there still being a wild
03:00:38.08 --> 03:00:43.20 Lakota and I want more power in the camp maybe I say you know you don't want to you don't want to
03:00:43.20 --> 03:00:48.80 deal with that Jason crazy or he's too crazy out there you don't want to put him in a power position
03:00:48.80 --> 03:00:52.56 you don't want to get like all these things this happens a buffalo hunt had been promised
03:00:53.36 --> 03:00:58.56 but there'd been no hunt and crazy horse understood why first someone with more power than three
03:00:58.56 --> 03:01:03.76 stars had to say that the Lakota could go chasing buffalo if given the opportunity three stars
03:01:03.76 --> 03:01:09.60 reason the hunters would keep going perhaps all the way to grand mother's land to join sitting
03:01:09.60 --> 03:01:16.80 both which is Canada by the way adding to that some among the Lakota complain to three stars that
03:01:16.80 --> 03:01:21.60 if crazy horse and his young man were allowed to hump buffalo then everyone must be allowed
03:01:22.32 --> 03:01:28.40 and it was a Lakota who warned that it was dangerous to put guns in the hands of crazy horse
03:01:28.40 --> 03:01:37.52 so he's just getting stabbed in the back by you know as is dream pointed out by some of his own people
03:01:40.80 --> 03:01:45.84 after many of the soldier leaders at camp Robinson came to crazy horse with horse with questions
03:01:45.84 --> 03:01:52.000 about the greasy grass fight and the defeat of the long hair which is cluster two agency chief
03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:58.08 sent messages complaining to three star perhaps there was no place for another agency chief
03:01:58.08 --> 03:02:04.000 crazy horse thought to reassure his uncle red cloud that he had no wish to be made a chief of any kind
03:02:04.80 --> 03:02:09.76 but he knew anything he had to say to them would not be regarded as truth but eventually the
03:02:09.76 --> 03:02:15.52 rumors did fly it was said three star would make crazy horse chief over everyone including
03:02:15.52 --> 03:02:20.08 spotted tail and red clouds you can see this is just like political drama to make mark matters
03:02:20.08 --> 03:02:24.32 worse many of the lesser soldier leaders with himself saying that crazy horse could influence the
03:02:24.32 --> 03:02:29.60 younger men better than the two older leaders could through it all he had tried to talk to three
03:02:29.60 --> 03:02:35.28 stars about the promise of a northern agency day after day traveling to Robinson from cottonwood
03:02:35.28 --> 03:02:42.56 creek if you want your agency some of crazy horse's friend said carefully in low voices
03:02:42.56 --> 03:02:47.44 for it was hard to know who might be listening you will have to travel to their place at
03:02:47.44 --> 03:02:52.16 power where the great father lives and speak to him face to face of course they warned
03:02:52.16 --> 03:02:58.24 if three star sends you ahead of red cloud or spotted tail they will find a way to make it
03:02:58.24 --> 03:03:03.04 difficult for us while you're gone they will find a way to take you down when you return
03:03:05.84 --> 03:03:10.88 crazy horse had no wish to travel to the great father and curry favor from a man he didn't know
03:03:11.44 --> 03:03:17.28 you'd be out of place and only something for show someone to perform for the powerful crazy
03:03:17.28 --> 03:03:29.04 horse did not wish to be a thing of curiosity fast forward a little bit more and now he's
03:03:29.04 --> 03:03:35.84 trying to make a deal man he's trying to like get it done he knows what what where these things are
03:03:35.84 --> 03:03:46.32 going he's late in the game but he's trying to make it happen yeah I mean he's got it he's got to
03:03:46.32 --> 03:03:51.36 think about the women in the children at this point and he's like well you know I could keep fighting
03:03:51.36 --> 03:03:57.04 but then who's going to protect them and that's where this is where the guys is so honorable
03:03:57.04 --> 03:04:02.96 because he just he knows where his responsibility is it's not like how many soldiers I can kill
03:04:02.96 --> 03:04:09.60 because he can kill quite a few more and he can probably you know inspire a bunch of the young
03:04:09.60 --> 03:04:16.40 men on the thing to to to rise up but to what end and at the end of the the day it's the women and
03:04:16.40 --> 03:04:21.44 children they're going to suffer so then he's like I gotta try and fix this and negotiate the best
03:04:21.44 --> 03:04:27.44 deal that he can at that point so he starts to put to deal together
03:04:29.20 --> 03:04:35.84 lieutenant Lee the soldier leader in charge at spotted tails agency sent word that crazy horse must
03:04:35.84 --> 03:04:41.84 come to the soldier house crazy horse rode out with touch the clouds and white thunder spotted
03:04:41.84 --> 03:04:47.44 tail and over a hundred of his young men met them on the trail Lee arrived with black crow and
03:04:47.44 --> 03:04:55.36 Louis Bordeaux and was frightened seeing that he was between the minicondue and the aglala
03:04:55.36 --> 03:05:01.44 on one side and spotted tails on the other there were shouts and threats hurled back and forth
03:05:01.44 --> 03:05:05.52 and weapons brandished until crazy horse raised a hand in silence slowly fell over the
03:05:05.52 --> 03:05:11.60 gathering Lee now very frightened told crazy horse that he must return to Robinson and make it
03:05:11.60 --> 03:05:19.28 good with the soldier leaders there so the night past the morning came when the sun arose he
03:05:19.28 --> 03:05:25.20 hurried to the soldier house to speak to lieutenant Lee to assure him that he had not changed his mind
03:05:25.20 --> 03:05:30.32 there's ready to speak with Randall he was one of the leaders to make things good so with touch the
03:05:30.32 --> 03:05:37.36 clouds swift bear and black crow along they started out for camp Robinson the first group of blue
03:05:37.36 --> 03:05:45.76 coded Lakota men met them along the trail they said nothing informed a wide half circle around crazy
03:05:45.76 --> 03:05:52.32 horse and the others further on more blue coded Lakota arrived and now they became a mob of more than
03:05:52.32 --> 03:06:00.000 60 it was then that crazy horse knew he was in trouble so now you have Lakota's that are wearing the the
03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:10.24 military the American military jacket fast thunder was lost in the crowd so tour he
03:06:10.24 --> 03:06:17.44 dog and touch the clouds all around was noise of running and scuffling as if men were pushing
03:06:17.44 --> 03:06:22.24 together crazy horse was pushed toward a square house made of logs a strange place for Randall the
03:06:22.24 --> 03:06:27.92 Bee before he could help himself he was through the open doorway there was a bad smell a man with
03:06:27.92 --> 03:06:36.08 dark hair and braids rose from the corner then he saw the iron bars he spun on a heel and saw
03:06:36.08 --> 03:06:42.96 man little big man blocking the opening crazy horse shoved the shorter man aside and tried to push
03:06:42.96 --> 03:06:49.36 past but almost immediately felt little big man grab both of his arms from behind with a great effort
03:06:49.36 --> 03:06:56.80 he pulled himself free and reached into the opening of his blanket for the knife outside there were
03:06:56.80 --> 03:07:05.20 shouts of both soldiers and the Lakota let me go he said a little big man let me go the man
03:07:06.40 --> 03:07:12.08 the oglala warrior who had written in a battle with him stood fast perhaps it was the blue coat of
03:07:12.08 --> 03:07:18.48 the soldier that had turned his heart with a sudden swipe crazy horse slashed the arm of the coat
03:07:18.48 --> 03:07:26.08 and immediately blood flowed and little big man jump back with a step crazy horse was outside and
03:07:26.08 --> 03:07:30.72 there was movement everywhere more hands grabbed at him from either side brown hands holding
03:07:30.72 --> 03:07:36.72 him fast the strident voice of a soldier yelled from the middle of the confusion came a soldier
03:07:36.72 --> 03:07:45.20 frusting with the knife at the end of his rifle those near him heard crazy horse gasp and saw
03:07:45.20 --> 03:07:52.40 his knees begin to wobble brown hands still holding his arms even as the soldier with
03:07:52.40 --> 03:08:06.40 drew the long knife let me go they heard him say quietly you've gotten me hurt then he fell
03:08:06.40 --> 03:08:25.92 and crazy horse died a few hours later it details that in the book and
03:08:25.92 --> 03:08:41.36 feel and his dream the dream that he had became fulfilled and again it it makes me think about
03:08:41.36 --> 03:08:48.24 that that quote that native American quote from that podcast with with Mike afanke that the
03:08:48.24 --> 03:08:56.96 diagnosis is a curse and this seems to be something similar when you know that thing when we're driving
03:08:57.52 --> 03:09:01.92 go through that driving course and they warn you when you're going through like a tactical driving
03:09:01.92 --> 03:09:05.68 course and you're driving around the track or you're driving in an out of traffic you're doing
03:09:05.68 --> 03:09:09.92 these things and they warn you they give you a warning they say when you're driving if you look at
03:09:09.92 --> 03:09:15.20 something you need what you need to look at is the opening you need to look at the part of the
03:09:15.20 --> 03:09:19.76 track that you can drive you need to look at the part of this this road that you can go through that you
03:09:19.76 --> 03:09:24.88 can make it through because if you look at another car or you look at a guardrail or you look at a
03:09:24.88 --> 03:09:31.12 ditch that's where you're going that's where you're going to end up we go where we aim
03:09:35.12 --> 03:09:45.04 and I don't know this is a self fulfilling prophecy here but it might be and I think it's
03:09:45.04 --> 03:09:56.32 a good idea to try and set your sights on a positive outcome another thought I had about this is
03:09:57.68 --> 03:10:04.88 you know BH Ladell Hart who go listen to some podcasts that I've done on BH Ladell Hart
03:10:04.88 --> 03:10:09.60 the indirect approach but he also talked about the fact that
03:10:09.60 --> 03:10:16.80 what happens to profits you know profits and you have leaders what happens to profits profits
03:10:16.80 --> 03:10:25.36 die when you go out you profit you you make statements and you don't compromise you die
03:10:27.20 --> 03:10:35.36 and your your message will get traction later on and and it's using the leaders that take the
03:10:35.36 --> 03:10:43.60 message from the profit and turn it into something that can be brought to fruition you know they
03:10:43.60 --> 03:10:49.04 they use compromise they use understanding and the usual relationships to to move an idea forward
03:10:49.04 --> 03:10:58.16 in a more practical way but the profits the believers that don't compromise oftentimes
03:10:58.16 --> 03:11:09.04 they're crucified they're killed and pretty clear where crazy horse fell in that
03:11:10.56 --> 03:11:21.44 category which category he fell into powerful lessons to be learned if you want to join us

03:12:32.16 --> 03:12:38.16 had both these battlefields there's so much for us to learn from and we can learn from you know
03:12:38.16 --> 03:12:41.36 in the case of a lot of the things that we heard this soldiers were doing were not
03:12:42.40 --> 03:12:46.56 good to look like hey this is what I'm not going to do this is not an honorable way to behave
03:12:46.56 --> 03:12:56.16 and then we can see within the Lakota are talking about generosity being the a virtue of a warrior
03:12:56.16 --> 03:13:01.60 and then considering that and saying that is a virtue that I want to a strive to as an American
03:13:05.04 --> 03:13:09.76 yeah and that this is such a great way to learn these lessons
03:13:09.76 --> 03:13:19.84 it is thanks for listening if you want to support yourself or you're supporting us you go to

03:14:00.56 --> 03:14:06.88 it's a lot of the way to do it like a lot of these these like native American stories or
03:14:06.88 --> 03:14:13.04 whatever reason I don't know we were talking earlier where I kind of get a little bit more into
03:14:13.04 --> 03:14:18.000 I don't know why maybe because a lot of times it starts with in just right at the beginning
03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:22.16 how they start with how they're raised like how the kids are raised and then you know I have
03:14:22.16 --> 03:14:27.68 young kids on my man I want my kids to be like crazy worse or what was this name before crazy worse
03:14:27.68 --> 03:14:35.04 right here yeah so just from the beginning you're into it you know and then you kind of you
03:14:35.04 --> 03:14:39.28 kind of cheering for me and rooting for him then at the end it's all tragic and then now I got to tell
03:14:39.28 --> 03:14:45.60 everybody how jockel just when goes so healthy for you it is hard to do but it is hard transition

03:15:13.52 --> 03:15:19.60 you can check that we got an online training platform which is which is awesome these these
03:15:19.60 --> 03:15:23.44 leadership lessons that we're talking about they're not they're skills that you can learn look is
03:15:23.44 --> 03:15:30.16 there's some charismatic thing that crazy horse had that maybe we can't give you yes but there's an
03:15:31.04 --> 03:15:37.28 unbelievable number of ways that you can improve your leadership and that's what we what we teach in
03:15:37.28 --> 03:15:42.72 the academy you know at the academy when we do our live sessions right every single one of them now
03:15:42.72 --> 03:15:46.24 someone gives a sit right yeah we're like hey I've been I've been practicing this stuff I'm
03:15:46.24 --> 03:15:50.96 checking my ego I've been working with the other teams on our group and and here's all these massive
03:15:50.96 --> 03:15:58.000 successes and they just compile every week so you can hear from other leaders that are putting
03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:04.24 effort into leadership instead of just not really paying attention to it and then you can quantify
03:16:04.24 --> 03:16:09.52 their successes yeah so cool also to you mentioned like leaders say other leaders whatever
03:16:09.52 --> 03:16:14.16 think a lot of times we talk about this from time to time we're some people some a lot of people I think
03:16:14.16 --> 03:16:18.40 don't hear the word leader and then it's like that's me which kind of they were taught where
03:16:18.40 --> 03:16:23.20 you they're straight up talking about that where it's like hey you don't got to be the general you
03:16:23.20 --> 03:16:28.48 don't got to be the manager you don't even know everyone's kind of like a leader for different
03:16:28.48 --> 03:16:35.84 reasons than the title you know great man and so when you kind of in you know hang around this group
03:16:35.84 --> 03:16:40.32 a lot you know I'm not leading though I'm not I'm not I'm not manager you know nothing like that but
03:16:40.32 --> 03:16:51.04 some of them team yeah but I'm over here uh uh reaping massive you know rewards from you guys
03:16:51.04 --> 03:16:56.000 and it's just me you know from the beginning so I think that's like a the good thing to bring
03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:01.36 up and a good distinction where it's like yeah sure you're talking to quote unquote leaders
03:17:01.36 --> 03:17:06.32 but it's not just the boss you know it's like everybody's on there no there's and there's individuals
03:17:06.32 --> 03:17:10.40 whether there maybe they're running their own business or they're just working somewhere yeah and
03:17:10.40 --> 03:17:16.08 they're they're leading themselves and they're part of the mission yeah and you get we get great
03:17:16.08 --> 03:17:22.80 feedback from them too you know and here's another thing this translates everywhere so
03:17:23.60 --> 03:17:29.92 in the last couple I've been in people have talked about parenting issues
03:17:29.92 --> 03:17:36.72 oh for sure the leadership straight up the life time leadership and they're like hey I had
03:17:36.72 --> 03:17:41.20 you know I had this issue and I've been having this issue with my son and then I realized
03:17:42.08 --> 03:17:46.72 wait a minute it's not my son it's something that I'm doing wrong and I've adjusted the way that I
03:17:46.72 --> 03:17:51.04 interact with them and now things are great you know and they're looking at themselves first and
03:17:51.04 --> 03:17:55.04 taking ownership and if that what you just said hits you if you're listening this right now you just
03:17:55.04 --> 03:18:01.28 heard Jason say that like oh it's something wrong with me as a parent and you all that's bullshit
03:18:01.84 --> 03:18:05.76 I'm that's my kid you better do what I tell if that's what you're out of two days I'm telling
03:18:05.76 --> 03:18:10.48 you got a rude awakening coming your way the it is leadership it's the same you want to
03:18:10.48 --> 03:18:18.64 impose stuff on your children it's not gonna go well for you it's not so be careful that thing you
03:18:18.64 --> 03:18:25.36 just there are said about the the example whatever where it's like oh yeah I use like this lesson
03:18:25.36 --> 03:18:31.60 looked at myself for whatever you know anytime or I looked at it as no it's not them not doing the
03:18:31.60 --> 03:18:36.48 right thing it's me not doing the right thing every single time hundred percent not the 99
03:18:36.48 --> 03:18:42.88 maybe I'll come to you know you know hundred percent of the time it worked when I have a discipline
03:18:42.88 --> 03:18:48.000 issue with my kids and then I do run the internal debrief or Iris gives me the debriefs
03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:55.52 like I'm like how's it going check it's then it gets fixed and I'm like well this is what I
03:18:55.52 --> 03:18:59.52 did wrong and this is what I need to do better next time I do those things next time and then
03:18:59.52 --> 03:19:05.20 they're in an issue yeah just thanks so that's the that's extreme ownership extreme ownership
