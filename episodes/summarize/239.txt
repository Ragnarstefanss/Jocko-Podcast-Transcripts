so you think oh we got a machine gun up there we need a call for fire and now you think about how hard it's going to be for the start to lead a hit this place that's bunkered in or they're on the reverse slope of a mountain or whatever it's a real problem and yet these guys realize if they just aggressively maneuvered on that machine gun they'd be able to take it out the attue action likewise indicated that standard japini's infiltration tactics can be offset by a system of anti-termite patrols organized behind our lines protecting artillery command posts and supply lines wherever troops know that these friendly patrols were behind them fire in a rear will mean separate that our patrols are cleaning people up goes into the south Pacific talking about the jungle jungle notes aggressive action flexible plant plans report of the 43rd division new Georgia aggressive action is necessary never relax the pressure never relax the pressure that's a good that's a good just thing to think about every time you wake up in the morning never relax the pressure maneuver of small units at risk of temporary loss of communications is important plans and orders must be so flexible as to permit prompt maneuver change this is another thing where I would feel like I was cheating when I was you know going through training and stuff because we would make these really flexible plans and of course the training cadre is gonna do things to disrupt your plan and when your plan gets disrupted and it's super flexible like I would ever you know go plan be go with plan C and then you move because if you pop your head up again in that same spot you're going to take one common in all these accounts of a successful night attack by a small unit the application of the following principles is worthy of note close control during the approach by the use of control lines adjusted to difficult terrain features designation of a line of departure as close to the objective as possible and after all major terrain obstacles have been passed this is a essential to assure proper organization of the unit immediately prior to the so you can to apply that right there so many business things right there like you get everything ready to go you get past all the main obstacles once everyone's passed the main obstacles then you execute attainment of the vital surprise use of the bayonet and hand grenades with no weapon firing permitted it may often be advisable to prohibit the loading of rifles and for anyone that doesn't understand why these guys are talking about using grenades so much grenades do not give away your position neither do bayonets so you can hug grenades and no one knows where it just came from there's no one to shoot at there's no muscle flush and so it's a great weapon when you are attacking from like a clandestine situation where you don't want the enemy to know where you are you so front of attack only any attempt at development tends to cause disorder and confusion note that one puttune which had advanced ahead of the general lines was pulled back to conform so they're saying frontal attack only and what they're saying is don't try and surround because if you try and surround people at night and you're gonna end up on opposite sides and you're gonna end up in a blue on blue situation I don't think that they mean don't set up flank situations a definite and limited objective capture of an airfield in this case in which the entire front could be covered by manpower rather than firepower all that's good these are the major elements of successful night attack brought out in the foregoing account others not mentioned but which were undoubtedly contributing contributing factors of the operation are careful planning in my new detail precise specific orders careful arrangement for maintenance of direction throw daylight reconnaissance by as many of the leaders as possible use of compound use of compact columns in the approach so the reason that they're saying precise specific orders that's different that's different than what we normally talk about the reason is because you are attempting to make this happen without having the enemy get a vote so once the enemy gets a vote if you two specific things change now we don't know what to do but we are setting this thing up to be very specific and we should be able to get to our last point of concealment we should be in our positions everything should be good once that attack starts but I wrote all this stuff about hey when you're calling in a helicopter here's what you need to do and I'm going to find this because I have this book I have it and one of the things I said was leave one helicopter at altitude to provide cover fire for the helicopter that's on the ground and here I was a new guy kind of thinking that I had a little something you know had a little something for these guys and that's one of the initial kind of thoughts around or me starting to realize that cover move wasn't just that that really was the fundamental of everything that we were doing and the other thing that I scratched down when when I talk about people you're talking about people being really good at their jobs I was doing some kind of an exercise at the camp Pendleton and somehow we got linked into a mortar a Marine Corps mortar element and bro these guys were doing Iads immediate action drills with their mortars and you know I just remember watching them and I don't know what I don't know how you put words I don't know what you know they were you know they're freaking 18 years old I know they at least think of the Darby Queen the the ranger off-school course in our work we always use the buddy system the men work in pairs they live in pairs even pairs do garden pairs even do kp in pairs confidence and jugglers developed they can pick their own buddy from within their platoon same thing in the seal teams day one you get a swim buddy and stick with them realism in our training we never do anything without battle noises and effects we always use live ammunition we use mines barbed wire and protective bands of machine gun fire extensively if the problem is to capture a machine gun nest there's always a machine gun nest there with a machine gun firing in a fixed direction the men very quickly get a custom to having live ammunition flying around them capture the telling the German machine guns and machine pistols are used by the enemy in our problems that he's talking about the out for our men quickly learn to distinguish between the fire of our own weapons and that of enemy weapons also the enemy makes constant use of flares we always carry our normal load of ammunition with weapons loaded if a man knows his weapon is loaded he will be more careful in handling it an accidental discharge of a weapon automatically means a fine and immediate reduction to the grade of private in our work we must take drastic measures to guard against accidental discharge of weapons we learned our lesson in Tunisia where the accidental discharge of a rifle cleared a raid and caused a 24 hour delay in operations so all kinds of good stuff in there and and I will say this so when I got the seal teams it was almost all live fire we did live fire for everything and it gave you that kind of pressure and that kind of you you got a custom to machine guns and hearing them and you know round snapping overhead and you do you got used to it in fact there were days where they would put us down range and just shoot you know put put put you down range you'd go behind a berm or whatever you get in a safe spot and then they just shoot at you so you'd start getting used to like so you Dave shouldn't take your squad beyond where my range the web the range of my weapons and then when you start to talk about that that means you know communications as well if I don't get you know communications with you then I can't support you if my weapons can't reach out and touch and give you support then we're not in supporting distance and that's too far away what does that mean you just change your perspective a little bit and dispersion which is positive but if you get too far apart it's negative so these lessons are the same over time and yet we still have to teach because we still make mistakes and when we learn things from a different angle and even reading a document yesterday that's thousands or the last podcast that's a document thousands of years old you'd think yourself that after thousands of years thousands of years we would be talking about these leadership principles in the most commonly known way that everybody just like you know I couldn't have written extreme ownership because people would have been just you know saying hey no kidding dude what are you talking about this is this is part of the fabric of life but these things aren't they're they're not they're not the fabric of life they're they just seem to need to be rediscovered over and over again which is which is horrible but one thing I think allows us to learn them in a more complete way is seeing them from different angles from other experiences and today we're going to take a look at combat lessons which you know yeah get aggressive making it happen because if you just make a flexible plan and you think hey you know you guys come in from the west and you guys come in from the south there's all kinds of things that go wrong with that plan it's super flexible but no one knows where they can't go where they can't go there's no deconfliction set up so you need to think about it the other thing that's interesting about aggressive action flexible plans is the more you plan the more detail you get the worse your plan becomes now if you come up with a plan in three minutes you probably need a little bit more time although I have executed operations where I we planned for 15 minutes my boss asked me that my boss said how much time do you guys need to launch this is my first deployment my second deployment no one asked me they already knew the answer my first point how much time you guys need I was like 15 minutes that's how much time what you're getting at though is the propensity of what how the things usually work out do we usually plan too much or not enough it's pretty rare that we don't plan enough what typically happens is we overplan an overplan an overplan and there's an old saying I don't know if it's just an aviation it's how long do you have to plan your mission and the joke is thirty how long do you need to plan your mission and the joke is the thirty minutes more than you have and the reason is is we have a propensity to overplan when I then it's talked about this in extreme ownership when I was telling those guys hey just make a plan that the lowest common denominator I get up have people walk through it look at the map use the map draw a picture draw it up on the whiteboard do that I remember Seth was looking at me like he was going to get fired like when he gives this brief he's going to get fired and it's funny because usually I would get that I would feel a little bit more push back from life on stuff and Seth would be like rea Roger and Lave would have why would we do like that and this time for whatever reason I think I think Lave actually just realized that this was the smartest thing he'd ever heard I think Lave just said to himself you know what this actually freaking makes sense and he was so on board with it he was so stoked and he had BTF Tony was his chief and that's the way you know Tony knew how to make shit happen yeah the context of the night pieces also I think really important because it seems what he's what they're saying is that there's a lot more close control under a night attack requires a whole lot of things because when the chaos ensues under an attack you were denied something that you usually rely on so heavily and when you were reading that and again it's under the context of a night assault it's different it's different at night you told a story long time ago that I've used a bunch and there's a version of it I have from flying which was when we started using NVG's the way we described the use of NVG's why we would use NVG's in airplane is the most simplest way to describe it is it allows us to use daytime tactics at night which before you just couldn't do you actually you want the least amount of close control is possible you need to have some but in the day you don't need it as much because you can rely on being able to see each other and when you started to see people like reject the idea of things that allowed you to maneuver in different ways using technology because why would I do it like that the night creates an environment that's really hard to operate in and if you're going to be successful at night you have to do a lot more things than you would normally do during the day which is why some of the technology pieces are so nice to allow you to do it but even with that you can't pretend like the two are the same and the detail is going through I'm all thinking next one leaders in front staff sergeant Richard E. Deeland infantry Sicily we want our captains out front we don't much care about the position of our battalion commander that's it that's all that's a whole note keep them moving operation report seven tharmysicely during an attack officers and noncommission officers must never allow men to lie prone and and passive under enemy fire they must be required to move forward if this is at all possible if movement is absolutely impossible have the troops at least open fire the act of firing induces self confidence in attacking troops the familiar expression dig or die has been greatly overworked attacking troops must not be allowed to dig in until they have secured their final objective if they dig in when momentarily stopped by enemy fire it will take dynamite to blast them from their holes and resume the advance this is another thing and we're going to get into some of this there's another element again where you get to total war and and that's what that's what that's what that's what these things are leaning towards we're in a totally different situation you know this is this is an existential war where if we don't win America's not going to exist freedom will not exist in the world nco leadership staff sergeant Robert J. Camp platoon sergeant infantry Sicily nco leadership is important leaders nco's an officer should be taken to an OP for terrain instruction and study before an attack this has been possible in my outfit about one fourth of the time we have what is called an orders group which consists of that group of officers and nco's that must be assembled for instruction before any tactical move simple clear concise orders get people together get face to face with them look at the terrain show them what they're seeing show them where they're going to move to and this seems real obvious and yet this guy is saying hey you better do it keep your mission in mind Colonel eb fayer field artillery observer with fifth army Italy difficulty was experienced in making patrol leaders realized the importance of bringing back information by a specified hour in time to be a value patrols often returned after encountering resistance without accomplishing their mission sending them back to accomplish their mission despite their fatigue seem to be the most effective solution to the training problem involved although the information required often arrived to late yeah they got the the the japanese on their attack made it they broke through and it was fighting in the rear lieutenant general Simon B. Buckner commanding general asking department it was apparent that the enemy was particularly vulnerable to attack by units of our infantry which pushed forward vigorously while the enemy was held down by artillery fire what we call that you cover move those units which had learned to advance closely behind their own artillery supporting fire had the greatest success the japs do not like our coordinated artillery fire nor do they like our attacks with the bayonet when under fire from small arms they stay down in their holes and are easily approached when attacking small groups of foxholes our troops were able to keep the japs down by fire from rifles and the browning automatic rifle while some of our men approached and drop hang grenades into their holes this is our favorite mop up method cover move when about to be run out of a position the japs seem to feel it necessary to counter attack these attacks were not well coordinated and were welcomed by our troops who were able to shoot down the enemy in great numbers these jap counter attacks were part of a suicidal character and were pressed home regardless of losses until practically all the counter attack and troops were exterminated the enemy may believe that in such terrain he can hold up the advance of an entire battalion with three men and a light machine gun in fact however he is critically vulnerable to intelligent action by officers and men who understand the necessity for immediate maneuver against small parties of the enemy seeking to hold them up the fact was that a small maneuvering that small maneuvering patrols easily disposed of machine gun positions on reverse slopes behind mount spurs whereas any tendency to lie down and call for artillery support whatever resulted only in tremendous wastage of artillery fire and attempting to seek out targets which in fact were inaccessible artillery fire that's an important point oh that's too good to be true there's a right machine gun that's waiting to be taken out looks real obvious an obvious trap and yet the warning is there why is the warning still there because people still fall for it you will still fall for it I will still fall for it we will all still fall for that trap just like we will fall for the trap that we're good to go that we know everything that we need to know that we understand everything that we need to understand that we have reached our highest possible form then all those little thoughts are a trap because we're not good then we don't know everything we don't understand everything and we have absolutely not reached our highest form we all have work to do so watch out for that trap because it is enticing it is enticing like a low machine gun just gonna sit out there by itself waiting to be taken out and it's real easy to tell yourself that you're good I think some of it depends on the circumstances you know if you have an actual discharge in the seal teams it's going to be your careers your careers are the line you know if you if you have something like that happen it's not necessarily going to be over but you're going to have a real you're going to have to keep your hopes up they don't that you don't get so even like like a called AD right or AD AD and the which is a negligent discharge I think they are now I'm not like totally caught up on the terminology of where it's at right now the and the just started coming around when I was sort of in my later years that's kind of you know I say oh you know leadership principles stay the same and when you read through the woozy you start to get some supporting evidence to that because he's talking about the fact that you need to be beloved but never and you need to treat people well and treat them with respect and take care of your people which is all things that you know I talk about we all talk about but then in the woozy it also says to execute anyone that disobeyes your orders so so that leads you to think well maybe some principles have changed and you know I used to actually have a rationalization for this or an excuse for this and what I would say is there's there's a difference in leadership when you're leading conscripts instead of volunteers and so as leadership moved away from or military leadership and that by the way when you go back in time it's not just military leadership because what are the people the people are surfs and peasants and they're being led by these kings with divine power they're literally looking out the windows trying to see where we were and we walked in shot them all in the back rescued our guy but the what's important here is any goes into like a little bit a little bit more detail but you because we're being quiet you have to have good control lines of where you're going to let people get to hand the hand fighting Captain Gerald infantry at Biscari airport I used my trench knife twice one of my man got three with his bayonet he shot one then another tried to grab his bayonet he got this one with his bayonet that got him started so he got three in before it was all over small arms against arm we found that the the 30 caliber AP pierces enemy armored half tracks at close ranges that's something that everybody should know put to an action lieutenant hallrich infantry when the enemy machine guns opened up with three grenades the machine guns pulled back out of grenade fire then NCOs and Browning automatic riflemen went up over the embankment through and beyond the initial enemy positions eventually we had a base of fire about 20 men including the bars the BARs during the enemy counter attacks we did pretty well with other fire two led was flying fast and fiercely at 20 to 30 yards we fire at flashes in this kind of firing you learn to fire and roll to one side or they will soon get you but I'm going to read it a Luger pistol was found lying on the ground an American infantry lieutenant carefully tied a long court to it and then getting into a hole pulled it to him and put it in his pocket later in the day while examining the pistol he attempted to remove the magazine the explosion killed the lieutenant and two other men with six soldiers wounded the reason I'm reading that is because that was a freaking they set that thing up that's a that's a massive explosion from a small piece of from a small pistol timelyness of orders major kidney infantry are chief difficulty throughout the campaign was the lack of time given for the execution of orders frequently received operations orders which did not allow enough time for proper preparation and execution at San Fratello we received an order after 11 p.m. to attack at six a.m. the next morning now when I read that I was like hey man that's kind of thinking you all said I'll come up with a simple flexible plan no factor I got this what are they whining about read on the six battagans were assembly were in assembly areas some five or six miles from the line of departure so even to get to where they were supposed to leave from the had to go six miles the terrain over which they had to move to get in position in the dark was the roughest most rugged mountain country you can imagine and all ammunition weapons it supplies had to be taken by hand and by muelpack although it might seem that 11 p.m. to six a.m. was sufficient time the actual conditions were such that it was less than half done enough because the terrain darkness and transport difficulties also the men had just completed marches over mountain trails of nine to 14 miles and we're not fresh for the new movement maps seven th Army report Sicily instill an all personnel and appreciation of the value of maps the supply of maps will never be adequate to the demand training in the care and preservation of maps is as important as training in the care and preservation of material most important thing you need to know most important piece of information is where you are and if your map is destroyed have you received those old school silk maps and I don't know watch TV or something that piece of it when you're talking about that discipline what you get when you hold yourself to the exact same standard as your people Basil section two field artillery morale effect the incestant firing of our artillery during the six week period produced contrasting effects on the nerves of our own troops and on those the enemy our infantry often stated that having those rounds continually landing in front of them was one of the best morale builders especially at night in the jab on the other hand it produced severe cases of war neurosis he couldn't sleep at night because he never knew when or where the next round was going to land he couldn't sleep in the daytime because when our infantry wasn't attacking him our artillery was giving him hell and this is nice the following statements made by prisoners are interesting so these are Japanese prisoners of which we know there wasn't a lot between the airport between be below hill and the airport we had many guns of all sizes before this campaign but now many of them are gone knocked out by artillery it is completely demoralized many units reduced many units in strength and has made many men go crazy we were awakened at night by the slightest noise because of the bad state of nerves at night three men stayed in one foxhole two smoked while one slept during the day we also tried to get some sleep by alternating but the continual artillery fire kept us on edge and we got no rest even in the two story dugouts many men were killed just by concussion a direct hit would kill all the men inside the artillery is the one thing that is universally feared by all our ground troops it continues over such long periods of time and the rounds come so fast except for the artillery we could continue our defense that's horror that's just horror section three miscellaneous booby traps seventh army report Sicily a German Luger pistol was booby trapped on a table new replacement picked it up two were killed and 14 were wounded in the resulting explosion there's another little set I wasn't going to read this where in the jungle you might have forgotten that patrolling in the jungle an officer with considerable experience in the jungle patrolling gives this advice patrols are most likely to give away their presence in an area by their footprints shine from the smallest metal surface such as a belt buckle or watch must be avoided a luminous watch constitutes a real danger and he noise such as talking coughing, spitting, etc. must have to be treated with the greatest of all dangers a man on patrol must learn to move silently making every possible use of natural cover that's just old school stuff I got to feel something I was hunting it's like so happy to be moving quietly some more patrol tips positioning camouflage are more important than I learned in the states in training in training bear down on covering concealment bear down on avoidance of the blundering approach on patrols on fire maneuver which are equally important and I didn't read that well in training bear down on covering concealment bear down on the avoidance of blundering approach on patrols on fire maneuver which are equally important size of patrols the tenant kernel w a walker tank destroyer battalion commander Tunisia which you know let's just face it you're getting a title tank destroyer battalion commander is right up there many men were lost in Tunisia by using squad patrols the Germans used stronger patrols and just gobbled them up a patrol should be either a sneak patrol small enough to escape detection or a combat patrol large enough to fight its way out of difficulty never allow one man to go out alone you know what's interesting about that we don't want to be balanced like well I mean you think he was so freaked out by the fact of thinking that he was getting fired for for trying to make his men understand what was going to happen on this mission and the cool thing was the commanding officer when when they got done because it was two platoon's going out on on an SR you know on a reconnaissance mission and they both took their platoon's out when they got done the you know the commanding officer who had gone around and watched all the platoon's give all their briefs and give all these 150 power points slides and do all these you know what what is it called animation in your slides he'd watched all those things and he he said these these are the best briefs of scene which was freaking
