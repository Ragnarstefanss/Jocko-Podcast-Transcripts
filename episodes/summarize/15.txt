and when I watch the professionals do this I don't think they get the emotion I don't think they understand the leadership I don't think they get the fear and the blood and the death and I don't think they understand war and when these actors take these great words that are crafted brilliantly and they try and say them like leaders to me they still sound like actors they don't sound like men that have fathered and don't sound like men that have seen battle they definitely don't sound like men that have seen war I think Henry the fifth would have sounded different this is what I think would be closer to what Henry the fifth a combat leader would have sounded like as he as he answered some one of his subordinate leaders out there in the crowd saying that we need more people we need more men I think this is what he would have sounded like what's he that wishes so my cousin was moreland know my fair cousin if we are marked to die we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the few men the greater share of honor God's will I pray the wish not one more man by jove So, and it depends your mood to, like if you're just messing around with me or whatever, you're like, you know, this is kind of weird, but you do this thing that no one really does, and you look like you look me in the eye, like while you're rolling, it's weird, because I know you're just messing with me, like, like, everything I do, you're like, oh, who knows cute kind of kind of an attitude, and then, you know, if I talk too much, you know, whatever, then you'll, yeah, But then that, you know, the big story was that the guys were like, hey, we'll go again if you, you know, because you're such a great leader will go again in Laef, you know, was kind of like, that's what World War, you know, that's what, that's what happened. but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words hairy the king bedford next to her warwick and talbot salsbury and claustar being there flowing cups freshly remembered this story shall the good man teaches son and crispy and crispy and shall narrow go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered we have a few we have a few we bend of brothers for who for he today that shed his blood with me shall be my brother be he near so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentleman in England now a bed shall think themselves a curse that they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispian's day now that is a speech and that is like I said there's a lot more to it than what I covered there's so much depth there and that's why it's lasted the ages and that's why you hear people talking about brotherhood and this is what they refer to and as far as Shakespeare goes and I talk all the time about getting stronger and faster and getting smarter and stronger and faster that's yeah obviously I think you would too but what we did but people asked though they're like hey this is great but some people they'll they'll sign up something I guess other podcasts they'll have situations where you can sign up and just enter your credit card and it'll take out like a dollar a month or something as like a thing this guy Yeah, and surprisingly, and I think that people, a lot of people, wouldn't really assume this right away, is that you're, um, yeah, sure, you're gonna smash and you're aggressive and kind of rough a lot of times, but you're like, um, like a playful, you get to guy. you don't know and phrases you don't know and concepts you don't know you find them and you learn them you teach yourself the resources are there and by the way you know what it's free there's no gym fees there's no equipment to buy you can get all of Shakespeare his entire canon on the internet for free hmm I know that I want to once you'll officer that I was working with, we were going through land warfare training and land warfare training is you got machine guns firing, you got rockets going off, you got smoke grenades, it's man. You know, I mean, it is like, you know, a classic example is telling guys, okay, we're going to take Iraqi soldiers on every operation. and I you know what I know I'm a nobody I know I'm just some guy and these people a lot of people at study Shakespeare and did it on stage and all of a sudden I'm just an ignorant You know, when, you know, when we're surfing where I surf, like it's, it's a gang mentality type situation, you know. Every day, this was their job, even like the mine clearance operations, you know, you're going out and you're going out to go and get blown up or try and look for things that are going to blow you up. You want to push them mentally and physically and you want to have them understand a very important premise because if you take the fact that these guys are let's call them softer, well that means they want to have like you know they want to be safe. So like I said, anyone that's home in England and that word of bed it's like implies being lazy and sleeping they're going to curse that they weren't there and they'll know that they weren't real men They sent them over and, you know, Lee was regretting and I'm sorry and I did something like, I got you, you know, bunch of guys killed. I am not covetous for gold nor cari who do our feet upon my cost it earns me not if men my garments wear such outward things to well not my desires but if it be a sin to covet honor I am the most defending soul alive no faith my cousin wish not a man from England God's peace I would not lose so great and honor as one man more me thinks would share for me for the best hope I have oh do not wish one more rather proclaim it west moreland for my host that he which has no stomach to this fight let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy shall be put into his purse we would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us this day is called the feast of crispy and leave that out lives this day and it comes home safe will stand a tiptoe when the day is named and rouse him at the name of crispy and he that shall see this day and live old age will yearly on the video feast his neighbors and say tomorrow is Saint Crispian then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say these wounds I had on crispy and stay old men forget yet all shall be forgot It's either be aggressive or you're not being aggressive kind of thing, but it's so hard because like for example, if you're in life, a lot of people they sit back and wait for things to kind of happen like, oh, I'm waiting. Yeah, you, um, another way to kind of look at that is a, like, a black and white mind, you know, you don't, like, don't stick. You know, going with a normal haircut, that's not going to make that big of a deal because, you know, they're going to shave your head within moments of showing up. You know, like, I think that someone who may be never seen your role or never had that experience with you specifically, they would assume that you're this like, heavy, mindy, that's going to show. Yeah, and really that's really the core of the evaluation, is that when you roll with people, it's like you're real, um, it's like variable style, you know, it changes.
