00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.96 This is Jockel Pondcast number 287.
00:00:02.96 --> 00:00:05.40 Bethesios and me.
00:00:05.40 --> 00:00:06.40 Jockel willing.
00:00:06.40 --> 00:00:07.40 Good evening, Eco.
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.40 Good evening.
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:11.40 And joining us again is Dave Verk, good evening, Dave.
00:00:11.40 --> 00:00:12.40 Good evening.
00:00:12.40 --> 00:00:18.36 So listen, if you've been tracking, we have been talking about BH LaDale Hart.
00:00:18.36 --> 00:00:20.72 We've been talking about his strategy, the indirect approach.
00:00:20.72 --> 00:00:23.44 We've been covering his book, the strategy of indirect approach.
00:00:23.44 --> 00:00:27.44 Then we rolled into his book, which is just called strategy.
00:00:27.44 --> 00:00:37.28 This stuff is, it's just, it's so important to wrap your head around this stuff.
00:00:37.28 --> 00:00:41.04 It's a lot of it is counterintuitive when you hear it.
00:00:41.04 --> 00:00:44.000 It's counterintuitive when you hear it.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.96 It's sometimes even more counterintuitive when you try and do it.
00:00:49.96 --> 00:00:57.40 And if you understand it and you do it and you execute it, it is a game changer in
00:00:57.40 --> 00:01:02.04 the way you execute and it's also a game changer in the way you think.
00:01:02.04 --> 00:01:08.52 So if you haven't yet listened to 285 and 286, to learn a little bit about BH LaDale
00:01:08.52 --> 00:01:18.16 Hart, who is a veteran soldier, a British soldier, World War I, wounded multiple times,
00:01:18.16 --> 00:01:23.28 sent back from the front multiple times, sent back to the front multiple times, fought
00:01:23.28 --> 00:01:24.60 in the battle of a song.
00:01:24.60 --> 00:01:31.60 I mean, just almost as whole the Italian wiped out, gravely wounded with Gai, he was gasped.
00:01:31.60 --> 00:01:36.04 I mean, been to how I'm back quite literally.
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:39.16 There's not too many people we can talk about, obviously, that fought in the battle of
00:01:39.16 --> 00:01:41.16 a song.
00:01:41.16 --> 00:01:46.88 On the last podcast, I was talking about the fact that he, you know, we throw the words
00:01:46.88 --> 00:01:49.64 battle tested around, like all this battle tested.
00:01:49.64 --> 00:01:55.48 How about battle tested in what's actually the worst battle ever?
00:01:55.48 --> 00:02:00.56 That's where he kind of started to think about the strategy and tactics that we're
00:02:00.56 --> 00:02:01.56 being used.
00:02:01.56 --> 00:02:08.08 This is what sort of when he talks about the indirect approach is the antithesis to what
00:02:08.08 --> 00:02:10.12 World War I was.
00:02:10.12 --> 00:02:18.56 So if you haven't yet, go back and listen to 285 and 286 and then join us right now with
00:02:18.56 --> 00:02:22.48 287 Dave and the intro remarks.
00:02:22.48 --> 00:02:24.48 No, you were writing down there.
00:02:24.48 --> 00:02:31.28 Yeah, I was thinking about the last podcast that we did and just where he's coming from
00:02:31.28 --> 00:02:36.76 and I'm actually super stoked to get to these concluding, these, the end of this section
00:02:36.76 --> 00:02:39.84 or this, this trilogy.
00:02:39.84 --> 00:02:46.60 Because I was saying this last time I think this is all new.
00:02:46.60 --> 00:02:52.60 Like I get to hear this in real time and the sort of the chronology of your very first
00:02:52.60 --> 00:02:56.08 introduction from 285 was like, hey, a little bit of the background of heart, but I didn't
00:02:56.08 --> 00:03:02.40 really, I didn't really sink in as you were saying it of what you just said, like what
00:03:02.40 --> 00:03:10.12 he went through and you said it left a mark on him, but I did not, I did not appreciate
00:03:10.12 --> 00:03:21.04 the depth of that mark and what it compelled him to do to try to course correct this massive,
00:03:21.04 --> 00:03:24.60 this massive mistake that he had to endure in witness.
00:03:24.60 --> 00:03:31.64 So I have, I think I've been able to understand what he's been saying a lot better as you've
00:03:31.64 --> 00:03:35.04 been reading it thinking about where he came from.
00:03:35.04 --> 00:03:39.36 You know what I should have done is I should have gone, well first of all, I should
00:03:39.36 --> 00:03:44.84 have given a little bit more detail there, but I also should have gone back, there's so
00:03:44.84 --> 00:03:50.000 many references to be a Tula del Hart in so many manuals, it's ridiculous.
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.80 And I should have pulled some of those up and said, oh, when we did this Marine Corps manual,
00:03:54.80 --> 00:03:57.92 when I did this Army manual, here's where this come from, here's the roots of this statement
00:03:57.92 --> 00:04:01.68 because they, they cite, they cite him.
00:04:01.68 --> 00:04:08.88 So I guess part of it is, there's some other podcast that I have in the hopper in my mind
00:04:08.88 --> 00:04:15.84 that I want to do that I really can't do without people understanding this idea of the strategy
00:04:15.84 --> 00:04:16.84 of the indirect approach.
00:04:16.84 --> 00:04:18.84 I just can't, I can't go forward.
00:04:18.84 --> 00:04:20.48 It's like I had to do this.
00:04:20.48 --> 00:04:29.84 So I will go back, I'm sure, and do some more historical context around his life and
00:04:29.84 --> 00:04:32.000 what he went through.
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.68 But I also, man, I wanted to get this stuff out there.
00:04:34.68 --> 00:04:38.16 You know, it's like a prioritize next Q drill to be quite frank with you.
00:04:38.16 --> 00:04:46.80 I would, I wanted to get people to understand this and see how beneficial it can be for their
00:04:46.80 --> 00:04:53.52 thought process because it's been so beneficial for my, for the last 30 years of my life,
00:04:53.52 --> 00:04:59.32 maybe 20, 25 years of my life where I realized, wait a second.
00:04:59.32 --> 00:05:00.84 Going direct isn't always the best thing.
00:05:00.84 --> 00:05:05.000 In fact, the more I figured that out, the more I was like, oh, going direct is usually
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.04 not the best thing.
00:05:07.04 --> 00:05:10.12 Quite often the indirect approach is correct.
00:05:10.12 --> 00:05:13.48 It's the correct thing in Jiu-Jitsu, it's the correct thing in battlefield, it's
00:05:13.48 --> 00:05:18.36 a correct thing as a leader, it's a correct thing interacting with other human beings.
00:05:18.36 --> 00:05:22.36 So that's kind of where we are, how we got here.
00:05:22.36 --> 00:05:26.78 You know, a lot, a lot, that's the weird thing about having a podcast and doing things via
00:05:26.78 --> 00:05:33.64 podcast is part of the benefit as of it is the immediacy of it.
00:05:33.64 --> 00:05:35.36 Like, there's not.
00:05:35.36 --> 00:05:38.56 You know, if you write a book, if I was to write a book about this stuff, it would take
00:05:38.56 --> 00:05:40.84 three years, now two years.
00:05:40.84 --> 00:05:43.68 Like if I just was gave up everything else in set, I'm going to write a book about this,
00:05:43.68 --> 00:05:47.96 it would take two years to do, to get it, to get it written, to get it published, to get
00:05:47.96 --> 00:05:53.28 it, ever started to get it written, edited, I go, there's so much lag time to do a podcast,
00:05:53.28 --> 00:05:57.12 it's like, cool, you know what, here's a book, I've had this book for a long time,
00:05:57.12 --> 00:06:00.24 I actually gave you my extra copy of this book.
00:06:00.24 --> 00:06:05.04 So, to put to be able to say, you know what, I want to get this done now is the time
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:06.84 to boom, you can go and execute it.
00:06:06.84 --> 00:06:12.28 And what you sacrifice is you sacrifice some perfection, right?
00:06:12.28 --> 00:06:17.08 You sacrifice some perfection because head, I sat there and thought about the best way to do
00:06:17.08 --> 00:06:21.08 this, maybe I would say, you know what I need to, I need an entire episode about the
00:06:21.08 --> 00:06:26.08 battle of the song, I need an entire episode about what gassing does to you, I need to
00:06:26.08 --> 00:06:31.08 do an episode about his battalion with the Yorkshire Light Regiment, right, and talk about
00:06:31.08 --> 00:06:32.08 exactly who is in it.
00:06:32.08 --> 00:06:36.04 There's a whole bunch of different things I could have done and it's not, and that's
00:06:36.04 --> 00:06:39.12 there, that would have made this better.
00:06:39.12 --> 00:06:44.64 And that's one of the, one of the compromises that you make in moving forward and executing,
00:06:44.64 --> 00:06:49.16 like, you know what, I'm looking back now, hindsight 2020, cool, should have done that,
00:06:49.16 --> 00:06:51.40 didn't do it, we'll do it in the future.
00:06:51.40 --> 00:06:53.68 So, where it goes?
00:06:53.68 --> 00:06:59.000 Yeah, and even for me, as I, as I contemplate what I'm trying to say, you talk about, you
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.84 sacrifice the perfection of your sacrifice, even the way I'm trying to say what I'm thinking
00:07:03.84 --> 00:07:07.96 is not exactly right, it's not how I would say it if I spent time to sit down with a
00:07:07.96 --> 00:07:12.72 pen and paper and write out what I'm thinking or what I'm thinking about or the references
00:07:12.72 --> 00:07:19.96 I'm making in my head, but to be able to sort of reflect in real time as you're reading this,
00:07:19.96 --> 00:07:26.04 as inaccurate or not as eloquent as I'd like it to be, it's a really cool exercise, as
00:07:26.04 --> 00:07:34.000 they listener of leadership to think about hearing what he's saying, contemplating the
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.40 frame of reference he had and how it applies to our world, which is, you don't need
00:07:42.40 --> 00:07:49.24 to be in war ever one to recognize how absolutely directly affected you can be by thinking
00:07:49.24 --> 00:07:52.40 about what he's saying and applying it to your day-to-day life and how you interact with
00:07:52.40 --> 00:07:58.000 people, which is kind of crazy to think about it, but it's also true.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.20 And I guess if there's a problem with any of this, if there's a problem with any of the
00:08:02.20 --> 00:08:07.44 things that you're saying is that there's nothing sexy about the indirect approach,
00:08:07.44 --> 00:08:10.76 it doesn't like, it doesn't play well.
00:08:10.76 --> 00:08:15.12 Like, you're not, I'm going to get up and give a speech about the indirect approach.
00:08:15.12 --> 00:08:17.72 Men, we're going to subordinate our egos today.
00:08:17.72 --> 00:08:24.48 It doesn't, the language doesn't work. It doesn't give you that satisfaction that people
00:08:24.48 --> 00:08:28.76 want with cross-wits the entotal war.
00:08:28.76 --> 00:08:35.28 But what's crazy is how obvious it is to think about how it helps you achieve the ultimate
00:08:35.28 --> 00:08:38.24 objective, which is winning the war.
00:08:38.24 --> 00:08:46.36 And how much more satisfying that is than just winning a battle, or than losing the war.
00:08:46.36 --> 00:08:53.28 So for whatever it lacks in the excitement of the language of, we're going to destroy every
00:08:53.28 --> 00:08:59.24 single aspect of our enemy down to the ground.
00:08:59.24 --> 00:09:02.88 This actually is the tool that you need to be successful in anything.
00:09:02.88 --> 00:09:03.88 This is how you actually win.
00:09:03.88 --> 00:09:06.60 Is that you win?
00:09:06.60 --> 00:09:17.32 That's very counter-cultural.
00:09:17.32 --> 00:09:19.08 Like you said, it doesn't sell well.
00:09:19.08 --> 00:09:23.24 You can imagine selling well, Jackson standing up and saying, all right, guys, the enemy
00:09:23.24 --> 00:09:25.000 is half mile down there.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.40 We are going to take the fight to them and people get fired up as opposed to saying, hey,
00:09:29.40 --> 00:09:30.92 the enemy is right down there.
00:09:30.92 --> 00:09:35.96 And we're going to walk 14 miles right now to go and hit him for where he doesn't really
00:09:35.96 --> 00:09:44.24 expect it because we don't want to have to face his really, we don't want to have to face
00:09:44.24 --> 00:09:45.24 his strength.
00:09:45.24 --> 00:09:46.24 We're a little scared to do that.
00:09:46.24 --> 00:09:49.40 So we're going to walk around and kind of soccer punch him.
00:09:49.40 --> 00:09:50.40 You guys with me?
00:09:50.40 --> 00:09:51.40 Right?
00:09:51.40 --> 00:09:57.12 It's just like, it's really, as opposed to forward into the breach, right?
00:09:57.12 --> 00:09:58.44 No, not really.
00:09:58.44 --> 00:10:04.20 We're going to sneak around and soccer punch somebody who's with me.
00:10:04.20 --> 00:10:07.20 But it's how you win.
00:10:07.20 --> 00:10:13.000 So let's jump back into it.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.60 Further revision of theory and trying to revise any theory and readjust it for better balance.
00:10:18.60 --> 00:10:20.16 Oh, isn't that interesting?
00:10:20.16 --> 00:10:24.16 We're talking about balance because this is everything is a dichotomy.
00:10:24.16 --> 00:10:29.56 Again, I owe royalties to the LaDale Heart family.
00:10:29.56 --> 00:10:33.40 It is a help to have a background of study in the subject.
00:10:33.40 --> 00:10:38.56 As long as one is willing to modify one's conclusions.
00:10:38.56 --> 00:10:39.68 Not interesting.
00:10:39.68 --> 00:10:43.96 We have to actually be willing to modify our conclusions.
00:10:43.96 --> 00:10:47.40 Change our mind.
00:10:47.40 --> 00:10:48.40 I was.
00:10:48.40 --> 00:10:54.80 So far as I know, the first student of war after 1914 to 1918 to make a re-examination of the
00:10:54.80 --> 00:10:59.44 prevailing doctrines derived from cross-rits about the objective in war.
00:10:59.44 --> 00:11:04.24 We're calling it in question in number of articles in the military journals.
00:11:04.24 --> 00:11:11.32 I was dealt with it more fully in Paris or the future of war 1925.
00:11:11.32 --> 00:11:16.44 This little book began with a criticism of the way that the Orthodox aim, quote, the destruction
00:11:16.44 --> 00:11:21.32 of the enemy's main forces on the battlefield, and quote, had been pursued in World War
00:11:21.32 --> 00:11:27.08 One pointing out its indesisive and exhausting results.
00:11:27.08 --> 00:11:28.40 To your point earlier.
00:11:28.40 --> 00:11:31.72 Hey, we want to go and confront the enemy head on.
00:11:31.72 --> 00:11:32.72 Cool.
00:11:32.72 --> 00:11:39.28 We did that for three years, at four years, and we had not only, we had indesisive and exhausting
00:11:39.28 --> 00:11:40.28 results.
00:11:40.28 --> 00:11:41.28 We were exhausting.
00:11:41.28 --> 00:11:43.28 We didn't get anywhere.
00:11:43.28 --> 00:11:46.32 God, what a freaking sin.
00:11:46.32 --> 00:11:53.40 What a sin to expend all those lives and be exhausted from it and have no real decisive
00:11:53.40 --> 00:11:56.64 victory.
00:11:56.64 --> 00:11:57.64 Continuing.
00:11:57.64 --> 00:12:03.52 I want to argue that the advantages of the moral objective showing how armored forces
00:12:03.52 --> 00:12:07.64 might deliver decisive blow against the Achilles heel of the enemy army, which is the
00:12:07.64 --> 00:12:12.92 communication and command centers, which form its nerve system and two, how air forces
00:12:12.92 --> 00:12:18.28 besides cooperating in this strategic action might also strike with the decisive effect
00:12:18.28 --> 00:12:25.28 direct at a nation's nerve system, and that is its static civil centers of industry.
00:12:25.28 --> 00:12:29.72 So he's the first guy that said, hey, well, we did in World War One sucked and we shouldn't
00:12:29.72 --> 00:12:30.72 do it again.
00:12:30.72 --> 00:12:38.56 How about we use freaking tanks and aircraft to pierce the enemy and cut off their communication
00:12:38.56 --> 00:12:43.60 and ruin their industries?
00:12:43.60 --> 00:12:44.60 Continuing.
00:12:44.60 --> 00:12:48.92 The general staff prescribed the book for the study of the officers of the first experimental
00:12:48.92 --> 00:12:51.68 mechanized force when this was formed two years later.
00:12:51.68 --> 00:12:55.68 The air staff less surprisingly made still fuller use of it.
00:12:55.68 --> 00:13:02.08 There was then a lack of textbooks on air strategy and it fitted the developing trend
00:13:02.08 --> 00:13:04.56 of their views on the subject.
00:13:04.56 --> 00:13:09.92 The chief of staff, the chief of the air staff distributed copies to his fellow chiefs
00:13:09.92 --> 00:13:12.12 of staffs.
00:13:12.12 --> 00:13:17.72 What I have said now is thus a revision after prolonged reflection of what I wrote a
00:13:17.72 --> 00:13:23.20 quarter century ago and an avowl of error over part of the thesis.
00:13:23.20 --> 00:13:27.12 So he's taking ownership of something that he screwed up.
00:13:27.12 --> 00:13:34.64 It shows how in correcting the balance one is apt to tilt too far the other way.
00:13:34.64 --> 00:13:37.04 This is something I call classic team guy over correction.
00:13:37.04 --> 00:13:39.76 I would make a, I'd go and guys would be coming through my training.
00:13:39.76 --> 00:13:40.76 They'd make a mistake.
00:13:40.76 --> 00:13:41.76 Hey, you're micro managing.
00:13:41.76 --> 00:13:45.88 Also, they let people do whatever they want or the opposite.
00:13:45.88 --> 00:13:49.08 Using the balance it one is apt to tilt too far the other way.
00:13:49.08 --> 00:13:53.76 T.E. Lawrence observed in a letter he wrote me in 1928.
00:13:53.76 --> 00:13:54.76 His Lawrence of Arabia.
00:13:54.76 --> 00:14:00.80 This is a guy that found the error, revolt in the Sinai and Palestinian campaign in World
00:14:00.80 --> 00:14:01.80 War.
00:14:01.80 --> 00:14:04.36 One, I mean, this guy is a legendary.
00:14:04.36 --> 00:14:12.000 And Lawrence of Arabia says quote, the logical system of crosswitz is too complete.
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.92 What an opening line.
00:14:13.92 --> 00:14:17.36 A logical system of crosswitz is too complete.
00:14:17.36 --> 00:14:23.36 It leads a stray his disciples, those of them at least, who would rather fight with their
00:14:23.36 --> 00:14:28.24 arms than with their legs.
00:14:28.24 --> 00:14:32.40 What a freaking statement to open up a letter.
00:14:32.40 --> 00:14:35.92 Rather fight with their arms and with their legs.
00:14:35.92 --> 00:14:38.88 What an epic statement.
00:14:38.88 --> 00:14:44.16 It's kind of a kind of a goes in with my discipline.
00:14:44.16 --> 00:14:45.16 He goes free to them fieldmen.
00:14:45.16 --> 00:14:48.04 He'll talk in about, you know, oh, you want to fight?
00:14:48.04 --> 00:14:49.44 You want to know self defense?
00:14:49.44 --> 00:14:50.44 Cool.
00:14:50.44 --> 00:14:51.44 You want to punch me?
00:14:51.44 --> 00:14:52.44 I want to run away.
00:14:52.44 --> 00:14:53.44 You want to kick me, cool.
00:14:53.44 --> 00:14:54.44 I'm going to run away.
00:14:54.44 --> 00:14:59.32 I'm going to fight with my legs, not with my arms.
00:14:59.32 --> 00:15:04.48 Continuing on, you at present are trying with very little help from those whose businesses
00:15:04.48 --> 00:15:09.16 they think upon their profession to put the balance straight after the orgy of the last
00:15:09.16 --> 00:15:11.16 war.
00:15:11.16 --> 00:15:16.68 When you succeed about 1945, these are like little jokes he's making because he's writing
00:15:16.68 --> 00:15:17.88 this in 1928.
00:15:17.88 --> 00:15:24.40 When you succeed about 1945, your sheep will pass your bounds of discretion and have
00:15:24.40 --> 00:15:32.48 to be shivied back to some later strategist, back and forward we go and quote.
00:15:32.48 --> 00:15:40.20 In 1925, I myself went too far and arguing the advantages of the air stroke at civil objectives.
00:15:40.20 --> 00:15:44.52 Though I did qualify this by emphasizing the importance of executing it in such a way
00:15:44.52 --> 00:15:49.76 as to inflict the least possible permanent injury for the enemy of today is the customer
00:15:49.76 --> 00:15:55.76 of the morrow and the ally of the future.
00:15:55.76 --> 00:15:57.40 Who would think that that's possible?
00:15:57.40 --> 00:15:59.72 Who would think that Germany would become our ally?
00:15:59.72 --> 00:16:00.56 Right?
00:16:00.56 --> 00:16:07.24 Who would think that the Japanese would rebuild them to a point of economic power where
00:16:07.24 --> 00:16:10.12 we're in total cooperation with totally?
00:16:10.12 --> 00:16:16.12 My belief then was that a decisive era tack would inflict less total damage in constitute
00:16:16.12 --> 00:16:22.12 less of a drain on the defeated countries recuperative power than a prolonged war of the
00:16:22.12 --> 00:16:23.28 existing type.
00:16:23.28 --> 00:16:26.88 In further study, I came to realize that an era tack on industrial centers was unlikely
00:16:26.88 --> 00:16:32.000 to have an immediate decisive effect and more likely to produce another prolonged war of
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.96 a tritian in fresh form with perhaps less killing but more devastation than from 1918,
00:16:37.96 --> 00:16:41.80 1918, 1914 to 1918.
00:16:41.80 --> 00:16:43.08 World war.
00:16:43.08 --> 00:16:49.48 But when one began to point this out, one soon found that the air staff was far less receptive
00:16:49.48 --> 00:16:52.68 to the revised conclusion than to the original conclusion.
00:16:52.68 --> 00:16:58.36 They continued to cherish faith in a speedy decision and when war experienced compelled them
00:16:58.36 --> 00:17:03.40 to relinquish it, they pinned their faith instead on industrial attrition as fervently
00:17:03.40 --> 00:17:10.24 as the general staff of the last word done to manpower attrition.
00:17:10.24 --> 00:17:12.44 We're not learning lessons.
00:17:12.44 --> 00:17:15.88 God.
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:25.28 Elective egos at play just not learning lessons.
00:17:25.28 --> 00:17:29.32 A lot of this is why, like I said, I've said a couple of times now that this book and
00:17:29.32 --> 00:17:35.96 these strategy is a setup for me for another series of podcasts that I want to do and
00:17:35.96 --> 00:17:41.32 it's all going to come so become so clear.
00:17:41.32 --> 00:17:46.56 Nevertheless, a realization of the drawbacks and evils of taking the civil fabric as the
00:17:46.56 --> 00:17:51.20 objective does not mean the restoration of battle in the own sense of the objective.
00:17:51.20 --> 00:17:56.48 The drawbacks of that cause wouldn't cause witsy in formula where amply shown in World
00:17:56.48 --> 00:17:57.48 War 1.
00:17:57.48 --> 00:18:03.20 In contrast, World War 2 demonstrated the advantage of new potentialities of indirect or
00:18:03.20 --> 00:18:09.84 strategic action against a military objective, amply confirming what had been forecast
00:18:09.84 --> 00:18:15.28 in that respect.
00:18:15.28 --> 00:18:16.84 Is he saying, yeah, I told you so?
00:18:16.84 --> 00:18:17.84 Yes, he is.
00:18:17.84 --> 00:18:19.40 He's saying, I told you so.
00:18:19.40 --> 00:18:25.000 I told you that these things, I told you that this error that this mechanized fast moving
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.72 elements could change the face of war, especially when coupled with air power.
00:18:30.72 --> 00:18:34.48 I told you so.
00:18:34.48 --> 00:18:39.000 Even in the past, such action had been effectively exploited by some of the great captains
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.88 despite the limitations of their instruments, but now with the help of new instruments,
00:18:43.88 --> 00:18:49.60 the airplane, the tank, it proved still more decisive despite the increased strength of
00:18:49.60 --> 00:18:51.64 tactical resistance.
00:18:51.64 --> 00:18:57.48 The new mobility produced a flexibility in varying the direction of thrust and threat which
00:18:57.48 --> 00:19:00.48 disarmed such resistance.
00:19:00.48 --> 00:19:03.32 And that's what we talked about in the last podcast.
00:19:03.32 --> 00:19:08.32 France, Poland, the Balkans, just disarmed resistance.
00:19:08.32 --> 00:19:14.76 The time has come for a fresh revision of the doctrine of the objective or military aim
00:19:14.76 --> 00:19:17.92 and light of recent experience and present conditions.
00:19:17.92 --> 00:19:23.12 It is much to be desired that it should be undertaken on combined service basis to produce
00:19:23.12 --> 00:19:30.24 an agreed solution for there is a dangerous discordance of doctrines at presence.
00:19:30.24 --> 00:19:33.92 The outlines of a revised theory fitted to present conditions and knowledge have emerged.
00:19:33.92 --> 00:19:42.32 I hope in course of this discussion of the subject, the key idea is strategic operation
00:19:42.32 --> 00:19:50.44 rather than battle and old term that has outlived its suitability and utility.
00:19:50.44 --> 00:19:52.88 So get rid of this whole idea of battle.
00:19:52.88 --> 00:19:59.76 Battles may still occur, but should not be regarded as the aim itself to repeat an earlier
00:19:59.76 --> 00:20:04.24 conclusion that was strikingly vindicated in World War II.
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:11.88 The true aim is not so much to seek battle as to seek a strategic situation, so advantageous
00:20:11.88 --> 00:20:16.72 that does not of itself produce the decision that if it does not of itself produce the
00:20:16.72 --> 00:20:21.44 decision, its continuation by a battle is sure to achieve this.
00:20:21.44 --> 00:20:23.52 That's what we're looking for.
00:20:23.52 --> 00:20:27.08 And have your opponent recognize that before the battle takes place.
00:20:27.08 --> 00:20:31.44 So, optimally, yes, optimally they go, you know what, we don't even have a chance.
00:20:31.44 --> 00:20:35.04 If they don't recognize it cool, you're in such a good position that it doesn't matter
00:20:35.04 --> 00:20:37.04 anyways in the battles over very quickly.
00:20:37.04 --> 00:20:38.04 Yeah.
00:20:38.04 --> 00:20:39.64 I mean, I'm writing things down.
00:20:39.64 --> 00:20:43.20 I mean, just the things inside what he just said.
00:20:43.20 --> 00:20:49.48 I've had just the first thing of the common about study is designed to modify conclusions.
00:20:49.48 --> 00:20:54.76 Not to validate your conclusion, like I'm going to go to research and I'm going to literally
00:20:54.76 --> 00:20:59.52 just overlook and bypass anything that doesn't align with what I already think I know.
00:20:59.52 --> 00:21:01.52 I'm just like, that's not convenient.
00:21:01.52 --> 00:21:02.52 So I'm going to skip that.
00:21:02.52 --> 00:21:06.04 So I'm going to find, I'm going to study so I can find information to reinforce what I already
00:21:06.04 --> 00:21:07.04 know.
00:21:07.04 --> 00:21:11.80 He's like, no, I'm doing the study to figure out what I thought that's actually wrong.
00:21:11.80 --> 00:21:19.68 To modify my conclusions, the inherent humility in that approach, I'm going to study
00:21:19.68 --> 00:21:23.80 to find out where I'm wrong.
00:21:23.80 --> 00:21:26.36 I'll hard that actually is to do.
00:21:26.36 --> 00:21:29.76 And then he used the airsap, this example, and of course, you know, the airsap is a thing
00:21:29.76 --> 00:21:30.76 that didn't even exist.
00:21:30.76 --> 00:21:34.84 And now it's this thing where the counter culture there, they're the opposing view of,
00:21:34.84 --> 00:21:37.000 hey, we need to look at these things differently.
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.16 And then how quickly, how quickly they solidified around their new approach and became the
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:48.44 inflexible rigid, we are going to stick to these conclusions.
00:21:48.44 --> 00:21:53.000 We're going to state of these, we are not going to change our viewpoint of this.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.48 And how quickly that process happens to.
00:21:57.48 --> 00:21:59.48 Human beings do not change.
00:21:59.48 --> 00:22:00.48 No.
00:22:00.48 --> 00:22:01.48 They really don't.
00:22:01.48 --> 00:22:04.92 And they really like to dig into whatever they got a hold of.
00:22:04.92 --> 00:22:07.12 What didn't got a hold of something they hang onto it totally.
00:22:07.12 --> 00:22:14.32 It's like trying to pry a little freaking kid, a three year old with a rattle.
00:22:14.32 --> 00:22:15.32 You know what I'm saying?
00:22:15.32 --> 00:22:16.32 They got that rattle.
00:22:16.32 --> 00:22:18.76 Go and try and take that away from them.
00:22:18.76 --> 00:22:20.16 Why is that?
00:22:20.16 --> 00:22:23.000 It's a human instinct to hang onto what you've got.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.64 And you see the general staff after 32 years of military service in 150 years of combined
00:22:29.64 --> 00:22:33.12 military service between these three four generals.
00:22:33.12 --> 00:22:37.04 And they have that new rattle that they got a hold of.
00:22:37.04 --> 00:22:39.32 And they won't let go of it.
00:22:39.32 --> 00:22:40.48 Yeah.
00:22:40.48 --> 00:22:42.32 And they're going to kick and scream.
00:22:42.32 --> 00:22:44.32 It's disturbing.
00:22:44.32 --> 00:22:45.32 It's crazy.
00:22:45.32 --> 00:22:49.08 And he said something to that that he's referenced.
00:22:49.08 --> 00:22:50.52 You've already said it.
00:22:50.52 --> 00:22:55.88 And this one kind of finally stuck is he's making the connection to leadership.
00:22:55.88 --> 00:22:58.08 He's not talking about Klaus Wood so much.
00:22:58.08 --> 00:23:01.72 He keeps saying about his students, his disciples.
00:23:01.72 --> 00:23:05.68 The influence he had on a generation of leaders.
00:23:05.68 --> 00:23:14.44 And the tragedy that was created by that based on Klaus Wood's influence over people.
00:23:14.44 --> 00:23:18.84 And he's made the illusion too like that really wasn't his intent.
00:23:18.84 --> 00:23:19.84 He definitely last podcast.
00:23:19.84 --> 00:23:22.84 He definitely pointed out that that was not his intent.
00:23:22.84 --> 00:23:23.84 Totally.
00:23:23.84 --> 00:23:28.64 But the power for better for worse the power of that leadership.
00:23:28.64 --> 00:23:32.04 And if you have disciples and you've said this over and over again.
00:23:32.04 --> 00:23:40.32 And again, I don't remember the exact quote, but the uneducated disciples are more dangerous
00:23:40.32 --> 00:23:42.44 than the enemy.
00:23:42.44 --> 00:23:50.12 And to just blindly follow the language or the words of the leader and just try to go implement
00:23:50.12 --> 00:23:53.44 them without truly understanding the context.
00:23:53.44 --> 00:23:58.64 And then the evolving application of that to the world that they're going to be in.
00:23:58.64 --> 00:24:02.68 It's, I put the front, from those two pages, just pointing out those things.
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:05.000 How critical those things are.
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.84 Can you fathom the freaking group think that's going on?
00:24:10.84 --> 00:24:11.84 Check it out.
00:24:11.84 --> 00:24:18.96 Not only is everyone on my side bought into this bullshit.
00:24:18.96 --> 00:24:28.20 So my entire freaking army of millions of people is all bought into this idea and your
00:24:28.20 --> 00:24:33.04 side and your millions of soldiers and leaders are all bought to the same idea.
00:24:33.04 --> 00:24:35.28 Imagine how crazy that is.
00:24:35.28 --> 00:24:41.36 Imagine how crazy it is that our group think is so strong that both opposing sides both
00:24:41.36 --> 00:24:49.76 are bought into the same group think at the peril of millions of soldiers.
00:24:49.76 --> 00:24:54.56 Like that's not to think how strong that group think is to think I'm looking at you and
00:24:54.56 --> 00:24:58.56 you're doing the exact same thing as me and I'm thinking well, we're just going to keep
00:24:58.56 --> 00:25:01.60 doing it and you're looking at me thinking we're going to keep doing it and neither one
00:25:01.60 --> 00:25:03.92 of us is able to say you know what this doesn't make any sense.
00:25:03.92 --> 00:25:06.28 Hey, are you looking at what our enemy is doing?
00:25:06.28 --> 00:25:08.72 This is, this seems kind of dumb.
00:25:08.72 --> 00:25:13.76 The power of the group think there, the power of, you know, we always talk about right,
00:25:13.76 --> 00:25:17.40 you got to detach and you got to take a more strategic view.
00:25:17.40 --> 00:25:24.40 These are the freaking generals on both sides at the same time.
00:25:24.40 --> 00:25:30.000 At the same time wrapped up in the identical group think when they are getting a daily
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:38.68 dose of reality, the most stark reality that human beings have ever seen.
00:25:38.68 --> 00:25:46.24 They're getting slapped in the face with that on the daily basis and they never look
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:49.76 around and say hey you know what, this is freaking stupid.
00:25:49.76 --> 00:25:51.96 What are we doing?
00:25:51.96 --> 00:25:56.72 This is the sickest group think, fathomable.
00:25:56.72 --> 00:26:00.20 It's crazy.
00:26:00.20 --> 00:26:02.12 So it's detach.
00:26:02.12 --> 00:26:07.68 It's detach but like detaching to the strategic levels, not enough.
00:26:07.68 --> 00:26:13.20 If you're surrounded, if you're completely surrounded, if you're in the virtual reality
00:26:13.20 --> 00:26:17.08 goggles on, no matter where you look, it's like you're in the game.
00:26:17.08 --> 00:26:20.84 You need to take those things off your head.
00:26:20.84 --> 00:26:29.20 Alright, this is the last chapter that we're going to cover in this book.
00:26:29.20 --> 00:26:34.04 It's called Grand Strategy.
00:26:34.04 --> 00:26:36.000 It's going to tie into a lot of things.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.96 This book is concerned with strategy rather than with Grand Strategy or war policy.
00:26:39.96 --> 00:26:45.40 To deal adequately with this wider subject would require not only a much larger volume
00:26:45.40 --> 00:26:47.32 but a separate volume.
00:26:47.32 --> 00:26:53.52 For while Grand Strategy should control strategy, it's principles often run counter to those
00:26:53.52 --> 00:26:58.88 which prevail in the field of strategy.
00:26:58.88 --> 00:27:03.16 For that very reason, however, it is desirable to include here some indication of the
00:27:03.16 --> 00:27:10.44 deeper conclusions to which a study of Grand Strategy leads.
00:27:10.44 --> 00:27:14.08 The object in war, so this is an interesting setup.
00:27:14.08 --> 00:27:20.96 The setup is, hey, what I've been talking about at this strategic level, we're actually
00:27:20.96 --> 00:27:24.88 actually going to have some principles that are countered to that when we go up one more
00:27:24.88 --> 00:27:25.88 level.
00:27:25.88 --> 00:27:29.88 So this is a very interesting setup.
00:27:29.88 --> 00:27:35.72 The object in war is to attain a better piece, even if only from your own point of view.
00:27:35.72 --> 00:27:41.88 Hence it is essential to conduct war with constant regard to the piece you desire.
00:27:41.88 --> 00:27:45.72 That would appear to be common sense.
00:27:45.72 --> 00:27:48.52 What are we trying to get done?
00:27:48.52 --> 00:27:50.88 How can we get it done?
00:27:50.88 --> 00:27:56.24 Not just to win right now, but how can we set ourselves up in the grand future so that we're
00:27:56.24 --> 00:27:58.88 doing what we want to, so in this situation we want to be in.
00:27:58.88 --> 00:28:06.72 This is the underlying cloud switch definition of war as a, quote, continuation of fallacy
00:28:06.72 --> 00:28:12.40 by other means and quote, the prolongation of that policy through the war into the subsequent
00:28:12.40 --> 00:28:15.28 priests must always be born in mind.
00:28:15.28 --> 00:28:18.32 So you always have to think about the future.
00:28:18.32 --> 00:28:23.36 You always have to think about the future.
00:28:23.36 --> 00:28:25.16 You have to think strategically over time.
00:28:25.16 --> 00:28:32.64 All at all times a state which expands its strength to the point of exhaustion bankrupts
00:28:32.64 --> 00:28:35.16 its own policy and future.
00:28:35.16 --> 00:28:37.20 Again, what's the ROI?
00:28:37.20 --> 00:28:40.12 What's the ROI and what we're doing?
00:28:40.12 --> 00:28:44.84 We are spending all of our capital to make something happen and we look up and cool.
00:28:44.84 --> 00:28:47.04 We made it happen, but we have no capital left.
00:28:47.04 --> 00:28:48.24 We can't pay our employees.
00:28:48.24 --> 00:28:52.36 We can't order anymore of our supplies.
00:28:52.36 --> 00:28:54.28 Good job.
00:28:54.28 --> 00:28:56.80 No, not a good job.
00:28:56.80 --> 00:29:01.68 If you concentrate exclusively on victory with no thought for the after effect, you may
00:29:01.68 --> 00:29:07.24 be too exhausted to profit by the peace while it is almost certain that the peace will
00:29:07.24 --> 00:29:11.48 be a bad one containing the germs of another war.
00:29:11.48 --> 00:29:18.60 This is a lesson supported by abundant experience.
00:29:18.60 --> 00:29:22.80 I brought up this quote again, one of the previous podcasts about, hey, cool, you want to
00:29:22.80 --> 00:29:25.16 now you're in charge of a wasteland.
00:29:25.16 --> 00:29:27.12 How about a leadership capital perspective?
00:29:27.12 --> 00:29:28.12 Cool.
00:29:28.12 --> 00:29:32.000 I got Dave to do what I told him to do and now he hates working here and he's not going
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.80 to do a good job and he's putting his resume out there to everybody else.
00:29:35.80 --> 00:29:36.80 Good job.
00:29:36.80 --> 00:29:40.72 Cool, but I got him to do what I wanted to do.
00:29:40.72 --> 00:29:47.52 I won, but he's got the germs of another war.
00:29:47.52 --> 00:29:50.56 And by the way, go look at what happened between World War 1 and World War 2.
00:29:50.56 --> 00:29:51.56 Yeah.
00:29:51.56 --> 00:29:52.56 Exactly what it is.
00:29:52.56 --> 00:29:59.40 It's referring to, let me just, other examples, but that's a freaking perfect one.
00:29:59.40 --> 00:30:03.72 No one was happy at the end of that war.
00:30:03.72 --> 00:30:09.36 The risks become greater still in any war that is waged by a coalition.
00:30:09.36 --> 00:30:15.20 For in such a case, a two complete victory inevitably complicates the problem of making
00:30:15.20 --> 00:30:19.24 a Justin Wise peace settlement where there is no longer a counterbalance of an opposing
00:30:19.24 --> 00:30:23.44 force to control the appetite to the victors, there is no check on the conflicting views
00:30:23.44 --> 00:30:27.68 and interests between party Z. Alliance, what a brilliant statement, right?
00:30:27.68 --> 00:30:33.32 This is 19, I guess he's one, this is, so this is after World War 2.
00:30:33.32 --> 00:30:34.32 Yeah, absolutely.
00:30:34.32 --> 00:30:38.76 It has to be, I mean, that reference to American Russia like that.
00:30:38.76 --> 00:30:39.76 Yep, cool.
00:30:39.76 --> 00:30:40.76 Yep.
00:30:40.76 --> 00:30:41.76 We work together.
00:30:41.76 --> 00:30:47.28 And as soon as we don't have our common enemy anymore, now we're pissed at each other.
00:30:47.28 --> 00:30:53.16 The divergences then apt to come so acute as to turn the comradeship of common danger
00:30:53.16 --> 00:30:55.64 into the hostility of mutual dissatisfaction.
00:30:55.64 --> 00:30:59.24 So the ally of one war becomes the enemy in the next, there you go.
00:30:59.24 --> 00:31:01.000 Hello, sovia Union.
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.16 Yeah.
00:31:02.16 --> 00:31:03.32 Versus America.
00:31:03.32 --> 00:31:07.28 This raises a further and wider question.
00:31:07.28 --> 00:31:12.76 The friction that commonly develops in any alliance system, especially when it has no balancing
00:31:12.76 --> 00:31:17.48 force has been one of the factors that have fostered numerous attempts throughout fist
00:31:17.48 --> 00:31:21.08 history to find solution infusion.
00:31:21.08 --> 00:31:25.80 So joining together, this is like an opulatoon.
00:31:25.80 --> 00:31:27.88 You have a platoon.
00:31:27.88 --> 00:31:30.96 If you leave them alone for a little while, they'll start fighting each other.
00:31:30.96 --> 00:31:34.32 That's just what's going to happen.
00:31:34.32 --> 00:31:36.68 There's no balancing forces, no one to go against.
00:31:36.68 --> 00:31:38.36 Even if it's this, the training cadre.
00:31:38.36 --> 00:31:41.80 That's enough of a, you know, we'll go against those guys, our another platoon.
00:31:41.80 --> 00:31:45.92 Once they're alone, they're going to start fighting each other.
00:31:45.92 --> 00:31:50.76 So we look for solutions infusion, but history teaches us that in practice, this is apt
00:31:50.76 --> 00:31:54.28 to mean domination by one of the constituent elements.
00:31:54.28 --> 00:31:57.84 And although there is a natural tendency toward the fusion of small groups and a larger
00:31:57.84 --> 00:32:02.84 ones, the usual result of forcing the pace is the confusion of the plans to establish
00:32:02.84 --> 00:32:05.24 a comprehensive political unit.
00:32:05.24 --> 00:32:06.24 Kind of it.
00:32:06.24 --> 00:32:08.36 I will say that's a pretty pessimistic view.
00:32:08.36 --> 00:32:12.16 It's a realistic view, but it's a pessimistic view.
00:32:12.16 --> 00:32:16.000 More over regrettable as it may seem to the idealist, the experience of history provides
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.68 little warmth for the belief that real progress and the freedom that makes progress possible
00:32:20.68 --> 00:32:21.68 wise and unification.
00:32:21.68 --> 00:32:24.20 And this is something we need to pay attention to.
00:32:24.20 --> 00:32:29.68 For where unification has been able to establish unity of ideas, it has usually ended
00:32:29.68 --> 00:32:35.000 in uniformity, paralyzing the growth of new ideas.
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.76 And where unification has merely brought about an artificial or imposed unity, it is
00:32:39.76 --> 00:32:41.88 Erksom.
00:32:41.88 --> 00:32:45.88 It's Erksomness has led through discord to disruption.
00:32:45.88 --> 00:32:50.44 I love that from a leadership perspective.
00:32:50.44 --> 00:32:52.12 We get everyone on board with a plan.
00:32:52.12 --> 00:32:53.48 Hey, listen, everyone just lock it up.
00:32:53.48 --> 00:32:55.52 We're going with my plan.
00:32:55.52 --> 00:32:57.80 It seems to help, right?
00:32:57.80 --> 00:33:00.80 It seems to help, but by the way, no one's now thinking.
00:33:00.80 --> 00:33:02.76 And on top of that, people are pissed.
00:33:02.76 --> 00:33:04.000 Discord.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.04 So now as soon as something goes wrong, we got an element that's breaking off.
00:33:08.04 --> 00:33:10.08 You got people complaining.
00:33:10.08 --> 00:33:11.08 Why is that?
00:33:11.08 --> 00:33:14.08 We're trying to force uniformity.
00:33:14.08 --> 00:33:17.40 We're trying to force people to think the same way.
00:33:17.40 --> 00:33:20.000 It's a problem.
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.28 Vitality springs from diversity, which makes for real progress so long as there is mutual
00:33:25.28 --> 00:33:28.44 toleration.
00:33:28.44 --> 00:33:32.48 Based on the recognition that worse may come from an attempt to suppress differences
00:33:32.48 --> 00:33:35.24 than from acceptance of them.
00:33:35.24 --> 00:33:39.16 Again, if you're in a leader and you got someone that's a little outside the lines
00:33:39.16 --> 00:33:45.84 and all you do is beat them into submission, it's not helping.
00:33:45.84 --> 00:33:50.08 For this reason, the kind of piece that makes progress possible is best assured by the mutual
00:33:50.08 --> 00:33:56.24 checks created by a balance of forces alike in the sphere of internal politics and of
00:33:56.24 --> 00:34:00.16 international relations.
00:34:00.16 --> 00:34:10.04 So he goes into a little bit about the balance of power and politics.
00:34:10.04 --> 00:34:16.04 He says any monopoly of power leads to ever repeated demonstrations of the historical truth,
00:34:16.04 --> 00:34:20.60 epitomized and Lord Acton's famous dictum all power corrupts and absolute power corrupts
00:34:20.60 --> 00:34:25.60 absolutely.
00:34:25.60 --> 00:34:29.24 Another conclusion which develops from the study of Grand Strategy against the background
00:34:29.24 --> 00:34:33.88 of history is the practical necessity of adapting the general theory of strategy to the
00:34:33.88 --> 00:34:37.16 nature of a nation's fundamental policy.
00:34:37.16 --> 00:34:39.24 God, make sure you're aligned.
00:34:39.24 --> 00:34:43.80 God, make sure you're aligned.
00:34:43.80 --> 00:34:51.16 Goes into the difference between an acquisition of state and a conservative state, meaning
00:34:51.16 --> 00:34:56.04 hey, my state is going out to acquire other properties that we're going to go on the attack
00:34:56.04 --> 00:35:00.96 and a conservative state, which is hey, we're just trying to maintain what we've got.
00:35:00.96 --> 00:35:08.16 The Equisitive State inherently unsatisfied needs to gain victory in order to gain its
00:35:08.16 --> 00:35:12.12 object and must therefore court greater risks in the attempt.
00:35:12.12 --> 00:35:17.44 The conservative state can achieve its object by merely inducing the aggressor to drop his
00:35:17.44 --> 00:35:23.44 attempt at conquest by convincing him that the game is not worth the candle.
00:35:23.44 --> 00:35:28.68 In victory, its victory isn't a real sense attained by foiling one's bid.
00:35:28.68 --> 00:35:33.80 One side's, look, by foiling the other side's bid for victory.
00:35:33.80 --> 00:35:40.28 Indeed, in attempting more, it may defeat its own purpose by exhausting itself so much
00:35:40.28 --> 00:35:47.20 that it's unable to resist other enemies or the internal effects of overstrain.
00:35:47.20 --> 00:35:54.20 If exhaustion in war has killed more states than any foreign assailants and how often do
00:35:54.20 --> 00:35:56.44 we see that in companies?
00:35:56.44 --> 00:36:02.32 How often do we see in companies where they are just going so hard and investing in so
00:36:02.32 --> 00:36:08.36 many different places and chewing up their teams?
00:36:08.36 --> 00:36:17.20 We have to be cognizant of that.
00:36:17.20 --> 00:36:19.92 Waving these factors, the problem that can be seen that the problem of a conservative
00:36:19.92 --> 00:36:24.44 state is to find the type of strategy that is suited to fulfill its inherently more limited
00:36:24.44 --> 00:36:31.12 object in the most strengthened, serving way so as to ensure future as well as presence.
00:36:31.12 --> 00:36:35.04 Now, there's a reason I'm covering this part because of this statement.
00:36:35.04 --> 00:36:41.56 At first glance, it might seem that pure defense would be the most economical method.
00:36:41.56 --> 00:36:49.16 But this implies static defense and historical experience warns us that it is dangerously
00:36:49.16 --> 00:36:52.08 brittle method on which to rely.
00:36:52.08 --> 00:36:57.68 Economy of force and deterrent affect our best combined in defensive offensive method
00:36:57.68 --> 00:37:06.40 based on high mobility that carries the power of a quick repost.
00:37:06.40 --> 00:37:09.92 And a quick repost is a move in fencing.
00:37:09.92 --> 00:37:13.52 It's a thrust in fencing.
00:37:13.52 --> 00:37:15.28 So it's cool to think, you know what?
00:37:15.28 --> 00:37:16.28 We're just going to conserve.
00:37:16.28 --> 00:37:17.28 We're going to stay here.
00:37:17.28 --> 00:37:18.12 We're going to be on the defensive.
00:37:18.12 --> 00:37:20.44 But we have to remember that historically speaking.
00:37:20.44 --> 00:37:26.16 And when he's talking about historically speaking, he's talking about a massive swath of history
00:37:26.16 --> 00:37:31.96 that he's looked at to confirm that you've got to have some offense.
00:37:31.96 --> 00:37:34.52 You've got to be on offense.
00:37:34.52 --> 00:37:35.52 And we say this a lot.
00:37:35.52 --> 00:37:42.32 Like if you're not growing, you're losing totally.
00:37:42.32 --> 00:37:50.16 He's also clearly learned the lesson that he's kind of accused of not applying, which
00:37:50.16 --> 00:37:58.60 is the context to the statements where you say, hey, the conservative approach and
00:37:58.60 --> 00:38:05.40 all by the way, if you're over there thinking that I'm telling you dig in and be conservative,
00:38:05.40 --> 00:38:07.20 that's not what I'm saying.
00:38:07.20 --> 00:38:13.76 And to clarify and have the understanding of the common itself, so the comment or the headline
00:38:13.76 --> 00:38:19.48 doesn't become the story, which he referenced so many times of, hey, the statement became
00:38:19.48 --> 00:38:25.68 its own interpretation, the same became its own truth when it's not really what he meant.
00:38:25.68 --> 00:38:30.04 But he didn't actually take the time to make sure his disciples, his learners understood,
00:38:30.04 --> 00:38:31.84 I'm not saying dig in.
00:38:31.84 --> 00:38:33.32 I'm not saying that.
00:38:33.32 --> 00:38:36.96 And I know if you're hearing that, let me be more clear what this approach really
00:38:36.96 --> 00:38:37.96 means.
00:38:37.96 --> 00:38:40.72 And that's clearly a lesson he's taken from.
00:38:40.72 --> 00:38:44.12 The other leaders that didn't do that and the outcomes of that creates when you don't
00:38:44.12 --> 00:38:45.12 actually explain what you mean.
00:38:45.12 --> 00:38:50.40 We talked about almost as a joke inside of your, don't care, or you know, hold the line.
00:38:50.40 --> 00:38:53.88 And if you're hearing, I hold the line on all things.
00:38:53.88 --> 00:38:54.88 Let me be more clear.
00:38:54.88 --> 00:38:55.88 That's not what I'm saying.
00:38:55.88 --> 00:38:58.48 I'm saying this, this, and this, and this, and this, and how you apply this.
00:38:58.48 --> 00:39:02.76 So I really like the idea that he's taking the comment and then giving the context around
00:39:02.76 --> 00:39:04.72 us people can understand what he's talking about.
00:39:04.72 --> 00:39:07.32 The people that are actually studying what he's saying.
00:39:07.32 --> 00:39:16.28 The idea of the dichotomy of leadership, that idea came to me because I was working with
00:39:16.28 --> 00:39:18.52 these young junior officers.
00:39:18.52 --> 00:39:19.80 And you know what they want to do?
00:39:19.80 --> 00:39:21.80 They want to do good.
00:39:21.80 --> 00:39:23.92 They want to do good.
00:39:23.92 --> 00:39:29.40 So if you tell them to be aggressive, cool, got it.
00:39:29.40 --> 00:39:32.52 They are on freaking level 14, berserk remote.
00:39:32.52 --> 00:39:35.08 They're charging into whatever.
00:39:35.08 --> 00:39:41.96 You tell them not to move.
00:39:41.96 --> 00:39:45.60 You tell them, hey, make sure you take the high ground.
00:39:45.60 --> 00:39:47.52 Cool, guess what they're doing.
00:39:47.52 --> 00:39:51.60 They're running to the top of every freaking hill that they see.
00:39:51.60 --> 00:39:52.60 Yeah.
00:39:52.60 --> 00:39:56.92 So, so anything that I would tell them, there was a, there was, they had a proclivity
00:39:56.92 --> 00:39:59.28 to take it to the extreme.
00:39:59.28 --> 00:40:06.48 And so within like one or two iterations at our land warfare training facility, I was
00:40:06.48 --> 00:40:09.04 like, okay, I got to tell these guys that there has to be balance.
00:40:09.04 --> 00:40:10.88 That everything that I'm saying has to be balanced.
00:40:10.88 --> 00:40:12.48 Every single thing that I'm saying has to be balanced.
00:40:12.48 --> 00:40:15.04 If you take anything that I'm saying and you take it to an extreme, it's going to be
00:40:15.04 --> 00:40:19.000 bad.
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.40 So I tried to do the same thing.
00:40:22.40 --> 00:40:28.88 It's kind of a universal, I mean, I hate to say it's like a cop out.
00:40:28.88 --> 00:40:32.56 You know, because it's like, you know, if your ego's, you're saying ego's no good.
00:40:32.56 --> 00:40:34.04 No, actually, it's a balance, right?
00:40:34.04 --> 00:40:35.48 And it kind of sounds like a cop out.
00:40:35.48 --> 00:40:36.80 Does it sound like a little bit of a cop out?
00:40:36.80 --> 00:40:38.16 Echo channels, you seem to agree with me.
00:40:38.16 --> 00:40:42.08 Yeah, I mean, it can, yeah, but no.
00:40:42.08 --> 00:40:43.08 Yes, but no.
00:40:43.08 --> 00:40:47.64 I mean, it's a real bummer, I think, not a bummer, but someone will say, well, you're
00:40:47.64 --> 00:40:53.88 saying that, you know, you're saying that the ego is bad, but the ego's, the ego's, you
00:40:53.88 --> 00:40:56.64 know, I don't want to hire people that bunch of pushovers.
00:40:56.64 --> 00:40:57.64 Yeah.
00:40:57.64 --> 00:41:02.64 Yeah, I know man, that's the dichotomy and they're kind of like, oh, they're like,
00:41:02.64 --> 00:41:05.08 they think I don't have that, they forget that I have that.
00:41:05.08 --> 00:41:09.48 You know, and it's why I feel like bad sometimes pulling the dichotomy card, but it's the
00:41:09.48 --> 00:41:10.48 truth.
00:41:10.48 --> 00:41:11.48 Yeah.
00:41:11.48 --> 00:41:14.20 The truth is, man, you take something to the extreme and it's bad.
00:41:14.20 --> 00:41:15.20 Yeah.
00:41:15.20 --> 00:41:17.20 That's the truth.
00:41:17.20 --> 00:41:18.56 You still don't like it?
00:41:18.56 --> 00:41:24.08 No, I agree with you where it's like, you know that it's not a cop out.
00:41:24.08 --> 00:41:29.08 In fact, it's the opposite of a cop out.
00:41:29.08 --> 00:41:30.08 Yeah.
00:41:30.08 --> 00:41:31.08 It's just more to it than that.
00:41:31.08 --> 00:41:35.92 In fact, when someone doesn't recognize the dichotomy, that might be the more of the
00:41:35.92 --> 00:41:36.92 cop out.
00:41:36.92 --> 00:41:38.92 It's kind of like, oh, you say go here, oh, I went there.
00:41:38.92 --> 00:41:39.92 I went there.
00:41:39.92 --> 00:41:40.92 That's what you said, right?
00:41:40.92 --> 00:41:42.92 It's like, right, you got to start using your judgment a little bit.
00:41:42.92 --> 00:41:43.92 You know?
00:41:43.92 --> 00:41:44.92 Yep.
00:41:44.92 --> 00:41:50.92 You were talking about, does it sound like a cop out?
00:41:50.92 --> 00:41:55.56 And in the scenarios of top-gun, you know, everything is like a scenario.
00:41:55.56 --> 00:41:56.96 What do I do in this situation?
00:41:56.96 --> 00:41:57.96 How do I react?
00:41:57.96 --> 00:42:03.76 And like the classic answer, the classic answer was always, it depends.
00:42:03.76 --> 00:42:06.28 Which had this feeling of like, it's a cop out.
00:42:06.28 --> 00:42:09.56 It's a cop out and like, oh, you don't really know or you don't have to be definitive
00:42:09.56 --> 00:42:13.04 because at their times when people want a black and white, they want a black and white
00:42:13.04 --> 00:42:14.04 answer.
00:42:14.04 --> 00:42:15.44 If I have this situation, what do I do?
00:42:15.44 --> 00:42:16.44 It depends.
00:42:16.44 --> 00:42:17.84 Well, it actually depends.
00:42:17.84 --> 00:42:21.96 But it actually does depend.
00:42:21.96 --> 00:42:22.96 It's not a cop out.
00:42:22.96 --> 00:42:23.96 It does.
00:42:23.96 --> 00:42:30.32 Because it's not satisfying and it requires like contemplation and understanding of the
00:42:30.32 --> 00:42:32.80 nuance and how did I get here in the first place?
00:42:32.80 --> 00:42:34.76 What am I trying to accomplish?
00:42:34.76 --> 00:42:41.04 So I was just thinking to myself when you were talking about this feeling of it sounds
00:42:41.04 --> 00:42:45.92 like a cop out was the answer I gave 5000 times a top-gun to the students.
00:42:45.92 --> 00:42:46.92 It depends.
00:42:46.92 --> 00:42:50.000 And then you got a digging and go through it and go, well actually in the case that you're
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.68 describing, this might actually be a better answer than in the same situation but driven
00:42:54.68 --> 00:42:59.24 by another goal or got there for a different reason, hey, I might go a different direction
00:42:59.24 --> 00:43:00.24 here.
00:43:00.24 --> 00:43:04.08 And then you as a leader have to actually apply some judgment in real time as opposed to this
00:43:04.08 --> 00:43:05.64 situation requires this response.
00:43:05.64 --> 00:43:07.08 Well, it's not that simple.
00:43:07.08 --> 00:43:08.08 Hey, a salty leader.
00:43:08.08 --> 00:43:11.000 What are you doing way back there when they're all bogged down up in the front?
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000 Yeah.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.96 Well, you told me not to get engaged in like the room room clearance.
00:43:14.96 --> 00:43:15.96 Totally.
00:43:15.96 --> 00:43:16.96 But they're bogged down.
00:43:16.96 --> 00:43:17.96 Yeah.
00:43:17.96 --> 00:43:22.16 That you're example of where should the platoon commander be in a patrol?
00:43:22.16 --> 00:43:23.16 It depends.
00:43:23.16 --> 00:43:24.16 Yeah, where it makes sense.
00:43:24.16 --> 00:43:25.16 Totally.
00:43:25.16 --> 00:43:26.16 Could be in the front?
00:43:26.16 --> 00:43:27.16 Could be in the back?
00:43:27.16 --> 00:43:29.16 Could be in the middle?
00:43:29.16 --> 00:43:30.16 No.
00:43:30.16 --> 00:43:31.48 And I guess we've hit this.
00:43:31.48 --> 00:43:36.72 I'm probably beating at dead horse a little bit but the unsatisfying nature of that answer
00:43:36.72 --> 00:43:39.72 when I got to the basic school.
00:43:39.72 --> 00:43:42.96 I'm a brand new second lieutenant.
00:43:42.96 --> 00:43:48.32 And we get to the the the the basic school and right outside of the main headquarters building
00:43:48.32 --> 00:43:52.80 is this giant bronze statue of the lieutenant.
00:43:52.80 --> 00:43:53.80 And he's in this post.
00:43:53.80 --> 00:43:54.80 He's got his rifle.
00:43:54.80 --> 00:43:57.52 His porno's arm up and it says follow me.
00:43:57.52 --> 00:44:00.72 You know, which is what they push you.
00:44:00.72 --> 00:44:02.48 He's lead from the front.
00:44:02.48 --> 00:44:04.24 Get out in front of your man.
00:44:04.24 --> 00:44:07.16 And in a lot of ways.
00:44:07.16 --> 00:44:08.16 That's right.
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:09.16 That's right.
00:44:09.16 --> 00:44:10.16 To have that.
00:44:10.16 --> 00:44:13.80 But in a lot of ways, it's actually not right.
00:44:13.80 --> 00:44:23.56 But place yourself where you need to be is nowhere near as cool as cool as follow me.
00:44:23.56 --> 00:44:25.40 Lead from the front.
00:44:25.40 --> 00:44:27.48 But if that's what you hey, I lead from the front like cool.
00:44:27.48 --> 00:44:28.96 You have no idea what's going on back here.
00:44:28.96 --> 00:44:33.76 And half of your guys just got hammered because of that.
00:44:33.76 --> 00:44:39.44 There's this, I think this compulsion, which is why the class would think plays so well
00:44:39.44 --> 00:44:44.92 to the, the, the, even just the catch phrases of leadership, which don't actually serve
00:44:44.92 --> 00:44:46.40 a leader very well.
00:44:46.40 --> 00:44:47.40 Lead from the front.
00:44:47.40 --> 00:44:50.48 Who's going to say like that's a terrible leadership philosophy, but actually sometimes
00:44:50.48 --> 00:44:51.80 you don't want to be in the front.
00:44:51.80 --> 00:44:55.28 Yeah, which is why I have a section in leadership strategy and tactics, which is actually
00:44:55.28 --> 00:44:56.28 called lead from the rear.
00:44:56.28 --> 00:44:57.28 Totally.
00:44:57.28 --> 00:45:05.96 So it kind of like, you have to like the more under because there has to be the formula
00:45:05.96 --> 00:45:07.48 right at some level.
00:45:07.48 --> 00:45:12.64 Like obviously at the, at the surface, the formula is like, or you might, someone might
00:45:12.64 --> 00:45:17.04 make them mistake the formula is lead from the front at all times, right?
00:45:17.04 --> 00:45:18.72 But that's not the formula.
00:45:18.72 --> 00:45:19.72 Formal is it depends.
00:45:19.72 --> 00:45:20.72 Okay, on what?
00:45:20.72 --> 00:45:22.72 And there's a formula under there.
00:45:22.72 --> 00:45:26.76 But then under there, you're like, okay, well, if this and this and this, it depends a
00:45:26.76 --> 00:45:27.76 little bit more.
00:45:27.76 --> 00:45:32.80 And the deeper you go, there has to be some formula, right?
00:45:32.80 --> 00:45:33.80 No.
00:45:33.80 --> 00:45:36.12 Okay, so that and that's what I was going to say too here.
00:45:36.12 --> 00:45:39.20 So the, the, the formula, you know what, I have the formula, you know what the formula
00:45:39.20 --> 00:45:40.20 is?
00:45:40.20 --> 00:45:44.24 It's in that economy or Dave will tell you the formula is, it depends.
00:45:44.24 --> 00:45:45.24 Yeah.
00:45:45.24 --> 00:45:46.24 So I feel like, yeah.
00:45:46.24 --> 00:45:47.24 Yeah.
00:45:47.24 --> 00:45:49.24 So both of those are cop out of answers you don't want to hear them.
00:45:49.24 --> 00:45:50.24 No, no, no, no.
00:45:50.24 --> 00:45:51.36 No, no, I'm actually agreeing with you.
00:45:51.36 --> 00:45:53.36 Like that, that's what I would have said too.
00:45:53.36 --> 00:45:55.92 It's going to always depend.
00:45:55.92 --> 00:45:56.92 Okay.
00:45:56.92 --> 00:46:01.36 So, and also on top of it, there's more than one right answer a lot of the time.
00:46:01.36 --> 00:46:07.64 Pretty much all the time, pretty much with very few exceptions, I would think.
00:46:07.64 --> 00:46:08.64 There are wrong answers.
00:46:08.64 --> 00:46:10.36 Oh, yeah, yeah, I agree with that too.
00:46:10.36 --> 00:46:11.36 Okay.
00:46:11.36 --> 00:46:13.12 But you're saying there's more than one right answer.
00:46:13.12 --> 00:46:14.12 Yeah.
00:46:14.12 --> 00:46:15.12 Many cases, yes.
00:46:15.12 --> 00:46:21.56 So I would say the solution is the more you understand about all of it, the better decision
00:46:21.56 --> 00:46:27.16 you can make and the better, the better educated you will be on what decision to make,
00:46:27.16 --> 00:46:31.60 give in the parameters of all of that that caught on me is your dealing with.
00:46:31.60 --> 00:46:36.28 Except for the fact that you may not have enough information to make the decision that
00:46:36.28 --> 00:46:40.60 seems like it's going to be the perfect decision in which case you kind of screwed up by
00:46:40.60 --> 00:46:44.92 not moving a little bit more quickly and making decision based on the information that you
00:46:44.92 --> 00:46:46.52 had at that current moment.
00:46:46.52 --> 00:46:47.52 Yeah.
00:46:47.52 --> 00:46:53.84 But when I'm in, when I'm in, what I'm in by knowing, like educated yourself, not on any
00:46:53.84 --> 00:46:59.88 specific scenario, I'm saying on how it works, on the dichotomy of leadership, on the
00:46:59.88 --> 00:47:01.16 laws of combat or whatever.
00:47:01.16 --> 00:47:02.16 Okay.
00:47:02.16 --> 00:47:03.16 Yes.
00:47:03.16 --> 00:47:04.16 Understand it.
00:47:04.16 --> 00:47:05.80 Well, yeah, then you're going back to what I said, which is the formula is, this is an
00:47:05.80 --> 00:47:07.000 dichotomy and you got to be balanced.
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000 Yeah.
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000 That's the formula.
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.40 The formula is be balanced.
00:47:10.40 --> 00:47:11.40 Yeah.
00:47:11.40 --> 00:47:15.60 Like some, the more you know about the whole game, we'll say the more you know when you're
00:47:15.60 --> 00:47:19.36 going to be on this side of the dichotomy or leaning on this side of the dichotomy, the more
00:47:19.36 --> 00:47:22.44 you know about yourself, the more you know about it, your guys, building relationships
00:47:22.44 --> 00:47:25.64 and by the way, the more you know about this and the more you know about how this works,
00:47:25.64 --> 00:47:28.92 then you're going to know more about under what types of circumstances you're going to
00:47:28.92 --> 00:47:30.36 lean here, early in the.
00:47:30.36 --> 00:47:32.60 You know what's cool?
00:47:32.60 --> 00:47:34.56 We have a business called echelon front.
00:47:34.56 --> 00:47:35.56 Yes, sir.
00:47:35.56 --> 00:47:40.32 The reason we have a business called echelon front is because we have to help leaders
00:47:40.32 --> 00:47:42.08 work through these issues.
00:47:42.08 --> 00:47:47.84 We can't give them a formula that they can then apply across the board in all situations.
00:47:47.84 --> 00:47:52.24 But like you're saying, correctly, if they learn to understand the principles,
00:47:52.24 --> 00:47:57.52 they can start to make better decisions and write decisions based on their understanding
00:47:57.52 --> 00:48:02.12 of these principles and applying them holistically to their scenario.
00:48:02.12 --> 00:48:03.12 Right.
00:48:03.12 --> 00:48:04.12 Yes, exactly right.
00:48:04.12 --> 00:48:08.56 Which I was going to say, yeah, exactly what I'm saying, where, where do you get the formula
00:48:08.56 --> 00:48:09.56 from?
00:48:09.56 --> 00:48:14.12 Oh, you're probably the most educated on this whole game as far as the game goes, right?
00:48:14.12 --> 00:48:16.92 So the more you let's say you consult with a client, right?
00:48:16.92 --> 00:48:20.28 The more you consult with them, hopefully the more they're going to learn that same
00:48:20.28 --> 00:48:23.16 game and they're going to need you less and less.
00:48:23.16 --> 00:48:24.52 Yes, that's the goal.
00:48:24.52 --> 00:48:25.52 Yes, sir.
00:48:25.52 --> 00:48:26.52 Absolutely.
00:48:26.52 --> 00:48:31.32 All right, back to the book.
00:48:31.32 --> 00:48:41.28 The East Roman Empire was a case where such an actively conservative strategy had
00:48:41.28 --> 00:48:46.28 been carefully found out as a basis of war policy, a fact which goes far to explain
00:48:46.28 --> 00:48:49.40 this empire's unrivaled span of existence.
00:48:49.40 --> 00:48:54.76 Another example more instinctive than reasoned is provided by the strategy based on
00:48:54.76 --> 00:49:00.04 C power that England practiced in her wars from the 16th to the 19th century.
00:49:00.04 --> 00:49:05.08 The value of it was shown by the way that her strength kept pace with her growth while
00:49:05.08 --> 00:49:11.16 all her rivals broke down and turned through self-exhaustion and war traceable to their
00:49:11.16 --> 00:49:19.96 immoderate desire for the immediate satisfaction of outright victory.
00:49:19.96 --> 00:49:26.76 Along series of mutually exhausting and devastating wars above all the 30 years of war
00:49:26.76 --> 00:49:33.16 has brought head-brought statesmen by the 18th century to realize the necessity when engaged in
00:49:33.16 --> 00:49:41.96 war of curbing both their ambitions and their passions in the interests of their purpose.
00:49:41.96 --> 00:49:46.76 On the one hand, this realization tended to produce a tacit limitation of warfare and avoidance
00:49:46.76 --> 00:49:50.12 of excesses which might damage after the war prospect.
00:49:50.12 --> 00:49:52.96 So he's going back in time and say, look, we can't have learned these lessons.
00:49:52.96 --> 00:49:54.12 It was a regression.
00:49:54.12 --> 00:49:58.60 That's why earlier in the last podcast we talked about, he talked about, class which was
00:49:58.60 --> 00:50:00.000 a regression.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.12 We are going backwards.
00:50:02.12 --> 00:50:04.36 Because they had figured this stuff out the 30 years war.
00:50:04.36 --> 00:50:08.92 I mean, that's the 1600s you got Germany and Sweden, Sweden, Spain and Catholics.
00:50:08.92 --> 00:50:10.52 First probably, all kinds are crazy.
00:50:10.52 --> 00:50:13.88 Warfare going on to know to know real decisive victory.
00:50:13.88 --> 00:50:17.16 It's a problem they realize that.
00:50:17.16 --> 00:50:21.16 Their ambitions and passions frequently carry them too far so that the return to peace
00:50:21.16 --> 00:50:25.08 found their countries weakened rather than strengthened.
00:50:25.08 --> 00:50:31.24 But they had learned to stop short of national exhaustion.
00:50:31.24 --> 00:50:38.68 Which again, you take that for leadership capital and we're expanding more than we have.
00:50:38.68 --> 00:50:45.40 At the most satisfactory, at the most satisfactory peace settlements, even for the stronger side,
00:50:45.40 --> 00:50:52.56 proved to be those which were made by negotiation rather than decisive military issue.
00:50:52.56 --> 00:50:57.92 This gradually education in inherent limitations of war was still in process when it was interrupted
00:50:57.92 --> 00:51:04.92 by the French Revolution which brought to the top men who were novices in statemanship.
00:51:04.92 --> 00:51:12.56 The directorie and its successor Napoleon pursued the vision of an enduring peace through
00:51:12.56 --> 00:51:16.36 war after war for 20 years.
00:51:16.36 --> 00:51:17.36 There you go.
00:51:17.36 --> 00:51:20.64 Napoleon going for peace, 20 years of war.
00:51:20.64 --> 00:51:26.36 The pursuit never led to the goal but only to spreading exhaustion and ultimate collapse.
00:51:26.36 --> 00:51:34.24 The bankruptcy of the Napoleonic Empire renewed a lesson that had often been taught before.
00:51:34.24 --> 00:51:38.92 The impression however came to be obscured by the sunset haze of the Napoleonic myth,
00:51:38.92 --> 00:51:44.64 the lesson had been forgotten by the time it was repeated in the war of war 1.
00:51:44.64 --> 00:51:54.72 Even after that bitter experience, the statement of the second world war were no wiser.
00:51:54.72 --> 00:52:00.04 Although war is contrary to reason, since it is a mean of deciding issues by force when
00:52:00.04 --> 00:52:06.16 discussion fails to produce an agreed solution, the conduct of war must be controlled by
00:52:06.16 --> 00:52:10.16 reason if its object is to be fulfilled.
00:52:10.16 --> 00:52:17.20 Here he goes into how we reasonably conduct war.
00:52:17.20 --> 00:52:18.20 1.
00:52:18.20 --> 00:52:23.24 While fighting is a physical act, its direction is a mental process.
00:52:23.24 --> 00:52:27.80 The better your strategy, the easier you will gain the upper hand and the less it will
00:52:27.80 --> 00:52:31.40 cost you.
00:52:31.40 --> 00:52:34.92 Very important thing to think about.
00:52:34.92 --> 00:52:35.92 2.
00:52:35.92 --> 00:52:41.92 Conversely, the more strength you waste, the more you increase the risk of the scales of war
00:52:41.92 --> 00:52:44.000 turning against you.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:54.36 Even if you succeed in winning victory, the less strength you will have to profit by peace.
00:52:54.36 --> 00:52:56.88 Just apply that one to World War 1.
00:52:56.88 --> 00:52:59.44 And its like, okay, we didn't stop this.
00:52:59.44 --> 00:53:00.44 3.
00:53:00.44 --> 00:53:06.64 The more brutal your methods, the more bitter you will make your opponents with the natural
00:53:06.64 --> 00:53:11.44 result of hardening the resistance you are trying to overcome.
00:53:11.44 --> 00:53:16.92 Plus, the more evenly the two sides are matched, the wiser it will be to avoid extremes
00:53:16.92 --> 00:53:23.56 of violence which tend to consolidate the enemies troops and people behind their leaders.
00:53:23.56 --> 00:53:28.28 I mean, okay, war, yeah, what about leadership perspective on that one?
00:53:28.28 --> 00:53:33.52 No, like the more brutal, the more you shut up they even do and I told you to do.
00:53:33.52 --> 00:53:34.88 Shut up team, this is what we're doing.
00:53:34.88 --> 00:53:41.40 The more you do that, the more resistance you're going to have to overcome.
00:53:41.40 --> 00:53:42.40 4.
00:53:42.40 --> 00:53:46.84 These calculations extend further.
00:53:46.84 --> 00:53:56.76 The more intent you appear to impose a peace entirely of your own choosing by conquest
00:53:56.76 --> 00:54:03.04 the stiffer, the obstacle you will raise in your path.
00:54:03.04 --> 00:54:08.44 So when I make a peace that's completely, you know, in my favor, cool, I'm going to end
00:54:08.44 --> 00:54:09.76 up with problems.
00:54:09.76 --> 00:54:13.96 And the more I impose a plan on Dave and his team, the more I'm going to end up with
00:54:13.96 --> 00:54:17.92 problems.
00:54:17.92 --> 00:54:24.68 And I can see the looks on the people's faces in a company when I tell them that.
00:54:24.68 --> 00:54:26.68 It's so hard to believe.
00:54:26.68 --> 00:54:29.52 It's so hard to believe that, hey, actually the more efficient way is to say, hey, Dave,
00:54:29.52 --> 00:54:31.76 how do you want to do this?
00:54:31.76 --> 00:54:35.32 It's so hard to believe that.
00:54:35.32 --> 00:54:37.96 It seems so much more efficient for me to say, hey, Dave, here's the plan.
00:54:37.96 --> 00:54:39.52 Shut up and do it.
00:54:39.52 --> 00:54:40.52 They're going to hear, give this to your team.
00:54:40.52 --> 00:54:41.52 Here's the order.
00:54:41.52 --> 00:54:46.08 Let's go execute.
00:54:46.08 --> 00:54:50.16 Which is funny, because people go, oh, you know, these military, these military wave leading
00:54:50.16 --> 00:54:51.88 wouldn't work in the civilian world.
00:54:51.88 --> 00:54:53.72 It's like, what are you talking about?
00:54:53.72 --> 00:54:54.72 It's always fun.
00:54:54.72 --> 00:54:57.28 Life's like, yeah, yeah, this is what exactly what Jockel did with me.
00:54:57.28 --> 00:54:58.28 He'd be like, hey, how do you want to do it?
00:54:58.28 --> 00:54:59.28 And I'd be like, how does this sound?
00:54:59.28 --> 00:55:00.28 I think we'd plan on this.
00:55:00.28 --> 00:55:02.28 Okay, cool.
00:55:02.28 --> 00:55:14.04 Five, furthermore, if and when you reach your military goal, the more you ask of the defeated
00:55:14.04 --> 00:55:16.84 side, the more trouble you will have.
00:55:16.84 --> 00:55:21.36 And the more cause you will have to provide for an ultimate attempt to reverse the settlement
00:55:21.36 --> 00:55:23.32 achieved by war.
00:55:23.32 --> 00:55:29.68 Again, when you impose your plan on people, when you impose your will on people, there
00:55:29.68 --> 00:55:37.76 will be Oregon rejection of that.
00:55:37.76 --> 00:55:45.36 Force is a vicious cycle or rather a spiral unless its application is controlled by the
00:55:45.36 --> 00:55:50.72 most carefully seasoned calculation.
00:55:50.72 --> 00:55:51.72 Just think about that.
00:55:51.72 --> 00:55:54.000 Is it common thing I tell clients?
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.72 You want to lead with minimum force required.
00:55:55.72 --> 00:55:56.72 Tell you want to lead.
00:55:56.72 --> 00:55:58.44 If I don't have to say anything that's the best.
00:55:58.44 --> 00:56:01.12 If I have to say, hey, this is maybe an idea.
00:56:01.12 --> 00:56:03.92 If I get to a point where I have to bark in order to someone and tell them, shut up and
00:56:03.92 --> 00:56:05.44 do what I told you to do, that's bad.
00:56:05.44 --> 00:56:08.12 That's the vicious circle of force.
00:56:08.12 --> 00:56:10.68 We don't like it.
00:56:10.68 --> 00:56:18.000 Thus war, which begins by denying reason, comes to vindicated, vindicated throughout all
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.04 phases of the struggle.
00:56:22.04 --> 00:56:27.80 The fighting instinct is necessary to success in the battlefield.
00:56:27.80 --> 00:56:38.80 Although even here, the combatant who can keep a cool head has an advantage over the man
00:56:38.80 --> 00:56:43.48 who sees red.
00:56:43.48 --> 00:56:45.20 That's his little caveat.
00:56:45.20 --> 00:56:52.16 He says, but the fighting instinct should always be written on a tight reign.
00:56:52.16 --> 00:56:57.72 The statesman who gives that instinct, it's head loses his own.
00:56:57.72 --> 00:57:00.68 If you just want to scrap cool, guess what's going to happen?
00:57:00.68 --> 00:57:02.52 You're going to lose your own head.
00:57:02.52 --> 00:57:10.28 He's not fit to take charge of the fate of a nation.
00:57:10.28 --> 00:57:16.52 Victory in the true sense implies that the state of peace and of one's people is better
00:57:16.52 --> 00:57:20.24 after the war than before.
00:57:20.24 --> 00:57:24.72 The only thing in this sense is only possible if a quick result can be gained or if a
00:57:24.72 --> 00:57:29.28 long effort can be economically proportioned to the national resources.
00:57:29.28 --> 00:57:32.40 How much are you investing?
00:57:32.40 --> 00:57:35.16 How much are you investing of capital from your company?
00:57:35.16 --> 00:57:39.92 How much are you investing in leadership capital?
00:57:39.92 --> 00:57:42.32 ROI, where's it at?
00:57:42.32 --> 00:57:46.80 The end must be adjusted to the means.
00:57:46.80 --> 00:57:49.36 We throw that one out all the time.
00:57:49.36 --> 00:57:54.44 And it's got the connotations of being a whim.
00:57:54.44 --> 00:57:55.68 Focus on your goal.
00:57:55.68 --> 00:58:08.28 There's 48 freaking inspirational memes a day set your goal and never fear from it.
00:58:08.28 --> 00:58:09.28 Cool.
00:58:09.28 --> 00:58:10.28 I got a better idea.
00:58:10.28 --> 00:58:14.28 How about the end must be adjusted to the means?
00:58:14.28 --> 00:58:15.28 Right?
00:58:15.28 --> 00:58:19.72 I want that Lambo.
00:58:19.72 --> 00:58:20.72 I want a dream board.
00:58:20.72 --> 00:58:25.96 I got a Lambo and I got an infinity pool.
00:58:25.96 --> 00:58:26.96 Cool.
00:58:26.96 --> 00:58:31.92 How's that Wendy's salary kicking in?
00:58:31.92 --> 00:58:32.92 Right?
00:58:32.92 --> 00:58:35.12 Adjust your means a little bit, man.
00:58:35.12 --> 00:58:37.60 Adjust the end to fit the means.
00:58:37.60 --> 00:58:38.60 Sure.
00:58:38.60 --> 00:58:40.60 Oh, this is again.
00:58:40.60 --> 00:58:45.000 No one's there's no there's no there's not one single inspirational
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.68 meme on the gram that says that says the end must be adjusted to the means.
00:58:50.68 --> 00:58:51.68 No one says that.
00:58:51.68 --> 00:58:52.96 Actually it's the opposite.
00:58:52.96 --> 00:58:56.76 It's far as in the inspirational quotes industry.
00:58:56.76 --> 00:58:58.76 Well, for lack of a better job.
00:58:58.76 --> 00:58:59.76 It's the exact opposite.
00:58:59.76 --> 00:59:00.76 Actually, yeah, yeah.
00:59:00.76 --> 00:59:02.88 It's like, hey, basically it's like a kid.
00:59:02.88 --> 00:59:04.16 Adjust the means to the means.
00:59:04.16 --> 00:59:05.16 Or the incident means.
00:59:05.16 --> 00:59:11.36 So it's kind of like, hey, don't freaking have this goal that's unrealistic essentially.
00:59:11.36 --> 00:59:12.36 Essentially.
00:59:12.36 --> 00:59:15.60 Like, it's unrealistic, right?
00:59:15.60 --> 00:59:16.60 It's irresponsible.
00:59:16.60 --> 00:59:17.60 It's irresponsible.
00:59:17.60 --> 00:59:18.84 You have an irresponsible goal right there.
00:59:18.84 --> 00:59:21.32 You can like whatever kill yourself doing it.
00:59:21.32 --> 00:59:25.92 You should go in the comment should be like your dumb should be right given
00:59:25.92 --> 00:59:26.92 that.
00:59:26.92 --> 00:59:27.92 Right?
00:59:27.92 --> 00:59:28.92 But they'll talk about it.
00:59:28.92 --> 00:59:30.72 There's someone right now that's going to hear this bill.
00:59:30.72 --> 00:59:31.72 I'm just going to bullshit.
00:59:31.72 --> 00:59:32.72 I'm just going to shit.
00:59:32.72 --> 00:59:33.72 Yeah.
00:59:33.72 --> 00:59:34.72 I'm going to shit you.
00:59:34.72 --> 00:59:35.72 You're dead.
00:59:35.72 --> 00:59:36.72 Oh, yeah.
00:59:36.72 --> 00:59:38.96 If you're down for the thing and I get it because I'm all tap.
00:59:38.96 --> 00:59:44.20 Well, heart like if you want to be a bit, you know, for your first 100 million.
00:59:44.20 --> 00:59:45.20 Oh yeah.
00:59:45.20 --> 00:59:46.20 Yeah.
00:59:46.20 --> 00:59:47.80 There's people that tap that twice.
00:59:47.80 --> 00:59:48.80 Oh yeah.
00:59:48.80 --> 00:59:49.80 Right?
00:59:49.80 --> 00:59:50.80 100% yes or in.
00:59:50.80 --> 00:59:53.28 And like for a moment, they're kind of like pumped.
00:59:53.28 --> 00:59:56.56 Yeah, I'm sure they're pumped the whole time.
00:59:56.56 --> 00:59:57.56 You tell the end.
00:59:57.56 --> 00:59:59.20 It's really, but no.
00:59:59.20 --> 01:00:03.88 Well, if you're the guy, if you're the guy who says this, what this book is saying, hey,
01:00:03.88 --> 01:00:05.60 like the end must be adjusted to the means.
01:00:05.60 --> 01:00:06.60 That's a good goal.
01:00:06.60 --> 01:00:07.88 Like that's a lofty goal.
01:00:07.88 --> 01:00:11.08 Which, you know, obviously I can't hate unlofty goals.
01:00:11.08 --> 01:00:12.80 Wait, that's not even really a lofty goal.
01:00:12.80 --> 01:00:14.92 That's just a realistic thing to do as a human.
01:00:14.92 --> 01:00:18.04 But the realistic human means.
01:00:18.04 --> 01:00:19.04 Yeah.
01:00:19.04 --> 01:00:22.36 Well, you know, the first one will be the end must be adjusted to the means.
01:00:22.36 --> 01:00:24.08 It's very not inspirational.
01:00:24.08 --> 01:00:25.36 They would get downvoted.
01:00:25.36 --> 01:00:26.36 Yeah.
01:00:26.36 --> 01:00:28.32 You'll be branded as the hate or really.
01:00:28.32 --> 01:00:29.32 Oh.
01:00:29.32 --> 01:00:31.60 Like that's the point where they, they'll brand you as a hate.
01:00:31.60 --> 01:00:32.88 It's like everyone's always hating.
01:00:32.88 --> 01:00:36.80 And you know where this goes into the whole idea.
01:00:36.80 --> 01:00:42.32 You're talking about of like, about hey, this isn't really sexy.
01:00:42.32 --> 01:00:46.000 This is the absolute like, non, this is getting downvoted.
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000 This is getting haters.
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000 Oh yeah.
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.56 And what's interesting is who you're going to, who's going to get the up vote, right?
01:00:54.56 --> 01:00:56.96 This person is getting, you're getting hated all.
01:00:56.96 --> 01:00:57.96 Oh yeah.
01:00:57.96 --> 01:00:59.24 Because you're like, actually, it's an unrealistic goal.
01:00:59.24 --> 01:01:00.24 You should check yourself.
01:01:00.24 --> 01:01:01.24 Right.
01:01:01.24 --> 01:01:02.24 All the downer, the doubter, right?
01:01:02.24 --> 01:01:03.24 Oh yeah.
01:01:03.24 --> 01:01:04.24 The doubter.
01:01:04.24 --> 01:01:05.24 Yeah.
01:01:05.24 --> 01:01:06.24 And the thing is that get it.
01:01:06.24 --> 01:01:09.80 Because everyone's in a great while you'll get someone who achieved this super lofty
01:01:09.80 --> 01:01:12.84 goal, not to say that they didn't just the ends to the means.
01:01:12.84 --> 01:01:16.68 Because they had the means up, currently at the end of the day, the means were there.
01:01:16.68 --> 01:01:18.72 Because they end is there to run.
01:01:18.72 --> 01:01:24.68 But he was the thing they had that un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un inspirational names.
01:01:24.68 --> 01:01:26.48 We'll just say realistic realistic means.
01:01:26.48 --> 01:01:27.48 Yeah.
01:01:27.48 --> 01:01:34.32 But unless they, they achieved that goal that was kind of untyp, not typically realistic.
01:01:34.32 --> 01:01:35.80 It's unrealistic, right?
01:01:35.80 --> 01:01:38.04 Compared to we speaking to whatever.
01:01:38.04 --> 01:01:40.24 And they achieved it.
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:46.92 I mean, we could easily argue that like, oh, this person did this because they had
01:01:46.92 --> 01:01:47.92 the mean.
01:01:47.92 --> 01:01:48.92 The means, right?
01:01:48.92 --> 01:01:50.56 That had the intellectual horsepower.
01:01:50.56 --> 01:01:52.84 They had the educational thing.
01:01:52.84 --> 01:01:54.24 They had the how always things set up.
01:01:54.24 --> 01:01:55.84 Oh, it's actually a realistic goal.
01:01:55.84 --> 01:01:56.84 I know that.
01:01:56.84 --> 01:01:57.84 That's what I'm saying.
01:01:57.84 --> 01:01:58.84 Where.
01:01:58.84 --> 01:02:04.56 But they'll take the, the crazy quantum, quote, unrealistic ends, right?
01:02:04.56 --> 01:02:05.56 The goal will say.
01:02:05.56 --> 01:02:06.56 But that's the one, right?
01:02:06.56 --> 01:02:08.56 The classic president of the United States.
01:02:08.56 --> 01:02:09.56 You can do anything you want.
01:02:09.56 --> 01:02:12.56 I'm going to send my goal the highest I possibly can in life, president of the United
01:02:12.56 --> 01:02:13.56 States.
01:02:13.56 --> 01:02:14.56 Right?
01:02:14.56 --> 01:02:16.44 So it'll be like, all right, cool.
01:02:16.44 --> 01:02:21.88 Therefore, we should all essentially set goals as high as president of the United States.
01:02:21.88 --> 01:02:22.88 Right?
01:02:22.88 --> 01:02:23.88 Okay.
01:02:23.88 --> 01:02:26.12 That's kind of the inspirational message, right?
01:02:26.12 --> 01:02:27.12 Okay.
01:02:27.12 --> 01:02:31.56 Meanwhile, the very few individuals that became president of the United States had
01:02:31.56 --> 01:02:33.60 the means.
01:02:33.60 --> 01:02:38.72 So they're ends technically by definition, we're adjusted.
01:02:38.72 --> 01:02:41.56 Their ends were adjusted to the means because they had the means.
01:02:41.56 --> 01:02:42.56 It's the same.
01:02:42.56 --> 01:02:43.56 Not everyone has the means.
01:02:43.56 --> 01:02:45.12 So you've got to adjust those.
01:02:45.12 --> 01:02:46.12 Yeah.
01:02:46.12 --> 01:02:48.16 Meanwhile, everyone's saying new, new, new, new, new, new.
01:02:48.16 --> 01:02:51.36 Don't if you can do it, I can do it too, right?
01:02:51.36 --> 01:02:53.40 Which, hey, I'm not saying they can't.
01:02:53.40 --> 01:02:54.68 I'm not even saying that.
01:02:54.68 --> 01:02:57.80 But I'm saying, hey, man, you've got to be realistic.
01:02:57.80 --> 01:02:59.36 Realistic on that can stuff.
01:02:59.36 --> 01:03:00.36 Yeah.
01:03:00.36 --> 01:03:01.36 Same saying.
01:03:01.36 --> 01:03:03.64 If you say that, you just can't say that.
01:03:03.64 --> 01:03:08.40 You know what's really crazy is like, I just got slapped in my own face thinking about
01:03:08.40 --> 01:03:12.000 this because we're kind of joking about this.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:20.60 But what he's saying and what he saw was hundreds and hundreds of thousands of soldiers
01:03:20.60 --> 01:03:26.84 that were killed because the leadership didn't adjust the ends to the means.
01:03:26.84 --> 01:03:27.84 Totally.
01:03:27.84 --> 01:03:29.56 Which is crazy to think about.
01:03:29.56 --> 01:03:34.32 As you guys are talking, I was thinking my mind, like, people have figured this out.
01:03:34.32 --> 01:03:36.24 There are even phrases out there.
01:03:36.24 --> 01:03:41.24 The one I kept thinking of as you're talking about this is I remember the phrase, live
01:03:41.24 --> 01:03:42.84 within your means.
01:03:42.84 --> 01:03:45.08 Like, I've heard that's a phrase.
01:03:45.08 --> 01:03:50.08 What it's not is it's not hanging on a poster in any kid's bedroom anywhere.
01:03:50.08 --> 01:03:51.72 Like, I don't go to bed tonight.
01:03:51.72 --> 01:03:52.72 Like it's an unreal going.
01:03:52.72 --> 01:03:55.96 I'm going to live within my means.
01:03:55.96 --> 01:04:01.08 The irony inside that is the best way to actually, ultimately expand your means over
01:04:01.08 --> 01:04:04.08 time so your means get greater and greater is to do exactly that.
01:04:04.08 --> 01:04:13.04 Like, that's the trick to it is the dissatisfaction of the reality is something people overlook.
01:04:13.04 --> 01:04:19.20 And the the unfunny part of that, which is the sobering piece that you just mentioned is that
01:04:19.20 --> 01:04:24.92 it can actually lead people down a path to do exactly what you just said.
01:04:24.92 --> 01:04:31.84 Which, which almost seems not possible except for the fact that these that he specifically
01:04:31.84 --> 01:04:36.72 live that in a way that is, what are we doing here?
01:04:36.72 --> 01:04:37.72 What are we doing?
01:04:37.72 --> 01:04:41.84 What are we expanding to a and what are we accomplishing by doing that?
01:04:41.84 --> 01:04:44.52 So it wasn't just the national exhaustion.
01:04:44.52 --> 01:04:47.92 It was the national exhaustion with nothing to show for it.
01:04:47.92 --> 01:04:53.76 And then the scale of that, which is, which is impossible as opposed to, hey, why don't
01:04:53.76 --> 01:04:55.32 we operate within our means here?
01:04:55.32 --> 01:04:56.32 Why don't we do that?
01:04:56.32 --> 01:04:57.32 Yeah.
01:04:57.32 --> 01:05:01.04 And if you fast forward the kid, if there was a kid that had a post on a wall that
01:05:01.04 --> 01:05:05.80 certainly lived within your means and therefore they're saving and they're putting together.
01:05:05.80 --> 01:05:09.48 And you look at them in 20 years and they're in a way better position than something
01:05:09.48 --> 01:05:14.88 that was like, you know, you need the Lambo for whatever.
01:05:14.88 --> 01:05:15.88 Right?
01:05:15.88 --> 01:05:20.000 Because they're going to end up in debt and they can't invest properly.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.28 And they have to work a job that they don't really like and it's a job that's a dead
01:05:24.28 --> 01:05:25.28 end job.
01:05:25.28 --> 01:05:27.12 I like all these things add up.
01:05:27.12 --> 01:05:31.20 You said something about you being an NBA basketball player.
01:05:31.20 --> 01:05:37.68 I would say on record, on a inspirational or demotivational post saying, hey, bro, that's
01:05:37.68 --> 01:05:38.68 unrealistic.
01:05:38.68 --> 01:05:40.32 I would tell you that.
01:05:40.32 --> 01:05:45.52 And I think factually it is under, well, just as factually goes, it is unrealistic.
01:05:45.52 --> 01:05:51.12 I don't know that I would tell a high school kid that when he's really into basketball.
01:05:51.12 --> 01:05:54.48 I don't know if I would say that.
01:05:54.48 --> 01:05:58.20 It'd be unrealistic in certain ways, like if the underserved circumstances or whatever,
01:05:58.20 --> 01:06:02.72 but given how you consider it most people how they get into professional sports whenever
01:06:02.72 --> 01:06:05.40 they work hard, they really love the sport.
01:06:05.40 --> 01:06:09.88 They go through trials and tribulations or whatever and they end up making it kind of a thing.
01:06:09.88 --> 01:06:14.64 So if you get someone that's kind of in the beginning of that type of path where that
01:06:14.64 --> 01:06:18.72 path is not straight up blocked off or whatever reason, like it would be in your case,
01:06:18.72 --> 01:06:20.96 I wouldn't really say that's unrealistic.
01:06:20.96 --> 01:06:26.000 The point is there are really cases where it's unrealistic.
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.32 So if you tried to be an NBA player, hired the best coach in the world, I get it.
01:06:33.32 --> 01:06:37.12 You would wind up exhausting all your research.
01:06:37.12 --> 01:06:38.72 I should adjust my end.
01:06:38.72 --> 01:06:41.32 I'm going to answer.
01:06:41.32 --> 01:06:46.08 You might want to make sure that you're a kid who you don't want to stifle that dream,
01:06:46.08 --> 01:06:49.68 you might want to make sure that they're not putting all the rags in that one basket
01:06:49.68 --> 01:06:50.68 and two.
01:06:50.68 --> 01:06:52.92 Hey, listen, go for it.
01:06:52.92 --> 01:06:55.32 But you're not going to drop out of school.
01:06:55.32 --> 01:07:03.84 You're not going to stop doing this in this with the ultimate meme of focus on your goals
01:07:03.84 --> 01:07:05.64 and block out every distraction.
01:07:05.64 --> 01:07:08.36 So I'm done with school because school is stupid because school ain't going to help
01:07:08.36 --> 01:07:09.64 me be an NBA player.
01:07:09.64 --> 01:07:13.32 Meanwhile, you're five, six, you're done growing.
01:07:13.32 --> 01:07:16.84 You're not that good of a shot, but you've got this passion.
01:07:16.84 --> 01:07:19.28 You might want to keep that kid on the track of, hey, cool.
01:07:19.28 --> 01:07:20.56 I'm out here to crush your dreams.
01:07:20.56 --> 01:07:24.04 However, comma, let's consider some other things as you're doing that.
01:07:24.04 --> 01:07:25.72 Actually, you should never have a plan B.
01:07:25.72 --> 01:07:27.72 That means you're not fully committed to a plan B.
01:07:27.72 --> 01:07:28.72 That's right.
01:07:28.72 --> 01:07:29.72 You've got a plan B.
01:07:29.72 --> 01:07:30.72 I guess you're not committed to planning.
01:07:30.72 --> 01:07:32.20 There's inspirational meme for you.
01:07:32.20 --> 01:07:35.20 Actually, he addresses some of this here.
01:07:35.20 --> 01:07:38.76 Going back to the book, failing a fair prospect of such a victory.
01:07:38.76 --> 01:07:42.56 So the end must be adjusted to me as failing a fair prospect of such a victory.
01:07:42.56 --> 01:07:47.72 Why statesmanship will miss no opportunity for negotiating peace.
01:07:47.72 --> 01:07:53.48 Peace through stalemate based on a coincident recognition by each side of the opponent's
01:07:53.48 --> 01:07:59.12 strength is at least preferable to peace through common exhaustion and has often provided
01:07:59.12 --> 01:08:03.68 a better foundation for lasting peace.
01:08:03.68 --> 01:08:10.96 It is wiser to run risks of war for the sake of preserving peace than to risk run the
01:08:10.96 --> 01:08:17.12 risk of exhaustion in war for the sake of finishing with victory.
01:08:17.12 --> 01:08:25.36 A conclusion that runs counter to custom but is supported by experience.
01:08:25.36 --> 01:08:31.56 So it's better to like, maybe we don't have war and we just kind of maintain peace with
01:08:31.56 --> 01:08:33.64 kind of what I've got.
01:08:33.64 --> 01:08:35.92 That's a better deal than you know what.
01:08:35.92 --> 01:08:43.36 We're just going to exhaust ourselves and hope for some kind of a victory.
01:08:43.36 --> 01:08:51.52 Perseverance in war is only justifiable if there is a good chance of a good end.
01:08:51.52 --> 01:08:58.80 The prospect of a peace that will balance the sum of human misery incurred in the struggle.
01:08:58.80 --> 01:09:04.08 Like each one of these statements, Dave, you just shake your head knowing where it came from.
01:09:04.08 --> 01:09:08.80 That's all I'm thinking is every one of these is what he, what this comes from, it's
01:09:08.80 --> 01:09:14.08 just how savage that experience had it with been for him.
01:09:14.08 --> 01:09:19.04 Indeed, deepening the study of past experience leads to the conclusion that nations might
01:09:19.04 --> 01:09:23.88 often have come nearer to their object by taking advantage of a low in the struggle to
01:09:23.88 --> 01:09:30.12 discuss a settlement than by pursuing the war with the aim of victory.
01:09:30.12 --> 01:09:33.52 History, so look man, you got to look for those opportunities.
01:09:33.52 --> 01:09:38.40 We have a little low, hey, you want to keep going with us, or you want to maybe stand down.
01:09:38.40 --> 01:09:42.36 History reveals also that in many cases a beneficial peace could have been obtained if
01:09:42.36 --> 01:09:47.80 the statesmen of the warring nations had shown more understanding of the elements of psychology
01:09:47.80 --> 01:09:49.76 and their peace feelers.
01:09:49.76 --> 01:09:53.24 So you get the peace feelers out there like, what?
01:09:53.24 --> 01:09:56.44 Let me sense about what's happening here.
01:09:56.44 --> 01:09:58.12 And people don't have good understanding of their peace.
01:09:58.12 --> 01:10:02.12 They don't recognize their peace feelers.
01:10:02.12 --> 01:10:09.64 Their attitude is commonly been to akin to that scene in the typical domestic quarry.
01:10:09.64 --> 01:10:10.64 Right?
01:10:10.64 --> 01:10:12.92 So now we've got to fight with our wife.
01:10:12.92 --> 01:10:17.56 Each party is afraid to appear yielding with the result that when one of them shows any
01:10:17.56 --> 01:10:24.80 inclination towards consolation, this is usually expressed in language that is too stiff.
01:10:24.80 --> 01:10:29.16 While the other is apt to be slow to respond partly from pride or or obscency and partly
01:10:29.16 --> 01:10:33.40 from a tendency to interpret such a gesture as a sign of weakness when it may be a sign of
01:10:33.40 --> 01:10:34.96 returning to common sense.
01:10:34.96 --> 01:10:36.44 The classic, right?
01:10:36.44 --> 01:10:38.44 I'm not going to apologize.
01:10:38.44 --> 01:10:40.08 I'm just saying you're sorry.
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:41.44 Yeah, just saying you're sorry.
01:10:41.44 --> 01:10:42.44 Sorry.
01:10:42.44 --> 01:10:43.44 Don't look weak.
01:10:43.44 --> 01:10:49.76 Thus, the faithful moment of passes and the conflict continues to the common damage.
01:10:49.76 --> 01:10:50.76 Right?
01:10:50.76 --> 01:10:54.72 We are killing ourselves over something that we could easily say, hey, look, I'm sorry,
01:10:54.72 --> 01:10:58.04 it's my fault.
01:10:58.04 --> 01:11:02.68 Rarely does a continuation serve any good purpose where the two parties are bound to
01:11:02.68 --> 01:11:04.52 go on living under the same roof.
01:11:04.52 --> 01:11:09.96 This applies even more to modern war than to domestic conflict since the industrialization
01:11:09.96 --> 01:11:14.08 of nations has made their fortunes inseparable.
01:11:14.08 --> 01:11:19.64 It is the responsibility of statesmanship never to lose sight of the post war prospect
01:11:19.64 --> 01:11:28.44 in chasing the mirage of victory.
01:11:28.44 --> 01:11:33.16 Where two, where the two sides are two evenly matched to offer reasonable chance of early
01:11:33.16 --> 01:11:40.36 success to either the statesman is wise who can learn something from the psychology of strategy.
01:11:40.36 --> 01:11:45.40 It is the elementary principle of strategy that if you find your opponent in a strong position
01:11:45.40 --> 01:11:50.76 costly to force, you should leave him a line of retreat as the quickest way of loosening
01:11:50.76 --> 01:11:51.76 his resistance.
01:11:51.76 --> 01:11:54.76 Get personal way out.
01:11:54.76 --> 01:11:57.72 It should equally be the principal policy, especially in order to provide your opponent
01:11:57.72 --> 01:12:00.56 with a ladder by which he can climb down.
01:12:00.56 --> 01:12:03.76 Get people away out.
01:12:03.76 --> 01:12:06.84 Give your wife away out in that argument.
01:12:06.84 --> 01:12:09.88 Give your subordinate away out in that argument.
01:12:09.88 --> 01:12:12.56 Give your boss away out.
01:12:12.56 --> 01:12:17.68 Don't make them dig in, don't make them fight to the death.
01:12:17.68 --> 01:12:22.32 The question may arise as to whether such conclusions based on the history of war between
01:12:22.32 --> 01:12:28.20 so-called civilized states apply to the conditions inherent in a renewal of the type of purely
01:12:28.20 --> 01:12:35.40 predatory war that was waged by the barbarian assailants of the Roman Empire or the mixed
01:12:35.40 --> 01:12:43.40 religious and predatory war that was pursued by the fanatical followers of Mohammed.
01:12:43.40 --> 01:12:51.24 In such wars, any negotiated peace tends to have in itself even less than the normal
01:12:51.24 --> 01:12:52.72 value.
01:12:52.72 --> 01:12:57.72 It is only two clear from the history that states rarely keep the faith with each other,
01:12:57.72 --> 01:13:04.64 save in so far and so long as their promises seem to them to combine with their interests.
01:13:04.64 --> 01:13:06.96 That's a good thing to note.
01:13:06.96 --> 01:13:10.08 I'm not going to keep any promises if they're not from my benefit.
01:13:10.08 --> 01:13:12.92 That's what history tells us.
01:13:12.92 --> 01:13:19.88 And now we're talking about extremists, whether it's the barbarians attacking the Romans
01:13:19.88 --> 01:13:29.44 or the Islamists attacking the West back in the day.
01:13:29.44 --> 01:13:36.04 The less that a nation has regard for moral obligations, the more it tends to respect
01:13:36.04 --> 01:13:39.52 physical strength, the deterrent power of a force too strong to be challenged with the
01:13:39.52 --> 01:13:40.52 beauty.
01:13:40.52 --> 01:13:44.44 You got somebody that's not going to, you make peace with them, but you don't trust them,
01:13:44.44 --> 01:13:45.44 guess what?
01:13:45.44 --> 01:13:47.12 You better be strong.
01:13:47.12 --> 01:13:55.60 People don't respect the moral obligation they respect strength.
01:13:55.60 --> 01:13:59.44 In the same way, with individuals, it is a matter of common experience that the bully
01:13:59.44 --> 01:14:04.24 type and the Robert type hesitate to assail anyone who approaches their own strength.
01:14:04.24 --> 01:14:05.24 Check.
01:14:05.24 --> 01:14:14.40 You don't see the bully picking on the big yoke-dupe guy with cauliflower ears.
01:14:14.40 --> 01:14:18.40 It is folly to imagine that the aggressive types of weather individuals or nations can
01:14:18.40 --> 01:14:25.84 be bought off or in modern language appeased since the payment of dangheld simulates
01:14:25.84 --> 01:14:28.96 a demand for more dangheld.
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:31.000 What's dangheld you asked?
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.64 It's Viking protection money.
01:14:34.64 --> 01:14:36.48 Like hey, you can live here.
01:14:36.48 --> 01:14:37.48 I need some dangheld.
01:14:37.48 --> 01:14:41.24 You got to pay me a little bit of something.
01:14:41.24 --> 01:14:43.000 And what does that do?
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000 Makes me want more.
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000 Oh, the Viking?
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000 Yeah.
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.24 But dang, I need some protection money from you.
01:14:50.24 --> 01:14:54.64 You can work this corner, but you got to give me my cut.
01:14:54.64 --> 01:14:58.000 What does that make me want more cut?
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.52 So you can't buy them off.
01:15:01.52 --> 01:15:02.76 But they can be curb.
01:15:02.76 --> 01:15:07.72 They're very belief in force makes it more susceptible to the deterrent effect of a formidable
01:15:07.72 --> 01:15:13.84 opposing force. This forms an adequate check except against pure fanaticism, a fanaticism
01:15:13.84 --> 01:15:17.88 that is unmixed.
01:15:17.88 --> 01:15:21.28 So you get pure fanaticism, it doesn't matter if I'm going to kill you or not.
01:15:21.28 --> 01:15:25.12 You're going to come.
01:15:25.12 --> 01:15:30.76 While it is hard to make real peace with the predatory types, it is easier to induce them
01:15:30.76 --> 01:15:36.24 to accept the state of truth and far less exhausting than an attempt to crush them whereby
01:15:36.24 --> 01:15:42.76 they are like all types of mankind infused with the courage of desperation.
01:15:42.76 --> 01:15:47.000 So we have to be strong.
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.04 You have to be strong.
01:15:50.04 --> 01:15:56.16 And look, if you're stronger than these predatory fanatics, it doesn't necessarily mean
01:15:56.16 --> 01:16:00.32 you want to go to war with them because they're going to fight desperately.
01:16:00.32 --> 01:16:03.84 But if you're strong and you can keep them in check, that's sort of a good balance
01:16:03.84 --> 01:16:08.84 of power that's acceptable.
01:16:08.84 --> 01:16:14.24 I don't know how many more you've got on this, but I'm just thinking of all the things
01:16:14.24 --> 01:16:20.24 he's describing, all the behavior and the reaction, the action and the reaction.
01:16:20.24 --> 01:16:22.44 It's all human nature.
01:16:22.44 --> 01:16:27.36 This is how they will respond to this.
01:16:27.36 --> 01:16:33.60 And the repetitiveness and he keeps coming back to this idea is like, this is not
01:16:33.60 --> 01:16:35.60 a sample size of one.
01:16:35.60 --> 01:16:38.36 This isn't just one thing that's happened in history.
01:16:38.36 --> 01:16:40.92 And I think that's the power of the idea of human nature.
01:16:40.92 --> 01:16:42.68 This is how people will react.
01:16:42.68 --> 01:16:43.68 This is how people will respond.
01:16:43.68 --> 01:16:51.84 And if you understand human nature, that to us is the foundation of leadership.
01:16:51.84 --> 01:16:53.68 This is a human nature endeavor.
01:16:53.68 --> 01:16:57.76 Understanding how people will react.
01:16:57.76 --> 01:17:02.92 And anytime we behave in the extremes, there will be a reaction to that.
01:17:02.92 --> 01:17:07.72 To us operating in the extremes, there will be a natural human reaction to some other
01:17:07.72 --> 01:17:08.72 extreme.
01:17:08.72 --> 01:17:14.56 And the easy, like, hey, you want to subduge human nature, be moderate, limit the natural
01:17:14.56 --> 01:17:15.56 reaction.
01:17:15.56 --> 01:17:18.08 Hey, have a little bit of something over here, have a little something over here, but just
01:17:18.08 --> 01:17:21.96 listening to all the things you're saying is a human nature, human nature, human nature.
01:17:21.96 --> 01:17:22.96 Yeah.
01:17:22.96 --> 01:17:25.48 And the response to be balanced, be balanced, be balanced, be balanced.
01:17:25.48 --> 01:17:30.96 Be defined, be defined, be in the middle to limit to minimize the reaction that you're
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:35.52 going to get.
01:17:35.52 --> 01:17:36.52 Total war.
01:17:36.52 --> 01:17:37.52 Cool.
01:17:37.52 --> 01:17:38.52 You win.
01:17:38.52 --> 01:17:39.52 Guess what you got now?
01:17:39.52 --> 01:17:40.52 You got an insurgency.
01:17:40.52 --> 01:17:41.52 It's going to last for 20 years.
01:17:41.52 --> 01:17:43.76 And is that really what you want?
01:17:43.76 --> 01:17:47.16 Or could you maybe operate with some restraint understanding that what you're really
01:17:47.16 --> 01:17:48.48 trying to do is not beat them?
01:17:48.48 --> 01:17:52.000 What you're really trying to do is create a piece for a couple of decades, maybe?
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.84 Could you think of the long game here?
01:17:54.84 --> 01:18:00.28 Again, that's probably not going on a post or somewhere.
01:18:00.28 --> 01:18:06.40 So you're not getting recruited into the Marine Corps without one.
01:18:06.40 --> 01:18:12.04 Here's a little warning for us.
01:18:12.04 --> 01:18:17.80 The experience of history brings ample evidence that the downfall of civilized states tends
01:18:17.80 --> 01:18:25.80 to come out from the direct assaults of foes, but from internal decay combined with the consequences
01:18:25.80 --> 01:18:30.56 of exhaustion in war.
01:18:30.56 --> 01:18:34.68 That's a little warning.
01:18:34.68 --> 01:18:40.92 A state of suspense is trying.
01:18:40.92 --> 01:18:45.44 And as usage of the word suspense, there is like mental indecision.
01:18:45.44 --> 01:18:50.28 A state of suspense or mental indecision is trying.
01:18:50.28 --> 01:18:55.56 It is often lead nations as well as individuals to commit suicide because they were
01:18:55.56 --> 01:18:59.000 unable to bear it.
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:07.16 But suspense is better than to reach exhaustion in pursuit of the mirage of victory.
01:19:07.16 --> 01:19:09.52 That's a bold statement.
01:19:09.52 --> 01:19:11.96 So indecision can be so bad.
01:19:11.96 --> 01:19:16.84 This existence of indecision can be so bad that you can destroy yourself.
01:19:16.84 --> 01:19:18.16 You can kill yourself.
01:19:18.16 --> 01:19:22.24 You want to kill yourself.
01:19:22.24 --> 01:19:29.84 But that's actually better than to just exhaust yourself completely in pursuit of a victory
01:19:29.84 --> 01:19:32.40 that can't be had.
01:19:32.40 --> 01:19:41.08 What's counter intuitive about that is this idea that humans, we need to go towards.
01:19:41.08 --> 01:19:42.08 We need to go.
01:19:42.08 --> 01:19:43.08 We need something.
01:19:43.08 --> 01:19:44.08 We want something.
01:19:44.08 --> 01:19:45.08 We want to struggle.
01:19:45.08 --> 01:19:46.88 We want to fight.
01:19:46.88 --> 01:19:51.92 What he's saying here is like, let's think twice about that one.
01:19:51.92 --> 01:20:01.20 And I think it's probably because he understands what the true exhaustion of a state looks
01:20:01.20 --> 01:20:05.000 like.
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.44 On a scale that most people can't comprehend.
01:20:10.44 --> 01:20:16.72 He said this before I remember it, the mirage of victory, the mirage.
01:20:16.72 --> 01:20:20.72 What you are seeing, this goal that you are working towards, it's actually not a thing.
01:20:20.72 --> 01:20:22.72 It's not a real thing, it's a mirage.
01:20:22.72 --> 01:20:26.28 And you've convinced yourself, victory for me is I defeat Jocca.
01:20:26.28 --> 01:20:27.28 That's victory.
01:20:27.28 --> 01:20:30.24 And I am going to move towards that until it happens.
01:20:30.24 --> 01:20:31.64 But that's actually not a real thing.
01:20:31.64 --> 01:20:33.64 It's not a real thing.
01:20:33.64 --> 01:20:34.64 Yeah.
01:20:34.64 --> 01:20:35.64 It's not a real thing.
01:20:35.64 --> 01:20:38.24 And what you'll end up with is an insurgency.
01:20:38.24 --> 01:20:39.24 Or exhaustive.
01:20:39.24 --> 01:20:40.24 Or exhaustive.
01:20:40.24 --> 01:20:41.56 Or whatever else.
01:20:41.56 --> 01:20:44.16 Or you'll rule over the Baron Wasteland that I left.
01:20:44.16 --> 01:20:44.16 Right.
01:20:44.16 --> 01:20:50.68 More over a truce to actual hostility.
01:20:50.68 --> 01:20:57.12 Enables a recovery and development of strength while the need for vigilance keeps a nation
01:20:57.12 --> 01:21:00.92 on its toes.
01:21:00.92 --> 01:21:02.32 So we're looking for a truce.
01:21:02.32 --> 01:21:03.80 It's OK.
01:21:03.80 --> 01:21:09.84 Peaceful nations are apt however to court unnecessary danger because when once aroused, they
01:21:09.84 --> 01:21:16.80 are more inclined to proceed to extremes than predatory nations.
01:21:16.80 --> 01:21:17.80 Interesting.
01:21:17.80 --> 01:21:21.84 This is like the guy that's sort of quiet and keep me to himself.
01:21:21.84 --> 01:21:29.16 But when you piss them off, then they freaking go ham.
01:21:29.16 --> 01:21:32.20 That's a technical definition as well.
01:21:32.20 --> 01:21:37.24 For the latter making war as a means of gain are usually more ready to call it often.
01:21:37.24 --> 01:21:42.12 They find an opponent too strong or too easily overcome.
01:21:42.12 --> 01:21:47.76 And this is really the last point for this book that we're going to talk about.
01:21:47.76 --> 01:21:51.04 It is the reluctant fighter.
01:21:51.04 --> 01:21:58.80 Impheld by emotion and not by calculation who tends to press a fight to the better end.
01:21:58.80 --> 01:22:07.36 thereby he too often defeats his own end even if he does not produce his own direct defeat.
01:22:07.36 --> 01:22:15.52 For the spirit of barbarism can be weakened only during a cessation of hostilities.
01:22:15.52 --> 01:22:23.60 For strengthens it pouring fuel on the flames.
01:22:23.60 --> 01:22:32.80 So by attacking people by attacking the barbarians and we attack them we make them stronger.
01:22:32.80 --> 01:22:37.52 We make them fight harder.
01:22:37.52 --> 01:22:40.08 War makes them stronger.
01:22:40.08 --> 01:22:45.84 Makes them fight, makes them resist, pours fuel on the flames.
01:22:45.84 --> 01:22:50.08 We can only weaken them by backing off a little bit.
01:22:50.08 --> 01:22:52.20 Again, this is not the recruiting poster.
01:22:52.20 --> 01:22:54.20 It's so counterintuitive.
01:22:54.20 --> 01:22:59.80 It's so counterintuitive to the natural reaction of push harder.
01:22:59.80 --> 01:23:07.000 Be more dominant to get the outcome that you want.
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.84 So we're here for the truce.
01:23:10.84 --> 01:23:13.48 We're here for the compromise.
01:23:13.48 --> 01:23:16.84 It's so counterintuitive to what we preach what we want.
01:23:16.84 --> 01:23:18.48 Which is total victory.
01:23:18.48 --> 01:23:19.48 I like total victory.
01:23:19.48 --> 01:23:20.48 That sounds good.
01:23:20.48 --> 01:23:22.48 It's a morage.
01:23:22.48 --> 01:23:25.64 Just never compromise.
01:23:25.64 --> 01:23:27.64 No compromise.
01:23:27.64 --> 01:23:31.84 That's another great inspirational.
01:23:31.84 --> 01:23:35.88 Because there's none that say, hey, it's really good to compromise oftentimes and kind
01:23:35.88 --> 01:23:38.88 of take what you can get and work out a good deal.
01:23:38.88 --> 01:23:39.88 That's fair.
01:23:39.88 --> 01:23:45.12 We're going to get hammered for this.
01:23:45.12 --> 01:23:49.48 Some inspirational meme people are going to be mad at us.
01:23:49.48 --> 01:23:54.48 What's crazy is you can probably open up a disciplinary freedom field manual.
01:23:54.48 --> 01:23:56.28 We'll pull out some stuff like this.
01:23:56.28 --> 01:23:58.28 I got all kinds of stuff in there.
01:23:58.28 --> 01:24:01.28 Getting crazy.
01:24:01.28 --> 01:24:02.28 Right?
01:24:02.28 --> 01:24:04.28 You're going to make me crack it open and start reading.
01:24:04.28 --> 01:24:05.88 No.
01:24:05.88 --> 01:24:07.48 Guilty as charged.
01:24:07.48 --> 01:24:10.28 I'm kind of wanting to.
01:24:10.28 --> 01:24:15.84 Well, the good thing about your book is that it's not.
01:24:15.84 --> 01:24:22.04 It's not like you've done a good job whether it be in the book itself or compromise.
01:24:22.04 --> 01:24:25.56 Page 32, this is when it goes freedom field manual.
01:24:25.56 --> 01:24:28.92 When working with other people in dynamic, oh, this is see this is kind of cool.
01:24:28.92 --> 01:24:29.92 Here's what it says.
01:24:29.92 --> 01:24:31.60 This is just the first thing I opened up to.
01:24:31.60 --> 01:24:35.60 When working with other people and dynamic situations in relationships and deals, a person,
01:24:35.60 --> 01:24:39.56 especially a leader must compromise.
01:24:39.56 --> 01:24:44.56 Finding the common ground between teams, merging different approaches to the same problem,
01:24:44.56 --> 01:24:50.08 bridging personalities with people who might not get along, reaching agreements in courses
01:24:50.08 --> 01:24:54.20 of action, all of these require compromise.
01:24:54.20 --> 01:24:58.92 And in many cases, a failure to compromise is a failure to succeed.
01:24:58.92 --> 01:25:00.92 I guess maybe I'm wrong.
01:25:00.92 --> 01:25:07.000 I mean, maybe I'm wrong about me writing stuff that's inspirational mean crap.
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.08 But those are external compromises with other people, other humans that have their own personalities
01:25:12.08 --> 01:25:16.52 and ethos and issues and compromises needed to unify.
01:25:16.52 --> 01:25:19.08 So work with them, compromise.
01:25:19.08 --> 01:25:23.08 So to work with them, compromise is a must.
01:25:23.08 --> 01:25:24.44 Now with yourself.
01:25:24.44 --> 01:25:25.44 And then I wait.
01:25:25.44 --> 01:25:26.96 But internally, it's different.
01:25:26.96 --> 01:25:28.68 With myself, I have to hold the line.
01:25:28.68 --> 01:25:31.56 There are areas within myself where I cannot compromise.
01:25:31.56 --> 01:25:32.92 I'm going to work hard.
01:25:32.92 --> 01:25:33.92 I'm going to train hard.
01:25:33.92 --> 01:25:34.92 I'm going to improve myself.
01:25:34.92 --> 01:25:36.92 I'm not going to rest on my laurels.
01:25:36.92 --> 01:25:39.36 I'm going to confront my own mistakes.
01:25:39.36 --> 01:25:41.60 I'm going to own my mistakes and confront them.
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:43.40 I'm going to face my demons.
01:25:43.40 --> 01:25:45.92 I'm not going to give up or give out or give in.
01:25:45.92 --> 01:25:47.44 I'm going to stand.
01:25:47.44 --> 01:25:49.72 I'm going to maintain myself discipline.
01:25:49.72 --> 01:25:54.28 And on those points, there will be no compromise, not now, not ever.
01:25:54.28 --> 01:25:55.28 Whoa.
01:25:55.28 --> 01:25:57.68 That's pretty ins pretty pretty.
01:25:57.68 --> 01:26:00.16 We might go meme on that one.
01:26:00.16 --> 01:26:01.16 Sure.
01:26:01.16 --> 01:26:04.60 Yeah, if you go from the headline to the conclusion there and skip the content of the
01:26:04.60 --> 01:26:07.92 middle where it says compromise, not now, not ever.
01:26:07.92 --> 01:26:10.52 You got a little cross with an issue here where you're deciding.
01:26:10.52 --> 01:26:13.16 I was like, I didn't quite read the context.
01:26:13.16 --> 01:26:15.56 But I saw the page that said compromise ended.
01:26:15.56 --> 01:26:18.20 It said not now, not ever.
01:26:18.20 --> 01:26:19.20 Yeah.
01:26:19.20 --> 01:26:23.16 So I think if we go through this book, here's one called fight.
01:26:23.16 --> 01:26:24.60 Go down swinging.
01:26:24.60 --> 01:26:27.64 And I'll tell you, if you fight with all you have more often than not, you won't
01:26:27.64 --> 01:26:28.68 go down at all.
01:26:28.68 --> 01:26:31.000 You will win.
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.16 But you have to make that attitude part of your everyday life.
01:26:34.16 --> 01:26:38.84 Do the extra repetition, run the extra mile, go the extra round, make the right choices,
01:26:38.84 --> 01:26:40.40 give the full measure.
01:26:40.40 --> 01:26:43.52 I'm in the game.
01:26:43.52 --> 01:26:45.76 I think I'm in the inspirational meme game.
01:26:45.76 --> 01:26:49.96 Yeah, you are, but what I was going to say is like, yeah, you do that.
01:26:49.96 --> 01:26:55.52 But the good thing about having a whole book and a whole podcast and eight million other
01:26:55.52 --> 01:27:00.20 books is, or whatever, you're going to explain the whole situation rather than just have
01:27:00.20 --> 01:27:01.20 the one post.
01:27:01.20 --> 01:27:02.20 You see what I'm saying?
01:27:02.20 --> 01:27:03.20 Yeah.
01:27:03.20 --> 01:27:04.76 I mean, look, the entire book is predicate.
01:27:04.76 --> 01:27:09.32 I think the opening salvo you have is, this is about you.
01:27:09.32 --> 01:27:11.04 And you say, I am nothing but weakness.
01:27:11.04 --> 01:27:12.80 I am nothing but but flaws.
01:27:12.80 --> 01:27:13.80 I am nothing but these things.
01:27:13.80 --> 01:27:20.16 So this is the, this is what you are with yourself, with self discipline, as opposed
01:27:20.16 --> 01:27:25.20 to how I'm going to treat other people around me.
01:27:25.20 --> 01:27:27.20 Yes, this is aimed internally.
01:27:27.20 --> 01:27:28.20 Totally.
01:27:28.20 --> 01:27:34.36 I mean, in a literal sense, and that fight is against, I mean, it's even in the video
01:27:34.36 --> 01:27:37.92 that we show it at the most, I am nothing but weakness.
01:27:37.92 --> 01:27:42.08 And I'm going to fight against that weakness, that compromise, all those things that
01:27:42.08 --> 01:27:47.88 might mind me, that's telling me to do to myself, which is, I think also you could look
01:27:47.88 --> 01:27:51.96 in the terms like the difference between imposed discipline and self discipline.
01:27:51.96 --> 01:27:55.12 Imposed discipline does not work and self discipline does.
01:27:55.12 --> 01:27:57.60 That's simple as that.
01:27:57.60 --> 01:28:04.64 And as we impose ourselves on other people, in war, in leadership, in parenting, in insert
01:28:04.64 --> 01:28:08.96 any human interaction, human and another human, when you impose your discipline, when
01:28:08.96 --> 01:28:14.20 you impose yourself on them, in the end you will lose.
01:28:14.20 --> 01:28:16.56 But it's much more efficient just to impose your way.
01:28:16.56 --> 01:28:17.56 Yes, faster.
01:28:17.56 --> 01:28:20.84 Oh, man.
01:28:20.84 --> 01:28:21.84 So there we go.
01:28:21.84 --> 01:28:23.20 That's what we're going to cover for this book.
01:28:23.20 --> 01:28:27.68 That I've kind of, I guess, foreshadowed some of the other things we're doing in the future.
01:28:27.68 --> 01:28:31.04 And it's one of those things.
01:28:31.04 --> 01:28:38.000 If you can take these lessons, these lessons written in blood, not just in one more, but
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:46.84 in war after war, after war, and the exclamation point of World War I, you can learn
01:28:46.84 --> 01:28:54.60 a lot and you can apply this and we know that it's not as striking, we know it's not as sexy,
01:28:54.60 --> 01:29:07.92 we know it's not as mean worthy as some of the more direct approaches.
01:29:07.92 --> 01:29:09.36 We know that.
01:29:09.36 --> 01:29:18.48 But this is to give the original name, this is how to win wars.
01:29:18.48 --> 01:29:27.08 With that speaking of winning wars, echo Charles, we want to win the war on ourselves.
01:29:27.08 --> 01:29:28.08 We do.
01:29:28.08 --> 01:29:35.80 Yeah, that when you say win wars, when wars, you don't tend to, this is one of the
01:29:35.80 --> 01:29:40.24 takeaways that I think, hey dang, that's something good to remember.
01:29:40.24 --> 01:29:44.04 When you think about war fair and winning the war, you don't think about the peace that
01:29:44.04 --> 01:29:46.04 afterwards, like the aftermath.
01:29:46.04 --> 01:29:49.88 So I grew up on quiet.
01:29:49.88 --> 01:29:54.52 So the thing about quiet is like, if you get in a fight with someone and you don't resolve
01:29:54.52 --> 01:29:56.32 it in a peaceful way, I don't care how.
01:29:56.32 --> 01:29:59.80 I don't care if it's kind of, hey, we don't like each other for no good reason and we just
01:29:59.80 --> 01:30:02.60 fight him, okay, we're cool, we fought and we're done.
01:30:02.60 --> 01:30:05.52 If you don't resolve it in some peaceful way, you got to deal with somebody's cousin.
01:30:05.52 --> 01:30:10.48 Somebody's brother, somebody's whoever, neighbor who's just down for the cause or whatever
01:30:10.48 --> 01:30:12.40 and you're gonna see him again too.
01:30:12.40 --> 01:30:13.40 That's the thing.
01:30:13.40 --> 01:30:17.28 You go to the store, he's gonna be there next week or whatever.
01:30:17.28 --> 01:30:19.44 So it's kind of one of those things where it's kind of in the back of your mind.
01:30:19.44 --> 01:30:23.44 If I'm gonna fight this guy, I sort of got to deal with that content with that long,
01:30:23.44 --> 01:30:24.44 that long game.
01:30:24.44 --> 01:30:28.44 Is there a methodology to get that resolved post fight?
01:30:28.44 --> 01:30:30.84 Yeah, I think so.
01:30:30.84 --> 01:30:36.48 I've, all the fights I've ever been in have never been like lasting, like it'd be like
01:30:36.48 --> 01:30:39.16 a fight and then we're friends afterwards.
01:30:39.16 --> 01:30:44.20 But I was a kid, so I had very little understanding of that.
01:30:44.20 --> 01:30:48.24 But nonetheless, the point is where that's something that when we think of warfare, we think
01:30:48.24 --> 01:30:52.04 of, oh, defeat, cross your enemies, having driven before you.
01:30:52.04 --> 01:30:53.04 You seem to say.
01:30:53.04 --> 01:30:55.16 And we don't think about that all the way.
01:30:55.16 --> 01:31:00.08 And you got your neighbor, his freaking dog or whatever, his barking, his tree is growing
01:31:00.08 --> 01:31:02.92 over your fence and you're gonna, you guys are wearing yours.
01:31:02.92 --> 01:31:04.76 It's like, right, you want to do that.
01:31:04.76 --> 01:31:06.52 You know, you got to live next to that guy.
01:31:06.52 --> 01:31:09.64 When you go to the post office or whatever, you go to your car and you see him getting
01:31:09.64 --> 01:31:12.44 his car too, you're like, oh, it's all awkward or whatever.
01:31:12.44 --> 01:31:14.96 Like, right, you don't have to do it like that, you know?
01:31:14.96 --> 01:31:19.80 Are you really going to achieve the peace that you hoped for by beating this dude's ass
01:31:19.80 --> 01:31:20.80 right now?
01:31:20.80 --> 01:31:25.000 Yeah, well, just chances are you're not really, if you think a little bit, chances are you're
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.56 not thinking, hey, I'm gonna go to the distance right now.
01:31:27.56 --> 01:31:30.16 Like, I'm ready to just go, I'm ready to go all in.
01:31:30.16 --> 01:31:34.68 I'll fight every cousin, nephew, brother, sister.
01:31:34.68 --> 01:31:35.68 I don't care.
01:31:35.68 --> 01:31:37.52 Like, but that's where you can end up.
01:31:37.52 --> 01:31:38.52 Yeah, we want.
01:31:38.52 --> 01:31:39.52 We don't want to end up.
01:31:39.52 --> 01:31:42.36 In fact, that's a common thing, especially like with the neighbors or whatever, I'm
01:31:42.36 --> 01:31:45.32 going to tell him all, it's usually that kind of, I'm going to tell him off.
01:31:45.32 --> 01:31:47.84 I'm not going to take that from him or her, whatever.
01:31:47.84 --> 01:31:52.92 And meanwhile, 10, 20, 30 years you're wearing what this neighbor, right next door by the
01:31:52.92 --> 01:31:53.92 way.
01:31:53.92 --> 01:31:54.92 The feud.
01:31:54.92 --> 01:31:55.92 The feud.
01:31:55.92 --> 01:31:59.20 And then this little, total common thing, you know, when all you got to do is be like,
01:31:59.20 --> 01:32:03.64 hey, make a peaceful discourse.
01:32:03.64 --> 01:32:08.08 And you guys can live neighborly, you seem to say, preferable.
01:32:08.08 --> 01:32:12.08 But anyway, yeah, so the point is, like, thinking about that after math or considering
01:32:12.08 --> 01:32:13.28 that, it's a thing, you know.
01:32:13.28 --> 01:32:15.28 Let's do that.
01:32:15.28 --> 01:32:18.32 Like, if you were always someone in your jitter and you'd fight dirty because you want
01:32:18.32 --> 01:32:19.32 to win.
01:32:19.32 --> 01:32:22.16 And you know, do that stuff then when you're done rolling, you tap them out, hell, yeah.
01:32:22.16 --> 01:32:23.76 Everyone's talking about you.
01:32:23.76 --> 01:32:25.72 You dirty, nobody respects you.
01:32:25.72 --> 01:32:27.42 what he likes, even the community.
01:32:27.42 --> 01:32:28.42 Truth.
01:32:28.42 --> 01:32:29.54 You've got to be careful with that.
01:32:29.54 --> 01:32:31.14 I can still.
01:32:31.14 --> 01:32:32.14 All right.
01:32:32.14 --> 01:32:37.20 So how can we win the war that we're all fighting
01:32:37.20 --> 01:32:40.44 kind of on an individual basis day to day?
01:32:40.44 --> 01:32:44.44 With unmitigated daily discipline in all day.
01:32:44.44 --> 01:32:45.04 I like it.
01:32:45.04 --> 01:32:46.04 I like it.
01:32:46.04 --> 01:32:47.48 So when I say daily discipline,
01:32:47.48 --> 01:32:49.32 I mean the energy drink, boom.
01:32:49.32 --> 01:32:51.56 So it's healthy for you.
01:32:51.56 --> 01:32:53.24 And it gives you the payoff that you
01:32:53.24 --> 01:32:56.12 would expect from an energy drink.
01:32:56.12 --> 01:32:58.08 Same same, so this is good news for us.
01:32:58.08 --> 01:33:00.24 Anyway, so on this path that we're all on,
01:33:00.24 --> 01:33:01.92 we need some supplementation.
01:33:01.92 --> 01:33:04.04 We could benefit from supplementation.
01:33:04.04 --> 01:33:08.88 So we got Choco Fuel to the rescue in a sense.
01:33:08.88 --> 01:33:10.48 It's got energy drinks for you healthy.
01:33:10.48 --> 01:33:12.16 Good short term and long term.
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:14.92 We got protein, additional protein.
01:33:14.92 --> 01:33:15.72 Taste real good.
01:33:15.72 --> 01:33:17.04 We got dessert, basically.
01:33:17.04 --> 01:33:17.88 dessert.
01:33:17.88 --> 01:33:18.24 That's good for you.
01:33:18.24 --> 01:33:20.76 Yeah, good short term, good long term.
01:33:20.76 --> 01:33:24.48 The aftermath of the bulk of the protein, the dessert.
01:33:24.48 --> 01:33:25.40 It's good out from that.
01:33:25.40 --> 01:33:27.60 That's a peaceful truth.
01:33:27.60 --> 01:33:29.32 It's a peaceful truth.
01:33:29.32 --> 01:33:30.80 Yes, sir.
01:33:30.80 --> 01:33:34.48 Also, when you drink sacked up, when you immunity acts up,
01:33:34.48 --> 01:33:35.76 we got some stuff for that as well.
01:33:35.76 --> 01:33:37.68 How about you don't let your joints act up?
01:33:37.68 --> 01:33:39.72 How about we get into a continual state of peace
01:33:39.72 --> 01:33:40.36 with our joints?
01:33:40.36 --> 01:33:40.84 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:33:40.84 --> 01:33:41.84 That's what I think.
01:33:41.84 --> 01:33:42.84 That's what I think.
01:33:42.84 --> 01:33:46.000 Because to wait, wait for your joints to act up as a bad call.
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.64 And I was about to say, preemptive strike on your joints.
01:33:48.64 --> 01:33:49.48 Yeah.
01:33:49.48 --> 01:33:51.68 Yeah, I mean, you're like, hey, but a cooperative, you know,
01:33:51.68 --> 01:33:54.28 you're going down like the right path there.
01:33:54.28 --> 01:33:55.52 I'm like preemptive strike.
01:33:55.52 --> 01:33:58.68 Yeah, you see you're joining more for tune with the hang on.
01:33:58.68 --> 01:34:00.96 Marine Corps recording for poster out of the state.
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:02.44 It is called joint warfare.
01:34:02.44 --> 01:34:03.60 I mean, it's called joint warfare.
01:34:03.60 --> 01:34:08.000 No, but preemptive strike on joint issues.
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.88 So in issues, yeah, you have to beat them down.
01:34:09.88 --> 01:34:10.80 Demand this submission.
01:34:10.80 --> 01:34:11.80 Yes.
01:34:11.80 --> 01:34:16.36 Be inflammation and to submission with joint warfare.
01:34:16.36 --> 01:34:20.80 Don't wait until you have joint issues that's a dumb call.
01:34:20.80 --> 01:34:23.12 That's what echo Charles just told you to do.
01:34:23.12 --> 01:34:25.12 I'm here to help.
01:34:25.12 --> 01:34:29.44 You know, I'm saying, hey, if you don't want to worry about joint issues,
01:34:29.44 --> 01:34:31.68 you take the joint warfare and the super-cruit oil.
01:34:31.68 --> 01:34:32.68 Yes.
01:34:32.68 --> 01:34:33.68 That's it.
01:34:33.68 --> 01:34:38.32 If you don't want to worry about colds or sicknesses or fluees or whatever,
01:34:38.32 --> 01:34:39.48 you take the vitamin D3.
01:34:39.48 --> 01:34:40.28 You take the cold war.
01:34:40.28 --> 01:34:41.28 That's going to help you.
01:34:41.28 --> 01:34:42.28 Yeah.
01:34:42.28 --> 01:34:43.28 Preemptive strike.
01:34:43.28 --> 01:34:44.28 Preemptive strike.
01:34:44.28 --> 01:34:45.28 Go to war.
01:34:45.28 --> 01:34:46.28 Yeah.
01:34:46.28 --> 01:34:47.28 Fully.
01:34:47.28 --> 01:34:50.04 So you can get all the stuff at vitamin Chum.
01:34:50.04 --> 01:34:55.92 You can get all the energy drinks at Wawa and you can get all of everything on Jocca
01:34:55.92 --> 01:34:58.000 Fuel.com.
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.76 And if you look, if you want to save a little bit of money and you want to save brain
01:35:02.76 --> 01:35:05.68 power, get a subscription.
01:35:05.68 --> 01:35:07.000 Get a subscription to whatever you want.
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000 It'll show up at your house once a month.
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.32 Boom, there's the milk, there's the joint warfare, there's the super-cruit oil.
01:35:13.32 --> 01:35:14.32 It's coming in.
01:35:14.32 --> 01:35:16.60 When you're worried about it, you can focus on something else.
01:35:16.60 --> 01:35:19.40 You can prioritize next to you some other tasks.
01:35:19.40 --> 01:35:20.40 Yep.
01:35:20.40 --> 01:35:22.40 Speaking of brain power, origin USA.
01:35:22.40 --> 01:35:24.64 They got some American-made stuff.
01:35:24.64 --> 01:35:25.84 How's that enough to do with brain power?
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:26.84 Right.
01:35:26.84 --> 01:35:27.84 You know what I'm talking about?
01:35:27.84 --> 01:35:28.84 Don't act like you don't know.
01:35:28.84 --> 01:35:31.72 American-American-made denim is for as jeans go.
01:35:31.72 --> 01:35:35.08 I was going to call you in a couple of those last-pond cast where you know, speaking
01:35:35.08 --> 01:35:36.08 of whatever.
01:35:36.08 --> 01:35:37.56 I'm going to talk about something totally different.
01:35:37.56 --> 01:35:39.20 That's sort of like become your new mode.
01:35:39.20 --> 01:35:41.24 No, yeah, because you got to make the association.
01:35:41.24 --> 01:35:42.24 Same thing.
01:35:42.24 --> 01:35:43.24 Speaking of pickles.
01:35:43.24 --> 01:35:44.24 That's the brain power.
01:35:44.24 --> 01:35:45.24 Origin USA.
01:35:45.24 --> 01:35:48.20 You can get some jeans.
01:35:48.20 --> 01:35:50.20 American-made denim.
01:35:50.20 --> 01:35:51.20 That's a big deal.
01:35:51.20 --> 01:35:55.04 As far as American-made stuff goes, you got the denim, you got your jeans, you got your
01:35:55.04 --> 01:36:01.92 geese rash guards, you got athletic wear, you got belts, you got boots, all made in America
01:36:01.92 --> 01:36:02.92 or a gen USA.
01:36:02.92 --> 01:36:03.92 Boom.
01:36:03.92 --> 01:36:04.92 See?
01:36:04.92 --> 01:36:06.92 See what I'm saying about the brain power?
01:36:06.92 --> 01:36:09.92 Yeah, that was definitely had a lot to do with brain power.
01:36:09.92 --> 01:36:13.20 Also speaking of a lot of brain power, you're expended.
01:36:13.20 --> 01:36:14.20 Making that connection.
01:36:14.20 --> 01:36:15.20 Speaking of ridiculous.
01:36:15.20 --> 01:36:19.20 Speaking of ridiculous, Joko has a store.
01:36:19.20 --> 01:36:20.20 Half a watt.
01:36:20.20 --> 01:36:23.28 It's called Joko Store.
01:36:23.28 --> 01:36:26.32 If you want your discipline equals freedom, shirts.
01:36:26.32 --> 01:36:27.32 Right.
01:36:27.32 --> 01:36:28.32 Merch.
01:36:28.32 --> 01:36:29.32 As far as merch goes.
01:36:29.32 --> 01:36:31.56 You're sure this does good on it.
01:36:31.56 --> 01:36:32.56 Boom, you can get it there.
01:36:32.56 --> 01:36:33.56 You can get all kinds of stuff.
01:36:33.56 --> 01:36:34.56 Uh, hats.
01:36:34.56 --> 01:36:35.56 Sure.
01:36:35.56 --> 01:36:36.56 So that's pretty good.
01:36:36.56 --> 01:36:37.56 These are the cards.
01:36:37.56 --> 01:36:39.12 Still, so the shirt was your heart on it.
01:36:39.12 --> 01:36:41.64 Do you still sell the shirt with your head on it?
01:36:41.64 --> 01:36:42.64 You design that shirt.
01:36:42.64 --> 01:36:44.92 Just still sell that shirt with your head on it.
01:36:44.92 --> 01:36:46.32 Yeah, we still sell it.
01:36:46.32 --> 01:36:47.32 Cool.
01:36:47.32 --> 01:36:48.32 Best seller.
01:36:48.32 --> 01:36:49.32 Really?
01:36:49.32 --> 01:36:50.32 Yes.
01:36:50.32 --> 01:36:54.60 It sells double the amount of the one with your head on it.
01:36:54.60 --> 01:36:55.60 If you must.
01:36:55.60 --> 01:36:56.60 No.
01:36:56.60 --> 01:37:01.000 Nonetheless, yes, the shirt that Joko designed with my head is on it on there.
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000 Bang.
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.24 A bunch of other stuff on there as well.
01:37:03.24 --> 01:37:05.20 We have a subscription situation for the shirt.
01:37:05.20 --> 01:37:06.20 Some other shirts.
01:37:06.20 --> 01:37:07.20 They're exclusive.
01:37:07.20 --> 01:37:08.20 I said it.
01:37:08.20 --> 01:37:09.20 Exclusive.
01:37:09.20 --> 01:37:10.20 Okay.
01:37:10.20 --> 01:37:11.20 It's called the shirt locker.
01:37:11.20 --> 01:37:13.56 You have, you get one of these shirts every month.
01:37:13.56 --> 01:37:17.68 It's a new, they're new, kind of creative for lack of a better term.
01:37:17.68 --> 01:37:19.32 Designs.
01:37:19.32 --> 01:37:21.24 If you're not part of the shirt locker, you don't get them.
01:37:21.24 --> 01:37:22.24 Sorry.
01:37:22.24 --> 01:37:23.96 It's like the nature of the locker.
01:37:23.96 --> 01:37:24.96 You see?
01:37:24.96 --> 01:37:25.96 Okay.
01:37:25.96 --> 01:37:27.76 You in a little more simple this time, which was good.
01:37:27.76 --> 01:37:30.32 I appreciate it this simplicity of it.
01:37:30.32 --> 01:37:35.72 You still can't describe what the shirts are with any, with any sensible.
01:37:35.72 --> 01:37:36.72 Yeah.
01:37:36.72 --> 01:37:39.96 Well, some things can't be explained.
01:37:39.96 --> 01:37:40.96 That's even better.
01:37:40.96 --> 01:37:41.96 That's even better.
01:37:41.96 --> 01:37:42.96 I like that.
01:37:42.96 --> 01:37:43.96 Yeah.
01:37:43.96 --> 01:37:46.80 Even to say, look, I can't really explain this, but trust me, you're going to want one
01:37:46.80 --> 01:37:47.80 of these shirts.
01:37:47.80 --> 01:37:48.80 Okay.
01:37:48.80 --> 01:37:49.80 These shirts cannot be explained Joko.
01:37:49.80 --> 01:37:51.80 They can only be experienced.
01:37:51.80 --> 01:37:52.80 Bang.
01:37:52.80 --> 01:37:57.12 So you make this choice whether or not you experience it by you wearing them or by
01:37:57.12 --> 01:37:58.68 you seeing someone else wearing them.
01:37:58.68 --> 01:37:59.68 That's up to you.
01:37:59.68 --> 01:38:00.68 That part is up to you.
01:38:00.68 --> 01:38:01.68 It's so low.
01:38:01.68 --> 01:38:02.68 Yeah.
01:38:02.68 --> 01:38:06.68 Thank you for either regret what you have done or what you have not done.
01:38:06.68 --> 01:38:07.68 Yeah.
01:38:07.68 --> 01:38:10.92 I think so too.
01:38:10.92 --> 01:38:12.72 You see somebody representing in a shirt.
01:38:12.72 --> 01:38:13.72 We like, well, that's cool.
01:38:13.72 --> 01:38:14.72 I'm going to pick one of those up, but you can't.
01:38:14.72 --> 01:38:15.72 It's true.
01:38:15.72 --> 01:38:16.72 Yeah.
01:38:16.72 --> 01:38:17.96 That's what the field is telling me is for his feet that goes.
01:38:17.96 --> 01:38:18.96 So yeah, I did.
01:38:18.96 --> 01:38:19.96 They're fueled.
01:38:19.96 --> 01:38:20.96 They're fueled.
01:38:20.96 --> 01:38:21.96 They're fueled.
01:38:21.96 --> 01:38:22.96 Check this out.
01:38:22.96 --> 01:38:24.96 I feel.
01:38:24.96 --> 01:38:27.92 Anyway, like I said, JokoStore.com.
01:38:27.92 --> 01:38:30.60 That's where you can get this cool stuff.
01:38:30.60 --> 01:38:31.60 Speaking of cool stuff.
01:38:31.60 --> 01:38:32.60 Yeah.
01:38:32.60 --> 01:38:34.60 You can describe this for the guests.
01:38:34.60 --> 01:38:39.76 If you want to, because Ecos seems to think that you have in the subscribe to it,
01:38:39.76 --> 01:38:44.000 yeah, because you've been listening to 285 episodes.
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.36 287 episodes.

01:38:51.36 --> 01:38:54.24 And we whip out my iPhone and just hit subscribe.
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:57.36 Smash the subscribe button button.
01:38:57.36 --> 01:38:58.36 Button.
01:38:58.36 --> 01:38:59.36 Button.
01:38:59.36 --> 01:39:00.36 But yeah.
01:39:00.36 --> 01:39:02.28 So anyways, we got this podcast.
01:39:02.28 --> 01:39:09.24 We got the Joko on Ravling podcast with DC, Dero Cooper of Marter Made Fame.
01:39:09.24 --> 01:39:10.72 We got the grounded podcast.
01:39:10.72 --> 01:39:12.28 We got the Warrior Kid podcast.
01:39:12.28 --> 01:39:20.64 We also have Joko underground where we have a sovereign location, a virtual sovereign
01:39:20.64 --> 01:39:28.80 location where we will not be impeded upon by forces.
01:39:28.80 --> 01:39:32.80 So we will do what we want in the Joko underground look.
01:39:32.80 --> 01:39:34.92 Hey, here's what's going on in the world.
01:39:34.92 --> 01:39:37.44 There's things happening on these platforms.
01:39:37.44 --> 01:39:38.88 There's things happening in these platforms.
01:39:38.88 --> 01:39:40.36 We don't control the platforms.
01:39:40.36 --> 01:39:41.36 We don't control the platforms.
01:39:41.36 --> 01:39:46.16 There's a possibility that things could happen that could hurt what we're trying to
01:39:46.16 --> 01:39:47.72 do.
01:39:47.72 --> 01:39:52.84 Whether they start charging you money to listen on these platforms.
01:39:52.84 --> 01:39:57.96 Whether they start inserting advertisements into the middle of us talking about World
01:39:57.96 --> 01:40:04.96 War I or Vietnam and all of a sudden you're listening to an advertisement about what
01:40:04.96 --> 01:40:05.96 that's what it is.
01:40:05.96 --> 01:40:06.96 Mattresses.
01:40:06.96 --> 01:40:09.64 We don't want to have that happen.
01:40:09.64 --> 01:40:14.80 We definitely don't want to be censored for whatever reason.
01:40:14.80 --> 01:40:16.60 So we got to have an alternative platform.
01:40:16.60 --> 01:40:20.20 We made our own Joko underground.com.
01:40:20.20 --> 01:40:22.48 Look, we hopefully we never have to go to it.
01:40:22.48 --> 01:40:24.60 It's possible.
01:40:24.60 --> 01:40:28.76 If we do, we'll be ready and we appreciate the support to get us ready.
01:40:28.76 --> 01:40:34.04 If you want to subscribe to that, we do it a little extra podcast.

01:40:35.36 --> 01:40:37.36 We give some amplifying information.
01:40:37.36 --> 01:40:41.64 If you want to join it, cost $8.18 a month.
01:40:41.64 --> 01:40:43.60 If you can't afford that, it's cool.
01:40:43.60 --> 01:40:46.36 Email assistance at jokowinderground.com.

01:41:17.80 --> 01:41:19.52 Like and subscribe, that's what it is.

01:41:26.08 --> 01:41:27.20 Yeah, let me know in the comments.
01:41:27.20 --> 01:41:29.52 They always have some dumb thing to talk about.
01:41:29.52 --> 01:41:30.92 Yes, you know.
01:41:30.92 --> 01:41:31.92 Most of it.
01:41:31.92 --> 01:41:32.92 Yeah, you know what I was thinking.
01:41:32.92 --> 01:41:35.80 I was, if you want to see more videos like this could make, let me know in the comments.
01:41:35.80 --> 01:41:36.80 Shut up, bro.
01:41:36.80 --> 01:41:37.80 We talked about.
01:41:37.80 --> 01:41:38.80 You know what?
01:41:38.80 --> 01:41:42.04 You're, we'll just say, I'm not going to say your salty.
01:41:42.04 --> 01:41:43.04 I'm not going to say that.
01:41:43.04 --> 01:41:44.04 I'm a pernalist.
01:41:44.04 --> 01:41:46.28 Your salty, but that's not what I'm saying.
01:41:46.28 --> 01:41:51.24 The reason that you feel what I think that you're feeling right now about that is because
01:41:51.24 --> 01:41:55.16 it's like, it's super obvious.
01:41:55.16 --> 01:41:59.28 Like what they're doing, they want to like, they want the intel for the algorithm, right?
01:41:59.28 --> 01:42:01.20 The more you want the engagement, right?
01:42:01.20 --> 01:42:03.24 Obviously, they want the comments, they want the likes.
01:42:03.24 --> 01:42:06.36 They want the, because that's for the algorithm so they can rate their video higher.
01:42:06.36 --> 01:42:08.16 So they can, and you, we know that.
01:42:08.16 --> 01:42:09.16 We know that.
01:42:09.16 --> 01:42:10.16 We're not even mad at that.
01:42:10.16 --> 01:42:11.16 Really kind of mad at that.
01:42:11.16 --> 01:42:15.80 But they're known, but I think we, or you are mad, quote unquote, at the part where
01:42:15.80 --> 01:42:18.48 they try to fake like that's not it.
01:42:18.48 --> 01:42:20.68 They try to fake like, oh yeah, you let me know all it.
01:42:20.68 --> 01:42:23.16 You know, you, you know, we're just going to be each other.
01:42:23.16 --> 01:42:28.88 We're friends almost kind of a feeling and you're like, you don't want to know what I think,
01:42:28.88 --> 01:42:30.36 you know, that's what it feels like.
01:42:30.36 --> 01:42:31.36 I can't read the guys mind.
01:42:31.36 --> 01:42:33.96 So I don't know if you really want to know or not, but that's how it feels.
01:42:33.96 --> 01:42:35.48 That's why I feel it too.
01:42:35.48 --> 01:42:42.92 Well, I'm, I don't say in the videos like comment, but I read the comments because
01:42:42.92 --> 01:42:43.92 they're funny.
01:42:43.92 --> 01:42:44.92 They're funny.
01:42:44.92 --> 01:42:45.92 And they're good.
01:42:45.92 --> 01:42:46.92 And some of them aren't interesting.
01:42:46.92 --> 01:42:47.92 Yeah.
01:42:47.92 --> 01:42:51.60 Some good tips on books to cover and stuff from YouTube comments.
01:42:51.60 --> 01:42:53.000 Literally, that's kind of crazy, right?
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000 Yeah.
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.72 So I'll read the comments because they're interesting.
01:42:56.72 --> 01:42:58.28 They're funny.
01:42:58.28 --> 01:43:04.04 Yeah, YouTube comments kind of have a reputation on that kind of straight up YouTube comments
01:43:04.04 --> 01:43:11.20 have the rep, the stigma of being like a cesspool of just like unreasonable negativity.
01:43:11.20 --> 01:43:16.92 But I think usually with our stuff, they can be constructive most of the time.
01:43:16.92 --> 01:43:17.76 I'm down.
01:43:17.76 --> 01:43:22.52 So if you want to leave a comment, leave a comment, like subscribe smash.
01:43:22.52 --> 01:43:27.44 Anyway, yes, the point is we do have YouTube channel.
01:43:27.44 --> 01:43:29.40 So if you want to look at that, but there you go.
01:43:29.40 --> 01:43:31.92 Also, psychological warfare is an album that Jockel did.
01:43:31.92 --> 01:43:35.64 I recorded back in the day for the purpose of the other.
01:43:35.64 --> 01:43:37.64 Yeah, very hard.
01:43:37.64 --> 01:43:38.64 No, man, it was helpful.
01:43:38.64 --> 01:43:41.48 It was a very, literally press record.
01:43:41.48 --> 01:43:42.48 Right.
01:43:42.48 --> 01:43:43.48 That's what recording is.
01:43:43.48 --> 01:43:44.48 You press record on the thing.
01:43:44.48 --> 01:43:47.000 You think everybody's like super pumped on that?
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000 I think they're very impressed.
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000 Yeah.
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.72 Nonetheless, okay, the for you was recorded for the purpose of helping me through my moments
01:43:53.72 --> 01:43:54.72 of weakness.
01:43:54.72 --> 01:43:58.68 Then we added some other stuff about weaknesses that I don't have, but that other people
01:43:58.68 --> 01:44:01.32 might have, which turned out to be the case.
01:44:01.32 --> 01:44:04.56 So yeah, if you have some moments of weakness, you're listening to Jockel telling you how
01:44:04.56 --> 01:44:08.16 to get over on bones, psychological warfare.
01:44:08.16 --> 01:44:13.44 If you want to see a visual representation of how to stay on the path, go to flipsidecampus.com,
01:44:13.44 --> 01:44:15.72 Dakota Meyer, his company.
01:44:15.72 --> 01:44:20.76 He's putting all stuff kind of cool stuff to hang on your wall and plus is Dakota Meyer,
01:44:20.76 --> 01:44:24.12 which is just, well, it's Dakota Meyer.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.32 Just your ends to your means.
