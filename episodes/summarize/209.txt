Well one because it's made America You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you put that number one because there's some people that say number one It's the best functionality Just strength he's what mom was a Vietnamese well, there's think of all the American you know The American Service members that have got wives over the past however many years wives from Japan wives from the Philippines wives from Germany What we know the seal team used to be up in Scotland as much as guys that had wives from Scotland Like you put the eyes in the middle of these places well, they're gonna meet the girls That's what's gonna happen Roger, so so at least they had the fort you know fort thinking to think listen We got a protector guys. You know These guys jump out slack, you know kind of they got their jumpsuits on they grabbed the rigs and they're just kind of hanging out and It seemed to me that the NCOs y'all officers in the junior ranks were all kind of mingling which doesn't happen Typically or ever in a combat company and so I asked our corpile, you know who is who is that and he said the other was the GCP So that was the first time I saw something like something I didn't know about That's why I'm saying hey, I'm glad guys are gonna read this book, but you have to really read it and think about it You have to really try and think about it think about what you're saying Because man we are genetically programmed You're a certain way and that certain way is not always the best way That no exactly and so it's a name I mean the French foreign Legion there's obviously a reason That I've gotten there and life maybe some of my choices weren't the wise as so I need to start learning and you know Using this to my advantage not making the same mistakes all the time did you have like you said it was a captain that pulled you son tattoo. and you make something that will help everyone in the world Stay clean Very true also you we have YouTube channel you're interested in the video version of what we're doing here You're gonna see what Joel looks like You see what Joel looks like if you see what echo looks like in apparently echo Doesn't look like what he sounds like in the on a unlikely event You want to see what it looks like yes. It's just not a real fight has it's different and so the only way to Overcome that as you got it like overcoming that's why you hope the first fight you get in is with a guy that was an NCAA Collegiate wrestler or Golden Gloves boxer because You won't learn much you won't learn much you'll learn that you don't know anything Whereas if the first fight you get in is getting some drunk guy that's you know acting like an idiot who doesn't know how to fight cool Yeah, and what about like they like you mentioned earlier that the less of the Eastern block Guys would deserve because they're just used to a harsher lifestyle It seems like if I was an Eastern block guy and now I'm getting I think you say the pay is like 1200 bucks and a lot of something like that. cool listen my podcast it's seven hundred hours or whatever I can't it's not specific enough now there's lessons in all of them so EF online let's take the lessons Condense them now distilled them down so people can go through them in a timely fashion eight hours 10 hours of all-mind training where you're actually the other thing is that the podcast I know it feels like it might be interactive you might feel like you're sitting In between me and echo Right now listening maybe you want to chime in and tell echo like to make those excerpts a little bit shorter You probably aren't thinking that But you can't really interact with us Except for on the inner website. it's hard to even fathom that It's hard to fathom that I mean it's hard to fathom that like in America right thinking that the hundred and first airborne division Was gonna say okay, you know what we're gonna drop We're gonna do a parachute drop in deadwashing in DC when it take the White House and we're gonna get rid of the president I mean, that's that's what that's what there is basically exactly what this is doing what we're saying here Probably know you haven't So gaining to know other people's perspective or looking at things from other people's perspective is an important tool and what you're saying here You know focusing on human errors like people are gonna make mistakes. There's more aspects to it that are more similar to boot camp like you got to fill out a chip to go to To go on liberty or something like that, but this is leaning towards boot camp I mean this is like you know this is definitely then like a range of regiment range of regiment Yeah, sure just you know sure in a couple a little bit Cool in my opinion, please let us know via social media if you think an excerpt should be four minutes or 14 I'll say what I think and we all know what echo things and well I have my my Opinion has been refined recently. Okay, because I announced Delta 68 lightweight jeans with a little bit of stretch in them now The all origin jeans have a little bit of stretch in them, but the are Super comfortable little lightweight because I'm not a person that gets cold legs I know it's weird and I know it's a dichotomy that I want heavyweight Sure heavyweight sweatshirt heavyweight hoodie lightweight jeans, but that's how I am Here I am so check out the jeans and also we got supplements up there Which are important big time especially for longevity long list right true supplements big time to keep you in the game We were definitely weren't eating enough to compensate for the calories you're burning But that was also part of it trying to turn it to the right shape and reference the the deserters I think I mentioned that it seemed like it was more that the brits the Kiwis the Aussies the Western area You know the Non-eastern blockers ever were deserting and I think that's because that's something To have you have the evidies are at home or is Eastern blockers where they're gonna go you know they got no choice I mean obviously That's a rap on a huge part of your life and something that's left a huge impact on you I always remember cleaning out the final bits of my operational gear from my locker loading it into my van and driving off base for the last time and thinking well That was a stuff and I spent well kind of like you spent six years based out of course I spent 18 out of 20 years based in corn auto California and really probably Most of those years in like a span of like three or four buildings that were all right next to each other We went out nothing happened rolled back but even just the the The amount of vision that I had the amount of awareness that I had wasn't as good as it should have been You know, I was like a little bit too amped up and it's like okay, how can Talking about that hopefully guys can take a step back and be like all right cool look. You know I would say like if you're a okay high school athlete you'll be fine Like you don't need to be some superhuman because you just need to be able to do the stuff and then obviously If you got an aptitude towards running you're gonna be better that or opt to towards the obstacle course You're gonna be better at that I slowed right down looking into its parade square and passing The emotions I felt at that exact moment are difficult to explain We drove past checked into our Calvy hotel and spent the rest of the day Swimming at the beach the next morning after some delicious croissants Orange juice and two strong cafe crams for me At one of the citadel cafes we drove to the regiment Parked outside the regiments gates noting the new rep and Sydney a painted on its water tower I asked my kids what they wanted to do Visit the regiment or go snorkeling at the beach Perhaps they could sense the answer I was looking for the rep was in my past and the regiment was busy doing real work My focus now was on my son Carter and daughter Kyle and snorkeling Showed to Carter and co long live the Legion And that's how you wrap it up and I thought that that was that idea of Yeah, long live the Legion but at the same time you got your new focus now Which is your son and your daughter and I thought that that's a a lot of people have a hard time doing that Shifting their focus from their past to their present and then to their future It's my fault so right now what I'm trying to do is explain to you that if you don't order it you won't get it and then If you do order it life will be good Leader substratages and tactics field manual we got the way the warrior kid books three two and one all out Teach your kids how to stay on the path we got the Mikey and the dragons If you want your kids to learn the most basic Foundational thing that they need to know as a kid how to overcome fear they can learn it right there Mikey and the dragons incredible feedback on that book all the time it is not rare That a grown human male or female Crys while reading that book you you had an emotional first Wasn't it it wasn't an outburst but wait your brother Jj was something was it your brother J Charles that Yeah, as you did worried about what the enemy was gonna do And I think when it's of soldiering, I don't know if that term even exists, but you got to think about you know the mistakes that others are gonna make not not just the enemy that's kind of the the early onset to Apel is a young man trying to figure out what he's capable of and who he is now It's weird to that you know you had your dad was a who's he say he was a full-karner like Retentic on a retired like some kids that are grow up in that atmosphere They become kind of on the straight narrow path and you know what I mean See and you just in a way is kind of the opposite of what we'd regard like stress like People gonna do it to release stress, but technically that's not what stress is like stress is just basically a sort of like Yeah You know the navy does that the navy has the navy can put you on bread and water Like it niss like right now There's some probably someone right now that's on bread and water for yeah, so doing something That's why I tried to get into that when I mentioned because as we say you know where young men you join There's certain things that you don't necessarily think about when you go there like oh, you know I want to join Legion be a soldier, but you're young men you got other objectives to at the end of the day and And that's why these you know what I've said before is like I think police should should train one one fifth of the time like a won't 20% of the time they should be training So five days at work cool one of those days you're just going through eight hours of training That and who would you rather have policing your neighborhood? everything's new But soldier at least some learning the trade and that's part of You know becoming a soldier and growing as a young man is You know you think okay, I want to be a soldier and you got these visions of things that you will be doing or want to do But life will check that and show you what you're you're made of and what you're capable of and that's what I'm I'm seeing What I'm made of what I'm capable of some of it's good some of this bad but growing up is learning and taking with that Or with from that what you can and are you just completely stoked at this point though? I'll be it you know, maybe my reaction wasn't textbook, but whatever and result was Successful and you know once once once you're once you're part of a little something then you're you gain that a little bit of traction with the team They start to know what you're made of and then continues on Yeah, that's good It has tracks Where whatever moment of weakness you are experiencing I will personally come through your headphones and help you overcome that moment of weakness by Speaking words into your ears and telling you to stay on the path And don't forget if you need a Visual representation of the path and a reminder to stay on it check out flip side-cam this dot com Which is run by my brother the code of mine where he makes things That are sometimes referred to as graphic art and you can hang them on your walls and they say things like good Or get after it or discipline equals freedom or you can tell the code of what you want As far as books go first of all the book that we covered today a pel Canadian in the French foreign Legion by Joel Strothers awesome book very cool I left out so many Good stories obviously, but it's a great book so you can pick that up click through the Amazon link also we got leadership strategy and tactic field manual Which you can actually order Now and you should order now because If you don't win it finally gets released you go. So it's almost like she had an emotional out Kind of like the jockel weight tea so good actually just so happens that I got the new shipment in So she might have been out of the game for a little bit you seem saying and then she gets you revisited it and then was like Had that I got to say it is refreshing the cans refreshing More refreshing remember when you were a kid and you drink gatorade? Here's the thing me saying emotional outbursts is like it's kind of misleading like you know when you think of your emotional I'll press it's like a bad thing almost So I finished a finished first And hats off to I mentioned Benny he was an ex British soldier served in Over in Ireland a good guy and he was my you know go to during training You know he had his History and stories and he had a bad knee so he decided at the end of your basic training You can decide to Call a quits and he did and we had a you know and I'm sure I'll go into at some point in Legion air, but that warred Algeria was vicious Yep, and it was a True like counter-insurgency going on and there was a lot of you know, there was there was The insertion tactics of you know booby traps and I E.Ds and things like that it was brutal. Yeah, and you just said You said you just said I didn't win which is which is like you're not gonna win that situation And that takes a that takes a little bit of insight to understand hey you can stand up You can bow up you can act like a tough guy you could even beat the shit out of him, right?
