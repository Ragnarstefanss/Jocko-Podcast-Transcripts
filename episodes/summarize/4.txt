It's like, if you play it, like if you were just playing it, you didn't know Jockel, you know, you'd be like, oh, this kind of a cool little, you know, um, like a kind of folksy kind of catchy. I also do think that some people that go psycho with yoga and stretching can actually do more damage than good, you know, I've known, I knew some guys along the way that got really into yoga and as a years went on, I think it was debilitating for them, you know, you're, you're spine and your muscles are supposed to stretch to a certain point and when you start stretching them beyond that, you used to, in my opinion, you start doing more on the good. And when I looked it up, just to kind of clarify, you know, the closest thing that I think he's talking about is it gives you ideas, it gives you feelings, you know, war gives you these deep feelings, and it's trying to prepare men psychologically for what they're going to face because it's going to be deep. So if you're a jujitsu guy, the best way to train is jujitsu and that goes for conditioning and stuff is jujitsu based conditioning, but so like if you're like, if you're in the guard, the close guard and you're trying to hold a close guard and you're training five, even five days a week, you're energized, you're at, you know, abductors, abductors, are going to get a lot of training. But, you know, that being said, you know, in a, you know, in a society it was a very constant pressure like that. You know, isn't it important, especially, you know, for being a jujitsu guy, you know. I'm going to get, you know, and some people will take that with a negative tone and say, you know what, that guy doesn't even see what I do. You know, I, I, in GJDs who, when I'm teaching people in GJDs who, and you know, you get some, somebody will say, oh, I'm going to tap you out one day. And as you listen to this, think about the people you know that people that you work with, and these three people exist everywhere. And they're just machines that go on, you know, life and I have been quoted saying this many times because people ask us and say, well, you were in charge of seals and those guys, you know, they do whatever you say. So I do that, you know, mobility, mobility, what with Kelly Starat and his book, the supple leopard and you know, I have that and when I have something going on, I'll dig into that book or dig into those videos and find out what I need to do to grind that problem out. You know, I was just imitating what they did and trying to, I didn't, you know, I can't remember that many times where someone sat me down and said, all right, so here's what you need to do to win. You know, I think a lot of people with, we get asked a lot about doing tasks and how do you get stuff done every day. And for me personally, you know, I mean, and, and, you know, there's a lot of guys that didn't come back that didn't, don't have the opportunity to get up early. When people ask us about in civilian companies, you know, it's different because it's not combat and we say combat is like life. So immediately, I feel, I feel guilty, you know, because I, the guilt is because I know I missed a great part of my day. Your workout put isn't, you know, as as as much as this next guy, you know, this guy, what's wrong with you? I can't even fathom what that was like, you know, knowing just what a little bit of it feels like a little tiny, tiny fraction of it.
