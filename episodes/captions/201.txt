[00:00:00] This is Jocopontcast number 201.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jocca Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening, I go good evening.
[00:00:12] I had left my daughter Maggie with my parents
[00:00:15] while I and my business partner drove a few minutes away
[00:00:19] to look at a vacant store right in the heart of town.
[00:00:22] As soon as I saw it, I knew it would be perfect.
[00:00:26] As the landlord was putting the lease in my hand from me to sign,
[00:00:29] myself on rang.
[00:00:31] And I saw it was my mom.
[00:00:33] Thinking she was just checking to see when I would be back,
[00:00:37] I ignored the call.
[00:00:40] When my phone immediately rang again,
[00:00:43] I knew something was up.
[00:00:45] My initial fear was that something happened to my 10-month-old daughter.
[00:00:50] My mind went to the worst place and at the time,
[00:00:54] I didn't think anything could be worse than that.
[00:00:56] When I answered the phone,
[00:00:59] all I heard on the other end were muffled screams.
[00:01:04] It was clearly a noise made by someone who was so broken up
[00:01:08] and in such a state of shock that he or she couldn't even cry properly.
[00:01:16] I didn't know how to prepare myself for whatever news I was about to receive,
[00:01:20] I started shaking uncontrollably.
[00:01:23] Tell me what happened, I cried.
[00:01:25] I was terrified that something horrible had happened to Maggie.
[00:01:31] Had she tripped and split open her head,
[00:01:34] choked on something, my mind was running wild with possibilities.
[00:01:37] Not knowing was almost worse than knowing at this point.
[00:01:41] Have you called an ambulance I yelled?
[00:01:44] Yes, answered the voice on the other phone.
[00:01:47] Before the line suddenly went dead.
[00:01:50] I knew that I was too upset to drive.
[00:01:53] I asked my business partner to take me home.
[00:01:55] A five-minute drive I had traveled countless times before,
[00:01:58] but this time those five minutes felt like an eternity.
[00:02:03] And while the car was crawling through the streets,
[00:02:05] my mind was racing at 1,000 miles a minute.
[00:02:07] My husband wasn't work about an hour away.
[00:02:10] While I wanted the comfort that his voice would bring,
[00:02:13] I decided not to call him until I got home to the house
[00:02:17] and could figure out what was going on.
[00:02:20] I didn't want to upset him if I didn't have to.
[00:02:22] As we pulled onto my parent's street,
[00:02:24] my heart started racing as fast as my mind.
[00:02:28] I didn't see an ambulance anywhere inside.
[00:02:31] For a moment that gave me a sense of relief.
[00:02:33] Maybe things weren't as serious as I had led myself to believe.
[00:02:38] My dad was standing in the driveway next to a friend.
[00:02:42] Lieutenant Colonel Korky Gardner.
[00:02:46] He and my father had served together in the Marine Corps.
[00:02:48] And he was a deer friend of the family.
[00:02:54] He and his wife lived about 45 minutes away,
[00:02:56] so it struck me as odd to see him standing there.
[00:02:59] Especially since my parents had not mentioned he would be coming over.
[00:03:06] I jumped out of the car while it was still moving.
[00:03:08] Where's the ambulance I screamed?
[00:03:10] My dad stared back at me with a blank look.
[00:03:20] Then in a very measured tone, he said,
[00:03:26] Travis was killed.
[00:03:30] I heard those words loud and clear,
[00:03:32] but they didn't make any sense to me.
[00:03:35] It took me a few seconds to process what I was being told.
[00:03:38] Since the moment I hung up the phone,
[00:03:41] I'd known something was wrong,
[00:03:42] but this was far worse than anything I could have imagined.
[00:03:46] I thought my daughter was an imminent danger.
[00:03:48] And here I was being told that my brother was dead.
[00:03:55] He was 26 years old.
[00:03:57] And that right there is an excerpt from a book called The Knock at the Door.
[00:04:09] Three gold star families bonded by grief and purpose.
[00:04:14] And this book is written by Ryan Manion,
[00:04:18] who wrote that opening section,
[00:04:20] who is the sister of US Marine First Lieutenant Travis Manion,
[00:04:24] who is killed in Iraq, is also written by Amy Looney,
[00:04:29] Hefferman, the surviving spouse of Lieutenant Brendan Looney,
[00:04:34] a seal officer killed in Afghanistan,
[00:04:37] and the other author, the final author, is Heather Kelly,
[00:04:43] the surviving spouse of First Lieutenant Robert Kelly,
[00:04:48] a Marine Corps officer, also killed in Afghanistan, and you may recognize these names,
[00:04:58] because I've talked about all these names on this podcast.
[00:05:04] I read a speech on podcast, number 162 about two brave Marines, Jonathan Yale,
[00:05:12] and Jordan Herder, who held the line at an outpost
[00:05:16] while being attacked by a vehicle born bomb,
[00:05:20] and these two brave Marines stood their ground and stopped the vehicle before
[00:05:23] and entered their outpost, and killed many more of their fellow Marines,
[00:05:30] but the bomb did detonate, and it killed both of them.
[00:05:36] And that speech was made by a Marine Corps general, General Kelly.
[00:05:41] Then I mentioned, when I read that speech,
[00:05:47] that General Kelly's son was killed in action,
[00:05:51] and that was, that was First Lieutenant Robert Kelly,
[00:05:56] and then you may have heard me talk about Brendan Looney,
[00:06:00] a seal that I put through training,
[00:06:03] who was loved by his brothers and the teams,
[00:06:07] who was a few days from coming home after a tough deployment in Afghanistan,
[00:06:15] who volunteered to go on a turnover operation,
[00:06:19] and was killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on September 21, 2010,
[00:06:26] and when I talked about him, I spoke a lot about his best friend,
[00:06:32] Travis Mending, and I talked about Travis Mending,
[00:06:34] as well when I had Brian Stan on the podcast.
[00:06:38] Well, Travis Mending was killed in action on April 29, 2007,
[00:06:42] and I went into detail around the relationship between Travis and Brendan,
[00:06:50] who are buried next to each other,
[00:06:52] that are only to national cemetery, when I had Travis's dad on the podcast number 72,
[00:06:59] and we discussed his book, which is called Brothers Forever.
[00:07:07] And this book that I'm reading from today, the knock at the door,
[00:07:13] this gives a different perspective,
[00:07:19] a perspective of pain and of anguish, but also of surviving
[00:07:25] in overcoming and of moving forward through the pain
[00:07:32] and to a place of pride and a place of purpose,
[00:07:36] and it is an honor to have one of the authors of this book with us here today,
[00:07:43] Ryan Mending, sister of Travis Mending, to share some of what she has learned.
[00:07:49] So, Ryan, thank you for coming out here, and thank you for coming on the podcast.
[00:07:56] Yeah, I'm really happy to be here, and happy to talk a little bit more about the book.
[00:08:03] This is a tough way to start off a book.
[00:08:06] Yeah.
[00:08:06] With, I mean, what's got to be the worst day of your life, I'm assuming,
[00:08:12] or at least write up there.
[00:08:13] 100% the worst day of my life, and it's interesting to hear you reading it,
[00:08:22] you become a little dis sensitized when you're putting things on paper,
[00:08:26] and when you talk about it a lot, but to hear you reading it,
[00:08:30] it definitely brought a motion, it's in the way that you read too,
[00:08:35] but it kind of brings you back to that place.
[00:08:39] Well, whenever I read something like this, not only am I thinking about
[00:08:46] what you went through, what your family went through, but I'm also thinking about how many times this
[00:08:52] happened to my friends, my friends, families, and the pain and anguish that this causes.
[00:09:00] And yeah, you titled the book The Knock of the Door, and for anyone that doesn't understand this,
[00:09:11] the military has a very well-defined protocol that they take when a service member is killed
[00:09:21] overseas, and it's a personal notification, which is actually a great thing compared to what
[00:09:29] they used to do, and I don't know if you've ever seen the, what are those little messages that
[00:09:33] they used to send? Yeah, like a telegram message, that's right, it was a telegram, they would send a telegram
[00:09:38] that said, you know, dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith, we're sorry to inform you that your son Barry Smith
[00:09:46] was killed in action around this day, in around this area. So at some point,
[00:09:55] someone smart realized that that was a horrible way to notify families, so they have a very strict
[00:10:01] protocol, and what the protocol consists of is uniformed personnel from the service branch that the
[00:10:08] service member was in, going to the home and knocking on the door in full dress uniform.
[00:10:16] And it's these days what's become challenging about it is it's a race against social media and
[00:10:22] it's a race against the news. So when you have, when you're overseas and one of your troops are killed,
[00:10:29] there's like immediate radio silence, you're not allowed to tell anyone, because it's all to prevent
[00:10:34] the family from finding out that this has happened on the news, and let's face it, even with this
[00:10:40] protocol, which is designed to try and support the family as much as possible. I mean, it's, it's still
[00:10:46] just an absolute, it's just an absolute nightmare, and it's the worst fear of any family. That has a
[00:10:54] service member on an active duty deployed, the worst nightmare for all of us.
[00:11:03] And I think you did a great job of capturing how that, how that impacts. Now, before we go further
[00:11:10] down this story, I want to give a little bit of background between you and Travis, and I
[00:11:16] think it's, it starts to tell the story of of your relationship with him. I'm going to the book here.
[00:11:23] Travis and I had been born only 15 months apart. So to say we were close, we'd be an understatement.
[00:11:28] The fact that ours was a military family also brought us closer than most siblings.
[00:11:33] Like many military families, we had to adjust new situations very quickly until I was 12 when my
[00:11:38] dad left active duty before that we had moved almost every two years. We knew that no matter where
[00:11:44] we moved next, no matter what school we ended up in or which sports teams we'd be on,
[00:11:49] be the new kids on. We always had each other to depend on. Travis had been my built-in best friend
[00:11:57] at every stage of my life. What about the sister brother dynamic? Did you, well, you were older,
[00:12:10] so were you kind of like the, I mean, I was the denominator. I was the older sibling. Yes, there
[00:12:15] is no doubt about that. It was funny. I was having a conversation with someone last night and they
[00:12:20] were asking me about my relationship with Travis and I said, you know, Travis really did look
[00:12:26] up to me and sometimes I didn't fair him well because I was a bit of the wild child and
[00:12:34] you know, I wasn't always listening to my parents and so I could kind of skew him in the wrong
[00:12:40] direction and you know, looking back on things, I look at who my brother was and he was very driven
[00:12:50] even at a young age. There was something different about him and you know, I talk about a little
[00:12:58] bit in the book. Like I felt like at times like what happened to that piece of DNA for me because I didn't
[00:13:03] have that drive. I didn't have that commitment to to goals or anything of that sort. But, you know,
[00:13:09] along with that came this idea that in the way that he was, I admired him so much. It wasn't a
[00:13:17] a jealousy. I wasn't like, oh, you know, there's great Travis or, you know, I was so proud of him
[00:13:23] and I was so proud to have him as my brother. So that's pretty unique. Yeah, I mean, my, I remember
[00:13:29] in high school, my girlfriends and I, we follow him around the Philadelphia area to his wrestling
[00:13:35] matches and we were like his main cheering squad in the front row and I'm like, that's my brother,
[00:13:39] the all-american wrestler, you know, I was so proud of him and it was, it was really cool to
[00:13:45] grow up with someone that even he was younger than me but that I could look up to so much, you know,
[00:13:51] and I think at the end of the day he helped me from not going too far off the rails, you know?
[00:13:58] It's weird and you got three children. I have three children. So I have four children and it's weird
[00:14:03] how an always trying to explain to people that they're going to be different. Oh yeah. You know,
[00:14:07] they're going to be different and you just kind of have to brace yourself as a parent. Which it sounds
[00:14:13] like your parents and to brace themselves for you. Oh, my dad braised himself for many, many years, many,
[00:14:19] many years and you know, growing up, I mean, I, I was an athlete and, um,
[00:14:26] the rest board said you put. I played lacrosse through, you know, I played every sport,
[00:14:31] growing up soccer basketball, everything but I played lacrosse through high school and college.
[00:14:37] And my dad always said, you know, between you and Travis, like you were the born athlete,
[00:14:44] like you had athletic ability, it came naturally to you. Like Travis had to work hard every
[00:14:49] thing he did. Travis played on, um, I remember we moved to Pennsylvania. He played on a CIO football team.
[00:14:55] And he was a short little chubby kid and his nickname was pork chop. And, you know, and
[00:15:04] Travis had to work to become who we became. I glided right through, never worked at anything,
[00:15:11] still got some money to go to school for college and play lacrosse and I look back now and I'm like,
[00:15:15] God, if I don't even apply myself a little bit like and really try to work at something.
[00:15:22] So it's weird that's a, that's a trait, right? Like this work ethic thing. Yeah.
[00:15:27] It's a trait that some people have and some people don't, I don't know, but, uh,
[00:15:33] what's it, I heard a quote, I heard a quote from one of my Brazilian friends and he said,
[00:15:38] there's a, there's a saying in Brazil that there's a reason that God doesn't give wings to a snake
[00:15:47] because if he did, we'd all be screwed because the snakes could just fly around and kill you.
[00:15:52] So that's like what happens, right? You can have that awesome work ethic, but you maybe don't get
[00:15:58] the full athletic capability that is optimal or you can be this really gifted athlete, but, you know,
[00:16:04] you like to party. Yeah. That, that, that pretty much describes it. Yeah. And it's cool that you,
[00:16:14] it's cool that you didn't have this jealousy thing going on, right? Well, I guess you were
[00:16:18] in a accomplished athlete as well. So I guess it really, really wouldn't be there. Yeah, it was that,
[00:16:22] but more than that, it was also like, hey, my parents were so focused on Travis that I could kind of
[00:16:28] slide by with a lot of things. You know, it was like, hey, you know, we're, we're taking Travis to
[00:16:33] Lehigh for the, the nationals for wrestling. I'm like, sweet, I'm going to have a rager at the
[00:16:38] house this weekend. So would you legitimately do that? I legitimately did that. When your parents were
[00:16:43] gone, you would have ragers. Yes, several times. And you, and, and did you ever get caught?
[00:16:50] So I'll tell you a story. It was my brother, senior year, he was going to wrestle at the national
[00:16:55] perhaps. It's, it's huge. I mean, it's the huge, is tournament he's going to wrestle in. And he goes up to,
[00:17:03] he goes up and we, my best friend and I, my mom took us out to breakfast. And she's like, I'm
[00:17:11] taking out to breakfast before they left. They were heading to Lehigh for the weekend.
[00:17:15] And my girlfriend, Kristen, I are sitting there and my mom says, doesn't say to me, she says,
[00:17:20] Kristen, look me in the eye. You are not having a party at my house this weekend. And Kristen said,
[00:17:27] I promise Mrs. Man, and we're not going to have a party. She said to this, this day, it's the,
[00:17:32] like, she's like, I lied to your mom's face. Yes, straight up. I mean, we had, we had the
[00:17:37] pegs being delivered, like, you know, within the hour after they were gone. And the party got a
[00:17:43] little out of control. We were, you know, we had all these upper classmen show up. It was, and I'm like,
[00:17:49] oh my gosh, you got, it got ahead of us. And so finally, we get everybody out. The house is trashed.
[00:17:54] And so, like, my core group of friends were cleaning up the house, we're trying to get everything
[00:17:59] taken care of. And I tell my mom, buddy, there must be 12 bags of trash. And I said, take this trash.
[00:18:05] You're on trash due to get it out of here, get it in a dumpster. So he leaves with the trash. And
[00:18:10] I'm feeling pretty proud. I'm like, I think, I think we can cover this up, you know?
[00:18:14] So my parents come home the next day. And, you know, my mom walks in and she's kind of like looking
[00:18:21] around, like, like, do you have people over here? No, I just pressed and I did this to get her.
[00:18:26] And I'm looking at everything. And we kind of, I'm like, we got away with this. It's about two hours
[00:18:31] later, knock on the door. My mom goes in the answers the door. And there's a lady standing there
[00:18:36] with all 12 bags of trash at the front door. And she's like, these were thrown into the field behind
[00:18:43] my house. She went through the trash, found like, because we had taken out the trash with like mail in it,
[00:18:48] found our dress. And, uh, and I just remember looking at Travis and he just shook his head like
[00:18:54] your such an idiot. I've, uh, when I go away and you know, I got teenage kids now and even
[00:19:01] well, coverman calls now, but I used to go away for whatever with my wife or whatever and leave the
[00:19:06] kids at home. And I'm like, are you guys going to have a rager? Or what? I kind of encouraged them.
[00:19:11] And they were like, no, they're like that. None of our friends will come to our house. They like,
[00:19:16] don't want to come here because of you. Yeah, totally. And I'm like, oh, well, okay, I guess that's
[00:19:21] a positive thing. So that's awesome. You guys had a, had, it's awesome that you didn't have that
[00:19:26] rivalry, which can, which can happen in, in, in a, in a sibling relationships. My kids don't
[00:19:33] really have it either. Now that I think about it, which is cool. What about, like, competition,
[00:19:37] like, even on a more friendly level? Like, did, did you ever feel like you're competing with
[00:19:42] him? Ping pong death matches or anything like that? I mean, listen, you know,
[00:19:46] this in life, I mean, yeah, I mean, growing up, I mean, as when we were young, like, I used to
[00:19:54] tease him endlessly. I mean, my aunt tells the story of her wedding, you know, and, and she said,
[00:20:01] all you did was make Travis cry by teasing him the entire day. We were like 10 and 11 years old. So
[00:20:06] we fought like siblings. But I think by the time we hit high school,
[00:20:12] there really wasn't competition. Like, hey, would I, would we get out back and play basketball?
[00:20:17] And, you know, yeah, that's, that sort of stuff, like, friendly, but like, there was nothing,
[00:20:23] competitive in terms of how our relationship worked.
[00:20:27] Hmm, interesting. Awesome. All right, you, you dive into this a little bit more. I'm going to go to the
[00:20:31] book here on a wooden, wooden beam in our basement by the bench press on which you had
[00:20:35] punished himself nightly. Travis wrote his goals in permanent black marker.
[00:20:41] Here they are all American wrestler, first team all Catholic and lacrosse,
[00:20:46] maintained 3.9 GPA. My aspirations were far more modest,
[00:20:53] rarely recorded and let's be honest, not terribly admirable. While Travis's key performance
[00:20:58] indicators consisted of grade point averages and athletic milestones,
[00:21:02] mind were quantified by number of parties attended or classes skipped without getting caught.
[00:21:09] Travis had a work ethic uncommon amongst most 16 year olds and as his older sister,
[00:21:14] I found it fascinating and a little unnerving. I marveled at Travis's ability to set a goal one year
[00:21:21] out even two years out and then worked tirelessly to meet it. Occasionally, I questioned what
[00:21:26] genetic material was absent from my DNA that caused this quality to skip me, but I never lost
[00:21:32] sleep about it. Though I admired his self-discipline and focus, I'm pretty sure Travis
[00:21:37] envied my vibrant social life and lighthearted attitude towards responsibility.
[00:21:42] So you guys kind of balanced each other out? Totally. Did you, when you were looking at him
[00:21:47] with his goals and everything like that and you're saying, well, that skipped me. Did you ever
[00:21:51] say, well, it didn't skip me. I can make a goal and I can go for it. Did you ever, did you did
[00:21:56] that ever cross your mind or is that just not part of your brain? Yeah, I mean, I have to be honest,
[00:22:01] I just didn't really care. You know, I was, I was happy to take the back seat to his start-up.
[00:22:09] You played the crossing college. I mean, that's no joke. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I broke some school records
[00:22:16] at my playing college lacrosse and you know what? And so I don't want to take away anything from that,
[00:22:22] but it was like, I went to a D3 school, I played lacrosse. I was the leading score on the team
[00:22:30] and it was a lot of fun and you know, and Travis would come to my games. I remember Travis came to
[00:22:35] one of my games and him and my uncle Chris were like heckling the goalie because the goalie had like
[00:22:42] had a cheap shot at me. I played a tack. I was right up front and so they're like standing behind
[00:22:46] heckling the goalie and after the game, you know, we win the game and we're standing there and the coach
[00:22:53] says the coach is like, doesn't directly say anything to me, but she goes, I'm just going to say this
[00:23:00] right now. If I see anybody's family messing with, you know, messing with another team again,
[00:23:07] that's so called player will not be playing on my team anymore. And so I like leaving on my
[00:23:12] thanks a lot guys. You know, you come to one game and you know, I'm about to kick off the team
[00:23:17] for what you're doing. What the hell are they doing? I mean, you've got to make a pretty
[00:23:22] significant impact on the game. Yeah, I mean, there was it was a it was a cheap shot my her
[00:23:28] and what, you know, I shot, she came out and whacked me so hard and an intentional way, you know,
[00:23:35] and that was my brother. Like he was if someone messed with me, like go mess with me. Yeah,
[00:23:42] I mean, if someone messes with you, he's going to hackle them. Yeah, but majorly, yeah, if you're
[00:23:46] growing, you're going to get happy with if you're a guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So you tell a good story and here,
[00:23:51] it's like a Saturday night and there's a party going on and I you have this ideal situation,
[00:23:59] because you got your brother who's kind of a straight and narrow kind of guy. So that means you have
[00:24:03] a designated driver. You invite him to go to this party. The party, you know, it goes gets kind of
[00:24:11] wild and then the cops show up. And so here we go to the book teenagers scattered Travis Krista,
[00:24:17] who's one of the people you're with and I quickly found one another and joined the mad rush
[00:24:21] toward the back of the house. We barreled through the kitchen door, hopped the fence that's
[00:24:24] surrounded the property and sprinted for the woods behind the house. Those woods were our ticket to
[00:24:29] freedom. They also represented a blessed escape from the terrifying wrath of my parents,
[00:24:34] who almost certainly would have disowned me for what would have been my third underage drinking
[00:24:40] citation in my high school career. So you had some milestones you were making. So you're running
[00:24:47] in through the woods. There's a footbridge and somehow you fall off the footbridge, which actually
[00:24:52] the word you're using here, you say I got thrown off the footbridge. Was that even me? Well,
[00:24:56] because there's a hundred kids running over a bridge that's this wide. I'll try and hit that
[00:25:01] same cornfield. So yes, someone pushed off because you're getting to the cornfield and then
[00:25:08] you're good. Yeah. Because they cannot find you in a cornfield. They're not run. The
[00:25:12] concert not chasing us into a cornfield. Cornfields are crazy. Yeah. Like you can get lost in cornfields.
[00:25:18] I have many times. Yeah. All right. So you end up you end up getting thrown from this footbridge
[00:25:24] and you go back to the book. I became aware of a pain coursing through my leg. I looked
[00:25:29] down and saw that my shin was covered in blood. My khaki pens were red. So now,
[00:25:34] Travis is like, hey, we got to get you some help and you guys discussed that a little bit. Finally,
[00:25:39] you are going to walk back to the car and finally the car was with insight. But just as we
[00:25:45] rounded a giant pine tree, a blinding light shown in our eyes busted. Hey kids, get over here.
[00:25:53] A square jawed officer examined us with his flashlight. He wanted names, ages, and a full
[00:25:58] account of our whereabouts that evening. Somewhere in the interrogation session, a light bulb
[00:26:03] seemed to go off in his head. His eyes softened and his lips turned up into a smile. Hey, wait.
[00:26:10] You're Travis, man. Yes, sir. Hello, the wrestling season you've had, kid. Thank you, sir. And so then
[00:26:17] he, you know, Travis kind of plays this thing up to get you guys to get you guys out of
[00:26:24] out of trouble. Yeah. So this is the kind of, this is the kind of thing that you two had going on.
[00:26:28] Yeah, it was, uh, did, uh, did you, since you guys are close in age, did your friends all hang
[00:26:37] out together? Oh, yeah, totally. I mean, my friends were his friends. Did you go out with any of your
[00:26:42] friends? Um, he hung out with some of my friends. Did you go out with any of his friends?
[00:26:47] Little bit. Yeah, no serious relationship. My kids are like, my oldest three kids are
[00:26:53] about 18 to 24 months apart. Yeah. And it's 18 for the first two. And so there's always,
[00:26:59] but the oldest two are girls. And then there's the boy. Yeah. But the weird thing is the boy's like
[00:27:04] six three. And he's always been taller than them since. So I don't know. It's, but there's,
[00:27:09] there's like a little in, there's like a little line with my kids. The friends all hang around,
[00:27:14] but there's never been like a relationship anywhere. Yeah, no. I mean, I'll tell you like in,
[00:27:20] and I think it was my, was my senior year, my senior year. You know, we had, I had one friend who
[00:27:28] didn't get asked to prom. And you know, it was a sad thing, you know, and she's like,
[00:27:33] heartbroken about it. And I'm like Travis, you're, you're taking her to prom. And he's like,
[00:27:38] I know this girl, I'm like, you're taking her prom. He's like, fine. You know, like he always
[00:27:42] just kind of like stepped in. I mean, certainly, a lot of my friends were, um, and that
[00:27:49] I'm never by Travis. I'll put that way. Travis, was this stud? Yeah. All right. So you guys have this awesome
[00:27:56] relationship. And I'm going to go back now to the day you find out. So here we go. I couldn't believe it.
[00:28:08] I didn't want to believe it. I collapsed in a heap right there on the driveway. I remember thinking
[00:28:14] that the asphalt felt a naturally warm for a mid April afternoon that had been mild. It's not fair.
[00:28:20] It's not fair. I screamed over and over into the sky. I wanted to make sure that everyone,
[00:28:25] even got himself knew that he had made a terrible mistake. As I screamed, my parents' neighbors
[00:28:32] spilled out of their houses to find out what was happening. My dad didn't rush to my side to comfort
[00:28:37] me. He let me get those tortured screams out of my system before I went about the hard work
[00:28:44] I'm trying to understand what had happened and pick up the pieces. As it always been the case with
[00:28:49] my dad, he knew exactly what I needed before I did. I have no idea how long I lay on the ground
[00:28:54] screaming. I just know that it was long enough to get the rage out of my system. That's some
[00:29:01] point. One of the neighbors helped me up and walked me down the driveway toward my house. As I walked,
[00:29:07] I turned around and saw an unfamiliar car parked out in front of the house. In my shock,
[00:29:13] I hadn't even noticed it earlier. Inside, sat a young man about my age and full military dress
[00:29:18] blues. His forehead was resting on the top of the steering wheel, pressed between two folded arms
[00:29:25] that cradled his head. His eyes were closed and he looked ejected or perhaps unconscious.
[00:29:33] I later learned this parmarine 26 years old had been charged with the unfortunate task of
[00:29:39] sharing the news with the people closest to Travis that he had been killed in Iraq. Captain
[00:29:44] Eric Kael, as I later learned his name was, had been assigned to carry out the jobs since he was
[00:29:50] local and it graduated from the Naval Academy the year before my brother. Lieutenant Colonel
[00:29:54] Gardner had also been called since the military knew that he was a family friend close by.
[00:30:00] Together while I had been out scouting sites for my boutique, they had approached my parents'
[00:30:06] door and knocked. My mother opened the door, took one look at quirky in the young marine uniform
[00:30:13] and slammed the door in their faces. She simply couldn't face what was on the other side.
[00:30:26] Like I said, that's what every military family knows there's only one reason that that
[00:30:32] person's coming in your house and their dress uniforms. And since your dad was in the Marine
[00:30:38] Corps for whatever 20 something years and she obviously was new. This is good as well as anyone.
[00:30:50] So she wasn't sure she could face what was on the other side. I wasn't sure I could either.
[00:30:57] When I reached the front door with the help of my neighbor, I stopped. I had walked through the
[00:31:01] that door thousands of times before but this time I wanted to turn the other direction and run away.
[00:31:06] I knew deep down in my soul that once I passed through that door this time,
[00:31:12] the life that I had known was over and there was no going back. That permanence, I was
[00:31:38] at the seal teams. I was in the training command and a guy got wounded really bad overseas
[00:31:48] and somebody called me and said, hey, this guy, he got wounded really bad. And I think
[00:31:55] the guys that called the guy, there's two guys on the other end and I think
[00:32:00] they were looking for like a little bit of sympathy. One of the guys got wounded really bad
[00:32:18] and I remember saying, because I had heard the initial report that a guy was going to really
[00:32:22] about really bad and then these guys this call came probably 36 hours later and I said,
[00:32:32] hey, is he stable? And they said, yeah, he's stable and I said, well then we're good.
[00:32:44] And for them, I mean, for them they were still thinking like, hey, this guy's going to lose limbs,
[00:32:51] like this guy's going to be in really bad shape. But for me, like because you know, I only come
[00:32:59] back from Iraq a little while before and lost guys there. Yeah. And so for me, the difference between
[00:33:06] hey, this guy's as messed up as this guy's going to be is horrible. The situation is and the wounds
[00:33:12] that he suffered are horrible, but he's going to be here and this permanence of what you, you know,
[00:33:22] that's what, that's what I was thinking about when I was reading about you saying, when you walk through
[00:33:26] that door, the line between life and death is like, it's like you can't even, you can't even
[00:33:31] identify it so, so slender and it falls on one side or the other. Yeah, you know, I've, I, you know,
[00:33:42] you go through that initial phase of shock, but I remember thinking like, why couldn't he just
[00:33:48] been like, why couldn't we be flying a Germany right now, you know? And I've even had dreams about
[00:33:53] like Travis being there, but he's like super wounded, you know, he's missing both his legs,
[00:34:00] but I'm like, who cares? It's Travis, you know, I, I, of course you take him in any form
[00:34:07] if they're alive, you know, and it's just that idea and I think for me, you know, when my mom
[00:34:14] opened the door, it's, I don't, I don't write about it in the book, but like it was a super volatile
[00:34:21] time when he was there. And my mom had gotten an email a week before from the Major's wife on the
[00:34:30] mid team and she had, you know, said, I can't speak to it now because she was kind of the liaison
[00:34:36] to all the families. I can't speak to it now, but I just want you to know that something happened last
[00:34:42] week that was very significant and your, you know, your husband's and sons what they did is,
[00:34:51] you know, was incredible. And, you know, all of all of mother thinks is, well, you know, bad
[00:34:59] stuff is going down. And so she leading up to that knock, she was on edge. She was on edge that
[00:35:08] entire deployment, but even more so after that email came and, you know, I think that is,
[00:35:17] she tried to every morning when she woke up, she sent a mini mail, he didn't email back, but she
[00:35:21] sent a mini mail every day, she was sending another care package that probably wasn't getting to
[00:35:28] him who's getting to, you know, Faluja, but where he was, he wasn't having care packages
[00:35:33] dropped into store, but it was like those were the things she had to do to like process while
[00:35:38] he was there. Like this is what's going to get me through. And that Sunday, I think there,
[00:35:43] there's something about the fact that, you know, she woke up that morning and just said,
[00:35:47] I want to have people over. Like it was, there was no plan around it. And she was a planner.
[00:35:53] So, but that morning, she woke up and said, Tom, let's have people over. So, you imagine all these
[00:36:00] different scenarios, all these different knocks that people get. And, you know, you see mine,
[00:36:05] you're going to see Heather's and Amy's in the book as well. But, imagine a scenario where
[00:36:13] the mother and father are opening the door and there's 30 people in the house, you know,
[00:36:18] there to have a family barbecue. And I remember when I walked in that door, I could see smoke coming
[00:36:27] off the grill because my dad had walked to enter the door and left all the meat on the grill.
[00:36:33] And it's out there like on fire. And it was like, it was pure pandemonium. Like, my people,
[00:36:42] nobody knows what to do. And people are just literally running around a house like screaming
[00:36:48] all the women are just screaming. Like, there is no sanity in this room. And I think that's why
[00:36:52] my dad's just like, I'm going to stand out in this driveway, you know, with Colonel Gardner,
[00:36:57] because he's just like, and then the rest is like, all these women and people are coming up like,
[00:37:01] what do you need? I'm like, what do I like? What kind of question is that? I don't know. I don't even
[00:37:06] know what, what is upright now, you know? But that chaotic scene is something that plays out a lot
[00:37:18] in my mind over and over, you know? Well, time of day, was it? It was like one o'clock in the afternoon,
[00:37:24] you know, it was like, come up for a Sunday barbecue and, you know, ants and uncles are there.
[00:37:31] My dad's siblings, you know, some of my dad's siblings, all my mom's siblings, my grandmother.
[00:37:37] It was my cousins, you know? It was just that. And my mom was always like, kind of the person,
[00:37:43] like, coming to my home, you know, let's do something. But just to have those people there,
[00:37:49] when that moment took place, I remember turning, as I turned to walk in the door, I turned and it
[00:37:57] was my little cousins. And it's my dad's sister, my aunt Susan, she was standing there with my
[00:38:06] gods on and her two other kids and they were standing on like the step going to the back of the
[00:38:12] house and she's just trying to console these little kids who grew up with Travis. I mean,
[00:38:17] literally grew up with him and she's just trying, and I'm just like, you can't even,
[00:38:25] you can't even play that scene out in a movie, you know? I mean, you can't even capture what what it was.
[00:38:37] You, um, you, you talk about that scene and then, and then you say this in all the chaos and
[00:38:45] furious movement, I locked eyes with my grandmother who's seated alone in a wheelchair in the dining room,
[00:38:50] tears streaming down her cheeks. She was receiving neither comfort nor attention from anyone.
[00:38:55] My heart broke in that instant. I'll never forget that image. The rest of the day is a blur.
[00:39:02] I floated between feelings of painful shock and dark emptiness. When I woke the next morning,
[00:39:11] I remembered what it felt like coming out of anesthesia from an operation I'd had in college.
[00:39:17] First one, I lit open cautiously, then the next, but my body remained frozen. My mind was already
[00:39:22] turning going over the details of the previous day and coming to terms with the unalterable fact
[00:39:28] that my best friend and brother was dead. This marked the first of what turned out to be many
[00:39:35] anxiety-ridden mornings that would follow. Every day I would slowly and rarely transition from
[00:39:40] sleep to consciousness, hoping that my overwhelming anxiety wouldn't make another appearance, but it
[00:39:47] always did. Did you ever have the um, did you ever wake up in the morning and forget for like
[00:39:59] three seconds? What had happened? No, um, I didn't. It was actually more like a soon,
[00:40:10] as soon as I opened my eyes, tears, I would be crying. Like if I was awake, I was either like
[00:40:20] non-functional or I was crying. And I would say for a good month, I woke up and I'm like,
[00:40:28] oh my gosh, I think so every day for the rest of my life, I'm going to wake up crying. You're
[00:40:34] like, you go through these things. Like, okay, this is the new normal I will wake up crying every
[00:40:38] day. And I honestly could not wait every night to fall asleep because the only time I wasn't
[00:40:45] in pain was when I was sleeping. So it was just like how quickly he came my body and in those moments,
[00:40:54] it's not easy to sleep, right? So sleep didn't come very easily. So I was so thankful when my body
[00:41:00] would let me sleep. And you know, that was the only time I was necessarily forgetting.
[00:41:08] I've experienced like when something really bad happens, like when I've lost friends and
[00:41:13] I wake up in the morning and for like three, literally three seconds, you know, the alarm clock
[00:41:19] goes off and I, you know, shut off the alarm clock and I, and everything's like totally normal
[00:41:26] for like for three seconds. And then I take two steps out of my bed and boom, I get hit.
[00:41:39] Now you all go to meet Travis as he is flown home and we're going to the book, the
[00:41:49] greeting at Dover was gut wrenching. My parents and I were plagued by questions in those early days
[00:41:55] that were difficult to ignore who his Travis with when he died, what happened? Was it instant?
[00:42:00] Slowly the answers started to unfold. We learned that Travis wasn't actually scheduled to be
[00:42:05] out on the mission the day that he was killed. Instead of fellow marine was slated for the patrol,
[00:42:10] but he wasn't feeling up to a Travis who had been assigned to do some humanitarian work at a
[00:42:15] local Iraqi school offered to take his place. During the course of the patrol, Travis and his
[00:42:19] team of Marines were ambushed, a firefighter erupted and they were quickly pinned down,
[00:42:25] taking fire from three sides, Travis seeing his Navy corpsman shot and line wounded in the middle
[00:42:30] of the road immediately ran out of the line of fire to carry his colleague to safety.
[00:42:34] As the ambush intensified, Travis again entered the line of fire to pull another wounded
[00:42:39] marine back to safety in a covered position. Then Travis moved out to take on the ambush
[00:42:44] that was now overwhelming his patrol undontered by the onslaught he fired his M203 grenade launcher,
[00:42:50] taking out an enemy position and then expended a firestorm of rounds at the other positions
[00:42:55] before running out of ammunition. His efforts pushed the enemy back and changed the entire momentum
[00:43:01] of the ambush, ultimately saving the lives of his entire patrol. It was then that Travis was shot by a sniper
[00:43:11] and immediately the enemy began to pull back. His teammates quickly grabbed them and provided
[00:43:16] what emergency medical care they could. He was rushed back to Camp Felusia where he was pronounced
[00:43:23] dead by the medical staff that had worked feverishly to try and save him.
[00:43:31] There's no part of that story that doesn't sound just like my brother.
[00:43:35] Offering to take the worst assignment to help a friend and need, that was Travis.
[00:43:43] Thinking about the safety of others before ever considering his own, that was Travis too.
[00:43:48] Seeing the dismal odds that didn't bode well for him and choosing to grid his teeth and answer
[00:43:53] a fire with more fire anyway, also Travis. My brother was a protector and a warrior in every sense
[00:44:02] of those terms. I certainly felt it as a sister and I'm proud to know that his fellow marines
[00:44:09] got to experience it too. When I learned that he'd been killed by a bullet, I was never said
[00:44:16] wouldn't be able to stomach the sight of him in an open casket. My mind imagined the worst.
[00:44:24] I was shocked then when the lid of the casket was raised at the viewing to see my brother looking
[00:44:28] as though he were sleeping peacefully. Just as I'd remembered him, I approached the coffin
[00:44:37] and rubbed his head as I'd done a hundred times before. From the time he was a child,
[00:44:44] Travis had always supported a buzz cut and as I felt the surface of his freshly cut hair with
[00:44:50] my fingertips, I thought, yep, that's Travis's head.
[00:45:14] That was Travis.
[00:45:18] It's like his whole life was leading to this moment where he needed to do something beyond
[00:45:34] what is expected of a human being to do. When you look back
[00:45:41] at his childhood, I think he was doing things that were beyond what a ten-year-old child
[00:45:52] was supposed to do or what a 15-year-old kid was supposed to do. It was like,
[00:45:57] and they were small moments in the whole scheme of things, but they ultimately
[00:46:03] prepared him for that last day.
[00:46:10] I was after Mikey Montstorre, got killed and we came home and I was talking to Mikey's sister.
[00:46:19] She was just, she just said, yeah, she said when I found out what happened, I wasn't even remotely
[00:46:24] surprised at all. She's like, oh, he jumped on a grenade and saved three of his friends. She's like,
[00:46:30] that's exactly, she's like, I don't want to say that I knew that this would happen, but she said,
[00:46:38] this is no surprise at all. Yeah.
[00:46:47] Going back to the book, I stood by a side all day greeting friends and family who had taken
[00:46:51] the time to pay the respects. One of Travis's best friends and roommate at the Naval Academy
[00:46:56] Brendan Looney was unable to make the funeral. He was in San Diego attending the basic underwater
[00:47:02] demolition seal school, the training program required for Navy seals, leaving to attend the
[00:47:08] services on the East Coast would have surely meant relinquishing his chance to become a seal officer.
[00:47:13] But Brendan's girlfriend at the time Amy, who had also been close to Travis, did come to say
[00:47:19] her final goodbye. I remember Amy walking up to the casket, investing into tears. I knew the loss
[00:47:29] cut her deeply as well. It was a physically and mentally exhausting day and as much as I could
[00:47:36] hardly bear the idea of standing by that casket one minute longer after hours of doing so. I also
[00:47:41] didn't want to imagine that time coming to an end. I knew that after the last person knelt down to
[00:47:49] say a prayer in front of Travis, the funeral director was going to close that casket forever
[00:47:54] and that would be it. I'd never seen my brother's face again. I rubbed his head one last time
[00:48:05] and felt my heart sinking as my father gently pulled me away.
[00:48:23] After the funeral, the burial and the celebration of his life that followed I remember sitting
[00:48:29] on the back stairs outside my parents home to the same place where I'd saw it sawless and the
[00:48:33] chaos after first hearing of his death, the winter had melted away. In a beautiful spring day
[00:48:40] had sprung up in its place in the weeks and months that followed I often found myself outside
[00:48:44] crouched on that stair and that in those stairs in that same position. Time was passing. Life was
[00:48:53] moving on. I was watching it happen but I was not participating in it. I felt bitterness towards
[00:49:01] the people who could return to their normal lives, jobs and families while I sat on the same stair
[00:49:07] in the same red sweatshirt terrified of what might come next.
[00:49:20] I, you know when you were talking about like saying, oh this is just the way it's going to be
[00:49:27] from now on. I'm just going to be crying all the time and I had somebody asked me about you know
[00:49:34] when is this end? How do you get through this? The way I tried to explain it is by saying
[00:49:45] when you first experience something devastating like this you're going to get hit with these waves
[00:49:49] and the waves are going to be really powerful, really strong and they're going to come really
[00:49:57] often. And what's scary about them is by the time you're 28 years old or 20 years old or whatever
[00:50:06] however old you are you've learned to control your emotions and all of a sudden you're in a situation
[00:50:11] where you don't have control anymore. And it seems like like you said that's just the way it's going
[00:50:17] to be from now on. And then what I've noticed is over time those waves they start to lose some strength.
[00:50:27] They're just not as strong as they were and over time those waves they separate and they get
[00:50:33] further and further apart. And what happens is this is what I thought of when I read this
[00:50:38] this part that you wrote is you know the closer you are to the person the stronger those waves are
[00:50:46] and the longer it takes for that calm to approach. So when you see other people that are already kind
[00:50:53] of have found some calm again and they're moving on it makes you it can make you mad.
[00:51:00] Totally. I you know they have that the 12 stages of grief I couldn't name all 12 stages and
[00:51:08] and followed but like I know anger's up there and I felt anger you know and it was just like
[00:51:15] and it was anger at everyone else like screw you guys you know we're we're we're just we're here
[00:51:24] we're living it and you're living their lives on the flipside you know having some perspective like
[00:51:32] thank you for being there for us thank you for doing what you did thank you for
[00:51:37] leaving your job for a week to support my family you know you don't have that mindset when
[00:51:43] you're in it you're like oh you're going back to work you're you're flying back like what do you
[00:51:47] mean like no you're all supposed to be here and you know we're all going to live together in this house
[00:51:54] and and support each other yeah you you think yourself life is not going to go on the way was ever
[00:52:00] yeah and and that was the that was the scariest part so was this this idea of like it was that
[00:52:06] initial walk through the door and then then everything takes over you know you go into this auto pilot
[00:52:13] of like we've got to plan for everything so it's the anticipation of being it dover but that
[00:52:20] anticipation comes with a level of excitement isn't the right word but like I can't wait till
[00:52:31] that call from comes on the plate off the plane there he is he's now with us you know and
[00:52:36] it's the small steps and it's like okay next is the viewing I can't wait to be able to see my
[00:52:42] brother and then it's like we're closing that casket and it's like another thing you know you walk
[00:52:48] through that door the casket's closing the funeral mass happens everyone comes back you've got
[00:52:54] hundreds and hundreds of people at a reception and then it's like that last bag of trash is taken
[00:53:01] out by the neighbor and they say bye and you're like oh crap now we actually really have to think
[00:53:08] about what this means you know because you're just kind of going through this process by the way I failed
[00:53:21] to mention this so far I'm not reading the whole book and so if there's some things that are jumping
[00:53:26] around or whatever that's why because I'm not here to do an audio version of this book but that's
[00:53:33] why I'm reading chunks of it but you've got all kinds of detail in there that I'm not going over
[00:53:39] and connecting these chunks that I'm reading so that's why people should just buy the books I haven't
[00:53:44] said that yet but if there's anything that seems to be that's why it is jump because I'm jumping
[00:53:50] around from section to section you continue on here it was hard to believe that only weeks before
[00:53:58] I'd been so happy blissfully ignorant of how my life would be cruelly abruptly and permanently
[00:54:04] changed I remember sitting in my kitchen two weeks before Travis died I was watching my baby girl
[00:54:10] all nine and a half months old pull herself up to stand on uncertain wobbly legs she stood with
[00:54:15] her chubby hands on the screen door she stood next to our dog pup and giggled excitedly as she
[00:54:23] peered outside and watched a bunny rabbit hop around the backyard life is so completely perfect
[00:54:29] I remember thinking at that moment I was a happy new mom had a fantastic relationship with my husband
[00:54:35] business was good and Travis would be back in time for the grand opening of my second store I felt
[00:54:40] holy in control and at peace to this day that peaceful feeling sometimes comes back to me for a moment
[00:54:47] when life feels effortless my mind is at ease and all seems right in the world but now it dissolves
[00:54:54] in an instant in fact as soon as I experienced that kind of serenity I become terrified what terrible
[00:55:00] tragedy is going to shatter this picture of perfect peace I asked myself I still wonder if the
[00:55:05] sense of calm I experienced that day had been a harboredger of the doom to come I worry that I was
[00:55:12] foolish for not having recognized it for what it was all the signs of catastrophe will right in front
[00:55:17] of me how could I have been so blind this train of thought is of course completely paranoid and insane
[00:55:27] so do you feel that now to this day yeah you know I I do I don't have many times where life feels effortless
[00:55:38] anymore but you know I I remember that feeling I had that day in my house I remember that feeling so vividly
[00:55:50] just it was this wave that came over me where I was like oh my gosh like this is what a great life
[00:55:58] I have you know I'm like looking at my new daughter and I'm just and and I think I just got
[00:56:03] off the phone with Travis like a day or two prior and and our conversations had nothing to do with
[00:56:09] what he was doing when I rack he's like talking to me about you know what what kind of men's
[00:56:14] brands did you get for the story you know it is a cool stuff and and so it was just like the
[00:56:21] super peaceful feeling and I lived up into that point not really fearful of anything
[00:56:29] and you know I certainly today I'm certainly afraid of I'm afraid when I get a random call
[00:56:42] I'm afraid when my husband calls me twice in a row you know those things can set me into a
[00:56:49] different place they can they can certainly you know I my favorite show was my favorite show was
[00:56:57] big love that was an HBO series on like polygamy and it was really popular when
[00:57:05] scripted series when around that time and I love the show was a guy who was the guy who was in it
[00:57:13] he's he since passed away but anyway great show it was Bill Paxon yeah and yeah there
[00:57:20] you know it was a great show and I remember watching that show and and these are the things
[00:57:28] that you don't realize are going to happen so I'm watching the show and it's like the series finale
[00:57:32] and it was those little things where I was like this is post Travis's death and I'm like well
[00:57:38] you know big love zone that's something I can enjoy I'm going to watch this season finale
[00:57:44] and I'm watching the finale and on the finale like the head polygamous get shot and he
[00:57:51] gets shot on the street and watching him get shot it sent me into a full blown panic attack
[00:57:58] it was such a visceral reaction that I wasn't expecting that it it's stunned me and I was like oh my god
[00:58:05] I I can't see that I mean my my five-year-old walks around he's got a little like pistol that was
[00:58:12] that was that was Dave's my husband's and he brought it my mother-in-law found it and she brought it
[00:58:18] back about a month ago and it's the cutest little thing with the whole stir and I can't be around
[00:58:23] Travis holding it my little Travis holding it it unlike David there's something about like guns now
[00:58:29] you know there's seeing them pointed being shot like it sends me in a in a bad place you know and
[00:58:36] it's it's those sort of things that you don't you don't realize until a little bit after the fact
[00:58:43] that okay these are the residual effects and some of them go away and some of them don't you know
[00:58:49] um and some of them just starve a part of who you are now and I'm I'm definitely a
[00:58:59] a jumpier person you know like I hear something like what happened you know we're before I was
[00:59:04] not like that I was kind of like um you heard something you know you talk a little bit about that
[00:59:13] more here you say the fear and paranoia that follow in the wake of grief can create a tremendous
[00:59:18] roadblock it stunts our personal growth and darkens our overall sense of well-being some people respond
[00:59:23] to unexpected and trying situations with passive acquiescence and others with fire and fury I responded
[00:59:30] by heightening my vigilance after Travis's death I found myself compelled to be wary I was
[00:59:37] always on the lookout for the next great tragedy to befall me this hurled me down some very dark
[00:59:43] and troublesome paths from panic attacks to self-destructive behaviors but also led me to some
[00:59:49] amazing gifts like recovering my sense of humor and living with intention what self-destructive
[00:59:54] behaviors did you pick up I mean I think you know self-destructive in a way that you know I stopped
[01:00:04] kind of taking care of myself you know you I I go into the next place where I'm talking about
[01:00:12] you know I decide to run a marathon but I'm running a marathon smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[01:00:18] and you know I'm drinking a lot and I'm just kind of like I'm gonna do this but on the same token
[01:00:26] you know this is kind of who I am now you know and you know with the with that that
[01:00:35] hypersense of paranoia you know I really went into some these ideas of and I know what
[01:00:46] I know the reasoning behind it if I can look back and like psychoanalyze myself when Travis was in
[01:00:51] Iraq I was not worried about him and when he was there the first time when he was there the second time
[01:00:58] even though I knew the second deployment was different I was aware of that because my husband told me
[01:01:04] he's like hey this is gonna be different you know I've had conversations with your brother but I had
[01:01:09] no fear of my brother being an Iraq it was this notion of more than anything you think about
[01:01:18] like these crazy stories right you know I spur like you know I sickle falling off a garage and like
[01:01:27] impaling a woman on her head right and it's like these totally crazy stories and you're like that's
[01:01:32] so crazy well I mean it's never gonna happen to you right it's like the plane crash theory like
[01:01:37] we all fly on planes but you know you tell your kids planes are planes don't crash you know you're
[01:01:42] not gonna be in a plane the crashes so you don't think about that happening to you and that
[01:01:48] maybe it was a defense mechanism but that's how I got through Travis being an Iraq I wasn't you know
[01:01:56] I didn't show any fear I didn't show any I and I didn't even have any fear it wasn't that I didn't
[01:02:01] show it I really didn't have it I let those emotions all go so then when it did happen it was
[01:02:07] like I guess when you do this idea of like preparing right where your it's almost like I knew this
[01:02:12] was coming like you hear people like I knew it I knew it right like I had no idea and so to have
[01:02:20] something shock your system that much I think it kind of rewires you where you're kind of waiting
[01:02:29] for that next shock to the system and you know you lead on throughout the book and and I've had
[01:02:35] other things that have that have happened since where I know like there no one is void of having
[01:02:43] something happen you know whether it's random in nature I've had a lot of random crappy things
[01:02:49] happened to me you know over the last several years I guess it's similar again this is something
[01:02:55] I just talked about with Jim Sersley who was on the last podcast was in Vietnam and the range of
[01:03:02] level of fear that guys have going into combat there's some people that are scared they're like
[01:03:08] they think they're gonna die right and there's some people that are kind of like that will actually
[01:03:13] not happen to me like I'm I'm I'm not gonna die and that was kind of his attitude was your your
[01:03:18] your thinking oh that's yeah like he volunteered to go Vietnam he wasn't like I'm volunteer
[01:03:23] tearing to go Vietnam and I might die he was like I'm volunteering to go to Vietnam and I'm gonna
[01:03:28] go do my job and and so I guess it's no surprise for some people on the family side to think well
[01:03:37] yeah that's not gonna happen to my loved one yeah I I've never really asked my parents this I don't
[01:03:43] think my parents ever thought anything would ever happen to me ever you know I thought that I think
[01:03:47] they just thought I was just overdoing and just whatever part of that is because I I kind of
[01:03:56] inculcated them to just not never knowing what I was doing ever and I was in for a long time and
[01:04:00] before the war started I had already been in for 13 years so they never knew that I was jumping
[01:04:05] out of airplanes or doing whatever I was doing and so when the war started I was just still going
[01:04:08] on deployments like I'd always gone I'd been I'd gone on deployments I'd gone on five deployments
[01:04:14] before I went to Iraq so that to them there it's like oh he's going on another deployment we'll
[01:04:17] hear from him in six months whatever my wife may be the same thing but
[01:04:23] until like when when I was in a modian my wife was at home and she was going to my
[01:04:29] guys funeral and when that happens every single family member that's there is thinking that
[01:04:35] the person that was killed could easily be you know my husband my brother my son now you talk a
[01:04:56] little bit about just this idea of grief the fact is grief will transform you and you've got
[01:05:06] will italicized which I think is important because you're saying listen like you because I think
[01:05:15] that's what I think that's the discovery that you made in that statement is your thinking hey
[01:05:20] I can get through this and everything is I'll be back to the way things were and you're saying
[01:05:25] no the fact is grief will transform you whether you are grieving the loss of an identity that you
[01:05:31] once had or the loss of a loved one at some point you will look in the mirror and see someone
[01:05:35] you simply don't recognize staring back at you it is inevitable maybe you should maybe you'll
[01:05:40] be proud of what you see and maybe you'll be ashamed at some point I bet you be both I bet you will
[01:05:45] be both the most important thing you can tell yourself is that you get the last word
[01:05:52] only you can determine how your experiences will change you and only you can be held accountable
[01:06:02] for that transformation so these are these are powerful things I wrote a book and I guess I talk about
[01:06:16] an attitude of extreme ownership of taking ownership of what's going on and you know there's always
[01:06:22] someone that wants to make different points or trying I'll be positive about it there's people
[01:06:29] that want to that people that want to test the theory right should take ownership and so one of the
[01:06:34] things that can happen is you know I got cancer that's not my fault how do I take ownership of that
[01:06:41] and it's like well you're right you can't take ownership of the fact that you got cancer
[01:06:44] you take ownership of how you respond to it and I just was out with working with a group of people
[01:06:51] and one of the guys had cancer and he was like hey I started listening to the podcast and
[01:07:00] he's like I listened to your podcast for seven hours a day every day the whole time I was in the hospital
[01:07:06] which makes me feel good about having 500 hours a little bit of that guy but that's what he did he took ownership
[01:07:14] of how he responded and that's what you're saying here look you're gonna something's gonna happen there's
[01:07:20] going to be changes but you do have what do you say but you get the last word right well I think you know
[01:07:28] one of the things that I have people still to this day say you know and and and I'm 12 years out
[01:07:35] from the loss of my brother seven years out from the loss of my mom and nine years out from the
[01:07:46] loss of Brendan right and and people will say you know when does when do you stop grieving
[01:07:55] and I'll even have people that have newly lost someone like explain this grief process like when is it
[01:08:01] gonna end and I'm very clear to tell them it doesn't it never ends I'm not going to say don't worry
[01:08:11] you know in the year it's over because everybody's journey is their own but the fact of the matter
[01:08:19] is that I entered into my if you want to call it grief journey in in a way that
[01:08:27] wasn't best for me right I wasn't it was a it was a process and now when you look at like
[01:08:35] talking about looking in the mirror and are you the person you want to be like when I look in the mirror
[01:08:40] today I'm the person that I wish Travis saw when he was alive like that's and so that for me is
[01:08:50] like that was my wake up I'm like okay so this is what the grief of my brother has done to me
[01:08:57] it's actually allowed me to become the person I should have been when he was here I was
[01:09:03] had a guy in the podcast his name was Tom Fife he was he was he was in World War II
[01:09:11] Korea and Vietnam and he was a purple heart recipient from all those wars and he was a battalion
[01:09:20] commander in Vietnam and I was talking to him about it and like I asked him you know basically you
[01:09:31] know I think I asked him how many casualties did you take or how many guys did you lose
[01:09:35] as a battalion commander and so this is for I don't know 50 or 60 years later and he got choked up
[01:09:43] and when that happened I thought to myself oh the emotions that I have they're never going to
[01:09:51] go away yeah and that's just the way it is and there's nothing wrong with that you know the waves get
[01:09:57] the waves get more separation between them over time but those waves can hit you
[01:10:05] yeah and I think you know what I find now is the further you get out the waves actually
[01:10:16] come it like really in opportune times so I'm not an incredibly emotional person to begin with
[01:10:26] that bout of the first month after Travis's death was probably the most crying I've ever done
[01:10:32] in my entire life but it was like it was in involuntary response like I could there was not that's
[01:10:38] just what it was and I if I was out in public I had on the biggest sunglasses you could
[01:10:45] possibly find because I did not I get uncomfortable when people see me emotional and so I
[01:10:51] I had tried to cover it and but now today you know the way those waves come it's it could be
[01:11:00] something so small that someone says or something I see and it doesn't matter where I am and it's
[01:11:06] just like oh my god and it kind of like takes your breath away takes you back to that place and you
[01:11:11] know I do a lot of public speaking and and I share Travis's story and and everyone's like I don't
[01:11:16] know how you do that without breaking down and I'm like listen that's not the time for me to break
[01:11:21] down like I'm there to do a job I'm there to share that story and make sure that you hear that
[01:11:25] story but if you think for one second that there aren't times I'm driving in the car and a song
[01:11:31] comes on or I'm out on a run or I'm sitting there looking at my kids and you know yeah that's
[01:11:36] still happens and and it and it doesn't come as as often but like you said you know 50 60 years out
[01:11:46] a service member talking about his friends like that's never going to go away and nor what I
[01:11:51] wanted to exactly exactly you continue on here like anyone who is received a jarring knock at the door
[01:11:59] literal or figurative and that's what's important and you again since I'm jumping around this book
[01:12:04] you know there's the metaphorical knock at the door that a service member's family can receive
[01:12:10] but the knock in the door can be anything sure anything that is unexpected in your life
[01:12:16] and everyone's going to get him in your life you're going to get a knock at the door that you
[01:12:20] want to do what your mom did which slammed the door and don't let it come in but it's coming yeah
[01:12:27] I've been to the darkest deepest and ugliest corners of my mind and I've learned a thing or two
[01:12:32] I don't hope to spare you the hurt or pain that comes with a knock I'll read that again I don't
[01:12:39] hope to spare you the hurt or pain that comes with the knock I don't think that I could I only hope
[01:12:46] to share the lessons I learned in the process the ones that have the power to transform you in all the
[01:12:50] right ways and remind you that you are not alone so yeah you you're not saying that you can
[01:13:01] make the pain go away it's going to hurt but there's there's steps you can take to move through that
[01:13:09] hurt that make more sense like you said looking back yeah this book is all built on perspective
[01:13:16] I'll tell you that you know I mean I I couldn't rip this book even five years ago you know
[01:13:23] I mean it it took 12 years to be able to say okay I'm ready to put pen to paper and listen I'm
[01:13:32] no expert but I've got a lot of experience and grief you know so I'm going to kind of share
[01:13:41] share my thoughts on that well it helps any time you can have any time you can
[01:13:48] see something unfold for someone else it makes you able to better handle it yourself just 100%
[01:13:54] that's why read war books all the time so I was able to try and figure out what was happening in
[01:13:58] combat even if I'd never seen it before I'd seen it before you say this in the early days after
[01:14:06] Travis was killed my decision making was more impulsive than rational impulsive decisions can be
[01:14:10] catastrophic and a few of mine have been but they've also been a great way for me to channel my
[01:14:15] nervous energy I think subconsciously I believed that as long as I was doing something anything
[01:14:20] then I would have to then I wouldn't have to acknowledge the intense pain that was overtaking my
[01:14:24] spirit and fighting to get out two weeks before Travis was killed he called home from my rack I wanted
[01:14:32] I want to run the Marine Corps marathon he told my dad that's great travel my dad responded and I
[01:14:37] want you to run it with me he finished my father was then in his early 50s and in solid shape
[01:14:41] but this was no small request after running the Marine Corps marathon a couple times when he was
[01:14:46] younger my dad had retired his marathon shoes forever he thought but he wasn't about to say no to his
[01:14:51] son fighting a war thousands of miles away let's do it he replied he mid-May when the funeral
[01:14:57] services were over and my parents extended family and friends were gathered in the living room
[01:15:02] my dad remembered his promise to Travis I'm still gonna run that marathon he proclaimed to the
[01:15:07] quiet gathering of distraught dumbstruck family members all run to Tom said Chris my dad's youngest brother
[01:15:15] I'm in echoed his wife my aunt Susan one by one people picked up their heads hardened to their
[01:15:20] gazes and joined him pretty soon every single person in that rumored committed to 26.2 miles
[01:15:26] in honor of Travis I was conveniently engrossed in the thread on the carpet when I felt a dozen
[01:15:32] pairs of eyes landing intently on my face I looked up now I'd been an athlete in college but that
[01:15:38] was almost five years earlier I'd given birth to mag the only ten months before and I had run
[01:15:42] so much as a five K and ages but those stairs were burning a hole right through my skin
[01:15:47] and thankfully my bullheadedness kicked in all right I'll do it I said I mean how hard could it be
[01:15:56] and then you you get done with your first training run and at the end of that first one mile run
[01:16:00] weezing forcefully and doubled over in pain I gave myself a little pad on the back good job Ryan
[01:16:05] you did today's run you're done now go home drink some water and chill but make damn sure you
[01:16:10] show up for tomorrow's run and that's how it went every day for four and a half months no
[01:16:14] matter how slow ugly or painful the run might have been I completed it there was no 26.2 mile run
[01:16:20] ahead of me there was no 26.2 mile ahead of me there was only today as the proverb says there's
[01:16:27] only one way to eat an elephant one bite at a time so you you talk about your training I thought
[01:16:33] it was cool you you've got Travis's iPod yeah how awesome was that it was awesome yeah came back
[01:16:38] in his foot locker and I'm like all right and he was so into music and we both shared like a
[01:16:46] deep love of music we went to concerts together all the time and so that was like exciting I didn't
[01:16:52] have an iPod at the time so it came back and it was what and I'm like gosh I hope I can get this
[01:16:57] thing working and you know plug it in and I was like all right there we go it's so crazy to think that
[01:17:02] these digital memories of people I mean and even I mean today today the digital memories of people
[01:17:09] are going to be crazy I mean it's just you're going to have all these images and videos and writing
[01:17:14] and posts and all this stuff for people yeah and like even just something like that what is it
[01:17:21] 12 years ago you know this iPod you know you fast you go rewind another 20 years behind that there's
[01:17:28] no iPod there's no there's you might have a mix tape I guess well I look it too it's interesting like
[01:17:33] and I remember talking to Travis on his first deployment I'm like let me set you up a my space profile
[01:17:38] it's kind of not doing that I'm like come on and you know so he had no imprint on social media
[01:17:45] at all but just a few years later you know when Brendan was killed I was Facebook friends with
[01:17:51] Brendan Brendan had a Facebook page you know and it was just that that small that small time
[01:17:56] but to have that iPod the coolest thing about it for me is that it wasn't just like it was
[01:18:02] Travis's iPod I'm like this is what he was taking in when he was in Iraq yeah for sure you know so
[01:18:08] like I'm listening to it and I just felt it it felt like such a deep connection with where he had been
[01:18:15] and you know it's so cool about that what you just said you even realize how right you are because
[01:18:20] like I had my iPod in Iraq my last deployment which was 2006 and those songs like what
[01:18:28] however many songs were on my iPad at the time like whatever 215 songs or whatever it was
[01:18:35] whenever I hear those songs right now I'm right back I mean I was 100% listening to the same
[01:18:40] songs over and over and over again yeah and I'm and I'm now brought back I hear any of those songs
[01:18:45] I'm brought back to training for that marathon that's where they bring me back to so you talk
[01:18:50] about the training and then here we go as the big data approached this is for the marathon my
[01:18:54] family and I headed to Washington through which the marathon course runs the night before the race
[01:18:59] we held a dinner for our team which by now had grown to nearly a hundred people
[01:19:04] on's uncles cousins friends neighbors lacrosse and wrestling butter buddies fellow marines and
[01:19:08] naval academy grads all of them were participating to honor my brother at dinner at a hotel we
[01:19:14] invited a few people including Brendan Looney who is to say a few words Brendan stood
[01:19:18] solemnly at the microphone he stared he started in about how Travis had been a brother to him
[01:19:24] and how he couldn't believe he was gone he was a great friend Brendan said I'll never forget him
[01:19:29] and I miss him he'd been choking back tears and finally his voice broke I have to get out of this
[01:19:35] room I thought I simply couldn't watch this tough navy seal breakdown as he remembered my brother
[01:19:40] it was too much I slipped out of the hotel and found myself gulping in the cold fall air outside my
[01:19:46] head was spinning and I couldn't help but feel that I was learning for the first time that Travis
[01:19:51] was gone forever I lit a cigarette it had been on and off habit of mine over the years one that
[01:19:57] Travis had always chastised me about maybe one day I'll write a book about what not to do in running
[01:20:02] a marathon chain smoking the night before the race would certainly make the list but it's not even
[01:20:08] the worst transgression I've committed fortunately for you this isn't a book about endurance training
[01:20:12] it's a book about grief which perhaps isn't so different the key to navigating grief I found
[01:20:17] is to have the courage to allow it to transform you same same theme like accepting the fact that
[01:20:26] it's going to make you different I've had to remind myself time and time again we're only human
[01:20:32] we can only take so much don't be so hard on yourself when you take one step forward and
[01:20:37] several steps back you made it this far you got up today and put one foot in front of the other
[01:20:42] you completed today's run go home relax and get ready for tomorrow's now you get into the
[01:20:48] marathon which is a great story I'm jumping ahead a little bit here but got to my own 19 and I still
[01:20:54] had 7.2 miles to complete at this point the wheels had all but come off my brain was no longer
[01:21:01] able to bully my body into behaving my knees my ankles my arch is everything was rebelling
[01:21:07] I slowed to a walk and began to debate with myself began to debate with myself that any distant
[01:21:13] run distance runner knows well 18 miles is great you should be proud of yourself there's no shame
[01:21:19] and stopping here you just lost your brother for God's sake didn't you really expect you to get this
[01:21:23] far call it now and leave with your dignity and your joints intact so you're having that
[01:21:30] the Quitter's conversation totally the Quitter's conversation you're having it but you're not a Quitter
[01:21:36] so I made one last ditch effort in an at I reached into my fanny pack and rifled through my unused
[01:21:41] power gels and energy beans until my fingers rested on the mass card with Travis's face on
[01:21:46] at November 19th 1980 to April 29th 2007 26 years old I gripped it tightly and offered a silent prayer
[01:21:56] this is it Travis the Marine Corps marathon course ends at the US Marine Corps warmer
[01:22:04] memorial a statue based on the iconic picture of six Marines struggling to raise a flagpole
[01:22:09] on the island of Uo G.ma during World War II it's an incredibly powerful site and when you come
[01:22:14] upon it you feel every bit is tired and as strong as those men huddled together appear to be
[01:22:20] as they raise the American flag I didn't care if my leg fell off in that very moment I was not
[01:22:27] walking up that hill I hustled into a full sprint bounded over crushed plastic cups
[01:22:33] and past exhausted runners somehow I felt my legs were fresh and reality I was probably every
[01:22:38] bit the Frankenstein I had appeared to be at my own 19 just an hour older what I actually looked like
[01:22:44] I can't say for sure and I'd rather not imagine but I pushed forward and grabbed Aunt Susan's hand
[01:22:49] as together we crossed the finish line then I collapsed I can honestly say that I'm a different
[01:22:57] person because of that race pushing myself through that training and navigating the emotional
[01:23:01] strain and physical stress taught me a lot about myself and even more about grief it took me
[01:23:07] years to process my brother's death and years more to organize my thoughts around what was
[01:23:12] to my could possibly gain from it it's only after more than a decade of reflection that I can
[01:23:17] share what I now know and here you kind of lay some of these out first what you don't know
[01:23:27] can't hear you can't hurt you which is an interesting concept what what you don't know can't
[01:23:34] hurt you wait hear me out I know this advice is usually given sarcastically and that can be
[01:23:39] for good reason but consider for a moment the wisdom in that phrase sometimes being naive is a blessing
[01:23:46] if I had known the physical mental and emotional told that the race would have taken on me I
[01:23:50] wouldn't run it I would have become paralyzed with fear and self doubt and my eyes would have
[01:23:55] remained forever fixed on that thread in the carpet but fear and self doubt often keep us from
[01:24:01] knowing our own strength and that's something we simply can't risk if I had never run that race
[01:24:07] race I would never have discovered what I was capable of achieving preparation and training
[01:24:12] our great tools they provide us with confidence to dream as big as we want to but without a healthy
[01:24:17] dose of fearless ignorance we might never bother dreaming at all it's interesting advice
[01:24:23] yeah I like it it's advice I still follow to this day I mean it's it's kind of I am I will say you know
[01:24:35] pre-travus didn't really live with fear right but I didn't really do anything to be fearful of
[01:24:44] and today I definitely have those like I say you know I'm on edge I'm always on edge but I'm also on
[01:24:51] edge in a way than I'm like what's next like I'm like hungry for what's next and I the things
[01:25:00] that I've done over the last 12 years I don't even know if I could pick five of them that I would have
[01:25:08] done pre 2007 or frankly had any interest in I mean had Travis come home nobody you see Travis
[01:25:17] placed a call from my rack to my dad to say run the marathon he wasn't called me to say run the
[01:25:22] marathon you that wasn't even a thought in his head because he knew that there was no way I would
[01:25:27] even consider running a marathon and I've just kind of approached things as like I'm just going to
[01:25:36] do it you know what's the worst that can happen and and you do you have this like what's the my
[01:25:42] brother is dead what's the worst that can happen you know I don't make it I don't make I don't
[01:25:48] finish the race and you know and that was 12 years ago and that was my I remember saying I'm
[01:25:55] going to do the finishes marathon and then I'm going to be able to say I ran a marathon and people
[01:26:01] like oh you're going to get the bug once you run one you're and I was like I never got the bug
[01:26:07] I'm like nope I have my check mark I can say when people say oh I'm like yeah I ran it
[01:26:12] you know and but I don't know what changed but you know here I am again like 12 years later and I'm
[01:26:22] rocking the Marine Corps marathon in a week and 140 pounds oh god no 20 pounds yeah yeah yeah
[01:26:32] yeah and and this is a person who's never rocked before so I go well I we have a fantastic partnership
[01:26:41] with Go Rock the Go Rock community and so I get to meet the founder of Go Rock do you have
[01:26:46] you're a met Jason McCarthy I'm not he's a great guy West Point grad and he just has this fabulous
[01:26:53] community I didn't understand it but I knew that the people connected with the Travis Manning
[01:26:59] Foundation loved rocking so I'm like all for it so they asked me to do this promotional video with Jason
[01:27:06] and to highlight our partnership and we're in Georgia and we're they're filming us and we're
[01:27:11] walking around the lake and he's like let's get Ryan a rock sack and so I put this rock sack
[01:27:15] oh yeah this set up pre-plan big time I mean the rock sack had like newspaper in it so I'm just like
[01:27:21] okay so I'm like oh this is funny because he and he's explaining the theory of rocking is like
[01:27:26] the nice thing about it is like your pace is always at a conversational pace and you know and I'm like
[01:27:32] I like that like I like that I can sit here and talk to you and we're exercising and he's
[01:27:36] talking about the benefits of it from a child perspective like you bring your kids out
[01:27:41] because they're gonna we walk in slow but you just put more weight on and you're getting a workout
[01:27:45] so conceptually I'm like okay I like it well later that night we were at a summit we had like
[01:27:52] a hundred veterans through the Travis Manning Foundation we had brought for like leadership training
[01:27:58] and later that night everybody's by the bonfire and we're few drinks in and everybody's talking
[01:28:04] about oh I'm rocking the marathon and it was like another one of their scenes instead of in
[01:28:09] my parents living room on behalf you know around a bonfire with a bunch of veterans and they're like
[01:28:15] I'm gonna I'm gonna rock the marathon I'm gonna and it was like came to me and I'm like
[01:28:19] I'm rocking the marathon and I woke up the next day and I was like yeah I don't know if I'm
[01:28:24] rocking the marathon but then I get back to Philadelphia and a rock sack shows up at my
[01:28:30] front door and I was like oh crap I guess I'm rocking the marathon itself yeah it's I was uh
[01:28:39] I was talking to Travis Mills yeah I love Travis is awesome but we were talking about
[01:28:45] you know I was talking to him like why do you and he was a total stud in high school
[01:28:50] Paul like that records like he's and he's just like a beast of a human athlete and you know I said to him
[01:28:57] why don't you go to like special forces or why don't you go to range school he's like I didn't
[01:29:00] know if I could make it and I was like oh that's funny because I as a young 18 year old kid when I
[01:29:06] joined the Navy I had enough of this right here I had enough of what do you say uh
[01:29:11] ignorance you know I was I was like an average athlete yeah and I was like oh seal training
[01:29:19] I'll make it through whatever you know and here's a total stud that was he was like I didn't
[01:29:24] know if I could make it I was like I'm you didn't have it he didn't have enough fearless ignorance
[01:29:28] but um yeah so it's the same thing and I find that a lot with these young kids that
[01:29:34] there's some kids that want to be seals but I meet I have people come to my gym here and they look
[01:29:39] like I really wanted to go seals but I know if I could make it I'm always thinking man you're
[01:29:43] in better shape than I ever want it's right but you gotta have a little bit of fearless ignorance
[01:29:47] yeah that's a little bit yeah I mean hey I'm I'm using my fearless ignorance again to
[01:29:54] rock this marathon I'm just you know but but that also comes coupled with um knowing how
[01:30:03] hard a marathon is so Chrisda who's in a lot of this book you know she's I've convinced her to
[01:30:09] rock the marathon with me she's never done a marathon before and we did 80 miles last week and she's
[01:30:15] like I feel great like this feels great I feel like I could keep going and I'm like you
[01:30:20] don't understand this that last 7.2 miles that that puts you over the edge I'm like she has
[01:30:25] the fear of the sacred she has no idea got it right where you want yeah I'm like I know so I
[01:30:30] I'd rather be in your shoes right now here's your next piece of advice from this section second
[01:30:36] embrace your support system relationships or everything friends family and loved ones can get us
[01:30:40] through our darkest and saddest moments we just need to let them our friends and families feed our
[01:30:45] wild ambitions they gently and lovingly protect us from our own self-destructive habits they
[01:30:51] list lift us up when we can't go another step with a loving support system we can afford to be a
[01:30:56] little naive be bald be fearless but don't do it alone you are human and you are one person
[01:31:01] allow yourself to be carried forward by those who love you and then your last piece of advice in
[01:31:07] this section and finally don't wait I beg you please don't wait I had no idea how tough I was
[01:31:17] why did I wait until my brother was dead to find out my only regret of that marathon in 2007
[01:31:23] was that it didn't take place in 2006 you know who would have loved to run and train with me
[01:31:28] Travis something like that which required focus and discipline was far more up his alley than mine
[01:31:33] he would have been so proud and we would have had a ball together there are so many things I
[01:31:38] wish I could have done together wish we could have done together I'm not the same woman he knew
[01:31:44] when he was alive I'm better I'm stronger why did I wait for him to disappear before I became
[01:31:50] the woman I wanted to be don't wait don't wait
[01:31:56] continuing on in 2007 if you were to graph my emotions for that year you would produce an
[01:32:08] interesting line a fairly stable higher horizontal line of contentment for the beginning of the year
[01:32:13] a drastic drop in April when Travis died then a gradual climb back up toward happiness until
[01:32:19] the marathon six months later I was so grateful to have something to focus on that helped me put
[01:32:23] the pieces of my life back together after the loss of my brother who was precisely the medicine I needed
[01:32:29] but by winter my line was dropping again the decline in my happiness and well being was persistent
[01:32:35] steady and interestingly almost undetectable I of course knew that my life had been far better
[01:32:42] when Travis was in it but I was managing wasn't I after all I was getting up going to work
[01:32:47] being a mom I was running errands and knocking out personal goals I was socializing and even laughing
[01:32:52] and finding joy here and there by any external the barometer I was improving I was wounded no doubt
[01:32:59] but I was happy but grief is very much an internal battle it's not kind enough to play by the rules
[01:33:06] and it certainly doesn't register on any emotional barometer it can be deceptive and believe
[01:33:12] you're not so can you in fact I would wager that no one can deceive you as effectively as you
[01:33:21] can deceive yourself grief pain sadness these feel like disadvantages they threaten our survival so
[01:33:28] naturally we shed them we convince ourselves we convince ourselves that they've gone away this is
[01:33:34] precisely what I did and it's amazing what I managed to hide from myself and for how long my emotional
[01:33:40] slope continued to creep stealthily downward for several years it continued right under my nose
[01:33:45] until Christmas 9 of 2012 when I reached rock bottom but the seeds of my deterioration had been planted
[01:33:52] several years before now we've talked about your brother and obviously had your dad on the podcast
[01:34:02] we're gonna talk about your mom a little bit and this is how you describe your mom Janet Janet
[01:34:06] Manion was a tough optimistic and focused she made every decision with self assurance as if
[01:34:12] despite any concerns or doubts that she may have been harboring the anxieties the worries they were
[01:34:18] there of course they had to be she simply would not allow them to triumph over her she had
[01:34:26] herculine will power for years after Travis's death my mother continued to be the picture of
[01:34:32] stalwart strength she ached in a way that only a mother who is buried her son can but she never
[01:34:39] let it keep her down it was especially disorienting for me then when I learned a few years later
[01:34:47] that my mother this penant of courage for our family had only eight months to live
[01:34:55] we got the news in 2011 four years after Travis's death a surgery revealed that stage four
[01:35:03] lung cancer had spread throughout her body eight months after eight months later a few days
[01:35:11] before the fifth anniversary of Travis's death my mother joined him in heaven and only five years
[01:35:18] my only sibling and my mother had died my family of four had been reduced to two I was devastated
[01:35:26] no marathon was going to make this loss and he easier to bear I had no idea where to turn for help
[01:35:31] I simply couldn't stomach the thought of picking up the pieces once again I hadn't even collected them all the
[01:35:37] first time in the months after my mother's death on April 24th 2012 I turned to the methods
[01:35:45] of coping that had become familiar to me I threw myself into my work and into my family's busy
[01:35:50] schedule I set small goals losing weight reading running anything to keep waking up every day
[01:35:57] and moving it had worked before had meant it could work again I figured I was wrong
[01:36:16] you know I think when I look at the the five-year span between
[01:36:21] Travis and my mom I kind of I'll say I peaked in terms of like with that marathon it was
[01:36:35] like I'm going to do this you know and and then from there it just became this idea like I
[01:36:41] talk now like when people ask me to screw fend like no it doesn't but at that time I didn't know
[01:36:49] that and so I thought grief grief was over for me did you have any was there any indication of what
[01:36:59] was going to what was going to happen with your mom no I mean if you looked at my family dynamic after
[01:37:10] Travis was killed she was the sparta woman that had taken over and was leading the charge
[01:37:17] and it was kind of my dad and I following behind her I mean I can't put into words the the strength
[01:37:28] that she displayed and and now with three kids in my own I can't even I can't even fathom it
[01:37:36] and so you know I was doing things between those five years she had started the Travis
[01:37:41] Manning Foundation and at first my dad and I looked at it as almost a labor of love it was like okay
[01:37:49] well this is good it's like the small memorial fond and it'll keep her distracted yeah I mean
[01:37:55] seriously we had those conversations like great way for her to channel her grief to work
[01:38:00] through things she can help people locally I mean that's how we saw it that is that is so funny
[01:38:06] because you're sitting there going oh that's fine and she's like got a master plan going on yeah oh it
[01:38:11] was like it couldn't looking back it couldn't have been more short sighted on our parts to think
[01:38:17] that she was just going to la di da around town you know and be like I've got a memorial fun like
[01:38:22] no I mean she right away was like we're going to be one of the I mean she would say things like
[01:38:30] our 9-11 heroes run this was like a 5k run that we had the year after Travis
[01:38:35] uh was killed 9-11 heroes run it was 300 people in Doyle's town Pennsylvania you know a small
[01:38:42] suburban town outside of Philadelphia and I was like this is so cool like great run great to have
[01:38:49] the community out and my mom comes up and she's like I want this to be the Susan G. Coleman
[01:38:55] race for the cure for our military community we need one of these in every city and state across
[01:39:01] the country and I'm like and you know my dad and I would be like okay Janet like like I roll like
[01:39:07] why don't we just try to get like a thousand people at the run next year you know that would be like a
[01:39:11] cool goal but you know you look at where we are today we've got we just finished our
[01:39:19] racers 90 runs across the world brought out 60 thousand people yeah Janet was in play are the
[01:39:27] Susan G. Coleman race for the cure for the military community you know bringing awareness to
[01:39:33] our military and first responders and so you know I'm watching her do that and I joined the
[01:39:42] foundation in early 2010 and I'm just kind of I mean my title was executive director my real
[01:39:53] title was Janet Manions assistant you know I mean I was her assistant and I was happy to
[01:40:00] to be that and to play that role because frankly I had no idea what I was doing and I'm following
[01:40:06] behind her and just kind of it was like you know she was teaching me you know it was I was
[01:40:17] watching everything that she did I was trying to emulate how she was doing it she was so bold
[01:40:23] and fearless like she would she had no problem asking anyone for anything and I was just like
[01:40:31] God if I can just hang around her enough to gain some of that experience and so our time was so limited
[01:40:39] that I was able to do that with her until the time she was diagnosed with cancer and it was
[01:40:46] another one of those just like gut punches but it came in like a different form as opposed to like
[01:40:52] knock going right it comes as my arm hurts your kid was you know being a pain in the butt and when
[01:41:00] I tried to pick her up she wiggled out of my arm and we're down at the beach and oh mom throw some
[01:41:06] throw some ice on it you know and we get back home and she's like my arm still hurts it's not
[01:41:13] incredibly swollen or anything like how I you don't think anything of it and so it's like a couple
[01:41:19] days later I think I'm gonna go to get my arm checked out all right I'll go with you go down to
[01:41:25] our she calls our friend who's in an orthopedic hey can you run an x-ray on me I think I might have
[01:41:30] broke my arm yeah come on in you know we left the foundation office we go in they give her an
[01:41:36] x-ray and he comes out and I just you just you knew and he comes out and he goes um so you have a
[01:41:42] little break there but I want to send you down to my friend pen to take a look at it
[01:41:48] um because there's you know just to just to get another look and you know you get another opinion
[01:41:55] well all right you just told me I broke my arm you're not gonna cast it and I'm like this is weird
[01:41:59] so I'll make you an appointment let's get you down there tomorrow and we show up at the office and it was
[01:42:06] my mom my dad and I never remember we walk up and it's like doctor someone so orthopedic oncologists
[01:42:15] and we were like you know unlike and I'm like my mom has bone cancer you know that's all I'm thinking
[01:42:22] like what and so she goes into surgery the next day and you know you don't know what a diagnosis
[01:42:31] looks like it's like she's got a tumor in her arm okay that's the most random thing I've ever heard
[01:42:35] in my life um and they're like well she had a tumor in her arm we removed it but the tumor didn't
[01:42:45] didn't start there so now we have to figure out like where it came from but that also means that
[01:42:51] wherever it came from it has spread and so it's like another and that night my parents are
[01:42:58] slated my mom's in a bed at University of Pennsylvania Hospital and my parents are supposed to be
[01:43:03] getting the um Commodore Berry citizen of the year award presented to them by general dumpfort
[01:43:09] and so my dad and I um head to the event we come back um and we get back to the room and
[01:43:19] the doctors like yeah it's uh started in her lung it's in her brain it's in her back I mean it
[01:43:26] it was everywhere and not one symptom at all like not one symptom she was not smoking cigarettes
[01:43:34] while training for a marathon you know I mean it was it was crazy it was like how does how does this happen
[01:43:40] you know and I've read a lot of studies on like grief manifestation with stress and how like your
[01:43:48] body sometimes can um let go of certain cells when you're experiencing trauma and I think there's I
[01:43:57] mean I have to believe there's something to say to that um you know Brendan Loonie's mom died
[01:44:05] three years after he was killed from cancer so I mean the the coincidences are are a lot um but
[01:44:15] you know the doctors tell us like you've got eight months to live with treatment if you decide
[01:44:20] to go to the treatment route it's just gonna help prolong you we're gonna give you about eight months
[01:44:25] my mom never really took that and was like she didn't do one of these I've got eight months to
[01:44:32] live this is what I'm gonna do she was just like okay I'm gonna start my treatments and I'm gonna
[01:44:37] keep working so you know you're she's diagnosed with stage four cancer and she's back in the
[01:44:43] office the next day and she's staying in there with you know a wrap around her arm where she had just
[01:44:49] had surgery but like it was it was a little off putting because nothing changed it wasn't like okay
[01:44:56] everything changes now what she was like now we've got a we've got a job to do and it wasn't until
[01:45:02] the very end when her health started to take um a bit of a decline that I took on more of a care
[01:45:10] take a role with her but this was like it was like eight months and six and a half of those months were just
[01:45:19] you would have never known anything was different so you know she's going to chemotherapy minutes
[01:45:25] maybe she's sick for a day she's back in the office the next day um very you know she's serving she
[01:45:29] had an appointment um an official appointment at Arlington she served on the Arlington committee
[01:45:35] um and you know she's she's taken calls and doing meetings from her bedside you know and so she
[01:45:44] she kind of kept focus on she didn't focus on what her her illness she focused on everything else
[01:45:51] um and it just got to the point at the end where her body went to allow her to to keep going like that
[01:45:58] but it was it was you know two weeks where she was really where you're like oh you're your sick
[01:46:05] but the rest of the time you would have really never known you know people look at pictures of my
[01:46:10] mom and I'm like yeah that's just a couple weeks before they did she died and they're like what
[01:46:14] could you have you know the image in your head of someone with dying of stage four cancer like
[01:46:20] she just she didn't look like that and what were you thinking this whole time
[01:46:24] I was very pragmatic I was like my mom's dying in eight months I did not um my dad on the other
[01:46:34] side was like I'm not listening to that like there's there's miracles happen every day we just got
[01:46:42] to you know stay the course things will see if there's trials you know they're trying all sorts of
[01:46:47] different holistic diets and and I was very much um supportive of that let's try everything and
[01:46:55] anything but I almost felt so jaded at that point in in life a little bit that I was like yeah I mean
[01:47:04] we got we got eight months let's see what these eight months look like
[01:47:08] you say here grief is a savage and true beast that isn't easily tamed
[01:47:19] as soon as I found a method of fending off my grief that worked for me it caught on and found a new mode of attack
[01:47:26] saying goal oriented and tough minded got me only so far then the year my mother died on Christmas
[01:47:32] night at 2012 it came to find me in my home and so your mom dies and you again this is all
[01:47:41] stuff that you talk about in the book these big parties that you guys have these big Christmas
[01:47:45] parties and they kind of go they've gone from generation to generation and your grandparents had
[01:47:48] them and your parents had them and so now it's your turn and so you have this big party and
[01:47:55] you know the the the pandemonium or whatever of a party and the planning and all that stuff
[01:48:01] and then the parties over and after the after the party you lay down you know you're really
[01:48:08] tired from doing all the work of getting it ready and you're tired but here we go back to the book
[01:48:14] but sleep didn't come something much nastier arrived in its place I felt like I received a direct
[01:48:19] punch to the gut and my eyes immediately sprang open I started hyperventilating I couldn't breathe
[01:48:24] pressure was quickly building inside my chest and my mind was on fire with anxiety it was the
[01:48:29] most terrifying panic attack I have ever experienced Dave you have to get me to the hospital I managed
[01:48:33] to get out I think I'm dying I will forever be grateful for what my husband said next
[01:48:39] no you're not stop Ryan just relax and go to bed but then you say you might think I'm getting
[01:48:47] but I'm serious and I did think you were kidding and you are serious my husband always knows what to say
[01:48:51] to me when my emotions reach a fever pitch if I had sensed even the slightest bit of concern
[01:48:57] in his voice I know the situation would have only escalated at the time however as you may imagine
[01:49:02] I did not appreciate it I immediately set off into a flurry of accusations that thankfully I
[01:49:06] can no longer remember Dave the peaceful warrior that he is remained unfazed instead he continued
[01:49:11] to speak rationally and firmly there's probably only a few minutes but they felt like my last
[01:49:16] with the intense feelings of anxiety when the intense feelings of anxiety disappeared
[01:49:21] and my breathing slowed into a natural rhythm I had an internal come to Jesus with myself
[01:49:27] clearly I was not okay I dealt with some minor anxiety before initially when Travis was deployed
[01:49:34] and then immediately after his death but nothing like this this was positively debilitating
[01:49:39] for several for the next several months I was a ghost of my former self the identity I
[01:49:43] painstakingly built for myself after Travis died a chatter on December 24th, 2012 I identified
[01:49:49] as a tough capable resilient woman I was a marathon runner I was a dedicated mom and supportive
[01:49:54] wife I had taken over as executive director of the Travis Manion Foundation the organizer
[01:49:58] the organization my mother formed to honor my brother I let a talented team and people look to
[01:50:03] me for guidance and leadership and I gave it to them but December 25th was a different ball game
[01:50:09] I was gasping for air and cursing my cursing out my exceedingly calm husband I was smoking again
[01:50:15] I crying in the shower and regularly feeling seized by anxiety that I simply couldn't shake off
[01:50:21] if this is what life is like going to be if this is what life is going to be like from now on
[01:50:25] I thought to myself one day I'm done I can't live like this
[01:50:33] then then you talk about communicating with some of your friends commiserating with Amy
[01:50:37] this is Brendan's wife was deeply helpful in putting me back on the path to recovery two years
[01:50:44] earlier she had lost her husband Brendan if there's anyone with whom I felt I could be completely
[01:50:49] vulnerable it was her one day I called her overwhelmed and furious my therapist diagnosed me with
[01:50:57] post-traumatic stress disorder today I shouted into the receiver can you believe that shit I don't
[01:51:03] have PTSD and then you go on and she says it's okay Ryan she told me my therapist told me the same
[01:51:11] thing at that point we both chuckled in a dawned on me that there was likely some truth
[01:51:15] that I'd notice naming my problem didn't do much for me but sharing it with someone else did
[01:51:21] during the following six months I started to regain my confidence humor and peace I slowly
[01:51:26] reclaimed myself life slowed down I focused on my mental health that did not mean I threw
[01:51:31] physical challenges out the window quite the opposite I began to understand what my dad meant
[01:51:35] when he told me to go for a run when I wasn't feeling myself exercise has a tremendous positive
[01:51:41] effect on the mind I was using simple exercise as a tool to help with my mental state
[01:51:52] and you again you go into some pretty good detail about this idea of not just exercise but
[01:51:59] setting these kind of little goals and doing things that sort of give you an immediate short-term
[01:52:04] gratification and you get sort of on this treadmill of you're looking for these short-term
[01:52:10] gratification things to really propel you for the next ten minutes whatever next hour and
[01:52:18] you know whether it's a run or whether it's a goal or whether it's some party or you're just
[01:52:25] you're looking for you're looking for like happiness yeah gratification temporary joy
[01:52:31] but you realize that that's not giving you the profound happiness that you're looking for.
[01:52:40] Yeah so you say this to break away from that unforgiving pattern of searching for un-matched joy
[01:52:47] you need to do one very important thing you have to be honest with yourself no more self-deception
[01:52:54] for a long time I had lied to myself about how happy and fulfilled I felt frankly it was easier that way
[01:53:00] I even lied about things that made me feel happy and fulfilled if I just stay busy I would think
[01:53:08] maybe the story you tell yourself is a little different if I just lose a few more pounds if I just
[01:53:12] earn a few more thousand dollars this year if I can just get that guy to notice me then I'll be happy
[01:53:18] then I'll be okay when we shed those deceptive stories we tell ourselves we create a space where we're
[01:53:25] able to see what actually does make us authentically happy I bet you'll find you weren't totally off
[01:53:32] as I said we all seek some the same things love acceptance purpose we just look for them in the wrong
[01:53:40] places but I talked with Amy I knew that I had found them a sense of community friendship growth
[01:53:47] they were all right they're laid out in front of me and it was because I took a moment of quiet
[01:53:52] away from the activity and the chaos that I got to experience and appreciate it in an intentional
[01:53:57] and meaningful way intention was the key that I'd been missing I was so caught up in goals and
[01:54:04] milestones and challenges and ambitions that I'd missed the simple but profound element that makes
[01:54:09] everything worthwhile and the fact is I'm still hungry I'm still ambitious I'm still a fighter I
[01:54:16] like to push my body and do things I may not quite be ready for and how he hell yes I've still got
[01:54:21] goals and dreams but now I also have something else I believe that the single greatest key to resilience
[01:54:27] is setting intentional goals achieving a goal for the sake of vanglorian sheer accomplishment
[01:54:34] will bring satisfaction but that satisfaction will prove to be short lived achieving goals that
[01:54:39] have deep meaning to us will bring us far more happiness when we set goals that have meaning
[01:54:44] outside of our own selfish ends we discover it's not about the destination it's about the journey
[01:54:56] that's powerful and for me that part right there at the end when we set goals that have meaning
[01:55:03] outside of our own selfish ends and that's the lesson that when I when I hear travel
[01:55:11] this is story it's like oh what made his life so meaningful is that what he was doing was not for
[01:55:18] himself right everything he was doing was that he could be a leader so he could protect so he could
[01:55:26] defend yeah yeah that you know you talk about April 29 2007 is the worst day of my life but if
[01:55:40] you try to find out the worst time of my life it would be after my mom passed away
[01:55:52] it was one of those things where you know you kind of do this oh when I thought I was the
[01:56:00] when I thought Travis being killed was the woman being hit with the icicle fallin off the garage
[01:56:05] like this is like let me tell you about the craziest story I've ever heard you know like how
[01:56:12] how could my mom and my brother both not be here and through that five years I was led by my parents
[01:56:27] largely in terms of things I was doing to honor my brother but it was I don't want to say
[01:56:36] robotic but it was it was these small little things it was like okay run a marathon and it was
[01:56:41] like go to this ceremony and five years out from the loss there's still a lot of
[01:56:47] attention that's brought to that loss in in a loss of a service member I mean you're going to have
[01:56:52] you know you're going to have the local schools that want to honor them at Memorial Day you
[01:56:58] the family's want to be brought in on Veterans Day it's it's those things and they kind of like
[01:57:03] they lead you through the years and and I'll tell you what they're meaningful and they mean something
[01:57:10] and they're very much appreciated but then after my mom was killed or passed away I just felt lost
[01:57:24] I was like oh my gosh like I don't I don't know what you do from here and I just handle it the
[01:57:37] same way well okay you know Travis Manning Foundation Board of Directors three weeks after her death
[01:57:43] held the board meeting and they're like you're up you know you're the president oh well and
[01:57:48] when I joined my mom as executive director I joined my mom as a you know it was still a small
[01:57:55] organization but she takes in five years and turns it into one of the top leading non-profits for
[01:58:04] veterans in the country and they're like okay Ryan go and I'm like oh crap like I don't know
[01:58:11] how how to do this I have no idea and I always tell my husband he's going to hate that I say this
[01:58:19] I told him this is going to be the title my next book he's like no it's not but I said like I did
[01:58:24] a little like fake it till you make it so I was like okay I'm the president and and I know what I'm
[01:58:29] doing and you know this is how it's going to be and um and the first thing I did I just started like
[01:58:36] hiring really smart people I'm like okay we're the smartest people I can find and I'm going to get
[01:58:42] them and they're going to be the team of leadership that's going to make sure um that we drive this
[01:58:47] forward but then there was also this tremendous weight because here you had this organization
[01:58:56] that was named after my brother that had become like people at this point like you say Travis
[01:59:03] Manion and they know that name so there's a heavy burden to make sure you uphold the
[01:59:08] responsibility of what that name represents and then on top of it you uphold the responsibility of
[01:59:15] the woman that created it that's no longer here so I felt pressure like I had never felt before
[01:59:24] and I didn't take any steps to say okay how intentional steps to say how do I move forward doing this?
[01:59:36] It was just became the same rat race that I had been doing for the five years prior it was like okay
[01:59:41] God I keep going and that felt really tough to me I was like you know I remember sitting there the
[01:59:47] day before my mom's funeral and there was all these people around much different scene than the chaos
[01:59:53] around Travis's death I'm sitting there and I'm like I need you to do this this is my
[01:59:59] ulogy I want you to go home go back and make these revisions on the computer print it back like
[02:00:04] I was running the show I'm like I'm in charge I'm taking over I'm going to make sure all this
[02:00:09] is getting done and we do the most beautiful tribute to this woman and after that I kept going just
[02:00:20] with that same like do do do like grind every single day whatever it may be and then it was that
[02:00:28] Christmas party where and my husband again you know he's he he has some insight and he said I don't
[02:00:39] think you throwing a Christmas party this year for a hundred people is smart like we are we've got so
[02:00:47] much going on we are so incredibly overwhelmed you're so busy like let's just give it a rest I mean
[02:00:55] I think he was even like dangling you know a trip to the islands or Christmas in my face and I'm like
[02:01:01] no way you know it's all about the memories we have to have it you know and the idea that the
[02:01:09] year after my mom passes away we wouldn't have this like that's just unheard of like there's no way
[02:01:17] and so I continued in that robot robot mode like this when I got to do I have to execute this
[02:01:24] what needs to be done and it was once I hit that wall after it was done it was like that was the
[02:01:31] mecca I'd hit it and everything just came kind of crashing down and you know that panic attack that
[02:01:40] night it was I I've had anxiety a little bit you know growing up in my teens like you know
[02:01:50] what what what I should say what I thought was anxiety this was literally I thought I was dying I was
[02:01:59] like I'm I'm I'm dying here on Christmas night and and it was my husband being like in you know he's like
[02:02:06] shut up you're not dying I'm tired and it was hearing those words like I'm tired I'm like all right
[02:02:13] well clearly if I'm dying my husband's not gonna tell me he's tired and to be quiet you know and it
[02:02:18] brought me down but you know after that it was waking up every day that was one thing you know
[02:02:26] a panic attack a year or something like and I could understand that I got that it was like well yeah
[02:02:32] you had a panic attack because you've had such an adrenaline rush for the last five months building
[02:02:37] up to everything you've been doing culminating with this event that your mom used to host like
[02:02:43] I could justify a panic it made sense like your body was just having that let down and it went
[02:02:49] into an anxious response it was that idea that I was waking up every day and I woke up and
[02:02:59] upon eyes opening I wasn't crying I was like shaking and I'm like what is going on and I hit it
[02:03:05] for a while I didn't tell my husband and tell my friend like I told no one because I'm just like
[02:03:11] so you know I was like you don't want your husband to say shut up I'm tired exactly what I was like
[02:03:18] has time yeah it was not good words in most cases yeah and I'm just husbands beware yeah don't you
[02:03:24] know and and to this he's like you know here I am who am I in the book the guy that tells you to
[02:03:29] shut up when you're having a bad time and I'm like no babe what I do but it was that each and every
[02:03:39] day and I got to the point where I'm like I'm having mental health issues right now like this is
[02:03:47] not just a isolated event like something's something's happening here and to have me go sit on a
[02:03:54] couch with a therapist was like for me that was that was a big deal and a big deal because you thought
[02:04:05] you're too you're too strong for this you know it it's just like not who I was I mean I think
[02:04:10] when I opened up the first time to my dad about this it was my dad and my husband and we were in
[02:04:16] the kitchen and I said hey I'm I'm struggling I don't know what's going on with me but I'm I'm
[02:04:22] not feeling right I'm living in a perpetual state of anxiety and I don't know how to get out of it
[02:04:30] and you know at that time I I had um lorazapam it's like a low dosage Xanx that I had because
[02:04:41] I would take it when I flew you know and oh here's something just to cut the edge when you fly
[02:04:46] and next you know like I'm taking these every day and they're not even doing anything and
[02:04:51] I'm like okay so I finally break down I tell my dad and tell my dad and Dave and my dad's like
[02:05:01] first responses whoa I mean I haven't seen you working out in a while right and so I mean that and that's
[02:05:06] how I was raised and he was like you know I mean you got to go out and run and I'm like and I knew
[02:05:12] that was going to be the response and so for a while I was like well I'm not going to say anything but
[02:05:17] from there was you know and in my dad's defense you know I think after he said that I broke down
[02:05:24] and tears I'm like it's not that you know and he was like oh crap something serious is going on here
[02:05:29] and so you know I got into therapy and um and therapy helps yeah so this is something that I've realized
[02:05:39] so I used to um not really understand what therapy was or what a psychologist did or any of that
[02:05:47] and to me it just seemed like voodoo whatever kind of things right and it wasn't until a friend of
[02:05:54] mine Jordan Peterson who's a who's a psychologist came on here and he was explained to me like two
[02:05:59] two things that he solved for people and that's when I realized and I claimed a term of my own
[02:06:07] called either a mind mechanic or like brain mechanic because when your car when your car isn't running
[02:06:14] right you don't just keep driving it you go oh this isn't running right I'm going to take it to
[02:06:19] man mechanic mechanic and the mechanic actually every day sees different cars with different
[02:06:23] problems and knows how to fix them so a psychologist or a therapist they deal with people that have
[02:06:29] been through all these different things and they have little solutions for them to tell you to things
[02:06:34] to do to to get your mind in the right space so you can carry on that's what they're doing they're
[02:06:41] not doing any voodoo voodoo they're just doing some mind mechanic adjustments yeah and you can't
[02:06:48] imagine how I know for me I think my first therapy session I went in and she's asking me questions
[02:06:56] and you know it's like I'm having a conversation with a friend and then she go okay times up
[02:07:01] I'm like well when when are we going to start therapy she's like I was therapy and I'm like oh
[02:07:06] did she give you did she give you like techniques totally yeah can you give me an example of just one
[02:07:13] so you know there's like the breathing techniques of course like for me a lot of it was like the
[02:07:17] breathing because I would get to like these peaked peaked feelings of anxiety where you know it was
[02:07:24] like fighter flight and it was like breathing exercises to help get me back down so she says okay
[02:07:31] when you start feeling like that here's what you're gonna do yeah tell me what would you do uh like you
[02:07:36] know it was you know you I think one of them was like you're gonna take a deep breath in you're
[02:07:41] gonna hold it for three seconds and then you're gonna let it out for 10 seconds while holding your
[02:07:47] diaphragm so you can actually like feel the breath coming out I developed my own techniques too like
[02:07:55] I have to this day I've developed my own techniques to help when I'm feeling anxious um do you
[02:08:02] give me example one oh they're so girly but yeah um my my examples are not saying I'm gonna use it
[02:08:08] okay so so one of my examples is um most of the time and I actually don't most time I keep my
[02:08:16] my nails polished okay and I can get it oh and I'll like peel the nail polish off fun feeling
[02:08:25] super anxious but what it is more than that wait so that's a sign that you're getting anxious no no
[02:08:31] that's like if I'm super anxious so if you're super anxious you start picking it your fingernails
[02:08:35] yeah taking the nail polish off okay and I put the nail polish on because I don't want to pick
[02:08:39] the skin off my fingers so that's a that's a technique is to let's my technique it's not a okay
[02:08:45] but it's it's something that calms you somehow yeah you know what it is though I'll say it's not
[02:08:50] so much the peeling the nail polish off there it's finding something that you have to concentrate on
[02:08:56] yeah so once I pick a piece of nail polish off my finger I'm not gonna let my hands look like that
[02:09:03] so I have to get every last piece of nail polish off without nail polish remover with my with my
[02:09:09] fingers and that takes time and effort and I just become focused on that and so that it's like
[02:09:17] that sort of thing can kind of bring you into for me it brings me into a place of like I'm
[02:09:22] concentrating on this so one thing that I realize that I do is when when you're in the military
[02:09:30] when you talk on the radio you don't want to sound like you're panicking yeah yeah and so like
[02:09:34] if I was gonna keep that radio I'd be like no matter what was going on it you know whether I'm just
[02:09:39] exerting physical energy or there's chaos going on it always be like oh I'm gonna talk on the
[02:09:44] radio and I just put on the calm voice you know and I think that's when you when you say hey we need
[02:09:49] 14 more guys to come over to this building now and whatever one hears you and you hear yourself you're like
[02:09:54] okay things aren't that bad work good so I was for me we're trying to keep my voice in check
[02:10:01] and I think that leads to a sense of calmness even not not just outwardly but inwardly as well
[02:10:10] yeah I never really realized that until I started having conversations with people about this
[02:10:14] very thing because people would say how did you remain calm and I would think about it like oh just stay calm
[02:10:19] and then I thought well what let's think about it what actually and the other thing is
[02:10:24] I would tell guys you know that I was training I'd be like hey man don't you know I hear
[02:10:28] guy on the radio really need more guys over here now during a training operation and I'd say
[02:10:33] bro you need to calm down don't sound like that I'm ready freaking everyone out yeah and and they're
[02:10:37] freaking out yeah and so when I go bro don't talk like that say it again say calm they'd be like
[02:10:42] hey we need to six more guys moving forward and you could see them visibly I'd watch them
[02:10:48] they would get calmer because you have to get control so those are the kind of things that the
[02:10:54] mind mechanic will give you these tools totally and you know but for me it was it was less about
[02:11:02] staying calm it was about like I was afraid of that crescendo where literally it's that
[02:11:09] fight or flight and you don't want to go off that edge and so it was like when I get to that point
[02:11:15] what what do I do because I don't know if you've ever had an actual panic attack I had not you feel like
[02:11:21] you're dying it is the craziest feeling in the world the thing that makes me really which must
[02:11:28] make this harder right is if you like let's say you're starting to have a panic attack yeah
[02:11:33] isn't it like a snowball because you're like I'm having one you might get it coming it's coming
[02:11:38] oh my god I'm just gonna be it this could be that one so it actually it's like self
[02:11:44] propels itself to make itself work well you know I so I was saying I used to take
[02:11:49] like lorazapam when I flew you know and it was just like hey it was like my fear of you know
[02:11:56] flying right I fly so much now I'm over it but people who say were were you scared of the plane
[02:12:02] crashing and I was like no I was scared of getting too scared on the plane you know like I don't
[02:12:09] want to be on the plane and start getting scared so I'm gonna I mean it's like you're your head
[02:12:16] does crazy things you know but yeah I worked through that and you know I was very intentional
[02:12:24] about even when I felt like okay I'm coming out of this I'm feeling better it wasn't like I'm
[02:12:30] gonna stop it was like I okay I gotta keep going and I'm gonna keep going until she tells me
[02:12:38] it's you know how long did that take um it was about six months of like intensive therapy
[02:12:47] where I'm talking like I was two to three times a week and exercise so after you so exercise
[02:12:55] becomes again a big part of it but it's not exercise where I'm gonna run a marathon or I'm gonna
[02:13:01] it was like I'm gonna go out for a run every day every other day because it's what my mind
[02:13:07] needs not necessarily what my body needs I was talking to my friend Jill Rogan on his podcast
[02:13:15] right after Chris Cornell killed himself he like killed himself that day or the day before
[02:13:22] and so we started this podcast and look I mean obviously I'm no psychologist and we were just talking
[02:13:29] we weren't trying to give out advice but you know both of us was like you know gotta get some
[02:13:33] exercise and a million people said you have no idea what you're talking about like I know I'm just
[02:13:39] saying that you know it feels good to work out but then what was interesting was my other friend
[02:13:45] Tim Ferris who actually went through like a suicidal episode in his life and he's and
[02:13:53] and he's like no you have to like get outside and exercise it will make you feel better.
[02:13:58] I don't subscribe to anybody that thinks that your physical health is not 100% tied to your mental
[02:14:07] health like you know I used to think my dad was incredibly insensitive when I would try to talk
[02:14:15] to him about like you know ailments of the mind and he would tie it all back to like you know well
[02:14:21] if you ran or but you know what like he was right yeah he was right and is it all that is it like
[02:14:29] yeah hey I'm suffering from depression go run no that's not but it is it is 100% a component my
[02:14:36] husband runs every single day every day he runs and he's he's he's he's people like you
[02:14:45] gonna run the marathon he's like I'll never run a marathon again he's like I run to live my life
[02:14:50] like it's all it's all for maintenance for him it's just about like in order for me to be
[02:14:57] clear headed to be a good husband and to be a good father and to be good at my job I have to run
[02:15:03] every day so it's cool about this you know for for folks that are listening right now that are
[02:15:09] running into whatever difficulties are going through like hey cool the initial whatever the initial
[02:15:16] prescription is hey outside and then like you said it would be on that then what do we need
[02:15:24] well then you need to go and see a brain mechanic yeah which is what you said you're that hey
[02:15:28] dad it's not about running yeah yeah it's not more runny right which I probably had some conversations
[02:15:34] with like that about with my kids you know where you know my daughters they'll say like I just don't
[02:15:39] feel like doing anything right now it was like well that means you need to do something right
[02:15:42] yeah and I'm sure it's sometimes that some points are going to God my dad's an idiot
[02:15:48] yeah I mean but I want to say that you just said that you're dad which kind of supports my
[02:15:56] position you're dad was right it was right so he was right get some exercise but then if it
[02:16:01] goes beyond that and you still feel the the issues then you've got to get some some help yeah for sure
[02:16:08] um a couple more things to wrap this up along the road to intention I came across countless
[02:16:16] bumps and pitfalls but I also learned some a few valuable truths first don't use a jack hammer
[02:16:25] when a chisel will do when I saw a problem in front of me I went at it with a jack hammer I was
[02:16:32] convinced that if I applied enough force to it I could make it go away but some problems even big ones
[02:16:38] need only a well deployed chisel intention is the chisel I was introduced to intention when my mom
[02:16:45] received her eight month prognosis Travis's young life had been ripped from mine violently and quickly
[02:16:51] but in the case of my mom I was given the opportunity to say my goodbyes I asked her questions about
[02:16:57] her life and wrote down her responses we spent every day together and she held my girls every chance she
[02:17:02] got after she died all that disappeared I believed for a time that I had been robbed I was heartbroken
[02:17:12] and right back where I had started but then I relearned a lesson on intentionality I was crudely
[02:17:19] reminded of how short, sweet and precious our lives are I know the cost of not having the opportunity to
[02:17:26] say what or do what matters most and I refuse to squander the blessings that I have been given I choose
[02:17:35] to live life with in intention your next piece of advice second it's not either or it's both
[02:17:48] and let me be clear intention is not rep meant to replace girls and ambitions it's meant to
[02:17:54] call to them committing to vigorous feats physical mental or otherwise is often a good in its own right
[02:18:00] maybe you want to pass those boards or crush that personal best time or compete for that promotion
[02:18:05] these are all good things these aims are fueled by discipline and focus but they are nourished by intention
[02:18:14] difficult to attain goals and accomplishments are what keep our heart rates up in our blood pumping
[02:18:20] they give us life but intention is what gives our lives meaning it's what makes life worth living
[02:18:34] then this is your last piece of advice that I'm going to cover from the book it says failure is a bruise
[02:18:42] not a tattoo before Travis died I never bothered to think much about failure that's not because
[02:18:51] I was wildly successful everything I tried my hand at believe me I failed a plenty of things
[02:18:56] rather it was because I didn't care enough about anything to give it much effort I was sometimes
[02:19:02] apathetic Travis was ambitious Travis was the ambitious goal oriented one I was just coasting through
[02:19:09] life after he died and then my mom died I had a major wake-up call now I feel I feel compelled
[02:19:20] to take advantage of the time I have left on this earth to lead a life they both can be proud of
[02:19:28] and I think that's a good place to stop on my readings from this book to lead a life that they can
[02:19:45] be proud of because that message right there is just a powerful message and it's a one that I know
[02:19:53] that I think about every single day every single day I think about that and mind you we've only
[02:20:03] covered like a third of this book right here right there are stories and lessons from Heather and
[02:20:13] from Amy and like I said hopefully I can have them on and we can go through their lessons learned
[02:20:22] and their experiences I look forward to doing that but in the meantime for folks out there get this
[02:20:32] book and what's awesome is those stories in this book the stories the book comes to an end and we're
[02:20:40] going to end this but the story doesn't end there because Travis and Brendan and Robert are still
[02:20:45] having a huge impact and we've been talking about this the foundation that your mom started the
[02:20:51] Travis minion foundation which you are now the president of the president of yes and Amy is one of
[02:20:58] the vice presidents Amy's vice president and then Heather is a manager of program manager here in
[02:21:04] San Diego the West region yeah that's right so I mean the the lessons that you're putting now this is
[02:21:11] all in this book are awesome tell us a little bit before we before we stop tell us a little bit about
[02:21:19] the Travis minion foundation first of all like what what's the mission what's the goal
[02:21:25] I mean really at the Travis minion foundation we are we're creating a community and we want to make
[02:21:31] sure that we are giving returning veterans and families of the fallen the opportunity to continue to serve
[02:21:40] and more importantly to be able to empower them post military life I think you know when you look at
[02:21:48] today 55% of men and women who are taking off the uniform when you ask them what their greatest
[02:21:54] challenges it's that that loss of purpose you know they don't have that sense of purpose and their
[02:22:00] life anymore and we have no shortage of ways at TMF to give you purpose again and one of our
[02:22:09] biggest drivers and a lot of it is you know it's speaks to I talk about Travis as a young kid and
[02:22:14] I say like you know there was something different about him but it didn't come without having
[02:22:21] incredible mentors you know my uncle Chris my dad some of his teachers growing up the coaches
[02:22:28] Joel Sherrit at the rest of the Naval Academy is wrestling coach like these were the mentors that helped
[02:22:36] frame him into who he became and so we know the importance of that and we know the opportunity
[02:22:42] we have we have with a group of men and women who basically were taught leadership and so it's like
[02:22:51] okay so let's take this group of men and women who were taught to lead and serve and just say thanks
[02:22:57] for your service no how about like okay you're back here you're out well can you teach these
[02:23:02] kids how to leave and lead and serve so we train veterans to go out and mentor youth and they're
[02:23:09] out across the country taking them through both physical and experiential learning challenges
[02:23:19] to build their own service and leadership and not in a way to indoctrinate the next generation
[02:23:26] to all join the military but in a way to say hey listen as men and women like you and Travis and
[02:23:33] Brendan and Rob like they were called to serve this country in military but as Americans each and
[02:23:41] every one of us is called to serve like we have a responsibility to do that and if we're not
[02:23:46] passing that down to the next generation then we're failing and so that's that's kind of our
[02:23:53] drive at the foundation so we we just want to create a community that wants to pass that down
[02:23:59] and we've got eight offices across the country we've got a membership base of about 120,000 people
[02:24:07] and you know we we we call ourselves the Spartans like and we're largely made up of civilians
[02:24:13] believe it or not but these are people that feel that sense of pride for men and women like you
[02:24:21] you know and they want to be able to eat that up and be a part of it and and be servant leaders
[02:24:26] right in the room backyards and our our organization does not exist if we don't have veterans
[02:24:34] leading the charge and gold star families like they run our programs so we're not a veteran
[02:24:39] service organization in the way where we're saying these this is what we offer to you we're a
[02:24:43] veteran service organization that says hey we really want to do good stuff in the community so
[02:24:48] we need you guys to help us out yeah no it's an awesome program that that I you guys made a video
[02:24:55] we did that I'm in and I went to LA but but what's awesome is they're just
[02:25:03] they're getting to kids you know and the same idea that I had which is which is hey
[02:25:11] there's a bunch of kids in the world and what they need is to learn about life and learn about
[02:25:18] the word that you guys use which I will use as well because it's the right word is character
[02:25:23] yeah and and how do you teach these young kids character well that's you know I've written a bunch
[02:25:28] of kids books that that try to teach kids about character and the values that will the values
[02:25:34] that will give them a better life right that will give them a better life and will give everyone
[02:25:40] around them a better life as well so that's awesome the other thing that's awesome is what you
[02:25:45] just said you know me you know many times a day I get a message from someone that says hey
[02:25:51] um 52 years old and I never served and I feel like I regret it and I wish I could have
[02:25:58] what should I do it's like this is what you do yeah this is what you do you you you help
[02:26:04] propel the message and the message of character back to the veterans from the veterans back to
[02:26:10] the youth that's what you do you there's so many different ways to serve you don't have to put
[02:26:15] on a uniform to serve there's so many different ways to serve and what you guys are doing
[02:26:19] is offering and offering people the opportunity to find other ways to serve that are just as
[02:26:25] impactful I'll tell you right now you go out there and you help free kids get on the right path in
[02:26:34] their life that is the biggest service you can make to the country that's it that's it go do that
[02:26:40] that has such a massive impact and you guys are enabling that you guys are at so so if people want
[02:26:50] to if people want to get on board yeah we go to Travismanion.org Travismanion.org yeah you can
[02:26:56] join the mission right there we have it and I mean it walks you through everything like this is
[02:27:01] everything we do what do you want to be a part of you know and um yeah join the mission and learn
[02:27:06] more you're a social media because echo is really the social media so it's on Twitter it's TM
[02:27:14] foundation correct on Instagram which echo calls the gram the gram yeah it's Travismanion
[02:27:23] foundation on Facebook it's Travismanion foundation and you guys have a YouTube channel as well
[02:27:28] we do we've got great videos there's a couple of you up there actually is there more than one yeah
[02:27:32] well they broke down some of your outtakes and just did like it's like a minute long like
[02:27:38] wait is it bloopers it's not bloopers it's like thoughts from jaca like no it's cool I was
[02:27:44] gonna say I don't know how many bloopers because they had a big chunk of time like hours and hours
[02:27:49] and I was like how long it's gonna take to like what we got five hours set aside and I was like
[02:27:54] okay that's a long video yeah but it didn't take that long well it was funny because I was with
[02:28:00] Pat Chapman who was the one that that film Joe he was the producer of the the piece and he's a good friend of mine
[02:28:06] he lives in LA and he said I said oh I'm doing jacco's podcast on Friday and he said oh my gosh
[02:28:13] I have to tell you he said you know I got in the car with like I guess like the grips or whatever and he said yeah
[02:28:17] you know we're doing we're doing a shoot today this guy's name's jacco and they were like are you kidding me
[02:28:22] and he's like and these you know he's like they weren't in the military so I didn't he's like I thought it was really like heavily
[02:28:27] focused on the military he's like these are like my key grips and they were like oh my god jacco they were
[02:28:33] thrilled that's awesome yeah it's really interesting the the demographics of people at
[02:28:39] listen to podcasts it's everyone yeah it's really it's really cool and you know like they find
[02:28:45] well this is a great opportunity for them to find a way to serve because everyone feels that if you let
[02:28:49] somewhere in their system yeah if you go through your life looking out for yourself
[02:28:53] without helping other people you'll look up one day and you'll say I want to help other people
[02:28:59] that's just that's just the way it is yeah so those are the ways to help to join the mission
[02:29:06] join the way you said that I kind of got I got it been it's good psychologist that you
[02:29:11] just said you said because since I hear that I'm like what oh that I've been to join it
[02:29:14] so I'm real easy when it comes to things like that you start throwing those words around
[02:29:18] and all of a sudden I'm breaking out the knives getting ready to go to battle you see that
[02:29:22] like new mission whatever you like that you know yeah yeah well that's something that I say all
[02:29:27] the time to vats like when you get done with your military service you need a new mission totally and
[02:29:31] the people that don't get a new mission they wander around not knowing what to do so here's a good
[02:29:37] way whether you're civilian whether you're military to get on board thanks Alex keep the mission

[02:32:59] it's an honor to be able to do it thank you for coming on thanks
[02:33:01] and with that Ryan Manion has left the building awesome conversation and some good advice
[02:33:17] actual pragmatic advice on what to do how to help yourself how to help yourself do those moments
[02:33:28] part of it was part of it was goals right goals with intention to keep yourself on the path
[02:33:41] going out for runs I thought that was interesting because every time how she would say how Tom
[02:33:47] or her dad would say yeah just go off or run or whatever we kind of say that about you just to a lot
[02:33:53] of time we do this go change it's true it's true I'm not going to just I mean we just talked about it
[02:34:01] where it's true but it's not like this that antidote right you know it is for some stuff you know
[02:34:08] I wish I would have thought of this it is a little bit more of an antidote than running in my opinion
[02:34:14] I think so too but just like it's like a couple measures of effectiveness because there's a
[02:34:22] mental aspect to it that completely covers all the mental aspects of running and then gives
[02:34:28] additional bonuses yeah and then I want to imagine obviously I'm not an expert but I would imagine
[02:34:34] that it would just be this very strong person a person you know some people they would maybe go
[02:34:37] live waste I remember when I was young when I'd be mad at something and keeping mine
[02:34:43] on coi mad at something so whatever I mean we are very very mild madness sessions
[02:34:50] I would want to go workout like going to workout and getting under the bench like that would
[02:34:57] help that would be very therapeutic right Annie's to run on child milk too back not
[02:35:03] you know before not anymore but I surround on the treble too same thing very therapeutic I
[02:35:08] thought the lifting was more therapeutic and then jujitsu is like magnitudes top of the therapeutic
[02:35:15] pyramid in terms of physical activity by far too like by far like more than one level like
[02:35:22] too low so you're definitely recommending jujitsu as well you're mentioning jujitsu yes for many
[02:35:26] reasons we've talked about and we're going to continue to talk about jujitsu but when you do
[02:35:30] jujitsu you will need a uniform you will again if you're doing ghee which we do recommend as always
[02:35:37] well gear you're gonna get you're gonna I have not been getting the question one geisha that
[02:35:41] get anymore I have not been getting out there the word is getting out and we're going to continue to
[02:35:44] put it out origin geese get one of our geese and by our geese I mean us all of us to group you know
[02:35:53] because because we are part of this thing we are part of this gang and we're all using
[02:36:00] we're all supporting we're all on board with the program origin made in America
[02:36:07] materials because sometimes people say they say made in America that took me to America
[02:36:12] assembled in America what they really mean yeah or you know made in America oh yeah son and
[02:36:18] manufactured grown oh we do the raw materials all Americans without compromise
[02:36:24] geese you can get geese you can get rash guards you can get t-shirts and you can get jeans
[02:36:31] that's right American general jeans made in America and babba boots oh that's right did you get
[02:36:39] yours yet how are you feeling I feel very good about here's a when are you wearing boots though
[02:36:44] I don't wear boots so all of a sudden you just have boots when are you when are you gonna wear
[02:36:49] they're good I don't know but here's the interesting thing in this goes we need to make
[02:36:53] slippers in order yeah it's a little bit lost yeah but like anything you know when you're excited
[02:36:58] about it you know I started I forgot that in the mainland you guys call them flip flops
[02:37:02] yeah you go flip flops yeah you know like when you get an exciting new piece of a peril
[02:37:10] you more you actively look for opportunities to wear them so you know these boots they're
[02:37:16] gonna get worn official I put them on of course but I'm an old actually wear them in the field
[02:37:21] whenever that means in my case you know in some capacity you're going to the grocery store
[02:37:26] but what's cool about the roots is they're they're not for wearing a grocery store I mean you
[02:37:33] can't but they're they're legit awesome work boots made in farming to make aesthetically
[02:37:44] please I don't like to wear easy wear pleasing but you like the way they look they have legitimate
[02:37:49] aesthetics to them more and more to heavy their functionality is good yes and they're not
[02:37:55] overboard aesthetically which would give them disapproved by me in fact as far as I'm concerned
[02:38:00] they are the perfect boot yeah actually when you think about it they are a boot yeah if you look
[02:38:04] in the dictionary boot you'd see a pair of origin boots like that's what you expect a pair of boots
[02:38:10] look like just why because that's how boots have been honed over centuries to get to a
[02:38:18] point where you go okay this is what a boot is yeah the most the most boot a boot can be is a boot
[02:38:25] for more of your mansion yeah you can get that also what supplements oh yeah now it's gonna say
[02:38:32] when you're on the path supplements they help they supplement the the path discourse yes 100%
[02:38:39] but yeah so it look I slipped off the train of well not the most train but
[02:38:44] because you're right on it all day all day but I had like any crap my wife made me an incredible
[02:38:52] dinner yesterday flank steak just all just good to go nice little Caesar salad these are like
[02:38:59] my two things but the flank steak was just perfect and I got done with it and I was like yeah that was
[02:39:05] so good and I was like about I want something so I just got a little I got a little scoop of
[02:39:11] half hitter yeah that's a whole deal yeah I guess so that's like a deal in a half is one scoop
[02:39:18] right or is two- one no one one scoop is it you can have a one scoop I mean you can have a two scoop
[02:39:21] hitter for sure oh yeah that's not really it's a little bit more what is one serving one scoop one
[02:39:27] one scoop right yeah yeah so milk what it is it's additional protein but you're not gonna know
[02:39:33] what you're gonna think is you just got an additional dessert yep so the joint warfare and
[02:39:40] krill oil this is important let's look off krill oil here's the thing right I didn't like forget
[02:39:45] it I ran out I forgot to get more before I ran out it's one of those situations again so and then
[02:39:51] it's weird how this is what Jade called it it's a type or typing induced tennis elbow okay I can
[02:40:03] that makes sense right beat on the computer whenever and I got tennis elbow over here wow
[02:40:08] right when I was you was maybe like a word stuff right yeah it was like fourish days after I got
[02:40:17] off the krill oil still joint warfare I'm still into that you know elbow cured by the way
[02:40:23] but yeah that's that's that's the situation I see a man as people will ask me which one
[02:40:29] A or B you know should I be on your warfare krill oil which one should it be and I'm like
[02:40:34] I hate answering that question because as far as I'm concerned it's both it's like peanut butter and jelly right
[02:40:39] you're not just gonna go peanut butter you're not just gonna go tell you going peanut butter and
[02:40:42] you're gonna go join warfare and super krill yeah that's 100% yeah and the it and I'm on like
[02:40:51] a pro the program where it's like lifting like hard in this face I'm a little bit more old school now
[02:40:56] like I'm not as young as you see me not a start technique right but oh your old not just old school but
[02:41:01] actually old you see so yeah so this it's saying a lot when I don't have the elbow thing anymore
[02:41:11] and that was a common thing when I was lifting with no joints supplements before you did your
[02:41:16] whole thing it was a big I just endured just endured everyone's in a while take like I'd be
[02:41:22] profanous something like that it got real bad not good for you but otherwise I just warm up more now
[02:41:27] no fact they're gone aside from my tennis elbow but anyway typing elbow type
[02:41:34] in these tennis those tennis I was not playing tennis unfortunately
[02:41:37] yeah um nonetheless yes so yes join warfare krill oil mok discipline
[02:41:44] so we got the we got the jockel pommur flavor which is a 50% iced tea 50% lemonade flavor
[02:41:51] it's the greatest thing ever it's so good oh yeah it's out it's out I said I said it's soon I told
[02:42:00] I told be little I'm like as soon because I had tried the you know we went through all the trials
[02:42:05] to get the right taste when we got the right taste and I was like run this make it and I said as
[02:42:10] soon as the factory gets done making it federal express it to my house yeah because it's taste so good
[02:42:19] better than trapezoid thunder you think all right like currently it's a pinion right yeah so my
[02:42:24] opinion is yes right now right now the the powdered discipline in jockel pommur flavor is my
[02:42:34] favorite flavor at this time I'm not saying I won't occasionally do a little lemon lime hitter
[02:42:40] order trapezoid thunder and don't forget that we also have the cans right this one go and that's
[02:42:45] what I say like the cans to me I like lemon lime fine but the trapex thunder is like there's
[02:42:52] no way I would ever under any circumstances grab the lemon lime one the trapex thunder is right
[02:42:57] interesting well I mean you know I think that might be from your upbringing it's possible you know
[02:43:02] yeah it's very tropical yeah I'm sure then you need to be like over there and then you got
[02:43:11] jocquawaiti as well organic why it's the only organic consumable that is guaranteed to give you
[02:43:21] an 8000 pound deadlift so yeah after it's typically proven by the way double blind last
[02:43:26] simplicity also if you or when you get your copy of the knock at the door by Ryan Manion
[02:43:34] Heather Kelly and Amy Looney heffron in no worries I got I got you you don't have to go searching
[02:43:42] even though I'm sure that'd be easy to find regardless but put it on jockelpottcast.com under the
[02:43:47] book section and here's another good way to support the podcast if you want to click there click
[02:43:55] through there it'll take you to Amazon on that Amazon landing the where it lands just save that to
[02:44:00] your favorites if you haven't if you've done this before August first sorry we got to do it again
[02:44:08] for various reasons that we're not going to go into but nonetheless if you do that then shopping
[02:44:12] dude Amazon shopping through that link that's a good way to support this podcast very good way
[02:44:17] if you want but yeah so yeah it'll be on there and yeah get it there so you begin not only
[02:44:25] support yourself but you know get the get the whole book so you can get all the details and whatnot also
[02:44:32] jockel is a store it's called jockel store anyway that's where you can see the guy that wrote on
[02:44:39] Twitter his wife said what do you want for your birthday and he said jockel is a store it's called
[02:44:45] jockel store boom there you go you just as I'll she need you to know because everything that you
[02:44:51] can get there he's down with yeah he's like just order something from there you can order a
[02:44:55] rash guard you can order a t-shirt you can order a trucker's hat I guess if you are feeling like
[02:45:02] maybe you don't feel as cool as you want to be you can order a flex fit hat oh yeah or lightweight
[02:45:10] hoodie yeah you know ready admit it when you see people wearing the lightweight hoodie it's
[02:45:16] good you're kind of getting one over right now one over but like it's weird you're saying
[02:45:21] and I'll say probably not right now little bit though it looks good this like functional functional
[02:45:27] lightly functional and as slightly aesthetic yeah if you want to represent while you're on the path
[02:45:33] jockel store.com this way you get the stuff you can also subscribe to this podcast which is a good
[02:45:38] idea if you haven't yet which echo doesn't think you have maybe that's because echo is the type of
[02:45:45] person that is listening to something for years and doesn't hit subscribe and so he doesn't think you
[02:45:50] well you can be like echo and hit subscribe now or maybe if you're like me you already hit subscribe
[02:45:57] so we know what's interesting about that this is obviously not the first time you said that echo
[02:46:02] doesn't think that you subscribe because that's technically that's not true that's not how it
[02:46:06] went down I was not aware that I believe my own property yeah exactly so if I mean you
[02:46:13] probably just miss remembered it and then that again I could be wrong right now too and maybe I
[02:46:17] missed dinner remember correctly but what it was was I was saying you don't have to tell people to
[02:46:24] subscribe because they're either going to subscribe if they want to or not you don't be like hey
[02:46:29] subscribe and then be like oh my gosh I totally forgot to subscribe it's kind of like no
[02:46:32] obviously that that was my contention anyway so that's more accurate but additionally
[02:46:38] today you put a lot of things on me didn't well do you say that I called it the gram that whole
[02:46:46] line of the gram whatever you say echo this echo that was interesting you say I'm not taking ownership
[02:46:52] of things oh yeah that's true too yeah which is interesting yeah but I'm just I'm actually
[02:46:58] it's nothing to take ownership I'm not blaming you for calling it the gram I'm just stating that you
[02:47:03] call it the gram even though I don't yeah it's almost time for me to read some reviews
[02:47:14] allowed again done that before but yeah so leave some reviews if you leave a review that's
[02:47:20] shockingly creative and good then you know maybe I'll just retweet it or something or read it
[02:47:28] I also want to do the I also want to read YouTube comments allowed yeah we should do like what there's
[02:47:34] a show like I don't know I forget there's a bunch of shows like that yeah mean tweet me
[02:47:39] yeah yeah yeah you should do that with the with the and not necessarily mean ones because
[02:47:44] mean ones people can be lame will you I'm not gonna be like this guy said that yeah you know
[02:47:50] here's a people cry during mean tweets or I've seen some people crying when they're reading
[02:47:54] mean tweets like really crying yeah yeah like legitimate we like like you know like to show the
[02:47:59] power of internet bullying or whatever okay so they're not gonna get me there yeah but oh well I
[02:48:05] would I would wonder is obviously yeah you're not gonna start crying but if you show yeah I'm gonna
[02:48:10] read it then people would be like oh let me make a mean one and then sometimes if someone's intention
[02:48:16] I have to say if you're if you're gonna try and be mean to me through comments yeah
[02:48:21] because you're not having negative impact on me I hate to break the news to you you're not
[02:48:25] executing well because I don't care yeah actually you want to write something cool
[02:48:30] and you want me to see it and be like I'll awesome then that didn't you're being effective yes
[02:48:36] no but this though is what you're saying what it like if you if we decide for you to read
[02:48:42] mean comments uh people someone might be motivated to be like oh let me see if I can get a zinger
[02:48:52] in there and then it's just sort of whack because for a mean comment to be funny it has to be funny
[02:48:58] first then mean said here's the here's the really here's the really kind of just
[02:49:04] thing that shuts that idea down to to to read a mean like a truly mean comment it's not even
[02:49:11] it's not funny you know what I mean you make a funny comment right like the person that got a picture
[02:49:16] of me and it says uh feeling cute might like like hey man that's just funny you know full
[02:49:25] credit to that one because it's a model that was evil echo Charles that picked picture that
[02:49:30] oh yeah evil echo Charles posted that but yes so that picture was taken about three seconds
[02:49:37] before because this photographer this is a legit photographer was taking pictures of me
[02:49:42] and they're like photoshoot yeah you were muddling yeah no they were taking pictures of me
[02:49:47] oh well so anyways they're like I'm like just they're like we'll just walk around and act natural
[02:49:52] and so I'm like walk around and I'm like looking I'm looking in this in this pit right where that
[02:49:58] fences and then I I look at them and then and then they're like taking too much pictures and then they
[02:50:04] started giving me direction yeah that's modeling they're like they're like wait can you look
[02:50:08] over there and then look at us real quick give me that and then I was like no I'm not doing that this
[02:50:15] is this is not me and I'm not doing it but that picture was the one picture that they got right
[02:50:19] before they started giving me directions and I and I told them negative not happening but even that
[02:50:24] picture looks lame man that's debatable you know maybe you know it looked cute might be lead it later
[02:50:30] hey bottom line leave some reviews you know we have fun with them we appreciate cool reviews so
[02:50:35] that'd be awesome and don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast which I know I owe more of
[02:50:41] this is starting to sound really bad yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah maybe we should release that one in the
[02:50:46] bank sure okay um yeah so Warrior Kid podcast and don't forget about the Warrior Kid soap
[02:50:52] from Irish Oaks Ranch.com where young Aiden is making soap so that you and we all can stay
[02:51:00] clean. Speaking of course also YouTube channel we have YouTube channel video version of this podcast
[02:51:05] and excerpts a lot excerpts on there let's get a little you know chopped them here's the thing
[02:51:11] about YouTube is what I heard when I learned people now people now are going to YouTube more for a
[02:51:19] little bit longer videos than before. Remember the trend was like oh yeah I'm in it and a half it's
[02:51:24] like you got to keep their attention on the internet and stuff that was kind of the thing right
[02:51:27] apparently the new emergent status is the people we like the longer forms stuff we're
[02:51:37] beginning to let you're just catching up with that over there yes isn't this like we've been
[02:51:42] making three hour podcast for years but remember we have a lot of podcasts well no no okay
[02:51:49] three-hour podcasts that's audio right we're talking audio long for okay but yes there is video
[02:51:54] you have we have a five hour and twenty five minute long podcast which on par now yes but as far as
[02:52:00] the trend goes people like it generally speaking more also people outside of the people that
[02:52:05] listen to this podcast are starting to like okay just yeah in general and so what's your point
[02:52:10] of the details of this so somebody excerpts are kind of like five minutes eight minutes
[02:52:15] so that's 12 minutes right right so the times that I was telling you can you please make an
[02:52:19] excerpt that's not 27 minutes long you're saying I was wrong well I'm not to split hairs
[02:52:27] I'm not saying you were wrong then I'm saying that no longer applies as far as like what you might want
[02:52:34] nonetheless there's some excerpts on there well for YouTube channel if you want something shorter than that
[02:52:40] you can go to psychological warfare which is available on iTunes and all MP3 platforms which is me
[02:52:46] giving some short maybe minute minute and a half maybe two minutes at the longest audio advice of
[02:52:53] how to stay on the path and it's not just advice it's actual mechanical tool that will keep you on the
[02:52:59] path very very effective too it's like you're you could go to a therapist to try and get you to
[02:53:07] not eat a donut or you could just press play yeah but there's a donut here the sugar coated lies

[02:53:41] right in that you're not yeah okay yeah I was gonna make a video of like myself where you
[02:53:50] and be like hey like Dakota I see Dakota Myers helicopter it's like so cool so we decided to get
[02:53:57] our own and then we'd get it and then we'd either like or you get in there and you take off and
[02:54:03] then you'd like crash it or something or before you get any catches on fire something you know kind of like
[02:54:08] you want to copy people but you're you know you failed at it or something so are we having a meeting right
[02:54:13] now about creative ideas about it is that was coming on right actually technically I wanted to say
[02:54:17] it out loud just to see your reaction to see where I need to spin this idea you know
