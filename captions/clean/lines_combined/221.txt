00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.12 This is Jockel Podcast number 221 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:09.52 --> 00:00:21.36 June 15th, 2010. Members of the selection committee. It is with absolute conviction that I give my
00:00:21.36 --> 00:00:28.72 strongest possible personal recommendation to Jonathan Y Kim's selection for medical school.
00:00:30.48 --> 00:00:36.80 There is no one more qualified to make this recommendation than me. As Jonathan was under my
00:00:36.80 --> 00:00:43.44 direct supervision as a US Navy SEAL combat medic while I commanded SEAL Team 3 tasking
00:00:43.44 --> 00:00:50.08 abuser during the Battle of Ramadi Operation Iraqi Freedom from April until October 2006.
00:00:52.16 --> 00:00:58.000 During this time, the city of Ramadi was the epicenter of the insurgency and a place filled with
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.24 fear, violence, casualties, and death. In that brutal and unforgiving environment,
00:01:08.24 --> 00:01:16.32 Jonathan's undontant courage, tenacious devotion to duty and superb skills as a combat
00:01:16.32 --> 00:01:25.76 medic were tested and proven over and over again. On one particular occasion, he and a small
00:01:25.76 --> 00:01:30.96 element of other SEAL combat advisors were leading a patrol of Iraqi soldiers through an enemy
00:01:30.96 --> 00:01:38.96 controlled sector of Ramadi. The patrol was ferociously ambushed, leaving an Iraqi soldier
00:01:38.96 --> 00:01:46.80 severely wounded and lying helpless in the street. Jonathan and another SEAL who had taken
00:01:46.80 --> 00:01:53.04 refuge from the enemy gunfire behind a concrete wall left their safe position and stormed
00:01:53.04 --> 00:02:00.88 forward into the hail of enemy bullets. They then dragged the wounded soldier under intense enemy
00:02:00.88 --> 00:02:06.80 fire back to a secure position where Jonathan immediately began performing combat trauma care
00:02:06.80 --> 00:02:15.28 on the Iraqi soldier. Another Iraqi soldier was then wounded by enemy fire. And Jonathan provided
00:02:15.28 --> 00:02:24.80 medical care to him as well, eventually organizing the casualty evacuation for the wounded men.
00:02:24.80 --> 00:02:30.80 Jonathan was awarded the Silver Star Medal in recognition of his bold courage under enemy fire.
00:02:33.84 --> 00:02:37.68 That level of heroism and bravery was not an isolated incident.
00:02:37.68 --> 00:02:44.64 On another occasion, Jonathan exposed himself to enemy sniper fire in order to attend
00:02:44.64 --> 00:02:49.36 to one of his SEAL-Potune mates who had been severely wounded by an enemy sniper round
00:02:49.36 --> 00:02:51.20 that had struck the SEAL in the face.
00:02:53.76 --> 00:02:58.40 Exposing himself to the enemy sniper fire that had just wounded his fellow SEAL
00:02:58.40 --> 00:03:03.12 and with blatant disregard for his own personal safety, Jonathan moved to the fallen SEAL
00:03:03.12 --> 00:03:10.88 stabilized the patient and organized the evacuation. For this action, he was awarded the
00:03:10.88 --> 00:03:19.52 Bronze Star Medal with combat distinguishing device. Jonathan's bold courage
00:03:20.32 --> 00:03:27.20 calm decisiveness and intrinsic desire to provide care to the wounded even under the most intense
00:03:27.20 --> 00:03:35.92 urban combat imaginable continued for our entire deployment. Even as combat fatigue said in
00:03:35.92 --> 00:03:42.72 on many of the men as they saw their teammates, friends and brothers and arms wounded or killed
00:03:42.72 --> 00:03:52.08 time and time again, Jonathan never faltered. I know that the horrors of combat have shown
00:03:52.08 --> 00:04:00.72 Jonathan more stress and chaos than most will ever see. I also know that he handled that stress
00:04:00.72 --> 00:04:06.80 and chaos with a calmness of heart and a steadiness of mind that any man would admire.
00:04:10.40 --> 00:04:16.48 As further evidence of this, after his deployment to Ramadi with task in a bruiser,
00:04:16.48 --> 00:04:21.20 Jonathan was recognized for his stellar performance when he was selected as United States
00:04:21.20 --> 00:04:30.16 Special Operations Command medic of the year for 2006. Jonathan has now applied his strong
00:04:30.16 --> 00:04:35.36 work ethic and sharp intellect to college where he is performing with equal distinction,
00:04:35.36 --> 00:04:43.04 having earned a 3.98 grade point average. His remarkable aptitude for math and science is
00:04:43.04 --> 00:04:52.56 reflected in his standing on the mortar board honor society, the deans list and first honors role.
00:04:53.12 --> 00:04:59.04 Additionally, his dedication to services represented in the many hours he has spent as a volunteer
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:02.96 at both sharp memorial hospital and Balboa naval hospital.
00:05:02.96 --> 00:05:12.88 This academic prowess willingness to serve selflessness and duty and personal will to
00:05:12.88 --> 00:05:18.16 accomplish the mission even in the most severe combat situations are qualities so unique
00:05:18.16 --> 00:05:22.000 that I cannot fathom a more exemplary candidate for medical school.
00:05:24.88 --> 00:05:30.80 I am completely confident he will excel both in school and in the field and will make
00:05:30.80 --> 00:05:37.36 not only Harvard proud but also provide the finest and most compassionate medical care to
00:05:37.36 --> 00:05:41.76 every patient blessed enough to come under his charge.
00:05:44.48 --> 00:05:50.56 I would be more than happy to answer any questions about Jonathan Kim and his unlimited potential.
00:05:50.56 --> 00:06:00.72 Since nearly John G. Willink commander, naval special warfare group one training detachment.
00:06:06.64 --> 00:06:15.04 And that right there was a letter of recommendation. I wrote four, Jonathan Kim,
00:06:15.04 --> 00:06:23.68 otherwise known as Johnny Kim, for his acceptance into Harvard Medical School.
00:06:25.68 --> 00:06:30.32 And this was after I wrote him a letter of recommendation to be commissioned as an officer in the navy.
00:06:30.32 --> 00:06:33.12 And after I sat on his board for the commissioning program.
00:06:36.24 --> 00:06:41.12 But before I wrote him a recommendation for acceptance into NASA to become an astronaut.
00:06:41.12 --> 00:06:47.36 And Johnny was accepted into the officer program. He was accepted into college. He was accepted into Harvard.
00:06:48.40 --> 00:06:54.96 And he was accepted into NASA to become an astronaut. And it was easy to write those letters of
00:06:54.96 --> 00:07:05.60 recommendation because the person that Johnny was and is simply an outstanding individual in every way.
00:07:05.60 --> 00:07:13.12 And it was an honor to work with him and task unit bruiser. And it's an honor to have Johnny Kim here with us
00:07:13.12 --> 00:07:18.88 tonight to talk about his life and his lessons learned. And he's a humble guy. So I already know he's going to be
00:07:18.88 --> 00:07:25.92 mad at me for opening up with that grandiose letter of recommendation from all those years ago.
00:07:26.80 --> 00:07:32.64 But I will say Johnny, you brought it on yourself by achieving so much. So Johnny,
00:07:32.64 --> 00:07:39.52 welcome and thanks for coming on, Dennis. It's pretty bizarre to be sitting here with you right now
00:07:39.52 --> 00:07:45.68 after all these years. It is. Thank you for having me here. It's an honor to be here and thank you for the
00:07:45.68 --> 00:07:53.92 kind and generous and also undeserving words. I mean, listening to that story, it seems a world away.
00:07:54.72 --> 00:08:00.48 But at the same time, it seems like it just happened. Yeah, that's the way I think that's the way
00:08:00.48 --> 00:08:07.68 life is. And I think that's the way military for me. My military career is in chunks. And you know,
00:08:07.68 --> 00:08:13.04 I spent a chunk of time at Seal team one as a new guy. Then I spent a chunk of time at Seal team two
00:08:13.04 --> 00:08:17.20 as a young person. Then I spent a chunk of time in college. Then a chunk of time here. And
00:08:18.40 --> 00:08:24.16 those those chunks can be years long. But sometimes they just seem like they went by in 15 minutes.
00:08:24.16 --> 00:08:33.36 So, man, your story, which you're really just in the middle of right now, I guess. Let's just go back to the
00:08:33.36 --> 00:08:39.84 beginning and go through, you know, growing up and what that was like and we'll get through the teams.
00:08:39.84 --> 00:08:43.44 We'll get all the way up to sitting at this table, which, like you said earlier, is very strange for
00:08:43.44 --> 00:08:47.44 you and me to be in this position. And I don't think you want to let's ever thought we would sit
00:08:47.44 --> 00:08:53.92 doing what we're doing right now. Never. Let's do it. Right on, man. So where are you born?
00:08:54.64 --> 00:08:58.80 Los Angeles, California. And what was the scenario you grew up in?
00:09:00.08 --> 00:09:07.36 Yeah. So, first generation Korean American, my parents immigrated to the states. In the early 80s,
00:09:07.36 --> 00:09:19.60 a couple years before I was born, I was born in 84. And growing up for me was, there were some hard times
00:09:19.60 --> 00:09:29.20 growing up. I mean, I have always kept my growth, my childhood, close to the chest, even. Some of my closest
00:09:29.20 --> 00:09:35.36 friends I've never told how I grew up. No, it wasn't out of shame or anything, but I think it was
00:09:35.36 --> 00:09:42.64 a little bit, I think it's always been private for me. And it's been a part of my identity. And
00:09:43.44 --> 00:09:53.12 for a lot of the same reasons why I wanted to be a seal that freed we swore to to never really
00:09:54.32 --> 00:09:59.36 to do the things we do and not seek recognition for it. I've never, in that same vein, I never wanted
00:09:59.36 --> 00:10:12.88 to tell my story. But my dad was hard worker. He was uneducated. I think he, I don't know if
00:10:12.88 --> 00:10:20.72 he finished high school. But he grew up in a poor rural area in South Korea. And my mother was
00:10:20.72 --> 00:10:30.80 from a middle or well-to-do class family in South Korea. Her father, my grandfather, was a professor
00:10:30.80 --> 00:10:39.92 at Seoul University. And so they came over here and my dad worked for what he didn't have for education.
00:10:39.92 --> 00:10:49.92 He more than made up for with just pure grit and work ethic. And like a lot of Korean Americans,
00:10:49.92 --> 00:10:58.72 especially in Los Angeles, he owned a liquor store in downtown Los Angeles near South Central.
00:10:59.92 --> 00:11:09.84 And I think a lot of what I have become a lot of the decisions I've made in my life
00:11:09.84 --> 00:11:20.40 started with my father. And growing up, my father had, he had a lot of demons.
00:11:22.08 --> 00:11:30.40 Like a lot of people on the think he did the best he could to live within those, to live with those
00:11:30.40 --> 00:11:40.72 demons. But a lot of times he didn't have the mental strength to really not let those demons get
00:11:40.72 --> 00:11:50.08 a hold of him. And so much of what I've learned in my life has been what not to do by example
00:11:50.08 --> 00:12:01.12 of my father. And growing up, I mean, it seems, it just seems a different life to me now.
00:12:01.52 --> 00:12:07.92 Because I've had different experiences, so many humbling experiences. And I think about where I came from.
00:12:08.64 --> 00:12:15.44 It seems like a big accident. This seems like an accident to be sitting here with you talking about this.
00:12:15.44 --> 00:12:22.24 Everything I've done is an accident. Being a seal was an accident. Going to medical school,
00:12:22.24 --> 00:12:27.36 being a physician, being a national, those were all accidents, not part of the plan at all.
00:12:29.12 --> 00:12:35.52 All I wanted to do is to gain growing up was protect my family. Protect really my mother and
00:12:35.52 --> 00:12:46.08 my brother from my father. It was very abusive. And like a lot of family suffered from alcoholism.
00:12:47.84 --> 00:12:54.88 It's a pretty bad alcoholism. So when you were, when you were experienced that growing up at what age
00:12:54.88 --> 00:13:05.36 did you recognize that this was not normal? And it's hard to put a number on when I
00:13:05.36 --> 00:13:12.56 knew it was not normal. But I remember at a very young age having that feeling to protect my brother.
00:13:12.56 --> 00:13:18.80 My younger brother from it, you know, when the fights were going on or when the abuse is going on
00:13:18.80 --> 00:13:24.56 to try and shield him from it. Or, and I have a very distinct memory of actually trying to protect my
00:13:24.56 --> 00:13:33.60 mother one time and it didn't go well. And my mother also telling me to never do that again.
00:13:35.20 --> 00:13:37.92 Because I had a love. I should have not want to see me get hurt.
00:13:41.28 --> 00:13:48.56 And then at what age, at some age did you get to a point where you could step in and defend your
00:13:48.56 --> 00:13:58.64 mom? You know, yeah, I'm sorry to talk about such heavy things. And you get a, you get a
00:13:58.64 --> 00:14:06.48 podcast, but you know, you wanted to know how it all started off. Yeah, you know, that's why
00:14:06.48 --> 00:14:13.36 when I think about my life growing up, I was, I was a different, I was scared, I was a scared,
00:14:13.36 --> 00:14:19.04 little boy, scared of the world, scared of relationships, scared of talking to people,
00:14:19.60 --> 00:14:26.40 going to school, of having my own opinions of speaking up or fighting for what I believe is right.
00:14:26.40 --> 00:14:38.72 I was so scared, I was definitely scared my father. And, you know, it's just living on,
00:14:38.72 --> 00:14:45.52 living on egg shells to make sure to pray, you know, I pray every night, hoping that things
00:14:45.52 --> 00:14:58.80 would get better or that my, that my father would see the light and, you know, all those experiences
00:14:58.80 --> 00:15:07.20 while they were terrible at the time, I wouldn't take, I wouldn't trade any of that for anything,
00:15:07.20 --> 00:15:15.84 I would never want to trade that. Because everything that happened helped,
00:15:16.56 --> 00:15:22.000 formed me to the person I am today. And we'll talk about it, the teams helped
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:32.40 channel that into good. So what point did you hear about the teams?
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:45.68 So I was 16 years old and I would say being lost was probably a good description of how I felt
00:15:45.68 --> 00:15:52.16 up until that time. And I was, you know, it's like a martial arts thing with my buddies. And I was mostly
00:15:52.16 --> 00:15:58.72 just doing, because a couple of my buddies, Ryan Calam, some Keith Blum, were big into martial arts
00:15:58.72 --> 00:16:05.84 and I wanted to just hang out. And my buddy Keith told me with passion I've never seen before
00:16:05.84 --> 00:16:14.80 about the seal teams, about an ABCL. And this is 1999 or 2000. This is like no one knew what
00:16:14.80 --> 00:16:20.08 a seal is. It's a pre-911. I never heard what a seal was. And he told me with this passion about
00:16:20.80 --> 00:16:26.64 that quiet professional, that warrior that does these hard things that no one else wants to do,
00:16:27.28 --> 00:16:32.40 it never seeks recognition for those actions. And there was something about that,
00:16:33.12 --> 00:16:41.04 about that creed that deru me in a way I've never felt before. It called for me. And, you know,
00:16:41.04 --> 00:16:47.52 so I went home and went on my 56K modem and read everything I could about what it was as seal is.
00:16:48.56 --> 00:16:56.56 And I read a book that was pretty formative for me. It was the men with green faces by Gene
00:16:56.56 --> 00:17:04.32 Wenz. And my decision was made. And like this is what I'm going to do. And a week after discovering
00:17:04.32 --> 00:17:09.44 what it was, I told my mom, I'm going to be, I'm going to be an ABCL.
00:17:09.44 --> 00:17:13.36 And she had no idea what it was. You had to explain it to her. I assume.
00:17:13.36 --> 00:17:17.20 I mean, she just, she didn't know what it was. She just knew it was being
00:17:19.44 --> 00:17:25.68 a warrior, some type of soldier, an operator. And it was the last thing she wanted to hear from me.
00:17:26.40 --> 00:17:30.80 Did you get drawn to it? I mean, imagine, like, you know, you're saying that your whole life
00:17:30.80 --> 00:17:36.64 you felt scared and you felt weak and scared of your dad. Did you think, hey, if I do this,
00:17:36.64 --> 00:17:44.000 it's going to allow me give me the capability to protect people, including my mom.
00:17:44.48 --> 00:17:50.32 Absolutely. That is completely on point. You know, when people ask me why I want to be
00:17:50.32 --> 00:17:54.80 seal, it's so easy to come up with the superficial reasons. Like, yeah, I wanted to get paid to blow
00:17:54.80 --> 00:18:02.000 up stuff and jump out of planes and surf my country and shoot guns. But those are all fake
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.84 superficial reasons. I didn't, those are absolute pluses, but that is not why I wanted to be a team guy.
00:18:08.64 --> 00:18:13.28 I wanted to be a team guy for what you said. I wanted to transform my life. I wanted
00:18:14.08 --> 00:18:20.72 to learn the skills, to develop the strength, to become a different person, to find my identity,
00:18:21.84 --> 00:18:26.24 be someone that could protect the people that I loved that couldn't protect themselves.
00:18:26.24 --> 00:18:33.84 And now that I have more awareness of human psychology and the experiences in our environment and
00:18:33.84 --> 00:18:42.64 how it shapes us into the people we become and the decision to we make, I realized that it was completely
00:18:42.64 --> 00:18:52.000 born out of my situation with my father and wanting to protect my brother and my mother and that
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.96 extending to really all people. I thought, this is nice, it goes to show how little we know
00:18:59.68 --> 00:19:08.32 when we are young. I thought that being a seal would solve all of my life's problems.
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.76 And it gave clarity and focus to so many, but it probably created just as many more.
00:19:17.76 --> 00:19:25.68 But it gave me tools to deal with those problems. But it was pretty naive thought,
00:19:25.68 --> 00:19:31.36 and I even said it to my mother. I said, being a seal will solve all of life's problems.
00:19:33.60 --> 00:19:38.32 Were you, so you're in high school, are you, are you doing sports or anything like that?
00:19:40.32 --> 00:19:46.64 Yeah, so I was a big swimmer, I played Waterpolo and after I found out what it was to be a team guy,
00:19:46.64 --> 00:19:55.04 I did all my research and I, what's a Stu Smith who I recently learned is in the world of
00:19:55.04 --> 00:20:02.48 kind of like making fitness, Navy Seal guidelines and workout plans. I found his book which is
00:20:02.48 --> 00:20:08.56 maybe like the first like first edition or second, you might be a later edition now and like
00:20:08.56 --> 00:20:14.56 did all those workouts and then you know, did it twice through and just tried to push myself
00:20:14.56 --> 00:20:20.56 every day after school and doing, I went to Hatsana, Marga High School, so the beach was three blocks away.
00:20:20.56 --> 00:20:25.84 So always doing swims and runs and a lot of calisthenics, a lot of pushups.
00:20:25.84 --> 00:20:31.28 Was you, what about school? Were you paying attention to school? Were you academically focused?
00:20:32.08 --> 00:20:38.48 I was, I felt like I was going through the motions of school and I did pretty well.
00:20:38.48 --> 00:20:45.84 And I always got straight A's, I did pretty well but I knew college was not for me. I did,
00:20:46.80 --> 00:20:51.04 I was lost, I didn't know what I wanted to do after high school but I knew it wasn't college.
00:20:51.68 --> 00:20:57.44 And so when I heard about the teams that calling, so this is what I'm going to do and it was
00:20:58.80 --> 00:21:01.84 it's too date, it is the strongest calling I've had.
00:21:01.84 --> 00:21:07.84 Yeah, there's, I have conversations with people a lot and
00:21:09.12 --> 00:21:14.000 man, that idea that you should go to college right after you get done with high school.
00:21:14.72 --> 00:21:19.12 I don't know if that's the best idea for everyone. I mean for some people it works, I get it,
00:21:19.12 --> 00:21:24.56 but you're a class example, I'm a class example, I mean when I ended up going to college later,
00:21:24.56 --> 00:21:29.52 hey, this is fine, you know, you're you're disciplined, you're focused, you can get stuff done,
00:21:29.52 --> 00:21:33.36 but yeah coming out of high school, I would have been just, you know,
00:21:34.24 --> 00:21:39.04 the focus is not there, you're not there for the right reasons. I think everything you do in life should
00:21:39.04 --> 00:21:45.44 be for the right reasons. In going to school after high school because that's what your parents told
00:21:45.44 --> 00:21:50.72 you to do and that's like the next default. It may work for some people, I don't think it's
00:21:50.72 --> 00:21:54.64 necessarily the right decision for a lot of people, like you said we're both prime examples of that,
00:21:54.64 --> 00:21:59.92 I think we both went to a new grad in our later years in life, I was like 26 or 27 when I went to
00:21:59.92 --> 00:22:04.88 undergrad. Were you worried about when you went in the Navy that you weren't going to be around your
00:22:04.88 --> 00:22:08.56 mom, you weren't going to be around your little brother, were you worried about them with your dad?
00:22:10.56 --> 00:22:15.76 I would have been, but my father actually passed away before I joined the Navy so I didn't have,
00:22:16.40 --> 00:22:22.16 I didn't have that worry. What age was that? How old were you?
00:22:22.16 --> 00:22:30.24 I just turned 18. So it was close. Yeah, it was close. February 21st, 2002.
00:22:31.92 --> 00:22:38.88 And was that, I mean, that had to be a weird feeling of this guy that had been abusive to you,
00:22:38.88 --> 00:22:44.48 your brother, your mom, and but he's still your dad. I mean, how did you, how did you,
00:22:44.48 --> 00:22:55.60 how do you wash out those feelings? Oh, it's a complex question. And just, you know, I,
00:22:57.12 --> 00:23:02.72 I want to be clearly, I have no ill feelings against my father and I have forgiven him
00:23:03.60 --> 00:23:11.04 of the years of abuse that he gave. And when I grew a little bit older and I entered,
00:23:11.04 --> 00:23:18.08 where he came from, he also came from a pretty terrible home situation. And I think his demons,
00:23:18.08 --> 00:23:24.24 he just didn't have the tools or the aptitude, the mental strength, the deal with those demons.
00:23:24.24 --> 00:23:29.92 And like a lot of people, they passed those on, right? The sins of our father passed on to us.
00:23:29.92 --> 00:23:39.76 And I don't fault him. And with the abuse, most of it was directed at my mother, you know,
00:23:39.76 --> 00:23:45.20 verbal and the physical abuse. I mean, it was not as direct with us. I mean,
00:23:46.08 --> 00:23:52.32 certainly there was, you know, the belts to the feet. And I remember,
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.24 always kind of being scared to go to sleep sometimes because, you know, there were times
00:24:02.24 --> 00:24:08.80 where being woken up with a cold glass of water to the face was what would happen, or being woken
00:24:08.80 --> 00:24:15.20 up and being asked what of my possessions I had to choose what he would break. And front of me
00:24:15.92 --> 00:24:19.84 and I understand a lot of that was just to hurt my mother and he did a good job of doing that.
00:24:19.84 --> 00:24:25.60 And so he saw that hurting his children was the best way to actually hurt his mother.
00:24:25.60 --> 00:24:33.52 My mother was a very strong woman and so physically, or verbally, I'm using her, to a point.
00:24:33.52 --> 00:24:39.20 I was like, well, just bring it, it's not, but hurt my children. It's going to crush me. You know,
00:24:41.76 --> 00:24:49.12 when my father died, it, I feel like it was the day I was reborn into someone else.
00:24:50.48 --> 00:24:55.44 And I would probably have to backtrack and tell you the context of why I feel that way.
00:24:55.44 --> 00:25:04.72 I'm going to go back to my mother's life. Towards the later years of high school, my mother had
00:25:05.76 --> 00:25:12.64 had enough of the life she had been experiencing. And she would have left my father long ago,
00:25:12.64 --> 00:25:20.24 but it was really us, my brother, her Jeff, that she couldn't leave behind to my father. And there's
00:25:20.24 --> 00:25:25.60 no way my father would have left her, let her leave with us that was not going to happen.
00:25:26.64 --> 00:25:34.88 So, but there was time where she just couldn't be in the same household. So, for months at a time,
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.08 she had worked at, or that she would actually sleep at a friend's house or go away.
00:25:40.72 --> 00:25:45.60 So at night time when my father came back, you know, the food, like my mother would prepare dinner
00:25:45.60 --> 00:25:51.52 and food, but she would be somewhere else. And this arrangement was going on and I think my father
00:25:52.24 --> 00:25:58.64 obviously not very happy with the situation. I thought it would go back to normal because
00:25:58.64 --> 00:26:01.92 there had been a period of time where my mother would leave for a little bit, but it always came back
00:26:01.92 --> 00:26:07.52 because like a lot of abuse and relationship, it's hard to leave that, right? And especially when
00:26:07.52 --> 00:26:13.04 the abuse or promises, they'll change and may change temporarily, but then goes back to their ways
00:26:13.04 --> 00:26:20.64 to classics story. But this time was a little bit different and I think my father knew that this
00:26:20.64 --> 00:26:27.12 time was different and was getting frustrated and I think seeing that there were little options
00:26:28.16 --> 00:26:35.12 left and I think maybe felt cornered and I think cornered animals can be dangerous.
00:26:36.24 --> 00:26:40.000 We were very dangerous, not that I think he was cornered but I think he felt that way.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:54.32 So on this particular day, I think it was February 21st, 2002, I was home with my mother and
00:26:54.88 --> 00:26:59.20 it was during the day and my father came home and he was supposed to be at work so I think it was
00:26:59.20 --> 00:27:08.48 a little surprising. And I remember when he came home, I could smell the whiskey on his breath
00:27:08.48 --> 00:27:19.84 so I know he was new, he was very intoxicated and it was just, I could feel something was different
00:27:19.84 --> 00:27:31.04 this time. There was attention and I knew I had to stick around and my mother was surprised and
00:27:31.04 --> 00:27:39.20 scared to see him there and they went the kitchen and I stuck close by in the couch in the living room.
00:27:40.96 --> 00:27:49.76 And I remember my father came out to me and some of the last words he said to me was, I'm sorry,
00:27:49.76 --> 00:28:00.24 Jonathan, I need to be afraid of my face and then all I hear in the kitchen is my mother
00:28:01.04 --> 00:28:10.80 screaming for help and saying he's got it gone. So I then, you know, fight or flight, you do what
00:28:10.80 --> 00:28:20.40 you need to do to protect the people you love. So I got up and I did my best to fight him and get that
00:28:20.40 --> 00:28:32.08 gun and fought as hard as I could as strong as I guess 140 pound your old kid could do at the time.
00:28:32.08 --> 00:28:42.48 But I lost that fight, I still have a scar right around here from when my father was
00:28:43.36 --> 00:28:50.64 he was able to get a hold of a dumbbell nearby and smash my head in with it and I think they
00:28:50.64 --> 00:28:59.52 kind of turned the fight and he was able to get his gun out of his pocket. He shot it in the air
00:28:59.52 --> 00:29:10.40 and it was, you know, that was the first time in my life that I faced a life or death situation
00:29:10.40 --> 00:29:17.76 and as you and I know there were many more to come later but for different reasons but this was my
00:29:17.76 --> 00:29:26.40 first taste of it and I don't know how maybe but I had the grace of God or something that I said,
00:29:26.40 --> 00:29:35.20 you know, I more clearly pleading with him that we loved him and that he didn't have to do this
00:29:35.20 --> 00:29:42.000 and that it wasn't. I'm clearly remember saying that it's not too late. Like this you have
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:52.64 you have the power to decide right now it's not too late and I think maybe clarity or grace
00:29:52.64 --> 00:30:00.000 in a moment of clarity that my father found he decided not to shoot us not to kill us and I told
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:09.12 them to go run just run and he did he went he left the back door and that was the last time I saw my father
00:30:13.20 --> 00:30:19.52 you know after that in the hysteria of that my mother was on the phone and called my one one
00:30:19.52 --> 00:30:26.64 and screaming for help and so eventually ambulances came and police came and I got you know I got
00:30:26.64 --> 00:30:33.04 my head stapled at the hospital I came back and the police were there right a report and I
00:30:33.76 --> 00:30:41.44 came back and to my room and I noticed that things had shifted I have a closet that has access to
00:30:41.44 --> 00:30:48.16 the attic and I noticed that there were furniture was moved in such a way to gain access to the
00:30:48.16 --> 00:30:55.44 attic and I told police that I think my father's still in the house and he's in the attic
00:30:57.12 --> 00:31:05.68 so they they did what they're trying to do they section off the area and confronted my father and
00:31:05.68 --> 00:31:15.68 one thing led to another I wasn't there but shots were fired and my father was killed
00:31:18.80 --> 00:31:33.60 and I remember that day so vividly it was I don't mean to sound countless but in in a lot of ways
00:31:33.60 --> 00:31:41.36 it liberated me liberated it's generally liberated my mother it was one of the hardest
00:31:41.36 --> 00:31:51.52 emo sad days for her but it liberated her and it liberated myself and my brother and it taught me
00:31:51.52 --> 00:31:57.52 it became the benchmark for me to do so many more things in my life because I don't think I was
00:31:57.52 --> 00:32:05.60 meant to be a seal I don't think I was born to do any of the things that I've had the opportunity
00:32:05.60 --> 00:32:14.72 to do but is because of those experiences being able to stand up to a person to a figure who I
00:32:14.72 --> 00:32:21.76 feared more than anyone and to be able to do something that I never thought I could be possible
00:32:21.76 --> 00:32:26.40 doing standing up to someone especially someone who was threatening to kill you and the person
00:32:26.40 --> 00:32:35.28 you loved most it was empowering it it it taught it liberated me taught me I'm not the scared little
00:32:35.28 --> 00:32:44.72 boy I thought I was I can do these things that I can be a part of something bigger than myself
00:32:44.72 --> 00:32:57.76 and you know I remember having so much foolish knife prod at the time I was naturally
00:32:57.76 --> 00:33:03.76 even 18 and just so angry with the world just having so much hate to my heart I think a lot of
00:33:05.20 --> 00:33:12.64 I had a lot of hate my heart as a kid when I see my child Christian who is full of happiness
00:33:12.64 --> 00:33:18.96 and carefree and it's like me in so many ways I see him and I realize that is the person I would have
00:33:18.96 --> 00:33:26.80 become and I want to protect that but with the life the card side been given I just had a lot of
00:33:26.80 --> 00:33:35.20 hate my heart and I refused to cry because I thought that was a form of weakness to cry for my
00:33:35.20 --> 00:33:43.92 father would pass then I never you know didn't cry at his funeral or anything and I remember
00:33:43.92 --> 00:33:51.92 that day on that day when my father died we went to the police department and I already know
00:33:51.92 --> 00:33:59.60 what had happened and I remember going in and there were three cops to the side and you could I
00:33:59.60 --> 00:34:08.72 I knew then and I also know just now of how warriors talk and the guy talking was motioning with
00:34:08.72 --> 00:34:14.40 his hands and he was recounting the story that led to my father's death and you know using his
00:34:14.40 --> 00:34:22.08 motions of how he entered and he saw us come in and my brother and was weeping and very
00:34:22.88 --> 00:34:28.72 naturally inconceivable and I was there and I think we made brief eye contact and I think I think
00:34:28.72 --> 00:34:37.52 I think I had the clarity and the respect to kind of stop what he was doing and realized that he was
00:34:37.52 --> 00:34:42.48 probably recounting a war story of someone he had killed and in this family which is walking through
00:34:42.48 --> 00:34:47.36 I haven't thought about that a long time but it just telling the story made me remember that
00:34:47.36 --> 00:34:54.64 and the police the detective I taught to he said son I'm sorry to tell you but your father
00:34:54.64 --> 00:35:04.88 is dead and this is one I want in a room and I just emotionalist just stone faced and he said
00:35:04.88 --> 00:35:25.92 I take it that this is not bad news it this is good and I said it I'm just relieved sir and he said
00:35:27.20 --> 00:35:28.08 I understand so
00:35:28.08 --> 00:35:45.92 and it's just a day for so many reasons that that helped me be reborn into the person I
00:35:45.92 --> 00:35:51.20 wanted to become that I've always wanted to become my entire life and I knew from there that
00:35:51.20 --> 00:36:02.32 maybe just maybe I had what it took to be a seal is there anything that you can think of
00:36:03.76 --> 00:36:12.16 because like that that's obviously just a harrowing story but at some point you
00:36:13.52 --> 00:36:17.52 or maybe it was some point along the way or maybe it was multiple points along the way but
00:36:17.52 --> 00:36:23.28 it's like you turn instead of turning towards the darkness right instead of becoming a person
00:36:23.28 --> 00:36:28.72 that's abusive instead of hating like you said you had hatred in your heart which could have
00:36:29.44 --> 00:36:33.68 turned you and just a completely totally different direction in your life
00:36:35.04 --> 00:36:40.32 is there anything that you can think of that made you look up and say you know this is for me right now
00:36:40.32 --> 00:36:49.68 you know this is my first time hearing this stuff and you know when you when you
00:36:49.68 --> 00:36:55.60 you applied to becoming an officer and become a PA I think that's what you originally applying for
00:36:55.60 --> 00:37:00.72 were you becoming trying to become a PA for me it's always being a physician okay so you're applying
00:37:00.72 --> 00:37:06.000 for the medical thing and I remember I'm sitting on your medical board and or your officer board
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.04 and I'm with it's me as a seal and two like one regular officer and then like a doctor officer
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.84 and I remember I said something along the lines of because you know me I kind of say whatever I
00:37:19.84 --> 00:37:25.84 want but I said something along the lines of like hey I don't like hospitals I don't like doctors
00:37:25.84 --> 00:37:30.48 I don't like nurses I don't like any of that stuff I have no idea why you would ever want to do this
00:37:30.48 --> 00:37:35.52 I don't know why you want to go being a hospital all day and I said but if I had to have someone
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:44.48 taking care of my kids I would want it to be you because I knew you had this just um you that
00:37:44.48 --> 00:37:49.92 you were a very compassionate person that you really cared about other people I mean I saw that
00:37:49.92 --> 00:37:58.32 from day one with you and and now I'm I'll say now it's so obvious well part of it's obvious
00:37:58.32 --> 00:38:03.44 part of it's obvious that you can go with these experiences that you went through I mean we see it
00:38:03.44 --> 00:38:07.44 every day that people go in two directions with those you know when horrible things like that happen they
00:38:07.44 --> 00:38:16.08 can follow in those footsteps of of evil for lack of a better word or they can recognize that
00:38:16.08 --> 00:38:21.44 it's evil and they can go in the other direction which is what you did and I'm just wondering is
00:38:21.44 --> 00:38:26.72 there can you are there any pieces that you can put together that you can say to yourself well
00:38:26.72 --> 00:38:34.40 one of the things that you saw was this and this made you think you know what my the way my
00:38:34.40 --> 00:38:42.32 father acted was wrong and I'm not going to be that way it's a good question
00:38:45.28 --> 00:38:52.16 I don't think I have an answer for you I think that's a question that a lot of people would
00:38:52.16 --> 00:39:01.60 love answered especially with so much abuse and dysfunction in society in America all over the world
00:39:02.16 --> 00:39:09.84 we would love to know what it is that allows people to sublet me their bad experiences
00:39:10.64 --> 00:39:20.96 to channel it for a good cause and I'm not here to tell you I was never on the path to darkness
00:39:20.96 --> 00:39:31.60 I am by no means a saint or have always done good things I've done things that I'm not proud of
00:39:32.48 --> 00:39:44.32 I've sinned I sinned every day I try and keep that light there as a guiding path for good all the time
00:39:44.32 --> 00:39:53.36 and one of the reasons why I wanted to be a doctor was not because I was in love with medicine
00:39:53.36 --> 00:40:01.04 I mean I do like medicine but it's to serve to a cause greater than myself that leaves a
00:40:01.04 --> 00:40:06.80 positive mark in this world it's the same reason why I wanted to be an astronaut I think being a
00:40:06.80 --> 00:40:10.40 seal was maybe a little bit more selfish for the reason that we talked about because I wanted to
00:40:10.40 --> 00:40:18.96 be a part of I wanted to find my identity but I don't know I think my I think my mother had a large
00:40:18.96 --> 00:40:28.000 part into it she's one of the strongest women I know and seeing that strength and that selflessness
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:35.76 and that sacrifice she fact sacrificed her dreams she could have been someone she's a smart woman
00:40:35.76 --> 00:40:46.80 she's a beautiful woman she didn't have to be with my father but I after having two boys
00:40:48.32 --> 00:40:55.60 and loving her children so much that she would sacrifice her dreams her potential to protect us
00:40:55.60 --> 00:41:04.96 I think that had a significant effect on me so if there's anyone to credit it would be my mother
00:41:08.96 --> 00:41:14.72 I don't I don't know if I don't know if I have the answer though
00:41:15.52 --> 00:41:21.04 well certainly seeing an example and you know I've been talking about this lately
00:41:21.04 --> 00:41:27.84 when you sometimes it's not easy to see something if there's not a contrast against it but for you to
00:41:27.84 --> 00:41:36.40 see the contrast of someone that's bad you know your dad doing bad things abusing weaker people I
00:41:36.40 --> 00:41:41.84 mean this is just you know they're just that's just bad and you might not have noticed
00:41:42.80 --> 00:41:49.68 how bad that was if it weren't contrasted so drastically against your mom who is making
00:41:49.68 --> 00:41:56.56 the ultimate sacrifice with her life and standing up for you and taking that abuse and staying in that
00:41:56.56 --> 00:42:03.92 situation because she wanted to take care of you kids and I think when you see that sometimes it
00:42:03.92 --> 00:42:08.72 makes things just more obvious it's something that you may not have seen otherwise if your mom was
00:42:09.68 --> 00:42:13.68 you know if your mom was just as abusive or she had her own problems or she was doing things that
00:42:13.68 --> 00:42:18.72 were wrong you you may have just thought that's the way the world is and that's the way you're going
00:42:18.72 --> 00:42:25.76 yeah but to be able to see oh it doesn't have to be like this and there's there's good in people's
00:42:25.76 --> 00:42:35.44 hearts is that that could be for a kid the difference you know I mean
00:42:37.44 --> 00:42:46.72 all good points sand it's so weird to be saying to be recounting this story I've never said this story
00:42:46.72 --> 00:42:53.28 publicly and you said yourself you've never heard this story well if you ask most guys
00:42:53.28 --> 00:42:59.68 from Charlie Bitton they have not heard this actually I think if you ask all about one maybe
00:42:59.68 --> 00:43:05.44 one person they have not heard this story and it's just something I kept close to my chest because
00:43:08.88 --> 00:43:14.000 everyone has their story I don't think my story is anymore important in anyone else's
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:22.40 and we talked a little bit before this podcast but I'm a little at unease and still I am
00:43:22.40 --> 00:43:28.32 about being on a podcast like this because it's so I don't see I don't want to say it's contrary
00:43:28.32 --> 00:43:36.32 to my beliefs but it just requires being extra thoughtful and I think that create we all
00:43:36.32 --> 00:43:47.76 swore to to not advertise and promote the nature of our work and never seek recognition for
00:43:47.76 --> 00:43:58.08 that night take that creed too hard so it's weird for me to be recounting this story
00:43:58.08 --> 00:44:04.48 publicly and if it was up to me I'd keep it close to the chest for all my days but as I've grown
00:44:04.48 --> 00:44:12.88 older I've come to realize that there is value for other people I'm not the only person in this
00:44:12.88 --> 00:44:19.36 situation and frankly there are people in way we're situations than I am than I was in who are
00:44:19.36 --> 00:44:30.48 still in it for them to know that you can be born with bad cards you mean you don't need to have it all
00:44:30.48 --> 00:44:40.32 but you have a choice and the power to craft your own destiny your own path and for that reason I think
00:44:40.32 --> 00:44:49.76 it's a I think it is less important that I keep stuff like this close to my chest and then that's why
00:44:49.76 --> 00:44:57.68 I'm sharing it with you well that's that's one of the very reasons why this podcast even exists
00:44:57.68 --> 00:45:03.76 is for people to learn one of the people go through that they're not alone that things could be
00:45:03.76 --> 00:45:10.000 worse for them they could get better I mean that's so exactly what you said is the exact reason why
00:45:10.88 --> 00:45:17.20 sharing that story is is absolutely important because people can people can learn from it people can
00:45:17.20 --> 00:45:22.24 people can get over their own things that they're facing because they know that someone else did it
00:45:22.24 --> 00:45:26.08 I mean how powerful is it you know you hear the story all the time about the first guy it will
00:45:26.08 --> 00:45:31.28 banister broke the four mile time or the the four minute mile no one thought it was possible once he
00:45:31.28 --> 00:45:36.24 did it all kinds of people did it so just knowing that someone like you can go from this horrible
00:45:36.24 --> 00:45:45.92 place and do what you've done yeah that's a that's huge did these events as they unfolded
00:45:45.92 --> 00:45:50.80 impact your decision to join the Navy and at what point did you go down to the recruiter and
00:45:50.80 --> 00:45:57.52 sign up so I was so when my father died it was a few months before graduating high school and
00:45:57.52 --> 00:46:02.32 I was already depved in I had a shift date so I had already gone and signed the paperwork and I
00:46:02.32 --> 00:46:07.84 mean not the not the final dot in line that makes you in the Navy you know you raise your right
00:46:07.84 --> 00:46:13.60 hand and do the enlisted oath but my mind was set I mean my mind was set a week after
00:46:14.16 --> 00:46:19.52 Keith Blum told me what a Navy seal was back when I was 16 I mean they was clear like
00:46:19.52 --> 00:46:26.24 I'm going to do this and no one is going to be able to convince me otherwise and I talked to
00:46:26.24 --> 00:46:31.60 people and people asked me to like I think I want to be a seal and I don't know if this is a
00:46:31.60 --> 00:46:36.80 litmus test but I always try and convince people to not do it and I feel like if I can convince
00:46:36.80 --> 00:46:41.20 someone to not do it I just perhaps have saved them in the money a lot of time and money
00:46:41.76 --> 00:46:46.32 because if I can convince you to not be a seal then you probably will convince yourself
00:46:46.32 --> 00:46:54.96 at the first sign of suffering so but I was not convincedable you could not convince me to do anything
00:46:55.68 --> 00:47:01.36 and the conversation this is crazy you're I'm pulling up memories I have not thought of in years
00:47:02.40 --> 00:47:08.24 just the conversations I had crafted that I was planning to tell my father because I could not tell
00:47:08.24 --> 00:47:18.000 my father I was born in the Navy no way he would have you know you may have quite literally killed me
00:47:19.68 --> 00:47:24.80 I think that would have been very upsetting to him because he had a clear path for me and it was to be
00:47:26.80 --> 00:47:31.36 it was to be a doctor at Harvard Medical School and I promised you that is not why I went to
00:47:31.36 --> 00:47:37.92 Harvard Medical School but it was to do that and for me I was like there's no way I'm going to do that
00:47:37.92 --> 00:47:42.88 I'm not going to live your dream I don't want to be a doctor I don't want to go to an Ivy League school
00:47:43.60 --> 00:47:50.88 I want to be in the trenches I want to enlist I want to be the E1 working my way up learning from
00:47:50.88 --> 00:47:56.56 everyone else learning the ropes and roughing it being in the trenches with boys that's all I
00:47:56.56 --> 00:48:04.24 wanted to do and I crafted how I would tell my father I was actually going to join the academy and I was
00:48:04.24 --> 00:48:10.64 thinking I had this plan to go the exchange and like buying officers uniform so when I would come home
00:48:10.64 --> 00:48:16.96 I would like show up in an officer's uniform just to like maintain this perception to my father that
00:48:16.96 --> 00:48:23.04 I was in the academy and these are like the ropes the extent that I had planned because I was so
00:48:23.04 --> 00:48:29.20 afraid to tell my father and fortunately I didn't have to do any of that because my father died
00:48:30.32 --> 00:48:38.72 it sounds callous but it fortunately I did not have to go through that deceit because my father passed away and
00:48:40.32 --> 00:48:48.88 I don't mean to paint my father in a bad light really I love my father I do I could not have said that
00:48:48.88 --> 00:48:57.68 I was unable to say those words for a very long time would I do love my father and I understand he was
00:48:57.68 --> 00:49:08.48 human and fell to sin and his demons he just didn't have the clarity and the tools to deal with that
00:49:08.48 --> 00:49:15.76 and I forgive him for that so I don't mean to paint my father in a bad light and as I said before
00:49:15.76 --> 00:49:21.68 I would not trade those experiences for anything because they were formative and everything I am today
00:49:21.68 --> 00:49:30.88 started with those with that darkness when you were talking about going into
00:49:33.36 --> 00:49:39.28 whatever going into the recruiter and all that and I'm imagining what when I did it when I
00:49:39.28 --> 00:49:45.44 remember being because you were talking about feeling liberated before when your dad died
00:49:47.12 --> 00:49:56.16 I know that when I joined the navy man I felt like so awesome like I felt like I didn't need anybody else
00:49:56.16 --> 00:50:01.52 I was 100 like you had no one had any control over me anymore I just kind of at that moment when I
00:50:01.52 --> 00:50:06.16 signed that dotted line I now was in control of my fate even though most people would look at the
00:50:06.16 --> 00:50:11.60 opposite oh you're in the navy now and you're gonna have to follow orders and where uniforms and all
00:50:11.60 --> 00:50:21.52 this stuff to me it was complete and utter freedom that's what it felt like now you're so you
00:50:21.52 --> 00:50:26.40 graduate high school so did you graduate your 18 years old or your 17 years old I was 18 when I
00:50:26.40 --> 00:50:38.72 graduated high school and you go to navy boot camp yep how was that I'm still in the navy
00:50:39.76 --> 00:50:47.44 I'm an active duty lieutenant so I will maintain my level of respect and difference to the ways of the
00:50:47.44 --> 00:50:59.68 navy but navy boot camp is just wasn't as trying as I thought it would I think when you have the idea
00:50:59.68 --> 00:51:03.28 that you're gonna be a seal you prepare yourself for a different standard so when you go to boot
00:51:03.28 --> 00:51:08.32 camp you show up in slow it's just a little different yeah well the focus is on like attention to detail
00:51:10.32 --> 00:51:16.16 it's more of a pain I don't know more more more of a pain like you're like oh this is a pain
00:51:16.16 --> 00:51:19.60 because you're after make your bed and you have to fold your underwear a certain way you have to do all these
00:51:19.60 --> 00:51:26.08 things that more than their physical pain they're just a pain just a pain there's a rhyme and
00:51:26.08 --> 00:51:31.04 reason for what I do things and I think it was sure um you know when I I smile I chuckle in
00:51:31.04 --> 00:51:36.000 my smile when I think about navy boot camp because that's where it all started I mean I loved it
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:43.52 I like you said you felt free I felt free I felt I had no one like you know when my dad died
00:51:43.52 --> 00:51:50.80 I just felt this weight on my shoulders just released like I had never felt before and for the first
00:51:50.80 --> 00:51:57.92 time I didn't have to worry about my brother or my mother so and I just wanted to get away
00:52:00.08 --> 00:52:07.28 I the teams the military it was it might take it to escape the childhood I was born into this
00:52:07.28 --> 00:52:14.64 idea of Jonathan that people had knew as a scared little boy I needed a reset button and the
00:52:14.64 --> 00:52:21.04 military was my reset button I'm gonna start a new with people I don't know who have no idea where
00:52:21.04 --> 00:52:27.76 I came from of my background and I am going to go through the ranks on my own merit and hard work
00:52:28.48 --> 00:52:37.20 and learn how to be led and lead others and it was the best decision
00:52:37.20 --> 00:52:48.80 I have ever made and um every time I say that I think of my wife because I think marrying my wife
00:52:48.80 --> 00:52:53.28 was the best decision I made but it's it's a little different you understand what I mean but
00:52:53.28 --> 00:52:59.44 it was the best decision for me in my growth and development to join the military and it's not
00:52:59.44 --> 00:53:03.60 like the private I'm not trying to sound like a recruiter join the military it's not for everyone
00:53:03.60 --> 00:53:08.80 but it was for me I would tell you that and well this is true for my wife for sure if I wasn't
00:53:08.80 --> 00:53:14.48 if I didn't join the Navy if I didn't go in the teams my wife a probably wouldn't have married me
00:53:14.48 --> 00:53:23.44 because I wouldn't have been the human that I am and to this day if like the reason that
00:53:23.44 --> 00:53:28.88 where happily married is rooted in the fact that I was in the days whether she likes to
00:53:28.88 --> 00:53:35.28 or not she knows it's true like you're you have that always and it's always a part of you
00:53:36.24 --> 00:53:42.88 so um it sounded like you were pretty well prepared for buds in terms of you played water
00:53:42.88 --> 00:53:46.32 polo you were a good swimmer you were working out on the beach in Santa Monica
00:53:47.52 --> 00:53:50.32 it sounds like physically you were you were pretty good to go
00:53:51.12 --> 00:53:57.36 I would say in most aspects I think I over I put an over alliance on
00:53:57.36 --> 00:54:02.88 calisthenics and body you just body weight exercises I mean I could crush the piece whatever
00:54:02.88 --> 00:54:09.04 they call you now the PST you know the time run and swim and pull ups and all that stuff I could crush
00:54:09.04 --> 00:54:15.28 that but you put weight on me you put a log on me you put a boat on me how much did you want
00:54:15.28 --> 00:54:23.60 to go on a boat I was a 140 45 pounds I'm 180 105 now I'm a lot stronger now than it was back then
00:54:23.60 --> 00:54:29.68 but I'm also a lot slower like I probably can run this fast it's back then but I didn't understand
00:54:30.48 --> 00:54:37.44 strength the way I do now I didn't incorporate barbells into my routine it was all body weight
00:54:37.44 --> 00:54:43.60 stuff so it was definitely an over alliance on the body weight exercises calisthenics running swimming
00:54:44.72 --> 00:54:50.48 and if I could redo it I would have eaten a lot more calories during buds or before but
00:54:50.48 --> 00:54:56.40 four buds just to be bigger and stronger and I would have swatted in warmer and yeah I would have
00:54:56.40 --> 00:55:03.20 squatted a lot and just just to say I mean I was shoulder presses bench press squatting dead
00:55:03.20 --> 00:55:11.36 less I would I didn't know that before preparing for buds and so I feel I was preparing but I
00:55:11.36 --> 00:55:17.20 wasn't prepared in that respect then was there anything that gave you like a real problems in
00:55:17.20 --> 00:55:21.44 buds like did you did you make it through one class did you get rolled back at all now I was
00:55:21.44 --> 00:55:27.28 lucky enough to make it through with two four seven and one shot you started with two four seven
00:55:27.28 --> 00:55:35.04 and then you graduated with two four seven did you fail anything no because you were comfortable
00:55:35.04 --> 00:55:40.32 in the water from water polo so you were real for different dive phase yeah I thought dive
00:55:40.32 --> 00:55:46.64 dive phase was was great um I was very comfortable being thrown around the water because you're
00:55:46.64 --> 00:55:50.88 right I mean just from playing water polo you used to being like people were trying to drown
00:55:50.88 --> 00:55:55.60 you in the ball so being thrashed around in pool comp wasn't a big deal I mean
00:55:56.64 --> 00:56:03.68 everyone's keep the water you were your own greatest enemy in the water right if you just
00:56:03.68 --> 00:56:10.64 maintain clarity and focus and calm your nerves everything will be okay it's when you thrash
00:56:10.64 --> 00:56:16.96 you panic you get air hungry that plays on you and that's when you really people have a
00:56:16.96 --> 00:56:20.56 hard time I think when it comes to water related activities well yeah that's that's why
00:56:20.56 --> 00:56:24.48 I immediately went to and you said all you made it through everything I immediately was like oh yeah
00:56:24.48 --> 00:56:29.76 you played water polo because what what is it that church people like okay you're gonna be tired
00:56:29.76 --> 00:56:34.000 that can trip some people up you're gonna be called they don't want to be called anymore so they
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.84 quit like those two things hey running and swimming pretty much are sorry running pretty much
00:56:39.84 --> 00:56:44.08 like you're gonna get put on the grind there and you're gonna your your times are gonna drop
00:56:44.08 --> 00:56:49.52 and you're gonna be there's not to me people like it dropped for running it happens for sure
00:56:49.52 --> 00:56:54.72 it's not to me people like I drop for obstacle course water though that's that's the
00:56:54.72 --> 00:56:59.20 separator right so if you're comfortable in the water going to buds man you have a huge
00:56:59.20 --> 00:57:02.64 leg up because all those little things you just rattled off as if it's no big deal like
00:57:02.64 --> 00:57:06.80 don't panic don't get air hungry like that's real easy when you're a water polo play but for
00:57:06.80 --> 00:57:12.64 these dudes from Iowa that didn't grow up in the water you know unless they grew up on a lake
00:57:12.64 --> 00:57:16.40 somewhere well I mean there were some guys in my class there was one guy I'm particularly
00:57:16.40 --> 00:57:22.48 that was from Iowa and he was a wrestler and he was strong and he was fast and he was an incredible
00:57:22.48 --> 00:57:26.64 shape and the dude sank and he just panicked in the water was in climate equipment yeah you know so
00:57:27.68 --> 00:57:33.36 I think that's a big a big separator but I have so much respect for the folks who didn't have
00:57:33.36 --> 00:57:38.88 that kind of background of being so comfortable with the water I don't want to say his name because
00:57:38.88 --> 00:57:46.88 he's still active and he's over at damn neck but let's say it's just his first name my buddy Tyler
00:57:46.88 --> 00:57:53.20 who I went through he was like my sister division in boot camp and I have so much respect for
00:57:53.20 --> 00:57:59.12 Tyler for just the way he carries himself and how he's just a very hard man but he showed up
00:57:59.12 --> 00:58:04.24 to boot camp and didn't know how to do the sidestroke that's insane and he learned in the
00:58:04.24 --> 00:58:10.24 locker room before the PST and this guy is like one most squared away and prepared guys ever
00:58:10.24 --> 00:58:15.84 and to this day I gave him like I'm like how did you show up and not know how to do the sidestroke
00:58:16.88 --> 00:58:23.04 but just from sheer willpower he made it through and and like performed very what we were
00:58:23.04 --> 00:58:30.72 swim buddies dive buddies so he performed very very well so I was I just chuckle and so I have a
00:58:30.72 --> 00:58:37.60 lot of respect for people who are not comfortable but through sheer willpower will get knocked out you
00:58:37.60 --> 00:58:42.56 know that 50 meters swim if you've played waterholder swim that's not a big deal to do 50
00:58:42.56 --> 00:58:50.32 meter underwater swim it gets uncomfortable sure but there are folks who go to they go to the light right
00:58:50.32 --> 00:58:58.56 they they go unconscious and I have so much respect for that level determination like I would rather die
00:58:59.28 --> 00:59:07.12 they can give up and you know and I don't know I had to get props to that was there anything that
00:59:07.12 --> 00:59:10.24 was there any moments in buddha where you were like man I don't know if this is from here
00:59:10.24 --> 00:59:15.04 did that not even cross your mind so I want to I want to be clear I was not a stellar performer
00:59:15.04 --> 00:59:22.72 but I was middle of the pack runner swimmer everything with the long stibotes you know there's a
00:59:22.72 --> 00:59:27.76 standard to hell wiggies it's not just don't quit you need to perform to a standard and for me
00:59:28.72 --> 00:59:35.84 I just wanted to make it clear I was giving my heart and everything I did so that my
00:59:36.80 --> 00:59:44.72 I cared more about what my boat crew thought then then my instructors there was one
00:59:44.72 --> 00:59:52.48 instructor who I still remember instructor Megan I think just had it out for me but you know
00:59:52.48 --> 01:00:00.08 just just a skinny kid from from Los Angeles and I cared so I just wanted to put all I was like
01:00:00.08 --> 01:00:07.84 if I just put out put out my boat crew looks at me and and I remember I got my boat crew Nick
01:00:07.84 --> 01:00:14.88 Jack who who passed away during hostage rescue who gave the ultimate sacrifice
01:00:16.80 --> 01:00:24.32 him and my buddy Steve another guy there gave me that reassuring like hey you belong here and that's
01:00:24.32 --> 01:00:30.000 that meant so much to me so a lot of times I don't understand when a person who is in buddha
01:00:30.56 --> 01:00:36.16 and is not a performer and everyone else wants him to quit how they could like be there because
01:00:36.16 --> 01:00:42.56 I care so much about what my brothers think that if they didn't want me there I would never be there
01:00:42.56 --> 01:00:50.40 I would never want to slow anyone else down I don't know to answer your question
01:00:51.28 --> 01:00:56.56 you know there were certainly hard times I don't think there was ever a time where I wanted like
01:00:56.56 --> 01:01:01.76 I'm gonna quit but there was definitely times where I wanted the pain to stop and one
01:01:01.76 --> 01:01:06.40 particular time I remember it was you know that two hour nap you get in buds or in hell
01:01:06.40 --> 01:01:08.08 week yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:01:09.28 --> 01:01:13.92 the warm sleeping bag on a cot and they wake you up I don't know if they still do this but they
01:01:13.92 --> 01:01:19.68 wake you up and they just whisper like get up and hit the surf and like the nicest most
01:01:19.68 --> 01:01:29.04 compassionate voice and it disarms you right because it they have circumvented that fight or flight
01:01:29.04 --> 01:01:33.44 response right you don't have you you don't mount that defense you just immediately get
01:01:33.44 --> 01:01:39.28 woken up very nicely and get sent to the cold water and that was the closest where I was like
01:01:40.08 --> 01:01:47.68 I want this to stop I want this pain and suffering to stop but as far as like being like I want
01:01:47.68 --> 01:01:53.92 to quit or I'm going to quit that wasn't there for me yeah that's totally understand why
01:01:53.92 --> 01:01:57.76 you always hear that thing that everyone thinks about quitting and I'm like I didn't think about
01:01:57.76 --> 01:02:02.48 quitting I know I was like whatever bring it yeah I think there's a difference between wanting
01:02:02.48 --> 01:02:08.32 to thinking about quitting and thinking about just wanting it to stop yeah well definitely sucks yeah
01:02:09.36 --> 01:02:14.24 but you know what I was like you said you felt free when I showed some buds and I got wet and
01:02:14.24 --> 01:02:18.96 sandy I got my buddy Jordan Lewis I got a picture of when we first got wet and sandy in white shirts
01:02:18.96 --> 01:02:23.36 and we're just beaming with smiles or the selfie just like I was so happy to be there
01:02:23.36 --> 01:02:30.64 I'm so happy to be starting my journey of embracing that suffering and sucked what years it
01:02:30.64 --> 01:02:35.60 right now when you what year did you go to buds so to four seven started in early two thousand
01:02:36.32 --> 01:02:44.96 spring in 2003 spring summer 2003 so we were in hellwaken fall 2003 and then we you know
01:02:44.96 --> 01:02:49.44 graduate buds in 2004 early so you know you're going to war or at least hope and you are
01:02:49.44 --> 01:03:00.08 yeah I mean absolutely when you know people ask me to join cousin 911 and I mean frankly I
01:03:00.08 --> 01:03:05.28 already told you that's but I joined for very I think more selfish reasons but 911
01:03:05.28 --> 01:03:14.24 only galvanized me to want to join even more if anything it just just how naive I was I was a little
01:03:14.24 --> 01:03:19.76 bummed out this is my 18 year old self saying oh the war's gonna be done by the time I get there
01:03:20.56 --> 01:03:29.04 I missed it I'm 18 years old this is 2002 and I could not have been any more wrong
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:40.08 but of course when at that time especially in my development I I wanted war I think
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:45.68 I think it's hard articulate why I'm gonna but a lot of people feel this way who trained to do
01:03:45.68 --> 01:03:53.20 something they want that and I don't know how I'm sure we can talk at lengths about how we each
01:03:53.20 --> 01:03:57.84 now feel about the experiences we've gone through and I wouldn't trade for anything but war is
01:03:58.56 --> 01:04:05.36 I don't know about you but it was pretty ugly yeah for sure you know I had I was on a
01:04:05.36 --> 01:04:11.92 guy named Sam Harris's podcast and he called me out because you know I I talk about how like
01:04:11.92 --> 01:04:17.68 leading men in combat is the best thing in my life and and then I also say war is absolute you know
01:04:17.68 --> 01:04:22.000 the most horrible thing in the world and he goes how do you how do you reconcile those two things
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.72 and the way I explained to him I said if you ever met somebody that has cancer that survives
01:04:26.72 --> 01:04:33.84 and when they get through they say they say you know I'm glad it happened to me because they learned
01:04:33.84 --> 01:04:38.40 so much they don't would never wish it on anybody well that's that's pretty much exactly how
01:04:38.40 --> 01:04:44.64 I feel about war I've never heard that analogy but I think it's on point I would never trade it
01:04:44.64 --> 01:04:50.000 for anything and I would go back in the trenches right now in a split second with my brothers
01:04:51.12 --> 01:04:57.44 I would go back in that environment right now but I would never wish it on my own children and I hope
01:04:57.44 --> 01:05:08.24 they never see it you get done with buds and then you you when did you know you're gonna be
01:05:08.24 --> 01:05:16.16 going to age you go to 18 delta I did yeah so when I talk about accidents like that was another accident
01:05:17.76 --> 01:05:21.12 so you know their critters are they have a difference between accidents and luck
01:05:21.12 --> 01:05:27.28 could you keep calling things accidents some of it sounds like it might be a little bit more
01:05:27.28 --> 01:05:34.08 luck some of it's luck that you made accidents I don't know I think I think what I'm trying to
01:05:34.08 --> 01:05:41.84 point out is that there wasn't a plan God not a plan at all I mean plan for me was just
01:05:42.56 --> 01:05:48.72 I like to told you all I wanted to be was a seal I had no idea no aspirations to be a
01:05:48.72 --> 01:05:53.92 physician to be an astronaut I just want one goal at a time that's really important to me
01:05:53.92 --> 01:05:59.84 even to this day that you have one singular goal because you should be all in and what you're doing
01:06:01.04 --> 01:06:07.52 you should be genuine in what you're doing not have some social climbing some some professional
01:06:07.52 --> 01:06:13.68 ladder that you're trying to meet these goals and be stepping stones and why I said accidents
01:06:13.68 --> 01:06:19.84 because I didn't want to be a corpsman in fact I wanted to be an intelligent specialist because
01:06:19.84 --> 01:06:27.52 the sounded cool or an operation I had no idea what an IS or an OS which is the rating for those
01:06:27.52 --> 01:06:33.84 to job didn't I just sounded cool but I would have shipped out later and I'm like I want to
01:06:33.84 --> 01:06:38.88 ship out as soon as I want to go away as soon as possible what's the rate that will get me there
01:06:38.88 --> 01:06:43.44 the fastest it's it's done you got to be a corpsman what's a corpsman well you do this stuff you
01:06:43.44 --> 01:06:49.12 did you you're a hospital stuff I don't want to do that don't like I want to be on the mission like
01:06:49.12 --> 01:06:54.72 if I like in the unlikely event I made it through I don't want to be the medic that doesn't
01:06:54.72 --> 01:07:01.68 get to do any cool stuff come to find out that's completely not true at all so that's why I say
01:07:01.68 --> 01:07:09.20 it's an accident plan it that way and after SKT seal qualification training I got sent to
01:07:09.20 --> 01:07:15.12 for brag to learn how to be a combat medic and then how long is that scroll that was six months
01:07:16.40 --> 01:07:19.84 and he never told you that this is where someone lied to you because whoever told you the
01:07:19.84 --> 01:07:26.64 fastest way to get to the teams is to be a corpsman was just wrong well I think for me I was okay
01:07:26.64 --> 01:07:32.40 with that because I had already I just wanted to get the but and you know fast as fast as fast
01:07:32.40 --> 01:07:37.36 way the buts was go corpsman the fast way to join the navy just to get like because I'm like
01:07:38.16 --> 01:07:42.96 it means talking on recruiters so I want to get out of here as soon as possible what do I need to do
01:07:43.20 --> 01:07:48.48 you need to be a corpsman okay I'll be a corpsman whatever figure it out later when you got to
01:07:48.48 --> 01:07:54.08 when you started doing 18 delta the the school the medic school did you start did you find it
01:07:54.08 --> 01:07:59.20 interesting were you kind of like wow this is cool absolutely I'm fascinated by anything that's
01:07:59.20 --> 01:08:06.16 challenging if it's engineering space medicine anything that challenges you it's fascinating like
01:08:06.16 --> 01:08:11.68 so I thought it was completely fascinating I loved I came to learn that medicine is pretty cool like
01:08:11.68 --> 01:08:18.24 and I took it seriously like though I didn't want to be the medic I understand the gravity of
01:08:18.24 --> 01:08:23.52 that that kind of honor that you are interested with the lives of your teammates that's a huge
01:08:23.52 --> 01:08:28.16 honor and I take it seriously so once the decision was made that I'm going to do that I was all in
01:08:28.16 --> 01:08:33.36 like I'm going to be the best medic I can be and being an 18 delta honestly those six months
01:08:33.36 --> 01:08:38.72 were more difficult than any time I had an uncle school because it's so much material crammed
01:08:38.72 --> 01:08:43.92 into six months on how to be a trauma combat medic and you learn a lot of skills I mean you learn
01:08:43.92 --> 01:08:51.84 how to do chest tubes which is a procedure that physicians train years through medical school
01:08:51.84 --> 01:08:58.32 and residency to learn how to do and you learn how to do that in six months crazy procedures life
01:08:58.32 --> 01:09:07.12 saving procedures and I had to give props and respect to the army because I think that they train
01:09:07.12 --> 01:09:14.88 the best medics really and I think that their culture surrounding combat medics is on point to maintain
01:09:14.88 --> 01:09:21.44 that currency so I had a great time at Fort Brakes on the best places to be stuck in but I had a
01:09:21.44 --> 01:09:28.40 great time learning from our army brothers and sisters yeah the the way that we train our medics
01:09:28.40 --> 01:09:33.76 and the the feats that they're able to perform on the battlefield are awesome keeping guys alive
01:09:33.76 --> 01:09:42.16 it's it's it's amazing did so you get done with that and for some reason
01:09:43.20 --> 01:09:46.96 you show up at sealed team three and what was sealed team three on deployment when you showed
01:09:46.96 --> 01:09:50.64 up or what was going on yeah somehow you ended up going to sniper school right I know
01:09:50.64 --> 01:09:55.36 which is totally ridiculous it is so for anybody that doesn't know if you're a new guy in the
01:09:55.36 --> 01:10:01.12 sealed teams you don't get to go to sniper school normally a guy's going one puttune maybe even
01:10:01.12 --> 01:10:07.92 two puttunes maybe even three puttunes before a guy gets the the honor of going to one of the most
01:10:07.92 --> 01:10:14.56 coveted schools in the sealed teams which is the sniper school it's a hard school but it's a
01:10:14.56 --> 01:10:21.60 call that everybody wants everyone wants to go to that school and somehow accidentally luckily
01:10:21.60 --> 01:10:26.16 whatever you want to call it you show up to team three and you go right to sniper school as a
01:10:26.16 --> 01:10:30.08 medic which is another school that everybody wants because it's a great quarks also and you can
01:10:30.08 --> 01:10:37.20 you've got an actual an actual marketable skill as a human being besides like hey I can walk
01:10:37.20 --> 01:10:42.000 point and shoot a machine gun that doesn't go get you anywhere but hey I can save people's lives
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.04 that's a huge skill and you're getting two of the best skills that the that the seal team has to
01:10:47.04 --> 01:10:55.36 offer as a new guy undeservedly absolutely you know I change and I also change my viewpoint of
01:10:55.36 --> 01:11:01.92 medics because I didn't realize I was going through SKT tie woods I'm sure you know passed away
01:11:03.84 --> 01:11:08.80 he was one of my instructors in SKT and he's a medic he was a corpsman too and he was like dude don't
01:11:08.80 --> 01:11:13.52 you know that the medic always has to go on the mission it always gets to go always goes like
01:11:13.52 --> 01:11:18.72 what are you talking about what you don't want to be the medic so that changed my perspective on
01:11:18.72 --> 01:11:24.40 medicine in the teams because I just wanted to be a shooter like you know and no disrespect
01:11:25.68 --> 01:11:29.28 to the officers of the seal teams but I want to be the one pulling the trigger I wanted to
01:11:29.28 --> 01:11:33.68 want it to be in the deepest of the trenches I know you understand where I'm coming from because
01:11:33.68 --> 01:11:41.76 you were enlisted before you became an officer and I have no idea how I got snipers go I showed up
01:11:41.76 --> 01:11:45.60 team three was selling deployment and they're like new guy go to sniper school
01:11:45.60 --> 01:11:55.52 Roger that I will and for me you know I I I had you know I had an awareness of where I
01:11:55.52 --> 01:12:00.96 stood on the tone of play I knew his new guy I knew I was smaller statue and I just wanted to
01:12:00.96 --> 01:12:07.04 prove myself I was just so hungry to do a good job and so I knew sniper school is going to be
01:12:07.04 --> 01:12:12.64 hard but like man I'm not going I'll do everything to not fail this and bring this asset to
01:12:12.64 --> 01:12:18.88 the pitoon and I'm so thankful of whoever it was that allowed me to go to sniper school as
01:12:18.88 --> 01:12:25.52 the new guy before team three showed up from deployment how'd you do in sniper school I so it's like
01:12:25.52 --> 01:12:29.44 three I don't know how it is now it's three phases you know the first phase is like pay because
01:12:29.44 --> 01:12:34.64 like photographic image capture where you basically learn how to use a nestle lock camera to take
01:12:34.64 --> 01:12:40.000 facial recognition pictures basically for you know SR or special reconnaissance and that's all
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000 geek stuff like using computers setting up a network, sending you know sending pictures through
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.60 radio waves I love that stuff and and that was came naturally to me the second part was scouting
01:12:51.60 --> 01:13:00.72 and scouting you also have to pass the you have to get a certain score on the rifle on the
01:13:00.72 --> 01:13:07.28 stocking the stocking and the rifle of course like you know 200 yard marine core test
01:13:07.28 --> 01:13:12.24 data penultin we would have to do which is a pretty hard test it's all iron sights and I
01:13:12.24 --> 01:13:16.24 never shot a gun I was gonna say that's why I was asking you this question because you know
01:13:16.24 --> 01:13:21.28 like I already said most people going to sniper school have at least one deployment if not two or three
01:13:21.28 --> 01:13:26.72 and you know you shoot thousands and thousands around every workup and deployment so you're improving
01:13:26.72 --> 01:13:31.04 your skills but you were coming right out of buds going to that with very you know with no experience
01:13:31.04 --> 01:13:34.96 yeah I mean you shoot very minimum you're like you don't know you don't learn how to be a sealant
01:13:34.96 --> 01:13:39.92 bud you just learn how to suffer and then you go to SKT and you get a little taste of what's
01:13:39.92 --> 01:13:43.44 like to learn some tactics but you don't really know anything still and you get to shoot a little
01:13:43.44 --> 01:13:47.68 bit but it's it's not that much so I didn't have that much and like I didn't grow up in a
01:13:47.68 --> 01:13:53.52 rural area where I had access to guns and so I didn't shoot I had very little shooting experience
01:13:53.52 --> 01:14:00.16 showing up to sniper school so that was hard and actually if I remember this correctly there was a
01:14:00.16 --> 01:14:05.84 point where I almost did not make it through because you had to get a certain score on the rifle
01:14:07.44 --> 01:14:12.80 but something clicked I mean if you just stick with the point to perform it's front sight focus
01:14:12.80 --> 01:14:23.12 body positioning fall through breathing they work yeah right and you just you you just I don't know
01:14:23.12 --> 01:14:30.000 if it's rounds or just perspective but eventually things clicked for me and I started to do
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.88 actually pretty well in the shooting part and the stalking was also something I struggled with but once
01:14:36.88 --> 01:14:44.56 I learned the person the I just had to geek it out just kind of dissect what stalking is and
01:14:44.56 --> 01:14:51.12 all stalking is it's really too phase of it right you have dead space right so if what dead space is
01:14:51.12 --> 01:14:58.32 is if you know if you have a known observer you put a piece of earth between you and the observer
01:14:58.88 --> 01:15:06.24 line of sight that person cannot see you you could have a parade in that lane of dead space
01:15:06.24 --> 01:15:11.76 and you could just walk your merry way because stalking was a time revolution but it was also
01:15:12.32 --> 01:15:17.36 you had to get a certain qualification by certain amount of time if you had all day then it'd be a lot easier
01:15:18.16 --> 01:15:22.72 and obviously if you don't have dead space then you have to just have to learn the human
01:15:22.72 --> 01:15:26.88 physiology all it's like the human eye is attracted to movement especially a night
01:15:27.84 --> 01:15:33.20 so if you understand that and just slow your role be cautious be thoughtful at every step you take
01:15:33.20 --> 01:15:40.56 every movement be slow methodical with your stalking to get to that shooting position to take that
01:15:40.56 --> 01:15:49.28 shot the things become a lot easier and took me so that phase was was hard and I think I
01:15:49.28 --> 01:15:53.44 actually may have almost failed out if I remember correctly but I was able to get through
01:15:53.44 --> 01:16:01.12 and the last portion was the actual shooting portion and that came much better for me I think
01:16:01.12 --> 01:16:08.48 I learned those points performance and sticking with that and I loved the math behind
01:16:09.04 --> 01:16:15.12 shooting at long range and people think like how hard is you just put a redical on what you're trying
01:16:15.12 --> 01:16:21.92 to shoot and like that's not what the sniper is you very rarely are shooting by putting your
01:16:21.92 --> 01:16:30.16 redical on a target like yeah sure if you have the time to dial and click into your windage in your
01:16:30.16 --> 01:16:35.20 dope which is another word for elevation sure you put your redical on that and that's perfect
01:16:36.72 --> 01:16:44.96 great but in the real world there's changing winds there's moving targets and there are targets
01:16:44.96 --> 01:16:51.20 of opportunity that are not sighted into your two or 300 yards that your scope is at it might be a
01:16:51.20 --> 01:16:55.20 target that's 600 yards and you're doped in at 300 or target that's 100 yards and you're
01:16:55.20 --> 01:17:00.64 doped in at 300 so you have to learn these math problems like well if there's a left to right wind
01:17:01.84 --> 01:17:08.40 I know that and I have to aim to the person you know to the right side of the person's body
01:17:08.40 --> 01:17:13.84 or maybe it's an extreme wind so I'm gonna be more conservative even even further to left
01:17:14.40 --> 01:17:19.28 or the person is further than I'm doped in so I'm gonna make sure I'm aiming one or two
01:17:19.28 --> 01:17:25.36 body links higher than the person right it's a math problem and it's it's an art so I loved
01:17:26.24 --> 01:17:35.68 the geeky side of that so I mean I was all about it and I was I was so happy and so I felt so
01:17:35.68 --> 01:17:42.08 privileged to have to gain that skill set to bring back to my普通 so now you get done with that
01:17:42.08 --> 01:17:47.52 and that school actually overlap with the beginning of tasking a bruiser and a work up so
01:17:47.52 --> 01:17:55.44 you showed up late as a new guy to our desert training facility out in the Imperial Valley Desert
01:17:56.32 --> 01:18:01.12 and I actually remember when you showed up very very clearly and there's a backstory that I'm
01:18:01.12 --> 01:18:07.52 not sure you know about this so we're out there at the desert training facility and
01:18:09.04 --> 01:18:16.56 you know some of the more senior guys had hazed the shit out of some of the guys
01:18:16.56 --> 01:18:23.92 and I saw what's going on and they were doing they did some stuff that was like dumb and so I
01:18:23.92 --> 01:18:28.96 grabbed the chiefs and I was like hey guys I got a talk to you so it was the it was the two
01:18:28.96 --> 01:18:34.96 普通 chiefs and and the the task unit senior to the vice-versa I was like hey guys got a
01:18:34.96 --> 01:18:41.92 talk to you we got side I was like listen guys I get it you guys need to tighten up this is
01:18:41.92 --> 01:18:47.68 bullshit you know like look I get what you're doing I get that this stuff takes place it's okay
01:18:47.68 --> 01:18:52.56 but if you're gonna be stupid about what you're doing we're all gonna get in trouble and it's
01:18:52.56 --> 01:18:57.28 gonna be a problem so tighten it up and don't only see this shit anymore and the guys are like
01:18:57.28 --> 01:19:04.48 hey Roger that I literally walk inside the compound or I walk back inside the building
01:19:05.04 --> 01:19:10.80 and you and you had showed up like while I was talking to those guys and you got welcomed to your
01:19:10.80 --> 01:19:20.64 tattooed by getting you know assaulted and your head partially shaved like they didn't do a good job
01:19:20.64 --> 01:19:29.60 and so I'm standing there and I come walking walking in and someone's like hey Kim go report to
01:19:29.60 --> 01:19:34.88 the commander you have no idea who I am but they they're like pointing at me and you look like you just
01:19:34.88 --> 01:19:40.72 I mean your eyes are freaking giant and you just look like you just walked into into the
01:19:40.72 --> 01:19:46.88 craziest things you've ever seen and you come walking ready you got a ball cap on and I'm looking
01:19:46.88 --> 01:19:52.96 at you and you're standing at a position of attention I mean it's just hilarious and and I'm looking at
01:19:52.96 --> 01:19:59.44 your hair and I can see that the guys have obviously just roughed you up and partially like
01:19:59.44 --> 01:20:06.40 shaved chunks out of your hair I do like serum on belly officer Kim or I'm HM3 Kim or HM2 Kim
01:20:06.40 --> 01:20:10.56 whenever you were I'm reporting on board and I was like hey bro nice to meet you man
01:20:10.56 --> 01:20:15.92 and just something really chill like that but that was pretty funny that's the backstory
01:20:15.92 --> 01:20:21.60 the guys meet just literally tighten them up and tell them not to be idiots and I walk in
01:20:21.60 --> 01:20:27.12 and four seconds later I'm meeting you and it looked like you just got slapped around and you're
01:20:27.12 --> 01:20:36.16 head shaved that's I have never heard that backstory yeah it's amazing yeah I got I got
01:20:36.16 --> 01:20:42.56 well cut that I think it was a mallet that I think I had a mallet that was given a mallet
01:20:43.84 --> 01:20:47.12 that's right because you had really long hair too coming out of sniper school and I would
01:20:47.12 --> 01:20:52.40 see you in a while oh yeah long hair they weren't gonna have no this is who is this new guy showing
01:20:52.40 --> 01:20:59.68 up long hair yeah not totally asked for it but you know so many emotions when you show up
01:20:59.68 --> 01:21:05.52 your petoni like a lot of guys I was just so hungry to be accepted to be a good job like
01:21:05.52 --> 01:21:09.84 look I can put out I'm gonna ask it like I want to be here because I want to be here
01:21:11.20 --> 01:21:18.88 and getting welcome like that was I I wanted that and it's a different world I feel like I was
01:21:18.88 --> 01:21:26.48 fortunate enough to see two sides of the Navy because that is certainly not at all condoning
01:21:26.48 --> 01:21:33.44 that behavior but it is what it is it is what it was and I've kind of at the cost where I got to
01:21:33.44 --> 01:21:37.92 see that side of the teams and I'm sure it's still those on but it's changed a little bit right
01:21:38.88 --> 01:21:43.20 but it changed a lot it was on a glide slope the whole time that I was in I mean when I first showed
01:21:43.20 --> 01:21:48.48 up to the teams it was it was dumb and out of control you know and what you know and just like
01:21:48.48 --> 01:21:52.48 what you're saying like there's parts where you go oh yeah that made sense and then there was
01:21:52.48 --> 01:21:57.04 other people that were just idiots and it was totally out of control and it needed to be tightened up
01:21:57.04 --> 01:22:02.80 and and I saw that glide slope the whole time I was in and you know it got to a point where
01:22:02.80 --> 01:22:07.44 which is what it was kind of like for us like hey idiots what are you doing if I'm the commander
01:22:07.44 --> 01:22:12.96 and I see what you idiots are doing you're wrong you know and don't be stupid and don't do
01:22:12.96 --> 01:22:19.28 things that you're going to get in trouble I mean just dumb stuff you know so there's you know
01:22:19.28 --> 01:22:25.20 unfortunately it's a hard thing to police because in order to police it you'd have to say okay
01:22:25.20 --> 01:22:30.24 you can do this but you can't do that hey when I when I first joined I was on a ship and we
01:22:30.24 --> 01:22:35.68 went across the the dam a quater and it was a you know you become a divvierver her to this
01:22:35.68 --> 01:22:40.96 you become a shell back yeah yeah so I did that it was one of the worst hazing sessions I ever
01:22:40.96 --> 01:22:46.72 had it was completely condoled by the entire U.S. Navy let's a shell back um someone that has
01:22:47.44 --> 01:22:53.52 been over the equator so if you if you've you've never crossed the equator then you then you're uh
01:22:53.52 --> 01:22:58.64 then you're uh what's it a walk I think it's a polywag or a wag but they call you a wag and then
01:22:58.64 --> 01:23:04.32 once you go across the the equator you go through this big ceremony which is just a big hazing session
01:23:04.32 --> 01:23:10.08 then you become a trusty shell back which is okay yeah and I mean they did everything that
01:23:10.96 --> 01:23:15.04 that would happen and like you know they were dunking their feeding crappy foods they were
01:23:15.04 --> 01:23:22.08 beating you with like um uh cut off fire hoses it was legit hazing yeah and of course
01:23:23.28 --> 01:23:27.68 some of that stuff you go okay I get it it's a tradition it's a welcome aboard like you said it's a
01:23:27.68 --> 01:23:32.000 welcome and of course there's people at our idiots that take too far and that's what you
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.16 that's what you end up having to correct for you have to have end up having to correct for
01:23:36.16 --> 01:23:41.84 people that are stupid people that are sadistic people that don't have any common sense
01:23:41.84 --> 01:23:48.64 and it turns into a problem so yeah everything you said is on point I think you have to understand
01:23:48.64 --> 01:23:54.16 the we intent behind an action right if it's malicious which sometimes it turns malicious for some
01:23:54.16 --> 01:24:01.44 people that's not right now if it's a way to welcome someone aboard a field part of you know
01:24:01.44 --> 01:24:08.32 the brotherhood the sisterhood like welcome this is what it's like um I think the spirit of that is
01:24:09.52 --> 01:24:16.40 I understand the spirit of that but you're right it it requires people to be judicious to have
01:24:17.52 --> 01:24:23.04 to exercise good common sense and unfortunately that doesn't always happen yeah and the blanket
01:24:23.04 --> 01:24:28.40 thing that happens in a big organization like the Navy is they okay look we we don't know how to
01:24:28.40 --> 01:24:31.84 we don't know how to judiciously do this we don't want to put regulations around it so we're not
01:24:31.84 --> 01:24:36.96 doing it anymore and you know that was actually one of the worst things that used to happen if there
01:24:36.96 --> 01:24:44.08 was a guy that people that that a platoon sort of rejected like an organ rejection where you know you
01:24:44.08 --> 01:24:50.40 get a kidney transplant and your body can reject it sometimes that happens in a platoon and and what
01:24:50.40 --> 01:24:55.68 would happen it wouldn't it be the opposite it'd be like that guy's not getting hazed he's not
01:24:55.68 --> 01:25:00.72 getting you know rassed by the troops people aren't making fun of him for this that or the other thing
01:25:01.04 --> 01:25:05.68 that's when you that's when you know a guy's a real problem is when he's actually so far outside
01:25:05.68 --> 01:25:10.000 that's spectrum that they go you know what we don't even we don't even want to we don't even want to
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.04 do that with this guy because he's not one of us and we don't want him as part of the team
01:25:13.04 --> 01:25:21.04 wise words I've always heard that I believe it if if you weren't getting rattle if you weren't
01:25:21.04 --> 01:25:26.16 being made fun of then people didn't like you and that's just the coach I think it's hard for
01:25:26.16 --> 01:25:33.12 people outside of that community to understand why we were so hard in each other and why it was
01:25:33.12 --> 01:25:41.28 born out of love it really is it's a a lot of those actions and you just the way we conducted ourselves
01:25:41.28 --> 01:25:48.32 and I mean some of the people closest friends we were just you know just dog on each other all the
01:25:48.32 --> 01:25:55.28 time to this day yeah it's it's a it's a I guess weird environment to grow up and because I'm like
01:25:55.28 --> 01:26:01.76 you like I joined the Navy when I was 18 and that's what you that's what you you just go into this
01:26:01.76 --> 01:26:07.44 environment and it's just like you're saying when I got into that environment I was like this is so
01:26:07.44 --> 01:26:13.36 awesome this is the coolest thing ever this is the people I want to be around with forever and yeah
01:26:13.36 --> 01:26:18.56 you know what if you got out of line you would get tightened up you would get tightened up and you know
01:26:18.56 --> 01:26:24.24 that's something I I've talked about is like in task unit bruiser I'm the commander of task
01:26:24.24 --> 01:26:31.20 in bruiser the amount of times that I personally had to tighten up a guy for being late was zero
01:26:31.20 --> 01:26:35.36 the amount of times I had to personally tighten up a guy for forgetting his gear was zero
01:26:35.36 --> 01:26:39.12 the amount of times I had to tighten someone up for being out of uniform was zero because the
01:26:39.12 --> 01:26:43.92 freaking gang took care of that and the gang was gonna make sure that we were square it away
01:26:43.92 --> 01:26:49.52 and and that's what that mentality is kind of like it's kind of like a gang mentality as it should be
01:26:50.32 --> 01:26:59.52 in that respect yeah yeah um but that was your welcome aboard was that was um funny so and so
01:26:59.52 --> 01:27:05.12 then all of a sudden you're you're dropped into the middle of work up and now you see the
01:27:05.76 --> 01:27:09.28 now you see what now you see what actually being a seal is about is lilies like now
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:17.44 that that first trip mm-hmm did it meet your expectations it did absolutely and and exceeded
01:27:18.16 --> 01:27:27.04 what expectations I had no I didn't have a benchmark of what a normal put tune was and actually
01:27:27.04 --> 01:27:35.76 I think I just kind of thought all let me let me back up a bit what I've done to the teams
01:27:35.76 --> 01:27:42.48 is a drop in the bucket compared to what you've done and what a lot of our brothers have done
01:27:42.48 --> 01:27:46.40 you know I've got friends who've done ten plus deployments to take that one step further
01:27:46.40 --> 01:27:50.08 you say what you've done in the teams is a drop in the bucket compared to me which is not
01:27:50.08 --> 01:27:55.92 completely accurate but even if you accept that fact what I've done in the teams is a drop in the
01:27:55.92 --> 01:28:04.96 bucket compared to other guys that were in in longer time better time more extreme situations
01:28:04.96 --> 01:28:11.84 so yes it goes without saying that both of us look man we I mean for me I did what I could do
01:28:11.84 --> 01:28:16.96 while I was in you did what you could do while you were in but goes it doesn't go without saying
01:28:16.96 --> 01:28:22.64 we're both saying it what we did in the teams it was a fraction a little miniscule compared to
01:28:22.64 --> 01:28:29.20 you first of all the teams as a whole and second of all plenty of individuals who are way better
01:28:29.20 --> 01:28:34.88 waste martyr did ten times the deployments that you and I did which is crazy to think about
01:28:34.88 --> 01:28:41.20 but that's what happens so yes in that extent the other services like arm marine
01:28:41.20 --> 01:28:47.44 core brothers and sisters for sure armies holders air force I mean just drop in the bucket but
01:28:47.44 --> 01:28:53.60 in that context I didn't know what a like a normal but tuned was so I kind of thought all
01:28:53.60 --> 01:28:58.80 put tunes were like Charlie Pintune a task in a bruiser and I've come to realize later on
01:28:58.80 --> 01:29:03.76 that we were maybe a little more aggressive than the average man the average task unit
01:29:04.88 --> 01:29:10.08 but I loved it and that's I was finally in the situation that I wanted to do
01:29:10.08 --> 01:29:16.80 that I felt a calling to when I was growing up in my adolescent years that I felt I was born to
01:29:16.80 --> 01:29:26.000 do and for the first time I felt accepted I never felt accepted growing up not even
01:29:28.64 --> 01:29:34.72 sure I had friends and you know I went to a Korean church and I had some Korean friends
01:29:35.52 --> 01:29:41.36 from my parents but in a lot of ways I was always felt in between worlds and that had an impact
01:29:41.36 --> 01:29:49.60 on me like I didn't really feel well accepted by the by in a lot of ways the Korean American
01:29:49.60 --> 01:29:55.68 community because I was I remember just being teased just because I was like too white
01:29:56.24 --> 01:30:01.44 I think one time I had I had skateboarding shoes when I went like my Korean church and I just got
01:30:02.56 --> 01:30:08.64 made fun of it for and I just you know so I just just kind of funny to think about and I think
01:30:08.64 --> 01:30:12.80 it just laughed at all like it's just ridiculous but when you're a kid and that's your world
01:30:13.36 --> 01:30:20.48 it means a lot so I never felt like I was accepted to a group until I was in the teams
01:30:21.44 --> 01:30:28.16 and I was for the first time I was home and I loved it.
01:30:30.72 --> 01:30:37.44 I you know I had to go to college in the middle of my co-career and I was talking to a professor
01:30:37.44 --> 01:30:44.16 and my professor I was saying to this professor well you know I just can't wait I was just kind
01:30:44.16 --> 01:30:48.72 of finished this course because I so I can get back to the teams and the guy was looking at me
01:30:48.72 --> 01:30:54.80 like I was completely insane like I was completely crazy because the war had started and I'm saying
01:30:54.80 --> 01:30:58.80 I just want to get this so I can get out of here so I can go back to the teams and he's looking at me
01:30:58.80 --> 01:31:06.16 like I'm literally like I'm crazy and he says like whoa like don't you like going to school
01:31:06.16 --> 01:31:10.88 and when you rather just stay here next to two semesters and and you know just go to classes and
01:31:10.88 --> 01:31:16.56 run and I was like oh I said I would leave right now if the Navy would let me I would leave right
01:31:16.56 --> 01:31:23.28 now with no degree I don't care about this and he's like why it was incomprehensible to him and I
01:31:23.28 --> 01:31:28.88 sat there and I looked at him and I said and it sounds really freaking horrible to say this I guess
01:31:28.88 --> 01:31:34.56 if you put it in the in the view of identity politics but I look at him and I go because in the
01:31:34.56 --> 01:31:41.44 teams everyone's like me and I don't mean it that they're like me that they're that they're white
01:31:41.44 --> 01:31:47.36 males I mean they're like me and it doesn't matter what background they come from it doesn't
01:31:47.36 --> 01:31:53.52 matter if they're Korean or Mexican or black or white it doesn't matter they're like me they're
01:31:53.52 --> 01:31:58.24 think they're gonna laugh at the same stupid jokes they're gonna they're gonna throw daggers at me
01:31:58.24 --> 01:32:02.56 that I'm gonna expect to be able to deal with I'm gonna throw daggers back at them that's and
01:32:02.56 --> 01:32:07.68 if things get escalated they can get out of control and they'll get we'll go toe to toe that's
01:32:07.68 --> 01:32:13.60 what happens in the teams and then we'll shake hands and have a beer and so that feeling of
01:32:13.60 --> 01:32:21.04 when you get to a platoon and you're like oh thank you world because now you put me with these other
01:32:21.04 --> 01:32:27.04 dudes and they're like me and we can take we can take on it's us against the world
01:32:27.04 --> 01:32:34.96 that's a damn good fuel it's a brotherhood and it's hard to articulate that feeling that you
01:32:34.96 --> 01:32:41.84 described but for all those things you said yes so let's talk a little bit more about work up
01:32:42.72 --> 01:32:49.44 and you know the desert training to me there's no better way to start off a work up than going through
01:32:49.44 --> 01:32:58.96 that desert training it's hard it was August it was 120 degrees outside it was brutal we were
01:32:58.96 --> 01:33:08.48 thirsty we were tired and we were getting after it there's nothing lankin I think my I clearly
01:33:08.48 --> 01:33:14.32 remember that first night and they were like let's go in a little patrol little shake out patrol
01:33:14.32 --> 01:33:22.000 shake out patrol and this so guys like all right I'll maybe bring a cantine I'll bring a leader maybe
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.60 half of this camel back well maybe he's won't bring anything I'll be good and the shake out patrol
01:33:29.60 --> 01:33:37.44 became like an all night patrol of just marching through in this heat and it's nighttime but it's
01:33:37.44 --> 01:33:42.08 still sweltering hot and I remember folks just running out of water
01:33:42.08 --> 01:33:47.84 rare here early on I think Ryan Joe I don't even know if you brought any water and just
01:33:47.84 --> 01:33:56.48 suffering through it but things like that stick with you that kind of mutual suffering and
01:33:56.48 --> 01:34:07.44 hardship I I'm a firm believer that hard shared hardship and suffering is one of the best ways
01:34:07.44 --> 01:34:12.72 to bring people together towards a common goal to break down barriers to form
01:34:13.52 --> 01:34:20.56 and brought a sisterhood whatever you want to call it yeah that's that's that's what the team
01:34:20.56 --> 01:34:26.64 does and it's as you mentioned earlier it's not just what the team does every military unit when you
01:34:26.64 --> 01:34:33.12 go through boot camp in the navy okay maybe it's a different kind of hardship but there's a sleep
01:34:33.12 --> 01:34:38.32 deprivation there's a weird food scenario going on there's tasks that have to be done
01:34:38.32 --> 01:34:43.52 there's hammer sessions that take place like all those things they're unifying you and then you
01:34:43.52 --> 01:34:47.76 go to the next step and you get unified tighter and then you go to the next you go to budge you get unified
01:34:47.76 --> 01:34:51.76 tighter then you can show up in a sealed pitoon and now you're going through a hard work up and you're
01:34:51.76 --> 01:35:00.32 going to get unified even tighter and it's awesome do you um we rolled from there other I mean
01:35:00.32 --> 01:35:05.28 other aspects of work up was there anything that you were nervous about going through work up
01:35:05.28 --> 01:35:09.12 because you were and and I was going to say this earlier you know you said that you were a
01:35:09.12 --> 01:35:12.72 gray man going through buds meaning that you weren't great at anything but you weren't horrible
01:35:12.72 --> 01:35:16.72 anything and that was exactly the same way I was I wasn't great anything it wasn't horrible at
01:35:16.72 --> 01:35:23.68 anything I made it through in one shot because I wasn't I guess it wasn't as good as you but I
01:35:23.68 --> 01:35:28.16 because I failed I failed a little bit of everything but not enough of anything to get me rolled
01:35:28.16 --> 01:35:36.88 off so I've met a bit on the the the the Saturn or weaker side of the gray man but work up
01:35:38.24 --> 01:35:44.56 you you know as the as the guy that was running it the only people that kind of
01:35:45.68 --> 01:35:49.28 that showed up on my radar a lot where people that were having problems and you
01:35:50.16 --> 01:35:53.44 didn't show up on radar as having problems you were pretty much could do everything
01:35:53.44 --> 01:36:03.12 I mean what I appreciated about the teams was that it was a true meritocracy you got out of it
01:36:03.12 --> 01:36:09.12 what you put in and my original fears of being the menic of being boxed into just that
01:36:09.12 --> 01:36:14.000 responsibility because I wanted to do more I wanted to be the best asset I could be to my
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:21.68 patreon to to my brothers and I quickly fell under the mentorship of many other people on the
01:36:21.68 --> 01:36:28.96 batoon Chris Cal was the primary sniper navigator point man and new guys kind of get
01:36:29.76 --> 01:36:33.52 matched up to a person he was the person I got matched up to because I would eventually be
01:36:33.52 --> 01:36:41.36 groomed to take on his responsibilities so early on I got tasked with being like the assistant lead
01:36:41.36 --> 01:36:50.24 now and point man and sniper which eventually got to take on these roles more a primary
01:36:51.20 --> 01:36:57.92 leader and workup and also on the point man so that meant that responsibility meant so much to me
01:36:58.56 --> 01:37:05.12 and I wanted to practice and train and wake up early and make sure just because I didn't want to
01:37:05.12 --> 01:37:13.60 mess it up not for myself but because I felt I owed and I did owe that responsibility
01:37:15.92 --> 01:37:20.96 of doing a good job to my patreon yeah I don't know that there's any greater people talk
01:37:20.96 --> 01:37:25.84 about motivation I don't know that there's any greater motivation is then I don't want to let my
01:37:25.84 --> 01:37:32.08 guys down and whether that's hey I don't look I know the entire patrol is following me as the
01:37:32.08 --> 01:37:38.72 point man or as the lead nav and if I mess this up I'm taking the whole patrol with me to be clear
01:37:38.72 --> 01:37:45.60 I messed up plenty of times I might in my pothole let me know about it I messed up plenty of times
01:37:46.32 --> 01:37:53.20 but still just trying that never ending pursuit to be better and to accept responsibility for your
01:37:53.20 --> 01:38:00.40 failures and promise you will do better that's what the workup is and you know we had a we had a
01:38:00.40 --> 01:38:08.96 great workup we went hard and in that workup and eventually we completed the workup we
01:38:11.44 --> 01:38:16.000 and we got ready we already go on deployment and you guys actually went on leave I don't know
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.12 if you remember this we were going we were deploying to Baghdad that was the plan and we I had
01:38:21.12 --> 01:38:26.96 actually gone with a couple of the guys on pre-deployment site survey and checked out where we were
01:38:26.96 --> 01:38:32.40 going to be deploying to in Baghdad we were going to be doing you know basic direct action missions
01:38:32.40 --> 01:38:40.16 catching bad guys and pretty straightforward in that in that Baghdad area pretty straightforward
01:38:40.16 --> 01:38:46.56 deployment was what we were heading for and everyone went on leave and during that leave period
01:38:47.36 --> 01:38:54.24 I got called in and I actually don't even know if I took leave but I was at work and our boss
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:59.52 our commanding officer you know called me in and said hey you guys aren't going to go to Baghdad anymore
01:38:59.52 --> 01:39:05.60 and actually he asked me like hey we're thinking about shifting things around how would you feel
01:39:05.60 --> 01:39:14.32 about going to Romani and I knew it was going on to Romani we don't well on if we all knew but I
01:39:14.32 --> 01:39:21.04 definitely knew it was going to Romani I knew how bad it was I knew it was the area where the most
01:39:21.04 --> 01:39:27.20 enemy was and where the most enemy contact was and where if we were going to fight that would be
01:39:27.20 --> 01:39:32.96 the place to go and you know what I talked to him and said yeah well we can make those adjustments
01:39:32.96 --> 01:39:38.000 and by the time you guys came back and off a leave we were we were then going to Romani
01:39:39.20 --> 01:39:47.68 yeah that decision making was that was not a were of that you know I was happy being just
01:39:47.68 --> 01:39:53.76 an E5 shooter and I do remember that yeah I can back and leave we're going to Romani
01:39:53.76 --> 01:39:57.84 place that I hadn't heard yeah I was going to say did you even know the difference were you
01:39:57.84 --> 01:40:05.60 just like whatever going to Iraq I'm happy yeah I mean I was 21 22 and I want to think about
01:40:06.48 --> 01:40:12.72 I was just a kid like what I know now based on what I knew back then it's just crazy
01:40:12.72 --> 01:40:21.92 yeah to me I don't think that was I don't think I was aware as aware I knew it was a bad place
01:40:21.92 --> 01:40:27.28 I don't think I was not to the same level as you of what was going on the the say gax going on
01:40:27.28 --> 01:40:34.88 at that time yeah I was I guess I was probably playing paying more attention
01:40:35.68 --> 01:40:41.52 to what was going on there and actually Romani had been really bad for a while
01:40:41.52 --> 01:40:49.04 for for a pretty good chunk of time but it wasn't like the seal task you know that was there
01:40:49.68 --> 01:40:57.12 was really getting after what they didn't look that extraordinary compared to any other
01:40:57.12 --> 01:41:05.12 tasking that that wasn't Iraq at the time so but I I knew it was going to be pretty
01:41:05.12 --> 01:41:14.88 gnarly going over there and and I also knew that if anyone would be able to do a good job there
01:41:16.88 --> 01:41:21.28 I knew that we could do a good job there as a tasking it because we had worked really hard
01:41:22.08 --> 01:41:29.04 we were firing on all cylinders as you said we were a we were an aggressive tasking it
01:41:29.04 --> 01:41:37.20 for sure and I knew it would be a good environment for us to go into and one of the things that
01:41:38.32 --> 01:41:44.56 we were getting ready to leave and the Commodore who's a fantastic guy ended up at Admiral and
01:41:45.12 --> 01:41:50.40 and he I had worked for him and I had a great relationship with him he's a fantastic guy but he
01:41:50.40 --> 01:41:56.72 came to debrief or to brief all of seal team three before he went on deployment and he said
01:41:56.72 --> 01:42:02.96 something along the lines of listen no one in this room is going to shoot their guns on this
01:42:02.96 --> 01:42:08.24 deployment or he said something maybe not quite that extremely something like chances are
01:42:09.60 --> 01:42:13.84 there's no one in this room that's going to shoot their guns on this deployment and you know this
01:42:13.84 --> 01:42:20.40 is just the things are a little less kinetic so we rolled over there and need this to say
01:42:20.40 --> 01:42:26.72 within the first I would say 24 hours at the whole that the whole tasking was there the
01:42:26.72 --> 01:42:32.24 base our little base got attacked and the entire task unit including some of the texts
01:42:32.24 --> 01:42:39.28 were up on the rooftop returning fire and a few days later that Commodore showed up and I you
01:42:39.28 --> 01:42:43.20 know I gave him a hard time I said hey sir you know you said no one was going to shoot their weapons
01:42:43.20 --> 01:42:48.64 and I said this entire task unit and most of the texts I've actually gave to the enemy at this time
01:42:48.64 --> 01:42:53.12 so that was a little welcome aboard I remember that night it was a good welcome and I remember
01:42:53.12 --> 01:42:59.28 some of the texts going through like six mags like the first couple minutes and like let's slow our
01:42:59.28 --> 01:43:07.68 roll down but yeah it was a good I think it became very clear the situation we found ourselves
01:43:07.68 --> 01:43:13.04 and and I agree I think we were as prepared as we could have been for that situation
01:43:13.04 --> 01:43:20.32 then what how long did it take you after being on the ground what was the first what was the
01:43:20.32 --> 01:43:26.88 first op you did it was the DA the the kind of one this is the one life and I joke about because
01:43:26.88 --> 01:43:32.24 the life was like life is like we're not going to be ready we're we should roll it we shouldn't do it
01:43:32.96 --> 01:43:38.16 and you know we've you know we've him and I've talked about this on the podcast I think which was
01:43:38.16 --> 01:43:43.44 I was like bro it's gonna be okay you got this and he was like he was nervous man because it was
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:51.12 this is first op in Ramadi there's mayhem going on and you know I just I just looked at him
01:43:51.12 --> 01:43:57.20 and said bro you got this is not gonna be that hard and he was like Roger and you know he sucked it up
01:43:57.20 --> 01:44:04.40 and you guys went and executed the op no big deal you know no factor but it was surely
01:44:04.40 --> 01:44:10.64 thereafter that I started looking at a different strategy besides just doing DAs and moving
01:44:10.64 --> 01:44:16.72 more towards these overwatches and then we kind of started moving in that direction didn't take
01:44:16.72 --> 01:44:25.44 very long the brigade commander like almost out of the gate asked for our support in areas that
01:44:25.44 --> 01:44:31.76 were being heavily ID where we could go out and start introducing people that were putting in IDs
01:44:31.76 --> 01:44:39.92 what was that like for you from your perspective as a new guy what was your just tell people
01:44:39.92 --> 01:44:50.000 about your job what what that was like yeah so I early on in the deployment I was we had a lot of
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.32 snipers you know and and the way the team's works and I'm sure you've said on previous podcasts
01:44:56.32 --> 01:45:02.40 everyone has multiple jobs we overlap responsibilities and so many ways we have you know half
01:45:02.40 --> 01:45:07.60 of the guys might be breachers so anyone can put an example in a slap and explosive on the door
01:45:07.60 --> 01:45:12.24 and and use the right one the appropriate one to get through to gain access to a building
01:45:12.24 --> 01:45:18.88 you know have you know a quarter of the guys our snipers so we cross we were able to fill in
01:45:18.88 --> 01:45:24.96 each other's roles and early on I was the assistant point man and navigator
01:45:24.96 --> 01:45:33.04 and one one of the snipers and of course the medic and at the time it was Chris leading a lot of
01:45:33.04 --> 01:45:39.60 those so it's learning from him how to as an navigator you're responsible for coming up with
01:45:39.60 --> 01:45:50.56 a ideal but safe route to your destination and you don't realize it at the time because you
01:45:50.56 --> 01:45:55.92 know you're just e4 e5 at the time just going through you think it's normal but that's so much
01:45:55.92 --> 01:46:02.40 responsibility to be able to come up with a plan on your own to review the cigarettes hey you know
01:46:02.40 --> 01:46:10.88 intersection I think it was two nine three two nine three which would have like double digit
01:46:10.88 --> 01:46:17.12 cigarettes a day and we're realizing hey what's probably go a different way or go through this
01:46:17.12 --> 01:46:25.60 alleyway and reviewing the satellite imagery to see and understanding and trying to go through
01:46:25.60 --> 01:46:32.16 do like a dirt dive which is just space was just planning the route in your head and seeing
01:46:32.16 --> 01:46:38.40 what kind of obstacles you might see or landmarks because GPS wasn't super reliable at the time
01:46:39.20 --> 01:46:44.80 especially since we had jammers you'll want on 24 seven so that people couldn't remotely
01:46:44.80 --> 01:46:50.48 detonate ideas we'd try and jam all all frequencies so a lot of times you didn't have GPS so
01:46:50.48 --> 01:46:59.28 you need to know the route cold and then as a point man being able to take to dismount safely
01:46:59.28 --> 01:47:05.52 and then guide your platoon to the target on foot and that also takes careful route
01:47:06.16 --> 01:47:13.44 planning careful route study and making sure you get the right target because I mean you can have
01:47:13.44 --> 01:47:22.000 pretty bad consequences when you hit the right hit the wrong target and of course your shooter just
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.16 like everyone everyone's a shooter from the lowest and listed to the OIC is a shooter is responsible
01:47:28.16 --> 01:47:35.60 for their lanes for engaging the enemy for a turning fire for being a shooter and once you're on
01:47:35.60 --> 01:47:42.96 target if this is happens to be an overwatch we'd set up the night before and set up sniper
01:47:42.96 --> 01:47:51.76 overwatch positions so that we had good observations of different angles different lanes that the
01:47:51.76 --> 01:48:01.12 enemy might try and use to attack us or worse attack our brethren our army and marine corps
01:48:01.12 --> 01:48:05.12 brothers and sisters who might be doing a route clearance or might be doing a patrol
01:48:06.64 --> 01:48:10.32 and that's just like one flavor of the many different types of missions that we did
01:48:10.32 --> 01:48:16.32 you know we talked about DA direct action missions those were a little more direct you know you
01:48:16.32 --> 01:48:24.40 probably just drive up this and require as much I guess you know trying to be as seraptitious
01:48:24.40 --> 01:48:28.64 it's kind of going in loud you're not feeling anyone you're going loud aggressive hard
01:48:29.44 --> 01:48:37.44 and it's just a different flavor of a mission and those were just kind of an idea of the kinds of
01:48:37.44 --> 01:48:42.40 things that I did and a lot of our petrified mates did how do you like working with Chris
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:52.64 I learned a lot from Chris it was you need to use a hard teacher but I learned a lot of
01:48:53.68 --> 01:49:02.000 important lessons from that and I feel like I I've been fortunate to have a lot of
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:08.48 teachers and mentors role models along the way throughout life the life is certainly one
01:49:10.16 --> 01:49:17.84 high school teachers you know medical school at NASA my current job and just trying to take a
01:49:17.84 --> 01:49:23.92 little bit of what they teach you those pearls and incorporate into your own style to what works for you
01:49:24.48 --> 01:49:30.32 and certainly with Chris I had a lot of those pearls that I learned to help me become a better operator
01:49:30.32 --> 01:49:46.48 and a better leader now as you're doing these missions and you know it was there there was a lot of
01:49:46.48 --> 01:49:53.28 a lot of violence happening a lot of violence happening our army and Marine Corps brothers
01:49:53.28 --> 01:50:02.48 were getting wounded almost wounded or killed almost on a daily basis the amount of
01:50:03.52 --> 01:50:10.32 enemy attacks was basically almost 24 hours a day there were enemy attacks happening inside the city
01:50:10.32 --> 01:50:17.28 there were massive IDs that were just sickening you know you could hear them you to hear them
01:50:17.28 --> 01:50:22.80 on base go off or for your out and town you could hear them go off and you know that when they went off
01:50:23.60 --> 01:50:28.88 there was there was wounded and mutilated and maimed and killed Americans I mean every single
01:50:28.88 --> 01:50:38.48 time you'd hear one of those it would you make me cringe as you continued to roll out
01:50:40.16 --> 01:50:45.28 you know day after day what was your what was your mindset you know I've talked to
01:50:45.28 --> 01:50:53.04 a lot of combat vets and and right down to one of the guys that I had on named Dean Lad
01:50:53.04 --> 01:51:01.04 who was the Marine in World War II who was gut shot walking to the beach in Tahrua this is
01:51:01.04 --> 01:51:06.96 after he did Ewo I mean just a or Guadalcanal and you know I was talking to him about it he's like
01:51:06.96 --> 01:51:16.48 I never thought it would happen to me that was kind of what cleared his mind but those guys
01:51:16.48 --> 01:51:21.36 I mean it's a different type of combat where look you're they're gonna do this this assault
01:51:22.24 --> 01:51:28.000 and it's gonna last two three four days before they get to kind of settle in they had less time to
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.56 think about it without a doubt they had less time to think about it they weren't coming back to
01:51:32.56 --> 01:51:40.32 a base like we were where you're relatively safe and then you got to reload and go back again
01:51:40.32 --> 01:51:48.16 how did that play outside 21 year old Johnny Kim's mind yeah and I don't think I've ever been asked
01:51:48.16 --> 01:51:54.88 not that it's a pretty insightful question and I don't think I've asked other people
01:51:54.88 --> 01:52:04.16 what mental calculus what things they needed to go through to prepare themselves for these
01:52:05.04 --> 01:52:12.32 for these challenges I know what I did and what worked for me and I don't doubt I don't know
01:52:12.32 --> 01:52:18.16 if it works for other people or if that's what other people did but I mean I don't I have no
01:52:18.16 --> 01:52:27.68 qualms saying but when I showed up to Iraq I was scared I mean my first deployment and on your
01:52:27.68 --> 01:52:32.16 first deployment to a war zone I don't know if other people but I was in the frame like oh
01:52:32.16 --> 01:52:38.88 as soon as I step off this bird into country I'm gonna get shot at which is not at all the case
01:52:38.88 --> 01:52:45.04 right um there's varying levels of intensity in the war right I mean there were some
01:52:45.04 --> 01:52:52.000 bases where you had Taco Bell and pizza Hut right and then you had like the sticks where
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:59.92 Marines were rough in it and sleeping in holes and they ground um that look like graves and so
01:52:59.92 --> 01:53:12.24 they were I think varying experiences and you know for me I quickly learned my first big firefight
01:53:12.24 --> 01:53:24.16 um was I'm sure you remember this but it was an unfortunate blue on blue or blue one green
01:53:24.80 --> 01:53:31.52 incident and that was a big wakeup call to me and I'm sure we could talk a length about that
01:53:32.40 --> 01:53:37.52 a lot of lessons learned from it but I quickly learned that the mental
01:53:37.52 --> 01:53:48.40 preparation I needed to do for myself was to assume I was going to die that I was already dead
01:53:49.60 --> 01:53:58.56 and I was there to fulfill my role in the pituit as a shooter and that was liberating for me
01:53:59.76 --> 01:54:03.68 it was hard to get in that frame of mind but once you got in that frame of mind
01:54:03.68 --> 01:54:10.72 for me it was easier to stay in that frame of mind kind of like how when I was cold and
01:54:10.72 --> 01:54:14.56 buds I wanted to stay cold so there were guys who would take a warm shower if you had the
01:54:14.56 --> 01:54:23.52 opportunity to but for me I wanted to stay uncomfortable because being comfortable being uncomfortable
01:54:23.52 --> 01:54:33.52 is an important trait and once I was able to reconcile that I wasn't going to come home that I was
01:54:33.52 --> 01:54:42.16 going to die it freed me to be able to do my job without the human emotion that can be very
01:54:42.16 --> 01:54:55.12 disabling of which is fear and I think it made me more clear of mind and focused and I think it
01:54:55.12 --> 01:55:02.16 made me a better operator but I don't know if that works for everyone and I don't think that is also
01:55:02.16 --> 01:55:08.80 a very healthy way healthy state of mind to stay in for long periods of time I think you need to learn
01:55:08.80 --> 01:55:17.12 how to decompress and learn how to switch things on and off and have space in your brain
01:55:17.52 --> 01:55:23.52 compartmentalized spaces where you can put very bad emotions or very disabling emotions away
01:55:24.32 --> 01:55:31.20 so that you can do your job at hand that's what seemed to work for me
01:55:31.20 --> 01:55:39.84 yeah I think that's a common add to that know that as 100% what my add to it was was okay you know this
01:55:39.84 --> 01:55:47.60 is what I'm going to do and I'm going to keep doing it and there's a chance I'm going to die and
01:55:47.60 --> 01:55:54.72 that's the way it is and if it happens then that happens but I think what makes it feel
01:55:54.72 --> 01:56:04.16 liberating slash good is that any concern let's face it you can do everything right you can
01:56:04.16 --> 01:56:09.28 plan the perfect route you can manipulate your weapon perfectly you can maneuver through the
01:56:09.28 --> 01:56:13.36 streets perfectly you can still get killed whether you can get shot whether you get blown up like
01:56:13.36 --> 01:56:18.08 it can happen and if if if you're worried about things that you can control that you're wasting
01:56:18.08 --> 01:56:22.56 energy and you're not providing the correct support to the rest of your guys because you're
01:56:22.56 --> 01:56:29.20 freaked out about what's going to happen to you and that's why I think that's pretty common actually
01:56:29.20 --> 01:56:34.40 is okay look here's the risk and now I'm going to put that in a box over here I'm not going
01:56:34.40 --> 01:56:43.12 to worry about it anymore because it doesn't do me or my team any good now this is where I think the
01:56:43.76 --> 01:56:48.24 well from a leadership perspective and then from a medic slash corpsman perspective
01:56:48.24 --> 01:56:55.44 the most absolute anxiety that I had the sick twisting gut that I would have
01:56:56.24 --> 01:57:00.64 wouldn't be at all from me getting blown up or me getting shot or me getting killed or anything
01:57:00.64 --> 01:57:12.000 happened to me it was a hundred percent because of you guys and and it was impossible to not
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:19.52 it was impossible for me to not think that if you guys were rolling out or not or Delta was
01:57:19.52 --> 01:57:28.88 rolling out or opera whoever was rolling out that there was a chance look if it's not happening tonight
01:57:28.88 --> 01:57:32.56 it's going to happen tomorrow if it doesn't happen tomorrow and I deal happen in two weeks I know
01:57:32.56 --> 01:57:38.08 one of these nights the call is going to come on the radio and I know what the call is going to be
01:57:38.08 --> 01:57:43.60 I know what the call is going to be and there's it was like and again I don't want to sound fatalistic
01:57:43.60 --> 01:57:49.52 about this because I didn't think about it in a way I didn't think about it like hey throw
01:57:49.52 --> 01:57:55.68 caution when this is going to happen anyways it wasn't like that at all it was like reality
01:57:56.48 --> 01:58:04.40 the reality was you know the reality was I'm talking to the brigade commander every day I'm
01:58:04.40 --> 01:58:10.72 talking to the Italian commanders every day I know what to go on out there in some cases I'm
01:58:10.72 --> 01:58:21.28 tracking it you know by the hour and so that in my gut was the hardest was the most was the hardest
01:58:21.28 --> 01:58:28.32 thing that I had to deal with was just man just being worried about you guys that was it
01:58:28.32 --> 01:58:39.20 and I can only imagine for you as a medic same thing like you know hey you can't trade
01:58:39.20 --> 01:58:45.44 bullets with bad guys every single day you can't walk down these streets every single day
01:58:47.28 --> 01:58:55.04 and get away with it for the whole time it's just not very likely the only thing stronger than
01:58:55.04 --> 01:59:05.44 fear for self for us was fear of letting your petunate down or fear of getting your friends killed
01:59:06.16 --> 01:59:17.60 that to me is the greatest fear of all and I agree with you when if you accept that
01:59:17.60 --> 01:59:27.52 you may die you may not come home your friends may not come home it's not being complacent about it
01:59:27.52 --> 01:59:34.32 it's not being okay well I thought of my hands I'm not no you're gonna do your best you will not
01:59:34.32 --> 01:59:42.48 get complacent you will remain hard to kill you will be effective in your job but you understand
01:59:42.48 --> 01:59:54.56 the risks of the work you have ahead of you and you you accept those risks so you are free to be
01:59:54.56 --> 02:00:23.60 effective in your job so I would say that everybody I would say that we all kind of knew that the
02:00:23.60 --> 02:00:34.96 day would come and like you said I mean it wasn't a wasn't fatalistic it wasn't complacency
02:00:36.08 --> 02:00:45.12 it was the realistic assessment of where we were at and I think everybody knew that the day
02:00:45.68 --> 02:00:51.28 would come and maybe if someone says they didn't it's only because they were you know able to
02:00:51.28 --> 02:01:00.16 convince themselves that to you know to keep a positive attitude and the day did come
02:01:05.36 --> 02:01:12.56 and we'd had a couple guys get wounded you know Cowley was wounded bad
02:01:12.56 --> 02:01:25.20 a lot of clothes calls innumerable countless clothes calls which in a way kind of make you feel like
02:01:25.20 --> 02:01:34.64 maybe we can pull this off but in the end it's it's it's it's war
02:01:34.64 --> 02:01:41.60 so
02:01:46.08 --> 02:01:50.96 what did that duty you August 2 2006
02:01:50.96 --> 02:02:12.48 hard to articulate in words what that day did I talked a little bit in the
02:02:12.48 --> 02:02:20.96 beginning of how my father has shaped my actions to become the seal well I'd say the events that unfolded
02:02:20.96 --> 02:02:31.20 on August 2 2006 and days afterwards where we lost much better warriors than I much
02:02:31.20 --> 02:02:42.24 braver and selfless that the hoses were much more formative in shaping what I do and will do for the rest of my life
02:02:47.12 --> 02:02:51.68 you know we lost the actions of that day we lost two really good man
02:02:51.68 --> 02:03:08.000 um I don't even know where to start you know one of my good friends one of our good
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.88 friends Ryan Joe was hitting the face God I learned a lot that day
02:03:14.88 --> 02:03:29.84 I think we all I think we all did and a piece of us stayed there that day died with us you know Ryan was
02:03:29.84 --> 02:03:45.04 was hitting the face um yeah and I remember going single cracks are usually not good
02:03:46.16 --> 02:03:54.24 the crack you know in the crack when I say crack I mean um when you were on the giving end of a rifle
02:03:54.24 --> 02:03:59.76 you it's a much different sound than being on the receiving end of a rifle that of a bullet that's
02:03:59.76 --> 02:04:08.48 supersonic it makes a very distinctive crack and when you hear that and it's single one it
02:04:08.48 --> 02:04:16.56 generally is not good and I remember that radio call coming out from life saying that Ryan had been hit
02:04:16.56 --> 02:04:25.76 and that I was needed um whatever going to the roof and seeing Ryan lying down and a pull of his
02:04:26.48 --> 02:04:35.84 blood and uh there's these images in my head that just have so much human compassion
02:04:35.84 --> 02:04:44.08 in a crazy chaotic time and I remember life in Chris at a side and life as holding his hat
02:04:44.08 --> 02:04:49.52 holding his hand and just saying just hang on brother we just hang on me up
02:04:51.04 --> 02:04:58.56 and uh I did the best I could to stabilize Ryan but Ryan just Ryan's a trooper I mean he's he was the
02:04:58.56 --> 02:05:05.44 best of us um even then not concerned about his own welfare I'm making sure that we were safe we were
02:05:05.44 --> 02:05:15.44 being safe and staying low um and we had Mark was there laying down some good covering fire to
02:05:15.44 --> 02:05:28.000 get Ryan out of that position and I like um we called on our brothers from the army um to
02:05:28.88 --> 02:05:33.28 bring us the armor we needed to get out of there and I'm very grateful for that
02:05:33.28 --> 02:05:42.80 uh so I accompanied Ryan out of there and there's not much you can do as a medic in that
02:05:42.80 --> 02:05:48.24 situation I'm not keeping Ryan alive I'm keeping his airway open stop in the bleeding and that's
02:05:48.24 --> 02:05:54.72 it he's keeping himself alive and the definitive care he needed was a surgeon he needed to get
02:05:54.72 --> 02:06:05.44 to an operating table stat and we talked about things learned from that day failures I had one of
02:06:05.44 --> 02:06:12.000 my biggest failures from that day and it pains me to this day because Ryan didn't see it that way
02:06:14.32 --> 02:06:20.08 we stopped off at one of the aid stations I think at Cop Falcon a lot on the way
02:06:20.08 --> 02:06:29.76 which just a paint this room it was a concrete 20 feet by 20 feet room with no electricity no
02:06:29.76 --> 02:06:40.80 running water definitely not a place to get definitive care and it was being manned by you know
02:06:40.80 --> 02:06:52.08 for army physicians assistant um who I think had the best of intentions but had other
02:06:53.04 --> 02:07:05.84 clouding human emotions that resulted in poor judgment one being ego just perhaps the biggest
02:07:05.84 --> 02:07:14.72 poison of all and anything we do and just to give you an idea of this I mean it was a war zone
02:07:14.72 --> 02:07:21.28 down there I mean just a few days prior to that we had been moored in that area and a few army soldiers
02:07:21.28 --> 02:07:31.92 were hit by this mortar bad and we were pretty close in our in Cop Falcon and I went over to try and
02:07:31.92 --> 02:07:38.48 help and some of these guys were pretty hypervillemic which is a word for saying they were low on
02:07:38.48 --> 02:07:44.24 blood volume because they were losing it and I was trying to get IV access on one of these guys and I
02:07:44.24 --> 02:07:54.08 had a hard time doing it eventually was able to get a jug sticking in the neck but this the guy who
02:07:54.08 --> 02:08:03.04 was manning at the so-for was you know just giving me a hard time about it which it's fine I think we
02:08:03.76 --> 02:08:08.80 give each other a hard time we make fun of each other but I think I mean I took it hard myself because
02:08:08.80 --> 02:08:13.92 I like me and I really wanted to help these guys and I was failing and giving getting this line in
02:08:13.92 --> 02:08:25.04 and I be lying in and I was naive and just just I think insecure I was professionally embarrassed
02:08:25.04 --> 02:08:31.28 that I could not get this line in and so I know it was a little intimidated by this guy so I had
02:08:31.28 --> 02:08:37.60 that painting of this situation with this relationship with this person and coming in I knew that
02:08:37.60 --> 02:08:42.56 coming into this aid station at Cop Falcon was only gonna hurt Ryan and I was yelling at the army
02:08:42.56 --> 02:08:48.24 guys and I mean you want to you know E2 drivers we're just doing what they were told I'm like we need to go
02:08:48.80 --> 02:08:55.68 to camp her body right now to get to an OR and they were telling me we need to stop by this aid we
02:08:55.68 --> 02:09:04.64 have orders to stop off of this aid station and Ryan's on this cot and I mean there's no way to get
02:09:04.64 --> 02:09:09.60 definitive care you can't even be sterile in this area I mean this is a concrete room with
02:09:09.60 --> 02:09:16.48 no electricity and he was trying to give a nasal fair out an MPA nasal fair and geol airway
02:09:16.48 --> 02:09:21.28 to Ryan which is a little remember the trumpet nose you put in you know keeps an airway secure
02:09:23.44 --> 02:09:31.28 but you never ever give an MPA to folks listening to this who have any kind of medical background
02:09:31.28 --> 02:09:37.84 you would never give an MPA to someone with suspected facial with suspected mapsilare fractures which is
02:09:37.84 --> 02:09:45.20 what Ryan certainly had had to be shot through the left cheek right around around the left orbit
02:09:46.48 --> 02:09:54.000 and I was top of my lungs arguing with this guy this is not what he needed like you should not do
02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:00.32 that we needed to get to camp her body and there was a certain power differential right I mean
02:10:00.32 --> 02:10:08.88 I was E5 21 22 old kid and I had this O4 who was telling me how things should be done and Ryan's there
02:10:11.44 --> 02:10:22.000 hearing all this and I like a lot of army regulations I'm not trying to
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:30.32 give any disrespect to the army but the two drivers who drove me there were like you need
02:10:30.32 --> 02:10:35.12 to clear and save your weapon and you know if you remember there's always a barrel outside of
02:10:35.12 --> 02:10:39.44 every building of the clearance safe it I understand because there's a lot of accidents and all
02:10:39.44 --> 02:10:45.28 this charge that happened in the military but for teen guys I think that's like clearing your
02:10:45.28 --> 02:10:49.28 having to point your weapon in a barrel the clearance safe it is not really you don't need to
02:10:49.28 --> 02:10:52.32 do that we just clearance safe in the safe direction right just be responsible have
02:10:53.68 --> 02:10:59.44 accountability for muscle awareness and what you're doing is like and I was trying to fight this
02:10:59.44 --> 02:11:05.68 fight with this with this PA and the other army soldiers were trying to like you need to
02:11:05.68 --> 02:11:10.80 you need to go inside right now and clear the weapon so frustrated I left clear my weapon to came back
02:11:10.80 --> 02:11:20.24 and PA hit and turned the PA's right and Ryan was coughing up blood and bad and I saw the look
02:11:20.24 --> 02:11:29.92 on this PA's face that he I think he recognized that this was outside his scope of abilities
02:11:30.64 --> 02:11:39.04 and that he was in over his head and may have hurt Ryan and from there my request to get to
02:11:39.04 --> 02:11:45.76 camp Ramon he was immediately fulfilled and we got back in the load Ryan and got Ryan to
02:11:45.76 --> 02:11:52.64 camp Ramon to the appropriate level of care to awaiting surgeons doctors to take care of Ryan
02:11:53.92 --> 02:12:01.04 but to me that's one of my biggest failures because I let Ryan down and what PA
02:12:01.04 --> 02:12:09.68 intemies that in the years afterwards he always thanked me that I stood up for him and Ryan I
02:12:10.64 --> 02:12:18.88 I don't know why you're thanking me I failed you I could have done something more I could have
02:12:21.44 --> 02:12:24.96 could have stood up for my friend a little bit more I could have
02:12:24.96 --> 02:12:33.60 I don't know what I could have done but I could have done something he Ryan deserved better
02:12:34.88 --> 02:12:42.16 and who knows what this did I mean Ryan was blind as you know afterwards but he says I was the last
02:12:42.16 --> 02:12:53.60 person he saw he wishes I was a little prettier Ryan lightly became blind secondary to infections
02:12:53.60 --> 02:13:04.40 swelling trauma but maybe that was the final straw that made him blind and eventually led to him
02:13:05.76 --> 02:13:09.76 getting all those surgeries which eventually took his life as you know he had multiple surgeries
02:13:09.76 --> 02:13:19.28 and one of his surgeries he was unfortunately taken from us I don't know but I made a promise
02:13:19.28 --> 02:13:25.44 after that that regardless of my rank of where I stood or of what kind of power differential I was
02:13:25.44 --> 02:13:32.64 if I saw something wrong like that and I knew someone would get hurt that I would stand up and
02:13:32.64 --> 02:13:46.72 speak and not let something like that ever happen again we see things happen all the time that we
02:13:46.72 --> 02:13:51.92 know aren't right you know a lot you sometimes you just know deep down that that's not right and you
02:13:51.92 --> 02:13:55.36 choose your battles I think it's important to choose what battles you stand up more
02:13:56.40 --> 02:14:02.72 whether there are some battles that you should never ever stand down and I swore I would never make
02:14:02.72 --> 02:14:12.32 that mistake again and then find a very relevant today I mean we accept the risks of our occupation
02:14:12.32 --> 02:14:22.40 for the greater good of what it does for society our country our species and it's relevant in
02:14:23.12 --> 02:14:30.96 space exploration in NASA what I've been honored and privileged to take part of and we accept
02:14:30.96 --> 02:14:37.68 the risks of what we are trying to do for the general good what it brings back to humanity
02:14:37.68 --> 02:14:47.52 but I think having that experience to know it's worth cashing in that currency that reputation
02:14:47.52 --> 02:14:51.44 you've built up to speak up one something is up one something is messed up
02:14:53.52 --> 02:15:00.64 to one of the I feel like we could talk about that day for the rest of the I think we could
02:15:00.64 --> 02:15:10.08 talk about August thinking for the rest of the day but all the other things and that's just the first
02:15:07.84 --> 02:15:19.36 chapter of what happened that day as you know we lost markedly on that day those
02:15:21.76 --> 02:15:28.40 lot of what I do today I made a promise to not just those to not just to mark and Ryan but
02:15:28.40 --> 02:15:38.80 I can I can list along listen names of people we've lost since then that we that the void
02:15:38.80 --> 02:15:48.64 created by those warriors that would certainly have done good for this world that I owe it that we
02:15:48.64 --> 02:15:56.48 owe it to them to be a positive mark in this world and that can take many forms for me
02:15:56.48 --> 02:16:02.56 that was why I wanted to be a physician it didn't really matter that it was medicine and it
02:16:02.56 --> 02:16:08.000 was just natural for me because that's what I was involved in to take that level of service to a
02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:17.60 higher calling but taking like trying to become an astronaut is completely consistent with my promise
02:16:17.60 --> 02:16:29.12 to leave the positive impact in this world and that's how I honor the brothers we lost and I
02:16:31.04 --> 02:16:37.60 will never stop until the day I die trying to fill in that void because it's a boy that can never be
02:16:37.60 --> 02:16:47.60 filled in.
02:16:47.60 --> 02:17:11.36 I was walking out of the tactical operations center on a little base on that day and
02:17:11.36 --> 02:17:26.48 I remember I I walked out and I looked over to my right and walked out the door and I looked over to my
02:17:26.48 --> 02:17:52.48 right and I saw you and you were on your knees you were fairly covered in blood
02:17:52.48 --> 02:18:14.48 and you were washing the blood washing the blood out of Ryan's helmet and
02:18:22.48 --> 02:18:47.52 I realized that this was going to take a very personal toll on everybody and
02:18:52.48 --> 02:19:13.20 I didn't know what to say there was no training no one had been killed and I rack before
02:19:13.20 --> 02:19:26.96 for seals we never talked about we never talked about we talked about hey if a guy gets wounded
02:19:26.96 --> 02:19:30.72 if a guy gets killed here's what we're going to do in the next six minutes here's how we're
02:19:30.72 --> 02:19:34.72 going to get a guy extracted here's the cash the evacuation here's the protocol that we're going to go
02:19:34.72 --> 02:19:38.48 through here's the medical procedure going to do to try and save his life these are all things we're
02:19:38.48 --> 02:19:51.28 going to do in the 15 minutes from when someone gets hurt and I had been in the seal teams for
02:19:51.28 --> 02:20:09.68 16 years at that point 15 years and not one time ever in any training scenario did we ever talk
02:20:09.68 --> 02:20:18.40 about okay now what do we do now there's a little protocol around hey here's the casualty
02:20:18.40 --> 02:20:24.96 the casualty officer that's going to go here's the protocol that we follow for notification
02:20:24.96 --> 02:20:31.36 the family all that stuff all the mechanics of it existed and we we did what we were supposed to
02:20:31.36 --> 02:20:38.32 we followed that protocol but the protocol for how do I look at a 21 year old kid that's cleaning
02:20:38.32 --> 02:20:53.76 the blood out of one of his friends helmets there's no protocol for that and what I mean what I
02:20:53.76 --> 02:21:05.92 had to do was because I was still for guy in charge and I had to try and figure out what to do
02:21:05.92 --> 02:21:13.04 there was no one ask no an ask there's no there's no person to say hey what do I do now
02:21:17.28 --> 02:21:27.28 and you know what what I defaulted to which I actually told you guys in the clear
02:21:27.28 --> 02:21:37.36 three days later two days later when I finally could assemble a sentence was go back to work
02:21:38.16 --> 02:21:44.48 was that this is what we came to do we still have a mission we still have soldiers and
02:21:44.48 --> 02:21:49.44 Marines that are out there risking their lives that we absolutely provide safety and security
02:21:49.44 --> 02:22:02.08 for we can deliver those guys home to their families and that's that's what we need to do
02:22:04.16 --> 02:22:05.92 and that's you know that's what we did
02:22:05.92 --> 02:22:27.60 you know sometimes words there are no right words for situations like that but I think
02:22:27.60 --> 02:22:36.56 just being there with the people you love at your side is the most important thing
02:22:37.28 --> 02:22:45.12 to be doing to go back out and work and do the job you came there to do that you signed up to do
02:22:45.12 --> 02:22:59.92 and it's not for I don't mean to be disrespectful with with these words but it's not for
02:23:01.20 --> 02:23:06.16 country or service it's for the person sitting next to you for standing next to you for your
02:23:06.16 --> 02:23:14.32 brother and your sister you do it because you love that person because at least to me and in my
02:23:14.32 --> 02:23:20.96 experience the folks who joined to be seals who did it because they wanted to serve their
02:23:20.96 --> 02:23:27.84 country that was the greatest reason they were there there wasn't a bigger intrinsic reason
02:23:28.64 --> 02:23:36.80 like doing it for the person next to you for the brotherhood for yourself they didn't seem to
02:23:36.80 --> 02:23:51.04 make it through and I'm not sure if I would die for my country but I would and I will die
02:23:51.04 --> 02:24:11.36 for my brother and sister without a doubt and that's just a taste of war we lost two people
02:24:11.36 --> 02:24:21.28 that day there are put tunes companies who have lost half most of their unit you think of you see
02:24:21.28 --> 02:24:30.88 the numbers from World War two or from Vietnam it's astounding we I'm and I am not trying to be
02:24:30.88 --> 02:24:37.52 little the sacrifices our service members have done in this war but I'm just trying to put it in
02:24:37.52 --> 02:24:48.80 context that we had a whole generation of people we asked them to continue fighting despite
02:24:48.80 --> 02:24:56.000 the heavy losses and casualties they suffered on a daily basis that trumped any number we had
02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:03.36 in the post 9-11 wars and they did it
02:25:03.36 --> 02:25:14.24 so being there with your brothers and sisters and continuing that fight that is the best
02:25:14.24 --> 02:25:18.72 remedy for a situation like that
02:25:18.72 --> 02:25:42.24 and obviously the other you know it's real obvious I guess when you look back but
02:25:42.24 --> 02:25:50.48 again this is something that a lot of times we weren't prepared for in the modern seal
02:25:50.48 --> 02:25:57.44 teams you know when I when I was raising the seal teams in the 90s we were preparing for one
02:25:57.44 --> 02:26:04.64 mission if we were lucky we'd do one mission and that mindset kind of got into our heads where
02:26:04.64 --> 02:26:09.84 you're you know you just didn't think about how how you would continue on and yet I mean we stood
02:26:09.84 --> 02:26:17.52 down for like two days and then it was like okay get your gear back on and it's time to go
02:26:19.20 --> 02:26:28.08 even in that same day after Ryan which hit we said get your stuff on get your gear back on
02:26:28.08 --> 02:26:42.08 reload get back out there and I mean it it it pains me to this a day that I wasn't there
02:26:42.08 --> 02:26:48.72 for that assault because I was with Ryan and I am glad that I was by Ryan's side
02:26:48.72 --> 02:27:04.08 but I meant I wasn't there from Mark when he was shot and killed the next time I saw him
02:27:04.08 --> 02:27:09.12 was in the morgue giving hit giving a final kiss to his forehead
02:27:09.12 --> 02:27:22.16 I didn't mean to interrupt well yeah you're exactly right and and so Ryan wounded and
02:27:23.20 --> 02:27:34.000 I mean severely wounded and then yeah you're right it wasn't even a day it was a matter of
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.44 an hour maybe before life called me up and said hey this is what's going on
02:27:43.92 --> 02:27:52.56 and then yeah once Mark was gone then it was a couple days and then okay
02:27:54.88 --> 02:27:59.68 and again the the the the strange thing or
02:27:59.68 --> 02:28:06.40 I guess the thing to contemplate a little bit deeper is you know if you're going on to
02:28:07.04 --> 02:28:13.68 gobble canal like you're gonna fight and you're not gonna have time to think about what just happened
02:28:14.80 --> 02:28:20.56 whereas hey the way it was for us it was like okay well now you're gonna stand down for two days
02:28:20.56 --> 02:28:30.40 you're gonna think about everything you're gonna you're gonna package up your your bro's gear and send it home
02:28:30.40 --> 02:28:37.20 you're gonna you're gonna be thinking about that and then you're gonna get in the same vehicles
02:28:37.20 --> 02:28:40.08 you're gonna roll out and
02:28:40.08 --> 02:28:51.52 and that's what lies you said that's what you do for your brothers that's what you do
02:28:54.16 --> 02:29:00.80 you keep doing your job you know I was thinking about that too when you're talking about shooting
02:29:01.92 --> 02:29:05.92 and you're talking about look you you know you do you know how you get through that part of the course
02:29:05.92 --> 02:29:11.76 you fall the procedures you do your job you check your body position you front side focus how do you complete the
02:29:11.76 --> 02:29:17.12 stocks you you figure out with the dead spaces you follow the protocol that's what you do that's that's
02:29:17.12 --> 02:29:20.88 what you do that's how you move forward you do what you're supposed to do
02:29:20.88 --> 02:29:41.44 and of course it was an over either because because then you know in September we'll ask
02:29:41.44 --> 02:30:02.40 Mike as well so close to being home going home and a million different excuses that you could make
02:30:02.40 --> 02:30:07.92 to not go out and do your job
02:30:20.56 --> 02:30:24.000 and it was a heavy obviously coming home from that deployment
02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:37.84 was I mean first of all there was no you know they do the they do the decompression stops now
02:30:37.84 --> 02:30:42.80 where you stop somewhere and you hang out for a few days and you kind of decompress what we
02:30:42.80 --> 02:30:55.12 didn't do that we got on a plane and we woke you know flew home and woke up and we were back in San Diego
02:30:55.12 --> 02:31:02.48 yeah right we didn't have time to decompress we didn't have the long boat ride over
02:31:02.48 --> 02:31:15.12 the Atlantic to decompress with your buddies around cards around a drink and just talk that's
02:31:15.12 --> 02:31:23.92 what you do right after an op you just hang out with your but with your bros and just you don't
02:31:23.92 --> 02:31:31.92 know your decompressing but that's what you're doing and to be thrust back into civilization normal
02:31:31.92 --> 02:31:39.28 modern civilization that is a hard transition and it is surreal and it can mess people up
02:31:40.40 --> 02:31:47.92 when did you come home do you remember yeah so I came home in October most folks came home
02:31:47.92 --> 02:31:56.16 early October or late September I came home because I was I was reading listening and if you
02:31:56.16 --> 02:32:03.28 remember the rules to read and list you need to be it protects the purposes you need to be in
02:32:03.28 --> 02:32:09.68 country on the first day of the month right so I stayed in extra two or three weeks more after
02:32:09.68 --> 02:32:17.12 the rest of my but tune and gone home yeah that's funny remember I ever wanted to like just
02:32:17.12 --> 02:32:22.32 get a special one all your bros already home just wanted to get home they told you it was still there
02:32:22.32 --> 02:32:27.04 with me yeah Tony was still they were we were rough together and I think we still got another
02:32:27.04 --> 02:32:35.84 opportunity out of it with I think team five yeah had had was coming to really us yeah you
02:32:35.84 --> 02:32:41.28 well you were the last plane home with us I was I think on one of the last planes home
02:32:42.56 --> 02:32:49.44 because I remember um I remember meeting Marcus as he was in the battalion we're leaving us
02:32:49.44 --> 02:33:00.24 and yeah I think I was in the I think in one of the last planes home and then at this point
02:33:01.44 --> 02:33:06.000 it was weird when we got home because like the guys back on the strand had been like reading
02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:12.24 our after actions reports known what we were doing they gone to our guys funerals
02:33:13.60 --> 02:33:17.76 visit our wounded guys in the hospital and I remember when we got home
02:33:17.76 --> 02:33:32.88 this was the decompression plan they had new guys swim pairs of new guys so if for instance
02:33:32.88 --> 02:33:39.76 when we went to the bar they had a they had a new guy to drive you home and a new guy to drive
02:33:39.76 --> 02:33:49.68 your car home that was the decompression plan I remember thinking myself well okay at least
02:33:49.68 --> 02:33:54.24 somebody thought of something and that's what that's what it was it was all right you know we'll
02:33:54.24 --> 02:33:59.60 take care of you guys we know you got some steam to blow off and that's what we did I don't know if
02:33:59.60 --> 02:34:06.48 that was a good plan it doesn't really see back I think the spirit of trying to do the spirit of
02:34:06.48 --> 02:34:12.64 it was good execution was maybe a little yeah just maybe there's something we could have used more
02:34:12.64 --> 02:34:21.44 than a new guy to drive you I remember I was getting in a car and I mean we're look
02:34:23.04 --> 02:34:27.68 there's when you when when when I'll just speak for my own person when I came home from that
02:34:27.68 --> 02:34:35.76 appointed like you you weren't holding a lot back you know it was like no you're dumb no don't do
02:34:35.76 --> 02:34:42.24 that hey we're not doing that it was like we were I was definitely at that point of just calling things
02:34:42.24 --> 02:34:51.04 how they were and that was like you had to I had to re-adapt to say okay you know what I can't just
02:34:51.04 --> 02:35:00.32 just just do that all the time absolutely I I feel like we can talk a long time about
02:35:01.12 --> 02:35:07.68 re-aclimating back to society and how to do that effectively and I think personally that
02:35:07.68 --> 02:35:15.20 that transition is so difficult that it is also the reason why a lot of people have trouble
02:35:15.20 --> 02:35:21.68 read justing back to society because you put that switch on for so long you just don't know
02:35:21.68 --> 02:35:28.16 exactly how to turn it back off and I remember very clearly when I came back it was very raw
02:35:29.12 --> 02:35:41.36 everything was raw and I was a lot more direct and I think the heat and anger my heart had
02:35:41.36 --> 02:35:54.72 just swelled up and I it it took me years to read just re-aclimate get a better understanding of
02:35:54.72 --> 02:36:01.36 what I had been through and what I was feeling to be a productive member of society because
02:36:01.36 --> 02:36:07.92 you can't talk that way you maybe you'll get away talking like that to a patoon of seals
02:36:07.92 --> 02:36:14.56 for the rest of your career but you're going to be very you're in for a surprise for a shock when
02:36:14.56 --> 02:36:20.08 you go back to the real world and you realize that people don't respond in that fashion when you
02:36:20.08 --> 02:36:27.52 talk to them because I mean that's just not how most of society most of humans interact they don't
02:36:27.52 --> 02:36:37.04 interact on that type of level of intensity and rawness so that was huge huge learning for me
02:36:37.04 --> 02:36:46.32 and I'm very thankful that I had the years that in going to college are working in a different
02:36:46.32 --> 02:36:52.40 line of work to really understand that a different human side a different meaning of what I meant to be
02:36:52.40 --> 02:37:02.32 human I was I remember I had conversations with life and death because life and death
02:37:02.32 --> 02:37:07.44 the two-partue commanders you know we were getting asked questions we were getting the people that we're saying
02:37:07.44 --> 02:37:11.68 well should you guys been going on the day or should you guys been working with like we were getting
02:37:11.68 --> 02:37:18.16 all those questions and I had a legitimate sit down with both those guys and I was like listen
02:37:19.20 --> 02:37:23.68 we cannot be emotional about this we cannot respond it came after we went to a meeting
02:37:24.24 --> 02:37:30.16 where it was an officer detailer meeting and we were you know it's sort of plotting out what the
02:37:30.16 --> 02:37:35.60 what an officer career should look like blah blah blah and somehow this so the three of us are
02:37:35.60 --> 02:37:40.000 in the bunch of other officers like all lieutenant's all you know lieutenant's maybe some oh
02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:46.72 force in there and one of the other guys that I knew who's a good guy he he didn't mean anything
02:37:46.72 --> 02:37:53.44 by it but but he said something along the lines of you know when we were saying well it'd be
02:37:53.44 --> 02:37:58.48 good to do this job or that job or whatever and the conversation was going and he said something
02:37:58.48 --> 02:38:03.04 along the lines of well not everyone's going to be as lucky as you guys were because I think you
02:38:03.04 --> 02:38:06.40 know he was just trying to say be good for guys to be able to get another shit and he goes not
02:38:06.40 --> 02:38:14.08 everyone's going to be as lucky as you guys were then and I get what he was saying but like I had to
02:38:14.80 --> 02:38:20.88 I had to you know just detach a little bit because let's face it I mean this was within weeks of
02:38:20.88 --> 02:38:25.84 coming home and you're thinking the last thing in the world you think you are lucky that you just
02:38:25.84 --> 02:38:34.48 buried your freaking guys and and I but you know we all maintained but you know after that I
02:38:34.48 --> 02:38:41.76 I talked to Nathan Seth who as you know Nathan Seth are not exactly the most you know they're
02:38:41.76 --> 02:38:46.24 not real great at hiding their emotions right they're both freaking passionate emotional guys
02:38:46.80 --> 02:38:53.44 and I was like guys we cannot you if we talk about this deployment from emotional perspective all the
02:38:53.44 --> 02:39:00.000 time we're we're not going to be able to communicate properly what we learned and so we have to
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:06.96 take a step back don't get emotional don't get an arguments about this stuff just stay detached
02:39:06.96 --> 02:39:18.64 and and communicate what happened human psychology is everything learning how to be in control of
02:39:18.64 --> 02:39:26.96 your emotions your body language how you craft your words it's probably the most important thing
02:39:26.96 --> 02:39:36.40 you can do as a leader and as a follower and it took me many years to learn this and I'm just kind of
02:39:36.40 --> 02:39:43.04 smiling as you're talking about this I did not learn as a 22 year old kid coming back from the
02:39:43.04 --> 02:39:50.96 deployment I did not learn how to detach myself how to be emotionless because while human emotion
02:39:52.08 --> 02:39:59.04 is what makes us human and is some of the best aspects of what make us human it is all also the
02:39:59.04 --> 02:40:05.28 biggest hindrance to getting stuff done to completing the mission ego is a part of it narcissism
02:40:05.28 --> 02:40:12.56 is a part of it those are human emotions but they're walls and when you bring emotion to the table
02:40:13.84 --> 02:40:19.36 you are mounting defenses that make it hard to get to the core of your argument of what your
02:40:19.36 --> 02:40:28.24 vision is and I've got countless stories where I failed and then endeavor but have learned
02:40:28.24 --> 02:40:34.64 through experience and through just watching other people observing making mistakes
02:40:34.64 --> 02:40:41.60 being in the seal teams of learning to find tune that emotional and social intelligence
02:40:42.80 --> 02:40:50.64 to know the human psychology of the person you're talking to of how to disarm their defenses
02:40:50.64 --> 02:41:00.32 if they are emotional or disagree with you because people have common I friendly believe that
02:41:00.32 --> 02:41:06.64 all people want good things we just disagree on how to get from point A to point B and that's where
02:41:06.64 --> 02:41:12.000 we mount our defenses and lose sight of the big picture but if you can take a step back
02:41:12.80 --> 02:41:19.20 remove your ego and emotion from the picture and find common ground that's where you can
02:41:20.72 --> 02:41:27.52 influence and share your vision to complete your objective and that's that's applicable in
02:41:27.52 --> 02:41:32.48 everything we do let's applicable in combat to political and pool in business in medicine
02:41:33.28 --> 02:41:40.48 in what I do as a national and NASA is trying to share that vision trying to get that buy in
02:41:41.44 --> 02:41:45.60 and then all starts with understanding the human condition
02:41:46.96 --> 02:41:49.76 I've got a funny story that I always remember
02:41:49.76 --> 02:41:58.56 and I'm embarrassed about it and I wish if I ever meet this person again I would like to say
02:41:59.20 --> 02:42:03.12 I would like to apologize there are a lot of people I would like to apologize and this is one of them
02:42:04.48 --> 02:42:09.76 I was home this is at post deployment and I was playing one of the many call of duty video games
02:42:10.48 --> 02:42:15.60 and this is my brother's girlfriend and she saw me playing this video game and I'm just
02:42:15.60 --> 02:42:20.000 getting into it and she says I don't understand war such a waste of life
02:42:21.84 --> 02:42:31.44 and there was something inside of me that just I'm embarrassed to say but I snapped
02:42:32.40 --> 02:42:42.40 and I had I was stern I wasn't like I wasn't unprofessional on cussing her out but I was like
02:42:42.40 --> 02:42:48.32 that like you don't know what you're talking about how dare you say like I think having a pretty
02:42:52.88 --> 02:42:58.32 not a responsible way of responding back to that it was born out of emotion because
02:42:58.96 --> 02:43:04.96 I was hurt because I took that as an attack against friends that I had just recently lost
02:43:04.96 --> 02:43:15.76 and this young woman who had no maliciousness behind her comment and was absolutely surprised
02:43:15.76 --> 02:43:25.84 with my reaction and was apologetic but I could have been more effective just slowing down
02:43:25.84 --> 02:43:31.52 removing actually using the intrinsic emotion I was having as a as a tell
02:43:31.52 --> 02:43:38.48 right because if you can be a little more control and understanding of your own emotions it can tell
02:43:38.48 --> 02:43:45.68 you it can give you hints as to what is going on and how to properly respond and craft your
02:43:45.68 --> 02:43:55.36 words to get your message across I could have with my body language with my tone I could have
02:43:55.36 --> 02:44:02.64 said something different to to let her know how I understand the spirit of her comment but how that
02:44:02.64 --> 02:44:08.16 comes across to veterans and how she can be better informed of the future to be more careful
02:44:08.16 --> 02:44:14.96 with her words and not have snapped back at her and to this day I told my brother and he's like
02:44:14.96 --> 02:44:19.76 no it's not a big deal at all she's like she never you know she probably wouldn't even remember
02:44:19.76 --> 02:44:26.08 it but I still to this day feel bad and that's just one of many examples where I let human
02:44:26.08 --> 02:44:35.28 emotion get in the way and I can for me my childhood was a phase of learning the teams were
02:44:35.28 --> 02:44:42.32 a phase of learning but post teams there was a lot of learning how to be a human that made
02:44:42.32 --> 02:44:52.24 me suitable to be a candidate for our space exploration program and I there's no way I would
02:44:52.24 --> 02:44:58.16 be in the situation have the honor and privilege I do now if it wasn't for all of those experiences
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:06.72 you get home from that deployment and this again it's the same the same idea is guess what
02:45:06.72 --> 02:45:10.64 you're going to do now you're going to go another tune you're going to get do another work
02:45:10.64 --> 02:45:15.68 up you're going to pull him in again was there you just that's just how and you're just going to
02:45:15.68 --> 02:45:28.80 execute that yeah I think it's a bit different this time ago around I think I already said it earlier
02:45:28.80 --> 02:45:36.48 but there's a special name for what up for seals like me because I only did two tours to deploy
02:45:36.48 --> 02:45:41.84 minutes which for people who don't know in the grand scheme of things it's nothing compared to the
02:45:41.84 --> 02:45:48.32 experience of a lot of seals a lot of soldiers marines who have done multiple tours and but the first
02:45:48.32 --> 02:45:56.96 one we had agreed we had a lot of heavy sustained combat experience and being able to do to take
02:45:56.96 --> 02:46:03.52 those experiences forward this time not as a new guy having new seals and our pertune and being able
02:46:03.52 --> 02:46:14.56 to mentor them was a privilege and an honor so it was I remember feeling drastically different
02:46:15.20 --> 02:46:20.32 the second time through and still of course learning every single day but also knowing that you
02:46:20.32 --> 02:46:28.48 serve as a role model and everything you do and say and act to believe it or not younger people because
02:46:28.48 --> 02:46:38.56 I've all those pretty young but even more junior and younger seals and the second puttune
02:46:38.56 --> 02:46:45.20 work up going through that again and deploying again and while the second time around it was a
02:46:45.20 --> 02:46:54.80 little different there was this there was a stint under Seth where we had some pretty sustained combat
02:46:54.80 --> 02:47:02.96 yeah well the funny thing was when Seth was considering what he was going to do next and
02:47:04.64 --> 02:47:09.04 you know he was going to go to school maybe get out always all these different options that he had in
02:47:09.04 --> 02:47:17.44 his head and you know I talked to him and I was like hey man first of all if you don't if you don't
02:47:17.44 --> 02:47:22.88 take over the Sask unit someone else is and the only person that you take it over should be someone
02:47:22.88 --> 02:47:27.60 experienced someone that will take care of these guys that deserve to have someone to take care of them
02:47:29.52 --> 02:47:34.48 and you know he's listening to me and finally just stands up and starts walking down and I'm like
02:47:34.48 --> 02:47:37.68 where are you going he's like I'm going to talk to the excel and I was like go to get a tell him I said
02:47:37.68 --> 02:47:43.36 I'm going to tell him I'm taking over this task unit and I was like Roger that but one of the other
02:47:43.36 --> 02:47:50.88 things now as you guys were going through work up and you know there's all kinds of this this the
02:47:50.88 --> 02:47:55.76 there's all the political things going on there's all the little backstabbing and all this
02:47:55.76 --> 02:48:01.60 crops you know just normal kind of political crap that goes on and you don't want it to go on
02:48:01.60 --> 02:48:10.32 to the teams but it does and so that stuff's going on and Seth you know Seth's he was real prone
02:48:10.32 --> 02:48:15.60 to getting frustrated by that stuff you know he could freak out about something and so finally you know
02:48:15.60 --> 02:48:22.08 what one day he's out this all the capability they're doing and whatever and I said bro just calm
02:48:22.08 --> 02:48:26.64 down going to employment nothing's going on go over there work out for six months you know get
02:48:26.64 --> 02:48:33.84 strong and then come home and then chill out you know go to sure duty whatever so he's like
02:48:33.84 --> 02:48:38.88 fine you know and so he goes on to point it just like you all did with the attitude of like okay
02:48:38.88 --> 02:48:44.08 cool you know nothing's going on we're going to go to a place with a good gym will train some
02:48:44.08 --> 02:48:52.80 Iraqi soldiers and we will you know get big and then sure enough as fate would have it you guys roll in
02:48:52.80 --> 02:48:59.52 and pretty quickly after you guys roll in the I don't know if you know this side of the story
02:48:59.52 --> 02:49:03.76 but the conventional some of the conventional commanders that were there when task unit bruiser was there
02:49:04.64 --> 02:49:10.40 found out that some of the guys from task unit bruiser were back in country and put out a very
02:49:10.40 --> 02:49:18.80 specific request for forces that spelled out exactly who they wanted and that's that's why
02:49:19.44 --> 02:49:28.08 you guys ended up getting the call for supporting the efforts inside of solder city which was
02:49:28.08 --> 02:49:36.96 a freaking disaster at the time yeah it was none of where of that it was um and we found ourselves in
02:49:36.96 --> 02:49:48.000 an in a situation where we had the opportunity the privilege to have an impact on operations and
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:56.88 support our brothers and sisters in the army and I remember also Mike Sureli being there and
02:49:56.88 --> 02:50:06.16 I went to Buds with Mike and it was an honor to serve under his leadership I admired Mike
02:50:06.16 --> 02:50:14.64 long ago from Buds being an 18 year old kid and obviously you know Mike he was a former roper
02:50:15.20 --> 02:50:26.80 former for um Marine Force Recon staff sergeant so you know we in Buds we were enamored with his
02:50:26.80 --> 02:50:36.80 experience but also his ability to talk respectfully and speak the language to the other officers and
02:50:36.80 --> 02:50:44.56 the instructors but also speak to the level of the lowest in listed and that's a skill that's hard
02:50:44.56 --> 02:50:50.72 to learn and definitely I was unaware at the time but also making observations and taking
02:50:50.72 --> 02:51:03.04 unconscious notes to incorporate in my own quest to learn how to share my vision and how to be
02:51:03.04 --> 02:51:11.68 a follower and how to be a leader later on in my life what do you remember about um that first
02:51:11.68 --> 02:51:21.92 op into solder city was good times huh yeah I would I would I would make a disc
02:51:21.92 --> 02:51:29.52 plant so I served as one of the appointment and the navigators and I had to confess that I did not
02:51:29.52 --> 02:51:42.80 have a good I did not perform well especially on that first op and it was you know I'd take
02:51:42.80 --> 02:51:48.08 accountability for that and it's not that I ever had to talk with Seth or anything but I don't
02:51:48.08 --> 02:51:53.28 I've never actually had this conversation with anyone but I know that first op I felt like I failed
02:51:53.92 --> 02:51:56.88 in a lot of ways this is the first time I'm actually publicly talking about it
02:51:56.88 --> 02:52:07.44 it was a new area we had made this force combined from operators from different
02:52:07.44 --> 02:52:12.96 platoons and different teams we and there were never worked together and in theory you should
02:52:12.96 --> 02:52:16.72 be that shouldn't be a problem right because we had the same standard operating procedures everyone
02:52:16.72 --> 02:52:22.48 knows how to do an I had an appeal left peel rights center peel you know respond moving
02:52:22.48 --> 02:52:29.84 cover and move everyone knows the basics but they did throw a little bit of a wrench just
02:52:29.84 --> 02:52:41.60 working with operators you hadn't yet worked with and I know for me that it was another I should
02:52:41.60 --> 02:52:48.48 have known better especially having been through oh six more body that the mental preparation
02:52:48.48 --> 02:52:54.56 required and I think I talked to you but for me that preparation was getting in the mind said that
02:52:54.56 --> 02:53:02.96 I would not come home and for that first op and sawter city I was I don't I was not there yet
02:53:04.16 --> 02:53:12.96 and I was the navigator and let us in actually that was we were inserted by the army
02:53:12.96 --> 02:53:20.88 some local armor in the area and we were trying to get to our target site and we got
02:53:20.88 --> 02:53:30.000 compromised they were lookouts there and I missed my opportunity to engage those lookouts
02:53:30.96 --> 02:53:40.08 and we eventually got we got attacked from the rooftops there were RPGs there were sustained
02:53:40.08 --> 02:53:46.72 automatic fire and we had a call in for you know you were for help to get out of that area
02:53:46.72 --> 02:53:56.88 so it was a welcome back into the fray of things and I if I talked to other people I don't
02:53:56.88 --> 02:54:02.08 know I don't think they would probably call me on say you did bad job on that but I think personally
02:54:02.08 --> 02:54:11.68 I feel I've carried that with me just prompts and like you're getting getting locked on and
02:54:11.68 --> 02:54:18.48 getting back on track so that's specifically the first op yeah and the reason I specifically asked
02:54:18.48 --> 02:54:24.56 you about the first op is because after the first op which I know was was was not a good
02:54:24.56 --> 02:54:33.60 operation because Seth called me and was like horrified at the way the whole thing went down he
02:54:33.60 --> 02:54:38.96 of course said he totally screwed it up and he needed to reset and Mike's really says the same
02:54:38.96 --> 02:54:44.72 exact thing you know he made mistakes and he they didn't do the right so it's like everybody
02:54:46.32 --> 02:54:54.08 everybody that I know personally was all like they felt awful about that first operation
02:54:54.08 --> 02:55:00.48 and it was only by the grace of God that it wasn't like a mass casualty scenario
02:55:03.52 --> 02:55:10.88 I mean it's funny I have never had this conversation with Mike or the Seth anyone else
02:55:12.40 --> 02:55:17.28 it's kind of funny you saying these things like we all are saying the same things and trying
02:55:17.28 --> 02:55:24.32 to take accountability for how that went you know it was eye opening and I mean they brought it
02:55:24.32 --> 02:55:34.24 the enemy brought it and we were in for a rude awakening but in a lot of ways it helped us
02:55:35.04 --> 02:55:42.000 for the future ops because we had good successful ops that made an impact later on it's just that
02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:49.52 first one was I don't know here right there were there were RPGs that were really close we
02:55:51.92 --> 02:56:02.64 and by the grace of God we had our army brothers there to support us really so I can't give enough
02:56:02.64 --> 02:56:13.44 props to to guys to our brothers like that yeah it's one of those you know and I'm sure
02:56:13.44 --> 02:56:18.48 Mike and I will go into a bigger debrief at some point on this from his perspective I wish
02:56:18.48 --> 02:56:25.28 Seth I wish I would hit record you know whenever he called me years ago on a on a secure
02:56:25.28 --> 02:56:30.16 line to kind of debrief me but what I think is awesome and definitely get this from Mike and
02:56:30.16 --> 02:56:39.44 which is like you guys could have walked out of that walked off that operation you know completed
02:56:39.44 --> 02:56:45.92 that mission and gone into freaking hiding like just been like this is not going to work this is
02:56:45.92 --> 02:56:52.64 we're we're not ready for this all those things but I think it's a great example of okay
02:56:54.56 --> 02:56:58.64 stand down for 72 hours we got to do some rehearsals we got to do some drills we got to get our
02:56:58.64 --> 02:57:07.60 shit together and then we'll do this properly and so often people take a hit you know they
02:57:07.60 --> 02:57:12.72 they make a mistake and their attitude is oh no I'm not capable doing this see I'm wrong I'm a
02:57:12.72 --> 02:57:18.24 disaster instead of instead of assessing it going okay here's the mistake you got made here's the
02:57:18.24 --> 02:57:21.92 mistakes that got made here's the things we need to change here's the rehearsal we need to do here's
02:57:21.92 --> 02:57:27.04 the planning we need to put into place you do an assessment and like you just said you learn from your
02:57:27.04 --> 02:57:32.24 mistakes and you make adjustments I mean it's the same thing with the blue on blue we had arriving in
02:57:32.24 --> 02:57:40.88 Ramadhi it's like okay look we got away without one relatively light relatively light I mean
02:57:41.52 --> 02:57:47.20 we we hey on Iraqi soldier was killed that was awful a couple Iraqi soldiers were wounded
02:57:47.76 --> 02:57:54.16 we had one guy get fragged in the face but compared to what could have happened we got off light
02:57:54.16 --> 02:57:58.48 and same thing we didn't say well there's two things we didn't do we didn't say well that wasn't our
02:57:58.48 --> 02:58:04.08 fault and that you know it was like no this is my fault and here's what we're gonna do to fix it
02:58:04.08 --> 02:58:10.000 and that's the same attitude that you guys had that first operation at Sander City which was okay
02:58:11.12 --> 02:58:16.80 we made mistakes there are fault we're gonna fix them and we're gonna go back and get after it
02:58:16.80 --> 02:58:26.08 direct parallels with that blue on blue incident we had compared to the first off we had
02:58:26.08 --> 02:58:32.72 in Tatar City and I remember you know it was a four man element with some Iraqis you know
02:58:32.72 --> 02:58:40.000 I don't want to say names but I was with that forward recon element and just the Swiss cheese
02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:49.84 model Murphy's law it went bad quick and like you said someone got shot in the face and
02:58:51.04 --> 02:58:59.84 alright Iraqi died and someone was fragged and I played a role in that that was the first
02:58:59.84 --> 02:59:08.000 firefight I caught in and it was one of the worst ones and now that I have had a little bit more
02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:14.16 experience to kind of understand that when you're receiving sustained 50-count fire in multiple
02:59:14.72 --> 02:59:20.16 automatic weapons fire you're probably not fighting the enemy you think you're fighting and that was
02:59:20.16 --> 02:59:26.48 because we were fighting greens and a whole company by rackies who were painting us down and it's amazing
02:59:26.48 --> 02:59:37.68 that we didn't lose anyone on that and I by the grace I threw a couple of racks immediately
02:59:37.68 --> 02:59:43.12 that was one of my first reactions and thankfully I did not cook those fracks for those who don't know
02:59:43.12 --> 02:59:54.24 cooking a frag means you pulled the ring and there's a little bit of time you know
02:59:54.24 --> 03:00:02.96 what's the latest you five seconds allegedly yeah and you hold it release and cook it you
03:00:02.96 --> 03:00:07.44 know count one with thousand two and thousand three and the idea is that when you throw it there's not enough time
03:00:07.44 --> 03:00:11.60 for the person you're throwing it to pick it up and throw it back at you right thankfully I did not
03:00:11.60 --> 03:00:17.68 cook those grenades and I talked to some of the marine angle code that was on the ground there and they said
03:00:17.68 --> 03:00:24.72 my frag just rolled by and thankfully he had enough time to get out of the way and that's me that's on me
03:00:24.72 --> 03:00:34.96 it's and I remember distinctly after that event you came in we were in the platoon hot
03:00:34.96 --> 03:00:41.76 in he asked us like you're going around like who's fault is this and like I think Jeremy
03:00:41.76 --> 03:00:47.44 raised his hands like it's my fault and I don't know it's like my fault and you really know
03:00:47.44 --> 03:00:58.32 it's my fault and you went on to talk about why and you assumed responsibility and I didn't know
03:00:58.32 --> 03:01:03.52 what at the time being just a young kid watching all this taken it all in but it had a formative
03:01:03.52 --> 03:01:12.80 impact on me of assuming command and responsibility when you are the leader because the book stops with you
03:01:12.80 --> 03:01:25.44 and just taking unconscious notes about that interaction but that had a huge formative
03:01:26.24 --> 03:01:30.64 that was a very formative experience for me and it parallels exactly what we were just talking
03:01:30.64 --> 03:01:38.64 about with that first op and solder city I would love to talk to Mike about it one day the next time I see
03:01:38.64 --> 03:01:45.52 him yeah what could you guys both in here we'll do a full full debrief so that that those operations
03:01:45.52 --> 03:01:53.36 in solder city though man after that so just a couple things solder city had been a total disaster
03:01:54.000 --> 03:02:01.60 four years so that was 2008 it been a disaster since 2003 the enemy was in control of that area
03:02:01.60 --> 03:02:07.68 the entire time the army finally said they're gonna do something about it the army started building a wall
03:02:08.96 --> 03:02:16.64 the enemy for roachiously attacked it was devastating and you guys rolled in there after the first
03:02:16.64 --> 03:02:22.40 op obviously things went bad and and and and and then you guys got in your rhythm you figured out
03:02:22.40 --> 03:02:30.40 you corrected your mistakes and you guys started executing these missions in support of the army
03:02:30.40 --> 03:02:39.52 and started killing a lot of bad guys and I I want to say it was about six weeks after about six
03:02:39.52 --> 03:02:46.24 weeks the enemy surrendered for all practical purposes the people that were leading the insurgents
03:02:46.96 --> 03:02:53.68 inside that area said okay yeah yeah we're done we're done so a problem that had been a problem for five years
03:02:53.68 --> 03:03:03.36 was over in about six weeks and again I'm I'm breezing through that because you guys did some
03:03:03.36 --> 03:03:09.84 harling missions in there and took a lot of risk to go in there and make that happen but it was my
03:03:09.84 --> 03:03:20.96 point is that it was risky yes but very effective in in subdoing a previously just savage enemy that
03:03:20.96 --> 03:03:30.000 did not care I don't know if too many things in this life that are good things that are without risk
03:03:30.96 --> 03:03:40.32 and that goes to every facet of life of business a combat of space exploration all good things
03:03:40.32 --> 03:03:47.28 have a lot of risk and a lot of hard work to get there and certainly combat operations there were no
03:03:47.28 --> 03:03:56.40 different now at what point did you start thinking about you know going to become a doctor
03:03:57.28 --> 03:04:04.96 that was in remoney so when you did your initial application it was between
03:04:05.84 --> 03:04:11.52 deployments is that right yes so the story that I mentioned earlier of me being like I don't
03:04:11.52 --> 03:04:15.04 know why you don't want to be a doctor it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard being a team
03:04:15.04 --> 03:04:22.48 guys the best thing in the world why would you trade in an M60 for a scalpel so we actually had
03:04:22.48 --> 03:04:29.28 that conversation in between we did I remember very well I just a giant I don't know why you want
03:04:29.28 --> 03:04:36.000 to do this but I will support you you know and you had my back like I would never want to do this
03:04:36.56 --> 03:04:40.80 but good on you for the one and a do is and I'll support you in every way and I mean that letter you
03:04:40.80 --> 03:04:46.96 read at the start of this brought back some memories I the very powerful words and like
03:04:47.68 --> 03:04:56.96 undeserving kind words I had not heard that in many years when did you find out you got picked up
03:04:56.96 --> 03:05:03.68 was that before deployment that was during I think during deployment so I decided I was going to go
03:05:03.68 --> 03:05:08.000 into stay 21 that for those who don't know that's the elicit to officer commissioning program
03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:12.64 so that I can go to medical school and I knew I wanted to do it after coming out of a
03:05:12.64 --> 03:05:23.36 Romadi but I thought it was poor form and really I could embarrass to leave my
03:05:23.36 --> 03:05:29.12 petune after especially at the one one deployment and what kind of what is that I
03:05:29.12 --> 03:05:37.04 already feel bad enough that I've only done two deployments and I am aware that I am a
03:05:37.04 --> 03:05:44.80 representative of the seal teams in what I do now which unfortunately I say unfortunately because
03:05:46.16 --> 03:05:54.08 I don't appreciate the the spotlight I was of what I have to do as a national
03:05:54.08 --> 03:06:01.28 not but I am a representative of the teams and to me that's kind of crazy like I do not
03:06:01.28 --> 03:06:08.000 deserve to be a representative of the teams I'm a two pump jump you want me to be representative
03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:14.08 of the teams and I do it with honor and seriousness and I will do I will never do anything to
03:06:14.08 --> 03:06:22.56 disgrace the teams I hold and covet that honor more than anything and I will defend it
03:06:23.20 --> 03:06:30.24 at all costs but I just talking just being here it's just like people will see it and
03:06:30.24 --> 03:06:37.60 see me as a representative and it's humbling in many ways and it I take it seriously
03:06:38.72 --> 03:06:43.60 so I wanted to at least get two deployments and because I felt like it's like the least
03:06:43.60 --> 03:06:47.28 respectable amount of work you should do as a team guys at least two deployments
03:06:48.64 --> 03:06:52.24 so yeah that the decision was made like all right I'll put in this pack I'll time this package
03:06:52.24 --> 03:06:56.88 in so that I'm getting a decision yesterday as I'm coming off of the signal deployment
03:06:56.88 --> 03:07:01.68 and that's what happened I found out and then maybe just before we left or maybe during
03:07:01.68 --> 03:07:09.36 deployment that I was accepted into the program and so you come home from that deployment
03:07:10.08 --> 03:07:13.44 you had you guys had a little bit of time to decompress during that deployment
03:07:13.44 --> 03:07:17.44 because the solder city fighting was in the beginning of the deployment relatively close
03:07:17.44 --> 03:07:23.52 you guys got done and and then it was you know kind of what I said earlier was hey back to some
03:07:23.52 --> 03:07:31.76 outstations relatively mellow compared to either a, Romadi or b, solder city
03:07:32.64 --> 03:07:37.12 then I mean not to dismiss what the work we did and the work that other people did but if
03:07:37.12 --> 03:07:43.04 the combat operations intensity was night and day difference I mean we were working at an
03:07:43.04 --> 03:07:49.20 up-house in Rupa and doing a lot of long range reconnaissance missions on side by side which are basically
03:07:49.20 --> 03:07:56.48 high powered tactical go-carts going hundreds of miles and just traversing the desert in
03:07:56.48 --> 03:08:05.52 these getting paid to do it but it was definitely different because I fired my rifle almost
03:08:05.52 --> 03:08:13.28 every single operation in Romadi I could probably count on one hand like the times that didn't
03:08:13.28 --> 03:08:20.24 like when there was a mission where I didn't fire all the same within solder city every
03:08:20.24 --> 03:08:23.36 I don't feel there was a single lot operation we did where I didn't fire my rifle
03:08:25.52 --> 03:08:30.64 but in Rupa it afterwards I didn't I don't think I fired it once except on the range
03:08:30.64 --> 03:08:35.04 so I make sure it's said it didn't so it's just just a different contrast you know people
03:08:35.04 --> 03:08:39.20 had different experiences based on where they are yeah and there's different missions there's
03:08:39.20 --> 03:08:43.52 different things that people have to do and I say this you know I'll have guys come up to me and say
03:08:43.52 --> 03:08:48.56 you know I was in the I was in the Marine Corps from you know 1994 to 1998 and I never did anything
03:08:48.56 --> 03:08:52.48 and I feel guilty and I'm like hey you did what the country needed you to do you did what America
03:08:52.48 --> 03:08:59.36 needed you to do that's what you did and so you get assigned different missions in any unit and you
03:08:59.36 --> 03:09:04.48 do what you're assigned to do you do to the best of your ability and you know in this case it's a
03:09:04.48 --> 03:09:10.64 little bit of a nice little decompression riding around the desert in ATVs with relatively low
03:09:10.64 --> 03:09:18.88 threat you know and then you come home from that deployment and now now it's time to go to college
03:09:18.88 --> 03:09:28.32 how will do you at this point? see so this is 2000 and eight so I do a public math here
03:09:28.32 --> 03:09:39.52 so did me to put you out in the spot there rock and scientist I was at 24 so you're 24 years old yeah
03:09:39.52 --> 03:09:46.08 I went to college and you went to University of San Diego I went to University of San Diego I was a 28 year old
03:09:46.08 --> 03:09:54.24 no I was a 30 year old completely military institutionalized grown man with no
03:09:54.24 --> 03:10:01.84 like ability to fit in with civilians and I showed off the college and so it was awesome
03:10:04.16 --> 03:10:10.24 and and what what did you major math and did you know at this point you want to kick ass get
03:10:10.24 --> 03:10:18.72 great grades and get into a really good medical school yes that was the plan to I so the program I was
03:10:18.72 --> 03:10:25.68 accepted the seamen animal program was specifically to go to medicine so and the Navy does they
03:10:25.68 --> 03:10:29.20 think a huge gamble because they're accepting you for this program putting a lot of money in you
03:10:29.76 --> 03:10:35.28 and you're not even accepted to college art to college or medical school so they're hoping that you
03:10:35.28 --> 03:10:40.80 will do well enough in college to be accepted to medical school and if it was the same as you you
03:10:40.80 --> 03:10:46.08 only have three years to do an undergraduate degree so you get squash a four year degree in three
03:10:46.08 --> 03:10:52.48 years and for me I also had to get the prerequisites to go to medical school so that was you know full
03:10:52.48 --> 03:11:00.24 time status working summer school working winter doing winter classes you have to go to ROTC I did
03:11:00.88 --> 03:11:06.48 and I also gave up parking tickets to pay for tuition you're one of those guys I just want
03:11:06.48 --> 03:11:12.96 you know the world finally loses respect for Johnny Kim in some way you know what I
03:11:12.96 --> 03:11:21.52 um it was a humbling job on it I think it was good for my soul so ROTC can be hard for former
03:11:21.52 --> 03:11:29.28 elicit because you you you you might be a battle hard and better and no one care and people care
03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:36.48 you have to suck in take that humble pill and realize that you were just another midshyman with the other
03:11:36.48 --> 03:11:42.88 18 19 year old kids and for some people it's hard to do that right because you had to suck in your
03:11:42.88 --> 03:11:49.76 pride take that humble pill and just follow and do these things that are I don't want to say dumb but
03:11:50.72 --> 03:11:58.96 kind of well they're aimed at young inexperienced untrained off-circuited it's that have no
03:11:59.52 --> 03:12:03.52 that have no experience in the military that's who they're aimed at yes they're not aimed at
03:12:03.52 --> 03:12:08.80 guys that have been in the teams on two combat deployments responsible for all kinds of stuff
03:12:09.92 --> 03:12:18.000 they're not aimed at you and so when they hit you they sting but you let them but in that respect
03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:25.76 it is an opportunity to exercise humility and to be able to suck in your pride because that goes
03:12:25.76 --> 03:12:31.36 that is in the same spirit of when someone says or does something to you that gets you emotional
03:12:31.36 --> 03:12:40.000 and you having the mental fortitude to step back put your own emotions aside to get to communicate
03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:46.72 to the person to find common ground in the same way that's how I saw that opportunity to suck in
03:12:47.36 --> 03:12:53.20 my to get that practice at humility and I didn't I wasn't always good at it you know because sometimes
03:12:53.20 --> 03:12:59.20 you're fed up like mustering a 0 500 when the muster is really like 0 700 like why am I here
03:12:59.20 --> 03:13:05.28 for 2 hours because you know maybe the squallie to put 15 minutes of grace time before like the
03:13:05.28 --> 03:13:11.60 company commander before the fake you know like rotsy leader or whatever and then eventually
03:13:11.60 --> 03:13:15.04 works out there you're like 2 hours before you're there standing there 2 hours of attention before
03:13:15.04 --> 03:13:19.92 you need to be there you know like little things like that and for some especially I saw some
03:13:19.92 --> 03:13:29.04 former enlisted having a really hard time keeping their thoughts to themselves team guys are even worse
03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:38.48 yes so it is an exercise in humility and giving parking tickets was the same way because
03:13:39.52 --> 03:13:46.000 the stay 21 was very generous but it only gives 10,000 of tuition but it gives you time you're
03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:51.20 I'm not trying to dismiss the benefits of the program it was I'm very grateful for that but I had to
03:13:51.20 --> 03:13:58.24 make up an extra $20,000 and the university of San Diego was kind enough to offer me a job hey you
03:13:58.24 --> 03:14:04.08 give up parking tickets for eight hours a week and we will cover the rest so I give up parking tickets and
03:14:06.08 --> 03:14:10.24 some may see that like oh wow you went from doing these combat operations to give it in combat
03:14:10.24 --> 03:14:15.36 to give in parking tickets like well for me it was an exercise in humility and just there's
03:14:16.40 --> 03:14:20.96 you should never think you're too good to do a job and I think you should be like that and everything
03:14:20.96 --> 03:14:29.36 you do be for ever new guy is what I try to emulate and I don't mean as in you shouldn't step up to the
03:14:29.36 --> 03:14:35.92 role and be a leader and delicate appropriately but never think that you are above taking out the trash or
03:14:35.92 --> 03:14:43.28 that you're above not respecting the secretary or the lowest junior and listed right I mean that's
03:14:44.24 --> 03:14:48.40 I was there you were there and we were both E-wands you're the bottom of the bottom
03:14:48.40 --> 03:14:56.72 by the food chain, mop and floors taking out the trash and I remember what Tony, Tony afraid
03:14:56.72 --> 03:15:00.88 he said to me when I first showed up he was like never think you're too good to take out the trash
03:15:00.88 --> 03:15:07.52 now I take that to the heart like to this day never too good to do those jobs because
03:15:08.08 --> 03:15:14.96 the moment you start to think you're better than anyone else you have you have poisoned yourself
03:15:14.96 --> 03:15:22.64 you were on the dark path so given out parking tickets was well I'm thankful I got to give
03:15:22.64 --> 03:15:29.68 about parking tickets to really nice cars and universities and we married yet I got married
03:15:30.64 --> 03:15:36.64 during a while in my college and I had my first child my wife and I had our first child
03:15:37.52 --> 03:15:45.52 during university in the year then when do you start applying for med school
03:15:45.52 --> 03:15:52.000 so I applied between second and third year of the university in the summertime
03:15:53.68 --> 03:15:58.24 did you think you'd where do you apply everywhere I applied yeah every I think applied
03:15:58.24 --> 03:16:04.32 like 10 to 15 schools I applied to some really nice schools and you know I told you earlier
03:16:04.32 --> 03:16:09.12 that all my father wanted me to do was go to Harvard medical school and that's not the reason
03:16:09.12 --> 03:16:12.64 at least like at least I tell myself that's not the reason why I did it and maybe it
03:16:12.64 --> 03:16:15.76 is maybe some psychologists listening to this like oh that's totally why you went there
03:16:17.44 --> 03:16:26.72 but for and for me it was I had it was very impactful having friends
03:16:27.52 --> 03:16:34.16 Ryan Mike Mark JT I could go on of the people who have sacrificed
03:16:35.28 --> 03:16:40.40 and were much braver than I could ever be and that does a couple things to you it
03:16:40.40 --> 03:16:45.20 it humbles you for life I think if you remember that right knowing that no matter what you do
03:16:45.20 --> 03:16:49.52 in this lifetime it will never be enough and not that it's comparison but that pursuit
03:16:50.80 --> 03:16:57.28 is important but it made me want to fill in that void to make up for the good they would have
03:16:57.28 --> 03:17:02.56 done and that's how a lot of us honor our friends it's certainly how I honor my friends
03:17:04.08 --> 03:17:10.32 and for me that's being as impactful as possible to this world it doesn't matter what
03:17:10.32 --> 03:17:15.20 that is it could be in the form of serving as a team guy or serving as a physician
03:17:15.92 --> 03:17:22.80 or what my path is taking me to now as serving as a nationalat I wanted to be impactful
03:17:23.60 --> 03:17:31.76 and to me going to Harvard was giving me a better a bigger platform to be impactful it wasn't
03:17:31.76 --> 03:17:36.000 the name it wasn't the brand it wasn't the education you be fooling yourself to think that
03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:40.56 going to Harvard is going to make you a better doctor that's not true at all you would be just as
03:17:40.56 --> 03:17:46.72 good of a doctor anywhere you go to in this country but it was having a platform to be able to
03:17:47.84 --> 03:17:55.12 affect positive change that's why I wanted to go to an institution like John Hopkins or
03:17:55.12 --> 03:18:05.68 Harvard really and for me that transition the years of university San Diego and the early years of
03:18:05.68 --> 03:18:09.28 medical school or the hardest sometimes it's hard it's weird to say but some of the hardest
03:18:09.28 --> 03:18:16.16 years of my life because it was different I couldn't grind through it by just hitting harder
03:18:16.16 --> 03:18:21.12 with the way this is going from university San Diego to Harvard or just going from the team
03:18:21.12 --> 03:18:25.04 so you're just going okay at transition it was some of the hardest years of my life because
03:18:26.24 --> 03:18:30.08 it's not like you could just push through like you can in some of the things you do in
03:18:30.08 --> 03:18:36.16 the bloods or in teams and the bloods is a challenge but as you and I know training is nothing
03:18:36.16 --> 03:18:40.88 compared to war but you think training is hard you think how weak is hard it's hard right
03:18:41.60 --> 03:18:46.88 until you get hit in the face in a real combat operation and then you realize oh
03:18:48.08 --> 03:18:53.20 I've reset my benchmark for what is hard or what is painful or what is suffering and
03:18:53.20 --> 03:19:01.44 even having that benchmark going into transitioning to civilian life it was hard for me
03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:07.04 I was trying to fit in four year degree in three years trying to do really well because I knew
03:19:07.04 --> 03:19:12.16 I had a good grades to be considered for a school like Harvard I had my first child
03:19:13.60 --> 03:19:19.68 I was working part time but probably the worst of it was I was not right
03:19:19.68 --> 03:19:31.68 in the head with my decompression with post war I took a lot of that anger and hatred my
03:19:31.68 --> 03:19:37.12 heart and I still had it there and I lost a little bit of who I was and reg it took years
03:19:37.12 --> 03:19:45.28 for me to regain that and it was only through the grace of time of
03:19:45.28 --> 03:19:58.32 sometimes prayer, a friends, of mentors, of making mistakes that I was able to find that light
03:19:58.32 --> 03:20:04.24 and get a little bit back of who I was and learn through the process. What did it look like when
03:20:04.24 --> 03:20:12.48 how did that how did that anger and hatred manifested itself when you're at the University of San Diego
03:20:12.48 --> 03:20:16.40 on a sunny day and you're in the library and you've got to turn it a paper.
03:20:17.44 --> 03:20:30.96 So I have never even I haven't really talked about this but for me I felt I had a huge obligation
03:20:32.24 --> 03:20:38.24 to work as hard as I could to do the things I wanted to do because I owed it to Mark and Mikey
03:20:38.24 --> 03:20:47.20 and Ryan. It didn't manifest itself in the libraries of the University of San Diego. It
03:20:47.20 --> 03:20:54.88 manifested itself in my relationships with people I loved and not that I was I became my father
03:20:54.88 --> 03:21:00.88 and was abusive or verbally abusive to the people but I took my anger out in less than healthy ways.
03:21:00.88 --> 03:21:11.36 I am sad and embarrassed to admit but I get the little things would take me off and I would find
03:21:11.36 --> 03:21:22.64 myself punching a wall or breaking something and I think about that now and I understand that
03:21:22.64 --> 03:21:28.72 the frame of mine I was in and the kind of hurt I was in post-war and I just didn't
03:21:28.72 --> 03:21:34.48 have the healthiest way to deal with that and now that years have gone by and I've talking to
03:21:34.48 --> 03:21:41.44 our own classmates who have gone through their own battles the demons post-war realize I wasn't the
03:21:41.44 --> 03:21:49.52 only one but a lot of it I had to deal with on my own or through the patience of my wife who has
03:21:49.52 --> 03:22:02.08 been my biggest support through all of this. It took years for me to learn to be human again,
03:22:02.08 --> 03:22:11.04 to let go of that anger, to sublimate all those experiences, all that raw emotions and to good
03:22:11.04 --> 03:22:21.12 and when I think about some of my behavior the universe and not that I was out of completely
03:22:21.12 --> 03:22:26.80 out of line or anything I mean I was a good student I did well if you talk to people who I was
03:22:26.80 --> 03:22:33.84 in class with I mean I was not controversial in any ways but when I had started painting
03:22:33.84 --> 03:22:48.16 I was respectful and I voiced them and one of the biggest hard for me to say it I still to this
03:22:48.16 --> 03:22:55.60 day have hard time saying it just because it's it's just a word that's not it's very foreign to
03:22:55.60 --> 03:23:06.16 someone who is a seal. The learning to lower my defenses and be vulnerable was the light one of the
03:23:06.16 --> 03:23:15.28 biggest lights for me learning to be more of a human and that happened in medical school. It was
03:23:18.32 --> 03:23:24.24 I remember this why I had an experience in medical school where we do these talks about our
03:23:24.24 --> 03:23:30.32 experiences in the hospital and we were talking about like something called the hidden curriculum
03:23:30.32 --> 03:23:35.76 I can even tell you what that is now but it was we were talking I mean I was to say it was a
03:23:36.72 --> 03:23:42.000 touchy feeling kind of conversation was that's basically kind of what it was and I was I hated
03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:51.12 these talks I hated talking about it about my feelings to my classmates and a lot I think a lot of
03:23:51.12 --> 03:23:59.44 it was just pride because I was like I've been through so much more than dealing with the expectation
03:23:59.44 --> 03:24:07.44 of our supervisors in this medical school and this hidden curriculum and the difficulties
03:24:07.44 --> 03:24:11.04 of dealing with sick and dying patients like I've been through worse like I don't want to talk
03:24:11.04 --> 03:24:20.000 about my feelings and it made for a very rough person to be around and I don't think I
03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:26.32 wore my emotion to my face and I just didn't participate in the discussions and I had two
03:24:26.32 --> 03:24:33.68 caring physicians professors at the time pull me into our office and like look it's very visible
03:24:33.68 --> 03:24:39.92 that you don't enjoy these conversations and you pull a computer and your heart to talk to
03:24:39.92 --> 03:24:46.08 you and you detach yourself and like what's what's going on like this is a serious problem
03:24:46.08 --> 03:24:56.16 and I took that to heart and I examined where I was coming from and I realized that I just
03:24:56.16 --> 03:24:59.92 I didn't want to be vulnerable I didn't want to talk about my feelings this way because there was a
03:24:59.92 --> 03:25:06.88 lot of other things a lot of other baggage I had I had still but having that conversation and that
03:25:06.88 --> 03:25:16.48 guidance to open up really helped me become a better human in many ways which then led to being a
03:25:16.48 --> 03:25:23.12 better follower being a better leader so those are one of many experiences in that phase of life
03:25:24.08 --> 03:25:33.20 that helped me be a better candidate for NASA and for for other opportunities that have come
03:25:33.20 --> 03:25:43.92 I'm trying to overlay my own experiences you know kind of parallel to years and just thinking about things
03:25:44.56 --> 03:25:50.000 and I again I always say I got very very lucky one of the things that I got incredibly lucky
03:25:50.72 --> 03:25:58.32 with was when we got home from Romani two things happened number one I had a wife and three kids
03:25:58.32 --> 03:26:11.04 all at the optimum age as far as I can can tell the optimum age to connect with in the
03:26:12.24 --> 03:26:18.96 their their young enough that they're looking at you like you're a superhero they're old enough
03:26:18.96 --> 03:26:25.84 that they're not babies and I can see in their eyes like their people I guess that's the that's
03:26:25.84 --> 03:26:30.40 the big point like they were old enough they were in that age group you know three four five
03:26:30.40 --> 03:26:36.16 six years old where they're looking at me I'm looking at a little person right so I have that going on
03:26:36.16 --> 03:26:43.76 and plus my wife of course so I'm coming home to that and then at the same time I take over the training
03:26:44.64 --> 03:26:51.60 and where I'm around team guys not only my around team guys but all these little emotions that you
03:26:51.60 --> 03:26:57.84 have well you went through work up when I was running training with Seth like I was allowed
03:26:58.56 --> 03:27:06.24 to express my emotions about the teams and doing a good job and cover move and you better
03:27:06.24 --> 03:27:11.04 hey leader you better step up and take charge and hey you better get out like not only was I
03:27:11.04 --> 03:27:15.12 allowed do that it was beneficial for the guys that were going through the training because they
03:27:15.12 --> 03:27:20.72 got to see that I really cared about this and I didn't want anything to happen to them and like
03:27:20.72 --> 03:27:29.60 that so I got to like let those emotions out enough and then at the same time in my home life I was
03:27:29.60 --> 03:27:36.80 like oh I was looking at a little human being and going wait a second I can't this isn't this isn't
03:27:36.80 --> 03:27:43.20 to place to be emotional or be angry this kids looking at me like I'm a superhero and like I should
03:27:43.20 --> 03:27:49.36 become and that's what I'm going to be so kind of a cool very lucky situation that on the one hand I
03:27:49.36 --> 03:27:56.96 got to express and be around team guys and be raw as raw could be with team guys and at the same time
03:27:56.96 --> 03:28:04.40 learn that oh by the way you know it's not normal to it always freaked out late and Seth that I would
03:28:04.40 --> 03:28:09.52 go home and I never would swear in front of my kids and like obviously in front of a sealed
03:28:09.52 --> 03:28:14.80 tutor I would just go off and I'd come home and just be I don't want to say I'd be a different person
03:28:14.80 --> 03:28:20.32 but it kind of be a different person you know I'd kind of learned to all right this is okay over here
03:28:20.32 --> 03:28:27.12 it's not okay over there you look at a you look at a five-year-old girl or a you know a four-year-old boy
03:28:27.76 --> 03:28:34.80 and you go you know what this kid's counting on me to make some halfway decent decisions and I think
03:28:34.80 --> 03:28:47.76 that made me very quickly um figure out what I needed to do to move forward and um whereas for you
03:28:47.76 --> 03:28:52.72 I'm sitting there drawing that parallel course you're getting taken from that team guy environment
03:28:54.16 --> 03:29:02.72 to this non-teen guy environment to the end degree and boom here you go you got to box all that stuff up
03:29:02.72 --> 03:29:08.40 and figure out what to do with it real quick and and there's no real good outlet and the outlet becomes
03:29:09.44 --> 03:29:15.20 you know the wall the freaking plate the whatever that anger needs an outlet and
03:29:16.08 --> 03:29:20.000 when you let it out it's not the best place and it takes you a little while to figure out okay I see what's
03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:29.36 going on here yeah what you described took me years to learn and it is
03:29:29.36 --> 03:29:42.16 probably one of the most important traits of being a leader is having one the emotional and social
03:29:42.16 --> 03:29:48.32 intelligence of knowing your audience knowing who you're talking to and being dynamic enough
03:29:48.96 --> 03:29:55.92 that you can switch and craft your language your body language your tone of voice everything you do
03:29:55.92 --> 03:30:05.04 to suit the person you're talking to you can the way I would talk to a puttune seals
03:30:05.84 --> 03:30:14.96 would be very different then the way I would talk to a 60 year old COPD patient and COPD is like
03:30:14.96 --> 03:30:22.000 a long disease from common in folks who smoke who is in the hospital for the end of the time
03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:29.04 who wants to quit smoking and is frustrated and needs some guidance that patient is a different
03:30:29.04 --> 03:30:38.72 population and being able to have the clarity and intelligence to know that and to switch your language
03:30:38.72 --> 03:30:47.20 appropriately is so important to yield results and that goes for everything I'm you just that's why
03:30:47.20 --> 03:30:56.16 blanket leadership tenants don't work guiding principles work but you need a format
03:30:57.52 --> 03:31:03.44 to your own style to achieve the results and I think a lot of it starts with awareness
03:31:04.64 --> 03:31:10.72 with mindfulness of your own emotions of the emotions the body language that others are telling
03:31:10.72 --> 03:31:15.52 you because it gives you hints as to what they're feeling and if you know what they're feeling
03:31:15.52 --> 03:31:22.72 you understand where they're coming from that perspective you can disarm people by finding common ground
03:31:23.60 --> 03:31:33.20 and achieving results because most of the time all people want good things they just disagree on
03:31:33.20 --> 03:31:40.24 how to achieve that yeah the some you're gonna I'm gonna give you copy this new book I wrote
03:31:40.24 --> 03:31:46.000 in your book oh cool I'm glad we talked about everything that's in that book today so so much of this
03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:51.68 stuff is exactly what I talk about one of the things I talk about there in there is you know modulating
03:31:52.32 --> 03:31:56.80 you know how you have to modulate your leadership principles and how you know you can't use the same
03:31:56.80 --> 03:32:01.36 tool with one person the same way you use that same tool with a different person the same way you use it
03:32:01.36 --> 03:32:07.68 with someone else you have to understand who you're dealing with and figure out how much of that
03:32:07.68 --> 03:32:14.16 specific tool to apply if you can even use that tool because different people respond differently to different
03:32:14.16 --> 03:32:21.44 things absolutely you know what I wish I'm gonna admit I have not read any of your books
03:32:22.24 --> 03:32:28.08 but I've learned from watching you from watching lathe from watching other leaders you know Scott
03:32:28.08 --> 03:32:36.64 who is my next OSC and mentors along the road and making mistakes all these tried and true lessons
03:32:36.64 --> 03:32:45.20 I've been fortunate to make those mistakes and learn from them and you know I wish I had
03:32:45.84 --> 03:32:50.40 a book like that to teach me but maybe wouldn't have been effective maybe it requires a little
03:32:50.40 --> 03:32:55.04 bit of suffering through those mistakes to really hit home there's there's certain things that you
03:32:55.04 --> 03:32:59.84 can learn from a book there's certain things you can't one thing that's nice is you for people
03:32:59.84 --> 03:33:05.92 that give me feedback on these books. Lay for give lay feedback on these books is if they have a
03:33:05.92 --> 03:33:10.56 little bit of context man you look at them and you go every but every single person that reads
03:33:10.56 --> 03:33:14.88 one of these books because I wish I would add this book and you know what I respond with I wish I had
03:33:14.88 --> 03:33:20.24 it too I wish I'd have to learn these lessons the hard way but sometimes sometimes sometimes that's
03:33:20.24 --> 03:33:24.24 the way you're gonna learn them but sometimes I mean it's not like anything we've talked about
03:33:24.24 --> 03:33:31.28 today is super novel that people haven't heard you need there's a right time and a right place to
03:33:31.28 --> 03:33:38.32 hear the lesson and advice and sometimes I'm certain a lot of the lessons I follow and principal
03:33:38.32 --> 03:33:45.20 guiding principles I live by every day I'm serving with humility remembering the sacrifices of others
03:33:45.92 --> 03:33:52.16 respecting everyone not taking things for granted those were said to me as a kid I just wasn't in the
03:33:52.16 --> 03:33:59.60 right frame of mind to receive those lessons so I firmly believe that people need to be ready
03:33:59.60 --> 03:34:06.24 to be mentored and to be taught well that's the that's what he melodies all about right and
03:34:06.24 --> 03:34:11.52 that one of the things that I talk about is the one person that you can't turn into a good
03:34:11.52 --> 03:34:15.52 leader is the one that's not humble because they're not listening to what you say and they're not
03:34:15.52 --> 03:34:20.000 accepting any guidance and so you're not gonna be able to get them to move in the right direction
03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:31.52 they're just gonna continue to suck as a leader so you get into Harvard and you know I know
03:34:31.52 --> 03:34:35.60 I read that letter that I know I know Rayford wrote you letters I mean we all did everything we could
03:34:35.60 --> 03:34:43.92 to support you getting in you got into Harvard but then the navy wasn't gonna let you go
03:34:45.20 --> 03:34:46.96 what happened that's right
03:34:46.96 --> 03:34:53.20 I haven't thought about this in a long time because this is why you owe me a six pack
03:34:54.96 --> 03:35:03.68 more than that so when the instruction for this seeming to animal program I was in was written
03:35:03.68 --> 03:35:10.32 it didn't take into context the various programs that would be there to support medical school
03:35:10.96 --> 03:35:16.40 and I can throw out a bunch of fancy language but basically there were three avenues to go to
03:35:16.40 --> 03:35:24.000 medical school through the military there was useis the uniform services of health science
03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:32.48 I yes the military medical school there was two routes to go to a civilian medical school one was
03:35:32.48 --> 03:35:39.28 basically a scholarship where they paid for school and another one was they keep you active duty
03:35:39.28 --> 03:35:42.96 as an unlisted person but you would have to pay your own tuition
03:35:42.96 --> 03:35:51.28 me having already been in the navy for ten years wanted to stay in the navy for many reasons
03:35:51.28 --> 03:35:58.000 one I had already had a scholarship to Harvard as well as generous financially that paid a hundred
03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:03.92 percent of my tuition so I didn't need the scholarship to pay for school what I did need
03:36:04.56 --> 03:36:10.08 was the trich hair benefits and the salary to support my growing family into the navy it's
03:36:10.08 --> 03:36:19.28 it's essentially the same cost right so my program the seaming animal program did not take into consideration
03:36:19.92 --> 03:36:26.72 the program where you stay in listed and there wasn't because it wasn't a good route it just
03:36:26.72 --> 03:36:32.56 wasn't considered because the time of the instruction was written that in listed program wasn't written
03:36:32.56 --> 03:36:41.84 and I wanted to apply to that on the program but was being told by my my you know my
03:36:41.84 --> 03:36:48.24 superiors at the rots unit that I couldn't do it because of the instruction and that's I'm
03:36:48.24 --> 03:37:01.44 for I am not I am not a believer in circumventing the chain of command and in this case I let my
03:37:02.48 --> 03:37:09.28 who's a lieutenant like proctor let him know like I'd like to see if I can pursue this avenue
03:37:09.28 --> 03:37:18.64 and a parallel path and trying to get approval for this and the response I got was a good luck and
03:37:18.64 --> 03:37:27.44 that's when I reached out to you and told you the situation and you asked a specific officer
03:37:29.36 --> 03:37:35.92 who I still actually keep in touch with because I remember he did not know who I was but
03:37:35.92 --> 03:37:42.80 the very fact that we were both from the same brotherhood from teams that he went out of his way
03:37:42.80 --> 03:37:48.24 and he was working I think in buepers or some personnel command that had access to these types
03:37:48.24 --> 03:37:53.68 to the people that can make these types of decisions and he was able to secure or at least share
03:37:53.68 --> 03:37:58.24 this story what I was going through to the right people and once those right people heard the
03:37:58.24 --> 03:38:02.40 situation is like well that's easy of course it just wasn't it wasn't considered because it's a
03:38:02.40 --> 03:38:07.28 clerical thing not because it's not like shouldn't be allowed so once the right people heard
03:38:07.28 --> 03:38:13.12 the story that yeah absolutely will support you and it wouldn't have been made possible if it wasn't
03:38:13.12 --> 03:38:20.32 for the support of the teams yeah that was awesome and my role was just knowing who to call
03:38:20.32 --> 03:38:26.32 and you know I had you know no power but the people that people that you know and the
03:38:26.32 --> 03:38:31.44 relationship that you build over time is like hey guys here's what's going on and the
03:38:31.44 --> 03:38:36.80 guys that are in powerful positions or in the right position and the right spot with the right
03:38:36.80 --> 03:38:40.72 poll can make things happen and and they do it for the right reasons why like just like you
03:38:40.72 --> 03:38:44.16 said it wasn't because it wasn't the right thing was absolutely the right thing to do it's like
03:38:44.16 --> 03:38:49.76 hey we got an opportunity for a guy to go to Harvard Medical School and be able to support his
03:38:49.76 --> 03:38:55.92 family with what he's doing that who who could possibly think that's not a freaking awesome idea
03:38:55.92 --> 03:39:01.76 and that's all it needed just needed a little light shed on it I'll always be indebted in great
03:39:01.76 --> 03:39:10.64 for the action to those to go out on a limb and support me and I think like you said it goes to
03:39:10.64 --> 03:39:15.60 show when you are in a position to be able to help someone and it's for the right reasons and it's
03:39:15.60 --> 03:39:22.48 done responsibly you should do that that's the right human thing to do is to help others on their path
03:39:22.48 --> 03:39:29.84 now what when you said going from US going from the teams to USD and then from USD
03:39:29.84 --> 03:39:34.56 to medical school you said that was a hard transition too going to medical school was that
03:39:34.56 --> 03:39:39.36 am I catching that right did I hear that right was not as Harvard transition as the teams
03:39:39.36 --> 03:39:44.40 to just civilian life in general I would say that that and that was like the transitions to the
03:39:44.40 --> 03:39:52.08 teams to non teams because you said to yourself but I joined the Navy at 18 years old I was
03:39:52.08 --> 03:39:59.52 completely indoctrinated into the military and you like to think there's bubbles everywhere right we
03:39:59.52 --> 03:40:05.60 all everyone lives in a bubble to a certain extent and in the military we like to pride ourselves
03:40:05.60 --> 03:40:12.80 in a plethora of wide ranging experiences but if you think and we like to compare ourselves to
03:40:12.80 --> 03:40:18.24 maybe civilians or people who are not don't have those opportunities to get those types of
03:40:18.24 --> 03:40:23.20 overseas experiences but if you think for a second that you may not be in a bubble yourself just
03:40:23.20 --> 03:40:31.28 because you're in the military you're wrong I was in that bubble and I quickly discovered that I was
03:40:31.28 --> 03:40:38.16 indoctrinated and yes I went to a very liberal arts college and I may not have
03:40:39.76 --> 03:40:45.60 agreed with everything that was discussed but you know what learning to respectfully voice my opinion
03:40:45.60 --> 03:40:52.24 and listen to others voice their opinions is so important to being a productive member of society
03:40:52.88 --> 03:41:00.16 so I am so thankful that I was able to step outside of my bubble into the civilian world and see
03:41:00.16 --> 03:41:07.36 how operations are done on that side and I it just helped me be a more rounded person a more rounded
03:41:07.36 --> 03:41:15.28 human being and I'm so thankful it's just that it was very painful because I was not ready for
03:41:15.28 --> 03:41:19.60 that transition and I don't I think a lot of veterans are not ready as well and I think that's
03:41:19.60 --> 03:41:25.20 why it's a lot of times it's hard for veterans to transition from the military into civilian life
03:41:27.04 --> 03:41:33.84 how hard was a Harvard medical school for you it was it was hard it was
03:41:34.88 --> 03:41:38.88 what does a day look like or what is a week either a day or a week like what does that look like
03:41:38.88 --> 03:41:45.36 going Harvard medical school I mean for me was juggling the demand of a growing family you know
03:41:45.36 --> 03:41:50.32 my head my first child my second child was born during medical school my third child is born
03:41:50.32 --> 03:41:57.68 during internship so you didn't get my sleep and you just learned to optimize your day like you
03:41:57.68 --> 03:42:02.48 can't make more hours in a day and this is when I learned that becoming a morning person was
03:42:02.48 --> 03:42:11.84 a better way to optimize my day so and I I am not a genius by any means I consider myself very
03:42:11.84 --> 03:42:18.88 average physically mentally it's just that I feel that I can stick with the goals and have
03:42:18.88 --> 03:42:26.72 deferred gratification to help support me for my goals that's it work working hard is all I know
03:42:26.72 --> 03:42:34.96 I can do to make up for any advantages natural or otherwise that I don't have so I do feel that
03:42:34.96 --> 03:42:39.44 I had to study more than the average student at Harvard medical school and there were some smart
03:42:39.44 --> 03:42:46.80 folks there and on top of having personal responsibilities to being a father and a husband
03:42:46.80 --> 03:42:53.04 those were challenging so I learned that hey I need to wake up super early study in my most
03:42:53.04 --> 03:42:59.68 optimum time workout and that's it was just learning these changes to optimize my life
03:43:01.44 --> 03:43:08.32 how early would you wake up in medical school I was waking up around 330
03:43:09.20 --> 03:43:15.68 and then what you maintain your workouts all the time no at what point at what was that kind of
03:43:15.68 --> 03:43:20.56 one of the early things to go did you hang on to it as long as you could it it lost I lost it my
03:43:20.56 --> 03:43:27.60 first year and I I you know in your 20s you can eat junk food you can get away with all these
03:43:27.60 --> 03:43:34.000 things you can work off any bad diet you have as you get to your later 20s and your 30s like you
03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:41.92 can't do that you have to eat well and I was getting I was overweight in first year of med school
03:43:41.92 --> 03:43:47.76 and there came a point like I can't do this to myself like this main team in my health is
03:43:47.76 --> 03:43:55.28 for my sanity for my health and I owe it like I don't care if I'm super busy I should be
03:43:55.28 --> 03:43:59.04 able to find a half hour an hour and so I would say towards the second and third I'm just
03:43:59.04 --> 03:44:04.96 that first year I lost sight of that and then after that bought a treadmill bought weights
03:44:06.56 --> 03:44:11.60 in our my little basement so I had no reason not to work out so then I was waking up super early
03:44:11.60 --> 03:44:15.68 giving my work out in first thing in the morning and then just trying to crush as much studying
03:44:15.68 --> 03:44:21.04 as I could in the in the morning hours because I knew once I came home from school there's no work
03:44:21.04 --> 03:44:27.92 getting done for hours because my son and my wife I mean they I need to be there for them and a
03:44:27.92 --> 03:44:34.000 lot of times it wasn't I was not the best husband and father during those years
03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:40.80 and that's because you got an exam in two days or you got a paper do and then just that's you're just
03:44:40.80 --> 03:44:49.12 don't you can't do it yeah I I was not I don't think able to do that very well I tried but I
03:44:49.92 --> 03:44:56.88 I think I could have done better at what point did you decide maybe going into space would be a good
03:44:56.88 --> 03:45:03.68 idea so we talked about accidents and we call whatever we want I have no plan I had no plan to do
03:45:03.68 --> 03:45:07.36 any of these things I we talked about I had no plan to be a doctor it's just something that came
03:45:07.36 --> 03:45:16.32 out of deployment of a body of seeing the compassion and the good that physicians and nurses were
03:45:16.32 --> 03:45:21.44 doing to our brothers and sisters who were wounded in combat and I wanted to be able to do that type
03:45:21.44 --> 03:45:27.20 of good as well and that's why I directed to medicine space was never on the horizon we talked a
03:45:27.20 --> 03:45:35.52 little bit about where I came from that scared little boy and grew up under my father shadow I
03:45:35.52 --> 03:45:44.56 never thought I could have been a seal or a doctor or an astronaut there's no way it was a different
03:45:44.56 --> 03:45:55.60 life and I was a different person and the first time I heard about NASA and this opportunity I don't
03:45:55.60 --> 03:46:03.28 I don't have a great story for it it's just I heard about being national and it's like that's kind of
03:46:03.28 --> 03:46:08.16 interesting when we're like other than space exploration like what you do and learning about the
03:46:08.16 --> 03:46:14.40 impact that national arts can have on our next generation and what Apollo did for our country I mean
03:46:15.76 --> 03:46:21.84 in the 60s we were able to land a human on the moon with that technology
03:46:23.60 --> 03:46:32.96 despite a growing race with Russia and all the politics going on during that era
03:46:32.96 --> 03:46:39.28 Kennedy's assassination we were able to complete that and that secured American preeminence
03:46:39.28 --> 03:46:46.16 in science technology for decades to come I certainly believe that and the benefits we got from that
03:46:47.04 --> 03:46:54.72 are you can't count that and learning a little bit more about that and how astronauts have
03:46:54.72 --> 03:47:03.68 had the opportunity to represent humanity for good and bring together countries in a way that
03:47:05.84 --> 03:47:13.52 politics and alliances cannot do when you talk to some of the Apollo astronauts who landed on the moon
03:47:13.52 --> 03:47:20.08 and they did their international travel the comment the feedback they would get from people would be
03:47:20.08 --> 03:47:28.96 we did it we did it together it wasn't you Americans did it it was we did it and that was
03:47:28.96 --> 03:47:35.04 powerful that countries could come together and see that as a human accomplishment so there's
03:47:35.04 --> 03:47:41.20 something about space that takes away those borders because when you're up there you don't see
03:47:41.60 --> 03:47:48.56 these distinct borders between countries you just see a lot of blue and a lot of land and you see
03:47:48.56 --> 03:47:56.48 how fragile the planet is so once I learned a little bit about that type of impact and that
03:47:57.68 --> 03:48:03.36 you can have a huge impact on the next generation of explorers of scientists of people who want to
03:48:03.36 --> 03:48:12.40 be a better version of themselves maybe I could reach out to those kids just like me who are scared
03:48:12.40 --> 03:48:20.24 tired who don't think they can amount to anything who don't think they're worth anything if I could
03:48:20.24 --> 03:48:28.000 reach out to them and let them know that hey doesn't matter where you're from with the right attitude
03:48:28.72 --> 03:48:35.20 with the right hard work if you get up every time you fail you can amount to something and you can do
03:48:35.20 --> 03:48:43.44 positive work you can leave a good impact a positive mark for our world that meant a lot to me
03:48:45.12 --> 03:48:53.20 and that's when I put my name in the hat and wanted to be a nationalot because it was completely
03:48:53.20 --> 03:49:01.60 consistent with my goals that I promised Mikey Mark Ryan long list of our brothers who are not
03:49:01.60 --> 03:49:08.32 here with us today that I would for the rest of my life do something to impact positive
03:49:09.60 --> 03:49:18.24 good in our world is it um was it is there a recruiter that comes around I mean where did you
03:49:18.24 --> 03:49:25.12 dare pick up a brochure in class where did you you must have the idea get you must have been watching
03:49:25.12 --> 03:49:30.08 you know a movie or something and gone wow that where did come from you know so I was
03:49:30.08 --> 03:49:37.84 I through just rain and circumstances got in met a action a former astronaut named Scott parents and
03:49:37.84 --> 03:49:44.72 ski who was is also a physician and served with the shuttle during the shuttle era and had a lot of
03:49:45.28 --> 03:49:52.40 great missions and a huge impact and listened to him talk passionately about our space program
03:49:52.40 --> 03:49:57.84 that kind of gave me the idea and then just like in the teams I just researched what it meant to be
03:49:57.84 --> 03:50:03.20 what the requirements were and the realized I actually like my math degree was consistent with that
03:50:04.08 --> 03:50:10.96 getting a medical degree having the operational experience working in close teams making hard
03:50:10.96 --> 03:50:18.08 decisions with limited data under constrained times those were all consistent with the traits and
03:50:18.08 --> 03:50:25.28 experiences that NASA was looking for throw so through an accident or whatever you want to call it
03:50:25.28 --> 03:50:33.68 I was able to have this privilege and honor to serve our astronaut core what's that screening
03:50:33.68 --> 03:50:40.32 process how many interviews did you go through before they gave you the yet the up check so
03:50:41.60 --> 03:50:50.88 there are I can't go into great detail of of this just because of the sensitivity around
03:50:50.88 --> 03:50:57.20 application to actually right now coisently NASA is looking for the next class of astronauts
03:50:57.20 --> 03:51:02.56 I know I saw that on your Instagram till till the end of March which Johnny Kims out recruit in the
03:51:02.56 --> 03:51:09.76 for NASA so they keep it a little bit they keep it a little bit um I don't want to say secret but
03:51:09.76 --> 03:51:16.96 they keep it somewhat a little bit of a mystery I don't say they they there's just some finer details
03:51:16.96 --> 03:51:22.000 about the process that are not generally um public knowledge I mean I think I think you're probably
03:51:22.000 --> 03:51:28.56 finding on Google there are I went through a couple interviews there's a process where you're screened
03:51:28.56 --> 03:51:34.32 based on your paper application and they reach out to references letters of recommendation
03:51:34.32 --> 03:51:39.84 and then they invite you for an interview and you're there for three or four days going through an
03:51:39.84 --> 03:51:47.04 interview doing these tests medical tests and also like teen based tests where you're working with
03:51:47.04 --> 03:51:51.52 people that you have worked before and seeing how you saw the problem and they're observing how you
03:51:51.52 --> 03:51:55.68 react all right let's see bro I know this stuff might be sensitive and everything but you got to
03:51:55.68 --> 03:52:01.28 give me at least one cool thing that they I want to know that they put you in like an escape room I
03:52:01.28 --> 03:52:06.16 want to know that you had to like they were they were had they were shouldn't paint ball at you
03:52:06.16 --> 03:52:12.32 while you were doing math problems come on give me something you know indulge my fantasy a little bit
03:52:13.60 --> 03:52:20.88 nothing like that the it was fun really really funny you do things that you have never done before
03:52:21.84 --> 03:52:26.16 there were some obstacles like you'd be like hey you get a piece of paper and you're with your
03:52:26.16 --> 03:52:31.76 your group and you're like hey you need to get to from point eight a point b but you can't touch
03:52:31.76 --> 03:52:37.76 the grass in between you in point eight point b and you might have like a barrel or a piece of wood or
03:52:37.76 --> 03:52:44.24 some string or something you need to devise a way to utilize the resources you have and work
03:52:44.24 --> 03:52:50.48 effectively in a team to like accomplish your mission and that's like just one example of some
03:52:50.48 --> 03:52:56.64 of the team based things and that's publicly out there now what what I like about that what's interesting
03:52:56.64 --> 03:53:03.20 so let's talk about this in my last book the sometimes people feel like when they when they're
03:53:03.20 --> 03:53:08.32 trying to show leadership what they need to do is like step up and tell everyone what to do and
03:53:09.84 --> 03:53:14.96 it's interesting to me because I know what you're like and I know that I know that you wouldn't
03:53:14.96 --> 03:53:18.24 necessarily be the guy who goes oh I never will listen up this is how we're going to get the barrel you
03:53:18.24 --> 03:53:22.16 be like okay let's let's figure hey anyone got a good idea what do you think of this what do you think of
03:53:22.16 --> 03:53:29.76 that and I just think it's a good I think you're like living proof because sometimes I get push back of
03:53:30.16 --> 03:53:35.36 we don't if you don't step up no one's going to notice you if you don't start barking orders no one's
03:53:35.36 --> 03:53:39.84 going to listen to you and I have to tell people over and over again that's not true I mean how many
03:53:39.84 --> 03:53:47.76 times did you hear me yell at life or Seth or anyone in task in a bruiser and our
03:53:47.76 --> 03:53:55.92 emergency single time and that's not something I would you praise in public but criticize in public is
03:53:56.56 --> 03:54:02.80 is not I cannot think of a situation where that is a good idea to humiliate or be little
03:54:03.44 --> 03:54:09.92 a subordinate that is that is not in gender trust that is a very immature thing to do and that's
03:54:09.92 --> 03:54:17.12 what we talk about like letting your motion take control your ego take control of your actions
03:54:17.12 --> 03:54:22.88 you know it's not something I've ever seen and and people look at me and they judge a book by the
03:54:22.88 --> 03:54:28.88 cover and they think oh juggle man can you imagine you must just been crazy yell it's like no
03:54:28.88 --> 03:54:34.24 no doesn't work and that's what I like about like we even just this little tidbit you're given us
03:54:34.24 --> 03:54:40.08 is to convince people to say listen if you want to be in charge that doesn't mean you bark orders
03:54:40.08 --> 03:54:44.96 actually someone that's good will start off by listening to one of the people have to say
03:54:44.96 --> 03:54:49.84 taking other opinions let's formulate a good plan together and those things are so important and
03:54:49.84 --> 03:54:56.40 it's your proof and I'm only imagining that when you were given a task there was a couple
03:54:56.40 --> 03:55:02.80 people in the group that like oh my god listen to me and I bet the the judges for lack of a better
03:55:02.80 --> 03:55:08.000 word wrote down okay bill over here he really likes to bark orders and tell everyone what to do
03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:13.44 and that's not going to go for well being part of a team absolutely I mean being good leader is
03:55:13.44 --> 03:55:20.56 being a good follower first and we talked about having that emotional human social intelligence
03:55:20.56 --> 03:55:26.000 of what to do and when to do it and how you do it and that's so important how you craft that language
03:55:26.000 --> 03:55:33.04 and that tone of voice I mean I think there is no template to leadership and people need to find
03:55:33.04 --> 03:55:44.64 their own way of executing that for me I listen I sit back and I am a big believer in quality
03:55:44.64 --> 03:55:53.84 over quantity of what you say in my experience the less you say but the more thoughtful it is
03:55:53.84 --> 03:56:02.72 the more people listen the more you speak and oftentimes when you speak a lot it's less thoughtful
03:56:03.44 --> 03:56:11.92 the less people listen yeah and I try and exercise that and everything I do especially at NASA
03:56:13.68 --> 03:56:22.16 and learning to it's very applicable in a seal puttune learning to gain currency when I mean my
03:56:22.16 --> 03:56:29.04 currency you can call it reputation whatever you want leadership capital capital gaining this capital
03:56:29.04 --> 03:56:36.08 this currency by at least what I've seen to be effective for others and myself is
03:56:37.36 --> 03:56:44.48 shutting up and doing a good job and not complaining but speaking up when it is appropriate
03:56:44.48 --> 03:56:52.88 respectfully and thoughtfully you gain that currency so that hopefully one day when you do need
03:56:52.88 --> 03:56:59.44 to bark orders because of time sensitivity or just the situation calls for it you can cash in
03:56:59.44 --> 03:57:05.36 that currency you've gained enough and that the people around your teammates be like Roger that I'm
03:57:05.36 --> 03:57:17.76 going to follow because you have gained my trust so there's a time for everything and at least
03:57:17.76 --> 03:57:23.36 for me I found that barking orders to especially to people you don't know is probably very poor form
03:57:23.36 --> 03:57:30.08 doesn't work very well and yeah the the code I have in that book over and over again is
03:57:30.08 --> 03:57:38.72 the last you talk the more people listen I in my experience I found that to be true so okay so
03:57:38.72 --> 03:57:47.68 you get selected all right and you do all kinds of cool tests did we we can't even talk about
03:57:47.68 --> 03:57:52.80 them echo Charles you know that some proof room that they do like an army get it you're watching
03:57:52.80 --> 03:57:59.20 moving I have is that the one where they blow up the meteor that's right yeah so remember
03:57:59.20 --> 03:58:02.88 they put them in that soundproof room and they give them a bunch of questions and they're like hey
03:58:02.88 --> 03:58:08.24 don't go crazy or whatever I don't remember this part but keep going I was wondering if you did that
03:58:10.24 --> 03:58:19.68 not that I remember there were some long I mean a lot of interviews a lot of tests and I mean
03:58:20.24 --> 03:58:24.32 you're running on and I really can't get into the details but taking like these personality
03:58:24.32 --> 03:58:29.60 these psychology tests yeah that's what they're trying to depict there yeah see if they could
03:58:30.40 --> 03:58:39.92 like keep it together out there whatever right yeah but it's not like I I think you can learn a lot
03:58:39.92 --> 03:58:47.44 about someone I think you learn the most about someone you squeeze them right because in an eight to five
03:58:47.44 --> 03:58:53.28 office job you can put on a mask and be whoever you want to be for that period of time you can
03:58:53.28 --> 03:59:00.48 fool a lot of people but when people are squeezed when you strip away that comfort and they're
03:59:00.48 --> 03:59:07.68 tired and hungry and cold and suffering that armor just gets melted away and you start to see
03:59:07.68 --> 03:59:14.48 true core characteristics and that's why we do hell leak and buds right you want to strip away
03:59:14.48 --> 03:59:20.08 all that armor and see what is left of that person if that is someone you want by your side
03:59:20.08 --> 03:59:25.84 when you aren't your darkest days because you're getting you're in the heat of battle and you're getting
03:59:27.12 --> 03:59:34.96 fired upon you want that person that you know is not going to quit now I'm not saying
03:59:36.24 --> 03:59:41.84 the cheapest and easiest way to find candidates is through a rock on them and say margin this
03:59:41.84 --> 03:59:47.60 direction and I won't tell you and stop when I tell you I think you would get certainly a type of
03:59:47.60 --> 03:59:56.80 profile of person to not quit and to pursue on even not knowing when they'll ever stop but that
03:59:57.76 --> 04:00:03.84 we need to be a little bit more thoughtful of who we're trying to represent our species our country
04:00:03.84 --> 04:00:11.44 for space exploration you don't want otherwise we just have a like a part of like a core of soldiers
04:00:11.44 --> 04:00:19.28 and operators but that's we want people who have that dynamic leadership who understand human
04:00:19.28 --> 04:00:23.92 emotion who can speak to a classroom of fifth graders or third graders can can gardeners
04:00:25.12 --> 04:00:30.000 and share that passion of reading or space exploration and why it's important to study the
04:00:30.000 --> 04:00:35.68 sciences but at the or at the same time talk to a group of engineers and explain to them hey
04:00:35.68 --> 04:00:45.68 respectfully why you need a window in your vehicle because to land appropriately or explaining
04:00:45.68 --> 04:00:50.88 to management why you need to do these certain training activities even though they're really
04:00:50.88 --> 04:00:56.96 expensive or there may be risk to involve like we need to maintain our currency in jets
04:00:57.92 --> 04:01:03.76 because it's an operational environment where we had to make real time decisions that have real
04:01:03.76 --> 04:01:10.96 risks so that we can stay sharp and learn to exercise that operation decision making during stressful times
04:01:12.16 --> 04:01:20.000 so you need someone who can fill all these roles in and push when going gets tough and
04:01:20.80 --> 04:01:27.12 the core tries to use various tests to make sure we're selecting for the right people that can
04:01:27.12 --> 04:01:36.80 do all those things so once you get selected and then it's time to start the training and
04:01:37.60 --> 04:01:42.72 give me give us like an overview of the training what's the pipeline start off with what's like
04:01:42.72 --> 04:01:47.12 the hardest parts and then where does it where does it feel like you kind of level off and you're feeling
04:01:47.12 --> 04:01:54.08 good about it you know every day is different it's I explain it like being in grad school which is
04:01:54.08 --> 04:02:00.16 a more physical component to it I mean there's certain checks in the boxes you need to do like
04:02:00.16 --> 04:02:06.64 you need to get to certain proficiency in speaking Russian and learning to fly the jet if you're
04:02:06.64 --> 04:02:12.16 a pilot flying front seat I'm not a formal military pilot so I had to learn how to be a
04:02:15.28 --> 04:02:18.40 to be an appropriate crew member an effective crew member we are
04:02:18.40 --> 04:02:25.20 serving with a pilot and learning to fly the jet appropriately and work together to complete that
04:02:25.20 --> 04:02:30.48 mission you're learning engineering about the suit the space suit you're in or the
04:02:30.48 --> 04:02:34.08 international space station learning all the different components that heating the cooling
04:02:34.80 --> 04:02:40.24 the electrical components how it recycles water how it recycles urine
04:02:41.84 --> 04:02:47.28 then learning how to operate in the space suit we have this huge pool that has a one-to-one scale of
04:02:47.28 --> 04:02:53.92 the space station in Houston and learning because we don't have in a way to emulate zero gravity on
04:02:53.92 --> 04:03:01.60 our thought obviously but we have buoyancy and we can make neutral buoyancy to emulate what it's
04:03:01.60 --> 04:03:08.000 like to be in a zero or microgravity environment and how it feels to work in a pressurized suit
04:03:08.000 --> 04:03:15.04 to move along and replace batteries work working drills on the space station and I can you learn
04:03:15.04 --> 04:03:21.60 geology we go on trips to learn about various aspects of rock formations how they form why they form
04:03:21.60 --> 04:03:26.80 what's important because this is all relevant we go to Mars we go to the moon we may not be
04:03:26.80 --> 04:03:30.72 able to bring the subject matter experts we don't need to be the subject matter experts we need to
04:03:30.72 --> 04:03:36.88 know in understand we need to have a foundation so that we can go out make effective use of the time
04:03:36.88 --> 04:03:43.76 we have to get the rocks that subject matter experts at home do think is useful so that we can learn
04:03:43.76 --> 04:03:49.76 more about the moon about the Mars and bring that knowledge back to Earth to benefit humanity
04:03:51.12 --> 04:03:59.04 so every day is different does everybody on the team well do you get assigned to like a
04:03:59.04 --> 04:04:04.08 opportunity or a team or are you assigned to a certain group of people that you're going to go on
04:04:04.08 --> 04:04:09.92 a mission together eventually you do in your career when you first show up you're what's called an
04:04:09.92 --> 04:04:16.80 ask can ask a lot candidate so you go through and you you almost do everything together
04:04:18.40 --> 04:04:23.68 did you graduate already from ask can school I did yeah and that was the that was the big
04:04:23.68 --> 04:04:30.96 graduation to replace in January January yes you so once that when you're going through that school
04:04:30.96 --> 04:04:34.16 is that the initial like okay you're learning Russian okay now you're learning about the space
04:04:34.16 --> 04:04:38.88 you're okay now you're working in a weightless environment yep you're learning it's kind of like
04:04:38.88 --> 04:04:44.16 SKT you're learning the basics of what it's like to be an effective astronaut but that training
04:04:44.16 --> 04:04:47.76 never goes away like just like being a seal you don't stop shooting just because you made it
04:04:47.76 --> 04:04:55.52 through SKT it's just the beginning of your of your learning of your professional development and
04:04:55.52 --> 04:05:01.12 you're maintaining all of that so you continue all of those activities maintain speaking your
04:05:01.12 --> 04:05:07.84 Russian practicing in the space you'd flying in a jet you know weekly and then supporting on
04:05:07.84 --> 04:05:14.08 going mission so if you're not assigned which I am not assigned I mean there's a pool of
04:05:14.08 --> 04:05:18.72 astronaut that are always supporting on going missions because that's a priority is supporting on
04:05:18.72 --> 04:05:24.16 going missions and right now we have astronauts that have man the international space station for
04:05:24.16 --> 04:05:34.96 20 years continuously there are people adult where we have been orbiting in man presence in the
04:05:34.96 --> 04:05:41.04 space station one of the people have been alive and we are looking to go back to the moon in 2024
04:05:42.08 --> 04:05:48.72 with our eyes set for deeper exploration two Mars in beyond but it starts off with goodning
04:05:48.72 --> 04:05:58.96 back to the moon and sitting and deploying a sustained presence so our jobs right now if you're not
04:05:58.96 --> 04:06:06.16 assigned to support those ongoing missions in various capacities and later down the road if you are assigned
04:06:06.16 --> 04:06:11.20 then you are depending on the mission you are working more closely with the other people assigned
04:06:11.20 --> 04:06:16.80 to that mission and that might be like a pro that might be like a workout like you find out
04:06:16.80 --> 04:06:21.12 your assigned to a mission maybe a year or two years before and you're working closely with that
04:06:21.12 --> 04:06:28.48 crew instead of a platoon it's a crew and then you go on a mission and now typically missions are
04:06:28.48 --> 04:06:33.20 kind of like deployments there about six seven months sometimes that are long as times are shorter
04:06:33.20 --> 04:06:40.000 an example of a mission would be going to the space station yes that is right now that is the only
04:06:40.000 --> 04:06:46.16 mission that we have is supporting our space station until 2023 in the NERGNOS science someone that's
04:06:46.16 --> 04:06:51.92 going to go to the moon our team absolutely we're under a program that we have called Artemis
04:06:51.92 --> 04:06:59.92 we will send the first woman in the next man back to the moon and have our sights set with boots
04:06:59.92 --> 04:07:07.28 on the ground on the moon by 2024 and that that hasn't been a sign yet and you said sustained
04:07:07.28 --> 04:07:13.52 presence on the moon sustained while getting to the moon by 2024 at this current time
04:07:13.52 --> 04:07:19.92 is not we are not planning on having sustained presence in 2024 by 2028 we are planning on having
04:07:19.92 --> 04:07:27.28 sustained presence on the moon so having the lunar outpost and learning what it's like to live
04:07:27.28 --> 04:07:34.000 called a planetary haka-cou-boon learning what it's like like having challenges and struggles because
04:07:35.04 --> 04:07:41.20 the space station is 250 miles away it's a four-hour trip if something bad happens on the space
04:07:41.20 --> 04:07:48.24 station it's reassuring knowing that there is a vehicle a Soyuz vehicle which is a Russian vehicle
04:07:49.04 --> 04:07:57.28 waiting there to take our crew members back to Earth if needed the moon is longer it's four-ish
04:07:57.28 --> 04:08:06.000 days to get back Mars that's even longer we're talking about months so it's prudent that we learn
04:08:06.000 --> 04:08:13.60 as much as we can but what it's like to live on a different planetary body like the moon before we
04:08:13.60 --> 04:08:18.48 try and get to Mars and that's what having sustained presence on the moon is all about
04:08:22.08 --> 04:08:32.16 the when when do you think you'll get assigned to a crew is it even noble no and it doesn't
04:08:32.16 --> 04:08:37.60 really matter because you're just going to keep doing your job exactly it's irrelevant I
04:08:39.52 --> 04:08:47.12 I still have and hope that I will continue to have this attitude where I'm just happy to be where I am
04:08:47.92 --> 04:08:54.96 I have an immense opportunity that so many deserving people don't have to work in NASA to be in the
04:08:54.96 --> 04:09:02.72 astronaut core that if I never if I never flew it would still be an honor to serve and who knows
04:09:02.72 --> 04:09:08.000 something medical can she can come up an injury can come up where I may be ineligible to for space flight
04:09:08.72 --> 04:09:15.52 it's not time wasted that's not I would still be very feel very privileged and it'd be a huge
04:09:15.52 --> 04:09:23.28 honor to support on going missions so to me I have I don't know when I'll be assigned and I don't care
04:09:23.28 --> 04:09:29.68 I will be happy with whatever I had the honor of doing and I will fulfill any role to the best
04:09:29.68 --> 04:09:39.60 my ability future is bright well listen Johnny we've actually been going out at for a little over four
04:09:39.60 --> 04:09:47.20 hours right now I know we went through your whole life which is not bad in four hours
04:09:47.20 --> 04:09:54.24 what I know people are going to want to contact you talk to you you know getting touch with you
04:09:54.80 --> 04:10:02.88 I know that you're on social media now big time unfortunately I say my words carefully
04:10:02.88 --> 04:10:14.000 but yeah the well it's pretty awesome that in this day and age you know people can connect with you
04:10:14.000 --> 04:10:19.04 and you know I I was very reluctant to start the social media thing I was actually
04:10:21.04 --> 04:10:29.60 well quite frankly mostly generally life's wife who was like hey idiot you need to get on social
04:10:29.60 --> 04:10:34.88 media so you can connect with people and and sure enough I can't even I can't even begin to tell you the amount of
04:10:34.88 --> 04:10:43.36 incredible conversations feedback suggestions information questions that have that has come through
04:10:43.36 --> 04:10:50.08 social media so even though I know you're probably not super comfortable with it I bet you'll find
04:10:50.08 --> 04:10:56.80 that man it's a great way to communicate with other people to to share things with other people
04:10:56.80 --> 04:11:02.32 to share daily life to explain things to people to help people out I mean I think you're going to
04:11:02.32 --> 04:11:07.76 you're going to end up using it for a positive tool which it at look it can be negative all
04:11:07.76 --> 04:11:14.56 day long and you can sit on there you can find people that just want to just just belittle other
04:11:14.56 --> 04:11:19.68 people and make fun of things and tear the world down it's actually not that hard to avoid those
04:11:19.68 --> 04:11:27.76 people and it's really easy to find people that are are looking to learn share grow help
04:11:27.76 --> 04:11:37.60 the social media is filled with that stuff as well well said I have I had zero internet
04:11:38.72 --> 04:11:45.28 presence and I have potentially not have had any social media accounts before NASA and even for the
04:11:45.28 --> 04:11:51.68 first year and a half at being an NASA just because I have such a visceral feeling with social media
04:11:52.40 --> 04:11:57.44 not because I'm not trying to blame the platform because I think we all as human should take
04:11:57.44 --> 04:12:04.80 accountability for our actions and how we use our tools but narcissism is perhaps one of the biggest
04:12:04.80 --> 04:12:10.88 poisons in our society and narcissism breeds narcissism in a lot of times the way I've seen
04:12:10.88 --> 04:12:18.56 social media used as a platform to promote that and when children see that self promotion that
04:12:18.56 --> 04:12:27.60 self idolization they and then want to be YouTube stars and I'm not saying that that's I'm not
04:12:27.60 --> 04:12:31.36 saying that's a bad thing I think people should pursue their dreams but I think it requires some
04:12:31.36 --> 04:12:38.56 self reflection and thoughtfulness as a society of what we value and when you have narcissism
04:12:39.36 --> 04:12:47.52 as a value trait you were by definition putting yourself above others and I think that is
04:12:47.52 --> 04:12:56.72 not sustainable for a growing and evolving society and that's why I find service very sustainable
04:12:57.44 --> 04:13:07.04 because by definition you are putting others before yourself one of my favorite quotes is from Dr.
04:13:07.04 --> 04:13:13.60 Martin Luther King and it's something along the lines of everyone is capable of greatness
04:13:13.60 --> 04:13:21.92 not fame but greatness because greatness is determined by service and I think sometimes people
04:13:23.04 --> 04:13:31.20 think the definition of success is that everyone in the world knows their name and I think
04:13:31.20 --> 04:13:37.76 they're missing the point when that is the goal they're trying to seek and I sometimes see social
04:13:37.76 --> 04:13:45.84 media used in that but I agree with you that when used responsibly respectfully tactfully thoughtfully
04:13:46.56 --> 04:13:55.12 it can be a platform for good and what made me change my mind about actually having a social
04:13:55.12 --> 04:14:02.56 media and I'm not very active I try to make a post a week a buddy of mine from the team said you
04:14:02.56 --> 04:14:09.20 know look you have an opportunity that most people in this world will never have and people just
04:14:09.20 --> 04:14:15.84 want to share in some of what you do and learn about it and if you are using it responsibly
04:14:16.24 --> 04:14:23.28 not for self promotion but to promote others and to share some of the cool science and inspire
04:14:23.28 --> 04:14:33.20 kids adults then you owe it to do that and that was sent to me still about a year before I
04:14:33.20 --> 04:14:43.04 opened up an application open up a platform but it always stuck with me and I guess that's why
04:14:43.76 --> 04:14:50.56 I have been more okay with with having that because I feel that it can be a force for good
04:14:50.56 --> 04:15:02.000 way to use responsibly well with the longest social media preamble ever Johnny Kim is at Johnny Kim
04:15:02.000 --> 04:15:10.64 USA uh I go you're any questions yeah so how do I become an astronaut hypothetically of course
04:15:10.64 --> 04:15:14.96 I mean you you mentioned the application process like what can you just roll into NASA and be like
04:15:14.96 --> 04:15:19.28 hey I want to work here give you an application or what thank you for asking it to draw them
04:15:19.28 --> 04:15:27.44 happy to share that um if you Google NASA astronaut applications you will find a plethora of links
04:15:27.44 --> 04:15:34.24 that describe our requirements and great detail and just off the top my head you need a college
04:15:34.24 --> 04:15:41.20 degree an undergraduate degree in a STEM field as well as a master's degree in a STEM field that's a
04:15:41.20 --> 04:15:46.32 science technology engineering mathematics medicine does count biosciences counts
04:15:46.32 --> 04:15:53.68 like some degrees like nurse and degree or maybe like a physical education degree don't count
04:15:54.96 --> 04:16:00.72 you can find more details online and you need a couple years of work experience and then
04:16:00.72 --> 04:16:06.80 you meet most of the requirements there you can find out on NASA.gov and applications are open right now
04:16:08.40 --> 04:16:13.52 also I noticed your shirt is that like a special you know I mean can I get a shirt like that or
04:16:13.52 --> 04:16:19.36 oh yeah kind of exclusive no I'm not at all the the NASA the most recognized NASA meet we call the
04:16:19.36 --> 04:16:26.96 meatball logo is owned by NASA but we license it out for free right in one so you can just
04:16:26.96 --> 04:16:32.000 go on a Google shop at your favorite store and find a NASA shirt well if they license it out for free
04:16:32.000 --> 04:16:38.24 there may be Jacob podcast NASA sure that's coming at you any Kim addition is it any Kim addition
04:16:38.24 --> 04:16:45.68 is right on thanks Johnny Kim Johnny I know we've been going out for a while but just any other
04:16:45.68 --> 04:16:56.56 closing thoughts from you I'd just like to say thank you to everyone that's had the grace
04:16:56.56 --> 04:17:04.80 in the patience to tolerate my mistakes along my path and care enough to want me to be a better human being
04:17:04.80 --> 04:17:14.64 to thank my mom for being my first hero and teaching me what it means to be strong
04:17:16.24 --> 04:17:24.64 and most importantly I don't think words can ever give the recognition or explain articulate
04:17:24.64 --> 04:17:37.52 the appreciation I have but thank you to my wife and my kids for supporting me for being
04:17:37.52 --> 04:17:52.80 selfless so that I could pursue my dreams and for loving me awesome awesome I know this was kind of a
04:17:52.80 --> 04:18:00.40 long time coming from the beginning you had to wait till you graduated from astronaut school which
04:18:00.40 --> 04:18:06.96 people thought I was kidding when I said he's got a graduate from astronaut school some people took it
04:18:06.96 --> 04:18:13.60 as me saying I'm not going to have some guy that's not even graduated from astronaut school
04:18:13.60 --> 04:18:20.24 in the podcast he needs to graduate first and I had to go back and explain no I'm just saying you know
04:18:20.24 --> 04:18:27.92 he's under the protocols of NASA and I think it worked out just so that I can speak more
04:18:27.92 --> 04:18:32.72 intelligently about the things that we do in NASA and also like the last thing you want to do
04:18:32.72 --> 04:18:37.36 when he's show up as in due guys somewhere is about like you're an expert at something right
04:18:37.36 --> 04:18:44.08 I mean that's just completely inconsistent with our ethos yeah well I'm glad that we waited
04:18:46.32 --> 04:18:49.28 so glad that you're able to come on and know this is the first interview that you've done
04:18:49.28 --> 04:18:53.68 you probably have a ton more I appreciate you you hold them out because it took us a little time
04:18:53.68 --> 04:18:59.20 to get this coordinated it's an honor for me to have you on here so thanks for coming on and more
04:18:59.20 --> 04:19:06.88 important you know obviously thank you for everything that you did for me for for task
04:19:06.88 --> 04:19:15.52 university or everything you did for the teams everything that you have done and are continuing
04:19:15.52 --> 04:19:24.24 to do for the Navy for NASA and for our great nation it's an honor to know you and thanks for coming
04:19:24.24 --> 04:19:32.08 on man you're welcome and the same goes back to you so thank you for teaching us what it means
04:19:32.08 --> 04:19:42.16 to be a warrior to be a follower a leader to be humble and for caring and loving the men you
04:19:42.16 --> 04:19:49.68 served with long after we've served together it's a relationship I've always been appreciative
04:19:50.40 --> 04:19:58.24 of and I know that at any time I could call you and ask you for help just like I can call any
04:19:58.24 --> 04:20:06.32 number of our teammates and they would drop everything to be there yes indeed brother that's it
04:20:06.32 --> 04:20:17.20 that's what it is thanks for coming on man and with that Johnny Kim has left the building
04:20:21.20 --> 04:20:29.60 not much to say after that one pretty awesome yes and you know a lot of times people they make
04:20:29.60 --> 04:20:36.40 um little comments about Johnny Kim on social media even though he he's not on social media but
04:20:36.40 --> 04:20:42.000 they make comments about him and what they say is something along the lines of
04:20:43.60 --> 04:20:54.000 Navy Zale Harvard Doctor astronaut yes I'm a loser you know everyone feels bad because they
04:20:54.000 --> 04:21:00.48 haven't done as much as Johnny Kim much under achievers bunch of under achievers now look we may not
04:21:01.52 --> 04:21:09.84 be able to become a seal or a doctor or an astronaut right those are some good goals maybe a
04:21:09.84 --> 04:21:21.12 little bit lofty for for an everyday jack like myself that being said maybe we could make some
04:21:21.12 --> 04:21:28.96 goals maybe we could try to become a little bit better in our lives I think that's a I think that's
04:21:28.96 --> 04:21:36.96 a solid thing to do do you agree I agree just like Johnny Kim said on the worry kid podcast because he was
04:21:36.96 --> 04:21:45.12 a guess on there as well giant leaps are done with small steps yeah which is a fitting quote you know
04:21:45.12 --> 04:21:54.80 you guys the whole small step for man giant leap for mankind right so Johnny has confirmed that
04:21:55.52 --> 04:22:01.68 now what I would like to say I think that there are some kind of small steps that we can take in life
04:22:03.28 --> 04:22:09.20 to sort of start moving in the right direction in a powerful direction just what do you think
04:22:09.20 --> 04:22:17.92 well I think among many things we want to stay fit we want to stay capable and strong fit strong
04:22:17.92 --> 04:22:23.52 capable agree that's that's a good bench what do we want to have mental clarity mental clarity yes
04:22:23.52 --> 04:22:29.60 okay good yeah any suggestions on yes those arenas so let's start with your jiu-jitsu we do jiu-jitsu
04:22:29.60 --> 04:22:38.96 yes we do yes sir we can't not do jiu-jitsu it's hard not to jiu-jitsu look you can not do jiu-jitsu
04:22:38.96 --> 04:22:45.52 but you're much better off in every spectrum of your life if you do do jiu-jitsu yes sir so let's do
04:22:45.52 --> 04:22:50.40 jiu-jitsu yeah so well you got to see in the game right you're doing ghee you're doing no ghee
04:22:50.40 --> 04:22:55.84 great both best when you're doing ghee you get an origin ghee that's the kind of ghee you get
04:22:55.84 --> 04:23:01.36 no one asked me that anymore I'm glad that means like we know the words out the word is out so we're
04:23:01.36 --> 04:23:08.000 going to maintain that word origin ghee factually factually the best ghee's happened to be made in America
04:23:08.000 --> 04:23:13.20 you know some people have thrown that as being kind of like one of your words that you use what factually
04:23:15.04 --> 04:23:19.20 cool yeah i mean i'm gonna say factually you do use that word like a thing
04:23:19.20 --> 04:23:26.32 it's actually two we act well nonetheless yes origin main dot com is where you can get your ghee
04:23:27.84 --> 04:23:33.20 for that's you jiu-jitsu you're gonna do no ghee there's rash cards on there as well for also for
04:23:33.20 --> 04:23:38.40 that's you jiu-jitsu also for that's you jiu-jitsu or other things you know also if you're not
04:23:38.40 --> 04:23:44.40 doing jiu-jitsu you're taking a break you know or you're doing some social distancing or something like this
04:23:44.40 --> 04:23:50.40 you know whatever the case may be no worries we got some other stuff on there to wear is what
04:23:50.40 --> 04:23:57.76 government wise garment wise yes body covering items sure yeah as it were uh jeans
04:23:58.80 --> 04:24:05.76 to be more specific so two two uh what uh models de calm models yeah i think so yeah

04:24:47.76 --> 04:24:55.12 for combat and they went to good old fashioned blue jeans and so in their honor we have a little
04:24:55.12 --> 04:25:01.12 some called the delta 68 jeans and so they're a little lighter weight because they're for the
04:25:01.12 --> 04:25:07.44 jungle by the way but they are flexible because we didn't just we didn't go to a lullsco

04:31:48.000 --> 04:31:57.04 the grounded podcast which is about life kind of through the lens of the GJ2 we have the
04:31:57.04 --> 04:32:05.60 Warrior Kid podcast which we have a new one up which is outstanding we have also speaking of Warrior
04:32:05.60 --> 04:32:11.68 Kids we have a Warrior Kid soap from Irish Oaks Ranch dot com young maiden making soap and
04:32:11.68 --> 04:32:17.60 right now he's making something called killer scopes killer soap and there's one thing one mission
04:32:17.60 --> 04:32:27.12 for that soap and that is to help you stay clean great action myself and he's three by the way
04:32:27.12 --> 04:32:32.72 he likes a killer soap it's black to say it's not abrasive it but it has the little like
04:32:32.72 --> 04:32:37.76 slight scrubbing quality in there's a slight scrubbing that's something yes would it be
04:32:37.76 --> 04:32:43.84 would it be considered exfoliating no I don't know the criteria I don't think so but it does I know
04:32:43.84 --> 04:32:50.000 your talking it has a little bit yeah a little not much not a little bit make you feel cleaner
04:32:50.000 --> 04:32:55.68 100% there you go yeah plus it's black by the way did I mention that yeah it looks kind of dope
04:32:56.80 --> 04:33:02.000 the fact that you use something that is black that you'd think oh this is gonna make everything dirty
04:33:02.000 --> 04:33:07.04 but it actually makes you clean is is like you're working with a handheld miracle
04:33:07.04 --> 04:33:14.48 it's a modern medical medical medical it's that activated charcoal yeah I seen a
04:33:14.48 --> 04:33:18.56 I don't know what it was like an Instagram video or something like this where activated
04:33:18.56 --> 04:33:23.76 charcoal they're using it like in something to brush their teeth so I was like hey I don't know
04:33:23.76 --> 04:33:29.12 what all that but apparently you know yeah we used to use it to prevent us from being killed by
04:33:29.12 --> 04:33:35.28 chemical biological and radiological weapons activated charcoal so why not wash your body with it
04:33:35.28 --> 04:33:41.12 there you go seems like good idea to me so there you go seems to work also we do have a YouTube channel
04:33:42.08 --> 04:33:45.28 with a video version of this podcast we want to see what Johnny Kim looks like
04:33:47.20 --> 04:33:54.88 see how young he looks you know it's watch YouTube video of it I think the YouTube is starting to
04:33:54.88 --> 04:34:00.16 become kind of like a more popular way of watching the podcast or well should I say uh
04:34:00.16 --> 04:34:04.40 what do you call listening to it or whatever well if you're on YouTube then you are in back watching it
04:34:04.40 --> 04:34:08.88 yeah I guess maybe you could be like have it on the in the background yeah like in the big
04:34:08.88 --> 04:34:12.80 screen or you know help you you know smart TVs nowadays that's the that's the jam nowadays
04:34:13.20 --> 04:34:18.32 you can have it on that whatever the last we do have YouTube channel official verified all that
04:34:18.32 --> 04:34:21.60 stuff so that's how you can tell it's a real one because there's you know people that'll
04:34:21.60 --> 04:34:25.68 cut they'll chop up little chunks and they'll put it on their YouTube channels everyone's in a while
04:34:25.68 --> 04:34:30.000 but tell you know you got the correct one the jockel podcast YouTube channel because there's excerpts
04:34:30.000 --> 04:34:35.84 on there as well enhanced excerpts with fire and smoke and explosions everyone's in a while yeah
04:34:35.84 --> 04:34:43.28 because what is what good is a good is a you know the spoken word if nothing's blowing up
04:34:43.28 --> 04:34:47.52 they know that's true it's all I feel sometimes true I didn't know if you were going to make it
04:34:47.52 --> 04:34:51.84 through today I fought for a moment you're going to make it through today without bringing in some random
04:34:51.84 --> 04:34:58.64 sci-fi movie episode the one time you spoke up you went straight to just Armageddon movie
04:34:58.64 --> 04:35:03.52 bro I was about to bust out interstellar Armageddon a deep impact like this a bunch of
04:35:03.52 --> 04:35:09.04 I was super nervous coming in this podcast because of that I'm like this could be hard I don't know
04:35:09.04 --> 04:35:13.60 if he's gonna be able to contain himself this could just turn into a sci-fi movie discussion and he
04:35:13.60 --> 04:35:19.92 mentioned Mars where that's the next mission so bro Mars what are we doing up there we all
04:35:19.92 --> 04:35:27.12 applaud you for containing your emotions and not turning this into a sci-fi movie discussion
04:35:27.12 --> 04:35:32.88 but I think I think there's a lot of questions that you know we all want to answer the last

04:38:20.96 --> 04:38:24.56 that juggle willing again thanks once again to Johnny Kim for coming on thanks for NASA
04:38:25.28 --> 04:38:31.20 for letting him come out and do this and thanks to him for being such a humble guy and setting such a great
04:38:31.20 --> 04:38:39.68 example such a great example for everyone listen to what he's overcome what he's done what he's
04:38:39.68 --> 04:38:45.92 doing and what he has done not only in his personal life but what he has done in the service
04:38:46.72 --> 04:38:54.72 of his country and in the service of his friends and his brothers and the same goes to the rest of
04:38:54.72 --> 04:39:03.84 our service men and women out there on sea air land and in space preserving freedom

04:39:19.28 --> 04:39:26.000 and secret service thanks to what you all do every day as well and the sacrifices you make
04:39:26.72 --> 04:39:35.12 to protect us here at home and everyone else out there there are so many things that you can do
04:39:38.32 --> 04:39:45.36 so many things that you can do and as Johnny Kim proves you can be humble and you can be helpful
04:39:45.36 --> 04:39:51.76 as you do those things and in fact the more humble you are the more help for you are
04:39:54.000 --> 04:40:00.80 the better you will do and that being said humility is no guarantee for success
04:40:02.88 --> 04:40:08.24 because while yes you have to be humble yes still have to set some serious goals
04:40:08.24 --> 04:40:16.72 then you have to work harder than you think is possible and no matter where you came from
04:40:18.40 --> 04:40:25.68 and no matter what's ahead of you and no matter what happens keep getting after it
