It's not that kind of war I mean this the you know the example that you just used about you know getting to her body and You know expecting to contact the enemy and night and do everything like the one thing that I learned about frogmen or least You know this modern you know interpretation of them is They're gonna adapt to find the enemy and this is one instance where we don't and we we almost are the the seal team is almost You know got turned turned away at the front door And Barnes comes in like you said you know he finds that there's nothing that they've trained for And their and his response you know not not really you know not not having ever done this before or not having you know any real It's a really apparently compelling you know myth I don't know why because you know Kennedy dies in November of 63 the seal team is our established in January of 62 and If there's anything that we learn you know in the preceding chapters of this book is that you know all of these units They could have been you know killed in the crib you know They could have you know strangled the death and an infancy or smothered You know by a pillow is how I describe it like these all of these units could have been you know Dispanted How do you find these groups and You know soviet societies or societies where you know you have a an aggressive You know Gestapo type police force you know you don't have a free society like and the only place that you're going to find You know a ready pool of candidates to you know join a thing like this is and You know sort of ungoverned spaces where there aren't you know these You know state police secret police what's the deal with yarboros daughter? but they are you know two a man they are You know they all express you know how pleased they are that you know Bob's Contribution you know Bob Gallagher who's you never Never you know Toud of it is on achievements I mean if anybody's going to you know Capture the you know the attention of that era I mean that should be him Is it an interesting thing about him too that I mean he like I say he's the anti So now all I'm only was trying to do is just kind of one you know Further solidify you know how that had happened and you know I discovered some stuff along the way like you know the The night or the night the vision being heck of you know the night one of the the most interesting things to you know show You know how the the Navy had become you know So when The leadership at Seal team one is trying to you know adapt you know their naval commando force to be You know to have more you know hard army skills who do they turn to you know outside of you know their traditional Avenue for support with you know the Ranger school and things like that they turn to a former soldier guy stone guy stone sets up a curriculum It gets smart on all of his old army Manuels and he sets up training for seal team one and starts putting all the guys through it before they're going to be a nom they got to go through guys stones course and they finally tell us you know about face start marching to the ocean we start backing up Guys are getting online, you know You know putting fins on Pete's having you know a little bit of a tough time getting those those fins on I'm starting to see the the line you know kind of edge away from us a little bit like We're starting to be like all right we're in Peter starting to get left behind here a little bit like I'm starting to wonder You know the waves are pretty big for Florida. I mean wars changing at this point so you know the the sort of the The the the chapter structure that I had settled on in World War II and the Korean War you know Where I focus on one main Operations kind of gone at this point in the book because you know there's no one there's so many battles that are a Carrier so many little small skirmishes but you know I focus on yarboros because he's the person who He creates the special war fair center or the the schoolhouse for green berets um and and marries you know the green berets to this this new Operation of counterinsurgency so there's no more commando operations for the special forces No rating or anything like that. So they they present this whole problem to them bucklo Appeals to the commander of Macvee's Understanding of the naval tradition of leadership Change the leader you're gonna change the rest of the organization so Barnes has removed After buckloos intercession and an entire new detachment replaces That Delta that is deck golf and deck golf the commander of deck golf is Juner officer by the name of of main requires comes in and Completely over halls what the seals are doing not over halls the mission Because you know the mission up to that point and really just been to You can go out into you know the country set ambushes where you could you know see if you could find the enemy Although they hadn't had any success but just because they hadn't had success Wires doesn't say that you know that's an excuse like I said you know in the book his His message to his man at the time was this is the only war in town. It's you know, it's still controversial like You know the navy like I said the navy hadn't been involved in a war like that for Over over a hundred years Um, sir, Shane it's controversial because of that it's controversial because he's advocating for you know this this this this river reenforce This this force that's going to take us away from the blue water away from you know the navy's emphasis at that point which is aircraft and air care and and aircraft carriers and And nuclear subs and everything like that you're you're I I I spent you know a long time a long time trying to figure out where that transition had occurred You know that transition from Where the seal platoons were you know Patrol and ambushers to you know capture kill commandos and you know Marcinto he makes all these claims and his you know Rogue warrior buck That it was his platoon that was the eighth platoon that made that transition but you know the marine core deciding that they aren't gonna fight in the Mecon Delta And the the marine force recon deciding that they're going to support special forces on the on the CIDG camps and then the marine core deciding well, we don't really it's too risky to have those guys out there at the CIDG camps We're gonna keep them with the divisions then it's about the the lurps or the the creation of reconsons Troops to support the divisions whether it's the you know project Delta with the green berets or whether it's the the lurps with the individual Divisions both of these units are you know there they look like seals they probably act like seals They probably would have had the same sorts of missions as seals, you know in different parts of the country to go out find the enemy He left the seal t's one of the last things he did he took a Commission Which no I don't know that anybody I He took a commission as a as a warn officer I'm one of the first things he did was he or he had to leave the seal themes he had to go to an aircraft carrier and And work on this aircraft carrier with fleet sailors and Every but every seal that he ever met afterwards he To a man he told them it was one of the things he was most proud of he was able to see you know the US Navy at work And see how committed you know the is fellow shipmates and sailors were you know they weren't seals Maybe these guys couldn't you know couldn't couldn't run and couldn't do the things that frog men can do But you know the emphasis of all of the divisions is to get these main these big forces into combat with the enemy so all they send them these guys out to do It's fine the enemy tells where he is and we'll send guys to you I mean, it's it doesn't work because you know, it's Vietnam and they you know small pockets of enemies You know if you don't contact them if you don't you know engage them whether they're 499 times you know, I think a lot of it was just because I mean You know some of the things that are said, you know They're talking about this you know this revolution That's that's undergoing With naval warfare that's about to you know undergoes naval warfare But I mean I found the seven platoon because I was just methodically going through these platoon You know platoon at a time operation by at a time and I noticed in the seven pltunes, you know this They started out like everybody else you know they they got to you know via nom and they would get a little bit of intel and they would go out They said in ambush. And I knew the point that I was trying to make so at least I had the you know the bones of the chapter the structure was good You know whether or not I was gonna come back and add stuff on you know the The Cuban frog men or something like that or um Gosh Where are you leaning towards your next book you must be must have an idea in that I have an idea It's very private Private all right, you know, no one's gonna steal it every idea is I is not that because no one has enough time and I've fortunately Through a lot of counseling Through some distance from the book I've been able to you know take a take a pause I kind of gave myself you know mentally a year You know from the data publication Until you know so for a year so July 20th when it came out I'm giving myself till July 20th of 2022 before I really start you know buckling down or start beating myself up about what's next It was tough to find the character and this I always tried to you know When I was working on a chapter working on a different unit I was always trying to find you know one you know the operation that was You know most consequential to driving you know that missions either success or failure They're their their continuation I mean Like the thing that never you know ceases to amaze me is the fact that the Seal teams Were the recipient of all of that accumulated knowledge of all that All that legacy you know Darby's legacy in the Kabanato and legacy in the point to hawk all that You know all that knowledge got compressed into the Ranger School and There are no Rangers so the Seal teams became the biggest You know collection of Ranger School graduates in the US military But his his ability to you know You use everything all the all the tools that he has and his personality everything from straight force I mean he in the course of his Creation of the PR you camp lots of different entities come into trying to steal this from him and he uses a variety of Ways to keep them out one you just threatens to kick their ass to He you know like I say in the book he threatens just you know pack up his bags and go home Which you know convinces the CIA planners to push everybody else aside he no questions asked That's a That's that's an attitude that stuck through you know till this day something's going on like that we're going I mean and Whatever I don't know if it was pulled from you know the sea wolves, but I mean we we saw it carry through I mean in our time I mean the Seal team ten
