00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jocco podcast number 269 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening echo.

2
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:12.000
Good evening and also joining us tonight is Dave Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The last podcast with Lave we covered the first part of this Marine Corps manual, which I don't even know if it's not really a manual.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's like somebody made this. It's called the squad leader makes a difference and I know who made it actually. Lieutenant M. M. Abalday and Lieutenant A. M. Attaro.

5
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
They made it at the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab in August of 1998.

6
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And we're going to push through the last few pages of this book that we didn't cover last time, but then we're going to dive deeper into the last example, which I actually moved to the end.

7
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And if you've ever wondered where these podcasts come from, where my mind is going, if you've ever wondered how I'm thinking through these things, this is an opportunity to follow me down a path of discovery.

8
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.000
To learn more about leadership, to learn more about human nature and about war and about history and about fear and about sorrow and about life and about death.

9
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's an interesting ride.

10
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And it all starts by picking up where we left off with this manual.

11
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The squad leader makes a difference. The subtitle is readings on combat at the squad level.

12
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This book is a book that by its very nature simultaneously establishes and then reinforces a culture of maneuver warfare.

13
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It enforces that, it establishes it.

14
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It is decentralized command. It's literally a book about the front line leaders making a difference and stepping up and leading.

15
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So, here we go. We're going to go back to the book right now.

16
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This one is Sergeant Joe Hooper, US Army Vietnam 1968.

17
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Sergeant Joe Hooper was a squad leader with D company, second battalion, five hundred and first infantry, hundred and first airborne division, near Way City.

18
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Big salute right now, obviously, to the second of the 50 first.

19
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
In January of 1968, Way was captured by the North Vietnamese in the Ted offensive. US forces fought desperately deliberate.

20
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Vietnam's ancient Imperial City on February 17, D company was assaulting a defended position along a riverbank outside Way City when it was attacked by rocket and machine gun fire.

21
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
The company had run into a defensive position, manned by two North Vietnamese companies in dugout bunkers.

22
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
With the company pinned down by fire, Sergeant Hooper located the source of the enemy fire. He rallied his squad and attacked across the river.

23
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
He overran several enemy bunkers. This bold maneuver inspired the rest of the company to join the attack.

24
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
During this attack, some of Sergeant Hooper squad had been wounded.

25
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
He ran out into the open to retrieve them, but was seriously wounded himself.

26
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Sergeant Hooper refused medical treatment and returned to his men. Enemy fire continued to hamper the attack.

27
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Sergeant Hooper led his squad through the bunkers and buildings clearing a path for the company and mortally wounding a North Vietnamese officer.

28
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:56.000
When his squad came under direct fire from a building to their front, Sergeant Hooper assaulted the building himself and killed the enemy with grenades and rifle fire.

29
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Upon reaching the final line of the North Vietnamese defenses, Sergeant Hooper destroyed fire bunkers by running the length of the position tossing grenades into each of the dugouts.

30
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The enemy soldiers began to withdraw from their positions.

31
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Sergeant Hooper then led his squad in destroying the last two Vietnamese bunkers with white phosphorus grenades.

32
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
After the last pocket of resistance was eliminated, Sergeant Hooper organized his unit into defensive positions.

33
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
When the remainder of his company caught up, Sergeant Hooper allowed himself to have his wounds treated.

34
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Sergeant Hooper played a major role in defeating a large force of North Vietnamese.

35
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:50.000
D-Company's attack forced the withdrawal of North Vietnamese reinforcements attempting to enter the city. This action outside the city weakened the NVA defenders inside way.

36
00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Easing pressure on the besieged city and leading to the eventual liberation of the Imperial capital.

37
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
In oddly enough, it doesn't talk about him receiving the metal of honor or anything after he's charging bunkers by himself.

38
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
This is just who?

39
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I guess that's just what we're doing.

40
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Lessons, Sergeant Hooper displayed exceptional leadership. His endurance despite being wounded served as an example to his squad and his company.

41
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
After taking initiative to assault across the river Sergeant Hooper squad assumed the role of the company's main effort and spearheaded the attack.

42
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
His exceptional courage under fire inspired the remainder of the company.

43
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Sergeant Hooper's combat decisions and tactical leadership at the squad level contributed to his company's success in this better fight.

44
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
With the North Vietnamese attempt to reinforce the city halted other forces were able to clear the city.

45
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:05.000
This is obviously the kind of initiative. This is the kind of bias for action that the Marine Corps talks about all the time.

46
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
This is the kind of initiative that we try and train leaders to have at every level.

47
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
But they are going to make things happen.

48
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That's what we want.

49
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And they followed up this quote. I've actually, we actually hit this quote before, but I'm going to hit it again.

50
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We covered it a while ago on podcast 62, Ardent De Peake, his book Battle Studies.

51
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Listen to this though. Listen to this and think about this.

52
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Four brave men who do not know each other will not dare to attack a lion.

53
00:06:45.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Four less brave men, but knowing each other well, sure of their reliability and consequently of mutual aid will attack resolute me.

54
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
There is the science of the organization of armies in a nutshell.

55
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000
When I was in South Africa, late in the South Africa, we worked with some companies down there.

56
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
But they were talking about how back in the day the African tribes would hunt lions with spears.

57
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000
But they would say, you know, be like three or four guys that would be able to take a lion because they could maneuver in from different angles and they could eventually kill the lion.

58
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And this was after the conversation that I don't know if you know this in South Africa.

59
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000
There's no lions living out in the wild. They're all in these big giant gamers' nerves, which are like the wild, but they're not in the wild.

60
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Why is that? Because then you have freaking lions roaming around, killing people. I mean, you're no match for a lion. No match.

61
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But if you got some friends, three friends, I mean, if you think about the, okay, what are the odds if you were to do this?

62
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The odds of a human beating a lion in a fight? What are the odds? What do you know? Like it is not, it's almost zero.

63
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
How is it? How is a human going to kill a lion in a fight? Right? Okay.

64
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Okay, you give him a spear. He has some kind of a chance. But it ain't good when a freaking lion's coming at you.

65
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:43.000
That thing's going to, just, it's a slaughter. But as soon as you got some friends, and you can make some maneuvers, now you can not only can you win, you are confident enough that you do it on a regular basis.

66
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000
That's decentralized command. That's not only decentralized command. That's what a good team is. A good team was he calling it.

67
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000
If you're sure of the mutual aid, if I know you got my back, that's the strength of the team.

68
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I like how he used the phrase in that quote, the science of organizations.

69
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And you think of science, I think of like all this research and all this analysis and all the things, you know what the science of organizations is?

70
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I got relationships. I got your back. That's the science. That's all you need to know.

71
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I think that quote, that word actually, I wrote that down, because that that run loudly of, there's actually it's not complicated.

72
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
This is not complicated. You have to have someone that you trust.

73
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
If you trust that person, you'll do so much more with just one other person that you trust than what you do as a on your own.

74
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Yeah, and before I jumped on and completed your sentence for you, you were going to say relationships, right?

75
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And I was already in the combat mode if I got your back, because that's, you know, what do you, you don't, you don't tell a, a Lance Corpel.

76
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Hey, you need to build a relationship. Now you say, you got to make sure they got your back, right?

77
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But if you're talking to a business, which is what we do, it's hey, you got to make sure you're building good relationships.

78
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
You got to make sure that they know they're going to give you that support, that mutual aid if you need it. That's what we're doing.

79
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And if we have that, we're unstoppable. If we have that, three of us can take a lion.

80
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Corpel Gregory.

81
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Corpel Gregory was a squad leader. This is Vietnam 1971, US Marine Corps.

82
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Corpel Gregory was a squad leader assigned to the first combined unit pacification platoon, third battalion, first Marines.

83
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:48.000
The unit was the northern most marine unit in Vietnam. Corpel Gregory's combat experience had made him an extremely proficient infantry leader.

84
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
He placed strong emphasis on training in the field.

85
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Where? Wait, back in the rear? Were they at plenty of time to train? No, in the field. He placed strong emphasis on training in the field.

86
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
He took every chance to conduct opportunity training with his Marines.

87
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
There were numerous duties required of Corpel Gregory squad.

88
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Each day, Corpel Gregory assembled the squad and instructed them in a single practical infantry skill.

89
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I'm gonna say that again. Every day, well, we got all these duties.

90
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
The reason I'm saying this is, we hear this all the time from companies. We don't really have time to train. So, so guess what? No one has time to train.

91
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And if you think that this Marine Corpel in the field has, quote, time to train, you're wrong.

92
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So what does he do? Every day he assembles the squad and instructs them in a single practical infantry skill.

93
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
How long does that take? 10 minutes, five minutes, seven minutes.

94
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
While in a patrol base, Corpel Gregory instructed his men in such skills as helicopter medevacs,

95
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Closer support and call for fire.

96
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Corpel Gregory required that his squad members continue their professional development.

97
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Every day after returning from patrols, Corpel Gregory squad would work on their Marine Corps Institute correspondence courses.

98
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:19.000
PFC Kirby, a member of Corporal Gregory Squad, finished the Marine Corps NCO MCI in the field in Vietnam.

99
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:29.000
In the field in Vietnam, Corporal Gregory took the initiative to train his Marines in the skills required by his units mission and environment.

100
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000
His training exceeded the basic requirements established by the Marine Corps and created a squad that was particularly well prepared for combat.

101
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:47.000
The Corpel used scenario-based training to run his men through multiple repetitions of probable combat situations.

102
00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:00.000
He made sure that each Marine in his squad understood their commanders intent, their role in the mission, and how each man affected the outcome of events during battle.

103
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Corporal Gregory is freaking square away.

104
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
By the way, everything that I'm saying right now, apply it to what you're doing in your company, in your business.

105
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Think of how much you could do to help, how much you could do to train your people.

106
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Not because you've got two weeks allocated to train your personnel, but because you've got 20 minutes to review with them how this product works or how this piece of equipment functions or what to do in an emergency situation.

107
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Or how to handle a client.

108
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It was not long before Corporal Gregory's training proved vital.

109
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:48.000
On the night of February 14, 1971, Corporal Gregory and his unit came under heavy attack.

110
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Corporal Gregory was killed.

111
00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Yet, because the squad was so well trained and understood what it had, what had to be done, the squad was able to meet the challenge and skillfully engage the enemy.

112
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Corporal Gregory's exemplary leadership in the weeks prior to the attack at prepared his Marines for this firefight.

113
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
The enemy was repulsed and the squad held its position.

114
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:32.000
In the morning, over 30 dead NVA were found in the area surrounding the squad's position, every Marine in the squad realized that it was Corporal Gregory's training emphasis that had won the battle and saved their lives.

115
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Lessons. Corporal Gregory displayed outstanding initiative in training his Marines.

116
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
He assumed the responsibility for preparing his Marines for the demands of combat.

117
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000
This training greatly exceeded the established standards of the Marine Corps, which by the way are no low standards.

118
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And directly contributed to the combat success and survival of the unit after Corporal Gregory's death.

119
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Corporal Gregory, and by the way, if they ended up with 30 dead NVA, over 30 dead NVA, that was a big force that attacked his unit.

120
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Corporal Gregory used whatever time was available to instruct his Marines and hone their professional skills.

121
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
This aggressive opportunity training was necessary because few units could conduct formal training in the combat zone.

122
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I talked about this on the F online the other day.

123
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I absolutely learned more from informal training than I did from formal training during my time in the Navy without questions.

124
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Not even close.

125
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
If you were to remove all the informal lessons I learned, I would be an idiot.

126
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Do you find that the formal training is like kind of sorts itself out to be more valuable early on?

127
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Explain.

128
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So like, you know how you have basic training, right?

129
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
That's where you learn like all the formal protocols that were everyone has to essentially do the same thing under very similar circumstances.

130
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And then the informal training seems to, and I'm totally just thinking about you, just to know.

131
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And it work I guess, where when you get informal training, that's when you're trained up on all the basics.

132
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
It's kind of like college in a way, you know, you have like all these prerequisites.

133
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Like hey, you guys all got to know this, this, this, this and know it good.

134
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And then later on, then maybe we'll send you out to a specific company or whatever to learn kind of what they do.

135
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And then you can start to apply these things in specific situations.

136
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I think the example to use would be let's say you went to some kind of a technical school like being a doctor, being a mechanic, being a air conditioning repairman.

137
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
You're going to learn some technical stuff in the classroom, but when you really get good, it's doing the job.

138
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
It's when someone pulls your side and says, oh yeah, when you see this, here's the problem.

139
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Right.

140
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
When you when you go here, here's what you need to do.

141
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
You see this symptom from a patient, here's what's actually happening.

142
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:20.000
It's all that informal training that and maybe I'm wrong about the doctors because I don't know what medical schools like, but I can only imagine that you get a heck of a lot better.

143
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
By once you're in the field and you're doing surgeries and someone says, hey, here's a better way to do this.

144
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Here's the technique and you do this there. Here's something like that.

145
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Yeah.

146
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Yeah.

147
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000
It's like, you know, I think it was, it was a book you're reading a long time ago where they'd have a name.

148
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Should it might have been one of our guests, I don't know, but they'd have a name for the people who don't do.

149
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
I think it was in the army where they don't do it. They just do all the theory and they call them something like nerds or something.

150
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Those, I don't know.

151
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Anyway, but yeah, there's a people who know and they essentially, they know what to do and what the protocols are in a vacuum.

152
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Once you start when you get out out there in the field and the real world kind of thing, that's where that informal like, no, this isn't by the book over here.

153
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
You've got to watch out for this because you know,

154
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And there's also a difference between just learning from experience, which is, hey, I did this operation.

155
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Here's something mistakes that I made and all and that's just experience classroom is classroom.

156
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I'm talking about in between where you're, you know, someone's pulling you inside and say, hey, Jonko,

157
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
when you start to see this develop, that's not a good call.

158
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Here's a call that would be better to make and here's why.

159
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
It's not formal training. It's my platoon chief telling me something.

160
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Yeah.

161
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
It's my LPO, my leading petty officer saying, hey, hey, new guy.

162
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Here's what you need to do when you see that unfolding.

163
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And you go, okay, Roger that. It's not formal training, but that's where you learn.

164
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And it's not just experience either.

165
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Experience alone would take you way longer than informal training.

166
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Like how many, okay, Jjitsu example, here you learn the armlock.

167
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Now we're rolling.

168
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Yeah.

169
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
And you try an armlock me and I say, hey, echo, if you, if you don't squeeze your knees together,

170
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
it's really easy to get out here.

171
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Put, look at me your arm, boom, oh yeah, you feel that.

172
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Try and pull your arm or oh, I can't. Okay, yeah.

173
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
That's because it's all because I'm squeezed my knees.

174
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Okay, look, the instructor guaranteed the instructor said squeeze your knees.

175
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Yeah.

176
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
But you need that informal assessment of your actual situation to realize,

177
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
oh, I see what I need to do.

178
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Yeah, exactly right. That's exactly what else I can do.

179
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Did you get it?

180
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
What was the, I mean, you have to get informal training once you're in the,

181
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
once you're done with the rag.

182
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Yeah.

183
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I think just how you described it.

184
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
The, you talked about like being on cider being in the field or doing it like that.

185
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
You talked about even just the interconnection of repair man.

186
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
What that looks like.

187
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
The way you described what life would be like if all we ever did was formal training,

188
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
you'd have no context for anything.

189
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
You wouldn't even know how it applies.

190
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
So I think that's true.

191
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And certainly in my case, in aviation,

192
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I don't think it's any different.

193
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Like everything is taught by the book.

194
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Everything is formal training the beginning.

195
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
It's all these things.

196
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And the many you get in the airplane and get up in the sky.

197
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And you are feeling things in a different way.

198
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
It's really hard to apply them because you learned it on the ground.

199
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And the context of the informal, hey, hey listen, look,

200
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
you see that? Yeah.

201
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
That's what it means in the book when it says this.

202
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
That's what it looks like.

203
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Oh, man, I would never be able to understand that from reading it in a book.

204
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
They have to train.

205
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
You have to get a translation.

206
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Yeah.

207
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
You do.

208
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
You have to be able to see and feel it.

209
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And that will not happen in formal training.

210
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
It's important to realize if you have some experience.

211
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And you have people that are on your team.

212
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
The amount of knowledge that you can transfer to them is so valuable.

213
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And the reason I'm pointing this out is because a lot of times you forget that.

214
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
You think you can do this for a long time.

215
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
You think it's a big deal.

216
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Hey, this is just what you do.

217
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
You forget that you've learned all this.

218
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
But taking that and saying, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

219
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
now come over here.

220
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Let me show you some.

221
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Let me show you better way to do that.

222
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Let me show you a little trick.

223
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
It's very powerful.

224
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Not to mention when you invest in people like that for 10 minutes.

225
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
For 10 minutes.

226
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
You're helping them.

227
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
And you're building that relationship.

228
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Which is what this whole thing is that we're talking about.

229
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Yeah.

230
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And I wrote down while you're talking that telling that story of that corporal is.

231
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I just wrote down.

232
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I always take notes.

233
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
It's all I do in this podcast.

234
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I just take notes.

235
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
I take these things.

236
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I write them down and I keep them.

237
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And I find places where they apply.

238
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
And as you know, they apply everywhere.

239
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And this idea of this guy training is people is actually the best thing he can do to take care of them.

240
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
It's the best thing he can do.

241
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
It's the best thing any leader can do to help them.

242
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Not give you a break and not give you free time.

243
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And yeah, of course there's a balance there.

244
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
But the best thing he could do is prepare them to be in a position.

245
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And I think the reason that stuck with me is that when we talk about decentralized command, which we talk about all the time,

246
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
when business.

247
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
The scenario that always plays out is the reason why decentralized command is so important is that your people have to know what to do when you're not around.

248
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
That's pretty obvious.

249
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
But the scenarios are usually your on vacation.

250
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
You're on a different shift.

251
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
You've got the day off.

252
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Not that you're dead.

253
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
So when you kind of think of it in these context that these of what he was doing is being able to prepare them to be successful.

254
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
That him being around is in the worst possible situation.

255
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
If literally him dying in that situation is the best thing he can do.

256
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
So so the same thing doesn't happen to them is train them.

257
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Even if it's five minutes at a time.

258
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
That's how we kept those guys alive.

259
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
And that is something that you can you can translate to almost any situation.

260
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
You're family.

261
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
You know we talk about this in the code, the protocol.

262
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
The evaluation.

263
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
It's like hey, what can you do your family?

264
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Can you give your family five minutes of training to pass on knowledge that you have?

265
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
More lessons here.

266
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Corporal Gregory realized that combat is a dynamic environment which takes a heavy toll on leaders within an infantry company.

267
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
He trained his subordinates to be able to assume his role.

268
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
This saved the lives of his men during the chaos of battle.

269
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:28.000
After his death the men of corporal Gregory squad performed well performed well because they had confidence in their training and in themselves a confidence that was instilled by corporal Gregory's leadership.

270
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You know when we were talking when we talk about confidence how do you get confidence?

271
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
You confidence to work.

272
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
You know when we talk about confidence by doing something.

273
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
You know when we talk about confidence by doing something.

274
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Doing it well doing it again doing it better doing it better.

275
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
That's where confidence comes from.

276
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Otherwise it's false confidence.

277
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Maybe I should just stop talking because the way he that was written.

278
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Because a lot better than the way I said it.

279
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Well here's what's really cool.

280
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
So they have a if.

281
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
We he mentioned he mentioned Kirby in this PFC Kirby.

282
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Remember of the of corporal Gregory squad that finished this NCO MCI in the field.

283
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
We'll have a quote from him not from Vietnam from 1998.

284
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And now Sergeant Major RB Kirby said the very worst night of my torn Vietnam when we were involved in a major firefight and we were losing marines.

285
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Our squad survived as result of the corporal's training.

286
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
We are alive today because of him.

287
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Next one.

288
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Corporal Abolz British Army.

289
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Foculons.

290
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
1982.

291
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
In 1982 Argentina invaded the Foculons.

292
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Foculons in the South Pacific South Atlantic Ocean.

293
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
The island had been British territory since British days as an imperial power not willing to give up its territory.

294
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Britain sent a task force to the islands in order to reclaim them after an amphibious assault.

295
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
British forces pushed their way across the islands.

296
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:15.000
The second battalion of the parachute regiment known as two parah of the British Army was ordered to attack the Argentine forces of Goose Green.

297
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
It was to be the first pitched battle between British and Argentine forces.

298
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
The land bridge between Goose Green and the town of Darwin was the only way for forces to move between East Foculon Island.

299
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
And Lafonia Island.

300
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:39.000
If two parah could not break through to Goose Green, the British would have to spend valuable time mounting another amphibious assault of the Foculon Islands.

301
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Corporal Abolz was a section leader equivalent to a squad leader in a company to parah.

302
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
A company's mission was to attack along the battalion's eastern flank and assault the town of Darwin.

303
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
On the night of 27 May 1982, two parah attacked Goose Green.

304
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
The Argentineans were well prepared for the attack and the paratroopers could advance only yards at a time.

305
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
As the sun rose, the battalion was left in a precarious position.

306
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Two parah was stalled pin down in the open by Argentinean mortar and machine gunfire.

307
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000
A company was trapped in a crossfire between the Argentineans on Goose Green and those in Darwin.

308
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
This is a nightmare scenario.

309
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
You're in a crossfire receiving both mortar and machine gunfire.

310
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Realizing that the trap could only be broken by persistent aggressive action.

311
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Corporal Abolz decided to continue to lead his squad in assaulting enemy positions,

312
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
seeking to break the deadlock himself.

313
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
The commanding officer of two parah charged the machine gun nest.

314
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
And we shot dead.

315
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
The commander of a company kept the event quiet, not wanting to demoralize the troops,

316
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
whose predicament seemed to worsen at this critical point in the attack.

317
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
At that moment, Corporal Abolz led an assault upon an Argentinean position.

318
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
He decided to fire a 66-millimeter shoulder-launched anti-tank rock that into the bunker.

319
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
The penetration of this rocket caused such a magnificent explosion, which was followed by silence.

320
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
The first flags of surrender then began to surface from the Argentinean positions.

321
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
The Argentineans had been demoralized by the utter destruction of this single bunker

322
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
and the ruthlessness of Corporal Abolz resolved.

323
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
This allowed a company to turn its full attention toward Goose Green.

324
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Momentum gathered behind the British attack in the next 24 hours.

325
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
The parah opened the route to Lafonia Island.

326
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Corporal Abolz persist in aggressiveness had broken the will of the defenders.

327
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
This action proved to be pivotal in a company's attack to parah.

328
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Two parah's victory at Goose Green assured a British victory for the Falkland campaign.

329
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Lessons.

330
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Corporal Abolz squad level action effectively turned the tide of the battle at Goose Green.

331
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
This is an example of how an aggressive tactical action can have effects out of all proportion

332
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
to the size of the action.

333
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
His command decisions fully supported both his company and battalion commanders intent.

334
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000
His spectacular assault of that particular bunker affected the morale of both sides.

335
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Crush the spirit of the Argentineans and pass the initiative and momentum to British forces

336
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
and prove to be the action needed to continue the British advance.

337
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
After this action, Argentineans soldiers began to surrender rather than die in combat.

338
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000
One person, a corporal, makes a one move and it changes the tide of this battle.

339
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:54.000
By the way, moments after his commanding officer was killed, heroically assaulting a machine gun nest.

340
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Corporal Abolz courage leadership and determination propelled him to persevere and achieve decisive results in extricating his unit from a desperate situation.

341
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
When all else fails, persevere and prevails.

342
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
And if you want more on the Falkland Islands, podcast 88 excursion to hell.

343
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Sergeant David C. Freeman, US Army, Vietnam, 1966.

344
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:34.000
During Operation Crazy Horse and pay attention to that name, Operation Crazy Horse.

345
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
We're going to go deep.

346
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000
In the Vin van Valley in June of 1966, a company of Montenegro troops led by special forces

347
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
advisors, landed at LZ Monkey for a search and destroy mission.

348
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Sergeant Freeman, a member of the command element was the fourth senior man in the unit.

349
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Soon after landing, the company attacked and secured a bunker complex.

350
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
The company suffered some casualties and a helicopter met a vac was requested.

351
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
The company moved back to LZ Monkey with their wounded.

352
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
At the LZ, the company began receiving heavy, small arms fire.

353
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
The command element around Sergeant Freeman was devastated.

354
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
The situation demanded rapid action.

355
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Sergeant Freeman grabbed a radio and took command of the company.

356
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
He called and helicopter gunships, coordinated supporting arms, and reorganized his defenses.

357
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
The helicopter pilot's flying above the battle were amazed at his coolness, under fire,

358
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:33.000
under Sergeant Freeman's competent command, the perimeter held all night and the enemy eventually withdrew.

359
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Stepping up.

360
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Lessons, Sergeant Freeman, a well-trained NCO was prepared to lead his company in combat.

361
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
He knew the techniques and procedures for air support supporting arms, met a vac, and company defensive positions.

362
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And knew they kind of rattle that off.

363
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000
And one thing that the Marine Corps does really good in this manual is they hit on the fact that you got to have the skills.

364
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
You got to have these fundamental skills of combat leadership.

365
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
The technical and tactical skills of combat leadership, meaning how to call for air support,

366
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
how to call for supporting arms, how to call for artillery, how to call for met a vac.

367
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
These are technical skills that you have to have, and they reinforce that throughout this book.

368
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
So if you're in a leadership position, you think, well, I'm not going to have to do that.

369
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000
No, actually, you better go and dig in and figure out how to do these things.

370
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:36.000
In addition to his technical knowledge, he was able to match these abilities with strong leadership and cool competence in the face of disaster.

371
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Because of his experience and situational awareness, Sergeant Freeman knew that rapid action was required.

372
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Once again, what do we see? We see someone that's taking action.

373
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:57.000
He immediately took control of the situation, making decisions and issuing orders, and extricated his company from a perilous situation.

374
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And here's a little cloud squids on war, which we haven't covered yet.

375
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
It's sort of one of those ones.

376
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Is it like not playing the obvious one? You know, I haven't done that one yet.

377
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:29.000
The end for which a soldier is recruited, armed, and trained, the whole object of his sleeping eating, drinking, and marching is simply that he should fight at the right place, and at the right time.

378
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Check. All right. Now, here we go. Here we go.

379
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.000
So this section that I'm about to read actually came earlier in the manual. I pulled it out and I put it at the end.

380
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
This is the last one of these examples.

381
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
And there's a reason why. And it immediately struck me when I saw it.

382
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.000
So the title of this section is just Sergeant 1st class, US Army Vietnam, 1966.

383
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
So as soon as I read that, I was kind of surprised because I had all the other ones to give the person's name.

384
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Something in why why why aren't they saying this guy's name?

385
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
This is a top secret mission. Well, no, this is 1998. There was no no more secret missions.

386
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:24.000
So why aren't we explaining this? It becomes obvious when I read it why they just called this individual Sergeant 1st class. So here we go.

387
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:38.000
In May of 1966, C company of 1st Battalion, 12th Cavery, 1st Cavery Division established a mortgher fire base at LZ Harford in the Ving Fan Valley.

388
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
So this is actually part of and I'll get into this.

389
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
This is part of that earlier operation that we mentioned.

390
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:55.000
The position was 150 meters long and 40 meters wide. The upper slope was covered in six foot high elephant grass.

391
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
The mortgher section was led by a sergeant 1st class, no name given.

392
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000
His position lay on a hill which had previously been occupied by Vietcong Gorillos.

393
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
He formed his men in a weak perimeter.

394
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:22.000
We're not off to a good start. Arrange in a U shape with the curve facing uphill and set up the mortgher's in order to provide support for the company.

395
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000
The main body of the company went off to patrol the valley below leaving the 22 man mortar section to defend their own position.

396
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
The men fired off a few rounds to seat their base plates. The sergeant decided to give the men a break.

397
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
It did not order anyone to dig in or examine the area around the perimeter.

398
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:52.000
No security patrols were sent out. The men lounged, eight sea rations and walked around in the open.

399
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
In the jungle heat it seemed like a day at the beach.

400
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:06.000
At 1330 an enemy machine gun opened up at a range of 50 meters from the elephant grass uphill of the mortgher position.

401
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
A 200 man unit of VC had been waiting to ambush the laks mortar unit.

402
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Machine gun fire was followed by rifle fire and grenade attacks.

403
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
The rest of the company which had gone down the hill on patrol.

404
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
The rest of the company took 35 minutes to rush back to the devastated mortar position.

405
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
The enemy had withdrawn and left only a handful of dazed survivors.

406
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
The failure of the sergeant to properly lead his unit.

407
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:45.000
In force basic security measures or prepare for enemy contact led directly to disaster.

408
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
With its support element eliminated, the company was not able to establish its patrol mission,

409
00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:01.000
which in turn negatively affected the battalions mission in the Vin Tham Valley.

410
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000
I read that and I think about what is this mean.

411
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
They hadn't given away any names, right?

412
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
They didn't give this guy's name, but they had given away a date may of 1966.

413
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
They'd given away the lz, lz hair effort.

414
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:33.000
I started to do some research and it turns out that this battle, this specific battle,

415
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
was written about in a book on Vietnam called Battles in the Monsoon.

416
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
This is an outer print book, but I was really curious.

417
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
What happened?

418
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
What happened?

419
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
I found this outer book, print book, ordered it.

420
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:04.000
The book Battles in the Monsoon is a book full of basically a bunch of short little stories.

421
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:16.000
This particular section in this book about this battle is called Men Facing Death.

422
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:24.000
So let's hear a little bit more detail about this situation.

423
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
By the way, this is all Operation Crazy Horse.

424
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:37.000
By the night of 21 May, the Battle of Vin Tham Valley appeared to be slowing to a stop with the enemy fractionalized and everyone running for cover.

425
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Well, landing zone, hair effort, that well worked over slope where the initial explosion has occurred, had occurred, and I'm skipping to this specific.

426
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
They give a little bit of background.

427
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
This lz hair effort had been used a bunch.

428
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000
It looked like one of the safest places in the fire zone such had been the consistency of armed traffic in and out of it.

429
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
So this was a lz that was getting used all the time.

430
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.000
That was about how Colonel John Jay Hennessey thought of it when he decided on a special mission for Charlie Company.

431
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
First of the 12 for the following morning, it was a courteous gesture.

432
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:21.000
The main object being to return Charlie Company to its parent Battalion, but before doing so, a Hennessey plan to ask a small favor in return.

433
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:31.000
The company under Captain Don F. Warren, a taciturn Georgian who had been with his same unit since winning his gold bars in 1961.

434
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
So this guy's been in the same unit since for five straight years.

435
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
He was on the perimeter in Hill, on Hill 766 several ridges beyond hair effort.

436
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
The airline distance was about 3,000 meters.

437
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Hennessey directed Warren to sweep back over the high ground to hair effort after son up.

438
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:59.000
One worried about that passage, he was most concerned that Charlie Company should reconnoiter the lower slopes beyond the landing zone, which thus far no one had proud.

439
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
That taciturn it could rejoin the battalion in the valley not far away.

440
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Hennessey had no reason to be suspicious. He was merely being cautious.

441
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
The ground around hair effort had not been worked over carefully for several days.

442
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Captain Jack Cummings and Alpha Company were in perimeter on the landing zone at the same hour. They were not left wholly.

443
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:28.000
They were not left wholly undisturbed, but the occasional sniper rounds and grenades that innoculously bitten to their ground were attributed to enemy stragglers.

444
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
So there's a company there. They're getting hit occasionally, but there's just a bunch of stragglers is what they're assuming.

445
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Alpha Company needed to be back.

446
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
So they send in Charlie Company.

447
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Word of that was a foot and that reached major Charles Siler at the on at on K shortly after Hennessey gave his order the divisions.

448
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Public information officer was entertaining a visitor and a weighing problem all his own.

449
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Relatedly drawn by the news that Operation Crazy Horse was racking up a score, war correspondent Sam Caston, a 32 year old senior editor of Look magazine had just arrived in camp pursuing a theme worthy of Hemingway.

450
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Caston was the only correspondent drawn to the battle.

451
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
He said to Siler,

452
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000
I wish to know the thoughts of men facing death. So that's what this war correspondent says Sam Caston.

453
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Siler voiced an honest doubt that the quest was logical, men's fears and reflections not being all of one kind,

454
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:38.000
and the soldier hardly knowing how he thinks about death until he feels he is dying.

455
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
It is just not the subject that makes for easy talk among combat men.

456
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000
So that kind of weird, right? We got this reporter saying, hey, I want to go get some men facing death.

457
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
At the time General Norton had put the on K position on semi alert.

458
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
The whole camp was a stir, siler, and the staff were in the bunkers around the press camp, re-aligning some of the sandbags.

459
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
You don't have to worry about this ground tonight.

460
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Said Caston, I'm the luckiest reporter alive wherever I go, nothing happens.

461
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Even this guy who's looking for problems, he's got that attitude where I'm going to go look for problems and we're not going to find him.

462
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Siler remembered the words, thinking them slightly ironic and view of what Caston was looking for.

463
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:29.000
This guy wants to go find people facing death, but then he says they don't worry about they're going to be in any problems, because I'm so lucky that nothing's going to happen.

464
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
There's a big hill not far from here where a lot of men have died in the last few days he said.

465
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Then I want to get up there first thing in the morning said Caston, and by the way I intend to follow the subject all the way through, see the coffins in which you place the bodies.

466
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
We put them in rubber bags, said Ciler grumbling, hoping to close the conversation,

467
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.000
but Caston continued to fret about getting up to hair referred soon after dawn, siler broke off work to arrange for Caston's certain departure.

468
00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:03.000
These were the circumstances which resulted in Caston being delivered to hair referred by the same helicopter that carried ammunition coffee and a hot breakfast to Cummings and Alpha Company.

469
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.000
His first hours were unrewarding that the unit was too busy stacking supply equipment for an early getaway to talk with Caston about death.

470
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Besides the morning was disarmingly fair and quiet.

471
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Warren and Charlie Company meanwhile were beating their way along the ridge on the way back from Hill 766, having broken camp at 100,

472
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:32.000
at 100, a fairly wide trail runs from the top of the scarf, the entire distance. Fast forward a little bit.

473
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Alpha Company was lifted from LZ, hair referred when Charlie Company arrived at Hynoon.

474
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Caston stayed. On the landing zone, Warren talked briefly to Lieutenant Colonel Ruff-Rutland-Peard Jr.

475
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
The Battalion Commander and his S3 Major role.

476
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
It was arranged.

477
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000
That Warren and the main body of the company would continue their stroll down slope through the trees and across the river.

478
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Now, I just want to call out these words, it was arranged because we're going to get some more information.

479
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:20.000
So you've got the Battalion Commander talking to the company commander and they come to, this is what it says.

480
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
It was arranged.

481
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
That Warren and the main body of the company would continue through the stroll through the down slope through the trees and across the river.

482
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000
The mortar platoon would remain unharaford to cover its further advance with fire from the 81 millimeter tube.

483
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.000
So now you can see where we're going, the sergeant first class of the mortar platoon that we talked about from the squad leader makes a difference.

484
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
This is the guy.

485
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
This is the guy.

486
00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:02.000
The platoon 22 strong was led by Sergeant Robert L. Kirby, a 29 year old Negro from Los Angeles.

487
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000
The light of frame, solemn face, Kirby is rated one of the stoutest, harded fighters in his brigade.

488
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
So that's a little different, right?

489
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Now we're calling this guy one of the stoutest, harded fighters in the brigade, but in the reflections from the manual, he's not going to do a good job.

490
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
And by the way, they're going to get left with 22 people in a mortar platoon, which is again, we'll dive more into that.

491
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Few of numbers, his men seem to sufficiently armed.

492
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Each carried 300 more rounds for other M16s and from two to four hand grenades, the one heavy weapon was the 81 millimeter mortar for which Kirby had only 18 rounds.

493
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
That with the tube was as much weight as the men could carry.

494
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
But efficiently armed is an interesting way of saying it.

495
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Because we know that at M16 with 300 rounds and M16 is fine, a mortar is fine.

496
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
But if you get into a legitimate gunfight, there's something that you need called a machine gun, and you need a few of them.

497
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
And they don't have any.

498
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Not good.

499
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Moreover, it had been agreed that is promptly as the descending company passed beyond the range of the platoon.

500
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
That the platoon would be lifted out by chopper.

501
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Alpha company had 100 or so mortar rounds behind Kirby reckoned he would not need them.

502
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Casting the reporter had decided to stay on her referred instead of moving with the company called.

503
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
It's an interesting decision.

504
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
It's an interesting decision because if you would think if you're looking for to get in the fight, you would, oh, they're going to go with the trigger.

505
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
But I'm sitting on this kind of LZ, we're kind of, it's almost like a little bit secure,

506
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000
and these guys are going to go on patrol. I would probably think I'm going patrol. Casting for whatever reason.

507
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000
He says he decides to stay up there on her referred.

508
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:10.000
And it's Kirby, the sergeant who says it will happen here if anywhere.

509
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
No, sorry, that's casting that says to Kirby, it will happen here if anywhere.

510
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Like the working in combat, Kirby says about that, your dead wrong.

511
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
And he honestly felt that way though, as he looked about what he saw this position hardly

512
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Weren't such a serence. It was all wrong from any reason to tactical view. So now this is Kirby.

513
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
He's looking at the situation, even though he says, yeah, it's not going to happen here.

514
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
He knows it's all wrong from a tactical perspective.

515
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
The landing zone at Herford was by then a burned off trampled and rumple,

516
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000
rubble strewn about the size of a professional basketball court running length wise down the edge of a ridge.

517
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000
It scorched earth and grasses were less apparent than the fox holes distributed more or less evenly around the oval shaped perimeter.

518
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Originally these had been enemy spider holes, and were subsequently enlarged by American occupancy.

519
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
The trouble was that Kirby did not have enough men to round out his holding.

520
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
So the position became a you pointed, a you pointed up an up slope.

521
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
And this is where there's there you can see the similarity here from from the manual.

522
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:22.000
The uphill open and fronting toward the high ground was not covered by weapons present since the platoon was sighting its pieces down slope.

523
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
The company having gone that way and weapons.

524
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
So they have a U shape and they're like, well, the platoon went that way.

525
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
So we don't really need to have much there.

526
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.000
And that's where he decided to put light, not any protection in that direction.

527
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:44.000
In neither direction was the prospect of a fight was a prospect good if a fight was to be forthcoming.

528
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:56.000
There was beauty everywhere, but there was beauty everywhere for the to sue the eye, up slope, and bordering the very edge of the defended ground was a sea of elephant grass standing six to eight feet tall.

529
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Down hill there was a shear and rocky precipice extending 30 feet and giving away to an extension in the field of tall grasses, which also invested the flanks.

530
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Greenness was all about except where the men looked to their weapons.

531
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000
The company took off down, so now here goes the company the company took off down the steep clutching to the rocks, creepers and creepers for balance.

532
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
No preparatory artillery fires or air strikes had been put on the slopes around herford because of Lawrence movement.

533
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000
The earlier presence of Alphacompan and the all-round feeling that crazy horse operation was slowing to a halt.

534
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
This operation had been going on for a pretty long period of time.

535
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000
There's been all kinds of activity. They didn't feel like they needed to do any preparatory fire for this patrol.

536
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Kirby worried less about his platoon than about the movements and enterprise of caston.

537
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
The reporter, the men had gone to ground.

538
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
The correspondent was moving from position to position standing erect, taking photographs and asking numerous questions.

539
00:48:50.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Wanting to protect caston, he did not know how to object his freewheeling, though he realized that his movements were describing the limitations of the force.

540
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
In fact, these things little matter.

541
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Caston was enjoying himself hugely. He asked Kirby, how do you feel about these things?

542
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Kirby answered, if you think you're going to get a story out of this platoon, you're wrong. Nothing will happen here.

543
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Caston continued with his rounds of the perimeter, snapping pictures and asking the men, how do you feel?

544
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Kirby lost interest in caston kept moving.

545
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
The position of the mortar of one mortar was near the bottom of the slope LZ.

546
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Just inside the U where the crew had dug a little pit.

547
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:40.000
At approximately 1,300 the platoon began supporting the descending company with the fire of the 81 millimeter mortar.

548
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:48.000
The range 800 meters, it takes a while to hack through the jungle, Captain Warren got Kirby on the radio and told him to bring it closer, which Kirby tried to do.

549
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:56.000
So now you got the platoons up there, they're dropping mortars in front of the platoon that's driving through the jungle.

550
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000
An hour later, Warren called Kirby again.

551
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
This time the message was an uplift, said Warren, choppers are incoming to take you out within 30 minutes.

552
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Just about done so. Just to recap, you've got the platoon, you've got the mortar platoon in this landing zone.

553
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000
You've got the rest of the company pushed down the hill and they're just on a patrol.

554
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
And eventually they're so far away that there's no point in the mortar platoon being up there anymore.

555
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000
So now helicopters are going to come grab them and take them out.

556
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:38.000
30 minutes. That was what Warren and Kirby both fought, but the choppers had put down at landing zones.

557
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Avoid Hennessey's command post in the valley just to make certain orders that the orders given still stood from their delay.

558
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Holy unfaltable came rocking general Jack Norton rocking the high command rocking us all.

559
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Kirby got off his 17th mortar round in support of the advancing company.

560
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
That being the last one he fired.

561
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Remember that 18 rounds. He just fired 17th round.

562
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Then the thing happened.

563
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
There was no advance warning.

564
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Sergeant Lewis Buckley and PFC Wade taste were still collecting the company water cans and other material for the flight.

565
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Moving carelessly in the open even as was corresponded cast in.

566
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Including Kirby stayed put in their foxholes that they did so as less a sign of their alertness than of their forthcoming operational routine.

567
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Once lodged in position, they had not moved to scout its surroundings.

568
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000
The long trek via the jungle trail had half had them half busched.

569
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
So they're tired.

570
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Over much of the distance they had to move.

571
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000
They were crouching because the tiny overhang there was no shade where they were sprawled to sunbeat directly down on them.

572
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
And it was not less than 100 degrees.

573
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
The word was passed from hold a hole that they were returning to home base.

574
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Nothing much else.

575
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Not even the eccentric movements and questions of cast and interested them.

576
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:11.000
The hour must have been about 1330 from up slope and from not more than 50 yards away came a.

577
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Came the fire of a heavy machine gun.

578
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Its bullet stream was dead on the mortar.

579
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
The first rounds ripping through the tube as if the weapon had already been zeroed in.

580
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Thereafter it beat directly on the mortar put pit with never a pause.

581
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000
So came Kirby's first warning that he was engaged.

582
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
He yelled out fire.

583
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
But it was superfluous though he did not know it.

584
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Being too close to the mortar, a split second before Kirby had reacted.

585
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
His own men had started the fight.

586
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
On the left of the inverted you it would have been the right flank.

587
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Had these men been facing uphill.

588
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Once the fire was specks four Paul Jay Harris and then Charles Stucky had seen three enemy

589
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000
skirmersers moving in through the elephant grass, not five meters beyond their foxholes.

590
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000
There m16 there m16 fire signal detection of movement to which the enemy machine gun instantly responded.

591
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000
A swiftly as those three weapons spoke from the elephant grass on three sides of the perimeter rifle.

592
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Fire cracked and Kirby sensed that his position was almost totally enveloped.

593
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000
So he gets the feeling that worse around it.

594
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
He yelled to his radio man.

595
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Speck four John F. Sprains a call company get them back where being hit.

596
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:38.000
As the message was relayed to Captain Warren and as he remembered it, the words were come back we're being hit.

597
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Though the main body moving through the jungle was too far down the slope to get the sounds of the fight.

598
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Warren had his movement of agonized, had his moment of agonized shock.

599
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000
And that's an interesting tidbit.

600
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
A moment of agonized shock.

601
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Almost as if he may have expected that this would happen.

602
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000
He knew Kirby as a thoroughly brave soldier.

603
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
And this is the unnamed person from the manual.

604
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Two steady two seasons to be stampeded by a little random fire when he called for help the thing had to be fully desperate.

605
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:24.000
The confidence between the white captain from Georgia and the Negro sergeant from California was complete.

606
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
So these guys had trust.

607
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Wasting not an instant Warren called back on the radio to attend Robert McClillin of first platoon,

608
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
bringing up the rear of the far stretch column, get your ass back up that hill.

609
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.000
All hands reversed and started scrambling upward, men clutching at rocks, tearing their palms on foreign vines,

610
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000
sliding, falling and panting and desperate effort to race up the steep.

611
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
All did not fully understand the reason why there was no attempt to observe security.

612
00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Had they been without knowing moving into an ambush the disaster that too soon followed could have been even greater.

613
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Far above them on the slope of hairford, men who still moved,

614
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
crouched below to escape the sheet of fire beating from all sides.

615
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Most of Kirby's men had died in the first 10 minutes, though he did not know that yet.

616
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
The return fire from his people grew steadily fainter.

617
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Sergeant Isaac Johnson, a 27-year-old Negro, had been sitting with a plat board at the mortar pit when the fight began.

618
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000
He heard someone yell they're coming out of the woods.

619
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000
In his agitation he tried to turn the mortar around to fire it up hill, not even noticing that it had been drilled through.

620
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
The incoming fire was too great and his strength too little.

621
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000
So he slithered up on his belly to the left flank and dropped into a foxhole.

622
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:52.000
He could see 40 to 50 men at a run out of the trees into the elephant grass where he lost sight of them.

623
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000
They were partially camouflaged in their shirts where of all colors.

624
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Looking down how hill he saw many more of the enemy moving through the grass.

625
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Some crawling others hunched over firing as they moved in.

626
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
It came to him as a sudden idea that he should fire too.

627
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000
He thought he thought as he fired he had dropped at least four enemy skirmishers with his M16.

628
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:20.000
So by the way, I mean we're already talking about a totally outnumbered force.

629
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000
This in one flank he sees 40 or 50 bad guys.

630
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:32.000
From the next foxhole above him, PFC Henry Benton and Joe L. Tomato were ultimately firing up slope and downhill.

631
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Helling as they pulled the trigger Johnson saw his last of them when he ran out of ammunition and crawled back to the mortar pit in search of a magazine.

632
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Inside the pit there were four men heads down.

633
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000
The enemy machine gun and at least two automatic rifles were bearing directly on the hole and smashing its rim.

634
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Johnson could not be sure whether the men were ducking or dead.

635
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Sergeant Buckilloo, Paul Buckilloo, 22 years in the army was having his first go in combat.

636
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:14.000
The opening barrage cracked him wide open. He bolted straight across the perimeter, vanished into the elephant grass and was never heard from again.

637
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Sergeant Johnson couldn't find his spare magazine so he picked up an M16 with 15 rounds in it from the dead hand of Sergeant Edward Shepherd, who had no business being there that afternoon.

638
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Though he ranked Kirby and might have taken command, he was overdue to be lifted out by chopper for an appearance before a promotion board.

639
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.000
So he passed up the honor and died inconspicuously from a bullet through his brain.

640
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Another long time soldier under fire for the first time he had stayed motionless petrified by personal terror as boundless as the horror exploding all about him.

641
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000
His 15 bullets gone, Johnson crawled toward the mortar pit screaming, come out, you'll all be killed.

642
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.000
There was no response. It was minutes too late for that. The hole held four corpses.

643
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Heads bashed in by bullet fire.

644
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:13.000
In the nearby hole with Kirby was another bloody welter, a rocket. The Russian made p40 round of so slow of motion.

645
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:20.000
At the Ieasley Falls, the trajectory came arcing in dead center of the mark. Kirby sought in flight and yelled, watch out.

646
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
So did his foxhole mates.

647
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Spectre for Austin, Eldrumman and David S. Crocker, who cried warning in the same split second. Before any man could move the rocket exploded just to the left of the hole. Crocker died instantly from a shard that crushed in his skull.

648
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Drumming took heavy fragments and left arm and left egg. Leg.

649
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Such gouts of blood spouted from him that Kirby, who had taken four pieces of steel in his head, but remained conscious knew that Drumming couldn't not last long.

650
00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:04.000
In physical torment, Drumming tried to rise. Kirby pulled it in. Drumming screamed, let me go. I'm hurting.

651
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Kirby pulled him down within a minute he died under Kirby's body.

652
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Blood from Kirby's paint was streaming into his eyes, but the little sergeant could still see and think.

653
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:29.000
He yelled to his RTO, Spectre for Sprainsa, call company, say I'm being hit by mortars and rockets. We got to have gunships and Arty.

654
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Sprainsa did his part, Captain Warren struggling uphill, remembered this piece of the message coming in. We're hit by rockets and mortars.

655
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:53.000
He later could, later he could not recall that Sprainsa had also asked for gunfire and air artillery. But anyhow, he relayed that message to the command capsule at LZ Savoy and Sprainsa got the word back from him. It's on the way.

656
00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Those words find words, right then communication between the company and Paltoon ended. Both radio has worked. The mass of the originals intervened.

657
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:23.000
They were using radio, they work when you can see them. They work a line of sight. They don't work. Whatever the terrain was, they kind of dip down the terrain and all the sudden they lost communications.

658
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
At that moment, the front men in Warren's column were halfway back to Harraford.

659
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:39.000
They got double-dwarnts anxiety, though he was already doing everything possible. He had asked that artillery replaced on the slopes alongside the perimeter, not on Harraford itself.

660
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:47.000
For Kirby had passed on nothing about casualties and Warren was still thinking of 22 live men holding the contested ground.

661
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:57.000
The double-time climb had begun to slow from sheer exhaustion. Men stumbled, dropped in their tracks, were pulled to their feet by their mates and reeled upwards again.

662
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Warren realized now that if he continued the pressure, the company would reach the scene of the fight deadbeat.

663
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.000
About that, he no longer gave a damn.

664
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Passing information on the radio is so freaking important and so hard.

665
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:30.000
But if you always think that you're trying to paint a picture for the person on the other end, you've got to think that way. They don't know what's happening.

666
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:40.000
If you've got casualties and if you can give any additional information, now look. Obviously these guys are in such a horrible way.

667
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000
But that's what's happening. That's what's happening. He doesn't know that anyone's been wounded. He has another one's been killed.

668
01:01:46.000 --> 01:02:00.000
He thinks that they're in that position and he's saying, hey, start to put artillery on the outskirts of the LZ.

669
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:17.000
The sounds of the struggle had not carried to LZ Savoy in the distant valley bottom. The control point was a throb partly because of Warren's call for help. Still more because of the monitoring of the conversations between eyewitnesses who were viewing the fight from platforms directly overhead.

670
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:31.000
What they saw and what they said in no way less than the confusions. Colonel Beard. So this is the interesting thing about Vietnam is that a lot of times there would be aircraft because they had air superiority for the most part.

671
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:45.000
There would be helicopters that would just get up, CNC helicopters, command and control helicopters that would just get up and fly around and be watching this stuff. I have a friend whose dad was in Vietnam and he was a silver star recipient.

672
01:02:45.000 --> 01:03:02.000
The whole thing was photographed. This whole event, you know, there was a gunfight broke out and his dad sort of jumped into a a diekin and then crawled along and flanked the enemy and the whole thing. It pictures the whole thing is, but that tells you what it's like.

673
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:14.000
What do you got to do? Look, I got all sorts of things going on in my head right now. This is a brutal scene that you're reading. This whole thing is it's playing out and describing these different things is brutal.

674
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Because we already know we know the outcome and I'm describing these little pieces. But when you're talking about the inability for the and I think it's the company commander. That's kind of Warren Warren's trying to visualize was going on with with Kirby and his in his platoon.

675
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:47.000
When you when you was a leader get something in your head when you kind of create what you think is the outcome when you when you get comfortable with what you think you know the outcome or the situation is and you sort of solidify that it's really hard to change that.

676
01:03:47.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So if I picture this guy leaving and there's just complacency slipped into all these comments that you've read through these little pieces of complacency of. Yes, not going to happen. Yeah, I know it's going on. This is my best guy or all those little pieces are helping this guy warns solidify in his mind what he thinks is is going on.

677
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:21.000
And it's impossible for him and the part that I'm connecting to on my mind is how hard it is to for him to visualize things are nowhere near what you think they are and he can't get it in his head that this whole thing has been wiped out his best guys getting over run.

678
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And when you in your own mind predetermined the way the outcome is going to be it makes you so much less flexible and adaptable and incapable of maneuvering the way you need to and you know it's all on retrospect. I'm just thinking myself.

679
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:51.000
You don't presume how this is going to go. Yeah, it's one of the worst things you can do and you can you can almost hear this guy's brain struggling trying to accept what's going on.

680
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So it's interesting that you bring that up and as we start to hear more sides of this story.

681
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:13.000
This guy warns who's he doesn't really know he knows that his guy is a good guy and that he's calling for help and it says that's enough for him to realize that there's something really, really bad.

682
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:28.000
There's a panic. There's a panic of hey, like you know if you call me Dave you're on the on the else you call me a hey, John, I need to put right now. I'll be like, okay, hey guys listen, we're going to start taking the they almost immediately go into.

683
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So get your ass back up he's literally says get your ass back up the hill now. So there's a level of. Let's say urgency that he gets to almost immediately.

684
01:05:41.000 --> 01:06:01.000
We peeled this onion back. You're going to see that you're right, but the picture that he's painted is what's happening he knew something was going to go wrong. And as soon as it starts to happen, he's like, get back up there because he didn't feel comfortable with it.

685
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
It's like you said it's just freaking awful. Yeah.

686
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Back to the book Colonel Beard, the Battalion commander, Major Roll, his S3 and Captain Robert offer artillery liaison where at the brigade CP when the news came in. They took off in a Huey to view the fight from above.

687
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:44.000
This is a cat worth would get on the ground just kind of FYI just said everybody knows hack worth would get in the helicopter. He land. When it made sense obviously. Before they could reach the scene out of sheer happenstance, major auto can trail the Battalion executive officer of 112 was already hovering above it.

688
01:06:44.000 --> 01:07:12.000
So he's flying in the area. He arrived at the opposite peak when he heard Warren's voice in the earphone saying that a platoon was being overrun on herford. So Warren didn't know that the platoon was being overrun at this point. So he flew to station directly above and began orbiting low enough to see people milling around and firing on the ground below him. Cantrell was yet too high to determine whether they were friend or enemy.

689
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Then it william D. Fessendend. An artillery observer in another age 13 had flown the same way and was circling near Cantrell. He asked Cantrell. Sir can I bring in fire? Cantrell replied, no, I can't tell where our people are. Cantrell then flew lower.

690
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And about that time, beard the Battalion commander and his party arrived. They could see 40 or more men pressing close to the perimeter. They must be VC called beard.

691
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Either that replied Cantrell or GIs with uniforms soaking wet.

692
01:07:48.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So this is a I know it seems crazy to think that you couldn't tell the difference between you know American soldiers and Viet Kong. I'll tell you when you're in a helicopter and you're looking at things on the ground. It is not obvious.

693
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And you don't need to be miles away. You can get 50, 60, 70 feet away and things get really hard to tell what's going on. I was I learned this. I was up at found and we were calling in helicopters to pick us up. And I'm sitting there. I'm standing you know the terrain in found Nevada is not there's no trees is just dirt.

694
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And we're standing there and the helicopter I'm sitting there looking at the helicopters. It's like the wind is hitting you. That's our close it is and they can't see me.

695
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And I was just like what do you mean you can't see me I'm waving. They're like who coming around we'll come back around we can't and so I had to get out the red smoke or the orange smoke or whatever.

696
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:53.000
We are violet smoke because red smoke was emergency. I think I tried to orange. Orange panel wasn't big enough.

697
01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:07.000
So that's where these guys are at back to the book his words his words merely aggravated doubts all around can trails troubles that he simply could not make himself believe that one whole American platoon had been wiped out.

698
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:17.000
There and he was right now this is where what you were talking about you have this idea how could a whole American platoon get wiped out.

699
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And it says in the book you're there and he was right and it is right why.

700
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:39.000
When we'll get to this later this American platoon look 22 guys is not a platoon right that's not a platoon you think of a platoon you think of multiple machine gunners you think of 40 guys.

701
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And he dropped to 100 feet for one swift pass the phenomenon of those few seconds doubled his perplexity on the ridge crest above hair furtive saw company of men and dark suits marching to marking marching to the to the fire.

702
01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And he was breaking into the landing zone can't trail out no way of knowing that these were enemy rocket rounds not American rounds coming from other bases the dark suit and men up slope he identified as enemy he knew that he knew that camouflage rig which from a distance made made them to him look like so many turtles.

703
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
But where were the Americans if not on hairford.

704
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Friendly voice on his FM radio please please you must hurry. They was sprains of getting off his last message but can't trail had no way of knowing that either beard viewing from the same height was for a moment equally in the dark from the start of the fight with good reason curbion forgotten cast in.

705
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Correspondent he remembered only when cast and slid into his position to ask when are we going to get the hell out of here. Curbied in answer then cast and said I've got to have a weapon.

706
01:10:48.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Curbied silently handed him his own 357 magnum. Quiet now he briefly fitted into the whole beside curbied. He spoke only once to say sergeant shepherd is dead so now cast in the reporter is in the fox hole and he's got a 357 magnum.

707
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:24.000
All curiosity about the thoughts of men facing death was gone from cast and he had been eagerly questioning shepherd when the first shots were fired that that soldier's swift moral collapse and sudden death were his first shot contact with the realities which mocked his quest.

708
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:37.000
While cast and opening words to curbied wrinkled they also rang a bell almost anywhere seemed to be better than the exposed ground to which the survivors clutched now under a dust Paul kicked up by the grazing fire.

709
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The fight had been going somewhere between 20 and 25 minutes and the fire was vastly becoming wholly one sided. Next to curbied's position the enemy skirmishers crawling through the elephant grass were not more than 15 feet away. The fire buildup suggested they were bunching probably for a rush. Curbied saw them fleetingly and vaguely as through a haze.

710
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:10.000
The flash of an arm of the bobbing of a head curbied got off three hand grenades and that direction is rapidly as he could throw the explosion seemed to damp the close up fire but not for more than 60 seconds.

711
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:22.000
In this moment of decision curbied did not doubt that the ring had been closed and that all the skirmishers waited on the lower slope amid the tall elephant grass between him and the company poised for the kill.

712
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.000
This sitting there thinking okay worse around it and I know the company is down the hill but there's bad guys in between us.

713
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Still he yelled out let's make it. With that he rolled out of his hole and down the slope cast and jumped from the hole just ahead of him and was running upright and in the clear.

714
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:52.000
PFC Bob tastes and spec for AV spikes from the fox hole above curbied went past curbied one rolling the other sprinting then sprans a dashed by him.

715
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:59.000
As he rolled curbied thought he glimpsed Isaac Johnson off to his left firing two m16s.

716
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
He was wrong about that. Johnson had heard someone not quite echoing curbied.

717
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:11.000
He should have moved down the hill. His own weapon was empty. He paused briefly to pick up another only to find it in like condition.

718
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Curbied seen him in that fleeting second when he clutched two useless pieces before throwing them both aside.

719
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Johnson's face was already a bloody mask from three superficial grenade wounds. Such was his tension. He knew you're heard the blast of the grenade nor knew that he had been hurt.

720
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Now in panic because he was unarmed he made a running dive at the rocky embankment giving him getting him off her referred lowers side.

721
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Then he rolled on and on down slope till his body could take no more beating in that spinning descent he covered 150 meters of rock stream trail.

722
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Then in where he stopped a twisting V shaped cleft and the ridge back gave off to the left along this slit that trickled the stream no water in the palm of Johnson's hand.

723
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:09.000
He crawled into the bed of it 20 yards or so to where the jungle growth stopped them. Then he gathered bushes and vines down around him and lay with his face flat in the water.

724
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
So he's hiding.

725
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Dov off a freaking cliff fell down 150 meters and now he's hiding in this little ravine not too far above in the ordeal of the other few survivors continue to grow worse.

726
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Of this Johnson felt and remembered nothing. Thought paralyzed by the grip of exhaustion.

727
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
He had closed his mind to the sounds.

728
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Getting out separately some running others rolling Kirby's men had stayed that way during the first few yards of flight through the short grass just off the LZ coming to the rocky steep.

729
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
They began to converge toward the center.

730
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Wence the trail ran downhill. It is always so with men against fire.

731
01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Fear and herd instinct brings them together which is the worst which is the worst thing that can happen since it just shapes up a broad target.

732
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Sprainsa was the first to get it as they approach the steep Kirby still rolling others crawling cast and standing.

733
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I'm hit. Sprains a yelled and screamed like a panther.

734
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Three bullets one in each leg and one in the head but marvously he still lived and now he was erect and walking cast and the reporter yelled back.

735
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Hell everybody's hit. That was news to the others cast and taking a bullet in one arm and several grenade frags in the back saying nothing.

736
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000
In his last moments the correspondent had the courage of a lion. Here was a man and they knew it.

737
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Spikes yelled I'm hit. It was a bullet through the right arm. They then moved 20 feet down the rock bank when sprans a yelled again. Hold it up. They're in front of us.

738
01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Expecting it would come Kirby froze right where he was cast and kept moving in long strides straight to the trail which led downhill through the elephant grass.

739
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:14.000
He had made up his mind and Kirby did not bow their dish out of warning standing clear on the trail was an enemy shoulder rifle aimed Kirby heard a scream as cast and went down.

740
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Though casting was not 15 yards from him he could not see the fall as the body was enveloped by the sea of grass. He heard the whack of the bullet and the thump of the body the bullet had drilled cast and through his left temple.

741
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Cast and personal effect were looted as soon after he fell. The camera films and purse were later recovered from the bodies of the enemy in the fight that soon followed.

742
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Many of the next of kin get not even that grain of comfort. It is an agonizing matter for the commanders having to explain why the dead soldiers most prized possessions and pictures cannot be returned.

743
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Kirby could now hear enemy soldiers moving up slope toward him. They're chattering the clang of metal from their weapons being worked.

744
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
He was down on his haunches and so were sprains of spikes and taste. None was firing.

745
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:22.000
There only thought was to hide in the grass which rose to feet taller than a standing man. They all new taste was slowly dying. Two bullets in his neck. Multiple mortar shards in his back.

746
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Though conscious he made no complaint only asking for water of which there was none.

747
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:37.000
The skirmershers were moving up now and beating the grass on both sides of them Kirby saw seven of them coming right toward him not ten feet away.

748
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And he knew he was discovered. He still held an M79 grenade launcher, so did spikes.

749
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:53.000
They fired right together and the blast killed five of the enemy. The other two crawled away leaving blood trails. Another skirmershershers closed in from the left spring.

750
01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:01.000
The ground between them with automatic pistol. Kirby had his M79 croaked in his arm. He had just taken another bullet through the right wrist and was feeling the wound.

751
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:09.000
The skirmershershers came on and looked through the grass straight at them. Spikes fired his M79. The range was so short that the grenade didn't arm.

752
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
But the sheer velocity it blew the man's head off.

753
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Had it armed, it would likely killed both spikes and Kirby. A second VC closed in from the left only to turn his back as he almost stumbled over them. Kirby killed a metter range of five feet.

754
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Together two more groups closed in on them from the right and left. Kirby took two hand grenades from Spraenza, who by now was wholly down and throwing them in both directions with his wounded arm.

755
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.000
He drove them off. He had no impression of how many he had killed or whether he had even him scored a hit.

756
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
He simply knew that they had faded back, easing the immediate pressure momentarily.

757
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:56.000
While this deadly hide and seek game went on down slope, Harraford LZ was being pounded by 105 and 155 millimeter Howard Cers from the valley bases.

758
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Colonel Beard had called for it from his perch aloft and still earlier when worn asked for it.

759
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Whether it might have been brought in sooner and done any good is an open question. There was no right moment for its use until the Americans declared away, which movement could only be guessed that.

760
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Now it had come and the perimeter was being cratered.

761
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:27.000
One of the effects was to drive more of the enemy to the grass field lower down where Kirby and his mates crouched. The game was still on.

762
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:37.000
From down slope, a machine gun opened fire and skydred the grass beside them. Kirby went flat in the nick of time and the bullets is being directly over his head. Spikes didn't make it.

763
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000
One burst caught him in the head. The sound was enough. Kirby, two feet from him, didn't have to look to know he was dead.

764
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And he did not wish to look.

765
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Kirby crawled down slope about 10 feet now looking for a weapon.

766
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Thinking that the enemy might have dropped one. No luck. He was wholly out of ammunition and had no arm left but a flare pistol.

767
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So we lay flat on his back wondering what to do. Another skirmisher came up. Part of the grass and looked directly down on him. Kirby rolled over on his side and the same motion fired his flare pistol upward.

768
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:23.000
The rounds smashed into the glaring face not three feet above him. Getting him right between the eyes. The body was spun completely over by the blast with the figure kicking.

769
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Kirby did not wait to see more than that. He crawled back the way he had come to get sprainsa. The impulse was that if he had to die he would rather not be alone. Both men were silent now.

770
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
There was nothing to say.

771
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Time it about run out. They thought they were the only survivors though. This they were slightly wrong. Johnson was still face down in his private cleft.

772
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Spectre four Charles Stucky who swift reaction had started the fight had moved obliquely to the others and getting away from the perimeter.

773
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Hidden in the tall grass alongside the knob. He had rare fortune.

774
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Until the final minutes he came under a grenade shower.

775
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
The blast of the survivors to get hit.

776
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Directly towards Kirby and Sprainsa. Another enemy group moved down the slope. Kirby didn't wait for them. Having nothing to fire he crawled upward through the elephant grass.

777
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Leaving Sprainsa and passing the skirmishers undetected.

778
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.000
They fairly stumbled across Sprainsa. He played dead. His head being gory from a bullet that had entered his left ear and emerged through his nose.

779
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:34.000
It is less remarkable that the deception worked than that he stayed conscious and was capable of thought.

780
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.000
They rolled them over, searched his pockets, took his wallet knife and cigarettes and continued on.

781
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Having gone inert, Sprainsa stayed that way. Kirby had no sense of the barraging of her referred.

782
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Though the fire had been going on all of ten minutes. Now as he crawled upward he heard at last heard the explosions and knew what they were.

783
01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
That determined him. He would crawl to the fire and try and hug it.

784
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Two thoughts weren't his mind. Charlie will get his far away from this as possible.

785
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And if he had to die that was still the preferable risk.

786
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Halfway back to the perimeter. His ear told him that the shelling and suddenly ceased.

787
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Not knowing what that meant. He still crawled on. It was a tortured, most labored movement.

788
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.000
As his last reserve of will and strength was draining away he got within six feet of the first foxhole before he looked up.

789
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000
What he saw almost numbness senses and he felt as if he would faint.

790
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Sitting in the foxhole pointing M16 directly at his head was PFC Morgan of First Platoon.

791
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:49.000
He crawled a few more feet forward, still prone, looked around. Every hole at hairford was occupied by an American.

792
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Captain Warren and the company had returned to the hill.

793
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Sergeant Owen L. Lewis and James W. Edwards came over to help Kirby to his feet.

794
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
No words pass between them.

795
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000
They were not merely choked up. They were sobbing convulsively.

796
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
And seeing them Kirby knew tears for the first time that day.

797
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Later Warren said if my men cried it was because they were so damn mad.

798
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Kirby knew better than that. They were burning morning the death of the platoon.

799
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Kirby told them where to look for sprains and not knowing that the company had found them on the way up.

800
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Or that he'd already been evacuated from hairford by the chopper.

801
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Stucky appeared about that moment and he and Kirby were phoned on Kay aboard the same Huey.

802
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
It was some time later that Johnson came in. When the hill went quiet he started crawling upward.

803
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Coming to the tall grass he saw his friend, Sergeant Wallace W. Hood standing in the clear on the forward edge of hairford.

804
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
And that sight brought him to his feet.

805
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Days later he was still in the state of shock. Kirby taken to the hospital of his own choice.

806
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Return to the company duty within ten days still convollescent.

807
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:12.000
On Mike Johnson he was fully coherent with his emotions under tight control to the smoke of seeing the company in tears.

808
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Warren in the company had made that frantic uphill climb to hairford in exactly thirty five minutes.

809
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000
They descend over the same trail of taking them an hour longer.

810
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:33.000
If a record march it was too little avail. They saw dead Americans in all but six fock holes and fought at first sprains.

811
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
It was the only survival survivor.

812
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:43.000
The platoon weapons had been taken. Everybody had been stripped of personal effects.

813
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Warren deployed two of his platoons for a six hundred yard sweep to the eastward along both flanks of the ridge.

814
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
The hunt proved almost barren of result. Though blood trails were numerous and heavily marked.

815
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Only five bodies were found and they all too obviously had been feld by artillery.

816
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000
The fanatics must have hauled away larger count of dead than was lost to the company.

817
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
So in the end they departed as they had come more suddenly.

818
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Then mysteriously how the trap had been sprung was easy enough to figure out in retro-spect.

819
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.000
This enemy force of about two hundred was much too fresh to have followed in along Warren's wake.

820
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.000
As he came over the trail from hill seven sixty six the time intervals not long enough to have permitted a cent from lower levels.

821
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Toward which Warren had kept moving. If there had been an assembly and movement still no sound had been detected.

822
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Last the enemy's main weapons were sighted dead on target.

823
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Thus the enemy force must have been there all the time. Some yards off the trail and along the ridge sides as Warren's column had walked through.

824
01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Had Warren stayed in full strength on her referred there might have been no fight.

825
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:17.000
He carried out his orders of that came the most melancholy episode in operation crazy horse.

826
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Now you may have noticed that I didn't mention the author of this book that I'm reading.

827
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:35.000
The reason I didn't mention the author of this book is because I didn't want to cloud your impression.

828
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000
The author was a guy by the name of SLA Marshall.

829
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:52.000
And I talked about him on podcast 142 where we covered his book, Medigins Fire, you heard him use that phrase in here.

830
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And SLA Marshall was a famous military man.

831
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:07.000
And he ended up being a general. He was a historian. He was a writer. He was a reserveist.

832
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
So he was a civilian writer and wrote a bunch of articles. It was work for a newspaper.

833
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:23.000
He was also a very controversial figure and hackworth. Tor did a tour with him in Vietnam and kind of reveals the guy's character. He was very e-cautistical.

834
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:33.000
And he also made claims about his experiences in war that were not true.

835
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:43.000
He lied about his experience. He lied about his combat experience in World War I.

836
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And then he also wrote in a way that supported his own theories and his own hypotheses.

837
01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.000
And in Medigins Fire, there's a lot of people that went back and broke down what he wrote in that book.

838
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
On this podcast, like I said, because we didn't want to throw away the baby with the bath water.

839
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000
But there's a lot of things that were very controversial and some of them just straight up wrong.

840
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.000
And on top of all that, he never let the truth get in the way of a good story.

841
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:25.000
So when I read this portion of battles in the monsoon, this was on my mind.

842
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And the article, I mean, this book didn't paint Kirby in such a bad light as the manual did, which made him just sound like a complete, you know,

843
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Lacks a days ago guy that just let all the stuff go and didn't have any discipline and didn't follow any good protocols.

844
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:57.000
But at the same time, I'm reading this book thinking, well, you know, SLA Marshall, he's not necessarily a guy that's going to, he just wants a really good story.

845
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:06.000
So he's in my opinion, and just based on the things he's written in the past, this isn't something, this isn't a reliable source either.

846
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Even though he would go and interview people, like those quotes he's going to, he would interview people absolutely, but still he's going to, he's going to make that story kind of the way he wants it.

847
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:23.000
And so I was still not satisfied with the information that I had in front of me.

848
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And so I did some more research, and I found another article.

849
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And I found an article on a website called historynet.com.

850
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And there's an article written by a guy named Michael Christie.

851
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So Michael Christie enlisted in the Marine Corps out of high school.

852
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And then he joined the army.

853
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:56.000
They became an officer, probably went to college, came an officer served in the fifth special forces group in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968.

854
01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:05.000
And in 1970, he was the commander of C company, first battalion, 12th cavalry regiment.

855
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:13.000
The very same company involved in the battle at L. Z. Herford. So he wasn't there, but you know, you're going to have some connection to you.

856
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
We'll put some things together. You're going to hear some backfill.

857
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And he eventually retired and became a writer and he produced a bunch of documentaries.

858
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
And then he made a series of leadership videos for the 4th of the military.

859
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
So the military hired him to make leadership videos.

860
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Some of those were hosted by Lee Marvin, which is pretty cool.

861
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But he wrote this article.

862
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:44.000
And this article is called Last Stand at L. Z. Herford.

863
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Soldiers shield themselves as best they can from the dirt and debris stirred up by a hewie, squeezing into tight one ship landing zone around noon.

864
01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:01.000
The pilot touches down in two officers jump from the helicopter and land in a large mud puddle.

865
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:12.000
One GI chuckles, pokes his buddy and laughs quietly at the officers in fresh jungle fatigues stamping the mud off their polished boots.

866
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000
A dirty unshaven captain greets them wearing torn jungle fatigues and mud covered boots, toting in M16.

867
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
So there's one.

868
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:30.000
So now we're starting to get a little better picture. You know, you've got the stereotypical sort of officers rolling in with their

869
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
brand new fatigues and polished boots and outcomes.

870
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Warren, who's been out in the jungle now for a while on this just this operation.

871
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:48.000
The trio moves to the edge of the landing zone where towering elephant grass offers a bit of protection from the early afternoon sun.

872
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
The major unfolds of map and the three begin discussing a mission within minutes.

873
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
There's strong disagreement over the plan.

874
01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Lieutenant Colonel Rutland Beard, commander of the first battalion, 12th Cavalry, first cavalry division, and his operations officer Major William Roll are insisting that Captain Don Warren,

875
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Charlie Company commander, leave his 20 man mortar platoon alone on landing zone,

876
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:27.000
and then move down the steep precipice toward the valley below.

877
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Warren is equally insistent on keeping at least one rifle squad behind to provide security.

878
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Sir, my mortar platoon is down to half strength because of malaria and has only M16s and a couple M79s.

879
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
The first time I'm going to have a gun force security.

880
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Beard tells Warren that the mortar platoon will be on the hill for less than an hour before it will be lifted out and taken to another LZ.

881
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Warren's eyes lock on Beard's.

882
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Anything can happen in hours, sir.

883
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Eritated at Warren's near-in-subordination.

884
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Beard warns, Captain, if you don't do as I order, you will be in more trouble than you can imagine is that understood.

885
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Warren has a date to moment before answering, Tursley, yes Colonel, will that be all sir?

886
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Beard indicates, yes, and Warren spins on his heels and walks over to his rifle platoon leaders to pass the orders.

887
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Beard takes a sideward glance at Roll, shakes his head, and returns to his helicopter.

888
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000
So, all automatically we see where this is going.

889
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:39.000
By the way, look, I love this book. The squad leader makes a difference.

890
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:45.000
But the squad leader's getting put in a bad situation right now.

891
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Warren has every reason for concern about the safety of his understrength mortar platoon.

892
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Herifords topography makes it nearly impossible for even a fully armed rifle company defendant from a determined enemy.

893
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:05.000
It is a small saddle, 165 yards, long by 45 yards. Why this partially encircled by Paul Taule,

894
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
I'll have to grasp beyond the elephant grass, it's completely surrounded by rugged unforgiving landscape.

895
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:17.000
The most hostile being the steep Razor-back, Rajeline, reaching northeast toward a towering mountain near the near-lea thousand feet high at the base of the ridge.

896
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Herifords northern boundary begins to slope gently downhill.

897
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Herifords are on explaining what we already know. Herifords is also the center of fierce fighting that began seven days early on May 15.

898
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000
So, now they give a little background to this whole operation crazy horse.

899
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:43.000
When word of that battle filtered down to first cavalry leaders, they then decided the next day to conduct their major operation in the area.

900
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And that's what they're doing. Sitting on the edge of his foxhole on LZ Heriford.

901
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Staff Sergeant Robert Kirby watches as Captain Warren leads three platoons from his rifle company off the mountain and down a steep slope in search of the enemy.

902
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:04.000
When the last man disappears over the rim, Kirby checks his watch, it's 140 pm less than 45 minutes.

903
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:13.000
His mortar platoon is to be airlifted, off-hair referred to LZ Savoy, where it will continue providing fire support for Charlie Company.

904
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.000
To ask occupy a company size defensive perimeter with only 19 men.

905
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:26.000
So now we're talking company size perimeter. That's 150 people. Yeah, he's got 19 guys.

906
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Kirby figured the best way to do this was to form a U-shaped defense and place two men into every third foxhole.

907
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
This however, left the top of the horseshoe open.

908
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Knowing his men are spread to thin, Kirby, a 29 year old native of South Los Angeles, scans the perimeter from his foxhole at the bend of the hershoe beginning.

909
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:56.000
With the gun crew directly behind him inside the pit is Sergeant Charles Gaines and Spectre for Austin, drumming a former golden gloves champion with fast hands,

910
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Perfect for dropping rounds into a mortar tube, Sergeant Isaac Johnson sits on the ground nearby with a potboard on his lap.

911
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000
The one crew is ready to place supporting fire, went and wear the company commander.

912
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Needs it.

913
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Most of the mortar platoon have been together since fort-bending Georgia, but a few are replacements who have never been in battle.

914
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
So Kirby has no idea how will they react on their fire.

915
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:27.000
One of his new men is Spectre for David Crocker, a 21 year old medic who sits a few feet from Kirby reading a paper back.

916
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:35.000
His medical bag ready at his side. In the foxhole next to Kirby is longtime a radio operator Spectre for John Spraenza.

917
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Who is the platoon's linked to the outside world and is never more than an arms length away from Kirby communications are unreliable because the high mountains in deep valley.

918
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:50.000
How's the combo ask Kirby so far so good answer Spraenza, but who knows from how long Kirby focuses on the western section of the perimeter.

919
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Holding down the most forward position at the top of the open horseshoe are two men who have fought bravely in previous firefights.

920
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Private Solani sleepy Williams, who's deep sleep often resulted in heavy snoring and clearance Gomer Braim, a good natured hillbilly who looked and acted like TV's Gomer pile.

921
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Two empty fighting positions below them are combat vets, Robert radar, rotor and PFC Harold Mac Jr. in a fierce firefight a few months before Kirby had been wounded and pinned down.

922
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:31.000
When 18 year old rotor ignoring heavy fire ran out and pulled him to safety, Mac and rotor have been close friends ever since airborne school.

923
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000
So we didn't know that about Kirby that Kirby's been in combat he's been wounded and he's still out there doing his job.

924
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000
This guy has combat experience and I want to think that he's going to be an accidental in this scenario.

925
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:58.000
In the last defensive position on the western side Kirby assigned a competent and respected leader Sergeant Lewis Buckley with PFC Henry Benton who joined the platoon only two weeks ago Kirby knows little about Benton and the two new privates covering the southern sector a few yards away from Kirby's position.

926
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Joel Tamayo and James Francis Brooks Jr. both of whom joined the platoon just a few weeks earlier.

927
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.000
So he's got those guys that he doesn't really know too well kind of close to hand. Kirby decides to walk the eastern side of the perimeter.

928
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000
But before he goes he tells Buckley to collect and stack water cans food containers and other equipment and preparation for the helicopter pickup.

929
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Roger that, Sarge says Buckley as he springs into action.

930
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
As Kirby walks away he hears sprans a take call.

931
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Take the first call for reconnaissance fire and advance the company's movement in the valley below.

932
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000
So why is Kirby walking the perimeter because he's doing his job as a leader?

933
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:42.000
And he's also prepping to leave because when you when the helicopters come in, is it that the good time to stack up stuff and get it off the DZ?

934
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:51.000
The LZ? No, you want to have it prepped. So the helicopters don't spend a bunch of time there and you want to get all the stuff off the LZ so the enemy can't use it.

935
01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Sitting in the nearest position to Kirby Kirby's on the eastern sector is spec for AV spikes who is complaining about something to PFC Wade taste.

936
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Spike stop bitching and keep your eyes open.

937
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Warn's Kirby as he approaches.

938
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Spike's 26 to 7 year veteran who's disregard for authorities well known looks at Kirby but says nothing.

939
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Kirby orders 18 year old taste to help Buckley who's already picking up scattern cans and containers.

940
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
So he's stopped bitch and he can keep your eyes open.

941
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
This is what a platoon sergeant should be doing.

942
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Kirby moves the next position where look magazine correspondent Sam Cassen is interviewing

943
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
spec for Daniel Post and PFC Roger Robert Benjamin.

944
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Cassen came out of the field a day before to write a story about death.

945
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000
He had chosen to stay on her referred with a more to Patoon rather than travel with company Post known as

946
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Patoon's practical joke or feeds cast in mischievous responses while Benjamin only respond and yes or no answers.

947
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Kirby queries the two troopers on what they will do if attack they tell him they plan on throwing hand grenades down the rocky preposis

948
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:07.000
below their position and firing interlocking fires with their positions on their left and right.

949
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
So that's Kirby Kirby's like okay what do you gonna do if we get hit they say we're in the third

950
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
grenades over there and we got interlocking fendered fields of fire with these other position.

951
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Satisfied Kirby heads for the most forward position at the top of the eastern sector,

952
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:26.000
man by Paul Harrison and Charles stucky both battle tested specialist Harrison and stucky of established

953
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000
interlocking fields of fire across the open end of the U.C. perimeter with Williams and Braim on the western side.

954
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.000
So he set the positions he went out inspect the positions make sure people understand their field of fire.

955
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Squawed leaders actually doing his job.

956
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000
On the way back to his position Kirby Nides nods to Sergeant first class Edwin Shepherd sitting on the rim of the fox will not far apart from the morta pit

957
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Shepherd 38 is the only soldier there who's not in the morta platoon he stayed behind to catch a helicopter where he is a.

958
01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:03.000
To appear before a promotion board. Kirby sits on the edge of the fox will watch his sprains of talking on the radio with Captain Warren who's calling correction on where to place another

959
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Brown sprains of yells back correction to the gun crew and it then fires a few more rounds shortly after two p.m.

960
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Warren radio sprains of that the helicopters are on the way and that word spreads from hold the whole.

961
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.000
What Warren does not know is that the helicopters are actually delayed and still sitting on the ground at L. Z.

962
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Savoie in the valley.

963
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Around 2.15 five minutes before the anticipated arrive at the helicopter.

964
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Stucky spots three well camouflaged north Vietnamese army soldiers watching him from the elephant grass he opens fire with his M16 and Harrison joins in the three enemy drop either dead or wounded.

965
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:46.000
So you're if you don't catch well camouflaged NVA if you're not paying attention these guys are paying attention.

966
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Then in the next instant. A massive volume of automatic fire and smaller fires on least from the high ground to the north and a ravine to the east shepherd sitting on the rim of the fox holds killed in the first valley.

967
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Vali within seconds the rocker propelled grenades more to rounds explode near each occupied position men bro deep inside their fox hold under the terrifying.

968
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Shrapnel slicing through the air and bullets cracking overhead the platoon is surrounded outman and now gun.

969
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Kirby Elsa's friends are ready to warn and tell them they are under attack and need immediate immediate air and artillery support a stunned warn acknowledges immediately calls battalion for fire support and orders is company to turn around head back up the hill.

970
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
So to your point earlier.

971
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Warren the reason he was able to turn around and head and go is because he didn't even want to leave in the first place.

972
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:47.000
In the open stacking equipment taste falls to ground with two bullets to the throat buckly his shoulder covered and blood dashes across the open perimeter screaming get off the hill get off the hill and disappears in the elephant grass.

973
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Harrison yells for stucky to go to the mortar pit while he stays behind a hold off the enemy.

974
01:42:51.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Stucky takes a few more shots at the enemy turns and zigzags for the mortar pit when an RPG round explodes in front of him throwing him to the ground after the sharp no and dirt stop falling.

975
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
He raises his head and looks to see where post of Benjamin had been trying to make an escape both or dead.

976
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:11.000
He sprints towards a large rock right just outside the perimeter as he turns the corner of it.

977
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.000
He encounters an enemy soldier about to throw a grenade into the LZ spotting stucky the NVA tosses the grenade directly at him at stand instead.

978
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000
The grenade sails over stucky's head hits the rock behind him and explodes wounding him.

979
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Managing to stay in his feet stucky fires three rounds in the NVA's chest killing him instantly.

980
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Stucky then moves around the rock face finds a narrow crevice and squeezes into it hidden from the enemy.

981
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Paul Harrison slapping magazine after magazine to his rifle fires at every charging enemy soldier he can see when he runs out of ammunition he jumps up from his foxhole and charges the NVA using his M16 as a club.

982
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Cracking a few heads before the blood-covered rifle slips from his hands.

983
01:43:51.000 --> 01:44:01.000
He then wades into the enemy with his fist until he falls dead from dozens of bullets.

984
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:11.000
As North Vietnamese burst through the elephant grass, Sprains opens up with his M16 on full automatic tearing three of them apart.

985
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:20.000
He manages to fire off a few more shots before RGB rounds, RBG rounds visible in their slow trajectory, plunged toward the mortar pit.

986
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000
One round slams in front of Sprains' foxhole, shouring his back with strappin'l.

987
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Another explodes to his left killing dock-crocker instantly.

988
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
The third round cent strappin'l into Kirby's arms head in chest.

989
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000
The last round hits the rear lip of the mortar pit, tearing off drubbins right arm and mangling his left leg.

990
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000
He dies in a pool of blood.

991
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Gains his killed with a bullet through his head.

992
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Johnson, the only gun crew member alive, takes shrapnel in the face, but continues firing on the advancing enemy.

993
01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:03.000
As attackers fall, others jump over them, running toward Johnson, who keeps firing until he is out of ammunition.

994
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.000
He makes a running dive at the rocky embatement on heraford southern edge, and rolls down the slope,

995
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:19.000
carining off rocks and over tree roots until finally coming to a stop. He spots a V-shaped depression hidden in thick vegetation,

996
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000
with a stream running through it, pulls himself into the stream, and gathers brush and vines to hide his body grip with fear and exhaustion.

997
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:31.000
On the western perimeter, Williams and Braim, frankly, fire their M-16s on full automatic at the waves of NVA, as do rotor and mack.

998
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:40.000
A few NVA fall dead, but most brave the wall of fire over running the position in killing Williams and Braim before turning toward rotor and mack.

999
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Mack pops up to get a better shot when he takes a bullet to the head, crumbling back into the foxhole dead.

1000
01:45:45.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Rotor fires his M-79 until he is out of ammunition, then picks up M-16 and continues firing until it is empty. He throws two grenades at the charging enemy, forcing them to fall back, then jumps out of his fighting position at heads for Benton's foxhole.

1001
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:13.000
When he tumbles in, he finds Benton dead. He crawls out, and with bullets trailing, is every step, races over to the foxhole of Brooks and Tamayo, but there dead as well.

1002
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:21.000
The western defense is crumbled. Figuring everyone else's dead, Rotor does what he is trained to do, escape and evade.

1003
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:32.000
He tears down the side of the hill into the elephant grass, followed by several enemy, with bullets zipping over his head, he runs deeper into the elephant grass as fast as he can, until he's overcome by exhaustion and drops to the ground.

1004
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:43.000
When he is gasping, when his gasping for air subsides, he realized the enemy is no longer following him. He stays hidden, silently praying that he will be spared.

1005
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Still in his whole, sprains a sees at figure running toward his position. He fires off a quick burst, somehow missing his target.

1006
01:46:50.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Don't shoot for God's sake, it's me. Sam cast in screams as he drops into the foxhole. The reporter looks over at Kirby and yells, we need to get the hell out of here. Kirby shouts back where,

1007
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
we're surrounded.

1008
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Get six on the horn. Kirby tells Sprainsa. Tell him to hurry or we're dead. Sprainsa screams into the head set.

1009
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Please hurry, we're being overrun.

1010
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
But Warren doesn't get the transmission as communication between hair for in the company no longer exists.

1011
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Sprainsa turns to the artillery frequency and repeats the message. The artillery artillery all passes the call to Warren, who now pushes his company even more ordering his men to double time up the hill, a murderous pace in the mud and tangled vines.

1012
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:47.000
By this time, the battalion executive officer Major Cantrell is circling above hairford and his observation helicopter in Colonel Beard is watching the battle from his command and control Huey.

1013
01:47:47.000 --> 01:48:00.000
The swarm of enemy they see below is so intermingled with the mortar position neither officer can distinguish who to. Rather than kill the defenders by mistake, Beard holds off on artillery requested by Kirby.

1014
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Meanwhile, Kirby sees four enemy crawling towards his position less than 15 feet away and tosses three hand grenades as fast as he can stopping their advance. Kirby now realizes cast in his right.

1015
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:24.000
They're only chance for survival is to get off the LZ. He cubs his hands to bark the order when the badly wounded taste suddenly drops into his foxhole. Kirby ties a dressing on tastes, bleeding throat and yells over the enemy fire.

1016
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000
We got to make a break for it. Call, already on the hill.

1017
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Sprains are reaches the artillery net shouting into the handset. We're getting out of here. The place is covered with enemy just about everybody is dead.

1018
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:48.000
He is told artillery is on hold.

1019
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.000
With bullets kicking up dirt all around them Kirby entased low crawl over to Sprains and castin.

1020
01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:04.000
We'll go over the rim in the direction the company will be coming in Holler's Kirby. Let's go. As Sprains are struggles with his radio while he climbs out of the foxhole Kirby screams forget the radio blow it.

1021
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Sprains are pulls the pin of a hand grenade and throws it in the foxhole with the radio. The three soldiers and castin move is quickly away from the blast and a few steps later come across a wounded.

1022
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Wounded AV spikes clutching his M79. Kirby and Sprains have their M16s but very little ammunition. Castin who is also wounded has a 357 Magnum that Kirby gave him. Taste is unarmed.

1023
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:42.000
The five wounded men now move toward the slope, descending into a deep ravine to the east. Kirby tastes spikes and castin run crawl and roll into the elephant grass while Sprains act as a rear guard before rolling down the hill to join them.

1024
01:49:42.000 --> 01:50:02.000
As they reach a small ravine they hear the enemy coming down from the LZ and Hopper suit they lie down figuring the Americans are hiding. The NVA began beating the grass. The first North Vietnamese to spot the Americans is shot in the face by Sprainsa. Kirby kills another standing nearby Spikes fires his M79 near the group killing five the other two crawl away wounded.

1025
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Seconds later another group of North Vietnamese spray the ground around the American Sprainsa takes three bullets in his right leg one smashing into his kneecap severing the tendon. Another bullet rips through his left leg.

1026
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:21.000
I'm hit Sprainsa screams as he falls into a heap on the jungle floor. Kirby sprays the advancing enemy with the last of his ammunition causing them to retreat.

1027
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:44.000
When he bends down to check on Sprainsa bullet smashes into his right arm he's now losing blood from many wounds. Kirby eyes and NVA peeking over the grass and pulls out a rusty French flare gun. He'd found on an old battlefield and fires hitting him between the eyes. The soldier falls backward screaming in agony as his flesh burns away.

1028
01:50:44.000 --> 01:51:09.000
In the meantime taste silently boot bleeds to death from his throat wounds. Hearing something behind him, Sprainsa spins around just as a bullet enters the back of his skull, travels through his jaw and excess out of his nose tearing away the cartilage teeth tissue and skin. Eyes filled with blood, Sprainsa goes down badly wounded but somehow still alive.

1029
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Possibly to regroup the enemy stops firing. Kirby tells everyone to head farther down the ravine quietly the four-group survivors crawl then walk down the slope with help from Kirby and Spike Sprainsa manages to keep up.

1030
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Feeling somewhat safe with an NVA about a hundred yards behind they move a little faster, suddenly spotting a small group of enemy coming up a trail to their flank. Sprainsa signals to get down.

1031
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Sprainsa's chest is not seen as sprainsa's warning and keeps going running straight into a group of North Vietnamese coming from another direction. One of the NVA shoots casting the head killing him.

1032
01:51:49.000 --> 01:52:00.000
The enemy now opens fire into the grass from two sides. Spike takes several bullets in his chest. Kirby checks his pulse but cannot find one.

1033
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:13.000
He gets to meet troops slowly wade through the grass toward Kirby and Sprainsa. Kirby's out of ammo. Sprainsa's rifle is jammed but he has two grenades left and he gives them to Kirby who tosses them into the advancing enemy.

1034
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Just then, friendly artillery rounds begin pounding LZ-Hairford. The deafening explodes and stop the enemy's advance.

1035
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Kirby and Sprainsa take advantage of the situation and begin to move slowly back up the hill but it's too much for Sprainsa. Go without me he gas. I can't move any further. I'm dying. I'm not leaving you alone. Says Kirby.

1036
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Go now. Sprainsa yell save yourself. I've made peace with my Lord. Just go.

1037
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Kirby, believing Sprainsa will die for sure reluctantly, exceeds to the RTO's demand and crawls away back towards Hairford.

1038
01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Sprainsa, although growing weaker from loss of blood, finds the will to take off a scabbard knife, strapped to his leg by a leather thong. He places the knife around on the ground.

1039
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Next to him uses the raw hide as a turn to get to stop the bleeding in his right leg. He then somehow manages to open his first aid kit, find a gauze bandage and begins wrapping around his head and eye.

1040
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Before he can finish however, he hears rustling of men coming toward him through the grass. He takes his knife and do his hand and rolls over face down in the dirt.

1041
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Playing dead, Sprainsa doesn't move a muscle as three or four NVA slowly approach. He smells their bodies and stale breath as they search him for anything of value.

1042
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:46.000
One man turns him over and roughly strips off his signature ring. Another's take his wallet, cigarettes and dog tags, unable to stay motionless another second.

1043
01:53:46.000 --> 01:54:00.000
He's about to jump up with his knife when he hears a helicopter rapidly descending. It sprays the ground with bullets, some so close they spatter dirt in his face, screaming frantically, the NVA run for cover.

1044
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Still afraid to move, Sprainsa continues to play dead and seconds later he hears someone carefully moving toward him. He grips his knife a little tighter and when he feels a hand grab his shoulder he musters all the strength he has left and tries stabbing the man.

1045
01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:27.000
But the large shadowy figure bat-lick by the sun drifting through the trees quickly grabs Sprainsa's knife in hand, screaming, hey it's me Carlos Carlos Cruz.

1046
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Charlie Company had made it back up the hill.

1047
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:42.000
The last of his energy drained, Sprainsa lays down his head and slips into unconsciousness. Kirby is halfway up the slope when friendly artillery cease is falling, uncertain what it means.

1048
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:53.000
He keeps crawling, his many wounds are taking their toll but he keeps going until he reaches the top of the hill where he sees Charlie Company troops everywhere.

1049
01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Unable to control his wounded body and freight emotions, he slides to the ground, a medic gives him a shot of morphine and stops his bleeding.

1050
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.000
When the wounded stucky comes crawling into the LZ and other medic rushes over, lays him down and treats his wounds.

1051
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Sprainsa is carried up the hill and a stretcher made from ponchos and shortly he, Kirby and Stucky are placed in a meta-vac helicopter and flown out.

1052
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Passing the meta-vac flying out, helicopters begin delivering reinforcements who pile out onto her referred.

1053
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:36.000
A look of horror passes over their faces at the sight of so much death and destruction, one soldier throws up.

1054
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Hearing the helicopters coming and going, Johnson, who got off the hill and evaded the enemy slowly approaches the LZ, only to face the muzzle of an M16 held by PFC Morgan.

1055
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:53.000
He drops to the ground out of relief when he is recognized by Morgan.

1056
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000
The last mortar pulled to and survivor to get back to the LZ as a dazed rotor.

1057
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Company pulled to and leader asked Rogan to identify the bodies, all of which had been stripped of personal effects and shot in the head.

1058
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:17.000
He is able to name a few before the weight of the massacre takes its toll.

1059
01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.000
He cannot look at another dead friend.

1060
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:31.000
As he sits down, the afternoon monsoon rains begin pouring down out of the dark sky.

1061
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Rotor shivers as the rain pelts his sobbing body.

1062
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.000
So much death in such a small place.

1063
01:56:45.000 --> 01:57:00.000
So there's another view of this battle and clearly,

1064
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:08.000
the difference is immense the leadership issues.

1065
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000
There's a whole discussion to have about that.

1066
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000
What point when you're being told to do something that doesn't make sense?

1067
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.000
What point do you say, or not doing that?

1068
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
And this is leadership strategy and tactics.

1069
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.000
The whole assessment of that.

1070
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000
And it's not like I'm not saying leadership strategy and tactics tells you the answer.

1071
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000
But it gives you the options.

1072
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
And it's heavy options to weigh.

1073
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000
And you could look at Warren and say, well, if it wasn't safe, I wouldn't do it.

1074
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Okay, well, then he fires you on the spot.

1075
01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.000
He puts the young lieutenant in charge of the bulltune.

1076
01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Now, you can also say, hey, Roger that.

1077
01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.000
By the way, give me a fire team over here, give me a machine gunner.

1078
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000
This is what we're doing.

1079
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Once the boss leaves, you can do that.

1080
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
That's good option.

1081
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I like that option.

1082
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
You can, and you don't know what kind of relationship we have.

1083
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Because there's also, I mean, I guess we could say the peers that you relationship is great.

1084
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
I guess we do know that much.

1085
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:27.000
But sometimes, if somebody is very convicted in the way that they're offering advice, it can be convincing.

1086
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:30.000
And this is something that I have to be careful of.

1087
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Because I know I can be convincing.

1088
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
I know I can't be.

1089
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
And I have to be careful.

1090
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:42.000
In fact, that's one of the probably original reasons for me being such a listener.

1091
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.000
As I know that, if I say, I think we should do this.

1092
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
A lot of people just get a Roger that.

1093
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Like, if that's what you think, we're on board.

1094
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000
I mean, that's kind of something I had to watch out for.

1095
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:58.000
And it'd turn me into more of a listener because I didn't want to subdue people's thoughts.

1096
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
I didn't want to tamper with their ideas.

1097
01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:07.000
And I didn't want to override how they thought something should go.

1098
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:14.000
So we have to be careful of that as a leader to make sure that we aren't just being so overbearing that people don't.

1099
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
That people don't push back against us.

1100
01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:28.000
The three different versions, I do if you want to call them versions, just a three different perspectives of that.

1101
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
You know, paint each one paints such a unique picture.

1102
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And, you know, I wrote down on my notes again, everything that I write down,

1103
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
and just the things that I'm thinking in real time.

1104
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:42.000
And it's really frustrating to sit here and listen to this,

1105
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:49.000
knowing the outcome and seeing all these pieces play out, knowing that this was a totally,

1106
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.000
this was a preventable, this is a leadership failure.

1107
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
It is a leadership failure at a lot of different levels.

1108
01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.000
And this last one really paints a more clear picture of how this predicament happened.

1109
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:05.000
But knowing that this is not an unsolvable problem that they were just,

1110
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000
you know, way could this have been prevented, this is just simply not true.

1111
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:15.000
And the frustration of that. And when I picture just the conversation of the,

1112
02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000
of the person in charge telling a subordinate do it or else,

1113
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:26.000
just the philosophy that I lead through my authority.

1114
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.000
And the catastrophic events that happened that has, in this case,

1115
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000
we're talking human life, I mean, this is a, a catastrophic thing,

1116
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:40.000
but those same, that same approach and how often leaders are in fact,

1117
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:48.000
and what they want, not recognizing just how destructive that is to them as a leader.

1118
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000
And then I'm sitting and trying to picture these guys up,

1119
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
and I have a couple of looking down, and the seconding feeling they must have had,

1120
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.000
this is what, what did I create, how did I, how did this happen?

1121
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Well, it happened because of you because you as a leader demanded

1122
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.000
things happen the way that you want, and I'm picturing,

1123
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I mean, and I was struggling early with this guy with, with the company commander,

1124
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
not being able to reconcile, and that's just me piecing things together.

1125
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000
And, and I imagine this feeling of the entire time walking down the hill,

1126
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:25.000
knowing, knowing he didn't want to do that.

1127
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000
The, pat, you quote, front line, the front line, the leader in the field,

1128
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
is always right, right? So you're coming from your,

1129
02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
how will it come through? You're getting off and you're telling me what to do.

1130
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000
That just sits so foul for me.

1131
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
And the other thing that's interesting about this is,

1132
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000
you would think that we could be sitting here saying,

1133
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.000
as to, you know, military leaders that you and I were,

1134
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.000
it's very easy to say, we could, you and I could be sitting here having a conversation

1135
02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000
where look, discipline is paramount.

1136
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Obviously, we could sit here and say,

1137
02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
jocco, jocco is saying discipline is paramount.

1138
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
No one would question that for one millisecond.

1139
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Discipline is paramount.

1140
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.000
You have to, you have to get people into a point where they will obey what you say,

1141
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
and you, they need to do it.

1142
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.000
That's what military training is.

1143
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
That's what you learn in boot camp.

1144
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
That's what you learn in officer candidate school to,

1145
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
to instant obey orders.

1146
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Like, that's what we want.

1147
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
And that's just just so wrong.

1148
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
It's so wrong to think that it's so wrong to feel that way.

1149
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
And you know what?

1150
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Like, I'm so thankful that I had the luxury of being in the military

1151
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
and being able to experience this.

1152
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
And then on top of that, getting to see it while I was training people.

1153
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And then on top of it, getting to see it with all these companies that we work with.

1154
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Because occasionally, to this day,

1155
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000
someone will say to me, somebody at some company will say,

1156
02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000
yeah, but sometimes don't they just need just showing up and do what they're told to do.

1157
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000
I get that.

1158
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
I get that.

1159
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
I still get that.

1160
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
And what they think I'm going to say is, whoa, you hell, yeah.

1161
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
That's what everybody thinks I'm going to say.

1162
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.000
And it's like, actually, no, you don't want that.

1163
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000
And I actually, I actually had a good situation like this.

1164
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
I was working with a client.

1165
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:26.000
And I had two people on the call. There's more than two people, but there's two people that kind of rose to the conversation.

1166
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
One of them was, you know, but they just need to do it.

1167
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000
And I rebutted that guy and said, well, if what you're going to do is just, you know,

1168
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000
bark to them, shut up and do it, whether you believe it or not,

1169
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.000
that's not going to have a good outcome and here's why I went through the whole thing.

1170
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:46.000
And when I got done with that, the other guy said, that's what we need to do.

1171
02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
We need to actually listen what they have to say.

1172
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
We have to take their input and all those things.

1173
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000
We need to make their plan, all those things that we talk about all the time,

1174
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:59.000
which is it's just shocking that people still, you know what?

1175
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
They think tactically because tactically, if I say Dave shut up and do what I told you to do,

1176
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
you're going to do it.

1177
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
You're just like, this guy did.

1178
02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:13.000
It's a tactical in, hey, the Italian commander says, hey, you shut up and do what I told you to do.

1179
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Yeah, Roger that.

1180
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Okay, you just won the tactical battle, but what, what happens?

1181
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Look what happens.

1182
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.000
You won that little tactical battle and you lose these other people and look,

1183
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
could there have been no one waiting on that, I'll see you absolutely.

1184
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
There could have been no one waiting, there could have been no one waiting.

1185
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
There could have been no one waiting on that, I'll see you and everything would have gone fine.

1186
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.000
And that guy's tyrannical behavior would have been reinforced as the right way to lead.

1187
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
And in an eight the right way to lead is not the right way to lead.

1188
02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:48.000
This guy's a battalion commander, he's probably been leading like that through his whole career with with with with no consequence.

1189
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Certainly no nothing like this to this degree, this story.

1190
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.000
And you know what makes that happen and I brought this up with a client the other day.

1191
02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:06.000
In the military, because I say, look, you can be effective with that kind of brow beating tyrannical leadership for, for whatever,

1192
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
for an hour, for a week, right?

1193
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
I can just y'all Dave shut up and do what I told you to do.

1194
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
And actually in the military, I can get away with it from my whole career.

1195
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Why is that?

1196
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Because you Dave, you're working for me, you know, you only have to work for me for 18 months.

1197
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000
You know, it's going to take me a couple months to figure myself out.

1198
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:29.000
By the time my tour is starting to look coming to an end, you're not even going to give me resistance anymore.

1199
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
You're like cool, he's gone and whatever.

1200
02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
So these guys can bounce from job to job to job being in charge of this group.

1201
02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
By the time he leaves, they hit, he's hated.

1202
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000
But he's accomplished, he's quote accomplished the mission, right?

1203
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.000
He's got his good fit rep. He's done his job. He's accomplished the mission.

1204
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
He's hated. They don't want to do it. They're sabotaged.

1205
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
And they're, they're, they're sloughing him off. They're doing all those things.

1206
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
But no one knows it.

1207
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
His, his chain of command above him thinks, oh, yeah, well, did a good job.

1208
02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
He got the mission accomplished.

1209
02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000
First of all, they never got tested.

1210
02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Second of all, it doesn't know the moral of the troops because that guy's able to hide it.

1211
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000
So that's how these military leaders sometimes they get through their whole career.

1212
02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Yeah, and I mean, whole career. I'm talking 34 year careers where they never actually led anybody.

1213
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:15.000
All they did was bar quarters and they retire as an admiral. They retire as a general and they don't know how to lead.

1214
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.000
They don't know how to lead. Obviously, there's some incredible generals and animals.

1215
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Obviously, and captains and kernels. Obviously.

1216
02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:31.000
But just because you became an admiral or you became a kernel or you became a captain or you became a general.

1217
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:37.000
That doesn't mean you know how to lead. And you know what? You if you were a tyrannical leader.

1218
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:43.000
You, you can get away with that in the military. You can get away with it because only a two year command.

1219
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:49.000
No one wants to, they, well, I guess what? Everyone below you actually also wants a good fit wrap.

1220
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
So you want a good fit wrap. So you're going to bark in everyone and everyone below you just wants a good evaluation.

1221
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
So they're just going to kind of follow your lead and put up with it.

1222
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.000
That, I mean, that's that self preservation. I saw that in my career all the time too.

1223
02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000
And we had a term for it. We called it a run out the clocks scenario.

1224
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And we'd sit, you know, and we'd have, you know, young captains.

1225
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.000
The junior guys would sit around and it was just us and we'd vent and we'd get frustrated.

1226
02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.000
And I'd see people complain and I'd see my peers getting this off their chest and and when you do the calculation,

1227
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Hey, what are we going to do about it? Are we going to push back or we're going to, you know,

1228
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Are we going to fight back up the chain of the end? The conclusion is always

1229
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.000
just run out the clock man. This guy's gone in seven months or whatever or just,

1230
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Yeah, this guy's gone in seven months and by the way, we have a, we got a two month trip here.

1231
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:42.000
He's not coming with us. We got this. We got that. He's going to this thing and it's really what is it going to be face to face

1232
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
and him for another month. Don't worry about it.

1233
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000
And I don't know me to paint some picture that we just sort of resigned yourself.

1234
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Really what it was was, you know, I'm going to focus my energy. Oh, my guys.

1235
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Yeah. I'm going to, I'm not going to waste my time with this guy.

1236
02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:00.000
But, but it does create that that it helps perpetuate this scenario, just describe and, you know,

1237
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000
to whatever small percentage there are leaders in the military, just like every other organization

1238
02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:11.000
that got their way, they, they, they got their way through and it, and they're not good leaders

1239
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:18.000
because they do exactly this and, and I'm, I'm thinking too of of not just a scenario where

1240
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
you're my subordinate leader and I go, hey, I want to done this way, Jaco.

1241
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:26.000
And you're not like, well, me, you know, I was kind of thinking maybe plan B is better than plan A.

1242
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:34.000
You're saying, Dave, no way, man. What better position for me is a leader to have a guy who, who,

1243
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:40.000
the more infatric you are about what you're doing more likely, it's likely that the more loyal you are

1244
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000
and the more you want the outcome to be good. That's why you're pushing back.

1245
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:49.000
And if you're in a leadership position and your people are pushing back aggressively,

1246
02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:55.000
that's even more of a reason to listen to them because this clearly is something.

1247
02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.000
And what always happens is we meet, we see people meet resistance with resistance.

1248
02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000
The more resistance I get, the more I should stop resisting them.

1249
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Or I want to listen. Now, if you go,

1250
02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.000
well, yeah, I mean, I guess so, okay, according to Stu Mayway, and that's kind of the end of the story.

1251
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:16.000
But if you, if you go to the mat with me, no, this is a bad idea.

1252
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:22.000
And I'm not going to listen to that as a leader. Why is this person pushing back?

1253
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Because they, because they don't care about the mission.

1254
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
They don't care about the people. They don't care about the outcome.

1255
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:32.000
And it's, yeah, it's, it's Jockel pushing back because he doesn't,

1256
02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.000
because he doesn't care about his people because he doesn't want to be successful.

1257
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Why, why would Jockel possibly be drawing a line in the sand right now, right?

1258
02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Yeah, there's a read, you want to know what the reason is.

1259
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
There's a reason. There's a reason. There's a damn reason.

1260
02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:53.000
And you need to figure it out. And also, in this thing, this scenario we're painting where you're my subordinate leader.

1261
02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:58.000
I also have to give you a little bit of credit that you recognize, you are putting your career at risk.

1262
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000
What, you're going to bow up to me, Junior subordinate.

1263
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.000
I have to recognize that you even realize that this is a sketchy move you're making right now.

1264
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000
You're going to the boss and tell him, no.

1265
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000
You don't think the subordinate leader recognizes the risk that he's taking by digging in.

1266
02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000
In a little bit, and going boss, this is a bad idea.

1267
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:24.000
I mean, of course, I'm sitting here with the luxury of having benefited from all the things that

1268
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Eschlan front has done and all the things you've written about and all the podcasts I've listened to.

1269
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000
It doesn't make it any less easy to hear the story and picture that conversation.

1270
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.000
And know that that tyrannical leadership is widespread in its all over the place.

1271
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
And it doesn't work.

1272
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000
It's frustrating to listen to that story and you think about the catastrophic outcome.

1273
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:52.000
But even the subtleties of people leading through, hey, at the end, we can go back and forth.

1274
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
But in the end, you're going to do it my way.

1275
02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:01.000
What a devastating approach that is to leading the people around you.

1276
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Horrible in every possible way.

1277
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
So digging a little bit deeper on this.

1278
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:21.000
There was some, there was some people that wrote in to historynet.com and asked Michael Christie for some more amplifying information.

1279
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Here's one of the letters that got written in.

1280
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:29.000
The article last handed LZ Harraford by Michael Christie had me living the experiences as if I were there.

1281
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:37.000
I served in Vietnam with the Marines, including 40 days under siege at Caun Pin in 1967.

1282
02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.000
We always feared a human wave attack like experienced by the soldiers in Harraford.

1283
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:55.000
I would like to know if Lieutenant Colonel Rutland Beard was ever charged with negligence for ordering Charlie Company commander Captain Don Warren to leave his mortar platoon behind in a vulnerable position with no infantry support while the rest of Charlie moved out.

1284
02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Also, I was curious to know if Staff Sergeant Robert Kirby was recognized for his harrowing attempt to lead a small group of soldiers and journalists Sam Cast and to safety.

1285
02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:16.000
I have to wonder how John Sprainsa who was badly wounded and played dead before his rescue and the other survivors are doing today after their dreadful experience.

1286
02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Well, for one thing, we know that Staff Sergeant John Kirby, though not named, was written about in a very negative way in this other manual.

1287
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.000
But guess what, Michael Christie respond?

1288
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000
And here's where here's his response.

1289
02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:40.000
As one would expect, the horrors of the massacre at LZ Harraford had a tremendous impact on the lives of those of all those involved.

1290
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Captain Don Warren became an alcoholic and eventually committed suicide.

1291
02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:57.000
So the decision that we're sitting here toiling over.

1292
02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:02.000
He toiled over it too.

1293
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Sergeant Robert Kirby retired from the army and refuses to talk about LZ Harraford claiming he remembers almost nothing about it.

1294
02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Although he did receive a silver star for his part in the battle.

1295
02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
God bless him.

1296
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Bob Roter has a severe case of PTSD.

1297
02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
But still managed to succeed.

1298
02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:26.000
He married his high school sweetheart raised a family and operated in multi-million dollar medical supply business.

1299
02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:30.000
John Sprainsa overcame his physical injuries.

1300
02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.000
So Bob Roter was the last guy to be recovered.

1301
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
He got broke down trying to identify his friends.

1302
02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000
John Sprainsa got shot in the ear.

1303
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Exit wound in the nose.

1304
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.000
John Sprainsa overcame his physical injuries but suffered from emotional damage.

1305
02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.000
His drinking lead to three divorces yet the same determination that saved his life.

1306
02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000
46 years ago, allowed him to work successfully in two long careers.

1307
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:58.000
First in the printing industry and then as a rural postman for 20 years.

1308
02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000
He and his wife for 26 years are retired in the vignore than Georgia.

1309
02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Charles Stucky died of cancer six years ago.

1310
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000
No one has heard from Isaac Johnson since El Zihar referred who's overrun.

1311
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
No official record exists on Rutland Beard receiving any reprimand.

1312
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.000
He retired from the army as a colonel.

1313
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000
As for the company members who rushed to the rescue,

1314
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.000
all are still horrified by the carnage they witnessed once they reached El Zihar referred.

1315
02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:40.000
There's another letter.

1316
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:46.000
The story of Carnage on El Zihar referred as a riveting piece of work but as noted it very

1317
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.000
clearly in spots from the SLA martial narrative published 46 years ago.

1318
02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Nonetheless both authors accurately capture the overall horror of the event.

1319
02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000
About a week before the attack described by Christy on a company from another battalion had been

1320
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
overrun at Herford.

1321
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.000
And my company from the one five-cap first-cav division was airlifted onto the El Zihar

1322
02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.000
the following morning to assist.

1323
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:17.000
In his book Battles in the Montsoon Marshall claimed that all that the KIAs had been evacuated

1324
02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:25.000
the previous evening but I distinctly recall seeing the poncho covered bodies of the US soldiers still ringing.

1325
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:29.000
And there's one more little, maybe not so little.

1326
02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:35.000
There's one more detail that I want to go into.

1327
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000
So Sam Casten.

1328
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:53.000
The journalist.

1329
02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:59.000
He was married when he was in Vietnam.

1330
02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:07.000
And his wife, a woman named Fran Casten, had moved to Hong Kong while he was working in Vietnam.

1331
02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:13.000
So they were close flight.

1332
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
He figured, well I still want to see you.

1333
02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
So we'll move to Hong Kong and then we're going to go working Vietnam and then we're not working

1334
02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:25.000
on coming back. And they've been there for about a month before he was killed.

1335
02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:31.000
And they had a 13-month-old toddler at the time.

1336
02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:43.000
They were in Hong Kong and after he was killed, she packed up, she went back to the states.

1337
02:16:43.000 --> 02:17:01.000
I mean, devastated obviously and not only devastated but now what?

1338
02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Whatever plans she had are now obviously gone.

1339
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000
So she had to put her life together as best she could.

1340
02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:23.000
She had been a school. She'd studied English, I believe.

1341
02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:29.000
And she went and started knocking on doors and eventually got a job at the New Yorker magazine.

1342
02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:37.000
And then she moved over to the Scholastic magazine.

1343
02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:45.000
And eventually became a teacher at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.

1344
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Teaching right again. And that is when at age 40 she started the right poetry.

1345
02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:08.36
And she wrote a poem about her husband, Sam Castan, the brave journalist who was killed on that

1346
02:18:08.36 --> 02:18:15.000
awful day. And the poem is called Operation Crazy Horse.

1347
02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And here it is, a grand Calloun Hotel, a hedge of red

1348
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Habiscus, a tiled pool.

1349
02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:39.000
A masseuse who pressed fragrant oil of almond into my body in the full heat of the sun.

1350
02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Elsewhere, northeast of Saigon, a man beheld you and fired.

1351
02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:01.000
At the undertakers, you were all made up.

1352
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:11.000
And your hair was parted wrong, so I smoothed it the way you would have liked.

1353
02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Someone shouted, stop.

1354
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:23.000
As if we were caught making love on the couch and my father's house.

1355
02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
God knows what they feared.

1356
02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Unfamiliar streaks in your hair must have pailed at the moment of terror.

1357
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:41.000
And grown longer in the time since.

1358
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Eerie as strands of ticker tape still printing.

1359
02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Such dark hair shocked white.

1360
02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:03.000
How afraid you were.

1361
02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:25.000
All I could do was hold you.

1362
02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:29.000
And there you go.

1363
02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:37.000
There is more to every story.

1364
02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:47.000
And more for us to learn.

1365
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:53.000
And what we need to learn here.

1366
02:20:53.000 --> 02:21:03.000
And what we need to learn here is to learn from our opinions from all of this.

1367
02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Is that your decision and your actions make a difference and have an impact on the world.

1368
02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Again, like this is an incredible manual.

1369
02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:21.000
The squad leader makes a difference.

1370
02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:27.000
It doesn't just apply to squad leaders and applies to all of us.

1371
02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Your actions make a difference and have an impact on the world.

1372
02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:37.000
You're going to leave a mark.

1373
02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:49.000
You leave an imprint on the world and you leave an imprint on the people around you.

1374
02:21:49.000 --> 02:22:03.000
So make it a good one.

1375
02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Well echo Charles.

1376
02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Yes sir.

1377
02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Go ahead man.

1378
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Well it's true.

1379
02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.000
We do leave an impact on the people around us.

1380
02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:21.000
And we do make a difference.

1381
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.000
And to make a difference, we need to be capable.

1382
02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
We do the right things for ourselves.

1383
02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
So people around us.

1384
02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
We start with our physical health.

1385
02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
In my opinion as I always say.

1386
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:37.000
So on our journey through the improvement and maintaining physical health.

1387
02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
You know.

1388
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
We need supplement.

1389
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I give you hard time about just being able to press record.

1390
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
It's like a very hard job.

1391
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.000
But what I just did to you is kind of a shitty thing to do isn't it?

1392
02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Well you're throwing that challenge and I understand.

1393
02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
You don't have to come to understand these things.

1394
02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Which is okay.

1395
02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:03.000
For those of you that might be joining us for the first time.

1396
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Sometimes the podcast can be a little much.

1397
02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
We'll have you.

1398
02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:16.000
And so early on we realize that maybe a little decompression would be good.

1399
02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
I know I needed.

1400
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Yeah.

1401
02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
I know I needed sometimes.

1402
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:30.000
So so I'm sorry for setting you up with the freaking horrible job of going from that conversation that we just had.

1403
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Into whatever it is you're talking about.

1404
02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
I'm sorry bro.

1405
02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:41.000
It's okay and you know what in the spirit of understanding and how should I say.

1406
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Doing my part.

1407
02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:51.000
I should have took what you said and really gave my thoughts on it because my thoughts can be a little bit lighter than your general.

1408
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:56.000
So it would be a little bit of a trans a little smoother transition.

1409
02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Because you just went straight into talking about you know.

1410
02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Yeah.

1411
02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Yeah.

1412
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Still true.

1413
02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
What would your thoughts have been?

1414
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Oh man that's like that's why I didn't go into it because it was like dang.

1415
02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I should just be quiet just for a little bit.

1416
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Yeah.

1417
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Maybe.

1418
02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Yeah.

1419
02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
That's part of the thing.

1420
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
That's part of the deal is.

1421
02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
That could just be the end of the podcast.

1422
02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I get it.

1423
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Right.

1424
02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.000
But I actually don't want to leave anyone.

1425
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
That way to be honest with you.

1426
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000
I don't want to leave.

1427
02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Look.

1428
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
The point has been made.

1429
02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.000
We get it.

1430
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Right.

1431
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:38.000
It's true.

1432
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Yeah.

1433
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I don't want to leave.

1434
02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.000
So I don't want someone to press stop walk out and like that's what's going through their head.

1435
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Yeah.

1436
02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.000
They walk through the work also.

1437
02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Right.

1438
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.000
We need to little.

1439
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000
We need to bring it back around.

1440
02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Right.

1441
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
The world has darkness in it.

1442
02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Right.

1443
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000
We just saw that.

1444
02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.000
We just saw that.

1445
02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Yeah.

1446
02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
By the way, the author.

1447
02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
The his wife, Fran Castan.

1448
02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:00.000
She's alive.

1449
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.000
She's in like East Hampton or something.

1450
02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
She's out there.

1451
02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Right in poems.

1452
02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Yeah.

1453
02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Maybe we're here from her.

1454
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.000
You know.

1455
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Yeah.

1456
02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000
I mean, given the circumstances, it's like, okay.

1457
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.000
It's what he call like good to meet you.

1458
02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
But not under these circumstances.

1459
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Yeah.

1460
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000
That's what he'll do.

1461
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.000
The common.

1462
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Anyway.

1463
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.000
All right.

1464
02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Well.

1465
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000
How can we make a difference if we're not capable?

1466
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Right.

1467
02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
True.

1468
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:34.000
We'll just say it's hard.

1469
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I would say where we want to make a good mark on the world.

1470
02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Yeah.

1471
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:40.000
How do we do that?

1472
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000
What?

1473
02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:48.000
How do you suggest us doing a better job of leaving a positive impression on people and on the world?

1474
02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
I say, keep your stuff together.

1475
02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Cool.

1476
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Got it.

1477
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Keep it together.

1478
02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Clean.

1479
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Yeah.

1480
02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
You know, get it together.

1481
02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Did you get a break of your support?

1482
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000
He's reading freaking cans.

1483
02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.000
He's reading me greedy.

1484
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I'm not saying you're wrong.

1485
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000
He's looking at that.

1486
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.000
That's like a what he call like a vanity.

1487
02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000
But he's looking at his own can.

1488
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
He's like, oh, my can.

1489
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000
He's a notice.

1490
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000
I've to forever.

1491
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.000
If why I do, I've just happened to notice that these are two different cans.

1492
02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
So it caught my attention.

1493
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Oh, really?

1494
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Oh, I see that too now.

1495
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000
See?

1496
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
So.

1497
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
I guess I could be more vain than I am.

1498
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Honestly, I'm just.

1499
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
No, just now barely noticing.

1500
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:28.000
These are different cans.

1501
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000
The same drink.

1502
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Yeah.

1503
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Because right before that, you're looking at your fingernails and like you're, you know,

1504
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
I don't know if you worked out today, whatever you're looking at.

1505
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
You're physique.

1506
02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000
I saw the whole deal.

1507
02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.000
I saw the whole deal.

1508
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000
So all good and all or or he could be bored whichever.

1509
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Well, I think you've successfully lightened the mood.

1510
02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:46.000
All right.

1511
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Well, I'm done.

1512
02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.000
You know, a press record.

1513
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:51.000
I do things from time to time nonetheless.

1514
02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
When we're working out, we need supplements.

1515
02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
So, you know, it's joints get.

1516
02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Take a beating.

1517
02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Sometimes we've got supplements for you joints.

1518
02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000
You need protein.

1519
02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Okay.

1520
02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:04.000
So if you're working out hard and hard, isn't, you know, depends on who you are, whatever.

1521
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.000
You need a certain amount of protein to facilitate the gains.

1522
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Or should I say the results?

1523
02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Okay.

1524
02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Ah, you said games.

1525
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000
I haven't.

1526
02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.000
You said games.

1527
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000
I'm a little bit with the.

1528
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000
I saw it.

1529
02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000
The point is you need a certain amount of protein.

1530
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Otherwise, we'd buy now going to recover.

1531
02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.000
We recover correctly.

1532
02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Do you know the protein range?

1533
02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Yeah.

1534
02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:28.000
I see that.

1535
02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Yes.

1536
02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
One gram.

1537
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000
What?

1538
02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Go ahead.

1539
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000
You're like shaking your head.

1540
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
I'm sorry.

1541
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:35.000
I'm sorry.

1542
02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Interested.

1543
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000
You're going to.

1544
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:37.000
What?

1545
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
One gram.

1546
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000
One gram per pound of lean body mass.

1547
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Yeah.

1548
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000
I think that's.

1549
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Do I know correctly?

1550
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.000
I think that's the old school.

1551
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
It's actually less than the new school.

1552
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Okay.

1553
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
I'm going to arrange from point six.

1554
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Okay.

1555
02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
I mean, one that's high.

1556
02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
One gram per, you know,

1557
02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.000
fainter.

1558
02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Stuff.

1559
02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
It might.

1560
02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000
It starts to level out.

1561
02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000
I think it like point eight or something like.

1562
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Okay.

1563
02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Nonetheless, not everyone knows that is what I'm trying to say.

1564
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:10.000
So, and furthermore, not only do not do not a lot of people know that,

1565
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
it's hard to do that.

1566
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Unless you're like just that's your jam.

1567
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
You know, you're planning the week and all that.

1568
02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
You know, I didn't realize that.

1569
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.000
So, look, let's say you have 180 five pounds of lean body mass in.

1570
02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
And you're trying to get the point seven.

1571
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.000
We'll say, it's a lot of protein.

1572
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Not for you.

1573
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
I know.

1574
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.000
But I'm just saying for the rest of, you know, like,

1575
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I don't think about it.

1576
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000
But I'm everything up that echo is trying to say,

1577
02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000
you need more.

1578
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Okay.

1579
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.000
See, see, right, you're not like, you know,

1580
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
really understanding, like,

1581
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
okay,

1582
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000
seven, one range.

1583
02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000
That's what you're talking about.

1584
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1585
02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Mulk is needed.

1586
02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Let's say I didn't say any of that.

1587
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Okay.

1588
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000
What if I just said, hey, you need more people going to be like,

1589
02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
all right.

1590
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
You have failed.

1591
02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Point to describe why you need more.

1592
02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I'll stand down.

1593
02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
But can you hurry a little bit?

1594
02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
I'm standing down, but can you just, like,

1595
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000
we get the mass.

1596
02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Do you want to?

1597
02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Do you though?

1598
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Do you get the mass?

1599
02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I think we get the mass in the ground.

1600
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
I obviously don't think you do, and that's why I'm here.

1601
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000
See, if you do it.

1602
02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Yeah, between, you and Dave, you are too awkward.

1603
02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:19.000
I think I Bet, you know, I think I'll ask,

1604
02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:20.000
take good.

1605
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Anyway, take them all.

1606
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Yeah, this is too bad.

1607
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Can I ever see a more brilliant, like this?

1608
02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
I like it anyway.

1609
02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Speaking of discipline, go.

1610
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Okay, and bear with me here, bear with me.

1611
02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
So discipline, go, it's a thing.

1612
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
It tastes good, it's a little drink.

1613
02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Kind of like a soda.

1614
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Mmm-hmm.

1615
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
I mean, okay, it's not like a soda

1616
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
but it's like a soda.

1617
02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.08
So, and I'm gonna tell a little story short.

1618
02:29:46.08 --> 02:29:48.20
So, you know how like when you go to the movies, right?

1619
02:29:48.20 --> 02:29:49.20
You go to the movies.

1620
02:29:49.20 --> 02:29:50.20
Yep, do you get no?

1621
02:29:50.20 --> 02:29:51.60
So, the in popcorn at the movies.

1622
02:29:51.60 --> 02:29:52.60
Sure.

1623
02:29:52.60 --> 02:29:53.60
They've broke.

1624
02:29:53.60 --> 02:29:54.60
So, the popcorn?

1625
02:29:54.60 --> 02:29:55.60
Sometimes, right?

1626
02:29:55.60 --> 02:29:56.60
Yeah, that's the thing.

1627
02:29:56.60 --> 02:29:59.54
So, you go to the movies, you get your soda, you get your popcorn, you have the

1628
02:29:59.54 --> 02:30:02.16
wash the movie, but your kids, it's awesome, right?

1629
02:30:02.16 --> 02:30:06.44
You come home and you kind of remember whether it be later that night or the next day,

1630
02:30:06.44 --> 02:30:07.84
you're like, oh yeah, that's a cool movie.

1631
02:30:07.84 --> 02:30:09.76
I mean, man, but I ate that whole thing of popcorn.

1632
02:30:09.76 --> 02:30:12.96
You know, many calories are in popcorn and junk calories, too, by the way.

1633
02:30:12.96 --> 02:30:13.96
There's a difference.

1634
02:30:13.96 --> 02:30:14.96
I have no idea.

1635
02:30:14.96 --> 02:30:17.92
It's like 2000, it depends on how big the popcorn is.

1636
02:30:17.92 --> 02:30:18.92
And then you got the soda, right?

1637
02:30:18.92 --> 02:30:23.52
And there's a small tinge of guilt that comes with you.

1638
02:30:23.52 --> 02:30:27.24
Same thing with the brownies, same thing with the other stuff that you eat, don't

1639
02:30:27.24 --> 02:30:28.24
actually eat.

1640
02:30:28.24 --> 02:30:31.76
Oh, the pretzel wrap, pretzel wrapped hot dogs at my wife made for me on Superb

1641
02:30:31.76 --> 02:30:32.76
Balls Sunday.

1642
02:30:32.76 --> 02:30:37.04
I somehow, I forget where everyone was, but like, they came out of the oven.

1643
02:30:37.04 --> 02:30:38.84
And my fam wasn't around.

1644
02:30:38.84 --> 02:30:41.84
And I was like, oh, I just have one or two while my family's not around.

1645
02:30:41.84 --> 02:30:44.68
I racked it half a track, half a tray.

1646
02:30:44.68 --> 02:30:45.68
I crushed them.

1647
02:30:45.68 --> 02:30:47.92
How big was the tray?

1648
02:30:47.92 --> 02:30:50.04
I don't know this, but it's like a cookie type.

1649
02:30:50.04 --> 02:30:51.84
Oh, like a sheet like a regular standard.

1650
02:30:51.84 --> 02:30:52.84
Yeah, the standard.

1651
02:30:52.84 --> 02:30:53.84
It's a lot.

1652
02:30:53.84 --> 02:30:56.08
It must have been a nice good.

1653
02:30:56.08 --> 02:31:00.28
I'm going to go and say 20, 20 of those things.

1654
02:31:00.28 --> 02:31:02.36
You figure like no, like no factor.

1655
02:31:02.36 --> 02:31:04.88
That's probably like 300 calories per probably.

1656
02:31:04.88 --> 02:31:05.88
I have to.

1657
02:31:05.88 --> 02:31:07.60
They're real small.

1658
02:31:07.60 --> 02:31:13.16
But those are like sausages with freaking straight up biscuits.

1659
02:31:13.16 --> 02:31:15.44
Yeah, like, oh, that's who knows.

1660
02:31:15.44 --> 02:31:16.64
But I bought it there.

1661
02:31:16.64 --> 02:31:17.64
Oh, yeah.

1662
02:31:17.64 --> 02:31:18.64
It sounded nice.

1663
02:31:18.64 --> 02:31:19.48
And you, I get it.

1664
02:31:19.48 --> 02:31:21.96
Like you'll just go punish, you know, you'll pay the price in X-in.

1665
02:31:21.96 --> 02:31:28.12
They're just a little bit more like gal to, like, man, I just, I kind of just shouldn't

1666
02:31:28.12 --> 02:31:29.12
have done that.

1667
02:31:29.12 --> 02:31:33.08
You know, anyway, the point is when you drink the discipline, go and the milk, too, by

1668
02:31:33.08 --> 02:31:37.56
the way, you get that same sort of satisfaction that you would have had with the soda

1669
02:31:37.56 --> 02:31:43.16
or the freaking Oreo cookie shake from the drive through or wherever.

1670
02:31:43.16 --> 02:31:46.40
You get that same front end, but you get a way better back end.

1671
02:31:46.40 --> 02:31:47.40
You do the same thing.

1672
02:31:47.40 --> 02:31:48.40
You get actually positivity.

1673
02:31:48.40 --> 02:31:49.40
Exactly.

1674
02:31:49.40 --> 02:31:50.40
It was actually better.

1675
02:31:50.40 --> 02:31:53.68
What was weird was I kind of thought about it because I had a milkshake with a banana

1676
02:31:53.68 --> 02:31:54.68
by the way.

1677
02:31:54.68 --> 02:31:57.04
And the next house like man, last night I had that dessert.

1678
02:31:57.04 --> 02:31:59.60
I was like, wait, the dessert wasn't something junk.

1679
02:31:59.60 --> 02:32:00.60
It was something good.

1680
02:32:00.60 --> 02:32:01.60
Yeah.

1681
02:32:01.60 --> 02:32:02.60
So it's like you get the refreshing.

1682
02:32:02.60 --> 02:32:04.60
You got a double positive hit.

1683
02:32:04.60 --> 02:32:07.60
Actually, we're protein getting to your 0.7.

1684
02:32:07.60 --> 02:32:08.60
Yeah, I guess.

1685
02:32:08.60 --> 02:32:11.60
And then you got a guilt for not even guilt free, but positivity.

1686
02:32:11.60 --> 02:32:12.60
Yeah.

1687
02:32:12.60 --> 02:32:17.60
So this is like across the board, win, win, front end back end, tactical strategic, all

1688
02:32:17.60 --> 02:32:18.60
good stuff.

1689
02:32:18.60 --> 02:32:19.60
Okay.

1690
02:32:19.60 --> 02:32:20.60
Appreciate that.

1691
02:32:20.60 --> 02:32:21.60
You got a bunch of other stuff there.

1692
02:32:21.60 --> 02:32:27.84
Super grill, vitamin D, three cold war, war your kids, mo, mo.

1693
02:32:27.84 --> 02:32:29.72
You got all kinds of good stuff.

1694
02:32:29.72 --> 02:32:31.84
You can get it from jockelfuel.com.

1695
02:32:31.84 --> 02:32:34.56
And by the way, if you subscribe to any of these things, the shipping

1696
02:32:34.56 --> 02:32:37.64
is free because we know that that was kind of an issue.

1697
02:32:37.64 --> 02:32:42.24
People are like, I want this stuff, but shipping is expensive.

1698
02:32:42.24 --> 02:32:46.44
We're trying to allow people to more easily stay on the path.

1699
02:32:46.44 --> 02:32:53.68
And also, if you're just a person that doesn't quite stay on track, that doesn't

1700
02:32:53.68 --> 02:32:54.68
quite.

1701
02:32:54.68 --> 02:32:55.68
It's a thing.

1702
02:32:55.68 --> 02:32:58.64
Two things that they're supposed to do and they end up saying, well, I actually ran

1703
02:32:58.64 --> 02:32:59.64
out and doing more fair.

1704
02:32:59.64 --> 02:33:00.64
Whatever.

1705
02:33:00.64 --> 02:33:01.64
Just subscribe.

1706
02:33:01.64 --> 02:33:02.64
That's what I'm talking about.

1707
02:33:02.64 --> 02:33:03.64
That's what I'm talking about.

1708
02:33:03.64 --> 02:33:05.36
If you subscribe, it's coming.

1709
02:33:05.36 --> 02:33:06.60
And it's free shipping.

1710
02:33:06.60 --> 02:33:09.96
Get some jockelfuel.com.

1711
02:33:09.96 --> 02:33:16.04
Also you can get the drink at wall wall.

1712
02:33:16.04 --> 02:33:18.36
Chain wide, by the way.

1713
02:33:18.36 --> 02:33:19.36
Chain wide.

1714
02:33:19.36 --> 02:33:21.80
Apparently there's some insurgency happening.

1715
02:33:21.80 --> 02:33:30.20
Some other brands are trying to maneuver and they're getting ambushed.

1716
02:33:30.20 --> 02:33:35.88
So I appreciate everyone going in there and just getting after it, clearing shelves.

1717
02:33:35.88 --> 02:33:38.12
Yeah, and it tells kind of good story.

1718
02:33:38.12 --> 02:33:39.12
Did you see Corey?

1719
02:33:39.12 --> 02:33:41.12
Did Corey?

1720
02:33:41.12 --> 02:33:42.96
He went in with a cooler.

1721
02:33:42.96 --> 02:33:45.16
He literally cleared.

1722
02:33:45.16 --> 02:33:46.16
He posted it.

1723
02:33:46.16 --> 02:33:51.20
He literally cleared the the the the the fridge out.

1724
02:33:51.20 --> 02:33:54.92
Yeah, you can imagine the guy at the front desk or the cashier guys like Broadway.

1725
02:33:54.92 --> 02:33:56.20
Why do you have a cooler here?

1726
02:33:56.20 --> 02:33:59.48
He's like, oh, because I'm going to go.

1727
02:33:59.48 --> 02:34:05.12
My current favorite thing to do is I get tagged on on Instagram all the time of people doing

1728
02:34:05.12 --> 02:34:06.12
that.

1729
02:34:06.12 --> 02:34:10.36
And I just put it on my story and it's just story after story people going in, tagging

1730
02:34:10.36 --> 02:34:14.28
wall wall and just emptying the shelves and like buying everything they can.

1731
02:34:14.28 --> 02:34:15.40
It is awesome.

1732
02:34:15.40 --> 02:34:18.08
Yeah, appreciate everyone getting after that.

1733
02:34:18.08 --> 02:34:21.96
And you can also get all the supplement, the whole line at a vitamin shop.

1734
02:34:21.96 --> 02:34:25.32
And like I said, free shipping.

1735
02:34:25.32 --> 02:34:29.16
If you subscribe, if you might also need juttu gear.

1736
02:34:29.16 --> 02:34:32.52
Or the juttu gear, you might need a rash guard.

1737
02:34:32.52 --> 02:34:35.72
You can get all that stuff from origin USA dot com.

1738
02:34:35.72 --> 02:34:37.20
By the way, implemented.

1739
02:34:37.20 --> 02:34:40.84
Implemented origin USA dot com.

1740
02:34:40.84 --> 02:34:42.92
You can get that there.

1741

All this good stuff.

1742
02:34:43.92 --> 02:34:48.32
If you if you ever are off the mats of justice and you need something to wear, because

1743
02:34:48.32 --> 02:34:50.24
we know what we're wearing on the mats, right?

1744
02:34:50.24 --> 02:34:54.24
We're wearing our origin G or our origin rashcraft.

1745
02:34:54.24 --> 02:34:59.12
But if you're off the mats of justice and you need clothing, what you do, you can get

1746
02:34:59.12 --> 02:35:02.36
jeans, you can get boots, you can get.

1747
02:35:02.36 --> 02:35:03.88
Dang, we got socks coming.

1748
02:35:03.88 --> 02:35:04.88
What?

1749
02:35:04.88 --> 02:35:05.88
You can get everything.

1750
02:35:05.88 --> 02:35:06.88
We're getting them.

1751
02:35:06.88 --> 02:35:07.88
We're getting them.

1752
02:35:07.88 --> 02:35:13.08
All of it's all this made in America, made in America, which is, which is what we are

1753
02:35:13.08 --> 02:35:17.24
doing to rebuild manufacturing in this country.

1754
02:35:17.24 --> 02:35:20.88
So go to origin USA dot com.

1755
02:35:20.88 --> 02:35:21.88
Get whatever you need.

1756
02:35:21.88 --> 02:35:28.40
Also, if you need more stuff, you know, to wear off the mats and on, by the way, go to

1757
02:35:28.40 --> 02:35:30.40
jockelstore dot com.

1758
02:35:30.40 --> 02:35:35.40
Now, here you can find your more discipline themed.

1759
02:35:35.40 --> 02:35:40.76
I don't like the word theme, but more disciplines that slanted skewed a pair of

1760
02:35:40.76 --> 02:35:41.76
pair.

1761
02:35:41.76 --> 02:35:42.76
Here's the thing.

1762
02:35:42.76 --> 02:35:44.48
You do want to represent one when you're on the path.

1763
02:35:44.48 --> 02:35:45.48
You do.

1764
02:35:45.48 --> 02:35:49.08
Think about what you are representing, no.

1765
02:35:49.08 --> 02:35:50.08
It's facing.

1766
02:35:50.08 --> 02:35:53.96
You do run the risk of representing the same thing.

1767
02:35:53.96 --> 02:35:58.04
Your neighbor across the street, who's not on the path, by the way.

1768
02:35:58.04 --> 02:35:59.04
These are represented.

1769
02:35:59.04 --> 02:36:00.04
Are you a deletes?

1770
02:36:00.04 --> 02:36:01.04
No, no, no, no, no.

1771
02:36:01.04 --> 02:36:02.04
Where's my neighbor across the street?

1772
02:36:02.04 --> 02:36:03.04
It's a badass.

1773
02:36:03.04 --> 02:36:04.56
Well, then, okay, then there you go.

1774
02:36:04.56 --> 02:36:05.56
That's cool.

1775
02:36:05.56 --> 02:36:06.96
But I'm saying you do run the risk.

1776
02:36:06.96 --> 02:36:07.96
Got it.

1777
02:36:07.96 --> 02:36:11.12
So, I'm saying, look, if you have discipline, you go to freedom, or you have good, or you

1778
02:36:11.12 --> 02:36:14.52
have like one of the hoodies or something like this, you don't run that risk.

1779
02:36:14.52 --> 02:36:17.88
You seem to say, so if you're going to represent on the path here, this is a good place

1780
02:36:17.88 --> 02:36:20.96
to get this stuff, and it's a good move over.

1781
02:36:20.96 --> 02:36:21.96
Where do you get it?

1782
02:36:21.96 --> 02:36:22.96

1783
02:36:22.96 --> 02:36:26.92
We have a little subscription situation going on to call the shirt locker.

1784
02:36:26.92 --> 02:36:29.60
That's a different.

1785
02:36:29.60 --> 02:36:33.92
It's not different, but it's kind of different.

1786
02:36:33.92 --> 02:36:36.28
Jack, it's a shirt every month.

1787
02:36:36.28 --> 02:36:37.60
Cool new design exclusive.

1788
02:36:37.60 --> 02:36:39.48
You can't get them on the store, otherwise.

1789
02:36:39.48 --> 02:36:40.48
Can't.

1790
02:36:40.48 --> 02:36:41.48
These new ones.

1791
02:36:41.48 --> 02:36:43.48
You're new to this elite.

1792
02:36:43.48 --> 02:36:45.48
Kind of elite shirt wearer.

1793
02:36:45.48 --> 02:36:47.68
I'm just letting them know.

1794
02:36:47.68 --> 02:36:49.48
Let in everyone know.

1795
02:36:49.48 --> 02:36:50.64
Nonetheless, call the shirt locker.

1796
02:36:50.64 --> 02:36:51.64
It's on jockelstore.com.

02:36:51.64 --> 02:36:55.08
So, yes, I know for that, if you think that that's cool, if you think you want to represent

1798
02:36:55.08 --> 02:36:57.56
that way, that's a good deal.

1799
02:36:57.56 --> 02:36:58.56
We're out of there.

1800
02:36:58.56 --> 02:36:59.76

We got the ground in podcasts.

We got the warrior kid podcast.

1804
02:37:03.56 --> 02:37:07.16
We also have the jockel underground.

1805
02:37:07.16 --> 02:37:09.28
Jockel underground.com.

1806
02:37:09.28 --> 02:37:12.96
Where we give some of amplifying information.

1807
02:37:12.96 --> 02:37:15.76
Other things, different topics, different subjects behind the scenes.

1808
02:37:15.76 --> 02:37:17.76
We're setting up for a Q&A.

1809
02:37:17.76 --> 02:37:19.40
Yeah, and that's like questions.

1810
02:37:19.40 --> 02:37:20.40
Okay, so I get it.

1811
02:37:20.40 --> 02:37:22.44
Dave Burke, Jockel, excellent friend.

1812
02:37:22.44 --> 02:37:24.92
Again, there you can say, hey, how do I?

1813
02:37:24.92 --> 02:37:26.72
How do I get by in from the team, right?

1814
02:37:26.72 --> 02:37:27.72
That's a common one.

1815
02:37:27.72 --> 02:37:31.56
It doesn't have to be pro questions about like work, what did it work?

1816
02:37:31.56 --> 02:37:33.28
It can be outside of work.

1817
02:37:33.28 --> 02:37:34.28
Yeah.

1818
02:37:34.28 --> 02:37:35.84
Anyway, we're setting that up.

1819
02:37:35.84 --> 02:37:36.84
Yeah, it's set up.

1820
02:37:36.84 --> 02:37:40.20
So, go to questions at jockel underground.com.

1821
02:37:40.20 --> 02:37:41.52
So, be your question.

1822
02:37:41.52 --> 02:37:44.08
So, mid-Audio or video question, too.

1823
02:37:44.08 --> 02:37:46.44
Dude, that's proactive.

1824
02:37:46.44 --> 02:37:47.76
You just made that happen.

1825
02:37:47.76 --> 02:37:49.48
The squad leader makes a difference.

1826
02:37:49.48 --> 02:37:50.76
That's a good difference, yes, sir.

1827
02:37:50.76 --> 02:37:52.44
I'm trying over here doing a bit.

1828
02:37:52.44 --> 02:37:54.40
Are you the troopers squad leader?

1829
02:37:54.40 --> 02:38:03.44
If you want to get all this and you want to support us, you can go to jockel underground.com

1830
02:38:03.44 --> 02:38:09.92
across $8 and $18 a month, which is a number with layers.

1831
02:38:09.92 --> 02:38:12.88
And that just protects us from.

1832
02:38:12.88 --> 02:38:19.44
Number one, having to be a slave to sponsors.

1833
02:38:19.44 --> 02:38:26.40
Protects us from people saying they didn't want to host us anymore.

1834
02:38:26.40 --> 02:38:27.40
They can try it.

1835
02:38:27.40 --> 02:38:28.40
We got it.

1836
02:38:28.40 --> 02:38:29.80
We'll be standing by.

1837
02:38:29.80 --> 02:38:31.12
Execute contingency plan.

1838
02:38:31.12 --> 02:38:33.28
So thanks everyone that's supporting on that.

1839
02:38:33.28 --> 02:38:35.20
We got a YouTube channel.

1840
02:38:35.20 --> 02:38:39.36
We got a YouTube channel that echo Charles.

1841
02:38:39.36 --> 02:38:44.60
He makes videos and I am the assistant director of the Good ones, which is important

1842
02:38:44.60 --> 02:38:49.56
to know also origin BJJ has it.

1843
02:38:49.56 --> 02:38:50.56
Some cool videos up as well.

1844
02:38:50.56 --> 02:38:51.56
Check that one out.

1845
02:38:51.56 --> 02:38:52.56
You got that one.

1846
02:38:52.56 --> 02:38:53.56
Okay.

1847
02:38:53.56 --> 02:38:54.56
Also, psychological warfare.

1848
02:38:54.56 --> 02:38:58.20
Now, I'll don't forget about this, okay?

1849
02:38:58.20 --> 02:39:03.24
Sometimes we can shy away from the support that we need.

1850
02:39:03.24 --> 02:39:06.36
As you can see, sometimes we need the support.

1851
02:39:06.36 --> 02:39:12.04
We want to slip on the diet, skip the workout, turn a workout into a rest day, let's

1852
02:39:12.04 --> 02:39:13.56
face it, that's a thing.

1853
02:39:13.56 --> 02:39:14.56
Anyway.

1854
02:39:14.56 --> 02:39:19.52
Project Warfare is an album where Jack was telling you why you just shouldn't do that.

1855
02:39:19.52 --> 02:39:20.52
And then you won't do it.

1856
02:39:20.52 --> 02:39:22.04
So you know, you can find that on Amazon.

1857
02:39:22.04 --> 02:39:26.64
And you know, where everybody MP3's boom, psychological warfare is there.

1858
02:39:26.64 --> 02:39:29.44
Also, flipsidegames.com.

1859
02:39:29.44 --> 02:39:34.04
My brother Dakota Meyer making cool stuff to hang on your wall.

1860
02:39:34.04 --> 02:39:35.32
The coolest stuff to hang on your wall.

1861
02:39:35.32 --> 02:39:38.20
You're going to hang something on your wall is if you're going to hang something

1862
02:39:38.20 --> 02:39:42.32
on your wall, don't you want to look at it and say that's from Dakota Meyer.

1863
02:39:42.32 --> 02:39:43.32
Yes.

1864
02:39:43.32 --> 02:39:44.32
That's 100%.

1865
02:39:44.32 --> 02:39:46.20
I can't believe I've never said that before.

1866
02:39:46.20 --> 02:39:47.20
Yes.

1867
02:39:47.20 --> 02:39:48.20
That's 100% what I want.

1868
02:39:48.20 --> 02:39:49.20
I'm hanging something on my wall.

1869
02:39:49.20 --> 02:39:51.20
I want it to be from Dakota Meyer.

1870
02:39:51.20 --> 02:39:52.20
Yeah.

1871
02:39:52.20 --> 02:39:53.20
I agree with that.

1872
02:39:53.20 --> 02:39:54.20
Flipsidegames.com.

1873
02:39:54.20 --> 02:39:56.36
If you want that, we got a bunch of books.

1874
02:39:56.36 --> 02:39:58.64
Final spin.

1875
02:39:58.64 --> 02:40:00.20
What is it?

1876
02:40:00.20 --> 02:40:02.92
It's a, it's a knob.

1877
02:40:02.92 --> 02:40:04.24
Dave, assessment.

1878
02:40:04.24 --> 02:40:05.56
You've read final spin.

1879
02:40:05.56 --> 02:40:06.88
Oh, I have.

1880
02:40:06.88 --> 02:40:07.88
Assessment.

1881
02:40:07.88 --> 02:40:12.64
I'd actually kind of secretly want to know where I sit in the log of readers where I'm.

1882
02:40:12.64 --> 02:40:14.36
I actually, I know what I haven't got.

1883
02:40:14.36 --> 02:40:16.36
You haven't got you the final version.

1884
02:40:16.36 --> 02:40:17.36
The final version.

1885
02:40:17.36 --> 02:40:18.36
So I finally got it.

1886
02:40:18.36 --> 02:40:21.04
It is not just a book.

1887
02:40:21.04 --> 02:40:23.20
I can tell you that for sure.

1888
02:40:23.20 --> 02:40:24.56
Interesting.

1889
02:40:24.56 --> 02:40:27.56
It is, they're going to have a hard time figuring out where to put this one on the

1890
02:40:27.56 --> 02:40:28.56
bookshelf.

1891
02:40:28.56 --> 02:40:29.56
Yes.

1892
02:40:29.56 --> 02:40:31.48
They put it over there and they put it over there and the, yeah.

1893
02:40:31.48 --> 02:40:32.48
Like where does it go?

1894
02:40:32.48 --> 02:40:34.04
They have a hard time.

1895
02:40:34.04 --> 02:40:41.68
My validation that it wasn't just me just digging what I was reading is I shared it with my

1896
02:40:41.68 --> 02:40:46.88
wife, which I got to be honest, I don't, there's not a lot of crossover in my world that

1897
02:40:46.88 --> 02:40:47.88
I'm doing that.

1898
02:40:47.88 --> 02:40:48.88
I don't share all this up with my wife.

1899
02:40:48.88 --> 02:40:49.88
We got enough stuff going on.

1900
02:40:49.88 --> 02:40:52.16
I don't like, you know, bum barger with the work stuff.

1901
02:40:52.16 --> 02:40:53.96
You're not talking about battles in the bond soon.

1902
02:40:53.96 --> 02:40:54.96
Nope.

1903
02:40:54.96 --> 02:40:55.96
I'm not, how is the podcast?

1904
02:40:55.96 --> 02:40:56.96
It was awesome.

1905
02:40:56.96 --> 02:40:57.96
Okay, cool.

1906
02:40:57.96 --> 02:40:58.96
What do I need to do around the house?

1907
02:40:58.96 --> 02:40:59.96
How can I help?

1908
02:40:59.96 --> 02:41:01.40
I know it's been gone for seven hours.

1909
02:41:01.40 --> 02:41:04.44
I shared this with her and she just burned through it.

1910
02:41:04.44 --> 02:41:08.28
I think in two days, you know, and burned through it was like 10 o'clock and I get's in the

1911
02:41:08.28 --> 02:41:11.000
bed and she says up way too late and finishes in two nights.

1912
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.68
She just like, that was really good.

1913
02:41:12.68 --> 02:41:16.52
That's when I knew like my version of it being good had to be validated by a totally

1914
02:41:16.52 --> 02:41:20.88
disinterested third party with no bias.

1915
02:41:20.88 --> 02:41:22.04
She was totally still.

1916
02:41:22.04 --> 02:41:26.60
Well, interestingly, my mom.

1917
02:41:26.60 --> 02:41:29.72
So you would think what you just said, like, oh, bias, right?

1918
02:41:29.72 --> 02:41:32.04
You'd think, oh, I send it to my mom.

1919
02:41:32.04 --> 02:41:34.12
That's a given, right?

1920
02:41:34.12 --> 02:41:35.84
You know my mom.

1921
02:41:35.84 --> 02:41:39.16
My mom knows like, it's because she was an English teacher.

1922
02:41:39.16 --> 02:41:41.92
And so she's just there to just, she's just there.

1923
02:41:41.92 --> 02:41:44.32
I would say throw darts, but she's not there to throw darts.

1924
02:41:44.32 --> 02:41:46.92
She's there to hook machetes at your work.

1925
02:41:46.92 --> 02:41:49.12
I got my work, right?

1926
02:41:49.12 --> 02:41:56.08
And so I sent it to her for a final read and she sent me a text that said, like, halfway

1927
02:41:56.08 --> 02:41:57.96
done, I am loving this book.

1928
02:41:57.96 --> 02:41:59.24
That was complete shock.

1929
02:41:59.24 --> 02:42:00.24
Yeah.

1930
02:42:00.24 --> 02:42:05.52
In fact, I don't lay for about it because life was with me in New York City when extreme

1931
02:42:05.52 --> 02:42:09.12
ownership made number number one New York Times bestseller.

1932
02:42:09.12 --> 02:42:14.52
Which is like sort of the thing, the cool thing for a book, right?

1933
02:42:14.52 --> 02:42:18.32
And I called my parents on speakerphone and, and, and,

1934
02:42:18.32 --> 02:42:20.80
Lafes like Santa and their list, I'm like, hey, I just want to let you guys know, you

1935
02:42:20.80 --> 02:42:25.12
know, we made New York Times bestseller and us, you know, with the book that I wrote with

1936
02:42:25.12 --> 02:42:30.12
Lafes and my mom's like, oh, we'll see how long it's on their phone.

1937
02:42:30.12 --> 02:42:32.12
I was like, cool.

1938
02:42:32.12 --> 02:42:34.88
Yeah, I guess we will.

1939
02:42:34.88 --> 02:42:36.76
So a positive review.

1940
02:42:36.76 --> 02:42:37.76
Yeah.

1941
02:42:37.76 --> 02:42:41.68
And it will be interesting, you know, you go into a bookstore and have, I guess categories,

1942
02:42:41.68 --> 02:42:44.36
whatever they, yeah, yeah, I'll be interested in seeing where they put it.

1943
02:42:44.36 --> 02:42:45.36
I will too.

1944
02:42:45.36 --> 02:42:47.12
It's going to be, it's going to be very interesting.

1945
02:42:47.12 --> 02:42:48.12
So we got that.

1946
02:42:48.12 --> 02:42:52.08
If you want to pre-order that thing, it's also, it's all, let way, why pre-order?

1947
02:42:52.08 --> 02:42:56.12
Well, so you can get it because once again, we don't want you to not get it.

1948
02:42:56.12 --> 02:42:59.84
We don't, you want definitely don't want you to not get a first edition.

1949
02:42:59.84 --> 02:43:02.28
Let's be, deal.

1950
02:43:02.28 --> 02:43:09.28
When you, you want that first edition.

1951
02:43:09.28 --> 02:43:10.28
And here's the other thing.

1952
02:43:10.28 --> 02:43:14.28
The publisher, my publisher.

1953
02:43:14.28 --> 02:43:16.28
Do you think their nervous about this?

1954
02:43:16.28 --> 02:43:18.28
They are nervous.

1955
02:43:18.28 --> 02:43:22.28
They're nervous because they're like, you, you, you, you just wrote a Swiss write leadership books.

1956
02:43:22.28 --> 02:43:23.28
I'm like, what about all this?

1957
