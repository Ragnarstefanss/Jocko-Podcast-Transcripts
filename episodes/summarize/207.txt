and And proud of myself for You know, always you know really Striving to Treat every single person no matter what the circumstance with love and respect and now You know I'm starting to get a little bit of gray just turn 30 Lookin over this long you know salty life I Looking back, you know, I do feel like now I'm finally starting to get to a place where Looking back, I do realize that It's not a bad thing at all to Be If you want to say soft or A square or you know, whatever it is and When the times as a marine in Afghanistan When I've Needed to be when I was called upon When that was appropriate for that situation and that mission I feel like Going into a room first with the saw Kicking in the door I have a couple of hand grenades on my On my plate carrier You know, I That was me at that time, but now I do feel like I've gotten it as far as I have in life and I've done as well as I have Obviously with the amazing support team and the people that picked me out when I stumbled You know, but Aside from that, I do feel like My softness, I guess Has Got me to an incredible place in life You know, there's a saying Which I was thinking of as you were talking about that The saying is And they think all that that kids a whip or that kids, you know, what's the word I'm looking for that kids, you know a goody two shoes Right or a square something like that and what you're proof that That's wrong actually you know that this that you can be raised that way and you can be tough as nails Because I think the reputation of someone that would say those things Let me pretty this way I got a 16 year old son he wouldn't say those things because he'd think I don't want my friends to think I don't want my friends to think I'm you know soft I'm done you know, that's the way it is you know he wouldn't say love your mama Maybe what a little bit I don't really remember it Which is crazy to have this incredible amount of focus on your life story On a situation that you don't remember and I've been knocked out before and I mean I imagine this is just like the absolute worst knockout a person can can get And you know you wake up and you go away where am I you know I've been knocked out and just you know come to go and know Wait a second where am I and that's basically what what you had Yeah, and you're exactly right it is you know at in the beginning after five weeks later after I woke up after those what I thought or my final moments on that roof It used to frustrate me that I couldn't remember and I don't I don't think it would if there were no external influences But knowing that the Marine Corps the military department of defense and In a way the whole country and world we're looking into talking about examining Parts of your life that you can't remember was wild and You know, but as with everything I tried to not only see both sides, but really think through it And thankfully and eventually I just realized how wrong of a mindset that was and not only is it understandable that I don't remember anything I just taken a grenade to the face you're learning about work, you know, this is this is what it is And also learn to appreciate once again, you know what we talk about being raised in a sheltered situation You know, that's that's what that is you don't understand what goes into that Chicken patty that's coming on to your plate at night, you know, we get a factory up in Maine and there's what we make close, you know, and you people don't realize oh somebody somebody made that somebody showed that You know, many people you know, stitched their fingers and injured themselves just trying to make a pair of jeans or a time away from their family Exactly, of course it's a job, but still but just You know things that unless you enter our world You know on the other side of it are not only powerful but incredible to listen to to think about to try to even not don't think you're Effectively can but to try to you know visualize or put yourself in those situations like You know running to your objective what are you talking about right now but just things like that that is leadership along with those stories of You know perseverance and just aggressiveness and determination all of that and it together made me Not only realize what a leader could be so That's what I think this this calls out to me, you know, is that this type of attitude that gets frowned upon And I guess that's a little bit of what you know when you were saying you didn't even know if you were to write about this stuff That's what I'm getting at like you say and I don't know if I'm right about this because it's a little bit but some people might you know not connect with it And, you know, to for a couple of months after I had initially kind of broke the news on what I was really thinking about And considering like you said, we were in a time of two serious conflicts And who knows where things were going to go from there with all of these terrible and just unreal things happening around the world And for a couple of months you know, to see my mom in the morning I dreaded walking into the living room and seeing her eyes red and swollen And knowing that she had been crying through the night to herself Because she was so scared and so concerned For if I was going to do this, you know, at the time I think she was thinking hopefully not you You You know you talk a little bit about your attitude going in And you know you say this it's not hard to feel invincible first the Marine Corps trains you so well that you know you are part of one of the most elite fighting forces on earth It seems impossible that 40 year old Soviet weapons and homemade detonating devices of the Taliban could possibly pose a serious risk You're in your late teens or early 20s and the risk rewards center of the brain has not fully developed so the possibility of danger seems Thrilling rather than sobering it's hard to think about death when the world seems so full of life possibility and excitement You feel invincible because up to this point you've basically have been broken arm from falling out of a tree fort no problem The doctors can fix you right up by putting you in a cast for a month Conclusion from a bad hit and football concerning but you'll be back in a few weeks When that is your frame of reference it's hard to imagine the degree of injury that might be waiting you that might be awaiting you If you can imagine it it still seems like something that would happen to someone else The problem is that you are everyone else is someone else And so right there immediately just from hangar nades and not even leaving Our four walls of our patrol base we were down three guys and we had all gone down there with a Squad and arguably a small squad and our mission and we did this to give people listening context We were over the halfway point of our deployment When you're you know we stood three months, but when you're you can see the end inside You know that at seven months whether you want to or not your times up you're going back home And another unit is going to come in and relieve you To prepare for that and to continue to Keep the momentum going of an efficient mission Just like with anything in live hopefully you want to leave it better than you found it And they have the self assurance that they don't need to You know, what makes someone walk around with their chest You know, push out, act and like they're tough Most of the time those tough guys are act and like they're tough Because they're insecure about something That's what's going on And so when people actually have When people are kind, it's because they're secure I can tell you like I train you jitsu But you don't want to look around and survey and look for And discover who that is 50 minutes for the Evac to get there You continue on a few hours later this is after the Caches the evacuation a few hours later after the sun and set I was on my shift as radio watch back at patrol base Abitly listening to information as it came in from the Marines who were outside of the wire during the silence of breaks in the radio traffic I couldn't help but let my mind wander back to the hour before was since and still alive How would his wife and family handle the news would I be able to survive something like that if it if or when it happened to me As my brain raised to compartmentalize the recent past my present reality suddenly became even worse Loose dirt crumbled out of the cracks in the wall as the room shook A second later the sound of a massive explosion reached us more than a mile away Lance Corporal Dakota Hughes had been making his way through the dark fields and tree lines with his squad on night patrol They were moving toward a village to our south the Taliban would flood fields in order to make it harder for us to advance quickly The inundated fields didn't slow down our tall guys much because the water was only about as high as their boots But for shorter guys like Dakota and me the water was up to our ankles and even our calves at times Between the water our 22 pound squad automatic weapons 20 to 30 pounds of machine gun ammo and 45 pounds of gear It was hard to move quickly and the Taliban knew that As Hughes and his squad approached the village he reached a goat path a small trail that surrounds an agricultural field And allows locals to travel through the patchwork of land without triggering their crops Stepping onto it a few moments later 19 year old Dakota from Greenwood Louisiana took his last step And breath on this earth so this Do you find out immediately that you know that he was KIA? And then volunteer to be in Sagan Vietnam and I was I said you know well, you know, was it hard to get selected and he was like You know, he goes it was Vietnam, you know, the survival rate of an officer in Vietnam was like nothing Yeah, you know, you said it seems like no big deal, you know high school football or whatever This is one of the reasons that I've written a bunch of kids books one of the reasons that I wrote a bunch of kids books is because one day I was talking to my kids One of my kids about something and what I realized, you know, I was like in the military I don't know they run I'm going to run this women I'm going to swim What you know what I said so such they say that that party of brain isn't fully developed until you're like 25 maybe years It was a little bit earlier maybe mine was a little bit later because you were way more introspective than I ever was I was like a knuckle dragger You know but once I did I immediately felt welcome and loved in that family and from day one I feel like I thrived and Just again met some really amazing people that I still keep in touch with the day and that still Show me that same amount of love and support as they did on that first day and it's actually not in the book another example of how small it is You know and through the writing in the contract we had 75,000 words But as we went along through the two years you know you really dive into deep thought and self-reflection And if I saw a guy it didn't happen it happened for probably like six months when I would see like a young new guy seal standing in the middle of the street with no cover I would get I would feel sick to my stomach like I just a real like a sickness I would come over me because I would think that they're going to get shot, you know, and I'd go for no big I need to get some cover. But also You know When a debt seed started that fire and kind of gave me that burning of of knowing that there is more out there and seeing what maybe with hard work and dedication I could become not his specifically but just how he carried himself And the way he you know even as sanitation supervisor at a culture processing facility you know that leadership that he brought everyday and How all of those under him were not only structured but extremely effective and I never I hung out in office a lot probably because I got so many cool stories but you know I never but no hey on this bus ride home there's going to be a lot of empty seats And to know that and know that your emotions and your attitude is going to potentially dictate or affect how many of the seats there are on the way back It's a heavy dose of a reality check There's a line in the book that I didn't read earlier but it's when you're having the discussions with your parents about joining the military And like your mom says something along and you've got the quote in there I'm going to butcher it and I think a lot of it is attitude and again kind of like I said at the beginning You know what even though we signed up for it we raised our right hand You can do the research you know we're in a time of two conflicts and two different On two different fronts and two different countries and you know or I'm just talking about joining the Marine Corps just that right there You know there's I guess what I'm thinking about is the stereotypical spoiled kid That's never going to do anything like that Didn't it doesn't have to be that way right and the other the other thing I like about this is Respect your respect your father love your mama stick tight to your brothers always do your best always be honest never talk back There's kids that there's kids that look at a kid like that Good could be a potential moment downrange Just a couple months later that you know not for y'all You know training is obviously longer, but you know in the short term For every mistake that you weren't so harsh on him for Could be a life altering or life ending You know, I'm a state that could have been corrected before Because you know, I need to be in this world, but you know, I've I believe learn and realize over time that And this is just me personally, but You know, I should I do You know deeply care about people So I think I realized these even though I did at the time I realized them Less than and more later on Yeah, the reflection when you look back and for me I've been doing a lot of that you know I got this book that I just wrote leadership strategy in tactics and I start off by explaining How I transition I don't use these words because I just thought it's today, but how I transition from learning like a dog Which is you know kind of how it started to saying oh, and I don't think until you know you go through the things that you do through your life of service You can fully comprehend or get mentally prepared or ready for So just to know Hey, I know what I know and I said all that looks you know this is a cool warm movie I watched every warm movie I could possibly watch and then that opening scene of The opening scene which is 45 minutes long of full metal jacket In my mind it would I would think oh if you saw that you'd know what was coming right you'd know like But over the long term Being kind of people and helping people out of me and look at the support network that you just talked about Those people were supporting you Obviously they're doing it because they're good people but they're also doing it because you're a good person You know that little extra effort when they say hey this guy's a good human being this guy said, hi me this guy was nice to me this guy didn't flip out when I made a mistake like And you got this in the book like any successful and efficient organization the Marine Corps emphasizes leadership at the foundational level with every Marine train and ready to take over the job Above them if the situation calls for it this appealed to me as being a part of the military the discipline that shapes recruits in deleders Obviously the way the Marine Corps does it is not the most pleasant approach But it has a remarkable success rate that you've talked about this I was honored to be named a squad leader early on and hold that position through graduation If the DIs decide you have earned the right to stay in that role and you graduate as a squad leader You will leave boot camp at the rank of private first class rather than private It is an honor, but it does come with its drawbacks You help maintain order, but you also have to share the punishment with anyone in your squad who needs to be disciplined If one of the your guys is told the S.D. pull up pushups you have to be there doing them right alongside him That was one of the best lessons in leadership the Marine Corps taught me a true leader is not someone who keeps themselves separate from the people they lead He or she is right in the middle of what the team is going through Experiencing the lows as well as the highs with everyone else And then the chances of getting Actually hurt wounded or killed Or are are relatively small Compared to what it looks like in Hollywood movie You know in Hollywood movie it's like everyone's going to fight everyone's going to war Everyone's getting blown up That's what happens in the movies It's not like that in the real military And You know, I I do feel like maybe I'm a little t-nice at times, but You know, for That one time every once in a while that I might get walked all over you know, there's a hundred times that I'm thankful I already, I'm still excited and looking forward to keep going, but with that said, I appreciate you having me in this time and helping me with your platform, with that mission of helping people through that struggle and telling people, and telling people that, one small step at a time, you work hard, try to stay positive, try to be a good person, do the right thing, and you know, it will not only bring you out of that, but take you to great places. I know it's like you know it's going to happen The unknown of just thinking Because what let's face it What Hollywood can portray the military to be like Is a lot different from what the military really is hey We're going to step up the game in Afghanistan you guys kind of know what that means Since you guys are prepared basically prepared for deployment because you're on a little mini deployment So you guys figure if there's troops are going to Afghanistan for this surge thing going on It's probably going to be us you say here. And you know my dad has has struggled before and maybe still does a little with the fact that You know maybe moving me around so much and and you know the fact that I was unhappy during that Influential time in my life that that kind of led me to join the military But just keeping you know that rhythm that you know in your comfortable with and then you know we would have those transitional periods where You know we might go for night patrol to early afternoon patrol That long term that kindness is going to win every single time at long term like I said short term there's going to be some some Jerk that's going to walk around and push around and it's like okay everyone just saw what just happened and when you come back here into the store or into the situation and you want a little extra help from somebody and you can as you start as you read this book you put those pieces together and you can kind of see it form it's awesome Continuing on here There were certain sounds I never would have imagined that I could tune out like AK47's being shot at me with the intent to kill but at some point your brain starts Registering certain input as more of a nuisance than a threat Besides bullets were not our main concern we were focused on avoiding the IEDs that were stretched across roadways walking paths and inside of walls They taken quite a toll on two nine on September 30 if Lance Corporal Timothy M Jackson had been killed by an IED Then in mid November IEDs had taken out two more of our guys One of those remarkable Marines was our squad leader Zach Stinson who stepped on an IED That had been placed underground near a wall that separated two villages the scariest thing about the IED is that without a metal detector a well placed one can be almost impossible to spot even in broad daylight You lucky if the person who placed the IED is in experienced or lazy because they will lead leave red flags like disturbed dirt or a small trash pile that looks like it might have been constructed to hide something At about one PM we were walking on patrol through one of the dried up irrigation canals that crisscross the landscape We were scanning the terrain for town abandon making our way toward the next town we needed to secure when another dreaded explosion went off The shockwave of the blast rippled through our patrol. You know I had Jim Web on here who is the Navy Cross recipient Marine Corps, but you know his story He's like goes finishes the Naval Academy goes to the basic school goes to their little short Infect condensed infantry course that's like 11 weeks long gets 13 days leave flies to Vietnam Yeah absolutely Even you know some people They think that you're they think that 20 years In the military is 20 years in boot camp This what they think they think it's 20 years of people yelling in screaming at you and it's like And they all end up in the military and it's you still even with all those diverse backgrounds it's hard to predict One a person's actually going to be like what what what that person is actually going to be like and you know you meet some kid from the hood And you know we'd get bad seats like on an aircraft And I would call up the the dang help desk of Delta or of America whoever whatever airline and I would spend at least the first like two minutes of saying hey, how you do you know they'd say how can I help you and I'd say oh How you do like oh you know if I want this to happen I need to do that like I don't you know your dog isn't saying your dog isn't philosophizing about how to get another treat Maybe 140 that the most I had done it I had accomplished the thing I had dedicated the last three years of my life to pursuing I was a lady and I was all it was elating and it was also incredibly deflating We just learned that my family was moving to South Carolina in a matter of weeks So your dad worked in the Poetry industry and just like with a lot of the business world out there you move up do good things get promotions and sometimes that comes with moving around which Every other time before that kind of moving across the southeast and gradually making it South Carolina Every other time before that was an adventure There's always the I guess nerves and kind of dread of going and walking into that class as the new kid especially in elementary middle school years Let's just say For the next four months every single day that we were getting some That is the one and only and last time I ever was in the prone position All 800 rounds every single day out of my soul roughly everything was just standing from that point on And not only did I immediately feel more vulnerable than I just in the prone position That's how we train, that's how we shot most of the time I'd never really just let loose from the standing And so that really wasn't even kind of an idea in my head so just doing A lot of things like in life on the job and the military you learn a lot of the most important lessons And kind of the tricks of the trade as you go along And laying in the prone surrounded by Taliban is not the way to do it At least it wasn't for me during that deployment and you know had a fantasy about being in the seal team so he enlisted Even though his dad you know has 10 houses, but that's what he does and you just can't tell what that person's character is going to be like based on how they were raised That's that's just the way it is. They're all these things all these principles And one of the things I said was sometimes when people hear me say hey Your people should say hey who they should want to know why we're doing something and that scares some bosses Because some bosses you know if Kyle comes to me and says hey why are we doing this? You say here again I'm always impressed with your perspective as a young Marine there You say I think a lot about the afghan people who were threatened with violence if they didn't raise a gun against the Americans On the surface it would be easy to classify them all as the enemy but some of them just wanted to be left alone to raise their families in peace How quickly did I dismiss people based on circumstances I didn't fully understand And what about the way people react to extremely high stress high stakes situations previously I might have regarded someone's panic or coping mechanisms as a sign of weakness But that was before I ever I had never lived with this kind of pressure and trauma before I know now how the horrific casualties I witnessed deeply impacted me, but what about the perspective of the guy who got hit? but I would take my son to training sites when I was training guys and the teams and platoons and I think the first time he Listen to me give a debrief to a seal-potune His eyes were as big as sauce or plates man because I you know they start running away crying like he's playing when he fell like he's getting the new brother He came up to me and he said You know because I talked about look, you know you got to explain to people why they got to understand You got to let them come up with a plan. but I want to Reading about your story, you know it's like I kept smiling to myself and saying Man this is this is that chance, you know this is that chance to talk to somebody That for all practical purposes there's no possible way that you should survive There's just it just doesn't make sense That's why I use the term miracle We didn't jump into patrols on day one there was a kind of leadership training down period The higher ranking Marines went out on patrol first to get a feel for things before leading patrols of their own It was a way to help everyone get acclimated to being outside the wire But our step our time to step into an active role came quickly enough my first patrol took place four or five days after we arrived We stopped at a compound at the end of a road after pausing to talk to the owner about his family in the area And whether or not he'd seen Taliban nearby You guys set up security here and as I land my stomach behind my gun scanning the landscape I remember thinking that the field before me was a perfect rectangle as if it had been laid out with a ruler In a region where there's so much where so much a scatter shot adapted to the land it was unusual to see something so precise It was oddly beautiful all of a sudden it was as if the skies had opened and the clouds were dumping hail so many rounds We're hitting the ground around me that I couldn't even see through my scope for all the dust they were kicking up There was a funk as a bullet ricochet off the side of a shed and at almost exactly the same time I felt something hit my lower back about two inches to the right of my spine Just above my belt line and below my body armor probably only an inch of skin Probably the only inch of skin that wasn't protected. You don't have to know where you're going, you know how that, the perfect plan, you don't have to know it tomorrow holds. But yeah, you know I'm I could have written the entire book about my parents I'm so thankful that they've been there from the moment I was born And from the moment that I woke up again to this beautiful bonus round that I'm living now Awesome, continue along with the book I guess we wanted siblings but that proved a particularly elusive goal marked with a lot of loss The hardest was a stillborn baby boy when I was four I'd been over the moon about getting a little brother and crushed when it didn't happen But you can imagine how devastated my parents were To lose a child and feel completely powerless as it is happening has got to be one of life's greatest agonies Finally two months after my six birthday my mom gave birth to twin boys They named Price and Peyton and I was smitten I could not imagine anything in the world more special than getting two siblings and you know I I've actually explained this to people before Because you know in the in the military we get people from every background in life Every different background in life everything kids from the ghetto kids from the hood kids from the farm and you know it's a good thing Because you know we didn't know what what was in store for us Just to have that mutual respect understanding and that efficiency of working together as a team It's not only vital and essential Potentially you know in history as far as American forces go And no one had really been there since the Soviets in the 70s and so Because we were there so early on You know Looking ahead the angle is you want to And the big picture give these people a better life Help them to wake up every day and not live in fear And to hopefully see that better and brighter future But to get to that you have to create stability and a foundation He was in charge of of sanitation for the plant and a leader like none I had met before Before he was rough around the edges and authentic he rolled up his sleeves and worked alongside his team whenever an extra set of hands was needed He wasn't above-grime or hard work since workers at the plant were from various walks of life He learned to relate to his people in order to be able to communicate effectively with them rather than getting frustrated at the differences in everyone's backgrounds He believed that his workers would respect him more if he was able to connect with them directly He also believed that they would do their job their own job more efficiently if they weren't afraid to ask him for clarification That's a little decentralized command, you know, hey boss why are we doing this can you explain this to me? I mean the fact that you joined the Marine Corps right You had a nice up bringing you had no reason to say oh I'm not I'm going to leave college I'm going to go in the Marine Corps I'm going to be a grant the Marine Corps like That's there's a fine line right with raising kids and I got four kids You know you'd be nice, you know how you know when you're communicating someone be nice because that's how you get people to listen to you Like that that I finally succumb to the fight and actually, you know, is this really, really happening, you know, because last time I remember before this hallucination started, I was struggling to hang on to life. I can I can be a leader I didn't even think of it in those words, but I thought I like to make the calls, you know, I can make calls I even think of that word yet and then luckily, well, you kind of went through a similar experience to me and we'll get to it Where you had a bad leader and then you transferred to a good leader or you had a good leader come in I'm thankful that You know besides seeing Whiten-grace static and my ears ringing and not being disoriented Not knowing what happened You know all of those stalls We're only going on on my head And all of that really happened in just a few seconds And the most profound Couple of things that I do remember And at the time It was just Too heavy in my mind and with the blood loss To even halfway process or comprehend And then he walks up there goes hey, I'm here to take over for the Petune Commanders Dad welcome aboard this is Sergeant you know Smith and he's been running things and then that night They got like into a heavy contact and he was on the radio calling danger close fire support that night 12 hours, but it's only grand crazy that ain't it crazy does not and that shows you how efficient the Marine Corps is that you could take a guy like that and you know I think do I self-ful that person's probably going to be somewhere Who knows what they've got going on in their life whatever they got kids or whatever So fine They might win in that situation right there And there's not really that in between so Being ignorant or military medicine especially that some of who are going to be down the road some of my best doctors that saved my life and my limbs And kept me here They were going to be wearing camouflage Air force army Navy doctors But to wake up and not know That military medicine world is out there along with the injuries disorientation and The medication which probably was the no one factor I had a extremely hard time trying to come out of The ICU fog and hallucinations thinking that my parents had lost everything had spent everything Couldn't provide those meals and food on the table for my brothers that's that's that's that's an interesting way to get broken into the teams Yeah, especially because you know we were talking about earlier like the amount of combat that you may or may not see in a career You know you if your first deployment is to Ramadi that's gonna be it's gonna be tough and then halfway through it Yeah, especially when he was the one that You know you always have those leaders Journalist instructors that are extra hard on you and seem to always pick on you pick you out And up until that moment I felt like it was his mission every day waking up even though at the time we didn't even think that that those guys slept But his mission waking up every day to destroy recruit car and I although I did see him get out get dirty, you know get down on his hands and these work show us how to do certain things and supervise for every one time he left his office, you know that guy his right hand man came in 15, 20 times a day and we we say we've got some really exciting news for you all You know you're going to have another baby brother or sister and Their reaction the oldest daughter literally stood up and started crying and ran to a room that made my middle daughter stand up and go to her I've been my son just started crying right there in the spot It was like we delivered in the world I was kind of sad but you know people actually know what are you really doing while you're going out there What we're doing while you are outside of your base And the simple answer is we would go out every day I mean You know, sometimes people look at a challenging situation, you know, and they say, well, it's going to take me a long time to get this done. And it was like, you know, I want to be a machine gunner You know, you joined the Marine Corps Everyone was a rifleman in the Marine Corps Okay, well I want to be a machine gunner And I realized that there's two things that made me realize it but one of us I worked had a guy on the podcast name Jim Mukayama who is a Army guy and he worked for David Hackworth and anyways he became a general but he was like one of the leadership principles that he talks about I was like it is like the most important things that you care about your people So I have that in the back of my mind And you know it's stuff that you picked up on, you know like I always say I didn't invent any of this stuff from a leadership that has been around for since human beings It's been trying to surround the damn lion on the plains and kill it, right? and you felt like you leaned a little bit towards this could be a long seven months I would say completely towards a ladder You say that you know not every patrols that exciting you know And this kind of incert comes in Bigger had been turkey hunting that morning before school And had a big knife on it and it was just kind of like hey you know you can't have that year Let's take it back out to your truck like I think along with thinking us not going to happen to me also just not really being able to comprehend The possibilities that are very quickly and aggressively coming your way I think you know those two things is are the two biggest country butters to that mindset I guess we should be thankful that that mindset exists because otherwise I think you might go crazy And you know they'll start asking me questions about The workouts and that kind of thing You know enjoying the Sealtimes to work out You can work out at the gym You can work out at 24 hour fitness When you join the Sealtimes What you're doing the Sealtimes to do is kill people So you know say and and this is random numbers I don't know what they are but say our area of operation was was two square miles Looking ahead to that next deployment and leaving things better for them Then when you got there you want to expand your area of operation To continue to push that enemy out and continue that mission of creating stability Which we've we've already talked about well, my mind is open and my mind is open and there's something that I realized I did a little research and the the root word of motivation, which we know motivation is like it comes across as an emotion or feeling that's what I like about it because we can't rely on it, right? You with Nick, it phrase you, my best friend was out on the canal and exposed when all of a sudden bullets started to hail down on us We began while we began manning the VCP Taliban had set up three shooters no more than a hundred yards away at different angles in what's called a bare paw formation to try and triangulate and wipe us out We could see their heads as they ran along the canals by the tree line I happened to be positioned by the compound on the other side of the road Lance Corporal Stranger the team leader at the time peered over the edge of the canal to see if our guys could safely return fire When his head flew backward like he'd been punched it looked like a bullet had gone straight into his forehead For a moment he sat perfectly still blinking in a days then he shook it off Miraculously the bullet had struck his helmet and the Kevlar had done its job warping the track of the bullet so that it skimmed the edge of his helmet rather than lodging in his skull I had a 200 round drum ready already loaded onto my squad automatic weapon I think he spent It wasn't just a four year term He spent some significant time in It seems to me like In many cases it would be harder for parents that don't Like if your kid joined the military or my kid joined the military It'd be like
