00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.32 This is Jocco podcast number 244 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening,
00:00:06.32 --> 00:00:11.84 echo. Good evening. And also joining me tonight is Mike Sarelli and George Randall.
00:00:11.84 --> 00:00:18.80 And if you haven't listened to, when Mike came on the podcast for the first time, go listen to that.
00:00:18.80 --> 00:00:27.36 It was number 134. Mike was in task in the bruiser in the battle of the body. And after that,
00:00:27.36 --> 00:00:34.88 he did another nine combat deployments. And he is part of our leadership consultancy,
00:00:34.88 --> 00:00:42.64 echelon front, where he also heads up our talent acquisition firm, which is called EF overwatch.
00:00:42.64 --> 00:00:50.96 Mike, welcome back. And also George Randall, is an army vet, came up through the ranks from
00:00:50.96 --> 00:00:56.000 enlisted to officer, which I guess we all have that in common. And then left the army for the
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.68 corporate world, where eventually we became a talent acquisition executive. That sounds impressive.
00:01:05.36 --> 00:01:10.16 Always keeping a focus on recruiting veterans and coaching them through the transition
00:01:10.88 --> 00:01:15.60 to civilian life. Now there's all kinds of things we could talk about. But today we're going
00:01:15.60 --> 00:01:21.36 to focus on, well, it's been one of the focuses that we've had for several years at echelon front.
00:01:21.36 --> 00:01:27.28 And it's a focus that you guys have taken and absolutely run with. And that is talent.
00:01:28.96 --> 00:01:34.56 It is finding, recruiting, acquiring and retaining the best people.
00:01:36.56 --> 00:01:42.40 Obviously, all those things are a subset of leadership. But it's a subset that both of you have
00:01:42.40 --> 00:01:50.32 been focused on. And it's a subset that gets left out a lot in people ignore it. And
00:01:50.32 --> 00:01:58.88 Mike, you, you, you started GFO Overwatch. And you guys got so possessed by this that you guys have
00:01:58.88 --> 00:02:06.72 just written a book. And the book is called The Talent War. And you've done a great job of
00:02:09.04 --> 00:02:12.96 covering, you know, this topic in the book. And I want to jump into it. And I'm going to do something
00:02:12.96 --> 00:02:18.48 right now that might be considered lame. I don't know. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm going to start
00:02:18.48 --> 00:02:26.000 with a quote from the book. But the quote that I'm going to start with from the book is a quote from me,
00:02:26.64 --> 00:02:31.84 because I wrote the forward. So maybe that's lame. But here it is. Leadership is the most important
00:02:31.84 --> 00:02:37.68 thing on the battlefield. And the most important thing in business and in life. It is leadership that
00:02:37.68 --> 00:02:43.04 sets the example. It is leadership that makes decisions. It is leadership that unifies a team around
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:48.96 a common goal. And it is leadership that takes care of the team and gets the mission done. But
00:02:48.96 --> 00:02:56.56 one of the most important roles of the leader is often overlooked. The responsibility of building
00:02:56.56 --> 00:03:04.16 the team in the first place. The leader is responsible for training, equipping, and directing a team.
00:03:04.16 --> 00:03:11.84 But before any of that is possible, the leader must recruit, screen, and acquire the right people
00:03:11.84 --> 00:03:20.32 for the team. And that's a little bit from the forward. And then it jumps into this book that you
00:03:20.32 --> 00:03:28.88 guys wrote. Before we jump into it, at what point did you start thinking that that we needed
00:03:28.88 --> 00:03:32.96 right about this, that we needed to do something about this? Were you thinking about this as you
00:03:32.96 --> 00:03:37.68 stood up, EFO Overwatch? As you guys started banging your heads together and moving forward with this,
00:03:37.68 --> 00:03:43.52 Mike, at what point did you start looking at, hey, we need to start telling people about talent
00:03:43.52 --> 00:03:48.80 and how they need to handle it as leaders? You know, I love how you just said it's a subset of
00:03:48.80 --> 00:03:53.52 leadership. But absolutely, as you just said, it's one of the most overlooked parts is before you even
00:03:53.52 --> 00:03:59.60 step out on an adventure. You got to formulate the team. And that's hard. And really,
00:04:01.52 --> 00:04:05.52 Georgia and I nerd out on this, where other people are talking about, you know, just you too.
00:04:05.52 --> 00:04:11.12 We're talking about talent acquisition. And if anyone calls me and nerd, I'll gladly provide
00:04:11.12 --> 00:04:17.04 my address. You can come out of a conversation with me. No, I'm joking. So the amount of companies
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:22.08 we run into that reach out to us and say, hey, we need help. And, you know, we're very genuine.
00:04:22.08 --> 00:04:27.36 We want to see our clients succeed. That's our primary goal. We also want to see our candidates
00:04:27.36 --> 00:04:35.28 you know, prosper in those positions that we place them in. But they are at a loss
00:04:36.32 --> 00:04:42.32 for what the correct steps are. And as we looked at it, it sort of out of frustration of wanting
00:04:42.32 --> 00:04:48.72 to help them and them not always following our guidance, we during our conversations, we talked about
00:04:48.72 --> 00:04:54.80 a lot about the special operations community and how it's taking them decades to create a world
00:04:54.80 --> 00:05:00.48 class talent acquisition process. Do they call it something different? It's not hiring. We call
00:05:00.48 --> 00:05:07.84 assessment and insolention. And so one day, I, you know, usually how I carry out my ideas. I was
00:05:07.84 --> 00:05:11.12 probably watching TV and something came in my head. I picked up the phone called Jordan said, hey,
00:05:11.12 --> 00:05:15.52 we should write a book on this. And he said, okay. And then we started researching it. You know,
00:05:15.52 --> 00:05:21.92 we didn't think all the way through it. You know, most of my ideas are half baked. And, you know,
00:05:21.92 --> 00:05:27.12 voila, we found somebody to assist us through the process because neither of us had written a book.
00:05:28.16 --> 00:05:32.08 I knew two guys at Roto Book, I didn't reach out to him, which was probably the biggest mistake.
00:05:32.08 --> 00:05:40.88 And we're learning a lot of that. The hard way, but this journey has been awesome. And it's
00:05:40.88 --> 00:05:45.92 actually solidified and changed some of the views we have on talent going through this process and
00:05:45.92 --> 00:05:51.84 all the interviews. So George, how did you two link up? Well, it was funny. I was actually listening
00:05:51.84 --> 00:05:58.80 to podcast 134. And so I'm listening to this. And then you all mentioned, you have overwatch
00:05:58.80 --> 00:06:04.32 in Austin. I'm like, you got to be kidding me. So I reached out to Mike Unlinkedin and I said, hey,
00:06:04.32 --> 00:06:09.60 you know what? We need some world class leaders where I work. You know, and he wrote back
00:06:09.60 --> 00:06:14.64 within minutes. And the next thing, you know, where it breakfast at Kirby Lane in Austin. And,
00:06:14.64 --> 00:06:21.12 you know, it was like, wow, I found my counterpart. I got somebody who thinks about talent like I do.
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.12 And it rapidly took off from there. You know, ultimately leading to the wedding, which at some point
00:06:29.12 --> 00:06:34.72 we might talk about. I didn't marry George. Let's just, there was no wedding. I'll let him continue.
00:06:34.72 --> 00:06:41.92 He asked I was already spoken for. So, but yeah, and we just really started to think, okay,
00:06:41.92 --> 00:06:47.76 how do we pair up my 20 years in talent acquisition in his 20 years in special operations? And
00:06:47.76 --> 00:06:54.16 there was just so much synergy there in an instant. And we were fortunate to see it and take off with it.
00:06:54.88 --> 00:06:59.84 Yeah, you know, from when Mike originally started talking to me and and late about, you know,
00:06:59.84 --> 00:07:04.88 doing something with talent acquisition for people, it was such a no-brainer because all of these
00:07:04.88 --> 00:07:08.72 companies we work with. We got to work with the company. We spent two days with them. And at the end,
00:07:08.72 --> 00:07:13.44 you know what they say? They say, we would really love to have a couple people with your backgrounds.
00:07:13.44 --> 00:07:17.52 Or, you know, do you know what we can find people? We were getting, we heard that for years and years
00:07:17.52 --> 00:07:22.88 and years. Where can we get people that have this mindset, this leadership skill set? Where do we find them?
00:07:22.88 --> 00:07:26.64 And you know, Nathan, I would kind of struggle as well. You can try and hire vets or whatever.
00:07:26.64 --> 00:07:31.44 And then when Mike got on board and, you know, he just said, hey, we can actually do this because
00:07:31.44 --> 00:07:38.000 your background with vetted. And it was, it was just such an obvious answer to help the clients that we
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.44 have at Escalafron be able to get good people. And on top of that, take veterans that are coming
00:07:45.44 --> 00:07:49.36 out that have been institutionalized because I don't know if a better way to describe it because
00:07:49.36 --> 00:07:52.48 I know I was damn sure institutionalized. You know, I spent my entire adult life in the
00:07:52.48 --> 00:07:57.20 sealed teams had no idea. I'll tell people people would be like, you know, when you started
00:07:57.20 --> 00:08:02.24 teaching leadership, like, how did you know it was going to work in the civilian world? I didn't,
00:08:02.24 --> 00:08:05.76 I didn't. The first time I sat down with the CEO and I was talking to them, I had no idea
00:08:05.76 --> 00:08:14.48 that almost never mind, almost that that line for line, the leadership that we talked to seals
00:08:14.48 --> 00:08:20.08 was the exact same leadership that was needed in a company or in a team. And as soon as I realized
00:08:20.08 --> 00:08:24.24 that, I said, we've got something very special here because we had distilled it down and it
00:08:24.24 --> 00:08:29.36 made so much sense and he had been tested. As soon as got out in the civilian sector, same thing.
00:08:29.36 --> 00:08:37.84 So when Mike started saying, hey, we could actually help the military folks and help the civilian
00:08:37.84 --> 00:08:43.04 companies. I mean, this is just a win, win across the board. You know, you've got both sides
00:08:43.04 --> 00:08:48.16 of the equation that absolutely benefit from doing this math and it doesn't get any better than that.
00:08:50.40 --> 00:08:58.32 So to actually now jump into the book a little bit, kicks this off in chapter one,
00:08:58.32 --> 00:09:04.08 you can't see talent. A Navy seal instructor told Dr. Josh Cotton. Tell me about Josh Cotton
00:09:04.08 --> 00:09:10.64 before I think in here. So Josh is our counterpart, help with right the book. Josh and I connected
00:09:10.64 --> 00:09:16.88 through multiple, multiple contacts of Josh's story is interesting. You know, you think Werner
00:09:16.88 --> 00:09:21.92 Josh is the ultimate nerd and I give him a crap for that. He loves data. He's an industrial
00:09:21.92 --> 00:09:27.60 organization on psychologist. Well, when he was finishing his doctorate, he worked with the Navy
00:09:27.60 --> 00:09:32.96 out of Millington and eventually a contract came along where which was offered to him to work with
00:09:32.96 --> 00:09:40.08 the Navy seals to assess how they assess and select talent into their community. So he also worked
00:09:40.08 --> 00:09:45.28 with a little bit with the Mars community, the Arnold Army Special Operations Special Forces Community
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.72 and he gained experience that most doctors, I know, had a close psychologist, don't receive.
00:09:52.72 --> 00:09:56.88 And then he took what he found based off assessing high performers, which arguably,
00:09:56.88 --> 00:10:02.40 to special operations community is a bunch of high performers and how do you apply that to a business
00:10:02.40 --> 00:10:07.52 setting? And it resonated extremely well. So as he stepped out of that contract, he stepped into the
00:10:07.52 --> 00:10:13.52 Fortune 500 right now. You know, he's the director of talent assessments for a major Fortune
00:10:13.52 --> 00:10:21.04 500 company throughout the organization. And so he's, you know, he's looking at all this data
00:10:21.84 --> 00:10:25.76 at performers at different levels of the organization. And that's where he came into the book.
00:10:25.76 --> 00:10:33.36 You know what that reminds me of. So at some point, I was talking to one of the guys that worked
00:10:33.36 --> 00:10:38.88 at Buds as a civilian contractor, as what's the real word for an athletic trainer? Is it just
00:10:38.88 --> 00:10:41.92 called an athletic trainer? Is that what it is? Is that the job, especially someone that
00:10:41.92 --> 00:10:45.36 looks at your spring, Dankel or whatever? Is that what it is? Echo Charles? Trainer? Yeah.
00:10:45.36 --> 00:10:51.12 Trainer? So I was talking to one of those guys and he was talking about
00:10:51.12 --> 00:10:57.44 Patella for moral syndrome. So Patella for moral syndrome is this thing that you can get. And it's
00:10:57.44 --> 00:11:05.20 where you're, you're, you're Patella, somehow, rubs against your, your femur or you're a
00:11:05.20 --> 00:11:11.04 Patella tendon, rubs against your femur and it gets sore and swollen, right? And he said, you know,
00:11:11.04 --> 00:11:15.68 in the civilian world at a football team, at a baseball team, at a college football team, whatever,
00:11:15.68 --> 00:11:23.28 he says, you might see a case of Patella for moral syndrome. You might see three in a season.
00:11:24.24 --> 00:11:33.28 He said, I see seven cases of Patella for moral syndrome, a date at Buds. So what I'm saying is,
00:11:33.28 --> 00:11:37.84 you take this doctor that's used to looking at whatever, the assessment of some
00:11:37.84 --> 00:11:41.04 civilian organization, we're going to assess some candidates and, you know, see what,
00:11:41.04 --> 00:11:44.72 see where they're at and see where that mentally and see where that psychologically and
00:11:44.72 --> 00:11:48.40 you have to wait for months and months to see how they actually perform when do they get put
00:11:48.40 --> 00:11:55.52 under pressure at Buds? It's like, oh, here you go, here's a, here's a 180 people that are
00:11:55.52 --> 00:12:01.36 about to get the biggest mental stress of their life in the next four weeks and you get to look at.
00:12:01.36 --> 00:12:05.12 That's, that's, that's an amazing way to get to get experience. And that's what happened with these
00:12:05.12 --> 00:12:09.20 guys that would, would athletic trainers. And it was a couple different approaches that guys would
00:12:09.20 --> 00:12:15.36 have. Some guys would, they would leave like a pro sports team and and come to Buds and they
00:12:15.36 --> 00:12:20.88 would never want to leave because they were so, so much help or they'd come and get all that
00:12:20.88 --> 00:12:26.80 experience and then they'd go to a team because, you know, after you've seen hundreds of cases of
00:12:26.80 --> 00:12:32.08 Patella for moral syndrome and ITB issues and whatever, all those little injuries that they deal
00:12:32.08 --> 00:12:36.32 with all the time, they show up at a baseball team, they can identify things so much easier than
00:12:36.32 --> 00:12:41.92 anybody else could. And so that's what it sounds like. This, this doctor cotton is. And to take
00:12:41.92 --> 00:12:46.32 it one step further following that experience, he created something completely based off special
00:12:46.32 --> 00:12:51.84 operations and how we classify, you know, high performers, it's called the elite performance
00:12:51.84 --> 00:12:58.56 indicator of the EPI and he developed that personal assessment tool, which is now used by business
00:12:58.56 --> 00:13:04.80 is and what we're going to be using sort of is our indexes, just one of many assessments of our
00:13:04.80 --> 00:13:08.88 candidates for the EFO watch candidates that come to us from the military.
00:13:08.88 --> 00:13:13.04 Bud, yeah. All right. So now that we've got Dr. Josh cotton, we know about him and so I'll
00:13:13.04 --> 00:13:18.80 take it from the top. You can't see talent. A Navy SEAL instructor told Dr. Josh cotton,
00:13:18.80 --> 00:13:23.76 it's not the biggest guy or the strongest or the fastest. You have to trust the process.
00:13:23.76 --> 00:13:28.88 The process will reveal who has the potential to become a SEAL. Dr. Cotton was working with
00:13:28.88 --> 00:13:32.48 the Navy SEAL community to improve their assessment and selection process. To that end,
00:13:32.48 --> 00:13:37.28 he'd been asking all the instructors what do you look for in recruits. He had received a lot of
00:13:37.28 --> 00:13:42.08 insightful answers. People who don't quit, team players who step up and lead, resiliency, people who
00:13:42.08 --> 00:13:47.60 are calm under pressure, problem solvers. This was the first instructor who had taken their question
00:13:47.60 --> 00:13:53.92 literally, but it was a good answer because you can't inherently see talent, not in somebody's physical
00:13:53.92 --> 00:14:00.56 appearance and especially not on their resume. Now we go into this little case study, which is
00:14:00.56 --> 00:14:04.96 interesting about this is people ask me, you know, like who's going to meet you? You think that
00:14:04.96 --> 00:14:12.40 guy is going to make it? I've said, I have no idea because you can't tell. In fact, there was a guy
00:14:12.40 --> 00:14:20.08 who was a captain and a great guy and he had never signed anyone off and said, this guy is going to
00:14:20.08 --> 00:14:27.52 make it and he eventually got this candidate through whatever relationships he had, this candidate
00:14:27.52 --> 00:14:33.28 came out, this guy was like a multi-language really diverse background, seemed like he had a bunch of
00:14:33.28 --> 00:14:40.96 bunch of experience highly educated and he signed off on the guy and this is the one guy he signed off
00:14:40.96 --> 00:14:45.52 of to be an officer in the sealed teams and the guy quit and he said, I'll never sign off and he
00:14:45.52 --> 00:14:49.60 interviewed him. The whole line you had to go to the captain in the sealed teams. Signed off
00:14:49.60 --> 00:14:54.24 on the guy, he quit, he said, I'll never sign off on anyone again. Now let's be honest, just
00:14:54.24 --> 00:14:58.96 and start that way. When it was 25 year old, Jocca, you were like hey, that guy, as you watch all
00:14:58.96 --> 00:15:04.000 of it, but I can't at lines up y'all. He played football in a D1 school, he's going to make it,
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.08 or any of that kid that did speech into debate, he's going to be gone within the first two weeks,
00:15:08.08 --> 00:15:13.12 dude, in fact you say life humbles you, you still be learning, you don't know, you don't even
00:15:13.12 --> 00:15:19.04 have to go to 25 year old, you're Jocca, you can go to 19 years old, as I'm watching guys that were
00:15:19.04 --> 00:15:25.12 infinitely better qualified and you know, athletically more talented than me and I'm watching them
00:15:25.12 --> 00:15:29.12 quit and I was like okay, I guess there's no telling who's going to get through this program
00:15:30.32 --> 00:15:36.08 and speaking of which is the way you get to. Going back to the book, Mike embarrassly learned
00:15:36.08 --> 00:15:40.48 this lesson firsthand when he was a student at going through Naval Special Warfare under water
00:15:40.48 --> 00:15:47.20 demolition seal training, but Mike was a prior-listed recon Marine and by the way I'm talking
00:15:47.20 --> 00:15:51.20 about Mike, Mike's really sitting right here. Mike was a prior-listed recon Marine, one of the
00:15:51.20 --> 00:15:54.72 Marine Corps Special Operation capable forces which later became an official part of the Special
00:15:54.72 --> 00:15:59.84 Operations Community in 2006 and Scouts Kniver in May of 2003, he was discharged as a sergeant
00:15:59.84 --> 00:16:04.88 and commissioned as a Naval Officer and issued immediate orders to buds the Marines at taught him how
00:16:04.88 --> 00:16:09.76 to lead a team and he foolishly and arrogantly believed that his natural, that this naturally led
00:16:09.76 --> 00:16:13.76 to the ability to determine which candidates would make great seals and which candidates didn't
00:16:13.76 --> 00:16:19.28 deserve to be there. His six months in buds would be a brutal lesson in humility on how wrong he
00:16:19.28 --> 00:16:24.56 was and his ideas about evaluating candidates. How could he be in a position to determine who would
00:16:24.56 --> 00:16:29.44 make great special operations soldier when he was competing for the very honor the other students
00:16:29.44 --> 00:16:34.24 we're striving for. In this class Mike made the same class mistake that every business leader or
00:16:34.24 --> 00:16:38.88 HR manager makes when they toss a resume into the trash because the candidate doesn't have the
00:16:38.88 --> 00:16:45.60 exact education or industry experience required. Like most hiring managers today he judged a book
00:16:45.60 --> 00:16:52.72 by its cover that book was Ryan Job. Ryan didn't look like a seal. He was on the heavier side
00:16:52.72 --> 00:16:56.96 for a seal at least and nobody knew how he'd make it through the initial how he'd made it through
00:16:56.96 --> 00:17:01.76 the initial physical standards to even get into buts. Mike looked at Ryan and he made a snap
00:17:01.76 --> 00:17:06.40 judgment. This guy's not going to make it he thought. Mike wasn't the only one who thought so.
00:17:06.40 --> 00:17:10.72 The rest of the class and the seal instructors all thought Ryan didn't fit the mold of the seal.
00:17:11.36 --> 00:17:17.12 Since everybody expected Ryan to quit the instructors decided to speed the process along.
00:17:17.12 --> 00:17:21.60 They threw everything they could at Ryan with within ethical and legal means of course
00:17:23.04 --> 00:17:27.60 interesting note you made there. Of course interesting of course it was within ethical and legal
00:17:27.60 --> 00:17:32.40 means buts is already among the most intensive physical and mental training a person can endure
00:17:32.40 --> 00:17:36.000 and it was even harder for Ryan. The instructors made him run extra miles and do more pushups.
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.28 They forced him to be called let in Sandy longer than the rest of the students. By the end of
00:17:39.28 --> 00:17:44.32 hell week approximately two months in retraining the class had gone from 250 students down to 35.
00:17:44.32 --> 00:17:49.12 Recruit after recruit rang the bell three times signifying a DOR drop on request or
00:17:49.12 --> 00:17:54.88 laments term they quit. Only 35 guys were left and Mike was one of them. He felt he was truly
00:17:55.44 --> 00:18:00.000 part of an elite organization a brotherhood as he looked down the line of the physical
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000 beast standing alongside him. He was astonished. A few candidates to his left stood none other than
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.32 Ryan Job who was smiling. Mike and Ryan both reported to seal team three they eventually
00:18:14.32 --> 00:18:18.48 deployed to Ramadi. I rack where they fought in the battle of Ramadi in 2006 one of the fiercest
00:18:18.48 --> 00:18:22.64 battles in the global war on terror. Ryan performed as an automatic weapons machine gunner during
00:18:22.64 --> 00:18:27.36 the days in Ramadi. After months of fierce fighting Ryan was critically wounded during a major
00:18:27.36 --> 00:18:33.36 operation in South Central Ramadi contested area held by alkai to forces. You shot in the face
00:18:33.36 --> 00:18:38.80 by a sniper while laying down machine gun fire to cover a squad of seals closing on the enemy.
00:18:39.44 --> 00:18:43.20 Days after Ryan was wounded doctors declared he would never recover his sight.
00:18:44.40 --> 00:18:48.80 In salt to injury he also lost his sense of smell and taste but it didn't slow him down.
00:18:49.76 --> 00:18:54.88 After his injury Ryan displayed the same drive and resiliency he demonstrated during his days at
00:18:54.88 --> 00:18:59.60 buds. He refused to quit or feel sorry for himself. Despite all the setbacks he finished his
00:18:59.60 --> 00:19:07.36 bachelor's in business with a 4.0 GPA he ascended the 14,411 feet of Mount Ranier and even shot
00:19:07.36 --> 00:19:13.12 a and killed a trophy bull elk. All this without his sight, smell or taste.
00:19:14.40 --> 00:19:20.24 Ryan underwent countless surgeries and rehabilitation in years after Ramadi. In 2009 only a few
00:19:20.24 --> 00:19:25.76 weeks after he found out he and his wife his high school sweetheart would be having a baby. He
00:19:25.76 --> 00:19:33.68 aspirated and died during his 22nd surgery for his injuries. He became what seals call the last
00:19:33.68 --> 00:19:38.48 fatality of the battle of Ramadi. He was the third seal from his task unit to die.
00:19:40.72 --> 00:19:45.60 Fellow seal Mark Lee was the first and the second Michael Montsourer who was awarded the
00:19:45.60 --> 00:19:50.56 Medal of Honor for jumping on a grenade to save two seals, one of which was Mike Surelli.
00:19:53.68 --> 00:19:59.68 It's hard for Mike to believe now that he ever doubted Ryan. He was always waiting for a time to
00:19:59.68 --> 00:20:04.16 apologize and he found that time while they were in Ramadi. While they were in Ramadi.
00:20:04.16 --> 00:20:14.80 After Mike apologized Ryan said it's okay everyone's been misreading me all my life.
00:20:21.28 --> 00:20:30.000 So I don't know if there's a better example of why we can't judge a book by its cover than Ryan.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.60 He ended up rolling into Charlie Patoon and tasked him to bruise her and he got some personal
00:20:42.64 --> 00:20:50.64 love and encouragement from his Patumates to make sure that he was going to be an awesome seal.
00:20:50.64 --> 00:20:59.92 But this is a metaphor for what you guys see in the civilian sector with people looking at
00:20:59.92 --> 00:21:04.64 resumes and judging books by its cover. Same thing.
00:21:05.20 --> 00:21:11.04 Every day, thousands upon thousands of resumes coming in, managers like,
00:21:11.04 --> 00:21:16.40 this guy's been in our competitor, this person's done ABC, they have all these experience.
00:21:16.40 --> 00:21:21.92 Yeah, got to hire him right away. No process. I just know it. Got call.
00:21:23.44 --> 00:21:30.56 When everyone's talking to companies and I'll, a common question is what, what question should
00:21:30.56 --> 00:21:35.36 you ask during an interview? It's a pretty common question or what assessment or what should we do?
00:21:35.36 --> 00:21:42.24 How should we screen and I'm always saying, hey look, try and put the person in a position
00:21:42.24 --> 00:21:46.96 or a situation that's as similar as they're going to be working in because that's the best way to
00:21:46.96 --> 00:21:50.24 assess if they're going to be able to do it or not. It's a similar thing that they're doing now.
00:21:50.80 --> 00:21:53.52 You know, for years, they're trying to figure out who is going to make it through seal training.
00:21:55.12 --> 00:21:59.84 And now what they do is they send them to what is I think it's Chicago. They send them
00:21:59.84 --> 00:22:07.68 Chicago and they go through a pre-training situation where what they do is basically freaking train
00:22:07.68 --> 00:22:12.88 really, really hard and a bunch of people don't make it through that but then they find that, oh yeah,
00:22:12.88 --> 00:22:17.52 more people that made it through that are going to make it through actual buds. Well, it's like,
00:22:17.52 --> 00:22:22.80 does that not true? I've got to look at the numbers. I don't think it was a substantial increase
00:22:22.80 --> 00:22:26.48 in the number that actually made it through buds. But again, we've got to go back and look at the
00:22:26.48 --> 00:22:31.36 data. But it's the same thing with Dr. Cotton. And we see this with people who build assessments.
00:22:31.36 --> 00:22:36.88 We've even, it's funny you brought up trainers for the screening for Jay Sock. There were physical
00:22:36.88 --> 00:22:44.16 trainers that believed they could give you an 80% sort of answer on whether somebody was going to
00:22:44.16 --> 00:22:47.92 make it through the training or not. Everyone claims, oh well, my personal assessment test will
00:22:47.92 --> 00:22:52.64 give you 80% probability of whether a person will make it through the training. And it's all wrong.
00:22:53.52 --> 00:22:58.72 That's what's the perfect question we need to answer in the interview. We hear that all the time.
00:22:58.72 --> 00:23:03.68 There is no one perfect. There's no one perfect personal assessment. Some people like the
00:23:03.68 --> 00:23:08.16 Hogan, other people like the disc. And what you're not going to find in this book is it's not
00:23:08.16 --> 00:23:13.44 prescriptive. So I can be like, okay, step one. This is what you do. Step two, these are the questions
00:23:13.44 --> 00:23:18.08 that you need to ask. These are the personal assessments that you use. It's different for every company.
00:23:18.08 --> 00:23:24.40 What it is, you've got to identify your process. What's the process that works for you that
00:23:24.40 --> 00:23:33.28 results in statistically the most quality hiders? And that is a, as you know, that is a decade long
00:23:33.28 --> 00:23:38.000 pursuit and it's taking special operations. There's still redo. There's still constantly evolving
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.56 the process. 50 decades and they're still evolving that process. So yeah, you know, we hear it all
00:23:44.56 --> 00:23:48.32 the time and somebody says this is the number one question I asked that determines whether somebody's
00:23:48.32 --> 00:23:53.68 going to work at the company or not. And if that works, we're not here to judge that's great.
00:23:53.68 --> 00:23:58.16 You know, we get people coming to us all the time saying, what are those questions? And I kind of
00:23:58.16 --> 00:24:04.08 kind of off. Like, do you know what success looks like in your company? Yeah. They're already starting
00:24:04.08 --> 00:24:08.56 down the interview path before they've determined what success looks like. What they're even looking
00:24:08.56 --> 00:24:13.44 for. Exactly. What gaps do we have? What are we trying to do here? You know, and you know,
00:24:13.44 --> 00:24:18.48 when I was coaching veterans and you know, Mike and I do this webinar. And I said, can any of you
00:24:18.48 --> 00:24:24.000 tell me a time where you've left the wire and didn't clearly know what success looked like?
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.04 But do you watch people walk into the hiring process all the time? And they're like, okay,
00:24:29.04 --> 00:24:33.76 here's a list of objective requirements. I want them to come from these companies. Okay, let's
00:24:33.76 --> 00:24:39.52 figure out the interview questions. Yeah. Like you have a literally backwards. Yeah. So I guess this
00:24:39.52 --> 00:24:43.68 is going back to what I was originally starting to say that I got sidetracked on. So when I asked
00:24:43.68 --> 00:24:48.48 companies or people asked me, what's the question you ask? I always asked the group a question.
00:24:48.48 --> 00:24:54.96 I'll say, who here has ever hired someone that did the best interview. It was outstanding. You
00:24:54.96 --> 00:24:59.44 thought this guy was a rock star. You bring along board and they're told to disaster. And
00:25:00.16 --> 00:25:04.24 100% of time every single person will raise their hand because everyone has done that. We, this guy
00:25:04.24 --> 00:25:09.28 interviewed great, super-carol. She was terrific in the interview. All charismatic. They do a great job
00:25:09.28 --> 00:25:14.08 in the interview and they're duds when they show up to work. And then I asked the opposing question,
00:25:14.08 --> 00:25:19.76 which is, who here has looked, you needed to fill a sea, you took a risk on somebody. You
00:25:19.76 --> 00:25:24.56 weren't really sure it would work out. They got in there and they crushed it. And the same thing,
00:25:24.56 --> 00:25:32.000 everyone raises their hand. So it's a common problem and it's a common problem that we all have
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.68 where we think we know better than life. Yeah. And I got to tell you, you know, I've been doing
00:25:39.68 --> 00:25:45.84 this 20 plus years and, you know, I worked for Fortune 50 Company one year. My team hired the team
00:25:45.84 --> 00:25:52.88 that I led hired 23,000 people in one year. So I can say from a scale perspective that I probably
00:25:52.88 --> 00:25:59.60 hired the more people than most on the planet. And I promise you, I've got to trust the process.
00:25:59.60 --> 00:26:03.28 There's no part of me that goes, oh yeah, I got that down. I know that person, yeah, they're going to
00:26:03.28 --> 00:26:08.40 rock it. No, no, that process. If you don't have a process and if you haven't defined success,
00:26:08.40 --> 00:26:13.84 hiring will humble you. You know, and you've got to approach it. And you know, one of the things
00:26:13.84 --> 00:26:20.88 that Mike and I went to great lengths about in this book was no process is perfect. And it's,
00:26:20.88 --> 00:26:26.32 you know, and one of the big things where you're talking with Josh was, you know, how do you know
00:26:26.32 --> 00:26:31.36 when you're doing it wrong? How do you get a feedback loop? And people just do hiring is something
00:26:31.36 --> 00:26:35.44 mechanical. And they don't think about this. Oh, we got to go do this. So it's outsourced and
00:26:35.44 --> 00:26:39.28 your HR is just okay, they're turning the cranks. And they're bringing people in the door. They're
00:26:39.28 --> 00:26:45.28 funneling through resumes. Yeah. But even with my years of experience, you know, you know, I'm always
00:26:45.28 --> 00:26:49.76 questioning myself. What am I missing? What have I missing? Did I get this right? Did I evaluate all the
00:26:49.76 --> 00:26:55.52 right traits for success in this role? And you know, I'm still going to miss. And I'll get humbled by it
00:26:55.52 --> 00:27:00.64 real quick. Every time I think I'm confident, Murphy's Law comes around and then humbles me click.
00:27:00.64 --> 00:27:07.28 It's an art. It's an art. There's a science behind it, but ultimately much like you can study war
00:27:08.40 --> 00:27:14.16 in the United States and train for a decade. But until you step into the arena of war,
00:27:14.16 --> 00:27:19.60 you really don't hone that art. And so you're going to make mistakes. If you have a process
00:27:20.64 --> 00:27:26.16 when we see the bad hires happen is when people deviate from that process and they put a time
00:27:26.16 --> 00:27:30.16 women on it. And we're not taking it. We're not telling anyone that you're going to take six months to
00:27:30.16 --> 00:27:34.72 interview somebody to hire for the job. No, we understand that it has to be within reasonable time
00:27:34.72 --> 00:27:39.92 on it. But you know, I know we're probably going to get to this. You can have the greatest,
00:27:41.12 --> 00:27:49.04 world's best talent acquisition process. You can have a great process. But if you don't have
00:27:49.04 --> 00:27:53.60 your leadership foundation, if it's not solid within the organization, you're going to become
00:27:53.60 --> 00:27:58.32 a revolving door for talent. You're going to get great people into the company and once they recognize
00:27:58.32 --> 00:28:02.40 that there's bad leadership, they're going to leave. So funny enough, this book, and you know,
00:28:02.40 --> 00:28:06.48 it's a subset. It's an important part of leadership. You actually have to start with your leadership
00:28:06.48 --> 00:28:11.36 foundation before you even start to build a good hiring process. And that's where a lot of people
00:28:11.36 --> 00:28:15.36 get it wrong. What we're lacking talent, let's just get good talent and good talent will come in.
00:28:15.36 --> 00:28:19.28 And again, if you're working for a bad later, that person's going to leave. What do we always say?
00:28:19.28 --> 00:28:26.16 You select a boss. Not a job. You select a great boss. Yeah. You say something in here too.
00:28:26.16 --> 00:28:31.44 It's the same thing that you're saying. It will get to it later. But if you're hiring good people,
00:28:31.44 --> 00:28:36.48 they don't put up with knuckleheads. They don't want to work for a knucklehead. So if you go on
00:28:36.48 --> 00:28:40.80 you hire someone that's awesome and you're a knucklehead or your leadership is a bunch of knuckleheads,
00:28:40.80 --> 00:28:44.08 they're not going to stay there. That's just the way it works. And the other thing is, you know,
00:28:44.08 --> 00:28:49.76 there's, you're not just like combat, you're not going to eliminate all risk when you make a
00:28:49.76 --> 00:28:54.80 hire. I mean, there's always going to be some level of risk there. But what you can do, if you
00:28:54.80 --> 00:29:00.56 set up the right process is mitigate that risk as much as humanly possible. And then you end up
00:29:00.56 --> 00:29:06.16 in a much better situation. Getting back to the book because damn, apparently we can all get sidetracked
00:29:06.16 --> 00:29:11.36 pretty quick. I guess I can nerd out on talent too, huh? A little bit. You go into this section of
00:29:11.36 --> 00:29:16.24 what is talent. At the most basic level talent equals high potential candidates. The people most
00:29:16.24 --> 00:29:21.84 likely to become high performers. Talent is people like Ryan Job. It is the individual who never
00:29:21.84 --> 00:29:27.36 gives up who performs in high pressure situations and who will win when others say it's impossible.
00:29:27.36 --> 00:29:36.64 Talent drives the team forward and talent wins. And I'm skipping forward, which, by the way,
00:29:36.64 --> 00:29:40.000 if this book, when I read it seems a little bit fragmented, just because I'm not reading the whole
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.44 thing, you have to buy the book to get all the information. But I'm going to skip ahead here.
00:29:45.44 --> 00:29:49.68 Based on our research and interviews, we have identified nine core characteristics that
00:29:49.68 --> 00:29:55.12 mark an individual as having high potential. Drive. The unrelenting need for achievement and
00:29:55.12 --> 00:30:00.40 constant self improvement. Resiliency. The ability to persevere in the face of challenge and
00:30:00.40 --> 00:30:05.60 bounce back from setbacks. Adaptability. The ability to adjust according to the situation,
00:30:05.60 --> 00:30:11.76 learn new things, innovate and try new methods, humility. Self confidence in one's ability while
00:30:11.76 --> 00:30:16.48 understanding that there's always room for improvement and that others experiences and knowledge
00:30:16.48 --> 00:30:23.68 are valuable. Integrity and adherence to not only what is legal, but also what is right.
00:30:24.56 --> 00:30:29.84 Effective intelligence, the ability to apply one's knowledge to real world scenarios,
00:30:29.84 --> 00:30:36.24 team ability. The ability to function as part of a team placing the success of the whole above
00:30:36.24 --> 00:30:43.12 the needs of the self. Curiosity, a desire to explore the unknown and question the status quo
00:30:43.12 --> 00:30:49.28 in pursuit of better, more effective solutions. And the last one is emotional strength, a positive
00:30:49.28 --> 00:30:54.24 attitude, high empathy, and control over one's own emotions, especially in chaotic,
00:30:54.24 --> 00:31:01.04 stressful situations. These traits are heavily emphasized in special operations and explain
00:31:01.04 --> 00:31:06.000 why many veterans go on to accomplish incredible things in the business world after their military
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000 service. For instance, many companies including Johnson and Johnson with Alex Gorski FedEx,
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.84 with Fred Smith, Bridgewater, David McCormick, and 711 Joe Depinto to name a few are run by veterans.
00:31:17.84 --> 00:31:25.04 These nine attributes are foundational to success no matter the industry. So when you say based on
00:31:25.04 --> 00:31:31.12 our research and interviews, is this stuff that Dr. Cotton kind of put forward or where do you
00:31:31.12 --> 00:31:36.000 guys come up with this? So it's combination of what Dr. Cotton sort of his discovery and then we
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.04 also went and we interviewed people that ran the assessment selection for these different communities.
00:31:41.04 --> 00:31:47.68 Mar Sock, the Navy SEALs, the Green Berets. We worked with an amazing individual. His name is Brian Decker.
00:31:47.68 --> 00:31:53.20 He was a lieutenant colonel. He was in charge of the special forces assessment and selection
00:31:53.20 --> 00:31:58.32 process and actually sort of revolutionized it really around the concept of the whole man concept.
00:31:58.32 --> 00:32:04.08 And so each of these communities have a set of core attributes they're looking for. And it
00:32:04.08 --> 00:32:08.64 goes back really quickly. You did make a point about, you know, you hire somebody who interviews
00:32:08.64 --> 00:32:13.52 extremely well and they end up not working out. And that's what we call personality versus
00:32:13.52 --> 00:32:18.000 character. What you did was you hired based off personality and like ability and what is personality.
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.24 That's really your external sort of show to the world where characters the inner
00:32:25.04 --> 00:32:31.76 attributes that drive your behaviors. And we say all fall in for that. It's like your customer facing
00:32:31.76 --> 00:32:37.84 self versus your internal facing self. Exactly. And you know one of the things we we talk about in the
00:32:37.84 --> 00:32:41.60 book is like the last thing you want to hire for. And then people get this, you know, this
00:32:41.60 --> 00:32:46.40 culture fit. Are they a culture fit? And it sort of becomes this just ad hoc term they throw out
00:32:46.40 --> 00:32:52.000 but they don't really understand. And when people say culture fit, a lot of times what they mean is
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.28 do I like this person. And what we talk about in the book is that some of the the most high
00:32:57.28 --> 00:33:02.56 performing seals that I served with and you served with. I didn't like weird professionals and
00:33:02.56 --> 00:33:06.64 worked well together. But when the job was done he went and hung out with his inner circle and I
00:33:06.64 --> 00:33:12.24 went and hung with mine. But like ability for professionals is not a requirement. Now if you
00:33:12.24 --> 00:33:16.96 guys just conflict and it creates a toxic culture that's a different thing but the least important
00:33:16.96 --> 00:33:22.32 thing to me was like ability. If the individual performs and he can actually put his self needs
00:33:22.32 --> 00:33:27.28 a side or her self needs a side for the common good of the team that's somebody that can be part of
00:33:27.28 --> 00:33:35.84 the culture. As long as their values align with our culture. They're ethical. Yeah, I mean I think
00:33:35.84 --> 00:33:42.64 here's the deal on that from my perspective. If there's someone that works hard and is there to
00:33:42.64 --> 00:33:51.28 support the team, I like them. You know they like I don't know anyone that has here's the
00:33:51.28 --> 00:33:58.56 interesting. I know people that have good personalities and bad character they exist but I don't
00:33:58.56 --> 00:34:02.56 know of anyone. And so I might not like someone that has a good personality but you know and you
00:34:02.56 --> 00:34:07.12 can think when I think of these people I just think of famous people. There's all these famous people
00:34:07.12 --> 00:34:11.28 that they have these personalities and then they then all of a sudden the story breaks that they're
00:34:11.28 --> 00:34:17.84 told their backs. And whatever they've got to most heinous things going on in their personal lives.
00:34:17.84 --> 00:34:22.000 So you've got that where someone has a good personality they're they're forward facing
00:34:22.88 --> 00:34:26.000 personalities who are positive but then behind closed doors they're scumbags.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.60 And but if you flip that over I can't think of anybody that has a good character that they're
00:34:33.60 --> 00:34:40.08 a good character but they're a bad but they have a bad personality. I don't it's hard for me to think
00:34:40.08 --> 00:34:46.56 about. Now is there someone that maybe has a has a good character and there there maybe
00:34:46.56 --> 00:34:51.92 two director or maybe they're maybe they don't talk a lot or you know whatever but but normally
00:34:51.92 --> 00:34:54.80 if they've got a if they're he goes and check and they're they're gonna support the team.
00:34:54.80 --> 00:35:03.76 I mean I can't. Yeah it's pretty rare. Yeah but a better way but is there were people that were
00:35:03.76 --> 00:35:09.28 high performers that were just sort of socially awkward. So maybe they were just like they were too
00:35:09.28 --> 00:35:14.56 direct. Right. It burned sometimes bridges you understood their personality but other people didn't.
00:35:15.28 --> 00:35:20.48 Back to the attributes so Brian Decker is now the director of player development for the
00:35:20.48 --> 00:35:25.92 Indianapolis cults and so took what he learned in special forces assessment selection he's now
00:35:25.92 --> 00:35:29.28 applying it he's been in the NFL he's worked for for two teams for about six years.
00:35:30.32 --> 00:35:36.08 When they revolutionized and you know it pains me to say this but I can put my ego aside.
00:35:36.64 --> 00:35:43.04 The special forces army special forces community was much further ahead in terms of creating a
00:35:43.76 --> 00:35:49.84 structured and professionalized assessment of how they select special forces soldiers into the
00:35:49.84 --> 00:35:55.92 community. Seals it was just sort of this oral history passed down and when I went over there
00:35:55.92 --> 00:35:59.92 as a guest instructor at their phase two which is their small unit training that's when I was
00:35:59.92 --> 00:36:04.72 really exposed to their whole process and this thing called the whole man concept and the fact
00:36:04.72 --> 00:36:09.52 that they were looking for specific attributes. So when they redesigned their their assessment
00:36:09.52 --> 00:36:16.24 selection they created tasks much like an interview process where they're trying to elicit
00:36:16.24 --> 00:36:21.84 certain behaviors whether good or bad and that's what they're looking for. And so that translates
00:36:21.84 --> 00:36:26.96 to companies it doesn't matter you know what your interview process is or if you have written
00:36:26.96 --> 00:36:32.64 tests what you're trying to elicit with every every question should have meaning behind it
00:36:32.64 --> 00:36:38.56 in an interview process and ultimately that question has to drive at behaviors that's
00:36:38.56 --> 00:36:42.96 and people call this you know in the civilian world behavioral interviews. They're one of the best
00:36:42.96 --> 00:36:50.32 techniques if you do it well. Yeah the the German Army. Yeah as they were trying to get their
00:36:51.20 --> 00:36:58.24 their officers to step up and implement decentralized command and be able to make moves.
00:36:58.24 --> 00:37:02.40 One of the things that I've read about they would do is they would give them here's the rules
00:37:02.40 --> 00:37:07.92 that you have to follow for this training operation and the only way that they could actually
00:37:07.92 --> 00:37:13.44 successfully complete the mission would be to break the rules. And so it was a test to see if they
00:37:13.44 --> 00:37:18.24 would break the rules in order to accomplish the mission. And then there was and look even if
00:37:18.24 --> 00:37:23.76 if you didn't break the rules it didn't necessarily mean that you were a bad person. It just
00:37:23.76 --> 00:37:29.52 would now we know more about you right now I know more about you and we got into some of this on
00:37:29.52 --> 00:37:36.96 when it up at Gettysburg for you have battlefield. You know the fact that Lee didn't know his
00:37:36.96 --> 00:37:43.28 his two subordinates as well as he had before Jackson died. So he's talking to you all and he's
00:37:43.28 --> 00:37:47.12 telling you all that he wants to do something but he's not knowing well he doesn't know his personality
00:37:47.12 --> 00:37:52.32 well enough. So when he tells you hey take that thing if you can't take that hill if you can and
00:37:52.32 --> 00:37:56.88 you'll go to the other and says well I can't. He code of it just wouldn't have been a gut check.
00:37:56.88 --> 00:38:02.96 And if you would have told Jackson to take that hill Jackson would have taken that hill. So these
00:38:02.96 --> 00:38:09.36 are this idea behind setting up questions or situations or problems that you have to solve that
00:38:09.36 --> 00:38:16.16 reveal some part of your character is a very cool thing. You know when you mentioned earlier about
00:38:16.16 --> 00:38:21.92 when people come to you and ask what's the best interview question the question back to them is
00:38:21.92 --> 00:38:25.76 how are you screening for character. And it's one of the things we go into this book is that
00:38:25.76 --> 00:38:33.76 most of those questions are about experience. Do you have this objective experience? They're not
00:38:33.76 --> 00:38:38.88 screening for character. And so you know with the research that we did with Dr. Justin Cotton brought
00:38:38.88 --> 00:38:45.20 to us and when we figured these out you know our point is is that you know once you meet that simple
00:38:45.20 --> 00:38:50.80 experiential gate when you've got the basics you need to start screening for character and you go
00:38:50.80 --> 00:38:57.44 company by company by company and and I and I hate in some ways to say this because I see it all the time
00:38:57.44 --> 00:39:03.36 which is executives are almost the worst of this picking other executives and they don't screen
00:39:03.36 --> 00:39:08.24 for character they're looking for it. Did you work at the competition? How did you move the revenue?
00:39:08.24 --> 00:39:13.60 How did you improve customer success? How did you move a product along? They don't go down into
00:39:13.60 --> 00:39:18.72 character and I sat in the interview after interview after interview and it and it's all objective
00:39:18.72 --> 00:39:25.04 traits or you know basic subjective traits that don't go deep into character and that's what's missing.
00:39:28.48 --> 00:39:35.28 People will default to objective things because they're measurable. They're easy. It's the easy
00:39:35.28 --> 00:39:41.28 button. The subjective is what's hard. He talked about defining success. You know one of the
00:39:41.28 --> 00:39:45.76 mistakes we see with company students they just have one interview process across the organization.
00:39:45.76 --> 00:39:52.48 You actually have to create talent profiles for each of the roles and functions in levels of
00:39:52.48 --> 00:39:57.20 and that's why it takes a lot of time. So what's going to make a great engineer in a company
00:39:58.08 --> 00:40:02.64 is vastly different from what makes a great salesperson. So a lot of the times
00:40:02.64 --> 00:40:06.80 why companies don't define success and they're not good at the interview process is they haven't
00:40:06.80 --> 00:40:11.44 take the time to create talent profiles for the different levels and the different functions
00:40:11.44 --> 00:40:17.36 within the community. It's much like a seal. The attributes that make a great seal are vastly different
00:40:17.36 --> 00:40:24.08 than the attributes for special operations direct support in Intel officer or someone handling the logistics.
00:40:24.08 --> 00:40:28.000 And we've gotten smarter about that over the years as well. And what a lot of people don't understand
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.04 is we're not only screening the green berets and the Navy seals or also screening the people
00:40:33.60 --> 00:40:37.36 that provide the support to those organizations that ultimately come under our umbrella. They're
00:40:37.36 --> 00:40:42.96 being screened for specific attributes as well. Think about the attributes of a good point man versus
00:40:42.96 --> 00:40:48.96 a good breacher. Right? This is like two guys in the same food but you know that breacher attitude
00:40:48.96 --> 00:40:53.20 versus a point man attitude. That's even those guys are a little bit different and they kind of
00:40:53.20 --> 00:40:58.08 get picked when you show up at the team. You know some little guy that's sneaky point man.
00:40:58.08 --> 00:41:05.52 Some big freaking bruiser walking around breacher. So let me throw this out. You often see that
00:41:05.52 --> 00:41:12.56 bachelor's degree is a requirement and a lot of companies can articulate that. Yeah why?
00:41:12.56 --> 00:41:17.76 Why is that even a requirement? In a not saying it you know it does show somebody took the
00:41:18.96 --> 00:41:22.96 the initiative to go complete their bachelor's degree or a master's and I understand that but
00:41:23.84 --> 00:41:29.44 he's got a great story about when C++ programming came along and I'll let him tell it
00:41:29.44 --> 00:41:36.72 but yeah just embarrassing for the people that were requesting a coder. Yeah I had it. It was
00:41:36.72 --> 00:41:41.68 actually Python was the language that they were coding in and I had a senior engineer come to
00:41:41.68 --> 00:41:45.12 me and say hey George you gotta go find me somebody with five years of Python experience.
00:41:47.28 --> 00:41:51.20 I'm like whoa we can't do that. He's like well why not?
00:41:51.92 --> 00:41:56.000 He said it's only been around three years and you might have not knocked that requirement back
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:04.96 down to three but it's scary that he was so wired to getting an objective level of experience that
00:42:04.96 --> 00:42:10.72 he didn't relate to the job and was completely arbitrary and wasn't timed any measure of success.
00:42:11.44 --> 00:42:16.08 So I mean we calibrated him really quickly we got somebody that had spent most of their you know
00:42:16.80 --> 00:42:23.20 the last few years doing Python you know coding but you know working with that language but it
00:42:23.20 --> 00:42:28.88 was shocking that it came from an engineer. Yeah you gotta watch out for that one.
00:42:31.20 --> 00:42:36.40 Going back to the book the importance of a talent mindset and this is this is sort of a thread
00:42:36.40 --> 00:42:41.60 that goes throughout the book. A talent mindset is the deep belief that human capital is the single
00:42:41.60 --> 00:42:46.56 most important competitive advantage your company can have. When a company has talent mindset
00:42:46.56 --> 00:42:54.000 assessing, selecting and developing the best talent is a top priority. A talent mindset not only
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.40 accounts for hiring talented people but also includes the continual development and investment
00:43:00.40 --> 00:43:07.76 in that talent through their tenure in the organization. So beyond just bringing people on board it's
00:43:09.20 --> 00:43:15.52 continuing to grow them and make them better. So we call the high potential. When you're going through
00:43:15.52 --> 00:43:19.84 the interview process to select new seals in when they graduate buds are they had performers?
00:43:21.04 --> 00:43:25.44 They're not yet. They haven't been proven. They they passed the first gate. That gate is closed.
00:43:26.08 --> 00:43:31.76 They are high potentials. So even if you're looking for a frontline trooper frontline employee or a
00:43:31.76 --> 00:43:35.04 brand new CEO when you bring them into the organization. If you made that decision that they're going
00:43:35.04 --> 00:43:40.32 to be part of the team even if that he's been a prior CEO in another company he's a high potential
00:43:40.32 --> 00:43:44.48 within that new organization. He's not proven yet. So in order to turn that person from a high
00:43:44.48 --> 00:43:47.92 potential I mean this this is what we do for a living in national unfrient. Now you have to
00:43:47.92 --> 00:43:52.56 develop them and that takes a lot of time and effort and it never stops. And if you want to turn
00:43:52.56 --> 00:43:57.68 that high potential into a high performer it's again it's you have to pour in and invest in those
00:43:57.68 --> 00:44:03.60 people and that's why special operations was sort of the the foundational organization we focused
00:44:03.60 --> 00:44:08.56 on in this book because they do it so well. At the core of what you know makes special operations
00:44:08.56 --> 00:44:13.36 so special it's their fundamental belief that people are everything and of course when we say
00:44:13.36 --> 00:44:17.60 people you're also talking about leadership. And then you know you look it's one of the things we
00:44:17.60 --> 00:44:23.84 drive through in the book that Talon mindset is that everything changes so rapidly today. Technology
00:44:23.84 --> 00:44:30.80 the economy markets companies you're only true competitive advantage is talent and that's what we're
00:44:30.80 --> 00:44:37.60 trying to convey is that it isn't the hardware in special operations it's the people and and that's
00:44:37.60 --> 00:44:43.92 how it's got to be in corporate America and it's got to be where you treat your human capital with
00:44:43.92 --> 00:44:49.52 the same rigor and the same focus that you treat your financial capital. And time and again Mike
00:44:49.52 --> 00:44:54.16 and I see that you know of course revenue, here's all people are focused on revenue they're not
00:44:54.16 --> 00:45:03.92 focused on the human capital which is driving everything. You get into this section chapter two what's
00:45:03.92 --> 00:45:09.76 so wrong with traditional hiring practices. George Feld has if you'd want a lottery for a career
00:45:10.48 --> 00:45:14.72 through a highly selective veteran hiring group you just been offered a position at one of the
00:45:14.72 --> 00:45:20.08 world's largest big box retailers according to the company representative they were looking for
00:45:20.08 --> 00:45:25.76 driven leaders who know new how to mentor lead and provide vision for people. Sounded like the
00:45:25.76 --> 00:45:30.88 perfect fit for George plus the job included good salary stock options and growth opportunity.
00:45:30.88 --> 00:45:35.52 It was George's first civilian job after nearly a decade of active duty service and we'd
00:45:35.52 --> 00:45:40.56 set him up to be able to go anywhere and do anything. George accepted the job his very first day of
00:45:40.56 --> 00:45:46.72 orientation training and onboarding was like a punch in the gut. Nothing was about talent or
00:45:46.72 --> 00:45:50.40 leadership. The position was none of the things they'd advertised or told him they didn't want
00:45:50.40 --> 00:45:54.000 a leader they wanted someone who'd fill vacant positions as quickly as possible with people who
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.52 did hear strictly to the rules they were looking for cogs and a machine not talent. Accordingly
00:45:59.52 --> 00:46:03.84 their recruiting teams were evaluated based on efficiency their speed of filling vacant roles and
00:46:03.84 --> 00:46:08.72 cost per hire. To say it was a bad fit was a gross understatement nevertheless George soon proved
00:46:08.72 --> 00:46:14.80 himself to be a high performer and was promoted. His new role still wasn't a good fit fit so we applied
00:46:14.80 --> 00:46:19.76 for another position within the company he felt he would be more suitable. Despite exceeding all
00:46:19.76 --> 00:46:24.88 this key performance indicators and being ranked in the top 5% of his divisional employees the company
00:46:24.88 --> 00:46:29.28 refused to move him. He was succeeding in a leadership role that others struggled with so the
00:46:29.28 --> 00:46:35.04 company wanted to keep him there. George made it 20 months before he quit. He wasn't the only one who
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:40.96 had to leave quickly. Several peers who shared his talent mindset let also left within two years.
00:46:40.96 --> 00:46:45.28 George and his peers had been able to transform and improve their small assigned corners of the
00:46:45.28 --> 00:46:49.44 company but as soon as they left everything reverted back to the status quo. A tradition went up
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.04 and all the KPIs went unmet. George learned a lot of valuable lessons from that big box retailer
00:46:55.04 --> 00:46:59.92 primarily in what not to do which can be as important to knowing what to do. There was a first hand
00:46:59.92 --> 00:47:05.20 look at how broken traditional talent acquisition is. The mistakes this organization made are the
00:47:05.20 --> 00:47:10.64 same ones we see companies make again and again. And here they are lacking a talent mindset not
00:47:10.64 --> 00:47:15.28 understanding how HR should be structured to drive impact, having a butts and seats mentality,
00:47:15.28 --> 00:47:21.52 participating in fear-based hiring and settling for mediocrity. Anyone of these mistakes
00:47:21.52 --> 00:47:26.96 and spelled disaster foreign organization but the most destructive mistake is missing the talent mindset.
00:47:28.88 --> 00:47:33.60 Rough first tour out of the military huh? It was. It was and you know I've got a four-year
00:47:33.60 --> 00:47:38.80 old my wife's pregnant when I'm thinking okay I've had a great career. The things that made me
00:47:38.80 --> 00:47:42.48 successful in the military they're going to make me successful in the corporate world and I'm just
00:47:42.48 --> 00:47:48.48 fired up. You know young don't know what I don't know and use one of those veteran firms and
00:47:48.48 --> 00:47:58.08 oh I landed job. You know what I think is interesting about that is I bet that many people here
00:47:58.08 --> 00:48:04.72 oh you've got a guy that's been in the military for 10 years. What he wants and what he expects
00:48:05.92 --> 00:48:09.20 this is someone that doesn't it hasn't been in the military what he wants and what he expects is
00:48:10.24 --> 00:48:16.16 to be told what to do and then follow the protocol as has been as you're told and staying your box
00:48:16.16 --> 00:48:21.92 and anyone that's in the bend in the military knows that that's not how the military operates
00:48:21.92 --> 00:48:25.60 at least that's not how it should operate. So you go into that position they think oh cool we've got a
00:48:25.60 --> 00:48:33.28 cog here that we can just count on to you know run the numbers whatever follow the daily program
00:48:33.76 --> 00:48:38.48 when in reality what does a military individual want to do wants to improve things wants to make
00:48:38.48 --> 00:48:42.56 things better wants to grow wants to get more efficient wants to want to push and improve that's what we
00:48:42.56 --> 00:48:47.76 want to do and all of a sudden you're trapped in a situation where no don't do that. Oh yeah I was
00:48:48.48 --> 00:48:56.000 sitting there and you walk in the first day and I'm like what happened what did I miss how did I
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.04 miss this you the other thing they wanted rule followers you know this is a big box retail or
00:49:01.04 --> 00:49:05.36 we won't we go to great likes we do not name any of these companies but I walk in the door
00:49:05.36 --> 00:49:10.88 everybody would know this one and they're expecting me to execute very specific rules I mean
00:49:10.88 --> 00:49:16.96 it they had a more manuals for the same task than the United States Army does it was it was
00:49:16.96 --> 00:49:21.44 phenomenal and that's impressive that's very impressive how you pull that off you want to know how to
00:49:21.44 --> 00:49:26.40 do something there's a there's a binder up there and you know this is this is before everything
00:49:26.40 --> 00:49:32.72 you know on on your iPads and on your computer and they wanted rule followers and immediately
00:49:32.72 --> 00:49:36.96 I knew that was wrong because to your point the one thing that I would add is you know military
00:49:36.96 --> 00:49:43.04 people come out want to win they want to make a difference they want to make an impact and so when
00:49:43.04 --> 00:49:49.44 you're looking at a company and you know you see this this big name and I got to be honest another
00:49:49.44 --> 00:49:54.72 way I got humbled was those stock options looked really really good when I came out I'm like
00:49:54.72 --> 00:50:00.08 who I've got equity I got something I would never get otherwise but they want to rule followers and
00:50:00.08 --> 00:50:05.84 and so there was no there were no latitude you know when I work my commanders you know everybody
00:50:05.84 --> 00:50:11.60 I work with they give me my left and right limits but they also entrust me to make good solid
00:50:11.60 --> 00:50:16.000 decisions that take care by people if I need to exceed that left and right limit and I communicate
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.40 those things but I got here and it's literally you're in a really really small box and you you go
00:50:22.40 --> 00:50:28.64 from thinking that you're going to be wildly successful and to be honest with you I was because I don't
00:50:28.64 --> 00:50:33.12 care what you're going to throw at me I'm going to figure it out and and and I did but it was just
00:50:33.12 --> 00:50:37.84 missing so many things and veterans crave being able to make you were just making a difference
00:50:37.84 --> 00:50:42.48 of the service now you want to make a difference in the corporate world and you know I was kind
00:50:42.48 --> 00:50:47.44 of almost ashamed to come back tell my wife honey I think I made a mistake you know when she's
00:50:47.44 --> 00:50:52.000 even it's pregnant that was not coming out of my mouth you know I was just like okay I got to
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.64 figure this stuff out but yeah bad fit yeah and just to make sure I clarify this point
00:50:56.64 --> 00:51:04.56 to say that military people we're not saying that military people are not rule followers
00:51:04.56 --> 00:51:09.52 correct and look in the military you follow all kinds of rules from the way you cut your hair
00:51:09.52 --> 00:51:15.28 to the way you've freaking wear your clothing like you follow rules but there's there's another
00:51:15.28 --> 00:51:20.24 level of this and as a leader the last thing I look I as a leader I wanted people that followed
00:51:20.24 --> 00:51:26.16 rules and here's the key point as long as the rules made sense and the rules didn't make sense
00:51:26.16 --> 00:51:30.40 I wanted my guys to come to me and say hey you know what jockel this thing that we're supposed to be
00:51:30.40 --> 00:51:34.88 doing it doesn't make any sense and here's why I don't want people that blindly follow rules that
00:51:34.88 --> 00:51:38.96 don't make sense if there's rules in place there's a good reason for them absolutely military guys are
00:51:38.96 --> 00:51:45.20 great military guys and men and women are great at taking a protocol and exercising that
00:51:45.20 --> 00:51:51.28 protocol and we have the discipline to and the mindset to get that done but what's even more important
00:51:51.28 --> 00:51:57.68 than that is having the mind to look at a problem look at a situation look at a protocol and say
00:51:57.68 --> 00:52:03.84 wait a second we can make this better we can do this more efficiently that's what that's not only
00:52:03.84 --> 00:52:08.88 what we do but it's what we want to do do what drives us because like you said we want to win
00:52:09.60 --> 00:52:15.28 yeah and you want to and you know and and and Mike and I try to do this with each other and you
00:52:15.28 --> 00:52:20.08 want to empower the people that work for you that you're leading to do the very same thing
00:52:20.08 --> 00:52:24.56 to say hey you've got a good idea and I brought a phrase from the two of you the best idea
00:52:24.56 --> 00:52:29.36 wins you come up with an idea it makes sense you know it's not illegal it's not a moral it's not
00:52:29.36 --> 00:52:33.68 an ethical and it's going to drive revenue or improve something hey let's get after let's go do it
00:52:34.24 --> 00:52:40.64 I came up with an idea that I figured out in one year would do two million dollars in operating
00:52:40.64 --> 00:52:49.20 cost reduction and the answer was is it in the book like well no and neither is the two million
00:52:49.20 --> 00:52:55.44 dollars by the way and it was still no and and you know that's kind of the environment where
00:52:55.44 --> 00:52:59.76 military leader goes okay I'm not going to reach my potential here I'm not going to be able to do
00:52:59.76 --> 00:53:04.24 all the things that I want to do and and you know it was challenged because you know I don't want to
00:53:04.24 --> 00:53:09.60 quit anything but you sometimes have to make those hard decisions in your career to say yeah
00:53:09.60 --> 00:53:16.96 I could impact better somewhere else and I did this supports something that I tell people all the time
00:53:16.96 --> 00:53:24.56 that the most important compensation you can give a human being is freedom and autonomy and
00:53:24.56 --> 00:53:28.56 and what that means is ownership ownership over your own destiny and if people like that's a
00:53:28.56 --> 00:53:33.84 classic example here you were you're getting good money you had good stock options you're crushing
00:53:33.84 --> 00:53:42.16 the job which means it's not like it's a tax on your mental power but none of that was compare another
00:53:42.16 --> 00:53:46.56 that none of that was had enough value to make you stay there exactly whereas if you were to had
00:53:46.56 --> 00:53:52.56 autonomy and freedom and the ability to control your own fate and destiny you'd still be there
00:53:52.56 --> 00:53:56.88 right now we wouldn't be having this conversation you'd be running the company yeah exactly
00:53:56.88 --> 00:54:03.52 and you know it's spot on and I came into a company two years ago and then I concertally
00:54:03.52 --> 00:54:10.000 named the company force point which is a room by Raytheon but a cybersecurity company and
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.20 that's what the CEO and the CHRO gave me at that company and what's interesting is we put an
00:54:17.20 --> 00:54:22.000 ethos a marker in the ground for the entire team it was teamwork ownership humility
00:54:23.04 --> 00:54:27.20 turned around the entire I mean we walked into a dumpster fire frankly so when we walked into
00:54:27.92 --> 00:54:32.88 and we were able to do great things but that that value in that ownership that they gave me
00:54:32.88 --> 00:54:37.84 that I was able to give everybody on my team it's everything and so when you come into this
00:54:37.84 --> 00:54:43.92 moment's reconciliation becomes an issue that value that empowerment that ownership you give
00:54:43.92 --> 00:54:51.44 people they stick and in two years we had zero percent attrition wow is that you know what's
00:54:51.44 --> 00:54:57.92 amazing though is that that's a surprise to people and you know I'm kind of sitting back going how can
00:54:57.92 --> 00:55:06.64 that be so so much of a surprise that giving somebody ownership and trust and value is everything
00:55:06.64 --> 00:55:11.12 the most important thing the best form of compensation and the reason I've been able to tell
00:55:11.12 --> 00:55:16.48 that to clients at Ashland front is I say look I had people that you knew in the Sealteams
00:55:16.48 --> 00:55:22.96 in the military in the Navy if you're doing the best job you know three times better than anyone
00:55:22.96 --> 00:55:29.92 else in your opportunity I can't give you a raise okay like I can give you a good evaluation and then
00:55:29.92 --> 00:55:37.20 in two years you'll be eligible for promotion and then you'll get an extra $270 a month no one's
00:55:37.20 --> 00:55:43.12 doing three acts to work because of that but what can you give someone freedom and if you worked
00:55:43.12 --> 00:55:48.88 for me and you were square away you pretty much did whatever you wanted to do and then and I would just
00:55:48.88 --> 00:55:52.96 do nothing but provide cover fire for you if you weren't square away is a totally different
00:55:52.96 --> 00:55:55.84 ballgame you're going to put in a box and you weren't going to be able to maneuver at all because
00:55:55.84 --> 00:56:03.04 you're doing things wrong so the best way to retain your talent is great leadership and it goes
00:56:03.04 --> 00:56:07.68 back to bufre we just did he have battlefield the guysburg you know he operated within the spirit
00:56:08.32 --> 00:56:13.92 of the commanders intent and actually deviated from what was the plan because he saw an opportunity
00:56:13.92 --> 00:56:18.96 I think what the Marine Corps calls it took authority on demand and made calls that ultimately made the
00:56:18.96 --> 00:56:25.60 union army you know victorious over the the Confederates you know you did say something about
00:56:25.60 --> 00:56:31.36 and we deal with this with you have a watch is for some companies it's a mental leap
00:56:32.08 --> 00:56:37.36 to hire a military leader into a senior management role when they're coming fresh out of the military
00:56:38.16 --> 00:56:44.000 and it's usually because of those perceptions are shaped by what the movies
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.84 100% the water you guys I mean you follow orders that it's 100% the cogs in the wheel
00:56:50.48 --> 00:56:56.96 is shaped by movies and we literally have that conversation you know especially during COVID
00:56:58.40 --> 00:57:03.12 we've seen that a lot of organizations did not select the right leaders coming in the
00:57:03.12 --> 00:57:08.40 organization that were not able to innovate in the depth that were not able to handle the chaos
00:57:08.40 --> 00:57:15.76 could not remain calm and we're unable or ill-equipped for crisis and what we have to educate
00:57:15.76 --> 00:57:23.28 them about these men and women coming out is you know one they are generalists but generalists are
00:57:23.28 --> 00:57:31.84 much more powerful than specialists in fact one of the quotes from Brian Decker in this is that
00:57:31.84 --> 00:57:36.80 we've over specialized some of the roles in the private sector it's no longer good enough that
00:57:36.80 --> 00:57:43.28 you're an ear doctor you now have to be a left ear doctor and you know while I understand that
00:57:43.28 --> 00:57:47.12 that is requirement for certain roles if it's a very technical position yes technical skills are
00:57:47.12 --> 00:57:52.48 required but in general management roles which are usually your top leadership roles in a company
00:57:53.12 --> 00:58:01.04 generalists are more equipped to lead and this is why because they they draw from a broader base
00:58:01.04 --> 00:58:05.36 of experiences I mean you've been all run around the world in the military you've dealt with
00:58:05.36 --> 00:58:10.88 different cultures you've dealt with different problems such you have this vast array of experiences
00:58:10.88 --> 00:58:14.72 where a lot of the the business leaders that have never left the United States do not
00:58:15.44 --> 00:58:22.96 and we're finding that that that that experience has not only prepared them but it's the
00:58:22.96 --> 00:58:26.32 fact that there are a lot of these military that are stepping into the roles the ones we place
00:58:26.32 --> 00:58:30.88 are being highly successful they're performing when they step in of course there's a learning curve
00:58:30.88 --> 00:58:36.16 but the learning agility for the the men and women that we place is extremely high that's one of the
00:58:36.16 --> 00:58:42.24 things we're screening for Eddie if I've watched is that yeah into intellectual horsepower matters
00:58:42.24 --> 00:58:49.44 it does but once that gates closed these people are placed and it's it's been phenomenal I mean
00:58:49.44 --> 00:58:53.12 you met something the the clients at the eF battlefield they're like the best higher ever
00:58:53.68 --> 00:58:58.80 yeah the the train ability you know if you've been in the military you know how to learn
00:58:58.80 --> 00:59:03.44 you start learning stuff out of the gate and you learn how to learn very well and so that's why
00:59:03.44 --> 00:59:07.84 when someone comes without the skill set in the civilian sector they can learn that skill set very
00:59:07.84 --> 00:59:13.12 quickly because they've been learning all these different skill sets for eight years 12 years 20
00:59:13.12 --> 00:59:19.84 years 25 years that's what we do in the military it's a new stuff all the time going here section
00:59:19.84 --> 00:59:25.84 called the cost of talent when companies lack a talent mindset it's a common refrain cost creating
00:59:25.84 --> 00:59:30.32 a robust talent acquisition and management process is simply too costly they say what most
00:59:30.32 --> 00:59:36.40 companies don't understand is the major cost is not money but time and devotion to creating a
00:59:36.40 --> 00:59:42.72 world class talent acquisition pipeline in the process you will actually save money in the long run
00:59:42.72 --> 00:59:47.52 as your tuition lowers and you consistently make better hires the special operations community
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:53.20 has long understood that people are everything special operations soldiers go through three main stages
00:59:53.20 --> 00:59:59.92 assessment and selection training and combat and war and then you guys break this out so in special
00:59:59.92 --> 01:00:04.32 operations it's called assessment and selection in business it's called talent acquisition
01:00:04.32 --> 01:00:09.04 or the hiring process and special operations it's called training in business it's called talent
01:00:09.04 --> 01:00:14.000 management and leadership development and then in special operations called combat and war
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.52 and in business it's called business sales marketing production whatever is that you're doing it's a
01:00:19.52 --> 01:00:27.36 pretty good little break out there of how similar these things really are going in another section
01:00:27.36 --> 01:00:33.12 here may companies have a fundamental misalignment between upper leadership and HR where leadership says
01:00:33.12 --> 01:00:40.24 they want talent but HR is not set up to actually hire for talent in fact HR often doesn't even
01:00:40.24 --> 01:00:45.20 know what talent looks like in the company there's no gold standard of talent instead hiring
01:00:45.20 --> 01:00:50.88 is mechanical order taking process based on objective requirements leadership gives HR a laundry list of
01:00:50.88 --> 01:00:56.96 what they want years of experience required skill set compensation range and HR goes out and fills the
01:00:56.96 --> 01:01:03.76 order to have effective talent acquisition your business leaders and HR department must be strategic
01:01:03.76 --> 01:01:09.28 partners the talent acquisition team must be students of the business understanding the organizations
01:01:09.28 --> 01:01:16.40 underlying goals and talent needed to achieve them since day one in my career Joe DePento told us
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:23.60 and that's the CEO of 711 I've always had my CHRO linked at the hip and will continue to
01:01:24.16 --> 01:01:30.24 as Joe is discovered to function strategically your HR department must be a part of the planning
01:01:30.24 --> 01:01:36.40 process for both talent acquisition and management HR should be involved in succession planning
01:01:36.40 --> 01:01:44.08 and gap analysis to assess select and develop talent in a strategic way you know we
01:01:44.08 --> 01:01:53.36 we found this you know I kind of knew it intuitively and I suspected it but when we did the research
01:01:53.36 --> 01:02:02.32 chief human resource officers are often paid one third of their C-suite counterparts that's where it
01:02:02.32 --> 01:02:09.60 starts could you imagine for a second that your your mechanics and your medics were paid a third
01:02:10.16 --> 01:02:14.32 of what you make because they're not frontline could you imagine what that would look like in
01:02:14.32 --> 01:02:23.04 special operations in any military unit and that's where it starts and and HR is not a strategic
01:02:23.04 --> 01:02:28.80 function and you know I had the benefit of coming up with this mentor and somebody who really
01:02:28.80 --> 01:02:36.08 empowered me in her name is Tracy Kio and she is the CHRO of Heal of Packard and she's just absolutely
01:02:36.08 --> 01:02:40.88 amazing you know we put this quote in the book because to this day it's still it's one of the reasons
01:02:40.88 --> 01:02:47.76 that I've stated my function for so long and she went to an executive meeting one day and they're like
01:02:47.76 --> 01:02:52.72 hey you know Tracy it's good to have HR at the table she kind of sneaker'd look back to them and
01:02:52.72 --> 01:02:59.04 she's she is a very strong leader and she says we are the table and I was like you know what that's
01:02:59.04 --> 01:03:03.28 that's right and that's the theme throughout this book is the people or everything so when you
01:03:03.28 --> 01:03:09.36 start out deprioratizing your chief human resources officer and you make this an administrative
01:03:09.36 --> 01:03:16.24 function or an operational function you know how do you ever expect to get the best talent and talents
01:03:16.24 --> 01:03:19.52 which are having your product talents what's driving your service talents in front of your
01:03:19.52 --> 01:03:24.72 customers talent is driving your revenue that's everything and then you sit there and you look at
01:03:24.72 --> 01:03:29.36 your revenue and your revenues declining your traditions high your products not on time and you're
01:03:29.36 --> 01:03:35.92 going to go on gee I wonder what's going on and it it it it takes Mike and I about all of two seconds
01:03:35.92 --> 01:03:41.44 to to see that and it's unfortunate and one of the things that we really wanted to get across is
01:03:42.24 --> 01:03:47.52 you can really leverage HR in a strategic function and it makes all the difference to every single
01:03:47.52 --> 01:03:52.96 part of your business and the more of a talent mindset you have and the more that you empower
01:03:52.96 --> 01:03:58.24 human resources to be your strategic talent partner that revenue will come that product will be
01:03:58.24 --> 01:04:05.04 on time that service will be good it's it's not rocket science but in some places it's a brand
01:04:05.04 --> 01:04:11.52 in concept let's go back to that cost so there's there's an old attitude you can't outspend
01:04:11.52 --> 01:04:18.56 a good hiring process yeah because the consequences of having a poor hiring process can sink
01:04:19.12 --> 01:04:24.16 a company one of the statistics we found is that for senior level executive positions
01:04:24.72 --> 01:04:33.12 the cost of a bad senior leader can be 213% of that individual's annual salary so giving
01:04:33.12 --> 01:04:40.48 example if there you have a 300 thousand dollar salary CEO or executive that could cost the company is
01:04:40.48 --> 01:04:47.76 highest 639 thousand that's let's say that's a direct cost so what a lot of companies can't
01:04:47.76 --> 01:04:54.64 track from a tuition is really the the indirect cost and that's about two thirds of the cost of
01:04:54.64 --> 01:05:01.60 a tuition you can't put a number on the damage to a culture that a senior leader can cost
01:05:01.60 --> 01:05:06.48 maybe for two years that impacts sales and that's what's very hard for a lot of companies because
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:11.84 they can't see it on their bottom line directly good CEOs can come hang out to national
01:05:11.84 --> 01:05:16.16 on front and go work with some clients and you you'll get to see that all the time
01:05:16.96 --> 01:05:22.64 toxic leader a bad leader a leader with a negative attitude everyone below them either doesn't
01:05:22.64 --> 01:05:27.52 perform well or leaves if they're good and you know it is the good people as we said earlier the
01:05:27.52 --> 01:05:31.20 good people leave the bad people stay there and don't perform well that's what happens
01:05:31.20 --> 01:05:36.48 on their bad leader it's total nightmare what would see a little I think Henry Ford is
01:05:36.48 --> 01:05:40.40 credited with this quote they're at a board meeting and they were talking about leadership
01:05:40.40 --> 01:05:45.28 development and somebody said hey well what if we develop our people in they leave and Henry
01:05:45.28 --> 01:05:50.88 Ford looked at all them said what if we don't and they stay this is why leadership development
01:05:50.88 --> 01:05:56.000 matters so as you're reading that that section right there you saw George and I getting like
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.72 agitated we get we I mean this is how passionate we are this subject so through echelon front
01:06:02.72 --> 01:06:09.60 I spoke with a HR group there was like 500 HR leaders from an area we did it it was supposed to
01:06:09.60 --> 01:06:16.72 be in person conference code and so it was on mine but I had like 100 HR leaders reach out they
01:06:16.72 --> 01:06:21.84 were just fired up because I talked about the book like you guys are the key to the success
01:06:21.84 --> 01:06:28.24 of every organization don't let your leaders tell you otherwise so you know Tracey Kio and
01:06:28.24 --> 01:06:36.56 Paddy McCor you know Paddy McCor was the CHRO for Netflix built a strong organization both
01:06:36.56 --> 01:06:46.16 these wait what's Netflix yeah both these ladies should be CEOs of any Fortune 500 company
01:06:46.16 --> 01:06:52.24 they just have a passion for talent acquisition in talent management or leadership development and
01:06:52.24 --> 01:06:58.24 I mean you look at Tracey Kio Harvard educated cutter teeth and sales and marketing and was
01:06:58.24 --> 01:07:04.40 asked at one point during the career hey we've got a problem with you know HR can you go fix it
01:07:04.40 --> 01:07:10.72 of course answer was no they said good you got it and she developed a passion your HR leader
01:07:10.72 --> 01:07:18.80 has to be a business leader they have to and HR even though I love HR sometimes has become a
01:07:18.80 --> 01:07:26.72 dumping ground for average or mediocre performers and most often those HR leaders are just
01:07:26.72 --> 01:07:36.64 compliance leaders they're not a strategic function so if your HR reports into legal it's a compliance
01:07:36.64 --> 01:07:44.96 function if they report into finance it's an overhead function but as Tracey Kio will tell you
01:07:44.96 --> 01:07:50.64 if they report into the CEO and have a direct line and they're involved in the talent strategy
01:07:50.64 --> 01:07:54.64 then there's a chance in hell there's strategic function that is going to help build the organization
01:07:54.64 --> 01:08:01.36 into a world class organization and so that's where that misalignment between senior leaders in HR
01:08:01.36 --> 01:08:07.44 is killing a lot of organizations because back to the talent mindset yeah that's a big that's a big
01:08:07.44 --> 01:08:11.84 change actually it's not even that big of a change it's a little change that will have a huge impact
01:08:11.84 --> 01:08:17.36 you start getting people to really start to grow the or grow an organization properly with the
01:08:17.36 --> 01:08:23.44 right people that's exactly what you're talking about you go into this section here I'm skipping
01:08:23.44 --> 01:08:29.52 ahead this section here that I liked it's it's entitled fear based hiring special operations
01:08:29.52 --> 01:08:34.56 community has become world class model for potential based hiring which is their foundation of
01:08:34.56 --> 01:08:39.28 their assessment and selection process in contrast many companies instead of hiring the candidates
01:08:39.28 --> 01:08:45.20 with the most potential higher those candidates that inspire the least amount of fear
01:08:46.48 --> 01:08:53.68 this kind of fear based hiring usually comes down to one of three fallacies number one red flags
01:08:53.68 --> 01:09:00.96 are more important than green flags number two leaders shouldn't be outshined by their followers
01:09:00.96 --> 01:09:08.56 and number three somebody's better than nobody you go on in traditional corporate hiring practices
01:09:08.56 --> 01:09:16.64 the objective has seemingly shift from higher the best to higher the familiar and safe people are
01:09:16.64 --> 01:09:25.52 more afraid of a bad higher than they are excited by a good higher you go on here fear based hiring
01:09:25.52 --> 01:09:29.20 is dogmatic about objective requirements you guys already talked about this black and white
01:09:29.20 --> 01:09:34.88 criteria make it easy to say yes or no does this person have ex years of industry experience does
01:09:34.88 --> 01:09:40.08 this person have wide degree these criteria don't matter nearly as much as you might think
01:09:40.08 --> 01:09:46.56 the ten-conylbrient decor former commander of army special forces assessment selection told us
01:09:46.56 --> 01:09:52.64 when I arrived in my command anything easily measured was heavily weighted in the selection process
01:09:52.64 --> 01:09:56.88 the problem was it didn't have a lot of predictive value the same is true in business
01:09:57.92 --> 01:10:01.52 just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's important and just because you can't
01:10:01.52 --> 01:10:07.20 measure something doesn't mean it's not important the only question that truly matters is does
01:10:07.20 --> 01:10:13.28 this person have the potential to be a top performer don't disregard red flags entirely but don't
01:10:13.28 --> 01:10:18.88 obsess over them either in combat you don't want to get shot but at the same time if you're
01:10:18.88 --> 01:10:24.08 primary concern is not getting shot then you don't go into battle if you make your hiring
01:10:24.08 --> 01:10:29.84 decision based on avoiding your worst case scenario you'll never achieve your best case scenario
01:10:29.84 --> 01:10:35.20 it's far more effective to look for green flags than for red flags oh people are scared
01:10:35.20 --> 01:10:41.20 you know and and and and and I don't want to get too far down into the minutia but if you're
01:10:41.20 --> 01:10:46.24 a manager and you've got an empty seat so many people that I've seen over 20 years are like
01:10:46.24 --> 01:10:50.72 I'm going to lose that seat if I don't get it filled with somebody I'm going to get somebody in there
01:10:50.72 --> 01:10:56.08 so anybody is better than somebody then they go down the objective requirements like well they
01:10:56.08 --> 01:11:00.56 don't have this they don't have this and so they're checking off red flags of objective requirements
01:11:00.56 --> 01:11:04.72 to put somebody roll and never asking the question is this the person with the character
01:11:04.72 --> 01:11:09.92 attributes that can do the job they're not looking they're they're literally scared well
01:11:09.92 --> 01:11:16.08 if I hire this person and oh they don't have five years how am I going to be looked at what
01:11:16.08 --> 01:11:22.40 if they don't do as well as I think and they don't they don't think that their leadership can
01:11:22.40 --> 01:11:27.76 take somebody with the right characteristics two or three years less experience than they
01:11:27.76 --> 01:11:32.64 mark and put them in the role and and and coach him to succeed they're they're scared to death
01:11:32.64 --> 01:11:38.000 they want it it just turns into this machine how fast how fast can you hire how fast can you get
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.68 that butt in the seat I'll take that step further at the risk of being a little bit of a
01:11:44.64 --> 01:11:52.72 stereo typing people but who's hungrier the person that you know has two years experience going
01:11:52.72 --> 01:11:57.12 into a role that needs five years experience or wait will you know or the person that has seven
01:11:57.12 --> 01:12:01.52 years experience going into a role with five years experience required who's who's hungrier
01:12:01.52 --> 01:12:05.52 who's trying to prove themselves a little bit more I don't know man I'm going to be in
01:12:05.52 --> 01:12:11.04 Georgia to hear hungry individual that wants to prove themselves and and and I've seen this time
01:12:11.04 --> 01:12:16.56 and again is you know the recruiters that I've brought up to town acquisition specialist I call
01:12:16.56 --> 01:12:19.12 them talent consultants because they're really embedded in the business they'll go
01:12:19.68 --> 01:12:23.36 have talked with this guy yeah they're two or three years lied on the experience you were asking
01:12:23.36 --> 01:12:28.08 for I promise you this hungry they're hungry they want it they want to get after it
01:12:28.08 --> 01:12:32.96 and the manager says well they don't have the seven years of experience and it goes back to
01:12:32.96 --> 01:12:38.16 what Brian Decker said you know they picked seven years almost out of the year that seven years
01:12:38.16 --> 01:12:44.16 is not predictive of success working for a competitor is not predictive of success
01:12:45.52 --> 01:12:52.32 character attributes are predictive and you need to be watching for those check
01:12:52.32 --> 01:12:59.84 another fear but fear-based hiring problem leaders shouldn't be outshined by the followers
01:12:59.84 --> 01:13:04.64 average or underperforming managers often fear hiring someone who outshined them because they
01:13:04.64 --> 01:13:09.12 don't want to hire themselves out of a job there should never be a maximum standard for talent
01:13:09.12 --> 01:13:13.84 only a minimum if you're not hiring people better than your current employees you'll never
01:13:13.84 --> 01:13:19.20 raise the bar for talent within your organization that's just the classic surround yourself with
01:13:19.20 --> 01:13:24.48 people better better than you I want to work myself out of a job I want to have and we go in
01:13:24.48 --> 01:13:28.56 a little bit later about succession planning I need to have as many people who can take my
01:13:28.56 --> 01:13:33.04 place and corporate mercados and do that you know the succession planning we do in the military
01:13:33.04 --> 01:13:38.24 to muscle memory but I always want people who are going to push me to be a better leader they're
01:13:38.24 --> 01:13:42.64 going to push me to get better at my game to up the game I mean when you roll with people do you
01:13:42.64 --> 01:13:46.40 roll with people that are easy to beat sometimes
01:13:46.40 --> 01:13:53.60 something I can't I might want this this toxic environment right now it's here for an hour
01:13:53.60 --> 01:13:59.36 it's waiting for a moment that's the first moment for echo Charles to shine yeah sometimes I do
01:13:59.36 --> 01:14:08.56 roll with people that are easier a lot easier you do somebody's better than nobody and you you
01:14:08.56 --> 01:14:12.16 know you talked about that just feeling like we better get someone in the platoon and you know
01:14:12.16 --> 01:14:19.28 this happened in in Charlie Ptun life had a guy a good guy but he just wasn't really didn't
01:14:19.28 --> 01:14:25.20 really have the just couldn't get the job done and you know coach and we wrote about it in
01:14:25.20 --> 01:14:30.16 dichotomy and leadership but one of the things that I told Laef I said hey Laef if you get rid
01:14:30.16 --> 01:14:34.24 of this guy you're not getting another one I mean there's there's you know you're going to go
01:14:34.24 --> 01:14:39.36 on deployment you're just with missing a guy and because we're going to we're going to get rid of
01:14:39.36 --> 01:14:46.000 and you know Laef was like well and he thought about it he said you know what I think we're
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.64 better off without him and you know that to me that was a little litness test for me because you know
01:14:50.64 --> 01:14:53.60 Laef might be thinking hey I'll just replace him with some other guy and we'll you know we'll
01:14:53.60 --> 01:14:58.80 step it up it was a litness test for me to see what Laef really was thinking and if you really
01:14:58.80 --> 01:15:06.000 would rather not take someone that means you don't feel comfortable with him at all so there's a quote
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.32 from Charlie Beckwith for the listeners Charlie Beckwith is the founder of Delta Force you know
01:15:12.32 --> 01:15:18.56 surf time with the SAS which generated the idea for for a specialized force yet a quote that was
01:15:18.56 --> 01:15:29.12 I'd rather go down the river with seven studs than 100 shitheads and it goes to point that
01:15:29.12 --> 01:15:33.84 yeah I'd rather select highly talented people into the organization and have less people
01:15:33.84 --> 01:15:41.04 than you know falling quantity is not better than quality never has been and you know the the quote
01:15:41.04 --> 01:15:50.48 from her kill her your clippers the Greek philosopher 500 BC about the 100 soldiers on the
01:15:50.48 --> 01:15:59.36 on the battlefield 80 or sorry 80 or just targets tend to even deserve to be there and then there's
01:15:59.36 --> 01:16:04.96 10 that are warriors but that one that one will always bring us home I mean these guys all talked about
01:16:04.96 --> 01:16:10.000 the the importance of talent and you'd rather bring talent people in individually
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.76 then build a massive quick army that's when you deviate from the process it works out poorly for you
01:16:15.76 --> 01:16:20.48 yeah when you bring the wrong person in you're actually just creating more drain on your time
01:16:20.48 --> 01:16:25.68 just mayhem yeah mayhem and then it's a cancer and then your A players are looking at you going
01:16:25.68 --> 01:16:32.40 why do you bring a sea player in and now it reflects on you as the leader that your bar
01:16:32.40 --> 01:16:36.80 wasn't high enough the your standards weren't high enough that you were tolerating this sea player
01:16:36.80 --> 01:16:42.000 this be player and we all don't have that works out and never ever well
01:16:46.08 --> 01:16:54.72 next section what makes special operations so special and in here you you kind of profile
01:16:54.72 --> 01:17:04.40 one individual an individual by the name of Johnny Kim which podcast 2021 you can listen
01:17:04.40 --> 01:17:11.76 Johnny Kim's story it's it's just unbelievable what what made you want to profile Johnny in here
01:17:12.56 --> 01:17:20.08 so Johnny and I and Ryan were all in the same but class and what stuck out about Johnny now
01:17:20.08 --> 01:17:25.44 it goes back to why I was judging Ryan you got to understand my career prior to that I'd finished
01:17:25.44 --> 01:17:29.12 number one in pretty much every military school from boot camp in school of infantry
01:17:29.92 --> 01:17:34.08 finished third and recon school out of thirty behind two guys that went on to be Marzokde at one
01:17:34.88 --> 01:17:40.48 even you know graduate number one from Reno CS so when you're on a successful track what
01:17:40.48 --> 01:17:43.60 what happens you become a little bit arrogant you think you have things figured out and I thought
01:17:43.60 --> 01:17:49.36 I had things figured out naturally because I was still a sergeant in the Marine Corps the class
01:17:49.36 --> 01:17:53.12 sort of gravitated towards me because I had a rough neck style of leadership and they loved it and
01:17:53.12 --> 01:17:59.60 the instructors loved it as well but Johnny I just sort of always dismissed Johnny because small
01:18:00.64 --> 01:18:07.20 Asian kid Korean from LA just you know he's sort of I don't want to say devoid of emotion
01:18:07.20 --> 01:18:12.24 he's not he's not a showy guy and naturally because he didn't have a flame buoyant personality
01:18:12.24 --> 01:18:16.16 I figured out the sketches not performed it he's just another one of the the students that
01:18:16.16 --> 01:18:19.12 he was going to drop or go make it through and be a non-factor in the sealed teams
01:18:21.36 --> 01:18:26.72 in this book I think you're seeing that I show my ass a lot in these assumptions that I made about
01:18:26.72 --> 01:18:31.28 you know who's going to be a good seal and who wasn't and you know usually that was wrong
01:18:31.28 --> 01:18:36.16 but those are the scars as you get involved in town acquisition it is like you don't
01:18:36.16 --> 01:18:41.20 become better at this process of assessing and selecting the right people in your organization
01:18:41.20 --> 01:18:45.20 unless you screw up yeah I'd say your assessment was wrong
01:18:45.20 --> 01:18:53.76 on multiple levels because not only is Johnny Kim an awesome seal and ranks you know above
01:18:53.76 --> 01:19:00.56 among the highest of you know respect in the seal teams but then just as a human I mean then
01:19:00.56 --> 01:19:06.40 as a Harvard doctor and then as an astronaut and then just basically as an overall human being
01:19:06.40 --> 01:19:14.40 he's right up there with very rare fire there so I talked to Johnny what I you know I wanted to
01:19:14.40 --> 01:19:18.80 get approved through NASA that he was good he read you know I think the instructors looked
01:19:18.80 --> 01:19:24.08 Johnny and they just sort of you made a snap of judge judgment you know he's just quite
01:19:24.08 --> 01:19:29.52 little guy and watching him because again we both reported in the sealed team three my job
01:19:29.52 --> 01:19:34.96 just continued to drop because he was better than I was was day one out of Buds I mean he was just
01:19:34.96 --> 01:19:39.68 that smart where he picked up everything quickly you know 18 delta now he's a high speed medic
01:19:39.68 --> 01:19:46.24 quickly rushed to sniper school becomes a sniper you know you either be treating
01:19:46.24 --> 01:19:49.92 casualties on the battlefield or he'd be pulling the trigger eliminating Islamic
01:19:49.92 --> 01:19:58.000 extremists and the guy was amazing and humbled to to to have served with him and
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.84 based off his podcast we had a very close conversation about one night in the soccer city
01:20:02.64 --> 01:20:08.48 which you know was a bad night for everyone but ultimately that was on stone or an eye
01:20:08.48 --> 01:20:13.84 that we even let the guys go out when we knew we weren't ready but yeah it's the the point with
01:20:13.84 --> 01:20:17.12 Johnny's a lot of people just would have looked past him quickly because you know he didn't have
01:20:17.12 --> 01:20:26.24 college degree from LA nothing stood out on paper because you you want you know peel that on you back
01:20:27.28 --> 01:20:33.60 yeah I think I think a good word to describe Johnny that you would pick up is just unassuming right
01:20:33.60 --> 01:20:40.88 he's just I think he just she's just unassuming and he that's what he is I mean it's it's
01:20:40.88 --> 01:20:46.80 less now because you kind of people know his background now so I'm sure that just comes across
01:20:46.80 --> 01:20:55.52 but it's super just a super humble on the unassuming guy and yeah uh a beast now I tell people
01:20:55.52 --> 01:21:00.72 I worked with Johnny Kim you know I start with Johnny Kim that's awesome
01:21:00.72 --> 01:21:10.72 the origins of the soft talent minds at the very core of soft is a talent mindset the idea
01:21:10.72 --> 01:21:14.32 that small group of talented individuals can be effective fighting force capable of defeating
01:21:14.32 --> 01:21:20.56 larger enemy forces in delivering strict strategic impacts through skull small scale operations
01:21:20.56 --> 01:21:27.60 three innate traits of lead spot special operations talent mindset and subsequent success one
01:21:27.60 --> 01:21:35.04 no one has prior special operations experience so raw talent must be the selection criteria
01:21:35.76 --> 01:21:40.16 the most effective selection is based on mindset and character that's a crazy thing to think about
01:21:41.12 --> 01:21:46.80 that when you go into special operations they're most of the time there's zero experience
01:21:46.80 --> 01:21:52.08 in special operations you know that's just that's like a crazy thing to think about
01:21:52.08 --> 01:21:58.40 where does that seal come from he comes from a high school you know this is the story you know
01:21:58.40 --> 01:22:01.92 we're working with business leaders and they think they need to experience it so important I
01:22:01.92 --> 01:22:06.32 say hey I don't go to a high school and say hey we're recruiting for Navy SEALS raise a hand if you
01:22:06.32 --> 01:22:11.68 have special operations experience don't it guys you did you know it was your bowl hate French foreign
01:22:11.68 --> 01:22:17.60 Legion the UK special forces go get some experience come back and uh and then let us know
01:22:17.60 --> 01:22:24.16 uh next one special operations for since our teams teams win not individuals number three special
01:22:24.16 --> 01:22:28.72 operations teams work in high stakes environments when the stakes are high mediocrity is unacceptable
01:22:29.28 --> 01:22:35.36 let's look more closely at these traits raw talent this is this is no emphasis on experience
01:22:35.36 --> 01:22:39.76 raw talent is difficult to identify industry experience on the other hand is far easier to identify
01:22:39.76 --> 01:22:44.80 and measure this is why business world often falls in the bad habit of overaligning on industry
01:22:44.80 --> 01:22:50.32 experience and as a hiring criterion special operations does not have that luxury because nobody has
01:22:50.32 --> 01:22:55.44 prior special operations experience if the soft community began selecting for industry experience
01:22:55.44 --> 01:22:59.68 the US would not have a special operations community out of necessity special operations had
01:22:59.68 --> 01:23:06.000 to develop a core competency in potential based hiring where raw talent is the primary consideration
01:23:07.84 --> 01:23:12.96 that's self-explanatory next one team mentality special operations forces are structured as teams they
01:23:12.96 --> 01:23:17.52 are incentivized as teams and they win or lose as teams not as individuals in contrast in the
01:23:17.52 --> 01:23:23.12 biz world in the business world the egos can often rule and the team can be less and emphasized
01:23:23.84 --> 01:23:28.48 people are rewarded for individual achievements so individuals are often concerned only about
01:23:28.48 --> 01:23:33.44 their incentives versus the overall health of the organization bad leaders who hire and manage
01:23:33.44 --> 01:23:39.92 others often accept and often and even encourage mediocre employees because it raises their own value
01:23:39.92 --> 01:23:49.60 in comparison a team mentality greatly reduces the power of ego yeah there's nothing worse than
01:23:49.60 --> 01:23:54.80 encouraging mediocre people to be in your organization so that you can look good
01:23:58.48 --> 01:24:00.40 does you have something on that Mike?
01:24:00.40 --> 01:24:07.76 I do let me hit back on the lack of industry experience to real vignette so again we quoted
01:24:07.76 --> 01:24:12.80 Charlie Beckwith if you didn't know it because we also interviewed what we didn't interview
01:24:12.80 --> 01:24:17.44 Charlie Beckwith because he's passed but we did interview throughout this book a guy named
01:24:17.44 --> 01:24:24.64 General Jerry Boykin amazing individual was a long time dealt a forced memory even the commander
01:24:25.20 --> 01:24:30.72 was involved in desert one operation the equal claw so you know we went into the history
01:24:30.72 --> 01:24:35.44 Charlie Beckwith was a strong believer that before you could even get into special operations
01:24:35.44 --> 01:24:40.96 and this was the old sort of mentality that that that existed within the military that you have to
01:24:40.96 --> 01:24:45.92 serve as a conventional soldier either an officer and listed before you could try out for special
01:24:45.92 --> 01:24:52.32 operations and he was very dogmatic about that and General Boykin talked about when the
01:24:52.32 --> 01:24:57.52 Army Special Forces community created the 18 X-ray program because of the needs of the war where they
01:24:57.52 --> 01:25:04.24 took people directly off the street that had the right attributes past the initial tests intelligence
01:25:04.24 --> 01:25:12.48 physical standards mental standards that they actually made as good of special forces soldiers
01:25:12.48 --> 01:25:17.68 if not better because they didn't have bad habits from the conventional forces that was one of you
01:25:17.68 --> 01:25:23.76 so let's put that into a private sector you know context the other vignette google did a
01:25:23.76 --> 01:25:31.44 study on what made their most successful managers so successful they they they they came up with
01:25:31.44 --> 01:25:37.20 ten criterion that made them so highly successful industry experience came in a number number nine
01:25:37.20 --> 01:25:42.000 it was one of the the least important things now if you look at extreme ownership pretty much all
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.68 these principles of how we lead were much farther ahead than the importance of extreme I'm sorry
01:25:47.68 --> 01:25:53.76 the industry experience so that's why this potential based hiring is so much more powerful than
01:25:53.76 --> 01:26:02.72 objective trivial requirements like industry experience when when they started the 18 X when did they do that
01:26:03.44 --> 01:26:10.64 I want to say that was roughly around 2003 2004 that that program came to revolution
01:26:10.64 --> 01:26:16.32 I'd have to go back and find the exact year yeah John strike reminder was talking about that
01:26:16.32 --> 01:26:21.28 and how there was like people in the special forces community that were saying all this is
01:26:21.28 --> 01:26:26.000 garbage you're gonna get these guys that don't know what they're doing but like so many of those
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:33.76 sag operators went right from boot camp to you know to a it and then on the special force
01:26:33.76 --> 01:26:38.72 and then they went right over to Vietnam and freaking just got after he he like was laughing about it
01:26:38.72 --> 01:26:44.88 because those guys were just freaking legit what with general boikom was telling the story you know
01:26:44.88 --> 01:26:49.52 you had senior leaders when he was the commander of use to sock which is he's the commander of
01:26:49.52 --> 01:26:54.56 all army special operations and they were arguing there's two camps of no we can't accept people
01:26:54.56 --> 01:26:59.44 without conventional infantry experience and the other camp was hey know we can take people off
01:26:59.44 --> 01:27:04.000 the street and turn them into great special forces soldiers and of course what there is a command
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.12 soldier major use to sock sitting back the senior and listed visor wall both camps fought
01:27:09.12 --> 01:27:16.48 and finally he said when he piped in he said hey I was an OJT soldier in Vietnam I didn't go to
01:27:16.48 --> 01:27:21.36 the special forces qualification course they sent me right over to uh to to Vietnam and I learned
01:27:21.36 --> 01:27:26.32 the job well outside in the wire and they all shut up and you said okay there you go
01:27:26.32 --> 01:27:33.36 right uh last thing high stakes perhaps more than any other factor the high stakes under which
01:27:33.36 --> 01:27:40.72 the soft operators under which soft operates necessitate a talent mindset war and combat are among
01:27:40.72 --> 01:27:44.40 the most unforgiving environments in the world on the stake on the battlefield can mean the
01:27:44.40 --> 01:27:49.28 difference between life and death not only for oneself but for ones fellow soldiers a failed
01:27:49.28 --> 01:27:53.92 mission can mean the destruction of cities and the loss of civilian life excellence and execution
01:27:53.92 --> 01:27:58.64 is the standard because it has to be the stakes are that high it should be no difference in bit
01:27:58.64 --> 01:28:03.52 different in business in business the risk may not be life or death but the stakes are incredibly
01:28:03.52 --> 01:28:09.04 high don't fool yourself businesses war war by nonviolent means the result of a bad hire or
01:28:09.04 --> 01:28:16.24 several bad hires is the underperformance of the business if not a nose dive to bankruptcy it is
01:28:16.24 --> 01:28:21.52 not literal death but it is death in the marketplace that death spells disaster for you and your
01:28:21.52 --> 01:28:30.32 employees whose well-being depends on the health of your organization look at today covid hit us
01:28:31.44 --> 01:28:37.12 for those people that have these attributes as leaders they'll factor there's like okay hey that's
01:28:37.12 --> 01:28:41.68 part of the environment we got to operate in let's go do it all right hey let's you know let's
01:28:41.68 --> 01:28:45.36 prioritize what we got to pay attention to how do we pay attention to our people how do we pay
01:28:45.36 --> 01:28:48.96 attention to our product how do we continue to drive the revenue and take care of our people
01:28:49.76 --> 01:28:54.24 and it and it was it just didn't phase those people and I've been around quite a few of them
01:28:54.24 --> 01:29:00.64 were it was like okay yeah we got covid okay and what's your point but you can start to see
01:29:00.64 --> 01:29:05.44 those companies where that talent wasn't there where that talent mindset where that leadership
01:29:05.44 --> 01:29:11.52 wasn't there covid hits they lose their minds what did they do let's start cutting people let's
01:29:11.52 --> 01:29:18.32 cut this let's cut this immediately we'll we're going through today speaks exactly to
01:29:19.04 --> 01:29:23.84 why it's so critical to have a talent mindset and get people with those character attributes
01:29:24.40 --> 01:29:28.56 in the roles that make a difference and and and I love but you guys have pointed out earlier
01:29:28.56 --> 01:29:32.48 the US military is in the most powerful force in the world it's the US economy and that was one of
01:29:32.48 --> 01:29:38.16 the things we wanted to do with this book was to we want to continue to contribute to strengthen that
01:29:41.44 --> 01:29:48.08 you go into a skip and ahead a little bit you go into a scenario and it just it just spells out
01:29:48.08 --> 01:29:52.88 exactly what you're talking about you got a guy Daniel you go into this Daniel's looking to
01:29:52.88 --> 01:29:58.56 hire candidates for sales leadership position and he used two search firms EF Overwatch which is
01:29:58.56 --> 01:30:05.36 what which is excellent front and a competitor and Jeremy so this is here's the two people
01:30:05.36 --> 01:30:11.52 that got presented Jeremy presented by a competitive search firm 3.9 GPA from a prestigious
01:30:11.52 --> 01:30:15.92 university high intelligence four years of industry experience with two different companies
01:30:15.92 --> 01:30:25.44 driven highly competent borderline arrogant Chris presented by EF Overwatch 3.2 GPA from a
01:30:25.44 --> 01:30:30.96 public university above average intelligence faced significant adversity in life came from a
01:30:30.96 --> 01:30:35.52 lower middle class family and held a full-time job on college recently separated army infantry
01:30:35.52 --> 01:30:40.40 officer who held several different functional billets in the army has all the attributes
01:30:40.40 --> 01:30:46.24 are required to be a highly successful sales leader but lacks industry experience which of these
01:30:46.24 --> 01:30:51.28 candidates would you choose since this chapter is about hiring for character in scale you might know
01:30:51.28 --> 01:30:56.48 the answer is most likely Chris not Jeremy but be honest at your company which one of these
01:30:56.48 --> 01:31:01.76 candidates would most likely be hired that's a good question when you put be honest in front of it
01:31:02.48 --> 01:31:05.84 because right because it's a fear-based hire is to go you know what we don't know about this
01:31:05.84 --> 01:31:11.12 Chris guy he seems like a good guy using the army but man Jeremy he's got four years of experience
01:31:12.56 --> 01:31:16.72 you go on most companies would choose Jeremy without hesitation Chris's GPA was average
01:31:16.72 --> 01:31:22.56 compares to Jeremy's but he didn't have the industry specific experience but he was one of those
01:31:22.56 --> 01:31:26.16 people who perform time and time again whatever you put in front of him you'd find a way through it
01:31:26.16 --> 01:31:34.24 over it or around it he was relentless and adaptable so you go on they they have eventually chose
01:31:34.24 --> 01:31:40.000 Jeremy over Chris and two weeks later the guy calls up and says we made a huge mistake
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:50.08 that's how it turns out that click that click time and time again it and here's the funny thing is
01:31:51.28 --> 01:31:58.88 you remember tray holder who helped us out during the infancy of if ever watched we had this call
01:31:58.88 --> 01:32:06.64 and it was either we can have to two weeks after they made that selection and this leader within
01:32:06.64 --> 01:32:12.40 the company who we had a personal relationship said hey this guy is an arrogant you know what he's
01:32:12.40 --> 01:32:17.68 like we've got a problem and you know we're not going to say hey we told you so the guy he's trying
01:32:17.68 --> 01:32:23.60 to run a major distribution center he made a call we're there to support him and our basic
01:32:23.60 --> 01:32:28.48 question was well do you want to talk to our candidate he said no and said we asked what what are you
01:32:28.48 --> 01:32:34.16 going to do about it he said nothing and I just asked him was said if you have some of the
01:32:34.16 --> 01:32:39.44 that you feel is going to poison the culture why aren't you going to do anything and it was if I
01:32:39.44 --> 01:32:46.000 get let him go two weeks into the job my senior leaders are going to look at me like what are you
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.88 doing down there and so that individual was going to let it ride I haven't talked to him I don't
01:32:50.88 --> 01:32:55.68 know if that individual stayed and sometimes things changed within four you know a few weeks maybe
01:32:55.68 --> 01:33:01.44 that that individual who was arrogant came around but uh well you think the chances of that are
01:33:01.44 --> 01:33:07.12 very well it's but how often it and let's you know we talked a lot about special operations
01:33:07.12 --> 01:33:12.72 and how great of an organization is how great they are selecting high potentials but how often
01:33:12.72 --> 01:33:19.68 if we're being honest with ourselves did we let mediocracy rain within the seal teams yeah I
01:33:19.68 --> 01:33:26.48 mean you need you need people and what what was horrible you know I didn't mind that look you
01:33:26.48 --> 01:33:29.76 you got to have people that are going to do some of the jobs that are a little bit easier in the
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:33.44 teams I mean it's just the reality the situation and you know when I was going through officer candidate
01:33:33.44 --> 01:33:39.44 school I had whatever 80 people in my class in my officer candidate class I was the class president
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:49.68 and you got to write like suggestions to the drill instructor and or whatever so I guess a group of
01:33:49.68 --> 01:33:53.92 people like four or five people because I had a bunch of prior and listed guys in my class all great
01:33:53.92 --> 01:34:00.40 guys and and female as well there's guys and girls in there and somebody wrote to the the drill instructor
01:34:00.40 --> 01:34:07.04 and said we need to get rid of these four people they don't belong they don't belong as officers
01:34:07.04 --> 01:34:15.76 in the Navy and so my drill instructor whose name was gunnery sergeant seals oddly enough great guy
01:34:15.76 --> 01:34:21.04 you know as you know I mean any Marine Corps drill instructors just freaking out standing so he
01:34:21.04 --> 01:34:28.32 gets up and he says hey I'll tell you what let's say we get rid of the bottom 10% of this class
01:34:30.56 --> 01:34:36.000 and he says now what happens tomorrow we got a new bottom 10% what happens after that we got a new
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.44 bottom 10% so eventually realize you can guess what there's going to be a bell curve in any
01:34:41.44 --> 01:34:46.40 organization where I have a problem with this so so that's my explanation like hey the seal teams
01:34:46.40 --> 01:34:51.36 look you're gonna have some guys that are not the not long ball hitters you know you're gonna have
01:34:51.36 --> 01:34:56.32 some guys that are not long ball hitters the problem I have and and had and still have
01:34:57.20 --> 01:35:02.48 is when you take those guys and you put them in the leadership positions that's where it's a problem
01:35:02.48 --> 01:35:06.000 that's where it's a real problem in my book and we still love that to happen yeah it happened we
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.92 still love that to happen because hey they've put in their time they've earned that spot you that's
01:35:09.92 --> 01:35:14.88 not a good criteria first off I'm gonna say you guys have a suggestion box in Navy officer
01:35:14.88 --> 01:35:19.44 candid school yeah it wasn't really a suggestion box I don't I don't that's why I couldn't really
01:35:19.44 --> 01:35:25.20 name what it was but it was some way of communicating with the drone structure I don't I forget what
01:35:25.20 --> 01:35:31.76 it was because I didn't do it but because I'm just gonna say it Marine Corps officer candid school
01:35:31.76 --> 01:35:36.64 that was called the trash can and the drone structures did not care you was a suggestion to you
01:35:36.64 --> 01:35:40.32 I don't know I don't know where I don't know where this idea came from I'm thinking to must have
01:35:40.32 --> 01:35:44.80 been some kind of suggestion box or maybe they raised their hands and asked him I don't know
01:35:44.80 --> 01:35:50.24 but it was it was the reason I remember it it was somehow clandestine right they weren't they didn't
01:35:50.24 --> 01:35:54.08 say in the middle of a class like because we used to basically get briefed all the time saying
01:35:54.08 --> 01:35:57.12 in the hallways the barracks you know you'd all say it out front of your rooms you're all in big
01:35:57.12 --> 01:36:06.000 lines so no one had the courage to say hey officer candid Smith Jones and and brown need to be
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.52 let go no one had the courage to that so they somehow through some mechanism and I get your humor
01:36:11.52 --> 01:36:18.72 through some mechanism they they got to the to the drone structure and yeah I don't know what
01:36:18.72 --> 01:36:29.04 that mechanism was but no the the navy officer candid school was pretty good to go I thought
01:36:29.04 --> 01:36:32.88 how did good time we we so we actually one of the candidates to came to you if ever watch
01:36:32.88 --> 01:36:36.72 fighter pilot actually was going through the training because we hold webinars every Friday
01:36:36.72 --> 01:36:42.000 both in leadership and then career search and struck a quarter of this guy he actually moved
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.80 to Austin he's like hey just just so you know I went to officer candid school with with Chaka
01:36:46.80 --> 01:36:54.80 with willing yeah he's like that guy saw later so you bring up a point that again we nerd out on this
01:36:54.80 --> 01:37:01.60 yeah all talent follows a bell curve or normal distribution curve and you know that that is a
01:37:01.60 --> 01:37:07.60 fundamental truth however the performance within that talent distribution is more like a I'm sorry
01:37:07.60 --> 01:37:11.36 the the the performance is more along lines of a power distribution or some people call it the
01:37:11.36 --> 01:37:17.04 paradeo principle it's just 80% of the results driven within your organization come from 20% of the
01:37:17.04 --> 01:37:23.28 workforce that's that's it's just the realities as you say but ultimately what makes better
01:37:23.28 --> 01:37:28.48 organizations and as we did the research is that competing companies within the industry all have
01:37:28.48 --> 01:37:34.96 that bell curve it's you want the average performance of your entire workforce the statistical mean
01:37:35.84 --> 01:37:40.64 to be higher than your competitors yeah and that's what makes special operations
01:37:41.28 --> 01:37:47.84 so great is that not everyone's a a player they're not that's a small element the the long tail
01:37:49.28 --> 01:37:54.48 but the overall performance of the entire force is much higher yeah you know slide that
01:37:54.48 --> 01:38:01.44 thing to the right yeah that's the goal for sure so we're talking all about all this you know
01:38:01.44 --> 01:38:06.56 experience and and how that's not the most important thing but then you guys go on to say this
01:38:06.56 --> 01:38:10.56 which is also important we're not advocating that you disregard experience entirely you're not
01:38:10.56 --> 01:38:14.80 going to hire kids straight out of high school for a C-suite position experience and past performance
01:38:14.80 --> 01:38:19.92 matters for certain positions but you do need to be thoughtful about how you use experience
01:38:19.92 --> 01:38:25.52 in the selection process we see companies make three common mistakes when it comes to looking
01:38:25.52 --> 01:38:31.12 experience one they require experience that doesn't matter to job performance two they require
01:38:31.12 --> 01:38:36.72 very specific experience when general experience would be just as good and three they prioritize
01:38:36.72 --> 01:38:42.80 industry experience over character so you guys aren't saying to ignore experience you're saying
01:38:42.80 --> 01:38:49.12 hey pay attention to it exactly it's and ultimately it's not what counts and you know one of the other
01:38:49.12 --> 01:38:53.36 fallacies is you know if I have somebody with experience it was working at this competitor and I
01:38:53.36 --> 01:38:59.12 bring them in well they were successful there they'll be successful here that that's just I boggles my
01:38:59.12 --> 01:39:04.32 mind and I see it all the time but yeah these are the three the three mistakes and you know we talk
01:39:04.32 --> 01:39:10.80 about this in the book about gates once you set your requirements for this role and they meet those
01:39:10.80 --> 01:39:18.08 that gate then closes everything after that is this part of what determines success as far as the
01:39:18.08 --> 01:39:23.44 nine attributes and most people and you'll and on the ground level you'll watch a person come in you've
01:39:23.44 --> 01:39:28.08 got these objective requirements and you'll have five people in the hiring process all these five
01:39:28.08 --> 01:39:32.64 different members of the team and they will all ask different versions of the same questions about
01:39:32.64 --> 01:39:41.04 their experience nobody's digging in nobody's digging in it I you know it's patience is a
01:39:41.04 --> 01:39:47.92 virtue in my function I assure you and but they're listing out experience and hiring majors will
01:39:47.92 --> 01:39:53.04 dump all of this stuff in thinking if I get all of this this experience and one person my company will
01:39:53.04 --> 01:39:58.24 do better they're looking at the wrong things it's the character it's those attributes that make the
01:39:58.24 --> 01:40:04.24 difference when when a COVID comes up when when a when another company comes out with a product when
01:40:04.80 --> 01:40:09.44 you know we're behind or or we're short team members it's those character attributes that drive
01:40:09.44 --> 01:40:15.76 that team forward when things get tough when you're under stress that's when character reveals
01:40:15.76 --> 01:40:23.52 itself and in the business world that's when it counts the most so we over rotate on experience
01:40:24.24 --> 01:40:29.84 and you know you know Mike and I try to go to great lengths in this book look we understand
01:40:29.84 --> 01:40:34.56 your business leader you've got 50,000 things going on if you're a CEO you've got a million
01:40:34.56 --> 01:40:40.64 things going on in your head but this will help you be better this is the competitive advantage
01:40:40.64 --> 01:40:46.000 that you need and is prioritizing talent and these things that make the difference and yet these
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.12 three common mistakes they happen time and time and time again they will happen 10 times a day in
01:40:51.12 --> 01:40:55.84 one company and that's a small company you get to a big company some of the fortune 50 that I've
01:40:55.84 --> 01:41:02.96 worked with you'll see this a thousand times in one day and it and it multiplies itself but you guys have
01:41:02.96 --> 01:41:08.88 both seen and I've seen it in my time you get a good leader you get talent on your team that's infectious
01:41:08.88 --> 01:41:14.08 the game comes up you get a good player you get a rock star you're all like okay I'm chasing that guy
01:41:14.08 --> 01:41:19.12 I'm coming up I gotta elevate my game because this is not looking good for me you know person
01:41:19.12 --> 01:41:24.96 I love person on my right they're out trying to me I gotta step it up so you know you've got to
01:41:24.96 --> 01:41:29.20 get the experience that's minimum for the job hey you gotta be able to do these things in the job
01:41:29.20 --> 01:41:36.32 it doesn't matter we're not saying disregard it don't make it so specific that is really now talent
01:41:36.32 --> 01:41:42.24 and that happens a lot and industry experience is not as important as you think and I mean google
01:41:42.24 --> 01:41:47.44 points it out I mean it you know statistically it's not important but it makes managers feel better
01:41:47.44 --> 01:41:51.92 oh I took somebody from my competitor they were doing really well they know our industry they're
01:41:51.92 --> 01:41:58.24 gonna do well here it's just a fallacy and and if we can get people focused on character if we get
01:41:58.24 --> 01:42:05.04 people focused on leadership that will power your company when the hard times come hey you're
01:42:05.04 --> 01:42:10.24 gonna rock it you're gonna survive you're gonna make the U.S. economy that much more powerful
01:42:10.24 --> 01:42:15.92 if you get the right mindset and you focus and you drive and get after it Brian Decker
01:42:15.92 --> 01:42:20.56 talked about this with special forces assessment selection so to get into any of these special
01:42:20.56 --> 01:42:25.44 operations community intellectual horsepowers requirement you have to have a minimum score we take
01:42:25.44 --> 01:42:31.68 as bad there's a score once person passes that intelligence requirement what George is talking
01:42:31.68 --> 01:42:36.88 about is that gate is closed it no longer comes back into the planning factor the hiring factor
01:42:36.88 --> 01:42:42.24 whatsoever and what they found is that level they put a lot of thought behind it and what they see
01:42:42.24 --> 01:42:48.000 is that if somebody hits what requirement dead on and somebody exceeds that requirement is that
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.08 the person that exceeds that requirement it's not necessarily correlated to a higher level of
01:42:52.08 --> 01:42:57.28 performance so that's why you have to be very careful upfront about the gates you select
01:42:58.40 --> 01:43:03.28 you know Brian Decker also told a story about again you know industry experience versus none
01:43:03.28 --> 01:43:09.68 so when he was running SFAS you know sometimes we we bring civilians on and get in sort of the
01:43:09.68 --> 01:43:16.000 dog and pony they put two groups through some obstacles that special forces soldiers run through
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:23.04 in groups and again these exercises are you know the cadre are watching to see what behaviors
01:43:23.04 --> 01:43:29.36 come out from that from the individuals so it's a group of MBAs who were off the charts intelligence
01:43:29.36 --> 01:43:35.44 had industry experience were were currently getting their MBAs and then a group of undergrads
01:43:35.44 --> 01:43:42.72 you're talking 18 19 20 year olds first group of 27 to 35 year olds and you know naturally Brian
01:43:42.72 --> 01:43:47.52 Decker and his cadre you know they were shown a good time but had an assumption that the
01:43:47.52 --> 01:43:52.000 MBAs were just going to outperform the undergrads like cans down how do you think that I know
01:43:53.36 --> 01:43:59.36 the undergrads absolutely decimated every obstacle much quicker than the MBA group
01:44:00.08 --> 01:44:05.44 and it goes to to show you that you know that even though they had prior experience more vast
01:44:05.44 --> 01:44:11.44 experience those undergrads actually because they lacked ego so it's yes they lacked the group
01:44:11.44 --> 01:44:15.68 dynamic it goes to so if you have a lot of talented individuals that are humble and
01:44:15.68 --> 01:44:19.84 lackey you go when they come together it's an exponential effect one plus one isn't too
01:44:19.84 --> 01:44:26.24 with a group that truly unifies behind a common good one plus one equals three that it's an
01:44:26.24 --> 01:44:33.76 exponential effect in task unit bruiser there was a point where we were I don't know how far
01:44:33.76 --> 01:44:39.60 we were from deploying but we knew we were deploying to Iraq and one of the senior officers at the
01:44:39.60 --> 01:44:48.08 command he came to me and said hey you know you're going to Iraq do you want to switch out
01:44:48.08 --> 01:44:53.28 one of your platoons with this other platoon commander with this with this other platoon
01:44:53.28 --> 01:44:58.16 who the platoon commander has a lot more experience than your two you know your two oh I see
01:44:58.16 --> 01:45:05.04 is which was Seth and Lave and it's kind of funny because remember how the ceilings were out
01:45:05.04 --> 01:45:09.84 because they were doing construction so Seth and Lave were in the task unit bruiser office and they
01:45:09.84 --> 01:45:18.000 here this individual basically asking me if I wanted to swap out either one of these two so
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.96 Seth and Lave had very little experience they both on one deployment but they had just been
01:45:20.96 --> 01:45:25.36 in the teams for like two years and one of the platoon commanders in one of the other platoons
01:45:25.36 --> 01:45:31.28 had a lot more experience like he was a prior-in-listed guy and so the senior officer was saying hey
01:45:31.28 --> 01:45:35.36 you know you can take one you know you can take this guy and his platoon and he's got way more
01:45:35.36 --> 01:45:41.76 experience and might be a lot better for you and I was like I was like no and at this point I already knew
01:45:41.76 --> 01:45:48.08 Seth and Lave and I go um no I said these guys have exactly what I want them to have which is
01:45:48.08 --> 01:45:52.48 they're tough they're humble and they listen and that's all that's all I need that's like my
01:45:52.48 --> 01:46:02.64 most important characteristics and he was like are you sure and I was like 100% that was that.
01:46:03.68 --> 01:46:09.20 Next section the nine foundational character attributes of talent under pressure
01:46:09.20 --> 01:46:15.84 one's mental and physical limits hard skills rapidly degrade what remains is character
01:46:15.84 --> 01:46:23.60 skills are by design meant for unpredictable situations and environments says retired
01:46:23.60 --> 01:46:29.84 seal commander rich divinity if businesses are interested in forming organizations and teams that
01:46:29.84 --> 01:46:35.68 effectively deal with unpredictability and complexity they have to go deeper than the guy who has
01:46:35.68 --> 01:46:41.92 the best sales record or the Harvard grad who's at the top of the class they have to look at character
01:46:41.92 --> 01:46:48.48 characters key because it is an indicator of a person's capacity general William Boynkin points
01:46:48.48 --> 01:46:56.000 to capacity as more important than current ability quote what are you looking for hard skills
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.12 or capacity ideally look for both but if you have to choose and you have a fair way of doing so
01:47:03.12 --> 01:47:07.84 assess their capacity what is their capacity to learn new skills what is their capacity to think
01:47:07.84 --> 01:47:14.56 for themselves what is their capacity to problem solve is it interesting you're here general Boynkin
01:47:14.56 --> 01:47:19.60 like one of the priorities that he puts in there is their capacity to think for themselves not to
01:47:19.60 --> 01:47:26.32 follow rules but to think for themselves back to the book according to general Boynkin it is the
01:47:26.32 --> 01:47:31.28 focus on capacity is made special operation so successful on the battlefield and beyond a person's
01:47:31.28 --> 01:47:37.36 character is the aggregate of their deeply ingrained attributes as we define it the nine foundational
01:47:37.36 --> 01:47:44.88 character attributes of high potential individuals are drive resiliency adaptability humility integrity
01:47:44.88 --> 01:47:50.08 effective intelligence team ability curiosity and emotional strength these traits are predictors
01:47:50.08 --> 01:47:56.40 of high performance these attributes cannot be taught so they should be the focus of your hiring
01:47:58.48 --> 01:48:03.60 check and then you're going to a little spot a little section about how
01:48:03.60 --> 01:48:09.76 different special operations group sort of way those things out a little bit differently but
01:48:09.76 --> 01:48:17.04 they all are looking for the same basic the same basic things kickcare doctor care all green
01:48:17.68 --> 01:48:23.52 air force kernel psychologist he was heavily involved in the Marsoch assessment selection
01:48:24.32 --> 01:48:29.84 he set a grid he's like they're all basically looking for ice cream just different like slightly
01:48:29.84 --> 01:48:36.96 different flavors but you know the special forces guys seals Marsoch you know the Afsoch
01:48:36.96 --> 01:48:41.92 guys of PJs and CCTs they're all interchangeable we have throw them in their group the attributes
01:48:41.92 --> 01:48:47.60 are are very close totally you go into resiliency here a little bit somebody with high resiliency
01:48:47.60 --> 01:48:52.64 bounces back from stress quickly is adaptable and is not easily discouraged and individual with
01:48:52.64 --> 01:48:58.64 high resiliency resist quitting and is focused on completing goals essentially resiliency is how
01:48:58.64 --> 01:49:03.92 people handle setbacks and persevere in the face of challenges they accept failures part of the process
01:49:03.92 --> 01:49:10.72 they don't accept it passively but utilize their lessons learned and mistakes as a basis to grow
01:49:10.72 --> 01:49:18.72 and then you go into a well it's a section about a person that could be considered possibly one of
01:49:18.72 --> 01:49:23.44 the most resilient human beings in the world which is Mike Day who is just on this podcast number
01:49:23.44 --> 01:49:33.12 241 and you know shot 27 times and then killed the enemy that had shot him and just unbelievable
01:49:33.12 --> 01:49:40.96 story you put that in there you you've gone so yeah adaptability you talk about adaptability talk
01:49:40.96 --> 01:49:45.92 about humility and here we go people often asked us what is the most important trade of any leader
01:49:45.92 --> 01:49:53.44 without a doubt it's humility the US army a 244 year old institution credited with training
01:49:53.44 --> 01:49:56.96 some of our nation's most prominent leaders and practically writing the leadership manual for
01:49:56.96 --> 01:50:02.32 leaders in any field recently added humility as one of the key attributes of good leaders to the
01:50:02.32 --> 01:50:08.40 army doctrine publication six tack 22 saying a leader with the right level of humility is a
01:50:08.40 --> 01:50:13.84 willing learner maintains accurate self awareness and seeks out others input and feedback
01:50:13.84 --> 01:50:22.40 and this is something that one day on our echelon front ops call I said hey I've got something to
01:50:22.40 --> 01:50:26.48 tell everyone in this group we've been talking about humility as the most important characteristic
01:50:26.48 --> 01:50:32.64 for a leader for the past 13 years or whatever was 12 years at the time and the army just added
01:50:32.64 --> 01:50:36.16 this to their manual which is freaking awesome because those characters extend and changed for a
01:50:36.16 --> 01:50:42.72 long long time in the army but they realized if you're not humble you got problems I just want to say
01:50:42.72 --> 01:50:47.68 plagiarism is one of the high forms of flattery so if you bring your lawyers at me we will go
01:50:47.68 --> 01:50:54.000 to tell a lot of this is taken from my mentors I did not credit you in certain spots
01:50:55.76 --> 01:51:01.60 it goes back to Johnny and I think the military as a whole there was a point where we viewed
01:51:01.60 --> 01:51:09.60 humility as weakness and I think at a young age I miss took somebody like Johnny who's just one of
01:51:09.60 --> 01:51:18.80 the most humble dudes he still is as a slight form of weakness it's funny that the army I think
01:51:18.80 --> 01:51:24.32 sort of has morphed as well their their view on that the criticality of humility
01:51:25.36 --> 01:51:30.24 yeah no no doubt about it and you also realize after you know you've realized
01:51:31.76 --> 01:51:35.68 the thing that pointed this out to me strong did anything else was when we were fire a guy
01:51:35.68 --> 01:51:40.88 that was going through my training we would be firing that person if they want a leadership position
01:51:40.88 --> 01:51:44.88 if they want a leadership position they could get fired for safety or a number of anything
01:51:44.88 --> 01:51:49.44 any other things but if they were getting fired from a leadership position they were generally
01:51:49.44 --> 01:51:53.36 having safety problems they weren't having they knew how to shoot their gun they were in good
01:51:53.36 --> 01:51:57.44 physical condition they were getting fired because they lack humility which meant they weren't
01:51:57.44 --> 01:52:00.32 listening to anybody else they weren't listening to the critique from their own
01:52:00.32 --> 01:52:03.84 platoon they weren't listening to advice from their platoon chief or from their task in the
01:52:03.84 --> 01:52:07.92 corner anyone else I definitely not the freaking training contract so they're just a disaster
01:52:09.76 --> 01:52:16.32 and I have to bring up a comment a youtube comment okay so the Johnny Kim podcast
01:52:17.04 --> 01:52:21.52 on youtube and it says something like you know the title of the podcast is
01:52:21.52 --> 01:52:33.92 Johnny Kim you know seal sniper harver doctor astronaut and the first comment on youtube is
01:52:34.88 --> 01:52:40.08 dude can't hold a job which I thought was pretty funny
01:52:43.20 --> 01:52:48.40 integrity you guys talk about integrity I mean these you go through these characteristics kind of
01:52:48.40 --> 01:52:53.84 each one effective intelligence talks to me about effective intelligence what was effective
01:52:53.84 --> 01:52:59.52 intelligence compared to just plain old intelligence and I hope this has something to do with the fact
01:52:59.52 --> 01:53:07.68 that speaking of acquiring people there was a time in the late 90s where in the seal teams in the
01:53:07.68 --> 01:53:13.36 officer community I wasn't an officer yet but they were the seals were starting to get popular
01:53:13.36 --> 01:53:20.40 and they started getting really good candidates for the officer program and so they started recruiting
01:53:20.40 --> 01:53:27.20 and beyond just recruiting they started accepting all these just Ivy League Ivy League
01:53:27.20 --> 01:53:32.40 individuals you meet every every every new group of officers that we show up the seal team
01:53:33.28 --> 01:53:37.68 you know there'd be a bunch of enable academy guys because they get a bunch of the billets every year
01:53:37.68 --> 01:53:44.000 and then there'd be a bunch of guys from freaking harvered and and jail and these really smart guys and
01:53:46.64 --> 01:53:50.32 maybe they didn't have and I'm not saying this about every because some of them were great guys
01:53:50.32 --> 01:53:55.20 but not all of them have what I'm hoping is referred to in this book as effective intelligence
01:53:55.20 --> 01:54:00.48 is that someone accurate it is I'm gonna take one step back so integrity I know we sort of
01:54:00.48 --> 01:54:05.84 glossed over that Josh cotton doctor cotton is very passionate about this one he's done a lot of
01:54:05.84 --> 01:54:12.08 studies and look at the data organizations that are in you know high ethics or highly you know
01:54:12.08 --> 01:54:19.28 high in integrity the culture is much healthier than organizations that don't and I know that's
01:54:19.28 --> 01:54:26.32 sort of an obvious statement but you look at Enron yeah and I think also you you you say it seems like
01:54:26.32 --> 01:54:31.52 an obvious statement and yet there's so many organizations that let those things slide and here's
01:54:31.52 --> 01:54:37.36 the problem with letting things slide when it comes to integrity once this is you know this slippery
01:54:37.36 --> 01:54:42.08 slope sometimes they say a slippery slope fallacy because you know well just because I did this
01:54:42.08 --> 01:54:46.88 doesn't really mean I'm gonna do that the slippery slope when it comes to integrity is I think
01:54:46.88 --> 01:54:53.52 is almost unstoppable thing because you know if I let echo get away with something well now he's got
01:54:53.52 --> 01:54:58.80 something on me and now he lets me get away with something we go back and forth we go on this downward
01:54:58.80 --> 01:55:05.84 spiral and there's no one that can I once I once I give up my integrity I give up my ability to
01:55:05.84 --> 01:55:11.60 tighten anyone else's integrity up and you've also said a new standard you've put your personal
01:55:11.60 --> 01:55:17.52 stamp on approval the that behavior is now tolerated yep and you that's what makes it so hard you can't
01:55:17.52 --> 01:55:22.88 go backwards yeah you can't unring that bell it's really hard to do with all and if you have to go backwards
01:55:22.88 --> 01:55:27.76 because look you can put yourself in a situation what do you do you own it you stand up in front of
01:55:27.76 --> 01:55:31.52 the troops you say hey look I made a bad decision this is a bad personal decision I thought this
01:55:31.52 --> 01:55:36.16 was a good thing to do it didn't make sense it was the wrong thing I won't let it happen again
01:55:36.16 --> 01:55:40.56 that might be you know that's your that's your first step in trying to recover your integrity
01:55:40.56 --> 01:55:47.04 yeah but when you give it up that's why it's so you know the moral high ground the moral high ground
01:55:47.04 --> 01:55:52.16 and keeping the high ground it's talked about this the other day on EF online it's like
01:55:52.16 --> 01:55:59.76 once you give up the moral high ground it's just like being in combat you now you now are going
01:55:59.76 --> 01:56:04.80 to have to fight to get it back and it's a freaking uphill battle and there's a good chance
01:56:04.80 --> 01:56:11.76 you can't get up there anymore so you cannot give up that moral and ethical high ground it just
01:56:11.76 --> 01:56:15.84 it's it's one of the worst possible moves you can make on the battlefield and it's one of the
01:56:15.84 --> 01:56:20.24 worst possible moves you can make in life so I didn't mean to breeze over integrity like that
01:56:20.24 --> 01:56:26.64 but no doubt it's a it's a core component of what you got to be looking for in people
01:56:26.64 --> 01:56:31.60 and people don't scream for it that's the weirdest thing nobody ever asked the
01:56:31.60 --> 01:56:36.48 well I should say nobody I want to be careful on extremes there but I've watched you know
01:56:36.48 --> 01:56:40.32 the predominance of the hiring I do I manage a team but most of the hiring that I'm looking
01:56:40.32 --> 01:56:43.84 after is executive level and you know all of these offers come by and you're talking
01:56:43.84 --> 01:56:49.52 half million cash and more I mean they're their significant compensation and I don't
01:56:49.52 --> 01:56:56.80 hear anybody ask the question can you give me an example of when you had the hold the line on
01:56:56.80 --> 01:57:03.12 integrity and take the harder path even just that simple question you won't hear it in an
01:57:03.12 --> 01:57:09.12 interview process it would it would shock me if I heard it but it is so fundamental if you don't
01:57:09.12 --> 01:57:15.76 have this the rest doesn't matter if there's if the integrity's gone that's it you you cannot
01:57:15.76 --> 01:57:20.000 have a person without integrity in your organization full stop what was interesting is we were
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.92 writing this book as so calm was dealing with a number of ethical issues and let's be asked a
01:57:25.92 --> 01:57:31.60 lot of them were coming from the CO community and you know we we sort of struggled hey do we have
01:57:31.60 --> 01:57:36.24 to change in the language in here but you know one individual doesn't speak for the organization
01:57:37.04 --> 01:57:42.08 but they do when they're on the front lines or front pages front page they speak for your
01:57:42.08 --> 01:57:49.12 organization and you know you mentioned Ivy League and and I feel bad sometimes because I overindex
01:57:49.12 --> 01:57:54.16 on Ivy League guys and sometimes I'm critical there there were some great CO officers that came out
01:57:54.16 --> 01:58:00.64 for certainly for sure some outstanding guys no doubt but they were more the exception than the
01:58:00.64 --> 01:58:08.88 the norm so as I'm talking to Johnny Kim Johnny was like speaking Harvard that was after he
01:58:08.88 --> 01:58:13.60 became a CEO so he gets a he gets a pass and and Johnny brought up a story in my life where I'm
01:58:13.60 --> 01:58:18.08 like Johnny that's that's not a good story so you know we're talking about buzz we're talking
01:58:18.08 --> 01:58:21.36 about Ryan and him and I or you know you could tell we're getting a little emotional on the phone
01:58:21.36 --> 01:58:28.56 he's like hey you remember that time we had a Harvard officer in our Buds class who actually
01:58:28.56 --> 01:58:34.08 worked for N-Ron but some officer you know I don't know what what what what the fascination was it like
01:58:34.08 --> 01:58:40.80 all this guy went to Harvard news with that run and you know in these in Buds and um this guy was
01:58:41.84 --> 01:58:48.64 arguably one of the smartest guys in the class now as part of Johnny um and he said that's nice
01:58:48.64 --> 01:58:57.44 this guy just alienated everyone he thought he was the smartest man in the room and he was
01:58:57.44 --> 01:59:03.92 egotistical he was an a-hole and Johnny's like so he's done the story about we're running to the
01:59:03.92 --> 01:59:11.04 chowhole and still there's like 250 to 125 people in the class in this guy knew I was a recon Marine
01:59:11.04 --> 01:59:17.04 and you know sometimes you'll run the formation there's one guy that runs to the right of the
01:59:17.04 --> 01:59:22.08 is it the left of the left left this is my yeah for marine that's pretty embarrassing so we're
01:59:22.08 --> 01:59:26.96 gonna do the left but his hands up the wall and makes an elder left one and he's singing cadence
01:59:26.96 --> 01:59:32.08 and he's just ripping on recon and Johnny's laughing on the phone because the whole class saw
01:59:32.08 --> 01:59:37.60 this guy just fall out of the main formation run out and I just took a hand you know sort of the
01:59:37.60 --> 01:59:43.28 night not the night hand but the hard hand was there over not to slap not to helmet right off his uh
01:59:43.28 --> 01:59:46.32 his head and he goes wrong across the street and he has to run over and I just took over the
01:59:46.32 --> 01:59:52.88 cadence and I'm like Johnny that was not my best man but this guy I kind of liked that moment this
01:59:52.88 --> 01:59:59.52 guy was uh he was gonna make it through a hurry he was gonna meet the physical requirements
01:59:59.52 --> 02:00:04.72 in the mental toughness requirements but the cotter a stepped in and dropped him and that's rare
02:00:05.44 --> 02:00:13.04 because he was just that toxic it that toxic and it's funny that the instructors could recognize
02:00:13.04 --> 02:00:16.72 that because usually instructors like hey he meets all these requirements we can breathe that out of them
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:25.04 effective intelligence is the ability to use the intelligence you have in a real world setting
02:00:25.04 --> 02:00:31.84 to solve problems for which there is no playbook and that is the heart of special operations
02:00:32.24 --> 02:00:36.96 so there you know we found a study what would you guess it was the average GPA of most
02:00:36.96 --> 02:00:44.24 millionaires that went to college I have no idea 2.9 2.9 and that's my seven graces because I think
02:00:44.24 --> 02:00:51.92 I got a 2.9 on it so I'm like hey Abby so what we found in the people that are off the charts
02:00:51.92 --> 02:00:55.76 smart and what we saw in the seal teams is that they suffered a lot from the process through
02:00:55.76 --> 02:01:02.24 analysis or they made things so overly complex and when you work in high-staking environments
02:01:02.24 --> 02:01:10.72 time is usually a factor and it goes back to the second law of combat simple yeah that's that's
02:01:10.72 --> 02:01:17.04 all good stuff and again hey we're not bagging on the guys that came in and had awesome education
02:01:17.04 --> 02:01:21.12 and a lot of them were awesome and and here's another another reason that it hurt the community
02:01:21.12 --> 02:01:25.44 was because these guys would be coming in and they were had such high potential this is in the
02:01:25.44 --> 02:01:30.48 90s there's no war going on they do four years they get they do their system of
02:01:30.48 --> 02:01:34.56 two commander they do their putton commander they look at what's ahead of them in the 90s and it was like oh
02:01:34.56 --> 02:01:39.44 you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you know ride a desk for the next 18 or whatever the
02:01:39.44 --> 02:01:42.96 next 16 years before you can retire and guys would say you know I'm gonna get out and I'm gonna go
02:01:43.52 --> 02:01:48.40 do do something else so it hurt us from a just a personnel building standpoint as well
02:01:49.04 --> 02:01:52.32 but that's uh the other thing that I've seen is where you get
02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.32 and look some people pull this off and they do it great but there are some people that have a problem
02:01:58.32 --> 02:02:06.16 taking their highly intellectual view of something and translating it to the frontline troops
02:02:06.16 --> 02:02:10.96 where now the people the people that have to go and execute whatever did you want them to execute
02:02:11.52 --> 02:02:15.52 is doing it in a simple clear concise right that's why simple is one of the laws of combat
02:02:16.08 --> 02:02:20.24 but you know part of the law of combat is planning keep your your planning simple the other
02:02:20.24 --> 02:02:24.72 part of that law of combat is to communicate simply and there's a lot of people that have a hard time
02:02:24.72 --> 02:02:29.44 doing not a lot there are some people that have a hard time doing that so that's a
02:02:30.32 --> 02:02:35.60 that effective intelligence is uh is definitely an important thing and that is the one I mean
02:02:35.60 --> 02:02:40.56 one of the attributes specific to Marsauk is that they called it effective intelligence and that's you know
02:02:40.56 --> 02:02:46.000 again flint we we we took that one it was the way they described it in their assessment and
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.08 selection manual that that's one of their primary requirements the way they described it was absolutely
02:02:50.08 --> 02:02:57.92 beautiful. Marsauk had the advantage of having joined so calm late you know I was a recon marine
02:02:57.92 --> 02:03:03.60 we were never part of so calm back then and eventually 2000 was at five six Marsauk that one
02:03:03.60 --> 02:03:08.24 led by Colonel Kaczynski two 2004 yeah because they were leave me and Baghdad that's right
02:03:08.24 --> 02:03:14.80 and everyone's like yeah this is a no-brainer but they could look when they were building the Marsauk
02:03:14.80 --> 02:03:19.44 assessment selection course they could look at what the sealer and the SF community and they were very
02:03:19.44 --> 02:03:23.52 deliberate and that's the Marsauk community stand by they're they're they're just going to be
02:03:23.52 --> 02:03:29.52 powerful they already are yeah you know we were talking about to bring this over to the business world
02:03:29.52 --> 02:03:36.000 you know we talk about effective intelligence and people over indexing on experience they're
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:43.04 wanting people to come and take a playbook and run it over here and and assuming that the situations
02:03:43.04 --> 02:03:48.80 that you're going to find in this particular business are going to be exactly the same and so
02:03:48.80 --> 02:03:53.20 they're thinking well they've handled these situations over here they'll be able to handle them here
02:03:53.20 --> 02:04:00.88 will be successful in the story it's the effective intelligence that's not assuming any course of action
02:04:01.44 --> 02:04:07.68 for a business problem they're looking at it that that ability to take the intellectual horsepower
02:04:07.68 --> 02:04:12.88 and look at all of the data points all of the indicators all of the little pieces of intel
02:04:12.88 --> 02:04:21.12 collect them and put them into a cohesive picture that then you explain simply with the plan of attack
02:04:21.76 --> 02:04:27.36 and it's so different than experience and if we can get people to index on that versus the experience
02:04:28.16 --> 02:04:31.84 you see the difference immediately you know George we actually we talk about the 70%
02:04:31.84 --> 02:04:36.96 solution that's a great example what you're you're explaining in a business context is again
02:04:36.96 --> 02:04:41.76 the guys that are wildly intelligent when they only have 70% of the operational picture they can't
02:04:41.76 --> 02:04:50.40 make a decision but people high in high effective intelligence can draw threads parallels and make a
02:04:50.40 --> 02:04:54.80 very decisive decision with interplayed information and you know they we pulled a quote out
02:04:54.80 --> 02:04:59.28 because we're talking to Tracy Kio and so she was talking about the CEO of Microsoft
02:04:59.28 --> 02:05:07.36 said we don't want no adults we want learn adults if you can get that how far ahead of the game are you
02:05:07.36 --> 02:05:13.60 I'm gonna I'm gonna reach into some people's brains that are listening to this right now
02:05:13.60 --> 02:05:18.72 and I'm just gonna do a little a little tweak on their brains because I promise you I promise you
02:05:18.72 --> 02:05:25.28 that there's some people that when you said hey you're talking about someone that just takes a playbook
02:05:25.28 --> 02:05:30.48 and runs the playbook and that's it I promise you that there's some people that are thinking wait that's
02:05:30.48 --> 02:05:33.60 what I want that's what I want right there I want someone who's gonna take that playbook and they're
02:05:33.60 --> 02:05:38.16 gonna run that's what they're gonna do and and I'm gonna reach in there and just I have to stop you
02:05:38.16 --> 02:05:43.68 from thinking that because I know that's what you think you want that's what that's what leaders think
02:05:43.68 --> 02:05:47.68 they think hey look I've got this all figured out if everyone would just do what I tell them to do
02:05:47.68 --> 02:05:53.92 run the playbook just do what I say to do will be good to go here's the thing there's no static
02:05:53.92 --> 02:06:04.24 function in the world that what you want is non-thinking apparatus to run a playbook and if you do
02:06:04.24 --> 02:06:08.96 if you have something like that yes automate that get a robot to do that task and do them
02:06:08.96 --> 02:06:13.92 over and over again the same way when you're hiding a leader you want them to be able to adapt
02:06:13.92 --> 02:06:19.60 and change and make improvements and do whatever they have to do to win that's what you want so if you
02:06:19.60 --> 02:06:26.08 hear George say hey we don't want someone that's just gonna run the playbook and you're thinking
02:06:26.08 --> 02:06:31.36 no way I do that do want that no you don't and this was the same thing is happen to the
02:06:31.36 --> 02:06:36.32 micro managers coming through my train when I was running training you get someone that's thinking hey
02:06:36.32 --> 02:06:41.44 look I've been I'm either I'm experienced or I know I'm highly educated I know how to run these
02:06:41.44 --> 02:06:45.28 operations so everyone if everyone just get in line and just do what I tell them to do will be
02:06:45.28 --> 02:06:49.76 good to go and what is that turned into it's micro management that you can't tell everyone what to do
02:06:49.76 --> 02:06:53.52 there's no way you can be everywhere or once and everything falls apart you need thinking shooters
02:06:53.52 --> 02:07:01.28 is what we used to call it so what what we're offering at at EF Overwatch is thinking leaders that will
02:07:01.28 --> 02:07:06.96 actually solve problems yeah you're right and and you know we made a little vignette a little video about this
02:07:08.16 --> 02:07:13.28 but coming up through the army and you know joccal I was actually one of those people that
02:07:13.28 --> 02:07:18.56 started to get out in the 90s I was I'd gotten through you know I had two years of line command
02:07:18.56 --> 02:07:23.60 and I'm thinking I love this I got to go to field I love being with my soldiers and then you
02:07:23.60 --> 02:07:27.04 didn't you know your time for a command comes up in the army and you're looking ahead and you're going
02:07:27.92 --> 02:07:31.76 now I'm gonna say something and I don't want to hear crap about it later Mike but I'm thinking
02:07:31.76 --> 02:07:37.44 I got a life of Harvard graphics ahead of me which preceded powerpoint just to bring you along
02:07:37.44 --> 02:07:48.000 with the program here but and and so I got out but I have to tell you the US army and the US military
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:55.52 is the world's greatest leadership incubator and I owe so much back to the military to my mentors
02:07:55.52 --> 02:08:00.48 to my coaches to the soldiers to the non-commissioned officers people I served with and it created
02:08:00.48 --> 02:08:08.96 and made that thinking leader do I have all the answers no no but that the US military when we
02:08:08.96 --> 02:08:15.28 talk about it yet folks we talk about placing leaders it's you're in a fishbowl 247 365 is a
02:08:15.28 --> 02:08:21.20 leader it is the biggest and best burden you can ever carry is to be a leader in the United States
02:08:21.20 --> 02:08:26.96 military it is just it's an honor a privilege it's scariest how it's rewarding is how it's everything
02:08:26.96 --> 02:08:34.64 but you're in an incubator to lead and and I am so so grateful for that and and so when we talk
02:08:34.64 --> 02:08:39.68 about the principles in these book and when we talk about that effective intelligence the army
02:08:39.68 --> 02:08:45.04 helped me in my case deliver that that that did I know everything about the enemy no I had to take all
02:08:45.04 --> 02:08:49.20 these cues and start putting pieces together what do I have to do what are my possible courses
02:08:49.20 --> 02:08:56.16 of action what's good what's bad what's high risk what's low risk and anyway it just it is it is
02:08:56.16 --> 02:09:01.52 astounded me how much I learned to think about the art of leadership coming through the US military
02:09:02.48 --> 02:09:08.64 I mean muskets were not as intuitive during his days as you know for us we have now but we had good
02:09:08.64 --> 02:09:12.80 horses like so you know I'm good with that this is what I have to put up with daily
02:09:12.80 --> 02:09:20.96 team ability did you guys make up that work that hyphenated work team ability we did not
02:09:21.60 --> 02:09:28.000 we I think we found that within our research we we we liked it so we we stuck with yeah kind of
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.56 because we were talking with Brian Decker we were talking a lot of people
02:09:31.60 --> 02:09:36.40 that you everybody had different versions of that same word so we put that together yeah the
02:09:36.40 --> 02:09:42.24 team work and how different and do you have the ability to put yourself whatever level you're at
02:09:43.12 --> 02:09:47.44 as a team player and that there's a certain element of that to be a follower as well
02:09:47.44 --> 02:09:51.68 what do we put everything like that word yeah okay yeah we came up with it
02:09:51.68 --> 02:09:57.52 good ago you say about nothing worth accomplishing it can be done alone there are no
02:09:57.52 --> 02:10:01.36 rampos in the military that might look cool in the movies but individual is die pretty quickly on
02:10:01.36 --> 02:10:06.88 the battlefield or worst get others hurt they're great success requires that we work together
02:10:07.52 --> 02:10:12.64 curiosity exploring the unknown and questioning the status quo and pursue to better
02:10:12.64 --> 02:10:17.52 more effective solutions is the key to innovation without curious individuals nothing would ever
02:10:17.52 --> 02:10:25.92 change or improve emotional strength in the US military and I'm given like these highly abbreviated
02:10:25.92 --> 02:10:32.000 definitions and you guys go into it not not only do you go into better examples but then not only
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.52 not only more detailed definitions but examples you know you're talking about the rescue
02:10:37.52 --> 02:10:42.48 cap and films I mean you got really cool examples in here to back these things up but that's
02:10:42.48 --> 02:10:47.52 where people buy the books so that they can read those curiosity already covered that emotional strength
02:10:48.16 --> 02:10:54.88 in the US military the whole man concept is the belief that the individuals need to be assessed
02:10:54.88 --> 02:11:00.24 based on the entirety of their person mental physical and emotional and emotionally strong individual
02:11:00.24 --> 02:11:06.80 has a positive attitude high empathy and emotional control in stressful situations many of the
02:11:06.80 --> 02:11:12.56 individuals we interviewed identified positive attitude as important to their hiring decisions
02:11:12.56 --> 02:11:18.64 attitude is contagious positivity breeds positivity while negativity
02:11:18.64 --> 02:11:24.80 be gets more negativity an individual the negative attitude can still produce results but is often at the expense
02:11:24.80 --> 02:11:31.04 of company culture typically that one person who's also not worth the resulting damage to the team
02:11:33.76 --> 02:11:38.88 you have highlighted this section emotional strength is the ability to regulate ones emotions
02:11:38.88 --> 02:11:44.64 to remain logical under stress situations marsawk calls this stress tolerance and defines it as
02:11:44.64 --> 02:11:50.000 the ability to deal with ambiguous dangerous high pressure or frustrating events while maintaining control
02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:56.32 of emotions actions composure and effectiveness it is a universal truth in life that humans don't
02:11:56.32 --> 02:12:01.52 make good decisions in emotional state people who are able to remain cool calm and collected in the
02:12:01.52 --> 02:12:06.40 face of challenges and the unknown are people you want in your organization this is the exact reason
02:12:06.40 --> 02:12:11.20 soft creates stressful environments to mimic the conditions of war during assessment and selection
02:12:11.20 --> 02:12:16.16 programs stress tolerance is so important that some soft organizations even use heart rate
02:12:16.16 --> 02:12:23.92 monitors to evaluate individuals psychological physiological responses to stress
02:12:26.96 --> 02:12:33.76 got to stay calm got to be able to detach these were this chapter I mean you get people that
02:12:33.76 --> 02:12:37.68 are very passionate Ryan Decker was heavily involved in this chapter rich divinity
02:12:37.68 --> 02:12:44.40 geverserved with rich I did not rich is a brother very very passionate about in fact he has a book
02:12:44.40 --> 02:12:50.000 called the attributes 25 hidden drivers of optimal performance it's about attributes some of his
02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.40 observations like empathy you know when you think about it in the way he described it he said
02:12:55.04 --> 02:13:01.04 special operations is very good about dialing up and dialing down empathy he said it's almost like
02:13:01.04 --> 02:13:06.24 a dimmer switch when you go out on an operation in your right in the home there's a likelihood
02:13:06.24 --> 02:13:10.88 that there are women and children in there and you know you've got a dial down or empathy to
02:13:10.88 --> 02:13:15.76 accomplish the mission not you know safeguard them while while still bringing the hurt to the
02:13:15.76 --> 02:13:20.24 the combatants you're known after um yet we're very good about down that empathy back up when we
02:13:20.24 --> 02:13:27.92 come back from from from uh operations so um very detailed conversations very passionate about these
02:13:27.92 --> 02:13:34.72 these subjects and um those two were instrumental in uh in the chapter yeah you guys dug into
02:13:34.72 --> 02:13:40.56 some like I said good stuff and obviously going with getting those dead information for good people
02:13:42.96 --> 02:13:52.80 creating a talent acquisition plan talk to me about that well you know one of the many
02:13:52.80 --> 02:13:58.40 mistakes that you know once you get past you know making sure that your chief human resources
02:13:58.40 --> 02:14:04.64 chief human resource officer is strategic and tied into your CEO you have to look
02:14:04.64 --> 02:14:13.52 ahead you know at that old adage if you if you fail to plan you're planning to fail people look
02:14:13.52 --> 02:14:18.88 at talent and recruiting and staffing is hey we've got these open positions let's crank it there's
02:14:18.88 --> 02:14:25.20 not often a plan behind it and that starts with looking at your company and it starts with going okay
02:14:25.20 --> 02:14:31.12 what is the strength of our company when it comes to talent what gaps do we have what gaps do we
02:14:31.12 --> 02:14:35.76 have in leadership what gaps do we have in technology what gaps do we have in sales in leaders
02:14:35.76 --> 02:14:41.36 in individual contributors do we have key points of failure do we have only one person that can do
02:14:41.36 --> 02:14:46.72 this job and if they go we've nobody to step up do we have number two do we have number three
02:14:47.28 --> 02:14:52.80 okay where are we gonna grow where are we gonna grow next year and you know this could go on and on
02:14:52.80 --> 02:14:58.32 and on but the basics are is you need to be sitting down and looking at each organization and what
02:14:58.32 --> 02:15:03.92 are you missing why are you winning in that department why are you winning in sales why are you winning
02:15:03.92 --> 02:15:08.40 in product why are you winning in service or whatever and find out what your gaps are and that's
02:15:08.40 --> 02:15:14.000 where you start with talent and get that down into a plan that says okay we're gonna go after this
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.60 in a strategic way we are gonna go out into the market you know we're gonna look within our own
02:15:19.60 --> 02:15:23.92 organization first but then we're gonna go out to the market and we're gonna build an organization
02:15:23.92 --> 02:15:29.76 in talent acquisition HR that says these are the people that are the gatekeepers and they are
02:15:29.76 --> 02:15:34.32 going to find and they are gonna know what our success profiles look like and they are gonna
02:15:34.32 --> 02:15:40.48 bring us high caliber people with those character attributes to be considered for these positions
02:15:40.48 --> 02:15:46.24 but you plan it out first is going oh you know what hey we have an open position over here you
02:15:46.24 --> 02:15:51.20 know we've authorized 10 head count in this particular department you've got an empty seat what
02:15:51.20 --> 02:15:55.44 do you need that's not a plan that's just that's a button to see like we talked about
02:15:56.40 --> 02:16:02.64 you you have to take that time to say what does my organization look like as far as talent and people
02:16:02.64 --> 02:16:06.48 it's one of the many things that because everybody's focused on everything else they don't take the
02:16:06.48 --> 02:16:13.04 time to go what's gonna bring us into 21 what's gonna bring us into 22 you and like Don Roberts
02:16:13.04 --> 02:16:17.84 and said in our book you have to be higher for the skills and needs of the future where your company
02:16:17.84 --> 02:16:22.24 is gonna go and I think we even brought it up it's like the term is fighting in the last war
02:16:23.04 --> 02:16:26.96 you know you're not thinking ahead is to what you're gonna need and so there's no plan to go
02:16:26.96 --> 02:16:32.16 after that and build that for the future this is one of those things where you it happens to
02:16:32.16 --> 02:16:37.12 echelon front sometimes be working with a company and and you know they're whatever company is
02:16:37.12 --> 02:16:40.32 it happens all the time companies caught up in that firefight day to day they're trying to survive
02:16:40.32 --> 02:16:44.32 they're trying to make things happen they got projects do they got all the things going on and then
02:16:44.32 --> 02:16:49.20 you know you ask them about you know hey do you do you have anyone that's looking at you know
02:16:50.16 --> 02:16:54.24 six months down the line about where you're gonna be about what supplies you're gonna need or whatever
02:16:54.24 --> 02:16:59.12 just whatever those and and you can see their caught their caught like on their heels because they don't
02:16:59.92 --> 02:17:05.52 and if you if you think about what you're talking about here a talent acquisition plan how we're
02:17:05.52 --> 02:17:10.64 actually going to build a company and you think about how many companies are out there
02:17:10.64 --> 02:17:17.36 that the way they think about is just it's a fire fight right we need to fill this seat right now
02:17:17.36 --> 02:17:22.40 that's the plan the plan is hire someone to do that role next week we have a new plan the plan is
02:17:22.40 --> 02:17:27.28 hire someone to keep fill this other role yep there's no unified long-term strategic plan of what we're
02:17:27.28 --> 02:17:32.000 doing and what is the military do better than well there's many things they do better than most
02:17:32.96 --> 02:17:38.32 there's always a pipeline there's always a pipeline there's always a plan there's a succession plan
02:17:38.32 --> 02:17:44.96 there is a pipeline of high quality people coming into a pipeline so we can assess and select and put them into
02:17:44.96 --> 02:17:50.88 those things it's it's a forethought we have people that are out there doing that stuff but they're actually
02:17:50.88 --> 02:17:57.84 thinking what do we need for 21 22 23 24 25 won't even that goes all the way out the systems in equipment
02:17:58.88 --> 02:18:04.40 and but the military does it all whereas corporations will go to your point they're out there firefighting
02:18:04.40 --> 02:18:09.28 oh wow wow I've got an opening on team I got to bring somebody in but if you do have an opening on
02:18:09.28 --> 02:18:13.04 your team it should be hey we got a pipeline already talent that's banging out the door to get
02:18:13.04 --> 02:18:18.40 into this place because we have a talent mindset we have leadership we are focused we empower our
02:18:18.40 --> 02:18:23.76 people we lead our people we drive our people we win and people will want to be a part of that
02:18:23.76 --> 02:18:28.96 yeah you guys break it down and hear what you have to do what you have to do to create this
02:18:28.96 --> 02:18:33.12 talent acquisition plan defining greatness in your organization identify your high performance
02:18:33.12 --> 02:18:39.12 as a session talent objective assessments just you guys go line by line and explain all these things
02:18:39.12 --> 02:18:44.24 in great detail build your talent profiles mic you already mentioned that workforce plan I mean you
02:18:44.24 --> 02:18:50.64 just go through the detail so that people that don't have a plan can actually open up this book
02:18:51.20 --> 02:18:57.84 and put a plan together so that they're moving forward with a route right with a route instead
02:18:57.84 --> 02:19:03.92 of just moving forward in the blind which is crazy to think about and yet it happens all the time it's
02:19:03.92 --> 02:19:10.32 just start with the conversation the senior leaders and companies are not having this conversation
02:19:10.32 --> 02:19:14.96 and that's where it starts there's many ways to go about this you don't need to bring you know
02:19:14.96 --> 02:19:18.80 bring in a top five consulting firm yes you can bring in the info for watching that's my plug
02:19:19.52 --> 02:19:23.84 but you know this this isn't something where you're going to bring in you know industrial
02:19:23.84 --> 02:19:27.76 organizational psychologists and you're going to create assessments that are going to solve this for you
02:19:27.76 --> 02:19:32.64 this is this is this is basic leadership that you have to have the discipline to fall through on
02:19:32.64 --> 02:19:37.36 and you can create these processes from scratch special operations community how to start somewhere
02:19:37.36 --> 02:19:41.36 they basically started from scratch and you can build this it's going to take time
02:19:41.36 --> 02:19:45.12 but you have to have those conversations and you have to have those conversations all the time
02:19:45.12 --> 02:19:51.44 every every week every month are we selecting not only for what we need now but five years
02:19:51.44 --> 02:19:56.72 don't mind if you're creating a town profile how does that top profile change with the digital
02:19:56.72 --> 02:20:01.12 transformation five years from now what's going to be required in terms of attributes five years
02:20:01.12 --> 02:20:12.96 down the road or ten years down the road? Next section is about attracting top talent what talented
02:20:12.96 --> 02:20:18.000 people look for attracting talent requires knowing what talented people want many companies assume
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.76 that the answer is money and perks they offer competitive salaries and wonderful
02:20:21.76 --> 02:20:26.88 creature comforts high end expression machines fully stocked kitchens pool tables and more
02:20:27.76 --> 02:20:32.72 and yet they still have rich talent on the other end we've seen countless people turn down
02:20:32.72 --> 02:20:37.84 higher pay to stay with the company where they feel challenged and love the people they work with
02:20:37.84 --> 02:20:43.44 if you want people to dedicate their talents to your company you must offer something equally
02:20:43.44 --> 02:20:48.88 valuable in return since talented people have high drive they are interested they're just as
02:20:48.88 --> 02:20:54.16 interested in achievement and challenge as money let's not fool ourselves if your compensation
02:20:54.16 --> 02:20:58.96 benefits are not competitive within your industry you'll lose out on talent but attracting top
02:20:58.96 --> 02:21:03.92 people goes beyond that beyond money talented people look for talented leaders and colleagues
02:21:03.92 --> 02:21:09.60 a sense of community a challenge opportunities for professional and personal growth and purpose
02:21:09.60 --> 02:21:17.04 talent attracts talent it's a magnet good leaders or you want to go even in my military career
02:21:17.60 --> 02:21:21.92 I know who those good leaders are and I'm like oh I got to get that organization because they're
02:21:21.92 --> 02:21:25.68 going to help me get to the next level they're going to pass on that experience that coaching the
02:21:25.68 --> 02:21:29.84 mentorship I did that in the military I do it here in the corporate world I've been doing it for
02:21:29.84 --> 02:21:34.48 20 years you know one of the people in this book I actually followed to another organization he's like hey
02:21:34.48 --> 02:21:39.04 hey I'm like I'm there I'm there you know he goes do you want to talk about the
02:21:39.04 --> 02:21:47.28 compensation I said no let's just move let's go and the great part is is that you know there's
02:21:47.28 --> 02:21:54.24 a lot of bad habits that get you into a vicious cycle but attracting great talent gets you into a
02:21:54.24 --> 02:22:02.32 positive cycle of attracting better talent all the time you're alumni in the people currently
02:22:02.32 --> 02:22:09.52 in your organization are the best way to attract talent hands down I mean you're doing it right now
02:22:09.52 --> 02:22:17.44 you've probably caused a lot of young men and women to in list or seek missions in the military
02:22:17.44 --> 02:22:22.16 based off the lessons that are learning but yes that is a factual statement there we go there's a lot
02:22:22.16 --> 02:22:28.16 of a lot of people out there that are straight up in the military from listening to podcast
02:22:28.16 --> 02:22:32.40 because I hear from all the time it's awesome in fact we're having dinner last night Air Force
02:22:32.40 --> 02:22:38.000 individual came up and said hey I follow everything you do thank you for what you do and then he
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:44.40 asks he handed me the phone said hey can you take a picture of Jack and I might say really he's like yeah
02:22:44.40 --> 02:22:51.52 okay so you tell the story and this is a hundred percent true I didn't come from the military
02:22:51.52 --> 02:22:58.56 lineage I didn't I'd seen the movies that they were pretty cool I thought the military was potentially a
02:22:59.36 --> 02:23:05.60 path for me there was multiple paths the backup dancer from Madonna was just not going to be a
02:23:05.60 --> 02:23:11.68 career that provided you know what I needed to live so I wouldn't know that it inside Joe it's
02:23:11.68 --> 02:23:23.52 it's also frightening mental image I assure you there's a sequence on somewhere in his house so
02:23:23.52 --> 02:23:30.16 18 and living in Colorado I ran into I'm not gonna mention his name which is called staff sergeant Ben
02:23:30.72 --> 02:23:36.08 staff sergeant Ben was attending the University of Colorado on the meat set program which is the same
02:23:36.08 --> 02:23:40.80 program I eventually attended a tech say them the Marine and Listic Commission education program
02:23:40.80 --> 02:23:45.68 where they take the enlisted seven to get their degrees in the ultimately uh earn a commission
02:23:46.24 --> 02:23:52.64 so I met Ben and at the age of 18 here you have the staff sergeant from the force recon community
02:23:53.36 --> 02:24:00.16 and he was humbly confident he was articulate highly respectful to everyone what differentiated
02:24:00.16 --> 02:24:05.36 him from the other Marines was even though he was you know this dual cool you know highly
02:24:05.36 --> 02:24:11.44 decorated is he was actually nicer than the other Marines he had nothing to prove and physically
02:24:11.44 --> 02:24:16.64 the whole man concept he was there he had a stature about him and when I made team I'm like
02:24:17.60 --> 02:24:24.40 dude that guy's awesome that's who I want to be that's who I want to be and I mean to the point
02:24:24.40 --> 02:24:30.80 where I enlisted in the Marine court have come a recon ring because of the image because of the
02:24:30.80 --> 02:24:36.16 person the Marine court put forward in front of young men and women like me when you have strong
02:24:36.16 --> 02:24:42.96 leaders stepping up representing their communities it it sends a very strong message to people
02:24:42.96 --> 02:24:47.84 that I want to join that and it never changed when I went to infantry school you know seven
02:24:47.84 --> 02:24:51.28 recon ring stepped in front of us and said who wants to screen the front recon and like oh my god it's
02:24:51.28 --> 02:24:57.60 like seven staff sergeant Ben's and then when I finally met the seals you know walls in the
02:24:57.60 --> 02:25:04.08 Marine court I'm like oh my god that's my next challenge and your alumni and current employees
02:25:04.08 --> 02:25:11.76 or team members are your greatest recruiting to it always yeah I was I've had many conversations
02:25:11.76 --> 02:25:18.32 with businesses as you know they're losing somebody somebody decide to leave and they start thinking
02:25:18.32 --> 02:25:21.28 about we're gonna end them with the no compete we're gonna get them with this we're gonna get
02:25:21.28 --> 02:25:28.000 them with that and I say I got a better idea why don't you wish them luck and thank them for what they
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:34.64 did while they were here and let them go about it away because if you send them out the door with a
02:25:34.64 --> 02:25:39.52 kick in the ass they're not coming back if you send them out the door and say good luck it's been
02:25:39.52 --> 02:25:43.60 great working with you first of all they're not gonna go out in the street and say you know oh
02:25:43.60 --> 02:25:47.92 joc was a jerk you don't want to work for him it's gonna go I left them but they're good people
02:25:47.92 --> 02:25:52.48 right and that those people will come back to you by the way I mean eventually they're gonna come back
02:25:52.48 --> 02:25:56.24 because you know somebody is over the reason they're leaving us because if you're treating people
02:25:56.24 --> 02:26:00.48 well the reason people are leaving us because someone is lying to them you know they're lying they're
02:26:00.48 --> 02:26:06.56 giving them some lying that they're not gonna be able to uphold so when people are leaving it's
02:26:06.56 --> 02:26:10.56 it's your alumni you got a treat them like you're alumni and say hey good luck let me know if you
02:26:10.56 --> 02:26:14.64 never need anything you know even though you're working for a competitor it's all right you know
02:26:14.64 --> 02:26:19.68 what are my friends yeah you know well we we took a one step further we have some of the uh
02:26:19.68 --> 02:26:26.000 the just great members of my team about 90 days down the road they'll call them up where they went
02:26:26.56 --> 02:26:32.08 hey how are things going for you hey was it everything that you expected I hope your
02:26:32.08 --> 02:26:35.52 experiencing great success and it's everything because there's people that move along because
02:26:35.52 --> 02:26:40.16 for whatever reason they're next challenge maybe somewhere else and you have to be accepting of that
02:26:40.16 --> 02:26:45.12 and you and you have to to your point encourage that too and if you have good number two you're
02:26:45.12 --> 02:26:49.84 falling you don't worry about it but reach out to somebody and say hey how are you doing you know what
02:26:49.84 --> 02:26:53.76 hey if things aren't going well there hey give me a call give me a call because we love to have
02:26:53.76 --> 02:26:58.40 it in your hair you wouldn't believe how many people are going you know what they don't have to admit
02:26:58.40 --> 02:27:02.88 that they made a mistake they're going you know what it wasn't as good it wasn't as good
02:27:03.92 --> 02:27:09.44 we we call we we call the ultimate litmus test it's if there's pride in the organization whether
02:27:09.44 --> 02:27:14.72 you're with the organization at that time or whatever look at the Marine Corps when somebody says hey
02:27:14.72 --> 02:27:19.68 you know what you do while I'm a former Marine they they're proclaimed proclaim that vice
02:27:20.24 --> 02:27:25.68 somebody say hey I'm a I'm a coder no if if they're pride prideful in the organization they say
02:27:25.68 --> 02:27:31.92 I'm a Googler and so when they identify with the organization it's one they're sort of identifying
02:27:31.92 --> 02:27:36.88 that there's a talent oriented culture and that there's strong leadership at that company to the
02:27:36.88 --> 02:27:41.92 point where they have a sense of pride and that becomes a talent magnet for other people at that
02:27:41.92 --> 02:27:48.96 cocktail party that you said it so very powerful we we can't sort of over index on that one enough
02:27:50.08 --> 02:27:56.56 no it it's just you know everybody in your company is a talent scout everybody in your company is an
02:27:56.56 --> 02:28:03.44 example of what you hold as important especially your leaders when they're out in the public
02:28:03.44 --> 02:28:09.44 and everybody should always be looking we talked about this like you know the term is
02:28:09.44 --> 02:28:14.80 opportunistic hiring most people are only hiring for an open position but if you've got talent
02:28:14.80 --> 02:28:18.16 scouts out there they're bringing talent to you and saying you know what dispersions a difference
02:28:18.16 --> 02:28:23.76 maker this isn't a player we have got to find a place in our organization so everybody when you have
02:28:23.76 --> 02:28:28.96 a talent mindset it's not just you know from the CEO down all the way through that you've got
02:28:28.96 --> 02:28:33.28 them mechanics and you're looking for top talent but it's all your employees once they're in the door
02:28:34.24 --> 02:28:39.52 they're branding going hey you want to come try out here this is a tough place to work and and that's
02:28:39.52 --> 02:28:44.88 exactly what happens in the special operations community there is no shortage of people signing up
02:28:44.88 --> 02:28:50.40 to get a beating no shortage whatsoever and in an ideal world if you have a company with that
02:28:50.40 --> 02:28:54.80 kind of mindset you'll have those people going you know what I got to work there because that that's
02:28:54.80 --> 02:28:59.36 going to make me better either jockey you brought a point about when somebody leaves your organization
02:28:59.36 --> 02:29:05.04 you show them respect and try to keep that relationship intact what we found great organizations
02:29:05.04 --> 02:29:10.08 do even in the hiring process if they don't hire somebody is they spill still spend time to say
02:29:10.08 --> 02:29:14.40 hey we love to debrief you on why we didn't select you for this position and they show them a
02:29:14.40 --> 02:29:19.20 great deal of respect the special operations community does this when somebody drops from the
02:29:19.20 --> 02:29:22.000 buds they do pull them aside and they have a conversation hey what do you want to do in the
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.80 Navy what have you learned from this process and they speak highly of the seals or the special forces
02:29:27.60 --> 02:29:33.28 selection process when they leave we've seen organizations that are so highly respectful to people
02:29:33.28 --> 02:29:39.52 that they don't even hire that at the end of the debrief they say wow no other organization has
02:29:39.52 --> 02:29:43.92 done that for me they just simply do some don't even respond or some just say hey we didn't
02:29:43.92 --> 02:29:49.52 select you next and they said it's not uncommon organizations that sort of follow this this tactic
02:29:49.52 --> 02:29:53.44 it's part of their culture with the person looks at him and says do you have any other positions
02:29:53.44 --> 02:29:59.28 available in that in the organization and literally make hires based off that by showing them such
02:29:59.28 --> 02:30:05.04 a great experience during that hiring process it drives me nuts to have a bad process because
02:30:05.04 --> 02:30:12.16 effectively and especially in today's era of social digital media that experience is your brand
02:30:12.16 --> 02:30:17.60 going back out in the marketplace and you've created an impression you've created a customer
02:30:17.60 --> 02:30:24.08 consumer or you've pushed one away if you didn't select them so it you know how you treat people
02:30:24.08 --> 02:30:29.28 in the process it says everything about your company says everything about having a talent mindset
02:30:29.28 --> 02:30:33.52 yeah and the bottom line with all these things that we're talking about all these behaviors is
02:30:33.52 --> 02:30:38.96 you're you have a culture that people that are talented are gonna want to go to and that's what
02:30:38.96 --> 02:30:44.16 this you know this section's about a sense of community the challenge the growth opportunities
02:30:44.16 --> 02:30:49.20 having a purpose there salary and benefits given people ownership given people control over their
02:30:49.20 --> 02:30:55.04 own destiny and that all those things you kind of sum up here with brand yourself as a talent
02:30:55.04 --> 02:30:59.36 magnet the US military especially special operations has skillful marketing and branding which
02:30:59.36 --> 02:31:04.08 is very weird for me to say but I know it's very true they're branding I mean let's face it the
02:31:04.08 --> 02:31:10.000 Marine Corps is branding itself way before branding was a thing same with the army I mean I remember
02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:16.48 I was totally brainwashed when I was a kid to be all you can be or the few the proberines like
02:31:16.48 --> 02:31:24.72 that was just 100% just my whole branding in my mind is stuck to this day you know the few
02:31:24.72 --> 02:31:31.04 the proberines Rangers lead the way that others may live day of press or lever lever how do you
02:31:31.04 --> 02:31:36.32 say that can't we we can't say that they the press or lever is that right I think you got it right
02:31:36.32 --> 02:31:43.68 yes sorry Tim Kennedy bro I'm sorry Tim Kennedy day a presso lever there you go to free the
02:31:43.68 --> 02:31:50.72 oppressed the only easy day with yesterday and what you're doing with these things is is the other
02:31:50.72 --> 02:31:57.20 the other big part of this is employee value proposition what you as an employee as employer
02:31:57.76 --> 02:32:03.84 offer to your employees and you kind of you kind of lay out some you lay out one price waterhouse
02:32:03.84 --> 02:32:12.24 coovers from empowering mentorships to customize coaching PWC provide you with the support you need
02:32:12.24 --> 02:32:17.52 to help you develop your career you'll work with people from diverse backgrounds and industries
02:32:17.52 --> 02:32:22.64 to solve important problems are you ready to grow here's the here's the Ranger one recognizing
02:32:22.64 --> 02:32:27.68 that I volunteered as a Ranger fully knowing the hazards of my chosen profession I will always
02:32:27.68 --> 02:32:33.12 endure to uphold the prestige honor and high a speed of core of the Rangers acknowledging the fact
02:32:33.12 --> 02:32:39.36 that a Ranger is a more elite soldier who arrives at the cutting edge of battle by land sea or air
02:32:39.36 --> 02:32:44.96 I accept the fact that as a Ranger my country expects me to move further faster and fight harder
02:32:44.96 --> 02:32:52.80 than any other soldier Rangers lead the way branding I hate calling that stuff brand and because it's so
02:32:52.80 --> 02:33:02.88 badass using social media to reach top talent all right let's hear it guys you guys
02:33:02.88 --> 02:33:06.64 apparently you know you just talked about this what we talked about last night with so come
02:33:06.64 --> 02:33:13.20 doing oh yeah so come and starting a podcast who did they reach out to they reach out to me but
02:33:13.20 --> 02:33:16.96 yeah it's very cool what they're doing you know they've got a they they just wanted to you know get my kind
02:33:16.96 --> 02:33:21.68 of cut on it and very cool what they're trying to do you know they're just trying to get the word out there
02:33:21.68 --> 02:33:28.24 and and then you pointed out to me that whatever a year ago so come started an Instagram account
02:33:28.24 --> 02:33:35.20 so we see our own special operations community building their social media presence so that they can
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.60 communicate with the next generation of special operations humans the military has been
02:33:42.56 --> 02:33:48.96 pretty good about this so back in the late nineties or mid nineties ex games was
02:33:49.52 --> 02:33:56.64 really coming to to to to to fruition and the military started creating their own extreme sports teams
02:33:56.64 --> 02:34:01.28 because that's where they knew the new talent is that that's where that you know the demographic
02:34:01.28 --> 02:34:07.92 of the 18 or I'm sorry let's say 15 year olds to the 25 year olds was was pushing towards that
02:34:07.92 --> 02:34:16.56 time where do you think the military is going now for recruiting video games e-sports teams
02:34:16.56 --> 02:34:20.48 they're putting e-sports teams together now if you asked our generation when they said hey we're
02:34:20.48 --> 02:34:24.96 going to go recruit out of the e-sports or video game town pools we'd probably say
02:34:24.96 --> 02:34:33.52 no way yeah that future seals and future marsawk you know Raiders and special forces are not
02:34:33.52 --> 02:34:38.000 going to come out of this communities that's wrong that's that's where the new talent lays not all
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:44.88 that they're still town out there playing sports you know on teams wrestling but you know
02:34:44.88 --> 02:34:49.36 that's just this new generation they play a lot of video games and that's where they're they're
02:34:49.36 --> 02:34:56.40 finding success with their recruiting yeah I'm curious about that video games make me nervous
02:34:56.40 --> 02:35:02.48 because people get addicted to them and yeah it's really it's a real thing it's a real thing
02:35:02.48 --> 02:35:08.000 so let's be honest yeah it missed my generation my my dad was not big on video games in the
02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.40 house we didn't have it that's why when I would go to my friends house I would stay up till four
02:35:12.40 --> 02:35:17.12 while they were sleeping playing the video games Nintendo my guidance on punch out but what did
02:35:17.12 --> 02:35:21.44 the guys usually do when we got back from operations oh bro I mean my first deployment to
02:35:21.44 --> 02:35:26.64 Iraq they had Halo set up between tents and then they had this so seals I was already like
02:35:27.28 --> 02:35:31.68 like you guys are playing video games what do you wait what is this what are you guys doing pack man
02:35:31.68 --> 02:35:36.80 I mean I don't know I'm so out of it I'm from you know back then you were really
02:35:36.80 --> 02:35:40.88 back so I'm thinking what is this so I like I went in there looked in so you see whatever
02:35:40.88 --> 02:35:46.72 the guys are playing Halo and and I just didn't really get it and I thought it was just weird
02:35:46.72 --> 02:35:51.52 couple you know five or six seals that were all into it but then they had a siege so different
02:35:51.52 --> 02:35:57.12 tournament of Halo did you hear what I just said we're in Iraq we're on deployment we're fighting
02:35:57.12 --> 02:36:04.88 the enemy and they have a at the command of joint special operations task force for Iraq
02:36:05.76 --> 02:36:10.40 they have a Halo tournament so that's a little bit embarrassing so it's embarrassing that I got
02:36:10.40 --> 02:36:15.44 seals doing it it's even more embarrassing that they have a siege so different and the height of
02:36:15.44 --> 02:36:22.64 embarrassment was when my two players went up there for the tournament not only did they win
02:36:22.64 --> 02:36:28.88 they utterly destroyed everyone and I guess in that game you you in the game Halo the version
02:36:28.88 --> 02:36:35.60 that they were playing you have to get to 50 kills and in the finals these two guys in the finals
02:36:35.60 --> 02:36:41.12 they killed the opponent 50 times and they got killed the ones and they came back and they were
02:36:41.12 --> 02:36:47.84 super stoked and I just was I was like gentlemen I'm very disappointed what's really crazy is
02:36:48.96 --> 02:36:53.36 just I mean great guys and one of them was a total freaking physical stuff the other one was
02:36:53.36 --> 02:36:57.92 when I bad asked you know pipeting seals so they were awesome guys so I don't know maybe I'm
02:36:57.92 --> 02:37:01.76 misjudged and it does make me nervous because people get addicted to those video games
02:37:03.36 --> 02:37:08.16 yeah kind of for the same reason they get addicted to other stuff too though a lot of the time
02:37:08.16 --> 02:37:13.36 because they don't have like other stuff going on necessarily but I don't know it's been kind of
02:37:13.36 --> 02:37:19.28 proven to that video games are like a good method of problem solving like in your brain so people
02:37:20.40 --> 02:37:25.60 it's true they can be conducive in certain circumstances why don't you say that you're
02:37:25.60 --> 02:37:30.64 gonna do some problems solving all very there's that too but you get guys to play video games
02:37:30.64 --> 02:37:35.04 and you just so you see what I'm saying I'm saying it can be it can have a little roll in there
02:37:35.04 --> 02:37:39.52 I just have a little roll has you said have you been good at any video game ever in your whole life
02:37:39.52 --> 02:37:45.44 you like Charlie I tried playing with these guys I would take two steps and die yeah you're talking
02:37:45.44 --> 02:37:50.64 my halo that ones like okay that's that ones kind of advanced like you mentioned Mike Tyson punch show
02:37:51.20 --> 02:37:54.72 yeah I never never admitted to that who meant Mike doesn't did you mention that yeah
02:37:54.72 --> 02:38:00.64 well it's too bad a beat like Tyson punch show I beat Mike Tyson punch out and regular punch out you know
02:38:00.64 --> 02:38:07.28 what the what the differences nothing really except one is the last guys Mike Tyson you know
02:38:07.28 --> 02:38:14.40 brown guy and then on regular punch out the last guy's Mr. Dream same exact pixel formation of the guy
02:38:14.40 --> 02:38:18.32 except he's a little lighter because that's when I think Mike Tyson ran into some problem
02:38:19.76 --> 02:38:25.60 publicly I think with the law and whatnot you know but yeah I think they just had a
02:38:25.60 --> 02:38:31.76 documentary come out on the evolution of video games for the reflex yeah
02:38:31.76 --> 02:38:35.68 shit check but thank you for staying up for this generation yes sir yeah
02:38:36.96 --> 02:38:42.80 all right moving back to the subject at hand it's I did this I have it not there everywhere
02:38:42.80 --> 02:38:47.20 creating the hiring team creating the hiring team is one of the most important decisions
02:38:47.20 --> 02:38:51.52 to make in the talent war but we see companies make the same form of stakes again and again
02:38:51.52 --> 02:38:58.72 here they are B players or C players being put in charge of hiring you already kind of mentioned that
02:38:59.52 --> 02:39:08.40 that's not a universal statement but it does happen the hiring team is homogeneous
02:39:09.44 --> 02:39:15.60 homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous there we go thank you actual Charles tighten up
02:39:15.60 --> 02:39:21.28 the English major over there the hiring team is homogeneous which means what we've got
02:39:21.28 --> 02:39:26.24 a team here and they're all they're all all engineers the same people all engineers the all sales
02:39:26.24 --> 02:39:30.32 people wanted to one together look or to put it in the context of special operations if you just
02:39:30.32 --> 02:39:35.60 selected breachers to be the team of people selecting not not not not the point man
02:39:35.60 --> 02:39:42.000 not the navigator yeah your breachers are going to look for future breachers number three there's
02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:50.88 no training what's the training that you're talking about you know how to dig in and first of all
02:39:50.88 --> 02:39:56.08 and you know i've got to say this is that every time you hire there are legal ramifications
02:39:56.08 --> 02:40:00.80 i could tell you horror stories about asking the wrong questions
02:40:03.44 --> 02:40:08.000 no it's great actually i had i literally had a senior hiring manager go in and there was a
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:14.16 lady they came in and one of his questions was is winner you do and i'm like really and yeah she
02:40:14.16 --> 02:40:19.92 wasn't pregnant so that made that just she got an offer on the spot for me we saved the company a
02:40:19.92 --> 02:40:23.84 couple million dollars and a lawsuit but the training you have to teach people to make sure that
02:40:23.84 --> 02:40:28.64 you're asking questions that are simply job related and performance related number one but number two
02:40:28.64 --> 02:40:34.08 how do you dig in and examine those questions how do you put that person under pressure how do you
02:40:34.08 --> 02:40:40.000 pressure test them and train your hiring managers otherwise you get five guys on the engineering team
02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:45.28 and to my example five breachers who are all asking questions about breaching you're asking engineers
02:40:45.28 --> 02:40:50.24 and they're all asking sit different well how did you do this at this company they go to the next
02:40:50.24 --> 02:40:55.84 person you get candidates to come out go well i answered same questions seven times and hopefully
02:40:55.84 --> 02:41:01.68 i got a right six out of seven times but you need to train your interviewing team as to what
02:41:01.68 --> 02:41:07.92 your success profile is and you know there are nine attributes but those you're not looking for
02:41:07.92 --> 02:41:13.04 all nine maybe it's three maybe it's four maybe it's two for this specific role how are you going to
02:41:13.04 --> 02:41:18.96 dig in on those and illicit responses that tell you are they a person of high drive are they a
02:41:18.96 --> 02:41:24.88 person of high resiliency are they adaptable do they have team ability how are you digging in
02:41:25.44 --> 02:41:29.60 and which characteristics you're looking for depend on what the success profile of that particular
02:41:29.60 --> 02:41:34.16 role is and you have to train people to do that interviewing is not a skill that people just
02:41:34.16 --> 02:41:40.24 out of thin air can do very very well it takes time to train and the more you train those people
02:41:40.24 --> 02:41:45.60 the you know the more clear they become on selecting the best candidate that's in front of them
02:41:46.24 --> 02:41:51.92 for that role so training them to that process what is the process that works for you
02:41:51.92 --> 02:41:56.80 for this organization you're you're you're hiring team of a players needs to understand the process
02:41:56.80 --> 02:42:01.12 and then they under they need to understand as it's just talking about is what are you looking
02:42:01.12 --> 02:42:06.56 for during that process so Brian Decker with the SFAS they would continually go through training as they
02:42:06.56 --> 02:42:11.76 came up with obstacles and identifying that hey the reason we're putting them through this specific
02:42:11.76 --> 02:42:17.44 obstacle is we're looking for these two attributes and this is how you judge based off the score
02:42:17.44 --> 02:42:23.04 card where they they they score on that attribute so that's the the training we're talking about
02:42:23.04 --> 02:42:30.24 let let me say this one thing we say a players because a true a player has humility
02:42:30.24 --> 02:42:36.72 the ability to look at a bunch of young seal candidates or a bunch of future employees and say
02:42:37.68 --> 02:42:42.80 that macro right there she has the potential to be a lot better than I am and she's going to
02:42:42.80 --> 02:42:46.40 make me she's going to raise my performance as well she's going to raise the bar and she's going to
02:42:46.40 --> 02:42:51.44 challenge me a players can do that because they want competition they want healthy competition they
02:42:51.44 --> 02:42:56.32 want to be surrounded by other a players you put B players your C players what we're saying there
02:42:56.32 --> 02:43:00.88 is again because back to you know fear based hiring is I don't want to be outshined that that
02:43:00.88 --> 02:43:06.48 Johnny Kim right there I will be a non-player in the organization if he's there we're not taking
02:43:06.48 --> 02:43:11.36 them that's what that's what that's what what happens and so when you have ego and you have people
02:43:11.36 --> 02:43:17.04 that are mediocre performers in charge of your hiring guess what you're going to get mediocre tell
02:43:18.88 --> 02:43:23.60 the last mistake that people make is hiring as a secondary function
02:43:23.60 --> 02:43:30.16 so we're not going to take jocca willing as a troop commander the task commander say hey
02:43:30.16 --> 02:43:34.72 you got to train to go to war oh hey by the way you've got to cut over the buds every day at
02:43:34.72 --> 02:43:41.36 three p.m. to assist with the assessment selection you can't do the phrase in the military two
02:43:41.36 --> 02:43:46.000 things you need one thing well yeah we take in this this is hard to take one of our
02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.76 times we take a players off the battlefield guys who want to continue going to war and we say hey
02:43:51.76 --> 02:43:56.80 for the next two years actually you're going to have a greater impact on the community your soul job
02:43:56.80 --> 02:44:00.32 your one thing it's an out of secondary function this is your primary function for the next two years
02:44:00.32 --> 02:44:07.20 or six months is focusing on filling the talent and assessing the selected people in the
02:44:07.20 --> 02:44:11.60 organization that's what it means by a secondary function and then you can score it and then you can
02:44:11.60 --> 02:44:16.40 do a feedback loop if you've got the same people and I mean you'll have multiple teams across
02:44:16.40 --> 02:44:22.24 multiple departments but once you've seen how they interview if if each one of those talented
02:44:22.24 --> 02:44:27.84 candidates is going through the same group of people and getting the same structure you can go back
02:44:27.84 --> 02:44:32.80 and evaluate the results you can get that feedback loop okay we hired this person how did they do
02:44:34.16 --> 02:44:38.96 or we hired this person and they didn't do well what did we miss in the process and you're going
02:44:38.96 --> 02:44:43.60 back to the same group of people is how to iterate a little bit better and you get a little bit
02:44:43.60 --> 02:44:50.16 better each time but if you keep changing that team out you're effectively you have no standard
02:44:50.16 --> 02:44:55.12 or you get the standard of the day with the team that you put together but if you get those a
02:44:55.12 --> 02:45:02.88 players you make hiring the priority for what they do you train them properly you can look at how
02:45:02.88 --> 02:45:07.60 we're doing and how do we exponentially increase what they're doing that's hard for a business
02:45:07.60 --> 02:45:13.52 leader to sometimes very hard very very hard so what you tell me to do is take my best salesman
02:45:13.52 --> 02:45:19.36 or saleswoman take them off the line for six months and have them focus on hiring the next
02:45:19.36 --> 02:45:27.36 generation of sales leaders and our answer is yes in the short term a tactical mindset that may hurt
02:45:28.40 --> 02:45:33.84 if you have a strategic mindset for the long term for the long run if he hires
02:45:33.84 --> 02:45:40.32 three or four solid sales leaders that's going to have a much more exponential effect
02:45:40.32 --> 02:45:45.12 and impact on the organization again that's hard to do it was hard for the sealed community
02:45:45.12 --> 02:45:48.72 to take guys like you off the battlefield and say hey we need you to run training now
02:45:48.72 --> 02:45:53.12 we know where you wanted to be and so again a lot of this is getting
02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.16 that we say talent mindset getting business leaders just to make that mental paradigm shift
02:45:58.16 --> 02:46:04.08 of how do that tactical mindset into a strategic mindset to play the long game and that's what
02:46:04.08 --> 02:46:10.88 the talent war is it's the long game it's just that important it you know everything in your
02:46:10.88 --> 02:46:15.92 environment your your product your service the economy the market the global conditions are
02:46:15.92 --> 02:46:21.76 going to change and they're going to change rapidly but those nine attributes don't change
02:46:21.76 --> 02:46:30.16 and they allow you to confront any circumstance as a business with confidence and a win
02:46:30.88 --> 02:46:35.28 those things just won't change everything around you will change but those leadership principles
02:46:35.28 --> 02:46:40.96 those nine character attributes those are the foundations and they will let you attack and win
02:46:40.96 --> 02:46:45.12 in any given situation when you don't pay attention to them you're firefighting
02:46:45.84 --> 02:46:50.08 covid comes along oh my god what do we do everybody's you know chicken little's and and it
02:46:50.08 --> 02:46:55.12 becomes a very difficult problem to solve versus okay got it Roger that's today's situation
02:46:55.52 --> 02:47:04.40 let's go next section here's characters revealed at one's limits and there's a subsection
02:47:04.40 --> 02:47:10.80 called mic feels the pressure this is it Mike thought staring up the rope i'm going to fail out of
02:47:10.80 --> 02:47:16.40 buds because of a freaking rope two weeks prior mic it completed hell week the instructors had
02:47:16.40 --> 02:47:19.84 even pulled them aside and said you're one of the standout leaders in the class we know what
02:47:19.84 --> 02:47:24.000 you can do as a leader so we need you to step aside so that we can test and evaluate other officers
02:47:24.56 --> 02:47:29.68 yet now mic was struggling to climb a basic rope like he had been climbing since day one of the
02:47:29.68 --> 02:47:34.64 Marine Corps he had been climbing ropes for years and he was good at it he'd never failed to get
02:47:34.64 --> 02:47:40.96 up one until now for the first time in training mic was displaying serious signs of fatigue it was
02:47:40.96 --> 02:47:47.20 an ideal moment to test him so the instructors dug in shouting up at him the other students who had
02:47:47.20 --> 02:47:52.64 already completed the exercise watched from their nearby formation mic started up the rope again
02:47:52.64 --> 02:47:58.24 he could sense all eyes on him he could feel the pressure he made it ten feet and dropped
02:47:58.88 --> 02:48:06.000 the instructors kept yelling and mic started up the rope again and again and again mic was frustrated
02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:10.80 he felt like a dirt bag for not being able to get up the rope but there was no way he was going to
02:48:10.80 --> 02:48:16.56 quit he started up the rope again and fell again he got to his feet and prepared to start
02:48:16.56 --> 02:48:21.44 up the rope again but the instructors stopped him and pulled him aside out of view from the other students
02:48:22.16 --> 02:48:28.16 it's okay we all have these days one of the instructors said we wanted to apply some pressure to you
02:48:28.16 --> 02:48:35.12 to see how you would react and whether you would quit the instructors didn't really care whether mic
02:48:35.12 --> 02:48:44.56 made it to the top of the rope or not good little test see where it's at that that day and again
02:48:44.56 --> 02:48:49.04 I'd been in the Marine Corps for what five years at this point climb plenty of ropes was going to
02:48:49.04 --> 02:48:56.16 climb the ropes I remember that day just something with the body was off I had zero energy and
02:48:56.16 --> 02:49:05.44 you talk about feeling like the eyes were on me it was almost near tears not not from the pressure
02:49:05.44 --> 02:49:13.28 but I would just spent all that together I was I was done and I mean it just reinforces the point
02:49:13.28 --> 02:49:19.52 that you know you say character cannot be created where none exists and you truly don't know people
02:49:20.24 --> 02:49:25.52 until you push them to the limits that's not just physical limits that's also mental limits
02:49:25.52 --> 02:49:30.16 and that's the point of the special operations assessment and selection it's not because we're
02:49:30.16 --> 02:49:36.08 sadistic maybe we are a little but it's not to put these young men and women through
02:49:36.08 --> 02:49:42.16 you know paying for our benefit there's a purpose behind it much like an interview process
02:49:42.72 --> 02:49:47.68 is we know that once we can push them to the threshold that's our moment okay now we're going to see
02:49:48.40 --> 02:49:52.32 if this individual has what it takes if they have the right attributes one of the things in
02:49:52.32 --> 02:49:57.84 you go back to the attributes one of one of our colleagues Jason Tuchen you know you talked about
02:49:57.84 --> 02:50:02.88 resiliency the whole point of a lot of you know the special operations assessment selection is to see
02:50:02.88 --> 02:50:07.84 how resilient people are he talked about in buds attracts much like the other special operations
02:50:07.84 --> 02:50:14.48 some pretty phenomenal human beings like NCAA athletes and Olympic athletes and when he ran
02:50:14.48 --> 02:50:20.48 first phase he saw a lot of these you know what people consider exceptional athletes quit
02:50:21.44 --> 02:50:26.08 and he said they were low on resiliency because this was the first time they had failed
02:50:26.88 --> 02:50:30.64 in their life and that's a point in the training as he says just to keep knocking people down
02:50:30.64 --> 02:50:36.40 to see how they react and when you have a high achiever who's never really experienced failure
02:50:36.40 --> 02:50:43.52 and they repeatedly fail in buds or these other assessment programs sometimes they quit
02:50:43.52 --> 02:50:50.000 and that's what you're looking for but somebody who's experienced nothing but obstacles in their
02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:55.68 life is well is more prepared for what they face in special operations and more equipped to deal
02:50:55.68 --> 02:51:01.04 with crisis than some of these exceptional athletes who just never really face challenge.
02:51:02.88 --> 02:51:08.24 Yeah you're gonna fail some stuff they're gonna make sure you fail some stuff 100% like you're not
02:51:08.24 --> 02:51:12.000 going to pass everything not care who you are they're going to make you sure you fail some stuff
02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:18.16 to make sure that when you do fail something you don't lose the bubble you talk a little bit about
02:51:18.16 --> 02:51:25.52 the interview process and you go into the interview process here and here's a strategy on
02:51:25.52 --> 02:51:30.72 on you go a bunch of stuff I'm gonna skip to one part for guidance on strategy look to special
02:51:30.72 --> 02:51:36.56 operations murder boards murder boards are not quite as terrifying as they sound they are full
02:51:36.56 --> 02:51:42.64 of pressure but professionally run and operators sits on one side of the table and on the other side
02:51:42.88 --> 02:51:49.04 is a psychologist and five to eight senior enlisted and officers representing the entire community
02:51:49.04 --> 02:51:54.000 the psychologist has previously assessed the operator to identify potential red flags
02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:59.12 the senior panel then digs in raising the pressure by probing the red flags and presenting
02:51:59.12 --> 02:52:04.64 complex scenarios they ask difficult questions and push against sore spots to see how the
02:52:04.64 --> 02:52:10.56 operator reacts if you approach your interviews a little more like a soft murder board you can
02:52:10.56 --> 02:52:17.12 reveal valuable information to that end we have five tips number one know what you're looking for
02:52:17.12 --> 02:52:24.48 with each question number two create a core set of questions to be used with each candidate number three
02:52:24.48 --> 02:52:31.84 ask scenario based and behavioral questions number four add challenges number five push candidates
02:52:31.84 --> 02:52:40.08 outside their comfort zone gotta be careful on the legal side of this huh George you did you do
02:52:41.44 --> 02:52:45.68 and and that's where you know that training comes in that we talked about earlier you people
02:52:45.68 --> 02:52:52.16 have to understand you know hiring decisions there's a lot of law around it and so you want to
02:52:52.16 --> 02:52:56.88 train those people effectively but you can create an enormous amount of pressure on somebody by
02:52:56.88 --> 02:53:01.52 asking them difficult questions and you know it's funny when we're when when we're teaching
02:53:01.52 --> 02:53:07.52 veteran candidates do you the number one candidate or the number one question that stumps people
02:53:07.52 --> 02:53:12.16 executives and military people alike I'll just ask a simple question tell me about your leadership
02:53:12.16 --> 02:53:17.60 style and people think from muscle memory they have muscle memory they oh I should be able to answer
02:53:17.60 --> 02:53:21.92 this and they go on and on and on and on and on I get that with the exact I get that with veterans
02:53:21.92 --> 02:53:27.60 but push people to to describe themselves put them in uncomfortable situations talk about failures
02:53:27.60 --> 02:53:33.04 tell me about a time that you failed and there's several executives that if you can't talk about
02:53:33.04 --> 02:53:39.36 how you failed and failed miserably and got back up and what you learned from it that's a person
02:53:39.36 --> 02:53:44.16 you need to avoid but yeah there's there's a lot of law around it but if you know what you're looking
02:53:44.16 --> 02:53:48.96 for with each question you plan your questions you plan your inner you know your interviewing
02:53:48.96 --> 02:53:53.60 panel your murder board you can create a lot of pressure but mind you there's a balance too
02:53:53.60 --> 02:53:58.000 because you you don't want to make it like the military version of it because candidates go okay
02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:02.72 I'm not working there but there's you can carve a simple balance where they know they're
02:54:02.72 --> 02:54:07.28 going to be tested in your environment and those people that know they're going to be tested in
02:54:07.28 --> 02:54:11.92 your environment the right people are going to be drawn to your environment because of that test
02:54:12.64 --> 02:54:17.52 any any person who's of talent that's worth their salt that comes to an easy interview process
02:54:17.52 --> 02:54:21.68 and rocks it in the back of their head when they walk out the doors are going okay that was a little
02:54:21.68 --> 02:54:26.72 bit easy and so now they're starting to think about okay that's that was a little too easy
02:54:26.72 --> 02:54:31.28 but a person with true talent that wants to be challenged it wants to be valued and you know
02:54:31.28 --> 02:54:36.40 working in an environment where there's the grind in the drive that tough process they're going to
02:54:36.40 --> 02:54:42.000 go okay I'm ready for this bring it let's go let's do this and you find out a lot by putting
02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:47.28 people under pressure in that scenario and let's dispel the notion that you know we call it a murder
02:54:47.28 --> 02:54:51.52 board and you've you've been on them people aren't y'all in edge yeah and I'm just out of that
02:54:51.52 --> 02:54:56.32 and and they're looking if you've given the answer they whether they like it or not they're
02:54:56.32 --> 02:55:00.88 they're going to dig a little in a very professional manner and and some murder boards go
02:55:00.88 --> 02:55:05.20 quickly because they identify that this person's humble and they're admitting you know past mistakes
02:55:05.20 --> 02:55:09.20 and that they learn from it and that they're they're still working progress and improving
02:55:09.20 --> 02:55:13.68 and there's murder boards go quickly it's the others where somebody comes in they're overly confident
02:55:13.68 --> 02:55:18.56 they're arrogant and so that's where people that are trained to assess those behaviors and this
02:55:18.56 --> 02:55:24.64 is one big behavioral interview this is the military's version of a behavioral interview those go
02:55:24.64 --> 02:55:31.20 very long and it it almost becomes like a confessional they just they just keep digging themselves
02:55:31.20 --> 02:55:36.08 now another tactic to that is after you put the person through a murder board it's like one
02:55:36.08 --> 02:55:40.08 person goes out and say hey what how'd you feel about that process what what do you think you
02:55:40.08 --> 02:55:45.92 can do better what areas didn't you expand upon to see now if they can do a what do we call
02:55:45.92 --> 02:55:49.20 a brutally honest self assessment like hey you know what man I wish I could do that again
02:55:50.48 --> 02:55:54.32 I missed this this I didn't reinforce this point and so if that person's training they come back in
02:55:54.32 --> 02:56:01.84 and say hey real real self reflective after action that they just gave and one of the reasons
02:56:01.84 --> 02:56:06.40 that we put this specific technique in there is because most interviews and companies are done
02:56:06.40 --> 02:56:13.84 on a one-to-one basis and Jocco echo I bet I you could I could put you in one of these murder
02:56:13.84 --> 02:56:18.56 boards and you could watch three other people ask questions and they'll have their opinions
02:56:18.56 --> 02:56:27.28 but just in the observation mode that is of tremendous value just to watch people how they answer
02:56:27.28 --> 02:56:33.68 how they act how they think how they reasoned through a particular scenario how they explain
02:56:33.68 --> 02:56:39.68 their problem solving methodology so so many interviews due to the firefighting and the time and you
02:56:39.68 --> 02:56:43.92 know that this is reactionary they don't put the time into it they don't put people in a room and go
02:56:43.92 --> 02:56:49.92 okay this was my impression of the answer to the question this is how I think they'll work or
02:56:49.92 --> 02:56:55.04 succeed or fail or struggle in this particular environment you can get actually a lot out of
02:56:55.04 --> 02:57:00.96 observation which is why we put this in the book to give an example of what are on those murder
02:57:00.96 --> 02:57:04.80 boards and you probably remember this one is they're they're gonna ask you an ethical question
02:57:04.80 --> 02:57:11.04 you're dealing with a boss who does something highly unethical you know what actions do you take
02:57:11.04 --> 02:57:18.08 and the response is going to tell you a lot about the person yeah yeah and you guys do a great
02:57:18.08 --> 02:57:23.04 job of kind of laying all the stuff out from how to observe them to do a role plays with them
02:57:23.04 --> 02:57:30.56 sent case case studies and scenarios you've got all that stuff in here observation what to look for
02:57:30.56 --> 02:57:35.60 how to look for it different situations you can look for it and I mean it's just it's just a very
02:57:35.60 --> 02:57:42.96 thorough chapter and then you get into assessment tests and you talk about you know the IQ test
02:57:42.96 --> 02:57:54.32 at the army used and just the different assessment tests that get used now so that's all good
02:57:54.32 --> 02:57:57.52 and one of those tests you comment on here one company we work with that yeah
02:57:57.52 --> 02:58:02.24 if Overwatch using aptitude motivation and personality assessment to weed out candidates are
02:58:02.24 --> 02:58:06.64 veterans despite being high performers we're all scoring very low on the test and thus being
02:58:06.64 --> 02:58:13.60 eliminated from the hiring process curious might took the test for himself his score just 57% of
02:58:13.60 --> 02:58:21.52 failing grade so what was up with that test so your assessment test naturally had bias
02:58:23.04 --> 02:58:28.72 built in by whoever designed that test and there was a bias against you know I'm not saying in the
02:58:28.72 --> 02:58:34.40 native light veterans are very different from the demographic that test was based around
02:58:35.12 --> 02:58:39.04 the bottom line we're trying to say here's the assessments are good it's another layer to the
02:58:39.04 --> 02:58:43.84 process that you use to select people especially if you have talent profiles and when you do these
02:58:43.84 --> 02:58:48.56 talent profiles to identify your high performers you also want to do that against your low performers
02:58:48.56 --> 02:58:53.92 to see if the assessment test is actually accurate because if your high performers know performers
02:58:53.92 --> 02:59:00.000 in the same role or generally getting the same results that got a assessment test is most likely
02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:07.76 not relevant or added value to that process is it yeah is it measuring what you want it to measure
02:59:07.76 --> 02:59:14.80 right is it determining the success factors and one of the challenges with companies is that and
02:59:14.80 --> 02:59:20.000 this is just you know kind of that that inside the talent acquisition function and talent management
02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:25.52 function people will buy and enterprise wide solution and apply that test across the board
02:59:26.08 --> 02:59:30.64 and just say okay this test applies to everybody and in my particular case it's screening
02:59:30.64 --> 02:59:37.44 out veterans and we're able to look at that and go every yes something's wrong but it's hard to
02:59:37.44 --> 02:59:43.68 persuade people that you know something they've invested a good amount of money in is not showing
02:59:43.68 --> 02:59:48.64 them what it should show them I mean they're very wedded to their solution they're they're bought
02:59:48.64 --> 02:59:54.08 in and it's hard to move them off the mark but Mike was an exceptional example of where people are
02:59:54.08 --> 03:00:01.28 using something that's not showing success factors that you want it to be showing you it's another
03:00:01.28 --> 03:00:07.60 data point yeah which so we do see companies that use these personality assessments as a
03:00:07.60 --> 03:00:15.04 either no go or go criteria and I would caution people not to do that you talked about not being
03:00:15.04 --> 03:00:21.60 a rules follower funny enough we had a company that recently assessed one of our people and you know
03:00:21.60 --> 03:00:27.04 I won't say what's physical organization this person works for but he's with a very unique
03:00:27.04 --> 03:00:32.40 or organization and he's been in that seat for five years which is an indicator that this guy is
03:00:32.40 --> 03:00:37.60 is a high performing individual ethical absolutely and when he took this test the company came back
03:00:37.60 --> 03:00:42.16 and said this guy's not you know it shows that he doesn't follow rules and we sort of had to
03:00:42.16 --> 03:00:47.60 explain the context of the role he was in and say he finds a way to win and that may be why
03:00:48.32 --> 03:00:52.72 he's not testing well in that one criteria on that assessment so you've got to be cautious even
03:00:52.72 --> 03:00:57.28 like Josh cotton Dr. Cotton that does this for a living what will caution you
03:00:58.40 --> 03:01:02.16 with regards to results on assessments he said you got to take it with a grain of salt
03:01:02.16 --> 03:01:08.08 and some people to use a phrase that that you know I remember hearing it muster actually
03:01:08.08 --> 03:01:14.56 assessment tests are not inoculations they don't insulate you from making a bad hire they don't
03:01:14.56 --> 03:01:20.64 inoculate you from you know all the risk in the world you need to use them as my says they're
03:01:20.64 --> 03:01:26.56 just one more data point but they it all begins and ends with knowing what success looks like
03:01:26.56 --> 03:01:32.56 for a particular role and that requires thought it requires you know planning and and mapping that
03:01:32.56 --> 03:01:39.76 out how you're going to go do it like I said you got that chapter locked in the next chapter
03:01:40.56 --> 03:01:47.20 goes into the fact that you can't hire or fire your way to success talent acquisition is only
03:01:47.20 --> 03:01:52.24 one part of a two variable equation for success talent plus leadership equals victory
03:01:53.52 --> 03:02:00.64 and then there's a story in here about Mike and a little task unit that you were in called task unit
03:02:00.64 --> 03:02:06.88 Charlie and what's interesting about task unit Charlie so task unit bruiser and task unit Charlie
03:02:06.88 --> 03:02:12.80 and task unit alpha we're all at seal team three and every one of those task units had
03:02:13.52 --> 03:02:18.08 some great guys and you know if you put the bell curve on all of them they'd all be
03:02:18.08 --> 03:02:23.36 relatively the same group of you know seals you know couple low guys couple high guys
03:02:23.36 --> 03:02:28.000 bunch of guys in the middle just just kind of typical nothing good or bad just typical
03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:34.08 but it didn't really work out that way from a leadership perspective no it did not so pulled
03:02:34.08 --> 03:02:38.88 from the same talent pull away like you said the talent profile for both the task units was the
03:02:38.88 --> 03:02:45.12 exact same and this is where you know we caution people in the you know this is why we end
03:02:45.12 --> 03:02:51.92 the book with this chapter is you had two groups where the resources the talent everything was
03:02:51.92 --> 03:03:00.48 predominantly the same same budgets same weapon systems same people really and one rise raised to
03:03:00.48 --> 03:03:08.32 the occasion and one fell below the standard in the seal teams and was toxic and the final determination
03:03:08.32 --> 03:03:17.52 was leadership so bad leadership can poison any talent pull of exceptional people it just can't
03:03:17.52 --> 03:03:28.24 and in that I'm so fortunate I got to observe that at a young tenure in my career and what I
03:03:28.24 --> 03:03:34.24 benefited to is you know I got plucked out of that task unit but you're task unit and it talks
03:03:34.24 --> 03:03:38.64 about how I wasn't the root of the problem but the person that was the root of the problem
03:03:38.64 --> 03:03:44.64 I basically threatened because I have an allergic reaction to people that are just selfish
03:03:44.64 --> 03:03:49.44 and all about themselves and this individual wasn't he he wasn't to solely blame but he was the
03:03:49.44 --> 03:03:56.08 impetus of the the problem and so I came I guess with warnings when they sent me over to you and
03:03:56.64 --> 03:04:00.88 then all the sudden I started prosper and I've become your operations officer I was your assistant
03:04:00.88 --> 03:04:06.16 operations officer you put me in charge of operations officer you that was a motive and then you promoted
03:04:06.16 --> 03:04:11.92 me two months later to Delta between a.o.i.c. you know the funny thing is a lot of the guys the
03:04:11.92 --> 03:04:18.40 deployment after that were sestone took basically task unit bruiser back to Iraq we ended up in the
03:04:18.40 --> 03:04:25.04 battle of southern city a majority of the guys in that troop were from task unit Charlie so again
03:04:25.04 --> 03:04:30.24 you put them under a great litter and they did exceptional things so that's why we say you can no longer
03:04:30.24 --> 03:04:34.72 well you know you can't fire or hire fire your way to success ultimately you have to lead and you
03:04:34.72 --> 03:04:39.76 have to develop your people and that's what this chapter is about yeah we we kind of brought it around
03:04:39.76 --> 03:04:45.20 to you know as we mentioned earlier in the book you have to treat your human capital as importantly
03:04:45.84 --> 03:04:52.08 or as important as your financial capital and this was a way to kind of close that out to say
03:04:52.08 --> 03:04:57.60 the journey doesn't end when you hire a players you get this whole process right that's not the
03:04:57.60 --> 03:05:02.72 end of it you're not done and we did this ill video clip and we call it the talent war
03:05:02.72 --> 03:05:09.20 the interesting thing about this title is and and we went into this in the video is that war doesn't end
03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:14.88 it's continuous you're gonna win some battles but there's no point in this even if you read this
03:05:14.88 --> 03:05:19.84 book if you do everything in this book and Mike and I are working with you and everything goes perfectly
03:05:19.84 --> 03:05:26.24 you don't get to declare victory people grow people change products change the environment changes
03:05:26.24 --> 03:05:34.08 people move on you have to keep after this this is a discipline that you need to bring to your company
03:05:34.08 --> 03:05:39.68 and when you do you will have a competitive advantage it's the path it's part of the path
03:05:41.84 --> 03:05:46.48 back to the book far too often a company will hire talented candidate a talented candidate who's
03:05:46.48 --> 03:05:50.88 performance ends up being lackluster the company chalks up to a bad hire fires the person
03:05:50.88 --> 03:05:56.96 starts all over again a costly assumption there are many reasons someone might not be performing as you expect
03:05:57.52 --> 03:06:02.96 and only one of them is a bad hire chances are if a talented individual is not performing to standard
03:06:02.96 --> 03:06:13.36 it's not their fault it's yours a little extreme ownership coming at you live
03:06:13.36 --> 03:06:20.72 public talent work talent development you guys talk about training mentoring and coaching
03:06:22.64 --> 03:06:28.80 good quote and hear from Jonah Pinto from 711 CEO most important thing in any organization is leadership
03:06:29.20 --> 03:06:32.56 it's always leadership first because leaders find a way to get things done
03:06:34.80 --> 03:06:41.76 once again something up a great attitude and and for the listeners to open to is actually a
03:06:41.76 --> 03:06:46.80 west point the military academy graduate he served as a army officer before he entered the
03:06:46.80 --> 03:06:52.80 the corporate world leadership is the most critical determinant of achieving victory for business
03:06:52.80 --> 03:06:56.72 leaders are the ones who drive change makes things happen so when working to transform high
03:06:56.72 --> 03:07:02.32 potential high potentials into high performers it's critical to identify and develop future
03:07:02.32 --> 03:07:12.32 leaders that's just the way it's got to be and then wrapping this up a little bit here
03:07:13.92 --> 03:07:18.88 actually this I'll wrap this up right here with this like it's not quite the closer but it's close
03:07:19.84 --> 03:07:23.28 a true talent mindset like I said this is kind of the underlying thread of the book
03:07:23.28 --> 03:07:27.76 remember the most critical step in winning the war on talent is developing the talent mindset
03:07:27.76 --> 03:07:32.32 the deep belief that human capital is the single most important competitive advantage your company
03:07:32.32 --> 03:07:37.04 can have if you truly believe human capital is your greatest competitive advantage you won't
03:07:37.04 --> 03:07:42.32 stop with a hiring process you will continue to invest in and develop your people creating an
03:07:42.32 --> 03:07:48.56 unbroken chain of excellence that's what good leaders do that's how great organizations are formed
03:07:49.36 --> 03:07:53.68 the training and leadership development opportunities you provide your employees reveal the
03:07:53.68 --> 03:08:00.000 truth of your talent mindset you might be able to attract candidates with a talk of a talent mindset
03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:06.24 but if you want them to stay you need to show your employees that you truly value talent
03:08:06.24 --> 03:08:13.52 by helping them to grow into their potential starts with you if you demonstrate exemplary leadership
03:08:13.52 --> 03:08:20.000 others will follow practice a talent mindset mentoring coach your key leaders put in the time and
03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:26.08 effort to develop your people into something great and a great organization will emerge
03:08:29.84 --> 03:08:38.32 so that's I mean then you you go on you have a good closing but you know that's it it's
03:08:38.32 --> 03:08:42.88 recruiting selecting training mentorship putting the right people in the right places
03:08:42.88 --> 03:08:49.60 think about that's what putting the right people in the right places all those things
03:08:50.72 --> 03:08:56.64 are really one thing and that is leadership and this is how you build a team and leaders have
03:08:56.64 --> 03:09:03.04 to understand the importance of that they have to understand the importance of building the correct team
03:09:04.16 --> 03:09:10.56 so one thing that we're doing you know is obviously helping people build these teams with EFO
03:09:10.56 --> 03:09:19.52 overwatch tell me a little bit about the process at EFO for watch to take and find the right people
03:09:19.52 --> 03:09:27.12 bring them in and get them assigned to the right companies out there these and you know a lot of
03:09:27.12 --> 03:09:31.28 people say hey you guys are veteran recruiting for I sort of actually push back I say no we are
03:09:31.28 --> 03:09:37.04 our leadership talent acquisition firm we we only deal with military leaders and people naturally
03:09:37.04 --> 03:09:42.24 put a rank on that oh senior enlisted or or officers you know it's all levels in the military
03:09:42.24 --> 03:09:49.84 as long as they have the attributes we're looking for especially humility so the military leaders
03:09:49.84 --> 03:09:54.96 come coming out of the military you have already been highly vetted and guess what they have
03:09:54.96 --> 03:10:00.88 rep mutations and it's very easy for us to reach back into those communities and reach into the
03:10:00.88 --> 03:10:05.28 seals and say hey does anyone know this chakra willing guy yeah I want your buds with them
03:10:05.28 --> 03:10:10.88 solid another guy says I did two platoons with them you can not find a more reliable team or
03:10:10.88 --> 03:10:16.16 any any individual and that's what we need to hear we are also putting them through multiple assessments
03:10:16.16 --> 03:10:21.92 Josh's EPI we're going to start utilizing that as a basis for us plus we want to collect data
03:10:21.92 --> 03:10:27.12 to see if we can start identifying the difference between high performers middle performers in
03:10:27.12 --> 03:10:34.72 low performers and he's already started that that process and then really with with the candidate side
03:10:34.72 --> 03:10:40.88 it's so simple it's very easy to identify the ones that are just you've got it and we're really
03:10:40.88 --> 03:10:46.32 looking for the top 10 20% of every community in the military and those that don't fall into that
03:10:46.32 --> 03:10:51.36 realm we still want to help them with training we're dedicated to our brothers and sisters in
03:10:51.36 --> 03:10:56.08 our arms to make sure that they're they're successful we can't place every candidate you know
03:10:56.08 --> 03:11:00.72 we just don't have enough job opportunities one day we will but if one thing for the military
03:11:00.72 --> 03:11:05.44 leaders that come to us they go through some of the best training but they go through the extreme
03:11:05.44 --> 03:11:09.52 ownership and what what we and we talked about this last night the reason I love extreme ownership
03:11:09.52 --> 03:11:15.12 is I've never seen two people you in life create a leadership system that is so simple because
03:11:15.12 --> 03:11:19.60 if you go ask the Air Force army the Navy the Marine Corps they're all they're all going to give
03:11:19.60 --> 03:11:26.16 you different answers on what attributes are important and what are the the primary principles
03:11:26.16 --> 03:11:31.04 of leadership they're all saying the same thing but it's not codified so what extreme ownership and
03:11:31.04 --> 03:11:35.84 even for the candidates reading the book is what we tell them is hey in the interview process you
03:11:35.84 --> 03:11:40.08 have to tell story why we love extreme ownership so much is not only is it going to help you
03:11:40.08 --> 03:11:45.28 contextualize your leadership experience and that's what they need help with some of these leaders
03:11:45.28 --> 03:11:50.56 coming out special operations leaders who have been serving for 20 years leading is muscle memory
03:11:50.56 --> 03:11:54.80 to them now and that's why if you ask them the question tells about your leadership style some
03:11:54.80 --> 03:11:59.60 struggle through it but when we teach them the context of extreme ownership they start to
03:11:59.60 --> 03:12:05.68 get their story and the way you guys wrote the book combat story principle business context
03:12:05.68 --> 03:12:10.32 helps them to translate we all know the number one challenge for veterans trying to get jobs is
03:12:10.32 --> 03:12:14.80 translating their experience extreme ownership sets them on the path to doing that in a good
03:12:14.80 --> 03:12:20.96 manner then I handle that first part of them they get George and Carly Walden and
03:12:20.96 --> 03:12:26.56 they put them through search training they prepare them for the interview process the feedback
03:12:26.56 --> 03:12:31.84 we're getting from senior special operations leaders to other military leaders is this is the
03:12:31.84 --> 03:12:38.80 best advice I've ever gotten from taps and all these other programs that we go through we don't
03:12:38.80 --> 03:12:43.52 sugarcoat anything we give them the reality of the situation and we're very straightforward that
03:12:44.16 --> 03:12:49.92 it's on you we can't step into the interview with you it is on you to convey your value to the
03:12:49.92 --> 03:12:55.60 organization and get them to say yes they want to say yes that's the military leader side
03:12:56.24 --> 03:13:04.08 and talk about rewarding work not only do we do we we we make a you know a good paycheck from from
03:13:04.08 --> 03:13:08.96 this mine of work it's also the emotional return on investment from senior in our former
03:13:08.96 --> 03:13:13.92 brothers and sisters step into senior management positions and then crush it that's feedback we get
03:13:13.92 --> 03:13:22.48 from business leaders best higher I've I've ever made on the the client side we screen our clients
03:13:22.48 --> 03:13:27.04 is diligently as we screen our candidates and this has been a learning process we've had to learn
03:13:27.04 --> 03:13:32.64 this through scars and it comes down to I need the clients to commit and I need to hear that they
03:13:32.64 --> 03:13:38.72 have a foundation of belief that leadership is wildly and infinitely more important than in
03:13:38.72 --> 03:13:43.76 street experience if we hear that from the clients we believe they truly understand that then that's a
03:13:43.76 --> 03:13:48.56 client we're most likely going to work with but if we get a client we've had this like hey listen
03:13:48.56 --> 03:13:52.16 I need a leader right now to step into this role I don't want to have to train them I don't want
03:13:52.16 --> 03:13:55.60 to have to build a relationship with them literally said this I just need them to do their job
03:13:56.16 --> 03:14:00.24 and it was a lucrative role we said hey we're not the best fit because we know that that
03:14:00.24 --> 03:14:04.64 relationship is just going to end poorly so also clients come to us and they say we need to
03:14:04.64 --> 03:14:09.20 fill in 20 days they've already compromised the process and we're not going to do that so we're very
03:14:09.20 --> 03:14:17.76 prideful on the white love service that we provide and if we don't have many misses at all but if we
03:14:17.76 --> 03:14:23.36 find out a candidate it didn't work it is like a get punch it is like our reputation has been
03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:29.60 marked and that we take it very seriously and I think that's what you know sort of
03:14:29.60 --> 03:14:36.40 differentiates us from from a lot of the executive search firms out there is I know we together
03:14:36.40 --> 03:14:40.56 in George we're going to build this into the number one leadership town acquisition firm in the
03:14:40.56 --> 03:14:45.12 nation I have no doubt then when people look for directors of leadership in training as well as
03:14:45.12 --> 03:14:49.28 chief leadership officers they're going to say go to you if overwatch because the men and women
03:14:49.28 --> 03:14:54.64 were placing know how to train people they know how to create the foundation for strong
03:14:54.64 --> 03:14:58.64 cultures and that's really where we're making the name right now we'll still place people in the
03:14:58.64 --> 03:15:03.84 COO roles general management roles but one of my passions for you if overwatch is that that
03:15:03.84 --> 03:15:12.24 director of leadership in training or the COO position yeah you know just to be completely
03:15:12.24 --> 03:15:16.56 transparent to be in talent acquisition you have to have a pretty strong mass acoustic gene
03:15:16.56 --> 03:15:23.76 about you because it's a brutal a brutal job function but I've been helping veterans for over 20
03:15:23.76 --> 03:15:29.60 years and where it started was I want to be able to give to our brothers and sisters and arms of
03:15:29.60 --> 03:15:33.44 things that I didn't have when I transitioned out in the 90s and what they didn't have was
03:15:33.44 --> 03:15:39.60 actionable information and we deal once we go through selection kind of assessment and finding
03:15:39.60 --> 03:15:44.72 that right candidate with all those attributes they're still this bridge between the ideal
03:15:44.72 --> 03:15:49.20 opportunity for that veteran leader for that senior leader and that position it's called the
03:15:49.20 --> 03:15:55.84 interview and that is very very difficult for veterans to cross that divide to be able to articulate
03:15:55.84 --> 03:16:01.68 clearly and then a crisp professional impactful manner in the interview that you're going to be able
03:16:01.68 --> 03:16:08.32 to over deliver in that particular role so it isn't just you know we're doing all facets of it and
03:16:08.32 --> 03:16:14.88 I think that's what makes the dynamic between me and Mike and our team so well so good so solid and so
03:16:14.88 --> 03:16:20.48 different is that you have 20 years of selection and assessment we both been in leadership roles I've
03:16:20.48 --> 03:16:26.32 been in the executive roles and we're bringing actionable information to top military leaders
03:16:26.32 --> 03:16:32.24 so that they are ready for that transition into corporate America and when you put that person
03:16:32.24 --> 03:16:38.32 in that position it gets more veteran hiring and so we have to get it right with the company
03:16:38.32 --> 03:16:42.72 we have to get it right with the veteran and and there's some veterans that we we're not going
03:16:42.72 --> 03:16:50.000 to place but we're absolutely agnostic if they come to us we're going to help but crossing that bridge
03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:55.36 screening our our candidates screening our clients we are very meticulous about how we go about
03:16:55.36 --> 03:17:03.20 doing that yeah I think talking to some of the clients of people that we've placed and just
03:17:03.20 --> 03:17:08.48 awesome to hear everything that you guys are talking about it's like it's like with extreme
03:17:08.48 --> 03:17:11.36 ownership we go and work with the company and we check back in with them three months later and
03:17:11.36 --> 03:17:15.36 they're like oh yeah this is working this is awesome and it's the same thing we're getting back
03:17:15.36 --> 03:17:20.24 you know when I hear from clients you know this is the best hire we've had oh yeah we we were worried
03:17:21.12 --> 03:17:29.36 and now we're promoting I think it's just like a totally it as we often say it works this stuff works
03:17:29.36 --> 03:17:34.16 and you take these individuals and I know Mike you and I've been talking about this and I know it's a
03:17:34.16 --> 03:17:39.68 little bit hard to do but we're some of the guys that we've placed we're going to get them on the podcast
03:17:39.68 --> 03:17:44.08 so they can talk about not just their military experience but then what it was like going through
03:17:44.08 --> 03:17:47.84 we if Overwatch and now what it's like entering this civilian world you know we're letting them get
03:17:47.84 --> 03:17:53.12 settled in a little bit before we get them back to fly out to California and do this but I think
03:17:53.12 --> 03:17:56.24 it'll be awesome for people to start to hear those stories and get that feedback
03:18:00.24 --> 03:18:06.16 when people want to engage you if Overwatch towards the process so they can go to the website
03:18:06.16 --> 03:18:11.92 efoverwatch.com another thing we we do with companies is we are here as a talent advisory
03:18:11.92 --> 03:18:18.40 we can come in and basically set the foundation based off the playbook we've provided so you have
03:18:18.40 --> 03:18:24.48 a hiring process from which to grow and that's probably the greatest service we can provide
03:18:24.48 --> 03:18:29.60 beyond just finding the right leaders for your organization that's critical there's a lot of
03:18:29.60 --> 03:18:33.76 times a George will actually have to ask the client do you have interview questions what
03:18:33.76 --> 03:18:38.24 your process can I send you something to help you make the selection of the leaders we present
03:18:38.24 --> 03:18:46.64 and that's more often than that that talent advisory piece is is key but but if I'm just
03:18:47.84 --> 03:18:54.56 company out there that wants to hire so I go to efoverwatch.com I fill out the various information
03:18:55.20 --> 03:18:59.60 and then we're going to set up a call and you're going to talk with Mike he'll talk to
03:18:59.60 --> 03:19:06.48 myself you may talk with one other person and we're going to really kind of dig in with you as to
03:19:06.48 --> 03:19:10.48 okay let's talk about your company what is your position in the market what are you trying to
03:19:10.48 --> 03:19:14.40 accomplish where are you trying to grow what are your leadership gaps what are your individual
03:19:14.40 --> 03:19:19.12 contributor gaps you know we want to know both of those things you know what are those things that
03:19:19.12 --> 03:19:25.20 are keeping you up at night and then let's talk about how talent and leadership solves those problems
03:19:25.20 --> 03:19:30.72 and are you committed to leadership is the most important thing in your business and you know we'll
03:19:30.72 --> 03:19:35.36 also walk through to find out the maturity of their hiring process and how they've done it because
03:19:35.36 --> 03:19:39.68 you know we we want to make sure that they know how to do because they're mechanics behind this
03:19:39.68 --> 03:19:44.48 as well we've helped with offer letters I've helped with compensation you know structuring complex
03:19:44.48 --> 03:19:48.88 offers which which is not easy for small and medium business to do a lot of times they just don't
03:19:48.88 --> 03:19:54.80 have that expertise so we will sit down and spend a good hour hour and a half with them you know
03:19:54.80 --> 03:20:00.000 diagnosing you know why did they come to us what is it that they need what can we solve for them
03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:04.56 and should we be working together and I'm sorry miss I'm sorry so the the question jocca
03:20:04.56 --> 03:20:08.08 absolutely it's going to be a series of phone calls we want to know everything about your business
03:20:08.08 --> 03:20:12.88 about your industry and a lot of times the reason we do these phone calls because what business
03:20:12.88 --> 03:20:17.84 the leaders think they want is not necessarily what they need and our our job as well during
03:20:17.84 --> 03:20:22.80 that is to advise them based off what we're hearing what we think you really need is x, y, z,
03:20:22.80 --> 03:20:27.52 not a, b, c and our clients have followed our advice and it's worked out beautifully
03:20:27.52 --> 03:20:31.84 what you know we're in that advice is coming from nothing but scars and failures especially
03:20:31.84 --> 03:20:38.56 with 20 years of talent acquisition between him and uh currently so we we want a very very strong
03:20:38.56 --> 03:20:43.28 relationship with our clients if they sign the contract beyond that then it gets into the talent
03:20:43.28 --> 03:20:49.68 sink for what what what a talent sink is for us is we're going to spec out what that position is
03:20:49.68 --> 03:20:55.36 and what are the attributes they're truly looking for from there we we tell him hey we're going to
03:20:55.36 --> 03:21:01.76 need usually two to three weeks to start screaming and assessing potential leaders the the people
03:21:01.76 --> 03:21:06.56 the the right leaders for this position it could be through our organic town pool we're also
03:21:06.56 --> 03:21:11.20 going to run an external search for people we haven't touched yet that maybe out there that may be a
03:21:11.20 --> 03:21:17.04 good fit for that role and that takes time and our clients again we're preaching patience
03:21:17.84 --> 03:21:27.20 we have a pretty darn good fill speed rate to fill and if people allow us to go through our process
03:21:27.20 --> 03:21:32.88 it usually very statistically it works out and they're very good pairing yeah well it's
03:21:32.88 --> 03:21:37.52 like what we do methodical and you know we saw say all the time at S. L. Front what we do is we
03:21:37.52 --> 03:21:43.12 solve problems through leadership and what better way to solve a problem through leadership than to
03:21:43.12 --> 03:21:48.88 actually give a person give a give a company a leader that understands these principles that knows
03:21:48.88 --> 03:21:53.92 how to lead that knows how to step in and make things happen so that's been awesome you have
03:21:53.92 --> 03:22:00.72 over watch dot com I can't we've been going for almost three and a half hours but I real quick
03:22:00.72 --> 03:22:06.96 you have battlefield we just kind of ran our first pilot program and to tell us about that a little bit
03:22:06.96 --> 03:22:13.20 so this besides let me interject that was freaking awesome you weren't a believer first is that
03:22:13.20 --> 03:22:18.16 accurate or that's completely inaccurate I don't know where where why do you think that we
03:22:18.16 --> 03:22:21.92 late when I thought we're like oh juckers not necessarily believe we're he has to see the concept
03:22:21.92 --> 03:22:28.72 personally I 100% of a believer that was a thousand percent I mean you know if you think about what
03:22:28.72 --> 03:22:35.68 I do in this podcast I take I take battlefield strolls through books so for me to go out and walk
03:22:35.68 --> 03:22:41.44 battlefields is to me I would do nothing but that that would be my whole life if I was telling
03:22:41.44 --> 03:22:48.24 you I I got offered a show in Europe to like go and walk battlefields and talk the stories and I just
03:22:48.24 --> 03:22:54.48 couldn't do it it was multiple months of filming and I just it's not happening you know I just can't do it
03:22:55.52 --> 03:23:02.32 but at some point in my life I wouldn't be surprised so yeah I don't know where that idea came from
03:23:02.32 --> 03:23:08.72 that is a data-centric lack of relationship with no-one or boss yeah it's actually kind of crazy to think that
03:23:08.72 --> 03:23:17.76 me that me even with my whole life would not want to go out and walk on bat sacred hollowed
03:23:17.76 --> 03:23:23.36 battlefields and talk about leadership that's yeah so I'm 100% on board and I always have been from
03:23:23.36 --> 03:23:31.68 day one so so where this came from is in 2012 no yeah 2012 with one of my seal squadrons
03:23:31.68 --> 03:23:35.60 the commanding officer especially the timing was not good we were one month away from going to
03:23:35.60 --> 03:23:41.12 Afghanistan and and I'm the operations officer and of course you know the task list of what you
03:23:41.12 --> 03:23:46.48 need to get done before you deploy is pretty deep as an operations officer and I I sort of tried
03:23:46.48 --> 03:23:51.76 to reason with him I hate timing is not good any heard me out and he said my guess what what we're
03:23:51.76 --> 03:23:56.40 going out there leadership development is not optional it's mandatory and so we went out to
03:23:56.40 --> 03:24:02.72 get his bird and of course I'm pouty you know I'm doing my quiet sort of pouty I'm there and as we
03:24:02.72 --> 03:24:08.72 started to walk the different stands the two day walk of get his bird you started to realize that
03:24:08.72 --> 03:24:14.32 the commanders both Confederate Union forces faced the same dilemmas same human dilemmas and
03:24:14.32 --> 03:24:19.36 human problems that we faced in Afghanistan I rack another regions of the world what makes and we
03:24:19.36 --> 03:24:24.72 call this in the military we call these staff rights it is a technique we utilize to develop our
03:24:24.72 --> 03:24:31.12 people again looking at past examples of commanders humans that made both great decisions and bad
03:24:31.12 --> 03:24:36.24 decisions in learning from their mistakes and their successes to make you a better leader
03:24:37.12 --> 03:24:41.76 when you walk and people may say well you know the civil wars drastically different than I
03:24:41.76 --> 03:24:50.16 rack or Afghanistan technology no the problems they face transcend geography they transcend technology
03:24:50.16 --> 03:24:55.04 they transcend time and this is why a lot of businesses do these staff rights we call it you
03:24:55.04 --> 03:25:01.04 have battlefield but what I think we do better than any just sort of history and that takes people out there
03:25:01.04 --> 03:25:06.72 is we tie extreme ownership into it and on this first one the pilot we brought 20 of our clients out
03:25:06.72 --> 03:25:10.16 and I don't know about you I mean they probably don't call you because they don't have your phone number
03:25:10.16 --> 03:25:15.84 but I've been getting text messages from CE the CEOs that route there that this was one of the
03:25:15.84 --> 03:25:20.08 most valuable leadership development trips they've ever taken or you could see it on their face
03:25:20.08 --> 03:25:24.48 this is in the first hour you could see it on their faces they're looking they're taking notes they're
03:25:24.48 --> 03:25:32.56 talking to each other yeah it was just extremely impactful and you know it was a pilot and we're
03:25:32.56 --> 03:25:38.56 going to start spinning those things up yeah if you will keep you posted we'll keep you posted
03:25:38.56 --> 03:25:42.16 and I mean there's going to be limited seats I mean that's just the way it is it's going to be
03:25:42.16 --> 03:25:49.92 small groups but who knows it's freaking it's just an unbelievable way to learn and an unbelievable
03:25:49.92 --> 03:25:57.20 way to develop and an unbelievable way to increase your understanding not just of history not just
03:25:57.20 --> 03:26:04.64 of leadership but of human nature to go out there and see what has happened in our past so it's
03:26:04.64 --> 03:26:13.20 freaking awesome a lot of stuff going on man we do so the book comes out when November 10th so it's
03:26:13.20 --> 03:26:20.88 up on Amazon right now the town or it's right now we just have the ebook the Kindle version the

03:26:26.08 --> 03:26:31.84 naughty a book ultimately though the book launches November 10th which if I need to educate you
03:26:31.84 --> 03:26:37.68 you know November 10th is you don't need that to give me a bro the Marine Corp birthday no coincidence
03:26:37.68 --> 03:26:45.60 George any any closing comments here you know this is it's been an interesting journey to
03:26:45.60 --> 03:26:51.76 write this book and it's it's it's very serendipitous to find somebody who has the same passion
03:26:51.76 --> 03:26:58.64 for talent that I have and and so you know I hope that Mike and I got the best out of each other in this
03:26:58.64 --> 03:27:07.04 book push each other and really proud of what we've delivered here because ultimately it's about
03:27:07.04 --> 03:27:13.28 helping companies just get better and win and and and I'd like to think we did a pretty good job of
03:27:13.28 --> 03:27:20.08 of giving them a good roadmap the talent is the most critical thing that you can focus on
03:27:21.36 --> 03:27:27.84 any closing thoughts Mike no check we're trying to get better we're trying to build a better team
03:27:29.60 --> 03:27:35.36 echo Charles this any recommendations on how we can get better interesting thing about
03:27:35.36 --> 03:27:42.32 what we've been talking about is like yeah you guys talk about you know these are things
03:27:43.36 --> 03:27:48.96 to to look for you know and as far as hiring and stuff but on the other side of the coin like if
03:27:48.96 --> 03:27:54.88 you're looking at get hired hired it's like a good information resource to be like okay that's
03:27:54.88 --> 03:28:01.28 what I'm gonna strive for you know very interesting anyway it's for striving for stuff
03:28:01.28 --> 03:28:12.64 stop about Jaco feel for striving really transition well yeah so Jaco feel how should I say
03:28:12.64 --> 03:28:20.64 assortment supplementation items the ones that stay on my mind which I noticed like I don't
03:28:20.64 --> 03:28:27.76 so much think that much about milk really yeah that's interesting you must be not not wanting to
03:28:27.76 --> 03:28:33.84 bit be stronger well here's the things not that I don't take milk all the time I don't think about
03:28:33.84 --> 03:28:39.60 it all the time but I do think about joint warfare krill oil and vitamin D for some reason I
03:28:39.60 --> 03:28:44.16 don't know why I feel like because it's like an everyday maintenance thing and when I stop
03:28:44.16 --> 03:28:50.88 taking it that's when I pay the price harsh here's my question to you yes do you know what that
03:28:50.88 --> 03:28:56.88 price is like have you felt it because you don't really go after it or I don't I don't go off
03:28:56.88 --> 03:29:03.92 it yeah so I don't know the price yeah I do yeah so basically like you know like okay all right
03:29:04.32 --> 03:29:08.64 let me turn my attention over here so you know like sometimes like you okay maybe you're feeling
03:29:08.64 --> 03:29:15.44 weak or whatever right but as far as your joint skill you can feel strong but your joints are like
03:29:15.44 --> 03:29:20.32 jammed up that's almost in a way worse than being weak because if you're weak you're like oh
03:29:20.32 --> 03:29:24.96 maybe any eat good maybe whatever but if you're joint it's like it's a it's a different issue
03:29:24.96 --> 03:29:31.28 seems saying is a good news get back on the joint warfare get back on the krill oil you just
03:29:31.28 --> 03:29:36.24 feel all that stuff just flying back into your joints then you're back in the game then we start
03:29:36.24 --> 03:29:42.64 feeling good about it real good by the way so and I know this too because I have gone off it
03:29:42.64 --> 03:29:48.88 and gotten on few times and yeah so I know the price and I know the benefit do you are you able
03:29:48.88 --> 03:29:57.44 to make these assessments because you're a doctor no okay well my my explanation of the joint
03:29:57.44 --> 03:30:03.04 warfare in krill oil flying back into your joints was we'll say a little bit short of a medical
03:30:03.04 --> 03:30:11.52 explanation as far as how I'm not a doctor either yes I know that but I've done also of a very
03:30:11.52 --> 03:30:19.52 intense medical assessment of of vitamin B3 and cold war and here's the assessment
03:30:20.80 --> 03:30:25.52 I've traveled all over the place I've shaken hands with a bunch of people I have not had this
03:30:26.48 --> 03:30:33.60 disease called COVID for some reason could that reason be right okay that reason be
03:30:34.32 --> 03:30:40.80 because I'm on the D3 and the cold war no I'm not saying it is because I'm not a doctor
03:30:40.80 --> 03:30:46.56 no but you know you know there's there is such thing as coincidence then there's such thing as
03:30:46.56 --> 03:30:51.52 correlation and then there's such thing as causation you seem saying the three levels
03:30:52.72 --> 03:30:58.56 hey that's it we'll leave it at that how about that cool safe right yeah just saying we're talking
03:30:58.56 --> 03:31:03.12 earlier about you can only ask certain questions in the interview or not so much you can only ask
03:31:03.12 --> 03:31:09.20 you can't ask certain questions that's very correct actually to deviate from the the
03:31:09.20 --> 03:31:15.04 Jockel field thing for a second isn't it a lot of the times the case where the interviewer
03:31:15.52 --> 03:31:21.36 is kind of in a way like wanting to bond with a person just on a maybe on just a small level like
03:31:21.36 --> 03:31:27.44 hey oh wins the baby do yeah and it's like oh I jam that up like I really like you know it's like it's
03:31:27.44 --> 03:31:32.72 not like they're trying to like enforce powers something like this no I mean the best
03:31:32.72 --> 03:31:36.24 interviewers are always trying to build a relationship because one of the critical things you
03:31:36.24 --> 03:31:39.68 want to get out of people is authenticity yeah that's one of the biggest things and the best
03:31:39.68 --> 03:31:44.96 way you do that is by building a relationship and to your point that person may come in they may
03:31:44.96 --> 03:31:50.08 not come into your company so yeah they do and most of those things are done with malice they
03:31:50.08 --> 03:31:57.28 have an accidentally but you know in today's litigious society even accidental scary that will get
03:31:57.28 --> 03:32:02.32 yeah and see that's why it's so like yeah like scary for real scary because it's like man
03:32:02.32 --> 03:32:08.80 it's one thing to be like hey that was a dick move for me to do that so I'm not going to do that
03:32:08.80 --> 03:32:12.88 anymore you know well how about I just not be a dick in the interview oh problem solved right
03:32:12.88 --> 03:32:17.28 here's the thing problem's not solved because you're getting sued yeah because I can be well in that
03:32:17.28 --> 03:32:22.16 case yes but as far as from a learning perspective or from just a general functioning perspective
03:32:22.16 --> 03:32:25.36 now I'm be like how about that so I'm gonna be real nice how about that I'm gonna bond with this guy
03:32:25.36 --> 03:32:29.12 mean what you're like you know lying what you call minefield landline field one of those
03:32:29.12 --> 03:32:34.88 you're walking on eggshells and whatnot yeah which kind of isn't a very good bonding approach yeah
03:32:34.88 --> 03:32:39.76 you're walking on eggshells yeah then you you kind of get you know your seaming personal your
03:32:39.76 --> 03:32:46.16 risk of vests you know so you know as we teach veterans any good interview is simply a
03:32:46.16 --> 03:32:52.16 conversation it's ultimately what it comes down to and you know when we work with veterans it's just
03:32:52.16 --> 03:32:58.24 hey man be yourself be authentic you know but put it in a vernacular of extreme ownership and talk
03:32:58.24 --> 03:33:04.08 about how great of a leader you are just have a conversation and that's it's simple not easy
03:33:04.08 --> 03:33:10.24 and I love that phrase late later to laws are not always a good thing not all of them are great
03:33:10.24 --> 03:33:16.56 and that's a profession in itself yeah yeah it's just part of my profession is you know that
03:33:16.56 --> 03:33:21.28 training you know ultimately training keeps people safe right that's what it does yeah that's one of
03:33:21.28 --> 03:33:24.80 those situations where you can be mad about it you might not like a particular law but it's
03:33:24.80 --> 03:33:30.000 the law and you got to you got to just deal with it that's just the way it is so you never know
03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:35.12 people could be made it can claims like medical claims about things about supplements and you could
03:33:35.12 --> 03:33:41.04 run into all kinds of legal problems you which he just did there but hey if you're waging war on
03:33:41.04 --> 03:33:49.04 colds various sickness illnesses viruses etc you don't know to name any is there a metal
03:33:49.04 --> 03:33:55.28 quote is that a medical claim real easy maybe not unless these are the things that you do want
03:33:55.28 --> 03:34:01.92 to follow so what's that called like a caveat or no it's not a caveat is it caveat yeah like
03:34:01.92 --> 03:34:12.64 a dislike yeah just here's my disclaimer I'm not a doctor yeah so don't listen to me yes
03:34:12.64 --> 03:34:18.96 well or just listen you know yeah how about this listen to joc what about that okay we'll go with it
03:34:18.96 --> 03:34:23.52 we'll stick with that the mind that I'm not a doctor yeah Johnny Kim doctor
03:34:23.52 --> 03:34:30.000 joc go on no doctor keep these all these things in mind no last yeah vitamin vitamin D daily
03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:35.20 daily man these are things that you know again to stay on your mind I'm not saying don't keep
03:34:35.20 --> 03:34:44.88 milk on your mind I'm not saying that I'm saying me personally in my experience D3 joint warfare
03:34:44.88 --> 03:34:51.12 or not whatever these are the things that okay we have these two-pronged effect let me move my
03:34:51.12 --> 03:34:55.92 attention over here to my pros so you have long term you have short term right and every once
03:34:55.92 --> 03:35:00.56 a while you'll get a golden nugget that's both that's what milk is seem saying a lot of these
03:35:00.56 --> 03:35:06.32 health foods they don't have the immediate gratification as heavy as a lot of these unhealthy
03:35:06.32 --> 03:35:11.44 things I see them saying I do sure milk is one of those rare golden nuggets the other one is
03:35:11.44 --> 03:35:19.60 sushi my opinion but back to milk it's dessert in the form of health food or protein health food
03:35:19.60 --> 03:35:25.52 in the form of a dessert boom either way you're good there you go either way it's true also discipline
03:35:25.52 --> 03:35:31.76 multiple forms multiple forms there's your intrinsic discipline that you go through life with that
03:35:31.76 --> 03:35:35.52 comes from within you know they're not talking about that one right I'm talking about this
03:35:35.52 --> 03:35:42.64 implementation so yes okay what is it what is the three forms you got the powder that's a good one
03:35:42.64 --> 03:35:47.60 that's a good pre workout one I like this first pre workout like I dig a like a pre life
03:35:48.16 --> 03:35:52.48 yeah by the way it was so hot this weekend out here with you have your intensive soap I know
03:35:52.48 --> 03:35:59.68 it's hot there but I mixed up the jockel pomer in the big iced tea like pitcher with ice in it
03:36:01.04 --> 03:36:06.08 cooked those are you out yeah you go feel
03:36:10.08 --> 03:36:15.44 also the the cans okay here's what the cans are really really
03:36:15.44 --> 03:36:26.16 it's a health brain health drink right so it doesn't sound glamorous right think of it it's a
03:36:26.16 --> 03:36:35.52 brain and body health drink okay in the form of a delicious refreshing beverage
03:36:36.16 --> 03:36:40.000 beverage you want to say different times I was gonna say energy drink but then then you got all the
03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:43.68 what you call the what you call it when you have a reputation a word has a reputation
03:36:43.68 --> 03:36:50.32 a freaking stigma has a stigma you seem saying anyway that's what it is so the can is also
03:36:50.32 --> 03:36:54.32 this window okay look we don't want to drink the can we don't want to mix up powders okay I get it
03:36:54.32 --> 03:37:01.44 pop up pill that even has a stigma nonetheless this one's a good way of popping good pills capsules
03:37:01.44 --> 03:37:06.000 technically you know all these forms depending on your lifestyle depending on what you're doing
03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:11.28 that day they can you know at least one's gonna work for you I think my experience that's how it is
03:37:11.28 --> 03:37:15.20 also we got work your kid milk we got chocolate tea and all the stuff is available at the
03:37:15.20 --> 03:37:21.12 vitamin shop we also got if you're gonna get into jjitsu which you might you probably should
03:37:21.84 --> 03:37:29.44 good origin main dot com get yourself a geek get yourself a rash card get yourself things that you
03:37:29.44 --> 03:37:34.48 you can wear when you're not on the jjitsu math's of justice because despite our best efforts
03:37:34.48 --> 03:37:38.32 we're not always training jjitsu sometimes you have to have other parts of your life that's why
03:37:38.32 --> 03:37:43.60 we make jeans that's why we make boots that's why we make t-shirts whatever a bunch of different
03:37:43.60 --> 03:37:51.76 clothing items all that stuff and the supplements available at origin main dot com also we have a
03:37:51.76 --> 03:37:59.68 store jjocco has a store it's called jocco store anyway some good developments and improvements on
03:37:59.68 --> 03:38:05.44 there for those of us that browse jocco store for those of us that are seeking praise for our efforts
03:38:05.44 --> 03:38:11.44 I'm not even saying I'm doing it I'm just saying the store is that becoming more and more developed
03:38:11.44 --> 03:38:16.08 in one person's opinion and I think it's an what he call it an objective
03:38:17.92 --> 03:38:24.80 all right we'll go anyway jocco store dot com go there if you appreciate the developments
03:38:24.80 --> 03:38:30.80 if you appreciate beautiful web design yeah exactly yeah if you go check out web design
03:38:30.80 --> 03:38:35.92 web design yeah well actually technically I didn't really design it you know I got a finger in the pot
03:38:35.92 --> 03:38:44.88 nonetheless as far as these angles nonetheless we supply provide really clothing item that you can
03:38:44.88 --> 03:38:50.000 wear to represent while you're on this path that we're on this path that's not easy by the way I don't
03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:58.08 know if you guys know this or not my can George it's hard it's full of pitfalls temptation traps
03:38:58.08 --> 03:39:02.96 wise men once told me that unless when you're on the path you want to represent jocco store dot
03:39:02.96 --> 03:39:07.92 com and that hoodies shirts hats beanie's shorts board shorts
03:39:10.64 --> 03:39:14.56 at some point the shirts are these week the here's the thing they're not up okay
03:39:15.20 --> 03:39:19.92 but they will prove that they're quite hard and they're not the best it's a process you know
03:39:19.92 --> 03:39:24.48 well what it would it would it would it would make say Mike said something the methodology it's a process
03:39:24.48 --> 03:39:31.68 of all the process trust the process is one of our things anyway quite that okay
03:39:31.68 --> 03:39:36.64 quick to create that into the whole deal and boom you got it anyway yes joccal store the three
03:39:36.64 --> 03:39:42.80 if you want something also we got a podcast record subscribe to this podcast because
03:39:43.52 --> 03:39:49.44 echo thinks that you're not going to we also have joccal unraveling which has been on this
03:39:49.44 --> 03:39:54.64 feed it's going to soon be on its own feed joccal unraveling podcasts it's myself a darelecoop
03:39:54.64 --> 03:40:00.40 but that was the thread we had to change the name because I was getting sued again which is always
03:40:00.40 --> 03:40:05.84 fun so that's why it's called joccal unraveling because I own my own name jocco so I can pretty
03:40:05.84 --> 03:40:10.000 much put that on anything and no one can bother me about it grounded podcast we haven't done
03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:14.48 the while maybe record one more this week we have an opportunity warrior kid podcasts as well
03:40:14.48 --> 03:40:18.32 for those little kids out there and if you got little kids or even if you're a grown human
03:40:18.32 --> 03:40:25.92 and I need some soap go to irishokranch.com where young aiden the warrior kid is making soap
03:40:25.92 --> 03:40:31.04 there's a no one out one or the warrior kids still you made warrior kid so like actual
03:40:31.68 --> 03:40:41.68 so not just you as an adult but also your children you too we have a youtube channel
03:40:41.68 --> 03:40:47.12 where echo makes videos and if it's a form in a video he puts a bunch of explosions in it
03:40:47.12 --> 03:40:51.60 and if it's a for our video then it's just nothing because that's the way he operates
03:40:51.60 --> 03:40:58.72 different purposes videos yeah it's cool all right okay we're we're talking about
03:40:58.72 --> 03:41:08.48 effective hiring processes leadership right Mike Shirley George should we put explosions
03:41:08.48 --> 03:41:15.92 smoke and fire in this video occasionally in this in this video that we do that we're doing
03:41:15.92 --> 03:41:20.64 right so it's making at some point when you're talking about something it would it not be
03:41:21.52 --> 03:41:29.20 a good thing to have maybe a black off helicopter fly overhead or a minigun open up
03:41:29.20 --> 03:41:34.08 or an explosion happened in the background echo I'm gonna back you up on this you know you
03:41:34.08 --> 03:41:40.000 ask anyone on the ear for watch team and say what don't I do they say we don't do cute so
03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:45.44 I'm not talking cute bro I'm talking minigun I'd be over the top I think you're hitting
03:41:45.44 --> 03:41:51.12 down the right I think you're right but here's the thing and this is for real if I'm like hey
03:41:51.12 --> 03:41:58.24 if I get moved inspired and I got my notes here I don't have my note here also you're you're
03:41:58.24 --> 03:42:03.68 starting to take it under consideration no I'm saying I'm explaining I have my notes here
03:42:03.68 --> 03:42:08.000 and maybe I was moved by something George or Mike said right I have my note to be like okay look
03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:13.60 if I could isolate what they said and try my best to capture the feeling that I got when you said
03:42:13.60 --> 03:42:19.52 it maybe put my can cut that up into a little video that might involve explosions the
03:42:19.52 --> 03:42:28.16 effects me too much like a certain financial uh tv host mad money oh yeah this is get
03:42:28.16 --> 03:42:39.04 a lot of the money yeah yeah yeah good good comparison I think it's my opinion anyway yes
03:42:39.04 --> 03:42:44.48 some videos have explosions a shorter ones whatever and the video version of this podcast
03:42:44.48 --> 03:42:50.000 but we're keeping it wrong I don't even add color and you want me to add a mini gun opening
03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:56.24 up I don't know probably not I don't know though I could be wrong anyway also psychological
03:42:56.24 --> 03:43:02.56 warfare if you didn't know what that is that's an album that joker recorded with tracks each track
03:43:02.56 --> 03:43:09.28 has a purpose and it gets you past these moments a weakness on this path that we're on in the
03:43:09.28 --> 03:43:13.44 event of you being on the path which of course we all are in the last hundred percent effective
03:43:13.44 --> 03:43:18.72 on the one by the way so yeah you can get that amazon or like a google play anywhere where you can
