I think statements like that are like what get kids or if I say kids, but like when I meet kids, like I've just met at this event, we were just at, and this, you know, he's like, I'm 19. You know, she can't say guys up like, well, well, you know, I went on patrol the day, got to help with help with kid tie a shoe, you know, and like that gets old and then what'd you do? He had four firefighters also for telling the towers 5k they do in New York City and they also, they partnered with Gary Snees and they built houses and things like that for guys that have been through traumatic injuries and they were like, hey, we're gonna have a 5k and September, we'll push you and I'll walk it and they're like, well, yeah, but like, we'll push you as no big deal. And you know, when that guy like that gets hit, one, obviously frustrated and angry, you don't know why it happened, but two, it's like, well, geez, if he didn't get hit or taken out, you know, it kind of takes you down to confidence a pegrot, pegrot too as well because he's a guy you wouldn't expect. I'm like, I know you, uh, think you're not going to go, but you better jump out of this plane and you're like, you know, and I said, I told you you were going and then back with shirt back with pants. So deep that was eight foot deep pits and there was a living room, uh, two, 40 pit, a 50 cow pit, um, uh, like a little dying kitchen area and then like three sleeping pits, like three like that two cops would fit in. Also, YouTube, if you like the video or want to watch the video version of this podcast, see what Travis looks like, see what Jockel looks like, see what I look like if you're into that. And I think if you're if you're calling home every day, then you're like, you're you're missing and you're connecting and just like, no, like you said, let it build, have something to talk about real, and what does that get to know? And then they were said we're going to go there for like, you know, three days, do reconnaissance come back and they're like, you know what we're going to say there. And they were right from I had a lot of tests I had to do for like, you know, a possible age idea or things like that because it was just like they were just taking and putting it right in. And then a little bit goes to like four scumboards like with 10 a day and like, no, what the hell, you know, why did I live through this? A lot of guys didn't come back like me and I get sometimes people like, well, we just didn't see people like you during the Vietnam where it just had so sad this happened. I didn't want to like, my brother and I was like, you got a call, you know, Kelsey, you got a car and mom and dad. And the other thing was, I didn't like doing a PLF, which is the proper way to land, which is you keep your feet knees together, and then you like act like you have one big leg, and that's the way you're supposed to prevent getting injured, break in your ankle or knee or whatever. I mean, later on, that point, we had like stakes on like one day a week, they'd bring out like these frozen stakes. Um, um, that one of the guys on the MetaVac bird, like, wrote a wrote a Facebook to Kelsey and was explaining, you know, what it was like and and, uh, yeah, I mean, here's what he wrote. But what I liked about that from like a broader perspective than just airborne school is like so often, man, people just need to like go. Just like what, like glucose, I mean, could it was all like, basically all the stuff that you have been taking four years. And so, and you know another thing is, you know, you got all this stuff going on, and then your wife's like, you won't believe this What is it like a little, uh, former like like house or something? Well, turns out where we were rolling all of our, like, big barrels for the generator and stuff like that was like, it was all booey trap. I'm like sergeant major, if I change the pants, I'm like another pair of looks just like this. And I'm just like, still jack from looking at the weights and I'm like, you know, you're not going to look at my kid. And then I was like watching the silver wets above me, they're like, pull your reserve bells and they're like, okay. I was like to give people that didn't serve a little, you know, impression or of what it's like and I thought this wouldn't wrap that up pretty good. You know, not even like, you know, it's nutsax hanging off the light and is, you know, but he's just the truck's not hurting. But like a lot of guys in the military, you're young, and you're like, you know what, we're getting married. They called the blue book in the army, but it's like, if I die, you know, I want my reddering, I want picture of my life and I'm a kid or, you know, I want this music to play. where but I got it, so I took my weapon off, and I am for, you know, as I hear, hold this for me, I tossed in my M4, because there's just, you know, it gets in the way, you know, I ran down, and then the A and A were on the riverbank, right, kind of right behind me. You know, but, you know, at that time, I guess, maybe it was easier for me to like think about everything else going on except for myself. He's like, he told his mom a day, he's like, look, I know how it looks. So, we decided, me and two other guys, three other guys, we're going to head just like, try to head and walk faster, and everybody else, and like, made it back to the fob first to get a, get a m wrap to come get them. What we shot through all my rounds one, and one of the things we shot through all the 7, 6, 2 rounds, was like, oh, this is so much like lighter, and I got to another spot, and one of my, my guy's Brandon, Feste, we've won the guy's with me later on, but he was almost knocked. He's like, well, no, I just, you know, because I, I'm on the five all the time, I just, I mean, I love, I want to see a gun, you know, I hope we're getting a firefight. We, you know, luckily we didn't take the property to, you know, I'd like to, I think after the march, that guy's got it. But, um, the first, like, you know, five, six months, I was just like, no lights at this time. So it'd just be really, you know, so we're like trying to put our uniforms on and everything and said like just our t-shirts. But yeah, it wasn't like, everyone that was joining the military, it's not like when you guys joined, your generation of people joined, you knew you were going to war. You know, the wide eye, like, oh, no, it's like, that's not okay. I don't know why, you know, you said there any question like, am I going to be a burden on my family? Yeah, and they were like, yeah, we had like a Marciac guy got shot in the head when he was up there. And then finally like an October I was home for Thanksgiving and North Carolina at my house at Fort Bragg and I was just like, you know what? You know, like, oh, I'm all holding her in that or something like I can't drink. But, you know, a lot of questions are, you know, when you're sitting in the hotel room, I mean, a hospital bed, you know, in the hospital room and you just got started to see me all the time. And I was like, oh, you must be a dumbass, you know, I'm like, I am. It's like some movie that that six, I don't know what that is, but they're like, if Dream Amy the man I am today. and I said something along those lines and like somebody said like, I think it's kind of weird that you say it's a good time and fun In my gym, we'll be like, oh, yeah, well, you know, while we'll meet 23, you know, oh, That's not like, it's like, you know how you say when you when you pick up a person and they're just dead weight, similar to that. You know, the Colin home thing, I think is, is, I don't know how often you call to home, but I try to call them like once a week. But you're just, you know, say it like, hoping to get shot, but you're just like, well, that's part of what happens. After I first firefight, like two of the guys that came from a different after unit were like, look, I didn't get while you were the squad leader, I didn't get how you got E6. And you know, by like we taught her like seven to my nine o'clock, she's tying it by herself. You know, like, you could easily marry like Satan.
