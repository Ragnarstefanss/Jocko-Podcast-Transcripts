00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 146 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I wanted to kind of delve into and slash explain some conversations that I've had lately.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Sure, with a couple of people and actually I think the numbers increase now because now I've had this conversation with a few people.

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I'm feeling like I need to kind of share this idea with kind of with more people, I guess at this point.

5
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's kind of a discussion that applies to everyone at some level.

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Sort of about what you are and about who you are and about where you've been and about where you're going.

7
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So that's a pretty broad topic. I think it suffice it to say.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Yeah.

9
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now in order to convey this properly, I'm going to try and set up some visuals in your head.

10
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Could you kind of kind of see this, right?

11
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Graphs, whatever charts, all right? Diagrams and I'm going to try and keep them simple but pretty straightforward.

12
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Here we go. We're going to grade things.

13
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We're going to grade things one to ten because that's sort of the standard.

14
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I guess you go ABCDF.

15
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Yeah, but we're not doing that.

16
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We're going one to ten, one being the worst, ten being the best, one being the least, ten being the most, that type of thing.

17
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Okay?

18
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So you have a chart.

19
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Picture in your head at the bottom of the chart is a one.

20
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's the lowest.

21
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That's the worst at the chart.

22
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This ten.

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That's the highest.

24
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That's the most.

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Now the first chart that we're going to talk about.

26
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It measures talent.

27
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now what's different about this chart is this is not just talking about a particular talent.

28
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This is talking about every possible type of talent that you as an individual human being have and it's consolidating that all those different types of talents.

29
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
That's a lot of talents into one.

30
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Giant score.

31
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
One holistic score.

32
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Ten.

33
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
At the top or one at the bottom.

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So this is.

35
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is everything that you are as a person.

36
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
How smart you are.

37
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The only the only thing is everything you are as a person that you are given naturally.

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Right?

39
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So there's a baseline of how smart you are.

40
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So how intelligent you are.

41
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now we know you can work.

42
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's smarter, but we're just talking the baseline.

43
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
How.

44
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
How charismatic you are as a person.

45
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
How well you read people's emotions.

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
How athletic you are.

47
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And that grades you can grade all different types of athleticism in there.

48
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
What strength?

49
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Because some people are naturally strong.

50
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Some people are naturally flexible.

51
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Some people have natural cardiovascular endurance.

52
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Right?

53
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You get a certain level of that naturally.

54
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Of course we know people can work hard.

55
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You can improve some of that.

56
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But we're just talking your natural talent.

57
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Healthy.

58
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
That's sort of a talent.

59
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Sort of like some people are born healthier than others.

60
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
No doubt about it.

61
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
How good looking you are.

62
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
You ever seen those little.

63
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Like I don't know if they're psychological experiments,

64
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but they put like the faces and from the babies.

65
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And like the babies pick the the one that looks nicer to them.

66
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It has to do with.

67
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Sameetry.

68
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Sameetry and ratios and stuff like that.

69
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So so that that's a talent thing that you're getting.

70
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And naturally your natural body composition.

71
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Right?

72
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Some people are born a little bit with a little bit more fat on them.

73
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Some people are born with a little bit muscle on them.

74
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Some people are born with.

75
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
No skin and bones right?

76
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You get everything.

77
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Yeah.

78
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Again, I know you can work on some of those.

79
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But we're talking about what you got out of the gate from.

80
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Your creator or nature or whatever you think you got it from.

81
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Yeah.

82
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So.

83
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
At the top of that chart.

84
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I don't know who's at the top of that chart.

85
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Uh, maybe.

86
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I mean, there's people.

87
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There's there's a bunch of people that would crank towards the top of that chart.

88
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Mm hmm.

89
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So.

90
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Who's up there?

91
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Well, yeah, ultimately hard to tell because you know what.

92
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
You know what was given to him or what's working for.

93
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But you know, to look at him, you know,

94
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
to just just someone as a whole.

95
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Yeah.

96
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I don't know like the rock character.

97
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The character.

98
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The rock.

99
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The rock character is Maddie.

100
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
He's a good athlete.

101
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He's tall.

102
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
He's he's got a good acting skill, which, again,

103
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Did you work hard for these things?

104
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
We better to we better give the rocks and credit over here from the park.

105
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
From all that.

106
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But hey, he's given some natural stuff.

107
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
That's a very good one.

108
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Uh, Tom Brady.

109
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Right.

110
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Yes.

111
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
He's smart.

112
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
He's a good athlete.

113
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
He's.

114
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
You know, got some leadership skills.

115
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So he's got some.

116
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Some.

117
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Some natural gifts that again.

118
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You know, the hard.

119
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We're not taking that away from him.

120
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But you're born with some stuff.

121
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
GSP maybe, right?

122
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Just be really good athlete.

123
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Smart guy.

124
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
You know, level headed.

125
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You know, just a he's a very talented guy.

126
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So there you go.

127
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
You take that chart.

128
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You look at that chart.

129
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
But one to 10.

130
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Where's the where?

131
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
There's the rock.

132
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
He's like a nine point six.

133
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
He's up there.

134
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Yeah.

135
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And then you ask yourself where you on that chart.

136
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And I'm asked quite a few people this and we're still talking naturally.

137
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We're just talking what you got naturally.

138
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Where do you think most people?

139
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Where would you rank yourself?

140
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Naturally.

141
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
If I don't know five.

142
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Oh, most people rank themselves.

143
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Most people that have asked to rank themselves a little bit higher than that.

144
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
They've ranked themselves six point eight.

145
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Seven point two in that.

146
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
They're giving themselves a little bit above average.

147
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Right.

148
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
You're going five, huh?

149
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Well, keep in mind.

150
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We just said the rock.

151
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So I'm like, all right.

152
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yeah.

153
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Yeah, that's true.

154
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
You know what we should have done is we should have said one to a hundred.

155
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So you could say the rock is a 96.

156
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
That's still be a 50.

157
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Okay.

158
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Can I do it?

159
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Yeah.

160
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
All right.

161
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So you give yourself five.

162
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So that's good.

163
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And I'm sure we could break that down about where you got the because some people.

164
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
This is important.

165
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Some people can be a 10 or a 9.8.

166
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
For their intellect.

167
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
But maybe they socially don't have good skills about reading.

168
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
They weren't born with that little thing.

169
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Right.

170
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So they can't read people well.

171
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So even though they're really smart, they're not making anything happen.

172
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Because they can't even communicate with people well.

173
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Or they're just they're not healthy.

174
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Right.

175
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
They're bad athletes.

176
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Some people the opposite.

177
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
We could good athlete.

178
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
But they're just not that smart.

179
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Right.

180
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And everything in the city.

181
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You could you could be a 9 athlete.

182
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But you're a.

183
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
A very low.

184
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Whatever intellect and that's going to bring you down.

185
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Might even bring you down below average.

186
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So so you got that chart.

187
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And that's it.

188
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Okay.

189
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So now we got that.

190
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It's the holistic talent chart.

191
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
That's what we'll call it.

192
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We got the holistic talent chart on one side.

193
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Now in your head, I want you to picture on the other side.

194
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The other side is another chart.

195
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Also one to 10.

196
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
One being the least 10 being the most.

197
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And this chart is to grade success.

198
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Now.

199
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
This is not easy to do because of course you can ask yourself what is success.

200
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Right.

201
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
What is really being successful.

202
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And this is a good question.

203
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And I remember I don't know if you remember that.

204
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
When people started to ask me a lot about like how to raise your kids.

205
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And I said, well, I don't want to talk about how to raise kids.

206
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Because I don't know if I'm a success.

207
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I don't know if my kids are successful.

208
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I don't know if I should be giving that advice.

209
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Because what if my kids aren't successful?

210
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And when I started talking about that question, it's like, okay, water.

211
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
If my kid, if one of my kids goes and get a job at an investment bank and is making

212
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
$450,000 a year as a 26 year old.

213
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Is that successful?

214
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It could be, but what if that kid is miserable?

215
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
What if that kid is doing cocaine?

216
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Right.

217
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
That's not successful.

218
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
That's horrible.

219
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So it's very hard to.

220
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So that makes you start thinking about what is success.

221
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But I think we can generally know and understand what success probably is when you look

222
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
at these individual categories.

223
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Right.

224
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So, okay.

225
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Good family.

226
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Right.

227
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
You've got a good stable scenario going on with your family.

228
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
If you're old enough to have a family, if you're not old enough to have a family,

229
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
at least you are prepared to have a good family life.

230
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Right.

231
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
That type of thing.

232
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
That's one level of success.

233
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
You're not a ratifying job.

234
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Meaning a job that, because you can, I know people that make a ton of money in their job

235
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and they hate it.

236
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Yes.

237
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Right.

238
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So that's successful.

239
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Mmm.

240
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Maybe not.

241
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I know people that love their job but they don't make any money.

242
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And they're struggling paycheck to paycheck.

243
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Does that, is that success?

244
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Mmm.

245
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I don't know.

246
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Again, these are all things we could kind of weigh out.

247
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Mmm.

248
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And then you've got health and wellness because even though we talked about what you're

249
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
given naturally, you got to remember that you think you can work for something.

250
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And you can be successful and be healthy and be mobile and be not worried about getting out

251
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
of breath when you walk up the stairs or whatever.

252
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So the overall health and wellness.

253
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And so again, you have to take all these different types of success, all of them.

254
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And wrap them up holistically and I don't know.

255
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Can we throw and this might be the wrong.

256
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
You could possibly throw kind of a strain.

257
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
You could possibly throw just the whole word happiness on to the situation.

258
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Right.

259
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
This, the general term happiness where I, but I think that's a scary thing to do.

260
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Mmm.

261
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Because happiness isn't necessarily a good thing.

262
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
In terms of you meet someone that's had a few beverages.

263
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And even though they're alive, so does ask your man there having a good time at the bar.

264
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And they're pretty happy.

265
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Is this, this is our goal?

266
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Not really.

267
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
That's why I think happiness is a, I don't know that I would throw it into this chart.

268
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I would call it success because it has a little bit more strength to it.

269
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Mmm.

270
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Now, you got your, you got your two, you got your two charts now.

271
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Mmm. On the left, you have holistic talent.

272
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Is that what I called it?

273
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Yes, holistic talent.

274
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Holistic talent on the left.

275
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
On the right, you have holistic success.

276
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Success.

277
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Now, here's the question.

278
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And I could ask you where you are on the success side.

279
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Yeah.

280
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Where are you?

281
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Oh.

282
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Seven.

283
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Oh.

284
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Okay.

285
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Good. Good.

286
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
So you were a five for talent and you're a seven for success.

287
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
That's pretty, that's pretty legit.

288
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Let me ask you this.

289
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Is every person, that is at the top of the talent chart,

290
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
holistically with everything they've got is every one of those people that scores a nine point eight at the top of the success chart.

291
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
No, no, no, no.

292
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The answer is no.

293
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Is every person that's on the bottom of the talent holistic talent chart on the bottom of the success chart?

294
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
No, the answer is no.

295
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And what do we see?

296
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We see that there's a, well, when you put the space in between these two,

297
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
there's talent, holistic talent, and there's holistic success.

298
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And there's a space in between.

299
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And that's what actually matters.

300
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
What do you do?

301
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
What do you do?

302
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The thing, and to me, and I hate to get.

303
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I hate to throw this out there.

304
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But for me, the thing that's in between the left and the right, the thing that's in between talent success is,

305
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
can be summed up in one word, discipline.

306
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Do you have the discipline to do the work to make the hard decisions to put in the daily grind that's going to get you from wherever you started out with whatever level of talent you had and move yourself a bat chart on the right hand side?

307
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I think it's important to recognize this.

308
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And this conversation, this particular conversation of the first time I had it, was with a younger person who I could see in their eyes had the sense of like, I don't know if I have the talent.

309
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And it's like, well, you know, I don't know if you have the talent either.

310
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
There's one way to find out.

311
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
You do the hard work.

312
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
You implement discipline on your life.

313
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And that will give you the opportunity to see how far up that success.

314
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000
One thing I can tell you, if you don't have the discipline and you don't do the work, you're not going to be above your holistic talent level at all.

315
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
There's some people that make a run for it, man.

316
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
You know what I mean?

317
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
There's some people that have no talent or very limited talent, but they get after it.

318
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And they end up way off far on the success.

319
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And or you know what I think is good about this, when you get some success, you kind of compound that back into your hard work and people start to get on an upward spiral upward mobility towards the top of the success chart because they got a little foothold.

320
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Once they got that foothold to feel good, then they take another step, they get a little bit further.

321
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And then they get a little a little bit more success boom.

322
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And then they use that to propel themselves up a little higher.

323
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
The problem is the reverse happens as well.

324
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
That's the problem.

325
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
People feel a little bit of they got beat at something.

326
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
The bad luck came the way.

327
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Because you know what?

328
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
On this in between, there's some luck in between the discipline.

329
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
There's absolutely some luck as well.

330
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
There's some luck.

331
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And you can get lucky.

332
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
You can meet the right person at the right time.

333
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
You can you can make a move at the right time before anyone else did.

334
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
You can you can get discovered by someone or something.

335
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
You know, there's definitely some luck involved.

336
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
For sure.

337
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
You can't count on the luck.

338
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
The luck is not the reason.

339
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Some people like to look at someone else and say they're lucky.

340
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
They didn't see the thousands and thousands of hours of hard work that person put it.

341
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
They just saw that last little end result where they got lucky,

342
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
allegedly.

343
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Yeah.

344
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Yeah.

345
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
The luck thing is weird because if you can extrapolate it out like someone who

346
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Okay, when I played football, we had to do these cool shirts.

347
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And they say something on the back with a front.

348
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I don't know whatever.

349
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Oh, and it says chance favors.

350
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
One of them said chance favors the prepared man.

351
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
True.

352
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So it's like the same thing.

353
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Right.

354
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Chance and luck.

355
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Same thing.

356
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So you'll like the more prepared you are, the more skills you have,

357
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
the more whatever.

358
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
The quote unquote luck you're going to get.

359
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
But really when you switch the word luck for chance, you just increase your chances of success.

360
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
True.

361
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So like, you know, I don't know who got discovered.

362
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
You know, there they're going to be in a position to be discovered.

363
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Yeah.

364
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
You know, because whoever quote unquote discovered,

365
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I'm sure many people have been in that situation too.

366
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000
You know, like, you know, some guy goes on the news, right with his baskets that he makes,

367
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
you know, whatever.

368
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And boom, he blows up because those baskets are dope.

369
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But brand planning people have been on the news with your thing.

370
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
You know, for years, decades, centuries may be a woman.

371
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
That's actually, but, you know, for like, not two years, actually, let's go.

372
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
People can go in on the news with their thing for a long time.

373
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Yeah.

374
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Same thing with American Idol.

375
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
A lot of people been on American Idol.

376
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yeah.

377
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yeah.

378
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Seems like how many people really made it right.

379
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
You know, as far as getting discovered or whatever, like, oh, yeah, you got lucky.

380
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Whatever.

381
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Yeah, man.

382
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
But you're not going to get lucky if you're, if you're kind of whack, you know, if you're, you're not prepared.

383
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
If you're, you don't have the skill, you don't have the talent, you don't have the X, Y, Z.

384
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
That it takes.

385
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Then yeah.

386
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So it's kind of like, yeah, the luck is sprinkled in there everywhere, by the way.

387
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
You know, and maybe they didn't get discovered on the news.

388
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
But maybe they went to somewhere else, and then got discovered, you know, a year, two years later,

389
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
or whatever, you know, so you just increase the probability being discovered when you have the skill.

390
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
So yeah, luck.

391
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Sure.

392
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
It is part of it.

393
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
It is a thing for sure.

394
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
But yeah, it can propel you a little bit faster sometimes.

395
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Yeah, but it's, it's like one of those things where you talk like a foothold, right?

396
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
There's a bunch of, it's, footholds everywhere, just because someone latched onto one specific one that everyone's a point to and say he got lucky there.

397
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Well, he's so good, or she's so good.

398
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Most of the time, most of the time, his exception.

399
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Most of the time, most of the time, most of the time, that person's so good, they wouldn't got discovered somewhere else anyway.

400
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
It's just a matter of all this particular one, made them get discovered and propelled them all quicker, whatever.

401
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Yeah.

402
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Well, this ties back into something that I've said before, and I'll say it again right now, is make your luck.

403
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
You, you got to make your luck.

404
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And if you make it, if you keep, if you keep putting forth the maximal effort, that luck is going to come.

405
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
You're going to make your luck happen.

406
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:36.000
You know, that, you know, that actually, when we came, when tasking a bruiser came home from Iraq, there was, you know, people like all he got super lucky on that deployment because we got a lot of action, right?

407
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And there was two like immediate thoughts behind that was number one like, hey, you know, first of all, we lost our bros like there nothing lucky about that was the first immediate thought in my head was like, hey man.

408
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Because the bottom line is seals want to go into combat.

409
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Bad.

410
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And that's just the broad statement.

411
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And so when we came home had been in a lot of combat and killed a lot of bad guys and people were kind of saying, hey, you guys got lucky.

412
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And again, the first thought was, hey man, you know, if this is luck, I don't want it.

413
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
The second thought was just like the same thing.

414
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Like, oh, we got lucky. We didn't like crush ourselves and the work up and try and be the most, you know, prepared we could be and then get overseas and then form relationships with all the conventional forces and do good work for them and continue to, you know, just get go as hard as we could the whole time.

415
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
No, that didn't have anything to do with it. It was just luck and it kind of fell into our lap.

416
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
But you know, of course, just not your head and say thanks man, appreciate it. Yeah, good times.

417
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:55.000
So luck is definitely a part of it a little part because where we was I lucky to be in Ramadi because I could have deployed a year later and a year later, Ramadi was passed by. So is there luck there?

418
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
They're absolutely is.

419
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
So I don't want to sound arrogant, but luck is a part.

420
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
It's like foot locks. It's like heal hooks.

421
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
They're a part of the game. They're not a game changer.

422
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:21.000
We had a group come in. This is back in the day. A group came in. A guy's that were known for foot locking and heal hookin.

423
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And what they didn't they thought we were a GG2 guys normal.

424
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
GG2 guys, but we weren't because we were D.

425
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
So we were foot locking, heal hookin all the time.

426
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And these guys came in and immediately they were going for these kind of guys that would go, and I don't know if you remember this time period in GG2.

427
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
It was like immediate they're going for a foot lock, like just diving for it.

428
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
But they didn't know that we did foot locks all the time and you weren't going to just grab a foot lock on Dean, Lester, or me.

429
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Like that, this wasn't going to happen.

430
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And it kind of, then it also, and they didn't have the rest of GG2.

431
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
They had the rest of the game. So then it was not good for them because they only had this one dimensional game.

432
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And that's what taught me that foot locks are important, but they're not more important than a choke or a guard pass.

433
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
They are definitely part of the game. You can't leave out, but they're not a game changer.

434
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And you see that now, now that you see everyone broadly getting good at the whole leg locking foot locking, heal hookin game.

435
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Now you see it coming back around where you have to have the rest of GG2 as well.

436
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Like even as much as like a year ago, it was like, oh, this guy got this crazy heal hook in the guy tapped and you didn't know what was happening.

437
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
That very rapidly changes into, okay, the guy went for a heal hook, the other guy got out.

438
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Now we got to back where we back to, we're back to the GG2.

439
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
So same thing, luck is a factor, it's not the factor.

440
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
All right, now that's number one. This is the number one thing I wanted to talk about today.

441
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000
If you're in that position where you're looking at your talent, and I guess this is, I guess it's applicable to people that are a little bit younger,

442
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
because people that are a little bit older, they probably figured this out already.

443
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
You probably looked at yourself in the mirror and said, hey, look, I might not have that much talent,

444
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
but I can get after it. You know, it's something you say about basketball too.

445
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And I know you want to basketball, but I play basketball, growing up.

446
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And when I was growing up, it was like the hey day of the lakers and the Celtics rivalry and all this.

447
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Well, the hard work, right, just this like, hey, I'm going to work harder than anyone else to make up for my lack of talent.

448
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And they would say about Larry Bird, you know, Larry Bird is, yes.

449
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
They would say, this is kind of garbage, say Larry Bird wasn't athletic, which is total garbage.

450
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
I mean, but people would say that, and maybe it's because they didn't have the biggest vertical jumper, whatever.

451
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And they'd say he was like slower than other players, but he works so hard that he was able to compensate for that.

452
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Now again, when I heard that when I was a kid, I kind of believed that when you see Larry Bird now,

453
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
when I watched, you know, games, he was he's a freaking awesome athlete.

454
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
You know, and you're not playing in the NBA and being a world champion over and over again MVP without being an awesome athlete.

455
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
How tall was Larry Bird? How old is he?

456
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
How tall? He was like, six, eight.

457
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
He was a little tall guy, everybody was kind of in his mud web, who's like five something.

458
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Yeah, yeah, mud web for sure.

459
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
There is that, yeah, man. I did get there and remember this.

460
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
The mud web probably had to work harder to make.

461
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
What about there's a guy named, I think his name was Muggsy Bugs.

462
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
You remember Muggsy Bugs? He was now he was even smaller than his mud web.

463
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
But he was so small that people, it was a different little situation that the players had to deal with.

464
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
He was so small, so fast.

465
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
You know what's interesting? I got some friends in hockey and as a matter of fact, the goals, the goals.

466
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
The goal. The San Diego goals.

467
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

468
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
So I went down and talked to the goals.

469
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
And what's cool about what's cool about that level of athletics, which is the minor leagues,

470
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
the goals are a minor league team.

471
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
What's cool about that level of athletics is those guys are hungry.

472
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
They're not prima donas that are driving around in a chauffeur car and all that stuff.

473
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
These guys are hungry and they're playing hard.

474
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And what's interesting is in hockey. And this is within the last few years.

475
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
At one point, a few years ago, they were just getting the bigger and bigger and bigger hockey players.

476
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Just getting bigger guys because you're just, just monster guys that are 6, 6, 6, 5.

477
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
And 6, 4, and they weigh at, you know, 260.

478
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
And that was the way hockey was going.

479
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
But then what happened was they started bringing out these guys that were smaller and faster.

480
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And that could go maneuver quicker than the bigger guys.

481
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And all of a sudden, hockey's going back in that direction of smaller, faster guys.

482
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
So it's interesting.

483
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And the amount of talent that that employees, hey, figured out,

484
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000
you can make something happen, mugsy bugs, spud web, make it happen, regardless of height.

485
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000
But to my point, Larry Bird, when I was a kid, I would hear about Larry Bird not being a good athlete.

486
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And all you had to do is work hard.

487
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Which left me an impression on me as a kid.

488
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Hey, look, Larry Bird's not that great athlete, but he's got work hard.

489
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
So we asked what I'm going to do, work hard, work hard, go.

490
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Oh yeah.

491
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
They said about Dan Gable too.

492
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Yeah.

493
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
The wrestler.

494
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Hey, maybe not the fastest.

495
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
But his thing was, oh, I'll outwork them all.

496
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
You ever heard stories about him?

497
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Dan Gable?

498
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Yeah.

499
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
He would just run from every place he would go, he would run.

500
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Oh, no.

501
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
From the class to class in college, from class to the cafeteria, he'd run everywhere.

502
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
So hard work.

503
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Now, okay, so that wraps up.

504
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
We got talent on the one side.

505
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
We got success on the other side.

506
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And that's cool.

507
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
And we know that we can progress up that chart for the young people out there.

508
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And even the old people out there.

509
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
If you're on the lower end of that chart of the talent chart,

510
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
boom, work hard, apply discipline, make good decisions.

511
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
You can end up further.

512
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
You can order the top of that success chart.

513
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Boom.

514
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Now, we're going to get away.

515
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I guess we're going to get away from the holistic success a little bit here, maybe not.

516
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Maybe, maybe not.

517
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
This is a conversation that I've also had.

518
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And it had primarily with two two people that I know pretty well, one of them very well and one of them

519
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
decently well.

520
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And this is the conversation.

521
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
These two individuals.

522
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
High talent.

523
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
High in the talent chart.

524
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
So what does that mean?

525
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
They're smart.

526
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
You know, they've got that personal interoperability with other human beings on top of that

527
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
super driven on top of that.

528
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
They've got the whole work thing too.

529
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
They've got the discipline thing down too.

530
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
They've got all that.

531
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
They're maxed out in the game that they're playing.

532
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
So what do I mean by that?

533
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Insucker.

534
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
How many goals can you score?

535
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Let's say you're the best team.

536
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
You're the best player on your team and you're going to play a season worth of soccer.

537
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
How many goals can you score?

538
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
No, we'll season.

539
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
I don't know how many games do you see?

540
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I don't know.

541
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Let's call it.

542
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Let's say you play 15 games.

543
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
So you're going to.

544
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
I don't know.

545
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
45 maybe 60 goals.

546
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Okay.

547
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
That's clear.

548
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
We're going to realistic.

549
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
We'll take it.

550
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
15, 33 goals.

551
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
45.

552
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Yeah, we'll go.

553
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
This guy gets a hatrick which is a rarity in soccer.

554
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
We'll say he gets it for every game for a 15 games season.

555
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
That's where he ends up.

556
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
He ends up at 45 goals.

557
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
We'll totally watch kids soccer.

558
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Okay.

559
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
My numbers are my peel off.

560
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
A little bit.

561
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Okay.

562
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Now what if you were a basketball player?

563
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
How many goals can you make in basketball?

564
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
You're going to game.

565
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
You know, realistically on the high end, 21 points.

566
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Then you multiply that time to season.

567
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
And you obviously can score way more in basketball than you can in soccer.

568
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Clearly.

569
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
This is where again, I've had this conversation primarily around the financial aspects of

570
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
work for people.

571
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
If you get in, you have to look at the game that you're playing.

572
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Because sometimes the game that you're playing in soccer.

573
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
And it doesn't matter how much talent you have and doesn't matter how much hard work you,

574
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
you put into it.

575
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
You can only score 45 goals and that's it.

576
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
And meanwhile, someone that maybe doesn't even have the talent and doesn't have the work ethic

577
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
that you had, but they're playing a different game and they're scoring 200, 300, 400 goals.

578
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
They're making two, three times as much money as you.

579
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Why?

580
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Because the game that they are playing.

581
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
So you have to look at that every game just about.

582
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Well, I'll say every game that you can play has a cap on it of what you can actually make.

583
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Until you get to the top and you look at it and you change your angle.

584
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
You change your angle of the game.

585
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
You could say I'm going to create a new game.

586
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
You could get really good at soccer and say, you know what?

587
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I've maxed this game out.

588
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I'm going to create a new game where it's a smaller field than a bigger goal.

589
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
You know, you could do that.

590
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And people do that in industry, right? People do that in industry.

591
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
They get to the top of their game and they start a new game, a different game.

592
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
They change the rules a little bit when they can score more.

593
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
I'm totally supportive of that.

594
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:58.000
The problem is, I just want to make sure that people recognize that sometimes you've put in awesome.

595
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
You're a very talented person.

596
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
You've put in a lot of work.

597
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And you got to the, you got to the, you, you, you capped out your game.

598
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
You're going to get as many goals as you're going to get. That's it.

599
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And so you can't get frustrated.

600
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
I'll tell you what.

601
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I was in the Navy.

602
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
I was in the Navy.

603
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Did get everyone.

604
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:27.000
I was in, I retired as an O4E over 20, which means, which means I was a priori, unless the guy, you can go look at what my salary was.

605
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
And then you can add my little specially pays in for jump dive demo, special duties.

606
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
And I'm in pay. You can add those little things in there.

607
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
You can add my beat, officer housing, basic allowance for housing in there.

608
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
You can figure out. I mean, it's, you're going to make this much money.

609
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
That's it. That's the cap.

610
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Yeah.

611
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
That's what you're going to make.

612
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Now, now we start to talk about, can you play multiple games at the same time?

613
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
And the answer to that is yes, you can.

614
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
You can play multiple games.

615
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Now, I kind of, I kind of said this on a different podcast.

616
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Somebody talked about, you know, having a side hustle while you're in the military.

617
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000
And I was like, well, no, you can't really do that because, you know, you've got to focus 100% under job.

618
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
And then, but the reality is, I had a side hustle a whole time I was in.

619
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Because I guess what I was doing, I was buying houses.

620
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
I was saving my money. I was driving 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan.

621
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
And I was buying a house here. I was buying a house there.

622
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:40.000
And that's, when you have a, when you have an alternate job or an alternate game that you're going to play in the military,

623
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
it's okay. It just has to be on a complete, not to interfere basis.

624
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
So, doesn't interfere occasionally if you're, if you've got a few properties and one of them has a broken water heater,

625
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
you can mitigate that by making sure you got a good property manager and making sure you know the right handyman.

626
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
I can go over and square that stuff.

627
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
We can get that problem solved. I had some kind of catastrophic situations.

628
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
I had the big flood.

629
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
So, the big flood.

630
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
No, a slab, like, a little cracked pipe in the slab.

631
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
I had a crack, one of my rentals has flooded twice.

632
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Wants from the ceiling, wants from the ground.

633
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
How does it flood from the ceiling?

634
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
From the ceiling, crack pipe upstairs.

635
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Upstairs bathroom, crack pipe somewhere.

636
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Boom, drip, drip, drip. Next thing you know, you've got water damage.

637
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
The other one pipes run through the slab because something goes wrong or whatever.

638
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
And that thing starts to leak.

639
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Tenants don't say anything for a long period of time.

640
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Even though here in their hand, squished, squished, squished under the, under the, the flooring.

641
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
They don't say anything. Guess what? Everything's ruined.

642
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
You've got to come in.

643
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
You know, so, what do you do with those catastrophic situations?

644
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Well, if you've got the right management team in place,

645
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
get tangled.

646
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Get tangled. Make the phone calls.

647
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
People get it taken care of.

648
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
You don't have to worry about it.

649
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
So, you can do that.

650
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
It's got to be on a not-to-interfue basis with your primary job

651
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
if you're in the military.

652
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
And really, it's the same thing if you have a primary, you know, you've got your primary job.

653
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
You're working for someone. You're doing nine to five.

654
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
You don't want to interfere.

655
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
You want, you want your side alternative gig

656
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
to be on a not-to-interfue basis

657
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
with your primary gig.

658
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Now, the other thing that you can do.

659
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
And this is where you start to look at, okay, because you, you, you, you, you, you play in games.

660
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
You're playing these different games because you want to move yourself up on the success level.

661
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Sometimes you have, and I see people do this and some people do this really well.

662
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
They have one game that they're playing to make money.

663
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000
They have another game that they're playing to, you know, to win in their health, right?

664
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
They're doing marifons.

665
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
They're, they're, they're jack and steel. They're, they're doing jujitsu.

666
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
They've got another game that they're playing to get some sort of gratification out of life.

667
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Some kind of positive gratification out of life.

668
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Whether they're working as a volunteer, whether they're donating time to the soup kit,

669
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:12.000
whatever you're, they're doing, they're doing something that's giving them some gratification that they're moving the ball forward for humanity.

670
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000
And that's, that's, that's a good thing in my opinion.

671
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
So sometimes I think someone's, they're, they're, they're losing their soul because they're working a job to make money.

672
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
They don't like it. They're not healthy.

673
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And they, and they feel like they're just giving all their time to the man.

674
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
What should that person do?

675
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And that's the situation.

676
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Find some other games that you can play to.

677
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Find some other games.

678
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Find a game to take care of your health.

679
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Find a game to take care of your family.

680
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
I mean, you know, for, for family, right?

681
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
How do you, what game can you play to take,

682
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
make sure you get the family unity that you want?

683
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
There's all kinds of things that you can do, right?

684
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Whether it's camping, whether it's vacation,

685
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
whether it's going on rock climbing trips, whether it's everyone going to do jujitsu,

686
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
whether it's you're doing a 15 minute PT in the morning, whatever.

687
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
But there's, there's some games that you can play to get that side of things.

688
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
So there's all kinds of these various,

689
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
will call them games that get played.

690
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
But what I find, this is the whole point of this conversation.

691
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
What I find is people aren't aware that they're in a specific game.

692
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
And that game has limitations in that game, has rules.

693
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
And if you don't recognize that, you're going to play that game,

694
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
and you're going to keep playing that game, soccer game,

695
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
and you think you're going to get more goals.

696
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
They're not coming because you can't do it.

697
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
That game is limited in someone's right.

698
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
So what you have to do is you have to either change the game,

699
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
or you've got to find a new game to get into.

700
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
If you're young, look at what game you're going to play,

701
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
and figure out how you're going to win in multiple games

702
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
so that you can move yourself up on the success.

703
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Holistic success chart.

704
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Sure.

705
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
So there you go.

706
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
That's the first thing I wanted to talk about today.

707
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Number one.

708
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.000
This second thing I wanted to talk about is Connor versus Kabib.

709
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Okay, so Connor versus Kabib.

710
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000
And once again, this I realized, I think the only other time we've talked about a fight

711
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
in on this podcast was another Connor fight.

712
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
I think it might have been Connor versus Nate.

713
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
So why are we talking about this fight?

714
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Well, there's just two major reasons.

715
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Well, there's three major reasons I guess.

716
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Now, one is, was it the biggest fight of all time?

717
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And you have seen it possibly was.

718
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
I don't know.

719
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
What do you think?

720
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

721
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
It's hard to compare now because, yeah, I would say,

722
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
no, I would say, yeah, because the fan base is probably bigger than it's

723
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
ever been. Yeah, just overall. What about the hype behind this fight?

724
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
No, I felt like, well, then again, I don't know, that could be my bubble.

725
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Okay. I didn't hear as much about it.

726
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
I heard a lot about it for sure.

727
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
I didn't, but I didn't know which one did you hear more about.

728
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Just a John Jones, some of the John Jones fights.

729
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
I remember.

730
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Yeah. And then also like some of the Brock Lesnar fights.

731
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
I remember thinking like, dang, there's just you.

732
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Here's what I think.

733
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
I don't know.

734
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
No, no, no, no.

735
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
I was a Jose Aldo. Jose Aldo and Conrad Gregory, that might have been bigger.

736
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Yeah.

737
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
And they did more tour. They did the big press thing.

738
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Here's though.

739
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
I think that people had a better handle on what could happen

740
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
in the Jose Aldo fight.

741
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
I think people didn't know what was going to happen in this fight.

742
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Yeah.

743
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
What's funny is, for me, I was wrong, by the way,

744
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
but it was the opposite.

745
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
I thought, oh, Jose Aldo's going to beat this guy up.

746
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Really.

747
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
And then actually this one I thought could be was going to win too.

748
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Yeah.

749
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
So that's let's get to that then.

750
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
All right.

751
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I sent out a tweet, which I normally, you know, don't,

752
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
and so I sent out a tweet.

753
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Here's the tweet.

754
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Here's the tweet that I actually sent out.

755
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
It was to the notorious MMA, which is Conrad.

756
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
I said, stay outside the first three rounds.

757
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Don't over commit strikes.

758
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Mostly jabs.

759
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Get booed by the crowd.

760
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Doesn't matter.

761
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Fustrate could be force bad shots, tire him out in the fourth,

762
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
start stepping up the striking in the fifth, let it go,

763
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
and finish him.

764
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Good luck.

765
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
John Cavanaugh at John Cavanaugh.

766
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Tagged his coach.

767
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Because his coach, well, okay, no,

768
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
people are going, okay, well, why are you rooting for Conrad, my

769
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Gregor?

770
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And some people went like a little crazy.

771
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Like, why are you when he's a bad,

772
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
sets a bad example for the sport and all that.

773
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
So actually the reason is because I've communicated with coach

774
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Cavanaugh, a decent amount on Twitter and little DMs and all that.

775
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
And just, you know, he just has been kind of like a cool guy.

776
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
And here he was going into coach, his fighter in the biggest fight

777
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
of Conrad's life.

778
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And, you know, just because we've had that little

779
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
conversation, we've had conversations on Twitter a bunch,

780
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
and we've just just threw that out there, like two hours before,

781
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
I mean, we always watching the first fights when I threw that out there.

782
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And you know what the really funny thing is,

783
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
John Cavanaugh texted back or he tweeted back,

784
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
copy.

785
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
So he actually read it and responded, which is pretty crazy.

786
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
So anyways, because I have had a little interaction with Coach

787
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
John Cavanaugh, I felt like, you know,

788
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
hey, I'll throw this out there.

789
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Also, you know, Hans is like boys with Conrad, right?

790
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And Hans is my boy.

791
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
So I was, you know, that association.

792
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
There's association.

793
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
You know, I'm going to be like, hey, Hans is my boy.

794
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
And he has been for a long time.

795
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
And he's bros with Conrad.

796
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And so I just, you know, like, again.

797
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
So people are, why did you why you voting for this guy when,

798
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
so there's that whole thing.

799
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And now the, the other odd thing about this is,

800
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
you have a striker versus a grappler.

801
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Who do I root for in a striker versus a grappler?

802
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Grappler.

803
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
I always root for the grappler.

804
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
And I know that factually and statistically,

805
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
the grappler has the advantage because grappling versus striking

806
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
the grappler wins most of the time.

807
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
How can you go the distance with this argument?

808
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Sure, you can took it all the people that all the times that

809
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
a striker is actually a good grappler.

810
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
And then they don't use their grappling,

811
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
but they use their grappling only to defend from being taken down.

812
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Chuck Ladell.

813
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
And there's a bunch of, there's countless guys that you can now name that

814
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
knocked people out and we're known for their stand-up,

815
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
what they really were and their base was that they were good

816
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
restaurant going to be taken down.

817
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
So, but generally striker versus grappler,

818
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
the striker, and this is what I talk about from a self defense

819
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
perspective, right?

820
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
If you're a good striker, then that means you can run away.

821
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And if you're a good grappler once you get a hold of someone,

822
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
you can defeat someone that has good striking.

823
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Here's the thing that people understand.

824
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
In order for you to punch someone, you have to get close enough for them

825
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
that where they can take you down.

826
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
You have to get into their take down branch.

827
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
They have to get into the red zone.

828
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
So once you're in the red zone, you can get taken down.

829
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000
So, how do you defeat that as a, as a striker,

830
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
how do you defeat a really good grappler?

831
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
The way you do it is by, what I just said, you stay on the outside.

832
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
You touch person up.

833
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
You don't over commit to it because the harder you know this,

834
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
how many rounds have you done of MMA sparring?

835
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Countless.

836
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Okay, me too.

837
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
So, when I would be going against a striker,

838
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
the harder they throw at you, the easier it is to take them down.

839
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
All day long.

840
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
And when I'm going against a wrestler that I don't want to get taken down against,

841
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
like I used to do this to Dean, then just frustrate them.

842
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
You know, not commit to any punches, not throw any kicks at all,

843
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
sit there in jab and run away for basically two or three rounds.

844
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
And even Dean, who's a far superior wrestler to me,

845
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
he would have a very, very hard time taking me down.

846
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Yeah.

847
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
So, this is a legit strategy.

848
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
The reason I know it's a legit strategy is because people have used it against Dean.

849
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:46.000
When Dean was fighting MMA, people used that particular strategy against him.

850
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
And it worked.

851
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
And so I know the strategy works.

852
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Guys that Dean was infinitely better on on the ground.

853
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
And yet he couldn't take him down.

854
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And he was infinitely better at wrestling.

855
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Why couldn't he take him down?

856
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Because they weren't playing that game.

857
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
They weren't playing the MMA game.

858
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
They were playing the Amida jab you and stay away.

859
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Now, a couple of things also,

860
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Conner's attitude, Conner's, what do you want to call it?

861
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
His, his, his, the way he behaves, right?

862
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
He's un-sportsmen-like and he's a trash talking all about.

863
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
I get it.

864
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Number one, he's, he's trying to sell fights.

865
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Like, we, we, is he a very confident, perhaps an overconfident guy.

866
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
But actually maybe, but if you ever see this work ethic, it's freaking solid.

867
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
He's always respectful after loss.

868
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
So when he loses, he, he, he is respectful.

869
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
And he says, hey, good job.

870
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
You got beat, you know, he doesn't, he's not, he's not a sport loser.

871
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And he's a hard worker.

872
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
And do I wish that he would be able to be a little bit differently?

873
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
I don't, yeah, I mean, it's, it's him.

874
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
It's another thing is, that's him.

875
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
You know what I mean, that's him.

876
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
And you can't expect guys that are going to do what he's going to do for

877
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Living to behave the way that you want them to behave.

878
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
It's the same thing with guys that are in the military, right?

879
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
You can't expect a guy that's going to go put his life on the line to be, as, as

880
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Kippling says, a plaster saint, right?

881
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Doesn't happen.

882
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
You got a guy that you want to go kill people and you want him to,

883
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
put his life at risk.

884
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Guess what?

885
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
He's going to get a little crazy sometimes.

886
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
And as a leader as a, even as society, we have to look at those guys.

887
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Go, okay, look, we'll give you a little bit of room.

888
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
We want you to stay in the box here.

889
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
We don't want you to get out of control.

890
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000
And that happens all the time.

891
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Military guys get in trouble all the time.

892
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
They get out of the box.

893
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
But you got to give him a little bit of room.

894
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
If you, if you didn't want that type of person,

895
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
you would have known and then, well, you would have a very few people in the military.

896
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
And the problem that's attitude is, you know, hey, I'm a saint.

897
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Well, I guess what a saint doesn't want to go hunt people down and kill him.

898
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
A saint doesn't want to get in the mud and blood and guts and be in that situation.

899
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
It's very similar with fighters.

900
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Now, are there fighters that do behave in an idealistic way?

901
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Sure, absolutely.

902
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Are are.

903
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Is that preferred?

904
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Sure, that's great to see.

905
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I won't prefer it.

906
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
I don't know.

907
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
But it's great to see.

908
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
I mean, probably, in my, I want to, I don't know who my favorite fighter of all time is.

909
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:36.000
But Fedor is definitely at the, you know, he's in the top three of just my favorite.

910
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And one of my favorite things about Fedor is,

911
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Fedor showed no emotions ever at any time.

912
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Winner loose the same reaction.

913
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
He mostly won.

914
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
But he would just raise his hand.

915
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Like he wouldn't barely even raise his hand.

916
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Yeah, it'd be like a half or half.

917
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Yeah, it'd be like half.

918
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Just destroyed this person in one $2 million here in Japan.

919
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
And I'm taking the pride of, you know, rush a home with me.

920
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
No big deal.

921
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Yeah.

922
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
I'm going to go with the kettlebell.

923
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Socceraba.

924
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Socceraba is the same way.

925
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Very, and the thing that was funny about soccer.

926
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Again, he's one of my favorite fighters.

927
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
It's soccer.

928
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Robah, the only thing that was, you could, you could hold again.

929
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Socceraba is sometimes he would like clown people almost.

930
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Yeah.

931
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
And he was almost had some of that professional wrestling stuff going on.

932
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Yeah.

933
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
So anyways, uh,

934
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Conner is Conner, Conner will mature.

935
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
He'll get older.

936
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
And that's fine.

937
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
He backs it up.

938
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
He puts it on the line, bro.

939
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
He puts on.

940
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
He doesn't avoid fights.

941
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
I can say that.

942
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
You know, he takes the hardest fights.

943
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
He can possibly find when he, when he lost to Nate Diaz to say,

944
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
I want to fight him again next.

945
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Yeah.

946
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
You know, that's legit.

947
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
So anyways, there was a couple of people that were like,

948
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
straight up, just hostile.

949
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Why are you supporting Conneries,

950
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
A bad sport.

951
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
He's a represent.

952
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
It's like, okay, I get it.

953
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
So there's why John Cavana, Great Coach,

954
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
My buddy Hans, friends with him.

955
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Um,

956
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Yeah.

957
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Now for the actual game plan,

958
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
the actual game plan.

959
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
That I talked about.

960
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Number one, stay outside.

961
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Stay outside.

962
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
You stay outside the range of that person.

963
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
You get just a week and barely touching with a jab,

964
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
and you get ready to sprawl.

965
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Now Conner actually did a good job.

966
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
He sprawled a few times.

967
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
He defended the take down on several occasions.

968
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
He did a good job on the bottom of,

969
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
you know,

970
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Kaby does this thing that Dean does too,

971
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
which is he ties up your legs with his legs.

972
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Kind of like captures him.

973
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
And when you can't pull your legs out,

974
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
when you're up against the cage,

975
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
you cannot get up.

976
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Conner got his legs out over and over.

977
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Over that was impressive.

978
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Yeah.

979
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
So that's the number one.

980
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
You stay outside.

981
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
It's really hard to take.

982
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
You know, even even against someone that's a great wrestler.

983
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Me.

984
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
And I'm not a great wrestler.

985
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
I can,

986
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
I can back up and stay away.

987
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
It's where I'm really hard to take down.

988
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
And so is anybody.

989
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
If you,

990
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
if you're,

991
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
soul goal is to knock it taken down.

992
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Yeah.

993
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
It's actually,

994
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
not that hard to knock it taken down.

995
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Now,

996
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
it changes when you,

997
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
when you start committing to your punches,

998
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
it changes when you start trying to knock someone out.

999
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
It changes when you start getting into a wrestling match with people.

1000
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Then it's easy to get taken down.

1001
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
You know,

1002
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Taylor, right?

1003
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
All the way to take down on Taylor.

1004
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
As soon as we start mixing it up,

1005
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
guess what?

1006
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Getting taken down.

1007
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Because I play his game.

1008
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Can't play his game.

1009
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Okay.

1010
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Next part.

1011
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Don't over commit.

1012
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
What happens when you throw strikes?

1013
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Your weight goes forward when your weight is forward.

1014
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
You,

1015
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
you can get taken down.

1016
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
That's all there is to it.

1017
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
So you don't want to throw big heavy punches early

1018
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
because that's when the take down is going to come.

1019
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Mostly,

1020
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000
jabs again.

1021
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
That's the lightest punch you're for this to weigh.

1022
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
I wouldn't even throw kicks.

1023
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Maybe a couple kicks,

1024
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
but I wouldn't throw him.

1025
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
He's fast,

1026
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Connors fast,

1027
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
so he might be able to get away with it.

1028
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
But I probably wouldn't even throw any kicks in the first round.

1029
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Maybe start throwing some kicks in the second round.

1030
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
But kicks again.

1031
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Kick,

1032
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
take time and a well-time shot.

1033
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
We'll take you down on a kick.

1034
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Can you chop at the legs?

1035
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Yeah.

1036
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
You can chop at the legs.

1037
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
I can have a big negative impact on the person you're fighting.

1038
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Getting boot, right?

1039
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Why did I say get boot?

1040
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
The reason I said get boot is because if you're doing this strategy, right?

1041
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
People are mad at you because they think you're avoiding the fight.

1042
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
They think that you're not being aggressive and they're going to get mad.

1043
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
The crowd is going to hate you.

1044
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
And that's just what you got to deal with, right?

1045
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
When your crowd is frustrated and annoyed at you,

1046
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
guess what?

1047
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
So as you're opponent.

1048
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
So now your opponent starts getting frustrated and taking that shots.

1049
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
That shots.

1050
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Be careful.

1051
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
And when that opponent is taking shots that are outside the zone,

1052
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
you basically have to be able to put your hands on someone through the most part in order to get a good shot and take them down.

1053
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
When you're outside that zone,

1054
00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:02.000
there's a fraction of a second difference that it takes you to get to the grip on the person that you can stop it.

1055
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
You can stop it.

1056
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
You can't shoot from too far away.

1057
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
And when you get someone frustrated and you're touching them up with jabs and they're getting

1058
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
mad and they're hearing the booze, the crowd, they get frustrated.

1059
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
They start shooting from far away.

1060
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
When they start shooting from far away, you sprawl on them.

1061
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
You put your hands on the back of their heads.

1062
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
You stand back up, you walk away and you make them do it again.

1063
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
You make them do it again.

1064
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
You make them do it again.

1065
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
I said tire amount.

1066
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
And a lot of people were saying, oh,

1067
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Conor's cardio is no good.

1068
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
And that's not a good plan.

1069
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
You're an idiot.

1070
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000
That type of thing.

1071
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
The reason I said that is because first of all,

1072
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
wrestling is for the most part.

1073
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Wrestling is more tiring than striking.

1074
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.000
That being said, if someone's a good wrestler and not a good striker,

1075
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
they're going to get more tired striking than they are wrestling.

1076
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
So you take, you take,

1077
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
caboebe out of his game.

1078
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
His game is wrestling.

1079
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
He's not getting tired wrestling.

1080
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
He's getting a little bit tired.

1081
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000
However, when he shot four times in around and you've defended all of them,

1082
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:08.000
it is absolutely easier to defend take downs than it is to do take downs.

1083
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
It's a lot easier.

1084
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
I mean, we do these drills all the time.

1085
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
In fact, the way that we run the drills,

1086
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
when you're the first monkey in the middle,

1087
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
you're the one that's doing to take downs.

1088
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
When you're more tired,

1089
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
all you have to do is defend the take downs.

1090
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Why?

1091
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Because it's easier to defend take downs.

1092
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
You don't have to work as hard.

1093
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
All you have to do is counter what they're doing.

1094
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
So you take him and you tire him down

1095
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
and counter,

1096
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
counter is not going to get tired while he's striking.

1097
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
He's going to get less tired while he's striking.

1098
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Again, could, could,

1099
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
could counter use and improve in his cardio?

1100
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Sure.

1101
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Sure.

1102
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
I've seen him fade.

1103
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
We've all seen him fade.

1104
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
That's a bad thing.

1105
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
He needs to step that game up.

1106
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
I'd love to look at his training and see where we could fill in those holes.

1107
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
But the bottom line is he's going to get more tired,

1108
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
which he did when he's in a wrestling, grappling scenario.

1109
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Then he does when he's standing up.

1110
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
He looks like he's walking through the park when he's standing up.

1111
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
So you do that.

1112
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
You, you, you, you, that's what you do.

1113
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000
You stand up your tire him out and you don't over commit and let him run out of you.

1114
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Now, some people say, we usually connish and just try to knock him out.

1115
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
There's a problem with that idea.

1116
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Is that great?

1117
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Is it great when it happens to all though?

1118
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Sure.

1119
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
You can't count on knockouts.

1120
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
You can't count on him.

1121
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
When you're throwing knockout punches,

1122
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
guess what happens?

1123
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
You're over committing when you're over committing.

1124
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
It's easy to get taken down.

1125
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
So there you go.

1126
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Now what actually happened in the fight?

1127
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Conner pressed forward almost the whole time.

1128
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Which, which when you press forward,

1129
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
it's easy for a grappler to time, your,

1130
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000
move forward movement and shoot on you and take you down.

1131
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
And, and that's what happened.

1132
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Like I said, he escaped.

1133
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
He escaped from the mountain position.

1134
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
A few times that was impressive.

1135
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
He got, did you see the camera?

1136
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Yes.

1137
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Yeah, the attempt.

1138
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Could be, could be, but had a, a camera on him.

1139
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Yes.

1140
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
legit,

1141
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
a camera now's like, oh, this is over.

1142
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Nope.

1143
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Nope.

1144
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Conner got out.

1145
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
I think Conner got out through brute just like strength.

1146
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
So he got out of that.

1147
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000
He recovered, recovered guard a few times.

1148
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
He freed his legs from those weird,

1149
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000
half guard sort of leg control things that Dean does.

1150
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
He freed his legs from those a bunch of times.

1151
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
He survived fairly well on the bottom in the early rounds.

1152
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
And that's all he needed to do.

1153
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000
If he would have done this game plan of staying away,

1154
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
if he got taken down with one minute left,

1155
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
because he starts don't, then you survived for a minute.

1156
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000
It's okay.

1157
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
You survived for a minute that rounds over and then you get to try again.

1158
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Again, the reason that I know this game plan works

1159
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000
is because it's been used against my fighter, Dean.

1160
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
And, you know, who did Amar,

1161
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
who left, he's a Dean talked about.

1162
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000
He's a Russian guy that ended up like mafia dude or something.

1163
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Hit him, hit him, hit him.

1164
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
But that's what he did.

1165
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Just stay away.

1166
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
The guy was a better striker and don't overcommit.

1167
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
And that's what happens.

1168
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
And you know, what's also weird is people even do this in

1169
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Juditzu matches.

1170
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Yeah.

1171
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000
They do this in ADCC where, hey, if I'm a great wrestler

1172
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
and you're a better at Juditzu than me,

1173
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
and I don't want to go to the ground with you,

1174
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
I just play the patty cake for a while,

1175
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
and then what I do is when there's one minute left,

1176
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
I do one take down, I get two points and then I cover up and hold

1177
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
and I win the match.

1178
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000
So people do this in Juditzu, they do this.

1179
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Another thing that they do in Juditzu,

1180
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
and this is something that you have to work on

1181
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
as a Juditzu practitioner,

1182
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
let's say you and I are training.

1183
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
And you get the take down on me.

1184
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
What do I do?

1185
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Well, I engage with my guard.

1186
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
I start looking for grabbing your arm.

1187
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
I start looking for neck control.

1188
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
I immediately start doing Juditzu with you.

1189
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
If I want to really,

1190
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
I have, there's another, there's a whole

1191
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
another game I can play with you,

1192
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
which is you take me down.

1193
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
I immediately try and get back up.

1194
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Yeah.

1195
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
That's a totally different game.

1196
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000
This fouls up like,

1197
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
I used to not do this with Dean.

1198
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000
I used to not do this with,

1199
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
I do it in Andy now because I have to,

1200
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
because people are going to do that.

1201
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
People are going to do that.

1202
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
When you're in a competition,

1203
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
and someone takes you down,

1204
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
or you get, yeah, you take someone down.

1205
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
If they're not comfortable,

1206
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
if they think you might be a little bit better than normal on the ground,

1207
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
they're just going to try and get back to the feet.

1208
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
And that is a different game than just engaging in Juditzu.

1209
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Yeah.

1210
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Or if they don't like their butt,

1211
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
they're, you know, guys, they don't like it.

1212
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Oh, you'd lay the bottom of your shirt.

1213
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000
So they get taken on, it's like,

1214
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000
you're going to get back up, and that's, if you're not used to that,

1215
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
that is problematic for you on top.

1216
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000
If you, if you allow that situation to happen.

1217
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Yeah.

1218
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Yeah. That's why it's good to train with,

1219
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
I think I said this before,

1220
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
good to train with MMA guys,

1221
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
because that's a lot of the time in the case.

1222
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Unless they're like straight up Juditzu,

1223
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
background guys,

1224
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
but you know, you know,

1225
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
guys who just have essentially,

1226
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
what you call a free style,

1227
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1228
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Kind of style,

1229
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
yeah, yeah.

1230
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
And in a sense, we do Juditzu, yeah, any time I'll train with them,

1231
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
they don't like being on the bottom,

1232
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000
so you're going to get that training.

1233
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
They're big time feeding the hips.

1234
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Oh, you're head away, and they're just trying to get back up.

1235
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Yeah.

1236
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Again, the theme,

1237
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
or the reason that all that have all this stuff in my head,

1238
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
is because it's all about what game are you playing?

1239
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Yeah.

1240
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000
What game are you playing?

1241
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
And, and again,

1242
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Connor, that's one of the things that everyone loves about Connor,

1243
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000
myself included,

1244
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
is he goes in there to fight.

1245
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
And yet,

1246
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
that instinct of going forward all the time against a guy that's a superior restaurant

1247
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
of grappler, which could be certainly is,

1248
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
and like I said, grappling,

1249
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
broadly stated,

1250
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
is superior to striking in a,

1251
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000
in a one-on-one situation.

1252
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Yeah.

1253
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Do you look hesitant?

1254
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
No, I agree with that probably more than you do.

1255
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Okay, because, and there's obviously,

1256
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
and I just had someone hit me up on social media,

1257
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
and I was like, but what if, you know,

1258
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
what if you get punched on,

1259
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
what if the striker can punch you?

1260
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
When you're trying to take them down,

1261
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
it's like that case is gone through.

1262
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
And through can a striker knocks someone out?

1263
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Yes, they absolutely can.

1264
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
They have a puncher's chance.

1265
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Can you rely on that?

1266
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Hell no, you can't.

1267
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Hell no, you can't.

1268
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
What were you going to say?

1269
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Yeah, that's it.

1270
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
I mean, yeah, most of the time,

1271
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
as far as how it has played out.

1272
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Yeah, you, yeah, you can knock the guy out.

1273
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Oh, yeah, for sure.

1274
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1275
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
yeah, yeah, it can happen for sure, but yeah,

1276
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
you just do the you run the statistics

1277
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
no, it's like way harder to plan a knockout on

1278
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
a, on a, unless, photos,

1279
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
were a grappler to plan a submission was way easier,

1280
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.000
really.

1281
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Like yeah, but even in grappling tournaments,

1282
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
the guy will be like, hey,

1283
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
I'm going to go, and I'm going to get this guy in a

1284
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Rural naked choke, that's what I'm going to do.

1285
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
And, against another grappler, by the way.

1286
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
So yeah, it's way easier to plan

1287
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
because it's way more methodical.

1288
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
It's like way less, like, what you call,

1289
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000
like chaotic.

1290
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
No, I'm, and don't get it wrong, like strikers

1291
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:05.16
know how to control their environment. I did it. Yeah, but just the nature of what it is, you know, there's no doubt and

1292
00:57:05.94 --> 00:57:07.44
again

1293
00:57:07.44 --> 00:57:09.44
broadly speaking because

1294
00:57:09.94 --> 00:57:15.82
I am totally pro striking and you have to be able to strike and you're your mojtine your boxing kills

1295
00:57:15.82 --> 00:57:21.56
The better they are the better you are as a human being and I don't know if yeah, I mean if you've ever trained

1296
00:57:21.56 --> 00:57:27.24
If anyone here doesn't believe in striking at all go and train with somebody that's a really good high level striker

1297
00:57:27.24 --> 00:57:34.72
and they will jack you up. Yes. They will jack you up. You will be you will feel like a white belt in your jitsu on the map

1298
00:57:34.72 --> 00:57:41.96
Yes, the only difference is if it's if you talk if you flip a switch and you make it MMA and you can grab hold of them

1299
00:57:41.96 --> 00:57:44.68
Yeah, you can you can all of a sudden you can equalize it very quickly

1300
00:57:44.68 --> 00:57:49.80
That's why you jitsu came about that this way it was not might came about that's why it came on to the scene

1301
00:57:49.80 --> 00:57:53.72
So strong it's because all the striking stuff as awesome as it is

1302
00:57:53.72 --> 00:57:59.32
Hmm, we just saw another example of it on Saturday night. That's what I'm talking about

1303
00:57:59.32 --> 00:58:05.44
Yeah, and I'm not even saying honor is a far superior if Connor is a phenomenal striker

1304
00:58:05.84 --> 00:58:09.56
Once he's on the ground he's on the ground and those strikes don't mean anything anymore

1305
00:58:09.56 --> 00:58:13.44
Barely yeah, especially these guys with like super good grappling yeah, and

1306
00:58:14.36 --> 00:58:19.96
You know they can keep going you know when you gas and was this bowl going to kind of what your strategy was

1307
00:58:19.96 --> 00:58:26.48
If a grappler gases he grappler gases and that goes for anyone in a fight if you gas out your your essentially

1308
00:58:26.48 --> 00:58:32.76
In effect, but so kind of that aside the the the reason that Pete that it seems like oh

1309
00:58:32.76 --> 00:58:35.24
Yeah, all these guys like a Leo Tomachita right

1310
00:58:35.24 --> 00:58:39.28
He was a big one who kind of exploded under the scene and just beat up everyone and he's a karate guy

1311
00:58:39.28 --> 00:58:42.52
Right back, both in jitsu by the way, but no one wants to talk about that part

1312
00:58:42.52 --> 00:58:47.44
Yeah, or even like a chocolate L type character where he's just knocking he straight up knocking everybody how crap

1313
00:58:47.44 --> 00:58:48.44
There's an everything

1314
00:58:48.44 --> 00:58:53.92
Superior wrestler by the way, but so it's one of those things where it's like yeah, if you don't know any grappling

1315
00:58:53.92 --> 00:58:57.88
Oh, yeah, your your chances of success especially as time goes on go go way down

1316
00:58:58.64 --> 00:59:04.22
But most people if they're like primarily striking or striking is there kind of their their success

1317
00:59:04.52 --> 00:59:09.20
You know, that's what gives them success they have to learn even like a

1318
00:59:09.80 --> 00:59:16.32
Few fundamentals in grappling and get really good at them just defensively to start with but if you don't know anything

1319
00:59:16.32 --> 00:59:19.24
Like if you know how to defend the take down that's grappling right there

1320
00:59:19.24 --> 00:59:23.24
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and if you get really good at that then okay

1321
00:59:23.24 --> 00:59:26.44
That's gonna help you a lot but that's grappling now what if you

1322
00:59:27.32 --> 00:59:31.88
Essentially fail at defending the take down meaning you get taken down you have to learn to get back up

1323
00:59:31.88 --> 00:59:38.04
If you don't you'll get held down they're straight up if you don't like take a big strong guy and just a normal size person

1324
00:59:38.04 --> 00:59:42.18
When I know you do put the big strong guy on his back like even in guard

1325
00:59:42.18 --> 00:59:47.94
But he won't get up if you guys like hey don't let him up you won't get up straight up. He and the harder he tries

1326
00:59:48.34 --> 00:59:52.34
The less ability he's gonna have to get up. It's like throwing somebody in the water who can't swim

1327
00:59:52.34 --> 00:59:57.78
Yeah, and like he can't even tread water now let alone swim he can't tread the try as hard as you can

1328
00:59:57.78 --> 01:00:00.74
The harder you try the more it's just gonna not work

1329
01:00:00.74 --> 01:00:05.30
But you teach someone to just tread water. Oh, he'll handle he'll handle it a bit

1330
01:00:05.30 --> 01:00:08.26
But oh, you just learned how to tread water though. You learned how to swim a little bit

1331
01:00:08.34 --> 01:00:10.82
So you gotta learn that stuff and what's nice well

1332
01:00:10.82 --> 01:00:16.62
You need to take this into account is that the UFC rounds are our only five minutes

1333
01:00:16.98 --> 01:00:22.30
So there are only five minutes which means you could see it took it took time

1334
01:00:22.86 --> 01:00:28.54
For Connor's good enough that he's not getting like just caught you you made a quick mistake and get caught

1335
01:00:28.70 --> 01:00:33.66
No, he's making a series of mistakes that take time and then finally they get capitalized on

1336
01:00:33.94 --> 01:00:37.66
If he can make it three minutes on the feet every round

1337
01:00:37.66 --> 01:00:44.58
Man the chances of him getting submitted in two minutes by could be especially when he was made doing good maneuvers on the bottom bottom

1338
01:00:44.58 --> 01:00:46.58
They're not really that good and

1339
01:00:47.70 --> 01:00:52.74
You know, can you make them say can get guillotine that normally happens to the grapple or that's like grappler versus grappler

1340
01:00:52.74 --> 01:00:59.02
I shoot on you you grab the guillotine or I try and post and you doing on mark that usually happens not from

1341
01:00:59.42 --> 01:01:01.42
most of those moves come out of me

1342
01:01:01.42 --> 01:01:07.74
Me engaging in grappling with you not me getting away from you me getting away from you exposes less

1343
01:01:08.58 --> 01:01:14.56
Of grappling submissions unless you do poor mistakes like turn your back then you got a problem

1344
01:01:14.86 --> 01:01:21.94
You're gonna have a problem and I suppose we should also talk about the

1345
01:01:22.78 --> 01:01:27.14
the after situation after the fight and

1346
01:01:27.14 --> 01:01:32.18
You know, Kabib who's normally very stoic and calm

1347
01:01:33.50 --> 01:01:40.82
He lost it he ran out the crowd Connor and I was watching in detail some of these little

1348
01:01:41.42 --> 01:01:46.10
Clips and Connor was getting nuts to let's let's not make any mistakes

1349
01:01:47.10 --> 01:01:54.62
cuz yeah, so and then the guy came in from Connors from Kabib team and soccer punched Connor

1350
01:01:54.62 --> 01:01:58.86
That was Narlie and so what do I think of all that?

1351
01:01:58.86 --> 01:02:01.34
Yeah, it's horrible is it bad for the sport? Yes, it's bad for the sport

1352
01:02:03.94 --> 01:02:06.82
Interestingly Joe Rogan posted that Brendan Schob

1353
01:02:07.58 --> 01:02:14.98
Kind of made a prediction. Yeah, he made a prediction that something was gonna get crazy and that's a that was accurate

1354
01:02:16.42 --> 01:02:18.42
What do I think about it?

1355
01:02:18.42 --> 01:02:25.74
I think it's a bummer. Yeah, this is a bummer. It's a bummer to see. I'm so I was surprised that to see Kabib get crazy like that

1356
01:02:26.58 --> 01:02:28.58
The fight was over

1357
01:02:28.58 --> 01:02:33.18
You could see that Connor was pretty humble and defeat. He was sitting there like hey, all right

1358
01:02:34.18 --> 01:02:41.12
That's a bummer and Kabib got nuts for those moments and I don't know what's gonna happen

1359
01:02:41.86 --> 01:02:46.10
I don't know what's gonna happen in terms of I know they didn't they I don't think they paid him yet

1360
01:02:46.10 --> 01:02:48.98
They didn't pay him is $2 million per

1361
01:02:49.70 --> 01:02:56.62
Yeah, wouldn't that be an athletic commission thing? No. Yeah. It'll definitely be athletic. Yeah, they'll they'll find him they'll take part of his purse

1362
01:02:56.62 --> 01:03:00.02
And that's just money. That's like you know when you pay a speeding ticket

1363
01:03:00.58 --> 01:03:03.82
Yeah, and the state gets the money. Yes. This is the same thing

1364
01:03:03.86 --> 01:03:10.26
So they the athlete Nevada state athletic commission could find him half as person put 1.5 or no

1365
01:03:10.26 --> 01:03:11.74
He made $2 million per

1366
01:03:11.74 --> 01:03:18.06
He could put a mill it they could put the net Nevada state athletic commission could put a million dollars in their pocket by saying

1367
01:03:18.06 --> 01:03:21.46
Oh, you shouldn't have done that. We're finding you. We're finding you half your purse boom

1368
01:03:21.46 --> 01:03:24.54
Here's a million dollars. Let's build a new office center

1369
01:03:25.54 --> 01:03:27.54
Officer

1370
01:03:27.54 --> 01:03:33.46
So I don't know what's gonna happen. It's not good to see that I wish everyone would be better sports

1371
01:03:34.38 --> 01:03:40.30
That would be good. Yeah, but people are super emotional and they have a learn to control

1372
01:03:40.30 --> 01:03:42.30
Their emotions yet

1373
01:03:44.34 --> 01:03:49.30
Which brings me to the third point that I wanted to talk about this week? Sure. What are you gonna say something?

1374
01:03:49.30 --> 01:03:54.42
No, no, I dig it but the there is like a bigger kind of picture here with the

1375
01:03:54.98 --> 01:04:01.14
Inj is so anything that's quote unquote bad for the sport. All right, that's that that is something but there's two elements

1376
01:04:01.14 --> 01:04:04.70
Right there's there's there's the growth of the sport and then there's like

1377
01:04:05.26 --> 01:04:09.22
Promotion of the sport for the people who are in the who are in the game

1378
01:04:09.22 --> 01:04:13.70
It's a bad press is good press any press is good press rather than that economy

1379
01:04:13.70 --> 01:04:18.66
So yeah, the growth of the sport to the guy who doesn't watch MMA because it's so barbaric

1380
01:04:18.66 --> 01:04:22.80
We're watching okay, well the pet is fight, right? Same same event pet is and

1381
01:04:23.26 --> 01:04:28.18
Ferguson yeah, by the way, I like Ferguson that dude's a hard worker. I like pet us too

1382
01:04:28.18 --> 01:04:32.90
Okay, and and I and I definitely like Duke Louis. Yes, my boy my boy

1383
01:04:32.90 --> 01:04:38.70
There was you know, we would be cornering people backstage and Duke Louis was always my me is probably doesn't know anything

1384
01:04:38.70 --> 01:04:41.52
There's probably wouldn't even barely know who I am at all

1385
01:04:43.06 --> 01:04:44.86
But he would always be like super cool

1386
01:04:45.42 --> 01:04:52.06
He's awesome. Yeah, so that fight and pet us and pet us is a good dude, too. You know, I like pet us

1387
01:04:52.62 --> 01:04:54.62
Yeah, really seems like it

1388
01:04:55.02 --> 01:04:59.16
But that was a bloody fight. Yeah, what so and there's bloody fights everyone

1389
01:04:59.16 --> 01:05:07.14
All right guys with the huge gash is what not so okay, bloody fight, right? And so me my brother my cousin we were watching this fight and

1390
01:05:07.14 --> 01:05:11.58
So these guys are just basically punching each other in the face

1391
01:05:11.58 --> 01:05:16.62
Any other in the face bleeding like all over you know like super bloody the kind of where they got to stop the fight

1392
01:05:16.62 --> 01:05:21.82
And like hey doctor check this guy that you know, so he gives you a doctor. Oh, hey timeout while we just clean up blood

1393
01:05:21.82 --> 01:05:26.82
Off everyone. Yeah, it's so like about minute here. Just a white blood off everyone. Yeah, and me and well

1394
01:05:26.82 --> 01:05:32.66
We're just watching like oh whatever like actually it's like there have been more eventful fights than this one

1395
01:05:32.66 --> 01:05:35.38
Yeah, like you'd end it in a you know, he broke his hand or whatever

1396
01:05:35.38 --> 01:05:39.18
And it was and that was considered un-eventful I broke his hand. Yeah, yeah

1397
01:05:39.18 --> 01:05:43.30
I'm watching the guy in the head. Yeah, they stopped the fight and that was un-eventful

1398
01:05:43.30 --> 01:05:48.34
We consider that un-eventful and eventful fight is a guy who gets knocked out unconscious flat out

1399
01:05:48.34 --> 01:05:51.46
Which with it will be chapping by the way if you fight really anyway

1400
01:05:51.46 --> 01:05:56.02
Yeah, so we're watching this blood everywhere. I mean while we're like okay, you know like whatever

1401
01:05:56.02 --> 01:06:00.42
But so that my point is the growth of the sport you get a guy who doesn't watch MMA

1402
01:06:00.42 --> 01:06:06.90
They only watch you know basketball football the traditional sports and they get a glimpse into MMA and they see that all the blood and stuff

1403
01:06:06.90 --> 01:06:10.50
They're like this is a dumb sport. This is not even a sport. This is like this shouldn't be legal

1404
01:06:10.66 --> 01:06:15.22
This is like two human beings and everyone changing me know. Okay, so when the fight stopped that that

1405
01:06:15.30 --> 01:06:19.54
Petus Ferguson fight it stops right they stop it. They get on how they cut to the crowd everyone

1406
01:06:19.54 --> 01:06:20.82
So I'll just see their reaction

1407
01:06:20.82 --> 01:06:26.62
There is like businessmen and their suits drinking their drinks. It's like the epitome of like gladiator old school

1408
01:06:26.62 --> 01:06:33.10
The king with all the grapes and the stuff and high five and stuff right mean while these two guys are like one guy has a broken-hand

1409
01:06:33.10 --> 01:06:37.98
The guy has blood all well. They both have blood all over right so as an outsider looking in you like

1410
01:06:38.54 --> 01:06:45.10
It's reasonable to expect them to be like this is this is dumb. This is not a sport. I'm not a sign on to this at all. Okay

1411
01:06:45.26 --> 01:06:47.82
Then you get these post-fight shenanigans

1412
01:06:47.82 --> 01:06:53.82
Kabib and guys jumping out of the ring into the crowd continuing to fight after he won by the way

1413
01:06:53.82 --> 01:06:58.14
So that and I'm not saying that this is how I'm looking at I'm saying this is how an outsider will see it

1414
01:06:58.14 --> 01:07:00.22
Interesting and then you see you know months ago

1415
01:07:00.22 --> 01:07:03.66
Whatever Connor flying in to New York and busing up the bus

1416
01:07:03.98 --> 01:07:09.42
We could be in in and it's this thing and you know all this stuff guys getting injured from the broken glass all this stuff

1417
01:07:09.42 --> 01:07:12.38
Right it's a it's not cool for an outsider looking

1418
01:07:12.38 --> 01:07:17.18
Yeah, it's like this is not a sport. This is dumb these guys aren't people these aren't civilized people all this stuff

1419
01:07:17.82 --> 01:07:19.58
But from the inside

1420
01:07:19.58 --> 01:07:25.90
Well, man, I'm really looking forward to this fight now after Connor did that then you know then you know things happen

1421
01:07:25.90 --> 01:07:30.94
Conor's talking all this trash. It's like oh Annie's backing it up. Oh my gosh. I want to see this even more now

1422
01:07:31.26 --> 01:07:36.46
If you get and I like fader to her. That's it fade or I like him too. What if everyone was like fader though

1423
01:07:37.26 --> 01:07:41.98
There would be a lot of fights that you just don't care about you be like a all right cool or

1424
01:07:42.70 --> 01:07:45.50
But on the flutters and because I would I would care about all of them

1425
01:07:46.22 --> 01:07:49.18
You would not care about you care about them left last I think well

1426
01:07:49.18 --> 01:07:52.22
You I don't know I don't know what you care about sometimes but

1427
01:07:53.02 --> 01:07:55.66
The people because if the reason fader is fader

1428
01:07:56.38 --> 01:08:00.06
To the extent that fader is fader is because of other people are not like fader

1429
01:08:00.06 --> 01:08:03.98
It's a comparing to everyone else and it's all crazy and he just sits or it looks at him and then knocks him out or

1430
01:08:03.98 --> 01:08:09.82
Jokes him out or remarks because when you think about it isn't that really the martial arts spirit for sure super stoic

1431
01:08:09.82 --> 01:08:16.30
And that's how it has it yeah, yeah, yeah, but now hey martial arts let's face it when you're in the game if you watch it

1432
01:08:16.30 --> 01:08:24.14
MMA special you'll see if you watch this this is it goes like the martial arts spirit of the thing is very small

1433
01:08:24.14 --> 01:08:29.66
Yeah, very small this is a show. Yeah, don't get around this is the show with real punches real kicks blood all that stuff

1434
01:08:29.66 --> 01:08:31.02
And this is all part of the show

1435
01:08:31.02 --> 01:08:38.86
What happened I definitely think of it more as a sport than I do think of it as a display of martial arts for the community

1436
01:08:39.26 --> 01:08:40.78
I'm not thinking about that way anymore

1437
01:08:40.78 --> 01:08:47.10
So sport but I would even go beyond sport. It's a show straight up because if it was just a sport you know what they did for the first time

1438
01:08:47.10 --> 01:08:49.10
I don't know if you notice as you probably did

1439
01:08:49.42 --> 01:08:53.10
They had like fog on the on the octagon

1440
01:08:53.10 --> 01:08:59.18
Yeah, I was like only for kind of the dry ice the fact dry ice effect, right really

1441
01:08:59.58 --> 01:09:05.90
Like you what do you think I give that the negatron yeah, well, there was a while where UFC was trying to lean towards the other direction

1442
01:09:05.90 --> 01:09:09.66
They took away all the show stuff and they made it look like more like a sporty

1443
01:09:09.66 --> 01:09:12.78
Yeah, yeah, and we all kind of go back a little bit

1444
01:09:13.18 --> 01:09:18.78
Yeah, man it's in because they do ownership over whoa, yeah, and you know those obviously like a quote

1445
01:09:18.78 --> 01:09:22.74
I'm called branding play you know we want to kind of go mainstream with the sport edge of it, and you know

1446
01:09:22.74 --> 01:09:27.02
Make it a kind of a whole so here's a thing Brad, it's not a whole something like it's totally there's a difference

1447
01:09:27.02 --> 01:09:33.18
We need scoring a ball in a basket or running across the Inzo or the goal line for touchdown and all this stuff out running guys

1448
01:09:33.18 --> 01:09:41.02
Trying to just basically tuck you to the ground and there's a difference between that being the goal and the goal being to hurt the guy is bad

1449
01:09:41.02 --> 01:09:46.78
Is he? Yeah, or they incapacitate them as bad as you know something I said on when I was on Joe Rogan's podcast

1450
01:09:46.78 --> 01:09:52.10
I was like if you go watch when any of those other sports when they escalate

1451
01:09:52.10 --> 01:09:55.18
They escalate to what you actually want to see which is MMA

1452
01:09:56.54 --> 01:09:59.98
Like what happens when a basketball game gets a little too rough they fight each other

1453
01:09:59.98 --> 01:10:04.26
What happens when hockey gets a little bit today fight each other what happens when football gets a little bit too rough

1454
01:10:04.26 --> 01:10:09.02
They fight even baseball someone someone does something out alive and baseball they fight each other

1455
01:10:09.02 --> 01:10:11.50
Yes, let's just get rid of the ball get rid of the net

1456
01:10:11.74 --> 01:10:16.42
Get rid of the hockey stick and just puts them on the ball get it on yeah, and that yeah

1457
01:10:16.42 --> 01:10:23.54
That's why and that I mean obviously that's a whole whole another thing, but if you and I'm not saying there's necessarily a confusion

1458
01:10:23.54 --> 01:10:30.06
Between it like us the sport and the show and the martial arts and all that but I'm just saying they're there three different elements in

1459
01:10:30.06 --> 01:10:33.54
The sometimes it just gave me a whole like interesting idea

1460
01:10:33.54 --> 01:10:40.48
So sometimes for me I'm so functional like I operate and such a

1461
01:10:40.94 --> 01:10:45.98
Functional mindset that it doesn't even work right it just doesn't work

1462
01:10:46.98 --> 01:10:51.58
It doesn't work with normal people right like I like hey just like no this is just gonna be

1463
01:10:51.58 --> 01:10:57.46
What is gonna be playing if I was if I was in charge of the entire UFC

1464
01:10:57.74 --> 01:11:00.74
What would it look like and it would probably just be?

1465
01:11:01.42 --> 01:11:07.50
So functional it be the extreme that you would that you're saying people would just be like I don't really know if I want to watch this

1466
01:11:07.50 --> 01:11:14.10
And however I would say if you dug deep into the training methodologies and you really understood the people

1467
01:11:14.10 --> 01:11:19.30
Which UFC does a decent job now with what's it called when they're leading up to the fight

1468
01:11:19.30 --> 01:11:26.50
They're the advantage so you go watch the embedded you get to see kind of it's it's not highly edited embedded

1469
01:11:27.22 --> 01:11:30.42
And you get to see what but I would you know for me

1470
01:11:30.42 --> 01:11:34.82
I would make the whole thing would be like functional it would be like oh

1471
01:11:35.02 --> 01:11:39.54
There would be lights that show you everyone. They would be color lights. Why do you need color lights?

1472
01:11:39.54 --> 01:11:42.98
You know what I mean? You get everybody fired. Yeah, no we didn't do that

1473
01:11:42.98 --> 01:11:50.30
You can what I get fired up. You see the guy walking in the gauge. That's about to that's about to fight another human being. Well, it doesn't work that way though

1474
01:11:50.30 --> 01:11:56.18
Yeah, I know like the even if it like again go back to everyone being stoic

1475
01:11:56.18 --> 01:11:58.78
Right, it'd be like it'd be reduced

1476
01:11:58.94 --> 01:12:03.50
It would be less of a show and in fact you might even argue that it's kind of has as

1477
01:12:04.22 --> 01:12:08.42
We've seen that before like in just like other like you ever watch like like a

1478
01:12:08.42 --> 01:12:13.90
Crati tournament or something like that. Yeah, yeah, it's like they don't develop characters or nothing like that

1479
01:12:13.90 --> 01:12:16.54
They're just this is guy. Hey, this guy's good and so like cool

1480
01:12:16.54 --> 01:12:19.34
I want to see what he's good at and then you sort of forget about it

1481
01:12:19.34 --> 01:12:25.54
You don't anticipate that unless you're way way in the game. Yeah, but yeah, my my personal

1482
01:12:27.50 --> 01:12:31.82
Vision doesn't always line up well with like the

1483
01:12:31.82 --> 01:12:38.98
Drama creation that everyone else likes yeah, but that's that's literally life

1484
01:12:38.98 --> 01:12:44.40
That's like why that's why you want to watch it because of the big part of it is because of the job

1485
01:12:44.40 --> 01:12:49.58
Chill son and wise man right said one time once one fight ends

1486
01:12:49.58 --> 01:12:54.82
That's when the promotion for the next fight begins so that you know when he gets on the mic after the fight is done

1487
01:12:54.82 --> 01:13:00.88
He's essentially promoting the next one and but and the thing is it's totally proven like you even like

1488
01:13:00.88 --> 01:13:04.84
Someone saying why do you kid why like people coming to you see why are you supporting Connor?

1489
01:13:04.84 --> 01:13:07.60
He's such a bad rule model all that that's all good stuff like

1490
01:13:07.60 --> 01:13:10.96
Well, if they if they were like oh, who's that guy Connor?

1491
01:13:10.96 --> 01:13:14.16
You support this. Let me look into this guy. That's a failure

1492
01:13:14.16 --> 01:13:20.000
But yeah, to to level him hate them the thing is if I dislike a guy and there's guys that I dislike I understand

1493
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:27.04
I don't dislike them as people I dislike dislike what we call the UFC character. Yeah, you know like the guy that that's on the mic and doing the whatever

1494
01:13:27.04 --> 01:13:31.12
I'm just not a fan action the anti fan. I want him to lose like if he's fighting a guy

1495
01:13:31.12 --> 01:13:34.80
Let's like don't know the other guy. What's interesting? You know I think kind of changed my perspective a little bit

1496
01:13:34.80 --> 01:13:41.86
Is I like Tito Ortiz he had this where he has a horrible his reputation was always like he was a jerk

1497
01:13:41.86 --> 01:13:47.36
And he's a dead guy. Yeah, he was a heal. Yeah, he'll and I I didn't know him well

1498
01:13:47.36 --> 01:13:51.32
But I mean I trained with him some and you know Dean Dean trained with him a lot

1499
01:13:51.32 --> 01:13:57.80
So I kind of knew him by proxy and Tito Ortiz as a dude as like a just a dude outside of that whole world

1500
01:13:57.80 --> 01:14:04.04
Totally cool until a good to go. Yeah, you know totally cool. Hey bisming's the same way like this being kind of a heal

1501
01:14:04.04 --> 01:14:09.68
I've met bisming. I trained with bisming. Bisming's totally good dude. You know changed hard hard work great work ethic

1502
01:14:09.68 --> 01:14:13.64
Good dude. I'm not saying again. I don't want to make it sound like I know these guys

1503
01:14:13.64 --> 01:14:17.56
And I'm all bros with them because I'm not but I've trained with them. I've been on the map with them. You know like I know

1504
01:14:17.56 --> 01:14:24.52
I can understand their character outside of the character that they play on TV and

1505
01:14:25.08 --> 01:14:31.000
The character that they have and maybe that's why for me when I look at Connor and I see all this stuff

1506
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.60
I look at it and I think yeah, you know what behind that

1507
01:14:34.60 --> 01:14:39.64
It's gonna be another guy that's a hard worker that wants to win and take care of his family like

1508
01:14:39.64 --> 01:14:44.36
Okay, and he's got he's doing some stuff and he's talking about red panties and you know

1509
01:14:44.36 --> 01:14:51.08
He just that's what he's doing because then I look at it the same way I see a guy like bisming a guy like T or T's

1510
01:14:51.32 --> 01:14:53.32
Who are behind that

1511
01:14:53.56 --> 01:14:55.56
That front that they put up?

1512
01:14:55.80 --> 01:15:01.96
They're just they're just hardworking guys. I like to fight. Yeah, but I don't see Connor as a bad guy as the heal though

1513
01:15:01.96 --> 01:15:03.56
Connor's a good guy. He's like

1514
01:15:03.88 --> 01:15:11.12
He's anti opponent like heal. He'll really kind of he'll talk bad about his opponent not necessarily bad like

1515
01:15:11.12 --> 01:15:15.76
necessarily bad, but you know he'll talk himself up over his opponent kind of thing

1516
01:15:15.76 --> 01:15:22.48
But he's not like like bisming will actively just like chelsoon and just like a T or T they'll actively play the bad guy

1517
01:15:22.48 --> 01:15:26.000
Just a little bit but to the point where they will be categorized is that oh

1518
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.20
Yeah, people will think about the thing about the stuff that chelsoon and set was saying about Anderson Silva

1519
01:15:31.20 --> 01:15:35.52
Oh, yeah, you just yeah, that was crazy and chelsoons a good example

1520
01:15:36.08 --> 01:15:40.32
Even though chelsoon and you can tell Brad that guys like every time I did stuff with chelsoon

1521
01:15:40.32 --> 01:15:48.40
video watch right and put like full on accommodating like come like overly polite person in ways that he doesn't have to do that

1522
01:15:48.40 --> 01:15:52.64
You don't have to do this polite stuff. So he's an he's one of those guys, but I could tell like okay

1523
01:15:52.80 --> 01:15:55.76
This is the show and I get it and actually I dig it

1524
01:15:56.64 --> 01:15:59.76
Like bisming I was genuinely surprised how nice of it

1525
01:15:59.76 --> 01:16:03.36
I did a video with bisming if you want to look at the very funny video too spy the way

1526
01:16:03.36 --> 01:16:08.000
Which one did you do with bisming? It's not to live around just show I forget what episode but we

1527
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.60
Oh yeah, we did a lot of snatch yeah

1528
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.72
He was he played the main guy

1529
01:16:14.72 --> 01:16:17.12
Yeah, yeah, smash the movie right. What are you?

1530
01:16:17.12 --> 01:16:20.32
You didn't call it snatch what you call it snatchy snatchy

1531
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.40
It's good. He does a really good job. So it's it's Michael his bisming kit Dale

1532
01:16:27.36 --> 01:16:31.80
Is Tommy and then Hennato is let me ask you this for Kenny Florian

1533
01:16:31.84 --> 01:16:34.000
Can you Florian when you did the heat?

1534
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.92
He's he's yeah that he's got some chops

1535
01:16:37.92 --> 01:16:43.52
Very much straight up acting chops. Yes, Kenny Florian shout out. Yes. Yeah straight up acting chops

1536
01:16:43.52 --> 01:16:46.64
So Kenny Florian not to go too deep into that but kids so

1537
01:16:46.64 --> 01:16:52.56
Look on top of that Kenny Florian is super nice too. Yeah, and nice where he got tested with with us with me

1538
01:16:53.36 --> 01:16:56.96
On how nice he could be as far as tolerant so we go up there right

1539
01:16:56.96 --> 01:17:03.60
This one you can't let you the whole thing to remove the whole thing two cameras right we get and so you know one angle at him

1540
01:17:03.60 --> 01:17:05.60
One angle at Hennato

1541
01:17:05.68 --> 01:17:14.96
The angle on him the camera just didn't work something with the SD card or whatever this and we've totally had to like get access to the restaurant after hours and like all this stuff

1542
01:17:16.32 --> 01:17:22.16
Schedule with Kenny not to mention who is like you know this is like after he crossed over into straight-up mainstream

1543
01:17:22.16 --> 01:17:27.68
You can't just get Kenny Florian off of you know he had chosen like he's kind of a high level guy at this time and

1544
01:17:27.68 --> 01:17:34.24
And I get home like we're you know we're adding in and I'm like we got our there's no choice we got to reshoot this thing and then

1545
01:17:34.80 --> 01:17:40.88
Like man and Kenny Florian yeah like whatever he's like cool. Let's go go like reshave. Yeah. Go to you

1546
01:17:41.04 --> 01:17:48.96
We're not Dean and I were doing the trials for ADCC in 2002 for the 2003 ADCC

1547
01:17:49.68 --> 01:17:55.60
Ken flow came out and he was one of the competitors and it's same thing like we didn't really know him that well

1548
01:17:55.60 --> 01:17:58.72
But you know we were all kind of like a back belt. She's not all that stuff

1549
01:17:58.72 --> 01:18:01.92
So actually I wasn't a back belt at that time. I was a brown belt

1550
01:18:02.40 --> 01:18:08.48
But we you know everyone was just like super cool. Yeah, they Dean was a brown belt. What am I talking about? I was a purple belt

1551
01:18:09.12 --> 01:18:11.12
Dang

1552
01:18:11.12 --> 01:18:13.12
all right so

1553
01:18:13.12 --> 01:18:17.20
Where this whole thing goes from and this is interesting that that you brought this up

1554
01:18:17.68 --> 01:18:20.96
This is the another thing I wanted to talk about which is

1555
01:18:20.96 --> 01:18:26.64
This idea of a tattoo detachment which talk about all the time

1556
01:18:28.24 --> 01:18:31.76
And I've seen like another little reveal

1557
01:18:32.48 --> 01:18:37.28
On detachment maybe another angle. Okay, so picture this black belt versus a white belt

1558
01:18:38.40 --> 01:18:40.40
Your training jiu-jitsu

1559
01:18:41.04 --> 01:18:44.40
The white belt is like grabbing your sleeve

1560
01:18:44.40 --> 01:18:49.92
Or grabbing your belt or grabbing like doing something

1561
01:18:50.48 --> 01:18:51.84
Whatever he's doing

1562
01:18:51.84 --> 01:18:56.48
Doesn't matter and it will not affect the outcome at all

1563
01:18:58.88 --> 01:19:05.76
And I see and so what should you do as a black belt as a as a better grapple? What are you gonna do and so when's doing something that doesn't matter

1564
01:19:05.76 --> 01:19:09.60
What do you do you just kind of ignore it? It's like okay, that's not gonna affect the outcome. I'm not gonna worry about it

1565
01:19:09.60 --> 01:19:20.000
As leaders I see people getting caught up all the times in little things that will not affect the outcome unless they let it

1566
01:19:21.36 --> 01:19:23.36
So I see

1567
01:19:23.84 --> 01:19:27.92
Some white belt blow them in the chain of commands going all crazy grabbing their sleeve and this

1568
01:19:28.40 --> 01:19:34.64
Leader on the top like it gets concerned about it and puts time and effort into something that doesn't matter

1569
01:19:34.64 --> 01:19:37.92
Whether it's a little personality rub a little ego uprising

1570
01:19:37.92 --> 01:19:44.56
It's like should we do it this way or should we do it that way doesn't matter that's a little sleeve grab it doesn't matter

1571
01:19:44.96 --> 01:19:55.76
And I see people getting caught up on things that don't matter all the time and what I've realized is it's something that I figured out

1572
01:19:57.28 --> 01:20:02.16
A long time ago. I'm no win, but a long time ago. I figured out you know what that thing doesn't matter

1573
01:20:02.16 --> 01:20:05.84
I'm not gonna worry about it that thing doesn't matter. I'm not gonna worry about it. That thing doesn't matter. That thing doesn't matter

1574
01:20:05.84 --> 01:20:12.16
I'm not gonna worry about it that thing matters. I'm gonna focus on that thing and that makes

1575
01:20:13.92 --> 01:20:20.16
That makes a big a big big big big difference. It's it's leadership capital because if I'm investing my leadership capital

1576
01:20:20.16 --> 01:20:25.36
And you're getting your hand off my sleeve or trying to do it my way instead of your way or trying to keep your ego and check

1577
01:20:25.84 --> 01:20:31.36
If that's what I'm investing my leadership capital is I have nothing left to invest in the thing that's actually matters

1578
01:20:31.36 --> 01:20:36.08
Just like if you're a black belt and someone guys grabbing your sleeve and you focus on pulling that and off your whole time

1579
01:20:36.08 --> 01:20:41.88
You're gonna waste energy and maybe you can give up position because you're cuz you're focused on something that did not

1580
01:20:42.52 --> 01:20:43.52
matter

1581
01:20:43.52 --> 01:20:44.52
so

1582
01:20:44.52 --> 01:20:51.76
It is important to realize and to learn to differentiate between things that don't matter and things that do matter

1583
01:20:53.12 --> 01:20:56.98
And in order to tell the difference between those two things you have to be able to

1584
01:20:57.72 --> 01:20:59.72
detach

1585
01:20:59.72 --> 01:21:01.72
and

1586
01:21:01.72 --> 01:21:06.60
Step back and obviously this is the same thing not just with your jitsu not just with leadership

1587
01:21:06.60 --> 01:21:09.56
Not just with combat because it's the same thing in combat you're gonna have

1588
01:21:09.80 --> 01:21:12.56
Things that don't things are happening on the battlefield that don't matter

1589
01:21:13.16 --> 01:21:17.28
little hey guys moving here instead of there that doesn't matter. Oh this guy's moving there so it doesn't matter

1590
01:21:17.40 --> 01:21:23.76
The enemies doing this okay doesn't matter. Oh wait the enemy did that thing that matters or one of my guys did this thing that matters

1591
01:21:24.60 --> 01:21:28.36
So how do you learn to discriminate between the two?

1592
01:21:28.36 --> 01:21:34.36
If you have to be able to detach from it. That's what you have to do you have to be able to detach and

1593
01:21:35.56 --> 01:21:37.56
If you if you don't

1594
01:21:37.88 --> 01:21:45.60
Learn to detach you're gonna constantly get tripped up on things that don't really matter and I'll tell you the more

1595
01:21:49.36 --> 01:21:52.32
The better you get the less things matter

1596
01:21:53.72 --> 01:21:56.20
The better you get the last things matter

1597
01:21:56.20 --> 01:21:58.20
and

1598
01:21:58.20 --> 01:22:01.88
The better you get the more the more important things matter

1599
01:22:02.44 --> 01:22:06.28
So you end up just wasting no energy on things that don't matter and

1600
01:22:06.92 --> 01:22:11.52
Focusing all your energy on things that actually matter and this is the difference man

1601
01:22:11.76 --> 01:22:15.40
This is how you went into jitsu. This is how you win as a leader. This is how you win in combat

1602
01:22:16.12 --> 01:22:21.000
And this is truly how you win in life think about all the thing you don't what you used to talk about a lot

1603
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.52
You haven't done it in a while you just talk about distractions

1604
01:22:23.52 --> 01:22:31.48
How things can distract you that's totally true. That's what I'm talking about the things that distract you from what actually matters

1605
01:22:32.28 --> 01:22:34.28
so you have to

1606
01:22:34.78 --> 01:22:40.24
You have to figure out how to detach from those things. I was doing some reading as is

1607
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Per norm shows a guy named Keith Douglas

1608
01:22:44.48 --> 01:22:46.48
He was a British soldier World War II

1609
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.56
He's kind of a bad ask he was stuck in a administrative position in October of

1610
01:22:52.56 --> 01:22:55.92
1942 during the second battle of

1611
01:22:56.48 --> 01:22:59.92
L. Alameen and so he's stuck in this administrative position

1612
01:22:59.92 --> 01:23:05.44
So he's when A wall went to the front line enjoying the fight and kind of after it and one of the things that he wrote

1613
01:23:06.32 --> 01:23:12.48
He said to be sentimental or emotional now is dangerous to oneself and to others

1614
01:23:14.24 --> 01:23:15.60
So

1615
01:23:15.60 --> 01:23:17.60
What is he talking about? You can't get emotional

1616
01:23:17.60 --> 01:23:22.24
You can't get sentimental. You can't get caught up in things that don't matter

1617
01:23:23.36 --> 01:23:26.000
After his return from Africa this guy Keith Douglas

1618
01:23:26.56 --> 01:23:30.000
He wrote a book about his experience. Here's a little excerpt. You can kind of

1619
01:23:31.92 --> 01:23:36.56
Think about what this guy has been through that taught him these lessons. Here we go

1620
01:23:38.56 --> 01:23:44.88
As I came up to them I recognized one of them as a Robin the observation officer who's aid

1621
01:23:44.88 --> 01:23:47.36
I had been asking for earlier in the day I

1622
01:23:48.40 --> 01:23:56.24
Recognized his fleece lines fleece lines swayed waste coat and polished brass shoulder titles and then his face

1623
01:23:57.20 --> 01:23:59.20
strained and tired with pain

1624
01:23:59.92 --> 01:24:02.24
His left foot was smashed to a pulp

1625
01:24:03.12 --> 01:24:05.36
Mingled with the remainder of a boot

1626
01:24:07.04 --> 01:24:10.56
But as I spoke to Robin saying have you got a turnic at Robin?

1627
01:24:10.56 --> 01:24:14.56
He answered apologetically. I'm afraid I haven't Keith

1628
01:24:17.12 --> 01:24:19.12
I looked at the second man

1629
01:24:19.76 --> 01:24:23.52
Only his clothes distinguished him as a human being

1630
01:24:25.68 --> 01:24:27.68
His face had gone

1631
01:24:28.72 --> 01:24:32.40
In place of it was a huge yellow vegetable

1632
01:24:34.48 --> 01:24:38.16
The eyes blinked in it without lashes

1633
01:24:38.16 --> 01:24:46.40
Indigrotesc huge mouth dribbled and moaned like a child exhausted with crying

1634
01:24:53.84 --> 01:24:56.08
So there's an example

1635
01:24:57.52 --> 01:24:59.20
of a horrible

1636
01:24:59.20 --> 01:25:06.40
Situation that you have to learn to detach and you have to be able to focus on things that actually matter because

1637
01:25:06.40 --> 01:25:13.28
As Keith Douglas said to be sentimental or emotional now is dangerous to oneself and to others

1638
01:25:15.84 --> 01:25:21.52
Now as I was digging into a little bit of Keith Douglas and I will we'll get to Keith Douglas fully on the podcast

1639
01:25:21.52 --> 01:25:24.16
But he added to that line

1640
01:25:25.60 --> 01:25:27.60
He added another line

1641
01:25:27.60 --> 01:25:34.16
That I want to hit as well to be sentimental or emotional now is dangerous to on self and to others and he continues

1642
01:25:34.16 --> 01:25:41.12
To trust anyone or to admit any hope of a better world. It's criminally foolish

1643
01:25:43.20 --> 01:25:46.72
As foolish as it is to stop working for it

1644
01:25:51.84 --> 01:25:53.84
So

1645
01:25:54.88 --> 01:25:58.56
I you know that's a little tangent that's a tangent but

1646
01:25:58.56 --> 01:26:04.96
It's powerful and like I said we'll get to Keith Douglas's book and

1647
01:26:05.68 --> 01:26:08.48
That book got published after the war

1648
01:26:09.68 --> 01:26:16.64
And unfortunately Keith Douglas never saw that book get published because he was killed by enemy mortar fire on June 9th

1649
01:26:16.64 --> 01:26:18.64
Just a few days

1650
01:26:18.64 --> 01:26:21.68
Into the DDA invasion of Normandy which he took part in

1651
01:26:21.68 --> 01:26:32.24
But again luckily you left us a lesson which is to control your emotions and I think as a

1652
01:26:33.60 --> 01:26:35.84
As a person and it as an individual

1653
01:26:37.12 --> 01:26:43.92
If you can start trying to discriminate between things that matter and things that don't matter

1654
01:26:46.08 --> 01:26:49.36
And the way that you do that is by detaching from everything

1655
01:26:49.36 --> 01:26:51.36
And

1656
01:26:51.36 --> 01:26:58.96
Then you can pay attention and you can assess logically not emotionally what's important and what's not and you focus on the things that matter and you're gonna make your entire life

1657
01:27:01.04 --> 01:27:04.32
A lot easier to great lesson from Keith Douglas and

1658
01:27:07.84 --> 01:27:10.48
I think that's all

1659
01:27:10.48 --> 01:27:13.84
I've got for today. I will say that speaking of lessons

1660
01:27:14.64 --> 01:27:18.000
I've got a little lesson to pass on

1661
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.12
You know book in a forthcoming book

1662
01:27:22.56 --> 01:27:24.56
It's called Mikey in the Dragons

1663
01:27:26.24 --> 01:27:28.24
And

1664
01:27:28.88 --> 01:27:30.40
If you didn't hear about the book yet

1665
01:27:30.40 --> 01:27:34.56
Mikey in the Dragons is about a young kid that's scared of everything and that makes his life

1666
01:27:35.28 --> 01:27:37.28
Pretty hard pretty miserable

1667
01:27:37.52 --> 01:27:41.04
Because he's scared of everything one day he finds a book and

1668
01:27:41.04 --> 01:27:45.04
And I

1669
01:27:45.60 --> 01:27:49.60
He scared everything he finds this book and and there's a book within the book in the story

1670
01:27:50.08 --> 01:27:53.04
And we'll go into the book within the book right here real quick

1671
01:27:54.32 --> 01:27:56.32
And then one day

1672
01:27:56.72 --> 01:27:58.72
Mikey noticed a book

1673
01:27:58.72 --> 01:28:00.72
He opened it up and took a quick look

1674
01:28:00.96 --> 01:28:07.36
He did that pictures of dragons with things like a snake and all kinds of scary things that made Mikey shake

1675
01:28:07.36 --> 01:28:11.28
But in the pictures there was a boy too

1676
01:28:11.92 --> 01:28:14.32
Who didn't look scared but like he knew what to do

1677
01:28:15.12 --> 01:28:20.08
And even though Mikey was scared indeed he decided that he would give the book a read

1678
01:28:21.04 --> 01:28:23.76
He opened the first page which he eagerly read and

1679
01:28:24.64 --> 01:28:26.88
This is what the dragon book said

1680
01:28:28.16 --> 01:28:32.96
There once was a kingdom long ago and far away on the kingdom and suffered a horrible day

1681
01:28:32.96 --> 01:28:39.04
Their protector and leader their king he had died and when they found out the whole village cried

1682
01:28:39.92 --> 01:28:41.92
When the king was alive he was a powerful force

1683
01:28:42.72 --> 01:28:46.48
Now they took the dead king away by carriage and horse

1684
01:28:47.36 --> 01:28:50.000
They knew they would miss him and that made them sad

1685
01:28:50.16 --> 01:28:55.76
But there was something else that made them feel bad the king had always been so strong and brave and

1686
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.48
Protected the kingdom from the dragon cave

1687
01:28:58.48 --> 01:29:04.24
The dragon cave was just over the hill and filled with scary dragons that were ready to kill

1688
01:29:06.88 --> 01:29:08.88
And the story

1689
01:29:08.88 --> 01:29:10.88
Continues from there

1690
01:29:10.88 --> 01:29:15.52
And explains that no one in the village in the kingdom would stand up to the dragons

1691
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.32
Except the young prince who is only seven years old

1692
01:29:19.52 --> 01:29:21.52
And he's nervous and he's scared

1693
01:29:22.24 --> 01:29:24.24
He's no if he can handle it

1694
01:29:24.24 --> 01:29:28.72
But he kind of realizes he's gonna have to step up so he goes to his father's war chest

1695
01:29:31.04 --> 01:29:35.12
I'm so happy that I could put the word war chest in a book yeah and

1696
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.76
He finds the shield and he finds the sword of his dad and they're both super heavy

1697
01:29:44.16 --> 01:29:46.16
But then he also finds a little note

1698
01:29:47.84 --> 01:29:52.72
A little note from his father the king that explains how to overcome the dragons

1699
01:29:52.72 --> 01:29:54.72
So

1700
01:29:54.72 --> 01:29:56.72
Even though the book is aimed at kids

1701
01:29:56.72 --> 01:29:59.92
I think we all know that we all have dragons to fight

1702
01:30:01.36 --> 01:30:09.92
And like I said on the last podcast really wanted to get this book into the hands of kids and really into the hands of everyone

1703
01:30:10.88 --> 01:30:12.88
But again

1704
01:30:12.88 --> 01:30:14.88
My publisher told me

1705
01:30:14.88 --> 01:30:20.72
That there was no scenario where this book gets published by November so what did I do

1706
01:30:20.72 --> 01:30:26.08
I started my own publishing company and the book will be out in November

1707
01:30:27.60 --> 01:30:30.40
So yeah, it's it's actually getting printed at this time and

1708
01:30:31.52 --> 01:30:36.08
In order to pull this off in order to actually know how many books I need to print

1709
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:41.52
I think it already looks like I need to print more books because you all ordered a lot of them already so thank you

1710
01:30:42.80 --> 01:30:45.68
Preorder so that I know what to print

1711
01:30:45.68 --> 01:30:51.60
So I can print enough of the sacred first edition first it

1712
01:30:52.56 --> 01:30:58.56
If you want you and your kids and your family to know how to crush their dragons

1713
01:31:00.96 --> 01:31:02.96
Appreciate it

1714
01:31:03.68 --> 01:31:09.60
Gonna need that that's what's gonna happen. We're gonna go forward together. Slay dragons in this case. Who's the dragon?

1715
01:31:09.60 --> 01:31:17.60
Well, you know big publishing companies sometimes

1716
01:31:17.52 --> 01:31:20.56
Anyways, we all have our dragons to fight and

1717
01:31:24.48 --> 01:31:28.08
When we fight our dragons well, I don't know maybe sometimes we could use some help

1718
01:31:28.64 --> 01:31:31.60
Echo sometimes you only know any way that we could

1719
01:31:32.16 --> 01:31:37.20
Maybe get some help fighting our dragons. Yeah, so the dragons the dragons

1720
01:31:37.20 --> 01:31:47.44
Our dragons sure are dragon. Yeah, so I'll tell you this this what this might help this will help actually if you realize to the full extent

1721
01:31:48.88 --> 01:31:52.08
That capability capability and knowledge

1722
01:31:53.68 --> 01:31:55.68
That well be fight the dragons

1723
01:31:55.68 --> 01:32:00.80
Those two things are imperative in fighting dragons. Yeah, so

1724
01:32:02.24 --> 01:32:06.000
We're staying on the path that's the capability part them actually the path is both

1725
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:13.04
Yeah, the path covers all yeah capability knowledge always trying to improve so every step forward on the path

1726
01:32:13.92 --> 01:32:17.68
Is a step forward in capability knowledge check

1727
01:32:18.64 --> 01:32:20.64
As opposed to the slippery slope

1728
01:32:21.04 --> 01:32:23.04
Which is step backwards

1729
01:32:23.04 --> 01:32:29.28
And capability and knowledge. I be careful on that one. Yes, so what it will capability right this preparation execution results

1730
01:32:30.08 --> 01:32:34.96
Right just made that up right now literally so it could be flawed, but whatever sounds good to me

1731
01:32:34.96 --> 01:32:38.56
So so staying on the path what start with you, too, of course good place

1732
01:32:38.56 --> 01:32:42.64
We start about you. Yeah, good universal kind of overarching yeah

1733
01:32:42.96 --> 01:32:46.32
How many people hit you up a day that just started you jitsu?

1734
01:32:47.12 --> 01:32:50.88
a lot and what I started doing trying to do is

1735
01:32:51.68 --> 01:32:57.36
Everyone that's that's indicating they just started jitsu first day jitsu second day jitsu just got my kid into

1736
01:32:57.36 --> 01:32:59.36
Just I just retweet it

1737
01:32:59.36 --> 01:33:07.04
And be like boom you're you know in the game just letting people know hey game look okay. Yep. Here's another person all different type of scenario

1738
01:33:07.04 --> 01:33:13.52
Toot by the way different types. Here's the huge one here's old 12 years old 29 years old bad back

1739
01:33:14.24 --> 01:33:16.000
You know Kurt elbow

1740
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.40
I'm a surgeon. I'm a firefighter. I'm a police officer. I'm a CEO

1741
01:33:21.04 --> 01:33:24.72
It doesn't matter good job in the game. Yeah, all good and and

1742
01:33:24.72 --> 01:33:32.000
Every once in a while see this. Yes got my kids into jitsu. You know one of my I wish was maybe a little bit more into it, you know

1743
01:33:33.36 --> 01:33:36.48
Like what should I do or so or whatever maybe not even that they just said

1744
01:33:37.12 --> 01:33:39.12
Like you jump in there

1745
01:33:39.12 --> 01:33:42.96
You know, so it's like it's because a lot of times like oh yeah, this is perfect for my kid

1746
01:33:42.96 --> 01:33:48.56
Oh, yeah, or my kid wants to jump in if yeah, if you're if you're taking your kids to jitsu

1747
01:33:49.60 --> 01:33:54.48
And you're not participating we got an issue. Yeah, let's it let's at the very least just consider that

1748
01:33:54.48 --> 01:33:58.64
Just consider it think no, I'm saying you're saying jump in yeah, yeah get it

1749
01:33:59.20 --> 01:34:06.000
So I had a cool guy come into the gym here and was in please officer and he had his kids

1750
01:34:06.64 --> 01:34:10.72
All fired up, you know all the kids are into it. They're so fired up. That's awesome. I was like oh

1751
01:34:10.96 --> 01:34:16.48
You know what cost are you going to these like wow? I can't trip them immediately level seven guilt trip

1752
01:34:16.48 --> 01:34:22.96
I was like bro are you kidding me? Come on get on the mat. So he's in the game now. Yeah, so and and that's not like that

1753
01:34:22.96 --> 01:34:27.84
Rare of a story because and even just how our gym is laid out where you know the kids guys is going on

1754
01:34:27.84 --> 01:34:30.96
Hey, just just look right behind you right now right behind you

1755
01:34:33.12 --> 01:34:37.52
So you can just let let your kids go. I know you don't watch the kids you want to see what up

1756
01:34:37.52 --> 01:34:40.72
You want to see what's going on. Don't worry about that. They're gonna be fat um, you know

1757
01:34:41.52 --> 01:34:45.92
They got it they got it they got it. Yeah, I think it's on lock yeah unlock even good way

1758
01:34:45.92 --> 01:34:49.60
By the way, yeah and just turn around. It's just jumping down right there

1759
01:34:49.60 --> 01:34:54.88
You're gonna have as much fun as your kid by the way. It's not more but plus you're gonna have something in common with your kid

1760
01:34:54.88 --> 01:35:01.76
Oh yeah, and you're and I'll tell you what if you don't your kid's gonna be beating you is this is gonna be beating you up

1761
01:35:03.04 --> 01:35:08.88
That's gonna suck hey the kids grow up my kids 15 my boy is 15

1762
01:35:09.12 --> 01:35:16.80
Yeah, you better watch out. Yeah, and we want I think there's a secret part of us if not overt part of us that wants our

1763
01:35:16.80 --> 01:35:23.60
Kid one day to like question you stand up to you. Maybe come front you about some stuff some questions

1764
01:35:23.60 --> 01:35:27.60
They have about you and your whole thing. Yeah, you know I got to ask that the other day is like no

1765
01:35:27.60 --> 01:35:32.88
Didn't it really make you mad because the story and dichotomy leadership about the patches right the patches

1766
01:35:32.88 --> 01:35:35.52
Yeah patches on oh yeah. I told you guys no patches and

1767
01:35:36.08 --> 01:35:38.88
Late and Seth made patches anyways and

1768
01:35:38.88 --> 01:35:43.84
Brought him in this guy's like what did it want you like offended and want you mad and I was like no

1769
01:35:43.84 --> 01:35:50.32
Actually, I was kind of thinking of myself well cool these guys have that little rebellious streak that they need as leaders to tell the man

1770
01:35:50.64 --> 01:35:54.96
You know to stick to the man. Yeah, that's fine with me at it. Yeah, yeah

1771
01:35:55.52 --> 01:35:58.40
It wasn't offensive they weren't doing something that's gonna get someone hurt or killed

1772
01:35:58.72 --> 01:36:04.16
They were they were just being little rebels. Yeah, just fine. So do I want to see that with my kids?

1773
01:36:04.16 --> 01:36:06.16
Yes, I want to see a little bit

1774
01:36:06.16 --> 01:36:08.16
Sometimes I need to keep that in food

1775
01:36:08.16 --> 01:36:14.000
Yeah, big time so if you're not doing you do you just and your kids are

1776
01:36:14.48 --> 01:36:19.60
So she fits a boy well, no girl boy whatever yeah that the probability of them standing up to you

1777
01:36:19.60 --> 01:36:24.000
Maybe a little early than you expected is very high that's what I think that's my hypothesis

1778
01:36:24.56 --> 01:36:26.56
That's a good thing not a bad thing

1779
01:36:26.56 --> 01:36:30.000
Yeah, it will be a bad thing if you can't do anything about it because you know

1780
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.64
Pretend it kids get good

1781
01:36:32.64 --> 01:36:38.16
Yeah, yeah, it's funny because you get these kids right who really get into it

1782
01:36:38.16 --> 01:36:40.56
Then they grow up into a dot so the belt system is kind of

1783
01:36:41.12 --> 01:36:46.88
It's like it's like planting a seed before the the plant goes above ground is a lot that goes on underground

1784
01:36:46.88 --> 01:36:50.40
Right, so some you know some plants you know the bamboo the anyway there's a

1785
01:36:51.04 --> 01:36:53.04
What he called is?

1786
01:36:53.04 --> 01:36:56.40
I don't know either way there's an old school story about the bamboo

1787
01:36:56.64 --> 01:37:00.16
It takes like a bunch of years when you plant it

1788
01:37:00.16 --> 01:37:05.36
But once it breaks ground it takes it shoots up super fast right that's how kids are with Gitu

1789
01:37:05.36 --> 01:37:11.60
So you put them in a map of just you but that's an old common story they say that's a metaphor anyway

1790
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.96
So you put the kid in Gitu they really like it and kids they get the belts though

1791
01:37:16.96 --> 01:37:19.84
What are their belts white and then you have these intermediary white

1792
01:37:19.84 --> 01:37:26.28
Right, yellow the main ones are yellow white yellow orange green gray is become a main one now to gray

1793
01:37:26.28 --> 01:37:34.04
Become legit okay, so you get up to green belt that's essentially the purple slash brown belt of kids the green belt

1794
01:37:34.20 --> 01:37:38.44
Interesting and then you can't get a blue belt until 60 traditionally traditionally tradition

1795
01:37:38.44 --> 01:37:42.68
So once you reach blue belt you're essentially a black belt for your body

1796
01:37:42.92 --> 01:37:48.12
That's it your body is like it right in the puberty or whatever here's the thing with nothing

1797
01:37:48.12 --> 01:37:52.12
I don't completely agree with you. Okay, so yeah, I dig it. I hear what you're saying

1798
01:37:52.12 --> 01:37:59.32
But to your point usually 10 years to become a black belt around if you're training hard and all that

1799
01:38:00.44 --> 01:38:04.60
And what you're saying is a kid could start at five and now 16 gets his blue belt

1800
01:38:04.60 --> 01:38:09.72
He's been training for 11 years so to your point his skill level could be very very high

1801
01:38:09.72 --> 01:38:11.92
Yeah, so that's a yeah, you're right and me

1802
01:38:11.92 --> 01:38:17.12
I got into the story so I said black belt maybe your response will either way when he hits blue belt

1803
01:38:17.12 --> 01:38:20.24
That's not a normal. I don't know. Oh, no that is a kick ass

1804
01:38:20.24 --> 01:38:24.40
Blue belt to kill us so he's gonna go oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah my first time fighting his blue belt

1805
01:38:24.40 --> 01:38:29.000
I'm 17 years old and he's beating everyone super easy to by the way and these are adults

1806
01:38:29.24 --> 01:38:33.32
25 to six years old and he's just beating them so he gets his purple belt right right away

1807
01:38:33.32 --> 01:38:37.36
Unless he's in one of these situations where they actually make you be blue belt for two years

1808
01:38:37.36 --> 01:38:41.72
You know sometimes there's that like I think I'd be JJ F does that sometimes competing was anyway

1809
01:38:42.36 --> 01:38:47.16
Anyway, anyway when they when they reach ground meaning adult hood when they reach above ground like the bamboo

1810
01:38:47.16 --> 01:38:49.52
They just shoot because all their fundamentals are like

1811
01:38:49.52 --> 01:38:53.14
Diled like so they have they've developed like a whole

1812
01:38:53.84 --> 01:38:55.84
proprioception yeah and

1813
01:38:56.68 --> 01:39:03.06
Body understanding and it's proprioception not just of their own body, but if they're opponents body as well like they know where

1814
01:39:03.06 --> 01:39:06.56
You're their opponents gonna be yeah, which is legit

1815
01:39:07.68 --> 01:39:09.92
Yeah, so be on the path of jiu-jitsu

1816
01:39:09.92 --> 01:39:15.52
Did you get the overall concept that we're getting that yeah, and yes very jiu-jitsu heavy I think today

1817
01:39:15.52 --> 01:39:20.16
But you know I haven't really been training that much oh either way oh yeah

1818
01:39:20.16 --> 01:39:22.64
Jumping the path you're gonna need a geek an arascart

1819
01:39:22.96 --> 01:39:30.46
Trump people ask where do we start what do I go what do we go to get a geek on like origin main dot com boom

1820
01:39:30.46 --> 01:39:34.90
Gizo plenty pick with it whichever one is right for you. They are all made in America by the way

1821
01:39:35.82 --> 01:39:41.44
Which you know it seems like common knowledge about let's say this is your first introduction to origin main dot

1822
01:39:41.44 --> 01:39:43.44
Boom now you know

1823
01:39:43.44 --> 01:39:47.80
Get a geek get a rash guard jump on the path you just to just jump in yeah

1824
01:39:48.30 --> 01:39:53.84
Usually the first class is freed by the way most places. Yeah, and a lot of people ask

1825
01:39:53.84 --> 01:39:58.88
Hey, I need advice going to my first class just go keep an open mind have fun relax

1826
01:39:59.20 --> 01:40:03.08
Yeah, do all those things yeah a big one is like

1827
01:40:04.68 --> 01:40:09.62
Keep your ears like open, you know, don't don't be that guy like you always say this word don't be the guy

1828
01:40:09.62 --> 01:40:15.000
Be like what if I just do this you know kind of they like what it does more if you just go in to solicitor

1829
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.46
Just listen and I'm hard to annoy I think that might be starting to annoy me a little bit

1830
01:40:20.46 --> 01:40:23.94
When people when I'm talking to a big group of people that have never done to you

1831
01:40:23.94 --> 01:40:26.34
It's before and someone throws out the like

1832
01:40:26.90 --> 01:40:28.98
Why what if you know what if they just grab your arm right here?

1833
01:40:28.98 --> 01:40:34.10
It's like well there's 14 other moves that you can do from that which I didn't get to because I'm trying to teach you this fundamental thing over here

1834
01:40:34.10 --> 01:40:36.10
That you don't understand because you're an idiot

1835
01:40:36.10 --> 01:40:43.70
And so yeah, and that's yeah, I would say that just keep that in mind. That's the advice if you know

1836
01:40:43.70 --> 01:40:49.14
Yeah, what's the good to keep your ears open keep I don't want to discourage people from asking questions

1837
01:40:49.86 --> 01:40:57.66
But let's just let's just think about how we ask the questions right don't ask it as a challenge to the

1838
01:40:58.38 --> 01:41:03.94
Canon of just you knowledge which is the way some people ask it all you have to do is this like no

1839
01:41:03.94 --> 01:41:07.98
Actually if you say like hey sometimes he's doing this and I don't know what to do yet

1840
01:41:07.98 --> 01:41:13.22
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you and I won't be annoyed at all if you tell me if you say it to me like you just

1841
01:41:13.70 --> 01:41:15.78
Uncovered the secret key of jitzu

1842
01:41:15.78 --> 01:41:21.06
I'm gonna be slightly annoyed you won't know it, but I'll just be like oh, yeah, well here you go

1843
01:41:21.06 --> 01:41:27.30
Here's what you do. Yeah, so actually you mentioned that key to defeating jitzu you mentioned it

1844
01:41:27.30 --> 01:41:35.58
What do you times run away oh yeah, that's it 100% nobody can submit me if I'm running unless it passes in me true running is a good self defense

1845
01:41:35.58 --> 01:41:42.44
Hey, also at origin. We got we got some supplements at origin and we got joint warfare

1846
01:41:44.02 --> 01:41:50.16
Which will help you train every day we got?

1847
01:41:50.16 --> 01:41:56.60
Criloil which will also help you train every day and those kind of compliment each other

1848
01:41:57.12 --> 01:42:01.48
They yeah, very much they very much to compliment what I didn't the whole mental

1849
01:42:02.28 --> 01:42:04.28
Like curcumin

1850
01:42:05.28 --> 01:42:06.72
And

1851
01:42:06.72 --> 01:42:10.92
Criloil this big like massage for your brain and getting everything so anyways

1852
01:42:10.92 --> 01:42:17.36
So try those those we get great feedback on those all the time also got the discipline which is for

1853
01:42:17.80 --> 01:42:19.80
pre-mission

1854
01:42:19.80 --> 01:42:26.28
Nutrition when you need to do something both cognitive and physical we got your back on this one

1855
01:42:28.32 --> 01:42:34.16
Three scoops. We've determined is kind of the limit in my opinion. Yeah, I think it's kind of limit

1856
01:42:34.16 --> 01:42:38.76
Currently out there. Have you ever taken like the old school pre-work out?

1857
01:42:38.76 --> 01:42:44.88
Yes before jitzu oh no no, I'll take this stuff before jitzu. I've done that before and it's horrible

1858
01:42:44.88 --> 01:42:50.76
It's like the wrong wrong move. I think if you because your your hards beating your all amp up

1859
01:42:50.76 --> 01:42:53.36
It's just not good. You can't think straight. You know

1860
01:42:54.08 --> 01:42:59.72
Discipline is not like that at all three scoops. We'll get you right in the zone where you want to be and

1861
01:43:00.56 --> 01:43:04.08
But I think I haven't tried four scoops because I just think it would be crazy

1862
01:43:04.60 --> 01:43:06.96
But I think four scoops would start to lean towards

1863
01:43:07.52 --> 01:43:13.92
Too much yeah, and that that's the case with most things right where it's like oh, yeah

1864
01:43:13.92 --> 01:43:17.80
Two scoops is better than one and it's true three scoops even better than two dang that's true

1865
01:43:17.80 --> 01:43:22.58
Two scoops and then that's kind of it. Yeah, you can do that. It's mostly that caught me. Yeah, find the balance

1866
01:43:25.08 --> 01:43:27.24
Mook we got mook

1867
01:43:27.68 --> 01:43:29.68
Mook is

1868
01:43:29.68 --> 01:43:30.88
Mook

1869
01:43:30.88 --> 01:43:35.88
Protein mook mook has protein in it. We have multiple flavors now

1870
01:43:36.48 --> 01:43:40.68
We have mint chocolate. We have peanut butter chocolate. We have vanilla gorilla. We have the darkness

1871
01:43:40.68 --> 01:43:47.04
Just straight chocolate which is surprising and good by the way. Why is that surprise are you surprised still right now?

1872
01:43:47.04 --> 01:43:50.20
Well, yeah, I am not surprised at all in your mouth. Well, put it this way

1873
01:43:50.20 --> 01:43:53.88
I'm not surprised in the capability that it took to make it taste good

1874
01:43:53.88 --> 01:43:57.68
I'm not saying that that was the hardest one to make it took us a long time

1875
01:43:57.68 --> 01:44:00.48
We went through iteration it so so if it's surprised you I guess I take that back

1876
01:44:00.48 --> 01:44:07.84
Yeah, it is surprising how good it is because it's good. Yeah, it's really good because it's like easy when you think about it

1877
01:44:07.84 --> 01:44:12.28
You're like okay chocolate mint. Mm-hmm. Okay good. I mean as far as making that taste good

1878
01:44:12.28 --> 01:44:16.48
I'm not gonna be that impressed because come on. It's mint chocolate. It's facing it's good

1879
01:44:16.80 --> 01:44:22.80
Mint or chocolate peanut butter same deal. Yeah, in fact. Isn't it weird though as as good as those flavors are

1880
01:44:22.80 --> 01:44:27.80
How come it's so how come it's been until now that someone gonna actually make them taste the way they're supposed to taste

1881
01:44:27.80 --> 01:44:31.84
I should be more impressed than you are. Yeah, you know now that you break it down like that sure

1882
01:44:31.84 --> 01:44:36.64
I think you're actually right. I didn't think of that. I just considered sheer ass. Oh, obviously

1883
01:44:36.64 --> 01:44:39.96
It's put peanut butter in anything in my opinion, Brad. It's gonna make it taste good

1884
01:44:40.16 --> 01:44:46.36
But if you're gonna try to hit me with the straight chocolate on something with protein that's good for you

1885
01:44:46.36 --> 01:44:49.80
That low sugar. I'm like yeah, okay. I'll give it a chance

1886
01:44:49.80 --> 01:44:51.80
I'll give it a one the gram

1887
01:44:51.80 --> 01:44:58.96
Yeah, I was we went out. I wanted to eat with my fam sure tell you and

1888
01:45:00.08 --> 01:45:02.08
We were talking about we were just talking about food

1889
01:45:02.08 --> 01:45:07.90
And my daughter was like well, somehow she's like you you just eat like one meal and then you just have like nuts and

1890
01:45:07.90 --> 01:45:09.90
Molk

1891
01:45:09.90 --> 01:45:13.84
Because because I do I eat nuts. I get the big giant

1892
01:45:15.16 --> 01:45:17.16
One of the called cans of

1893
01:45:17.16 --> 01:45:24.22
Next no, I make some of the container and I have some yeah contain taking container. Yeah, and I have just have like handful nuts

1894
01:45:24.78 --> 01:45:30.98
I'll put some of them in a bowl and then I'm just doing that and moke and that's when you can't use the peanut buttermilk in my opinion

1895
01:45:30.98 --> 01:45:39.74
Too much not to much nuts. You know get it. I don't agree but hey, I dig it man. Oh, you don't agree that you can do too much peanut butter

1896
01:45:40.14 --> 01:45:42.14
No, so yeah, that hey

1897
01:45:42.14 --> 01:45:46.10
You know I've that one of those you know those huge things of peanut butter the biggest one

1898
01:45:46.10 --> 01:45:48.82
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's from the big box store

1899
01:45:49.82 --> 01:45:51.82
Get a stock file

1900
01:45:52.22 --> 01:45:57.96
Yeah, moke is good protein on the one not tell you what now we just came out with

1901
01:45:57.96 --> 01:46:01.24
Warrior kid moke and

1902
01:46:01.88 --> 01:46:05.52
Did the right thing and and truly this is

1903
01:46:06.24 --> 01:46:15.56
Awesome and I'll tell you why it's awesome because kids need good food kids need healthy food and they're not gonna

1904
01:46:16.12 --> 01:46:19.12
Eat healthy food if it tastes like junk and

1905
01:46:19.92 --> 01:46:24.70
So we made warrior kid moke there's a little less protein in it. There's only a little less only 11 grams

1906
01:46:24.70 --> 01:46:28.18
There's 11 grams of protein sure for for the kids

1907
01:46:28.78 --> 01:46:35.62
There's probiotics there's vitamins. There's one gram of sugar, which is not even sugar

1908
01:46:36.18 --> 01:46:39.66
It's something else whatever is one gram of sugar in there and

1909
01:46:41.98 --> 01:46:46.90
It tastes awesome strawberry and chocolate the chocolate's delicious

1910
01:46:47.54 --> 01:46:50.02
The strawberry is kind of next level

1911
01:46:50.02 --> 01:47:00.78
The strawberry is so good it tastes like someone took the ultra high-end ice cream and made you a milkshake with it strawberry style

1912
01:47:00.78 --> 01:47:05.14
That's what it tastes like your kids are gonna love it and you're gonna love it. That's the problem

1913
01:47:05.14 --> 01:47:12.22
I mean the problem is it's not a problem the reality is I've had strawberry moke warrior kid strawberry moke like for dessert

1914
01:47:12.22 --> 01:47:16.46
Three meals in a row right now the last three meals. I had strawberry moke every time

1915
01:47:16.82 --> 01:47:18.82
Why is that taste good?

1916
01:47:18.82 --> 01:47:25.42
It's good. It's awesome for you. This is a revolution. I'm not gonna throw this out there like just throw this right there

1917
01:47:25.62 --> 01:47:33.88
There's a revolutionary thing, but can you imagine I think this is the first product in the history of the world that I can personally think of you

1918
01:47:33.88 --> 01:47:38.36
Tell me if you can think of something else. Okay. This is the first product that I can think of in the world

1919
01:47:38.78 --> 01:47:43.76
That the kids are gonna want to have it as much as the parents are gonna want them to have it

1920
01:47:43.76 --> 01:47:46.56
I don't know any other thing like that

1921
01:47:46.56 --> 01:47:53.40
Yeah, what other thing is like that the kids want to have it as bad as the parents because like the kids want ice cream

1922
01:47:53.40 --> 01:47:58.92
They want it bad the kids the parents don't want to grab it. Yeah, right the parents want the kids to have

1923
01:47:59.88 --> 01:48:07.70
The vitamin pill the kids don't want to have it. This is a universal want yeah, it's delicious

1924
01:48:09.26 --> 01:48:15.88
And it's awesome for the kids. So I'm super stoked because it's cool when kids want to be on the warrior kid path

1925
01:48:15.88 --> 01:48:19.48
But they don't have good food easily accessible

1926
01:48:19.64 --> 01:48:23.80
This is gonna replace all the little chocolatey sugary drinks that

1927
01:48:24.28 --> 01:48:29.72
Parents have been forced to feed their young children and poison them no more those days are over

1928
01:48:30.68 --> 01:48:32.68
So get on the maltrain

1929
01:48:32.68 --> 01:48:38.36
I get your warrior kids on the maltrain as well. Yeah, the that strawberry one is funny because I don't

1930
01:48:38.76 --> 01:48:44.24
When I go to wherever to get a milkshake. I don't get this strawberry no no no neither would I but

1931
01:48:44.24 --> 01:48:49.12
I'm mixed up the string you know like got some everyone's excited this been some hype

1932
01:48:50.96 --> 01:48:54.96
And you know so I'm like all right, we'll see what up meet my son whatever

1933
01:48:55.16 --> 01:48:59.80
He's too by the way. Oh, so yeah, I mix it up whatever and you know, I taste it

1934
01:48:59.80 --> 01:49:02.44
I think you know something will bring you right back

1935
01:49:02.44 --> 01:49:04.64
Oh, you're a kid this strawberry whatever

1936
01:49:05.36 --> 01:49:08.80
Good brother. I think that's the last time I really got into a strawberry something

1937
01:49:08.80 --> 01:49:14.04
Yeah, like a little strawberry right back then right back and then there's the ready-made strawberry milk

1938
01:49:14.04 --> 01:49:18.12
That used to get when you were a kid and let's face it that that with that is a whole

1939
01:49:18.76 --> 01:49:21.24
Memory section in your brain that will remember that

1940
01:49:21.24 --> 01:49:24.14
It's looking for sometimes you go into a settle 11 you see one of those you're like

1941
01:49:25.44 --> 01:49:30.48
And now that I am straight up milk same the strawberry milk right there

1942
01:49:30.48 --> 01:49:34.32
Yeah, the same thing it's it's it's probably tastes better because it's got a little bit

1943
01:49:34.32 --> 01:49:38.48
It's a little bit thicker. You know, it's got a little bit more a bit milkshake. Yeah

1944
01:49:38.48 --> 01:49:45.20
We're gonna have to come up with strawberry a mocha adult to with a little bit more protein just for GP because it's good

1945
01:49:45.20 --> 01:49:49.56
But in the meantime get that warrior kid strawberry bring you right and the warrior kid chocolate's good too

1946
01:49:49.76 --> 01:49:53.68
It's awesome. Well, I prefer the chocolate. I'm just saying the strawberry

1947
01:49:53.68 --> 01:50:01.40
Prochristing it was good. I like it obviously my son my son drank most of it, but you know, he's too. He's too. Yes, sir

1948
01:50:01.40 --> 01:50:04.80
How's this? What's his bicep workouts looking like right solid?

1949

Pumgranate chai. Yeah, you say pomegranate chai. I don't know whatever tea that you're into because we're because that was the first one

2036
01:57:17.16 --> 01:57:23.16
You made this weird kind of easing into the podcast starting which wasn't really what I had in mind

2037
01:57:23.16 --> 01:57:25.72
Yeah, you know I had more mind like hey, okay

01:57:25.72 --> 01:57:29.80
We press record we start right more if you had a you know cruising over here

2039
01:57:29.80 --> 01:57:36.32
It was kind of yeah, well the podcast has begun now, but as a result a different mindset as a result

2040
01:57:36.32 --> 01:57:43.04
There's that added layer for the people that did listen to that first few seconds of that first first episode

2041
01:57:43.04 --> 01:57:48.04
You say pomegranate chai. You say no pomegranate white tea. Yeah

2042
01:57:48.68 --> 01:57:54.44
And then look at your flucke tune down you won look at you now. Yeah, meet your own pomegranate white

2043
01:57:54.44 --> 01:58:00.76
He took people with us me all the time what kind of tea and I wouldn't really be able to tell him because I try would try different ones

2044
01:58:00.76 --> 01:58:03.44
No one was perfect. So I just wanted to make the perfect one

2045
01:58:03.44 --> 01:58:07.04
Mean your own but yeah, that's how you do you go we have it on our website

You're on Amazon Prime David then you got that also on Amazon and everywhere you can buy books

2049
01:58:22.20 --> 01:58:30.28
We got some we got some books. I got way the warrior kid and Mark's mission those are part of a series and those will

2050
01:58:30.28 --> 01:58:42.28
Those are a good books for your children as a parent. They want how many I don't know how many people have told me this these books have made parenting easier for them

2051
01:58:42.56 --> 01:58:46.16
Because now they just look at their kids say I would you think this is a one of warrior kid would do

2052
01:58:46.72 --> 01:58:49.52
You think a warrior kid would eat that donut right now?

2053
01:58:49.52 --> 01:58:54.18
I don't think so you think that warrior kid would leave with it would would leave their room all dirty

2054
01:58:54.18 --> 01:58:59.78
I don't think so the kids I can oh no way I got parents to say their kids say don't know warrior kid won't do that

2055
01:59:00.50 --> 01:59:04.98
Like when they read warrior kid their voice goes from like hey dad. What do you think we're gonna do to like hey dad?

2056
01:59:06.18 --> 01:59:10.46
I don't think we should do that sounds like weakness to me. Yeah case in point today

2057
01:59:10.98 --> 01:59:16.74
So my daughter. She's sensitive. I wouldn't say things get a lot of things skin sensitive whatever

2058
01:59:16.74 --> 01:59:21.42
So like so if you say something mean to her as like a if another kid says something mean that's something there

2059
01:59:21.42 --> 01:59:24.42
You know super nice to everybody so a

2060
01:59:25.30 --> 01:59:33.42
kid called her a liar who but apparently that's this kid's thing. He just calls people liar like I got a good reaction out of it some point

2061
01:59:33.82 --> 01:59:39.26
Some you know you got a reaction at some point. Yeah, at some point somebody acted all crazies like oh, okay

2062
01:59:39.26 --> 01:59:42.86
Now I know how to make people really now. I know how to get a reaction. Yeah, so

2063
01:59:43.38 --> 01:59:49.40
She doesn't like that you know because she lying was kind of the thing my dad always kind of we would get spanking for lying

2064
01:59:49.40 --> 01:59:52.88
Yeah, that's pretty much it that's a big violation of all things so

2065
01:59:53.40 --> 02:00:01.94
You know, so as a result not to say I spank her for lying. I'm not saying that but she doesn't like the whole lying thing or she gets a cute

2066
02:00:01.94 --> 02:00:04.76
You know how I would like she'll do something. I'll be like hey, did you brush your T she'll be like it?

2067
02:00:04.76 --> 02:00:06.92
I don't be like and then you go smell that breath

2068
02:00:06.92 --> 02:00:10.24
It should be like oh my god she'll get devastated if I think she's lying

2069
02:00:10.24 --> 02:00:13.84
I was like she's gonna check it for a toothbrushes wet or dry

2070
02:00:14.84 --> 02:00:18.000
See I get that go deep. I just you want lied to me. We're going to the ball

2071
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:24.08
But see what you did though, but see what you do though like if I go and investigate that indicates to her

2072
02:00:24.08 --> 02:00:28.36
She's like lack of trust. Yeah, like you think I'm lying and she gets really sad so anyway

2073
02:00:28.36 --> 02:00:31.28
What I'm saying is she sensitive to that kind of stuff? I think I'm manipulating you

2074
02:00:31.84 --> 02:00:36.64
That's a very possible too, but it seems to be where if they're good. Yeah, I've got to watch him

2075
02:00:37.20 --> 02:00:42.24
Yes, you do anyway, so at school she was like hey, that's the boy he called he calls me liar and

2076
02:00:42.24 --> 02:00:48.56
Another day he called her a liar every day like that's his name like your liar every day. Oh, so

2077
02:00:49.28 --> 02:00:52.60
One of my things I'd go to deep into and I tell her hey you're a nice person

2078
02:00:52.60 --> 02:00:54.80
So you'd be nice to people whether they're mean to you or not

2079
02:00:54.80 --> 02:00:58.24
So you're just a nice person you don't like become a mean person because they'd be mean

2080
02:00:58.24 --> 02:01:00.48
She goes well, I really don't like to be called a liar

2081
02:01:00.48 --> 02:01:04.88
I was like would you rather be called a liar or plate face and then she started laughing

2082
02:01:05.52 --> 02:01:10.44
Because she remembers that's how he gets over it. He laughs at himself because of self-plate face

2083
02:01:10.44 --> 02:01:14.48
You know Nathan he's over there. He's all kind of laughing confused. I call it that's funny

2084
02:01:14.48 --> 02:01:16.48
And they laugh about it and they slowly become friends

2085
02:01:17.32 --> 02:01:22.76
So she was like boom away last time that that was today. And I'm not even joking. That was a good one. I dropped it off. Awesome

2086
02:01:23.28 --> 02:01:26.20
So that's way of working kid and marks mission

2087
02:01:26.68 --> 02:01:28.68
We also got this funny goes freedom field manual

2088
02:01:29.56 --> 02:01:34.56
This is the book that what's great about this one people tell me I read two pages every day

2089
02:01:34.56 --> 02:01:38.80
I read three pages every day. I wake up in the morning and read one page

2090
02:01:38.80 --> 02:01:43.36
Get yourself on the path get your mind right as my boy Matthews to say

2091
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.52
Up in your sanity he hit me up on Twitter by the way. I'm gonna track him down and

2092
02:01:50.20 --> 02:01:57.76
So that's this one goes freedom field manual Christmas time good gift for someone you want to put someone on the path cool

2093
02:01:58.24 --> 02:02:04.22
Get him that book. Don't even say anything. Don't even don't even introduce it just give him that book

2094
02:02:04.22 --> 02:02:10.42
I just let it let it ride because when you open it up you're gonna open it you have to open it up because it looks
