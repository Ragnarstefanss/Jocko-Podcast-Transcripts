[00:00:00] This is Jocopodcast number 199 with echo Charles and me, Jocob Willing. Good evening, I go good evening.
[00:00:11] I have not been on this earth long, but I've been through more than most wood in the lifetime.
[00:00:20] I served six years in the United States Marine Corps as a helicopter door gunner and airframes mechanic.
[00:00:26] On my last deployment to Afghanistan, I was involved in a helicopter crash.
[00:00:35] June 23, 2012 was the defining moment in my life.
[00:00:43] I suffered a traumatic brain injury, severe facial trauma,
[00:00:48] a left leg above the knee, amputation, damaged my cervical spine, and damaged my upper arms.
[00:01:01] I remember screaming with tears rolling down my face when they said they were taking my leg above the knee.
[00:01:08] I thought it was all over. That all of my dreams returned in the nightmares.
[00:01:21] I have it on repeat in my head, a scream encompassing terror, pain, and fear of what my life might become.
[00:01:40] Those are the words and thoughts of a wounded warrior, a Marine Corps sergeant, a third generation
[00:01:58] Marine, whose mother and father were both Marines. In this case, this particular
[00:02:08] Marine was able to take that fear, that fear of a new life of a different life,
[00:02:15] of what life might become with those devastating injuries suffered, and turn that new life into one of
[00:02:27] overcoming struggle, a life of facing new challenges and a life of leading the way
[00:02:35] and showing the path for anyone that faces challenges and struggles in any walk of life.
[00:02:49] As this Marine proves, you are never out of the fight, and it is an honor to have this Marine
[00:02:55] with us on the podcast tonight. I'm a Marine by the name of Kirstie, Anis Kirstie. Welcome to the podcast.
[00:03:06] Thank you, you're having me. I dug a little deep on your blogs and Facebook to assemble some
[00:03:14] things, because I like to read what people write, because I think that's the best pathway to figure
[00:03:19] out what they're thinking at that time. You got some pretty incredible statements on there.
[00:03:26] I was able to go through them and assemble them. Let's start off talking about where you came from,
[00:03:35] because I think that's always a good place to start. One thing that you're writing,
[00:03:39] I found this, which I thought was just, I just had to bring this up.
[00:03:45] I'm that guy, somebody is going to go through all your social media stuff.
[00:03:49] That's me. So here we go. This is what you said about your childhood. I was a jerk as a child.
[00:03:54] My mom and dad would just love to tell you stories about me dismantling my window alarm
[00:03:59] to sneak out, disconnecting phone lines, so my principal wouldn't call home, or maybe even bringing
[00:04:04] stink bombs into school. So there's, we're getting an indication, kind of a view into what you were
[00:04:09] like as a kid. Where was it? Where did all this take place? Oh, man. Also, with both my parents
[00:04:15] being in the Marine Corps, we bounced all over the place. But after my mom and my dad got out,
[00:04:19] we went back to the Panhandle of Florida. I spent most of my middle school and high school years there,
[00:04:26] and I was just an absolute terrorist. I mean, I gave my parents a run for their money.
[00:04:31] I mean, I look back now and I actually feel really, really bad about it. I'm terrified of kids
[00:04:36] of my own because I know payback is going to be a pitch. But yeah, I mean, I was just always
[00:04:41] way too smart for my own good. My school was a joke. Athletics were never really hard. I didn't,
[00:04:46] it wasn't challenged. So yeah, I was just always up to, to know good. Nothing like malicious.
[00:04:52] But yeah, how is a little misgivier? The most malicious thing was stink bombs in school.
[00:04:57] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. We don't know what the statute of limitations is, so we're not going to go
[00:05:02] there. Yes. Exactly. What, um, you mentioned athletics a little bit, what sports did you play?
[00:05:08] So growing up, I did a bunch of team sports. I mean, everything from softball to volleyball
[00:05:12] and everything in between, actually like a lot of the individual extreme sports that I'm doing now,
[00:05:17] never even did a music hit. Everything was obviously very southern and team-related.
[00:05:23] So were you good at, were you good athlete? I liked the thing, so. Yeah. I mean, but again,
[00:05:29] I never really was challenged. It was just, I was okay with, you know, being good, but not really
[00:05:33] having to try that hard at it. So. And that was your high school career. I mean, you played sports.
[00:05:38] At what point did you go from the, the stink unit bomber into saying you're going to join the
[00:05:46] Marine Corps? Yeah. Well, so I actually was doing with my high school curriculum at the time I was 15.
[00:05:51] So I started doing college classes at the time, Pensacola Junior College. And yeah, I got my
[00:05:57] two degree and again, were you just hyper motivated to get done with high school or? Yeah. And just bored.
[00:06:04] I was really bored and I mean, I'm sure you're familiar with Pensacola. There's, like,
[00:06:07] especially the surrounding towns. There's just not a lot there. So, yeah, just wanted to be done with it
[00:06:12] and get the heck out and never look back. And then you enlisted, how old were you when you enlisted?
[00:06:18] 17. Did your parents had to sign the paperwork? How did your parents
[00:06:23] two Marines feel about you going in the Marine Corps? So my mom was like, good,
[00:06:28] good, right, it signed immediately. I wanted nothing more to do with me. I was out. My dad was pretty
[00:06:33] pissed though. He really wanted me to finish that last two years of college before I went
[00:06:38] up to the Marine Corps. And so he came home. He was, he was working on the pipeline at the time.
[00:06:42] Came home like a bad out of hell. And it was like, you know, argued with me the whole nine.
[00:06:46] And I just lied to my teeth and told him that I would do a dust job to give him a sign. I was like,
[00:06:50] look dude, you can sign the papers now or you can wait eight months. I'm going to sign him many ways
[00:06:54] myself. So he finally buckled. He trusted me, which that was a bad idea when I was 17.
[00:07:01] It's so strange when you look back. And I got, I got a son right now that's 16. And I'm thinking, wow,
[00:07:08] like, it, you grow up so much between the ages of 16, 17 and like, even 22 and then 22, 25,
[00:07:17] like, you don't know a lot when you're 17 years old. That's the bottom line. So I don't.
[00:07:22] But you, I mean, I will say this. Both your parents been Marines. One thing that's kind of cool is
[00:07:29] they at least knew what was going to happen. I mean, if you, if your parents didn't have any
[00:07:33] experience, they probably would have completely freaked out. But you at least know what the Marine
[00:07:38] Corps is. You know that it's, you know that it does what it does and it does it well. You know,
[00:07:43] the Marine Corps puts kids from every background, every walk of life, onto the path of being a
[00:07:52] Marine, which is a square-to-way thing to be in my opinion. Absolutely. How much of a shocker was
[00:07:58] it when you, how much longer was it until you went to boot camp? I went a few short months after that.
[00:08:04] Originally, I was going to try and hold out and it actually weight a little bit before my 18th birthday.
[00:08:09] But again, I got that little two-degree from Pensacola Junior College and had a little bit of
[00:08:14] free time started to get in trouble again. So it was just time to leave. How much of a shock was it
[00:08:23] for you checking into boot camp? You know, it's funny. I'll tell a quick story about my family or my
[00:08:29] parents because it's my hands down favorite story. But mom dad got married at 18,
[00:08:33] lived on a bar beach in Florida. Dad joins the Marine Corps right afterwards. Eight years later,
[00:08:39] I'm already born. We're living on 29 poms in California and my mom comes home and tells my dad,
[00:08:45] you know, I think these female Marines are pretty badass. Dad looks at moms as I'll never be married
[00:08:50] to a female Marine. Mom looks at him, turns around leaves, gets an age waiver and joins the Marine
[00:08:55] Corps. So like my earliest memory is actually, you know, my mom walking across the parade deck.
[00:09:02] Like so how old is your mom when she elucidated the Marine Corps? She would have been 26,
[00:09:06] 27. Yeah, that's the Marine Corps doesn't take people out of that old. That's like an ancient
[00:09:11] dinosaur in the Marine Corps to go to the home boot camp. Yeah, in boot camp they all called her mom.
[00:09:17] How long did your dad end up doing the Marine Corps? I'm using for nine years.
[00:09:21] And then what about your mom? She just did four. Part of it was a spite thing I think and then
[00:09:27] part of it, you know, she wanted to do it. I think she would live in regret if she didn't do it.
[00:09:31] Especially if her husband told her now. So that's the last five he did not. You knew where that
[00:09:38] was going. So so you check into the boot camp? Was it was it a shock to your sister? Did you
[00:09:45] be with your mom and dad both of these Marine Corps? Had they kind of
[00:09:49] given you a heads up, did you understand what you were getting into? And how much did it still shock you?
[00:09:54] Yeah, well I so I kid you not like I idolized my parents. You know, I just loved the fact that
[00:09:59] they got up every morning, put the uniform on and did something bigger than themselves.
[00:10:02] So I mean my favorite movie, I mean I got off the bus and watched documentaries on Marine Corps
[00:10:07] boot camp. You know, my Barbies were dressed and dressed blues. My favorite t-shirt was my mom's
[00:10:12] US Marine kind of thing. So I was very well educated and versed on what boot camp would consist of.
[00:10:17] And of course I heard all the stories from everybody. But I loved boot camp. I made it way harder
[00:10:22] on myself than I hated too, because I was again 17 years old and just a little shit. I you know,
[00:10:27] they'd say yell and I whispered just being just going to pain. But as far as like the physical
[00:10:33] aspect of it, you know, I just reminded myself like I'm getting to play for 13 weeks. Like
[00:10:38] where else do you get paid to run and throw grenades and you know, do the obstacle course?
[00:10:44] The was there anything you had trouble with in Marine Corps boot camp?
[00:10:49] I honestly I just had a head and issue just like I said breaking down my attitude.
[00:10:53] My attitude was you know, I wanted to say why do everything. And so that was when I say the
[00:10:58] hard part. Again, it was just yeah, keeping my head in the right place.
[00:11:04] And then how did you end up becoming like what was the process for you picking your MOS?
[00:11:12] Well, I wanted again, wanted something to challenge myself. You know, I didn't want to do
[00:11:16] supplier admin and I wanted to deploy. When I actually walked out of my class that I was in when I was 17,
[00:11:22] I very vividly remember looking around this chemistry lab and being like, he won't do it.
[00:11:27] She can't do it. There's no way in hell, he'll you know, he'll deploy or any of that. And
[00:11:31] obviously very terrible and judgmental of me. But I mean, that was the catalyst. I mean, that inspired
[00:11:35] me to walk out of that Kim Lab and go to the recruiter's office. What year was this? 2008.
[00:11:40] Oh, so you fall on new that you were going to go to unemployment to our acting Afghanistan.
[00:11:45] If you got a some kind of a job that would put you in the field in some way. Exactly.
[00:11:50] Yeah. And I wanted that. I mean, I growing up, I would like for for a long time, some of my family
[00:11:54] was like, oh, God, she's going to be a social worker. Because I just always loved like,
[00:11:58] I was the bully that beat up the bully. You know, I love protecting the kids that, you know,
[00:12:02] couldn't or wouldn't protect themselves. So yeah, when I went to the recruiter's office,
[00:12:06] I was like, you just got to give me something where I feel like I'm living that higher purpose.
[00:12:10] Or I know exactly without a doubt, you know, what my role in the grand scheme is.
[00:12:15] So yeah, and I went into the recruiter's office. I was like,
[00:12:17] from you, whatever you got. And then of course, the Azva, I had the scores to do whatever. And
[00:12:22] I knew nothing about aviation, but that's, that's what I went for.
[00:12:27] To become a, to become an airframe mechanic. That was the first step. See,
[00:12:31] and where is it? Isn't that school in Pensacola? It is.
[00:12:34] I'm looking to imagine how much trouble I got in again.
[00:12:41] When were you, do you remember September 11th?
[00:12:43] Yeah, I was in fifth grade, Mrs. Todd's class at WH Road in Milton, Florida.
[00:12:50] How much understanding did you have in what was happening?
[00:12:52] Were you parents selling the Marine Corps at the time?
[00:12:54] No, but my dad was actually working on the outskirts of New York City.
[00:13:00] And so I remember my mom picking me up. I mean,
[00:13:04] honestly, she was just petrified. She thought she was going to get,
[00:13:08] you know, stop lost. She thought she was going to get called back and she didn't know what to do.
[00:13:11] My dad's working in New York and you know, we're down in Florida. And I just remember laying
[00:13:15] on the carpet in front of a TV that wasn't even on a stand under this big blue jean,
[00:13:20] blanket, and just sitting there and crying and waiting to hear from my dad and figure out what's
[00:13:24] going on. So yeah, I mean, obviously very emotional. And then as you, I mean, going back a little
[00:13:32] bit, but when you're doing the Marine Corps, your parents absolutely know that in the Marine Corps,
[00:13:37] after September 11th, if you were in the Marine Corps, there was a really good chance you were
[00:13:42] going to Iraq or Afghanistan. And when what year was it you enlisted 2008? Yeah.
[00:13:51] So you go to Airframes School, how long is that school last? It's only a few months really,
[00:13:55] but it was hard to get classed up into it. But I was in the A school for like four months down there
[00:14:01] and then C-school over a new river for a couple of months. New river, what, where's that? It's
[00:14:07] right outside of the Lysun. Okay. And this is, you know, just for people that don't,
[00:14:13] for people that don't know too much about the military, I mean, the military is a massive
[00:14:18] organization that basically encompasses all of everything that happens in the world. So yes,
[00:14:25] you see Marines flying helicopters, but there's a Marine that knows how to work on that
[00:14:30] helicopter, there's a Marine that knows how to fix that helicopters and Marine that knows how to
[00:14:32] fuel that helicopters, Marines that know how to work on the electronics and there, and then there's
[00:14:37] people that know how to land it. There's, there's people that do everything and then there's people that
[00:14:42] supply the people that are doing all those things with the gear that they need and there's
[00:14:47] Marines that are in charge of edge can so there's this whole world inside of the military inside
[00:14:53] the Marine Corps. So, and you have to have it all in order in order to go forward and fight wars.
[00:14:59] There has to be all these different logistical support elements and equipment elements. I mean,
[00:15:07] it's just, it's just this massive machine and the army has the same thing and the navy obviously
[00:15:10] has the same thing with ships and planes and everything else. So, but what's cool is when you join
[00:15:15] the service as they used to say when I was a kid, do they still say that? Oh,
[00:15:20] I'll just go and join the service. I always felt like I was in a World War II and somebody asked me,
[00:15:25] hey, how's it being, how's it run in the service going? So, when you join the service,
[00:15:32] when you join the service, they give you some kind of a job and some kind of an education. So,
[00:15:36] that's what you were doing learning how to work on on the on the 53, right? That's your,
[00:15:41] is it specific to the 53? Yeah. So, you're learning specifically how to work on a specific aircraft
[00:15:47] that is used by the Marine Corps called the, what is the MH53? What's the Marine Corps version
[00:15:54] called? The CH 53. Big, awesome bird, powerful, massive bird helicopter that can hold
[00:16:03] 40 Marines. I'm gonna say. I'd have memorized all that stuff. So, my memories get in shady speaking
[00:16:11] of senior citizen over here. So, then where do you get stationed when you get done with these schools?
[00:16:17] My first situation was Miramar, actually. Oh, okay. Okay, really a good plane. Yeah.
[00:16:23] A little bit better than 29 pounds. A little bit better. So, and then what's your day-to-day life
[00:16:29] when you are, are you attached to a squadron? Is that what's going on? Yeah, so my first unit was
[00:16:34] having marine helicopter squadron 465. And to be totally honest, the Airframe shop didn't really
[00:16:41] want me there right off the bat. You know, throwing a female into a shop of all dudes, you're adding
[00:16:46] a pretty interesting dynamic. So, it was really a matter of, I had to prove myself, how to wear a
[00:16:52] chip on my shoulder and keep my head down. Again, gotten to my fair share of trouble as an 18-year-old
[00:16:57] in San Diego. I worked my way out of that, does to be compared. When I first got in the Navy and
[00:17:04] got to San Diego, there was a rule. The drinking age was 21 in California, but the drinking age on
[00:17:12] base was 18. So, like, yeah, you could do as kids that just had never drank before, just wrecking
[00:17:19] themselves. There was such a disaster. At some point, luckily, they changed it. So, you're in there,
[00:17:24] you're the first female you said that that was with this group. Yeah, and very, very long time,
[00:17:29] I've ever been. And then, I mean, that's when you're a new guy checking in. Anyways, it's going to be
[00:17:36] you're going to get, you're going to get, I guess, hazed is the politically incorrect work, right?
[00:17:41] We're not, because you're not allowed to haze, but you're going to get, is Razz okay? Is that the same thing?
[00:17:45] You're going to get Razz, you're going to get hassled, but when you're checking in somewhere,
[00:17:49] when you check in, are you guys already looking, are you already seeing a deployment ahead of you?
[00:17:54] So, when you check in on the, okay, we're going on deployment at this time? Right when I got there, I actually
[00:17:59] consider myself to have been getting lucky, because they were just leaving for a mu. So, I lucked out and
[00:18:03] missed the mu, and got to stick around, stick back, and actually learn my job, and become,
[00:18:09] become proficient in that, and then when the next cycle came around half of us went on a mu,
[00:18:13] then half of us went to Afghanistan, and I was lucky enough to go to Afghanistan. And then what was that
[00:18:18] deployment, when you were heading on that deployment, were you, what was your, what were your nerves,
[00:18:23] like, were you just like a typical 18 year old marine that's just fired up to go and get
[00:18:28] after it? Oh, I was super excited, honestly. Yeah, I mean, I was just ready to go. I mean,
[00:18:35] I think my bags were packed weeks in advance, but, and I don't even think the nerves kicked in about
[00:18:39] any of it up until you're starting to land, and you're doing your laps, that's when I got nervous.
[00:18:46] So, how did you, how did you guys get there? How did you guys deploy there?
[00:18:50] So, we came in on a segment 30. Okay, and the bird, the year helicopters were already there,
[00:18:55] yep. And so you were replacing basically replacing the group. Yep, exactly. And so you show up on the ground,
[00:19:02] and what was the day-to-day? What was your mission there? What were you doing?
[00:19:06] A day-to-day life. My first and second deployments were very different. The first one was, you know,
[00:19:12] super like maintenance, maintenance, and all the time. I mean, it was everything. I was usually
[00:19:18] night shift, but yeah, I mean, it was everything from doing the hydraulics to riveting,
[00:19:22] welding, composite repair, you know, battle damage assessments, stuff like that. You know,
[00:19:27] they trusted me enough to go out and do those jobs by myself, but not really enough to,
[00:19:32] to come outside of the wire or do anything like that. What was the optimal like, how often were
[00:19:36] the birds flying? Were they flying like every single day, all day? Every single day. I mean,
[00:19:42] oftentimes we'd send out seven or eight flights. And again, you know, birds don't fly out
[00:19:47] their single ship, so we need to have 14 aircraft down and have an adult do turn around some daily
[00:19:52] inspections to get them out the next day or even five, six hours later. And Marine Corps usually
[00:19:57] deploys for six months, was it a typical kind of six month deployment? Yep, seven.
[00:20:02] Seven month deployment, because there's a little bit on the beginning a little bit on the end.
[00:20:06] Were you, what was, were you getting sleep?
[00:20:10] Yeah, I mean, I mean, I had, I had, it was weird. I mean, I bet I know means,
[00:20:16] we're doing any of the things that you guys were doing. And I very much so loved the fact that
[00:20:21] my job was directly supporting the guys in the ground. I had such pride in that and I knew that
[00:20:25] if I didn't do my job, then again, like, you guys weren't going to be able to do your job.
[00:20:29] So I had a huge pride in that, but I did. I mean, I loved everything about being out there.
[00:20:35] You know, I love the, in my mind, simplicity of it, you know, you don't worry about how
[00:20:39] your hair is going to look. You don't worry about what you're going to wear, what you're going to
[00:20:41] eat. You know, you just worry about keeping birds up, stay in a lie, keeping your guys alive,
[00:20:45] and coming home safe. So to me, it was a very routine. I mean, even though your days are varied
[00:20:50] between, you know, what your maintenance schedule or what your flight schedule looks like,
[00:20:54] it's, I mean, it's pretty freaking straightforward. Yeah. And, and that's one of the things that I
[00:20:59] love always loved about deployment was you all have done nothing else in the world matters,
[00:21:03] except for this thing that you're doing. You're doing your job, whatever that job may be,
[00:21:07] whether it's fixed in a helicopter or going out on patrol, that's what your life is. And
[00:21:13] like you said, there, there are lives to stick. I mean, with your job, you know, everyone's relying
[00:21:19] on those helicopters. Everyone's relying on those helicopters to do what they need to do to provide
[00:21:24] extract insert helicopter, casualty evacuation. I mean, it's absolutely critical in every single
[00:21:31] person that it plays a role in making sure that those things do what they're supposed to do. It's like,
[00:21:36] yeah, it's absolutely critical. And that becomes your whole life. That becomes your whole focus. And it's,
[00:21:41] it feels good in my opinion when you have that much focus and clarity in your life.
[00:21:49] Yeah. No, I mean, I loved it. I mean, that's why I had three months between deployments,
[00:21:53] four months between deployments. So you come home from that first deployment and what gave you
[00:21:58] because normally the Marine court takes what 12 months to 18 months between deployments for
[00:22:03] whatever unit, somehow you end up going switching to another unit, what happened here?
[00:22:08] Yeah. So towards the end of, well, towards the second half of that first deployment in May of
[00:22:14] about 2011, my former gunnerry sergeant, Richard, when he said, hey, you know, I want you to come
[00:22:18] back to Afghanistan with my unit. What do you think? Initially, I was like, get bent and do. There's
[00:22:23] no way I'm coming back here. Like, I need a break. But sure enough, got home August 2011. You know,
[00:22:29] what I'm leaving with family and then in June, or excuse me, in September 2011 was down in K-bay.
[00:22:36] I won't complain about that with heavy marine helicopter scrogen 362. And then we were right back
[00:22:42] in Afghanistan. Yeah. Jen, end of January 2012. And then what did that deployment look like?
[00:22:48] That's when I actually was able to step up and, you know, could be proud of those
[00:22:53] combat action wings. And that's when I was actually, you know, a 50-calber machine gunner, aerial
[00:22:57] door gunner. And again, you know, I'm still trying to rentures and maintaining the aircraft that I'm
[00:23:01] playing on. But to me, I was in my opinion, I was feeling a much bigger purpose. You know, again,
[00:23:08] the things that you were just rattling off, whether it's, you know, sitting there on trapstand
[00:23:12] by waiting for a metavacter get called in or an insertion or extraction. You know, you're just,
[00:23:18] in my opinion, it was just way more high speed, low drag. So you're still doing your maintenance job.
[00:23:23] Yeah. And then your, your other job is when they launch some of the times they would need a
[00:23:32] door gunner and they put you on the 50-cal. Yeah. Well, I mean, so it's a routine thing. So it
[00:23:36] probably every other day. And once every three days I'd be flying. Okay. Yeah. So it was just like
[00:23:40] here, your schedule for flights these days. Yeah. And, and then what kind of missions were you
[00:23:45] guys supporting? It could be a broad spectrum of things. Yeah. I mean, some days it would be just your
[00:23:50] generic like, resupplies or your drop-in-off mail, other times, you know, you're doing everything
[00:23:55] from drug grades to yeah, I mean, my favorites were the insertions and extractions for sure.
[00:24:01] And did you already knew how to shoot a 50-cal, but did they fan you up further once you
[00:24:07] started doing it from the heel? Oh yeah. I mean, I loved it. They got you dialed in. Yeah, because
[00:24:11] the 50-cal is such a beautiful piece of machinery. Well, it was funny too. Well, man,
[00:24:17] when I first decided that I wanted to pick at my wings, like that was even more of a battle than
[00:24:23] you know, even just being a maintainer. Like nobody wants to see a 5-3-blond lady, you know,
[00:24:28] drag in their knuckles and turn and rents as long as I had the dudes. And then now she steps up
[00:24:32] and says she wants to do speed reloads with 85 pound cans and they start looking at you a little
[00:24:35] funny. So again, proving myself all over again, but I mean, I loved it. Like even when you go pick
[00:24:42] up, you know, the boys from one seven or two five are something they'd just be looking at you.
[00:24:45] So funny with a little blonde ponytail hanging out the back of the flight helmet. I mean, I just
[00:24:50] yeah, I loved it. And then what? So every third day you're going out the other days you're working
[00:24:56] and the missions that you're supporting are everything. Everything. I mean, we would work with
[00:25:02] the Marines, we'd work with the Australians, we'd work with the Brits. I mean, the Georgians would work
[00:25:06] with everybody. How hot was the AOs that you were working in? Like, what was the threat level? How did
[00:25:12] you feel? Did you feel? Were you ever at a point where like, oh yeah, we know we're going out,
[00:25:17] we're no we're going to get contacted or was it the enemy was pretty tame in the areas you were going
[00:25:23] into? It was going to hit and mess. I would go back and forth. I mean, you mentioned the 53 earlier.
[00:25:28] I mean, we're a huge bumblebee. We're a huge target as it is. You know, certain areas, you know,
[00:25:33] Lashcarga, you know, I'm Lisa Kloan, all of that, like sure those areas, like for lack of better
[00:25:39] terms. Yeah, I mean, you'd you'd pucker, like I mean, it's very real. I mean, other times, you know,
[00:25:43] going on a Dwyer, not so bad. And then the the did you start feeling any any like stress or were
[00:25:53] you like just in the zone? Well, it's weird. Like, I never really thought about getting hurt.
[00:26:00] Ever. I mean, I don't know if maybe it was a young mentality, but I mean, every day when I'd go pick
[00:26:05] up my bloodshit and you know, grab the gear and run out of the bird, it was, I mean, crashing or
[00:26:10] getting shut down or any of those things like never even crossed my mind. It was just,
[00:26:14] I'm going to go out there and do my job. And quite frankly, I mean, flying over, you know,
[00:26:19] anywhere, saying in or any of those areas, the greens on like Afghanistan is beautiful. Like,
[00:26:24] if you're not getting shot at, you're not terrified. Like, I mean, I loved it. I mean, it's
[00:26:29] just a stunning country. And then even just like the interaction that you get with some of the people,
[00:26:33] I mean, it's pretty special. Sometimes. So then you never expected, you never thought about it.
[00:26:43] You never thought about it. You never thought about getting blown out of the sky. You never thought
[00:26:45] about it any of this stuff. And then all of a sudden, let's talk about June 23rd, 2012. So
[00:26:51] what's the mission where you're going out on? So we were actually doing a resupply and then we were
[00:26:56] dropping off three space available army medics. And then we were going out bound to do an extraction
[00:27:01] of Marines. So a little bit of everything. I mean, that's pretty common. You just bundle it all together
[00:27:05] and try to meet the schedules that everybody needs. But I mean, honestly, it should have been fairly
[00:27:10] routine. So we were making our way to now Zad. And there's a little bit of stuff going on. Like,
[00:27:16] we were getting spotlighted. So it's common out in Afghanistan where basically they try to
[00:27:20] bloom out the hull of the copper, so the pads can't see anyways. But they would basically signal
[00:27:24] to the next stations all the way out to wherever we were going. So they could figure out where we were
[00:27:27] landing. We were in route to now Zad and unfortunately never made it to who now Zad. We were supposed
[00:27:34] to be dropping off those three army medics and everything from ammo to mail and everything in between.
[00:27:40] And yeah, the last things that I remember was a pilot or my excuse me, my tail gunner calling
[00:27:46] for power. For the pilots to level the nose of the aircraft up are off. And pilot came over
[00:27:53] comms and said he wasn't getting the desired outputs. And the next thing, you know, we came
[00:27:57] nose up and then rolled left and being on the left gun night vision goggles down. It was weird.
[00:28:04] I just counted. Like, just like normally, like as a as a door gunner, you're the eyes and the
[00:28:08] ears for the pilot. So when you're landing, especially a big piece of machinery like that,
[00:28:12] it's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 means on deck. And that's all I did. And then we hit the ground.
[00:28:19] You know, there's a lot more embellished stories out there. But yeah, not that bad.
[00:28:22] You remember all that stuff? Yeah. That's what I remember. There's a lot that I was knocked out.
[00:28:30] The assumption is the barrel of my 50 cow, which obviously sticks way up the side of the helicopter,
[00:28:34] hit the ground before I did and came up in through my face. So it has some pretty,
[00:28:39] pretty severe damage to my face and then my right front a lube. But yeah, I'm going to listen
[00:28:43] in out. Did you ever piece together with the pilots like what happened?
[00:28:46] I think I made in my opinion, you just choked. I mean, there was pressure. I mean, it was,
[00:28:54] you know, brown-out circumstances. We were being spotted. There was smaller stuff going on around
[00:28:59] us. Nothing that was a real threat to us by any means. But, you know, actually, my last memory of
[00:29:06] being an afghanist and on camp bastions, it'll make shit possible. I once had his name, but
[00:29:12] was the pilot sitting by my bedside and just sitting there and crying. And then I found out later
[00:29:18] that he actually deal with. So, and there's a lot of guilt there. I mean, I've forgiven the situation
[00:29:24] for sure. But yeah. So, the hero crashes and you're knocked out. What's your first memory
[00:29:33] of after being knocked out? So everybody, like my pilots were screaming for my tail gunner,
[00:29:39] and who, I mean, I just idolized this dude. And they couldn't find him. They couldn't get a reaction
[00:29:46] from him at first. So, I started screaming. Like, I'm hearing all this going on. And it's not real.
[00:29:50] I wasn't in pain. I wasn't in shock. I wasn't crying. It was just like, holy shit. Find my tail
[00:29:55] gunner. And I don't know the details of what exactly happened or how exactly it happened.
[00:30:01] But he ended up going at the back and hitting the river rocks before we actually hit the ground.
[00:30:05] I don't know if he was coming off of his gunner's belt to get to one of the three available seats
[00:30:09] on the other side of the aircraft or what he was doing. But he went up the back. And so I just
[00:30:14] started screaming to get a reaction, likely over time. They got a reaction from him. And like,
[00:30:20] all of it was just pure freaking chaos. But I remember like rolling my tongue around my mouth.
[00:30:25] Because I couldn't breathe out of my nose. And then we're no teeth. Everything was shattered.
[00:30:28] There's just like a big hole. And then it was just gurgling. Because I couldn't breathe out of my mouth.
[00:30:34] And one of the army medics actually crawled all over all of these trials that we had and got
[00:30:39] in my face. And I remember reading his patch. And he was just doing my face trying to keep me
[00:30:45] basically out of shock. And then they called in. It says, when my favorite story is so I hope second
[00:30:50] I'm Italian fifth moon is listening. But they called two five out of Nazad to come out and provide
[00:30:56] security. And obviously, you know, help with stripping everything down. And when they called it in,
[00:31:02] um, whoever said it, you know, said, you know, the female gunner that on impact. Because it couldn't
[00:31:08] get a response for me. Long search for it. They come out, you know, put me in the other craft or
[00:31:13] lead aircraft along with my tail gunner. And there's the crew and get us out of there and back to
[00:31:18] camp bastion. Well, long search for it all fast for a little bit. Um, second time fifth marines
[00:31:24] ended up shooting these pistol rounds underwater when they, when that's done, they blew
[00:31:28] them out into flowers. And they got them back to me in this little wooden case and said for
[00:31:32] what, um, flowers that I don't ever die just like you. Um, but yeah, I mean, every single one of
[00:31:37] those dudes now to this day, like they laughed early, we didn't think it was true. I really bullshit.
[00:31:41] There's not a female on that aircraft. So, it was the, whenever I think of a helicopter crashing,
[00:31:49] I think of it exploding and being on fire. So, how did it not? Was it, what did it survive kind of
[00:31:57] intact? No. Okay. So, it was just, you know, so I actually have a little bit of, um, I, there was a
[00:32:07] g-boss out right outside and now is that. So, I have actually seen what happened when we hit the ground.
[00:32:12] So, when we hit the ground, the transition, the transition came off and of course, like the
[00:32:16] tailpile and everything just went flying. Um, the rotors and all of that. Um, but I mean, it wasn't
[00:32:22] salvageable. I mean, they just took the guns and a couple of other things off of it and then they just
[00:32:27] blow it up. And you were the worst injury, worst casualty on the heel, right? Yes. And that's
[00:32:34] probably because, like you said, you were the door gunner on the, on the left side and on the left side.
[00:32:39] And to be totally honest, probably just because of my size. I mean, my 50 cow on a gal 21
[00:32:43] mill, you know, sits up. Damn, no, my chest on me. So, you've got some pictures on your,
[00:32:49] I think it's your Facebook of your face and it's freaking crazy. I was like, holy, I mean, it is,
[00:32:57] it's like fully exposed. Like, your, your, your, your, your, your, her bad, yeah, bad. And um,
[00:33:06] so, so what then once your next memory, once your next memory, did they put you in a induced
[00:33:09] coma? What they do with you? No, they didn't give me any medicine. Oh, piss me off. I saw
[00:33:15] so much pain. Does I woke back up, um, in round two camp, bastion. And this dude, calm stock. He was
[00:33:23] the, the new left door gunner on the other aircraft. He bent on next to me. And he just basically told me
[00:33:30] he's like, don't close your fucking eyes because you're not going to open him again. And um,
[00:33:34] my tail gunner, my old gunner, he's sergeant. It was actually laying next to me because we were just
[00:33:39] laying on the floorboard of the aircraft. And he kept throwing his arm over my face to keep from
[00:33:43] getting hydraulic and fluid and stuff. All in my open wounds and whatnot. And so I'm laying there
[00:33:48] and I'm trying not to cry. I'm panicking that like I'm going to die of that same little sister
[00:33:52] because I have no idea what's going on. Like I was numb. I knew I was hurt, but I didn't really,
[00:33:57] I was weird. I couldn't feel anything. And then I just kept staring at this blue cabin over
[00:34:01] headlight and thinking I wasn't going to die of that same little sister. What about your leg? Did
[00:34:05] you, did you, what do you aware that your leg was jacked up? I was well aware that I was jacked up
[00:34:10] because that was, I mean, I wasn't paying like that's the only thing that actually hurt.
[00:34:14] For whatever reason, like I could feel that in nothing else. Yeah, that was just, that was pretty brutal.
[00:34:22] But yeah, then they got me back to camp bastion. And I remember thinking like,
[00:34:28] that's fucking fine. Like they're just going to sew me back up. And I'm going to go right back to this.
[00:34:31] Like out were almost on our way out. We're going to, you know, go home and August. It's totally fine.
[00:34:35] And then my gunnery sergeant, the one who asked me to go on that deployment. My sergeant
[00:34:40] major at the time walked in and they were looking at me and they're both crying and just staring at me.
[00:34:46] I'm like, oh shit. This is, this is not good. And I think that's when I realized like I was going home.
[00:34:54] And yeah, I mean, I was devastated. I think that was the hardest part of any of it was just having to leave
[00:35:00] everybody behind. I mean, even once I left camp bastion, you know, they said me to candle hard,
[00:35:04] Germany, D.C. and then I made it back to San Diego. And I had been, I had just been combat
[00:35:10] meritoriously promoted to sergeant. And then... When you're getting the whole evacuation to Germany,
[00:35:18] are people meeting with you? Are you starting to get a glimpse or are feeling for what's going on?
[00:35:23] Yes, and no. I mean, I knew what was going on. I didn't quite understand obviously the whole process.
[00:35:32] But I was pissed off and I wasn't really letting anyone help or explain to me anything.
[00:35:38] Actually, it didn't really help the situation. Sorry, Mom. But when I was in, it would have
[00:35:43] been Germany or candle hard. They finally let me call home because of course my CEO gets a
[00:35:48] hold of my parents and my dad answers the phone well. Eventually I can call home. But I can't talk
[00:35:53] because there's no genre or anything. So I'm trying to tell my mom like I'm coming home and my mom
[00:36:00] starts laughing at me and she's like, you know, baby girl, I can understand you must be on some
[00:36:03] really good drugs and I get pissed. I do mom and I hang up the phone on her. And then I don't talk
[00:36:09] to anybody. Like I'm not mad. And then, you know, they're loading me up, like, and pissed off
[00:36:14] at my mom. I'm anger that I'm even my dudes. Like, I'm just, I'm just a shitshow. And then they
[00:36:20] load me up to actually, they don't have me and do. They don't have me sedated or anything. They
[00:36:25] load me up in Germany to send me to DC. Why don't they have you induced? Is it because you had
[00:36:29] brain trauma or something? Yeah. So they wouldn't give me anything for pain right off the bat,
[00:36:33] especially because of the head trauma. But yeah. So then from Germany, somebody that was just in a
[00:36:40] helicopter crash, they don't put them to sleep for a flight from Germany to DC. And so then I'm on this
[00:36:45] thing. Like, they have me strapped down to a gurney. There's a bunch of other dudes with like,
[00:36:48] they'll legs blown off. People sitting on the sides of the aircraft, like just staring at me as I'm
[00:36:52] losing my mind. My lungs are sticking together. So it can't breathe. I mean, it was, it was a terrible
[00:36:59] terrible journey back. Let's put it that way. But I think once I made it to DC and they, you know,
[00:37:04] they're carrying us all off on the stretchers and stuff like that. And, you know, there's American
[00:37:08] flags and supporters and people out there, you know, telling you that it's going to be okay. I
[00:37:12] think in that moment, like, I realized that I was going to be okay. But it still didn't quite.
[00:37:19] I think I was scared of what was going happen. You know, basically that I wouldn't be able to stay in.
[00:37:25] That was the fear. That was the fear. The fear that you couldn't, you wouldn't be able to stay in
[00:37:29] the Marine Corps. How long had you been in for at this point? Four years.
[00:37:33] Just made sergeant. Yep. Were your parents waiting for you when you got to DC?
[00:37:40] No, they're waiting for me in San Diego. So it was hard for them to decide, you know, of course,
[00:37:45] both Marines being our both parents being Marines. It's not a ton of money floating around my family.
[00:37:50] So they, you know, we need to do a wait to figure out if I was going to be a poly trauma in DC,
[00:37:55] our poly trauma in San Diego. So as soon as we got word that I was going to go to San Diego,
[00:38:00] that's when they like sold everything in the house. You know, we loaded up in the car and
[00:38:03] are they loaded up in the car and they made it out of San Diego. Did they actually sell their house?
[00:38:07] No, they did everything in it, literally everything in it. And we're, they down and forward to
[00:38:13] still. Yeah. So they sold everything that they had to float up. How long were you in DC for?
[00:38:17] Not too long. I mean, I maybe a handful of days, four, five days. And then straight to Balbo.
[00:38:24] And what do you think in at this point in terms of the level of your injuries? Have you seen
[00:38:28] yourself in a mirror yet? Because if I would have seen the picture that you posted,
[00:38:32] that would have hit me pretty damn hard. Well, so that's actually why they took those pictures.
[00:38:37] So it was actually really cute when when I got what was in San Cue.
[00:38:40] I don't know what's cute about this. You had a hole in your face. No.
[00:38:45] So when they wheeled me in, again, this little makeshift hospital tent. There was actually a
[00:38:51] British plastic surgeon that was volunteering or time. This little suy, she was old, like an old
[00:38:56] lady. And she looked at everybody in there and was like, no one touch her. I'm so in her back up.
[00:39:01] So it was, you know, as far as my face goes. And so she took those pictures. And when I finally
[00:39:07] came to after she sewed my face up initially, she was like, I don't want you to freak out when you
[00:39:12] see this. Like, this is what we started with. And so that's where those pictures actually came from.
[00:39:18] No, that's their savage. Yeah. But so you saw those pretty quickly. Yeah. But then you got to see
[00:39:25] she did a damn good job. Yeah. I mean, it's like a miracle. She was a miracle or something.
[00:39:29] Lady. I'm just so thankful. A corpsman didn't touch me. My team was being a human eye.
[00:39:34] You had to had a E3 corpsman. Yeah, that would have been better. That would have not been good.
[00:39:39] No offense to E3 corpsman. They're doing their best. But, you know, obviously,
[00:39:43] a some experienced plastic surgeon is going to do a better job. Yeah. I was out of rough.
[00:39:48] So, so that's good. How about your leg? When are you feeling in your leg?
[00:39:52] So, my leg, I knew was a bad deal from the get go. So, they had no body would touch it. No one
[00:39:58] overseas, he would even was willing to mess with that. What had happened to it? So, when we hit
[00:40:04] the ground, there's a bone in the middle of your foot called a tailist. It snapped and shot everything
[00:40:10] up. So, damn, it's just the heel and up through like my tip to have been everything.
[00:40:15] Something, I don't know what it was. I mean, obviously, they have steel to a boot. So, we fly in and
[00:40:19] all of that. But, yeah, something was underneath it with enough force that it broke everything
[00:40:24] upward and pushed everything up. And, what does it look like on the outside? Is it like a compound
[00:40:32] fractures at all internal damage? No, I mean, it was all internal damage. I mean,
[00:40:37] everything. I mean, there was no, from my leg, there was no blood. Did it seem, because it
[00:40:42] seems to me that that would, like if I had that happen, like, oh, it hurts a lot, but it's all
[00:40:46] there. There's no blood. I'm going to be good. That would be my opinion, because I'm kind of,
[00:40:52] I always think I'm going to survive everything. Yeah, no, I hear it. No, like, well, I think what
[00:40:57] worried me was, like I said, the fact that everybody was looking at it and being like,
[00:41:02] we're not going to do anything about it. And nobody did anything about it for like a week,
[00:41:05] ten days. And then, finally, someone came in and said, well, this is what your deal is,
[00:41:10] because of the damage that has been caused. You've disrupted all of the blood flow to those bones.
[00:41:15] So those bones are going to have a vast enough process, and they're all going to die. And I opted
[00:41:20] for the doctors to not cut it off right away. I told them, like, look, let's fix my spine.
[00:41:25] Let's fix my face. Let's fix my fucking brain. And then, making a worry about my leg. And
[00:41:31] so let's go through that order. The face, they sew you up, did a great job with that.
[00:41:38] Your brain. So you got knocked out. You got, I mean, you got,
[00:41:42] wailed on. Your head got wailed on in this accident. What do you got? You get headaches?
[00:41:47] Is your memory? What, what would the symptoms that you noticed out of the gate?
[00:41:53] The biggest thing, right? I mean, currently, the biggest thing is still my memory. Like, I mean,
[00:41:56] I have solid chunks of it. And I like made a really conscious effort and thank God for,
[00:42:00] again, my mom, my sister and my dad for really working with me for that stuff. But for a while,
[00:42:07] I mean, it was, I mean, everything. The biggest thing was being able to control my mood. I had a
[00:42:11] real issue with mood stabilization. There was just like a constant anxiety no matter what. And then
[00:42:16] I couldn't sleep. So of course, all of those things together on top of like word recognition
[00:42:21] and word retrieval and being able to communicate effectively with doctors or your parents or friends,
[00:42:25] like what you need. That was the hardest part. And then like, I don't know if you've ever been
[00:42:30] down to Valbo, but I mean, they had this whole building for their patients to live. And so I lived in,
[00:42:36] I mean, it was just like a little bedroom. Like a little tiny condo thing. But I could go into the
[00:42:41] bathroom and just not know what the hell was going on. Like I had to be reminded that if I'm in the
[00:42:45] bathroom, I'm taking a shower, but she might take the washing my hands. So like I had to have a very
[00:42:52] specific routine to be able to like get all pistons firing.
[00:42:58] Is that, did you, did you notice progress over time? Oh yeah. So you could you see the progress?
[00:43:05] I guess is what I'm asking. Or were you just like, what is this not getting any better?
[00:43:09] The first year, I really, really struggled because you get frustrated. You compare yourself to
[00:43:15] how you were, whether that's physically, mentally or emotionally. It's just, if it's not one thing,
[00:43:21] it's another. So I was the first year was really, really difficult, but once I made it over that hump,
[00:43:27] I mean, I'm pretty broad to say that it's been like, and I've tried like hell. I've given this
[00:43:31] everything that I have that has been like on a constant upswing at this point. I mean, I still
[00:43:37] would have speech therapy to this day, but I mean, that helps with everything from cognitive to,
[00:43:42] again, just the verbal stuff too. But I mean, it's, it's work. How about the cervical spine? What,
[00:43:50] like, what was the, what you feeling numbness in your body parts or anything like that? Like, I had,
[00:43:54] I had neck surgery because I hurt my spine. And like I had woke up one day and I, in the middle
[00:44:00] night, I couldn't move my right arm. Like, it would not move, which isn't really scary thing. And,
[00:44:04] you know, eventually it all came back, but what, what was your cervical spine injury? Did you break
[00:44:09] vertebrae? So there was herelin fractures in my C2C3 and C4. And then just from the, so like,
[00:44:16] being in the air craft, there are these, I mean, there are tethers. I mean, they go around your ribcage
[00:44:21] and tether you to the floor board, so you don't go flying anywhere, or should it hollow copper crash or something
[00:44:25] happened. And so when we hit the ground, it was like the hollow cup, it went one way and I went the other.
[00:44:30] And so it kind of just like, I guess, be severe, whip last. Beggah, whip last. Yeah. And so then my,
[00:44:38] C2C3 and C4 did what's called stepping. So they were basically, say exact, one was out of place.
[00:44:44] So that was for that way. Did, but it didn't, did it affect your spinal cord at all? No. No.
[00:44:51] I, I like to gain a millimetres right there too. And I, that was scary. Let me just put it that way. And I mean,
[00:44:58] I, I didn't know what to do in that moment either because now you're playing with, again,
[00:45:03] no offense to millimetres. And I'm super thankful that I am where I am today. But now you're looking at this
[00:45:07] situation where it's like, is it that bad to fix it? You know, do you let them go on and do surgery or
[00:45:12] do you let it heal on its own? Do you live your life in a cease-bying for the next year or two? And so yeah,
[00:45:18] I mean, that's just a huge gamble with all of it. So what called did you make? I lived in a cease-bying
[00:45:23] for a long time. So you lived in a dang, that big thing that you wear around your neck? So yeah, you're not
[00:45:28] turning it and you're not moving your shoulders around your neck. You're doing nothing. Yeah.
[00:45:35] And then, you know, obviously, damage to the arms, the head drum will also like mess up the back side of my
[00:45:40] right eye. Of course, you're your drum. You're going to get blown out and all that good stuff and how
[00:45:44] look up your crash. But the hardest part for me, I know, I think all two of them people look at me.
[00:45:48] Like, oh, God, she's missing her left leg that has to be terrible. But the reality is if I didn't
[00:45:53] keep my head in my heart in the right place, then nothing else was going to get better. So fixing,
[00:45:58] fixing my brain and fixing what I had going on emotionally. That was the hard part.
[00:46:04] So you're in the hospital for like, how long are you in the hospital for? Two years.
[00:46:10] Two years from 2012 to 2014. When you're when you're going through one of the things that you
[00:46:20] talk about is you're going through your anniversary, is it called an anniversary? You're a live day,
[00:46:28] a year after. And you got to a point where you're like, I don't know if I can do this.
[00:46:34] Yeah. So I think my doctors and my leadership, if you will, I had a lot of people come into my
[00:46:45] hospital room and sit there and tell me, I wanted to go to the drill field so bad, so freaking bad.
[00:46:51] So I had all of these people coming. I even had the CG of MCRD come over and say,
[00:46:58] you're going to be the first drill instructor that's an MPT and you're going to go right back
[00:47:01] into the fight and this, that and the other and on one hand, I used that to really push myself
[00:47:06] physically to get better, but on the other hand, I think it messed that misled me quite a bit.
[00:47:11] So when I got word after my second med board that I was unfit for duty,
[00:47:17] two to the injuries, I lost it. That's when I knew that I had one more shot at staying in the
[00:47:23] Marine Corps and it wasn't going to ever be to fly again. I was going to be the desk job that I
[00:47:28] really didn't want from the get-go and even still, I mean that wasn't even promised. So I don't know.
[00:47:34] I deal with injuries in specific the main leg that's not getting better. Obviously,
[00:47:39] still processing a ton of stuff and then finding out that this, the one thing that I really
[00:47:43] loved at that point in time, my purpose, was now getting pulled out from underneath my feet.
[00:47:50] Yeah, I mean, I guess you, you have to hit rock bottom, you know, to be able to rebuild everything
[00:47:56] and I truly did. You got a couple of things in here that that you wrote about just like your,
[00:48:06] your mom, your dad. He said, my dad's been one of my best friends and biggest friends since day one.
[00:48:11] He's given me tough love after injury, but also motivated me in ways to continue creating and chasing
[00:48:17] dreams. I'm alive and well. Thanks to my family. I appreciate you being as stubborn as I am, Dad.
[00:48:23] You, you, you, uh, talk about your mom. He said, my mom used to look at me sitting in my wheelchair
[00:48:29] and say, do it your damn self. That right there has got to be for a parent and I got four
[00:48:38] kids, but the temptation for parents always is to try and just take give your kids everything that
[00:48:44] you can to help them. And that, I've said many times, actually, hurts your kid and here's an example,
[00:48:50] not of a child, but of hit of your mom talking to a 20, whatever three-year-old woman
[00:48:57] and saying, you got to do this yourself. That has to leave a mark. Yeah, I am. I mean, I'm not a
[00:49:04] parent, so I don't, I don't totally get that, you know, that side of things, but I mean, my dad,
[00:49:11] again, one of the things, I mean, I'll get into the nitty-goody of it because I'm transparent,
[00:49:17] but so on, June 23, 2012, like, if you're going to kill yourself, you're not going to,
[00:49:22] you're not going to tell anybody. You're just going to go off and do it. And so I went down to
[00:49:28] the Blife River and had some friends with me because we're going to celebrate and all this stuff.
[00:49:32] And then I decided that I'm over it, like, I don't want to be doing it anymore. Do what I need to do,
[00:49:38] and I'm going to walk myself out into the Blife River and drive myself disappear and no one's
[00:49:44] going to have to deal with me or my problems. I'm not going to be a burden anymore.
[00:49:50] Long search for it. I'm lucky that I woke up the next day. It's surrounded by people that did save
[00:49:55] me and my dad came to me and crying. My dad doesn't cry. My dad's this big tattoo dude. That's
[00:50:05] some of my scary sometimes. And he said, you've got to be shit in me. You know, the enemy couldn't kill
[00:50:09] you. You made it home. Now you're going to do it for him. And that's the moment I realized that I was
[00:50:14] being selfish. Some moment that I realized that I had a lot more to live for and that I had a lot to be
[00:50:18] grateful for. So then I decided that I was going to turn my life around. But I mean, I don't know
[00:50:27] what that's like for my dad. Especially like he's always been hard on me. He's always been the
[00:50:33] one to really set those standards for me. I mean, pun intended like he's the reason that I hold,
[00:50:38] you know, he holds my foot to the fire for me. And even to this day, like he doesn't do interviews.
[00:50:43] You know, I'm constantly like doing media stuff here and there. But, you know, one day he was asked,
[00:50:49] you know, are you proud of your daughter? And he's like, well, yeah, I'm proud of her. But the moment
[00:50:53] she stops paying it forward, she deserves it. I'll take it away. And I have lived my life like that.
[00:50:58] You know, those little one liners, it's sometimes look at my dad and I'm like, oh, like, thanks.
[00:51:03] But you know, like I hang on to those. And I mean, he really is. He's the one that holds me accountable
[00:51:08] like through and through through all of it. And then my mom, God love her.
[00:51:11] Toffers lady, I know. Because again, even like raising me. But then for her to like, I mean, I could see it.
[00:51:18] Even those moments when she's telling me to do it myself, like there's tears in her eyes. Like she
[00:51:21] wants to do it for me. But she knows the moment that she steps in and, and, you know,
[00:51:25] cuddles the situation. I'm not going to be independent. You know, I'm not going to move past these
[00:51:29] injuries and live a healthy, happy life. So I mean, I can't imagine the internal, like, turmoil that
[00:51:35] you go through and I'm going to start the battle. And for you to go through this, like, actual 180 degree
[00:51:43] transition from, I don't want to live anymore to, I want to live the best life I possibly can.
[00:51:53] Well, how long did that transition take? This is like a couple days that you went,
[00:51:57] got there. When your dad said those words to you, you just said, you know what? I'm wrong.
[00:52:04] And I need to get on the right path. That's it. He said, I mean, I think I think in that moment, I
[00:52:11] throw whatever reason. I mean, I'll never understand it. But for whatever reason, at that time,
[00:52:17] God spared me twice. And I'm not even a religious person. But God spared me twice. So obviously,
[00:52:21] there's a reason that I'm still here. Somebody is something cut me here. And then the dude that I,
[00:52:28] you know, was just back to the admire the most coming to me and saying that, like, I mean,
[00:52:32] that just destroyed me. I mean, as if I couldn't get any lower, you know, him saying that I was like,
[00:52:37] you know what? You decide. Like, I can't control the Holocaust or crash. I can't control what
[00:52:43] this crazy vicious world threw out me. I can't control that. But what I can't control is how I'm
[00:52:48] going to respond. And it is. I mean, I, I wholeheartedly believe as a choice.
[00:52:55] When you were not to dwell in the subject too long, but, you know, the lot of people that listen to
[00:53:02] this podcast are people that served and people that end up in some rough spots. When you were
[00:53:09] descending into that place mentally, how long did that take? I mean, is it something that you woke
[00:53:15] up one day and said, I'm sick of this or is it was like just the grind that beat you down over time.
[00:53:20] We said, look, this is just not worth it right now. I was the grind. I mean, it's not, I mean,
[00:53:26] it's not an instant thing. I mean, again, don't get me wrong. I'm not the person that walked
[00:53:30] trying to talk to about it. Like, you know, I wasn't screaming for attention. I was just going to
[00:53:32] go and do it. But I mean, it was just one of those things where it felt like nothing was ever getting
[00:53:38] better. You know, it was just digging this whole digging this grave, you know, deeper and deeper.
[00:53:43] You know, I asked you about the progress of your injury. That was like actually a really personal
[00:53:50] question for me because I'm the type of person. If I notice 0.001% improvement is something, I'm like,
[00:53:59] oh, there you go. See? I'm not right. This is going to get better. And when I don't have that happening,
[00:54:05] that's that's like, when I don't have that happening, I, it's like, when I don't notice any
[00:54:10] improvement, I, I start feeling like, oh, no, like I can see, I'm on the wrong path right now. This is
[00:54:14] not going to get better. It's kind of like how I felt with with my neck, my neck, I've jacked up all
[00:54:19] of this and I can't move my arm all sudden. You know, it's going to get better. It's going to get better.
[00:54:22] It's not getting better. And yeah, that's the grind thing of like, hey, this is getting worse.
[00:54:32] And it's not going to get better. And for me, like, now when I look at like, I never recovered
[00:54:37] the strength that I have in my, in my right tricep and my right pack. Like, I got some of it back,
[00:54:42] but not all of it. And it's okay. At some point, I just was like, okay, cool. That's the way it is.
[00:54:47] And I think that happens to people where you have to, you have to look at the situation and say,
[00:54:53] well, it's what you just said, listen, I can't control that. I can't control what happened.
[00:54:56] I can't control what happened. I can't control what happened. This helicopter crash.
[00:54:58] What happened happened? What are we going to do now? And I got that. I was actually getting some
[00:55:04] social media responses about it. Just someone is talking about, so I mean, my buddy,
[00:55:11] life, who is on the seal teams with, we wrote a book called Extreme Ownership and it's like,
[00:55:14] you take ownership of everything in your world. Right? And there's people that will say,
[00:55:20] oh, if you get cancer, how you're going to take ownership of that, how is that? Because, yeah,
[00:55:24] when something goes wrong, it's my fault. That's, that's the way I look at things. Right?
[00:55:26] When something goes wrong, it's my fault. That's the way I look at everything. If something's
[00:55:30] not going the way it should be, it's my fault. So how do you take ownership if you get cancer?
[00:55:38] Like how do you take ownership of that? And the answer is, you don't take ownership
[00:55:42] for getting cancer. That's not, that's not, but you take ownership for how you're going to react to it.
[00:55:48] You take ownership for your response. You can't take ownership. Look, the hellow crashed.
[00:55:53] What, for whatever reason, it could be a million different things that that he'll crash to. He'll
[00:55:57] crash. You, okay, what do you do? You can't take ownership of that crash. What you take ownership
[00:56:03] of is your response to that, your response to your injuries. And that's to me is the most powerful
[00:56:08] thing that a person has because that gives you some level of control over circumstances that are
[00:56:14] truly beyond your control. Yep. I mean, I've said it from pretty much since June 23rd,
[00:56:21] to 2013, you know, the right actions follow the right perspectives. I mean, I could sit here
[00:56:25] and I could bitch about everything that I've lost. I could bitch about, you know, lost memory,
[00:56:31] a lost leg, a lost military career, a lost years of my life, you know, to the hospital and to
[00:56:34] recovery, where I can look at what I've gained. How does not happen? I wouldn't be sitting here with you.
[00:56:39] I wouldn't be doing the things that I'm doing. I wouldn't be living this very different purpose
[00:56:43] on a totally different platform than I was before. So I can take it with a grain of salt.
[00:56:48] Look at it as a blessing and a curse, one that I, my curse that I wouldn't wish on.
[00:56:51] Anyone, my own were said to me, and then, you know, I can just keep going about my day.
[00:56:57] It's just, it's that. At what point? So, so now, your two years in the hospital. So,
[00:57:03] 2014, you get out of the hospital and you start living. Is that when you get medically retired?
[00:57:09] Yeah. May 2014. May 2014, you get out. And what are you doing? You get out? What's your,
[00:57:16] what are you, what are you moving to? Are you living in San Diego at this time? Yeah.
[00:57:21] Living in OB. Oh yeah.
[00:57:26] No, so there is two, so I mean, I got it growing up again, that academic thing and that, that athletic thing.
[00:57:34] I didn't struggle with it. And now I find myself in this position, getting out of the ring
[00:57:38] core. I'm like, I'm not the same person that I knew physically and I'm definitely not the
[00:57:42] same person I knew mentally. But I really wanted to finish my first masters. And while I was still
[00:57:48] in, the doctors looked at me and they were like, there's no way that we're going to prove you
[00:57:51] for tuition assistance or any of that. Like, you're going to fail your classes. There's no way.
[00:57:54] Are you serious? Yeah. Well, so I went to my speech therapist and said, hey, can you download
[00:57:58] this program, read and write gold onto my computer? I'm going to figure this out. Like, I'm going
[00:58:02] to finish this last year. My masters ended up getting that masters in psychology with a sea average.
[00:58:08] So barely. But I was like determined to prove those doctors wrong. And every single one of
[00:58:14] them kept telling me, if you don't use it, you're going to lose it. Like, you have to continue
[00:58:17] training and rewiring your brain. So then I just, I didn't stop. I just kept going to school
[00:58:22] like the moment that I got out, I was just kept going. And obviously, I used this post in 11G.
[00:58:26] I built on the integrated back in up scholarship. So I did school like,
[00:58:31] wholeheartedly. So this is 2014. You get out of the hospital. You're like diving into
[00:58:35] school hardcore. You keep talking about going to speech therapy. And I've been listening
[00:58:40] really intently trying to figure out why you need speech therapy. And I found nothing so far.
[00:58:46] Super articulate, you know, nailing every word, pronouncing, pronouncing everything.
[00:58:51] Awesome. So what was like your lowest point for speech? Was it because the damage had been done to your
[00:58:58] jaw? Was it your brain damage? Or was it just both? And how bad was it? Was it a point where, you know,
[00:59:06] you weren't able to carry on a conversation? Yeah. So in the very beginning. Because that's
[00:59:10] face it right now. You're doing a damn good job. Thank you. No, so in the very beginning, it really
[00:59:15] was. It was getting my brain to fire to be able to express myself to again, to retrieve the
[00:59:20] words that I was actually looking for. Now it's more of like nerve and all of that, the trauma,
[00:59:26] like the physical trauma. Now it's like, I was trying not to point it out. But like, ours and
[00:59:30] S's, I'll try to avoid that. But yeah, you just said both of them perfectly. The sound.
[00:59:38] You make, but yeah, like actually when I was trying to say rewiring, just now, there's a lot of effort
[00:59:44] into that. But yeah. But so like the head trauma that was, that was one thing that I really
[00:59:50] focused on. And then around that time, I actually started competing in snowboarding.
[00:59:54] So you got your bad leg. Bad brain. You got your bad leg, bad brain. Good band, by the way.
[01:00:02] And you and you, or society's cool, like, like, we're going to start snowboarding.
[01:00:07] You're going to get your food from Florida. Yes. Yes. Okay. Where did that come from?
[01:00:13] Yeah. No, so there's an organization that came into my hospital room when I was actually
[01:00:18] still living at the hospital. I'm in still active duty. And they came in. They just said,
[01:00:23] how do you feel about learning a winter sport? And this was in the end of 2013. And I was just
[01:00:27] like, you know, anything. Just give me out of the hospital. Well, again, me being me. My doctors
[01:00:33] cleared me to Sitsky. But then when I showed up in Breck and I had Colorado, no one asked me
[01:00:37] for a medical clearance or anything. And I'm like, well, shit. So nobody looks cool.
[01:00:41] I'm going to try that one instead. And I ended up picking it up really quickly. And I loved it.
[01:00:47] And you know, it's just one of those things that reminds you of your independence and resiliency.
[01:00:50] And, you know, no one can do it for you. So I just kept with it. And what was it like on your bad leg?
[01:00:56] I mean, it was painful. I mean, and I had a, I have, I had like a little, this weird
[01:01:01] caviar, like carbon fiber contraption that basically took all of the weight off of my
[01:01:06] lower limb and put it all into my knee at the time. So I mean, I had a little bit of help. But I mean,
[01:01:11] it was, I mean, it was painful, but it was worth it. I mean, I mean, I wasn't stopping. I mean,
[01:01:15] I was still dealing with surgeries. I mean, gosh, I was having a surgery once every age of 12 weeks.
[01:01:23] And then having the recovery. And so I mean, I was sneak away from Balboa and go to Big Bear.
[01:01:27] And go see you have issues.
[01:01:29] The deal were most of the surgeries on your leg or were they on everything?
[01:01:35] Yeah, yeah, my leg. So between between my leg and my face, that's where the majority of them
[01:01:40] came from, but 44 now. They told you out of the gate that a bunch of your bones were going to die
[01:01:47] in your leg. And they were right. And, and at some point, like, um, you're, you're, are they
[01:01:58] giving you the protection like, hey, this isn't, this isn't going to last. Yep. I mean,
[01:02:02] toward the end of my efforts, if you will, um, I mean, they were coming in. They're like,
[01:02:07] this is a Christopher Columbus surgery at this point. Like, we're going to go in and we're going to
[01:02:10] try and do whether it was bone crafting or neuro decompression or whatever, what it was like,
[01:02:15] we don't even know we're going to find any more. Um, and finally I came to terms with it. And so
[01:02:19] do you know what you can have it? Um, was that before or after you did the walk in England? So my walk
[01:02:25] was my son to my leg. Okay. That was so, so you decided, I got this bad leg. I got brain damage.
[01:02:32] I got everything else going on, but I'm going to go walk a thousand miles. Yes.
[01:02:36] In the United Kingdom. How, how that come about? Um, and so actually there was a couple of
[01:02:45] older marines that was that were was working for an organization called Bob Wooder Foundation.
[01:02:49] And they heard about this event called Walking With The Glunded that, you know, they've done
[01:02:53] everything from the North Pole and the South Pole. And it was kind of just like this pilot idea.
[01:02:57] Um, and they were just looking for people stupid enough to walk a thousand miles and share enough
[01:03:01] one of them smee. Um, but knows that they came up and they were just like, hey, we're thinking
[01:03:06] about sponsoring this event. That's going to raise money for American and British soldiers that
[01:03:10] are dealing with specifically right injuries had trauma in, you know, invisible injuries of all
[01:03:16] sorts. And in the moment I was just like, you know what, the legs come in off anyways. I don't care
[01:03:20] if I trash it. Um, so let's do this thousand miles and then literally seven days after I got home,
[01:03:27] they got my leg off. The thousand miles that you walk, you were with at some point you were with
[01:03:32] Prince Harry. Yep. And he's a legit dude. He is a legit dude. I will give him that. I won't give
[01:03:39] many other couples. I mean, he, he, well, he's at least legit that he, you know, he, he served. I mean,
[01:03:45] he, he fought NAFTA and I stand on the feet. Was he in Iraq? I don't, I don't understand. But yeah,
[01:03:50] and there's some pretty cool stuff of him. There's a cool, there's a cool little video
[01:03:54] someone's interviewing him and then like the alarm sound to me runs off to go get some. Yep. And so
[01:03:59] that was cool. And you had some, some interaction with him? Yeah. Um, so my personal spin on that
[01:04:05] thousand miles. Like, of course, I was over there to raise awareness and fundraise. But I made 25
[01:04:10] memorial dog tags for Marine's who either never came home or they killed themselves and we got back home.
[01:04:15] And I carried each one for 40 miles to the poem and left them all across England's Gotland and
[01:04:19] Wales with the intention that a stranger would find them in honor of our fallen. You know, we, we
[01:04:24] we should blood together. We deserve to heal or, you know, men wounds together if you want. And he
[01:04:30] actually helped me lay a few of my dog tags. And then I left the final one with him at Buckingham
[01:04:37] Palace and then on what's their better and stay, he carried it to the Senate our for me. So again,
[01:04:42] he really has a great dude. His, his hearts in the right place for sure. And that was one of your
[01:04:47] friends TJ's at that the final dog tags. So actually that's pretty sad story actually. So there
[01:04:54] were two gentlemen that were in the hospital with me. They were blown up 10 days before I got hurt.
[01:05:00] So they were with one seven. And of course, you know, me being the 33 unit, we were doing constantly
[01:05:05] doing stuff with those guys, you know, insertions and extractions and stuff. And the two gentlemen
[01:05:10] that were with one seven, you know, we went through all of our coveries together and TJ was actually
[01:05:15] one of, um, was the guy that passed away when they lost their legs. Um, so I didn't, I never knew him.
[01:05:22] He was never really a friend. It was more so for them. And this, yeah, has, has wife.
[01:05:32] So then you get done with that walking a thousand miles and you come back to San Diego and
[01:05:40] pre-planned, you get back in your leg. Okay. This, this, my, my foot is gonna die and let's move forward.
[01:05:51] Let's get rid of it. There's a, um, like a video like mini documentary about you. It's done by
[01:06:02] my, my calls, my calls, and which is, um, some kind of a magazine. It's a weird fit for me, but yeah.
[01:06:08] Anyway, as I watch this video and man, um, there's, there's a video of you and you're walking
[01:06:15] on the beach and your barefoot walking on the beach. You're walking on ocean beach by the way.
[01:06:22] And there's the pier in the background and you're like saying, yeah, you know, I'm walking on the beach
[01:06:27] because I'm not going to be able to do this anymore. I'm not going to be able to feel the sand
[01:06:30] on my, on my foot anymore. That has gotta be the, the hardest decision that you've had to make it.
[01:06:41] I mean, for a person, right? Like you have at least this, like, I mean, I, the same, I mean,
[01:06:48] I surf and like I live by the beach. I love the ocean and walking barefoot on the sand is like
[01:06:55] totally a thing that is real. Like it's the best thing. And I'm sitting there thinking you'd
[01:07:02] been living in OB at the time and crazy that you're sitting there saying, yep, I'm going to,
[01:07:09] I'm going to walk on the sand for the last time right now. This is it. This is the last time I
[01:07:13] get to feel the sand between my toes. So the last time I get to wait around in this water.
[01:07:18] Yep. I was one of those things where it's like, the equality life. I was living a life that
[01:07:28] I, you know, I wasn't happy with as far as like living a life of constant recovery,
[01:07:32] pain, a lot of drugs. I mean, I'd be lying. If I told you, I was like,
[01:07:38] sober when I did the thousand mile walk. There was a lot of medication falls in that.
[01:07:41] But, you know, like, I just wanted those things. I was ready to close that chapter and just move
[01:07:46] forward. You know, there's, there's a lot of things that I wanted to do with my life or that I am doing.
[01:07:50] And still want to do with my life. And the thing is also important to note is they were going to,
[01:07:57] they're going to take your foot, your shin, leave your tib, fib, which I can't fully express this,
[01:08:05] but I do know from friends that have had above the knee and below the knee amputation. The
[01:08:11] difference between above the knee amputation and below the knee amputation is absolutely massive.
[01:08:18] The amount of articulation that you have in your knee is just it is incredible compared to
[01:08:24] when you lose your knee. Yeah. I mean, I'll never bitch about being an amputee. I'm thankful that
[01:08:31] I'm alive. But I would do anything to get my knee back. Well, the initial surgery, they do what they said
[01:08:42] they're going to do. They, whatever, made way up your calf or somewhere they leave, they leave enough knee.
[01:08:48] And this was right around, was this right around Thanksgiving? Yep. So right around Thanksgiving,
[01:08:53] you get this initial surgery. And for you, it's going to be liberating because you're not
[01:08:59] going to have to worry about this pain. You can get the feet that will work better than your foot.
[01:09:04] That's what it boils down to. I guess that's when I was talking about like all this stuff about
[01:09:06] the sand and getting all crazy with that. The bottom line is you were thinking, hey, that's great
[01:09:13] feeling, but I'm actually able to be better off with the different varieties of prosthetic feet and
[01:09:25] ankles and all the stuff that they can give you. I mean, there's many people that have deployed
[01:09:30] after they've gotten a below the knee surgery. I don't know how many people have above,
[01:09:35] but I'm sure there has been some, but it's a lot different. It's a lot different.
[01:09:41] So you get that surgery and it was, I guess it was a bad surgery. There was an infection.
[01:09:50] Is what happens? Yeah. I mean, again, one could see for another one, but yeah, that was definitely
[01:09:55] some malpractice on that one. But yeah, instead of using staples, they used stitches and I
[01:10:01] ever put a looped back on. There was a number of things. I was trying away from the emergency room
[01:10:05] three times. I'm going to tell them that it was fine. And then finally, you know, I mean, it was bad.
[01:10:11] I mean, it was really, really bad. And they finally, there was actually a doctor from scripts.
[01:10:19] That was like filling in for one of the doctors out in the ER at Pau Boa. And she saw my leg and
[01:10:23] she was like, oh, hell, no. Like, take every, but like, don't even put her in x-rays. Like,
[01:10:27] take everybody out of the OR. Like, I'm going in with her. And then it up, cutting out
[01:10:32] the room half of my knee. They left my patella. And then they went back in and they said that that
[01:10:37] was enough. And they took her on patella and made it in a bubb-n-e. So they
[01:10:41] gave a team cut my, my favorite. There's a note from you. December 20th, 2015, that I am awake
[01:10:56] and out of surgery for today. I lost a lot of muscle due to infection. Unless I have a Christmas
[01:11:01] miracle, they'll be taking my knee tomorrow. These are the times it's easy to give up.
[01:11:06] December 23rd, 2015 update. The infection almost killed me. It was eating the muscles in my leg.
[01:11:18] They saved my life plain and simple. I am an above the knee amputee, but I am healthier now. Still fighting
[01:11:26] the infection in more surgery. 10 a.m. which could make me a hip dysardic.
[01:11:32] Which could be worse, but nothing I can't beat. They're, they are trying their best.
[01:11:41] Said they've never seen anything so bad as to what was going on in my leg. I know I can beat this.
[01:11:46] I just hope they don't have to go too high on this limb.
[01:11:50] Menelian emotionally, this is the hardest thing I've ever dealt with.
[01:11:55] I am terrified.
[01:11:57] When they came in and said that they might take my hip, I didn't want them to wake me back up.
[01:12:08] They do not bring me out of that surgery room. Keep me asleep. You take, I mean,
[01:12:16] God love and could also anybody that's sitting in a bucket and has to live their life as a
[01:12:20] hip dysardic. That news was awful. I didn't think I was going to have the courage to keep going.
[01:12:33] I didn't want to keep going at that point.
[01:12:37] In the beginning of that, when you were reading and I was sitting, God, I was full shit.
[01:12:40] I'm just telling everybody that it's going to be okay.
[01:12:42] I'm glad that I at least finished that with I'm terrified because it's honest. It's true.
[01:12:51] December 24th, 2015. This is the next day. Christmas Eve. I am alive. I'm happy.
[01:13:02] I don't know anything about good news about my leg and it looks great. Being in above the
[01:13:05] knee amputee will be challenging at first and all I can say is bring it on. On another note, I am
[01:13:12] very sick and will be for quite some time. They found three bacterial infections, including Mersea.
[01:13:20] They also found blood caught in my arm. They put a pick line in. This is a light threatening
[01:13:25] matter, so I'll need to lay low for a while. Please keep praying. I got this. We got this.
[01:13:43] Craziness.
[01:13:47] Yep. Your parents were living here at this time? No. So you were who you with?
[01:13:52] I was living with my boyfriend at the time. My mom was living with us. She was around.
[01:14:02] It was the craziest thing. We all knew my life was just rotting. That's just what it was doing.
[01:14:11] My mom would go with me. You are. We would get turned away. My boyfriend at the time had gone
[01:14:16] back to Florida to drive with my little sister out because it was coming up on the holidays and stuff.
[01:14:22] When he was in Florida with her, you need to get your family here because we don't know if
[01:14:30] you're going to pull through this one. My dad's flying in from being on the pipeline. They're
[01:14:35] rushing driving across the country through the night to get back. It was bad.
[01:14:50] You eventually recovered from this. Good Lord. How long has it take to fight off these triple
[01:14:59] bacteria infections and whatnot? I ended up getting out of the hospital. It would have been very late
[01:15:06] January, early February. I was there for at least another month, five six weeks. During that five
[01:15:12] six weeks, is that when you started doing rehab to get fitted for a prosthetic, did that happen that
[01:15:17] fast? So they actually sort of fitting me when my staples came out. So yeah, so would have been
[01:15:25] probably the week before I got out of the hospital. Then I hit the ground run with that.
[01:15:29] Which is no big surprise at this point. I don't want my leg and I want to get the freak out of here.
[01:15:34] So. Then what happens then? So now what was that rehab process? You're trying to learn to walk
[01:15:40] again and all this stuff? Yeah. So your supposed to go to physical therapy and go to gate training
[01:15:45] and sit through six weeks, birth of training on this like, learning how to walk. They let
[01:15:52] me go after two weeks. So I took my leg on after two weeks and just like, I mean, this is,
[01:15:58] this is it. And I'm going to actually have these videos of my mom watching me for walk for the first
[01:16:03] time and of course it was very emotional and whatnot, but it was like it didn't skip a beat.
[01:16:08] He gave me two weeks and I was going to figure it out. And then where'd you go when you got
[01:16:13] release from the hospital? Did you stay in San Diego? Yeah, I stayed in San Diego for quite some time.
[01:16:16] Then I ended up going up to Temecula for a little while and then bouncing back and forth,
[01:16:23] got back on my snowboard and so I was spending the winters in Colorado and going back
[01:16:28] your in California. What is it like snowboarding? No. Oh, it is weird. No, it's, I don't know.
[01:16:35] I mean, I don't know any, like, I can't remember what it's like anymore to like snowboard with
[01:16:39] two legs or a busted up leg. I don't know. I mean, it's again, like I just got back on a board
[01:16:46] and just rode. I mean, of course I wiped down. I hurt quite a bit. But yeah, I've got some, you know,
[01:16:54] again, just didn't skip a beat. And at this point, like, okay, so that cosmopolitan video was made
[01:17:02] around this time, right? So you're starting to get some kind of notoriety. Is that the right word?
[01:17:08] Wait, is notoriety bad? No, I don't know. I don't know. You seem like the type of person that
[01:17:13] wouldn't want to be called famous, but you're starting to get some some recognition. Right?
[01:17:18] People are starting to sort of hear what you've gone through and start to be interested in the story.
[01:17:24] Right? So this is all happening to at this time, which is weird. It was very, very weird.
[01:17:30] I mean, I'm not like, when I think of any of the things that I've done at this point,
[01:17:33] it's like, you don't want to be celebrated. You don't want the attention for doing what you
[01:17:36] want to do and living your life. How you want to live it. Like, I wasn't doing anything
[01:17:40] miraculous. I'm just like, I want to live. I want to move forward with my life. I want to be here
[01:17:43] for my family. And then even now, it's, I just like helping people. I'm like, you know, I mean,
[01:17:49] so yeah. So you get the cosmopolitan thing. You're, you go and you, you go and do a job as a
[01:17:57] stunt woman in a movie. What's that all about? I just, Philan Voids, you know,
[01:18:04] adrenaline seeking, I guess, trying to fill that. What is Jesus' stunt woman?
[01:18:07] Um, so everything from Gaurc crashes to explosions, to pyro. Did anyone notify you that
[01:18:13] this makes you are your head? There was a couple times. But yeah, no, you're like, I'll
[01:18:20] crank up the speech therapy and just do more stunts. That's it. Yeah. All my guns on.
[01:18:26] Heck, what did you, uh, what you were in a movie with Mark Wahlberg? Is that right? Yeah.
[01:18:32] That's the biggest one. It's a Patriots day. And what do you do in that movie? Get the one up.
[01:18:36] You're like, I got experience at this. Yeah. Check this out. Yeah. Like, get blown up. Get
[01:18:41] carried around on stretchers. Luzilim, followed by wheelchair at one's at one point.
[01:18:46] Bunch of different scenes. Yeah. Um, okay. So, so you got that going on. You got the, the
[01:18:52] people magazine body image hero, which is what, what does that mean? Well, when I was
[01:19:00] in this whole process, I mean, even from the get go with the face, like the interest in my face,
[01:19:04] um, you know, I didn't, and the doctor saw me all the stuff about my leg. I didn't really
[01:19:09] care if I was going to be able to get up and run again, or any of that, like, as a young woman, you know,
[01:19:13] all I cared about was who's looking at me differently? Can I wear heels? Can I wear a dress? Is anybody
[01:19:17] going to find me attractive enough to have a family one day? Like, really worried about the self-esteem
[01:19:22] stuff. Um, and so like, moving forward, I just decided that I was going to own my differences,
[01:19:28] that I was going to like be proud of the scars that I wore because they told my stories. They think,
[01:19:32] I mean, in my opinion, they make me look pretty tough too, but um, but no, like, I wanted to show
[01:19:37] people that it was okay to me. It's street cred. Exactly. Yeah. But that's like, I just wanted
[01:19:44] to show people that it was okay, you know, like, you don't have to be the cookie cutter, you know,
[01:19:48] definition of what beautiful is. And I don't want to say the cheesy, like, you know, beauty comes
[01:19:53] from within, but I like, I wanted to show people that it was, I mean, it was beautiful to be strong.
[01:19:57] It was, you know, it was beautiful to have drive and have well and to, to not fail. I mean,
[01:20:02] to give it a all. And so that that's, that's what the people magazine, things of what they
[01:20:09] interview you and take a bunch of pictures of you and all that. And now, again, I'm just, I'm just
[01:20:15] kind of have to trace the fact that people are starting to follow you and and recognize that you're
[01:20:21] a, um, that you have a very interesting story and inspiring story. Yeah. As these things are happening,
[01:20:27] because the reason I kind of have to say that is because then you like do other things at the same
[01:20:33] time, like getting stunt women and getting crashed and blown up and stuff like that. And at some
[01:20:38] point, you got your master's degree in business administration, right? And this is still just
[01:20:42] approved to people that you can still mentally go. Yes. And yes. But on the other, I think the other
[01:20:50] side is that to like, even right now when I do eventually finish this doctor, like I'm terrified
[01:20:56] of what I'm going to do with that time. I'm like, oh my god, I love structure. I'm so, you
[01:21:00] mumbled filling the void. The other is like a couple minutes ago, you're like, I'm filling the
[01:21:04] void. So what you're saying is you have to be busy. You have to have something to focus on,
[01:21:10] something to do exactly. Okay. That starts to explain some things. Yes. Because at some point,
[01:21:16] you decided that you were going to put another thing on your list of things to get done,
[01:21:21] and it's climb the seven summits. Right. So the highest peak on either the seven continents.
[01:21:30] It was one of the things that hasn't been done by a female above the knee amputee, I can't speak
[01:21:35] for the men. But yeah, I decided that I needed something. You know, I lost the 2016 snowboarding season
[01:21:41] due to the last revision surgery to my amputated side. And so I was like, well, I can't do any
[01:21:47] high impact sport. So what else can I do in the mountains? And you might want to check with
[01:21:54] you, you're like, this is the thing mountain here, not a high impact sport. Okay. We went up
[01:22:00] the set up a little coaching situation here. Because I'm not sure. So check it out. So the idea,
[01:22:07] you get the idea, you must just say, okay, what kind of do that's super, super hard? Yeah.
[01:22:12] You start with Kilimanjaro, is that the first one? Yep. And how that go?
[01:22:17] It was amazing. Actually, it was insane. Because we were up and down in four and a half days,
[01:22:21] which Kilimanjaro stands 19,000, 241 feet. So for me to make my way up and make it my way back down,
[01:22:28] that quickly was without a control. But it was one of those things where it was, I mean,
[01:22:35] in a sick way, like, just like I was addicted to school, I sort of get addicted to that suffering,
[01:22:40] because like you suffer in your miserable, for days on end. But then once you make it to your goal,
[01:22:44] it's that much sweeter. And so, I mean, it was just, I don't know, like a weird hunger from more
[01:22:50] that I wasn't really like finding any worlds. And then, I mean, I mean, we ended up raising like
[01:22:55] $150,000 for clean water for the East Tanzanians with that climb. So now it's like, I have the personal
[01:23:02] side of things. And then I have this other purpose that I was already, you know, felt like I was missing
[01:23:06] by not having any Marine Corps. And then from there, that's when I everything took. So which one came
[01:23:10] next? Carstens. And carstens. I was looking at that one. This is in Indonesia. How tall is it?
[01:23:18] Just over 16,000 feet. And it looked to me like the getting there was half the battle. Yeah. So,
[01:23:25] honestly, I mean, carstens is an interesting mountain, because it's notorious for being the most
[01:23:29] hostile and technical invertant, really versatile. But I mean, it's a 72 mile trek into the base of
[01:23:36] this rock face. So yeah, it's just, I mean, it's honestly low impact. Right back, it's a low impact scenario.
[01:23:42] It's 72 miles. Yeah. But I mean, even just getting out there. And I mean, the people that you
[01:23:49] encounter, the Donnie and the Money tribes, like, I mean, that was just an experience in itself.
[01:23:53] I mean, the local indigenous tribes came through and like ransacked and destroyed all over
[01:23:59] camps and stole our passports while we're like, up, 15,000 feet watching them. Did they teach you
[01:24:04] them? Yeah, that's very awesome stuff. You got to leave me a little couple of people back.
[01:24:09] That's a curdy on that stuff. Yeah. So it's 72 mile hike in. Yeah. Now, some of my friends that are
[01:24:16] amputees, it's not like your your prosthetic just is this clean, easy fit and it's all good to go.
[01:24:25] That thing, that thing gets all kinds of issues. I was thinking about, I sweat a lot. If I was
[01:24:31] wearing the prosthetic, you have, they would have to put drain holes on the bottom of it. Do they have
[01:24:36] drain holes? Nope. But they see them. I would feel that thing up with sweat.
[01:24:41] But we'll go back. I'll send you a link later to my Everest, like mini documentary and I'm
[01:24:45] going to tank top when everybody else is in like these big, poppy summits. It's I run so hot and
[01:24:50] I'll let I miss you my leg and so I fill your paint on that. So you're doing these lawn. You do
[01:24:55] that and you make it to the to the top of car stands, right? Yeah. You launch at some point,
[01:25:02] I guess you wanted to put your business administrative degree to work. So you launched a T-shirt
[01:25:07] company called Headcase. What inspired that? It will. So I'm an avid hunter. I believe in
[01:25:16] the things that I consume. They need to die at my hands. I don't like eating things that are
[01:25:21] bred to die. So it was really involved in the outward industry as far as mountain hunting and
[01:25:26] the likes of that nature. And if you walked into my house now, it is full of taxidermy specifically
[01:25:31] schools. And so there you have it. So a lot of it was joining forces with my buddy Nevada who
[01:25:37] carved schools for living now and using his artwork and in schools, you know, the head case and
[01:25:42] the outdoors. When you, at what point did you, did you grow up as a hunter? I mean, we did little
[01:25:48] stuff, you know, white tail and hogs and stuff like that growing up, but none of the stuff that I'm
[01:25:53] doing now. And when did that start? In this whole freaking crazy scenario you've got on folding.
[01:26:00] You know, I, so we were talking about like loss and gain earlier. And again, my biggest
[01:26:05] perspective, like biggest gain has been my perspective on life. And so I started to appreciate,
[01:26:09] started to appreciate just the cycle. And so that's when I really started to look into,
[01:26:15] okay, well, what's going on in the outdoors? What am I actually putting into my body, A,
[01:26:18] and then also just, you know, conservation efforts. And, and then, yeah, I'm being able to
[01:26:24] provide for my family, like in the most natural way possible. And yeah, I mean, hunting is not about death.
[01:26:31] It's about living. What, what, you, when did you go on your first hunt?
[01:26:35] Oh, man, growing up? No, no, like you're, you're more recent hunting career.
[01:26:41] Probably, 2013. Okay. So you got right right into it. 2014 somewhere there, yeah.
[01:26:46] And by the way, anyone doesn't know hunting is not easy. And you, I mean, involves,
[01:26:54] it involves, that's why when you're talking about 72 mile hike in, I mean, hunting takes a lot of,
[01:27:00] look, I just went on a hunt. And I think we were averaging, like, I think we average, like 10, 10,
[01:27:07] or 12 miles a day. It's like, eight to 12 miles a day. You know, you're putting out up and down,
[01:27:12] hills and it's, it's hard work. And I'm doing, I'm out there doing it with two legs,
[01:27:17] by the way. So, okay. So, you start your t-shirt thing. And then you go for your first little,
[01:27:25] kind of, uh, little, what would you call it? Little recon, a little recon of Everest,
[01:27:31] to base camp. Yes. That was just, let's get a look at this thing. Let's see what's up.
[01:27:37] Yeah, I mean, how inspiring was that? We like, oh, exactly like that actually.
[01:27:43] Right. I could imagine that would be, if you have that in your mind and you get there in your
[01:27:47] thaw bottom, you're like, let's do this. Yes. And I was losing it. I mean, obviously, just very
[01:27:53] emotional together. But, you know, there's several, like, there's Hoot and Holleron and several
[01:27:58] of bombs and tears and, you know, everything. But no, I mean, the moment, like, three days into the
[01:28:03] actual, like, base camp track, I saw Everest for the first time and I just knew, like,
[01:28:08] that's it. I'm going to do it. And so, so that was just getting, getting a feel for it,
[01:28:14] yeah. Getting to know people, getting to kind of see how the system would run, who'd you go,
[01:28:18] like, what brought, how'd you get on that trip? Um, so actually, you're not like walking down
[01:28:22] to the, the travel, what are those people called? Travel agent. Travel agent. Travel agent.
[01:28:27] Yeah, book me to base camp one way. So, actually, this check by the name of a haily web that I met
[01:28:33] on my thousand mile walk. Um, she's, she was the local mountain guide over there and she hit me
[01:28:38] up out of nowhere. I'm just like, hey, I'm going to, you know, guide a base camp track to Everest.
[01:28:43] You want to come and I'm like, well, actually, yes. Because I needed to decide if I'm going to
[01:28:47] climb from the north side or the south side, you know, down the road. And so, yeah, I mean,
[01:28:52] I went down there in absolutely fell in love with Nepal and the people and just their way of life
[01:28:56] in their culture. Okay. So, you get done with that. At some point, you open a hair salon? Yes.
[01:29:02] I hear an ocean side for a little ways up in a ocean side. Right on, is that so old there?
[01:29:07] Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's during really well. Um, well, so, so a little backstory to all of these
[01:29:11] random little things that I'm doing. Yeah, because you are doing some random stuff at this point.
[01:29:14] And I want me to look, it can be a really fresh man here. No, so when I woke up in the hospital in
[01:29:19] 2015, I looked around the room and told myself that whoever was in that hospital room with me,
[01:29:24] that they would never work for anybody else over again. That, like, if they were willing to
[01:29:27] sacrifice their time, you know, their personal lives remain to make sure that I was okay. That,
[01:29:32] you know, I was going to help them live out their dreams, they help keep me alive. So,
[01:29:37] my best friend Christine is actually my business partner in that. So, she's the head
[01:29:42] haunched down there. I'm just the CFO slash investor. So, if we're, if we're an O side, that's it.
[01:29:48] And we need a haircut. Where do we go? Chapter one here and body lab. Chapter one here and body.
[01:29:54] Do you give high entice there? No, they won't do it. Dang it. What about all the
[01:29:58] you see earlier you said like, was it three five you said I hope three five is listening to this?
[01:30:02] Two five. You said I hope two five and in my mind two five is listening to this. Once there are so many
[01:30:08] Marines listening to this right now that if you don't get a pair of clippers at at at the place up an
[01:30:15] O side, you know, let's make it happen. Okay, so you get that going on and then February,
[01:30:23] you start you go back to climbing. So, November was you went to Everspace Camp Trek.
[01:30:29] You do the hair salon thing February, you go to, I could go to a go to a taxi. You go to
[01:30:36] Ecuador for a colto taxi. And this is a summit attempt. Right. But you didn't make it.
[01:30:44] Nope. Well, yeah, turn around at like 18,500. And what is it? How much further did you have to go?
[01:30:51] Oh, another 1500 vertical? What was it? Just altitude and moving slow. My climbing partner had a headache.
[01:31:02] We were about to hit this like really long traverse section and like with my prosthetic if the
[01:31:07] high side is on my left side or my prosthetic side, I cannot move well. So with her being light,
[01:31:13] had I had having a headache and me already being a little unsighty in the feed just was,
[01:31:17] didn't make sense. Yeah, to make a smart call. Yep. And you kind of talked about that in some of
[01:31:21] your blogs just about like making a good decision, which the mountains are littered with bodies of people
[01:31:28] that get summit fever and they're going to go for it and they don't make it. Exactly. And that's
[01:31:34] one of those things where it's like if someone's climbing with me and something happened,
[01:31:37] like I wouldn't be able to live with myself. So yeah, I mean the mountains are not going anywhere.
[01:31:42] And if that one does, it's going to be another one. So. So you get done with that one.
[01:31:47] Some lessons learned and then you go to, you then you go to try Denali. Yeah, Denali is a mean,
[01:31:53] main mountain. Yeah, so go out to Denali and spend literally a month, the whole entire month of
[01:32:01] June 2018 on Denali and we made it up to 14,000 feet, we're pinned for 17 days. Now going up,
[01:32:09] now going down. We were scalping food and fuel from people as they were like making their way
[01:32:13] down. We were trying to be stubborn and right out this terrible terrible. I mean, what would really be
[01:32:17] a 717 days and like you would sleep for 90 minutes and you get out of your tent for 90 minutes
[01:32:23] and dig your tent out. I think I could sleep. That's like you can do for 17 days. 17 days.
[01:32:30] Do you, do you, do you, does your body a try so bad in 17 days? Like I think about like,
[01:32:37] I work out all the time, but occasionally, okay, so here's an example. We just had an event called
[01:32:42] the mustard in Denvercala, Rodo. If I would have known you, you would have been there for
[01:32:48] another one of what have been awesome. So like during that week, it's kind of hard to do my normal
[01:32:52] workout routine. It's a little bit lighter than normal. And then from that, I came home for one day.
[01:32:57] I got one workout and then I went hunting in Utah and I didn't work out there other than
[01:33:02] humping up and out. But I can imagine if all you're doing is sitting in a tent and then getting
[01:33:06] out every 90 minutes and digging out. And then if you think at the end of that, you're going to have
[01:33:10] to go and walk up that freaking mountain. Yeah, that seems like a, yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah,
[01:33:18] I mean, your body just attributes anyways. But of course, being an altitude, like you're just
[01:33:22] withering away as it is. And up there, limited food, limited supplies. Like you're not going to
[01:33:27] sit there and just be shoveling all sorts of stuff in your face. So, but it was hard. And then out there
[01:33:31] in Denon, like you can't just go for a hike or any of that. Like there are so many crevasses
[01:33:36] that everything that you have to do, you have to have your technical gear be on a rope.
[01:33:40] So, I mean, you were literally confined to your tent and to very, very small, like little
[01:33:44] living space. What was the avalanche threat? Well, luckily, we were far enough for many slabs.
[01:33:50] I mean, we're really just kind of hanging out there. At that point, you're just worried about
[01:33:53] being very alive because you slept too long. Okay, knowing, I don't know you well, but at least
[01:33:57] sitting through this podcast and realizing that you need to be doing something at all times.
[01:34:01] What, what the hell was your mindset after day 12? I was terrible. I honestly,
[01:34:07] any claim, like the hardest part of my tent time, like I could not sit still. And so yeah,
[01:34:12] I mean, you bring anything with you, bring a book to you, whatever. Yes, and no. So, on Denon,
[01:34:17] it's illegal to have any sharpness or any help because it's part of the National Park Service. So,
[01:34:21] I mean, you have to drag a 50 pounds lead and carry a 50 pounds lead. So, you're interested.
[01:34:26] I hear that. So, yeah, I mean, we both neglect at one point. That.
[01:34:33] Okay, so then you get eventually you get weathered off that climb.
[01:34:36] Yeah, well, so we had a very short weather window. We ended up making it up to again,
[01:34:40] 18,200, 300. Same climbing partner that I was actually on Kodapaxi with. I was moving a little
[01:34:48] bit slow. This section called the Autobahn. And, you know, the weather was rolling on quick.
[01:34:53] She wasn't feeling too hot. Just, you know, just wasn't going to happen then. So, I made the
[01:34:58] cold to turn around and come down. So, you, so now the next thing that you're looking at is the
[01:35:04] opportunity to do Everest again. That's where you were up. So, you come down from Denali and now
[01:35:09] it's now it's Everest, go time. Yes, and now so I did Elbrist, the highest point in Europe over in
[01:35:14] Russia. Okay. So, I did Denali in June 2018 or it's time to get in June 2018. Elbrist,
[01:35:20] the highest point in Europe in September 2018. And then I went down to South America and Argentina.
[01:35:26] January 2019, crushed that one. So, then I decided I was ready for Everest.
[01:35:32] Okay. Now, you decide you're ready for Everest. Is there still, is that because you've been
[01:35:38] hiking in the mountains so much you've been doing so much that you're feeling like you're conditioning
[01:35:40] is good or is it like, is it like when you fight in MMA or you run a triathlon where when you get
[01:35:47] done you okay at a recover a little bit? Yeah, I mean, it is, but like for me especially, I mean,
[01:35:52] for any mountaineer, it's like building box. Like, each of these mountains, A Humbles you, but then
[01:35:57] teaches you something different. So, whether you know, you know, Kilimanjaro for example was my
[01:36:02] first full exposure to endurance. So to speak, you know, especially the altitude,
[01:36:06] Cursed ends with super technical. So that's a totally different skill set. Denali, winter,
[01:36:10] camping, glacier, travel, Elbrist, patients for myself and people, hacking, Kaguah,
[01:36:15] it's the highest mountain outside of the hill. Kind of rushed over that one pretty quick.
[01:36:18] Yeah, what Elbrist? No, patients for people. People? Oh, yeah.
[01:36:22] Yeah, that's yeah. Working on this home. And then yeah, Ack and Kaguah is known as the mountain of
[01:36:29] death. It's the highest mountain outside of the Himalayas and down in Argentina and that one really taught
[01:36:35] me just how my body is going to react to that kind of altitude to big mountains. Then how did it react?
[01:36:41] Totally fine. It's weird. So I run super hot, because of losing the leg. And then I don't
[01:36:49] right now, knock on wood. I don't really suffer from any like altitude side effects. I can
[01:36:53] don't have the headaches. I don't have a hard time breathing. So once I confirmed that, I was like,
[01:36:58] all right, let's go. The only issue that really ever kind of comes up is my residual limb
[01:37:04] swells inside of the carbon fiber socket. So that can be kind of risky.
[01:37:10] And that can be risky because you won't be able to get it off. Got cut off circulation.
[01:37:15] Okay, so you cut off circulation. And then you then you have a real problem. Yes.
[01:37:21] Okay, well, did you have to do any more prep? So when you when you're not looking at Everest,
[01:37:27] you're doing your feeling like you're in pretty good shape for it physically.
[01:37:32] And then it's okay, let's get all my gear together, which now you know pretty well,
[01:37:36] because you've done these other climbs. Your feeling like your gear list is pretty straightforward.
[01:37:40] Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about Everest. So you get to, you get there, you get to
[01:37:48] base camp. What's that like? How freaking pumped are you at this point? I was jazzed. I mean,
[01:37:54] more than it was crazy too, just because I mean, obviously, you know, I've been out there already.
[01:37:59] So I mean, all of these memories are coming back up. And I mean, you're just in total all
[01:38:04] walking out in the Himalayas. Like, you do not matter. Nothing about you matters out there. So
[01:38:09] like, I mean, it's a it's a world when you when you're first cruising in to Everest Base Camp
[01:38:14] and just into the Kumbu region of Nepal. But like making it into base camp, it was interesting
[01:38:19] because there were so many people like waiting for me there. Like so many people either they saw me
[01:38:24] on the base camp track. They've been watching my career, whatever. Like they were just so stoked
[01:38:28] to have me there. And that just meant so much to me because it was like, you know what,
[01:38:32] I knew this was big. In my mind, this is big, but not as big as like whatever,
[01:38:37] but yeah, things that as I guess, and like it made me realize that I was impacting a lot more
[01:38:41] people. And then of course there was like the nasaer and from, you know, from time to time that
[01:38:46] tell me, oh, you're not going to make it above camp 2 as in above the NPPTA. And of course,
[01:38:50] that just feels my fire. But no, I mean, base camp special place, just because it's like this
[01:38:56] huge, obviously, tent city, but there are people from all over the world with the same
[01:39:01] coin goal of getting to the highest point in the world. How long how many days were you at base camp
[01:39:07] for? Um, geez. So what have been in two or three weeks? So it's like two or three weeks at base camp.
[01:39:15] And then, do you do those little excursions where you go up for a little bit and come back down?
[01:39:19] Yeah. Yeah. Well, so there's the kumbu ice fall, which is realistically probably the most
[01:39:26] dangerous part of Everest, at least as far as climbing goes. And it's just because the ground's
[01:39:31] constantly shifting. Obviously, I mean, the name tells you all like ice falls, there's avalanches.
[01:39:37] It's just crazy. And so we would go up there and we'd like test my prosthetics and the ladders.
[01:39:41] We'd, you know, obviously go across, you know, move along the fixed lines. We'd went up to camp 1 and
[01:39:47] we, you know, came all the way back down. And after doing that, I actually made the decision that I
[01:39:54] wasn't going to come below camp 1 again. So climb high and slip low a couple of times and then finally
[01:40:04] my team left me at camp 1 and everybody else went back down. And I see it, I see it at camp 1 for
[01:40:09] above 20,000 feet for almost four weeks. And your decision to do that was just to get better
[01:40:16] acclimated or to avoid the kumbu ice fall or you just, because I can't move fast through that stuff.
[01:40:20] And then not, yeah, I just, I knew that going up and down through that, like that's just another
[01:40:25] variable and more risk. I know for a fact that I can withstand 20,000 feet. So it was really just kind of,
[01:40:32] you know, weighing the pros and cons of both. And in my opinion, like again, if something happened to me,
[01:40:37] when I'm sitting in the middle of this valley at 20,000 feet, then it's just me. I mean, I was out there by myself
[01:40:42] in a tent. And there's no one. But if I was in the kumbu and there's my team and then another 20
[01:40:49] people who are also like doing the same thing and in something happens and I don't know, that's just a huge
[01:40:55] cross-to-bear. So I'd rather be solo and something happened than go back to the kumbu.
[01:41:00] How many people are on your team? So we had two locals. My buddy's Robin Chris and then a couple of
[01:41:07] archie's me two Americans, Robin Chris, then two locals. That's the team right there. Who are Robin
[01:41:13] Chris? So Chris is actually, I do that's climbed with me a few times. He'd actually did Albrist
[01:41:18] in Akhenko with me and then Rob, and he's a stud. He was my cinematographer for Ferdinalli. And then
[01:41:26] I decided that he's just, I mean, he's a mountain goat. So I was like, you know, I want you to be a part
[01:41:31] of my team, obviously, because you can handle things when it hits the fan. But also, like, you're
[01:41:36] going to film this far. So at what point, so you get to camp two, you spend four weeks or no,
[01:41:44] it's a camp one you spent four weeks at. I just spent four weeks above 20,000 feet. Okay,
[01:41:49] got it. And then at what point is the decision point? Like, okay, it's our go time.
[01:41:54] So it would have been, we get word, I mean, it's all a weather game out there. So we get word that
[01:42:01] there's a really nice weather window. And it's long, there's not a cloud in the sky, the wind's
[01:42:05] perfect. And then we get word that about 250 of the 330 climbers are going to be trying for
[01:42:13] that same weather window. And I just went back and I thought about things. And my biggest fear
[01:42:20] on what I'm climbing isn't dying. You know, my biggest fear is getting frostbite and losing more of
[01:42:27] my, you know, already very short limb. So I sat there and I reflected and said, you know what,
[01:42:33] I can't get stuck in that line. A, because like what happens if my client partners run out of oxygen,
[01:42:38] there are no options, there's no going up or down. Like, I run the risk of losing, you know,
[01:42:42] somebody that I care deeply about. Obviously, there's the risk of frostbite. I run warm. I have
[01:42:48] an elevated heart rate because of my injuries. So I'm using more oxygen. Like, there was just
[01:42:53] too much. There was too much to like deal with other people. And not only that, but what happens if
[01:42:57] I get stuck behind somebody too. In my world, like, if you're on my team and we're climbing
[01:43:02] together, like, you go at my pace. And some days I haul ass. Some days I'm moving a little bit slower
[01:43:06] because of my leg. So me and the team decided that we were going to do is called threading the
[01:43:12] needle and go for a much shorter weather window. And we didn't even know if the ropes are going
[01:43:19] to be fixed to the top. Right. So this is prior to this big window. You guys said, well, there's a
[01:43:23] shorter window that's going to last however many days and we're going to go for it then. Yep.
[01:43:27] We decided that we're going to go. We were one of the first teams did push. So. And then, and then
[01:43:37] so you go up from camp two to camp three and then you stay camp three. How long do you say
[01:43:41] there for? Just tonight. And then camp three to camp four another night. Yep. And then you sleep for
[01:43:46] like three hours. I can't for and then you push the summit. So it goes camp four camp five. You just
[01:43:53] there's no camp five. There's no camp six. So you went from straight from camp four
[01:44:01] to and you guys made it to Hillary step. Yep. So so we made it as a so sound. We made it to
[01:44:09] 200 meters away from the summit. Okay. I should be really freaking proud actually. Like I should
[01:44:16] say that a little more enthusiastically. But yeah, no, I mean we made it to the south summit. So I'm
[01:44:22] obviously super proud of that. But yeah, it was a little disheartening to see it. I could throw a rock
[01:44:27] at it. And that's um yeah, I mean when you look at those pictures when you see and Hillary step
[01:44:33] has changed I think in 2015 it changed from like this big kind of a like a 10 meter like 12 meter
[01:44:42] something rock. And now it's like a little bit. It looks like something happened to it. Yeah.
[01:44:47] Earth greater something. And so but that's where you guys made it to. And once again, you faced with
[01:44:54] this tough decision to make of like, do we press and go? And it's a huge risk. I had a friend
[01:45:01] that tried to climb Everest and he was a total stud. And he was like, I mean a total stud. And
[01:45:10] he was like, yeah, you know, every step is a freaking nightmare. Like it is so hard. It's like you
[01:45:19] can't describe how hard it is. Because people think, hey, you were 200 meters. Come on. Yeah,
[01:45:26] you got right. Yeah. No, I mean when it was bizarre too. So actually like at the moment when we were
[01:45:32] going to turn around or we did turn around, I was above everybody by I don't know 20 yards maybe.
[01:45:41] And so the local Sherpa actually made his way up to me at the anchor and said,
[01:45:46] they're out of oxygen. You and I can keep going up to the summit.
[01:45:50] Um, you know, are we can turn around? And so I'm like, I'm looking at them.
[01:45:57] Our entire like summit push was rough. I mean, it was in just total insanity. And I just remember
[01:46:03] looking at them and both of the thing having this look of just exhaustion and just fear.
[01:46:09] I'm like, no, I'm not doing this. Okay. There's that doesn't mean that much to me, you know.
[01:46:13] Would they have sat there and waited for you to come back because they don't have a sharper
[01:46:16] or they just turn around and go. They would just turn around and go, but that's even, I mean, that's even more
[01:46:20] dangerous too. Yeah. Because then I have no oxygen. I have, you don't even know how it gets out.
[01:46:23] It's like, versus yeah. I guess is a bad situation. And so I'm not only that, but like, why would I only go up with one
[01:46:29] shirt, but that I don't really even know. You know, so it's like, I was just in the end. And it was so
[01:46:34] strange too. I think I think about the summertime because if you would have seen my reaction to turn around on
[01:46:38] Denali, I was pissed. Like I practically shoved this camera back in Rob's face. I'm like,
[01:46:43] angry that, you know, that it's all fallen apart. And then that's after 17 days is sitting
[01:46:48] very rare. I'm starving. But then I mean this time, like I just looked down at Rob and was like,
[01:46:56] no, I was at total peace with this situation. I mean, took you wrong. I could have loved to
[01:47:01] sum it, but I just, and I also wouldn't have felt right. Like, I mean, I have been through so much
[01:47:05] with those two dudes for two months at this point, on Everest. Like, yeah, later. Yes, yeah, I'm not
[01:47:10] like a summit now. I mean, I just couldn't do it. Um, yeah. Then, and coming down is not it. It's not like
[01:47:18] once you turn around. Okay. Now we're good. Oh, no. Once you turn around, it's still a nightmare. That's where
[01:47:25] everyone dies is on the way down because they, they, like you said earlier, they get summit fever and they
[01:47:29] exhaust everything that they have to get up to the top. And they just lay down and go to sleep on the
[01:47:33] on the way down. They're done. Um, and it was, I mean, especially for me, like with the prosthetic,
[01:47:38] they're going up. I have a technique. I mean, it just tons of right leg lunges and tricep dips
[01:47:43] and, I mean, it's intense, but on the way down, there's no technique. It's just forward and
[01:47:48] meant to them. Like, the best thing that I can do for myself is know how to fall down. Um,
[01:47:53] so yeah, I mean, because you fall a lot when you're coming down. I mean, I better know how to fall.
[01:47:58] This is a little bit of a day's off when you're coming down.
[01:48:02] That leaves a better not a catch myself. Do you, do you change legs for coming down? No, I don't.
[01:48:07] And is that because it's impractical? Is that because it doesn't make any difference?
[01:48:11] There's a making a difference. No. Yeah. I mean, so they actually, the only thing out there right now
[01:48:15] for people like me are the, for us to be able to climb the way that I'm climbing is the feet that
[01:48:21] I make, I make them myself. So there's not many options to change of anyways.
[01:48:29] Okay. And you get down your at peace with a decision. How long did the weather hold for?
[01:48:34] Oh, quite some time actually for days. Okay. I mean, which was of course, I mean, that's
[01:48:41] sad for me because I'm sitting here watching these people go up, but I mean, your bodies are so
[01:48:45] trash after being at, you know, 26, 27, 28,000 feet for so long. Like, and if you're out of oxygen,
[01:48:51] you're out of oxygen, like, at that point, you're pretty much tapped. Um, and so I mean, even after
[01:48:57] we made it back down to base camp, I mean, coming down like through camp 3 and 2, like, I was
[01:49:03] so at peace with everything because I'm watching these zoos of people come up. Yeah. I mean,
[01:49:08] hundreds of people, and in that moment I was like, you know what, you did the right thing. You're not
[01:49:12] one of the ants. You're not one of the minions. Like, you were savior smart. I mean,
[01:49:15] I'd be wrong, like, when I got back down to base camp, but definitely, I was like, do you have
[01:49:19] any to do another attempt? Like, what's up? But I mean, just the weather wasn't going to hold
[01:49:23] that anyways. So yeah, the, he image is coming back from the Everest this year of the lines of
[01:49:30] people has been crazy to say. Yeah. Literally, the entire like ridge to the summit is one way
[01:49:38] traffic jam. Yeah. And to me, that's not what Mal and Irina is, you know, like, in my opinion,
[01:49:42] like that totally discredits, but what all it should be, um, you know, I'm glad that I was out there
[01:49:49] with me and my thoughts and literally two other people. Okay, four kind of a trip up. But yeah,
[01:49:55] you write, you, you covered all this in a really good detail on your, on your blog, which is,
[01:50:00] which is cool. Uh, you get done. You come back, you acclimate. At what point did you go back and
[01:50:08] and go to Cordo Poxy again? I was month. So you just did. Yeah. And this time?
[01:50:16] Yeah, it was successful. Successful. Yeah. I'm crushing you. You got up there. And
[01:50:22] now you're here. What, what did you come to San Diego for? Because we've been trying to do this podcast for
[01:50:26] a while. No. And finally, and I was, I, I looked at your social media. Because I, I didn't know
[01:50:31] why you were coming out here. And then I put two and two together with your social media. Really,
[01:50:35] it's why you're coming out here. Yeah. I'm a way you're here for. I'm actually only in San Diego.
[01:50:41] Very briefly. I am headed down to Mexico to race the North 500. Explain with it in the
[01:50:47] North 500 days. It is pretty extreme off road race. And we're actually at me and a sweet friend of mine are actually
[01:50:55] racing and a rebuilt flyer vehicle. I'm a military vehicle. It's like a light strike vehicle.
[01:51:02] Right. I was pretty sweet. But for the miles, what kind of support do you get on that?
[01:51:06] I'm very none. So it's a, we have a pick crew, which is really one deed in a field truck that
[01:51:12] can kind of chase us down. But if you break down, I mean, you're going to be stuck there for hours.
[01:51:16] So. So you better hope your machine's running good. Yes, correct. And that's the next
[01:51:23] damn adventure on your list is that. Yeah. How long is it take to get that done?
[01:51:29] I only do it. I mean, you race them. And it's a consistent thing. So you'll, you're race today.
[01:51:33] I'll be back in San Diego on Sunday back in Colorado, Sunday night to hustle and work my tail off.
[01:51:40] And yeah. What are you working your tail off when you get back? Everything from speaking
[01:51:44] gigs to the real estate team that I do with my mom. I'm opening a CrossFit gym up here in
[01:51:49] Vista, um, dabbling with a bunch. But I'm going to work my work until Thanksgiving that I'm
[01:51:55] going to take some time off. Yeah. So those are the things that you've got on on on on the
[01:51:59] schedule right now, opening a gym real estate ski season is going to start. Yes. And I can't wait.
[01:52:06] So you'll be up there. Where do you usually snowboard out? All over like throwing
[01:52:11] for Gbelly. So it has been snowmass. Yep. And you live up in that area as well, right? Yes.
[01:52:16] Very lucky. Check. I mean, so we're kind of up to date right now. I wanted to cover one more
[01:52:24] little chunk of writing before we actually close it out. Could you get some really cool writing?
[01:52:32] Thank you. So here we go. I had joined the Marine Corps to serve people.
[01:52:35] Then in a mere 23 years old, I was looking to repurpose myself. Now at 27 years old,
[01:52:40] I'm still serving people just in a different capacity. Nothing about my injuries has been easy.
[01:52:46] But what I'm thankful for, regardless of the pain and grief are the people and experiences
[01:52:52] that have come my way. Four years ago, I was petrified of what my life may become.
[01:52:58] Now I couldn't be more proud. I fought for it. I worked for it harder than you can ever dream of.
[01:53:04] But I didn't get here alone. Family friends, believers, everyone who is there from the start. Thank you.
[01:53:14] Appreciate all of your days. Even when you're writing in the rain. In the beginning of my recovery,
[01:53:20] I struggled a lot and it made me a biter and sometimes mean person. How disabled do I have to make
[01:53:29] myself feel before I give up? How much easier would this be had I done it on two legs?
[01:53:38] My heart hurt in a way that then I couldn't even tell when I was hurting the people around me.
[01:53:45] Family included. Not that it's an excuse, but no that if I caused you any pain,
[01:53:52] I'm sorry. I'm not perfect. No one like claim to be. Realistically none of us ever will be.
[01:54:02] It's all about the progress over perfection and taking steps in the right direction.
[01:54:08] The last couple of years, I've been working on me as a whole. I've been focusing on the person.
[01:54:14] I want to be and recognizing a lot about the person I was. I've tried to surround myself with people
[01:54:19] who wish the best for others and build them up. Not break them down. I've stepped away from the
[01:54:26] toxic people that had a negative hold on me. If someone has wronged you, forgive them. Unshackle
[01:54:36] yourself from that pain. I started living my life for others, not for myself and life is so much
[01:54:45] sweeter that way. The truth is I'm doing more now than I ever did on two legs. I've been surrounded
[01:54:54] by people who keep me inspired and keep me looking onward and upward. Now I can't stop.
[01:55:05] I have suffered loss. That's no secret. But look at all I've gained. How the low points
[01:55:12] had the low points in my life not happened. I would not have had the amazing friendships or
[01:55:17] experiences I do. I'm thankful for the highs and the lows. Life has a funny way of putting us
[01:55:29] exactly where we are meant to be. Well, Curse the I think that it seems that you have been to put exactly
[01:55:41] where you are supposed to be on this path, living this amazing life and inspiring so many other
[01:55:50] people. Where can people find you? Yeah, I mean everyone can follow along on of course social media,
[01:55:57] Facebook and Instagram, just my name, Curse the Ns. But if you're interested in any of these blogs
[01:56:02] or the writing, they're all up on my foundation's website. So, Curse the Ns Foundation.org.
[01:56:06] Are you sure it's not Curse the Ns Foundation.com?
[01:56:10] It's both. Okay. Just checking. So, you know, one of us. Awesome. Awesome. So, you are really cool stuff
[01:56:19] that you post on that. The detailed description of your climbing are really, really cool.
[01:56:25] Is that documentary posted that you were talking about? No, yeah. Okay. So, we'll be waiting for that.
[01:56:30] Let me know. So, I can repost it. No, awesome. Just awesome to talk to you. I know that we,
[01:56:38] we try and stay on the path around here. You know, the path, the righteous path. Yes, sir.
[01:56:44] Yeah, Coach, I'll speak another righteous path. Yeah. Curse the leading from the front. What can we do
[01:56:49] ourselves to kind of move down the path? You know, Rob is speaking. Plany can. Plany stuff.
[01:56:55] Um, but first, there it is. But first, well, you know, like throughout the story,
[01:57:03] you know, there's little pockets of maybe like, oh wait, well, you know, small detail. So,
[01:57:07] you said the pilot was D.O.R. What does D.O.R mean? Drop on request. Oh, thank.
[01:57:12] Meaning I don't want to do this anymore. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Also, I thought, you know,
[01:57:19] that we mentioned like how you'd have, um, like challenges with your memory. Like just going to the
[01:57:24] bathroom, like hey, why am I here kind of think? Yep. You've watched the movie Momental?
[01:57:27] Oh, my goodness. No, but you were the second person at the time of that in two days. Yeah,
[01:57:31] I should definitely watch that movie. It's very cool. Yeah. So, it's the guy, you know what it's about
[01:57:35] the end. It's about this guy. Lannard. He doesn't like to be called Lannian. Anyway, he has short-term
[01:57:42] memory loss, right? So he can't make new memories. He has long-term and so he can do like
[01:57:48] habitual stuff. You know, stuff that I guess he uses a different part of your brain. So like habitual
[01:57:52] stuff, driving a car like that kind of stuff you can do. And he has his long-term memory, like he knows
[01:57:56] about his wife and his who he is and stuff. But he can't, he basically he goes to the bathroom,
[01:58:01] like why am I here? Yeah. So he has all these tattoos kind of like you except his are like notes,
[01:58:08] you know, like, like, yourself. Yeah, but they're everywhere, you know. And then he takes these polaroids
[01:58:13] of the people. So it's like, oh, yeah, I know you, you know, and then it's really good and it
[01:58:17] goes backwards. The movie goes backwards. So you don't it's like you follow along with them.
[01:58:22] You know. So it's like, oh, how did he get there? And you don't know, you know, he'll just wake up
[01:58:26] in the room with an empty bottle. I'll be like, I don't know. It's like naked, you know, like that kind.
[01:58:32] And you're like, oh, I didn't that have you, you know, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
[01:58:35] That's what you remind me of the whole bathroom thing. But as far as the path goes,
[01:58:42] we're doing you to do what it starts. You ever try your energy to do to surprise me because isn't
[01:58:50] it interesting? You snowboard. I don't know how to snowboard. And these may or may not apply to you
[01:58:57] because you're different. I think, but I don't know how to snowboard. I probably couldn't climb
[01:59:04] I can barely climb my driveway. You're talking about everything, all these things. I don't have
[01:59:09] a hair salon. You don't say. Yeah. Many reasons. And I have two legs, you know, and I don't know.
[01:59:17] It seems like, you know, like when you say, okay, it depends on how you react to like all these things.
[01:59:23] It's like your reaction is like you chose to go for like these huge reactions.
[01:59:28] It's not like this weird, impossible thing, you know. It's like, if you have everything kind of
[01:59:34] in front of you, you're less likely to have that big reaction. You mean if everything is
[01:59:40] almost easy for you to achieve, you'd have a less of a probability of trying to make it happen. Yeah.
[01:59:45] And then as a certain, I guess with you, you were kind of always like that, right?
[01:59:51] Yeah. Yeah. You're like, okay, I'm going to make things happen in this.
[01:59:56] Maybe extra ordinary way. You know, good or bad, or, you know, mischievous or whatever,
[02:00:03] like you can, you kind of started with that. So I guess in the big picture kind of makes sense.
[02:00:08] You know, but then from the outside, you kind of look in, but yeah, like you know how you say it,
[02:00:11] or you've talked about this before, where if you're handed everything, yeah, you know, like you won't go
[02:00:19] case important. What are the chances that you would be attempting to summon Everest if you
[02:00:25] got out of the Marine Corps after six years? And you know what I mean? Like it's just, you have these challenges
[02:00:32] and because it's like because they're hard and even harder than normal, that you want to do
[02:00:38] them even more. Yes, no exactly. That's kind of what you're saying. Yeah. Well, I think too, like,
[02:00:43] I'm like an obnoxious thinking competitive person, but not necessarily with other people.
[02:00:48] And it's just, I look at what I did yesterday and I say, okay, well, what can I do a little bit more?
[02:00:52] Whether that's something physical or mental or whatever? But then also like, honestly, I mean,
[02:00:57] I'm not the fastest person out there. I struggle my way up. I'm not perfect out in the mountains
[02:01:01] or anything that I'm doing. But I really do. I hope that there's somebody out there watching
[02:01:05] me and they said to health cursey, I can do it better than her. And then I hope that they try.
[02:01:10] I mean, that's what it's about. You know, like, I want some to see it. Do it.
[02:01:14] Kind of goes to show. Also, you talk better than me too, by the way. So there's that.
[02:01:21] Yeah, multiple brain damage, fear, the. Nothing happened to my jaw. Yeah.
[02:01:27] And then you talk way better than me. So like I said, it goes to show anyway. You did too.
[02:01:31] Oh, you've done due to the two. So are you currently doing due to two? No, I was training for a little bit
[02:01:36] of the night. And then I really fell in love with MMA and then just boxing. Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:41] Yeah, yeah. We're good with all the above, actually. Yeah. We just like, we just like that you
[02:01:45] scrap. Yes. Fighting in general is good. Well, I mean, I think when I started training as when I
[02:01:51] realized, like, I'm an anger little person. And it's good to get it out. I like it.
[02:01:56] And then you elbow. I'm just saying. Yeah.
[02:01:58] And then you. That's good. Well, these are all elements of the path included on the path. So
[02:02:04] as far as jujitsu goes, if you do geek, you need a geek. If you do geek. Yeah.
[02:02:08] Which you show hand in hand. I think you should, you can do one or the other. I guess, but
[02:02:13] ideally geek, no geek both. Well, what are you trying to get to is we have a company. We make
[02:02:19] jujitsu geese. We make rash guards. We make t-shirts. Sure. And we make them all in America, which is
[02:02:26] awesome from the dirt to the shirt, from the dirt to the shirt, from the cotton to the from the seed to the
[02:02:32] bee. All made. And we're actually making jeans to make it. Yeah. American. Yeah. American.
[02:02:39] Yeah. Don't dare to. Yeah. Jocca doesn't like fashion or fashion. Don't think you're right. The
[02:02:46] both. I think I'm a fashion or a fashion. I wasn't a aesthetic. Uh, like that's why you
[02:02:52] know about cosmopolitan. So cosmopolitan. It's like the if you think magazines, what do you think
[02:02:59] people time. Do you think that's more polished? You're too magazine. And you just
[02:03:03] make it. Yeah. But. Cosmopolitan magazines anymore. No, that's why they're out there making videos.
[02:03:09] Cosmopolitan. They're out there making videos because they know no one's reading a magazine. It's
[02:03:14] for you. You know what? I will tell you. I used to be a sucker for. I'm talking maybe
[02:03:19] even even up to eight years ago. If I was in the airport, I'd like walk through this shop and see
[02:03:27] like a magazine. Right? I don't know if it was a gun magazine. I don't know if it was a car magazine.
[02:03:32] I don't know if it was a outdoor magazine. But like one of those magazines, I'd say, oh, you know,
[02:03:37] I got a flight. Hey, I'll read this magazine eight years ago. I may have bought. I would, there was
[02:03:44] a 70% chance that I'd see a magazine. It looked kind of cool. And I'd get the magazine. Right now,
[02:03:50] there is a zero percent chance of getting a paper magazine. Yeah. Zero percent. Yeah. That's, I mean,
[02:03:56] I guess one, what do you call it? The people who like they learn they yearning for the past,
[02:04:00] what is it? What is it? What is it? Kind of person. A person that yearns for the past.
[02:04:03] Anyway, there's a word for that kind of person anyway. So it may be that part of me,
[02:04:07] maybe still likes. Get you to that speech. See, see, get things working. I'm so
[02:04:12] over to my word recollection. See, I can't, you understand what I'm saying. Anyway,
[02:04:18] people who are nostalgic like that, they like the physical magazine. I'm one of those people. Yeah.
[02:04:22] But here's the thing, which, I mean, I'm, you probably realize this, you have your phone. So like,
[02:04:26] yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, I'm a person. You can read,
[02:04:30] you know, all the stuff that you read or whatever, you're that is what I'm saying. You don't need
[02:04:34] the physical magazine anymore. And then you got to lug around a physical magazine. You're done with
[02:04:38] what I'm saying. That's why I'm saying no one's reading the magazine anymore. Even me. And I
[02:04:42] used to buy them. Yeah, but that's why. That's why. But that's something. But that doesn't
[02:04:46] explain. Do you get magazines? No. I think the back cookbooks. But that's not a magazine. No.
[02:04:52] Oh, there's a cook. We call a week all a cookbook magazine. I'm a cook magazine. Oh, yeah,
[02:04:58] I like the magazine. Yeah, like, we don't know. It's a black-to-cooking. You like to cook? I do. Yes.
[02:05:03] Uh, you're as lit up right there. I love to go. You love to eat. Yes. Both. Yes. I love to eat.
[02:05:14] It's not that I don't love to cook or even really like to do it. I just maybe not that great at it.
[02:05:20] You like to do that. I can do it. I can make a good salad. Yeah. Funny. I can make a good steak. So
[02:05:27] anyways, origin USA origin main.com. If you want any of this stuff, we also have supplements.
[02:05:34] You've been drinking some chocolate, chocolate, white tea over there. Yeah, what you're verdict.
[02:05:38] I'm a fan. I think it's great. You got a big smile on your face. Yeah.
[02:05:41] More than you had earlier. I think it. I think it not only gives you an 8,000 pound
[02:05:44] deadlift. It will make you smile on you. Well, in a way, it kind of is misleading because when you
[02:05:49] look at the can, there's no like, high-biscuits or pomegranate, like fruity,
[02:05:54] tartare and so the magic image. Yeah. That's right. I'm not going to joke.
[02:05:58] It's tactical. It looks kind of tactically, seems ain't like it. But then when you drink it certified
[02:06:04] organic, goiny and very light, very refreshing, seems same. So it's like a thing. So like when you
[02:06:08] drink it, you're pleasantly surprised. I think on a subconscious level. Yeah, so we've got to
[02:06:13] bunch of different things and one thing I do have to say is we got, so I make this a little drink.
[02:06:19] It's called discipline and there's a powder form. And we just came out with a powder form.
[02:06:23] that's called jockel. Do you like do you like Arnold Palmer's? I do. Okay, so I'm I like I love them.
[02:06:30] I said I made that right there. It's called jockel Palmer. That's hilarious. Yeah, well, I
[02:06:34] ran a lot. We did away with it for with it for, but yeah, so anyways, it tastes so good. It tastes like
[02:06:42] the best Arnold Palmer that you get from, you know, the restaurant Arnold Palmer's when they do a good job.
[02:06:48] Oh, good job. Okay, you go. Oh, you say Arnold Palmer and they just they just do a good job. And you're like, yes
[02:06:55] This is kind of what it's like. So anyways, that's available and a bunch of other supplements.
[02:07:00] Mulk, joint warfare,
[02:07:02] krill krill, super, super, krill, oil. Yeah, that's for your kids.
[02:07:07] Mulk, for your kid. For your kid. For when your kids need something good to eat.
[02:07:12] And instead of giving them level nine cheetos. Yeah. No, don't get them that. So yeah, you can get that.
[02:07:21] Yeah, all in origin, main.com. It should be and.org apparently because actually that's smart
[02:07:28] when you do the dot org and the dot com. So, and you know, when you go and go daddy and they tell you,
[02:07:33] hey, you want to buy the dot org, the dot net, the dot, uh, dot TV dot whatever dot biz, you know, all this stuff or
[02:07:39] whatever, you say yes, if you have a good name, you say yes to all of those. That's a good strategy.
[02:07:43] Yes. See, way ahead of the camera. Like it. She's not for there. Just get them. And then the last
[02:07:48] origin, main.com. That's the go to as we can get this good stuff. Yeah. Also, we have a store. It's called
[02:07:56] Jocco store. See, you're probably going to kind of figure out real together. Yeah. You know, it's
[02:08:02] an end. So, Jocco Palmer is not a genius name. I know. It's a name as a result of lack of
[02:08:10] genius. Okay. You're like, Arnold Palmer. There's genius. There's a good boy. There's genius in
[02:08:15] some. Let me some credit. Actually, that is true. Nonetheless, so if Joc once an online store was
[02:08:21] going to go bottom line is I'm so unoriginal that I just, starting with this podcast, I just said,
[02:08:26] we'll just call it Jocco podcast and now it's like sort of just everything. Yeah. Hey, we need
[02:08:31] a online store. What do we call it? We don't do it that way. No, no, no. Because now you look back,
[02:08:36] if, if like four years ago, someone would say, okay, you're going to name all your stuff.
[02:08:43] Jocco. I would've been like, no, that's, that's dumb. Yeah. But it didn't happen like that.
[02:08:47] It happened like a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, next thing you know, you got Jocco
[02:08:51] publishing. What? How did that even happen? The thing is a big picture, long game. It does make sense.
[02:08:58] Yeah. No, no. Actually smart. I think you, the genius in simplicity, I think,
[02:09:02] disapplies here. So nonetheless, JoccoStore.com is where you can get your shirts and
[02:09:07] rash guards tank to all these stuff while you're representing on the path, disciplining equals freedom.
[02:09:12] There's, I haven't really talked about this too much, but a guy, okay, so we got a t-shirt
[02:09:17] that says discipline equals freedom in it. I don't want to say it's iconic, but there's only one
[02:09:23] place in the world that you can get this t-shirt. This dude just got arrested in somewhere in his mugshot
[02:09:30] is him. He's wearing a discipline equals freedom t-shirt. And he's sporting this thing.
[02:09:35] Yeah. And what he did was apparently there was some kind of altercation and he beat up two people
[02:09:40] and then dropped them off somewhere. Like out there, how? Yeah. Because what I think there were like
[02:09:44] rugby players or something like, here's the thing. So when he, when I saw that article, you sent me that article.
[02:09:49] He wasn't as much as it was his court appeared. Yeah. So he wears the destroyer actively went
[02:09:55] to court. It wasn't like he got rolled up and then he just, he even courted. This is what he decided
[02:10:00] to wear to court. He's representing on the path. On the path. What serious? Because a lot of people
[02:10:04] were like, oh, he's not on the path. Obviously he's getting arrested and rolled up. You were kind of like,
[02:10:08] no, no, no, read a little bit more. I said, hey, we all represent the path in our own way. And this
[02:10:14] guy is no different. So basically as far as the article goes, what I got from it was, okay,
[02:10:20] him and his other friends who he probably found annoying at the time, they were drinking.
[02:10:28] Some argument ensued in the car. He beat them both up. Real bad.
[02:10:33] Okay. I don't know if it was in the car before that. That's where it gets a little bit of like
[02:10:37] if you're friends, you can't beat them up real bad. Wait, wait, wait, what is real bad if you
[02:10:41] insist? Well, they said they will, okay. And then the guys who got beat up, they were saying,
[02:10:46] oh, I'm like, what are you threatening injuries or maybe they're lawyer or somebody was saying, oh,
[02:10:50] my gosh, I'm critical. And then the medical professionals, they were like,
[02:10:56] whatever they got beat up. They caught a beat down from the discipline he calls freedom guy. That's what
[02:11:01] happened. Okay. Acting annoying and dropped. That's what I'm then he dropped him off at their house.
[02:11:05] Okay. At this point, I will not issue and approved or disapproved. I'm remaining neutral
[02:11:10] at this time until further evidence comes forth and I can make a decision whether these actions were
[02:11:16] approved or disapproved. Yeah. Agreed. But like I say, we all represent about in our own way.
[02:11:24] Unless he got that shirt, whether this means anything or not to us, even though it does,
[02:11:30] he got it from jockelstore.com. So he can get and it's not just kind of crazy. There's other ones.
[02:11:36] Is this beat? Because a little while ago in UFC, there was a guy wearing the shirt and like a bunch of people.
[02:11:42] So now we're sort of this is headline news. Yeah, your means to it. Well, my brother text
[02:11:46] me is like, hey, your your mainstream now. You know, listen to this. Speaking of tangents. So
[02:11:53] my uncles were both used car salesmen and there was a crime that happened in the town where
[02:12:03] one of my uncles was a used car salesman and at the crime scene, it was close to his used car
[02:12:08] locked and in the picture that they took of the crime scene in the background, you could see the
[02:12:15] sign for his, you know, VIX used cars. You could see in the background in the sign on the front page
[02:12:22] and my uncle, because my uncles are hilarious. They cut it out. They sent it to my mom and he
[02:12:28] would, you might uncle cut out the picture sent it to my mom and said, I told you I would make it
[02:12:33] big time. And he might even want to come from here. So there you go. So we kind of, you know,
[02:12:40] it's not nothing. We made that. Oh, it's not nothing. Yes. Yeah, we made the news. We're in criminal justice.
[02:12:47] You know, that's where ever you go. It's just, it's just all happening. All right, real quick.

[02:13:53] desk roll at the gym. So the studio is at the gym for those of you. No, no, that's got to
[02:13:56] Victor, a gym called Victory MMA in San Diego, California. The studio is in the gym. We were downstairs.
[02:14:03] We were waiting for her courtesy to show up. And the front desk roll goes, hey,
[02:14:08] Jockel, I got a phone call someone wants to know where to train. Do you get to in this city?
[02:14:12] In some city. Then I'm not going to say in case the point, however, you know,
[02:14:15] privacy act or whatever. So, he's a front desk roll. Because says, what should I tell him? And I said,
[02:14:22] whoa, here, give me the phone. And I like pulled up and I go, hey, man, what's going on?
[02:14:28] And he's like, Jockel, I was like, hey, bro, what's happening? I hear you're looking at
[02:14:32] training your Jitsu in your city. And I pulled out Google Maps. I was like, hey, there's a cool place
[02:14:36] here. There's a bunch of good places. Yeah, you're good to go. And he's like, he's like, hey, man,
[02:14:39] he goes, I was on Crystal Mf for seven years. He goes, I started listening to your podcast. I'm
[02:14:47] clean. My family's back in order. My job is back in order. Please keep doing what you're doing.
[02:14:54] I'm starting to train Jitsu. And I was like, bro, see you, I'll keep doing what I'm doing. You stay
[02:15:01] on the path and stay clean. So right on to you out there, you know who you are. Now I'm not saying
[02:15:09] if you call victory MMA in fitness, that I'm going to answer because I'm not. I was probably the first time
[02:15:13] I've talked on the phone here in a year. Yeah. So also, that's not to be confused with you using
[02:15:20] trooper soap or Jockel soap. I'm going to rehabilitate your drugs. It will not help your
[02:15:26] crystal method and fed me to have it. It might, but that's not the thing. Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.
[02:15:30] You can't claim it, but there's little triggers that you could have that could make you want to stay
[02:15:33] clean. Maybe that soap, goat soap, it's bottom of them. You could be super stoked with that.

[02:16:00] Now, first you should go and see where's that picture posted of you with your freaking face.
[02:16:07] It's on Instagram and Facebook. Ripped open. Yeah, I'm going to fit my face through the
[02:16:12] lower right side of my face. You can see tea is that teeth you can see in there. You can see like white
[02:16:16] stuff. It's too little teeth. Like my jaw was shattered and just unhinged so it's just
[02:16:20] kind of like hanging there. Is it the kind of picture on Instagram and the kind where it's like
[02:16:25] blurred out with the eyeball with the cross over it where you got to click properly. You know,
[02:16:29] I would guess it is. I don't think so. I don't think so. I bet if you repost it, if you repost it,
[02:16:35] you'll be like they'll they'll tell what's that called blurred out. Like a sensor for approval.
[02:16:40] Something. Yeah. Dang. Do it. Well, yeah. Then now you can see what you currently
[02:16:45] looks like in black and white by the way, but you're just saying you know, in black and white. It's available on the YouTube channel.
[02:16:52] When people meet me, they go, oh, you're in color. That's what I think they say and you know,
[02:16:57] let's say, say to me, you're shorter than I thought you would do. I get it all the time,
[02:17:02] do you? I'm 5. 11 and they're like, oh, you're not as tall. Well, I shouldn't say everyone says that to me,
[02:17:09] but like I would say 10% of people. See, you know, 5% of people say, say, you're not shorter than I
[02:17:14] thought you were going to be. And I say, oh, cool. They said it about you too. I will. That's that's
[02:17:18] interesting because you know what people tell me? You're way bigger than me. That's for obvious reasons.

[02:17:52] code out of that. I was talking to you today and he told me to tell you, oh, he said, tell her, she's a,
[02:17:58] he said, man, he said, tell her she's a badass. I'll let her know, man, let her know. So your
[02:18:04] code of mire, badass of all badass says you are a badass. So check out FlipsideGamis.com if you want to get

[02:19:26] extreme ownership. We got dichotomy leadership. All those books about how to lead and win in your life
[02:19:34] and leading the team that you work with. We got echelon front, which is my leadership consultancy.
[02:19:40] We saw problems through leadership. Go to echelon front dot com for details. EF online, get the same
[02:19:45] training interactive online. EF online dot com. We got the master coming up in Sydney, Australia.
[02:19:52] By the way, have you been, Australia? I have. Did you love Australia? I love it. Where were you
[02:19:58] in Australia? I went to Brisee, too. I was, it was so awesome. I loved it. It was so awesome.
[02:20:08] And so we're doing a big event down there and definitely looking forward to it's in Sydney. It's
[02:20:14] December, fourth and fifth. Here's the thing. Some people think, oh, it's not going to sell out.
[02:20:18] If you're thinking that, you're not correct. You're not correct because every event that we've
[02:20:23] done has sold out. Some people have said, well, are you going to go to Brisbane? Are you going to go to
[02:20:27] Perth? The answer is no. We are not a rock band on tour. We're not hitting every city in Australia.
[02:20:34] We're not, we're not hitting every city in America. We're doing, we do one or two. This is probably,
[02:20:39] we probably won't go back to Australia for five years. That's one of my guess is right now. We
[02:20:47] probably won't go back to Australia for five years because we'll do Europe, then we'll do Asia.
[02:20:52] So, like you see what I'm saying. So if you're, if you're in Australia or you're New Zealand
[02:20:57] or you're somewhere in that area of the world and you want to come to a monster, come to the one
[02:21:03] that is taking place December, fourth and fifth. We also have a year of Overwatch for
[02:21:10] veterans that are looking to be placed into companies that need leadership. Go to EF
[02:21:17] Overwatch.com and on top of all that, if you just feel like you haven't gotten enough right now,
[02:21:26] you haven't gotten enough of me. If you hadn't gotten enough of Echo, you haven't gotten enough of
[02:21:31] Kirstie yet. Cool. This conversation will continue on the social media into webs on Twitter,
[02:21:38] on Instagram and on that. Kirstie is first of all Kirstie NSfoundation.org and.com.
[02:21:52] Kirstie Instagram, Kirstie underscore NS Twitter, Kirstie NS and it's KIRST. IE and then NS
[02:22:03] KIRST. And Echo is Atacle Charles and I am at Jockel Willink. Echo, do you have anything else?
[02:22:11] No, sir. No, ma'am. Good to see you. Good to meet you.
[02:22:14] Like, why does things for having me? Kirstie, any closing thoughts for you?
[02:22:20] Yeah. I mean, I just want people to realize that me climbing all of these big,
[02:22:24] you know, ridiculous mountains all over the world. It's more than it just being about me.
[02:22:28] You know, I'm doing it for the people that need to hope, you know, somebody that needs inspiration
[02:22:32] or even just the non-believers really waiting for me to prove them wrong. And even more,
[02:22:37] so like I'm doing this with heart and passion and purpose. And you know, even for example,
[02:22:41] like when I was out and Everest, I mean, in my organization helped establish the first ever wheelchair
[02:22:48] program over in Nepal for 25 APT orphans. You know, when we were just down on Ecuador, we actually had
[02:22:53] seven amputees standing on top of Kota Paxi. So, you know, this really is, it's just about
[02:22:58] paying it forward and helping, you know, get the adaptive community into the outdoors and hopefully
[02:23:03] encouraging, you know, other people regardless of whatever you're adversity that you're facing,
[02:23:08] you know, to go outside and, you know, and find what really sets your heart on fire.
[02:23:12] It's been a legit honor to sit down with you to meet with you. And I definitely,
[02:23:18] absolutely thank you for coming on the show. I know it's a scary time commitment.
[02:23:23] Especially when I tell you it's got my beef, you know, we've done podcasts that are four or five
[02:23:28] hours long, but so it's awesome. And it's awesome for me to have the opportunity to share your
[02:23:33] story and it's honored to be able to do that. So thank you for coming on. More important than that,
[02:23:39] thank you for your service and your sacrifice and the Marine Corps. On top of that, thank you for
[02:23:46] your continued service today with what you're doing with your foundation. And on top of that,
[02:23:51] but what you do every day to show the rest of us the path and set an example for for everybody.
[02:24:02] So thank you for all that and the rest of the service members out there.
[02:24:06] Worldwide, currently serving or who have served.
[02:24:12] Thank you for your service and your sacrifice and thanks for keeping us free and here at home to our
[02:24:17] police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers,
[02:24:23] board of patrol, secret service. All the first responders that there are,
[02:24:28] thank you for keeping us safe on the home front and to everyone else out there.
[02:24:38] We all suffer losses. We all are going to have highs and lows in our
[02:24:47] lives. We can all be petrified of what the future may hold and we can all have set backs and doubts
[02:24:56] and pain. That's what's going to happen in life. But if you can look at someone like
[02:25:07] Christy and you can follow her lead and you fight for it and you work for it and you work through it.
[02:25:16] Those losses and those setbacks and that pain will make you better.
[02:25:25] So as Christy said, appreciate the days.
[02:25:29] Every day, then get on the path and stay on the path by getting out there and getting after it.
[02:25:39] And until next time, this is Christy and us and echo and jocco out.
