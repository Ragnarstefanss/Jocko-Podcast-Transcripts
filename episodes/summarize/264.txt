But he was like, he cared, you know, so he was like, he's like, I get it, you know, you want to, you don't want to stop the red light, I get it whatever he's like, but man, like, I don't want, I don't want to have to give you a ticket, you know, for running red lights. Knock him out if you have to, you know, like you can do these kind of things, but you can be just like violating all kinds of, you know, see, because it's not going to war. But it's my way of letting you know, this is important not because I want you to be on time, but because I want to know what's going on with you. But each, yeah, each level has it like a little threshold, like I said, but yes, the most prominent one is like, yeah. Like, well, actually, and I had to say this the other day, I'm like, actually, because I was like, what do you do with echoing these late all the time? We got to like, we got to act because this person is violent towards us or whatever, and then it's a straight up fight where you can expect like, laws to be broken within that fight kind of thing. That could be an example of total war and versus conventional war, like which war was like a total war. Well, he was 19 when he won the World Champion became the best in the world and total dominant prodigy in the game and and the guy basically said, you know, well, who kind of who's better and you didn't come right out and say it, but it was implied and and Gary Kasparov understood the implication and there was a couple things that he said one one thing that he said that was interesting he said basically said I'm too old the compete. And by the way, if I want Dave to be at point A, and I know that Dave knows to go to point A, I don't care how he gets there, but what's important is that allows me to look forward to look to the next point, to look to point B or C or D. Because I'm not worried about how Dave's going to get there. And then there's like one before where it's like, okay, we got to like put our hands on him. It's sort of like we got other things going on, and we all kind of know that. And if you do what you were just talking about, if the more you think in decentralized command, the more you think in commanders intent, the more you think strategically, unless you care about those details, oh wait, oh, you want the same thing, dude, go do whatever you want. Yeah, I mean, the culture, the hierarchy of the culture is kind of like people understand it even though it might not be able to be like 100% tangible. I'm not saying it's a good thing, but I'm saying it's not under most, you know, a lot of circumstances like this bad thing to be late. I'm so sorry, you know, I will never do it again for us, you know, like, it's really that feeling that I got from the guy, he let me go. If you throw some ambiguous stuff at you, like you're going to be like, okay, and then cut right through and then ask later, there are questions. So you came to me like, hey, I really want to, you know, really want some more money for this. When you think of it not in a linear way like, oh, this is what you're going to do, but this is the entire way of thinking. We really can't just throw out that that's the significant you know like all right we'll go do a metcon for how long is the chest match you'd say I don't know tournament. There's another reason why that is, especially if that is actually a thing you actually mean that it's not like some game you're playing to like, hey, bro. And he's like, yeah, you know, I'm, you know, I'm, I forget what he said, but he was real ambiguous about his training, but he implied that he had a lot. He was like, but he, that's how he acted the way you're talking to, where he'd be like, hey, he didn't give me, he gave me a little warning. It's like, oh, yeah, because it's a little tiny decision with almost no risk, but we're going to do it immediately and then we're going to get feedback You know, like, it's almost comparable with the guy who's just like a 500 street fight. You know, like first, it's like straight up friendly and the better you can get roadhouse quotes in here. I always like telling these stories though, because I know Jocca's over there thinking, I don't like to rely on machines. There's competition going on between those two people and the little subtle, the little subtle preferences or statements or comments that you make impact that competition and can create animosity where you should be as a leader trying to unify your team. And then right, when I let them do it, I usually, I usually give them like a, like, I give them enough time, maybe even another, two, three, four minutes. You know, the kind of like, I had, it was probably more appropriate to stop than run, you know, you just, anyway. So like total war is like, we don't have time for the police to come. Because you're going to like about that, it's like, hey, it doesn't matter. Now, is there a burger to things that if you cross, you're going to, like, it's going to be a real problem. It reflects that total work kind of situation where, you know, like, let's go to that end part of the spectrum, right? You know, you're kind of like, wait, am I going to hear about it? I said, we got to we got to go to war with them, but we don't want them to know it.
