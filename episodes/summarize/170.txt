It's kind of like, you know the, it's like, not linear, but you know the path of, like, from start to finish that whole path is like a big creative learning battle fight twins losses like a, it's a whole path. It's like, you know, like, you know, like, people have a routine, like, tenet, you know, every night for 30 minutes, they watch TV with their kids or whatever. Way more than you would think anyway, because, you know, even when I'm like real busy, you know, if I can accurately remember my day, I can remember like just like five minutes here, 15 minutes there, like that I did something that was a waste of time. But if you're like trying to read, you know, if you want to read more, whatever, consider like, even like, let's say we start recording this for a second, we're going to look at the boss of our phones. But because it's like the frustration is like pushing you know, but then it's like at the end of the day, it's all just one big game, you know. You know, like, if you're like, okay, good, you know, you got me out. Like you like you like double leg or whatever you like grab. Yeah, so almost like, actually straight up, where doing the right thing and avoiding conflict is kind of like, they're not that opposite, you know, where doing the avoiding, you should, and I'm totally just interpreting this, trying to do it. I know real, but the thing is like for a, and I say from the outside, I can see how that could, you know what I don't like. And then you know how like when you vacuum over like I don't know, let's say it's a big piece of land. Well, what bothers me the most about this question is, I feel like I feel like I feel like I don't do a good job of explaining this. You know, when you go to the doctor and he's asking, oh, yeah, like all the stuff you see him writing down, you know, in your chart, whatever, even though a doctor situation is good, because you want him to go evaluate it later, whatever, you don't give you cure, but same deal, man, same deal, you're with those notes. And the thing is, right when the timer goes off when we're done, it's like, it's like a avalanche of like, She's elective. I'm like, there it's kind of like, it's kind of like, sure. but it's like at, you know how like when then you know what else you'll do? Yeah, if they were like having an individual meeting, I would dig it, and then, but if they're like taking notes, I'd be like, wait, where are you taking notes? So if you had a camera like once you said like, imagine your video, video tape, like, what if you were being video tape all day? And you actually get this weird, like, well, I actually, like, I'm going to learn a little something from this right here. You know, like, when you, when you want to, like, you double guy out any once to start from that same position or whatever. And for you, it's real specific because it's like rolling with you isn't like this, it's like, very specific scenario. Like, oh, like, or all like push here or something. You haven't ever like jumped and like put a rear-note could choke on or something like that. Like if you are discipline with your time, you will have a lot of free time, like a lot, a lot of free time. And know that if they put up a video that has, if they put up a thumbnail of a video, and it's got a heavy machine gun in it, they know they got a good chance I'm going to click on it. What do you think is the, like, the biggest ones that people are, you know, that you know, the biggest activities that they could, versus the short game, you know, where it's like, and we can keep that perspective, these things become a little bit more clear, you know, they always do. It's more like, okay, I'm going to put together this, like, defense and combine with this little thing and whatever. But I could see, you know what, though, from an offensive standpoint, like from your position and someone's like, okay, we start from there. Like you don't pull and he probably probably be like, I'm not, I know. You know, in his head, it is, you know, it's like, okay, this is my fault. And then they're like, then they want to keep going like, as if that just didn't happen. And when you write it down, it's kind of like, bro, like, you're going to take all this information and sort of do some sort of evaluation for me. Unless you think like, oh, yeah, overcome fear, meaning like, I'm not scared of it anymore. Hey, do you know, like dig in and when you dig in on stuff, then you have less of a chance of something going wrong. Well, it's not about, like, okay, I'm going to like beat up, Joc. Yeah, I mean, you said it like, you're like, oh, long you've been married. It's like, is there a time where it's like, hey, there's gonna be conflict? But I was like, I started like going into this whole pitch to my friend. It's like kind of, like, if you're saying you could read.
