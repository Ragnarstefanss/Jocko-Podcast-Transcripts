You know, like some people, they'll be like, oh, I'm going to, you know, like, I'm doomed anyway. It's like when people throw around the word trees and, you know, you know, you know, how like when when people get into political debates, oh, around, oh, that's treason. It's like, you know, I can't think of an example, you know how someone will like, he'll say, I don't know, a cable actually, you know what it was? It's not helpful to, you know, or people don't like his ideas or whatever, like for a specific reason, you know, rather than identify the reason, they just like package them up and put a ugly bow tie on it. Like it wasn't like, hey, give me your like, hey, you know, yeah, yeah. Like maybe you're like, I got a job and you're like, like, I might get that promotion. And then they go in and they're like, okay, it's like, you know, like, I made the analogy of the guy on major league, right? Whenever, yeah, but also, like, if I can hope I can live, then that can make you like, like, fight a little bit longer. Well, yeah, I mean, you're going to be a, you know, and it's like, hey, this guy looks like he could be a travel or something. That's like, you know, but like, yeah, but think about this situation. I could be, if I have a different attitude, I could be like, why, why fight it kind of thing, but death, impending doom, you know, just kind of take its course kind of thing. Because right, if you have no hope, you can be like, well, I'm just going to just going to kill myself. Or maybe it's the kind of, you know, how here, you'll say, like, hey, he's, he's in a ledger, you know, before you're proven in the court of the lock, maybe you're in that window. And I said to him, you know, we were kind of like, you know, Dakota's so good to go and so awesome. And I was like, you didn't, I mean at that point, I'm like, you just, you know, you lost your whole team. And it's like, well, or even like everyone's going to read this book. It was going to be like really good like produced video. You know, kind of thing, you know, like, Like, if I want to be out, like if I want to escape, not that I want to do the escape or take escape tight actions, it's just, I don't want to be there. So it's like, yeah, if you hope you'll get part in and you hold onto that hope, but you get let down, it'll create, you know, it'll drive you insane. And it's like, I see what you did there, you know, and each one, but it's like, you're just being funny. Then believe me, I mean, I saw plenty of people like act like that in the military, and they were hated by their troops. And then, but whereas if you're like, hey, you're not getting promoted, you be like, all right. and I'm just looking at you like, like please get the hint that my face right now means stop. Hey, I got no hope, so I'm just going to lay here and like, I guess that's what you were saying. Depends on what kind of strength to, I feel like, I don't know, hope of what to do in a life or life. So it goes through whole, like this first chapters, it goes through from like the revolution all the way through after the war. You know what you, you know, I think the thing is here, you got to pay attention as a human to what the hope is doing to you.
