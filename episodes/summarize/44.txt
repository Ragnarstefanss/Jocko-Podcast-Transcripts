You know, I gotta check that Yeah, the feelings versus behavior thing I think is well, it's one of those things where when you know the problem that's like because this person's obviously ahead of the game You know, they know you know, they know this is what's causing okay? you're purple heart he was a tail gunner just to just a bad ask guy and so we me and my buddies we thought Charles Bronson was the man so we had our band we called it bronzons children so we run that shirt people that might be something people are going to like but who's gonna look at that and no have any idea what they're gonna be like hey that kind of looks like Charles Bronson doesn't even kind of look like Charles it straight up looks like Charles Bronson That's that's The beautiful thing when you can put your ego in check and you can make that happen Making your own boss look good having an open mind to new ideas those are the things that's how you put your ego and check those are the things that Those are the those are the hallmarks of having your ego and check now sometimes people don't know when They need to put their ego in check and I think there's one really easy indicator to know when you need it just at least Like doing assessment of your ego and that is when you come into conflict with another person because because That huge percentage of conflicts that you have with other people are ego are their ego and I can handle it when when maybe others cannot when when bad things are happening I am going to try and be the one good thing the thing standing tall that can be relied upon because I know that that attitude will spread that will bolster those around me and we will fight and in fighting we will win and if not the battle and if not the war we will win because our spirit it will never surrender in that that is the ultimate victory to hold your head high and even even in the face of inescapable defeat to stand and to fight that is to win and I think that's all I've got for tonight echo let's close this thing out a little bit before we do that though let's talk about how the people that are listening to this if you want to listen to more of it what's the best way to support the podcast what's the best way to getting the game here with the boys help us keep rolling this thing out what's the best way to go do you want to clarify getting the game means a lot and I'm saying that's a good way to support you know like sure some get the shirts I would say go go that go jockelstore.com go there look at the shirts you know like I'm not getting nothing but just look could you get a rash card there if you're so inclined to get a rash card you can get a rash card for sure the rash cards are good I think that's almost like on a factual level where they're good See so you gotta get in their heads you gotta get them out of that mindset and into the right mindset so that you can dominate Yeah, I feel like that extreme ownership kind of provides that too you know where if Like how you've always said if you're like blaming them overtly blaming them they're like yeah, that it kind of makes sense like it is one of those all and nothing things, you know where extreme won't He can it's just funny how you put it, you know where you're like I did my extreme ownership There's enough to you guys gonna think you can't really do that and this question is is is a really good question but When one of us would start getting a little off the reservation on something like getting all addicted to some idea or something The other one we would would be looking like I'd be telling like we need to do this and this is bullshit We need to do and he'd look at me like maybe I took come back come back come back to like We're over here. I don't necessarily want to quote unquote win because if you cheat it's not really winning You know the whole benefit of winning is like overcoming certain things, you know, but when you cheat it's like you're not running and you cheat it you know and you can all excited yeah kind of so variable reward it's like when you it's like the really the iconic cases any like Facebook or whatever you see the one the alert I go like it's something I don't know what it is it could be someone talking good about me and you can in this case, you know step back and and and get a grip on things that you know according to question that cause friction right if As if as an i and j t you are supposedly To demanding and these are little quotes at that if you're too demanding or not open to other people or not open to other ideas Here's what you do real simple Get less demanding Right if you have a hard time Listening to other people Listen to other people If you and this is another quote I got from the i and j t personality matrix and I always like say this just to my friends whatever the different like feeling a certain way I don't think you should have too much guilt in feeling a certain way like you know sometimes will be like That's it and then now every time she acted up She wouldn't like try to curb her behavior she'll act up and be like that's just my whatever my Aspergers or whatever that she like embraced it still behaved you know in whatever way she felt like behaving and then just kind of put it on the Aspergers. So that's what this guy did with the roofing company hand-mintake ownership of all the mistakes Now the problem there is With the the concept of extreme ownership it means taking Ownership of the mistakes taking ownership of the problems But it doesn't stop there That is simply where you start because the real true ownership that you need to take is you need to take extreme ownership of the solutions of Implementing the solutions of creating and implementing the solutions that's what you need to take ownership of so in a situation like this like for instance Oh, I took ownership everything so my team became entitled Now now first of all in in that statement in its own right Because if you're laxed as a goal and entitled around me that means I'm doing something wrong I mean you don't understand the mission you don't understand why we're doing what we're doing You don't understand why it's important to meet the deadline on this roof so we can move on to another one So that we can collect money to pay for our next one There's all kinds of reasons that you could tell people why these things are important and if you have people that you they know Exactly why they're doing what they're doing and they still aren't getting in the game You need to find some more people to come and work for you some different people some people with better Attitude and bring them on board with the right attitude. you're damn right of entitled because look at what I've been doing I've been no where as if I if I take a different approach with you and say Man look I think you got a lot of potential you know I think you got a lot of know you got a lot of things going on at home Especially when you're training, like when I'm trying to get stronger at like chokes and you want to be, if you have some fight in you, you know, you want to be able to, to fight, you know, so you push it a lot of times. you know what that's like it's like one a two year old says like a word or like a one and a half year old says a word and they go Sometimes you do this where they'd be lifting weights and you can see a lot of times in these like like a 24-hour fitness situation where You'll be lift Guys will be lifting weights and then one guy will He's what they're saying he's lifting kind of a lot You'll see someone all of a sudden be doing that same exercise like trying to lift more than that he doesn't know him but that's life the Jill Ireland she's she died as well I don't know who's I don't know why don't know who's left the Bronson family I don't know maybe we could that be a good way to get in contact with them start producing their shirts and get sued by them and I know we did kind of how I think we do it naturally too because I know this I'm put it really in big use because I don't call anyone out, but that I know this family where The little girls growing up they're like They kept telling her I didn't know it came off like that whether it's true or not whatever it's kind of like so when you listen to it you're like way more in tune now this might be a backhanded compliment or not I'm not sure but when you say something cool on the podcast everybody loves it everyone goes nuts you're real Whatever xyz, you know you and that feel like Because people said that to me that's what I like about you you're real whatever, you know but you know what I think you got some potential here Let me show you what it's gonna lead you know I know you don't want to be carrying shingles for extra life and on your knees smack and nails I don't want that victory don't want it So that it's like they want a some people want to look like they won and other people want to really win. yeah bear call that's wrong Bear crawl snow joke, but I think jocky up is because you wear your jocks start when you get in the game Like a juxtap joke, you know, maybe one of the old UDG guys that listens to podcast will contact me and let me know where Jock up came from. Yeah, usually that kind of person who Like you well the two kinds of people on who who is down to like screw someone over or basically cheat you're cheating is what you're doing it's like I want to be here. sometimes even when people you know like um a lot of times K the podcast comes out the next day a lot of a lot of slun Twitter are bringing up stuff you know that you said or what I said whatever It's like they don't want to win I was like you get case and point when I remember when when I was going to see all training There was people there was guys that would like brag about it so you know a lot of times you know you know the meaning you know if you listen to this but I'm gonna say Hey Hey, what you did there really work well or you know, hey, you could jump on that I didn't know I did cut I never could have figured that out like you did right When you're dealing with people, people like people's personalities, people have a personality that they, that's how they deal with things, and they get people they funnel people into their world. Because sometimes people just ask me, you know, just a question that you could Google faster, that asked me about a, you know, just some quote, not one of my quotes, but a Shakespeare quote or a book or a military unit, you know, man, Google that don't ask me. but you click on the k go to website talk about cast.com or jockel store.com click on the Amazon link before you do your shopping it'll take you you know to the Amazon save that save the resulting links in like a bookmarks is a favorite bookmark so you can support every time you shop then cost you nothing that initial three seconds of your life you know a lot of people been doing that and therefore I'm not gonna change no wrong answer if we all just accepted who we are You know, you're you're not gonna make any progress, you know, so you find some weaknesses in your personality and you fix them That's That's what I'm saying adapt yourself evolve get better stop creating fiction friction stop Creating division be humble listen take input all those things So sometimes, especially like, let's say, if you're older or even if you're a girl and you go in and you're the only girl and some people, like, let's say the guy doesn't know any better. So when you're like hey, I'm this therefore it gives me a past a Behave this way it's like dang bro you can't do that man and if you're intuitive but I shouldn't you kind of know I guess I would think I would hope yeah that's jacked up I mean actually I asked you long time ago when it was just like a theory like an idea and you were like pull over and then it was like you're going all the way I don't even know how many times we did it one guy was like Crot was crying so you pissed up What ever did it face up crying grown men crying? But Life isn't fair That's that's the reality and disease Like cancer and MS and horrible diseases and accidents and these things a good person in the wrong place in the wrong time can end up just a victim of of of of fate and end of reality and it can be horrible and heart wrenching but when those bad things happen to people around you what are you going to do How are you going to lead?
