00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 224 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.000
echo. Good evening. There is seldom a Mexican standoff in battle. You either win or lose.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.32
And in many fights a commander reaches a point where he thinks he's lost. He sees only

4
00:00:25.32 --> 00:00:31.64
his losses and knows only his own situation, not the enemies. The carnage surrounding

5
00:00:31.64 --> 00:00:40.88
him erodes his confidence. Wellington at Waterloo fought he lost. So did easy company in the

6
00:00:40.88 --> 00:00:50.24
fight on the hill up north under Desoderio. Grant summed up the feeling best at Fort Donaldson

7
00:00:50.24 --> 00:00:56.48
during the Civil War. He said either side was ready to give way if the other showed a bold

8
00:00:56.48 --> 00:01:05.48
front. Well, we'd certainly shown a bold front, but so had the men from China. Neary appeared

9
00:01:05.48 --> 00:01:11.28
again. This time carrying a little unconscious, Chinamen. I found out later that after

10
00:01:11.28 --> 00:01:16.44
I told him we needed a prisoner, he'd taken it as a personal assignment. He charged up the

11
00:01:16.44 --> 00:01:23.48
hill and stormed the top unarmed. Once in the enemy position, he'd smashed this chink

12
00:01:23.48 --> 00:01:30.76
on the head with his fist and hot-footed it back to me. Unfortunately, the POW died before

13
00:01:30.76 --> 00:01:36.40
we got the skinny. He kept trying to pull one of the grenades off Neary's belt on the way

14
00:01:36.40 --> 00:01:42.76
back and Neary had stomped him obviously a little too hard. So we got another prisoner,

15
00:01:42.76 --> 00:01:50.16
but then just when we needed him most, our interpreter, Kim, decided to bug out. Speed,

16
00:01:50.16 --> 00:01:56.44
saw him running down the hill. He stopped him. I go. I go, said Kim, and edge the way.

17
00:01:56.44 --> 00:02:02.44
Jack didn't know what to do. He was good and ready to waste him. Instead, he leveled his

18
00:02:02.44 --> 00:02:10.72
weapon and shot off Kim's hand. This persuasive little tactic or, and we bandaged up his

19
00:02:10.72 --> 00:02:16.60
hand and Kim decided he liked our company after all. The word from the POW was just what

20
00:02:16.60 --> 00:02:23.80
we wanted to hear. Our artillery had clobbered the enemy reinforcing unit and no one on the

21
00:02:23.80 --> 00:02:30.68
hill had any fight left in him. I told Jim and the others, Jimmy and the others to round

22
00:02:30.68 --> 00:02:41.80
up every gun that could walk, limp or crawl. We were going to storm the top. Twenty,

23
00:02:41.80 --> 00:02:47.48
bloodied and battered raiders soon crested the hill. It surfaced was covered with enemy

24
00:02:47.48 --> 00:02:54.84
dead. The Chinese defenders who hadn't been killed on position had chanced running the

25
00:02:54.84 --> 00:03:00.28
gauntlet of military shot, which continued to blast the backside of the hill, judging from

26
00:03:00.28 --> 00:03:08.84
the carnage on the reverse slope, few had made it. But an intact, brain gun crew was still

27
00:03:08.84 --> 00:03:16.36
raising hell among our tired band. There were more casualties until Jimmy and Evans went

28
00:03:16.36 --> 00:03:28.12
on the attack. They killed the crew, but paid the price. Jimmy lay like a broken breed next

29
00:03:28.12 --> 00:03:37.08
to the gun. He taken a shot in the face that rip through his right eye and lower jaw.

30
00:03:37.08 --> 00:03:44.44
Evans lay nearby staring at Jimmy with wide, lifeless eyes and a satisfied look on his

31
00:03:44.44 --> 00:03:54.24
heavily mustacheed face. It was the look of a winner. He probably just said to Jimmy,

32
00:03:54.24 --> 00:04:01.12
we got the son of a bitch before a burst of enemy fire. Most likely the last of the fight.

33
00:04:01.12 --> 00:04:08.84
He didn't fullen the chest and rip the life out of him.

34
00:04:08.84 --> 00:04:17.84
Neri switched on as radio to report the capture of Hill 400. Relief was en route. He was told

35
00:04:17.84 --> 00:04:26.80
dispatched by a worried kernel Sloan when we went off the air.

36
00:04:26.80 --> 00:04:34.000
O Sake, can you see? I thought, as in the dull light of the morning we collected our scattered

37
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.44
and broken fighters from the blood soaked American held hill. The inexhaustible

38
00:04:41.44 --> 00:04:52.56
breakman was kneeling over Jimmy pumping life into him with a container of albumin.

39
00:04:52.56 --> 00:05:03.12
We had seven killed in action. 29 wounded in action and one radar Salazar was missing.

40
00:05:03.12 --> 00:05:11.52
The only two raiders who were not hit were Lipka and sovereign. The two gunners. Then machine guns

41
00:05:11.52 --> 00:05:18.56
had been out of range of the frags that had depleted our ranks. It was a strange turn about.

42
00:05:18.56 --> 00:05:26.80
Normally the gunners ride in the death seat. We turned the hill over to the relieving

43
00:05:26.80 --> 00:05:33.36
wolf-hound unit and continued looking for Salazar. We wouldn't leave the hill without him.

44
00:05:33.36 --> 00:05:39.44
At any man who could walk, joined in the search. He'd been patched up after he and Smith had

45
00:05:39.44 --> 00:05:43.04
knocked out the machine gun but no one had seen him since he'd returned to the fight.

46
00:05:45.04 --> 00:05:52.64
A faint moan was heard in a draw. On the steep left hand side of 400,

47
00:05:52.64 --> 00:06:00.64
he was Salazar. More dead than alive. He'd been blown off the hill by a grenade and

48
00:06:00.64 --> 00:06:07.92
somehow with 29 slugs or shrapnel wounds in his body. That tough text in the humbry was still

49
00:06:07.92 --> 00:06:15.44
sucking air. The dock got some blood into him and we started down the hill.

50
00:06:15.44 --> 00:06:23.04
We carried all our dead and the wounded who could not make it under their own steam.

51
00:06:26.48 --> 00:06:33.44
Chink 82 millimeter and 120 millimeter mortar fire continued to smash in around us but it

52
00:06:33.44 --> 00:06:46.08
was ignored by all. After what we'd been through, it didn't mean a thing. Colonel Sloan had

53
00:06:46.08 --> 00:06:54.24
walked alone to meet us on hill 400's forward slopes. He too ignored the incoming as he went

54
00:06:54.24 --> 00:07:03.60
from radar to radar helping, comforting, praising. Tears stream from his eyes and that early

55
00:07:03.60 --> 00:07:11.60
morning light as he helped us down. He led us to the aid station and there I saw seven figures

56
00:07:11.60 --> 00:07:21.36
all lined up each covered with a poncho. It's just a nightmare I fought.

57
00:07:21.36 --> 00:07:33.28
But I didn't believe myself at all. I went to each body and pulled the sheep back off the face.

58
00:07:36.40 --> 00:07:43.20
One by one I cradled those men and rocked them in my arms, crying and mumbling and damning

59
00:07:43.20 --> 00:07:55.28
God because he had let me down. Now that curtain had fallen. The shock of it all came on.

60
00:07:57.84 --> 00:08:04.24
Suddenly I felt empty. Every part of me ached. My mouth was dry as a beach full of sand.

61
00:08:04.24 --> 00:08:13.92
Sloan helped me to my feet. He was a fine caring man and a great commander.

62
00:08:17.04 --> 00:08:21.68
The medic came up, looked at my wounds and hit me with another threat of morphine.

63
00:08:21.68 --> 00:08:31.44
It dulled the pain but not enough. He told me to go lie down in a litter so I could be evacuated.

64
00:08:34.56 --> 00:08:43.44
But I was not about to go anywhere. The welfare of my men was not a responsibility that could be delegated

65
00:08:43.44 --> 00:08:51.04
until everyone had been cared for. I'd stay right here.

66
00:09:00.80 --> 00:09:12.16
And that right there was an excerpt from the book about face. By Colonel David Hackworth is

67
00:09:12.16 --> 00:09:16.24
actually the first book that I covered on this podcast and it's the book where

68
00:09:18.72 --> 00:09:27.28
so many of the principles that I talk about and that I utilize in leadership and life stem from.

69
00:09:31.52 --> 00:09:35.20
Like the fact that the welfare of your men is something that cannot be delegated.

70
00:09:35.20 --> 00:09:55.20
Or the fact that it was okay or at least normal to cry and mumble and curse God in my petty anger.

71
00:09:55.20 --> 00:10:09.44
The fact that this kind of uncontrolled emotion didn't make me a lesser man.

72
00:10:09.44 --> 00:10:21.84
And that to lose your men, your comrades, your friends is raw pain.

73
00:10:21.84 --> 00:10:37.60
And I learned that from the book about face. I actually should say that it solidified

74
00:10:40.64 --> 00:10:44.24
in my brain. And when you read something,

75
00:10:44.24 --> 00:10:55.84
if you do it right, if you read it right, you take what you read and you overlay it with

76
00:10:55.84 --> 00:11:01.52
what you know and you make that experience and that knowledge from what you read part of your own.

77
00:11:01.52 --> 00:11:22.88
And you know when I read when I read books on this podcast, sometimes I get

78
00:11:22.88 --> 00:11:36.08
hit with some emotions. And I've always managed for the most part to keep it together.

79
00:11:40.56 --> 00:11:49.28
But the emotions that I feel, they're not directly from what is going on in the book.

80
00:11:49.28 --> 00:11:57.28
I mean, obviously that's part of it, but it's not the story from the book. It's the memories that I have.

81
00:12:04.56 --> 00:12:06.16
Because as I read, I remember.

82
00:12:06.16 --> 00:12:19.04
And I find myself there again feeling that pain and that loss.

83
00:12:24.08 --> 00:12:30.48
And there's a thread of human emotion that runs from whatever story I'm reading into my own story.

84
00:12:30.48 --> 00:12:41.52
There's a connection. And if you trace that thread, then you can learn from it. And I learn from it.

85
00:12:47.60 --> 00:12:53.52
That's what happens when you read and you'll be a story correctly when you connect

86
00:12:53.52 --> 00:13:01.12
the thread of history with your own experience and your own knowledge and you make that connection.

87
00:13:01.12 --> 00:13:07.36
And when you do that, you learn and you also begin to understand more.

88
00:13:12.64 --> 00:13:20.64
Now after a short time after we started making this podcast,

89
00:13:20.64 --> 00:13:30.16
someone sent me a message on social media. And at this point, it was pretty easy to respond and

90
00:13:30.16 --> 00:13:35.60
actually follow up and take action on things that people were saying to me because it wasn't a bunch of them.

91
00:13:35.60 --> 00:13:38.40
And somebody just sent me a message on social media and said,

92
00:13:40.24 --> 00:13:42.96
said, there's a podcast called Margar Made. You will like it.

93
00:13:42.96 --> 00:13:54.88
So I some point pulled out this podcast called Margar Made and I listened and as I listened to that voice,

94
00:13:57.12 --> 00:14:03.76
I heard that voice making these connections, connections between the past and present,

95
00:14:03.76 --> 00:14:14.64
connections between the emotions of people from the past and our emotions right now.

96
00:14:13.84 --> 00:14:22.08
A voice that connected the emotions from from soldiers and citizens and terrorists and patriots and

97
00:14:22.08 --> 00:14:36.24
mortars and mortars. The voice connected those things and the voice understood,

98
00:14:39.28 --> 00:14:46.88
understood something and that voice read and then spoke and tied those threads together

99
00:14:46.88 --> 00:14:58.08
and that voice came from someone named Darrell Cooper who is the voice and the mind and

100
00:14:58.96 --> 00:15:09.44
the emotion behind the podcast Margar Made. And I guess through the benefit of the interwebs,

101
00:15:09.44 --> 00:15:27.28
we eventually connected and Darrell just has a very good handle on wrapping these connections together

102
00:15:28.72 --> 00:15:32.56
and he's here tonight to talk with us about those connections.

103
00:15:32.56 --> 00:15:45.04
The story of what his life has been and then the thread connects him and us to the past and the present

104
00:15:45.04 --> 00:15:52.64
and the future. Darrell, thanks for coming on, man. Thanks for having me.

105
00:15:52.64 --> 00:16:02.56
So yeah, I remember somebody hitting me up and saying you got to check out this podcast and

106
00:16:03.44 --> 00:16:09.92
you're opening for podcast one episode one of Margar Made. I said, oh yeah,

107
00:16:10.96 --> 00:16:17.04
here it is. This guy who ever told me to listen to this was right and you actually put out that podcast.

108
00:16:17.04 --> 00:16:27.92
What was it early 2015? That sounds right. Yeah, I can't remember. I know it was before I started my podcast.

109
00:16:27.92 --> 00:16:31.12
I know that because I looked at it the other day to try and figure it out.

110
00:16:34.16 --> 00:16:39.84
And then when I found out and the more I found out about you and kind of your background and your back story,

111
00:16:39.84 --> 00:16:49.44
it's pretty fascinating in my opinion. Let's go into it, man. Let's start, let's start at the

112
00:16:49.44 --> 00:16:54.16
beginning of your life. How did start? Where'd you come from?

113
00:16:56.16 --> 00:17:02.16
I came from all over. I was born in Stockton, California. Stockton 209.

114
00:17:03.52 --> 00:17:09.28
Right on. But I lived all over the place. I probably went to my track count and I'm up

115
00:17:09.28 --> 00:17:14.56
every once in a while, but there's kind of gaps in my memory. I went to maybe 35, 36, 37,

116
00:17:14.56 --> 00:17:21.36
schools, K through 12. So we were moving around all the time. I had a single mother.

117
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.52
We was taking care of us and we kind of had scraped and scrounge and you know, live where we could.

118
00:17:27.52 --> 00:17:33.36
And at the end of the day, we always had food on the table. We always had, you know, a roof over

119
00:17:33.36 --> 00:17:39.60
our heads for the most part, took care of us. But, you know, there were some close shapes there,

120
00:17:39.60 --> 00:17:46.16
various times and we had to kind of bounce around wherever we could. So I've lived all over California

121
00:17:46.16 --> 00:17:50.40
from the south all the way up to Eureka for a little while. I don't really remember much about that,

122
00:17:50.40 --> 00:17:56.56
but a lot of times Stockton, I think I went to every school in Stockton at one point in my life.

123
00:17:56.56 --> 00:18:00.08
I think I went to 11 different high school there for years.

124
00:18:00.08 --> 00:18:03.44
People are like, what's causing you to go from one high school to another high school?

125
00:18:04.24 --> 00:18:11.04
Just, you know, we were poor. We kind of had to move wherever we could find a spot sometimes.

126
00:18:11.04 --> 00:18:16.64
Sometimes that meant moving in with relatives, other times that meant, you know,

127
00:18:16.64 --> 00:18:20.88
friends of my mom, sometimes it meant getting formed out to various relatives,

128
00:18:20.88 --> 00:18:25.28
one of my mom kind of went on a row and little oddities for a while and had to look after herself.

129
00:18:25.28 --> 00:18:29.84
And so just bouncing around. I lived up in Montana for a little while when I was in high school.

130
00:18:29.84 --> 00:18:34.24
I actually ended up graduating when I was up there. And that was a good experience. I kind of,

131
00:18:34.24 --> 00:18:38.48
you know, I was one of those kids who is a lot of people like this. And I think a lot of folks who are

132
00:18:38.48 --> 00:18:42.96
comfortable in middle class don't really, don't really even understand this. You see it down in LA.

133
00:18:44.16 --> 00:18:46.48
There's a lot of kids who live in South LA, for example.

134
00:18:47.76 --> 00:18:53.04
There may be 20 minute drive for the beach. They may have seen it once in their life.

135
00:18:53.84 --> 00:18:57.92
And that's kind of, that's kind of how we were. You get confined your little neighborhoods,

136
00:18:57.92 --> 00:19:01.20
you know, and you get on your bikes and ride around, you know, like latch key kids,

137
00:19:01.20 --> 00:19:06.40
but your world's very, very small. And so growing up in kind of, you know, a lot of the

138
00:19:06.40 --> 00:19:11.20
rough neighborhoods of places like Stockton and Central Valley, Bakersfield, different places,

139
00:19:11.92 --> 00:19:16.16
actually being able to get out and go spend some time on Montana when I was in high school.

140
00:19:16.16 --> 00:19:20.88
It was pretty life changing for me. I got to, and kind of being a lifestyle around

141
00:19:21.92 --> 00:19:25.92
kind of people in a high trust society that I had never been around before.

142
00:19:25.92 --> 00:19:30.08
You know, I'd never been in a place where people don't worry about lock in their

143
00:19:30.08 --> 00:19:35.44
car doors or where it's normal on a two lane street when people are passing each other to wave,

144
00:19:35.44 --> 00:19:41.92
to one another. I just never seen that before. And it kind of opened up, you know, when you come,

145
00:19:41.92 --> 00:19:47.60
when you come from a certain world where social connections are very tenuous,

146
00:19:48.88 --> 00:19:54.56
social trust is kind of low to be around a place like that where people are generally looking

147
00:19:54.56 --> 00:19:59.84
after each other. So obviously, crying, there's things that happen, but generally people are kind

148
00:19:59.84 --> 00:20:03.60
of looking after each other. You know, there's a different kind of life out there. So it was very

149
00:20:03.60 --> 00:20:09.84
good for me. How did you get up to Montana? What was the situation that allowed that to happen?

150
00:20:09.84 --> 00:20:14.80
My grandparents moved up there at one point. I was probably in maybe late middle school when

151
00:20:14.80 --> 00:20:19.36
they moved up there. And then at some point in high school, we would visit them for the summer,

152
00:20:19.92 --> 00:20:23.44
and we would always really enjoy it. They had about 38 acres up there, a little farm.

153
00:20:23.44 --> 00:20:29.92
And then at one point, things were getting pretty hairy at home. And so we ended up going up,

154
00:20:29.92 --> 00:20:34.96
the kids, me and my sister, we ended up going up there and staying for a year, year and a half,

155
00:20:34.96 --> 00:20:40.64
before my mom ended up coming as well. And what, how many sisters do you have?

156
00:20:41.52 --> 00:20:51.28
I had three, I'd rather two at the time. So I was up in Montana, I was probably like 10 years ago,

157
00:20:51.28 --> 00:20:57.04
maybe eight years ago, and it was in the summertime. And I was driving out of Bozeman through

158
00:20:57.04 --> 00:21:02.64
Big Sky, and I was driving back to California. And it was, it was the summertime. And I wanted my

159
00:21:02.64 --> 00:21:09.04
kids to like sleep on the whole way home. So I left it probably seven o'clock at night. But it was

160
00:21:09.04 --> 00:21:15.60
the summertime. So it stayed light until about nine. So I did the full drive down the, what is it?

161
00:21:15.60 --> 00:21:24.48
The one 91. I did the full drive down the 91, which is just absolutely like, it's epically

162
00:21:24.48 --> 00:21:31.60
beautiful. Just beyond, it's just epic. And now my kids are falling asleep. So just me, you know,

163
00:21:31.60 --> 00:21:39.92
listening to Black Sabbath or something, and just amazed. And then by the time I'm making it to

164
00:21:39.92 --> 00:21:47.52
wherever I'd have or something, and you start getting into the more open terrain, it was dark.

165
00:21:47.52 --> 00:21:53.92
And then I drove through the night. And as the sun started to come up, I was in San Beredu.

166
00:21:54.80 --> 00:21:59.20
And I remember, and you know, there's parts of the, what is it? Parts of the 15 or the

167
00:21:59.20 --> 00:22:04.16
215 through San Beredu, do you know that turn into like a two lane? It's not like a big highway.

168
00:22:04.16 --> 00:22:11.60
And there's always traffic. And so I came from this just absolutely open mountainous, you know,

169
00:22:11.60 --> 00:22:18.56
snow covered hills, which there's snow covered hills in the summertime, pine trees, animals everywhere.

170
00:22:18.56 --> 00:22:24.88
And then the next thing you know, I'm in San Beredu, you know. And you know, it's just a totally

171
00:22:24.88 --> 00:22:30.48
different world, you know. And when you were talking about the different world that you live in,

172
00:22:30.48 --> 00:22:34.32
you know, and I grew up in a tiny New England town on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. And you

173
00:22:34.32 --> 00:22:40.40
kind of think that that's what the world is. But yeah, kids, and I think it's probably less like this

174
00:22:40.40 --> 00:22:45.92
now because you can see so much of the world through the internet and through media and through movies.

175
00:22:46.72 --> 00:22:53.12
But yeah, it was kind of like that was your world. So that must have been a serious

176
00:22:53.12 --> 00:23:01.44
eye opener for you to get to go from, you know, central California to freaking Montana.

177
00:23:01.44 --> 00:23:08.48
It was. Yeah, and socially, especially socially, you know, coming from middle schools in high

178
00:23:08.48 --> 00:23:15.92
schools where, you know, on one hand, something like a fight on campus was taken very seriously.

179
00:23:15.92 --> 00:23:21.76
There are armed cops on campus, right? Coming from a high school that had almost 5,000 kids, a

180
00:23:21.76 --> 00:23:28.72
subway and a pizza hut, you know, on on campus and going to, you know, a school up in Montana where

181
00:23:28.72 --> 00:23:37.12
my graduating class had about, I think, 40 people. And, you know, in a weird way, a fight was not

182
00:23:37.12 --> 00:23:41.36
as big of a deal up there. The counselors and teachers would literally tell to of us to take it

183
00:23:41.36 --> 00:23:46.08
outside. But there was no threat that this was going to escalate into some of the normal

184
00:23:46.08 --> 00:23:52.16
kids getting shanked. Right. It wasn't even in anybody's mindset that that was a possibility.

185
00:23:52.16 --> 00:23:57.60
And so it was like, it was like going back a few decades, you know, in a way. And they still call

186
00:23:57.60 --> 00:24:03.04
soda pop up there. Well, there's parts of the country where that's just what that's just how.

187
00:24:03.04 --> 00:24:08.80
I still, I just can't help it. It's like buddy Holly, like 1950s. But it was, you know, there's

188
00:24:08.80 --> 00:24:14.56
a lot of things that it feels like going back a few decades, which in a ways it kind of

189
00:24:14.56 --> 00:24:20.08
a sad way to look at it because the things that are different up there are really that there

190
00:24:20.08 --> 00:24:25.28
are certain elements of civic society, you know, social trust and things that they take for

191
00:24:25.28 --> 00:24:29.44
granted that we don't take for granted the cities on the coast for the most part anymore. And

192
00:24:29.44 --> 00:24:34.08
so to say that it's like going back a few decades, you know, it's kind of admitting that we've

193
00:24:34.08 --> 00:24:37.84
lost a little something down here and that, you know, maybe there's something that's going

194
00:24:37.84 --> 00:24:41.52
to be encroaching, you know, on the areas that still have, you don't like to think of it that

195
00:24:41.52 --> 00:24:46.40
way, but it's out of felt. So when you were going from high school, how many high schools did you

196
00:24:46.40 --> 00:24:50.40
say you went to? I think 11, a couple of them, I went to more than once, so I would change and then

197
00:24:50.40 --> 00:24:53.92
come back to another school. So, so how did you who you're hanging around with?

198
00:24:55.04 --> 00:25:00.72
You know, it would depend. So, when I would find with the school in Montana that I was at,

199
00:25:00.72 --> 00:25:05.52
I had like a little group of friends that we would hang out with. We go, you know, one of them,

200
00:25:05.52 --> 00:25:09.60
their parents had a ranch with a bunch of land and we go out there and play paint bulbs. It was a

201
00:25:09.60 --> 00:25:13.52
great time. And I had a good group of friends up there. A lot of the times when I was at my

202
00:25:13.52 --> 00:25:19.68
schools in California, the big ones, you just get lost in, I would not really, I wouldn't hang out

203
00:25:19.68 --> 00:25:24.72
with anybody. I would be the kid, you know, in between classes. I've got my nose in a book and

204
00:25:24.72 --> 00:25:29.44
lunch period, I would go throw some shorts and shirts on and go run laps or run stairs in the

205
00:25:29.44 --> 00:25:33.84
in the football stadium or something just kind of by myself. Did you play any sports? Often on,

206
00:25:34.56 --> 00:25:39.04
and I got to be a pretty decent wrestler by the end. I played football when I could track

207
00:25:39.04 --> 00:25:43.36
cross country, whatever, you know, depends on where I was. It was hard because, you know, it's kind of

208
00:25:43.36 --> 00:25:47.76
strange as a rule that never really made sense to me and it still doesn't. But I guess they're trying to

209
00:25:47.76 --> 00:25:52.80
prevent like schools from bringing in ringers and stuff. But if you get into a school, there's

210
00:25:52.80 --> 00:25:56.48
like you have to have been there for a certain period of time before they allow you to participate

211
00:25:56.48 --> 00:26:01.68
in sports and a lot of times I was changing schools every three months. You just wouldn't make the window.

212
00:26:01.68 --> 00:26:09.60
Yeah. So you, like you say you were reading. Yeah. At what point did you figure out, you're going

213
00:26:09.60 --> 00:26:15.76
to start reading books? Because I don't think I figured that until I was 28, you know, you couldn't

214
00:26:15.76 --> 00:26:20.80
get me to read a book. I mean, when I was going through high school, you, that was like a crazy idea

215
00:26:20.80 --> 00:26:27.68
to me. It's actually fallen terribly sit down and read a book. It would be tough for me to figure

216
00:26:27.68 --> 00:26:31.52
out when that started. It's as long as I can remember though. When I was five, six, seven years old,

217
00:26:31.52 --> 00:26:39.60
I got to the point where if you stuck me in, you know, if I was in a dentist waiting room and he had

218
00:26:39.60 --> 00:26:46.88
an old issue of good housekeeping, I'm reading the whole thing. As long as I'm in there, I read

219
00:26:46.88 --> 00:26:51.84
dictionaries. I read in psyched the P, I would read anything that I could find around. It's kind of

220
00:26:51.84 --> 00:26:56.56
missed that actually. Like now with the internet, you never read anything random. You go find something

221
00:26:56.56 --> 00:27:00.56
that you want to read about and you click on a link and you go to the next thing. I would just read

222
00:27:00.56 --> 00:27:04.40
whatever there happened to be around. I would literally read the dictionary if that was what was there.

223
00:27:04.40 --> 00:27:13.60
It was a refuge for me. You know, in a life where instability was probably the defining feature,

224
00:27:13.60 --> 00:27:19.04
you know, and I was growing up. Just gave you these, you know, I could, I could be reading a series of

225
00:27:19.04 --> 00:27:25.76
books and something I could take with me from this school, to the next school, and kind of stay in

226
00:27:25.76 --> 00:27:33.52
that world. And yeah, it really was a refuge and it, you know, the books I would read was that's

227
00:27:33.52 --> 00:27:38.16
where I would get a lot of my sort of models for behavior. Everybody does that to a certain degree.

228
00:27:38.16 --> 00:27:42.88
You know, they model themselves on their favorite heroes or whatever, but coming from a place where

229
00:27:42.88 --> 00:27:48.32
I didn't have a whole lot of role models around, especially not for any period of time.

230
00:27:49.76 --> 00:27:54.08
They really took the place, you know, of my real life role models and kind of taught me how to

231
00:27:54.08 --> 00:27:59.60
behave in a lot of ways and kind of taught me the virtues and values that you should have, that I should

232
00:27:59.60 --> 00:28:05.04
aspire to because I didn't have a lot of models for those things. And some ways it becomes, you know,

233
00:28:05.04 --> 00:28:08.88
you can, you can get pathological about that. You can get to the point where you're so sucked into

234
00:28:08.88 --> 00:28:14.64
these fictional worlds that, you know, I have friends, a lot of people, it seems like mostly women,

235
00:28:14.64 --> 00:28:20.24
but I meant to who they can tell you how many, they can tell you what flavor of birthday cake they

236
00:28:20.24 --> 00:28:26.96
had on their seventh birthday and what they got as presents. And I don't remember anything from like

237
00:28:28.24 --> 00:28:33.04
10 years ago. And it's just, you know, most of the time throughout, you know, my whole life and this

238
00:28:33.04 --> 00:28:37.52
is still a, you know, I have like a little bit of a doctor do a little kind of thing going where

239
00:28:37.52 --> 00:28:43.52
or Mr. McGoo rather, where, you know, I'm always up in my head, you know, I'm always thinking about

240
00:28:43.52 --> 00:28:48.48
whatever book I just read or, you know, whatever book I'm about to read and so I'm always kind of

241
00:28:48.48 --> 00:28:52.96
up here and a lot of times I'm missing things that are going on around me. And so you try to ask me

242
00:28:52.96 --> 00:28:56.96
about things that happened last week or let alone years and years ago, there's whole patches of my

243
00:28:56.96 --> 00:29:02.40
childhood that are just totally inaccessible. You know, I'm not even things where, you know,

244
00:29:02.40 --> 00:29:06.16
somebody could be like, you know, that time and they jog your memory, it's just, I was not present

245
00:29:06.16 --> 00:29:11.28
at the time. You know, my nose was in a book or that's what I was thinking of. And so I really kind of,

246
00:29:12.56 --> 00:29:17.60
kind of, you kind of use that as a refuge. Did you, you know, you said you're in a single mom,

247
00:29:17.60 --> 00:29:24.64
what was going on with your father at this point? You know, so my father was gone out of the picture

248
00:29:24.64 --> 00:29:29.76
permanently by the time I was two. He was, my mom was 16 years old when she came pregnant with me.

249
00:29:30.88 --> 00:29:40.000
I mean when she was 17 and my father was a criminal and a drug addict and a violent guy and

250
00:29:40.64 --> 00:29:45.36
came from a violent family, you know, and he was in jail for the final time that I ever saw

251
00:29:45.36 --> 00:29:50.16
when I was two years old. I have a couple like very, very brief kind of flashes of memories that

252
00:29:50.16 --> 00:29:56.80
I'm told, for him, but I don't remember what he looks like or anything like that. And yeah,

253
00:29:56.80 --> 00:30:02.16
so he was gone by the time I was two. Right about that point right before he left my mom with

254
00:30:02.16 --> 00:30:07.68
my sister. So she was pregnant when he went to the clinic and, you know, at that point my mom's

255
00:30:07.68 --> 00:30:17.52
19 years old, two of us so far, two kids, dads out of the picture for the last time. You know,

256
00:30:17.52 --> 00:30:24.56
she's got a tenth grade education. Any person did she wear her parents around? You know, my family's

257
00:30:24.56 --> 00:30:33.76
kind of, it's one of those, I think it's a good American story, right? There's various strains of immigrants,

258
00:30:33.76 --> 00:30:39.28
you know, my great grandmother came from Serbia and like 1906 or something like that. My great

259
00:30:39.28 --> 00:30:45.12
grandfather, her husband came up from Mexico. You know, these two people from these completely opposite

260
00:30:45.12 --> 00:30:49.28
live styles and sides of the world somehow find each other, but they're both coming from, you know,

261
00:30:49.28 --> 00:30:53.84
my great grandfather was a minor. You know, he would, his family would be in California and he's

262
00:30:53.84 --> 00:30:59.68
going off to Nevada, Arizona and working in silver mines and stuff. Just breaking his back to

263
00:30:59.68 --> 00:31:05.12
provide just enough for his family to get by. It was a hard life. My father's son, you know,

264
00:31:05.12 --> 00:31:12.000
my father was a bad guy, a million different ways, but, you know, he, I hear, I hear horror stories about

265
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.68
where he came from. You know, he was sleeping on a park bench when he was 12 years old because his

266
00:31:15.68 --> 00:31:21.04
mom threw him out of the house. His uncle was teaching him how to shoot up when he was 13, 14 years old.

267
00:31:21.04 --> 00:31:26.96
You know, this is a, I don't hate the man at all. I never met him afterwards or anything like that,

268
00:31:26.96 --> 00:31:32.64
but I have sympathy for somebody like that. There's very, very few people, you know, discipline

269
00:31:32.64 --> 00:31:35.84
equals freedom and all those kind of things. Your uncle's teaching you to shoot up when you're 13

270
00:31:35.84 --> 00:31:41.60
years old. You're climbing up a pretty good, damn big hole, you know. And so you have like these sort of

271
00:31:42.24 --> 00:31:48.40
these, these, these family lineage that are just falling into whatever they may have been at one point

272
00:31:48.40 --> 00:31:52.72
back in the past. By the time they get up to about my grandparents generation, it's just chaos,

273
00:31:52.72 --> 00:32:01.68
right? It's just no structure, no support system, no, anything. And things had, you know, my, my

274
00:32:01.68 --> 00:32:09.52
grandfather, who was my mother and her three sisters, to all four of my hands, that's all of my mom's

275
00:32:09.52 --> 00:32:14.96
siblings. My grandfather came into the picture after they were all born and he's their stepfather.

276
00:32:14.96 --> 00:32:19.36
He's the only grandfather ever known, but he was their stepfather and he provided some stability.

277
00:32:19.36 --> 00:32:25.04
He was an avi chief. You know, he was an armed real, uh, armed real bastard at the time. He got

278
00:32:25.04 --> 00:32:32.16
to be a big soft teddy bear later on, but he did provide some stability. Um, and that was starting

279
00:32:32.16 --> 00:32:37.36
to kind of come together around the time I was born in 81, but not really, you know, was still

280
00:32:37.36 --> 00:32:42.16
like in its early stages. And so they were around, but, you know, they didn't have a whole lot of

281
00:32:42.16 --> 00:32:47.44
patients for, you know, my mom, the way she was acting out, she was already probably in the gosh.

282
00:32:47.44 --> 00:32:52.000
And her teenage years when she was having me and, and, you know, her and her friends were already

283
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.72
drinking and partying. She was probably an alcoholic by that point already. My grandparents

284
00:32:56.72 --> 00:33:00.56
didn't have a lot of patients for that kind of stuff. And so they were around sort of,

285
00:33:01.20 --> 00:33:04.40
if she wanted to shape up, but there wasn't really a support structure for,

286
00:33:05.60 --> 00:33:10.96
especially if she wasn't like prepared to kind of fully conform. And so she was really out on a

287
00:33:10.96 --> 00:33:18.80
round from a very early age, you know, with kids and no real, she's 17 years old, she got a kid,

288
00:33:18.80 --> 00:33:22.48
you know what I mean? She's by herself. And then she's 19 years old, she has two kids.

289
00:33:22.48 --> 00:33:30.88
Yeah. So when you're in school, like, are you, what, what, what, what, what, what,

290
00:33:30.88 --> 00:33:35.12
what is it, you know, you're talking about how the world looks like, you know, physically kind of

291
00:33:35.12 --> 00:33:40.24
and socially on the outside. From your mind, what did you, what did your future look like? Did

292
00:33:40.24 --> 00:33:45.12
you see, you know, are you looking at people going, oh, well, I could do this or I could do that.

293
00:33:45.12 --> 00:33:49.12
I could go to college or I could go in the military or I could, like, what were you thinking

294
00:33:49.12 --> 00:33:56.40
about day-to-day? Did you have any visions like that? Not until pretty late. No, I, you know,

295
00:33:56.40 --> 00:34:01.28
one of the things about, I think a lot, a lot of people when they look at somebody like you.

296
00:34:01.28 --> 00:34:05.28
And whether this is true or not, it's the impression they get, is that Jaco seems like this guy

297
00:34:05.28 --> 00:34:12.56
who, like, turned 18 or whatever, got out of high school and just, I know exactly what I want to do

298
00:34:12.56 --> 00:34:16.72
and now from now, this point on, like, for the rest of my life, like, I'm going to just focus on

299
00:34:16.72 --> 00:34:21.52
becoming that thing and everybody's like, God, I wish I could have, like, had something like that

300
00:34:21.52 --> 00:34:26.000
when I was, whatever age, most people go through their whole lives and they never, you know, have that

301
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.32
level of, uh, a vision of what they want to become and then being able to focus on it. And

302
00:34:32.32 --> 00:34:39.44
when you're coming up in a very unstable environment, one of the things that happens is your time

303
00:34:39.44 --> 00:34:44.56
horizon just gets shrunk down and shrunk down until, you know, you're really trying to figure

304
00:34:44.56 --> 00:34:49.84
out how to get through the next week or the next day or the next, you know, class or whatever it is

305
00:34:50.56 --> 00:34:56.32
and thinking about the future, you know, I mean, I can't remember as a kid, like, you know,

306
00:34:56.88 --> 00:35:00.88
maybe maybe I watched Jurassic Park and like, I want to go dig up dinosaur bones or something,

307
00:35:00.88 --> 00:35:04.64
but as far as like a serious vision from my life and now. Yeah, you know, I actually,

308
00:35:04.64 --> 00:35:10.64
I wanted a juggle live events that I did. I, I talked about this fact, uh, and it's just pure luck,

309
00:35:10.64 --> 00:35:17.28
right? It's pure luck that at some point, you know, you watch Jurassic Park or whatever and I watched

310
00:35:17.28 --> 00:35:22.96
a full metal jacket or I watched Platoon and at some point, uh, I watched one of those movies

311
00:35:23.76 --> 00:35:30.24
actually is probably a apocalypse now. I think that's the first, the first thing when I was, you know,

312
00:35:30.24 --> 00:35:35.68
whatever, probably, you know, eight years old or something. Apocalypse now made you want to be a soldier.

313
00:35:35.68 --> 00:35:41.60
Oh, yeah. That's just great, Junker. Yeah. But, you know, you see apocalypse now and you think, okay,

314
00:35:42.48 --> 00:35:45.52
you know, I always, you know, I was always running around playing war, I was always running around

315
00:35:45.52 --> 00:35:50.80
playing soldiers. So I had that in my brain, but the, I think when I realized, oh, yeah, you know,

316
00:35:50.80 --> 00:35:55.92
I was thinking about this the other day, there was a friend of the family who had an older son who is a

317
00:35:55.92 --> 00:36:05.60
Marine Corps drone instructor and when he came home for leave or something and he had a, uh, a Chevy,

318
00:36:06.32 --> 00:36:15.36
like SS, right, a Chival, and or, oh, oh, he had a bad ass muscle car and you know, he was a Marine

319
00:36:15.36 --> 00:36:20.24
Corps drone instructor and I was like, okay, you know, I don't know how old I was, but I wasn't old.

320
00:36:20.24 --> 00:36:25.52
And it sort of made me realize that this idea of my, in my head of running around and being,

321
00:36:25.52 --> 00:36:31.68
like, some kind of command, was a real thing that you could actually do. And then, then once I found

322
00:36:31.68 --> 00:36:37.12
on about the Seal team's cool, but my whole point in telling you all this is that, you know, you hear,

323
00:36:38.24 --> 00:36:41.84
you hear, like Jordan Peterson will talk about, you know, you got to have, if you have an aim,

324
00:36:41.84 --> 00:36:47.20
then you, then you know what you're trying to get after, right? So when I joined the Navy and like

325
00:36:47.20 --> 00:36:52.72
wanted to be a seal and then I, I wanted to be a good seal, that was my aim and you're 100%

326
00:36:52.72 --> 00:36:56.80
right, once that became my aim and once I figured out what I needed to do and the beautiful thing

327
00:36:56.80 --> 00:37:02.56
about it was in the Navy and then in the Seal teams, they told me, this is what you have to do to be good,

328
00:37:02.56 --> 00:37:06.72
to be a good seal, you do this, to be a good seal, you do that, to be a good seal, you do the other thing.

329
00:37:06.72 --> 00:37:13.44
So absolutely, I was lucky because, you know, I was a freaking, you know, crazy kid that was doing

330
00:37:13.44 --> 00:37:22.08
all kinds of really stupid, stupid things that just were not good for the world. And luckily,

331
00:37:22.08 --> 00:37:28.96
I, I signed that down in line and became, you know, went in the Navy, but so I did have that and that immediately,

332
00:37:28.96 --> 00:37:34.96
I was like, okay, and even when I was, I think my mom showed me something where I was, you know,

333
00:37:34.96 --> 00:37:38.40
like, whatever, eight years old or something and it was what do you want to do in

334
00:37:38.40 --> 00:37:44.88
you grow up and I said, like, soldier or marine, like that was good to go, right? So that was,

335
00:37:44.88 --> 00:37:49.12
whenever anybody talked to me about anything else, I was kind of like, I can't co-iron you know what I'm doing.

336
00:37:49.12 --> 00:37:56.08
So that was a real benefit and that put my whole future into context because I saw this thing that I could do.

337
00:37:56.08 --> 00:38:02.48
And as I told Johnny Kim the other day, like when I joined the Navy, I felt completely liberated

338
00:38:02.48 --> 00:38:09.36
because I knew that I was good to go for 20 years, you know, or 30 years, I was like, yep, I'm good to go.

339
00:38:09.36 --> 00:38:15.68
I've got a job, I've got a paycheck, I've got a, I've got to have friends, it's going to be cool.

340
00:38:15.68 --> 00:38:18.56
I'm going to have a mission to do like something to buy into.

341
00:38:18.56 --> 00:38:24.24
It was something to aim at with something to buy into as part of being part of like the coolest gang ever.

342
00:38:25.44 --> 00:38:29.04
So what's not like, what's not to like? I think we're a lot of people struggle.

343
00:38:29.84 --> 00:38:35.52
But there's probably two parts of it. It is one is trying to figure out what that thing is,

344
00:38:35.52 --> 00:38:39.68
you know, most people, they just, they have things that they're into and they,

345
00:38:39.68 --> 00:38:45.04
what I think what most people really long for is something that'll just present itself,

346
00:38:45.04 --> 00:38:49.36
you know, there'll be a ray of sunshine shining down on it and they'll just know,

347
00:38:49.36 --> 00:38:54.32
this is the thing that I need to devote all my energy to. And now I can, there's your aim, right?

348
00:38:54.32 --> 00:38:59.76
Now I can just devote myself to this thing fully. I think that's why people get caught up in

349
00:38:59.76 --> 00:39:05.76
movements sometimes, right? Whether it's politics, whether it's a geotist movement or whatever.

350
00:39:05.76 --> 00:39:11.12
Like whatever it is, it's something that like, here's the answer, do this, here's a clear path

351
00:39:11.12 --> 00:39:16.72
to becoming a better person, quote unquote, according to the following value system, but you know,

352
00:39:16.72 --> 00:39:23.28
how to sort of level up in this mode. And for most people that doesn't come, for most people,

353
00:39:23.28 --> 00:39:27.84
you have to kind of start trying things and really start working and then it'll unfold over time

354
00:39:27.84 --> 00:39:32.40
for you. It's not just going to present itself, you know, as easily. And then the other thing is,

355
00:39:32.96 --> 00:39:36.40
and this isn't just true of kids that came from difficult backgrounds like I did,

356
00:39:36.40 --> 00:39:43.36
it's true of more and more people where, you know, people talk about like class privilege,

357
00:39:43.36 --> 00:39:47.76
you know, your parents, most of the way that that applies is not that your parents are going to

358
00:39:47.76 --> 00:39:51.76
leave you a bunch of money. It's that you're growing up in a household where you're watching your

359
00:39:51.76 --> 00:39:57.12
dad get shit done. You're watching your mom get up in the morning and put herself together and go

360
00:39:57.12 --> 00:40:01.12
about her day and put the house together and go to go to work, whatever it is. And you're just watching

361
00:40:01.12 --> 00:40:07.04
people encounter obstacles in their life and assess, execute, you know, what our orient themselves

362
00:40:07.04 --> 00:40:13.76
and overcome the obstacle. And, you know, there's just a growing number of people who, and I certainly

363
00:40:13.76 --> 00:40:17.36
was this way, you know, growing up with a single mom who was having a very difficult time

364
00:40:18.24 --> 00:40:26.24
managing her own life in any kind of, you know, just the most basic ways. I never saw anybody

365
00:40:26.24 --> 00:40:31.52
just sort of encounter an obstacle at a point where they could see it in the distance. You know,

366
00:40:31.52 --> 00:40:37.68
everything was a panic exercise all the time. Everything got put off until the last possible moment

367
00:40:37.68 --> 00:40:41.92
and now you have to react to it because it's an emergency if you don't. Everything is an emergency

368
00:40:41.92 --> 00:40:48.40
all the time. And, you, so you don't, you don't learn how to sort of structure your,

369
00:40:49.68 --> 00:40:55.76
your your goals and how to systematically work towards them. And that's something that you have to learn,

370
00:40:55.76 --> 00:41:01.20
you know, I, I was fortunate enough that, you know, I had a couple of coaches at various times

371
00:41:01.20 --> 00:41:06.96
for brief periods, but they made enough of an impact that, you know, things got, you know, that I had a

372
00:41:06.96 --> 00:41:10.56
different way of looking at things, but even me, like I didn't start to get that until,

373
00:41:11.84 --> 00:41:16.40
until I was in the Navy, you know, probably I was 22, 23. You said you were a good restaurant,

374
00:41:16.40 --> 00:41:21.76
you were a rest of the worry. All right, decent. I mean, I could hold my own. I was a, I had a winning

375
00:41:21.76 --> 00:41:26.72
record, but I wasn't any, you know, so you didn't make it to stay. When I, like that, or did you?

376
00:41:26.72 --> 00:41:29.60
Well, I, I, I went when I was up in Montana, but those boys up there in Montana,

377
00:41:29.60 --> 00:41:34.56
so I like to sink California up in Montana. These kids all start when they're four or five years old.

378
00:41:34.56 --> 00:41:40.32
It's ridiculous. And like down here, if people start 7th or 8th grade, like they've got a huge

379
00:41:40.32 --> 00:41:44.08
jump on people because most people start ninth grade down here. It's changing a little bit now.

380
00:41:44.08 --> 00:41:50.08
It changes a lot. I do, I'm hearing a report that, yeah, the kids are getting after it. I,

381
00:41:50.08 --> 00:41:53.84
I mentioned how, you know, one of the things that happens when you're living an unstable life

382
00:41:55.52 --> 00:41:59.36
is that your time horizon just shrinks. You know, you're focused on getting through the next,

383
00:42:00.40 --> 00:42:05.20
on keeping your emotions together for the next half hour sometimes, let alone, like thinking years

384
00:42:05.20 --> 00:42:10.88
and advance about what you want to do with your life. And, you know, a lot of people kind of stay in

385
00:42:10.88 --> 00:42:16.16
that mode where they're just getting through the day, and they're doing that 365 times, and then

386
00:42:16.16 --> 00:42:20.48
that's a year, and then they do it more and more, and that's a couple years, and now they're adults,

387
00:42:21.20 --> 00:42:25.52
and they don't even feel like they've made any decisions in their lives. They feel like,

388
00:42:25.52 --> 00:42:29.68
you know, obviously everything that they've done has been a decision, but it's never felt that way.

389
00:42:29.68 --> 00:42:34.40
It's always felt like the momentum of their lives is just carrying them forward and they're reacting

390
00:42:34.40 --> 00:42:40.08
to whatever the next thing is that's demanding a reaction, but they didn't plan for that, you know,

391
00:42:40.08 --> 00:42:44.64
for that thing, it's just presenting itself upon them at a time when they're not really prepared

392
00:42:44.64 --> 00:42:49.12
for it, they haven't gotten themselves in, so they're just making a decision in the moment that

393
00:42:49.12 --> 00:42:54.40
may or may not, you know, here's actually, I should not tell this story actually. So,

394
00:42:56.56 --> 00:43:02.48
one of my first memories, I don't know what I want to talk about this, okay, so one of my first memories,

395
00:43:02.48 --> 00:43:08.80
like probably my first memory is just, my childhood occurs to me in flashes, just brief little

396
00:43:08.80 --> 00:43:14.96
flashes of images that people tell me real, and so I believe them. When I was like two years old,

397
00:43:14.96 --> 00:43:21.04
I think I was laying on a bed with my father, I must have been too or younger, because he was

398
00:43:21.04 --> 00:43:26.000
out of the picture when I was two, and he used to like to cut wedges of green apples and put a little

399
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.76
bit of salt on them and eat them, and I was eating these with them, and we were watching a TV that

400
00:43:29.76 --> 00:43:34.32
was like, I'm one of those stands like up in the corner, so that's one flash, and then there's a

401
00:43:34.32 --> 00:43:39.20
couple of other flashes like that, and then there's a flash when I'm five years old, and I know it,

402
00:43:39.20 --> 00:43:43.44
because I was in kindergarten at the specific school that I was at, and I had just shipped my pants.

403
00:43:44.08 --> 00:43:48.96
And I don't know what happened before that, and I don't know how I reacted to the situation,

404
00:43:48.96 --> 00:43:54.32
it's just like the vision starts, and I've cracked my pants, and then that's all I know, and

405
00:43:54.32 --> 00:44:00.48
like then it fades out, right? And so when I was in the Navy, down at San Diego,

406
00:44:00.48 --> 00:44:06.40
I had a friend who was writing a bike down in Hill, and he fell, and hit his head, and so he was in the

407
00:44:06.40 --> 00:44:11.52
hospital, and concussion workups, and everything for a few days. And he lived with a bunch of

408
00:44:11.52 --> 00:44:15.36
other Navy guys down on one of the really nice neighborhoods in Chulavista, one of those nice

409
00:44:15.36 --> 00:44:20.08
housing developments down there, like two doors away in Admiral lived, and one of those neighborhoods.

410
00:44:20.88 --> 00:44:25.52
And it's a Sunday afternoon, and he's supposed to be coming home from the hospital,

411
00:44:25.52 --> 00:44:29.36
my other buddy's picking him up, and so I'm going to go there and meet him just to see how he's doing

412
00:44:29.36 --> 00:44:35.36
everything. So I get to the house, and they're not there yet, and so I just call him up,

413
00:44:35.84 --> 00:44:39.20
the hospitals taken a while, and so I said I got a book in the car, I'll just read the book,

414
00:44:39.20 --> 00:44:43.68
until you guys get here. So I'm doing this for a little while, and I'm drinking a 20-ounce coffee,

415
00:44:43.68 --> 00:44:48.80
which is a terrible idea, because pretty soon, I start to get a little rumble, right?

416
00:44:48.80 --> 00:44:54.24
And so I call up my friend, and I'm like Richard, any of your doors open or anything like that,

417
00:44:54.24 --> 00:44:57.92
like is there a key somewhere, and I got to go to the bathroom, and he's like, I just piss

418
00:44:57.92 --> 00:45:02.24
in the bushes, I'm like, I gotta do the other thing. He's like, oh, I don't think so, you can go check.

419
00:45:02.24 --> 00:45:06.88
And so I go check and garage door, all the windows, everything is closed, and now since I'm up and

420
00:45:06.88 --> 00:45:12.000
moving around, it's really starting to become a problem, right? And so we had another friend

421
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.84
across the street, and so I run across the street, and I knock on the door, I'm pound pound,

422
00:45:15.84 --> 00:45:22.16
doorbell, doorbell, and nobody's there, and I've run across the street now, so now it's getting worse.

423
00:45:22.16 --> 00:45:27.68
Like, come back, and I'm starting to panic. I'm asking myself, can I get my car and go drive

424
00:45:27.68 --> 00:45:31.20
and look for a gas station or something, but I don't know the neighborhood that well, and I'm not

425
00:45:31.20 --> 00:45:36.000
confident that I can do that. And then now I'm out in the middle of nowhere, I got, I might be out of options.

426
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.24
And so I'm literally, I go down like three or four houses knocking on the front doors, but nobody answers

427
00:45:40.24 --> 00:45:44.48
the door, and I run back to the house and at this point I'm starting to panic, and so I go into his

428
00:45:44.48 --> 00:45:49.60
backyard just so that I'm protected from full view or something, right? And I'm looking around,

429
00:45:49.60 --> 00:45:54.40
and I decide I'm gonna have to take crap in his garden, which is not a, it's not the worst thing

430
00:45:54.40 --> 00:45:59.28
that ever happening, but you go dig a little hole, take crap in the garden, wipe with some leaves,

431
00:45:59.28 --> 00:46:04.24
do what you gotta do. And so I'm going over there and I'm preparing to do this, and I make this

432
00:46:04.24 --> 00:46:10.64
faithful decision. And my point here is I'm in this panicking mindset, and I'm not planning anything,

433
00:46:10.64 --> 00:46:15.92
I'm just acting, I'm just doing whatever, right? And so I look up and they have a backyard,

434
00:46:16.48 --> 00:46:22.08
like a balcony deck coming off the master bedroom, and I look up there and I say I bet that door is not

435
00:46:22.08 --> 00:46:29.84
locked. And for some reason, I just decide I'm gonna try that, and I go over and I'm climbing up,

436
00:46:29.84 --> 00:46:34.88
there's no stairs or anything. So I'm having to like pull myself up and climb up onto this back deck,

437
00:46:34.88 --> 00:46:39.20
and as I'm trying to pull myself up my shoes are real loose, so I kick my shoes off, so I've got

438
00:46:39.20 --> 00:46:43.92
just my socks on, and I'm at this point from the, like, from the strain of getting up there,

439
00:46:43.92 --> 00:46:47.44
that like if that thing's locked, I am crapping on my friend's deck. That's just all there

440
00:46:47.44 --> 00:46:53.44
is to it, right? And so I get up there and I run to the door and I throw it open, sure enough it's open,

441
00:46:53.44 --> 00:46:57.68
and I just run into the place, and I'm already pulling my pants and underwear down as I run into

442
00:46:57.68 --> 00:47:01.36
the master bathroom, and literally doing one of those things where you're like diving,

443
00:47:01.36 --> 00:47:07.12
ass first towards the toilet, like to kind of get there. And as I'm diving like that toward the toilet,

444
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.84
I can't explain this decision like to this day. I look and I realize he's out of toilet paper,

445
00:47:13.84 --> 00:47:19.92
I can't do it here. And so I jump up and pants and underwear down around my ankles,

446
00:47:19.92 --> 00:47:23.60
I run out of the bathroom, run out of his bathroom, and out of his bedroom, and down the upper

447
00:47:23.60 --> 00:47:28.96
hallway, and he has one of those stairways where it kind of, you know, it goes down like halfway,

448
00:47:28.96 --> 00:47:32.16
and then there's a stopping point of platform, and then it goes down at a 90 degree angle.

449
00:47:32.80 --> 00:47:37.92
And so I'm, I mean, my, I'm just, everything is hanging out, ass is hanging out and I run,

450
00:47:37.92 --> 00:47:43.44
and I just jump onto the second deck, turn, jump onto the ground floor, which is like the

451
00:47:43.44 --> 00:47:48.08
bottom right in front of the front door. My socks, because I kicked off my shoes, hit the tile,

452
00:47:48.08 --> 00:47:54.64
slide out, I fall down, bang my head and crap, everywhere. And I'm literally lying there. This

453
00:47:54.64 --> 00:48:00.80
is true story. And so I'm laying there, and for hit at that point, as I'm laying, I mean,

454
00:48:00.80 --> 00:48:07.12
it's going up my back, like I'm laying on my back, and it's just, right? And as I'm laying

455
00:48:07.12 --> 00:48:13.44
there, I had that vision, it just came right to me, of when I was five years old and I had crap

456
00:48:13.44 --> 00:48:21.28
my pants. And it was almost like this mystical thing that happened where it seemed like the two

457
00:48:21.28 --> 00:48:26.56
incidents were somehow connected, right? Like I had had that happen, and then it just my life had

458
00:48:26.56 --> 00:48:32.16
been like one, you know, this tumbling momentum up to this point that had led me to a place where I'm

459
00:48:32.16 --> 00:48:37.92
lying on my friends, you know, tile floor with my crap running up my back, and I'm just laying

460
00:48:37.92 --> 00:48:43.68
it with my head ringing, trying to figure out like just just going over all of the horrible decisions

461
00:48:43.68 --> 00:48:49.36
that I had to make to end up in this situation, and all of the offerings that I had to avoid it,

462
00:48:49.36 --> 00:48:54.16
like I could have just gone to his garden, I could have just, you know, trapped in the toilet upstairs

463
00:48:54.16 --> 00:48:59.28
and solved the toilet paper problem, like, across that bridge when I got to it. But when you're

464
00:48:59.28 --> 00:49:06.88
in this mode where you're just making decisions based on immediate need and whatever, it's funny

465
00:49:06.88 --> 00:49:12.32
like, I didn't mean for this to fit so tightly, like I just, it kind of came in on my head when

466
00:49:12.32 --> 00:49:18.24
you mentioned it. And, you know, you're just making decisions, and then you end up in places that

467
00:49:18.24 --> 00:49:22.40
you really can't explain. And if somebody were to say like, you know, well, you did this and you did

468
00:49:22.40 --> 00:49:26.32
that wrong, you need to this, you're kind of like, yeah, yeah, yeah, but at the time, like it didn't

469
00:49:26.32 --> 00:49:31.60
feel like I was making a decision. I was just, I was just going. And people do that and like,

470
00:49:31.60 --> 00:49:37.44
there are real lot of, you know, and, oh, the, the, actually it's the funny part is the end of that

471
00:49:37.44 --> 00:49:44.16
story was I cleaned everything up and, like I literally, like, I'm just, my head's ringing,

472
00:49:44.80 --> 00:49:50.64
and I walk, I, my, waddling over to my friends bathroom to go clean myself up, just dripping,

473
00:49:50.64 --> 00:49:57.52
disgusting. And I'm like 25 years old, I'm not a child, okay, I'm gonna do it. You're, you're, you're,

474
00:49:57.52 --> 00:50:02.16
you're like, this is literally 2006, you're in Ramadi right now. And this is what I'm doing, okay,

475
00:50:03.12 --> 00:50:08.96
like, and, and, and I get in there, I clean myself up and I do my best to clean up the floor,

476
00:50:08.96 --> 00:50:13.76
but he's got like the ground tile and you can't quite get all the smell out. And so by the time

477
00:50:13.76 --> 00:50:18.64
my friend gets back home with my friend from the hospital, I had a change, I had like gym clothes in my

478
00:50:18.64 --> 00:50:24.24
car. I'm just sitting in my car reading my book, like, stupid, stupid, stupid, and so we go into the house,

479
00:50:24.24 --> 00:50:29.36
and my friend smells their shit somewhere, and he blames his dog and he starts shouting it is

480
00:50:29.36 --> 00:50:36.08
dog and I'm just watching it happen. Like I didn't say anything, I didn't tell him for years after that.

481
00:50:36.96 --> 00:50:42.40
And, but yet people do that with their whole lives, right? And so instead of having, you know,

482
00:50:42.40 --> 00:50:49.52
just, they're head bringing and being splattered with their own shit, you know, they have three

483
00:50:49.52 --> 00:50:55.20
kids and an alcohol problem and maybe a record, you know, from something they did when they were 17

484
00:50:55.52 --> 00:51:01.92
or whatever it is. And they get into this place where like now the enormity of trying to correct

485
00:51:01.92 --> 00:51:08.000
course is so overwhelming for them because they, not only are they in this whole, they, they have

486
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.48
no tools, you know, psychological tools, emotional tools, anything to kind of navigate their way out of this.

487
00:51:14.48 --> 00:51:18.88
It's a lot of people like that now. I think that's why podcasts like yours, Jordan, Peter,

488
00:51:18.88 --> 00:51:24.72
some, it's, they resonate with so many people because they, they, they, they let people know

489
00:51:25.44 --> 00:51:31.20
that you can just take control of your life. Like you can just, you can just take control.

490
00:51:31.20 --> 00:51:35.84
You can start doing the right things like right now. And you know what the right things are,

491
00:51:35.84 --> 00:51:40.08
maybe you don't know what the right things are, like a grand scale, but you know how to,

492
00:51:40.08 --> 00:51:44.08
right, you know how to clean your room, you know, the little things that you don't do every day.

493
00:51:44.08 --> 00:51:49.76
You sleep in, stop sleeping in, get up early, get up at 430. You can do that, you know, and when you get up,

494
00:51:49.76 --> 00:51:56.16
go workout. Maybe you don't know what the long term path is, but those, these little things

495
00:51:56.16 --> 00:52:01.60
that you can start to take control of. And no matter how unstable or chaotic your life is,

496
00:52:01.60 --> 00:52:07.20
you know, you can start to control this little world that can start to expand once you do gain control of it.

497
00:52:08.08 --> 00:52:14.000
And yeah, so I mean, that's one of the reasons I, I really like, it's been 20 years probably

498
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.48
since I read about face, but you know, the, the passage that you just read,

499
00:52:18.48 --> 00:52:22.24
I maybe think about like one of the things that I really liked that of is the idea that you can

500
00:52:22.88 --> 00:52:28.16
be in a situation that feels extremely chaotic. And so that you don't really have any,

501
00:52:28.16 --> 00:52:34.80
anything stable to use as points of reference when you make decisions. But you can still carve out

502
00:52:34.80 --> 00:52:40.56
like a little zone of control and you can make decisions like, you know, take, you can take control of that little

503
00:52:40.56 --> 00:52:46.000
area and you can, you know, you can be the person that, once you got control of your own life,

504
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.24
maybe just the one person that's closest to you needs you to be. And then the two or three or four

505
00:52:50.24 --> 00:52:55.44
people closest to you need you to be. And you can kind of start to, you know, no matter what the situation

506
00:52:55.44 --> 00:53:00.80
is, I'm going to how chaotic it feels, you can start to, you know, take control. And, and,

507
00:53:02.16 --> 00:53:06.96
yeah, like I said, it took me, well, I said 23, 24 earlier, but I'm still

508
00:53:07.60 --> 00:53:13.36
shitting up my back when I'm 25, so maybe I'll push that age for adulthood out a little bit past that.

509
00:53:14.24 --> 00:53:20.72
Now, you and I have talked about this a little bit, but, you know, one of the things that's,

510
00:53:20.72 --> 00:53:31.20
I think, makes you unique is your cognitive capacity. And, you know, for lack of a better way of saying

511
00:53:31.20 --> 00:53:37.60
it, you're smart, you're smart person. And, but when you were in school, like, did,

512
00:53:39.60 --> 00:53:42.48
what was the academic life for you, like when you were in school?

513
00:53:42.48 --> 00:53:53.36
I was a sea student. I think I graduated with like a 2.4. I was one of those kids who, you know,

514
00:53:53.36 --> 00:54:00.40
I'm smart enough. I'm not a genius, but I met that level of smart where, you know, it can be a blessing

515
00:54:00.40 --> 00:54:07.36
or a curse. Just like, you know, you've got a high school athlete who has just been so naturally gifted

516
00:54:07.36 --> 00:54:12.40
that he, you know, in high school, he just never really has to learn more graphic. He just doesn't have to.

517
00:54:12.40 --> 00:54:15.60
And then he gets to college and it's like, oh, everybody's a badass here.

518
00:54:16.16 --> 00:54:19.36
And then it doesn't work out the same way, because you're just, you're not going to develop that,

519
00:54:19.36 --> 00:54:23.92
like overnight now at this point. You had to spend a lot of time doing that. And that's what everybody

520
00:54:23.92 --> 00:54:32.16
else has been doing. And so, you know, I, when I grew up, you know, my home life was chaos a lot of the times.

521
00:54:32.16 --> 00:54:39.12
I mean, really just chaos. And so I would come in and I would ace all of my tests.

522
00:54:39.12 --> 00:54:43.60
And I would, you know, write good papers when those were due. I'd win all the spelling

523
00:54:43.60 --> 00:54:48.48
B's, win all the math contest and so forth. But I could probably count the number of home

524
00:54:48.48 --> 00:54:55.04
work assignments I did on one hand in 12 years. I just didn't do them. And, you know,

525
00:54:55.76 --> 00:54:58.88
you could learn some really negative lessons from that. You know, you can learn that you don't

526
00:54:58.88 --> 00:55:03.76
really have to work on a day-to-day basis because when push comes to shove at the very, very end or

527
00:55:03.76 --> 00:55:08.000
whatever, when the chips are down, you could just sort of throw something, throw things together and make it work.

528
00:55:08.72 --> 00:55:13.12
Which works when you're trying to pass, you know, history in seventh grade.

529
00:55:14.32 --> 00:55:18.16
It doesn't work when you have a serious job of a lot of responsibility and people, you know,

530
00:55:18.16 --> 00:55:22.80
who are depending on you, it doesn't work. And so, I feel very fortunate that I went into the

531
00:55:22.80 --> 00:55:30.96
name because it allowed me sort of a space in my late teens and early 20s to learn some lessons

532
00:55:30.96 --> 00:55:35.60
that if I had to learn a mountain of civilian world, there would have been a lot of greater consequences,

533
00:55:35.60 --> 00:55:42.96
you know, for my, for my growing pains. And so, yeah, academics, I mean, it was, you know,

534
00:55:42.96 --> 00:55:47.04
my teachers generally like me. I kind of, depending on where I was, I could be a little bit of a

535
00:55:47.04 --> 00:55:53.52
clown, have some behavior problems, but, you know, depending on which parts of my childhood,

536
00:55:54.24 --> 00:55:58.56
I could be, I was pretty angry kid, I could be pretty violent sometimes, you know, there's a lot of

537
00:55:58.56 --> 00:56:06.56
violence at home and I had two little sisters that I was looking after and kind of trying to provide

538
00:56:06.56 --> 00:56:13.12
some kind of stability for. And so, I would do my best at home, not to show any emotion, really,

539
00:56:13.12 --> 00:56:16.96
not to show that I was being affected by things that were going on around. But then I would get

540
00:56:16.96 --> 00:56:23.36
school sometimes and I would take it out on other people. And I was never a bully, I got bullied

541
00:56:23.36 --> 00:56:28.32
at home, you know, and so I didn't like bullies, but I would be kind of the kid who was waiting

542
00:56:28.32 --> 00:56:35.04
for excuse. And, you know, I went to a lot of kind of, you know, inner city ghetto schools where I was

543
00:56:35.04 --> 00:56:40.08
the only white kid around and everybody else is in the same boat I am as far as the stuff they're

544
00:56:40.08 --> 00:56:45.12
dealing with at home, you know. And so, you know, you get a bunch of kids who were middle school

545
00:56:45.12 --> 00:56:49.20
at early high school environment like that and there's plenty of excuses to go around if you were

546
00:56:49.20 --> 00:56:54.48
looking for them. And, and yet even despite that, you know, I've gotten fights and I would have

547
00:56:54.48 --> 00:57:01.12
some behavior problems, but, you know, my teachers, generally they kind of, is another one of those,

548
00:57:02.32 --> 00:57:06.96
you know, blessing and a curse thing, right, where they let me slide a little bit. My teachers

549
00:57:06.96 --> 00:57:12.48
would like me for the most part. But they would let me slide on things they probably shouldn't

550
00:57:12.48 --> 00:57:16.72
let me slide on. Just say, like they let me slide on never doing my homework because they assumed that

551
00:57:16.72 --> 00:57:20.96
they kind of knew that things were kind of crazy back home and they would make those excuses for me.

552
00:57:21.84 --> 00:57:25.28
And, you know, you got to learn at some point, this is something I didn't get until I was in the

553
00:57:25.28 --> 00:57:29.68
Navy and had some good leadership there that you're going to reach a certain point in your life where

554
00:57:29.68 --> 00:57:34.16
nobody's going to care about your excuses anymore. It's just not going to matter. Like people will,

555
00:57:34.80 --> 00:57:38.24
they might sympathize or something, but that's just, it's not their problem. You're in adult now,

556
00:57:38.24 --> 00:57:44.08
which means your problems are your own. You know, and if you're looking around when you encounter a

557
00:57:44.08 --> 00:57:49.36
problem for who's going to fix it without realizing that like, oh, I'm the guy, like I'm a grown-up now.

558
00:57:49.36 --> 00:57:53.12
So I'm actually the one who's supposed to address this problem, like other people are supposed to be

559
00:57:53.12 --> 00:57:59.52
looking to me. You know, that's kind of, that's kind of, I guess, what I would maybe define as an adult,

560
00:57:59.52 --> 00:58:04.000
right, is if you encounter something rather than having like a dependent mindset where you're looking

561
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.04
around, who's going to fix this, you realize intuitively, you're the one, you know, and that

562
00:58:09.04 --> 00:58:13.04
doesn't happen for a lot of people for a long, long time in their lives, if ever, and it didn't

563
00:58:13.04 --> 00:58:20.56
happen for me until I made 20s. And, you know, again, it's one of those things that maybe you just sort of

564
00:58:20.56 --> 00:58:26.16
have some set of experiences or something in you where it just clicks naturally. But, you know,

565
00:58:26.16 --> 00:58:32.24
if I think for most people, you pick that up by watching the adults around you take responsibility

566
00:58:32.24 --> 00:58:37.76
for their own lives. And if you're not exposed to that, that it can take a long time, you know,

567
00:58:37.76 --> 00:58:43.60
and it took some, you know, some ass kickings in the Navy from some my leaders to kind of bang

568
00:58:43.60 --> 00:58:47.92
that into my head. People that I owe a lot to, you know, really owe a lot to. And I was a

569
00:58:47.92 --> 00:58:54.16
huge pain in their butts for a long time. But, you know, I owe them a lot for sure.

570
00:58:54.80 --> 00:59:00.08
You, uh, I guess maybe you're senior year, you took the SATs and got a perfect score in your SATs.

571
00:59:00.08 --> 00:59:04.96
Yeah. And I had, you know, I was graduating with, like I said, about a 2.4,

572
00:59:05.76 --> 00:59:10.16
and nobody really knew I was or anything. I was just a normal average goofball. And then I

573
00:59:10.16 --> 00:59:16.32
ace my SATs and, you know, so I get called in for like a meeting with the school counselors and

574
00:59:16.32 --> 00:59:21.36
everything and they kind of talked to me about living up to my potential and all those kind of things.

575
00:59:23.36 --> 00:59:27.36
You know, I just, I wasn't into a place at that point where it was going to make much of a dent,

576
00:59:27.36 --> 00:59:32.88
you know, at that one place. Yeah, at that point in my life. Like I knew I was a smart enough kid,

577
00:59:32.88 --> 00:59:39.20
but when you're growing up in a home like that, I think, you know, one of the things that we,

578
00:59:39.20 --> 00:59:47.36
we'll be all struggle with is, you know, you grow up with a, with a, with a very limited sense

579
00:59:47.36 --> 00:59:51.44
of your own. I don't want to say your own capabilities because you have, it doesn't necessarily,

580
00:59:51.44 --> 00:59:56.72
not that you don't think you can do things or accomplish tasks or something, but a very limited

581
00:59:56.72 --> 01:00:07.36
sense of your own, of your own worth, you know, you, you, you, every kid who comes up in a broken home

582
01:00:09.68 --> 01:00:14.96
has this little voice. Maybe some people find a way to overcome it, but I think most people,

583
01:00:14.96 --> 01:00:19.60
they just learn to live with it and, you know, sort of, put in its proper place,

584
01:00:19.60 --> 01:00:24.000
its whispering, the back of your head all the time, then no matter how things look around,

585
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.92
you no matter what other people are telling you, no matter how good your life is going,

586
01:00:28.56 --> 01:00:33.44
it's end of the day, you're basically worthless, you know, you come out of the gutter,

587
01:00:33.44 --> 01:00:40.72
and that's where you belong, and it's just, it's something that, you know, when you come from a certain

588
01:00:40.72 --> 01:00:46.88
kind of background that is going to be in there, it's like, you know, when a Roman general

589
01:00:46.88 --> 01:00:51.60
would be celebrated in a triumph and they'd be in their chariot on a parade and everybody's cheering

590
01:00:51.60 --> 01:00:56.48
for them, they would put, you know, a slave behind them to whisper in his ear that despite all this,

591
01:00:56.48 --> 01:01:00.48
you were only mortal, just to remind them of that, it's like a really pathological version of that.

592
01:01:01.04 --> 01:01:08.24
All glory is fleeting. Yes. Yeah. And, um, and so, you know, the idea that,

593
01:01:09.04 --> 01:01:14.72
I think about when I have kids, the thing that I want to get into their heads, and I think about

594
01:01:14.72 --> 01:01:21.04
us all the time how I'm going to do it, right? Um, is I want them to have in their heads that like,

595
01:01:21.04 --> 01:01:25.84
you know, if you want to be an astronaut, just pick the craziest thing, you want to be a fighter pilot,

596
01:01:26.40 --> 01:01:31.36
you want to pick the craziest thing. It is purely a matter of deciding that that's what you're

597
01:01:31.36 --> 01:01:36.80
going to do, and then just focusing on it and step by step by step, just ruthlessly pursuing it,

598
01:01:36.80 --> 01:01:40.96
and then you can literally do whatever you want. You can do whatever you want. There's nothing that's

599
01:01:40.96 --> 01:01:47.44
closed off to you just kind of by the nature of life, you know, and when you, uh, when nobody kind

600
01:01:47.44 --> 01:01:52.40
of teaches you that, and for whatever reason you don't pick it up in other ways, you know, maybe you,

601
01:01:53.04 --> 01:01:57.04
you know, you figure out when you're 30 that like, oh, if I want to start focusing on this when I was

602
01:01:57.04 --> 01:02:02.24
15, then, you know, whatever, but like most people get to the point where, by the time they start to,

603
01:02:02.24 --> 01:02:06.56
if they come out of that state, you know, they've got so many obligations or the couple kids,

604
01:02:06.56 --> 01:02:12.08
whatever it is that now your life is kind of on a certain track, and, you know, that's the thing that

605
01:02:12.08 --> 01:02:17.20
I would love to get into my kids heads, that, you know, there are no limits to what you can do if you

606
01:02:17.20 --> 01:02:20.80
decide you want to do it. There's nothing that's just naturally closed off to you because of who you are,

607
01:02:20.80 --> 01:02:25.28
or what you are, anything like that. But, you know, that's something that kids have to learn, or maybe

608
01:02:25.28 --> 01:02:30.56
it's the other way. Maybe they, maybe they start out that way and they learn to think of themselves as

609
01:02:30.56 --> 01:02:36.08
limited. I don't know, but I think kids have a hard time and I was give this advice to parents

610
01:02:36.08 --> 01:02:41.92
and to kids when I talk to kids, is kids have a hard time connecting the fact that what they're doing now

611
01:02:42.88 --> 01:02:48.08
will impact their future. And the way that you behave right now is going to impact the way you,

612
01:02:48.48 --> 01:02:54.80
the way you end up in life. And I think that's a major connection that doesn't get made. And then

613
01:02:55.60 --> 01:03:01.04
the other thing is when you say to yourself, well, what do you want to be when you grow up? And your

614
01:03:01.04 --> 01:03:06.80
answer is, I don't know. That's not a good answer because it doesn't give you anything to aim at, right?

615
01:03:07.20 --> 01:03:12.64
But if you say, I do, if the, the fall on for a parent, when you ask your kid, hey, what do you want to be

616
01:03:12.64 --> 01:03:17.44
when you grow up and your kid goes, I don't know. Then what you need to explain to them is, okay,

617
01:03:17.44 --> 01:03:22.40
then I want you to have the most amount of options possible. And the way you have the most amount of

618
01:03:22.40 --> 01:03:27.12
options possible is to be a good athlete, do good in school, work hard, learn to work good, work

619
01:03:27.12 --> 01:03:32.08
ethics, state, you know, stay out of trouble. If you do that when you're young and you don't know

620
01:03:32.08 --> 01:03:36.08
what you want to do, when you get older, you'll have a bunch of different options to pick from.

621
01:03:36.08 --> 01:03:39.92
If you don't do that and you don't do good in school and you don't take care of yourself

622
01:03:39.92 --> 01:03:43.76
and you don't work hard, you don't get good work ethic and you get in trouble. All a lot of those

623
01:03:43.76 --> 01:03:48.48
options are going to close down. That's the way it works. And so you have to explain those things to your

624
01:03:48.48 --> 01:03:54.08
kids when they're, and you have to explain it to them over and over and over again so that they get it

625
01:03:54.08 --> 01:03:59.92
because otherwise they don't. And you know, like I said, for me, I was super lucky because

626
01:04:00.96 --> 01:04:08.24
all my craziness, you know, all all energy going in multiple different directions and most of

627
01:04:08.24 --> 01:04:12.80
them bad, all of a sudden with the signing of one piece of paper, all of a sudden they all

628
01:04:12.80 --> 01:04:20.16
became focused in the right in a positive way. And that was very helpful to me and very helpful to you.

629
01:04:20.16 --> 01:04:26.88
But yeah, so before we jump into the Navy, so you get a perfect score on the SATs, which is insane,

630
01:04:26.88 --> 01:04:31.12
especially like I understand this kids that get perfect scores on the SATs a lot of them go to,

631
01:04:31.12 --> 01:04:36.24
you know, a tutor and study and computer systems and they do all this stuff and they take all the

632
01:04:36.24 --> 01:04:41.12
classes and they study all these classes all the time. You basically, obviously you have the natural

633
01:04:41.12 --> 01:04:48.32
ability and then just reading, which makes me feel very vindicated or reinforced because I always tell

634
01:04:48.32 --> 01:04:52.72
little kids, hey, the way you get smarter is by reading, read, read, read, read, that's what you do.

635
01:04:52.72 --> 01:04:58.48
It worked for you, apparently. Yeah, yeah, definitely that. I mean, did you get any like pressure,

636
01:04:58.48 --> 01:05:02.56
like, hey, you need to go to college? Well, this was pretty, this was pretty late my senior year

637
01:05:02.56 --> 01:05:06.64
by this point and so I had kind of already decided that I was going to go to the state university

638
01:05:06.64 --> 01:05:10.72
where some of my friends were going at the time and I didn't spend much time there. I went there

639
01:05:10.72 --> 01:05:14.72
for a year and realized that I didn't know what I wanted to major in and I planned on going into the

640
01:05:14.72 --> 01:05:20.96
Navy afterwards anyway and my grandfather was in the Navy retired as a chief and so I just said,

641
01:05:20.96 --> 01:05:25.12
well, I'm not going to waste any more money here any more time here and so I joined the Navy

642
01:05:25.92 --> 01:05:30.48
and it was a life-changing decision. Did you join to do any specific job?

643
01:05:31.68 --> 01:05:37.52
No, I was at a point where I'm designated to the fleet. No, I, you know, I ace my ass

644
01:05:37.52 --> 01:05:44.88
of ab and so, you know, they wanted to make me a nuke but I couldn't go nuke, I couldn't leave for like 18 months

645
01:05:44.88 --> 01:05:50.08
I was going to be nuke and so they put me in as, you know, doing electronics, I could, you start off

646
01:05:50.08 --> 01:05:54.80
in the same school and you could be an ET or a fire controlman and fire controlman sounded cooler.

647
01:05:54.80 --> 01:06:03.12
Wacoer? So, and so I went down that road and I'm very glad I did. I've loved my job ever

648
01:06:03.12 --> 01:06:08.48
since, you know, as far as my actual, the actual stuff I work on and everything I love it.

649
01:06:08.48 --> 01:06:14.24
So, when you joined the Navy, what was boot camp like? Was it like a positive experience because

650
01:06:14.24 --> 01:06:18.80
you were getting structure and a paycheck and all those things? Especially the structure and

651
01:06:18.80 --> 01:06:23.04
and kind of like what you were talking about all of a sudden, I had a game that I knew the rules

652
01:06:23.04 --> 01:06:27.84
too, you know, that was like, that's kind of the thing when you grew up with instability,

653
01:06:27.84 --> 01:06:31.68
is you just don't know what the rules are. You don't know like what actions am I supposed to take

654
01:06:31.68 --> 01:06:36.40
that'll actually lead me to a positive place? Because it just seems like no matter what you do,

655
01:06:36.96 --> 01:06:41.76
you know, it's, it's not like you take a step forward, towards some goal and then another step

656
01:06:41.76 --> 01:06:46.08
forward and another step forward. It's you take a step forward and then the situation changes

657
01:06:46.88 --> 01:06:51.04
and you're in a new place and now you take another step forward and the situation changes and

658
01:06:51.04 --> 01:06:56.32
you're in a new place. And so you can very easily get into a play, you can get out, you can get

659
01:06:56.32 --> 01:07:02.24
up sort of a learned helplessness in a situation like that where you're just kind of focused on

660
01:07:02.24 --> 01:07:07.04
trying to provide yourself a little bit of stability, you know, in your personal emotional world a

661
01:07:07.04 --> 01:07:12.40
little bit. You know, with my sisters at the time and that's all you're really focused on. You

662
01:07:12.40 --> 01:07:16.08
don't, you just don't know the rules, you don't know the rules of the game. And when you get into boot camp,

663
01:07:16.08 --> 01:07:20.96
you know, I went in, when I joined the Navy because I had some college credits, I said,

664
01:07:20.96 --> 01:07:24.48
we can make you a knee three and I said, well, what do I got to do to do that? I said,

665
01:07:24.48 --> 01:07:29.36
you know, go get your transcripts and so forth and I'm like, I want to leave like as soon as possible.

666
01:07:29.36 --> 01:07:34.08
Like, I don't care about that. I want to get out of here. And so I left three days after I walk into

667
01:07:34.08 --> 01:07:41.60
the recruiters off. Basically. What year was that? 2001 January. So also it's pre-September 11th

668
01:07:41.60 --> 01:07:46.40
and you were able to leave in three days. I might be exaggerating a little bit, but it was very

669
01:07:46.40 --> 01:07:52.80
rapid. I mean, it was really rapid. And so I was on the bus in from the time I got there,

670
01:07:52.80 --> 01:07:57.52
I love boot camp because it was, where did you go to boot camp San Diego? No, great legs. They didn't

671
01:07:57.52 --> 01:08:04.56
have anywhere but great legs. Oh, okay. And I was in January and my, I, I, I, I, what I,

672
01:08:04.56 --> 01:08:10.56
RDC, my drill instructor was this guy who was, he's, he had already been in like 25 years. He was a

673
01:08:10.56 --> 01:08:14.96
Navy diver. He had this, he literally looked like Popeye. He was kind of jacked and he had this

674
01:08:14.96 --> 01:08:24.08
screwed up, real face, really recruit. And he was, his name was HTC Brian. And he was just such a bad

675
01:08:24.08 --> 01:08:29.92
ass. I mean, you know, I, I grew up without a father, you know, and I had like an uncle and a grandfather

676
01:08:29.92 --> 01:08:34.88
who I would spend time with for periods of my childhood who were good role models for me and

677
01:08:34.88 --> 01:08:40.40
like provided some stability and like some idea of what, you know, a virtuous man looked like and

678
01:08:40.40 --> 01:08:45.04
strong man with his, with his life together looked like, but like all of a sudden I had this dude who was

679
01:08:45.04 --> 01:08:50.24
like, he was just like a rock, you know, and he was, and the thing that the thing that boot camp

680
01:08:50.24 --> 01:08:57.04
did for me that I think this is probably the biggest lesson most, most kids who were just unstructured

681
01:08:57.04 --> 01:09:01.76
get out of it is when they would do things like you remember when they would do things like, you know,

682
01:09:01.76 --> 01:09:07.44
one drill instructor would come up and tell you to, you know, make your rack and do all these other

683
01:09:07.44 --> 01:09:10.96
things like you got a half hour to do it and he'll leave and then another one will come and tell

684
01:09:10.96 --> 01:09:15.68
you to do a whole bunch of other stuff that's going to take you 29 minutes. And so then you're done with

685
01:09:15.68 --> 01:09:18.88
that and you know, the first one comes back and says, why is he in your rack made and done it

686
01:09:18.88 --> 01:09:23.20
on a, a, a, a, a, a, he knows that you didn't have time to make make you rack. The point is he's trying to

687
01:09:23.20 --> 01:09:28.72
teach you that the answer is not, oh, I couldn't do it because of such and such and so and so the answer is

688
01:09:28.72 --> 01:09:34.96
Roger that, I'll make my rack right now that whatever your excuses are nobody cares. Nobody cares

689
01:09:34.96 --> 01:09:42.40
and for me that was it was it was the most helpful thing about boot camp and so I went in as any one,

690
01:09:42.96 --> 01:09:49.20
even though they offered me three, I went in as any one but in boot camp, they made me the, you know,

691
01:09:49.20 --> 01:09:55.52
recruit chief petty officer to our park right away and then I pick, you know, for the, for all of the

692
01:09:55.52 --> 01:10:00.96
graduating divisions, I was the honor recruit and so they made me an E3 anyway coming out of boot camp

693
01:10:00.96 --> 01:10:07.68
and, you know, from then, like once I got into the technical school pipeline, you know, I was

694
01:10:08.40 --> 01:10:14.000
the class leader all the way through, I ace all my schools and I was just like, you know, on point

695
01:10:14.88 --> 01:10:19.04
it was just, you know, it was nice to know the rules of the game and to know that if I do the following

696
01:10:19.04 --> 01:10:26.80
things right, then people are going to people that I respect and who's approval I want are going to be

697
01:10:26.80 --> 01:10:33.28
happy with me and you know that just sort of the incentives and inputs were, you know, it's hard,

698
01:10:33.28 --> 01:10:38.24
it's hard to describe when you come from such an unstable environment how liberating it is to be in a place

699
01:10:38.24 --> 01:10:44.72
where, you know, there are known rules to the game and you know, you know, how to play it.

700
01:10:44.72 --> 01:10:50.24
It was, it was very, very good for me. So, you know, that's a good leadership perspective there,

701
01:10:50.24 --> 01:10:54.24
you know, I talk all the time about how you got to light, you know, and not only I talk about

702
01:10:54.24 --> 01:10:59.12
what's all them, I do this all the time. If you work for me, you got all kinds of leeway to

703
01:10:59.12 --> 01:11:04.96
move around and make things happen and step up and execute things, but occasionally I'll work with a

704
01:11:04.96 --> 01:11:11.76
a boss who has got so much who's so laws-a-fair and so hands-off that no one actually knows what's happening

705
01:11:12.64 --> 01:11:17.28
and the, and the same thing I'll say, listen, you know, I'm talking to your front line and I'm talking to

706
01:11:17.28 --> 01:11:22.24
mid-level managers, they don't even know what it is that you want them to do and so, you know,

707
01:11:22.24 --> 01:11:25.36
we'll formulate a plan of, all right, here's the mission, here's what we're trying to get

708
01:11:25.36 --> 01:11:29.12
done, here's our goals, here's our priorities and they put that out and then I'll go and talk to

709
01:11:29.12 --> 01:11:36.000
the, you know, the, the, the subordinate leadership and they'll be so happy because it's just what you said.

710
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.96
They go from not knowing the rules of the game, what are we focused on, what am I supposed to do?

711
01:11:38.96 --> 01:11:43.44
And how do I, how do I move through this system right now to like, okay, I got it,

712
01:11:43.44 --> 01:11:48.24
you want me to do these things? Thank you for telling me. So, that is something that as a leader,

713
01:11:48.24 --> 01:11:52.64
you have to be careful of and that's something that that definitely, you know, you and I had the same

714
01:11:52.64 --> 01:11:58.64
experience, cool, I'm playing a game now and I know the rules. So, what was, when you, how long was your,

715
01:11:58.64 --> 01:12:05.68
we are fire control school? Explain what that is a little bit. So, fire control is not being a fireman,

716
01:12:06.32 --> 01:12:13.28
fire control is working on naval weapon systems. And so, I worked on the A just weapon system,

717
01:12:13.28 --> 01:12:19.36
which is the air defense and ballistic missile defense system. We've got on all of our destroyers and cruisers right now.

718
01:12:21.28 --> 01:12:28.16
My school was about a year and a half. And so, you start out in like a basic electronic schools.

719
01:12:28.16 --> 01:12:31.76
People, you know, a lot of people on the outside, they don't understand. They're taking people off the street.

720
01:12:32.72 --> 01:12:38.48
And basically making effective, they don't know what an electron is. They don't know why it is

721
01:12:38.48 --> 01:12:42.64
that when you plug something in the lights, come on. I didn't know any of that, right? And it was electricity.

722
01:12:43.84 --> 01:12:48.64
And they got to take you and turn you into somebody who can go, you know, take a bunch of test equipment,

723
01:12:48.64 --> 01:12:52.72
and a bunch of tools, and go figure out what's wrong with a hundred million dollar radar, right?

724
01:12:52.72 --> 01:12:57.04
Yeah. And they do that in a relatively short period of time. I mean, Navy schools, the tech schools,

725
01:12:57.68 --> 01:13:02.48
I think people who come out of those schools are colleges got to be such a cakewalk, you know,

726
01:13:02.48 --> 01:13:09.36
for doing that. Like, we were in class for eight hours a day, and then we had a couple hours of mandatory

727
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.20
group study sessions every night. And that was five days a week. Every weekend, we had homework that

728
01:13:15.20 --> 01:13:19.68
was going to take four hours both days, you know, eight hours total, something like that. We did that for a year and a half.

729
01:13:19.68 --> 01:13:25.52
And it was, you know, they pack a lot in. And I mean, you know, if you really like focus on getting an education in there,

730
01:13:25.52 --> 01:13:31.28
they will make you like pretty competent, you know, in a really, pretty rapid period of time. And so that was a year and a half.

731
01:13:31.28 --> 01:13:37.60
And then I get put on, I was on a, I was learning about a brand new system. I went to the first ship that ever had it, right?

732
01:13:37.60 --> 01:13:45.04
This variant of the spy radar, the ages spy radar. And so I get there and the ship's kill has just been laid basically in Pascagula.

733
01:13:45.44 --> 01:13:51.84
And so I get sent to San Diego to wait for the ship to be built. And it's not going to be done for another year and a half, two years.

734
01:13:51.84 --> 01:13:59.12
And so I don't see a ship in the Navy until I've already been in, yeah, over three years.

735
01:13:59.12 --> 01:14:04.08
So what did you do for that year and a half? It was pretty awesome, actually. So we didn't have all

736
01:14:04.08 --> 01:14:09.92
to do it. We didn't have, especially for like the first eight, nine months or so. We had very little supervision because we were some of the first people that got there.

737
01:14:09.92 --> 01:14:18.08
And I think when my little group of ages text showed up there, the ship had a exo, a command master chief,

738
01:14:18.32 --> 01:14:23.44
one other chief who was out in Pascagula, and then us out here by ourselves. And that's basically how it stayed for a long time.

739
01:14:23.44 --> 01:14:31.44
And so we played the other base teams in Saafball. We had a lot of those like computer-rated, you know, little classes that you got to take on

740
01:14:31.44 --> 01:14:37.04
the teaching nothing because you never seen a ship. So like all these things you're reading about, have to do a seam and ship.

741
01:14:37.04 --> 01:14:43.04
Don't mean anything to you. But then after I had started to, I had already done all the computer-rated, like tests.

742
01:14:43.04 --> 01:14:48.40
I was done with that, right? It's nothing left for me to do. And other people start showing up at this point.

743
01:14:48.40 --> 01:14:56.40
And I figured out that they used to call like SSEW and then they had like the bunch of advanced shooting courses basically.

744
01:14:56.40 --> 01:15:00.40
They had the simulation one that they did on the pigeon down, pure thirteen.

745
01:15:00.40 --> 01:15:04.40
I don't know if you ever seen the ship down there that you go on and basically play counter strike.

746
01:15:04.40 --> 01:15:10.40
And I had already done everything. And so I just started asking, can I go to this one again? Can I go to this one again?

747
01:15:10.40 --> 01:15:14.40
I would go to these like eight, nine, ten weeks in a row just going to the shooting courses all the time.

748
01:15:14.40 --> 01:15:28.40
So it's pretty great. And yeah, so that was a year and a half. I got to the ship in 2004, just over three years, that I've been in at that point.

749
01:15:28.40 --> 01:15:36.40
And yeah, I got to the ship and my attitude started to change a little bit. I had some setbacks and I was on the ship.

750
01:15:36.40 --> 01:15:48.40
I just didn't work very well with, I worked really well up to that point where I could be where there was a route for me to be the hot shot.

751
01:15:48.40 --> 01:15:53.40
You know, in boot camp, that's exactly what happened in my schools. That's exactly what happened.

752
01:15:53.40 --> 01:16:00.40
And when I was at the pre-commit attachment, that's exactly what happened. Like I was the man out there, because it was just a limited group of people.

753
01:16:00.40 --> 01:16:08.40
And it was a defined number of activities that we were engaging in. And so when I get out to the ship, there's a much larger group of people.

754
01:16:08.40 --> 01:16:14.40
There's senior people, I'm in E4. And I'm just another face in the crowd at this point.

755
01:16:14.40 --> 01:16:18.40
And a junior sailor, no big carers, right?

756
01:16:18.40 --> 01:16:28.40
But I was immature still by this point. I'm 23 as opposed. And I just start having class, especially with a cheese mess.

757
01:16:28.40 --> 01:16:33.40
You know, just having wars with these guys. I was a pain in the ass. I was a huge pain in the ass.

758
01:16:33.40 --> 01:16:37.40
I look back on it now and I know some of my cheese from back then. I'm like, dude, I'm so sorry.

759
01:16:37.40 --> 01:16:38.40
Like I was such a pain.

760
01:16:38.40 --> 01:16:40.40
What were you doing just projecting?

761
01:16:40.40 --> 01:16:42.40
I was making you sad.

762
01:16:42.40 --> 01:16:43.40
Trolling?

763
01:16:43.40 --> 01:16:49.40
You know, in a way where I never showed up to work, drunk, I never showed up to work late.

764
01:16:49.40 --> 01:16:53.40
I never had any liberty in it. It's nothing like that, right?

765
01:16:53.40 --> 01:16:55.40
You weren't even worse kind of problems.

766
01:16:55.40 --> 01:17:00.40
I was the worst kind of problem. And it took me a long time to figure out why.

767
01:17:00.40 --> 01:17:06.40
And the fact that I never had any of those quote unquote more serious discipline problems allowed me to think I was getting picked on, right?

768
01:17:06.40 --> 01:17:08.40
But I bunch of people just didn't like me.

769
01:17:08.40 --> 01:17:10.40
Because I would look at these other people.

770
01:17:10.40 --> 01:17:13.40
This is actually what happened that turned me around. I literally had an overnight turnaround.

771
01:17:13.40 --> 01:17:17.40
I went to captain's mask three times in one year.

772
01:17:17.40 --> 01:17:21.40
I got convicted all three times for what?

773
01:17:21.40 --> 01:17:23.40
Disrespecting cheap petty officer.

774
01:17:23.40 --> 01:17:25.40
You were in a captain's mask?

775
01:17:25.40 --> 01:17:27.40
Disrespecting if it was a petty officer?

776
01:17:27.40 --> 01:17:28.40
I was a problem.

777
01:17:28.40 --> 01:17:29.40
That was a problem.

778
01:17:29.40 --> 01:17:31.40
Give me at least a little bit of example.

779
01:17:31.40 --> 01:17:36.40
Because only because in the sealed teams, I don't know that I can remember.

780
01:17:36.40 --> 01:17:42.40
I don't remember anyone ever getting sent to captain's mask for disrespecting a cheap petty officer.

781
01:17:42.40 --> 01:17:47.40
For a couple reasons, the primary reason is you would just get, you know, catch a beat down.

782
01:17:47.40 --> 01:17:50.40
Like that just, it just not going to happen. You could beat down.

783
01:17:50.40 --> 01:17:53.40
And I wish somebody could have just kicked my ass out.

784
01:17:53.40 --> 01:17:56.40
So you get captain.

785
01:17:56.40 --> 01:17:58.40
Give me an example. That is freaking insane.

786
01:17:58.40 --> 01:18:01.40
You know, I don't think any of them were particularly aggrieved.

787
01:18:01.40 --> 01:18:02.40
Here's what I would do, right?

788
01:18:02.40 --> 01:18:09.40
Is I was actually like an artist at, at figuring out exactly where the lines were.

789
01:18:09.40 --> 01:18:10.40
I knew what the rules were.

790
01:18:10.40 --> 01:18:11.40
And then where the lines are.

791
01:18:11.40 --> 01:18:15.40
And then just taking all my clothes off and tiptoeing along them.

792
01:18:15.40 --> 01:18:16.40
Like, ha ha ha ha.

793
01:18:16.40 --> 01:18:18.40
I'm not touching you. I'm not touching you, right?

794
01:18:18.40 --> 01:18:20.40
Like, just being a judge you into counts.

795
01:18:20.40 --> 01:18:21.40
But I'm getting pissed off.

796
01:18:21.40 --> 01:18:23.40
Yeah, just being a king in the ass.

797
01:18:23.40 --> 01:18:26.40
And like, here's an example.

798
01:18:26.40 --> 01:18:30.40
Like one time, this is a perfect example of the kind of things that we do.

799
01:18:30.40 --> 01:18:38.40
After the first Iraq elections in 2005, you know, the purple fingers and everything.

800
01:18:38.40 --> 01:18:47.40
I know perfectly well that writing out an all-hands email is something that the captain,

801
01:18:47.40 --> 01:18:50.40
the exo and the command mash chief, are allowed to do.

802
01:18:50.40 --> 01:18:54.40
Nobody else allowed to do. You can't have every e4 writing out all hands emails, right?

803
01:18:54.40 --> 01:18:55.40
No, you can't.

804
01:18:55.40 --> 01:19:03.40
And so I write up this long email with pictures of the people with the, you know, the purple fingers and like telling everybody like, you know,

805
01:19:03.40 --> 01:19:04.40
look at what we've accomplished.

806
01:19:04.40 --> 01:19:10.40
And this is such a great thing that like the US military has helped to make happen and dada dada dada and fired out to all.

807
01:19:10.40 --> 01:19:12.40
So you wait, you wrote a serious email.

808
01:19:12.40 --> 01:19:14.40
Yes, but I would say.

809
01:19:14.40 --> 01:19:15.40
But you knew it kind of was.

810
01:19:15.40 --> 01:19:20.40
Well, it, I would say that I did it because I did it to be a panias.

811
01:19:20.40 --> 01:19:30.40
But I meant what I said, but I also was like, ah, like I can troll them here and they can't really do anything because I'm celebrating what we've accomplished and like, you know,

812
01:19:30.40 --> 01:19:31.40
whatever.

813
01:19:31.40 --> 01:19:33.40
That's the kind of thing I would do, right?

814
01:19:33.40 --> 01:19:36.40
And once or twice, it's like, okay, yeah, not get off.

815
01:19:36.40 --> 01:19:42.40
But I was persistent and I would, it got to a point where,

816
01:19:42.40 --> 01:19:49.40
um, and took one, one guy first class who I had just banged heads with, uh, for a long time before this.

817
01:19:49.40 --> 01:19:50.40
I hated him.

818
01:19:50.40 --> 01:19:51.40
And he hated me.

819
01:19:51.40 --> 01:19:56.40
And after this, we got to be great friends literally like, he turned me around a one day.

820
01:19:56.40 --> 01:20:03.40
So, um, the third time I go up, I got 45, 45 days of restriction next to duty all three times, right?

821
01:20:03.40 --> 01:20:04.40
And one year.

822
01:20:04.40 --> 01:20:09.40
And we were on deployment for like five months of that year and we didn't count under way time.

823
01:20:09.40 --> 01:20:12.40
So I was locked on the ship for like nine months.

824
01:20:12.40 --> 01:20:14.40
And one year.

825
01:20:14.40 --> 01:20:21.40
And, um, and, uh, because one of them had to do with like, you know, sitting out the all hands, you

826
01:20:21.40 --> 01:20:23.40
mail for a good portion, I didn't have any computer access or anything.

827
01:20:23.40 --> 01:20:26.40
I'm just in jail like on the ship.

828
01:20:26.40 --> 01:20:30.40
And, um, and the last time that it happened,

829
01:20:30.40 --> 01:20:32.40
Wait, so what's the last time that what happened?

830
01:20:32.40 --> 01:20:33.40
That I went to captain's man.

831
01:20:33.40 --> 01:20:36.40
What was the last, what was the last defense?

832
01:20:36.40 --> 01:20:37.40
Um, okay, yes.

833
01:20:37.40 --> 01:20:43.40
So this is, yeah, this is perfect because it, it just set everything up perfectly for me to get turned around.

834
01:20:43.40 --> 01:20:45.40
Um, and it doesn't sound like that first.

835
01:20:45.40 --> 01:20:52.40
So what happened was at this point, they, they were so tired of my crap that they were definitely like just looking for a reason, right?

836
01:20:52.40 --> 01:20:57.40
And, uh, and I knew it and I felt persecuted because of it, right?

837
01:20:57.40 --> 01:20:59.40
Even though I'm totally being a pain.

838
01:20:59.40 --> 01:21:06.40
Um, and so they, they found something like I was, uh, I, I, I done, I was a person that designated person in the division of time.

839
01:21:06.40 --> 01:21:09.40
Who was supposed to do our maintenance on our damage control equipment.

840
01:21:09.40 --> 01:21:14.40
Which kind of details you to, like another division, the damage control division part time.

841
01:21:14.40 --> 01:21:17.40
And so there was a time where I was supposed to go do maintenance on our fire hoses and after you're done,

842
01:21:17.40 --> 01:21:21.40
you put this sealant on, I'm to protect him from the elements, something like that.

843
01:21:21.40 --> 01:21:25.40
And at that particular time, the ship was out and the, of the sealant.

844
01:21:25.40 --> 01:21:29.40
And so the guy, the damage control guy who's in charge of everything, that particular time,

845
01:21:29.40 --> 01:21:32.40
you told everybody, just don't worry about it this time, go do your maintenance.

846
01:21:32.40 --> 01:21:33.40
And so I went and did it.

847
01:21:33.40 --> 01:21:40.40
So a month or two later, I get written up for having gun-deck this maintenance because I said that I did it in accordance with the card,

848
01:21:40.40 --> 01:21:43.40
but I didn't use this sealant. You can tell because they're all rusty.

849
01:21:43.40 --> 01:21:48.40
And so in that instance, I was able to bring like 15 other people who were all able to vouch for me and show it.

850
01:21:48.40 --> 01:21:50.40
And so that you did like, were you in straight?

851
01:21:50.40 --> 01:21:52.40
Uh, what's that movie?

852
01:21:52.40 --> 01:21:54.40
Uh, you went straight.

853
01:21:54.40 --> 01:21:58.40
What's the damn Jack Nicholson movie?

854
01:21:58.40 --> 01:21:59.40
A few good mad.

855
01:21:59.40 --> 01:22:01.40
You went like straight.

856
01:22:01.40 --> 01:22:03.40
You brought witnesses in.

857
01:22:03.40 --> 01:22:04.40
Did you do that?

858
01:22:04.40 --> 01:22:09.40
I had one person who was in my division who knew that I was telling the truth and I was like,

859
01:22:09.40 --> 01:22:12.40
I can bring people in like, and they knew that I was right.

860
01:22:12.40 --> 01:22:14.40
I convinced them at the time that I was right.

861
01:22:14.40 --> 01:22:19.40
But I was also like, I was, so this, I was completely innocent this time.

862
01:22:19.40 --> 01:22:23.40
Like, of this, right? Not innocent, but of this, I was innocent.

863
01:22:23.40 --> 01:22:26.40
And they still gave me 45, 45, but all three of those times.

864
01:22:26.40 --> 01:22:30.40
So 45 days restriction and 45 days has been.

865
01:22:30.40 --> 01:22:31.40
Special duty.

866
01:22:31.40 --> 01:22:32.40
No, especially.

867
01:22:32.40 --> 01:22:33.40
They never took any pay.

868
01:22:33.40 --> 01:22:38.40
And even though I went three times in one year, they never busted me down because they kind of knew that part of it was personal.

869
01:22:38.40 --> 01:22:42.40
Part of it was that I had a personal problem with some of these guys, but you know,

870
01:22:42.40 --> 01:22:44.40
that screw my personal problems.

871
01:22:44.40 --> 01:22:45.40
I'm so bored of it.

872
01:22:45.40 --> 01:22:47.40
Like they're Jesus and I'm not right.

873
01:22:47.40 --> 01:22:48.40
So Roger that.

874
01:22:48.40 --> 01:22:50.40
This is like the worst.

875
01:22:50.40 --> 01:22:51.40
I'm serious.

876
01:22:51.40 --> 01:22:53.40
I'm saying this is like the most annoying.

877
01:22:53.40 --> 01:22:54.40
Oh, the worst.

878
01:22:54.40 --> 01:22:56.40
Leadership problem.

879
01:22:56.40 --> 01:22:57.40
It's so annoying.

880
01:22:57.40 --> 01:22:59.40
Especially when you have somebody who's smart enough to sort of.

881
01:22:59.40 --> 01:23:00.40
Totally.

882
01:23:00.40 --> 01:23:05.40
But you know, and just, you know, while I'm saying that, like what I absolutely would have done with you is I would have put you on a fast track.

883
01:23:05.40 --> 01:23:06.40
I would have put you in charge of things.

884
01:23:06.40 --> 01:23:08.40
Like I would have done things.

885
01:23:08.40 --> 01:23:09.40
Okay.

886
01:23:09.40 --> 01:23:14.40
So I'm up upstairs in one of our combat systems spaces.

887
01:23:14.40 --> 01:23:16.40
And this time, like, I'm really feeling agree.

888
01:23:16.40 --> 01:23:19.40
So now that you've already been, you've been, you know, you're under sentence.

889
01:23:19.40 --> 01:23:23.40
This is, this is later that day after I've been sentenced.

890
01:23:23.40 --> 01:23:28.40
And so I'm really feeling victimized here because I'm actually innocent of this.

891
01:23:28.40 --> 01:23:30.40
And I'm still in that mindset, right?

892
01:23:30.40 --> 01:23:31.40
And I've got my chief up there.

893
01:23:31.40 --> 01:23:33.40
And my chief at the time, he's a great guy.

894
01:23:33.40 --> 01:23:34.40
He's a good chief.

895
01:23:34.40 --> 01:23:36.40
But he did not know how to deal with me.

896
01:23:36.40 --> 01:23:38.40
Like he was just, he's too nice.

897
01:23:38.40 --> 01:23:40.40
And I needed someone to put a boot on my ass.

898
01:23:40.40 --> 01:23:41.40
And he was not that guy.

899
01:23:41.40 --> 01:23:42.40
And he's a great guy.

900
01:23:42.40 --> 01:23:43.40
I know him today.

901
01:23:43.40 --> 01:23:45.40
And he's just an awesome dude.

902
01:23:45.40 --> 01:23:49.40
And he's one of the people I apologize to on a regular basis.

903
01:23:49.40 --> 01:23:51.40
And so I get, I corner him basically.

904
01:23:51.40 --> 01:23:52.40
And there's other people in the space.

905
01:23:52.40 --> 01:23:54.40
And I am just tearing him apart.

906
01:23:54.40 --> 01:23:55.40
Like I do this.

907
01:23:55.40 --> 01:23:56.40
I do that.

908
01:23:56.40 --> 01:23:57.40
I do all this work in the division.

909
01:23:57.40 --> 01:23:59.40
And what about this person who showed up drunk?

910
01:23:59.40 --> 01:24:00.40
He didn't go to campus mass.

911
01:24:00.40 --> 01:24:02.40
What about this person who didn't show up from liberty and like,

912
01:24:02.40 --> 01:24:03.40
Miss ships movement.

913
01:24:03.40 --> 01:24:05.40
He didn't go to campus mass and you're targeting me for this.

914
01:24:05.40 --> 01:24:07.40
That's where I was at.

915
01:24:07.40 --> 01:24:09.40
And from a perspective, I was right.

916
01:24:09.40 --> 01:24:11.40
And so I am just laying into him.

917
01:24:11.40 --> 01:24:13.40
And he doesn't know what to say.

918
01:24:13.40 --> 01:24:17.40
And so this first class, who is my LPO at the time.

919
01:24:17.40 --> 01:24:18.40
And I don't like him.

920
01:24:18.40 --> 01:24:19.40
And he doesn't like me.

921
01:24:19.40 --> 01:24:22.40
And it's funny because he, this was,

922
01:24:22.40 --> 01:24:27.40
this was, he was, he was like, he was a,

923
01:24:27.40 --> 01:24:29.40
he's a very interesting personality.

924
01:24:29.40 --> 01:24:32.40
He's like, he's kind of a nerd,

925
01:24:32.40 --> 01:24:34.40
but he was like kind of an alpha personality.

926
01:24:34.40 --> 01:24:35.40
Still, he was a sailor.

927
01:24:35.40 --> 01:24:36.40
He was like, I took his job seriously.

928
01:24:36.40 --> 01:24:38.40
And like, you know, if you just caught him out on the street,

929
01:24:38.40 --> 01:24:41.40
he's not some like alpha personality necessarily.

930
01:24:41.40 --> 01:24:44.40
But like when he's doing his job, he takes it seriously, right?

931
01:24:44.40 --> 01:24:47.40
So he sees me tearing up our chief, his chief too.

932
01:24:47.40 --> 01:24:49.40
And he's like, oh, god, like I could go save him.

933
01:24:49.40 --> 01:24:50.40
And so he runs in there.

934
01:24:50.40 --> 01:24:53.40
And he's listens to me talk for another like 30 seconds or so.

935
01:24:53.40 --> 01:24:56.40
And then he just turns around and he starts blighting into me.

936
01:24:56.40 --> 01:24:58.40
And I go back and forth with him.

937
01:24:58.40 --> 01:25:00.40
Crowds gatherin up at this point.

938
01:25:00.40 --> 01:25:03.40
And then he says, are you seriously gonna look me in the eye

939
01:25:03.40 --> 01:25:07.40
and tell me that you play no role in putting yourself in the position you're in right now?

940
01:25:07.40 --> 01:25:09.40
And I was like,

941
01:25:09.40 --> 01:25:11.40
hmm, okay.

942
01:25:11.40 --> 01:25:13.40
Couldn't say that, right?

943
01:25:13.40 --> 01:25:14.40
And and he's like, I'll tell you what.

944
01:25:14.40 --> 01:25:17.40
Like this isn't, this isn't World War II.

945
01:25:17.40 --> 01:25:18.40
We don't shoot disorders.

946
01:25:18.40 --> 01:25:23.40
Okay, this is a, this is a Navy these days where, you know, if you don't want to be here,

947
01:25:23.40 --> 01:25:25.40
I'll take you to the old man.

948
01:25:25.40 --> 01:25:26.40
He will sign it.

949
01:25:26.40 --> 01:25:28.40
You won't even get a dishonorable discharge.

950
01:25:28.40 --> 01:25:30.40
If you want to leave, we'll let you leave.

951
01:25:30.40 --> 01:25:32.40
And every day that you're not doing that,

952
01:25:32.40 --> 01:25:34.40
you're re-enlisting for 24 hours.

953
01:25:34.40 --> 01:25:36.40
Every day you come in and show up for work.

954
01:25:36.40 --> 01:25:39.40
You're re-enlisting for 24 hours because you can leave if you want to.

955
01:25:39.40 --> 01:25:43.40
Nobody's gonna prosecute you for deserves to know whatever.

956
01:25:43.40 --> 01:25:44.40
Like you can leave.

957
01:25:44.40 --> 01:25:47.40
And so don't tell me that like this is such an awful and horrible place.

958
01:25:47.40 --> 01:25:50.40
To be and everything is just wrong with it or whatever,

959
01:25:50.40 --> 01:25:53.40
because every day you're volunteering to come in here.

960
01:25:53.40 --> 01:25:56.40
And when, you know, every time I kind of try to tell the story to people,

961
01:25:56.40 --> 01:25:59.40
it doesn't hit them as profoundly as it hit me.

962
01:25:59.40 --> 01:26:04.40
But at the time, it just, it made me realize that all of the

963
01:26:04.40 --> 01:26:07.40
the entire mentality that I had carried forward into that point,

964
01:26:07.40 --> 01:26:09.40
up to that point on the ship.

965
01:26:09.40 --> 01:26:11.40
It was just, it was all wrong.

966
01:26:11.40 --> 01:26:15.40
It was a completely dependent mindset where I was looking completely outside myself

967
01:26:15.40 --> 01:26:18.40
for the cause of all my unhappiness and problems and everything.

968
01:26:18.40 --> 01:26:23.40
And he just got me to see that it doesn't matter what situation.

969
01:26:23.40 --> 01:26:26.40
Like the ship was disciplinary mass.

970
01:26:26.40 --> 01:26:30.40
It was a tough place to like if that's the environment you're adapting yourself to,

971
01:26:30.40 --> 01:26:32.40
it's easy to go a ride, right?

972
01:26:32.40 --> 01:26:33.40
It was a tough play.

973
01:26:33.40 --> 01:26:38.40
It was our captain got escorted off by Marines like as soon as we got back from

974
01:26:38.40 --> 01:26:39.40
sail around what happened.

975
01:26:39.40 --> 01:26:41.40
So we're in the Panama Canal.

976
01:26:41.40 --> 01:26:46.40
In the captain was an animal. He'd be a guy who like he was a guy who like seemed like

977
01:26:46.40 --> 01:26:50.40
he read about being a captain in World War II and now he had his ship.

978
01:26:50.40 --> 01:26:54.40
And he's walking through the interior of the ship with a lit stove in his mouth

979
01:26:54.40 --> 01:26:56.40
and he's just being a captain, right?

980
01:26:56.40 --> 01:26:59.40
He was a great guy in a lot of ways, but he's a wild man.

981
01:26:59.40 --> 01:27:02.40
And we're in the Panama Canal coming over to San Diego.

982
01:27:02.40 --> 01:27:06.40
And when you park in the Panama Canal, sometimes they tie you off to the

983
01:27:06.40 --> 01:27:11.40
big, wide concrete boys, right, that kind of keep you in place.

984
01:27:11.40 --> 01:27:13.40
And so we were doing that.

985
01:27:13.40 --> 01:27:17.40
And one of the panamanians dipped the line and it got caught up in our propeller and it

986
01:27:17.40 --> 01:27:22.40
sucked this giant concrete buoy down and destroyed our propeller and twisted the

987
01:27:22.40 --> 01:27:25.40
shaft up going all the way up into the ship, right?

988
01:27:25.40 --> 01:27:28.40
And so we get stuck in the Panama Canal for several days.

989
01:27:28.40 --> 01:27:31.40
It's like basically trying to figure out what to do with ourselves.

990
01:27:31.40 --> 01:27:33.40
Everybody's super stressed out.

991
01:27:33.40 --> 01:27:37.40
The chitters are completely full because when you're in the Panama Canal you can't

992
01:27:37.40 --> 01:27:38.40
discharge.

993
01:27:38.40 --> 01:27:40.40
So they have to bring on portapoddies.

994
01:27:40.40 --> 01:27:41.40
Those are all full.

995
01:27:41.40 --> 01:27:45.40
People are leaving bags of crap in closet so they can go through them over

996
01:27:45.40 --> 01:27:46.40
board at night time.

997
01:27:46.40 --> 01:27:48.40
So they're there for like four or five days.

998
01:27:48.40 --> 01:27:51.40
Everybody's super heated.

999
01:27:51.40 --> 01:27:56.40
And when we're going to pull out finally, they tell us just go to Limpum on

1000
01:27:56.40 --> 01:28:01.40
one propeller just go.

1001
01:28:01.40 --> 01:28:06.40
And I'm standing a watch in combat and all of a sudden as we're getting ready to go.

1002
01:28:06.40 --> 01:28:09.40
I hear the captain come over the intercom, right?

1003
01:28:09.40 --> 01:28:11.40
The one MC.

1004
01:28:11.40 --> 01:28:14.40
No, like you know, crew, this is Captain or anything like that.

1005
01:28:14.40 --> 01:28:17.40
He says, Master at arms, this is the captain.

1006
01:28:17.40 --> 01:28:19.40
Get up to the bridge right now.

1007
01:28:19.40 --> 01:28:24.40
He has the Panamanian pilot arrested and can find the pilot.

1008
01:28:24.40 --> 01:28:28.40
The Panama Canal is one of the only places where the captain gives that control

1009
01:28:28.40 --> 01:28:32.40
of a ship.

1010
01:28:32.40 --> 01:28:36.40
There's a pilot who is panamanian down there who will drive your ship like

1011
01:28:36.40 --> 01:28:40.40
when you're either docking or leaving dock, right?

1012
01:28:40.40 --> 01:28:43.40
And so he has this guy arrested and can find because he gets into a huge fight with

1013
01:28:43.40 --> 01:28:45.40
them drives the ship out himself.

1014
01:28:45.40 --> 01:28:48.40
Hits the pier on the way out and then has the border master's doctor the

1015
01:28:48.40 --> 01:28:50.40
logs to keep it out.

1016
01:28:50.40 --> 01:28:55.40
And the exo at the time did the right thing.

1017
01:28:55.40 --> 01:28:59.40
And then when we got back, he reported it because you know, I want to hand it's like

1018
01:28:59.40 --> 01:29:01.40
there's some people who thought it was disloyal.

1019
01:29:01.40 --> 01:29:04.40
I'm like there's a bunch of jails up there who their whole career is just screwed.

1020
01:29:04.40 --> 01:29:07.40
If there anywhere near this, he saved all of those guys.

1021
01:29:07.40 --> 01:29:08.40
He did the right thing.

1022
01:29:08.40 --> 01:29:11.40
And so yeah, so it's a chaotic ship.

1023
01:29:11.40 --> 01:29:16.40
There was a period like a couple of years in where I think a third of the

1024
01:29:16.40 --> 01:29:20.40
leadership all got, you know, swapped out and booted off the ship for

1025
01:29:20.40 --> 01:29:25.40
frat andization. All once we had an external investigation because everybody was just sleeping with everybody.

1026
01:29:25.40 --> 01:29:27.40
Was it this plenary? Was there females on board?

1027
01:29:27.40 --> 01:29:28.40
Yeah.

1028
01:29:28.40 --> 01:29:29.40
Yeah.

1029
01:29:29.40 --> 01:29:36.40
And so, but you know, and yet it was this guy, my LPO at the time, who really somehow,

1030
01:29:36.40 --> 01:29:39.40
like he, I'm not a type person.

1031
01:29:39.40 --> 01:29:43.40
It's easy to shut up, you know, like especially if I'm like getting going, like,

1032
01:29:43.40 --> 01:29:45.40
whatever, like, I'm just I'm coming.

1033
01:29:45.40 --> 01:29:47.40
Just like I was coming at that chief.

1034
01:29:47.40 --> 01:29:50.40
And for him to be able to just shut me down like that.

1035
01:29:50.40 --> 01:29:53.40
Like people who were there were like, they looked at me like, oh, what's he going to say now?

1036
01:29:53.40 --> 01:29:55.40
And I just had nothing to say.

1037
01:29:55.40 --> 01:29:57.40
And I went down to my rack.

1038
01:29:57.40 --> 01:29:58.40
This now I'm on restrictions.

1039
01:29:58.40 --> 01:30:00.40
My first day of restriction.

1040
01:30:00.40 --> 01:30:03.40
And I literally go down to my rack and I lie down and I can feel something work

1041
01:30:03.40 --> 01:30:04.40
inside me.

1042
01:30:04.40 --> 01:30:09.40
And I just, I just, I don't, I can't, it's hard to kind of really describe.

1043
01:30:09.40 --> 01:30:10.40
But I woke up the next day.

1044
01:30:10.40 --> 01:30:13.40
And I was not just a different person.

1045
01:30:13.40 --> 01:30:14.40
My jaw is a completely different person.

1046
01:30:14.40 --> 01:30:17.40
It was like I, it was like I'm a churn ten years overnight.

1047
01:30:17.40 --> 01:30:20.40
We're all of a sudden I woke up in the morning and I was like, oh, this is my life now.

1048
01:30:20.40 --> 01:30:23.40
And it didn't feel like that before in the same way.

1049
01:30:23.40 --> 01:30:26.40
I could be like, you know, when I was doing well in boot camp in school and everything,

1050
01:30:26.40 --> 01:30:28.40
it's like, I can be good at this game.

1051
01:30:28.40 --> 01:30:29.40
I was going to say you're playing a game.

1052
01:30:29.40 --> 01:30:30.40
Right.

1053
01:30:30.40 --> 01:30:35.40
But, you know, getting to the point of realizing that like whatever the environment is around me,

1054
01:30:35.40 --> 01:30:40.40
like, I've got my own responsibility to like, you know, take care of my own circle here.

1055
01:30:40.40 --> 01:30:47.40
And literally the next day, like I just completely different person, this was late in 2005.

1056
01:30:47.40 --> 01:30:50.40
And around early 2006.

1057
01:30:50.40 --> 01:30:55.40
So this is just a few months after I get off restriction for the third time this year.

1058
01:30:55.40 --> 01:30:57.40
And I'm a second class at the time.

1059
01:30:57.40 --> 01:31:01.40
Because we're pre-commed, we got everybody at once at the beginning.

1060
01:31:01.40 --> 01:31:04.40
And so all of our leadership is changing out all at once.

1061
01:31:04.40 --> 01:31:06.40
And they got to find another LPO.

1062
01:31:06.40 --> 01:31:11.40
And this was just a few months after me coming off my third stance on restriction in less than 12 months.

1063
01:31:11.40 --> 01:31:14.40
And they made me the LPO because I had turned around that much.

1064
01:31:14.40 --> 01:31:16.40
And part of it was because we had this one guy on board.

1065
01:31:16.40 --> 01:31:19.40
He was an older guy who kind of joined the fleet late.

1066
01:31:19.40 --> 01:31:23.40
He was like a bouncer in Texas, 65 to 60.

1067
01:31:23.40 --> 01:31:26.40
Arnry dude, really great guy, but an Arnry dude.

1068
01:31:26.40 --> 01:31:29.40
And he had kind of enough personal problems with other people in the division.

1069
01:31:29.40 --> 01:31:33.40
They couldn't make him the LPO, but they knew nobody else in the division could handle him.

1070
01:31:33.40 --> 01:31:36.40
Just on a personality level. And so they put me in charge.

1071
01:31:36.40 --> 01:31:38.40
And it was exactly what you said.

1072
01:31:38.40 --> 01:31:45.40
As soon as I got to a point where I realized that the well-being of these other people is now depending on me.

1073
01:31:45.40 --> 01:31:50.40
You know, if I want to go start a fight with a chief, that's going to roll downhill on these other guys.

1074
01:31:50.40 --> 01:31:55.40
As soon as that happened, I mean, my mindset completely shifted.

1075
01:31:55.40 --> 01:31:57.40
It was a revelation.

1076
01:31:57.40 --> 01:31:59.40
And so the next year, I was 2005.

1077
01:31:59.40 --> 01:32:03.40
I got convicted of Catherine's mass three times.

1078
01:32:03.40 --> 01:32:08.40
In 2006, I was the destroyer squadron sailor of the year and got a 50 Eval.

1079
01:32:08.40 --> 01:32:14.40
And our division was the hot division on the ship.

1080
01:32:14.40 --> 01:32:18.40
You know, we gave out 50 Eval.

1081
01:32:18.40 --> 01:32:20.40
Yeah, that's insane.

1082
01:32:20.40 --> 01:32:22.40
I was on fire, man.

1083
01:32:22.40 --> 01:32:26.40
I just, I wasn't just like I kind of realized like,

1084
01:32:26.40 --> 01:32:29.40
oh, I can kind of do the right thing now.

1085
01:32:29.40 --> 01:32:32.40
It was like this revelation to me.

1086
01:32:32.40 --> 01:32:33.40
I was eating it up.

1087
01:32:33.40 --> 01:32:36.40
I was like, oh, I can just go do all the right things.

1088
01:32:36.40 --> 01:32:39.40
And I can take control of this situation.

1089
01:32:39.40 --> 01:32:44.40
And then, you know, I don't have to wait for other people to sort of tell me it's all right or to tell me what to do.

1090
01:32:44.40 --> 01:32:46.40
Or I don't have to be reactive.

1091
01:32:46.40 --> 01:32:48.40
I can just actually go make things happen.

1092
01:32:48.40 --> 01:32:50.40
And it was just a huge revelation.

1093
01:32:50.40 --> 01:32:52.40
So I was just eating it up.

1094
01:32:52.40 --> 01:32:57.40
And yeah, and I, you know, I, I owe that guy a lot.

1095
01:32:57.40 --> 01:32:59.40
You know, I owe that guy a lot.

1096
01:32:59.40 --> 01:33:02.40
And he and I after that, we got along great.

1097
01:33:02.40 --> 01:33:06.40
He was, this was before Donas, Don't Tell Got ShitChand.

1098
01:33:06.40 --> 01:33:08.40
And so he was, he was gay.

1099
01:33:08.40 --> 01:33:16.40
And when we would go and we got to be like enough friends that when we would go into ports in like Australia and other places and he would want to go off to like a bar somewhere.

1100
01:33:16.40 --> 01:33:19.40
He couldn't tell anybody else like I would go with him because he had to have a liberty buddy.

1101
01:33:19.40 --> 01:33:20.40
Yeah, they have some to go with him.

1102
01:33:20.40 --> 01:33:23.40
And so I would go and that's that's a good friend.

1103
01:33:23.40 --> 01:33:24.40
Yeah, yeah.

1104
01:33:24.40 --> 01:33:29.40
So I was going to an airport for the first time and however long and you're going to go to the gay bar with the home.

1105
01:33:29.40 --> 01:33:39.40
And I would just hang out and like, yeah, dudes, if you go to a gay bar in Australia, you know, you're, those use a pretty aggressive.

1106
01:33:39.40 --> 01:33:43.40
So you have to like, you know, kind of be ready to just keep cool.

1107
01:33:43.40 --> 01:33:49.40
But I mean, that's how close I got to this guy, you know, really great friends with that guy and to this day.

1108
01:33:49.40 --> 01:33:50.40
Like, I owe him a lot.

1109
01:33:50.40 --> 01:33:57.40
And I owe a lot to all the people who put up with my crap for as long as they did because they had plenty of excuses to just be like, you know, it's guys not worth the trouble.

1110
01:33:57.40 --> 01:33:58.40
They held out of here.

1111
01:33:58.40 --> 01:34:01.40
They could have booted my ass out for a million different things.

1112
01:34:01.40 --> 01:34:04.40
Not for, you know, again, not, I'm punching anybody in the face or anything.

1113
01:34:04.40 --> 01:34:06.40
But I just, I was not worth the trouble.

1114
01:34:06.40 --> 01:34:12.40
What they were at the work and everything else they were getting out of me was not anywhere near, you know, the trouble I was given them.

1115
01:34:12.40 --> 01:34:14.40
And it's like you said, it's in a way.

1116
01:34:14.40 --> 01:34:18.40
It's the worst kind of trouble to deal with because, you know, what I finally realized is that I was going to be a little bit more

1117
01:34:18.40 --> 01:34:30.40
You know, what I finally realized was the reason that the guy who showed up drunk doesn't have to necessarily go to captain's mask and get hammered the way they were coming after me is after they come to him and say how dare you.

1118
01:34:30.40 --> 01:34:31.40
This is wrong.

1119
01:34:31.40 --> 01:34:34.40
Whatever he puts his head down and he says, Roger that.

1120
01:34:34.40 --> 01:34:36.40
He submits to the authority of the chain of command.

1121
01:34:36.40 --> 01:34:43.40
And that was what it was my entire life was making a show of the fact that I did not respect the chain of command.

1122
01:34:43.40 --> 01:34:53.40
Because my whole goal on the ship was to basically like be a performance artist at, at, at coming up with creative ways to flip off the chain of command.

1123
01:34:53.40 --> 01:35:00.40
But doing it in ways again where I know where the lines are, I know what the rules are so that once you hammer me for it, I can say this is in fair.

1124
01:35:00.40 --> 01:35:09.40
Even though I'm totally provoking them, like 100% and everybody knows it, they know it, but worse, all of the other junior sailors know it.

1125
01:35:09.40 --> 01:35:14.40
And so if they don't hammer me, that undermines the entire authority structure.

1126
01:35:14.40 --> 01:35:18.40
If they don't come squash me, they have to figure out how to get me to bend the knee.

1127
01:35:18.40 --> 01:35:24.40
And because as long as I exist like that, like, you know, it could break down the discipline on the whole ship.

1128
01:35:24.40 --> 01:35:26.40
And I finally understood that.

1129
01:35:26.40 --> 01:35:30.40
You know, I finally understood why they had to come after me the way they did.

1130
01:35:30.40 --> 01:35:35.40
And, you know, it just, it took ownership for my own situation, you know.

1131
01:35:35.40 --> 01:35:40.40
And, but again, I took somebody getting in my face and shut me down.

1132
01:35:40.40 --> 01:35:45.40
And, and, and, and if he hadn't walked in there that day, I don't, I know I wouldn't have learned how lesson.

1133
01:35:45.40 --> 01:35:49.40
I would have just hammered my chief and walked off like, I asked, you know, got him.

1134
01:35:49.40 --> 01:35:53.40
And that would have been that. I've never would have learned that lesson, at least not in that timeframe.

1135
01:35:53.40 --> 01:36:01.40
So once you were now squared away, it's now 2005, what was you, you're going on to, how many departments did you do on that ship?

1136
01:36:01.40 --> 01:36:09.40
Two. In both of them, we were doing independent deployments actually supporting some of your buddies out in the Philippines.

1137
01:36:09.40 --> 01:36:16.40
Okay. Yeah, we were supporting SWIC and CL operations, you know, when they were fighting and surgeons down some of the southern islands there.

1138
01:36:16.40 --> 01:36:22.40
You know, since then, I worked for the DOD now and I deploy with ships sometimes.

1139
01:36:22.40 --> 01:36:28.40
And so I've gone on, I don't know, 10 or 15 deployments, at least for good chunks of them.

1140
01:36:28.40 --> 01:36:35.40
I've been all over the place at this point, but yeah, that was, so that was 06 when they put me in charge of the division.

1141
01:36:35.40 --> 01:36:41.40
And we actually didn't have a chief at the time either. So I was a second class for a while and I was our acting chief.

1142
01:36:41.40 --> 01:36:46.40
And there was a chiefs mess full of guys that hated my guts and I had to learn to navigate that too.

1143
01:36:46.40 --> 01:36:53.40
And some of those guys that was personal enough by that point, they didn't really care much so that I kind of turned my attitude around took some time.

1144
01:36:53.40 --> 01:37:02.40
But yeah, and once you turn your attitude around and you are now doing with these chiefs,

1145
01:37:02.40 --> 01:37:08.40
sometimes you see people slip back, right? Like they, they get some chief that they didn't respect before,

1146
01:37:08.40 --> 01:37:18.40
but now they try to turn over a new leaf. And when they do, it's like that guy, that guy, they still just can't put their ego and check enough to stand down.

1147
01:37:18.40 --> 01:37:29.40
Were you able to stand down? Well, I would say, two degree, right? So I was the acting LCPO and I was a second class, right?

1148
01:37:29.40 --> 01:37:40.40
Which meant that we didn't have a real chief kind of defending our guys. And a lot of times my second classes and third classes would get stuck with extra work,

1149
01:37:40.40 --> 01:37:51.40
that no other division wanted to do. And so to a degree, like I became very, very protective of my guys, like very, very protective.

1150
01:37:51.40 --> 01:37:57.40
Because you gotta remember, like I'm now in charge of a bunch of people who watched me go to Athens last three times last year.

1151
01:37:57.40 --> 01:38:02.40
Right? And I gotta navigate that leadership issue. Some of them are older than me. There's two first classes in the division.

1152
01:38:02.40 --> 01:38:07.40
I'm only a second class. You know, and I have to figure out how to deal with these 20, 25 people.

1153
01:38:07.40 --> 01:38:16.40
And I, it's not like I can walk in one day and, you know, because I've ironed my uniform properly, coming in and be like, now everybody listening to me, like that's not a work, right?

1154
01:38:16.40 --> 01:38:23.40
And it's funny because as I've been doing this latest podcast series on Jim Jones, I've realized something that in a way what I did is I started a cult.

1155
01:38:23.40 --> 01:38:36.40
Not like a person, I like cult where they worship me or anything, but in a way where I definitely created like a very strong us versus them us versus the rest of the ship kind of mentality, right?

1156
01:38:36.40 --> 01:38:50.40
And it bonded everybody together. One of the things I'm most proud of in my whole life is that I would say 80% of the group that was in our division for those couple years to this day, since 10 years ago, they're all still friends.

1157
01:38:50.40 --> 01:38:58.40
Or they're at least like one degree of friend separated from each other. Like if we had to get together today, everybody would be like right there, like they'd just see each other.

1158
01:38:58.40 --> 01:39:07.40
Created some very powerful relationships, but it was very much like a, you know, like when I would have somebody get in trouble, one kid got a DUI.

1159
01:39:07.40 --> 01:39:14.40
Am I going to come up to him after I've been to campus last three times last year and be like, well, how dare you? This is just unacceptable, Mr.

1160
01:39:14.40 --> 01:39:21.40
As I don't work, right? And so what I would do is I would say, look, you know, things are pretty good in our division right now, right?

1161
01:39:21.40 --> 01:39:29.40
And so I would say, you guys, each of the, each of the work centers, I give you guys a lot of leeway to run your own business and I don't like come over your shoulders all the time.

1162
01:39:29.40 --> 01:39:37.40
There are a bunch of chiefs on this ship who would love to get on their evaluation that they're the CF, you know, it was our division that there are divisional chief, right? They're, they're circle and like,

1163
01:39:37.40 --> 01:39:55.62
centrally we'll contact each other, we'll get in touch if we say, reassré how they are good, you know, in the future, they're going to work, right? It's just like, but in the future, you know, be there and make our un aren't going to become an 61 and it's always going to be so kind of

1164
01:39:55.62 --> 01:40:03.58
feeling profited you create that us versus them vibe and you know you can only only go

1165
01:40:03.58 --> 01:40:08.98
around thinking that you know other people don't like you so long before just make you

1166
01:40:08.98 --> 01:40:13.90
true right true. I always had to be careful that because I'd get the whole gang mentality

1167
01:40:13.90 --> 01:40:18.98
going and it would be us against the world and you know everyone's no ha I'd have to pull

1168
01:40:18.98 --> 01:40:24.66
back the reins a little bit because you know you got 22 year old JP to now and somebody

1169
01:40:24.66 --> 01:40:30.42
says something bad about the task unit and he is ready to murder someone you know I

1170
01:40:30.42 --> 01:40:34.90
have to pull the reins a little bit you know because it gets a little crazy in the in the

1171
01:40:34.90 --> 01:40:40.58
days so what made you decide did you make first class then pretty quick pretty quick

1172
01:40:40.58 --> 01:40:44.58
yeah once I had that one you must have ace the freaking test and you had a five OE

1173
01:40:44.58 --> 01:40:49.38
valve yeah I mean they were only promoting three four five percent up to first class for

1174
01:40:49.38 --> 01:40:54.42
my rate at the time but yeah I pretty much ace the test and I'd a five OE valve so I made it

1175
01:40:54.42 --> 01:41:01.06
pretty quickly and then I got because of the way that the schedule worked out I was just

1176
01:41:01.06 --> 01:41:05.62
like a little kink in the schedule I got to know I got to pick my orders my short duty orders

1177
01:41:05.62 --> 01:41:10.74
before I had to decide whether I wanted to reinlust which is a beautiful thing and so I ended

1178
01:41:10.74 --> 01:41:17.46
up taking taking orders up at Portway Neeme which is where it's like the engineering place for

1179
01:41:17.46 --> 01:41:23.54
the age-is-weapon system and anytime we would do you know major technical or training

1180
01:41:23.54 --> 01:41:27.94
evolution guys from there would come out and and work with us the engineers who have been

1181
01:41:27.94 --> 01:41:30.98
working with this stuff for a long time and so they kind of knew who I was and I developed

1182
01:41:30.98 --> 01:41:36.26
some relationships with them when I was still in the ship and so when my orders came up you know

1183
01:41:36.26 --> 01:41:41.54
they kind of helped me get out there and yeah I was a good experience too because you get into a

1184
01:41:41.54 --> 01:41:45.54
place like that where you think you're pretty good at your job you think you have an idea what you're

1185
01:41:45.54 --> 01:41:49.70
doing and then you get around people who really know what they're doing and you realize like you're

1186
01:41:49.70 --> 01:41:54.82
like a little baby you know and yeah it's a great place to live it's a great place to work so

1187
01:41:54.82 --> 01:41:59.22
I've enjoyed that as well I'm taking me all over the world a lot of freedom in my job you know

1188
01:41:59.22 --> 01:42:06.66
a lot of ability to kind of operate independently so it was good and then at one point I what so

1189
01:42:06.66 --> 01:42:11.70
so this whole time you're still reading a ton I assume so like in this job for example I would

1190
01:42:11.70 --> 01:42:19.70
say I would I would be away from home traveling um 78% of the year like sometimes I'm going 10-11

1191
01:42:19.70 --> 01:42:24.82
once a year and a lot of that time is out on deployed ships or I'm out in a place like Bahrain

1192
01:42:24.82 --> 01:42:29.22
or somewhere else where there's not a whole lot going on and I would bring a suitcase full my

1193
01:42:29.22 --> 01:42:34.42
clothes and work out year and everything and a suitcase full of books and I would just read that's

1194
01:42:34.42 --> 01:42:38.74
all I would do and I was out there by myself. I what point did you start thinking about making a podcast?

1195
01:42:38.74 --> 01:42:49.46
when some of my friends told me to make one so that I could leave them alone I you know I was

1196
01:42:51.94 --> 01:42:58.42
hardcore history fan like everybody else right and uh it takes a long time between hardcore history

1197
01:42:58.42 --> 01:43:02.58
episodes and you want something else to be there and this isn't the early the earlier days 2015

1198
01:43:02.58 --> 01:43:08.42
there weren't like 100 thousand punch podcasts there and so um I happen to be reading a lot about

1199
01:43:08.42 --> 01:43:12.18
the history of this really Palestinian conflict for the last couple of years and I'm always talking

1200
01:43:12.18 --> 01:43:16.42
my friends about it and they're like finally one of them said why don't you just go start a podcast

1201
01:43:16.42 --> 01:43:20.26
you always complain about hardcore history taking too long just go make one of between those episodes

1202
01:43:20.26 --> 01:43:27.78
and so I said okay I'll give that a shot and um yeah so I started working on that one and um

1203
01:43:27.78 --> 01:43:31.78
that was another one of those it was it was another one of those revelations where it's very humbling

1204
01:43:31.78 --> 01:43:39.06
in a way um I got to the point where I had read maybe six or eight books on the pre-1948 period

1205
01:43:39.06 --> 01:43:44.98
of the Israeli Palestinian conflict if you've read six to eight books on a topic like it's

1206
01:43:44.98 --> 01:43:49.94
easy to pretty good it's pretty easy to think yourself and pre-expert yeah and so I start making

1207
01:43:49.94 --> 01:43:55.54
like the first episode and the second episode and by the time I kind of you know I'm outlining

1208
01:43:55.54 --> 01:44:01.14
them and kind of put them together and by the time I kind of get up to like episode three or four

1209
01:44:01.14 --> 01:44:06.34
of like how I'm making my outlines now I've read like 20 or 30 books and I would look back at like

1210
01:44:06.34 --> 01:44:11.54
the first episode that I had put together when I'd read like six and I realized it was it was

1211
01:44:11.54 --> 01:44:16.90
hilariously bad like not just like you missed this little point here whatever but that you had

1212
01:44:16.90 --> 01:44:22.98
I had no idea what I was talking about and then when I you know I think all the time now about like

1213
01:44:22.98 --> 01:44:28.26
it's really easy to get me to pontificate for hours about some topic that I read one book about

1214
01:44:28.26 --> 01:44:33.46
you know and these are this is a topic that like I had read six or eight books on at the time

1215
01:44:33.46 --> 01:44:38.58
and having to look back and realize it I knew nothing about it like the most basic kind of

1216
01:44:38.98 --> 01:44:43.86
had you already recorded a part number one you just laid out the notes yeah okay here's the

1217
01:44:43.86 --> 01:44:49.54
right there's so glad that I that I took my time you know by the time I got through that entire six

1218
01:44:49.54 --> 01:45:00.42
episode series you know I read close to a hundred books parts of another couple hundred almost

1219
01:45:00.42 --> 01:45:08.98
2000 you know academic papers and articles and essays and diaries and things like I just I read

1220
01:45:08.98 --> 01:45:15.14
almost everything that I could find on it to a point where I would get a new book and I would read it

1221
01:45:15.14 --> 01:45:20.58
or a new paper and I would read it and I would be glad if I would get like one more little tidbit out of that

1222
01:45:21.22 --> 01:45:26.74
and so I felt pretty good about that series when it was finished and a lot of people you know

1223
01:45:26.74 --> 01:45:30.82
have enjoyed it obviously I'm glad I caught you early when you could still respond to emails

1224
01:45:31.86 --> 01:45:35.86
was that you that said me that I should listen to you I don't think it was I don't think so

1225
01:45:35.86 --> 01:45:40.02
I don't think it was I think it was somebody else which is pretty random because

1226
01:45:40.02 --> 01:45:48.66
uh I mean at that time I know when we started this podcast 18 I saw this figure 18% of

1227
01:45:48.66 --> 01:45:54.50
America was listening to podcasts so you were before that so maybe it was 15 or 12% of people

1228
01:45:54.50 --> 01:46:00.42
for so for somebody of two have heard your podcast and then my podcast and then connect us on social

1229
01:46:00.42 --> 01:46:05.22
media that's pretty freaking impressive and it was you know I never expect anybody to listen to it

1230
01:46:05.22 --> 01:46:10.34
like I didn't just never I'm not an authority on anything I don't have any credentials you know

1231
01:46:10.34 --> 01:46:17.14
or anything and I it just I it never occurred me and it was gonna was gonna be listening to it and um it was

1232
01:46:18.50 --> 01:46:22.50
yeah it was a lot to handle when people started listening to it and start writing me emails I've got

1233
01:46:22.50 --> 01:46:29.54
an emails from from Israeli Defense Force active duty guys running patrols in the last bank

1234
01:46:29.54 --> 01:46:35.46
who have written me and said that like this maybe sympathize with the Palestinians more right that's

1235
01:46:35.46 --> 01:46:40.82
it dude who that matters that's a guy who like is gonna be dealing with these people tomorrow on

1236
01:46:40.82 --> 01:46:46.10
patrol and I've gotten emails from people from Arabs Muslims all over the Middle East who said

1237
01:46:46.10 --> 01:46:50.74
I never I never thought about the situation that the Jews were in in that way before and I'm like

1238
01:46:51.94 --> 01:46:56.50
it's a it feels like it's a pretty heavy responsibility but at the same time like it's you know

1239
01:46:56.50 --> 01:47:02.02
it makes it so that like you really feel like okay I got to I got to make sure that I'm

1240
01:47:02.98 --> 01:47:07.62
saying things that I mean and then I'm putting the amount of work in this that it deserves so one of the

1241
01:47:07.62 --> 01:47:12.98
things that I I do that my one of my recent ones took a long time the Jim Jones one that I'm doing

1242
01:47:13.62 --> 01:47:23.06
because I just I refuse to put out an episode until I feel like I can at least have a glance of

1243
01:47:23.06 --> 01:47:27.86
what it would be like to put myself in the shoes of the people that I'm talking about and if I just

1244
01:47:27.86 --> 01:47:33.46
if there's people in there that I'm gonna be talking about who I just don't like or who I just have

1245
01:47:33.46 --> 01:47:37.54
can tempt form and sort of a cartoonish way which is how I felt about a lot of the people in

1246
01:47:37.54 --> 01:47:42.02
Jim Jones' movement for a while I just don't like these people they just elicit nothing but

1247
01:47:42.02 --> 01:47:47.94
negative emotions in me and I just refuse to make the episode until I could get through that you know

1248
01:47:47.94 --> 01:47:53.70
and try to figure out what are the circumstances that these people could be looking at that could

1249
01:47:53.70 --> 01:48:00.02
make the decisions that they're making make sense to them at the time and you know that can be really

1250
01:48:00.02 --> 01:48:07.22
hard to do like you know I've been reading a whole lot about how I'll cut in a rack and all that

1251
01:48:07.22 --> 01:48:11.54
stuff now and I that's I mean that's I don't know if I'm gonna get through that one you know and

1252
01:48:11.54 --> 01:48:16.74
read about Zarkali and some of these guys where it's just this is you know it's another level of

1253
01:48:16.74 --> 01:48:23.46
sadism yeah and I don't I don't feel like I need to get to a point where I can you know where I can

1254
01:48:23.46 --> 01:48:28.90
empathize with them before I can talk about it but I do at least one understand like the social

1255
01:48:28.90 --> 01:48:37.30
conditions in ideological you know parameters that that's structure somebody's thinking in a way that

1256
01:48:37.30 --> 01:48:42.90
that you know leads them to think that that's a course of action that makes sense you know yeah

1257
01:48:42.90 --> 01:48:48.34
you obviously must be seeing connections between Jim Jones and just the cult mentality go you

1258
01:48:49.06 --> 01:48:54.02
yeah because that's essentially what what you're dealing with and what you said earlier about you know

1259
01:48:54.02 --> 01:48:57.78
when you're young and you don't really know which direction to take and then all of a sudden somebody

1260
01:48:57.78 --> 01:49:02.26
shows up that you know like we've been saying the whole time you you also know the rules the game

1261
01:49:02.26 --> 01:49:07.62
well when somebody shows up and says hey I got the rules for the game here they are and this is what

1262
01:49:07.62 --> 01:49:14.74
you need to do to win yeah then it becomes a very easy to kind of sweet people into it and they

1263
01:49:14.74 --> 01:49:19.70
offer I mean I think one of the biggest things is they offer people an identity you know identity

1264
01:49:19.70 --> 01:49:26.02
something that in some ways we're not really comfortable talking about in in society these days we

1265
01:49:26.02 --> 01:49:31.78
find it to be kind of dangerous social identity the way people the ways that people tend to

1266
01:49:32.66 --> 01:49:37.30
connect themselves with larger groups and and movements it's something that we look at as

1267
01:49:37.30 --> 01:49:42.42
pretty dangerous for pretty for pretty reasonable you know we have reasons for that right we look

1268
01:49:42.42 --> 01:49:48.34
back at something like World War II and we see how you know a group of people starting to get really

1269
01:49:48.34 --> 01:49:54.10
really serious about who we are and our identity can really go off the rails right not you say what

1270
01:49:54.10 --> 01:49:58.66
uncomfortable talking about that but I mean there's another side okay I was gonna say because we've got

1271
01:49:58.66 --> 01:50:04.50
like people whose number one thing in life is the identity with whatever group it is right and so it's

1272
01:50:04.50 --> 01:50:10.10
it let's say maybe not that we're uncomfortable with it but did it something that is volatile you know

1273
01:50:10.10 --> 01:50:15.22
and when we do talk about it it's usually charged with a lot of emotion one way or the other

1274
01:50:16.10 --> 01:50:23.22
and so rather than and it's usually attached to you know ideas of historical grievance and

1275
01:50:23.22 --> 01:50:28.66
things like that so we'll say that you know a group that has some has some grievance they it's okay

1276
01:50:28.66 --> 01:50:36.82
for them to sort of identify in a group manner things like that but rather than just talking about

1277
01:50:36.82 --> 01:50:45.06
it as a psychological need that people have I mean when you come up as a kid like I did where you know

1278
01:50:45.06 --> 01:50:49.78
you're just you're just kind of pasting an identity together out of random bits people that

1279
01:50:49.78 --> 01:50:54.98
pass through your life of things you see on TV book you read you're just kind of pasting

1280
01:50:54.98 --> 01:50:59.46
something together it's not like you know a good strong nuclear families a little cocoon where you can

1281
01:50:59.46 --> 01:51:03.86
start to develop emulate your parents ideally if there's somebody that you want to emulate and kind of

1282
01:51:04.50 --> 01:51:10.42
figure out you know where where there's room for your own individuation and so forth but we don't have that

1283
01:51:11.06 --> 01:51:15.78
you're kind of just pasting something together and you grew up in the idea of like who am I or who are we as

1284
01:51:15.78 --> 01:51:20.98
a people and you can one of the early Israel Palestine ones when I was kind of talk about how

1285
01:51:20.98 --> 01:51:27.06
you know the Zionists are pulling people from all over Jews from all over Europe and trying to get

1286
01:51:27.06 --> 01:51:31.06
them to think of themselves is like you know this is a time when like German Jews didn't really

1287
01:51:31.06 --> 01:51:35.54
like Polish Jews and American Jews kind of looked down all of them in certain ways and to pull

1288
01:51:35.54 --> 01:51:39.70
all these people together and be like no no no no this is us like this is who we are we're a people

1289
01:51:40.66 --> 01:51:47.46
and it takes it's a mysterious kind of alchemical process like how that works and it can come

1290
01:51:47.46 --> 01:51:52.90
apart really easily and I mentioned how what's the difference between you know what is it that makes

1291
01:51:52.90 --> 01:51:58.98
America you know you know where we say we don't just say this is America we say we're Americans right

1292
01:51:58.98 --> 01:52:04.18
and what's the difference between 300 million people who just happen to live near each other in the

1293
01:52:04.18 --> 01:52:09.46
middle of North America and this place called America with people who are Americans you can

1294
01:52:09.46 --> 01:52:14.74
cooperate and trust each other in various ways that allow us to sort of live next sort of total

1295
01:52:14.74 --> 01:52:18.82
strangers without killing each other which we think of it's like well why would we kill each other

1296
01:52:18.82 --> 01:52:22.66
it's like we'll go try that in most of history if those people weren't members of your tribe you're

1297
01:52:22.66 --> 01:52:31.06
not living next door to them you know I have a Palestinian friend who several years ago we were

1298
01:52:31.06 --> 01:52:36.74
down in a place in LA having having lunch or breakfast or something Sunday morning beautiful

1299
01:52:36.74 --> 01:52:42.50
day and we're you know sitting out on the patio and there's just a bunch of people it's a

1300
01:52:42.50 --> 01:52:47.54
wonderful little little meal and all of a sudden I catch you just kind of looking around and

1301
01:52:48.82 --> 01:52:53.14
I say what's on your mind what are you thinking about and she said this place she's from the

1302
01:52:53.14 --> 01:52:59.14
Middle East right she says this place like here this could never happen in my country and I just

1303
01:52:59.14 --> 01:53:04.42
kind of looked around and yeah sure enough like over here you've got at this table like you know

1304
01:53:04.82 --> 01:53:09.78
to white people to black people having a meal together over here you've got like two gay dudes

1305
01:53:09.78 --> 01:53:14.90
having breakfast together just all different types of people they don't know each other they're not

1306
01:53:14.90 --> 01:53:21.62
related to each other um and they're just they're all good it's all good it's totally stable and totally

1307
01:53:21.62 --> 01:53:27.14
normal and if anybody fell down people would go to see what was wrong with them and you know it's

1308
01:53:27.14 --> 01:53:31.22
not that people don't care about each other in other parts of the world it's at their you know

1309
01:53:31.22 --> 01:53:36.90
their level of trust for people outside their group and what is defined as us is something that's

1310
01:53:36.90 --> 01:53:43.62
typically a lot narrower you know I'm sure this is uh we'll talk about this in a future time when we

1311
01:53:43.62 --> 01:53:48.66
get into when you had to talk to the sheaks and Romadi and stuff we had to work through you had to

1312
01:53:48.66 --> 01:53:52.74
work through it a whole tribal system that plays no role over here you know we just don't have anything

1313
01:53:52.74 --> 01:53:57.86
like that over here and when we when we have like little versions of it with like uh you know

1314
01:53:57.86 --> 01:54:02.74
um say like the Italian mafia back in the day or something where there's still this sort of

1315
01:54:02.74 --> 01:54:08.10
in group mentality and stuff that starts to it's hard to keep that together in the United States and

1316
01:54:08.10 --> 01:54:13.78
a lot of the institutions we have are kind of designed to break down those subloilties so that you know

1317
01:54:13.78 --> 01:54:18.26
there's this broader national loyalty that we all kind of devote ourselves to you know the half

1318
01:54:18.26 --> 01:54:24.10
fields and McCoyes have to figure out how to uh how to you know how to put their differences aside

1319
01:54:24.10 --> 01:54:28.18
and get on the same landing craft and go storm the beaches in Normandy you know they got to figure

1320
01:54:28.18 --> 01:54:32.50
how to do that and we take that kind of stuff for granted because we're so far along that process

1321
01:54:32.50 --> 01:54:36.66
here but you know you go to a lot of the world and it's not something you can take for granted at all

1322
01:54:37.38 --> 01:54:45.70
and I think that um how I grew up kind of um it it it it it it it it it pushed me in the direction

1323
01:54:45.70 --> 01:54:50.90
of being interested in those kind of things you know um wanting to belong to something trying to

1324
01:54:50.90 --> 01:54:58.18
figure out um what makes a community work or what makes a family work or what makes a country work

1325
01:54:58.18 --> 01:55:02.26
as opposed to one that just doesn't work what's different so not better people over here

1326
01:55:02.26 --> 01:55:08.98
than they are over here they're just they you know um there's little thing you know do you trust

1327
01:55:08.98 --> 01:55:17.38
your neighbors um you know do you uh just have you know are your concentric circles of concern

1328
01:55:17.94 --> 01:55:22.58
sort of expanded enough to the you know where they get to the point uh that they include people

1329
01:55:22.58 --> 01:55:29.22
that maybe you don't know but that you still consider at least relative to somebody way over there like

1330
01:55:29.22 --> 01:55:34.82
one of us you know and where does that where do those circles of concern end you know do they

1331
01:55:34.82 --> 01:55:38.42
end at the tribe well you're never you're never a hell of a time trying to put together like a

1332
01:55:38.42 --> 01:55:44.58
functioning nation state if that's the problem if that's if that's the case you know you and um you know

1333
01:55:44.58 --> 01:55:49.62
if it ends it a lot of people it ends at themselves you know and um I don't think people generally

1334
01:55:49.62 --> 01:55:54.34
want to be that way though I think they want people and and uh something to identify with into

1335
01:55:54.34 --> 01:56:02.26
a long too and to kind of hand themselves over to most people I think most people um um they uh

1336
01:56:02.58 --> 01:56:09.62
they long for something to serve and something to give themselves to but they look around and you know

1337
01:56:09.62 --> 01:56:14.26
um they just again they're waiting for something that beam of sunlight to shine down on it and just

1338
01:56:14.26 --> 01:56:20.42
this is the thing and that's usually never gonna happen and uh but I think that's what people are

1339
01:56:20.42 --> 01:56:27.46
seeking you know I think people want to sacrifice I think people want to serve something and um um

1340
01:56:27.78 --> 01:56:31.54
you know they spend their lives looking for something and we're maybe not looking hard enough maybe

1341
01:56:31.54 --> 01:56:36.02
that's the wrong way to look at they want it but they don't necessarily go looking for it and it's

1342
01:56:36.02 --> 01:56:44.34
uh it's interesting times it's interesting times because you can kind of get by without being

1343
01:56:44.34 --> 01:56:48.10
linked into something and so everyone can kind of get by without being linked into something but

1344
01:56:48.10 --> 01:56:53.14
then they have a certain void of being linked into something and then you know it's like when you

1345
01:56:53.14 --> 01:56:57.94
go to prison like when you go to prison you're gonna join a gang but you know pretty much you're

1346
01:56:57.94 --> 01:57:01.54
gonna join a gang that's what's gonna happen if you're gonna survive period like that's what's

1347
01:57:01.54 --> 01:57:06.74
happening you're gonna you know and it's gonna be by race that's what's gonna happen and then you'll

1348
01:57:06.74 --> 01:57:13.62
get out and it's like it's okay you know like that's uh that's a really interesting microcosm

1349
01:57:13.62 --> 01:57:18.82
to look at but and there you need to do it to survive so all of a sudden you get in there and next thing

1350
01:57:18.82 --> 01:57:23.46
you know you're getting bolts tattooed on your neck because you're you know you're going a b that's the

1351
01:57:23.46 --> 01:57:30.74
way it's gonna be the the the the thing is now all of a sudden you're part of a group well in the

1352
01:57:30.74 --> 01:57:36.34
in the civilian world you don't have to be a part of anything to survive so you have some kind of

1353
01:57:36.34 --> 01:57:44.58
you have some kind of a void right or I say it is possible that people have some kind of a void

1354
01:57:44.58 --> 01:57:51.94
where they are looking to be a part of something and that's why you know you get whether it's you know

1355
01:57:51.94 --> 01:57:57.86
ISIS jihadists and by the way those are people some of those ISIS jihadists leaving normal

1356
01:57:58.42 --> 01:58:04.74
you know first world countries to go and be part of a death cult you know that's why you get

1357
01:58:04.74 --> 01:58:09.54
jammed jones that's why you get these things unfolding because there's some kind of a void that

1358
01:58:09.54 --> 01:58:14.66
people have when they want to be connected to other people and they can't figure it out and when the

1359
01:58:14.66 --> 01:58:19.62
when they when that light gets shine down well it's a light that's getting shine down by a bad

1360
01:58:19.62 --> 01:58:24.66
person's there was an interview I saw I never forget they were interviewing one of the guys who had

1361
01:58:24.66 --> 01:58:29.70
gone from Belgium perfectly nice life in Belgium to go join ISIS and they asked him why he did it and he said

1362
01:58:29.70 --> 01:58:36.50
Belgium is boring and I think to a lot of people well I think to a lot of people on one hand that

1363
01:58:36.50 --> 01:58:41.14
makes no sense to them but I think on on the other hand there's this deep recess where it

1364
01:58:41.14 --> 01:58:45.78
makes some sense to them I think people do understand to some degree it's like when you know it's

1365
01:58:45.78 --> 01:58:50.74
like when you remember when sometimes you could live on a dirt road maybe so I got to know if you

1366
01:58:50.74 --> 01:58:55.06
had direct neighbors but like the power would go out right and the power would go out and people would

1367
01:58:55.06 --> 01:58:59.46
walk out like on their front lawns and kind of look around like whoa you almost have this sense of

1368
01:58:59.46 --> 01:59:03.78
connectedness with your neighbors that you don't have on a normal day you know because everything

1369
01:59:03.78 --> 01:59:07.38
kind of shuts in you kind of realize like whoa we're just here together like at this point wonder what's

1370
01:59:07.38 --> 01:59:11.78
gonna happen and it's kind of cool yeah you know you have enjoyed I've been through plenty of power

1371
01:59:11.78 --> 01:59:17.70
outlets now out out of just now in the California and you're right power goes out people are like oh

1372
01:59:17.70 --> 01:59:22.74
let's walk out especially I used to live on one street in O.B. where it was like a it was a real

1373
01:59:22.74 --> 01:59:28.90
neighborhood street you know a lot of families and all of our kids play together and the power went out

1374
01:59:28.90 --> 01:59:35.38
news like 30 seconds later everyone's out the front yard looking around and what's going on yeah absolutely

1375
01:59:35.38 --> 01:59:40.58
and so I think there is something where our societies can become so overcoded and so structured

1376
01:59:40.58 --> 01:59:46.74
that people people think they long for some instability but you know that happens in countries where

1377
01:59:46.74 --> 01:59:53.14
people don't know what instability is yeah you know and when it when it comes to like being part of a

1378
01:59:53.14 --> 02:00:03.38
group and again for me going into the seal teams was me absolutely trying to become or what or

1379
02:00:04.34 --> 02:00:08.42
trying to become part of a group and then being part of that group and knowing what I had to do

1380
02:00:08.42 --> 02:00:16.18
to be a better part of that group and and you know going back to your earlier behavior which I was

1381
02:00:16.18 --> 02:00:22.50
saying was so you know I can picture it I know it and I and I did it you know I was one of those guys

1382
02:00:22.50 --> 02:00:28.82
too you know I was one of those kids when I was young you know I wanted to kind of test the patience

1383
02:00:30.02 --> 02:00:33.78
of my boss especially if my boss was a person you know whether it was my chief or my

1384
02:00:33.78 --> 02:00:40.42
L.P. or my Ptune commander or my you know if they weren't quite the the respected individual

1385
02:00:40.66 --> 02:00:48.50
then I would absolutely push buttons the the big differences in the teams there's a way to deal with it

1386
02:00:48.50 --> 02:00:55.54
really directly like you're gonna get tightened up and you're gonna realize and the thing that they

1387
02:00:55.54 --> 02:01:00.50
put on you is like oh you oh you eventually it goes from hey even if let's say no one respects

1388
02:01:00.50 --> 02:01:04.82
the chief or no one respects the L.P. or whatever eventually someone's gonna say amen that's the

1389
02:01:04.82 --> 02:01:11.62
Ptune chief I remember someone saying that to me no no no wait I take that back I said that to someone

1390
02:01:11.62 --> 02:01:20.82
I said I said that's the Ptune L.P. and I said it as if are you absolutely insane like you

1391
02:01:20.82 --> 02:01:28.34
don't talk back to the seal platoon leading petty officer I don't care that just don't want that

1392
02:01:28.34 --> 02:01:33.62
that will never happen again am I making myself clear that's E5 Mafia scenario right there

1393
02:01:34.42 --> 02:01:39.86
that's E5 Mafia scenario so the other thing and I just I know we're gonna wrap up here

1394
02:01:39.86 --> 02:01:47.22
you're a straight up what is it auto die-dact yeah straight up auto die-dact of the first order

1395
02:01:48.02 --> 02:01:55.46
like what is a auto die-dact teacher self-taught self-taught you know what did you did you

1396
02:01:55.46 --> 02:01:59.06
go to college at some point now I went for a little while and like I said I didn't know what I

1397
02:01:59.06 --> 02:02:02.98
wanted to major and I was gonna go into the Navy as after post high school yeah right after I went

1398
02:02:02.98 --> 02:02:08.02
for a year but I just kind of took some classes did fine but didn't know where I was going with it so

1399
02:02:08.02 --> 02:02:13.78
moved on and you and so you you're self-educated everything that you talk about which is

1400
02:02:14.66 --> 02:02:20.82
vast you know I get I get emails from people who want to start podcasts all the time and they say

1401
02:02:21.38 --> 02:02:24.98
you know I want to start a history podcast or this kind of podcast there are any like tips you can

1402
02:02:24.98 --> 02:02:30.58
give me I know I could never do one like yours but and I tell these people like I'm smart enough right

1403
02:02:30.58 --> 02:02:33.94
I'm smart enough that if you're explaining something to me I'll be able to understand what you're

1404
02:02:33.94 --> 02:02:41.14
talking about I'm not some genius I just pound away on it every day like if I'm not happy with something

1405
02:02:41.14 --> 02:02:45.30
like I tell them if the fact that you like my podcast and that you're understanding and getting down

1406
02:02:45.30 --> 02:02:49.62
with like the concepts that I'm talking about shows you that you can work with these concepts everything

1407
02:02:49.62 --> 02:02:53.86
that I'm talking about you're capable of talking about it's just a matter of like putting the

1408
02:02:53.86 --> 02:02:59.78
work in and getting it done and showing up every day and grinding and that's how I get my podcast

1409
02:02:59.78 --> 02:03:04.18
done you know I don't I don't just whip these things out like I got a my genius brain or anything like

1410
02:03:04.18 --> 02:03:08.98
that you know I just pound away on them are you a fast reader no not really I'm like a I'm not

1411
02:03:08.98 --> 02:03:14.02
like a medium average because I when I'm reading something I tend to get in character you know so I'll

1412
02:03:14.02 --> 02:03:20.10
kind of read like in like if I'm reading a novel I'll literally be doing the voices in my head but

1413
02:03:20.10 --> 02:03:25.30
even if I'm reading a if I'm reading one of your books like it's your voice at your pace

1414
02:03:25.30 --> 02:03:32.58
yeah speaking in my head and so so it's not exactly the speed read I'm the worst I read books

1415
02:03:32.58 --> 02:03:38.42
which I have to do all the time and I'm reading at the pace that I basically talk okay maybe not

1416
02:03:38.42 --> 02:03:44.82
as bad I mean I get it when I read when I talk a lot of times I talk slowly and a lot of times I

1417
02:03:44.82 --> 02:03:52.58
have some pauses we'll say sure pauses pauses I don't have those pauses when I read but

1418
02:03:52.58 --> 02:03:58.66
man I don't read as fast as I wish I I just read all the time I probably read for the last gosh

1419
02:03:58.66 --> 02:04:03.94
for the last 20 years I've probably read six hours a day I read all the time you read six hours

1420
02:04:03.94 --> 02:04:10.26
a day I would say probably cumulatively yeah like I mean I read if I have if I'm if I'm at work

1421
02:04:10.26 --> 02:04:14.66
waiting for a meeting to start and take in 15 minutes and I'm reading my book getting some time in

1422
02:04:15.38 --> 02:04:21.46
you know are you paper books or are you digital books both you know I travel a lot for work and so

1423
02:04:21.46 --> 02:04:25.70
if I can get it on Kindle sometimes I will I prefer paper but a lot of the stuff that I read

1424
02:04:25.70 --> 02:04:31.06
is not available digitally so I just have to order some old ass book you know like um that

1425
02:04:31.06 --> 02:04:36.18
Amazon doesn't sell anymore it's coming from some other seller or something when uh yeah I've got

1426
02:04:36.18 --> 02:04:39.78
I've got a pretty interesting library I how many books do you think you have in your library?

1427
02:04:39.78 --> 02:04:44.58
Last time I moved because this is this is the worst part is when you got to move and you got a

1428
02:04:44.58 --> 02:04:53.06
big stack of books um last time I moved I gave away about 600 and I would say I probably have about

1429
02:04:53.06 --> 02:04:59.30
three or four thousand left and and when I get more room I'm gonna have more like I just you know

1430
02:04:59.30 --> 02:05:03.94
and I've I'd say I've read like 70% of them and I'll you know some of them I've got for reference

1431
02:05:03.94 --> 02:05:09.30
but um I've got this fantasy where one day when I've got a kid you know I'm gonna have this room

1432
02:05:09.30 --> 02:05:13.78
it's just gonna be wall the wall books and there's gonna be books kind of that are more adult

1433
02:05:13.78 --> 02:05:17.38
level that are gonna be higher up that they can't reach and when they want to like give me that

1434
02:05:17.38 --> 02:05:20.50
both of them they'll be like no you know when you're old enough to reach it you can read it

1435
02:05:20.50 --> 02:05:25.30
and just make it this place so that you know there was no kind of I wasn't in any kind of

1436
02:05:26.02 --> 02:05:30.26
intellectual environment or anything like that when I was a kid and so to have like one of my

1437
02:05:30.26 --> 02:05:34.90
kids uh to be able to go into a room like that and just it's normal that there's like a room full of

1438
02:05:34.90 --> 02:05:39.94
books and you can pick one up and there's so much stuff in it that's like my fantasy and so um I

1439
02:05:39.94 --> 02:05:44.34
get rid of books that I I think I can probably get again really easily you know if I read it

1440
02:05:44.34 --> 02:05:47.94
I don't think I have a copy of Moby Dick if I want to get one I can get it for $2 on Amazon

1441
02:05:47.94 --> 02:05:55.94
I keep the ones that are gonna be kind of a pain to get again and um yeah I love having them around

1442
02:05:56.34 --> 02:06:00.34
that makes sense though with the six hours a day especially if you're into reading

1443
02:06:00.34 --> 02:06:05.54
because like you know consider how you bust out your phone like anytime there's dead space

1444
02:06:05.54 --> 02:06:12.02
in your day most of us are like bossing on our phone checking is checking that you know but

1445
02:06:12.02 --> 02:06:15.86
if your mind is all automatic like let me let me get back to that book or whatever

1446
02:06:16.90 --> 02:06:20.66
oh yeah you'd be reading all the time especially if you're actively like doing that like that's what

1447
02:06:20.66 --> 02:06:24.98
you're into you know so you and that's and so that'll be in addition to the time that you

1448
02:06:25.70 --> 02:06:29.94
designate to read or habitually you know a lot of people you know they get those

1449
02:06:30.58 --> 02:06:34.02
time trackers so their phones and see how much time they spend on their phone and there's been

1450
02:06:34.02 --> 02:06:37.78
in several hours a day and you know if instead you're just pulling out your book and getting a

1451
02:06:37.78 --> 02:06:42.90
couple more pages in yeah it adds up no I'll read for a few hours in the evening you highlight

1452
02:06:44.74 --> 02:06:51.62
it depends so I'll highlight books that I've already read but if I'm reading it for the first time

1453
02:06:51.62 --> 02:06:55.62
then I don't do anything like that what I'll do I used to do that and then I realized I wasn't

1454
02:06:55.62 --> 02:07:01.62
retaining stuff nearly as well I was building an external structure you know for me to you know be

1455
02:07:01.62 --> 02:07:05.78
able to reference things but I this wasn't retaining as well so the first time I read a book I'll

1456
02:07:05.78 --> 02:07:11.70
usually read a section or a chapter and then I'll stop and I'll just write something up about it

1457
02:07:11.70 --> 02:07:16.10
and that'll kind of hammer it into place in my head and then I'll read the next section

1458
02:07:16.10 --> 02:07:19.86
and keep doing that and then when you know maybe I'm putting together a podcast episode I'll go

1459
02:07:19.86 --> 02:07:24.18
back to books I've already read and then I'm highlighting and underlining and marking of how

1460
02:07:24.18 --> 02:07:29.62
do you organize your books so that you can find them I mean when you've got what do you say 3,000

1461
02:07:29.62 --> 02:07:35.62
books you almost need to go do e-despairs right now it's just serious because this bothers

1462
02:07:35.62 --> 02:07:40.74
like with me I'll be doing a podcast about World War or whatever World War one and I'll be like

1463
02:07:40.74 --> 02:07:46.02
oh there's this one part in this one book and I want to intro with this and I'll be like now I

1464
02:07:46.02 --> 02:07:50.42
have to go find it and I don't know how many books I have I don't have 3,000 but I have enough

1465
02:07:51.38 --> 02:07:58.10
that they're in multiple locations double stacked and it just it drives I got to figure out the

1466
02:07:58.10 --> 02:08:03.30
do-e-dit decimal system for my house cause it gets crazy. I spent a lot of time around my

1467
02:08:03.30 --> 02:08:09.62
books so I kind of know where they're all at. I you know sometimes I'll just when I'm waiting

1468
02:08:09.62 --> 02:08:15.14
I'm letting the thoughts do in my head I don't want to read anything necessarily to like put it

1469
02:08:15.14 --> 02:08:19.30
out or maybe it's a half form thought that I'm kind of waiting for it to come together looking

1470
02:08:19.30 --> 02:08:23.54
for something to kind of attach it to I'll just kind of walk around and look at my books and pull

1471
02:08:23.54 --> 02:08:27.38
one out and flip through it and put it back so I kind of know where everything is just it's like

1472
02:08:27.38 --> 02:08:31.54
that that's my world the books are like kind of ever since I've been a kid like that's been

1473
02:08:31.54 --> 02:08:37.22
my world sort of so it's like my primary point of reference in a lot of ways and what about um like

1474
02:08:37.22 --> 02:08:43.94
just diving around on the internet how how do you discriminate when you Google search you know

1475
02:08:43.94 --> 02:08:50.82
whatever how do you have any good methodology for saying because I like I'll be I'll go down the

1476
02:08:50.82 --> 02:08:54.90
rabbit hole you know and I guess some people I mean I guess everyone goes down the rabbit

1477
02:08:54.90 --> 02:09:02.50
hole sometimes on the internet but I go deep on the internet and it's hard to discriminate like

1478
02:09:02.50 --> 02:09:08.98
okay should I click this link or not do you have any advice? No I'm not good at it I have to um

1479
02:09:08.98 --> 02:09:14.90
I have to be very very I have to be a fascist when it comes to controlling my internet usage because

1480
02:09:14.90 --> 02:09:21.46
I don't to me it's like you know it's not like I don't I'm I don't I'm not like addicted to it

1481
02:09:21.46 --> 02:09:25.38
or anything but I don't I don't know how to like structure my usage once I get in there and I start

1482
02:09:25.38 --> 02:09:30.26
clicking things there's always enough click and I just I will end up where oh it's been three hours

1483
02:09:30.26 --> 02:09:35.54
that I've been on my phone today so I like until recently I didn't have a I didn't have a smartphone

1484
02:09:35.54 --> 02:09:40.26
I just had a normal flip phone just until recently and like literally like a couple weeks ago

1485
02:09:40.82 --> 02:09:44.90
and it was just because I just don't want that I just didn't want it my life I don't want it anywhere near me

1486
02:09:44.90 --> 02:09:51.94
I just you know it's yeah I don't want to get on that cliche topic but like when you see a family

1487
02:09:51.94 --> 02:09:57.38
sitting at a table and everyone's on their phones I just can't deal with it I grew up in a house

1488
02:09:57.38 --> 02:10:02.18
with no dining room table you know where everybody just kind of did their own thing and like so

1489
02:10:02.82 --> 02:10:06.74
just when people aren't paying attention to each other and aren't being there together with one another

1490
02:10:06.74 --> 02:10:12.98
it just it turns me off and and I find man I'll tell you one thing there is nothing that makes me

1491
02:10:12.98 --> 02:10:19.54
that that deteriorates my my mind like my ability to recall and structure thoughts and sit still

1492
02:10:19.54 --> 02:10:24.34
and contemplate something more than if I spend a bunch of time on the internet especially on the phone

1493
02:10:24.74 --> 02:10:30.50
like if I like I had a smartphone back in the day and I would fart around on it sometimes

1494
02:10:30.50 --> 02:10:34.42
so maybe I'm reading articles or whatever but just something about the way that the information

1495
02:10:34.42 --> 02:10:38.58
is coming at me I would put the thing down and for the rest of the day I would be much harder to

1496
02:10:38.58 --> 02:10:43.94
sit down and actually read a book for like a long period of time I got rid of that thing a week or two

1497
02:10:43.94 --> 02:10:48.82
later I could just sit down again read for three four hours of a time like I was a kid again and

1498
02:10:48.82 --> 02:10:53.30
yeah there's something about them that again it might be a disciplined thing you have to figure out

1499
02:10:53.30 --> 02:10:57.94
a structure through right away but I don't know I don't have any tips. When I went to college I was

1500
02:10:57.94 --> 02:11:01.94
in English major and there were times on the weekends where and one one semester I took five

1501
02:11:01.94 --> 02:11:06.98
English classes and it was really dumb and I should have never done it because I would spend you

1502
02:11:06.98 --> 02:11:11.54
know like eight to ten hours reading on Saturday and then eight to ten hours reading on Sunday

1503
02:11:11.54 --> 02:11:20.34
I actually hurt my eyes for a while it was it was crazy but I did not did not like it I did not

1504
02:11:20.34 --> 02:11:24.50
like it like reading sitting down reading for six hours for me and then sometimes I still have to

1505
02:11:24.50 --> 02:11:29.54
do it because because of the podcast you know it's like okay we're doing a podcast it's on this book

1506
02:11:29.54 --> 02:11:38.02
we're doing it in you know four days and you know there's almost never been a point with this podcast

1507
02:11:38.02 --> 02:11:46.50
where it's like oh don't worry we don't have a podcast do you know you and and Dan Carlin

1508
02:11:46.50 --> 02:11:52.50
who are like oh I'll put it out of podcast whenever I'm damn well ready that's you know a

1509
02:11:52.50 --> 02:11:56.42
luxury that I don't have I'm putting this thing out and so I've had to read books

1510
02:11:56.42 --> 02:12:03.14
you know read really long books for me and you know it's a you know two ten hours days and I just

1511
02:12:03.14 --> 02:12:09.70
I'm not happy and it is what it is because you know you kind of owe it sometimes it's work and

1512
02:12:10.98 --> 02:12:16.82
I kind of benefit a little bit because of the way I structure my reading I usually I don't just pick a book

1513
02:12:16.82 --> 02:12:23.22
that sounds cool on a topic and pick it up and read it usually I'll study a particular topic right

1514
02:12:23.22 --> 02:12:29.06
and I'll start diving really deep into it and the books that I read are sort of hanging ornaments

1515
02:12:29.06 --> 02:12:34.26
on that tree and adding little pieces to that puzzle and then as I'm doing that on that topic

1516
02:12:36.26 --> 02:12:40.18
I'll start to have questions that are outside that topic right I start reading a lot about gym

1517
02:12:40.18 --> 02:12:45.70
Jones and people's temple and then you want to know more about the 1960s and like that you know

1518
02:12:45.70 --> 02:12:51.46
the movements that this is coming out of and so I'm starting to you know accrue all these questions

1519
02:12:51.46 --> 02:12:56.58
that are kind of tangential to the topic at hand and I'm putting them there and once I've kind of you know

1520
02:12:56.58 --> 02:13:01.54
pretty soon I get to the point where now I'm getting impatient to go over to this other topic and move on to that

1521
02:13:01.54 --> 02:13:05.14
or maybe there's several topics and so I'll wrap this up and then I'll go over there and I'm already

1522
02:13:05.14 --> 02:13:10.42
excited about this and moving into that area and I've already got questions that now these books are answering and so

1523
02:13:10.82 --> 02:13:15.30
it's like a path that I'm following you know it's not sort of just random you know randomness

1524
02:13:15.30 --> 02:13:25.22
yeah the arc of the current episodes of Margar made the arc so it's about gym Jones but man

1525
02:13:26.26 --> 02:13:34.26
you are going deep and solid like I've explained I was explaining it to like my family

1526
02:13:35.38 --> 02:13:41.94
specifically I'm explaining to my my mom and dad over I guess it was over Christmas or something

1527
02:13:41.94 --> 02:13:46.26
but anyways I was like I was like explaining what the podcast was what it was about

1528
02:13:46.98 --> 02:13:52.50
and the path that you took and when you're talking about the black Panthers I mean you know

1529
02:13:52.50 --> 02:13:59.30
when you go from gym Jones and then that thread ties into the black Panthers it's pretty crazy and

1530
02:14:00.10 --> 02:14:06.82
you know what's his name Reverend Divine yeah Reverend the whole thing on Reverend Divine I mean it's

1531
02:14:06.82 --> 02:14:14.10
it's epic it's an epic tale and each one of them is just this thread that just gets pulled and pulled and

1532
02:14:14.10 --> 02:14:18.90
I mean I'm tracking you I'm tracking you I'm like oh I see where this is going okay oh we're

1533
02:14:18.90 --> 02:14:24.26
gonna open that door you know that door there it's wide open wide open and that's the thing that I

1534
02:14:24.26 --> 02:14:28.74
think is cool and I think that's what you know when I first started listening to Margar made I you know

1535
02:14:28.74 --> 02:14:35.14
since I read so much what I realized is I realized exactly what you were doing I realized I was like

1536
02:14:35.14 --> 02:14:40.02
okay every single one of those little foot notes every single because let's say I'm reading about

1537
02:14:40.02 --> 02:14:44.26
a battle right hey you know what I opened up with today what I opened up today I opened up with

1538
02:14:44.26 --> 02:14:50.34
about face for trepid a million times and I actually I actually talked about easy company

1539
02:14:51.94 --> 02:14:58.58
under the command of of desert area right and the first time I read this was probably

1540
02:14:59.30 --> 02:15:04.18
15 years ago I don't know how long it's a long time ago but what I do as I pulled the thread

1541
02:15:04.18 --> 02:15:08.82
because that's all it says it just says uh so did easy company under desert area in the fight

1542
02:15:08.82 --> 02:15:14.34
up on the hill up north that's what it says well who's who's that well that's a thread that

1543
02:15:14.34 --> 02:15:18.58
when I did when I was reading this section I was like oh I'm a pole in that well it turns out you

1544
02:15:18.58 --> 02:15:23.38
know army captain it turns out metal vana recipient turns out you can find out exactly what's

1545
02:15:23.38 --> 02:15:27.46
going on in that battle so when you start pulling these threads out it starts to turn into

1546
02:15:28.82 --> 02:15:33.94
a different level of knowledge and that's what I so even when I listen to your first series of

1547
02:15:33.94 --> 02:15:40.98
Margar made I realize exactly what you're doing I said oh every single time he comes across a little

1548
02:15:40.98 --> 02:15:46.50
a little hanging piece of information that's not closed he's gonna pull on that thread

1549
02:15:47.06 --> 02:15:50.34
until it gets called until he figures out where it leads to where it comes from what what the

1550
02:15:50.34 --> 02:15:56.90
situation is behind that and that's that's what you know that's what really impressed me with what

1551
02:15:56.90 --> 02:16:02.90
with with your podcast and that's why you know you and I are about to record some podcasts of

1552
02:16:02.90 --> 02:16:08.66
our own kind of going off on a on a tangent it's an idea that I had for a while which was

1553
02:16:10.42 --> 02:16:16.10
well it was this I talked about it on this podcast where I talked about the fact that and I was

1554
02:16:16.10 --> 02:16:22.74
I was complaining about the school system and the educational system in America and my biggest

1555
02:16:22.74 --> 02:16:26.98
complaint about the educational system in America well there's a bunch of different ones but my

1556
02:16:26.98 --> 02:16:34.66
biggest one is that when you learn you don't you don't get taught the context and the

1557
02:16:35.46 --> 02:16:39.78
listen everything that you learn is tied together everything every single thing you learn about

1558
02:16:39.78 --> 02:16:43.86
anything in human history is connected there's a thread that ties it all together there's a thread

1559
02:16:43.86 --> 02:16:48.50
that you can trace back and we never learn that thread and I don't care if you're talking about

1560
02:16:48.50 --> 02:16:55.22
learning mathematics or straight sciences or philosophy or English literature they're all connected

1561
02:16:55.22 --> 02:17:00.82
they're all connected and if you can connect those threads for me that's how I learn right

1562
02:17:00.82 --> 02:17:05.46
when I want to learn something I just don't want to learn the facts because that's just memorization

1563
02:17:06.02 --> 02:17:11.06
I want to actually understand what's behind them and that's where I think our educational

1564
02:17:11.06 --> 02:17:18.66
system sometimes falls short and then you transpose that onto our current news media which are

1565
02:17:18.66 --> 02:17:24.42
current news media what do they do there's no context or understanding it's a two-dimensional

1566
02:17:24.42 --> 02:17:31.30
picture of what's happening today and people don't understand the thread that connects all these things

1567
02:17:31.30 --> 02:17:38.10
how they tie together and that's why you know when I had this crazy idea of like hey wait a second

1568
02:17:38.58 --> 02:17:42.02
if I want to talk about things that are going on and I want to pull the thread on some of these

1569
02:17:42.02 --> 02:17:48.58
things I should get see if Darryl Cooper can come down and give me a hand with it so I guess

1570
02:17:48.58 --> 02:17:52.42
is that an announcement yeah we're going to make another few pot we're going to make a podcast we're

1571
02:17:52.42 --> 02:18:00.66
going to call the thread we're going to pull the thread on some things and well it'll be out

1572
02:18:01.06 --> 02:18:04.50
I think it'll be out yeah it'll be out when when you're listening to this podcast you'll be

1573
02:18:04.50 --> 02:18:10.58
able to listen to another podcast called the thread what else Darryl what do we miss

1574
02:18:12.98 --> 02:18:16.66
I think maybe the last thing I would I would talk about is um

1575
02:18:16.66 --> 02:18:22.66
has to with what you were just saying what's the thing that schools leave out is they teach

1576
02:18:22.66 --> 02:18:28.74
kids facts and they don't turn it into a story for them right and that's something that I think

1577
02:18:31.70 --> 02:18:35.78
when we talk earlier about people having purpose or goals or direction in their life

1578
02:18:37.78 --> 02:18:41.70
another way of saying that is that they're inhabiting a story right there's something in the

1579
02:18:41.70 --> 02:18:45.54
future that you're heading towards that means that you've got up again in middle and and you know

1580
02:18:45.54 --> 02:18:49.54
things like you're living in a story and a lot of people are not living in any kind of a story

1581
02:18:50.10 --> 02:18:54.50
a lot of people ask me why a name my podcast martyr me and my friend Danielle Ebelelli

1582
02:18:54.50 --> 02:18:59.94
who has helped me out a lot with it he uh he's got the thickest Italian accent anybody's ever heard

1583
02:18:59.94 --> 02:19:04.10
he cannot pronounce it for the life of him so every talk's better on his podcast people always

1584
02:19:04.10 --> 02:19:08.58
have to write him and ask him what it is and he tried to ask me early on you to change the name of this

1585
02:19:08.58 --> 02:19:17.38
podcast but I named it that for a reason right so I mentioned earlier at the beginning you asked me

1586
02:19:17.38 --> 02:19:26.26
how many sisters I had and I had two at the time I have one now and um my I had a sister in 2009

1587
02:19:26.26 --> 02:19:32.42
early 2009 that committed suicide me and my other sister my oldest sister two years younger than me

1588
02:19:32.42 --> 02:19:40.10
um she and I you know we we made it out right we came out of a pretty dark and difficult

1589
02:19:40.10 --> 02:19:46.10
situation we made it out she was up for homecoming queen her senior year and I was there at the

1590
02:19:46.58 --> 02:19:53.54
football game watching her and you know it was it was a really incredible in the moment just knowing

1591
02:19:53.54 --> 02:19:57.38
everything that she had been through and come out of to see that like that what's going on she was a

1592
02:19:57.38 --> 02:20:02.34
good water polo player she was popular at school you know she went on to college and doing very

1593
02:20:02.34 --> 02:20:09.86
well my youngest sister you know she didn't make it out she struggled she always struggled a little

1594
02:20:09.86 --> 02:20:15.70
bit more had things handled things a little bit more difficult had a little bit more difficult time

1595
02:20:16.58 --> 02:20:28.74
and and we lost her in 2009 and I had mentioned that my family when my mom was first having

1596
02:20:28.74 --> 02:20:33.54
me and my sisters was not really a family that was together she didn't have a lot of support

1597
02:20:34.50 --> 02:20:39.14
there's something that took time to kind of build up and uh people individual

1598
02:20:40.02 --> 02:20:44.34
branches of the family you know this aunt and uncle that aunt and uncle would start to get their

1599
02:20:44.58 --> 02:20:49.30
act together this one got their act together but we were never really like together as a family

1600
02:20:49.94 --> 02:20:53.94
and my mom as well she got her act together for last 20 years she's she's I'm very

1601
02:20:53.94 --> 02:20:59.06
very I couldn't be more proud of her she's been through a lot a lot more than I have and she

1602
02:20:59.06 --> 02:21:05.94
suffered more than I have for sure and you know she's doing very very well now she you know

1603
02:21:05.94 --> 02:21:11.38
manages a croaker grocery store and she's very into it she'll let go to war for like croaker grocery

1604
02:21:11.38 --> 02:21:16.50
stores and how they're better than you know Albert sins or whatever and very very proud of her

1605
02:21:16.50 --> 02:21:21.78
and so but we hadn't gotten to a point where all the different threads of the family had found their way

1606
02:21:21.78 --> 02:21:28.02
back together again right people kind of gotten their individual acts together but it was just like

1607
02:21:28.02 --> 02:21:32.74
long-term kind of animosity and little bickering that had accumulated over the years when people

1608
02:21:33.30 --> 02:21:39.94
you know we're not we're not sort of living living they're their best lives say that it accumulated and

1609
02:21:40.58 --> 02:21:49.46
my sister passed in 2009 and my family came together it was the first family reunion I think I

1610
02:21:49.46 --> 02:21:55.06
could ever really remember right it was my sister's funeral everybody came together for that and

1611
02:21:57.14 --> 02:22:03.94
at that time it was as if like that event it it's like everybody just kind of looked at each other

1612
02:22:03.94 --> 02:22:08.50
and realized it like whatever has happened in the past like none of that matters like we all

1613
02:22:09.30 --> 02:22:12.98
you know we're a family we need to look out for each other we all love each other and we need to

1614
02:22:12.98 --> 02:22:18.34
be a family again and you think about like what is the difference between

1615
02:22:18.34 --> 02:22:26.10
a martyr and a murder victim right it's just a story you're telling about right a martyr and just a

1616
02:22:26.10 --> 02:22:31.14
person who dies it's just you tell one story about one another story about another what's the

1617
02:22:31.14 --> 02:22:44.74
difference between you know it occurred to me that if my sister's death led to kind of the rebirth

1618
02:22:44.74 --> 02:22:49.78
of my family you know and it really has done that it's it's everybody now they're just happy

1619
02:22:49.78 --> 02:22:55.54
grandkids they're all playing together and it's just a beautiful thing that if that could come out of

1620
02:22:55.54 --> 02:23:02.74
that then you know her death could be turned into a sacrifice you know where something good could

1621
02:23:02.74 --> 02:23:08.18
come out of something that really just by itself is just a horrible thing you know my sister struggled

1622
02:23:08.18 --> 02:23:15.94
her whole life she never really had anybody who you know was kind of putting her first in the way

1623
02:23:15.94 --> 02:23:20.42
that you know like when when when the kids would get farmed out to different relatives and stuff I

1624
02:23:20.42 --> 02:23:25.06
would go somewhere my other sister Lindsay would go somewhere and it was kind of rewarding to have

1625
02:23:25.06 --> 02:23:29.30
us around you know we would do well in school and just like whatever it was it was some it was a

1626
02:23:29.30 --> 02:23:34.50
little bit rewarding my youngest sister she was just she was harder she had a temper she was just

1627
02:23:34.50 --> 02:23:40.18
kind of like a more wild personality it was kind of just more of a more of an ordeal than a

1628
02:23:42.74 --> 02:23:47.30
in less rewarding and so there'd be times where we get farmed out because things at home we're

1629
02:23:47.30 --> 02:23:53.06
starting to collapse you know really badly and Lindsay and I would go to one answer another and

1630
02:23:53.70 --> 02:23:57.86
we get split up in Jessica my youngest would stay with my mom and those are some pretty dark times

1631
02:23:57.86 --> 02:24:02.50
there's a reason we were getting farmed out during those periods and so she was always more attached

1632
02:24:02.50 --> 02:24:08.42
to my mom and Lindsay and I the two oldest we were always kind of we didn't intend this you know

1633
02:24:08.42 --> 02:24:13.38
it just kind of happened for whatever reason we kind of bonded more and were closer to each other

1634
02:24:13.38 --> 02:24:18.18
then either of Swarade Jessica we didn't exclude her anything like that it just kind of naturally

1635
02:24:18.18 --> 02:24:26.02
we were kind of closer and she always knew that and felt it you know that she

1636
02:24:26.02 --> 02:24:32.58
she that Lindsay and I were closer to each other than we were to her that when we would get

1637
02:24:32.58 --> 02:24:38.42
farmed out to different relatives like you know people were like happy to take me and Lindsay and

1638
02:24:38.42 --> 02:24:43.54
they would have taken Jessica if it was like look she has to go somewhere but you know if she

1639
02:24:43.54 --> 02:24:47.62
didn't want to come you know because she was attached to my mom nobody was going to really like

1640
02:24:47.62 --> 02:24:55.86
push for it or anything and so she grew up her whole life kind of always being kind of on the outside

1641
02:24:55.86 --> 02:25:04.18
and always being kind of thought of just not ever being anybody's first priority you know it's

1642
02:25:04.18 --> 02:25:11.70
just something that a kid needs at least for for some period you know and um and she struggled with

1643
02:25:11.70 --> 02:25:16.98
that and you know I got out I went to the Navy and I'm just happy to be out of the house and

1644
02:25:16.98 --> 02:25:23.70
doing my thing in the Navy and Lindsay's in college and doing well and we kind of know that Jessica's

1645
02:25:23.70 --> 02:25:27.86
still struggling back home a little bit she's back home she with my mom's totally cleaned up

1646
02:25:27.86 --> 02:25:32.42
by this point and she's trying to get my sister you know help her get herself together

1647
02:25:33.70 --> 02:25:38.66
but you know she's struggling she has a hard time she's she gets pregnant with my nephew

1648
02:25:39.30 --> 02:25:43.14
and inexplicably the doc she she has a bunch of back pain while she's pregnant with my

1649
02:25:43.14 --> 02:25:48.18
nephew the doctor puts her on oxy cotton my nephew comes out Jones and it birth

1650
02:25:50.74 --> 02:25:55.14
and she didn't she she was never able to kick that right and it kind of did generated in the

1651
02:25:55.14 --> 02:26:01.22
common way where she's hooked on that and she starts becoming you know difficult to deal with for

1652
02:26:01.22 --> 02:26:05.86
people who love her my mom wants to help her but she doesn't know if like you know at a certain

1653
02:26:05.86 --> 02:26:10.10
point or you enableing you know at a certain point you have to put your foot down you know she's

1654
02:26:10.10 --> 02:26:15.06
stealing out of my purse to do things when she's at my grandparents house you know she's trying

1655
02:26:15.06 --> 02:26:20.42
to raid their medicine cabinet and so she's got friends that are telling her you know and

1656
02:26:20.42 --> 02:26:24.82
other people in her own her own mind you know just telling her like look at a certain point you

1657
02:26:24.82 --> 02:26:30.10
have to give some tough love and and it makes sense you know that is what you have to do right

1658
02:26:30.10 --> 02:26:37.38
at a certain point you are enabling and she did that one time when my sister came to the house

1659
02:26:37.38 --> 02:26:43.46
my my nephew is staying with my mom by this point and my sister came to the house one time in the

1660
02:26:43.46 --> 02:26:50.50
winter it's in Montana it's a cold winter and she wanted to stay there and my mom had like been

1661
02:26:50.50 --> 02:26:56.66
preparing herself before she knew that like when the moment came she wasn't gonna have the strength

1662
02:26:56.66 --> 02:27:01.38
to say no right so she had been kind of coaching herself up like when it comes you just have to

1663
02:27:01.38 --> 02:27:05.14
here's what you have to say here's the script you know unless you're willing to do this this

1664
02:27:05.14 --> 02:27:08.66
and this then no do do do do do just you have to go stay with your friends or whatever it is

1665
02:27:09.70 --> 02:27:15.38
and so she shows up and she wants to stay with my mom and my mom tells her you know

1666
02:27:15.86 --> 02:27:20.50
can't have you do it the last several times you've been lying this and that and she didn't

1667
02:27:20.50 --> 02:27:27.30
have any girls to go that night and so she went to the rescue mission therentown and she took some

1668
02:27:27.30 --> 02:27:35.38
pills and she died there alone and it's just the most abjectly awful story you know I was

1669
02:27:35.38 --> 02:27:41.86
I was in the Navy I kind of knew something was going wrong but you know I didn't you're just

1670
02:27:41.86 --> 02:27:47.38
you're living your own life and to say that like you know when I look back on it because I feel

1671
02:27:47.38 --> 02:27:53.46
tremendous amount of guilt obviously thinking to myself now and the aftermath that you know I should

1672
02:27:53.46 --> 02:27:58.82
just drop everything and just said you're coming to stay with me and focus on this a hundred

1673
02:27:58.82 --> 02:28:03.54
percent right just because what else matters when this is the end but you don't think that that's

1674
02:28:03.54 --> 02:28:09.22
the end you're just kind of you know you hear that she's struggling but she's not struggling at

1675
02:28:09.22 --> 02:28:14.42
bad right when I would call her it would seem okay so I just kind of out of sight out of mind I was

1676
02:28:14.42 --> 02:28:19.94
living my own life and wasn't focusing on it and nobody was focusing on it and that was the point

1677
02:28:19.94 --> 02:28:28.26
nobody was other than my mom and it's just an awful story it's a girl who was never put first

1678
02:28:29.22 --> 02:28:36.74
who came out of like a very difficult set of circumstances and you know one out of three she just

1679
02:28:36.74 --> 02:28:45.54
didn't make it out and yet that horrible story that ended in such a tragic way it saved my family

1680
02:28:45.54 --> 02:28:56.02
you know and it brought my whole extended family that you know when when I say like it wasn't

1681
02:28:56.02 --> 02:29:00.26
just like people had gotten an arguments with each other and this got on the putter beside it was that

1682
02:29:00.26 --> 02:29:06.34
whole the whole thread that had brought my family together my great grandmother coming from Serbia when

1683
02:29:06.34 --> 02:29:11.30
she was seven years old my great grandfather coming out of Mexico just and then it just degenerates

1684
02:29:11.30 --> 02:29:17.38
and breaks down and by the time it gets to like the generation before me it's just this typical

1685
02:29:17.38 --> 02:29:23.46
like American broken down family scenario right that it just fallen apart it was just it had fallen apart

1686
02:29:24.42 --> 02:29:32.58
and that and that when we all came together for her funeral that it was as if

1687
02:29:34.26 --> 02:29:39.70
everything like everything was redeemed but by you know during that period it was like everything

1688
02:29:39.70 --> 02:29:44.74
that had been bad and broken was suddenly repaired and something that it wasn't like a

1689
02:29:44.74 --> 02:29:49.22
not repairs and not the right way to say it because it wasn't like there was this there was this family

1690
02:29:49.22 --> 02:29:54.90
there that had gotten broken up and now it got fixed it didn't exist before so something that was

1691
02:29:54.90 --> 02:30:03.78
born out of that tragedy and I realized that you know if I could it doesn't clear up all the

1692
02:30:03.78 --> 02:30:08.82
negative feelings obviously but if I could see it in that way that her death could become a

1693
02:30:08.82 --> 02:30:15.86
sacrifice you know something that she was the one who who gave her life there was you know

1694
02:30:16.42 --> 02:30:19.78
obviously she wasn't thinking of it this way but she gave her life so that our family

1695
02:30:20.58 --> 02:30:29.30
could could be born out of that and and that the stories we tell ourselves about the things we do

1696
02:30:29.30 --> 02:30:38.18
in the lives we're living you know very often or the things that those are really what to find

1697
02:30:38.18 --> 02:30:44.50
us you know and I think a lot of people aren't living any story and they're very vulnerable to

1698
02:30:44.50 --> 02:30:49.22
people who come along and say I got a story for you you know I got something for you right here

1699
02:30:49.22 --> 02:30:54.74
maybe it's Jim Jones maybe it's a Jehaadi maybe it's you know some racial group whatever it is I got

1700
02:30:54.74 --> 02:31:01.46
a story for you you know that puts you right in the middle and takes you seriously it makes you

1701
02:31:01.46 --> 02:31:06.74
important in a way that you've never been to anybody before makes it very vulnerable to those things

1702
02:31:06.74 --> 02:31:16.42
and I think that something I hope we can do with the thread is is is tell some of these stories

1703
02:31:16.42 --> 02:31:22.42
you know in a way that kind of you know you and I have both been around the world a lot and being

1704
02:31:22.42 --> 02:31:28.82
around the world it teaches you that whatever is going on that's wrong around here there's a

1705
02:31:28.82 --> 02:31:35.22
whole lot of good there's a whole lot of good you know around here in this country and our society

1706
02:31:35.22 --> 02:31:42.10
and the people around us and there's an opportunity and that and that and that when people

1707
02:31:42.10 --> 02:31:47.38
don't feel that way they look around here at their families or their communities or their

1708
02:31:47.38 --> 02:31:52.90
country and they don't feel good about it that's just a story too you know and you can there are

1709
02:31:52.90 --> 02:31:59.30
better stories out there to tell that can frame your own life and you know your community's life

1710
02:31:59.30 --> 02:32:06.66
in your country's life in ways that you know are a lot more fulfilling and I would say a lot

1711
02:32:06.66 --> 02:32:13.30
true or then some of the ones that you know tend to tend to be undermining so that's something I

1712
02:32:13.30 --> 02:32:32.82
hope we can do well if that's the goal then I'm sure we can

1713
02:32:43.46 --> 02:32:50.26
yeah it's very humbling you know because I um my sister was a good girl she was a sweet girl

1714
02:32:51.30 --> 02:33:00.66
and um you know I I feel no sense of pride in the fact that you know I came out of

1715
02:33:01.38 --> 02:33:06.82
rough circumstances and managed to like make it out and now I'm you know securely in the middle class

1716
02:33:06.82 --> 02:33:10.10
or whatever however you want to frame but I feel no sense of pride in that because I know people

1717
02:33:10.10 --> 02:33:14.26
who were better than me and who were stronger than me and who had better hearts than I do

1718
02:33:16.18 --> 02:33:23.38
who didn't make it and that if there were a couple times growing up or in my early adulthood

1719
02:33:24.02 --> 02:33:30.66
when if I had ziggged instead of zagging or even when I where I just I got purely lucky you know

1720
02:33:30.66 --> 02:33:37.62
where I you know early 20s I get into a big fight out in town and the cops decide that it's

1721
02:33:37.62 --> 02:33:44.18
they're just gonna let me roll out you know whereas if you know if I was five maybe a darker

1722
02:33:44.18 --> 02:33:48.98
color skin that instead they'd be pulling my ass in and throwing me in jail and then I'm not going

1723
02:33:48.98 --> 02:33:55.86
into the navy and then I'm not just a whole train of things starts to happen you know where I just

1724
02:33:55.86 --> 02:34:01.30
got I very very very lucky I know people who are way better way smarter way stronger than I am

1725
02:34:01.30 --> 02:34:06.74
who ended up going completely off the rails and it deserve has nothing to do with it you know did they

1726
02:34:06.74 --> 02:34:14.18
deserve it well they made decisions yeah sure I made decisions but a lot of it just came down

1727
02:34:14.18 --> 02:34:22.10
to pure luck you know and it makes me it makes me very it's humbling it's humbling and it makes

1728
02:34:22.10 --> 02:34:30.98
me I try to as much as I know that you know you can get into a toxic mindset self-limiting

1729
02:34:30.98 --> 02:34:38.34
kind of toxic mindset by feeling like a victim so I you know I don't support that kind of thing but

1730
02:34:38.34 --> 02:34:44.58
I it does make me very I try to open up my heart to people who find themselves in difficult

1731
02:34:44.58 --> 02:34:50.90
circumstances because I know that is an act of God it is a you know but by the grace of God that

1732
02:34:50.90 --> 02:34:59.30
that's where I could have been you know and I I attribute none of it to you know my own and again

1733
02:34:59.30 --> 02:35:04.58
yeah you have to make choices but very easily could have gone a different way with the same

1734
02:35:04.58 --> 02:35:09.70
exact choices that I made yeah there's there's always going to be some level of luck involved

1735
02:35:09.70 --> 02:35:16.98
for sure and there's also like a little tiny, minuscule decisions that you make for whatever

1736
02:35:16.98 --> 02:35:23.46
reason that you make them and sometimes those have a trajectory that who last the dress your life

1737
02:35:23.46 --> 02:35:27.70
and it could be good sure like when I decided to join the Navy because let's face it that's a

1738
02:35:27.70 --> 02:35:34.34
it seems like a really really big decision and I guess it is but at the same time you know

1739
02:35:34.34 --> 02:35:40.50
there's a split second in time where you go you know what I'm gonna do this but that there's a split

1740
02:35:40.50 --> 02:35:45.70
second where it's a coin toss and you go you know what I'm gonna do this I had by a friends that

1741
02:35:45.70 --> 02:35:50.58
were right alongside with the only I'm gonna go and then they didn't go in and things did not work

1742
02:35:50.58 --> 02:35:56.34
out well for them at all and so when you look at like all these little decisions and just like

1743
02:35:56.34 --> 02:36:02.02
you said I mean what you know how many people's lives have been ruined by you know the one DUI that they got

1744
02:36:02.02 --> 02:36:06.74
which they crashed and they hid and they this that the other thing how many people's lives have been

1745
02:36:06.74 --> 02:36:14.34
ruined by whatever whatever momentary decision that they made that just just it went wrong and

1746
02:36:14.34 --> 02:36:19.62
you know you saw that combat all the time you know I've said many times there's there's times where I

1747
02:36:19.62 --> 02:36:26.34
made bad decisions and and like got home and said to myself well got away with that I'd never

1748
02:36:26.34 --> 02:36:30.02
should have got away with that I can't believe I got away with that got so lucky and there's other

1749
02:36:30.02 --> 02:36:37.46
times we make the right decisions and things still go wrong and so there's absolutely some level

1750
02:36:37.46 --> 02:36:45.38
of luck in there and what you have to do as a human being is recognize that and then every chance

1751
02:36:45.38 --> 02:36:50.18
you get to lean that thing in the right direction you got to take it and as soon as the soon you

1752
02:36:50.18 --> 02:36:54.50
recognize that in your life the better off you're gonna be because the sooner you recognize all right

1753
02:36:55.06 --> 02:37:02.02
this could be the bad decision that I make this could be it you know I I used to occasionally

1754
02:37:02.74 --> 02:37:10.90
if I had a seal who was working for me that was like I could see where he's heading and you know

1755
02:37:10.90 --> 02:37:15.86
a brief I'd give him this brief right here hey this is what I want you to do I don't want you to

1756
02:37:15.86 --> 02:37:20.18
dump shit I don't I don't want you to do anything that's stupid do you understand what's the

1757
02:37:20.18 --> 02:37:24.02
world the words that are coming out of my mouth and that's kind of what they need to do here look

1758
02:37:24.02 --> 02:37:30.58
I don't want you to do anything that's stupid do you understand what I'm saying and that kind of

1759
02:37:30.58 --> 02:37:35.86
thing because if you put that as a broad overarching when you're 21 years old if you say look at

1760
02:37:35.86 --> 02:37:41.38
I'm gonna I'm just gonna try not to do anything that's stupid that's actually some really

1761
02:37:42.02 --> 02:37:46.58
solid advice to go off of and if I wish I would have had somebody there's a lot of

1762
02:37:46.58 --> 02:37:51.14
decisions that I made that I look back now where I think could have gone bad I want to look back

1763
02:37:51.14 --> 02:37:55.94
out of it if somebody would have just said don't do anything say don't do dumb shit

1764
02:37:56.58 --> 02:38:00.66
somebody would have told me that it would have helped me out a lot it would have helped me out a lot

1765
02:38:00.66 --> 02:38:06.34
to and and again I was just I got lucky along the way and the time that I did something stupid I didn't

1766
02:38:06.34 --> 02:38:11.38
crash the car the time I did something else stupid I didn't you don't fall into this

1767
02:38:11.38 --> 02:38:16.82
crevasse that I thought oh I'd be cool I'll jump over this thing or whatever the case may be

1768
02:38:16.82 --> 02:38:22.66
you make dumb decisions if someone saying to you hey don't do dumb shit it's actually

1769
02:38:22.66 --> 02:38:28.98
really really good advice because at the end of the day there's that that sometimes it's coin toss

1770
02:38:28.98 --> 02:38:38.58
and do yourself a favor and don't flip that coin if you don't have to and then to what you're

1771
02:38:38.58 --> 02:38:45.86
saying when you look at somebody whenever I see somebody like that's that I can see they're

1772
02:38:45.86 --> 02:38:52.26
vended up in a bad situation it's like I know that there were some coin tosses in there that

1773
02:38:52.26 --> 02:38:58.34
that came up bad I know it that's what happens and the difference between you know me and that

1774
02:38:58.34 --> 02:39:04.74
person that's strong out on meth you know sitting in this corner you know covered in their own piss

1775
02:39:05.70 --> 02:39:12.98
there's some coin tosses in there and so minimize those freaking coin tosses and then yeah you

1776
02:39:12.98 --> 02:39:17.14
got it to you look there's some luck involved make your freaking luck to you got to make your

1777
02:39:17.14 --> 02:39:23.06
freaking luck because you can't rely on that coin coming up the way you wanted to so get up

1778
02:39:23.78 --> 02:39:27.94
take control of what you know what you've been saying take control take ownership of what's going on

1779
02:39:27.94 --> 02:39:32.90
everything that you control control it don't let it go don't leave it up the chance you can't

1780
02:39:32.90 --> 02:39:39.22
not afford to do that you cannot afford to do that the coin tosses don't always go your way

1781
02:39:46.18 --> 02:39:55.62
with that probably a pretty good place to stop you know darel thanks for um thanks your service

1785
02:40:17.38 --> 02:40:25.38
lazy but uh echo yes we want to take control over what we can take control of make our own luck

1786

you help us there are many ways right fitness physical mind and body fitness

1792
02:41:06.98 --> 02:41:12.66
good way to get that coin to kind of fall the way you wanted to oh yeah manufacture some

1793
02:41:12.66 --> 02:41:20.26
odds you can manufacture odds yeah yeah so anyway also capability big time capability reading

1794
02:41:20.26 --> 02:41:25.46
as it turns out increases your capability big time yeah so does jujitsu by the way

1795
02:41:26.34 --> 02:41:30.82
but I think we already knew that so while we're doing our jujitsu we're going to get a

1796
02:41:30.82 --> 02:41:37.62
ghee at least one my opinion and we're gonna get that from origin factually the best ghee in the

1797
02:41:37.62 --> 02:41:44.50
world that's why we're getting them from origin you also might want to support the entire

1798
02:41:44.50 --> 02:41:51.14
economy of this country by buying something that's made in America literally no yeah especially

1799
02:41:51.14 --> 02:42:00.34
right now you might want to support the economy you might want to support jobs coming back to this

1800
02:42:00.34 --> 02:42:08.66
country rebuilding an industry that was all but dead but it ain't dead anymore I just bought

1801
02:42:08.66 --> 02:42:14.66
two of those face masks you guys are making a black and a white legit yeah yeah that was a pivot

1802
02:42:14.66 --> 02:42:20.58
never be too beautiful doing your duty as an American a little pivot oh yeah yeah and that it's like

1803
02:42:21.78 --> 02:42:26.26
that was good when like I was watching that video or there I think there's more than one right about

1804
02:42:26.26 --> 02:42:32.26
the face masks of what pizza doing so it's interesting to see like you know under these kind of

1805
02:42:32.26 --> 02:42:37.22
more for lack of better term extreme circumstances what people and groups of people in companies are

1806
02:42:37.22 --> 02:42:42.66
doing you know and you can kind of tell a lot about I mean a lot I mean what does that even mean but

1807
02:42:42.66 --> 02:42:48.34
you can tell some things about some people and groups of people by what they do under certain

1808
02:42:48.34 --> 02:42:52.90
circumstances I think generally speaking that's true right but okay here's a little background so

1809
02:42:52.90 --> 02:42:58.18
we have a company it's called the origin we make clothes there is a virus going around America right

1810
02:42:58.18 --> 02:43:11.38
now called the coronavirus right now it is March 25th 2020 so this virus hit at first I had a

1811
02:43:11.38 --> 02:43:16.50
couple friends text me and say like hey you should make masks to protect people from this and I was like

1812
02:43:16.50 --> 02:43:20.42
oh and I talked to Pete my partner to origin and said hey man what do you think about making

1813
02:43:20.42 --> 02:43:24.82
masks and he kind of looked at it said well I guess we could what's the real you know what's the

1814
02:43:24.82 --> 02:43:29.38
real demand going to be blah blah blah blah and then a couple days later a few days later

1815
02:43:30.10 --> 02:43:36.10
the government starts saying look masks don't help they don't help and I'm like okay well I

1816
02:43:36.10 --> 02:43:41.38
say I don't worry about the masks don't help I don't want to be the guy that's trying to sell

1817
02:43:41.38 --> 02:43:46.66
something that doesn't work right so you know so we kind of abandon the idea and that's all

1818
02:43:46.66 --> 02:43:50.66
takes place in like a very short period of time all this because you guys tracking this new story

1819
02:43:50.66 --> 02:43:56.82
it's been changing on an hourly basis so then you fast forward two or three days and they're

1820
02:43:56.82 --> 02:44:04.50
saying not only should you wear a mask but you need to wear a mask and also we've got people in

1821
02:44:04.50 --> 02:44:09.62
healthcare and whatever that absolutely need these masks and there's no masks in America like

1822
02:44:09.62 --> 02:44:14.98
or there's a massive shortage so now I go back to Pete and say Pete bro it looks like these masks

1823
02:44:14.98 --> 02:44:22.66
are needed and he kind of percolated on it and my mind was stuck in like okay we got to make

1824
02:44:22.66 --> 02:44:30.10
a surgical mask like what you see on a surgeon way right Pete he said wait a second and he said oh let's

1825
02:44:30.10 --> 02:44:37.14
make he took our rash guard material because it's the other thing the CDC was saying if you don't

1826
02:44:37.14 --> 02:44:45.06
have a surgical mask just take a t-shirt or take a piece of bandana that's what they were saying and

1827
02:44:45.06 --> 02:44:49.94
so he said okay wait I think we can really help here but then Pete came up with the idea of making

1828
02:44:49.94 --> 02:44:55.06
a mask from a rash guard material kind of like I guess the word is a buff have you ever heard this

1829
02:44:55.06 --> 02:45:01.14
before okay so it's basically like a neck a gator let's another thing it gets called I don't know

1830
02:45:01.14 --> 02:45:08.34
what to call it but most people call it a buff anyways we put a little pocket in there so you could put

1831
02:45:08.34 --> 02:45:14.42
a filter if you can get one if not you can still just use the mask and it does help and the CDC

1832
02:45:14.42 --> 02:45:20.82
actually has numbers out like how much it helps if you just put a t-shirt it helps you know 20% if you

1833
02:45:20.82 --> 02:45:26.26
put a bandana and a t-shirt it helps 40% like they calculate this stuff so anyways that's what's

1834
02:45:26.26 --> 02:45:32.98
happening we we started making these masks people been buying them like crazy because you know we're

1835
02:45:32.98 --> 02:45:40.50
getting orders from hospitals we're getting orders from nurses we're getting orders from doctors like

1836
02:45:40.50 --> 02:45:46.10
that's and then we're getting orders from normal citizens as well but so that's what's happening

1837
02:45:46.10 --> 02:45:55.30
and the reason I'm not really I haven't really been promoting it is because it's it were

1838
02:45:55.30 --> 02:46:00.74
so we're sold out like we're making them as fast as we possibly can and and I mean pizza make I

1839
02:46:00.74 --> 02:46:05.70
think he's made four thousand of them today they're all already sold so we're gonna make him as

1840
02:46:05.70 --> 02:46:09.54
fast as we can we're gonna make his menus we can but we're trying to get him to the right people

1841
02:46:10.10 --> 02:46:14.98
and that's what's happening with that yeah and those masks are kind of important to when you

1842
02:46:14.98 --> 02:46:19.14
think of the big picture because I mean the initial thought where it's like where masks people

1843
02:46:19.14 --> 02:46:24.98
we like well you know I'll just sort of you know like I won't I'll be careful with where I breathe

1844
02:46:24.98 --> 02:46:30.34
or whatever my immune system whatever but the mask is kind of a two-way street where that protects

1845
02:46:30.34 --> 02:46:34.26
you but it protects it for sure is it's well that's something they said from time get go I know

1846
02:46:34.26 --> 02:46:37.86
from that go they said actually we don't think that though yeah here's where here's where I

1847
02:46:37.86 --> 02:46:41.30
is kind of like man I should have thought through this more from the get go they said you know

1848
02:46:41.94 --> 02:46:46.82
masks don't help but it will help to prevent spreading it if you have it you should wear it

1849
02:46:46.82 --> 02:46:51.86
and I'm like wait a second you're telling me that this will help someone not give it to me but if

1850
02:46:51.86 --> 02:46:56.90
I put it on it won't help me at all are you crazy hold on a second that doesn't make any sense

1851
02:46:56.90 --> 02:47:01.94
so I should have known that from the beginning but I didn't I didn't sus it out correctly

1852
02:47:02.74 --> 02:47:06.66
yeah and but in that kind of goes goes with it where it's like yeah it doesn't help me at

1853
02:47:06.66 --> 02:47:10.74
also it's more like that's like a secondary thought you know but I think collect like I said

1854
02:47:10.74 --> 02:47:15.30
big picture situation where collectively hey man we're all the more than we get everyone together yeah

1855
02:47:15.30 --> 02:47:20.58
everybody yeah and then so that's not that's not to mention okay what are all these secondary effects

1856
02:47:20.58 --> 02:47:24.42
like economy people going back to work all this stuff and were you part of that problem

1857
02:47:24.42 --> 02:47:28.90
were are you part of the problems spreading this whole thing or you're trying to sell exactly

1858
02:47:28.90 --> 02:47:32.66
right if you're part of helping not okay here comes the economy way quicker here comes people

1859
02:47:32.66 --> 02:47:37.78
going back to work you know all the secondary stuff but all you weren't all you were just like

1860
02:47:37.78 --> 02:47:43.54
you strong young guy who has a strong immune system we didn't care about any of this other stuff

1861
02:47:43.54 --> 02:47:47.86
you see I'm saying so it's like man you got to wear that mask or yeah and not even necessarily

1862
02:47:47.86 --> 02:47:51.62
wear the mask specific they're not seeing that I'm saying be part of the solution in this because

1863
02:47:51.62 --> 02:47:57.06
kind of the infarmed solution is it being that's part of being an American yeah and by the way

1864
02:47:57.06 --> 02:48:04.98
another thing like I just got this as a comment in here um peep put together a face mask like a

1865
02:48:04.98 --> 02:48:11.38
face shield with what's a clear plastic like printer paper what is it lamination paper something

1866
02:48:11.38 --> 02:48:18.10
like that he he put together a mask with that yeah a mask well you could go welding like

1867
02:48:18.10 --> 02:48:23.46
you kind of see you go that's kind of cool whatever guess what he's got he just got an organ like

1868
02:48:23.46 --> 02:48:29.30
off based off of him stapling this thing together uh the state of Maine just I think it was the state

1869
02:48:29.30 --> 02:48:35.06
of some some big governmental organization just ordered a thousand of them a thousand of these things

1870
02:48:35.06 --> 02:48:42.02
like that's where they're at they need protection and so it's been very it's been it's been

1871

1893
02:50:55.54 --> 02:51:03.86
people right the stitches the folks that actually have the capability to build things in America

1894
02:51:03.86 --> 02:51:10.90
if we don't keep them who's gonna do this for us that's the backbone of America right there that's

1895
02:51:10.90 --> 02:51:16.18
the backbone of America is the folks on the front lines that have the skills to get this done

1896
02:51:16.18 --> 02:51:24.34

1902
02:51:59.94 --> 02:52:08.02
I always amazed and sometimes you you get an idea and you go fan that happened with the way of the

1903
02:52:08.02 --> 02:52:14.18
warrior kid like I had that idea and I said how can no one have thought of this oh my gosh I'm so lucky

1904
02:52:14.90 --> 02:52:21.38
and I just wrote it and put out their cold war cold war probably a year and a half ago

1905
02:52:21.38 --> 02:52:28.26
I was like hey man talk to be little I said hey man I am on the planes all the time I'm shaking

1908
02:52:41.14 --> 02:52:50.02
about what's so yeah so Brian put together that formula for cold war and yes and of course

1909
02:52:51.38 --> 02:52:55.86
you know we put it out say hey if you guys need some help with someone's like what are you doing

1910
02:52:55.86 --> 02:53:01.70
this won't stop coronavirus I'm like bro no no you are not slinging the cure to

1911
02:53:01.70 --> 02:53:09.70
I'm not slinging the cure to coronavirus now now that being said Dakota Meyer he's slinging the cure

1912
02:53:09.70 --> 02:53:15.30
the cure I did you see what he posted he posted a little bit of jocco discipline go

1913
02:53:15.30 --> 02:53:22.82
dack savage flavor and he's like hey it's me Dakota Meyer I haven't got coronavirus yet

1914
02:53:22.82 --> 02:53:29.22
why because I drink discipline go and destroy next question see else thinking that to

1915
02:53:29.22 --> 02:53:36.90
let's face it as a joke so you know the uh uh killer soap right activated charcoal whatever

1916
02:53:36.90 --> 02:53:43.46
so I'm using killer soap I'm taking cold war joint warfare super-cryo oil discipline every single day

1917
02:53:43.46 --> 02:53:48.26
with you know occasional mulch scenarios I don't think I've had the coronavirus if I have

1918
02:53:48.26 --> 02:53:56.26
an asymptomatic yeah coincidence or jocco if you want I'm just saying I'm just saying but you know

1919
02:53:56.26 --> 02:54:01.94
obviously I'm not gonna make that claim you know go as far as the Dakota Meyer is going on that

1920
02:54:01.94 --> 02:54:06.90
situation but nonetheless those are the facts the case unless like I said the facts of the case yes

1921
02:54:06.90 --> 02:54:11.70
I mentioned milk that is what we had this dessert in the form of a protein many flavors you know

1922
02:54:11.70 --> 02:54:16.26
to at this point it's like just choose your flavor it yeah you know much I mean with you very few

1923
02:54:16.26 --> 02:54:20.74

1970
02:59:08.74 --> 02:59:15.22
the strongest goats it's black the cleanest goats and yeah if you ever seen black soap before

1971
02:59:16.10 --> 02:59:21.46
no yeah so it's it's kind of a psychological thing you get the bar is black

1972
02:59:22.10 --> 02:59:26.34
is black because it's got activated charcoal which echo could tell you all about what that does

1973
02:59:26.34 --> 02:59:32.66
I'll tell you later so it's got activated so it's black but then you what you you wash with it and

1978
02:59:55.70 --> 03:00:01.14
it's got the feeling it's got a feeling here's what's cool a normal bar is soap right

1999
03:01:55.46 --> 03:01:59.62
I remember that yes so now that you're kind of mentioning that I kind of remembered what my

2000
03:01:59.62 --> 03:02:04.98
uh expectation it wasn't very like concrete but it was just kind of of you know what he called

2001
03:02:04.98 --> 03:02:10.42
a one ambiguous expectation and I'm thinking more along the lines of like a Chris Angel scenario

2002
03:02:10.42 --> 03:02:15.06
seeing him who's saying you know Chris Angel is right yeah yeah he does magical tricks yes but

2003
03:02:15.06 --> 03:02:20.74
the last you know I can do pretty if I need to yeah I believe it and the last you

2004
03:02:20.74 --> 03:02:25.06
would see what it looks like youtube channel boom a lot of other stuff on there it serves

2005
03:02:25.06 --> 03:02:30.42

the line around the world right now holding the line thank you for what you're doing out there

2066
03:08:46.26 --> 03:08:55.86
the world is an uncertain place and sometimes the trajectory of your life

2067
03:08:57.22 --> 03:09:05.22
comes down to a little bit of chance and what I'm saying is don't take that chance very often

2068
03:09:05.22 --> 03:09:12.66
and stack the deck in your favor and the way that you do that is by going out there

2069
03:09:12.66 --> 03:09:22.98
taking control and getting after it and until next time this is Darrell Cooper and echo and

2070
03:09:22.98 --> 03:09:39.70
jaional control out
