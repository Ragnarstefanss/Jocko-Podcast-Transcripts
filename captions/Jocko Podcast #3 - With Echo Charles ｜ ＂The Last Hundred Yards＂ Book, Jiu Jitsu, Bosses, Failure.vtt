00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.56
This is Jocco podcast number three with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:10.56 --> 00:00:21.40
So, last show we dug into the book about Facebook, Colonel David Hackworth, and today

3
00:00:21.40 --> 00:00:24.36
we're going to dive into another book.

4
00:00:24.36 --> 00:00:32.72
That was very influential to me, and it's called the last hundred yards.

5
00:00:32.72 --> 00:00:36.68
Now this book is very different from about face in many ways.

6
00:00:36.68 --> 00:00:40.28
Number one, it was not a New York Times bestseller.

7
00:00:40.28 --> 00:00:43.56
It was probably never on any kind of list of any kind.

8
00:00:43.56 --> 00:00:50.72
It's a legit tactical guide book for people in the military.

9
00:00:50.72 --> 00:00:53.000
That's what it is.

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.88
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about the author right now, guy name H.J.

11
00:00:58.88 --> 00:01:05.16
Poo, who retired from the Marine Corps in 1993.

12
00:01:05.16 --> 00:01:09.76
When he was on active duty, he studied small unit tactics for nine years.

13
00:01:09.76 --> 00:01:12.76
Six months at the Basics School in Quantum Aquanico.

14
00:01:12.76 --> 00:01:15.52
Seven months as a Platinum Commander in Vietnam.

15
00:01:15.52 --> 00:01:18.76
Three months as a rifle company commander at Camp Pendleton.

16
00:01:18.76 --> 00:01:26.84
In 1967, five months as a regimental headquarters company commander in Vietnam in 1968.

17
00:01:26.84 --> 00:01:32.56
Eight months as a rifle company commander in Vietnam, 1968 to 1969.

18
00:01:32.56 --> 00:01:38.08
Five and a half years as an instructor with advanced infantry training.

19
00:01:38.08 --> 00:01:40.76
Down at Camp Lijoon.

20
00:01:40.76 --> 00:01:45.36
While he was at that advanced infantry training company, he developed hot refined courses

21
00:01:45.36 --> 00:01:50.28
of instruction on maneuver warfare, land navigation, fire support coordination, call for fire,

22
00:01:50.28 --> 00:01:55.04
adjust fire, close air support, 203 grenade launch, your movement to contact daylight

23
00:01:55.04 --> 00:02:04.36
attack, night attack, infiltration, defense, offensive, military operations in urban terrain,

24
00:02:04.36 --> 00:02:12.64
defensive military operations in urban terrain, NBC defense and leadership.

25
00:02:12.64 --> 00:02:16.32
So the guy has some good background.

26
00:02:16.32 --> 00:02:21.16
And this book was very influential to me when I was coming up.

27
00:02:21.16 --> 00:02:26.44
And again, as I just like with about face, as I was thinking about what I was going to say

28
00:02:26.44 --> 00:02:27.44
about it.

29
00:02:27.44 --> 00:02:31.92
And I wanted to talk about when I got it.

30
00:02:31.92 --> 00:02:33.56
And I couldn't remember when I got about face.

31
00:02:33.56 --> 00:02:35.84
It just kind of came into my life at some point.

32
00:02:35.84 --> 00:02:38.52
And it's the same thing with the last hundred yards.

33
00:02:38.52 --> 00:02:42.92
And I don't really know a hundred percent when I got it or who told me to get it.

34
00:02:42.92 --> 00:02:49.48
It's one of those things that just became so ingrained with me that now I didn't want

35
00:02:49.48 --> 00:02:51.84
to remember when it happened.

36
00:02:51.84 --> 00:03:02.16
So one of the key kind of components or the basis of the book that I kind of have to introduce

37
00:03:02.16 --> 00:03:08.28
YouTube is it talks about something called maneuver warfare.

38
00:03:08.28 --> 00:03:12.52
And maneuver warfare is a, is a obviously a type of warfare.

39
00:03:12.52 --> 00:03:14.48
It's a type of technique.

40
00:03:14.48 --> 00:03:20.12
And it's, it's counter to something that's called attrition warfare.

41
00:03:20.12 --> 00:03:23.52
Now you could probably guess what attrition warfare is.

42
00:03:23.52 --> 00:03:26.32
Attrition warfare is we're going to go against the enemy.

43
00:03:26.32 --> 00:03:29.72
We're going to stand toe to toe and we're going to punch each other in the face until

44
00:03:29.72 --> 00:03:31.12
one of us goes down.

45
00:03:31.12 --> 00:03:33.84
Now you add bombs and bullets into that scenario.

46
00:03:33.84 --> 00:03:37.08
It means we're going to stand across from each other from the enemy.

47
00:03:37.08 --> 00:03:41.64
And we're going to shoot each other and bomb each other until one of us breaks.

48
00:03:41.64 --> 00:03:48.24
And that's very American way of fighting is to start this attrition warfare because

49
00:03:48.24 --> 00:03:50.60
why we've got massive supplies.

50
00:03:50.60 --> 00:03:56.08
We've got awesome industry and we can get away with that.

51
00:03:56.08 --> 00:04:07.60
The maneuver warfare is is very different and to go into the book a little bit in talking

52
00:04:07.60 --> 00:04:10.56
about maneuver warfare.

53
00:04:10.56 --> 00:04:12.000
This is what maneuver warfare is.

54
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.16
In maneuver warfare, the emphasis is on maneuver.

55
00:04:16.16 --> 00:04:20.88
Firepower is considered important only to the extent that it facilitates maneuver.

56
00:04:20.88 --> 00:04:29.96
The overall offensive mission is to win decisively by getting the enemy to surrender.

57
00:04:29.96 --> 00:04:31.96
So it's very different.

58
00:04:31.96 --> 00:04:36.12
In that definition, they're not even looking to kill the person.

59
00:04:36.12 --> 00:04:42.24
They're looking to make them surrender because it's in some ways easier if the enemy

60
00:04:42.24 --> 00:04:43.24
surrenders.

61
00:04:43.24 --> 00:04:44.24
You don't have to kill them all.

62
00:04:44.24 --> 00:04:49.80
Now to go on, the focus is outward on the enemy.

63
00:04:49.80 --> 00:04:51.68
And this is maneuver warfare.

64
00:04:51.68 --> 00:04:55.80
The focus is outward on the enemy.

65
00:04:55.80 --> 00:05:00.48
And a few mistakes like out distancing ones, logistical support or shooting in a friendly

66
00:05:00.48 --> 00:05:04.20
unit are acceptable and unavoidable.

67
00:05:04.20 --> 00:05:06.36
So that's kind of crazy, right?

68
00:05:06.36 --> 00:05:13.20
That you actually take these risks in maneuver warfare where you might engage friendly forces,

69
00:05:13.20 --> 00:05:18.68
you might get so separated that you end up in a bad situation, but it's because you're pushing

70
00:05:18.68 --> 00:05:21.52
the pace.

71
00:05:21.52 --> 00:05:24.44
Control is decentralized.

72
00:05:24.44 --> 00:05:31.04
And every sub-unit or individual is encouraged to display the initiative needed to react

73
00:05:31.04 --> 00:05:33.32
successfully to the local threat.

74
00:05:33.32 --> 00:05:41.48
And this is the biggest distinguisher between a treason warfare and the way it's run and

75
00:05:41.48 --> 00:05:42.88
maneuver warfare.

76
00:05:42.88 --> 00:05:49.60
And that is a chapter in the book Extreme Ownership that lay for an I wrote, it's one of

77
00:05:49.60 --> 00:05:55.52
the laws of combat that we talk about is decentralized command.

78
00:05:55.52 --> 00:06:00.76
Is that everybody that's out on the battlefield, every individual unit leader can make decisions

79
00:06:00.76 --> 00:06:04.72
on their own and they can make something happen, they can react and they can execute without

80
00:06:04.72 --> 00:06:06.68
having to run it up the chain of command.

81
00:06:06.68 --> 00:06:08.12
That's maneuver warfare.

82
00:06:08.12 --> 00:06:10.000
Very, very different.

83
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.56
And you know, these days where we see the big difference, you know, you see a big bureaucratic

84
00:06:14.56 --> 00:06:19.28
company, you know, now that we're working with businesses, we see a big bureaucratic company,

85
00:06:19.28 --> 00:06:23.64
they become very centralized in their control and they fight a Trish and Warfare against

86
00:06:23.64 --> 00:06:26.96
other companies because they're bigger and they have more resources.

87
00:06:26.96 --> 00:06:29.52
Whereas you see the young startups, what are they doing?

88
00:06:29.52 --> 00:06:31.32
They're doing maneuver warfare.

89
00:06:31.32 --> 00:06:36.08
They've got decentralized command, they've got people taking chances, they're taking risks,

90
00:06:36.08 --> 00:06:41.56
they've got different leaders out there on the battlefield that are trying to make things happen.

91
00:06:41.56 --> 00:06:45.24
The emphasis is on training personnel and this is back to the book.

92
00:06:45.24 --> 00:06:49.000
The emphasis is on training personnel well enough ahead of time that they can follow their

93
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.68
commanders intent in combat after only receiving broad guidance.

94
00:06:55.68 --> 00:07:00.68
Of course, sub-unit must still keep their commanders informed of any actions that might

95
00:07:00.68 --> 00:07:02.000
affect a nation units.

96
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.16
So you end up with a situation where the commander is not telling you exactly what to do.

97
00:07:12.16 --> 00:07:13.68
They're giving you broad guidance.

98
00:07:13.68 --> 00:07:17.60
Hey, this is the end state of the mission that I want to have accomplished and you're

99
00:07:17.60 --> 00:07:19.68
not telling you exactly how to accomplish it.

100
00:07:19.68 --> 00:07:22.32
They're just telling you what they want done.

101
00:07:22.32 --> 00:07:27.84
So that's a difference between the two.

102
00:07:27.84 --> 00:07:39.32
Now there's a piece that's very different as well or maybe not different, but another

103
00:07:39.32 --> 00:07:47.16
key element of maneuver warfare and decentralized command versus a Trishon warfare and

104
00:07:47.16 --> 00:07:49.52
centralized command.

105
00:07:49.52 --> 00:07:54.76
So if you're listening and you haven't been the military before, the military is separated

106
00:07:54.76 --> 00:07:59.20
into two groups of people, officers and it listed people.

107
00:07:59.20 --> 00:08:07.000
The officers are sort of the senior leaders who are strategic planners and they're

108
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.20
they're they broader higher ranking leaders.

109
00:08:10.20 --> 00:08:15.32
And then the enlisted are the tacticians, the folks that are shooting the machine guns,

110
00:08:15.32 --> 00:08:17.68
throwing their grenades, making things happen.

111
00:08:17.68 --> 00:08:24.96
And they do have the enlisted servicemen also have their non commissioned officers which are

112
00:08:24.96 --> 00:08:30.16
the senior ranking enlisted guys which are usually the expert tacticians.

113
00:08:30.16 --> 00:08:34.000
But it's interesting.

114
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.92
So this is going back to the book now.

115
00:08:35.92 --> 00:08:41.56
In the average platoon, the NCOs provide most of the collective experience.

116
00:08:41.56 --> 00:08:46.44
So again, you see this sometimes in the movies where they get the young officer and their

117
00:08:46.44 --> 00:08:51.80
green and they don't really know what's going on and then you get the salty old badass that's

118
00:08:51.80 --> 00:09:00.84
played by a salty old, you know, a clen Eastwood and that older guy with all the experience.

119
00:09:00.84 --> 00:09:02.52
That's what that's saying.

120
00:09:02.52 --> 00:09:06.12
The NCOs provide most of the collective experience.

121
00:09:06.12 --> 00:09:09.96
For this reason, they should participate in most of the tactical decisions.

122
00:09:09.96 --> 00:09:12.000
That absolutely makes sense.

123
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.56
They should in no way challenge the authority of the officers.

124
00:09:16.56 --> 00:09:17.72
That's sensible.

125
00:09:17.72 --> 00:09:23.84
After all, commissioned and non commissioned officers share the same responsibilities in combat.

126
00:09:23.84 --> 00:09:28.76
If the lieutenant, which is the officer, is wounded, the platoon sergeant takes over.

127
00:09:28.76 --> 00:09:30.44
When they both, this is key.

128
00:09:30.44 --> 00:09:34.04
When they both work together, better decisions result.

129
00:09:34.04 --> 00:09:36.84
Obviously, you've got two minds instead of one.

130
00:09:36.84 --> 00:09:41.96
This brain trust can be further enhanced by including

131
00:09:41.96 --> 00:09:42.96
squad leaders.

132
00:09:42.96 --> 00:09:45.12
So they're saying, let's bring in more minds.

133
00:09:45.12 --> 00:09:46.76
More of these junior and listed guys.

134
00:09:46.76 --> 00:09:50.32
Let's find out what they think.

135
00:09:50.32 --> 00:09:55.68
The enduring satisfaction that comes from making a situationally correct decision and then

136
00:09:55.68 --> 00:10:03.32
having that decision fully supported during execution, far outweighs the temporary insecurity

137
00:10:03.32 --> 00:10:07.04
that may come from soliciting the advice of support.

138
00:10:07.04 --> 00:10:09.04
I love that.

139
00:10:09.04 --> 00:10:10.04
I love that.

140
00:10:10.04 --> 00:10:11.04
Be careful.

141
00:10:11.04 --> 00:10:11.88
I'm going to say it again.

142
00:10:11.88 --> 00:10:15.000
So it's saying that the decision and the execution doing that well,

143
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.64
far outweighs the temporary insecurity that may come from soliciting the advice of

144
00:10:20.64 --> 00:10:21.96
supportants.

145
00:10:21.96 --> 00:10:26.32
So, and I used to see this with these young junior officers.

146
00:10:26.32 --> 00:10:30.96
If they're insecure with their leadership, they don't want to take advice and they definitely

147
00:10:30.96 --> 00:10:33.92
don't want to ask for advice because they feel like that makes them look weak.

148
00:10:33.92 --> 00:10:35.92
They don't know what they're talking about.

149
00:10:35.92 --> 00:10:37.12
Yeah, they don't know what they're talking about.

150
00:10:37.12 --> 00:10:39.88
Oh, they're going to lose respect.

151
00:10:39.88 --> 00:10:41.80
That's all they're ego talking.

152
00:10:41.80 --> 00:10:43.88
And is their insecurity talking.

153
00:10:43.88 --> 00:10:49.000
Whereas you get a young officer that's smart and that's confident, he has no problem looking

154
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.88
at the gunnery sergeant or looking at the platoon chief and saying, hey chief, how do you

155
00:10:52.88 --> 00:10:54.20
think we should do this?

156
00:10:54.20 --> 00:10:57.32
Hey chief, I've never even seen this type of operation before.

157
00:10:57.32 --> 00:11:01.72
Can you give me some help or can you take lead on this?

158
00:11:01.72 --> 00:11:05.96
And that is the way a real leader operates.

159
00:11:05.96 --> 00:11:07.36
You don't always see that.

160
00:11:07.36 --> 00:11:08.36
Unfortunately.

161
00:11:08.36 --> 00:11:12.04
Same thing with the mistakes too, right, when you say, oh man, I made that mistake.

162
00:11:12.04 --> 00:11:13.04
Oh, exactly.

163
00:11:13.04 --> 00:11:15.88
It's hard to do that a lot of the time because you think, oh, this guy doesn't know what

164
00:11:15.88 --> 00:11:16.88
he's doing.

165
00:11:16.88 --> 00:11:19.08
Yeah, obviously, he made a mistake, even admitted it, kind of thing.

166
00:11:19.08 --> 00:11:20.08
Yeah.

167
00:11:20.08 --> 00:11:22.64
And with the reality is, people don't actually think that.

168
00:11:22.64 --> 00:11:24.44
They don't think, oh, he just admitted his mistake.

169
00:11:24.44 --> 00:11:25.44
He really doesn't know what he's doing.

170
00:11:25.44 --> 00:11:26.44
No, they're okay.

171
00:11:26.44 --> 00:11:27.68
Well, at least he's aware of his mistake.

172
00:11:27.68 --> 00:11:30.04
Unless everything they do is a mistake.

173
00:11:30.04 --> 00:11:31.72
And that's different.

174
00:11:31.72 --> 00:11:37.92
On the other hand, it is according disaster to rely on one's personal impressions to provide

175
00:11:37.92 --> 00:11:42.32
this solution to complex scenario and then not consider whether one's subordinates have

176
00:11:42.32 --> 00:11:44.56
the skills to execute that solution.

177
00:11:44.56 --> 00:11:50.52
So don't sit there, stuck in your own brain, afraid to ask anybody else, or you're

178
00:11:50.52 --> 00:11:55.92
going to lose.

179
00:11:55.92 --> 00:12:07.56
Now, as we push through this, we can get pretty deep to you at this going back to the

180
00:12:07.56 --> 00:12:08.56
book again.

181
00:12:08.56 --> 00:12:13.96
To a US infantryman actively engaged in a losing effort, this shortage of resreference

182
00:12:13.96 --> 00:12:16.32
material can be quite unsettling.

183
00:12:16.32 --> 00:12:21.20
And what this is talking about previously to this sentence is saying that although there's

184
00:12:21.20 --> 00:12:27.92
all kinds of books and manuals in the military, this detailed reference material of exactly

185
00:12:27.92 --> 00:12:29.96
how to do the frontline.

186
00:12:29.96 --> 00:12:31.80
What is that point man do?

187
00:12:31.80 --> 00:12:33.56
What does that machine gun or do?

188
00:12:33.56 --> 00:12:35.20
How do they actually do it?

189
00:12:35.20 --> 00:12:42.32
That information can get lost because it's more past word amount than anything else.

190
00:12:42.32 --> 00:12:46.72
And it goes into a talking about the leave it or not, hack worth.

191
00:12:46.72 --> 00:12:51.32
With a combat commission from Korea, Lieutenant Colonel David Hackworth was no stranger to

192
00:12:51.32 --> 00:12:54.88
war when he called the serve in Vietnam.

193
00:12:54.88 --> 00:12:59.92
After two tours, he pointed out that the US knowledge on small unit infantry tactics had

194
00:12:59.92 --> 00:13:05.20
not been significantly enhanced by the longest war in US history meaning Vietnam.

195
00:13:05.20 --> 00:13:07.96
And here's what Hackworth said.

196
00:13:07.96 --> 00:13:12.56
Almost 15 years since the tragic inevitable fall of Saigon.

197
00:13:12.56 --> 00:13:16.32
And this is so he's saying this 15 years after the end of Vietnam war.

198
00:13:16.32 --> 00:13:20.92
Almost 15 years since the end since the tragic inevitable fall of Saigon, there's been no

199
00:13:20.92 --> 00:13:25.04
major honest post-mortem of the war.

200
00:13:25.04 --> 00:13:29.24
There have been critiques dealing with the big picture, but none has addressed the lessons

201
00:13:29.24 --> 00:13:38.76
learned the hard way at the fighting level where people died and the war was in fact lost.

202
00:13:38.76 --> 00:13:45.56
So all those lessons learned and all those no one ever made an honest critique and dug

203
00:13:45.56 --> 00:13:48.40
down on the battlefield to see what these guys could do.

204
00:13:48.40 --> 00:13:52.20
And I know I talked about this last time as well is that when I first got in the seal

205
00:13:52.20 --> 00:13:55.80
teams, there was guys from Vietnam.

206
00:13:55.80 --> 00:14:07.28
And when those guys spoke, you absolutely listened because you were hearing knowledge and

207
00:14:07.28 --> 00:14:13.24
that if I didn't experience that, if I didn't meet those guys, I wouldn't hurt it.

208
00:14:13.24 --> 00:14:15.12
It wasn't written down anywhere.

209
00:14:15.12 --> 00:14:21.56
And so you've got to always remember when you do learn stuff, you got to write it down.

210
00:14:21.56 --> 00:14:26.000
You know, Lafin, I talked about that, the fact that when we got back from Ramadi, you

211
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.96
know, I started teaching it trade it, which is called training detachment.

212
00:14:30.96 --> 00:14:35.60
And he started teaching the seals that were coming out of the new guys that were coming

213
00:14:35.60 --> 00:14:37.52
out of the seal training.

214
00:14:37.52 --> 00:14:41.56
And that's where we were having the opportunity to really capture a lot of this information

215
00:14:41.56 --> 00:14:46.28
that we learned in Ramadi and we were able to pass it on.

216
00:14:46.28 --> 00:14:53.40
And ultimately those lessons learned are what became the book.

217
00:14:53.40 --> 00:14:59.88
So that being said, you start talking about doctrine.

218
00:14:59.88 --> 00:15:03.88
And I can tell you that doctrine is not everything.

219
00:15:03.88 --> 00:15:07.52
In fact, and you'll hear me talk about people, people's biggest strengths are often their

220
00:15:07.52 --> 00:15:08.52
biggest weaknesses.

221
00:15:08.52 --> 00:15:11.76
So if you have someone that's super aggressive in their aggressive in the business world

222
00:15:11.76 --> 00:15:14.96
and make things happen and that's a real advantage form, but they can get over aggressive

223
00:15:14.96 --> 00:15:17.72
and then they end up doing stupid things and they fail.

224
00:15:17.72 --> 00:15:21.92
That's one example of how your biggest strength can be your biggest weaknesses.

225
00:15:21.92 --> 00:15:29.32
In the seal teams, we really didn't have, we had very limited doctrine.

226
00:15:29.32 --> 00:15:34.48
And it was a real big weakness for us because if you had never run a certain type of operation

227
00:15:34.48 --> 00:15:39.16
before, you couldn't refer back to something and say, okay, here's the method or the

228
00:15:39.16 --> 00:15:43.04
written documentation of how you're supposed to do it.

229
00:15:43.04 --> 00:15:44.44
So that's that's pretty weak.

230
00:15:44.44 --> 00:15:45.44
That's pretty horrible.

231
00:15:45.44 --> 00:15:46.60
It's a big weakness.

232
00:15:46.60 --> 00:15:52.000
But at the same time, it was a strength because as the battlefield changed, it's

233
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.48
we started getting tasked with missions that we had never done before, that no one had

234
00:15:56.48 --> 00:15:58.40
ever done before.

235
00:15:58.40 --> 00:16:01.76
We were very adaptable because we were used to trying to figure things out.

236
00:16:01.76 --> 00:16:06.72
So it's a strength and weakness that being said, and although we did capture much of our

237
00:16:06.72 --> 00:16:12.32
lessons learned, this is going back to the book here, basic field manual, talking about

238
00:16:12.32 --> 00:16:16.20
all these manuals that capture the doctrine.

239
00:16:16.20 --> 00:16:20.04
Knowledge is fine, but it is useless without common sense.

240
00:16:20.04 --> 00:16:26.24
Common sense is of greater value than all the words in the book.

241
00:16:26.24 --> 00:16:31.76
And this is another thing they will stereotypically put in Hollywood movies about cops or

242
00:16:31.76 --> 00:16:32.76
about soldiers.

243
00:16:32.76 --> 00:16:37.76
You know, you've got some guy that's by the book, by the book, by the book.

244
00:16:37.76 --> 00:16:38.76
And you can see it.

245
00:16:38.76 --> 00:16:39.76
This is calling it out.

246
00:16:39.76 --> 00:16:49.08
It's a Colonel Armour R. Sims, a guy that was in the Marine Corps on Guadalcanal.

247
00:16:49.08 --> 00:16:54.72
And he said that common sense was more important than anything in the field manuals,

248
00:16:54.72 --> 00:17:01.96
which is something I completely agree with.

249
00:17:01.96 --> 00:17:06.76
And to carry that point a little bit further back to the book, and here's a quote from

250
00:17:06.76 --> 00:17:15.36
Major General Fuller, the central ideas of an army is known as its doctrine, which to be

251
00:17:15.36 --> 00:17:22.20
sound must be based on principles of war, and which to be effective must be elastic enough

252
00:17:22.20 --> 00:17:29.56
to admit of mutation in accordance with change in circumstance.

253
00:17:29.56 --> 00:17:35.08
So again, these all these people that really understand war, they know that this doctrine

254
00:17:35.08 --> 00:17:40.12
is something that needs to be written, it needs to exist, but it needs to be adapted to.

255
00:17:40.12 --> 00:17:47.56
And common sense is the superior rank over doctrine.

256
00:17:47.56 --> 00:17:57.68
And another thing, and this is a comment on training, because it becomes very difficult

257
00:17:57.68 --> 00:18:03.52
when you think about training people for situations that are unknown.

258
00:18:03.52 --> 00:18:07.56
It's easy to train something people for something that they know is going to happen,

259
00:18:07.56 --> 00:18:11.76
but it's a lot more difficult to train people for something that is unknown, how do you do

260
00:18:11.76 --> 00:18:13.24
that?

261
00:18:13.24 --> 00:18:19.76
As we get into the discussion of training a little bit, the small unit into the book here,

262
00:18:19.76 --> 00:18:25.88
the small unit that too faithfully follows the method in the book will eventually attempt

263
00:18:25.88 --> 00:18:28.16
it under the wrong conditions.

264
00:18:28.16 --> 00:18:35.72
Furthermore, the unit may have difficulty surprising any enemy who has read their book.

265
00:18:35.72 --> 00:18:36.96
That makes sense, right?

266
00:18:36.96 --> 00:18:42.04
The enemy is going to know your play, and by the way, all these military manuals can

267
00:18:42.04 --> 00:18:45.68
all be found online, they're online, they're on the internet.

268
00:18:45.68 --> 00:18:49.44
So the enemy definitely reads what we have.

269
00:18:49.44 --> 00:18:53.68
On the other hand, the unit that doesn't prepare for any particular scenario will take

270
00:18:53.68 --> 00:18:56.60
too long to decide what to do.

271
00:18:56.60 --> 00:19:01.64
It's automatically sacrificing surprise to momentum, and then not have the teamwork to execute

272
00:19:01.64 --> 00:19:03.72
what it does decide to do.

273
00:19:03.72 --> 00:19:05.68
So there's two ends of the spectrum.

274
00:19:05.68 --> 00:19:09.68
We talk about the dichotomy and leadership and how you're constantly going against opposing

275
00:19:09.68 --> 00:19:10.68
forces.

276
00:19:10.68 --> 00:19:18.52
You can train so hard and so specifically to what to doctrine that it eliminates your flexibility,

277
00:19:18.52 --> 00:19:27.36
the other end of the spectrum is to not train at all and then you can't execute anything.

278
00:19:27.36 --> 00:19:34.68
And Rommel said the ordinary soldier has a surprisingly good nose for what is true and

279
00:19:34.68 --> 00:19:35.92
what is false.

280
00:19:35.92 --> 00:19:38.48
And that's not just soldiers.

281
00:19:38.48 --> 00:19:44.000
I talked about that before that people know, even if they don't know what the truth is,

282
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.48
they know you're not telling them that.

283
00:19:45.48 --> 00:19:49.60
They may not know what the actual truth is.

284
00:19:49.60 --> 00:19:53.72
And then going back to training, actuality, back to training and back to the book, in

285
00:19:53.72 --> 00:20:01.04
actuality, most small scale combat is one or lost months before the battle during training.

286
00:20:01.04 --> 00:20:04.000
And that's something that people say all the time about martial arts as well.

287
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.04
It's during that training as you prepare, that's what wins the battle.

288
00:20:08.04 --> 00:20:09.04
It's the fight camp.

289
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:20.72
And it's the same thing with military maneuvers.

290
00:20:20.72 --> 00:20:28.88
So as we continue on here, as expected, battlefield conditions change.

291
00:20:28.88 --> 00:20:35.60
So too must learning over alliance on book solutions in itself constitute a shortfall in

292
00:20:35.60 --> 00:20:41.04
training because it minimizes the importance of the unique aspects of each situation.

293
00:20:41.04 --> 00:20:45.68
Blind faith and standard operating procedures doesn't even constitute being well trained.

294
00:20:45.68 --> 00:20:52.88
This is something that when I was running training, we caused complete mayhem on the guys

295
00:20:52.88 --> 00:20:54.52
that were going through training.

296
00:20:54.52 --> 00:20:59.36
And anybody that went through training when I was running it right now as a smile on their

297
00:20:59.36 --> 00:21:07.80
face because they know that they were put into scenarios that were completely confusing,

298
00:21:07.80 --> 00:21:13.28
distracting, disturbing, mayhem chaos.

299
00:21:13.28 --> 00:21:14.60
It was just crazy.

300
00:21:14.60 --> 00:21:20.28
And the reason we did that is because we wanted to test their minds.

301
00:21:20.28 --> 00:21:25.60
Not their standard operating procedures, not their shooting capabilities.

302
00:21:25.60 --> 00:21:28.52
We wanted to test the minds of the leaders.

303
00:21:28.52 --> 00:21:34.96
The leaders be in that chaos, step back from that chaos, either physically or mentally or

304
00:21:34.96 --> 00:21:40.64
both get an assessment of everything that was happening and then say, okay, this is what

305
00:21:40.64 --> 00:21:51.32
we need to do to get out of the situation or improve the situation or win the situation.

306
00:21:51.32 --> 00:21:56.000
What the other thing that it requires, not only is that the leaders step back and have

307
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.12
the ability to step back, but the NCOs, again, these non-commissioned officers must love

308
00:22:01.12 --> 00:22:06.92
initiative and must hold what ground they have to the upmost.

309
00:22:06.92 --> 00:22:12.96
It often happens that a sergeant or even a cropped corporal may decide a battle by boldness

310
00:22:12.96 --> 00:22:16.000
with which he ceases to bid a ground and holds it.

311
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.40
So we tried to inspire the younger guys, the new guys, a guy that had no experience in

312
00:22:21.40 --> 00:22:24.60
the SEAL teams, but we wanted that guy to go, you know what, I'm going to get into this

313
00:22:24.60 --> 00:22:26.80
room, I'm going to take this building, I'm going to get to this rooftop, I'm going to

314
00:22:26.80 --> 00:22:36.92
get this good position and not to do it as a rogue element, but within the confines of

315
00:22:36.92 --> 00:22:39.28
what the strategy was and what the plan was.

316
00:22:39.28 --> 00:22:46.32
And that's where you end up with a unit that works together very well.

317
00:22:46.32 --> 00:22:50.76
And you know, one of the things that I remember of where people get locked into these, you

318
00:22:50.76 --> 00:22:54.56
can see it sometimes in MMA fights, you'll see a fighter that's got a big

319
00:22:54.56 --> 00:23:00.72
good, you know, ground game or all of you's trying to do is take the person down, take

320
00:23:00.72 --> 00:23:05.40
the person down, use all the energy, just keep trying to cleanse, keep shooting shots

321
00:23:05.40 --> 00:23:09.12
and they're getting their shot stuff, but they can't adapt.

322
00:23:09.12 --> 00:23:13.32
They don't have the skills or they don't have the mindset to adapt.

323
00:23:13.32 --> 00:23:20.76
I remember one scenario where we had what's called a bunkered machine gun position, this

324
00:23:20.76 --> 00:23:23.20
is an training, training event.

325
00:23:23.20 --> 00:23:27.84
So there's a long hallway, this is in an urban environment, there's a big giant building,

326
00:23:27.84 --> 00:23:29.40
this is all fake, by the way.

327
00:23:29.40 --> 00:23:35.20
But there's a big giant building and in the end of the hallway, we've got a bad guy

328
00:23:35.20 --> 00:23:37.68
who's in a bunkered position.

329
00:23:37.68 --> 00:23:44.000
So he's in behind tables and drawers and concrete and he's got a fully automatic paint

330
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.08
ball gun.

331
00:23:46.08 --> 00:23:50.44
And the seals are trying to go down the hallway to get him.

332
00:23:50.44 --> 00:23:54.56
And they're shooting at him, but this guy's in a bunkered position, they can't hit him,

333
00:23:54.56 --> 00:23:56.92
he's hidden.

334
00:23:56.92 --> 00:23:59.88
And so every time they come out the hallway to try and move towards him, he just mows him

335
00:23:59.88 --> 00:24:05.72
down and first is one guy, then it's another guy, then three guys, then it's six guys.

336
00:24:05.72 --> 00:24:09.12
Then it's eight guys are laying in the hallway, you know, because every time they get shot

337
00:24:09.12 --> 00:24:12.24
with paintball, if they get shot a few times, we're putting them down.

338
00:24:12.24 --> 00:24:15.80
Like, okay, your dead just lay down, stay there, your dead, stay there, your dead.

339
00:24:15.80 --> 00:24:17.80
Okay, your, oh, you, you're dead too.

340
00:24:17.80 --> 00:24:19.80
They can't believe they just got a lay there.

341
00:24:19.80 --> 00:24:25.88
So I go to the guy that's running it and it was a platoon chief.

342
00:24:25.88 --> 00:24:29.88
And I walked over and I said, hey chief, you know, how's this going to work out?

343
00:24:29.88 --> 00:24:34.80
And he said, we just got a, I got to get these guys moving down this hallway and I said,

344
00:24:34.80 --> 00:24:38.12
do you think there might be another way?

345
00:24:38.12 --> 00:24:42.92
And he kind of looked at me and he realized that, yeah, there's another way.

346
00:24:42.92 --> 00:24:48.12
He sent a couple guys back out of the building, they walked down the outside of the building

347
00:24:48.12 --> 00:24:53.60
to the window where the guy was bunker dead through a couple of grenades in there, jumped

348
00:24:53.60 --> 00:24:55.88
in, killed the guy.

349
00:24:55.88 --> 00:24:59.52
But the mindset wasn't there to have the flexibility to do that.

350
00:24:59.52 --> 00:25:04.12
And that's what we were training because I never wanted to see guys get locked into a situation.

351
00:25:04.12 --> 00:25:05.12
Right.

352
00:25:05.12 --> 00:25:09.56
That's why training, all training needs to expand your brain.

353
00:25:09.56 --> 00:25:13.44
And need to expand your mind into ocean constraint, shouldn't constrain your ideas.

354
00:25:13.44 --> 00:25:18.08
Yeah, it almost seems like that would be a different type of training even.

355
00:25:18.08 --> 00:25:22.32
Almost like you could, like someone's forcing the double leg or something, they're forcing,

356
00:25:22.32 --> 00:25:23.32
they're not getting it.

357
00:25:23.32 --> 00:25:24.32
They're not getting it.

358
00:25:24.32 --> 00:25:26.20
He should have been trained in other take downs.

359
00:25:26.20 --> 00:25:30.76
If in fact taking the guy down was a strategy, he should be trained in other stuff.

360
00:25:30.76 --> 00:25:32.08
Yeah, maybe some judo stuff.

361
00:25:32.08 --> 00:25:33.72
Yeah, no doubt about it.

362
00:25:33.72 --> 00:25:35.32
And this is one thing that's interesting.

363
00:25:35.32 --> 00:25:41.20
I think that's the evolution is you're hearing about Connor McGregor right now and

364
00:25:41.20 --> 00:25:43.32
I hate to jump on the bandwagon.

365
00:25:43.32 --> 00:25:51.04
But you see him doing this movement type drills, which is really good because what is

366
00:25:51.04 --> 00:25:52.04
that doing?

367
00:25:52.04 --> 00:25:55.48
That's training you for these weird situations.

368
00:25:55.48 --> 00:25:59.40
That's another in like with training judo with Jeff Glover.

369
00:25:59.40 --> 00:26:05.28
He puts himself in these weird positions and does these crazy things that when it happens

370
00:26:05.28 --> 00:26:11.44
to him, he just has better reaction because he's used to being in these strange positions.

371
00:26:11.44 --> 00:26:18.84
And when we work with corporations and work with companies, we'll do role-playing with

372
00:26:18.84 --> 00:26:24.64
these CEOs or middle-level managers and we'll play, you know, late for an I will play

373
00:26:24.64 --> 00:26:33.64
the unruly old job site foreman that knows more than you do and how are you going to deal

374
00:26:33.64 --> 00:26:34.64
with them.

375
00:26:34.64 --> 00:26:39.84
And we put them in these hostile situations and do things and say things and that that

376
00:26:39.84 --> 00:26:43.76
throw them for a loop that makes them uncomfortable, that they don't know the solution

377
00:26:43.76 --> 00:26:46.08
to and they have to think on their feet.

378
00:26:46.08 --> 00:26:54.12
And that's one of the pieces of training that I always like to go back to is how can we

379
00:26:54.12 --> 00:27:01.04
do things that surprise people in training so that we exercise their brain?

380
00:27:01.04 --> 00:27:02.28
Not what they know.

381
00:27:02.28 --> 00:27:04.68
We got to get what you know.

382
00:27:04.68 --> 00:27:07.000
You got to train what you know, you got to practice what you know.

383
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.12
How do we train what you don't know, what you don't expect?

384
00:27:10.12 --> 00:27:15.12
Yeah, it's like a deeper, it's like almost like a level deeper in the training.

385
00:27:15.12 --> 00:27:16.72
Like it's like it's real beneficial.

386
00:27:16.72 --> 00:27:21.64
I think I think Henerga is talking about this, training due to the good way to train

387
00:27:21.64 --> 00:27:26.96
for self-defense is training with a real athletic guy who's a white belt.

388
00:27:26.96 --> 00:27:29.76
So you won't do predictable things that you've been training every day.

389
00:27:29.76 --> 00:27:35.52
He'll do unpredictable things where you won't be super easy.

390
00:27:35.52 --> 00:27:39.60
At the same time, it won't be something that you have full knowledge of and full experience.

391
00:27:39.60 --> 00:27:40.76
Yeah.

392
00:27:40.76 --> 00:27:48.16
If you get the 280 pound powerhouse that shows up to the gym that's never trained before,

393
00:27:48.16 --> 00:27:54.96
the first time you train with them, it's going to be harder to catch them than it will

394
00:27:54.96 --> 00:27:55.96
three months later.

395
00:27:55.96 --> 00:27:57.96
No, maybe three months it'll be about the same.

396
00:27:57.96 --> 00:28:02.08
But like a month into it where he kind of knows what he's supposed to try and do.

397
00:28:02.08 --> 00:28:04.32
But you know exactly what he's going to do.

398
00:28:04.32 --> 00:28:05.32
Then it's easy to catch him.

399
00:28:05.32 --> 00:28:06.32
It's easier.

400
00:28:06.32 --> 00:28:07.56
So you're right.

401
00:28:07.56 --> 00:28:10.92
It definitely is a transitional time and it is good to train with people that you have no

402
00:28:10.92 --> 00:28:12.32
idea what they're going to do.

403
00:28:12.32 --> 00:28:13.32
Yeah.

404
00:28:13.32 --> 00:28:15.12
And it's not even to say that, and it does.

405
00:28:15.12 --> 00:28:19.64
It gives you experience with these unorthodox things for sure, but that's not where you're

406
00:28:19.64 --> 00:28:21.28
talking about as far as what's being trained.

407
00:28:21.28 --> 00:28:26.000
What's being trained is not to be so dogmatic in your actions and you're, you know, your

408
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.96
plan is to, this sounds really cliche.

409
00:28:29.96 --> 00:28:31.88
It's to expect the unexpected.

410
00:28:31.88 --> 00:28:32.88
Yeah.

411
00:28:32.88 --> 00:28:35.48
It means you to think that way.

412
00:28:35.48 --> 00:28:36.48
Well, it's true.

413
00:28:36.48 --> 00:28:38.44
And I don't know if this is cliche or not.

414
00:28:38.44 --> 00:28:39.92
I'm pretty sure it is.

415
00:28:39.92 --> 00:28:44.76
But I say this and people kind of freak out when I say it because I'm like a, a, a structure

416
00:28:44.76 --> 00:28:46.32
discipline person.

417
00:28:46.32 --> 00:28:47.64
But I say it all the time.

418
00:28:47.64 --> 00:28:48.64
Free your mind.

419
00:28:48.64 --> 00:28:50.64
You know, you got to free your mind.

420
00:28:50.64 --> 00:28:56.44
That's what, that when I talk about this stuff, I, I hate when I find myself in a situation

421
00:28:56.44 --> 00:28:59.12
where my mind is not free to see what's going on.

422
00:28:59.12 --> 00:29:06.84
And I can't detach from what's known and go and enter the unknown and deal with the unknown.

423
00:29:06.84 --> 00:29:07.84
Yeah.

424
00:29:07.84 --> 00:29:22.68
You know, another thing that can affect this is our ego and how our ego can prevent us from

425
00:29:22.68 --> 00:29:28.24
learning or listening to other people or other schools or other martial arts or other

426
00:29:28.24 --> 00:29:30.16
gyms or other perspectives.

427
00:29:30.16 --> 00:29:31.16
Yeah.

428
00:29:31.16 --> 00:29:40.36
So in this book, the last hundred yards, he talks about that.

429
00:29:40.36 --> 00:29:45.60
Uh, even giving a sister organization with the same manuals credit for knowing anything

430
00:29:45.60 --> 00:29:47.04
can be difficult.

431
00:29:47.04 --> 00:29:52.76
Pride in one's unit can help to build cohesion, but it can also stand in the way of

432
00:29:52.76 --> 00:29:53.76
learning.

433
00:29:53.76 --> 00:29:57.36
Learning must always take priority over pride.

434
00:29:57.36 --> 00:30:02.68
How readily a military organization can assimilate new information establishes how easily

435
00:30:02.68 --> 00:30:06.88
it's component elements can acquire new knowledge.

436
00:30:06.88 --> 00:30:12.44
The Germans of World War I are generally credited with developing the application parameters

437
00:30:12.44 --> 00:30:15.88
that define modern infantry tactics.

438
00:30:15.88 --> 00:30:16.80
Here's how they did it.

439
00:30:16.80 --> 00:30:22.72
The German army of 1914 was the most decentralized in Europe.

440
00:30:22.72 --> 00:30:28.48
Free from all but the most general supervision and relieved by a promotion system that

441
00:30:28.48 --> 00:30:34.36
based, based strictly on seniority of the need to constantly please superiors the German

442
00:30:34.36 --> 00:30:40.04
battalion or company commander was free to train his troops according to his own lights.

443
00:30:40.04 --> 00:30:44.60
So the way they advanced people was just how it wasn't based on how well you did on this

444
00:30:44.60 --> 00:30:45.60
particular thing.

445
00:30:45.60 --> 00:30:47.24
So they weren't kissing ass the whole time.

446
00:30:47.24 --> 00:30:48.64
They were just oh, you were in rank.

447
00:30:48.64 --> 00:30:49.64
You know, you get promoted.

448
00:30:49.64 --> 00:30:53.64
So they were free to kind of operate and do the best they could and that had a big, big

449
00:30:53.64 --> 00:30:56.64
impact.

450
00:30:56.64 --> 00:31:06.72
For example, by 1918 the Germans had line infantry squads that could penetrate allied defense

451
00:31:06.72 --> 00:31:10.68
lines almost at will.

452
00:31:10.68 --> 00:31:16.52
As opposed to, you know, the allies who would always try and coordinate these big giant

453
00:31:16.52 --> 00:31:21.000
massive attacks at the same time and you have to get everyone aligned and you have to execute

454
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.36
perfectly with thousands of people.

455
00:31:23.36 --> 00:31:28.44
That's obviously very challenging rather than just saying, okay, our goal is to break through

456
00:31:28.44 --> 00:31:30.84
the lines going figure it out.

457
00:31:30.84 --> 00:31:36.08
Think of all the different creative ways that go to figure that out and it's crazy.

458
00:31:36.08 --> 00:31:37.68
And that's why it was so successful.

459
00:31:37.68 --> 00:31:39.80
Now the Germans lost.

460
00:31:39.80 --> 00:31:45.20
They obviously made some mistakes on the strategic level.

461
00:31:45.20 --> 00:31:48.16
And as a matter of national policy, they made some pretty big mistakes too.

462
00:31:48.16 --> 00:31:52.96
But that's kind of a whole other, a whole other story.

463
00:31:52.96 --> 00:31:57.52
Most military leaders agree that doing nothing to prepare an infantry squad for combat also

464
00:31:57.52 --> 00:32:01.12
does little to enhance its chances for success.

465
00:32:01.12 --> 00:32:05.12
Most can also agree that providing guidance that is too restrictive may cause the squad

466
00:32:05.12 --> 00:32:08.96
to disregard unforeseen circumstances.

467
00:32:08.96 --> 00:32:11.20
The answer will at must lie somewhere in between.

468
00:32:11.20 --> 00:32:13.84
That's what we've been talking about.

469
00:32:13.84 --> 00:32:22.48
When you see this with fighters as well and you see fighters that prepare for a specific

470
00:32:22.48 --> 00:32:24.12
attack from somebody.

471
00:32:24.12 --> 00:32:27.64
But then that other somebody decides to mix it up and comes out and does something to

472
00:32:27.64 --> 00:32:28.64
the top of it.

473
00:32:28.64 --> 00:32:29.64
And I was cornering fighters before.

474
00:32:29.64 --> 00:32:32.52
We're all gone out and said, oh, I didn't expect that.

475
00:32:32.52 --> 00:32:33.52
Here we go.

476
00:32:33.52 --> 00:32:39.40
This guy just took John Bones just took down DC, like where did that come from?

477
00:32:39.40 --> 00:32:40.40
Why did he do that?

478
00:32:40.40 --> 00:32:46.40
And I see that kind of that mentality that through things often, it puts people in a

479
00:32:46.40 --> 00:32:47.40
predicament.

480
00:32:47.40 --> 00:32:53.000
Yeah, and you mentioned John Jones, he actually even admitted that some of the stuff that

481
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.80
he does, he's never trained for.

482
00:32:54.80 --> 00:32:55.80
He did it.

483
00:32:55.80 --> 00:33:01.28
But it's managed that different, that separate element of your mind or training.

484
00:33:01.28 --> 00:33:05.36
I don't know if you had training doing that or just a creative person or whatever.

485
00:33:05.36 --> 00:33:11.28
If that separate element, it's a whole different part of the strategy.

486
00:33:11.28 --> 00:33:13.08
Yeah, one other asset.

487
00:33:13.08 --> 00:33:17.08
Yeah, and also you can see that he's encouraged by Greg Jackson.

488
00:33:17.08 --> 00:33:21.44
He's encouraged and he does things, you know, he has an open mind.

489
00:33:21.44 --> 00:33:24.52
Right, get a free mind and that goes a long way.

490
00:33:24.52 --> 00:33:25.52
Free mind.

491
00:33:25.52 --> 00:33:26.52
That is kind of a cliche.

492
00:33:26.52 --> 00:33:28.52
By the way, there's a song.

493
00:33:28.52 --> 00:33:31.48
Is it a free mind and the rest will fall out?

494
00:33:31.48 --> 00:33:33.12
Or something else will fall out in other words?

495
00:33:33.12 --> 00:33:34.48
I'm not familiar with that.

496
00:33:34.48 --> 00:33:35.48
Free.

497
00:33:35.48 --> 00:33:39.04
Let's not say it.

498
00:33:39.04 --> 00:33:44.84
So, finally to talk about decentralized command and what I would see happen with decentralized

499
00:33:44.84 --> 00:33:45.84
command.

500
00:33:45.84 --> 00:33:49.48
As I tell some junior leader, okay, you need centralized command, you need to let your

501
00:33:49.48 --> 00:33:53.72
guys go out and do what they need to do and they go out on the battlefield and this

502
00:33:53.72 --> 00:33:58.08
is it getting in training where no one's going to die.

503
00:33:58.08 --> 00:33:59.08
They go out.

504
00:33:59.08 --> 00:34:01.32
All the little leaders would get their own idea and they go and try and make all the stuff

505
00:34:01.32 --> 00:34:06.88
and happen and the commander would lose control and everyone would get crushed and shot up

506
00:34:06.88 --> 00:34:12.76
with paintball in the whole mind yards and they come back and it's early to why I did decentralized

507
00:34:12.76 --> 00:34:13.76
command.

508
00:34:13.76 --> 00:34:15.28
It doesn't work, see?

509
00:34:15.28 --> 00:34:22.48
And I would say enough, you did decentralized command, but you missed the key part of decentralized

510
00:34:22.48 --> 00:34:31.28
command, which is guidance, parameters, understanding of the mission, commanders intent,

511
00:34:31.28 --> 00:34:38.52
standard operating procedures, limits of advance, all these nice little restrictions that

512
00:34:38.52 --> 00:34:40.000
you put on the guys.

513
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.96
Now, there are wide restrictions, I shouldn't have said little.

514
00:34:42.96 --> 00:34:43.96
There are wide restrictions.

515
00:34:43.96 --> 00:34:48.76
They give them a lot of mobility, but they understand what the objective is, what the

516
00:34:48.76 --> 00:34:52.92
end state is, what their parameters are, how far they can maneuver.

517
00:34:52.92 --> 00:34:56.16
Like they can know, they can, hey, if you can't go past this building, you can't go past

518
00:34:56.16 --> 00:35:01.24
this road, you can't go wherever you draw those lines so that they can operate

519
00:35:01.24 --> 00:35:03.20
freely within those lines.

520
00:35:03.20 --> 00:35:07.36
And that's how they're made, that's how you maintain control with decentralized command.

521
00:35:07.36 --> 00:35:13.64
When you call them like guidelines, or yes, because when you say operate within those lines,

522
00:35:13.64 --> 00:35:18.52
is it pretty encouraged to stay within those lines with their creativity or does the

523
00:35:18.52 --> 00:35:20.88
creativity, is that allowed to kind of overflow?

524
00:35:20.88 --> 00:35:26.16
Like if you say, you know how far you can engage there, are you saying there are no exceptions?

525
00:35:26.16 --> 00:35:27.16
No, I'm not.

526
00:35:27.16 --> 00:35:32.76
If I call you up and say echo, I'm a building 14 right now, we see enemy moving to building

527
00:35:32.76 --> 00:35:33.76
27.

528
00:35:33.76 --> 00:35:36.40
I want to push down this road, or we good to do that.

529
00:35:36.40 --> 00:35:38.20
If you say, all right, let me check the map.

530
00:35:38.20 --> 00:35:39.44
Let me check where I'm at the forces are at.

531
00:35:39.44 --> 00:35:41.20
Yep, we're good to go.

532
00:35:41.20 --> 00:35:42.20
You can move.

533
00:35:42.20 --> 00:35:46.16
So, there are times where I have to check back with you to make sure we're good to go and

534
00:35:46.16 --> 00:35:50.08
make sure that you understand, but I'm going beyond what parameters we're set and that's

535
00:35:50.08 --> 00:35:51.24
why I have to communicate you.

536
00:35:51.24 --> 00:35:53.36
But I went all the way up to that point.

537
00:35:53.36 --> 00:35:58.40
I'm maneuvered on the battlefield for, you know, three, four, five, six hours, maybe it

538
00:35:58.40 --> 00:36:03.000
was a day, maybe it was two days without having to say echo, I need some guidance here.

539
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.08
Echo, I'm going to pitch beyond what you told me.

540
00:36:05.08 --> 00:36:10.72
Yes, so these guidelines are kind of you going with the knowledge that there are exceptions

541
00:36:10.72 --> 00:36:12.08
as long as they're responsible.

542
00:36:12.08 --> 00:36:13.08
Yes.

543
00:36:13.08 --> 00:36:16.12
Or as long as what you do, you'd be responsible about making those exceptions.

544
00:36:16.12 --> 00:36:17.12
And communicate.

545
00:36:17.12 --> 00:36:18.72
You know, that's when bad things happen.

546
00:36:18.72 --> 00:36:22.04
When bad things happen is when you go outside the limitations that you're supposed to be

547
00:36:22.04 --> 00:36:27.12
in and you don't tell anybody that's very, very problematic.

548
00:36:27.12 --> 00:36:35.72
Now, when we talk about why it's so, why you have to maintain that flexibility.

549
00:36:35.72 --> 00:36:42.92
The reason is because combat is infinitely complex.

550
00:36:42.92 --> 00:36:46.68
And it's one of those dichotomies because it's infinitely simple, but it's infinitely complex.

551
00:36:46.68 --> 00:36:51.36
And believe me, the complexity of it got me, got the best of me on many occasions where

552
00:36:51.36 --> 00:36:55.76
I was, where I lost it, I did not, could not fall the complexity situation.

553
00:36:55.76 --> 00:36:57.80
I had to bad things happen.

554
00:36:57.80 --> 00:36:58.80
I had to regroup.

555
00:36:58.80 --> 00:36:59.80
I had to try and figure them out.

556
00:36:59.80 --> 00:37:03.08
I had to assemble these thoughts in my head as all this thing.

557
00:37:03.08 --> 00:37:05.20
All these things are happening.

558
00:37:05.20 --> 00:37:12.84
Going to the book as it relates to combat, the term situation encompasses many variables.

559
00:37:12.84 --> 00:37:21.12
Mission, enemy, terrain, weather, troops, and fire support, time, space, logistics.

560
00:37:21.12 --> 00:37:23.68
Each category has many facets.

561
00:37:23.68 --> 00:37:31.88
Disregarding a seemingly inconsequential circumstance can invalidate and otherwise logical solution.

562
00:37:31.88 --> 00:37:40.12
One must continually study the possibilities, continually study the possibilities.

563
00:37:40.12 --> 00:37:51.08
And I've seen that where one little problem can escalate into all kinds of problems.

564
00:37:51.08 --> 00:37:55.88
That's something that whether it's a unit that we did just what we just talked about, which

565
00:37:55.88 --> 00:37:58.64
is you know, you know, unit that goes where they weren't supposed to be and they didn't

566
00:37:58.64 --> 00:38:02.44
tell anybody, that can become very problematic as you can imagine.

567
00:38:02.44 --> 00:38:05.60
Because all of a sudden, you know, you got people shooting from a building where there's

568
00:38:05.60 --> 00:38:06.80
not supposed to be any friendlies.

569
00:38:06.80 --> 00:38:09.32
Well, that's what you're going to shoot back at.

570
00:38:09.32 --> 00:38:12.000
So that's a horrible situation.

571
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.48
Things with communication where some radio frequencies go down or for whatever reason you

572
00:38:18.48 --> 00:38:22.16
lose communications with people and all of a sudden you're in a black hole and you don't

573
00:38:22.16 --> 00:38:23.16
know what's happening.

574
00:38:23.16 --> 00:38:29.32
That's another situation where one little tiny piece can really throw massive complexities

575
00:38:29.32 --> 00:38:37.68
into this situation.

576
00:38:37.68 --> 00:38:42.24
Going back to Rommel and back to training.

577
00:38:42.24 --> 00:38:48.44
The best form of welfare for the troops is first class training.

578
00:38:48.44 --> 00:38:52.56
This saves unnecessary casualties.

579
00:38:52.56 --> 00:38:55.36
And I think I did talk about this before, but taking care of your people, you know, and

580
00:38:55.36 --> 00:39:00.16
how taking care of your people, it can mean, hey, that means we're going to cut them loose

581
00:39:00.16 --> 00:39:02.84
early because that means you're taking care of them.

582
00:39:02.84 --> 00:39:06.36
But the reality is the way you take care of them is to train them hard.

583
00:39:06.36 --> 00:39:07.76
It'd be a discipline.

584
00:39:07.76 --> 00:39:12.16
So I will never lose sight of that one.

585
00:39:12.16 --> 00:39:20.88
This is a skipping around a little bit, but I wanted to throw this in there because

586
00:39:20.88 --> 00:39:25.76
because of the fight we had in Rommel and it's just talking about how the fighting in the

587
00:39:25.76 --> 00:39:29.20
urban environment is so challenging.

588
00:39:29.20 --> 00:39:35.68
And it says in the book, built up areas, meaning cities should be bypassed wherever possible.

589
00:39:35.68 --> 00:39:45.52
In urban terrain, the attacker may need as much as a 10 to 1 man power advantage.

590
00:39:45.52 --> 00:39:53.96
And Sunzu, Rothi Artowar, the worst policy is to attack cities.

591
00:39:53.96 --> 00:39:58.56
And if troops are attacking cities, their strength will be exhausted.

592
00:39:58.56 --> 00:40:05.24
That's just a, for time, a mortal trying to fight in cities is absolutely the most

593
00:40:05.24 --> 00:40:07.84
challenging of all environments.

594
00:40:07.84 --> 00:40:08.84
Why?

595
00:40:08.84 --> 00:40:13.16
Because they're dug in and there's, you know, their little strategy is established.

596
00:40:13.16 --> 00:40:15.16
They're dug in.

597
00:40:15.16 --> 00:40:20.12
They, they are 300 and 60 degrees around you.

598
00:40:20.12 --> 00:40:21.12
Oh, yeah.

599
00:40:21.12 --> 00:40:22.72
They are above you.

600
00:40:22.72 --> 00:40:27.44
They are to the left, to the right in front of you, they're behind you and they're beneath

601
00:40:27.44 --> 00:40:28.44
you.

602
00:40:28.44 --> 00:40:29.44
They're in the sewage systems.

603
00:40:29.44 --> 00:40:31.16
They're in the basements.

604
00:40:31.16 --> 00:40:37.12
So you're in this 360 degree fire zone.

605
00:40:37.12 --> 00:40:42.52
And on top of that, just about every building is a hardened fighting position.

606
00:40:42.52 --> 00:40:43.52
All right.

607
00:40:43.52 --> 00:40:47.48
So, so all you have to do is enter a building and you've got a pill box.

608
00:40:47.48 --> 00:40:49.84
You've got a, you've got a bunker.

609
00:40:49.84 --> 00:40:52.24
And so therefore, it's very, very challenging.

610
00:40:52.24 --> 00:40:56.36
And I just talked about having an enemy machine gun and a bunker fighting position.

611
00:40:56.36 --> 00:40:58.08
That's a nightmare.

612
00:40:58.08 --> 00:41:01.12
It's a little less of a nightmare when you have tanks to come in and block.

613
00:41:01.12 --> 00:41:02.12
That's a lot of the blasts.

614
00:41:02.12 --> 00:41:04.56
So God bless the tankers.

615
00:41:04.56 --> 00:41:06.68
I love those guys.

616
00:41:06.68 --> 00:41:10.92
We worked side by side with those guys.

617
00:41:10.92 --> 00:41:14.08
One, one, AD.

618
00:41:14.08 --> 00:41:18.56
Guys crushed it for us and we appreciated it.

619
00:41:18.56 --> 00:41:24.16
Respect for one and one's enemy is crucial to success on the battlefield.

620
00:41:24.16 --> 00:41:25.48
He is not a coward.

621
00:41:25.48 --> 00:41:26.92
He is not stupid.

622
00:41:26.92 --> 00:41:29.36
And he probably has comparable weaponry.

623
00:41:29.36 --> 00:41:37.08
That's from the book, how to focus on the enemy and make sure that you are respecting

624
00:41:37.08 --> 00:41:39.60
the enemy.

625
00:41:39.60 --> 00:41:44.30
Flexibility to a changing situation again in the book, having the ability to detect and

626
00:41:44.30 --> 00:41:48.28
then react to a changing situation can have great value in war.

627
00:41:48.28 --> 00:41:51.20
What manuals contain is mostly technique, not doctrine.

628
00:41:51.20 --> 00:41:57.84
This technique is merely a framework around which to build common sense solutions.

629
00:41:57.84 --> 00:42:01.52
And what that translates to is discipline equals freedom.

630
00:42:01.52 --> 00:42:04.36
You have these standard operating procedures.

631
00:42:04.36 --> 00:42:08.96
You work them, you refine them, you practice them, you get good at them, but you don't

632
00:42:08.96 --> 00:42:11.52
get stuck with them.

633
00:42:11.52 --> 00:42:14.96
You free your mind by having discipline.

634
00:42:14.96 --> 00:42:19.56
And it means that you can adapt these strict standard operating procedures.

635
00:42:19.56 --> 00:42:23.24
You can adapt them instantaneously and do something else with them because you're a my

636
00:42:23.24 --> 00:42:28.84
stroke and you can make that happen.

637
00:42:28.84 --> 00:42:34.20
Now we get into this and this is going a little bit deep.

638
00:42:34.20 --> 00:42:39.92
But we start talking about something called mission type orders.

639
00:42:39.92 --> 00:42:48.60
And that is different from let's say what would be called a directive where I say echo,

640
00:42:48.60 --> 00:42:50.64
you're going to move down this street.

641
00:42:50.64 --> 00:42:53.92
You're going to take this building number 27.

642
00:42:53.92 --> 00:42:59.96
You're going to set security in there and you're going to hold that position.

643
00:42:59.96 --> 00:43:02.96
That's different because now I've told you exactly what it to do.

644
00:43:02.96 --> 00:43:06.12
I've said, okay, echo, you're going to move down this street.

645
00:43:06.12 --> 00:43:08.68
So I'm telling you which way you're going to go and tell you exactly which building

646
00:43:08.68 --> 00:43:12.24
you're going to take down and I'm telling you to set security in there.

647
00:43:12.24 --> 00:43:17.32
Now what I really want to say is that means you have to do what I just told you.

648
00:43:17.32 --> 00:43:18.32
Because you have no choice.

649
00:43:18.32 --> 00:43:21.92
I mean, I didn't give you any other options. I told you exactly what to do.

650
00:43:21.92 --> 00:43:25.12
Now what if I were to say echo?

651
00:43:25.12 --> 00:43:27.92
We think the enemies over in this area.

652
00:43:27.92 --> 00:43:34.52
We want to be able to hold security on them from an elevated position.

653
00:43:34.52 --> 00:43:37.72
Find a building down there and make that happen.

654
00:43:37.72 --> 00:43:39.72
So now you've got all kinds of freedom.

655
00:43:39.72 --> 00:43:42.08
You might pick 27 because maybe it was the best building.

656
00:43:42.08 --> 00:43:44.44
But maybe 36 wasn't maybe 32 was.

657
00:43:44.44 --> 00:43:46.08
Maybe 27 was hardened.

658
00:43:46.08 --> 00:43:50.56
Maybe it wasn't tall enough. But you have this organic flexibility in your mind

659
00:43:50.56 --> 00:43:55.52
because you've been given a goal of why you're doing the mission.

660
00:43:55.52 --> 00:43:57.04
Not just what to do.

661
00:43:57.04 --> 00:44:00.000
So it's very important when you're dealing with people.

662
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.80
You know, in any walk alive that you tell them not just what they're trying to do.

663
00:44:05.80 --> 00:44:07.36
What to do.

664
00:44:07.36 --> 00:44:08.88
But what they're trying to accomplish.

665
00:44:08.88 --> 00:44:10.000
What the mission is.

666
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.12
Why they are doing it.

667
00:44:12.12 --> 00:44:15.20
And that is incredibly important.

668
00:44:15.20 --> 00:44:19.96
Just like aggressiveness is important.

669
00:44:19.96 --> 00:44:27.08
And going back to the book from General Howlin Mad Smith.

670
00:44:27.08 --> 00:44:32.56
Since I joined the Marines, I have advocated aggressiveness in the field and constant offensive

671
00:44:32.56 --> 00:44:33.72
action.

672
00:44:33.72 --> 00:44:37.28
Hit quickly, hit hard and keep right on hitting.

673
00:44:37.28 --> 00:44:42.40
Give the enemy no rest, no opportunity to consolidate his forces and hit back at you.

674
00:44:42.40 --> 00:44:48.36
This is the shortest road to victory.

675
00:44:48.36 --> 00:44:52.96
Do I need to even expand on that?

676
00:44:52.96 --> 00:45:01.84
I mean, I think how in Mad Smith just hit the nail on the head.

677
00:45:01.84 --> 00:45:05.88
Next point.

678
00:45:05.88 --> 00:45:10.48
Controlling subordinates only to the extent that surprise momentum are not sacrificed.

679
00:45:10.48 --> 00:45:15.24
This analysis becomes so familiar with their leaders intent that they can be trusted to act

680
00:45:15.24 --> 00:45:17.60
on their own initiative.

681
00:45:17.60 --> 00:45:23.20
They should never be required to ask permission to respond to crisis situation.

682
00:45:23.20 --> 00:45:24.88
Seconds count and close combat.

683
00:45:24.88 --> 00:45:29.92
Subordinates must be trusted to act appropriately and only required to inform the leaders

684
00:45:29.92 --> 00:45:32.08
of decisions that might affect others.

685
00:45:32.08 --> 00:45:33.08
That's it.

686
00:45:33.08 --> 00:45:34.48
That's decentralized command.

687
00:45:34.48 --> 00:45:39.44
Now you're going to think at first that this is a little bit of a stretch.

688
00:45:39.44 --> 00:45:41.44
But it's not.

689
00:45:41.44 --> 00:45:46.04
So controlling subordinates only the extent that surprise momentum are not sacrificed.

690
00:45:46.04 --> 00:45:50.52
I'm going to relate that to jujitsu believe it or not.

691
00:45:50.52 --> 00:45:58.36
In jujitsu, in any sport, you have to train your standard operating procedures so that

692
00:45:58.36 --> 00:46:03.68
your body can execute them without directives.

693
00:46:03.68 --> 00:46:09.52
If you have an instinct to defend the arm walk, you will escape the arm walk.

694
00:46:09.52 --> 00:46:13.32
If you do not have that instinct because you're trained enough, you will get caught in the

695
00:46:13.32 --> 00:46:14.32
arm walk.

696
00:46:14.32 --> 00:46:19.04
If you have to think about the move, it is too late.

697
00:46:19.04 --> 00:46:22.28
That's exactly what decentralized command is.

698
00:46:22.28 --> 00:46:28.88
If Eko is out on the battlefield and he gets flanked and he has to ask me what to do,

699
00:46:28.88 --> 00:46:31.08
he's going to get killed.

700
00:46:31.08 --> 00:46:36.48
If Eko is on the map with me and I slap a commura on him and he has to think about

701
00:46:36.48 --> 00:46:38.88
the defense, it's too late.

702
00:46:38.88 --> 00:46:41.40
He's already tapping.

703
00:46:41.40 --> 00:46:47.60
Whereas if I go for the commura and his instinct moves him out of that position, then you

704
00:46:47.60 --> 00:46:51.92
survive.

705
00:46:51.92 --> 00:46:58.72
The one more thing that I think about that type of training is something we should do was

706
00:46:58.72 --> 00:47:00.92
called blender drills.

707
00:47:00.92 --> 00:47:06.68
When you take your seal squad or your seal puttune and you start making calls on him,

708
00:47:06.68 --> 00:47:12.64
flank left, push right, strong right, center peel, you just do the most random calls.

709
00:47:12.64 --> 00:47:15.44
I mean calls.

710
00:47:15.44 --> 00:47:17.16
You're making time to go calls.

711
00:47:17.16 --> 00:47:20.88
You've got 16 guys, they're called immediate action drills.

712
00:47:20.88 --> 00:47:26.16
For instance, if you are patrolling through the desert and you start getting shot at from

713
00:47:26.16 --> 00:47:27.68
the front.

714
00:47:27.68 --> 00:47:32.20
When you do a what's called a contact drill, you're going to react to that contact.

715
00:47:32.20 --> 00:47:33.60
The contact is the enemy.

716
00:47:33.60 --> 00:47:38.92
You're going to do a maneuver as a group and they're all kind of choreographed maneuvers.

717
00:47:38.92 --> 00:47:41.84
Where squad one goes over here squad two goes over here.

718
00:47:41.84 --> 00:47:42.84
We laid on a base of fire.

719
00:47:42.84 --> 00:47:45.52
You start to move, cover and move out.

720
00:47:45.52 --> 00:47:50.20
But what we would do is we would mix up those calls in the middle of one maneuver.

721
00:47:50.20 --> 00:47:55.76
We'd call for another maneuver and in the middle of that one we'd call for another one.

722
00:47:55.76 --> 00:47:58.48
And what it did was it trained the mind.

723
00:47:58.48 --> 00:48:03.68
It trained the minds of the leaders and of the guys to expect the unexpected, as you said earlier

724
00:48:03.68 --> 00:48:05.04
in that clichéed way.

725
00:48:05.04 --> 00:48:07.44
But something that's completely necessary.

726
00:48:07.44 --> 00:48:15.96
Train them to be reactive and open-minded to things that were going to happen.

727
00:48:15.96 --> 00:48:25.24
Now when we talk about learning and this is the title of this chapter.

728
00:48:25.24 --> 00:48:30.68
Then in the book, the last hundred yards, it's called Old Habits, May Get In The Way.

729
00:48:30.68 --> 00:48:32.92
And I think it's pretty obvious what that means.

730
00:48:32.92 --> 00:48:38.44
Adults learn, here it is, adults learn within the context of what they already know.

731
00:48:38.44 --> 00:48:42.76
Ideas that are too far removed from their personal frames of reference are hard for them

732
00:48:42.76 --> 00:48:43.76
to accept.

733
00:48:43.76 --> 00:48:46.20
How often do we see that?

734
00:48:46.20 --> 00:48:53.56
We see it in life, we see it in the business world, we see it in combat, we see it in training.

735
00:48:53.56 --> 00:48:59.28
Ideas that are too far removed from people's personal frame of reference are hard for them

736
00:48:59.28 --> 00:49:01.92
to accept.

737
00:49:01.92 --> 00:49:06.60
Unfortunately, when one gets dropped into a hot landing zone on his first day in combat,

738
00:49:06.60 --> 00:49:09.32
it's often too late for him to learn anymore.

739
00:49:09.32 --> 00:49:15.76
For this reason, infantry must continually reassess and expand their frames of reference.

740
00:49:15.76 --> 00:49:16.76
Boom.

741
00:49:16.76 --> 00:49:19.16
Hello, life.

742
00:49:19.16 --> 00:49:25.16
For this reason, infantrymen and everybody else in the world must continually reassess

743
00:49:25.16 --> 00:49:29.12
and expand their frames of reference.

744
00:49:29.12 --> 00:49:30.60
Everybody.

745
00:49:30.60 --> 00:49:34.92
When one's survival is at stake, the other way can hold as much appeal as the established

746
00:49:34.92 --> 00:49:35.92
way.

747
00:49:35.92 --> 00:49:41.88
So, clearly, we see people in the business world stuck in that right all the time, we

748
00:49:41.88 --> 00:49:46.04
see people in their personal lives, they get stuck in a rut all the time.

749
00:49:46.04 --> 00:49:51.80
So everybody has got to continually reassess and expand their frame of reference.

750
00:49:51.80 --> 00:49:53.96
Going back to the book.

751
00:49:53.96 --> 00:49:59.68
What adults know comes primarily from two sources, what they have been told and what they

752
00:49:59.68 --> 00:50:01.24
have experienced personally.

753
00:50:01.24 --> 00:50:03.24
Okay, that's pretty clear, right?

754
00:50:03.24 --> 00:50:06.24
I think that's pretty obvious, but this is when it gets pretty cool.

755
00:50:06.24 --> 00:50:12.08
They sometimes have difficulty keeping the two sense of ideas separated, becoming convinced

756
00:50:12.08 --> 00:50:16.72
that what they have been told is true, even though they have never personally experienced

757
00:50:16.72 --> 00:50:18.36
it.

758
00:50:18.36 --> 00:50:23.44
And that is something that you see in the military.

759
00:50:23.44 --> 00:50:30.28
You see in the military where guys kind of, they hear something, they make it into something

760
00:50:30.28 --> 00:50:32.12
that they think that they've experienced.

761
00:50:32.12 --> 00:50:36.20
I know it sounds crazy, but they do it.

762
00:50:36.20 --> 00:50:40.08
And that's dangerous.

763
00:50:40.08 --> 00:50:41.08
It's dangerous.

764
00:50:41.08 --> 00:50:48.32
I never, when I realized that that happened, when I realized that that was going on, I was

765
00:50:48.32 --> 00:50:54.12
very suspect of everything that got said.

766
00:50:54.12 --> 00:50:59.36
I was very suspect and said, well, let's make sure that we confirm these ideas before we

767
00:50:59.36 --> 00:51:00.36
just run out and do them.

768
00:51:00.36 --> 00:51:04.44
Does that kind of like those martial arts demonstrations, right?

769
00:51:04.44 --> 00:51:05.44
Exactly.

770
00:51:05.44 --> 00:51:06.44
Exactly.

771
00:51:06.44 --> 00:51:12.68
But before the UFC and before you actually putting two humans in a cage to brawl, it was

772
00:51:12.68 --> 00:51:14.20
all theoretical.

773
00:51:14.20 --> 00:51:15.88
And if someone said, you know what?

774
00:51:15.88 --> 00:51:20.24
If you strike the person here in the neck, they will fall down.

775
00:51:20.24 --> 00:51:23.68
And this is, people legitimately believe that.

776
00:51:23.68 --> 00:51:26.32
Hey, if you hit the person in the neck, there's a break-y on the earth and it'll go down

777
00:51:26.32 --> 00:51:28.08
to the sky, so I'm so afraid.

778
00:51:28.08 --> 00:51:29.56
And they will immediately fall down.

779
00:51:29.56 --> 00:51:32.24
And people believe that, but they never tried it, but they believed it.

780
00:51:32.24 --> 00:51:36.80
And there was a lot of the times those stories were mixed in with someone that had been told

781
00:51:36.80 --> 00:51:40.44
that they'd seen it one time or they experienced it or whatever.

782
00:51:40.44 --> 00:51:47.000
And so that's a good point.

783
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.76
And this is when you get into people that are not telling the whole story.

784
00:51:52.76 --> 00:51:55.12
And this is something I'm very careful of.

785
00:51:55.12 --> 00:52:00.32
Is when I know something, like, I never claimed to know anything 100 percent.

786
00:52:00.32 --> 00:52:05.36
And I will always caveat everything with, you know, like a 99.9 percent.

787
00:52:05.36 --> 00:52:08.16
But there's sometimes what I'm giving information.

788
00:52:08.16 --> 00:52:11.12
And I'm saying, look, this is not 100 percent.

789
00:52:11.12 --> 00:52:12.76
I don't know this for sure.

790
00:52:12.76 --> 00:52:15.08
But this is what I've seen and this is what I've experienced.

791
00:52:15.08 --> 00:52:18.44
Sometimes I'm like, hey, listen, I know this.

792
00:52:18.44 --> 00:52:20.28
And I have experienced it.

793
00:52:20.28 --> 00:52:22.28
And this is what will work.

794
00:52:22.28 --> 00:52:29.08
And I, I definitely, when I was instructing in the sealed teams, I was very clear when

795
00:52:29.08 --> 00:52:30.28
I was saying, hey, I have to say,

796
00:52:30.28 --> 00:52:34.72
I've not done that type of mission before or I have not done this in combat or I've not

797
00:52:34.72 --> 00:52:36.76
seen how this would really work.

798
00:52:36.76 --> 00:52:38.20
But here's what I think.

799
00:52:38.20 --> 00:52:40.88
Because that's a lot different than this is what you need to do.

800
00:52:40.88 --> 00:52:42.000
Because I have seen it.

801
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
I have done it.

802
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.28
And I do know confidently that borrowing the common sense, this is how you should execute

803
00:52:49.28 --> 00:52:50.28
this.

804
00:52:50.28 --> 00:52:52.44
So sources back to the book.

805
00:52:52.44 --> 00:52:57.48
Sources have many reasons for not disclosing every facet of an issue.

806
00:52:57.48 --> 00:53:01.04
One is to propound more convincingly their perspective.

807
00:53:01.04 --> 00:53:06.52
Infantrymen can't afford to harbor points of view that aren't well-founded.

808
00:53:06.52 --> 00:53:10.56
They need continually to reassess their viewpoint and expand their frames of reference to

809
00:53:10.56 --> 00:53:16.40
encompassing in forter knowledge from around the world and across centuries.

810
00:53:16.40 --> 00:53:18.84
Awesome.

811
00:53:18.84 --> 00:53:20.60
Free your mind.

812
00:53:20.60 --> 00:53:26.28
Is that kind of like looking something up on Google or on the internet?

813
00:53:26.28 --> 00:53:34.24
And then the difference between just going with that first answer and going with a bunch

814
00:53:34.24 --> 00:53:35.68
of results, bunch of websites.

815
00:53:35.68 --> 00:53:36.68
Yeah.

816
00:53:36.68 --> 00:53:42.76
And people that see something on the internet and then talk about it as if they know

817
00:53:42.76 --> 00:53:43.76
it firsthand.

818
00:53:43.76 --> 00:53:44.76
Right.

819
00:53:44.76 --> 00:53:46.80
When they read it on their first result, they got clicked on it.

820
00:53:46.80 --> 00:53:47.80
Boom, there's your answer.

821
00:53:47.80 --> 00:53:48.80
Yeah.

822
00:53:48.80 --> 00:53:51.28
Those people out there, we don't like it.

823
00:53:51.28 --> 00:53:53.76
You're clouding the truth.

824
00:53:53.76 --> 00:53:58.80
Okay, getting into some leadership and really life choices.

825
00:53:58.80 --> 00:54:03.40
Then you can apply these to life, you can apply these to business.

826
00:54:03.40 --> 00:54:06.72
Here are some choices that humans have to make.

827
00:54:06.72 --> 00:54:13.08
Protect the status quo or take risks necessary to win decisively.

828
00:54:13.08 --> 00:54:15.12
That speaks on its own.

829
00:54:15.12 --> 00:54:20.36
Protecting the status quo can be easier than changing it to take action one risks making

830
00:54:20.36 --> 00:54:21.36
mistake.

831
00:54:21.36 --> 00:54:23.88
So that's a choice.

832
00:54:23.88 --> 00:54:25.04
And it's not a black and white choice.

833
00:54:25.04 --> 00:54:26.64
There's a lot of shades of gray in there.

834
00:54:26.64 --> 00:54:28.68
And how can you modulate that choice?

835
00:54:28.68 --> 00:54:32.44
But it is a choice that you have to be aware of.

836
00:54:32.44 --> 00:54:37.92
Focus in words to prevent mistakes or on the enemy to keep pace with a changing situation.

837
00:54:37.92 --> 00:54:43.36
This is an interesting professional professionals of all types try to minimize errors.

838
00:54:43.36 --> 00:54:48.76
Unfortunately, trying to do trying too hard to do so in the military, profession has

839
00:54:48.76 --> 00:54:54.48
some serious tradeoffs, initiative, ability to surprise when adversary, perspective on the

840
00:54:54.48 --> 00:54:57.44
overall picture and learning just to name a few.

841
00:54:57.44 --> 00:55:01.32
And I would say that those are the exact same in any profession.

842
00:55:01.32 --> 00:55:06.28
That when you, when you are only focused on not making mistakes, how are you going to make

843
00:55:06.28 --> 00:55:08.28
any risks?

844
00:55:08.28 --> 00:55:10.28
You, you do do do.

845
00:55:10.28 --> 00:55:11.28
Right.

846
00:55:11.28 --> 00:55:13.08
The minute that you're just like, hey, I'm going to go with what I know.

847
00:55:13.08 --> 00:55:15.08
And I am so guilty of this.

848
00:55:15.08 --> 00:55:24.76
I am the guiltyest of all in that I'm very set in my ways in the moves that I do.

849
00:55:24.76 --> 00:55:31.28
I do four submissions, maybe even two.

850
00:55:31.28 --> 00:55:35.36
But they're like, what I'm good at, so I do them a lot.

851
00:55:35.36 --> 00:55:36.76
And I go through phases.

852
00:55:36.76 --> 00:55:38.44
And I shouldn't even say it's phases.

853
00:55:38.44 --> 00:55:42.08
I go through days where I take a lot of risks and I learn more.

854
00:55:42.08 --> 00:55:46.84
And then I go through days where I'm just there because I have to train and I'm going to

855
00:55:46.84 --> 00:55:49.32
do what I do and what I'm going to do and I do well.

856
00:55:49.32 --> 00:55:50.32
But that's not when I learn.

857
00:55:50.32 --> 00:55:51.80
That's not when I get better.

858
00:55:51.80 --> 00:56:00.40
I get better when I'm trying something new and that applies to everything in life.

859
00:56:00.40 --> 00:56:05.72
Key to an infantry man's ability to react to whatever confronts him is as authority to exercise

860
00:56:05.72 --> 00:56:10.52
some initiative.

861
00:56:10.52 --> 00:56:13.80
You've got to give your people the freedom to maneuver.

862
00:56:13.80 --> 00:56:15.40
You have to.

863
00:56:15.40 --> 00:56:19.48
In combat, the leader must personally supervise only those actions that jeopardize the

864
00:56:19.48 --> 00:56:24.48
overall mission and then allow subordinates to exercise initiative and make a few mistakes

865
00:56:24.48 --> 00:56:26.20
on everything else.

866
00:56:26.20 --> 00:56:33.32
Those subordinates must be able to identify mistakes as they happen without fear of punishment.

867
00:56:33.32 --> 00:56:35.08
Or the same mistakes will happen again.

868
00:56:35.08 --> 00:56:38.56
This is making mistakes without fear of punishment.

869
00:56:38.56 --> 00:56:43.92
You know, Dean, buddy, Dean, Lister, he does these drills.

870
00:56:43.92 --> 00:56:46.72
He calls consequence free drills.

871
00:56:46.72 --> 00:56:50.92
Where he just says, okay, you're going to start, you know, that's almost going to be on

872
00:56:50.92 --> 00:56:54.72
your back and you're going to try to escape, but doesn't matter.

873
00:56:54.72 --> 00:56:55.72
Doesn't matter what happens.

874
00:56:55.72 --> 00:56:58.84
If they submit to you doesn't matter, just doesn't matter.

875
00:56:58.84 --> 00:56:59.84
Consequence free drills.

876
00:56:59.84 --> 00:57:05.84
It's just to take chances because all of us, you know, we all hate getting tapped out.

877
00:57:05.84 --> 00:57:08.24
We all hate giving up position.

878
00:57:08.24 --> 00:57:09.24
So you do these consequence free drills.

879
00:57:09.24 --> 00:57:12.24
You go, okay, I look at the guy and I'm like, okay, you're going to tap me out so

880
00:57:12.24 --> 00:57:13.24
big deal.

881
00:57:13.24 --> 00:57:14.24
You know, so do.

882
00:57:14.24 --> 00:57:15.72
I'm going to try crazy stuff.

883
00:57:15.72 --> 00:57:16.72
And that's what they're saying here.

884
00:57:16.72 --> 00:57:19.28
You got to give people the chances to make mistakes.

885
00:57:19.28 --> 00:57:20.28
Yeah.

886
00:57:20.28 --> 00:57:26.24
And that's an actually an important one because how that applies to life.

887
00:57:26.24 --> 00:57:28.88
That applies to life.

888
00:57:28.88 --> 00:57:29.88
Right when you're born.

889
00:57:29.88 --> 00:57:33.12
When you're, when you're like, if you're, let's say you're parenting style.

890
00:57:33.12 --> 00:57:37.76
If you have that parenting style where it could make some mistake, he spills his milk,

891
00:57:37.76 --> 00:57:39.32
or he's trying something new.

892
00:57:39.32 --> 00:57:42.32
He makes a mistake and he gets punished for it.

893
00:57:42.32 --> 00:57:45.16
And that's how he's raised.

894
00:57:45.16 --> 00:57:52.44
When he grows up, he's going to be very reluctant to try new things in life or explore certain,

895
00:57:52.44 --> 00:57:58.44
you know, aspects of, of creativity, namely starting his own business.

896
00:57:58.44 --> 00:58:01.04
That's why most people don't start their own business because they've lived that kind

897
00:58:01.04 --> 00:58:02.04
of.

898
00:58:02.04 --> 00:58:04.44
I think most of us have lived that kind of life where if you make a mistake when you're

899
00:58:04.44 --> 00:58:06.76
a kid, you get punished for it.

900
00:58:06.76 --> 00:58:07.76
You get it in school.

901
00:58:07.76 --> 00:58:11.000
When you make a mistake on your test, you get that red ax on the thing.

902
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.76
You got five wrong, not a ten.

903
00:58:12.76 --> 00:58:13.76
You got a 50 pre.

904
00:58:13.76 --> 00:58:15.76
You got an F.

905
00:58:15.76 --> 00:58:16.76
There's your punishment.

906
00:58:16.76 --> 00:58:18.76
Your F. Oh wait, I don't know these five things.

907
00:58:18.76 --> 00:58:21.76
Can I learn to all take the test again and show you that I don't know?

908
00:58:21.76 --> 00:58:24.76
No, you got an F. There's your punishment.

909
00:58:24.76 --> 00:58:26.76
Repeat the grade.

910
00:58:26.76 --> 00:58:27.76
The socks.

911
00:58:27.76 --> 00:58:29.76
There's your, so you don't even want to make any mistakes.

912
00:58:29.76 --> 00:58:31.76
You don't want to try anything new.

913
00:58:31.76 --> 00:58:33.76
You don't want to, and you just have that mindset.

914
00:58:33.76 --> 00:58:35.76
And that's what most people are like that.

915
00:58:35.76 --> 00:58:40.32
Just however, a point where people, you know, you could be raised in the way where you're

916
00:58:40.32 --> 00:58:44.52
not responsible for your own actions because there's no consequences to what you do.

917
00:58:44.52 --> 00:58:48.08
So if you don't study and you get the red X is all over your test and you don't receive

918
00:58:48.08 --> 00:58:49.76
any punishment for it.

919
00:58:49.76 --> 00:58:50.76
Right.

920
00:58:50.76 --> 00:58:51.76
You will never learn.

921
00:58:51.76 --> 00:58:56.76
Because only he who suffers remembers.

922
00:58:56.76 --> 00:58:58.76
Right, but there's a difference in you.

923
00:58:58.76 --> 00:59:02.76
This is, I don't know, it always comes back to that dichotomy that you talk about.

924
00:59:02.76 --> 00:59:05.76
Where it's, it's really in the middle area.

925
00:59:05.76 --> 00:59:12.76
So, I think that it has to be leading towards that.

926
00:59:12.76 --> 00:59:15.76
What you're saying, let them give them freedom to operate.

927
00:59:15.76 --> 00:59:19.76
If you make a mistake, but they're putting effort into it, that should be commended.

928
00:59:19.76 --> 00:59:23.76
Don't, if you get one wrong, too wrong, don't give them this trophy that says,

929
00:59:23.76 --> 00:59:26.76
Hey, congratulations, you failed.

930
00:59:26.76 --> 00:59:31.76
A failure should, should be, I mean, the goal, right, is to, to make successful people.

931
00:59:31.76 --> 00:59:37.76
I will, I will, despite what I said or in, in conjunction with what I said about their

932
00:59:37.76 --> 00:59:42.76
needing to be consequences, I agree that the correct answer or the correct reaction

933
00:59:42.76 --> 00:59:49.76
would not be you failed, you're horrible, but you failed what did you learn?

934
00:59:49.76 --> 00:59:50.76
Yeah.

935
00:59:50.76 --> 00:59:51.76
How can we improve?

936
00:59:51.76 --> 00:59:53.76
Yes, exactly, exactly right.

937
00:59:53.76 --> 00:59:56.76
So you notice that was exactly exactly.

938
00:59:56.76 --> 00:59:58.76
Double, double, exactly right.

939
00:59:58.76 --> 00:59:59.76
Yeah, for sure.

940
00:59:59.76 --> 01:00:04.76
They kind of get the best of both worlds, where they get that, that, that, the fact that

941
01:00:04.76 --> 01:00:06.76
they failed, they understand that.

942
01:00:06.76 --> 01:00:10.76
And of course, no one's just, like, the, no one's goal is to fail.

943
01:00:10.76 --> 01:00:15.76
So, they know that they failed, they understand that they failed, but encouraged to improve

944
01:00:15.76 --> 01:00:18.76
and encouraged to understand.

945
01:00:18.76 --> 01:00:21.76
But I think, in a lot of ways, people don't get that.

946
01:00:21.76 --> 01:00:26.76
Yeah, well, you definitely don't see it when in businesses, you definitely don't see it

947
01:00:26.76 --> 01:00:28.76
in the military.

948
01:00:28.76 --> 01:00:30.76
And so, yeah, you're right, you got to encourage that.

949
01:00:30.76 --> 01:00:35.76
Well, yeah, and I think it could get, and it's just me speaking from zero experience,

950
01:00:35.76 --> 01:00:39.76
but I would imagine that it would get really rigid in the military, because the stakes

951
01:00:39.76 --> 01:00:41.76
are a lot higher.

952
01:00:41.76 --> 01:00:43.76
Well, that's why this is talking about training.

953
01:00:43.76 --> 01:00:44.76
Yeah.

954
01:00:44.76 --> 01:00:46.76
You don't want to let people make those kind of mistakes in combat.

955
01:00:46.76 --> 01:00:50.76
You won't give them that much rope, or they can get somebody killed in combat.

956
01:00:50.76 --> 01:00:51.76
Yeah.

957
01:00:51.76 --> 01:00:57.76
Yeah, and a training in, in, in, in life, in a learning situation, or a developing phase,

958
01:00:57.76 --> 01:00:59.76
which in life really is your whole life.

959
01:00:59.76 --> 01:01:00.76
Yeah.

960
01:01:00.76 --> 01:01:01.76
So always learning.

961
01:01:01.76 --> 01:01:02.76
Always learning.

962
01:01:02.76 --> 01:01:08.76
So I think, to stick to that, I don't know, format whatever you want to call it, to stick

963
01:01:08.76 --> 01:01:10.76
to that, where understanding of mistakes.

964
01:01:10.76 --> 01:01:15.76
Don't, like, I'm a stake, I'll legitimate mistake.

965
01:01:15.76 --> 01:01:18.76
The punishment should not be the significant part of that experience.

966
01:01:18.76 --> 01:01:22.76
The learning should be, and, hey, look, I understand this different philosophies.

967
01:01:22.76 --> 01:01:23.76
No, there's just gotta be.

968
01:01:23.76 --> 01:01:24.76
There's gotta be some consequences.

969
01:01:24.76 --> 01:01:26.76
Some people don't learn without consequences.

970
01:01:26.76 --> 01:01:27.76
Right.

971
01:01:27.76 --> 01:01:32.76
These days with these, some of the new generation, which you, you might even be a part of.

972
01:01:32.76 --> 01:01:37.76
But the, you know, the new generation that grows up consequence for yous, and they don't,

973
01:01:37.76 --> 01:01:39.76
taking responsibility for actions.

974
01:01:39.76 --> 01:01:43.76
They don't take ownership of anything that goes wrong, because they've been raised in a way

975
01:01:43.76 --> 01:01:47.76
where failure doesn't matter, and there's no consequences to their actions.

976
01:01:47.76 --> 01:01:48.76
Yeah.

977
01:01:48.76 --> 01:01:50.76
So, absolutely, too.

978
01:01:50.76 --> 01:01:53.76
Not to beat a dead her horse on this subject.

979
01:01:53.76 --> 01:01:57.76
I had some notes in here around this from the book.

980
01:01:57.76 --> 01:02:03.76
Trying too hard to follow the book, while solving battlefield situations makes one fairly predictable,

981
01:02:03.76 --> 01:02:06.76
even to enemies who haven't read the book.

982
01:02:06.76 --> 01:02:13.76
These don't, you see, you have to make some changes, and back to the book, these don't have to be drastically different from what's in the book.

983
01:02:13.76 --> 01:02:20.76
Often, it's enough to just a very amount of speed, stealth, or deception, with which the standard method is executed.

984
01:02:20.76 --> 01:02:27.76
Standardizing what subordinates practice in peacetime may make those subordinates easier to control,

985
01:02:27.76 --> 01:02:33.76
but does not help them learn the alternative techniques needed to develop momentum in battle.

986
01:02:33.76 --> 01:02:36.76
So, that actually supports your last statement.

987
01:02:36.76 --> 01:02:43.76
Is it standardizing what subordinates practice in peacetime may make those subordinates easier to control?

988
01:02:43.76 --> 01:02:47.76
So, if you're trying to control someone by beating them down and saying,

989
01:02:47.76 --> 01:02:51.76
you failed, you need to do it this way, and it's the only way, you're going to get more control over them,

990
01:02:51.76 --> 01:02:57.76
but you're going to not allow them to operate in a real world where they have to think of new ideas and think of,

991
01:02:57.76 --> 01:02:59.76
think they have to free their mind.

992
01:02:59.76 --> 01:03:05.76
Yeah, and in a way, you might, I would, I apologize, you might not even get the best out of them.

993
01:03:05.76 --> 01:03:06.76
Really?

994
01:03:06.76 --> 01:03:07.76
I believe you are.

995
01:03:07.76 --> 01:03:11.76
Then we'd get that that rigid standard of output, and that's kind of it.

996
01:03:11.76 --> 01:03:20.76
And going to a quote from the book, supporting your hypothesis from Colonel Merit A. Edson.

997
01:03:20.76 --> 01:03:25.76
He goes on about how you need to fight the Japanese, and he closes with,

998
01:03:25.76 --> 01:03:35.76
encourage your individuals and bring them out, which is just a beautiful statement.

999
01:03:35.76 --> 01:03:41.76
Now, this is kind of to close out this section here.

1000
01:03:41.76 --> 01:03:47.76
We're talking about, and this definitely applies to life.

1001
01:03:47.76 --> 01:03:59.76
Human beings are always trying to structure the chaos of battle, and that may be the root of the problem.

1002
01:03:59.76 --> 01:04:03.76
Human beings, human beings, want to have structure.

1003
01:04:03.76 --> 01:04:07.76
They want things to be orderly, and combat is not orderly.

1004
01:04:07.76 --> 01:04:10.76
Nor is life.

1005
01:04:10.76 --> 01:04:12.76
Nor are relationships.

1006
01:04:12.76 --> 01:04:14.76
Nor are business deals.

1007
01:04:14.76 --> 01:04:15.76
Yeah.

1008
01:04:15.76 --> 01:04:17.76
Nor is the chain of command.

1009
01:04:17.76 --> 01:04:24.76
Nor are personalities and egos, and everything that we try and do to control this chaos.

1010
01:04:24.76 --> 01:04:31.76
The idea that we can control it is false.

1011
01:04:31.76 --> 01:04:35.76
What you have to do is you have to deal with it.

1012
01:04:35.76 --> 01:04:39.76
You have to let that thing squirm underneath you.

1013
01:04:39.76 --> 01:04:44.76
You have to let it move and see where its weaknesses are, and grab hold of what you can and let go of what you can't.

1014
01:04:44.76 --> 01:04:47.76
It's kind of like a universe of physio balls.

1015
01:04:47.76 --> 01:04:49.76
They're kind of, they're not rigid enough.

1016
01:04:49.76 --> 01:04:52.76
Well, I always talk about what I'm training with someone that's bigger than me.

1017
01:04:52.76 --> 01:04:54.76
You get on top.

1018
01:04:54.76 --> 01:04:55.76
You can't hold them down.

1019
01:04:55.76 --> 01:04:57.76
You have to let them move underneath you.

1020
01:04:57.76 --> 01:04:58.76
Yes, yes.

1021
01:04:58.76 --> 01:04:59.76
And that's what this reminds me of.

1022
01:04:59.76 --> 01:05:02.76
Yeah, I'll add this to your list of things that aren't.

1023
01:05:02.76 --> 01:05:04.76
Controllable.

1024
01:05:04.76 --> 01:05:07.76
All of the existence.

1025
01:05:07.76 --> 01:05:15.76
That's why, like you think of a leaf or a, you know, okay, consider something that's control, like that's why we invent rulers.

1026
01:05:15.76 --> 01:05:17.76
That's why we invent thermometers.

1027
01:05:17.76 --> 01:05:19.76
You know, temperatures so dynamic.

1028
01:05:19.76 --> 01:05:21.76
I can walk right five feet away.

1029
01:05:21.76 --> 01:05:24.76
The temperature when you really come down to the temperatures can be different.

1030
01:05:24.76 --> 01:05:28.76
There's no set controlled anything.

1031
01:05:28.76 --> 01:05:31.76
Everything's still ambiguous and slippery in with everything.

1032
01:05:31.76 --> 01:05:33.76
Everything, everything, all of existence.

1033
01:05:33.76 --> 01:05:38.76
But like how you said, where people try to control, that's kind of, that's in our nature though.

1034
01:05:38.76 --> 01:05:39.76
That's why it isn't.

1035
01:05:39.76 --> 01:05:44.76
With rulers and mile markers and it is and it can drive you crazy.

1036
01:05:44.76 --> 01:05:47.76
And if you try and control the chaos of combat, you're going to get destroyed.

1037
01:05:47.76 --> 01:05:53.76
And if you try and control everything in your life, things that are not controllable, then you're going to destroy it.

1038
01:05:53.76 --> 01:05:57.76
If you try and control the relationship and aspects of relationship that are not controllable.

1039
01:05:57.76 --> 01:05:59.76
You know what you control in the relationship?

1040
01:05:59.76 --> 01:06:00.76
You control you.

1041
01:06:00.76 --> 01:06:03.76
You're self in a real ambiguous way, by the way.

1042
01:06:03.76 --> 01:06:06.76
Because you're always adapting ideally from an ideal standpoint.

1043
01:06:06.76 --> 01:06:07.76
You're always adapting as well.

1044
01:06:07.76 --> 01:06:10.76
So yes, it's kind of like, you know what?

1045
01:06:10.76 --> 01:06:13.76
You try and control the relationship by controlling the other person.

1046
01:06:13.76 --> 01:06:16.76
When reality, you need to control yourself.

1047
01:06:16.76 --> 01:06:16.76
Yeah.

1048
01:06:16.76 --> 01:06:19.76
Because most people don't do that.

1049
01:06:19.76 --> 01:06:25.76
Most people don't exercise the beauty of mind control that they can control your mind.

1050
01:06:25.76 --> 01:06:27.76
You can think what you want to think.

1051
01:06:27.76 --> 01:06:29.76
You can put those thoughts in your head.

1052
01:06:29.76 --> 01:06:31.76
You can eliminate the bad ones.

1053
01:06:31.76 --> 01:06:33.76
You can bring forth the good ones.

1054
01:06:33.76 --> 01:06:34.76
Mm-hmm.

1055
01:06:34.76 --> 01:06:35.76
Mind control.

1056
01:06:35.76 --> 01:06:36.76
Yeah.

1057
01:06:41.76 --> 01:06:43.76
And I almost want to close on that.

1058
01:06:43.76 --> 01:06:45.76
Because that's such a good thing to remember.

1059
01:06:45.76 --> 01:06:46.76
But I will follow up with us.

1060
01:06:46.76 --> 01:06:49.76
It says complex instructions are at best.

1061
01:06:49.76 --> 01:06:54.76
Pre-mature during what is usually an inaccurate assessment of the situation.

1062
01:06:54.76 --> 01:06:58.76
So when you're looking at something, and you're going to, okay, here's the plan.

1063
01:06:58.76 --> 01:06:59.76
Here's what we're going to do.

1064
01:06:59.76 --> 01:07:02.76
At best, that's premature and inaccurate.

1065
01:07:02.76 --> 01:07:03.76
What your plan is.

1066
01:07:03.76 --> 01:07:07.76
So when you're trying to figure out what you're going to do with that business deal,

1067
01:07:07.76 --> 01:07:10.76
and you're trying to create this very detailed plan around it,

1068
01:07:10.76 --> 01:07:12.76
at best it's premature and inaccurate.

1069
01:07:12.76 --> 01:07:13.76
Right.

1070
01:07:16.76 --> 01:07:18.76
At best, it's premature and accurate.

1071
01:07:18.76 --> 01:07:19.76
So don't get locked around.

1072
01:07:19.76 --> 01:07:21.76
You're going to make these plans.

1073
01:07:21.76 --> 01:07:22.76
They're going to be rigid.

1074
01:07:22.76 --> 01:07:25.76
And here's the way we're going to do it at best it's premature and accurate.

1075
01:07:25.76 --> 01:07:30.76
So think about what you can control and what you can't

1076
01:07:30.76 --> 01:07:32.76
and move forward for that.

1077
01:07:32.76 --> 01:07:41.76
A good example of recognizing or a good way to recognize if you're not practicing these types of thoughts

1078
01:07:41.76 --> 01:07:50.76
or ways of looking at things is when you make a plan and the plan and it doesn't go according to plan,

1079
01:07:50.76 --> 01:07:54.76
and you get mad about it, you're going to get red flag.

1080
01:07:54.76 --> 01:07:55.76
That's a red flag right there.

1081
01:07:55.76 --> 01:07:56.76
That is a red flag.

1082
01:07:56.76 --> 01:08:01.76
And when your relationship isn't going the way you wanted to be,

1083
01:08:01.76 --> 01:08:06.76
it's because it should be a news flash that you can't control this other human being.

1084
01:08:06.76 --> 01:08:08.76
You can only control you.

1085
01:08:08.76 --> 01:08:11.76
And this goes back to what we talked about on the last show.

1086
01:08:11.76 --> 01:08:16.76
When we talked about your family and your close friends,

1087
01:08:16.76 --> 01:08:22.76
and we kind of got to the point where I think I was saying,

1088
01:08:22.76 --> 01:08:25.76
hey, you can't worry about them.

1089
01:08:25.76 --> 01:08:31.76
And you said the same thing and I think this is a little bit more clarity on that point is you cannot control them.

1090
01:08:31.76 --> 01:08:35.76
So you need to grab what you can, you know,

1091
01:08:35.76 --> 01:08:43.76
keep it as under control as you can, but you're not going to get the solid control that you think you've been vet you desire.

1092
01:08:43.76 --> 01:08:47.76
It's kind of like if you have this big trash can lid,

1093
01:08:47.76 --> 01:08:50.76
and then you have this blob of like mercury,

1094
01:08:50.76 --> 01:08:52.76
you're trying to keep it in the center,

1095
01:08:52.76 --> 01:08:57.76
but don't try to like squeeze it with your hand or something because it's going to come out of your fingers.

1096
01:08:57.76 --> 01:08:58.76
Yeah.

1097
01:08:58.76 --> 01:09:06.76
And that, what if your co-host of a show comes up with examples like a trash can lid and mercury?

1098
01:09:06.76 --> 01:09:07.76
You can't control that.

1099
01:09:07.76 --> 01:09:11.76
All you can do is listen, not your head and say,

1100
01:09:11.76 --> 01:09:14.76
good point.

1101
01:09:14.76 --> 01:09:16.76
It's more of an analogy, you know,

1102
01:09:16.76 --> 01:09:20.76
it's like this comparison of, you know, using metaphors.

1103
01:09:20.76 --> 01:09:22.76
Check.

1104
01:09:22.76 --> 01:09:29.76
So moving on, moving on to some questions that we've got from Twitter, from Facebook.

1105
01:09:29.76 --> 01:09:30.76
Got some really good questions.

1106
01:09:30.76 --> 01:09:33.76
And as a matter of fact, these are a continuation of questions.

1107
01:09:33.76 --> 01:09:39.76
I didn't even ask this time because we didn't get through many of them from the last time I asked for input.

1108
01:09:39.76 --> 01:09:43.76
So these are a continuation which means I apologize once again.

1109
01:09:43.76 --> 01:09:47.76
I don't have the names collected of who gave these questions.

1110
01:09:47.76 --> 01:09:48.76
So my fault.

1111
01:09:48.76 --> 01:09:51.76
I apologize if you, if we answer your question,

1112
01:09:51.76 --> 01:09:56.76
we appreciate you giving us the question so that we could answer it.

1113
01:09:56.76 --> 01:09:59.76
First one, let's get down to it.

1114
01:09:59.76 --> 01:10:03.76
So in regards to jujitsu,

1115
01:10:03.76 --> 01:10:05.76
this is a kind of a common question,

1116
01:10:05.76 --> 01:10:09.76
but your input, ge or no ge.

1117
01:10:09.76 --> 01:10:11.76
Do you train both?

1118
01:10:11.76 --> 01:10:13.76
It's that job.

1119
01:10:13.76 --> 01:10:16.76
The answer is ge and no ge.

1120
01:10:16.76 --> 01:10:18.76
I definitely train both.

1121
01:10:18.76 --> 01:10:19.76
I like to train both.

1122
01:10:19.76 --> 01:10:23.76
I don't care which one they're both fond of me.

1123
01:10:23.76 --> 01:10:29.76
And just as we've been talking about a lot tonight through the book,

1124
01:10:29.76 --> 01:10:31.76
the last hundred yards,

1125
01:10:31.76 --> 01:10:39.76
I want my training to be different and surprising and be uncontrollable.

1126
01:10:39.76 --> 01:10:41.76
And when you change,

1127
01:10:41.76 --> 01:10:44.76
it definitely affects you when you change from ge.

1128
01:10:44.76 --> 01:10:47.76
And then obviously you take off your ge and you're sliding all over the place.

1129
01:10:47.76 --> 01:10:49.76
You have to be a better grappler to be able to deal with that.

1130
01:10:49.76 --> 01:10:51.76
So I want to be a better grappler.

1131
01:10:51.76 --> 01:10:54.76
So I do that and there's something else that's in between ge and no ge.

1132
01:10:54.76 --> 01:10:56.76
And that's when you put MMA gloves on.

1133
01:10:56.76 --> 01:11:00.76
You put MMA gloves on and it is somewhere in between ge and no ge because you can get really

1134
01:11:00.76 --> 01:11:02.76
legitimate risk control.

1135
01:11:02.76 --> 01:11:06.76
It's hard to sneak in a choke on somebody when they're wearing gloves.

1136
01:11:06.76 --> 01:11:10.76
So there's benefits to them all and I try and do them all.

1137
01:11:10.76 --> 01:11:11.76
Yeah.

1138
01:11:11.76 --> 01:11:13.76
What?

1139
01:11:13.76 --> 01:11:18.76
Do you find any benefit to doing one and or the other?

1140
01:11:18.76 --> 01:11:21.76
You know, like if you train in the ge, there's certain benefits in training with a ge.

1141
01:11:21.76 --> 01:11:24.76
I think if you train with a ge,

1142
01:11:24.76 --> 01:11:28.76
your defense has to be better because there's no friction.

1143
01:11:28.76 --> 01:11:32.76
And so if you're going to escape an arm lock with the ge on,

1144
01:11:32.76 --> 01:11:34.76
you have to do it very well.

1145
01:11:34.76 --> 01:11:38.76
If you're going to escape a knee lock with the ge on,

1146
01:11:38.76 --> 01:11:40.76
there's a lot of friction.

1147
01:11:40.76 --> 01:11:41.76
It's a lot harder to get out.

1148
01:11:41.76 --> 01:11:44.76
So your defense has to be better with no ge.

1149
01:11:44.76 --> 01:11:47.76
Your offense has to be better because there are no handles to grab.

1150
01:11:47.76 --> 01:11:48.76
It's slippery.

1151
01:11:48.76 --> 01:11:51.76
The people can slide out of the exact opposite reasons.

1152
01:11:51.76 --> 01:11:54.76
So you, I think you improve your offense more.

1153
01:11:54.76 --> 01:12:07.76
And I will say this. My game is compatible with both where I don't do a lot of crazy lapel weaving in between your legs and up over your back.

1154
01:12:07.76 --> 01:12:09.76
And then back over your right arm, pin and around your neck.

1155
01:12:09.76 --> 01:12:11.76
I don't do a lot of that.

1156
01:12:11.76 --> 01:12:12.76
I don't disagree with it.

1157
01:12:12.76 --> 01:12:13.76
I think it's fine.

1158
01:12:13.76 --> 01:12:18.76
But I like to most of the moves that I do are compatible with both.

1159
01:12:18.76 --> 01:12:23.76
Or there's very small differences between the way I have the games set up.

1160
01:12:23.76 --> 01:12:25.76
Yeah.

1161
01:12:25.76 --> 01:12:26.76
Yeah.

1162
01:12:26.76 --> 01:12:27.76
Yeah.

1163
01:12:27.76 --> 01:12:31.76
And Dean originally told me that same thing where when you train in the ghee,

1164
01:12:31.76 --> 01:12:36.76
your defense starts to develop a little bit more.

1165
01:12:36.76 --> 01:12:39.76
Because you've got to like arm lock, you're in the arm lock.

1166
01:12:39.76 --> 01:12:42.76
You can't just spas out of an arm lock easy.

1167
01:12:42.76 --> 01:12:46.76
And even more important actually is not just the submission, but a cross side.

1168
01:12:46.76 --> 01:12:47.76
Yeah.

1169
01:12:47.76 --> 01:12:49.76
It's a cross side on you with the ge on.

1170
01:12:49.76 --> 01:12:51.76
They've got those candles and it's very difficult.

1171
01:12:51.76 --> 01:12:54.76
Very difficult.

1172
01:12:54.76 --> 01:12:55.76
Or a cross side control, all that stuff.

1173
01:12:55.76 --> 01:12:57.76
And it's easier to hold them down.

1174
01:12:57.76 --> 01:12:59.76
Yeah.

1175
01:12:59.76 --> 01:13:01.76
So if you train no ghee and you're trying to hold some down.

1176
01:13:01.76 --> 01:13:05.76
No ghee, it actually takes more technique to hold somebody down with no ghee than it does with ghee.

1177
01:13:05.76 --> 01:13:08.76
Even though sometimes I hear people say the ghee is more technical.

1178
01:13:08.76 --> 01:13:09.76
Right.

1179
01:13:09.76 --> 01:13:10.76
I don't actually agree with that.

1180
01:13:10.76 --> 01:13:12.76
I think they're both technical in their own aspect.

1181
01:13:12.76 --> 01:13:13.76
Yeah.

1182
01:13:13.76 --> 01:13:16.76
So and even holding someone down, that's more of an offensive move.

1183
01:13:16.76 --> 01:13:17.76
Right.

1184
01:13:17.76 --> 01:13:22.76
And then you can do that with the ghee.

1185
01:13:22.76 --> 01:13:25.76
You've got to understand the concept in those techniques to get out or whether it be being held down or submission or whatever.

1186
01:13:25.76 --> 01:13:26.76
You have to understand those concepts.

1187
01:13:26.76 --> 01:13:30.76
And when you understand the concepts, then you can be successful.

1188
01:13:30.76 --> 01:13:33.76
As opposed to like a no ghee situation, you don't.

1189
01:13:33.76 --> 01:13:34.76
Ness is serious.

1190
01:13:34.76 --> 01:13:40.76
I mean, you should understand the concept for sure, but you don't necessarily have to because you could just spas out of it or like an arm lock.

1191
01:13:40.76 --> 01:13:41.76
You couldn't.

1192
01:13:41.76 --> 01:13:43.76
If you're sweaty, you could spas out of an arm lock with little technique.

1193
01:13:43.76 --> 01:13:44.76
You know, if you're strong.

1194
01:13:44.76 --> 01:13:47.76
With the ghee, it's going to be way harder to do that.

1195
01:13:47.76 --> 01:13:51.76
So you're kind of in a way learn more and flip flat when you go off and it's the defense.

1196
01:13:51.76 --> 01:13:52.76
It's the same kind of thing.

1197
01:13:52.76 --> 01:13:54.76
With the no ghee, the offensive stuff.

1198
01:13:54.76 --> 01:13:58.76
You've got to understand where you got to control his shoulder.

1199
01:13:58.76 --> 01:14:01.76
Otherwise he's going to, you know, have enough room to slide it out.

1200
01:14:01.76 --> 01:14:05.76
So you have to have that perfect control to execute a good submission if the guy's good.

1201
01:14:05.76 --> 01:14:06.76
So.

1202
01:14:06.76 --> 01:14:09.76
And I think, you know, with life.

1203
01:14:09.76 --> 01:14:14.76
What I do in life is I try and put myself in tough situation.

1204
01:14:14.76 --> 01:14:16.76
So I'm practicing them to own use to them.

1205
01:14:16.76 --> 01:14:22.76
And, you know, that's what that's what the physical aspect of life is.

1206
01:14:22.76 --> 01:14:28.76
You know, to improve, you got to challenge yourself and put yourself in the worst scenarios and go and try and get through them.

1207
01:14:28.76 --> 01:14:37.76
You know, whether that's a weight room with a squat rack or whether that's a run or whether that's a swim or whatever that physical challenge is.

1208
01:14:37.76 --> 01:14:42.76
You want to, you want to make it as difficult as possible or putting yourself out there.

1209
01:14:42.76 --> 01:14:51.76
Or putting yourself out there as I have challenged myself to outside my comfort zone into the world of humans.

1210
01:14:51.76 --> 01:14:52.76
Multimedia.

1211
01:14:52.76 --> 01:14:53.76
Yes.

1212
01:14:53.76 --> 01:15:02.76
They say, well, I've heard that public speaking is the number one fear of people.

1213
01:15:02.76 --> 01:15:03.76
I have heard that as well.

1214
01:15:03.76 --> 01:15:10.76
And I, it's hard for me to like do I have no, I'm not afraid of getting up and talking to a few people.

1215
01:15:10.76 --> 01:15:13.76
Like it doesn't, I don't understand that.

1216
01:15:13.76 --> 01:15:16.76
I don't understand what that must feel like.

1217
01:15:16.76 --> 01:15:17.76
Right.

1218
01:15:17.76 --> 01:15:18.76
You understand why, though.

1219
01:15:18.76 --> 01:15:20.76
It's really hard for me to understand.

1220
01:15:20.76 --> 01:15:21.76
Right.

1221
01:15:21.76 --> 01:15:22.76
Start for you to relate.

1222
01:15:22.76 --> 01:15:23.76
Right.

1223
01:15:23.76 --> 01:15:25.76
Well, because, man, it's.

1224
01:15:25.76 --> 01:15:27.76
Do you get nervous talking in front of people?

1225
01:15:27.76 --> 01:15:28.76
Yeah.

1226
01:15:28.76 --> 01:15:29.76
Yeah.

1227
01:15:29.76 --> 01:15:36.76
I think I'm really no different than the most people in that regard for sure.

1228
01:15:36.76 --> 01:15:39.76
But yeah, there's a reason for that.

1229
01:15:39.76 --> 01:15:47.76
I think it's because it's, it's almost like the subconscious feeling that everyone's judging every little thing that comes out of your mouth.

1230
01:15:47.76 --> 01:15:51.76
Every little thing that you do movement wise, you know.

1231
01:15:51.76 --> 01:15:57.76
So your whole being is being judged by all kinds of different people with all kinds of different standards.

1232
01:15:57.76 --> 01:16:02.76
And when you care about that or when you've paid the price for that, maybe.

1233
01:16:02.76 --> 01:16:05.76
I think because we, you know, when you get raised, I think you pay the price for that.

1234
01:16:05.76 --> 01:16:08.76
If you say the wrong thing, if you do the wrong thing.

1235
01:16:08.76 --> 01:16:09.76
Yeah.

1236
01:16:09.76 --> 01:16:14.76
And I think in a way ridicule the, you know, whatever, whatever you've got, however, that looks for you.

1237
01:16:14.76 --> 01:16:19.76
You've paid the price for growing up or you've got to learn another large scale.

1238
01:16:19.76 --> 01:16:20.76
Yeah.

1239
01:16:20.76 --> 01:16:21.76
And that's exactly what you got.

1240
01:16:21.76 --> 01:16:25.76
You're in a situation where that's all kind of coming into your brain.

1241
01:16:25.76 --> 01:16:30.76
You're coming into your brain where you, you fear that price that you're going to pay.

1242
01:16:30.76 --> 01:16:34.76
And it's times a thousand because there's a thousand people there.

1243
01:16:34.76 --> 01:16:41.76
And I think it's kind of subconscious all your left with consciously is this just anxiety.

1244
01:16:41.76 --> 01:16:44.76
That's how we feel for your mind back up.

1245
01:16:44.76 --> 01:16:48.76
No, you're going to put yourself in those bad situations.

1246
01:16:48.76 --> 01:16:49.76
Yes.

1247
01:16:49.76 --> 01:16:54.76
You know, put your, if you're going to public speak or if you're afraid of public speaking.

1248
01:16:54.76 --> 01:16:58.76
You're just a small thing or, you know, do something yourself in that situation.

1249
01:16:58.76 --> 01:17:14.76
And if you don't want to go from zero to 10, do a small one, you know, do something like with low consequences, you know, or less impactful consequences and just start small and and go up.

1250
01:17:14.76 --> 01:17:18.76
That's probably what you did.

1251
01:17:18.76 --> 01:17:21.76
So next question.

1252
01:17:21.76 --> 01:17:23.76
Next question.

1253
01:17:23.76 --> 01:17:29.76
So, okay, micromanagers, how do you deal with micromanagers?

1254
01:17:29.76 --> 01:17:30.76
Okay.

1255
01:17:30.76 --> 01:17:37.76
So if you worked for me and you were super square away, then I was a great boss and totally left you alone.

1256
01:17:37.76 --> 01:17:44.76
If you worked for me and you were not square away, I was a complete micromanager.

1257
01:17:44.76 --> 01:17:46.76
So that's a little indicator.

1258
01:17:46.76 --> 01:18:07.76
Now, I have worked for micromanagers before everyone does. You run into them in the world. And the way the best way I've figured to get out from under the, the, the, the, the draconian thumb of the micromanager is to try and gain their trust.

1259
01:18:07.76 --> 01:18:12.76
And what you want to do is you want to be ahead of them.

1260
01:18:12.76 --> 01:18:21.76
And I want to actually do something that I when I was on the Tim Ferriss program. I talked about how when I told my dad, I was joining the military and I was this rebellious kind of crazy kid.

1261
01:18:21.76 --> 01:18:23.76
And he said, oh, you're going to hate it because you hate authority.

1262
01:18:23.76 --> 01:18:25.76
And I did it anyways.

1263
01:18:25.76 --> 01:18:33.76
And when I got in, I was like, damn, my dad was right. I do hate authority. I don't like listening to people.

1264
01:18:33.76 --> 01:18:38.76
And now I have to listen to them all the time. And then I realized very quickly when I was in my first seal,

1265
01:18:38.76 --> 01:18:44.76
I didn't want anyone to tell me what to do. And I was in charge of the radio as I was a radio man.

1266
01:18:44.76 --> 01:18:53.76
And what I did, what I did was, you know, if the radio's had to be ready, I knew they had to be ready. I just got them ready. I got them ready ahead of a time.

1267
01:18:53.76 --> 01:18:58.76
I did everything before anyone could tell me to do it. I would come in and work to be ready before anyone could tell me what to do.

1268
01:18:58.76 --> 01:19:03.76
So I basically was completely psychotically proactive.

1269
01:19:03.76 --> 01:19:09.76
And just was ahead of the power curve on every little thing that I could be ahead of the power curve on it.

1270
01:19:09.76 --> 01:19:15.76
And eventually it didn't take long. The people that micro managed me, all of a sudden like, hey, I'm not going to bother with this guy anymore. He's already done it.

1271
01:19:15.76 --> 01:19:17.76
Because every time they say, hey, do you have this, it's already done.

1272
01:19:17.76 --> 01:19:20.76
Hey, did you start preparing that already? Did it in this morning?

1273
01:19:20.76 --> 01:19:23.76
And eventually they say, oh, okay, this guy knows what he's doing.

1274
01:19:23.76 --> 01:19:30.76
And what you're trying to do is build up the trust. Because that's what it is. It's a little, it's a little lack of trust that people have.

1275
01:19:30.76 --> 01:19:34.76
And they're going to go the way. And they've probably learned that somewhere. So don't hold it against them.

1276
01:19:34.76 --> 01:19:52.76
But it's your job to create a relationship with them of trust where they stop micro managing you and move on to somebody else that needs to be micro managed.

1277
01:19:52.76 --> 01:19:55.76
Next.

1278
01:19:55.76 --> 01:20:03.76
So what about family and people who are close to you or they all the same? And if not, how do you deal with it?

1279
01:20:03.76 --> 01:20:12.76
So this is the trials and tribulations of the alpha personality.

1280
01:20:12.76 --> 01:20:17.76
And you're always trying to go hard to go fast and make things happen.

1281
01:20:17.76 --> 01:20:26.76
And how do you deal with this is someone that asking this and whoever you are. Thank you for asking this question.

1282
01:20:26.76 --> 01:20:32.76
People are people like me are the same. And if not, how do I deal with it? Well, first of all, no, there's not too many people like me.

1283
01:20:32.76 --> 01:20:39.76
And as a matter of fact, there's not too many people like you echo and people that are listening this, there's not too many people like you either.

1284
01:20:39.76 --> 01:20:50.76
People are unique. And I'm not trying to make people like me or make them do the things that I do. I'm over that phase.

1285
01:20:50.76 --> 01:20:57.76
You know, I've talked about this before like there was a time where I would try and convince people about things.

1286
01:20:57.76 --> 01:21:04.76
And I don't try and do anymore. I'll discuss them. But I'm not here to win an argument. I'm not that concerned about you.

1287
01:21:04.76 --> 01:21:15.76
I'll again, if you're someone that I'm friends with and I'm trying to help you. I'm concerned, but I'm not trying to change people's minds.

1288
01:21:15.76 --> 01:21:24.76
But it's interesting because what I'm really trying to do is I'm trying to appreciate people's perspectives. I'm trying to learn from other people.

1289
01:21:24.76 --> 01:21:38.76
And I thought this was actually speaking of Twitter. On Twitter the other day, I posted a little paragraph and it's by a guy named Mark Rippato who's a coach.

1290
01:21:38.76 --> 01:21:46.76
She's written, you know, probably one of the best, one of the best books about weightlifting that you can get.

1291
01:21:46.76 --> 01:22:00.76
It's called starting strength, basic barbell training, Mark Rippato. But the opening of it is freaking awesome. And I brought it with me. So I could read it to you.

1292
01:22:00.76 --> 01:22:09.76
So here's this opening to this book about weightlifting.

1293
01:22:09.76 --> 01:22:18.76
Physical strength is the most important thing in life. This is true, whether we want it to be or not.

1294
01:22:18.76 --> 01:22:27.76
As humanity has developed throughout history, physical strength has become less critical to our daily existence, but no less important to our lives.

1295
01:22:27.76 --> 01:22:36.76
Our strength, more than any other thing we possess, still determines the quality and the quantity of our time here in these bodies.

1296
01:22:36.76 --> 01:22:42.76
Whereas previously our physical strength determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed.

1297
01:22:42.76 --> 01:22:51.76
It now merely determines how well we function in these new surroundings we have crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated.

1298
01:22:51.76 --> 01:23:00.76
But we are still animals. Our physical existence is in the final analysis, the only one that actually matters.

1299
01:23:00.76 --> 01:23:13.76
A weak man is not as happy as the same man would be if he were strong. This reality is offensive to some people who would like the intellectual or spiritual to take precedence.

1300
01:23:13.76 --> 01:23:21.76
It is instructed to see what happens to these very people as their squat strength goes up.

1301
01:23:21.76 --> 01:23:34.76
Now that's freaking epic. That is an epic call out to the passion that Coach Rippertill has. That's just awesome.

1302
01:23:34.76 --> 01:23:37.76
So I put that on Twitter, I was fired up, you know.

1303
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:43.76
And because somebody mentioned starting strength and I said, yeah, of course, you know, this is a classic.

1304
01:23:43.76 --> 01:24:01.76
And somebody on Twitter wrote back and it said, I disagree, I will avoid reading things like this.

1305
01:24:01.76 --> 01:24:05.76
And I broke back, again, I'm not trying to argue with anybody.

1306
01:24:05.76 --> 01:24:13.76
I just wrote back, hey, when I don't agree with people on a subject, I don't avoid it. I just try and learn from it.

1307
01:24:13.76 --> 01:24:19.76
And the fact of the matter is, even though I think what Coach wrote is awesome, I actually don't agree with it.

1308
01:24:19.76 --> 01:24:29.76
I don't think that strength is the most important thing in life. I think knowledge is more powerful. I think respect and loyalty and honor and treating people well.

1309
01:24:29.76 --> 01:24:42.76
I think all those things are more important than strength. And there's been people that were incredibly weak in the world that have done amazing things and were powerful leaders and were incredible human beings.

1310
01:24:42.76 --> 01:24:50.76
So I don't actually, you know, believe that strength is literally the most important thing.

1311
01:24:50.76 --> 01:25:00.76
Now that being said, if you are smart, if you are an intellectual, then you realize that you should use that knowledge to be strong, so you can not be physically bullied, so you can be healthy.

1312
01:25:00.76 --> 01:25:10.76
So you can protect yourself, so you can be self-reliant. I mean, there's no doubt that strength is a powerful force, but like I said, there's many other things that I think are more important.

1313
01:25:10.76 --> 01:25:26.76
Now, but what I like about it is that hearing this opinion broadens my mind. It makes me smarter. It makes me understand how important strength is to some people. And maybe that it should be more important in my head.

1314
01:25:26.76 --> 01:25:37.76
Because honestly, when I read that for the first time years ago, I was like, oh, you know what? That's awesome. And I should always keep somewhere in my mind that being strong is important and being strong is good.

1315
01:25:37.76 --> 01:25:43.76
And you know, in this day and age, people actually, I think, believe that being strong is bad.

1316
01:25:43.76 --> 01:26:01.76
As crazy as that might sound. There's nothing wrong with being strong. You know, being strong is good. Never mind, nothing wrong. It's a good thing to be strong. I wish I was stronger. I try and get stronger. And I'm not a naturally strong person. I'm just kind of an average person that works out a lot.

1317
01:26:01.76 --> 01:26:14.76
So my point there is the number number one, when you get people that are different than you, don't try, I don't try and change them. I try and keep an open mind. I try and learn from them.

1318
01:26:14.76 --> 01:26:19.76
I'm trying to talk about this earlier tonight. People have strengths and people have weaknesses.

1319
01:26:19.76 --> 01:26:29.76
And if people have strengths, I'm going to try and learn from their strengths. And some people are, I have more weaknesses. And I try and learn from them as well. You get someone that's an addict.

1320
01:26:29.76 --> 01:26:45.76
You get someone that's a social path. Or you get someone that's a, you know, a real giver or someone that helps. And there's people that one thing that that I don't feel like I help on people enough.

1321
01:26:45.76 --> 01:26:51.76
And so I always look at people that are very helpful. And I say, okay, what can I do? What can I take away from their perspective?

1322
01:26:51.76 --> 01:26:58.76
But you know, if I meet someone that's an addict, I learn from them. They teach me very important lessons.

1323
01:26:58.76 --> 01:27:09.76
People that are winners, people that are losers, I'm going to learn from both of them. Now, back to the original question of, how do you deal with it?

1324
01:27:09.76 --> 01:27:16.76
Because I'm, I'm, I'm inferring from the question that this person that asked it gets frustrated.

1325
01:27:16.76 --> 01:27:27.76
That others are not living up to their expectations. Now, this is going to sound bad when I say this initially.

1326
01:27:27.76 --> 01:27:39.76
Is that I actually have relatively or I shouldn't say I have. I keep relatively low expectations of humans.

1327
01:27:39.76 --> 01:27:45.76
Meaning when I meet someone, I don't expect to get a lot out of them.

1328
01:27:45.76 --> 01:27:52.76
I expect to be let down. I expect people, as I talked about the other day, people are crazy.

1329
01:27:52.76 --> 01:28:01.76
And I expect that. I expect people to do irrational things. So that's kind of my baseline.

1330
01:28:01.76 --> 01:28:09.76
And then what's beautiful about it is I'm surprised and happy and in,

1331
01:28:09.76 --> 01:28:22.76
I'm surprised when people are supportive, when people are reliable, when people are good people, when they make sense, when they're not crazy.

1332
01:28:22.76 --> 01:28:29.76
And so I think setting the right level of expectations is important to keep yourself from going crazy, trying to change people.

1333
01:28:29.76 --> 01:28:43.76
And the other thing I like about this attitude is, I'm not sitting there blaming other people around me. I'm not blaming whether it's my family, whether it's my team, whether it's my people I work with.

1334
01:28:43.76 --> 01:28:52.76
I'm not blaming them for being unmotivated or blaming them for not trying harder, blaming them for whatever. I'm just taking responsibility for what's happening.

1335
01:28:52.76 --> 01:29:00.76
In my, for me, I'm taking responsibility if they're not motivated, I need to try and motivate me if I get a bottom.

1336
01:29:00.76 --> 01:29:06.76
If they're dragging me down, who's fault is that? That's not there fault. I'm letting them drag me down.

1337
01:29:06.76 --> 01:29:15.76
So I'm taking responsibility of my interactions with people to make sure I move it in the right direction. And as a leader, it's my job to get the most out of people.

1338
01:29:15.76 --> 01:29:22.76
I mean, I always talked about that. You're going to have your whole team is not going to be studs. You're going to have people on your team that are weak.

1339
01:29:22.76 --> 01:29:29.76
And it's your job to get what you can out of that person. Take advantage of whatever strengths they might have.

1340
01:29:29.76 --> 01:29:33.76
Cover further weaknesses where you can.

1341
01:29:33.76 --> 01:29:41.76
That's what you're doing as a leader and you're leading, whether that's leading in business or your team or your group of friends or whatever.

1342
01:29:41.76 --> 01:29:47.76
You're taking a leadership position and you're getting what you can out of people.

1343
01:29:47.76 --> 01:29:53.76
And that's how I deal with people that are close to me that are not the same as me.

1344
01:29:53.76 --> 01:29:58.76
Don't want to hang around with a bunch of people off. I don't mind hanging around.

1345
01:29:58.76 --> 01:30:00.76
People that are like me.

1346
01:30:00.76 --> 01:30:13.76
Feel teams is pretty. The seal teams as a lot of people with a similar, you know, they're like, got some similar personalities in there, which is always fun.

1347
01:30:13.76 --> 01:30:18.76
Are there? So you see a low expectations is there.

1348
01:30:18.76 --> 01:30:21.76
Isn't that sound bad? I apologize to people of the world right now.

1349
01:30:21.76 --> 01:30:22.76
Yeah.

1350
01:30:22.76 --> 01:30:24.76
That when I look at you, I have low expectations.

1351
01:30:24.76 --> 01:30:26.76
Don't think of it that way.

1352
01:30:26.76 --> 01:30:30.76
I'm saying in my own mind, I'm just setting low expectations.

1353
01:30:30.76 --> 01:30:32.76
Yeah, because you just don't expect a lot.

1354
01:30:32.76 --> 01:30:35.76
You know, yes, that's like like you don't expect.

1355
01:30:35.76 --> 01:30:38.76
Shitting us, you expect. You just don't expect.

1356
01:30:38.76 --> 01:30:39.76
I just lot.

1357
01:30:39.76 --> 01:30:40.76
Yes.

1358
01:30:40.76 --> 01:30:41.76
Yeah.

1359
01:30:41.76 --> 01:30:48.76
So someone's making this, you know, tall claim, you don't expect that claim to be fulfilled 100% or, you know, or whatever.

1360
01:30:48.76 --> 01:30:55.76
I set low expectations and I look to be pleasantly surprised by those people in the world that people that are listening to this podcast.

1361
01:30:55.76 --> 01:30:58.76
You all out there. You're going to fire me up.

1362
01:30:58.76 --> 01:31:06.76
You know, but really, that's, you know, most people that you meet, you can't rely on.

1363
01:31:06.76 --> 01:31:07.76
Right.

1364
01:31:07.76 --> 01:31:12.76
And that's why it's important to find people that are like minded and link arms with them and go forward into the fray.

1365
01:31:12.76 --> 01:31:13.76
Yeah.

1366
01:31:13.76 --> 01:31:17.76
And it's not like people are unreliable, specifically.

1367
01:31:17.76 --> 01:31:23.76
It's just that if you set your own specific expectations on people, because I was different, you're different.

1368
01:31:23.76 --> 01:31:33.76
Like, how are you saying? So if you set your specific expectations, which I think most of us do that in one way or another, we expect certain things.

1369
01:31:33.76 --> 01:31:39.76
All the way down to the language we use, some people, you know, some people don't like if they are called boss.

1370
01:31:39.76 --> 01:31:45.76
You know, you're like, hey boss, it's a boss. Something, I don't really like that when someone calls me boss.

1371
01:31:45.76 --> 01:31:48.76
You know, if you don't know your name, you know, hey bro, the same thing boss.

1372
01:31:48.76 --> 01:31:52.76
But they meant it in a good way, you know, but I expect, yeah, I expect you never to use that word.

1373
01:31:52.76 --> 01:31:56.76
When you address me kind of thing, I mean it's not that serious.

1374
01:31:56.76 --> 01:32:00.76
But anyway, that's just a small example.

1375
01:32:00.76 --> 01:32:10.76
So if you start setting your own expectations, your specific own expectations consciously and subconsciously, yeah, you, you'll get that down.

1376
01:32:10.76 --> 01:32:11.76
I don't know what that's what I was supposed to say.

1377
01:32:11.76 --> 01:32:12.76
It's your fault.

1378
01:32:12.76 --> 01:32:20.76
And you know what's a good, it's good time to this is, and I run it as with business leaders, where they know their superover,

1379
01:32:20.76 --> 01:32:26.76
achievers and they expect that level of performance out of everyone and they're not going to get it. And the way I explained it to them, I say, listen,

1380
01:32:26.76 --> 01:32:35.76
I understand what you want to have happened. But just because as a leader, the lead the Paltoon commander is able to carry a hundred pound rucksack,

1381
01:32:35.76 --> 01:32:41.76
10 kilometers into the target, hit the target and walk about out another 10 kilometers.

1382
01:32:41.76 --> 01:32:46.76
Doesn't mean that everybody else in the Paltoon can do it. And therefore he cannot plan that mission.

1383
01:32:46.76 --> 01:33:02.76
Right. And I will usually get food them on that because they do realize that they're high performers and that they're overachievers and that they're not going to get so how are you going to set the expectations so that you're, you've got people that can actually achieve the expectations you've said for them.

1384
01:33:02.76 --> 01:33:04.76
So that's right on point.

1385
01:33:04.76 --> 01:33:05.76
Yes.

1386
01:33:08.76 --> 01:33:12.76
Yes, I did get men set those look kind of low expectations.

1387
01:33:12.76 --> 01:33:21.76
I know that sounds better than be that, but let them be them. Yeah. And that way, when you get let if you get let down.

1388
01:33:21.76 --> 01:33:28.76
Actually, you probably have a less chance of getting let down. So it's essentially you're minimizing the downside.

1389
01:33:28.76 --> 01:33:29.76
Maximizing the upside.

1390
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:31.76
That's a positive way.

1391
01:33:31.76 --> 01:33:38.76
That's a positive way, but yes, you're correct. Thank you for making me give me a positive spin to my negative attitude.

1392
01:33:38.76 --> 01:33:42.76
I think I understand what you mean. I think so.

1393
01:33:42.76 --> 01:33:56.76
Part of it is denial, by the way, because I don't want to ever admit or think that you had some low expectations of me in my functionality.

1394
01:33:56.76 --> 01:33:58.76
Okay, we'll go next question.

1395
01:33:58.76 --> 01:34:02.76
Okay, what are the top three?

1396
01:34:02.76 --> 01:34:06.76
The top three to ten business problems you're asked to solve.

1397
01:34:06.76 --> 01:34:12.76
Good question. Interesting question. Because why would you say top three to ten?

1398
01:34:12.76 --> 01:34:14.76
Who wrote that? That's crazy.

1399
01:34:14.76 --> 01:34:17.76
You know, you say three or four or three to five, maybe.

1400
01:34:17.76 --> 01:34:18.76
But three to ten?

1401
01:34:18.76 --> 01:34:20.76
No, no, this is actually, I mean, top three.

1402
01:34:20.76 --> 01:34:21.76
Well, we'll go for it.

1403
01:34:21.76 --> 01:34:23.76
That being said, here's the problem.

1404
01:34:23.76 --> 01:34:28.76
Here's the problem that we come up against in Lafayne, I deal with on a regular basis.

1405
01:34:28.76 --> 01:34:35.76
Is we get called in due to either a lack of execution or desire to improve execution.

1406
01:34:35.76 --> 01:34:38.76
And this is the same thing we dealt with with working with leadership and the seal teams.

1407
01:34:38.76 --> 01:34:42.76
You get teams that are not executing correctly.

1408
01:34:42.76 --> 01:34:45.76
That's the problem that we come into solve.

1409
01:34:45.76 --> 01:34:50.76
Now, that execution could be production, that execution could be sales, that execution could be manufacturing.

1410
01:34:50.76 --> 01:34:52.76
It could be anything.

1411
01:34:52.76 --> 01:34:55.76
That execution.

1412
01:34:55.76 --> 01:35:00.76
So that's what we always get asked to solve.

1413
01:35:00.76 --> 01:35:05.76
That being said, why is there a problem execution?

1414
01:35:05.76 --> 01:35:12.76
And the problems, these are where you get like the, okay, five to seven kind of common problems that we deal with.

1415
01:35:12.76 --> 01:35:15.76
We address, we address most of them.

1416
01:35:15.76 --> 01:35:18.76
In fact, we address all the major ones in the book.

1417
01:35:18.76 --> 01:35:23.76
There's a few nuanced ones, but, you know, the generally the issues are like,

1418
01:35:23.76 --> 01:35:25.76
Oh, you can't get people to buy in.

1419
01:35:25.76 --> 01:35:26.76
We always hear that.

1420
01:35:26.76 --> 01:35:28.76
Our folks aren't buying in.

1421
01:35:28.76 --> 01:35:32.76
They need to plan the philosophy and strategy, whatever.

1422
01:35:32.76 --> 01:35:35.76
People don't understand what's happening.

1423
01:35:35.76 --> 01:35:37.76
They don't understand the vision.

1424
01:35:37.76 --> 01:35:42.76
And we go back and we say, okay, do they understand the why are they, is, how is the vision being communicated?

1425
01:35:42.76 --> 01:35:45.76
How is the vision being translated up and down the chain of command?

1426
01:35:45.76 --> 01:35:53.76
Because you go down from the CEO who has a vision and the way he would speak to that vision is a lot different.

1427
01:35:53.76 --> 01:36:00.76
Then the way a front line, you know, equipment operator is going to want to understand that vision.

1428
01:36:00.76 --> 01:36:06.76
So, is the strategy simple and understandable through the chain of command?

1429
01:36:06.76 --> 01:36:09.76
That can cause a lack of execution, hard or silos.

1430
01:36:09.76 --> 01:36:16.76
Are there different elements within the company that are not helping each other and supporting each other with a good, cover and move?

1431
01:36:16.76 --> 01:36:18.76
Is there a micro management going on?

1432
01:36:18.76 --> 01:36:19.76
We are talking about micro management.

1433
01:36:19.76 --> 01:36:23.76
What micro management can cause legitimate problems of execution?

1434
01:36:23.76 --> 01:36:26.76
Is there unclear guidance?

1435
01:36:26.76 --> 01:36:27.76
That can cause problems.

1436
01:36:27.76 --> 01:36:28.76
Is there ego interfering?

1437
01:36:28.76 --> 01:36:29.76
That can cause problem?

1438
01:36:29.76 --> 01:36:31.76
Is there ego driving process?

1439
01:36:31.76 --> 01:36:37.76
Instead of the best methodology driving process, sometimes it's ego driving process.

1440
01:36:37.76 --> 01:36:41.76
So, it's all these, and there's just these problems.

1441
01:36:41.76 --> 01:36:44.76
And there, we've seen them all.

1442
01:36:44.76 --> 01:36:47.76
I don't think I've seen a new problem yet.

1443
01:36:47.76 --> 01:36:49.76
I've never seen that in quite some time.

1444
01:36:49.76 --> 01:36:51.76
I've never seen this before.

1445
01:36:51.76 --> 01:36:55.76
And there are always these problems of execution.

1446
01:36:55.76 --> 01:36:59.76
Our leadership problems, and we've seen the same thing in some way in the sealed teams.

1447
01:36:59.76 --> 01:37:06.76
So, I think that's why we've been successful as a company going in and getting people to execute better.

1448
01:37:06.76 --> 01:37:09.76
Because we've seen it, we know how to fix it.

1449
01:37:09.76 --> 01:37:11.76
And that's what we do.

1450
01:37:11.76 --> 01:37:12.76
All right.

1451
01:37:12.76 --> 01:37:14.76
Next question is,

1452
01:37:14.76 --> 01:37:19.76
How do you handle a boss that doesn't know as much as you?

1453
01:37:19.76 --> 01:37:22.76
And they don't understand what you do.

1454
01:37:22.76 --> 01:37:24.76
But they're bossy.

1455
01:37:24.76 --> 01:37:26.76
But they bossy.

1456
01:37:26.76 --> 01:37:27.76
Okay.

1457
01:37:27.76 --> 01:37:30.76
So, this is actually a normal situation.

1458
01:37:30.76 --> 01:37:32.76
This is not abnormal.

1459
01:37:32.76 --> 01:37:37.76
Bosses often don't know as much as the front line troops.

1460
01:37:37.76 --> 01:37:39.76
I can tell you right now.

1461
01:37:39.76 --> 01:37:45.76
I was the boss of 35 or 40 seals when I was a tasking commander.

1462
01:37:45.76 --> 01:37:50.76
And I didn't know as much as they knew about their jobs.

1463
01:37:50.76 --> 01:37:53.76
I didn't know what the snipers knew about sniping.

1464
01:37:53.76 --> 01:37:56.76
I didn't know everything that the radio meant about new about the radios.

1465
01:37:56.76 --> 01:37:58.76
I didn't know like,

1466
01:37:58.76 --> 01:38:00.76
Lave was working with the Iraqis.

1467
01:38:00.76 --> 01:38:03.76
I didn't know about his Iraqi soldiers and what they were like.

1468
01:38:03.76 --> 01:38:07.76
I couldn't pretend to know that stuff.

1469
01:38:07.76 --> 01:38:10.76
But I was actually secure in that fact.

1470
01:38:10.76 --> 01:38:12.76
I was okay with that.

1471
01:38:12.76 --> 01:38:16.76
And that's what I recognized that that wasn't my job.

1472
01:38:16.76 --> 01:38:18.76
And I was okay with it.

1473
01:38:18.76 --> 01:38:19.76
So, the question is,

1474
01:38:19.76 --> 01:38:21.76
How do you deal with someone like that?

1475
01:38:21.76 --> 01:38:27.76
Well, let's first recognize the fact that they are insecure in their job.

1476
01:38:27.76 --> 01:38:31.76
So, the reason I was able to let my guys run stuff,

1477
01:38:31.76 --> 01:38:35.76
is because I was secure with myself as a leader and my position.

1478
01:38:35.76 --> 01:38:39.76
When you're dealing with someone that's still bossy,

1479
01:38:39.76 --> 01:38:45.76
they're trying to impose upon you how to do things.

1480
01:38:45.76 --> 01:38:51.76
And that is because the root of that is likely.

1481
01:38:51.76 --> 01:38:53.76
I don't want to call it out as a 100%.

1482
01:38:53.76 --> 01:38:56.76
But the root of that is likely in the security.

1483
01:38:56.76 --> 01:39:00.76
He is insecure about his authority and secured about his leadership.

1484
01:39:00.76 --> 01:39:03.76
Insecure about his position.

1485
01:39:03.76 --> 01:39:07.76
So, when you want to deal with it,

1486
01:39:07.76 --> 01:39:09.76
how do you deal with it?

1487
01:39:09.76 --> 01:39:17.76
Your job becomes in this situation to make your boss feel secure in their position.

1488
01:39:17.76 --> 01:39:19.76
That's what your goal becomes.

1489
01:39:19.76 --> 01:39:22.76
That means, and yes, you know what that means?

1490
01:39:22.76 --> 01:39:24.76
It means not in your head.

1491
01:39:24.76 --> 01:39:28.76
And giving them credit where they might not deserve it.

1492
01:39:28.76 --> 01:39:35.76
And infleading their ego, not infleading, but massaging their ego a little bit.

1493
01:39:35.76 --> 01:39:37.76
And you know what that means?

1494
01:39:37.76 --> 01:39:40.76
The hardest part of that isn't massaging their ego.

1495
01:39:40.76 --> 01:39:42.76
The hardest part of his checking your own ego.

1496
01:39:42.76 --> 01:39:44.76
The hardest part of that is saying is,

1497
01:39:44.76 --> 01:39:48.76
you want to prove to them that you know more than they do.

1498
01:39:48.76 --> 01:39:51.76
And that just bubbles up and over.

1499
01:39:51.76 --> 01:39:53.76
And it will ruin your relationship.

1500
01:39:53.76 --> 01:39:55.76
And it will ruin the job that you're trying to do,

1501
01:39:55.76 --> 01:39:59.76
and you will make them feel secure.

1502
01:39:59.76 --> 01:40:01.76
Because you're like, hey boss, actually you're wrong.

1503
01:40:01.76 --> 01:40:03.76
It's this.

1504
01:40:03.76 --> 01:40:05.76
Well, your ego feels good, but guess what?

1505
01:40:05.76 --> 01:40:06.76
You just hurt his ego.

1506
01:40:06.76 --> 01:40:07.76
Now is what they're going to do.

1507
01:40:07.76 --> 01:40:09.76
They're going to try and pose more.

1508
01:40:09.76 --> 01:40:10.76
We'll up on you.

1509
01:40:10.76 --> 01:40:12.76
So you've actually gone backwards.

1510
01:40:12.76 --> 01:40:13.76
You win the battle.

1511
01:40:13.76 --> 01:40:15.76
You lose the war.

1512
01:40:15.76 --> 01:40:19.76
So, what you need to do is make that boss feel secure.

1513
01:40:19.76 --> 01:40:21.76
Massage their ego.

1514
01:40:21.76 --> 01:40:24.76
Don't try and prove that you know more.

1515
01:40:24.76 --> 01:40:28.76
And in a long run, that will be the beneficial way

1516
01:40:28.76 --> 01:40:30.76
to improve that relationship.

1517
01:40:30.76 --> 01:40:34.76
Let them recognize or let them feel secure with what they're at.

1518
01:40:34.76 --> 01:40:35.76
Where they're at.

1519
01:40:35.76 --> 01:40:39.76
And then they won't impose trying to impose their will on you as the boss man.

1520
01:40:39.76 --> 01:40:41.76
Yeah, that.

1521
01:40:41.76 --> 01:40:43.76
I'm going to add.

1522
01:40:43.76 --> 01:40:47.76
What you kind of what you're saying, I think last time.

1523
01:40:47.76 --> 01:40:50.76
It's a small tiny side note, but I think it's really important.

1524
01:40:50.76 --> 01:40:53.76
When you're doing that, when you're convincing or making them feel more secure.

1525
01:40:53.76 --> 01:40:58.76
As a boss, be sure to come off genuine and consistent.

1526
01:40:58.76 --> 01:41:00.76
Remember how we were talking about that?

1527
01:41:00.76 --> 01:41:01.76
Yeah.

1528
01:41:01.76 --> 01:41:03.76
Because a lot of people will be like, okay, that's what I'm going to do.

1529
01:41:03.76 --> 01:41:06.76
And then they overtly want to show that that's what they're doing.

1530
01:41:06.76 --> 01:41:11.76
Yeah, be the other people because maybe they got scolded or whatever in front of other people.

1531
01:41:11.76 --> 01:41:13.76
And then so they overtly do it.

1532
01:41:13.76 --> 01:41:14.76
And it doesn't come off as genuine.

1533
01:41:14.76 --> 01:41:15.76
Then it's kind of productive.

1534
01:41:15.76 --> 01:41:16.76
You know?

1535
01:41:16.76 --> 01:41:18.76
Yes, this is called what this is what I used to call this.

1536
01:41:18.76 --> 01:41:20.76
It's classic over correction.

1537
01:41:20.76 --> 01:41:24.76
And classical over correction, you know, we'd see guys go too far in one direction.

1538
01:41:24.76 --> 01:41:26.76
Because we're always talking about the dichotomy of leadership.

1539
01:41:26.76 --> 01:41:32.76
And I'd say to a guy, oh, you're doing, you're doing too much.

1540
01:41:32.76 --> 01:41:35.76
You're not doing enough decentralized command and they do classical over correction.

1541
01:41:35.76 --> 01:41:40.76
They would lose control of everything or they if we told them everyone was too wild.

1542
01:41:40.76 --> 01:41:41.76
They didn't have control of anything.

1543
01:41:41.76 --> 01:41:46.76
They'd go in a level nine micro management, you know, and just lock everyone down.

1544
01:41:46.76 --> 01:41:53.76
So yeah, you don't want to do a classical over correction. You want to you want to moderate and modulate your efforts to make the person feel secure.

1545
01:41:53.76 --> 01:41:54.76
No doubt about it.

1546
01:41:54.76 --> 01:42:02.76
Can you apply extreme ownership at mid level management versus the C suite level?

1547
01:42:02.76 --> 01:42:07.76
Well, this is this is absolutely true.

1548
01:42:07.76 --> 01:42:13.76
Can you apply extreme ownership or the the leadership principles that we talk about and extreme ownership?

1549
01:42:13.76 --> 01:42:20.76
Can you apply them at mid level management versus the executive level of the C suite folks?

1550
01:42:20.76 --> 01:42:22.76
And the answer is absolutely yes.

1551
01:42:22.76 --> 01:42:26.76
And not only that, but extreme ownership applies through the entire chain of command.

1552
01:42:26.76 --> 01:42:31.76
The principles are meant for everyone inside the chain of command.

1553
01:42:31.76 --> 01:42:38.76
Because as we talk about all the time, the leadership just doesn't mean the actual designated leaders.

1554
01:42:38.76 --> 01:42:46.76
Every person on a team needs to be a leader. And while that may sound cliche, it is actually true.

1555
01:42:46.76 --> 01:42:50.76
So,

1556
01:42:50.76 --> 01:42:57.76
Not only that, but the senior executives at a company, the CEO, they work for somebody.

1557
01:42:57.76 --> 01:43:02.76
Whether they work for a board, whether it's, you know, Steve Jobs and charge of Apple, guess what?

1558
01:43:02.76 --> 01:43:04.76
He's reporting to shareholders.

1559
01:43:04.76 --> 01:43:12.76
So, everyone has some kind of boss. Everyone's working for somebody and everybody needs to use these principles all the way up and down the chain of command.

1560
01:43:12.76 --> 01:43:19.76
The principles of leadership don't change no matter where you are in the chain of command or what situation you're in.

1561
01:43:19.76 --> 01:43:29.76
And that's why, you know, we're getting, we get called in to help every level of the chain of command from the front line troops from literally from the front line troops, the equipment operators,

1562
01:43:29.76 --> 01:43:37.76
the operators in the field, the salespeople on the front lines, we work with them all the way up to the C-suite and above.

1563
01:43:37.76 --> 01:43:43.76
Yeah, just like how you're saying that it applies to everybody and in every situation, it's absolutely true.

1564
01:43:43.76 --> 01:43:53.76
Like in life, in a relationship with your husband or wife and in the relationship with your kids, same exact thing.

1565
01:43:53.76 --> 01:43:59.76
Yeah. Like if you're taking responsibility for everything you did wrong and right, right?

1566
01:43:59.76 --> 01:44:09.76
I would imagine you take responsibility for the right things you did, but if you're taking responsibility, I think that's when you can eventually function the way that you hope that you'll be able to function.

1567
01:44:09.76 --> 01:44:16.76
You are correct just to be clear, though, when you do do something right and you aren't a leadership position, you actually don't take responsibility for it.

1568
01:44:16.76 --> 01:44:24.76
You push that, you push that praise of accomplishment to the team. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1569
01:44:24.76 --> 01:44:26.76
You never want to absorb that.

1570
01:44:26.76 --> 01:44:28.76
Dang, that's advanced, bro.

1571
01:44:28.76 --> 01:44:32.76
That's actually white belt material.

1572
01:44:32.76 --> 01:44:44.76
Last question, I think. How do you deal with setbacks, failures, delays, defeat, or other disasters?

1573
01:44:44.76 --> 01:44:51.76
How do you ideal with setbacks, failures, delays, defeat, or other disasters?

1574
01:44:51.76 --> 01:45:02.76
I actually have a fairly simple way of dealing with these situations.

1575
01:45:02.76 --> 01:45:08.76
And it's actually one word to deal with all those situations.

1576
01:45:08.76 --> 01:45:11.76
And that is good.

1577
01:45:11.76 --> 01:45:18.76
And this is actually something that one of my direct support, and it's one of my guys that worked for me pointed out to me.

1578
01:45:18.76 --> 01:45:25.76
And he would call me up or pull me aside with some major problems, some issue that was going on.

1579
01:45:25.76 --> 01:45:31.76
And he'd say, oh, so we got this and that and the other thing. And I look at him and I'd say, good.

1580
01:45:31.76 --> 01:45:36.76
And finally one day he was telling me about some issue that he was having some problem.

1581
01:45:36.76 --> 01:45:44.76
He said, I already know what you're going to say. And I said, well, what am I going to say? He said, you're going to say good.

1582
01:45:44.76 --> 01:45:46.76
He said, that's what you always say.

1583
01:45:46.76 --> 01:45:52.76
When something is wrong and going bad, you always just look at me and say good.

1584
01:45:52.76 --> 01:45:56.76
And I said, well, yeah. And I mean it.

1585
01:45:56.76 --> 01:46:04.76
And that is how I feel when things are going bad, there is going to be some good.

1586
01:46:04.76 --> 01:46:08.76
That's going to come from it. And oh, mission got canceled.

1587
01:46:08.76 --> 01:46:11.76
Good. We can focus on another one.

1588
01:46:11.76 --> 01:46:17.76
Didn't get the new high speed gear we wanted. Good. We can keep it simple.

1589
01:46:17.76 --> 01:46:20.76
Didn't get promoted.

1590
01:46:20.76 --> 01:46:24.76
Good. More time to get better.

1591
01:46:24.76 --> 01:46:28.76
Didn't get funded. Good.

1592
01:46:28.76 --> 01:46:31.76
We own more of the company. Didn't get the job you wanted.

1593
01:46:31.76 --> 01:46:36.76
Good. You can get more experience and build a better resume.

1594
01:46:36.76 --> 01:46:39.76
Got injured. Got injured.

1595
01:46:39.76 --> 01:46:41.76
Spray my ankle. Good.

1596
01:46:41.76 --> 01:46:45.76
I needed a break from training.

1597
01:46:45.76 --> 01:46:47.76
Got tapped out. Good.

1598
01:46:47.76 --> 01:46:51.76
It's better to tap and training than to tap out on the street.

1599
01:46:51.76 --> 01:46:57.76
Got beat. Good. You learned.

1600
01:46:57.76 --> 01:47:01.76
Unexpected problems. Good.

1601
01:47:01.76 --> 01:47:05.76
We have the opportunity to figure out a solution.

1602
01:47:05.76 --> 01:47:09.76
That's it. That's it.

1603
01:47:09.76 --> 01:47:16.76
When things are going bad, don't get all bummed out. Don't get startled. Don't get frustrated.

1604
01:47:16.76 --> 01:47:23.76
No. You just look at the issue and you say good.

1605
01:47:23.76 --> 01:47:27.76
I don't mean to say something that's all cliché.

1606
01:47:27.76 --> 01:47:29.76
I don't mean to sound like Mr. Positive.

1607
01:47:29.76 --> 01:47:31.76
Find the positive but do that.

1608
01:47:31.76 --> 01:47:35.76
Focus on the good.

1609
01:47:35.76 --> 01:47:37.76
Take that issue. Take that problem.

1610
01:47:37.76 --> 01:47:39.76
And make it something good.

1611
01:47:39.76 --> 01:47:43.76
It'll bring that attitude to your team too.

1612
01:47:43.76 --> 01:47:45.76
You go forward.

1613
01:47:45.76 --> 01:47:51.76
And lastly, like to close this out.

1614
01:47:51.76 --> 01:47:57.76
If you can say the word good,

1615
01:47:57.76 --> 01:47:59.76
guess what?

1616
01:47:59.76 --> 01:48:01.76
It means you're still alive.

1617
01:48:01.76 --> 01:48:03.76
It means you're still breathing.

1618
01:48:03.76 --> 01:48:07.76
And if you're still breathing?

1619
01:48:07.76 --> 01:48:11.76
Well, then now you still got some fight left in you.

1620
01:48:11.76 --> 01:48:13.76
So get up,

1621
01:48:13.76 --> 01:48:15.76
dust off,

1622
01:48:15.76 --> 01:48:17.76
reload,

1623
01:48:17.76 --> 01:48:23.76
recalibrate,

1624
01:48:23.76 --> 01:48:27.76
and go out on the attack.

1625
01:48:27.76 --> 01:48:35.76
And that right there is about as good as it gets.

1626
01:48:35.76 --> 01:48:37.76
And that's all I got for today.

1627
01:48:37.76 --> 01:48:41.76
So everyone that's been listening.

1628
01:48:41.76 --> 01:48:43.76
Thank you for your patience. Thanks for listening.

1629
01:48:43.76 --> 01:48:45.76
Thanks for spreading the word.

1630
01:48:45.76 --> 01:48:47.76
And most of all,

1631
01:48:47.76 --> 01:48:51.76
to everyone listening to the Jocco podcast.

1632
01:48:51.76 --> 01:49:19.76
Thank you for getting after it.
