This is Jockel Podcast number 37.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick, good evening echo.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And with us tonight, I am honored to have retired chief warn officer Roger Hayden here with us tonight as a guest.

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now unless you are in the seal teams or you were in the seal teams, then you likely don't know who Roger Hayden is.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In fact, I'm going to go ahead and guarantee you don't know who Roger Hayden is.

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There's no book, there's no movie, there's no social media, there's no one to google.

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And I've talked before about how there's three types of guys in the seal teams.

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The guys that built the reputation that the seal team has, the guys that maintain the reputation of the seal teams.

11
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And then there's the guys that live off the reputation of the seal teams.

12
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Usually those guys didn't contribute much to it in the first place.

13
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But let there be no doubt Roger Hayden is without question, without question.

14
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
One of the people, one of the men responsible for building the reputation of the seal teams.

15
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.000
He did the massive heavy lifting and laid down the foundation of everything that the seal teams are in the jungles of Vietnam.

16
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And he passed on lessons of combat written and blood that we carry to this day.

17
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
One of the guys here, Roger Hayden that truly forged the attitude that makes the seal teams what the seal teams are.

18
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And I'm going to tell you quickly how I first heard of Roger.

19
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So I was back, I was a new guy at seal team one. So it's 1991.

20
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And back then no one really seals weren't that popular yet.

21
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And the old seal, UDT seal reunions were not that big of a deal.

22
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There, there were just kind of a small little gig down it, down it like the Lions Club or something in national city, real low key.

23
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But the only guys, none of the younger seals went to him who's all Vietnam seals, maybe a couple world war, two guys.

24
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I was down there with my run and mate at the time, my good friend who's at seal team one who I've gone through buzz with guy by the name of Chris.

25
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And we were just sitting around talking to some old Vietnam guys and we were getting pretty fired up.

26
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You know what's kind of, there's, you don't want you pay the $10 feet to get into this gig.

27
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
There's free beer. So we were a few beers deep. You might say we're listening to stories.

28
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And again, we were new guys. This is 1991. We didn't never been in combat. So we were there to try and learn and about the history and learn about the guys and finally me being young and dumb and pretty well buzzed.

29
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I asked these two Vietnam guys that we were sitting there talking to.

30
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I said, hey, who was the most badass murder in mother fucker and seal and Vietnam?

31
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And both these guys looked at me and said Roger, hey.

32
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And I remember that name. And when I actually met you for the first time, you were, I'd met you a couple times.

33
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But then when I actually worked with you for the first time, you were a lane grader on a patoon, full mission profile.

34
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And that's actually the first time I learned truly understood the concept of cover move, which is a basic tactic, which guys didn't know.

35
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
No one had taught it to me. This was my second patoon. I'd already been through a workup.

36
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I had the idea in my head, but here in you say it the way you described it, I said it, be clicked in my head and never forgot it.

37
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And I actually wrote about it in the book, extreme ownership. And that's what I taught all the seals that when I was putting through training, that's what I taught them.

38
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:35.000
One of those fundamental tactics. And so that's kind of my introduction to Roger Hayden.

39
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So Roger, I know you've actually literally never done an interview before.

40
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And I want to thank you for coming on. It's a true honor to have you on the podcast. So welcome.

41
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Yeah, Roger Hayden here. Thanks, Jack. I really appreciate it. And you're one of my heroes who different environment different times did you kick ass and tuck names to.

42
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I wasn't, I was just one of the boys in the, in CLT-1 when I got there and deployed a couple of times with them.

43
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And our environment was the jungle and we got pretty good at it. And when I went out and hunted the bad guys, nobody else in Vietnam as far as I know army Marines.

44
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Or any of them would go out at night. They would usually hold up at a base camp or somewhere like that while we figured nighttime's when they move around.

45
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That's when we're going to move around. Simply can find these guys and take them out. That's what we did.

46
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It isn't one guy. It's a team effort. Everybody works hard. I had some great great buddies in mine that were, I mean, my gun partner was a stoner guy. And I was a 60 guy between the two of us.

47
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
He shot a thousand runs a minute and nine of five five. I mean, a 716 my 60 at work out well.

48
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Last but two night was in we carried four 60s and five stoners. And if you get in carry a stoner or a 60, you carry that 16 with a 203 on it or XNM 140 for back committee guys.

49
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Say those numbers again of how many guys were carrying 60s and stoners for us or carrying 60s and five guys carried stoners out of a 14 member to that's what we operated.

50
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So those used to fill in out there that are listening, that's a lot of firepower. That's that's a way you bring the thunder. And so where where'd you grow up though before you got the teams where to grow up.

51
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Basically my roots in what I look at my dad was a carpenter. So we moved quite a bit around but there was a place called Roanan Montana by the flat head lake in Montana.

52
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And I really have the mission range and a real real brief area. I grew up green breaking horses and stuff like that and building three houses and just working on my grandpa's farm and my uncle's ranch and stuff like that. So that's kind of where I grew up at.

53
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I lived a wild Phoenix Arizona and stuff like that and says here in the next thing sports where I played football outside lineback or I box for two years in high school.

54
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And I swam my dad built work on the tram and palms springs and when he was there I went to pond spring high school so I got on the water pole team there.

55
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So that's that's how you got a little comfortable in the water.

56
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Yeah. Oh yeah.

57
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So at what point what year was it when you actually decided you're going to join the Navy?

58
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I was 1965. And did you know already know about the seal teams? Well, no nobody's not about him.

59
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:54.000
My dad, like you said he was a carpenter but he was in UDT3 and it was at Swam on the in Chilin Harbor in Vietnam but I didn't I'm not getting I'm Korea but I didn't know anything about it because you never talked about it.

60
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Your dad was a frog. Yeah, but I mean that's I knew guys that knew him over older guys.

61
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I mean when I was young guy like he said you were your talking.

62
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So anyway, but he never said much about it but when I was a kid, you know I watched the bridges river quiet and the guns never owned and I also seen the marine sitting beaches and the Rangers getting wiped out and I went okay if you're going to fight you want to get something that you think you're going to come back with.

63
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
That's why I became a frog man and we didn't go through buds. It was UDT or a underwater demolition journey.

64
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So, you got, so you joined the Navy did, did you go straight to straight to underwater demolition journey?

65
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
No, no back in the day they wanted to have an A school.

66
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So I got a boot camp in 65, went to North Island in Coronado for about seven months waiting for my radio in school.

67
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And it was lucky enough to go to 22 weeks of radio in school.

68
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And then went from there to the US as Paul Rivera for about four months and then went to training.

69
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I started training January 6th, 1967.

70
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
How big was your classroom you showed up to that?

71
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
There was about, I don't know, 200 of us maybe, maybe 150.

72
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
How many guys made it?

73
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
There were about 30 of us that made it, which was pretty good and it was colder than shit.

74
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I don't know how you guys did when you went to training, Dr. Cobb.

75
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But we made a pack that we were going to land in but it quit.

76
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We did everything we could to make that happen.

77
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And some guys did make it through that we shouldn't have.

78
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Yeah, that's one of the, that's one of the things I've talked about with Lafayne is,

79
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
you see that and I was never in structure at buds, but eventually you say, you don't want to help people through.

80
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
They're not going to make it through on their own. You don't want them.

81
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
You know, you got to get guys that are going to get through it on their own.

82
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Yeah, but you know what I mean? Yeah, no.

83
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Yeah, no.

84
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We got close and we got a figure.

85
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
You know, I had a guy who was a previous fleet guy and he had been to buds before.

86
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And I became friends with his second class mature guy and I thought, yeah, this guy.

87
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I'm going to kind of follow his lead a little bit.

88
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
You know, second night of hell week, he quit.

89
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I was just, I was laughing.

90
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I'm like, oh, but here's a mature guy.

91
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Twenty seven years old, you know, I was a kid and he's quitting ridiculous.

92
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So then you, but when you got done with the initial UDTR A, you went to a, you checked it out.

93
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
UDT right? Yeah, he's really funny because, you know,

94
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
good friend of mine up in Flagstaffs, what are you joined in?

95
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
We decide we're going to be Marines, you know, so and he's dad, you go out of canal, you name us.

96
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
This is an uncles, D.I.s. you just a Marine, but he talked me into it too.

97
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So we went up to doing the Marines well.

98
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
That officers closed and right across the hallway was the Navy Recrearing.

99
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And there was a boesmete of the line, you know, lean against the, the door and he goes,

100
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
When he boys do, you know, we're going to join Marines, you know, which, you know, that's so good.

101
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And he goes, I asked the other guy, well, you're parents background, everything.

102
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And he's going to be a Marine, sorry, knew it. He was going to be a seven to two.

103
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Well, my dad was in the Navy, a chief in the dead as he says, come here, son.

104
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So my buddy went off to be a Marine, I went to Navy.

105
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
That close.

106
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Yeah, I think we all have a story like that.

107
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Yeah, I know really close.

108
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Yeah, I had a buddy Bruce. We saw, like, some ship pulled in and we saw guys,

109
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Marine uniforms and we were like, let's go join. Let's just go join.

110
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
That's how effective that recruiting to this. Oh, yeah, it's a lovely, I like it.

111
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
With a longer one. It wasn't open. You know, that's about the Marine and the Navy office is open.

112
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So it's a really nice office.

113
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And so he showed up at UDT and then what was the schedule there?

114
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I mean, the Vietnam War was already on. So now it's like, is it in 1966 now?

115
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
No, I didn't. Got one into UDT 67. I graduated in training,

116
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I was in the UDT. Yeah, the word been on. And then we had heard a little bit about

117
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
SIL team, but still didn't know very much about it.

118
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Because everybody I graduated with, these course and west course,

119
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
you went to a UDT team first. Then you did a trip with UDT.

120
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Then you came back and got in the SIL team.

121
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And how was that first trip with UDT?

122
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I was great. I was in a nine month trip and we had different debts that you went to

123
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
in Vietnam. Like first thing we did is go to Denang.

124
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Please, cold camp 10 shot and we worked up at Fueway, way, Quang 3,

125
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Dung Hall all over the northern part of South Vietnam.

126
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Doing demo work, different things, you know what I mean?

127
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And then we left that debt and went on the U.S.S. Tajanko.

128
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And we did about 110 miles of beach recon.

129
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And then from there, we went some of us went down to a debt in the...

130
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Will this hydrographic concert or whether just we had the college?

131
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
No, that's perpindic. Old school, perpindicular.

132
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
For parallel, not perpindic, but most from repair, we didn't do any perpindic,

133
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
or is that your combat, you know what I mean?

134
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So for those of you that don't know, the original job of one of the original jobs

135
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
the U.D.T. was to find out how deep the water is off of a beach.

136
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So an obstacle. And if there's any obstacles there,

137
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
that could trip up a boat that's coming in.

138
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And so you said you did 110 miles of that.

139
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Yeah, three months.

140
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
That's an interview. Basically you have to swim with a lead line.

141
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So you have a cord with a piece of lead on the bottom of it.

142
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
You've got different markings on it to tell you how deep how long it is.

143
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And you sit there and you swim along.

144
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And you rate every 25 meters.

145
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And you have a beach party on the beach.

146
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And it has a swim line going out.

147
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And we had a hook to an IBS.

148
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
In case we got intercepting that IBS can turn and get us out of the railroad.

149
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Grab onto the course of it's only a 9.5 or 5 region.

150
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So you didn't go out very fast.

151
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Yeah, you'll swim fast.

152
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
But every 25 meters, it takes sound means sound means sound means when you got back to the

153
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Dachinko then the photographer, which I was lucky enough to be one, you do a

154
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
A hydrographic chart.

155
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
When I got the UDT 12, you know, you're pretty regimen it.

156
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And I'll call it by as it was UDT.

157
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
It'd be a pretty regimen.

158
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But when we got there, our proteins were even formed up.

159
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And you were kind of lost at sea.

160
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
You know, I mean, no, he's really telling you what you have to do.

161
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
You're not in the plutonium.

162
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And it was kind of floating.

163
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I mean, we went up and did lifeguard stuff for the Marines when I did land

164
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Theumsupite penalty time stuff like that.

165
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
It wasn't really a lot to do.

166
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
You know, we're going to Jesus.

167
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
You know, play volleyball lot.

168
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
You know, ran around your UDT's and four boots.

169
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And you know, so then we started forming up and how UDT worked is that

170
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
You'd, they'd be home for nine months.

171
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And then the whole team would deploy and relieve the team that was out

172
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
There, like we were really duty to 11.

173
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And the level would come back nine months later, they would come out and

174
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Relieve us.

175
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So as nine months deployments and almost port and starboard,

176
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
You didn't have like a year and a half, two years of work.

177
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
That was about nine months.

178
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And then months home with a work up.

179
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And there was the work up.

180
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
What did you do in the work up?

181
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Oh, we did everything.

182
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We did recon.

183
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
We did demolition raids.

184
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We did river recon.

185
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So we just, how many guys were in the UDT pool team?

186
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
18 or 20.

187
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Maybe it might have been 20.

188
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
It was quite a bad because you got this one relying on the party and all that other stuff.

189
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
You know, that's why we did the old part.

190
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
We always try to get a couple extra guys because we didn't cover more beach.

191
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
It should same do.

192
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Yeah.

193
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And everything you did on and we'd do just, it was just a lot.

194
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
You know, I mean, and it was a lot of physical work too.

195
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And everything.

196
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
UDT actually went into training.

197
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I think we did about 50 times more swimming than the guys doing bugs now.

198
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Because that's what we were real frog men.

199
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
You know, so.

200
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Yeah, that's a lot of the future more swimming than we did a bug.

201
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
That's a lot of swim.

202
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I'm glad I went through bugs instead of that.

203
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Well, they're surf out there and January is pretty cool.

204
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Yeah, there's no doubt.

205
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And when you were there, you tell me before about some of the kind of hook and onto some of the conventional units on some of their operations that they did with the, I think it was the 19th century.

206
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Yeah, so we were down in the Delta.

207
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I know, we were doing river recon's.

208
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And I think we're the ones that ever did with this.

209
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000
They called them the darts and it would look like a jet ski, but you laid on it and you got it with your feet.

210
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And had a 355 degree camera up on top and a father on the bottom of it.

211
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And it had a piece of aluminum like this of course.

212
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
So you wouldn't get hit with a prop's of stuff.

213
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And the handles were on the right and left.

214
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
You don't understand.

215
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And they went up to about 30 knots.

216
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
What they would do is take two of us either by chopper, something drop us in a canal.

217
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
It would come down that canal.

218
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Then we got back.

219
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
We do a chart of that.

220
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And that would let the 19th century in their river in boats.

221
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
No, if they could go up there and do a landing or not, that's one of the things we did.

222
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Of course, you only would down the river.

223
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Maybe once or twice and you didn't go down any more.

224
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I was too, which you care for, which you carry like a side arm when you're on that way.

225
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Yeah, we had a 45 in front of the cover there.

226
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And that's what we had.

227
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
We had a black jacket on a helmet, UD keys and.

228
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And we had a tight weather fee.

229
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Which you do tonight or the daytime?

230
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
A daytime.

231
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Oh, day.

232
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And then, you know, with that 350 degree camera across,

233
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
canals coming into pagoda.

234
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Is anything that was a known thing you could find on a map.

235
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Would take a picture of as we went down.

236
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
You tried to stay at the same speed all the way down.

237
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Because otherwise your your chart wouldn't be good.

238
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
But we could really did that.

239
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
We couldn't do it too much. So, I mean, just a different rivers and different canals and stuff.

240
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
So, we got bored.

241
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So, we started going out with the 9th century on those river boats to be their demolition guys.

242
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Blow a bunker.

243
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And sometimes they put log dams across the river.

244
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
We blow those up and stuff.

245
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And we took some heavies on that doing that.

246
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
So, it looks sort of kind of situations to get in when you're writing up with a 9th

247
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Infantry.

248
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Well, we got caught in ambush one time.

249
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
They usually had about 7.5, 6.7 boats.

250
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
They had a boat in the front called an alphabet.

251
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
It looked like your old,

252
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Monterne and the Civil War.

253
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And then they had like the landing craft.

254
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
They had those with bar armor and the side.

255
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And then they had 50s up on top and back there that old build up.

256
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And they had bar armor.

257
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
So, that if a B40 rocket punch suit and they had real thick styrofoam.

258
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So, that would just be channeled into one area if they hit them from the sides.

259
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And they had 30s, 230s on each side.

260
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Each one of the landing craft type of boats that they put the troops in.

261
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And right in the middle of that was what they call monitor.

262
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
You've seen that.

263
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
That was that's over in Cismfield.

264
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
That's a great big boat.

265
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And then to back they had another alphabet.

266
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And then all the ones in between.

267
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
So, who was the, what are those navy boats?

268
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Were they army boats?

269
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
No, they're navy.

270
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
They were navy guys doing, I wouldn't have that job for anything.

271
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Yeah, no.

272
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So, anyway, we was going up and a group at one of the before-estrops.

273
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
There are people off.

274
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
They came right by us.

275
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
As soon as we got by them, they opened up on us.

276
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And then it was a bad day.

277
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
We had 30 killed in 70 wounded Americans.

278
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Yeah.

279
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And like the alphabet had of us.

280
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Everybody but one guy was killed on.

281
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And that boat was floating by and still the American flag flying.

282
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And there was one guy on the back on the 30 still shooting.

283
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I mean, it was, you know, it still almost quacks me up.

284
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Not quacks me up and tears me up when I think about that.

285
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
But it was just, that's the American flag.

286
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
You know, that's the way we are.

287
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
So, not give those riverbow guys all the credit in the world on those tango boats.

288
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Because they're just sitting targets, you know.

289
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
And then after we got hit of course, we all got, we, we're in the fourth boat back.

290
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
And we heard number one boats hit.

291
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
That was the, number two boats hit.

292
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Number three boats hit.

293
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
We're number four boat.

294
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
There were three of us shooting T guys.

295
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And I've both never remember looking over again.

296
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
He went, you go on work fucked.

297
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Excuse me, I shouldn't have said it.

298
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Anyway, then we got hit, blew us all down and stuff.

299
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And I've, one of everybody's had about 53 pieces wrapped running.

300
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
So I called it over to him and hitting with morphine.

301
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Got up in the Navy.

302
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Got blown off the 30.

303
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
You know, so I shoot in that until I round our rounds and shit.

304
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Well, the other guy, I know that was, I got hit.

305
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
The other guy saw tall mess up.

306
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
So he goes over and didn't see my pins who was collar.

307
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
So he had seen with another shooting more.

308
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
She didn't.

309
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
He lived.

310
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
And then me and,

311
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I mean, we just, our shooting was the sides and stuff.

312
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And the army guys wouldn't get up and shoot there.

313
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Handing us up weapons or shoot.

314
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Well, sometimes I'm giving them to us and we're up there hammering down.

315
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Sometimes you get a frog band up.

316
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Then the cobras came in in army cobras and,

317
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
holes everything down real good.

318
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
So what they were, they doing like an actual landing.

319
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
That's what the purpose was.

320
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And they were going to get a beach foothold that work an area for a while.

321
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Work to make a sweep through there and don't ask me why the Marines weren't doing it.

322
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
We had the night.

323
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I tell you why the Marines weren't doing it.

324
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Was there a hole in the DMZ up in the north?

325
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
They shouldn't Marines.

326
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
That's their job.

327
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
But the ninth infantry did a good job.

328
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Yeah.

329
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Well, I know you haven't listened to this podcast much,

330
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
but I know you have, you have read the book that that lay for me.

331
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And you know that I have nothing but nothing but the most utter

332
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
highest respect for the Marines and the army units that we work with

333
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
were just phenomenal.

334
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And the sacrifices that they made in the bravery they showed on the battlefield

335
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
was unbelievable on a daily basis.

336
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
So I know it's definitely something.

337
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
And you think about this now.

338
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Think of the training that we went through just for UDT to start with.

339
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And then I came back meeting with the seal team.

340
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
So you get all the what you guys call a SKT.

341
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
We call it Cadbury back in the day.

342
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And then you go over again.

343
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
You've already had your feet in the gun.

344
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Now you figure these army guys go through basic training.

345
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And a lot of them had right over the Vietnam.

346
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
You know what I mean?

347
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And they could be in Shal Valley anywhere.

348
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And where the crap probably hit the hit the brick and you imagine that.

349
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
We had the training.

350
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
We were volunteers.

351
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
We volunteered for what we're going to do.

352
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
We weren't just saying here.

353
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
You know we knew exactly where we were going to go.

354
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
And we wanted to go.

355
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
You know what I mean?

356
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
So yeah.

357
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Yeah.

358
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
You know another weird thing about Vietnam.

359
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I've talked a lot about Vietnam books from Vietnam.

360
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Guys that from that were Vietnam here.

361
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
And you know, the fact that these guys would rotate out.

362
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
You'd be in the middle of the deployment.

363
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
You just, you know, guys were just rotating out all the time.

364
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
You know, it wasn't like what you just described what you did in the seal teams and in

365
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
UDT.

366
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And what we still do in the seal teams now is you get with your guys.

367
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
You go through a work up with those guys together as a team.

368
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Then you go on deployment together as a team and you come home together as a team.

369
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
And the army guys, they would just, yeah, they're just filling in the holes and the guy would go home.

370
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
And another guy would take his place.

371
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
So you never work with this.

372
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
You know, you could have a guy on a patrol with you two or three guys.

373
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
You never work with before you're going out of patrol with him.

374
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
So it's, uh, I don't like that system.

375
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
I like the way we do it.

376
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
We might be a force company.

377
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
You know, that was, well, where you get a little thing.

378
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
You know, what happened?

379
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
No, the new guys that came into the platoon.

380
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
You know, was it?

381
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Oh, yeah, I was checking in.

382
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Yeah.

383
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Everybody's already been there already.

384
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
They're just coming in.

385
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
They hadn't worked up with these guys.

386
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Nothing.

387
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
They were just showing up.

388
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
You know, poppin' in.

389
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
We actually did take a couple guys in when I was in the body.

390
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
We took a couple guys that just showed up.

391
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
We just got a new guy's and we just had to slowly, you know, put him in the watch.

392
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
What did you have?

393
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
People that were taking out.

394
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
That's why they came in.

395
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And they were just guys that were filling in.

396
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
We did.

397
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
We lost guys, but they were just guys that they, they got sent to seal team three from SQT.

398
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
And when they got there, there's no one there.

399
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
So they brought him over on the plinit.

400
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
A couple guys was like two or three guys.

401
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And we just, you know, okay, here's, we made a work in the compound for a while.

402
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And then maybe bring them out.

403
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
They'd be a turret gunner on top and maybe eventually get let them do the work.

404
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Yeah, that's pretty obvious what you should do it.

405
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And so any other, any other, any other, then,

406
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
And then we used to teach stuff, yeah, so another time we were,

407
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
We used to be on the front boat, the alpha boat,

408
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
because they're, were the first ones that saw the log dams or

409
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
we didn't had to blow a bunkers in shit.

410
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And we had about a big stack of sea-fjorn in the back, you know,

411
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
the haversax in shit, you know, and also in the whole boat.

412
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
It shook like this. We got to be 40 rock at right in one of the exhaust tubes.

413
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
And we started sinking.

414
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
So we, they give the cocks and ran it to shore and everything.

415
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
And we were shooting back and everything, but the fucking boat was sinking.

416
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
And if that had been about another eight inches higher to hit all that sea-fjorn.

417
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
But we landed, and then we swam off and got out in the river

418
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
and this other, they called it a zip-able.

419
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
It was like the tube carry in both of us. It was all napon,

420
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
or not napon, whatever they got in flames, the worst, you know?

421
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Oh, flames for our boat.

422
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Okay.

423
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And this thing just went on the beach and on we went and climbed up on that.

424
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
We got out of there.

425
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
That's in the crewman.

426
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
That was, that was an other moment of excitement.

427
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
You know, it's, it's just to go off of what you just said to,

428
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
with the training that you get in special operations.

429
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
The old teams, whatever, Rangers, SF.

430
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
These, you know, a lot of times we, in special operations, get a lot of praise for doing what we do.

431
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And that's great and everything.

432
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
But like what you're talking about, being in a conventional unit,

433
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
it's the same thing over in Iraq and Afghanistan, being a conventional guy.

434
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
It's no joke.

435
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I mean, it's, in many cases, they're doing a much more dangerous job.

436
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
I mean, even, you know, logistics jobs, something like that,

437
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
where they're exposing themselves on a regular basis.

438
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
So anybody out there that's a civilian that thinks that the conventional guys

439
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
aren't doing, you know, aren't taking as many risks as a special operation.

440
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Guys, I'm telling you right now, they absolutely are.

441
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
They absolutely are.

442
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
And of course, there's things that that all special ops guys do that,

443
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
step it up as well.

444
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
But everybody, everybody pays a price and everybody takes a lot of risk when they go over there.

445
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And it sounds like it was the same thing when you had the ninth infantry roll and up the river.

446
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Yeah, those guys were good.

447
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
They didn't do jobs and if I seem to say anything,

448
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
derogatory, I apologize.

449
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Oh, no, you didn't.

450
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
You didn't at all.

451
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
You didn't at all.

452
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I'm just pointing out a lot of times.

453
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Again, people, I'm sitting here thinking,

454
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
I'm thinking exactly what you just said, here you are,

455
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
you're easy to, you've been through all this training and you,

456
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
you know, when that boat starts thinking, you're like, hey,

457
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I'm going to jump on the swim.

458
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
There's a regular army guys there.

459
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
They're, they're thinking they haven't had the training that you had.

460
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And yet they're still in the same almost the same exact situation.

461
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
So one other thing in duty,

462
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
we're doing a beach recon and I was like a photographer,

463
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
so I'm up in front with another guy and I'm at this big huge piece of

464
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
plexiglass.

465
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
I'm doing all the back-sour information on,

466
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
but I'm ahead of him.

467
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
We're putting in the stakes.

468
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
So the guys behind us can hit every 25 meters and do their sound needs and stuff.

469
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Well, we didn't usually we had Arvan,

470
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
which are your south-eastern,

471
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
the Meas Army or we had Marines that would do screening force.

472
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
You know, when we were doing the beach recon,

473
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
so we couldn't get either one of them.

474
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
So we had two of our own guys doing it.

475
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
So there were walkin' going behind.

476
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
It was all, a lot of sand dunes and stuff like that on the beach.

477
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
You know, trees, little forces of,

478
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
well, we almost walked right into his L-shaped ambush

479
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
that they had set up force except the two guys back here.

480
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
They had a spider hole back here,

481
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
so that when we fell back from the ambush,

482
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
we'd show off any of us were still living.

483
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
These guys would get us right.

484
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
They hit these guys.

485
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
So I made them open up, which made them open up earlier,

486
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
then we leapfrog down and got out of there.

487
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
But that was a few moments of excitement too.

488
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And that's when I got back to the USS-Dyshink,

489
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
and I went, you know,

490
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
screwed this naked warrior shit.

491
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Tell me how sexy it can be,

492
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
I'm gonna be glad, nothing's got to do it.

493
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I don't like running down the beach and UDTs,

494
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I'm gonna call a boot shoot in M79,

495
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
even heads down and shit, you know what I mean?

496
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Yeah, it was, but I was just UDTs,

497
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
and so I didn't talk too much about it, you know,

498
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I wasn't a seal.

499
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
So you get back from that deployment.

500
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

501
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Every month when I was on that deployment,

502
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
I mean, I got him,

503
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
we'd put in a chip to go to the seal team,

504
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
and they'd just cheer or ask us out,

505
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
he ain't going anywhere until we get back, you know.

506
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
All right, so we'd wait a month and put another cheat in.

507
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
And when we got back, boom, we weren't right to a,

508
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Cadry, go and check into SILT-1 and then went into Cadry.

509
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And the counter trading was what we call now,

510
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
SILT, SILT, SILT.

511
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
All your ID's, all that stuff,

512
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
and actually on the Alimal River,

513
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
and a few other places they had it set up to be exactly like,

514
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
it would be in Vietnam with watched little watch towers,

515
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
and they had a whole village that was in amongst all the shit

516
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
that's on the side of the Alimal River and stuff.

517
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
It was really good turning.

518
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Yeah.

519
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
And then we'd do that ambush ass with ambush them,

520
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
they'd come down in, you know,

521
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
sand pans we had there and stuff like that.

522
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
And just like on a, you know,

523
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
you do an ambush on a river,

524
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
you always want to try to do it at a curve,

525
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
and hit them.

526
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
So that way the sand pans after you hit them and stuff

527
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
or flown to the bank.

528
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
And keep on going down the river and you can't get enough of them.

529
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Just all kinds of little tricks.

530
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
And what they did, our cadry,

531
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
that ran us through the,

532
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
our cadry instructors were guys that had just gotten back

533
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
and they pulled them out of the platoon to do that for about six months

534
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
before they went back into another blue tune.

535
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
So we were getting continuous guys right out of the field,

536
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
and we had an arm which is all good in different areas too.

537
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
The triple canopy shed, your mangrove stuff,

538
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
and you know the race paddies and all that stuff like that.

539
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Where would you do a bulk of the training?

540
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Oh, out of the nightland.

541
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And then we'd go up to Quimacca for map and compass and stuff.

542
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And then a bunch of us went through what they called

543
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
sealed van training,

544
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
which is for your proof program,

545
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
which was five months long.

546
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
And that was all tree graph medical and stuff like that.

547
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Really, really good. Got really honed in more even on the I.D.s.

548
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
and stuff like that.

549
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
We would be trapped trails, in kale trails, all kinds of stuff here.

550
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
It's interesting as you talk about that,

551
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
how much of that stuff carried on to you.

552
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
When I showed up at Zilting, but one,

553
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
you know, we did the all we did booby trap trails.

554
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
You know, there was no more than a minute of work going on for 20 years when I got there.

555
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
You know, in the Gulf War,

556
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
but we still did booby trap trails.

557
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
We did point mancourses.

558
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
We did the medical stuff.

559
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
We did river ambushes.

560
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
It's awesome that that.

561
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
And there was no,

562
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
it wasn't really written down anywhere.

563
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
That's yeah, you should add two weeks of advanced demo and catch in table demo.

564
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Oh yeah, because we sent all that up until the one I know it's you had.

565
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Shoulda, she'll been going.

566
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
But that's awesome that it lasted that long.

567
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
You know, with no,

568
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
because the weird thing about seal team is,

569
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
we didn't used to have anything written down.

570
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
It was barely anything written down.

571
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
And so all that knowledge was passed word amount from guy to guy to guy.

572
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
And that's,

573
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
I think we've corrected that now where we capture more of the stuff.

574
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
You might, but you know,

575
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
you have everyone in fight rangers.

576
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Get the ranger handbook.

577
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
That's the only thing I had against that little bit.

579
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
It still should stay in house.

580
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
It should be rolled down,

581
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
but you know what I'm saying?

582
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Yeah.

583
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.000
I don't, you know,

584
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
I can give you a ranger handbook.

585
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Can you can find out exactly how those guys are going to fight.

586
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
What their methods are, everything.

587
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
And another thing I've talked about

588
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
on here is when you have doctrine,

589
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
and you get tasks with something that's not the doctrine,

590
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
you get confused.

591
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
You know, what to do.

592
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Yeah, that's one of the, that's one of the reasons I think seal teams have been very successful

593
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
in the recent past and even in the, even in the longer past is because

594
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
we didn't have a book to look at.

595
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
We had to figure out how to do it.

596
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
And so no matter what the mission is,

597
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
we always had a fresh look at it in the,

598
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
we adapt.

599
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
We're in North of the Docks, we adapt.

600
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
I mean,

601
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.000
you know,

602
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
our guys,

603
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
if you had pulled a platoon right out of Vietnam and put them in

604
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
the water.

605
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
You know,

606
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
I know you wouldn't have been lost in the sea.

607
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
You know,

608
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
you know,

609
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
you wouldn't have been lost in sea.

610
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.000
You know,

611
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
because it's the principles of the same,

612
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
the same principle that you guys taught me was the same thing we did over there.

613
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
We'd have figured it out.

614
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Cover,

615
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
move,

616
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
take the high ground.

617
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Yeah,

618
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
we would have figured out,

619
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.000
but,

620
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
you know,

621
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
we didn't have overwatches.

622
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
There's something like that.

623
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
When it's a pitch target night,

624
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
you know,

625
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
working a way through real quiet,

626
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
not making a lot of noise.

627
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Everything you do is for,

628
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
you know,

629
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
being silent or just like,

630
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
you guys never have to do things like,

631
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
you know,

632
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
hit a real taunt line,

633
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
the point scout did,

634
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
who had stepped over and grabbed the guy behind him,

635
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
bring his hand down,

636
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
show him where that wire was.

637
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And he had stepped over the wire,

638
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
he had put his,

639
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
layover,

640
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
grabbed the guy behind him,

641
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
and that's how we got across until we got everybody across and got a head count.

642
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
They wouldn't move on.

643
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
That's just when we trapped stuff.

644
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
You know what I mean?

645
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
We,

646
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
that's just,

647
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
and you didn't,

648
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
you couldn't see it was pitch black.

649
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
That's why we have the guys hand,

650
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
showed him where it was.

651
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
And if it's a tie one,

652
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
you don't cut it.

653
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
If it's all loose and stuff,

654
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.000
then yeah,

655
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
cut it.

656
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.000
So,

657
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
how would the wood,

658
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
how would the plant man see that?

659
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Yeah,

660
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.000
yeah,

661
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
what they called,

662
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
we used,

663
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
you take a,

664
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
a,

665
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
a twig,

666
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.000
a long,

667
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
a string on the real,

668
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
no,

669
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
no string on it.

670
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
But just like a fish and pull,

671
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
and you just run that up and down like that,

672
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
when moved and you'd feel it,

673
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
just like you would,

674
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
if you got a trout or a bite,

675
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
and then you work your hand down,

676
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
you reach over there and feel,

677
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
and see what that is.

678
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Yeah.

679
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
And ninja.

680
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Yeah.

681
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
You know what the other,

682
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
the other interesting thing that,

683
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
when you started talking about,

684
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
sealed him and going out at night time,

685
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
and how that was all,

686
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
on orthodox and people were doing it,

687
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
is the opposite of when we were in the body,

688
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
we started going out the daytime.

689
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
And the reason we started going out the day,

690
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
there was a bunch of reasons why we started going out the day time,

691
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
but one of the main reasons was the enemy,

692
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
knew that we owned the night.

693
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
We had night vision,

694
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.000
we had that,

695
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
we,

696
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
we owned the night.

697
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And so they didn't want to go out at night.

698
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
And today,

699
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.000
when out daytime,

700
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
that's when they felt planted their ideas,

701
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
it's when they killed people,

702
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
that's what,

703
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
and so we went out the daytime,

704
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
because that's where the bad guys were out.

705
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Well,

706
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.000
yeah,

707
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
daytime and bed,

708
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
and I'm two years ago,

709
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
sleeping and hammocks and shared with rats,

710
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
moping because we knew there had been out of night doing shit,

711
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
so we wanted to talk to them.

712
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
You know,

713
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
just like a rules of engagement shit,

714
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
when we got my last platoon,

715
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
we stopped in Saigon,

716
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
and went to Mac for a V in our LT got his orders.

717
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
His orders were pacified,

718
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
the Van Long Province.

719
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Wow.

720
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
That was his orders.

721
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Pacified the Van Long Province.

722
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Roger that.

723
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
And that's where we went off and did it.

724
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
You know,

725
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
no rules of engagement,

726
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
nothing just pacified,

727
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
and then there was like,

728
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
okay.

729
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Yeah.

730
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
That's that.

731
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
And we didn't work for the Army,

732
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Navy,

733
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Marines or anybody.

734
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
We were all in the,

735
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
so if you'd been the old till the day of Jockel,

736
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
you'd have,

737
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
you'd have the con.

738
00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
We would have a con.

739
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Matter of fact,

740
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
we were at Don Tam,

741
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
they had an able base here,

742
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
and then the big Army base here at Don Tam.

743
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
They had a stay on the Vietnamese Navy base,

744
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
in between them,

745
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
because the Navy didn't really want us on their base.

746
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Plus their boats are right down there on the work,

747
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
so it worked out perfect,

748
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
you know what I mean?

749
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
You go to the Army to,

750
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
you know,

751
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
test our West side,

752
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
and check stuff.

753
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Yeah,

754
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
and they were doing that all the time,

755
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
so it wasn't like,

756
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
you know what I mean?

757
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
It wasn't anything unusual, you know what I mean?

758
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
So,

759
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
going back now,

760
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
you get back from your first deployment with UDT.

761
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
You go to the C.L.T.

762
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
and you show up,

763
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
you're going through the train.

764
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
What was the,

765
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:35.000
what was the,

766
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
you kind of talked to me a little bit about this before,

767
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
but how are you getting treated?

768
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Because you got,

769
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
you got wounded on your first deployment as a UDT.

770
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
So here you are,

771
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
your combat veteran,

772
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
you've been in the shit,

773
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
you've been wounded.

774
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
We call it a day at Kong and Cheeman,

775
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
not that.

776
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
So,

777
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
so you show up at C.L.T.1.

778
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
You're kind of like,

779
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.000
hey,

780
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
I'm a experienced veteran.

781
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
I've been through the shit.

782
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
And that means shit.

783
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
And they just,

784
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
the guys there,

785
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
how they treat you.

786
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Well,

787
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
I mean,

788
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
all right,

789
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
just the same.

790
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
I mean,

791
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I had a trip with UDT,

792
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
but just about everybody

793
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
that went into C.L.T.

794
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
came out of UDT,

795
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
11 or 12 into C.L.T.

796
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
You know what I mean?

797
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Back in the day,

798
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
before they started bringing them right into a seal team,

799
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
the new guys,

800
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
you know?

801
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
So it wasn't any different to the guys there.

802
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
You just had to learn.

803
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
I mean,

804
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
you know,

805
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
when I was in UDT,

806
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
I'd tell you,

807
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
I wish they really wanted to go.

808
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Like when we were at Donknam,

809
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
that was during the 67,

810
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
68,

811
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
and we got a call that the East Coast for

812
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Tuning,

813
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
the Meetall,

814
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
which wasn't too far away from Donknam,

815
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
was being overran,

816
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
literally they were up in a tall building,

817
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
so they held out real good.

818
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
They were the tallest building,

819
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
and they had a 57,

820
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
and they called us,

821
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
and you can hear the VC coming up

822
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
the stairways that throw grenades down and shit like that.

823
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
And they needed some help,

824
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
and they were about 17 of us down on that

825
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
dark patrol on the USS Benoelle,

826
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
right by Donknam,

827
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
and we begged our lieutenant,

828
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
down let us go in there.

829
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
We'd have been fucking killed.

830
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Our heart was there,

831
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
but we didn't have the IED training,

832
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
media reaction,

833
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
you know,

834
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.000
I mean,

835
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
none of that shit.

836
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.000
I mean,

837
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
we'd have been.

838
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
It would have been stupid,

839
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
so oldies,

840
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
our lieutenant said,

841
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.000
no,

842
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
we hated him,

843
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.000
you know,

844
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
then I got back and went to a

845
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
cadre or SQT

846
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
and did all that stuff,

847
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
and then deployed next time I saw John Odech,

848
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
I hugged him,

849
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.000
I said,

850
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
you're just one smart son of a bitch,

851
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
dude.

852
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Our heart was there,

853
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
you don't have to be,

854
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
but UDT,

855
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
you just weren't trained to operate on land.

856
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
You didn't have the,

857
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
the pre-risk,

858
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
get skills that you learn

859
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
and then you're going to be

860
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
in the SQT and stuff, you know what I mean?

861
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And you get more of that even in

862
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Buds now than we ever got,

863
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
because we were trying to be a frogman,

864
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
that was it.

865
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
I mean,

866
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.000
our last,

867
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.000
uh,

868
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
off we did at San Camini Island,

869
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
who was,

870
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
we swim or scouted in by

871
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Birdshet Rock,

872
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
and I can tell you,

873
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
did you know,

874
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
I'm talking about,

875
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
they gave us 40 pounds of demo,

876
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
have a sack,

877
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
we went 26 miles down

878
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
the other end of the island,

879
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
blew up a target,

880
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
and came 26 miles back

881
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
and attacked the camp,

882
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
guys as we were

883
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
patrolling,

884
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
that ambushes,

885
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
and then pick out guys that

886
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
been killed pretty soon,

887
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
we were all followed down,

888
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
they'd go,

889
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
God damn it,

890
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
would tell you who we shot,

891
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
then they'd get to go back to

892
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
camp and defend it when we came back

893
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
and attacked it.

894
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
But it was still just a demo

895
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
raid, you know what I mean?

896
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
It wasn't anything,

897
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.000
uh,

898
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
patrolling real good,

899
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
patrolling tactics,

900
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
and all that stuff that you learn.

901
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
You don't mean,

902
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
I mean,

903
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
like I went out with the Australian SAS

904
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
in a newly-de-edit,

905
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
and did a week out in the field,

906
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
I was a week,

907
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
or was it two weeks?

908
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Was this when you were at Team One,

909
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
or at Team One?

910
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
My second but tuned,

911
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
two of us,

912
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
we had the Aussies come down and work with us,

913
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
and they loved it,

914
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
and we went up to Newy Dept,

915
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
and I was just 60 guy,

916
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
we went up and went out with them,

917
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
we did a 10 day patrol with them,

918
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
resupplying all this,

919
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
if they never talked,

920
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
said one word,

921
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
that hope a patrol is all hand in arm signals,

922
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
that's awesome,

923
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
and they would get an LUP at night,

924
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
everybody with their feet out,

925
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
and you'd land on your pat,

926
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
have your weapon right,

927
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
actually pull what they call the silky up,

928
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
and you'd go to sleep,

929
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
when we didn't sleep for about two nights,

930
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
because that's when we usually went out and worked,

931
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
then we started to,

932
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
because the way they figured it,

933
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
there was an arulnois area,

934
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
and somebody in that circle would be awake,

935
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
and if we got sprung or something,

936
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
then you have 360 degree firepower,

937
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
and we got out of there.

938
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
But they were the best I've ever seen,

939
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
I've been to, I went to Army Ranger School,

940
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
a radar group school,

941
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
and everything in that one 10 day patrol

942
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
of the Australians,

943
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
I learned more about reconnaissance,

944
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
and I did anywhere, anywhere.

945
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
We used to have guys from that say,

946
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
that's come to come to Team I,

947
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
that's metaphor, yeah.

948
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
They did,

949
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
we had that program for a long time,

950
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
but the last guy we had there was an officer,

951
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
and he was worth the ship,

952
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
but some of the sergeants we had.

953
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
The guys that, that were there when I showed up,

954
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
were really square-to-wear guys that definitely had their field craft down.

955
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Oh, they're so good.

956
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
That's what I was trying to say.

957
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Yeah, a field craft.

958
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
We did, and UDT,

959
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
you just didn't have the field craft

960
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
beyond the jungle looking for people,

961
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
and shit, you know,

962
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
that's why in UDT 13,

963
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
some of the guys got killed,

964
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
stuff down trails,

965
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
and shit like that,

966
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
they didn't, you know what I mean?

967
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Got it kind of heavy,

968
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
shit together a little bit.

969
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Yeah.

970
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000
So you go,

971
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
go through the cadre training,

972
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
you check into your platoon,

973
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
and it's time to go into point,

974
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
are you flying out of North Island?

975
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Yeah, we fly out of North Island,

976
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
and my first platoon,

977
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
we flew into

978
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Camron Bay,

979
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
and then took choppers down to a place called

980
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
New Namcan,

981
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
which is the very southern part of South Vietnam,

982
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
right by a place that called the UDT in Forest.

983
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
It needed to do some turnover-offs

984
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
with the other platoons that were there.

985
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
No turnover-offs.

986
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
We didn't at that time.

987
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Matter of fact, most of our officer,

988
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
dark boardoffs,

989
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
yeah, we heard of those.

990
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
That's where you put a map behind you,

991
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
choosing one of the guys in the platoon.

992
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
You saw a dark behind you,

993
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
where that dark hits is where you're going to go into.

994
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Because we didn't have intel,

995
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
we didn't have shit,

996
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
we were pretty isolated,

997
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
we were in a Vietnamese base camp,

998
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
and BFE-Jep,

999
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
you know what I mean?

1000
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
So that's how we went out.

1001
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Is it what you do in helicopter insert or a river insert?

1002
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
All river in,

1003
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
and actually out of a

1004
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
new Namcan where we were,

1005
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
would take sand pans out,

1006
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
because we didn't even have any MST support or anything.

1007
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
The guys down at Seaflow did,

1008
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
which is a ways of way from the entire other squad was there.

1009
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
And finally, they pulled us out of new Namcan,

1010
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
because we weren't,

1011
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
we were doing stuff,

1012
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
but it wasn't,

1013
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
wasn't effective.

1014
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
It wasn't real strategic.

1015
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
So they brought us down to Seaflow,

1016
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
then we started getting some good ups down there.

1017
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
They didn't want those ups like.

1018
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
We still did river inops,

1019
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
like we went down to a place called Square Bay,

1020
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
and because we heard there was a prison

1021
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
or work camp and stayed down there for about three days.

1022
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Watching this trails,

1023
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
seeing if we can see him moving and stuff like that.

1024
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
We'd do ambushes,

1025
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
we'd get intel from our Navy Nile,

1026
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
which still wasn't that good.

1027
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Oh, one of the things in 1969,

1028
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
that was first of the tunes in 1969,

1029
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
was we landed at New Namcan,

1030
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
got her stuff off the old 46th of the land in it,

1031
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
there and put it in the bunker,

1032
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
and then this little load came in and landed,

1033
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
you know,

1034
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
no, I don't know his name,

1035
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
he was a prude guy in that province,

1036
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
that we were in down there.

1037
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
So he came in and told us,

1038
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
you guys need anything,

1039
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
just let us know,

1040
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
and this is that load to left.

1041
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
We got mortar for about an hour and a half.

1042
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
So we told him never to come there again,

1043
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
because they knew what that load to it.

1044
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
He was a prude,

1045
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.000
you know,

1046
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
that was a prude guy.

1047
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Now,

1048
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
that was a great guy.

1049
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
But,

1050
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.000
yeah,

1051
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
and he was a prude and long hair,

1052
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
you know, bearded, you know.

1053
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
It's a little,

1054
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
the tune set up was,

1055
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
yeah,

1056
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
an OIC and a OIC,

1057
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
a Petune Chief and an LPL kind of like what you'd run.

1058
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Well,

1059
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
what we'd ran into.

1060
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
And two squads.

1061
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
The LPL,

1062
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
and just like what you'd do.

1063
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Just the same one,

1064
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
exactly,

1065
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
yeah.

1066
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
And then we broke it down,

1067
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
you know,

1068
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.000
to mean,

1069
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
yeah,

1070
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
you're like,

1071
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
I was with the A OIC.

1072
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
And the last Petune I was in was with,

1073
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
was with,

1074
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
was my A OIC.

1075
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Really?

1076
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Yeah.

1077
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Well, you know,

1078
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
that was,

1079
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
when was that 89?

1080
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Damn.

1081
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Yeah.

1082
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Yeah,

1083
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
that's awesome.

1084
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
But he was,

1085
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
I must be at fun.

1086
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Yeah,

1087
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
he was a great guy.

1088
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Awesome.

1089
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
But I'm just saying he was easy.

1090
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
A OIC was the OIC.

1091
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Yeah.

1092
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.000
So,

1093
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
We had the LPL would work with him.

1094
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
And then I would,

1095
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
you know,

1096
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
I have,

1097
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
you know,

1098
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
the kind of guy he was,

1099
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
I was a senior kid.

1100
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
And that's awesome.

1101
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Yeah.

1102
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
That's awesome.

1103
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
I don't know if you knew anything.

1104
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I don't know if you knew anything.

1105
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I don't know if you knew anything.

1106
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Yeah.

1107
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Yeah.

1108
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
They're all in my platoon.

1109
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Yeah.

1110
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
With my radio and horse radio,

1111
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
whatever had my life,

1112
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
you know.

1113
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Yeah.

1114
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
I could imagine.

1115
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Oh, you know,

1116
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
I could tell you,

1117
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
yeah.

1118
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Guess you never carried a radio on the team.

1119
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Really?

1120
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
You never carried a radio?

1121
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:20.000
No,

1122
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
It's a 60-gunner day.

1123
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Two-way media appeal.

1124
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Then I went to the M14.

1125
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
I like the 76-2 round.

1126
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Yeah.

1127
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.000
That's the,

1128
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
that's kind of the same.

1129
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
When I went to the rescue team,

1130
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
they told us if you're not carrying a,

1131
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
I didn't 14.

1132
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
You're wrong.

1133
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Yeah.

1134
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Oh, yeah.

1135
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
That's a great weapon.

1136
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
It's accurate.

1137
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
It's perfect.

1138
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:39.000
I love the game.

1139
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
And guys,

1140
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
even a bunch of guys were a body carry the M14 as well.

1141
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Yeah.

1142
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Because they're shooting, you know, you shoot at vehicles, you shoot,

1143
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
you shoot, you do buildings shooting.

1144
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And they put the,

1145
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
the,

1146
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
our AP rounds in there.

1147
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
And just,

1148
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Yeah.

1149
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
That we don't got some.

1150
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
You can,

1151
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
you can dig through some stuff.

1152
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Yeah.

1153
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
We did sexual supply month.

1154
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And I did three deployments.

1155
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
I did,

1156
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
1969.

1157
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
I was in,

1158
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Keyloplotoon.

1159
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And then came back from that.

1160
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Then I actually got out for a year and a half.

1161
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Because I was married.

1162
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
And my wife talked me to get now.

1163
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
So I did.

1164
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
And I did work for the phone company as a cable splacer.

1165
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
He did everybody and everything.

1166
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
We lived in Coronado.

1167
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
So I'd go down the trade winds and all my buddies would tell me.

1168
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
What great trips are having and stuff.

1169
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And I just went, you know,

1170
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
What year was that?

1171
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
That was,

1172
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
see,

1173
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
so we said we won.

1174
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
That was going to go back to the 69.

1175
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
So when you got back in 69,

1176
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
you got out for a year and a half.

1177
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Well,

1178
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
about a year,

1179
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
maybe not quite a year and a half.

1180
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
But I went back in and gotten another platoon.

1181
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Luckily,

1182
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
you went to Vietnam again,

1183
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
771.

1184
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And I had.

1185
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Guys like that.

1186
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
That was a great platoon.

1187
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
There was that always out there.

1188
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
You and LPO that, too?

1189
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
No, I was so excited.

1190
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
We were just 60 together getting after.

1191
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Yeah, exactly.

1192
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Yeah.

1193
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
There was that was early difference between that first seal

1194
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
deployment to Vietnam.

1195
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Yeah, I was really happy with the first deployment.

1196
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Because we just didn't do a lot.

1197
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
I mean, it was okay.

1198
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
We did some stuff.

1199
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
But it wasn't my idea of what it should be.

1200
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
You know, it's a seal.

1201
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
You know what I'm saying?

1202
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Oh, yeah.

1203
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And then it was better when I got down to seafood.

1204
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
But it's still, you know,

1205
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
I mean,

1206
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
but that second platoon,

1207
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
that's the one that kept me in the Navy.

1208
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000
You know,

1209
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
they were just,

1210
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:25.000
you know,

1211
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
we're band brothers.

1212
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:27.000
You know,

1213
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
I mean,

1214
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
we were so close.

1215
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I was unbelievable.

1216
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I mean,

1217
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I love those guys.

1218
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
The difference in what you did was

1219
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
the missions that you got tasked with is

1220
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
that the platoon commander kind of set things up

1221
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
so that he had a better vision of what to do and what to get after.

1222
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Absolutely.

1223
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
I was in my second platoon.

1224
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
That guy was just unbelievable.

1225
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
I mean,

1226
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
he was just really really good.

1227
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Our first platoon,

1228
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
it was.

1229
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
He was kind of nuts.

1230
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000
We didn't like him.

1231
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Like one time we're all clean our weapons on seafood.

1232
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
And everything.

1233
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
And what we used to come back when up is gravel line.

1234
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
And then you jump in the water and let it wash all the mud off.

1235
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Yeah.

1236
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Well, he grabbed the line jumped in.

1237
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
We had music roll out and

1238
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
clean our weapons in the shed.

1239
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Well, the line wasn't tied off right.

1240
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
So he just started going on the river.

1241
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
But they saw him in the watch tower and said,

1242
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
man overboard and what he got.

1243
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
You know,

1244
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
something that something that we talk about

1245
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
on here and up some of experience

1246
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
is having blue on blue situations take place.

1247
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Yeah.

1248
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
And it's really hard for people to understand how it happens.

1249
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
But I know that you had,

1250
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
you had one of those happen.

1251
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
You want to kind of give a quick debrief on that.

1252
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Yeah.

1253
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
We're about ready to go home.

1254
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
We had new platoon come in.

1255
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
They wanted to do a break and up,

1256
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
not mentioning names of the officers,

1257
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
but they wanted to do a hammer and a handle off,

1258
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
which you just don't do with a brand new platoon.

1259
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
And would been there,

1260
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:55.000
you know,

1261
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
we had our stuff together pretty well in that area.

1262
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
But what it was was we were supposed to push

1263
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
these bad guys to the VC into these guys that were in a tree line.

1264
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
And they inserted it to the wrong place to start with.

1265
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
So when we started working our way in,

1266
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
we kind of came up to this tree line word ended

1267
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
a rice patty.

1268
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
And then there was another tree line.

1269
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
I couldn't give you the,

1270
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
it was a halfway decent ways away.

1271
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
You know what I'm saying?

1272
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
But we had three kick cars and scouts with us.

1273
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Kick cars and scouts were north of the enemies that had,

1274
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
gave,

1275
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
turned over to the south enemies and they put them in camps.

1276
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And they called them two holy camps,

1277
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
basically.

1278
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
And what we would do is we'd go to these camps.

1279
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And we would get these guys that new our area that we're working in.

1280
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
And through an interpreter and stuff,

1281
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
we'd brief them everything.

1282
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
And they'd come and work with us.

1283
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
And they'd work with us for a couple of offs till they became kind of trusted agents.

1284
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000
And they were pretty good, and most of them were not north enemies.

1285
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
The VC that were good fighters.

1286
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
And then we lived to the,

1287
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
the whole nine yard, we paid them.

1288
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
We had money from now for a baby.

1289
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
They gave us a lot of money to pay these guys and stuff.

1290
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
So they weren't doing it just for free.

1291
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
You know, because they needed money for their families.

1292
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
And I don't know,

1293
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
a toss of these that happened to their families is one of the reasons.

1294
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
They two holy and came to our,

1295
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
to the south enemies side.

1296
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Anyway, we had three of those guys coming out in front of us.

1297
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Blackwood, Jammer's, 1847's.

1298
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Looks just like VC, you know.

1299
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
So the brand new Patoon saw three guys coming out of the tree line that

1300
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
were VC, so they opened up on them.

1301
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
killed two of them and wounded together.

1302
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
And we swung off to the left.

1303
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
And laid down.

1304
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
And they were shooting sections and stoneers that us.

1305
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
But shit was just falling under her heads because they were shooting high.

1306
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Like, you guys generally do before you.

1307
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000
And then it was a pretty new brand new guys in that little tune.

1308
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
You know, they weren't experienced in shit normally.

1309
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
You walk in me and whatever.

1310
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
You know, so we're yelling the radio,

1311
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000
cease fire, cease fire.

1312
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
And we had our officer that was where this got upon his knees.

1313
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
It's you back and then my gun shot through the heart.

1314
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
And we finally got him to stop.

1315
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
And then we got him out of there.

1316
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
He was dead though.

1317
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
He shot right to the heart.

1318
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
You know.

1319
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
That was a blue and blue thing.

1320
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
That was pretty bad.

1321
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
And that was right before you went home.

1322
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Yeah.

1323
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Yeah, the confused that happened to us.

1324
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
It was called a breaking up.

1325
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000
You know, like I say the new that the new platoon had about two guys.

1326
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
I think their LPO can't remember his name.

1327
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000
And then was with me on that beat where we got shot.

1328
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
He was also on my train class.

1329
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000
He was either the OEC or AAC on it.

1330
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
But most of us and we're all brand new guys.

1331
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
You know, I mean, good training.

1332
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Everything, but you know, this is their first song.

1333
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
God damn, we're in a firefight.

1334
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000
You know what I mean?

1335
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Yeah.

1336
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:58.000
We have to be the opportunity to slowly work into the combat situations.

1337
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
You know, do a smaller patrol, do an easier patrol.

1338
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
That's what we normally did.

1339
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Yeah.

1340
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
If you're not kind of overwrite your officers that you got.

1341
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
You know, taking them out in the daytime.

1342
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
That was a daytime off either way.

1343
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000
But usually it's just to kind of get them or in any way to the environment.

1344
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
What they're going to be.

1345
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
And then we all had these.

1346
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
I don't know if we had one in 69, but 771.

1347
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
We had these barn dance files.

1348
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
And every off we went on we put a synopsis in this barn dance.

1349
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000
So if you were going to go in that same area, you could pull out that barn dance file and read it and see what the guys that's seen there.

1350
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Enemy.

1351
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
What the train was like on and on.

1352
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000
You know what I mean?

1353
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Mm-hmm.

1354
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
It was that was pretty good.

1355
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Real good.

1356
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
And almost every platoon had those from previous platoons all the way up to you.

1357
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
So you can kind of get an idea of what you're going into.

1358
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
If you didn't have intel on that area.

1359
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
What are some of the leadership you talked about your second platoon being super tight super close?

1360
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000
What were some of the leadership characteristics that you saw from the platoon chief and the platoon commander that as you look back.

1361
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
You recognize that those were really good traits that really brought everyone together.

1362
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Well, was our chief.

1363
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
He made senior chief.

1364
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
He had been over about three times.

1365
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
And it was just very easy going.

1366
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000
But very sharp and he understood things really well.

1367
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Our LPO was Gary Smith.

1368
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
She just Smith.

1369
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
And he had been a screwdriver in that province.

1370
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000
So as far as getting intel on all of our other sides, it was perfect.

1371
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000
And then, I wouldn't say much about him.

1372
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
But our L.T.

1373
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
He was out.

1374
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
And he went on almost every up.

1375
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000
In fact, one time, he burned his hand with a smoker.

1376
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
And we're still going to go out.

1377
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
He was going to go out with us.

1378
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
He just had his hand wrapped up and shed.

1379
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
So he has over the office club on the Navy side eating.

1380
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000
And the officers send your hands all.

1381
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Benny's up and said, you're still going out.

1382
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
He says, yeah, I think you've buy my guys.

1383
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
I'm dead anyway.

1384
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
But he was really good.

1385
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000
He had his head on his shoulders.

1386
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Figured out things.

1387
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Quick thinker.

1388
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
You know what I mean?

1389
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
And it was just a neat.

1390
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
He was just good.

1391
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
And how about, I mean, you know, we always obviously hear now.

1392
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Veterans get treated great now.

1393
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000
I mean, from the Afghan war in Iraq war, we get treated really great by.

1394
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000
For the most part, by America and by the public, we get treated really well.

1395
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Compared to what you guys had to deal with and Vietnam.

1396
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Well, how much of that did you see when you'd come home?

1397
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Was it, I mean, Coronado is a pretty pro Navy town.

1398
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
I mean, in San Diego, it's a pretty pro Navy town.

1399
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Was it the same way back then?

1400
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Was it relatively pro Navy?

1401
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Or did you see some of the, some of the hippies and whatnot coming on?

1402
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
And it had some demonstrations sometimes.

1403
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
You know what I mean?

1404
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Like downtown San Diego.

1405
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
But not much.

1406
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
And we basically just hung out here in San Diego or to other bars that we knew.

1407
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
We'd fly out on North Island, fly in on North Island.

1408
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
It wasn't like we were flying in the San Francisco or something.

1409
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
So we didn't get hit with that real real heavily.

1410
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
You know what I mean?

1411
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:15.000
And if we did have issues that are bar some of our, we usually skirted away pretty quick.

1412
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000
You know, so it wasn't really a problem.

1413
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
We didn't really our guys here.

1414
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
These ghost guys that don't know, our guys here.

1415
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
We didn't really have everything.

1416
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000
I'll tell you an opto in 69.

1417
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000
We, we're going up this one canal and we used the,

1418
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
PBR's couldn't get up it.

1419
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:45.000
So we had to take a Boston way to wrap it with a twin-six season of front and one guy would set and steer the steer it.

1420
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
You know, we would take a squad up there.

1421
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Maybe five guys, you know, and whatever squad didn't have the opto night,

1422
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
they got to be the driver in the gunner,

1423
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
which I got to be the driver once and I wasn't happy.

1424
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000
I covered myself with flag jackets.

1425
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
I mean, who's anybody going to shoot at?

1426
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Oh yeah.

1427
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000
So we were going up real slow up this thing and all kinds of,

1428
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000
filament lines and stuff like that that were cut in our cell suit.

1429
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Because it was low tide.

1430
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Luckily it wasn't high tide.

1431
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000
You know what I mean?

1432
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Yeah.

1433
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000
So we got up there and, and put the guys in and we came back out in the PBR said,

1434
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
what the boats into a bank right?

1435
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000
So we're sitting there on the PBR me and my buddy that was the gunner, another seal.

1436
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
And I was sitting across this river.

1437
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
We were just pup pup pup pup pup.

1438
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000
It was the sandpan.

1439
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
So we're going to go after it's some bitch.

1440
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:39.000
But one guy driving, one guy in the 60, we need a guy with that could see too.

1441
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000
You know what I mean?

1442
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Because you, you know.

1443
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000
So we asked one of the PBR guys, you know, who wants to go with us.

1444
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000
And this whole time we've been with him and God damn we'd love to go with you guys.

1445
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
The only guy on that boat that volunteered was the guy that was married.

1446
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Yeah.

1447
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000
The rest of wouldn't do it.

1448
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
So we jumped his sandpan.

1449
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
One after the other one, hose them down.

1450
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
They hit the bank.

1451
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000
And then there was blood trails going into the killed one of them.

1452
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
He was laying in the boat and the other guy had gotten out and ran.

1453
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
And he could see blood spots, you know, following them.

1454
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Well, we didn't go after him.

1455
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
We're not that stupid.

1456
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
You know, nighttime.

1457
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
You know, he's probably dying.

1458
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Yeah, I'll take these fuckers.

1459
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Guys out with me.

1460
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Sorry we brought the sandpan back and God damn we had a big thing of intel.

1461
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
And weapons and all kinds of shit.

1462
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
And the other guys that we went up and got the other guys bought them out.

1463
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
They didn't do a thing.

1464
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000
You know, it's pretty neat.

1465
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
That's sketchy.

1466
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Yeah.

1467
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:42.000
I can't imagine the, that you guys would just go buy these filament wires and step over these trip wires

1468
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
and just continue on your mission.

1469
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
That's sketchy.

1470
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Yeah, after.

1471
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
So what you, you know, it's what we did anyway.

1472
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
So I wasn't on this off.

1473
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:57.000
But it was that, you know, a couple of the guys from the other squad went down to square bay.

1474
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000
And we'd gotten this intel that the sandpan pretty good size one.

1475
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Almost like a junk would go up the river at nighttime up the main river where seafood was up by that way.

1476
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
You know, so George and those guys were down there.

1477
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:18.000
They were again, we're in a Boston way, they had a couple of law rockets with them and stuff like that.

1478
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
You know, so they figured we'll shut.

1479
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
We haven't really been a dry hole here.

1480
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000
We had that goddamn, the junk when it comes by, you know.

1481
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
So they go out after the junk and they could hear it and then see the silhouette of it.

1482
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:43.000
You know, so they got real close to it and fires a, fires a law rocket and hit the stern, not the exact rudder and everything.

1483
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Then popped a flare so they could shoot and everything.

1484
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.000
And well, after they popped their flare about 15 other flares popped and it wasn't there us.

1485
00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:01.000
So behind it was all the sort of short-tell of sand pans and shint and so they took off and we're shooting back with their stone or in 60 and stuff like that.

1486
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Finally they called and then a couple of PBRs came down and saved them.

1487
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000
That was a pretty good off.

1488
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
That's, that's just so that's one of the major differences, you know, with us having night vision now.

1489
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000
The way that you guys had to utilize illumination and we did, we did utilize illumination for time at the time.

1490
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000
We actually, on big, big operation sometimes we'd have the army firing of the army.

1491
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Artillery would be firing illumination in certain situations, but generally we weren't doing that.

1492
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Yeah, the damn bushes were always fired a flare up, they ought to get the good vision.

1493
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Yeah, well, we had them. We got out of there.

1494
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000
You know, put a claymores out and claymores behind us.

1495
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000
You know, me and everything sat there and put dudes that come down the river and then we had them.

1496
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:51.000
You know, and then, so you get, you get back from from your second torn view.

1497
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000
And I'm in, is that the warrant, right? I mean, this is pretty much it was.

1498
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000
In fact, a platoon that was that Ben Luck, which was 40 miles away from us.

1499
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
They were only over there for three months and they came back to.

1500
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So we were the last four to point deployed platoon in Vietnam.

1501
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
There was no member platoon.

1502
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Was it Chief, like he said, a sponge a great guy's not platoon?

1503
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
In, in, I mean, at that time there was a couple hundred guys at Silti-1.

1504
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I think there was about maybe, and it boosted up real high.

1505
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
So there might have been 250.

1506
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I think there was only about 150 when I got into the,

1507
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I don't know, if the big push had started yet to build more guys up.

1508
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
It wasn't a lot. You knew everybody.

1509
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I mean, it was a pretty tight, tight group.

1510
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
You want to get one guy that we both know, he told me when he checked in the Silti-1 back then.

1511
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
He was like taking a shower after PT and like every guy was shot up.

1512
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Like you could just see what every guy was, you know, you could see scars and they're armed,

1513
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
leg, swoomed in.

1514
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Did you, did you, did you, what a lot of guys stay in it at that time?

1515
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
A lot of guys do a couple of tunes.

1516
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I think after the, no, most of the guy stayed in, that's what we did.

1517
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
That's what we loved. And then after the war, yeah, we had a pretty good,

1518
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
access to some people getting out.

1519
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And when they get out because there was nothing to do, you know,

1520
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that's what they were doing. That was there, you know, there's nothing else.

1521
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I mean, what are you going to do, you know,

1522
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and I think in, because I just like the guys, I like all we did, you know,

1523
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:32.000
when I was over at Buds, I come back in 1971 and then went over to Buds as an instructor.

1524
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
And I got bored doing that. So there was this guy called,

1525
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I'll tell you, I would not want to be a student when you are bored as a Buds instructor.

1526
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I was a nice guy there.

1527
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Anyway, so, I went, buddy, Doll was in UDT,

1528
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
he's a little bit of guy from Colorado and he was a rodeo rider, right?

1529
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
So he talks me in the going out this place called Burton,

1530
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000
which is out by, wasn't like sign. It was Lemon Valley,

1531
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Lemon Grove. Lemon Grove. Yeah. And there was a place called Burton's out there.

1532
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And it was just all bulls, but they were dinks. They weren't real.

1533
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
You rode your bulls, you know. So I went out there and,

1534
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
hell, I liked it. Never got bucked off there. So I went rodeo and went to IRA

1535
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and PRCA.

1536
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And actually thought about getting out of the Navy to ride rodeo because I loved it.

1537
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
But then I got bored because rodeo bulls are, I rode bulls.

1538
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
They're the last of the event, right?

1539
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Yeah.

1540
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So I started riding Bearback in South of Orange.

1541
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:42.000
But I got stepped on, well, I got 22 stitches in my left side of my face,

1542
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
14 in the back of my head, and had both my shoulders dislocated.

1543
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
When it was a god-goard, then I got stepped on and had five buss,

1544
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
the ribs and punctured along. So I figured, okay, that's enough.

1545
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I quit doing that and just ate in the teams, you know.

1546
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
The teams are safe for the rodeo ride.

1547
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Yeah, that was over over a year and a half, almost two years.

1548
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Yeah.

1549
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Yeah.

1550
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
What about guys? I mean, how were guys doing as far as handling what they've seen

1551
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and coming back and all of a sudden they're in Main Street?

1552
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Dude, we didn't have that problem.

1553
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I mean, I'm telling you, the guys that were crazy were crazy before they went on.

1554
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I didn't see that.

1555
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
They weren't, I mean, I know all my buddies and in fact,

1556
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Thursday, this Thursday night, we have that UDT, Vietnam UDT seal,

1557
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
get together and Thursday night talk those guys.

1558
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
You don't see, but you know, I've got to go to the hospital and mentally owned.

1559
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Not that I know if I tell you.

1560
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
There may be, it did happen, but the only guy I know that really got affected

1561
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
was he was with that one platoon.

1562
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I can't think of him.

1563
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And they were taking a part of Mortar in the mortar blew up.

1564
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And he had just left to have a cigarette and all his buddies got killed by that Mortar

1565
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and stuff including the guy named who was just a superb guy.

1566
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
And he wasn't quite the same after that.

1567
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And I can understand that.

1568
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I mean, not, you know what I mean?

1569
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
But just being the firefights and shit like that and stuff that happened.

1570
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
But you know, we just, it was the way I was.

1571
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And even when you, even when you got out for the first, so then you did,

1572
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
you did 30 years in the Navy.

1573
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And you know, that was another funny thing when you, when I talked about earlier

1574
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
when you, when you graded our, you laying graded me for the first time.

1575
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I don't know how old you were.

1576
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
It was 1993, maybe 1993 or you.

1577
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I was in, uh, alfoutoon at team one with, uh,

1578
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
and I'm going to, yeah, I was a good off.

1579
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Yeah, but you were, I don't know how old you were in that time period.

1580
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
But, you know, for, for my perspective, you were like 170 years old, right?

1581
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Yeah, yeah.

1582
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And I'm thinking about yourself, hey, this guy's deal.

1583
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
This is this Roger Aden.

1584
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And you're like putting on your wetsuit.

1585
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Okay, put on the wetsuit.

1586
01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I guess you're going to get in the water.

1587
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Get some water, swim in.

1588
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Do the recolbs.

1589
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I'm in with the recolon and then he swim back out.

1590
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Swim back out, you know?

1591
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
That was a good job.

1592
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That was such a good job to do.

1593
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
If you're going to do orange, you've got to do them right.

1594
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
You know, old pointy to point me.

1595
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Otherwise, you don't see everything, you know?

1596
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And that's what I liked.

1597
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I was a warrant in.

1598
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
But that's what I liked my last three or four years, three years,

1599
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I think, in the, in the teams as I did a orange.

1600
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
So you still got to have your feet on the ground of the boys, you know?

1601
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It couldn't be an opportunity.

1602
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
But that's what I wanted to do.

1603
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yeah, there's nothing, there's nothing better than, uh,

1604
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
there's nothing better than the, uh, than the putoon life.

1605
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Now, I know that I know that you're short on time, and I,

1606
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
and I, I rushed this and, uh,

1607
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I'm glad we were able to get a little bit done.

1608
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And I think maybe after after this one,

1609
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
we need to listen to it and, and I'll probably end up with a bunch more questions.

1610
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I know people that are listening to this,

1611
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
a bunch of team guys listening to this.

1612
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
They, they actually, a bunch of team guys sent me a bunch of questions.

1613
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I didn't get to any of them.

1614
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah, we were, yeah, I know it's a, I'm sorry.

1615
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
No, it's all good.

1616
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
It's all good. Yeah, things that pop up in your head when you talk about it.

1617
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I mean, I mean, there's a lot of, I mean, I was a,

1618
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I was a frogman first, and they'll see, you know, see that.

1619
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Yeah, that was probably one of the best appointments ever had.

1620
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And that was great.

1621
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And Philopines is great.

1622
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And we were so glad to leave the Philopines and go back to the depth,

1623
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
just to get out of for a while, that he died, you know?

1624
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So, uh,

1625
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
we'll definitely get you back on here.

1626
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
And like I said, next time I'll, I'll, I'll get some questions from the team,

1627
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
guys that, that they asked me to ask you and go through some of those.

1628
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
But, thanks for coming on.

1629
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I know like I said, I know you've never, never been out in the public eye before.

1630
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And that's just the, the epitome of a quiet professional that, that we were all raised on.

1631
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And I appreciate it.

1632
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Like I said, you're a hero mine.

1633
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
You're a hero with the seal teams and you're really a hero to everybody in this, in this country.

1634
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:05.000

Or to make that part easier, we have this, the trooper tool.

So you don't have to remember it's good.

1653
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Also, if you like the shirts that we have, well, that's the ones discipline equals freedom.

1654
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
It's a good one.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But yeah, I get some of those.

1656
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
That's how you can support.

1657
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Awesome.

1658
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And you can get the book that latefabbin and I wrote that actually Roger did the security clearance on.

1659
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I just reviewed it for you.

1660
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
For you to think, you know what I mean?

1661
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah, for me to think.

1662
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
But one thing I will say, you know, I don't think I'm a hero.

1663
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm going to go over and then did my job had a lot of fun.

1664
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
This was a great guy.

1665
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
You know, that's money.

1666
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Well, that's one of the things that makes you hero.

1667
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And thanks.

1668
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Thanks for coming on the show.

1669
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And also, if you don't know, we're having a little,

1670
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000
little conference out here in San Diego, California, October 20th and 21st.

1671
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It's not going to be for everybody.

1672
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
But if you want to get in the game, if you want to do something that's going to be intense to focus.

1673
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
You want to talk about leadership.

1674
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
We're going to talk about getting better at what we do.

1675
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Come on out the master October 20th and 21st.

1676
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Roger, thanks again for coming on the show.

1677
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Thanks for everything you did.

1678
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Serving this country in Vietnam and spending the rest of your life.

1679
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Supporting the seal teams dedicated to our country.

1680
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And like I said, Roger is kind of an unknown veteran.

1681
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And I would like to take a moment to thank all the Vietnam veterans that fought with courage and with honor in a hard war,

1682
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
in an unpopular war.

1683
01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And not only fought for freedom against the evils of communism,

1684
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000
but also a established and passed on lessons learned for the current generation of war fighters.

1685
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:18.000
We owe all of you a great debt of gratitude for what you did for us and for the United States of America.

1686
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000
And everyone else out there, thanks for listening, thanks for spreading the word.

1687
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:34.000
And as you go through life, remember the sacrifice of these veterans that fought and sacrificed for us,

1688
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:46.000
so that we can live with the sacred freedom to go out into the world and get after it.

1689
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:54.000
So until next time, this is echo and jacco, right in this true hero,

1690
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:02.000
worn officer, chief worn officer, seal, retired, Roger,

1691
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
out.
