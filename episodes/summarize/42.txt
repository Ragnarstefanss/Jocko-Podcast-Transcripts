He was like actually surprised like when you finally told me you know you like man, you know I was kind of thought you might not like me, you know because You know smaller and and You know I don't look like a seal and then he and I turned out to be good friends, but I remember we're out doing land warfare training and this is like where you know you're cutting the metal like you said You're getting to know each other and you know the guys in the platoon Also trying to figure out what these new guys like all right, what have I what have we got here? it's a way light-hearted question compared to let's go So when you go into the mortgage industry, yeah, and you know there's other people in the office as well Like what did they think about did they know you know you're you're you're past they find out you know, but it's hard to right because in the seal teams we have We have a quiet Professionalism and so one of the things that I've struggled with is you know And you know for us and for those of you don't know see you go through a work up prior going on deployment Which is now you're working together for the first time this is when I'm getting to know you guys You guys are getting to know me we're all getting to know each other where the whole the whole unit is coming together as a team So the laser him and you if you see the video like like you hear guys going like guys are witnessing like nobody's been T-he's like nobody else was gonna happen right now, Yeah, whereas like guys I mean that would be a massive miscalculation You know like really end of life event extinction my event kind of decision To be not to counter I know exactly what you're saying but like The facts are people don't mess with me when I'm out in public. yeah, those are these are helpful men because Yeah, like if they're like hey jacco stop saying like like all the time No, I don't say like right and I talked about this too for those of you are on the podcast You can't you know that are listening and you doesn't look like stereotypical seal He's a hundred and fifty five pounds He's what it how tall are you five seven five seven Susan look he's not your stereotypical seal looking guy now again that the public with that the public with things I guys gonna say There's no stereotype and some of the most badass guys are there every size But this is something that Andrew said to me one time which was You know So I go back in there and I go in and glow for Mikey's palace I go back in there and we just said Hey man you want some of these have beef jerky that's so does he'd have like romans romony rules and he'd always had He had like this heating element like once like you plug into the wall He'd like hey man I know what he's doing I know he's making this isn't let me explain this down the chain of command That's right and that's so helpful and so helpful and when you got guys in the puttune or any organization a high performing organization That are really strong-willed and have strong opinions and by the way are an intelligent and it can make really Articular points as to why they don't agree with something You know again my role in that in that situation Was to ensure that mission success continued to happen that we were still effective as a unit and that meant me Kind of behind the scenes trying to keep keep some guys on board. so That's life Charlie Platoon and when he was on that first podcast We talked about a bunch of things, but one of the main focuses of our conversation was Some of the brothers that we lost Mark Lee who is the first seal killed in Iraq We talked about big holes Ryan Job Who was gravely wounded in Ramadi and who later died after complications From a surgery to repair those wounds then finally we talked about Chris Kyle who Was also in Charlie Platoon was the lead sniper and point man and who ended up writing the book American sniper Which was you know turned into a very successful movie and Chris as you know Was senselessly murdered as he tried to help out a fellow veteran and On that podcast we didn't talk in any depth at all about Mikey Montsour Who is another one of our brother seals from task unit bruiser Who's also killed in Ramadi and if you don't know Mikey was posh and was the award at the Medal of Honor after he Smothered a grenade with his body in order to save three of our other teammates And one of the reasons I didn't want to focus on Mikey during that podcast is because Mike he was in Delta, but to As opposed to Charlie Ptun Charlie's two Patoons in the task unit Charlie and Delta and Charlie was Life was the Patoon commander and Tony a Friday who was on the podcast as well. So so Any is there anything else again without without going into Your personal You know your personal interactions with this incredible family That you want to say and maybe from the perspective of As much as I hate to say this there's gonna be other people that are gonna do this job Being this person that does the notification Is there anything else that you could give advice to people that have to do this job or you know If they if that ever be falls people that I mean we get a lot Andrew we get a lot of big lot of military guys that that reach out to me all the time that are active duty that are doing it up to work or you know, so he was just you know, you know kind of like hopped to or whatever in a very I don't want to make that sound too extreme, you know, but he was surprised to see the command oh and I'm gonna tell you what like it had these like two modes And one where you could shoot or you could like put it right up to the guy You know It's kind of like getting the band back together You know, and those and look those two guys had just come off of Not the greatest deployments either in terms of a junior officer seal right because they were deployed and they were the Assistant commanders And they were getting stuck with not so fun work, you know, so that we were stoked to be all right They were so close. I get the brief and figure out who it is So Start figuring out okay, so now it's now it's a race for those of you that don't know I mean look here's a thing We live in a 24 seven news world and it's a race to notify the family before they find out for some other means and He lives up in Orange County so we started assembling a team and you know Admirals and Commodore's are involved and It look This is the second guy that we have not lost seals on our act to this point mark and Mike now so um You know, it's who's gonna go to the notification Yeah, I'm here to check in like Like the all-seeing I just like Glances like you said what I'll so I'm checking into Buds Wearing that I'm like maybe I should go put in for money.
