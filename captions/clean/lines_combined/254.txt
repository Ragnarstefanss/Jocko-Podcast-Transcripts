00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 254 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening echo. Good evening and joining us again is Dave Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening. Last few podcasts, 251 with lifebat and 252, 253 also with Dave Burke. We've been making our way through the book.
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000 Guidelines for the leader and commander which I brought my actual sacred real copy, not just the photocopies, so Dave could lay eyes on it.
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:46.000 And we're approaching the halfway point. We should get to the halfway point today, no promises, because this book is dense. There's all kinds of stuff to unpack.
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000 This is the root of the book that taught me the most about leadership, about face, by Colonel David Hackworth.
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000 Hackworth references this book multiple times in about face.
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000 So the book is Guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Carter. Bruce Clark World War I World War II, Korea.
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000 Distinguished Service Cross, three silver stars, 45 years of service as a leader and a trainer in the army.
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000 Plenty less than a learner and we're learning them. We are learning them. So let's get into it chapter eight.
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000 Philosophy is in principles of training in overseas areas. This is a whole section on how do you train when you're deployed?
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000 Section one, the training task, the missions.
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000 The primary mission of all US military forces is to deter communist aggression and if deterrence fails to defeat aggression when and where it occurs.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000 So sometimes I work with companies and they want to have a mission statement.
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000 There's a good example of a mission statement. That's what you're trying to do.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000 This is what you can make so many decisions based on that kind of mission statement.
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000 What your job is, why do we exist?
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000 You ever thought about that one? Why do I exist? What am I here for?
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000 You ever think about that, echo Charles? Yes. You think yourself I'm here too?
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000 I haven't come out with answer yet. We're working it. Make some video on it.
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000 Pressure court, apparently.
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000 Check. The mission of the United States Army in overseas in overseas areas stem logically from this broad US forces mission.
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000 Our first mission is to ensure the readiness of US Army forces to defeat communist aggression and overseas theaters.
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000 In doing so, we contribute most effectively to the accomplishment of our deterrence mission.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000 Additionally, we have the mission to support US contingency operations in peripheral areas.
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000 The Lebanon and Congo operations are examples in of such contingencies.
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000 These missions require that all US Army personnel and units instantly be ready to undertake combat operations.
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000 This requirement provides the basis for all overseas training objectives which are presented and discussed in the following paragraph.
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000 So, here's what I think you find in organizations.
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000 That really nice kind of clean thing gets put out to the troops.
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000 Then the troops start to do their job and they start to live their lives and they lose track of this.
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000 It can happen to an organization. It can happen to you as a human being.
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000 You kind of forget where you're going. You forget what you're trying to do.
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000 You forget what the team is here for. You forget what the mission is.
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000 Can't let that happen. Got to think about that stuff.
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000 So easy to veer off of course. So easy just to get off course a little bit.
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000 Have you ever seen you must've seen this?
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000 Go for one. Go for one.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000 I'm almost positive helicopters are holding station.
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000 They're holding station. There's a blue envelope and they end up shooting an APC.
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000 I want to see if it wasn't a Bradley.
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000 I know what you're talking about. It's a friendly position.
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000 I thought it might even have been marine L.A.Vs. Maybe I'm right.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000 But it's a lightly American vehicle.
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000 Yep.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000 And you can hear it. It's one of the most horrific things to listen to.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000 But what happens is these helicopters are in position and there's just a little bit of a cross breeze.
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000 Just a little bit of a cross breeze.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000 And so they don't really recognize it because they're just slowly getting blown off of their where they're supposed to be.
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000 And guess what? There's multiple helicopters. They're all getting blown off.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000 So the relative to the other helicopters they're in position.
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000 And it's the open desert. And it's hard to tell where you are in the open desert.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000 There's no real often times there's no real clean reference points. Oh, there's the mountain with the little peak next to it.
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000 Or there's the river or whatever. Those things don't exist. Just big flat open.
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000 So these guys drift and the next thing you know they're calling in. Hey, we see an armored vehicle.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000 Well, there should be no armored vehicles in your area.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000 Well, are you sure? Yeah, we're sure. You should engage that.
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000 And not only do they engage the vehicle.
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000 Some of the guys get out of the vehicle. They engage the guys that get out. It's absolutely.
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000 It's a it's a it's a complete nightmare. And here's the really crazy thing.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000 When once that call goes down and the pilot realizes what he did.
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000 And he says something like you can hear in his voice. He's going to throw up. He's just absolutely sick to his stomach.
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000 And he says, you know, can we return to base? We just we just we just engage our friendly troops and whoever's the air mission commander is that's right term.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000 I guess is the air mission commander says, you know, negative go back to station and hold for you know enemy vehicles.
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000 That's what, you know, you tell your job.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000 But what an example of little slow drift off course with catastrophic results.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000 That can happen when we lose sight of what our mission is.
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000 Back to the book objectives of training. In order to ensure effective accomplishment of a sign combat operational contingency and peace time operation missions.
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000 The training goal of US forces overseas is to maintain all units and headquarters of the high command and a state of combat readiness.
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000 This goal is equally applicable to combat combat support technical and administrative type units.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000 And it is attained through careful attention to the following seven specific training objectives.
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:59.000 So, you know, you're in an organization. And we always think of whatever the critical mode, the critical piece of that organization is.
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000 Whether it's the frontline salesperson, whether it's the frontline infantrymen.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:18.000 Whoever's making the actual, you know, hand-to-hand combat, who's doing the work. We always focus on them and he's laying out everybody else combat support technical administrative type units.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000 Everyone's important and they all have to be trained with this mission in mind.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000 So here's the objectives.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000 One maintain the proficiency of the individual soldier. That's number one.
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000 Proficiency of the individual soldiers number one.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:49.000 Number two, develop a high degree of responsibility and resourcefulness in the commanders and key personnel, both officers and non-commission officers of all units.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:09.000 And one thing, as I continue to read through this book, you can sense there is there are threads. There is remaining DNA of World War I of centralized command of obedience.
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000 And you can feel some of that in there. And you can also feel the rejection of that.
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000 And so that's why when he says things like, hey, it's responsibility and resourcefulness.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000 Right, you, this is to, you know, we need our subordinate units to take ownership. We need our subordinate officers to take ownership and figure out how to do things.
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000 That's what, at the number two, look, we want our soldiers to be proficient. Number two, we want our leaders to be resourceful and to take ownership.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:50.000 Number three, achieve on a continuing and progressive basis, the effective integration of new weapons equipment, new organization and new techniques at all levels of command.
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000 Learning is what the Marine Corps came out with that manual. How legit was that?
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000 I mean, he's basically saying, you need to figure that you need to invent it, adapt, you need to figure this out.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000 And by the way, continuing progressive basis, when does that end? Oh, that's right. It doesn't end.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000 Continuing progressive basis doesn't end. Next, maintain an effective fighting team of the combined arms and supporting units,
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:28.000 maintain an effective integrated team of the branches and services we do work together. And, and, so, so combined arms.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:37.000 What is combined arms? Combine arms is the use of multiple different weapons platforms, all in conjunction to support each other.
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:48.000 It's the sort of the highest form of cover move, right? Because we got aircraft in the sky that are covering the tanks as they move in, the tanks are covering for infantry.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:00.000 The infantry are also covering the tanks, actually, artillery covering all people. So this is combined arms. It's all these elements covering and moving for each other.
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:09.000 What I miss on that. The piece to that, too, you got to write is, is the intent that you're sooner or later, the enemy is going to have to respond to something.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000 And when they respond to the tanks, that freeze up the infantry, they respond to the aircraft, that freeze up the tanks, whatever it is.
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000 And the beauty of that is that, all these different things you're bringing to bear, I don't care which one is the one that ends up closing the deal.
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000 I don't care if it's the tanks that take the final shot of the aircraft. We don't care. We're going to work together.
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000 We're going to create a problem for the enemy that they cannot handle. They got a thick one and they're going to lose to the other. And I don't care which one it is.
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:42.000 And this brings forth, this brings forth one of my favorite doctrinal terms of all time, which is, it's the equivalent of checkmate,
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000 which is, we are going to capture the enemy in the combined arms dilemma.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.000 Meaning there is no escape. Here you are going to do it killed by the infantry, by the air, by the artillery, by armor.
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000 We have you. You're in checkmate. That is the combined arms dilemma where we have you.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000 One of my favorite doctrinal terms.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:19.000 That put a smile on my face for the day. Also, it talks about, I already said this one, but maintain an effective integrated team of the branches and services of yes army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, all need to work together.
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000 Develop a high degree of competence in combined and joint operations at once again. It's interesting teamwork teamwork teamer.
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000 All the last three of these are all about working together.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:43.000 And was the last one developed coordination techniques for the effective accomplishment of inter-allied operations. So it's teamwork. It's out of the seven four of them are about teamwork.
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000 We have to learn how to work together. Understanding the cycles of training.
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:56.000 Combat readiness is the joint joining of well trained men with properly maintained equipment in an organized unit of high-esprit.
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:05.000 The first requirement is that the men of this unit be trained as individuals and as a team to carry out their combat jobs with thoroughness and speed.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000 This task surpasses all others for the commander overseas.
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.000 That type of clarity. Once again, if you're a commander on the ground and you're looking at, hey, what's my priority? There you go.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:30.000 This task surpasses all others for commanders overseas. It's to make sure that guys are trained, individuals to work as a team to carry out their jobs.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000 That's the most important thing. Readiness training is therefore the first priority task of every such unit commander.
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000 Within the concept of readiness training each commander will be required to plan cycles or phases of training to meet varying situations and requirements.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:55.000 The most conspicuous of which is an annual loss of approximately 50% of his personnel who will be replaced by soldiers of varying levels of training and service.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:06.000 And look, the whole time I'm reading this book and you and I had a funny conversation when I started sending you pictures of texts of like little sections of the book and you eventually sent me a text to just cover the whole thing.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000 And I'm like, I will, but there's parts of it where I got, you know what, that's not 100% applicable or I'm not really sure how that ties in. And sometimes there's some point points we get to a level of detail.
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:35.000 What I found so interesting why wanted to read this is there's not too many, you know, when you hear when you talk civilian companies they're thinking, oh well, you know, in the army you've got these guys and they're trained and they're selected and everyone's got this baseline of training.
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:44.000 Well, guess what, you're also losing 50% of your people annually. They're just cycling out there either getting out and this isn't even talking, what time this is just like life people move on.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:59.000 So you're constantly in this struggle to train and maintain efficiency and every time you train someone, every for every person you train one of those one of those people that you train leaves one out of every two people that you train leaves.
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:16.000 Which is, which makes it a hard job. What do you got? I'm already coming back to the very first thing you said, which is, you said the word clarity, I think a couple times now and just hearing that mission statement of what we do.
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:30.000 The amount of clarity in his first comment, here's our mission, we're here to turn out to me if we don't, we're going to fight them and kill them. That's our mission. And the very next thing he says is, everybody else's role is to train to be prepared to do that.
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:49.000 That actually sounds really simple, but it's really hard to create a message that's that clear. So by which the infantryman and the person who's running administration, who seem like completely different, have clarity in how what they do contributes to the overall mission.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:01.000 That is not easy to do and this idea of communicating in a simple, clear, concise manner to talk all the time. It's really hard, but from the very beginning he's like, hey, this is the mission. Here are seven things that we're going to do to allow that to happen.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:15.000 So morning commanders, your job is to make it happen. So he's tying all these things together and it sounds so simple when I'm hearing him say, but I'm realizing how hard that actually is in an organization to get everybody to understand what it is they do to contribute.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000 If you can make your administrative folks feel like they are war fighters, you have a clear mission statement.
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:35.000 Yeah. I imagine that I have no idea how many troops he's talking to. It's not going to overseas American troops. This is millions of, yeah, maybe not millions, but this is hundreds and hundreds of thousands of troops.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:48.000 This continual turnover of personnel precludes commanders from programming a single training cycle common to all men as employed in a basic training center. It requires a programming of a number of successive cycles which may overlap to some degree.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:16:01.000 And at times may operate concurrently during any 12 month period the commander will need to place emphasis on the following cycles of training. So again, he's just emphasizing the fact that you're going to lose people, you're going to lose them all the time.
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:12.000 And that's going to make your job hard. Here's the things that you need to focus on advanced individual training to improve the proficiency of minimum service soldiers or to provide refresher training from man of longer service.
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:30.000 So you've got to just train individuals basic unit training to improve the proficiency of crews teams and squads advanced unit training to integrate teams cruise and squads into small units combined arms training to integrate infantry armor artillery engineer and other supporting units into company and battalion.
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:40.000 Group exercises and then combat mission training to include readiness tests, rehearsals of operational plans and joint combined training. So that's what you're doing.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:50.000 He's saying that same thing over and over again. You've got to train the individual, then you've got to train that next level team, then you've got to integrate them with the other teams, then you've got to get all those teams working together.
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000 Very good way to think about how you train in any organization you're in.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.000 Next, the need to maintain a high level combat readiness without peaks and valleys of proficiency prevents the commander from concentrating for long on any cycle before going into the next.
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000 This is not to imply that a unit must perform all five cycles at one time.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:23.000 It does mean that the commander must elevate continually the level of proficiency of his man and unit in each of these five phases of training based on this evaluation he plans his training program.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:36.000 Ideally, the commander assesses the proficiency of each soldier in all five cycles and organized his training so that individuals and the unit as a whole progress systematically through all cycles and he goes on to explain this.
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:50.000 And what I like about this is how often with whatever organization you're in or whatever organization you're leading, do you actually think in a holistic way, comprehensively about the methodology that you're using to train your people.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000 The answer is probably not great.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:06.000 So if we don't have even a goal of what good looks like, if we haven't written down what good looks like, how are we possibly going to get there.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:15.000 Going ahead a little bit, based balancing unit and activities, the training for combat readiness is not the only mission of the commander.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:29.000 And we must also make adequate provisions for the supply and maintenance of the unit equipment administration and discipline, community relations program, troop morale and welfare programs and the all these activities demand their share of resources time and emphasis.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000 So not only do you have to train people combat, that's great, that's your normal one priority, he already said that.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:42.000 You also got all these other things that you need to handle, which by the way is the same in any organization, any organization that you're in, guess what, you got to take care of the families.
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:52.000 You got to make sure that your guys are healthy, you got to make sure that they've got something to distract their mind and keep them occupied.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:01.000 Continuing on, the immediate day-to-day pressures of these additional functions result in a tendency to emphasize them at the expense of combat readiness needs.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000 So all of a sudden, he just went from like, look, you got to take care of those other things, you got to get it.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000 It's like the, it's like when someone goes, you know, I just read.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000 You are read, I read in that fitness magazine that you know, rest is even more important than working out.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:27.000 You know what I'm saying? And all of a sudden that becomes the prevailing mode is rest.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000 Yes, you know what I'm talking about, I do know what you're talking about.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000 Yeah, that chuckle.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000 Yeah, we hear of you're looking at me.
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000 Can you ever, can you ever call yourself in that combined arms dilemma?
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000 No.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000 Where you were kind of like, well, you know, rest is important.
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000 Important.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000 Yes, I have in a way, but in this way, which might even kind of apply to this in, as far as a concept goes.
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000 Could you use that as the example?
00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000 If I'm working out, or if I don't feel like working out, and I'm like, well, I did work up pretty hard yesterday.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000 And rest is important, rationalizing.
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000 Maybe I should rest. It's not like this rest today will hurt me.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000 If anything, it'll help me.
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000 Right. Yeah, a little bit complicated kind of question or statement.
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000 I get it, but I'm just saying it's kind of the same thing where you have that starts to become the,
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000 because for that moment, it was the prevailing thing.
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000 Got it.
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000 So we have to make sure that we provide ample room for rest and recovery.
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000 Yes, sir.
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000 But we can't let that become the prevailing mode of operating.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000 Which, let's face it.
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000 What do people gravitate towards?
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000 People like to gravitate towards that couch.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000 Yeah, but comfort.
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000 The fun part.
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000 The unit commander must recognize that even after the elimination of nice to have activities,
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000 necessary functions remain, which cannot be fully executed within the resources available to him.
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000 His only resources to do first things.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000 And I got a question like that today talking to a client.
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000 What do we do when we resource constrained?
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000 What do we do when we don't have the manpower?
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000 It's like, oh, cool. Yeah, we already talked about this.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000 You may talk about prioritizing actually earlier.
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000 Yeah, that's what we're talking about.
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000 That's what it is. Prioritize next cut.
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000 It's interesting too.
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000 I used to use this quote.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000 And when I was talking to clients, I'd say,
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000 there's no organization in the world that has unlimited resources.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000 We've worked with some companies now that come pretty damn close to unlimited at least financial resources.
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000 They have, for all practical purposes on limited resources,
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000 the problem is the problem becomes human capital.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000 Right?
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000 You can only get you.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000 There's only so many people in existence that have a certain job scale have a certain capability.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000 And so that becomes a limiting factor.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:00.000 So even with a company that has more money than they can spend.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000 They can throw all kinds of money at whatever problem they have.
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000 But they're limited by their limited by human resources.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000 And you can even, when you say, look, we can pay, we can pay, you know,
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000 however many people are million dollars a year.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000 Those people just do not exist.
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000 And so there is, I've had to modify that a little bit.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000 But the statement remains true.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000 There's no organization in the world that has unlimited resources.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000 Everyone has limited resources.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000 Everyone, every company, the biggest companies in the world have limited resources.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000 That's all there is to it.
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000 And so what do you always have to do?
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000 You always have to prioritize next cut.
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000 He must go.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000 What he's, there's a part that I think he's also getting at two.
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000 If you understand what that, what that number one priority is.
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000 Those other things he talked about and he kind of did kind of the classic dichotomy.
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000 This is important.
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000 But yeah.
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000 He also understands that all those things those morale welfare recreation types things.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.000 What they're actually designed to do is when we need to come back to that priority.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000 And then we need to surge for that most important thing.
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000 Investing of that is actually the best way to have your guys have the energy to observe themselves even more.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000 I'm kind of thinking about it like surge operations or thinking about, you know,
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000 when I'm on a deployment, we're supposed to go for six months and we get the,
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000 we get the notification four and a half months into it.
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000 You're getting extended for six weeks.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000 And this six month deployment is not going to be closer to eight months.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000 If you've made that investment in your family and they are all in because you've demonstrated that you care about them.
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000 So six extra six weeks, it's no factor.
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000 But when you, you forsake all these are the things and don't recognize that those things are important.
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000 It's really hard to get anything extra out of your guys.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000 And this is a guy who's obviously has experience with we're going to have to observe ourselves at some point.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000 And when that time comes, hey, weekends at home with the family, those things aren't going to happen.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000 And the way for that to happen is to invest in that when you can, when you have the time and resource to do it,
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000 knowing that it's going to actually come back to the thing that matters the most, which is you go into your job.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000 Yeah, it's it's a great correlation to the rest in recovery that we're talking for physical work you know.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000 If you've got time, you need to rest because there's going to be a time where there's not going to be rest.
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000 And you're going to get you're going to catch a beat down.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000 So that's the way it's going to happen.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000 Continue on. He must analyze his mission and determine the relative priority and degree of.
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000 Interdependence of the function to central the mission of compliment based on these considerations.
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000 He must develop a program of unit activities which provides a balanced distribution of resources amongst these functions.
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:59.000 So yes, you got to take care of your people to plan such a balanced program, a commander must first survey his many tasks in total.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000 T O T O you think I looked that word up?
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000 Yeah, I think he did.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000 I sure did. Yeah, and it's a word.
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000 It means everything means just what it sounds like. It means everything completely. So you got to look at everything.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000 And then you can do a little prioritize next here.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:24.000 And then having made a complete list listing of appropriate to his command, the commander should analyze the proportion of hours and manpower being given to each activity.
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000 One method is to calculate the man hours to vote at each activity as a percentage of total man hours available to the units.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000 A continuous realistic appraisal of the units man hours is an essential part of command.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:52.000 When the commander feels that an imbalance exists and that the accomplishment of his mission is there by threaten he must take positive aggressive action to rectify the situation when he is exhausted all means at his disposal without correcting the imbalance then he should seek assistance from his higher commander.
00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:07.000 That little trick, I'll call it a trick of man hours, that little trick of when people say, we can't get this done and you go, oh, how many man hours will it take to get this done?
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:16.000 You ask that question because a lot of times they just looked at the task and made a gut decision.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:29.000 But the problem with that gut decision is they could be right, but it doesn't help you because you have no you have nowhere to go because if echo if I say hey echo how long is going to take you to pour you know to build this block wall.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:39.000 And you say, I can't get it done, I don't have it's going to take way too long, okay, well, how long is it going to take how long would it take one man to do it, but just you by yourself it did go week okay.
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:50.000 So that's 40 hours, what if I give you three more people could you know him saying so digging in a little bit and figuring out how long it takes to do something.
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000 That's the data that you need.
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000 He's also telling you don't go back to your boss complaint.
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:03.000 If you're at a resource show me information hey boss hey listen you need to get this done to take sex amount of time I can't get this done on time.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000 That's a totally different thing than jocca do that can't do this man this too hard it's too much work don't go to your boss in complaint.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:18.000 If you don't have what you need no factor we can address that but we can only address that if you actually come back to me with something that's solvable other than this is too big of a problem for me.
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:28.000 Yeah, that that is really what it is it's like it's it's too big of a problem then I'm in the mood for it's like that kind of situation because you do this all the time even on a small level.
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000 You'll start asking those questions like well, well, you know and then.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000 Where are you real vague here?
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000 I know but I can't really think of anything that just gave me that feeling right when you when you said hey how long is this concrete all going to take.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000 I was like I know that feeling.
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000 And I see what you're doing because you're like hey we like this is a problem that needs to be solved to me.
00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:04.000 And you put some task on me that it's like, well, that's just your idea like let's think so instead instead of like okay let's think through the whole thing really to understand what it takes to do it.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:14.000 You know that that process exists no matter how big and how small me I just see how big it is or estimate how big it is and I'm like, I'm really not on the mood for this right now you know.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000 And then you just get to the bottom of it so it's kind of like undeniably doable.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000 I got to do this thing then I don't really.
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:31.000 Yeah there's a there's a surface level way of looking at things and just seeing like what's on the surface and going hey.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000 You know you see the tip of an iceberg and you go look that iceberg huge.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000 I can't I can't handle that whole iceberg this too it's too big.
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000 Well let's get a snorkel and mask and look underwater and see how much ice is down there that we got to chip away.
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000 Yeah that can be done.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000 Yeah and I kind of boxed you in some time.
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:58.000 Oh yeah big time even that an out of your right there the iceberg like I see it you're like okay that's a tip of the iceberg we know that iceberg is big to me.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:07.000 I'm like yeah I don't deal with big icebergs next like this move on and you're like okay it's big but you know there's more to it than that I'm like man I don't need.
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:36.000 I'm going to move for all that part you know only see okay it's like that is the difference you know but at the end of the day it's kind of like that's how we all are naturally right where if you see a big task or let's say you see like a goal right or something like this and you're like yeah man I want that goal I want that you know element of success or whatever and then you start like going for it and you the moment you realize that man this is going to take a lot more than I'm in the mood for whether things get boring or you realize it's more work or you realize shit I got to learn this new skill to even get.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:56.000 So to even get to step two and I didn't really account for that when I wanted that thing to begin with you start to be like well it's too it's too much you know so you so or even if it gets boring or something like that rather than analyzing be like okay well what would it take to do that oh no I kind of learned this okay let's learn that and then let's read about you know step by step by step.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:15.000 So the time in the beginning you just not in the mood for all those steps man you know you just revealed a pattern of thought that I have that I realize that I do all the time and I think it's actually very important and I've never really talked about it before effective but I think what it boils down to.
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:27.000 I look at things and I see them or I I will look at them until I understand that they are finite.
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000 That they're the things are finite there's whatever that thing is I will I can get to the end of it.
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:46.000 I can get to the end of it I can pull that string and I will get to the end that that thing is finite there is nothing.
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:58.000 There's nothing that I'm going to find on earth to to attack that's infinite right there's no infinite thing that I can think of that I would look at is with a view of like okay here's something I want to do oh it's an infinite task.
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:11.000 No doesn't exist there's nothing that I'm going to do that's an infinite task look at we could we say it's infinite that we want to continue to learn yes that's an infinite thing is it infinite that we want to try and.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:32.000 Improversal and get better yeah that's an infinite thing is there any particular task that we can come across where it's infinite no you get a scoop of mask you get in the water you dive and you will find the bottom of that iceberg and maybe you have to come back up and get scuba tanks and you have to go down there maybe you've got to get a mini sub.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:41.000 But you can find the bottom of that thing and then guess what you can get it back up you can grab a little little pick action can start chipping away that thing.
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:55.000 Yeah and then and at that point really at the end of the day like if you be honest with yourself you can come to a point and determine whether or not it's worth it like if you go down you're like hey we're trying to move this iceberg because we want to do this and do that and whatever right and then you go there and you're like dang.
00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:07.000 This is this iceberg is way bigger than we thought and it's kind of not worth it or and goal isn't worth all that what we're going to expand you know think about your difference in mentality though.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:19.000 When you see that something is finite yeah that totally changes your attitude from thinking this thing could go on forever because now you're your.
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:30.000 Your efforts are futile literally futile yeah but once you know that their this thing is finite this job has a end guess what.
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:41.000 I'm going to start chipping and I can I can be persistent and I'm going to make progress you know what I don't know if this is like to the same thing but you have this thing where.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:33:06.000 You know the whole idea like doing something even though you don't feel like doing it yes like you don't really have that like you don't have the you don't have the opposite you like you don't have that thing that tells you hey like don't do it like if you don't feel like doing it don't do it if you think it needs to be done so having that quality helps that kind of situation so like okay I'll apply it to like working out right where what what so what's the thing that I quote don't don't have.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:23.000 Like you're behavior changing because you don't feel like doing something got it like so be like I don't feel like it but that's nothing to do with what I'm doing you know so like if you're about to work out and you're like man I got this hard workout I got 25 sets till failure today that's my workout with all these exercises and all this stuff.
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:45.000 If I don't have if I only got one hour sleep like that's just not doable for me you know the fact that the fact is it is doable it's going to suck but if that's not a factering you're thinking then you're just going to do it you're just going to the sucking part is just going to be part of the workout kind of thing and it's going to sort of get done so if you start thinking like that in the beginning like start asking yourself well.
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:56.000 Know that it can be done what will it take to get it done the workout and then you're like kind of the same stuff it always like that's the truth the same stuff it took last time you know.
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:04.000 It'll just suck less and then boom then you have that finite thing like oh I see exactly what's making me not want to do it and then you just sort of got to admit that to yourself.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:18.000 You you ever have like a horrible workout and then you think to yourself well okay. Sometimes I'll be staring at whatever workout and I know it's going to suck and you know what you know what I just realized I do.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000 I go well I'll start now it will be over in one hour and 20 minutes yeah I start right now it's going to be over to I know what I have to do.
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:37.000 I'll just turn off my brain it's but it becomes a finite thing yeah I make it I use time to put up to put a end on it in my mind I won't say all this workout's going to suck I'll go oh this workout's going to suck.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:51.000 It's going to be over now in 20 minutes done so and she's yeah I do the exact I mean essentially it's another version of that where okay when I first sort of started out I time my rest and I still do but I can time it in my head now way better because I'm so you stood or whatever.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:06.000 But if I'm like really not feeling like working out I'll set the timer right there so it's like the workout's gonna be done regardless regardless if I don't set the timer I'll take a little 10 20 second more rest and then it extends it out more and become sort of this thing.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000 But if you the timer's rolling right there you're going to do it whether you feel like because that's part of the workout and then you're done and you're just done it actually goes quicker.
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000 So I'm going to do the one of the hardest moves to make one of the hardest movements to make in the gym is present start on the stock.
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:32.000 I do that something I'll write it like in I'll write it on social media I'll be like him hand in hard has it a weighted stretch some more.
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.000 Get a little more warmth like just per and it's usually it's facing it's usually squats where you're like okay we know maybe I should just do a little bit more stretching.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:55.000 Maybe I should do a little bit more overhead squat form with the PVC just to make sure I'm good and you do all these things and all you're doing is just putting it off and then finally I go okay you know what shut up and when I go this thing only ends.
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000 When I start it can only end if I start.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000 This thing can only end if I start it.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000 That's a good thing to say I never tried to make it only end if it starts.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000 I'll do stuff all like organize little thing like oh man that's kind of messy right there.
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000 You know like yeah good stuff you're clean bro.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000 That's good I've never gone that far.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000 I might do an extra couple sets of warm up but I'm not starting to vacuum.
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000 Oh that's sketch dude.
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000 Oh man.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000 Check.
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000 All right.
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000 Getting back to the book.
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000 Everything that I have said about the balancing of unit activities is doubly valid for the training program itself the most valuable resource available to the commander is his men's time.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000 And time once lost can never be regained that's fitting.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000 Time once lost can never be regained poorly.
00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:01.000 Politely prepared unimaginative or unnecessary instructions waste soldiers timed worse it is boring.
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000 And soon results in ineffective poorly trained individuals with no initiative or a spree.
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:18.000 The skillful commander is the one who adopts the philosophy of gainful employment for each man and one who takes maximum advantage of every training hour to ensure value received.
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000 Man.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000 Remember all that dumb training you did in the military.
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000 I do like do when they started.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000 Yeah you had just do some training years ago man this is just horrible.
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000 Horrible.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000 What are we doing?
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000 It's a waste.
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000 In this respect prior preparation and effective supervision are essential.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:55.000 Prior preparation must not be limited to determining merely what is material is to be res-meatly what material is to be presented and gathering appropriate training aids.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:05.000 Meetings and rehearsals should be held for appropriate officers at non-commission officers efficiently and advance to ensure that the training preparation meets the desired standards.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000 Hey prep for your training.
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000 If you're an instructor you owe it to the students.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:28.000 Never less a commander must realize that the instructor is his most important training tool and that any time required including duty hours to prepare that tool for its job is time well spent.
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:39.000 The hours given to preparation and rehearsal of instruction will be repaid many fold in the hundreds of man hours that are saved by not wasting soldiers time with poorly presented training.
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000 Totally legit.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:52.000 Don't waste your people's time and if you actually want to apply decentralized command the best thing you can do with your time is train your people.
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000 It's the best thing you can do.
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000 I think we talked about in the last podcast about how much you learn when you teach.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000 We're talking about that.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000 I think on the very last time just how when you become an instructor that's when you learn the most man.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000 When you have guys on your team that can train.
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000 You want to talk about liberating yourself to do other things.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000 People talk about how hard it is to train your instructor.
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000 How hard it is to get your people where they need to be.
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000 That is time well spent is training your trainers.
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000 Again, I know he's where he pulls all this stuff from the experience this guy had.
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:41.000 Anybody and you asked me and I just sat there and just kind of got depressed hearing anybody that's ever had their time wasted by a bad instructor.
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000 I don't care if it's in school or anywhere else.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000 We all know that feeling of this is a waste of my time.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000 It's like the most corrosive thing you could do to somebody else as waste their time.
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000 Your instructors your men look instructors as a minimum.
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000 Synonym mentors teachers, leaders whatever that's what an instructor is.
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000 Those are the people that matter the most in organization because they're the ones actually responsible for other people's time.
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:12.000 I took over trade at and I had a meeting.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:21.000 I rolled into the meeting and I had like a wheel book or whatever a little notebook and I had like four bullet points of things I needed to tell the guys.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:34.000 I walked in there and I told the guys what I need to tell them and then I walked out and like one of my bros was like dude you can prepare to this stuff right and I was like easy like you can prepare to this stuff huh.
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000 I was thinking of myself.
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:45.000 Oh yeah, I mean what what's the alternative to walking there and really not know what the hell you're going to say.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000 That's crazy.
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000 That's that you know what that is that's disrespectful.
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000 Which I have a problem with.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000 There's a chunk in here about safety obviously always important.
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000 We work with a lot of industries that safety is is absolutely paramount where lives are at risk.
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000 So there's a section there about safety.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:15.000 The success of any safety program is dependent on the quality of support and leadership rendered by all unit commanders.
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:27.000 You know it's like oh we have a safety officer great that's great that you have a safety officer and guess who else is responsible for safety everyone.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000 Training under tactical conditions to me.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000 It is basic that all field training should be conducted under tactical conditions.
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000 Setting up an administrative bivouac is the easy way out.
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000 But it is bad practice and has no place in the field training of today's soldier.
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000 Each soldier participating in tactical training will learn to think and act in a manner fitting for combat.
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000 He'll make mistakes at first but it will be easier for him to overcome them in a tactical environment.
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000 Then it'll be easier for him to overcome them in a tactical environment than in an administrative one.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000 Realistic combat habits developed in training will be second nature to soldiers in combat.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000 Poetry in soldier.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000 The poorly trained soldier taken by surprise without a weapon in his rare in his hand really gets a second chance to amend his habits.
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000 So look, this the connection to the military here is obvious.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:36.000 When you're going to go to the range or you got range time, don't bring out an RV to sit around and play video games while you're not shooting.
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000 Go and set up tactical hidesites and spend time in the field and make the most of that.
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000 The same thing in the business world.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:50.000 Right? If we're going to train people for a certain scenario, think do it in the most realistic way that you maximize the training.
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000 After entering combat commanders will find it's too late to teach dispersion.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000 First aid marksmanship, camouflage, care and maintenance of equipment and the thousand and one other things that go to make up the well.
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:12.000 Train the soldier in unit. It is also a little late to furnish him and adequate training background of information.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000 So if you wait, it's going to be a problem.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:29.000 It's the similar thing of people that think, well, you know if I get into a fight, well, you know if I, well, you know if I, bro, I'll go full rage.
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:37.000 And they think that that's going to make up for 18 years of jujitsu wrestling, moits, I and boxing, right? It's not happening.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000 You, you, you, you, you'll lose. There's no, there's, you get too late.
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000 You have to train, you have to prepare before it actually happens from a leadership perspective.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:58.000 Isn't it crazy? Isn't it crazy to think that, hey, I can just roll into a leadership situation.
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:08.000 Without any training, without role playing, without thinking through some contingencies in my mind, and things are just going to go, I'll just know what to do.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:24.000 Why would you think that? Why would you think that? Why would you get that idea in your head that if you got to go talk to, you know, one of your subordinates that had an outburst and, and is upset about something, why would you think that just rolling in there?
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000 You'll just know what to do. Why would you not think through that? Why would you not train? Why would you not prepare?
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:39.000 If you have subordinate leaders that are working for you, why would you assume that if there's a contingency that unfolds that they're just going to figure it out?
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000 Why would you assume that they're going to know how to handle when somebody flies off the, off the handle?
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000 Why would you assume that they're going to know how to handle when a client comes in and is having a, having an outburst?
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000 Why would you assume that they're going to know what to do? And if they know what to do, why would you assume that they're actually be able to do it?
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:12.000 Because that's the next level, right? You can do the moves all day of Moetai and wrestling, but until you're going against someone, until you spar with someone, until you role play with someone, you're not actually able to do it.
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000 Why would you assume that? The answer is you assume that if you were dumb. Don't assume that.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:27.000 Train. Train for those leaders, situations. Train for those hand-to-hand combat situations.
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:39.000 Next section. Training for good habits and discipline.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:49.000 In battle, the habits and discipline that have been instilled in training are of supreme importance.
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:57.000 First, because men in combat will do instinctively what they have been in the habit of doing in training.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:09.000 And second, because only the extra drive of discipline will enable the soldier to overcome the fear that all men experience in battle.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000 There you go.
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000 Supreme importance, by the way.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:25.000 This guy is not throwing words around just because they sound good or just trying to emphasize something a little bit.
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000 He's using this word and might be the only time he uses it.
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:39.000 Habits and discipline are of supreme importance.
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000 Men will do in combat what they have been in the habit of doing in training.
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000 Every experience commander knows this, but too often he fails to appreciate the absolute necessity of practicing only correct procedures.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:03.000 It is essential that good habits be so deeply ingrained in each individual soldier through correct teaching and intensive practice that even under the stress of battle he will do the right thing, both immediately and instinctively.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:13.000 Conversely, because practice makes perfect a commander must never under any circumstances permit training errors to be repeated.
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000 There you go.
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:24.000 To the question of discipline, I would ask you to consider this more in the light of self-discipline.
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:33.000 Because all too often the word discipline takes on the connotation of restriction overbearing authority and blind obedience.
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000 We do not want an automaton.
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:49.000 We want an effective combat ready soldier who has a keen sense of duty and who feels an obligation to his commander to the meta-round him and to his unit.
00:47:49.000 --> 00:48:01.000 So anybody that's questioning, you know, even me, when I'm saying hey look you get some DNA coming from World War I, you get some of that, you get some of that feeling that he's sort of, hey listen, you know the rank structure important, you better do it yourself.
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000 There it is.
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000 Blind obedience, no not what we want overbearing authority, not what we want.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:18.000 Restriction on what you're able to do not what we want, what we want is self-discipline.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:27.000 I'm partially just enjoying picture and you reading that and the reaction you had is you reading that in general clerks spoke for the first time.
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:37.000 The only thing I wrote down I wrote down before he said this is the good news and all this when he's talking about the challenge of making real difficult and realistic training people like hard training.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:46.000 They like hard training, they respond hard training and for whatever pushes you away from not wanting to make things difficult, that's actually what your people want.
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000 When I look back and all the things that I did, the hardest things I did were the things I enjoyed the most.
00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:00.000 So whatever you're feeling like the harder it is the better it is because he talked about the end state of this is what's going to keep your people alive and warm for sure.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000 But hard training is actually what your people want.
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000 Funny you should say that.
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000 Let me read the next paragraph.
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000 Instilling discipline and troops is actually not as difficult as it may appear.
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:23.000 As a matter of fact the answer to instilling discipline can be given in one word training.
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000 Good training overcomes resistance to obedience and resentment of authority.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000 So I wrote about this in leadership strategy and tactics.
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000 You want to build morale in a team? You got to do hard things.
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000 Go through suffering together.
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000 That will bring your unit together.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000 That will increase your rear morale.
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000 It will also increase your discipline.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000 Yeah, that covers the tangible things.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000 It makes them better at the skill whatever skill you're training for.
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000 But the intangible things like morale.
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000 The discipline you just talked about.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000 The isprit to court.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000 The willingness to take and make sacrifices.
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000 That's the intangible qualities that also come from that as well.
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000 Which is every bit as important as being really good at your job.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000 I like this guy.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000 One of the keys to successful training is developing our men into the proper attitude toward training.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000 Generally, our men want to do what we want them to do.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000 And when they don't, it's usually because we have failed to instruct them properly.
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000 That's our fault.
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:30.000 A guiding principle that applies to all units and organizations is that a man must understand.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000 Clearly, what is expected of him.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000 Nearly telling him is not enough.
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000 He must be instructed.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000 Proper training will also foster pride and confidence in the individual.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000 A pride and confidence that will be extended to his leaders and units as well.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:56.000 When that pride and confidence have been nurtured to a point that obedience becomes a habit and response becomes natural and willing.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000 You've gone a long way toward your goal of combat readiness.
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000 As you can see, habit and discipline go hand in hand.
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000 A poorly disciplined unit is evidence that its commander has failed to instill proper habits through
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000 his training program and right from the very start.
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000 Now, again, you feel a little bit of lean back, right?
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000 A little bit of lean back to obedience becoming a habit.
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000 And response becomes natural.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000 So you get a little bit of a lean back towards, alright.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000 So now we're getting somebody that's going to be like obedience is sort of part of that discipline.
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000 Even though he said earlier, look, we don't want automotons.
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000 We do not want automotons.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000 It's not what we're looking for.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000 It's not what we're trying to, it's not what we're trying to train.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000 That's the last thing that I want.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000 Decentralization of responsibility.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:54.000 Once he has set his goals and started his training program and motion, a commander must rely upon the initiative of his subordinates.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000 G.
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:04.000 By properly delegating responsibility and the related authority a commander will foster this initiative and will enhance the development of all subordinates.
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:14.000 If you're in an office, there's a non-commissioned officer like I must emphasize here that this principle cannot be restricted merely to the training program, but should extend to all unit activities.
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000 This is it.
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000 This is the decentralized command.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000 This is the fourth law of combat.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000 Decentralized command.
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000 Doesn't only apply to training.
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000 It doesn't only apply to planning.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000 It doesn't only apply to operations.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000 It applies to everything.
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000 Decentralized command is how you need to operate.
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000 How many officers are doing the jobs of their non-commissioned officers?
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:47.000 We speak of enhancing the prestige of our non-commissioned officers, but the best possible way of doing this is by giving them responsibility to do the jobs themselves, while also insisting that they accomplish them properly.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000 What's that?
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000 Giving people ownership.
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000 Let them do it.
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000 Try that with your kids.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000 Make dinner.
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000 Make tire-owned shoes.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000 Clean your own room. Do your own laundry.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000 Make them responsible.
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000 Decentralized that command.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000 Get guess what you can do that.
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000 Then you can focus on getting them better training.
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:18.000 This is not to say that the commander should abdicate his own responsibility.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000 But a one-man shop of is a one-man shop is evidence of poor leadership.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000 There you go.
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000 If you're running everything, bad leadership.
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:41.000 A good commander will patiently and carefully instruct his subordinates to ensure they know what is expected he may even have his subordinates return and present their plans for accomplishing the tasks.
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000 But he will then insist that they get the jobs done without detailed guidance.
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000 Now we're back to like this leaning back towards, hey, I'm not going to tell you exactly what to do.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000 Look, I want obedience, but you go figure out what you want to do.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000 So he's balancing this dichotomy of leadership between, hey, you need to put some structure in place so people know what to do.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000 But I still want you to go and figure out how you're going to get it done.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000 It's almost like you have to take the word obedience.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000 And change what that natural reaction you have is, I hear the word obedience.
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000 I don't like that word.
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000 There's a, I don't like that word.
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:23.000 And just like you described, I actually don't, I don't want my people to feel like they have to be obedient to me.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000 And so it's almost as if the obedience isn't, I say to do something and you do it.
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:35.000 It's the obedience is it's the natural, almost unspoken reaction that what we need to get done is going to get done.
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000 As opposed to you will do what I say.
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:43.000 Because that, if that's the obedience you're looking for, you actually just, you're just hurting yourself in so many different ways.
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000 But there's, there's language in here when I hear you say it might kind of get that little like, oh, I don't like that.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:56.000 But as he explains it and kind of peels that back, the obedience he's referring to isn't, I demand you to be obedient to my orders.
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:03.000 It's, I want, and when he talks about decentralization, I want the obedience to be, we are going to, I dissolve this problem.
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000 We're going to get whatever needs it get done.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000 I'm actually going to have you figured out half the time.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:15.000 Yeah, and I think to take what you just said and to take it one step further, what obedience is.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:23.000 And, and it's, it, everything he is saying is leading towards the result of what obedience is.
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000 If you're obedient, you're driving towards accomplishing the mission.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000 That's it. That's what that's my obedience. We got a mission and I'm going to accomplish it.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000 That's what I'm going to do.
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000 Yeah, because he's literally saying without detailed guidance, I'm not going to tell you how to do it.
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000 Here's the mission, go accomplish it. That's obedience.
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:51.000 By giving them responsibility and authority and by underwriting their honest mistakes, he will encourage them to exercise initiative and accept responsibility.
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:59.000 He will help them to develop into more effective individuals and hence into more effective soldiers and officers, this internal result of a better unit.
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:07.000 That sentence right there, giving responsibility and giving authority and underwriting their mistakes.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000 I can't even get a mistake. I got it. No problem.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.000 It's no problem. You're, you're encouraging them.
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:22.000 That's how you create leaders that are going to take initiative, which is exactly what you want.
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000 If you're a good leader.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:32.000 A problem arises when individuals are given the authority to make decisions on various types of actions and then fail to use it.
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.000 How much time is wasted by passing the buck to the next level even though authority existed to make a decision on the spot?
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000 Training supervision, proper supervision of training still remains primarily the commander's responsibility.
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.000 A good moderate of iron mind is an organization does well. Only things the boss checks. He goes over that over and over again.
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.000 He talks about inspections again here. We covered that on one of the earlier podcasts.
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000 And one thing he does say and I'll just re-emphasize it. A word of caution is in order.
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000 Inspections that are poorly scheduled or executed will harass the troops.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000 And if you're harassing the troops with your little freaking inspection, you're wrong.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000 You're wrong. That's not what inspections are for.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000 Training methods.
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.000 Proper methods of training will produce better soldiers in less time and hence speed the building of combat ready units.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:39.000 A discussion on training methods invariably includes a question of the committee system versus the unit method of training, which is better.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:46.000 Probably a combination of the two methods at the lowest practical level of command is the best answer.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000 Descentralize command.
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000 Small unit commander should be responsible for the bulk of training.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:59.000 Although specialized subject or those involving a small segment of several units often lend themselves to centralized instruction by committee.
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:07.000 So that's all good stuff. If you've got some universal skill that everyone needs to learn, hey, send people to a schoolhouse for that.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000 We get that.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:16.000 And you know, he goes in through these things.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:27.000 He talks about some bad practices as well. Bad practices such as having men waiting line to run a lane on the assault course or having men wait behind the ready line to fire on a range.
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000 You got to eliminate those things. He says.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:37.000 And he says it cannot be emphasized too often that a man learns best by doing.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:43.000 In every appropriate subject or element training, practical application must be stressed.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000 You got to do sometimes I would get these instructors.
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000 I remember especially going through close quarters combat training.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:04.000 You know, so clearing rooms and in the beginning when you're taking a task unit through the instruction of room clearance is you know, you started a very fundamental basic level and guys are doing one and two man room entries.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000 That's the start.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000 Sorry, two man room entries.
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:22.000 And so like I would get basically maybe take two platoons to do two different sections that kill us and one of the instructors would be a guy that would focus on really explaining things a lot going into a lot of detail.
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000 Maybe maybe like to hear himself talk a little bit.
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.000 The other person maybe is a guy that's okay. Here's what you got to do.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000 Alright, let's start running. Let's start doing it.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:41.000 And by the end of the day, I'd have to switch the platoons because the platoon that was doing would be way ahead of the platoon that was listening. You have to freaking do stuff.
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000 You have to freaking do stuff.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000 Would you write down?
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000 No, no, no.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000 I mean, you got to remember to, I'm sitting here listening as you're talking about it.
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000 I'm hearing it from you through him for the first time connecting it to the things that I've experienced.
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:05.000 And I'm hearing all these little, there's all these common things he keeps coming back to. He's talking about not wasting people's time. He's talking about pushing decision making down.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:14.000 He's talking about giving your people authority and responsibility and then taking ownership of their honest mistakes.
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000 A great way to not waste your people's time.
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000 It's to not have them be reliant on you to make decisions for them.
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000 And as you push that decision making down your subordinate leaders get closer and closer to the problem.
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:35.000 And their ability to solve those problems and do things that are constructive and useful for their people is them not being reliant on you.
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000 And why wrote it down is he asked a question in the beginning he said,
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000 How many officers are doing the jobs of their non-commission officers?
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000 How many leaders are making decisions and doing things on your team in your organization right now that you really shouldn't be doing?
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000 And the answer is probably almost all of you.
01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000 And if you can just have a mental exercise of, let me just think for a minute of any task that I do that I really shouldn't be doing.
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:09.000 If you're doing that, you are wasting your people's time, you're hindering their development, find a task that you shouldn't be doing and push it down to them.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000 And then when they screw it up, take responsibility in order to train them better, resource them better.
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000 But as you push those decisions, push that decision making down, you waste less of their time.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000 And just hearing him connecting all these things together and how crazy it, how simple it sounds when he says it.
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000 But how often we don't do the very thing he's describing.
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:39.000 And isn't it strange that this is a guy that spent 45 years in the military and it, well, 45 years in the military whatever 50 years ago.
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000 And actually, a hundred years ago, because he, he was got in in 1917.
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000 So, go on 103 years ago and he spent his whole life in the army, multiple wars.
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000 But what we're talking about, you and I, we definitely apply it to, we reflect on our time in the military.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000 And we reflect on businesses right now in every single industry that we work with all the time.
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000 We talk to on a daily, how many companies do you talk to a day?
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000 Three, four, five different companies a day, every day. Me too.
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000 And personnel at different levels inside those companies and all these things apply.
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000 All these things apply.
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000 Universal. There are universal truths to leadership.
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000 There really are universal truths to leadership.
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000 Improvement through ideas, research and development.
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.000 The army is constantly seeking ways and means to improve the training of the individual as well as to develop and improve equipment and procedures.
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.000 Research into new and more modern methods and ideas is a continuing process.
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000 Various organizations both military and civilian to vote all the energies to prod, to projects of a research nature.
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000 And he goes on talking about that, applying well established scientific principles to military problems.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:06.000 These groups observe the test individuals and units over a period of time to determine the best method of performing a specific operation or the
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000 invasibility of adopting a specific item being studied.
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000 So he looks at things not saying, hey, I got the answer.
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:24.000 That's him saying, look, we got a, you got to bring in experts that actually can study and see what the right answer is.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:34.000 Commander should always encourage imagination and ingenuity seeking better ways to solve their training maintenance and management problems.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000 Next section.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000 Chapter 9, training the individual.
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000 Adjusting the soldier to his new career.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000 The individual begins his military career in an army training center or in a selected unit.
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000 To the new soldier, this is the front door to the army.
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000 Here, he gets his first taste of military life.
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:09.000 This is where he is indoctrinated in the fundamentals of military service and where he forms the thoughts, ideas and habits that stay with him throughout his service and that go with him when his service is terminated.
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:18.000 From this starting point in his career, the soldier will develop in proportion to the effort made to put him on the right track.
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000 And to the application of sound training practices during this vital period of adjustment.
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000 This is something that I absolutely saw all the time.
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000 And I don't know if you would, I don't know if this would apply to find jets.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:39.000 But what you learn, what guys learn in their first seal platoon, they always are biased towards that as being the right thing.
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:47.000 Doesn't matter if it is right or wrong, archaic or not, new old, they, with they learn in that first platoon, they always, I know I always was.
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:55.000 And I had to fight against that unnatural bias or natural bias that I would have towards, hey, well, you know, this is what I learned, this is the way you do it.
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:04.000 I guess that first thing you learn leaves the deepest, the deepest scars, the deepest trail.
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000 Does that happen with flying jets?
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000 Totally man.
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000 You show up in your first squadron and the things that the more experienced guys are saying is gospel.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.000 And it's probably not a lot different for you, you know, most guys that did what I did, we spent our whole lives dreaming about doing it.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:27.000 And by the time you finally got to your first squadron, which was the, the top of the mountain you've been climbing your whole life.
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.000 Everything there is what is everything that said there is gospel, because you made it to where you wanted to be.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000 And these guys that have been there are telling you, that stuff is seared in your brain.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000 And the truth is, it's not all right.
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000 A lot of it is, is not right. And it's really hard to undo those bad habits.
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000 Same thing happened to me, I got there first squadron people are talking, that is burned into my brain.
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000 Is there anything that you learned in your first squadron that later you were like, wow, I learned not the wrong way.
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000 Yeah, a lot.
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.000 You would like to do this a lot when you, when you tell stories about what was unique about task unit bruiser.
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.000 And the uniqueness of that was was a lot less about the tactics and the maneuvers that you executed it.
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:20.000 And the weapons and things like that, it was so much more about the culture of the mindset and the, and the, the recognition of ownership and leadership being the thing that's going to make unique.
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000 What I learned or looked back on in my, in my, the lessons of my first squadron, certainly learned something,
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:34.000 I was like, hey, that's not the best way to run the system or the best way to move over your aircraft, but what I learned the most in retrospect was the leadership of those either good or bad.
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000 And it's really hard to diagnose bad leadership when you're a really young guy, at least initially.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000 You'll show up and kind of whatever's going on there like, okay, this is how it is cool and you kind of get on board.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000 And it's actually connected to to a note that I wrote when you were talking about people walking in the front door.
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000 We may think we've got a lot of time with those new folks, but they start to form those opinions very quickly.
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000 You know, the first couple days are just kind of clueless, they're just going to get on board.
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.000 But very quickly, they're going to start to take note of what's going on around them, and they're going to acclimate to whatever type of leadership you give them.
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000 And if it's good leadership, they're going to align with that, and if it's not, they're going to align with that too.
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.000 And so the clock that you're running with these new folks, they start to move to whatever direction you push them very, very quickly.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:30.000 And what I look back on is the lessons that I learned I look back like man, I thought that squadron was really good and it really wasn't.
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:43.000 We didn't do a lot of these things that we should have been doing, and it's mostly centered around the things you've always talked about about, hey, you know what, when we take our squadron up to Fallon for three weeks for a big Fallon air wing debt.
01:07:43.000 --> 01:08:00.000 You know what we're doing on Friday nights, everybody's going out to the bars and Friday nights, and that's what we did. And when I was in squadrons units that they didn't do those things, because they knew that they had limited window for training and they're going to stay and and get better.
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.000 That's when the contrast became much more clear about the things that I'd grown up with that weren't nearly as good as I thought they were at the time.
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:24.000 And look man, when you're in the other side and you tell the stories about trade at when you've seen 10,000 runs of the same clearance, literally just thousands upon thousands, it becomes very easy to see what good and bad looks like.
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:39.000 Yeah, the PID, the positive identification of good and bad man, I don't know why I was paying attention to that stuff when I was a young frog man. And it was.
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:59.000 You know, we showed up in the 90s man, we showed up in the 90s and the 90s was after the 80s and I know that by it's sound funny, but it's important because the 80s there was basically no war.
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:12.000 I mean, most of the 70s. Yeah, so think about that. You know, like the last seal puttune in early 70s, one of the 72 73 something like the last seal puttune, there's a couple more stragglers over there.
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:29.000 But then you go 70, then you go all the way to 1980, then you go all the way from 80 to 90 and you had to look, you had Grenada handful of guys you had Panama handful of guys and by handful, you know 50 guys whenever the number is, but it's a very tiny percentage of the community.
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:44.000 And then you roll into the 90s, but I'm coming off the 80s. So understanding what it meant to be combat ready was a faded picture.
01:09:44.000 --> 01:10:02.000 And there were some guys that knew and they think God, thank God some of those old Vietnam guys were there, thank God some of the second, some of the people that had learned firsthand from the Vietnam guys, they were there to to hold that line.
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:16.000 There was also guys that were, you know, we ain't going or we ain't going or you were going drinking. You know, that's what, and even if we're not going drinking, you know what, we're not going to we're not going to we're not going to war.
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:38.000 We're going to hang out with our family, we're going to go run some side business, we're going to go do other things besides just be a team guy. And and that's a weird place to come from it's a weird place to roll into the teams when you have these expectations like I had the I had the dumbest expectations, you know, I thought I was going to numb.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:11:02.000 I was going to numb in 1994, I was ready to freaking deployed to the Nang. You still think I still kind of do you think that man, whatever I talked to till those guys, I remember asking till like, was it hard to, no, maybe it was it was Dick Thompson, I was like, was it hard because he volunteered for this volunteer for that and I said, was it hard to volunteer? He's like, nothing.
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:18.000 They were like, oh, you want to go to special forces, cool, right over here. Oh, you want to go to dog cool right over here. Oh, you want to be an officer cool right over here. You step right. Oh, yeah, we got openings man. We got openings. Why do we got openings we got openings we got more than 100% casualty rating.
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:38.000 If you show up here, you will be wounded or killed. How's it going? You get there's the line. And those till Frenchman Dick Thompson just rolling in just yeah good. Let's do it. What do you got? We can't tell you about it cool. I'll sign up. What I put my name.
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:52.000 Don't do the titles for the song episodes of this podcast, Dead Man Walking. Don't go to song. That's what that was the word. That was the gouge. Did you use that term? The gouge?
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:06.000 Totally. That was the gouge. Don't go to song. Don't go to song. And these guys are like, well, why wouldn't we go to song? Everyone gets wounded or killed. Oh, cool. Sign me up.
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:19.000 So I thought I was going to know. So when I get to the team and and you know what I had to do with Vietnam, I got Vietnam era aged gear.
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:31.000 Left over from the home. I got that. You couldn't tell the difference when you saw me going through SQT, my like the gear that I used was Vietnam gear. Like that's the same gear. The same canteens.
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000 The same mag pouches, everything was the same. So I was kind of going to know.
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:47.000 But that impression that you get in that first poll tune, man, it leaves a mark. It leaves a mark.
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.000 And so that's why if you're in a leadership position and you got people checking on board, you got to recognize that you're making a mark.
01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:08.000 Don't play around with that. Assentual to the smooth and orderly transformation of the individual from a citizen to a soldier is the organization and caliber of the training establishment.
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:16.000 The commander of this training activity must be given the tools to work with and enough priority to ensure assignment of the most competent officers and men.
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:29.000 Personnel should be carefully selected, highly motivated and imbued with the standards prescribed for basic combat training. A prerequisite for later command has its foundation in this criteria.
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000 Until an officer, a non-commission officer, has served in these capacities, he is handicapped in the auto training units.
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:45.000 Well, that's powerful. How often is it that we actually invest our best people into being instructors? Not often enough. Not often enough.
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:53.000 You guys do it. The top gun, does it? Yeah. Well, I was thinking that you guys do it as well. I mean, the pedal is between what you did in training.
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000 This is the thing. When I got into the teams, no one wanted to go to training.
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:03.000 It was, hey man, I don't want to go over there. I want to go into pulling it. Yeah. I want to go to nom.
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:10.000 I want to go into pulling it. That's why everybody wanted to do. Part of the reason was because one of the ways that you got credit.
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:18.000 Yeah. Was by doing deployments. Right? Hey, I did three deployments. I did four deployments. I did five deployments. You're in a packing order. There was a packing order.
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000 So nobody wants to get out of that cycle. They just want to go on deployment deployment deployment deployment.
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:31.000 Because you want to go up that hierarchy. You want to be five platoons. You want to be seven. But do you want to do as many platoons as you can? As fast as you can.
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000 It's kind of funny because when the, you know, you'd be a new guy in your first platoon.
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:46.000 But then I was talking to a nom guy. And he was like, you're a new guy until you go into combat.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000 So all you motherfuckers and cherries.
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:59.000 He's like, Roger that. Who's dude sitting there with six deployments under their belt, but they never went to war. So he's just like, yeah, cherries.
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:08.000 Whatever. Yeah. Cherry boys, whatever. Keep keep it up.
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000 Well, life.
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:20.000 Trainer personnel will face many problems with their new soldiers. Trainies come from every aspect of life. So this is what I think the reason I wanted to cover this part is because we work with companies all the time.
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000 They hire people all the time. What's your indoctrination program? How are you welcoming them aboard? What are you doing to train them out of the gate?
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:37.000 Oh, you got a, you're so critical to get them in the role that you can't spare four days to set aside and get them trained up and familiarize and meet them with the right people. You can't do that.
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:45.000 It's more important that you just get them totally blind rolling into their role. That doesn't make any sense man set aside some time.
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000 Training's come from every walk of life. All kinds of schooling. Other civilian experience. Multi-to-devaputates beliefs skills.
01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:06.000 From this complex mixture of raw material, the training unit commander has to turn out train soldiers who are ready to undergo further training and ultimately become combat ready fighters in the army's combat ready units.
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000 During this period of his training, it's new soldier will have to learn how to live as a soldier with other soldiers.
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:24.000 He will learn to accept discipline to keep physically fit to develop proper habits of eating, sleeping, recreation and sanitation and to live harmoniously with his fellow soldiers.
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.000 These things will not come easily to all trainees. Many will need lots of help and lots of guidance to overcome their troubles.
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000 Their commanders are the ones who can and should give the assistance.
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:42.000 Networking. This is where you're going to develop these people that have just their just random.
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:49.000 I know I never, I always joke about the fact that I never lost my teeth until I joined the Navy and in boot camp.
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000 They're like, you need to foster teeth every night and all.
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000 Whatever. I've never, I've lost my teeth every night since then.
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:06.000 I was just a savage that didn't floss my teeth, but that's one of the many habits where they, in this way, what you do. This way you're supposed to do cool. How do that?
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000 I'm that kid.
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000 Of course, I can floss some of my teeth with like a piece of rope.
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:24.000 Although new soldiers are being trained as replacements for other units, all training commanders will do well to look at their trainees this way.
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000 These are my men. I will train them as if I'm going to fight alongside them and as if my life will someday depend.
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000 Be in their hands.
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:40.000 That's that's that is one cool thing that you hear from guys that worked as Buds instructors is the attitude of like, hey, this, do I want this guy in a pool team with me?
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000 Right. That's a great place to start.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000 That criteria is is is so important. I mean, yeah, top can we talk to a little bit maybe a difference.
01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:02.000 There was there was a key in emphasis put on training in my community. Top can was obviously a place that resembled reflected that apex of that training facility.
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:18.000 If you want to call that, but really what it was there was a chance to pass on information to teach guys and the criteria for finishing that program was if you was an instructor who was going to, if I'm going to put that top gun patch on your shoulder, the criteria was what I go to war with you.
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000 That was the criteria. Is this guy someone that I would go to war with as his wingman?
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000 And again, you've talked about it.
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:36.000 It may be a little bit more evident in the military example because we're talking about literal war and we're talking about a guy who's written something based on his experiences in war.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000 But the translation to anywhere in the private sector, even your own family, isn't that hard.
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:50.000 What is the criteria that really matters to you what you'd be willing to do with or for this person? It doesn't have to be war as the outcome.
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000 And talking about the investment you're making in your people up front, you can use spare.
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000 Can you spare a week to put this person on the right path?
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:07.000 So his ability to be successful in the organization is 100 times greater than if he just shoved him out there because we're under staff.
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:16.000 After we got to get this job done, go get that person in the role. Yeah. Got to make the investment that you make up front will be tenfold.
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000 Then not making it.
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000 Next section is entitled The Army is built on discipline.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000 When a man comes into the army, he usually leaves home for the first time. He leaves behind his parents, his friends.
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:41.000 The inhibitions he has built up from being around those who have been close to him, without the restraining influence of these inhibitions.
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:49.000 And in the quick tempo of his new life as a trainee, he is likely to slip in morals in neatness and in energy.
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:55.000 The one thing that will keep him on the right track is discipline.
01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:02.000 Development of discipline is the best way to re-institute the desirable inhibitions he may have lost.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.000 How can commanders instill discipline in their trainees? The answer can be given in one word training.
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000 This is a rehash, right?
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000 Good training overcomes resistance to obedience and resentment of authority.
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:20.000 When obedience becomes habit and is natural and willing, training is paid off in terms of discipline soldiers.
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:29.000 Development of discipline can be part of every period of training. During basic training commanders have many opportunities to stress the importance of these things which take which make a discipline soldier.
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.000 obedience, alertness, neatness of dress and physical fitness.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000 The training will also develop a respect for commanders and a renewed devotion to his country.
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000 In battle, discipline is of supreme importance.
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000 This is the only time to use the word supreme.
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:54.000 Most men are afraid in battle, but discipline produces the courage to overcome this fear discipline as a soldier implies a sense of duty and obligation to his unit.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:01.000 When the soldiers of a unit share that obligation, the unit has gone a long way toward the goal of combat effectiveness.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000 Only one kind of discipline is acceptable. It is perfect discipline.
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.000 When trainees show evidence of poor discipline, it is general because their commanders have failed to insist on perfect discipline from the start.
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.000 And that is a pattern. That is a pattern quote. Only one kind of discipline. That is perfect discipline.
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000 He talks about getting to an overseas environment.
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:39.000 The new arrivals should be indoctrinated in the customs of the new country in which he is stationed. He should be encouraged to meet his new neighbors, learn their ways, study their language, become familiar with their history.
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000 And then he talks a skip forward a little bit too.
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000 Well, I got to cover this one. Let's see one of the little sections.
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.000 Simultaneously with his new geographical environment must come adjustment to his new situation environment.
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:05.000 The transformation is one of attitude in which the new arrival must be made to realize he is no longer in a basic training or garrison situation.
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:18.000 He must now apply the training principles and garrison experience he has gained. He must be made aware of the seriousness of his situation that he is in the front line of defense against aggression.
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:28.000 While there are many educational and recreational diversions overseas, the commander must keep the new arrival constantly alert for the necessity of keeping himself combat ready.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:42.000 The astute commander must be not only a leader and trainer of men, but a student of psychology and human nature as well.
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:52.000 He must be able to instill in his men the feeling that they can enjoy their tours of duty overseas benefit from the experience and at the same time be prepared to assume more serious endeavors when called upon.
01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:00.000 So there you go. You got to understand a human nature. You got to understand a little psychology.
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:11.000 Motivation for performance. It has been said that man is the army's most valuable asset even the greatest asset however becomes a liability if improperly used.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:26.000 The American soldier must be properly motivated before he will efficiently and willingly perform his assigned tasks from this motivation to develop his spree enthusiasm, morale, effort, competition and accomplishment.
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:39.000 When I mean motivation of the American soldier overseas is best accomplished when he number one knows why he is there.
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:46.000 That's the number one thing. The number way. Number one way to make sure someone's motivated make sure they know why they're doing what they're doing.
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000 Same answer. I give nine times a day.
01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:00.000 Is made to feel that he belongs. Is performing primarily a job for which he has been trained.
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:18.000 Know where his efforts fit into the big picture is recognized and rewarded for success. But one of those that I would say was a new thought in my mind was that is performing primarily in a job for which he's been trained.
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000 And I was kind of like, that's a good point. That's a good point.
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.000 Think about when you're when you're doing something like, oh yeah, this is why I've been this way learned.
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000 You know, in your jutsuits, it's real clear, right? Oh, I learned this escape and you use it. That's just a total reward.
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:44.000 Yeah. How about when you learn some new technical skill on the filmmaking and then you get to apply it? Sometimes you kind of force it in there.
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000 In many cases. Yeah. It's like you'll do it. Yeah, just because you're pursuing that very thing. Right.
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000 Yeah. So when it comes naturally when it naturally occurs, it's a super positive thing.
01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.000 Dave, how long were you in the Marine Corps for before you dropped a bomb on target from an F-18?
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:11.000 Uh, six years six years. Did that feel good? It did.
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000 Did that give you motivation. Crazy how to do the math there. I was thinking, man, how long was it?
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000 It was six years. What year did you get commissioned? 94.
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.000 And then you drop bombs. Bomb, you singular. You drop a bomb.
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:34.000 2000 in 2000. Yeah. Listen, like you said, man, remember, this is by all our straight up.
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000 You were straight up like top gone experience in the make, right?
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000 Like Maverick didn't Maverick have been closed fly by with the make. I'm saying that because in 2000 how many people
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.000 are was I look, I don't know if it's fact, but if it's not fact, it's really close.
01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:00.000 I was like the first guy in the world to drop a J-down because I had my squadron on deployment was the first
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000 watch in the next year. Yes. Good deal. Dave Burke is coming in hot.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000 But in at the time, billions of dollars developing this weapon system.
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000 You're the guy that gets to drop it. Again. Okay.
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000 Do you remember the date? No, remember the month. It was April of 2020.
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000 Okay. So April of 2000, we're going out there just just canvassing the world.
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:29.000 If there's anyone out there that knows anyone that dropped the J-down before April of 2000, please let us know.
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000 So I can put this guy over here. Good deal. Dave Burke.
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000 Check. Yes.
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000 And he been check.
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000 It's like you said though, man, I mean, first of all, at the time for me, that was it, dude.
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000 We're done checking the block. I can die happy man.
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000 It's because of what you said. There wasn't anything going on.
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000 I mean, you look back now, post 9-11.
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000 It's embarrassing.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000 I don't even like we talk about this all the time.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000 I don't even like bringing it up.
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000 But at the time, that was it.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000 And to get back to your more serious point of dude, what's I stoked?
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000 I never felt more useful in what I was doing than that night.
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000 I can picture it hitting that pickle switch and that bomb coming off my jet,
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000 blowing up that SA3 launcher in Iraq.
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000 That was like the most important thing I've ever done in my life.
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000 How many people did that after you dropped yours?
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000 Did things start to escalate?
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000 Well, no, we were just get the one.
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000 You're a deal, Dave Burke.
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000 Look, man, it was kind of a cool thing at the time it really was.
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000 And yeah, if I'm, if I'm out of turn, let me know.
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000 There's just not that many people out there that that is that put,
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000 have the potential of doing it, given the systems that required
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000 when the bomb hit the fleet and everything.
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000 It was a confluence of a lot of things that just went my way.
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000 So you're saying that in the whole fleet, the J.D.M. had just kind of arrived.
01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000 First of all, the J.D.M. had just arrived and what was required is a GPS aircraft
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000 on my carrier.
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000 There was one squadron that had GPS on board, which was that my squad.
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000 Yes, in your aircraft.
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000 In the aircraft, the other aircraft, the other four squadrons,
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000 couldn't even carry the weapon.
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000 And this was the first time.
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000 Yes.
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000 And Marine Corps got it before Navy.
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000 No, it's not that the Marine Corps got it.
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000 Just so happens at a my deployment, the three, the Navy squadron and
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000 the fighters, they didn't have GPS aircraft, which is kind of crazy.
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000 But we did.
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000 So again, so you dropped the first ever J.D.M.
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000 Like I said, if it wasn't the first, it was really close.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000 It was definitely the first one.
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000 What about what about Bosnia?
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000 What about Siri Avo?
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000 That's I'm almost positive that predaged GPS guy to weapons.
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000 That's all laser guided, some other other guidance systems.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000 That's not GPS guy to weapons.
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000 You're going out on the limb.
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000 I am.
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000 And look, fix it if I'm wrong.
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000 Dial in, send a message.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000 I'll be happy to get you.
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000 This is going to be J.D.M's hit your breath.
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000 If you have, maybe, when there's some guys that flew into a Siri Avo drop
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000 in bombs.
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000 Yeah, well, I mean, look, I could definitely be wrong.
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000 At the time, I wasn't like, do you know I'm going to add this to like your
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000 bio when I talk about you?
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000 Because you know I got my little, you know, he was this.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000 He was that.
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000 Now, I'm going to say he also dropped the first ever J.D.M.
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000 The first ever GPS guided munitions was dropped by
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000 Colonel Dave Burr.
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.000 The 2000 pound J.D.M. and the year 2000 was this brand new incredible thing
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000 that we just got trained on, which was kind of what was the circumstances that got you cleared hot.
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000 Yeah, the circumstances were, you know, during the day, I was scheduled for a night
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000 mission, just a pre scheduled mission that probably involved, you know,
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000 handful of airplanes doing operations Southern Watch, just kind of monitoring the airspace,
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000 which we did.
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.000 I was on deployment right on.
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000 I was on deployment.
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000 Yeah, I was about to head home.
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000 What aircraft carrier were you coming off of?
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000 The Stennis.
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000 Was the JFK?
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000 Did you replace the J ever place the J?
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000 I was on the JFK.
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000 So I guess I missed you.
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000 That's, as we're talking, that's the other carrier that would have had the potential.
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000 I think there was only one squadron on that carrier, the other Marine Horn
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000 squadron might have had the chance, so if it's going to happen, it's going to be off that carrier.
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000 But between the JFK and us, during that, you know, spring to summer of 2000,
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000 which was just monitoring the no flies on what happened was in the middle of the day on a day that
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000 I happened to be already hard scheduled.
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.000 We got triggered what's called an RO response option, which means,
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000 Saddam did something that met some criteria that we had a pre plan response to.
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000 And what he happened to do in this case was took a sam launcher south of, you know,
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000 the parallel, the line that we were, that we were responsible for.
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000 So until says, hey, they moved to Sam site down south of work.
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000 And they're not allowed to be here below this line.
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000 They can't be here.
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000 And the big debate was, so we got this information, this intelligence.
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000 The debate was, hey, we're not going to let the brand new guy go on this mission.
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000 This is a response option that mandates we're going to go below this thing up.
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000 And my squadron commander was like negative.
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000 That's the schedule.
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000 He's going fine.
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000 And if it wasn't way you were a new guy,
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000 I was just your first.
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000 Yeah, my first cruise, my first appointment.
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000 Go, go, go.
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000 And the only reason I was on there was just, you know, every fourth or fifth night,
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000 you just ended up on the schedule.
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000 I was, you know, dash whatever of this, of this mission.
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000 It turns out that my flight lead.
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000 Yeah, I'll tell you, I've, look, I'm, I'm all about being fair and everything.
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:41.000 If I was the squadron commander or the squadron exo or the ops officer or one of the other.
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000 And he brought me help in the squadron.
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000 And he was like, uh, that new guy just broke his left heel.
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000 Yeah.
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000 You got heel.
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000 We're, I don't know what happened.
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000 But I'm taking his place.
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000 Dude, it was one of those things that they, the air wing had schedule
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000 Responsibility to cover the no-fly zone.
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000 I was on the schedule.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000 It was going to be a totally boring night mission, which we'd done all the time.
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000 I was just covering the no-fly zone.
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000 Middle the day this happened.
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.000 We knew that that package that was going in was going to go from a, a monitoring mission
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000 to a targeting mission.
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.000 The, the mission loadout required a GPS guided weapon.
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:21.000 There happened to be one aircraft in that formation from one squadron that had the GPS aircraft
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000 and GPS guided weapon.
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000 I was there.
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000 I was scheduled for that.
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000 There was a, behind this, this conversation.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000 I was not part of a, whether this new guy chip was going to get to go.
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000 Because this is garbage because he's brand new.
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.000 The squadron commander was like, I'm not building a habit pattern by which because of the mission.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000 I'm going to change the formation.
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000 He's a young guy.
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000 He could go do it.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000 I went and did it.
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000 I launched.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000 I joined on the wing of of some other squadron aircraft.
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000 We flew north for two and a half hours.
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000 I blew this thing up in a cameo.
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000 Were, were you nervous?
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000 I was ex, yeah, but not like, I was nervous, but not like.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000 Were you super confident?
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000 I knew that I was nervous.
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000 I was nervous and still got GPS bomb.
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000 I mean, is this a hard job?
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000 No.
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000 It is not a hard thing to do.
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:20.000 As a matter of fact, the beauty of this mission just to put things in context is that before I even got into my airplane, I was handed the precise latitude and longitude, which I pre-programmed into a, a basically a disk that I downloaded to the airplane.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.000 So before I even took off from the carrier, I, my aircraft and the bomb all knew exactly where to go.
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000 And it was literally, I'm just carrying this thing on my wing.
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000 My only job was to arm it up and press the button.
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:41.000 Do you, did you fly flat dumb and happy? Like, and I've certain altitude or you got come on, did you kind of like, hey bro, I would love to tell you the coolest story in the world.
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000 It's not a cool story. That's my trilogy.
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:50.000 Telling the story now is almost embarrassing because people listening now when they think about what we have done since 2001.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000 This story is the least exciting combat story you'll ever hear.
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000 And combat should be in quotes.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000 In 2000, it was the coolest thing I had ever done.
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000 We did a, we did a bunch of ship boardings in, on that deployment.
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000 Yes. So in the millennium deployment between 2009, 2009, 2000, we did like ship boardings overseas.
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:20.000 And one of the ship boardings that we happened to do was of a big Russian oil tanker, and it was on CNN and all this kind of stuff.
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000 So it was kind of the big mesh, kind of the same thing.
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000 And just to put it in perspective, when we got back, so we were on the carrier,
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000 and then we were another platoon from Team 2 that was on the Ark.
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:39.000 And when we got back, we had to like brief the CO and the common ore about like what we did on deployment.
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.000 And so we got to brief, you know, that we did this thing, which was kind of, you know, at the time was pretty cool.
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:56.000 And just to put it in perspective, what the other platoon commander briefed was that they did an inextremus,
01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:03.000 propeller clearance for the Ark ship, something got tangled into propeller.
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.000 And they like anchored the ship and they dove down and like cut the thing off and they kind of like helped.
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000 That was what they briefed. That sort of seal platoon did in, you know, in the year 2000.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000 And that was the highest level thing that they did with the most visibility that they could debrief.
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000 It was we did a maintenance dive on the ship we were on on board.
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:32.000 Yeah. So that just kind of tells you how what it was like in the times we're different back then, man.
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:41.000 So I'm 100% I can totally imagine what you were feeling going into this and coming out of it.
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000 Yeah. It was, it was awesome at the time.
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:57.000 And when I came back, I mean, the whole ship knew about it. There was a press release that I have a copy of somewhere that that the Iraqi media put out that, you know,
01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000 I honestly think he was like straight up a baby milk factory had been attacked.
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000 You know, the standard propaganda, you know, unarmed civilians were killed.
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000 The whole story that got into the Intel monster kingdom, they checked this out.
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000 This is a report from your attack. I've got all the stuff somewhere.
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000 I'm going to send it to your mom totally. Yes. Absolutely. So it was, it was an interesting time.
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000 It was a time that I had obviously none of us knew what was coming.
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000 You know, I didn't know the following, you're how much things would change.
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:32.000 And I actually thought at that time that was probably the only chance I was ever really going to have to do something that contributed to the mission.
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:40.000 Was it exactly how I felt. I felt like I finally did my job after a lifetime of dreaming about it and six years training for it.
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000 Little did I know. That's awesome.
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:52.000 So if you're in, if you're in Cag9 on the status or if you're in Cag2 on the JFK, which was 251,
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:58.000 was the Marine Hornets Squadron, let me know if I got my facts, not straight.
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000 But at that time, there was just not a lot going on.
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000 JVK did some work to ship you run to. They dropped some bombs.
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000 They did, but maybe not GPS guided. I don't think so.
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000 She liked it really matters, but call me out.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000 I don't get what it does.
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000 It did at the time, bro. I can tell you it did at the time.
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:25.000 She had a legit. He goes through looking at these, these items to to motivate,
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000 keep someone motivated.
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:36.000 First of all, a man does any task better when he thoroughly understands the reason.
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000 For performing that task.
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000 Surely you have heard the question of what am I doing here?
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000 What have you, the commander, done to answer this question.
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000 Have you made your troop information program merely a corner bulletin board in the
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.000 Daerum? Have you explained to your men the role of allied forces in your overseas
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000 area as part of the United States Army? And what it plays in that role?
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000 Have you discussed with them the threat of communism?
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.000 Have you shown them how an alert well trained strong force in peace time becomes a deterrence
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000 to aggression and armed conflict?
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000 So that's the why?
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000 And that's the why that we talk about all the time.
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000 You did he go ahead?
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000 Yeah, did they understand how what they're doing contributes to the mission?
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000 Yeah, it's as simple as that.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000 Yeah, and when you're working on the front lines of a factory,
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.000 look, if you understand how that contributes to everything that's happening and what we're trying to do,
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000 that makes a difference.
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000 The only way they're ever going to know that is if their leadership makes that a priority,
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000 though, or else they're going to get stuck down there and their perspective of the
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000 world's going to get smaller and smaller, they're going to feel more and more disconnected
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000 and they're not going to understand it. You have to make that happen.
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000 That will not happen on its own.
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000 That's one thing that's cool up at a origin.
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:05.000 You know, the troops that are on the front line, they see what's happening.
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.000 Right down to the fact that they can see people competing in their geese.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000 Right? They can see people working in the genes that they may, they get thank yous.
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:23.000 They get, you know, pictures of the genes being worn in North Dakota, being worn in Texas, being, you know, being used.
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:30.000 And it's awesome. And they know that they can feel what that means because it's bringing back the community.
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000 And so everybody understands that why it's so important.
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.000 Pete does a great job making that clear.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000 The second item I outlined as a motivation force is a sense belonging very few drives of a man or
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000 stronger than his desire for identification with a group.
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000 And he knows what that he is wanted. He has a definite niche, a specific job.
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000 And that his efforts contribute to the achievement of common goal.
01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000 Then he becomes proud of himself as unit and his superiors.
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.000 Develop your men, develop in your men this feeling of identification and your task will be lighter.
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000 Then when the chips are down and they are called upon to do battle.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.000 They will perform as members of an integrated team, not as individuals.
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000 This brings us to the utilization of man. And this is the story of Dave Burke.
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:31.000 Thousands of dollars were spent to train each man versus a basic soldier that is specific MLS is each man in the unit doing being used in the job for which he was trained.
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000 I realize only two well that commanders must occasionally put man off their jobs to meet temper requirements.
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.000 The men realize the necessity for this to too often or ever commander for gets to put the man back in the job for which he is trained.
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:53.000 The man do not understand this and such action is often demoralizing and resulting in the loss of unit effectiveness when it becomes necessary to assign an individual to a position other than the one for which he has been trained.
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000 The commander will rise in stature if proper counseling is given.
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000 Explain why the temporary assignment has been made.
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.000 And let that man know as soon as possible he will be reassigned to duties commensurate with his MLS.
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:15.000 One thing should be kept in mind however no amount of motivation will make a man tackle his job he knows is too big for him.
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.000 That's the infinite thing.
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000 Where a man fits into the big picture.
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000 Obviously important and then goes into that a little bit and finally there's a great deal of vanity in each of us.
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:37.000 And few things are more motivating than recognition for a war and reward for job well done.
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000 He then jump in forward a little bit.
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000 He's got a little section on physical fitness which I always like to cover.
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:52.000 The vision of a push button war suggests that the physical rigors of the battlefield belong to the past.
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000 Isn't that crazy 1963 he's thinking that?
01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000 Nothing could be farther from the true physical fitness in today's armies even more important than it has been in the past.
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.000 And this is especially true in overseas theaters where to meet any communist block aggression.
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000 The fighting man on the ground is the ultimate weapon.
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000 The fundamental factor of the decision.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:20.000 The soldier overseas must be combat ready not only in terms of equipment training and conviction but also in terms of ability to withstand the rugged demands of physical combat.
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.000 The time to begin is the day a new physical a new replacement arrives in your command.
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:34.000 In many cases he will be fresh from basic or advanced individual training and it will merely be a matter of maintaining his high state of physical fitness that he brings with him.
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.000 In other cases you may well have to start from scratch and bring the man up to the desired standard.
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:47.000 In both instances your solution as a commander is a physical fitness program that will provide for progressive and continuous physical conditioning of your men.
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:56.000 That the can and should be integrated into a phase of a phase of training in your program.
01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:04.000 As an asset to your unit commander is the highly developed sports program and he talks about how important that is.
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:10.000 How important it is to have these kind of programs where you're running.
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.000 He talks about care of equipment.
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:21.000 Got to take care of your gear. He uses this little quote and here remember the rhyme.
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000 The rhyme about for want of the nail and I never heard of you ever heard that point.
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:38.000 So I had to look it up for one of the nails the shoe was lost for one of the shoe the horse was lost for one of the horse the rider was lost for one of the rider the battle is lost for one of the battle the kingdom was lost all for the one of the horse you nail.
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000 Does that little thing.
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:47.000 Just that little just that little thing talks about.
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000 He goes into like this is where I started kind of reason through some stuff because he's talking about.
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000 He's getting in the weeds a little bit about how do you get people to take care of their vehicles.
01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000 He goes through some execution charts proficiency of weapons testing the abilities of soldiers.
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.000 He runs into this a little bit performance testing and talks about how you've got to continually test people.
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:20.000 So that you know that they can do their job schooling. He talks about schooling of the individuals and again this is he starts getting into some of the weeds.
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:27.000 And then he gets into professionalism and professionalism to me is you know a word.
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:38.000 You know talk about your first experience in the military and how that leaves a mark well in 1991 when I checked into seal team one.
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:44.000 There was an underlying theme of professionalism.
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000 It was hey you professionalism.
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:54.000 Seal team one the nickname for seal team one was style log team one because you know we had hair cut inspections every two weeks.
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.000 We are yeah then uniform inspections I think the first Monday of every month.
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:09.000 The seal team five they we can we can confirm this with Jason Gardner, but I don't think they had uniform inspections in the decade.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:16.000 So you know everyone looked at team one the style log team one and it was this is the underlying tone was professionalism.
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:28.000 Back to the book in today's army we can afford to keep only the worthwhile individual in our ranks every effort must be made to strive for professionalism in all things.
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:47.000 Retention of the desirable and dedicated individual is the goal constant supervision by officers and non commission officers is necessary to raise standards of performance a great deal can be accomplished by each individual by setting the example and being a professional himself.
01:45:47.000 --> 01:46:03.000 Any other thing demonstrated competence ability and efficiency i.e. professionalism will encourage new officers and enlisted men to make the army their profession.
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:25.000 This is a real professionalism for the career army officer many do not understand what is meant by professionalism i submit that professionalism to the young soldier to the career non commission officer to the young reserve officer on limited active duty and to the reserve officer on extended active duty is different from that applicable to the career regular army officer with 20 years of service.
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:38.000 I will explain this as I see it if you are in numerate if you would numerate the various things that have to be done in order to produce a combat ready army to meet the demands of our country in case of emergency.
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:54.000 I believe you will find that these necessary operations pretty well coval cover the field in creating an army so here's the list of things that you have to do in order to create an army raising an army.
01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:05.000 Supplying the army leading and commanding the army and ministering the army moving the army communicating within the army employing the army.
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:21.000 The rear regular army officer who wants to prepare himself to be a professional. She learned the general requirements techniques and principles of each one of these necessary operations. In addition.
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:35.000 He should become a master of one and have at least one other as a strong minor.
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:52.000 I think that's probably a pretty good place to stop right now we could go all day with this but what's interesting I find interesting about that is. If you've got ten broad operational fields in the army and you can only be a master in one of them.
01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:07.000 Because we just don't have the ability to be more than that you could be a minor another.
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:32.000 So I'm thinking how do you become a professional and I think the answer is humility. To actually know that you're not a master of everything. To actually know that you have shortfalls and you have deficiencies and then what you do is you surround yourself with people that are masters in those areas you build a team.
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:50.000 And that starts with humility it starts with knowing your weaknesses so you can turn those weaknesses into strengths by bringing the right people into your organization.
01:48:50.000 --> 01:49:04.000 There you go. Echo Charles. Yes speaking of turning weaknesses into strengths. Sure. Do you have anything that can kind of help us maybe turn weaknesses into strengths?
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000 Technically. Factually. Actually. Do you know your known for saying the word factually? I do know. Yeah.
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:20.000 Some people will occasionally just throw out just a factually like. Yeah. Apparently my daughter gives me shit.
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:32.000 So I couldn't you have to tell him. So yes. Okay. We're on the path right turning weaknesses into strengths. Okay. So the thing we don't want to worry about is our joint so juggle.
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:44.000 Speaking of comments. Maybe we should just ask the question you are gone for two podcasts. This whole sort of support section. You know, it was like, I don't know three minutes seven minutes.
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:59.000 I'm like, yeah, way too short. Maybe people could put in the comments. You know what, you know, how they're feeling about that. Maybe they missed it. Yes. Well, this will just say technically the support section factually as well. Yeah.
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:13.000 The support section and all these fine products and services are infused into the section as a whole same same thing. So the section isn't only about support. It's how to stay on the path straight up.
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:20.000 That's what the section is. If you want to, you know, get all naming naming things for a section.
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:34.000 So let's go anyway. Think you don't want to worry about is your joints when you're on this path that we're all on definitely no one to be worried about you're doing. So sure. So juggle supplements overall a bunch of supplements all juggle supplements called juggle fuel.
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:50.000 The joint supplements to keep your joints in the game don't have to worry about them. Talk to think about them. Don't have to consider them when you're doing individual specific things.
01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:04.000 Yeah, you know, it's funny. Individual specific things. That's the nonetheless.
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:20.000 You know, why because we're on this joint warfare super krill oil you go on that consistently you don't worry about none of that stuff you're worried about your gains. So speaking of gains boom, mock.
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:34.000 And then you're working out to bring down build back up. Oh good. Okay. So here's what we do on a discipline discipline. Go.
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:47.000 There's something to talk about. It's a little something called smashing pumpkin. Oh yeah. It's a new flavor. If you tried it. No, it literally came in when I was leaving. It is. It is at the top of my list. You got to get there.
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:59.000 It is it just is at the top of the list right now. It's just beat everything. Now part of that is because it's new and I'm sure there's some level of hey just like the variety and it tastes good to have something different.
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:14.000 But I am I already you know, Pete and Brian well, you know, it's a seasonal thing. I was like, no stop. This is not a seasonal thing. There's no this is this is a new. This is in the game. This is this is part of Jockel fuel smashing pumpkin.
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:28.000 I don't even I didn't even really understand what pumpkin have you ever eaten pumpkin before like when you were a little kid carbon pumpkin use eight some because you were not the raw pumpkin. I didn't know right. I was like, hmm, let's see what this tastes like. It doesn't taste like anything right basically it's slimy.
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:48.000 So I'm thinking what is what is pumpkin flavored milk going to taste like slime. I wasn't really sure because that's what pumpkin pumpkin has no taste kind of it's just sort of slimy. Yeah, so I wasn't 100% sure, but you know, these guys are all fired up and they send me the sample.
01:52:48.000 --> 01:53:16.000 And I mix it and I was like, good Lord, I don't even so it's it's a pumpkin spice flavor case. There's a cinnamon situation, but what it I don't know. Look, does it taste like pumpkin spice maybe I've never really eaten anything that tasted like pumpkin spice. Let me tell you this it tastes freaking good. It tastes real good.

02:01:38.80 --> 02:01:44.08 And I have a confession to make.
02:01:44.08 --> 02:01:46.92 You know how I'm always like, you know, I mean, I literally have written books about
02:01:46.92 --> 02:01:51.08 putting your people out of you and take care of the people and all that.
02:01:51.08 --> 02:01:53.08 You know the confession.
02:01:53.08 --> 02:01:58.24 So we kind of re-engineered the Delta jeans a little bit.
02:01:58.24 --> 02:02:00.28 We re-engineered the fabric a little bit.
02:02:00.28 --> 02:02:02.76 We re-engineered the cut.
02:02:02.76 --> 02:02:08.20 And so Pete sent me, like we went back and forth like three iterations.
02:02:08.20 --> 02:02:09.64 Finally sent the iteration.

02:10:13.36 --> 02:10:14.36 to us.
02:10:14.36 --> 02:10:17.72 And thanks to all the people in uniform out there right now, putting those lessons to
02:10:17.72 --> 02:10:25.64 the use, keeping democracy and freedom safe in the world and to police and law enforcement
02:10:25.64 --> 02:10:29.88 to firefighters, paramedics and EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, board of patrol
02:10:29.88 --> 02:10:33.60 secret service and other first responders.
02:10:33.60 --> 02:10:37.16 Thank you for keeping us safe here at home.
02:10:37.16 --> 02:10:45.04 And everyone else out there remember what you have heard from General Clark.
02:10:45.04 --> 02:10:48.56 Number one he said that it all starts with discipline.
02:10:48.56 --> 02:10:54.76 The army is built on discipline.
02:10:54.76 --> 02:11:02.32 So we're us, so we, as individuals, General Clark said that the one thing that will keep
02:11:02.32 --> 02:11:04.92 a trainee on the right track is discipline.
02:11:04.92 --> 02:11:10.92 That's the one thing, the supreme thing.
02:11:10.92 --> 02:11:16.16 So maybe we should be more disciplined and maybe we should stay on the right track.
02:11:16.16 --> 02:11:24.88 Maybe we should stay on the path every single day by getting after it.
02:11:24.88 --> 02:11:30.20 And until next time, this is Dave, Eneco and Jockel.
02:11:30.20 --> 02:11:43.64 I don't want Trump so many years right now, anymore.
