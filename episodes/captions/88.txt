[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast, number 88.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.
[00:00:07] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:13] I went into a public house to get a plane of beer.
[00:00:18] The public anye up and says, we serve no red coats here.
[00:00:23] The girls behind the bar, they laughed and giggled fit to die.
[00:00:29] I outstint to the streets again.
[00:00:32] And to myself says, I, oh, it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy go away.
[00:00:39] But it's thank you, Mr. Actons, when the band begins to play.
[00:00:43] When the band begins to play, my boys, the band begins to play.
[00:00:48] Oh, it's thank you, Mr. Actons, when the band begins to play.
[00:00:55] I went into a theater as sober as could be.
[00:00:59] They gave a drunk civilian room, but they hadn't known for me.
[00:01:05] They sent me to the gallery around the music halls.
[00:01:10] But when it comes to fighting Lord, they shoved me in the stalls.
[00:01:15] For it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy wait outside.
[00:01:19] But it's special train for Actons when the troopers on the tide.
[00:01:24] The trooperships on the tide, my boys, the trooperships on the tide.
[00:01:29] Oh, it's special train for Actons when the troopers on the tide.
[00:01:36] Yes, make and mock a uniforms that guard you while you sleep.
[00:01:41] Is cheaper than them uniforms in their starvation cheap.
[00:01:46] And hustling drunken soldiers when they're going large a bit
[00:01:51] as five times better business than parade in full kit.
[00:01:56] Then it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy house your soul.
[00:02:01] But it's thin red line of eros when the drums begin to roll.
[00:02:06] The drums begin to roll, my boys, the drums begin to roll.
[00:02:11] Oh, it's thin red line of eros when the drums begin to roll.
[00:02:17] We are no thin red eros.
[00:02:20] No, we aren't no black guards too.
[00:02:24] But single men and barracks most remarkable like you.
[00:02:29] And if sometimes our conduct is an all-year fancy paints,
[00:02:34] why single men and barracks don't grow into plaster saints.
[00:02:40] While it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy fall behind.
[00:02:45] But it's please walk in the front sir when there's trouble in the wind.
[00:02:49] When there's trouble in the wind, my boys, there's trouble in the wind.
[00:02:53] Oh, it's please walk to the front sir when there's trouble in the wind.
[00:02:59] You talk a better food for us and schools and fires and all.
[00:03:05] We'll rate for extra rations if you treat us rational.
[00:03:09] Don't mess about the cookroom slops but prove it to our face.
[00:03:14] The widows uniform is not the soldier's men's disgrace.
[00:03:20] For it's Tommy this and Tommy that and chuck him out the brute.
[00:03:25] But it's safe your other country when the guns begin to shoot.
[00:03:29] And it's Tommy this and Tommy that and anything you please.
[00:03:33] And Tommy ain't a blooming fool.
[00:03:36] You bet that Tommy sees.
[00:03:45] And that is another poem from Kippling.
[00:03:52] It's actually one of my favorites from Kippling.
[00:03:57] And you can follow it and you can go back and read through it,
[00:04:02] look it up online and it's explaining how the soldier doesn't get me respect during peace time.
[00:04:11] But when it's time to fight, when the troop ship is on the tide,
[00:04:17] then it's Tommy, which is slang for the British soldier, then it's Tommy to the front of a line.
[00:04:22] But the point that I wanted to focus on is the line in the poem where it says,
[00:04:32] and if sometimes our conduct is in all your fancy paints,
[00:04:39] why single men and barracks don't grow into plaster saints.
[00:04:42] And what that means is that soldiers and marines and sailors and those men that go out
[00:04:52] into harm's way voluntarily, they're not always boy scouts.
[00:04:59] They're not going to be plaster saints.
[00:05:00] You know plaster saint, like you have, the little statue of a saint of a Christian saint.
[00:05:07] The soldiers are going to be a little rough around the edges.
[00:05:10] They might be a little bit rowdy, they might be a little bit brash, they might be a little bit
[00:05:14] drunk, they might be trouble makers.
[00:05:16] Now they're not all like that, obviously.
[00:05:23] But some of them are.
[00:05:25] And guess what? Who else is going to go forward?
[00:05:30] Who else is going to go put their life on the line?
[00:05:36] It's these guys. And by the way, when you are raised in barracks,
[00:05:40] a single man in barracks, you're going to find some trouble from time to time.
[00:05:47] And then once you take these young men and you put them in a battle,
[00:05:52] once you subject them to fear and terror and death,
[00:05:59] can we assume now and expect them to act like saints?
[00:06:10] Can we somehow expect that their behavior is now going to transition to becoming beyond
[00:06:16] reproach in the way they carry themselves?
[00:06:21] I don't think that's a realistic outlook.
[00:06:23] Now the book that we're going to look at today is an example of war and it shows once again that war
[00:06:34] is brutal.
[00:06:38] Not just in actions, but also in attitude, in language.
[00:06:45] And in the way it impacts men both physically and mentally.
[00:06:50] And this book is raw, it's graphic, it's brutish and it's real.
[00:07:00] And the language that's in it, that's offensive. I leave it in.
[00:07:07] Why? Because war is offensive.
[00:07:11] And the language used in war is also offensive and if you don't want to hear offensive
[00:07:16] language or graphic descriptions or completely politically incorrect statements being made,
[00:07:24] then don't listen to this podcast. The book is called Excursion in Hell.
[00:07:36] And it tracks the experience of its author, or guy by the name of Vincent Bramley,
[00:07:45] who's a young corporal in third battalion of the British armies, parachute regimen,
[00:07:56] otherwise known as the three Paris.
[00:08:03] Now the book starts off kind of with the way the the Falkland Islands is starting to escalate
[00:08:11] and as it's starting to escalate, they get put on their England.
[00:08:16] The three Paris get put onto a cruise ship, a chartered cruise ship called the SS Cannebara
[00:08:24] and their sailing south towards the Falkland Islands. And now we, they're starting to get
[00:08:30] information, they're starting to get intelligence and start to get briefed on what's happening.
[00:08:34] Because these guys didn't even know where the Falkland Islands were. I mean, a lot of them,
[00:08:37] they didn't know where they were. Some random island out in the middle of nowhere. They couldn't
[00:08:41] find it on a map, a lot of them. Well now they're definitely looking at it and they're trying
[00:08:44] to figure out what's going on there. So, they're starting to get some of these briefs. We're going
[00:08:50] to the book now. Our lectures were in the early afternoon now. The most memorable was by some of the
[00:08:57] very keen Marines who had been serving in the Falklands at the time of the invasion.
[00:09:01] The Falkland Islands were in a British, I guess you'd call it a colony, but not a colony. It's
[00:09:09] a little British, it was owned by the British at the time. And the Argentinians invaded it.
[00:09:18] So, here we go. Obviously, listening to first-hand experience was better than listening to
[00:09:27] some officer lecturing us on his personal beliefs at the time. However, an intelligence officer
[00:09:33] from way up top gave a graphic account of what the RGs that's what they call the Argentinians. The
[00:09:38] RGs were up to at the time. The intelligence constantly coming in was essential to all levels.
[00:09:46] What I remember most about this lecture was the officer standing proudly in front of us saying
[00:09:51] the Argentin Army is the best and strongest in South America. He told us you will be in for a big
[00:09:58] scrap if it comes to war jense. Have no qualms about it. At the last recorded reports,
[00:10:04] the RGs have about 9,000 men in fortified positions around Stanley, the capital.
[00:10:11] But we also have good reports that they are underfed, Morales low, and they have taken a eating
[00:10:17] horses and sheep, which they have been stealing from the inhabitants. That's the local people
[00:10:23] that lived on the Falkland Islands. This tells us that they are very undisciplined and goes to
[00:10:29] show that conscription is going to be their mistakes. So, they have some of their soldiers are
[00:10:34] conscripts, meaning they're forced into the army. Like a draft? Like, yes. My immediate feelings
[00:10:43] were 9,000 fucking men, and we only have 2 or 3,000. What the fuck is the big brass up to?
[00:10:54] So, what was interesting about this is one of the things that I really
[00:10:58] this reminded me of is these guys have never been to work before. That matter fact he doesn't even
[00:11:03] mention anyone that has any prior combat experience. So, this reminds me of when I was on all my
[00:11:10] first deployments. Like, I talked about being off the coast of Somalia. I talked about being off
[00:11:15] the coast of Rwanda. And that's the position that these guys were in. And what our mindset was,
[00:11:21] if I was to go into Rwanda when I was a kid, when I was, you know, however old I was 22 years old,
[00:11:27] never been in combat before, I would be completely different person than if I went in right now
[00:11:32] with my, you know, all the things that we talked about all the time. I mean, I would be, I just
[00:11:36] understand combat. I understand Warbetter. I'm 45 years old. I've been in combat leadership positions,
[00:11:44] been in fire fights. I understand these things. It might add it to you to be completely different.
[00:11:51] Almost completely different than it would be than it was when I was 22 or 23 years old,
[00:11:59] sitting there fired up with a million rounds. And, you know, it's like, Lave talking, I've ever,
[00:12:03] you know, getting ready to go into Somalia or Rwanda, I had like hundreds of pounds of gear,
[00:12:08] grenades. We were so loaded. I was too heavy. Because we're, if I were going to World War 3.
[00:12:14] And that's the, that's what these guys are like. They don't, they're, they're, they're,
[00:12:19] they just don't, they never in a combat. And I think, you know, everything. Yeah, they're trying to be
[00:12:24] ready for everything. And, and just their attitude, and you can see it actually carries through
[00:12:28] this thing is almost like, and this is what he says too. A lot of times it's almost like they're on
[00:12:34] this giant, really hard training exercise. Obviously it turns very,
[00:12:40] sour at some points and very much, much more beyond that. But this is what a lot of this reminds
[00:12:47] me of these guys. Now, some of these guys have been in, I guess the combat experience that these
[00:12:52] guys would have had, and I, and I should have remembered this. I didn't, you know what these guys
[00:12:55] had combat experience, they had combat experience from being in Northern Ireland. So most of them
[00:12:59] had done deployments over in the Northern Ireland. But I think that was a little bit more of a,
[00:13:05] not, it's not, it's not the full kind of combat that are about to get engaged in here. So,
[00:13:12] that's what it reminds me of here in the way they're talking. All right. So, back to the book on
[00:13:20] three May the submarine HMS conquer sank the Argentinian ship general Belgrano with a loss of about
[00:13:29] 300 lives. When this news was first brought to us, we were skeptical thinking, yeah, okay.
[00:13:37] Once the news was official, it wasn't greeted with total enthusiasm. In the bar that night,
[00:13:42] most of us were solemn. We now knew war was inevitable. They have a bar. It's a cruise ship that
[00:13:50] they're on. So they have a bar and they're drinking. They're getting some allotment of beers in there.
[00:13:53] That's where they're hanging out. But all of a sudden this is real. You know, you don't kill 300,
[00:13:58] you know, enemy sailors and think you're not going to go to war. And it comes back back to the
[00:14:03] book the night of four May while we were playing Bingo in the bar. News came that the HMS
[00:14:09] Sheffield had been hit by an RG exeset, which is a type of missile and was sinking. The loss of a
[00:14:15] hair your jet was also reported. The news hit the troops on board like a sledgehammer.
[00:14:21] Until now, everything we had heard had been in our favor. South Georgia had been retaken and the
[00:14:26] RG's submarine patrol boats had all been hit even their inland positions had been bombed by the navy
[00:14:32] and now the Belgrano, which was the ship that it sunk, sinking the Sheffield was the first of
[00:14:38] their strike backs. Moral in the bar that night swung from an incredible high to an almost
[00:14:45] sickening silence. And he talks about this, but the waiting, these guys are now,
[00:14:53] it's a long cruise down there. I think it takes about three or three weeks to get down.
[00:14:58] Back to the book, the day after the Sheffield's hit, we knew our weight was coming to an end.
[00:15:03] The atmosphere was quiet and a morale booster was now much needed. The only thing possible for the task
[00:15:08] force was revenge. The sinking of the Sheffield had hit us as if we had lost a personal friend,
[00:15:15] tension mounted, frustration showed in everyone's eyes. The fitness drills were now carried out
[00:15:21] in full kit and pounding the decks in the heat was gutty work. So the whole time they've been
[00:15:26] steaming down there, they've been out there running laps on the all the deck of the cruise,
[00:15:31] ship trying to get in shape for what's coming. Back to the book, the main info we picked up
[00:15:40] suggested a possible move on 20 May. So they're trying to figure out what's going on. They're
[00:15:45] down. These guys, you know, pretty low on the total pull, they're trying to figure out what's going
[00:15:49] on. They're hearing all these different rumors and now they picked up that maybe they're going to
[00:15:52] go on 20 May. Back to the book, our nerves now started. The move south was steady and without any
[00:15:58] real complications, but further south we went, the further we were going in. Somehow, I and many others
[00:16:06] still didn't quite believe the war was going to happen. We were lost in our own thoughts on many
[00:16:11] different subjects. Home became secondary now. I thought about the ifs and winds of our arrival
[00:16:17] in the exclusion zone and to the landings and battles to follow. Home was not my immediate thoughts.
[00:16:23] Survival was speculation was now rife as to what the landing procedure would be. We were still
[00:16:33] very much in the dark as to what was happening. But the next within the next 24 hours, all the bullshed,
[00:16:39] rumors and personal beliefs were corrected by the platoon commander. Gents, he said,
[00:16:45] it's the green light. So they know they're now going in. And now they're getting
[00:16:53] into the serious preparations, packing and repacking to make our webbing as comfortable as possible.
[00:16:59] We began to psych ourselves up for the days ahead. It was nerve-racking beyond belief.
[00:17:04] Yet morale seemed remarkably high throughout the ship, though the laughing and joking among the
[00:17:09] lads was partly to cover the fear. Not that anyone thought death was going to hit him. That was
[00:17:15] for the guy you were talking to. Getting the common belief that the common belief that we hear
[00:17:21] quite a bit, which is not going to happen to me. And I will say this as I say it for all these
[00:17:30] shows that we do. I'm skipping a bunch of stuff. I'm giving you some of the high points, but the
[00:17:37] way he lays this out, the tension that he builds, he does an outstanding job,
[00:17:42] getting the tension and capturing it. And I'm going through it pretty quickly, but it's worth reading
[00:17:48] because, and I think it's worth reading because if you're in one of these situations,
[00:17:52] especially when you're in charge of guys that have never been to combat before, this is what you
[00:17:55] got to, it gives you a good lessons about keeping guys informed about preparing them for combat
[00:18:03] and keeping them with the right mindset going in. So now they actually transfer from the cruise ship
[00:18:09] now they get onto a warship and eventually they end up on a landing craft. That's, that's
[00:18:13] heading to shore because they're going to war. Again, I covered that what in six minutes right now,
[00:18:20] it's, it's much more well detailed in the book. But right now they're getting ready to
[00:18:26] do their landing. Back to the book. The area now looked like an overcrowded tube train. The
[00:18:32] troops had pushed so close together that you could count the blackheads on your neighbor's face.
[00:18:36] I sat on my kit observing the order to keep all noise down, no talking.
[00:18:41] I looked around, I looked around me at the hundreds of cammed faces so they got cammed camouflage
[00:18:48] paint on at hundreds of cammed faces all with big wide eyes. Each face told its own story.
[00:18:55] Each, each soldier had his own thoughts about the coming battle and the lads as the
[00:19:01] lads quietly sat about waiting, always waiting. The story of all soldiers.
[00:19:06] Myself, I couldn't help but think that it was still a joke and that we wouldn't be going to
[00:19:12] shore. My stomach was not and the nauseous, hard to control. The nervousness running through
[00:19:18] me was the worst of all waiting, waiting for that fucking green light.
[00:19:24] Doc Murdock, Doc Murdock sat next to me pulling faces like a comedian. Fuck off, Doc, I said,
[00:19:30] I've got the gidders. We've all got to go somewhere, then, don't worry. The frustration of waiting
[00:19:40] and all the hassles of the last six weeks disappeared as we watched in stunned silence.
[00:19:45] The battle for fanning head to our left. Fanning head was the RGOP near San Carlos.
[00:19:52] The SAS had mounted an attack there to allow our landings to go ahead without interference.
[00:19:57] The tracer rounds and naval bombardment on the tip of the bay brought us abruptly into the
[00:20:02] real world. Jesus, look at that. It's a fireworks display shouted a lad at the front of the craft.
[00:20:10] Shut up and face the coming beach. We hadn't noticed we were moving towards the beach. All heads
[00:20:15] had been turned to watch the battle. So that's a little wake-up call. They're going into
[00:20:20] do their beach landing and there's a massive firefight going on where the SAS is doing a hit. Now,
[00:20:29] as they get on, they do their landing their landing is on a post and they're starting to
[00:20:34] patrol movement towards one of their objectives. Here we go. When we passed San Carlos,
[00:20:43] two gazelle helicopters had just been shot down by some of the fleeing enemy.
[00:20:48] Word very quickly went around that the crew had been shot in the water while trying to swim
[00:20:54] ashore. Our anger brought home the reality of war and introduced us to the type of enemy we would
[00:21:00] be fighting. I would personally felt that if we could have caught those responsible,
[00:21:07] we would have killed them for the cowardly act. So there's some,
[00:21:16] well, cowardly acts. I guess is the word used. So the guys are trying to swim to safety and
[00:21:23] they get shot in helicopter pilots. They get into a position and they they hold up for a while
[00:21:31] in a security position. Back to the book, guard sat behind the SF gun for two hours on,
[00:21:38] for off, there's no sleep to be had. What with the cold rain, ponchos,
[00:21:45] flapping all over the place and everyone restlessly changing positions all the time.
[00:21:50] It was a great first night. So they're out there, they're freezing. It's, that's one thing. They
[00:21:56] weren't really prepared for, they weren't really prepared for this cold weather.
[00:22:00] And, but that's how they kick off. No enemy contact yet other than what they can see off in the
[00:22:08] distance. They get gathered up for a little morning meeting. Back to the book, Pete Gray,
[00:22:17] gathered the NCOs around him for a daily brief and informed us of the things we weren't interested in.
[00:22:23] But also informed us that A company and C company had had a blue on blue sometime earlier.
[00:22:29] Apparently, both companies had patrols out to look for the RGs who had escaped on our landing.
[00:22:37] One patrol had spotted the other and asked for mortars on their position seen.
[00:22:42] In turn, the other company asked for artillery on the first company.
[00:22:46] So a battle between A company and C company both firing small arms at each other.
[00:22:51] Within minutes, the operations officer in charge realized the arrow, error, and radioed for a ceasefire.
[00:23:00] But not before three to four lads and been badly shot up to them suffering head wounds.
[00:23:08] The ops officer was temporarily removed from the task. So again, we got relatively unexperienced
[00:23:16] guys. They're out there and again, obviously I highlight that because blue on blue is real thing.
[00:23:25] And people don't think it's going to happen. I think Laf was talking about this.
[00:23:29] If you would have asked someone in T.U. Bruser,
[00:23:33] he said, one of the chances that we're going to have a blue on blue on our deployment. People would have
[00:23:38] been like zero percent. They would have the zero percent because it was that, that's that taboo.
[00:23:43] And the fact that, you know, there's a blue on blue that we talk about in extreme ownership,
[00:23:49] but there's blue on blues all the time in our body. And this is another example of how easy it is
[00:23:57] to have it happen between two companies in the same battalion.
[00:24:00] Hmm. Back to the book, well lads, bad news said Pete, the Atlantic conveyor has been sunk.
[00:24:15] How the fuck did that get hit as someone from the rear? You tell me,
[00:24:20] Pete wasn't a happy man nor were we for the ship had been carrying the chinooks and luxury
[00:24:25] kit like tents, overboots and so on. So there was a supply ship, well a ship that had a bunch of
[00:24:34] supplies on it, including helicopters and helicopters was what's supposed to transport the
[00:24:39] Paris around Falkland. That was the plan. That just got sunk. And not only to get sunk with the
[00:24:44] helicopter's on it, it got sunk with the things like tents and sleeping bags that's going to allow
[00:24:49] them to be, you know, operate comfortably in this cold environment. If you don't know where
[00:24:55] Falkland Islands is, it's down by Antarctica. Back to the book, some bastard should fall for this.
[00:25:03] We thought all that kit on one bloody ship. Bad news of our choppers being sunk hit us
[00:25:10] sorely and many of us were still thinking about it when Pete announced the next info. No choppers.
[00:25:16] So the big wigs have decided that we start walking ASAP like today. Pete gave us a break
[00:25:24] down of what was happening. Two parah was on the march to Goose Green. 45 commander were
[00:25:30] were to head north to a settlement called Douglas. We of three parah were to take Tiel inlet.
[00:25:38] Within an hour, all kit was packed tightly away. Last meals and bruised demolished, weapons
[00:25:44] oiled and ready and bunkers evacuated. Bruise. He's talking about tea.
[00:25:50] And the brits, if you don't know, they like their tea. It's epic. And I saw that with brits that I've
[00:26:01] worked with, obviously, I'm married to a brit, so I know how much they like tea and drink tea.
[00:26:07] I saw it overseas. Guys would be ready to brew tea at any given time. The first people
[00:26:13] the Sri Lankan, when I was working with the Sri Lankan guys back in the burr of Kronin. They
[00:26:19] have had the influence by the British army and by the British culture. Because that was a
[00:26:24] British settlement for a long time. They got their tea on too. They would brew any, you know,
[00:26:30] you need to take a break for 10 minutes. These guys would be over there with a little stove,
[00:26:34] little hex lamp brewing up a tea. So that's something that you're going to, and I'm talking
[00:26:40] about it now. I don't highlight as much as I could in this podcast, but that's what they're talking about.
[00:26:46] Having a cup of tea. Yeah, doing a brew. When I worked with guys, the SAS guys that would
[00:26:53] come and stay with us here, those guys were the same way. Get the brew tea on. Yeah, got to have
[00:26:58] the guy that had a cup of tea. Solid. Back to the book, we made our way up the prominent part
[00:27:08] of windy gap where most of the baton was gathering. The CSM, that's the command sergeant major
[00:27:13] of B company was organizing which kit we were to carry and which to leave. No tried, no trypots
[00:27:20] for the SF guns and the SF guns are sustained fire guns. Basically a big heavy machine gun.
[00:27:26] That that takes a crew to operate. So you have a tripod. Someone cares the tripod. Someone cares
[00:27:32] the gun. Someone cares the ammunition. At least I think that's how they break it up.
[00:27:36] No trypots for the SF guns and no sleeping bags. No burdens. Bergen's is what the Brits
[00:27:42] call their big backpack or big rucksacks. All unnecessary weight to be left. We repacked our kit.
[00:27:50] The Bergen's and Tripods were centralized for a later pick-up. They were to be choppered
[00:27:55] forward if a chopper became available. We all felt pissed off about the conveyor being sunk
[00:28:02] and the prospect of the coming tab. So they call a march or hump they call it a tab.
[00:28:09] We were pissed off about the coming tab. We knew that the march would be about 50 kilometers.
[00:28:21] But we were all glad to be moving breaking out across the island on the offensive. We set out at about
[00:28:27] two-thirty in the afternoon on what was to be an epic march for the regiment.
[00:28:30] With the GPMG, that's a general purpose machine gun. Weeping order and ammo slung over
[00:28:39] every part of our bodies, we tabbed or rather hobbled as fast as we could.
[00:28:45] Once over the first hill we started to march around the side of an adjoining hill.
[00:28:49] At this time the Marines were walking alongside us ready to break northwards toward Douglas
[00:28:54] towards the Douglas settlement. Unlike us, they carried full kit, Bergen's and all.
[00:28:58] Within 30 minutes we had a short break to let the stragglers catch up. A young Marine was
[00:29:04] propped on his back beside me with his Bergen as a support. You lot have the right idea he said.
[00:29:09] No fucking extras. We look like donkeys here. I couldn't help but agree with him. But thought
[00:29:16] to myself that while we may move faster we'd be coldest at night. At that time I didn't
[00:29:21] know we'd be marching flat out all the way day and night. In less than an hour our bodies were
[00:29:31] struggling under the weight of kit and ammo. The GPMG seemed away at ton. We swapped it on every
[00:29:38] short break within the first two hours. The night march orders were passed slowly back along the
[00:29:43] length of the battalion that we'd be stopping for 15 minutes in every hour. Some even started clock
[00:29:49] watching. Our boots and wet socks were becoming unbearable to march in rubbing badly on the feet
[00:29:56] most. If not all of us. Blisters and spraying ankles added unexpectedly to the injury tool.
[00:30:04] I haven't done a good job of describing the terrain. It's miserable terrain. Just rocks,
[00:30:10] slippery rocks, big steep hills. It's go look at it on, you look at some images of what the terrain
[00:30:18] in the Falkland Islands is like. It's nightmare to patrol along. It's going to snow.
[00:30:26] It's not snowing yet but it's going to snow. It's actually in some ways worse. It's
[00:30:34] worse to have because if it's cold enough that it's snowing snow is generally dry. If that makes
[00:30:41] sense rain is rain. You get rained on your wet. If you get snowed on you can maintain your
[00:30:49] dryness. If you're in a really cold environment where it's snowing that's okay. It doesn't make
[00:30:54] you wet and wet makes you cold. It's the worst thing is right on that borderline between
[00:31:03] because then you get rained on but then when the sun goes down it turns into freezing. So this is the worst
[00:31:07] worst environment you could want for the situation that they're in and all they're given. They
[00:31:14] only have what limited gear they should have got sunk on a boat or it's in their burdens but
[00:31:21] even the stuff that's in their burdens isn't the best winter equipment they would want. All that
[00:31:26] stuff got sunk. So he's got a guy that's starting to slack a little bit. His name is Taft.
[00:31:39] Taft moved up. Move up by screamed. I can't vent some fucked. I was losing my rag. I could see
[00:31:45] he was out of it but I couldn't stand the fact that he was going to let us down before we'd even
[00:31:49] got there. Taft was trying to keep up and mumbling out loud that he could do it if only we were
[00:31:54] to slow down a little bit but this was impossible. Nobody could tell the lead elements to slow down.
[00:32:00] The gap got bigger, the swearing got louder. Taft wasn't the only one to feel the strain.
[00:32:06] Many of the lads were struggling. At last exhausted we stopped on the slope of yet another wind swept
[00:32:13] hill. Taft shook uncontrollably. He had a bad cramp and lay there totally out of the game.
[00:32:20] I informed the medics. Steve was sitting beside his usual when the unusual order came from the
[00:32:29] CO. The commanding officer. Brew up a hot cup of and make a snack. That was the order.
[00:32:36] This shocked a lot of us. Theoretically it was a no-no sitting in the middle of an advance
[00:32:40] in the open and pitch dark practically though. It was the best order yet. A welcome brew was
[00:32:46] what we needed. The CO was obviously aware that the lads were suffering from the speed of the march.
[00:32:53] To me, Taft looked as though he was about to die. His nine stone frame wasn't strong enough
[00:32:59] for the rest of the march. Taft could run the British, the army's British fitness test in
[00:33:04] around eight minutes and was considered our best runner. This proves as do other accounts I heard
[00:33:11] after the war that the fitness of troops cannot be determined by how fast they can run.
[00:33:17] The peros always pride themselves on tabbing with kit. That means marching with gear.
[00:33:22] And rightly so. But I learned to lesson on our first night's march. You must have body fat on
[00:33:29] you to waste for that kind of long tab that we had embarked on. So got a guy that's like,
[00:33:35] you know, a super thin triathlete. Now he's now you put a bunch of weight on him.
[00:33:39] He's hurting. And I'll tell you that that also, that's a generalization too. That's not a waste
[00:33:47] too. I know some guys that were lean and could run fast and they could also haunt the rock. Like it was
[00:33:53] there, like it was there business. Now they start gathering up kind of the guys that
[00:34:00] can't continue and they lead, they actually leave these guys that can't continue in a
[00:34:05] perimeter area. And then we're going back to the book. We slogged it out for another two or three
[00:34:11] hours of continuous hills, bogs, rocks, holes in the ground, everything that we could possibly,
[00:34:17] everything that could possibly make you trip or get wet. On top of the bloody awful terrain,
[00:34:23] we had the rain, sleet, wind and freezing climate to cope with. Exhausted and near the point of
[00:34:30] collapse, we came to the first man-made thing I'd seen, apart from the small houses at San Carlos.
[00:34:36] It was a barbed wire fence. There, right in the middle of nowhere, sat the fence,
[00:34:41] stretching far into the darkness on either side. Orders from above, told us to rest up until first
[00:34:46] light. We had been marching for 15 hours across the worst terrain you could imagine.
[00:34:52] Stephen, I attached our poncho with bunges, our ponchos with bunges to the fence and skitty,
[00:34:59] cave and johnny bashed up on the other side, creating a tent like accommodation. That's like
[00:35:04] their term for making shelter. We'd call it Bivvy Up, which is where we're going to sleep. They
[00:35:10] call it Bashed Up. We'd say Bivvy Up, here. We're going to Bivvy Up here. The rain hard for
[00:35:17] the remaining four hours of darkness. The wind blew the rain in on us as we all lay there trying
[00:35:23] to rest in the Bashar. But although we were exhausted, someone snoring, soon broken to my thoughts
[00:35:29] and outside around the Bashar little whispers could be heard, and other voices shouting for silence.
[00:35:36] I closed my eyes dreaming of a bath, clean sheets, and a letter from home. I didn't mind the
[00:35:41] rain as it hit my face. The chance to rest was welcome and I eventually managed to sleep.
[00:35:46] I was a woken by a nudge from skitty, who was already half packed and ready to move.
[00:35:51] Steve and I crawled from our refuge and quietly packed our kit into our webbing.
[00:35:57] The rain and cold had shrunk the webbing so that it was difficult to fasten.
[00:36:02] Cold and numbness had us swearing out loud. We tapped over more hills,
[00:36:10] through more bogs and marshes. My legs ached more than I had fought possible. Steve was,
[00:36:17] if anything, better than me with the weight. Every time I started to struggle with the GPMG,
[00:36:23] he took it without complaining. Kary that weapon he could.
[00:36:29] So brutal march, they get to their next destination where they're going into a lay-up point or a
[00:36:36] perimeter where they're going to stop for a while. Back to the book, my stomach felt hollow.
[00:36:40] The wind and rain drain me of life. Lying there, feeling near to total exhaustion,
[00:36:46] I couldn't even think of what was to come. The battle for Tiel inlet. My feet didn't exist any more.
[00:36:52] They were just two blocks of numbed ice attached to my legs, tapping them together, brought a
[00:36:57] pain that felt as if they would shatter and fall off. Steve lay next to me, lighting up a
[00:37:04] fag, which is a cigarette. He looked up through the rain clouds at the dark and sky.
[00:37:09] If we carry on at this rate, we'll all drop that of exhaustion he murmured. Steve said
[00:37:17] that he didn't want to look at his feet because they felt like they were falling off. I peeled
[00:37:21] back my wet socks, saw blood on my right foot and discovered that the nail of my big toe was hanging
[00:37:27] off. Numbness had masked, what normally would have been agony. Cleunching my teeth, I pulled the nail
[00:37:33] away by its remaining roots. Soon, the shot went out that we were to get ready to move. We
[00:37:44] were moving earlier than expected to catch the last of the daylight. When I stood up, my body
[00:37:49] ached from head to foot. I was minus one toenail. I took up my kit and moved into line with the
[00:37:55] others ready to go the last 13 kilometers to Tiel. So far to take us about 14 hours to March
[00:38:02] 40 odd kilometers. That was still good going. We set off very slowly spaced out in one long line.
[00:38:12] We hobbled over the hill in front of us only to see more hills and marshes. I began to become
[00:38:18] conscious of my toe and the more I thought about it, the worse it felt. However, the thought of
[00:38:24] dropping out at that stage seemed to fate worse than death and so I fought the pain. It's funny,
[00:38:31] looking back, but the further we went into the campaign, the less I thought of my home or family.
[00:38:38] I wasn't thinking of Queen and Country either. I fought of myself and the lads around me.
[00:38:45] Letting the side down was my biggest fear. That fear kept me walking.
[00:38:55] Just doesn't want to let his boys down.
[00:38:56] That's his driving force, not even thinking about his family anymore. Not thinking about God and
[00:39:02] Country. Not thinking about the Queen.
[00:39:09] Here's a little thing that I had to highlight. We were annoyed by the lack of info coming down the
[00:39:14] marching line to Tielus where we were and how far we had left the march. This is as the last
[00:39:19] night learned a long time ago. When I was a young junior guy in a pontoon and if you're in the
[00:39:26] back of the pontoon or you're in the back of the patrol and you don't know where you're going,
[00:39:28] it is the worst feeling. It's the worst feeling. You have no idea how much longer, where you're
[00:39:33] going, where you are. Not only is it a bad feeling for the people on your team. It's tactically
[00:39:40] unsound because they don't know where they are. What happens if you get contact, you get split up,
[00:39:43] where they're supposed to go, they don't even know where they're. What if they're going the wrong
[00:39:46] directions? They could get going to enemy formation. It's a horrible scenario.
[00:39:51] Obviously, as a leader in any position, you gotta think, does the back of your patrol know where
[00:39:58] you are? Does your company know where you are? I was working with a company recently. They had
[00:40:02] that big transition to make. No one knew what quantified that transition. It just seemed like this
[00:40:10] open-ended prospect and no one knew where it ended or what quantified, hey, we can move to the next phase.
[00:40:18] It was a tough phase that they were going through. Cutting costs and being restrictive on
[00:40:24] expenditures, I guess that is cutting costs, but getting rid of some people is a tough time.
[00:40:31] But no one knew when that was going to end. They knew that there was some kind of go-off
[00:40:36] there, but they didn't know what it was. That was really tough for them in the transition.
[00:40:40] I said, you need to set clear goals. If you know what they are, which is actually the leadership
[00:40:44] did know, they knew there was a certain line, a certain amount of costs that they needed to cut
[00:40:49] a certain operating expense that they needed to get down to, but they didn't tell anybody.
[00:40:55] So everyone just thought, well, we might just be cutting my job next or who, you know,
[00:40:59] how long am I going to be here? If we're just shutting down, I don't know. So keep your people
[00:41:04] informed. The people that are in the back end of your patrol, you gotta keep them informed.
[00:41:10] Back to the book, we came to a fourth river smaller than the rest and stumbled across
[00:41:14] it in the dark. The cold water mixed with our sweat to cause yet more sores on our feet.
[00:41:21] We were now about one and a half kilometers from the settlement of Tiel inlet.
[00:41:26] The agony of the marching disappeared quickly as it became clear that the task of the battle
[00:41:31] would soon confront us.
[00:41:35] And how does that go? One and a half hours of lying in the cold with the wind shooting through us
[00:41:41] was all the action they had that night. So they get to Tiel and Lett and really nothing really
[00:41:45] happens because the RGs had left. They do get some updates. Back to the book, we found out that
[00:41:53] some of the platoon had dropped out on the march. More importantly, though, Mick Coleman, one of our
[00:41:58] gunners had just been shot in the leg, not by the enemy, but by a knob in a company. So their first,
[00:42:07] you know, casualty besides someone getting hurt from marching is something that gets shot,
[00:42:12] one of my one of their own people. It's a knob just in a derogatory term for a tool.
[00:42:20] A turtleneck. It's not a military turn. It's not a official military
[00:42:29] doctrinal term knob. Just say a turt. The CO and his back to the book. The CO and his band of
[00:42:40] followers and spectatilines later that morning. So now they're dug in another position. We thought
[00:42:44] they might instruct us to move our trench or something. The usual thing, but we were still thinking
[00:42:49] is that we were on exercise. So classic point right there, the commanding officer comes around and
[00:42:54] they think, oh, he's going to tell us to redig these trenches because that's what we'd be doing
[00:42:57] if we were on exercise. Hey, you need to move this over here. That could be a little bit better.
[00:43:00] It doesn't do any of that. The CO looked grim as he approached the six of us taking a tea break.
[00:43:09] Listen in lads said the RSM. That's the regimental sergeant major. We looked at him wondering what was
[00:43:16] coming. During the March, two parrots. So that's their sister battalion. Two parrots attacked
[00:43:23] goose green and Darwin settlements. After a long battle, the regiment liberated the settlement
[00:43:30] with the loss of 18 lives, including their commanding officer Colonel H Jones.
[00:43:37] Many have been wounded and a casualty list is being drawn up. They captured hundreds of
[00:43:43] arches. The war is now a different concept for the enemy are believed to have shot down members of
[00:43:50] two parrots showing a white flag. More information will be given once known.
[00:43:59] The CO have smiled and proceeded to the next line of partly dubbed trenches.
[00:44:06] Skitty, Kev, John and I looked at each other with open mouths.
[00:44:11] The fought of 18 members of two parrots dead outweighed the victory for us.
[00:44:16] I for one couldn't have given a shit about goose green or anywhere else on the island at that time.
[00:44:26] It was a thought of losing our mates in the sister battalion that worried me.
[00:44:33] So they think they've got it bad. But this other battalion had been an a serious gunfight
[00:44:40] and taken some pretty significant casualties including losing their leader, the leader of the battalion.
[00:44:53] Back to the book, the condition of our feet was becoming a major problem for the battalion.
[00:44:58] An old complaint suffered by troops during many wars was afflicting us in modern war,
[00:45:04] trench foot. Our boots, badly and cheaply made coupled with our old fashioned socks and putties
[00:45:13] caused this condition and putties are like, let me have you ever seen those old kind of school
[00:45:18] world war one. They're like leggings or like gators. No gators are. They kind of cover your shoes.
[00:45:25] They kind of cover your boots. It was characterized by a dull, fumping ache all over the
[00:45:33] foot with blueness at the edges. Some say it's similar to frostbite, which some lads also got.
[00:45:43] Now they hold up for the night and then as he's sleeping, we get this corpal bee corpal bee.
[00:45:51] That's who we're talking about right now. That's Vince, Vince Bramley,
[00:45:54] he's the column corpal bee a bunch. Corpal bee a voice whispered into the trench.
[00:45:59] Steve and I came around together. I looked up to see four platoons officer looking down at me.
[00:46:05] Yes, sir, I replied. Vince isn't it? Yes, sir. Being asked your first name wasn't unusual
[00:46:11] between officers and men in the field. Sorry old boy, bad news for you. In my half sleep,
[00:46:16] I couldn't think of anything worse than being woken up. Or just from the boss. We're pulling
[00:46:21] out at first light and marching to a stansia. He said, a stansia, where the fuck is that I asked?
[00:46:27] It was another 30 to 50 kilometers away towards Stanley. We learned. Stanley again is the capital.
[00:46:34] Steve and I looked at each other. As we sat, the bottom of our trench too numb to speak.
[00:46:40] I broke the silence first. This is getting fucking stupid, Steve. March here, dig there. We're dropping
[00:46:46] down like flies and now more. Do we're die marching without resting? Steve started laughing at my
[00:46:54] morning. His teeth shining in the dark. What are you so happy about? I said, just thought of
[00:47:00] more pain for the cause. Pain. Jesus, he was right. My feet would die before me. I thought,
[00:47:08] as I drifted back to sleep, I thought of my old corporal who trained me,
[00:47:13] corporal daring. We hated him for his hard methods. He used to say, pain doesn't matter. The mine
[00:47:19] does the work. He was right. So right. His voice was screaming in my ears now four years later.
[00:47:27] It was going to be mind over matter. There is wisdom in the pair's training method.
[00:47:33] Methods. I thought briefly of my parents who over the years had had a rough time with my
[00:47:39] slobbish attitude. I had been in and out of all sorts of trouble before joining the army.
[00:47:44] I said to myself that if I died with a bullet in the head, at least it would be better than
[00:47:49] worrying them into an early grave with my attitude. But to drop out now and be branded a
[00:47:55] wanker would be unbearable. I owe a lot to everyone. My old NCO, my parents, and above all,
[00:48:04] to the lads around me. A pair of team cannot work without everyone giving their best.
[00:48:09] It's the lads you fight and work for. You come second.
[00:48:21] So obviously more patrolling, more boots, boots, boots, over the Falkland Islands,
[00:48:29] another 30 kilometers up and down, crappy terrain. Back to the book. We are now within the
[00:48:36] enemies artillery range. The CO has ordered that we will dig shell scraps for protection.
[00:48:43] No movement like walking around, etc. until ordered tomorrow. So now they're within
[00:48:49] enemy artillery range, which we don't like artillery around here. Not when it's coming towards us at
[00:48:56] least. They're taking a look at each other, seeing where they're at. Steven Tom will look to my
[00:49:04] feet wondering if I would be able to carry on. I found a bandage hidden in my webbing and
[00:49:09] cut it up to make small dressings for my blisters and toes. I thought the fresh air would do them
[00:49:15] help. Leaving my boots off that night was by leaving my boots off that night was to be my worst
[00:49:23] mistake so far. After a freezing cold and sleepless night, the morning light showed me
[00:49:29] two swollen feet and the hardest frozen pair of boots imaginable. Putting those boots back on
[00:49:37] was agony. We marched for about four hours until the whole battalion and rendezvoused.
[00:49:45] By the time we reached this point, I was nearly crying in pain. My hips had bad webbing burns
[00:49:52] and my feet were too raw blobs as I slumped against a peak, a peat bank, Jimmy Morham murmured
[00:50:00] that I looked like death warmed up. I felt like it too. Within two weeks, we looked like a
[00:50:10] ragged bone army. Our faces were drawn with a loss of weight. Our uniforms matted and soaked.
[00:50:16] Our boots were damaged and we were hungry for solid food. Despite all this, Morau was very
[00:50:22] high in the reassuring knowledge that we had marched and taken most of the island without a bottle
[00:50:28] or a loss of life so far. So they're making rapid progress. And they're not really coming
[00:50:33] up against the enemy. The enemies were treating it. Every time they roll into a place, they find
[00:50:37] remnants of where the enemy was or when they have intelligence that was the enemy was there,
[00:50:41] but the enemy is just leaving. So it's just them against nature. That's where it's been for the
[00:50:45] most part at this point. They keep pumping. We shuffled together and we were informed that we
[00:50:53] would be marching straight onto Mount Longden that night. The battle was about to begin. So this
[00:51:00] is a prominent piece of terrain called Mount Longden. We had no time for last letters or anything else.
[00:51:07] We packed our kit and were briefed and ready to go within two hours. The battalion formed up
[00:51:13] and marched uphill again, spilling out of the settlement towards the summit of Estancia.
[00:51:19] The route we took was atrocious. We crossed a rock field of some sort. The rocks were sharp and
[00:51:25] jagged. In four hours, we only covered three kilometers. Sweat ran down us like water. I stopped
[00:51:32] the one stage to take off my soaking long jones. We came to hold as the order turned back,
[00:51:39] turned back, hit our ears. What's the fucking matter now someone shouted? Just turn back and do as
[00:51:46] your told screamed in officer. Just on the other side of the hill, out of the view of Stanley, which
[00:51:51] is the capital, allowed the lads had been ordered back. Why? Shortly after, we learned that the
[00:51:58] cabbage heads. So they called, that's the Marines and there's Marines, Rome, Marines are down
[00:52:02] there working and running some of the major operations and they call them cabbage heads. Shortly after
[00:52:10] we learned that the cabbage heads were running the show, hadn't agreed to our advance. They didn't
[00:52:14] think we should take the risk of going into battle on our own. So the Marines wanted to be there.
[00:52:18] With them, so they said, don't go to long to yet. Back to the book, as we were milling around a
[00:52:29] peat fire with nine squadron, a chopper came down from one of the mountains. Some nosy lads ran
[00:52:35] towards an quickly brought back report that some Marines had been in a blue on blue contact that
[00:52:40] night. So another blue on blue, a returning patrol had stumbled upon a mortar-based team of sleep
[00:52:47] and it shot them as they lay in their sleeping bags. There were three to four dead.
[00:52:53] Whatever we felt about the Marines, we were sorry for them on that day. If you're out there
[00:53:02] and you use a gun for part of your job, whether you're in the police department, whether you're
[00:53:07] in a SWAT team, whether you're in the military, I'm telling you the blue on blue happens
[00:53:14] and you gotta do all you can to train for situations and always be aware that it can happen.
[00:53:20] People don't think it can happen. That's why it happens. Back to the book on 10 June, we had orders
[00:53:27] that something was going down soon. We stripped our weapons thoroughly, oil and oil,
[00:53:33] and greased them. The PC issued 50 rounds per gun for balancing. That's basically test firing
[00:53:42] and probably doing some kind of a timing drill on your weapon to make sure that it's good to go.
[00:53:47] Bob Gettison immediately balanced his gun by firing across the water, inlet into the sea.
[00:53:53] Tony Jones was just setting up his when the QM, that's a quarter-master guy in charge of
[00:53:57] supplies and logistics, came screaming over and ordered us not to waste ammo.
[00:54:02] We pointed out that the guns needed balancing, but his narrow mind wouldn't have it.
[00:54:08] He walked away pleased by the thought of saving ammo. In fact, he caused a major
[00:54:13] fuck up with all the guns in the battle. Only two of the six worked. 50 rounds through each might
[00:54:20] have saved lives and would have at least provided better firepower for the battalion.
[00:54:27] So you gotta guy, the supply guy, hey don't, don't test fire your weapons. Don't do that right now.
[00:54:34] Save the ammunition. Now they did realize that they were an ammunition shortage. That was going to be a
[00:54:38] problem, but you're not going to have an ammunition shortage if your guns don't work. Back to the
[00:54:45] book, the PC came down and we gathered round him eagerly. He stood faintly, grinning at us.
[00:54:52] Spitted out Sir, said Johnny Cook orders in a half an hour, tonight lads, green light.
[00:54:58] See you by the model in a half an hour. So, they're in the model. He's talking about they built
[00:55:04] a little terrain model so that they could kind of draw out where everyone's going, kind of go through
[00:55:11] the plan. And this is what they're talking about now is the assault on Mount Longden, which is about
[00:55:18] to begin. Begins with getting into position and finally they are in position. The assault
[00:55:28] is getting started. Things start going sideways pretty damn quickly. Back to the book. We tend
[00:55:33] Oliver rushed over to our position. Right, listen in he said, I felt like saying I was anyway,
[00:55:38] but for the time joking was over. Be company of had to change their tactics a bit.
[00:55:44] Corporals, Bramlies and Cook's teams will follow myself and Captain Mason into A company positions.
[00:55:50] While Corporal Tomo, Rawlings and Pears will go to another task. Okay, so things are going crazy.
[00:55:58] They start to move. He starts to move with Lieutenant Oliver towards this other position. Back to
[00:56:05] the book. We'd run about 200 meters. We were all still together, but now the run had become a fast
[00:56:10] stumbling walk. The noise of battle continued to grow. Continue to our right now as we moved around
[00:56:15] the slope. Suddenly a zipping sound whipped across my face. I didn't think anything of it as I walked
[00:56:21] and stumbled to keep up. Then three or four more zips hit the ground in front of in front and
[00:56:27] at my feet. I still carry on. I was walking behind Lieutenant Oliver. As I was walking behind Lieutenant
[00:56:34] Oliver, we saw bodies lying all over the place. I thought what the fuck are they doing lying there?
[00:56:40] Jesus Christ fucking lying there and we're struggling. I saw lad kneeling over a guy in a sleeping bag.
[00:56:47] I remember as I got to them just watching him. A low moaning was coming from the sleeping bag.
[00:56:53] I'd gone about 20 pieces when several more zips hit the ground sending a small shockwave all around me.
[00:57:01] For fuck's sake are you completely nuts or what some guy shouted? What?
[00:57:06] Ask Lieutenant Oliver. Do you know a sniper's picking at us? We stopped frozen solid in our
[00:57:12] trucks, then filled the ground. Our small column now joining the bodies lying all over the place.
[00:57:17] We'd walked into a company's form up where they had been stopped by a sniper.
[00:57:24] Lying there and hit me like a sledgehammer. The zips had been that had been missing me by inches.
[00:57:30] They were sniper fire. I lay there thinking you fucking idiot Vince.
[00:57:36] I cursed myself all the time. We lay there blaming myself for an unprofessional act. But then I'd never been
[00:57:42] shot at before. My mind had been so occupied with moving that the zipping sound seemed
[00:57:48] unconnected with the battle. So like I said first time being shot at and he didn't know what it was.
[00:57:56] I told this story on here before. The first time I got shot at,
[00:57:58] well the first time I was receiving fire was in the rum piece and I thought someone was going
[00:58:02] to cigarette out onto the road. I was like who the hell smoking in that home via enemy? But it was
[00:58:05] rounds hitting the Humvee. I was the same way. I was just like didn't it didn't occur to me.
[00:58:10] When it hit to you that their bullets are you like in shock or or do you just kind of shift into
[00:58:17] you know. Yeah, it's a game time. But it took me. It wasn't it was a pretty slow transition.
[00:58:24] You know, it took me to think through the whole process of who's smoking a cigarette.
[00:58:30] Wait, why are they throwing cigarettes? Wait, why do they have so many cigarettes?
[00:58:34] Where's the entire Humvee smoking a cigarette and putting them all out right now?
[00:58:38] And it wasn't like a massive volume of fire, but it was rounds hitting.
[00:58:42] Well, yeah. Can be won. Yeah, that's the answer. Wait, so you saw it on another Humvee in
[00:58:47] front of the Sparks. Yeah, I saw the Sparks on the ship. I thought. Yeah, so what's going on?
[00:58:52] Why someone's throwing cigarettes? Same same thing. I will say this though.
[00:58:57] When the first time I got shot at when I wasn't in the vehicle,
[00:59:01] you I heard the rounds going over and I knew what it was because I was used to it from when we do
[00:59:06] butts, I don't know how I'll explain it. When you shoot on a range, like when you go sight in your rifle,
[00:59:13] you shoot on the range and and some of us guys, you go down and you work the targets for the other
[00:59:19] guys. So you're in basically in a bunker kind of or you behind a big berm. Yeah. And you put the
[00:59:24] target up for your guys and then when they shoot at, you pull it back down, you mark it with these
[00:59:29] discs so that they know where their shots it so they can make adjustments and you put it back
[00:59:32] up again. So when you're doing that and you do it at different distances, they shoot from different
[00:59:38] distances, they shoot from 100 yards and they shoot from 300 yards and they shoot from 500 yards and
[00:59:42] they shoot from 800 yards. So you can just hear all these different ones and the further out they get
[00:59:46] the more you hear the actual sound of the round going over you. Right. And at certain ranges,
[00:59:52] you can hear a breaking the sound barrier and it's pretty loud. It's a crack more, but then when they
[00:59:57] get far enough away, you don't hear that anymore and it just sounds like he's talking about like a
[01:00:03] little zip, like a little, you know, but I knew it was the first time I ever got shot at,
[01:00:08] I knew exactly what it was. Yeah. It's crazy. I knew what was good. Well, that's the first time I got
[01:00:13] shot at not in a humbry. Right. And then in a humbry. Which by the way, I got shot at first. That was
[01:00:18] the first time I ever got shot at. Was it in the humbry? Yeah. All right, going back to the book,
[01:00:24] the battle was raging on the hill. Artillery shells were landing there, adding to the ricochet of bullets.
[01:00:31] If you slowly raised your head, you could watch the free firework display because that's what it
[01:00:36] looked like. The odd shout could be heard and the odd scream, but it was the sound of rifle
[01:00:41] machine gun and artillery that dominated the night. So we've gone from hay we're out on patrol and we're
[01:00:45] looking now they're in full. There's a full battle going on. After about an hour, we were all getting
[01:00:52] pissed off with this fucking sniper. Something had to be done and quick. He was holding up 130
[01:00:57] months. So these guys are pinned down. They're pinned down. And the idea was finding the plan that
[01:01:03] they come up with is they're going to use a malond called a malond. It's like a short range kind of
[01:01:10] it's like a bazooka, but it's wire guided so you can actually steer it a little bit. It's a missile,
[01:01:15] a little hand-carried missile. And that's the plan is to use that to shoot from where they think this
[01:01:21] sniper is shooting from. So they get in position, they get them malond in position, and then they're
[01:01:24] going to once they shoot with them malond, they're going to shoot their machine guns and add it.
[01:01:29] Stand by shouted captain Mason. My feet were forgotten. My mind empty to many thoughts,
[01:01:35] but my eyes were completely alive staring at the area of the fin. He's talking about this
[01:01:40] terrain feature that looks like a shark fin and possible target. Fire.
[01:01:44] Ginge let off the malond. The rocket rushed off the small portable frame and picked up
[01:01:51] its deadly speed. After 120 meters it was at its deadliest. We were only about 90 meters from the target.
[01:01:58] By the way, if you're sniper shooting at you from 90 meters, that is scary. He's not missing.
[01:02:04] Ginge managed to guide the wire missile to wire guide the missile on target.
[01:02:09] The explosion ripped into the night sending sparks everywhere. Bob pressed the trigger and
[01:02:14] are gunned burst to life for a few seconds. Then stopped. Stop it, screamed Bob. I tried to lift the
[01:02:21] feed the cover off the top of the GPMG, but the night sight was in the way. I ripped off the night
[01:02:28] sight from the weapon and threw it into sass's hands. It's another guy's sass. I cleared the gun
[01:02:33] and reloaded. Bob was just about to fire again when a zipping sound ripped into the ground right
[01:02:38] in front of our tripod. We both ducked behind the bank. The enemy's bullets whist over our heads
[01:02:44] and all around us. Ginge was laughing and shouted. They've seen you all right. Fucking brilliant
[01:02:49] isn't it? My night and the bloody guns packed up. Captain Mason shouted over from behind us.
[01:02:56] Reload. Reload. CS9 wants another one up there. So they wanted to hit again. We'll hit that sniper
[01:03:03] position to get with a me on which they do and they eventually take care of that problem and
[01:03:12] and are able to move on. Now they start coming back down from that supporting position because
[01:03:22] that's what they're doing is the most part they're assigned into supporting positions to get the
[01:03:26] high ground and support the assaultes they're happening. They come back down from that. We reach the
[01:03:31] bottom of the hill at about zero zero three zero hours. The battle had been going for some three
[01:03:37] and a half hours. We came up to the FAP. That's our first aid post and walk past the line of
[01:03:42] guys lying there moaning in half silence. The medics were busy with all the wounded. They're
[01:03:49] seem to be about 25 guys working and wounded in the group. We were sitting some 20 meters from them
[01:03:54] in the darkness and we could only just see the scene by the light of the moon. A sergeant from
[01:04:00] batalion HQ came over and told came over to us and they sent it all over and Captain Mason stood
[01:04:05] up to meet him. We have three confirmed dead at this moment. He said Murdock, Scott, and Greenwood.
[01:04:13] We know that are more but we can't get to them as yet. So Murdock, if you remember the guy that was
[01:04:17] making fun of making funny faces when they were on the boat coming in, confirmed dead. Their conversation
[01:04:24] continued around our coming task and that the RSM was coming to meet us. I sat in a trance. I
[01:04:32] couldn't believe that we had lost guys. Today it seems crazy that I should think like this. Why?
[01:04:38] I can only put it down to the fact that I was still in my own little world of make believe.
[01:04:42] We would win the war without getting anyone killed. The death of those three guys hit me like a brick
[01:04:48] total shock. Murdock were simply docked. docked who I'd been chatting with on the way to our
[01:04:56] start line after we bumped into B company now dead. Scotty from the MT Platoon. That's the motor
[01:05:04] transport Platoon. Like Greenwood recently nicknamed Fester because of his sleeping habits.
[01:05:11] My mind was blank to the conversation around me. Johnny nudged me. Vence were moving mate.
[01:05:17] This woke me to the reality of it all. I was now fully alert for Shirley that it was more to come.
[01:05:26] So now they're getting to another, like I said, their job has been doing supporting
[01:05:30] supporting arms, which is basically covering move on a big scale. That's what they're doing. You
[01:05:34] got to a group. This machine gun, Platoon, with the Milan, with the heavy machine guns,
[01:05:39] they're getting into elevated positions to cover for another element, another company, or another
[01:05:44] battalion to go in an assault target. This is classic cover move situation and they're in the
[01:05:49] cover position in most of these situations. And that's what's going on where we come back to the
[01:05:54] book. They're in another elevated firing position back to the book. Corporal B get ready.
[01:06:00] I waited for the command sergeant major to give the orders to fire. The weight was longer than I
[01:06:05] expected in my fingers stayed on the trigger frozen waiting. As I sat waiting for the command,
[01:06:11] other voices came to my ears from among the sounds of battle. The voices of the wounded.
[01:06:18] Everywhere their cries pitched in with those survivors still struggling and screaming
[01:06:23] frantically at each other to move their or move here. But the wounded were unlike anything else.
[01:06:31] Their cries could be heard above the uningered. Their shouts were desperate.
[01:06:35] My mind went blank. My eyes were wide open with fright for them.
[01:06:42] My mouth dried as I lay there. The second seemed like hours. Their anguished moaning and crying
[01:06:49] is here in my ears now as I write. No matter what eye or others did to try and ignore them,
[01:06:57] they somehow grew seemed to grow louder and louder. I burned with frustration. One victim
[01:07:06] who I later found out was bads bare it. Seems so near, groaning and shouting,
[01:07:12] help me, please don't leave me. For fuck's sake help, I can't move.
[01:07:19] Someone further along to our left called out for Christ's sake, I'm dying. Don't let them
[01:07:24] bury me here, please, please. I shouted out. Hang on, don't move, don't move. For fuck's sake,
[01:07:33] keep quiet. I started to crawl from my position. I wanted to help them.
[01:07:41] But to come and regret my arm. Leave it, corporal be. Leave it.
[01:07:46] I looked at him. Why? Because a sniper has already picked off about five or six guys that have
[01:07:55] tried to help, the top says no more. Okay? I slumped to the ground with a feeling of total helplessness.
[01:08:05] It was the worst feeling that anyone can imagine. As I tried not to think it was real,
[01:08:11] the cries continued. Oh God, I'm hitting the chest. I'm all wet. Please help.
[01:08:20] The crying went on and on. Some wounded guys had been dragged or had crawled away from the main
[01:08:28] impact area. Only to be pinned down elsewhere. My mind's seeth with anger.
[01:08:35] Corporal be, stand by the CSM screamed. The command to follow killed off all the cries and
[01:08:46] moaning. The weapon broke a stream of fire at the Argentinian positions three to five rounds
[01:08:52] bursting across the summit. The steady rate of fire continued as the CSM shouted across to change
[01:08:59] direction using our tracer rounds as indicators. All six guns opened up. Our tracers were
[01:09:05] ripped across the summit to the other end of the mountain. The bullets bouncing and ricocheting in all
[01:09:09] directions. So hammering the target, hammering the enemy from where the enemy is shooting and
[01:09:23] obviously, I mean, what a wretched description of being within the sound of the voices of your wounded
[01:09:30] man who you cannot help because they're pinned down by snipers. Eventually, they
[01:09:41] this, I mean, this goes on for a long time. They're in the supporting position. They're laying
[01:09:44] down five or shooting thousands and thousands and thousands of rounds. Back to the book,
[01:09:50] the CSM shouted, stop, stop. War now, we rested our heads on the ground.
[01:09:56] The battle had now been going on for some 11 hours. How long we had laid their firing? I did not
[01:10:06] know the CSM came over well done. A company are moving through to our left now. We've covered
[01:10:16] them and given them all the help we could give. The rest is up to them. We can't fire anymore.
[01:10:21] It get to them. It's too close now. It'll be light in an hour or so. Pull the gun back and dismount it.
[01:10:30] Surred did we get any ass bob? More than enough he replied and walked away.
[01:10:37] Had we killed? We must have. I felt nothing afterwards. Just relaxed. I hadn't seen our targets.
[01:10:47] They had been hidden in darkness. We hadn't killed at the end of a bayonet or through a rifle site.
[01:10:53] We had killed with a spray of machine gun bullets. It didn't seem personal.
[01:11:00] It was as if the enemy hadn't existed at all.
[01:11:03] They complete that mission.
[01:11:24] They crawl back to a little bit of a covered position away from where they had been
[01:11:29] supporting. And then here we go back to the book about 70 meters away. The ground exploded in a
[01:11:37] massive earth, shrapnel and rock. Then another shell came over this time further to our right.
[01:11:43] I looked down the hill as the shell exploded and saw an unbelievable display of flying red sparks
[01:11:49] dead be shrapnel. The ground shook as shell after shell fell behind us. The first minutes of
[01:11:56] shelling were terrifying. So they've been, this is it. Now they started. We mentioned that they
[01:12:04] were in artillery range and we all know what an absolute horror show artillery is.
[01:12:13] Back to the book and the distance a booming sound began. That carried over the area. Someone's
[01:12:18] screen incoming. Sure enough the air disappeared. There was a wash and the explosion killed any
[01:12:24] remaining piece. The shells came in thick and fast. I lay watching the red glowing shrapnel flying by.
[01:12:32] Now the shrapnel was creeping up towards me. The explosions getting so loud I thought they would
[01:12:37] defen me. The shells were landing about 50 meters away. Four or five shells would hit an area in a
[01:12:43] salvo. Then the next batch would hit about 10 meters nearer. The booming from Stanley could still be
[01:12:50] heard in the gaps between explosions in our areas. As I lay there watching the shrapnel getting
[01:12:56] closer I found myself shaking. Was it from cold or fright? My legs shook and I couldn't control
[01:13:03] them at all. The next salvo landed 30 meters away. I curled up into a ball as the shrapnel
[01:13:10] splintered the rocks around me. A piece of shrapnel landed in my little alcove still burning with
[01:13:17] fury sizzling into the dirt by my waist. Four or five more shells landed around us and then it stopped
[01:13:26] as if it had never begun. The air was misty as though a fog had swept over us. I lay back praying
[01:13:33] it was over. In the half light of the false dawn I could now hear shouting all down the hill.
[01:13:40] Some guys were screaming like mad. One voice went right through me. The scream of a man who knows
[01:13:45] he's about to die. All over the hill people were shouting medic medic. I was about to crawl
[01:13:55] from my hole when another shell hit the ground. I hadn't even heard it coming. I fell on my face and
[01:14:02] stayed there for a few seconds. Another shell landed nearby. This time a shower of dirt fell on my back.
[01:14:08] I crawled back into my hole and crawled up again, waiting. My body shook uncontrollably.
[01:14:17] The shells landed in thick salvo's, the noise and explosions around me, making my head spin as if
[01:14:23] someone were banging in against a wall. I wielded the to stop, but the shells carried on. I'm landing
[01:14:31] around me. Then this second bar bombardment within minutes ended as suddenly as it had begun.
[01:14:42] So horrible, horrible situation that they're in. And much like we talked about the Germans having
[01:14:54] their mortars dialed in and they're artillery dialed in. It's the same thing. You're in the
[01:14:58] Falkland Islands. There's obvious terrain features. So when you're holding a city like the
[01:15:03] the Argentinians military is in the city of Stanley, well they know where they're going to get
[01:15:09] attacked from and they know what are good firing positions. So they have those positions dialed
[01:15:12] into their artillery and they can just start hammering them. Back to the book, I can remember the O.C.
[01:15:20] shouting behind me. Move, move. There artillery will be here soon again. So now they're trying to move.
[01:15:24] Sergeant P waited only for me to squeeze myself through the gap before he took off again.
[01:15:30] After we had gone about four or five steps, a hand dropped out of the rocks grabbing at my ankle
[01:15:36] and denoms. The shock of it made us jump instantly. Sergeant P was back with me.
[01:15:44] We both looked at my feet. Still holding my denoms was a wounded argy.
[01:15:48] His eyes were staring at me pleading perhaps full of sorrow. Sergeant P shouted step back
[01:15:56] Brammer's. I tried to step back but the wounded soldier tightened his grip on me. I leaned
[01:16:02] back as Sergeant P pointed his weapon and fired two bullets into the man's head. The noise of his
[01:16:07] weapon echoing around the small gap. Tomo and Johnny were behind me now. The argy's head bounced
[01:16:14] quickly as the two rounds entered him. His eyes rolled to the back of his head and his mouth opened
[01:16:19] to the release of trickle of blood and saliva which ran down his chin onto his shirt collar.
[01:16:26] At the same time his hand gave up its grasp on my denoms and dropped onto my boot.
[01:16:32] I flicked my boot as if I was playing football. His hand and arm dropped across his body and from
[01:16:39] his mouth came a low whistle of air mixed with blood. All this took seconds but it seemed like a
[01:16:45] lifetime to me. Each date detail remains with me today. The sight of this guy dying at my feet
[01:16:52] shocked me but I was growing harder. Although shaken I felt no remorse at the time.
[01:16:59] The deadly game of war lay at my feet. Only I mattered.
[01:17:04] The rights of wrongs, the rights and wrongs of war can never be argued from the armed chair.
[01:17:13] Decisions are made on the spot questions asked afterwards.
[01:17:18] That lone argy could have been rigged to a booby trap or even armed.
[01:17:24] The kill was done quickly and professionally. I felt that I should have acted as quickly as
[01:17:30] Sergeant P. Come on move he shouted. Sergeant P screamed in order for me to follow him.
[01:17:38] As we trotted further into the clearing we had to jump over the twisted pile of corpses.
[01:17:45] My mind was never nor has since been so alert. A adrenaline was rushing through my body so
[01:17:52] quickly that I felt I was floating with excitement mingled with fear. A little further into the
[01:17:58] clearing lay three or four Argentinians visibly shaken. Shaking visibly close together on the ground.
[01:18:06] We ran half walked through a deadly sickening area of death. They looked up as we arrived.
[01:18:13] All had been seriously wounded and were moaning and crying.
[01:18:18] One held up his hands across his eyes and shouted mama.
[01:18:21] I felt he thought that we were or I was about to shoot him. He was known calling for his mama
[01:18:31] in a low whale. One Argentinian sat in a trance. His eyes wide and staring at nothing.
[01:18:40] Tears ran down his face the only sign that he was alive. None of them moved.
[01:18:46] All looked like they expected to be shot by us but we ran past. The whole area was littered with weapons,
[01:18:56] helmets, clothing and food and ammo. A few bullets whizzed overhead and smashed into the rocks.
[01:19:05] A corpus shouted that tumble down. This is another prominent terrain feature.
[01:19:10] Tumble down was firing at us. We ran into a tight gap in the gpath and all came to an abrupt
[01:19:17] halt as it was a dead end. Four or five bodies lay sprawled their close together.
[01:19:25] This time they were our own men. The camouflage pair of smocks hit my eyes immediately.
[01:19:34] CSM Wix was standing over them like a guardian, screaming at some of his men to cover the further
[01:19:39] end of the path in the small crest. The CSM and Sergeant P exchanged quick words. I wasn't listening.
[01:19:47] My mind was totally occupied with looking into the crags for the enemy. I turned to look at
[01:19:53] our own lads dead on the ground, mode down when they tried to rush through this gap.
[01:20:00] I felt both anger and sadness. The CSM's face showed the strain of having seen most of his company
[01:20:08] either wounded or shot dead. That night's fighting was written in every line of his face.
[01:20:17] We all doubled back into the clearing we had just run through. We spread out and waited for our next move.
[01:20:24] A wounded Argentinian lay right next to me 10 meters away. He'd been hitting the chest and
[01:20:31] screamed as he held the wound. A lad from B company ran across the clearing atom and ran his
[01:20:38] bayonet through him. The screaming Argentinian tried to grab the bayonet from him before it took his life.
[01:20:49] Our lad screamed shut up, shut up you cunt. The enemy soldier died as the bayonet was withdrawn.
[01:20:57] The lad walked back to his seat among the rocks as if nothing had happened.
[01:21:07] To my right, three Argentinians were crying with their heads in their hands.
[01:21:13] Were they the dead men's friends? At their feet lay one of our lads,
[01:21:18] moaning in pain as a medic attended to him. I could see his back was peppered with trappinol.
[01:21:24] I swung to my left and fell against some rocks. I now felt the shock of it all coursing through my body.
[01:21:34] I wailed softly, my throat feeling like I wanted to choke.
[01:21:40] My eyes watered and I shook my head to force myself into reality.
[01:21:47] But this was reality.
[01:21:48] I looked for Bob and Johnny. I couldn't see Bob, but Johnny was there staring right at me.
[01:22:00] Our eyes met telling each other that we felt the ended come.
[01:22:07] A lad resting with his rifle pointed towards tumble down,
[01:22:11] turned, fell into a tight ball, curling himself up as he hit the ground, screaming, incoming, incoming.
[01:22:20] We all dropped to the ground, crawling behind rocks wherever we could.
[01:22:24] The first shell went over us onto the west side of the mountain.
[01:22:28] Then the shell started to creep up towards us, and one bump into the clearing, hitting a rock
[01:22:35] about 30 meters away. The ground shook as if we'd been hit by an earthquake,
[01:22:40] shrapnel prite pierced the ground or bounced off of rocks all around us.
[01:22:46] Grant, grinned him, screamed out, the shrapnel had hit his leg.
[01:22:50] Two of his mates were pulling him into better cover as the shells rained down us around us again.
[01:22:58] Soon after, corpus Stuart McLaughlin was hit in the back
[01:23:04] by shrapnel. He was later killed by a direct mortar hit as he was being taken to a first aid post.
[01:23:13] I laid their trembling as shells roared over us, each explosion shook more fear into us.
[01:23:26] We had centered our group about halfway along the mountain.
[01:23:32] The O.C. shouted us to split up a bit, otherwise a direct hit would cause a heavy loss.
[01:23:38] Through your four anti-tank lads got up and ran to a bunker on the other side of the hill,
[01:23:43] as another salvo came rushing in on us. A shell crashed into the rock above the O.C.
[01:23:49] sending shrapnel and rock in the opposite direction to us.
[01:23:54] He looked up at all of us, as we looked at him expecting him to be dead.
[01:23:58] Since the shell had only landed a few meters from us all, he shouted across.
[01:24:03] Well, that was an oddie. One wasn't it.
[01:24:06] We laughed unanimous in appreciation of his complete calm.
[01:24:14] The shells came in for over an hour.
[01:24:17] We just laid their hoping, praying that it would end soon.
[01:24:21] I lay looking straight into Johnny's face who at times would poke out his tongue or do his grin again.
[01:24:32] The shell and stopped as usual as suddenly as it had began.
[01:24:38] I stood up and saw Cav Connery crouched by a rock.
[01:24:42] Cav I screamed. He looked over and smiled.
[01:24:45] Get your arms over here, you twop!
[01:24:46] He had started to walk towards us when two or three more shells hit home.
[01:24:53] We all flopped the ground once more. The vibration of the explosions shook us on and the earth landed
[01:24:59] on our backs. We jumped up to see Cav running towards us. He jumped into our little opening.
[01:25:06] Jesus, fuck me, he said, I've had a right night of it too.
[01:25:11] Where's Johnny Crow and Skitty? Mate, I asked.
[01:25:14] Cav looked into my face and said, Johnny's dead.
[01:25:20] He's dead, Vince killed outright. Skitty's been wounded. Only me left.
[01:25:26] Oh, for fuck's sake, how?
[01:25:30] In the attack, a burst around's head, Johnny Square in the chest. I reckon he was dead before
[01:25:34] he hit the ground. Cav explained. We carried on chatting about the situation in general.
[01:25:40] Rick Westy was brewing up for us when we heard the booming sound again from Stanley.
[01:25:47] Incoming someone screamed, not again Johnny shouted.
[01:25:52] We were getting more scared with each bombardment. We hit the ground and fought to get legs,
[01:25:56] arms, and bodies more comfy and secure than each others.
[01:26:01] At this rate they'll get us. We can't have luck on our side forever, you know, I shouted,
[01:26:06] as the shells exploded around us. I lay next to Cav, we both faced the mess tin, where a couple
[01:26:12] was brewing. A shell landed not three meters away, sending shrapnel and dirt in our direction.
[01:26:19] Rocks and earth fell around us, then over us, as if we were about to be buried alive.
[01:26:26] Both Kevin and I automatically reached out to cover the mess tin and the water that was coming to a
[01:26:31] boil. The dirt landed on our hands and the brew was saved. Everyone burst out laughing.
[01:26:41] Talk about a time of crisis to all let's have a cup of tea Johnny shouted.
[01:26:53] Brutal. The, you know, great account and I know we've been done gone through a lot of
[01:27:00] accounts of being sheldered with artillery. That's a very descriptive and granular one.
[01:27:09] And it's not over. Back to the book, Kevin, I walked up and over the hill.
[01:27:17] Ricky followed us armed with a smock order with every pocket filled with mags for SLRs. We came to
[01:27:24] a clearing. Ricky was busy looking to one side of us when suddenly Kevin I heard moaning. We stepped
[01:27:30] up on a ledge and came face to face with a wounded argy. Sitting beside him was his friend who
[01:27:37] obviously wouldn't leave him. The wounded soldier had been shot in both knees and in his chest and arms.
[01:27:45] Blood showed on all the wounds his face showed no pain merely pleading. His mates stood up and put his hands
[01:27:53] up. No one had seen these two until now. I pointed my rifle and bay in that and nodded towards
[01:28:01] the wounded guy. He started wailing and moaning and put both hands together as if praying to me.
[01:28:09] Kevin pulled a pistol from his belt. Well, Vince, we either shoot them or help them.
[01:28:16] What will it be? Kevin lowered his pistol and looked at me. I raised my rifle and framed the wounded
[01:28:22] argy's head right in the sight. The man looked down as if he was expecting death knowing that he could
[01:28:29] do nothing about it. He wailed louder. I lowered my rifle.
[01:28:40] Kevin, he looks like my neighbor. I'll help them, okay? Yeah, okay. I'm off the find some goodies.
[01:28:46] He walked off. I motioned to his mate to sit on the other side of the wounded guy while I
[01:28:53] placed my weapon to one side of me and went down to help. The wounded argy's mate shook his head,
[01:28:59] looking at my rifle. Me, friend, me, friend, you, friend. You helped my friend. We all friends now.
[01:29:07] He pleaded. I looked at him and gave him a small grin. He grinned back. I didn't trust him one bit.
[01:29:17] The wounded guy started to cry. It was then that I felt sad. Sad that I had fought of killing
[01:29:24] them and that we were all in this mess together. We had different views and different homes,
[01:29:31] but there we were all together. I still hated the enemy, but just then when that guy started to cry,
[01:29:39] I felt different. We all had to be hard, hard to the facts of what was happening to all of us.
[01:29:48] Killer be killed.
[01:29:49] I made my way back to where our team was stationed. I got there as Rick was sitting down.
[01:30:00] The O.C. was busy with orders. Vince, we're out of water. Got me. Johnny asked. No,
[01:30:06] I replied. Just then Captain Mason shouted. And Avv you've seen Peter Headaker around.
[01:30:12] I saw him last night with Gith with Jin, with Jin and West Sir. I shouted. Perhaps West
[01:30:20] you'll know. Captain Mason looked at me with serious eyes. All the support team who were sitting there
[01:30:29] looked at Captain Mason and me. I felt something was wrong. The O.C. motioned me over.
[01:30:36] I got to him and crouch down. Corporal B. Jin's McCarthy was killed and so was Philip West.
[01:30:47] The shell was meant for your gun team. A flashback of what had happened filled my mind.
[01:30:54] The smock pulled from my back, the spinning head, the deafness.
[01:30:58] It must have missed you by inches. Corporal B. U.K. Yeah. I'm okay. I'll go find Headaker then.
[01:31:10] Captain Mason came over. Sir, he said to the O.C.
[01:31:15] Pete Headaker was killed also. The bearers have now found his body.
[01:31:20] I stood up and walked back to my spot. I was gutted beyond belief. Pete had always been my mate.
[01:31:35] We spent many times together drinking in the shop. I met his family too.
[01:31:41] Now he was dead. Only a short while ago I'd been sitting beside him.
[01:31:52] He'd said what a good spot he had. Now he was dead. Killed by a shell that was meant for me.
[01:31:59] I'll never forget that I survived while he was killed.
[01:32:07] So they do some movement. They actually get back up into their positions to where they were.
[01:32:31] Actually, the word, where gingit been when he had been killed. Going back to the book, we turned around to where
[01:32:37] gingit lane and walked back from the skyline to find a gap through which to find the gap through which
[01:32:44] sergeant P. had led us. In this way, we avoided being seen from tumble down.
[01:32:50] On the ground, I saw bits of clothing and flesh everywhere resembled a slaughter yard.
[01:33:03] We walked down 10 meters or so and there was more and more.
[01:33:08] Stuck on the side of Iraq was clearly a large piece.
[01:33:12] Johnny and I moved closer to it and my stomach turned as I saw the nose and cheek of a face.
[01:33:22] We looked at each other, our eyes wide. I put my bandet under the flesh and flicked it to the ground before
[01:33:30] bearing it quickly. Neither of us spoke. I had no doubts and P. N. confirmed to me that this was the
[01:33:43] remains of a mate. P. told me later that he had died instantly, from only the waste down remained.
[01:33:51] I felt good at beyond belief. I had been told of the direct hit that it also killed two others
[01:34:04] to see it with my own eyes. The body and remains was another story.
[01:34:08] Over walking over the crest, we bumped into Pat Harley. With him were one or two others,
[01:34:21] although I no longer remember who they were. As I was talking to Pat, I noticed a helmet on the
[01:34:27] end of an SLR planted in the rock face. Notting towards this, Pat mentioned that he had come up
[01:34:35] and found Jordi Lang dead. We rounded the rock face and at our feet laid dock and Jordi,
[01:34:44] both on their backs. They had died in an open space with the infamous tumble down looking down on them.
[01:34:54] Jordi had died trying to save dock. The bastard sniper had caught him in the open as he reached him.
[01:35:01] Jordi lay with his mouth slightly open. Gunshot wounds to his chest and stomach meant he died quickly.
[01:35:13] Evidence around him showed that he had tried to reach dock. He had been
[01:35:18] had he been calling for him, help himself. Pat looking cut up took Jordi's
[01:35:25] bags, saying he'd want us to have these rather than the re-election on. Returned our attention to
[01:35:33] dock who was more depressing. docked head and died quickly. Quickly. He must in fact
[01:35:41] have been fully aware of his injuries. The top part of his skull was blown away the brain visible
[01:35:49] smashed by a sniper's bullet. Only the fragmented skull had prevented the complete collapse
[01:35:56] of the side of his head. How he survived the impact God knows, laying beside him were items from
[01:36:03] the first aid kit he'd been carrying. Field dressing half open, safety pins in his right hand fingers
[01:36:09] near the ground. His left hand held a morphine syringe. This had been used the thin needle point
[01:36:18] towards him. It must have been his dying act. His radio mic was still attached to his throat.
[01:36:27] Her close friend told me many months later, dock fell on his radio, the sending switch was stuck
[01:36:34] and he was on permanent send to all of us. We could hear him gurgling and moaning as he became
[01:36:42] aware that he had been shot badly. Vince and sent the signalers nuts, but we were all helpless.
[01:36:52] The sniper picked it anyone that moved. Jordey tried and lost his life for it.
[01:36:59] We eventually had to turn on to the emergency frequency to establish communications again.
[01:37:04] Doc had remained conscious and eventually died on a part of that mountain, alone with a lad
[01:37:13] who would bravely try to rescue him.
[01:37:15] So, just to explain that on your... Yeah, what's called a push to talk button on your radio
[01:37:35] and however he fell, he landed on that push to talk so that he was broadcasting his death
[01:37:47] and his dying was broadcast over the network for everyone to hear.
[01:37:52] These guys, they still have to fight and they start gathering against some intelligence.
[01:38:10] They think there's a counter attack coming in. By the way, this intense fighting is a matter of gaze.
[01:38:16] So, everything that we're talking about is happening in a couple days.
[01:38:19] And now they think that there is a counter attack coming.
[01:38:23] So, they dig in, they get in position, they set their machine guns up from where they think the counter
[01:38:30] attack from the Argentinians is going to come from. And then they start getting mortar again.
[01:38:38] Hit with artillery, here we go back to the book. We all hit the ground again as the shell landed.
[01:38:42] No sooner had I started to pick myself up. When a high-pitched scream rushed into my ears,
[01:38:47] a deadly sound, I can still hear it today. I looked down to where the shell had hit in the same
[01:38:54] areas before. The ground was smoldering, smoke lifting and evaporating.
[01:39:00] Five meters away from the hole, lay two bodies. The sight of one of them will stay with me until I die.
[01:39:08] His parasmoc was riddled with smoke escaping from every corner. The arms, bottom and collar.
[01:39:17] The lad turned on to his back screaming, oh God, help me, help me, please.
[01:39:24] I ran down the hill in fright and concerned. I dropped to my knees by the screaming soldier. His eyes met mine.
[01:39:31] Did he register me? I only saw Denzel. Denzel, the character we all loved.
[01:39:41] I wrenched my eyes to his legs. One was hanging off ripped to shreds. The bone clearly visible.
[01:39:49] His screaming churned by stomach. It was like nothing I'd ever heard. He tried to look down at his
[01:39:54] leg. Don't fucking look this way. I barked, lay back down, hear me. He dropped to his back holding his
[01:40:00] spot. Five. Jonah Jones, a nine squadron lad came to my side. Vince, I'll deal with him. You see
[01:40:08] the him. He said pointing to Craig Jones. Craig lay very close to Denzel.
[01:40:15] Clive rushed to help me. Craig hadn't any visible wounds. He lay quietly as
[01:40:20] Clive tried to talk to him. I tried to pull a smock open and pull his trousers down to check
[01:40:27] for a wound. Denzel screamed and moan behind me. Help me. Jonah was busy seeing to his leg.
[01:40:35] I pulled out my knife and started to cut through Craig's denoms and quilted art at clothing.
[01:40:40] My friend at cutting was too slow and I knew it. The doctor skitted him beside me.
[01:40:44] Pulled out his scissors and started to cut through Craig's leggings.
[01:40:50] I pulled the ripped material to one side. We had reached the skin.
[01:40:53] His legs had massive laceration and all directions spilling muscle and bone,
[01:41:00] but there wasn't hardly any blood. The doctor shouted at me to tie his muscles together.
[01:41:06] I pulled out my field dressings and tied the laceration together. The doctor was joined by a
[01:41:11] medic who went to Denzel. I was half conscious of cries of medic. Metic stretcher bearer all
[01:41:18] down the hill. Craig was lying still. I slid up beside him and looked into his face.
[01:41:25] It was pale with no color at all. His eyes stared into my face.
[01:41:32] You'll be okay Craig. Just hang on mate. Hang on.
[01:41:36] Clive held his head. Stroking his forehead repeating my words,
[01:41:40] Craig, can you hear me? I shouted. The doctor pulled in tubed frantically at Craig's clothing
[01:41:45] trying to reach more obvious wounds. Craig, you'll be okay. Hang on.
[01:41:53] You looked at me and his slight smile came across his face. His eyes laughed at me.
[01:42:02] Bright and wild. His grin spread. Then all expression faded.
[01:42:11] And he faded away. Craig, Craig, don't keep in there. His eyes closed. He died then and there.
[01:42:34] He was a young soldier 20 years of age. The records will say,
[01:42:44] private Craig Jones. The doctor motioned a bearer to get him on and away.
[01:42:55] Dencil was also lifted and carried away. I fell onto my bottom.
[01:43:06] Jones and Clive padded me on the shoulder. I tried to get up but felt to my knees again.
[01:43:13] I hadn't realized until then that I was crying crying without knowing it.
[01:43:17] I cried with all the pain and sadness. It didn't seem fair.
[01:43:30] Johnny came to my side and picked me up. He picked up my weapon and started to guide me to our bunker again.
[01:43:37] I glanced at Steve and Sass. Sass was crying as well and Steve had his
[01:43:41] head buried in his hands. I stumbled to our bunker weeping. When I sat down Steve
[01:43:55] wake put around his arm around me and whispered, you'd done a brave thing Vince.
[01:44:00] I couldn't have gone down there after those shells landed in the same spot.
[01:44:04] You done all right mate. His gesture didn't register. I cried with exhaustion, hatred, and pity.
[01:44:19] Craig and Dencil remain with me today. Craig who died and Dencil lost a leg and so nearly as life.
[01:44:25] When people write or tell of experiences of this kind, I know now that they can never
[01:44:35] really tell the facts for anyone to totally understand. For often the reader is wrapped in his own
[01:44:42] make-believe game of war. For me personally this five-minute experience changed my whole life
[01:44:50] and attitude towards war. War's will always be fought and I would go again for my beliefs,
[01:44:59] but I hope never again to see a face fade from me. It took me nearly a year.
[01:45:08] After this war for Craig's face to go before I slept. Newly a year to wipe out Dencil's
[01:45:17] smock on fire and his scream. Until I die it will remain a part of me.
[01:45:26] And because it is war there is no time to mourn and soon after that they are marching for their final
[01:45:53] assault on Stanley, which is the capital city. Going back to the book after we had tabbed about
[01:46:00] 1000 meters with wireless ridge clearly visible above us. The absence of troops and the silence of
[01:46:09] guns in Stanley began to produce some puzzle looks along the line of support company.
[01:46:15] Our O.C. shouted for a halt. We collapsed on the frosty ground to wait for orders. I looked
[01:46:21] up at the sky thinking what now? Who's fucked up this time? Let's just get this part started.
[01:46:29] A few shouts came down the line. I lent forward and saw that the line was breaking up in the
[01:46:33] men laughing. Sergeant McMathus was sitting behind me. Besides me. What's going on? Make I asked
[01:46:41] fucknose events. The shouting continued as messages passed down towards us. A guy three or four
[01:46:50] positions down from us suddenly turned round and shouted the wankers have surrendered. A white flag
[01:46:56] is flying over Stanley. Put your braze on index index. The last part of the message had an ironic
[01:47:05] ring because for some of the task force the whole thing had seemed like an exercise. So index is a
[01:47:12] term. We say it all the time and training. When you want to stop the exercise you say index
[01:47:17] it's short for index or size. So that's one of those things where it seemed like for some of the
[01:47:22] guys they were just on this big exercise. And so they literally said hey it's index and to the exercise
[01:47:28] right now. Make and I looked each other. Bollocks I said we stood up to see the remains of free
[01:47:35] pair of coming off longden in their red braze. Joy washed through my body. Make and I hugged each
[01:47:43] other. Nothing more was said. The message had reached everyone. I slipped off my helmet and put
[01:47:51] on my beret which had stayed close to hand throughout. As I stood looking down at moody brook
[01:47:59] the red braze stuck out like sore thumbs against the grass. I felt proud. The beret on my head
[01:48:08] meant more than any task the army had ever thrown at me. It meant victory. The feeling is
[01:48:18] indescribable. Now that's that and they spend obviously it's over but it's not like you just
[01:48:33] get to step and it's instantly over. They spend time there. They go through some pretty significant
[01:48:40] looting and he talks about that a bunch and he kind of comes to he goes kind of berserk and looting
[01:48:48] and they're all just gathering up war trophies and whatever they can find to value and they go into
[01:48:53] this one sort of a bunker position to loot and they on one side of the bunker it's all a bunch of
[01:49:01] weapons and the other side is other kind of more personal type items and they have so many weapons
[01:49:07] if they don't need anymore so they go and they start taking stuff from the other side.
[01:49:12] Mem a little like I said personal items I think it was and they walk out of there and then the next
[01:49:19] day they find out that the side with the weapons on it was all booby trapped with 70 pounds of explosive
[01:49:26] so they went in there if they would have picked up like two or three things off of that it was
[01:49:29] a pressure plate a pressure release so if they were picked up two or three things they would have
[01:49:34] gotten killed his him and his crew would have gotten killed and that's when he realized you know when
[01:49:38] he talks about he's like I was so greedy I wasn't even thinking anymore they go through that they eventually
[01:49:45] they get done they ship away and eventually end up two and I wonder then from from a different
[01:49:52] island they fly back to back to England and here we're going back to the book we stepped off the plane
[01:49:59] at RAF Brise Norton the next morning we were hit by the English summer in full blaze as we entered
[01:50:07] the airport lounge the doors were slung open to screaming crowd of relatives who charged towards us
[01:50:14] my mother climbed over chairs to hug me with all the rest of my family and close pursuit
[01:50:18] my wife came up to me I was tense and made unsure by all the noise and shouting it made me
[01:50:26] scared in a peculiar way Karen looked hard and almost angry hello Vince was all I got from her
[01:50:36] so he's home obviously his wife was a little bit tense about some things back to the book
[01:50:43] he actually before he go back to the book he they they do a little quick greeting with their
[01:50:48] family but then they get back on a bus with the rest of the the people the Italian members
[01:50:55] and they start driving back to their compound back to the book always very quiet on the journey
[01:51:00] the English countryside made me feel like an alien Johnny tapped my shoulder from behind
[01:51:06] Vince the trees man look at them I looked at the trees they were part of what was making me feel
[01:51:12] like an alien they were all in full bloom bright green leaves in the wind there was traffic on the
[01:51:19] roads shops people walking about doing their own thing it all seemed unreal after only three months
[01:51:26] away it was a shock to see civilization again the odd thing was I felt anger anger and everyone
[01:51:36] for doing their own thing it was as if something in my head was urging me to shout at them as they
[01:51:41] walked along the streets hey you looking your fucking ice creams there's a fucking lot of injured
[01:51:47] guys over there friends have been killed but all you're interested in is yourselves
[01:51:58] just frustration I know the general public was concerned but it just didn't seem like it then
[01:52:07] I wasn't expecting a metal or even a pad on the back I really didn't know what to expect
[01:52:11] even so I found it hard to become there was no way I could relax if I had been asked to go
[01:52:19] do a torn Ireland I would have gone more than anything I felt the pinch of no longer having my
[01:52:25] friends around me we had been together so tightly over the last few months that it was as if
[01:52:32] now I had had a set an arm severed the buddy buddy system that we had needed to literally survive
[01:52:40] wasn't there anymore and the sheltered life now seemed too far
[01:52:46] but now seemed to me far too boring to endure I made a point of not talking about my experiences
[01:52:54] to any member of my family including my wife but I do remember sitting up in bed one evening
[01:52:59] turning my wife and giving her a very mild insight into what had really happened I was sick
[01:53:07] to death of the presses views and of the publicity of a country still high on war
[01:53:14] I told Karen what had happened to Denzel and Jones the blank look she gave me
[01:53:22] with a half smile told me she wasn't interested and couldn't understand me at all
[01:53:29] I never said anything again I tried to look at it from her point of view instead she was sick of
[01:53:37] the war of the army and of me going away whenever I bumped into one of the lads I see more at home
[01:53:45] and relax talking our private language with him then I did with civis and my own family
[01:53:54] if I had had my own way I would have gone out on the biggest bend or ever
[01:53:58] but I knew that was the easy way out
[01:54:10] these remind me of one soldier's war you know you come back and there's no doubt
[01:54:18] when you come back from war you're gonna feel some of this I'm gonna tell you right now
[01:54:22] you're gonna feel some of this when you see civilians walking around
[01:54:25] looking their ice cream cones it's gonna it's gonna it's good it's a it's a rough transition
[01:54:32] you know back to the book there's no doubt that I was slowly unwinding over the long leave
[01:54:40] but the board I'm also gave me more time to think about my experiences
[01:54:45] worst of all were my nightmares about the war
[01:54:48] at first they came nightly later they faded and returned intermittently
[01:54:56] I always had the same dream of Denzel's smock and Jones's face passing before me
[01:55:04] I would wake up in a bed so wet that a bucket of water might have been thrown over me
[01:55:11] the nightmares lasted about six months or so today I can see and understand everything that has
[01:55:16] happened to me I know now that I wasn't alone the most comforting words I ever had to help me
[01:55:24] did not come from any of my family my family were concerned but could never really understand
[01:55:30] what I was going through those words came from my friends in the pub as we drank during leave
[01:55:38] Johnny turned to me and said vents I've had a few turns in the night you know
[01:55:44] that made me sit up and see clearly that I wasn't alone and when you're not alone
[01:55:53] you're stronger
[01:56:00] so that's something that I hear from a lot of vets
[01:56:05] and maybe you're thinking that this is something you're experiencing that no one else is
[01:56:14] not true not only are other guys going through it other guys have always gone through it
[01:56:23] you're not alone back to the book I fully believe that we as a nation performed the most
[01:56:27] excellent of tasks I'm fully behind the decision to send the task force and I wouldn't
[01:56:33] hesitate to fight again for a country and its beliefs people who win jibbout the decisions taken
[01:56:41] in war they weren't involved in to me are the most misguided of all the most striking events
[01:56:52] to affect me throughout the war were obviously the deaths of my friends
[01:56:56] eight years ago I regarded those friends as those in two and three pairs only
[01:57:04] now after learning about others experiences and after watching and reading others accounts
[01:57:09] I see that the whole task force was my friend I watched a marine sergeant in a TV documentary
[01:57:17] his eyes showing the emotion of his story and the site told me we were all the same
[01:57:31] I still feel a bit angry that the wounded went unnoticed a propaganda film on the task force
[01:57:38] as a rival home showed only the pairs in the Marines in the navy homecoming
[01:57:42] can you remember seeing the badly wounded coming through the gates I think not
[01:57:52] nobody wants to see the effects of carnage never again will I think that war is just a game
[01:58:04] like they showed on TV it is very different from how it is portrayed in books and films
[01:58:09] we call ourselves into the killing game don't we I remember very clearly watching from a window
[01:58:18] of my quarters five or six kids playing a war game some were even dressed in combat gear
[01:58:24] and carrying small toy machine guns I watched with interest in their tactics and attacking
[01:58:31] a cardboard box that was meant to be an enemy held position the two kids defending rolled over
[01:58:38] and pretended to die went over run by the goodies after being tegged by their friends they got
[01:58:46] up to resume the game from me high we start to practice what is in human nature to defend and kill
[01:58:59] the one big difference between their game and the real one is that you don't get up after really
[01:59:06] being shot who are as the legal killing of people and can be very scary
[01:59:15] who are as killed or be killed we also must remember that a lot of the command structure
[01:59:25] at junior rank level can almost be too difficult to maintain in the heat of battle
[01:59:29] then what becomes a winning factor is the determination of the private soldier
[01:59:39] his loan get up and go and do attitude we must take our hats off to the junior ranks of all
[01:59:49] services for they are the backbone of the war machine in that they have to kill a close range
[01:59:54] we are lucky to have what is perhaps one of the best fighting forces in the world
[02:00:02] thanks to our system of training and to our discipline
[02:00:09] even today I feel frustration about the war I was so psyched up to carry on with the fight
[02:00:15] into Stanley that the Argentinian surrender may be disappointed as well as happy
[02:00:20] I try very hard to keep out of fist fights now as I wouldn't like to lose myself control
[02:00:31] do my alone in feeling this or their hundreds or thousands of other time bombs out there
[02:00:43] other experience veterans may be sympathetic to all of said
[02:00:46] we can only wait for the next war now to practice the art of killing again
[02:00:55] I hope I'm there to help
[02:00:59] finally I must quote a first world war veteran who told me so many years before I joined the army
[02:01:07] you'll like the army events but not war it's horrible boy he was right
[02:01:20] I didn't like it then again I did
[02:01:27] I'm going to close this book out with the beginning of this book and it reads
[02:01:48] this book is dedicated to the soldiers of three parah whose comradeship and determination
[02:02:00] throughout the campaign make the author proud to have served with them
[02:02:08] so that the members of three parah who never returned are not forgotten their names and ages
[02:02:14] at death in action are listed below
[02:02:20] private Richard Absalon military metal 19 years old
[02:02:29] private Gerald Bull 18 private Jason Burke 17
[02:02:36] private John Crow 21 private mark Doddsworth 24
[02:02:48] private Anthony Greenwood 22

[02:04:19] Corpore Alex Shaw 25
[02:04:29] private Philip West 19
[02:04:35] and
[02:04:53] you notice those names
[02:04:58] those men their ages
[02:05:01] and their ranks they're all their all junior ranks
[02:05:08] the one sergeant sergeant Ian McCay
[02:05:14] who was awarded the Victoria Cross for storming 50 caliber machine gun
[02:05:20] mission but the rest of those men are privates and Lance Corpore's and Corpore's
[02:05:32] young men and
[02:05:39] as Kipling pointed out
[02:05:41] they're no plaster saints by any stretch
[02:05:51] but damn
[02:05:52] they might not be saints
[02:06:12] but I've no men like these
[02:06:14] and I've seen them with my eyes
[02:06:27] and as I have said
[02:06:32] and as this tale of the Falquins confirms once again
[02:06:37] war is hell and it's a hell that can bring out the worst in men
[02:06:49] but it can also bring out the best
[02:06:58] and don't forget these young men
[02:07:00] who like so many others
[02:07:10] answered the call
[02:07:14] fought and died in that awful place to protect their brothers
[02:07:22] and for the more and if you read this book you will realize that we all have a little bit more to give
[02:07:40] mentally and physically you can go further you can push harder
[02:07:46] you can be more ruthless if you have to be and you can also show more mercy
[02:07:59] you can be better
[02:08:03] I can be better we can all be better and we most often get better not from the easy things and not from the good times
[02:08:12] but from the hard times then the challenges and the suffering in life that pushes you to your breaking point
[02:08:26] and demands that you give absolutely everything you have
[02:08:31] but you have to keep going
[02:08:44] so no matter what
[02:08:53] keep going
[02:08:53] and I think that's all that I've got for tonight
[02:09:07] to be
[02:09:19] crazy hell how it got that crazy that vicious in like that short period of time
[02:09:28] it is and we we had to remember that that's what we have one perspective
[02:09:34] from one squad for in one platoon and there was you know the story of two pair
[02:09:42] the one where the battalion commander
[02:09:45] eight Jones won the victorier cross by the way what about that what about that story
[02:09:54] and not to mention the royal marines that were down there as well what about their stories
[02:09:57] yeah and that's the thing that just it's I still can't wrap my head around the amount of
[02:10:07] untold stories that there are and not just the not just the fact of the stories
[02:10:13] but to think that these because this is this battle is a very short time compared to Vietnam or
[02:10:22] World War Two or World War One or even the wars that we've been fighting today that have been going on
[02:10:27] for years and years and years but it's not so much at the story that that like we're missing the story
[02:10:34] but these people existed everywhere and they exist everywhere and and yeah it's it's
[02:10:47] it's an incredible the take a look at the book by the book and read it and it's I actually
[02:10:57] I got into some of the graphics stuff some of the some of the interaction to them when they're not
[02:11:01] in combat is actually it's real crude and I didn't you know I didn't cover much of it not that
[02:11:08] you know I wanted to get to more of the combat constraints that's kind of I didn't realize that I
[02:11:12] didn't cover as much as sort of just the straight-up crude behavior that they that they I mean they're on the
[02:11:18] both for a while they're drinking they're getting drunk when they're coming home it's there's some
[02:11:22] some crude behavior and and things that are taking place and that's kind of why I jumped on the
[02:11:30] opportunity to read Tommy by gippling because that's totally true then you know what they say in
[02:11:38] kind of our way of saying that in the seal teams we would say this we that guy is a in case
[02:11:47] of war break glass kind of guy oh yeah meaning we don't want him around all the time we want to keep
[02:11:52] him over here on the side in the glass but yeah if something happens yeah break glass and we'll get
[02:11:57] this this frog man out now what's what's jacked up about that is that's that played more
[02:12:05] of a role when I was first in the seal teams and the more the the older I got the moment sure I got
[02:12:11] the more I realized like that's that's okay but it doesn't really work what you need is to have someone
[02:12:18] that you can have out of the glass and that learns and what you have to do is a leader is you take
[02:12:24] those guys that instead of putting those guys in the glass jar or behind a in a glass box somewhere
[02:12:30] and keeping their in case war what you do is you do what you do with a freaking wild dog you have to
[02:12:36] train them you have to bring them out you have to socialize them amongst the humans so that they
[02:12:40] can so that they can interact because a guy that you have to keep in you know in behind a glass
[02:12:46] barrier from the rest of the world the chances of you needing him for that type of situation are
[02:12:53] pretty minimal so what about all the other situations that he'd be beneficial for so what you have
[02:12:58] to do is a leader is teach those guys that have the attitude of you know I'm just I'm just a
[02:13:04] nothing but a straight warrior don't care about anything else I'm here to go to war otherwise leave
[02:13:10] me alone what you want to do is you want to get those guys out into the world socialize them like a good
[02:13:15] attack dog that that's not going to bite anything in front of it's going to actually bite what you
[02:13:19] want it to bite and then you have something that's a much more valuable not only for you as a
[02:13:25] leader but for them because they have a much better opportunity so there's still a few guys left in the
[02:13:30] old mold of in case of war break glass but most of the guys now are are actually
[02:13:36] more versatile than that and I'll tell you when I was young I was probably falling at a category
[02:13:42] I wasn't exactly the guy you wanted to throw out in front of the admiral to look at right and say
[02:13:51] this is our model guy right here it's you know wouldn't have been that way now at the old
[02:13:57] I got them or I recognized how important having that both sides of the of the coin covered
[02:14:03] and you couldn't just be of freaking rampaging berserk or all the time you had to actually
[02:14:08] be a professional yeah to be a professional and so I definitely had my share of time spent in that zone
[02:14:16] back in the day but what's good is I think guys knew that about me and that therefore when I
[02:14:25] came up to and said hey man look we gotta we gotta do better than that or hey we we can't be acting like
[02:14:31] that they knew that I wasn't coming to them from a from a what's that we're from the ivory tower
[02:14:38] I wasn't looking down on them like all I can't believe you're not that way we don't act out
[02:14:44] way we're naval representatives I wasn't coming to like that I was coming to and hey we're professionals
[02:14:50] we gotta get we want to get hired to do jobs we want to kill bad guys we got to get missions
[02:14:55] we got to get mission approval those were the things that that you know I kind of passed on to
[02:15:01] to my guys was hey that's cool be a frog man but be a disciplined frog man yeah be a frog man
[02:15:08] that can represent and I think that's another thing in the book when there's no war going on how
[02:15:14] we're that you know they're they're the kind of maniacs you know yeah and and then when the war breaks
[02:15:19] out they go even more maniacs style and it's almost like they get into that mode of like who cares
[02:15:27] anyways we're gonna die we're gonna die we just you know who cares but after you go to war
[02:15:32] for an extended period of time you're like actually you're not gonna die actually
[02:15:36] there's a decent chance you're gonna live and there's a decent chance that you need to
[02:15:43] continue to build you know the the reputation of the seal teams not just as
[02:15:50] where killers but where professionals yeah so and we should have a reputation of both
[02:15:55] and we do by the way thanks ill professional killers is right but yeah it's a great book there's
[02:16:04] a lot to learn from it there's a lot to learn again I that that the way that they're going
[02:16:09] from peacetime and again I know that they were doing tours in Ireland at the time and that was
[02:16:13] no joke and they took casualties in Ireland and there was many soldiers killed in northern Ireland
[02:16:20] but that wasn't comparable to what they went through in the focklands so it was interesting to see
[02:16:26] how they handled approaching combat for the first time yeah another part that I think these books
[02:16:33] really bring to light is just the physical conditions that that they go into even talking
[02:16:39] talking to you guys when you guys talk about how hot it is then everyone's gonna all you
[02:16:42] add a detail like oh yeah so I'm like you know all my clothes are all wet from my sweat
[02:16:47] and usually that's not part of the movie when you watch the movie you know or like these guys
[02:16:51] is for just feet are falling off you know because it's cold and I was sitting in a combat outpost
[02:16:57] in Ramadi and it was nighttime right the coolest part of the day and I wasn't doing anything and
[02:17:03] I hadn't been doing anything and I was literally sitting in a combat outpost you know the
[02:17:08] boys were out in an Overwatch position and I was back there I had been quarantined but I did it it
[02:17:12] wasn't that it wasn't that established of a combat outpost yet so I still had all my gear on
[02:17:17] but I was just sitting there I've been sitting there for let's call it two three four hours
[02:17:22] and I was sitting there and I just kind of put my I was sitting down and I angled my back to like a
[02:17:28] 45 degree angle and I was kind of looking at the ground kind of resting a little bit and as I looked down I was
[02:17:33] full athletic sweat dripping off me like that fast and I wasn't doing anything yeah that's just
[02:17:41] that's the bait that's where you start yeah that's where you start not to mention guys legs
[02:17:45] getting blown off all this stuff all these yeah man yeah that's crazy yeah it's um the physical
[02:17:53] and the other big thing is the physical conditioning that you need to be prepared for
[02:17:59] is is pumping with a rock sack on yeah that's a big deal that you know that you know they don't
[02:18:04] show a lot of that no and any kind of military training they don't just show it they don't show
[02:18:09] it enough they should they should I mean we just did another trip up to Yosemite and we got our boots boots
[02:18:15] boots on and it's it's if you're not conditioned for that it's gonna be hard and you can make it
[02:18:23] through a day yeah maybe you can make it through two days but also you're not carrying I was telling
[02:18:28] my my kids up there up in the mountains you're not carrying any weight compared to what you carry
[02:18:36] with when you have gear when you have the when you go tactical you don't have the you probably
[02:18:41] have 30 pounds maybe if you're just if you're just camping or whatever you've got a couple you
[02:18:47] got a couple leaders of water you've got a sleeping bag in a ground pad you've got some trail mix
[02:18:53] maybe a little bit more food but you're talking 30 40 pounds tops yeah you get geared up
[02:19:01] bro I would weigh guys would before we'd send them out on training operations I'd weigh
[02:19:05] them training operations they're there rocks away like 110 pounds you're gear alone you're your
[02:19:12] body armor helmet ammo magazines you know magazines an ammo grenades you're your 60 70 pounds
[02:19:23] then you put water that you're talking I think I think I weighed like 310 or something with like
[02:19:29] you're on seriously like roll well cop yeah roll the cop still heavy on on roll I think it was part
[02:19:37] two where he shocks himself because he wants to get rid of the messed up director see like given
[02:19:42] he falls down right he's unconscious and then they're like hey we gotta help him they try to pick
[02:19:47] him up oh he's too heavy to move yeah that actually happened to uh we were on a training exercise
[02:19:54] and tea bruiser and I got put down they said a jockel your dead so I made down and I just
[02:20:00] laid there and life came over to throw me in the back of the home v i was like a robot cop down there
[02:20:07] so life got a couple buddies who said hey guys help him move jockel still not moving dead weight
[02:20:11] job and they're like okay yep you know you were like making extra effort to be dead weight
[02:20:16] oh yeah for sure like you're like I'm not fully participating you know training exercise
[02:20:20] I wanted those guys to be prepared to put a grenade in my mouth and be there so you get some
[02:20:30] awesome well speaking of lots of stories maybe you could tell some stories about
[02:20:38] how to support this I'd be happy to know no short story hey did you get into drinking
[02:20:46] pomegranate white tea and subsequently jockel white tea because your wife is a Brit no he's into tea
[02:20:52] she turned you on the tea and she didn't really because they drink tea with milk and I don't
[02:20:58] yeah but you know hey you can get a credit but she doesn't get credit for that one she drinks tea yeah
[02:21:04] she did drink her put the kettle she says she says a couple tea couple tea like here or anything she says
[02:21:09] well couple tea what's the reason real but doesn't cure everything is the same thing like that I don't know
[02:21:15] who that was yeah I think it's like Chris Ross I don't remember specifically where I got the first
[02:21:20] cup of jockel white tea from but I do remember that it was in the desert when I was I was at the training
[02:21:25] command and I was would be giving the debriefs or sitting through the guys briefs and we'd be
[02:21:32] going on like 234 hours to sleep so you need a little bit of kick yeah somebody has somewhere I
[02:21:39] got some jockel some tea yeah it wasn't yet jockel white tea just pomegranate white tea yeah and
[02:21:46] yeah that's where I'm for and I drank it I was like this nice yeah this is nice the cold one
[02:21:52] yeah wait was it cold yeah yeah yeah or definitely had it cold because you're at the desert
[02:21:55] you don't want to drink hot tea unless you're British yeah yeah kind of productive they be drinking
[02:21:59] hot tea no matter what they don't even drink lasty I don't really like hot tea that much
[02:22:04] yeah that whole island they don't really like iced tea like you can't go to restaurant all
[02:22:09] so iced tea they look at you like you're weird yeah yeah which I've been looked at many times there
[02:22:13] yeah for me weird this face it you you're kind of weird bro that's all right anyway
[02:22:20] you got if we want to support ourselves first off I'm gonna talk about my little stories not sure
[02:22:26] sorry Longland no please kidding remember I told you I got to take a little bit of press I got the
[02:22:31] on it kettlebells right so if the first ones I got get all the the design of ones they're cooler
[02:22:36] might be yeah I don't think I've ever yeah I used the regular ones before at other gyms
[02:22:43] but anyway I get the the cool ones the ones that someone takes a picture of me and I have
[02:22:47] on my look like extra cool with the primal you can see how different our thought patterns are yeah
[02:22:52] you're here to win I get it and I can dig it fully but I got the chimplons those are
[02:22:58] what one pood okay whatever the 16-ing killer went up to the werewolf just the other day I ordered
[02:23:08] the gorilla what's that one 70 something I got a pair I incorporate that in I'm getting strong
[02:23:16] man I'm getting good at the kettlebells you're gonna need them 88's like I got yeah wait what is the one
[02:23:20] that that it's big foot right I don't know what that is but my the biggest kettlebells that I currently
[02:23:26] have yeah our 40 kilograms yeah it's like yeah 88 pounds what's 90 something because 2.2 pounds per
[02:23:35] kilogram okay so it's like we can do the math if you want but nonetheless that's heavy oh I don't
[02:23:42] know I'm I don't know if I'm ready for that and given my current exercise program with them
[02:23:48] I do we should start doing math exercise yeah maybe more break it's calculated or whichever
[02:23:54] either way that's the one I got and so so look yeah I'm gonna recommend it if you're into kettlebells you
[02:24:00] want to you know get your kettlebells on get on it once they're cooler that's my opinion good
[02:24:06] a lot of cool stuff I got a jump rope and stuff like that too um you know what I'll say did
[02:24:14] hundred burpees in 10 minutes oh brand like where you at yeah yeah yeah see remember last time
[02:24:19] you did it yeah I didn't brand it just so you know echo is now he notoriously bad cardio
[02:24:26] not like that I mean you you you you credit I'm giving you credit but still we could use that
[02:24:32] as sort of a statement to say if echo could do it come on brand and yeah actually I think the
[02:24:37] statement is look off our echo has come look how far I think that's the statement will make
[02:24:43] I just made it there you go far echo has come said he can do a hundred burr a lot of people thinking
[02:24:47] how on a burpees in 10 minutes is a joke actually yeah I could I could dig it I mean I've been doing
[02:24:52] burpees for for a while not that kind you know not to kind my they're just in my routine
[02:24:57] oh yeah many but I'm familiar with them so I'm like okay you can you know how you can kind of
[02:25:00] gauge like okay I do this many so what it would a hundred take out of me you know can I do it
[02:25:05] 243 2010 yeah so how I did it was 25 one minute rest 25 one minute rest 25 one minute rest
[02:25:14] 15 and then like two minute minute and a half maybe I don't know something like that give
[02:25:21] or take and then a 10 and actually sorry 11 I did 101 burpees and it was nine minutes flat
[02:25:30] that's good yeah branded what you got here's what I found here's I don't know if my cardio is good
[02:25:36] or bad is better than it has been it's better than all time just in general even due to
[02:25:41] and other stuff what's the stuff all so you know I'm you know when you run and I don't know
[02:25:46] you know get not just yeah whatever hey life man something life those physical challenges at you
[02:25:53] either way so yeah I did 101 in nine minutes flat what it was was I wasn't breathing as hard as
[02:26:01] maybe you might think like that wasn't the the issue wasn't the breathing was like just
[02:26:06] boom push up but I'm pushing it jump and the acting acid okay yeah yeah yeah but would you feel legs
[02:26:13] weird yeah legs fully shoulders not chest like I think you know do it a push up one every you
[02:26:20] know second isn't that much for me but strangely my shoulders and this part that like what you call
[02:26:26] these the serrats they're like sore next day you know weird way it was weird man none the last
[02:26:31] yeah I did prove that burgers are good exercise yes fully got you some funky work out there yeah
[02:26:37] this is it's good and then so I go in youtube I see this one guy does 100 in a row oh my
[02:26:42] dang because 25 was I didn't know I was gonna be like hey I'm gonna do as many as I can how long
[02:26:48] it's taking me 100 in a row oh three minutes and 33 seconds if I'm not mistaken that's credit yeah
[02:26:54] you know what here's the thing though here's the thing I think it's the thing I don't know
[02:26:59] it's thing or not that's why I'm asking a question okay so what really is a burpee I mean as far
[02:27:03] as like okay so when I first started doing burpees I want to do burpee is you your chest touched
[02:27:08] the ground and jump in there okay so what about my hands do they have to go about my head or can
[02:27:12] they be yes technically it's a little clap over the head oh a clap so what I mean over the head like
[02:27:17] technically has to be above the head so if I go like this or doesn't have to be well this you guys
[02:27:21] do this I do a little bit of everything and depending on how tired I am okay if you see when I'm
[02:27:25] really tired my clap was barely happening and it's happened and like six inches in front of my belly
[02:27:30] yeah okay so here like but if you want to be like technical yeah I mean a really technical
[02:27:37] perfect burpee would be like both hands clapping up above your head as your six inches in the air
[02:27:42] yeah you can't do too many though you can't do as many those though no bear to tell you
[02:27:46] not at all that's kind of the difference between the dynamic jump like a high jump
[02:27:51] and not a dynamic jump is real big huge huge and that's the word is the line so
[02:27:58] for me here's the line get your hands above your head get your feet off the ground that's it right
[02:28:03] I think that's yeah I did I I was otherwise you're like hey you didn't jump
[02:28:08] three inches yeah but what if you know because if you want to do that what you do you put your
[02:28:12] your you put your 135 on the ground a barbell with 135 on it and you hop over that
[02:28:18] and each time chest to the ground on one side chest the ground on the other side chest to the
[02:28:22] that's another way if you're going to require I like when you can't cheat but you can't cheat that
[02:28:28] right you have to jump over it yeah no that's what's cool about like burpee pull ups you
[02:28:33] you gotta get chest to the ground I don't care how you do it chest to the ground and get your
[02:28:38] chin over the bar that I don't care what you do in between those two yeah that's a burpee
[02:28:41] making it pretty much alright well then I have to be honest then here's my disclaimer
[02:28:47] the push up it I didn't touch my chest to the ground you need like okay I mean was it like
[02:28:53] was it like an incomplete probably some of them were like I mean I guess I don't do I'm not like
[02:29:01] every single time right yeah here's the thing it's to your discretion right it's like it's like
[02:29:07] that's you know when you didn't do a burpee let's face it if we wanted to you know get some
[02:29:13] Guinness Book of World's right scenario then sure yeah but we we I think you're right
[02:29:17] you know what a burpee is yeah I know what a burpee is yeah get it right yeah so mine and just to
[02:29:23] kind of in the spirit of honesty so I didn't touch my because here's the thing if I was to
[02:29:30] if in on the push up part if you touch your chest over every time you actually slow down enough
[02:29:34] that it's not hitting your cardio as much yeah in my opinion yeah maybe I mean I guess added up
[02:29:40] yeah I guess and you know what I saw though when I saw that guy doing the burpees he was on
[02:29:45] I think it was just a regular gym floor maybe a mat or something and he was doing it and after
[02:29:50] while he starts banging his chest like oh he's showing my goal you're getting a bounce on the
[02:29:54] bench I'm saying yeah getting a little bounce so I'm thinking you know what that could be easier
[02:29:59] for me if I did on a mat I think it'd be easier than having to stop your body weight and not
[02:30:04] touch you know but it's gonna be what you're used to for sure but I didn't touch my chest and
[02:30:10] there were like four of them that I didn't put like four because when I started the set I'm like oh shoot
[02:30:16] those you know two or three I didn't put my hands above my head so I didn't show it yeah you know
[02:30:21] so maybe like four five of them didn't technically count but I feel like if I would have put my hands
[02:30:26] above my head on those four it wouldn't have made a difference that's what I think but if I'm like
[02:30:32] you know the kind where I'm filming at the master you know I'm filming this girl she's doing the
[02:30:36] perfect burpy while I'm filming her chest to the ground in fact when she went chest to ground
[02:30:41] her hands came up off the ground oh just for like a second I'm like dang this feels like
[02:30:44] you know what do they call the girls I think they call this game day pushups I don't know
[02:30:47] okay and I don't know maybe I'm wrong yeah yeah I just called that which is weird exactly
[02:30:51] you have a game day every day's game day so that's what you call it do that every day but
[02:30:57] either way she's doing that and then she's going into the and her hands are straight in the air like
[02:31:02] she's straight up with the everybody's in the shandie I go cross for uh sandy ankle master
[02:31:07] not an autexus I put the clip in the video okay slow mox check it out yeah and she had the perfect
[02:31:13] form full beast mode full on and I'm thinking when I see that compared to the 101 that I did
[02:31:19] no night in day man there would be like yeah he's not doing this whole part here in that
[02:31:23] my hands are going like this they're going like this so they're above my head
[02:31:26] I don't know what I'm gonna like it maybe Brandon Peckworth is doing eight inch or 12 inch
[02:31:30] vertical leap on each one like a beast and we're calling him out and he's actually
[02:31:34] I know he's doing it the cracker and sorry Brandon if that's the case all right good well the
[02:31:39] goal is now 100 I'm gonna follow the protocol I know one in 200 yeah like in a row yeah yeah
[02:31:46] that'd be the big good yeah I'm gonna follow the protocol for sure oh I'll report back anyway
[02:31:51] back to the kettlebells that's a good one the jump rope stuff that's a good one
[02:31:54] on the on it one sets the cool ones my opinion just go on there check it out go on it
[02:31:58] dot com slash jocco boom it's for yourself and the podcast also good way to support
[02:32:06] when you buy these books the jocquer reviews did I chime in to everyone tomorrow good or
[02:32:13] the website joccopadcast.com and chime in much today yeah man I was always kind of a heavy one yeah
[02:32:19] heavy and I'm not gonna so you know what part I was gonna chime in what I respect your decision
[02:32:26] but I respect your decision not to try to get it well you know how you're like it was at the
[02:32:31] end anyway wait you're like this is just one story yeah you know you take and it's a slidly a sliver
[02:32:37] really it is it's a sliver it's one guy and one story it's one guy there is four or five thousand
[02:32:43] British servicemen down there yeah it's one five one four thousand so this this was my comparison
[02:32:49] you know when you're driving in traffic on the street whatever the freeway and all you see is cars
[02:32:55] oh my god infinite cars traffic is everywhere just cars and cars and cars and that's nothing
[02:33:00] new and facts kind of irritating really but if you just take one little step like in your mind and
[02:33:06] and look in the car and look that's a person in there and maybe sometimes two people in there
[02:33:12] sometimes a little family each one of those people has their whole life story all the little
[02:33:19] ups and downs and special things and you know challenges challenge struggles and triumphs all that
[02:33:24] stuff you're one of those little things is a little guy in there and and even then that's no
[02:33:29] buddy compared to everybody so that's analogy I was gonna make but seems kind of trivial you know
[02:33:36] compared to like guys on the freeway I like our story that's out of police yeah I got a self-cuff
[02:33:42] police anyway back to these books if yeah if you want to get any of these books one or more
[02:33:48] whatever they're listed by episode on the website jocopotcast.com and and by the way we started off
[02:33:54] today before he record record record I said to echo you know you heard the book the what's
[02:34:03] that saying don't judge a book by its cover the cover of this book you can judge it by it's called
[02:34:09] excursion to hell by Lance Corporal Vincent Bramley and the picture on the cover looks like hell
[02:34:17] it looks like it's a picture of him it's blown up real big but yeah you can judge a book by
[02:34:21] its cover you can tell it's gonna be a rough story yeah it looks like he took a straight up excursion
[02:34:26] to hell on that cover but if you want this book go to jocopotcast.com set a little tab on the top
[02:34:32] thing you know top menu whatever books from podcast jocopotcast books whatever it's called
[02:34:36] boom they're listed there by episode click through there get it through there good way to support
[02:34:41] yourself of course and and the podcast takes you to Amazon also or if you're other shop any other
[02:34:48] shopping oh that's a bonus bonus if you buy some port massive good that's still supports it's
[02:34:55] more big time yeah like what like a like a 100 terabyte hard drive how much is that cost like four to five
[02:35:02] grand oh not 45 grand four to five so like 40 depends which one you get or like a lawnmower can you
[02:35:08] buy a lawnmower from Amazon you can now yeah what do they do they they come with a big
[02:35:14] forklift truck and be like oh not that big dude well no no no oh I'm sorry I'm thinking driving on more
[02:35:21] oh so what do they do back it up is your lawnmower I don't know you probably can maybe
[02:35:26] okay treadmill I know you can get a treadmill yeah treadmill is pretty big well either way
[02:35:31] you can do your shopping boom click through there takes a two seconds small action really big reaction
[02:35:38] by way of support I actually have been thinking that that is actually not the best analogy that
[02:35:45] you've been using for like you would think that but you'd be wrong I think a better you ever
[02:35:50] heard of the the expression death by a thousand cuts yes it's more like that even though life by a thousand
[02:35:55] clicks clicks sure yeah support yes yeah man I dig it because they all add up together yeah
[02:36:03] because the sodium is little but it's big but you have to join it with all the other ones yeah so now
[02:36:08] you have a bunch of little sodium's boom huge reaction huge support wide spread huge support
[02:36:14] by this little action from these you know what it is actually the sodium's better because of
[02:36:18] if I'm clicking through I'm a listen I'm listening to this podcast I'm like you know I'm
[02:36:22] gonna support I'm by one of these books I'm gonna you know by lawnmowers treadmill whatever
[02:36:26] I click through the website just that two seconds of going to the website first clicking through
[02:36:33] that's like so much potential in my click just like the the sodium so much potential energy in
[02:36:38] there especially when you mix it with the water you mix it with the Amazon the click boom
[02:36:42] support you follow we can move on yeah there you go back to my point anyway I just to everyone

[02:37:49] consider like if you never go I would always work with a group this last week and they're full on
[02:37:54] caught up on the podcast every single episode legit dudes getting after it and I mentioned the
[02:38:01] deleted scene that came out and they there are three of them none of them had seen it oh see
[02:38:06] none of them had seen it and that's that's a good scene it's funny anyways yeah I know I use bad

[02:40:29] stuff it's so to this stuff maybe we're actually some Canadian yarn art yeah maybe but yeah
[02:40:34] go on there check it out if you like something get something good way to support also psychological
[02:40:39] warfare what psychological warfare is if you don't know it is in album with tracks joc would tracks
[02:40:46] and what he does is on the tracks he's talking to you each track and he's to each track he's talking
[02:40:53] to you about different stuff weaknesses different weaknesses there you go so really this is what you
[02:40:58] need this is a different stuff doesn't cut it yeah because joc was talking about you about the type
[02:41:03] of toothpaste that he uses right right now I didn't say that well maybe it depends you know how
[02:41:09] there's a controversy about for right being in the toothpaste you know I'm just saying that's important
[02:41:15] I'm really egging you on today I'm just saying you brought it up bro anyway what it's really for
[02:41:20] this album is in your campaign against weakness yeah that's the new phrase not journey anymore
[02:41:31] it's campaign against yeah yeah Andy good bread he gave me though because I don't like saying journey
[02:41:40] that's what I'm saying message you and said hey quit saying journey say campaign against weakness
[02:41:45] which is actually from the podcast which is legit layers big time anyway thanks Andy for that one
[02:41:51] but that's the one I'm using for right now until like a better one comes up if that's even possible
[02:41:55] so in your campaign against weakness every single day for the rest of your life now that's you're
[02:42:00] in the game right now it's for the rest of your life yeah I can't pay last forever yeah there's no discharge
[02:42:05] for the war yeah I'm a tank so there's how many out big time anyway so if you're trying to wake up
[02:42:12] you know early every day or you know five days a week however long you know however much
[02:42:17] and you got that day where you supposed to wake up early and you don't want to you just don't
[02:42:20] feel like it that's really the thing you don't feel like it you know so joc is there for for you
[02:42:28] with the little spot diet stuff procrastination stuff workout stuff creativity stuff that's a
[02:42:34] big one and I don't listen to the creativity one that's because you feel like you're all creative
[02:42:39] no but here's the thing I'm like one of those things you know how like you know how like let's say
[02:42:43] you had like a pimple or something or is it I know I'm going deep but if you have a zit some people
[02:42:50] they're like I'm gonna pop this in some people they're like no leave it alone let it go away
[02:42:54] you see what I'm saying so I'm like the I'm the latter when it comes to creativity I'm like man
[02:42:59] I'm not creative I'm not creative block don't don't force it don't like get joc on here telling me
[02:43:06] pragmatically by the way but still you have to it now you have no good idea thankfully it's a little
[02:43:12] bit more than that but you know that's kind of the philosophy I'm not saying that's the best way
[02:43:18] in fact I made you a fact you're in the spirit auto you're missing another good
[02:43:22] tenacious d reference that I just made but that's kind of a good thing about this is that that's
[02:43:26] not what it is you know how like you'll explain like you know part of it and this is a total
[02:43:31] pair of phrasing situation but you said it in a really good way before when you're like memorize the

[02:48:55] big deal for some reason they ask me like what do you think in there I answer it that's why
[02:49:00] wrote that book yeah well like any situation where it's like your face with a decision to do this thing
[02:49:05] and it's hard but you know it has to be done or should be done or whatever and
[02:49:10] so many times where you just when you shift or someone tells you something hey look at it this
[02:49:14] way and you know like my dad would always say do it and it'll be done and it's like thing
[02:49:18] all it took was really thinking a certain way be safe to your Nancy yeah be see be see says do it
[02:49:24] and it's done yeah it's true you get that book from Amazon from Barnes and Noble whatever
[02:49:30] little bookstore is around you go and tell them to get it or you consider around and watch
[02:49:36] life pass you by it's up to you also extreme ownership it's still going strong why is extreme
[02:49:42] ownership still going strong is it because the massive advertising campaign that we put
[02:49:46] under the the uh New York Times and the Wall Street Journal no actually we didn't do that you
[02:49:50] know why it's going strong because of word a mouth that's what it's going strong for because
[02:49:55] one person gets it they buy it for this person that person buys it for someone else that person
[02:49:58] buys it for their team that's why we're still selling that thing like crazy why and why was it
[02:50:02] going through word a mouth because it works functionally works it's not theoretical it is pragmatic
[02:50:08] it's functional it'll make you a better leader and it'll make your team better period we've seen
[02:50:15] this over and over and over again that's why it's selling a lot so get yourself and your team
[02:50:20] so you can implement that and you can win then for your business if your business needs some
