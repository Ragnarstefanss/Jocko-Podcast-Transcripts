00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.96 This is Jockel Podcast number 96 with echo Charles and me Jockel Willink
00:00:06.56 --> 00:00:08.56 Good evening echo good evening
00:00:09.84 --> 00:00:13.36 And we are going to roll right into some Q&A
00:00:13.92 --> 00:00:19.54 From people of the interwebs, yes, well, they're not actually of the interwebs. They're from
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:26.12 Right everyday life, but through the inner you know is where we receive questions. Yeah, cool
00:00:26.12 --> 00:00:31.42 Yes, it's been a while right since Q&A has been a while since Q&A. That's cool
00:00:33.40 --> 00:00:35.40 All right, well
00:00:35.40 --> 00:00:37.40 First question
00:00:38.48 --> 00:00:45.08 Recently at my job we got a new supervisor one who happens to be retired army after 20 years
00:00:45.24 --> 00:00:54.12 He and I had a pretty heavy run-in to which resulted in getting HR involved the end result was that I would not be written up for what he claimed I was doing
00:00:54.12 --> 00:00:59.32 He tried to make an example out of me almost as soon as he got here assuming I was easy
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 He assumed I was an easy target
00:01:03.20 --> 00:01:06.60 Anyways to the point even though he and I had a falling out
00:01:06.60 --> 00:01:12.48 I'd still like to see the guy succeed at his job and become a great leader after listening to your podcast over the last month
00:01:12.48 --> 00:01:17.52 I'm making an effort to improve our relationship at this job instead of just avoiding the man
00:01:17.52 --> 00:01:21.52 I've recently purchased your book extreme ownership
00:01:21.52 --> 00:01:27.28 How do you suggest I present this book to my new supervisor and read or to read without
00:01:27.28 --> 00:01:31.44 I'm feeling as if I'm belittling him as to say he needs work on his leadership
00:01:31.44 --> 00:01:33.92 I think you could benefit from it greatly
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:40.28 Good question. Yeah, it's actually a question. I've answered on here before
00:01:40.28 --> 00:01:44.88 Model answer to again because I even learned when I repeat sure
00:01:46.24 --> 00:01:48.24 This is my latest
00:01:48.24 --> 00:01:53.84 Version of what I tell people when they need a situation. Yeah, updated version because you get better at things
00:01:53.84 --> 00:01:56.64 You figure out better ways to overcome challenges
00:01:57.12 --> 00:02:00.64 Especially when you're presented with the same challenge over and over again, which I kind of am
00:02:01.52 --> 00:02:07.92 Some challenges like this one. So here's what here's what you do you give it to him and you say
00:02:08.44 --> 00:02:10.44 you know, hey boss or hey
00:02:10.80 --> 00:02:13.44 person hey I got this book and
00:02:14.60 --> 00:02:18.000 I'm trying to really emulate the principles
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.28 That are in this book. It really hit me and I would I was wondering if I could ask you a favor
00:02:23.28 --> 00:02:27.44 If you could just look through this book kind of see what the principles are and then
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.24 If you see me falling out of line with the principles that are in this book
00:02:32.72 --> 00:02:33.92 Let me know
00:02:33.92 --> 00:02:40.80 So I can fix them basic things like if I'm not taking ownership of problems if I'm if I'm not keeping things simple
00:02:40.80 --> 00:02:44.04 If I'm not supporting other people around me covering and moving for them
00:02:44.04 --> 00:02:49.000 Just let me know that's all I'm asking because I'm really trying to do a better job. Could you do that for me?
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.60 So then the person says well, yeah, okay fine, you know, and then they read the book
00:02:53.88 --> 00:02:58.44 And when they read the book sure there's a chance that they're everything and like oh this book is about everyone else
00:02:58.44 --> 00:03:00.68 And it's not about me right, right? That's possible
00:03:01.88 --> 00:03:05.48 There is also a chance a higher chance that they read the book and go. I
00:03:06.48 --> 00:03:10.96 Make a lot of excuses. I play well. There people all the time. I'm probably not doing a great job as a leader
00:03:10.96 --> 00:03:16.16 And that might be subconscious. I see that sometimes know where people are subconsciously making adjustments
00:03:16.64 --> 00:03:21.32 Because they don't want to admit that they're the person that that that the problem they don't want to admit that they're the problems
00:03:21.32 --> 00:03:27.72 So they make these little adjustments kind of subconsciously and other people will tell me that the boss is like changing
00:03:27.72 --> 00:03:31.44 Oh, yeah, they're they're changing their game. They won't admit it
00:03:32.12 --> 00:03:38.80 But they are changing their game. So that's what you hope for is that they do they go through that transferation from
00:03:38.80 --> 00:03:44.60 You know, not taking ownership and treating people bad and not trying to build relationships and all that stuff
00:03:44.60 --> 00:03:52.20 That makes them into a bad leader into taking ownership building relationships covered moving keeping things simple all the stuff that makes you a good leader
00:03:52.20 --> 00:03:54.52 That's what the hope is now
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.44 There's also a chance that this person's gonna hold the grudge
00:04:00.28 --> 00:04:06.04 Right, we we got to deal with that and I'll tell you I was recently talking to someone that had
00:04:06.04 --> 00:04:11.20 Step on the toes of another visit another division inside their business
00:04:12.20 --> 00:04:15.20 Another sales division and you know sales people are
00:04:15.88 --> 00:04:17.88 Sort of known for being
00:04:18.40 --> 00:04:23.56 Protective and aggressive. They're protective of their territory. Well, this guy kind of stepped into their territory a little bit
00:04:23.56 --> 00:04:26.68 Oh, call some bad bad vibes giant rifties
00:04:26.68 --> 00:04:30.12 You know what I do? You know I I feel like all this animosity now and
00:04:30.88 --> 00:04:34.84 It's one of those times I just said to myself well, what would I actually do if I was in that situation?
00:04:34.84 --> 00:04:36.84 How would I try and get this problem solved?
00:04:37.20 --> 00:04:43.48 Well, what I would do is walk up the person who I stepped into their territory and cause problems and I'd say hey
00:04:44.48 --> 00:04:49.48 Hey, I wanted to tell you I I totally was out of line when I stepped into your territory
00:04:49.48 --> 00:04:53.04 That was completely my fault and you know I was just
00:04:53.48 --> 00:05:01.20 Got target fixation which is bad. I didn't talk to you which is bad. I stepped into your world which is bad and
00:05:01.20 --> 00:05:09.40 And I left the disaster and I'm sorry that's that all that stuff everything that I just said all my fault and
00:05:09.88 --> 00:05:12.60 I want to let you know that I completely recognize it and
00:05:13.32 --> 00:05:19.20 Number one anything I can do to try and redeem that and make it up and make you realize that and anything
00:05:19.20 --> 00:05:23.76 I can do to support and help you move forward. I don't I will not let that happen again
00:05:23.76 --> 00:05:25.76 I just want to let you know that
00:05:25.76 --> 00:05:28.56 so boom just step up be humble a
00:05:28.56 --> 00:05:30.56 Apologize and
00:05:31.44 --> 00:05:35.36 Say hey can you what kind of do you to help you what kind of your support you?
00:05:36.04 --> 00:05:37.68 That's
00:05:37.68 --> 00:05:43.20 Where I would go with these with this question and then a sort of an addition to that question. Yeah
00:05:44.08 --> 00:05:47.52 It's kind of like you know when you when you give your boss the book, right?
00:05:47.52 --> 00:05:54.68 And be like hey, this is what I'm doing is that kind of like when you when you get you know like if someone has a bad bad breath and then you put him gum
00:05:54.68 --> 00:06:01.000 You know you eat some gum and he said hey you want some gum? Yeah, that's very similar
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.20 You just break out the gum. You know I was like to do this. You know just to make sure I was like to have a piece of gum just to make sure
00:06:06.20 --> 00:06:10.60 You know, you want one. Yeah, yeah, you can have you might want to take two
00:06:13.28 --> 00:06:15.28 Oh, yeah, you think you really can wait
00:06:15.68 --> 00:06:20.52 Yeah, what if I had bad breath in let me let me handle this before anyone can smell it
00:06:20.52 --> 00:06:25.08 Yeah, oh, you know that just for my because I laughed sure just remind me of two things
00:06:25.08 --> 00:06:28.40 I just saw on the on the interwebs one was a person that said
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.52 Something negative about about the podcast or the book and he said look this guy should just smile
00:06:35.68 --> 00:06:40.76 He doesn't you never smile anything and someone of course was like you might want to listen to his podcast because he laughs
00:06:40.76 --> 00:06:42.76 lot and then someone else
00:06:43.08 --> 00:06:47.62 Said this guy should just pick up a guitar. He doesn't eat his head. No anything about freedom
00:06:47.62 --> 00:06:50.44 And someone else got us a he does play guitar
00:06:51.28 --> 00:06:54.42 Cool haters not not new little fact checking
00:06:54.42 --> 00:06:56.42 Yeah, that's all I'm saying
00:06:56.42 --> 00:07:01.20 Uh-huh if you want to fill us a maiden round just do a little little fact checking because we're over here laughing
00:07:01.54 --> 00:07:04.18 We're playing the get box from time to time
00:07:05.42 --> 00:07:07.78 So you call it the get box get box
00:07:07.78 --> 00:07:10.66 I've heard that before yeah, you gotta be old school
00:07:10.66 --> 00:07:12.66 That one I
00:07:14.90 --> 00:07:16.90 Next question
00:07:16.90 --> 00:07:20.02 Jacob do you still respect people without discipline?
00:07:23.18 --> 00:07:24.18 Interesting okay, so
00:07:24.82 --> 00:07:28.66 First of all my baseline as a person is to respect people
00:07:28.82 --> 00:07:32.12 That's my baseline now that is not the same as
00:07:32.42 --> 00:07:37.66 Something we've talked out about before which is that doesn't mean I expect a lot from them. Okay?
00:07:37.66 --> 00:07:42.58 You see the big difference there. I respect people. I respect you are respect what you're doing that doesn't mean I expect
00:07:43.30 --> 00:07:50.14 That you're gonna be humble or you're gonna be hardworking or you're gonna be brave or you're gonna even be a slightly deep decent human being
00:07:50.14 --> 00:07:52.14 I don't expect any that but
00:07:54.86 --> 00:07:57.34 But I and let me let me phrase this carefully
00:07:57.74 --> 00:08:02.30 That doesn't mean I don't treat them with respect now you notice that I just changed this
00:08:02.30 --> 00:08:09.42 Yes, it's not just about I actually respect you. It's I'm gonna treat you with respect. There's a big difference right?
00:08:09.42 --> 00:08:16.30 I'm gonna I'm gonna treat everyone with respect but as far as actually respecting someone
00:08:17.82 --> 00:08:24.10 No, no, I'm not just automatically respecting people now I'll treat them with respect because I don't know who they are
00:08:24.10 --> 00:08:27.50 I don't know what struggled they've had in their life
00:08:27.50 --> 00:08:34.10 I don't know what they've been through. I don't know that so I'm gonna treat them with respect and it's very similar like a Gigiitsu perspective
00:08:34.46 --> 00:08:36.46 You don't know
00:08:36.46 --> 00:08:42.86 Okay, Gigiitsu perspective no-gui, right? You don't know good someone is no, no, yeah, you don't you don't
00:08:43.58 --> 00:08:49.90 And and this is another thing when you when you know how good someone is and let's say you're better than them
00:08:50.38 --> 00:08:55.82 If you really understand Gigiitsu you realize that you're better than them because you've been training longer
00:08:55.82 --> 00:09:01.34 Fundamentally right of course, are there some people that are just amazing athletes? Sure sure
00:09:01.34 --> 00:09:09.90 But 98% of the people you've just been training longer than them or you just were born a lot bigger than them or a lot stronger than them
00:09:09.98 --> 00:09:15.58 But you look at them and say you know what if this person hit if we flip this around and this person been training longer
00:09:15.58 --> 00:09:18.78 I'd be the one getting crushed right so
00:09:19.34 --> 00:09:21.34 There's that now
00:09:21.58 --> 00:09:24.06 So so yes, I treat people with respect and
00:09:24.06 --> 00:09:29.90 And my my attitude is generally to say look I don't know what they've been through so I'm gonna I'm gonna treat them that way
00:09:32.06 --> 00:09:34.06 Now that being said when
00:09:34.98 --> 00:09:40.38 Someone just throws away their potential because they lack discipline
00:09:42.38 --> 00:09:48.46 That kind of bothers me. I mean it doesn't mean that I don't respect them, but I am definitely disappointed
00:09:48.46 --> 00:09:55.26 And in conditions where there is a gross lack of discipline
00:09:55.82 --> 00:10:00.06 Just a gross lack of discipline. I do move beyond
00:10:00.62 --> 00:10:07.26 Just mere disappointment and I do get into the realm of I do not respect that person because they lack discipline so
00:10:08.86 --> 00:10:13.74 There you go so it's like a respect meter kind of thing and you're starting at the baseline
00:10:13.82 --> 00:10:17.26 Yeah, I always start with treating everyone with respect
00:10:17.26 --> 00:10:22.14 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna treat everyone with respect and if you don't
00:10:23.26 --> 00:10:25.26 You don't know who you're disrespecting
00:10:25.26 --> 00:10:26.30 Yeah, right?
00:10:26.30 --> 00:10:30.46 Who are you disrespecting I mean you could be disrespecting first of all you could be disrespecting someone that is
00:10:31.02 --> 00:10:36.62 Been through a lot that maybe you should learn from you could be you know you're walking on the street and you disrespect
00:10:36.62 --> 00:10:39.42 You could disrespect someone that's a psychopath with a gun and
00:10:40.54 --> 00:10:42.30 Now you're in a shootout with them
00:10:42.30 --> 00:10:49.42 People are getting you know, I mean you're probably gonna win if you train hard, but still in a sense might be you know bystanders
00:10:49.42 --> 00:10:54.78 You don't just don't know here you just know who people are yeah, that's a good lesson to learn from your juts human
00:10:54.78 --> 00:10:56.62 You don't know how good people are you don't know?
00:10:56.62 --> 00:11:00.54 I'm not just not just how well they train, but what have they been through that day? Yeah in their life
00:11:01.34 --> 00:11:05.74 You know you meet some people in the wrong day and there could be really a real problem. Yeah
00:11:06.38 --> 00:11:11.18 So just be careful and you know what's funny. I was thinking about this that being said my
00:11:11.18 --> 00:11:14.62 My buddy from Scotland his name is Colin and
00:11:15.66 --> 00:11:21.90 He sent me a text the other day and he was listening to the podcast and he's a very avid listener of the podcast and
00:11:23.90 --> 00:11:28.06 He said he said finally after 94 podcasts
00:11:28.06 --> 00:11:31.90 I understand what that being said means and
00:11:33.10 --> 00:11:36.06 He's right. He said that being said is
00:11:36.06 --> 00:11:46.46 Basically the verbalization of the dichotomy of leadership and of life and of things and of the world
00:11:46.78 --> 00:11:53.50 Because that means that being said is when you recognize that one side of things is balanced by another side of things
00:11:54.06 --> 00:11:59.58 And it's true and in everything there is right like you could say jutsu is the best martial art that being said
00:11:59.58 --> 00:12:07.02 If someone wrestled in college and there are 262 pounds and you're 145 pounds it's gonna be problematic for you
00:12:07.58 --> 00:12:12.06 And you could say it about leadership. Hey, it's good to be aggressive and assertive that being said
00:12:12.70 --> 00:12:17.18 If you're overly aggressive no one's gonna want to work for you so it applies across the board
00:12:17.18 --> 00:12:21.02 It says opposing forces. So I think it's a good tool
00:12:22.14 --> 00:12:25.42 To use when you think about things. What is the other side of the
00:12:25.42 --> 00:12:32.94 Argument what is the other side of the situation yeah and knowing and and studying the other side will make you understand
00:12:33.34 --> 00:12:35.34 Everything better
00:12:36.14 --> 00:12:38.14 That being said it could be very difficult
00:12:38.70 --> 00:12:41.10 Understand anything that's life really
00:12:41.66 --> 00:12:45.42 So the no expectation and I think we talk I know we talked about this before, but
00:12:46.14 --> 00:12:50.78 You say I don't have any expectations that's I have no expect very little experts
00:12:50.78 --> 00:12:56.70 So you can low expectation a lot of times people will take that as like you expect low performance out of me
00:12:56.78 --> 00:13:00.86 You know, which is different. That's different. No, yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right. You're correct
00:13:01.42 --> 00:13:05.26 Yeah, because that essentially means that you do have expectations. They're just
00:13:06.30 --> 00:13:11.42 Like negative you know I expect like low performance out of you. I expect you to do the wrong there something like that
00:13:11.42 --> 00:13:16.70 I I expect my expectations are low my hope is high. Yeah, I hope that you are out
00:13:16.70 --> 00:13:24.94 You know hardworking very diligent square away human being that's so technically so obviously you know the difference between
00:13:25.10 --> 00:13:32.30 Expecting poor performance or just having a clean slate no real expectations and I'm gonna take things the way they come
00:13:32.30 --> 00:13:37.74 Obviously, you know the difference there. So what would you call when someone says I have low expectations if you
00:13:40.38 --> 00:13:46.06 Sounds like they expect you to do jump. Yeah, that does that sounds bad. I have low expectations right so
00:13:46.06 --> 00:13:48.70 But so I guess what your hands up and say hey no expectations
00:13:49.18 --> 00:13:54.54 Okay, that sounds different. Yeah, right. I so I guess I guess my expectations are closer to the no expectations right?
00:13:54.70 --> 00:13:59.42 Yeah, I don't expect negativity. Yes, but I don't expect much either yeah when being
00:14:00.54 --> 00:14:05.66 I like to set a low bar right and then let them and let it be impressed
00:14:06.62 --> 00:14:08.06 Makes sense so it's kind of like
00:14:08.06 --> 00:14:15.66 The expectation or respect or and the respect meter is kind of this cool acceptable baseline
00:14:16.22 --> 00:14:22.30 Just fundamental stuff. Yeah, you know, don't you know whatever. Yeah, don't step on my feet on purpose the first time
00:14:22.46 --> 00:14:28.62 You know and then with every little action bigger small with every experience with that person the
00:14:28.86 --> 00:14:33.10 The meter either goes up or it goes down and it depends on the violation or the
00:14:33.10 --> 00:14:37.34 What every element that's gonna impress you right so right let's say someone
00:14:38.54 --> 00:14:44.30 It's weird now, you know how like so people we get impressed by like stuff that see it seems like you're supposed to do
00:14:44.30 --> 00:14:49.82 Did you just say we because are you talking about me too? I think so okay? I don't know that's a total assumption
00:14:49.82 --> 00:14:52.78 But like okay, are you impressed with people who keep their word?
00:14:53.58 --> 00:14:54.62 Absolutely
00:14:54.62 --> 00:14:56.62 Right, yeah, that's an example so
00:14:56.62 --> 00:15:01.98 You're supposed to keep your word. That's what your word is you keep it, you know, that's kind of what the whole
00:15:02.54 --> 00:15:05.66 Defining character is tickle so you're saying where it is you're saying
00:15:06.46 --> 00:15:10.46 Some other person might say well, I just expect people right you're supposed to do that
00:15:10.46 --> 00:15:13.82 You know remember like how Chris rock on his little stand-up thing he'd be like oh, yeah
00:15:13.82 --> 00:15:17.90 People want like credit for stuff you're supposed to do like he's like I take care of my kids
00:15:18.22 --> 00:15:20.30 So like yeah, you're supposed to take care of your kids, you know
00:15:20.78 --> 00:15:25.42 Kind of thing but when you think about it, are you impressed with someone who takes good care of their kids
00:15:25.42 --> 00:15:27.42 You kind of are right?
00:15:28.14 --> 00:15:31.98 Yeah, but that's not to say you expect them not to though
00:15:32.54 --> 00:15:38.62 Really you just you just you just have what I'm saying which is no expect close leaning towards no
00:15:38.62 --> 00:15:40.86 Expect yes, and then when you experience it
00:15:40.86 --> 00:15:43.74 You kind of follow one side of it, you know whether it be like yeah
00:15:43.74 --> 00:15:49.26 That makes me happy. It makes me happy that you're doing what you're supposed to do that's what it is right there
00:15:49.50 --> 00:15:53.10 Right pretty much like when you showed up today
00:15:53.10 --> 00:15:58.14 I was happy wait you were a head show well. Yeah
00:15:59.90 --> 00:16:04.62 What I showed up in saw you here. I was happy you were here. Yeah, but you're supposed to be here
00:16:05.18 --> 00:16:10.14 We agreed we were gonna be here right. That's happy. That's cool. I guess
00:16:11.02 --> 00:16:13.50 What I was there just stoked to see me. Oh, yeah
00:16:14.86 --> 00:16:16.86 I wasn't impressed but I was happy
00:16:18.54 --> 00:16:21.74 Okay, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it anyway
00:16:21.74 --> 00:16:25.90 Even know what you're getting the bottom two, but maybe we could do another question just your expectations and respect
00:16:25.90 --> 00:16:30.70 You know really the whole the the meticulous and specific dynamics of that
00:16:30.70 --> 00:16:36.62 That's what we're going for there. Okay. I think anyway next question cool. Yeah real cool
00:16:36.86 --> 00:16:42.54 Jockel what do I do when one of my teammates isn't really pulling their weight
00:16:43.58 --> 00:16:46.62 They used to be pretty good but things have gotten downhill
00:16:46.62 --> 00:16:51.18 How can I get how can I get them to fix themselves?
00:16:52.94 --> 00:16:54.94 It is extra tricky because he's a friend of mine
00:16:57.82 --> 00:17:04.38 Okay, well you got your your teammate slash friend. That's not pulling their weight and
00:17:05.18 --> 00:17:09.82 How do you get them back in the game first thing I'm gonna do actually the first thing I'm gonna do
00:17:10.86 --> 00:17:12.86 Is I'm gonna help them
00:17:12.86 --> 00:17:19.18 I'm gonna help I'm gonna take some weight off of their shoulders. I'm gonna I'm gonna actually step in and say oh
00:17:19.18 --> 00:17:23.50 Hey echo you know you got that that project working on and you know with that little time and you got
00:17:23.50 --> 00:17:26.06 Hey, I got to how I'm gonna stay at the office a little bit late tonight anyways
00:17:26.06 --> 00:17:28.22 I'm gonna knock you just give that to me. I'll just hammer it out tonight
00:17:28.22 --> 00:17:31.18 I'm gonna be here anyways because I got to pick up my kids late from school. Is that cool?
00:17:31.90 --> 00:17:33.58 Just take a little way off sure
00:17:33.58 --> 00:17:35.34 Just do what you can you know maybe just
00:17:35.98 --> 00:17:42.54 Carey some how do you know what that person's got going on at home? Yeah, right? What are you gonna jump right down there throat and get all of them
00:17:42.54 --> 00:17:49.26 Their face make it worse and get things worse when actually that person has a sick kid or has a problem with their
00:17:49.50 --> 00:17:53.90 Husband or wife or whatever and now we're getting in their face and getting their grill about it
00:17:54.30 --> 00:17:56.94 No, I'm just gonna lean in and give them dim a hand
00:17:57.82 --> 00:18:03.58 That that seems like what a good teammate would do especially if the person's your friend so get in there and hopefully
00:18:04.86 --> 00:18:07.18 They'll say hey hey thanks
00:18:07.18 --> 00:18:11.98 You know what I got this problem at home or thanks. I got this health issue going on. I do hey no problem
00:18:11.98 --> 00:18:15.66 That's and guess what we just built a little relationship. We did on that a little bit tighter
00:18:15.82 --> 00:18:20.14 We were friends now we're even a little bit tighter friends. Yeah, so that's a positive thing now
00:18:20.46 --> 00:18:22.46 There's also a chance of course that
00:18:23.10 --> 00:18:26.78 Well and to continue down that story eventually they get healthier
00:18:26.78 --> 00:18:32.86 Are they solve the problem at home and they get back in the game and then we're all good and guess who the next person that might need a little assistance?
00:18:32.86 --> 00:18:33.82 It might be you
00:18:33.82 --> 00:18:39.58 You might be the one with a problem with a health issue with the sick family member or whatever and you're the one that might have to lean on them
00:18:39.58 --> 00:18:42.94 You want them to get in your face and start yelling at you about pulling your weight
00:18:43.26 --> 00:18:47.10 Or do you just want them to say hey I got I got some capacity right now. Let me help you out
00:18:47.58 --> 00:18:53.98 Yeah, right it's it's so clear how you want to handle that number one you just want to take some ownership of what's going on
00:18:54.70 --> 00:18:59.74 Now there is also the chance that once they've come back or it or that you you help them out and they like
00:18:59.98 --> 00:19:02.30 Start looking at you and saying oh, you know
00:19:03.18 --> 00:19:05.18 Jocco's just gonna do all my work for me
00:19:05.18 --> 00:19:10.38 Jocco's just gonna you know I can just lean on him. He's just gonna do everything. Oh, I gave him one task
00:19:10.38 --> 00:19:13.42 I'll get all let them do this other tasks that I've decided. I let him do another task. I'm gonna sign
00:19:15.66 --> 00:19:18.94 And if people start giving me their work to do good
00:19:20.30 --> 00:19:23.82 I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do their work. I'm gonna do their work
00:19:24.30 --> 00:19:28.86 And if they want to me to do all of their work. I'll do all their work and eventually they won't have a job anymore
00:19:29.58 --> 00:19:31.58 and then I'll take their job
00:19:31.58 --> 00:19:39.58 And then I'll have I'll get promoted and I'll hire more people that are gonna do the right thing and get after it, right?
00:19:40.06 --> 00:19:42.06 So that's okay
00:19:42.06 --> 00:19:46.54 When somebody wants to put themselves on report for being lazy
00:19:47.26 --> 00:19:49.98 By allowing you to do work their work for them
00:19:50.54 --> 00:19:53.18 Allow them to fill out that report in full detail
00:19:55.10 --> 00:20:00.06 And and the other thing is so then do you do you jump up and down and say look I'm doing Echo's job look
00:20:00.06 --> 00:20:03.90 Come to no no no no you don't do that you don't do that you don't need to do that
00:20:04.62 --> 00:20:09.50 You may want to do it because you feel like you need to do it, but you don't sure you the recognition will come
00:20:10.22 --> 00:20:15.26 You just need to be patient of course on top of all this there is some
00:20:16.14 --> 00:20:22.62 Indirect coaching that you can do to turn it up speed you know as opposed to saying your screw-up echo and said you say
00:20:22.62 --> 00:20:26.14 Hey Echo I got some extra capacity with what's going on. It's or anything I can do to help you out
00:20:26.14 --> 00:20:31.74 You know you know is there any support that you need because I know you you're this part of the task is a little bit bigger than mine and so
00:20:31.98 --> 00:20:33.98 You know is there anything I can do to help you get the job done?
00:20:35.02 --> 00:20:37.02 You need any support for me
00:20:37.02 --> 00:20:42.38 Because I'm actually elevating you a little bit by saying your task is harboring challenging and bigger and more important
00:20:43.18 --> 00:20:45.18 Or you can also say hey
00:20:45.90 --> 00:20:50.22 Is there anything we should we need from the boss to to help us down here?
00:20:50.22 --> 00:20:57.98 Then he's supported we should get from up the chain of command because I think if we go to the unified front we could get some help. I'm I'm actually feeling pretty good about my area of
00:20:58.06 --> 00:21:01.82 Responsibilities, but are you feeling good about yours because if not maybe you need some more support
00:21:01.82 --> 00:21:04.78 We could get it from if we go to the boss as a unified front make it happen and
00:21:06.14 --> 00:21:10.38 Then you say oh yeah, we know what I got this and I need another person or I need some more man-hours or whatever the case
00:21:10.38 --> 00:21:12.38 Maybe we get you moving in the right direction
00:21:14.94 --> 00:21:16.94 And that's it
00:21:16.94 --> 00:21:19.74 What if they're just lacking they're just lacking cool
00:21:19.74 --> 00:21:23.02 Let them slide yeah, let them slide yeah, let them slide there's also there's also a thing where
00:21:24.14 --> 00:21:28.70 A lot of times when I come and take you work from you if you're not just a turd you'll be like
00:21:29.26 --> 00:21:33.10 Like hey, you know jocco you did this last week. I got it man. It's no problem
00:21:33.74 --> 00:21:40.46 You you as a human being will feel like you're not carrying the weight for the tribe and when human beings feel like they're not carrying the weight for the tribe
00:21:40.46 --> 00:21:45.90 They they want to help they feel like they're not gonna get their their peace of meat
00:21:46.38 --> 00:21:47.90 Right, so they want to help out
00:21:47.90 --> 00:21:52.46 You know you've ever seen that you know, that's what your mom used to do to you when you were kid
00:21:52.94 --> 00:21:57.58 Just they just be cleaning you something you got it. You feel like okay
00:21:58.78 --> 00:22:04.54 I need to help yeah 100% or you'll see you know your wife but wife will do that to you
00:22:04.54 --> 00:22:08.38 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I still do that to me all the time actually every single time so you know how like
00:22:09.50 --> 00:22:12.06 You know I don't know Saturday comes, you know
00:22:12.46 --> 00:22:14.46 We don't have any plans on Saturday
00:22:14.46 --> 00:22:16.46 so I'm cruising and
00:22:16.46 --> 00:22:21.50 My way starts taking on this kind of big cleaning project the garage
00:22:21.50 --> 00:22:24.14 Hmm whatever. I don't know garage in my case
00:22:25.10 --> 00:22:27.10 And then she'll kind of walk to be like hey
00:22:27.50 --> 00:22:31.10 You know, what do you want me to do with this thing that I found in the back corner of the garage?
00:22:31.10 --> 00:22:32.38 What do you want to do with this?
00:22:32.38 --> 00:22:34.14 And then three minutes later she back what do you want me to do with this?
00:22:34.14 --> 00:22:35.18 Yeah
00:22:35.18 --> 00:22:38.30 Yeah, well, no well, yeah, of course that happens all the time
00:22:38.62 --> 00:22:42.54 But as far as the example for this the comparison is she'll be like
00:22:42.54 --> 00:22:50.62 Hey, can you clean out this whole thing right here and I'll be like oh, yeah, you know like I didn't really plan on that whole big project right now
00:22:50.86 --> 00:22:52.62 So you know, maybe I'm kind of doing this
00:22:52.86 --> 00:22:54.14 Unimportant thing or whatever
00:22:54.14 --> 00:22:57.26 I'll be like yeah, I'll do it in a few minutes, but then I'll see her doing it
00:22:57.82 --> 00:23:00.38 Oh yeah, I'm seeing and then doing my work about all right
00:23:00.38 --> 00:23:07.26 I gotta do it. I can't let her do my job because it's kind of my job now. Yeah well one time my wife on the opposite on the spectrum
00:23:07.74 --> 00:23:10.78 We were planning to redo my backyard a little bit
00:23:10.78 --> 00:23:20.22 And we were gonna put in like a five foot retaining wall with you know concrete block and dig a foundation and all that
00:23:21.02 --> 00:23:26.06 And then re backfill the soil to fill it up to the level of the five foot retaining wall and
00:23:26.86 --> 00:23:29.98 So I kind of talked about my wife with you know, I was gonna you know, hey, with this
00:23:29.98 --> 00:23:33.42 So what we're gonna do we're gonna build this retaining wall with some steps here or then it'll be good
00:23:33.42 --> 00:23:39.66 We can backfill we'll have a level yard to be really nice and so to then like on a Sunday at like
00:23:40.78 --> 00:23:42.78 One o'clock in the afternoon
00:23:43.10 --> 00:23:45.98 She's like well, why don't you build that retaining wall today?
00:23:49.34 --> 00:23:53.18 You know it was like you know, it's a little late in the day to for me to start that project
00:23:53.34 --> 00:23:57.02 Right now. Why you gotta get it all done because this was like a nine-day project
00:23:57.58 --> 00:24:01.50 That's why oh she wanted you to build it right in there. Hey, what are you doing this afternoon
00:24:01.50 --> 00:24:08.14 If you don't do anything how much of build a five foot concrete block retaining wall over here with drainage and then backfill and put saw down
00:24:08.14 --> 00:24:11.98 That sounds like something you could do in the afternoon. Yeah, hurry up. Oh, it's your week
00:24:16.78 --> 00:24:18.78 Next question
00:24:18.78 --> 00:24:24.22 I'm not talking that good into my microphone whichever
00:24:25.98 --> 00:24:30.86 Jocco I'm a high school teacher. I consider myself the leader in the classroom
00:24:31.82 --> 00:24:40.22 How do I demonstrate extreme ownership in the classroom for example one of my students miss behaves how do I take extreme ownership of their behavior?
00:24:43.18 --> 00:24:45.18 Okay one way to do this and
00:24:45.18 --> 00:24:51.10 And I do this with my kids. I did it with my puttune guys
00:24:53.50 --> 00:25:01.58 Do it with jiu-jitsu kids whoever and what you do is you do exactly what you're saying you want to do which is you take ownership
00:25:02.06 --> 00:25:09.10 So what that means is you take ownership of their behavior so when something goes when the kids miss behaving
00:25:09.10 --> 00:25:13.98 You say hey, what am I not making clear to you?
00:25:14.70 --> 00:25:20.94 That you continue to act like this because obviously I must be doing something wrong because I'm the teacher and you're in here acting like an idiot and
00:25:21.26 --> 00:25:24.30 Disrupting everything what am I not doing well?
00:25:24.70 --> 00:25:28.70 How could I convey this message to you that that you should not like that?
00:25:28.70 --> 00:25:33.58 I'm not only that, but how can I better make you understand that what you do right now is going to
00:25:33.98 --> 00:25:36.38 affect and impact the rest of your whole life
00:25:36.38 --> 00:25:41.82 Because I want you I'm supposed to convey that to you as a person that
00:25:43.82 --> 00:25:49.66 If you get engaged in class you're going to have a more successful and better life and that's what my
00:25:50.06 --> 00:25:55.58 Kind of goal is and so what I want to know is how I can better explain to you
00:25:57.58 --> 00:26:00.86 That your behavior while you're in here from
00:26:00.86 --> 00:26:12.54 Classroom attendance to having big outbursts of skipping class to not turning in your homework to failing tests all those behaviors that you kind of display on a regular basis
00:26:13.26 --> 00:26:16.14 I need to find a better way to
00:26:16.70 --> 00:26:23.02 Explain to you that the way you are acting right now will absolutely dictate where you're going to be in the future
00:26:24.46 --> 00:26:27.02 And it in by the way, it's not a positive thing
00:26:27.02 --> 00:26:33.26 It's not a positive thing at all your life is going in the wrong direction and as a teacher
00:26:33.26 --> 00:26:38.46 I'm supposed to move it in the right direction. So what do you think I could do better to help you understand that?
00:26:41.34 --> 00:26:44.38 So there we go that's that's that's what that's one method
00:26:45.26 --> 00:26:50.70 And by the way, I've used that with my kids too. That's a very effective method for parenting is isn't
00:26:51.42 --> 00:26:53.42 Why did you not clean your room?
00:26:53.42 --> 00:26:58.30 It's how did I fail as a father to
00:26:59.42 --> 00:27:06.22 To make you understand that basic fundamental hygiene is a positive thing
00:27:07.98 --> 00:27:09.98 Where did I where did I fail?
00:27:11.10 --> 00:27:15.10 And that's actually the cleaning room example is in a great one, but when it's something a little bit more
00:27:15.10 --> 00:27:22.06 Sivier than that something like when they really do something that's outside the lines right
00:27:23.26 --> 00:27:28.62 And you say instead of saying you know you went outside the lines you're messed up instead you say
00:27:30.22 --> 00:27:31.98 I'm sorry that I
00:27:32.94 --> 00:27:40.54 Couldn't convey to you the importance of these lines and why we don't go out them and now now now I'm looking at you and I'm thinking
00:27:40.54 --> 00:27:44.86 I don't know what mistakes I made and I let you down as a as a father
00:27:45.58 --> 00:27:49.42 Because clearly you don't understand the boundaries of of what is good and what is bad
00:27:50.22 --> 00:27:52.22 And I feel like I let you down and
00:27:53.10 --> 00:27:57.66 That for my kids provokes a better reaction than you that you screwed up. Yeah, yeah
00:27:59.66 --> 00:28:01.66 Now
00:28:01.66 --> 00:28:10.06 If going on the other thing you can do here is you can explain how their behavior affects and impacts everyone else in the class and
00:28:10.86 --> 00:28:16.38 That you as the teacher is not only responsible for their behavior which you are but you're also
00:28:16.78 --> 00:28:18.78 Responsible for teaching every single person in the class
00:28:20.46 --> 00:28:28.22 And and that you own that you own the education of these other kids and that you're not gonna let one kid
00:28:28.22 --> 00:28:35.42 Distroy the experience for everyone else because that is not fair and you will not do it
00:28:35.82 --> 00:28:41.58 I'm not gonna let that happen not gonna let you come in here and impact all these other kids with your negativity and your bad behavior
00:28:41.82 --> 00:28:44.86 These kids are here to learn they actually want to do something with their lives
00:28:45.66 --> 00:28:48.06 They want to take over and dominate they want to win
00:28:49.42 --> 00:28:53.10 And I'm looking at you and I think you must want to lose because that's what that's where you're heading
00:28:54.46 --> 00:28:56.86 That's what you want to do is lose in life
00:28:56.86 --> 00:28:58.54 Because these other kids they want to win
00:28:59.90 --> 00:29:04.46 So I'm not gonna let that happen. I'm not gonna let them lose because you want to lose if you want to lose
00:29:04.46 --> 00:29:07.10 You can go do it on your own time in the principal's office
00:29:09.34 --> 00:29:13.90 And then you maybe you have to kick them out of class, maybe you have to suspend them for or whatever and
00:29:17.82 --> 00:29:21.66 I think that then you have to let people understand that just like you take ownership
00:29:21.66 --> 00:29:26.70 They should take ownership of their lives, right? That's the fundamental thing that you're getting at and
00:29:29.50 --> 00:29:33.66 Lastly, and this is something that I think is very hard for young kids to understand
00:29:34.78 --> 00:29:38.30 Young kids meaning the ages between like 15 and 20
00:29:39.58 --> 00:29:44.78 Maybe 25 some kids get it earlier, you know some kids understand it earlier, but
00:29:44.78 --> 00:29:53.82 Understanding this thread of this thread of the passage of your life and that the way that you act right now
00:29:55.26 --> 00:30:01.90 Effects the way you're gonna be in a week in a month a year in five years and ten years and kids do not
00:30:02.22 --> 00:30:08.46 Understand that they do not understand. I didn't understand it when I was 10 12 15 18 30
00:30:08.46 --> 00:30:16.06 You know what I mean like well, I think I think actually what one of the things one of the best things for me
00:30:16.62 --> 00:30:23.02 Is that when you join the military they show you that thread and it's very clear they're like hey you do this and you get promoted
00:30:23.02 --> 00:30:26.70 You do this and you get advanced you get this and you get your paycheck
00:30:26.70 --> 00:30:29.98 You get this oh and you do this other thing you don't get a paycheck
00:30:29.98 --> 00:30:36.78 You didn't do this other thing you go to the brick you do this other thing and you will you'll won't make it through seal trading
00:30:36.78 --> 00:30:39.58 Yeah, so you know that was for me
00:30:39.58 --> 00:30:41.58 I shouldn't have said get promoted because for me it was
00:30:41.98 --> 00:30:47.10 Get too seal training and get through seal training. I didn't care about getting promoted. I never did
00:30:47.66 --> 00:30:54.22 But to get when I was 18 years old to get too seal training and to get through seal training
00:30:54.46 --> 00:30:58.70 That was a crystal clear path for me and I saw it and as soon as I saw it
00:30:58.70 --> 00:31:03.02 I said okay, I will not veer off that path what they tell me to do. I'll do now
00:31:03.02 --> 00:31:08.22 There's nothing that's that solid for a civilian right first civilian to say okay if you do this right now
00:31:08.22 --> 00:31:12.94 You're gonna get into this college. Yeah, if you get into this college and you get these kind of grades
00:31:12.94 --> 00:31:19.74 You're gonna get this kind of job. There's no real clear path like that and so it's harder to draw that thread for people
00:31:20.14 --> 00:31:22.78 But I think you can do it. I think you can show examples of
00:31:23.82 --> 00:31:30.94 Of where you end up in the societal structure based on your behavior as a teenage person a teenage human yeah
00:31:30.94 --> 00:31:32.94 Yeah, that's gonna be hard
00:31:33.58 --> 00:31:39.42 Just straight up. That's just gonna be hard for a teacher because because of the time constraints like that or the time
00:31:39.74 --> 00:31:46.62 Limitation you have with it with it kid. Yeah, I think one thing that is I've done with with my kids
00:31:47.26 --> 00:31:54.06 Is I look at other human beings in the world with them and I explain to them that that's a person
00:31:54.94 --> 00:31:58.94 That's a person. I was talking about this with my son. It left such an impact on him
00:31:58.94 --> 00:32:05.42 Yesterday we were down at the beach early morning one time years ago. He was probably probably eight years old
00:32:05.82 --> 00:32:11.74 We were going surfing waves were good by the way. It was a big day. Hell yeah, we got done and so now it's
00:32:12.46 --> 00:32:14.46 7.38 o'clock in the morning and
00:32:14.94 --> 00:32:17.98 There's a guy that's a obvious drug
00:32:17.98 --> 00:32:28.22 Induced state of mayhem and he's got five cops and they get him down and we're watching this whole thing and he's yelling swearing
00:32:29.02 --> 00:32:32.38 And they put a spit bag on his head
00:32:33.02 --> 00:32:39.66 So he's just full on crazy and you know my son saying what is that dad? You know, it's like, oh, that's a spit bag
00:32:39.82 --> 00:32:43.34 So that this guy doesn't spit on these police officers that are down here doing their job
00:32:43.34 --> 00:32:47.98 And I said this is what happens when you go on drugs
00:32:48.54 --> 00:32:52.62 This is where you end up you end up with no shirt on one shoe
00:32:53.50 --> 00:32:59.58 RIP jeans you you have a spit bag on your head your handcuffed and you're going to jail
00:33:00.22 --> 00:33:03.50 That's where you end up. That's where the path leads so
00:33:04.30 --> 00:33:08.78 Don't do those things don't don't start down that path and it's the same thing you know
00:33:08.78 --> 00:33:10.78 it's with my daughter and
00:33:10.78 --> 00:33:13.90 And we saw what do we see?
00:33:15.18 --> 00:33:21.66 I was pointing out to her again someone a woman that clearly didn't have a place to live
00:33:22.86 --> 00:33:26.86 You know she was a homeless person and I
00:33:27.74 --> 00:33:32.70 You know walking with my daughter and we see the woman with the shopping cart and it's filled with you know stuff
00:33:33.34 --> 00:33:38.06 Crap and sleeping bags and cans and whatever clearly a homeless person
00:33:38.06 --> 00:33:42.46 But the was weird and the reason I specifically point out was because she looked
00:33:43.90 --> 00:33:46.86 somewhat you know somewhat normal and
00:33:49.42 --> 00:33:55.66 Yet you could tell that she was not doing well and so you know I said to my daughter I said
00:33:57.50 --> 00:34:02.70 What do you think of of that person and she's obsessed? I don't know what do you mean? I said well
00:34:02.94 --> 00:34:04.94 Do you think that person wants to be there?
00:34:04.94 --> 00:34:08.94 And she said well, well, no, I said well, how do you think she ended up there?
00:34:09.58 --> 00:34:12.46 And she said I don't know and I said you know I don't know not I don't know either
00:34:13.18 --> 00:34:17.74 But that's a real person and when she goes to bed tonight she's gonna be underneath the bridge somewhere
00:34:17.82 --> 00:34:21.10 She's gonna be cold. She's gonna be wet. She's gonna be miserable and
00:34:21.50 --> 00:34:24.54 That is how that's her life. That's where she ended up
00:34:25.34 --> 00:34:26.54 So
00:34:26.54 --> 00:34:30.70 Some choices that she made along the way may have contributed to that
00:34:30.70 --> 00:34:38.86 And what I'm saying to you is make choices that will contribute to you not ending up in that position
00:34:39.74 --> 00:34:43.98 Because those people that you see that are homeless that are addicted to drugs
00:34:44.54 --> 00:34:47.58 Those people are actually people and
00:34:47.82 --> 00:34:54.38 You can it's very easy to view them as oh, I can never be there. They're not they're different species than me
00:34:54.78 --> 00:34:56.14 They're not
00:34:56.14 --> 00:35:00.94 That's I guess that's the that's the point of my story is that it's really easy
00:35:01.58 --> 00:35:09.10 For people to look at other people and think that's not I could never be there that could not happen to me and my point to my kids is
00:35:09.26 --> 00:35:12.30 Oh, yes, it can if you make the wrong choices
00:35:12.62 --> 00:35:16.86 Good, hey, you know what you could be bad luck sure it could be bad luck. It can be bad luck
00:35:17.34 --> 00:35:25.58 But most of the time the vast majority of time it's decision making bad decision making gets you in bad situations and by the way
00:35:25.58 --> 00:35:32.14 People that go off the path and and then they said you know what I screwed up I
00:35:33.74 --> 00:35:38.78 Did the wrong thing and I'm gonna now fix it that's you don't see people like that that are homeless
00:35:38.78 --> 00:35:43.42 You don't see people like that with that are addicted to drugs because they take responsibility and they say okay
00:35:43.42 --> 00:35:44.94 I made this mistake
00:35:44.94 --> 00:35:46.70 I didn't do the right things
00:35:46.70 --> 00:35:49.66 I need to get fixed and they fix it
00:35:49.66 --> 00:35:54.14 Whereas someone that says oh, it's my parents fault and it's my
00:35:54.14 --> 00:36:00.30 Boyfriends fault and it's my girlfriends fault and it's my old boss's fault and it's my pushers fault and
00:36:01.10 --> 00:36:04.70 Whoever you want to blame it's and if it's not your fault you don't have you don't fix the problem
00:36:05.42 --> 00:36:09.26 You don't take ownership of the problem you don't fix it on a personal level and that's problematic
00:36:11.26 --> 00:36:16.94 You parents were teachers, huh? Yes, both teachers. Yeah
00:36:16.94 --> 00:36:24.46 Makes out there's a lot of it seems like there's a lot of similarities with teachers and then parents
00:36:24.46 --> 00:36:29.42 Right because it's both like you're both trying to guide these young minds to buy the way kids
00:36:30.14 --> 00:36:32.78 Teenagers whatever, yeah, they can't
00:36:33.90 --> 00:36:38.38 Really have you know, I say they don't understand the correlation between like their actions now
00:36:38.38 --> 00:36:42.94 Right they kind of can't because that part of their brain isn't developed yet the front part
00:36:42.94 --> 00:36:46.70 Front all whatever it's called the front part that's a front part
00:36:47.82 --> 00:36:50.86 It's a medical term but it tends to
00:36:51.98 --> 00:36:53.98 An average or whatever
00:36:54.14 --> 00:37:01.18 Develop by age 25 that's why is it 25 okay, so that's typically you know give or take when it when it's done developing
00:37:01.42 --> 00:37:04.30 So yeah before that and it's basically the decision making like okay
00:37:04.30 --> 00:37:08.62 What I just what you said what I do now affects the future and you know like now you're like oh
00:37:08.62 --> 00:37:14.22 When you do something you can almost feel the payoff in the future. It's almost like that you understand it
00:37:14.22 --> 00:37:19.58 No back then you couldn't that's why these colleges it when you go to college at 18 or 17 in my case
00:37:19.90 --> 00:37:23.02 They all the all these credit card little credit card pushers
00:37:23.34 --> 00:37:27.74 They'll just post up outside of your dorm room and be like hey un- unsecured
00:37:27.74 --> 00:37:29.74 I don't even know what unsecured means by the way at this time
00:37:30.46 --> 00:37:36.78 $300 limit just credits free money free money. That's how they all you got to do is feel about this thing and everyone of course
00:37:36.78 --> 00:37:40.30 Of course, I don't know what that means. I'll pay it back a way later
00:37:40.46 --> 00:37:42.46 So they get you like that, but nonetheless
00:37:42.86 --> 00:37:48.62 Yeah, so they don't have that part of their brain. They don't know yeah, so the answer is and I'm kind of
00:37:49.74 --> 00:37:51.34 Drawing from
00:37:51.34 --> 00:37:56.86 My childhood so I had these two teachers right one teachers and he was mr. Tokita
00:37:57.58 --> 00:38:01.10 Japanese guy and he was like a little samurai ninja guy
00:38:01.10 --> 00:38:07.02 Didn't really talk that much like outside of the classroom and when he talked in the classroom it was all deliberate stuff
00:38:07.02 --> 00:38:11.82 There was no small talk. It was really rigid. We had a quiz every single Friday every single Friday
00:38:12.30 --> 00:38:15.34 10 questions real short quiz about the weak stuff
00:38:15.82 --> 00:38:19.02 His little lecture on the board was like boom boom boom boom boom
00:38:19.02 --> 00:38:24.62 I think he'd even underlying the key points, you know, so you'd know there was it there was no like hey
00:38:24.62 --> 00:38:29.42 Read this and I'm gonna know mr. No mystery. This is what you can be that he underlying the key points
00:38:29.42 --> 00:38:32.54 And you got to know those key points at the end of the week test every week
00:38:33.26 --> 00:38:37.10 Boom you take or quiz it's a quiz then there's a test on all this stuff whatever
00:38:37.42 --> 00:38:38.70 But you were not
00:38:38.70 --> 00:38:43.70 It'll equipped for these tests you knew as long as you're showing up in a ten-year-year-old
00:38:43.70 --> 00:38:48.94 So either you did it or you didn't do it, you know, so it was and there was no like hey guys
00:38:48.94 --> 00:38:53.50 Nothing like you could you knew what to expect this guy was so consistent with every every little thing
00:38:53.50 --> 00:38:58.82 All the way down to the point that like if you call him Tokita because sometimes that's how you know when you get real
00:38:58.82 --> 00:39:01.70 Chummy with it with the teachers just in general if you're that kind of person
00:39:02.66 --> 00:39:07.10 You won't say mr. or Mrs. Right so something everyone saw you'd be like hey
00:39:07.74 --> 00:39:12.14 I don't know Smith we'll just say if the teacher saying was Mrs. Smith. He'd be like hey, Smith and you know
00:39:12.14 --> 00:39:16.28 It's a kind of chummy relationship so one time I forget it was
00:39:16.90 --> 00:39:19.22 Why the end is grow classy anyway?
00:39:19.22 --> 00:39:23.18 Because all Tukita cuz you like don't mean he was a likable guy. That's the thing
00:39:23.18 --> 00:39:31.66 But um, but just really consistent and rigid like a ninja or something and they were like hey Tokita and ask a question
00:39:31.66 --> 00:39:36.74 And he didn't get mad not like that he just answers a corral stoic this answers the question and as he's
00:39:37.54 --> 00:39:43.14 Shuffling his papers like this just real like this guy was so cold cold his ice guy
00:39:43.14 --> 00:39:49.62 Because like if pull me answers a question and it goes and that's mr. Tokita and they need just continues on right?
00:39:49.62 --> 00:39:51.62 And it wants like dang that was fucking awesome
00:39:51.62 --> 00:39:53.62 But anyway
00:39:53.62 --> 00:39:54.62 I
00:39:54.62 --> 00:39:59.62 Did the best in that class because it was one of those things that it was so consistent
00:39:59.62 --> 00:40:02.62 Like there was no room for slack if if you slacked off
00:40:02.62 --> 00:40:07.42 It was really apparent discipline equals freedom. Yeah, you know, but he wasn't the kind like he wouldn't yell at you
00:40:07.42 --> 00:40:14.62 It wasn't that how don't yell? Yeah, so discipline equals freedom. You don't need it yell when people understand expectations
00:40:14.62 --> 00:40:19.30 Yeah, media and the thing and you're like this to where you're real consistent. That's the thing too
00:40:19.30 --> 00:40:26.66 Because you know something let's say you're real rigid one week and then the next bad or let's say you're you're really rigid like the whole year and then
00:40:26.66 --> 00:40:29.30 I don't know you're not you're feeling I don't know you're hung over something
00:40:29.30 --> 00:40:32.30 I don't know you party or something you come to class as the teacher by them
00:40:32.30 --> 00:40:38.34 Oh, and then you're not as rigid that day. Oh, there's the little there's the little chink in your in your armor there
00:40:38.34 --> 00:40:40.82 And they'll kind of start to exploit it these kids
00:40:41.78 --> 00:40:45.86 Which brings me to my second teacher not gonna say his name who's in seventh grade though
00:40:45.86 --> 00:40:51.58 Where this guy was just all over the place super easy to take advantage of this guy is a music teacher wait
00:40:52.94 --> 00:40:54.94 Yeah, I think so I don't forget, but
00:40:55.58 --> 00:41:00.70 Super easy to take advantage of this guy the kind like he glues his cool all the time and you know
00:41:00.70 --> 00:41:03.46 It was just funny to see him react a lot of the time right and
00:41:04.10 --> 00:41:09.74 He was the thing is he didn't start like that. He started just super nice just like hey the kind of like people would run over him
00:41:09.74 --> 00:41:12.70 And he'd be like hey, you know, you don't have to he was just super nice
00:41:12.70 --> 00:41:16.86 But it wasn't consistent with anything then after a while I think it was after like a few years
00:41:17.98 --> 00:41:22.90 I hear that he's like really mean no yeah, like he loses his temper all the time
00:41:22.90 --> 00:41:28.10 Yeah, it goes back to just discipline it was freedom
00:41:28.10 --> 00:41:33.72 Yeah, and if you would have held the line in the beginning and said no, no, you don't act like that in here stop
00:41:34.42 --> 00:41:39.70 then if you would have stopped at the minimal or at this small
00:41:39.70 --> 00:41:40.90 All
00:41:40.90 --> 00:41:46.30 Action that was bad this this small bad behavior if he tightened that up then it would never get to bid
00:41:46.30 --> 00:41:49.34 Then he doesn't have to lose his temper and get crazy and I'm sure he's a nice guy
00:41:49.34 --> 00:41:53.98 I'm sure he's a positive guy and he had the highest hopes and expectations going back to the earlier subject
00:41:53.98 --> 00:42:00.30 He had the really high hopes that everyone's gonna be in here to learn and and open their minds and it's like no
00:42:00.30 --> 00:42:06.36 These kids are in here to shoot spit balls and stick pencils into the back of the person sitting in front of them
00:42:06.36 --> 00:42:11.64 Right, yes, that sort of it that's sort of it and
00:42:12.28 --> 00:42:17.96 When you realize that then you don't allow that minimal behavior and then they don't get totally out of control
00:42:17.96 --> 00:42:19.16 Yeah
00:42:19.16 --> 00:42:24.56 Man, the hard work being a teacher very much so very much so cuz again like because
00:42:26.28 --> 00:42:31.08 It goes back to that thing man where we're you only have like what an hour or something
00:42:31.08 --> 00:42:36.84 Before they find that it's yeah in a day and that's only for like five days maximum for the week
00:42:36.84 --> 00:42:42.60 Sometimes less you know, you've got all of these whatever and then they go home or wherever and then they get their
00:42:42.60 --> 00:42:46.68 Influences, you know, boom, boom as they grow up then they come back to your class with all that influence
00:42:46.68 --> 00:42:50.88 It's like what what now, you know, and you got to kind of find a way as a teacher
00:42:51.48 --> 00:42:57.56 Not only to like get through to them just person to person, but you got to get them all this material
00:42:57.56 --> 00:43:02.32 And if they don't like that material, oh man, that's yet another task, you know
00:43:02.32 --> 00:43:07.60 So again, man, if you have that that structure and it's consistent and they know what to expect
00:43:07.60 --> 00:43:10.80 That's gonna help because they have this scaffolding. They don't know how to make this you know
00:43:10.80 --> 00:43:14.20 I got asked one time on by a teacher. It's kind of a similar question
00:43:14.20 --> 00:43:18.60 You know I've done everything to get through this person that they're just not they're not getting in the game
00:43:18.60 --> 00:43:21.88 It what what do I do now? I was like try a different way
00:43:22.56 --> 00:43:25.76 Try a different way you know you didn't get through to them that way try a different way
00:43:25.76 --> 00:43:30.92 How can you get through now just like as a boss as a leader as a platoon commander
00:43:30.92 --> 00:43:37.96 If you've tried every single possible different way and you've got someone that just cannot do it or does not want to do it
00:43:37.96 --> 00:43:42.48 And they're negatively affecting everyone else then it's your responsibility as a leader to get rid of them
00:43:44.24 --> 00:43:48.76 Get rid of them and had another conversation with a teacher one time who had
00:43:48.76 --> 00:43:55.76 kicked someone out of her school for fighting and I
00:43:56.32 --> 00:44:00.40 And this this person's a great person and a friend of mine
00:44:00.40 --> 00:44:06.64 She kicked someone out of the school and we met at a dinner and we were just talking and and I said
00:44:06.64 --> 00:44:08.16 All how's everything going she goes well, you know
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:10.40 I just kicked this person out of school and I was like oh, what's the situation?
00:44:10.40 --> 00:44:15.64 And she's well, you know, it's this guy this kid and he's been a good kid
00:44:15.64 --> 00:44:19.80 He doesn't come from a great home, but he got into a fight and he hid another kid
00:44:19.80 --> 00:44:24.48 And I just have no we can't have that at school at all and so me being a jerk
00:44:24.48 --> 00:44:28.84 I was like oh, so you just destroyed his life basically and
00:44:29.56 --> 00:44:31.48 She and you know and she said what do you mean?
00:44:31.48 --> 00:44:34.96 I go well if the kid doesn't have much of a home and he's not coming from a great family
00:44:34.96 --> 00:44:38.56 The only thing he has is your school and if you don't allow him in school and now you kicked him out
00:44:38.56 --> 00:44:39.36 Where's he in end up?
00:44:39.36 --> 00:44:43.96 I go did you did you already open up a space woman prison somewhere because that's where he's headed
00:44:43.96 --> 00:44:48.60 And I was just I was being a total jerk, but I didn't really do this until I saw her like getting emotional
00:44:48.60 --> 00:44:52.76 And I was like oh, I'm sorry and and so then we had the conversation and
00:44:54.32 --> 00:44:56.32 What was great was
00:44:56.32 --> 00:44:59.32 We talked and and we went through this conversation and
00:45:00.52 --> 00:45:04.12 Because what I was saying even though I was being a jerk about it even though it was being kind of
00:45:04.12 --> 00:45:08.40 I don't know I wasn't being sarcastic. I was just being really really offensive because she's a friend
00:45:08.40 --> 00:45:11.48 You know and we I've that's dessert. How I am like when you're sealed
00:45:11.48 --> 00:45:18.28 Exactly treated her like another seal but then we talked and I said look but even though I'm I don't mean to be a jerk
00:45:18.28 --> 00:45:22.52 I'm I'm telling like what I believe to be the truth cracking
00:45:22.52 --> 00:45:28.58 But you have a great school you have this great opportunity for these kids and this kid who has been well behaved
00:45:28.58 --> 00:45:33.72 Was oh and this was the other critical part the kid that he got in a fight with the kid that he punched
00:45:33.72 --> 00:45:36.92 He's soccer punch the guy not soccer punch, but through the first punch
00:45:36.92 --> 00:45:45.32 The other kid was the class jerk the class picking on people and always miss behaving that kid didn't get kicked out of the school
00:45:45.32 --> 00:45:47.72 He wasn't gonna get kicked out of the school because he didn't actually
00:45:48.44 --> 00:45:50.60 Get involved in the physical violence
00:45:50.60 --> 00:45:54.68 Yeah, and so then and I told her that to I said look you got one kid that
00:45:55.72 --> 00:46:01.80 He finally broke mentally and you got another kid that just knows how to push people's buttons and he wanted him to hit him
00:46:01.80 --> 00:46:04.04 And now you're kicking the kid out that actually
00:46:04.04 --> 00:46:09.08 We probably should have done what he did he that kid probably deserved to get punched in the face and
00:46:10.52 --> 00:46:12.52 And anyways after this long conversation
00:46:12.92 --> 00:46:18.64 You know she went back in the other the other key little thing that we talked about was I I said it's okay
00:46:18.92 --> 00:46:20.92 For you as the leader to say hey look I made a mistake
00:46:21.64 --> 00:46:26.28 You know what I'm not kicking him out of the school. You know why because this other kid acted like a jerk this other kid
00:46:26.28 --> 00:46:32.68 harassed him this other kid did these other kid things and this child has been a well behaved child and he lost his temper
00:46:32.68 --> 00:46:36.44 And that's human and we're gonna keep men in the school and she did that so
00:46:37.88 --> 00:46:41.40 My point is it's a hard job yeah, and
00:46:42.84 --> 00:46:51.16 Yeah, that's my point big time man and that's and that's another yet another thing that I think we got a balance this in regular
00:46:51.16 --> 00:46:54.92 Society too, but it's so this kid right for example
00:46:54.92 --> 00:46:57.000 You're example where the kid punched the guy
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.64 So boom we have this incident so what do you do though, right? It's like that's a problem if you in as far as
00:47:03.64 --> 00:47:09.000 Problem solving goes you don't punish the kid you evaluate what happened and then you essentially
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000 Help the kid so he doesn't punch in right like some people there like hey we got to punish this kid somehow
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.28 I'll give him detention or something and does that solve the problem?
00:47:16.28 --> 00:47:21.24 Maybe yeah, maybe we actually teach someone to control their emotions exactly right like why do you punch him?
00:47:21.24 --> 00:47:23.64 Oh, okay, there's another problem by the way
00:47:23.64 --> 00:47:30.28 So we got to teach this kid to stop messing around in that way, you know, and then we got to teach this kid
00:47:30.28 --> 00:47:35.64 Okay, if you get you get mess around you right and sometimes the only way some kids learn a lesson is by being
00:47:35.88 --> 00:47:39.96 Severely punished kicked out of a school whatever, you know expelled or something like that
00:47:39.96 --> 00:47:45.16 But most cases what most cases was that really teach them that that that school doesn't care about them right?
00:47:45.56 --> 00:47:48.20 So that's a tough situation, you know interestingly
00:47:49.24 --> 00:47:52.28 In where the warrior kid the next book that's coming out
00:47:52.28 --> 00:47:54.28 Sure the whole
00:47:55.40 --> 00:47:57.88 And I'm not gonna give the whole story way, but the
00:47:58.84 --> 00:48:00.84 the opening chapter
00:48:01.24 --> 00:48:06.20 Young Mark is in the principles office and he's in the principles office
00:48:06.84 --> 00:48:11.000 Because he threw a paper mache pumpkin at another kid's head
00:48:12.20 --> 00:48:17.64 Why did he do it because he was frustrated because he got mad because the kid was picking on him continually
00:48:17.64 --> 00:48:26.68 Verbalizing verbal abuse and finally Mark just got mad and he hucked a paper mache pumpkin at the kid's head
00:48:26.68 --> 00:48:32.28 It bounced off the kid's head and hit and hit miscarpenter right the face to
00:48:32.76 --> 00:48:37.56 So he got sent to the office, but anyways, but the point is where I what the reason I did that is because
00:48:37.72 --> 00:48:41.48 Kids that are eleven years old, they still lose their temper. They haven't learned to control their temper yet
00:48:41.48 --> 00:48:47.000 And so one of the themes in the new warrior kid book is that a warrior has to learn to control their temper
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.20 and control their emotions
00:48:48.20 --> 00:48:50.20 The lessons that we're talking about right now
00:48:50.92 --> 00:48:52.92 Interestingly enough
00:48:52.92 --> 00:48:58.20 So thanks to the teachers out there big ten man because man as the T.E.K. and I have never been a teacher
00:48:58.76 --> 00:49:04.28 Honestly, but I mean just even halfway imagining it man you kind of care about like these kids
00:49:04.28 --> 00:49:08.04 But you care about them all so and then you have all the the whole spectrum of them
00:49:08.04 --> 00:49:10.04 Yeah, the kid who's like
00:49:10.04 --> 00:49:12.52 The teacher is bad is probably the other kids are concerned
00:49:12.52 --> 00:49:17.08 But meanwhile you love that kid because man he's picking up what you're putting down and he's listening
00:49:17.08 --> 00:49:18.68 He's giving you apples and whatnot
00:49:18.68 --> 00:49:22.76 Then you have on the other side you have the one that won't listen anything disrupting your class
00:49:23.32 --> 00:49:27.80 But you want that kid like of course you want to leave you like stop messing up my whole thing
00:49:27.80 --> 00:49:29.08 But you're really successful
00:49:29.08 --> 00:49:32.92 Yeah, man because like when you know how you teach someone something and you see a music
00:49:32.92 --> 00:49:35.32 Oh man, that's the best as any kind of you
00:49:35.72 --> 00:49:39.40 Capacity that you know as far as the role that you play like and you do so or something like that
00:49:40.04 --> 00:49:42.04 Even like another adult
00:49:42.04 --> 00:49:44.04 Because they're all the same right actually I think kids
00:49:44.52 --> 00:49:49.32 Well, there's a fundamental human character as a guy believe that makes you want to help other people
00:49:49.64 --> 00:49:50.52 Yeah
00:49:50.52 --> 00:49:54.36 It feels like you're supposed to influence like living on or something like that
00:49:54.36 --> 00:49:56.36 No, but man so it's like
00:49:56.76 --> 00:50:03.000 It's like yet that's yet another thing you got to deal with as a teacher you know because you're committed man
00:50:03.56 --> 00:50:05.56 It's like
00:50:05.56 --> 00:50:06.84 Tell
00:50:06.84 --> 00:50:15.48 Anyway next question. I'm a firefighter speaking a winch. I'm a firefighter in Australia and in the time
00:50:15.48 --> 00:50:18.20 I've been in this job. I've been in several jobs
00:50:19.64 --> 00:50:25.24 That were very challenging. I've entered burning homes to extinguish fires and search for residents and their pets
00:50:25.24 --> 00:50:31.000 I'd search for victims during times of flood and help people evacuate their homes in times of natural disasters
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.68 I've attended car crashes and cut victims from vehicles and pulled deceased people from others. I've also know that I'm not alone
00:50:39.16 --> 00:50:42.36 I am aware of the fact that while I've been doing this
00:50:42.92 --> 00:50:51.96 Countless firefighters were on the globe were thousands of times braver than me and have done things that the vast majority of the population would not be capable of
00:50:51.96 --> 00:51:02.92 And that doesn't even acknowledge the courage of our police and paramedics and an military who step up day after day to do what has to be done because of if not me and who
00:51:03.48 --> 00:51:08.84 My question is this how do you suggest those and the front line do with the trivial issues at home?
00:51:09.16 --> 00:51:15.56 I attended a very severe car accident. I head on collision with a school bus full of children and another car. Thank for
00:51:15.72 --> 00:51:17.72 Thankfully all the children in the school bus
00:51:17.72 --> 00:51:24.20 Bro, okay, but it took us three hours to cut the driver from the car and she had very serious injuries and it was airlifted to a hospital
00:51:24.44 --> 00:51:28.60 When I got home that night I was confronted by an upset girlfriend
00:51:29.16 --> 00:51:33.08 Want to talk about some extra ordinarily trivial
00:51:33.88 --> 00:51:35.16 issue
00:51:35.16 --> 00:51:39.48 Which I struggled to listen to the whole time she was talking I just kept thinking about the job
00:51:40.12 --> 00:51:45.40 And making sure I I'd done everything I possibly could have for the driver but I was also
00:51:45.40 --> 00:51:49.96 Aware of the fact that my fiance's problems are important to her
00:51:50.44 --> 00:51:52.44 So I need to be supportive
00:51:52.44 --> 00:51:59.56 I listen for as long as I could I listen for as long as I could then unfortunately I just said your day could have been a lot worse
00:51:59.72 --> 00:52:03.000 No one spent three hours cutting you out of a car so be thankful
00:52:03.32 --> 00:52:08.68 I know I can't be alone on this. I know police paramedics in the military would be suffering the same thing
00:52:08.68 --> 00:52:12.12 How do you suggest is the best way to deal with this?
00:52:12.12 --> 00:52:14.12 Check
00:52:16.76 --> 00:52:18.76 So
00:52:19.24 --> 00:52:21.24 it was
00:52:21.64 --> 00:52:24.84 Always always my goal
00:52:25.88 --> 00:52:26.84 to
00:52:26.84 --> 00:52:28.84 Protect my family
00:52:29.80 --> 00:52:31.16 From
00:52:31.16 --> 00:52:35.96 Darkness and evil in the world that includes
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.88 These kind of things you want to shield them from this now. This doesn't mean to keep them
00:52:41.88 --> 00:52:43.88 Oblivious
00:52:43.80 --> 00:52:47.96 You don't want them thinking that the the world that you've created for them
00:52:48.36 --> 00:52:52.76 That's well protected and secure. You don't want them thinking that that's the way the whole world is
00:52:53.32 --> 00:52:55.08 You don't want them thinking that but I sure didn't
00:52:55.80 --> 00:53:03.16 Throw this kind of stuff at my family on a regular basis, but I took pride and I think that that's the answer here
00:53:03.24 --> 00:53:04.84 Take pride in
00:53:04.84 --> 00:53:10.36 letting your family or your loved ones live in worlds where they're
00:53:10.36 --> 00:53:12.36 Travilion issues
00:53:13.32 --> 00:53:18.68 Are the most important thing in their world the most impactful thing in the world for them?
00:53:20.52 --> 00:53:26.20 Okay, so that's that's number one and if you get yourself a little bit of of satisfaction
00:53:26.76 --> 00:53:30.20 Every time you're your significant other
00:53:30.76 --> 00:53:32.76 Complaints that
00:53:32.76 --> 00:53:37.24 You know the ice machine isn't really working up to full speed. It's really horrible
00:53:37.24 --> 00:53:44.28 Right you should be proud think yourself. Yeah. Well, you know what let me let me take a look at it
00:53:44.84 --> 00:53:48.84 There's a kink in the water line. I don't know, but we'll try and get that thing up to speed
00:53:49.40 --> 00:53:51.40 So you can have cold drinks
00:53:51.40 --> 00:53:55.24 Because that's where I want your world to be right. I want you to have plenty of ice
00:53:55.96 --> 00:53:57.96 So for your drinks or whatever
00:53:58.52 --> 00:54:03.08 So that's that's it if you can give you can put your your family in that kind of a
00:54:03.08 --> 00:54:09.24 Protective environment you should be proud of it and you should be and the way they indicate that to you
00:54:09.56 --> 00:54:13.56 They don't say hey, thank you for letting me live in a protected environment. They don't say that to you
00:54:14.12 --> 00:54:16.12 They're in the environment. They don't even know that they're in it
00:54:16.52 --> 00:54:21.40 The way they the way they let you know that they're in that environment is when they when they complain about trivial things
00:54:22.92 --> 00:54:26.20 So that's number one the other thing is try and try and
00:54:27.24 --> 00:54:29.24 See things from other people's perspectives
00:54:29.24 --> 00:54:35.24 You know in in this case my my wife's right
00:54:36.04 --> 00:54:38.68 To my my wife would say things is a big deal to her and
00:54:39.48 --> 00:54:46.04 For her it was a big deal and like I just said I wanted it to be a big deal for her and also I'll tell you what
00:54:46.28 --> 00:54:51.72 We're talking about firefighters and military employees, but this goes to other non-uniformed jobs as well
00:54:51.72 --> 00:54:59.88 If if you can leave you work at work because you think some you know every job there's stresses at every job
00:54:59.88 --> 00:55:04.36 And you're out there grinding and you're a trouble with the boss or you're trying to get a project figure it out
00:55:04.36 --> 00:55:10.52 And you've got all this stress coming down on you or you've lost money or you've got a huge deal on the table whatever the case may be
00:55:12.44 --> 00:55:19.96 If you can isolate your family from that as much as you can and I'm not saying to an unhealthy level
00:55:19.96 --> 00:55:25.64 You're just not telling them what's going on, but bear the burden man bear the burden of
00:55:27.08 --> 00:55:30.20 That you that you hold to protect your family
00:55:32.04 --> 00:55:34.52 So yeah, um
00:55:34.68 --> 00:55:42.44 That's what I think that's what I think we we do our best to protect our family and our loved ones from
00:55:43.48 --> 00:55:47.88 The darkness the pressure the stress the evil in the world again
00:55:47.88 --> 00:55:52.44 You don't make them oblivious you don't disconnect from them in order to do that
00:55:52.76 --> 00:55:56.36 But you shield them from it and you bear the burden yourself so that they don't have to bear it
00:55:57.48 --> 00:56:01.96 As much again you don't want your kids growing up to be spoiled you don't want your wife to be
00:56:02.52 --> 00:56:08.76 Saying if I don't get of a lot ofay this morning I will absolutely not even
00:56:09.96 --> 00:56:11.96 Right you don't want to be married to that person
00:56:12.84 --> 00:56:16.12 Yeah, not even I did that pretty good didn't I
00:56:16.12 --> 00:56:18.12 Me
00:56:18.12 --> 00:56:21.48 My middle daughter is like the funniest person ever and she can do all these crazy
00:56:22.04 --> 00:56:25.24 I'm stealing her material right there because she'll do that
00:56:25.64 --> 00:56:30.12 She'll say that is so oh my god, it's not even
00:56:30.76 --> 00:56:36.28 You know, and she's kidding because she knows that there's human beings like that the world that say not even there's nothing at the end of it
00:56:36.84 --> 00:56:39.32 I think that might be something new
00:56:40.28 --> 00:56:45.64 That's not even you know, I've heard I can't even why can't even oh it's the same thing
00:56:45.64 --> 00:56:49.72 Same thing yeah, yeah some updated. Yeah, it's just a different angle on it
00:56:51.08 --> 00:56:55.48 But yeah, hey, thanks for thanks for doing all that hard work man. That's that's awesome
00:56:55.48 --> 00:57:01.16 I know I see fire fighters police officers military people all the time I hear from all the time and
00:57:01.96 --> 00:57:06.84 Yeah, trying shield your families much as you can don't drag them down the down the darkness with you
00:57:07.24 --> 00:57:08.92 Yeah, it seems like a good thing
00:57:08.92 --> 00:57:16.36 Pride in it that's what I was gonna exactly what I was saying it's like take pride in it's like embracing the role as like the captain kind of yeah, you know
00:57:16.36 --> 00:57:18.60 Where it's like yeah, you know
00:57:18.60 --> 00:57:24.04 Wife's mad about you know they put cream in our coffee and she asked for an on fat milk
00:57:24.84 --> 00:57:29.000 That's from psychopathy um and you know whatever and she's pissed and
00:57:29.72 --> 00:57:33.96 Meanwhile, you know you just pulled a lady out for three hours by the way
00:57:33.96 --> 00:57:40.60 Bus and car crash head-on collision so it's you know you embrace the role is like okay, you know boom
00:57:40.60 --> 00:57:47.64 I'm dealing off one second. I'm dealing with straight-up life in death in kids and accidents in tragedy and then one second later
00:57:47.64 --> 00:57:49.64 I'm dealing with essentially nothing
00:57:49.88 --> 00:57:54.20 Right, but it's my wife's feelings. That's what I'm dealing with my wife's feeling
00:57:54.20 --> 00:57:59.000 I'm not dealing with non-fat milk versus cream. I'm not dealing with that. I'm dealing with my wife's feelings
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.12 And that's part of the job too so you can't just be like hey, I'm gonna do my job one second
00:58:04.12 --> 00:58:10.72 I'm gonna do my job really good in the next second. I'm not gonna do it so good you can't do that embrace the role is the guy who gets the job done
00:58:10.92 --> 00:58:12.92 regards how big how small so
00:58:15.16 --> 00:58:20.36 So as a husband this is where I can speak from because I've been a husband for eight years
00:58:21.96 --> 00:58:23.96 Successfully can't I'm currently husband to
00:58:24.44 --> 00:58:27.48 So there'd be you know how like people have lived in
00:58:27.48 --> 00:58:29.48 Check with her
00:58:29.48 --> 00:58:35.08 Please check for me too because I need that info anyway, but just so you know how
00:58:35.72 --> 00:58:39.08 You know people they'll they'll tell you something and then you'll be like wait
00:58:39.08 --> 00:58:45.24 What did you mean by that you're kind of offended like are you like are you kind of digging at me or something like that you know like that
00:58:45.24 --> 00:58:51.56 kind of even though you know kind of they were right like that was a little passive aggressive little comment
00:58:51.56 --> 00:58:58.52 Kind of thing so everyone's on a while when I'd experience that not just say it happens all the time, but if it ever happened
00:58:59.32 --> 00:59:04.36 What I do to kind of combat the anger because bro I'm like I'm the kind of where like if there's like a
00:59:04.36 --> 00:59:09.40 So you're saying past we're aggressive from your wife. Yes, and what you do to combat the anger would be
00:59:10.12 --> 00:59:11.80 Would be I'm trying to move this story
00:59:11.80 --> 00:59:14.28 It's very significant. No it's relevant to this though and important
00:59:14.28 --> 00:59:20.36 I think it helps a totally helps where I embrace the role of they did I don't know for lack of better than they captain, you know
00:59:20.36 --> 00:59:24.04 And brace the role they captain where sure she's passive aggressive whatever you know
00:59:24.04 --> 00:59:28.28 Maybe all over time I'll start to understand more whatever, but but so I am
00:59:30.84 --> 00:59:37.48 In vision myself is Superman and her passive aggressive comments are bullets and they were just bouncing off of me just like bullets
00:59:37.48 --> 00:59:38.84 I'm superman
00:59:38.84 --> 00:59:43.64 Yeah, that's cool. That's cool until the fact that if you don't react and she's gonna escalate
00:59:43.64 --> 00:59:47.96 She wants some kind of reaction out of you. Yeah, so sometimes you have to give them some kind of reaction
00:59:47.96 --> 00:59:52.92 Yeah, otherwise they'll continue to escalate right at two a point where you do react. Yes. Yeah
00:59:53.32 --> 01:00:00.36 So I mean that little while ago. Yeah, no reaction is is not always good right so and I don't know
01:00:00.36 --> 01:00:04.76 You got to say you got to say the bullet hits you and you got to say oh that bullet hurt. Oh
01:00:06.28 --> 01:00:09.80 Yeah, I should be a little more careful with the bullets are flying around that's wow
01:00:10.20 --> 01:00:14.52 I need to be a little bit more you know careful these bullets they can really hurt me right
01:00:14.52 --> 01:00:18.52 Be careful, but see how your your tone and stuff is like there's no anger there
01:00:18.52 --> 01:00:23.80 Yeah, but that so that's what I meant. I meant it's just to combat the anger not the the problem solving thing
01:00:23.80 --> 01:00:31.08 That's the whole other thing as far as I'm concerned like if she's passive aggressive or mad about I don't know because I put the dish away when it was wet
01:00:31.32 --> 01:00:36.92 You know, be very dry. I did it wet. That's not what's by the way, but I'm just saying if it's just that's a whole different thing
01:00:37.48 --> 01:00:39.48 so if I
01:00:39.48 --> 01:00:46.20 Anger wise the bullets bounce off of me boom. I don't get angry then I can start addressing those issues the ones that you're talking about
01:00:46.20 --> 01:00:51.24 But I mean to combat the straight-up anger. Yeah, keep your emotions in Jack. Yeah, it's definitely like her insults
01:00:51.56 --> 01:00:53.56 bouncing off me like superman
01:00:53.56 --> 01:00:55.56 It help sometimes
01:00:56.12 --> 01:00:58.12 Most of the time. All right next question
01:00:59.64 --> 01:01:00.60 Joko
01:01:00.60 --> 01:01:06.84 I'm leading a project that involves a few my team members and about 10 other team members from other functions
01:01:06.84 --> 01:01:11.32 The project has high visibility in the large organization over 10 billion in revenue
01:01:11.88 --> 01:01:14.52 That I work for so the pressure is to execute is high
01:01:15.08 --> 01:01:19.96 We have had some issues with cross-functional team members meeting their deliverables and keeping the
01:01:20.04 --> 01:01:22.04 To keep the project on path
01:01:22.44 --> 01:01:26.92 But we're pushing sometimes dragging everyone along to make things happen recently
01:01:27.48 --> 01:01:33.08 on a formal review with the leadership team the question was asked why is this project behind
01:01:33.08 --> 01:01:38.76 I'm a firm believer in providing protection for your team so my response was there are excuses
01:01:38.84 --> 01:01:40.84 But to be honest, they're just excuses
01:01:40.84 --> 01:01:47.000 So we're doing everything we can to get it back on track trying to take the brunt of the performance miss on my shoulders
01:01:47.80 --> 01:01:54.60 No additional comments were made in that meeting and it ended my boss was on the call and pulled me aside the next day and
01:01:54.76 --> 01:02:00.92 Voice his opinion that I should not hesitate to call out the lack of performance on the other functional team members
01:02:00.92 --> 01:02:07.000 His thought is that doing so does not allow the leadership to coach mentor and or fix the issues correctly
01:02:07.32 --> 01:02:08.92 I understand this logic
01:02:08.92 --> 01:02:15.80 But I don't feel that true leaders point fingers or throw others under the bus your thoughts would be appreciated
01:02:16.84 --> 01:02:18.84 Okay, so first of all
01:02:19.32 --> 01:02:24.44 Your boss has a little bit of a point, but it's but it's also there's some limitations to it number one
01:02:24.44 --> 01:02:31.72 You know our goal as a leader is to build relationships with people accomplish the mission, etc. etc.
01:02:31.72 --> 01:02:33.72 so if
01:02:34.52 --> 01:02:41.56 If we if we start just calling people out in front of a senior leadership on a call well
01:02:41.56 --> 01:02:47.48 Are you forming a good relationship with people the answers no you're actually making them mad and they're saying
01:02:47.88 --> 01:02:50.84 The first thing they're gonna do when you call them out is called call you up
01:02:50.84 --> 01:02:56.12 As soon as the call ends and they're gonna say dude why don't you tell me that why you tell me this in front of the boss?
01:02:56.20 --> 01:02:58.20 So here's the deal
01:02:58.76 --> 01:03:05.32 You should not ever have to throw someone under the bus without plenty of warning right
01:03:05.96 --> 01:03:10.84 Without plenty of them to to know and expect and be prepared with an answer
01:03:10.92 --> 01:03:14.12 That's what you should be doing it's kind of like that escalation of counseling
01:03:14.12 --> 01:03:16.44 Then I talk about like you start off by just saying hey man
01:03:16.44 --> 01:03:20.84 You wait, you know what's up and you go all the way to like okay if you're late again and there's a whole
01:03:21.88 --> 01:03:24.68 Slow escalation or depending on how fast you need to get it done
01:03:24.92 --> 01:03:28.76 But with this one it's the same thing you say hey echo you know you're part of the project
01:03:28.76 --> 01:03:30.36 Wouldn't you need help right now? What's going on?
01:03:30.36 --> 01:03:36.28 You you don't seem up to speed and then it then we escalate to hacko you just missed another you know target date
01:03:36.84 --> 01:03:39.64 This is the second target date you've missed we get we had a problem
01:03:40.44 --> 01:03:44.60 And then it's a echo. Did you not have the sports you need what do you need because this isn't working out
01:03:44.60 --> 01:03:48.68 And then it's look the only way I'm going to be able to do this we got to bring it up to the boss
01:03:48.68 --> 01:03:53.80 I think you need more people and that's another important thing is is you frame it
01:03:54.12 --> 01:03:56.12 You frame it in such a way
01:03:56.28 --> 01:04:00.92 That it's not hurting them, but it's actually helping them. So I might say on the call hey you know
01:04:02.52 --> 01:04:06.28 Alpha team is working really hard, but they need more xy and d to get the job done
01:04:06.36 --> 01:04:10.12 So you know, I think we should give echo and alpha team more xy and d
01:04:10.12 --> 01:04:14.84 Okay, because he missed a date and and I know they're working hard
01:04:15.80 --> 01:04:21.000 Or you say you know, I think we need more people allocated over to alpha team
01:04:21.40 --> 01:04:26.28 I think they've been over task and they could use some support so let's give them some more people or you can even say
01:04:26.28 --> 01:04:28.76 I'm moving to people from my team over to alpha team
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.68 Temporarily to give them some additional capacity over there because their task is more demanding than what I've been assigned
01:04:34.68 --> 01:04:42.28 So all of those things are letting everyone know bringing the problem to the attention of the of the group
01:04:42.84 --> 01:04:48.20 So that now you say actually jocco here's what's going on. I don't need two more people. I need for more people
01:04:49.16 --> 01:04:51.16 Or you know you say okay
01:04:51.16 --> 01:04:55.24 Um, hey, I don't need anyone else if you want to those people the ego gets in the way
01:04:55.24 --> 01:05:00.52 You say I don't need anyone else and we'll say okay, well you missed two time marks you missed two you know dates
01:05:00.52 --> 01:05:06.44 Well, I don't need any more people okay, okay, well, let's see if you can if you can make this next date
01:05:06.44 --> 01:05:09.40 And I guess you don't but if you miss another date, well, then I guess you need more people
01:05:10.12 --> 01:05:15.64 So we we move through it like that. So yeah, you do have to discuss things you can do you can discuss these things
01:05:15.64 --> 01:05:18.44 You can bring them up in a way that they are not offensive
01:05:19.72 --> 01:05:23.72 To two people they don't throw them under the bus, but they do however
01:05:25.24 --> 01:05:27.64 signify that the bus is around
01:05:27.64 --> 01:05:33.16 And that if we aren't careful you might get hit by the bus and you got to give people plenty of warning
01:05:33.16 --> 01:05:36.28 It's the same thing with same thing. I've talked about in the past with skipping the chain of command
01:05:36.28 --> 01:05:44.12 You know you shouldn't be skipping the chain of command unless unless you've given so much warning and you do it in such a way that
01:05:44.84 --> 01:05:49.16 You know they actually know it's gonna happen they expect us gonna happen they kind of agree with you
01:05:50.12 --> 01:05:53.88 So be careful with those things again if someone's doing something immorally legal
01:05:53.88 --> 01:05:57.88 Unathocally and you skip the chain of command because you've already tried to solve with them and they're not doing it
01:05:57.88 --> 01:05:59.88 Well, then you might have to just go get some
01:06:00.92 --> 01:06:02.92 Because if you're your cobalt if you don't
01:06:04.12 --> 01:06:08.20 So form good relationships with people don't form antagonistic relationships
01:06:08.20 --> 01:06:16.36 You know, I just had to conversation with a guy when I was in in Boston similar situation, but you know you he was saying he there was a situation he was in
01:06:18.20 --> 01:06:19.40 and
01:06:19.40 --> 01:06:21.40 What he said was politically
01:06:21.40 --> 01:06:27.56 It was he didn't want to address it because politically if he dressed it might explode and I said well if it if the if it
01:06:27.56 --> 01:06:32.92 If you address the situation. Oh, it's like a classic case. I know how to do this more efficiently
01:06:33.32 --> 01:06:36.52 This experienced person doesn't want to try my method
01:06:37.56 --> 01:06:40.20 Okay, and I said well, why don't you present him with the method and say
01:06:40.84 --> 01:06:48.20 You know, hey, here's how we should do this and he says no I don't want to do that because the person that I want to get to use the new method is
01:06:48.20 --> 01:06:52.76 Is really close friends with the boss and if you find form that bad relationship
01:06:52.76 --> 01:06:57.80 And it's gonna be bad and I go with that effect you're overall mission to be your ability to do the mission to have bad relationships
01:06:58.12 --> 01:07:03.80 Not only with your immediate boss both with your boss's boss and he's like yes, it would and I go then doesn't sound like a good plan
01:07:04.52 --> 01:07:09.40 There you go. There's your answer because even though you have a better method and you might say like a direct
01:07:09.80 --> 01:07:15.32 A person with a direct train of thought mindset which say no you go you tell the boss's boss
01:07:15.32 --> 01:07:18.28 That this is the method and we're gonna be more efficient if we do it this way
01:07:18.28 --> 01:07:21.96 Well now you've just exploded a bomb on yourself and it's gonna be bad
01:07:22.04 --> 01:07:26.04 So I gave him the classic hey why don't you say listen?
01:07:26.04 --> 01:07:27.88 I think I thought of a new method
01:07:27.88 --> 01:07:34.92 I think we might be able to get some efficiencies out of it but since I'm not as experienced and don't know the systems as well as you do
01:07:34.92 --> 01:07:38.04 I would love to get your feedback on how it works
01:07:38.04 --> 01:07:43.72 I think that you're the only one that could really not do this concierge so experienced and smart and brilliant
01:07:43.72 --> 01:07:50.04 All that stuff and awesome and you try and feed him some of the new methods so that he can try it and
01:07:50.04 --> 01:07:56.20 either say yeah, the stuff's pretty good or you know what there's some things that you didn't realize young buck
01:07:56.52 --> 01:07:58.52 And we gotta get him fixed
01:07:58.76 --> 01:08:00.76 So check
01:08:01.88 --> 01:08:03.88 Try and form relationships
01:08:03.88 --> 01:08:08.04 Positive relationships not antagonistic relationships if you throw people under the bus
01:08:08.84 --> 01:08:11.40 You're not forming good relationships check
01:08:11.40 --> 01:08:17.32 Especially that surprise one. That's rough. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah next question
01:08:19.40 --> 01:08:21.40 To give you a little backstory
01:08:21.40 --> 01:08:25.96 I tried my first jujitsu class last week and during the rolling part of the class
01:08:26.52 --> 01:08:31.16 Happened to get matched up with another white belt who has been going to the gym for over a year
01:08:31.72 --> 01:08:37.88 During the roll I got thrashed around a bit and tapped to what I've been told was called a cross-collar chook
01:08:37.88 --> 01:08:41.32 I ended up getting ghee burns on my neck and my face
01:08:42.68 --> 01:08:47.08 The game right there as well as getting my lip split get
01:08:48.36 --> 01:08:54.52 Having trained moly tie and spared for a couple of years. I'm used to physical pain and that's and that didn't exactly bother me
01:08:54.60 --> 01:09:00.04 What did bother me was marks that that were left on my face which in addition to just not looking good
01:09:00.04 --> 01:09:06.12 I can't have because my job requires that I meet with clients face to face in these clients might make judgments in a sumo
01:09:06.12 --> 01:09:11.88 And a street fight. I also think the white belt I was rolling with went a little too hard on me
01:09:12.44 --> 01:09:16.84 But I don't know enough about jujitsu to determine whether or not people go full speed every roll
01:09:17.56 --> 01:09:23.72 I know that in moly tie box in boxing normally we try to tone down the intensity level for newbies
01:09:23.80 --> 01:09:26.84 Especially the first time they spar so my questions are
01:09:27.64 --> 01:09:31.64 One does jujitsu normally leave you with lots of marks or scrapes on your face
01:09:31.64 --> 01:09:36.68 I don't mind occasionally getting them but can't go home with them after every class
01:09:37.88 --> 01:09:46.92 Or first question second question do people normally go full speed in rolling and if not how do I get him to stop without sounding like a giant wimp?
01:09:47.96 --> 01:09:54.12 Okay, so number one does BJJ normally leave you with lots of marks to scrapes on your face the answer is no
01:09:54.44 --> 01:09:56.92 Not normally will you occasionally?
01:09:56.92 --> 01:10:03.000 Yes, you will actually you will get dinged up you'll get black eyes you'll split your left you'll have ghee barons on your face
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.04 Yeah, it's scratch yeah that'll that's gonna happen
01:10:06.52 --> 01:10:12.92 It's but it's not regular. Yeah, it's not regular. It's what do you think once every three weeks on your face
01:10:13.64 --> 01:10:17.000 And neck yeah once every three weeks once every three weeks
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.76 We have ones. Maybe once a month you have something visible while you're wearing a suit presenting to clients
01:10:22.76 --> 01:10:30.32 Given the normal amount of training you know like train your train wants to trade up competitive, you know
01:10:30.76 --> 01:10:36.52 Mode two times a day okay, well then it does more of course, but yeah, it's more but normal training yeah
01:10:37.40 --> 01:10:45.96 And then the next question is do people normally go full speed in rolling and if not how do I get him to stop without sounding like a giant wimp?
01:10:46.20 --> 01:10:48.20 So this is actually funny
01:10:48.20 --> 01:10:56.36 Because if you think about it think about this he's kind of complaining in a way that the other person was going too hard
01:10:56.68 --> 01:10:58.92 right? Yes, and yet
01:10:59.48 --> 01:11:01.48 He didn't tap
01:11:02.36 --> 01:11:07.000 To this until his face was scraped and got thrashed around so what I'm saying is
01:11:07.72 --> 01:11:12.12 It takes two people to escalate a situation and without knowing it
01:11:12.44 --> 01:11:17.80 He escalated the situation because he resisted his heart as he could he's only been training for a day and he's going with it
01:11:17.80 --> 01:11:22.28 You're fighting like crazy instead of just relaxing and being like hey, you know, I've only been I've never trained before
01:11:22.28 --> 01:11:26.68 Oh, you're gonna choke me out cool. Yeah, you know instead of learning and relaxing
01:11:27.88 --> 01:11:31.48 You you allow yourself to get caught up in the
01:11:32.12 --> 01:11:34.92 primal instinct of fighting for your life
01:11:34.92 --> 01:11:40.68 What happened when people started you did through they the primal instinct takes over and it's also
01:11:41.08 --> 01:11:46.98 ego and and the will to win it takes over and they just want to go so hard and they can't believe that this little guys
01:11:46.98 --> 01:11:50.50 Joke me the knock on let it happen so that is actually your ego and
01:11:51.46 --> 01:11:53.70 And it's also your ego and
01:11:54.02 --> 01:11:59.90 I tell people all time one of the main reasons people get hurt in jiu-jitsu is because of ego you either don't tap number one
01:12:00.02 --> 01:12:02.02 Which is just stupid or
01:12:02.90 --> 01:12:07.78 You you don't say no to rolling with people that you know you shouldn't roll with
01:12:08.58 --> 01:12:12.30 That's it and when I say don't tap it's like has to do with with
01:12:12.30 --> 01:12:17.66 The way you're rolling to right I mean if you're just gonna fight everything so super hard
01:12:18.22 --> 01:12:23.02 Because you want to win well then you're gonna end up having a much higher chance of getting injured
01:12:23.58 --> 01:12:24.86 So I
01:12:24.86 --> 01:12:30.58 Fall into that sometimes too you know if I'm it like I had a hurt knee the other day and you know
01:12:30.58 --> 01:12:33.50 Maybe like a month ago my knee was a little hurt and
01:12:34.38 --> 01:12:40.14 I was rolling but I hadn't been doing a lot of stand-up and all of a sudden I was escalating with whoever would like
01:12:40.14 --> 01:12:45.98 And be or someone and all of a sudden I was standing and I didn't want to give up the
01:12:46.50 --> 01:12:50.38 Position right and as I'm standing there. I'm like oh, this is your ego right now
01:12:50.38 --> 01:12:56.22 You you you have no reason to sit here and fight on the feet where your where your knee is actually bothering you
01:12:56.62 --> 01:12:59.66 Just don't be an idiot and just
01:12:59.66 --> 01:13:03.34 Spole guard and and so no big deal right okay, pull guard
01:13:03.90 --> 01:13:07.82 Whatever did you pull guard? I did yeah because I was realized I was being stupid
01:13:07.82 --> 01:13:13.18 And if I'm there I am I've been healing and I'm almost good to go and now I'm gonna jeopardize it because I just
01:13:13.18 --> 01:13:17.42 I want to stand up and get some right stupid stupid
01:13:17.90 --> 01:13:19.10 So
01:13:19.10 --> 01:13:22.46 That is what you have to do you have to put your ego in check and that is a huge part of the digits
01:13:22.46 --> 01:13:27.34 That's one of the things that makes you get so impactful. It's so humbling your ego can't withstand it
01:13:27.34 --> 01:13:32.46 And despite how hard you fought against this guy in this question that guy was still gonna tap you
01:13:32.46 --> 01:13:35.10 Oh, you didn't stand a chance you didn't stand a chance
01:13:35.10 --> 01:13:40.14 Yeah, my first class versus the guy who'd been rolling for over a year. Yeah, you don't stand a chance
01:13:40.14 --> 01:13:45.98 You don't stand a chance. You don't so what what you want to do is you want to learn
01:13:46.70 --> 01:13:49.10 So put your ego aside relax
01:13:50.22 --> 01:13:53.26 Talk and if you get good someone that's going so you don't want to sound like a whim
01:13:53.90 --> 01:14:00.46 That's what gets you hurt what's cool is when somebody's 58 years old and they're on the mat and some
01:14:00.46 --> 01:14:09.10 Some 22 year old blue belt that weighs 80 pounds more than them says who you want to roll and the older dude says
01:14:09.26 --> 01:14:14.70 No man, I'm good. I'm not rolling with you because their ego is in check and they realize that's not gonna get him anywhere
01:14:14.70 --> 01:14:18.46 Yeah, rolling with this big idiot. Yeah, that's not gonna get him anywhere
01:14:18.46 --> 01:14:22.30 So they're saying no, I don't want all of you their ego is fine. They get their over it
01:14:22.70 --> 01:14:30.06 So put your ego in check you won't get marked up a lot and people people will go full speed if you're going full speed
01:14:30.06 --> 01:14:34.46 That's the answer. Yeah, the harder you go the harder the other person's going
01:14:34.46 --> 01:14:38.94 You want to go in there and get to a level seven death match with every person you roll with you're gonna get them
01:14:39.34 --> 01:14:43.16 You're gonna get them especially with people that are around your level yeah
01:14:43.50 --> 01:14:46.62 Because if the person's a purple belt or a brown belt or a black belt
01:14:46.70 --> 01:14:48.94 You can go nuts on them. It doesn't even matter to them
01:14:48.94 --> 01:14:55.14 They're just gonna be laughing at you. Oh, though you can you can offend them and I see some black belts and some good
01:14:55.14 --> 01:15:02.58 Judic you just you practitioners that get offended if someone attacks them with fury like they have a chance
01:15:03.14 --> 01:15:07.86 And you go okay cool you want to be like that. I'm gonna smash you and I've done that from time to time
01:15:07.86 --> 01:15:12.42 You know where someone just they're in there. They're like they think it's their day or whatever
01:15:12.42 --> 01:15:18.06 And they think they're gonna get you and you go oh you're not gonna get me, but now you've now you're gonna get God
01:15:18.06 --> 01:15:20.06 Yeah, it's not gonna be fun
01:15:20.38 --> 01:15:22.38 Yeah, that tends to happen though
01:15:22.38 --> 01:15:28.14 Not if you're well within the confines of just you just this stuff like um, but if you start to
01:15:28.46 --> 01:15:32.90 Drift towards the edges of etiquette so like let's say like if I'm if you know
01:15:32.90 --> 01:15:36.18 I'm gonna spar with you and today is my day and I start
01:15:36.78 --> 01:15:40.46 stiff-arming you hard and doing that kind of stuff stuff that's it's legal
01:15:40.46 --> 01:15:42.46 But it's like yeah for sure you shouldn't you know
01:15:42.46 --> 01:15:46.12 It's like that kind of stuff that'll make a hair belt mad. I think what you are
01:15:46.12 --> 01:15:53.60 You're correct just someone going just someone going level nine psycho instead of just being oh you want to roll
01:15:53.60 --> 01:15:57.52 Hey cool you hey we we're gonna use strength. I get that I get that we're gonna use strength
01:15:57.52 --> 01:16:01.44 That's the way it works that's part of the game. That's why we work out right? I get that we're gonna go fast
01:16:01.44 --> 01:16:05.08 I get that that's cool, but you want to just go level nine psycho cool
01:16:05.32 --> 01:16:09.76 That's it's not gonna work out good. Yeah, and just crews man have a good time
01:16:09.92 --> 01:16:13.72 Yeah, nothing wrong with that. I'm a huge advocate of cruising for sure
01:16:13.72 --> 01:16:19.44 But I'm I support like guys going hard for sure
01:16:19.44 --> 01:16:22.24 Even like young guys. I mean like with with this guy
01:16:22.64 --> 01:16:27.80 But but the thing is this guy is saying how does he stop it? Yeah, the way you stop it is by relaxing
01:16:28.08 --> 01:16:31.92 Yeah, I'm full support of people going hard. Yeah, you know, and I go hard
01:16:32.40 --> 01:16:36.92 Right I go I guess you're right. Yeah. I mean I train hard for sure
01:16:37.16 --> 01:16:42.10 But like if I don't know you yeah, and you want to just go level nine
01:16:42.10 --> 01:16:50.02 Well, we'll go level nine, but you know, yeah, it's all it's all the spectrum of judy to and also
01:16:50.02 --> 01:16:56.06 I get it though like you know he doesn't want marks all over his face all the time for I mean to me
01:16:56.06 --> 01:17:01.06 You don't even have to say because of work you just say I don't want marks all over my neck on my face all the time
01:17:01.06 --> 01:17:02.94 You know that's why because that's actually what I do
01:17:04.22 --> 01:17:06.78 It's cool, but you know how like okay
01:17:06.78 --> 01:17:10.74 So I don't wear mouthpiece anymore so every once in a great while like I'll bite my tongue
01:17:10.74 --> 01:17:16.16 That's and then you can't eat for a few days not that good. Yeah, it's or you ever get your job
01:17:18.50 --> 01:17:22.24 You can't eat you know it's herdsie catch yes next question
01:17:22.24 --> 01:17:24.54 Allered with Italian dressing really stinks
01:17:24.54 --> 01:17:27.34 Yeah, that's where you're right. You're right. You're right eat for a couple. That's exactly
01:17:27.34 --> 01:17:33.44 But or if you get like a jaw like this is what I'll get coming one you'll get your jaw whacked like
01:17:33.44 --> 01:17:38.10 Right here something opposite down a side for a little bit. Yeah, so you can't bite down on that
01:17:38.10 --> 01:17:40.78 Yeah, so you kind of can't eat for like a week
01:17:42.06 --> 01:17:44.38 You gotta drink through a straw like
01:17:45.02 --> 01:17:52.06 Anyway, but so yeah, I get it, but just like how you said man. It's that ego and I'm in support of ego
01:17:52.06 --> 01:17:55.90 It's kind of what gives you jiu jitsu and doing jiu jitsu. It's bluster
01:17:55.90 --> 01:17:59.74 Really the guy like guy going like what if I roll with you and I tap you up
01:17:59.74 --> 01:18:02.30 But you were not going hard at all. I don't want to do that
01:18:02.30 --> 01:18:06.18 I'd rather get tapped out by you every single time than tap you on when you weren't going hard
01:18:06.18 --> 01:18:14.44 As far as like my jiu jitsu. Yeah journey kind of thing. Yeah, but but at the same time like bro
01:18:14.44 --> 01:18:18.84 If you don't want that beef if you don't want to go with some big guy going hard
01:18:18.84 --> 01:18:24.52 Brad just say sorry bro. I mean no district the Minggan sirn is not disrespecting the guy like you know
01:18:24.52 --> 01:18:31.82 How you I've asked people a roll and I know I may be a little bit more bigger whatever than like the average guy right
01:18:31.82 --> 01:18:37.54 So I'll ask something to roll and they they won't even answer they'll just look away straight up look away
01:18:37.54 --> 01:18:43.98 And I'm like okay, I really got it kind of understand. Okay, maybe they just don't want that beef and they don't know how to say it to me
01:18:44.26 --> 01:18:46.94 Respectfully, you know, I've never had anyone like look away
01:18:46.94 --> 01:18:50.78 That's weird. Yeah, I had a time to ask them. I okay
01:18:50.78 --> 01:18:56.46 I asked a guy to roll and he acted like he didn't hear me and looked away
01:18:56.46 --> 01:19:03.10 I went to the next guy of standing up to maybe that kind of helped didn't help my situation but whatever
01:19:03.90 --> 01:19:05.90 I asked the guy right next to him
01:19:06.30 --> 01:19:11.34 Same exact thing he acted like oh he was kind of in a conversation and then all I mean
01:19:11.34 --> 01:19:14.82 I got a little bit frustrated. I said so no one wants no one's rolling here
01:19:14.82 --> 01:19:18.94 That's what I said so that's what we're doing everyone's saying that in no one's real and then like someone rolled into me
01:19:18.94 --> 01:19:20.78 I think whatever is little while we'll
01:19:20.78 --> 01:19:22.22 But the intimidate
01:19:22.22 --> 01:19:27.90 No, but here's the thing here's the thing of course at the time it's a little bit frustrating and this is kind of part of the point where
01:19:28.86 --> 01:19:31.34 If they didn't want to roll because maybe whatever
01:19:31.34 --> 01:19:36.62 It was too big and they were like small or something like that then you can tell the guy hey
01:19:36.62 --> 01:19:39.90 Look respectfully like I don't want to roll with you
01:19:39.90 --> 01:19:42.78 I fear injury I fear whatever if you're marks on my face or whatever
01:19:42.94 --> 01:19:46.86 Right no problem. I dig it and I understand even if there's no one else
01:19:46.86 --> 01:19:52.62 Or you're saying have the respect to tell you the truth that's the thing because you're you're gonna need to the little pump of like
01:19:52.62 --> 01:19:54.62 They're scared of you
01:19:54.62 --> 01:19:56.62 Wouldn't that be the opposite the
01:19:57.02 --> 01:19:57.98 Nonetheless
01:19:57.98 --> 01:19:59.82 Yeah, that's that's the thing though
01:20:00.30 --> 01:20:06.46 Like you that's what you have to in my opinion you have to address it like and the other thing the other thing about this not because I may have
01:20:07.10 --> 01:20:10.62 the that being said like if someone wants roll with you
01:20:11.74 --> 01:20:15.10 If you're healthy human being man getting all that's what I was saying
01:20:15.10 --> 01:20:21.10 That's what I was saying and what when that I get it if you have a situation and this is one that I need to
01:20:21.10 --> 01:20:24.46 I always have to watch out for like if I haven't let's say I'm injured and
01:20:25.26 --> 01:20:31.10 Let's say I normally do 10 rounds nine rounds eight rounds like that's my normal training
01:20:31.82 --> 01:20:33.58 And when I'm injured
01:20:33.58 --> 01:20:34.62 I'll be like okay
01:20:34.62 --> 01:20:36.78 I'm only gonna do like four rounds
01:20:36.78 --> 01:20:42.14 I'm gonna do five rounds, but then someone's like let's get one more. Yeah, and that's what the hardest thing for me is to say
01:20:42.14 --> 01:20:49.50 No because my instinct all the time is like oh, so once roll, let's do it. Let's do it. Yes get it on you want to with me. Let's get it on
01:20:50.30 --> 01:20:52.30 Yeah, and so and I
01:20:53.10 --> 01:20:57.18 Yeah again this is all part of it and two and this is a total opinion or
01:20:57.82 --> 01:21:02.62 Floss fear whatever, but yeah, that's how it should be that's what I think do that's how it should be
01:21:03.18 --> 01:21:05.42 Like if I ask you to roll and you're just sitting there
01:21:05.82 --> 01:21:11.90 During the rolling part of training and you're just sitting there essentially waiting for someone to ask you to roll really
01:21:11.90 --> 01:21:13.90 That's what it is, you know and
01:21:14.62 --> 01:21:19.90 You'd like turn your head then why are you here like you're only gonna roll with you as me to roll and I was like
01:21:19.90 --> 01:21:23.26 Hey man, I got a tweaked knee. I can't roll anymore today, man. No, you're getting with that. I
01:21:23.66 --> 01:21:25.30 100% you go home and like I
01:21:26.30 --> 01:21:29.66 You know that's what I would do 100% but yes, no
01:21:29.98 --> 01:21:35.66 I'm talking about being selective with who you roll like I won't roll with him because he'll tap me out
01:21:35.66 --> 01:21:37.50 I won't roll with him because that's he goes
01:21:37.50 --> 01:21:40.22 He goes hard and I'll get tired. I don't know what I'm asking you
01:21:40.22 --> 01:21:45.34 It's tough as people yeah, okay, and again that's like your philosophy and I agree with that
01:21:45.74 --> 01:21:51.26 But if you're like being selective like that guys too big and advanced he might mess me up
01:21:51.34 --> 01:21:55.58 Look if you're if you're concerned about actual injury, that's one thing
01:21:56.22 --> 01:22:02.06 But if you're like the like the basic of the situation that I explain those in and this is what this is what I think
01:22:02.06 --> 01:22:05.82 Give in all the all the information. I kind of gathered from the situation
01:22:06.22 --> 01:22:08.22 They didn't want to roll with me because
01:22:08.22 --> 01:22:12.62 I was maybe I don't know bigger intimidating were you higher belts than them? Yes
01:22:13.50 --> 01:22:17.10 That's really weird then no, but see and that's what I thought to us like well
01:22:17.10 --> 01:22:21.50 Maybe that's honestly if you're a lower belt if you're a lower belt and you're smaller
01:22:21.82 --> 01:22:25.26 You have absolutely nothing no shame in getting tapped out by a
01:22:25.50 --> 01:22:29.34 That dude that's a higher belt than you that's what I was saying out because I was talking to my brother
01:22:29.34 --> 01:22:34.26 And did you do a breath check before you went in there or something maybe you'd be checking maybe you just smelled really bad
01:22:34.26 --> 01:22:38.18 No one wanted to roll with you no, bro because the fact is I did do those checks
01:22:38.18 --> 01:22:43.38 I do them every single time that's why I know but I talked to my brother and great about this
01:22:43.38 --> 01:22:48.90 I was like I was trying to be understanding you know, but at put the first part of the conversation with Greg train
01:22:49.78 --> 01:22:51.62 No, I don't think Greg was there
01:22:51.62 --> 01:22:54.50 Greg train you might you might you might underestimate Greg train
01:22:54.74 --> 01:22:56.90 You might be like I'll just roll with this little guy
01:22:56.90 --> 01:22:58.90 No, you see his ears are like I
01:22:58.90 --> 01:23:03.94 I was talking to them at like the next day or something so I didn't went there, but
01:23:05.14 --> 01:23:09.30 So Greg was saying the same thing is you's like not now you don't do that stuff. Why are you even here that?
01:23:09.86 --> 01:23:11.38 But Jade brought up a good point
01:23:11.70 --> 01:23:15.38 He said well it doesn't matter why you think they should be there
01:23:15.62 --> 01:23:19.38 They're they pay their membership and they're they're they're learned you did too
01:23:19.54 --> 01:23:23.78 They have the right to train with whoever they want and they have the right to not train with whoever they don't want
01:23:23.78 --> 01:23:31.54 Jade Charles with the free will right it's true and that but that that very thing applies to this guy right here casting etiquette out the window
01:23:31.86 --> 01:23:35.54 Jade Charles right yeah, and that's kind of the counter argument which is legitimate
01:23:35.54 --> 01:23:40.90 But there is the etiquette of the mats it's like it's like if you go to a 24-year fitness gym or whatever
01:23:40.90 --> 01:23:46.34 You're the guy you're not I mean now not is they have a science as re-recruates, but you know
01:23:46.34 --> 01:23:50.98 There's certain things that you just you're just gonna do for the etiquette. You know, you know
01:23:50.98 --> 01:23:55.70 Mark Bar yeah of course okay. Mark Bar yeah he's a beast right and he
01:23:56.58 --> 01:23:59.46 fights at one fifty five so we'd walk around at one seventy
01:24:00.18 --> 01:24:06.98 Wrong yeah and not scared just not to you but you know he and I would have wars wars
01:24:07.54 --> 01:24:11.40 Total wars every single time may him and we had a packed
01:24:12.02 --> 01:24:16.02 Always sure is that I will roll if you no matter what no matter what is going on
01:24:16.02 --> 01:24:19.86 I will roll I will roll I will roll if you I know he's always like he'd come in
01:24:19.86 --> 01:24:25.22 For for me it was you know I'd roll in from either work or I'd be done training with a bunch of people and then
01:24:25.22 --> 01:24:29.22 He'd show up or for him it was he'd be done with like a crazy sparring session
01:24:29.62 --> 01:24:34.66 But yeah, so I was I always told him no matter what I'll roll with you because and the reason I told him that
01:24:35.22 --> 01:24:36.90 Is because I didn't want to roll with him
01:24:36.90 --> 01:24:39.38 Yeah, because it was always freaking hardcore
01:24:39.38 --> 01:24:44.58 It was always because he moved all the time and he was so strong and so fast and boony
01:24:45.06 --> 01:24:47.06 And he's submissions are savage and
01:24:47.06 --> 01:24:51.30 He was a guy I was I'd like I didn't want to roll with him
01:24:51.30 --> 01:24:54.58 And that's exactly why I made a packed with my own always roll with that
01:24:55.22 --> 01:25:02.58 You want to be yeah, because it is a it's a siege to roll with it and there's guys like that and you know
01:25:02.58 --> 01:25:05.38 Like you know, it's funny you know Taylor and Andy by the way
01:25:05.38 --> 01:25:11.14 They're like that if you make it like that, but if you don't well you might be different because you're kind of in a different position
01:25:11.14 --> 01:25:13.14 But when you roll with them
01:25:13.14 --> 01:25:18.82 If you start to go light they'll just go light the whole time by the way, but if you turn up the heat and they'll turn out the heat and
01:25:18.82 --> 01:25:21.70 Thank them, but yeah, that's that's a big thing where
01:25:22.26 --> 01:25:28.18 Like some guys man here like okay, I got to get mentally ready to do this, you know because they just bring a lot
01:25:28.18 --> 01:25:33.94 Yeah, and depends on how your game matches up with them. Yeah, you know your game matches differently with different people
01:25:33.94 --> 01:25:35.78 Yeah, that's true to big time
01:25:36.02 --> 01:25:38.02 But yeah, this guy
01:25:38.02 --> 01:25:44.98 You know, does it normally leave you with lots of marks not really I think you're right and but the more
01:25:45.54 --> 01:25:51.22 You know ambitious hungry white belts you roll with with the ghee yeah the more marks and the more
01:25:51.22 --> 01:25:56.02 G and more your ego forces you to fight them as if it's a death match yeah level nine
01:25:57.22 --> 01:25:57.94 Yeah
01:25:57.94 --> 01:26:00.66 Very true and then do people go full speed
01:26:01.86 --> 01:26:04.34 You know what 50 50 maybe well
01:26:04.34 --> 01:26:10.58 I see be no technically no it's awful. Yeah, yeah, yeah, like can you cruise like I always do a warm up
01:26:10.58 --> 01:26:16.66 Rwann warm up round with Andy no one out with Andy and Dean Dean won't do a warm up round with me because that's when he
01:26:16.66 --> 01:26:18.66 You guys meet with full strength
01:26:18.82 --> 01:26:24.34 Deity is awesome and we always do one round just to break a sweat. We're just cruising and then the next round will go
01:26:24.90 --> 01:26:26.90 And when we go I mean we go
01:26:28.10 --> 01:26:32.74 I guess maybe there's some great Asian at the high end of the spectrum and I will
01:26:32.74 --> 01:26:35.86 Recognize a difference between that like let's say for instance
01:26:36.26 --> 01:26:44.42 You say like I'll know I don't want to let Andy pass my guard today right like for referred like a legit reason like I think
01:26:44.42 --> 01:26:48.58 He's got some new offensive move that I see him been pulling off and I go when if he gets this position on me today
01:26:48.58 --> 01:26:50.58 I'm gonna be in a real bad situation
01:26:50.58 --> 01:26:53.86 So he's not passed my guard so then he'll feel like I'm going harder
01:26:54.42 --> 01:26:59.14 Yeah, yeah because a lot of times you you pass my guard okay, cool whatever now you're cross side now
01:26:59.14 --> 01:27:05.14 Trying to escape that what you know what I mean it's it's that's like when you're competing when you're when someone is competing with you in
01:27:05.14 --> 01:27:08.74 Gitu especially with the gui it's so noticeable in a competition
01:27:09.30 --> 01:27:15.86 How hard they grip everything and how you can't get a millimeter of movement that you don't have to fight for
01:27:16.02 --> 01:27:22.10 Yeah, you can't simulate that in you can't simulate that level of intensity on the mats
01:27:22.42 --> 01:27:24.74 Yeah, that only comes in competition yeah
01:27:24.74 --> 01:27:30.26 Yeah, in the church on the training mats, but in a way and I took a talk to Greg about this a lot where it's kind of
01:27:30.82 --> 01:27:35.14 You know how like someone's been super stubborn like what the day I was talking to him
01:27:35.14 --> 01:27:38.98 This is what I was talking about like the guy who you get a sweet bottom or something and they don't
01:27:39.46 --> 01:27:41.38 It's almost like they're not even fighting Gitu anymore
01:27:41.38 --> 01:27:45.78 They just want to get to their feet and stand up because they don't want to play on the bottom right these good
01:27:45.78 --> 01:27:50.66 So I was talking to that him about that and you know that it was kind of frustrating and whatever and he was like
01:27:50.66 --> 01:27:57.94 Hey bro like that's like that's like that's kind of his job. Yeah, I was like give you an accurate representation of somebody giving you
01:27:58.50 --> 01:28:02.98 Trouble in whatever way yeah, he's about to tell that's the same thing with Jay Charles said like if that guy
01:28:02.98 --> 01:28:05.94 If you allow that guy to get your feet then that's bad as matter of fact
01:28:05.94 --> 01:28:07.62 I went through this cycle of Dean where I
01:28:08.18 --> 01:28:13.46 Realized that I wasn't giving Dean a good representation because every time he we had some good
01:28:13.86 --> 01:28:16.66 Guard passes that he would do from a little bit of a distance and
01:28:16.66 --> 01:28:20.74 And and they were working well and then I said well, I don't want it. I just stand up
01:28:20.74 --> 01:28:25.30 Yeah, and so then I just started standing up and then all of a sudden he realized he couldn't give me that much space
01:28:25.30 --> 01:28:29.86 Which messed up that guard pass which put us back to both getting better because we were improving
01:28:30.42 --> 01:28:33.86 The techniques that we were each using so yeah, sometimes
01:28:34.98 --> 01:28:36.34 Now
01:28:36.34 --> 01:28:38.34 Have you ever rolled with someone that you
01:28:38.58 --> 01:28:42.02 They're just not doing they're they're they're just
01:28:42.02 --> 01:28:48.26 They're just they're just not engaging. Yeah, right? So there's not engage yeah, that could be that can be a little bit frustrating
01:28:48.26 --> 01:28:50.26 Yes, and
01:28:50.26 --> 01:28:52.26 Sometimes I do that
01:28:52.26 --> 01:28:54.26 But that's part of an overall strategy
01:28:54.98 --> 01:28:56.98 But yeah, oh yeah 100% like the guy
01:28:57.54 --> 01:29:02.82 Because and again this goes back to why you're doing you just to begin with though so
01:29:03.22 --> 01:29:07.38 Let's say if you're if you're doing it like to to compete in the tournament a guy not engaging
01:29:07.54 --> 01:29:11.06 That's part of your training right there, too. Yeah, that is but if you're like, you know
01:29:11.06 --> 01:29:17.86 If this is the fight and you know if you like all elements and let's say you're focusing on like a self-defense
01:29:18.02 --> 01:29:21.06 Situation and the guy's not engaging then yeah, you might as well be like I
01:29:21.38 --> 01:29:26.26 I might as well train with you. It is good. You're right. It is good because also I've gone with like some wrestlers
01:29:26.74 --> 01:29:30.90 That they know they're let's say they're a purple button G2 and they're doing a five-minute round with you
01:29:31.30 --> 01:29:37.46 And they're just their their goal is to just avoid and knock it taped out and they're not really gonna roll G2 with you
01:29:37.46 --> 01:29:39.30 They're just gonna avoid and knock it taped out
01:29:39.30 --> 01:29:42.74 They're not gonna progress like the only they get the double leg now. They're in your guard
01:29:42.74 --> 01:29:46.66 They're gonna sit there and hold your hips. Yeah, so they're gonna sit there. So for me what I've to do
01:29:46.66 --> 01:29:49.30 I need to have some moves to get some out of the out of your breath
01:29:49.94 --> 01:29:51.94 Gotta take some honor
01:29:52.50 --> 01:29:56.02 Yeah, just like the guy who doesn't like tatsome who's strong and doesn't tap you know
01:29:56.26 --> 01:29:58.74 So either forces you to like injure them or
01:29:59.62 --> 01:30:07.46 Let go kind of thing yeah, that's kind of the same thing where it's it's it's weird dichotomy though because like what do you do know now?
01:30:07.46 --> 01:30:11.94 It's kind of up to you you know the guy who okay, so if it doesn't tap right and you kind of get mad
01:30:11.94 --> 01:30:17.46 I'm like you're gonna force me to injure you you know you have to take that training as
01:30:18.26 --> 01:30:22.18 As this realistic training where this guy is giving you a very accurate look
01:30:22.82 --> 01:30:29.14 Where sure you can choose to injure them now it's on you you chose to injure sure and whatever you chose
01:30:29.14 --> 01:30:34.26 You chose especially if he was giving you less of an option or you just let him go and understand that yeah
01:30:34.26 --> 01:30:39.14 I understand accurately got to be honest with yourself that I would have had that submission. I could have been
01:30:39.46 --> 01:30:41.46 But don't be all mad because
01:30:41.46 --> 01:30:46.82 You know you should have tapped and gave me that win in training, you know like you said don't do that
01:30:46.82 --> 01:30:51.06 You know yeah, you gotta keep your mind wait, but you said who cares come on bro come on
01:30:51.06 --> 01:30:54.90 I said that's your good dog. I know but for how you care though. I care
01:30:56.02 --> 01:31:02.82 What if someone if someone because one time out the reason I was talking to was talking to Greg again about it
01:31:02.82 --> 01:31:08.18 About a guy was wrong with who didn't want to tap and I was mad because he was forcing me to
01:31:08.74 --> 01:31:13.78 Either in Jerome or he wasn't getting give me that that win in training. So what did you do?
01:31:14.50 --> 01:31:16.10 I don't go
01:31:16.10 --> 01:31:18.34 From one time and big it was a light belt
01:31:18.34 --> 01:31:22.66 He started going hard, you know how this is just an alt white belt like what what submission was it?
01:31:22.66 --> 01:31:26.02 I'm talking about another story now. I told him because I mean just I'm just saying like
01:31:26.02 --> 01:31:29.30 You know, he the both okay, so the real story
01:31:29.30 --> 01:31:33.62 That's all can you not tap into a community yeah, he's strong but
01:31:34.02 --> 01:31:36.02 So maybe you didn't really have it
01:31:36.58 --> 01:31:42.18 Bro I had it bro. It's I'm not weak either that's the thing so he's strong and I'm like okay
01:31:42.18 --> 01:31:45.14 It's to hear you steer it's here. It didn't matter
01:31:45.14 --> 01:31:48.82 I knew I knew with certainty where it's like okay
01:31:48.82 --> 01:31:51.14 I'm gonna have to injure the person though
01:31:52.42 --> 01:31:56.02 And you know he didn't tap but Greg made a good point where it's like that's his job
01:31:56.02 --> 01:32:00.58 You know, he's giving you an accurate look of what it's like so at the end of the day sure
01:32:00.58 --> 01:32:06.34 I could have chosen to injure him and then it's partially his fault but the thing is I can't account for whether it's his fault or not
01:32:06.34 --> 01:32:11.38 I'm accounting for what training? I'm getting by the way what training I'm getting not come you know
01:32:11.38 --> 01:32:13.38 It's not a competition it's not a street
01:32:14.02 --> 01:32:18.74 Switching stories. I'll make it quick to it was a white belt. I was wronging with he was going nuts
01:32:19.38 --> 01:32:23.54 And I took it personal back to what we were talking about earlier. You were here at this time purple
01:32:23.54 --> 01:32:29.22 So I was taking a personal I was like, oh, dude, are you trying to go nuts on me like just doing stuff?
01:32:29.22 --> 01:32:32.58 It was all within the confines of etiquette, but he was going a little bit too hard right
01:32:33.86 --> 01:32:38.50 Later I found out that's just his style by the way, which is a total innocent thing but at that time I was like
01:32:38.50 --> 01:32:42.90 I was like oh, okay, you're what go hard. I'm gonna go hard and I injure them. Here's the thing
01:32:43.46 --> 01:32:46.26 I injured them with a submission because I went there
01:32:46.26 --> 01:32:54.90 He more again and not that I did it necessarily so hard that I heard them, but he had a bad shoulder and I did it really
01:32:54.90 --> 01:32:58.18 I think not all it's okay. I had a bad shoulder. I didn't know it. I don't think of it
01:32:58.90 --> 01:33:03.30 I was gonna say I've never injured anyone with a submission but I have injured a couple people
01:33:04.82 --> 01:33:12.02 One of them danger you yeah my rib man. Oh, yeah, but that's just wrong. Yeah, that's just wrong. No, but I'm saying with a submission locked in
01:33:12.02 --> 01:33:19.22 Right, the times I've done it is I can only think of one off the top of my head and it was a guy like you said just had pre-existing
01:33:19.22 --> 01:33:25.30 Children injury that was like that was like a tap and then I'm hurt and then my shoulders bad right
01:33:25.70 --> 01:33:29.70 Bro you're rolling with me. Yeah. Tell me and there's a black belt, you know
01:33:29.70 --> 01:33:32.34 It was like pro come on. Not a guy that's seen you in a while
01:33:32.58 --> 01:33:34.58 But I just go you know big strong guy
01:33:34.98 --> 01:33:37.62 Got got the computer and I put it on and all the sudden he's like
01:33:37.62 --> 01:33:44.90 Yeah, and injured yeah and and I just said bro and it was I mean I know the complete limitations of where
01:33:45.46 --> 01:33:50.58 It's injury or not and I was not there yet at all yeah, and so he's like you're gonna bad shoulder
01:33:50.58 --> 01:33:56.02 I should have told you yeah, yeah, and that's actually why I felt really guilty because I did I was like well
01:33:56.02 --> 01:33:59.06 You want to go hard so I did it hard. I wasn't trying to hurt him but
01:33:59.78 --> 01:34:01.78 If he was had a bad shoulder which he did
01:34:01.78 --> 01:34:09.54 I understand you hurt him and I that doesn't surprise me that in her and I shouldn't I shouldn't have went that hard to begin with as far as like going
01:34:09.54 --> 01:34:11.38 I know how to do it. You can more good yeah
01:34:11.94 --> 01:34:16.02 And just kind of declare if I'm my earlier statements like when somebody goes level nine on me
01:34:16.18 --> 01:34:20.82 It doesn't mean I'm like out to you right. I just I just know I just go I just apply
01:34:22.18 --> 01:34:26.82 Level if they're level nine. I'm gonna apply level nine point one back to them and put them
01:34:26.82 --> 01:34:30.66 Yeah, and actually usually I do something to him that forces them to calm down
01:34:30.66 --> 01:34:35.86 Like I'll just put I'll get across side and be like keep spashing keep going nuts right now
01:34:36.26 --> 01:34:39.22 I'm just gonna be here we're cruising yeah
01:34:39.86 --> 01:34:45.38 At level nine point one, but just level nine point one, but completely cruising because they can't move
01:34:45.38 --> 01:34:49.86 They're freaking fucking and going crazy and getting nuts and then you're just sitting there. Yeah
01:34:50.66 --> 01:34:51.86 Yeah
01:34:51.86 --> 01:34:55.46 But yeah, I still feel guilty about that day. I'll never do it again
01:34:56.66 --> 01:34:58.66 Next question
01:34:58.66 --> 01:35:00.66 Hi, Jockel
01:35:01.38 --> 01:35:06.10 I have read your book extreme ownership from cover to cover and I learned for a lot from it
01:35:07.22 --> 01:35:09.46 And I have a question that bothers me
01:35:11.94 --> 01:35:17.06 The question is how can I be noticed by the people and get chosen for a leader?
01:35:19.54 --> 01:35:26.34 Okay, good kind of another question that I hear you know people get worried that if they're just
01:35:26.34 --> 01:35:31.70 Kind of putting their head down and working then they were not gonna get noticed. I don't get noticed. I'll be coming leader
01:35:31.94 --> 01:35:33.94 Stop worrying about being noticed
01:35:34.50 --> 01:35:37.70 That's number one stop worrying about being noticed and keep working hard
01:35:39.22 --> 01:35:44.98 Stop worrying about being chosen as a leader if you're going to get chosen as a leader
01:35:46.58 --> 01:35:47.54 No
01:35:47.54 --> 01:35:48.74 Work hard
01:35:48.74 --> 01:35:55.78 Actually work really hard and then put the team first so all these thoughts and efforts that you have around getting
01:35:55.78 --> 01:36:02.82 Notice them being recognized instead of having them focused on being recognized and being noticed put those thoughts on making the team successful
01:36:04.74 --> 01:36:06.74 Wow
01:36:06.74 --> 01:36:07.70 Wow
01:36:07.70 --> 01:36:09.70 Put the team first. That's what I'm saying
01:36:10.34 --> 01:36:17.38 Right now with this question you're actually putting yourself yourself recognition above the team so instead of
01:36:18.66 --> 01:36:23.54 Thinking about that think about how you can help the team win and the more of a team player you are
01:36:23.54 --> 01:36:31.38 The more people will want to work with you the more you help the team win the more people say
01:36:31.38 --> 01:36:39.06 I want you on my team and eventually they say okay, you know what? I want you to lead this team because you want this team to win so bad
01:36:39.06 --> 01:36:41.06 We want you to lead this team
01:36:41.78 --> 01:36:43.78 So that is what you do now
01:36:44.42 --> 01:36:51.06 That being said right there's always there's always a balance because I'm not saying that you sit back and just
01:36:51.06 --> 01:36:55.62 And keep your fingers crossed that if you work hard, everyone's gonna notice you now with this guy
01:36:55.94 --> 01:37:00.58 Who's all worried about being noticed don't worry about being noticed you're gonna get noticed if you work out and put your head down
01:37:00.98 --> 01:37:03.30 But there's some people that they're they're so
01:37:04.50 --> 01:37:06.50 They might be so humble
01:37:06.50 --> 01:37:09.30 That they're not gonna get noticed for what they're doing
01:37:09.46 --> 01:37:11.46 So how do you overcome that well?
01:37:11.94 --> 01:37:19.10 This doesn't mean that you sit back in your passive. There's a I'll tell you the best way to stand out or one of the best ways to stand out is
01:37:19.10 --> 01:37:21.10 Volunteer
01:37:21.50 --> 01:37:26.30 Volunteer for everything that comes up and then crush it the crappy jobs that no one wants
01:37:26.94 --> 01:37:28.94 Volunteer for those things
01:37:29.42 --> 01:37:34.22 That's what I used to see you see the young new guys in the seal teams. That's how you tell
01:37:35.50 --> 01:37:40.62 You get some crappy job you walk out to a group of guys going through training
01:37:40.62 --> 01:37:49.02 Fifth if a bunch of both team guys near hey, I need three guys there'd be like two new guys that would just be like by their hands
01:37:49.02 --> 01:37:53.02 It'd be up before you could get done saying the sentence and you just see the look on their face
01:37:53.02 --> 01:37:55.90 One of they want to do they just want to win and use I love those guys
01:37:56.14 --> 01:37:58.38 They just like oh, I'll do that. Hey, what hey?
01:37:58.38 --> 01:38:03.26 I need a couple guys to boom their hands are up. You know you know gonna say go clean the sewer out
01:38:03.50 --> 01:38:05.50 They don't care they don't care
01:38:05.50 --> 01:38:08.62 They're volunteering for everything and you know what I got this when I got to the team
01:38:08.62 --> 01:38:12.06 That's what I did volunteered for every as a matter of fact
01:38:12.06 --> 01:38:17.10 I volunteered to be a radio man because I had heard that it was a really hard job that no one wanted
01:38:17.74 --> 01:38:21.82 It was like oh, okay. I'll do that job. You got a job that's really hard no one wants carrying a heavy weight
01:38:21.82 --> 01:38:23.82 You don't get to shoot it
01:38:23.82 --> 01:38:28.22 Right you get to carry a number 60 there's a major benefit to that that is you get to unload
01:38:28.70 --> 01:38:33.26 Massive amounts of firepower you carry a radio you're just sitting around with batteries
01:38:33.66 --> 01:38:37.26 Kind of hardcore in a different way. It is it is and I luckily
01:38:37.26 --> 01:38:42.22 I got I got told two things number one that no one wanted that job a number two that if you were radio
01:38:42.22 --> 01:38:45.66 And you'd go on every mission because they always need a radio man. That's not only a lot of me
01:38:45.66 --> 01:38:49.26 I want to go on every mission so I'll take I'll carry that radio
01:38:50.30 --> 01:38:54.06 But that and everything you know you just volunteer for everything so that's
01:38:55.74 --> 01:39:01.18 That's one of the best ways that you can make a good impression is by volunteering for stuff and then
01:39:01.74 --> 01:39:06.06 Crushing it and eventually people look at you and they say how this guy doesn't care what we give him
01:39:06.06 --> 01:39:12.06 He's gonna crush this task and you know what people like work with him because he's worried about the team and this person seems like a
01:39:12.30 --> 01:39:14.46 Bloods get let's give him a little task. I'll then lead something
01:39:15.34 --> 01:39:18.06 Because sometimes you're going to volunteer for something you're volunteering for a leadership position
01:39:18.06 --> 01:39:20.46 Hey, I need four guys one of those people is gonna be in charge
01:39:20.78 --> 01:39:26.30 Right for it's not gonna be four guys going equally into some thing right? No, someone's gonna be in charge
01:39:26.30 --> 01:39:28.70 Reaction yeah, someone's gonna take charge of it be that person
01:39:30.14 --> 01:39:32.14 Yes, good this
01:39:32.14 --> 01:39:36.86 Um when he said how can I be noticed so to work hard?
01:39:37.42 --> 01:39:41.10 Yeah, but you know it's like okay, that's what I want I want to be noticed right?
01:39:41.58 --> 01:39:49.42 So you're walking to bar or something and a girl walks in and she you can tell she's trying to be noticed
01:39:50.14 --> 01:39:54.54 The bad luck man, so what I'm saying is you like if you're trying to be
01:39:54.54 --> 01:39:58.38 You know people can see that stuff like this cuz it's trying to be noticed right here
01:39:58.38 --> 01:40:00.38 And it doesn't opposite obviously
01:40:00.38 --> 01:40:03.50 And it that's yeah, you're right. That's the hardest thing to
01:40:04.46 --> 01:40:07.74 Convince of people convince people love is the fact that if you're just
01:40:08.38 --> 01:40:12.06 If you're just working hard you'll get noticed you will get noticed
01:40:12.86 --> 01:40:15.26 It's like um you do something kind of good or whatever
01:40:15.58 --> 01:40:20.46 Brave I don't know hey look did you guys all see how brave I was right there? Yeah, yeah
01:40:20.46 --> 01:40:23.26 Yeah, no one wants you to be a little leader all right there
01:40:24.62 --> 01:40:26.62 Like saying ham look hey guys
01:40:26.62 --> 01:40:33.34 That task I did pretty good right I was really humble no one's no one's humble in me no one's
01:40:33.34 --> 01:40:41.10 Well, I'm gonna stop worrying about you and think of helping the team and volunteer a bunch and that's that's where you end up in a leadership position
01:40:42.14 --> 01:40:44.14 Yeah
01:40:44.78 --> 01:40:50.46 Got time for one more yeah, might as well last question question for Uncle Jake from James who's nine
01:40:50.46 --> 01:40:55.18 Can you be weak but strong at the same time?
01:40:57.10 --> 01:40:59.10 Can you be
01:40:59.34 --> 01:41:04.30 Week but strong at the same time. Yes, you can you can't because you can be
01:41:05.42 --> 01:41:07.42 For instance you can be physically strong
01:41:09.02 --> 01:41:15.02 But at the same time you could be mentally weak or you could be the opposite you could be mentally weak
01:41:15.02 --> 01:41:21.74 But at the same time physically strong and I would love to be able to
01:41:22.54 --> 01:41:30.54 Put a priority on one of those and I know I've said before that knowledge is the most important thing
01:41:32.94 --> 01:41:34.62 But the reality is if you don't have
01:41:35.58 --> 01:41:38.54 the strength or actually the health
01:41:38.54 --> 01:41:49.58 To back that up or even to function as a human being physically then your knowledge and your mental strength doesn't really even matter
01:41:51.90 --> 01:41:53.10 So
01:41:53.10 --> 01:41:55.66 That comes into play and being
01:41:55.90 --> 01:41:59.18 Big and strong is also totally useless
01:42:00.06 --> 01:42:03.02 If you're mentally weak and you quit
01:42:03.02 --> 01:42:05.02 Hmm
01:42:06.46 --> 01:42:13.58 Now being mentally strong should actually lead you to being physically strong because if you are mentally strong
01:42:14.06 --> 01:42:19.02 Then you can work and train to become physically strong
01:42:21.82 --> 01:42:23.82 But if you're
01:42:24.38 --> 01:42:26.14 Mentally weak
01:42:26.14 --> 01:42:32.46 Then you will not hold the line on the good food and the good workouts and you won't
01:42:32.46 --> 01:42:36.30 Get physically strong or healthy
01:42:40.14 --> 01:42:42.14 So
01:42:43.18 --> 01:42:49.82 Can you be weak and strong at the same time? Yes, but I say be strong
01:42:51.66 --> 01:42:59.50 Train your physical strength and exercise your mental strength by doing the right things the hard things
01:42:59.50 --> 01:43:05.10 The things you know you're supposed to do
01:43:07.34 --> 01:43:09.34 Do them and
01:43:10.14 --> 01:43:13.18 Be as strong as you can mentally
01:43:13.98 --> 01:43:17.18 Physically and emotionally for yourself
01:43:18.38 --> 01:43:20.38 for your team
01:43:20.86 --> 01:43:22.86 for your family
01:43:23.58 --> 01:43:25.58 Hold the line
01:43:25.58 --> 01:43:27.58 and be strong
01:43:30.86 --> 01:43:32.86 And I think
01:43:33.18 --> 01:43:36.38 That's all I've got for tonight. So
01:43:37.90 --> 01:43:42.14 Echo Charles speaking of holding the line
01:43:44.14 --> 01:43:50.54 Perhaps you could hold your portion of the line here and explain to people how they can support this podcast

01:45:06.06 --> 01:45:14.22 Like joint supplements like krill oil you know the these are these supplements help me way more than any protein powder and back in the
01:45:15.10 --> 01:45:18.22 I used to take protein powder and you know these

01:46:04.86 --> 01:46:10.46 I mean to other lifting too of course, but kettle bells are a bigger part of my routine and just slowly
01:46:10.46 --> 01:46:16.54 I kind of get more like when you get stronger you get the bigger one I took a I stood back the other day when I was lifting
01:46:17.10 --> 01:46:19.42 stood back and looked at my set up
01:46:19.42 --> 01:46:26.22 It's pretty dope. I don't have like the normal kettle bells. It's like I have this one

01:49:54.62 --> 01:49:56.62 if you want to
01:49:56.62 --> 01:49:58.62 Also joc was a store
01:49:58.62 --> 01:50:03.34 It's called joc was store joc was door.com on there there are t shirts travel mugs
01:50:04.62 --> 01:50:09.74 Some bumper stickers. We might be out of bumper stickers. No, no, we're both bumper stickers some women stuff on there
01:50:10.38 --> 01:50:12.38 some shirts of course
01:50:12.54 --> 01:50:18.70 With like we haven't talked about the layers on the shirts recently. That's really disappointing to everyone
01:50:19.02 --> 01:50:24.30 Or you talk about the layers on the shirts, but or maybe that in and of itself is a layer
01:50:24.30 --> 01:50:28.46 Right, you just don't talk about the layers you just let them exist
01:50:29.26 --> 01:50:33.90 Layers that's a layer and it's own right that's what I mean layers are just there. Yeah, exactly right so
01:50:34.54 --> 01:50:39.50 That is pretty lame if you have to describe the layers. Yeah, it's like describing like the punchline of a joke
01:50:39.50 --> 01:50:43.26 Right, it's not a Johnny. Yeah, yeah, it's just a whack joke
01:50:44.38 --> 01:50:46.38 Either way some shirts on there
01:50:46.38 --> 01:50:53.58 Also rashguards. I think we're doing a warrior kid rashguard. Oh nice we're doing with Pete. Oh nice American made
01:50:54.62 --> 01:50:57.34 Warrior kid rashguards nice
01:50:58.30 --> 01:51:02.06 One side says win of the side says learned in the back says
01:51:03.02 --> 01:51:05.02 This is the but everything
01:51:05.02 --> 01:51:07.02 They're gonna be good credit
01:51:07.74 --> 01:51:12.94 How far out of those from being released? Oh, we're narrowing down the cut, you know
01:51:12.94 --> 01:51:17.10 Because kids are I'm tough talking of Pete. He's like kids are shaped different
01:51:17.10 --> 01:51:21.42 There's just shape kind of weird so you got to kind of there's some refining that kind of has to go into the shape
01:51:21.42 --> 01:51:23.42 But yeah, that's more or less it
01:51:23.42 --> 01:51:26.94 Yeah, also some I said women stuff, but yeah some uh hoodies
01:51:28.06 --> 01:51:32.22 Who do you should be should be available nice? It's not right this moment
01:51:33.34 --> 01:51:38.94 They're available this moment they're common yeah, yeah thick winter hoodies either way and if you go on there
01:51:38.94 --> 01:51:42.46 And if it's if something's out which especially now like I'm trying I'm really
01:51:43.58 --> 01:51:45.66 Narywing down my whole process there
01:51:45.66 --> 01:51:49.50 But if something's out of stock or whatever there's a little thing on there you just put your email in there
01:51:49.50 --> 01:51:52.38 I don't it's not a spam thing at all in fact a lot of people
01:51:53.50 --> 01:51:56.78 Sign up for email list which is another thing like I really said much
01:51:57.34 --> 01:52:01.34 The point and not that that's a good thing, but I'm saying you know sometimes I get contact with these people
01:52:03.02 --> 01:52:08.62 With their advice about stuff and I'm not I'm not trying to say I'm like I'm not being
01:52:08.62 --> 01:52:12.70 Ergon, right but there the people that talked to me about like
01:52:14.54 --> 01:52:16.54 What is it building the oh?
01:52:16.54 --> 01:52:21.98 The okay, oh about the podcast like the brand yeah, if you do more social media, yeah, no, they say
01:52:21.98 --> 01:52:25.66 You know the one of the most valuable things you could do is get a email list
01:52:26.14 --> 01:52:30.86 You get a big email list then you can hammer and stuff all the time and then and you haven't forever
01:52:32.46 --> 01:52:34.46 I'm bro
01:52:34.46 --> 01:52:35.66 You know
01:52:35.66 --> 01:52:43.18 We're not here to just like hammer people with uh whatever messaging yeah, so yeah, you can sign up for it
01:52:43.58 --> 01:52:45.90 The email list that you made I mean
01:52:46.70 --> 01:52:52.14 What I put out like one thing or maybe two things on it you put out maybe two things or three things
01:52:52.70 --> 01:52:57.50 What you do one thing you do that's good as you give you this is where it's beneficial if you want something
01:52:57.50 --> 01:53:03.58 You'll find out about it earlier, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yes, and also you've let you've you've done some
01:53:03.58 --> 01:53:09.42 Apolling like hey what color of this should we make so yeah, yeah, and that's really what it is
01:53:09.42 --> 01:53:14.86 It's more like a direct line like people who like like I care like if a new item comes out item
01:53:15.42 --> 01:53:20.22 Something new on the store comes out or something something super relevant like I'm not gonna be like
01:53:20.22 --> 01:53:25.26 Hey, by the way, let me just send you this that you won't read or I don't know like I won't just I don't use it to
01:53:25.98 --> 01:53:31.74 I don't think it should be used ever, but so I don't use it to try to like keep your attention on my website
01:53:31.74 --> 01:53:35.74 You know, it's not that I figure I looked at it kind of like
01:53:37.02 --> 01:53:42.70 I forget if I heard someone say this or not, but it was really made sense where you know when you sign up for an email list
01:53:42.70 --> 01:53:47.34 Right, so a marketer a quote unquote marketer will look at that and be like, okay
01:53:47.34 --> 01:53:50.14 They just signed it signed up to be marketed to
01:53:50.30 --> 01:53:52.30 Right, so
01:53:52.54 --> 01:53:58.14 Every time I enter in my email for like do you want updates, you know, I like you've never in my email for those things
01:53:58.14 --> 01:54:04.70 Which is kind of part of the point because you know I'm sign signing up right now to mark getting marketed to so
01:54:05.26 --> 01:54:09.66 People in a sign up they say okay, I want to be marketed to I'm not gonna like abuse like I'm not gonna
01:54:10.06 --> 01:54:13.10 Instantly violate your choice now. Let me mail to people
01:54:14.06 --> 01:54:19.74 If I just figure if you truly believe that like that's what they sign up for
01:54:20.06 --> 01:54:26.62 No, no, I'm saying should I send out like an email of information or something? Yeah, yeah, so yeah exactly
01:54:26.62 --> 01:54:32.14 Yes, so that's what I should do if if you think okay, so think of me as like a person who's like
01:54:32.14 --> 01:54:37.90 Yeah, I'll sign up for this email is oh and so I put my email in there and then so now your contemplation
01:54:37.90 --> 01:54:43.26 I send them an email if you think that that email legitimately is what I want to get from you
01:54:43.74 --> 01:54:47.42 When I put my email then yeah, send that you don't even know what that is
01:54:47.42 --> 01:54:49.90 So that's why I hardly send anything. I just figure hey if there's a new
01:54:50.22 --> 01:54:53.98 Rache guard especially when people on Twitter or Instagram whatever telling me
01:54:53.98 --> 01:54:59.66 Hey do this for a rash guard or hey do this for a shirt or where when the hats come in out when the hoodie you know when's the hoodie?
01:54:59.66 --> 01:55:03.66 I've been you know waiting for the kids size small
01:55:03.66 --> 01:55:07.42 We're email you eat you so for instance this is a good one you will email when the
01:55:08.06 --> 01:55:09.90 When the new hoodies are available
01:55:09.90 --> 01:55:16.62 You email everyone yeah, and actually I did one better where I don't even have to email everybody because what if people are like already have a hoodie
01:55:17.10 --> 01:55:20.30 So I get there on the list all do you one better on the hoodie
01:55:20.30 --> 01:55:27.50 On the store when you click on the hoodie yeah select the size and it's out you can just be like oh put your email right there
01:55:27.50 --> 01:55:29.50 You will only get emailed
01:55:29.50 --> 01:55:33.98 If the hoodie gets back and stock in your specific size otherwise you don't get nothing
01:55:33.98 --> 01:55:36.94 I'm not gonna bother your inbox your inbox is sacred
01:55:37.34 --> 01:55:39.90 Okay, just because you gave me the key doesn't mean I show up every day
01:55:40.94 --> 01:55:46.78 So cool like that. Yeah, I think so I think that's the way to go so marketers whoever's listening this right now
01:55:46.78 --> 01:55:51.98 That's that's like each you're doing you miss now on so much opportunity to violate people
01:55:51.98 --> 01:55:54.94 Yeah, we're not gonna violate people's trust for opportunity good job
01:55:55.50 --> 01:55:57.50 Yeah

01:58:43.50 --> 01:58:48.86 It's for kids, but I think we can all learn from it. I know I learned from it from good old uncle Jake
01:58:48.86 --> 01:58:53.98 Got a book called Extreme Ownership which is a book about leadership combat leadership lessons learned
01:58:54.54 --> 01:58:58.14 Also have a book called this one equals freedom field manual
01:58:59.10 --> 01:59:01.10 Just came out October 17th
01:59:01.90 --> 01:59:06.94 I'm gonna read you the lexer first excerpt coming from the end of reason I'm reading this is
01:59:09.58 --> 01:59:14.94 a few weeks ago there was a mass shooting in Vegas horrible situation and
01:59:14.94 --> 01:59:16.94 I
01:59:17.74 --> 01:59:23.82 Deal talk about all kinds of different things in this book about my life things I've learned and
01:59:24.46 --> 01:59:27.58 One of the things one of the sections and here's called immediate action drills
01:59:28.46 --> 01:59:29.66 Here we go
01:59:29.66 --> 01:59:35.26 Back to the book, but we can't always avoid high threat areas and sometimes the high threat area
01:59:35.90 --> 01:59:40.62 Doesn't avoid us in the world today conflict and danger can occur at any time anywhere
01:59:40.62 --> 01:59:48.38 So it is important to maintain situational awareness at all times pay attention to your surroundings look at suspicious people
01:59:48.78 --> 01:59:55.18 Look at unsuspectious people what are they doing where are they going what are they looking at a
01:59:55.58 --> 01:59:58.58 Sess while you assess
01:59:58.86 --> 02:00:00.86 Think of contingencies
02:00:01.26 --> 02:00:03.26 Where is your closest to scape route?
02:00:03.90 --> 02:00:09.70 Where is the closest cover and concealment cover being a place to shield you from bullets and
02:00:09.70 --> 02:00:11.70 Concealment being a place to hide
02:00:13.14 --> 02:00:17.78 If you are maintaining situational awareness you should be very hard to surprise
02:00:18.58 --> 02:00:24.10 If you send something is going wrong or you sense a threat proactively move away from it
02:00:24.42 --> 02:00:30.58 Walk to the other side of the street accelerate your car walk out the door. Don't wait for things to get worse
02:00:31.86 --> 02:00:36.82 If you do get surprised and are caught in a bad situation act
02:00:36.82 --> 02:00:44.26 If you can run away from an assailant do it if you can't run because they have a hold on you attack them
02:00:45.30 --> 02:00:52.90 Put all your training to use as quickly and as violently as possible as soon as you can break free do it and run
02:00:54.74 --> 02:00:56.98 If shooting starts get down
02:00:58.42 --> 02:01:04.42 Call the police at the first opportunity if the shooting is single shots being fired at a slower pace
02:01:04.42 --> 02:01:06.98 Run immediately and keep running
02:01:08.10 --> 02:01:14.34 If the shooting is rapid fire find some solid cover to get behind wait for a low
02:01:15.46 --> 02:01:19.78 When the low comes run that may be your only chance
02:01:21.38 --> 02:01:24.54 If you are trapped in a room with an active shooter outside
02:01:24.98 --> 02:01:26.98 Barricade yourself
02:01:26.98 --> 02:01:31.50 If there is no if there is an ideal hiding place hide if not
02:01:31.50 --> 02:01:38.78 Prepare to attack them as soon as they enter the room get anyone in the room with you on board and ready to swarm the attacker
02:01:41.82 --> 02:01:50.62 So those are some notes from where to start and again you can take training for those type of situations
02:01:51.26 --> 02:01:56.54 To a very high degree, but if you have no training you need to know what to do in those situations
02:01:56.54 --> 02:02:01.90 That's that's why I put that in there you know
02:02:01.90 --> 02:02:08.38 I'll read this one more little section because I get asked this all the time of this to be getting the section dealing with injuries and illness
02:02:09.82 --> 02:02:11.82 What are you
02:02:11.82 --> 02:02:13.82 You are going to get injured
02:02:14.38 --> 02:02:21.26 You are going to get sick regardless of how careful you are in your training how clean you eat and how healthy you live
02:02:21.26 --> 02:02:23.26 You are still human
02:02:23.26 --> 02:02:26.70 Injuries and illness will occur
02:02:27.90 --> 02:02:32.38 My theory for overcoming injuries and illness is simple
02:02:33.26 --> 02:02:35.26 Do what you can
02:02:35.66 --> 02:02:42.54 If you are sick or injured don't use that as an excuse to skip workouts or stay in bed all day do what you can
02:02:43.66 --> 02:02:45.66 hurt your knee
02:02:45.66 --> 02:02:47.26 Work your upper body
02:02:47.26 --> 02:02:52.14 Work the good leg hurt your shoulder time to work on one arm to pull ups and pushups
02:02:52.14 --> 02:02:55.90 Focus on your core and legs until your shoulder heals up
02:02:57.10 --> 02:03:05.26 Ten to night is from using the grip too much sound like it's time to focus on sprinting and jumping plyometrics
02:03:06.54 --> 02:03:08.54 Got a little cold flu
02:03:09.26 --> 02:03:10.62 Same thing
02:03:10.62 --> 02:03:12.62 Do what you can
02:03:12.62 --> 02:03:18.94 Maybe it's just going for a walk a couple sets of sit ups and pushups, but don't just stay in bed all day
02:03:18.94 --> 02:03:20.94 So
02:03:21.90 --> 02:03:26.38 Go on to talk about some more that this book is called this funny close freedom and
02:03:27.98 --> 02:03:29.98 If you want to help spread the word on this
02:03:32.38 --> 02:03:38.86 Go and buy from a local bookstore like an independent bookstore because when they sell these books
02:03:38.86 --> 02:03:47.82 They report it in such a way that it helps the book get recognized by some of the bigger media outlets and
02:03:48.94 --> 02:03:56.94 When it gets recognized by some of those big media outlets like the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal that helps spread the word even more and
02:03:58.54 --> 02:04:04.22 I think that the word that's in this book should be spread because I think it's going to help a lot of people and I think it's going to help them
02:04:04.22 --> 02:04:11.82 Live better healthier and more productive lives so you can get that book this funny close freedom field manual
