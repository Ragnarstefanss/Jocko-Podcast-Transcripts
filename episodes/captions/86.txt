00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.30 This is Jockel Podcast number 86 with echo Charles and me Jockel Willink
00:00:07.02 --> 00:00:14.12 Good evening echo good evening and it has been a little while since we got down to some
00:00:14.76 --> 00:00:17.26 Q&A sure and on top of that
00:00:18.84 --> 00:00:22.04 On the social media I have not been as
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:29.84 As responsive as I normally am I've had to prioritize and execute a bunch of other things
00:00:30.56 --> 00:00:32.92 Things like master things like books that are due
00:00:34.16 --> 00:00:36.16 Things like that so
00:00:36.96 --> 00:00:41.32 And a bunch of travel and a bunch of work with echelon front etc etc
00:00:41.40 --> 00:00:49.24 So but I do get the questions. I read the questions. I read the I read if you post something and you tag me in it on Twitter
00:00:49.24 --> 00:00:55.24 Or you put a comment on Instagram. I read it 100% yeah, I read it
00:00:56.44 --> 00:01:01.96 But lately and normally I would like everything that I see sure I would like just so you know hey
00:01:01.96 --> 00:01:04.92 I saw it down got you yeah, I'm here. I heard you
00:01:05.48 --> 00:01:10.56 But lately I haven't even will do that. So so I've just been I read it move read it move read it move
00:01:11.12 --> 00:01:13.60 But if there's a good question comes up I
00:01:13.60 --> 00:01:18.12 Copy it. I paste it. I put it in the in the question bank and
00:01:20.92 --> 00:01:29.64 Then when we get to do a Q&A we answer the questions that I think either they get asked a bunch
00:01:30.52 --> 00:01:34.12 You know, so I've seen a little question four or five times that type of question yeah
00:01:34.44 --> 00:01:39.58 Or just a unique question that I think a lot of people can benefit from and that's where we end up with so today
00:01:40.48 --> 00:01:42.48 Q&A
00:01:42.48 --> 00:01:45.68 And let's rock and roll first question
00:01:46.68 --> 00:01:48.68 I do want to add that on Twitter
00:01:49.24 --> 00:01:51.24 So seed also
00:01:51.24 --> 00:01:55.68 You know you say you like everything you know, yes certain things sometimes
00:01:56.48 --> 00:02:01.44 They don't necessarily warrant like you like you know, they require an answer, you know like you can't like
00:02:01.44 --> 00:02:07.56 Like let's say someone has this like really trying time or something and they say something or whatever and it's a question
00:02:07.56 --> 00:02:13.40 Like hey, how do I get through this you can't just like it and move on okay, I can't do that so what what I do in those situations is
00:02:13.40 --> 00:02:21.36 I like it I copy the question and I put it in the question bank. Okay, so your like is my like is
00:02:21.36 --> 00:02:25.56 Serious meanings my like does not mean like yeah, yeah, yeah, my like means
00:02:26.72 --> 00:02:31.52 Receive gotcha. Yes, yeah, and and and it is a heart
00:02:31.52 --> 00:02:38.72 Yeah, which I the heimately disagree disapprove of and disagree riff you know like hearts no
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:42.32 No, I'm not
00:02:42.32 --> 00:02:44.32 No, no hearts
00:02:44.32 --> 00:02:47.32 It's world right so
00:02:47.84 --> 00:02:51.28 But I do it's my way of saying I read it, but what I'm saying is
00:02:52.32 --> 00:02:56.56 It's saying that I'm read it and telling you that right at this the past like week
00:02:56.56 --> 00:03:02.64 I've read everything I always read everything but I haven't even liked them because I haven't had time to start liking them
00:03:02.64 --> 00:03:04.64 I think yes because
00:03:04.96 --> 00:03:06.96 If I like it that tells me
00:03:07.92 --> 00:03:11.68 that I've gone through it and if I had to pull something from it
00:03:12.88 --> 00:03:18.22 It's how I keep track of what I've read and what ever not just what I've read it's how I keep track of what I have
00:03:18.86 --> 00:03:19.96 Extracted
00:03:19.96 --> 00:03:22.46 Purt and information from yeah
00:03:22.46 --> 00:03:28.26 I might have to start doing the opposite only like something if I want to go back to it. Oh, yeah, like a bookmark
00:03:28.26 --> 00:03:35.10 Yeah, maybe I'll start doing that. But anyways if you're out there. I'm reading your messages
00:03:35.74 --> 00:03:37.74 your tweets
00:03:37.98 --> 00:03:43.02 Your posts right and appreciate it. It's all good feedback. It's awesome. Yeah
00:03:43.82 --> 00:03:49.46 But sometimes you get yours you're in the initial post will say and maybe I'm in there
00:03:49.46 --> 00:03:54.22 Maybe some other people and then other people chime in then it starts to morph into this conversation between two other people
00:03:54.38 --> 00:03:56.74 Yeah, you can't really like those necessary
00:03:56.74 --> 00:04:01.18 I mean you can't usually do but just to keep track of where I am just like like like like like the bookmark. Yeah
00:04:01.18 --> 00:04:06.26 to bookmark so this you talking right now is just one big mass like
00:04:06.98 --> 00:04:11.78 Yes, hey guys are ready. Here's you for all your lives. Yes. I like like you all
00:04:12.34 --> 00:04:16.94 I mean I like you all because some of your comments are don't like yeah. I still like them though. Yeah
00:04:16.94 --> 00:04:22.26 Verb like yeah, yeah, yeah, I like a press like even though you said something I don't agree with
00:04:22.62 --> 00:04:29.48 So I still like like like like that you express yourself. Yeah, kind of it. So even if I hate what you said
00:04:29.66 --> 00:04:31.66 You still get a little heart
00:04:33.42 --> 00:04:38.92 There you go. They should have one that's an eye like a picture of an eye like I've seen this that sort of means
00:04:38.92 --> 00:04:45.50 And I all right right now. I saw this I saw this. I saw this and then you could say like and you should have a thumbs down
00:04:45.50 --> 00:04:50.18 Dislike yeah like on YouTube. Yeah, yeah
00:04:50.86 --> 00:04:59.78 Either way. There you go. All right first question. Hey, Jocco. I'm a 35 year old and have a physically demanding job
00:05:00.28 --> 00:05:02.96 I've been a dry waller for about 14 years
00:05:03.16 --> 00:05:10.50 Work about 8 to 10 hours a day when it comes to working out. I'm finding it really hard to maintain discipline to continue as it seems as
00:05:10.50 --> 00:05:12.50 It seems I burn out
00:05:12.50 --> 00:05:16.22 I'll have two boys under the age of four so I sleep like you do
00:05:17.22 --> 00:05:19.22 I can't even
00:05:19.22 --> 00:05:25.46 I'm wondering if I'm just being a pussy and need to push through the burnout or take a different approach to working out
00:05:25.78 --> 00:05:27.94 When I burn out my body just feels weird
00:05:29.06 --> 00:05:33.26 As well as my head I tend to get depressed and find it hard to even go to work
00:05:34.30 --> 00:05:40.78 Just throwing this out there for maybe some tips to get over this so I can stay focused and consistent
00:05:40.78 --> 00:05:42.78 Thanks cool
00:05:43.06 --> 00:05:49.10 Okay, so hanging drywall. You haven't hung drywall before? No, yes, no, but yes, okay
00:05:49.10 --> 00:05:53.14 I don't know what that answer means I've been in a drywall hanging
00:05:54.06 --> 00:05:58.98 scenario yes, but I didn't do the scene of the drywall. Okay. Yeah, that does not qualify
00:06:02.98 --> 00:06:06.26 Call me if you've seen it being done
00:06:06.26 --> 00:06:12.90 I appreciate what you're trying to say but that does work hanging drywall is hard work. Yes, it uses a bunch of different
00:06:13.38 --> 00:06:19.54 Muscles in your body and of course when you get better at it because I'm not good at it when I when I hung drywall when I hang drywall
00:06:19.54 --> 00:06:24.10 If I'm doing a project, I'm not good at it. Yeah, if you see someone that's good at like this guy
00:06:24.10 --> 00:06:30.86 That's been hanging drywall for 14 years. He's a master. Yeah, he's he's holding one hand slapping nails
00:06:30.86 --> 00:06:37.04 I mean, he's or drywall screws on stills guys work on stills. You've seen that before no, no, so good drywall
00:06:37.04 --> 00:06:40.50 They're on stills because they don't they're just boom slapping it up there
00:06:40.90 --> 00:06:47.36 So but it's hard you're doing you're basically doing a clean kind of pull the the drywall up
00:06:47.36 --> 00:06:50.000 You're pushing it up your using your grip strength and the drywall
00:06:50.38 --> 00:06:53.46 Then you're doing the overhead presses because you drywall ceilings
00:06:54.02 --> 00:06:59.86 Sometimes so and it's eight to ten hours plus not to mention you're you're bending down picking stuff up all day
00:06:59.86 --> 00:07:01.34 So it's eight to ten hours of squats
00:07:02.86 --> 00:07:09.42 Cleans and overhead presses with grip work. So you're doing that eight to ten hours a day. So
00:07:10.26 --> 00:07:13.42 You're getting good physical work throughout the day now
00:07:14.62 --> 00:07:17.06 Oh, look man if you're that drained
00:07:17.62 --> 00:07:19.62 then first of all, let's check the diet
00:07:19.62 --> 00:07:26.22 Let's make sure that we're not on the job site and the donut truck arrives and you're you're going belly up the donut truck
00:07:26.22 --> 00:07:31.90 With a monster four monster energy drinks like to keep you going through day. That's gonna hurt you
00:07:32.22 --> 00:07:38.78 So check the diet. It's the good thing is check the diet and then if you have to just bring your food
00:07:38.78 --> 00:07:40.78 Don't let you know
00:07:40.78 --> 00:07:45.58 Your bro that's gonna run down to make you these to grab lunch because you didn't pack anything
00:07:45.58 --> 00:07:47.06 That's gonna jack you up
00:07:47.22 --> 00:07:49.78 So all that stuff will make you feel
00:07:50.02 --> 00:07:51.50 week and
00:07:51.50 --> 00:07:57.58 Out of sorts and all that that being said still you're working hard all day you're doing hard physical labor all day
00:07:58.74 --> 00:08:04.34 You also I mean you can see construction workers or drywalls you can see people that are do that hard labor all day
00:08:04.34 --> 00:08:06.86 And they don't look like they're in shape right?
00:08:07.26 --> 00:08:10.98 They're maybe they're fat maybe they're just they don't look like they're in shape
00:08:11.18 --> 00:08:13.18 Well, that's because they're diet sucks
00:08:13.98 --> 00:08:19.82 Generally they're coming home and they're getting on their they're 12 pack of beer and pizza
00:08:19.82 --> 00:08:21.82 So
00:08:21.62 --> 00:08:27.38 Get your diet make sure you're done. It's good to go and then what I would do is and I've worked some trucks before and
00:08:28.78 --> 00:08:32.58 We're even made projects on my house where I'm working all day long
00:08:33.38 --> 00:08:37.74 Remodeling pulling down drywall, putting up drywall demo in rooms whatever
00:08:38.78 --> 00:08:45.62 I still do we work out now what you're gonna do though is do something that is going to complement
00:08:45.62 --> 00:08:51.66 What you've done during the day so you're getting some pretty good strength for work at this point
00:08:52.30 --> 00:08:56.62 You're getting you know you're getting clean your grip work. You're doing all this this hard work
00:08:56.62 --> 00:09:00.66 I'll all throughout the day so maybe what you need to do is do some more
00:09:01.34 --> 00:09:07.18 Cardiovascular at night or maybe it's just like a really good stretching routine because you got your strength
00:09:07.18 --> 00:09:13.02 And you got your cardio during the day like if I think about how much I sweat when I'm working on a house project
00:09:13.02 --> 00:09:17.50 I'm gonna full athletic sweat, so that means I'm working hard
00:09:18.38 --> 00:09:19.66 So
00:09:19.66 --> 00:09:25.82 Find what can you do that's gonna complement the the conditioning that you're getting from your actual labor and
00:09:26.14 --> 00:09:32.14 Maybe in your case it might just be like straight-up mobility it might be straight-up mobility like hey
00:09:32.14 --> 00:09:34.62 You're just doing some good stretching you're doing some mobility wand
00:09:35.50 --> 00:09:38.10 That's mobility work out of the day you can go to that website
00:09:38.10 --> 00:09:45.18 They got really good stuff on there to loosen up and make sure you're staying remember because the another thing you find with construction guys is
00:09:45.18 --> 00:09:50.38 They end up with some you know with a bad back with a bad they get you know
00:09:50.38 --> 00:09:55.20 Ten to night is from swinging a hammer all day or holding it so you can get those kind of use over-use injuries and
00:09:56.10 --> 00:10:00.80 Yeah, so I would look at what you can do that's gonna complement that also maybe you feel like
00:10:01.38 --> 00:10:05.22 You maybe you just need to do some heavy lifting because you're lifting something little all day
00:10:05.22 --> 00:10:09.18 You know you lift and dry all day so you get in some good endurance muscular endurance
00:10:09.34 --> 00:10:17.42 But maybe just come home and do do of couple sets of heavy deadlifts or couple sets of heavy squats and if the other thing here is like when we're on deployment
00:10:18.06 --> 00:10:21.30 When I was back in the when I was in the military when we were on deployment
00:10:22.22 --> 00:10:26.02 We wouldn't be doing workouts that are gonna give you
00:10:26.70 --> 00:10:31.26 The four days of blade on set muscular soreness right?
00:10:31.26 --> 00:10:38.36 You're not gonna put you in the pain locker where hey, I did squats yesterday. Oh echo just got shot
00:10:38.36 --> 00:10:40.46 I can't help him right do tired
00:10:40.74 --> 00:10:46.38 Do sore broken someone grab echo because my legs are super sore my gloves are hurting from front squats yesterday
00:10:46.38 --> 00:10:50.30 Yeah, so that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about doing some something that's heavy
00:10:50.30 --> 00:10:52.30 But it's quick and you're not you know
00:10:52.30 --> 00:10:57.82 You're not going crazy and doing so many sets that you're gonna build up all kind of lactic acid and make your legs all sore
00:10:57.82 --> 00:11:03.14 So maybe it's something that but I would say explore all that look what you can find that's gonna make you
00:11:03.30 --> 00:11:06.54 That's gonna compliment you what you do work and also you could look some jjitsu
00:11:07.10 --> 00:11:10.30 You know look at some jjitsu jjitsu although at first
00:11:11.06 --> 00:11:16.30 It's a crazy muscular workout a full body workout like you've never had before
00:11:16.30 --> 00:11:22.34 Yeah, because you're resisting every part of your movement and you'll be sore your entire body
00:11:22.34 --> 00:11:30.54 But then as you get better at it you can relax more that takes like a year or a half maybe even two years before you can really start to relax
00:11:30.66 --> 00:11:34.34 The thing that's cool about that for you is you got two kids under the age of four
00:11:34.34 --> 00:11:36.82 So maybe in two or three years they're ready to start training too now
00:11:36.82 --> 00:11:38.98 You got a little something to share with them little bit of jjitsu
00:11:39.14 --> 00:11:43.54 so yeah, don't kill yourself find something that compliments your work and
00:11:44.86 --> 00:11:51.58 If that's just stretching band just stretch yeah and maybe you don't know how you do it when I was a team two
00:11:51.58 --> 00:11:56.22 Team two we used to run all the time it was
00:11:56.94 --> 00:11:58.94 Every day it was like oh Monday
00:11:59.66 --> 00:12:01.66 PT in a run Tuesday
00:12:02.30 --> 00:12:07.42 Swimming around Wednesday obstacle course and the run on yeah Thursday
00:12:07.42 --> 00:12:10.06 I forget what it was and then Friday was a long run
00:12:10.06 --> 00:12:13.26 It was like a 12 mile run or 10 mile run on Fridays
00:12:13.82 --> 00:12:20.66 So what I would do is I would get done with work on Friday or get done with the PT on Friday and usually would be like half half day
00:12:20.66 --> 00:12:22.66 Frogman Friday
00:12:22.90 --> 00:12:27.34 Frogman Friday gets some pre-war no war going on guess what you're doing Friday afternoon in the dreams
00:12:28.34 --> 00:12:31.22 You're gonna go you know get after with your boys
00:12:32.66 --> 00:12:36.10 In the bar in the bar sure. Yeah frogman Friday frogman Friday
00:12:36.42 --> 00:12:39.98 The end frogman Friday kind of in a way once September 11th happened
00:12:39.98 --> 00:12:42.34 So this is pre-September 11th frogman Friday
00:12:42.34 --> 00:12:49.54 So we get done with work at you know noon and I would it's Friday go down and hit my squats and then so Friday
00:12:49.54 --> 00:12:53.30 I'd heal up Saturday and Sunday back to work on Sunday ready rock and roll
00:12:54.02 --> 00:12:56.74 So maybe you hit just do a good workout on Friday
00:12:57.54 --> 00:13:02.50 Yeah, good hard workout on Friday heal up over the weekend you're feeling good Monday back in the game
00:13:02.90 --> 00:13:04.90 Yeah hard labor
00:13:05.22 --> 00:13:07.78 Yeah requires something a little bit different yeah
00:13:08.26 --> 00:13:12.38 Then those of you that are sitting at a desk looking at a computer screen like echo Charles
00:13:14.18 --> 00:13:18.02 Yeah, you can do a different kind of workout when you do that all day for sure
00:13:18.02 --> 00:13:20.02 You mentioned the diet
00:13:20.02 --> 00:13:28.82 I would say with 99% certainty. I would say I don't know everybody right understand that 99% certainty that
00:13:30.50 --> 00:13:32.74 If you have a good diet not even of
00:13:33.62 --> 00:13:38.74 Immaculate that a good diet and you're working drywall construction moving as you know
00:13:38.74 --> 00:13:44.18 I used to be a mover for a little bit. Yeah, if you have a good diet that mean you watched moving
00:13:44.18 --> 00:13:46.18 Yeah
00:13:46.18 --> 00:13:52.98 Apparently you're mind that qualifies for you know just total victory. Yeah, I'm proud. Oh, it's anyway. Oh, yeah, I know you're an actual one
00:13:52.98 --> 00:13:58.90 Yeah, but get credit. I wasn't the best mover. I was one. I'm anyway. That's a that's a whole other thing anyway
00:13:59.54 --> 00:14:02.18 If you have a good diet and you're doing this kind of work
00:14:02.66 --> 00:14:08.82 That is your workout essentially and it's a long one. It's probably a hard to work out than most people's normal workout
00:14:08.82 --> 00:14:13.46 Yes, you do and that's the thing you're so right because when you're working eight ten hours a day
00:14:13.46 --> 00:14:15.86 There's a lot of work to be done. So your lunch break is like
00:14:16.42 --> 00:14:22.26 Dang this is I'm gonna go to get some delicious, you know to this food truck right here or this you know McDonald
00:14:22.26 --> 00:14:26.58 Well, wherever wherever. It's not you know you but you get a good diet with this kind of stuff
00:14:27.38 --> 00:14:33.30 You essentially have a great workout along with a good diet. You're gonna get results just that yeah
00:14:33.30 --> 00:14:39.62 And in a way you won't even really have to do these supplemental workouts unless you have different goals so if you're like
00:14:40.42 --> 00:14:45.50 Okay, I'm just gonna do my work. I'm gonna have a good diet and then I stretch afterwards, which is a such a good idea
00:14:45.50 --> 00:14:46.98 Yeah, yeah, I'm all day
00:14:46.98 --> 00:14:50.82 same motion all day stretch, you know get all that but you'll be way better
00:14:50.82 --> 00:14:54.66 You'll feel way better too. You'll be surprised how much how much easier the work becomes
00:14:54.66 --> 00:14:59.22 Yeah, and also maybe there's like I said you need to look for what compliments it
00:14:59.22 --> 00:15:05.14 Yeah, so with drywall. I don't I don't know you know, it's probably not dead lifting because you're left lifting stuff all day
00:15:05.14 --> 00:15:08.58 But maybe it's just like some hardcore like ab
00:15:09.38 --> 00:15:14.34 Core strength that you're gonna work. You're gonna you know and that's gonna strengthen your lower back
00:15:14.34 --> 00:15:19.62 It's gonna offset all the pressure that you put in your back all day. So maybe it's that maybe it's
00:15:20.90 --> 00:15:25.94 You know pull ups because you're not really pulling yourself up. Yeah, so so maybe you're doing two workouts
00:15:25.94 --> 00:15:29.70 Maybe you're doing like one workout on Fridays. You're doing abs and pull ups
00:15:30.82 --> 00:15:37.54 And then during the week you're doing a 20 minute stretch session yeah to really make sure your hips are opened up
00:15:38.74 --> 00:15:40.34 Right
00:15:40.34 --> 00:15:42.74 Like them guys from 10th plan as you're
00:15:42.74 --> 00:15:45.46 Yeah, yeah, they're flexible. They're flexible
00:15:45.94 --> 00:15:50.02 That's that you have to be you have to be able to do lotus to get your black belt from Eddie Bravo
00:15:50.02 --> 00:15:55.94 I can't do the lotus. I can't get my black belt from Eddie Bravo. No, no, no, you can't
00:15:56.58 --> 00:16:00.42 No, sorry bro. I should be able to do that at some point
00:16:00.42 --> 00:16:06.50 Deep depends on what you mean by should but yeah, man cool do the lotus and work on that and you know report back
00:16:06.98 --> 00:16:09.30 But yeah, the diet thing. I think the diet thing that's gonna be
00:16:09.78 --> 00:16:15.94 75 if not more percent people love you. You know, they say you don't sleep enough and how good? How do you not see?
00:16:15.94 --> 00:16:21.54 Don't eat crap. You don't need as much sleep. Yeah, check that out give that one a try
00:16:21.94 --> 00:16:27.54 Yeah, and listen, let's face it. There's people can be different with
00:16:28.02 --> 00:16:31.62 Yeah, requirements. You're a sister. You know like if I said hey, jocco
00:16:32.50 --> 00:16:38.58 You're imprisoned for I don't know whatever and you have eight hours of sleep. Yeah, no sleep for eight hours. We tried that
00:16:38.58 --> 00:16:43.86 I don't know if you can do that. I pull it on the ship multiple times free ship board deployments as a seal
00:16:43.86 --> 00:16:50.98 And when you're a seal on a ship you have no job. You know like the guys that are the guys that are in the regular Navy that are driving the ship and
00:16:51.46 --> 00:16:58.74 Maintaining the ship and steering the ship and all that they have a job. We have no job. Yeah, yeah, and so what we could either sleep
00:16:59.38 --> 00:17:04.74 Eat or lift and that's a waste to see you'll stood for sleep eat and lift
00:17:05.70 --> 00:17:07.14 But some guys
00:17:07.14 --> 00:17:12.42 Which sleep a lot? I wouldn't sleep a lot. We get some guys that had sleep disorders
00:17:12.42 --> 00:17:15.62 There was a guy that slept for like 29 hours
00:17:16.10 --> 00:17:18.02 But then you need to wake up and stay awake for
00:17:18.42 --> 00:17:22.10 32 hours and then he'd go back to bed for yeah, it was kind of weird
00:17:22.10 --> 00:17:28.98 Well, he's circadian rhythm was well. Yeah, and then that happens to want a ship because you can stay inside the ship with no son for
00:17:29.14 --> 00:17:30.50 Forever if you want to
00:17:30.50 --> 00:17:31.14 That's jamming
00:17:31.14 --> 00:17:34.34 We used to go out as much as we could on the deck of the ship. Yeah
00:17:35.22 --> 00:17:36.58 Get a son, 10
00:17:36.58 --> 00:17:38.58 No, do PT sure that too
00:17:38.58 --> 00:17:46.18 But yeah, I think you yeah, you sleep different and you know some eight hour and actually I've done this thing where
00:17:46.74 --> 00:17:51.70 I got used to only getting like six six and a half and it it started to work like I
00:17:51.70 --> 00:17:54.58 Sort of leave them you know, I didn't like that
00:17:55.86 --> 00:17:59.22 I tried to go back to actually I only get six maybe seven now anyway
00:17:59.78 --> 00:18:01.78 Because we kids think anyway
00:18:01.78 --> 00:18:07.54 The diet I think will I for real think I believe this yeah, we a fact something five percent or more
00:18:07.54 --> 00:18:11.62 Solution to the whole problem yeah the diet clean up the diet. He's good
00:18:12.02 --> 00:18:14.90 Bring your lunch. Yeah stay away from the Mickey D's
00:18:15.38 --> 00:18:17.38 Yeah, stay with me
00:18:17.38 --> 00:18:19.38 Don't but again, man, that's that is hard though
00:18:19.86 --> 00:18:24.58 Consider it yeah, yeah, yeah, it's hard due because you're tired. It's a cycle that you start going now
00:18:24.58 --> 00:18:27.94 Yeah, because you were tired when you got home so you didn't make any food for the net next day
00:18:27.94 --> 00:18:31.54 So that means you brought something crappy or you bought fast food and now you ate the fast food
00:18:31.54 --> 00:18:33.38 Which makes you feel bad which means you get home your tires
00:18:33.38 --> 00:18:36.10 Which means you don't make lunch for the next day which means you're on the best bad cycle
00:18:36.10 --> 00:18:39.86 Yeah, and that's not to mention the pleasure part of it because again this hard work
00:18:39.86 --> 00:18:42.82 I need some relief from this hard work work on my lunch break
00:18:43.14 --> 00:18:45.14 So it's like some dark chocolate
00:18:45.78 --> 00:18:48.58 Yeah, maybe right like bring some chocolate milk
00:18:49.30 --> 00:18:52.02 Yeah, take it taste good and it's good for you. Well
00:18:53.30 --> 00:19:01.14 Are you believe we'll say arguably it's not as bad for you as a mountain do yeah or a pizza by the slice from the
00:19:01.14 --> 00:19:05.62 Drop the food truck. Yeah, and that's usually what it is man take for me. I know
00:19:06.50 --> 00:19:09.90 All right, cool next question by the way that was one question. We're 20 minutes deep
00:19:09.94 --> 00:19:13.46 All right, man. We got to get to the bottom of these things. I think that'll help though
00:19:13.86 --> 00:19:17.06 I think so because look if you'd if let's say if you think oh yeah
00:19:17.30 --> 00:19:21.94 Maybe I'll change my diet, but you know what okay? I'll maybe I will maybe I won't I'll just kind of focus on the workout part of it
00:19:21.94 --> 00:19:23.22 Yeah, bro you
00:19:23.22 --> 00:19:24.34 You can go
00:19:24.34 --> 00:19:26.74 And one time I was like I didn't do any cardio
00:19:26.74 --> 00:19:31.46 I just kind of lifted and whatever my diet was not all that and sure I was I was being strong
00:19:31.46 --> 00:19:33.78 I went to the doctor. They said you're your cholesterol
00:19:33.78 --> 00:19:38.66 thing, you know some stuff on the inside. I was super unhealthy you was like you're unhealthy
00:19:38.90 --> 00:19:42.02 I'm all being in strong. I was like wait sir, but I can banch a lot
00:19:42.26 --> 00:19:50.50 I'm like pro that doesn't matter so you can hang drywall all day all day and dang that's some good endurance if you can do that all day every day for 14 years by the way
00:19:50.50 --> 00:19:55.70 And be like oh unhealthy because you ate wrong you don't jam you up that bad
00:19:56.90 --> 00:20:05.62 Clean up the diet. Yeah, good news clean up the diet next in the whole situation next question. How do you in stress? How do you install pride back into an
00:20:05.62 --> 00:20:07.86 Individual and ultimately a battalion?
00:20:09.06 --> 00:20:16.50 I'm on my 17th year serving in the British army. I've been in my role for about a decade and I'm about to move on to a different job
00:20:16.50 --> 00:20:25.94 Recently I've came out of my platoon bubble and notice there are numerous issues. I've identified and I'm looking to help my COC in fixing it
00:20:27.62 --> 00:20:31.62 All right, so you aren't still pride back into
00:20:32.50 --> 00:20:35.94 Battalion into a unit into an individual in my opinion
00:20:37.14 --> 00:20:39.14 Pride comes from hard work
00:20:40.02 --> 00:20:42.02 Pride comes from discipline
00:20:42.02 --> 00:20:46.74 Pride comes from performance and pride comes from
00:20:47.70 --> 00:20:52.18 winning and how do you win you win from
00:20:53.62 --> 00:21:03.30 Hard work you win from discipline. So that's the cycle you work hard you stay disciplined that makes you start to perform that makes you start to win
00:21:03.86 --> 00:21:06.50 When you start to win you get pride and
00:21:07.62 --> 00:21:10.82 Of course there's a dichotomy there too because you can work your guys too hard
00:21:10.82 --> 00:21:12.82 Right you can do that
00:21:12.74 --> 00:21:18.58 So you have to balance it then it's funny actually lay foot stalker about this. I think it I don't know if it was a we were with a company
00:21:19.30 --> 00:21:22.82 And he was saying when we formed up task unit bruiser
00:21:24.18 --> 00:21:26.18 We worked hard
00:21:26.34 --> 00:21:32.02 We worked a lot harder than normal task units worked we stayed later at work we came in earlier
00:21:33.30 --> 00:21:37.86 And you know he was saying hey when we first the first like month we were together and and
00:21:37.86 --> 00:21:44.66 Jockel's got everyone coming in early and all this stuff and people are grumbling about it and why do we got to do this extra stuff?
00:21:45.22 --> 00:21:53.22 And he's today's like others people are grumbling about but then once we started going through training in our performance was
00:21:54.58 --> 00:21:55.62 above
00:21:55.62 --> 00:21:57.14 our peers
00:21:57.14 --> 00:21:59.94 Then all of a sudden it turned from grumbling to like pride
00:22:01.22 --> 00:22:02.34 So
00:22:02.34 --> 00:22:06.34 That's then then the guys they stopped complaining and they start bragging
00:22:06.34 --> 00:22:10.18 Yeah, because you know what where to you bruise or you know of course you're not at work
00:22:10.82 --> 00:22:12.50 Because your your task unit is weak
00:22:13.22 --> 00:22:17.22 We are strong you are weak get away from us. We don't want to be associated with you
00:22:17.78 --> 00:22:20.34 So you start getting that which is you know pride
00:22:21.06 --> 00:22:25.78 So I think that's what you got to do you got to instill the hard work the discipline in your team
00:22:25.78 --> 00:22:28.98 It'll hurt a little bit at first you got to make sure you don't go overboard with it and
00:22:29.54 --> 00:22:32.58 That'll get you what you want if you need further
00:22:32.58 --> 00:22:35.78 References on that read a book called steal my soldier's heart
00:22:36.50 --> 00:22:37.86 by
00:22:37.86 --> 00:22:41.70 Colonel David Hacworth or read about face by Colonel David Hacworth
00:22:41.78 --> 00:22:47.94 He talks about this. This he takes the takes battalion his battalion Vietnam with no pride and turns them into
00:22:48.26 --> 00:22:50.26 People with a ton of pride. How does he do it?
00:22:50.58 --> 00:22:55.06 Makes more card. Makes him have discipline and then they take pride and what they're doing
00:22:55.06 --> 00:23:02.02 Lead by example. Yes, yes, and Hacworth
00:23:02.74 --> 00:23:05.94 He doesn't change everything at once. He doesn't come in and just go crazy
00:23:06.50 --> 00:23:11.78 He starts changing important small things couple of days. I think literally he says two a day
00:23:12.34 --> 00:23:14.34 To change two things a day
00:23:16.74 --> 00:23:18.74 But he did start off with a big thing
00:23:18.74 --> 00:23:24.34 If you remember this he checked in this battalion guys have radios guys have guitars guys have
00:23:24.98 --> 00:23:27.22 Little bars set up they got all this crap
00:23:27.38 --> 00:23:33.54 He was a everything that you can't fit in a rucksack tomorrow morning in the middle of the compound here and we're getting rid of it
00:23:34.74 --> 00:23:36.74 So that was a big wake-up call for everyone
00:23:36.90 --> 00:23:42.10 But it was a it was a wake-up call and also it was why are we doing this? What were doing this so that we can move
00:23:42.50 --> 00:23:46.18 When we move we won't get hit at night. We'll get hit at night. We won't lose anybody
00:23:47.14 --> 00:23:48.66 So
00:23:48.66 --> 00:23:50.66 Yeah, good stuff make sense
00:23:51.78 --> 00:23:53.78 Next one
00:23:54.82 --> 00:23:57.62 Sorry for the English I'm French that's a disclaimer
00:23:59.22 --> 00:24:05.30 How can a man that has not grown up with the confidence and trusting male role models and mentors
00:24:06.18 --> 00:24:11.78 Sort of anti uncle Jake persons only intellectual I'm saying this without disrespect to these people
00:24:11.78 --> 00:24:17.86 How can they become a confident man and develop the necessary man skills quote unquote?
00:24:19.46 --> 00:24:22.82 Okay, it's interesting you can say man skills in quotes
00:24:24.02 --> 00:24:29.22 And I think we pretty much know what that means right yes like we know what that means so so
00:24:30.74 --> 00:24:36.50 How do you do that you don't have any positive role model around you that's like an uncle Jake
00:24:36.50 --> 00:24:40.74 Which by the way most people don't have an uncle Jake. Yeah, that's not normal to have uncle Jake
00:24:42.10 --> 00:24:48.10 Most people you got what you got and in this case he's saying he's got likes the intellectuals so you know
00:24:48.66 --> 00:24:54.26 My parents were college professors and they don't have any of these skills and they sit around and talk about
00:24:54.90 --> 00:25:00.50 Philosophy right now I ended up I can talk about philosophy well but
00:25:00.50 --> 00:25:09.46 I can't fix my car or I can't defend myself in a combat scenario in the streets
00:25:10.02 --> 00:25:14.18 So what are you gonna do okay? This is real simple go do things go do things
00:25:14.82 --> 00:25:16.34 Lift start lifting weights
00:25:16.66 --> 00:25:18.82 Loading how to deadlift learn how to squat
00:25:20.02 --> 00:25:24.74 That's that's part about being a man right sure physically. Yeah physically strong
00:25:24.74 --> 00:25:31.62 Learning some jiu-jitsu I recommend that probably could have guessed that one yeah learning how to fight
00:25:32.34 --> 00:25:37.14 Learning how to defend yourself. I just got asked this the other day kid came up to me. He's like what should I do if
00:25:37.86 --> 00:25:43.06 I get intimidated by other people and I or I don't know how to react when people like get in my face
00:25:43.86 --> 00:25:46.82 And I said do you change your jiu-jitsu no start trying to jiu-jitsu
00:25:47.94 --> 00:25:52.18 But then what I'm gonna fight everyone no no no no you don't have to because you already know you can beat them up right now
00:25:52.18 --> 00:25:57.78 If they attack you yeah, you can beat them up but if they are just getting in your face and try to punk you
00:25:57.86 --> 00:26:04.18 And you look at them and go pay if you want to do this. Let's do this, but I don't care. I know you can come to my gym. I'll choke you out
00:26:05.46 --> 00:26:07.46 Train some jiu-jitsu
00:26:07.70 --> 00:26:09.70 So we got that one run
00:26:10.58 --> 00:26:12.10 hike
00:26:12.10 --> 00:26:14.10 Sprint climb
00:26:14.10 --> 00:26:16.10 Build things
00:26:16.10 --> 00:26:18.66 Start building things rewire things
00:26:18.66 --> 00:26:20.66 Do some plumbing
00:26:22.82 --> 00:26:24.82 These things are not
00:26:26.10 --> 00:26:32.90 They're they're not impossible to do now it's gonna take you longer right like I've rewired my parts my house
00:26:33.86 --> 00:26:38.74 I've replummed parts my house so don't all the plumbing in parts my house now if you watch a skilled
00:26:39.22 --> 00:26:42.82 Electrition do what I'm doing it would literally take him
00:26:42.82 --> 00:26:50.18 One eight of the time maybe one quarter of the time because or like the drywall or we were talking about early a good drywall or
00:26:50.58 --> 00:26:55.78 They are like masters a good electrician masters a good plumber their smooth
00:26:57.22 --> 00:27:03.62 Me it's gonna take a while sure so but but what I'm saying is it's not impossible. Yeah, it's not impossible to do
00:27:04.66 --> 00:27:07.22 And it'll take you more time, but you're learning how to do it and
00:27:08.18 --> 00:27:10.18 That gives you
00:27:10.18 --> 00:27:14.58 What does that give you it gives you this self-reliance right hey?
00:27:14.58 --> 00:27:15.94 I can fix my
00:27:15.94 --> 00:27:18.34 Electrical outlet if I need to
00:27:20.90 --> 00:27:27.62 So those are good things work on your car change your oil whatever do those things and and again those things like I
00:27:28.18 --> 00:27:30.18 So I took electricity
00:27:30.74 --> 00:27:36.66 Class in high school sure where we learned how to wire rooms and everything that what it's called electricity class
00:27:36.66 --> 00:27:44.42 I took electricity with Scotty was the teacher's name sure wait you call them Scotty everyone called him Scotty
00:27:44.42 --> 00:27:49.06 He was an older guy his name was Scotty we all call them Scotty so Scotty
00:27:49.62 --> 00:27:52.34 But we we learn how to wash wire houses and all that
00:27:53.06 --> 00:27:55.06 Well, I didn't remember any that
00:27:55.06 --> 00:27:57.06 When I was now
00:27:57.06 --> 00:28:02.18 20 years later or 15 years later. I'm rewiring my kitchen where I which I ripped out of my house
00:28:02.90 --> 00:28:05.70 Okay, so what did I do you know what I did went down to home depot
00:28:05.70 --> 00:28:07.70 I bought a book
00:28:07.70 --> 00:28:16.42 Called electrical wiring and I read through it and I had followed the directions same thing with plumbing yeah go down by a book
00:28:16.82 --> 00:28:18.82 Called how to do plumbing and
00:28:19.86 --> 00:28:22.50 You do it and it and the good thing about this stuff is
00:28:23.30 --> 00:28:29.38 It's very satisfying to do that kind of work. Yeah. It's very satisfying to do it and you can overengineer things
00:28:29.38 --> 00:28:33.22 You make things super solid in your own house super secure super
00:28:33.22 --> 00:28:37.06 Yeah, you can just kind of go the extra distance because it's your own your own house
00:28:37.70 --> 00:28:38.74 So that's cool
00:28:38.74 --> 00:28:42.90 So those are all physical things and some kind of knowledge things that you can start working on
00:28:43.70 --> 00:28:48.10 What the hardest thing to overcome here is like a level of embarrassment
00:28:48.82 --> 00:28:52.98 Yeah, right? How so like I don't know anything about wiring. Oh, yeah, yeah, you know
00:28:52.98 --> 00:28:57.62 I don't I'm embarrassed to say I don't know anything about wiring. Yeah, and so people don't want to say anything
00:28:57.62 --> 00:29:01.22 So they'd rather just say hey, what's getting electricity in here to figure this one out. Yeah, or hey
00:29:01.22 --> 00:29:03.46 I was good. Yeah, so they're to tune bearers
00:29:04.66 --> 00:29:10.34 But if you have time do you yourself yeah and don't be embarrassed about it?
00:29:10.34 --> 00:29:15.78 Like hey, I'm wondering why am I catching to have no idea what I'm doing. Give me this book. Yeah, what I need to get oh give me some tools
00:29:16.58 --> 00:29:18.58 It's good to have good tools yeah
00:29:20.02 --> 00:29:24.02 Also, so that's that's like I said those are things that you can do you know
00:29:25.30 --> 00:29:28.90 I'm gonna shoot you know, I'm gonna shoot that's a good good skill to have
00:29:28.90 --> 00:29:30.90 Also read
00:29:32.10 --> 00:29:34.10 right read
00:29:34.10 --> 00:29:40.34 About history read about survival read about the world read about
00:29:41.06 --> 00:29:43.06 human beings under Dress
00:29:43.62 --> 00:29:45.62 read
00:29:45.86 --> 00:29:47.86 Read books
00:29:48.26 --> 00:29:49.62 Good books
00:29:49.62 --> 00:29:51.30 About good stuff
00:29:51.30 --> 00:29:56.10 About challenges. It's and then just like Mark in way the warrior kid
00:29:56.10 --> 00:30:01.06 He doesn't know his time stables. Yes to learn them you have to go learn all this stuff. I'm talking you have to go learn
00:30:01.62 --> 00:30:04.90 and with with time your confidence is gonna grow
00:30:05.86 --> 00:30:06.58 and
00:30:06.58 --> 00:30:08.26 From humility
00:30:08.26 --> 00:30:12.34 You'll grow into being more confident now you also say you don't have any mentors
00:30:12.98 --> 00:30:19.54 Or role models around you. That's okay because those mental mentors and role models are in books and you can find them
00:30:19.78 --> 00:30:25.70 You can I just talk about David Hacker good mentor to have a mad and you can have a guy a guy wrote you a
00:30:25.70 --> 00:30:27.70 1000 page book
00:30:29.62 --> 00:30:31.86 One how to lead and it's for you
00:30:32.74 --> 00:30:34.74 That's pretty awesome
00:30:34.74 --> 00:30:40.18 Beyond band of brothers by Dick Winners. Mm-hmm guess what here's a guy
00:30:41.14 --> 00:30:43.62 That was the in charge of
00:30:45.30 --> 00:30:50.98 The band of brothers in Normandy and he wrote a book for you
00:30:50.98 --> 00:30:56.34 It's a learn how to lead so those are some examples and
00:30:57.46 --> 00:31:04.34 Like I said most the books that we've covered on this bar many of the books that we cover on this podcast and give you a mentor better than anyone could possibly hope for
00:31:05.54 --> 00:31:09.78 So you can get it there, but and and we mostly cover war books, but there's books about all kinds of
00:31:11.14 --> 00:31:13.14 People that can be virtual
00:31:13.78 --> 00:31:14.98 mentors
00:31:14.98 --> 00:31:16.18 so
00:31:16.18 --> 00:31:16.98 Read
00:31:16.98 --> 00:31:18.18 study
00:31:18.18 --> 00:31:18.98 do
00:31:18.98 --> 00:31:27.94 That's my advice on that one. Yeah, that physically strong thing is in my opinion a big deal because especially what with
00:31:28.98 --> 00:31:32.42 You know intellectual types and that kind of environment
00:31:33.38 --> 00:31:35.38 Since that's not really a priority a lot of the time
00:31:36.90 --> 00:31:40.50 Use ten to you know how like you're not into something so you kind of shun it as
00:31:40.50 --> 00:31:45.62 Yeah, you know like space and I've seen this I'm not saying all the time, but you know sometimes the
00:31:45.62 --> 00:31:50.90 In fact, I don't like takedowns so I'm not gonna do them and then you think of all the reasons why you don't need to do it
00:31:50.90 --> 00:31:55.30 Yeah, and how guys focus to you know or whatever so in intellectual circle
00:31:55.70 --> 00:31:57.54 We'll see yeah those circles sometimes
00:31:58.26 --> 00:32:03.30 You be like oh yeah those meatheads or whatever, you know, they just they'll shun it are you saying to do about that issue on
00:32:04.98 --> 00:32:07.70 No, yeah, no, no, I don't think so actually
00:32:08.34 --> 00:32:12.58 But they'll do that and then they'll be these physically frail people
00:32:12.58 --> 00:32:19.94 But since they they're in their mind smarter than everyone they feel like they have the one up in their kind of there's an element of satisfaction there
00:32:19.94 --> 00:32:21.94 Yeah, but
00:32:23.94 --> 00:32:25.94 At the end of the day you're physically weak
00:32:25.94 --> 00:32:31.70 Yeah, it comes down there and I think most of the time I think I don't know but it seems like most of the time
00:32:31.70 --> 00:32:35.22 No, have these feelings like this guy asked right here like yeah man
00:32:35.62 --> 00:32:40.42 How can I develop because I feel it yeah yeah, unless they just want to be in denial
00:32:40.42 --> 00:32:46.02 Right, that's what exactly and also and by the way the same thing happens in the reverse
00:32:46.42 --> 00:32:48.42 Right, oh guys that's just a meathead
00:32:48.42 --> 00:32:54.98 He shuns and and disrespect or disregard the intellectual side of things and
00:32:56.10 --> 00:33:00.66 That is this that is equally as bad because they're not they don't know what's going on
00:33:00.66 --> 00:33:04.34 They're not knowledgeable. They're not learning they don't understand the world in a clear way
00:33:04.34 --> 00:33:12.98 So find the balance between those two things yeah, and what's great is those things are not mutually exclusive like you don't have to just be a meathead
00:33:12.98 --> 00:33:19.22 Or just have to be a bookworm right you can do both there's plenty of time of the day to do both be a
00:33:20.26 --> 00:33:24.02 A smart ass guy with a big deadlift. That's a good thing
00:33:24.74 --> 00:33:26.74 I'm trying to be that guy
00:33:26.74 --> 00:33:32.58 Not there yet, but I'm working on it. Yeah, and then that one level up which is the juitsu part of it
00:33:32.58 --> 00:33:39.06 Did you just think too I think about you did you do combine the intellectual piece with the physical piece yeah in a way
00:33:39.06 --> 00:33:45.06 You can kind of I would I'm not recommending this at all in fact I'm against this, but this is the nature of juitsu
00:33:45.62 --> 00:33:50.10 You don't have to be that like you don't have to have a big deadlift to dominate in jujitsu
00:33:50.10 --> 00:33:53.94 You don't have to do any of that so you can essentially overcome the physical part of it
00:33:53.94 --> 00:33:58.10 Even though you just do physical, but it's like you don't have to you know overcommon physical part of it for it
00:33:58.10 --> 00:34:06.02 To appoint yeah, yeah in everyday life. I mean you you're trying to you're trying to be the guy like if someone's better than you had jujitsu
00:34:06.66 --> 00:34:08.82 Training room it really bothers you
00:34:08.82 --> 00:34:13.06 Are you talking about you everyone or you talking about me you jokka doesn't bother me well
00:34:13.54 --> 00:34:18.10 Let's say it motivate. I don't know you like it doesn't bother me right right right. I mean
00:34:18.82 --> 00:34:22.82 Like for instance, I train with Dean Lestrol with him. Yeah, he's better at me than jujitsu right
00:34:22.82 --> 00:34:28.90 I every day want to train with him right so it doesn't bother me. Yes, it's not bother but like what a no compels you
00:34:28.90 --> 00:34:32.74 Like compels me. Yeah, you know, but maybe it does like I hate it at the end
00:34:32.74 --> 00:34:35.70 The other deep-duck deep-duck deep-duck. He depends on what you mean, but rather it's all your
00:34:35.70 --> 00:34:40.34 I hate it. I do I hate it and I love it and we were just joking about the other day because we got into a little scrap yesterday
00:34:40.82 --> 00:34:48.10 You know kind of end-a-training and all of a sudden things got escalated and there was some shouting going on and
00:34:48.10 --> 00:34:53.94 Shouting shouting. Yeah, yeah, you know, he was saying what he says and I was saying what I say and
00:34:54.98 --> 00:35:00.50 But we had a you know, we had a mutual truth at the end. We I think he didn't really want new more
00:35:01.06 --> 00:35:03.22 I didn't really want new more so we just kind of
00:35:03.70 --> 00:35:05.70 Let's let's laugh and call it good
00:35:06.50 --> 00:35:12.82 Because you're you're rolling the dice when I'm all the dean. There's there's a dice roll happening because if he ends up in a good position on me
00:35:12.82 --> 00:35:17.22 There's gonna be pain. There's gonna be pain if I end up a good position on him
00:35:17.62 --> 00:35:19.62 There's gonna be pain so
00:35:20.10 --> 00:35:24.58 I think both of us we got away a little bit unscathed neither one of us got a really good position
00:35:25.46 --> 00:35:30.18 And we got back up to my feet and then we both kind of just had a mutual
00:35:30.98 --> 00:35:34.02 Agreement on unspoken agreement that we were done for the day
00:35:36.82 --> 00:35:40.82 That happened but the point there being is in almost like in this weird way
00:35:40.82 --> 00:35:46.66 You know how like intellectually you can excel so you can kind of find it justifiable to avoid the physical part of it
00:35:46.82 --> 00:35:51.14 It's almost like you could almost say the same thing about jiu-jitsu you could still be
00:35:51.62 --> 00:35:57.78 Effective in defend yourself without be physically strong necessarily, but but my point is that there's a limitation to that
00:35:58.10 --> 00:36:03.30 Yeah, you can be you can be you can be unbelievable at jiu-jitsu
00:36:03.94 --> 00:36:08.42 But if you're really really weak and you go against someone that's really good at jiu-jitsu
00:36:08.42 --> 00:36:13.14 But they're a hell of a lot stronger than you. Yeah, you're gonna have some issues. Right, yeah, and that goes for everything
00:36:13.14 --> 00:36:19.38 You gotta be both. Yeah, I do lean that's ultimately the main point is just like how intellectually you can be
00:36:19.62 --> 00:36:24.34 You know a black belt and you can sort in a way get away with not necessarily being
00:36:25.06 --> 00:36:30.74 And vice versa and then jiu-jitsu is like that third element you didn't sort of get away with not being super strong
00:36:30.74 --> 00:36:35.30 But still be effective in jiu-jitsu, you know, I mean so yeah, I do it just like some random in the middle
00:36:35.46 --> 00:36:36.74 Yeah, get get that balance
00:36:36.74 --> 00:36:41.46 I hear yourself but being able to defend yourself is a whole other thing than being physically strong
00:36:41.46 --> 00:36:48.74 At you know seems obvious, but when you go through life, I think it's not because you get these like big jack guys and it's like no one wants to mess with him
00:36:48.74 --> 00:36:49.78 Well
00:36:49.78 --> 00:36:57.06 Bro, this medium to small guy who knows jiu-jitsu or knows these you know for real fighting stuff is way more of a
00:36:57.70 --> 00:37:03.46 I don't want to say dangerous, but yeah, ultimately way more dangerous than this big jack guy who can lift a lot for sure
00:37:03.46 --> 00:37:10.18 So it's that third element that are kind of like weird when you're all of somebody that's super jacked and they don't know jiu-jitsu
00:37:10.18 --> 00:37:16.58 Yes, and it's amazing. It's it's it's it's like amazing. Yeah, you just think yourself how was this happening?
00:37:16.98 --> 00:37:21.30 Yeah, this is the magical power. Yeah, because you look at a big jack guy
00:37:22.10 --> 00:37:23.86 You're human instincts
00:37:24.82 --> 00:37:28.42 Tell you look out. Yeah, he's gonna that person is stronger than you
00:37:29.54 --> 00:37:31.54 You know watch out
00:37:31.54 --> 00:37:33.54 But when you know jiu-jitsu
00:37:33.54 --> 00:37:40.50 Yeah, you don't and eventually you realize you don't even have that anymore. Yeah, you know everyone you're looking at thinking
00:37:41.06 --> 00:37:45.22 Wait, you don't have well. Oh, you don't have that in that it's a fear. Yeah, I have that instinctive fear
00:37:45.70 --> 00:37:50.26 Although you're still you you know my first thought when I look at someone was like do they train or not?
00:37:50.26 --> 00:37:54.34 Yeah, do they train or not if they train? We we may have issues
00:37:55.06 --> 00:38:00.74 This could be a problem if they don't train no factor. Yeah, no train no factor. Yeah, if they train
00:38:00.74 --> 00:38:04.42 May have a factor. That's why I got to work out hard. So I'd be strong. Yeah
00:38:05.38 --> 00:38:11.30 Yeah, you know you know because they might be coming to take my lunch money. Maybe right? Don't want that. Oh, how's this?
00:38:12.26 --> 00:38:13.54 Last night
00:38:13.54 --> 00:38:17.06 Literally last night. I didn't see do you train last night. I did not train last night. Oh, oh
00:38:17.06 --> 00:38:18.50 This is where real world
00:38:18.50 --> 00:38:19.70 um experience
00:38:19.70 --> 00:38:24.54 So you know the five gallon jugs of water, you know those being you put in a water cooler
00:38:24.58 --> 00:38:29.14 Whatever, so there's like a little refilling thing that I went to. It was like nice talk the story before
00:38:29.14 --> 00:38:31.14 No, there's another this happened last night
00:38:31.54 --> 00:38:34.18 So hazardous duty. I know water refilling it
00:38:34.18 --> 00:38:39.38 But the jugs yeah, I bet okay. I mentioned I do that. Okay. So last night when I was doing now
00:38:39.38 --> 00:38:45.70 I was refilling the jugs um you know I go and storm coming out walking to my truck to get the empty jugs to go to the little thing
00:38:46.26 --> 00:38:50.98 As I'm walking to my truck a car pulls up right next to the water filling thing
00:38:51.86 --> 00:38:55.30 There's a what's called a red box, you know what that is a DB-red
00:38:55.30 --> 00:39:03.46 Yeah, so Carpool's up a kid maybe 12 years old jumps out of the car. He starts like it was a yoke to do it
00:39:03.46 --> 00:39:05.46 No normal kid whatever and
00:39:06.66 --> 00:39:10.02 From in the car this thing male probably is dead
00:39:10.50 --> 00:39:11.78 Some of
00:39:11.78 --> 00:39:13.78 Maybe stepdad really and
00:39:14.50 --> 00:39:16.82 Immediately the dad started yelling at him
00:39:18.18 --> 00:39:23.14 Just put it in the thing and just to the point where I thought he was kind of joking
00:39:23.14 --> 00:39:27.30 Where because all joking my daughter like that. Yeah, you kind of like how you'll do sometimes
00:39:27.30 --> 00:39:29.94 Yeah, you'll get it but and it sounded like a joke
00:39:30.66 --> 00:39:35.70 What I was like probably sky serious and the kid is like you could tell he was kind of used to it
00:39:35.70 --> 00:39:41.46 You know he was like I am I'm doing I'm trying you know whatever whatever and that kind of whole parking lot could hear yeah, and this at nighttime
00:39:42.58 --> 00:39:48.34 To give you a setting so I'm walking to my truck. I'm like bro if I get to this place and this guy's still there
00:39:48.34 --> 00:39:52.50 Not even yell-yams there. I'm gonna have to say something not be a dick not be like hey
00:39:52.50 --> 00:39:58.26 Don't talk to it like that. I'm gonna try to solve this problem. I'd be like hey this kid you know whatever I had this little thing
00:39:59.62 --> 00:40:02.66 Before I knew jiu jitsu or anything like that I wouldn't have messed with it
00:40:02.66 --> 00:40:06.58 I would have even been like bigger whatever and strong. I would have been like oh man
00:40:06.58 --> 00:40:08.58 That's all yeah
00:40:08.58 --> 00:40:14.10 Yeah, you know, but man. I was like man. I'm gonna do this like grabbed it and they they left so I didn't get the opportunity
00:40:14.10 --> 00:40:16.58 But I'm just saying these are things that
00:40:16.58 --> 00:40:23.14 Can happen on varying levels every day and if you're in intellectual that not I'm not saying if you're an intellectual
00:40:23.14 --> 00:40:29.78 But if you don't have these elements of whether be skill or yeah knowledge or whatever like those things mess with you
00:40:30.02 --> 00:40:30.98 You know
00:40:30.98 --> 00:40:37.70 Yeah, I mean I mean you get to and when I figured out what jiu jitsu was when master chief Steve Bailey choked me and he was
00:40:38.10 --> 00:40:41.62 He was a old man at the time probably three years younger than I am
00:40:41.62 --> 00:40:46.26 And I was thinking myself how this how this guy just do this to me that's insane
00:40:46.34 --> 00:40:48.82 That's completely insane. I need to learn whatever he knows
00:40:49.14 --> 00:40:52.02 Teach to me whatever you know because I don't want to feel that way ever
00:40:52.42 --> 00:40:57.38 Bro, and then you're training it like let's say you train for five years for five years you're training not
00:40:57.38 --> 00:41:00.66 It gets people who don't know you're training against people who do you know yeah
00:41:00.66 --> 00:41:05.54 Dangerous people who do know like how to defend your shit and then you go in the real world
00:41:05.54 --> 00:41:11.70 Yeah, you this guy has no idea how much control you have over and you didn't touch yeah
00:41:11.70 --> 00:41:13.30 I see yeah
00:41:13.30 --> 00:41:17.46 That's it's totally so yeah, this this whole thing where I mean you're and that you're
00:41:17.94 --> 00:41:23.14 Thing about some guy with the guy was his problem was like when people get in this face or whatever
00:41:23.46 --> 00:41:25.06 His problem wasn't getting beat up
00:41:25.06 --> 00:41:29.54 Everyone people getting your face and how you react and how you feel and stuff but that feeling gone
00:41:29.54 --> 00:41:34.74 Yeah, because you're right you're 100% right because he said he wasn't scared of fighting
00:41:35.38 --> 00:41:39.14 He was saying like I might get in trouble. He was he didn't like how we felt
00:41:39.14 --> 00:41:44.34 I felt like he should do something and he felt like a wimp basically when you know that you can destroy someone
00:41:44.90 --> 00:41:48.66 Then it doesn't matter you just think they're an idiot. Yeah, you beat them
00:41:49.38 --> 00:41:54.10 You get the strength and the skills and you actually beat them on an intellectual level
00:41:54.10 --> 00:41:58.74 So it's like a dead double gravitational effect on now
00:41:59.62 --> 00:42:02.82 All right, so yeah, yeah, if you can get those three in an intellectual
00:42:03.38 --> 00:42:08.10 Psychological whatever mental physical and skill-wise defending yourself
00:42:08.10 --> 00:42:11.14 That's a bit the three right there. It's good stuff
00:42:11.86 --> 00:42:18.74 Not just just how hard you want to hit it really you want to hit it already. I think so too. You know it's very beneficial to hit it hard
00:42:18.74 --> 00:42:22.34 Next question
00:42:24.90 --> 00:42:26.18 Choco
00:42:26.58 --> 00:42:28.58 Should someone always be detached?
00:42:29.46 --> 00:42:31.06 Okay straightforward question
00:42:31.46 --> 00:42:32.42 The answer is no
00:42:33.30 --> 00:42:38.34 Someone shouldn't always be detached because otherwise you aren't enjoying anything
00:42:40.66 --> 00:42:47.22 In your life so don't always be attached detached no but at the same time that being said
00:42:47.22 --> 00:42:49.22 You should be aware
00:42:50.10 --> 00:42:58.10 All the time if you are getting sucked into the emotional vortex right you've got to be aware of that
00:42:58.34 --> 00:43:01.06 Once you have that awareness you don't need to be attached all the time at all
00:43:01.94 --> 00:43:03.94 You can I'm not always detached
00:43:04.74 --> 00:43:06.74 at all but
00:43:06.74 --> 00:43:12.90 but I've got clear warning signs when things start going sideways
00:43:12.90 --> 00:43:17.78 And I start going down some vortex. I know immediately and I just detached
00:43:18.42 --> 00:43:25.06 So it's really easy it's but it does take practice and eventually realize that you know when you're feeling overwhelmed
00:43:25.06 --> 00:43:28.34 When you're feeling emotional and you're feeling angry you're feeling frustrated
00:43:29.22 --> 00:43:32.98 When you start feeling those things and you've sent some really quickly and you recognize them
00:43:33.86 --> 00:43:35.86 You just detach boom you're done
00:43:36.10 --> 00:43:41.22 Yeah, so that's what you got to do start recognizing those red flags so that you can enjoy the good things
00:43:41.22 --> 00:43:44.58 And when something starts getting crazy you can detach
00:43:45.14 --> 00:43:48.98 Yes, it's like an overall skill of being able to control
00:43:49.62 --> 00:43:53.78 When to detach and when you don't have to being able to identify
00:43:55.38 --> 00:43:58.50 When you need to detach then being able to detach
00:43:59.46 --> 00:44:04.50 Then you're good. Yeah, so it's like a matter of being capable of making an accurate
00:44:04.50 --> 00:44:12.10 Beneficial choice yeah, but the identification is the hard part. Yes people what happens to people when they talk to me is they go
00:44:12.10 --> 00:44:16.10 They after the fact they realized I lost my temper and I did this yeah, okay
00:44:16.18 --> 00:44:19.14 You didn't detach any time and that's why you ended up there
00:44:19.70 --> 00:44:25.70 So or I said some things to my you know my ex girlfriend that I shouldn't have said because I got too emotional
00:44:25.86 --> 00:44:28.10 Exactly you didn't detach in time
00:44:28.50 --> 00:44:30.18 You got crazy and emotional
00:44:30.18 --> 00:44:35.94 So the skill that you're missing is identifying when you're starting to get too emotional whatever that emotion might be
00:44:36.34 --> 00:44:40.66 Once you identify boom detach yeah, it's kind of like control then you can take control
00:44:40.82 --> 00:44:42.50 Yes, and make
00:44:42.50 --> 00:44:47.78 Tactical moves yeah, not emotional moves. That's ultimately the art, you know to make the move
00:44:47.78 --> 00:44:51.62 You know how like you do you two guys if they never take it? I say no, you know what the moves
00:44:52.18 --> 00:44:56.50 When you're emotionally detached the moves actually aren't that hard. They're actually usually pretty obvious
00:44:56.50 --> 00:45:00.34 Yeah, like you're you're in a fight with your girlfriend and
00:45:01.30 --> 00:45:04.66 And you're starting to go down the wrong lane as soon as you detach you go
00:45:04.66 --> 00:45:05.86 I know what I need to do
00:45:05.86 --> 00:45:10.58 Yeah, I should say I'm sorry and tell her that we can go the restaurant that you want to go to or whatever you know
00:45:10.58 --> 00:45:13.14 To me you know the moves are not actually that hard
00:45:13.14 --> 00:45:15.70 But we never make good moves when we're being emotional right instead
00:45:15.70 --> 00:45:18.02 We just go no, I don't want to go that restaurant. We went there three weeks through
00:45:18.02 --> 00:45:21.78 I don't care if I'd said that to you you deserve me to say that to you. Yeah. Yeah
00:45:22.58 --> 00:45:24.50 Yeah, that you go down the wrong path
00:45:24.50 --> 00:45:30.58 But what if somebody's like detached the whole time even when problems don't right? You know like that then we don't have a relationship
00:45:30.58 --> 00:45:32.58 Right, that's what I mean. That's a problem. That's what I'm saying
00:45:32.58 --> 00:45:36.26 So this is an opinion to that fault all the time. That's what that's the answer to the question right?
00:45:36.26 --> 00:45:38.58 So it's like you've reiterated it for everyone
00:45:38.82 --> 00:45:41.14 Yeah, man, that's what I'm doing for I think a lot of times
00:45:41.38 --> 00:45:45.46 You know, guys, I'll ask you hey, I want to learn you get to I want to learn to mess people up
00:45:45.46 --> 00:45:49.94 I think bro, that's not really what it is. Do you get to is having the skills to
00:45:49.94 --> 00:45:56.02 You know, quote unquote mess people up, but what you learn ultimately is you put yourself in a position
00:45:56.34 --> 00:46:01.06 Where you can make that decision is in time to mess them on up or not, you know, and you just have to control these
00:46:01.06 --> 00:46:07.62 Resurgeats. So that's really what most people that start with the vision of I want to build a mess people up most people
00:46:08.42 --> 00:46:15.22 Continued that that do continue on the journey of Jiu Jitsu arrive at a point where they realize that they don't want to abuse this power that they have
00:46:15.22 --> 00:46:21.38 Yeah, most people yeah, there's a small percentage of people that don't that are bullies yeah bullies when they started they become
00:46:21.94 --> 00:46:25.94 more effective bullies yeah more fearful more fear in
00:46:27.06 --> 00:46:29.86 Posing bullies yeah, which sucks
00:46:30.74 --> 00:46:37.94 But Jiu Jitsu is powered that's where you gotta have some of it. Yeah agree compare it to like a I don't know anything where it's like striking based or whatever
00:46:38.18 --> 00:46:44.74 It's like you it like I've said this for I'm not gonna go deep in it, but you go from zero to ten when you throw a strike
00:46:44.74 --> 00:46:48.50 That's already a 10. You know you can't just throw a light one and be like okay, are we?
00:46:48.50 --> 00:46:52.34 No, you know kind of thing because they're not cool. No, you just slap me in the face. We're gonna cool it all
00:46:52.34 --> 00:47:02.02 You brought it to 10. Yeah, yeah, it's funny because like I see I see my kids and and what you're talking about can happen very easily
00:47:02.58 --> 00:47:07.14 When other people are in the group with my kids. I mean because they've been training jiu jitsu
00:47:07.78 --> 00:47:09.78 so even
00:47:09.78 --> 00:47:11.78 like against any normal kid
00:47:11.78 --> 00:47:17.94 There's no factor yeah, like I see me doing my son will be wrestling around with some kid. It's no factor yeah
00:47:18.42 --> 00:47:23.86 and it's you know, it's kind of cool yeah, it's real cool. Yeah, I see little you know
00:47:24.42 --> 00:47:29.54 My kids aren't like jitsu like there's kids out there that are sick competitive jiu jitsu all the time right
00:47:31.14 --> 00:47:38.58 That's not what I'm talking about like just knowing jiu jitsu 100% correct. Yes, and but when I see kids doing jiu jitsu
00:47:38.58 --> 00:47:43.62 especially like I'm not saying in necessarily even in a tournament. I'm just saying in jiu jitsu in class
00:47:43.62 --> 00:47:46.18 I'm gonna have to beat her whatever when I see a problem like man
00:47:46.90 --> 00:47:53.30 I wish I could have done jiu jitsu. You know I'll find that would be yeah, man. Yeah, let's make up for it now
00:47:54.02 --> 00:47:55.22 I'm trying
00:47:55.22 --> 00:47:56.74 next question
00:47:56.74 --> 00:47:59.70 Jockel I've been offered a job as a deputy sheriff
00:47:59.94 --> 00:48:05.70 a few months before the position is actually open. I really want slash need to get into some jiu jitsu
00:48:05.70 --> 00:48:10.74 Do to the nature of the job close to place to me is over an hour drive away
00:48:12.02 --> 00:48:18.50 Yeah, hard hard show finances are an issue when it comes to that kind of drive plus fees to attend my main question is
00:48:19.14 --> 00:48:22.42 How do you feel about graces online school that's an option
00:48:23.46 --> 00:48:27.06 If I were to find others who want to learn would this be effective?
00:48:27.06 --> 00:48:34.98 Uh, yes, so here's what you need to do get some mats you can make mats
00:48:35.54 --> 00:48:43.22 You can get you can get a piece of canvas from home depot or piece of vinyl and string it between trees on the ground
00:48:43.94 --> 00:48:48.26 You just have mats you just made them all over grass that works. I've done it
00:48:48.26 --> 00:48:56.58 I've trained on with there's a truck called a six by in the military it's a big giant like a truck
00:48:57.30 --> 00:49:02.02 And it has you've seen this in like your typical warm movie the truck with the canvas tarp over the back
00:49:02.02 --> 00:49:05.30 Yeah, I've taken that thing off and that was my mat
00:49:06.10 --> 00:49:10.90 On top of the truck no, no, no taking it off the top of the truck you took the canvas on put it on the ground
00:49:11.30 --> 00:49:15.30 Guess what I got now? Do you jitsu mat strong put it with stakes in the ground?
00:49:15.30 --> 00:49:19.14 We're good to go to canvas, but it's good to go so you do that
00:49:19.94 --> 00:49:24.74 Then you get on YouTube you don't YouTube. You know graces you Academy
00:49:25.70 --> 00:49:33.06 Marcelo Garcia online those are really good. I would actually start with YouTube just like get some basics down get some fundamentals get you need two three four friends
00:49:34.18 --> 00:49:39.22 If you got a friend that wrestled get him in there. Oh, yeah, if you got a friend that did judo get him in there
00:49:39.22 --> 00:49:46.74 And then you just start looking at the moves and fighting each other and trying to see what works and don't go nuts on each other
00:49:46.74 --> 00:49:50.74 Trying to figure out what works. What doesn't work learn the basic concepts and then
00:49:52.26 --> 00:49:58.74 Maybe Saturdays maybe every other Saturday maybe one Saturday a month you drive an hour to this school with your buddies
00:49:58.74 --> 00:50:04.02 You go in there you say hey man, we live up and wherever an hour away from here if we give you 10 bucks
00:50:04.02 --> 00:50:09.86 We get on the mat, you know this weekend. Yeah, just for just for a couple hours. Can you can you look at what we're doing?
00:50:10.02 --> 00:50:12.42 Maybe even say hey look in the four of us get a private
00:50:12.90 --> 00:50:16.10 Will all give you 20 bucks that's 80 bucks you can make an hour coach, please
00:50:17.06 --> 00:50:22.26 So then you get some detailed training and that's gonna give you a base, you know that's I think you're best option
00:50:22.58 --> 00:50:25.58 Yeah, fully and these online
00:50:26.98 --> 00:50:30.58 You know academies and stuff that's essentially what they're made for if you can't
00:50:30.58 --> 00:50:35.30 Yeah, that's exactly how to make you can make it to academy you go to the academy. Yeah, where that academy is yeah
00:50:36.02 --> 00:50:38.34 Yeah, and I think podcast number six
00:50:39.06 --> 00:50:41.94 We talk about what to look for an edge of your academy
00:50:42.26 --> 00:50:47.62 So go back to podcast number six if you're starting to get to and you want to find a good academy go back to podcast number six
00:50:48.34 --> 00:50:52.72 It's in there. Yeah, fully and I think to start a special if you don't know
00:50:52.72 --> 00:50:57.82 You did to it all I think a lot of a started you did to with watching you have see one two three four
00:50:57.82 --> 00:51:01.02 You know, so we kind of after watching that we kind of see okay
00:51:02.02 --> 00:51:07.54 I see if you're mount if you have mount that's good. Yeah, if you're on the bottom guard if you're you know
00:51:07.54 --> 00:51:12.46 See you got a pick up. I didn't I knew what Jesus who was so I didn't get to experience
00:51:12.66 --> 00:51:17.18 Trying to learn the basic moves from seeing on a UFC so I'm taking what you're telling me
00:51:17.98 --> 00:51:18.54 as
00:51:18.54 --> 00:51:23.94 Factual and it makes some sense, but so did you actually like compute?
00:51:23.94 --> 00:51:29.02 The the positions you were like okay, that's the guards you must have watched in detail
00:51:29.02 --> 00:51:34.24 Well, you must have watched Rima but like okay that guy always crazy that guy that's wearing that white thing that white uniform
00:51:34.32 --> 00:51:37.26 Look what he's doing. He's got his legs closed around like that's what you guys were doing
00:51:37.26 --> 00:51:40.94 Essentially, but because even the announcers weren't calling it guard back then where are they?
00:51:40.94 --> 00:51:46.40 Oh, yes, there is a guy who's real nerdy guy and he was that was you see two I want to say
00:51:46.40 --> 00:51:51.30 Maybe even what I forget which one was which, but yeah, he knew and you could tell he was like kind of prideful
00:51:51.30 --> 00:51:56.58 That he would train with oriental whatever, but he got so you know, he's gonna pull him in between his guard like that's
00:51:57.78 --> 00:52:01.82 Yeah, but he knew and he'll okay. He's going to mount and it was real repetitive because he did the same thing
00:52:01.82 --> 00:52:04.94 So yeah, you you essentially if you're gonna teach him you learn guard
00:52:05.46 --> 00:52:09.90 You don't learn how to do in armor how to you know well when I teach kids sometimes
00:52:09.90 --> 00:52:13.76 I'll just say you want for like let's say a kid's been training for a day
00:52:13.76 --> 00:52:17.78 So first day you want to keep your legs around them right? Yeah, that's guard
00:52:17.78 --> 00:52:23.36 They don't even know what they're doing and then you say the other kid you want to get away from there or get around their legs
00:52:23.36 --> 00:52:27.02 Yeah, and so they just try and do it and that's a pretty cool way to start things off
00:52:27.02 --> 00:52:34.06 Very surprised at what kids will instinctively do to make things happen there. Yeah, and you even at the monster
00:52:34.06 --> 00:52:36.90 You know how you explain it just real quick like you're okay
00:52:36.90 --> 00:52:39.88 This is why it's important this is guard this one's important that's really
00:52:40.74 --> 00:52:44.68 Like the other day at there was a new girl in there or name Sarah
00:52:44.68 --> 00:52:48.48 I remember that because you know I know someone else named Sarah, but anyway
00:52:49.72 --> 00:52:52.52 At him it was time to roll round to you say hey there
00:52:52.52 --> 00:52:54.76 Adam was like hey, you know, there's some new people here
00:52:55.40 --> 00:52:58.04 No day zero days whatever
00:52:59.12 --> 00:53:03.32 Experience can you don't know teach or something you know as the rounds are going on because I didn't have a partner
00:53:03.32 --> 00:53:09.12 I didn't have came in late whatever, but so I went and I did essentially that just a crash course
00:53:09.12 --> 00:53:11.12 This is Mount this is guard this is
00:53:11.12 --> 00:53:13.12 Uh
00:53:13.12 --> 00:53:19.08 Side mouth, you know, and this is the importance of each one and then this is literally takes five minutes
00:53:19.92 --> 00:53:22.80 So I'm here's the importance of everyone and then I do a little quiz at the end
00:53:22.80 --> 00:53:26.80 I said okay boom boom we fight it's like a half speed we fight boom we fall to the ground
00:53:26.80 --> 00:53:31.000 What do you want to be and you know, so it's like a little quiz and boom right there that five minutes
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.82 You learn everything that I learned from watching you have seen one two three
00:53:34.82 --> 00:53:38.48 But in the more study and you are studying them and you are trying to figure it out
00:53:38.48 --> 00:53:43.70 But yeah, you can learn it in five minutes from somebody to own it to you exactly right if that's what they're teaching you a lot of times people
00:53:43.70 --> 00:53:47.20 Go in on their first day and some some academies if they're dope
00:53:47.20 --> 00:53:51.06 They'll have an introductory class class which is kind of that it's called an introductory class
00:53:51.06 --> 00:53:54.68 But if you're like hey, then my first day let me see what I can learn then they'll learn like some
00:53:55.28 --> 00:53:58.28 You know, almost plot there something and they're like way whoa
00:53:58.28 --> 00:54:03.84 I don't know how this even makes sense to to me, you know, but if you learn that crash course or you know
00:54:03.84 --> 00:54:08.06 Even got in the mustard that's why it's so cool you you go over that and I was like dang this is cool
00:54:08.06 --> 00:54:10.82 You can leave that and now your way better off
00:54:10.82 --> 00:54:14.02 It's funny and the mustard is everyone has heard us talk about your jitsu
00:54:14.42 --> 00:54:22.04 So they have this anticipation of it being really cool and then when they connect the dots between like okay
00:54:22.30 --> 00:54:28.70 You learn the mount and then you learn the guard and then you learn the sit-up sweep and when you done with the sit-up sweep
00:54:28.70 --> 00:54:30.70 You're from the guard you're back in the mount
00:54:31.02 --> 00:54:33.02 That people like it's a miracle
00:54:33.02 --> 00:54:35.02 Yeah, it's a miracle
00:54:35.02 --> 00:54:41.82 Man, it's just the magic and it's essentially before the actual moves like doing the moves
00:54:41.82 --> 00:54:46.38 It's just you have to know what's important. What's not like if you mount on someone just by having sense
00:54:46.38 --> 00:54:50.14 You don't know what mount is or the importance of how but if you wind up on the mount you're trying to punch the guy
00:54:50.14 --> 00:54:53.34 I'm saying in the fight you're trying to punch the guy and try to do damage trying to win the fight
00:54:53.58 --> 00:54:58.98 But punching the guy is not what you should be focused on primarily it should be keeping the mountain
00:54:58.98 --> 00:55:04.36 The position yeah exactly right, but no one's gonna automatically know that's not you know you're trying to beat up the guy on my back and punch him
00:55:04.36 --> 00:55:07.66 Let me punch him but no, it's just one other many examples
00:55:09.50 --> 00:55:11.50 Next question
00:55:12.30 --> 00:55:15.82 Jocco my boss is incredibly
00:55:17.22 --> 00:55:21.02 controlling an eagle maniacor I would like him already
00:55:22.30 --> 00:55:24.30 Eagle mania come right
00:55:24.30 --> 00:55:30.42 Just I have I have attempted to use extreme ownership in dealing with the people under me
00:55:30.42 --> 00:55:32.90 But my boss has reprimanded me for leading
00:55:33.46 --> 00:55:41.34 He has said he gets he gets to do all the leading because he's the one in charge quote on quote and and his job title is higher than mine
00:55:42.10 --> 00:55:49.02 I bet that happened it may be for by the way if I could continue to try to lead my responsibilities will be taken away
00:55:49.02 --> 00:55:54.38 If I step back into the shadows, I won't make an impact on the people under me what should I do?
00:55:54.58 --> 00:55:59.26 So it's black and white yeah, right in his mind seems like you can either
00:56:00.50 --> 00:56:02.50 Step up and lead and get fired or
00:56:03.46 --> 00:56:05.06 Step in the shadows and do nothing
00:56:05.06 --> 00:56:05.58 Never
00:56:06.22 --> 00:56:07.72 suffer
00:56:07.72 --> 00:56:13.18 It's not it's not that way right. It's not it's not black and white and actually start by putting your own ego in check
00:56:13.18 --> 00:56:18.94 Because you're calling someone to ego maniacal but your your ego is being
00:56:19.98 --> 00:56:26.02 Being touched a little bit here. Yeah, I rub the wrong way a little bit because you want to lead and we get told don't lead
00:56:26.02 --> 00:56:28.02 You get in a fence you guess what that is
00:56:28.94 --> 00:56:30.94 That's your ego so
00:56:31.22 --> 00:56:33.22 What you need to do is
00:56:33.58 --> 00:56:36.86 Maybe you like the you like the feeling of being in charge
00:56:37.22 --> 00:56:41.50 That's cool. I like the feeling of being charged. Yeah, it feels good to me. It feels normal to me
00:56:41.50 --> 00:56:45.70 When I'm not in charge, I don't like it. I have to consciously suppress it
00:56:45.70 --> 00:56:52.98 Which is fine sometimes you have to do that like right in this situation here that this guy's talking about and what you need to suppress is
00:56:53.50 --> 00:56:55.50 You need to
00:56:55.98 --> 00:56:58.50 Not be so over with your leadership
00:56:59.10 --> 00:57:03.66 He shouldn't even be able to sense that you're leading but you should be leading you got to be
00:57:04.94 --> 00:57:10.18 Under the radar you got to be covert with what you're doing and by the while you're doing that your massage and homeboys ego
00:57:10.18 --> 00:57:14.26 Make him feel good about it. Making him feel not he is running things
00:57:15.46 --> 00:57:20.86 And because because you can absolutely lead from the shadows
00:57:21.58 --> 00:57:27.90 If your ego allows it because a lot of times when we want when we lead we want everyone to know that we're leading
00:57:27.90 --> 00:57:29.78 I want everyone to know that I'm in charge
00:57:29.78 --> 00:57:32.78 I want them to know that I'm the man right?
00:57:33.10 --> 00:57:39.10 That's really hard when you're leading from the shadows a lot of times not even the people that you're leading
00:57:39.10 --> 00:57:41.10 Recognize
00:57:41.90 --> 00:57:45.74 overtly that you're leading think about that so the people that are actually
00:57:46.54 --> 00:57:48.54 Following you don't even know that they're following you
00:57:49.14 --> 00:57:51.10 They don't they don't consciously know it
00:57:51.42 --> 00:57:55.90 Maybe if they were to break down and you give them like a hey, who do you think is actually giving you and truck?
00:57:55.90 --> 00:58:01.58 They think well, I think that might be probably that seems like a deco. Okay, okay, but they don't like consciously think about it
00:58:02.82 --> 00:58:05.10 So that's what you need to do you need to
00:58:05.10 --> 00:58:11.06 Suppress your over leadership not step on the bosses toes massages lead
00:58:11.06 --> 00:58:15.66 Massages ego a little bit because if you do get your response you want to help right?
00:58:15.66 --> 00:58:18.38 You want to be helpful you want to lead these people in a great way
00:58:18.86 --> 00:58:22.14 If you don't if you get your responsibility taken away or you get fired
00:58:22.46 --> 00:58:25.38 Then you can't help anyone anybody you're not gonna help the team at all
00:58:25.38 --> 00:58:31.94 So you have to be smart and you have to play the game to win his confidence and his trust
00:58:31.94 --> 00:58:37.62 So he does let you lead and what's gonna do that when he realizes that you're gonna not gonna step on his toes
00:58:37.62 --> 00:58:42.18 That you're gonna give him the credit because he wants the credit he's an ego maniac, right? He's controlling
00:58:43.14 --> 00:58:44.50 so
00:58:44.50 --> 00:58:46.50 That's
00:58:46.66 --> 00:58:54.46 Kind of what you need to do now. This is the weird thing and this came up with the mustard people don't want to hear me say that
00:58:55.66 --> 00:59:00.54 People don't want to hear me say that people don't want to hear me say that if I come up against a boss
00:59:00.54 --> 00:59:05.90 The big ego what you need to do is back down people don't want to hear me say that
00:59:06.54 --> 00:59:12.58 They say want to hear me say if you come up against someone with a big ego what you do is you
00:59:12.58 --> 00:59:19.02 Bo up to and you show them that they ain't got nothing on you. Yeah, don't back down to that guy with a big ego
00:59:19.02 --> 00:59:20.02 That's weak
00:59:20.02 --> 00:59:21.02 You
00:59:21.02 --> 00:59:24.72 And when I said it the monster I said I said listen because I could see it
00:59:25.42 --> 00:59:27.02 I could see it people are like oh
00:59:27.02 --> 00:59:32.34 You know, I guess joccal is always hard corners. I thought he was because he's gonna back down to somebody with a big ego
00:59:32.34 --> 00:59:36.22 You know and I said guess what people this is why you feel that way
00:59:37.74 --> 00:59:41.50 If there was a machine gun nest on a hill and
00:59:42.30 --> 00:59:45.90 There was a bad guy in there and he's killing a bunch of people shooting that machine gun
00:59:46.54 --> 00:59:54.82 And everyone in the room wants to look at jaco and say jaco's brave and jacgos tough and jacgos gonna charge that machine gun nest
00:59:54.82 --> 00:59:56.82 I take that guy out
00:59:58.22 --> 00:59:59.58 Well guess what a
01:00:00.58 --> 01:00:05.46 Machine gun belt fed weapon in an elevated position bunkered in
01:00:06.10 --> 01:00:08.58 I'm not gonna take that guy out. I can't
01:00:09.58 --> 01:00:12.74 It's a heavily defended position. I can't do that
01:00:13.06 --> 01:00:18.02 So what jacco does is back down I hide
01:00:18.02 --> 01:00:21.02 I get behind cover so I don't die
01:00:21.02 --> 01:00:26.70 Once I've gotten behind cover so I don't die. I look at echo and I say echo
01:00:27.38 --> 01:00:30.94 Stay here shoot some rounds at this guy occasionally distract him
01:00:31.98 --> 01:00:33.98 I'm gonna flank him
01:00:34.30 --> 01:00:37.10 So that goes gonna keep under cover himself
01:00:37.10 --> 01:00:40.54 He's gonna play him some rounds up at the machine gun nest while he's doing that
01:00:40.54 --> 01:00:43.98 I'm gonna screw you away like a little baby like a little sneaky little squirrel
01:00:43.98 --> 01:00:49.02 Yeah, and I'm gonna go around to the flank because the machine gun is in a bunker, right?
01:00:49.02 --> 01:00:53.02 So we can't see out the sides. I'm coming up the side
01:00:54.06 --> 01:00:58.62 I'm gonna get right up the side my toss grenade in there and kill him. I'm gonna take out the ego
01:00:59.10 --> 01:01:01.10 But I didn't do it going head on
01:01:02.46 --> 01:01:08.26 So what happens is people come and up up against this big ego and they want to be the hero
01:01:08.26 --> 01:01:11.46 And they want to be aggressive and they want to the default aggressive jaco
01:01:11.46 --> 01:01:17.10 You say b-d you you you got a chapter in your book default aggressive man. I'm gonna be default aggressive against that ego
01:01:17.10 --> 01:01:19.10 wrong answer
01:01:19.82 --> 01:01:24.94 The right answers indirect warfare the right answers maneuver warfare the right answers you flank these people
01:01:25.58 --> 01:01:31.02 And by the way if I do charge that machine gun nest or I do attack that guy's ego guess what?
01:01:31.02 --> 01:01:33.26 I die or I get fired and now I'm no good anybody
01:01:34.14 --> 01:01:36.14 so it's
01:01:36.14 --> 01:01:38.14 People have this this desire
01:01:39.26 --> 01:01:43.82 To be the strong hero and you have to fight that that's your ego
01:01:43.82 --> 01:01:50.06 That's my ego charge in the machine gun nest. I'm gonna go do this on the man. No, I'm actually not the man
01:01:50.06 --> 01:01:53.50 It's a machine gun no good position. I'm gonna die. Yeah, you have to be smart
01:01:54.70 --> 01:02:00.46 Yeah, like on the attack that you go head on don't attack the heavily defended positions head on period
01:02:01.02 --> 01:02:03.66 Like you said in training day you're watching moving
01:02:03.82 --> 01:02:09.70 Training day no come on, bro. You watched it anyway. He says the shit is chest not checkers
01:02:09.70 --> 01:02:15.46 He's not the first person that ever said but it was don't when he said it in my opinion
01:02:16.10 --> 01:02:18.66 Nonetheless, yeah, so default aggressive isn't
01:02:19.30 --> 01:02:24.66 Default aggressive head to head. It's default of a default aggressive in being effective. Yes
01:02:25.38 --> 01:02:29.22 That is really effective for ineffective that's another master. I'd be in
01:02:29.22 --> 01:02:30.58 No, listen
01:02:30.58 --> 01:02:32.58 Life knows what he's talking about like that
01:02:32.58 --> 01:02:34.58 Yeah, man. Good
01:02:36.58 --> 01:02:37.58 Joko
01:02:37.58 --> 01:02:44.42 This next question. Yes, okay. How do you shift your mindset from individual contributor to manager
01:02:44.90 --> 01:02:49.86 Growing a company from nothing to something required being an individual contributor in getting a lot done
01:02:50.42 --> 01:02:53.70 With a little but as we grow it's clear
01:02:54.34 --> 01:02:59.14 That any tire people for specific roles and accept the except that I can't do everything
01:02:59.14 --> 01:03:04.50 I'm very used to getting stuff done and doing everything myself and it feels a little weird trusting someone else to do it
01:03:04.50 --> 01:03:09.22 How can I shift my mindset to appreciate being a manager over an individual contributor?
01:03:10.58 --> 01:03:12.58 So
01:03:12.58 --> 01:03:18.26 Straight up out of the gate you are actually failing as a leader by doing what you're doing
01:03:18.74 --> 01:03:20.74 But by continuing to
01:03:21.78 --> 01:03:27.54 Do things yourself getting the weeds and not let people lead you're actually failing as a leader and therefore failing the team
01:03:27.54 --> 01:03:30.34 So number one you have to
01:03:31.38 --> 01:03:33.38 Watch out for that and
01:03:33.70 --> 01:03:34.82 You know
01:03:34.82 --> 01:03:38.42 By the way that means the more time that you spend in the weeds
01:03:39.86 --> 01:03:42.02 Getting stuff done yourself because you're so perfect
01:03:42.18 --> 01:03:45.78 That's the last time that you're thinking about strategy. That's the last time you're thinking about you know
01:03:45.78 --> 01:03:50.26 What's gonna happen tomorrow and future operations and that's not good
01:03:51.54 --> 01:03:53.54 to be in that situation
01:03:54.18 --> 01:03:56.18 so
01:03:56.18 --> 01:04:01.78 First of all you need to build the trust with these people you don't have to give a hundred percent trust to someone out of the gate
01:04:02.10 --> 01:04:07.14 If I if we're in a company and I hire you and I'm gonna have you doing some task
01:04:08.10 --> 01:04:11.94 That doesn't mean I say hey echo here's the task go do it and now I'm just gonna walk away
01:04:12.58 --> 01:04:14.58 I don't even know you
01:04:14.58 --> 01:04:16.58 I don't know how well you can do the task
01:04:16.58 --> 01:04:20.02 So I'm gonna say hey echo here's the task actually watch me do it
01:04:20.90 --> 01:04:23.62 Okay, you've seen me do it now. I'm gonna watch you do it
01:04:23.62 --> 01:04:28.42 Okay, cool you seem to be doing that pretty well. I'm gonna come check on you in two hours
01:04:28.82 --> 01:04:34.58 See how it's going come back two hours next day. I check you once every five hours next day. I check you in the morning
01:04:34.58 --> 01:04:37.86 I check you once in the afternoon next day. I just check you a lunchtime
01:04:38.90 --> 01:04:41.94 Maybe two three four days later. I check you once every other day
01:04:42.58 --> 01:04:47.46 Pretty soon you're good to go and guess what I'm doing I'm doing something else doing something that I should be doing
01:04:47.70 --> 01:04:50.82 I built the trust I confirm that you know how to do it. I
01:04:50.82 --> 01:04:55.14 You trust me because now I trust you. We're building some team and some relationship
01:04:57.38 --> 01:04:59.38 So that's all good. So
01:04:59.70 --> 01:05:01.70 To the original point
01:05:02.02 --> 01:05:04.42 Though I think the way that you shift your mindset
01:05:04.98 --> 01:05:07.70 Is to recognize that micro management is actually failure
01:05:08.42 --> 01:05:13.06 No progress is made while you're micro managing the longer you are micro managing someone
01:05:13.54 --> 01:05:18.50 The longer it takes for them to develop as a human being and as a useful person in your organization
01:05:18.50 --> 01:05:20.50 Every minute that you
01:05:21.22 --> 01:05:26.66 Micro manage someone is a minute of them not thinking for themselves is a minute for them not taking ownership of something
01:05:26.66 --> 01:05:32.10 It's a micro managing your task. You're not taking ownership of it. If you're not taking ownership of it. We know where that leads
01:05:34.18 --> 01:05:36.18 So
01:05:36.82 --> 01:05:38.34 Let people learn
01:05:38.34 --> 01:05:41.06 Let people lead and to not do that is
01:05:41.70 --> 01:05:43.06 Fairly
01:05:43.06 --> 01:05:44.26 Don't fail
01:05:44.26 --> 01:05:47.54 One-time monotone in Hawaii you get your job as licensed at 15
01:05:47.54 --> 01:05:51.54 They I don't know what it is now. That was long time ago obviously
01:05:52.10 --> 01:05:58.82 But I learned to drive with my dad before that you know when we're young we'd get in quite this dirt roads everywhere
01:05:58.90 --> 01:06:03.30 So he's like hey, you know, and it started with when we were young when we're young young like
01:06:04.58 --> 01:06:06.58 7-8 years old we'd sit on his lap
01:06:07.38 --> 01:06:10.66 So he do the shifting in the gas in the break and stuff like that dirt roads
01:06:10.66 --> 01:06:15.46 We'd just do the steering so what it kind of started with then after while he's like okay
01:06:15.46 --> 01:06:19.22 Now we're just gonna learn how to do this you know, it was a manual training
01:06:19.22 --> 01:06:23.14 Stickship so he was like okay now you just learn how to go
01:06:23.14 --> 01:06:27.70 Right and now it's going shift gears all on the dirt road whatever and so
01:06:27.94 --> 01:06:32.34 I was like just turn 15 or maybe 14 and he was like hey
01:06:33.22 --> 01:06:34.98 He's like all right, let's go drive
01:06:35.38 --> 01:06:38.98 You know usually it'd be like we were going to the beach on the way home. Hey, let's take this dirt road
01:06:38.98 --> 01:06:40.34 You can steer kind of thing
01:06:40.34 --> 01:06:42.34 But this was actually like okay. Let's go drive
01:06:42.34 --> 01:06:46.82 So I'm like all right, but he pops me in the front seat and he goes all right take us there
01:06:46.82 --> 01:06:50.58 We're going wherever we're going down to the beach. He's like all right take us there. I was like dang
01:06:50.58 --> 01:06:54.42 I don't know but I've steered before I've shifted I haven't done the whole thing all at once
01:06:54.42 --> 01:06:57.06 But he's sitting right there. You just said take us there. I was like dope
01:06:57.62 --> 01:07:01.54 I took took him there whatever he didn't critique much, you know
01:07:02.74 --> 01:07:06.90 But I got there and he just kind of let it happen. It was the same kind of thing where
01:07:06.90 --> 01:07:12.26 First he's checking my steering then he's tried this is over time
01:07:12.26 --> 01:07:18.26 Yeah, he's kind of dialed and yeah after a while it's like boom he's doesn't I he's still managing he's right there
01:07:18.26 --> 01:07:23.46 He could slide his foot over to the break if he needs to I guess if he puts his hand on the wheel
01:07:23.46 --> 01:07:29.54 Steering away from the oncoming truck if need be yeah and at the same time he's letting me make little micro mistakes
01:07:29.54 --> 01:07:31.54 I hit the curb a little bit
01:07:31.54 --> 01:07:38.02 I was more like you know stick shift. You know you do too much or yeah and he let that happen
01:07:38.34 --> 01:07:43.38 Because that's my thing to figure out the feel because each guy is different and it's cool because that's actually good
01:07:44.02 --> 01:07:49.94 One time we were going on an operation my first deployment to Iraq and
01:07:51.46 --> 01:07:57.46 We were driving a far distance through cities we'd never been through before and we got turned around
01:07:57.46 --> 01:08:00.74 in the city and
01:08:01.46 --> 01:08:06.98 We worked had a far way to go to our objective. It was a kind of a high profile operation and
01:08:07.78 --> 01:08:16.66 Work we stopped and I hear the call in the radio like all stop and I say something along lines of
01:08:18.18 --> 01:08:23.94 What's up and you know the the point man which is the lead nav in the vehicles
01:08:23.94 --> 01:08:27.94 He comes up in the radio he's like just trying to get my bearings
01:08:29.22 --> 01:08:31.22 Little stress noise
01:08:31.46 --> 01:08:36.18 I walk up so I get out of my vehicle just to make sure this guy's one of my bros and I
01:08:36.98 --> 01:08:38.98 Walk up to vehicle and
01:08:38.98 --> 01:08:44.50 He's in there and I could see he's he's he's flustered. He's flustered and he's
01:08:45.62 --> 01:08:46.98 You know
01:08:46.98 --> 01:08:51.46 I don't want to see in bearist but he's flustered and now I'm there
01:08:51.46 --> 01:08:56.02 Yeah, you know what I mean? Yes, and I think his thoughts are
01:08:56.66 --> 01:09:02.90 Jocquoise you know jocquoise gonna be mad or whatever yeah, and I I go up and he's
01:09:04.26 --> 01:09:09.94 He's cracked open the door right I open the door on the Humvee and I go you know
01:09:10.58 --> 01:09:12.58 What's up man
01:09:12.90 --> 01:09:18.10 Just in the most mellow voice about I go hey, what's up man? He goes I I don't know where we are
01:09:18.10 --> 01:09:22.58 And I was like cool man. We'll set security let me know when you got it dial and he's like

01:09:29.62 --> 01:09:35.22 But when I walked up to him, you know you could see that he was panicking because you know you got we had a bunch of vehicles
01:09:35.22 --> 01:09:38.26 You know you got seven vehicles with us and and
01:09:38.82 --> 01:09:42.82 They're all driving around and I've done two laps around the you know it's not fun
01:09:42.82 --> 01:09:49.42 And you know you make it through and like pass the enemy one time you got away with who yeah now you went by him three times
01:09:50.14 --> 01:09:52.42 It's not cool and every one of the whole
01:09:52.82 --> 01:09:58.50 But true because sitting there in the vehicles going hold on jackass is gonna run us by this check point again
01:09:58.50 --> 01:10:02.66 Or by this thing again. Yeah, all of us so but yeah just went up hey bro

01:10:07.38 --> 01:10:12.30 We're gonna set security let me know when you got to figure it out. I'll be good so good man and that's
01:10:12.58 --> 01:10:17.10 That's so good on you because you know everyone is feeling the threat like what you're saying for sure
01:10:17.10 --> 01:10:18.30 It's like dang where is this guy?
01:10:18.30 --> 01:10:22.22 Lena's what I don't know I'm sure everyone was feeling that then it's like all right
01:10:22.22 --> 01:10:24.90 I got a kind of detached from that feeling and go
01:10:24.90 --> 01:10:29.66 You know yeah and and and then you know I got them a radio because that was you know I just said
01:10:30.18 --> 01:10:31.78 I said the guy's name. I'm like hey
01:10:31.94 --> 01:10:36.02 Just getting it sorted out right now. We're in be rolling here to about a few minutes when we know we're at
01:10:36.02 --> 01:10:38.58 And everyone's you know setsk you're doing
01:10:39.10 --> 01:10:45.02 There was another time we got ambushed on that same deployment sure and I was in vehicle number two
01:10:45.02 --> 01:10:51.70 and we're in a big convoy and the the ambush pretty much was aimed at the center and then the back of the convoy
01:10:52.02 --> 01:10:59.58 So a bunch of machine gun fire a bunch of RPGs and nothing really hit and right in fact nothing did hit the RPGs went over us and
01:11:01.10 --> 01:11:04.22 And I was I would never say much on the radio right and
01:11:04.22 --> 01:11:06.22 And the guy in the back vehicle
01:11:07.58 --> 01:11:09.58 These actually the cartoon chief
01:11:10.22 --> 01:11:16.70 But I say I didn't say much, but clearly we just got ambushed. I mean there was a massive atmosphere fire and explosions going off
01:11:16.70 --> 01:11:20.10 And we pout you know we go through that we continue on and
01:11:20.90 --> 01:11:27.14 The cartoon chief in the back he says something on the radio something along the lines of he's like you know
01:11:27.58 --> 01:11:33.10 Comes up on the radio you take hey, Jocco you know we we just got hit with an ambush back here and I got on the radio
01:11:33.10 --> 01:11:35.10 I was like Roger
01:11:36.58 --> 01:11:39.58 And you know it's like it's it you know
01:11:39.58 --> 01:11:48.10 Everybody goes okay, I guess we're all right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think you did me like that one day
01:11:48.26 --> 01:11:52.62 Yes, in fact when I said I think I mean I remember the time you didn't get a soul I was
01:11:53.50 --> 01:11:59.56 I'm forgive me right now you just talked about an actual ambush that actually I think I'm talking about something the way you last impactful
01:11:59.56 --> 01:12:03.36 Just bear with I mean you're asking for forgiveness me. I tell a grocery story
01:12:05.36 --> 01:12:10.02 It was actually this podcast we had recorded like a week or something early so I was like boom
01:12:10.92 --> 01:12:12.92 Let me finish the whole thing
01:12:13.48 --> 01:12:18.92 Get it ready to get pushed out all I need it was done all I had to do is press the button to make it live
01:12:18.92 --> 01:12:20.60 That's all I had to do and this was like a week
01:12:20.60 --> 01:12:24.52 I think it might even even been two weeks in advance. Wow. Those are the good old days. Yeah
01:12:24.52 --> 01:12:31.16 Yeah, but um and then the day came it was so done and out of my mind the day came and I was just like hey
01:12:31.16 --> 01:12:36.28 I don't know is it not on my mind so the long-served shirt I I didn't do it so
01:12:37.96 --> 01:12:40.70 I didn't press publish. It was ready because anyway, so I
01:12:41.32 --> 01:12:43.80 Wake up in the morning as he message
01:12:44.68 --> 01:12:48.72 I love bungee Twitter posts right and send that but I got a text message
01:12:48.72 --> 01:12:53.28 I think there might even been a phone call on it was a phone call and a text message from you
01:12:53.28 --> 01:12:55.28 This you know this is
01:12:56.48 --> 01:12:58.08 This is something you know
01:12:58.08 --> 01:13:01.48 I'm like right what is your one what it was? No, I had no idea
01:13:01.48 --> 01:13:04.64 It was out of my mind. I was like oh something obviously it's not you know
01:13:04.64 --> 01:13:07.60 I get it this early in the morning by the way. Yeah, you know
01:13:07.76 --> 01:13:09.76 So I look at it and
01:13:09.76 --> 01:13:14.40 So I listen to the voice message first and it was you all coming like hey, I was going
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000 Good morning
01:13:18.08 --> 01:13:20.08 So this he goes
01:13:20.08 --> 01:13:25.12 Just to sort of like you know it's Wednesday, you know we have that but that podcast we recorded that's you know
01:13:25.72 --> 01:13:27.60 That's supposed to be going on right now, so
01:13:28.08 --> 01:13:31.24 Whenever you can whenever you're ready good and post that
01:13:33.32 --> 01:13:36.66 But it wasn't like all the Twitter posts where where's the bucket spill?
01:13:36.66 --> 01:13:41.44 Which about this like you know all that and then the doctors okay whenever you're ready? It's all good
01:13:41.44 --> 01:13:46.72 You know I didn't know what happened. Maybe you're under more stress. Thank you. There we know you got to think when you're in a leadership position
01:13:46.72 --> 01:13:51.68 Not that I'm like the leader here, but if you're in a leadership position you don't know what someone else is going through
01:13:51.68 --> 01:13:55.34 I maybe you had some technical issue and I'm like gonna call you up and you look like a worse that thing
01:13:55.34 --> 01:13:57.94 And now you freak out. You make it worse. Yeah. I don't need to make it anymore
01:13:57.94 --> 01:14:00.44 There's something going on like you were sleeping
01:14:00.44 --> 01:14:08.28 Oh, I didn't want you know, but you always think about the perspective of the other person that you're dealing with and you don't want to escalate things
01:14:08.28 --> 01:14:11.60 Yeah, that's not gonna help. Yeah, just deescalate. Hey, man
01:14:11.60 --> 01:14:14.64 Just wondering what's up if you knew if you need anything for me on the podcast
01:14:14.64 --> 01:14:18.80 Maybe we need to re-record it. I don't know. Let me know. I'll go over
01:14:19.28 --> 01:14:20.72 That's where we're here for
01:14:20.72 --> 01:14:25.08 Like with two people shouting at each other and you chime in so they stop drowning in your shouting
01:14:25.08 --> 01:14:28.26 I got three people shouting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's in it up
01:14:29.28 --> 01:14:31.28 Anyway next question
01:14:34.08 --> 01:14:39.04 Jocco. I'm not sure I agree with your statements not to pursue
01:14:39.04 --> 01:14:48.04 Belts in Jiu Jitsu. It doesn't seem wrong to me to benchmark success using a rise in rank as a quantifiable measure of success
01:14:48.76 --> 01:14:50.52 As a person
01:14:50.52 --> 01:14:57.72 Is working to master their craft any craft. It's nice to have markers for accomplishment and engagement wife belts
01:14:58.40 --> 01:15:05.16 Why have belts if they're not to be striped for or why have them right? Yeah, and that's actually a little conversation
01:15:05.16 --> 01:15:09.96 I had that I as soon as he asked me this. This is with Brandon no brand in particular. Yeah
01:15:10.68 --> 01:15:13.80 He's he's been around like since day one
01:15:13.80 --> 01:15:18.44 Yeah, and in the game here and we were going back and forth on something
01:15:18.44 --> 01:15:21.44 He said he actually sent me this random because he sent me text about stuff
01:15:21.44 --> 01:15:24.08 You know whatever we're doing some projects and whatnot and
01:15:25.52 --> 01:15:27.52 He sent me this random thing
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.40 Well, I guess it's random to meet it was random to him. Maybe he just listened to a podcast where we were talking about this
01:15:33.40 --> 01:15:37.36 He said you know hey, I don't know you don't want to go this stuff about belts and
01:15:39.24 --> 01:15:45.000 So and by the way Brandon is had a goal of doing a hundred burpees and ten minutes
01:15:45.32 --> 01:15:48.68 Brandon isn't good shape. He's an athlete athletic dude
01:15:49.16 --> 01:15:55.84 And for some reason he can't do a hundred burpees and ten minutes. I don't know where he's at right now. We are publicly calling him out. Yeah to post his
01:15:56.92 --> 01:16:00.28 You know video video no cut no cuts
01:16:00.28 --> 01:16:04.84 Yeah, or maybe doesn't have to post all the thing I take his work for because he's owned it a bunch of times
01:16:04.84 --> 01:16:09.12 He'll put like he'll do a hundred and oh no
01:16:09.12 --> 01:16:14.52 I think what he's been doing he's been doing ten minutes worth however many he can do he gets like 84
01:16:15.16 --> 01:16:20.52 Yeah, so any post it like I did 84 in ten minutes was that you can do 10 sets of 10
01:16:20.52 --> 01:16:23.46 Yeah, that's a one to ten every 30 10 every minute
01:16:23.46 --> 01:16:27.52 Yeah, or something it have to be less because actual burpees will take a certain amount of time
01:16:27.52 --> 01:16:32.88 Yeah, no, no, I'm telling you 10 in a minute is not that hard
01:16:33.52 --> 01:16:42.48 Yeah, but plus your rest 10 burpee pull ups in a minute is hard or yeah, but still a good measure so just regular burpees
01:16:44.56 --> 01:16:46.56 But back to the conversation
01:16:47.36 --> 01:16:50.36 So Brandon hit me up and
01:16:51.52 --> 01:16:54.16 And you know I understand belts
01:16:54.16 --> 01:16:58.32 You know and it's because we've said on here like don't worry about belts don't worry about the belts the belts are gonna come
01:16:58.32 --> 01:17:01.20 I understand belts and I understand
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.44 Trying to earn a rank and that's cool, but I'm telling you
01:17:08.88 --> 01:17:11.44 At some point and I think this will happen to everybody
01:17:13.52 --> 01:17:15.12 At some point
01:17:15.12 --> 01:17:21.12 Jiu-jitsu becomes a lot more than just belts and eventually the Jiu-jitsu itself
01:17:21.12 --> 01:17:24.72 Completely bypasses
01:17:25.84 --> 01:17:28.64 What the belts are and what the belts mean now
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.64 I could you could say back to me like well, let's get your buck belt
01:17:33.20 --> 01:17:36.48 Yeah, and so that's why you feel that way because of course they don't matter to you you're already black belts
01:17:36.48 --> 01:17:37.84 You you know, but
01:17:37.84 --> 01:17:42.88 The fact is that that didn't happen to me at black belt that happened to me at like purple belt
01:17:43.12 --> 01:17:45.12 I think about midway
01:17:45.12 --> 01:17:52.32 Of my purple belt time I had no care whatsoever of what belt color I was literally zero
01:17:53.44 --> 01:17:55.44 And I just wanted to
01:17:55.84 --> 01:18:00.88 Get better. I just wanted to know more. I just wanted to keep training and never even thought about it after that and now like
01:18:01.52 --> 01:18:05.20 Even like degrees on your on your black belt
01:18:06.32 --> 01:18:11.12 Like Pete I was talking to Pete Roberts today. He's like what degree are you? You know he's a black belt on the black belt
01:18:11.12 --> 01:18:15.84 He's like what degree are you and I was like, I don't know I don't know
01:18:15.84 --> 01:18:22.80 I got my black belt in 2005. What does that mean? You know what I mean? Like I don't have the tape on there with how many degrees I am not that
01:18:22.80 --> 01:18:27.12 I don't respect it, but I just don't care for me personally
01:18:27.76 --> 01:18:34.16 So and and I think that this isn't like he's like Brandon talk about you know to master any crafts
01:18:34.16 --> 01:18:39.28 I think it's the same with any craft that you're trying to master yeah if you're trying to master the craft
01:18:39.28 --> 01:18:41.28 You're not going to master the craft
01:18:41.28 --> 01:18:50.24 Hopefully and eventually the craft itself becomes more important than the rank that comes with being skilled at the craft
01:18:50.80 --> 01:18:58.000 That's what I would hope for that's what by the way that also makes it a lot easier to keep pursuing because I don't care
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.48 I'm not sitting there going I hope I could strike on my belt today. No, I don't care if I could strike my belt
01:19:02.48 --> 01:19:07.28 I want to go learn more and guess what's going to propel you towards more stripes wanting to learn more
01:19:07.28 --> 01:19:10.96 Yeah, wanting more stripes does not propel you towards getting more stripes
01:19:11.28 --> 01:19:16.48 What propels you towards getting more stripes and getting advanced in any craft is getting better at that craft
01:19:16.96 --> 01:19:21.28 So focus on getting better at the craft. Yes, sir the belts are gonna come. Yes, sir
01:19:21.84 --> 01:19:23.84 Even your belt's gonna come. Okay, preach it
01:19:25.12 --> 01:19:27.12 I'm not concerned with belt
01:19:27.68 --> 01:19:30.16 So we're glad you're not that you ain't got much in your future
01:19:30.16 --> 01:19:34.96 No, let's yeah, and I think that
01:19:36.16 --> 01:19:41.44 This it's like a matter of perspective kit first off you being a black belt and thinking that or whatever and be like yeah, that's
01:19:42.08 --> 01:19:48.24 Easy it seems like that's obvious that oh it's easy for you to say because you're a black belt pot at the same time doesn't kind of go along with that detachment thing
01:19:48.40 --> 01:19:53.36 So like hey, I'm not in the game there's no reason for me to be striving for any belt right now
01:19:53.36 --> 01:19:58.64 So I can be detached. I'm not emotionally invested in the whole situation. I can look back and and at the same time
01:19:58.64 --> 01:20:00.64 Understand when I came up
01:20:01.52 --> 01:20:05.44 Me being focused on belts would not have got me here. Yeah, you know like you have that clear vision
01:20:05.44 --> 01:20:13.20 I that's natural thing to be like a blue belt and I wish I could wear that purple belt and everyone who didn't know me and respect me as a pro belt
01:20:13.20 --> 01:20:18.56 And I'll become tapping some of the purple belts right now. Yeah, and bro. Oh, do you do the side note?
01:20:19.20 --> 01:20:22.56 I don't know if you know this, but if you know the feeling of
01:20:22.88 --> 01:20:26.16 wanting that purple belt really bad and I just want that purple
01:20:26.16 --> 01:20:28.16 purple belt and your skills
01:20:28.16 --> 01:20:34.16 From your first the from your instructor's standpoint. Don't match purple belt and promotion time comes along and you're okay
01:20:34.16 --> 01:20:37.68 This is the time I get my brand you don't get that purple belt brand. You know how sad you're gonna be
01:20:37.92 --> 01:20:42.88 real bad. I have known people that quit the gym straight up because they didn't get built
01:20:43.28 --> 01:20:50.24 Promoted on a certain day and you know that was the day that's really sad it is it's sad from top to bottom for sure
01:20:50.24 --> 01:20:54.56 That's the side note, but I guess sad was neither right where well it's sad for them
01:20:54.56 --> 01:20:59.92 Yes, like because if you if you're in that zone where you should be getting your purple belt at some time
01:21:00.24 --> 01:21:02.96 Maybe this promotion maybe next promotion maybe some other promotion
01:21:03.12 --> 01:21:06.56 That means you're dedicated to it now you're just gonna walk away because you didn't get
01:21:07.04 --> 01:21:12.52 Belts yeah, that's yeah, that's rough and like I said like that stayed a mine can really really
01:21:12.52 --> 01:21:19.04 Jammy and true story and I've heard of people where they didn't get their belt and then maybe someone else did not
01:21:19.04 --> 01:21:22.40 Maybe straight up other people did and it was there belt, you know like there
01:21:22.40 --> 01:21:26.32 Oh, they're in bad super mad to the point where they're vocal about it. I tapped that guy out
01:21:26.32 --> 01:21:32.08 Why he get his belt pop up open? Yeah, saying that so yeah, it's it'll jam you up just that whole mindset one thing
01:21:32.08 --> 01:21:34.88 You know, I would say to those people that might be thinking that way
01:21:36.40 --> 01:21:39.60 For my perspective and for many due to instructors
01:21:40.72 --> 01:21:44.08 The your you're advancing and you're getting promoted
01:21:44.96 --> 01:21:48.72 Based on your potential not based on your skill level to
01:21:48.72 --> 01:21:52.40 Yeah, because you might be
01:21:53.92 --> 01:22:00.40 You might not have a lot of potential and so you know what hey man the guys you know he can't train he's
01:22:00.96 --> 01:22:05.68 You know 68 years old and he's been training for a year and a half
01:22:06.32 --> 01:22:11.76 He's learned a lot of knowledge. He's here all the time. Yeah, he can't tap out any other blue belts
01:22:12.48 --> 01:22:17.28 We're giving him his blue belt because for potential of him as a 68 year old man
01:22:17.28 --> 01:22:21.20 That never worked out before now he's training you jitsu you that guy's a blue belt. Yeah
01:22:22.80 --> 01:22:26.32 Now the further you go up, you know black belt is a little bit more serious
01:22:27.44 --> 01:22:32.64 So it was brown so it's purple, but I'm saying you're getting judged against yourself and that's an extreme example
01:22:32.64 --> 01:22:35.12 Buy someone else by the way not buy yourself
01:22:35.76 --> 01:22:38.40 You being judged by your instructor not yourself. Yeah, that's right. That's right
01:22:39.12 --> 01:22:44.08 Just like yeah, man, and that's it and that's an important thing to me once what's your two-year point
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:47.20 Everything that we're talking about right now makes you jitsu suck
01:22:48.48 --> 01:22:54.000 Right it makes you like it makes it maybe it'll make you mad it'll make you frustrated it'll make you and it'll make it political
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.48 And this guy got it and I didn't know that's for me. I just don't like it that stuff. Yeah, you know
01:22:58.48 --> 01:23:00.48 Don't even like that stuff. Yeah
01:23:01.44 --> 01:23:09.60 When you're ready you're instructor's gonna promote you until then keep training yeah and and by the way also in your work skills
01:23:10.24 --> 01:23:12.72 When you're ready to get promoted you'll get promoted
01:23:12.72 --> 01:23:18.08 Yeah, and if you're not ready you won't or there's not an opening you won't you know what you do to solve that
01:23:18.40 --> 01:23:20.40 Don't get frustrated
01:23:20.64 --> 01:23:27.12 Don't get all crazy don't blame the guy that did get promoted don't undermine him. You know what you do keep kicking ass
01:23:27.52 --> 01:23:29.52 Wait next time it'll be your turn
01:23:29.52 --> 01:23:31.92 Enjoy what you're doing master your craft
01:23:32.96 --> 01:23:34.96 Don't let your craft become your master
01:23:37.20 --> 01:23:39.20 I
01:23:39.20 --> 01:23:44.000 Yeah, and that's what happens right yeah, so that the thing control you
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.32 Is that a you controlling the thing instead of you mastering it? It's starting to master you and getting your head
01:23:48.32 --> 01:23:54.32 Yeah, but he does make a good point and here's the thing is that this is a mix of perspective so
01:23:55.12 --> 01:23:56.56 Where
01:23:56.56 --> 01:24:01.60 Or a clashing of perspectives where is like art you know as a person working to master their craft any craft
01:24:01.60 --> 01:24:04.80 It's nice to have markers for a accomplishment and engagement
01:24:04.80 --> 01:24:09.04 Yeah, and you know what I actually texted back to him. I'm like hey man. I know I'm not normal
01:24:10.08 --> 01:24:13.12 Yeah, I'm not normal and all I need is a rock and a hill
01:24:14.32 --> 01:24:17.12 Yeah, that's what I texted to when he laughed right but
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.80 So so there are normal people that need to have like I want to go
01:24:22.80 --> 01:24:28.72 I want to see I want to have a checkpoint and that's okay. Yeah, and that's why guess what there are belts and jiu-jitsu
01:24:28.72 --> 01:24:34.000 And you can't get sort of I don't we don't really give a lot of stripes out at victory like me
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:42.16 Jeff Glover rain lister Craig James. I mean we'll give out like occasional stripes, you know for various reasons
01:24:42.48 --> 01:24:47.04 But most of the time it's like oh the guys ready for his next belt right? It's good at tone yeah
01:24:47.04 --> 01:24:50.96 Usually the stripes are that's a subtle thing in my opinion like I've stripes don't
01:24:51.84 --> 01:24:54.08 Reflect much compared to boy belts
01:24:54.08 --> 01:25:04.80 No, nonetheless, I mean yeah cool back in the difference you like a four-stroke blue belt right guy was the deal
01:25:04.96 --> 01:25:10.48 But he's seen you know and you know what to to degrade what you're saying and what brand and saying
01:25:10.48 --> 01:25:15.92 You know when we do a lot of stripes and a lot of different colored belts kids right and that's need that
01:25:15.92 --> 01:25:17.92 Be the point and as a grown-ass adult
01:25:18.64 --> 01:25:20.64 Branding
01:25:20.64 --> 01:25:25.28 No, as a grown man you should be like I'm just here to learn yeah, you're to get after well to me
01:25:25.44 --> 01:25:28.56 What he's saying doesn't clash with what you're saying in my opinion no
01:25:28.56 --> 01:25:31.36 The matter is a brand and is brand and is you know
01:25:31.36 --> 01:25:34.72 I don't know him that well, but you know we go back and forth a lot
01:25:35.20 --> 01:25:38.96 He's a guy that's like metric driven you know like I'm gonna get right somebody get this
01:25:38.96 --> 01:25:45.84 And we get that and that's awesome. That's what makes him successful and you know what he does and the craft that he has mastered very successful
01:25:46.24 --> 01:25:47.52 But
01:25:47.52 --> 01:25:49.76 He likes to have those yeah those measurements
01:25:49.76 --> 01:25:54.40 Yeah, I've metrics to go off and say look I just crush this this goal boom done yeah
01:25:54.80 --> 01:26:00.08 So we yeah, and so with belts is gonna be a little bit different just like with promotions and you know based on skill
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:07.20 So you he says it's nice to have markers and you think it is nice of course after after when you got your black belt
01:26:08.16 --> 01:26:11.36 For you to say I don't care the fact that I got this black belt
01:26:11.36 --> 01:26:15.84 I don't care about that at all. I don't know if I would believe no, no, you're you'd be correct
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.96 Yeah, you'd be correct. I was I was stoked. Yeah, no. It's just a matter of
01:26:18.96 --> 01:26:24.16 What is driving for me? What kind of surprise me? Do like I was expecting it right which should tell you something
01:26:24.64 --> 01:26:29.20 Yes, I wasn't in there like tonight's probably gonna be big no, no, I like showed up at the gym and
01:26:29.68 --> 01:26:33.60 Trained or whatever and then all of a sudden it was special ceremony time
01:26:33.60 --> 01:26:40.24 And we got the black belt yeah, and I was stoked for sure. Yeah. I was stoked put you know what's funny is like at the team
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000 Like people
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.12 People like I don't know who heard about it, but people like hey man, I would you cut your black belt and I was like yeah, yeah, but I didn't tell anyone
01:26:49.12 --> 01:26:53.28 I wasn't like hey everyone. I got my black belt. Yeah, yeah, you know
01:26:55.04 --> 01:26:58.40 But you know what you know what you know what belt I cared the most about was my purple belt
01:26:58.88 --> 01:27:02.72 Yeah, when I got my purple belt I was super pumped yeah
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:07.60 At that time it was a big deal yeah, yeah, you're purple belt got purple belt from family
01:27:07.60 --> 01:27:14.96 Santos yeah, I wasn't given away that purple belt either no, I'm gonna do you had that thing yeah
01:27:14.96 --> 01:27:18.64 And you know what with and I don't know because obviously I wasn't there at that time
01:27:18.72 --> 01:27:23.04 But I think it's always gonna be like that. Well, if you get a purple belt that's a big deal
01:27:23.04 --> 01:27:28.32 Yeah, even now it seems like that's definitely a big deal because there's just so many people now doing
01:27:28.32 --> 01:27:32.72 You did too. No purple belt purple belt is a legitimate when you're a purple belt
01:27:33.36 --> 01:27:36.32 You will not lose in a fight to normal person
01:27:36.32 --> 01:27:41.84 No, in my opinion. Oh could you get caught with a punchy asher? Yeah, but a normal you know
01:27:41.84 --> 01:27:47.28 You've got a very high high percentage of winning a fight against a normal person if you are a purple belt in GJ2
01:27:47.28 --> 01:27:52.32 Yeah, a good purple belt yeah, meaning not someone that just like got a purple belt for no reason
01:27:52.96 --> 01:27:59.76 Real purple right GJ2. I mean a purple belt you're rolling like when I roll the purple belt it's a good roll. Yeah, you know
01:27:59.76 --> 01:28:03.68 There's a good roll. It's not like all this guys just a purple belt right blue belt
01:28:04.72 --> 01:28:06.24 most blue belts
01:28:06.24 --> 01:28:09.28 You don't have to worry about much of anything
01:28:09.28 --> 01:28:11.60 Yeah, with your higher level. Yes, yes
01:28:11.60 --> 01:28:16.88 I mean you're not wearing will you roll with most blue belts right? I'm worried when I roll with everybody
01:28:16.88 --> 01:28:19.28 Yeah, so well, no, no, no, no worried
01:28:19.28 --> 01:28:23.36 No, I'm just joking. Yeah, I dig it. It's not about your disarrown
01:28:23.36 --> 01:28:26.000 No, not seeing it disrespectful but
01:28:26.88 --> 01:28:30.80 I'm not saying you're disrespectful to a blue belt but but realistically you know
01:28:30.80 --> 01:28:36.96 That chances are there's no possible way for them to submit you very small chance
01:28:36.96 --> 01:28:40.80 Yeah, yeah, the purple belt the skill levels don't matter. What about swap a triangle on your or something
01:28:40.80 --> 01:28:45.52 And put some grab your arms somewhere. Oh, yeah, yeah, I can have no what you rolled with no
01:28:45.52 --> 01:28:47.52 Well, yeah, he time me out. Oh
01:28:47.84 --> 01:28:53.60 Yeah, I mean not like the light but yeah, like within the last year. Yeah, yeah, he straight in my arm out real far
01:28:54.32 --> 01:28:56.32 I had to go into level nine defense mode
01:28:56.32 --> 01:29:02.24 Sounds of urgency. Yeah, oh, I went to full and not any surprised me that was the thing
01:29:02.64 --> 01:29:09.04 You know, we're rolling and all of a sudden and he's a purple belt. That's there you have it. There's a classic example in this in the defense
01:29:09.04 --> 01:29:12.56 No, I'm gonna give him a name. I'm gonna give him a nickname right now good Noah
01:29:13.12 --> 01:29:17.28 Because he's good and he's very handsome by the way. He's better than he's a
01:29:17.28 --> 01:29:18.56 I like you judge that one
01:29:18.56 --> 01:29:25.52 He's better than a typical purple belt though. He's really really yeah, yeah, yeah, but nonetheless to your point that's exactly your point though
01:29:25.52 --> 01:29:30.56 You're good purple belt. You're you're not you don't have many holes. No, maybe some timing things
01:29:30.56 --> 01:29:37.52 Maybe some men or whatever good. Yeah, he's a classic example. Yeah, no was a good purple belt watch out
01:29:37.84 --> 01:29:39.84 But yeah, you don't
01:29:39.84 --> 01:29:43.28 Perth super know it. I asked me all the time when do I get my brown belt? No, I'm just kidding
01:29:43.28 --> 01:29:49.04 You know, he doesn't care. Yeah, he's type of dude that's like hey, I'll just get it around tap everyone out
01:29:49.04 --> 01:29:55.92 Maybe one day like a me and belt maybe they won't don't care. Yeah, and that's how and so tapping out echo Charles
01:29:56.72 --> 01:30:01.04 I know, bro, what's up did you give me your brown belt once you got tapped out by him? I want it actually
01:30:01.04 --> 01:30:03.60 You know what's cool when you get tapped out by a lower belt
01:30:04.24 --> 01:30:05.76 It's like guess what
01:30:05.76 --> 01:30:08.16 Did you get to work? They should be able to wear your belt for this
01:30:09.12 --> 01:30:11.12 For the rest of your life
01:30:11.12 --> 01:30:13.12 No, no, did you do it?
01:30:13.12 --> 01:30:15.12 You do it you do you move against me?
01:30:15.12 --> 01:30:19.92 I'm gonna tap out to it. Yeah, like that's the way it works. You know, I might try the defense
01:30:20.48 --> 01:30:25.28 But did you get to works? Yes, sir. I mean we just saw Roger Gracie
01:30:25.44 --> 01:30:27.68 Hodge or Gracie against butchette
01:30:28.08 --> 01:30:32.64 Yeah, and people were a little bit freaked out. I was like yeah, did you just do works? Yeah, you know
01:30:33.04 --> 01:30:38.88 Get that choke on putchette or butchette? Is it animal? Yeah savage? Yes
01:30:38.88 --> 01:30:44.64 But get that geek-all or sunk in choke. You got you got Hodge or Gracie
01:30:45.68 --> 01:30:50.56 Ex amount of times world champion. Can you imagine his grip strength? Are you rolled with him? Yes. Yeah
01:30:50.64 --> 01:30:57.12 Grip strength. Well, how does his grip strength? It was really good, but and I'm not to go on to a whole thing about Hodge's game
01:30:57.12 --> 01:30:59.76 But he has this thing where
01:31:00.16 --> 01:31:05.36 This is weird if you don't know the depth of jujitsu, but he has this feeling that he has all bases covered
01:31:05.36 --> 01:31:11.76 So he's not necessarily his game isn't to out hustle you has not to out speed you and it's not out strength you for sure
01:31:11.84 --> 01:31:17.28 But it's like he it's like he has this whole base like all his bases in the jujitsu
01:31:17.76 --> 01:31:23.92 Situation they're all covered. Yeah, so he'll do this thing that and he was trying to do them butchette, but you know
01:31:23.92 --> 01:31:25.92 Which has just really really good
01:31:26.32 --> 01:31:27.76 He'll grab one
01:31:27.76 --> 01:31:34.24 sleeve with the opposite hand grab the elbow and it'll just from close to our pedal and it'll pull and he'll just wind up on your back
01:31:34.24 --> 01:31:39.12 And there's nothing you can do about it all your little defenses. He's got this covered. Yeah, no problem
01:31:39.12 --> 01:31:44.40 And it's just this thing that it just it's like this eventuality that you have no defense for that
01:31:44.40 --> 01:31:51.04 How it feels his whole game. Yeah, so yeah, I mean it's crazy that he was able to bring that same game to someone like buccia
01:31:51.04 --> 01:31:53.44 Yeah, you could be judged as a beast. Yeah
01:31:53.84 --> 01:31:59.60 He's he's yeah, it's just crazy, but yeah, that's how nonetheless back to the point is it don't pursue the belt
01:31:59.60 --> 01:32:05.60 That's not the pursuit the pursuit is getting better the belts will come when the belt comes to it to to
01:32:06.24 --> 01:32:12.08 Brandon's point when the belt comes that is nice and to me when you get your belt from your instructor not from yourself
01:32:12.96 --> 01:32:17.04 Yeah, when you get you get a belt yourself, but if you're the guy who's getting mad
01:32:18.64 --> 01:32:22.16 If you're the guy that's getting mad and because you think you should have got your belt
01:32:22.32 --> 01:32:24.32 You're thinking you're getting your belt from yourself
01:32:24.80 --> 01:32:26.32 That's what you're thinking oh
01:32:26.32 --> 01:32:30.80 In your head yes, yeah, yeah, exactly right so forget I'm ready. Yeah, I'm ready exactly
01:32:30.80 --> 01:32:34.80 Not up to you. It's not up to you. You can tap out all the back belts. It's still not up to you
01:32:35.36 --> 01:32:37.36 It's up to instructor anyway
01:32:37.36 --> 01:32:40.000 When you get your purple belt brown belt black belt
01:32:40.64 --> 01:32:42.000 Yeah, that's belt
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.08 I would say this happens more times than not
01:32:44.08 --> 01:32:47.68 If you're below belt you're rolling you're getting good you're learning a lot when you get a purple
01:32:47.68 --> 01:32:52.64 But purple belt that's gonna empower you so much to be like now my standard just mentally is higher now
01:32:52.64 --> 01:32:59.76 I'm a purple belt now. That's my minimum standard right now. Well a purple belt is full on in the game
01:33:00.96 --> 01:33:11.76 Right, you can't really be super casual and get a purple belt right. I'm saying it is you're gonna have a lot of pride with that
01:33:11.76 --> 01:33:14.96 Well, I wouldn't say empowering I would say it puts you
01:33:16.72 --> 01:33:19.52 It raises the bar on you
01:33:19.52 --> 01:33:24.72 Yeah, like once you're wearing a purple belt you can't be you know you now you're like I can't tap these blue belts anymore
01:33:24.72 --> 01:33:30.64 You might but I'm saying yeah same thing to me to handle tomato raises the bar yeah, what do you say it raises your standards?
01:33:31.04 --> 01:33:36.72 Yeah, rolling like my own state basically exactly what I said yeah, like the bar is raised. Yeah, I got a represent
01:33:36.72 --> 01:33:43.28 Yes, you know all this stuff. It's like it comes with the sense of pride. Yes. It's a huge it's a deal and that's why also when you're a blue belt
01:33:43.60 --> 01:33:46.88 Enjoy being a blue belt you can take more risks you can get tapped out doesn't matter
01:33:46.88 --> 01:33:48.88 You let it flow yeah
01:33:49.76 --> 01:33:56.32 100% but yeah when you get that belt yeah, be happy be private posted on Facebook and you know thank you're training partners
01:33:56.32 --> 01:33:57.84 All right stuff
01:33:57.84 --> 01:34:01.28 But don't just pursue the belt man. It'll jam you on the big time
01:34:02.16 --> 01:34:08.000 Next question. I'm a 24 year old machinist. I work CNC machines do setups in order tooling
01:34:08.40 --> 01:34:14.80 Most of the people I work with have worked here for over 15 years. The owner my company wants to make me the shot manager and honestly
01:34:14.80 --> 01:34:18.72 I'm not too tore up about it. I feel like the older guys
01:34:19.60 --> 01:34:22.000 Who've been around won't want to take
01:34:22.56 --> 01:34:25.28 scheduling and manufacturing advice from a young guy
01:34:27.44 --> 01:34:32.48 I have good relationships with all the the shop guys, but I'm worried about stepping into this role so soon
01:34:33.12 --> 01:34:35.84 Only been with the company for three years any advice
01:34:36.96 --> 01:34:40.56 Okay, your boss isn't asking you to do this job if you're not ready for it
01:34:40.56 --> 01:34:46.80 That's that's number one and the fact that you don't think you're ready is a good sign of set this before because it means that you're humble
01:34:47.12 --> 01:34:48.64 So you feel like that that's good
01:34:48.64 --> 01:34:52.64 That's probably one of the reasons why you're doing well. I'm probably one of the reasons that your boss thinks you're ready for the job is because you're humble
01:34:52.64 --> 01:34:53.84 So that's good
01:34:53.84 --> 01:34:59.20 But you also have to remember that being humble has to be balanced that got me of leadership with confidence
01:35:00.32 --> 01:35:02.08 And even with a little bit of aggression
01:35:02.40 --> 01:35:08.72 So there's a reason that you're getting asked to do this job and the boss needs you to step up now just because you become the manager
01:35:08.72 --> 01:35:11.60 The boss doesn't mean that you have to start bossing people around
01:35:12.80 --> 01:35:17.44 Right it actually means that you should remain humble that you should take input from them
01:35:17.92 --> 01:35:25.04 That you can still take advice from them as opposed to just giving them advice all those things are fine and
01:35:26.64 --> 01:35:28.48 I just kind of asked this question the other day a young
01:35:29.44 --> 01:35:30.48 construction
01:35:30.48 --> 01:35:32.48 business and
01:35:32.48 --> 01:35:39.12 a kid and we were in a big meeting with a bunch of leadership from forming to engineers
01:35:39.76 --> 01:35:42.64 All in the same room a bunch of great guys from a great company and
01:35:43.52 --> 01:35:46.16 You want to the young engineers raised his hand and said, you know, I'm
01:35:46.80 --> 01:35:50.16 Young and I am going to be in charge of these guys
01:35:51.68 --> 01:35:55.60 You know, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with these guys that've been doing it for a while longer. What can I do to?
01:35:56.32 --> 01:35:58.32 You know gain their respect
01:35:58.96 --> 01:36:00.96 And I said okay
01:36:00.96 --> 01:36:07.76 Who in this room knows more than that engineer back there about construction and all these salty
01:36:07.76 --> 01:36:14.08 Construction for men's raised their hands and I said who you know who's good think that this guy's got the best idea
01:36:14.08 --> 01:36:18.16 Raise your hands all the hands go down and I said so this is what you're dealing with buddy
01:36:19.68 --> 01:36:21.68 I said now let me ask another question the group
01:36:22.72 --> 01:36:23.52 group
01:36:23.52 --> 01:36:27.20 If this kid comes in and says I know how to do this better than you
01:36:27.20 --> 01:36:32.48 Listen to me and do it my way who's going to have respect for him raise your hand no hands go up
01:36:34.08 --> 01:36:36.24 If this young kid comes in and says hey
01:36:37.04 --> 01:36:40.000 I'm an engineer I've been educated but I haven't been doing this for long
01:36:40.72 --> 01:36:46.80 Can you give me some recommendations on how we do this so we can do the best job possible who's gonna have respect for everyone raises their hand?
01:36:47.52 --> 01:36:49.52 So there you have it
01:36:49.52 --> 01:36:54.96 You you don't have to know everything as a leader no one expects you know everything especially as a young leader
01:36:54.96 --> 01:37:01.44 That's okay and actually when you admit that you actually gain respect when you ask for people is input
01:37:01.44 --> 01:37:05.76 You actually gain respect people get the paranoid feeling that if they don't know something
01:37:06.08 --> 01:37:09.04 They're gonna be seen as weak. It's not true. So
01:37:10.72 --> 01:37:12.40 You can just
01:37:12.40 --> 01:37:17.44 Step up into the position still be humble still take advice now. This doesn't mean that you're a pushover
01:37:18.24 --> 01:37:20.80 Right, this doesn't mean that you just
01:37:20.80 --> 01:37:27.12 Listen to what everyone says you don't make any decisions. No, but it actually means that you show respect to their experience and when it comes time to make a decision
01:37:27.28 --> 01:37:33.04 You get the best input and then you make a decision and you explain your decision and if your decision is wrong you admit it and if it's not wrong you push forward
01:37:34.56 --> 01:37:39.12 So that's what you need to do you're getting asked to be put in this position for a reason so do it
01:37:39.76 --> 01:37:41.76 Get some
01:37:41.76 --> 01:37:43.28 Seems like a common one yeah
01:37:43.28 --> 01:37:46.64 Don't I'm stepping in the new role for sure everyone asked that question
01:37:46.64 --> 01:37:52.32 Yeah, man. That's what it again. There you go for everyone's benefit. Could my own yeah, I learn from it every time no
01:37:52.40 --> 01:37:55.28 That's the ethos right going humble. Yeah
01:37:56.08 --> 01:38:01.04 Be open minded take advice. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Don't have to know everything. Yes
01:38:03.52 --> 01:38:05.52 Three days ago
01:38:05.84 --> 01:38:07.20 Our neighbor
01:38:07.20 --> 01:38:08.16 Young girl
01:38:08.16 --> 01:38:10.40 One of my daughters friends 12 years old
01:38:11.36 --> 01:38:13.36 It comes over their mess in around their swimming
01:38:13.36 --> 01:38:15.36 I mean
01:38:15.36 --> 01:38:18.08 She grabs my daughters jump rope and she's jumping rope
01:38:18.80 --> 01:38:24.56 She does the cross you know you jump rope being across crossover whatever crossover. Yeah, yeah, so she does that and man
01:38:24.56 --> 01:38:26.56 I used to jump rope back in the day, but
01:38:27.28 --> 01:38:29.44 I never really could do the crossover. Let's face it
01:38:30.32 --> 01:38:31.92 Nonetheless, so she's jumping rope in and
01:38:32.56 --> 01:38:37.28 Jumping rope and I'm like hey do that cross the crossover thing again. She does it
01:38:37.28 --> 01:38:42.80 She's doing you know she's 12 years old. You thought I'm like dang I never could do that and she's like well you just got to do it like this until it's something like
01:38:42.80 --> 01:38:49.12 Okay, I grab the rope and I try and the ropes do small so I go grab my rope. Yeah, I got a jump rope
01:38:49.92 --> 01:38:56.64 Tell my daughter grab it so she grabs it and this is like a kind of like one of those pro speed ropes, you know, so it's like kind of
01:38:57.12 --> 01:39:00.88 So if I make a mistake on this rope is gonna hurt. I didn't have any shoes. I was barefoot
01:39:01.52 --> 01:39:10.72 So I'm so Hawaiian self for sure 100% and then so I go for it. I'm jumping right can jump rope still pretty good right now still I haven't done it a while and
01:39:10.72 --> 01:39:17.44 She goes okay, so right here at the top, you know you you cross you this is where you want to cross at the top
01:39:17.44 --> 01:39:21.52 I try oh hits my foot painful and she's like no you gotta do it. She's gonna time
01:39:23.20 --> 01:39:28.80 No, okay, no, no never show the pain to the kids. I try not to anyway, so I was like okay boom
01:39:29.52 --> 01:39:33.52 Fail she's like no more at the top, you know, it'll it'll just whatever
01:39:34.32 --> 01:39:39.92 So I'm like okay, I do it and it took me four times on my fourth time I did it for the first time in my life by the way
01:39:39.92 --> 01:39:41.92 They're crossover
01:39:42.08 --> 01:39:46.08 With the painful speed rope. Mm-hmm, you know some mental fortitude right there
01:39:46.56 --> 01:39:49.92 thrown in so hard car. I did it you should have seen
01:39:52.24 --> 01:39:57.52 But you should have seen the look on her and my daughter's face they were like like it was you know
01:39:57.52 --> 01:40:00.64 Like I just got my purple belt or something nonetheless
01:40:01.60 --> 01:40:05.44 So boom, what do we have right there a situation this is what I took from it to
01:40:05.44 --> 01:40:12.000 We have a situation a full grown athletic arguably person
01:40:12.96 --> 01:40:17.92 Learning to do something that's really not that easy obviously if I've never done it in my life
01:40:19.52 --> 01:40:25.60 Learning to do something that takes a fair amount of skill from a 12 year old girl in real time
01:40:28.56 --> 01:40:30.56 And you know what I did
01:40:30.56 --> 01:40:36.88 To boot gave her the credit. I said dang you are the best you have to go into the monster
01:40:37.76 --> 01:40:41.60 Yes, I could that great so that's the thing you're still on the moral of your story
01:40:41.76 --> 01:40:43.44 Which was a long story. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
01:40:43.92 --> 01:40:47.68 Be humble you can learn from anybody. Yes, and when you do learn from someone give me the grab
01:40:47.68 --> 01:40:51.12 Boom, that's what I did so you guys said that in 13 seconds. I know Brad
01:40:51.12 --> 01:40:54.16 But I'm just saying it was impactful and it reminded me of that story
01:40:54.72 --> 01:40:56.24 Anyway next question
01:40:56.24 --> 01:41:02.32 Joko just check out podcast 21 with Tim Kennedy awesome. There is a big time question though
01:41:02.32 --> 01:41:06.80 You and Tim agreed that cops who make controversial decisions slash mistakes
01:41:07.28 --> 01:41:10.24 Do so simply because they're not trained well enough
01:41:10.64 --> 01:41:15.84 That big's a question how much does the environment someone trains in impact their decision making
01:41:16.40 --> 01:41:19.76 How much tactical decision making is in eight versus learned
01:41:19.76 --> 01:41:26.88 Could killing the ideology that that the insurgents buy into be better than killing insurgents
01:41:27.76 --> 01:41:31.92 Or can they simply not be reasoned with at any level?
01:41:32.80 --> 01:41:38.000 There have been terrorists who flee their organizations and start new peaceful lives in other locations
01:41:39.76 --> 01:41:43.84 Okay, yes, so the first part of the question yes you train how you fight
01:41:43.84 --> 01:41:49.76 And the more you train the more you reprogram your instincts so that's important
01:41:50.32 --> 01:41:54.40 Your reprogram your instincts when you train and you get better instincts
01:41:55.04 --> 01:41:57.04 So that's
01:41:57.20 --> 01:42:01.04 What you do and and now when cops make mistakes
01:42:01.92 --> 01:42:08.24 Oftentimes it's because of their lack of training sometimes they make a mistake
01:42:08.24 --> 01:42:14.80 That is a mistake that got made you know, it's it's a mistake that's all it is and they've been trained well
01:42:14.80 --> 01:42:20.96 And they still make a mistake. I'm gonna tell you the percentage of mistakes go down dramatically the more that you train and the more
01:42:20.96 --> 01:42:25.28 Realistically trained and the more often you train you're gonna get better no doubt about it
01:42:25.60 --> 01:42:31.52 But that's like an instinct you're training your instinct so that's the one thing this this
01:42:31.52 --> 01:42:45.60 Idea that we could just attack an ideology of terrorists and then have some of them convert that be a wonderful thing that you attack the ideology and then some of them become peaceful productive members of society
01:42:47.04 --> 01:42:51.04 And if we did like a full court press to try and make this happen we might be able to convert
01:42:52.24 --> 01:42:54.48 Let's say we were really successful. We may be able to convert
01:42:54.96 --> 01:42:56.96 5 or 10 percent a year
01:42:56.96 --> 01:43:07.52 Okay, so that's great. The nefter remember that the enemy is also out there converting people right probably at at least equal rate
01:43:08.32 --> 01:43:10.32 Maybe even a little bit higher
01:43:11.04 --> 01:43:12.56 So
01:43:12.56 --> 01:43:18.000 We still end up losing the fight because to break even is to lose because there's still out there doing what they're doing the
01:43:18.56 --> 01:43:20.56 um
01:43:20.56 --> 01:43:22.56 And in the meantime by the way, they're still
01:43:22.56 --> 01:43:26.72 Gaining territory or causing terror
01:43:27.28 --> 01:43:34.48 So it's not a good situation now the examples that I use all the time obviously are not he Germany and Imperial Japan
01:43:34.96 --> 01:43:40.48 Both of those groups were like the current day geologists
01:43:41.44 --> 01:43:43.44 They were looking to take over the world and
01:43:44.16 --> 01:43:47.84 If we just tried to kill their ideas with our ideas
01:43:47.84 --> 01:43:54.32 We would be speaking German right now because we would not we couldn't have changed their ideas
01:43:54.96 --> 01:44:01.60 Fast enough and and by the way they were playing a different game if we were playing the game of let's change ideas
01:44:02.96 --> 01:44:05.52 The enemy is playing a different game so for instance
01:44:06.48 --> 01:44:08.96 If someone is trying to assault you and
01:44:10.16 --> 01:44:12.16 You're a pacifist
01:44:12.16 --> 01:44:18.000 And so you decide that you're gonna try and convince them of the virtues of non violence through through
01:44:18.24 --> 01:44:26.48 Debate and theocratic method and critical analysis and the use of various rhetorical devices and that's what you're gonna do and you might be the best
01:44:26.48 --> 01:44:28.48 The better in the entire world
01:44:30.16 --> 01:44:33.36 But none of those things are gonna stop that assault or from punching you in the face
01:44:33.76 --> 01:44:38.72 He's playing a different game and once you're on the ground, he's gonna start kicking you. He's a violent person
01:44:38.72 --> 01:44:45.44 Now maybe if you were to be able to slow him how long enough to try and reason with him. He's not playing that game though
01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.72 He's there to attack you. Is there to stab you?
01:44:49.68 --> 01:44:56.32 So your ideas aren't gonna defeat his ideas. You don't have the opportunity to do that. He's not playing
01:44:57.44 --> 01:44:59.44 Debate
01:44:59.44 --> 01:45:05.60 So you have to know how to fight you have to understand a violence and you have to be prepared to use it
01:45:05.60 --> 01:45:10.32 And if you can if you can debate and you can win that's awesome
01:45:12.08 --> 01:45:14.08 That's awesome, but if it doesn't work
01:45:15.12 --> 01:45:21.44 You need to be prepared to use violence as it's needed and that's the same thing on a larger scale obviously
01:45:22.72 --> 01:45:27.04 We we can do everything we can to try and help snuff out this extremist ideology
01:45:27.84 --> 01:45:28.88 Let's
01:45:28.88 --> 01:45:37.12 Prop up reformist as much as we can. Let's try and bring economic opportunities to these in proberist and and deprived regions
01:45:37.52 --> 01:45:43.44 So that they're less likely to come under the psychological grips of a death cult
01:45:46.24 --> 01:45:51.12 But at the same time that we're doing those procedures. Let's attack their strongest factories of hate
01:45:52.40 --> 01:45:56.80 Let's go after their centers of gravity and let's snuff out and destroy those
01:45:56.80 --> 01:46:00.96 Individuals that clearly have no hope of reform and exist
01:46:02.24 --> 01:46:04.24 Only to spread
01:46:05.28 --> 01:46:09.92 This cancer of hate and violence and terror and death
01:46:13.36 --> 01:46:16.40 And if we attack on both those of fronts
01:46:17.92 --> 01:46:21.92 Hopefully one day where we can live in a world
01:46:22.88 --> 01:46:24.88 Where we can solve problems
01:46:24.88 --> 01:46:31.36 Not with physical force, but with our intellectual power and that would be great
01:46:33.12 --> 01:46:34.96 And unfortunately, I don't think that they will ever come
01:46:35.76 --> 01:46:38.24 Because there's always going to be someone out there
01:46:39.12 --> 01:46:41.12 That's going to attack you
01:46:41.12 --> 01:46:43.36 Regardless of your debating skills
01:46:43.36 --> 01:46:45.36 Yeah
01:46:51.36 --> 01:46:54.96 Next question yeah long question here yeah
01:46:57.36 --> 01:47:02.24 My general question is is there a point where it's no longer physically realistic to train
01:47:02.24 --> 01:47:06.40 You jitsu big jitsu today on the podcast. Yeah, jitsu. Have you jitsu today? Yeah, yeah
01:47:07.12 --> 01:47:10.96 I'm a fan and actually I noticed we were going back as you jitsu a lot. Yeah, yeah
01:47:10.96 --> 01:47:16.48 Wait, we took some questions. I warned about jitsu yeah, we turned a minute jitsu questions jitsu. Sometimes
01:47:19.44 --> 01:47:25.36 I'm a former competitive athlete but have experienced various injuries that I still work through on a daily basis
01:47:25.36 --> 01:47:31.12 I really want to get into jitsu, but my only hesitations are my lingering injuries. I don't know anyone who trains
01:47:31.84 --> 01:47:37.04 So I don't have any sense of how much is too much when it comes to physical limitations and injuries
01:47:37.04 --> 01:47:40.16 I'm sure you must have had injuries over the years that hindered your training
01:47:41.68 --> 01:47:44.64 Were you able to modify your training to accommodate them them?
01:47:45.68 --> 01:47:55.04 Although I have no experience I greatly respect the martial arts and the last thing that I would want to do is waste the instructor or other students time by not being able to fully participate
01:47:55.36 --> 01:48:01.28 And or holding up the class. I hope this question can benefit other podcast listeners who may be wondering the same thing
01:48:01.28 --> 01:48:08.88 However to give you the give you full detail in reference to the question. I'm 26 and the injuries I'm dealing with are
01:48:10.32 --> 01:48:11.52 Is the list
01:48:11.52 --> 01:48:16.08 Left knee that I need to work on daily to maintain full range of motion on my third ACL
01:48:16.96 --> 01:48:18.56 Meaning he had surgery three times
01:48:18.56 --> 01:48:24.24 Hmm well, yeah, he's had three actually said he had heard surgery seven times, but that's his third ACL
01:48:24.24 --> 01:48:27.36 Oh ACL still. Oh yeah third ligament been put in there
01:48:27.36 --> 01:48:32.56 Dang yeah because they replaced the ligament because it doesn't grow back and it doesn't heal so they got to give you a cadaver or they
01:48:32.56 --> 01:48:37.16 If you give you your own from your hip or your yeah from your hip or hamstring or
01:48:37.16 --> 01:48:42.56 Or how string and they put that in there or they give you a cadaver one. Yeah. I had that I had ACL
01:48:43.04 --> 01:48:50.72 Back in the cadaver my own from my hamstring. Okay. I've had sage seven surge. Well, I haven't this back to the question

01:48:59.20 --> 01:49:04.48 There you go. I'm told one more major injury to the joint and I'm looking at a full knee replacement

01:49:28.40 --> 01:49:30.40 No, he says but all cutting sports
01:49:31.28 --> 01:49:36.32 Are pretty much meeting cutting you know you know when you cut on the field. Oh cutting gotcha
01:49:36.32 --> 01:49:40.16 Okay cutting left cutting right I'm pretty sure that's what he means. Okay. Yeah, I thought he meant
01:49:40.16 --> 01:49:43.68 Yeah, because he power elastic on jog you can do mac cons, but he can't cut gotcha
01:49:43.68 --> 01:49:46.80 Characca either way. I get I got you
01:49:47.68 --> 01:49:50.80 Sports are pretty much other question if you get so isn't feasible
01:49:50.80 --> 01:49:57.20 Do you recommend any other martial art that would better fit my situation just getting tired of only trying trying to stay
01:49:57.36 --> 01:50:00.64 Physically fit and would rather incorporate a beneficial skill into my training
01:50:01.36 --> 01:50:05.28 Or is this all in my head and I should stop worrying and just get after it
01:50:05.28 --> 01:50:08.88 Thank you for any advice. You can offer a podcast. Thank you for your service. All right. Awesome
01:50:08.88 --> 01:50:17.04 So I'm I kind of broke these out. Let me let me break these out here. So his first general question is there a point where there's no longer physically realistic to train to jits or
01:50:17.28 --> 01:50:24.08 The answer that really is yes, but you can also train jits who in a wide variety of levels of intensity
01:50:24.48 --> 01:50:28.000 Very wide you could theoretically just go and learn the techniques
01:50:28.24 --> 01:50:32.32 Yeah, you could just learn the techniques and never actually roll to someone and
01:50:33.36 --> 01:50:35.36 If you couldn't do anything at all
01:50:35.36 --> 01:50:41.20 That would in my opinion I would still do that yeah, just to just to know and understand it
01:50:41.20 --> 01:50:48.48 I would still do that. Yeah, would you agree yes and it now what you have to be watch out for
01:50:49.36 --> 01:50:53.28 Is that you're gonna want to try him yeah, you're gonna want to try him in so unreal
01:50:53.28 --> 01:50:56.96 And that's just that's what you're gonna need want to do now
01:50:57.52 --> 01:51:03.04 You know like I said you can do it from just from just learning the techniques only to all the way to competing in jits
01:51:03.04 --> 01:51:07.68 You and like I said you got to watch out that you if you can only learn them and
01:51:08.56 --> 01:51:15.04 Maybe you can roll light maybe you can find you can roll with light people or you can roll with really good
01:51:16.56 --> 01:51:21.04 Brown belts that are light and that that you tell them you know up front hey
01:51:21.04 --> 01:51:24.56 I got injuries. I'm not here to furno you go trip. I just want to try the moves
01:51:25.28 --> 01:51:29.12 You better freaking keep your ego in check though, which is what's so hard
01:51:29.12 --> 01:51:32.72 Because you're gonna think well this guy's kind of skinny. I think I could do this right now
01:51:32.72 --> 01:51:36.000 I think I get out of this and then you end up getting hurt. Yeah, you can't let that happen
01:51:36.32 --> 01:51:41.04 So don't let your ego get in the way you might not want if you have all those serious injuries like it sounds like you have
01:51:41.04 --> 01:51:45.12 You may not want to roll with anybody for a long time until you really truly understand
01:51:45.84 --> 01:51:52.08 Jiu Jitsu so that's question number one. Yes. You can learn it without much risk actually
01:51:53.28 --> 01:51:57.92 You're very limited risk if you're just looking to learn the techniques you could learn it with very limited risk
01:51:57.92 --> 01:52:00.40 Now the next question
01:52:01.68 --> 01:52:07.84 Have I had injuries over the years and was I able to modify my training to accommodate them? Absolutely. Yeah, I've had
01:52:08.32 --> 01:52:14.32 ankle you know spraying ankles high sprains all that stuff and when that happens you see me training my bottom game of bunch
01:52:14.32 --> 01:52:19.52 Because I'm not gonna be on top. I hurt my back one time really bad and I couldn't do an oompa
01:52:19.68 --> 01:52:23.44 This is what I was a blue belt couldn't do an oompa couldn't do it guess what I did
01:52:23.44 --> 01:52:28.80 Elbowscape my elbowscape got good because I could not do an oompa. I've had my
01:52:29.76 --> 01:52:31.12 MCL
01:52:31.12 --> 01:52:38.56 80% tear get some guess what no factor put on and I I couldn't train for like a couple weeks, but then I put on one of those hinged
01:52:38.80 --> 01:52:44.88 Metal braces strap that thing on tight could I do clothes guard? No could I do a triangle on someone? No
01:52:44.96 --> 01:52:48.24 Did I have to be careful? Yes, did I train? Absolutely
01:52:48.24 --> 01:52:52.96 My neck I had neck surgery and you know my neck now
01:52:53.68 --> 01:52:57.36 Doesn't hurt yeah, though I and my whole game
01:52:59.12 --> 01:53:06.64 Is kind of based fundamentally around protecting my neck so I don't do certain moves that I used to do that were that are high risk neck moves
01:53:07.20 --> 01:53:09.20 Right like
01:53:10.24 --> 01:53:15.84 Yeah, there's just certain moves that I just don't do anymore because it's high risk neck move and I don't want to put my neck into just into
01:53:15.84 --> 01:53:22.16 Jeopardy so yes you do go through things now occasionally like I just got through a
01:53:23.68 --> 01:53:25.68 Few weeks
01:53:25.68 --> 01:53:29.36 Where I had three simultaneous injuries and
01:53:30.40 --> 01:53:33.04 It was a broken knuckle
01:53:34.96 --> 01:53:36.64 Some kind of a knee
01:53:36.64 --> 01:53:40.96 Issue and I had a gaping cut on my toe
01:53:40.96 --> 01:53:47.20 My big toe ripped half the skin off the bottom of my toe and so I said to myself
01:53:47.92 --> 01:53:53.20 Okay, I'll just tape up my entire body and still train no, I didn't say that. I said you know what this is you know
01:53:53.92 --> 01:53:55.92 My body telling me
01:53:55.92 --> 01:53:57.92 You know one injury you can get through
01:53:58.16 --> 01:54:04.000 Two injuries okay wait a second, but when I finally tore my toe open I was like okay
01:54:04.24 --> 01:54:10.32 Maybe it's time to take like some time away from the map so I didn't train for a few weeks
01:54:10.32 --> 01:54:13.36 Right probably the longest I haven't trained in it since I can't remember
01:54:14.16 --> 01:54:19.84 But that's three injuries stacked on top of one another and now I'm just thinking myself you got to be kidding me
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000 Let them all heal and that's what I did
01:54:22.72 --> 01:54:24.24 So
01:54:24.24 --> 01:54:26.24 That's that the next sort of
01:54:26.96 --> 01:54:32.32 Question was if Jitu isn't feasible do you recommend any other martial art that would be better fit your situation?
01:54:32.32 --> 01:54:35.76 I think you can always learn Jitu. I think you could learn the box
01:54:35.76 --> 01:54:40.80 You could learn a lot of you gotta be careful careful with my type you got the knee surgeries
01:54:41.20 --> 01:54:44.24 You got I would say little and no sparring since you've had concussions
01:54:45.36 --> 01:54:49.92 And like I said in all those cases you can learn the box you're like well, I think I want to try this out
01:54:49.92 --> 01:54:52.72 Man, it looks pretty easy and that's partying right I'm gonna get in there
01:54:53.92 --> 01:54:55.92 Don't you've already have concussions
01:54:57.04 --> 01:54:59.44 You can't you gotta keep your ego in check and
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.36 Then the last part of the question was or is this all in my head and I should just stop worrying and
01:55:05.36 --> 01:55:11.20 Get after it look we all have got to know our limitations you got to also know that sometimes you're putting
01:55:11.60 --> 01:55:13.60 Limitations on yourself that are too tight
01:55:14.96 --> 01:55:20.80 And you also got to realize it sometimes you can push yourself too hard and overdo it and end up in a really rough spot
01:55:21.20 --> 01:55:25.44 Where you got a permanent injury like you know right my my knee is not fully healed
01:55:26.64 --> 01:55:30.08 And so instead of doing nine rounds of Jitu
01:55:30.08 --> 01:55:36.80 I did like four yesterday five yesterday five today you know not and and
01:55:37.20 --> 01:55:40.96 Avoiding a couple positions right you know that's what I'm doing yeah, that's okay
01:55:40.96 --> 01:55:44.96 I can't go in there. It can't have the big ego and be the coming to be all top right now
01:55:44.96 --> 01:55:46.96 No, yeah, yeah, and
01:55:47.12 --> 01:55:51.28 And the more impactful part is and can't have the big ego if like somebody comes up with a Kayla's role
01:55:51.84 --> 01:55:56.24 Like okay, I'll roll with you cuz I don't want to look like a was yeah, no, I'm actually I got an injured knee
01:55:56.24 --> 01:56:03.68 Can't roll right now which I hate saying yeah, I get spying that I just spying that I just spies it
01:56:04.40 --> 01:56:10.16 But I know that you know I got to heal up yeah, man, so part of the game
01:56:11.04 --> 01:56:16.96 Yeah, that's the thing going check remember Jerry loud in ever yeah, so he had jammed up knees
01:56:16.96 --> 01:56:21.28 And I thought of him you know well um you know reading this guy's question
01:56:22.32 --> 01:56:25.12 Same age maybe I don't know do you have might have been older
01:56:25.12 --> 01:56:28.40 Me, yeah, maybe like 32 or something yeah, so jammed up knees
01:56:28.96 --> 01:56:34.24 But you know he did so guys so he comes in and what he'd always do is he'd be like hey
01:56:34.24 --> 01:56:39.52 Let's he'd grab me cuz I've known him long time roll him into he'd be like hey, let's he what he called it
01:56:39.52 --> 01:56:42.64 He's like hey, do you want to play meaning like which we're just rolling?
01:56:43.44 --> 01:56:47.84 You know just like how you said like you like how I warm up with Andy yeah again exactly
01:56:47.92 --> 01:56:51.44 Yeah, he's really good for that. Yeah, now Dean is not good for that
01:56:51.44 --> 01:56:55.44 Okay, yes, so the roll Dean will literally say to me hey, let's just get warmed up
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.44 And then he'll get across side and smash me for for four minutes and 38 seconds
01:56:59.44 --> 01:57:04.56 Yeah, yeah, and we did torture me. Yeah, so I do not do warm-up rounds with Dean. Yeah, I mean
01:57:05.04 --> 01:57:07.04 You can go to hell. No one around you here
01:57:07.92 --> 01:57:15.20 Obviously Dean does that I'm purpose. Oh, for sure if like because we do that you we do that Dean has two advantages number one
01:57:16.16 --> 01:57:18.16 I'm not warm
01:57:18.16 --> 01:57:26.80 And that means there's no sweat yet, so he's so there's there's like just friction and he can just secure positions and it sucks
01:57:27.84 --> 01:57:33.20 And and psychologically we both know and the other the other advantage that he has is he's fresh
01:57:33.68 --> 01:57:36.48 Because the deeper we go into deep waters the better I'm doing
01:57:37.12 --> 01:57:39.52 Because I'm in better condition than him. I think it
01:57:39.76 --> 01:57:43.36 But he has those two advantages out of the gate. Oh, he's gonna make me pay
01:57:43.36 --> 01:57:49.36 It's so flutter you can tell. Oh, it's not like a little thing for you thing. You get 20 something you're thing with Dean
01:57:49.68 --> 01:57:53.84 Hey man, I dig it and that's probably gonna continue to you know till you guys are both
01:57:53.84 --> 01:57:58.96 Yeah, I'll just add an incident yesterday. Yeah, man. Incident yesterday happened. You know
01:58:00.24 --> 01:58:05.28 Talk about it. No, I already thought that I don't know words work changed loudly in the gym anyway
01:58:06.56 --> 01:58:10.88 Jerry is really good with that where this is a guy in this guy situation
01:58:10.88 --> 01:58:14.56 More or less knee-wise anyway, and I think he was even both his knees
01:58:14.96 --> 01:58:20.08 So you know, so you can do that and you can get like a good movement good rolling
01:58:21.28 --> 01:58:25.92 Without that impact you know when everyone's in all you got to turn up the heat or whatever on a guy
01:58:25.92 --> 01:58:31.04 Because that comes from ego. Yeah, it's more of like this competitive kind of spirit of rolling
01:58:31.04 --> 01:58:35.52 Juditis. That's kind of what it is so if you can avoid that you got to actively avoid it and
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.24 Still get that movement if you can find the right person and you can go and you can go
01:58:40.24 --> 01:58:46.72 You can learn you can get more or less live situations, but you just can't be like you can't find that little fight in the fight
01:58:46.72 --> 01:58:48.72 You know, get to let that go
01:58:48.72 --> 01:58:52.000 Can't get crazy. But yeah, you can learn for sure you can learn yeah
01:58:52.88 --> 01:58:56.40 Don't do take down if you got a knee situation. Don't do take down take down
01:58:56.64 --> 01:58:58.64 situation. That's that's gonna be hard
01:58:59.20 --> 01:59:01.20 Check
01:59:01.20 --> 01:59:03.20 All right, okay last question
01:59:04.24 --> 01:59:06.000 You know this this last question
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:12.32 It's not really a question well it look I get a lot of awesome
01:59:13.04 --> 01:59:19.12 emails and I get emails from people that have completely turned
01:59:20.80 --> 01:59:23.36 Their lives around they've they've lost weight
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:31.28 If they need to lose weight or they've gained weight because they need to gain weight or they've gotten promoted or they've become a better parent
01:59:31.28 --> 01:59:35.84 Or they become a better spouse or they become a better kid yeah
01:59:38.08 --> 01:59:44.64 And I get emails from people that have quit their addictions or they've or they've overcome their fear
01:59:45.52 --> 01:59:47.76 And I say what I get
01:59:48.80 --> 01:59:53.28 Lenders and and packages and notes about all this kind of stuff
01:59:53.68 --> 01:59:56.56 Then it's awesome. I get I get people send me books
01:59:56.56 --> 02:00:03.44 For the podcast and pictures and drawings and and military
02:00:04.16 --> 02:00:07.52 memorabilia or unit patches and coins
02:00:09.04 --> 02:00:13.92 From you know police departments and fire departments and military units is just
02:00:16.48 --> 02:00:19.84 It's awesome and and I'm
02:00:21.12 --> 02:00:23.76 So thankful for all that feedback
02:00:23.76 --> 02:00:25.76 And
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000 It drives me
02:00:28.64 --> 02:00:33.36 That feedback that I get drives me to work hard and
02:00:34.40 --> 02:00:36.40 Keep pushing
02:00:37.12 --> 02:00:40.48 To do this to the best of my ability and try and get better at it
02:00:44.24 --> 02:00:46.24 But
02:00:47.04 --> 02:00:50.08 You know I hear from people that have used
02:00:50.08 --> 02:00:54.24 The podcast and the discipline and the the
02:00:55.76 --> 02:00:57.76 mindset of looking at things
02:00:59.04 --> 02:01:01.04 That are problematic as being good
02:01:02.48 --> 02:01:06.24 I hear from people that have used those things to overcome
02:01:08.88 --> 02:01:13.28 You know dark patches yeah in their lives. No whether it's depression or
02:01:14.56 --> 02:01:17.76 anxiety or even like full-fledged despair
02:01:17.76 --> 02:01:24.32 And again when you hear from people that are turned that corner that's
02:01:25.60 --> 02:01:27.60 Just incredibly rewarding
02:01:29.68 --> 02:01:36.16 To know that there's you know there's people out there that are really changing for the better and turning their lives from
02:01:37.44 --> 02:01:39.44 negative
02:01:39.68 --> 02:01:41.68 to positive
02:01:41.68 --> 02:01:43.04 It's
02:01:43.04 --> 02:01:45.04 unbelievably
02:01:45.04 --> 02:01:47.04 rewarding
02:01:49.44 --> 02:01:51.44 But I also get
02:01:52.16 --> 02:01:55.04 Some other emails and I get some other
02:01:55.92 --> 02:01:57.92 messages
02:01:58.56 --> 02:02:01.68 From people that haven't been able
02:02:04.08 --> 02:02:06.08 to dig out of that
02:02:06.08 --> 02:02:08.72 whole to overcome that
02:02:10.16 --> 02:02:12.16 That despair
02:02:12.16 --> 02:02:14.16 I
02:02:14.16 --> 02:02:19.44 Hear from people sometimes that feel there's nowhere nowhere else to go there's no way out
02:02:21.28 --> 02:02:23.28 And they don't have any more options
02:02:26.48 --> 02:02:28.48 And they are
02:02:29.28 --> 02:02:31.28 considering
02:02:31.28 --> 02:02:41.84 Taking the only way out that they can see and that is they want to take their own life
02:02:46.08 --> 02:02:48.08 And
02:02:50.88 --> 02:02:54.32 To anybody out there that's in that place
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000 You know
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000 I
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000 Don't really know what exactly
02:03:05.04 --> 02:03:07.04 to tell you
02:03:08.80 --> 02:03:10.80 But I can kind of tell you
02:03:12.24 --> 02:03:14.24 What I think
02:03:17.52 --> 02:03:19.52 I think no
02:03:19.52 --> 02:03:27.52 I
02:03:27.52 --> 02:03:29.12 Think no I think don't save that last bullet for yourself
02:03:30.88 --> 02:03:35.44 Don't save it for yourself you lock and load that last bullet
02:03:36.40 --> 02:03:38.40 And you shoot it at your enemy
02:03:40.72 --> 02:03:44.56 And when you're out of bullets get out your knife and attack with that
02:03:44.56 --> 02:03:46.56 And
02:03:47.68 --> 02:03:50.56 If you lose your knife you grab
02:03:51.84 --> 02:03:54.80 Your enemy by the throat and you keep fighting
02:03:57.04 --> 02:04:03.12 And you keep fighting and you keep fighting and you keep fighting no matter what
02:04:07.44 --> 02:04:09.44 And you never quit
02:04:09.44 --> 02:04:14.72 Never never quit
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:23.28 And if you feel like your life isn't a place where you can't get any lower
02:04:25.68 --> 02:04:27.68 And you don't think
02:04:28.48 --> 02:04:30.48 You can find any way out
02:04:32.48 --> 02:04:34.48 Good
02:04:34.48 --> 02:04:42.16 Because that means the ultimate challenge is a head of you. It means you can only go up
02:04:46.88 --> 02:04:48.88 And it also means
02:04:49.20 --> 02:04:51.20 That things are gonna be tough
02:04:53.68 --> 02:04:55.68 Things are gonna be
02:04:55.68 --> 02:04:58.80 tougher than anything you can imagine but
02:04:58.80 --> 02:05:04.16 That storm that you're in from from your perspective
02:05:06.80 --> 02:05:08.80 It seems like that storm is
02:05:09.60 --> 02:05:11.60 Inveloping the whole world
02:05:15.20 --> 02:05:17.84 But I'm telling you it is not
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.20 The storm that you're in it is hard to see out of that storm
02:05:27.20 --> 02:05:30.000 It's hard to see past it it seems like the storm
02:05:30.72 --> 02:05:32.72 It seems like the storm is everything
02:05:37.28 --> 02:05:39.76 But the storm is not everything
02:05:42.72 --> 02:05:45.36 And it won't last forever
02:05:50.48 --> 02:05:56.56 You can get out of the storm and you will get out of the storm
02:05:56.56 --> 02:05:58.56 And when you get out
02:06:02.96 --> 02:06:06.16 You're gonna see this on again
02:06:11.28 --> 02:06:14.24 But right now you're being tried
02:06:14.24 --> 02:06:25.52 You're being forged you're being tested by fire and by pain
02:06:28.48 --> 02:06:30.48 That's the test
02:06:34.40 --> 02:06:36.64 Don't fail the test
02:06:38.80 --> 02:06:41.12 Don't fail the test don't
02:06:41.12 --> 02:06:44.56 Given don't quit
02:06:48.80 --> 02:06:50.80 Don't ever quit
02:06:51.92 --> 02:06:53.92 Fight on
02:06:54.56 --> 02:06:56.56 Fight through the storm
02:06:58.08 --> 02:07:02.64 Fight through the pain and come out the other side stronger
02:07:02.64 --> 02:07:11.36 and tougher and better
02:07:13.20 --> 02:07:14.88 A fighter
02:07:17.28 --> 02:07:19.28 A survivor
02:07:21.68 --> 02:07:23.68 A winner
02:07:27.92 --> 02:07:29.92 Victorious
02:07:29.92 --> 02:07:31.92 And
02:07:36.08 --> 02:07:38.08 Free from that storm
02:07:41.44 --> 02:07:43.44 Free from the darkness
02:07:43.44 --> 02:07:54.40 darkness
02:07:59.84 --> 02:08:01.84 And I think that's
02:08:03.68 --> 02:08:05.68 All I've got
02:08:05.68 --> 02:08:07.68 For tonight
02:08:09.20 --> 02:08:11.20 So
02:08:11.20 --> 02:08:13.20 That's what I've got
02:08:15.28 --> 02:08:17.28 Speaking of
02:08:19.92 --> 02:08:22.24 Being stronger and being better
02:08:24.96 --> 02:08:26.96 Maybe
02:08:26.96 --> 02:08:28.48 You could tell us some ways to
02:08:30.48 --> 02:08:35.84 Make ourselves a little stronger and a little better yeah and at the same time sure possibly

02:08:59.92 --> 02:09:02.40 So I'm gonna talk about on it so
02:09:03.44 --> 02:09:06.88 Good fitness gear good stuff. I just got some full-fic
02:09:06.88 --> 02:09:09.52 Minerals. It's actually for my way
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:12.08 Nonetheless they got some good stuff for any
02:09:12.64 --> 02:09:15.92 area of getting after it that you need to to
02:09:16.48 --> 02:09:20.96 Or that you want supplementation with so remember that jump rope story I told mm-hmm
02:09:20.96 --> 02:09:22.96 Right
02:09:22.96 --> 02:09:27.84 That wasn't on it jump rope. Oh there you go. Yeah, pro speed rope. I think it's called it's like
02:09:27.84 --> 02:09:32.80 But there's a lot of technological advances in jump rope. Yeah, no, I know we were you know
02:09:32.80 --> 02:09:37.44 Yeah, I let me teach school for me. Yeah, you just be the leather hide yeah or
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.32 One of my like a rope is straight up a rope with a handle yeah and another handle at the end that's it
02:09:42.80 --> 02:09:48.40 This one is like a swivel has a thing it has a police system. I don't know maybe I don't know what it's called
02:09:48.88 --> 02:09:52.88 It's made out of this stuff. It's like yeah, it's good. It's wheels good. Anyway
02:09:53.76 --> 02:09:56.16 Yeah, that jump rope's good um also kettlebells
02:09:56.16 --> 02:10:03.68 Mm-hmm solid solid heavy heavy as you need very in weights right about one for my daughter
02:10:06.32 --> 02:10:09.44 What's the what is it the little monkey howl air so it's gone
02:10:09.44 --> 02:10:13.44 I think it's like 18 pounds or something like that she can lift it up. She can't swing it she's for everything
02:10:13.44 --> 02:10:16.88 It's all right. She's deadlifting it. Yeah, good for me be surprised man little kids
02:10:16.88 --> 02:10:21.04 Yeah, I'm actually instinct for form exactly right because they're trying to find the perfect balance
02:10:21.04 --> 02:10:26.32 So I have no choice they do off that they're just gonna fall down my son 11 months old now
02:10:26.56 --> 02:10:31.20 Start walking at straight up. You'd kind of earlier than my other like nine almost ten months
02:10:31.20 --> 02:10:33.36 You know that poor right yeah, yeah, yeah, he's gonna be also
02:10:33.36 --> 02:10:35.60 Oh, that means he's gonna be an unbelievable athlete you're set life
02:10:35.92 --> 02:10:37.44 He's forgetting ever created right now
02:10:37.44 --> 02:10:41.20 That's what everybody thinks that's what they say everybody's kid is the best kid in the world
02:10:41.44 --> 02:10:44.56 Yeah, that's what everybody thinks and by no means is that my message here
02:10:44.56 --> 02:10:51.04 But the message is you watch them do a squat to pick something up. You're like dang that's good form
02:10:51.44 --> 02:10:55.84 So my daughter she's forced to pick something the kettlebell little holler and
02:10:56.72 --> 02:11:00.88 I'm like first I'm like oh shoot. I don't know she should be picking it up. She doesn't know what she's doing
02:11:00.88 --> 02:11:04.40 She picks it up with this perfect form deadlift or my
02:11:04.40 --> 02:11:08.64 Like when my youngest daughter was like six or seven I had her deadlifting
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.28 And
02:11:11.28 --> 02:11:17.52 No, and I pushed her too hard and she was deadlifting and she like our back
02:11:18.40 --> 02:11:22.48 How old like six or seven I mean she was just doing like double bodyweight
02:11:23.04 --> 02:11:25.04 And
02:11:25.60 --> 02:11:30.48 But it was with kettlebells and so you're not going that low
02:11:30.88 --> 02:11:32.48 So it makes it a little bit easier
02:11:32.64 --> 02:11:33.84 So I thought
02:11:33.84 --> 02:11:41.20 She's deadlifting and my son was in there too and I think my other daughter we were all just getting after her and
02:11:41.76 --> 02:11:47.36 You know, so my you can do this you can do this and we're escalating weights and going heavier and heavier and finally we get to like a pretty big weight
02:11:47.36 --> 02:11:49.36 I forget what it was it might have been
02:11:49.36 --> 02:11:51.36 Might have been
02:11:51.36 --> 02:11:53.92 Well, maybe the 32 kilogram or something like
02:11:55.20 --> 02:11:59.04 So she lifts it and like right as she gets almost to the top
02:11:59.28 --> 02:12:02.40 She gets the look on her face and like her like moves sharp
02:12:02.40 --> 02:12:07.84 And then and then she like started to tear up and she dropped and she dropped and she put it back down
02:12:07.84 --> 02:12:09.44 She started to tear up and she's like
02:12:09.44 --> 02:12:13.04 I think something happened to me back daddy and I was like oh god
02:12:13.04 --> 02:12:14.64 I am the worst father ever
02:12:14.64 --> 02:12:19.04 Yeah, I think you're so don't go with heavy kettlebells for the kids or heavy deadlifting
02:12:19.04 --> 02:12:24.48 But they're not ready for it. Yeah. I'll go on record treatment and say don't buy kettlebells for you kids
02:12:24.48 --> 02:12:29.36 Yeah program that you got sorted out form in one there for or 11 months or whatever
02:12:29.36 --> 02:12:36.40 Wait to their six don't do it. I bought the kettlebell because when I go out there's a water of one
02:12:36.40 --> 02:12:41.76 My daughter deadlifting in like posted it one time people are all pumped
02:12:42.32 --> 02:12:44.88 It's pretty good and it's dope to see in a picture
02:12:44.88 --> 02:12:50.72 But man you can't get crazy with that. I think if I'm lifting my kettlebells
02:12:50.72 --> 02:12:51.52 And they're cool
02:12:51.52 --> 02:12:54.80 There's a lot of ones and you know all this stuff my daughter's out there she's cruising
02:12:54.80 --> 02:12:59.04 She's watching she's like you know obviously let me try let me try and she she wants to get
02:12:59.04 --> 02:13:03.76 The game. Yeah, I wanted to pick up that where will fit we sixty two pounds one of them oh
02:13:03.76 --> 02:13:05.76 She you don't letter
02:13:05.76 --> 02:13:07.04 I don't
02:13:07.04 --> 02:13:13.12 I don't push her to put pick that up no, she'll grab it and try and she doesn't pick it up. No, it's too heavy for
02:13:13.76 --> 02:13:18.56 And so she but she just wants to be you like dad. Yeah, that's all it is so you got to the howler
02:13:19.12 --> 02:13:24.000 Just as a little gift. You know hey you got your own kettlebell you know all empowering that is I'm not saying that now now
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:30.40 It's lift kettlebells grow your own before now you're on the pro it's not that it's for her to have her own little kettlebell and be you know
02:13:30.40 --> 02:13:34.32 It's like cohesive thing, you know, no, it's cool just like she likes to do pull ups
02:13:34.64 --> 02:13:38.56 But not really she's not on a pull-up routine. She reads where your kid I read it to her and
02:13:39.20 --> 02:13:44.48 She sees me doing pull-ups. She's like my turn. I want to do pull-ups now when she's able to get on her own program or
02:13:44.80 --> 02:13:46.80 Be more in a position to
02:13:47.04 --> 02:13:50.72 Facilitate a program impolice upon her as the case maybe
02:13:51.60 --> 02:13:53.20 Not too early by the way
02:13:53.20 --> 02:13:58.24 She'll be familiar with pull-ups. She'll know the value of pull-ups plus dad does pull-ups. So it's obviously cool
02:13:58.24 --> 02:14:03.84 Yeah, you know and she's gonna be down. She's gonna be kind of set for life in regards to pull-ups kettlebells whatever
02:14:03.84 --> 02:14:12.48 So I like it so back where can you get those oh the kettlebells yeah on it dot com or the jump rope or the jump rope still nonetheless
02:14:14.88 --> 02:14:20.24 Don't I don't think actually I do think that those designer kettlebells
02:14:20.24 --> 02:14:22.24 Mm-hmm those are kind of like the um
02:14:24.24 --> 02:14:27.84 That's the kind of the pre-meda on one actually no that one's time yeah
02:14:28.24 --> 02:14:33.28 That's a wrong one. Okay with it now. I'm okay with it. They're dope. They're just good. Yeah, you like them
02:14:33.28 --> 02:14:38.80 They're not like the hardcore dusty. Yeah cannon balls with handles. You know like artistic not the ones I have
02:14:39.04 --> 02:14:43.12 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they're not like that. I got all the design ones, but they are cool
02:14:45.12 --> 02:14:47.12 If you walk into a gym
02:14:47.12 --> 02:14:52.08 You know you go to the gym you're wherever and there's a bunch of kettlebells, right?
02:14:52.08 --> 02:14:56.64 And you're you're looking for a certain weight and let's say there's the where-wall-fones and then there's the regular ones
02:14:56.96 --> 02:14:58.96 Which ones are you gonna use
02:14:59.20 --> 02:15:00.16 Me?
02:15:00.16 --> 02:15:02.96 Is this a serious question or just like a basic question everyone?
02:15:03.36 --> 02:15:07.28 But what do you think I would use where-wall-fones probably see that's what you know
02:15:08.16 --> 02:15:12.88 Well, nonetheless, I think they're cool and go ahead check them out. They're on on it dot com slash jockel
02:15:13.12 --> 02:15:15.12 That's where you get it support yourself
02:15:15.12 --> 02:15:18.32 Really and it supports this podcast also
02:15:19.28 --> 02:15:21.44 If you're into these books we didn't read any books
02:15:23.12 --> 02:15:28.64 But I'm maybe in a few books today. Yeah, mentioned hack worth books. Yeah, right? I mentioned dick winners books
02:15:28.80 --> 02:15:33.44 Where can you find those books? Well, ultimately you get them from Amazon like everything else
02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.56 But if you want to go through the list the specific books go to the website
02:15:37.28 --> 02:15:42.000 Jockelpodcast.com section on the top or menu item on the top boom
02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.88 Please you to the page with all the books by episode by the way
02:15:45.68 --> 02:15:47.84 Actually, I don't think I put extreme ownership on there
02:15:48.32 --> 02:15:49.84 But nonetheless
02:15:49.84 --> 02:15:54.40 Click through there. That's kind of jacked up. Well actually it's a word of the right
02:15:54.72 --> 02:15:59.20 Yes, so that's the thing extreme ownership is for we never covered it in the podcast, correct
02:15:59.20 --> 02:16:04.08 So it's not gonna be on the list of books covered in the podcast because of the section is called books from the episodes
02:16:04.56 --> 02:16:08.48 Unless maybe all of life on it will do extreme ownership. Yeah, that'd be cool
02:16:09.04 --> 02:16:11.04 that'd be like layers because
02:16:11.04 --> 02:16:16.88 You wrote the book you experience all the things with the life you do the audiobook and now you're doing the podcast
02:16:17.60 --> 02:16:19.60 So it's like a good thing
02:16:19.60 --> 02:16:26.000 Anyway go to that go to jocpodcast.com boom choose whatever book or books that you want click through there to get them
02:16:26.72 --> 02:16:32.96 Boom got you. That's a good way to support. Yep. Very good. It's like gum and it's what takes what
02:16:33.52 --> 02:16:35.84 One second two seconds and big support
02:16:37.12 --> 02:16:39.12 small action big reaction
02:16:39.12 --> 02:16:41.12 Just saying
02:16:41.12 --> 02:16:42.12 Hmm
02:16:42.12 --> 02:16:46.80 You know what you know what I'm saying understand also good with support is to subscribe
02:16:47.12 --> 02:16:51.60 That's on iTunes teacher google play and all these other podcasting providing platforms
02:16:52.56 --> 02:16:54.56 Not to mention YouTube
02:16:54.56 --> 02:16:57.68 If you like the video format you want to see what jockel looks like if you don't know already
02:16:58.48 --> 02:17:01.60 You know I guess you can see what I look like which I'm not saying to look at me
02:17:02.16 --> 02:17:06.72 To look at me. I'm gonna say this if you don't know what echo looks like go look on YouTube
02:17:06.72 --> 02:17:09.76 So you can see what he looks like because he doesn't look like what you think he looks like
02:17:10.24 --> 02:17:14.24 Apparently apparently I've known him too long to understand the
02:17:14.80 --> 02:17:18.000 What he appears to be via his voice
02:17:18.80 --> 02:17:24.80 But apparently he doesn't sound like what he looks like so yeah, I guess I want to check that out. Yeah, I guess they don't match my look in my voice
02:17:24.80 --> 02:17:25.76 Yeah
02:17:25.76 --> 02:17:30.80 Apparently not but you know I live in a world where we're judged on the content over our character and the
02:17:30.80 --> 02:17:37.44 Contents of our hearts so oh I look doesn't matter quite as much as one might think but if you're a list
02:17:37.44 --> 02:17:42.72 Interested in seeing that go to you to why you're at it subscribe. That's a good way to support
02:17:43.68 --> 02:17:48.48 Plus we're gonna we do add other videos that are shorter in form
02:17:49.04 --> 02:17:55.44 We do have the video version podcast whole thing two hours three hours all ever long and echo is gonna post a video of
02:17:56.16 --> 02:17:58.16 I think it's the most I've laughed
02:17:58.16 --> 02:18:04.64 Captured on the new in history. Yeah, so I was laughing at something that that was not in the podcast
02:18:04.64 --> 02:18:06.24 We were recording
02:18:06.24 --> 02:18:12.64 Wasn't in the podcast. I laughed really hard. It was pre podcast. Yeah pre podcast record session sure
02:18:13.04 --> 02:18:17.36 And that happened so I'm looking forward to seeing that one you better get it up before this thing comes out
02:18:19.20 --> 02:18:22.24 Yeah, anyway
02:18:22.24 --> 02:18:27.60 That's a good way to support subscribe YouTube other x small excerpts on there anywhere from one minute to
02:18:28.32 --> 02:18:34.80 12 minutes was the exception you should be 211 and three minutes little blessings that you can kind of extra anyone that thinks 12 minutes is an excerpt
02:18:36.32 --> 02:18:41.36 I don't know I don't think that's right technically it is yeah. I guess it is but technically let's make them three minutes
02:18:41.36 --> 02:18:48.40 Okay, you should you should put more effort into them and and and cut them down like the real critical parts
02:18:49.20 --> 02:18:51.20 That's what I think okay

02:20:34.72 --> 02:20:39.60 We all no matter what jocco will ever say we all hit moments of weakness
02:20:39.60 --> 02:20:44.56 And just like if you're gonna max bench
02:20:45.44 --> 02:20:51.12 I know I said this from a say it again because it holds true if you're gonna go one rep max or even two
02:20:51.12 --> 02:20:55.20 Rep max whatever on bench. What about three up max three rep max as well
02:20:55.92 --> 02:21:00.08 It starts to get a little bit more safe. I think in my opinion, but let's say two rep max
02:21:00.48 --> 02:21:02.16 You're gonna have
02:21:02.16 --> 02:21:07.76 Someone there to spot you just in case you fully intend to get those two reps fully
02:21:07.76 --> 02:21:12.16 But when you're pushing it it's wise to have a spot
02:21:13.12 --> 02:21:17.84 Good for some reason maybe you didn't eat your you know a good whatever
02:21:18.40 --> 02:21:22.88 Maybe didn't get enough sleep. I don't know but you could hit a little road black little moment of weakness
02:21:22.88 --> 02:21:26.72 Yeah, that spot their boom gets you through gets you that last inch on your rep or whatever
02:21:27.28 --> 02:21:29.28 Keeps you on your path. This is
02:21:29.28 --> 02:21:34.80 The real world version of this is called psychological warfare and what that is. It's an album with tracks
02:21:34.80 --> 02:21:41.36 Jockel tracks and for any situation you might find yourself in that you have a moment of weakness like getting up in the morning or
02:21:41.60 --> 02:21:45.28 Skipping your workout when you intended to work out or slacking on your diet
02:21:47.60 --> 02:21:52.72 Jockel will be there with a track that'll help you through it. It's called psychological warfare
