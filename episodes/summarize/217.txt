well two things number one we covered her a pile on this podcast right here number 39 and if you don't know this about irney pile he was actually killed in action in the battle of okinawa and two i don't know what we can do to get the the recordings out of the library and into the interwebs but we should do that let's get them out there the the stuff that you you know again another example staff sergeant Jason Ross March 2011 during a second deployment to Afghanistan Jason lost both of his legs part of his pelvic bone where an ID exploded doctors gave him less than 2% chances survival but Jason never stopped fighting complication said in insurgents ended up needing to take more and more from his legs until eventually all his hips were gone to date he's undergone more than 240 surgeries basically the entire lower half of his body is no longer there we built a smart home for Jason and his family in San Diego when we handed over the keys to him in his ceremony his six-year-old daughter Stacy asked to speak my daddy is Jason Ross she said when i was little my daddy got hurt now Afghanistan he was in the hospital for a long time my daddy is strong and brave another thing you guys do you talk about here my my foundation's final program is called relief and resiliency outreach this is an umbrella program we simply try to help veterans and their family in any way possible including those recovering from trauma injury or loss within the umbrella is a mentoring program i've had a long relationship with a disabled american veterans d a v and no several wounded veterans who've lived with their injuries for decades so i thought of providing an opportunity to induce introduce some of our younger wounded veterans from i rack and afghanistan to veterans from previous wars i met with gym surzley the enom veteran triple amputee and former national commander of the d a v to gout to gage his interest and get his thoughts he responded positively and said he would love to be involved and that he would discuss it with the d a v leadership and if you want to know about more than more about gym surzley layers podcast 200 in here talking about his story which is which is incredible and you close this section out by saying the simple story is here that from its creation in 2011 the foundation is grown into a friendly giant we've gone from one donor just me in the beginning to a base of more than 45 thousand donors in a annual budget of nearly 30 million while we can never do enough to show our gratitude to our nation's defenders of veterans of first responders and the families who live serve alongside them and you have this little mantra, this little motto we can always do a little more and I think the idea of we can always do a little more is probably a good place to wrap even though it's not the last chapter the last chapter is actually called why i'm still on a mission and obviously there's an important message there but that also ties in with the motto we can always do a little bit more and I guess still have to buy the book to get that last and you don't have anything to worry about now you don't have to take care of the kids they're not there I've got them you focus on yourself and this issue and within a couple of days she took herself to Betty Ford clinic and checked herself in and that that's the last time she you know right before she went in there she had her final drink I had a friend who you know was had a lot of money it was very wealthy and lost his son to opioid overdose and you know he was kind of talking me through what had happened and one of the things he said to me he said you know I had unlimited resources unlimited resources I said him to every different rehab all kinds of different you know drugs psychologists therapists unlimited resources to try and get his son off of drugs and he said the only thing I do was was tough love is the term that he used which you know is what you you did here take the gloves off and I can't imagine how hard that's got to be to hold the line in those situations where you know when you're looking at your kid your wife you're looking at your kid and you're thinking and she said yes you know maybe someone struggling with this kind of thing will read it and find hope you know in it that hey maybe maybe I can overcome this particular demon myself you know during this period of time everything on the outside my career who did a damn ransom you know all these different things we're having winning awards I played Harry Truman I got that golden globe and then the sag awards and the amnes and you know all this stuff was happening there was all very positive and wonderful when everything and at home you know it was dark it was tough it was difficult we were struggling and the family was really going through some difficult things so nobody ever knew that we decided to tell that story because at a time where it looked like Gary Sunise was on the rise and all the all everything was rosy and everything we were struggling with some very serious issues at home and I got back about 11 o'clock at nine I get a phone call from the USO representative saying Tommy Franks general Tommy Franks is going up to Baghdad tomorrow he wants to take a small group of people and he wants you to come so I said absolutely so we went up to Baghdad and you know went into the palaces you know this this thing with Kid Rock and everything at the airport thousands of people it was pretty pretty amazing just to be there with so many soldiers we entertained them there in the hanger maybe 4,000 people in the hanger you know I got to see the palaces I got to meet a lot a lot of troops during this this trip it was it was an amazing trip and I kind of befriended Tommy Franks from that moment on we ended up going to do a long after that to the central command and we did some shows there and met a lot of people and it was amazing I was back in Iraq within six months again for another trip I'll say this too and when you like I said so all that took place I wouldn't even go into Iraq I was awaiting to go to Iraq when did you go out of the fall of 2003 so I could work in the movies I'd never been the kind of guy who sat around and talked or wondered or thought about stuff without doing something about it at least not for long my response had always been to take action and hopefully doing so would benefit other people along the way in those early months of 2003 and again I jumped ahead to get here I realized I'd never before the cost of freedom and I knew freedom needed to be defended I knew places that existed in our world without freedom and I knew that without freedom nothing of the good and fulfilling ways we in America aspire to live our lives would be possible this realization helped fuel me more than ever before it made me profoundly grateful for being an American able to live in this land of freedom able to make something of my life when it came to service I wanted to be all in all the time living out my calling every single day for the rest of my life I can almost I can say most certainly that what happened to our country on September 11th broke my heart and changed me forever it forced me to rethink everything what do I really believe how do I want to raise my kids what kind of example do I want to set for them what can I do to give this great country what can I do to give back to this great country I love how can I use my good fortune to help it was a turning point and mark the beginning of a new level of service I found that the more I gave the more I heal cold two months after watching the statues of Saddam Hussein being pulled down I was on a plane to Kuwait nothing would ever be the same you we kind of kicked off you know the name of this next chapter is but a bridge between worlds you know and and bridging this thing and you got this here if that guy's uh not a hero then i have no idea who is well he's an he's an amazing guy and he's doing something really positive with his circumstance and he's helping and fellow veterans uh with his own foundation Travis milk foundation obviously wrote a book there was a movie uh Travis is an ambassador for my foundation so he'll do things from time to time to help us uh do more and you know i've met just extraordinary people we've we've done over sixty or seventy of these houses now um for very very badly wounded folks you know in all branches of service and it's been a privilege because i've learned quite a bit from a number of them and uh have many many friends who you know are in the wounded community as i said i've been involved with a d a b for many many years and so like i have many wounded pals from a lot of different wars and they they they give me a lot of inspiration little a lot of motivation to keep doing more you go on here another busy you as planned for 2010 35 concerts and additional events and supportive our troops they were still out there fighting and i kept doing so much because it needed to be done I'll always remember that first visit meeting specialist bramannus and so many other seniors young man in a hospital bed missing three out of four limbs yet made a lasting impression on me and at one point some of your friends and some of the partners from operation international children they weren't able to go to Iraq so they went over they delivered supplies and they stopped at launch to win Germany on the way back and going back to the book here there they met a young soldier named Brendan Morocco just 22 years old the first United States service member ever to survive after losing all four limbs in an IED explosion the blast happened during the early hours of Easter Sunday while Brendan was returning from a night mission in the deserts of Iraq he was in bad shape in addition to loosing both arms and both legs Brendan's nose left eye socket and facial bones were broken he lost eight teeth from the bat blast and had taken sharp known as left eye and face his face and neck and bit burned his left carotid artery severed and his left ear drum pierced usually a soldier this severely wounded would die but army medics had been making remarkable strides in meeting bat in treating battlefield wounds and you go into some details here but a guy named Sal Cassano my saying that right he's the commissioner of the New York fire department and they wanted to raise money to build Brendan Morocco especially adapted smart technology home in Staten Island they asked if you would help you know raise funds going back to the book as we were planning a fundraising concert for Brendan to be held in Staten Island in August of 2010 I received another call in March 26th 2010 while leading a squad of Marines on a security patrol in Afghanistan corporal Todd nicely 26 headstep on an IED buried at the foot of a bridge his fellow Marines quickly wrapped turnic hits around his wounds and administered more a fine rescue helicopter arrived within six minutes he became the second US service member to survive her injuries as a quadruple amputee I met Todd in the hospital then simply said to the tunnel to towers guys which the guys that are running this um this charity he needs a house too let's do another concert even before we played Brendan's concert we received a third call on May 24th 2010 sergeant John Peck had just finished sweeping a compound with the metal detector checking for bombs when he stepped on an IED he became America's third surviving quadruple amputee we decided to raise funds to help build homes for all three quadruple amputees back before my foundation was created it was no simple matter to help raise about a half a million bucks for each home project it still isn't a simple matter today Moira ends up going to a church looking for an AA meeting she passes an elderly French woman a member of the parish going back to the book the woman said an thick French accent my dear you need to become a Catholic you need to convert and walk away that got Moira to thinking here she was playing this Irish woman because she was in a play at the time playing this Irish woman searching for strength and a play set in a tavern and in her own life she was searching for strength to help with her sobriety nothing was set or done immediately but Moira later told me she began to feel a quiet yearning for her own shooting star and that's a reference that you talk about earlier about recognizing that there are other forces bigger than ourselves and you you're moving around a bit but Moira turned to me quite out of the blue and said oh when we get back home I'm going to become a Catholic and our kids are going to go to Catholics that's right fast forward a bit Moira was Moira got confirmed Ella started third grade max started fourth and Sophie started sixth at the local Catholic school fast forward a bit Moira and Christmas Eve 2010 I told my wife and kids to get dressed up we were headed for a special family dinner at Morton's stay cows the place we all enjoyed on a way to dinner I suddenly pulled into the church parking lot a mast was underway and my family looked confused and that's a that program you know we're about to the foundation the Gary Sonny's foundation that was a that was an organization that was started and every year I would go back and play a concert for the kids and be a part of the event American Airlines supplies all the transportation to get all the kids from all over the country to the to the event and a couple of years ago we folded that particular thing into the Gary Sonny's foundation as a program and we moved the event from Dallas where it had been for nine years to Disney World so we take over a thousand kids to Disney World along with you know four five hundred surviving parent or guardian or who's who's ever with the kids and we give them a lot of joy right before Christmas time at that the happiest place on earth it's extraordinary and my band has played concerts for the last I don't know 13 years something like that awesome um going back to these um hospital visits back to the book after a bomb exploded and it was the stars you know the national anthem and and people were just singing with candles on the corner in Malibu just coming together people were in pain all over the place and everyone was looking for something and during the day that day we went to our little Catholic church I don't know if you remember but George Bush said he was going to make that Friday a national day of prayer for the nation and so the churches and houses of worship everywhere in the country were just jam packed with people trying to find some peace some like trying to understand what was going on and trying to find something and we got to our little Catholic church at the school that my kids went to and there was only standing room it was packed and we like um you got this we built a home for us on army ranger sergeant first class Michael slits who served as a rifleman of patoon sergeant southern i rack on February 27 2007 Mike and his crew were conducting road clearing mission near Baghdad when their vehicle struck a hidden ID and burst into flame his gunner sergeant Richard Sukhenka and medic sergeant Jonathan cadvara were killed instantly his driver corporal lorn Henry junior passed away shortly after the blast Mike wrote in the passenger seat in gulfed in flames he was thrown from the vehicle he lost both hands and the sightness left eye and sustained burns over 85% of his body early in mics recovery started going to a program at UCLA called operation men consisting of a team of sergeant who helped provide free surgeries to our severely wounded veterans when i first met Mike he was so severely burned he didn't have a nose and he talked through a hole in his throat we struck up a friendship over the years he's had multiple reconstructive surgeries to repair the damage to his eyelids mouth and nose and other parts of his body where the skin was burned having last lost both arms he now uses to prosthetic hooks Mike's living situation post innumerable challenges for him because the fragility of his skin Mike preferred colder temperatures and often needed to turn the air conditioner on full blast his mom robby in his full-time caregiver and she wore heavy coats to keep warm in the house direct sunlight is hard on mics eye so he preferred to keep all the shades drawn we built them a home with one section for mic and another for his mom with a temperature and light needs section the house could be individually governed Mike has a special shower and the gym that he can navigate by himself we helped restore mics independence and helped empower them both Mike is an amazing individual who's dedicating his life to honoring his fallen brothers through serving his fellow veterans and ambassador for my foundation he helps us with our veterans outreach as our military and veterans resource manager with our smart home program we work with each wounded service member to provide exactly what they need master sergeant john Mason is married and has three kids on October 16th 2010 while conducting village stability operations in can to hard province afghanistan john a medic with a 20th special forces group step on a hidden ID and lost both legs and his left arm due to the severity of his amputations he can't wear prosthetics and he's confined to a wheelchair the hallways in his house were too narrow for a wheelchair additionally he couldn't reach anything in the closets and the bathroom is too small for him to navigate alone but it's not about me it's about making these guys feel better I learned I learned a lot on those first trips the landstool was the first military hospital that I went to their fresh off the battlefield as you know you know and the the guys that I just literally hours I mean the hours off the battlefield and as soon as I got there the bus pulled up we we were just about ready to get out of the bus and a fresh batch of wounded were were they were just pulling a bus up the airplane had just gotten in they put them on the bus they brought them to the hospital entrance so we were going in and they were all of a sudden all these all these technicians and everybody started running out of the hospital and started unloading this bus which was just nothing but gurneys with wires and you know wounded wounded folks on these gurneys and I just sat there and watched them unload the bus of gurneys I mean there's no other way to put it but when I deployed there in 2003 2004 it if you would have asked me at the end of my deployment how much longer the war in Iraq was going to last I would have said oh probably another three four months you know there'll be less less combat operations and then you know it'll be you know I'm sure we'll still have some troops there but it'll be pretty settled down so you know I was wrong Hi Terry I said Gary are you watching TV right now I just got up buddy what's going on two planes have hit the world trade center the tops of both buildings are on fire Terry's words spilled out we're under attack Gary Terry's have classed airplanes into those buildings it's bad really bad every American alive and then remembers that moment and can answer the inevitable question to where were you when you first heard the news I stared in shock and disbelief along with the entire country the entire world has smoked port from the tops of both buildings horrified we watched on live TV as people left to their deaths from the upper floors of the trade center as soon as the reports soon arrived at a third airplane a crash to the Pentagon about 20 minutes later a fourth airplane crashed near Shanksville Pennsylvania we heard it was united flight 93 seemingly bound for the White House the target was ultimately determined by the 9-11 Commission report to be the capital building people on board flight 93 had discovered that terrorist were crashing planes into buildings in the passenger to courageously yet faithfully chosen to take back the plane we watched the South Tower collapse and crumble in a fury of dust and smoke then the north tower fell horror enveloped us all you say while driving through one of the canyons and this is on September 11th I clicked on the radio news news castors speculated that today's attacks were only the beginning of more attacks to come the reality of the morning sank and even deeper our country was under attack vulnerable thousands of innocent people have been killed that day more horror lay ahead I couldn't tell you exactly why did this perhaps in solidarity defiance tribute but I rolled down my window stuck out my arm and made a fist and held it high here's well-duped my eyes as I listened to the news for some time as I wrote along I held my arm out stretched as high as it would reach you're living in California at the time in LA Malibu in Malibu and even in Malibu they broke out the American flags and then you just get involved in all kinds of things in trepid fallen heroes found Fisher house foundation tragedy assistance program for survivors you end up doing something called the snowball express idea was simple going from the book they brought they brought the children of our fallen heroes to Disneyland just before Christmas to allow them to meet each other to see they were not alone in their grief and to bring them some joy and new happy memories to this special group of children who are experiencing so much sadness especially at Christmas and and and you go on talking about that I could not be prouder to be part of creating opportunities for joy friendship and communal healing by connecting family struggling with loss to one another together they share a common bond and can feel a bigger part of a bigger family the children meet and interact with others who understand what they've been through and each and help each other through this unique and terrible experience they cannot be overstated what an event like this can mean to a child who is lost a parent or in military service struggling with their grief can be overwhelming and you nighting together with hundreds of other children experience a similar tragic loss can be the magic that carries them throughout the year there's so much joy on their faces during these moments it's a blessing to interact with kids this way at the same time I'm always reminded of the celebrity embedded in these moments of the incredible cost represented in the faces of the children who come to this event last year one girl wore a t-shirt to the event with these words printed on the back in honor and memory of an underneath the words was a blank box where kids could write in the name of their fallen hero in black marker the girl had simply written my daddy so I mean that that's the purpose that we decided to share it in the book you know it's it's it's played a role in the in my service life because you know becoming a you know remember the Catholic Church and and the service aspect of the faith and and what not there was definitely a role that that that faith played in my turning from self to service there's no question about speaking of turning from self to service jumping ahead here a bit one morning September about 630 more as more to help the kids get ready for school our phone rang I was still sleeping Terry Kenny who lived in New York was on the line simultaneously more to turn on the TV yes I don't know if you had I don't know if you had that little dude with them or not I remember that the first time I saw my said this is unusual but I'll tell you like no kidding when I saw him for the first time I was like this this guy is this guy rocks I called it at control so you see that but I wanted to do everything I could do to help in time we built homes for all three quadruple amputees and this new initiative steam rolled from there the good news was that thanks to new sophisticated life saving techniques on the battlefield more soldiers started surviving these horrific injuries the bad news was that after Brendan Todd and John more soldiers were wounded similar similarly staff sergeant Travis Mills was our fourth quadruple amputee a highly capable and resilient squad leader he later joked at his injury in afghanistan was only a bad case of the Mondays like so many of the wounded service members of Matt Travis is one of my heroes and we remain close friends to this day and Travis was on this podcast number 90 if you want to if you want to realize what a hero sounds like go listen to that navy petty officer Taylor Morris a member of an explosive ordinance disposal team became our nation's fifth surviving quadruple amputee from the wars in Iraq and afghanistan immediately after the blast that took his four limbs Taylor lay on the afghan soil fully conscious bleeding to death but before medics attended him Taylor ordered them to wait and make sure the ground surrounding him was clear of ideas he didn't want any other service members getting wounded where do they find such men And you know what, actually, when I heard that, I was like, okay, you know what, I get it, you know, that they're trying to, you know, break down some barriers. so you never know you know a difficult difficult difficult period in your life can manifest itself into something that you never could have predicted would would be positive you know had had had another time you know You know, so that attitude, it's pretty cool that you guys had this attitude of, like, you know, you know, you're going to start a theater company. right leg I met Mark on my first visit to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland on September 11th 2003 where he was recovering he was the first wounded service member I visited on the first of many trips over the years to where to to the DC military hospitals he wanted to talk about Lieutenant Dan and we shared a few stories and I sat with him for a while before I went on to the next room that afternoon I was at Walter Reed for the first time I visited with so many wounded heroes that day including many of the first triple amputees I would meet in the coming years just 21 year old just 21 years old US Army Specialist hilarious bramannus was serving with the 82nd Airborne Division in Baghdad on June 10th just 10 days before I would be in Baghdad myself specials bramannus and a fellow soldier came under attack while guarding a weapons turn in point a rocket propelled grenade killed his friend and took both bramannus's legs and his left hand as bramannus laying his bed as father stood by a side and told me what had happened and how hilarious video was from one of the tiny islands in the feathered states of micronesia three years earlier wanting to be an American soldier he'd gone to Guam to sign up for the US Army the week after my visit in a ceremony at Walter Reed on September 17th 2003 bramannus was awarded US citizenship powder form mix it up or you can take discipline ready to drink in a can ready to rock them all you may need so that can give you a little boost yes boost little boost you might need a boost of your protein and take if you need that cool we got you if you need dessert we got you because I know it's last two kind of the same thing dessert and protein dessert and protein moch moch all day by the way there is there is a thing that you can get on you can get on board it's called the moch train and then i was like you know right before i started the foundation i launched the foundation garyston use foundation 2011 so the chapter in the book called flurry of action kind of talks about 2009 2010 the two years leading up to the founding of the foundation because those year i was just ramping more more more and all the while i was i was shooting a television series right away at the same time so i was never home And each one of those things, by the way, you know, you, I mean, every one of those things, there's subcultures, you know, you can be in a music scene and be a total, you know, you can get sucked into drugs, rock and roll, right? so i thought let's capitalize on that in some way and and create an organization that can you know act as a reliable resource for people who want to support our veterans and military community and that's why i named it the gerryzonese foundation i mean people knew who i was at that point they knew i was in this for good i could have called it to help the troops foundation or something like that And you're right, you know, these guys that, and one thing that I've talked about, I talk about a lot of these manuals when we cover them, is, you know, I'll be saying, I'll be saying, whoever wrote that, like who wrote that part right there. yeah the fact that it's black is like it's black that's the cherry but it's also got it's got like the you know you ever use teacher you know and we hope it just keeps on going because it's a I think when I think is in some ways a little bit of a call to action I tried to tell a story of somebody who didn't see it coming but all of a sudden made a turn toward a service life which is basically that's what I do now you know I've done well in my acting career I was grateful that I had CSI New York as it gave me a lot of resources to do a lot of good things I I just felt you know on that first trip to the school I saw and watched the kids were loving the soldiers you know the soldiers rebuilt the school they came in there but windows in they did all kinds of stuff for the kids and the kids were very grateful the soldiers were just hugging the kids and it was a spirit that I thought was very important to preserve in some way but i can't go back in time Mikey the Dragons every kid is born afraid of things in the world they don't need to be they just need to read a simple book called Mikey the Dragons never realize how they can overcome those fears the disclinical freedom field manual two pages is a little dose that will propel you forward faster stronger and better that's a weird statement to make sounds like a big vault statement rig i'm telling you i wrote it it works on me i wrote the book i wrote the book if i read two pages on my car i'm gonna go a little bit harder i wrote it You know, John had a, you know, he rocketed, you know, he was nominated for an Oscar within two years of that play. i need to figure out some other way to do this and having been involved with so many military charities over the years and had established a good reputation within the support space you know that it's a you know people knew i was there for real I mean you can't you know you wait you know years from now you know Well, I, you know, I didn't know what the book was going to be called or exactly what it was going to be when I started. I was fearful that they were going to pull me out send me to like a juvenile home or something bus me really bus me and I begged the police officer to let me off the hook because I just discovered this new thing that I think you know is going to change my life and I will and it did. so we built john a house for him and his family that allows him to be independent and internal allows his wife and children to worry less about caring for him we built a home for captain Luis avila and his family Luis served five combat tours in afghanistan in Iraq on December 27, 2011 Luis's vehicle ran over an iED Luis lost his left leg then suffered two strokes and two heart attacks resulting in traumatic brain injury ultimately he was left almost completely paralyzed today he continues to heal while maintaining an incredibly positive attitude and sense of humor his wife kawty is his full-time caregiver and never leads leaves his side she is one of the fierce fighters for the needs of our wounded service members and reminds us of the importance of also supporting our caregivers each smart home is given to the veteran free of charge the mortgage for the house and land is completely underwritten the veteran can select what part of the country he or she wants to live in we built a home for police officer Michael Flamian from ballwin miserry you shot in the neck by an assailant during a routine traffic stop and his paralyzed from the neck down his wife is now his full-time caregiver and the home built specifically from Michael's challenges provide some much needed support and relief so gary like I said it's been for over four hours thank you so much for what you're doing thanks for coming on it's been an honor to meet you and look forward to you know having you back on here next time you get a spare month we can have you on here the talk it's good let me let me just say this too to you for your service to our country I'm one grateful america and I appreciate what you have done for our country and and I don't for one day take it for granted And the thing that when I was saying earlier that, like, I kind of, I don't know if we were recording yet, but the thing that I kind of relate, like when I was a kid, we all had bands. yeah that's how i got involved with the world war two museum you know over ten years ago they in tom hanks was one of the producers on that film and uh he invited me to play irney pile so i did the voice over for irney that started my relationship with the world war two museum now we've taken through my foundation and our soring vallar program we've taken hundreds of world war two veterans down to see them using him and we've recorded them on video telling their stories and those stories are preserved in the library at the museum We always deal with people's egos and I could see where this, this is a classic scenario where you could get mad and, you know, undermine him and do you know, do whatever, like all sorts of bad things can come from this. well I'm like I said as we started that chapter you know you said maybe someone will hear this and it'll help them I there's no maybe on that I promise you that people will hear that and and they will it will shed some light into their lives and help them get through to fight this this powerful powerful demon
