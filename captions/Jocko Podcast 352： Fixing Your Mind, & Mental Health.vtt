1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is Jocko podcast number 352 with me, Jocko willing.

2
00:00:06.88 --> 00:00:08.88
I feel certain I am going mad again.

3
00:00:10.08 --> 00:00:15.08
I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times.

4
00:00:15.44 --> 00:00:17.40
I shan't recover this time.

5
00:00:17.40 --> 00:00:20.88
I begin to hear voices and I can't concentrate.

6
00:00:20.88 --> 00:00:24.04
So I am doing what seems the best thing to do.

7
00:00:25.24 --> 00:00:28.36
You have given me the greatest possible happiness.

8
00:00:28.36 --> 00:00:32.40
You have been in every way all that anyone could be.

9
00:00:34.04 --> 00:00:36.80
I don't think two people could have been happier

10
00:00:36.80 --> 00:00:38.84
till this terrible disease came.

11
00:00:40.44 --> 00:00:41.84
I can't fight any longer.

12
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:45.20
I know that I am spoiling your life

13
00:00:45.20 --> 00:00:47.74
that without me you could work.

14
00:00:49.44 --> 00:00:50.92
And you will, I know.

15
00:00:53.04 --> 00:00:55.84
You see, I can't even write this properly.

16
00:00:55.84 --> 00:00:57.12
I can't read.

17
00:00:57.12 --> 00:00:59.44
What I wanna say is that I owe all the happiness

18
00:00:59.44 --> 00:01:00.66
of my life to you.

19
00:01:01.88 --> 00:01:05.88
You've been entirely patient with me and incredibly good.

20
00:01:05.88 --> 00:01:08.98
I wanna say that everybody knows it.

21
00:01:11.04 --> 00:01:13.80
If anybody could have saved me, it would have been you.

22
00:01:14.72 --> 00:01:17.08
Everything has gone from me, but the certainty

23
00:01:17.08 --> 00:01:18.22
of your goodness.

24
00:01:18.22 --> 00:01:26.22
I can't go on spoiling your life any longer.

25
00:01:26.22 --> 00:01:29.90
And that right there is the final work

26
00:01:29.90 --> 00:01:32.54
of the English writer, Virginia Woolf.

27
00:01:32.54 --> 00:01:36.34
It was a suicide note that she left to her husband, Leonard.

28
00:01:36.34 --> 00:01:41.34
Virginia Woolf was born into an affluent family.

29
00:01:41.34 --> 00:01:43.50
She was well cared for as a child.

30
00:01:43.50 --> 00:01:47.10
She was homeschooled in English and Victorian literature

31
00:01:47.10 --> 00:01:48.58
from a young age.

32
00:01:48.58 --> 00:01:51.14
She attended the ladies department of Kings College

33
00:01:51.14 --> 00:01:51.98
in London.

34
00:01:51.98 --> 00:01:56.98
She was successful by any measure.

35
00:01:58.04 --> 00:02:00.80
And she wrote a bunch of successful novels.

36
00:02:02.88 --> 00:02:06.10
She authored more than 500 essays and reviews.

37
00:02:06.10 --> 00:02:07.38
She had friends and family

38
00:02:07.38 --> 00:02:11.06
and a long seemingly happy marriage.

39
00:02:12.58 --> 00:02:14.18
And yet throughout her life,

40
00:02:14.18 --> 00:02:17.94
even with all those opportunities and advantages

41
00:02:17.94 --> 00:02:19.62
and benefits and privilege that she had,

42
00:02:19.62 --> 00:02:23.26
she suffered from mental health issues.

43
00:02:23.26 --> 00:02:27.22
She had mood swings and depression and manic excitement

44
00:02:27.22 --> 00:02:29.50
and psychotic episodes.

45
00:02:31.42 --> 00:02:36.42
And she attempted suicide twice before she was successful

46
00:02:36.42 --> 00:02:39.22
in killing herself in 1941.

47
00:02:39.22 --> 00:02:43.34
So how does that happen?

48
00:02:45.30 --> 00:02:47.62
What is going on there?

49
00:02:47.62 --> 00:02:50.42
And psychiatrists today, they hypothesized

50
00:02:50.42 --> 00:02:53.74
that she had a mental health problem,

51
00:02:53.74 --> 00:02:57.58
in particular likely bipolar disorder,

52
00:02:57.58 --> 00:03:00.26
which used to be called manic depression.

53
00:03:00.26 --> 00:03:03.42
And we've talked about mental health on this podcast.

54
00:03:03.42 --> 00:03:06.96
We've talked about mental health issues facing veterans.

55
00:03:06.96 --> 00:03:11.96
We've covered some tragic, horrible suicides,

56
00:03:14.58 --> 00:03:16.98
including Chad Wilkinson,

57
00:03:18.26 --> 00:03:21.30
Joe Price, Charles White,

58
00:03:21.30 --> 00:03:23.66
Wittlesley, Lewis Polar Jr.

59
00:03:25.26 --> 00:03:28.58
We've also talked about non-military suicides.

60
00:03:28.58 --> 00:03:30.02
We talked about Iris Chang,

61
00:03:31.06 --> 00:03:34.98
Iris Chang, who was the author of the bestselling book,

62
00:03:34.98 --> 00:03:36.18
New York Times bestselling book,

63
00:03:36.18 --> 00:03:37.30
The Rape of Nanking.

64
00:03:38.50 --> 00:03:42.06
And she had a nervous breakdown in August of 2004

65
00:03:42.06 --> 00:03:47.06
and was placed on a wide variety of prescription medication.

66
00:03:48.30 --> 00:03:50.70
But over time, the medications only seemed

67
00:03:50.70 --> 00:03:52.80
to amplify her issues and she was diagnosed

68
00:03:52.80 --> 00:03:57.44
with reactive psychosis and put on even more medication.

69
00:04:00.58 --> 00:04:02.50
And on November 8th, 2004,

70
00:04:02.50 --> 00:04:06.24
she wrote, when you believe you have a future,

71
00:04:06.24 --> 00:04:08.50
you think in terms of generations and years,

72
00:04:08.50 --> 00:04:12.86
when you do not, you just live by the day,

73
00:04:12.86 --> 00:04:13.98
but by the minute.

74
00:04:15.30 --> 00:04:18.18
It's far better that you remember me as I was

75
00:04:18.18 --> 00:04:21.10
in my heyday as a bestselling author.

76
00:04:22.82 --> 00:04:25.18
Each breath is becoming difficult for me to take.

77
00:04:25.18 --> 00:04:28.78
The anxiety can be compared to drowning in an open sea.

78
00:04:28.78 --> 00:04:33.70
I know my actions, I know that my actions will transfer

79
00:04:33.70 --> 00:04:36.62
some of this pain to others, indeed to those

80
00:04:36.62 --> 00:04:38.56
who love me the most.

81
00:04:39.58 --> 00:04:40.62
Please forgive me.

82
00:04:43.54 --> 00:04:46.30
And the next day, November 9th, 2004,

83
00:04:46.30 --> 00:04:47.98
she killed herself with a pistol.

84
00:04:51.26 --> 00:04:54.000
So these are topics that we've certainly addressed.

85
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.42
We've talked about them initially,

86
00:04:56.42 --> 00:04:58.34
really with Jordan Peterson.

87
00:04:58.34 --> 00:05:03.02
And focused on them in the most recent podcast,

88
00:05:03.02 --> 00:05:06.40
the last podcast we did, 251 with Marcus and Amber Capone.

89
00:05:07.66 --> 00:05:12.66
But it's an area that I still lack,

90
00:05:12.78 --> 00:05:16.02
even basic understanding of what mental health disorders

91
00:05:16.02 --> 00:05:18.18
are, where they come from, what we can do to prevent them

92
00:05:18.18 --> 00:05:21.42
or overcome them in some way.

93
00:05:21.42 --> 00:05:25.58
Luckily today, we have some experts from that field.

94
00:05:25.58 --> 00:05:29.60
Dr. Carlin Pleasance and Megan Harrison.

95
00:05:29.60 --> 00:05:31.80
Dr. Pleasance is a clinical psychologist

96
00:05:31.80 --> 00:05:35.96
who specializes in adult and adolescent psychotherapy.

97
00:05:36.88 --> 00:05:39.92
She's also the chief clinical advisor

98
00:05:39.92 --> 00:05:43.64
and a managing partner at a new treatment center

99
00:05:43.64 --> 00:05:44.80
in Scottsdale, Arizona.

100
00:05:44.80 --> 00:05:47.48
And Megan Harrison holds a master's degree

101
00:05:47.48 --> 00:05:50.74
in marriage and family therapy,

102
00:05:50.74 --> 00:05:52.76
with significant experience working with families

103
00:05:52.76 --> 00:05:56.72
affected by transgenerational trauma and mental illness.

104
00:05:57.80 --> 00:06:00.36
And Megan is the CEO and managing partner

105
00:06:00.36 --> 00:06:03.46
at a new treatment center in Scottsdale.

106
00:06:04.76 --> 00:06:09.48
So thank you both for joining us.

107
00:06:09.48 --> 00:06:10.32
Thanks for having us.

108
00:06:10.32 --> 00:06:11.16
Yes, thank you for having us.

109
00:06:11.16 --> 00:06:13.24
Yeah, it's great to meet you.

110
00:06:13.24 --> 00:06:15.88
You know, I mentioned that sort of my introduction

111
00:06:15.88 --> 00:06:20.08
to psychology, I would say was having

112
00:06:20.08 --> 00:06:21.84
Dr. Jordan Peterson on this podcast.

113
00:06:21.84 --> 00:06:24.44
And that's when I realized,

114
00:06:25.68 --> 00:06:29.76
I just didn't understand at all what was going on

115
00:06:29.76 --> 00:06:32.36
and what it meant to have a mental health issue.

116
00:06:32.36 --> 00:06:35.02
And I realized when he was on the podcast,

117
00:06:35.02 --> 00:06:37.60
as he was talking through some of the problems

118
00:06:37.60 --> 00:06:41.32
that people have, I realized that the mind,

119
00:06:41.32 --> 00:06:44.40
well, this is my simple caveman way of translating

120
00:06:44.40 --> 00:06:48.84
what he was saying, was that your mind is like a car.

121
00:06:48.84 --> 00:06:50.80
And sometimes the car breaks down

122
00:06:50.80 --> 00:06:53.12
or sometimes there's, you know, you blow a gasket

123
00:06:53.12 --> 00:06:55.52
or your oil is low.

124
00:06:55.52 --> 00:06:59.16
And when that happens, you take it into a mechanic.

125
00:06:59.16 --> 00:07:01.96
And the mechanic diagnosis what the problem is,

126
00:07:01.96 --> 00:07:04.96
oh, you blew a gasket, here's what we need to do to fix it.

127
00:07:06.48 --> 00:07:10.68
And so I realized that in many ways,

128
00:07:10.68 --> 00:07:11.80
the mind can do that too.

129
00:07:11.80 --> 00:07:14.32
You can blow up a gasket and there's people,

130
00:07:14.32 --> 00:07:16.28
psychologists or therapists,

131
00:07:16.28 --> 00:07:19.32
that can diagnose what the problem is

132
00:07:19.32 --> 00:07:22.68
and have methodologies and protocols

133
00:07:22.68 --> 00:07:25.82
to get those things fixed.

134
00:07:27.08 --> 00:07:30.80
So I, again, in my caveman brain,

135
00:07:30.80 --> 00:07:35.40
realized that psychologists and therapists

136
00:07:35.40 --> 00:07:37.48
are like mind mechanics that have seen,

137
00:07:37.48 --> 00:07:39.36
that's what triggered it for me,

138
00:07:39.36 --> 00:07:40.32
that's what triggered that thought,

139
00:07:40.32 --> 00:07:42.04
was he was telling me about,

140
00:07:42.04 --> 00:07:44.48
oh, I'd see this case, this type of case.

141
00:07:44.48 --> 00:07:46.16
You know, he'd see it again and he'd see it again

142
00:07:46.16 --> 00:07:47.68
and he'd say, again, and you develop a protocol

143
00:07:47.68 --> 00:07:48.56
on how to deal with it.

144
00:07:48.56 --> 00:07:51.44
Just like, oh, your car's making this noise,

145
00:07:51.44 --> 00:07:53.16
oh, okay, here's what the problem is.

146
00:07:53.16 --> 00:07:54.72
And you see that over and over again,

147
00:07:54.72 --> 00:07:56.28
you develop a protocol.

148
00:07:56.28 --> 00:08:01.28
So you too, welcome, and you too, are mind mechanics,

149
00:08:01.80 --> 00:08:03.72
as far as I can tell.

150
00:08:03.72 --> 00:08:05.98
Let's talk about how you guys got here,

151
00:08:05.98 --> 00:08:07.000
just a little bit of background

152
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.64
just so we get familiar with you.

153
00:08:08.64 --> 00:08:09.80
So let's start with you.

154
00:08:09.80 --> 00:08:13.08
Karlyn, where'd you grow up?

155
00:08:13.08 --> 00:08:14.56
How'd you end up in this scenario

156
00:08:14.56 --> 00:08:15.92
that you're in sitting here right now?

157
00:08:15.92 --> 00:08:19.40
Okay, let's see, well, I grew up in the Bay Area, California.

158
00:08:20.64 --> 00:08:23.68
And one of the things I think is really funny

159
00:08:23.68 --> 00:08:27.72
about my story is I didn't understand how I got here

160
00:08:27.72 --> 00:08:30.60
until much, much later, looking back

161
00:08:30.60 --> 00:08:32.12
and trying to figure it out.

162
00:08:32.12 --> 00:08:36.72
For a very long time, I was one of those folks

163
00:08:36.72 --> 00:08:39.22
when people would say, so why did you go into psychology?

164
00:08:39.22 --> 00:08:40.74
Why did you become a psychologist?

165
00:08:40.74 --> 00:08:43.56
I would say things like, oh, I just like helping people.

166
00:08:43.56 --> 00:08:44.76
I'm a good listener.

167
00:08:44.76 --> 00:08:48.58
I'm interested in how the mind works,

168
00:08:48.58 --> 00:08:53.34
which are true things, but really going back

169
00:08:53.34 --> 00:08:57.58
and taking a more in-depth look at my journey,

170
00:08:58.66 --> 00:09:00.86
it started when I was a kid.

171
00:09:00.86 --> 00:09:04.74
I had some pretty serious physical limitations

172
00:09:04.74 --> 00:09:08.98
and physical illnesses that kept me out of school

173
00:09:08.98 --> 00:09:09.82
for a long time.

174
00:09:09.82 --> 00:09:12.06
I did not take a single PE class,

175
00:09:12.06 --> 00:09:14.86
my entire scholastic career.

176
00:09:14.86 --> 00:09:18.38
Didn't get to participate the same way as other kids did.

177
00:09:18.38 --> 00:09:21.94
Missed a lot of things, was absent a lot of the time.

178
00:09:21.94 --> 00:09:25.22
And I remember being really young and thinking,

179
00:09:25.22 --> 00:09:26.98
like, is this it?

180
00:09:26.98 --> 00:09:27.82
Like, is this it?

181
00:09:27.82 --> 00:09:32.18
Can there be some other way of being,

182
00:09:32.18 --> 00:09:33.42
some other way of living?

183
00:09:33.42 --> 00:09:35.02
Cause it was lonely.

184
00:09:35.02 --> 00:09:38.22
And as a kid, the sense of feeling different,

185
00:09:38.22 --> 00:09:39.58
like I don't really belong.

186
00:09:39.58 --> 00:09:41.66
How old were you when these health issues started?

187
00:09:41.66 --> 00:09:42.50
Was this like everything?

188
00:09:42.50 --> 00:09:44.50
I was diagnosed when I was two.

189
00:09:44.50 --> 00:09:49.50
Two with like really severe respiratory and lung problems.

190
00:09:49.50 --> 00:09:52.98
And back then, I mean, we're talking early 70s, right?

191
00:09:52.98 --> 00:09:54.74
Like treatment was not as it is now.

192
00:09:54.74 --> 00:09:56.14
People didn't understand.

193
00:09:56.14 --> 00:10:01.14
I mean, my mom talks about how I was sick as an infant,

194
00:10:01.38 --> 00:10:04.70
and it took two years for a doctor to say,

195
00:10:04.70 --> 00:10:07.26
oh, I think I know what she has.

196
00:10:07.26 --> 00:10:08.70
Talk about a mechanic, right?

197
00:10:08.70 --> 00:10:11.78
She's taken me lots of mechanics over the years.

198
00:10:13.50 --> 00:10:16.02
And treatments weren't as advanced as they are now.

199
00:10:16.02 --> 00:10:19.46
So growing up all through elementary school,

200
00:10:19.46 --> 00:10:22.22
junior high, high school, feeling very separate

201
00:10:22.22 --> 00:10:25.50
and different and not included.

202
00:10:25.50 --> 00:10:28.30
And knowing that people thought I was kind of weird.

203
00:10:28.30 --> 00:10:30.34
How come you don't come to all the things?

204
00:10:30.34 --> 00:10:31.54
How come you don't take PE?

205
00:10:31.54 --> 00:10:34.30
How come you sit in recess when we all go outside?

206
00:10:34.30 --> 00:10:36.38
Right, which on one hand doesn't sound,

207
00:10:36.38 --> 00:10:39.02
I mean, whatever, it's the plight of a kid.

208
00:10:39.02 --> 00:10:41.18
But when I really look back and think about it,

209
00:10:41.18 --> 00:10:43.94
it was that sense of feeling alone

210
00:10:43.94 --> 00:10:48.94
and really misunderstood and not included in things.

211
00:10:50.06 --> 00:10:53.26
And wondering, like there's gotta be more.

212
00:10:53.26 --> 00:10:54.70
Like this can't be it.

213
00:10:54.70 --> 00:10:57.98
This just cannot be it for me, for people.

214
00:10:57.98 --> 00:11:02.66
So early on, I remember thinking when I grow up,

215
00:11:02.66 --> 00:11:03.70
like I wanna be a doctor.

216
00:11:03.70 --> 00:11:05.30
I wanna be somebody who helps,

217
00:11:05.30 --> 00:11:07.26
basically helps people like me.

218
00:11:07.26 --> 00:11:09.26
Again, in a young brain thinking,

219
00:11:09.26 --> 00:11:10.14
well, if I feel like this,

220
00:11:10.14 --> 00:11:11.82
probably everybody feels like this.

221
00:11:11.82 --> 00:11:13.38
And I don't want people to feel like this.

222
00:11:13.38 --> 00:11:15.86
So maybe I'll help kids or I'll help people

223
00:11:15.86 --> 00:11:18.34
with respiratory problems

224
00:11:18.34 --> 00:11:21.18
or I'll help people with medical illnesses.

225
00:11:21.18 --> 00:11:23.18
And it just kind of developed that way.

226
00:11:23.18 --> 00:11:25.98
This idea of wanting to, I don't know,

227
00:11:25.98 --> 00:11:27.86
in some way help ease the suffering

228
00:11:29.14 --> 00:11:31.66
that other people experience

229
00:11:31.66 --> 00:11:35.22
and make sense of what was going on.

230
00:11:35.22 --> 00:11:38.74
Now again, I don't remember it like this at the time.

231
00:11:38.74 --> 00:11:40.58
In my mind, I just wanted to help people.

232
00:11:40.58 --> 00:11:42.38
So did you apply yourself at school?

233
00:11:42.38 --> 00:11:43.66
Were you like, I need to get straight A's

234
00:11:43.66 --> 00:11:44.58
so I can be a doctor?

235
00:11:44.58 --> 00:11:45.86
I was like, yeah.

236
00:11:45.86 --> 00:11:49.18
So over a two, I mean, for what I couldn't do over here,

237
00:11:49.18 --> 00:11:50.78
I made up for it, way over here.

238
00:11:50.78 --> 00:11:53.02
So lots of good grades, lots of degrees,

239
00:11:53.02 --> 00:11:55.14
lots of academic awards.

240
00:11:55.14 --> 00:11:58.30
Did you go to school with the intent of becoming a doctor?

241
00:11:58.30 --> 00:12:01.82
At what point did you think psychology was the place to go?

242
00:12:01.82 --> 00:12:02.78
For a while, I was gonna,

243
00:12:02.78 --> 00:12:04.98
I wanted to go into medical, medical doctor.

244
00:12:04.98 --> 00:12:07.06
And then when I learned that you have to take a class

245
00:12:07.06 --> 00:12:10.66
called anatomy and look at bodies,

246
00:12:10.66 --> 00:12:13.58
I thought, yeah, this might not be for me.

247
00:12:13.58 --> 00:12:14.66
Like you're squeamish?

248
00:12:14.66 --> 00:12:15.90
This is totally squeamish.

249
00:12:15.90 --> 00:12:16.74
So I'm like, yeah, I don't know

250
00:12:16.74 --> 00:12:18.50
if that's then gonna work out for me very well

251
00:12:18.50 --> 00:12:20.04
to go that direction.

252
00:12:21.18 --> 00:12:26.10
But also again, the insight of this came through hindsight

253
00:12:26.10 --> 00:12:29.66
is I was so curious about,

254
00:12:29.66 --> 00:12:31.78
really the mental part of it, right?

255
00:12:31.78 --> 00:12:34.50
The experience of feeling isolated and disconnected

256
00:12:34.50 --> 00:12:39.50
and how that left you feeling or me feeling lonely

257
00:12:40.38 --> 00:12:44.10
and depressed and kind of like wanting more, right?

258
00:12:44.10 --> 00:12:46.26
So I got a little bit more curious

259
00:12:46.26 --> 00:12:48.62
in the like psychological department

260
00:12:48.62 --> 00:12:50.82
of what happens for people who have an illness,

261
00:12:50.82 --> 00:12:55.06
what happens for people who feel separate

262
00:12:55.06 --> 00:12:58.30
and different from everybody else who are left out,

263
00:12:58.30 --> 00:13:02.14
who are bullied, like what happens psychologically?

264
00:13:02.14 --> 00:13:04.58
So I definitely made a turn along the way.

265
00:13:04.58 --> 00:13:06.66
And was that in college?

266
00:13:06.66 --> 00:13:10.10
I would say maybe high schoolish going into college.

267
00:13:11.54 --> 00:13:15.58
Just kind of a fascination with how the mind works.

268
00:13:15.58 --> 00:13:20.58
And in some ways, unlike going to a mechanic,

269
00:13:21.02 --> 00:13:23.26
a lot of the psychological experiences

270
00:13:23.26 --> 00:13:26.58
that a person might have in reaction or relation

271
00:13:26.58 --> 00:13:29.50
to all of these different events, you don't see them.

272
00:13:29.50 --> 00:13:32.58
Like, you know, we can go into a doctor

273
00:13:32.58 --> 00:13:34.62
and take a listen to your head and go,

274
00:13:34.62 --> 00:13:37.82
oh, I recognize that clicking, I know exactly what to do.

275
00:13:37.82 --> 00:13:41.78
There are these kind of invisible unseen experiences

276
00:13:41.78 --> 00:13:44.10
that make it a little bit more challenging

277
00:13:44.10 --> 00:13:47.54
to figure out or understand what exactly is going on.

278
00:13:48.46 --> 00:13:50.98
So that curiosity, I just remember high school,

279
00:13:50.98 --> 00:13:54.06
probably going into college, just curious,

280
00:13:54.06 --> 00:13:55.70
like how does this work?

281
00:13:55.70 --> 00:13:58.34
Like why do I feel this way?

282
00:13:58.34 --> 00:14:00.58
But this person I met also had an illness

283
00:14:00.58 --> 00:14:04.22
when she was young and she seems to be okay.

284
00:14:04.22 --> 00:14:05.46
Like why did I suffer?

285
00:14:05.46 --> 00:14:07.14
Or why was I okay over here?

286
00:14:07.14 --> 00:14:10.94
But this guy couldn't do grades, you know?

287
00:14:10.94 --> 00:14:15.10
So this kind of curiosity about how the mind influences

288
00:14:15.10 --> 00:14:16.82
the experiences.

289
00:14:16.82 --> 00:14:19.86
And I remember sitting in a,

290
00:14:19.86 --> 00:14:22.38
I was probably getting close to getting my first degree

291
00:14:22.38 --> 00:14:26.42
and in a kind of a pathology class,

292
00:14:26.42 --> 00:14:28.66
kind of a mental illness, a class on mental illness

293
00:14:28.66 --> 00:14:30.86
and the pathology of illness,

294
00:14:30.86 --> 00:14:32.82
the professor said, show of hands,

295
00:14:32.82 --> 00:14:37.42
how many in here believe that you're in here to help people?

296
00:14:37.42 --> 00:14:39.02
You just wanna do good in the world,

297
00:14:39.02 --> 00:14:43.26
the good student, me, me, along with most of the other class.

298
00:14:43.26 --> 00:14:45.54
And he's like, okay, how many of you in here

299
00:14:45.54 --> 00:14:48.26
think that you have chosen this field

300
00:14:48.26 --> 00:14:51.98
or chosen this part of the field

301
00:14:51.98 --> 00:14:56.50
because you've got your own stuff you might need to work out.

302
00:14:56.50 --> 00:15:00.50
And everyone's like, not me, not me, not a hand

303
00:15:00.50 --> 00:15:02.22
or maybe like half hand.

304
00:15:03.50 --> 00:15:06.42
And by the end of that class, it was the reverse.

305
00:15:06.42 --> 00:15:08.42
Everybody was like, yep, I've got my own stuff,

306
00:15:08.42 --> 00:15:11.10
I need to work out, that's partly why I'm here.

307
00:15:11.10 --> 00:15:13.14
All right, so that started the,

308
00:15:14.50 --> 00:15:19.22
I think the kind of budding awareness

309
00:15:19.22 --> 00:15:21.18
that this isn't just about, for me,

310
00:15:21.18 --> 00:15:23.10
it wasn't just about helping people

311
00:15:23.10 --> 00:15:24.78
and being a good listener,

312
00:15:24.78 --> 00:15:27.66
but it was about understanding myself

313
00:15:27.66 --> 00:15:29.78
and hopefully through the process,

314
00:15:29.78 --> 00:15:33.10
being able to take that experience and help other people,

315
00:15:33.10 --> 00:15:36.46
whether that's not feel so alone

316
00:15:36.46 --> 00:15:38.98
or understand that there are options available

317
00:15:38.98 --> 00:15:42.02
or that this isn't kind of the fate of your life

318
00:15:43.22 --> 00:15:46.30
because you have this illness or this experience.

319
00:15:46.30 --> 00:15:49.62
So yeah, I definitely have swung from here,

320
00:15:49.62 --> 00:15:54.62
like I'm just really altruistic all the way over here too.

321
00:15:54.82 --> 00:15:57.18
Life is hard sometimes, life is really hard.

322
00:15:57.18 --> 00:16:00.58
And when you factor in, like my experience growing up

323
00:16:00.58 --> 00:16:02.78
with an illness, also growing up in a family

324
00:16:02.78 --> 00:16:04.58
where there were a lot of issues

325
00:16:04.58 --> 00:16:07.62
and not just in my immediate family, but generational.

326
00:16:07.62 --> 00:16:10.02
I mean, you and I, Megan have talked about this of

327
00:16:11.38 --> 00:16:15.18
trauma and addiction and loss and wartime.

328
00:16:15.18 --> 00:16:17.66
Like you kind of inherit a little bit of that

329
00:16:17.66 --> 00:16:19.06
along the way.

330
00:16:19.06 --> 00:16:24.06
So my curiosity over time expanded

331
00:16:24.06 --> 00:16:26.74
beyond just my own experience,

332
00:16:26.74 --> 00:16:28.58
but how does this happen in families?

333
00:16:28.58 --> 00:16:30.38
How does this happen through generations?

334
00:16:30.38 --> 00:16:33.66
How do you find, we had a client we saw

335
00:16:33.66 --> 00:16:35.22
at the treatment center for a long time

336
00:16:35.22 --> 00:16:38.66
who had schizophrenia, two siblings,

337
00:16:38.66 --> 00:16:40.30
a sister who did not have schizophrenia,

338
00:16:40.30 --> 00:16:41.30
a brother who did.

339
00:16:43.62 --> 00:16:46.14
Parents were really, really lovely, great people,

340
00:16:46.14 --> 00:16:49.02
did not seem to have a lot of stuff going on,

341
00:16:49.02 --> 00:16:52.26
but the dad's brother, the dad had three brothers,

342
00:16:52.26 --> 00:16:55.26
he was one of four, all three of them had schizophrenia.

343
00:16:55.26 --> 00:16:57.58
So this idea, right, of like, okay, some of this

344
00:16:58.54 --> 00:17:00.50
is passing down through generations,

345
00:17:00.50 --> 00:17:04.66
not just at a genetic level,

346
00:17:04.66 --> 00:17:07.22
but what you're exposed to and what you're seeing

347
00:17:07.22 --> 00:17:10.78
and what you're experiencing and what you're witnessing.

348
00:17:12.10 --> 00:17:16.10
So again, for me, the curiosity and the interest

349
00:17:16.10 --> 00:17:18.94
was about how do these things happen?

350
00:17:18.94 --> 00:17:22.38
How do they go from here to here to here to here?

351
00:17:22.38 --> 00:17:24.86
And what can we do to shift that?

352
00:17:24.86 --> 00:17:29.46
So people aren't just kind of living out

353
00:17:29.46 --> 00:17:33.46
this emotional inheritance or this traumatic inheritance,

354
00:17:33.46 --> 00:17:35.22
depending on what was going on in the family.

355
00:17:35.22 --> 00:17:36.58
How do you break that chain?

356
00:17:36.58 --> 00:17:37.78
How do you do something different?

357
00:17:37.78 --> 00:17:41.54
How do you set your own life up to go

358
00:17:41.54 --> 00:17:45.38
in a different trajectory than maybe how it's been going?

359
00:17:45.38 --> 00:17:48.50
And then your kids and their kids and their kids.

360
00:17:48.50 --> 00:17:49.34
So.

361
00:17:49.34 --> 00:17:51.74
Yeah, it makes sense that if you were gonna get

362
00:17:51.74 --> 00:17:54.26
like a personal trainer, because you wanna get in shape,

363
00:17:54.26 --> 00:17:57.22
it would be kind of, if you saw that that personal trainer

364
00:17:57.22 --> 00:17:59.74
had gone through some sort of transition themselves,

365
00:17:59.74 --> 00:18:02.54
you go, okay, this person kind of knows what I've been through.

366
00:18:02.54 --> 00:18:04.30
So you kind of got that vibe,

367
00:18:04.30 --> 00:18:06.14
I can say vibe a lot, so you gotta forget about that.

368
00:18:06.14 --> 00:18:08.30
I do too, it's okay.

369
00:18:08.30 --> 00:18:09.14
You kind of have that vibe.

370
00:18:09.14 --> 00:18:10.74
So what degrees did you end up with?

371
00:18:10.74 --> 00:18:12.58
What did you end up with?

372
00:18:12.58 --> 00:18:14.62
You said you got like degree upon degree.

373
00:18:14.62 --> 00:18:15.94
Yeah, yeah.

374
00:18:15.94 --> 00:18:18.74
So I got a bachelor's degree in psychology,

375
00:18:18.74 --> 00:18:21.02
which unfortunately in our field nowadays,

376
00:18:21.02 --> 00:18:23.70
that doesn't mean a whole lot other than you went to school

377
00:18:23.70 --> 00:18:25.90
for a few years and learned a bunch of things

378
00:18:25.90 --> 00:18:26.74
about the brain.

379
00:18:27.74 --> 00:18:31.54
Got my master's in counseling also in California,

380
00:18:31.54 --> 00:18:34.18
and then got my doctorate in clinical psychology

381
00:18:34.18 --> 00:18:35.38
down here in San Diego.

382
00:18:35.38 --> 00:18:36.86
Got it.

383
00:18:36.86 --> 00:18:38.26
All right.

384
00:18:38.26 --> 00:18:39.10
Megan.

385
00:18:39.10 --> 00:18:39.94
Yes.

386
00:18:39.94 --> 00:18:40.78
Let's talk about you.

387
00:18:40.78 --> 00:18:41.62
Where'd you grow up?

388
00:18:41.62 --> 00:18:42.62
How'd you end up here?

389
00:18:42.62 --> 00:18:45.06
Sure, feels like a big question.

390
00:18:45.06 --> 00:18:46.90
I grew up in Southern Wisconsin,

391
00:18:46.90 --> 00:18:50.02
really small town, beautiful there.

392
00:18:50.02 --> 00:18:51.94
Not much to do in that area,

393
00:18:51.94 --> 00:18:53.66
you're probably fishing.

394
00:18:53.66 --> 00:18:55.38
Where'd your parents go?

395
00:18:55.38 --> 00:18:59.06
My dad owned a chain of grocery stores,

396
00:18:59.06 --> 00:19:03.34
and my mom worked just cleaning houses

397
00:19:03.34 --> 00:19:06.94
and working for my uncle's scrap metal business,

398
00:19:06.94 --> 00:19:08.10
whatever we could do.

399
00:19:08.10 --> 00:19:10.78
And my dad that I'm speaking to came later on in life

400
00:19:10.78 --> 00:19:12.54
as well with like the chain of grocery stores.

401
00:19:12.54 --> 00:19:15.46
So the first part of my life was just me and mom.

402
00:19:15.46 --> 00:19:17.82
And so she taught me definitely hard work,

403
00:19:17.82 --> 00:19:19.38
but there wasn't much to do where I grew up.

404
00:19:19.38 --> 00:19:24.14
You were bowling, curling, fishing, hunting,

405
00:19:24.14 --> 00:19:24.98
or going to the bar.

406
00:19:24.98 --> 00:19:25.90
That was about it.

407
00:19:27.02 --> 00:19:28.18
Curling.

408
00:19:28.18 --> 00:19:29.82
Curling just made the podcast.

409
00:19:29.82 --> 00:19:33.10
We're 352 podcasts deep, and we just got into curling.

410
00:19:33.10 --> 00:19:35.90
It's a big deal in Wisconsin, let me tell you.

411
00:19:35.90 --> 00:19:38.06
It's very cold for about eight months out of the year.

412
00:19:38.06 --> 00:19:40.66
So, yeah.

413
00:19:40.66 --> 00:19:44.66
I mean, my story, I was born into a family system

414
00:19:44.66 --> 00:19:46.38
that had definitely been impacted

415
00:19:46.38 --> 00:19:48.82
by just generations of trauma,

416
00:19:49.94 --> 00:19:52.98
abuse, addiction, mental health issues

417
00:19:52.98 --> 00:19:54.42
on the very severe end.

418
00:19:54.42 --> 00:19:58.54
And similar to what Karlin is saying,

419
00:19:58.54 --> 00:20:00.50
I don't know that like sitting here right now,

420
00:20:00.50 --> 00:20:02.38
like the only intentionality in that for me

421
00:20:02.38 --> 00:20:04.54
in coming into this therapy world was just this idea

422
00:20:04.54 --> 00:20:08.98
that through life, every step I took forward

423
00:20:08.98 --> 00:20:12.22
in terms of overcoming just brought me further

424
00:20:12.22 --> 00:20:14.38
into the life that I envisioned for myself.

425
00:20:14.38 --> 00:20:16.90
And that was sort of my intention in that way.

426
00:20:16.90 --> 00:20:18.66
But I knew growing up in that environment

427
00:20:18.66 --> 00:20:20.86
that there was no way I was gonna be able

428
00:20:20.86 --> 00:20:23.18
to do something different for myself

429
00:20:23.18 --> 00:20:24.58
or do something different for the family

430
00:20:24.58 --> 00:20:26.06
I wanted to have if I stayed there.

431
00:20:26.06 --> 00:20:27.46
And so from a very young age,

432
00:20:27.46 --> 00:20:30.74
I sort of started my path towards independence.

433
00:20:30.74 --> 00:20:32.74
I started working at a very young age.

434
00:20:33.90 --> 00:20:36.50
The military sort of came into my life as this idea

435
00:20:36.50 --> 00:20:39.14
like here's an opportunity to go somewhere,

436
00:20:39.14 --> 00:20:40.02
to do something.

437
00:20:40.02 --> 00:20:43.38
I actually was finishing some high school stuff

438
00:20:43.38 --> 00:20:48.38
at a community college and was watching

439
00:20:48.38 --> 00:20:51.06
the September 11th occurrences in 2001.

440
00:20:51.06 --> 00:20:53.98
And I just remember looking at the screen and being like,

441
00:20:55.02 --> 00:20:57.30
oh, this is what I'm gonna do.

442
00:20:57.30 --> 00:20:59.90
I had entertained the military for a period of time.

443
00:20:59.90 --> 00:21:01.30
And I had thought maybe this was my opportunity,

444
00:21:01.30 --> 00:21:03.10
but it was in that moment that I was like, okay,

445
00:21:03.10 --> 00:21:04.70
like this, I feel a sense of purpose,

446
00:21:04.70 --> 00:21:05.62
like drawn to something.

447
00:21:05.62 --> 00:21:06.94
And in the environment that I grew up in,

448
00:21:06.94 --> 00:21:10.14
I kind of always knew that I wanted something different

449
00:21:10.14 --> 00:21:12.30
for myself, but I lacked a lot of direction

450
00:21:12.30 --> 00:21:14.82
and people in my life to kind of help me guide

451
00:21:14.82 --> 00:21:17.74
in that way, education wasn't particularly valued

452
00:21:17.74 --> 00:21:19.14
or seen as like a possibility.

453
00:21:19.14 --> 00:21:20.14
And at that point in my life,

454
00:21:20.14 --> 00:21:22.70
I hadn't had enough experiences

455
00:21:22.70 --> 00:21:25.62
other than just like surviving in a lot of ways

456
00:21:25.62 --> 00:21:29.30
to see that as possible for myself,

457
00:21:29.30 --> 00:21:31.42
to see ready to like go to school and do that route.

458
00:21:31.42 --> 00:21:33.86
And so the military just felt like, like, okay,

459
00:21:33.86 --> 00:21:35.14
this is what I'm gonna go do.

460
00:21:35.14 --> 00:21:36.38
And there's like something really important

461
00:21:36.38 --> 00:21:37.42
that's happening, I need to go do it.

462
00:21:37.42 --> 00:21:40.74
And it was about a year later, August of 2002

463
00:21:40.74 --> 00:21:42.90
that I was on active duty and...

464
00:21:42.90 --> 00:21:44.54
And what'd you join?

465
00:21:44.54 --> 00:21:45.50
I joined the Navy.

466
00:21:45.50 --> 00:21:46.34
How'd you pick that?

467
00:21:46.34 --> 00:21:47.34
Being a Wisconsin.

468
00:21:47.34 --> 00:21:48.50
You know, it's really interesting.

469
00:21:48.50 --> 00:21:51.06
I think it was, it had to do with the recruiter at the time

470
00:21:51.06 --> 00:21:55.14
because I was definitely a youth that was getting,

471
00:21:55.14 --> 00:21:57.10
you know, some help from the community

472
00:21:57.10 --> 00:21:57.94
and different things.

473
00:21:57.94 --> 00:21:58.98
And at that time in the Midwest,

474
00:21:58.98 --> 00:22:00.70
you know, recruiters would come into those areas

475
00:22:00.70 --> 00:22:01.98
and introduce themselves and such.

476
00:22:01.98 --> 00:22:04.42
And so I just remember him as being somebody

477
00:22:04.42 --> 00:22:07.78
that I was like, okay, like he seems confident.

478
00:22:07.78 --> 00:22:09.70
Like, he carries himself,

479
00:22:09.70 --> 00:22:12.58
like this is like something I wanna be a part of.

480
00:22:13.62 --> 00:22:14.70
And it sort of seems cliche,

481
00:22:14.70 --> 00:22:16.30
but at the time it was everything for me

482
00:22:16.30 --> 00:22:17.98
because I didn't, you know, the friends that I had

483
00:22:17.98 --> 00:22:20.38
at the time and I had, you know, been living with friends

484
00:22:20.38 --> 00:22:21.70
at a very young age and such,

485
00:22:21.70 --> 00:22:23.34
like we weren't really going to a lot of places,

486
00:22:23.34 --> 00:22:26.14
jail, I lost a lot of friends to, you know, death,

487
00:22:26.14 --> 00:22:27.94
you know, suicide, overdoses.

488
00:22:27.94 --> 00:22:30.82
There was just a lot of that in my life.

489
00:22:30.82 --> 00:22:35.74
And so just being around somebody who just sort of

490
00:22:35.74 --> 00:22:38.10
represented like a possibly different future

491
00:22:38.10 --> 00:22:39.90
and like life was huge for me.

492
00:22:39.90 --> 00:22:41.46
It was like a role model mentor.

493
00:22:42.98 --> 00:22:45.54
And so I joined.

494
00:22:45.54 --> 00:22:46.98
What job did you sign up for?

495
00:22:46.98 --> 00:22:49.22
So I came in as a signalman.

496
00:22:49.22 --> 00:22:50.42
And that's what I went to A-School for,

497
00:22:50.42 --> 00:22:51.66
but I dates myself a little bit

498
00:22:51.66 --> 00:22:54.18
because it's already kind of like a dying rate at the time.

499
00:22:54.18 --> 00:22:55.78
So I went to A-School to be a signalman.

500
00:22:55.78 --> 00:22:59.54
And my first orders were actually to the USS Kitty Hawk

501
00:22:59.54 --> 00:23:01.26
and in Japan at the time.

502
00:23:01.26 --> 00:23:05.62
And I was like set to leave about a week later

503
00:23:05.62 --> 00:23:06.70
and my orders got canceled

504
00:23:06.70 --> 00:23:08.46
because there wasn't enough birthing for females at the time.

505
00:23:08.46 --> 00:23:11.14
And I was rerouted to ACB One in San Diego.

506
00:23:11.14 --> 00:23:16.14
And I got there and I was getting issued camis and boots

507
00:23:16.34 --> 00:23:18.06
and like we were getting ready to deploy to Kuwait

508
00:23:18.06 --> 00:23:19.54
because this was like August of,

509
00:23:19.54 --> 00:23:22.30
or this was like latter part of 2002.

510
00:23:22.30 --> 00:23:25.02
So we were like getting ready to go overseas

511
00:23:25.02 --> 00:23:26.58
for everything that was happening during operation

512
00:23:26.58 --> 00:23:28.82
and during freedom and during that time.

513
00:23:28.82 --> 00:23:32.30
And so I was like, what did I just get myself into?

514
00:23:32.30 --> 00:23:34.46
Because I thought I was going to a ship

515
00:23:34.46 --> 00:23:36.86
and then here I am in like a whole different world

516
00:23:36.86 --> 00:23:37.94
as I'm sure you're familiar.

517
00:23:37.94 --> 00:23:39.86
The CVs are just a whole different realm and such.

518
00:23:39.86 --> 00:23:43.66
And so, but it was such a blessing for me

519
00:23:43.66 --> 00:23:46.86
because it was like a form of reparenting

520
00:23:46.86 --> 00:23:48.70
like the amount of structure that I went into.

521
00:23:48.70 --> 00:23:50.90
I knew exactly what was expected of me.

522
00:23:50.90 --> 00:23:53.62
And it was also the first time that I learned how much

523
00:23:53.62 --> 00:23:55.70
I think because of the environment I grew up in

524
00:23:55.70 --> 00:23:59.90
that I thrive in crisis in some ways.

525
00:23:59.90 --> 00:24:02.38
Like things get crazy, something's happening.

526
00:24:02.38 --> 00:24:04.38
Everything for me just kind of calms down.

527
00:24:04.38 --> 00:24:08.22
And I wanted to lead and I found myself

528
00:24:08.22 --> 00:24:09.58
in a lot of leadership positions.

529
00:24:09.58 --> 00:24:11.90
I found myself an opportunity like volunteer for this,

530
00:24:11.90 --> 00:24:13.34
volunteer for that, I'll do it.

531
00:24:13.34 --> 00:24:16.78
And it really gave me the opportunity to just build

532
00:24:16.78 --> 00:24:18.42
a sense of self for the first time.

533
00:24:18.42 --> 00:24:21.58
The community, the feedback that I was getting

534
00:24:21.58 --> 00:24:22.62
was just huge for me.

535
00:24:22.62 --> 00:24:24.66
And then all kinds of doors opened up for me.

536
00:24:24.66 --> 00:24:27.46
The idea of like, I could go to school, I could do this.

537
00:24:28.62 --> 00:24:31.02
My first interest in doing some counseling such

538
00:24:31.02 --> 00:24:32.58
actually came from, I thought originally

539
00:24:32.58 --> 00:24:36.42
I was gonna go to school to do organizational psychology

540
00:24:36.42 --> 00:24:38.62
for leadership, like that was really my goal.

541
00:24:38.62 --> 00:24:40.90
I always wanted to be a leader for me.

542
00:24:40.90 --> 00:24:42.62
Just before you joined the Navy or once you got in?

543
00:24:42.62 --> 00:24:45.62
Once I got in, you know, and I was just kind of drawn

544
00:24:45.62 --> 00:24:48.78
into these situations where I knew that there was like,

545
00:24:48.78 --> 00:24:50.30
I don't know if you wanna call it a natural leadership

546
00:24:50.30 --> 00:24:52.30
quality, but there was just like this part of me

547
00:24:52.30 --> 00:24:55.74
that I had gone through so much and I had overcome so much

548
00:24:55.74 --> 00:24:58.86
that it was like people need that, you know,

549
00:24:58.86 --> 00:25:00.98
to like hear that story, to be a part of that.

550
00:25:00.98 --> 00:25:05.10
Like it just, it was a really powerful thing for me.

551
00:25:05.10 --> 00:25:07.58
And I was realizing for other people as well at the time.

552
00:25:07.58 --> 00:25:11.74
And so I got offered an opportunity to do some work

553
00:25:11.74 --> 00:25:16.74
with families in pre and post deployment sort of support.

554
00:25:16.82 --> 00:25:18.82
And it was very logistical at the time,

555
00:25:18.82 --> 00:25:21.86
how do you support families and like, you know,

556
00:25:21.86 --> 00:25:24.94
preparing for the logistics of bills or separation

557
00:25:24.94 --> 00:25:25.78
or what's going on.

558
00:25:25.78 --> 00:25:28.90
But what I realized at that time was that there was a

559
00:25:28.90 --> 00:25:32.34
significant amount of support that these families needed

560
00:25:32.34 --> 00:25:35.22
and understand like how much role shifts were happening

561
00:25:35.22 --> 00:25:38.14
when one of the partners would deploy and then I'm making

562
00:25:38.14 --> 00:25:41.18
this new group of friends while my husband or my wife

563
00:25:41.18 --> 00:25:43.54
is gone and they're making their new group of friends.

564
00:25:43.54 --> 00:25:46.46
And our kids are getting used to me as playing like both

565
00:25:46.46 --> 00:25:48.34
mom and dad and doing these different roles.

566
00:25:48.34 --> 00:25:51.18
And they just did not have the resources to be able

567
00:25:51.18 --> 00:25:52.02
to deal with that.

568
00:25:52.02 --> 00:25:55.90
And I think because I had gone through what I did as a child,

569
00:25:55.90 --> 00:25:58.90
I could recognize things related to like mental health

570
00:25:58.90 --> 00:26:01.34
or relationship issues or things like that.

571
00:26:01.34 --> 00:26:03.30
I didn't really have the skill set yet to know exactly

572
00:26:03.30 --> 00:26:06.54
what to do with that other than just my mindset was always

573
00:26:06.54 --> 00:26:09.38
like, you just do keep moving forward.

574
00:26:09.38 --> 00:26:12.02
And one step at a time and you make healthy decisions

575
00:26:12.02 --> 00:26:14.74
and you recognize that, you know, I don't exist in a vacuum

576
00:26:14.74 --> 00:26:17.98
and the things that I do matter and how I treat people matter.

577
00:26:17.98 --> 00:26:19.70
And I could support people a lot with that,

578
00:26:19.70 --> 00:26:23.26
but it was, that was what first drew me to the idea

579
00:26:23.26 --> 00:26:24.22
of counseling.

580
00:26:24.22 --> 00:26:28.98
And at the time I was working,

581
00:26:28.98 --> 00:26:30.38
when I decided to go to school for counseling,

582
00:26:30.38 --> 00:26:32.66
I was working as a contractor for HSC three.

583
00:26:32.66 --> 00:26:33.50
So this was after.

584
00:26:33.50 --> 00:26:34.54
So how long did you end up doing in the Navy?

585
00:26:34.54 --> 00:26:35.38
So I did five years.

586
00:26:35.38 --> 00:26:37.58
I did four years on active duty and then I extended

587
00:26:37.58 --> 00:26:38.42
for a year.

588
00:26:38.42 --> 00:26:40.46
How was that first deployment to Kuwait?

589
00:26:40.46 --> 00:26:44.06
It was intense.

590
00:26:44.06 --> 00:26:46.86
You know, we were at the Kuwaiti Naval Base.

591
00:26:46.86 --> 00:26:49.62
We came in during a time where really nothing was set up.

592
00:26:49.62 --> 00:26:51.26
Our goal is that being the CBs there,

593
00:26:51.26 --> 00:26:53.18
ACB one and ACB two were there at the same time.

594
00:26:53.18 --> 00:26:56.42
So when we got there, we knew we're not leaving for a while.

595
00:26:56.42 --> 00:26:58.90
Cops and CBs, by the way, CBs are awesome.

596
00:26:58.90 --> 00:27:00.34
Yes, they definitely are.

597
00:27:00.34 --> 00:27:02.14
And I definitely make friends with builders

598
00:27:02.14 --> 00:27:04.42
because your camp will be real nice.

599
00:27:04.42 --> 00:27:06.06
You'll get a nice little shelf up there

600
00:27:06.06 --> 00:27:07.26
and all the things that you need.

601
00:27:07.26 --> 00:27:09.86
And they'll steal you whatever you need.

602
00:27:09.86 --> 00:27:12.46
Which no one wants to talk about.

603
00:27:12.46 --> 00:27:15.26
I learned how to be very resourceful.

604
00:27:15.26 --> 00:27:17.38
There was also some aspects of being in the military

605
00:27:17.38 --> 00:27:19.14
as a female in that type of environment

606
00:27:19.14 --> 00:27:21.30
and a lot of things that were going on during that time

607
00:27:21.30 --> 00:27:23.42
that made it a scary situation sometimes too.

608
00:27:23.42 --> 00:27:25.06
You want to feel safe in that environment.

609
00:27:25.06 --> 00:27:28.70
But there was, you know, you're in the middle of the desert

610
00:27:28.70 --> 00:27:30.02
and people are going through wartime.

611
00:27:30.02 --> 00:27:32.34
And we had incoming missiles coming in.

612
00:27:32.34 --> 00:27:34.14
We're running to Connick's bosses that

613
00:27:34.14 --> 00:27:35.98
are buried in the ground for shelter.

614
00:27:35.98 --> 00:27:41.82
Like people were on edge during that time, for sure.

615
00:27:41.82 --> 00:27:43.30
But I learned a lot.

616
00:27:43.30 --> 00:27:45.54
And if anything, it was walking away from that knowing

617
00:27:45.54 --> 00:27:49.62
that I could, you know, it doesn't matter what life

618
00:27:49.62 --> 00:27:50.22
throws at you.

619
00:27:50.22 --> 00:27:53.54
If you just keep moving forward, you'll get through it,

620
00:27:53.54 --> 00:27:54.02
for sure.

621
00:27:54.02 --> 00:27:57.50
So if I can interrupt, I remember you telling a story

622
00:27:57.50 --> 00:28:01.74
one time, Megan, about having to dig holes

623
00:28:01.74 --> 00:28:05.98
to sleep in the ground and having your gun there

624
00:28:05.98 --> 00:28:08.42
because of how big the scorpions were.

625
00:28:08.42 --> 00:28:10.62
And having to protect yourself and guard yourself

626
00:28:10.62 --> 00:28:13.78
from the scorpions while you're in a hole in the desert

627
00:28:13.78 --> 00:28:18.06
at 127 degrees and you're like 19.

628
00:28:18.06 --> 00:28:19.70
Yeah, I think you can pretty much

629
00:28:19.70 --> 00:28:23.90
handle whatever is going to come your way in life.

630
00:28:23.90 --> 00:28:26.70
But I mean, this is sort of where you're talking about earlier,

631
00:28:26.70 --> 00:28:28.70
where one person can have one situation growing up

632
00:28:28.70 --> 00:28:30.98
and another can have an entirely different situation.

633
00:28:30.98 --> 00:28:33.90
And how you choose to respond is going to very much

634
00:28:33.90 --> 00:28:35.86
so shape the outcome of who you are.

635
00:28:35.86 --> 00:28:37.86
And so for me, I just, you know, there

636
00:28:37.86 --> 00:28:39.50
was a lot of opportunity to move into fear

637
00:28:39.50 --> 00:28:40.94
and have fear make you small.

638
00:28:40.94 --> 00:28:42.86
And for me, it was just like, I'm just going to keep going.

639
00:28:42.86 --> 00:28:45.34
But there wasn't, at that time in my life, I can't say,

640
00:28:45.34 --> 00:28:47.82
I mean, I was very young that I was intentionally, like,

641
00:28:47.82 --> 00:28:49.30
this is what I'm doing to overcome.

642
00:28:49.30 --> 00:28:50.62
Or that really wasn't there for me.

643
00:28:50.62 --> 00:28:53.74
It just like stopping or not moving or going backwards

644
00:28:53.74 --> 00:28:54.50
wasn't an option.

645
00:28:54.50 --> 00:28:57.78
Just keep moving forward with whatever kind of presented

646
00:28:57.78 --> 00:28:58.42
itself to me.

647
00:28:58.42 --> 00:29:01.66
So yeah, I was there for a year and actually didn't find out

648
00:29:01.66 --> 00:29:03.66
till the day before we were leaving that I was leaving.

649
00:29:03.66 --> 00:29:05.50
So it was like, you know, coming up to you like,

650
00:29:05.50 --> 00:29:07.18
here's your plane ticket, you're leaving tomorrow.

651
00:29:07.18 --> 00:29:08.30
I'm like, cool.

652
00:29:08.30 --> 00:29:10.58
And at the time, you know, cell phones weren't allowed.

653
00:29:10.58 --> 00:29:12.02
We couldn't have any of that.

654
00:29:12.02 --> 00:29:16.22
And so there was two phones in the camp for a camp of, gosh,

655
00:29:16.22 --> 00:29:17.34
don't quote me on this.

656
00:29:17.34 --> 00:29:18.62
But there was a lot of people.

657
00:29:18.62 --> 00:29:19.66
The army was there.

658
00:29:19.66 --> 00:29:22.54
I won't quote you on a lot of people being super specific

659
00:29:22.54 --> 00:29:23.62
like that.

660
00:29:23.62 --> 00:29:26.70
The, you know, special operations, special forces

661
00:29:26.70 --> 00:29:27.26
were there.

662
00:29:27.26 --> 00:29:28.58
The Air Force was there.

663
00:29:28.58 --> 00:29:31.34
We had Australian, British, you know,

664
00:29:31.34 --> 00:29:33.78
military was a huge camp, Kuwaiti Naval Base.

665
00:29:33.78 --> 00:29:38.14
And so two phones for a large group of people

666
00:29:38.14 --> 00:29:40.02
would make the line very long that you're

667
00:29:40.02 --> 00:29:41.62
waiting, you could be standing there in hours.

668
00:29:41.62 --> 00:29:43.18
And then there'd be an incoming missile.

669
00:29:43.18 --> 00:29:46.50
Everybody'd have to run, go take, you know, shelter.

670
00:29:46.50 --> 00:29:48.74
And then I gave up.

671
00:29:48.74 --> 00:29:50.34
So I didn't make any phones.

672
00:29:50.34 --> 00:29:53.38
And also for me, like, I, you know, I was, I was moving

673
00:29:53.38 --> 00:29:55.46
forward and didn't have a whole lot of connections to the past.

674
00:29:55.46 --> 00:29:58.46
So I was just, yeah.

675
00:29:58.46 --> 00:30:00.54
So you get done with your Navy career.

676
00:30:00.54 --> 00:30:01.98
You end up as a contractor.

677
00:30:01.98 --> 00:30:06.02
And this is, so when did you end up like going to school?

678
00:30:06.02 --> 00:30:08.26
So that was when I was a, when I was a contractor, I started.

679
00:30:08.26 --> 00:30:10.98
So I started with my, I actually went to school to be a pharmacy

680
00:30:10.98 --> 00:30:12.46
tech while I was still on active duty.

681
00:30:12.46 --> 00:30:16.50
I was, you know, single mom at the time and just raising my son

682
00:30:16.50 --> 00:30:18.98
and going to school at night and working during the day.

683
00:30:18.98 --> 00:30:21.70
And pharmacy tech seemed like a good option for me at the time

684
00:30:21.70 --> 00:30:22.82
to have a job when I got out.

685
00:30:22.82 --> 00:30:24.98
So I finished that before I got out.

686
00:30:24.98 --> 00:30:27.66
I started working at a compounding pharmacy.

687
00:30:27.66 --> 00:30:31.46
I very quickly realized this is not what I want to do.

688
00:30:31.46 --> 00:30:34.82
Went back to school for my bachelor's in psychology

689
00:30:34.82 --> 00:30:37.02
and then started working towards my master's

690
00:30:37.02 --> 00:30:38.18
in that contractor work.

691
00:30:38.18 --> 00:30:42.30
So my bachelor's and my master's all came after I had separated

692
00:30:42.30 --> 00:30:43.98
from the military.

693
00:30:43.98 --> 00:30:47.14
So, and so yeah, I obtained my master's while I was working

694
00:30:47.14 --> 00:30:50.58
as a contractor and was introduced for my practicum.

695
00:30:50.58 --> 00:30:54.50
So in counseling psychology, you have to do some pre-degree

696
00:30:54.50 --> 00:30:57.30
and post-degree hours, about a total of 3,000 direct,

697
00:30:57.30 --> 00:31:00.02
like direct and indirect clinical hours in order

698
00:31:00.02 --> 00:31:00.86
to obtain your degree.

699
00:31:00.86 --> 00:31:03.10
And so you get introduced to various treatment centers

700
00:31:03.10 --> 00:31:07.06
while you're in your school to, you know,

701
00:31:07.06 --> 00:31:08.54
get that experience and practice.

702
00:31:08.54 --> 00:31:10.62
And that was when I was actually introduced to Humblechia,

703
00:31:10.62 --> 00:31:12.86
which was owned by Kerry and Carlin at the time.

704
00:31:12.86 --> 00:31:14.82
So treatment center for clients

705
00:31:14.82 --> 00:31:16.26
with complex psychiatric disorders.

706
00:31:16.26 --> 00:31:18.82
And again, for me at the time, I was like,

707
00:31:18.82 --> 00:31:21.26
this is just sounds so interesting, family therapy

708
00:31:21.26 --> 00:31:22.10
and all of that.

709
00:31:22.10 --> 00:31:23.94
In my mind, I was going to school

710
00:31:23.94 --> 00:31:26.42
because this was the school that I could do at night

711
00:31:26.42 --> 00:31:27.38
while I was commuting.

712
00:31:27.38 --> 00:31:30.50
I was commuting from Temecula down to Naval Air Station

713
00:31:30.50 --> 00:31:31.34
at the time.

714
00:31:31.34 --> 00:31:32.70
It was like 72 miles one way.

715
00:31:32.70 --> 00:31:35.22
And so I was just kind of moving through life, like,

716
00:31:35.22 --> 00:31:36.78
you know, just doing the things that I thought

717
00:31:36.78 --> 00:31:38.34
I needed to do to move forward.

718
00:31:39.18 --> 00:31:41.42
And then I met Kerry and Carlin

719
00:31:41.42 --> 00:31:43.26
and I came to know Humblechia.

720
00:31:43.26 --> 00:31:48.02
And Humblechia was just this really special place.

721
00:31:48.02 --> 00:31:51.18
It was like, I like to call it like a,

722
00:31:51.18 --> 00:31:53.94
I'm very much all about like small business ownership

723
00:31:53.94 --> 00:31:56.02
and like what that means for our economy and such.

724
00:31:56.02 --> 00:31:58.74
But Kerry and Carlin just, they just owned this treatment

725
00:31:58.74 --> 00:32:03.74
center and it was not, it was just a small family owned place

726
00:32:03.74 --> 00:32:06.50
where like people just 100% threw themselves

727
00:32:06.50 --> 00:32:08.14
into helping these families.

728
00:32:08.14 --> 00:32:11.06
And I was drawn to it so much because the families

729
00:32:11.06 --> 00:32:12.94
that were walking through there were definitely

730
00:32:12.94 --> 00:32:15.46
the types of family, like could have been my family, right?

731
00:32:15.46 --> 00:32:19.30
And here I was in this place where really beautiful things

732
00:32:19.30 --> 00:32:21.26
were happening in terms of supporting these people

733
00:32:21.26 --> 00:32:23.06
suffering through very severe things.

734
00:32:23.06 --> 00:32:25.26
I mean, when you have a loved one who has a chronic,

735
00:32:25.26 --> 00:32:27.14
complex psychiatric disorder,

736
00:32:27.14 --> 00:32:28.78
something that you're not getting rid of, right?

737
00:32:28.78 --> 00:32:30.14
We're like making friends with this.

738
00:32:30.14 --> 00:32:32.70
We're learning how to, how to, how to,

739
00:32:32.70 --> 00:32:37.70
how to, you know, accept it, grieve what I thought

740
00:32:38.10 --> 00:32:41.22
was gonna be for my kiddo, you know, whatever it may be.

741
00:32:41.22 --> 00:32:43.78
When a family lets you into their life to like walk

742
00:32:43.78 --> 00:32:46.42
through that path of them is a very special thing.

743
00:32:46.42 --> 00:32:49.06
And I knew at that point like, okay,

744
00:32:49.06 --> 00:32:49.94
this is what I wanna do.

745
00:32:49.94 --> 00:32:51.62
I wanna work with families.

746
00:32:51.62 --> 00:32:55.74
And when I started to realize not only in my own life,

747
00:32:55.74 --> 00:32:58.10
but in what we were doing that we were creating

748
00:32:58.10 --> 00:33:00.86
like generational change, like when you can help

749
00:33:00.86 --> 00:33:05.86
a family system shift away from abuse or addiction

750
00:33:05.86 --> 00:33:10.86
or grief or in a way that allows them to envision

751
00:33:11.14 --> 00:33:13.22
a different identity for themselves.

752
00:33:13.22 --> 00:33:14.26
Like life could be different.

753
00:33:14.26 --> 00:33:17.26
Like we don't actually have to keep going in this way

754
00:33:17.26 --> 00:33:19.50
or continue these patterns.

755
00:33:19.50 --> 00:33:21.98
I mean, you think about the impact of that

756
00:33:21.98 --> 00:33:23.50
for years and years to come.

757
00:33:23.50 --> 00:33:25.02
We're talking about hundreds of people

758
00:33:25.02 --> 00:33:27.74
that could be impacted by one person choosing

759
00:33:27.74 --> 00:33:29.18
to do something different.

760
00:33:29.18 --> 00:33:30.86
That was like everything to me.

761
00:33:30.86 --> 00:33:32.74
And that's what I knew I wanted to do.

762
00:33:32.74 --> 00:33:35.34
And it's what I realized I was able to do for my family

763
00:33:35.34 --> 00:33:37.02
in a lot of ways.

764
00:33:37.02 --> 00:33:41.54
And then this sort of became my family when I was there.

765
00:33:41.54 --> 00:33:44.14
Like just, I was able to be seen in a different way.

766
00:33:44.14 --> 00:33:46.38
It was like, oh, we have this new leadership opportunity.

767
00:33:46.38 --> 00:33:47.22
Like you do it.

768
00:33:47.22 --> 00:33:49.58
And I'm like, me?

769
00:33:49.58 --> 00:33:53.18
And this is an interesting,

770
00:33:53.18 --> 00:33:56.02
this is the kind of the intersection between me and you two,

771
00:33:56.02 --> 00:33:58.98
which is, you know, I got a group of friends

772
00:33:58.98 --> 00:34:01.66
and we invest in a bunch of different things.

773
00:34:01.66 --> 00:34:06.66
And at one point, you know, my buddy Joe said,

774
00:34:06.66 --> 00:34:07.66
hey, we're gonna invest in this.

775
00:34:07.66 --> 00:34:09.06
We're gonna buy some real estate.

776
00:34:09.06 --> 00:34:11.06
And it's gonna be used by this mental health facility.

777
00:34:11.06 --> 00:34:12.18
And I was like, you know, cool.

778
00:34:12.18 --> 00:34:13.94
I mean, literally with them,

779
00:34:13.94 --> 00:34:15.26
they just kind of tell me what,

780
00:34:15.26 --> 00:34:17.42
like they tell me a three minute,

781
00:34:17.42 --> 00:34:18.82
hey, this is what we're putting money into.

782
00:34:18.82 --> 00:34:20.14
I say, cool, give them some money.

783
00:34:20.14 --> 00:34:21.34
We throw it in there.

784
00:34:21.34 --> 00:34:24.86
And at some point we invested in sort of a branch

785
00:34:24.86 --> 00:34:29.18
of Hamletchia and then that branch got swept

786
00:34:29.18 --> 00:34:31.54
into Hamletchia and the whole thing got bought.

787
00:34:31.54 --> 00:34:33.54
And so, you know, we,

788
00:34:33.54 --> 00:34:35.10
it was a cool situation for us.

789
00:34:35.10 --> 00:34:37.38
You know, we made money and high-fived.

790
00:34:37.38 --> 00:34:41.30
And then that eventually rolled into this new venture,

791
00:34:41.30 --> 00:34:44.58
which is the new treatment center, which again,

792
00:34:44.58 --> 00:34:47.14
I mean, I'm just basically like,

793
00:34:47.14 --> 00:34:48.26
I don't wanna say a gambler,

794
00:34:48.26 --> 00:34:49.22
but a little bit of a gambler.

795
00:34:49.22 --> 00:34:50.70
Like you're just letting money roll, you know,

796
00:34:50.70 --> 00:34:52.10
like, oh, just leave it on the table.

797
00:34:52.10 --> 00:34:53.06
And that's kind of what I did.

798
00:34:53.06 --> 00:34:55.22
The next thing, you know, I'm invested in this,

799
00:34:55.22 --> 00:34:56.66
in this new treatment center

800
00:34:56.66 --> 00:34:58.66
and that's all starting to take place.

801
00:34:58.66 --> 00:35:02.82
And so that's kind of how we all know each other

802
00:35:02.82 --> 00:35:05.06
was from that connection, you know,

803
00:35:05.06 --> 00:35:07.86
from me just kind of letting my money sit on the table

804
00:35:07.86 --> 00:35:10.50
and hope it keeps doing well.

805
00:35:10.50 --> 00:35:13.46
That's how we all know each other.

806
00:35:13.46 --> 00:35:17.50
But look, so thank you for your backgrounds.

807
00:35:17.50 --> 00:35:19.82
Definitely, I'm sure we could do a whole podcast

808
00:35:19.82 --> 00:35:21.50
about like each one of your stories

809
00:35:21.50 --> 00:35:23.22
because there's a lot there.

810
00:35:23.22 --> 00:35:27.38
But I wanna kind of get to the topic at hand, right?

811
00:35:27.38 --> 00:35:29.94
Which is me trying to get a better understanding

812
00:35:29.94 --> 00:35:31.42
of mental health issues.

813
00:35:31.42 --> 00:35:34.46
And, you know, we were talking about before hit record

814
00:35:34.46 --> 00:35:38.30
that just different things can hit people so differently.

815
00:35:38.30 --> 00:35:40.66
And two people can experience the same,

816
00:35:40.66 --> 00:35:43.74
literally the same traumatic event

817
00:35:43.74 --> 00:35:46.02
and have totally different reactions.

818
00:35:46.02 --> 00:35:48.34
As you were talking, Megan, I was thinking that

819
00:35:50.14 --> 00:35:51.26
like in SEAL training,

820
00:35:51.26 --> 00:35:53.30
the people that make it through SEAL training

821
00:35:53.30 --> 00:35:55.58
are so radically different.

822
00:35:55.58 --> 00:35:57.26
You've got a kid that grew up with a silver spoon

823
00:35:57.26 --> 00:35:58.78
in his mouth and he makes it through no problem.

824
00:35:58.78 --> 00:35:59.74
You got another kid that makes it,

825
00:35:59.74 --> 00:36:01.86
the silver spoon in his mouth and he quits the first day.

826
00:36:01.86 --> 00:36:04.34
You got someone that grew up on a farm in Iowa

827
00:36:04.34 --> 00:36:05.62
and he makes it through no problem.

828
00:36:05.62 --> 00:36:07.06
Someone else that grew up on a farm in Iowa

829
00:36:07.06 --> 00:36:08.02
and they quit the first day.

830
00:36:08.02 --> 00:36:09.34
And everyone in between,

831
00:36:09.34 --> 00:36:11.50
you got a kid from the ghetto that, you know,

832
00:36:11.50 --> 00:36:14.18
didn't have anything and he just makes it through.

833
00:36:14.18 --> 00:36:15.50
Some other kid from the ghetto first day,

834
00:36:15.50 --> 00:36:16.82
I'm not putting up with this shit.

835
00:36:16.82 --> 00:36:20.06
And that's, so these different lives

836
00:36:20.06 --> 00:36:22.50
can have just a radically different outcome.

837
00:36:23.58 --> 00:36:26.42
What are some of the main causes

838
00:36:26.42 --> 00:36:28.66
of mental health issues?

839
00:36:28.66 --> 00:36:32.26
Like what is, and I know there must be several factors.

840
00:36:32.26 --> 00:36:34.46
I mean, there must be some that are hereditary.

841
00:36:34.46 --> 00:36:36.02
You kind of mentioned that, Karlyn,

842
00:36:36.02 --> 00:36:37.82
like there are some hereditary things

843
00:36:37.82 --> 00:36:39.38
and there must be some things that are brought on

844
00:36:39.38 --> 00:36:42.38
by the environment that you grow up in or what you see.

845
00:36:42.38 --> 00:36:44.66
So what are some of the kind of main causes?

846
00:36:47.14 --> 00:36:49.30
Well, there's, gosh, there's so many.

847
00:36:49.30 --> 00:36:51.86
It's hard to narrow them down.

848
00:36:51.86 --> 00:36:53.30
And like I was saying earlier,

849
00:36:53.30 --> 00:36:55.94
so many of these things are unseen.

850
00:36:55.94 --> 00:36:56.78
They're invisible.

851
00:36:56.78 --> 00:37:00.54
They can't be like located so much on a map, so to speak.

852
00:37:00.54 --> 00:37:02.90
But things like temperament, you know,

853
00:37:02.90 --> 00:37:04.78
like the kind of the traits and characteristics

854
00:37:04.78 --> 00:37:08.42
that we're born with are gonna play a role.

855
00:37:08.42 --> 00:37:10.02
Our upbringing, of course.

856
00:37:10.02 --> 00:37:11.94
Like I'm thinking when you would share that story

857
00:37:11.94 --> 00:37:14.58
about being in Kuwait and I'm like,

858
00:37:14.58 --> 00:37:17.14
I, first of all, I would have never made it there.

859
00:37:17.14 --> 00:37:20.54
But like, I don't think I could have done that.

860
00:37:20.54 --> 00:37:24.26
Now, is it, do I not have a tenacious personality

861
00:37:24.26 --> 00:37:25.10
or perseverance?

862
00:37:25.10 --> 00:37:25.94
No, I've got some of that.

863
00:37:25.94 --> 00:37:28.90
But I think about my early upbringing, right?

864
00:37:28.90 --> 00:37:31.18
Where just living was hard.

865
00:37:31.18 --> 00:37:32.70
Digging a hole to like survive.

866
00:37:32.70 --> 00:37:34.78
That would have been at this whole other level for me.

867
00:37:34.78 --> 00:37:39.78
So my history, so people's histories, messages,

868
00:37:40.42 --> 00:37:42.66
like in the family, like that's a,

869
00:37:42.66 --> 00:37:43.50
and this is my opinion.

870
00:37:43.50 --> 00:37:44.94
What's a message, for example?

871
00:37:44.94 --> 00:37:48.94
Like for example, I like to ask families

872
00:37:48.94 --> 00:37:50.10
or family members sometimes.

873
00:37:50.10 --> 00:37:52.42
So how did you guys do feelings?

874
00:37:53.62 --> 00:37:54.46
Hmm.

875
00:37:54.46 --> 00:37:57.06
What were feelings like?

876
00:37:58.18 --> 00:38:00.66
Most of the time you're gonna have folks say,

877
00:38:00.66 --> 00:38:03.22
oh, we don't talk about feelings.

878
00:38:03.22 --> 00:38:06.38
We don't actually do feelings.

879
00:38:06.38 --> 00:38:10.50
Oh, okay, so when something difficult happens,

880
00:38:10.50 --> 00:38:12.14
you know, you get bullied at school,

881
00:38:12.14 --> 00:38:16.02
your boyfriend breaks up with you,

882
00:38:16.02 --> 00:38:17.10
grandma passes away.

883
00:38:17.10 --> 00:38:18.74
What did you guys do?

884
00:38:20.74 --> 00:38:23.02
Oh, nothing, we just had dinner.

885
00:38:23.02 --> 00:38:23.86
Like, you know, right?

886
00:38:23.86 --> 00:38:26.34
So right here, right, there's something.

887
00:38:26.34 --> 00:38:28.90
A family that didn't acknowledge feelings,

888
00:38:28.90 --> 00:38:32.10
talk about feelings, have a way to process

889
00:38:32.10 --> 00:38:35.66
what was happening is going to have a certain effect

890
00:38:35.66 --> 00:38:37.14
versus the family you ask.

891
00:38:37.14 --> 00:38:38.86
And they're like, oh, we talked about feelings all the time.

892
00:38:38.86 --> 00:38:39.86
Anytime something happened,

893
00:38:39.86 --> 00:38:42.42
we sit down and have a big family meeting about it.

894
00:38:42.42 --> 00:38:45.26
That person is gonna be shaped very differently

895
00:38:45.26 --> 00:38:50.26
in terms of managing stress and managing conflict

896
00:38:50.58 --> 00:38:53.78
and negotiating hardship, right?

897
00:38:53.78 --> 00:38:56.34
So family messages and family,

898
00:38:57.82 --> 00:39:02.30
almost like traditions around things like feelings

899
00:39:02.30 --> 00:39:04.10
or how you handle hardship.

900
00:39:04.10 --> 00:39:07.30
I mean, the book I'm writing right now has a lot to do

901
00:39:07.30 --> 00:39:09.66
with the impact of secrets.

902
00:39:09.66 --> 00:39:13.98
So, and finding that that has a big impact.

903
00:39:13.98 --> 00:39:15.30
Well, I just see it gets in the family.

904
00:39:15.30 --> 00:39:17.06
Secrets like, yeah, like we don't talk.

905
00:39:17.06 --> 00:39:18.50
Like if something happens,

906
00:39:20.14 --> 00:39:21.94
we're just not gonna talk about that.

907
00:39:21.94 --> 00:39:23.66
We're not gonna talk about it amongst ourselves.

908
00:39:23.66 --> 00:39:26.26
We're not gonna share this with the outside world,

909
00:39:26.26 --> 00:39:29.10
under the rug, in the vault, whatever you wanna call it.

910
00:39:29.10 --> 00:39:31.94
So you think about, again,

911
00:39:31.94 --> 00:39:33.86
it's not gonna affect everybody the same way,

912
00:39:33.86 --> 00:39:37.66
but how easy it would be for a person then to develop,

913
00:39:37.66 --> 00:39:39.02
especially if they're young,

914
00:39:39.02 --> 00:39:42.58
this idea that like, oh, when bad things happen

915
00:39:42.58 --> 00:39:43.86
or when difficult things happen,

916
00:39:43.86 --> 00:39:45.46
you're not supposed to talk about that.

917
00:39:45.46 --> 00:39:47.62
You're supposed to keep it to yourself.

918
00:39:47.62 --> 00:39:49.26
Don't share.

919
00:39:49.26 --> 00:39:51.06
So what happens for those folks

920
00:39:51.06 --> 00:39:52.58
who are faced with something difficult

921
00:39:52.58 --> 00:39:53.70
or faced with a hard decision

922
00:39:53.70 --> 00:39:58.26
or faced with a stressful circumstance?

923
00:39:58.26 --> 00:40:01.30
And then it's also so individual

924
00:40:01.30 --> 00:40:06.30
because someone can say, oh, my grandma died

925
00:40:06.30 --> 00:40:09.10
and I'm looking at my dad and he looks stoic.

926
00:40:09.10 --> 00:40:10.70
That seems like a good thing to do.

927
00:40:10.70 --> 00:40:12.82
That seems like a good example, right?

928
00:40:12.82 --> 00:40:16.94
Or, oh, my grandma died and my dad looks stoic.

929
00:40:16.94 --> 00:40:18.50
He doesn't care.

930
00:40:18.50 --> 00:40:21.90
And so it's like your interpretation,

931
00:40:21.90 --> 00:40:23.66
people's individual interpretation.

932
00:40:23.66 --> 00:40:24.78
And even when you were talking, Megan,

933
00:40:24.78 --> 00:40:26.62
like when you joined the military

934
00:40:26.62 --> 00:40:28.94
or even you saw this recruiter

935
00:40:28.94 --> 00:40:31.26
and you kind of say, oh, this guy looks put together.

936
00:40:31.26 --> 00:40:32.70
And you get the military and you're like, okay,

937
00:40:32.70 --> 00:40:34.74
here's what I should be doing.

938
00:40:34.74 --> 00:40:38.50
And like your perception of what you're seeing

939
00:40:38.50 --> 00:40:41.98
and then your decision to say, oh, I can step up.

940
00:40:41.98 --> 00:40:43.26
I can volunteer for this.

941
00:40:43.26 --> 00:40:44.58
I can make this happen.

942
00:40:44.58 --> 00:40:49.18
Like just people's own interaction with reality

943
00:40:49.18 --> 00:40:52.26
and what's going on is so different.

944
00:40:52.26 --> 00:40:56.10
And is there a way that you can take people

945
00:40:56.10 --> 00:40:57.94
and show them the positive one?

946
00:40:57.94 --> 00:40:58.98
Does that work?

947
00:40:58.98 --> 00:41:00.90
Is that a thing to do?

948
00:41:00.90 --> 00:41:01.90
Like let me give you an example.

949
00:41:01.90 --> 00:41:05.18
I have a kids podcast that I do sometimes

950
00:41:05.18 --> 00:41:06.50
and I'll answer kids questions.

951
00:41:06.50 --> 00:41:08.46
I've written a bunch of kids books.

952
00:41:08.46 --> 00:41:10.66
And one of the questions I got one time was from a kid

953
00:41:10.66 --> 00:41:13.70
and I've got multiple forms of this question is,

954
00:41:13.70 --> 00:41:15.66
and this actually reminds me of you, Karlyn.

955
00:41:15.66 --> 00:41:16.90
The question was like, oh,

956
00:41:19.10 --> 00:41:21.26
sometimes kids don't like to hang out with me

957
00:41:21.26 --> 00:41:23.42
and I feel like I'm alone.

958
00:41:25.22 --> 00:41:28.18
How can I feel better about that?

959
00:41:28.18 --> 00:41:30.58
And I answered the question like, hey,

960
00:41:30.58 --> 00:41:32.06
it's okay to be alone.

961
00:41:32.06 --> 00:41:33.38
I'm alone sometimes and it's okay.

962
00:41:33.38 --> 00:41:34.22
Sometimes you're gonna be alone

963
00:41:34.22 --> 00:41:35.54
and you don't always have to have people around you

964
00:41:35.54 --> 00:41:37.54
and it doesn't mean they don't like you.

965
00:41:37.54 --> 00:41:38.50
It doesn't mean you're not gonna have friends.

966
00:41:38.50 --> 00:41:41.78
It's just that sometimes you're alone and that's okay.

967
00:41:41.78 --> 00:41:45.06
And I mean, that's to me is a legitimate answer

968
00:41:45.06 --> 00:41:50.06
because let's say your mom says, why are you alone again?

969
00:41:50.82 --> 00:41:51.98
Why don't you have any friends?

970
00:41:51.98 --> 00:41:54.02
That might start to mess you up.

971
00:41:54.98 --> 00:41:57.34
As opposed to mom saying, oh, what are you reading?

972
00:41:57.34 --> 00:41:58.54
Oh, here's a book.

973
00:41:58.54 --> 00:42:02.70
So how we're interacting and how things,

974
00:42:02.70 --> 00:42:05.54
how you perceive the world can be so different

975
00:42:05.54 --> 00:42:07.74
that these things, and again, you got a kid

976
00:42:07.74 --> 00:42:09.34
that grew up in Iowa that quits

977
00:42:09.34 --> 00:42:11.02
and you got a kid that grew up in Iowa on a farm.

978
00:42:11.02 --> 00:42:12.26
They both grew up in the same exact thing.

979
00:42:12.26 --> 00:42:13.82
One of them quits, one of them makes it.

980
00:42:15.02 --> 00:42:18.90
So do you as therapists, as psychologists,

981
00:42:18.90 --> 00:42:21.90
get to try and guide and open and show those positive things?

982
00:42:21.90 --> 00:42:23.14
Is that what we're doing here?

983
00:42:23.14 --> 00:42:25.94
Well, I think we're trying to create

984
00:42:25.94 --> 00:42:27.38
some reparative experiences

985
00:42:27.38 --> 00:42:29.62
because when you talk about the story of the guy who quit

986
00:42:29.62 --> 00:42:31.70
or the guy who went, I would be really curious

987
00:42:31.70 --> 00:42:34.34
about his history and past around what happened

988
00:42:34.34 --> 00:42:36.94
when he was struggling, when he was having a hard time

989
00:42:36.94 --> 00:42:38.42
or needed to move through something

990
00:42:38.42 --> 00:42:40.02
or didn't know if he could move forward.

991
00:42:40.02 --> 00:42:41.38
What was the response or message

992
00:42:41.38 --> 00:42:42.90
that he received in his environment?

993
00:42:42.90 --> 00:42:45.82
And the thing about some of these aspects of mental health

994
00:42:45.82 --> 00:42:47.78
that are very complex, hard to pinpoint

995
00:42:47.78 --> 00:42:49.18
exactly what needs to be,

996
00:42:49.18 --> 00:42:51.30
but the story that you just told about this child,

997
00:42:51.30 --> 00:42:54.18
that response, when someone chooses to lean in

998
00:42:54.18 --> 00:42:56.38
and be vulnerable in a way and ask a question

999
00:42:56.38 --> 00:42:57.50
or look out for support,

1000
00:42:57.50 --> 00:43:00.10
how we respond to them is pivotal

1001
00:43:00.10 --> 00:43:02.30
because it shapes their experience

1002
00:43:02.30 --> 00:43:04.46
of whether or not that's a safe thing to do again

1003
00:43:04.46 --> 00:43:05.30
in the future.

1004
00:43:05.30 --> 00:43:07.18
So we talk about what cultures

1005
00:43:07.18 --> 00:43:10.14
or what things influence why someone might keep things

1006
00:43:10.14 --> 00:43:12.38
to themselves or be less inclined to share

1007
00:43:12.38 --> 00:43:15.58
or come forward if they're struggling with something

1008
00:43:15.58 --> 00:43:17.78
is how we respond is huge.

1009
00:43:17.78 --> 00:43:20.54
And so there's so much aspects of what's going on

1010
00:43:20.54 --> 00:43:23.02
for another person that we don't actually have control over.

1011
00:43:23.02 --> 00:43:24.22
But what we do have control over

1012
00:43:24.22 --> 00:43:26.62
is sort of our own reaction to

1013
00:43:26.62 --> 00:43:28.54
when someone is sharing something with us

1014
00:43:28.54 --> 00:43:29.94
that appears upsetting,

1015
00:43:30.94 --> 00:43:32.22
do we wanna shut it down

1016
00:43:32.22 --> 00:43:35.22
and kind of they should be fine and get moved past it

1017
00:43:35.22 --> 00:43:36.58
because that creates an experience for them

1018
00:43:36.58 --> 00:43:38.14
or can we kind of tolerate

1019
00:43:38.14 --> 00:43:39.70
whatever feelings are coming up for us

1020
00:43:39.70 --> 00:43:41.42
when we see someone who's struggling

1021
00:43:41.42 --> 00:43:42.70
or with working through something

1022
00:43:42.70 --> 00:43:45.22
that I have no idea how to fix or how to respond to,

1023
00:43:45.22 --> 00:43:47.42
but can I sit with them for enough time

1024
00:43:47.42 --> 00:43:49.78
to create an experience for them

1025
00:43:49.78 --> 00:43:52.54
that lets them know that like,

1026
00:43:52.54 --> 00:43:54.14
if something's coming up for me again

1027
00:43:54.14 --> 00:43:55.06
or if I need to work through this,

1028
00:43:55.06 --> 00:43:56.90
it's safe to come to this person

1029
00:43:56.90 --> 00:43:58.38
or this environment is safe enough

1030
00:43:58.38 --> 00:44:01.06
to be able to share what's going on for me

1031
00:44:01.06 --> 00:44:03.94
because if it's not and that person goes inside,

1032
00:44:03.94 --> 00:44:06.70
then when we look at more severe things like suicide

1033
00:44:06.70 --> 00:44:09.62
or very chronic psychiatric disorders,

1034
00:44:09.62 --> 00:44:12.42
that becomes much more debilitating

1035
00:44:12.42 --> 00:44:15.22
in a way that can cause someone their life.

1036
00:44:17.02 --> 00:44:20.14
I think what you said, I also, I so appreciate what you said.

1037
00:44:20.14 --> 00:44:21.06
Did I give a good answer?

1038
00:44:21.06 --> 00:44:22.78
You did, that was really good.

1039
00:44:22.78 --> 00:44:24.10
Very lucky.

1040
00:44:24.10 --> 00:44:27.26
Of how you responded to the kid, right?

1041
00:44:27.26 --> 00:44:28.82
To me, I'm like, there it is.

1042
00:44:28.82 --> 00:44:29.66
Perfect.

1043
00:44:29.66 --> 00:44:31.54
As opposed to say a mom or somebody else

1044
00:44:31.54 --> 00:44:33.50
that would be like, well, come on, what are you doing wrong?

1045
00:44:33.50 --> 00:44:35.58
How come you don't have any friends?

1046
00:44:35.58 --> 00:44:37.98
Versus like, oh, I'm sorry to hear that bud,

1047
00:44:37.98 --> 00:44:39.14
but you know what, it's okay.

1048
00:44:39.14 --> 00:44:40.86
It's okay sometimes to be alone.

1049
00:44:40.86 --> 00:44:42.94
I'm sorry that you're feeling bad about that today,

1050
00:44:42.94 --> 00:44:44.94
but okay, it's all right.

1051
00:44:44.94 --> 00:44:47.14
There's something about the,

1052
00:44:47.14 --> 00:44:49.22
like I'm just acknowledging what you're going through.

1053
00:44:49.22 --> 00:44:51.42
I'm not trying to change it, I'm not making it wrong,

1054
00:44:51.42 --> 00:44:54.22
I'm not telling you you should be doing something different.

1055
00:44:54.22 --> 00:44:56.70
And that brings out that safety piece.

1056
00:44:56.70 --> 00:44:59.82
And in fact, some research into resiliency.

1057
00:44:59.82 --> 00:45:03.46
So speaking to how come some kids kind of bounce back

1058
00:45:03.46 --> 00:45:07.38
and get better and some kids really flounder over here.

1059
00:45:08.70 --> 00:45:12.66
Some of the research shows that there needs to be opportunities

1060
00:45:12.66 --> 00:45:16.86
to make mistakes and like not be essentially shamed

1061
00:45:16.86 --> 00:45:21.86
or made in trouble, opportunity to fix them,

1062
00:45:21.90 --> 00:45:23.34
which means you gotta use new skills

1063
00:45:23.34 --> 00:45:25.78
and like try and experiment and trial and error.

1064
00:45:25.78 --> 00:45:29.22
And you need to have at least one adult.

1065
00:45:30.22 --> 00:45:31.90
If you got more, that's even better,

1066
00:45:31.90 --> 00:45:36.90
but you need to have one adult that is kind of a safe guide.

1067
00:45:37.50 --> 00:45:40.22
Like somebody that you can feel safe with

1068
00:45:40.22 --> 00:45:42.58
that's gonna kind of get ya and say, you know what, buddy,

1069
00:45:42.58 --> 00:45:44.94
it's all right, sorry, that one did not work out so well,

1070
00:45:44.94 --> 00:45:46.66
we'll try it again tomorrow.

1071
00:45:46.66 --> 00:45:51.62
Versus the shaming, you're wrong, how come you did that?

1072
00:45:51.62 --> 00:45:53.94
You should know better, like those kind of things.

1073
00:45:53.94 --> 00:45:56.94
So resiliency is about having adults, especially as kids,

1074
00:45:56.94 --> 00:45:59.46
having adults that can say, yep, you know what,

1075
00:45:59.46 --> 00:46:02.98
sometimes it's just like that, I'm sorry, but it's okay,

1076
00:46:02.98 --> 00:46:03.82
you'll be fine.

1077
00:46:05.78 --> 00:46:08.06
I had another guy who's a neuroscientist named

1078
00:46:08.06 --> 00:46:11.22
Andrew Huberman on here and we were talking about

1079
00:46:11.22 --> 00:46:12.86
like winning and losing his kids.

1080
00:46:12.86 --> 00:46:15.58
And he said, it's through your whole life,

1081
00:46:15.58 --> 00:46:18.10
you gotta push yourself, you gotta lose sometimes.

1082
00:46:18.10 --> 00:46:20.86
And he actually gave the percentage and he's got research

1083
00:46:20.86 --> 00:46:22.54
or whatever, he's a stamp for doctor,

1084
00:46:22.54 --> 00:46:25.66
so I guess he's smarter, whatever, Andrew.

1085
00:46:25.66 --> 00:46:28.18
But we came down, it's like 80% of the time,

1086
00:46:28.18 --> 00:46:30.02
you want the kid to kind of do well,

1087
00:46:30.02 --> 00:46:32.70
and then 20% of the time, they should like lose.

1088
00:46:32.70 --> 00:46:35.42
If they start, what I did with my kids

1089
00:46:35.42 --> 00:46:38.18
was lose 90% of the time, like put them

1090
00:46:38.18 --> 00:46:41.14
in really hard situations and that's not the good way

1091
00:46:41.14 --> 00:46:41.98
to do it.

1092
00:46:41.98 --> 00:46:44.42
Luckily, my kids turned out pretty resilient.

1093
00:46:44.42 --> 00:46:47.54
But I was just like, oh, you're gonna get beat down,

1094
00:46:47.54 --> 00:46:49.62
it's gonna make you tougher, it's gonna make you stronger.

1095
00:46:49.62 --> 00:46:52.06
And no, what happens is they just start

1096
00:46:52.06 --> 00:46:53.50
to feel like a loser, right?

1097
00:46:53.50 --> 00:46:55.66
So you gotta be careful with that, but that 80%,

1098
00:46:55.66 --> 00:46:58.90
I think it's a good number to, okay, 80% of the time,

1099
00:46:58.90 --> 00:47:00.70
you're winning or you're evenly matched,

1100
00:47:00.70 --> 00:47:02.38
but you're doing well, 20% of the time,

1101
00:47:02.38 --> 00:47:04.62
you gotta be pushing yourself into some situations.

1102
00:47:04.62 --> 00:47:06.66
And that's the weird thing, like the seal training,

1103
00:47:06.66 --> 00:47:10.50
like I'm talking about kids that were Division I wrestlers,

1104
00:47:10.50 --> 00:47:12.34
right, quit.

1105
00:47:12.34 --> 00:47:16.94
Division I wrestling is so insanely hard.

1106
00:47:16.94 --> 00:47:19.86
And they have all kinds of hypothesis, you know,

1107
00:47:19.86 --> 00:47:21.78
somebody that was a really good athlete,

1108
00:47:21.78 --> 00:47:23.94
they've never really been, they've never lost.

1109
00:47:23.94 --> 00:47:25.82
And when you get the seal training, you're gonna lose.

1110
00:47:25.82 --> 00:47:27.90
Like you're gonna fail stuff.

1111
00:47:27.90 --> 00:47:31.34
And so that can be a problem with people's mentality

1112
00:47:31.34 --> 00:47:32.86
because they've just never lost before.

1113
00:47:32.86 --> 00:47:35.26
And then there's some kid that's been getting beat down

1114
00:47:35.26 --> 00:47:37.86
this whole life, he's like, oh, cool, I failed, whatever,

1115
00:47:37.86 --> 00:47:38.98
I'm gonna keep going.

1116
00:47:38.98 --> 00:47:43.98
So how do you diagnose, you know, again,

1117
00:47:44.26 --> 00:47:45.66
I made the car mechanic thing.

1118
00:47:45.66 --> 00:47:49.02
And the cool thing, the interesting thing about this metaphor

1119
00:47:49.02 --> 00:47:50.62
is even a car mechanic, you bring a car

1120
00:47:50.62 --> 00:47:54.90
and there's a whatever, a tapping noise in the engine.

1121
00:47:54.90 --> 00:47:57.22
He doesn't necessarily know 100%, what is it?

1122
00:47:57.22 --> 00:47:58.74
He's like, ah, it could be this, could be that.

1123
00:47:58.74 --> 00:47:59.90
He's gotta dig in there.

1124
00:47:59.90 --> 00:48:03.42
So is that the way diagnosis works?

1125
00:48:03.42 --> 00:48:07.18
You're sort of like, okay, here's a problem,

1126
00:48:07.18 --> 00:48:09.78
you're getting super emotional.

1127
00:48:09.78 --> 00:48:11.18
We don't know what's causing it yet,

1128
00:48:11.18 --> 00:48:12.14
that's the tapping, right?

1129
00:48:12.14 --> 00:48:13.26
You're getting super emotional.

1130
00:48:13.26 --> 00:48:14.90
And then what are we doing to diagnose?

1131
00:48:14.90 --> 00:48:15.90
How does it happen?

1132
00:48:18.82 --> 00:48:23.26
Pretty much, I mean, it is a, let's look over here.

1133
00:48:23.26 --> 00:48:25.30
Oh, that doesn't really seem to be the problem.

1134
00:48:25.30 --> 00:48:26.50
Let's try this over here.

1135
00:48:26.50 --> 00:48:28.50
Now personally, what I have found is,

1136
00:48:28.50 --> 00:48:31.70
and not everybody works this way, this is totally fine,

1137
00:48:31.70 --> 00:48:36.70
is I like to go into like, how did you get here?

1138
00:48:36.70 --> 00:48:38.46
Right, so I'm gonna ask all kinds of questions

1139
00:48:38.46 --> 00:48:40.74
about what happened in the family

1140
00:48:40.74 --> 00:48:42.26
and how were things talked about

1141
00:48:42.26 --> 00:48:44.38
and what did you experience

1142
00:48:44.38 --> 00:48:46.06
and how was that managed in the family?

1143
00:48:46.06 --> 00:48:49.26
Because I see those things as they shape.

1144
00:48:49.26 --> 00:48:52.10
So now we have this tapping that's happening right now

1145
00:48:52.10 --> 00:48:55.26
where there's something probably that went on back then

1146
00:48:55.26 --> 00:48:56.54
that has to do with it.

1147
00:48:56.54 --> 00:48:59.26
Some therapists, some psychologists don't,

1148
00:49:00.26 --> 00:49:01.70
they look at like what's happening right now

1149
00:49:01.70 --> 00:49:02.94
and how do we move it forward?

1150
00:49:02.94 --> 00:49:04.82
They are not gonna spend a lot of time in the past,

1151
00:49:04.82 --> 00:49:07.98
it's preference, but I mean, I can't tell you

1152
00:49:07.98 --> 00:49:10.86
how many times what walked through the door

1153
00:49:10.86 --> 00:49:12.34
is not what we ended up finding.

1154
00:49:12.34 --> 00:49:14.42
Sure, right, somebody, I mean,

1155
00:49:14.42 --> 00:49:17.58
some of my earlier years in private practice,

1156
00:49:17.58 --> 00:49:19.46
I worked a lot with eating disorders

1157
00:49:19.46 --> 00:49:22.90
and because I was also still learning

1158
00:49:22.90 --> 00:49:25.26
and didn't have as much experience

1159
00:49:25.26 --> 00:49:27.98
as I would have within a few years as,

1160
00:49:27.98 --> 00:49:31.50
oh, it's meal plan, this person is afraid of getting fat.

1161
00:49:31.50 --> 00:49:34.34
This person thinks they're more popular

1162
00:49:34.34 --> 00:49:36.50
but they're skinny, whatever, all of these things.

1163
00:49:36.50 --> 00:49:39.58
So we would kind of target those behaviors.

1164
00:49:39.58 --> 00:49:41.02
Let's get you on a good meal plan,

1165
00:49:41.02 --> 00:49:44.70
let's talk about self-esteem, et cetera, et cetera.

1166
00:49:44.70 --> 00:49:48.70
Over the years, it was kind of insane

1167
00:49:48.70 --> 00:49:51.82
how much I discovered through looking back,

1168
00:49:51.82 --> 00:49:53.86
like there was trauma in there

1169
00:49:53.86 --> 00:49:58.06
or some kind of really defining event

1170
00:49:58.06 --> 00:50:00.58
that happened in that young person's life,

1171
00:50:00.58 --> 00:50:04.10
that the eating disorder behaviors, so to speak,

1172
00:50:04.10 --> 00:50:07.62
were almost like the manifestation of something else.

1173
00:50:07.62 --> 00:50:10.26
What kind of, what would be a something else?

1174
00:50:10.26 --> 00:50:15.02
Like abuse, like often, especially with girls,

1175
00:50:15.02 --> 00:50:17.82
you'd see like a sexual assault or sexual abuse.

1176
00:50:19.30 --> 00:50:20.98
Sometimes that's something that was happening

1177
00:50:20.98 --> 00:50:23.62
in the family that was not being talked about,

1178
00:50:23.62 --> 00:50:27.34
would be kind of stuffed down

1179
00:50:27.34 --> 00:50:30.78
and then expressed through these behaviors.

1180
00:50:30.78 --> 00:50:34.14
So almost psychologically, you can interpret that

1181
00:50:34.14 --> 00:50:36.54
a little bit as if we're spending all of our time over here

1182
00:50:36.54 --> 00:50:38.90
on meal plans and weight gain and weight loss,

1183
00:50:38.90 --> 00:50:40.86
what are we not looking at?

1184
00:50:40.86 --> 00:50:43.82
The secret over here that nobody wants to talk about.

1185
00:50:43.82 --> 00:50:46.82
So sometimes finding an origin

1186
00:50:49.02 --> 00:50:52.54
that then explains the symptoms,

1187
00:50:52.54 --> 00:50:55.18
then you treat the origin, the issue over here

1188
00:50:55.18 --> 00:50:58.58
versus the symptoms, kind of like the analogy

1189
00:50:58.58 --> 00:51:01.14
I've used a million times, even with clients, is

1190
00:51:01.14 --> 00:51:05.54
if you come in with like a severe case of pneumonia

1191
00:51:05.54 --> 00:51:07.02
and the only thing we're doing

1192
00:51:07.02 --> 00:51:11.02
is giving you some cough syrup to help your cough,

1193
00:51:11.02 --> 00:51:12.58
like that's gonna help a little bit.

1194
00:51:12.58 --> 00:51:14.66
I mean, it's gonna help you feel a tiny bit better,

1195
00:51:14.66 --> 00:51:17.34
but nothing, in fact, you might even get worse

1196
00:51:17.34 --> 00:51:19.94
if we don't really treat the thing

1197
00:51:19.94 --> 00:51:22.14
that's really underneath the cough.

1198
00:51:22.14 --> 00:51:24.70
Like the cough actually is not really the issue.

1199
00:51:24.70 --> 00:51:25.62
This is the other thing.

1200
00:51:25.62 --> 00:51:27.66
Yeah, this is the really humanizing part

1201
00:51:27.66 --> 00:51:29.10
in terms of what you're talking about,

1202
00:51:29.10 --> 00:51:31.10
because I think we have to be really mindful

1203
00:51:31.10 --> 00:51:34.34
and responsible as clinicians with how we talk

1204
00:51:34.34 --> 00:51:36.06
about the use of diagnoses.

1205
00:51:36.06 --> 00:51:38.58
In my private practice, I often get people coming to me

1206
00:51:38.58 --> 00:51:40.22
that it's their first time they've reached out

1207
00:51:40.22 --> 00:51:42.38
for mental health services, they've gone somewhere,

1208
00:51:42.38 --> 00:51:45.10
and they spent just a short meeting with someone

1209
00:51:45.10 --> 00:51:47.02
and they were given a diagnosis by polar disorder.

1210
00:51:47.02 --> 00:51:48.66
Something that's very severe.

1211
00:51:48.66 --> 00:51:50.46
They go look this up on the internet,

1212
00:51:50.46 --> 00:51:53.10
they start attaching all these things to their personality.

1213
00:51:53.10 --> 00:51:54.18
The web MD.

1214
00:51:54.18 --> 00:51:57.62
And now I am bipolar disorder.

1215
00:51:57.62 --> 00:52:00.42
I start to attach these things to my personality.

1216
00:52:00.42 --> 00:52:03.06
And that language is very powerful over time,

1217
00:52:03.06 --> 00:52:05.54
because if I am something or something is happening to me,

1218
00:52:05.54 --> 00:52:07.78
I have much less control over how I respond to it

1219
00:52:07.78 --> 00:52:11.38
as opposed to this idea that I'm experiencing

1220
00:52:11.38 --> 00:52:14.54
some symptoms associated with bipolar disorder,

1221
00:52:14.54 --> 00:52:16.94
or I'm experiencing some symptoms associated with this.

1222
00:52:16.94 --> 00:52:21.94
Or after some reflection, I have an addressed trauma

1223
00:52:21.94 --> 00:52:25.70
in my past that's showing up like very volatile outbursts

1224
00:52:25.70 --> 00:52:26.62
or something like that.

1225
00:52:26.62 --> 00:52:30.34
And so I think how we talk about it is really important.

1226
00:52:31.54 --> 00:52:34.02
Because nowadays, and if you have kids my age,

1227
00:52:34.02 --> 00:52:36.34
there's plenty of kids walking around self-diagnosed

1228
00:52:36.34 --> 00:52:39.30
as OCD or depression or these sorts of things,

1229
00:52:39.30 --> 00:52:41.02
because they hear about something and I am this

1230
00:52:41.02 --> 00:52:42.94
and I can't do this because I have this.

1231
00:52:42.94 --> 00:52:46.42
And so I think one of the first things we try to do

1232
00:52:46.42 --> 00:52:49.98
with people is start to talk about the impact and history,

1233
00:52:49.98 --> 00:52:52.46
because it allows us to create a framework to talk about things

1234
00:52:52.46 --> 00:52:54.10
that are more humanizing,

1235
00:52:54.10 --> 00:52:59.10
as opposed to the symptoms or like a label.

1236
00:53:00.06 --> 00:53:03.58
So this made me think of something that I said a while ago.

1237
00:53:04.54 --> 00:53:07.02
I looked up the definition of being insane.

1238
00:53:07.02 --> 00:53:10.54
And being insane was when your reality

1239
00:53:10.54 --> 00:53:12.94
doesn't match the reality of the world.

1240
00:53:12.94 --> 00:53:15.50
And we have an online training program

1241
00:53:15.50 --> 00:53:18.54
and I was telling you, I said, hey, everyone is insane.

1242
00:53:18.54 --> 00:53:20.26
Everyone is to some level insane,

1243
00:53:20.26 --> 00:53:23.98
because if the three of us witness an event

1244
00:53:23.98 --> 00:53:25.26
or participate in an event,

1245
00:53:25.26 --> 00:53:26.74
it's gonna be a little bit different for all of us.

1246
00:53:26.74 --> 00:53:29.10
Like our reality is gonna be a little bit different.

1247
00:53:29.10 --> 00:53:32.42
Well, no, you said this, I didn't say that, I said this.

1248
00:53:32.42 --> 00:53:34.50
So we're gonna have different interpretations of reality.

1249
00:53:34.50 --> 00:53:37.78
So everyone therefore is a little bit insane, right?

1250
00:53:37.78 --> 00:53:41.50
And it's just how insane are you?

1251
00:53:41.50 --> 00:53:44.26
And when you start looking at that,

1252
00:53:44.26 --> 00:53:49.26
like the most horrifying thing, like anorexia,

1253
00:53:49.26 --> 00:53:54.26
where the person is so clearly malnutritioned

1254
00:53:56.66 --> 00:54:01.66
and so clearly like 100% of people in the world

1255
00:54:01.66 --> 00:54:04.18
would say you need to eat more.

1256
00:54:04.18 --> 00:54:07.58
And that one person, the person that has it,

1257
00:54:07.58 --> 00:54:10.18
just they just don't see that.

1258
00:54:10.18 --> 00:54:14.98
That's gotta be the scariest, scariest environment.

1259
00:54:14.98 --> 00:54:17.66
Like for a parent, I can't even fathom

1260
00:54:17.66 --> 00:54:19.26
what that's doing.

1261
00:54:20.86 --> 00:54:23.30
So as you're talking about, Karlyn,

1262
00:54:23.30 --> 00:54:26.10
you're talking about addressing the,

1263
00:54:26.10 --> 00:54:30.06
like finding this original, this initial problem.

1264
00:54:30.06 --> 00:54:34.46
And that's how we're able to address that,

1265
00:54:34.46 --> 00:54:37.34
bring that into the light, get that thing solved,

1266
00:54:37.34 --> 00:54:40.06
and it solves the symptom that we're all seeing.

1267
00:54:40.06 --> 00:54:40.90
Pretty much.

1268
00:54:40.90 --> 00:54:42.78
I mean, and that's the mechanic work, right?

1269
00:54:42.78 --> 00:54:44.22
Is you're kind of digging.

1270
00:54:44.22 --> 00:54:47.34
And sometimes the person will know,

1271
00:54:47.34 --> 00:54:49.18
like I had this thing happen,

1272
00:54:49.18 --> 00:54:51.18
and I think my symptoms are related to this.

1273
00:54:51.18 --> 00:54:53.06
Sometimes they're not aware.

1274
00:54:53.06 --> 00:54:56.38
I had a young girl that I was treating for anorexia.

1275
00:54:56.38 --> 00:54:59.22
She was a cheerleader and a ballerina.

1276
00:54:59.22 --> 00:55:01.46
So much pressure, right?

1277
00:55:01.46 --> 00:55:05.98
To maintain this very malnourished, very thin body

1278
00:55:05.98 --> 00:55:08.46
and all the guilt, like even eating something

1279
00:55:08.46 --> 00:55:11.02
that had a carb in it, just like, I can't,

1280
00:55:11.02 --> 00:55:13.06
I'm gonna get fathom, I'm not gonna get picked.

1281
00:55:13.06 --> 00:55:18.06
I'm so destructive and interfering with life.

1282
00:55:18.54 --> 00:55:20.70
So I'm working with her and I'm trying

1283
00:55:20.70 --> 00:55:21.98
the end this thing and this thing,

1284
00:55:21.98 --> 00:55:22.94
and we're trying it over here,

1285
00:55:22.94 --> 00:55:24.62
and I don't know, your worth isn't wrapped up

1286
00:55:24.62 --> 00:55:25.86
in your ballerina stuff.

1287
00:55:25.86 --> 00:55:26.70
Nothing was happening.

1288
00:55:26.70 --> 00:55:28.42
So you are focused on the physical life.

1289
00:55:28.42 --> 00:55:29.26
At the time.

1290
00:55:29.26 --> 00:55:30.10
You look fine.

1291
00:55:30.10 --> 00:55:32.34
Because this is all she was presenting with is like,

1292
00:55:32.34 --> 00:55:34.78
I know, like it's almost like, I know,

1293
00:55:34.78 --> 00:55:36.18
this is not good for me,

1294
00:55:36.18 --> 00:55:37.62
I just don't really know what to do about it.

1295
00:55:37.62 --> 00:55:39.38
But there wasn't really much else.

1296
00:55:39.38 --> 00:55:41.22
Try getting the parents in, they didn't wanna come in,

1297
00:55:41.22 --> 00:55:44.38
which really should have been my first clue.

1298
00:55:44.38 --> 00:55:47.10
And long story short, just to get to this point,

1299
00:55:47.10 --> 00:55:50.38
is months and months of meeting with her and like,

1300
00:55:50.38 --> 00:55:51.22
well, what about this?

1301
00:55:51.22 --> 00:55:52.78
And I don't know, what about that?

1302
00:55:52.78 --> 00:55:57.78
She says, well, you know, my mom said,

1303
00:55:57.90 --> 00:56:00.34
she didn't want me to talk about this.

1304
00:56:00.34 --> 00:56:02.86
But I feel like I should.

1305
00:56:02.86 --> 00:56:06.34
I think I was molested by my cousin when I was like 12.

1306
00:56:06.34 --> 00:56:09.78
I'm like, oh, so I'm like, here we go.

1307
00:56:09.78 --> 00:56:11.58
So I'm asking her all these questions.

1308
00:56:11.58 --> 00:56:16.50
And she just tells this really very sad,

1309
00:56:17.58 --> 00:56:21.06
kind of horrible story about learning that she,

1310
00:56:21.06 --> 00:56:23.66
like learning something at school that made her think,

1311
00:56:23.66 --> 00:56:25.90
oh my God, I think that happened to me.

1312
00:56:25.90 --> 00:56:28.82
Going home, telling her parents and her parents like,

1313
00:56:28.82 --> 00:56:30.46
do not tell anybody about this,

1314
00:56:30.46 --> 00:56:33.14
this is gonna ruin everybody's life, la, la, la, la.

1315
00:56:33.14 --> 00:56:35.58
Right, just don't talk about it.

1316
00:56:35.58 --> 00:56:37.62
Well, no, she's a ballerina.

1317
00:56:37.62 --> 00:56:40.98
Right, like all that got stuffed down

1318
00:56:40.98 --> 00:56:44.38
and kind of channeled in this way that she could control

1319
00:56:44.38 --> 00:56:48.18
her environment a lot of time, a lot of the time.

1320
00:56:48.18 --> 00:56:51.34
So we start unpacking this and it turns out,

1321
00:56:51.34 --> 00:56:54.38
as she tells me about this event that made her think

1322
00:56:54.38 --> 00:56:57.22
that she might have been molested, that's not what happened.

1323
00:56:57.22 --> 00:57:00.30
She was in some class at school

1324
00:57:00.30 --> 00:57:01.74
and they were talking about something

1325
00:57:01.74 --> 00:57:05.26
and she like almost like misinterpreted.

1326
00:57:05.26 --> 00:57:08.06
So this, for years, there was this whole thing

1327
00:57:08.06 --> 00:57:09.18
that had happened in her family

1328
00:57:09.18 --> 00:57:10.98
where she said she had been molested,

1329
00:57:10.98 --> 00:57:12.88
but she really wasn't.

1330
00:57:14.02 --> 00:57:16.82
They thought she was, shut it down,

1331
00:57:16.82 --> 00:57:18.90
didn't let anybody talk about it,

1332
00:57:18.90 --> 00:57:20.50
and now she's coming in for treatment

1333
00:57:20.50 --> 00:57:23.02
for anxiety and an eating disorder, right?

1334
00:57:23.02 --> 00:57:26.30
Soon as we got there and we got it and she was,

1335
00:57:26.30 --> 00:57:27.66
I mean, she bought in, she was like,

1336
00:57:27.66 --> 00:57:30.10
oh my God, I had no idea, at this point she's maybe 18.

1337
00:57:30.10 --> 00:57:32.30
I think I started seeing her, she was just 15.

1338
00:57:32.30 --> 00:57:37.10
Like all of a sudden, it was like all that symptomology

1339
00:57:37.10 --> 00:57:38.70
went away.

1340
00:57:38.70 --> 00:57:40.14
I mean, it didn't vanish overnight

1341
00:57:40.14 --> 00:57:42.94
because she'd been doing those behaviors for a long time,

1342
00:57:42.94 --> 00:57:46.82
but that clarity of like, oh, this is what this was about.

1343
00:57:46.82 --> 00:57:50.14
This being made to be wrong.

1344
00:57:50.14 --> 00:57:52.26
I thought this bad thing had happened to me

1345
00:57:52.26 --> 00:57:56.18
and I was like essentially punished for it

1346
00:57:56.18 --> 00:57:59.22
and told that if I tell and something happens to my cousin,

1347
00:57:59.22 --> 00:58:01.18
it's gonna be my fault.

1348
00:58:01.18 --> 00:58:03.46
So not being able to talk about it,

1349
00:58:03.46 --> 00:58:06.46
being told by her mom, don't go talk about this in therapy.

1350
00:58:07.62 --> 00:58:08.86
She wouldn't go to therapy for, right?

1351
00:58:08.86 --> 00:58:11.98
But it was that, like that's an example of you kind of,

1352
00:58:11.98 --> 00:58:14.50
we just had to peel and peel and ask questions

1353
00:58:14.50 --> 00:58:17.46
and when we found it, it cleared up.

1354
00:58:17.46 --> 00:58:18.54
Because right, like you said,

1355
00:58:18.54 --> 00:58:20.78
like it kind of brought it into the light.

1356
00:58:20.78 --> 00:58:23.74
We could address what the real problem was

1357
00:58:23.74 --> 00:58:27.14
and then the symptoms, the cough, so to speak,

1358
00:58:27.14 --> 00:58:30.70
alleviated because the root, the core,

1359
00:58:30.70 --> 00:58:31.82
had been addressed.

1360
00:58:31.82 --> 00:58:36.66
So there is a lot in psychological practice and treatment

1361
00:58:36.66 --> 00:58:38.74
that does involve some...

1362
00:58:38.74 --> 00:58:41.34
And it took you years, three years to get through this.

1363
00:58:41.34 --> 00:58:42.38
I saw her every week.

1364
00:58:43.82 --> 00:58:46.86
Because she, and she was really like,

1365
00:58:48.10 --> 00:58:50.46
I was told not to talk about this.

1366
00:58:51.26 --> 00:58:54.14
So she kind of knew something was back there,

1367
00:58:54.14 --> 00:58:57.14
but she was also young and had been directed

1368
00:58:57.14 --> 00:58:59.02
by her family, don't talk about this.

1369
00:58:59.02 --> 00:59:01.22
If you talk about this and she calls the school

1370
00:59:01.22 --> 00:59:04.38
and your cousin gets in trouble, then Aunt and Uncle,

1371
00:59:04.38 --> 00:59:07.58
or like, you know, so just...

1372
00:59:07.58 --> 00:59:10.42
But it was, what was, if you can go into it a little bit,

1373
00:59:10.42 --> 00:59:12.46
like, well, you, because you said it didn't really happen,

1374
00:59:12.46 --> 00:59:13.42
but she thought it happened.

1375
00:59:13.42 --> 00:59:15.34
Well, yeah, so she said she was at school one day

1376
00:59:15.34 --> 00:59:17.34
and they were doing one of these assemblies, right?

1377
00:59:17.34 --> 00:59:18.98
Where you're giving like the kids education

1378
00:59:18.98 --> 00:59:21.38
on healthy touch and inappropriate touch.

1379
00:59:21.38 --> 00:59:24.58
Like, just, you know, maybe she's 15 at this time.

1380
00:59:24.58 --> 00:59:27.54
She was also a very immature, only child,

1381
00:59:27.54 --> 00:59:30.74
a little bit sheltered, so maturity-wise,

1382
00:59:30.74 --> 00:59:34.22
she was a little, little behind, I think.

1383
00:59:34.22 --> 00:59:37.38
And so she said, so this thing was happening

1384
00:59:37.38 --> 00:59:38.70
and I told my friend, oh my God,

1385
00:59:38.70 --> 00:59:40.18
I think I might have been molested

1386
00:59:40.18 --> 00:59:42.14
because this thing happened with my cousin.

1387
00:59:42.14 --> 00:59:44.82
So I'm like, okay, so can you tell me what happened

1388
00:59:44.82 --> 00:59:45.94
with your cousin?

1389
00:59:45.94 --> 00:59:49.66
So she tells me this event, which was really like,

1390
00:59:51.62 --> 00:59:54.22
at a party one night, like all the cousins

1391
00:59:54.22 --> 00:59:57.34
and aunts and uncles, the kids decided to like,

1392
00:59:57.34 --> 00:59:59.82
play a joke and like, skinny dip.

1393
00:59:59.82 --> 01:00:01.14
Like, they all went into the pool house,

1394
01:00:01.14 --> 01:00:02.86
like, stripped off their clothes and like,

1395
01:00:02.86 --> 01:00:06.34
ran into the pool and made a big joke

1396
01:00:06.34 --> 01:00:07.58
and everyone got in trouble

1397
01:00:07.58 --> 01:00:09.26
because the parents were there and this kind of thing.

1398
01:00:09.26 --> 01:00:11.10
And she goes, it was my cousin's idea.

1399
01:00:11.10 --> 01:00:12.06
So, okay.

1400
01:00:13.34 --> 01:00:15.66
She goes, so he molested me, right?

1401
01:00:15.66 --> 01:00:18.66
I'm like, what?

1402
01:00:18.66 --> 01:00:20.10
What?

1403
01:00:20.10 --> 01:00:21.18
In her mind.

1404
01:00:21.18 --> 01:00:24.42
She had, because she heard this thing at school

1405
01:00:24.42 --> 01:00:25.42
and her friend said, oh my God,

1406
01:00:25.42 --> 01:00:27.58
it was your cousin that said you should take off your bathing.

1407
01:00:27.58 --> 01:00:28.74
So I think that's molest.

1408
01:00:28.74 --> 01:00:29.98
I think that's inappropriate, whatever.

1409
01:00:29.98 --> 01:00:32.30
Like it grew into this thing.

1410
01:00:32.30 --> 01:00:34.70
But when she really, when we went back

1411
01:00:34.70 --> 01:00:35.54
and walked through the event,

1412
01:00:35.54 --> 01:00:37.46
she goes, well, no, it was, it was my cousin's idea.

1413
01:00:37.46 --> 01:00:38.94
But like, we all did it.

1414
01:00:38.94 --> 01:00:41.26
No one touched anybody.

1415
01:00:41.26 --> 01:00:43.22
It was, we thought it would be funny.

1416
01:00:43.22 --> 01:00:45.06
So tragic.

1417
01:00:45.06 --> 01:00:48.30
I mean, this is, this, to me, and she did,

1418
01:00:48.30 --> 01:00:49.94
once we got there, she did beautifully.

1419
01:00:49.94 --> 01:00:51.10
She's off at college.

1420
01:00:51.10 --> 01:00:55.26
I mean, doing wonderfully, but the years, right?

1421
01:00:55.26 --> 01:00:57.66
Of a misunderstanding of something that happened.

1422
01:00:57.66 --> 01:00:59.86
It was all like the telephone game, right?

1423
01:00:59.86 --> 01:01:02.22
She told this person, they told this,

1424
01:01:02.22 --> 01:01:04.74
it just by the time it arrived at her parents,

1425
01:01:04.74 --> 01:01:06.86
it was this whole other thing.

1426
01:01:06.86 --> 01:01:07.70
Scary.

1427
01:01:07.70 --> 01:01:08.66
So scary.

1428
01:01:08.66 --> 01:01:10.06
Megan, something you were talking about

1429
01:01:10.06 --> 01:01:11.90
when you were talking about,

1430
01:01:11.90 --> 01:01:14.78
oh, people kind of self-diagnosed at some point

1431
01:01:14.78 --> 01:01:17.10
where they get a diagnosis from somebody.

1432
01:01:17.10 --> 01:01:20.74
And oh yeah, we had a friend of mine on here.

1433
01:01:20.74 --> 01:01:23.82
There's an ancient native American saying

1434
01:01:23.82 --> 01:01:25.70
that something along the lines of,

1435
01:01:26.74 --> 01:01:29.58
it's not a diagnosis, it's a curse.

1436
01:01:29.58 --> 01:01:31.42
Like if you get diagnosed with something

1437
01:01:31.42 --> 01:01:34.78
and you can hear it as a curse, like this is what you are.

1438
01:01:36.82 --> 01:01:40.62
How much play does it give to me?

1439
01:01:40.62 --> 01:01:41.70
I mean, well, obviously I wrote a book

1440
01:01:41.70 --> 01:01:43.30
called Extreme Ownership, Taking Ownership,

1441
01:01:43.30 --> 01:01:45.18
of like what's going on in your world.

1442
01:01:45.18 --> 01:01:48.82
And instead of being, oh, I'm bipolar, that's what I am.

1443
01:01:48.82 --> 01:01:50.46
It's like, no, I have some symptoms

1444
01:01:50.46 --> 01:01:52.86
and here's how I'm gonna get control of this.

1445
01:01:52.86 --> 01:01:55.26
Is that something that comes into play

1446
01:01:55.26 --> 01:01:58.30
in getting people moving in the right direction?

1447
01:01:58.30 --> 01:02:00.06
I would say absolutely yes.

1448
01:02:00.06 --> 01:02:02.78
I mean, because what we're trying to do is help people

1449
01:02:04.06 --> 01:02:06.46
identify differently with what's happening in their life

1450
01:02:06.46 --> 01:02:08.10
or create a new narrative or story

1451
01:02:08.10 --> 01:02:09.62
around what's going on in their life.

1452
01:02:09.62 --> 01:02:12.82
So, I mean, this happens not just with the individual,

1453
01:02:12.82 --> 01:02:14.06
but with families, right?

1454
01:02:14.06 --> 01:02:16.34
Like if I'm, if I hear that my kiddo

1455
01:02:16.34 --> 01:02:18.38
who's historically done really well,

1456
01:02:18.38 --> 01:02:20.38
they're talented, they've done it well in music,

1457
01:02:20.38 --> 01:02:21.94
all through high school, all of a sudden they're in their

1458
01:02:21.94 --> 01:02:23.30
first or second year of college

1459
01:02:23.30 --> 01:02:24.30
and they're starting to display

1460
01:02:24.30 --> 01:02:27.02
some really interesting symptoms.

1461
01:02:27.02 --> 01:02:28.54
They have their first psychotic break.

1462
01:02:28.54 --> 01:02:30.10
It's like devastating for a family.

1463
01:02:30.10 --> 01:02:31.18
Like what happened?

1464
01:02:31.18 --> 01:02:32.94
It's very common or on that age frame

1465
01:02:32.94 --> 01:02:34.62
for something like this to happen.

1466
01:02:35.86 --> 01:02:39.18
All of these ideas start coming up.

1467
01:02:39.18 --> 01:02:40.66
My son has schizophrenia.

1468
01:02:40.66 --> 01:02:42.50
He'll never be able to get married.

1469
01:02:42.50 --> 01:02:45.54
He'll never be able to hold down a job.

1470
01:02:45.54 --> 01:02:48.22
We're never gonna see our son graduate from college.

1471
01:02:48.22 --> 01:02:50.06
We're not gonna be able to do the family vacations.

1472
01:02:50.06 --> 01:02:52.10
You just say it just goes on and on.

1473
01:02:52.10 --> 01:02:53.34
And so you sit with these families

1474
01:02:53.34 --> 01:02:56.10
and there's just such a sense of hopelessness.

1475
01:02:56.10 --> 01:03:00.30
And so what we try to do is come back a little bit to say,

1476
01:03:00.30 --> 01:03:03.14
like, well, you know, why don't you think

1477
01:03:03.14 --> 01:03:05.02
he's able to live alone?

1478
01:03:05.02 --> 01:03:07.50
Well, he hasn't taken out the trash all week.

1479
01:03:07.50 --> 01:03:08.86
His room is a mess.

1480
01:03:08.86 --> 01:03:10.62
He stays in there all by himself.

1481
01:03:10.62 --> 01:03:12.82
Well, how come, how was he able to do that?

1482
01:03:12.82 --> 01:03:15.34
Like how was he able to sit in his room all day

1483
01:03:15.34 --> 01:03:17.30
and like not experience the natural consequences?

1484
01:03:17.30 --> 01:03:18.66
So say, if I went in my room all day,

1485
01:03:18.66 --> 01:03:21.06
stop going to school or work or whatever it may be,

1486
01:03:21.06 --> 01:03:22.18
like things would fall apart in my life.

1487
01:03:22.18 --> 01:03:23.38
How is that able to happen?

1488
01:03:23.38 --> 01:03:26.26
And so what we can get to,

1489
01:03:26.26 --> 01:03:27.94
and this takes a lot of time,

1490
01:03:27.94 --> 01:03:30.06
is essentially the fear associated with like,

1491
01:03:30.06 --> 01:03:32.74
if I was to push him towards something

1492
01:03:32.74 --> 01:03:35.86
or if he's not capable or because of this illness,

1493
01:03:35.86 --> 01:03:36.86
now he can't do this.

1494
01:03:36.86 --> 01:03:37.90
And we have to really unpack,

1495
01:03:37.90 --> 01:03:39.30
and it's different for every family,

1496
01:03:39.30 --> 01:03:41.66
but we have to really unpack that to figure out

1497
01:03:41.66 --> 01:03:44.30
what it is that they've decided collectively.

1498
01:03:44.30 --> 01:03:46.10
This means for their life, right?

1499
01:03:46.10 --> 01:03:47.38
These symptoms or this diagnosis,

1500
01:03:47.38 --> 01:03:49.06
and then help them envision something

1501
01:03:49.06 --> 01:03:50.46
sort of different for themselves.

1502
01:03:50.46 --> 01:03:54.14
And then create experiences for individuals to play that out.

1503
01:03:54.14 --> 01:03:56.22
Well, he's been taking out the trash all week here,

1504
01:03:56.22 --> 01:03:58.10
and if he doesn't, his peer tells them like,

1505
01:03:58.10 --> 01:03:59.62
hey, you didn't take out the trash,

1506
01:03:59.62 --> 01:04:00.70
and so go do that,

1507
01:04:00.70 --> 01:04:04.46
or experience some of the natural consequences

1508
01:04:04.46 --> 01:04:05.78
associated with IFI,

1509
01:04:05.78 --> 01:04:08.22
just leave my stuff everywhere.

1510
01:04:08.22 --> 01:04:10.02
You know, my roommate tells me like,

1511
01:04:10.02 --> 01:04:11.86
hey, you know, room like stinks,

1512
01:04:11.86 --> 01:04:13.02
can you like clean this up?

1513
01:04:13.02 --> 01:04:14.66
Like some of that peer to peer interaction,

1514
01:04:14.66 --> 01:04:17.10
but we have to create those opportunities for that.

1515
01:04:17.10 --> 01:04:18.02
And then interestingly,

1516
01:04:18.02 --> 01:04:19.26
when people start to engage in this,

1517
01:04:19.26 --> 01:04:20.66
they just not like a cognitive like,

1518
01:04:20.66 --> 01:04:22.14
oh yeah, I'll go do this thing,

1519
01:04:22.14 --> 01:04:23.06
and something will be different.

1520
01:04:23.06 --> 01:04:25.02
It's usually more like I act,

1521
01:04:25.02 --> 01:04:26.30
I have these experiences,

1522
01:04:26.30 --> 01:04:28.14
I walk through something difficult,

1523
01:04:28.14 --> 01:04:29.86
my symptoms got really activated

1524
01:04:29.86 --> 01:04:32.22
when I was gonna go try to learn how to take the bus,

1525
01:04:32.22 --> 01:04:33.26
or do the trolley,

1526
01:04:33.26 --> 01:04:35.54
but you know what, like, I had someone with me,

1527
01:04:35.54 --> 01:04:36.50
and I was able to do it,

1528
01:04:36.50 --> 01:04:37.46
and it was like okay,

1529
01:04:37.46 --> 01:04:38.90
and it didn't stay that way forever.

1530
01:04:38.90 --> 01:04:42.94
And so the kind of the insight comes a little bit later,

1531
01:04:42.94 --> 01:04:44.18
with the experience,

1532
01:04:44.18 --> 01:04:46.94
that like I can experience some discomfort,

1533
01:04:46.94 --> 01:04:49.66
or I can let my kiddo struggle a little bit,

1534
01:04:49.66 --> 01:04:50.82
or go through something,

1535
01:04:50.82 --> 01:04:52.66
and I can actually tolerate some of my fear

1536
01:04:52.66 --> 01:04:54.62
that this could be like devastating for him.

1537
01:04:54.62 --> 01:04:56.94
Because you know, oftentimes,

1538
01:04:56.94 --> 01:04:59.54
when we get to it, especially for families who have,

1539
01:04:59.54 --> 01:05:02.30
you know, we're sort of in a good place

1540
01:05:02.30 --> 01:05:04.14
if a family's coming to us at a first break,

1541
01:05:04.14 --> 01:05:06.26
because we can help them like right there,

1542
01:05:06.26 --> 01:05:09.46
but oftentimes people come to us 14 hospitals.

1543
01:05:09.46 --> 01:05:10.86
Like a last resort type thing.

1544
01:05:10.86 --> 01:05:14.38
14 hospitalizations in multiple short term treatment centers.

1545
01:05:14.38 --> 01:05:15.34
What does break look like?

1546
01:05:15.34 --> 01:05:16.58
What does that look like?

1547
01:05:16.58 --> 01:05:19.10
I mean, it looks like a break from reality.

1548
01:05:19.10 --> 01:05:20.78
It's different for each person.

1549
01:05:20.78 --> 01:05:24.42
You know, that process sometimes can appear

1550
01:05:24.42 --> 01:05:26.14
like what you see more often in like movies,

1551
01:05:26.14 --> 01:05:29.26
in such sort of bizarre, or paranoia, or I see aliens.

1552
01:05:29.26 --> 01:05:32.98
Sometimes for people with significant personality disorders,

1553
01:05:32.98 --> 01:05:34.62
and this way like delusions can be grounded

1554
01:05:34.62 --> 01:05:36.86
almost in something like that feels real.

1555
01:05:36.86 --> 01:05:38.54
Like it could be a real situation,

1556
01:05:38.54 --> 01:05:41.26
but it's in fact not when you get down to it.

1557
01:05:41.26 --> 01:05:44.38
So, but ultimately it's just a disconnect

1558
01:05:44.38 --> 01:05:46.42
from what's happening in the here and now,

1559
01:05:46.42 --> 01:05:48.94
in a lot of different ways, and it could be auditory,

1560
01:05:48.94 --> 01:05:51.50
it could be tactile in terms of a person's experience

1561
01:05:51.50 --> 01:05:53.26
of what they're feeling in their body,

1562
01:05:53.26 --> 01:05:57.38
maybe visual, just a break from reality.

1563
01:05:57.38 --> 01:05:58.54
A break from reality.

1564
01:05:58.54 --> 01:06:02.42
So, a family, they got a 18 year old kid,

1565
01:06:02.42 --> 01:06:05.10
a 20 year old kid, they're in college,

1566
01:06:05.10 --> 01:06:06.66
they're going to college, everything's fine,

1567
01:06:06.66 --> 01:06:08.46
and then all of a sudden, just give me an example.

1568
01:06:08.46 --> 01:06:09.30
What does this look like?

1569
01:06:09.30 --> 01:06:11.18
So, I mean, for example, what it might look like

1570
01:06:11.18 --> 01:06:12.74
is they're calling home and like,

1571
01:06:12.74 --> 01:06:14.90
my neighbors are, they're listening to me.

1572
01:06:14.90 --> 01:06:16.50
My neighbors are really bothering me.

1573
01:06:16.50 --> 01:06:18.06
Like they're listening through the walls.

1574
01:06:18.06 --> 01:06:19.66
I know that they're doing these things.

1575
01:06:19.66 --> 01:06:21.94
So, this is like an obvious.

1576
01:06:21.94 --> 01:06:23.30
I mean, it could be, yes,

1577
01:06:23.30 --> 01:06:24.78
or it could be as a parent you're hearing this,

1578
01:06:24.78 --> 01:06:25.78
you're like, that's really odd.

1579
01:06:25.78 --> 01:06:28.18
Like why would the neighbors be listening to them?

1580
01:06:28.18 --> 01:06:30.58
Or so sometimes this can go on for a period of time

1581
01:06:30.58 --> 01:06:32.30
where there's like some things that, you know,

1582
01:06:32.30 --> 01:06:33.58
you notice some more isolation

1583
01:06:33.58 --> 01:06:35.18
or not hanging out with friends as much,

1584
01:06:35.18 --> 01:06:38.06
or maybe there's some substance use that is sort of new.

1585
01:06:38.06 --> 01:06:41.78
And so it's not always so like in your face obvious.

1586
01:06:41.78 --> 01:06:43.98
It might not be like the neighbors are watching me.

1587
01:06:43.98 --> 01:06:46.98
It might be like, oh, I'm not doing anything this weekend.

1588
01:06:46.98 --> 01:06:49.50
Or even how many times we've had,

1589
01:06:49.50 --> 01:06:51.94
like somebody come into the treatment program

1590
01:06:51.94 --> 01:06:54.30
and the parents say, well,

1591
01:06:54.30 --> 01:06:55.46
we thought everything was great.

1592
01:06:55.46 --> 01:06:57.70
He's at college, like he seems like he's fine,

1593
01:06:57.70 --> 01:07:00.10
but we started getting calls from his friends.

1594
01:07:00.10 --> 01:07:02.30
Hey, we think something's going on.

1595
01:07:02.30 --> 01:07:03.78
It's not really coming out anymore.

1596
01:07:03.78 --> 01:07:05.82
Seems to be hanging out in his room all the time.

1597
01:07:05.82 --> 01:07:08.62
But then we call him and he says he's okay.

1598
01:07:08.62 --> 01:07:09.90
Right, so there's this like,

1599
01:07:09.90 --> 01:07:11.38
we don't really know what's going on

1600
01:07:11.38 --> 01:07:14.70
and how many times we've had, you know, family sales.

1601
01:07:14.70 --> 01:07:16.02
So we just decided to like get in the car

1602
01:07:16.02 --> 01:07:18.26
and drive up there and see what was going on for ourselves.

1603
01:07:18.26 --> 01:07:22.06
And they find their kid like disheveled,

1604
01:07:22.06 --> 01:07:23.42
maybe haven't been eating.

1605
01:07:23.42 --> 01:07:25.58
So what's going on with that kid?

1606
01:07:25.58 --> 01:07:29.30
Well, like what's an example of, okay, I get the call.

1607
01:07:29.30 --> 01:07:33.58
Hey, your son is, he's, hey, you know, Billy,

1608
01:07:33.58 --> 01:07:36.06
Billy's not come out with us for like three weeks.

1609
01:07:36.06 --> 01:07:37.02
We haven't even seen him.

1610
01:07:37.02 --> 01:07:38.34
We just want to call you and let you know,

1611
01:07:38.34 --> 01:07:40.74
like he's really been acting weird.

1612
01:07:40.74 --> 01:07:42.90
And so I call Billy and Billy says, no, I'm fine.

1613
01:07:42.90 --> 01:07:44.18
I just been studying really hard.

1614
01:07:44.18 --> 01:07:45.30
This has been a pain in school

1615
01:07:45.30 --> 01:07:47.50
and I'm really sick of Fred anyways.

1616
01:07:47.50 --> 01:07:48.58
So I'm just doing my own thing.

1617
01:07:48.58 --> 01:07:50.10
I go, okay.

1618
01:07:50.10 --> 01:07:52.78
And then, you know, I get another call.

1619
01:07:52.78 --> 01:07:53.94
It's his ex-girlfriend.

1620
01:07:53.94 --> 01:07:55.66
You know, I just, I saw him the other day.

1621
01:07:55.66 --> 01:07:57.74
He just looked totally different.

1622
01:07:57.74 --> 01:08:01.70
So I drive up there and there he is in his room.

1623
01:08:01.70 --> 01:08:03.06
His room is a mess.

1624
01:08:03.06 --> 01:08:04.82
What's going on with him?

1625
01:08:04.82 --> 01:08:05.66
What is it?

1626
01:08:05.66 --> 01:08:09.54
Is it something that he saw?

1627
01:08:09.54 --> 01:08:11.42
Is it something that got triggered?

1628
01:08:11.42 --> 01:08:14.14
Is it like, what is it?

1629
01:08:14.14 --> 01:08:14.98
Do we know?

1630
01:08:16.06 --> 01:08:17.66
Sometimes we do and sometimes we won't.

1631
01:08:17.66 --> 01:08:19.70
And this is where like the mechanic has to come in, right?

1632
01:08:19.70 --> 01:08:20.54
And figure it out.

1633
01:08:20.54 --> 01:08:21.82
Sometimes it's going to be very obvious.

1634
01:08:21.82 --> 01:08:25.98
Like a more common scenario that we've experienced is like,

1635
01:08:25.98 --> 01:08:26.82
everything was fine.

1636
01:08:26.82 --> 01:08:29.26
Star athlete, blah, blah, blah, goes to college,

1637
01:08:29.26 --> 01:08:30.74
seems to be making friends,

1638
01:08:30.74 --> 01:08:34.62
decided to start smoking weed a little bit and then boom.

1639
01:08:34.62 --> 01:08:35.46
Right?

1640
01:08:35.46 --> 01:08:36.30
It set something off.

1641
01:08:36.30 --> 01:08:39.70
Some people can smoke weed, that will not happen.

1642
01:08:40.74 --> 01:08:43.78
You know, there's some theory and hypothesis

1643
01:08:43.78 --> 01:08:48.70
that some people, you can be like predisposed

1644
01:08:48.70 --> 01:08:50.94
for schizophrenia or psychosis,

1645
01:08:50.94 --> 01:08:53.98
but it not necessarily come out,

1646
01:08:53.98 --> 01:08:55.50
but it will under certain conditions

1647
01:08:55.50 --> 01:08:57.66
and sometimes drug use is one of those.

1648
01:08:57.66 --> 01:08:59.42
So you can have somebody who's predisposed,

1649
01:08:59.42 --> 01:09:03.78
like has genetic loading and never kind of becomes

1650
01:09:03.78 --> 01:09:04.62
systematic.

1651
01:09:04.62 --> 01:09:06.78
All life and you could be one of these people.

1652
01:09:06.78 --> 01:09:11.06
And then you've got somebody who has a genetic predisposition

1653
01:09:11.06 --> 01:09:14.30
and they go to college and they start smoking a little weed

1654
01:09:14.30 --> 01:09:19.06
and it like cracks something open internally and here it comes.

1655
01:09:19.06 --> 01:09:20.98
But it could be a girlfriend breakup.

1656
01:09:20.98 --> 01:09:21.82
Totally.

1657
01:09:21.82 --> 01:09:26.90
Could be, you know, getting into the frat or whatever.

1658
01:09:26.90 --> 01:09:27.82
Disappointment.

1659
01:09:27.82 --> 01:09:29.26
Just something like that.

1660
01:09:29.26 --> 01:09:30.98
And this can, in some cases,

1661
01:09:30.98 --> 01:09:33.58
people can just kind of, they're changing.

1662
01:09:33.58 --> 01:09:35.38
And sometimes it goes away naturally.

1663
01:09:36.94 --> 01:09:38.18
Sometimes it's like, oh yeah,

1664
01:09:38.18 --> 01:09:39.70
he was bummed out for a few weeks,

1665
01:09:39.70 --> 01:09:41.42
but hey, we just saw Billy,

1666
01:09:41.42 --> 01:09:42.58
he's actually, he's come forward.

1667
01:09:42.58 --> 01:09:43.42
He's supposed to do it better.

1668
01:09:43.42 --> 01:09:44.26
Sure, yeah.

1669
01:09:44.26 --> 01:09:47.30
And it's, we can get, a person can get through it.

1670
01:09:48.30 --> 01:09:49.90
Sure, we've had folks come in,

1671
01:09:49.90 --> 01:09:52.82
like the one person I'm thinking about was,

1672
01:09:52.82 --> 01:09:54.98
I think he was in his freshman year at college.

1673
01:09:54.98 --> 01:09:59.98
Again, great student, scholarship, football.

1674
01:10:00.30 --> 01:10:02.14
I mean, just a lot of friends, great girl.

1675
01:10:02.14 --> 01:10:04.18
Like just really kind of all around.

1676
01:10:04.18 --> 01:10:05.66
And they got a call.

1677
01:10:05.66 --> 01:10:07.94
The parents got a call from the police,

1678
01:10:07.94 --> 01:10:11.66
the local police in their son's town,

1679
01:10:11.66 --> 01:10:14.34
that they found him like running around outside,

1680
01:10:14.34 --> 01:10:16.90
like half naked, like kind of crazy,

1681
01:10:16.90 --> 01:10:18.26
screaming and doing weird things.

1682
01:10:18.26 --> 01:10:20.94
And they're like, wait, did you call the right people?

1683
01:10:20.94 --> 01:10:22.58
That was not my kid.

1684
01:10:22.58 --> 01:10:25.66
Well, he had smoked, he had never done drugs,

1685
01:10:25.66 --> 01:10:27.42
or you know, maybe he had it a little bit.

1686
01:10:27.42 --> 01:10:29.30
But smoked weed and he couldn't,

1687
01:10:29.30 --> 01:10:30.94
he's like, I don't know, someone just gave it to me.

1688
01:10:30.94 --> 01:10:32.78
So who knows what was in there?

1689
01:10:32.78 --> 01:10:34.70
Well, it did something to this guy's brain.

1690
01:10:34.70 --> 01:10:36.42
I mean, it just scrambled him.

1691
01:10:36.42 --> 01:10:38.22
He did not know what way it was up or down,

1692
01:10:38.22 --> 01:10:40.02
went into the hospital.

1693
01:10:40.02 --> 01:10:42.10
They brought him to us for treatment,

1694
01:10:42.10 --> 01:10:42.94
never been in treatment.

1695
01:10:42.94 --> 01:10:45.34
I mean, had never had anything happen like this before.

1696
01:10:45.34 --> 01:10:49.18
He was back in school, I think by the next semester.

1697
01:10:49.18 --> 01:10:53.10
Like he needed, he came in, you know, we got him settled,

1698
01:10:53.10 --> 01:10:55.06
kind of walked through what happened.

1699
01:10:55.06 --> 01:10:58.26
Soon as the drugs were out of his system,

1700
01:10:58.26 --> 01:10:59.70
which didn't take a long time,

1701
01:10:59.70 --> 01:11:02.42
because he wasn't really a chronic user.

1702
01:11:02.42 --> 01:11:05.54
He cleared, like he instantly cleared in his mind.

1703
01:11:05.54 --> 01:11:09.86
So in that case, diagnosis-wise,

1704
01:11:09.86 --> 01:11:13.34
it was a substance-induced psychosis.

1705
01:11:13.34 --> 01:11:16.90
Substance-induced psychosis.

1706
01:11:16.90 --> 01:11:21.14
So soon as the substances were out of his symptoms,

1707
01:11:21.14 --> 01:11:22.86
there was no more psychosis.

1708
01:11:22.86 --> 01:11:23.70
He cleared.

1709
01:11:23.70 --> 01:11:27.46
So really, it was just helping him almost recover from,

1710
01:11:27.46 --> 01:11:29.10
I mean, that was a traumatic event.

1711
01:11:29.10 --> 01:11:31.70
And he was embarrassed and had all the shame.

1712
01:11:31.70 --> 01:11:32.58
There was like a lot of stuff.

1713
01:11:32.58 --> 01:11:35.14
He had to kind of process and recover from,

1714
01:11:35.14 --> 01:11:37.10
and then he went back to college.

1715
01:11:37.10 --> 01:11:38.50
Same school.

1716
01:11:38.50 --> 01:11:40.02
Well, an early intervention there is huge.

1717
01:11:40.02 --> 01:11:41.34
Super early.

1718
01:11:41.34 --> 01:11:43.58
Because, you know, the further away the intervention,

1719
01:11:43.58 --> 01:11:45.66
the person starts to find ways to self-sue

1720
01:11:45.66 --> 01:11:46.82
there whatever might be,

1721
01:11:46.82 --> 01:11:49.70
and it becomes much more complex at that point.

1722
01:11:49.70 --> 01:11:53.26
So if someone has one episode,

1723
01:11:53.26 --> 01:11:57.50
they're easier to help than someone that's had 28.

1724
01:11:57.50 --> 01:11:58.54
And the parents were just like,

1725
01:11:58.54 --> 01:11:59.38
oh, he'll be fine.

1726
01:11:59.38 --> 01:12:00.22
Oh, it's just Billy.

1727
01:12:00.22 --> 01:12:01.74
He's just, he acts up sometimes,

1728
01:12:01.74 --> 01:12:04.26
and then that goes on for three, four, five years.

1729
01:12:04.26 --> 01:12:06.06
He's gonna be harder to treat.

1730
01:12:06.06 --> 01:12:08.70
Or the brain stays in a constant state of psychosis

1731
01:12:08.70 --> 01:12:10.06
for a longer period of time.

1732
01:12:10.06 --> 01:12:11.98
It's hard to know what it's gonna look like

1733
01:12:11.98 --> 01:12:13.78
when they come out of that, right?

1734
01:12:13.78 --> 01:12:17.70
Explain what psychosis actually means.

1735
01:12:18.70 --> 01:12:19.62
You wanna go?

1736
01:12:19.62 --> 01:12:21.50
Yeah, well, it's, well, you had said it earlier.

1737
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:23.66
It's a break in reality.

1738
01:12:23.66 --> 01:12:28.66
Psychosis typically is defined as a break

1739
01:12:28.90 --> 01:12:30.90
in contact with reality.

1740
01:12:30.90 --> 01:12:32.82
And what's interesting though about psychosis,

1741
01:12:32.82 --> 01:12:36.94
and I say this in the presentation and in the book,

1742
01:12:36.94 --> 01:12:40.22
is people can be psychotic,

1743
01:12:40.22 --> 01:12:42.58
people can be psychotic, have a psychotic episode,

1744
01:12:42.58 --> 01:12:44.58
and it not be related to a mental illness.

1745
01:12:44.58 --> 01:12:45.42
Right.

1746
01:12:45.42 --> 01:12:46.90
What would that look like?

1747
01:12:48.62 --> 01:12:50.10
Anesthesia.

1748
01:12:50.10 --> 01:12:51.22
Like under anesthesia,

1749
01:12:51.22 --> 01:12:54.30
people have reported hallucinating, malnourishment

1750
01:12:54.30 --> 01:12:56.90
and dehydration, somebody can hallucinate,

1751
01:12:56.90 --> 01:12:59.38
hear voices, have delusions.

1752
01:12:59.38 --> 01:13:00.46
Sleep deprivation.

1753
01:13:00.46 --> 01:13:03.38
Sleep deprivation 100%.

1754
01:13:03.38 --> 01:13:04.22
So there are a lot.

1755
01:13:04.22 --> 01:13:06.10
In CO training, they keep you awake for a long time.

1756
01:13:06.10 --> 01:13:07.50
And you know, we wouldn't be surprised

1757
01:13:07.50 --> 01:13:09.06
if you are seeing some things

1758
01:13:09.06 --> 01:13:10.50
that maybe are not actually there.

1759
01:13:10.50 --> 01:13:12.30
Yeah, I was out on the boat in the middle of the ocean,

1760
01:13:12.30 --> 01:13:15.06
and I thought I saw like traffic lights,

1761
01:13:15.06 --> 01:13:17.14
and I was like, hey, we gotta stop.

1762
01:13:17.14 --> 01:13:18.98
And I actually knew that I was hallucinating.

1763
01:13:18.98 --> 01:13:20.02
I was like, that can't be real,

1764
01:13:20.02 --> 01:13:22.18
because I'm in the ocean, but that definitely is a stoplight.

1765
01:13:22.18 --> 01:13:23.50
And I think we should stop,

1766
01:13:23.50 --> 01:13:25.86
but that doesn't make any sense.

1767
01:13:25.86 --> 01:13:26.86
Head injury.

1768
01:13:28.94 --> 01:13:33.34
So psychotic event is when you're disconnected

1769
01:13:33.34 --> 01:13:34.58
from reality in a big way.

1770
01:13:34.58 --> 01:13:37.26
Yeah, like a break and kind of the contact in reality.

1771
01:13:37.26 --> 01:13:39.66
Like seeing something that isn't there,

1772
01:13:39.66 --> 01:13:42.66
feeling, hearing something, or delusion, right?

1773
01:13:42.66 --> 01:13:45.78
Like a belief that somebody's following me,

1774
01:13:45.78 --> 01:13:49.54
somebody's watching me, somebody's out to get me.

1775
01:13:49.54 --> 01:13:53.22
I was telling one of my friends the other day

1776
01:13:53.22 --> 01:13:55.74
in supervision that one of my very first patients

1777
01:13:55.74 --> 01:13:58.82
who had schizophrenia, and he was pretty severe,

1778
01:13:58.82 --> 01:14:01.30
had a belief that he was like,

1779
01:14:01.30 --> 01:14:04.70
every once in a while he was reincarnated as somebody else.

1780
01:14:04.70 --> 01:14:08.10
So, but like, you know, sometimes he would talk about that,

1781
01:14:08.10 --> 01:14:10.74
like funny, he would be like, oh my God,

1782
01:14:10.74 --> 01:14:12.42
Karlyn, remember last week when I told you

1783
01:14:12.42 --> 01:14:14.90
I thought I was Ram Dass?

1784
01:14:14.90 --> 01:14:16.82
I'm like, mm-hmm, I do remember that.

1785
01:14:16.82 --> 01:14:18.78
He's like, wow, that was really weird, oh my God.

1786
01:14:18.78 --> 01:14:19.90
Oh, so he kind of knew it.

1787
01:14:19.90 --> 01:14:21.90
And then he wouldn't, like then sometimes he wouldn't.

1788
01:14:21.90 --> 01:14:26.06
He'd be like so in it and very like fixed

1789
01:14:26.06 --> 01:14:30.14
that you really couldn't kind of talk him out of it,

1790
01:14:30.14 --> 01:14:30.98
so to speak.

1791
01:14:30.98 --> 01:14:33.26
So here I'm gonna open up just the biggest can of worms.

1792
01:14:33.26 --> 01:14:36.34
What the hell happens when I'm on the internet

1793
01:14:36.34 --> 01:14:38.62
and social media and I'm starting to think

1794
01:14:38.62 --> 01:14:41.50
that I'm a little bit conspiratorial

1795
01:14:41.50 --> 01:14:45.42
and I start reading various websites

1796
01:14:45.42 --> 01:14:49.74
that are just totally Reddit,

1797
01:14:49.74 --> 01:14:52.38
which is like a website that has a bunch of different

1798
01:14:52.38 --> 01:14:54.70
random things, I mean, I guess they all do.

1799
01:14:54.70 --> 01:14:57.98
I mean, you can go down, you can do any Reddit, YouTube,

1800
01:14:57.98 --> 01:14:59.94
any one of these things, you can go watch something

1801
01:14:59.94 --> 01:15:02.46
on YouTube that if you have a little bit of an indication

1802
01:15:02.46 --> 01:15:04.02
that the world might be flat,

1803
01:15:04.02 --> 01:15:06.22
you guys heard of Flat Earthers?

1804
01:15:06.22 --> 01:15:07.06
Yeah, that.

1805
01:15:07.06 --> 01:15:07.90
Yep, they're out there.

1806
01:15:07.90 --> 01:15:11.98
Yeah, the Earth is flat and there's videos upon videos

1807
01:15:11.98 --> 01:15:14.78
upon threads upon threads of the Earth is flat.

1808
01:15:14.78 --> 01:15:17.98
So if you have a little bit of paranoia about something,

1809
01:15:18.94 --> 01:15:20.38
that can't be good for you.

1810
01:15:20.38 --> 01:15:22.06
You have to be really mindful of that.

1811
01:15:22.06 --> 01:15:25.30
The internet is a dangerous place.

1812
01:15:25.30 --> 01:15:27.70
Like WebMD, self-diagnosing.

1813
01:15:27.70 --> 01:15:28.54
Oh yeah.

1814
01:15:32.62 --> 01:15:33.94
How bad is that?

1815
01:15:33.94 --> 01:15:37.90
Like, I mean, you talk about, oh, somebody can smoke weed.

1816
01:15:37.90 --> 01:15:39.62
How bad is it if I think, you know what,

1817
01:15:39.62 --> 01:15:42.26
I really think that there's a world order

1818
01:15:42.26 --> 01:15:43.90
that's trying to keep me down?

1819
01:15:43.90 --> 01:15:45.26
Well, I mean, I think it depends on the person

1820
01:15:45.26 --> 01:15:47.50
and their ability to sort of like self-moderate

1821
01:15:47.50 --> 01:15:49.10
their exposure to stuff like that.

1822
01:15:49.10 --> 01:15:51.50
Cause if you're in a healthier place

1823
01:15:51.50 --> 01:15:53.02
and you can moderate your exposure to that

1824
01:15:53.02 --> 01:15:55.18
and you realize, gosh, I just spent two hours

1825
01:15:55.18 --> 01:15:56.66
scrolling through this, super unhealthy,

1826
01:15:56.66 --> 01:15:58.90
I'm not feeling good and I can set some sort of boundaries

1827
01:15:58.90 --> 01:16:01.94
for myself around that, then like, what's, it's positive.

1828
01:16:01.94 --> 01:16:03.18
You know, I think we all have the tendency

1829
01:16:03.18 --> 01:16:05.90
towards indulgence in some ways.

1830
01:16:05.90 --> 01:16:07.34
But for someone who struggles with that

1831
01:16:07.34 --> 01:16:08.86
or who's coming to us and like every time

1832
01:16:08.86 --> 01:16:10.74
they turn on the news, there's a significant amount

1833
01:16:10.74 --> 01:16:12.86
of paranoia for them and that causes them to act

1834
01:16:12.86 --> 01:16:14.78
in response to those delusions or thoughts

1835
01:16:14.78 --> 01:16:17.02
in a way that's like harmful to them or others.

1836
01:16:17.02 --> 01:16:19.18
Well, then we help moderate some of that.

1837
01:16:19.18 --> 01:16:20.46
You know, a lot of the treatment that we do

1838
01:16:20.46 --> 01:16:22.46
and why it takes so much time is creating

1839
01:16:22.46 --> 01:16:23.98
some scaffolding around things like that.

1840
01:16:23.98 --> 01:16:25.78
So the people can develop that insight

1841
01:16:25.78 --> 01:16:27.50
if it's not readily available to them

1842
01:16:27.50 --> 01:16:29.34
because with something like schizophrenia,

1843
01:16:29.34 --> 01:16:30.38
I mean, it's a thought disorder.

1844
01:16:30.38 --> 01:16:32.06
It's impacting your cognition,

1845
01:16:32.06 --> 01:16:33.82
your ability to think in a lot of ways.

1846
01:16:33.82 --> 01:16:36.74
And so if someone is not able to self-regulate

1847
01:16:36.74 --> 01:16:39.22
in that way, we help create some scaffolding for them.

1848
01:16:39.22 --> 01:16:41.98
So like maybe we're not watching the news at five tonight

1849
01:16:41.98 --> 01:16:43.50
because that's not gonna end up good

1850
01:16:43.50 --> 01:16:45.78
because every time you do, you end up out on the streets

1851
01:16:45.78 --> 01:16:47.98
or whatever it might be in an embarrassing state.

1852
01:16:47.98 --> 01:16:49.38
You just don't want me to watch the news

1853
01:16:49.38 --> 01:16:50.50
because you don't want to know what's going on

1854
01:16:50.50 --> 01:16:52.18
because you're part of a conspiracy.

1855
01:16:52.18 --> 01:16:55.74
Well, a lot of times, which is why it's so important

1856
01:16:55.74 --> 01:16:59.14
to build a sense of rapport and safety with someone,

1857
01:16:59.14 --> 01:17:00.66
to be consistent in what you're doing

1858
01:17:00.66 --> 01:17:02.18
and have an environment that's consistent

1859
01:17:02.18 --> 01:17:03.74
so that people feel safe enough

1860
01:17:03.74 --> 01:17:04.82
to allow you to support them.

1861
01:17:04.82 --> 01:17:09.02
And they will in a lot of ways with time.

1862
01:17:09.02 --> 01:17:11.86
But the work that we do is not a quick fix.

1863
01:17:11.86 --> 01:17:15.22
People spend a long period of time with us

1864
01:17:16.46 --> 01:17:19.62
and so that we can develop enough safety

1865
01:17:19.62 --> 01:17:21.86
where they will buy into trying some of the things

1866
01:17:21.86 --> 01:17:26.18
that we're requesting or suggesting might be helpful for them.

1867
01:17:26.18 --> 01:17:28.38
And so that then they can develop some of their own insight.

1868
01:17:28.38 --> 01:17:31.66
Like, oh, wow, I haven't had this much paranoia

1869
01:17:31.66 --> 01:17:34.62
or I haven't been this kind of undone for a period of time

1870
01:17:34.62 --> 01:17:37.30
and I also haven't watched the news for this period of time.

1871
01:17:37.30 --> 01:17:39.06
Like maybe that is helpful for me.

1872
01:17:39.06 --> 01:17:41.14
And then usually when they come to the latter part

1873
01:17:41.14 --> 01:17:43.78
of their time or their journey where they're more

1874
01:17:43.78 --> 01:17:45.78
in like an outpatient type setting,

1875
01:17:45.78 --> 01:17:47.58
they can reflect back some of those things.

1876
01:17:47.58 --> 01:17:49.46
Like I didn't like the structure that you put me on

1877
01:17:49.46 --> 01:17:52.06
or I didn't like this particular thing,

1878
01:17:52.06 --> 01:17:55.18
but I realize now why that was so helpful for me.

1879
01:17:55.18 --> 01:18:00.18
Do people have to be open to wanting to change

1880
01:18:00.18 --> 01:18:02.10
in order to change?

1881
01:18:02.10 --> 01:18:04.42
And if you have someone that's just like,

1882
01:18:04.42 --> 01:18:06.98
the parent put them in there, the 23 year old kid,

1883
01:18:06.98 --> 01:18:09.94
hey, look, you're going in here, you're gonna get fixed.

1884
01:18:09.94 --> 01:18:11.30
That's like all of our people.

1885
01:18:11.30 --> 01:18:15.22
From our perspective is especially when you're working

1886
01:18:15.22 --> 01:18:17.78
with something like a thought disorder like schizophrenia,

1887
01:18:17.78 --> 01:18:21.10
a systemic containment is incredibly helpful.

1888
01:18:21.10 --> 01:18:22.58
Systemic containment?

1889
01:18:22.58 --> 01:18:25.46
Meaning that the family is helping to support

1890
01:18:25.46 --> 01:18:28.58
some sort of boundaries around the options

1891
01:18:28.58 --> 01:18:30.50
that the child has in a lot of ways.

1892
01:18:30.50 --> 01:18:31.90
Because sometimes people will come to us

1893
01:18:31.90 --> 01:18:33.94
and their kiddo has schizophrenia,

1894
01:18:33.94 --> 01:18:35.10
that they don't want to come to treatment,

1895
01:18:35.10 --> 01:18:36.42
they don't want to do these things,

1896
01:18:36.42 --> 01:18:38.86
they don't want to do some things that are gonna help them.

1897
01:18:38.86 --> 01:18:39.78
Wait, the kid doesn't?

1898
01:18:39.78 --> 01:18:40.82
The kid doesn't.

1899
01:18:40.82 --> 01:18:42.82
But yet, and the family's like,

1900
01:18:42.82 --> 01:18:44.58
I don't know what to do, he doesn't want to come.

1901
01:18:44.58 --> 01:18:47.38
So like, well, how does he have this car?

1902
01:18:47.38 --> 01:18:48.78
How does he have this apartment?

1903
01:18:48.78 --> 01:18:50.22
He's like not able to work.

1904
01:18:50.22 --> 01:18:52.38
And so we help the family really create some structures

1905
01:18:52.38 --> 01:18:55.58
around like sort of some boundaries in a way of like,

1906
01:18:55.58 --> 01:18:57.42
I'm here to support you and I'm gonna help you

1907
01:18:57.42 --> 01:18:59.66
on this journey within the context of this realm

1908
01:18:59.66 --> 01:19:00.50
that's gonna be helpful for you.

1909
01:19:00.50 --> 01:19:01.42
But you've gotta do your part type of thing.

1910
01:19:01.42 --> 01:19:03.78
Exactly, so a lot of times when folks come,

1911
01:19:03.78 --> 01:19:05.74
they aren't necessarily happy to be there,

1912
01:19:05.74 --> 01:19:07.30
but they just don't have a lot of options.

1913
01:19:07.30 --> 01:19:09.18
And we really work with family, extended family,

1914
01:19:09.18 --> 01:19:10.46
grandparents, whatnot to be like,

1915
01:19:10.46 --> 01:19:13.38
don't send that $500 check because if you do,

1916
01:19:13.38 --> 01:19:15.26
I know you feel bad and he doesn't have any money,

1917
01:19:15.26 --> 01:19:17.62
he's probably gonna be out on the streets drinking

1918
01:19:17.62 --> 01:19:18.78
or whatever it might be.

1919
01:19:18.78 --> 01:19:20.90
And so we work with as many people as we can

1920
01:19:20.90 --> 01:19:23.14
to create a nice safe container in some ways,

1921
01:19:23.14 --> 01:19:25.10
which is the treatment environment.

1922
01:19:25.10 --> 01:19:27.58
Because with what we do, it's not a locked setting.

1923
01:19:27.58 --> 01:19:30.82
It's sort of the least restrictive type of environment

1924
01:19:30.82 --> 01:19:33.58
in a residential setting, but it requires a ton of containment

1925
01:19:33.58 --> 01:19:35.74
and support from every member of like the community

1926
01:19:35.74 --> 01:19:38.26
that's working there in the family to make sure that

1927
01:19:38.26 --> 01:19:40.58
there's a path and maybe there's a couple options

1928
01:19:40.58 --> 01:19:42.50
to the path, but it's really clear and they're tight

1929
01:19:42.50 --> 01:19:46.42
and contained so that the person can actually have

1930
01:19:46.42 --> 01:19:48.66
some experiences and we can calm down some of the things

1931
01:19:48.66 --> 01:19:51.06
that are happening in these symptoms so that they can begin

1932
01:19:51.06 --> 01:19:53.30
to develop some of their own insight or understanding

1933
01:19:53.30 --> 01:19:54.14
as to why.

1934
01:19:54.14 --> 01:19:57.10
And sometimes, the hardest part about the work that we do

1935
01:19:57.10 --> 01:19:58.78
is that you can want to help someone,

1936
01:19:58.78 --> 01:20:02.22
you can want to save them, you can want to,

1937
01:20:02.22 --> 01:20:05.34
and they might not want that and it might not be the choice

1938
01:20:05.34 --> 01:20:09.02
that they have for themselves and we've had to walk through

1939
01:20:09.02 --> 01:20:11.02
losses in that way as well.

1940
01:20:11.02 --> 01:20:14.98
So I do think there is a component of that person wanting

1941
01:20:14.98 --> 01:20:17.66
some of that and even if somebody on the surface

1942
01:20:17.66 --> 01:20:20.06
doesn't want it, families and the people around them

1943
01:20:20.06 --> 01:20:21.86
can do a lot to create an environment for them

1944
01:20:21.86 --> 01:20:24.42
where they can grow in that desire for themselves.

1945
01:20:25.30 --> 01:20:27.14
And sometimes people don't.

1946
01:20:29.06 --> 01:20:32.46
So this is like a tough love scenario in some way.

1947
01:20:33.38 --> 01:20:34.22
Am I right?

1948
01:20:34.22 --> 01:20:35.74
It's like a tough love scenario.

1949
01:20:35.74 --> 01:20:40.74
So sometimes, I've got friends and they might be having

1950
01:20:41.34 --> 01:20:46.34
a hard time with whatever, maybe they're drinking

1951
01:20:46.46 --> 01:20:49.78
or they're not doing what they should be doing.

1952
01:20:49.78 --> 01:20:54.78
And I think most of the time what they need is,

1953
01:20:55.54 --> 01:20:56.50
bro, what are you doing?

1954
01:20:56.50 --> 01:20:58.26
You're being an idiot, stop doing that.

1955
01:20:58.26 --> 01:21:00.50
And they go, yeah, man, you know what, I'm being an idiot.

1956
01:21:00.50 --> 01:21:01.82
I need to stop doing that.

1957
01:21:01.82 --> 01:21:03.58
It seems like that's a vast majority of the time

1958
01:21:03.58 --> 01:21:04.98
of what people need.

1959
01:21:04.98 --> 01:21:08.38
What scares me is, you know, if I say,

1960
01:21:08.38 --> 01:21:09.22
what are you doing?

1961
01:21:09.22 --> 01:21:10.22
You're being an idiot.

1962
01:21:11.34 --> 01:21:13.82
And they really do have like some significant issue

1963
01:21:13.82 --> 01:21:15.02
that they don't have any control over.

1964
01:21:15.02 --> 01:21:15.86
They can't help.

1965
01:21:15.86 --> 01:21:19.30
And all of a sudden I was just the worst friend ever

1966
01:21:19.30 --> 01:21:21.38
by saying, dude, you're being a wimp,

1967
01:21:21.38 --> 01:21:23.10
just get over it and move forward.

1968
01:21:23.10 --> 01:21:27.34
And they think, oh, Jocko's saying I'm a wimp.

1969
01:21:27.34 --> 01:21:28.70
That means I really am a wimp.

1970
01:21:28.70 --> 01:21:30.62
That means I'm not good enough.

1971
01:21:30.62 --> 01:21:32.66
And they go down and I'm worried

1972
01:21:32.66 --> 01:21:36.06
that they would go down a spiral as opposed to,

1973
01:21:36.06 --> 01:21:37.98
hey man, stop acting like that.

1974
01:21:37.98 --> 01:21:40.74
Hey, quit blaming this incident

1975
01:21:40.74 --> 01:21:41.74
on the way you're acting now.

1976
01:21:41.74 --> 01:21:44.26
You know, you need to show up to work on time.

1977
01:21:44.26 --> 01:21:45.10
You need to get a job.

1978
01:21:45.10 --> 01:21:46.90
You need to stop drinking.

1979
01:21:46.90 --> 01:21:50.30
Sometimes like that's, and I think actually most of the time

1980
01:21:50.30 --> 01:21:52.78
people just need like, bro, what are you doing?

1981
01:21:52.78 --> 01:21:55.70
And I'm talking bro because these are my friends

1982
01:21:55.70 --> 01:21:57.26
that are dudes.

1983
01:21:57.26 --> 01:22:00.54
Even though oddly enough, my daughters call each other bro.

1984
01:22:00.54 --> 01:22:04.58
And they call all their friends bro that are all females.

1985
01:22:04.58 --> 01:22:05.42
They got it down.

1986
01:22:05.42 --> 01:22:10.42
Yeah, so, but is there some way to discern

1987
01:22:11.02 --> 01:22:13.42
whether someone's crossed the line into,

1988
01:22:13.42 --> 01:22:16.10
okay, listen, tough love isn't gonna help this individual

1989
01:22:16.10 --> 01:22:18.86
anymore and I need to get them some real help?

1990
01:22:18.86 --> 01:22:20.22
Cause that's the scary thing.

1991
01:22:21.50 --> 01:22:23.82
I'll experience that with a person that I know

1992
01:22:23.82 --> 01:22:26.46
and acquaintance that I have, a friend that I have that,

1993
01:22:26.46 --> 01:22:29.54
oh, he's not looking good, right?

1994
01:22:29.54 --> 01:22:32.58
Stop working out, which to me is a big indicator of,

1995
01:22:32.58 --> 01:22:33.62
oh, stop working out.

1996
01:22:33.62 --> 01:22:35.50
Doesn't, you know, not to really eat like crap

1997
01:22:35.50 --> 01:22:38.34
and seems to be drinking a lot.

1998
01:22:38.34 --> 01:22:42.66
And what I wanna say and what I have said to do guys is,

1999
01:22:42.66 --> 01:22:43.50
bro, what are you doing?

2000
01:22:43.50 --> 01:22:45.18
Why are you not working out?

2001
01:22:45.18 --> 01:22:46.02
You're getting fat.

2002
01:22:46.02 --> 01:22:46.84
What are you doing?

2003
01:22:46.84 --> 01:22:48.14
Like, how much are you drinking?

2004
01:22:48.14 --> 01:22:49.54
Are you drinking every night?

2005
01:22:49.54 --> 01:22:50.90
What's wrong with you?

2006
01:22:50.90 --> 01:22:51.74
Get back on the path.

2007
01:22:51.74 --> 01:22:52.70
Like stop.

2008
01:22:52.70 --> 01:22:55.70
And oftentimes they're like, yeah, but I've been so lazy.

2009
01:22:55.70 --> 01:22:57.30
I need to, I've been thinking about this thing,

2010
01:22:57.30 --> 01:22:59.22
but you're right, I need to keep going.

2011
01:22:59.22 --> 01:23:01.50
But then I get the feeling sometimes is like,

2012
01:23:01.50 --> 01:23:03.62
it's deeper and worse.

2013
01:23:04.86 --> 01:23:06.14
Is there any way to discern?

2014
01:23:06.14 --> 01:23:08.10
Is there any warning signs to look out for

2015
01:23:08.10 --> 01:23:10.22
between these two individuals,

2016
01:23:10.22 --> 01:23:13.02
one of whom needs this good kick in the ass

2017
01:23:13.02 --> 01:23:15.46
that's gonna get them moving in the right direction?

2018
01:23:15.46 --> 01:23:17.14
And the other one, I kick them in the ass,

2019
01:23:17.14 --> 01:23:18.34
they're gonna fall down the stairs

2020
01:23:18.34 --> 01:23:19.50
and it's gonna hurt them.

2021
01:23:20.78 --> 01:23:22.82
I mean, that's a tough question.

2022
01:23:22.82 --> 01:23:24.54
I mean, discernment is important

2023
01:23:24.54 --> 01:23:25.78
in knowing people's history and such,

2024
01:23:25.78 --> 01:23:26.82
especially in the work we do.

2025
01:23:26.82 --> 01:23:27.90
I think it's different, you know,

2026
01:23:27.90 --> 01:23:29.66
when you're looking from a clinical perspective,

2027
01:23:29.66 --> 01:23:30.98
but discernment is huge.

2028
01:23:30.98 --> 01:23:33.18
And at the same time, I think one of the hardest things

2029
01:23:33.18 --> 01:23:34.70
in loving or caring about somebody

2030
01:23:34.70 --> 01:23:35.90
who's struggling with something is that

2031
01:23:35.90 --> 01:23:37.42
we don't necessarily have control

2032
01:23:37.42 --> 01:23:39.86
over how they respond to what we try to give them.

2033
01:23:39.86 --> 01:23:41.70
And so, you know, coming from a place of,

2034
01:23:41.70 --> 01:23:44.42
if my approach is tough love

2035
01:23:44.42 --> 01:23:45.78
in terms of what you're describing

2036
01:23:45.78 --> 01:23:49.14
and like what you're being honest and true to yourself,

2037
01:23:49.14 --> 01:23:50.90
and can also add that other part of like,

2038
01:23:50.90 --> 01:23:52.98
there's a part of me that's sort of fearful

2039
01:23:52.98 --> 01:23:54.22
that if I have tough love on you,

2040
01:23:54.22 --> 01:23:56.54
that's like, this is gonna go kind of sideways for you.

2041
01:23:56.54 --> 01:23:57.54
Does that feel true for you?

2042
01:23:57.54 --> 01:23:59.38
And just sort of being direct and honest with people.

2043
01:23:59.38 --> 01:24:01.26
I mean, I think people can feel congruency.

2044
01:24:01.26 --> 01:24:02.46
They can feel care.

2045
01:24:02.46 --> 01:24:06.34
And tough love, if it's coming from a place that's like love,

2046
01:24:06.34 --> 01:24:09.42
it's felt very differently than something that's critical

2047
01:24:09.42 --> 01:24:11.26
or mean or suggests like,

2048
01:24:11.26 --> 01:24:12.82
I'm gonna cut you off from my life

2049
01:24:12.82 --> 01:24:14.70
if you don't do this thing.

2050
01:24:14.70 --> 01:24:15.90
That's very different.

2051
01:24:15.90 --> 01:24:17.22
So when we talk about tough love,

2052
01:24:17.22 --> 01:24:18.74
and oftentimes it is working families,

2053
01:24:18.74 --> 01:24:19.86
you're like, this isn't mean.

2054
01:24:19.86 --> 01:24:21.90
This is actually the most loving thing you could do

2055
01:24:21.90 --> 01:24:24.26
for this person because to say nothing

2056
01:24:24.26 --> 01:24:26.10
or to let them continue on in a way

2057
01:24:26.10 --> 01:24:27.70
where their life is just deteriorating,

2058
01:24:27.70 --> 01:24:30.10
well, that would be horrible, right?

2059
01:24:30.10 --> 01:24:33.90
So like to do nothing would be very harmful.

2060
01:24:33.90 --> 01:24:35.78
And so I don't think, I mean,

2061
01:24:35.78 --> 01:24:38.78
this is the hardest thing about severe mental illness

2062
01:24:38.78 --> 01:24:40.62
is that we can try a lot, we can say a lot,

2063
01:24:40.62 --> 01:24:42.54
we can do things we don't necessarily have control

2064
01:24:42.54 --> 01:24:44.22
over what somebody's gonna do with the feedback

2065
01:24:44.22 --> 01:24:45.26
that we give them.

2066
01:24:46.22 --> 01:24:47.70
And there's risk too, right?

2067
01:24:47.70 --> 01:24:49.10
There's definitely risk involved

2068
01:24:49.10 --> 01:24:51.30
in doing some of those things.

2069
01:24:51.30 --> 01:24:55.18
And it doesn't always have a positive outcome

2070
01:24:55.18 --> 01:24:57.78
to set boundaries and things like that.

2071
01:24:57.78 --> 01:25:01.02
And at the same time, I think being congruent

2072
01:25:01.02 --> 01:25:03.58
is like most important.

2073
01:25:03.58 --> 01:25:06.14
And I think what you said earlier about rapport,

2074
01:25:06.14 --> 01:25:07.78
like I think about some of the clients

2075
01:25:07.78 --> 01:25:09.06
I've seen for the longest,

2076
01:25:09.06 --> 01:25:10.98
I mean, I have relationships with these,

2077
01:25:10.98 --> 01:25:12.94
I know these guys, you know these guys.

2078
01:25:12.94 --> 01:25:15.66
Like I can tell, like and I can,

2079
01:25:15.66 --> 01:25:17.58
because I have rapport, I always joke,

2080
01:25:17.58 --> 01:25:19.26
like you've heard me say this in supervision,

2081
01:25:19.26 --> 01:25:21.22
like I'm sometimes surprised myself

2082
01:25:21.22 --> 01:25:23.74
with how much I can get away with saying.

2083
01:25:23.74 --> 01:25:24.82
Because I have enough rapport

2084
01:25:24.82 --> 01:25:26.70
where I know the person's gonna be able to handle it.

2085
01:25:26.70 --> 01:25:28.14
Even if it's something like,

2086
01:25:28.14 --> 01:25:29.94
I have a client this literally just happened.

2087
01:25:29.94 --> 01:25:34.06
I said, you sound like a crazy person right now.

2088
01:25:34.06 --> 01:25:35.22
And she's like, I know, don't I?

2089
01:25:35.22 --> 01:25:36.98
I said, you kinda do.

2090
01:25:36.98 --> 01:25:38.54
Now I wouldn't say that to everybody

2091
01:25:38.54 --> 01:25:40.42
and if I didn't have that kind of relationship

2092
01:25:40.42 --> 01:25:41.94
with a different client, I'm not gonna say that.

2093
01:25:41.94 --> 01:25:45.26
That could be construed as like rude and very not PC, right?

2094
01:25:45.26 --> 01:25:46.98
But with her, I can say it like,

2095
01:25:46.98 --> 01:25:48.18
you're doing that thing right now

2096
01:25:48.18 --> 01:25:49.18
where you just, you kinda sound

2097
01:25:49.18 --> 01:25:50.26
and look like a crazy person.

2098
01:25:50.26 --> 01:25:51.46
Can you pull it together?

2099
01:25:51.46 --> 01:25:54.70
And she'll be like, okay, you know, we move on.

2100
01:25:54.70 --> 01:25:57.34
But if I were to say that to her, say one afternoon

2101
01:25:57.34 --> 01:25:59.54
and she can't pull it together,

2102
01:25:59.54 --> 01:26:02.02
or she, how dare you say that to me?

2103
01:26:02.02 --> 01:26:04.70
Or she reacts in a way that's different

2104
01:26:04.70 --> 01:26:07.02
than my experience of her typically.

2105
01:26:07.02 --> 01:26:09.14
You know, that's gonna be my discerning clue of like,

2106
01:26:09.14 --> 01:26:11.02
okay, this might be something a little bit more

2107
01:26:11.02 --> 01:26:14.18
than she's just having a moment.

2108
01:26:14.18 --> 01:26:16.94
Like I know her enough or I know him enough

2109
01:26:16.94 --> 01:26:20.02
to know like, oh, I kinda pulled the like, come on,

2110
01:26:20.02 --> 01:26:21.06
get your shit together.

2111
01:26:21.06 --> 01:26:24.34
I know you can do this and it works.

2112
01:26:24.34 --> 01:26:27.02
And the times when it seems to not really be working,

2113
01:26:27.02 --> 01:26:28.50
then it's just my clue that, okay,

2114
01:26:28.50 --> 01:26:30.78
there maybe is something a little bit more happening here.

2115
01:26:30.78 --> 01:26:33.46
So I'm just gonna like change my approach a little bit,

2116
01:26:33.46 --> 01:26:36.18
slow it down and maybe ask more questions instead of say,

2117
01:26:36.18 --> 01:26:38.18
hey, come on, get it together and move on.

2118
01:26:38.18 --> 01:26:40.94
It might be like, so what's happening?

2119
01:26:40.94 --> 01:26:42.90
Because you seem different to me today

2120
01:26:42.90 --> 01:26:44.58
than you did last week, what's going on?

2121
01:26:44.58 --> 01:26:49.30
I might ask a little bit more to see if more comes out.

2122
01:26:49.30 --> 01:26:51.82
But I think there's a place for both.

2123
01:26:51.82 --> 01:26:54.66
People really, especially people

2124
01:26:54.66 --> 01:26:56.62
who are very disorganized internally,

2125
01:26:56.62 --> 01:26:58.54
which you will see more with psychosis,

2126
01:26:58.54 --> 01:27:01.98
or just in a funk, in their depression,

2127
01:27:01.98 --> 01:27:04.42
in their grief, whatever, whatever.

2128
01:27:05.30 --> 01:27:09.02
They need actually like the scaffolding on the outside.

2129
01:27:09.02 --> 01:27:10.30
Somebody to say, okay, you know what?

2130
01:27:10.30 --> 01:27:13.42
You need to get up, go take a shower,

2131
01:27:13.42 --> 01:27:16.50
brush your teeth, meet me in the kitchen in 15 minutes.

2132
01:27:16.50 --> 01:27:19.82
Like that kind of direction actually helps gel

2133
01:27:19.82 --> 01:27:22.14
some of the looseness that's happening internally

2134
01:27:22.14 --> 01:27:23.78
when someone's really struggling.

2135
01:27:23.78 --> 01:27:25.18
And then there's gonna be times hopefully

2136
01:27:25.18 --> 01:27:26.50
when that's not needed,

2137
01:27:26.50 --> 01:27:28.38
that they can do that for themselves.

2138
01:27:29.42 --> 01:27:33.26
From, this is sort of, I guess, parallel

2139
01:27:33.26 --> 01:27:35.54
or at least adjacent to the social media stuff

2140
01:27:35.54 --> 01:27:36.78
we were talking about this,

2141
01:27:36.78 --> 01:27:40.58
the idea that we did a podcast on social contagions, right?

2142
01:27:40.58 --> 01:27:43.62
Which is, and I think one of the best examples

2143
01:27:43.62 --> 01:27:45.78
that I read about was bulimia.

2144
01:27:45.78 --> 01:27:49.18
And when the first reported case of bulimia

2145
01:27:49.18 --> 01:27:51.66
was in 1979 or something like this,

2146
01:27:51.66 --> 01:27:56.54
I forget the dates, but this guy did an article

2147
01:27:56.54 --> 01:27:59.82
about these girls who were making themselves sick.

2148
01:27:59.82 --> 01:28:01.78
And there was three or four girls

2149
01:28:01.78 --> 01:28:03.18
that he did this report on.

2150
01:28:03.18 --> 01:28:07.46
And after that, the number of cases

2151
01:28:07.46 --> 01:28:09.50
went completely through the roof.

2152
01:28:10.38 --> 01:28:13.02
Same thing with cutting.

2153
01:28:13.02 --> 01:28:16.26
Like this happens with young females a lot.

2154
01:28:16.26 --> 01:28:17.38
They cut themselves,

2155
01:28:17.38 --> 01:28:20.74
but it'll spread through a community,

2156
01:28:20.74 --> 01:28:22.34
through a friendship group of girls.

2157
01:28:22.34 --> 01:28:24.50
Happens with suicide.

2158
01:28:24.50 --> 01:28:25.78
You know, there's this thing where,

2159
01:28:25.78 --> 01:28:27.54
and this always scares me because,

2160
01:28:27.54 --> 01:28:29.18
you know, doing a podcast like what we're doing today

2161
01:28:29.18 --> 01:28:31.90
and a lot of people are gonna listen to this.

2162
01:28:31.90 --> 01:28:35.18
When they put up anti-suicide

2163
01:28:35.18 --> 01:28:38.58
or suicide help hotline numbers in a community,

2164
01:28:38.58 --> 01:28:41.14
oftentimes the suicide rate increases

2165
01:28:41.14 --> 01:28:43.58
because now it's putting it in their mind.

2166
01:28:43.58 --> 01:28:44.74
How much do you,

2167
01:28:44.74 --> 01:28:47.66
how much have you all seen of that in the last,

2168
01:28:47.66 --> 01:28:48.86
you know, 10 years?

2169
01:28:48.86 --> 01:28:50.50
And I guess it's maybe even less than that,

2170
01:28:50.50 --> 01:28:54.90
seven years of where people are so connected

2171
01:28:54.90 --> 01:28:57.86
to social media where, oh, you know what,

2172
01:28:57.86 --> 01:28:59.98
Billy's depressed and he seems like he's getting

2173
01:28:59.98 --> 01:29:01.50
a lot of attention for being depressed.

2174
01:29:01.50 --> 01:29:02.74
And I kind of, you know,

2175
01:29:03.86 --> 01:29:05.86
I didn't have anything to do on Friday night.

2176
01:29:05.86 --> 01:29:07.42
And so I'm probably not that popular.

2177
01:29:07.42 --> 01:29:09.02
I'm actually gonna be depressed too.

2178
01:29:09.02 --> 01:29:11.58
How much is that impacting people?

2179
01:29:11.58 --> 01:29:15.06
Because let's face it, you know, 100 years ago,

2180
01:29:15.06 --> 01:29:16.82
people weren't talking about this.

2181
01:29:16.82 --> 01:29:18.22
And so what were they doing?

2182
01:29:18.22 --> 01:29:19.26
You know, like, oh, I'm depressed,

2183
01:29:19.26 --> 01:29:20.10
but that's just the way I feel.

2184
01:29:20.10 --> 01:29:21.42
And they didn't even have a name for it.

2185
01:29:21.42 --> 01:29:22.26
So guess what they did?

2186
01:29:22.26 --> 01:29:23.50
They went to work and they carried on

2187
01:29:23.50 --> 01:29:26.86
and maybe they didn't feel great, but they carried on.

2188
01:29:26.86 --> 01:29:31.14
What role is this total connectedness that we have

2189
01:29:31.14 --> 01:29:34.26
and you know, we all can't even compare

2190
01:29:34.26 --> 01:29:39.10
to the 15 year olds that are connected

2191
01:29:39.10 --> 01:29:42.50
like 100% of the time that they're awake,

2192
01:29:42.50 --> 01:29:44.90
they're connecting and being influenced

2193
01:29:44.90 --> 01:29:47.78
by everyone else in the world.

2194
01:29:47.78 --> 01:29:49.58
What impact have you all seen from that?

2195
01:29:52.82 --> 01:29:54.06
It's substantial.

2196
01:29:54.06 --> 01:29:56.62
And I think it is with the onset.

2197
01:29:56.62 --> 01:30:00.02
In fact, I think it around like when smartphones happened.

2198
01:30:00.02 --> 01:30:00.86
Oh yeah.

2199
01:30:00.86 --> 01:30:02.50
That's where I kind of, like the internet was already there.

2200
01:30:02.50 --> 01:30:04.14
You could go online and look at a bunch of stuff,

2201
01:30:04.14 --> 01:30:06.06
but at your fingertips.

2202
01:30:06.06 --> 01:30:08.46
And now with, you know, Instagram and all the things,

2203
01:30:08.46 --> 01:30:10.58
I mean, you're just constantly looking,

2204
01:30:10.58 --> 01:30:12.18
who's doing what, who's saying what,

2205
01:30:12.18 --> 01:30:14.26
who's endorsing what, who's against what

2206
01:30:14.26 --> 01:30:17.74
and the attachment to all of that.

2207
01:30:17.74 --> 01:30:20.66
And also the social disconnect,

2208
01:30:20.66 --> 01:30:23.18
like from other human beings versus,

2209
01:30:23.18 --> 01:30:25.90
instead of having a conversation with you

2210
01:30:25.90 --> 01:30:27.78
or asking you your opinion about something

2211
01:30:27.78 --> 01:30:29.54
or going to you to talk about something

2212
01:30:29.54 --> 01:30:30.74
that might be on my mind,

2213
01:30:30.74 --> 01:30:32.78
I'm looking to see who's saying what

2214
01:30:32.78 --> 01:30:34.58
and what are other people doing about it.

2215
01:30:34.58 --> 01:30:36.38
Which is influencing my feed

2216
01:30:36.38 --> 01:30:37.66
and all the things that are coming out

2217
01:30:37.66 --> 01:30:38.50
of the algorithm.

2218
01:30:38.50 --> 01:30:41.66
Like how many, like I didn't get as many likes as you got.

2219
01:30:41.66 --> 01:30:43.54
What does that mean about me?

2220
01:30:44.74 --> 01:30:46.62
In addition to what you were saying earlier

2221
01:30:46.62 --> 01:30:48.82
about like the self-diagnosing.

2222
01:30:48.82 --> 01:30:50.14
Oh, I read it, you know, how many times,

2223
01:30:50.14 --> 01:30:52.26
especially with the adolescents I see.

2224
01:30:52.26 --> 01:30:54.90
Oh, I read an article, I think I have OCD in my mind.

2225
01:30:54.90 --> 01:30:57.54
Like, you don't, let's talk about that.

2226
01:30:57.54 --> 01:30:59.94
Or, oh, I read an article and this is happening to me.

2227
01:30:59.94 --> 01:31:01.94
So I think I might have stomach cancer.

2228
01:31:03.18 --> 01:31:05.42
It's, we'll send you to the doctor

2229
01:31:05.42 --> 01:31:06.50
if you want to have that checked out.

2230
01:31:06.50 --> 01:31:07.78
But let's talk about your,

2231
01:31:07.78 --> 01:31:09.30
that you woke up with a stomach ache.

2232
01:31:09.30 --> 01:31:11.98
Because you have a job interview this afternoon

2233
01:31:11.98 --> 01:31:14.82
that you kind of don't want to go to.

2234
01:31:14.82 --> 01:31:16.02
Let's talk about that instead.

2235
01:31:16.02 --> 01:31:17.66
But no, I looked online, I looked online.

2236
01:31:17.66 --> 01:31:19.66
If you wake up with a stomach ache, it means this.

2237
01:31:19.66 --> 01:31:23.14
Right, so this, whether it's looking up symptoms

2238
01:31:23.14 --> 01:31:24.66
and diagnoses or what this means

2239
01:31:24.66 --> 01:31:26.26
or what other people are doing

2240
01:31:26.26 --> 01:31:27.62
or what other people are saying about

2241
01:31:27.62 --> 01:31:29.18
what other people are doing.

2242
01:31:29.18 --> 01:31:32.86
It's just, it's like it's defined.

2243
01:31:32.86 --> 01:31:37.34
Right, self-diagnosis becomes self-fulfilling prophecy as well.

2244
01:31:37.34 --> 01:31:39.14
Well, and the persons, you know what they're,

2245
01:31:39.14 --> 01:31:41.02
they're out their world outside of social media

2246
01:31:41.02 --> 01:31:43.10
looks like their family, how much they can, you know,

2247
01:31:43.10 --> 01:31:45.26
cross-reference the things that they're seeing on there

2248
01:31:45.26 --> 01:31:47.34
with like a parent who's telling them like,

2249
01:31:47.34 --> 01:31:49.38
let's think about that, let's walk that through.

2250
01:31:49.38 --> 01:31:52.98
Like if depending on how much exposure they have to that,

2251
01:31:52.98 --> 01:31:55.18
outside of that world is gonna make a big difference

2252
01:31:55.18 --> 01:31:57.74
in terms of the impact of being engrossed

2253
01:31:57.74 --> 01:31:59.10
in the social media world.

2254
01:31:59.10 --> 01:32:02.22
Because not all kiddos have a family

2255
01:32:02.22 --> 01:32:03.94
who's willing to talk them through all the things

2256
01:32:03.94 --> 01:32:05.18
that they're seeing on social media,

2257
01:32:05.18 --> 01:32:07.62
help them discern what they read, these sorts of things.

2258
01:32:07.62 --> 01:32:10.62
So definitely a balance outside of that

2259
01:32:10.62 --> 01:32:14.70
is necessary to combat the influence within social media.

2260
01:32:14.70 --> 01:32:17.74
Well, then there's also the part of having things

2261
01:32:17.74 --> 01:32:20.22
just available, right, right now, right now is,

2262
01:32:20.22 --> 01:32:22.34
like I think about when I went growing up,

2263
01:32:22.34 --> 01:32:24.50
like there were no, there were,

2264
01:32:24.50 --> 01:32:26.42
I didn't even, we didn't have an answering machine.

2265
01:32:26.42 --> 01:32:28.54
Like if you wanted to call somebody, you called them

2266
01:32:28.54 --> 01:32:30.06
and if they were there, they would pick up

2267
01:32:30.06 --> 01:32:31.34
and if they weren't, they didn't.

2268
01:32:31.34 --> 01:32:32.66
Like that was it.

2269
01:32:32.66 --> 01:32:34.22
You called them back later.

2270
01:32:34.22 --> 01:32:38.02
There was no texting, there was no this immediacy.

2271
01:32:38.02 --> 01:32:43.02
So thinking about not having that immediate gratification,

2272
01:32:44.98 --> 01:32:48.06
I and people in my generation and people who didn't have access

2273
01:32:48.06 --> 01:32:51.66
to some of these things developed patience

2274
01:32:51.66 --> 01:32:52.98
and tolerance skills.

2275
01:32:52.98 --> 01:32:54.94
Like I could wait, even if I really, really, really

2276
01:32:54.94 --> 01:32:56.10
wanna talk to you.

2277
01:32:56.10 --> 01:32:59.74
Like I can wait and not fall apart.

2278
01:32:59.74 --> 01:33:01.74
I had a client, well, I still see her,

2279
01:33:01.74 --> 01:33:05.78
but when she was younger, her parents are fantastic.

2280
01:33:05.78 --> 01:33:08.70
She is like, the very self-diagnose,

2281
01:33:08.70 --> 01:33:13.22
has no tolerance for delayed gratification or patience

2282
01:33:13.22 --> 01:33:14.22
because everything, right?

2283
01:33:14.22 --> 01:33:15.98
Everything is an immediate answer.

2284
01:33:15.98 --> 01:33:18.86
If I text you and you have not, if I see the dots

2285
01:33:18.86 --> 01:33:20.98
and then you don't get back to me,

2286
01:33:20.98 --> 01:33:22.62
like this kind of thing.

2287
01:33:22.62 --> 01:33:25.10
So she did something and got herself in trouble.

2288
01:33:25.10 --> 01:33:26.66
So her parents took her phone.

2289
01:33:27.62 --> 01:33:28.94
She said, if you take my phone,

2290
01:33:28.94 --> 01:33:30.90
I'm gonna kill myself.

2291
01:33:30.90 --> 01:33:32.18
I can't not have my phone.

2292
01:33:32.18 --> 01:33:34.54
They put her in the car and took her to the emergency room.

2293
01:33:34.54 --> 01:33:36.66
I thought that was the most brilliant thing ever.

2294
01:33:36.66 --> 01:33:38.26
And of course, by the time they walk in,

2295
01:33:38.26 --> 01:33:39.86
she's like, nevermind, I won't kill myself.

2296
01:33:39.86 --> 01:33:43.42
I'll get my phone back whenever you wanna give it to me.

2297
01:33:43.42 --> 01:33:46.14
But it was that instant, like I can't live.

2298
01:33:46.14 --> 01:33:48.70
Like I cannot not have my phone.

2299
01:33:48.70 --> 01:33:52.82
And she has no emotional, like at the time,

2300
01:33:52.82 --> 01:33:55.02
like no emotional management skills.

2301
01:33:55.02 --> 01:33:56.18
How old?

2302
01:33:56.18 --> 01:33:59.86
She was probably 15 or 16 at this point, like old enough.

2303
01:34:00.82 --> 01:34:02.90
But I think about all the parents that would be like,

2304
01:34:02.90 --> 01:34:04.58
oh my, okay, nevermind.

2305
01:34:04.58 --> 01:34:05.90
Yeah.

2306
01:34:05.90 --> 01:34:06.74
Right?

2307
01:34:06.74 --> 01:34:09.82
And so now you just reinforced that if you're upset

2308
01:34:09.82 --> 01:34:11.46
or you don't think you can handle something,

2309
01:34:11.46 --> 01:34:13.98
just I'll make it easy for you so that

2310
01:34:16.54 --> 01:34:19.90
a delay of gratification, managing anxiety,

2311
01:34:19.90 --> 01:34:22.94
tolerating, waiting, and then what do you do?

2312
01:34:22.94 --> 01:34:24.42
Like if I wanna talk to you

2313
01:34:24.42 --> 01:34:26.26
and you're not answering the phone,

2314
01:34:27.18 --> 01:34:28.50
I'm not gonna just like sit there.

2315
01:34:28.50 --> 01:34:29.70
Like right now people sit there,

2316
01:34:29.70 --> 01:34:31.10
or they sit on their phone,

2317
01:34:31.10 --> 01:34:34.10
versus like you go do something to manage your anxiety

2318
01:34:34.10 --> 01:34:37.74
or your distress at not being able to talk to your person.

2319
01:34:37.74 --> 01:34:40.14
Like we, like I grew up with that.

2320
01:34:40.14 --> 01:34:45.14
People nowadays, they're in a lot of ways are lacking

2321
01:34:45.38 --> 01:34:47.62
in those skills of just managing their feelings

2322
01:34:47.62 --> 01:34:48.94
because they don't have to.

2323
01:34:48.94 --> 01:34:51.26
Have you heard the expression left on red?

2324
01:34:51.26 --> 01:34:52.10
Have you ever heard of this?

2325
01:34:52.10 --> 01:34:52.94
Yes.

2326
01:34:52.94 --> 01:34:53.78
So it's when, yeah.

2327
01:34:53.78 --> 01:34:54.12
My kids talk about that.

2328
01:34:54.12 --> 01:34:55.54
So it's when you're,

2329
01:34:57.22 --> 01:34:59.14
I send you a message, Karlyn,

2330
01:34:59.14 --> 01:35:02.34
and I get a thing that says you read it,

2331
01:35:02.34 --> 01:35:03.70
but you don't respond to me.

2332
01:35:03.70 --> 01:35:05.50
So you just left me on, you read it,

2333
01:35:05.50 --> 01:35:06.34
but you don't respond to me.

2334
01:35:06.34 --> 01:35:07.18
Oh my God.

2335
01:35:07.18 --> 01:35:08.02
It's devastating.

2336
01:35:08.02 --> 01:35:08.86
I've heard about it.

2337
01:35:08.86 --> 01:35:09.70
It's catastrophic.

2338
01:35:09.70 --> 01:35:10.54
Yeah, it's a great thing.

2339
01:35:10.54 --> 01:35:12.02
For one, to not get an immediate response

2340
01:35:12.02 --> 01:35:13.50
and then to be left on red is like,

2341
01:35:13.50 --> 01:35:14.82
you might as well have been canceled,

2342
01:35:14.82 --> 01:35:16.10
is the other term.

2343
01:35:16.10 --> 01:35:19.10
So this stuff is gonna impact people.

2344
01:35:19.10 --> 01:35:21.02
I mean, that's an impact psychologically.

2345
01:35:21.02 --> 01:35:22.42
Yes, huge.

2346
01:35:22.42 --> 01:35:24.38
Because we're just expecting everyone

2347
01:35:24.38 --> 01:35:27.02
to maintain connection all the time.

2348
01:35:27.02 --> 01:35:27.94
And soothes me.

2349
01:35:27.94 --> 01:35:30.14
When I'm upset, you need to reply.

2350
01:35:30.14 --> 01:35:32.30
So I don't have anxious feelings.

2351
01:35:32.30 --> 01:35:34.70
And the social media companies

2352
01:35:34.70 --> 01:35:36.74
are creating these things.

2353
01:35:36.74 --> 01:35:38.62
Like TikTok is created to be as addictive

2354
01:35:38.62 --> 01:35:40.58
as possible, as humanly possible.

2355
01:35:40.58 --> 01:35:42.86
So it's immediate gratification 100% of the time.

2356
01:35:42.86 --> 01:35:44.78
It's just like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2357
01:35:44.78 --> 01:35:46.38
And you can't put that thing down.

2358
01:35:47.54 --> 01:35:49.02
This is a nightmare, isn't it?

2359
01:35:49.02 --> 01:35:50.66
Well, and if you see it show up a lot

2360
01:35:50.66 --> 01:35:52.82
in folks coming into work, younger ages

2361
01:35:52.82 --> 01:35:56.46
between 20 to 24, and you refer to a lot

2362
01:35:56.46 --> 01:35:57.94
as like being entitled, right?

2363
01:35:57.94 --> 01:35:59.50
You hear this term entitlement thrown a lot.

2364
01:35:59.50 --> 01:36:02.06
Like this generation is entitled entitlement and such.

2365
01:36:02.06 --> 01:36:05.22
But when you really look at what's going on,

2366
01:36:05.22 --> 01:36:07.62
there's very poor distress tolerance skills.

2367
01:36:07.62 --> 01:36:09.56
Like if there's something I need to wait on

2368
01:36:09.56 --> 01:36:12.02
or I'm waiting for an answer from my manager

2369
01:36:12.02 --> 01:36:14.46
for something or something needs to change.

2370
01:36:14.46 --> 01:36:16.38
It clearly needs to grow in the organization.

2371
01:36:16.38 --> 01:36:19.62
But it's taking some time to work through these things.

2372
01:36:19.62 --> 01:36:22.10
Like there's an immediate sort of narrative

2373
01:36:22.10 --> 01:36:23.66
that something must be wrong,

2374
01:36:23.66 --> 01:36:24.78
that this is a really negative thing.

2375
01:36:24.78 --> 01:36:27.26
People don't care about me or whatever that person goes

2376
01:36:27.26 --> 01:36:28.82
through and their poor distress tolerance.

2377
01:36:28.82 --> 01:36:30.06
And it creates all kinds of issues.

2378
01:36:30.06 --> 01:36:32.26
And then if I can't tolerate it, what do I do?

2379
01:36:32.26 --> 01:36:34.88
I just leave or I check out or stop caring

2380
01:36:34.88 --> 01:36:38.70
about what I'm doing or I can justify misusing

2381
01:36:38.70 --> 01:36:40.94
company resources or not really using my time.

2382
01:36:40.94 --> 01:36:42.30
I mean, there's all kinds of interesting things

2383
01:36:42.30 --> 01:36:44.46
that come from it, but at the core,

2384
01:36:44.46 --> 01:36:46.46
at least I'm not an expert on this at all,

2385
01:36:46.46 --> 01:36:49.26
but it's just some very poor distress tolerance.

2386
01:36:49.26 --> 01:36:51.14
Watching my kids work through some of that stuff

2387
01:36:51.14 --> 01:36:53.98
where if someone didn't reply to them,

2388
01:36:53.98 --> 01:36:56.94
like it felt sort of catastrophic

2389
01:36:56.94 --> 01:36:58.22
and helping them think through like,

2390
01:36:58.22 --> 01:37:00.46
what could possibly be some other options

2391
01:37:00.46 --> 01:37:02.54
as to why someone might not have responded.

2392
01:37:02.54 --> 01:37:03.78
And usually a few days later, it's like,

2393
01:37:03.78 --> 01:37:05.90
oh, it's everything, everything's cool, mom.

2394
01:37:05.90 --> 01:37:07.22
Someone's got their phone taken away.

2395
01:37:07.22 --> 01:37:08.34
So, oh, okay.

2396
01:37:08.34 --> 01:37:10.06
So that's why they didn't respond to you.

2397
01:37:10.06 --> 01:37:11.78
And your kids are freaking out.

2398
01:37:11.78 --> 01:37:12.82
I'm thinking that's the end of the world.

2399
01:37:12.82 --> 01:37:14.54
Something bad is happening for sure.

2400
01:37:14.54 --> 01:37:15.38
Yeah.

2401
01:37:17.02 --> 01:37:18.98
Can we talk through some mental health issues?

2402
01:37:18.98 --> 01:37:21.54
I got, I read through a bunch of these.

2403
01:37:21.54 --> 01:37:26.02
Anxiety disorder, fear and dread.

2404
01:37:27.18 --> 01:37:29.94
What's a cause for that?

2405
01:37:33.26 --> 01:37:36.70
And there's so many potential causes for that.

2406
01:37:36.70 --> 01:37:39.86
But I mean, ultimately it's a state in which you're sort of

2407
01:37:41.74 --> 01:37:44.22
assuming or maybe anticipating

2408
01:37:44.22 --> 01:37:47.90
that something very negative is going to happen, right?

2409
01:37:47.90 --> 01:37:51.06
I have this, I will just use a job interview coming up

2410
01:37:51.06 --> 01:37:53.38
and I really need this job,

2411
01:37:53.38 --> 01:37:55.14
but I'm definitely gonna say something wrong

2412
01:37:55.14 --> 01:37:55.98
and I'm gonna trip out.

2413
01:37:55.98 --> 01:37:59.14
I mean, it's just can sort of roll in that direction

2414
01:37:59.14 --> 01:38:01.54
with a person's thoughts in a lot of ways.

2415
01:38:01.54 --> 01:38:04.14
And then in their body can feel sick,

2416
01:38:04.14 --> 01:38:06.50
sick to my stomach, look like somatic symptoms.

2417
01:38:06.50 --> 01:38:08.22
So people express it in a lot of different ways.

2418
01:38:08.22 --> 01:38:10.58
Some you'll see a lot of thoughts related to it

2419
01:38:10.58 --> 01:38:12.22
that are very sort of negative

2420
01:38:12.22 --> 01:38:14.26
and anticipating something sort of horrible

2421
01:38:14.26 --> 01:38:16.02
is going to happen or not work out well.

2422
01:38:16.02 --> 01:38:18.90
And in some ways for some people it's very physical.

2423
01:38:18.90 --> 01:38:20.06
They're sick all the time,

2424
01:38:20.06 --> 01:38:23.74
we're often getting a cold or these sorts of things.

2425
01:38:23.74 --> 01:38:24.74
So.

2426
01:38:24.74 --> 01:38:25.78
And it's like a chain.

2427
01:38:25.78 --> 01:38:28.10
So job interview, right?

2428
01:38:28.10 --> 01:38:29.82
Well, I don't know, what if I say the wrong thing?

2429
01:38:29.82 --> 01:38:31.46
What if they ask me a question and I don't know?

2430
01:38:31.46 --> 01:38:32.38
Well, what if they don't like me?

2431
01:38:32.38 --> 01:38:33.74
What if I don't get the job?

2432
01:38:33.74 --> 01:38:36.38
What if it's that kind of chaining together?

2433
01:38:36.38 --> 01:38:39.86
So next thing, I might as well just not even,

2434
01:38:39.86 --> 01:38:41.86
I might as well kill myself.

2435
01:38:41.86 --> 01:38:44.42
I mean, it can go in a lot of different ways,

2436
01:38:44.42 --> 01:38:49.42
but this like persistent worry and anticipation

2437
01:38:51.30 --> 01:38:56.30
that is not proportionate to the situation.

2438
01:38:56.94 --> 01:38:59.62
Like it's one thing to have some nervousness.

2439
01:38:59.62 --> 01:39:02.02
I have this big job interview, I really want this job.

2440
01:39:02.02 --> 01:39:03.90
I hope they like me, I'm a little bit,

2441
01:39:04.90 --> 01:39:05.98
my stomach hurts a little bit.

2442
01:39:05.98 --> 01:39:08.74
That's one thing, but that disproportion

2443
01:39:08.74 --> 01:39:11.70
and that chaining together of all of the things

2444
01:39:11.70 --> 01:39:13.18
that could potentially happen.

2445
01:39:13.18 --> 01:39:14.42
So go ahead.

2446
01:39:14.42 --> 01:39:15.90
I was just saying, it's like the difference too between,

2447
01:39:15.90 --> 01:39:18.26
I think most of us experience some level of anxiety

2448
01:39:18.26 --> 01:39:19.90
around things that can actually be really helpful, right?

2449
01:39:19.90 --> 01:39:21.38
Help me to prepare for something.

2450
01:39:21.38 --> 01:39:23.26
But when it gets to the aspect of sort of clinically

2451
01:39:23.26 --> 01:39:25.98
significant, it's interfering in such a way that now,

2452
01:39:25.98 --> 01:39:27.54
I just called out of my job interview

2453
01:39:27.54 --> 01:39:30.42
or I'm choosing not to go or I couldn't,

2454
01:39:30.42 --> 01:39:32.02
I could even bring myself to study

2455
01:39:32.02 --> 01:39:34.30
because I was so anxious about the potential exam

2456
01:39:34.30 --> 01:39:39.46
and so it becomes almost self-sabotaging in some ways

2457
01:39:39.46 --> 01:39:41.78
as we move towards like a clinically significant version

2458
01:39:41.78 --> 01:39:42.62
of that.

2459
01:39:42.62 --> 01:39:46.14
So what is treatment like for someone that's in that zone?

2460
01:39:46.14 --> 01:39:47.74
I haven't been out of my house.

2461
01:39:47.74 --> 01:39:49.94
I didn't get the job, I didn't do go to the job interview.

2462
01:39:49.94 --> 01:39:51.98
I actually haven't even applied for any jobs.

2463
01:39:51.98 --> 01:39:56.58
I'm just getting by on whatever savings I had

2464
01:39:56.58 --> 01:39:58.62
and maybe starting to get some welfare checks

2465
01:39:58.62 --> 01:40:00.38
because I'm just freaked out because,

2466
01:40:00.38 --> 01:40:02.54
so what are you saying to me?

2467
01:40:02.54 --> 01:40:04.22
How do we talk someone through that?

2468
01:40:06.02 --> 01:40:08.38
Well, I mean, a lot of it has to do with,

2469
01:40:09.30 --> 01:40:11.22
well, I know we were talking about this before recording

2470
01:40:11.22 --> 01:40:15.90
that when somebody is that kind of agitated

2471
01:40:15.90 --> 01:40:19.18
and in distress, the front part of your brain,

2472
01:40:19.18 --> 01:40:21.42
the prefrontal cortex, which is the part we use

2473
01:40:21.42 --> 01:40:25.38
for like weighing pros and cons and anticipating outcomes

2474
01:40:25.38 --> 01:40:30.50
and kind of making decisions and thinking things through

2475
01:40:30.50 --> 01:40:32.14
is almost like not available.

2476
01:40:32.14 --> 01:40:33.06
It's almost offline.

2477
01:40:33.06 --> 01:40:34.74
You can think about it like it got knocked offline

2478
01:40:34.74 --> 01:40:36.58
because my nervous system is a wreck.

2479
01:40:36.58 --> 01:40:40.62
So the person really can't make really good decisions

2480
01:40:40.62 --> 01:40:44.22
when they're that kind of escalated.

2481
01:40:44.22 --> 01:40:47.94
So treatment will like undoubtedly, no matter what,

2482
01:40:47.94 --> 01:40:51.34
include helping a person learn skills and techniques

2483
01:40:51.34 --> 01:40:54.30
to like calm their, like literally calm

2484
01:40:54.30 --> 01:40:56.22
their physical body down.

2485
01:40:56.22 --> 01:40:57.50
It doesn't, I always tell people,

2486
01:40:57.50 --> 01:40:58.62
you don't have to be calm.

2487
01:40:58.62 --> 01:41:00.66
That would be lovely, but you don't have to be calm.

2488
01:41:00.66 --> 01:41:03.86
You just have to be calm enough for your brain.

2489
01:41:03.86 --> 01:41:06.10
What are some techniques you're gonna teach somebody?

2490
01:41:06.10 --> 01:41:08.86
It could be like deep breathing techniques,

2491
01:41:08.86 --> 01:41:12.54
meditation, grounding, physical activity

2492
01:41:12.54 --> 01:41:15.70
is really, really helpful for a dysregulated body,

2493
01:41:15.70 --> 01:41:20.10
like walking, running, jumping, swimming, yoga, plot,

2494
01:41:20.10 --> 01:41:21.74
whatever, physical activity,

2495
01:41:21.74 --> 01:41:25.10
because it's a physical manifestation of the anxiety.

2496
01:41:25.10 --> 01:41:29.78
So you gotta get the body to be able to relax enough

2497
01:41:29.78 --> 01:41:31.30
for the brain to come online.

2498
01:41:31.30 --> 01:41:33.90
So now once the brain is more available,

2499
01:41:33.90 --> 01:41:37.50
now we gotta go through all that cognitive distortion,

2500
01:41:37.50 --> 01:41:39.70
this idea that like, if you don't get this job,

2501
01:41:39.70 --> 01:41:40.98
you're a horrible person.

2502
01:41:40.98 --> 01:41:43.78
Like let's talk about how realistic that is.

2503
01:41:43.78 --> 01:41:45.94
Or if you don't get this job,

2504
01:41:45.94 --> 01:41:47.58
it means that you're never gonna get a job

2505
01:41:47.58 --> 01:41:48.74
for the rest of your life.

2506
01:41:48.74 --> 01:41:49.66
Well, let's look at that.

2507
01:41:49.66 --> 01:41:51.94
So cognitive behavioral therapy,

2508
01:41:51.94 --> 01:41:55.26
cognitive techniques will address some of those

2509
01:41:56.66 --> 01:41:59.10
really kind of extreme escalated thoughts.

2510
01:41:59.10 --> 01:42:00.38
So you need both.

2511
01:42:00.38 --> 01:42:03.94
I mean, most mental health and illness issues

2512
01:42:03.94 --> 01:42:05.46
are gonna require both,

2513
01:42:05.46 --> 01:42:07.50
but for anxiety, you really need both,

2514
01:42:07.50 --> 01:42:10.18
the physical and the cognitive.

2515
01:42:11.46 --> 01:42:12.42
As I was reading through this,

2516
01:42:12.42 --> 01:42:14.78
I ended up with these personality disorders

2517
01:42:14.78 --> 01:42:17.22
coming into these different categories.

2518
01:42:17.22 --> 01:42:20.26
Cluster A, Cluster B, and Cluster C.

2519
01:42:20.26 --> 01:42:23.38
Cluster A is just, they had some subtitles here.

2520
01:42:23.38 --> 01:42:25.50
Cluster A was odd.

2521
01:42:25.50 --> 01:42:26.34
Yep, odd.

2522
01:42:26.34 --> 01:42:30.14
Cluster B was dramatic, and Cluster C was anxious.

2523
01:42:30.14 --> 01:42:32.18
And I was like, well, you could kind of like

2524
01:42:32.18 --> 01:42:35.14
the stereotypical categories of people,

2525
01:42:35.14 --> 01:42:36.38
you know, that guy's weird, right?

2526
01:42:36.38 --> 01:42:37.58
That guy's an odd guy.

2527
01:42:38.86 --> 01:42:40.18
Someone that's paranoid.

2528
01:42:40.18 --> 01:42:42.42
Paranoid is one of the things in Cluster A, odd.

2529
01:42:42.42 --> 01:42:44.34
Paranoid always on guard.

2530
01:42:44.34 --> 01:42:46.70
Believe people are trying to harm them.

2531
01:42:47.94 --> 01:42:51.70
Skitsoid, which I didn't really know the definition of,

2532
01:42:51.70 --> 01:42:55.58
skitsoid is people that avoid people and relationships.

2533
01:42:55.58 --> 01:42:57.10
So tell me about paranoid.

2534
01:42:57.10 --> 01:42:58.10
Well, give me a case.

2535
01:42:58.10 --> 01:42:59.10
Let me read you to find out.

2536
01:42:59.10 --> 01:43:00.06
Let me hear a case.

2537
01:43:00.06 --> 01:43:02.46
I wanna hear some case studies of paranoid.

2538
01:43:02.46 --> 01:43:03.30
So funny.

2539
01:43:03.30 --> 01:43:07.26
You know, the black helicopters are out there flying around.

2540
01:43:07.26 --> 01:43:10.42
Well, you said earlier actually about like a person

2541
01:43:10.42 --> 01:43:12.78
who might already be a little bit,

2542
01:43:12.78 --> 01:43:15.74
save me, predisposed to like conspiracy, right?

2543
01:43:15.74 --> 01:43:19.10
So with personality disorders, it's not,

2544
01:43:20.14 --> 01:43:21.34
it's more like a part of your,

2545
01:43:21.34 --> 01:43:22.90
like I can be a shy person,

2546
01:43:22.90 --> 01:43:25.98
which means I'm probably gonna be shy like across the board,

2547
01:43:25.98 --> 01:43:27.98
right, not just in one or two situations.

2548
01:43:27.98 --> 01:43:30.38
So with personality disorders, it's one of those like,

2549
01:43:30.38 --> 01:43:32.50
kind of in most situations you're gonna see.

2550
01:43:32.50 --> 01:43:36.22
So paranoid, it might be not the helicopters are chasing me.

2551
01:43:36.22 --> 01:43:40.38
That's probably you're more in the psychotic,

2552
01:43:40.38 --> 01:43:42.46
psychosis realm there.

2553
01:43:42.46 --> 01:43:44.42
Personality disorders might be just kind of

2554
01:43:44.42 --> 01:43:46.26
a general paranoia like,

2555
01:43:46.26 --> 01:43:49.26
well, you know, every time I go to work,

2556
01:43:49.26 --> 01:43:51.18
I say hi to the girl at the desk and she says,

2557
01:43:51.18 --> 01:43:52.78
and say hi to me, I think she doesn't like me.

2558
01:43:52.78 --> 01:43:57.78
She probably, XYZ, like a leaning or a disposition

2559
01:43:58.42 --> 01:44:00.98
to thinking people don't like me.

2560
01:44:00.98 --> 01:44:02.06
I think people are watching me.

2561
01:44:02.06 --> 01:44:03.70
I think somebody went into my locker

2562
01:44:03.70 --> 01:44:05.34
and took something out, I think.

2563
01:44:06.22 --> 01:44:07.70
I found it at home later that night.

2564
01:44:07.70 --> 01:44:12.70
Like my predisposition is paranoid versus psychosis,

2565
01:44:13.50 --> 01:44:15.38
which is gonna be the helicopters are chasing me

2566
01:44:15.38 --> 01:44:18.86
and the lights are secretly filming me.

2567
01:44:18.86 --> 01:44:22.26
The, I mentioned that thing earlier where I said,

2568
01:44:22.26 --> 01:44:24.14
I told people on my training course, like,

2569
01:44:24.14 --> 01:44:25.02
hey, we're all insane.

2570
01:44:25.02 --> 01:44:26.02
We're all some level of insane

2571
01:44:26.02 --> 01:44:27.14
because reality was different.

2572
01:44:27.14 --> 01:44:28.18
These things are the same too.

2573
01:44:28.18 --> 01:44:31.02
Like everyone's got some level of paranoia

2574
01:44:31.02 --> 01:44:32.98
and you can see it come out of people.

2575
01:44:32.98 --> 01:44:35.70
You know, got that person, I work with leaders a lot

2576
01:44:35.70 --> 01:44:37.62
and you know, a leader that might be like,

2577
01:44:37.62 --> 01:44:38.86
well, I'm never gonna get promoted.

2578
01:44:38.86 --> 01:44:39.70
Oh, why is that?

2579
01:44:39.70 --> 01:44:40.54
Oh, they don't like me.

2580
01:44:40.54 --> 01:44:42.82
Like it's just a level of paranoia.

2581
01:44:42.82 --> 01:44:44.38
That's, and you choose it

2582
01:44:44.38 --> 01:44:45.78
because well, actually you're not getting promoted

2583
01:44:45.78 --> 01:44:48.14
because you failed on your last two projects.

2584
01:44:48.14 --> 01:44:50.22
Has nothing to do with them not liking you.

2585
01:44:50.22 --> 01:44:51.78
You're not performing well.

2586
01:44:51.78 --> 01:44:53.70
But of course for them, it's they don't like me.

2587
01:44:53.70 --> 01:44:54.54
Why don't they like you?

2588
01:44:54.54 --> 01:44:56.98
Well, because I used to work at this other company

2589
01:44:56.98 --> 01:44:59.22
and that guy worked there and they don't like that guy.

2590
01:44:59.22 --> 01:45:00.70
And so therefore they don't like me.

2591
01:45:00.70 --> 01:45:03.54
So like all these things and anxiety, you know, right?

2592
01:45:03.54 --> 01:45:06.14
We talk about, you just mentioned Megan's like,

2593
01:45:06.14 --> 01:45:07.46
a certain level of anxiety is good.

2594
01:45:07.46 --> 01:45:08.50
So it's okay.

2595
01:45:08.50 --> 01:45:10.22
Hey, I'm nervous about this job interview

2596
01:45:10.22 --> 01:45:11.34
because I really wanna get the job.

2597
01:45:11.34 --> 01:45:12.66
So I'm there for research the company.

2598
01:45:12.66 --> 01:45:13.50
I'm gonna be prepared.

2599
01:45:13.50 --> 01:45:14.90
Well, I'm gonna go over some notes.

2600
01:45:14.90 --> 01:45:15.74
I'm gonna be ready.

2601
01:45:15.74 --> 01:45:16.58
That's cool.

2602
01:45:16.58 --> 01:45:17.42
That's great.

2603
01:45:17.42 --> 01:45:21.30
So everyone has some level of these things going on.

2604
01:45:21.30 --> 01:45:24.14
It's just when we start to let them spiral

2605
01:45:24.14 --> 01:45:27.64
and get out of control, that's when we have problems.

2606
01:45:27.64 --> 01:45:32.28
So cluster A were acting a little strange,

2607
01:45:32.28 --> 01:45:37.08
cluster B dramatic, which is this also known

2608
01:45:37.08 --> 01:45:38.64
as teenage years a little bit?

2609
01:45:40.04 --> 01:45:42.52
Oftentimes with some of that, you'll find, you know,

2610
01:45:42.52 --> 01:45:44.88
some form of an attachment disruption

2611
01:45:44.88 --> 01:45:46.96
or something happening during that time period

2612
01:45:46.96 --> 01:45:49.20
that leads to some of this in more adult life

2613
01:45:49.20 --> 01:45:50.68
where we're looking at like a pattern

2614
01:45:50.68 --> 01:45:54.40
of unstable relationships or sort of this real

2615
01:45:54.40 --> 01:45:57.02
or imagined fear of abandonment that leads me

2616
01:45:57.02 --> 01:45:59.60
to sort of be dramatic if that's what you,

2617
01:45:59.60 --> 01:46:01.80
the word you wanna use in relationships

2618
01:46:01.80 --> 01:46:04.28
and such in response to a perception

2619
01:46:04.28 --> 01:46:06.44
that I might be losing you a lot of push, pull,

2620
01:46:06.44 --> 01:46:07.28
these sorts of things.

2621
01:46:07.28 --> 01:46:09.40
But I think we can find often in this group

2622
01:46:09.40 --> 01:46:11.36
that there's some something that happened

2623
01:46:11.36 --> 01:46:14.48
in the attachment that led to this disposition for.

2624
01:46:14.48 --> 01:46:16.58
What kind of thing is happening?

2625
01:46:16.58 --> 01:46:18.48
I mean, it can be a wide variety of things.

2626
01:46:18.48 --> 01:46:21.40
It can be various levels of abuse, sexual abuse,

2627
01:46:21.40 --> 01:46:24.44
physical abuse could be a very misattuned parent

2628
01:46:24.44 --> 01:46:27.16
or maybe not having somebody who could reflect back

2629
01:46:27.16 --> 01:46:29.80
to you at a young age, mirroring sort of like,

2630
01:46:29.80 --> 01:46:32.64
you know, I feel sad or I feel afraid.

2631
01:46:32.64 --> 01:46:34.08
It's sort of normal to feel that way

2632
01:46:34.08 --> 01:46:35.76
instead of like don't feel that way

2633
01:46:35.76 --> 01:46:37.76
or there's something wrong with you for feeling that way.

2634
01:46:37.76 --> 01:46:39.04
And I start to build these beliefs

2635
01:46:39.04 --> 01:46:42.04
where I sort of lose touch with my map

2636
01:46:42.04 --> 01:46:45.16
for like an appropriate emotional response

2637
01:46:45.16 --> 01:46:47.000
to what's happening.

2638
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.64
You can kind of find that disruption.

2639
01:46:48.64 --> 01:46:50.24
And sometimes with when you're looking

2640
01:46:50.24 --> 01:46:53.000
at a personality disorder, something has been so severe

2641
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.84
that now it is part of the personality in some ways.

2642
01:46:56.84 --> 01:46:59.76
And so you can shape it and kind of lose some things

2643
01:46:59.76 --> 01:47:01.48
with the volume of it, but that disposition

2644
01:47:01.48 --> 01:47:03.48
might always be there to be sort of like,

2645
01:47:04.40 --> 01:47:08.48
you know, someone, my friend canceled dinner on me again.

2646
01:47:08.48 --> 01:47:09.80
They must really not like me

2647
01:47:09.80 --> 01:47:11.80
or must not be important to them as opposed to like,

2648
01:47:11.80 --> 01:47:13.76
maybe there's something else going on for them

2649
01:47:13.76 --> 01:47:16.36
as to why they canceled dinner.

2650
01:47:16.36 --> 01:47:20.48
But it really does feel that traumatic to the person.

2651
01:47:20.48 --> 01:47:22.16
And I think that's a really important part of working

2652
01:47:22.16 --> 01:47:23.68
with someone with a personality disorder

2653
01:47:23.68 --> 01:47:27.04
is recognizing that while it might look sort of irrational

2654
01:47:27.04 --> 01:47:28.20
and you're like, what's going on for them,

2655
01:47:28.20 --> 01:47:29.80
it feels very real.

2656
01:47:29.80 --> 01:47:33.48
So this piece of like, how do I calm down the body enough

2657
01:47:33.48 --> 01:47:37.16
to bring the brain online to be able to just consider

2658
01:47:37.16 --> 01:47:40.72
what else might be possible is a super important part

2659
01:47:40.72 --> 01:47:42.36
of helping somebody through that.

2660
01:47:42.36 --> 01:47:44.000
And you can see with time,

2661
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.76
with like an appropriate level of support

2662
01:47:45.76 --> 01:47:48.44
and period of time and multiple reparative experiences

2663
01:47:48.44 --> 01:47:51.28
and relationships where the thing that I feared

2664
01:47:51.28 --> 01:47:53.20
didn't actually happen that some of this

2665
01:47:53.20 --> 01:47:55.08
can calm down a little bit.

2666
01:47:55.08 --> 01:47:58.04
You'll see, especially in what's considered cluster B,

2667
01:48:01.68 --> 01:48:05.60
people who have been adopted,

2668
01:48:05.60 --> 01:48:07.36
given up for adoption early on,

2669
01:48:07.36 --> 01:48:11.32
or in a way that was left them for some period of time

2670
01:48:11.32 --> 01:48:14.12
without kind of a secure, like a parent

2671
01:48:14.12 --> 01:48:15.64
or authority attachment.

2672
01:48:15.64 --> 01:48:20.64
Clients who, like one client who is,

2673
01:48:21.60 --> 01:48:25.96
she's the definition of that was neglected,

2674
01:48:25.96 --> 01:48:28.64
like severely neglected when she was a child.

2675
01:48:28.64 --> 01:48:33.64
So this anxiety of like being left or not being wanted

2676
01:48:34.04 --> 01:48:39.04
or being, like picking somebody other than her,

2677
01:48:39.08 --> 01:48:42.56
like this felt sense of rejection is so profound.

2678
01:48:42.56 --> 01:48:44.84
It almost, it's like her lenses.

2679
01:48:44.84 --> 01:48:48.60
It just, it's like her experience in the world

2680
01:48:48.60 --> 01:48:51.80
with other people is always through this lens of like,

2681
01:48:51.80 --> 01:48:52.68
do you like me?

2682
01:48:52.68 --> 01:48:53.96
Are you gonna pick me?

2683
01:48:55.48 --> 01:48:57.24
Like, am I safe?

2684
01:48:57.24 --> 01:48:58.20
Can I rely on you?

2685
01:48:58.20 --> 01:48:59.60
Can I trust you?

2686
01:48:59.60 --> 01:49:01.52
So these are, that can be rough.

2687
01:49:01.52 --> 01:49:03.44
Is this, one of these things was called

2688
01:49:03.44 --> 01:49:05.96
histrionic, histrionic personality disorder,

2689
01:49:05.96 --> 01:49:07.92
which in one of the categories in there

2690
01:49:07.92 --> 01:49:10.08
was desire to be noticed.

2691
01:49:10.08 --> 01:49:12.04
This is a similar thing where I just want people

2692
01:49:12.04 --> 01:49:13.52
to see that I'm here.

2693
01:49:13.52 --> 01:49:14.92
Well, and you know what I would say,

2694
01:49:14.92 --> 01:49:16.24
I say this a lot clinically too,

2695
01:49:16.24 --> 01:49:18.24
is this idea that like, oh, the person,

2696
01:49:18.24 --> 01:49:19.36
she's like seeking attention.

2697
01:49:19.36 --> 01:49:20.32
She's attention seeking.

2698
01:49:20.32 --> 01:49:21.84
That's very common, right?

2699
01:49:21.84 --> 01:49:23.24
Term that's used.

2700
01:49:23.24 --> 01:49:27.76
And, but often used in like a judgmental,

2701
01:49:27.76 --> 01:49:29.40
judgmental, derogatory way.

2702
01:49:29.40 --> 01:49:32.12
I would say like, oh, they're absolutely seeking attention,

2703
01:49:32.12 --> 01:49:34.72
but not because they're just being like,

2704
01:49:34.72 --> 01:49:36.000
you know, irritating.

2705
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.48
It's something is going on for this person internally

2706
01:49:38.48 --> 01:49:41.64
that they like literally need you to stop

2707
01:49:41.64 --> 01:49:43.64
and like pay attention to me.

2708
01:49:43.64 --> 01:49:47.20
So I can, something inside of me settles down.

2709
01:49:47.20 --> 01:49:49.36
Now this is a huge dysregulation, right?

2710
01:49:49.36 --> 01:49:52.96
So this is where in terms of therapy and treatment comes in

2711
01:49:52.96 --> 01:49:55.52
as helping people learn how to regulate their body

2712
01:49:55.52 --> 01:49:58.000
and like calm some of that agitation down

2713
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.32
and then do all the cognitive work of helping like,

2714
01:50:02.60 --> 01:50:05.04
reality check, like right, kind of sort through some

2715
01:50:05.04 --> 01:50:07.28
of these big extreme thoughts that I have to be like,

2716
01:50:07.28 --> 01:50:09.12
are they really that realistic?

2717
01:50:09.12 --> 01:50:11.04
And then like you have said a couple times,

2718
01:50:11.04 --> 01:50:13.40
Megan, the reparative experiences, like,

2719
01:50:14.80 --> 01:50:16.60
you know, how many times did you think,

2720
01:50:16.60 --> 01:50:18.60
like I have a client who for the longest time,

2721
01:50:18.60 --> 01:50:23.04
she would show up like 15, 20 minutes early to her session

2722
01:50:23.04 --> 01:50:27.20
because she had this idea that what if she's not out there

2723
01:50:27.20 --> 01:50:30.32
at the time of our session and I forget we had a session

2724
01:50:30.32 --> 01:50:32.92
and I leave, which first of all, it would never,

2725
01:50:32.92 --> 01:50:35.60
ever happen in a million years ever.

2726
01:50:35.60 --> 01:50:38.76
But like this was the one who grew up with a lot of neglect,

2727
01:50:38.76 --> 01:50:40.52
grew up with parents saying, oh yeah,

2728
01:50:40.52 --> 01:50:43.08
I'll be home in a few hours and they didn't come home

2729
01:50:43.08 --> 01:50:46.40
or they forgot about her, right?

2730
01:50:46.40 --> 01:50:49.24
So you can see where like the early stuff shaped this,

2731
01:50:49.24 --> 01:50:53.24
but a lot of our work was, it wasn't just like saying,

2732
01:50:53.24 --> 01:50:56.88
hey, we've had 72 sessions and I've been here every time,

2733
01:50:56.88 --> 01:50:58.44
like, isn't that enough?

2734
01:50:58.44 --> 01:50:59.92
That wasn't enough for her.

2735
01:50:59.92 --> 01:51:02.12
Like she needed to really go through the experience

2736
01:51:02.12 --> 01:51:05.64
of not relying on me to be there on time

2737
01:51:05.64 --> 01:51:06.64
so that she felt better.

2738
01:51:06.64 --> 01:51:08.40
She had to learn how to do that for herself.

2739
01:51:08.40 --> 01:51:11.52
It's that external scaffolding versus the internal.

2740
01:51:11.52 --> 01:51:12.64
And was she able to?

2741
01:51:12.64 --> 01:51:13.48
Yeah, totally.

2742
01:51:13.48 --> 01:51:14.32
I still see her.

2743
01:51:14.32 --> 01:51:15.14
She's great.

2744
01:51:15.14 --> 01:51:16.40
You still see her, but she,

2745
01:51:16.40 --> 01:51:18.44
but it's more like just checking in.

2746
01:51:18.44 --> 01:51:19.84
Yeah, and it's more like maintenance.

2747
01:51:19.84 --> 01:51:21.36
I see her once or twice a month.

2748
01:51:21.36 --> 01:51:23.24
I used to see her two, three times a week

2749
01:51:23.24 --> 01:51:26.92
because the level of distress and interference

2750
01:51:26.92 --> 01:51:28.56
in her life, like she couldn't work,

2751
01:51:28.56 --> 01:51:30.16
her relationships were a mess.

2752
01:51:30.16 --> 01:51:32.20
She was on all these medication.

2753
01:51:32.20 --> 01:51:35.44
I mean, she had a really, really messy life

2754
01:51:35.44 --> 01:51:36.88
because this is how she lived it.

2755
01:51:36.88 --> 01:51:39.60
This is how she approached almost every relationship

2756
01:51:39.60 --> 01:51:41.28
she had in her world.

2757
01:51:41.28 --> 01:51:43.44
So now like she's working, she's got kids,

2758
01:51:43.44 --> 01:51:44.92
she's just got back from like,

2759
01:51:46.68 --> 01:51:47.84
Bali or something, I don't know,

2760
01:51:47.84 --> 01:51:49.88
she went with her husband, like her life is great.

2761
01:51:49.88 --> 01:51:50.94
Some things are good.

2762
01:51:50.94 --> 01:51:52.36
So it's a little, it's a little maintenance,

2763
01:51:52.36 --> 01:51:55.40
like kind of maintenance, car maintenance.

2764
01:51:55.40 --> 01:51:58.60
She's getting her, her chin ups, everyone's gone.

2765
01:51:58.60 --> 01:51:59.44
Yeah, it's weird.

2766
01:51:59.44 --> 01:52:02.000
Cause all these things are, everyone listening

2767
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.60
can be like, oh yeah, I,

2768
01:52:03.60 --> 01:52:04.44
I have a little bit of that.

2769
01:52:04.44 --> 01:52:05.28
I have a little bit of that.

2770
01:52:05.28 --> 01:52:06.12
I have a little bit of that.

2771
01:52:06.12 --> 01:52:06.96
I have a little bit of this.

2772
01:52:06.96 --> 01:52:10.000
Well, another one in this category was narcissistic,

2773
01:52:11.20 --> 01:52:14.04
which, you know, when, when we work with leaders,

2774
01:52:14.04 --> 01:52:15.60
you know, a lot of times people that end up

2775
01:52:15.60 --> 01:52:16.52
in leadership positions,

2776
01:52:16.52 --> 01:52:18.52
they end up in leadership positions oftentimes

2777
01:52:18.52 --> 01:52:20.40
because they were stepping up and they thought

2778
01:52:20.40 --> 01:52:21.28
they could do the job.

2779
01:52:21.28 --> 01:52:22.76
And if you can think you can do the job,

2780
01:52:22.76 --> 01:52:24.80
that means you got a little bit of ego working.

2781
01:52:24.80 --> 01:52:26.48
And if you got a little bit of ego working,

2782
01:52:26.48 --> 01:52:28.16
sometimes that ego can start to expand

2783
01:52:28.16 --> 01:52:31.92
beyond your own control and you end up sometimes

2784
01:52:31.92 --> 01:52:33.64
with people that are narcissistic.

2785
01:52:33.64 --> 01:52:38.000
And what does that look like from like a clinical perspective?

2786
01:52:39.20 --> 01:52:40.04
I mean, I think when you,

2787
01:52:40.04 --> 01:52:42.04
you talk about this from like a clinical

2788
01:52:42.04 --> 01:52:43.24
where you're ending up in treatment,

2789
01:52:43.24 --> 01:52:46.68
it, it, it moves into a place where you have,

2790
01:52:47.64 --> 01:52:50.88
you lose sight of, I don't know if empathy is the right word

2791
01:52:50.88 --> 01:52:52.72
or like my impact on other people.

2792
01:52:52.72 --> 01:52:55.32
Like my focus becomes so much on like where I'm at,

2793
01:52:55.32 --> 01:52:58.000
my, my, my vision, whatever I have going on.

2794
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.36
And somehow along the way I lost sight of like

2795
01:53:00.36 --> 01:53:03.64
what I do impacts other people and like my behavior

2796
01:53:03.64 --> 01:53:05.12
has an impact on other people.

2797
01:53:05.12 --> 01:53:06.48
And so that's on the very severe end.

2798
01:53:06.48 --> 01:53:08.80
And I think when you're looking at the actual disorder itself

2799
01:53:08.80 --> 01:53:10.56
that word is thrown around a lot.

2800
01:53:10.56 --> 01:53:11.40
For sure.

2801
01:53:12.16 --> 01:53:15.16
But where we've seen it often really looks like

2802
01:53:15.16 --> 01:53:20.16
this person has becomes significantly self-focused

2803
01:53:20.52 --> 01:53:22.80
and really lose sight of how their behavior

2804
01:53:22.80 --> 01:53:24.12
impacts other people.

2805
01:53:24.12 --> 01:53:25.92
And they just don't care about anybody else.

2806
01:53:25.92 --> 01:53:27.20
It would appear that way.

2807
01:53:27.20 --> 01:53:29.60
I mean, I think what's really happening so much

2808
01:53:29.60 --> 01:53:33.24
is that there's the, the, the ego cannot tolerate

2809
01:53:33.24 --> 01:53:36.80
any sort of feedback that would suggest like, wow,

2810
01:53:36.80 --> 01:53:39.12
I might have hurt someone when I did that.

2811
01:53:39.12 --> 01:53:41.44
Like it, it's just so vulnerable.

2812
01:53:41.44 --> 01:53:43.40
Like it's actually this person, while they might appear

2813
01:53:43.40 --> 01:53:46.32
like it doesn't matter to them, they're actually so sensitive

2814
01:53:46.32 --> 01:53:48.76
and vulnerable that they've built up so many defenses

2815
01:53:48.76 --> 01:53:51.68
in their psyche to not allow for any sort of feedback

2816
01:53:51.68 --> 01:53:53.64
to crack through an idea of like, oh, in fact,

2817
01:53:53.64 --> 01:53:55.28
I could potentially fail.

2818
01:53:55.28 --> 01:53:58.08
Or in fact, like I could, I do have the potential

2819
01:53:58.08 --> 01:53:59.04
to hurt someone.

2820
01:53:59.04 --> 01:54:01.52
It's like, become so distorted in a way

2821
01:54:01.52 --> 01:54:04.20
that they, they can't even see that as a possibility.

2822
01:54:04.20 --> 01:54:06.32
And so then I come across in my behaviors

2823
01:54:06.32 --> 01:54:09.48
in such as very disregarding of others.

2824
01:54:09.48 --> 01:54:12.52
These, a person with a narcissist personality

2825
01:54:12.52 --> 01:54:14.72
is very easily wounded with your words.

2826
01:54:14.72 --> 01:54:18.04
They're not the person that you can give that sort of direct

2827
01:54:18.04 --> 01:54:18.88
feedback to.

2828
01:54:18.88 --> 01:54:21.80
They're so wounded that almost catastrophic

2829
01:54:21.80 --> 01:54:24.96
to the relationship sometimes to be able to give feedback.

2830
01:54:24.96 --> 01:54:28.96
And what you will see as opposed to some of the other

2831
01:54:28.96 --> 01:54:32.08
personalities, like the histrionic borderline

2832
01:54:32.08 --> 01:54:35.52
and they're easily, easily wounded with words,

2833
01:54:35.52 --> 01:54:37.40
very, very sensitive, but you're gonna see somebody

2834
01:54:37.40 --> 01:54:39.76
kind of melt down and cry.

2835
01:54:39.76 --> 01:54:41.72
And oh my gosh, I can't believe you said that to me.

2836
01:54:41.72 --> 01:54:45.04
You know, like kind of collapse a little bit

2837
01:54:45.04 --> 01:54:46.44
with narcissism.

2838
01:54:46.44 --> 01:54:47.28
Lash out.

2839
01:54:47.28 --> 01:54:50.36
Lash out and like cut you off, out, gone.

2840
01:54:50.36 --> 01:54:52.20
Like can, just cannot tolerate.

2841
01:54:52.20 --> 01:54:55.12
Like kind of being challenged.

2842
01:54:55.12 --> 01:54:56.12
Yeah.

2843
01:54:56.12 --> 01:54:59.28
Cluster C, which is, which is anxious.

2844
01:54:59.28 --> 01:55:03.40
This is when you get in the OCD, the obsessive compulsive.

2845
01:55:03.40 --> 01:55:05.80
Let me hear a wild OCD story.

2846
01:55:05.80 --> 01:55:06.64
Oh boy.

2847
01:55:06.64 --> 01:55:07.96
Let's see.

2848
01:55:07.96 --> 01:55:12.44
I don't know if I have a good one to go.

2849
01:55:12.44 --> 01:55:15.08
Well, I, I mean several.

2850
01:55:15.08 --> 01:55:18.96
And I think like we said before, there's,

2851
01:55:18.96 --> 01:55:20.88
people can have like kind of traits and like

2852
01:55:20.88 --> 01:55:22.52
the leanings and inclinations.

2853
01:55:22.52 --> 01:55:25.000
And that's one thing versus it being at a,

2854
01:55:26.12 --> 01:55:28.44
like a clinic clinically significant level

2855
01:55:28.44 --> 01:55:29.44
where you're like your life,

2856
01:55:29.44 --> 01:55:31.68
like you're having a hard time living your life.

2857
01:55:31.68 --> 01:55:36.68
So somebody who's a little bit more extreme might be,

2858
01:55:38.12 --> 01:55:40.76
like OCD might be, say germs, right?

2859
01:55:40.76 --> 01:55:44.72
So they don't, I don't want to touch doorknobs, shake hands,

2860
01:55:44.72 --> 01:55:46.32
use public restrooms.

2861
01:55:47.48 --> 01:55:49.80
How they fare during COVID?

2862
01:55:49.80 --> 01:55:51.44
They loved it.

2863
01:55:51.44 --> 01:55:52.88
Oh, cause they just like, oh.

2864
01:55:52.88 --> 01:55:54.80
Social distancing, I don't have to touch anybody.

2865
01:55:54.80 --> 01:55:57.08
And you have to wear a mask in front of me.

2866
01:55:57.08 --> 01:55:57.92
Sure.

2867
01:55:57.92 --> 01:55:58.76
Yeah.

2868
01:55:58.76 --> 01:55:59.60
Love.

2869
01:55:59.60 --> 01:56:00.44
They were stoked.

2870
01:56:00.44 --> 01:56:03.88
Those are the ones that are going to have a lot harder time,

2871
01:56:03.88 --> 01:56:07.40
socially engaging, taking risks, right?

2872
01:56:07.40 --> 01:56:10.60
Like the idea of like, well, the only restroom here

2873
01:56:10.60 --> 01:56:14.52
is a public room and you gotta go in there or hold it.

2874
01:56:14.52 --> 01:56:16.88
Like, you know, that's going to be very distressing

2875
01:56:16.88 --> 01:56:19.40
for somebody that leans a little bit more.

2876
01:56:19.40 --> 01:56:23.32
Towards obsessions and compulsions.

2877
01:56:23.32 --> 01:56:27.36
What do COVID look like?

2878
01:56:27.36 --> 01:56:30.64
Cause I've done a couple of podcasts about deaths of despair

2879
01:56:30.64 --> 01:56:31.48
during COVID.

2880
01:56:31.48 --> 01:56:36.48
It's a nightmare from your professional perspective.

2881
01:56:36.68 --> 01:56:37.92
How bad was it?

2882
01:56:37.92 --> 01:56:38.76
Oh my gosh.

2883
01:56:38.76 --> 01:56:41.28
I mean, it was significant because I mean, already,

2884
01:56:41.28 --> 01:56:43.52
especially when you're working with very complex psychiatric

2885
01:56:43.52 --> 01:56:46.52
disorders, resources and like access to hospitals and such

2886
01:56:46.52 --> 01:56:49.28
is always sort of an issue for our folks.

2887
01:56:49.28 --> 01:56:53.52
Because, you know, there is certain criteria related to being

2888
01:56:53.52 --> 01:56:54.80
able to get hospital support.

2889
01:56:54.80 --> 01:56:58.12
Somebody has to be very sort of significantly regressed to be

2890
01:56:58.12 --> 01:57:00.32
able to get hospital support if they need that.

2891
01:57:00.32 --> 01:57:03.64
And there oftentimes isn't that level of care that allows for

2892
01:57:03.64 --> 01:57:06.76
that like sort of least restrictive setting in order to

2893
01:57:06.76 --> 01:57:09.60
be able to support them outside of the hospital.

2894
01:57:09.60 --> 01:57:12.56
So that means that in order for me to go and get help,

2895
01:57:12.56 --> 01:57:14.64
I needed to be in really bad shape,

2896
01:57:14.64 --> 01:57:16.52
which means I'm in really bad shape.

2897
01:57:16.52 --> 01:57:19.08
Well, and that's in general for folks with mental health

2898
01:57:19.08 --> 01:57:20.24
and mental health problems.

2899
01:57:20.24 --> 01:57:22.28
You need to be a danger to yourself or others and meet

2900
01:57:22.28 --> 01:57:24.52
criteria like significantly be a danger to yourself or others

2901
01:57:24.52 --> 01:57:25.76
to be able to get that, you know,

2902
01:57:25.76 --> 01:57:28.000
kind of inpatient hospitalization unless you're willing

2903
01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.96
to go on your own, which oftentimes when someone is

2904
01:57:29.96 --> 01:57:32.64
in that state they might not be.

2905
01:57:32.64 --> 01:57:35.36
So then with COVID, obviously access to resources and beds

2906
01:57:35.36 --> 01:57:38.000
became significantly less than you have a significant more

2907
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.96
isolation, which is a huge risk factor for our folks.

2908
01:57:41.96 --> 01:57:45.000
Isolation undoubtedly will increase, you know,

2909
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.08
symptoms of psychosis, depression, anxiety,

2910
01:57:48.08 --> 01:57:50.72
you know, when I go inside my head and I have this internal

2911
01:57:50.72 --> 01:57:52.76
side of isolation, a lot can happen.

2912
01:57:52.76 --> 01:57:54.48
And so just being in contact with other people,

2913
01:57:54.48 --> 01:57:56.16
making eye contact with you, these things,

2914
01:57:56.16 --> 01:57:57.72
they're like grounding to the person.

2915
01:57:57.72 --> 01:57:59.16
So all of that is impacted.

2916
01:57:59.16 --> 01:58:02.40
And then how we had to do therapy shifted significantly.

2917
01:58:02.40 --> 01:58:04.36
I mean, we moved from a residential setting where we're

2918
01:58:04.36 --> 01:58:06.56
seeing people in person, we're going to outings together,

2919
01:58:06.56 --> 01:58:08.48
we're meeting in groups together to like,

2920
01:58:08.48 --> 01:58:12.48
now I'm doing over the computer with you with somebody who

2921
01:58:12.48 --> 01:58:14.72
may have some significant psychosis around computer use.

2922
01:58:14.72 --> 01:58:17.32
So they're not even going to get on the camera with you.

2923
01:58:17.32 --> 01:58:20.36
So it just really impacted our ability to provide care

2924
01:58:20.36 --> 01:58:20.92
during that time.

2925
01:58:20.92 --> 01:58:23.44
And people responded, I think, you know,

2926
01:58:23.44 --> 01:58:26.12
I can't speak for all settings, but, you know,

2927
01:58:26.12 --> 01:58:28.96
as best as they could during that time to be able to provide

2928
01:58:28.96 --> 01:58:31.52
services and such and maintain the level of services

2929
01:58:31.52 --> 01:58:33.80
that people needed.

2930
01:58:33.80 --> 01:58:37.08
It was definitely a really difficult time.

2931
01:58:37.08 --> 01:58:39.88
And, you know, telehealth is a super great option.

2932
01:58:39.88 --> 01:58:43.52
It's not the best option for every client, you know,

2933
01:58:43.52 --> 01:58:46.72
that in person is so important.

2934
01:58:46.72 --> 01:58:49.64
And a lot of times for our folks, because a lot of talk therapy

2935
01:58:49.64 --> 01:58:50.60
is very cognitive.

2936
01:58:50.60 --> 01:58:52.60
And if you're working with someone with a cognitive disorder

2937
01:58:52.60 --> 01:58:54.84
or a thought disorder, you know, oftentimes your sessions

2938
01:58:54.84 --> 01:58:59.52
look like going for a walk or baking a pie together

2939
01:58:59.52 --> 01:59:02.48
or like something of that nature that really we couldn't do

2940
01:59:02.48 --> 01:59:03.52
so much during that time.

2941
01:59:03.52 --> 01:59:06.32
Or if we did, it was, you know, an increased risk

2942
01:59:06.32 --> 01:59:08.20
to the person and their health, especially during the time

2943
01:59:08.20 --> 01:59:10.64
of COVID where we didn't really know too much about, right,

2944
01:59:10.64 --> 01:59:12.76
what was happening and all these regulations came in.

2945
01:59:12.76 --> 01:59:14.44
And like, you had to have all this distance

2946
01:59:14.44 --> 01:59:17.60
that couldn't do these things.

2947
01:59:17.60 --> 01:59:20.24
It impacted a lot.

2948
01:59:20.24 --> 01:59:26.72
And I think also seeing, especially for people who are,

2949
01:59:26.72 --> 01:59:29.76
seemed like in that age range, like maybe middle school going

2950
01:59:29.76 --> 01:59:32.12
into high school, like right somewhere in there

2951
01:59:32.12 --> 01:59:34.20
where a lot of social things are happening.

2952
01:59:34.20 --> 01:59:36.52
Like your life is kind of socially driven,

2953
01:59:36.52 --> 01:59:37.96
your friends, access to your friends,

2954
01:59:37.96 --> 01:59:40.24
what everybody else is doing, you're growing up,

2955
01:59:40.24 --> 01:59:42.56
maybe starting to think about college, things like that.

2956
01:59:42.56 --> 01:59:45.36
Where there was this instant, you know, kind of a halt.

2957
01:59:45.36 --> 01:59:47.44
And people were not going to school

2958
01:59:47.44 --> 01:59:48.96
and having to do their classes online

2959
01:59:48.96 --> 01:59:50.000
and not seeing their friends.

2960
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.36
So I saw a lot, especially in the younger population,

2961
01:59:54.36 --> 01:59:59.08
almost like an arrested development of social development.

2962
01:59:59.08 --> 02:00:03.16
So now, like, yeah, my clients who are 2021, 22,

2963
02:00:03.16 --> 02:00:04.68
but you're talking to them and you're like, wow,

2964
02:00:04.68 --> 02:00:07.72
you really sound like 16 or 17 years old right now.

2965
02:00:07.72 --> 02:00:11.64
Like they kind of stalled out in the natural progression.

2966
02:00:11.64 --> 02:00:14.40
I mean, my niece and my nephew,

2967
02:00:14.40 --> 02:00:17.16
one was graduating college and one was graduating high school

2968
02:00:17.16 --> 02:00:20.60
right when COVID happened, so like that May or whatever.

2969
02:00:20.60 --> 02:00:25.04
So like, no graduations, no, you know,

2970
02:00:25.04 --> 02:00:29.08
the pump in circumstance that comes with these milestones

2971
02:00:29.08 --> 02:00:32.32
and rites of passage in life, they didn't have those.

2972
02:00:33.60 --> 02:00:36.44
They seemed to fare okay, but I think about all the folks

2973
02:00:36.44 --> 02:00:39.12
that like, well, what did that mean for their lives

2974
02:00:39.12 --> 02:00:43.28
or the sense of missing out on something important

2975
02:00:43.28 --> 02:00:45.12
and not having had the same opportunities.

2976
02:00:45.12 --> 02:00:47.84
And I saw a lot of anxiety,

2977
02:00:47.84 --> 02:00:51.72
a lot of anxiety, depression, isolation, fear,

2978
02:00:51.72 --> 02:00:52.72
so much fear.

2979
02:00:52.72 --> 02:00:54.44
I actually was on a podcast a couple of weeks ago

2980
02:00:54.44 --> 02:00:58.16
where we were talking about how people,

2981
02:00:58.16 --> 02:01:00.32
like remember when we were able,

2982
02:01:00.32 --> 02:01:01.92
like going to the grocery store,

2983
02:01:01.92 --> 02:01:03.68
like, you know, everyone's like head down

2984
02:01:03.68 --> 02:01:05.32
and you're like not looking at anybody

2985
02:01:05.32 --> 02:01:06.72
and don't get too close to a car.

2986
02:01:06.72 --> 02:01:07.56
Stop making eye contact.

2987
02:01:07.56 --> 02:01:08.92
Like it was very like weird.

2988
02:01:08.92 --> 02:01:11.52
And this like that stayed.

2989
02:01:11.52 --> 02:01:13.28
Like the people weren't like, oh, hey, how's it going?

2990
02:01:13.28 --> 02:01:14.84
Nice to see you haven't seen me in a couple months

2991
02:01:14.84 --> 02:01:15.68
and give you a hug.

2992
02:01:15.68 --> 02:01:16.52
And some people were.

2993
02:01:16.52 --> 02:01:17.52
I was like that for about three days.

2994
02:01:17.52 --> 02:01:18.36
Yeah.

2995
02:01:18.36 --> 02:01:20.12
And I'm like, I'm going to the store.

2996
02:01:20.12 --> 02:01:21.44
Yeah, just get back to me.

2997
02:01:21.44 --> 02:01:22.96
But it is still like that.

2998
02:01:22.96 --> 02:01:24.88
I mean, some of that is still happening.

2999
02:01:24.88 --> 02:01:26.52
So the fear, so when, again,

3000
02:01:26.52 --> 02:01:28.12
going back to that nervous system thing, right?

3001
02:01:28.12 --> 02:01:30.16
So if people's fear is up here

3002
02:01:30.16 --> 02:01:32.76
and I'm constantly on alert and watching and waiting

3003
02:01:32.76 --> 02:01:35.04
and who's wearing their mask and who isn't wearing your,

3004
02:01:35.04 --> 02:01:37.32
not on the dot in the grocery store.

3005
02:01:37.32 --> 02:01:40.12
Like people are not using their brains.

3006
02:01:40.12 --> 02:01:42.16
Like they're not using the part of the brain

3007
02:01:42.16 --> 02:01:43.52
that can be like, okay, it's chill.

3008
02:01:43.52 --> 02:01:44.36
It's cool.

3009
02:01:44.36 --> 02:01:45.20
We're fine.

3010
02:01:45.20 --> 02:01:46.04
We're good.

3011
02:01:46.04 --> 02:01:47.52
Cause you're keyed up all the time.

3012
02:01:47.52 --> 02:01:48.96
I think that is still happening.

3013
02:01:48.96 --> 02:01:50.64
We have not seen the end of the effect of that.

3014
02:01:50.64 --> 02:01:53.36
Well, and those who had a propensity towards anxiety

3015
02:01:53.36 --> 02:01:55.28
prior were struggling through some of that.

3016
02:01:55.28 --> 02:01:57.16
I mean, significant more damage.

3017
02:01:57.16 --> 02:01:59.32
And then you saw it happen when there was the decision

3018
02:01:59.32 --> 02:02:01.04
of could we take the masks on or off

3019
02:02:01.04 --> 02:02:02.44
and those who chose to keep it on

3020
02:02:02.44 --> 02:02:03.48
and those who didn't, you know,

3021
02:02:03.48 --> 02:02:05.08
it was very interesting when you would listen

3022
02:02:05.08 --> 02:02:06.36
to folks perspective on that.

3023
02:02:06.36 --> 02:02:09.000
But oftentimes it felt, especially for some

3024
02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.60
of the younger kids, like protective

3025
02:02:10.60 --> 02:02:12.80
to have that over the face in some ways.

3026
02:02:14.08 --> 02:02:15.40
Very interesting impact.

3027
02:02:16.80 --> 02:02:19.52
Man, that's crazy.

3028
02:02:19.52 --> 02:02:21.32
What about addiction?

3029
02:02:21.32 --> 02:02:24.44
And it's funny cause like you can get addicted

3030
02:02:24.44 --> 02:02:26.52
to anything apparently, right?

3031
02:02:26.52 --> 02:02:27.76
Like people get addicted to anything,

3032
02:02:27.76 --> 02:02:31.68
but alcohol, opioids, cocaine, amphetamines,

3033
02:02:31.68 --> 02:02:36.68
hallucinogens, PCP, like people, it's crazy.

3034
02:02:39.08 --> 02:02:40.76
Anything in every, TikTok.

3035
02:02:40.76 --> 02:02:41.60
TikTok.

3036
02:02:46.20 --> 02:02:48.60
Let's jump to PTSD.

3037
02:02:48.60 --> 02:02:51.16
So, you know, obviously in the veteran community,

3038
02:02:51.16 --> 02:02:55.24
PTSD has been a huge news story

3039
02:02:55.24 --> 02:02:58.80
and it's had a really big impact on, you know,

3040
02:02:58.80 --> 02:03:03.80
on a lot of people. Sometimes I think, well,

3041
02:03:03.80 --> 02:03:06.16
some people could actually use that kick

3042
02:03:06.16 --> 02:03:07.44
in the ass that I talked about earlier.

3043
02:03:07.44 --> 02:03:10.48
Like, hey dude, yeah, you saw some bad stuff,

3044
02:03:10.48 --> 02:03:13.20
you lost some friends, but it's time to move on.

3045
02:03:14.60 --> 02:03:18.40
And I think some people need that sort of direction.

3046
02:03:19.28 --> 02:03:21.04
I mean, look, we've been going to wars

3047
02:03:21.04 --> 02:03:22.96
since the beginning of mankind.

3048
02:03:22.96 --> 02:03:26.36
I mean, and you know, you look at the other wars

3049
02:03:26.36 --> 02:03:29.04
that we've been through in America, World War I,

3050
02:03:29.04 --> 02:03:30.40
World War II, Korea, Vietnam,

3051
02:03:30.40 --> 02:03:34.92
these were incredibly horrific wars, as all wars are.

3052
02:03:37.16 --> 02:03:41.28
When you guys look at PTSD,

3053
02:03:41.28 --> 02:03:46.28
what do you think from like a national perspective

3054
02:03:46.92 --> 02:03:50.48
of where it's at, how it's being handled,

3055
02:03:50.48 --> 02:03:52.40
do you think it's being handled the right way?

3056
02:03:52.40 --> 02:03:53.56
What could we do better?

3057
02:03:53.56 --> 02:03:57.000
I mean, you were out there freaking with a,

3058
02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.84
in a fox hole with a pistol and a scorpion.

3059
02:03:59.84 --> 02:04:03.04
You're scarred from that.

3060
02:04:03.04 --> 02:04:05.20
I should write a book, that's the book title right there.

3061
02:04:05.20 --> 02:04:09.28
I mean, I'm definitely not a public health expert.

3062
02:04:09.28 --> 02:04:12.68
I don't have the national kind of response to some of this.

3063
02:04:12.68 --> 02:04:14.72
I mean, what I'll say in my private practice,

3064
02:04:14.72 --> 02:04:19.16
specifically to veterans is that whether sort of real

3065
02:04:19.16 --> 02:04:21.72
or imagined, the military armed forces in general

3066
02:04:21.72 --> 02:04:25.76
is doing a lot to try to address providing resources,

3067
02:04:25.76 --> 02:04:29.80
early intervention, when traumatic events occur,

3068
02:04:29.80 --> 02:04:31.40
having people on site who are trained

3069
02:04:31.40 --> 02:04:32.48
to be able to help support.

3070
02:04:32.48 --> 02:04:34.52
I mean, there's a lot that's happening.

3071
02:04:34.52 --> 02:04:38.40
But stigma, the notion of stigma is still very present

3072
02:04:38.40 --> 02:04:41.52
with regard to what it means to have mental health issues.

3073
02:04:41.52 --> 02:04:44.60
And so I often have both active duty and veterans find me

3074
02:04:44.60 --> 02:04:49.000
in my private practice, knowing that I was previous military,

3075
02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.92
I think they feel a draw to me in that way

3076
02:04:50.92 --> 02:04:52.96
in that history that I'm a safe person.

3077
02:04:52.96 --> 02:04:57.20
Coming to me, because it doesn't, in that environment,

3078
02:04:57.20 --> 02:05:00.52
feel safe just yet to be able to talk openly

3079
02:05:00.52 --> 02:05:02.76
about what's going on for me.

3080
02:05:02.76 --> 02:05:06.48
Because of, I mean, I think there's two really primary themes

3081
02:05:06.48 --> 02:05:08.52
which look like privacy.

3082
02:05:08.52 --> 02:05:11.72
Like will what I have to share stay private to me?

3083
02:05:11.72 --> 02:05:14.64
Or if I talk about this, will my medical officer then know?

3084
02:05:14.64 --> 02:05:15.96
And now my CO knows.

3085
02:05:15.96 --> 02:05:17.56
And now if somebody's having a talk with me

3086
02:05:17.56 --> 02:05:22.88
about something I shared, or this notion of retaliation

3087
02:05:22.88 --> 02:05:25.52
in some ways, because somebody heard a story from somebody

3088
02:05:25.52 --> 02:05:27.56
that they told someone they had depression,

3089
02:05:27.56 --> 02:05:29.88
they were put on antidepressant, and now they took my wings,

3090
02:05:29.88 --> 02:05:31.24
which is like my whole identity.

3091
02:05:31.24 --> 02:05:33.12
So whether these things are actually happening,

3092
02:05:33.12 --> 02:05:36.76
it's still very much so part of the culture or suggestion

3093
02:05:36.76 --> 02:05:39.60
of like, is it safe to talk about these things?

3094
02:05:39.60 --> 02:05:43.52
And so I think from that perspective,

3095
02:05:43.52 --> 02:05:45.76
in terms of what we can do is it's

3096
02:05:45.76 --> 02:05:48.28
amazing all of the resources that

3097
02:05:48.28 --> 02:05:49.96
are being created and opportunities.

3098
02:05:49.96 --> 02:05:51.44
I just recently read about like it's

3099
02:05:51.44 --> 02:05:52.88
referred to as the sprint team.

3100
02:05:52.88 --> 02:05:53.72
But it's essential.

3101
02:05:53.72 --> 02:05:56.88
It's a special psychiatric unit as part of the armed forces

3102
02:05:56.88 --> 02:05:59.44
where they come on site in response to like a trauma or something.

3103
02:05:59.44 --> 02:06:00.20
It's very awesome.

3104
02:06:00.20 --> 02:06:02.64
But engagement in the resources is still

3105
02:06:02.64 --> 02:06:05.40
a really important factor, especially for veterans who

3106
02:06:05.40 --> 02:06:08.72
disengage from like use of VHA services or anything

3107
02:06:08.72 --> 02:06:09.24
like that.

3108
02:06:09.24 --> 02:06:11.52
So like getting people to engage.

3109
02:06:11.52 --> 02:06:14.68
And like, what we know about engagement in general

3110
02:06:14.68 --> 02:06:17.76
is that like that initial response to someone's willingness,

3111
02:06:17.76 --> 02:06:20.68
and we talked about this earlier, to disclose or talk

3112
02:06:20.68 --> 02:06:23.20
about what's going on for them is critical,

3113
02:06:23.20 --> 02:06:24.72
because it's going to shape whether or not

3114
02:06:24.72 --> 02:06:27.72
they feel they can do that.

3115
02:06:27.72 --> 02:06:29.80
And so I think engagement is huge,

3116
02:06:29.80 --> 02:06:31.56
both in the active duty and veteran realm.

3117
02:06:31.56 --> 02:06:33.000
And what we see with a lot of veterans

3118
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.000
and why they usually end up finding me in private practice,

3119
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.52
not part of their insurance or anything like that,

3120
02:06:38.52 --> 02:06:39.80
is the privacy factor.

3121
02:06:39.80 --> 02:06:44.12
But also, when you're separating from the military,

3122
02:06:44.12 --> 02:06:47.20
part of your access to resources and disability

3123
02:06:47.20 --> 02:06:49.000
and these sorts of things is directly connected

3124
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.08
to your service record, what was disclosed

3125
02:06:51.08 --> 02:06:52.40
while you were in the military.

3126
02:06:52.40 --> 02:06:56.44
And so if I'm in a culture, real or imagined, or in my mind,

3127
02:06:56.44 --> 02:06:58.32
I feel like this is not a place where

3128
02:06:58.32 --> 02:06:59.80
I can talk about these things.

3129
02:06:59.80 --> 02:07:00.84
So I've chosen not to.

3130
02:07:00.84 --> 02:07:01.92
I sort of white knuckle did.

3131
02:07:01.92 --> 02:07:02.56
I've gotten through.

3132
02:07:02.56 --> 02:07:03.64
I haven't shared a whole lot.

3133
02:07:03.64 --> 02:07:06.48
Here I am as a veteran, looking towards trying

3134
02:07:06.48 --> 02:07:08.36
to get some services or disability,

3135
02:07:08.36 --> 02:07:10.64
or maybe now I'm realizing I'm no longer

3136
02:07:10.64 --> 02:07:13.72
in the structure of that military environment.

3137
02:07:13.72 --> 02:07:15.76
And so all this stuff is coming up for me

3138
02:07:15.76 --> 02:07:17.92
that may be the structure of that environment sort of kept

3139
02:07:17.92 --> 02:07:19.08
at bay.

3140
02:07:19.08 --> 02:07:21.88
And I'm being told, well, there's nothing here

3141
02:07:21.88 --> 02:07:24.92
to suggest in your record that anything significant happened

3142
02:07:24.92 --> 02:07:25.44
to you.

3143
02:07:25.44 --> 02:07:28.72
So you have to kind of convince me in some ways

3144
02:07:28.72 --> 02:07:31.64
as to why you should get this disability percentage

3145
02:07:31.64 --> 02:07:33.16
or why you should be treated for these.

3146
02:07:33.16 --> 02:07:35.96
And the way it's looked at is based on PTSD,

3147
02:07:35.96 --> 02:07:39.68
or everything is broken down in parts.

3148
02:07:39.68 --> 02:07:40.72
Your back is one part.

3149
02:07:40.72 --> 02:07:42.80
Your PTSD, your mental health is one part.

3150
02:07:42.80 --> 02:07:44.36
Your arm is one part of that.

3151
02:07:44.36 --> 02:07:46.56
And they're all looked at differently in that way.

3152
02:07:46.56 --> 02:07:47.92
And so it puts a veteran in a position

3153
02:07:47.92 --> 02:07:51.56
where they have to sort of now prove in some ways

3154
02:07:51.56 --> 02:07:53.72
that they are deserving of this disability.

3155
02:07:53.72 --> 02:07:55.52
It can be very retraumatizing for someone

3156
02:07:55.52 --> 02:07:57.72
who's maybe never shared about something that happened

3157
02:07:57.72 --> 02:08:00.64
in the sexual assault or something that happened to me

3158
02:08:00.64 --> 02:08:02.80
while I was deployed or something that's sort of embarrassing,

3159
02:08:02.80 --> 02:08:04.68
or I hold a lot of shame about because I haven't really

3160
02:08:04.68 --> 02:08:06.48
dealt with now I'm in this position where I have to sort

3161
02:08:06.48 --> 02:08:07.88
of recount all this.

3162
02:08:07.88 --> 02:08:10.96
I have to get these character references for these things

3163
02:08:10.96 --> 02:08:13.52
that happen to sort of prove that I'm worthy of this disability,

3164
02:08:13.52 --> 02:08:16.88
which then opens me up to these resources in some ways.

3165
02:08:16.88 --> 02:08:22.84
And so that part, what we can do sort of like as a leader

3166
02:08:22.84 --> 02:08:24.96
in an initial response to somebody,

3167
02:08:24.96 --> 02:08:27.44
say they're coming to tell us something that's going on,

3168
02:08:27.44 --> 02:08:29.72
how we react in that moment is huge because it's

3169
02:08:29.72 --> 02:08:31.32
going to set the precedent for whether or not

3170
02:08:31.32 --> 02:08:34.60
that person is going to reengage should something be going on

3171
02:08:34.60 --> 02:08:36.84
for them or if it's a safe place to talk about the things that

3172
02:08:36.84 --> 02:08:37.40
are going on.

3173
02:08:37.40 --> 02:08:39.56
So to answer your question a long way around,

3174
02:08:39.56 --> 02:08:41.44
I don't know about nationally what

3175
02:08:41.44 --> 02:08:43.04
we're doing if it's the right thing to do,

3176
02:08:43.04 --> 02:08:45.68
but I do know engagement and all of the resources

3177
02:08:45.68 --> 02:08:48.64
that are being put out there is still an issue.

3178
02:08:48.64 --> 02:08:52.60
And I read something from the Navy,

3179
02:08:52.60 --> 02:08:55.80
like it was like a 2021 study around veteran suicide rates

3180
02:08:55.80 --> 02:08:57.04
and all of these different things.

3181
02:08:57.04 --> 02:08:59.76
And the suicide rate daily for those individuals

3182
02:08:59.76 --> 02:09:04.80
who were engaged with the BHA was less than those who were not.

3183
02:09:04.80 --> 02:09:08.76
So engagement is a really important factor

3184
02:09:08.76 --> 02:09:10.16
in how do we keep people doing that.

3185
02:09:10.16 --> 02:09:12.36
Well, I think making sure that we understand

3186
02:09:12.36 --> 02:09:15.32
how important privacy is to someone

3187
02:09:15.32 --> 02:09:17.80
who's dealing with something like this

3188
02:09:17.80 --> 02:09:20.76
and the fear of retaliation.

3189
02:09:20.76 --> 02:09:22.76
Like, will you take something that's important to me?

3190
02:09:22.76 --> 02:09:23.64
Will you take my wings?

3191
02:09:23.64 --> 02:09:27.56
Like, will you know that these are people's full identity?

3192
02:09:27.56 --> 02:09:31.80
Will I lose my status by spot as part of this group

3193
02:09:31.80 --> 02:09:34.36
that I've been so connected to?

3194
02:09:34.36 --> 02:09:36.08
I see this a lot in folks coming through

3195
02:09:36.08 --> 02:09:39.72
and special operations or things like that.

3196
02:09:39.72 --> 02:09:42.60
Like, they're more likely to seek services,

3197
02:09:42.60 --> 02:09:46.88
in my experience, outside of the military,

3198
02:09:46.88 --> 02:09:48.72
out of fear of those two things.

3199
02:09:48.72 --> 02:09:49.80
Yeah.

3200
02:09:49.80 --> 02:09:50.64
I got...

3201
02:09:52.36 --> 02:09:55.28
I being aware of what's going on in the world

3202
02:09:55.28 --> 02:09:57.52
is such an advantage.

3203
02:09:57.52 --> 02:10:01.76
And my basic example of that is if you came to my house

3204
02:10:01.76 --> 02:10:04.64
and I said, hey, I'm gonna scare you

3205
02:10:04.64 --> 02:10:06.16
when you walk down the hallway.

3206
02:10:06.16 --> 02:10:07.08
And then you walk down the hallway

3207
02:10:07.08 --> 02:10:09.08
and I jumped out and said, boo, you wouldn't be scared at all.

3208
02:10:09.08 --> 02:10:11.24
If I didn't tell you that

3209
02:10:11.24 --> 02:10:12.64
and you came walking down my house

3210
02:10:12.64 --> 02:10:15.64
and I jumped out of the doorway and screamed at you,

3211
02:10:15.64 --> 02:10:17.68
you'd be scared, because that's what would happen.

3212
02:10:17.68 --> 02:10:19.20
So being aware of what's going on

3213
02:10:19.20 --> 02:10:20.84
just makes you so much more prepared for it.

3214
02:10:20.84 --> 02:10:25.84
So I realized, working with fighters and being in combat,

3215
02:10:27.12 --> 02:10:30.32
you'd see like a new guy that was on his first deployment

3216
02:10:30.32 --> 02:10:32.04
and you'd see him before an operation

3217
02:10:32.04 --> 02:10:35.08
and you'd see he's really nervous.

3218
02:10:35.08 --> 02:10:38.36
And maybe feels like a little bit sick to his stomach.

3219
02:10:38.36 --> 02:10:40.68
He's gone to the bathroom four times in the last 20 minutes

3220
02:10:40.68 --> 02:10:42.68
and you're like, oh yeah, he's got a little bit of that,

3221
02:10:42.68 --> 02:10:44.28
a little bit of those nerves going.

3222
02:10:44.28 --> 02:10:46.84
And you say something to him like, hey man,

3223
02:10:46.84 --> 02:10:48.32
that's the fourth time you go to the bathroom.

3224
02:10:48.32 --> 02:10:49.16
Are you all right?

3225
02:10:49.16 --> 02:10:50.000
They're like, I'm fine.

3226
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.12
And you're like, hey, dude, it's fine.

3227
02:10:51.12 --> 02:10:54.000
Like you're nervous, you might get killed.

3228
02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.16
It's no big deal to be a little bit nervous.

3229
02:10:56.16 --> 02:10:57.20
And I go, oh, okay.

3230
02:10:58.32 --> 02:10:59.52
Okay, it's okay.

3231
02:10:59.52 --> 02:11:00.52
It's okay that you're nervous.

3232
02:11:00.52 --> 02:11:01.44
You should be nervous.

3233
02:11:01.44 --> 02:11:03.16
If you're not nervous, there's something wrong with you.

3234
02:11:03.16 --> 02:11:05.84
And then, so I took that and I actually used it

3235
02:11:05.84 --> 02:11:08.44
when I was training mixed martial arts fighters

3236
02:11:08.44 --> 02:11:10.28
because the same thing would happen.

3237
02:11:10.28 --> 02:11:13.80
They'd be going the night of the UFC

3238
02:11:13.80 --> 02:11:15.88
or a few hours before they're all nervous.

3239
02:11:15.88 --> 02:11:17.80
You could see that they're nervous,

3240
02:11:17.80 --> 02:11:18.84
but they don't know what it is.

3241
02:11:18.84 --> 02:11:20.000
They don't know why they feel sick.

3242
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.36
So they think there's something wrong with them.

3243
02:11:21.36 --> 02:11:23.28
So now they're freaking out.

3244
02:11:23.28 --> 02:11:25.16
So you go, oh, hey, you just went to the bathroom

3245
02:11:25.16 --> 02:11:27.52
for the ninth time in the last half an hour.

3246
02:11:27.52 --> 02:11:29.44
You're feeling a little nervous and they go,

3247
02:11:29.44 --> 02:11:30.92
no, I don't know what's wrong with me.

3248
02:11:30.92 --> 02:11:31.92
Hey, what's wrong with you

3249
02:11:31.92 --> 02:11:33.44
is you're getting ready to go into combat.

3250
02:11:33.44 --> 02:11:34.96
You're getting ready to take some chances.

3251
02:11:34.96 --> 02:11:37.36
And that's your body getting ready,

3252
02:11:37.36 --> 02:11:39.40
getting rid of all the stuff it doesn't need right now

3253
02:11:39.40 --> 02:11:40.56
so it can focus on fighting.

3254
02:11:40.56 --> 02:11:42.000
This is good.

3255
02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.08
And they think, oh, okay.

3256
02:11:44.08 --> 02:11:45.40
So that's what normal is.

3257
02:11:45.40 --> 02:11:47.20
It's okay to feel like that.

3258
02:11:47.20 --> 02:11:50.16
I had a guy on my podcast named Tom Fife

3259
02:11:50.16 --> 02:11:52.52
who was in World War II Korea in Vietnam

3260
02:11:52.52 --> 02:11:55.64
and he got a purple heart in World War II Korea in Vietnam.

3261
02:11:56.48 --> 02:11:58.24
And I was asking him,

3262
02:11:58.24 --> 02:12:00.44
he was a battalion commander in Vietnam.

3263
02:12:00.44 --> 02:12:03.64
And so this was, it had been 55 or 60 years

3264
02:12:03.64 --> 02:12:04.96
since he was in Vietnam.

3265
02:12:05.92 --> 02:12:09.76
And I was asking him about what type of operations

3266
02:12:09.76 --> 02:12:11.24
they were doing and then I started asking him

3267
02:12:11.24 --> 02:12:15.36
about what kind of casualties he took in his battalion.

3268
02:12:16.36 --> 02:12:19.48
And as he started to address that,

3269
02:12:19.48 --> 02:12:22.84
he started getting choked up talking about it.

3270
02:12:23.72 --> 02:12:25.84
And I remember I'm sitting there thinking

3271
02:12:25.84 --> 02:12:28.12
it's been 60 years for this guy

3272
02:12:28.12 --> 02:12:30.16
and he was a battalion commander and he lost guys

3273
02:12:30.16 --> 02:12:32.12
and he still gets choked up about it.

3274
02:12:32.12 --> 02:12:34.12
And because that'll happen to me.

3275
02:12:34.12 --> 02:12:35.48
I'll be talking to someone about some of the guys

3276
02:12:35.48 --> 02:12:37.24
that I lost and I'll get choked up.

3277
02:12:37.24 --> 02:12:39.60
And I said to myself, oh, this is just the way it is.

3278
02:12:39.60 --> 02:12:42.76
And it's normal and it's okay.

3279
02:12:42.76 --> 02:12:47.36
And I think that's a huge part that we missed out on

3280
02:12:47.36 --> 02:12:50.56
and that we have missed out on is someone going,

3281
02:12:50.56 --> 02:12:55.56
oh, I'm sad, there must be something wrong with me.

3282
02:12:55.84 --> 02:12:58.60
And it's like, no, you're sad, you lost your friend.

3283
02:12:58.60 --> 02:13:00.12
And you lost your friend and now you feel sad

3284
02:13:00.12 --> 02:13:02.60
and that's what you're gonna feel like.

3285
02:13:02.60 --> 02:13:04.80
And over time it'll dissipate a little bit

3286
02:13:04.80 --> 02:13:05.88
and then it might come back.

3287
02:13:05.88 --> 02:13:09.76
You know, it's another thing that I talked about.

3288
02:13:09.76 --> 02:13:11.72
I talked about losing people and what you go through

3289
02:13:11.72 --> 02:13:16.56
and what, and I went through this big dramatic description

3290
02:13:16.56 --> 02:13:19.88
of being caught in a storm.

3291
02:13:19.88 --> 02:13:23.60
And when you lose someone, when one of your friends dies,

3292
02:13:23.60 --> 02:13:26.96
you're gonna be hit with emotions that you can't control.

3293
02:13:26.96 --> 02:13:29.24
And we as adults, we're not used to not being able

3294
02:13:29.24 --> 02:13:31.12
to control emotions anymore.

3295
02:13:31.12 --> 02:13:33.20
That happens when you're five years old.

3296
02:13:33.20 --> 02:13:35.12
It shouldn't happen when I'm 40.

3297
02:13:35.12 --> 02:13:37.68
So my friend dies, all of a sudden I get hit

3298
02:13:37.68 --> 02:13:39.84
with these emotions, I'm not in control anymore

3299
02:13:39.84 --> 02:13:41.000
and I don't like that feeling

3300
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:42.60
and I think there must be something wrong with me.

3301
02:13:42.60 --> 02:13:45.000
It's like, no, actually, this is what's normal.

3302
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.92
You're gonna get hit with these emotions, but guess what?

3303
02:13:46.92 --> 02:13:51.56
Eventually those waves of emotions will go away

3304
02:13:51.56 --> 02:13:52.98
and you'll have a break.

3305
02:13:54.36 --> 02:13:56.16
Okay, so then you think, okay, well then I'm fine.

3306
02:13:56.16 --> 02:13:57.88
But then you get hit randomly.

3307
02:13:57.88 --> 02:13:59.36
You see something, you hear a song,

3308
02:13:59.36 --> 02:14:01.64
you smell something, you drive by whatever restaurant

3309
02:14:01.64 --> 02:14:03.76
and you get hit with that emotion again.

3310
02:14:03.76 --> 02:14:06.88
You don't notice this, but it's not quite as strong.

3311
02:14:06.88 --> 02:14:08.72
And there's been a little space and over time,

3312
02:14:08.72 --> 02:14:13.56
the strength of the emotional waves starts to lessen.

3313
02:14:13.56 --> 02:14:15.56
And this is what I learned this for myself

3314
02:14:15.56 --> 02:14:18.12
because I experienced it a bunch of times.

3315
02:14:18.12 --> 02:14:20.88
And by the sixth or seventh or eighth time,

3316
02:14:20.88 --> 02:14:22.32
I was saying, oh yeah, this is that emotion

3317
02:14:22.32 --> 02:14:23.40
that I'm gonna feel right now

3318
02:14:23.40 --> 02:14:24.80
and I don't can't control it

3319
02:14:24.80 --> 02:14:26.48
and I'm gonna sit here and cry

3320
02:14:26.48 --> 02:14:28.96
and then I'm gonna stop and then 20 minutes later

3321
02:14:28.96 --> 02:14:31.32
I'm gonna be laughing and that'll seem fine.

3322
02:14:31.32 --> 02:14:33.48
It'll seem like I'm okay, but then a week later

3323
02:14:33.48 --> 02:14:35.96
I'll get hit with this other emotion again with a sadness

3324
02:14:35.96 --> 02:14:38.80
and it'll knock me down,

3325
02:14:38.80 --> 02:14:42.26
but it's gonna lessen over time and it's gonna dissipate.

3326
02:14:42.26 --> 02:14:47.26
So I think a lot of this is people don't understand

3327
02:14:47.44 --> 02:14:49.72
what's normal and I think that everything I just said

3328
02:14:49.72 --> 02:14:50.56
is totally normal.

3329
02:14:50.56 --> 02:14:51.88
And now that I've told that to a bunch of people,

3330
02:14:51.88 --> 02:14:52.72
yeah, this is what you're gonna feel,

3331
02:14:52.72 --> 02:14:54.76
they've been like, that's exactly what I felt.

3332
02:14:54.76 --> 02:14:58.48
And so getting the word out about, yeah, oh yeah,

3333
02:14:58.48 --> 02:14:59.32
you're gonna feel sad.

3334
02:14:59.32 --> 02:15:00.48
This doesn't mean you're depressed,

3335
02:15:00.48 --> 02:15:02.68
it means you're sad, your friend died.

3336
02:15:02.68 --> 02:15:04.92
Like that's a horrible thing,

3337
02:15:04.92 --> 02:15:08.28
but it's okay to feel sad and it's okay

3338
02:15:08.28 --> 02:15:10.84
and in a little while it'll dissipate.

3339
02:15:10.84 --> 02:15:13.20
That's another thing people get caught up in is,

3340
02:15:13.20 --> 02:15:17.76
oh, the strong emotions that I had are now dissipating.

3341
02:15:17.76 --> 02:15:20.60
I must be, I didn't really care about them

3342
02:15:20.60 --> 02:15:23.68
or I'm a bad person,

3343
02:15:23.68 --> 02:15:25.48
no, you're just processing it

3344
02:15:25.48 --> 02:15:27.64
and you're moving through this thing.

3345
02:15:27.64 --> 02:15:31.12
So I think a lot of just the,

3346
02:15:31.12 --> 02:15:33.64
you know, what you were talking about earlier,

3347
02:15:33.64 --> 02:15:37.16
Karlyn, of just not talking about things

3348
02:15:37.16 --> 02:15:38.44
and I've been very lucky.

3349
02:15:38.44 --> 02:15:41.24
And this is another thing I noticed about loss

3350
02:15:41.24 --> 02:15:43.46
is when I would lose one of my friends,

3351
02:15:43.46 --> 02:15:47.18
oftentimes I would be the person that would be giving

3352
02:15:47.18 --> 02:15:51.44
a speech or one of the people that would be writing down

3353
02:15:51.44 --> 02:15:53.72
my feelings about the situation,

3354
02:15:53.72 --> 02:15:54.96
about who this person was,

3355
02:15:54.96 --> 02:15:56.08
about what they meant to me,

3356
02:15:56.08 --> 02:15:57.96
about how awesome they were.

3357
02:15:57.96 --> 02:16:00.40
I'd have to go through that drill, mandatory,

3358
02:16:00.40 --> 02:16:01.84
because you're gonna get up and you're gonna talk,

3359
02:16:01.84 --> 02:16:02.68
you're gonna give a eulogy

3360
02:16:02.68 --> 02:16:05.48
or one of the eulogies at someone's funeral,

3361
02:16:05.48 --> 02:16:06.68
someone's memorial service.

3362
02:16:06.68 --> 02:16:08.20
So that's what you're doing.

3363
02:16:08.20 --> 02:16:11.64
What a cathartic thing that turned out to be.

3364
02:16:11.64 --> 02:16:14.04
Then I end up, when I get out of the Navy,

3365
02:16:14.04 --> 02:16:16.18
I end up writing books and oftentimes

3366
02:16:16.18 --> 02:16:18.60
these things are addressed in the books.

3367
02:16:18.60 --> 02:16:21.80
And being on this podcast or going out and speaking to

3368
02:16:21.80 --> 02:16:22.84
groups of people, guess what I'm doing?

3369
02:16:22.84 --> 02:16:26.20
I'm telling a story over and over again.

3370
02:16:26.20 --> 02:16:29.84
The same story about the same situation.

3371
02:16:29.84 --> 02:16:32.68
And each time you tell it, you go,

3372
02:16:32.68 --> 02:16:35.20
okay, you process it and it moves you further

3373
02:16:35.20 --> 02:16:37.72
down that road and it helps you detach from it,

3374
02:16:37.72 --> 02:16:40.24
not in a bad way, but in a good way,

3375
02:16:40.24 --> 02:16:42.80
where you can be truly appreciative of the friend

3376
02:16:42.80 --> 02:16:46.04
that you lost and say, yeah, it's horrible.

3377
02:16:46.04 --> 02:16:47.36
But guess what, I had some good times,

3378
02:16:47.36 --> 02:16:49.08
we had some great times, we had some incredible times.

3379
02:16:49.08 --> 02:16:53.12
And I'm gonna live a good life and not forget about them,

3380
02:16:53.12 --> 02:16:55.60
but I'm not gonna dwell on the fact that they died.

3381
02:16:55.60 --> 02:16:56.88
And by the way, guess what that means?

3382
02:16:56.88 --> 02:16:58.72
That means I'm gonna die too.

3383
02:16:58.72 --> 02:17:02.04
And everyone I know is gonna die.

3384
02:17:02.04 --> 02:17:07.04
And I can't get caught up and dwell on that fact for so long.

3385
02:17:07.32 --> 02:17:09.52
So it seems like those are the kind of things

3386
02:17:09.52 --> 02:17:14.14
that I think we could do better is letting people understand

3387
02:17:14.14 --> 02:17:14.96
what they're going through,

3388
02:17:14.96 --> 02:17:19.28
letting them understand that it's normal, it's normal.

3389
02:17:19.28 --> 02:17:21.88
It's normal to be like, oh yeah, what's wrong with Jocko?

3390
02:17:21.88 --> 02:17:23.52
He just heard a song and he's gonna go over there

3391
02:17:23.52 --> 02:17:25.80
and cry for like eight minutes.

3392
02:17:25.80 --> 02:17:27.80
And just then he's gonna be okay.

3393
02:17:27.80 --> 02:17:29.68
And Jocko is not embarrassed by it.

3394
02:17:29.68 --> 02:17:31.64
It's like, oh yeah, this song freaking

3395
02:17:31.64 --> 02:17:33.16
bums me out sometimes.

3396
02:17:33.16 --> 02:17:36.12
Okay, well, that's not abnormal.

3397
02:17:36.12 --> 02:17:38.12
You lost one of your best friends.

3398
02:17:38.12 --> 02:17:40.92
Okay, well, it's gonna be sad sometimes.

3399
02:17:40.92 --> 02:17:44.88
And I think that's one thing that we can do better

3400
02:17:44.88 --> 02:17:46.52
and I try and do that as much as I can

3401
02:17:46.52 --> 02:17:49.52
when we talk about these things on this podcast.

3402
02:17:49.52 --> 02:17:51.36
But it also sounds like that's the kind of thing

3403
02:17:51.36 --> 02:17:54.16
that you all would do with people

3404
02:17:54.16 --> 02:17:56.52
as you talk them through issues

3405
02:17:56.52 --> 02:17:57.48
that they've gone through in your life.

3406
02:17:57.48 --> 02:17:58.68
Am I accurate?

3407
02:17:58.68 --> 02:18:01.12
Absolutely, well, and to speak to the example

3408
02:18:01.12 --> 02:18:03.48
you gave with the gentleman you noticed

3409
02:18:03.48 --> 02:18:04.56
he was going to the bathroom.

3410
02:18:04.56 --> 02:18:05.76
I mean, you also saw him.

3411
02:18:05.76 --> 02:18:07.36
Like you saw him.

3412
02:18:07.36 --> 02:18:09.08
You saw he was struggling through something.

3413
02:18:09.08 --> 02:18:11.56
You chose to engage, you chose to interact.

3414
02:18:11.56 --> 02:18:12.96
And I think that that, you know,

3415
02:18:12.96 --> 02:18:15.28
not just from the encouragement or the cognitive part

3416
02:18:15.28 --> 02:18:16.92
of the conversation, but to see people,

3417
02:18:16.92 --> 02:18:20.12
to notice them is huge because, you know,

3418
02:18:20.12 --> 02:18:21.84
that could have gone completely unnoticed

3419
02:18:21.84 --> 02:18:23.48
and in his mind he could have created

3420
02:18:23.48 --> 02:18:25.08
a whole different narrative about everybody else

3421
02:18:25.08 --> 02:18:26.88
seems to be fine and they're doing okay

3422
02:18:26.88 --> 02:18:27.72
and they've got it together.

3423
02:18:27.72 --> 02:18:28.56
Isn't there a bunch of seals?

3424
02:18:28.56 --> 02:18:29.40
They're all acting like they're fine.

3425
02:18:29.40 --> 02:18:32.88
And I'm different in some ways, you know.

3426
02:18:32.88 --> 02:18:34.80
So to see that person to make that eye contact.

3427
02:18:34.80 --> 02:18:35.76
Yeah, like I must be a coward.

3428
02:18:35.76 --> 02:18:36.60
That's the scary thing.

3429
02:18:36.60 --> 02:18:37.72
Like I must be a coward.

3430
02:18:37.72 --> 02:18:40.72
Oh my gosh, why is everyone walking around like a badass?

3431
02:18:40.72 --> 02:18:42.000
And I'm sitting here like a coward.

3432
02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.88
Yep, and in the absence of the communication

3433
02:18:43.88 --> 02:18:45.68
or in the attunement that you gave him,

3434
02:18:45.68 --> 02:18:47.28
like all kinds of things can happen.

3435
02:18:47.28 --> 02:18:48.28
So that's huge.

3436
02:18:49.16 --> 02:18:53.36
Yeah, and I think with, especially in the treatment world

3437
02:18:53.36 --> 02:18:57.88
and at a new for sure, a lot of our clients come in.

3438
02:18:57.88 --> 02:19:01.40
The ones who have been in the system for a bit,

3439
02:19:01.40 --> 02:19:03.44
this is like not their first rodeo.

3440
02:19:03.44 --> 02:19:06.68
There is that identity that has almost been adopted

3441
02:19:06.68 --> 02:19:09.80
a lot of the times, like I'm schizophrenic.

3442
02:19:09.80 --> 02:19:11.40
So I need to take these pills.

3443
02:19:11.40 --> 02:19:12.24
Curse.

3444
02:19:12.24 --> 02:19:13.36
Yeah, I'm cursed.

3445
02:19:13.36 --> 02:19:14.88
I need to take these pills.

3446
02:19:14.88 --> 02:19:16.04
What, why are you taking them?

3447
02:19:16.04 --> 02:19:18.08
I don't know, it's just what they give me.

3448
02:19:18.08 --> 02:19:19.44
Right, there's this kind of,

3449
02:19:21.08 --> 02:19:22.96
when will my symptoms go away?

3450
02:19:22.96 --> 02:19:26.44
Right, this lack of what you're talking about is like,

3451
02:19:26.44 --> 02:19:28.28
it's totally normal that that's happening today.

3452
02:19:28.28 --> 02:19:29.72
I get yesterday you felt great

3453
02:19:29.72 --> 02:19:32.60
and today you woke up thinking these things

3454
02:19:32.60 --> 02:19:35.08
that you weren't thinking yesterday.

3455
02:19:35.08 --> 02:19:38.04
Yes, we're gonna move and march toward

3456
02:19:38.04 --> 02:19:39.80
look, what can we do about it?

3457
02:19:39.80 --> 02:19:41.52
What can we do to help you feel better?

3458
02:19:41.52 --> 02:19:43.60
Sometimes it's just going and having your cry over there

3459
02:19:43.60 --> 02:19:45.80
and then come back on over, totally fine.

3460
02:19:45.80 --> 02:19:48.80
But the idea of validating is what you're talking about.

3461
02:19:48.80 --> 02:19:50.48
It's like, yep, that's happening.

3462
02:19:50.48 --> 02:19:52.12
I get it and it sucks today

3463
02:19:52.12 --> 02:19:53.96
and it may even suck tomorrow.

3464
02:19:53.96 --> 02:19:55.68
You have schizophrenia.

3465
02:19:55.68 --> 02:19:57.28
This might be something that you deal with

3466
02:19:57.28 --> 02:19:58.72
on and off your entire life,

3467
02:19:58.72 --> 02:20:02.68
but by doing these things, having it normalized,

3468
02:20:02.68 --> 02:20:07.24
people being seen, people supporting versus,

3469
02:20:07.24 --> 02:20:08.84
why are you doing that?

3470
02:20:08.84 --> 02:20:10.76
Over time, it gets less and less.

3471
02:20:10.76 --> 02:20:12.52
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say,

3472
02:20:12.52 --> 02:20:13.88
but the little kid that asked me,

3473
02:20:13.88 --> 02:20:15.52
like I feel like I'm alone.

3474
02:20:15.52 --> 02:20:17.08
Yeah, you're gonna feel alone.

3475
02:20:17.08 --> 02:20:17.92
That's totally normal.

3476
02:20:17.92 --> 02:20:18.88
Sometimes you're gonna be alone.

3477
02:20:18.88 --> 02:20:20.20
Like that's gonna happen.

3478
02:20:20.20 --> 02:20:23.80
And when you're a teenager and you don't get invited

3479
02:20:23.80 --> 02:20:26.000
to the party, you're gonna be bummed out.

3480
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.16
That's just normal.

3481
02:20:27.16 --> 02:20:29.16
That's just like, oh, and when you're a teenager

3482
02:20:29.16 --> 02:20:32.04
and your boyfriend or your girlfriend dumps you,

3483
02:20:32.04 --> 02:20:33.28
yeah, you're gonna feel sad.

3484
02:20:33.28 --> 02:20:34.64
And that's just the way you feel.

3485
02:20:34.64 --> 02:20:36.04
And in a little while, you won't even remember

3486
02:20:36.04 --> 02:20:37.64
that person was and you'll carry on with the rest of your life.

3487
02:20:37.64 --> 02:20:42.64
So being aware of what's going on in these peaks

3488
02:20:42.76 --> 02:20:46.24
and valleys of life, knowing that they're there,

3489
02:20:46.24 --> 02:20:48.68
is such a positive thing.

3490
02:20:48.68 --> 02:20:50.24
And a lot of times, and I guess,

3491
02:20:50.24 --> 02:20:51.52
especially going back to social media,

3492
02:20:51.52 --> 02:20:53.40
it's like, oh, if all I see on social media

3493
02:20:53.40 --> 02:20:55.08
is everyone smiling and happy and looks,

3494
02:20:55.08 --> 02:20:57.04
you know, like they're doing some awesome thing

3495
02:20:57.04 --> 02:21:00.64
and I'm sitting at home in my room alone.

3496
02:21:00.64 --> 02:21:02.36
Like, that's life.

3497
02:21:02.36 --> 02:21:03.48
You're gonna be alone.

3498
02:21:03.48 --> 02:21:04.60
You're gonna get dumped.

3499
02:21:04.60 --> 02:21:07.32
You're not gonna get invited to the cool guy party

3500
02:21:07.32 --> 02:21:08.52
and all these things are gonna happen

3501
02:21:08.52 --> 02:21:11.96
and they're totally normal and you'll get through them

3502
02:21:11.96 --> 02:21:15.56
and they're not gonna be fun, but that's the way it is.

3503
02:21:15.56 --> 02:21:20.40
We get a lot of people that don't even recognize

3504
02:21:20.40 --> 02:21:22.60
that this is the way life is.

3505
02:21:22.60 --> 02:21:24.96
Well, actually, we were just talking the other day.

3506
02:21:24.96 --> 02:21:27.68
You know, my friend, Jordan Peterson,

3507
02:21:27.68 --> 02:21:29.48
will say life is suffering, right?

3508
02:21:29.48 --> 02:21:31.08
And it's like a religious context.

3509
02:21:31.08 --> 02:21:32.48
The Buddha says life is suffering.

3510
02:21:32.48 --> 02:21:35.56
And I was like, yeah, you know, I get it.

3511
02:21:35.56 --> 02:21:37.44
That's a good way, it's a good thing to know.

3512
02:21:37.44 --> 02:21:42.000
It's a good thing to know that in life, there is suffering.

3513
02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:42.84
Right?

3514
02:21:42.84 --> 02:21:44.88
But you don't have to go and say life,

3515
02:21:44.88 --> 02:21:46.36
all of life is suffering.

3516
02:21:46.36 --> 02:21:48.32
There's gonna be some valleys, you know?

3517
02:21:48.32 --> 02:21:49.80
There's gonna be some darkness.

3518
02:21:49.80 --> 02:21:52.44
We get it, but it's not all of life.

3519
02:21:52.44 --> 02:21:54.44
And you're gonna come out of that.

3520
02:21:54.44 --> 02:21:55.32
You're gonna see some light.

3521
02:21:55.32 --> 02:21:56.80
You're gonna have some fun.

3522
02:21:56.80 --> 02:21:59.32
But then you're gonna get sucked down

3523
02:21:59.32 --> 02:22:00.60
into some darkness again.

3524
02:22:00.60 --> 02:22:03.32
And that's what I think people don't,

3525
02:22:03.32 --> 02:22:04.80
or what I think people need to understand

3526
02:22:04.80 --> 02:22:06.36
is there's a cycle to life.

3527
02:22:06.36 --> 02:22:07.20
And you're gonna have some good

3528
02:22:07.20 --> 02:22:08.04
and you're gonna have some bad.

3529
02:22:08.04 --> 02:22:09.48
And that's the same with everybody.

3530
02:22:09.48 --> 02:22:14.24
No one is just basking in the sun

3531
02:22:14.24 --> 02:22:16.48
and the warmth for their whole life,

3532
02:22:16.48 --> 02:22:18.48
unless you're only looking at them on Instagram,

3533
02:22:18.48 --> 02:22:19.60
in which case they're doing it

3534
02:22:19.60 --> 02:22:21.64
and they're doing it in a G-string bikini.

3535
02:22:21.64 --> 02:22:23.72
That's the way they're doing it.

3536
02:22:23.72 --> 02:22:24.56
That's true.

3537
02:22:24.56 --> 02:22:27.36
And with PTSD, a lot of other things too.

3538
02:22:27.36 --> 02:22:30.04
A lot of other conditions or diagnosis.

3539
02:22:30.04 --> 02:22:31.60
I mean, I've heard this so many times,

3540
02:22:31.60 --> 02:22:33.36
we definitely hear it at the treatment center

3541
02:22:33.36 --> 02:22:36.04
for people who've been maybe in an illness

3542
02:22:36.04 --> 02:22:36.96
for a lot longer.

3543
02:22:36.96 --> 02:22:38.48
So when is this gonna go away?

3544
02:22:38.48 --> 02:22:40.40
When am I gonna not have this anymore?

3545
02:22:40.40 --> 02:22:42.56
And this idea of like, it may not,

3546
02:22:42.56 --> 02:22:43.96
kind of like with trauma, right?

3547
02:22:43.96 --> 02:22:46.36
Every time you remember that buddy or hear that song,

3548
02:22:46.36 --> 02:22:48.60
you're gonna have a little something show up.

3549
02:22:48.60 --> 02:22:51.04
And yeah, is it less than before?

3550
02:22:51.04 --> 02:22:54.000
Sure, but like your whole life,

3551
02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.28
every time you hear that song,

3552
02:22:55.28 --> 02:22:57.000
you might feel a little something going on there

3553
02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:57.96
and that's okay.

3554
02:22:57.96 --> 02:22:59.48
Like it's totally normal.

3555
02:22:59.48 --> 02:23:01.92
I feel that when I hear the star-spangled banner.

3556
02:23:01.92 --> 02:23:02.76
Yes, every time.

3557
02:23:02.76 --> 02:23:04.96
Like when I hear the star-spangled banner,

3558
02:23:04.96 --> 02:23:08.40
if I'm not careful, I'll get like super emotional.

3559
02:23:08.40 --> 02:23:09.24
From the start.

3560
02:23:09.24 --> 02:23:10.56
And that's a song that you hear a lot, right?

3561
02:23:10.56 --> 02:23:11.40
All the time.

3562
02:23:11.40 --> 02:23:12.76
I mean, you heard every sporting event.

3563
02:23:12.76 --> 02:23:15.36
So yeah, and here's the thing.

3564
02:23:15.36 --> 02:23:17.44
I guess in my own narcissistic mind,

3565
02:23:17.44 --> 02:23:20.04
I've thought, hey, that's normal and that's okay.

3566
02:23:20.04 --> 02:23:22.28
It's okay, it's okay to feel like that.

3567
02:23:22.28 --> 02:23:23.92
This is the way things go.

3568
02:23:23.92 --> 02:23:28.68
Where you mentioned, quickly there, you mentioned drugs.

3569
02:23:28.68 --> 02:23:31.20
And I just had a friend of mine on the podcast

3570
02:23:31.20 --> 02:23:35.68
who by the time he went and sought help

3571
02:23:35.68 --> 02:23:37.20
in the Navy, he was in the SEAL teams,

3572
02:23:37.20 --> 02:23:39.24
by the time he went and sought help,

3573
02:23:39.24 --> 02:23:41.20
he got immediately prescribed something.

3574
02:23:41.20 --> 02:23:43.84
By the time he got out a year or two later,

3575
02:23:43.84 --> 02:23:48.84
he was on seven different drugs.

3576
02:23:50.20 --> 02:23:55.20
You know, this one to get you amped up for the day,

3577
02:23:55.28 --> 02:23:57.16
this one to keep you level-headed,

3578
02:23:57.16 --> 02:23:58.64
this one to put you to sleep at night,

3579
02:23:58.64 --> 02:24:01.56
is like they're all counter to each other.

3580
02:24:01.56 --> 02:24:04.36
And just a disaster.

3581
02:24:05.24 --> 02:24:08.68
At what point, where do these drugs come into play?

3582
02:24:08.68 --> 02:24:11.04
Now, he and I both acknowledged,

3583
02:24:11.04 --> 02:24:12.92
and again, this is something that I know

3584
02:24:12.92 --> 02:24:16.36
from talking and reading, is absolutely,

3585
02:24:16.36 --> 02:24:18.88
there's times like, oh, this person needs

3586
02:24:18.88 --> 02:24:22.32
this specific drug to help them get through the situation.

3587
02:24:23.52 --> 02:24:26.56
Where do you all think these drugs come into play

3588
02:24:26.56 --> 02:24:29.40
and what do we need to be careful of?

3589
02:24:29.40 --> 02:24:31.92
Yeah, I mean, I'm not a psychiatrist,

3590
02:24:31.92 --> 02:24:33.24
so it's hard to speak to that part.

3591
02:24:33.24 --> 02:24:35.40
But generally when somebody's coming in

3592
02:24:35.40 --> 02:24:37.20
on a bunch of different medications,

3593
02:24:37.20 --> 02:24:39.36
you know, there's a conversation about like,

3594
02:24:39.36 --> 02:24:41.56
do you know what you're taking?

3595
02:24:41.56 --> 02:24:43.84
Oftentimes with folks with complex psychiatric disorders,

3596
02:24:43.84 --> 02:24:45.28
they don't.

3597
02:24:45.28 --> 02:24:46.36
It's just, this is what I was told to take.

3598
02:24:46.36 --> 02:24:48.88
You know, what it's treating,

3599
02:24:48.88 --> 02:24:50.60
how do you know that it's helping you

3600
02:24:50.60 --> 02:24:52.32
and really starting to discern that?

3601
02:24:52.32 --> 02:24:55.04
Because I mean, I think we, you know,

3602
02:24:55.04 --> 02:24:57.12
and this, my opinion in some ways,

3603
02:24:57.12 --> 02:24:59.28
been in a culture of sort of instant gratification

3604
02:24:59.28 --> 02:25:01.80
or seeking something outside of myself to soothe.

3605
02:25:01.80 --> 02:25:03.52
You know, there's a lot of benefit

3606
02:25:03.52 --> 02:25:05.84
to various psychiatric medications.

3607
02:25:05.84 --> 02:25:08.08
They can really help stabilize someone in a place

3608
02:25:08.08 --> 02:25:09.08
where without otherwise,

3609
02:25:09.08 --> 02:25:12.36
they might not be able to receive some of that treatment.

3610
02:25:12.36 --> 02:25:14.64
And at some point, assessing like,

3611
02:25:14.64 --> 02:25:17.56
why I use this, I think is really important, right?

3612
02:25:17.56 --> 02:25:19.24
Do I use it because I think it's gonna fix

3613
02:25:19.24 --> 02:25:20.52
or take this thing away?

3614
02:25:20.52 --> 02:25:22.88
I think this would apply to not just a prescription drug,

3615
02:25:22.88 --> 02:25:23.92
but any kind of substance.

3616
02:25:23.92 --> 02:25:25.08
You know, why do I drink?

3617
02:25:25.08 --> 02:25:26.36
Do I do because, you know,

3618
02:25:26.36 --> 02:25:28.68
I enjoy a glass of wine at night or whatever it may be,

3619
02:25:28.68 --> 02:25:30.60
or do I drink to alter my mood?

3620
02:25:30.60 --> 02:25:32.12
Do I change this to alter my mood in a way

3621
02:25:32.12 --> 02:25:34.56
because I don't feel like I can do this independently

3622
02:25:34.56 --> 02:25:35.40
or on my own.

3623
02:25:35.40 --> 02:25:38.24
So I think assessing why someone is using

3624
02:25:38.24 --> 02:25:39.20
the various amount of things

3625
02:25:39.20 --> 02:25:40.68
and their understanding of it.

3626
02:25:40.68 --> 02:25:42.56
And, you know, one of the things,

3627
02:25:42.56 --> 02:25:44.68
the benefits of being able to do a long-term treatment

3628
02:25:44.68 --> 02:25:47.12
in a structured environment is it gives us an opportunity

3629
02:25:47.12 --> 02:25:50.14
to sort of unpack some of these things, obviously,

3630
02:25:50.14 --> 02:25:52.08
with the support of a psychiatrist and somebody,

3631
02:25:52.08 --> 02:25:54.36
you know, who's medical overseeing their care,

3632
02:25:54.36 --> 02:25:57.68
to see, you know, what, in fact,

3633
02:25:57.68 --> 02:25:59.16
is this actually treating at this point?

3634
02:25:59.16 --> 02:26:00.40
Is it helpful?

3635
02:26:00.40 --> 02:26:02.32
And if it is, great.

3636
02:26:03.24 --> 02:26:05.76
But also too, does it take us out of the role

3637
02:26:05.76 --> 02:26:06.60
of like the work?

3638
02:26:06.60 --> 02:26:08.72
Because, you know, therapy is hard work.

3639
02:26:08.72 --> 02:26:11.16
Like people who I think therapy is a soft place to come

3640
02:26:11.16 --> 02:26:12.84
at whatever, therapy is hard work.

3641
02:26:12.84 --> 02:26:14.28
Someone who commits to therapy

3642
02:26:14.28 --> 02:26:16.12
is really willing to do some work.

3643
02:26:16.12 --> 02:26:16.96
I mean, unless you're in a place

3644
02:26:16.96 --> 02:26:18.32
where somebody's just like buttering you up

3645
02:26:18.32 --> 02:26:19.60
and giving you compliments all day long,

3646
02:26:19.60 --> 02:26:20.92
but when you come to do therapy,

3647
02:26:20.92 --> 02:26:22.20
you come to do work, especially

3648
02:26:22.20 --> 02:26:23.96
in a residential treatment center,

3649
02:26:23.96 --> 02:26:26.12
you're not just receiving all these things.

3650
02:26:26.12 --> 02:26:27.96
But medications often is this notion of like,

3651
02:26:27.96 --> 02:26:29.08
I'm just taking this thing,

3652
02:26:29.08 --> 02:26:32.28
but there's no, it's very different

3653
02:26:32.28 --> 02:26:35.28
than the amount of effort that's involved

3654
02:26:35.28 --> 02:26:37.32
in walking through a very difficult situation

3655
02:26:37.32 --> 02:26:39.92
or if I'm afraid of something in particular

3656
02:26:39.92 --> 02:26:43.48
I haven't gone to address some of this unresolved grief

3657
02:26:43.48 --> 02:26:45.52
or, you know, whatever it might be,

3658
02:26:45.52 --> 02:26:47.88
you know, engaging in that behavior is very difficult.

3659
02:26:47.88 --> 02:26:51.000
It's gonna bring up a lot of feelings

3660
02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:54.84
and walking through that can be incredibly healing.

3661
02:26:54.84 --> 02:26:56.52
A very different approach than if I'm choosing

3662
02:26:56.52 --> 02:26:59.48
to just take something to get rid of something.

3663
02:26:59.48 --> 02:27:01.20
Well, I think there's like an agency thing,

3664
02:27:01.20 --> 02:27:03.16
which I think shows up in a lot of your work.

3665
02:27:03.16 --> 02:27:05.44
I mean, even just what you've shared today

3666
02:27:05.44 --> 02:27:08.92
is people say like, oh, I'm feeling so much,

3667
02:27:08.92 --> 02:27:09.88
I'm gonna call my esophageal,

3668
02:27:09.88 --> 02:27:10.72
so I'm gonna call the doctor.

3669
02:27:10.72 --> 02:27:13.04
I need something for this.

3670
02:27:13.04 --> 02:27:16.000
Is very external, one instant gratification,

3671
02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.44
but also this, whether the person's aware of it or not,

3672
02:27:19.44 --> 02:27:21.24
this idea that like, I don't believe

3673
02:27:21.24 --> 02:27:23.32
in my ability to manage myself.

3674
02:27:23.32 --> 02:27:26.48
I need you to give me something to feel better.

3675
02:27:26.48 --> 02:27:29.52
And a lot of the longer term work in therapy,

3676
02:27:29.52 --> 02:27:31.96
definitely in our program, because it's so,

3677
02:27:31.96 --> 02:27:35.000
it's longer term, is this idea of helping people

3678
02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:38.08
internalize agency versus just rely on external things

3679
02:27:38.08 --> 02:27:39.84
to like make them be okay.

3680
02:27:40.76 --> 02:27:42.24
You know, that seems like a basic principle

3681
02:27:42.24 --> 02:27:43.72
of success in life.

3682
02:27:43.72 --> 02:27:45.32
But you'd be amazed with people

3683
02:27:45.32 --> 02:27:48.60
with some of these complex psychiatric diagnoses

3684
02:27:48.60 --> 02:27:53.44
that the sense of personal agency is so low,

3685
02:27:53.44 --> 02:27:54.88
whether it's like, I just take these pills

3686
02:27:54.88 --> 02:27:56.60
because my psychiatrist says I'm supposed to

3687
02:27:56.60 --> 02:27:58.36
or my mom says I need to,

3688
02:27:58.36 --> 02:28:01.08
versus like, do you know what are you taking?

3689
02:28:01.08 --> 02:28:02.96
Or having conversation with your doctor

3690
02:28:02.96 --> 02:28:05.56
about side effects or whatever.

3691
02:28:05.56 --> 02:28:09.76
But the sense of, I don't have what it takes

3692
02:28:09.76 --> 02:28:14.20
to manage myself and my situation and the demands of life.

3693
02:28:14.20 --> 02:28:16.000
So I need- That's a horrible mindset.

3694
02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.56
Horrible, and it's very, very common

3695
02:28:18.56 --> 02:28:20.96
with mental illness.

3696
02:28:20.96 --> 02:28:24.24
And I mentioned, I talked about SSRIs

3697
02:28:24.24 --> 02:28:29.16
on some other podcast and I read through the comments

3698
02:28:29.16 --> 02:28:30.96
and there was definitely some people that were like,

3699
02:28:30.96 --> 02:28:32.96
hey, these things really helped me.

3700
02:28:32.96 --> 02:28:35.68
And there was, of course, you're gonna get that side

3701
02:28:35.68 --> 02:28:37.32
and you of course got the side of like,

3702
02:28:37.32 --> 02:28:39.60
oh, that stuff was a disaster for me.

3703
02:28:40.52 --> 02:28:42.92
The side effects, when you read the side effects,

3704
02:28:42.92 --> 02:28:44.44
you're like, oh my God, you know,

3705
02:28:44.44 --> 02:28:46.72
like emotional, blunting, violence, bipolar,

3706
02:28:46.72 --> 02:28:49.96
switch, suicide risk from the medicine that you're taking.

3707
02:28:49.96 --> 02:28:52.80
So there's definite risks need to,

3708
02:28:52.80 --> 02:28:54.96
that needs to be paid attention to.

3709
02:28:56.76 --> 02:29:00.56
The other side of the spectrum, as far as I'm concerned,

3710
02:29:00.56 --> 02:29:03.36
is something that you already mentioned, Karlin.

3711
02:29:04.44 --> 02:29:08.84
What about just like a sleep, diet, and exercise?

3712
02:29:08.84 --> 02:29:13.16
How often are we blowing that?

3713
02:29:13.16 --> 02:29:14.000
Often.

3714
02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:14.84
Often.

3715
02:29:14.84 --> 02:29:15.68
Often.

3716
02:29:15.68 --> 02:29:18.08
I mean, it is amazing when we bring folks

3717
02:29:18.08 --> 02:29:20.56
into the program, we try and set aside

3718
02:29:20.56 --> 02:29:22.88
like kind of the first month, give or take,

3719
02:29:22.88 --> 02:29:24.04
it may take longer.

3720
02:29:24.04 --> 02:29:27.68
Cause this person maybe has not been sleeping well at all.

3721
02:29:27.68 --> 02:29:29.48
Not eating well.

3722
02:29:29.48 --> 02:29:32.04
Like maybe they've been using, maybe they haven't.

3723
02:29:32.04 --> 02:29:33.12
Poor hygiene.

3724
02:29:33.12 --> 02:29:35.60
Caffeine, smoking, I mean, you name it.

3725
02:29:35.60 --> 02:29:38.96
So just like getting somebody eating well

3726
02:29:38.96 --> 02:29:42.12
and on a regular basis, getting some physical exercise,

3727
02:29:42.12 --> 02:29:45.24
getting like their sleep hygiene in order.

3728
02:29:45.24 --> 02:29:47.32
Structuring some habits throughout the day.

3729
02:29:47.32 --> 02:29:49.80
You wouldn't be amazed how much changes

3730
02:29:49.80 --> 02:29:51.84
just in that little period of time.

3731
02:29:51.84 --> 02:29:53.68
And we've talked with folks that,

3732
02:29:53.68 --> 02:29:55.36
and this is also related to the meds,

3733
02:29:55.36 --> 02:29:56.76
is sometimes when people have,

3734
02:29:56.76 --> 02:29:58.36
they're seeing multiple doctors,

3735
02:29:58.36 --> 02:30:01.48
or they go in and they see a different doctor every time.

3736
02:30:01.48 --> 02:30:03.08
And they may not be coordinating,

3737
02:30:03.08 --> 02:30:05.24
so you're just getting all kinds of meds and things

3738
02:30:05.24 --> 02:30:07.64
that may not even really go together.

3739
02:30:07.64 --> 02:30:09.04
So same with diagnoses.

3740
02:30:09.04 --> 02:30:13.36
We've had folks come in with a laundry list of diagnoses.

3741
02:30:13.36 --> 02:30:16.08
I'm like, you can't even have half of those at the same time.

3742
02:30:16.08 --> 02:30:17.08
They're both at the same time.

3743
02:30:17.08 --> 02:30:18.72
But these were all little snapshots of,

3744
02:30:18.72 --> 02:30:20.92
oh, this trip to the ER and this trip to the hospital,

3745
02:30:20.92 --> 02:30:22.44
like this is what they look like that day.

3746
02:30:22.44 --> 02:30:23.56
And that's what they look like this day.

3747
02:30:23.56 --> 02:30:25.44
It doesn't mean they have all of those things.

3748
02:30:25.44 --> 02:30:29.48
So let's get them eating and sleeping and in a routine

3749
02:30:29.48 --> 02:30:32.32
and comfortable showering.

3750
02:30:32.32 --> 02:30:33.16
Physical activity.

3751
02:30:33.16 --> 02:30:37.80
It's the basic psychological and physical wellness and safety.

3752
02:30:37.80 --> 02:30:38.64
And guess what?

3753
02:30:38.64 --> 02:30:40.72
Almost all of these diagnoses go away.

3754
02:30:40.72 --> 02:30:43.32
Maybe we're left with these couple right here.

3755
02:30:43.32 --> 02:30:45.92
Yeah, I was on Joe Rogan's podcast,

3756
02:30:45.92 --> 02:30:50.92
and it was the morning of Chris Cornell

3757
02:30:51.20 --> 02:30:53.36
from Soundgarden had killed himself.

3758
02:30:53.36 --> 02:30:58.16
And of course, Joe and I started talking about it.

3759
02:30:58.16 --> 02:31:02.24
And look, we're just a couple of knuckle-draggers talking.

3760
02:31:02.24 --> 02:31:05.04
But both of us were kind of like, man,

3761
02:31:05.04 --> 02:31:07.72
get a kettlebell to work out.

3762
02:31:07.72 --> 02:31:09.96
And again, like I said,

3763
02:31:09.96 --> 02:31:13.68
we're just a couple knuckle-draggers talking.

3764
02:31:13.68 --> 02:31:18.04
And again, reading the comments, people are like,

3765
02:31:18.04 --> 02:31:20.92
oh, you think just working out's gonna solve everything.

3766
02:31:20.92 --> 02:31:24.60
And of course, I don't think that, but damn,

3767
02:31:24.60 --> 02:31:26.44
it's a good thing to do.

3768
02:31:26.44 --> 02:31:27.68
Go get healthy.

3769
02:31:27.68 --> 02:31:29.92
Get on a sleep schedule where you're doing,

3770
02:31:29.92 --> 02:31:32.000
like where you're getting some good sleep.

3771
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.52
Eat good food.

3772
02:31:33.52 --> 02:31:35.20
Stop eating trash.

3773
02:31:35.20 --> 02:31:37.08
Go outside.

3774
02:31:37.08 --> 02:31:38.72
Move around.

3775
02:31:38.72 --> 02:31:40.000
This is real, right?

3776
02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.72
Yeah, I mean, it's both and.

3777
02:31:41.72 --> 02:31:43.92
Because without the structure that we create,

3778
02:31:43.92 --> 02:31:46.68
the therapeutic process that we try to do is not possible.

3779
02:31:46.68 --> 02:31:49.28
Like without the routine, without the sleep,

3780
02:31:49.28 --> 02:31:51.000
without the healthy eating,

3781
02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.92
can't actually do that therapeutic part.

3782
02:31:52.92 --> 02:31:54.48
So there's a lot that can happen

3783
02:31:54.48 --> 02:31:57.16
in that initial structure of physical activity and all this.

3784
02:31:57.16 --> 02:31:59.28
And for those folks with those clinical aspects

3785
02:31:59.28 --> 02:32:02.08
that require a deeper level of therapeutic intervention

3786
02:32:02.08 --> 02:32:04.88
or psychiatric support, that's the framework.

3787
02:32:04.88 --> 02:32:05.80
That has to maintain.

3788
02:32:05.80 --> 02:32:07.000
That never changes.

3789
02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:10.44
That structure and stability is the main component

3790
02:32:10.44 --> 02:32:13.04
that holds the foundation for everything else

3791
02:32:13.04 --> 02:32:14.20
to be able to be possible.

3792
02:32:14.20 --> 02:32:18.24
So it's definitely, with any sort of complex human issue,

3793
02:32:18.24 --> 02:32:20.88
you can't say that one thing is gonna solve anything.

3794
02:32:20.88 --> 02:32:21.72
Of course.

3795
02:32:21.72 --> 02:32:24.92
But that is undoubtedly the foundation for,

3796
02:32:24.92 --> 02:32:27.84
which all else sort of occurs for our folks

3797
02:32:27.84 --> 02:32:30.28
and becomes the thing that they maintain long term

3798
02:32:30.28 --> 02:32:31.64
when they move into their own houses.

3799
02:32:31.64 --> 02:32:33.80
They're still getting up at a certain time.

3800
02:32:33.80 --> 02:32:36.20
They might pick their day that they go grocery shopping.

3801
02:32:36.20 --> 02:32:38.04
They might, because that structure and routine

3802
02:32:38.04 --> 02:32:39.96
is very helpful.

3803
02:32:39.96 --> 02:32:42.68
Human beings like that, don't we?

3804
02:32:42.68 --> 02:32:43.92
And when you live without it,

3805
02:32:43.92 --> 02:32:48.92
it's just the beginning of possible serious issues.

3806
02:32:49.40 --> 02:32:52.28
Now, here's another thing that I talked about on a podcast.

3807
02:32:52.28 --> 02:32:56.48
This was around mass shootings.

3808
02:32:56.48 --> 02:33:00.60
And as myself and my friend Darrell were looking

3809
02:33:00.60 --> 02:33:04.64
into the various causes behind these mass shootings,

3810
02:33:04.64 --> 02:33:09.64
one of the most shocking pieces of information

3811
02:33:10.60 --> 02:33:12.72
that we came across is this right here.

3812
02:33:12.72 --> 02:33:17.72
So in 1955, in America, there were 340 inpatient beds

3813
02:33:19.48 --> 02:33:21.76
per 100,000 people.

3814
02:33:21.76 --> 02:33:23.88
So I'm gonna say that again in 1955,

3815
02:33:23.88 --> 02:33:28.32
1955 for every 100,000 people there were in America,

3816
02:33:28.32 --> 02:33:33.32
there were 340 inpatient beds for mental health care.

3817
02:33:35.72 --> 02:33:40.40
Now, here we are, you fast forward to 2007.

3818
02:33:40.40 --> 02:33:45.40
In 2007, there were only 17 beds for every 100,000 people.

3819
02:33:49.08 --> 02:33:51.72
And here we are, we talk about mental health all the time.

3820
02:33:51.72 --> 02:33:54.76
Now, some of the feedback that I got about that episode

3821
02:33:54.76 --> 02:33:59.000
was that in the 50s and 60s,

3822
02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.08
there were these really heinous,

3823
02:34:02.08 --> 02:34:05.56
some really heinous events that happened

3824
02:34:05.56 --> 02:34:09.48
inside these psychiatric wards and people were abused.

3825
02:34:09.48 --> 02:34:12.68
And they pretty much from everything I can tell

3826
02:34:12.68 --> 02:34:15.32
threw the baby out of the bathwater and just said,

3827
02:34:15.32 --> 02:34:17.12
oh, you know what, we're just gonna shut these things.

3828
02:34:17.12 --> 02:34:21.92
Abuse happens in these places, we'll shut them all down.

3829
02:34:23.48 --> 02:34:26.72
I think about, like, you know, I live in San Diego.

3830
02:34:26.72 --> 02:34:28.64
I think about what there's a couple million people

3831
02:34:28.64 --> 02:34:31.12
in San Diego, that means that there would be

3832
02:34:31.12 --> 02:34:36.12
a few thousand inpatient beds if we were on the 1955 levels.

3833
02:34:36.64 --> 02:34:38.88
And if you go around San Diego

3834
02:34:38.88 --> 02:34:40.60
and you go look at the homeless people,

3835
02:34:40.60 --> 02:34:45.60
many of whom have psychological and mental health issues,

3836
02:34:45.60 --> 02:34:47.04
if you opened up all those beds,

3837
02:34:47.04 --> 02:34:48.60
they would probably fill them

3838
02:34:48.60 --> 02:34:50.72
and we'd be in a much different place.

3839
02:34:50.72 --> 02:34:53.32
And these people would be getting some kind of treatment

3840
02:34:53.32 --> 02:34:54.84
that they actually need.

3841
02:34:54.84 --> 02:34:58.04
What do you think happened with this?

3842
02:34:58.04 --> 02:35:00.08
Is it just the abuse that took place,

3843
02:35:00.08 --> 02:35:02.36
we shut them down, is there anything else?

3844
02:35:02.36 --> 02:35:04.000
I mean, there's a lot to this.

3845
02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.72
I mean, you're talking about the deinstitutionalization.

3846
02:35:06.72 --> 02:35:08.68
Like, I mean, some of this started even back

3847
02:35:08.68 --> 02:35:12.48
into the 1700s, but there's like, at the time,

3848
02:35:12.48 --> 02:35:13.88
in the time that you're referring to,

3849
02:35:13.88 --> 02:35:16.04
primarily residential facilities

3850
02:35:16.04 --> 02:35:18.52
is where folks would be able to take their loved ones

3851
02:35:18.52 --> 02:35:19.52
with mental health, right?

3852
02:35:19.52 --> 02:35:20.84
So if people had mental health issues,

3853
02:35:20.84 --> 02:35:23.04
they went into these residential facilities

3854
02:35:23.04 --> 02:35:25.92
and that's where they primarily received treatment,

3855
02:35:25.92 --> 02:35:27.52
or just a place to stay.

3856
02:35:27.52 --> 02:35:30.52
And then as that evolved, sometimes,

3857
02:35:30.52 --> 02:35:32.88
I think the term asylum came along at some point,

3858
02:35:32.88 --> 02:35:34.52
this became a place where people could stay

3859
02:35:34.52 --> 02:35:36.72
and also work and session they were having.

3860
02:35:36.72 --> 02:35:39.80
But what was really happening on the inside

3861
02:35:39.80 --> 02:35:41.92
was a pretty restrictive setting in some ways.

3862
02:35:41.92 --> 02:35:44.44
And then there was some people that had gone in

3863
02:35:44.44 --> 02:35:47.24
and saw all this horrific stuff that was happening.

3864
02:35:47.24 --> 02:35:49.72
And so ultimately, all of these sort of things

3865
02:35:49.72 --> 02:35:51.88
move towards this idea that a person is entitled

3866
02:35:51.88 --> 02:35:53.44
to the least restrictive settings.

3867
02:35:53.44 --> 02:35:54.64
And there's a lot of stuff that happened

3868
02:35:54.64 --> 02:35:56.16
over the course of the period of time for this,

3869
02:35:56.16 --> 02:35:58.28
but that a person should not be chained up,

3870
02:35:58.28 --> 02:36:00.24
they should be entitled to the least restrictive setting.

3871
02:36:00.24 --> 02:36:04.64
And so then you also had the notion then coming in

3872
02:36:04.64 --> 02:36:08.08
of SSDI and SSI and these different things

3873
02:36:08.08 --> 02:36:09.96
that started reform as federal movements.

3874
02:36:09.96 --> 02:36:10.80
But people-

3875
02:36:10.80 --> 02:36:13.72
SSDI and SSI. So it's Social Security Disability Income,

3876
02:36:13.72 --> 02:36:16.76
or Social Security Income that came from a federal movement.

3877
02:36:16.76 --> 02:36:19.32
So this part where people who were in inpatient facilities

3878
02:36:19.32 --> 02:36:21.44
at the time were not entitled to those resources.

3879
02:36:21.44 --> 02:36:23.96
And so sort of forced this max,

3880
02:36:23.96 --> 02:36:27.48
this set of exodus, this discharge from hospitals

3881
02:36:27.48 --> 02:36:29.32
for them to be able to receive these services.

3882
02:36:29.32 --> 02:36:30.80
And what you find at that time,

3883
02:36:30.80 --> 02:36:34.04
then it also, some of the states created some laws

3884
02:36:34.04 --> 02:36:35.72
that made it much more difficult for people

3885
02:36:35.72 --> 02:36:38.68
to readmit to inpatient settings.

3886
02:36:38.68 --> 02:36:40.40
So the notion was good, this idea

3887
02:36:40.40 --> 02:36:41.84
that people will do better in the community,

3888
02:36:41.84 --> 02:36:43.84
they'll do better in the least restrictive setting.

3889
02:36:43.84 --> 02:36:46.08
Let's create these resources like SSDI

3890
02:36:46.08 --> 02:36:47.96
and such like that for them.

3891
02:36:47.96 --> 02:36:49.76
However, it sort of flipped its on its head

3892
02:36:49.76 --> 02:36:51.12
in terms of the amount of resources

3893
02:36:51.12 --> 02:36:53.44
that the community wasn't ready to absorb that.

3894
02:36:53.44 --> 02:36:55.20
So what we saw is sometime in some states,

3895
02:36:55.20 --> 02:36:57.32
I think California, I can't remember the year,

3896
02:36:57.32 --> 02:37:01.12
but in the year of sort of discharge of hospitals out

3897
02:37:01.12 --> 02:37:05.12
into we saw the jail population double in California.

3898
02:37:05.12 --> 02:37:06.24
And the homeless population,

3899
02:37:06.24 --> 02:37:08.64
but they think what I recently read

3900
02:37:08.64 --> 02:37:12.04
is something around like 65% of the jails

3901
02:37:12.04 --> 02:37:14.64
are full of people with mental health issues.

3902
02:37:14.64 --> 02:37:16.32
I was talking to a police officer

3903
02:37:16.32 --> 02:37:18.48
a month, month and a half ago,

3904
02:37:18.48 --> 02:37:21.24
and he was just, he had heard that podcast

3905
02:37:21.24 --> 02:37:22.88
and he was like, yeah, he goes,

3906
02:37:22.88 --> 02:37:27.52
I 100% have to arrest people

3907
02:37:27.52 --> 02:37:30.72
and there's no possible way that they belong in jail.

3908
02:37:30.72 --> 02:37:32.88
They belong in some kind of a mental health facility

3909
02:37:32.88 --> 02:37:34.08
and there's nowhere to take them.

3910
02:37:34.08 --> 02:37:35.000
So guess where they go?

3911
02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:35.84
They go to jail.

3912
02:37:35.84 --> 02:37:36.96
Right, right.

3913
02:37:36.96 --> 02:37:38.68
Or they don't go anywhere,

3914
02:37:38.68 --> 02:37:39.52
or they just get,

3915
02:37:39.52 --> 02:37:42.44
they might get go into jail for two nights

3916
02:37:42.44 --> 02:37:43.72
and then they get kicked out,

3917
02:37:43.72 --> 02:37:45.12
but back out on the street

3918
02:37:45.12 --> 02:37:46.84
and they're just deteriorating.

3919
02:37:46.84 --> 02:37:47.92
Well, and if you read about this,

3920
02:37:47.92 --> 02:37:49.36
I mean, depending on where you come from,

3921
02:37:49.36 --> 02:37:51.60
congressman, rulemaker, they're gonna say financial stuff,

3922
02:37:51.60 --> 02:37:53.60
whatever, like everybody has sort of a different

3923
02:37:53.60 --> 02:37:57.28
rationale as to why the institutionalization of the outcome.

3924
02:37:57.28 --> 02:37:59.08
But ultimately what we know is that

3925
02:37:59.08 --> 02:38:01.08
we didn't know anything really around that time

3926
02:38:01.08 --> 02:38:02.88
around complex psychiatric illnesses.

3927
02:38:02.88 --> 02:38:06.84
It was just in the mid 50s at the first,

3928
02:38:06.84 --> 02:38:09.72
like the 1950s, anti-psychotic drug was released.

3929
02:38:09.72 --> 02:38:11.08
Prior to that, it was, you know,

3930
02:38:11.08 --> 02:38:12.04
people with mental illness,

3931
02:38:12.04 --> 02:38:13.48
like they'd never be cured, right?

3932
02:38:13.48 --> 02:38:15.20
There was the myth of mental illness.

3933
02:38:15.20 --> 02:38:16.48
We didn't know too much about it.

3934
02:38:16.48 --> 02:38:19.60
And so I think Thorazine was the first anti-psychotic

3935
02:38:19.60 --> 02:38:21.48
that came out in the 1950s.

3936
02:38:21.48 --> 02:38:22.56
And so at that point it was like,

3937
02:38:22.56 --> 02:38:24.80
oh, well people can get better.

3938
02:38:24.80 --> 02:38:27.16
And that was a very also pivotal movement

3939
02:38:27.16 --> 02:38:28.84
in the de-institutionalization of people

3940
02:38:28.84 --> 02:38:30.72
that historically had been able to be seen as like,

3941
02:38:30.72 --> 02:38:33.20
they just will always need to live in some type of facility.

3942
02:38:33.20 --> 02:38:35.56
It became, oh, we can like do something with this.

3943
02:38:35.56 --> 02:38:37.92
And today obviously there's tons of different things,

3944
02:38:37.92 --> 02:38:41.48
but yeah, it definitely had an impact

3945
02:38:41.48 --> 02:38:43.56
on our homeless and jail population.

3946
02:38:43.56 --> 02:38:46.68
Is there any movement back in the other direction at all?

3947
02:38:48.24 --> 02:38:50.80
I mean, I don't know too much to speak to that part,

3948
02:38:50.80 --> 02:38:52.76
but what I will say about like Anu

3949
02:38:52.76 --> 02:38:54.92
and what Humblechia had been for a very long time

3950
02:38:54.92 --> 02:38:57.000
is it's a very unique model of care

3951
02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.72
that allows for a full continuum of care

3952
02:38:59.72 --> 02:39:03.44
where people can have like a residential setting

3953
02:39:03.44 --> 02:39:06.60
sort of right out of the hospital for a long-term period

3954
02:39:06.60 --> 02:39:08.92
of time and then fluidly move through

3955
02:39:08.92 --> 02:39:11.000
transitional residential for a person

3956
02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.80
to be able to kind of integrate what they need.

3957
02:39:12.80 --> 02:39:14.88
And then also to be able to move back

3958
02:39:14.88 --> 02:39:16.88
into that inpatient setting if they need to.

3959
02:39:16.88 --> 02:39:19.68
And instead of sort of this pattern of,

3960
02:39:19.68 --> 02:39:21.32
I end up in the hospital,

3961
02:39:21.32 --> 02:39:23.68
I get discharged to either home environment

3962
02:39:23.68 --> 02:39:25.48
or a place that's not conducive for me

3963
02:39:25.48 --> 02:39:27.44
to be able to integrate that treatment episode.

3964
02:39:27.44 --> 02:39:30.48
I'm out on the streets or I'm not receiving the care I need

3965
02:39:30.48 --> 02:39:33.000
until I regress again that I've been back in the hospital

3966
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
to utilize all these emergency services.

3967
02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.96
Like, and our model of care really allows people

3968
02:39:37.96 --> 02:39:40.76
to stay long-term in a way that they can move fluidly

3969
02:39:40.76 --> 02:39:42.24
through this and avoid really moving

3970
02:39:42.24 --> 02:39:43.40
into the hospitalizations.

3971
02:39:43.40 --> 02:39:46.40
But it's also, it's a private pay model.

3972
02:39:46.40 --> 02:39:48.16
It's that, you know, insurance is not gonna pay

3973
02:39:48.16 --> 02:39:49.92
for that for folks, right?

3974
02:39:49.92 --> 02:39:52.56
Because, and so folks who are primarily dependent

3975
02:39:52.56 --> 02:39:54.72
on insurance and such like that will find themselves

3976
02:39:54.72 --> 02:39:58.04
in more short-term environments.

3977
02:39:58.04 --> 02:39:59.88
Kind of like crisis intervention.

3978
02:39:59.88 --> 02:40:03.40
Environments which just, it creates kind of a revolving door.

3979
02:40:03.40 --> 02:40:07.12
Right, I'm in crisis, I come in here for a couple of days,

3980
02:40:07.12 --> 02:40:11.60
a couple of hours, maybe a week, stabilize, get out.

3981
02:40:11.60 --> 02:40:13.84
There's nothing available for me once I'm out.

3982
02:40:13.84 --> 02:40:16.36
So I deteriorate and then I come back, right?

3983
02:40:16.36 --> 02:40:18.32
Or I end up in jail because oftentimes people

3984
02:40:18.32 --> 02:40:19.32
with mental illness.

3985
02:40:19.32 --> 02:40:23.04
Versus like the idea with deinstitutionalization

3986
02:40:23.04 --> 02:40:25.36
was this idea of people having more rights,

3987
02:40:25.36 --> 02:40:27.52
more agency, being out in the community,

3988
02:40:27.52 --> 02:40:29.000
not being locked up.

3989
02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:32.32
But then, so kind of, they're released

3990
02:40:32.32 --> 02:40:34.84
to nothing that could hold them.

3991
02:40:34.84 --> 02:40:36.04
So like what you were saying, Megan,

3992
02:40:36.04 --> 02:40:41.000
is a lot of our clients come in from a hospital

3993
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.92
or like could have been in one,

3994
02:40:43.92 --> 02:40:45.56
maybe they've been maintained at home,

3995
02:40:45.56 --> 02:40:46.96
but like not well.

3996
02:40:46.96 --> 02:40:49.24
And it takes, it's like this whole arc,

3997
02:40:49.24 --> 02:40:51.56
it takes a long time to stabilize.

3998
02:40:51.56 --> 02:40:53.92
All the stuff we just talked about with sleep and food

3999
02:40:53.92 --> 02:40:56.76
before we can even get into the nitty gritty of like,

4000
02:40:56.76 --> 02:40:58.60
what is going on here and what needs to happen?

4001
02:40:58.60 --> 02:41:00.36
Let's get you off these 14 meds.

4002
02:41:00.36 --> 02:41:02.20
Let's figure out what was really happening.

4003
02:41:02.20 --> 02:41:03.76
Like this takes a long time.

4004
02:41:03.76 --> 02:41:05.40
So the idea was nice.

4005
02:41:05.40 --> 02:41:08.04
It was like kind of a humane idea,

4006
02:41:08.04 --> 02:41:12.000
but the outside world was not equipped

4007
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:16.24
to receive all of these folks and actually help them.

4008
02:41:16.24 --> 02:41:19.64
So they got worse, deteriorated and then their symptoms

4009
02:41:19.64 --> 02:41:20.72
and then they're getting arrested,

4010
02:41:20.72 --> 02:41:22.12
they're getting picked up.

4011
02:41:22.12 --> 02:41:26.20
You know, you go to drop them off at some emergency room.

4012
02:41:26.20 --> 02:41:27.92
They'll sit in the lobby for a day or two.

4013
02:41:27.92 --> 02:41:29.28
Get some meds.

4014
02:41:29.28 --> 02:41:32.04
There's your meds again and they're out.

4015
02:41:32.04 --> 02:41:35.44
So I would think that the long term hope

4016
02:41:35.44 --> 02:41:37.96
is that this model of treatment,

4017
02:41:37.96 --> 02:41:40.20
which right now is basically for people

4018
02:41:40.20 --> 02:41:42.80
that can afford it and it's expensive,

4019
02:41:42.80 --> 02:41:46.16
is that over time people start to recognize

4020
02:41:46.16 --> 02:41:49.16
this should be a number one,

4021
02:41:49.16 --> 02:41:51.80
a type of treatment that should be covered by insurance.

4022
02:41:51.80 --> 02:41:53.48
And number two, at some point,

4023
02:41:53.48 --> 02:41:56.72
it gets to a situation where the public,

4024
02:41:56.72 --> 02:41:58.76
there can be some public offering

4025
02:41:58.76 --> 02:42:00.56
of treatment centers like this,

4026
02:42:01.56 --> 02:42:03.64
but it's gotta be proven for an even longer.

4027
02:42:03.64 --> 02:42:05.76
I mean, you've already been doing this for how long, Karlyn?

4028
02:42:05.76 --> 02:42:06.60
25 years.

4029
02:42:06.60 --> 02:42:07.44
25 years.

4030
02:42:07.44 --> 02:42:10.72
You've seen incredible successes over those 25 years.

4031
02:42:10.72 --> 02:42:15.40
And yeah, I mean, I hope that as people hear this,

4032
02:42:15.40 --> 02:42:18.84
as people learn more about the methodology that you're using,

4033
02:42:18.84 --> 02:42:21.28
first of all, like just other people in the private sector

4034
02:42:21.28 --> 02:42:23.88
will pick up this type of model and start moving with it.

4035
02:42:23.88 --> 02:42:26.48
And then eventually insurance hopefully starts

4036
02:42:26.48 --> 02:42:28.68
to cover it and then eventually we start saying,

4037
02:42:28.68 --> 02:42:32.16
oh, these homeless people on the street

4038
02:42:32.16 --> 02:42:34.64
that have psychological problems,

4039
02:42:34.64 --> 02:42:36.20
the worst thing we could do is take them,

4040
02:42:36.20 --> 02:42:39.08
throw them in a prison or throw them in a jail for two days

4041
02:42:39.08 --> 02:42:40.36
and kick them back on the street.

4042
02:42:40.36 --> 02:42:41.40
We're just gonna do that.

4043
02:42:41.40 --> 02:42:42.80
It's a never ending cycle.

4044
02:42:42.80 --> 02:42:45.000
To get back to a point where look,

4045
02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.72
do we wanna have people chained up to walls

4046
02:42:47.72 --> 02:42:50.16
and having lobotomies and having electroshock therapy?

4047
02:42:50.16 --> 02:42:51.84
No, obviously we don't.

4048
02:42:51.84 --> 02:42:53.52
That's horrible.

4049
02:42:53.52 --> 02:42:57.84
And I owe an episode on some of those horror shows

4050
02:42:57.84 --> 02:43:00.000
that have taken place in the past.

4051
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:04.36
But to get to a point where there's only 17 beds

4052
02:43:04.36 --> 02:43:06.68
per 100,000 people, I mean,

4053
02:43:06.68 --> 02:43:11.80
you take 100,000 human beings with all the fragility

4054
02:43:11.80 --> 02:43:14.000
of someone's brain and mind

4055
02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.36
and you think you're only gonna need 17 inpatient beds.

4056
02:43:17.36 --> 02:43:20.32
That's a crazy thought and yet that's where we're at.

4057
02:43:20.32 --> 02:43:25.000
So what my hope is, is this model that you all are executing

4058
02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:29.92
starts to be seen as the way to actually help people

4059
02:43:29.92 --> 02:43:33.88
and it can broaden beyond people that can afford

4060
02:43:33.88 --> 02:43:34.72
this type of treatment,

4061
02:43:34.72 --> 02:43:37.20
because this type of treatment is very expensive.

4062
02:43:37.20 --> 02:43:39.60
And we can, number one, get insurance to cover it

4063
02:43:39.60 --> 02:43:42.04
and number two, hopefully eventually get it to a point

4064
02:43:42.04 --> 02:43:44.16
where a model like this can be used

4065
02:43:44.16 --> 02:43:49.16
on a broader public scale that the state can pay for

4066
02:43:49.16 --> 02:43:50.84
if people need it.

4067
02:43:50.84 --> 02:43:53.000
And yeah, like affordable and accessible.

4068
02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.40
And by the way, I just wanna pause

4069
02:43:55.40 --> 02:43:57.60
because you have been a great support to us.

4070
02:43:57.60 --> 02:43:59.80
I mean, not only in the new treatment center,

4071
02:43:59.80 --> 02:44:01.56
but in our previous facilities.

4072
02:44:01.56 --> 02:44:04.28
So like you said in the beginning, coming in is like,

4073
02:44:04.28 --> 02:44:06.44
I just am gonna invest some money here some guys.

4074
02:44:06.44 --> 02:44:10.48
But your contribution and your involvement in that

4075
02:44:10.48 --> 02:44:13.28
and staying involved, I think about seven, eight, nine years

4076
02:44:13.28 --> 02:44:17.64
with our group has helped make this possible.

4077
02:44:17.64 --> 02:44:18.48
So thank you.

4078
02:44:18.48 --> 02:44:20.48
Yeah, absolutely.

4079
02:44:20.48 --> 02:44:22.28
But that would be my hope too, right?

4080
02:44:22.28 --> 02:44:25.88
Is what are the, if you look at any National Institute

4081
02:44:25.88 --> 02:44:28.56
for Mental Health or CDC, one in five people

4082
02:44:28.56 --> 02:44:33.56
has is considered having like kind of a mental health

4083
02:44:33.72 --> 02:44:34.72
experience.

4084
02:44:34.72 --> 02:44:39.12
One in 20 is considered as having like a serious mental

4085
02:44:39.12 --> 02:44:41.84
health diagnosis or condition.

4086
02:44:41.84 --> 02:44:45.48
One in 20, so I don't know the math and 100,000 people.

4087
02:44:45.48 --> 02:44:46.68
How many does that turn out to?

4088
02:44:46.68 --> 02:44:47.96
And we got 17 beds.

4089
02:44:47.96 --> 02:44:50.20
I mean, it's insane.

4090
02:44:50.20 --> 02:44:51.68
Yeah, it's horrible.

4091
02:44:54.04 --> 02:44:55.96
Probably a good place to wrap it up.

4092
02:44:55.96 --> 02:44:57.56
What, did we miss anything?

4093
02:44:59.32 --> 02:45:01.84
Yeah, the one thing I was thinking about earlier

4094
02:45:01.84 --> 02:45:03.40
and you had mentioned scaffolding.

4095
02:45:03.40 --> 02:45:06.96
And again, I think this goes with a lot of your work

4096
02:45:06.96 --> 02:45:09.24
as my understanding of Jocko is this idea of,

4097
02:45:09.24 --> 02:45:11.12
there is a need for external scaffolding.

4098
02:45:11.12 --> 02:45:12.36
Like you said earlier, people like,

4099
02:45:12.36 --> 02:45:13.76
do they like, they don't really want to be there.

4100
02:45:13.76 --> 02:45:14.60
Nope, they don't.

4101
02:45:14.60 --> 02:45:16.12
And in the beginning, that's totally fine.

4102
02:45:16.12 --> 02:45:17.72
We're gonna like scaffold them up

4103
02:45:17.72 --> 02:45:19.48
because internally they're kind of jiggly

4104
02:45:19.48 --> 02:45:21.04
and not really set, right?

4105
02:45:22.20 --> 02:45:25.000
So we're gonna hold them until things can kind of firm

4106
02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:28.12
up a little bit and over time as they're building,

4107
02:45:28.12 --> 02:45:31.12
we pull the external scaffolding back

4108
02:45:31.12 --> 02:45:34.88
because what is happening theoretically is internally,

4109
02:45:34.88 --> 02:45:38.96
their internal scaffolding is taking shape and taking hold.

4110
02:45:38.96 --> 02:45:42.76
So it's very much about helping people access

4111
02:45:42.76 --> 02:45:46.000
their own agency, their own strength, normalizing

4112
02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.20
and saying, yep, I get it today.

4113
02:45:47.20 --> 02:45:49.04
You know what, today is just a rough one.

4114
02:45:49.04 --> 02:45:51.12
That's fine, nothing is wrong with you.

4115
02:45:51.12 --> 02:45:52.44
We're just having one of those days

4116
02:45:52.44 --> 02:45:55.80
and help them develop that internal confidence

4117
02:45:55.80 --> 02:45:57.88
and agency of like self-management,

4118
02:45:57.88 --> 02:45:59.20
even when you have an illness,

4119
02:45:59.20 --> 02:46:02.08
even if you have PTSD, even if you lost your friend.

4120
02:46:02.08 --> 02:46:04.96
Yeah, well, this is the title of the book

4121
02:46:04.96 --> 02:46:06.48
that I wrote, Discipline Equals Freedom.

4122
02:46:06.48 --> 02:46:07.64
It's the exact same thing, right?

4123
02:46:07.64 --> 02:46:11.000
I mean, it's like you put the disciplines in your life

4124
02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:14.68
around waking up, around sticking to a structure,

4125
02:46:14.68 --> 02:46:18.08
around going to get groceries, around showering,

4126
02:46:18.08 --> 02:46:19.28
which you mentioned in it.

4127
02:46:19.28 --> 02:46:21.44
You mentioned it like very quickly,

4128
02:46:21.44 --> 02:46:22.92
you said, I don't know, showering.

4129
02:46:22.92 --> 02:46:24.80
You get people that aren't showering,

4130
02:46:24.80 --> 02:46:26.12
that's an issue, right?

4131
02:46:26.12 --> 02:46:28.64
So we gotta have the discipline to get up,

4132
02:46:28.64 --> 02:46:30.84
to stay on a schedule, to eat good foods,

4133
02:46:30.84 --> 02:46:33.000
to shower, to brush our teeth.

4134
02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.04
And once we get that kind of scaffolding,

4135
02:46:35.04 --> 02:46:37.28
that kind of discipline in place,

4136
02:46:37.28 --> 02:46:40.12
then it becomes internally become self-discipline

4137
02:46:40.12 --> 02:46:43.16
and now we can get more and more freedom as time goes on.

4138
02:46:43.16 --> 02:46:47.64
Why are some good tactics, techniques and procedures

4139
02:46:47.64 --> 02:46:52.64
for getting someone to want to help themselves?

4140
02:46:54.08 --> 02:46:56.64
So I got a family member,

4141
02:46:56.64 --> 02:46:59.48
they're not dealing with reality

4142
02:46:59.48 --> 02:47:02.52
or they're starting to show some of these signs.

4143
02:47:02.52 --> 02:47:06.36
What's a step to take that might be helpful?

4144
02:47:06.36 --> 02:47:08.48
So like I have a book called Extreme Ownership

4145
02:47:08.48 --> 02:47:09.32
and people would say, like,

4146
02:47:09.32 --> 02:47:10.64
why do I get my boss to read it?

4147
02:47:10.64 --> 02:47:12.36
And the worst thing you can do is go to the boss

4148
02:47:12.36 --> 02:47:14.52
and say, hey boss, you need to read this book.

4149
02:47:14.52 --> 02:47:16.56
So we say, oh, you go and say, hey boss,

4150
02:47:16.56 --> 02:47:18.08
I read this book, it really helped me out a lot.

4151
02:47:18.08 --> 02:47:19.48
I'm trying to hold myself to these standards.

4152
02:47:19.48 --> 02:47:21.36
Can you just look at it and if you see me slipping,

4153
02:47:21.36 --> 02:47:22.68
can you type me up?

4154
02:47:22.68 --> 02:47:24.76
You know, a little indirect approach.

4155
02:47:24.76 --> 02:47:27.72
Do you have any recommendations around what to do

4156
02:47:27.72 --> 02:47:30.92
and maybe some recommendations of what not to do?

4157
02:47:30.92 --> 02:47:33.04
Yeah, I mean, I think, for their example,

4158
02:47:33.04 --> 02:47:35.60
consistency is huge and patience too,

4159
02:47:35.60 --> 02:47:37.92
because oftentimes we want people to move

4160
02:47:37.92 --> 02:47:40.12
at the level of our ability to tolerate

4161
02:47:40.12 --> 02:47:40.96
what's going on for them.

4162
02:47:40.96 --> 02:47:42.96
And it's very uncomfortable to see someone struggling.

4163
02:47:42.96 --> 02:47:44.96
It's very uncomfortable to see someone so hopeless.

4164
02:47:44.96 --> 02:47:46.04
You're hearing their narratives.

4165
02:47:46.04 --> 02:47:47.80
You're like, where are you even thinking at?

4166
02:47:47.80 --> 02:47:49.92
And often we want them to move faster

4167
02:47:49.92 --> 02:47:51.000
than they're ready to move.

4168
02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.40
But what you're describing with the framing around the book

4169
02:47:53.40 --> 02:47:54.76
is we plant seeds.

4170
02:47:54.76 --> 02:47:57.04
We create as much structure and consistency

4171
02:47:57.04 --> 02:47:57.88
as we can.

4172
02:47:57.88 --> 02:47:58.72
We plant seeds.

4173
02:47:58.72 --> 02:48:01.24
We help people to kind of be thinking about

4174
02:48:01.24 --> 02:48:03.72
and how this will impact them.

4175
02:48:03.72 --> 02:48:06.04
But every day it's the sort of same conversation

4176
02:48:06.04 --> 02:48:08.32
until they get it and sort of a loving approach with them

4177
02:48:08.32 --> 02:48:11.16
until they get it and being able to tolerate

4178
02:48:11.16 --> 02:48:14.84
what comes up for me when somebody isn't moving at the pace

4179
02:48:14.84 --> 02:48:15.68
that I want them to.

4180
02:48:15.68 --> 02:48:17.28
Because when we're talking about, you know,

4181
02:48:17.28 --> 02:48:19.20
somebody who needs a little pick me up,

4182
02:48:19.20 --> 02:48:20.88
that turnaround might be a lot quicker

4183
02:48:20.88 --> 02:48:23.40
than somebody with a chronic sort of complex disorder.

4184
02:48:23.40 --> 02:48:27.40
And in that case, like, it might take days or months

4185
02:48:27.40 --> 02:48:29.64
before that person gets up and goes showers on their own.

4186
02:48:29.64 --> 02:48:32.04
So can I deal with my own frustration, right?

4187
02:48:32.04 --> 02:48:34.56
Can I deal with my own sense of like helplessness

4188
02:48:34.56 --> 02:48:37.60
and like sense of powerlessness or even inadequacy

4189
02:48:37.60 --> 02:48:38.88
and not being able to like shift?

4190
02:48:38.88 --> 02:48:40.36
Like all these things come up for someone

4191
02:48:40.36 --> 02:48:43.48
when you're loving somebody through something like this.

4192
02:48:43.48 --> 02:48:45.12
But consistency is huge.

4193
02:48:45.12 --> 02:48:47.80
And then remembering that you're not hurting someone

4194
02:48:47.80 --> 02:48:51.000
by trying to hold them in their own discomfort, right?

4195
02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:52.84
So if somebody is uncomfortable,

4196
02:48:52.84 --> 02:48:54.28
but you're helping move them through something

4197
02:48:54.28 --> 02:48:56.76
that's good for them, you're not hurting them.

4198
02:48:56.76 --> 02:48:58.72
Actually, they're experiencing that discomfort

4199
02:48:58.72 --> 02:49:00.08
is going to be really helpful for them.

4200
02:49:00.08 --> 02:49:01.28
It's a very loving thing to do.

4201
02:49:01.28 --> 02:49:03.08
It's a conversation I have with parents often

4202
02:49:03.08 --> 02:49:05.60
about this notion of like hurting in some ways

4203
02:49:05.60 --> 02:49:07.24
when my child is experiencing discomfort.

4204
02:49:07.24 --> 02:49:10.40
No, in fact, like experiencing discomfort in this thing

4205
02:49:10.40 --> 02:49:12.88
is actually really motivating.

4206
02:49:12.88 --> 02:49:14.68
Yes, and amazing for them.

4207
02:49:14.68 --> 02:49:19.08
And it's a super loving thing to do.

4208
02:49:19.08 --> 02:49:22.16
Yeah, and I think it's important to, you know,

4209
02:49:22.16 --> 02:49:25.24
when I talked about, oh, it's normal to go in like,

4210
02:49:25.24 --> 02:49:27.12
hey, you're sad, that's normal.

4211
02:49:27.12 --> 02:49:29.80
Hey, you feel down when you hear this song, that's normal.

4212
02:49:29.80 --> 02:49:34.52
Hey, it's also normal if you've got a kid or a relative

4213
02:49:34.52 --> 02:49:37.88
that's having some issues that you take them

4214
02:49:37.88 --> 02:49:39.64
to the engine shop to get checked out

4215
02:49:39.64 --> 02:49:40.68
and see what's going on.

4216
02:49:40.68 --> 02:49:42.24
Like this is also a normal thing.

4217
02:49:42.24 --> 02:49:46.72
So I think that's another stigma to punch through.

4218
02:49:46.72 --> 02:49:49.68
Anything we should not do, any warnings like,

4219
02:49:49.68 --> 02:49:52.04
hey, that's not a good approach

4220
02:49:52.04 --> 02:49:54.84
when you're trying to get someone to help themselves?

4221
02:49:54.84 --> 02:49:58.20
Well, I think like some of the examples you used earlier,

4222
02:49:58.20 --> 02:50:00.48
and even like when the kids call and ask you questions

4223
02:50:00.48 --> 02:50:02.88
is like the not the shaming stuff.

4224
02:50:02.88 --> 02:50:04.08
Like you said, like, well, what a mom

4225
02:50:04.08 --> 02:50:05.84
who is gonna say something like,

4226
02:50:05.84 --> 02:50:07.20
like, well, why are you doing that?

4227
02:50:07.20 --> 02:50:09.80
You're like, those kind of things aren't typically helpful.

4228
02:50:09.80 --> 02:50:11.36
Cause you know, nobody wants to be ill.

4229
02:50:11.36 --> 02:50:12.72
Nobody wants to have PTSD.

4230
02:50:12.72 --> 02:50:14.04
Nobody wants to have these symptoms.

4231
02:50:14.04 --> 02:50:16.24
So even on the surface, if it looks like,

4232
02:50:16.24 --> 02:50:17.92
why on earth would you do that?

4233
02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.44
They're not doing it to like be difficult or willful

4234
02:50:21.44 --> 02:50:24.000
or to make themselves, you know, worse.

4235
02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.72
So it's easy, it's part of the stigma

4236
02:50:26.72 --> 02:50:28.78
to move into kind of a shaming.

4237
02:50:29.72 --> 02:50:31.44
Why, why did you do that?

4238
02:50:31.44 --> 02:50:33.16
Like that's ridiculous.

4239
02:50:33.16 --> 02:50:36.16
Or you know better than that, like this kind of thing.

4240
02:50:36.16 --> 02:50:38.80
But they, I mean, people will sink, right?

4241
02:50:38.80 --> 02:50:40.80
They kind of cower and sink into that.

4242
02:50:40.80 --> 02:50:44.08
And in some ways might even come to believe

4243
02:50:44.08 --> 02:50:47.96
that I'm weak, I'm incapable, I'm stupid, I'm whatever,

4244
02:50:47.96 --> 02:50:50.60
which is gonna suck the sense of agency.

4245
02:50:50.60 --> 02:50:53.36
So encouragement, still tough luck.

4246
02:50:53.36 --> 02:50:54.72
I mean, it's a blend of all these things.

4247
02:50:54.72 --> 02:50:56.96
Like I'm gonna be kind and respectful,

4248
02:50:56.96 --> 02:50:59.82
also a little bit firm, also let you know

4249
02:50:59.82 --> 02:51:01.76
that I absolutely believe in you.

4250
02:51:01.76 --> 02:51:03.14
And so we're gonna get up right now

4251
02:51:03.14 --> 02:51:03.98
and we're gonna do this thing,

4252
02:51:03.98 --> 02:51:05.48
even though I know you feel really sad.

4253
02:51:05.48 --> 02:51:06.80
Yep.

4254
02:51:06.80 --> 02:51:09.68
Well, and I would say to not disregard your own intuition,

4255
02:51:09.68 --> 02:51:11.74
especially when we're talking about suicide,

4256
02:51:11.74 --> 02:51:13.64
because there's such a,

4257
02:51:13.64 --> 02:51:15.96
there's also could be a self stigma in some ways.

4258
02:51:15.96 --> 02:51:18.96
And so if your intuition has you wondering about something

4259
02:51:18.96 --> 02:51:20.32
or something seemed off with them,

4260
02:51:20.32 --> 02:51:22.32
or oftentimes we can talk ourselves out of that,

4261
02:51:22.32 --> 02:51:24.12
oh, we don't step in other people's business,

4262
02:51:24.12 --> 02:51:25.36
that somebody else's kid,

4263
02:51:25.36 --> 02:51:27.000
or it's not my place to do that,

4264
02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:28.44
or you know, maybe if I bring this up,

4265
02:51:28.44 --> 02:51:30.000
it'll make it worse for them, you know.

4266
02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.44
And so I think trusting our intuition is huge

4267
02:51:32.44 --> 02:51:35.16
if there's a pull in some ways to check in with somebody

4268
02:51:35.16 --> 02:51:36.44
or ask them how they're doing,

4269
02:51:36.44 --> 02:51:39.12
or you notice something that feels off,

4270
02:51:39.12 --> 02:51:40.70
can't tell you how many times,

4271
02:51:40.70 --> 02:51:42.92
especially when we're working in a peer supported environment,

4272
02:51:42.92 --> 02:51:44.42
because we're trying to get folks,

4273
02:51:44.42 --> 02:51:46.16
when we're bringing them into this like,

4274
02:51:46.16 --> 02:51:47.50
housing and they're living together

4275
02:51:47.50 --> 02:51:49.64
to sort of notice each other and take care of each other,

4276
02:51:49.64 --> 02:51:51.76
create their own community and friendships.

4277
02:51:51.76 --> 02:51:54.08
When we see something go kind of sideways with someone,

4278
02:51:54.08 --> 02:51:56.08
or they regress significantly or something happens,

4279
02:51:56.08 --> 02:51:57.36
and you start asking their peers

4280
02:51:57.36 --> 02:51:58.56
sort of what was going on.

4281
02:51:58.56 --> 02:52:01.08
Oftentimes they noticed something,

4282
02:52:01.08 --> 02:52:02.42
but their intuition talked them out of it.

4283
02:52:02.42 --> 02:52:04.48
They'll be mad at me if I hold them accountable.

4284
02:52:04.48 --> 02:52:06.20
You know, I didn't tell everybody

4285
02:52:06.20 --> 02:52:07.96
when I didn't see that they were up for meds

4286
02:52:07.96 --> 02:52:10.000
because I didn't want to like kind of call them out

4287
02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:11.56
or whatever it might be.

4288
02:52:11.56 --> 02:52:13.64
And so I think that, you know,

4289
02:52:13.64 --> 02:52:14.92
trusting our intuition with that

4290
02:52:14.92 --> 02:52:16.54
and like really checking in with people

4291
02:52:16.54 --> 02:52:18.72
and asking important questions,

4292
02:52:18.72 --> 02:52:19.92
and working through our own fears

4293
02:52:19.92 --> 02:52:22.20
that we have related to addressing some of these things

4294
02:52:22.20 --> 02:52:23.92
are super important.

4295
02:52:23.92 --> 02:52:25.64
Your example of like,

4296
02:52:25.64 --> 02:52:26.76
like hey, that's like the fourth time

4297
02:52:26.76 --> 02:52:28.52
you went to the bathroom, the last half an hour, right?

4298
02:52:28.52 --> 02:52:31.68
Imagine like you were saying, if you hadn't said that,

4299
02:52:31.68 --> 02:52:33.80
like what that person would have done in their head

4300
02:52:33.80 --> 02:52:34.68
and how that would have,

4301
02:52:34.68 --> 02:52:37.28
so I think one of the advice, like it's both is,

4302
02:52:37.28 --> 02:52:40.16
say something, say something, call it out, ask a question.

4303
02:52:40.16 --> 02:52:41.76
Hey, like, again, the person might say,

4304
02:52:41.76 --> 02:52:43.64
oh, I'm good, I'm good, don't worry about it, okay.

4305
02:52:43.64 --> 02:52:45.28
But at least you saw them

4306
02:52:45.28 --> 02:52:47.56
and they experienced you seeing them.

4307
02:52:47.56 --> 02:52:48.68
They saw that, you saw them.

4308
02:52:48.68 --> 02:52:50.48
Versus like that blind eye,

4309
02:52:50.48 --> 02:52:52.20
I mean, I think the turning the blind eye,

4310
02:52:52.20 --> 02:52:55.84
not saying the thing, keeping the secrets,

4311
02:52:55.84 --> 02:52:57.92
under the rug is the worst.

4312
02:52:57.92 --> 02:52:59.08
Yeah.

4313
02:52:59.08 --> 02:53:00.04
From a leadership perspective,

4314
02:53:00.04 --> 02:53:02.72
I always often talk about asking Ernest questions

4315
02:53:02.72 --> 02:53:04.96
and how that's a great indirect way

4316
02:53:04.96 --> 02:53:07.96
to let people know that you are watching

4317
02:53:07.96 --> 02:53:09.36
and that you're interested.

4318
02:53:09.36 --> 02:53:11.84
And the key word is Ernest.

4319
02:53:11.84 --> 02:53:15.40
It's not like, hey, I noticed, you've been sad lately.

4320
02:53:16.44 --> 02:53:18.08
What's wrong with you?

4321
02:53:18.08 --> 02:53:20.52
Which is an accusatory question,

4322
02:53:20.52 --> 02:53:21.72
as opposed to being like,

4323
02:53:21.72 --> 02:53:23.88
you know, hey, what are you doing this weekend?

4324
02:53:23.88 --> 02:53:25.32
Like an Ernest question.

4325
02:53:25.32 --> 02:53:27.08
That's an Ernest question, what are you doing this weekend?

4326
02:53:27.08 --> 02:53:27.92
I'm not doing anything.

4327
02:53:27.92 --> 02:53:30.16
Oh, well, what about next weekend?

4328
02:53:30.16 --> 02:53:31.84
I'm not doing anything.

4329
02:53:31.84 --> 02:53:32.68
Do you wanna do something?

4330
02:53:32.68 --> 02:53:34.32
Like, do you wanna go catch a movie?

4331
02:53:34.32 --> 02:53:36.64
You know, so like these kind of Ernest questions

4332
02:53:36.64 --> 02:53:39.36
are a good way to interact with people

4333
02:53:39.36 --> 02:53:41.32
without being accusatory.

4334
02:53:41.32 --> 02:53:43.52
And they might be like, yeah, you know,

4335
02:53:43.52 --> 02:53:44.96
I know I haven't been doing much lately

4336
02:53:44.96 --> 02:53:47.28
because I've been sick for the last few weeks

4337
02:53:47.28 --> 02:53:49.52
and I'm just gonna heal up and you go, okay, cool.

4338
02:53:49.52 --> 02:53:50.52
In which case, cool.

4339
02:53:50.52 --> 02:53:51.64
You can carry on.

4340
02:53:51.64 --> 02:53:53.72
They saw you notice that.

4341
02:53:53.72 --> 02:53:55.64
Yeah, we talk about it as being curious,

4342
02:53:55.64 --> 02:53:56.68
as opposed to accusatory,

4343
02:53:56.68 --> 02:53:59.12
as approaching everything with a certain level of curiosity.

4344
02:53:59.12 --> 02:54:01.000
It'll take you a long way.

4345
02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:02.76
That will do it.

4346
02:54:02.76 --> 02:54:04.52
Megan, any closing thoughts?

4347
02:54:05.96 --> 02:54:08.68
Thank you for having us be here.

4348
02:54:08.68 --> 02:54:10.52
I'm extremely grateful to be a part of this.

4349
02:54:10.52 --> 02:54:13.24
And yes, I mean, I think in terms of the work that we do,

4350
02:54:13.24 --> 02:54:15.60
it takes a special type of person to be able,

4351
02:54:15.60 --> 02:54:17.96
to have this conversation, to talk about this,

4352
02:54:17.96 --> 02:54:20.84
to work with this population, to be a part of it.

4353
02:54:20.84 --> 02:54:22.44
And you're definitely a part of that.

4354
02:54:22.44 --> 02:54:23.60
So thank you.

4355
02:54:23.60 --> 02:54:25.20
Glad to be here, Carla, or anything else?

4356
02:54:25.20 --> 02:54:27.56
Same, thank you for your support.

4357
02:54:27.56 --> 02:54:29.44
If anybody wants to find you,

4358
02:54:29.44 --> 02:54:32.44
the latest and greatest, the new treatment center

4359
02:54:32.44 --> 02:54:34.28
is called a new.

4360
02:54:34.28 --> 02:54:36.12
It's a good play on words you did there.

4361
02:54:36.12 --> 02:54:38.84
A new treatmentcenter.com.

4362
02:54:40.44 --> 02:54:43.32
You're on Instagram, so you're on social media

4363
02:54:43.32 --> 02:54:45.20
with some positivity.

4364
02:54:45.20 --> 02:54:48.40
That's at a new treatment center.

4365
02:54:48.40 --> 02:54:50.16
You're on Facebook, you're on LinkedIn,

4366
02:54:50.16 --> 02:54:51.000
and you're on YouTube.

4367
02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.44
You got your own little YouTube channel going on.

4368
02:54:53.44 --> 02:54:54.28
I've been running.

4369
02:54:54.28 --> 02:54:56.000
I'm a social media part, but I'm really glad

4370
02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:56.84
that's happening.

4371
02:54:56.84 --> 02:54:58.64
And all those are at a new treatment center.

4372
02:54:58.64 --> 02:55:02.32
And I was thinking, you two should do a little podcast,

4373
02:55:02.32 --> 02:55:03.16
by the way.

4374
02:55:03.16 --> 02:55:04.72
I'm just gonna let you know that.

4375
02:55:04.72 --> 02:55:05.56
You should do it.

4376
02:55:05.56 --> 02:55:08.60
You should talk about some cases that you see

4377
02:55:08.60 --> 02:55:11.000
because people will be interested in it.

4378
02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.08
I think it would be very educational.

4379
02:55:13.08 --> 02:55:17.20
And I know I was laughed because Joe Rogan told me

4380
02:55:17.20 --> 02:55:18.84
to start a podcast.

4381
02:55:18.84 --> 02:55:21.56
And at the time I was like, oh, that's pretty cool.

4382
02:55:21.56 --> 02:55:23.36
And then you realize Joe Rogan literally

4383
02:55:23.36 --> 02:55:25.84
had one point in time Joe Rogan told everyone

4384
02:55:25.84 --> 02:55:27.60
on his podcast to start a podcast.

4385
02:55:27.60 --> 02:55:29.08
Because he was super stoked on podcasting.

4386
02:55:29.08 --> 02:55:31.44
Well, you knew he was gonna get it right in one way.

4387
02:55:31.44 --> 02:55:33.44
And a bunch of people have started podcasts,

4388
02:55:33.44 --> 02:55:35.32
but certainly him and Tim Ferriss both told me

4389
02:55:35.32 --> 02:55:36.60
to start a podcast and I listened to him.

4390
02:55:36.60 --> 02:55:39.52
But I think that if you broke it down

4391
02:55:39.52 --> 02:55:41.36
and did some podcasts about some of the things

4392
02:55:41.36 --> 02:55:43.04
that you see, I think it would really be helpful

4393
02:55:43.04 --> 02:55:45.64
for people and would be cool.

4394
02:55:46.48 --> 02:55:47.32
So there you go.

4395
02:55:47.32 --> 02:55:49.20
That's my little recommendation.

4396
02:55:49.20 --> 02:55:51.36
And thanks for joining us.

4397
02:55:51.36 --> 02:55:52.36
Thanks for educating us.

4398
02:55:52.36 --> 02:55:53.56
Thanks for trying to educate me.

4399
02:55:53.56 --> 02:55:56.04
I know it can be challenging sometimes.

4400
02:55:56.04 --> 02:55:58.12
Megan, of course, thanks for your service in the Navy.

4401
02:55:58.12 --> 02:56:02.12
And thanks to both of you for what you're doing today

4402
02:56:02.12 --> 02:56:04.84
to help heal people, help get people to a point

4403
02:56:04.84 --> 02:56:09.04
where they can live productive and happy lives.

4404
02:56:09.04 --> 02:56:12.44
And by the way, if there's any one out there right now

4405
02:56:12.44 --> 02:56:17.44
that's listening, you might not feel great today.

4406
02:56:17.44 --> 02:56:22.44
And you might need to bring the car into the shop

4407
02:56:24.04 --> 02:56:26.28
and get that thing looked at

4408
02:56:26.28 --> 02:56:28.16
and figure out what's going on.

4409
02:56:28.16 --> 02:56:29.52
Nothing wrong with it.

4410
02:56:29.52 --> 02:56:31.64
It's gonna make you better.

4411
02:56:31.64 --> 02:56:33.16
Thanks for doing that, both of you.

4412
02:56:33.16 --> 02:56:34.000
Thank you.

4413
02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:34.84
Appreciate it.

4414
02:56:36.60 --> 02:56:40.12
And with that, Megan and Karlyn have left the building

4415
02:56:40.12 --> 02:56:42.68
and Echo Charles has returned.

4416
02:56:42.68 --> 02:56:43.52
Good evening, Echo.

4417
02:56:43.52 --> 02:56:44.36
Good evening.

4418
02:56:44.36 --> 02:56:46.84
So you were sitting there listening.

4419
02:56:46.84 --> 02:56:47.68
Yes.

4420
02:56:47.68 --> 02:56:52.12
You've been taking the, what, the kind of off-camera

4421
02:56:52.12 --> 02:56:54.36
approach last two podcasts.

4422
02:56:54.36 --> 02:56:57.08
You've been sitting there observing detached.

4423
02:56:57.08 --> 02:56:58.84
Lot going on there, isn't there?

4424
02:56:58.84 --> 02:56:59.68
Yes.

4425
02:56:59.68 --> 02:57:03.28
Lot going on in the mental health world.

4426
02:57:03.28 --> 02:57:04.12
Yeah.

4427
02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.60
Yeah, it's really, it's like a slippery scenario, right?

4428
02:57:07.60 --> 02:57:09.92
Because just like how you get, it's a spectrum.

4429
02:57:09.92 --> 02:57:12.32
It's not like, oh, you're the, you know, like you,

4430
02:57:13.68 --> 02:57:14.68
compared to your body.

4431
02:57:14.68 --> 02:57:16.12
So if you break your arm.

4432
02:57:16.12 --> 02:57:16.96
Yeah.

4433
02:57:16.96 --> 02:57:17.80
It's like, oh yeah, a broken arm.

4434
02:57:17.80 --> 02:57:18.64
Yeah.

4435
02:57:18.64 --> 02:57:19.48
Or maybe you got a fractured arm.

4436
02:57:19.48 --> 02:57:20.32
Mm-hmm.

4437
02:57:20.32 --> 02:57:22.64
And that's sort of, it's kind of a distinct thing.

4438
02:57:22.64 --> 02:57:24.08
Well, a fractured protocol.

4439
02:57:24.08 --> 02:57:25.80
Broken, stress fracture.

4440
02:57:25.80 --> 02:57:26.64
Okay.

4441
02:57:26.64 --> 02:57:27.64
A spiral fracture.

4442
02:57:27.64 --> 02:57:28.48
Okay.

4443
02:57:28.48 --> 02:57:29.64
You know, kind of a thing.

4444
02:57:29.64 --> 02:57:30.72
Pretty limited.

4445
02:57:30.72 --> 02:57:33.80
Like as far as a bone break, you're kind of,

4446
02:57:35.04 --> 02:57:37.32
there's a pretty specific protocol you're gonna follow.

4447
02:57:37.32 --> 02:57:38.16
Hand full of things.

4448
02:57:38.16 --> 02:57:39.56
It's pretty easy to diagnose, right?

4449
02:57:39.56 --> 02:57:42.44
The spectrum isn't this weird, it's the, you know,

4450
02:57:42.44 --> 02:57:44.000
there's guards of gray, you know?

4451
02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
This bone compound fracture or whatever.

4452
02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:47.000
Like there's some differences.

4453
02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:47.84
Oh yeah.

4454
02:57:47.84 --> 02:57:49.44
But we know that a broken bone is a broken bone.

4455
02:57:49.44 --> 02:57:50.28
Here's how we fix it.

4456
02:57:50.28 --> 02:57:51.12
Yeah.

4457
02:57:51.12 --> 02:57:52.28
And then that's not, okay.

4458
02:57:52.28 --> 02:57:54.56
Then compared to the mental part where it's like,

4459
02:57:54.56 --> 02:57:56.72
it's just, it's, it's this spectrum

4460
02:57:56.72 --> 02:57:58.48
and you can fall anywhere on the spectrum.

4461
02:57:58.48 --> 02:57:59.64
By the way, you do fall on.

4462
02:57:59.64 --> 02:58:00.48
Like we all fall on.

4463
02:58:00.48 --> 02:58:01.32
That's what makes it even double.

4464
02:58:01.32 --> 02:58:02.48
That's what makes it interesting.

4465
02:58:02.48 --> 02:58:05.72
That's what really, that's part of what makes it interesting

4466
02:58:05.72 --> 02:58:08.36
to me is like, oh, you're a little bit of a narcissist.

4467
02:58:08.36 --> 02:58:09.72
I'm a little bit of a narcissist.

4468
02:58:09.72 --> 02:58:10.88
I'm a little bit paranoid.

4469
02:58:10.88 --> 02:58:11.80
You're a little bit paranoid.

4470
02:58:11.80 --> 02:58:13.44
How paranoid are you?

4471
02:58:13.44 --> 02:58:14.40
Are you good paranoid?

4472
02:58:14.40 --> 02:58:15.72
Cause there's a certain level of paranoia.

4473
02:58:15.72 --> 02:58:17.04
Like someone that's not paranoid at all

4474
02:58:17.04 --> 02:58:18.16
is just like going through life.

4475
02:58:18.16 --> 02:58:19.48
They can just get taken advantage of.

4476
02:58:19.48 --> 02:58:20.64
You gotta be somewhat paranoid.

4477
02:58:20.64 --> 02:58:21.48
Yeah.

4478
02:58:21.48 --> 02:58:22.32
Delusion.

4479
02:58:22.32 --> 02:58:23.60
So just like the dichotomy of leadership,

4480
02:58:23.60 --> 02:58:28.40
like the dichotomy of your mental status

4481
02:58:28.40 --> 02:58:30.80
is has to be balanced.

4482
02:58:30.80 --> 02:58:31.64
Yeah.

4483
02:58:31.64 --> 02:58:35.40
And that's so, it makes it so clear how helpful it is

4484
02:58:35.40 --> 02:58:40.40
to understand and inversely kind of to express that,

4485
02:58:40.60 --> 02:58:42.64
to people who might be in a certain situation

4486
02:58:42.64 --> 02:58:45.12
that like, hey, that's, that's normal.

4487
02:58:45.12 --> 02:58:46.92
Like there's nothing quote unquote wrong.

4488
02:58:46.92 --> 02:58:48.40
That's normal, you know?

4489
02:58:48.40 --> 02:58:51.88
And so, and that's what makes it even harder to,

4490
02:58:51.88 --> 02:58:53.12
where it's like this bad thing,

4491
02:58:53.12 --> 02:58:54.40
this thing that I don't want, you know,

4492
02:58:54.40 --> 02:58:56.04
like you break your arm, something that you hurt,

4493
02:58:56.04 --> 02:58:58.000
your arm will say, you hurt before you go to the doctor

4494
02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.36
or whatever, you know something's wrong.

4495
02:59:00.36 --> 02:59:01.76
Like this thing is hurting.

4496
02:59:01.76 --> 02:59:03.32
It's not getting better, whatever.

4497
02:59:03.32 --> 02:59:05.04
Let me go to, I know something's wrong.

4498
02:59:05.04 --> 02:59:07.000
So mentally you're gonna feel sad for two days

4499
02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.08
or whatever you feel you have these feelings for two days

4500
02:59:09.08 --> 02:59:10.16
that are normal.

4501
02:59:11.08 --> 02:59:13.24
So it's like harder to, you know, after a while,

4502
02:59:13.24 --> 02:59:15.28
it's like maybe if I'm behaving in a certain way,

4503
02:59:15.28 --> 02:59:17.80
it's like certain symptoms have to kind of arrive

4504
02:59:17.80 --> 02:59:21.04
or arise along with the feeling.

4505
02:59:21.04 --> 02:59:22.96
And it's all like, and if you don't know, you don't know,

4506
02:59:22.96 --> 02:59:24.76
you know, so it's like just so slippery like that.

4507
02:59:24.76 --> 02:59:27.64
I took down a note during the catch 22,

4508
02:59:27.64 --> 02:59:32.68
which basically means cause even with, with,

4509
02:59:32.68 --> 02:59:34.44
Marcus and Amber on the last podcast,

4510
02:59:34.44 --> 02:59:36.56
I was kind of like, you know, I feel fine and like,

4511
02:59:36.56 --> 02:59:37.92
I don't think I need anything, right?

4512
02:59:37.92 --> 02:59:38.84
Someone's telling them.

4513
02:59:38.84 --> 02:59:40.96
And then these guys show up today,

4514
02:59:40.96 --> 02:59:42.96
these girls show up today, these women show up today.

4515
02:59:42.96 --> 02:59:44.08
And I kind of tell them the same thing, you know,

4516
02:59:44.08 --> 02:59:46.000
before we get in here, I'm like, you know,

4517
02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:47.52
I feel like, you know, I'm fine.

4518
02:59:47.52 --> 02:59:52.16
But then one of the, one of the like notifications

4519
02:59:52.16 --> 02:59:54.88
of when you're crazy is when you don't think you're crazy.

4520
02:59:54.88 --> 02:59:55.72
Right?

4521
02:59:55.72 --> 02:59:57.48
So I'm like, oh, I'm that guy that doesn't think he's crazy,

4522
02:59:57.48 --> 02:59:59.48
but I'm actually totally crazy.

4523
02:59:59.48 --> 03:00:01.40
So I thought that was kind of funny

4524
03:00:01.40 --> 03:00:02.32
as I was thinking through that.

4525
03:00:02.32 --> 03:00:04.000
I was like, wait a second, I'm the guy that's in here.

4526
03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.76
I'm fine, but I'm actually crazy.

4527
03:00:06.76 --> 03:00:07.76
Yeah.

4528
03:00:07.76 --> 03:00:08.60
Oh yeah.

4529
03:00:08.60 --> 03:00:09.72
So gotta watch out for that one.

4530
03:00:09.72 --> 03:00:10.64
Yes.

4531
03:00:10.64 --> 03:00:12.94
And we all know people, maybe not a lot,

4532
03:00:12.94 --> 03:00:15.58
but we know people who are like,

4533
03:00:15.58 --> 03:00:19.98
they obviously routinely do things that are just,

4534
03:00:19.98 --> 03:00:21.12
you shouldn't be doing that.

4535
03:00:21.12 --> 03:00:22.72
And they're like, no, no, no, I'm fine.

4536
03:00:22.72 --> 03:00:23.56
I'm fine.

4537
03:00:23.56 --> 03:00:24.40
I'm absolutely fine.

4538
03:00:24.40 --> 03:00:26.04
So you're like, man, am I that guy?

4539
03:00:26.04 --> 03:00:28.92
Just not knowing all the things that I'm doing

4540
03:00:28.92 --> 03:00:30.40
that's not fine, you know?

4541
03:00:31.72 --> 03:00:33.000
So gotta watch out for it.

4542
03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:37.32
But what a, what a fascinating world.

4543
03:00:37.32 --> 03:00:39.12
And as I was doing research for that part,

4544
03:00:39.12 --> 03:00:40.36
and we only got to so much.

4545
03:00:40.36 --> 03:00:42.56
I mean, there's so every one of these things,

4546
03:00:42.56 --> 03:00:44.32
when you open it up, I mean,

4547
03:00:45.24 --> 03:00:50.24
there's a story in like a whole world behind being paranoid.

4548
03:00:51.40 --> 03:00:54.16
And what a really paranoid, or being anorexic.

4549
03:00:54.16 --> 03:00:55.48
What a real, what that looks like.

4550
03:00:55.48 --> 03:00:57.88
Like there's a whole world behind each one of these.

4551
03:00:57.88 --> 03:01:01.24
That's what's interesting, like compared to,

4552
03:01:02.28 --> 03:01:03.60
you know, an orthopedic surgeon.

4553
03:01:03.60 --> 03:01:04.92
Like sure, there's a bunch of different things

4554
03:01:04.92 --> 03:01:07.36
that can go on with a broken arm or with whatever, right?

4555
03:01:07.36 --> 03:01:12.36
But, you know, this is just wildness, you know?

4556
03:01:12.36 --> 03:01:13.36
It's wildness.

4557
03:01:13.36 --> 03:01:16.20
And you remember how you, a long time ago on the podcast,

4558
03:01:16.20 --> 03:01:19.26
you said working out is like the one thing that you can do

4559
03:01:19.26 --> 03:01:21.64
that will positively impact everything that you do.

4560
03:01:21.64 --> 03:01:22.80
I feel that that proved to be right.

4561
03:01:22.80 --> 03:01:24.12
But what's interesting is,

4562
03:01:25.84 --> 03:01:29.88
having a broken arm is gonna impact some parts of your life,

4563
03:01:29.88 --> 03:01:32.40
but it's not gonna impact like everything.

4564
03:01:32.40 --> 03:01:35.76
But if you have some kind of a mental health issue,

4565
03:01:35.76 --> 03:01:39.32
it's like everything is gonna be impacted.

4566
03:01:39.32 --> 03:01:42.32
And again, it's a spectrum where it's like,

4567
03:01:42.32 --> 03:01:44.20
oh, you know what, now I'm kind of like,

4568
03:01:45.16 --> 03:01:46.48
I don't go out as much.

4569
03:01:46.48 --> 03:01:48.40
Cool, that's no big deal, right?

4570
03:01:49.32 --> 03:01:50.40
But then where does it go?

4571
03:01:50.40 --> 03:01:52.56
Like does it, I don't go out much to,

4572
03:01:52.56 --> 03:01:54.36
hey, I'm not gonna go,

4573
03:01:54.36 --> 03:01:56.64
I'm not gonna go to the grocery store,

4574
03:01:56.64 --> 03:01:59.20
to I'm gonna have people drop my food

4575
03:01:59.20 --> 03:02:02.04
at the end of the hallway, to I'm just gonna sit in here

4576
03:02:02.04 --> 03:02:03.60
and like not eat.

4577
03:02:03.60 --> 03:02:07.52
Like it's just, it's very strange.

4578
03:02:07.52 --> 03:02:12.04
And the other thing that I find interesting is just how,

4579
03:02:12.04 --> 03:02:15.28
when I talked to him about how I had said in the academy,

4580
03:02:15.28 --> 03:02:16.92
like we're all insane.

4581
03:02:16.92 --> 03:02:19.24
Everyone's insane, cause your version of reality

4582
03:02:19.24 --> 03:02:20.32
is different than my version of reality.

4583
03:02:20.32 --> 03:02:22.96
And by the way, neither your version or my version

4584
03:02:22.96 --> 03:02:24.56
is actually correct.

4585
03:02:24.56 --> 03:02:27.64
Like what your perception is is not 100% correct,

4586
03:02:27.64 --> 03:02:29.24
my perception is not 100% correct.

4587
03:02:29.24 --> 03:02:32.04
We hope that you and I have a big overlap.

4588
03:02:32.04 --> 03:02:34.48
Like we hope that we have a big, huge overlap.

4589
03:02:34.48 --> 03:02:35.76
And there's like a little bit that I think

4590
03:02:35.76 --> 03:02:37.88
is a little different, a little bit, but that's what we hope.

4591
03:02:37.88 --> 03:02:39.68
And we hope that with most people in our lives,

4592
03:02:39.68 --> 03:02:42.88
most of it is relatively close.

4593
03:02:42.88 --> 03:02:46.04
But the fact is, and also, the fact is

4594
03:02:46.04 --> 03:02:48.32
they're not gonna be perfect and different people.

4595
03:02:48.32 --> 03:02:50.64
Like you can go meet someone today.

4596
03:02:50.64 --> 03:02:53.04
You and I have 97% overlap.

4597
03:02:53.04 --> 03:02:54.76
We can go talk to someone right now

4598
03:02:54.76 --> 03:02:58.08
that we only overlap like 20 or 30% of reality.

4599
03:02:58.08 --> 03:03:00.80
Their reality is just different.

4600
03:03:00.80 --> 03:03:02.92
And that's a real thing.

4601
03:03:02.92 --> 03:03:04.08
That's reality.

4602
03:03:04.08 --> 03:03:07.44
So, it's mayhem out there.

4603
03:03:07.44 --> 03:03:09.40
It is mayhem out there, it's crazy man.

4604
03:03:09.40 --> 03:03:12.40
It's crazy because of how they shed such a clear light

4605
03:03:12.40 --> 03:03:13.92
on how it really works.

4606
03:03:13.92 --> 03:03:15.72
And it's like, man, all this is going on right now.

4607
03:03:15.72 --> 03:03:17.32
Like in my head, in this person,

4608
03:03:17.32 --> 03:03:18.84
in everyone's head around us.

4609
03:03:18.84 --> 03:03:19.80
Holy cow.

4610
03:03:19.80 --> 03:03:21.32
And she'll mention like, or,

4611
03:03:22.52 --> 03:03:24.16
they'll mention like certain things, right?

4612
03:03:24.16 --> 03:03:27.16
Where it reminds you that, hey,

4613
03:03:27.16 --> 03:03:29.40
I didn't really think about this.

4614
03:03:29.40 --> 03:03:31.80
Where like going out, going outside, right?

4615
03:03:31.80 --> 03:03:33.56
I think actually you said it.

4616
03:03:33.56 --> 03:03:34.40
Get outside.

4617
03:03:35.48 --> 03:03:37.40
And not just outside the building,

4618
03:03:37.40 --> 03:03:40.44
I mean, I think anyway, outside and talk to people.

4619
03:03:40.44 --> 03:03:42.60
Talk to different people, be around different people.

4620
03:03:42.60 --> 03:03:45.32
Cause you know, now a lot of my work, quote unquote,

4621
03:03:45.32 --> 03:03:48.08
work is inside in front of the computer

4622
03:03:48.08 --> 03:03:49.72
for long periods of time.

4623
03:03:49.72 --> 03:03:51.16
So then I remember, not recently,

4624
03:03:51.16 --> 03:03:52.12
but this was like years ago,

4625
03:03:52.12 --> 03:03:55.24
where I remember not going outside for a few days.

4626
03:03:55.24 --> 03:03:58.08
Like not going outside of the building in a few days.

4627
03:03:58.08 --> 03:03:58.92
That's not healthy.

4628
03:03:58.92 --> 03:04:00.72
Yeah. And you can feel it too.

4629
03:04:00.72 --> 03:04:02.64
Like after a while, when you kind of are in touch with it,

4630
03:04:02.64 --> 03:04:03.76
like you can feel it.

4631
03:04:03.76 --> 03:04:08.76
Or not used, not, or being, not used to being around people.

4632
03:04:09.08 --> 03:04:10.56
When, okay, I used to work in nightclub

4633
03:04:10.56 --> 03:04:12.16
where you're around people all the time.

4634
03:04:12.16 --> 03:04:16.96
All different dynamic spectrum of people all the time.

4635
03:04:16.96 --> 03:04:18.64
Positive negative everybody.

4636
03:04:19.52 --> 03:04:21.32
And then, you know, working inside

4637
03:04:21.32 --> 03:04:23.04
where you're not around a lot of people.

4638
03:04:23.04 --> 03:04:24.76
Like I can totally tell the difference.

4639
03:04:24.76 --> 03:04:25.76
Like the idea of me,

4640
03:04:25.76 --> 03:04:27.48
and this might have to do with age too, by the way,

4641
03:04:27.48 --> 03:04:30.20
but the idea of going down

4642
03:04:30.20 --> 03:04:32.92
and dealing with the crowd of a nightclub or something.

4643
03:04:32.92 --> 03:04:33.76
Doesn't appeal to you.

4644
03:04:33.76 --> 03:04:35.08
On any night is like,

4645
03:04:35.08 --> 03:04:37.48
that is one of the last things I'd want to do.

4646
03:04:37.48 --> 03:04:38.32
And then when I compare,

4647
03:04:38.32 --> 03:04:39.56
especially when I compare it to like,

4648
03:04:39.56 --> 03:04:42.64
how I was kind of down with that long time ago, you know?

4649
03:04:42.64 --> 03:04:44.64
And so you take that idea and do it

4650
03:04:44.64 --> 03:04:45.88
and just apply it to everyday life.

4651
03:04:45.88 --> 03:04:47.44
I know nightclub and all that stuff is different,

4652
03:04:47.44 --> 03:04:48.28
little bit different.

4653
03:04:48.28 --> 03:04:49.32
But in everyday life,

4654
03:04:49.32 --> 03:04:50.96
if you're used to going out to the store

4655
03:04:50.96 --> 03:04:52.12
or going out to this and that,

4656
03:04:52.12 --> 03:04:55.12
and then you don't go outside for a long time,

4657
03:04:55.12 --> 03:04:56.80
or you just simply alone,

4658
03:04:56.80 --> 03:04:59.000
you just don't go outside for a long time.

4659
03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.28
Starting to go outside and dealing with like people

4660
03:05:01.28 --> 03:05:04.12
or the public becomes more and more challenging,

4661
03:05:04.12 --> 03:05:05.28
just cause you're not used to it,

4662
03:05:05.28 --> 03:05:07.84
just like any kind of exercise you do.

4663
03:05:07.84 --> 03:05:08.68
So I'm saying,

4664
03:05:08.68 --> 03:05:12.48
and I can understand even more now.

4665
03:05:12.48 --> 03:05:14.12
How that window shuts.

4666
03:05:14.12 --> 03:05:16.32
Yeah, and how that can jam you up mentally.

4667
03:05:17.56 --> 03:05:19.44
It doesn't seem like you're made for that kind of stuff.

4668
03:05:19.44 --> 03:05:21.56
You know, just being isolated.

4669
03:05:21.56 --> 03:05:23.36
And then you're stuck with the internet all the time.

4670
03:05:23.36 --> 03:05:25.20
Oh man, brother, brother, you gotta watch out.

4671
03:05:25.20 --> 03:05:26.40
You see that internet conversation

4672
03:05:26.40 --> 03:05:27.76
could be a five hour conversation.

4673
03:05:27.76 --> 03:05:28.92
Oh yeah.

4674
03:05:28.92 --> 03:05:31.76
Cause it's mayhem out there on the internet.

4675
03:05:31.76 --> 03:05:33.28
And if you have that little belief,

4676
03:05:33.28 --> 03:05:38.28
I mean, look, if you believe that veganism

4677
03:05:39.96 --> 03:05:41.28
is the best thing for you,

4678
03:05:41.28 --> 03:05:42.60
that you can go insane.

4679
03:05:42.60 --> 03:05:45.28
If you believe that the carnivore died

4680
03:05:45.28 --> 03:05:46.28
is about you can go insane.

4681
03:05:46.28 --> 03:05:49.16
If you believe like whatever weird belief

4682
03:05:49.16 --> 03:05:50.64
that you wanna have,

4683
03:05:50.64 --> 03:05:51.88
and you wanna jump on the internet

4684
03:05:51.88 --> 03:05:53.24
and you wanna read into that thing.

4685
03:05:53.24 --> 03:05:54.08
Bruh.

4686
03:05:54.08 --> 03:05:59.08
You gotta watch out, man.

4687
03:06:00.08 --> 03:06:02.60
Don't get off that internet, man.

4688
03:06:02.60 --> 03:06:04.28
It's gonna jack you up.

4689
03:06:04.28 --> 03:06:06.84
And the weird thing is when I tell you,

4690
03:06:06.84 --> 03:06:08.96
if I'm like, echo dude, you gotta get off the internet.

4691
03:06:08.96 --> 03:06:12.20
You gotta stop reading about, you know, carnivore diet.

4692
03:06:12.20 --> 03:06:13.76
You be like, oh, you just want me to keep eating

4693
03:06:13.76 --> 03:06:15.48
the mainstream diet.

4694
03:06:15.48 --> 03:06:16.88
It's like that, you see?

4695
03:06:16.88 --> 03:06:20.52
It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

4696
03:06:20.52 --> 03:06:23.08
So you gotta get yourself out of the algorithm.

4697
03:06:23.08 --> 03:06:24.56
Just watch out.

4698
03:06:24.56 --> 03:06:29.56
Hey, that being said, one thing that we did talk about today

4699
03:06:29.60 --> 03:06:34.60
was being healthy, eating the right foods, working out.

4700
03:06:35.32 --> 03:06:37.76
This is coming from two people in the industry

4701
03:06:37.76 --> 03:06:39.56
for a quarter, well, between them,

4702
03:06:39.56 --> 03:06:41.64
it's probably, I don't know, 50 years or something.

4703
03:06:41.64 --> 03:06:43.68
They got a lot of experience in this industry.

4704
03:06:43.68 --> 03:06:48.20
And I made fun of Rogan and me saying like,

4705
03:06:48.20 --> 03:06:50.16
oh, you should work out.

4706
03:06:50.16 --> 03:06:51.08
I kinda made fun of it.

4707
03:06:51.08 --> 03:06:53.04
And they're like, actually, it's true.

4708
03:06:53.04 --> 03:06:56.68
Work out, eat right, stay on the path.

4709
03:06:56.68 --> 03:06:58.36
It's gonna help you in everything that you do.

4710
03:06:58.36 --> 03:07:02.56
So get yourself some good, let's say, supplementation.

4711
03:07:02.56 --> 03:07:04.44
Yes, to help with that work out.

4712
03:07:04.44 --> 03:07:05.60
And that's the thing, actually,

4713
03:07:05.60 --> 03:07:06.84
you're probably in this boat too, where you-

4714
03:07:06.84 --> 03:07:07.96
Segway just occurred.

4715
03:07:07.96 --> 03:07:09.08
You're welcome, everybody.

4716
03:07:09.08 --> 03:07:12.12
Yeah, that's the perfect chance.

4717
03:07:12.12 --> 03:07:13.32
But you probably like this too,

4718
03:07:13.32 --> 03:07:15.000
where you pretty much worked out your whole life,

4719
03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:16.04
probably, right?

4720
03:07:16.04 --> 03:07:20.12
Yeah, I really didn't start legitimately working out

4721
03:07:20.12 --> 03:07:21.92
until I was like,

4722
03:07:21.92 --> 03:07:25.04
first of all, because working out wasn't really a thing.

4723
03:07:25.04 --> 03:07:26.08
I mean, it really wasn't.

4724
03:07:26.08 --> 03:07:29.84
Like, there was no, I'm one of my five years older than you.

4725
03:07:29.84 --> 03:07:34.000
So like, yes, did we have Joe Weider's

4726
03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.76
superweight gain back in like 1985?

4727
03:07:36.76 --> 03:07:37.92
Yes, we did.

4728
03:07:37.92 --> 03:07:40.88
But we didn't understand, at least where I was.

4729
03:07:40.88 --> 03:07:45.64
I mean, look, maybe if I'd have been at some bigger school,

4730
03:07:45.64 --> 03:07:46.92
cause I was in like a little school,

4731
03:07:46.92 --> 03:07:48.36
like there was a YMCA and there was a,

4732
03:07:48.36 --> 03:07:49.96
there was bumper plates in there.

4733
03:07:49.96 --> 03:07:51.72
But like, I had no idea what.

4734
03:07:51.72 --> 03:07:54.32
I remember there was a blind guy

4735
03:07:54.32 --> 03:07:56.24
that would Olympic lift.

4736
03:07:56.24 --> 03:07:59.92
And I actually thought at the time it was cause,

4737
03:07:59.92 --> 03:08:02.80
like that was what he was limited to.

4738
03:08:02.80 --> 03:08:04.28
I thought, well, you know, he can't really see,

4739
03:08:04.28 --> 03:08:07.36
so he just stays in this one spot and just lifts that one bar.

4740
03:08:07.36 --> 03:08:09.92
He doesn't know how to use the freaking peck deck.

4741
03:08:11.36 --> 03:08:12.40
You know what I'm saying?

4742
03:08:12.40 --> 03:08:14.76
So yes, I guess I have been working out for a while.

4743
03:08:14.76 --> 03:08:15.60
Yeah.

4744
03:08:15.60 --> 03:08:19.48
So we, and so you weren't like a jock.

4745
03:08:19.48 --> 03:08:20.84
You were a jock-o, but you were just.

4746
03:08:20.84 --> 03:08:22.84
I definitely was not like a jock,

4747
03:08:22.84 --> 03:08:26.24
although I played soccer and basketball.

4748
03:08:26.24 --> 03:08:27.08
Every year.

4749
03:08:27.08 --> 03:08:27.92
Yep.

4750
03:08:27.92 --> 03:08:28.76
Oh, okay.

4751
03:08:28.76 --> 03:08:29.60
So yeah, yeah.

4752
03:08:29.60 --> 03:08:31.04
So to me, that is working out.

4753
03:08:31.04 --> 03:08:33.64
So, especially if you took it even this much seriously.

4754
03:08:33.64 --> 03:08:36.32
So consider, and I'll use myself as an example.

4755
03:08:36.32 --> 03:08:39.72
So when I was 11 years old, I started actual sports.

4756
03:08:40.96 --> 03:08:42.04
So you play football.

4757
03:08:42.04 --> 03:08:43.28
But you got into push-ups, right?

4758
03:08:43.28 --> 03:08:44.12
I remember you.

4759
03:08:44.12 --> 03:08:44.96
Push-ups.

4760
03:08:44.96 --> 03:08:46.36
And so I always thought that having big muscles was cool.

4761
03:08:46.36 --> 03:08:47.20
Yes.

4762
03:08:47.20 --> 03:08:49.28
So, so I would do that kind of stuff.

4763
03:08:49.28 --> 03:08:50.12
Yes, for sure.

4764
03:08:50.12 --> 03:08:52.76
When you reach puberty, 13, 14,

4765
03:08:52.76 --> 03:08:55.60
probably like 15 years old, we started lifting weights.

4766
03:08:55.60 --> 03:08:58.16
So, man, from there, it was on.

4767
03:08:58.16 --> 03:09:00.96
It was all one big program indefinitely.

4768
03:09:00.96 --> 03:09:02.12
Till now.

4769
03:09:02.12 --> 03:09:03.76
Till literally right now today.

4770
03:09:03.76 --> 03:09:04.72
Till this morning.

4771
03:09:04.72 --> 03:09:05.56
Yes, sir.

4772
03:09:05.56 --> 03:09:06.40
Yes.

4773
03:09:06.40 --> 03:09:08.48
So, and this is how it works.

4774
03:09:08.48 --> 03:09:09.92
Essentially, if you care about sports,

4775
03:09:09.92 --> 03:09:11.80
care about your performance in sports, which we did.

4776
03:09:11.80 --> 03:09:14.64
So you go on season, obviously you're practicing every day,

4777
03:09:14.64 --> 03:09:16.000
football and track, that's what we did.

4778
03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:17.32
So football is one season,

4779
03:09:17.32 --> 03:09:20.20
once football is over, get ready for track.

4780
03:09:20.20 --> 03:09:22.24
Between that set, you're lifting weight.

4781
03:09:22.24 --> 03:09:25.08
So yeah, you're just going from one sport

4782
03:09:25.08 --> 03:09:27.08
to lifting and conditioning to the next sport,

4783
03:09:27.08 --> 03:09:29.52
lifting and conditioning, and back and forth years

4784
03:09:29.52 --> 03:09:30.60
through college.

4785
03:09:31.96 --> 03:09:34.20
And then after college, it was just lifting.

4786
03:09:34.20 --> 03:09:35.56
And then when I got into Jiu-Jitsu,

4787
03:09:35.56 --> 03:09:37.96
okay, now it's lifting and conditioning for Jiu-Jitsu,

4788
03:09:37.96 --> 03:09:39.32
tournaments, all this stuff.

4789
03:09:39.32 --> 03:09:42.000
So essentially being on the program,

4790
03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:43.80
on the path from a physical standpoint,

4791
03:09:43.80 --> 03:09:44.96
is has been.

4792
03:09:44.96 --> 03:09:45.80
In the long term, decades.

4793
03:09:45.80 --> 03:09:50.64
Yeah, but as a result, it is served as like an anchor.

4794
03:09:50.64 --> 03:09:54.60
So, you know, the idea of like not working out.

4795
03:09:54.60 --> 03:09:55.44
It's not a thing.

4796
03:09:55.44 --> 03:09:57.32
Like, oh, he just quit working out.

4797
03:09:57.32 --> 03:09:59.84
Like, bro, man, it's hard to relate,

4798
03:09:59.84 --> 03:10:02.12
even though it's so common.

4799
03:10:02.12 --> 03:10:06.52
So yeah, I think if you can anchor that, the workout,

4800
03:10:06.52 --> 03:10:10.12
like my physical health is like an anchor, a given.

4801
03:10:10.12 --> 03:10:11.04
And it should be,

4802
03:10:11.04 --> 03:10:13.68
because if your physical health falls apart,

4803
03:10:13.68 --> 03:10:16.56
like it's gonna negatively impact everything else.

4804
03:10:16.56 --> 03:10:18.52
Now look, you can get sick, and guess what?

4805
03:10:18.52 --> 03:10:20.72
When you do get sick, if you get sick,

4806
03:10:20.72 --> 03:10:23.24
it is still gonna negatively impact everything else.

4807
03:10:23.24 --> 03:10:26.32
But there's sicknesses you don't have an option on, right?

4808
03:10:26.32 --> 03:10:29.88
Like you get hit with some horrible cancer out of nowhere.

4809
03:10:29.88 --> 03:10:31.32
Like what are you gonna do about that?

4810
03:10:31.32 --> 03:10:32.96
Well, you know, you go through the protocol,

4811
03:10:32.96 --> 03:10:34.80
you try and stay positive.

4812
03:10:34.80 --> 03:10:36.60
But a lot of people,

4813
03:10:36.60 --> 03:10:38.84
they don't get hit with something they can't control.

4814
03:10:38.84 --> 03:10:42.40
They get hit with the one thing they can control.

4815
03:10:42.40 --> 03:10:46.88
And they let it slide, which is freaking horrible to see.

4816
03:10:46.88 --> 03:10:48.28
So let's not let it slide.

4817
03:10:48.28 --> 03:10:50.20
Yep, get on there.

4818
03:10:50.20 --> 03:10:51.48
And yeah, take your supplements.

4819
03:10:51.48 --> 03:10:52.32
That helps it.

4820
03:10:52.32 --> 03:10:53.68
That helps the physical part.

4821
03:10:53.68 --> 03:10:54.52
So you're saying, Joc,

4822
03:10:54.52 --> 03:10:56.16
cause these goods are functional.

4823
03:10:56.16 --> 03:10:58.48
This is the line of supplements I wish I always had.

4824
03:10:58.48 --> 03:10:59.52
Yeah.

4825
03:10:59.52 --> 03:11:01.40
That could have been a game changer actually.

4826
03:11:01.40 --> 03:11:04.28
If we were to have these supplements our whole lives.

4827
03:11:04.28 --> 03:11:05.12
Yeah.

4828
03:11:05.12 --> 03:11:05.96
A whole different story.

4829
03:11:05.96 --> 03:11:07.30
A whole different story.

4830
03:11:07.30 --> 03:11:10.24
Let's face it, we navigate our supplement experience

4831
03:11:10.24 --> 03:11:11.32
very ignorantly.

4832
03:11:11.32 --> 03:11:14.48
You know, the best advertisement wins straight up.

4833
03:11:14.48 --> 03:11:16.06
Like, hey, you see a buff guy on there

4834
03:11:16.06 --> 03:11:18.40
saying freaking 100 grams of protein first scoop.

4835
03:11:18.40 --> 03:11:22.64
You see a guy that's freaking juiced to the absolute gills.

4836
03:11:22.64 --> 03:11:23.48
Yes.

4837
03:11:23.48 --> 03:11:24.32
Oh yeah.

4838
03:11:24.32 --> 03:11:26.40
And you know, so that's, that's all we're gonna get.

4839
03:11:26.40 --> 03:11:27.80
And he's like, yeah.

4840
03:11:27.80 --> 03:11:30.28
I take Frank and whatever.

4841
03:11:30.28 --> 03:11:32.08
And they come up with these crazy days.

4842
03:11:32.08 --> 03:11:34.16
Mega mass, I forget the number.

4843
03:11:34.16 --> 03:11:35.88
I think it was 5,000.

4844
03:11:36.80 --> 03:11:38.48
Mega, brother, that tasted kind of good.

4845
03:11:38.48 --> 03:11:39.32
It was in a big dog food bag.

4846
03:11:39.32 --> 03:11:41.32
It was a food bag.

4847
03:11:41.32 --> 03:11:42.16
For weight gain, mega mass 5,000.

4848
03:11:42.16 --> 03:11:43.000
Like just get some.

4849
03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:43.84
Oh yeah.

4850
03:11:43.84 --> 03:11:45.20
And that's, but so yeah.

4851
03:11:45.20 --> 03:11:47.16
Now we know, Brad, it's not like that.

4852
03:11:47.16 --> 03:11:48.52
You gotta take the correct stuff,

4853
03:11:48.52 --> 03:11:52.90
made with the correct stuff, for the correct stuff.

4854
03:11:52.90 --> 03:11:53.80
So yeah, we're doing that.

4855
03:11:53.80 --> 03:11:55.08
We got joint stuff.

4856
03:11:55.08 --> 03:11:56.32
Mulk, which is the protein.

4857
03:11:56.32 --> 03:11:59.44
That's the protein we should have had back in the day.

4858
03:11:59.44 --> 03:12:02.72
Not this mega sugar, one million or whatever it was before.

4859
03:12:02.72 --> 03:12:03.80
It seemed to me.

4860
03:12:03.80 --> 03:12:06.20
The energy drinks, Jocco, Go.

4861
03:12:06.20 --> 03:12:07.16
Yep.

4862
03:12:07.16 --> 03:12:08.88
The first, maybe not the first.

4863
03:12:08.88 --> 03:12:09.72
I don't know.

4864
03:12:09.72 --> 03:12:10.56
I have no idea.

4865
03:12:10.56 --> 03:12:12.68
Fully healthy energy drink.

4866
03:12:12.68 --> 03:12:13.52
Yeah.

4867
03:12:13.52 --> 03:12:15.04
The kind you drink one, you're healthier.

4868
03:12:15.04 --> 03:12:15.88
You're healthier.

4869
03:12:15.88 --> 03:12:16.92
You just got better.

4870
03:12:16.92 --> 03:12:17.76
You just got better.

4871
03:12:17.76 --> 03:12:19.60
You know, like, oh, good health came into can.

4872
03:12:19.60 --> 03:12:20.76
Everyone was like, oh yeah, it does.

4873
03:12:20.76 --> 03:12:21.60
There you go.

4874
03:12:21.60 --> 03:12:22.44
It does.

4875
03:12:22.44 --> 03:12:23.92
Well, one third of it, same saying.

4876
03:12:23.92 --> 03:12:24.76
One third.

4877
03:12:24.76 --> 03:12:26.24
Nutrition, exercise, rest.

4878
03:12:26.24 --> 03:12:27.56
That's the trio.

4879
03:12:27.56 --> 03:12:29.40
Oh, look at you over there.

4880
03:12:29.40 --> 03:12:30.76
I'm gonna throw that rest at me.

4881
03:12:30.76 --> 03:12:31.76
Gotta be.

4882
03:12:32.96 --> 03:12:35.24
JoccoFuel.com, you can get all this good stuff for you.

4883
03:12:35.24 --> 03:12:36.08
You can support the podcast.

4884
03:12:36.08 --> 03:12:36.92
You can support yourself.

4885
03:12:36.92 --> 03:12:37.76
You can be healthy.

4886
03:12:37.76 --> 03:12:40.000
You can help your mental health.

4887
03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:40.84
Right?

4888
03:12:40.84 --> 03:12:42.48
We just did a freaking three hours on mental health.

4889
03:12:42.48 --> 03:12:45.36
Help your mental health by helping your physical health.

4890
03:12:45.36 --> 03:12:47.16
You can get the drinks at Wawa.

4891
03:12:47.16 --> 03:12:52.16
We got October 3rd, I think the Moq RTD hits Wawa.

4892
03:12:52.92 --> 03:12:54.16
Get in there.

4893
03:12:54.16 --> 03:12:55.12
Get yourself some banana.

4894
03:12:55.12 --> 03:12:56.28
Get yourself some chocolate.

4895
03:12:56.28 --> 03:12:58.92
Get yourself some vanilla.

4896
03:12:58.92 --> 03:13:00.92
The best you can get.

4897
03:13:00.92 --> 03:13:03.000
The best, the best, the highest quality.

4898
03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.68
Look, we are not cutting corners.

4899
03:13:05.68 --> 03:13:07.72
And believe me, people want you to cut corners.

4900
03:13:07.72 --> 03:13:10.44
They wanna make an extra seven cents.

4901
03:13:10.44 --> 03:13:11.28
Nope.

4902
03:13:11.28 --> 03:13:14.92
We could get an extra seven cents out of every sale.

4903
03:13:14.92 --> 03:13:15.76
Per unit.

4904
03:13:15.76 --> 03:13:16.60
Yeah.

4905
03:13:16.60 --> 03:13:20.40
If you put, if you don't use a natural sweetener,

4906
03:13:20.40 --> 03:13:22.76
if you use something that's bad for you,

4907
03:13:22.76 --> 03:13:25.16
cool, I made more money off your health.

4908
03:13:25.16 --> 03:13:26.52
No, we're not doing that.

4909
03:13:26.52 --> 03:13:27.92
We are keeping healthy.

4910
03:13:27.92 --> 03:13:30.72
JoccoFuel.com, Wawa, Vitamin Shop,

4911
03:13:31.96 --> 03:13:35.68
HEB down in Texas, bunch of different places.

4912
03:13:35.68 --> 03:13:38.40
If they don't have it where you shop, ask them for it.

4913
03:13:38.40 --> 03:13:39.32
We'll get it to you.

4914
03:13:40.48 --> 03:13:44.12
OriginUSA.com, we're doing Jiu Jitsu.

4915
03:13:44.12 --> 03:13:46.28
Which means you need a gi.

4916
03:13:46.28 --> 03:13:49.08
You might as well get the best possible gi in the world.

4917
03:13:49.08 --> 03:13:54.08
Go to originUSA.com, get yourself the best made gi

4918
03:13:54.08 --> 03:13:56.08
and it's made in America, just like the jeans.

4919
03:13:56.08 --> 03:13:58.52
Just like the boots.

4920
03:14:00.60 --> 03:14:02.000
Awesome stuff.

4921
03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:03.60
The Hunt Gear.

4922
03:14:03.60 --> 03:14:05.32
OriginUSA.com.

4923
03:14:05.32 --> 03:14:07.24
Don't forget that we, don't we have a store?

4924
03:14:07.24 --> 03:14:08.28
We do have a store.

4925
03:14:08.28 --> 03:14:09.12
And what's that called?

4926
03:14:09.12 --> 03:14:10.88
It's called Jocco Store.

4927
03:14:10.88 --> 03:14:14.12
Again, the discipline equals freedom standard issue.

4928
03:14:14.12 --> 03:14:15.28
T-shirt is out.

4929
03:14:15.28 --> 03:14:16.96
We made the announcement.

4930
03:14:16.96 --> 03:14:20.24
Made it yesterday to the people and you know, good response.

4931
03:14:20.24 --> 03:14:22.08
It's a good, it's a good standard issue shirt.

4932
03:14:22.08 --> 03:14:25.40
I saw you put a YouTube video up of the shirt locker.

4933
03:14:25.40 --> 03:14:27.44
Yeah, kinda updated.

4934
03:14:27.44 --> 03:14:28.56
Oh, is it an updated one?

4935
03:14:28.56 --> 03:14:30.08
A little bit, yeah.

4936
03:14:30.08 --> 03:14:31.92
It's pretty cool, quite frankly.

4937
03:14:31.92 --> 03:14:35.20
Yeah, it's a metaphorical, it's metaphorical.

4938
03:14:35.20 --> 03:14:39.000
It's a metaphor for the shirt locker.

4939
03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:40.28
Oh, cause my shirt's changing?

4940
03:14:40.28 --> 03:14:42.92
Yeah, you know, people, I read the comments.

4941
03:14:42.92 --> 03:14:45.04
That's not the deepest metaphor.

4942
03:14:45.04 --> 03:14:46.32
I read some of the comments, they're like,

4943
03:14:46.32 --> 03:14:48.08
oh, how do you make a shirt change

4944
03:14:48.08 --> 03:14:49.48
when you didn't even take it off or whatever.

4945
03:14:49.48 --> 03:14:50.32
See what I'm saying?

4946
03:14:50.32 --> 03:14:51.60
So I'm saying, hey, it's a metaphor.

4947
03:14:51.60 --> 03:14:52.72
It's a metaphor.

4948
03:14:52.72 --> 03:14:55.20
You wear a shirt, it changes every month.

4949
03:14:56.32 --> 03:14:57.16
Boom.

4950
03:14:57.16 --> 03:14:58.48
It doesn't really change on your body

4951
03:14:58.48 --> 03:15:00.12
the way it does in the video, see what I'm saying?

4952
03:15:00.12 --> 03:15:02.48
You're wearing one of these shirt locker shirts right now.

4953
03:15:02.48 --> 03:15:03.32
Is that right?

4954
03:15:03.32 --> 03:15:04.32
Yes, yeah, it is.

4955
03:15:04.32 --> 03:15:05.80
The G.I. Joe one.

4956
03:15:05.80 --> 03:15:06.76
G.I. Joe rip.

4957
03:15:06.76 --> 03:15:09.96
Most recent one is called toxic productivity.

4958
03:15:09.96 --> 03:15:10.80
It's a good one.

4959
03:15:11.92 --> 03:15:13.28
It's a good one, very good.

4960
03:15:13.28 --> 03:15:17.000
These cartoonish pictures that you're utilizing of me,

4961
03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:17.84
by the way.

4962
03:15:18.68 --> 03:15:20.56
Cartoonish pictures of me.

4963
03:15:20.56 --> 03:15:21.40
Comic book.

4964
03:15:21.40 --> 03:15:23.12
Comic book pictures of me.

4965
03:15:23.12 --> 03:15:27.44
Like holding a weapon in each hand,

4966
03:15:27.44 --> 03:15:28.76
riding a tank.

4967
03:15:32.04 --> 03:15:33.24
That's funny stuff.

4968
03:15:33.24 --> 03:15:36.08
Yeah, there's actually a lot of good designs on there.

4969
03:15:37.52 --> 03:15:39.60
I don't know if they come up for.

4970
03:15:39.60 --> 03:15:43.16
Sometimes people request certain types of designs.

4971
03:15:43.16 --> 03:15:45.24
We go down a rabbit hole looking into it,

4972
03:15:45.24 --> 03:15:46.68
the viability of certain ones.

4973
03:15:46.68 --> 03:15:48.76
And some of them is just real obvious

4974
03:15:48.76 --> 03:15:50.80
that just need to be made into shirts.

4975
03:15:50.80 --> 03:15:52.76
So, but it's fun.

4976
03:15:52.76 --> 03:15:54.000
Anyway, that's called the shirt locker.

4977
03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:56.12
One shirt, a new shirt every month.

4978
03:15:56.12 --> 03:15:57.40
Cool thing, people seem to like it.

4979
03:15:57.40 --> 03:15:58.24
Check that out.

4980
03:15:58.24 --> 03:15:59.40

03:16:04.48 --> 03:16:07.08
People getting pulled off of platforms.

4985
03:16:07.08 --> 03:16:08.32
We don't own this platform.

4986
03:16:08.32 --> 03:16:11.32
Look, are we talking about some crazy controversial thing?

4987
03:16:11.32 --> 03:16:12.72
Not really.

4988
03:16:12.72 --> 03:16:13.72
Do we talk about some things

4989
03:16:13.72 --> 03:16:15.96
that maybe could get us put in a situation?

4990
03:16:15.96 --> 03:16:16.80
Yes, we do.

4991
03:16:16.80 --> 03:16:21.08
We have, we've had warnings on some of our YouTube videos

4992
03:16:21.92 --> 03:16:24.24
that they had to get fact checked.

4993
03:16:24.24 --> 03:16:25.56
Oh yeah.

4994
03:16:25.56 --> 03:16:27.96
So that's an indicator that, you know,

4995
03:16:27.96 --> 03:16:30.000
maybe we're getting looked at.

4996
03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:31.68
Well, obviously we are getting looked at.

4997
03:16:31.68 --> 03:16:35.08
So to combat that, to make sure that we always have

4998
03:16:35.08 --> 03:16:36.12
the ability to get information,

4999
03:16:36.12 --> 03:16:38.68
we have Jocko Underground, Jocko Underground.com.

5000
03:16:38.68 --> 03:16:40.08

We appreciate it.

5005
03:16:46.24 --> 03:16:49.36
If you can't afford it, it's $8.18 a month.

5006
03:16:49.36 --> 03:16:50.20
What do they say?

5007
03:16:50.20 --> 03:16:51.04
Like, let's do a cup of coffee.

5008
03:16:51.04 --> 03:16:51.92
Was that what they say?

5009
03:16:51.92 --> 03:16:52.76
Yeah, sometimes.

5010
03:16:52.76 --> 03:16:53.60
One it is.

5011
03:16:53.60 --> 03:16:54.44
Like about things.

5012
03:16:54.44 --> 03:16:56.48
Well, if you have a cup of coffee every day

5013
03:16:56.48 --> 03:16:58.56
and you're buying it from one of the,

5014
03:16:58.56 --> 03:17:00.72
like more well-known coffee shops,

5015
03:17:00.72 --> 03:17:03.36
you're definitely spending more than $8.18.

5016
03:17:03.36 --> 03:17:06.20
Oh yeah, monthly, even if you're having the most,

5017
03:17:06.20 --> 03:17:07.92
unless you're not drinking coffee at all,

5018
03:17:07.92 --> 03:17:10.36
you're spending more than $8.18.

5019
03:17:10.36 --> 03:17:11.92
Even if you're going to the grocery store,

5020
03:17:11.92 --> 03:17:15.20
getting, yeah, you're gonna spend maybe eight bucks,

5021
03:17:15.20 --> 03:17:16.64
maybe coffee for the month.

5022
03:17:16.64 --> 03:17:17.68
Pretty cheap, you can get.

5023
03:17:17.68 --> 03:17:19.84
If you can't afford it, we still want you in the game.

5024

Eshalonfront Leadership Consultancy, go to eshalonfront.com.

5042
03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:03.80
If you need help in your organization, we can help you.

5043
03:18:03.80 --> 03:18:04.96
We can help you through leadership.

5044
03:18:04.96 --> 03:18:06.36
We solve problems through leadership.

5045
03:18:06.36 --> 03:18:09.08
Go to eshalonfront.com for details on that.

5046
03:18:09.08 --> 03:18:11.16
We also have an online training academy.

5047
03:18:11.16 --> 03:18:13.000
I mentioned that a couple times today,

5048
03:18:14.04 --> 03:18:15.52
where we teach leadership.

5049
03:18:15.52 --> 03:18:18.52
Now look, leadership, it doesn't mean that you're the CEO,

5050
03:18:18.52 --> 03:18:21.36
or you're the COO, or you're the commanding officer.

5051
03:18:21.36 --> 03:18:23.08
There's leadership no matter where you are

5052
03:18:23.08 --> 03:18:23.92
in an organization.

5053
03:18:23.92 --> 03:18:27.72
And if you're the frontline individual contributor,

5054
03:18:27.72 --> 03:18:32.24
or the frontline assaulter on a team,

5055
03:18:32.24 --> 03:18:34.72
you are still in a leadership position.

5056
03:18:34.72 --> 03:18:36.60
You're leading your teammates.

5057
03:18:36.60 --> 03:18:38.40
You're actually leading your boss.

5058
03:18:38.40 --> 03:18:39.60
You're leading your family.

5059
03:18:39.60 --> 03:18:41.72
You're leading your friends.

5060
03:18:41.72 --> 03:18:45.000
Become a better leader and you'll have a better life.

5061
03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:49.16
Go to extremowinership.com, join the academy.

5062
03:18:49.16 --> 03:18:54.16
And if you want to help service members active and retired,

5063
03:18:54.24 --> 03:18:56.44
you wanna help their families, Gold Star families,

5064
03:18:56.44 --> 03:18:57.92
check out Mark Lee's mom, Mama Lee.

5065
03:18:57.92 --> 03:18:59.68
She's got a charity organization.

5066
03:18:59.68 --> 03:19:01.72
If you wanna donate or you wanna get involved,

5067
03:19:01.72 --> 03:19:04.68
go to americasmightywaryears.org.

5068
03:19:04.68 --> 03:19:07.80
Don't forget about also Micah Fink's organization,

5069
03:19:09.20 --> 03:19:11.80
heroesandhorses.org.

5070
03:19:11.80 --> 03:19:14.36
Also, check out Marcus and Amber.

5071
03:19:14.36 --> 03:19:17.40
Capone, they've got vetsolutions.org.

5072
03:19:17.40 --> 03:19:19.48
Check out some of those charities.

5073
03:19:19.48 --> 03:19:20.76
And if you wanna connect once again,

5074
03:19:20.76 --> 03:19:23.12
if you wanna connect with a new treatment center,

5075
03:19:23.12 --> 03:19:25.56
A-N-E-W, treatment center.

5076
03:19:26.48 --> 03:19:29.32
Go to annuetreatmentcenter.com.

5077
03:19:29.32 --> 03:19:30.96
They're on social as well,

5078
03:19:30.96 --> 03:19:32.64
a new treatment center on Facebook, LinkedIn,

5079
03:19:32.64 --> 03:19:35.40
YouTube, Instagram, they're there.

5080
03:19:35.40 --> 03:19:37.96
And as for us, we're also in those places.

5081
03:19:39.48 --> 03:19:41.16
Echo, is that Echo Charles?

5082
03:19:41.16 --> 03:19:42.52
I am Matt Jockelwilig.

5083
03:19:42.52 --> 03:19:45.72
Of course, be wary, be wary of that algorithm.

5084
03:19:45.72 --> 03:19:49.20
And thanks once again to Megan and Karlyn

5085
03:19:49.20 --> 03:19:51.36
for joining us today to share their knowledge

5086
03:19:51.36 --> 03:19:53.68
with us to try and educate me.

5087
03:19:53.68 --> 03:19:57.44
And thanks to both them for dedicating their lives

5088
03:19:57.44 --> 03:19:59.12
to helping other people.

5089
03:20:00.88 --> 03:20:04.92
Also, thanks to all our service men and women out there

5090
03:20:04.92 --> 03:20:08.88
around the globe that are standing watch against evil.

5091
03:20:08.88 --> 03:20:11.80
And a big thanks to our police and law enforcement,

5092
03:20:11.80 --> 03:20:16.04
paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, firefighters, correctional

5093
03:20:16.04 --> 03:20:18.60
officers, border patrol, secret service,

5094
03:20:18.60 --> 03:20:20.12
all the first responders.

5095
03:20:20.12 --> 03:20:23.40
Thank you for protecting us from evil here at home.

5096
03:20:24.56 --> 03:20:26.000
And everyone else out there,

5097
03:20:27.60 --> 03:20:28.52
pay attention.

5098
03:20:30.28 --> 03:20:33.68
Pay attention to that mental check engine light.

5099
03:20:33.68 --> 03:20:35.24
Pay attention to your own.

5100
03:20:36.76 --> 03:20:39.28
Pay attention to the people around you.

5101
03:20:39.28 --> 03:20:42.40
And if that check engine light comes on,

5102
03:20:42.40 --> 03:20:43.84
don't just keep driving.

5103
03:20:45.52 --> 03:20:46.52
Pull over for a minute.

5104
03:20:48.20 --> 03:20:50.56
Call that mind mechanic, call that therapist

5105
03:20:50.56 --> 03:20:55.56
or that psychologist who can help get your mind back up

5106
03:20:56.48 --> 03:20:58.60
and running the way it's supposed to.

5107
03:20:58.60 --> 03:21:03.20
So that you can go out and get after it.

5108
03:21:03.20 --> 03:21:08.20
And until next time, the Zeko and Jocko, out.
