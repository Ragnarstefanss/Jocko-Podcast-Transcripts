[00:00:00] Everybody.
[00:00:02] And he will Heep
[00:00:05] who we hope
[00:00:06] can be
[00:00:08] from the world to death.
[00:00:10] He may be
[00:00:14] died
[00:00:17] Good. Good. This is Jockel Podcast number 160. With echo Charles and me, Jockel
[00:00:43] and me, I'm going to go. Good evening. Good evening. October. I'm going to head your way
[00:01:02] and see you today. Though sometimes I wonder why I should. Sometimes you don't seem
[00:01:17] to care and that makes me mad brother. And then when I see you, it doesn't really make
[00:01:29] me feel any better. Shoot it. Is that what this is for? It doesn't seem to be. It actually
[00:01:47] just makes me remember the way things used to be. Better times. It makes me
[00:01:59] wonder why things turned out this way. What did I do wrong? Should I have done something
[00:02:12] different? What could I have said? You never let me down ever. But now you won't even talk
[00:02:30] to me. I was looking at some of the things you wrote to me in the past. I opened up an
[00:02:41] email. In it, you wrote, I feel it again washing over me. The descent into degeneration
[00:02:54] and disintegration, the smell of filth, black water mixed with blood and gunpowder and shit.
[00:03:04] The American soldier covered in filth 11 months into a 16 month deployment. The insurgents
[00:03:17] grown men hiding behind children. Women wailing over the dead, explosions and screams
[00:03:26] and fragments of concrete flying through the air and frog men enter the scene to take the
[00:03:36] hand of the American soldier and pull him from the whirlpool to set his feet back on the
[00:03:43] rock and speak words of hope. We are the prophets of doom and destruction. We enter an
[00:03:52] area and take back the lost pride of America. We redden the stripes blue the field and
[00:04:02] make the stars of our tattered and humiliated battleants and shine once again. We hold it
[00:04:11] high. We carry a nation on our shoulders and we bring the enemy to its knees. We do not live
[00:04:22] in fear of death or wounding or even worse rejection by the country we love. I feel my mind
[00:04:33] becoming a part and the old sleeping animal coming out. I tried to keep it inside but it
[00:04:43] cannot help but attend the call to battle. When you originally wrote that to me I thought
[00:05:00] to myself. Yup. He's there again. Where he should be. I knew it wouldn't last forever. But
[00:05:19] where are you now? Now you see distant. In my head I can see you smile. I can hear you laugh
[00:05:32] but it's only in my head. I was surfing the other day. It was one of those days of good
[00:05:44] day. Solid swell. No wind. Tied was low and the sky was clear and bright. I kept looking
[00:05:57] out toward the outside where you used to sit and wait for the big set waves. I thought
[00:06:09] I saw you a couple times but it wasn't you. I heard someone paddling behind me must be
[00:06:22] you. I thought no. Nothing. No one's there. I'm all alone out here. Everything is the
[00:06:41] same but nothing is the same. Everything is changed but nothing is changed.
[00:06:52] Does anything ever change? Look at the waves as they approach the shore. Each wave formed
[00:07:06] through random combinations of wind and sea and pressure and each one completely unique.
[00:07:17] Then they break. They're gone forever. But then another one comes behind it and another
[00:07:29] one. They are all different but they're all the same. And I see some of the past and the
[00:07:42] future and I see some of the future in the past and I begin to wonder which is which.
[00:07:52] How did I get here? Where am I going to end up? Where are you? I look at some more
[00:08:08] you're writing. You are telling a story, writing a story about a man, about God, about life,
[00:08:23] about death. And this is what you wrote. I am ready to go. He thought to himself. But for you,
[00:08:37] I wait for the appointed time. They will. He said to himself and closed his eyes and placed
[00:08:47] his hands on the pages as if there was some strength there and he prayed. While he prayed,
[00:08:57] he also thought of past times. He breathed in deep and exiled. Deliver us from the evil one,
[00:09:10] he muttered. And he thought of all the reasons he had no right to say this prayer. At that,
[00:09:21] he stated himself, opened his eyes and looked out into the first light of the morning. He saw
[00:09:30] a face not his own looking back at him from the window and disappear. But he was not startled. This
[00:09:40] kind of thing was normal. I'm ready for you. He thought to himself. While he ran that morning,
[00:09:52] he did not think about anything. His mind retreated deep into itself, or perhaps it shut down
[00:09:59] altogether and he wore no expression. He only looked out at the sea and watched as the sea birds
[00:10:07] glided above the undulating plane of water, moving close above its surface, but managing somehow,
[00:10:14] not to touch it. At home, he heaved weights around on a small concrete slab.
[00:10:24] His routine effortlessly recited and at the same time painfully undertaken again
[00:10:30] without fought or care. Every morning the same, marking off time until an appointed end,
[00:10:44] his final rendezvous.
[00:10:52] That's what you wrote.
[00:10:53] Is that what we are doing here?
[00:11:01] Marking off time until an appointed end?
[00:11:08] My memory plays tricks on me.
[00:11:15] How many days do I remember?
[00:11:17] How many days do I actually remember?
[00:11:27] And what good is a day that I can't remember?
[00:11:33] Did it happen? Did it exist?
[00:11:37] I want to remember every day, but I can't.
[00:11:48] I let some of them go and I hate that.
[00:11:53] I want to remember and remember the times we had together.
[00:12:09] We played songs on the guitar, but I can't hear them anymore.
[00:12:16] They are gone. I can't recreate them.
[00:12:32] I'm not good enough.
[00:12:37] Can we play them again?
[00:12:40] One more song.
[00:12:51] Here is some more of your writing.
[00:12:56] I am God's messenger.
[00:13:00] I am a chieftain of Michael the angel.
[00:13:05] He has granted my request to help you
[00:13:08] for his you who are doing the bidding of the king.
[00:13:13] We have heard your many prayers.
[00:13:16] They burn before us day and night.
[00:13:19] Yes, heaven is full of the fragrance of your prayers.
[00:13:24] And I bring glad tidings from the Lord of Lords.
[00:13:31] He is preparing his mount to ride here.
[00:13:34] But there is still more to be done on earth before he wields his scythe and sword upon it.
[00:13:45] I bring a message.
[00:13:48] The Lord of Lords wants to help you reap the spirits against whom you are warring.
[00:13:55] Indeed, Satan has asked to have you.
[00:14:03] But we will not let that happen.
[00:14:09] Of course, you always have a choice.
[00:14:14] I have come a long way though.
[00:14:18] I came when we heard your last prayer.
[00:14:20] You will not be turned.
[00:14:34] When I read that, it seems obvious.
[00:14:42] Even God was on your side.
[00:14:44] God.
[00:14:48] But if God was on your side, how did you end up like this then?
[00:14:55] How could you do this to me?
[00:15:00] What about me?
[00:15:03] Yeah, I know.
[00:15:04] I'm being selfish, but what about me?
[00:15:15] What I'm not going to see you today, you can wait.
[00:15:20] After everything I did for you, after everything we went through together,
[00:15:25] you can wait.
[00:15:37] December.
[00:15:43] Okay.
[00:15:46] I calm down a little bit.
[00:15:47] I pride myself in keeping control of my emotions,
[00:15:58] but I got to admit, you had me break down a little bit for a while.
[00:16:05] Do you see that?
[00:16:09] You probably laugh at me.
[00:16:12] So I'm going to come up and see you today.
[00:16:14] Okay.
[00:16:17] Is that cool?
[00:16:20] I mean, it's supposed to be cool.
[00:16:25] If nothing else, just to say goodbye.
[00:16:33] I'll bring you a beer or two.
[00:16:37] I don't even drink anymore, but you know what?
[00:16:39] If you crack one open with me, I'll have one with you.
[00:16:46] Like old times.
[00:16:52] What happened to those times?
[00:16:58] We were brothers.
[00:16:59] And when we came home, we knew.
[00:17:08] We made it.
[00:17:12] We made it, man.
[00:17:16] As crazy it seems, I was actually never that worried about you.
[00:17:24] Maybe you were blessed.
[00:17:25] Maybe you were lucky.
[00:17:28] Maybe it was both, but whatever it was, it worked.
[00:17:36] You even wrote to me during your next deployment.
[00:17:41] This is what you wrote.
[00:17:45] All I interject is my part, the firing and yelling part.
[00:17:51] But the bullets do not hit me.
[00:17:53] They never hit me. They passed through me like a miracle.
[00:17:59] Two days ago, we drove through a village and knocked all the power lines down.
[00:18:04] And it was night and the sparks were like incoming RPGs.
[00:18:11] I wished they were and brazed.
[00:18:17] But they were.
[00:18:19] And the IEDs won't come either.
[00:18:21] They won't hit me.
[00:18:24] It's like I'm being protected.
[00:18:34] You capitalize the P in protected.
[00:18:41] You believed it was a higher power.
[00:18:43] I can't write the argue with you on that.
[00:18:55] But if that's so true, how did this happen?
[00:19:02] Why did this happen?
[00:19:04] Where did that protection go?
[00:19:09] Did it abandon you?
[00:19:11] Like you abandoned me?
[00:19:17] What am I supposed to do now?
[00:19:26] You know what?
[00:19:29] I'm not going to see you today.
[00:19:30] Okay, you can wait.
[00:19:43] February.
[00:19:47] It's a new year.
[00:19:50] Let's try this again.
[00:19:56] Time heals all wounds.
[00:19:58] They say, so we should be good now, right?
[00:20:04] I should be over it all by now.
[00:20:07] I'll come see you and at a minimum, say goodbye.
[00:20:11] Just say goodbye.
[00:20:14] Just tell you that's it.
[00:20:17] No hard feelings.
[00:20:18] Don't take it personally.
[00:20:19] I've decided I'm going to go ahead and proceed on down the path without you.
[00:20:30] Alone.
[00:20:34] And I'm used to being alone.
[00:20:38] No big deal.
[00:20:40] I kind of like it.
[00:20:41] But even I have to admit it was nice.
[00:20:51] Nice to have someone to talk to.
[00:20:52] Nice to have someone to talk to without even talking.
[00:20:55] I think a look, a nod, a smile.
[00:21:09] No one is smiling back anymore.
[00:21:16] No one.
[00:21:16] Sometimes I look up at the night sky.
[00:21:29] That can approximate a smile.
[00:21:35] I see a smile in the sunset.
[00:21:38] I don't know why.
[00:21:41] I try to milk what I can out of every day.
[00:21:45] I should be cursing the sunset.
[00:21:52] That sunset means another day is gone.
[00:21:59] I should be cursing it, but I don't.
[00:22:04] I take a few minutes when I can and I watch it.
[00:22:07] Good night, Al-Hui.
[00:22:15] Good night, Chesty.
[00:22:19] Good night, Stoner.
[00:22:27] Maybe there's some relief that the day has gone.
[00:22:30] Is that it?
[00:22:31] That part of the race is over and there is an
[00:22:34] a damn thing I can do about it.
[00:22:44] When my oldest daughter was little,
[00:22:48] we would watch the sunset over the ocean
[00:22:52] when we'd get the chance.
[00:22:56] When she was at that age,
[00:22:58] when she was only just starting to talk,
[00:22:59] she could just say a handful of words.
[00:23:06] When she wanted a drink of milk,
[00:23:09] she would say nook.
[00:23:14] When she wanted to go on the swing,
[00:23:16] she would say,
[00:23:17] Ving!
[00:23:21] When I would throw up her up in the air and catch her,
[00:23:24] she would laugh and she would giggle and she would say the word,
[00:23:28] again.
[00:23:34] And she and I were sitting on the sea wall.
[00:23:38] It was autumn and the sun was leaning towards the south
[00:23:42] and we watched and she watched the colors in the sky,
[00:23:48] red and yellow and orange, like fire and the water ignited,
[00:23:59] then it turned black and the sun disappeared into the ocean
[00:24:04] and she looked up at me and she said, again!
[00:24:08] She wanted it back,
[00:24:22] but I couldn't do anything for her.
[00:24:29] I was powerless.
[00:24:30] I still am.
[00:24:38] I can't stop the clock and I can't bring back a day,
[00:24:42] not one single day, not one single minute,
[00:24:46] you get what you get.
[00:24:54] And that sunset will keep a man's ego in check,
[00:24:57] especially when you're complete lack of control
[00:25:01] disappoints the little angel sitting on your knee.
[00:25:12] And I can't control this situation either.
[00:25:17] And that's things.
[00:25:21] And I don't want to face that.
[00:25:22] I don't want to say goodbye.
[00:25:30] That can wait.
[00:25:35] You can wait.
[00:25:43] May.
[00:25:46] Springtime.
[00:25:47] Springtime.
[00:25:51] Rebirth.
[00:25:52] So I'm told.
[00:25:57] The winter swell fades, but the water warms up.
[00:26:02] The days get longer again.
[00:26:08] I like that.
[00:26:11] I look at more of your words.
[00:26:13] They read, he found a sleeping spot.
[00:26:20] Happy and excited with anticipation.
[00:26:23] He thought of the glory which was to come and he slept
[00:26:26] tranquil and did not dream.
[00:26:30] The blue midnight sky held no trace of trouble,
[00:26:34] almost no clouds.
[00:26:36] Only a whisp of silver gray near the moon
[00:26:40] that seemed to be something beautiful for the humans
[00:26:43] below to look at as an omen that something good might happen.
[00:26:49] As some kind of sign that heaven awaited it,
[00:26:55] the good thing.
[00:27:02] The good thing, you wrote.
[00:27:04] You wrote.
[00:27:07] What am I supposed to do with that?
[00:27:13] You set me up, you know,
[00:27:16] with thoughts of the good thing.
[00:27:21] Because there we were.
[00:27:25] You know, we were headed in the right direction
[00:27:28] toward the good things.
[00:27:34] When you listen to me, things worked out always.
[00:27:39] Right?
[00:27:42] You know it.
[00:27:45] When you listen to me and you put your damn heart in check,
[00:27:50] things worked out.
[00:27:51] You know, what's your problem?
[00:27:56] You listen to your heart too much.
[00:27:57] You know this.
[00:28:01] Let your emotions get a hold of you.
[00:28:03] You know it's true.
[00:28:06] I told you a thousand times,
[00:28:08] ten thousand times,
[00:28:12] and you tried to listen and you did listen sometimes.
[00:28:15] Sometimes.
[00:28:20] But your heart couldn't be completely subdued.
[00:28:24] It was too strong.
[00:28:28] Too strong for its own good.
[00:28:35] And yeah, I know.
[00:28:40] I know that's what makes you, you.
[00:28:43] You find.
[00:28:51] But you should listen to me.
[00:28:54] You should have listened.
[00:28:57] And now I am here and you are there and there's nothing I can do about it.
[00:29:13] Comparison.
[00:29:14] Jullai.
[00:29:28] Full fledged summer now.
[00:29:33] Campfires and guitar on the regular.
[00:29:38] Where are you at?
[00:29:39] I'm at.
[00:29:43] And let me ask you something.
[00:29:44] If you aren't going to come around, then can you just let me be?
[00:29:51] I don't want you in my head right now.
[00:29:56] I don't want to get dragged back every time I strum a chord.
[00:29:59] I remember.
[00:30:12] We were traveling up the coast.
[00:30:14] You made lazy days.
[00:30:21] Surfing by day.
[00:30:22] Playing on the get boxes at night.
[00:30:29] We were looking for bigger waves.
[00:30:31] The kind of waves that get the blood flowing.
[00:30:37] We found so.
[00:30:44] But what were we really looking for?
[00:30:45] We were looking for that thing.
[00:30:58] That moment.
[00:31:00] That moment when nothing else matters.
[00:31:05] That moment that is sourced directly from the battlefield.
[00:31:12] Hard to find anywhere else.
[00:31:13] So we try and get close to it.
[00:31:18] Jujitsu surfing, whatever, but it's hard to replace.
[00:31:22] Maybe it can't be replaced.
[00:31:28] Maybe it just is what it is.
[00:31:34] I think I understood that.
[00:31:39] I'm not sure you did.
[00:31:40] I was able to rationalize it, figure out, detach from it.
[00:31:48] See it from the outside.
[00:31:53] Before that trip up the coast,
[00:31:56] you had written me these words.
[00:32:00] Send us.
[00:32:01] We are thirsty for screams and gore and hell and dirt and shit.
[00:32:11] We will hack our way through scores of bodies, form them up in a pile and burn them so we can
[00:32:17] kill by the pyre light.
[00:32:21] Somebody spread the good news that the killers teeth are sharp and their guns are clean and their
[00:32:27] souls are dead so no one needs anything but victory and sacred death.
[00:32:33] When is it done?
[00:32:41] You see that was your heart talking again.
[00:32:47] The same heart that wrapped around a girl you met.
[00:32:50] The same heart that brought my kids birthday presents.
[00:32:54] The same heart that was broken by the loss of our friends.
[00:33:02] A heart capable of both devotion and destruction.
[00:33:13] I told you to let it all go.
[00:33:15] I told you.
[00:33:27] But I can't control everything.
[00:33:28] I'm still powerless.
[00:33:45] September.
[00:33:50] A year has passed.
[00:33:52] Or was it yesterday?
[00:34:00] Time seems like a trick but the trick is on me because it's no trick at all.
[00:34:05] Time does not waver.
[00:34:07] It does not relinquish.
[00:34:08] It isn't tricky.
[00:34:10] It just is.
[00:34:11] It is moving on without judgment and without mercy and it will keep moving.
[00:34:23] I am coming up to see you today.
[00:34:28] I have to.
[00:34:32] I have to say goodbye.
[00:34:33] I can't do it like this anymore.
[00:34:38] Carrying you around in my head.
[00:34:43] Bringing back the past so often that it's interfering with the present and the future.
[00:34:49] That's not right.
[00:34:53] That wasn't part of the deal.
[00:34:54] I arrived.
[00:35:09] You're still there.
[00:35:12] What I left you.
[00:35:13] I brought you a beer and some wax for your board and a guitar pick.
[00:35:24] Even though you play better without one.
[00:35:30] I already went and saw Mikey and Mark.
[00:35:36] I save you for last.
[00:35:38] That's the way it is.
[00:35:44] You were the last to go.
[00:35:55] And this is the way it always ends.
[00:36:01] Here.
[00:36:01] It always ends like this.
[00:36:09] And I will end up here too.
[00:36:16] But I didn't know you'd end up here so soon.
[00:36:18] Here's your beer.
[00:36:33] I'll pour it in the grass for you.
[00:36:35] I'll put this bar of surf wax on top of your grapestone.
[00:36:49] Look at Tarpick next to it.
[00:36:50] I read the words.
[00:37:04] It's etched in that white granite rock.
[00:37:19] Seth A Stone.
[00:37:25] Commander.
[00:37:26] The US Navy.
[00:37:31] Afghanistan Iraq.
[00:37:36] September 17, 1976.
[00:37:41] September 30, 2017.
[00:37:44] Silver star with oak leaf cluster.
[00:37:56] Bronze star metal with valor.
[00:38:04] Faithful warrior.
[00:38:05] Faithful warrior.
[00:38:15] I always tell everyone to carry on.
[00:38:38] Tomorrow but not to dwell.
[00:38:40] But now I'm dwelling myself.
[00:38:51] And I know I shouldn't.
[00:38:56] I thought long and hard about it.
[00:39:10] And I was going to say goodbye.
[00:39:26] But I'm not going to say it.
[00:39:34] There's no need.
[00:39:36] You're still with me.
[00:39:45] You're in the ocean and in the sky and in the earth beneath my feet.
[00:39:59] You're still with me.
[00:39:59] And I'm good with that.
[00:40:05] Here's one more thing you wrote.
[00:40:31] I thought the enemy is good as I could.
[00:40:38] I lost myself but in doing so I found myself.
[00:40:45] It is a path.
[00:40:49] You have to work your own one out.
[00:40:53] It is a struggle.
[00:40:54] I've listened to the truth.
[00:41:04] I am humbled and mystified by this life we live.
[00:41:09] I am humbled and mystified by this life too.
[00:41:30] I am going to keep on living it.
[00:41:35] I can't stop the sunsets and I can't bring them back but I can make them count.
[00:42:03] And that is what I am going to do.
[00:42:09] I am going to keep on living and I am going to make it count.
[00:42:39] I am going to keep on living and I am going to make it count.
[00:43:09] So, here we are.
[00:43:32] And speaking of living life and trying to make it count, we are doing this gig here tonight.
[00:43:54] So, we are live.
[00:44:24] We generally call this a rough transition.
[00:44:34] Yeah.
[00:44:37] So, everyone that is here our first live podcast.
[00:44:46] Thanks for everyone for thanks to everyone for coming down.
[00:44:49] As I thought about what to talk about tonight, I went down into a pretty heavy subject.
[00:45:11] And that is part of what this whole thing is.
[00:45:23] All the people that have reached out to me over the last few years that were able to overcome
[00:45:30] some tough situation because of the podcast and to the same with me.
[00:45:42] The same lessons that we have learned from the podcast, from books, from having people on.
[00:45:50] It is the same.
[00:45:52] We get the benefit of that too.
[00:45:55] And here we are.
[00:46:04] Here we are.
[00:46:06] So, thanks for coming.
[00:46:13] Echo Charles thanks for pressing record.
[00:46:16] And stop by the way, it is a whole thing.
[00:46:29] And one of the main things, and one of the main reasons I wanted to do a live podcast is to
[00:46:36] actually see everyone and give a chance for you to see us and for you to see what we do and what it looks like.
[00:46:44] And this is pretty much what it looks like.
[00:46:46] We are sitting in a small room and we press record and this is what we do.
[00:46:52] And it is great to have everyone here and to see your faces.
[00:46:57] And I have talked about this before.
[00:46:58] I mean, when I am recording, I am talking to you.
[00:47:02] I am talking to the people that I have heard from over the past few years.
[00:47:06] I know you are listening.
[00:47:08] And even from day one, I wanted to put on their headsets.
[00:47:13] And I wanted to think like, okay, yep, this is where going in.
[00:47:16] This is it.
[00:47:17] Like it is on.
[00:47:18] And I want you to waste your time.
[00:47:20] I don't want to waste your time.
[00:47:24] So, that is why we are doing this tonight.
[00:47:29] I thank you all for coming.
[00:47:31] I also want to take advantage of the fact that you are here to do some live Q&A, which is very fun for me to do.
[00:47:38] I enjoyed doing it. And we did solicit questions from the ticket sales.
[00:47:46] Did I just escalate that?
[00:47:49] Yeah, we did that for ticket sales.
[00:47:54] And so we got some of those questions here.
[00:47:57] And we will start off with a couple of those.
[00:47:58] And then we have got, you can bring the Q&A lights on.
[00:48:03] And then we are going to, we have got some folks out there, volunteers with microphones.
[00:48:07] And then once we will open it up and we are going to react and answer some questions.
[00:48:15] And I know some of you were waiting to get a picture of what you get some stuff signed before
[00:48:21] this started and we will finish this and we will wrap up that for everybody here.
[00:48:26] So, it is awesome that you all are sitting here.
[00:48:28] I appreciate you coming down.
[00:48:30] And let's do a little Q&A.
[00:48:33] Yeah, yeah, all right.
[00:48:34] Yeah, it is interesting because usually we just sort of see the cameras.
[00:48:40] You know they are on the other side of the cameras.
[00:48:44] But you just see it and now it is like, oh, you actually see the view.
[00:48:48] It is different.
[00:48:49] It is different.
[00:48:50] So, all right, first question.
[00:48:53] Observation.
[00:48:55] Well, you see them saying like, now I look in the camera like, oh, okay.
[00:48:58] You see them saying?
[00:48:59] I'm just saying you see the people.
[00:49:02] Awesome.
[00:49:03] Well, let's not blow it anymore.
[00:49:05] Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[00:49:08] Leaving in the first question, we can't edit out your stuff right?
[00:49:12] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:13] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:16] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:17] All right, Jocco, what impresses you the most when you're considering to work with someone or
[00:49:23] hire them to be part of your team?
[00:49:25] This is a question I get asked all the time, everybody wants them to know who to hire and what
[00:49:29] I look for and obviously I look for someone that's humble and I look for someone that's balanced
[00:49:36] and really, you know, it's one of those things where as much as you can before you hire someone
[00:49:43] get to know them and the advice we give people the national on front all the time when they're
[00:49:47] looking to hire someone is we say, look, if you can hire them temporarily, bring them on as
[00:49:52] a contractor for 90 days, you have to see them in the environment that they're actually going into,
[00:49:56] they're going to be working in before you know what they're really going to be like because just like
[00:50:02] going through, they screen people like crazy to go into seal training and they can't tell who's
[00:50:07] going to make it and who's not going to make it. They just can't tell and they you you work with
[00:50:13] people in the seal teams and you think you know what they're going to be like when you're going to
[00:50:17] combat but you just can't tell. You can have a decent idea but you just can't tell and so if you
[00:50:22] get the opportunity or the best way to do it is try and bring people on board in a temporary manner so
[00:50:27] you get to know them better and then once you know them you can either hire them or you can get
[00:50:31] rid of them easily. Next question makes sense.
[00:50:38] Hi, Jaco for a new entrepreneur or someone new to a leadership position who is meeting with their
[00:50:44] employees or direct report or direct reports for the first time. What are some key things to address
[00:50:51] during that initial conversation? As soon as you meet someone that's going to be working for you,
[00:50:59] you're immediately making impressions so we want to make a good impression. We also don't want to go
[00:51:05] okay it's a it's a dichotomy because you're immediately building a relationship with them but you can't
[00:51:12] go overboard and be all buddy buddy. But that's why I followed the hack worth model and I actually
[00:51:17] took that to the next level. Hack worth wouldn't like laugh and joke around with the troops for six weeks.
[00:51:24] I up that to eight weeks because I'm a little bit more hard course. Yeah. So you but but one thing
[00:51:31] that's good out of the gate is put out some brief general guidelines like some some of the most
[00:51:36] broad guidance that you can possibly give which is hey look here's what's important to me. We're
[00:51:42] going to do a great job. We're going to work hard and this is our mission and this is what we're
[00:51:46] going to focus on and that's it. You don't need to come out of the gate trying to show everyone that
[00:51:51] you're the man. You don't need to do that guess what you're the boss you actually de facto are the
[00:51:57] man so don't run around and try and prove yourself out of the gate. Get to know them let that
[00:52:04] relationship build over time and that's we're going to end up in the best situation. Make sense.
[00:52:10] You sort of did that to me even as friends like this like here here good to meet you here's you
[00:52:19] good to meet you eight weeks just like that next question yeah well it's funny too because now when I meet
[00:52:31] people like tonight I'm all nice to everyone now yeah yeah you changed you but if I was going to be
[00:52:38] like getting in the game with them and somehow yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:52:42] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that eight week probationary jacco period who are some of the well-known
[00:52:49] leaders today who you believe best exemplify extreme ownership be it in politics military or business
[00:52:55] military you know obviously I like like like matters a lot not effect I like matters yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:53:08] I I generally same thing yep and McMaster same thing all those guys are awesome uh
[00:53:14] chronic pharlin or general McFarlin who who just retired who I worked with four in the body who is awesome
[00:53:19] so though there's a lot of really good military examples the business examples there's a mulalee who
[00:53:25] turned around forward there's a great book called American icon and it's a great leadership book
[00:53:31] I actually was going to cover it but I never did because it's hard to cover books about business
[00:53:38] compared to books about combat but it's a really good book American icon great ownership great attitude
[00:53:43] and politics this was a super hard one but then I just thought oh damn crunch off
[00:53:51] what up and really just the way dance and he's taking position like he's doing a great job
[00:54:01] it's very very cool to see so yeah there you go what else go to four cool
[00:54:10] hi jocco and echo I recently read the book Marine the life of Chesty Pillar and in the book
[00:54:17] Chesty references and the unnecessary loads of administrative paperwork that was required to be prepared
[00:54:23] for the military I also recently remember on a recent podcast you recalling a situation in
[00:54:29] Ramadi where you're platoon leaders we're not thrilled to fill out required paperwork I'm a squad
[00:54:35] sergeant in a prominent American police department and I'm experiencing the same dilemma
[00:54:42] the micromanaging and oversight is extreme and it's taking a toll on the morale of the officers
[00:54:48] citywide the tedious paperwork and constant micromanaging is preventing good cops from being proactive
[00:54:56] I feel like the job quote unquote has changed beyond recognition I had to appreciate your advice
[00:55:02] on how to approach the bullshit paperwork and increase the morale of my cops thank you for your time
[00:55:12] okay so what would I do in this situation first of all I am going to be awesome at the paperwork
[00:55:21] I'm gonna do it so well that because if you blow off the paperwork then you go to your boss and say
[00:55:28] the paperwork sucks and it's not any good the guy looks at you and says oh you know what you don't
[00:55:32] even not to do the paperwork how do you know how do you know if it's harder or not so what I'm going to
[00:55:36] do is I'm going to do I'm going to start building a case that's what I'm going to do so I'm going to do
[00:55:40] the paperwork I'm actually going to log down how many hours I put into the paperwork I'm going to
[00:55:45] follow that paperwork and see where it goes and see if anyone actually reads it right because if I
[00:55:50] can go to my boss and say hey I spent 28 hours a week filing this paperwork and no not one single
[00:55:57] person read it and then you take the manpower of everyone in the department and then what you do is
[00:56:02] you actually build a case when you go into talk to the boss you should have a full magazine of
[00:56:08] ammunition to combat this paperwork that you're being forced to do you have to be able to explain it
[00:56:14] to them in a rational logical manner and you can't you can't make any headway against your boss
[00:56:23] if you are trying to fight from the low ground the low ground is oh why don't really turn into
[00:56:29] paperwork and I don't really do the paperwork and I think the paperwork is crap then they're looking
[00:56:34] down and you what are you talking about how are you dare you say that you don't even do it you don't
[00:56:38] even know what you're doing you got to get on the high ground how do you get on the high ground
[00:56:43] you get all that stuff done to the best of your ability you log down the hours it takes you get
[00:56:48] your whole little team doing it and you tell your whole team hey look I know this is painful right now
[00:56:52] everyone in this squad everyone in this platoon is gonna do all this we're gonna log down what it takes
[00:56:58] because I am gonna bring a solid case up the chain of command of where we need to limit this paperwork
[00:57:05] this is a long war situation you know I'm gonna took to build up all that paperwork it took years
[00:57:11] it took 20 years 30 years for that to happen are you suggest you'll come out the number the Navy
[00:57:17] in the seal teams the range are range procedures are super loose we go out there and we shoot like crazy
[00:57:23] and do all kinds of really dynamic things and we sometimes go to a Marine Corps range it was like
[00:57:28] everything was super tight and I would tell my guys that say look that's because that happened over
[00:57:35] years one mistake happens how do you stop that mistake from happening again put a rule in place
[00:57:39] that stops it another mistake's happened another mistake happens put another rule in place another
[00:57:44] mistake happens put a piece of paper to stop it from happening again and eventually you end up with
[00:57:48] the range it's barely even usable so that's what happened in this department there was little
[00:57:54] things that happened over time and they built and they build upon themselves and the next thing
[00:57:58] you know you can't even recognize what your actual job was so we have to so that took 20 years to
[00:58:04] happen you're not gonna undo it overnight and you're definitely not gonna undo it from the
[00:58:11] low ground you have to get the high ground you have to be a performer if you're not a performer
[00:58:18] you have no say do your job do it well fight the long war
[00:58:32] I'm all of a sudden thinking like maybe we need one of those little applause tracks
[00:58:36] you know when I answer a question yeah yeah when it's good man it's good
[00:58:45] next question what book has had the biggest impact on you and is a must read
[00:58:53] yeah about face at work thanks for coming welcome to the club
[00:59:05] all right good on
[00:59:10] okay next first good morning was that like an erotic role band just let's the crowd sing the chorus
[00:59:17] and a little bit if you did not join the military what do you think you'd be doing right now
[00:59:27] I think I would have ended up either in the police department or a firefighter that's what I think
[00:59:34] I would have done if I couldn't have gotten into the military that's probably what I would have
[00:59:38] done up doing why just because I had the urge to serve and do something physical and do something
[00:59:49] where I'm helping protect people I think that's why so I know there's a lot of cops and firefighters
[00:59:56] here so thanks for what you do
[01:00:13] what is the relationship between humility and vulnerability
[01:00:17] the relationship between humility and vulnerability okay interesting and there's an interesting
[01:00:29] dynamic that you get going on when you when you're humble okay so let's think about what happens
[01:00:38] when you're humble when you're humble you expose your vulnerabilities but what's cool is when you
[01:00:44] expose your vulnerabilities they become less vulnerable
[01:00:52] so that's why being humble is a win because if I'm taking over a position and I don't know how
[01:00:58] to do one of the jobs if I hide it it's it's haunting me and it's a weakness because as soon as
[01:01:06] it gets exposed I'm gonna look like you know weak and a loser but if I have a vulnerability
[01:01:12] and I'm humble enough to expose my vulnerability and say hey you know what guys I haven't actually
[01:01:18] done this before my old unit we didn't ever did this and I don't have to do it can I get some help
[01:01:22] here they're I'm being humble I'm exposing my vulnerability and all of a sudden it's not a
[01:01:27] vulnerability anymore because the because my team actually knows it and guess what then I get to
[01:01:34] practice and learn about the thing that was making me vulnerable yeah so
[01:01:40] making yourself vulnerable is fine and if you want to kill your vulnerabilities you have to
[01:01:48] be humble enough to expose them voluntarily voluntarily exposing your vulnerabilities
[01:01:56] is infinitely better than hiding them and letting them be uncovered by them you know
[01:02:04] it's not that's what it is it's it's it's animals like everyone else you're
[01:02:11] polluting if you have a vulnerability and you hide it and then they get it like they're
[01:02:16] coming at you with daggers with knives they're gonna get it so if you say hey this is the situation
[01:02:25] expose those vulnerability be humble enough to do that you'll be in a much better position
[01:02:30] yeah it seems like the leader like if you're the boss and you're trying to make like oh yeah
[01:02:36] I know everything and then like how you said they they find it you look way more stupid
[01:02:42] like in the beginning it feels like he looks more stupid in the beginning I would think anyway
[01:02:47] like oh I'm the boss supposed to know all this stuff yeah I think the key point of that is way more stupid
[01:02:53] yeah you know what I look like that I don't think so in here you know I'm gonna go back to this
[01:03:01] other one three dinner guests living or dead and why three dinner guests living or dead
[01:03:12] uh Mark Lee Mike Mansour Brian Joe how do you get the nickname jacco
[01:03:33] I answered this on Facebook live not fully though I didn't know fully
[01:03:38] uh anyways before I was born my dad wanted me to be a jacco my dad's name is John my dad's
[01:03:44] nickname is John no my dad wanted me to be a jacco my mom calls my dad
[01:03:50] John no my dad said I hope he's a jacco my mom said a jacco
[01:03:56] she's a good dude I don't the yeah I don't think he said that whole thing
[01:04:01] you know that's the deal and then I'm actually when I said that my mom said actually my dad was
[01:04:09] nicknamed John oh not by her but by his family because he was named after his uncle
[01:04:17] whose name was John Obo Ford for something like that yeah so there you go yeah man it goes deep there you go
[01:04:24] no that question for jacco do you teach your wife about being strategic and how open
[01:04:34] is she to how open is she to having her husband be her teacher that's a good one that's a
[01:04:44] that's a good one for who for for for ruining my life it's a good one for me
[01:05:06] first of all let's assess this how many people just people and I'm talking spouses
[01:05:13] how many people are just super open to being taught like if I was like let me teach you a little
[01:05:20] something you're in mean like that's that already starts off in a bad footing because it
[01:05:25] implies that I know something you don't know I can help you you're inferior to me you lack
[01:05:32] the spring knowledge that I have clearly I must instruct you that's key to quiz right
[01:05:44] it is offensive to my wife so do I sit around and you know trying teach my wife you know
[01:05:56] here's the deal here's the deal when we're dealing with our kids I absolutely do this now when
[01:06:03] I think about it you know I'll say to my wife hey listen oh the boys doing this and you're
[01:06:10] trying to do this don't do that all you're doing is you know it's oh he wants to get all crazy cool
[01:06:17] let's do this you're trying to combat I used to tell this when when the kids were really small
[01:06:22] because she's super nice and concerned and wants to make things right and wants to win arguments
[01:06:33] which when you're trying to win a logical argument with a four-year-old it doesn't work
[01:06:38] doesn't work and I say look you're arguing logic with a four-year-old so I think there's an appropriate
[01:06:43] time to do it you have to be careful that you're not trying to you know be the superior human
[01:06:49] yeah oh Mr. strategy want to teach me something about kids yeah so take it easy and all that being said
[01:06:58] I do have strategic conversations with my wife about the family team right like we're a business
[01:07:07] like your your house and your family is a business you have income you have expenditures you have
[01:07:14] long-term strategic goals so those kind of things we talk about and you know I'm the one that's sort
[01:07:19] of is usually saying hey what about this strategic goal what are you doing over here what do you
[01:07:23] want to do that so we have those conversations but not so much me saying how but me you know us
[01:07:31] figuring out what we're going together life this she ever like teach you how to be strategic in
[01:07:40] any way like be more sensitive or anything like that bro you serious no actually my the cool thing about
[01:07:53] my wife is she knows me really well and accepts those uphold deal she accepts the shortfall
[01:08:04] she knows that she got what she got she rolled a dice hey sorry yeah all right there you go
[01:08:14] next question can you share how someone that is introverted and has social anxiety can become a leader
[01:08:22] I mean first of all if you've got social anxiety you need to go through that exposure therapy
[01:08:28] which is what I wrote about in way the warrior kid that I didn't know I was writing about I didn't
[01:08:34] know as an actual psychological methodology until Jordan Peterson was explaining to me that well
[01:08:40] what you do is someone in the situations you give him small exposure it's like oh that's what
[01:08:43] happens in way the warrior kid you're smarter than I thought so you can do the same thing with this
[01:08:49] social anxiety you know you start talking from small groups you grow you get out hang out with
[01:08:52] people and you continue to do that until you get more comfortable so you can you can sort of over
[01:08:57] come that and it's the same thing with being introverted now there there are leaders that are
[01:09:07] more introverted but what you have to do is you have to bring people onto your team to complement
[01:09:16] that area where you're a little bit weak so if if you're a leader guess what you have to do you have
[01:09:24] to communicate to other human beings and sometimes you have to communicate to other human beings
[01:09:28] in large groups that's what happens that's what a leader does sure sometimes it can be on the
[01:09:33] phone sometimes it can be on email sometimes it can be in radio over the radio but there's times
[01:09:38] where you're going to have to communicate to the people that you're leading so if you're super introverted
[01:09:44] and uncomfortable with that and it's a challenge you're going to have to overcome that challenge yes
[01:09:50] you can get better at it through practice but some people are not going to ever get a really
[01:09:58] comfortable get some people are never going to get really comfortable talking in front of a group
[01:10:03] and so what what you do in that situation is you bring someone in your team that is really good at it
[01:10:10] and then when it's time to address the troops you you know you as the leader stand up and say
[01:10:16] here's the two things I'm worried about on this operation here's where we're heading and now
[01:10:22] Bill's going to brief you on the details of the plan and that's fine because Bill's allowed
[01:10:28] now if Bill's going to get up there and communicate really clearly and that's going to be great
[01:10:31] and you still gave enough as the figure head and as the leader of the organization that people
[01:10:37] go okay yep we heard from Jocco you know he put out the word he didn't say much
[01:10:41] doesn't even seem like he has to we we hear we's coming from so you just have to build a team
[01:10:46] that's going to compliment your weaknesses and you know generally if you're introverted well that
[01:10:51] means you're good at some other thing that that loudmouth isn't good at right the loudmouth is like
[01:10:56] who's going the front door kick it down and he doesn't have any sort of
[01:11:03] tactical sense of how to run an operation smoothly so you come up with a good plan and then you
[01:11:09] brief it's a bill loudmouth bill and then you say bill we're going to brief the troops and then
[01:11:14] you make it happen so you have to do a little bit of both you have to improve your personal skills
[01:11:19] which you can do through exposure and practice don't get up and talk about things that you don't
[01:11:25] know get up and talk about things that you do know that you're uncomfortable with and you practice
[01:11:31] and while you're practicing while you're getting better at that you also build a team where
[01:11:35] you compliment your own weaknesses and we all have leadership weaknesses and you got to build teams that
[01:11:40] can compliment that.
[01:11:46] A greedy.
[01:11:49] I'm glad. Next question. How can one guide or lead a leader above you especially when you're
[01:11:57] many links away on the chain of command or many links what down the chain of command?
[01:12:02] Oh so you want to guide a leader that's far away from you in the chain of command?
[01:12:13] Yeah. Yeah. You got a build relationship with that person. That's what you got to do.
[01:12:21] In fact, leadership is about building trust and building relationships with people and trust
[01:12:27] is leadership and leadership is trust and relationships are trust and relationships are leadership.
[01:12:32] These are like the trifecta of becoming a good leader. You build trust with people. You build relationships.
[01:12:39] And in a situation like this, if I have no if you and I don't know each other very well
[01:12:45] and I come up to you and say hey I think you should do this. I mean what's your reaction?
[01:12:49] But if you just approach someone that you don't have a relationship with and then you start
[01:12:52] telling them how to run things that's offensive, that's offensive to like most human beings.
[01:12:58] I have to get to know you. I have to see what kind of approach is going to work for you.
[01:13:04] Because you might be the kind of person if I know you a little bit we like you know I'm really
[01:13:07] working on my leadership. What do you think I could do better? That's great. Then we open the door
[01:13:10] or we can move forward. You might be the kind of person that I have to flank. You might be the kind of
[01:13:15] person that you won't listen to me but I say oh you should channel this book that I read or
[01:13:21] whatever. There's ways to do it. But to look at a target and know how you're going to attack the
[01:13:29] target without knowing anything about it, without having any intelligence on it, that's not going
[01:13:33] to be effective. So we have to actually gather some intelligence about the target. We have to and
[01:13:39] the way we do that is by building a relationship with. By getting to know that person. Once you know
[01:13:44] the person, then you can start to infuse and shift and mold and sculpt and influence the way that
[01:13:53] they lead. You have to build that relationship to kick things off. Next question. I'm not in the
[01:14:03] military nor am I a firefighter or law enforcement. I'm an air traffic controller here in the
[01:14:09] New York area. And I found myself in several leadership positions without within our union.
[01:14:17] Since I read extreme ownership, I've tried to implement this and the ideals that come with it. Overall,
[01:14:22] I believe it's been a success and of course still a work in progress. Specifically, the communication
[01:14:28] aspect of ensuring our people know why are we doing, why are we are doing something and how it
[01:14:34] affects them as it has been the biggest influence and game changer in my opinion. Union typically
[01:14:41] come hand in hand with what about me attitudes and we definitely have that within our ranks. This
[01:14:49] is something I've been trying to tackle with both new air controllers, new controllers and
[01:14:54] older ones and I think I'm making headways slowly but surely. Thanks to you and life. My question
[01:15:00] is this, have you ever had direct experience dealing with unions and this particular mindset?
[01:15:06] Is there any advice you can have specific to labor unions that could make this more efficient?
[01:15:13] Yeah, well we work with businesses all the time and we certainly work with businesses that are involved
[01:15:19] with or that either are unionized or partially unionized and yeah this is something that
[01:15:24] can be very, very common and the reason it can become very, very common is because the union
[01:15:33] is an organization and the company, the corporate, the headquarters is a separate organization.
[01:15:44] And so what happens is as we let these two elements grow, they tend to grow apart and they tend
[01:15:53] to start looking out for themselves and that becomes problematic. It becomes problematic and any
[01:16:00] organization where you've got the union on one side and what the union starts looking out for is
[01:16:04] what's good for them and what corporate is looking out for, what headquarters looking out for is
[01:16:09] what's good for them and what happens is we stop talking to each other and what we fail to realize
[01:16:15] is that both those entities have a common goal, they have a common goal and the more we work
[01:16:26] together to achieve that common goal, the better off both entities will be. So what this boils
[01:16:38] down to and the where I would focus step number one in this this is a long fight this is a long
[01:16:43] war is trying to make sure that the union side because you're talking about from your position
[01:16:51] in the union, the union side understands how working with corporate headquarters, how working
[01:17:01] with them will benefit the individuals in the union in the long run. So and a great book to read
[01:17:08] about this is that book I mentioned earlier with Mulalee American icon and what he told the
[01:17:15] unions was hey listen I get it you want your hourly wage to be $76 an hour you want to take care of
[01:17:24] the union that's awesome let me tell you what's going to happen in 18 months if we keep paying that
[01:17:30] we're not going to have a company anymore here's the numbers here's how it's going to work
[01:17:34] and they lower down their hourly rate to $55 now that's a huge cut and you can imagine
[01:17:42] the union thinking that's we lost we lost but Mulalee did a great job of saying no we lose if we
[01:17:51] don't come together we lose if we don't try and achieve our actual mission the mission that
[01:17:58] we're all focused on which is making great cars and being a profitable company so same thing here
[01:18:07] make sure that the areas that overlap the common mission make sure that everyone understands how
[01:18:13] achieving the common mission benefits both parties
[01:18:17] to access
[01:18:24] I've been a police officer if you have some long questions for echo Charles
[01:18:30] I mean I'm trying he's been studying him for four hours
[01:18:35] I've been a police officer for about four years I consider myself to be proactive
[01:18:42] and try to get after it every day much like many of my brother and sister law enforcement officers
[01:18:48] recently I switched to a bigger agency with a bit of a different mission I still try to be as proactive
[01:18:56] and as thorough as I can in everything that I do but I've noticed that many of the front-line
[01:19:02] supervisors in this agency want officers to be reactive rather than proactive
[01:19:07] the supervisor in particular has told me to stop working so hard and get salty
[01:19:16] suggesting that I lower my morale the question is how do I build a relationship with these
[01:19:22] supervisors while still being proactive and working hard so this is what I did
[01:19:29] when I got to see a team one I was this guy right here I was fired up
[01:19:39] I was hey oh we're doing an obstacle course today cool I'm gonna wear my rock sack with a 40
[01:19:45] pound sandbag in it and all the guys that were older were you know looking at me like dude
[01:19:50] pump breaks and you know of course what did I think those guys are are of course those guys are weak
[01:20:03] that's what I was thinking and then you know I thought to myself okay
[01:20:09] how can I how can I have influence over them how can I have influence over the
[01:20:14] Paltoon that I'm in can I have influence over the Paltoon that I'm in if everyone that's in my
[01:20:20] Paltoon doesn't like me no can you if everyone in my Paltoon doesn't like me because I'm super hard core
[01:20:34] then are they gonna steer it all in my direction no the answer's no the answer's no
[01:20:41] in fact they're gonna isolate me in fact I'm gonna have no influence over my Paltoon
[01:20:47] and that's that's a horrible thing so what did I do did I just go okay cool I
[01:20:52] could look like donuts is the deal no I didn't do that at all but I conformed
[01:21:02] right I conformed and people think oh that's weak you should conform look
[01:21:08] you are not the priority you as an individual are not the priority in a simple tune
[01:21:18] you're not the the priority is the Paltoon the priority is the mission
[01:21:26] and if we're gonna execute a mission we need to be very tight as a team so if I put my
[01:21:33] personality above the unity of the team I'm hurting our capability of accomplishing the mission
[01:21:42] especially if I realize that guys need to train a little bit harder and instead of actually
[01:21:48] doing something that's gonna move them in that direction they reject me and now I'm outside
[01:21:55] the the brotherhood of the circle and now I haven't moved them in any right direction and also
[01:22:00] now there's one guy that's in really good shape me and everyone else is going in the other
[01:22:06] direction and I have no influence over them that that's just terrible the mission is the most
[01:22:14] important thing in order to most effectively execute the mission we have to have the best possible
[01:22:20] team in order to have the best possible team we have to have trust and relationships inside the team
[01:22:26] if I violate that I'm taking away from the team I'm taking away from our mission capability
[01:22:36] now of course if there's someone that's grossly out of shape or out of standards yeah
[01:22:43] I'm gonna I'm gonna try and tighten that person up but again if someone's completely out of
[01:22:48] standards and all I do is attack them what's their reaction it's it's to step away from me to
[01:22:54] reject me but if I say hey man you know I know you got a lot of experience and you know I'm 19
[01:23:00] and I just got a bud so I'm pretty good shape but like can can you teach me some of the
[01:23:06] tactics that you know and all of a sudden I'm building a relationship with them and then I say hey
[01:23:14] you want to go for a little a little job with me after work and you know that guy's done eight
[01:23:19] deployments and he's tired and he's old but he wants to be back in shape because we all want to be
[01:23:23] in shape and he goes okay a short one and we're moving in the right direction so that's what you
[01:23:34] need to do you have to you have to back off a little bit you have to find balance and you have to
[01:23:41] focus on the team and it's better to have the whole team it's better to have 20 people that move
[01:23:48] a little bit in the right direction then have one person by themselves that's going on the right
[01:23:53] direction and everyone else is going on the wrong direction so that's what you need to do take the
[01:24:00] sandbag out of your rucksack a little bit and you know I ran with jungle boots on I did all this stuff
[01:24:06] and it didn't take me very long to realize I was not doing the right thing not making my team
[01:24:11] stronger I was isolating myself and stopped it so this guy he should like what start acting just a
[01:24:20] little bit salty or you know lower his morale appearance a little bit like to kind of fit in
[01:24:31] so to speak yeah do you want to be part of the team yeah if you're not part of the team you don't
[01:24:38] have any influence if you don't have any influence you can't move the team in the right direction
[01:24:44] if you can't move the team in the right direction the team is less mission capable that's what you're
[01:24:49] therefore yeah is to make the team more mission capable every moment that you don't do that you're
[01:24:55] doing something wrong so yes you don't have to show up I mean just imagine I was a new guy at
[01:25:03] Seethy-Mon people we show up to run the O course the O course is the O course is a really hard Opsco course
[01:25:09] and I show up with a rucksack on with a 40 pound sandbag in it as a new guy you know of course
[01:25:16] got people like that's fired up but people were like okay oh you're you're 19 years old
[01:25:26] and you just got out of Buds yeah whatever mix we don't like you so it's kind of like steering
[01:25:38] like a big van right you can't just start making big turns with the big otherwise the things
[01:25:43] gonna pin a tip over a little bit soon saying no you gotta like you can't if you gotta
[01:25:49] you gotta go slow as well I'm saying okay you guys understand anyway next question sure
[01:26:03] apparently apparently the van thing was a yeah it was correct that's a some of you
[01:26:09] that didn't understand it until we understood it was correct yeah it's exactly same thing
[01:26:14] outstanding anyway my wife and I have four young boys ages between ages three and seven
[01:26:20] we're both running successful busy careers my question is how do you forge a meaningful
[01:26:26] connected relationship that instills discipline and leadership with your kids while balancing
[01:26:31] today's demanding 24-7 corporate environment here's a couple of things make time you have to make
[01:26:40] time you have to make time where you're not looking at your phone you're not looking at your emails
[01:26:46] you have to set a good example and and I think the most important thing here for kids aged three to
[01:26:52] seven you have to make sure that they understand that what you're what you're doing and why you're
[01:26:59] doing it they have to understand look you know this house we live in we have to pay money for this
[01:27:05] house that we live in you know the food that we we have to pay money for that and in order for us to
[01:27:10] have a secure future where we can still have a house and we can still have food we need to make sure
[01:27:16] that we have money for the future that's why mom and dad work so hard it doesn't mean that we
[01:27:22] wouldn't love to sit around and play with you guys all day we would love to do that and every
[01:27:26] chance we'd get we're gonna do it but we have to be able to pay for the things we have and we
[01:27:32] have to be able to pay for our future and that's why we're working so hard right now so we can have
[01:27:37] more freedom and more time with you in the future so they have to understand why you're doing what
[01:27:43] you're doing and I'll add this so do you so do you you have to assess why you are working
[01:27:56] so much that you're taking time away from your family if you're working so much and taking time
[01:28:03] away from your family so that you can get the Mercedes S class instead of the Lexus
[01:28:13] ask yourself is that why you're doing it and what has more value the S class or the dance recital
[01:28:23] keep yourself in check yeah makes sense to any kind of got to tell the truth to yourself
[01:28:33] because you know like you could answer the email later or add another time not dinner time or whatever
[01:28:40] you know you can a got to be truthful that's what I found anyway helps that's why you don't
[01:28:46] return my emails on time next question was there time during your service in the teams that stood
[01:28:56] out above the rest and would you mind sharing a brief story not before heard on your podcast
[01:29:02] well obviously the time in the teams was being in task in a bruiser being in the battle or
[01:29:06] moddy that's pretty straightforward something that I haven't I don't think I've talked about on the
[01:29:14] podcast but it it definitely is something that I remember very clearly and that is when
[01:29:26] when seal team five came in to take over for us and so this was in October of 2006 and
[01:29:35] seal team five a task unit from seal team five came in to take over for us and we're doing the turn
[01:29:41] over with them meaning we're explaining to them the battle space and it takes a couple days for
[01:29:49] all of them to arrive they arrive in bits and pieces and so we're doing the turnover but once they were
[01:29:57] all there I did a turnover brief with them the whole group and as a matter of fact Marcus LaTrelle
[01:30:08] was in this group and this was after he had gone through what he'd gone through in him you know I just
[01:30:16] saw Marcus the other day and we were talking about this I couldn't believe he was in her body
[01:30:22] after what he'd went through and this was not long after there he was in her body as a
[01:30:28] platoon leading pedi officer and it was his group of guys and I remember one thing I just I just
[01:30:37] remember was looking at them and I was telling them you are going to take casualties and
[01:30:52] that it's sort of like that thing you see in the movies or I've talked about it reddit and books
[01:30:58] about Vietnam where you had guys that were coming in country and they got new camouflage uniforms
[01:31:04] on and they're all clean cut and there's the guys that are getting ready to go home and
[01:31:12] those guys at that time seals deploying into a situation you seals deploying the situation
[01:31:21] there are kind of unknown at least up until this point it was like okay well we're going
[01:31:25] to do missions we don't know how bad it's going to be it might be bad it might not be that's
[01:31:29] sort of was the standard those guys that were coming into a body that relieved us from body
[01:31:34] they knew and the senior enlisted guys are one of my very good friends those guys knew 100
[01:31:39] percent they went to Mike Montsource and then got on a plane and came over they knew 100 percent
[01:31:44] and so for me I won't forget looking at this group of guys that were about to start a six
[01:31:51] month appointment and telling them you are going to take casualties and that was just a blunt
[01:32:00] honest truth and they did take casualties they didn't lose anyone they had no one killed but they
[01:32:06] took some very very severe casualties and did a great job a great group of guys but
[01:32:14] that was a harsh reality to walk into for sure
[01:32:16] Roger I would do one more of these questions before the life questions will go live people
[01:32:30] what was your first combat mission and what was your role so 2003 I deployed to Baghdad as a
[01:32:42] seal-potent commander and the senior enlisted guy of my task unit was already in Baghdad
[01:32:51] waiting for us and this guy is an incredible guy just as a matter of fact his wife
[01:33:01] tells him and me that we're soulmates she jealous but anyways this guy just a incredible guy
[01:33:10] but he had been on the ground for a while and he'd done the push-up into Baghdad with the
[01:33:17] Marines and then he'd come home and then he was back over and so he was waiting for us and he was
[01:33:23] and was my opportunity we show up and I remember we hit the ground we I don't even know how long
[01:33:28] we'd been there but it wasn't long it might have been like the night we got there and
[01:33:33] there was moreder teams that were more green our base and they had been for a few days
[01:33:43] and so this guy a couple of mortars went I think anyways whatever happened he comes in like
[01:33:53] you're taking your guys out right now you gotta take your guys out and go and see if you can find
[01:33:56] you know where these things launched from and I was I was sort of not ready for that you know we
[01:34:08] been there for four hours you're taking your guys out and I'm you know what I said
[01:34:13] Roger that and you know I talked to him later like later that night he goes yeah let's just
[01:34:19] try to get you outside the wire and get some and I was like how about you give me a heads up next time
[01:34:23] so that was it I was just running that little vehicle thing and we went out look for bad guys we
[01:34:29] didn't find any and came home but that was the first kind of exposure outside the wire
[01:34:34] and back that not a very exciting story sorry there we go all right so we got some folks running
[01:34:43] around with microphones and does anyone have a is anyone having any questions okay let's see a
[01:34:51] couple hands anyways I'm gonna take this thing off so I can sort of move around and see you
[01:34:55] and our mic people I'll point to you and we'll find somebody all right let's go you right there
[01:35:01] black sweatshirt I was just trying to get him to call on me but he wouldn't wait until he took
[01:35:06] your order so you got a good team here so you were talking about childbearing before
[01:35:14] so not me personally but no you had to you were cornered um any thoughts about having a child
[01:35:23] free-ring book come out like a team childbearing book you mean how to raise kids well yeah
[01:35:32] childbearing yeah um I mean maybe not maybe this is a bad idea no no no I'll tell you what
[01:35:41] there I wrote a couple books one's called Way The Warrior Kid and one one's called Marks Mission
[01:35:46] I read them okay yeah I mean the the amount of people that have come back to me and said like
[01:35:53] as a dad as a mom thank you for writing this book because every time I read it I've learned now
[01:36:01] that means that I'm basically saying hey you need to learn you need to pull
[01:36:07] parts of the lessons out of here so perhaps I could be making more straightforward and also
[01:36:16] hey as I'm though perfect parent by any stretch but one thing that's good about putting the
[01:36:22] ideas on paper is I would start to clarify things myself and you start looking at I would start
[01:36:27] looking at mistakes that I made and say okay here's a clear mistake I didn't really recognize it
[01:36:32] before but now that I'm detached I'm looking back at it so yeah not a bad idea yeah fine
[01:36:37] answer is everything just how to discuss with your kids like all of these things are really
[01:36:42] important topics and I think the extreme ownership perspective could be a great addition awesome
[01:36:48] thank you all by you question over here you
[01:36:56] he's leaving it I like to come prepared good evening jockel good evening
[01:37:02] what lesson do you wish you'd have learned earlier in life that you now know
[01:37:17] it is disciplinical freedom I mean that is the thing that that when I connected that together
[01:37:23] in my head that that the fact that that applies to absolutely everything that's the biggest lesson
[01:37:30] that I wish I would have learned earlier in life and if I would have figured that out then
[01:37:37] I would have been doing a lot better and I would have done a lot better and I would have been a lot
[01:37:41] better of a person the thing that I try to tell kids I try to tell them that for sure the other
[01:37:48] thing that I think kids miss is kids and I miss is something that I completely missed as a kid
[01:37:55] the actions that you take now affect your future that sounds so obvious but when you're 14
[01:38:04] you just think no nothing I you know my life is only another 20 minutes so what I'm doing right now
[01:38:10] doesn't really matter so when I talk to kids I try and explain to them the discipline
[01:38:14] of freedom and then I try to explain to them that what you're doing right now
[01:38:18] really will have an impact to where you are in the future and I don't know if you listen to that
[01:38:25] podcast that I did the Warrior Kid podcast that I did number 19 about my friend Jeff
[01:38:31] and I talked about it on the adult podcast as well but you know it's a classic story I had a
[01:38:38] best friend when I was little and we separated friendship not we were still friends but we
[01:38:44] drifted apart he started getting into partying and getting into drugs and all that and I
[01:38:49] didn't and his trajectory in life just went down and I joined the Navy which was great and it
[01:38:56] put me on a good path almost involuntarily but he ended up he ended up killing himself
[01:39:03] and you know it was drugs and it was alcohol and it was just bad but while I was going through
[01:39:08] buds he killed himself and what I tried to explain to the kids on the Warrior Kid podcast is like
[01:39:13] the decisions that the little decisions that you make they matter they add up and you have to
[01:39:21] connect those dots otherwise you don't know where you're going to end up and it might be bad
[01:39:28] cool got your hand up quick bro good job I doing hi doing jacco so first I want to say thank you
[01:39:36] for being here and continuing to inspire us all I really appreciate it so little backstory I'm
[01:39:43] currently a detective and a police department in New Jersey and sitting number one on the
[01:39:47] sergeant's list looking to get promoted about marcher April so my question is I'm going to be
[01:39:54] the youngest sergeant in the department and not with a lot of experience now I've never had an issue
[01:40:00] into the department doing pretty well and as soon as that list came out and I was number one
[01:40:07] detention just rose I mean look at this kid less than five years on the job you know in his
[01:40:13] twenties and they already want to see me fail before I even got to the position so I'm trying
[01:40:20] to mentally prepare myself in that role when I already know that it's coming against me so what's
[01:40:27] your best advice for someone that is going to be you know in this position of see I was looking
[01:40:32] every position as a leadership position but now structurally I'm going to be their supervisor
[01:40:38] so what's your best advice to to me going into that situation yeah this is the same exact situation
[01:40:44] that military officers get put into military officers in the seal themes in the Marine Corps and
[01:40:50] the army and the navy your kid that comes out of college you have zero experience and you get
[01:40:56] put in charge of a department on a ship or you get put in charge of a puttune and all the sudden
[01:41:01] you're a guy with zero experience and you got a puttune chief that's been in for 16 years that's
[01:41:07] that's the way it works and so I've had to have this conversation over and over again and what we're
[01:41:13] going to do is number one we're not going to act like we know everything even if you do know more even
[01:41:19] if you have things more figured out than these guys if you go in there and act like it guess what they're
[01:41:24] going to do they're going to reject you who is this young whipper snapper young buck thinks he knows
[01:41:29] everything he doesn't know about this he doesn't know about that they'll sabotage you to make
[01:41:33] you look bad but if you go in there in your humble I'm not talking about being a pushover
[01:41:38] I'm not talking about being weak but I'm going to lean towards being humble I'm going to lean
[01:41:44] towards listening to what they have to say I'm going to lean towards saying hey you know I've never
[01:41:49] handled a case like this before you have any perspective you can help me out with this instead of
[01:41:54] hey this case is mine let me show you how it's going to be that right there you're taking a relationship
[01:41:59] in a negative direction we want to we want to we want to build a team and we want them to we want
[01:42:04] to get their respect how do we how do we get their respect we get we actually get respect
[01:42:09] this crazy sound we get respect by by being humble so if echo if echo is working for me I show
[01:42:17] up he's more experienced than me and I show up and I say all right here's what we're doing here's how
[01:42:21] we're doing this mission here's how it's going to be my way and I think he knows what's up now
[01:42:26] he knows he's on the boss what's he actually thinking who's this idiot that's had the job for
[01:42:35] three days and he thinks he's going to tell me what to do and he's going to he's going to resist it
[01:42:40] he's going to sabotage he's going to and we're going to have a bad relationship but if I come
[01:42:45] in and say hey echo really great to meet you you know I'm just checking in here I was looking
[01:42:50] at your I was checking out your your record you've been here for a long time man you really nailed
[01:42:54] some big cases that's awesome I'm looking forward to working with you I'm looking forward to
[01:42:58] learning a lot from you and boom what's his attitude towards me now hey this kids pretty humble
[01:43:05] again I'm not coming in saying I don't know anything can you please you know show me the way oh master
[01:43:12] no I'm not talking about that but just a nice respectful humble way of treating people
[01:43:17] study shop earlier than they do know the nomenclature that you're supposed to know
[01:43:22] ask good questions listen to the feedback and here I've talked about this from the podcast
[01:43:28] if he comes up with a plan and I think I have a better plan but he's got a plan that's
[01:43:32] that's pretty solid who's plan am I going to pick I'm going to pick his plan I'm not going to force
[01:43:39] my plan down his throat it makes our relationship go backwards it makes him think that he needs to
[01:43:46] compete with me I don't want to go up the echo this is your plan you come up with it you make it happen
[01:43:50] echo always jokes me he's like I know you do this stuff to me and he's like and it still works
[01:44:00] and I do you know I do it's like hey if he can come up with a plan I would rather we execute his plan
[01:44:07] because then he cares more about it it is so stay humble listen work hard
[01:44:15] get pretty cheap thanks for your service brother thank you front row shot it up quick right here
[01:44:24] you got that thing up quick a game first fall juggle thank you for being out here
[01:44:30] in New York it's great to finally see you live I just want to give you respect to your
[01:44:34] reliability elaborated some on communicating as a family you said you're going to put some
[01:44:38] work on set out regarding that stuff hold on second bro my hearing's not great slow down hit
[01:44:43] it with me again all right quick and simple a top three rules on raising kids from ages three to
[01:44:51] nine really getting that sort of attitude and still while they're still young so not about the
[01:44:56] family like dynamic not about managing just the kids attitude yeah it's with kids first of all you
[01:45:02] got to remember this is the hardest thing for parents to deal with is your kid is not going to be
[01:45:10] who you want them to be they're just not they're humans and they have their if that was the
[01:45:18] truth all of my kids would be the same type of kid and they would all you know you could just
[01:45:24] here's what they all do they're not they're not your kids are going to be different and your
[01:45:29] kids are going to be different from you they might be a little bit better than you at some things they
[01:45:32] might be worse than you do other things so what you have to do is first of all get that idea out of
[01:45:38] your head that being said you can definitely provide guidance and you can definitely put
[01:45:47] them in guide them in the right direction but what you don't want to do is make every decision
[01:45:55] for them what you don't want to do is only let them do what you tell them to do they've got
[01:46:01] to learn to make decisions otherwise they can't go into the world and defend for themselves
[01:46:05] they've got a suffer consequences of their bad decisions otherwise they can't defend for themselves
[01:46:09] in the world so you have to set this before you have to you have to like let them brush up
[01:46:16] against the guardrails of failure you have to let them tie their on you you have to let them spill
[01:46:19] the milk and the more you make or allow them to do for themselves the better human beings they're
[01:46:32] going to be the more that you do for them and force on them and impose on them the less they're
[01:46:40] going to know for themselves and the more they're going to rebel against the values that you're
[01:46:48] putting forth to them again it's a dichotomy and I'm not saying hey like your kids do whatever
[01:46:52] whatever they want when they go outside that box is given a nice pick box when they go outside of
[01:46:58] that you've got to bring them back in and you've got to explain to them why you're bringing them back in
[01:47:02] they got to understand that there's the reason they're not allowed to play in this area is because
[01:47:08] there's bad people there or there's danger there it's not just because I said so so you develop
[01:47:14] these relationships with your kid you guide them but you don't direct them and you let them
[01:47:20] be as much of a leader as they can be and that's the best thing you can do for them.
[01:47:28] Thank you can I add one more thing to to that which actually jockel opened my eyes to this and it like
[01:47:37] like your kids are always watching you like always what so if you're yelling at mom or yelling
[01:47:42] that people on the phone or I don't know doing stuff you're doing stuff that you don't want them to
[01:47:47] do you can say hey don't do this they'll be like cool but once they kind of get the opportunity they're
[01:47:51] like I guess this is kind of how because that does it especially with the yelling thing and
[01:47:56] losing like how do you do it stress and stuff that's brother they'll jump right on that that's what
[01:48:02] I really noticed when actually when he opened my eyes to it I was like ah okay you know when
[01:48:06] you know sometimes you get kids or your kids how many kids you have oh okay all right
[01:48:14] well you're planning ahead okay all right there you go keep this in mind then because a lot of the
[01:48:19] terms you're like all your three year old or you be like dang where did they how did they pick that up
[01:48:24] I didn't teach him that and the thing is you probably will have taught him that just by doing it on
[01:48:30] your own you know yeah so they're always watching you so that helped me I think a lot
[01:48:36] tight to kids but tighten your game up a little bit around the kids let's see really tall hand
[01:48:46] back there you thank you so a very specific example then my son he's three I would love for
[01:48:55] him to get into Brazilian jujitsu just like me which I also got into thanks to you two gentlemen thank
[01:49:00] you very much so how do I encourage him without pushing him without you know just getting him
[01:49:07] into it really you have to make it fun you have to make it fun and it is much better for it to
[01:49:15] be fun once a week then for them to hate it three times a week the kid that hates it three times
[01:49:23] a week and you think I'm doing it my favorite I'm doing her a favorite because I got her in their
[01:49:27] web she likes it or not she's three years old bro the best possible thing you can do is not make
[01:49:38] them train jujitsu right now it's make them enjoy jujitsu right now I did not do this well with my kids
[01:49:47] I didn't it's horrible when my when my especially my daughters my daughter when they were very young
[01:49:54] it was jujitsu jujitsu jujitsu we were doing they were doing jujitsu six days a week
[01:50:05] they were like six and that was that was that was part of it let me tell you what I did
[01:50:13] that's worse what what's worse is I was like okay you're also going to compete because
[01:50:19] competing makes you better and it gets worse because then it was oh when I take you to compete
[01:50:25] since I'm the coach I'm going to put you in a higher weight class I'm going to put you against
[01:50:33] older kids and you know what if you lose look if you lose it doesn't matter because you're
[01:50:41] going to be tougher so so just go out there do your best if you lose don't worry about it's
[01:50:46] going to make you tougher so my daughters go to compete in jujitsu tournament jujitsu tournament
[01:50:52] what happens to them they get beat they get beat by someone that's older they get beat by someone
[01:50:58] that's heavier is that fun that sucks what do I think what is idiot think oh you're getting tougher
[01:51:09] and so by the time they were 10 it was like I don't want to do any of this crap anymore and
[01:51:18] it got to a point when I was like okay look this is ridiculous I realized the mistake that I
[01:51:24] made and I just had to back off and luckily my son made it through that time period where he
[01:51:31] he kept training all the time and became very good at jujitsu and wrestling but
[01:51:38] with the girls I I didn't do it right so find a good school where the jujitsu is fun
[01:51:48] don't force it down there throw it let me tell you one more really quick story my son had a friend
[01:51:53] who was like you know his run in me and when he was six years old I said yeah we'll bring
[01:51:59] your son to jujitsu let him try it he tried it at six years old he didn't like he tried it one time
[01:52:03] I'm like it got chill in the crime he tried it at age seven hey we tried it again didn't like it
[01:52:10] hated it tried it at age eight didn't like it hated it age nine has dad trained his dad
[01:52:16] had started training his he kind of got to look at like oh that's pretty cool by the time he was
[01:52:21] nine and he tried it he liked it and he liked it because he liked it and he was then old enough
[01:52:27] to make the decision want to train and started training hard and he got good really quick
[01:52:32] it it wasn't like oh he missed those four years of training they didn't make a big difference
[01:52:38] is my point they don't make a big difference so the most important thing you can do as a parent
[01:52:44] is make it fun for your kids make working out fun make jujitsu fun make school fun make these things
[01:52:53] enjoyable make let them win you know put them in positions where they're gonna win and I'm not
[01:52:58] saying every time because you do have to learn how to lose let them learn to lose when they occasionally
[01:53:03] let them learn to lose when they get a loulder but make it fun for them that's the key
[01:53:13] I'm gonna eventually get balcony up there but I guess ju in the back go
[01:53:19] jaco my questions on the other end of the spectrum for the police officer I'm a battalion chief in
[01:53:26] the fire department 28 years on the department how do I relate to the 19 year old can you really
[01:53:34] a story that you worked with a 19 year old new seal and you're trying to get what to happen I
[01:53:41] wanted to develop that relationship with them you talked about the relationship above me as a
[01:53:46] leader how do I develop that relationship for the newer people below me the best way okay when we
[01:53:53] start talking about relationships and I I mentioned this earlier what a relationship is as a relationship
[01:53:57] is trust and that's what a team is a team is a bunch of people the relationship that all trust each
[01:54:02] other how do I develop trust with someone that's below me in the chain of command what I did this is
[01:54:08] what I did to make this happen as a platoon commander as a task unit commander as I was in charge
[01:54:13] of training is those young guys that are coming in I gave them responsibility I put them in leadership
[01:54:21] positions I remember the first time I took over a platoon with a platoon commander got fired
[01:54:26] and we had a training operation that night and I said I said a platoon chief I said hey who's like a
[01:54:33] a square away jute really junior guy and he gave me a name and I said okay he's gonna run this mission
[01:54:37] tonight and the platoon is like whoa wait what are you talking about this kid's gonna run the mission yep
[01:54:42] and all of a sudden what's the kid thinking wow this guy trusts me to do this I'm gonna do a
[01:54:50] good job for him and since he trusts me I'm starting to trust him and the more you do that the
[01:54:59] more you push down that responsibility and you let people lead and you put trust into them the
[01:55:04] more they're gonna trust you as long as when something does go wrong you don't chop their head off
[01:55:12] when something does go wrong you say hey look let's let's take a look at it let's see we can learn
[01:55:16] from it and you know what probably my fault because I didn't give you very good guidance
[01:55:21] so let's learn from it and we'll try it again you know what you're gonna run the same
[01:55:25] mission tomorrow night I know you can do this that's how you build that trust up that's how you build a team
[01:55:31] hand came up quick right there it's amazing that you can tell the one pointing out
[01:55:43] jaco echo thank you for everything that he's given us
[01:55:48] acknowledging that we all have secrets jaco what would you need to see happen that would change
[01:55:56] your mind about a run at public office what let me finish what would be that sugar event to make you say
[01:56:07] okay public office stand by to get some
[01:56:11] I'll finish when sake white frankly you have a nation of troopers both foreign and domestic
[01:56:27] that believe and know that you're qualified to lead and ready to lend their support
[01:56:32] um what would it take there is a line somewhere there is a line somewhere where where I would
[01:56:49] feel like okay the you know the country needs me it's it's a pretty distant line it's it's
[01:57:01] that world is so I don't want to use the word corrupt but but but because that's not what I'm talking
[01:57:20] I'm not talking about like that kind of corruption and there's corruption for sure but you know you
[01:57:24] compare the corruption that we have to the rest of the world and it's very nice but there's a different
[01:57:30] word that I can't quite capture there's there's dishonesty there's I don't mind the chaos
[01:57:39] um some selfishness um here's what it is I think in order I like I like when things go wrong
[01:58:00] I know that sounds crazy but one of my biggest problems is that I get when things are going
[01:58:07] good I get really bored pretty quickly and I just like oh yeah that's cool oh we hey the business
[01:58:13] is doing this like my business like hey we're doing this and I'm like oh that's awesome we're
[01:58:16] going right there we're cool what can I look at next like I get I get kind of bored when things are
[01:58:22] going well and when things are going bad I love it I really like when things are going bad and so
[01:58:32] in the government things don't get that bad and for me to put my time and effort towards
[01:58:42] something all that you know it's really focused I would get bored very quickly because you know
[01:58:47] to be like hey you know what we're not doing too bad and so until there's something bad
[01:58:55] that I feel like okay it's time that's kind of what would would make me roll in that direction
[01:59:01] it seems like a miserable life to me it seems like a miserable life it seems like a life where
[01:59:09] you're constantly putting up a facade and I don't have the desire to do that you know I never
[01:59:15] got interested in going into the CIA or anything like that because I never wanted to live
[01:59:22] that kind of life and it does I'm not saying it's bad I mean the guys work with them and they're
[01:59:26] awesome but it's just not me and I don't like to live that way and it seems like there's a lot of that
[01:59:33] except the fact that if we got into a position as a nation where things were really bad and we needed
[01:59:42] some we needed to take action then I feel like I would step into it but man I hope we don't get
[01:59:50] there let me put you that way I hope we don't get there and I don't think we will but I appreciate
[01:59:55] that's not porch and I'm sorry red jacket first off thank you for everything you do and then
[02:00:08] my question is who are your role models growing up and like what qualities do they have
[02:00:12] well my first legitimate role models that I looked at instead okay that's a person that I can emulate
[02:00:24] that was when I got to the seal teams up to that point I was looking I was a confused kid that was
[02:00:30] looking at this you know this person and that person but I didn't really but even though even I
[02:00:36] wasn't confused enough to be like all I'm going to be like that person and follow what they're doing
[02:00:39] I would look at people like that seems pretty cool that seems pretty cool and so it wasn't till I got
[02:00:44] into the seal teams and there were some people that you instantly when I checked into the seal team
[02:00:49] one I'm like that guy's awesome I'm gonna that person right there is awesome I'm gonna do my
[02:00:54] best to emulate that person and there was probably five or seven people at seal team one when I got
[02:01:01] there that I stole as much as I could in terms of how to behave and and that was it you know
[02:01:09] a guy named Master G faculty who was super just ultra professional and everything and I was like
[02:01:14] he's so professional no one can say anything to him he's a professional like I'm going to
[02:01:21] I'm going to be like that there was a couple other there was other guys that unfortunately
[02:01:27] Master G faculty died so I'm using his name but other guys that I just looked at and said wow that
[02:01:33] guy's awesome so I didn't really have like those kind of role models until I got to the teams you know
[02:01:43] okay balcony is there anyone on the balcony microphone style right there up in the cheap seats
[02:01:51] Jaco echo thank you for your podcast Jaco thank you for the work that you you work with Jaco
[02:02:04] and didn't podcast also thank you to the men and women of the service president's future in past
[02:02:10] I come from a corporate environment working doing IT support now my recent role was where I was
[02:02:16] responsible for supporting 40 to 80 people pretty much solo and with that I had a manager remote
[02:02:22] you know I had a good work in relationship with him he's former military so he would tell me do
[02:02:27] certain things within the environment which I would do but then his manager would come down and visit
[02:02:32] and sometimes give me contradicting situations or orders so what do you do when you have your
[02:02:39] boss telling you one thing his boss your boss direct response report telling you do something
[02:02:44] contradictory yep the pretty straightforward if my boss's boss comes to me and tells me to do
[02:02:50] something I'm like hey I just want to make sure that you know that this is what I've been told to do
[02:02:54] and then they say yeah I don't care what that guy says and you go okay Roger that and then he leaves
[02:02:59] you go hey direct boss here's what's going on boss came down and told me to do this I'm here
[02:03:05] I work for you you're my boss and I want to tell you what's going on do you want me to proceed
[02:03:10] or do you want me to stop I want to keep you informed here's why I want to I want to do the right
[02:03:17] thing and this is what's going on so just take the information from the boss the the boss is boss
[02:03:24] got it have you told you know my boss that nope don't care okay you don't care fine hey boss
[02:03:32] your boss is telling me to do this I want to let you know it's going on it's obviously a
[02:03:36] a tenuous situation because then this guy up above the higher guy in the chain of command
[02:03:43] I'm like oh this you didn't do what I told you to do hey look I'm just trying to make sure everyone's
[02:03:47] informed and and that's the way that's the way things run smoothest if everyone's informed I'm
[02:03:53] here to support can you guys talk to each other so I know what I'm supposed to be doing down here
[02:03:59] you you got to kind of be the person that that connects the dots here to the best of your ability
[02:04:09] no problem all right let's say you're in an organization and you really want to see it succeed
[02:04:14] but it's being led by someone who is not only steering it in the wrong direction they're doing it deliberately
[02:04:22] and you're not really sure if you can negotiate with them what would your course
[02:04:26] my course of action if there's someone above me in the chain of command that's steering us in the wrong
[02:04:33] direction I'm going to do my best to influence and persuade them if I can't do that I'm going to do
[02:04:38] the best to mitigate the risk down the chain of command and the strategic risk I'm going to do my best to
[02:04:43] mitigate it and while I'm doing that I'm going to try and inform the other people around that person
[02:04:50] of the situation that's going on I'm going to build relationships with the CEO with the CEO with the
[02:04:57] CEO with the CEO you're talking about or if it's the batissio whoever it is I'm going to build some
[02:05:03] relationships with other people so we can get that person under control the other thing we have to
[02:05:08] remember is sometimes at the bottom we don't understand what the real strategy is and so my first
[02:05:16] thing is like hey boss can you explain to me why we're doing this because I it doesn't seem right to me
[02:05:20] for the following reasons I want to be able to support what you're saying can you tell me why we're doing it
[02:05:24] this way so sometimes they say oh yeah it's because of this I should explain that sometimes they say
[02:05:28] wait a second what do you mean my strategy is not working down on the front lines they don't know
[02:05:33] no one's telling them so you have to communicate with them to make sure that that they understand
[02:05:40] to make sure that you understand what direction you're supposed to be heading and to make sure that
[02:05:44] they understand why it's problematic on the front lines if all of that fails and they're just
[02:05:49] looking the telling you to be quiet and they're moving forward in something that's going to
[02:05:53] really be detrimental to the organization we got to start trying to figure out how to flank that
[02:05:57] person and and building a a alliances with people that can try and get us going in the right way
[02:06:05] thank you and of course there's you know there's situations where you know especially in the
[02:06:11] business environment like if you're in a ship and the ship is sinking and you've sounded the
[02:06:15] alarm and you've tried to you've tried to plug the holes and you've told everyone and they're still
[02:06:21] just staying on board the sinking ship without making any corrections there are times we got to
[02:06:25] go you know what this ship is sinking and I'm not going to stay on it that can happen we can't you can't
[02:06:32] save every sinking ship you can't and you got to know when it's time to go okay I'm going to take the
[02:06:37] lessons learned I'm going to go somewhere else thank you yes first I want to thank you because I am a
[02:06:46] stage four cancer survivor and
[02:06:53] and in my darkest hours that a lot of people can't comprehend you were there with me your voice
[02:07:08] your everything still to this day I mean this planet equals freedom is a common phrase in my family
[02:07:15] over the most monumental to the most ridiculous things like letting the dog out at the same time you know
[02:07:20] so I want to thank you for that with that being said I have at one point planned my own funeral
[02:07:28] didn't think I was going to be here for my kids you know the worst part of anybody's dreams you
[02:07:34] know nightmares and then to be at the place where I am right now and not knowing obviously I'm
[02:07:41] young and you know what the future holds the nobody's naive how you've been in those similar positions
[02:07:48] just not health wise but you know facing death and everything else how do you switch from that
[02:07:54] mindset of like you said when things are going really bad I'm freaking awesome like I kick ass like I
[02:08:01] really do and then when things are kind of calm I'm like what do I do now like how am I going to
[02:08:07] you know even when you were just saying like your last line sometimes I think like you just speak to me it's
[02:08:11] so creepy that like my last cameo was Friday I shouldn't be well today but I am because I knew I
[02:08:20] had to be here you know so it's like stuff like that and then when you said that you know at the end
[02:08:34] of your podcast that you know I'm going to live life I'm going to live my days how did you get from that
[02:08:40] transition from you know possibly I don't know if I'm going to come out of this battle I don't know
[02:08:45] if I'm going to come home to okay I'm here life speaking great let's party and then in between like
[02:08:52] did you have any like how did you do how did you get from the darkest places to the brightest places
[02:08:59] and then bring everything my problem is is I want to bring I've learned my lesson like I've
[02:09:04] learned what I had to have learned now and now to bring it forward with me but not to let it define me
[02:09:11] if that makes sense for me and and I actually gave this answer to Sam Harris because Sam Harris said to me
[02:09:24] you know Joko you you you you talk about combat as your fondest memories and it you know the
[02:09:35] the best thing that's happened in your life it's the hype on your life which is all true and he said but
[02:09:40] then you talk about war being awful so which one is it and I said to him I said have you ever known
[02:09:51] anyone that has had cancer terminal cancer and made it through have you ever known anyone that that's
[02:10:01] happened to and he's like yes and I said when you talk to them many times they say I'm glad that this
[02:10:10] happened to me number one because it proved I could take it number two it's better me than one of my
[02:10:18] kids and number three now that I know how dark he can get I truly appreciate the light in the world
[02:10:34] that's what combat is and was for me that's what it was it was dark and horrible and I wouldn't
[02:10:44] wish on anyone just like you wouldn't wish cancer on anyone but if I can give them a little
[02:10:54] knowledge a little bit of a glimpse into what it is just like when you stand up here people
[02:11:02] clap when you said that people are clapping because they get to see a little bit of it and they go home
[02:11:09] tonight and they think what about that girl what about that girl she's fighting she's living
[02:11:23] and I'm gonna live too
[02:11:25] maybe that's why I had to have cancer that's how I look at things now I don't pretend to have the cognitive
[02:11:38] capacity to comprehend the mysteries of the world but maybe you're right and maybe you're here
[02:11:50] to let us know that it can get dark but it will get light again absolutely and thank you
[02:12:01] awesome
[02:12:09] awesome
[02:12:13] yes
[02:12:21] hey Jaco thanks for being here I've been in the army for three years now and for the past year I've
[02:12:28] been thinking about putting in a packet for special forces selection so I guess I just wanted
[02:12:34] to ask you to talk a little bit about when you joined the seal teams and what did you do to
[02:12:40] physically and mentally prepare yourself and generally why did you why did you decide to join
[02:12:48] man I wanted to do that since I was a little kid when I heard that this I heard that the seals
[02:12:53] was the toughest training and that's not the necessarily true thing all the training is hard there's
[02:13:01] the special forces the the marsawc units the raiders the air force PJs and CCCs it it
[02:13:08] it's everyone's got their awesome special operations units and the training is all hard and
[02:13:14] all for when I heard the seals the toughest training is okay that's what I want to do
[02:13:18] what do you do to get ready for you know what you got to do to get ready for you know army
[02:13:22] guess what you're going to be humpin' a rock you're going to be doing force marches you got to be
[02:13:25] over the run you got to build a nav you got to be able to do push ups and pull ups and and dips
[02:13:29] and rope crimes and offscores that's what you got to do you got to train hard you got to train
[02:13:34] as hard as you possibly can and then you have to tell yourself that you're not going to quit no
[02:13:42] matter what happens no matter what happens you're not going to quit no matter what happens
[02:13:52] because they're going to play a little psychological games on you like like let's say they go
[02:13:56] all he's in good shape he's you know we can't really touch him physically he's in really good shape
[02:14:00] so now you know what they're going to do they're going to say oh you know you failed this academic test
[02:14:06] you're not smart you're not really smart enough I mean you seem like a good guy but you're not
[02:14:10] really smart enough you're the kind of you're the kind of person that will get someone killed
[02:14:13] you're going to make a mistake you're going to start attacking you psychologically or if you're
[02:14:17] psychologically strong but you're physically weak they're going to be like hey you're the kind of
[02:14:21] person that won't be on the carry me out combat we don't want you they're just saying that don't quit
[02:14:33] that's it don't quit go get some all right um
[02:14:45] thank one more yeah we're looking I want to have some time to hang out sign books we got to be out
[02:14:52] here by 11 so we're getting close go ahead man front row
[02:15:05] Jacko thank you for speaking tonight just a quick question I've I work in a corporation here in
[02:15:10] New York and one of the toughest things with being an analyst here is just the fact of like when you actually
[02:15:15] escalate or you know which which kind of feels like defeat but also at the same time you want to
[02:15:20] make sure you live in somebody else to know what's going on so just want to ask you about that thank you
[02:15:29] for me I look at a problem if I think I can contain the problem then I'm going to try and
[02:15:34] contain the problem I recognize and I weigh the risk of if this is wrong what's going to happen
[02:15:42] can I manage that can I control it can I absorb the impact of that if I can't absorb the impact of it
[02:15:48] then I know it's like okay this I need to bring this up I need to send this up the chain of
[02:15:52] care if it's something that I know I can absorb the impact of and I can explain myself and it will be
[02:15:56] sense that won't have been a strategic loss or a major error then I'm going to try and hang onto it and in
[02:16:04] the beginning I'm going to be I'm going to air towards sending it up the chain of command as I
[02:16:10] start to trust myself and I get better at my job I'm going to hang on to more but again I'm always
[02:16:16] going to weigh is this something that I can contain or I can absorb if it goes wrong and if it's
[02:16:23] something that I can hey I'm going to run up by somebody so I think it's you just got to weigh that out
[02:16:29] and once you weigh that out make it a decision and live with it all right go one more
[02:16:38] here microphone anyone is there a mic right there
[02:16:50] somebody who's recently recently proposed to somebody would like to spend the rest of my life with
[02:17:04] somebody who's married and has from my knowledge gone away for extensive periods of time
[02:17:12] from the partner what is your tips to building a mortar proof marriage that's going to last
[02:17:20] a long time yep the first thing I'll say is you know you want to develop the you want you
[02:17:28] you want to make sure and encourage your wife to be emotionally independent emotionally independent
[02:17:38] because there's going to be times when you're not around and if they're dependent on you emotionally
[02:17:45] you're not there they're going to they're going to be hurt and they're not going to be able to
[02:17:49] handle it so you want to help them build that resiliency where when you're not around they know
[02:17:57] how to handle things independently like the broken water heater in the flat tire they can do that
[02:18:03] and you you go through those things you you build that confidence with them and then also
[02:18:09] the emotional independence where what they have is trusting you that you're gone but you're coming
[02:18:16] back and you're going to be there for them always that's number one number two is
[02:18:26] straight up extreme ownership that's what it is when something is going wrong in your marriage
[02:18:34] it's your fault it's your fault the minute you turned your wife and you say you shouldn't
[02:18:43] done this you're wrong and you're you're taking that relationship in the wrong direction
[02:18:48] when you say hey look I'm trying to figure out how I made you do what you did I don't want to let
[02:18:55] that happen so taking ownership when things go wrong that's what you've got to do that's what you
[02:19:03] got to do thank you awesome awesome and with that once again I can't thank you all enough for
[02:19:25] coming tonight and I know that you're just not here tonight I know that if you're here tonight
[02:19:30] you're here all the time you're with us you're supporting us you're supporting everything that we're
[02:19:36] doing you're supporting the you're representing representing representing with the store with the
[02:19:43] jockel store with the with the origin you you guys are in the game you're getting the books and and
[02:19:48] most important you're you're listening and you're with us and the podcast it's it's a lot of work
[02:20:02] it's a lot of work a lot of work goes into it but I get more out of it than anyone
[02:20:12] I get more out of doing this than anyone and the thing that drives me to keep doing this
[02:20:22] is not just what I get out of it but also that you all are there and that you all are listening
[02:20:34] and that you all are sitting there with us and that you guys are here in the same thing that I'm
[02:20:41] hearing and you're learning the same things that I'm learning and I know that we're together
[02:20:56] and I know that that sounds kind of weird that sounds kind of crazy but
[02:21:02] we are we are together we're hanging out we're moving forward and together we're stronger
[02:21:19] and even though we aren't strong enough to bring back days and even though we are strong enough
[02:21:34] to bring back the sunset at least we can sit here together and we can be humbled and
[02:21:54] mystified by this life and together we can go out and we can live it I think that's
[02:22:13] all we've got for tonight so thanks for coming down and until next time
[02:22:19] this is echo and jockel.
