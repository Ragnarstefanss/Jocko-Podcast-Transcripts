we'll share some food with you but you got to come and you got to come and surrender proper it was now the morning of the 12th of April I had been ordered to have my lines formed for the ceremony at sunrise it was at chill gray morning depressing to the senses we formed along the principal street we were the remnants also Massachusetts main Maryland Michigan Pennsylvania New York Veterans and Replace Veterans cut to pieces cut down consolidated divisions into brigades regiments into one gather by state origin back to their place of birth this little line quintit quintessence a metasite coasts of porters old core of gains mill of maveran hill man of near blood borne made near by blood shed those facing us now thank God the same our earnest eyes can scan the busy groups on the opposite slopes breaking camp for the last time taking down the little shelter tents and folding them carefully as precious things then slowly forming ranks as for unwelcome duty and now they move the dusky storms forge forward into gray columns of march on they come with the old swinging root step and swaying battle flags instructions had been given and when the head of each division column comes opposite our camp our bugle sounds the signal and instantly our whole line from right to left regiment by regiment in succession gives the soldiers' sallutation from the order arms to the old carry the marching salute Gordon at the head of the column writing with heavy spirit and downcast face catches the sound of shifting arms looks up and taking the meaning wheels superbly making himself in his horse one uplifted figure with the proud profound sallutation as he drops the point of his sword to the boot toe then facing to his own command gives word for successive brigades to pass us with the same position of manual honor answering for honor our part on our part not a sound of trumpet nor role of drum not a cheer nor word of whisper of vain gloring nor motion of a man standing again at the order but an odd stillness rather and breath holding as if it were the passing of the dead they fix bayonets stack arms then hesitantly remove cartridge boxes and lay them down lastly reluctantly with agony of expression they tenderly fold their flags battle worn in torn blood stained heart-holding colors and lay them down some friends at the rushing from the ranks kneeling over them clinging to them pressing them to their lips with burning tears and only the flag of the union greets the sky what visions thronged as we looked into each other's eyes here past the man of antitum the bloody lane the sunken road the cornfield the burn-side bridge the men whom stone wall Jackson on the second night at Frederick's bird banged lee to let him take and crush the two core of the army of the petomic huddled in the streets in the darkness and confusion the men who swept the eleventh core at chancellorville who left 6,000 of their companions around the bases of colps and cemetery hills at getty's burg these survivors of the terrible wilderness the bloody angle at spotsylvania the slaughter pen of cold harbor the whirlpool of Bethesda church here comes cobs George Elegion which held the stone wall on Mary's heights at Frederick'sburg close before which we piled our dead for breastwork so that the living might stay alive here to come Gordon's Georgians and hoax north Carolinians who stood before the terrific mine explosion at Peter'sburg and advancing retook the smoking crater and the dismal heaps of dead ours more than theirs huddled in the ghastly chasm here are the men of megalons honten and scales who broke the fifth core lines on the white oak road and were so desperately driven back on that four-learn night of march the 31st by thrice decimated brigade now comes Anderson's fourth core only bush rod and bush rod that johnson's division left and this the remnant of those we fought so fiercely on quaker road two weeks ago with wise his legion two fears for its own good here passes the proud remnant of rambson's north ransom's north Carolinians who were swept through five forks ten days ago and all the little that was left of this division in the sharp passages at sailors creek five days thereafter now makes its last front ap hills old core half now at the leads until had gone too far forward ever to return the men who poured destruction into our division at shepherd's town forward and tedom in 62 when hill reported the atomic the patemic running blue with our bodies the men who opened the desperate first days fight at getty'sburg wherewithstanding them so stubbornly our Robinson's brigade lost one thousand one hundred eighty five men and the iron brigade alone one thousand one hundred and fifty three these men of half division here two losing two thousand eight hundred and fifty men companions of these now looking into our faces so differently now the sad great pageant long street in his men what shall we give them for greeting that has not already been spoken in valleys of thunder and written in lines of fire all over the banks of Virginia shall we go back to gains mill or maveran hill or to antitum of Maryland or get hisberg of Pennsylvania deepest grave and a wall for here is what remains of kursha's division which left forty percent of its men at antitum and at getty'sberg with barksdale and stems brigade tore through the peach orchard rolling up our rolling up the right of our gallant third core sweeping over the proud batteries of mass attuces big allow and philips we are under the smoke we saw earth brown and blue with prostrated bodies of men and horses and the tongues of overturned cannon pointing grim and stark in the air then in the wilderness and at spots of vignor kursha again in deeds of awful glory and thereafter for all their losses holding their name and fame until fate met them at sailors creek where all but these with kursha himself and it will you and so many more gave up their arms and hopes all indeed but manhood's honor with what strange emotion I looked into these faces before which in the mad assault river on reefs say we at June 1864 I was left for dead under their eyes it is by miracles we have lived to see this day any of us standing here now comes the sinew we remnant of fierce hoods division which at getty'sberg we saw pouring through the devil's den and plumb run gorge turning again by the left our stubborn third core then swarming up the rocky bastions of roundtop to be met there by equal valor which changed leaves whole plan of battle and perhaps the story of getty'sberg is this picket's division this little group left of those who on the lured last day of getty'sberg rested level crossfire and thunder bolts of storm to be strewn back drifting wrecks where after that awful futile pitiful charge we buried them in graves of furlong wide with names unknown man again in the terrible cyclone sweep over the breastworks at five forks met now so thin so pale purged of the mortal as if knowing pain or joy no more how could we help falling on our knees all of us together and praying God to pity and forgive us all you know i don't know if you can capture the emotions that these guys must have felt on both sides at this juncture So with a fervor of devout joy as when perhaps the old crusaders first caught sight of the holy city of their quest with an uproaring of heart that was half pagan half prayer we dash forward to the consummation a solitary field piece in the edge of town gives an angry but expiring defiance we press down the little slope through a little swamp over a bright swift stream our advances already in the town only the narrow street between the posing lines and hardly that there is wild work that looks frightening but not much killing nor even hurting the disheartened enemy take it easy our men take them easier it is a wild mild fusing earnest but not deadly earnest a young orderly of mine unable to contain himself begs permission to go forward and dashes in sword flourishing as if he was a terrible fellow his demonstrations seemingly more amusing than resisted for he soon comes back hugging four sabers to his breast speechless at his achievement new guy going in so you can see the looking fetter army is kind of fallen apart and these guys are charging in expecting a fight and there's just not that much of a fight and then this suddenly rose to our sight another form closer on front a soldierly young figure handsomely dressed and mounted a confederate staff officer undoubtedly to whom some of my advanced lines seem to be pointing my position now I see the white flag earnestly born and it's possible purport sweeps before my inner vision like a rave of morning mist he comes steadily on the mysterious forming gray my mood so whimsical sensitive that I could even smile at the material of the flag wondering where in either army was found a towel and one so white but it bore a mighty message that simple emblem of homely service wafted hitherward above the dark and crimson streams that never can wash themselves away the messenger draws near dismounts with graceful salutation and hardly suppressed emotion delivers his message sir I am from general Gordon general lead desires a cessation of hostilities until he can hear from general grant as to the proposal of surrender what word is this so long so dearly fought for so feverously dreamed but never but ever snatched away held hidden and eloof now smiting the senses with dizzy flash surrender we had no rumor of this from the long messages that had been passing between grant lee for now these two days between behind us surrender it takes a moment to gather one speech sir I answer that matter exceeds my authority I will send to my superior general lead is right he can do no more all this with a forced calmness covering a tumult of heart and brain I bid him wait a while and the message goes up to my core commander general griffin leaving me mazed at the boating change even here he's trying to remain calm like purposely forced calmness now from the right come foaming up in cavalry fashion two forms I had watched from a way beyond a white flag again held strong a loft making straight for the little group beneath our battle flag highborne also the red multi's cross on a white field that had thrilled hearts long ago I see now that is one of our cavalry staff in the lead indeed I recognize him chrono wittaker of custer staff and hardly keeping pace with him a Confederate staff officer without dismounting without salutation the cavalry man shouts this is unconditional surrender this is the end then he hastily introduces his companion and adds I am just from Gordon and Long Street Gordon says for God's sake stop this infantry or hell will be to pay I'll go to Sheridan he adds and dashes away with a white flag leaving Long Street's aid with me the captain's cry hold the rebels want to surrender the more men want to be there and see it still to the front where the real fun is and the forward takes an upward turn for when we do succeed in stopping their advance we cannot keep their arms and legs from flying to the top of fences and haystacks and chimneys they clamber to toss their old caps higher in the air and leave the earth as far below as they can deroll general Gregory Gallops up to inquire the meaning of this strange departure from a custom discipline only that lee wants time to surrender I answer glory to God roars the grave and brave old general your legs have done it my men he shouts galloping up cap in hand generously for giving our disobedience of orders and rash exposure on the dubious crest true enough their legs had done it had matched the cavalry as granted mid-it had caught around lee's best doings and commanded the grand halt but other things had done it the blood was still fresh upon the quaker road the white oak ridge five forks farmville high bridge and sailors creek I said I will take responsibility you shall have all the credit let me take your brigade for a moment so that's in two pages you've got giving ownership and taking ownership in two pages in two paragraphs really and by the way I'll take responsibility you'll have all the credit this dude is like deal deal and deal uh then Sheridan was by my side in a moment very angry you are firing into my cavalry here we get blue on blue he exclaims his face darkening with a checked expletive I was under a little pressure too and put on a bold air then the cavalry have got gotten into the rebels place one of us will have to get out of the way what we have as do general don't you fire into my cavalry I'll tell you was the fierce rejoiner so we got this freaking mayhem going on fast forward a little bit more they kind of sort that out I plunged into my business to make up for a minute it's lost time my men were still facing too much across areas front and getting into the range of his fire we had got we had got to change that and swing to the right down the rear of the enemy's main works it was a whirl every way was a front and every way was a flank the fighting was hand-a-hand I was trying to get the three angles of the triangle into something like two right angles and it swung my left well forward opening quite a gap in that direction when a large body of the enemy came rushing in from that flank and rear they were in line formation with arms at something like a ready which looked like business I thought it was our turn to be caught between two fires and that these men were likely to cut their way through us rushing into the ranks of my left battalion I shouted the order prepared a fire by the rear rank my men faced about at once disregarding the enemy in the front but at this juncture our portness visitors threw down their muskets and with hands and faces cried out we surrender running right up upon and almost over us I was very glad of it the more astonished for they outnumbered us largely that's the kind of turn of events I mean this is our war we just just it was a slaughter just think about that last podcast the things that the description he's giving on those battlefields but if we as a nation can go through that that insane violence and at the end of that at the end of that at the end of killing each other whole sale slaughtering each other at the end of that the very men that that fought each other that killed each other those very men can stand and salute each other and respect each other and decide that we should stay a union if we as a country can get through that then I only can hope that we can move past some of the bickering that we have today and hold up this flag and unify all of us together to continue to provide a place in the world with freedom for all so thanks for listening thanks for your support in what we're doing like I said if you want to calm out you want to hang out with myself and Jason and the rest of the Esslorn front team you want to walk these battlefields you want to feel some freaking emotions you want to have a spiritual experience come and check out these events that we do we got in May 11th and 12th and May 13th and 14th the Gettysburg and we're going also to little big horn in August 16th 17th and then another session 18th and 19th come and check it out if you can't go with us give read these books think about what these people went through think about what they overcame it's um it's history and we should never forget we should never forget this this history that we have in this country and what we've been through we've been through a ton we can't forget that should keep us together what else echo Charles greedy to be because the old school big confessions are you actually the small thing I thought it's not not quite as serious but I will say this so you know it's what is it about when you have like enemies or even people who just don't like each other and they're in the one the any form of like enemy and then they go through like all this like ups and downs and they fight each other and and then at the end like they become friends or whatever maybe reconcile and they become friends but what is it about that that makes everyone feel so good afterwards I would say part of it is the shared struggle right we've been through some shit I've been through some shit I think you rise on your elbow strike a match and with smarting streaming eyes read the brief thrilling note from Sheridan like this as I remember quote I have cut across the enemy at apomotics apomatics station and captured three of his trains if you can possibly push your infantry up here tonight we will have great results in the morning end quote ah no more sleep the startling bugle notes the ring out to the march word is sent for the men to take a bite of such as they had for food the promised rations would not be up till noon and by that time we should be where they don't even know they are there men shivering to their senses as if written out of rizn out of the earth but something in them not of it now sounds the forward for the last time in our long drawn strife and they move these men sleepless, subtrolous, breakfastless, sore-footed stiff-dueened sense-be-numbed but with flushed faces pressing for the front some hard men freaking hard they march eventually they arrive on station I ride straight to Sheridan a dark smile and impetus gesture are my only orders forward into double lines of battle past Sheridan his guns as cavalry and on for the quivering crest for a moment it is a glorious sight every arm of the service in full play cavalry artillery infantry then a sudden shift shifting scene as the cavalry disengaged by successive squadrons rally under their bugle calls with beautiful precision and prompt the two and sweep like a storm cloud beyond our right to close in on the enemy's left and complete the faithful envelopment we take up battle, Gregory follows in on my left it is a formidable way front we make the scene darkens in a few minutes the tide is turned the incoming wave is at high flood the barrier recedes in truth the stone wall men hardly show their well-proved metal they seem astonished to see before them familiar flags of their old antagonist not having thought it possible that we could match our cavalry and march around and across their pressing columns and I don't think I did a good job of laying out the way that went but these soldiers had marched to keep up with the cavalry and it got in there in 29 miles in a very short period of time their last hope is gone to break through our cavalry before our infantry can get up neither to Danville nor to Lynchburg can they cut their way and close upon their rear five miles away are pressing the second and sixth core of the army of the Potomac it is the end they are now giving way but keep up good front by force of old habit halfway up the slope they make a stand with what perhaps they think a good omen behind a stone wall I try a little artillery on them which directs their thoughts towards the crest behind them and stiffens my lines for a rush anxious for that crust myself crest myself but now comes up ord with a positive order don't expose your lines on that crest the enemy of mass their guns to hat to give it a raking fire the moment you set foot there I thought I saw a qualifying look as he turned away but left alone youth struggled with prudence my troops were in a bad position down here march airies having gone according to warnant orders Griffin and Crawford were to go by Bartlett's way but Griffin had sent for Bartlett with draw from his position and joined the division ready to mass on point road so this is just you can see why this is just mayhem it's total mayhem and it's mayhem from micro management is what it is mayhem from micro management it is difficult to keep keep a clear head and trying to see this into this model now we can imagine the state of warnant's mind but this was not all within the space of two hours warn received orders involving important movements for his entire core in four different directions these came in rapid succession and in the following order one to retrench where he was on the wider white oak road and be ready to fight in the morning this was from grant to fall back with the whole core from the white oak road to boiten and send a division by this road to relieve Sheridan this was also from grant number three Griffin to be pushed down point in road but the rest of the core airies and Crawford to go across the fields to the crump road but the way Bartlett had gone and attack the enemy in the rear who's opposing Sheridan this was from meet this required a movement in precisely opposite direction from that indicated in the preceding order which was now partly executed airies had already started number four needs advice to send these troops backed by Quaker Road 10 miles around and give up the rear attack number five to these may be added the actual final movement which was that airies went down the boiten road and Griffin and Crawford went by dirt road across the country to crump road as indicated in meet's previous orders there's one more thing general grant thought it necessary in order to make sure that Sheridan would have complete an absolute command of his troops to send a special message asking me to make that distinct announcement to Sheridan this is craziness the orders which came to general one that night were a two an amazing degree confused and conflicting this is charging no blame on any particular person we will call it if you please the fault of circumstances but of course the responsibility for the evil effects of such conditions must naturally in military usage and ethics rest upon the officer receiving them and when he is not allowed to use his judgment as to the details of his own command it makes it very hard for him sometimes indeed it is not very pleasant to be a subordinate officer especially if one is also at the same time a commanding officer but in this case I think the trouble was the result of other recognizable contributor toary circumstances if I might not say causes so he's got some other reasons why this stuff happened this is just it's his maim but if it happens we're going

they're all there they're kind of a list in order of the books I recommend you read now wood all things being if I was to restack that book that that thing would they be adjusted a little bit there'd be some adjustments this book would be further up there I was never a huge civil war guy until probably like five years ago I don't know it seemed like it was too far ago whatever no no like don't gave me wrong it's not like I wasn't interested in civil war at all i get a think of the slack and now we get to apomotics apomatics fast forward a little bit i'm about to speak of what came under my observation in the action to apomotic apomatics courthouse and the circumstances attending the surrender of the army of northern Virginia April 9th 1865 so now there are 20 25 miles or so from five forks the battle that they were just in this is a week later eight days later something like that they had to march that that time he says the fifth court had a very hard march that day made more so in the afternoon and night by the lumbering obstructions of the rear of ords tired column by courtesy given the road before us the incestant checkfreading our men almost to mutiny we had been rushed all day to keep up with the cavalry but this constant checking was worse we did not know that grant had set orders to the fifth court of march all night without halting but it was not necessary for us to know it after 29 miles of this kind of marching at the blackest hour of night human nature had called a halt dropping by the roadside left and right wet or dry down went men as in a soon swoon officers slid out of the saddle loosened the girth slipped an arm through the loop of a bridal rain and sunk to sleep horses stood with drooping heads just above their master's faces all dreaming one nose not of what of past or coming possible or faded scarcely as the first broken dream begun when a cavalry man comes splashing down the road and vigorously dismounts pulling from his jacket crumpled note the sentinel standing watch by his commander worn in body but alerted every sense touches your shoulder or to sir hey I'm used to doing this job down in the weeds I'm going to get down the weeds that was what he did trying to change the front with Crawford's division under fire it was a difficult thing he put his personality into it which is what you just said Jason just as shared and would do and did in this very fight there's a whole section that covers some of that criticism about Warren and his subordinates and and Chamberlain goes on to say these accusations against the conduct of each of Warren's divisions while susceptible of being magnified and manipulated so as to produce a certain forensic effect are of no substantial weight even if true in the sharpest sense so even if Warren's subordinates were totally jacked up look he's saying look you can create you can look in the back and say like oh these guys were bad this guy did this wrong this guy did that wrong you can produce a certain forensic effect but even if that's true in the sharpest sense they would be overstrained and uncalled for considering how the battle ended and by whom it was mainly fought in a military and highly proper sense general Warren was responsible for the conduct of his core and ultimately for that of each of his divisions there you have it you got people that work for you you got departments under you got divisions underneath you got platoons or battalions or companies underneath you you are responsible for what all those people do there are two ways in which such control might be exercised by prevention or by correction so i'm either going to say jayson and we take somewhat gravely this compliment of our new commander of the army of the james at last after pardoning something to the spirit of liberty we get things quiet along the lines one the clock comes no answer from lee nothing for us but to shake hands and take arms to resume hostilities as I turned to go general Griffin said to me in a low voice prepared a make or receive an attack in ten minutes it was a sudden change in tone of our relations and brought a queer sensation where my troops had halted the opposing lines were in close proximity the men stacked arms the men had stacked arms and were resting in place it did not seem like war we were going to recommends but willful murder but the order was only to prepare and that we did our troop foreign good position my advance line across the road and we stood fast and tensly waiting I had mounted and sat looking at the scene before me thinking of all that was impending and depending when I felt it coming upon a strange sense of some presence invisible but powerful like those unirfully visits told of an ancient story charged with supernatural message disquieted I turned about and there behind me riding in between my two lines appeared a commanding form superbly mounted richly accrued accrued of imposing bearing noble countenance with expression of deep sadness over mastered by deeper strength it is no other than Robert e.lee and seen by me for the first time within my own lines I sat immovable with a certain awe and admiration he was coming with a single staff officer for the great appointed meeting which was to determine momentous issues not long after by another in leading road appeared another form plain unassuming simple and familiar to our eyes but I think it is like it's like like after you fight for so long it's almost like you lose you almost forget kind of like these men like minimal things that or evidently minimal things that you're quote unquote fighting for and you start remembering all the commonality stuff the start of movie says I halted my line and wrote ahead through the woods to some high cleared ground the southeast and corner of a large field known as Sidnor Field along the opposite edge of which I could see strong skirmishing along Crawford's front and turning suddenly looking across broken scrubby ground could see Aries troops engaged in a confused world of struggling groups with fitful firing so he's maneuvered into position where he can see what's happening there was Aries fighting alone and that was not in the program meaning that wasn't part of the plan there was Griffin down there that was an order enough for me and I took the responsibility of looking out for the left instead of the right where my last orders committed me I pulled my my brigade out of the wood by the left flank telling Gregory to follow and sending to Bartlett to let him know what I was doing pushed across a muddy stream and up through our veen toward Aries halfway up Griffin came to meet me never more welcome he gave the look I wanted and without coming near another forward wave me to follow up to the head of the ravine and to attack on my right along the bank where hidden by brush and scrub the enemy had a line perpendicular to their main one on white oak road and we're commencing a slant fire and Aries direction Griffin road passed me toward Warren and Bartlett so there's a bunch of things going on there number one and so the two leaders ride the corps commander and his last visible Colonel colors aloft reckless of the growing distance between them and their followers straight for the smoking line straight for the flaming edge not hesitating at the breastworks over they go one with swelling tumult of soul where the passion of suffering craves outburst in action the other with obedience and self devotion love like stronger than death over the breastworks down among the astonished foe one of whom instinct over mastering admiration aims at the foremost a deadly blow which the noble youth rushes forward the parry and shielding with his own breast of his certain of his uncaring commander falls to earth bathing his colors with his blood need more be told do men tarried such a point one crested wave sweeps on another broken rolls away all as lost and all as one slowly worn in returns over the somber field so that's just an unbelievable scene you know it's just an unbelievable scene if you tried to make that an a movie it wouldn't seem realistic that this guy Richardson gets told hey you need to charge he says I don't think I should do that without proper orders his boss says these are your orders go and as he takes off towards the melee the overall leader without saying a word just grabs his flag and joins him by his side once they get to the enemy lines somebody takes aim at Warren and Richardson basically jumps in front of he says blow and you're getting emotional I'm freaking get emotional reading and freaking book today right like that's all happening what does that mean is if I'm getting emotional reading a book is that taking the same emotional toll or having the same emotional impact as it is if I watch a movie is it the same as if it if I have like something happened in my life what's the difference probably the movie is probably similar not in life because life kind of like the emotional part of life kind of continues right because your life is actually kind of okay yeah we can throw them if we want to make them if you want to make them whatever subscribe to the park a juggle underground.com once again I don't know what's getting I don't know who's getting shut down for what I don't know what there's some crazy stuff going on in Canada right now people are getting shut down they're getting their finances halted that's what's happening right now this isn't like me talking about some dystopian future where things have gone awry but but to the thought as much inspiring as Lee in his splendor and his sadness it is grant he too comes with a single aid a staff officer of shared in slouched hat without cord common soldier blouse unbuttoned on which however the four stars high boots mud splashed to the top trousers tucked inside no sword but the sword hand deep in the pocket sitting his saddle with the ease of a born master taking no notice of anything at all all his faculties gathered into intense thought and mighty calm he seemed greater than I'd ever seen him a look of another world about him no wonder I forgot altogether to salute him anything like that would have been to live a little staff officers are flying crying Lee surrenders although with some kind of strength left among those worn and famished men building the hills around the springs of apomattox who rent the air with shouting in uproar as if the earth and see a join the song are men did what they thought their share and then went to sleep as they had not as they had need to do but in the opposite camp they acted as if they got of hold of something too good to keep and gave it to the stars besides they had supper that night which was something of a novelty for we had divided rations with our old antagonist now they were by our side as suffering brothers so they're well in truth long street had come over to our camp that evening with an unwampton moisture on his martial cheek and compressed words on his lips I got goosebumps from that man you know I tell that story I was at trade-ed and like the mount situations going on and the guys are getting all their ass kicked with paintball and everything and no one's making any decisions and I walked over to this one badass E5 and I looked down and I go hey bro I go what do you think you should do right now he's like we ought to freaking stone that building over there and get some freaking get some cover and then you start to get kind of exhausted in a way where you're like just like I said like what are we doing like you kind of forget what you're fighting for you just so habitually caught up in the fight you know you have a mole you're kind of like bro it's all good you know the world's good it kind of kind of takes you to a psychological area where things are good like there's no yep a new view of him surely and amazingly if that's such a great case for taking ownership and apologizing when you screw something up he's talking a little bit about about about the the personalities and the attitudes and one thing he's talking about Sheridan so this is sort of a detached moment he says Sheridan does not entrench he pushes on carrying his flank and rear with him rushing flashing smashing he transfuses into his subordinates the vitality and energy of his purpose transforms them into part of his own mind and will he shows the power of a commander inspiring both confidence and fear as a rule are core and army commanders were men of brains rather than magnetism they relied on brains in others war and was one of these he was well capable of organizing an entire plan of battle on a great field he would have been an admirable chief of staff of the army so he's good again this is the personality of war and war and was like not a dynamic charismatic individual he was good at planning but when I came to know the truth of it all I saw that instead of your colors being lost they were eternally saved not laid down but lifted up not captured nor surrendered but translated the shadow lost in substance the flag it is the symbol of the country's honor power law and life it is the instant of loyalty the bond of brotherhood for those who stand under it a token and an inspiration hence it is held sacred by the soldier as in great moments it is also by the citizen all which that flag symbolized you had illustrated and impersonated had absorbed into your thoughts and hearts if I should not rather say itself had absorbed your thoughts and hearts your service and suffering into its own deeper meaning and dear honor now it had done all a simple could do you had stood for it all now the supreme moment had come nothing could be averted nothing could be resisted nothing could be escaped that was an awful moment passing that of death it seems to me then a new soul is born no thought of yielding up the token of the country's honor enters the heart of any one of you though it has fulfilled its ends though you are to go to prison and death your kernel common don'tless commander still bids you break the staff that had borne it aloft and tear that symbol single as your souls into many pieces as you had bosoms and shelter them with your lives less that flag be touched by hostile hand or triumphed over living man lost there is a way of losing that is finding when soul over master's sense when the noble and divine self over comes the lower self when duty and honor and love immortal things bid the mortal perish it is only when a man supremely gives that he supremely finds that was your sacrifice that is your reward when we talked about the surrender it was him describing it so there's some forgiveness this was also interesting late that night I was summoned to headquarters where general Griffin informed me that I was to command the parade on the occasion of the formal surrender of the arms and colors of Lee's army he said the Confederates had begged hard to be allowed to stack their arms on the ground where they were and let us go pick them up after they had gone so that was their plan the Confederates said hey let us just leave our weapons and we're gonna bail but granted not think this quite respectful enough to anybody including the United States of America and while he would have all private property respected and would permit officers to retain their side arms he insisted that surrender that the surrendering army as such should march out in due order and lay down all tokens of Confederate authority and organized hostility to the United States in an immediate presence of some representative portion of the Union army Griffin added in a significant tone that grant wish to the ceremony to be as simple as possible and that nothing should be done to humiliate the manhood of the Southern soldiers so there's like a little balance there I must speak plainly we are starving over there for god's sake can you send us something we were men and we acted like men knowing we should suffer it for ourselves we were too short rationed also and had been for days but must be for days to come we sent over to that starving camp share and share alike for all their with ourselves again that's like amazing to the sort of mutual respect almost instantly to try and help out these your enemy how about long streets coming over by you're not sending a staff officer or anybody else he's going to say hey bring my guy some food hey you're jerking everybody around right now that's detached because the guys that are they're making these calls they don't realize it they're just coming up with a bunch of good ideas and they've forgotten what's happening at the end of that whip that they're rate waving around continues on here rapidly changing plans and movements in affecting the single purpose for battle for which battle is delivered or what a soldier must expect the end the ability to form them wisely and promptly illustrates and test military capacity but the condition in this case rendered the execution of these peculiarly perplexing orders had to pass through many hands and in the difficulty of delivering owing to distance and the nature of the ground the situation was called which called for them had often entirely changed hence some discretion as to the details in executing a definite purpose must be accorded to subordinate commanders decentralized command thank you the details in executing a definite purpose the purpose needs to be definite this is what we're doing the details of execution let the subordinate commanders do it look for a moment at the summary of the orders worn receive that evening even after we hit reached white oak road affecting his command in detail one to send a brigade to manage the enemies rear before shared but he had already and so it's the supply chain like all these things are going to have an impact so we got to know what's the most important thing you want done number three these supreme commanders being as such a distance from the field of operation on the 31st of March that was impossible to have a complete mutual understanding when orders were put into effect you're not up there and you're making calls from the rear with the gear number four time lost and sequence confused by the difficulty of getting over the ground to carry orders or obey them yeah he doesn't say doesn't give nori literally ask the question will you follow me and then goes leadership by example and whatever kind of relationship and respect he had from his troops that when they see him go they go his words were a question his act in order on the brave fellows go with a cheer into the hurricane of fire their beautiful flags sways gray footh gracefully aloft with the spring of brave youth bearing it lighting the battle smoke three times it goes down to earth covered in darkening eddies but rises ever again passing from hand to hand of don'tless young heroes then bullet torn and blood blazing it hovers for a moment above the breastwork while the regiment goes over like a wave this I saw from my position to the left where I was pressing on the rest of my command the site brought upon me that I snatched time to ride over and congratulate Glen and his regiment as I passed into a deeper shadow of the woods I met two men bearing his body the dripping blood marking their path they stopped to tell me I saw it all but I wasn't going I didn't start going deep not like you know for me was always kind of number one nom closest memory number two world war two number three Korea because we didn't hear as much about that as we needed to so civil war there has been people ask me about the civil I've got a stack of books stack of books ready for the podcast that I but he had already a divid of his own accord set Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division the nearest troops by the nearest way you already had the problem handle to send this brigade by the point in road instead of the crump this was a very different direction and a very different tactical effect but impossible to recall Bartlett warnant sent Pearson already on boyton road with a detachment of Bartlett's brigade three send Griffin's division by point in road to shared and then draw back the whole court of that road Griffin's division being widely and far scattered and impossible to be collected for hours warnant sends airies division nearest and most disengaged four to send airies and Crawford by the way of Bartlett had gone and insisting on Griffin's going by point in road this would cause airies and Bartlett to exchange places crossing each other no longer difficult and needless and then when she was over there was like hmm might be a good time to leave might be good like you're not gonna be able to leave now you know you know you should probably leave you should probably leave and we let things that are sort of oftentimes if you put them in a bigger picture totally irrelevant I mean that's what was shocking about the brits and the Germans having a freak up playing soccer is like those guys didn't give a shit what was going on with some freaking king somewhere they didn't care what I why do I care about this land over here in France I live in Germany bro you live in England like I don't care the French people live here let them live here what are we doing so we get wrapped around some dumb shit and we had now come to the edge of a wide field across the road and the works on the enemies right known as the Gillum field here I came to share it in Griffin my troops all up in well in hand a sharp cavalry fight was going on in which some of Erie's men and my own had taken part when our line was checked at the last angle Griffin had ordered one of Crawford's kernels to advance the Colonel a brave well-balanced man replied that where soldiers as good as Griffin's men had failed he did not feel warranted in going in without proper orders very well I ordered you in says Griffin without adding that he did it as commander of the corps
