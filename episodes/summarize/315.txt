Like when I read this and I read that all these 68% of people avoided the draft like I read that it doesn't it's hard for me to compute that it's hard for me to compute like being a man and being like, Oh, a bunch of people are going to go fight a war. Like, well, how do you know, like even, I'm not saying no one's going to, but then you're you're counting for like so many people, so many different types of people, by the way. I don't really, it seems like because there wasn't social media because there wasn't 24-hour news cycle, if you lived in Ohio, and you were going to join the army, you only saw the other people in Ohio, and probably the people that you hung out with were like, yeah, well, you're joining the army, you're from Ohio and where Americans are, we're joining the army, oh, you got drafted cool. Going crazy he says this during my lifetime in moments of extreme stress anxiety or panic I have done things that are dumb and destructive it is humbling and instructive to remember my own episodes of dysfunction when I consider the insane actions of some project hundred k men who were young typically nineteen or twenty and burdened with more anxiety and vulnerability than I will ever experience that's a freaking great point you think about the things that you've done when you're stressed out freaked out and you've done dumb things behave badly made bad decisions because of that and you're a smart person imagine what these other people I don't know more stress in a combat scenario. Then again, think about it because you could see like one of these people, especially if you're used to just like handling people and that with that kind of numbers, you know, we need a thousand guys here. And when you kind of take it as a whole, the reality sets in where it's like, no man, this is going to leave people straight up dead, confused, freaking like worse off, you know, because all of the unintended consequences. And also, if you say, hey, here's, we're going to war and you cannot explain why and the top of this goes, hey, dude, what are we doing going, and as soon as you got people going, hey, right? But if you think back to, let's say a 20 year old person who isn't like you, like maybe maybe maybe they do have my maybe their middle class and they got normal stuff, quote, I'm quote, normal stuff went on. But just like the idea of, hey, if I pitch the draft, you like this, listen, where at war we need people, everyone's going to have to serve. And just like this, just like imposing the draft, that's why people is like, don't you think everyone should serve in the military? So it's like a, it's like a, this constant balancing act because sure you can have more people, but you can't lower the standards all the way down so that more people actually hurt because there are a month people who are incapable, whatever. I mean, that's a that's a spectrum to where like isn't that like a typical thing people might say about the criminal justice, right where it's like. But blood pressure is like that seems like something you can just sort of cure with like even like the weight thing. You know, like, if you're going to the, I don't know, what you're going to do. You'd be like, you know what, don't really like it, but it seems like the fair thing to do, cool them down. So it really clarifies that those did the difference in perspective because look, if I'm a little guy who's not very strong and I, and each one of our, and I'm, and we got the cut-up log and everybody and you know, you got, I don't know, how many guys in a year and a boat crew with other guys that are your same height or very similar. In city, as totalitarian, communist wanted to enslave us and trample upon our rights, we must be strong men, obedient men, and we must be willing to sacrifice like Washington's troops did at Valley Forge in the darkest days of the Revolutionary War, or like Eisenhower troops did on the beaches of Normandy. I was like, you know, you know, you're just a little bit like I was like a thing like and other people like his friends or whatever would do that as well. Or maybe now it's like less like official, you know, or something like that. All these people avoiding, we covered that one book called Company Commander and the guys going through Army O.C. Army Officer Cannon at school and they're like, where do you want to go? But like I said, like it's not a vacuum and it's not, you know, people are different. So let's get some, you know, some other guys doing some other stuff, we're sure that, you know, one of these three guys could probably do the job of eight of these other guys, but they're over here doing, you know, busy doing other stuff, so let's get eight more guys. In infantry units, the poor were joined by many men from working class families described by historian Christian G. Appies as, quote, the 19-year-old children of waitresses, factory workers, truck drivers, secretaries, firefighters, carpenters, custodians, police officers, salespeople, clerks, mechanics, miners, and farm workers, and, quote, men from lower economic levels, porn working class comprised 80% of the combat forces, while the remaining 20% came from the middle class, half of them serving his officers. But when it comes with that booster, whatever you kind of accept it, then you kind of embrace it, then it's kind of like, yeah, you know, it's working kind of a thing. But again, think about how it was probably like for anything like, hey, what if your neighbor, what if hey, look, I grew up on, you know, fifth street and proud. Or you know, I was like, like, fuck, you know, I was either, I come to jail or come here. And then you go to war and you realize that people are going to get killed and you're realizing to kill some bad people and you realize that some civilians are going to die as well. But you wonder like, I wonder if that was on purpose that they're kind of like, oh, yeah, maybe all these other consequences or did they really kind of think that. And she's like, oh, like, let's do something else wherever he's like, oh, no, no, math is fun. So, and it's like, damn, now I got to risk my life for something I don't really know about, not necessarily that I'm against or for nothing like that. So steel man argument for that is kind of like, yeah, like there are success stories and those success stories kind of play out exactly how they're purporting. Yeah, and again, it kind of goes back, you know, in a small way, maybe in a big way to the, that like marketing campaign idea. And you mentioned it earlier too, right, where that'll kind of make the general society unhappy, where it's like, hey, these are like, they have important roles in our society, because they're educated and all this stuff. Most project 100,000 men were graduated from basic training, even if the even if company commanders had to cheat to get them through, after leaving basic training, project 100,000 men were sent to AIT, which is advanced individual training to learn impotu tactics or if they were lucky specialized skills, such as radio telephone operator RTL, perhaps. So there's got people getting drafted, you got people getting told, hey, you're gonna get drafted bro, you might just, so they never would have enlisted voluntarily. Because psychologically, like if it's all one log and you kind of can't tell who's putting out and who's not, doesn't that kind of add to the team building experience where you kind of got to trust the guy? And he's like, all in do it, you know, and then she tells she was like kind of bored with it.
