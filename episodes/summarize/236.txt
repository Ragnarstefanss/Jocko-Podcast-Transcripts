I got books on swimming workouts how to swim how to you know get more hydrodynamic this kind of thing how much swimming did you do in the projects not really any I mean like in the summer there's a pool right near it the pool is three feet and then they have a little baby pool so that was another thing about walking change when when I would go to the pool I mean I mean on several occasions I mean James if you're out there listening you almost killed me a couple of times and I'm like kidney he would you know there's like a ladder you can walk out he would get me under there and stand on me and hold me there like trying to drown me and the worst feeling I ever had was like just you know I'm in the water and like I'm bouncing like bobbing because it's too deep Yeah, I would say, you know, everyone has that, um, pivotal point in their life where like, I guess you can say like, in a sense, it's lost like it's not like, you know, a fairy tale and like, you know, I basically, death was introduced really quickly, you know, early on in my life. but if you start jujitsu at whatever you know 24 or 31 or whatever you start later in life to get the reps in for the take-down game when you're a little bit more fragile and compared to a kid that wrestled you know six years old eight years old ten years old through high school had you know hundreds of tournaments hundreds of hours in the on the mat doing take downs and by the time like that's whether you have seen so dominated by wrestlers because they are they have that in thing just embedded they don't they don't need to learn that that's embedded in them they know how to get that take down they know how to get out the take down they know how to scramble there's a huge part of that wrestling comes in and that's what's when you start taking that and you just make replace wrestling with sombo and now you've been doing that your whole life which has take downs like like you said Jeff occurred me have ever wanted to do that it's what I think it's important to know like you know in spec ops a lot of guys are gonna use dip true into faculty because of that reason it's like a little bit of you know catapomber is not so everything well it was good enough but my vision you know I you know glasses so one of the one of the guys there that worked in one of the dive motivators Steve Collins that another really pivotal person in my life he was like hey man if you really interested in going the sealed training you know we can work on switching your orders and you'll have to work as you know for us as you know the dive motivator check I was like Because I was like, you know, I, um, just really curious, you know, there were a lot of things in my mind that, you know, that I didn't really know my mom, like, I think I should, like, should have. Because you know what it is actually like you make a good point where it's like, and people got to point this out like people's like that's, I mean that that's obviously like good that you say that. I thought he like I thought the guy died of exhaustion or something in the ring I don't know if you remember that one it was me and the Armenian guys are cranking the Armenian music on boomboxes and stuff it was so crazy it was not dude and the cool thing is that's like the caro-present crew like that's them so like when caro-present was like oh yeah and and you know what a lot not a lot of it let's just say some of it was wrong some of it like some of it got taken to a point where it was not good for morale it wasn't good for unity you know some of the hazing got to a point where you're like hey that that's not that's not okay like that's wrong some of it's good you know some of it's and so I got my blue belt from hoist Gracie and never had trained with him at all but got my blue belt there to do the tournament because like two years you know go in the blue belt division but I had never trained with the geek like when I got there I was like you know everyone had Gizmo and I was like we had all has done no geek and my first opponent was Craig Cole fobby was first black belt done here I didn't dip sense that was my one and only jealous that was your opportunity does it like jam you like when you dip and you haven't ever does it like you feel like actual effects right like waste job like it jams you up kind of heart to dip you know it's I'm not quitting it's like I don't even have control the situation and uh essentially uh at that point there like you know you can't continue the training you're going to get killed you know they had a someone of you classes ahead who had died out in San Clemente you know he did a swim a four mile oceans swim came out of the water and just fell down and I just felt sick on the swim like nauseated and really weak and tired like not normal and when I got out of the water you know we just got hammered because we filled the swim and then I had to go in and you know uh to uh um these are just getting hammered and so it was uh that was like on a Thursday it's in the weekend and then um Tuesday comes along and I was like it's a good way to get good condition for judo you know learn something different and that that's another thing I remember is when you came to my house to fight me I was like well what what what what would you uh you know if you if we were going to fight how would you what would you do like how would you start it and you did some weird capoetta stuff And you know how, like you're like, okay, I want to go to this, I don't know, chicken restaurant or something, or maybe even a place where maybe the experience there is more significant, like, you know, a martial arts place or whatever. I don't know what happened that we had all the gear like we got full scuba tanks with air and brought them into the dip tank and just murder each other I don't know that's not legal you know like that's not okay you can't do that that's like if you if you're changing yeah especially like early when he showed up he would be would go hard he was there he was there to win every time it's you know I look at that now in hindsight you know having have some had some judo experiences well judo the the um the way people attack is um I would say they're trying to make you tap there they're not looking for you to tap like you know I have I've even traveled in certain areas in Asia you can no one taps to chokes it's just So when like what you're talking about is essentially like, you know, if you have, you know, you have kids, right, where let's say, you know, I don't know, you have a goal to get somewhere to do something. I know I know everything you know like it's like I know the alphabet you're gonna be like buzzing kind of hardcore right were you buzzing from the dip is what I'm saying I didn't know it's not like I felt like I bought a motor and pain and just thinking like this is horrible yeah don't you think it's a little bit too like the culture over there is a little bit different just in terms of like yeah Russian culture is very different why because they're getting not more often like the guys with the leg but like you say you see everyone with a leg rap meaning they kind of maybe have an injury or hurt legs yes leg locks and so you know on some time off I got a big thing of that weight gain powder I got a bunch of milk like whole milk and uh I would order two for one dominoes pizza and I was just constantly drinking the milk with the weight gain I would eat a pizza before I went to sleep with the weight gain and the milk sent my clock for three in the morning and eat the other pizza you know it's it got disgusting now I had at a certain point like I'm not a pizza fan anymore hey you know um do they have like any kind of you know like any other places I can train you know I want to learn more and I was the biggest thing for me as I was kind of surprised you know I expected to walk through the quarter deck and just get ripped apart and start becoming a different you know you know like the James Bond movie echo Charles you know where the door opens and there's people training that was another big deal like George White Steve Collins um struck the Roberts these guys really made a difference because they were like hey you know they weren't like you know show me everything And, uh, these guys would, every time they would see me, you know, they were high on something and they would make the sound like, you know, and when I heard that, I was like, I, you know, I would start running. but back then you went to army jump school there for a penny soldier and that's where seals get like a horrible I guess kind of a horrible reputation because like you're coming out of buds back in the day you'd go to airborne school which airborne is a very conventional school to go to like everyone it like a lot not everyone but a lot of people go to the go to the army jump school what how can what can you create really is what it falls down to there's a creativity aspect that's another thing that you kind of excel at with jiu jitsu is a there's the creative aspect of kind of creating moves and creating series that work really well together how much how much you went like I remember you know when I would see you because because eventually you know we weren't all training at fob you was anymore we were training at different places and so when I'd see you would always be like you'd be deep into yoga you'd be deep in a kettlebells or you'd be deep into Bulgarian bag or you'd be deep in the sombo you were always going down these different paths to add to your to add to your repertoire of moves and movement and strength and conditioning They're not like, they're not like, they're not like, they're not like, they're not like, they're all get over your quitter. I'm gonna try anything I can you know just looking at the world seeing what everything's about you know I think uh people who do come from areas like the projects in a sense you're kind of sequestered and you're not maybe seeing the big picture of things and I will say that's something for everyone you know you're in your environment and no one ever sees the whole picture maybe we see most of the picture but not the whole thing Um, I'm not, uh, one thing about my school work, I'm not like the best student, like going to school and, you know, getting grades and stuff like that. And that's the way, I mean, I think I guess you could say like Bruce Lee, you know, he was kind of an early adopter, and you know, if it doesn't, you know, he had some great quotes of which I can't think of any right now, but it's a good, what's useful, this guy at the right. So I was like, you know, and also I wanted to, I always wanted to try different things, you know, and see, you know, what's that like? and I'm thinking about you know getting out and he's like well you know Steve was like you know you should maybe check out a tournament
