[00:00:00] This is Jocopotcast number 195 with echo Charles and me, Jocob Willick. Good evening,
[00:00:06] you're good evening. How much? How much is enough? I mean, how much does a person have to give
[00:00:21] before they can say that they've given enough? I think that answer is different for
[00:00:33] different people. There are some people that don't give very much at all. Maybe they
[00:00:39] give just enough to be called a participant at best. When some people don't even get there,
[00:00:49] they aren't even in the game. But then if you go to the other end of the spectrum,
[00:00:58] there are other people who give and give and give and make sacrifice after sacrifice. And that's
[00:01:06] still isn't enough. They remain ready and willing to give even more to make more
[00:01:18] sacrifice. As sacrifices, that many of us can't even comprehend. And then they look up and say,
[00:01:27] what else can I do? These are rare people. And it's an honor to have one of those people here
[00:01:41] with us tonight. One of those people who has served with honor, deployed repeatedly to war zones
[00:01:48] and Iraq and Afghanistan, a man who suffered devastating wounds, lost both of his legs, but that didn't
[00:01:59] stop him. He never felt sorry for himself. Instead, he used the pain to make himself stronger and tougher
[00:02:11] and better. And he represented America in the Paralympic Games, bringing home the bronze metal
[00:02:21] for rowing. He wrote a bike across America from Maine to California to raise money for
[00:02:26] veteran causes. But that still wasn't enough. So to raise even more money and raise more awareness
[00:02:33] for veterans charities, he ran 31 marathons in 31 days. And yes, you heard that correctly, 31
[00:02:42] marathons in 31 days. But he decided that he still hadn't given enough. And after his
[00:02:55] all this, all these accomplishments, his service in the Marine Corps, he still wants to serve. So now
[00:03:04] he's taken on another challenge. He is running for the 10th congressional seat in his home state
[00:03:13] of Virginia, which it might not be the toughest battle that he's ever fought, but it will certainly
[00:03:21] or almost certainly could be the nastiest. But you know what? He is game, of course, his name is
[00:03:31] Rob Jones. He's a Marine. He's a wounded warrior. He's an Olympian. He's an inspiration to everyone's
[00:03:38] ever met him. He's been on this podcast twice before number 92 and number 1116. So if you haven't
[00:03:45] listened to those, go back and do so. But if you have, well, here he is. Once again, my brother, Rob Jones.
[00:03:54] Rob, welcome back, man. You know, I would say that I've been asked that several times. Have
[00:04:01] you given enough. And I always say, it's not going to be enough until six Marines carry me in a
[00:04:09] coffin, put me in the ground in Arlington. So I'll make you do it. So what led you to make this decision
[00:04:19] to make this political run? What, what, what the hell happened? Because let's face it, signing up for
[00:04:27] politics. That that is like signing up for just extreme punishment, extreme mental punishment of
[00:04:40] people coming after you all the time. People don't care about your, you know, the way it affects you,
[00:04:46] the way it affects your family. I mean, it gets crazy in politics. So what was it that made you
[00:04:54] say to yourself, okay, you know what, it's time for me to do this? Yeah, you know, I've just noticed over
[00:04:59] the last few years the deteriorating environment in Congress and the federal government. And
[00:05:09] I disall that we need leaders there. And the only way we're going to get leaders there is if
[00:05:14] leaders step up and they put themselves into that arena, take the risk of, you know, being under fire
[00:05:23] from these people, you know, kind of harkens back to, I think I talked about this last time.
[00:05:29] When I told it, I talked about proof the lane, kind of how I was, you know, when you
[00:05:33] use searching for IEDs, you have to go out there and you have to step on the ground and make sure
[00:05:39] that there's not an IED there. So you just kind of step on it and if it blows up, well, guess what,
[00:05:44] there's an IED there if it doesn't, you get to take another step. And what I learned from that is that
[00:05:49] in Afghanistan, every single day, and I racked to every single day, there are times, count this
[00:05:58] times where somebody has to step forward and do the dangerous thing, do the difficult thing for the
[00:06:04] good of everybody else. And life is no different. And, you know, politics is no different. Somebody has
[00:06:11] to step forward and take that risk and turn to the arena if we want to see meaningful change. So,
[00:06:17] you know, in with respect to what you said, I'm just trying to continue my service in that way
[00:06:25] and have the best impact I can. Yeah, well, that's definitely a different kind of mine field,
[00:06:30] but it's a mine field indeed, you're stepping into. And I think one of the things in you and I
[00:06:34] were talking about this earlier, when I talk to people and I talk to, I do pretty good in talking
[00:06:41] to people from all different kind of political viewpoints. But one thing that I've seen, and I think
[00:06:48] this has a lot to do with kind of where we've gotten this completely divisive culture in politics,
[00:06:56] is that people lack humility, like the normal person that years ago, what I said, oh, well,
[00:07:04] let me hear you out. Now that person, a normal person, you can talk to them and they, they're
[00:07:12] they lack humility to say, you know what, maybe this person has a viewpoint that makes some kind
[00:07:17] of sense, maybe there's some portion. Instead of thinking, you know what, I am 100% right.
[00:07:24] My political viewpoint is 100% right, which means that your political viewpoint is 100% 100%
[00:07:32] 100% wrong. There's no value in anything that you're going to say, you're 100% wrong,
[00:07:37] and I'm 100% right. And that's the line is drawn. It's not even like the, oh, of the line gets drawn.
[00:07:43] The line is drawn that, and it starts with, hey, I'm 19 years old or 26 years old or 38 years old,
[00:07:54] and I, everything that I believe is 100% right. And that means everyone else is 100% wrong.
[00:07:58] Unless you agree with me, if you agree with me, 100% you're okay. By the way, you've seen it on both sides,
[00:08:06] somebody, if somebody makes a step outside of the traditional views of the left or the
[00:08:12] traditional views of the right, these are people that are on the left or are on the right,
[00:08:16] they get shredded by their own side, because everyone's attitude is, I am 100% right. You don't know anything.
[00:08:24] Yeah, I mean, and we have to remember, we have to be aware of what the humility piece is that nobody
[00:08:31] actually knows for sure. Nobody does. We have evidence, we have theories, but we don't know what's
[00:08:39] going to happen when we pass, you know, some legislation, and you can see that over the course of the
[00:08:44] entirety of our country's history, we pass the level, like, oh, this is, this is what it's going to do.
[00:08:48] It's going to do this, this, this, this, this, this, pass the bill, and then that that and that happens.
[00:08:53] You know, like, oh, unintended consequences, there's no way to predict it. So we have to go in there with the
[00:08:58] best knowledge that we can and all the preparation that we can, but, you know, keep in mind that we don't
[00:09:05] actually know everything. And we also have to remember that that person that disagrees with you,
[00:09:12] they just, they're just coming from a different perspective from you. You know, they, you have to,
[00:09:17] what it really boils down to is you both want the same thing. I think, usually, if you disagree with
[00:09:22] somebody, you both want, you know, the American people to have the best lives they can and have the
[00:09:26] most meaningful lives they can, you just want to go about it in a different way. And so, as long as you
[00:09:33] can maintain that attitude, like, this person really, they want the best for these people.
[00:09:42] And then that's how you can kind of disagree with them in a civil manner.
[00:09:45] Mm-hmm. What was the, who put the idea in your head? How did that, that, that, that,
[00:09:52] did someone plant the seed? Did you sit in a watching TV, watching somebody speak? And you were like,
[00:09:56] no, I got to get in this game. Yeah, you know, it was just, uh, yeah, popped into my head like a lot of
[00:10:02] these other crazy ideas that I have, you know, you just out one time and, you know, a lot of it has to
[00:10:08] do with, I thought of the idea initially when I was training for the month of marathon's.
[00:10:12] So, you know, kind of always trying to think ahead of, you know, what's the next thing going to be,
[00:10:16] what's the next thing going to be? And I didn't do the month of marathon's to prepare me for, for this.
[00:10:22] It was this kind of an idea that I had, like, maybe after the month of marathon's is done,
[00:10:26] maybe I'll, you know, take the next step and try and do a little bit more, and I'll try and run
[00:10:30] for Congress. And so, you know, I thought of the idea then, and then I kind of, you know, I was doing
[00:10:36] other things. I ran the month of marathon's came back, still didn't really know what to do or whether
[00:10:41] or not it was possible. And then after the 2018 election, I texted a buddy that I had from,
[00:10:48] from the hospital named Brian Mass, who's a double above knee amputee, and I just, he ran in Florida
[00:10:53] for reelection, he won. So, what a sensible, a tech saying, congratulations on winning. And he said,
[00:10:59] send me something back saying, I loved to have you up here. Let's talk. And I was like, you know,
[00:11:04] what, I actually am, I have been thinking about going that route. He brought me into his office and kind of
[00:11:09] gave me a rundown of, you know, what it takes and what you got to do and he set me up with his consultants
[00:11:15] and they talked to me a little bit and like, you know what, maybe I, I think I can't do this. So,
[00:11:19] he kind of gave me the belief that it was going to be possible. That's awesome. All right,
[00:11:24] let me do this. Let me dig into this a little bit because from the outside,
[00:11:30] what it looks like when we see people entering the political arena, it's like, all of a sudden,
[00:11:34] they just kind of magically appear. Right. What actually happens, you know, when you talk to your friend,
[00:11:39] when you talk to these consultants and people start looking at you as a potential candidate,
[00:11:44] what does all that look like behind the scenes behind the, what do they call the sausage maker?
[00:11:49] Right. Right. Use eat the sausage, but you don't know what's going on behind the scenes. What's
[00:11:52] going on behind the scenes there? Yeah. So, I think the way that I'm kind of in a unique position where
[00:11:58] I'm friends with Brian and he already had some folks that, you know, consult on his campaign
[00:12:03] that were close friends of his and they had experience, you know, they worked on previous campaigns,
[00:12:08] they had a lot of experience, they got him elected, but I think the vast majority of the time you,
[00:12:13] you know, you approach a consultant, it's a position, you do campaign consulting, that's your business.
[00:12:20] So, that's how it's going to make their money. They make their money through campaign consulting.
[00:12:24] Yeah. So, it's a business and there's consultants all over the place for everything you want to do
[00:12:30] in the campaign world getting elected. So, you know, in some cases, it might just be the consultant,
[00:12:38] you know, they just want to paycheck. They think they can, you know, get a paycheck that they can
[00:12:42] try and help you, but in a lot of the cases in the case here is I think they look at,
[00:12:48] you know, whether or not you have a good story, whether or not you, they think you can get elected
[00:12:53] and they kind of believe in you as well. And so, I think when they saw me and I kind of told them
[00:12:58] about myself, they said, okay, here's a good story that we think can get traction and then they
[00:13:04] guys just, you know, it just seems like he's going to be a selfless individual and he'd be a good
[00:13:08] in Congress. And so, those two kind of things combined, I think, in this particular case, but, you know,
[00:13:14] that being said, there's a dichotomy, of course, on Jocco podcast.
[00:13:19] And where there might be, you know, some people that, they're just in it for the paycheck, too.
[00:13:24] This is the consultants are just in it for the paycheck. Sometimes, not all, I mean, I think.
[00:13:28] Where they can be. Yeah, I think the vast majority of the time, you know, they, they want to
[00:13:33] get behind somebody they believe in. What kind of process did they put you through for
[00:13:39] vetting you? I mean, like you said, okay, the interview, they have a good story. Your story is
[00:13:44] kind of public, so it's not really hard to figure out. Yeah. Did they get you, all right, we're going to
[00:13:48] do a Q&A with you. We're going to hammer you with question, did you all that kind of thing?
[00:13:51] Geek simulator? Yeah, a little bit. I, well, I met with Brian and then, you know, so I've just
[00:13:59] he vows for me. So, these two guys that are his friends and ran this campaigns, they, I don't
[00:14:04] think they really need to divet me too much more after that after Brian vows for me. But we did
[00:14:08] meet up and we talked a little bit. And I didn't even, honestly, I didn't even know if they were
[00:14:13] going to help me or not. I thought they were just kind of answering a few questions that I had,
[00:14:17] but then after that they, they said, yeah, we want to, we want to help you run your campaign.
[00:14:23] And so, yeah, I think it's just getting a feel, it's getting to know somebody, getting a, it's like,
[00:14:26] you know, hiring somebody for a job, you get to know who they are and they just decide if they
[00:14:31] want to work with you or not. And, you know, I'm lucky enough that they decide they did.
[00:14:35] And so then, so then what happens next? Yeah, so what happened? A big plan preparation, I mean,
[00:14:40] imagine they want the announcement to be a big deal, right? Yeah. So, so how did all that go down?
[00:14:46] Yeah, so I think I decided, you know, I committed to it and we started setting things in motion,
[00:14:54] you know, probably in April or something like that earlier in the year. And they said, okay,
[00:14:58] so we're going to do an announcement. And so that's kind of a good way to get press and get
[00:15:02] you name out there. It's all about just getting people knowing who you are and knowing your story
[00:15:07] so that they can decide whether or not they think that you're a person that they can support.
[00:15:11] So part of that is making this big announcement because you get a lot of press coverage when you
[00:15:14] announce officially. So we kind of plan this out. You make a video and you prepare press and you
[00:15:23] do a little bit of practice with, you know, answering some of the questions you're going to get on
[00:15:27] announcement day. But mostly it's just about getting kind of the sausage-making stuff in place too.
[00:15:33] You got to find, you have to, there's all sorts of rules about, you know, but the FEC, the
[00:15:41] Federal Election Committee or Commission or whatever. Yeah, some really crazy rules. All sorts of rules.
[00:15:47] So next thing you do is you kind of you hire a compliance, you guys. I was going to say a
[00:15:53] lead team. Like somebody that knows how these things work and then you kind of prepare the paper
[00:15:58] work to file and then you get all these, you kind of get your apparatus in place. So once you announce
[00:16:03] boom, it's like an assault. So some of those rules that you have to be compliant with, like you can
[00:16:10] only take a certain amount of donations, right? I mean, with this and with, after come from certain places.
[00:16:14] Yeah. So individuals can only donate $2,800 per election. And then if there's a primary and a
[00:16:24] general election. So that's $5,600 per election cycle. But if a person donates $5,600 now,
[00:16:31] I can only use $2,800 for the primary and then the other $2,800, I can use in the general
[00:16:37] election. There's all sorts of rules. And then you can't take money from corporations unless there's,
[00:16:44] you can take money from a pack, a political action committee. They can only donate $10,000. And then
[00:16:50] there's things called superpacks that are kind of their own entity. You can't talk with them. They
[00:16:56] can support you, but you can't talk directly with them. So you can't like plan things out with them.
[00:17:02] But they can kind of pick up on what you're doing in your commercials and your advertisements
[00:17:06] and they can kind of into it what they should do to help your campaign. But you can't work directly
[00:17:10] with them. So yeah, there's also, and then usually what you'll do is you'll fly me out and you'll pay
[00:17:17] for a really, really nice hotel. So you're talking about when you're talking about you, you're saying
[00:17:21] Jocco podcast. Jocco on the fort. It's like, hey, yeah, we, we fly you out here and pay for your hotel.
[00:17:28] It's really real nice. Yeah, get you dinner or whatever. But since I'm coming and I'm talking about
[00:17:34] being a political candidate, if I want, if you, if I want to do to pay for the, for my travel out here,
[00:17:40] then you have to do like some kind of in kind donation paperwork and all sorts of stuff. So,
[00:17:45] yeah, there's this all of these different rules. So you kind of have to have somebody that you can
[00:17:50] send an email to really quick. Can we, can we do this? And they say, you probably shouldn't,
[00:17:55] or they, and they handle the, the filing of the paperwork and they do all that. And they handle
[00:17:59] all my donations that come in. So there's so many rules that donations. So all the donations,
[00:18:05] if it's a check, they go down to this guy where he is, he reviews it, make sure you have all the
[00:18:11] stuff like over $200 people have to report their employment information and that kind of thing.
[00:18:16] And then so he makes sure you have all the stuff and it's okay. This is a valid donation.
[00:18:20] We donate that. And if one comes in without the right stuff, and he's like, this is invalid.
[00:18:24] And you can't have it. How big is the staff that you have? I mean, this sounds like,
[00:18:30] I mean, a decent sized operation. Yeah. I mean, it's, and right now it's kind of a skeleton crew
[00:18:37] for the most part. I have my consultants who have been with me, you know, since a before I even announced,
[00:18:43] we have the compliance guy. We have digital consultants that kind of do websites and
[00:18:49] they kind of handle some of the digital fundraising stuff. And then I have an individual
[00:18:54] person fundraiser. So this somebody that knows has a lot of personal connections as experience
[00:19:01] raising money, you know, for political campaigns and other stuff. So I have her. And then she kind
[00:19:07] of helps me raise with the raising money. And then I also have the compliance guy. And then eventually
[00:19:15] you kind of bring on more and more people like a campaign manager and as time goes on. But yes,
[00:19:20] so you kind of right now we have a skeleton crew and then we're just going to keep building and building.
[00:19:23] And, and they're obviously raising money is is, unfortunately.
[00:19:30] That's basically how you get elected. I mean, it's, it's got to be a giant percentage of
[00:19:38] the mechanism that gets elected. So if you don't get, if you don't raise enough money,
[00:19:41] you don't even get the platform to say what, for people to hear what it is that you're going
[00:19:45] to do, what you're going to say, what your beliefs are. So you kind of have to get this
[00:19:50] money raising machine moving. Yeah. So it's more, it's more, more for some people less for other
[00:19:58] people important. So the better story you have, the less money you're going to need to get your
[00:20:07] story out there. And you know, I kind of have an advantage where people have kind of heard of me,
[00:20:12] you know, people aren't coming up to me every day and you know, asking who I am or anything. But
[00:20:17] when somebody hears the guy that ran through a marathon, I was like, oh yeah, I know that guy.
[00:20:22] And then so I can kind of put the face to that, to that name. But yeah, so the, the big part of it is
[00:20:30] people knowing that you're running, knowing you exist, knowing enough about you to decide whether
[00:20:36] or not they want to vote for you. And so you have to look at how we'll help you, how do people
[00:20:41] get their information? They get it through watching TV, they get it through doing through
[00:20:45] the paper, they're going online, podcasts, you know, things of that nature, Facebook ads,
[00:20:51] things like that. And so all those things cost money. So if you want, you're not going to go up to,
[00:20:57] you know, my district has 800,000 people in it. And if I went to every single house for 10 minutes,
[00:21:04] that's what, 8 million minutes. There's just not that many minutes. And so, you know, you should
[00:21:10] run your 31 minutes. Yeah, 31 minutes. Yeah, it's around in circles right now. I know, I would. But yeah,
[00:21:16] so as I, how do people get their information? And that's, that's the way they do it. All those things
[00:21:20] they cost money. And in the DC area, especially, they cost a lot of money. And then, in order to get
[00:21:27] your face and name out there at the most optimum time, the most efficient time, cost even more money.
[00:21:33] If you want to have your ad on, you know, during Fox News or whatever in the morning, that cost a lot more
[00:21:39] money. So yeah, so unfortunately, it's one of those things that you have to raise the money in order
[00:21:45] to just to get your name out there, so people know you exist. So what is the, what is the process
[00:21:50] from here on out? What does it look like? I mean, take me all the way, well, as to the best of your
[00:21:55] knowledge, what happens next? So your, your obviously you spend the next however many months,
[00:22:00] raising money to get this thing going forward. What does it rest of this time look like? Yeah, so
[00:22:04] you want to make milestones along the way, bring you to Election Day victory. Oh, yeah, the money
[00:22:11] raising now. So kind of your first quarter that you raise is kind of a bit of an indicator, like
[00:22:17] if you raise enough money in the first quarter, that's a lot of people kind of use that as a gauge
[00:22:22] on how much of a chance you have. And so that's kind of something. So you want to get, you want to
[00:22:28] have a good raise in your first quarter. When did your first quarter start? July 1st. So it's good
[00:22:33] kind of goes on the fiscal quarters. Okay. So July 1st is September 30th. So we're kind of coming
[00:22:37] up to it. And then I'm kind of at a little bit of a disadvantage because we did our announcement
[00:22:41] on the same be that I got Wundo, which was July 22nd, kind of to make the announcement a little
[00:22:46] bit more special. Right. And so we kind of, so you gave up. Give up three weeks. Yeah. And so,
[00:22:51] yeah, so that's one milestone. And then while you're doing that, you're raising money,
[00:22:56] raise your money and then it's going to first quarter right now. It's going to be, it's been a
[00:23:02] little bit difficult because there's a lot of different factors. It's summertime. So people are,
[00:23:08] you know, on vacation. There's also a local election in Virginia coming up. So a lot of people are kind
[00:23:15] of more focused on that than are really focusing on next year yet, understandably so. And then at
[00:23:20] the same time, I don't, I'm my politician. You know, I have no political apparatus before this.
[00:23:26] And a lot of people that run for office at this level, you know, they've ran for county seat.
[00:23:31] Then they run for state seat. And they run another state seat. So they have, you know, people that
[00:23:36] have donated to them consistently over the years. So they can kind of go back to these people
[00:23:41] over and over again every time they have an election. So they have those people that have already
[00:23:46] donated, so they can raise money kind of quit. I don't have that. So I kind of have to build that
[00:23:50] donor base from scratch. The other thing that I must imagine is a little bit weird is like
[00:23:55] learning how to ask for money. I mean, I know I feel weird to ask anyone for help at anything.
[00:24:04] Right? The guy would rather just do something myself than have to say, hey, could I help?
[00:24:08] Maybe that's an ego thing a little bit of, hey, I don't need anyone to help. Maybe it's an ego
[00:24:12] thing of, I don't want to give that person the little one up on me. You know, I don't want to,
[00:24:18] that's, but also, you know, it's just like being self-sufficient, right? And not wanting to ask
[00:24:23] for a handout. I mean, even when we started this podcast, there was the whole, the whole,
[00:24:30] what is it? Like donation thing was out there, right? It was out there. It was kind of a thing.
[00:24:35] And there was a lot of people that that's how they were running their podcast was by just taking
[00:24:40] donations. And we, we actually still have like a little thing where you can, you can don't want to
[00:24:46] have something on the website where you can donate through PayPal or something like that. Then we've
[00:24:50] had a couple people that have done that, but we probably talked about it twice or whatever,
[00:24:56] like barely ever. Because to me, it feels kind of weird to say, hey, hey, can you give me some money,
[00:25:05] right? And honestly, when we first started trying to, when we were first talking about
[00:25:11] how we would get money to buy what we're doing, to support what we're doing,
[00:25:15] I said, you know, well, maybe we just make some t-shirts, you know, and you're like, yeah,
[00:25:20] we can make t-shirts all day. Cool. Because that way, where, you know, we're not just saying,
[00:25:25] give me something, right? We're saying, hey, you buy this thing and it helps support.
[00:25:31] So you got, you had to overcome the, the idea of I'm going to ask people for money.
[00:25:39] Yeah. It's extremely, it's very, very, very much. And yeah, so what you do first is you go to friends
[00:25:47] and family and you say, look, I'm thinking about that's another one of the rules. You can't say
[00:25:53] before you went out, you can't say you're actually running, you can only say I'm strongly considering
[00:25:58] running for Congress. Would you donate, if I do decide to do this, even if you've already,
[00:26:04] you know, decided that you're going to, you can't actually say it because then you technically,
[00:26:08] you have to file. So all you can say is I'm, you see, so you go to your mom, your dad,
[00:26:12] your close friends and family, I'm strongly considering running for Congress. I'm laughing because
[00:26:17] in my family, those are the last people you'd be asking for money. I don't ask, but, you know,
[00:26:22] that's not happening. We're getting zero from friends. My first two calls were my dad and then my
[00:26:26] mom. Yeah, that's so they were, they were supportive. And then you just kind of slow the call
[00:26:31] through your friends and family, like every phone, every phone number you have in your phone,
[00:26:35] you know, like, so I started with kind of people that I talked to regularly. You know,
[00:26:40] I'll believe what you donate and they say yes. And then you kind of just go through.
[00:26:44] And that's kind of weird, too, because now you're like asking the question, but not even close
[00:26:49] the next one. And you're going to go back to the best. You have to go back to the purpose of saying that.
[00:26:52] What's the purpose? Just to, do you go back to your consultants and say, hey, listen, I'm getting up,
[00:26:56] I'm getting a 50% feedback that people will donate. Yeah, well, the thing about asking people for donations is,
[00:27:02] I had a good buddy, a good name, Frank, that I called him. I texted him or called him or whatever before
[00:27:08] I had, and I said, I'm going to think about running for Congress, will you donate? He's like, oh, yeah,
[00:27:12] definitely. I will definitely donate. And then I'm saying, okay, well, we're trying to donate.
[00:27:16] I get everybody to donate on Monday. We want everybody to donate on Monday because we want to raise
[00:27:20] a bunch of money like on day one. So that's kind of a thing in the political sphere. You'll see,
[00:27:25] like I think recently, a couple of the Democratic presidential candidates, they announced and they said,
[00:27:30] oh, we raised hundreds of thousands of dollars on day one. And they think that's really cool.
[00:27:35] And it's kind of a big deal. And so I say, trying to get everybody to donate on Monday, July 22nd,
[00:27:42] you know, if I run or whatever. So then my fund, I gave my fundraiser all the
[00:27:48] text messages that I contacted. She sent them all a text on Monday reminding him, here's the link.
[00:27:54] And then this guy, Frank, he didn't donate. And then so I called him again, you know, a week later,
[00:27:59] like, hey, just wanted to remind you, you know, I've announced now raising money. And he calls me back
[00:28:04] a couple of weeks later and he says, okay, I finally donated. And I said, and he wrote, he, he, uh,
[00:28:10] he was calling me. Yeah, yeah, something. And he runs the rowing program for UVA,
[00:28:17] the men's rowing program. And so he has to get a lot of donations. I said, so all you got any,
[00:28:22] got any tips for me on raising money, you know, how to ask for money. I'm not very good at it.
[00:28:25] And you said, listen, you got to remember, I'm a close friend. And it took me three weeks and three
[00:28:31] reminders to donate to you. So you hit somebody up the first time. And they want to support you, but
[00:28:38] you just hit them, you know, when they're about to get in the car or, you know, they're,
[00:28:43] take drop in the kids off at school or something like that. And they just forget, you know,
[00:28:46] and see, you got to remind them again. And then you see, you kind of have to make sure you hit them
[00:28:50] at the right time where they're okay. I'm just sitting around watching TV or whatever, eating dinner,
[00:28:54] I can do it right now. So you kind of have to just keep following up with people. So you,
[00:29:02] friends of family first, and then once you get through all that, then you start kind of calling,
[00:29:08] people that have donated previously. So you kind of, you can get these lists.
[00:29:12] I'm sitting here trying to think if you, if what you hit me up before, I didn't get you on this
[00:29:17] event. You hit me up. I think you said, hey, I'm going to run or I'm thinking about it for Congress.
[00:29:22] Maybe I could come back on the podcast. And I was like, oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, I think I don't think
[00:29:27] you actually hit me up for the cash though. I didn't hit you up for the cash because
[00:29:32] friendship capital, like on a like a leadership capital. Okay. Yeah, I figure you're kind of
[00:29:36] already helping me out. So you, you've helped me out this so much already with, have me on, you know,
[00:29:41] before the month, the month, the month, the month, the month and all that stuff. And now you're going
[00:29:44] to help me out again with this podcast. And I just kind of figure, you know, I don't want to ask too much of
[00:29:49] you. Well, right on, but you're not going to get anything if you don't ask. Yeah, exactly. I'm saying
[00:29:54] over here. Not to mention that. That's the thing that you remember too. You have to ask even though it's
[00:29:59] uncomfortable. So yeah, then you start. You start a product. Can you sell a t-shirt and use that,
[00:30:09] the profits from that? I don't know. I'm not sure. I'd have to ask. What about personal money?
[00:30:15] Like, you always get about the rich politicians, they just spend a lot of money. You can sell fun as much as you want.
[00:30:19] So you can donate to your campaign as much as you want. But if you're doing, I don't, you know,
[00:30:24] I don't have enough money anyway. So it wouldn't really be a drop in the bucket for me to sell
[00:30:28] all the cars. So in carrots, yeah, for me. It's not enough carrots to pay for this.
[00:30:35] We did just start getting eggs. So maybe that'll be, you know, something that we can add to it. But
[00:30:41] yes, why simply just don't have enough money. But yeah, there's some people that take
[00:30:44] mortgages out on their homes. And they kind of loan the campaign $200, $300,000. And then
[00:30:54] they get paid back after they really start raising money. I can't do that either because I don't
[00:30:58] have a mortgage on my home because it was given to me by a new veteran charity. So there's no mortgage.
[00:31:03] And I can't take out a mortgage for five years as a part of our contract. But yeah, so
[00:31:09] yes, the people close to you, they donate. And then you start kind of going through these lists of
[00:31:14] people that have donated to campaigns before. They're politically active. A lot of the times they
[00:31:20] have a little bit more cash to spare. You start calling them. But that's unpleasant too because a
[00:31:24] lot of the times it's just cold calls. And you go, you know, you have to listen to it. This is,
[00:31:29] yeah, this is me. So my fundraiser, she just basically just sends me call sheets. So she gets
[00:31:35] these lists of, it's all publicly available if they donate averse certain amount. So this goes online.
[00:31:40] They, they donate to this other Republican candidate for this other Democratic candidate. So they
[00:31:45] might like you. So you just kind of, and there's a bunch of phone numbers on there. And a lot of the
[00:31:50] times it doesn't work. Or it's like a main number to their business. And you kind of have to go in and
[00:31:56] go into the directory and call it. And you call them up and you just go, you know, you do your little
[00:32:01] 22nd spiel. How many of these phone calls have you made? Oh, and it's like my schedule is 9 to 11
[00:32:10] campaign fundraising phone calls work out at 11, eat lunch at 12, 1 to 3, make phone calls. What are you
[00:32:18] doing from 430 in the morning until 9? 430 in more until 9. Usually 430 to 630,
[00:32:24] cutting old saw and logs. And then 7 is usually when I start, I'll start reading.
[00:32:31] Or I'll start doing some writing, kind of flushing out my thoughts on things. And then between
[00:32:36] 7 and 9. Because you can't call people for 9 to clock at that. So 9 to 11 you're making phone calls.
[00:32:42] And then you said from 1 to 3 you're also making phone calls. Yeah, if I have a hammering through a list.
[00:32:46] Yeah. So my fundraiser will sell me 20, 25 at a time. And these lists and you just kind of look at it.
[00:32:52] This is what's the contact rate? Very low. If you make 100 calls, how many people do you talk to?
[00:32:58] I'd say maybe 10 like directly when I call 10% of the chance of you have of me picking up a
[00:33:08] phone phone number. I don't recognize is zero. Yeah, exactly. It's zero. And a lot of
[00:33:12] it's not what you do is you call and the vast majority of the time you're calling their place to work.
[00:33:16] And so they have an assistant. And so you have to kind of... You have to kind of craft a little script almost.
[00:33:27] That gets them to... That kind of intrigues them. And it has to be short because you can't be too long.
[00:33:33] Oh, when I first started out I was doing this for 30 seconds. Okay. Let's hear it. All right. So ring ring ring.
[00:33:40] I'll call Echo. Ring ring ring ring. Hello. Oh, hi. This is Rob Jones. I'm calling for Mr. Charles. Yes,
[00:33:47] is it? Oh, hi, Mr. Charles. My name is Rob Jones. I'm a wooden ring from Middleberg, Virginia.
[00:33:52] And I'm calling today because I'm running for Congress in Virginia's 10th District. And
[00:33:55] this is how many you might have a few minutes to speak with me about my campaign to see if you
[00:34:00] might be willing to support me. Yeah. And that's what I said. Yeah. Pretty straightforward. Yeah. So
[00:34:06] I kind of... And it's been kind of... And your fundraiser, they're kind of good at that. So they
[00:34:12] kind of advise you on what to say. And so I kind of when I first started out I kind of had like this
[00:34:17] minute long monologue. They're like, hello. Hi, I'm Rob Jones. And I ran 31 marathon 31 days.
[00:34:22] And I did all this stuff. And then I'd buy the end of it. You know, they haven't spoken like a minute and a half.
[00:34:27] You know, so you got to bring that down. We're not with life. And I wrote extreme ownership.
[00:34:32] Then we did our first event that the book was at. And it's a big event. Or it's like maybe
[00:34:38] 1,000 to 1,500 people there. And we got done. We got offstage. And they had a bunch of books for us to
[00:34:45] sell. And people were going to buy. And then they could we could sign them. And as soon as we got off
[00:34:50] stage, it was like, mayhem. Everyone was really fired up. And here's this brand new book. And
[00:34:57] the big message you just come from us. And so the end they got the two little tables for us to sign on.
[00:35:03] There's a stack of books for us to to give to the people. And the very first person. And you know,
[00:35:11] let life like the joke is that life is like a nice person. And I'm not. And so the first
[00:35:19] immediately as I looked at the line, this was, you know, one of the, this is like one of the
[00:35:23] few things that I'm naturally gifted at. Like looking at a scenario and kind of figure not really
[00:35:28] quick what needs to happen to get this done. So I see people lined up. And I say to myself,
[00:35:35] all right, I need to be signing these books as fast as humanly possible. So I immediately start signing
[00:35:40] the extreme ownership book, just own it, Jocco. That's that's all I'm right. Yeah. So I get like
[00:35:46] two, three people. Hey, I don't like to meet a gym gym, own it, Jocco, boom, hand it to life, boom.
[00:35:50] Next person, I get through five or six people. And all of a sudden, there's all, there's a,
[00:35:56] there's a, there's a, there's a roadblock right next to me. His name is Lave Babin. And he's such a nice guy
[00:36:04] that, you know, he says, hey, Jim, how you doing? Where about you from? And you know, the person's like,
[00:36:09] I'm from wherever I'm from Maryland. Ah, you know, I went to Naval Academy up there,
[00:36:15] that was man, what a beautiful thing. So what, you know, what would you do for living? And he's
[00:36:18] having legit conversation. And then he's right, you know, Jim, so good to talk with another person
[00:36:24] that, you know, grew up in the fine state of Maryland and I appreciate the support that you all
[00:36:28] gave us when I was up there going to Naval Academy. And I hope that everything goes well with your
[00:36:31] business. Appreciate it. Lead and win. And man, it took him, it was like, it took him, by the time
[00:36:42] he, I had handed him the, the, you know, 17th book and he wasn't done with his first one. He just,
[00:36:48] he started writing lead wins and they're not. But yeah, you know, it's like the, the, the, the ability to
[00:36:56] really be nice in a situation like that is a little bit tougher. And also, you know, people,
[00:37:02] but you don't want to waste people's time. You know what I mean? You know, you got to get to the point,
[00:37:05] like you said, you got to get, you got to get at least the initial message of, hey, this is who I am.
[00:37:10] And this is what I'm doing. And do you want to talk about that a little bit? Yeah. And I got,
[00:37:14] it's a strange balance because I want to, I want to keep it short, but also say something that
[00:37:20] makes them give me the benefit of the doubt. Yeah. So it's kind of figuring out what that is. And I decided
[00:37:26] saying I'm a wounded Marine running for Congress. That was kind of a good balance of that. Well,
[00:37:30] that's a big statement, right? That's it. You're in the Marine Corps. You obviously have served.
[00:37:36] You have made sacrifices for your country already. And now you're willing to serve more. That's a
[00:37:41] pretty big. That's a, that's a short statement, but it's also, it cares. There's a lot of meeting
[00:37:46] behind it. There's a lot of weight behind it. Yeah. Okay. So I'm still sitting here thinking myself
[00:37:51] from a efficiency perspective. You don't have some other three people that are dialing through
[00:37:56] and being like, okay, Rob, we got to live one boom and hand in you the phone. Not really. I mean,
[00:38:01] sometimes my, my fundraisers will have relationships with some people. And she'll say, I've already
[00:38:07] talked to this guy. Just, you just got to call him and talk to him for a couple of minutes and
[00:38:11] he's probably going to donate. But yeah, I guess, you know, the way that it works is people probably
[00:38:17] aren't going to talk to you if you don't call him directly. Yeah. I'm going to tell you what, don't
[00:38:21] ever, I'll donate to your campaign. Don't give my number to any of those lists. I don't want anyone
[00:38:26] else calling me. Well, the best thing about how much you donate. Yeah, depending on how much you donate,
[00:38:31] you just put victories, phone numbers or put, yeah, you've got to put a phone number at some point. And
[00:38:37] I'm going to try and tell this, um, do without, without dropping any dimes on anyone or anything. But
[00:38:44] anyways, there was a, an organization and it's not really a charity organization. But somehow,
[00:38:51] I had donated money to this organization a long time ago. And so they would call me consistently
[00:38:58] all the time. And when they would call my house, I would put them on speaker phones. So my whole
[00:39:02] family could be entertained by what I would say. But anyways, they called one time and they say,
[00:39:09] oh, this is, we're looking for Mr. Willink. I said, yeah, this is, now this is,
[00:39:13] blah, blah, blah, blah, and we're, you know, it's fundraising time again and we're, we're looking to
[00:39:19] up the numbers this year. And this is one of my got a phone speaker phone. And I don't, I forget the
[00:39:25] years it was, but the, the girl says, and I'm looking at your, our records right now and it looks like
[00:39:29] the last time you donate was eight years ago, you donated $10. And I was like, yeah, I said,
[00:39:39] why don't you call me in another eight years and we'll re-op that figure. So I like that. So yeah,
[00:39:44] don't get my name. Don't mind number on that. I wouldn't, I would never give out anybody's phone
[00:39:49] number, but if they don't, if they donate and they report it, then there's a number here and that's
[00:39:54] how you get it. But yeah, so that's, that's kind of where people are coming from with, they get
[00:40:00] donation calls all the time. And I'm just another guy. So you have to figure out how to make yourself
[00:40:06] unique and get through that kind of guardedness in the very beginning that, you know, they're,
[00:40:12] they're automatically probably going to say, no, you know, I get, this is the 50th call I've gotten.
[00:40:17] Right. And I'm busy. I'm calling them and work. And these people, a lot of the times, you know,
[00:40:20] they're a little bit wealthier. So it's not like they just got all their wealth by sitting around,
[00:40:25] watching Netflix, you know, they are working. They're working hard. So yeah, you kind of have to figure
[00:40:32] out away. And a lot of the times it'll be, I'll talk to an assistant and then she'll say, well,
[00:40:37] no, they're not available or they're not here because they're working. I don't leave a message
[00:40:42] to throw or I'll leave a voicemail on their phone. And then I give it a week. If I have an email
[00:40:46] address for them, I'll send them a follow-up email and you can be a little bit more of a boast and an
[00:40:49] email. So I kind of like that where I can kind of mention the 31 marathons and be a little bit
[00:40:54] more of a boast there. Send them a follow-up email if they don't reply to that, then I'll call them
[00:40:59] again. And you just kind of have to, you have a spreadsheet of people you call and you're like,
[00:41:03] call them, okay, I call this person 10 days ago. So today's another good idea.
[00:41:06] And what's weird to me is you could call a billionaire who goes, oh, I absolutely want to support you.
[00:41:11] I got your back 100% I was in the Marine Corps. I was wounded as well in Korea or in Vietnam.
[00:41:18] And you got my support and all you can get from his 20 hundred bucks. Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:24] But yeah, and some other elections like in state elections, if a billionaire likes you,
[00:41:28] you can give you a billion dollars if you want, but federal elections can't do that.
[00:41:34] So yeah, that's, and it's stuff. So you got a call and call and call and call and call and then you
[00:41:38] got to do stuff to get your name out there. And at some point will it beat Will someone else start
[00:41:44] making calls for you? Not really. I mean, so Brian who just continues to help it help me a lot of
[00:41:53] different ways, he'll make calls like he has, he has donors that he goes doing. So lately he's been
[00:41:59] making a few calls to their donors, to his donors and saying, you know, let me tell you about this guy
[00:42:03] Rob Jones, where you consider talking to him. And they say, yes, you're having call me. So then I call them.
[00:42:07] So in a way, yeah. And then if, yeah, I mean, if somebody knows somebody that they think would be
[00:42:13] interested in speaking to me and doing to my campaign, they'll call them. But a lot of these people,
[00:42:19] nobody knows. And so, and a lot of the times my fundraiser should set me up with people that are
[00:42:24] more likely to see things that are more likely to do. And I like I've called several Marines,
[00:42:30] you know, or other veterans. And yeah. And so they have that connection with me immediately because
[00:42:37] we're both veterans. So they're more willing to talk to me. It seems to me like it would be a good
[00:42:41] idea to get someone else to call for two reasons. Number one, efficiency of your time. But number two,
[00:42:51] it's kind of like it's easier for someone else to brag about you than it is for you to brag about
[00:42:57] yourself. Yeah. Yeah. For someone to call up and say, hey, how you doing? My name is Jocca Willink.
[00:43:01] And I'm actually not calling for myself. I'm calling for a great friend of mine that is a former
[00:43:07] Marine. He was wounded in Afghanistan. And he's actually not done serving yet. He's running for
[00:43:13] Congress here in the great state of Virginia. And I was wondering if you could maybe help out or
[00:43:19] are interested in supporting what he's doing. Like it seems like that would be kind of a good way to do it.
[00:43:26] Yeah. No, I agree with you. And you have to have, you know, outside the box ideas like that.
[00:43:32] Because the instinct is, well, because my first instinct is, oh, that's awesome that you're doing
[00:43:36] it yourself. Like that really shows like if you personally called me, I'd be more apt. But then I thought
[00:43:42] about it well, maybe, but someone else called me and saying, hey, this guy's running. He's a great guy.
[00:43:48] It's sort of a, it seems like that would be helpful as well. I'm not sure if you can't pay manager. So
[00:43:54] the consultants, hey, back off everyone, you get no mad at me right now. No, I don't tell Rob not to do that.
[00:44:00] Yeah. No, I think the main difference is probably that the fundraiser kind of knows that these people
[00:44:09] might not go for that kind of thing. But what you're talking about, I think would work great
[00:44:13] on kind of the more of a grassroots level where you're trying to call a lot of people and get
[00:44:17] smaller donations. And that's kind of important too. You want to get all those donations as well.
[00:44:22] Oh, so right now you're going after the big hitters kind of. Yeah. You're kind of go like these
[00:44:26] calls. There are people that have donated, you know, a thousand dollars in the past five thousand.
[00:44:30] And that kind of thing. So those kind of people, usually wouldn't. It's so weird to weigh these
[00:44:35] mechanisms work. Oh yeah. In the world. Like this is, you set up a system and you have no idea.
[00:44:41] Like, you know, you said earlier, you make laws, but you don't actually know what they're
[00:44:45] going to do when they hit the books and when they start getting an act in the world. This is one of
[00:44:50] those things. Like whoever made these laws, probably, or these rules, or when these rules were made,
[00:44:56] people have no idea how it was going to turn out. What it actually, what that actually translates
[00:45:03] to in the real world. Yeah. And one of my favorite examples of that is going through Officer Canada
[00:45:09] School in Officer Canada School. There was things that you did at Officer Canada School that had no,
[00:45:15] there's no possible way that the intention of the drill instructors was to have you doing what
[00:45:22] you're doing. One of the examples is you get a belt buckle. You get a belt buckle that has a
[00:45:29] coating on it. It's like a shiny brass belt buckle, but it's got a coating on this shiny brass
[00:45:34] belt buckle that because, you know, brass turns green or whatever. Yeah. Quick. Well, you get this one
[00:45:38] that's been treated in such a way that it never will get, it just stays shiny all the time. I mean,
[00:45:44] you can get thumb prints on it. If you stick your finger, although your thumb, but you can easily wipe it off.
[00:45:48] Well, what you do is you have to clean these belt buckles with brass so,
[00:45:55] until that lining comes off completely. And then you end up with a thing that you have to constantly
[00:46:01] polish all the time and it doesn't hold its shine. And you think yourself, at some point, someone said,
[00:46:06] hey, make sure there's no fingerprints on your brass belt buckle. And so people started cleaning it,
[00:46:10] and then they started cleaning it until the actual finish was off. And now this thing has become,
[00:46:16] become a totally different game. The game is no longer just keep your belt buckle clean. It's
[00:46:24] go completely psycho with with with brass. So until the thing is, it's not even functionally more.
[00:46:32] When you get done with oxygenated, it's going to throw that thing away because it has no purpose.
[00:46:35] Yeah. They didn't mean it that way. At some point, somewhere along the way, a journalist
[00:46:40] struck her said, hey, you're going to film print. Make sure there's no fingerprints on your belt buckle.
[00:46:44] And that went from that over, however, me 30, 50 years to you polish all the finish completely off that
[00:46:52] thing until it's just pure brass. You get all these weird things that happen like that. And that's what
[00:46:57] this is. You know, it's this environment that's created. And all of a sudden, you've got these
[00:47:02] potential candidates or candidates that are running that are jumping through these random hoops
[00:47:08] that have been built by random laws that were that seem to make sense to somebody at some time.
[00:47:14] Yeah. Well, they're not entirely random, but they have, they have, you know,
[00:47:19] purposes and theories behind them. They want to prevent corruption. They want, they want,
[00:47:24] you know, politicians to be bought off or anything like that. But then you're never going to think
[00:47:30] of absolutely every single contingency that could possibly happen. And then so you have the,
[00:47:35] you know, these are the rules. And then, you know, human beings, these big old brains
[00:47:40] that we can adapt to when people figure out, you know, ways to maneuver and, you know,
[00:47:44] this is what you get. And then so you're like, okay, we can't do this in this. And I will
[00:47:48] they just do a different way. So you can, you know, you, you create a best system you can. And then
[00:47:53] you just have to let people, you know, you, obviously always try and improve upon it. But you
[00:48:01] just have to live within that system. Do you guys do like an analytics to see,
[00:48:07] hey, how much are we getting from the calling center? I just feel like door to door,
[00:48:11] cold calling, like, is just as time goes on. It's like less and less and less of a thing. Yeah.
[00:48:16] Um, well, yeah. So we keep track. So like everybody that I call, I put in a spreadsheet.
[00:48:23] And I talk, you know, I put in there the result of call, what number I call, you know,
[00:48:28] what day I call them. So I can kind of look back. And then, yeah, so we kind of know.
[00:48:34] And so we can kind of analyze that. But kind of as you, as time goes on, a lot of the times
[00:48:42] it'll get easier to raise money because people see that you're raising money in success,
[00:48:46] green success. So they'll check and say, oh, this guy's already raised $200,000 or whatever. Maybe.
[00:48:52] And then, okay, so he's a viable candidate now. So I'm actually going to donate him.
[00:48:55] And another reason that's kind of hard right now is because we have, you know,
[00:48:59] there's going to be a primary and a lot of people don't want to support in a primary because
[00:49:02] these people have money. They want to invest in something that they think is going to,
[00:49:07] you know, be fruitful. So then there's no way to know. And so that's why you kind of have to get your
[00:49:11] story out there. You have to kind of convince them, you know, why you're a viable candidate and why
[00:49:15] they should support you. And it's not the most pleasant thing to have to do. And it's not the easiest
[00:49:21] thing to do. But the more you do it, the more I'm kind of getting used to it now. And I'd rather
[00:49:25] ask a stranger for money than, you know, ask a close friend for money for sure. So then what's
[00:49:32] it? Okay. So we get, we get through this first quarter ends in September. Then what, what's
[00:49:38] what, what does the campaign go from there? Do you have any idea, or are you just kind of like
[00:49:42] on board for the ride? I have no idea of where it's going to go. But yeah, I'm not an expert as my first
[00:49:48] time. So at the same time as you're raising money in these early stages, you are getting, just
[00:49:56] getting out and talking to people, going to events. And it's like I've been going to a
[00:50:02] Republican committee meetings and introducing myself. Like a lot of the times all out candidates
[00:50:06] to come up in the beginning and speak for a few minutes and just so that they know, you know,
[00:50:10] I introduce myself. And then so you kind of building that network of people that know who you are
[00:50:15] and you're creating a little bit of buzz and you're meeting people. And I go out and I talk
[00:50:19] to board a supervisors on counties. And I just kind of taught in mayors and that kind of thing.
[00:50:24] And I just say, I just sit down and then what are the, you know, what are the issues that people
[00:50:28] are talking about here? And Northern Virginia is always traffic. There's like number one.
[00:50:31] And so I just say, what are people talking about tonight? It's kind of getting details on that.
[00:50:36] Because these people kind of know, you know, they know the people on a granular level because
[00:50:41] they're local representatives. So they can kind of tell me. And then you kind of look at that.
[00:50:45] And then you can kind of see, okay, most of the people are talking about this and this and this.
[00:50:50] And so you kind of get a feel for that. And then at the same time as you're doing that, you're doing a lot of
[00:50:54] you know, research on policy. So you got to read up on, you know, all these different
[00:51:01] issues that you're finding out that people care about. You got to figure out, you know,
[00:51:06] what they are, what you can do to change them, what you can do to improve them,
[00:51:09] and that kind of things. So you kind of doing all these things simultaneously.
[00:51:13] And you just kind of go on that trajectory. Raise money, meet people, learn policies.
[00:51:18] When's the primary for you? Uh, so Virginia is kind of unique in that they every year.
[00:51:26] They kind of decide how they're going to select candidates. They're a public
[00:51:30] party. It is how they're going to select their candidates. So they just recently decided that
[00:51:35] they're not going to do a primary. What they're going to do is call a convention. And so they're
[00:51:39] going to have this convention in the 10th district. Uh, sometime next year, they haven't said
[00:51:44] a date for you. I don't probably be spring time spring, maybe early so. Yeah, probably late spring.
[00:51:50] And what they'll do is they'll bring in all these delegates from all over the counties. The
[00:51:58] county is sent a certain number of delegates in. And what they'll do is all the candidates that want to
[00:52:04] try and be the, uh, the Republican candidate. They'll get up and they'll speak in front of the delegation.
[00:52:10] And then the delegates will go vote. And then if they don't have over 50%. If one person doesn't
[00:52:16] have over 50%. They'll knock off the bottom one or the bottom two and they'll vote again.
[00:52:21] And they'll keep doing that. Keep doing that. Keep doing that. And then at the end, they'll
[00:52:24] send white smoke out of the, the top of the building. Uh, no. But they'll have, so
[00:52:31] eventually we'll be one person versus one person, so I'll get the majority. And then that's the
[00:52:35] person. That's it right there. And how many other people are going in the 10th district?
[00:52:39] Against, do you know right now there's one, uh, one other guy, army veteran.
[00:52:45] But there's always rumors. I mean, there's always other people that, you know, come in.
[00:52:48] And so there's rumors about other people that are thinking about coming in. But until they file,
[00:52:53] you don't know. It's just a conjecture. So you know that this just got recently to decide it on the fifth.
[00:53:00] So now that we have that kind of a situation, that's good in bad for us. Um, you know, unlike
[00:53:06] misogy I have no preference. I'll just do whatever the system is. That's what it is.
[00:53:11] Okay, cool. We're going to adapt to that. But uh, it's good for us because it requires less money.
[00:53:20] So you don't have to go out there and do commercials for the primary and that kind of stuff.
[00:53:23] You don't have to do a lot of advertising. You can save all your money for the general election.
[00:53:28] And when you're running against an incumbent, they already have millions and millions and millions
[00:53:31] of dollars. So you're going to be coming from a from a deficit compared to them. So that's good.
[00:53:37] I can kind of save a little bit of money. Uh, but it's also a little bit more difficult because
[00:53:42] now you have to go out and you have to kind of, you have to find out who the delegates are.
[00:53:47] And they make a list of it. But you have to kind of talk to these delegates. And you have to convince
[00:53:52] them why you're the, you know, the best person. If you don't have make a good impression on this one
[00:53:57] person, well, they might not, you know, that's a vote loss. And so there's only so many delegates
[00:54:01] that you can talk to. So yeah, it's kind of pros and cons with it. But that's what we're doing.
[00:54:07] And so that's what I'm adapting to. And that's what we're going to, so we're going to make happen.
[00:54:11] And that's not even, we don't even know when that's going to happen right now.
[00:54:14] It'll be 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20. Yeah. Do you get, will you be making a
[00:54:21] speech at that thing straight up? Yeah, I mean, I think so. That's what I've been told anyway.
[00:54:25] I guess they, they have to come up with all the rules and everything of how it's going to work.
[00:54:31] Well, I guess they have rules in place, but they have to like release them. So you know,
[00:54:35] I'm sure there's, you know, you have to file as a candidate and all this stuff, you know,
[00:54:39] at the convention. But I think what the, what the guy told me that I talk to said is that they're
[00:54:45] going to do it where each person gets up and gives a stump speech before they start voting.
[00:54:49] But a lot of the work is going to be done before ideally you will have all your votes
[00:54:57] before you even ever give that speech. You're going to do the legwork. It's kind of like,
[00:55:01] you know, this is actually something that Pam says. And she's a, you know, four-time
[00:55:04] role champion, due to unparalleled big champion. So I should probably listen to what she says about
[00:55:09] competing. She says the race is one not on the day, but in the months and years that you spent
[00:55:17] training beforehand. So you got to put in the legwork, talk to these delegates, and you can even
[00:55:23] convince friends of yours to go try and be delegates. I see, you kind of, you know, get a team together
[00:55:30] like, yeah, get a team together to go there and try and become delegates. And said,
[00:55:34] they're your friends. So the vote for you. So you have to kind of do that legwork in order to hopefully win
[00:55:41] the vote before you even give your stump speech.
[00:55:43] This is one of the things I was thinking about as, you know, when we start talking about politics
[00:55:51] and in your case in particular, one of the things that comes up all the time in politics is gun control
[00:55:58] and all those issues. One of the things I was thinking about is you're, you went to Virginia Tech
[00:56:05] April 16th, 2007, newest 32 people killed in a mass shooting there. Were you on campus when
[00:56:12] that happened? No, I was a, was in my apartment. Oh, you were. Yeah, I was by Mr. My soon, you
[00:56:18] seen your year. So I was there, ish, but I was in an apartment off campus. I just lived there.
[00:56:23] And when we got the first reports, it was kind of like, they were just saying that somebody
[00:56:30] was roaming around campus, you know, shooting people. So maybe it just, you know, graduated from boot camp
[00:56:37] not too long before. So I like a medial. I would go over there. So I, you know, I walked over to campus
[00:56:43] to see if I, without any kind of protection or anything to see if I could find this guy or whatever,
[00:56:48] walked around a little bit, but you know, I didn't see anybody because, you know, it was all happening
[00:56:52] in the building and it was all over by the time, I even left my apartment.
[00:56:57] And yeah, so I wasn't, you know, I wasn't there there. You know, I wasn't nowhere near the, the shooting,
[00:57:03] but I was there for the, you know, the aftermath and the, you know, just the pain that we felt as a community
[00:57:09] after the fact. What was the, what was the atmosphere afterwards? I mean, what they do with the
[00:57:16] students at school that you guys, what do you do with a, you know, a test you have on on Wednesday,
[00:57:23] what they just like the basic life stuff. Yeah, it is, it's just disbelief, you know, you can't believe
[00:57:28] that it happened at all. And you can't believe that it happened to you, you know, to your community.
[00:57:36] And yeah, it's just one of those, I think they, you know, they, they just have to give you time,
[00:57:44] they give you, they give you, you know, gave everybody the week off. They're at the school. I think
[00:57:48] that a really good job of supporting the students in my opinion, you know, they said no pressure.
[00:57:53] So they actually came out and said, if you want to, you don't have to finish the semester, if you
[00:58:00] don't want to. You can just cut your grades here and your teacher or your professor will, you know,
[00:58:05] have a grade for you based on what you've done to this point. And you don't have to, you don't have to finish
[00:58:10] the year if you don't want to. And so they gave them that option. They had, you know, support available to,
[00:58:16] to anybody that was, you know, was struggling with, with dealing with the situation. They made that
[00:58:21] available, you know, memorials. It's like, there's not a whole lot, you can't deal with the thing
[00:58:26] that everybody wants you to do is go back in time and have somebody tackle that guy, you know,
[00:58:32] before he ever did anything. You know, not to make it about me, but the way I felt about, I felt,
[00:58:39] I felt guilty that I wasn't in the building. You know, that's how I kind of felt about it. Like,
[00:58:43] maybe I could have been in one of those rooms and ran out the guy and, I don't know, given,
[00:58:50] people some time, you know, like a lot of people did. There was one professor that was a Holocaust
[00:58:55] survivor, slammed the door, blocked it. And I think he had his students crawl out the window or something.
[00:59:00] And he gets, you know, he got killed by the, by the shooter. And so that's kind of how I felt at the
[00:59:06] time about it. I wish I had been there to maybe do something. But it's mostly just, you just,
[00:59:13] you know, you just can't believe it. It's kind of indescribable.
[00:59:15] It's an interesting idea of giving, when you first said, oh, they gave people the option of,
[00:59:22] of just taking their grade right there, whatever it happened to be at that time and then you
[00:59:26] don't, I don't have to finish this semester. And at first I thought to myself, yeah, that's a really
[00:59:29] good idea. And then as I thought about it, sitting here as you were talking,
[00:59:34] what that does, what that could do to people is, okay, now what are you going to do? So now what
[00:59:39] do you do? You sit there and you start to dwell on this and that seems to me like a good idea that
[00:59:46] in practice, the best thing to, not the best thing to do. But well, I think it's the best thing to do
[00:59:53] is okay, we're going to, we're going to get a week off, right? Maybe we're going to get two weeks off.
[00:59:58] But we're going to get a week off. We're going to hold ceremonies. We're going to mourn. And then
[01:00:02] we're going to get back to work and we're going to carry on. And because otherwise you're stuck
[01:00:11] with just the thoughts of the loss that you suffered. And it's one of those weird things.
[01:00:20] When you say that you, that you need to move on, right? It sounds like the coldest,
[01:00:27] most horrible thing that a person could say if you, if someone loses a loved one and you look
[01:00:34] at him and you say, well, you know, you've got to move on, right? And that's like, that seems
[01:00:39] like the most horrible and cold thing to say. Yeah. Hey, you've lost the love for them, but guess
[01:00:44] what, you got to move on. That sounds so horrible. But it's kind of what you need to do, right? I mean,
[01:00:53] you, it's what you need to do. Your, your love one that you've lost, they don't want you to sit
[01:00:58] around in mourn for seven months while you wait for the semester to end for summer to end. And then
[01:01:04] you go, what are you going to do during that time period? Yeah. And so that's a rough thing to think about.
[01:01:10] But I think it's, it's definitely one of those hard things that you have, the hard conversation
[01:01:18] that you have to have and sometimes you have to have that conversation with yourself
[01:01:21] is when you say to yourself or you say to someone else, you've got to move on.
[01:01:27] And it seems so cold and heartless, but at the same time, it's what you actually do have to do.
[01:01:36] Yeah. And yeah, I never actually thought about it from that perspective in terms of, you know,
[01:01:40] them allowing people to, to, you know, cut the semester short. But, you know, that's a really
[01:01:45] good point. You have to have something to do. Otherwise, you're just going to sit around and
[01:01:49] just think about it all day, all the time. But at the same time, you know, they didn't want people's
[01:01:54] grades to be affected by, be negatively affected by, you know, for sure. Yeah, for sure.
[01:01:58] For sure. I don't know. It's kind of see where they're coming from for sure.
[01:02:02] Tough decision to make, tough decision to make. Yeah, I don't know.
[01:02:07] You know, another thing that that's that I've definitely thought about since you, you know, entered
[01:02:14] into this arena is thinking about a thing about Lewis Polar Jr. Right? Yeah. Run in for
[01:02:22] running for the House of Representatives in the first district of Virginia. He ran as a Democrat.
[01:02:29] He, as we know, lost the election and he lost it to basically a Republican kind of warhawk. Yeah.
[01:02:39] That had the draft deferment multiple times. So it didn't go to Vietnam, but was kind of, you know,
[01:02:49] a warhawk type guy. Yeah. And one thing that's really interesting when you read
[01:02:57] fortunate son is that there was all these opportunities that Lewis Polar Jr. had to kind of start
[01:03:04] negative campaigning against his opponent and he didn't do it. And he ran that campaign with his
[01:03:12] much dignity and class as you as a as a person could run. Yeah. And any loss, any loss by a
[01:03:19] big big margin, too. I think he lost by like 25% which is crazy to think about.
[01:03:28] Are you thinking about right now? What it looks like where where your own
[01:03:33] personal line of, hey, this is too far and I'm not going to go there. You have to, yeah, you
[01:03:40] have to maintain your more compass and you want, I want to win, but I want to win in the way
[01:03:46] that I set out to win. I don't want to win by being somebody that I'm not. I want to win by being
[01:03:52] the person that I am and then if people want that person to represent them in Congress, then I'd
[01:03:59] be honored to do that. But if the person I am, the people decide that they don't want that in Congress,
[01:04:06] you know, fair enough. I understand no hard feelings. I still love this area. I still love the
[01:04:11] district. This is where you get into a little slippery slope possibility. Yeah. Okay.
[01:04:16] Because here's the question you can ask yourself is listen, I'm Rob Jones. I know I want to do
[01:04:23] the right thing for the right reasons in order for me to have that possibility. I'm going to have to
[01:04:29] have to get a little bit medieval on some people here, right? Yeah. And you think, okay, as soon
[01:04:34] as this is over, though, I'll go right back to, you know, being on the moral high ground.
[01:04:40] But if I stay on the moral high ground this whole time, I might not even get there. So I need
[01:04:47] to position my, like there's a slippery slope there. What do you say? No, what I got to make, I got
[01:04:51] to run this negative at. I got to do this, I got to make this statement about my opponent, right?
[01:04:56] That stuff or, or I'm not going to get the publicity that I need to win. That's a slippery,
[01:05:04] that's a slippery slope. Yeah. Well, that's, yeah, that's the, the gray area that a lot of
[01:05:09] elections are are one in Austin. And, you know, maybe we should write a book after this called the
[01:05:15] decademy of politics, you know, and it's just, yeah, you have your, you know, kind of so-called default
[01:05:23] aggressive type of opinion or position on that default, you know, good guy or whatever, maybe.
[01:05:30] But then yet you have some some gray areas there where, yeah, if the elections go on bad and you
[01:05:37] feel like this person is really going to be bad for the country and for the district, then you might
[01:05:41] have to do something that you wouldn't normally do. But you kind of maintain that moral compass
[01:05:47] even with that. So you take it to a certain level and then you dial it back and you don't do it again
[01:05:52] and you don't let it kind of slip away and you can keep doing it. So you kind of have to take
[01:05:59] every situation as it's your own unique situation and kind of step out and then step back,
[01:06:04] step out and step back as needed, I guess. I think that in the end with situations like that,
[01:06:12] what it, what you have to maintain above all is you have to maintain the truth. And if you
[01:06:17] maintain the truth about what's happening, I think in the in the in the long run and oftentimes
[01:06:23] in the short run, hey, if you're telling the truth about what's going on, that's what that's what
[01:06:29] make you win. Yeah, very true. Yeah, you can kind of go negative. You can say something that's bad about
[01:06:35] the other person. But you can just say, oh, well, this negative at is this person voted for this bill
[01:06:42] that did this and that's kind of going negative, but it's not you're not, you're not, you're not
[01:06:46] just something that adds a person. And you're telling the truth. Yeah, not making something. That's a good,
[01:06:52] that's a good way to approach it. I'll let you know how it goes when I start having to make
[01:06:56] those types of decisions. Hopefully it's so obvious that I'm going to win that I won't even have
[01:07:00] to make those decisions. But what's it? You know, and that's the other weird thing about politics is
[01:07:06] you know, I used to think of the officers that were in the military and most of the time,
[01:07:16] much of the time, the officers that you wanted to work for were the kind of officers that
[01:07:23] didn't really care as not the right word, but I'm not sure how to explain it. Didn't really,
[01:07:29] they weren't all jazzed up because they were an officer. They were jazzed up to work with the
[01:07:35] troops. They were jazzed up to serve the country. They weren't doing it for their own career. Right?
[01:07:41] And it's the same thing with politics. If you think about the type of people that you would actually
[01:07:46] want to have in political power, one of the main reasons why you would want them in that position
[01:07:52] is because they would never want to be there. They're the type of people that say, well,
[01:07:58] there are people like you that say, hey, listen, this is not what I want to do, but this is kind
[01:08:02] of what I have to do. This is the void of leadership and and someone needs to fill that void. So there's
[01:08:08] another kind of dichotomy there that the person that you would actually want in that position is
[01:08:16] the person that fundamentally in their own heart doesn't really want that position. Yeah.
[01:08:21] And you end up with and it's sort of like in in man search for meaning, the book about the concentration
[01:08:28] camps and he says that the best of us didn't make it. The best of us didn't survive because the
[01:08:36] best people in the concentration camp, the purist and most good people were the people that said,
[01:08:43] hey, you take this crust bread instead of me, hey, you take all step up and do this labor that's
[01:08:51] going to push you over the edge and make you sick. I'll give you my blanket at night because we only
[01:08:56] have one for for for us and you're the one that needs it the most. Those good people they didn't
[01:09:02] survive and that's kind of it's kind of what happens in politics or it could very well. It happens
[01:09:10] in many cases in politics where the person that won't cross that line, the person that doesn't just
[01:09:16] look out for themselves first, that's the person that doesn't win because they didn't go negative,
[01:09:24] they didn't mud sling, they didn't undermine and they end up not winning. So this is a tough situation,
[01:09:33] but I think what's good is I think there's more opportunity now and I think there's a lot of things
[01:09:38] out there that level the playing field and I think one of them is social media, right? This podcast,
[01:09:43] okay, you're on here, you get to tell, you get to talk about people know your story, they hear it
[01:09:48] on a broad basis, you know, you got your own social media that you can talk directly to people and
[01:09:55] there's no filter, doesn't cost any money to put up a social media post. Now does it cost money to
[01:10:00] advertise a social media post? Yes, it does. It does. So if somebody can dump more money into that,
[01:10:05] but at least the playing field is more level than it used to be for you to get your voice out there
[01:10:11] and not have to do slimy, shady things to do it. Yeah, and then yeah with respect to what you're
[01:10:20] saying about, you know, some people didn't survive. You also have to wonder whether or not a lot of the
[01:10:26] times are some of the times surviving isn't always the best thing. So if you have to do something
[01:10:35] to just to survive and it's something that's even worse than death, then sometimes you don't want
[01:10:41] to survive and sometimes you can be fine with that. And so it's kind of the same thing with political
[01:10:46] if I have to sling mud and do all that stuff, then maybe that's maybe that's not worth it.
[01:10:52] Yeah, I don't know. I totally agree. All right, you wrote a little something about leadership and
[01:10:57] it's I was going to kind of read some chunks of it here. There's a void of true leadership in Congress.
[01:11:04] It is blatantly evident in all the modern forms of media, print, broadcast and social. It is
[01:11:12] patently obvious that the words and behaviors of many of our elected representatives at all levels
[01:11:17] and in all political parties. One needn't look further than this void to identify the root of
[01:11:22] the rotten climate in politics that is sickening the American public.
[01:11:27] There's a big chunk of the American public that are sickened by that. There's a big chunk that
[01:11:34] actually just full on participates, too. Yeah, that's true. It's crazy. I'm not too
[01:11:44] I'm not an active participant in Facebook. I mean, I have Facebook and I post on Facebook,
[01:11:50] but I don't get involved much in the personal Facebook, right? Yeah.
[01:11:58] But I hear stories about Facebook from people that are on it. It's like a crazy battleground
[01:12:05] where people on the friend you, if you make a statement or you like someone's political post
[01:12:11] that they don't agree with, it's like crazy people. Crazy people. But I like to, you know, I believe
[01:12:19] that truly believe that those people are the minority, the vast minority. I agree with you. And I
[01:12:26] said this, I said this on a podcast and every someone's like, well, there's all these extremists
[01:12:31] out there and I was like, you know what, I travel the country all the time. I work with businesses
[01:12:35] of all sizes. Oh, yeah, this is Ben Shapiro's podcast. I travel the country. I'm all over the place
[01:12:41] all the time. I work with all these companies. I work with frontline troops. I work with lead
[01:12:45] mid-level leaders. I work with CEOs. I work with everyone in the spectrum. And I don't meet people
[01:12:54] regularly that are like that. I don't know who those people are that are going crazy on Facebook.
[01:13:00] I don't meet them. I know they're out there. But yes, you're right. And I agree with you.
[01:13:04] Most people, what are they trying to do with their life? Oh, they, they're trying to, or money,
[01:13:09] they're trying to raise their family. They're trying to spend time with their family. They're trying
[01:13:11] to pay off their house. That's what they're doing. So yes, I agree that I think I will kind of
[01:13:18] retract my statement a little bit and say in that you say it's sickening to the American public. I think
[01:13:23] most people in the American public are definitely sick of it. And that's what I said to Ben Shapiro.
[01:13:28] I said, Ben, I mean, he is at, he is at what is it called? He's at Ground Zero for political fire.
[01:13:38] Yeah. And, and you know, I was on another guy named Brian Coppimman's podcast and he's like the
[01:13:44] other end of the spectrum. And actually we joked about the fact, you know, I was like, if you met Ben
[01:13:48] Shapiro, you'd like to find his a really nice guy. And Brian Coppim said, I'm not even that's cool
[01:13:52] to make sense, but they're they're completely opposite ends of the of the political spectrum.
[01:13:58] But I think that those people at the far, far ends and both of those guys can be a little bit of
[01:14:04] Ground Zero for, you know, impact and people go go crazy. Yeah. There's people that like to just
[01:14:11] stir things up, right? I mean, there's people that like to stir things up. Most people are like to
[01:14:16] stir things up in one way or another. Okay. Not necessarily politically, specifically, some people
[01:14:21] politically, but in one way or another. Oh, yeah, it's fun. Not to do it, but to see it happen. So some
[01:14:27] people they like to take part, you know. All right, moving on with this, this piece you up, the legislative
[01:14:33] branch of the United States government is comprised of 535 legislators. Many of them have begun
[01:14:37] venturing down a path that can only be characterized as the opposite of true leadership.
[01:14:42] A path that displays a lack of respect for anyone with a different worldview from them.
[01:14:47] A path that involves dehumanizing and demonizing people simply because they're a member of an opposing
[01:14:53] party. Many of these legislators have stopped viewing people's individuals and have instead applied
[01:15:00] a group identity and used it to apply group blame. Yeah. That's a Jordan Peterson line that I kind
[01:15:10] of stole. I heard him say that one time I thought was a really good line. Well, the, the, that is a true
[01:15:16] statement. Yeah. And that was, I said many. I didn't say all or anything like that either because
[01:15:23] it's kind of what we were talking about just now. The, uh, maybe sometimes
[01:15:27] you only think that the vast majority of people are doing it because they, you only hear about the
[01:15:33] people that are, that are being, you know, kind of naughty or whatever. So, yeah. So it can be, it
[01:15:39] maybe it can be said that maybe it's the minority of legislators that are, you know, kind of,
[01:15:45] going under this kind of behavior. But I think it's, there's a trend, starting to have more and more
[01:15:52] and more, it's happening. Yeah. So you also get, you also get the mob mentality, just to straight
[01:15:58] up mob mentality where it's blood in the water and the sharks are going to go crazy. And who was it?
[01:16:04] It was, um, Dave Chappelle. I was, I saw little clip of Dave Chappelle's, um, new Netflix special
[01:16:12] and he's making this joke. He says he says, uh, guess who I am? And if you do something wrong,
[01:16:20] every in your life and I find out about it. I don't care if it's in five years, 10 years, 15 years,
[01:16:26] 20 years, if I find out about it, I'm going to ruin everything you have. And he says, guess who I am?
[01:16:32] And people are yelling out different names and he goes, I'm you. Right. Yeah. That's what everyone
[01:16:37] does. That's what everyone does now does. So we get this mob mentality of, oh, you made a mistake.
[01:16:42] Are you said something that was out of line or whatever the case may be? Cool. We're going to
[01:16:46] crucify you now. That's what's going to happen. And unfortunately, in Congress anyway, they're all
[01:16:53] kind of peers. They're all kind of equals. So there's no one leader that can kind of come in,
[01:16:57] like the Meal Eye Massacre and put a stop to things. Um, so yeah, there's no way that that can really
[01:17:05] step forward and do that. Yeah. As I kind of influence. Unless you just take the moral high
[01:17:09] round and people start to see that that's the correct example. Yeah. So you kind of have to start
[01:17:14] leading. Yeah. Laterally. And I think like Dan Crunchy, I was doing a great job of that. He
[01:17:19] yeah, he is just response. He's not emotional. He just kind of, you know, states has a
[01:17:24] opinion, recognizing that there's other views tries to explain around it. Doesn't get personal with
[01:17:28] people. He's just doing a great job from that perspective. Yeah. Doesn't get fired up. No face.
[01:17:33] Does just keeps normal face all the time. He's not getting crazy. And you know, it's it's hard.
[01:17:39] I remember explaining this when we got home from Ramadi. You know, there was inside the
[01:17:46] sealed community. There were some people that were looking at the operations we did and what we did
[01:17:50] that thought, oh, why are you guys going out the daytime? Why are you guys supporting conventional
[01:17:54] operations? They're asking these questions. And basically, it's it's my fault that they were asking
[01:17:59] those questions because it means that I didn't do a good job of letting the community know
[01:18:04] why exactly we were in that position and what the strategic impact of those missions were
[01:18:09] and all those things. But I remember talking to life and Seth because I mean, coming home from
[01:18:15] Ramadi, you know, we suffered some significant casualties and to hear someone say, you know,
[01:18:21] what were you guys even doing? It's really easy to get emotional. And I sat those guys down. I'm
[01:18:25] like, listen, when you discuss this with people, if you get emotional, your your argument goes out
[01:18:33] the window because now you're just they're looking at you going, oh, he's super emotional. That's
[01:18:37] only he's he doesn't make any sense. We can't listen to what he's saying because he's emotional.
[01:18:42] Yeah. And so I said, when we when we talk about this with people, we have to just get
[01:18:47] unemotional just detached and just explain, hey, this is what we're doing here. It's what was going
[01:18:51] on. So what the conventional forces were doing, this is what the strategy was here's how we were
[01:18:55] able to help. You just have to do it like that because if you go, what are you talking? And another
[01:19:00] thing that's really easy to do is you already, but they're like getting really fired up and we can't
[01:19:05] do that. So I think Dan is doing a good job of that. And hopefully that example will continue to
[01:19:11] spread. And I know you'll you'll be doing that as well. All right, moving down. The path leads to an end
[01:19:18] point of limited to no effective communication. A lack of communication produces an environment in
[01:19:24] which no meaningful work can get accomplished. A workless environment in Congress means that
[01:19:28] a miracle will stagnate. The process and systems on which our country runs will not be able to improve.
[01:19:36] The result is that Americans will suffer. Yeah, people can't even talk people can't even talk to
[01:19:44] each other. Yeah. In Congress. Yeah, if you can't come either way. It's crazy. Like you can't,
[01:19:51] the the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the time is going to be close to
[01:19:58] 50% Democrat 50% Republican. And you rely on these other people to pass legislation and to do
[01:20:07] the job of Congress, which is to pass bills that can improve America, improves the lives of Americans.
[01:20:14] So if people can't communicate, so I could have, I could go into a committee or whatever with
[01:20:20] the cure for cancer. Like this bill will cure cancer guarantee. Even if it is, you know, what I said
[01:20:26] before where you don't know, I know for sure. This will cure cancer. But I go into committee that
[01:20:32] day of the week before, you know, representative Charles, I went on Twitter and I said,
[01:20:39] what an idiot. This guy's stupid. You know, I just did a tweet like that. He's got this to the
[01:20:45] cancer. Not voting for it. All his friends aren't voting for it because they're on his team.
[01:20:49] So that cancer bill, even though it's going to cure cancer, it's going to be the best thing ever
[01:20:54] doesn't see the light a day. So it's like you might as well not even have it.
[01:21:01] Continuing on, but there is hope. Despite them getting next to no coverage in the media,
[01:21:06] there are true leaders in Congress. We can learn from their example. A true leader
[01:21:10] recognizes that every person comes for a unique set of experiences, including their
[01:21:15] upbringing, education struggles and environment that forms their worldview, including values,
[01:21:19] priorities and perspectives. The leader also recognizes that even if an individual's an individual
[01:21:25] person's worldview is wholly opposite, then that of the leaders, it is nevertheless equally valid
[01:21:31] and worthy of consideration. The leader knows that the worldview and the person must be shown,
[01:21:38] respect. The leader gives the other person the benefit of believing that they have good intention
[01:21:44] and thoughtful and now and thoughtfully analyzes their ideas before coming to a conclusion as to their
[01:21:49] viability. I gave an answer. I think it was at the last master. So many asked this big crazy
[01:21:56] question about leadership. I will want to say something. What are you doing this about? And
[01:22:00] and I said, oh, we know you do it with that. And one of the most underutilized tools in all
[01:22:08] of leadership is to listen. Actually listen to what other people are saying. Actually listen to
[01:22:15] the people below you in the chain of command. Listen to people above you in the chain of command. Listen
[01:22:18] to your, if you're in a family, listen to what your wife, listen to what you actually listen to what
[01:22:23] people have to say. And that's what you're saying right here. Instead of as soon as your mouth opens
[01:22:28] up, I already am judging what I think you're going to say and shutting it down, is that I actually
[01:22:33] listen? I always, when I'm listening to people, I always think, why, I don't, I don't, my, my first
[01:22:39] instinct when you start saying something isn't why are you wrong. My instinct is, hey, what is
[01:22:46] this person know that I might not know? What, what about this person's perspective? It's correct
[01:22:53] that that doesn't make sense to me or that I don't understand. Continue on a true leader of
[01:23:00] Congress recognizes that America relies on the teamwork of people with opposing viewpoints. The
[01:23:06] idea of a republic is not to have 51% of the people cram an idea around the, throw to 49% of
[01:23:11] the people. Nor is it the opposite. It is to find solutions that as many people as possible can be
[01:23:16] happy with when they go to bed at night. The leader knows that the only way to achieve this is
[01:23:20] do working together. And I think that's, you'd think that that was a common sense statement.
[01:23:27] Hey, somewhere there's a happy medium that will work for a majority of the people. Right?
[01:23:31] It's not way over here. And it's not way over here. There's a little dichotomy between those
[01:23:36] two that you have to balance as a leader. Yeah, anymore it's like everybody on the other side
[01:23:40] is don't move at inch. Don't give up an inch. It's like this country was founded on something called
[01:23:46] the great compromise back in, you know, when they were right in the Constitution. Yeah, well, that
[01:23:52] idea of that every single thing is a slippery slope is something that's very hard to
[01:23:58] contend with. Yeah. Right. And I think the reason it's so hard to contend with is that
[01:24:03] folks on the extremes are so ravenous that when they do get an inch, they go cool. We got an inch.
[01:24:10] We need to take a foot. And we got a foot. Now we'll take a yard. And so both sides have that attitude.
[01:24:16] Yeah. Instead of someone coming to the table, putting the ego and check and saying, okay, you know what?
[01:24:20] But we trust that you'll do this. And you know, I think one of the things that makes America
[01:24:30] stable is that it's a tough, it's a big bureaucratic system that's hard to move. Right.
[01:24:34] It's a big bureaucratic system that's hard to move. No one person has a massive effect.
[01:24:42] They just don't. I mean, like you can steer some stuff. You can make some things happen. You can
[01:24:47] make some, you can put some laws into place, but those laws might get repealed. I mean, it's a hard
[01:24:51] place to move around. And if people understood how hard it is to move around, then maybe they can
[01:24:59] start looking at other viewpoints a little bit more, like, let's, let's actually move forward
[01:25:04] in some direction. That teamwork relies in turn on communication between these people. The leader
[01:25:12] knows the leader knows how to effectively communicate with both people that agree with them and those
[01:25:17] that don't. They communicate directly with the person. They explain their side and genuinely attempt
[01:25:23] to understand the other persons with humility, with respect, without insults. They don't sling mud
[01:25:29] in the public space effectively forever alienating that person on whom they rely for teamwork.
[01:25:35] A true leader acts selflessly in the performance of their duties. They make the decisions and
[01:25:43] implement the actions that they've truthfully think are the best interests of the people that
[01:25:48] they represent and of America. They do so even if the result is damaging to their career.
[01:25:55] They don't care about notoriety and are happy to happy in the simple knowledge that the people
[01:26:00] that do know them believe in them wholeheartedly and they are making a difference. The good news
[01:26:07] is that we have leaders like this throughout our country, summary and congress, but if America
[01:26:11] is going to continue to be the greatest country on earth, Congress needs more. Pretty straightforward.
[01:26:22] Yeah, I mean, we need people to step up and that's real. We talked about it before. That's why
[01:26:27] I decided to do it. Somebody has to be the one to enter into the arena and it's better to have
[01:26:36] somebody that has this kind of attitude, I think, then allow somebody else to do it.
[01:26:43] And I think something else, people with this attitude are going to be able to need to prevail
[01:26:52] and we need to move away from the extremist viewpoints that come out even in Congress.
[01:27:00] Because it's a tough question when you say that you look at the other people as if their intentions
[01:27:10] are good. You look into someone else and go, hey, look, what they want is what's best for America.
[01:27:18] And that's a very pure way to look at it. I will tell you that I've talked to some smart people
[01:27:24] that look at some people in politics and say they have and I've discussed this on a podcast.
[01:27:31] I'm trying to think of with who, but there's people that think, no, they don't actually want
[01:27:36] the best for America or their vision of America is different and outside what
[01:27:45] what the Constitution says. So that's another thing to think about.
[01:27:53] And I think that this attitude of people going into Congress that will actually listen,
[01:28:01] well, this is what I think will happen. The people that will go into Congress that actually
[01:28:05] listen, that actually can have meaningful conversations. I think that, or my hope is that that attitude
[01:28:13] will begin to rise to the surface that people realize that what you want, you know, the very first podcast
[01:28:21] I interviewed I ever did was with Tim Ferriss and he asked something about leadership and I talked
[01:28:26] about humility and then I talked about being balanced. And I think what people, hopefully in America,
[01:28:32] we'll start to realize is that what we want is not, are not people on the extremes, but people
[01:28:39] that are balanced and can communicate and listen, which is what you are bringing to the table.
[01:28:46] Yeah, and the reason that a lot of the times people get elected that have these kind of extreme
[01:28:52] views is because it gets coverage, it gets their name out there, people find out who they are
[01:28:56] and what they're saying kind of scares the person and the person is kind of reacting and, you know,
[01:29:00] from that fear. And so I think, you know, that I have a little bit of an advantage here where
[01:29:06] I can be kind of with this attitude and I can still get coverage because, you know,
[01:29:13] I am a wounded veteran and I've done so much service and I've done all these things that I've done.
[01:29:17] So people are more likely to want to, you know, tell my story because, you know, it's a
[01:29:23] relatively compelling story. It's a very compelling story. I was talking about Travis Mills the other day
[01:29:29] and unfortunately we didn't have time to do a podcast, but we were talking about stuff and I was like,
[01:29:36] well, you know, you have a great story and it's the same thing I feel like saying to you, like, man,
[01:29:40] you, you've got a good story, right? You've got a great story. And you think, well, and I said,
[01:29:44] halfway through this conversation with Travis, I'm like, hey, bro, I just want to let you know, like,
[01:29:48] I get that it's not exactly your great story. That you know, you got blown up and lost both
[01:29:54] your legs and both your arms and even same thing with you, like, hey, and you're saying it, too,
[01:29:58] you're like, hey, I've got a good story. And it's like, okay, I just want to let everyone know,
[01:30:03] I get that losing both your legs and Afghanistan is not exactly a good story. However, what you
[01:30:09] done with it has you've taken what would be in many cases a horrible story. Yeah. And you actually
[01:30:14] truly have turned it into a good story, which is exactly what which is exactly what Travis does.
[01:30:18] Well, it's a good story overall with a really bad inciting incident. Yeah. And so that's what it is,
[01:30:26] you know, the whole story isn't that one day. It's what happens afterwards. And so that's the
[01:30:31] story. But there, yeah, there doesn't mean there's bad. There's not bad things in that story.
[01:30:35] But overall, you know, it's probably, I don't know how Travis feels. Maybe I'll ask him if I ever
[01:30:40] meet him. But if you ask me, if I went back in time and you asked me a week after I got hurt
[01:30:50] or a couple of hours after I got hurt or whatever, whenever I woke up, you know,
[01:30:54] would you go back in time and not step on that idea? I'd say, oh, definitely. I'd go, I'd just say,
[01:30:59] let's not even go through this area. Let's go around. But you know, I'm in my house now and,
[01:31:06] you know, here's a big announcement. We got a baby on the way in Pam. Yeah, thank you.
[01:31:12] So we have a baby coming. There's the real announcement. Yeah, there's the real announcement. I should have
[01:31:16] said that earlier. A little boy doing February. And we got this nice house. I have a great life,
[01:31:25] you know, I think about that. And if somebody asked me right now, if you asked me, if I would go back
[01:31:31] in time and not step in the idea, be like hell, no, I would step on that idea, a thousand times,
[01:31:36] to be where I am today. And I think that's important to remember about, you know,
[01:31:40] so it is a good story. If you can have that attitude at the end of it, that's a good story.
[01:31:45] There's no doubt about that, man. Dang. You know, as we were talking about leadership and
[01:31:51] I was reading through some of the stuff you written, I could not help myself, but to refer back to
[01:31:57] the United States Marine Corps leadership traits. Of course. And these traits are originally,
[01:32:06] I think, I think the first place that I saw is in the Marine Corps Warfighting Publication 6
[01:32:12] TAC 11, which is called leading Marines. And it's in a bunch of other, they quote this all the time.
[01:32:19] Yeah. They quote this all the time. The particular comments that I have around here came from
[01:32:26] the Commander's Leadership Handbook, which was came out. It's a Marine Corps publication. It's not
[01:32:30] it's not an official publication, but it's something that they put out in 2016. And they made some
[01:32:38] comments around the US Marine Corps leadership traits. JGA did tie buckle. Right. What's that
[01:32:47] called when you do that? Is it called the, the NAC? Yeah, it's an acronym, I guess. But it's also an easy
[01:32:52] way to remember things. So they got these, they got these, uh, certain words. That's what it spells out.
[01:32:58] It spells out. JGA did tie buckle. I bet it's a buckle that has all the brass. Yeah, probably.
[01:33:06] First one is justice. Practice being fair and consistent, base rewards and punishment on merit.
[01:33:12] Straight forward, fair and consistent. Judgment. And this is, this is again, as I was thinking
[01:33:19] about these, thinking about you, thinking about what you're going to think about what you're
[01:33:22] out of two days. Here's what they say about judgment. Consider all sides of an issue before making
[01:33:27] a decision. G, what a, what a shocking idea. Yeah. That we would actually consider all sides
[01:33:34] of an issue before making a decision. And as a leader, clearly that's something, it's interesting.
[01:33:41] Right. You think to yourself, judgment means I make good decisions. That's what judgment means.
[01:33:46] I have good judgment. But what they're saying is judgment is you actually just consider the different
[01:33:52] angles before you make a decision. They're talking about how you come to that decision. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:33:57] And how do you come to that decision by listening? Yeah. That's how you come to that decision.
[01:34:02] Dependability. Here's a good one. Beyond time never make your Marines wait on you. What a
[01:34:09] stroke of leadership genius. That is never let you never make your Marines wait on you.
[01:34:16] And that is something that you see with leaders as they get advanced, as they get promoted.
[01:34:22] And all of a sudden, they don't think they need to be on time anymore. They think that everyone
[01:34:26] is there waiting for them. And that is just a horrible example to set. Be dependable. Meet deadlines.
[01:34:37] Ensure paperwork is processed efficiently and effectively in order to best care for your Marines.
[01:34:44] We're here to take care of our Marines. And again, you take this and you apply this to your
[01:34:49] attitude going into Congress. What do you therefore to take care of your constituents?
[01:34:53] Yeah. And they're depending on me to do that. So I have to be dependable to them.
[01:34:56] If they had to double check my work all the time, you know, that's kind of the the whole purpose
[01:35:02] of a representative, you know, governmental system is that we're trusting, we're depending upon
[01:35:07] this one person to represent our, you know, our issues and what we need. And so if they had to
[01:35:14] be double checking me all the time, then they might as well just, they think they're,
[01:35:19] they're not going to have any time because it's a full time job to figure out all the different
[01:35:23] stuff about all these issues and figure out what to do and go in and vote and all that. So they
[01:35:26] wouldn't be able to work. Everybody would just be a representative and nobody would ever get anything
[01:35:30] down besides running the government. Which would not work. Yeah. They have to depend.
[01:35:36] They have to depend on that person. Next up in Tagrity, the most important ingredient of leadership
[01:35:42] tell the truth to both your superiors and your Marines. There you go. We talked about truth already.
[01:35:50] Always use your authority for mission accomplishment, not for personal gain. That would be a big
[01:35:57] one to run across the entire United States government. How much how many people do things for
[01:36:04] their personal gain and not for? Yeah. You wonder. The good of the country. You wonder how many people
[01:36:09] are just concerned about having a political career. And I'll say right now, I'm willing to
[01:36:14] sacrifice any kind of political career and do the right thing. You know, I'll, I'll find something else
[01:36:19] if that's what it takes. I'll run 50 marathons. Next one is decisive.
[01:36:27] This study your alternatives and take the best possible course of action. No win, not to, no win,
[01:36:34] not to step in and make a decision. That's an interesting one from leadership perspective.
[01:36:40] I got a new book coming out in January 2020. And I talk a lot about not a lot. There's a
[01:36:49] couple of sections in there where I talk about how to know when to step up and lead it.
[01:36:52] I went into pretty good detail and it's really cool for me to write this stuff because I
[01:36:57] get to sit there from a detached perspective and think of all these situations that I've been in
[01:37:01] and how I would handle them. But one of them is when there's a little bit of a leadership vacuum.
[01:37:07] When do you step in? And I went into this pretty big explanation of, okay, well, obviously there's
[01:37:13] a leadership vacuum and there's like a emergency situation and you see that vacuum you step in there immediately.
[01:37:18] But and this is as I would think about how I would actually do this. If there's a leadership vacuum,
[01:37:24] but there's no critical emergency, my first instinct isn't just to step right in immediately.
[01:37:29] Because I'm going to let that thing develop a little bit. I'm going to see if somebody else
[01:37:33] I'm actually hoping one of my subordinate steps into that leadership vacuum. And then I get to
[01:37:38] stay detached and I get to watch what the decisions they're making and see with the direction. It's all good.
[01:37:42] And then I talked about what happens if two people step into that leadership vacuum at the same time.
[01:37:49] What do you do? What if I step into the leadership vacuum and so does echo Charles?
[01:37:53] At the same time we step into that leadership vacuum. What do I do? Can you guess what I do echo Charles?
[01:37:58] Let me lead. Yes, I immediately go. You know, if you and I both say,
[01:38:02] I say go left, you say go right. Right at that moment. I say go left, you say go right. I go,
[01:38:06] hey, all right echo, we're going with your plan. I'm going immediately. Going to do that.
[01:38:10] I mean, considering that there's no major catastrophic incident. If if if somebody steps up and
[01:38:15] take lead, I'm happy to follow. Especially if it's my subordinate. Because now as soon as echo is
[01:38:19] now, I'm going to take that problem and he's going to run with it. I can look around and see what else
[01:38:23] a sea would else is going on. Look at the bigger picture. So yeah, it's interesting when you look at
[01:38:29] these leadership vacuum and how you actually handle them. The other thing I talked about is this,
[01:38:33] this is getting detailed. But if we're in a situation, let's say we're in a putoon and there's a leadership
[01:38:39] vacuum and I immediately try and jump into the leadership vacuum as soon as I see it. Guess what?
[01:38:44] Not everyone else saw that vacuum. Not everyone else felt it and there's people. There's going to be
[01:38:48] some resistance to you changing course right now. If I let that situation develop for eight more seconds,
[01:38:56] six more seconds, 20 more seconds, whatever whatever it is, where all of a sudden people go
[01:39:01] way to second, there's a leadership vacuum. Meanwhile, I'm sitting detached and I'm going as soon as
[01:39:06] I, as soon as the moment's right I'm making a call and now everyone is waiting for the call. They're
[01:39:11] waiting to be led in by the way, the decision that I'm about to make. I've already assessed that
[01:39:14] it's a good call. So there's all these little things to think about when it comes to being decisive.
[01:39:20] And another thing I say is, be as make your decisions as late as possible, which is a little bit
[01:39:26] weird, right? It sounds counterintuitive. No, you just make a call immediately. No, actually,
[01:39:32] I'll make a, this is what I say. I will make the smallest decision I need to make
[01:39:37] heading in the right direction of what I think the broader decision that needs to be made is.
[01:39:41] So I want just to meet you say, Frank left. No, the first thing I'm going to say is, okay,
[01:39:45] get online, put some of the machine gunners over to left. We think we're moving that way,
[01:39:48] but we're not going there yet. So this idea of being decisive has got a lot of little nuance to
[01:39:55] it that you need to think about. Next one, tacked, talk with your Marines, not at them.
[01:40:01] That's a good idea with your constituents, right? Treat others as you would like to be treated,
[01:40:06] be steadfast during crisis, stay calm and steer your command and stormy weather. When reacting
[01:40:11] to bad news, know that initial reports are nearly always wrong and then they throw this out. Listen,
[01:40:18] first. And I had, I think I read a different one because I have some quotes down here,
[01:40:24] but I have, there's all kinds of the Marines that have the all kinds of different,
[01:40:28] and not just official Marines, but just people, human beings. Well, the one that I read,
[01:40:34] had a picture of Chester Polar on it, so I think that's probably the most official. Solid.
[01:40:39] But the one of the quotes for tacked that I liked from the one that I read is,
[01:40:45] this difference must be extended under all conditions regardless of true feelings.
[01:40:51] Yes. So I could hate, I could sit across a table and hate physically hate another legislator,
[01:40:59] hate everything they stand for, hate their soul. But I'm going to sit down and listen to them.
[01:41:03] So, okay. That's a good point. Yeah. I'm not going to go on Twitter. Yeah.
[01:41:08] And you actually are listening to. Yeah. I will. Yeah. Actually, I've been just playing the game like
[01:41:12] okay. I just got to do this. No, it's like, I'm actually listening to what you're saying. I,
[01:41:15] I actually want to prove myself wrong. Yeah. It's really, I do, I want to be wrong. I want
[01:41:19] you to be like, how much, how much easier is my life? If you and I want to get a project done,
[01:41:24] you have a way of doing it, and I have a way of doing it. How much easier and better is it for me,
[01:41:28] if your way is works better than mine. Yeah. It makes my whole life easier. Okay, cool. I get you
[01:41:33] got my support 100% of you. Yeah. I know you're voting for you. And as long as it's a good
[01:41:37] plan, guess what? I get to vote for you too. And I'm happy. Yeah. As opposed to me having to argue and
[01:41:42] try and pry your vote from you to meet to do the project the way I said, yeah. That's already
[01:41:47] wasted hours. If not days. If, if you come up with a decent enough plan, brah, Montbord. Yeah.
[01:41:55] And then even at the end, you can, you honestly consider what they said. And then your assessment
[01:42:00] is this person, that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You don't say,
[01:42:05] this is a dumbest idea I've ever heard. It's never going to work. You say, okay.
[01:42:10] All right. Well, I don't know. Maybe that might not be, yeah. How I would go with it,
[01:42:14] well, what can you consider this? Yeah. And you don't just like, you act tactfully. Yes.
[01:42:19] To act tact. Initiative. Take action, even in the absence of orders from a superior, be a self-starter.
[01:42:25] Plan ahead and have three hip pocket plans for contingencies. Always look to improve,
[01:42:30] learn from your mistakes. Initiative.
[01:42:37] Endurance. I actually was laughing when I read about it.
[01:42:41] I'm especially right. Yeah. I think we'll be okay with endurance.
[01:42:44] Maintain mental and physical stamina. No winter recharge. Most people who quit do not give
[01:42:49] up at the bottom of the mountain, they stop halfway up it. So endurance, as I said, I don't think we need
[01:42:57] to even, I think you will, I think you will be the premier endurance person in Congress period.
[01:43:05] I'll become quite good at it. Very good at it.
[01:43:09] Bearing set the example by maintaining high standards and appearance and personal conduct,
[01:43:13] avoid the use of profanity. High-like that, ankle trials. I'm fine with it. At the end of the day,
[01:43:23] be professional, develop gentlemen and ladies and future citizens. Have you heard there's been some
[01:43:29] some pretty high profile politicians that have dropped some language. It gets like immediate press.
[01:43:36] Yeah. Let's see if you drop the F-ball. If you drop the F-ball, I'm on national television.
[01:43:40] You're going to get some coverage. You may not be good. May not be bad. I don't know. You can't be good.
[01:43:45] Yeah. I think one of this general madness recently is a great example for all of these lists.
[01:43:53] Especially lately for this because he came out with his book and he's constantly being
[01:44:00] picked at by people that are doing interviews like say something about Trump. Say something about
[01:44:04] Trump. And he's come out so many times saying, I'm not going to comment about a sitting president
[01:44:09] and they just keep asking and they ask, I'm going to do it for a while. And he's just
[01:44:14] he maintains his bearing. Yeah. He does indeed. Unselfishness, care for your Marines above yourself,
[01:44:22] boom. Once again, that goes back to your constituents. Yeah. Taking care of your constituents,
[01:44:27] not, and you just said, it's not about your political career. Take every action to provide for
[01:44:31] the welfare of your Marines. They always come first. Courage. Take measure risk and combat and
[01:44:40] peace at Combin firmly and stressful situation stand up for what is right. regards what others think.
[01:44:49] Except personal responsibility for your orders and for your mistakes. I think they should
[01:44:54] actually call that something else like extreme owners. I want to run that even in the face of
[01:45:00] popular, disfavor. What you're doing. So you have to do it even when. If you know that it's
[01:45:07] if you believe that it's the right thing to do no matter how many people are telling you,
[01:45:12] it's the wrong thing. You have to have to have the courage to stand out from the group and put
[01:45:17] yourself out there. And what makes that work, what makes that not an extreme is the fact that has to
[01:45:23] be balanced with the humility to listen to other people. Right? Because if I'm just saying, well,
[01:45:28] you know, this is what I believe and I'm sticking with it. But I'm not listening to everyone else.
[01:45:31] That's a problem. If I'm listening to people, but I'm coming up with my judgment and my judgment is the
[01:45:35] same. And I'm listening to more people. And people are telling me, no, that's you shouldn't do it. That
[01:45:40] way it's going to lose your next election. But you believe it's the right thing to do. You do it.
[01:45:46] That's courage. Correct Marines when required. That's that's a good one.
[01:45:54] Because you would think that that's so easy in the military. You know, somebody steps out of line.
[01:46:00] You just straight them out. I mean, it's kind of interesting because in the sealed teams,
[01:46:06] I know that's hard. It's interesting that the Marine Corps finds that hard as well.
[01:46:11] Because the Marine Corps more rank sensitive, right? The sealed teams is not rank sensitive.
[01:46:18] It's basically open. It's almost completely open. But it's definitely
[01:46:24] more open than Marine Corps trust me. But you would think that in the Marine Corps, hey,
[01:46:29] if Lance Corp will do something stupid, you're just going to straighten them out immediately.
[01:46:33] And that's true to some extent. But when you get to, hey, you know, you got somebody maybe that's
[01:46:39] your peer that's doing something wrong. Are you going to say something? And it becomes a lot more
[01:46:45] challenging. Allow some ordinance to make decisions. Yeah, that takes courage as well.
[01:46:50] Knowledge works, works towards technical tactical administrative excellence. Read, study, think,
[01:46:58] write and teach. Think about that. Read, study, think, write and teach. Those things are so
[01:47:07] underrated. Read, study, think, write and teach. And actually, I think think
[01:47:13] should go forth. No, it should go last. Because all those other things allow you to think.
[01:47:25] Those are things that make you think. If you want, if you read something you have to think about,
[01:47:29] if you study something you think about it, if when you write out your thoughts or even talk about
[01:47:33] your thoughts, that's going to make you think. And it's going to make you home those thoughts.
[01:47:40] And teaching them absolutely will do that. You learn not in GJC, the more you teach those
[01:47:44] moves, the better you get out of. Loyalty display faithfulness to your country, the core,
[01:47:50] to your unit, to your seniors, to your subordinates and to your peers. Defend your
[01:47:55] Marines against unfair treatment. Display enthusiasm, carrying out an order, even if you
[01:48:01] may privately disagree. Now, here's where I got to, you know, I thought about that one a little bit.
[01:48:07] Because if I privately disagree and it's relatively minor, cool, we're going to carry it out.
[01:48:15] The more, the alls I'm saying is that you reach to a point, you can reach a point where if you're
[01:48:20] telling me to do something that makes no sense whatsoever, it's going to get people killed or it's
[01:48:24] immoral, illegal or unethical, I'm not going to carry it out. And there's a hole, there's a hole,
[01:48:35] just gray area around that one. Because if sometimes if you don't carry it out, you're going to
[01:48:44] get fired. And now you don't have any influence anymore, which is not, which is possibly not a good
[01:48:51] outcome. So enthusiasm. I don't think, I don't think this is another one. I think you just
[01:49:00] win that category. Why wrote this one down is, I wrote, my one note underneath it was belief.
[01:49:07] Based on what I read, and since you have to believe that what you're doing is possible,
[01:49:12] even if you think it maybe there's not a great likelihood, like I believed that when I was going
[01:49:18] through a danger area looking for ideas that I would get to the other side, you know, uningered.
[01:49:24] And I had to have that belief in order to be able to do it. I had to believe that there was
[01:49:29] at least a small chance that I could run 31 back to back Marathons. But I didn't believe it at all.
[01:49:34] I would ran one and then just been like, I quit. So, and then, you know, in Congress, you have to
[01:49:40] believe that you can make a difference. You have to believe that you can convince this other person
[01:49:46] or learn something from that other person that will convince you, you have to actually believe that.
[01:49:50] So that's kind of how I interpreted the enthusiasm one. Yeah, like I said, I think you're,
[01:49:56] I think I think endurance and enthusiasm. I think anyone had a hard time sort of stepping up to the
[01:50:03] plate with you in those respects. And then that wraps up, you know, these leadership traits from the
[01:50:11] Marine Corps. And, you know, it's probably a pretty good place to wrap up what were, you know,
[01:50:18] this podcast, except for one more thing. And that's, we talked a lot about what you're doing right now.
[01:50:22] People are going to want to support you because they listen to the podcast, they're patriots.
[01:50:31] They want to have reasonable human beings running the government, not crazy people. So,
[01:50:39] what's the best way to, for everyone to support what you're doing to get you the, the funds that
[01:50:47] you need to support that you need. How do we do that? Yeah, well, you know, there's a lot of different ways.
[01:50:55] You kind of were in a difficult period, you know, in our country and we have what we were talking
[01:51:00] about with the poison is slowly making its way into the government and feeding out into the
[01:51:05] society and it's kind of breaking apart, you know, the glue that holds us together. And so we do need to
[01:51:12] make sure that, you know, a lot of people are going to, I know that a lot of the people that
[01:51:18] listen to this podcast, I'm not going to directly represent them in Virginia 10, which is, you know,
[01:51:23] Northern Virginia. But we have, you know, everybody knows that the decisions that are made
[01:51:31] in the federal government, they affect everybody in some way. So, I do think that we all have a
[01:51:37] responsibility to make sure that the correct people get elected in every office and in every location.
[01:51:46] And I truly believe that I can be, I have the, the JJ did type buckle attributes to be a person
[01:51:55] that can go to Congress and, and how a positive effect I'm not going to do it all by myself. I'm
[01:51:59] not going to go in there and be the one person that saves the world or anything. But I do think that I
[01:52:05] can start taking it back in that, that other direction, you know, get what they and cringe,
[01:52:09] I'll get with Brian Mass and form these, you know, these coalitions that we can start
[01:52:15] having a positive effect on, on the way things are going in Congress. So there's a couple
[01:52:20] different ways that people can help. They can, you know, there's volunteering. If you do live in my
[01:52:24] district, you can, you can volunteer and you can, we will need people to go out and knock on doors
[01:52:30] and pass out stuff and make phone calls and that kind of thing eventually. You can just tell
[01:52:35] people, spread the word about, you know, who I am and that I'm running. But I think the way that
[01:52:42] people can have the greatest impact is what we were talking about before and it is the fundraising.
[01:52:49] You know, if I could, I hate asking for money. And if I could fund this whole thing myself,
[01:52:53] if I had millions of dollars, then I would. But, you know, I'm from humble means, I don't, I simply
[01:53:00] don't have, you know, I don't have the money. And you're doing this on myself. Your wife's run
[01:53:03] the farm right now, right? Yeah, Pam's run in the farm. And so, you know, are you guys selling food?
[01:53:09] Are you guys putting some stuff on the farm? Yeah, she goes down to the farmers market every Saturday
[01:53:12] and she sells vegetables and she'll be selling eggs soon. So yeah, you know, we were how many chickens
[01:53:17] you got? We got 40. Yeah, man. We just started getting, they just started laying eggs.
[01:53:24] So we're starting to get like seven eight eggs. And I'll only eat five every day so I can't keep
[01:53:28] up with them. But they're, we're going to start selling eggs. And then so yeah, the farm is really
[01:53:34] taken off for Pam. And she's, you know, obviously she's a incredibly supportive of what I'm doing
[01:53:39] and I wouldn't be doing it without her support. Yeah. So we're, you know, we're a humble family.
[01:53:45] And you know, it's simply don't have the money. And we are talking, my, you know, the current representative,
[01:53:51] she's raised over a million dollars already just this year. Because he has those apparatus
[01:53:55] in place and she's the incumbent. So she gets a lot of support. So we are talking about that kind of
[01:54:03] dollar sign where it costs millions of dollars to buy the advertising on the TV, on Facebook,
[01:54:11] on Instagram, on Twitter, and all these different places by the road signs, by the flyers, you know,
[01:54:16] by cards, all these things that takes millions of millions of dollars. So, you know, if everybody
[01:54:22] that listens to this podcast, if you, I know a lot of people write in questions,
[01:54:28] saying when is John, why don't you go and life, going to start running for office?
[01:54:32] You know, everybody asks that. And he listened the hard fact is,
[01:54:36] John goes not running for office. He's leading in a different way in a just as important way,
[01:54:41] you know, leading in society and in business too. And so he's not running for office. And
[01:54:47] life isn't running for office either. But so this is your opportunity here. You've heard what I think.
[01:54:52] I've been on the podcast three times. I read the books. I am on board with the extreme ownership
[01:54:57] mentality and the attitudes. So this is an opportunity for people that want to see somebody that
[01:55:02] is bought into this in Congress. This is your opportunity to help make that happen. And so if you
[01:55:09] want to donate, you go to Rob Jones for Congress dot com slash donate. And even if it's a dollar,
[01:55:17] $10 whatever, I know you still get around a million downloads, uh, provide cast on like that.
[01:55:23] John, what about that? Yeah. So let's say a million people donate a dollar. That's a million
[01:55:27] box that is huge. That puts me way, way, way far ahead in the game. And the game. Yeah. And
[01:55:34] so that's the best way. And you know, do it now. As you're listening to this, just get on your
[01:55:43] phone and do it right now. It's it's pretty quick. Don't make me like be like my friend Frank
[01:55:49] and have to chase them out three times Frank, you know, don't be Frank. And do it now. And if you
[01:55:57] really can't do it now, send yourself a notification. So as you remember, call your wife, send
[01:56:04] her voice mail and say, hey, remind me to donate when I get home. So take ownership of that as well.
[01:56:12] And so this is your opportunity. So that's the best way. And that's going to the way that people
[01:56:17] can help them. Something I noticed yesterday that you have, so you had your Facebook, your Twitter,
[01:56:24] your Instagram and your YouTube. And your old one used to be called Rob Jones journey. Yeah.
[01:56:29] Right. And now that is that gone? No, that's still there. Uh, now you have Rob Jones for Congress
[01:56:34] and on Facebook. You have at Rob Jones VA on Twitter and Rob Jones for Congress on the Graham.
[01:56:42] The Graham. Yeah. Yeah. So the reason that I have, I'm trying to keep Rob Jones journey in
[01:56:49] the political stuff separate. Because I know the people that follow me on Rob Jones journey don't
[01:56:53] necessarily want to see political stuff all the time. So I'm trying to keep those two things
[01:56:57] separate. So that's why I have the different handles for, you know, for this project. And yeah,
[01:57:02] it's interesting. That's interesting call. I don't agree with it. Yeah. It definitely, you know,
[01:57:07] it would be it'd be a bonus to have the 8,000, you know, Instagram followers that I have all
[01:57:12] getting my, you know, political stuff. But I can do, I kind of want to make sure that I maintain that
[01:57:17] that separation. Yeah. So that's another thing. It's just follow Rob Jones. Yeah. Follow me on all these
[01:57:23] things. Smash the follow button. Sure. Awesome. Well, that's, that's like, that's where we got to do.
[01:57:34] We got to give you some support and get you the funds that you need to make this happen.
[01:57:42] Yes. And yeah, like I said, I had asked him for money. But it's the the down fortunate part.
[01:57:49] It's the way the system works right now. It's the way you play the game. It's the way you play the game.
[01:57:54] And we play the win. All right. Echo. Yes. Rob, we got Rob here. Obviously he's, you know, on the path
[01:58:04] multiple ways. Is there anything that we need to do kind of get on the path over here on our side?
[01:58:11] Can I bring up a few more things? I had like like just a couple funny things at the end.
[01:58:16] Now that we're doing support. Yeah. Yeah. We're in support mode. Yes. Okay. My first thing. This is
[01:58:23] directed directly at Echo Charles. Sure. You know how you guys were talking. You were doing the
[01:58:29] the Marine Corps, you know, grading system for everybody. Yeah. What was the, the number 174
[01:58:36] Eminemly. Yeah. And any qualifying. And below that. What was the one below that? I don't, I don't know.
[01:58:40] Doesn't matter to you. Yeah. So that's what this is. Anyway, I'm sure a lot of people have this problem.
[01:58:47] Where I'll be listening to the podcast and you guys will be talking about some and I want to
[01:58:51] cut into the podcast. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh. Here's something funny that I could say. So I'm sure a lot of
[01:58:57] people have that problem. And the vast majority of the time, I'm listening to the podcast when I'm
[01:59:01] working out or driving in the car or something. So I can't write it down. But this one stuck in my mind.
[01:59:05] And so it was when Echo Charles, he was talking about. He said the expertly qualified
[01:59:16] Mario player is the, is the, is the, the man, the person that can go through the entire
[01:59:21] Super Mario game with one guy. I won't be working out by the way without warping. And I just wanted
[01:59:28] to bring up that the eminently qualified Super Mario Brothers player would be the people that
[01:59:35] can do the whole game one guy in less than four minutes, which is the world record. Yeah. So that's a
[01:59:43] good thought. But when you go, when you go into these, don't get robbed any money for getting
[01:59:48] you out. It's triggered. I'm not gonna disagree. I'm not gonna disagree. I'll agree, but with additional
[01:59:57] stuff. So I wouldn't say that that would be the standard because you can go, okay, I can go for time
[02:00:02] for sure. Or I could go for points and get all the coins. Same. Same. Then you could go, I can go
[02:00:09] for time and coins or time and points. Same. So because if you just go for coins, you're not killing
[02:00:17] everybody. If you're going for time and coins. Yeah. Yeah. But if you're going for time and points,
[02:00:21] you're going for coins, killing everybody as fast as you can. So I think that might be the, well,
[02:00:27] that's a very good point. You're the same. And maybe we'll let the, let the listeners decide.
[02:00:31] And the thing is I know that because I've tried that for the time. And I remember it. Oh,
[02:00:36] I'm doing it. No, I didn't do it. I did not break the record, but I do remember, hey, I didn't kill
[02:00:40] anybody. I skipped so many coins, which I usually get because I care about how many mana have.
[02:00:44] Same. Same. You know, 100 coins, get an extra man. Okay. I'm saying. Yeah, I don't really,
[02:00:49] I don't know how this ties in 100%. But it does tie in some percent. So when we would be,
[02:00:54] when I first got the teams, we would do like shooting competitions. Yeah. And, you know,
[02:00:59] you'd have to run to this spot, shoot, hear shoot these number of targets, run to a different spot,
[02:01:04] throw the put on the Rucksack, drag it, whatever you do this stuff, and then you shoot more targets.
[02:01:09] And if you missed the target, it was like a certain deduction, right? And there would be somebody
[02:01:15] that would just go, you know what? They would figure it out in their head that the shooting didn't
[02:01:20] really. If the person didn't set up the course correctly, I could just run through this thing, just dump rounds.
[02:01:27] And with that is 100%. And then everyone would look at that guy that did that and just think
[02:01:35] loser, right? To just not eat to just, hey, I'm just going to, I'm going to win the technicality
[02:01:41] of this game, but without, without really truly encompassing the spirit or embracing the spirit of
[02:01:49] the game. So that would almost be like, if you did that, you were going to get shunned from the group.
[02:01:58] Yeah, I can do that. I mean, I'm so far ahead of the doesn't have that spirit of like killing everything.
[02:02:03] You do a kind of because you have to or, you know, it helps you whatever. So I get the time thing.
[02:02:08] And four minutes, I don't think you could do all 32 levels in four minutes. No, they usually want to use glitches in the game.
[02:02:14] Okay, that's a good one. That's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one.
[02:02:15] We're defeating the spirit. Yeah. So we're all, we're kind of on the level then, right?
[02:02:20] Yeah, we are fully. And so I guess, and I kind of get though too like, okay, you're just going to run
[02:02:25] through the course throw rounds down range and you don't care, but you're going to win, right?
[02:02:28] You can do it. Save the princess. Yeah, save the princess. You can look at it and say,
[02:02:32] you know what, hey, I won. Whatever. Save the princess. Yeah. But then we get back to what we were talking
[02:02:37] about earlier. Are you really going to throw your morals out the window just to get the W.
[02:02:41] Just get the world record. My recommendation is no, don't do that. You have a mark on the
[02:02:47] decision. Okay. You play the game correctly. Yes, my recommendation. Well, okay. So. All right,
[02:02:53] that's point number one off point that point number one. Okay. The next one is a story. And I found
[02:02:58] it to be interesting, but stop me if you've already heard it. And there's a story about an African-American
[02:03:05] boy when Washington was crossing the Delaware. So he was coming up across the Delaware on Christmas
[02:03:13] day. And there were the an African-American man and an African-American son. And he the the man
[02:03:19] wanted to join the army to help General Washington. And the boy wanted to fight as well, but he was
[02:03:24] too young, he was about 11. General Washington said you're too young. But what you can do for us,
[02:03:29] is you can stay back here on this side of the river and you can mind the horses and you can hold
[02:03:36] this, you can make sure that this lantern stays a light to be it so that we know where we can go.
[02:03:42] They would guide us back after the after we win the battle. And that night they they went in
[02:03:48] they they won the battle and it was a freezing cold night and that little boy they came back.
[02:03:53] He had frozen to death, but the lantern was still lit and that little boy's name, Jocco.
[02:04:03] So that's your that before? Well, you know, I don't know, I had not heard that before. You know,
[02:04:08] have you ever seen the little Jockey? Yeah, that's where I saw him. That's yeah, that I know that
[02:04:12] that guy is called Jocco. Well, that's the legend. It came in. He is a little African-American little
[02:04:18] Jockey dude. Yeah. Exactly. No, apparently General Washington, and this is all, you know,
[02:04:24] legend or whatever. I don't know if it actually happened, but I know because this sounds like there could
[02:04:27] be some urban legend to this whole thing. So apparently we don't know if this is true. Apparently General
[02:04:33] Washington, he had a memorial statue built and that's what the little Jockey statue is.
[02:04:39] And then those statues were supposedly used in the underground railroad to tell people
[02:04:44] where they were safe. Okay, so that's that one. Okay. And my last one, it's kind of serious
[02:04:52] because I actually have beef. Jocco and I have beef. I know. So here's what happened.
[02:05:00] We need to squash it. Here's what happened. Moved into a nice little town called Middleburg.
[02:05:06] Actually, I was having a house built in Middleburg and earlier this year was finally finished.
[02:05:14] And while this house is being built, I was living in Vienna, Virginia, and then Leesburg,
[02:05:19] Virginia, which are all kind of around Middleburg, Virginia. And after I went on the podcast
[02:05:24] second time, I was contacted by a guy that I know, and then you know, I think echo Charles and
[02:05:31] Ozam, his name is Dave Burke. Good deal, Dave. It's contacted by this gentleman.
[02:05:40] And he said, let's meet up sometime. Posted, okay, where do you live? He said, I live in Aldi.
[02:05:45] Aldi, Virginia. And I went on that, I was like, oh, that's like five miles from where I live.
[02:05:51] Well, I'm going to be living in a Middleburg. And then like, oh, man, all right, I'm going to have a friend.
[02:05:57] Got a neighbor out in Middleburg. They didn't have a built in neighbor. And then we build the house.
[02:06:03] I'm about to move in. And I see a Facebook post by this Dave Burke says, the the
[02:06:10] Berks are moving. I go, you guys are moving? Right, what I'm moving in? And Dave says,
[02:06:18] yeah, well, you know, Jocco had this big opportunity for me out here in San Diego. So the beef
[02:06:24] is that Jocco stole my friend. Dang, friend and neighbor stole and well, if it makes you
[02:06:30] feel even better, which it probably won't when he did announce to us or to me anyway,
[02:06:34] that he was coming to California. I was fired up too. Like, how you weren't fired up? I was
[02:06:38] in Versus fired up. You know, opposite. And then he moves out of here, moves up to Carl's back.
[02:06:43] So it's like, you know, another one of those deals, man. So think both. Yeah, that's the thing last
[02:06:48] not I was here. Originally, me and Dave were going to meet up at fills. Yeah, yeah. And there was
[02:06:53] a possibility. There was a possibility that you were going to call. Yeah, because fills as we know
[02:06:58] is 200 meters from victory MMA and fitness. It is it is possibly my favorite, um,
[02:07:07] oh, it's definitely my favorite barbecue now. I'm actually not, I'm not going to play around.
[02:07:11] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we can get Dave going well. No, no, why the burger? No, no,
[02:07:17] Dave's got the Salt Lake. He's got another, he's got a couple. Dave's got a couple, but you know,
[02:07:21] for him being from Texas, anything like to even consider the fact that a barbecue outside of Texas
[02:07:31] could be your number one. You, that is, that is blasphemy for life. 100% blasphemy. So yes,
[02:07:38] fills barbecue. And I'll tell you what, Tim Kennedy came up and he lives in Texas. And I took
[02:07:43] him to fills and I said, hey, bros, just stand by and he had cut weight for like a photo,
[02:07:49] shoot or something. And so he was all starving and I took him over there and, um, yeah, there's no
[02:07:56] tonight. So when you, you said to me, hey, I'm going to go out for dinner with Dave Burka. Can you go?
[02:08:02] And I was like, it's, you know, depends. You know, so I said, possible. Yeah. And I actually knew
[02:08:07] that it was probably not possible, but then I thought, well, if they're going to fills
[02:08:12] and I get done training and I can go over there and get, get it done in 35 to 40 minutes,
[02:08:22] I was thinking maybe I'll just go for it. You make time for fills. Yeah. Well, it's a,
[02:08:26] wouldn't you, the net loss because it's going to take me, it's going to take me, you know,
[02:08:30] 17 minutes to eat anyways, right? Yeah. So the net loss is like probably what, what,
[02:08:36] what, around 15 minutes total. We could have ordered for you. So I was ready to roll right in there.
[02:08:41] It would have been a game changer. Yeah. So now we're talking like a 12 minute scenario.
[02:08:47] So I get in and Dave Burk calls me and he says, oh, hey, you know, the, the wife and kids
[02:08:54] Whitney and the kids that really want to see you, too. I'm like, okay, yeah, that's fair. So
[02:08:58] bring them to fills. Yeah. Yeah. He said, once you come over to our house,
[02:09:03] like, oh, okay, yeah, that, that, that's not where I, he said he was moving to San Diego. He didn't say,
[02:09:08] so I was like, oh, I'll probably just be a couple of minutes away. Yeah. Like, okay, maybe
[02:09:12] Jocca, okay, so come to that. We'll still have a good time. He was like, all right, cool. Maybe you can jump
[02:09:16] into it. And he said, come on up and I look in the address that he gives me, it's 45 minutes away.
[02:09:23] And I'm like, can you still come and drag was like, nope.
[02:09:25] No, like, when you go in for dinner, I'm praying that it's going to say fills, be new,
[02:09:32] cute. But it says Dave was nice enough to invite us over to San Diego. Nope.
[02:09:40] Have a good dinner. That's a juicer. Do you Uber up there? Yeah, Uber up there. And then Uber home?
[02:09:45] Hey. Yeah. Um, you're getting a whole new slew of donations just to cover the Uber
[02:09:51] cost. Well, no, no, no, no, you can't use those funds. You have to, I got to do another speaking
[02:09:59] engagement or something. Yeah. I'm going to have to sell some eggs. Exactly. But to be fair,
[02:10:04] the evening was very pleasant. And obviously Dave's family is great. And his wife made some great
[02:10:10] baked Zidi that we thoroughly enjoyed. So it was a very fun evening. But he did kind of trick me.
[02:10:16] Here's the crazy thing. So Dave, the chairs all fired up, you know, and I'm fired up because Dave's
[02:10:21] like, one of the best people ever. And he's moving out San Diego, you know, and it's I'm super stoked.
[02:10:26] And then the Carl's bad word comes in. We're a little bit, you know, we're not quite, you know.
[02:10:31] But here's the funny thing. You know, how many times have seen Dave since he moved out here? Like
[02:10:37] three times. I'm not even kidding because he's on the road all the time working. I'm on the road all the time
[02:10:43] working. So it's cool. We've seen each other three times. But, you know, it's not that cool.
[02:10:51] Hopefully you'll improve over time. Yeah. Yeah. So those are pretty good beefs. Any other other beefs
[02:10:55] with me? The beef is squash. You want to hear something weird? Like when you tell me you have beef with me,
[02:11:00] I'm not kidding. Why are you telling me serious? No, no, no, no, but like I was like, okay,
[02:11:05] like, I mean, I got into a. Yeah, you're in the pocket. I was like, you're in the pocket.
[02:11:11] Okay. Hopefully I have this. Yeah, they're one over here. Did you see MazdaVal after his fight?
[02:11:17] And someone's like, you know, you have beef with this guy? He goes, he goes, no, no, no,
[02:11:20] I don't have beef. If I be for the might be waiting for him outside of his house.
[02:11:23] Yeah, that was legit. MazdaVal is fighting. May deas.
[02:11:31] But I thought that was legit when he says, no, I don't have beef. No, if we had beef,
[02:11:36] I would be waiting outside of his house. That's what would be happening. So you and I don't have beef.
[02:11:42] No. Well, that was just a funny thing. Because when you said we had beef, I was like,
[02:11:46] oh, we're getting into the knife. Chopin triggered. You saw.
[02:11:50] Oh, that's all my comments. No, we can get those are good beefs. Those are good. Good comments.
[02:11:58] We're going to do some research about Joko, the plaster lantern holder. I'm not sure.
[02:12:04] What do you think? You think it's urban legend or real? Do you think there was a little
[02:12:10] black kid holding the lantern for George Washington that froze to death? Yes or no?
[02:12:14] Factor fiction. Yes. Oh, you're going with it. Yeah. Well, put it this way. It might not be exactly that.
[02:12:24] But I think it's like something. But it's not nothing. Put it that way. It's not just,
[02:12:28] oh, someone made up. That's what I think. He's thinking. I don't know. That's a free time.
[02:12:31] You know what? That's a free time. I have actually, I actually know this.
[02:12:37] And I cannot remember. Like I can't remember, it's true. No, because it's so pointy. No, I was like,
[02:12:41] no, I'm like at some point, I, I somebody told me that these little statues were called
[02:12:45] Joko and I was like, oh, I wonder why that is? And I figured out where it came from.
[02:12:50] But I can't remember what the story is. So it could be true. It could be not be true. I don't know yet.
[02:12:54] That's just what I heard. We're going to research it. Yeah. And I would, so I wouldn't be surprised
[02:12:58] most likely case scenario in my head right now is that that story overall is true. Maybe some
[02:13:03] details here and there maybe maybe not true. You know, and it all sort of ties in. Yes. So we'll go with it
[02:13:09] in that regard. Oh, yes. Well, that was just one of the Vegas. Yes. It was a very good one.
[02:13:14] But it's not just, it's not just like, oh, here's a statue that means something else.
[02:13:19] You know, some other thing. But this will sound good if we make up this story. You know, based on
[02:13:24] really like some thinly veiled like element that changed what concerns me. I think if it was that
[02:13:31] story that I had read when I researched it in the past, it seems like that would make the connection
[02:13:37] in my neurons and I'd be like, oh, yeah, that's true. Not quite there. You know, feeling not
[02:13:42] not feeling that full. I remember, but I, you know, you're you're subject to your power of your
[02:13:48] memory. Yeah. It was a while ago that I researched that. Yeah. But I do. Yes. Okay. So we got beefs
[02:13:55] settled. We got Dave Burke. Close. Still, you know, we're working through it. Yeah. Dave Burke.
[02:14:04] No, maybe when he's, yeah, because you know how lame I am. Yeah. When you call me and you're like,
[02:14:11] hey, you know, the fights are on, you want to come watch the fights? And you live 17 minutes from me?
[02:14:18] I'm like, oh, I'll buy this. Not watching. Yeah. It's like big thing. Yeah. Yes. So yeah, when you're
[02:14:26] thinking 45. Yeah. It's a strategy. Min, yeah. Halfway to LA, let's face it. Time wise to halfway to LA.
[02:14:34] Absolutely. That's what it's like. Oh, yeah. You know what? It's a really harsh way. If you want to
[02:14:39] think that we really are really like that. To say, oh, you only live halfway to LA. I mean, it's
[02:14:44] like, there was an old Saturday night live, skit. That was just California people talking and
[02:14:52] all they were talking about was the traffic. Like, oh, morning, how was the 405 this morning?
[02:14:57] Oh, my God. It was a nightmare. And then the, you know, they just talked that was about the
[02:15:01] video. Yeah. You want the one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was one, I was one, I was one, I was one, I
[02:15:04] won a one. Got jammed up right around the, you know, exit 48. Oh, I'm glad I got it. You know,
[02:15:09] like that. Yeah. And here you are. Halfway to LA. Can't even go with the 50 miles of LA.
[02:15:16] Yeah, no, no. Yeah. All right. The struggles real. But hey, like, like, like, you, like, we all
[02:15:22] understand now we're powering through it. Not much talk about Gitu. This podcast. In its
[02:15:28] direct form. In its indirect form. It was everywhere. The spirit of Gitu is everywhere. Yes.
[02:15:36] Was that the last time that we, you came here that we trained? First time. That was the first time.
[02:15:40] Yeah. Did you like it? Yeah, I did. Yeah. It's good. I actually have Gitu, Ligs,
[02:15:49] made. So now that I'm in the my new schedule. I've, I've gone and taken a couple of Filipino
[02:15:53] colleague lessons. I was taking those when I was living in Salt Lake City. So now I'm making
[02:15:57] the transition to finding, you know, the, the scheduling time where I can go and find a good
[02:16:02] place to go and start using my Gitu. I like it. Put like hooks on those Gitu legs. Yeah. Like
[02:16:10] butterfly hook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Well, he's so being on the path
[02:16:17] supporting others and ourselves. We're doing Gitu. Highly recommended required. We'll say
[02:16:23] required already. And let's go with it. Yeah. I'm going with it. We're going to get an origin
[02:16:32] G made in America. 100% in America. The cotton that's grown to make the fibers to make the material
[02:16:39] to make the geek. Mm-hmm. It's a weave to make the geek. All that. All that.
[02:16:43] This is different weeks. 100% made in America. No compromise. No compromise. You know how much
[02:16:48] compromise? None zero. Yeah. Yeah. You're a compromise. 100% no compromise. Boom.
[02:16:54] Uh, origin main.com. That's where you can get your geek. Various levels of G's. I don't even know
[02:16:59] if their levels will just say options. Is there's not like ones not necessarily better? They're just
[02:17:04] that's all matter of opinion. It's like when you you might like you might like this Cadillac
[02:17:10] or you might like that Cadillac. Cadillac. They're both good cars. Yeah. 100% yes. But you might want
[02:17:16] one for certain reasons. That's a bit of another one. Yeah. You're a lifestyle. Yeah. You're
[02:17:22] so. But you cannot only get G's. They're because unfortunately not everyone does
[02:17:29] train G's to and unfortunately G's are not fully accepted as the garment to be worn in all
[02:17:37] occasions at all times. Yeah. We still have to wear other clothes sometimes. And one of those
[02:17:41] clothes that we sometimes wear most often is something called jeans. Yes, sir. And origin makes
[02:17:47] jeans. American denim. Same deal. Same thing. Same thing. From the time that the Adams
[02:17:55] that formed that girl. Right? That Adams are American. Yeah. I don't know if Adams grow. Well,
[02:18:02] you know, they they've formed a girl. Right? And they have little American flags on those
[02:18:06] evidence. Because that's what we do. You're right. Exactly. And so yes, we're talking about patriotism,
[02:18:14] Rob's a patriot, Rob's serving. Guess what we're doing. What we're doing is trying to bring
[02:18:19] manufacturing back to America. We just hired more people by the way. We got more people
[02:18:25] up at the factory up in Maine because we're making boots now because Americans need boots. They
[02:18:30] need jeans. So yeah, if you want to support the United States of America, if you want to bring us
[02:18:38] back to the leaders of manufacturing, go to originmane.com, get jeans, get keys, get rash guards,
[02:18:45] get t-shirts, get joggers. If you are a jogger person, if you're that is a good, uh, obviously
[02:18:54] very significant important disclaimer. Yes, because I'm not a jogger person. Yeah, you're not a lot
[02:19:00] to our noggers. I look really weird in joggers. Yeah. So don't don't get those if you're me. Yeah.
[02:19:07] But if you're interested in maximum comfort and functionality to list be honest, joggers,
[02:19:13] when you actually jog in them, which I have like twice, you, they function well. They don't fly around.
[02:19:20] Never, ever, ever jog in a pair of pants, ever. Yeah. Yeah. Like no matter what.
[02:19:29] So, you know, not everyone's like that. Okay. You know. But yeah, also supplements, right?
[02:19:34] Talk about support. This is like actual physical anatomical support. Do you know what holds
[02:19:41] to see? The whole deal. Building the fibers that support building the atoms. Yeah, we
[02:19:46] add them to that. So we're at a pair of data. Yeah. Or, but well, in this case, it could be not
[02:19:52] a fact. Yeah. Sure. That too. But nonetheless, these are, um, we established the fact that these
[02:20:01] are the most important kind of supplements right there, because they keep you in the game.
[02:20:04] Mm-hmm. Like how we said before, keep you in the game. Yeah. It's not something you're not,
[02:20:07] well, it's like watering the roots rather than watering the leaves. You don't want to leave. No,
[02:20:12] don't want to leave. Unless you do water leaves on it, you don't get any water. The roots. Yes. Exactly.
[02:20:16] Right. So you want those roots to be strong. That's what super,
[02:20:19] Creole oil. Joint warfare. That's what these things do. You want to the roots.
[02:20:25] You grow higher. Also, we got discipline. Yes, sir. Which Dave Burke is a big supporter of.
[02:20:30] He takes discipline. Go capsules. You know, get his brains right. But guess what? You get
[02:20:37] this one in the power out. By the way, Andy Burke has been tripling up his scoops in our
[02:20:42] world with him last night. Again, luckily, that one was non-video. That video actually,
[02:20:50] the one of you in Andy, really, who's like just for like three minutes. What was that like the
[02:20:53] end of the round or something? Yeah. Yeah. Was whatever was left on the round? Yeah. That, that was
[02:20:59] it actually an uncanny, uncannily accurate depiction of rolling with you. It just felt like super heavy.
[02:21:06] And that's that's spazzy. Yeah. You know, just real heavy and just like heavy. Look, we should read the
[02:21:11] comments. We should do a podcast where we just read comments. I know we've talked about that. But that
[02:21:15] has to funny comments. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you talked about political haters. There were some.
[02:21:21] So really funny. They were hating on me. They're hating on Andy. They were hating on
[02:21:25] you. Yeah, too. I mean, most people are super cool. But the funny ones, the ones that would be worse,
[02:21:30] like, comically reading were ones that, you know, people that were just talking smack.
[02:21:35] Yeah. That's how man. Yeah. That's how. Marshall largest is one of those trigger events. You
[02:21:40] know, like, Marshall art diet, raising kids, religions, all at least sleep apparently. Yeah. Like how much
[02:21:46] you do? You're going to actually die. Oh, yeah. It's just in sleep. See if you can speak enough.
[02:21:52] Speaking of discipline, we got new discipline. It's in a can. It's called discipline go. It is
[02:21:58] what I'm going to call clean energy. You know, you got those energy that's that's not clean.
[02:22:06] Oh, yeah. 30 energy. It's called drinks with a bunch of sugar in them and other chemicals.
[02:22:13] This drink has not that in it. Yeah. It's like you, it's clean. And like you can't even call it
[02:22:19] energy. Let me, let me read you the ingredient list. Filtered carbonated water,
[02:22:24] natural flavor, citric acid, monk fruit. Boom. Did you hear that? That's clean. That is it.
[02:22:33] Clean as you can make a drink. And you know why? You know what's revolutionary? What's revolutionary?
[02:22:38] The way we're able to do that is because we are pasteurizing this. Like what they do with milk.
[02:22:42] We are pasteurizing it. We're keeping it to that certain level, killing all the bacteria,
[02:22:46] whatever that's in there. So we can stay on the shelf without putting a bunch of chemicals,
[02:22:50] which whatever else does. So discipline go. We got two flavors right now. We got more common.
[02:22:58] And they're all good. This is my mother. The other one is tropic thunder. Oh, dang.
[02:23:02] I don't think that. And I'll tell you, it's called tropic thunder. And sometimes you know,
[02:23:06] oh, that's cool name, whatever. It was either that or I had to call it what it is. And you
[02:23:10] want to know what it is. Yeah. Pina colance, Pina colance. Let's face it. Yeah, that doesn't match.
[02:23:15] I can't come out with something called Pina colance. No, no. Not happens. So we call the
[02:23:20] tropic thunder. So yeah, you can get that discipline go. Cance all that stuff from origin main.com.
[02:23:27] So milk protein. Yes. Dissert in the or protein form of the dessert. And this work in
[02:23:32] milk protein in the form of dessert for your kid. And a snack. It's like a sweet snack. We'll say
[02:23:36] for the kids, right? Yeah. It's actually an amazing thing. And then what are you? What are you drinking today?
[02:23:42] Oh, my, my little thing now. Yeah. I got some chocolate. And I have never felt more
[02:23:53] mental faculties or just fire. Fire on the other. And you're a tea drinker because your
[02:23:58] wife's from England. Big tea drinker. I'm actually trying to create my own drink. You know,
[02:24:04] how Arnold Palmer. Yeah, you're fan of the all in our Paul. You like to put a little shot of
[02:24:07] lemon. Let me tell you what. I see. We have a little flavor coming out for powdered discipline
[02:24:13] and a flavor coming out for discipline go in the can. And the name of the flavor is
[02:24:20] jaccopommer. And I'm not even kidding. And I'll tell you what, it is the one that both of them.
[02:24:29] They are you like, you like Arnold Palmer's. Yeah. So if you picture the best Arnold Palmer that you
[02:24:34] ever had, that's how good these are. I was like, when I went through whatever eight samples. And
[02:24:42] like, no, no more this more tea less that more. And finally got the when we when I got the good one,
[02:24:46] when I got the final one, I told be little. I'm like, hey, go manufacturer, both these things right now.
[02:24:54] I want this stuff tomorrow. And he's like, it's going to be six weeks a week. Bro,
[02:24:58] I said me more samples. All right, so yes. I'm trying to get my own drink made or not made, but
[02:25:06] I'm going to make it a thing. You know how when the first time I was here, we went and we had ice
[02:25:11] teas and I put a little half an half in there. Little hit or yeah. Yeah. So I kind of got that from
[02:25:17] learning how to drink tea from Pam. So you see, introduced me to the way that English people
[02:25:21] drink tea. They put milk in there. So I came back. I'm American. We like to do the ice tea.
[02:25:27] And I thought I'm thinking outside the box. I'm outside the box. The thing hurts. So I was like,
[02:25:31] you know what? I'm going to have an iced tea and bring a little half in half, too. Poor that in there.
[02:25:36] Delicious. Most people think, little gross. But what I'm going to start doing now, I'm going to start saying,
[02:25:41] I'll have a Rob Jones and the white or be like, oh, you know, I see with half of that. I see what will happen
[02:25:48] in there. I would have been way more supportive of this. If you would have said, oh, so I'm going to
[02:25:53] bring it back a little bit. So I put milk in there vanilla milk because that's face it. That's an option.
[02:25:59] That's an option. I have tried that vanilla. I have tried milk. I've tried protein powders like
[02:26:04] a regular tea. You haven't tried any. Yeah, that's right. That's true. Yeah, it's right. But now you and I have
[02:26:12] at this juncture, it wouldn't be that wise to do the whole thing yet because half and half is going
[02:26:16] to be a little bit more widespread at this point. Yeah. He's trying to step at the role is establishing
[02:26:22] the rob Jones. Yeah. Like the half and half of my own. That's what everybody knows about. Yeah. So
[02:26:28] in a way is kind of up to you, to us, to bolster the availability of milk in a general way.
[02:26:36] To make the milk Jones. Oh, yeah. That's the next level one. Hey, that's a good. Yeah,
[02:26:42] this you know the discipline, the Arnold Palmer flavor, which is called jaccopommer.
[02:26:48] It's so good. It's ridiculous. All right. So that's that. All jaccopoite all mook blah blah blah. Check.
[02:26:59] Origin main.com. Boom. Get it. Yeah. Whatever you need, whatever you like. Also,
[02:27:04] jaccopo has a store. It's called jaccopo store. Yep. So online store. Yeah. If you want to represent
[02:27:10] you go jaccopostore.com, as we can get your deaf course shirts. Come on, let's face it. When you see someone
[02:27:17] representing that. It's good. But yeah, you can get this when he goes free. It's on T-shirt.
[02:27:24] It's hoodies. Lightweight and heavyweight hoodies. But I don't know.
[02:27:28] Trucker hat or Flex fit rub Jones. What is a Flex fit? It's the one that fits in Flex. Oh,
[02:27:36] like the fitted caps. Yeah. Well, no, no, they're fitted. But they they have a little
[02:27:41] asses stretch in there. So you know, yeah. Trucker's bro. Yeah. I have to go to truckers.
[02:27:48] But not by a white margin, apparently. Well, you know, there's certain instances where the
[02:27:54] the Flex might be better. Right. You're out. You're thinking about it. Let's do a work it now.
[02:27:58] If you're outside, you're going to be sweating a lot. I don't know. But we're not against Flex fit.
[02:28:03] I like both. Yeah. But if I had to choose one. That was a very political answer.
[02:28:08] I'm just kidding. I'm just a conversation. I didn't take one. But here's the thing.
[02:28:13] The rest of my life I go trucker. There we go. Thank you. Okay. I'm afraid.
[02:28:16] Yeah. I don't wear hats. I don't even. I'm just waiting in this debate broke.
[02:28:21] Because when I used to wear hats. What made you stop? I don't know. I think he was like
[02:28:27] your head's in the sun. Yes. And you don't wear hats. I'm sorry. Don't.
[02:28:32] I guess it should because fashion sense. No. No. Because lack of hat.
[02:28:36] Lack of preparation for the hat. It's a scenario. I think about it. I have a hat with me everywhere I go.
[02:28:45] Yeah. I don't wear it all the time because I'm not one of those guys. What guys?
[02:28:52] Guys who have to wear it. I don't think about it. If my head isn't hot, I don't think about it for whatever reason.
[02:28:58] Check. But nonetheless. Okay. We got both. That's the good news, Rob Jones. We have both.
[02:29:04] Okay. Let's see. You get a good thing here on the stage. Yes, sir. Yep. You're good.
[02:29:08] This is the one. You are 100% wrong. And I am 100% right. Oh, that's a better. God.
[02:29:15] And if you don't like truckers hat, you're evil. Yes. It's not. You are not.
[02:29:20] Amen. You're a communist. Jockelstore.com. Yes. For you communist or otherwise, you know,
[02:29:27] whatever. No, no, no communist. No communist allowed. No. Yeah, but communist won't represent like that anyway.
[02:29:32] See, I'm saying, so they're just going to do your gun on what he called. They're going to scroll. Yeah.
[02:29:35] That's cool. Don't forget to subscribe to this podcast, which apparently you haven't done yet.
[02:29:40] According to your echoed Charles, you've listened to 100.
[02:29:44] And they're all said that. You would have a podcast. And you didn't subscribe according to echoed
[02:29:49] Charles. So he says, you should subscribe. If you want. If you want them there. So it's like,
[02:29:56] so that means you don't have to. You don't have to. You don't have to. Yeah. You don't have to. It's all optional. Really at the end of the day.
[02:30:02] Also, where he kid bought cast, subscribe to that one. Mm-hmm. My daughter has a question for Uncle Jake,
[02:30:08] by the way. There's a whole last night that Uncle Jake recommended strongly that she just
[02:30:14] call him on FaceTime or whatever, since she has the direct glance. She felt real good. I sat her video
[02:30:18] today, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. She sent me a video first. Okay. From Sarah Charles's. Okay, cool.
[02:30:24] So she's bringing away the warrior kid to school. Yeah. Show and tell. Yes. She's nice. She sent me a little video.
[02:30:30] I'm bringing this book into school. Thank you. Yeah. And then she was telling me a little bit about the book.
[02:30:35] And then I said, hey, because she said, she said, there's even a picture of you on the back.
[02:30:39] And I informed her that her dad took that picture. Echo Charles. That's really the kind of meat of that book.
[02:30:44] Is that that photograph that you took? That's what I thought a lot of people. And I guess there's some cool lessons or whatever.
[02:30:50] But yes, you are right. That picture. Yeah. Warrior Kid podcast. We are in the process of recording
[02:30:54] couple right now, which is good. I have a story in my brain for the Uncle Jake story. So we're
[02:30:58] getting there. So warrior Kid podcast, subscribe to that. And also don't forget about warrior
[02:31:02] kids soap. We got aiden up in central California speaking of farming, lives on a farm.
[02:31:09] And soap. It's awesome. It is. It is very much so. Totally legit. So go to IrishOx Ranch.com.
[02:31:16] And that way you can stay clean. Also, YouTube channel. We do have a YouTube channel,
[02:31:24] officially. A Rob Jones has a Rob Jones for Congress, YouTube channels. Well, I do want to forget about that.
[02:31:30] Because you written some cool videos up there. That's another way to see what you put.
[02:31:33] Or like what kind of videos so far. Only one of those no exposure. No exposure. No
[02:31:38] exposure. Don't worry. We'll talk about that. Well, there is a real life explosion.
[02:31:41] You do have a real life. You have the actual explosion that you set off? No, no, no. I was going to say,
[02:31:47] well, we set it up and it was so controlled that there was a control button. I stopped on
[02:31:51] really. Yeah. People really, people really, they're cameras out during those shows.
[02:31:55] Which weird though. There's people that have footage of everything. Like some of the
[02:32:00] guys put cameras on the rifle. Yeah, cameras on the rifles on their helmet. There's videos of
[02:32:04] everything out. When we had Ron Scher on here who they like assaulted this hill and
[02:32:13] he's a metal of honor recipient, that almost the whole thing is on video. It's on YouTube.
[02:32:18] You can watch it. It's like, and you watch it. And as bad as it sounds when you read about it,
[02:32:24] as bad as the situation sounds when you read about it, you're like, I'm thinking myself, man,
[02:32:27] this sounds absolutely horrible. You watch the video and you go, oh my god. I mean, I was laughing
[02:32:34] about it with them. Because the guys get out in the valley, it's not even a valley. It's just,
[02:32:40] it's a ravine. No, it's a canyon. They get out at the bottom of the canyon and assault
[02:32:47] up a hill, a freaking giant reinforced castle. It's like out of a prehist or a medieval movie.
[02:32:56] And that's what they did. And they didn't make it all the way up because it was an impossible task.
[02:33:00] But yeah, so there is a video. That's why when you said, oh, there's exposure. And I remember
[02:33:04] to watch that video yesterday. But yeah, not the exposure. Yeah, not the the exposure. No. But
[02:33:09] what, um, as far as like videos or whatever, like I'm going to subscribe, smash the like button,
[02:33:13] all that stuff. What, uh, what am I going to be watching? Um, here you're going to be watching stuff
[02:33:18] like that. You're going to, mostly the videos that we're going to be doing is just getting people to
[02:33:24] know who I am, what I'm about. So there might be some personal stuff on there where I'm going
[02:33:28] around the district and kind of talking about, oh, you know, this is where I went to elementary school.
[02:33:34] This is where I used to go hiking on the Appalachian Trail, you know, stuff like that. So just
[02:33:37] getting people to know what I'm all about as a person. So yeah, there's going to be a lot of that
[02:33:42] stuff. If you need footage from the podcast, you could take little clips of your statements and
[02:33:48] stuff, let echo know. You know, and then you could, you could edit some of those. Yeah, well, yeah,
[02:33:54] stuff like that. But yes, we do have our YouTube channel, talk podcast YouTube channel. It
[02:33:59] interested in what Rob Jones looks like if you don't know already, which I think is going to be
[02:34:04] sorely disappointed if you want to know. Man, and then there's psychological warfare. It's a bunch of
[02:34:10] me in little short recordings about how the decision that you're about to make, which is the wrong
[02:34:16] decision that you know, and you need a little something to get you to make the right decision
[02:34:20] psychological warfare will get it done for you, just press play on your smartphone device device
[02:34:30] and you will literally make the right decision. Yeah, what that does really, and I know literally
[02:34:36] is overused, but I'm saying you will for really literally make the right decision. It makes sense
[02:34:42] because it's you talking about them almost making the short term thing that we covered on
[02:34:48] machete season. When the first thing the when a revolution happens, they take over the radio stations
[02:34:54] because they want to get right into the thoughts of the people. Right? No, you don't have to read it.
[02:35:00] You don't have to interpret anything. It's going into your brain. It's words. That's a psychological
[02:35:04] warfare. It's going to write into your brain. Yeah, but your words are saying, hey, right now you're
[02:35:08] about to make a short term play. Let's just shuffle that over to the long term. That's all we're
[02:35:14] going to do. We're going to make that decision. But instead of short term, we're going to go long
[02:35:17] term. That's all we're going to do right now. And then you go, oh, shit. And well, that's what we're going
[02:35:20] to do. And then you go do it. That's what it does. Yeah. Effectively, by the way. Yeah, yeah, so you can do that.
[02:35:26] You can put a cure of the dot. You're ever heard a cure of the dawn. A cure of the dawn, yeah.
[02:35:31] Yeah, yeah. Because you could just listen to a cure of the dawn tracks. Sure. Eight minute tracks.
[02:35:36] What's a music in the background? What did it just be talking? Yes. Is that weird? No, people know that.
[02:35:44] Yeah, I dig it. I like music in the back of talking. I like that. Oh, yeah. Well, that's what the
[02:35:49] good video is. And people love that. It's all new. Yeah. Yeah. True. Good music there. A lot of people think
[02:35:55] it's maybe what's get said. But then so most people think it's just a video. That's that made
[02:36:00] that video cool. That's where you've told me a lot. Yeah, I'm one of those people. But you know,
[02:36:04] hey, different people. What's all of that. If you want visual reminders of saying on the path

[02:37:34] Sure. Yes. Maybe even over six sometimes. Yeah, sometimes over six. Because those things you
[02:37:38] forget about that can stuff. You seem saying and it's kind of obvious like being like afraid of something
[02:37:44] then you say then somebody will be like, hey, what are you really afraid of the thing about what I'm
[02:37:49] really afraid of just feels scary. Whatever we had a little incident at the Willink Household two days ago.
[02:37:57] It was time to go for an ocean swim with my youngest daughter. There was a tied scenario that was
[02:38:03] making it the only water entry was a little cliff jump. And my daughter, my daughter,
[02:38:13] was hesitant at the moment of truth. How high? Not high at all depends on where the waves were at
[02:38:18] and you had to time it well. And there's a lot of, let's say, white water activity in the zone,
[02:38:23] which raised the fear of love. Yes. In fact, I asked her, what are you afraid of? And she's like,
[02:38:26] it looks like it's crazy. Yeah, but we had a little talk and then I threw it in.
[02:38:33] I did. I got to admit, you know, but was it like the kind of surprise throw you in or it's like,
[02:38:39] hey, don't worry. You have to make the decision. I gave her, I gave her time to think about it. But
[02:38:42] actually part of the reason that I gave her time to think about it was I wanted her to experience
[02:38:48] the fear for a longer amount of time, right? Not just like, no, we got to do it right now. Let's go.
[02:38:51] I wanted her to stand there and think about it because that's actually the worst part. Yes. And so then
[02:38:55] finally, I said, Liz and I said, she's like, I really don't want to. It really looks, it looks like
[02:38:59] it could be really dangerous. It looks like I'm going to get sucked in those rocks and I said,
[02:39:02] you're not going to get sucked in the rocks. You're going to be fine. And just so you know,
[02:39:08] you are going to do this. So we can wait as long as you want, but this is happening. And when my
[02:39:13] kids know me, like when I say that, it's not there's no like this, it's going to happen. And so I said that to her
[02:39:20] and she kind of got the defeated look on her face because she knew it was going to happen. And the
[02:39:26] the because her tears were like up a little bit. They didn't come out, but I could see it. And my
[02:39:33] youngest daughter, she got these big, big blue eyes and she's real good with that whole play.
[02:39:38] Oh, yeah, she's good. She, my wife, she would break my wife down like a child. I'm going to just snap her
[02:39:46] more out. No chance. No chance. No chance. No chance. When those, she got those big eyes that it can
[02:39:52] it can hold the tear. It can just hold it there. Which is even worse right now. Yes, they're big.
[02:39:58] And so she started doing that with me. Guess what? I don't play that.
[02:40:02] Those tears in the industry, we call those tears falling upon a heart of stone. Yes, that's
[02:40:07] what happened. So she started to get work in that angle. I said, don't even, don't work that
[02:40:12] angle. It's happening. We're going off this cliff. So we get so finally, she's, she looks defeated.
[02:40:19] She knows it's happening. She walks the edge and I said, okay, and it was kind of a tight little
[02:40:23] promenadeary to try and jump off just a little thing jutting out. It's actually not big enough for
[02:40:28] two people. So I kind of put her a little bit in front of me. And then I said, okay, we're going to go on
[02:40:34] three and I knew I couldn't actually go with her because there's rocks down there. You got to watch
[02:40:37] out for so that I just kind of, I go, okay, one, two scooped up grab her through.
[02:40:47] You laughed like that. She was going down. You know, the best thing is she hit the water.
[02:40:53] She started swimming away from the rocks so she could be safe. And then I got a watchter and then
[02:40:59] then she looked up and she had a big smile on her face. She got to her. It's fun. Yeah, she's
[02:41:02] over and then we swam, you know, whatever to back all around the point to the, to the, to the beach.
[02:41:07] Well, that's good though. And I told her, I said, look, that's what that was. That was
[02:41:11] Mike and the dragons. That was, that was, you stood up and faced your fears. That was jumping off
[02:41:15] the bridge from Mark where the warrior kid you just did it. That's what it's about. But in
[02:41:20] when you look at a big picture, like that's a specific scenario where you knew her like capability
[02:41:25] and limitations or whatever because sometimes like you get someone maybe not comfortable in the water
[02:41:29] or something like this. Oh, yeah, that's when you throw them in. Oh, yeah, they're not looking
[02:41:33] back smiling. They are traumatized. And now they can't go in the water at all anymore. You know,
[02:41:38] yeah, I kind of did that with one of my friends kids. No, like the dad is a good friend of mine.
[02:41:45] He was on the ployment. You're not invited to my house. You know, he was on the ployment. Check it out.
[02:41:48] He was on the ployment. And so while he's on the ployment, who guess who's responsible for like making
[02:41:53] sure that the sun is kind of like, you know, legit. It's me. And I didn't get to see him that much because
[02:41:58] I was like working and deploying it all that stuff. So I finally saw him at the beach and I was like,
[02:42:02] cool, we're going in the water. And he's like, I don't really want to go in there. I was like, oh,
[02:42:05] what? And I just picked him up and I hooked him out in the surf zone. He wasn't happy. The mama's crying.
[02:42:13] And I thought she was a cry. And when she definitely was like, you know, how you know,
[02:42:17] sometimes things are unfolding and you can tell people they're just doing their best just to like
[02:42:24] detach from it. Yes. She was in that mood. She's a good friend of mine. She was kind of like,
[02:42:28] look, I know this guy's probably this is probably not right. But he handled or was he like,
[02:42:36] I don't know if I can even hang with chocolate anymore. It was probably not the best.
[02:42:40] Yeah. Yeah. It was probably not the best move on my part. I also did that one time with a real little kid
[02:42:46] where I picked this little kid up. And I said, you know, something was a boy, right? And I said something
[02:42:52] like, oh, there he is. And it's really, oh, yeah. It's like, oh, it's like, oh, it's in acute. I was like, yeah.
[02:42:56] And he needs to get used to, you know, things like machine gun fire. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[02:42:59] like really loud. And the kids started crying because this kid was like six months old or maybe even a little bit
[02:43:04] younger. Six months. So baby. Yeah. So yeah. So be careful that. Well, hey, so hi, so you
[02:43:12] essentially, and I'm trying to gather like info, so I can actually use in the real work. So you kind of,
[02:43:17] you're like on the on the what he call it on the borderline of two rough. Right. Yes. No, and I'm better now.
[02:43:25] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not to just totally go into like one more little situation. I was
[02:43:32] surfing with my little daughter, same one, right? And it was, we were done. And there's a cliff
[02:43:39] you got to climb up to get out. We're carrying your board. It's a cliff. It's a trail. It's a whole nine yards.
[02:43:44] And so what I did was, she's 10 years old. So I, and it's can be hard. And there's a little parts
[02:43:51] where you could possibly fall off, right? Probably not though. Most likely you're going to be good. If you
[02:43:57] think about what you're doing. So I get done and I got my board. So I run up to the top of
[02:44:02] cliff's carrying my board. I put it down and I turned around so I can go help her carry her board for
[02:44:06] her. Yeah. And I fought to myself if this was my son when my son was that age, there was zero
[02:44:13] chance of me going down and helping him. Zero. You figured out kid. And so I stood there at the top
[02:44:21] and I just watched her and she made it up and when she got to the top, I said, you know, I was going
[02:44:26] to come help you. I said, but if that was your brother, there's no way I would have ever helped him.
[02:44:31] And I don't, I would rather have you do it for yourself. What do you want me to do? Do you want
[02:44:36] me to give you special treatment? Or do you want to be strong? And she's like, I want to be strong.
[02:44:40] And I said, cool, we're good. So there you go. You can have a tendency to lean especially when you
[02:44:48] you got your baby kid, right? The youngest kid, especially when they can make those tears think
[02:44:52] that big giant tears sitting on the edge of the eyeballs. That's it. But that's how you do run
[02:44:58] that risk though of going like touch, you know, sticking one toe over the board. You can definitely
[02:45:03] make it more kid-cross. You can traumatize the kid. You can make them hate the water. There's
[02:45:06] a lot of things you can do. So you got to be careful. You got to lean towards and actually the best
[02:45:10] policy is you lean towards whatever you do with them builds their confidence doesn't break it.
[02:45:14] That's the, that's the line. You say, oh, if I throw them in the water and they get, they get
[02:45:18] done with it in the car. I actually did it. That builds their confidence cool. If you throw them in the
[02:45:22] water and now it freaks them out and you broke their confidence, that's bad. So the line that you
[02:45:27] should be going for is everything that you're doing with your kids builds their confidence until
[02:45:30] they become overconfident. And then we have to start putting them in check. That's when you take them
[02:45:34] for the pool competency. All right. Yeah, I did that with my son. I did that with my son. Like,
[02:45:42] oh, you're good. Okay, cool. I tied his feet, tied his feet together, tied his hands behind his back.
[02:45:46] And I had him do, uh, we call it drown proofing. And the first time he did it, he did not pass.
[02:45:51] What age is this? I don't know, he's probably like seven.
[02:45:54] Oh, damn. All right. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's for seven. He's good now. But, you know,
[02:45:58] the first time I had to, I had to go for the right little rescue. Right. And that's that thing that you say,
[02:46:03] too, right, where you're like, hey, put them in the right, if they're like in a leadership situation at
[02:46:07] work or whatever, right, like you're like, hey, if they're overconfident, give them something just
[02:46:11] beyond their level. And they're underconfident, not going to give them something. That's what this is when
[02:46:15] my son was like starting to get into big waves. And you know, you can start if you start getting
[02:46:20] overconfident with the ocean, the ocean's going to put in the check. So you don't want to let that happen.
[02:46:26] All right, back to what we're doing here. Discipline goes freedom field manual. That's available as well.
[02:46:30] It's how you stay on the path as an adult or as a kid, not the kids are reading that book as well.
[02:46:37] The audio version is on iTunes Amazon, the music and Google Play as an MP3 album with tracks.
[02:46:44] And then finally, we got extreme ownership in the economy of leadership.
[02:46:47] Books about leadership that we experienced in combat. That Rob Jones is going to bring those principles
[02:46:54] to the government, which is outstanding. How many tweets do I get in the day that says about
[02:47:04] whatever politician on either side that says this guy could use your book, these people can
[02:47:08] use your book. They said all the time, send them to Congress. They say, I would say, well, send them.
[02:47:13] Give me an address. Excellent. That's our leadership consultancy. We saw problems through leadership.
[02:47:18] Go to echelonfront.com for details. We got EF online, which is leadership training that you can do
[02:47:27] virtually. It's interactive. There's choose your own adventures decision-making drills in there.
[02:47:34] Four leaders go to EF online.com to check that out. We got the master. The next one is in Sydney.
[02:47:41] Sydney, December 4th and 5th, we will be there. Who knows when we'll be back in Australia.
[02:47:48] In America, the 20-20 dates will be out soon. So go to extremotorship.com to pay attention to that.
[02:47:56] And don't forget that all masters have sold out. And all masters will sell out.
[02:48:02] So we actually rearrange the room in Denver because it sold out so fast. We like needed. We bought
[02:48:09] more space and made got more seats. But we can't do that every time we max it out. So if you want to come
[02:48:16] good extremotorship.com and then EF Overwatch where we are taking proven leaders. I've got some
[02:48:21] really good talking to Mike Surreli. We got some candidates now that we're not candidates, but we got
[02:48:27] some people that were hired. And that it'll just give the best experience. But we're getting the
[02:48:32] best referrals and feedback on the folks that we're placing. These are special operations in combat,
[02:48:38] aviation leaders that are coming off the battlefield and going into civilian companies and
[02:48:45] helping them with their leadership and helping them win.
[02:48:49] Communication. It's important. We talked about that a decent amount today. If you want to communicate
[02:48:54] with us, then you can find us on the inner webs, on Twitter, Instagram, and on Diva, Fruz, and Book.
[02:49:01] Echoes at Echo Charles. I am at jockwillink. Rob Jones. Okay. So Rob Jones for Congress.com.
[02:49:08] Yep. Facebook is at Rob Jones for Congress. Twitter is at Rob Jones VA. Right. As in Virginia.
[02:49:18] Right. Correct. It was OPPVA in Ramadi. And it was OPPVA. It was Virginia.
[02:49:26] Okay. But you could have thought it was the VA. Yeah. Exactly. I wanted to make it Rob Jones
[02:49:32] for Congress, but they don't allow it to be that long for Twitter. So we had to shorten it. Got it.
[02:49:37] Instagram Rob Jones for Congress. YouTube Rob Jones for Congress. Echo. Anything else?
[02:49:42] Thank you. Rob Jones for coming again. Rob. Any final thoughts? Yeah. You know, I've been lucky enough.
[02:49:48] There have been kind of three main influences in my life. External influences. Marine Corps.
[02:49:58] Jim Jones, which maybe we can talk about some day as well. I had a big impact me at the right time.
[02:50:05] Finally, you know, tree ownership, jacco, echo, the podcast and everything. And I've been lucky enough
[02:50:13] to not only interact with all three of those. Become a part of all three of those. Befriend all three
[02:50:21] of those. You know, I'm just, I just remain incredibly grateful that I've had these opportunities.
[02:50:28] So thanks for having me on again. Looking forward to the next time already. Well, as you can imagine,
[02:50:34] the doors always open anytime you want to come on. You know, just knowing you here in your story
[02:50:39] getting to see the way that you're operating out in the world, I throw that out there. Oh,
[02:50:45] he's an inspiration. You're an inspiration, bro. I mean, the fact of what you've done,
[02:50:49] what you continue to do, it's awesome. And it's awesome. You might think it's cool to be here.
[02:50:55] It's even cooler for us for me to have you here and hang out and get to talk to you and hang out with
[02:51:02] you. So thank you for coming back. More important. Thanks for the service and sacrifice that you've made
[02:51:09] for our country and that you continue to make and what you're going to make in the future. You are
[02:51:17] a leader. You are a warrior and thank you. And to the rest of our warriors out there that are
[02:51:25] face to face with the forces of darkness in the world. Thanks to you all and to your families
[02:51:34] for your service and your sacrifice. And here at home, thanks to our police and our law enforcement
[02:51:39] and our firefighters and our paramedics and our EMTs and our dispatchers and our correctional officers
[02:51:45] and our Border Patrol and our ICE agents and our Secret Service and all the first responders out there.
[02:51:52] Thank you for protecting us here at home. And everyone else that's out there,
[02:52:00] if you think you've kind of, you think you've kind of maxed out on what you can do.
[02:52:06] If you think maybe it's time to back off the gas pedal a little bit and relax.
[02:52:16] If you think you've given everything that you can give right now, well, while you're thinking
[02:52:22] that, once you just take a moment and think about Rob Jones, think about Rob Jones, who's still
[02:52:30] going, who's still going strong despite everything that life has thrown his way. He's still going
[02:52:38] no matter what he gets up and he gets after it. And I recommend that you all do the same.
[02:52:46] And until next time, this is Rob Jones, Aneko and Jocco out.
