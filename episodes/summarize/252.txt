okay these are all things if you aim these things at yourself it is a powerful thing to think about knowledge to detect and courage to correct errors in subordinates initiative does he perform well without close supervision appearance military courtesy and neatness this makes me happy that I wrote the warrior kid books maintenance of equipment individual and organizational attitude loyalty enthusiasm ability as an instructor ability as an instructor and I'll tell you what I've been thinking about and there's a couple of the things that we'll clue in on this we've been talking we've been developing leadership certification program at echelom front and one of the things that we've been dancing around is the fact that there's there's maybe well we we were dancing around with like two different pipelines like you're either a trainer that's going to train people how to lead or your leader and you're in a supervisor position and your management position and your leader and then we've kind of got into a point where we say listen these are the same thing and in order to become a good leader you have to be able to teach you have to be able to show people how to do things so it's interesting that he's got ability as an instructor because listen if I'm going to promote you Dave from you know from being in charge of a squad to being in charge of a tune I want you to be able to teach I want you to be able to instruct that is absolutely important and and in a leadership environment i want you to be able to teach the team about leadership. but the only way for me to tell that you're not yourself or not doing the things that I'm used to is I got to be around you just a little bit more and you don't need to track all this stuff every single time you don't need to know the formal piece of it and formal counseling is important but the best tool you've got is actually know them well enough to go something's not right and if you can intercept that on day one rather than day 30 or 60 or 90 not only do you actually help solve that problem that other person recognizes that you know and care about them enough to get involved and being able to do that is really a function of your time more than anything else of being around your people to know them well enough to identify that when they're off the path so it comes down as high management when I talk about planning and I say okay if I give Dave a mission tasking and say okay Dave come up with a plan and how you want to do this if I leave for 12 hours and you were 3 degrees off and you're what you thought you should do versus what I thought you should do I come back 12 hours there's 12 hours of wasted time because you've been going on on the wrong direction and now you're way off course if I go hey Dave here's the here's the mission you need to execute here's the task come up with your you know some connoffs and it's unsap because in the navy you get an evaluation or a fitness report once a year and there's a lot of companies that we work with that do something similar there's that's just not often it's not often enough it's not even close and those periodic evaluations they actually don't even need to be that formal it's really just the core of building relationships is getting to know your people by being out with them the best thing you can do is know your people well enough to be able to recognize when they're going in the wrong direction and if you talk to your people once a year you're not going to know that because you don't even know what their typically like and so if I'm working with you and so when you say something negative it has a big impact because you know sometimes I say that that plan doesn't make any sense and everyone just be well be quiet because they think that you don't like the plan when reality is you're just thinking maybe I could come up with a different plan so you got the overall and I wrote about this in leadership strategy tactics your words have power and impact so remembering that when you give someone some compliments it may have some it has as more significance than you might think efficiency reports I was I was thinking myself when I saw this I was like I you know I'll kind of skip over this who cares you know there we go that's how that was it that took 18s that's the story we tell ourselves like hey I can't come back in 30 minutes because you actually can't you're absolutely right and it's the idea of whatever it seems like I don't have time a you do have time and if you do need to do some mental calculation of that time the ROI in that time is well worth whatever you might miss for that five minute check-in that happens up front and it also shows another person so the earlier I get involved the less force I have to use and my goal is the leaders to use the minimum force required and the longer I wait to use force but worse it's gonna be and if you're out there thinking about the time the the daunting task of spending all that time up front the ROI on your investment of time of front is is it's it's unlimited because if you make that investment up front which seems like a lot of time what you save on the back end of that so from the time manager standpoint It's all the people in his influence and they're looking at you saying this is what Jocca was going to put up with this is the bar that he's going to tolerate and he'll by the way, this affects me personally and just like on the other extreme of getting rid of people way too soon, way too premature that you haven't invested in, keeping the wrong people around in terms of what that does to your leadership capital. well how do I how do I do the best job take my care of my team I get promoted so I have more leverage and more power and I can be positive influence on even more people so getting promoted if you're getting promoted for yourself we don't like that and by the way when I say we I'm talking about the people that work for you if you're getting promoted for yourself they don't like it we don't like that and I say yeah you didn't do that great of a job woo what good is that the barn are the there were started got stolen I have found that unacceptable performance and the resultant bad efficiency reports can often be reduced to a minimum through early effective observation and counseling G what a novel idea when Dave starts screwing up don't wait six months to give the efficiency report say hey Dave it's been three weeks you've been on this project I already see that you're heading the wrong direction let's talk if a commander makes it a practice to observe his men closely and call them in periodically for an evaluation of their performance in terms of strengths and weaknesses he can often correct deficiencies without it becoming necessary to issue an unsatisfactory efficiency report boom it's a tool that you've got that you can use a three part program of and here's the three parts observation and evaluation counseling and guidance of the individual and individual and then further observation to determine the response to the counseling is your key to effective use of the efficiency report then it becomes a tool for improvement rather than merely a reward or punishment for past performance So, if you're running a company right now or if you're in a company right now, it's a good idea to think about putting together some kind of a council where you say, hey, we need to take the best ideas, take the best practices, take the grievances that we have, assemble them together in a logical way to push them up the chain of command because if the, if the boss, you know, has us work and laid every Friday and the boss doesn't know how much that negatively impacts us, how can we expect them to change it? I'm not trying to pile on the idea of like don't acknowledge your people's good work but what matters to somebody doesn't always matter to everybody and you got to actually pay attention what matters and over time the the head nod and keep doing what you're doing dude that's good to go. And this guy that that I worked with in my squadron, by the time that guy came back to be a squadron commander who had been squared away from day one, dudes are running down to headquarters with cases of very like I want to get in this guy's squadron. If you get somebody with a big ego, you know, the command master chief has a big ego or the commanding officer has a big ego and also you got conflict, then you know, all bets are off and we got man. If that's your kind of like, hey, I'm going to show my face and you don't actually get out spend time with them, they're going to see that coming in my way. Yeah you know I had trouble with this because and I still do because you know when you're the boss right well in my mind you know if I say hey Dave good job Because you're going to find yourself in a place where you think nobody is looking, you're going to find yourself in an environment where you think it's okay and who you are is going to come out. oh I will absolutely include this with the advent of enlisted efficiency reports the command so efficiency reports so for in the civilian sector with the suit boiled down to you know unvaluations are performance evaluation for someone the commander now has a new tool which will assist him in gaining the desired motivation from his key enlisted personnel too often the efficiency report becomes the padlock on the barn door after the horse has been stolen what a great way to think about wasting some kind of evaluation format performance evaluation I want you to be able to teach your fire team leaders how to lead and I also want you to be able to teach them how to break down a 240g. I want you to be able to teach us gesagt so the ability to be an instructor is important and it's equally important because when we teach, we learn. My bias was if I could spend a little more time and set up a little less time, if I could get a little more understanding what's going on, then a little less, that was my bias. I think you said it like in the first pages, leave your office and go out and spend time with your people to see what's really going on down there. but you don't really be to I promise in you I promise you everybody sees it so promotion it must be fair buy it the commander can encourage men to develop themselves for permissions for positions of supervision and leadership the commander should consider the following qualifications and attributes when considering a man for promotion so he goes into a list and what I did and what I wrote down here was when I go through this list aim the aim this list at yourself you aim this list at yourself are you promoteable number one reliability number one reliability when when I talk about relationships I use the word relationships I'm really talking about trust and trust if you don't have trust inside of a team all those lost I barely I probably would be able to get you back on course by asking you will not even tell me anything just by saying hey what do you think about what do you think about this area up to the north do you think that's a you think there could be enemy up there that's kind of what the intel says right You know when you start looking at building what you just said, you know, how do you expect the people to act if you haven't given them a good support structure with their family? And look, if you got long-term plans and you want to build a team and you got long-term plans of having a good team around you, start early.
