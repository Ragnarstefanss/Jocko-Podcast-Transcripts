[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 51 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:11] Forgotten.
[00:00:15] The Korean War is often referred to as the forgotten war.
[00:00:23] It's sandwiched between the massive World War II and then on the other side the highly
[00:00:33] controversial and also highly televised and therefore highly remembered Vietnam war.
[00:00:41] So I guess in that middle of that the Korean War somehow gets lost and I guess somehow
[00:00:51] it gets forgotten.
[00:00:53] Obviously we should never forget.
[00:00:58] The war in Korea was brutal and in many ways when you look at the Korean War you see
[00:01:06] the worst parts of these other wars.
[00:01:10] You had the trenches of World War I.
[00:01:14] You had the bitter cold of the eastern front in World War II.
[00:01:19] You have the land mines of the Vietnam War.
[00:01:26] And for the nearly 2 million that served in Korea and the more than 100,000 that were wounded
[00:01:37] we should never forget and we must never forget and for the 36,516 Americans that
[00:01:46] were killed we must always remember.
[00:01:54] Always.
[00:01:55] And remember that for those that died there is nothing else.
[00:02:03] There's nothing else.
[00:02:05] They gave everything.
[00:02:09] They gave for a few meters in between trenches or for a hill or for their brothers and
[00:02:16] arms.
[00:02:17] That's what war does.
[00:02:21] It gives everything to some and it takes everything from others.
[00:02:33] But tonight we begin to take a look at the Korean War through the eyes of James Brady.
[00:02:41] United States Marine Corps in his book The Coldest War.
[00:02:55] What job are you looking for?
[00:02:58] I knew the expected answer and snapped it back.
[00:03:01] Life will pull two and leaders sir.
[00:03:04] The major said that I was a hard charger that they needed hard chargers in the basic
[00:03:09] school in Virginia where they train Marine Lieutenant.
[00:03:12] They ask you every few hours that same question.
[00:03:15] Then they push a format you to write down your first three choices of duty.
[00:03:20] There are several schools of thought about this.
[00:03:23] One hell you should tell the truth.
[00:03:25] Those who subscribe to this odd notion put down communications or tanks or mountain training,
[00:03:31] anything that might delay assignment to a replacement draft and the war.
[00:03:36] Another advised diplomacy.
[00:03:38] A first choice of rifle platoon leader to show your spirit.
[00:03:42] Then what you really hope for.
[00:03:44] Logistics or motor transport.
[00:03:47] A third school felt you should lie brazenly indicating ferocious demand for a rifle platoon
[00:03:55] on grounds that this might impress people and get you made a general's aid.
[00:04:00] Mac Allen achieved something of a name at basic school by stipulating quite honestly
[00:04:05] each time rifle platoon leader rifle platoon leader.
[00:04:12] I didn't worry about it much.
[00:04:14] Not out of fatalism but simply because I believe the Marine Corps discarded all such
[00:04:18] forms without reading and it didn't matter much what you wrote.
[00:04:24] This close to the line I was too embarrassed to give any answer but the one the major
[00:04:29] obviously wanted to hear.
[00:04:31] Splendid said the major.
[00:04:33] We have an opening for a hard charger.
[00:04:35] Second battalion Colonel Gregory's battalion.
[00:04:38] They want hard chargers up there.
[00:04:40] They need them.
[00:04:42] That's where you're going.
[00:04:44] Second battalion short of company grade officers.
[00:04:47] Then sensing curiosity that's what I'm sending both of you.
[00:04:51] You and Alan.
[00:04:52] Hard chargers.
[00:04:57] We're going to hear a little bit about Mac Allen who gives just the most fired up response
[00:05:04] you can give.
[00:05:05] He could ask what job you want the Marine Corps when you're going through the basic
[00:05:07] school and that is rifle platoon leader rifle platoon leader or rifle platoon leader.
[00:05:14] Prior to that evolution, James Brady is actually graduating from his school.
[00:05:22] In 1950, I'll go to the book.
[00:05:25] In June 1950, I graduated and was handed along with my BA a commission in the United
[00:05:30] States Marine Corps reserve a second lieutenant.
[00:05:33] That was clever.
[00:05:34] I remember thinking how nimbly I avoided two years of military drugdry.
[00:05:41] A week or so later, the North Koreans crossed the 38th parallel and the war was on.
[00:05:48] Within a few months my class was mobilized.
[00:05:52] I joined up to dodge the draft and ended up being sent to war.
[00:05:57] People said the worst job you could have was Marine rifle platoon leader.
[00:06:04] Life expectancy was supposed to be very short.
[00:06:08] He thinks he's just avoiding the draft.
[00:06:11] World War II and ended.
[00:06:12] There's nothing going on.
[00:06:13] But I don't really feel like doing two years of service.
[00:06:17] I'm just going to join the reserve, the Marine Corps reserves, and didn't work out that
[00:06:22] way for him.
[00:06:26] Now we get to Korea.
[00:06:27] I'm just going to skip some of the other leading up to Korea.
[00:06:30] They show up at Korea.
[00:06:31] One of the reasons that I've got a bunch of books I'm going to read over the years and one
[00:06:34] of the reasons that this book kind of bubble to the surface because there's a guy
[00:06:39] in it named Captain Chaffey who is going to see just exquisite leadership throughout the
[00:06:47] little things he does.
[00:06:50] It just is worth studying, worth us taking a look at.
[00:06:56] They show up in Korea in this guy, Captain Chaffey.
[00:07:00] He kind of greets him.
[00:07:04] Back to the book, Captain Chaffey, the dog company commander came a few hundred yards
[00:07:07] down the trail to meet the Gook train, shaking hands with Alan and me.
[00:07:12] The Gook train, Gook's a terminal again to a little bit later, it's a term that they use
[00:07:17] for these Koreans that work for them that did all the marching up and down carrying water
[00:07:24] and fuel up and down.
[00:07:26] They call it the Gook train.
[00:07:28] And they also win it's time for new people to get brought up to the front lines.
[00:07:34] They follow up the Gook train.
[00:07:36] So Captain Chaffey comes down and meet him.
[00:07:38] Back to the book.
[00:07:39] I'm very pleased to have you both here.
[00:07:41] I simply wanted to say welcome and get you off to a proper start.
[00:07:45] Chaffey was a road islander.
[00:07:47] One of those old Yankee blue bloods with a high color of large nose and a splendid mustache.
[00:07:53] He was very lean, very dark, a handsome man.
[00:07:57] He didn't seem to have any weapon of any sort.
[00:08:00] Only a kind of alpine stave that he used as he loped.
[00:08:03] His long legs covering the uneven ground in great strides.
[00:08:07] Going uphill he was fast and coming down he nearly ran.
[00:08:11] Later I would learn he was skull and bones at Yale and had a law practice and political ambitions.
[00:08:18] He now took us on a guided tour of the company front.
[00:08:21] So not your typical sort of what you'd expect a Marine Corps company commander to be.
[00:08:28] You know, guys at Yale he's a lawyer and sounds like he comes from some money.
[00:08:34] So kind of different than what you imagine.
[00:08:39] Back to the book we're a trifle under strength at the moment.
[00:08:42] Chaffey told us he didn't sound apologetic or dismayed by this just stating a fact.
[00:08:48] He took off as he talked swinging along the top lip of a shallow trench line that followed
[00:08:52] the ridge, linking large and small bunkers 20 to 50 yards apart.
[00:08:58] As we moved along the length of the company line, Chaffey stopped to talk with each
[00:09:01] Marine at each bunker.
[00:09:04] He called each man by name, not Christian names or nicknames as they do in war movies,
[00:09:09] but the man's proper name.
[00:09:11] He didn't make introductions but was business like in a cheerful way.
[00:09:15] At the bunkers, Marines were shifting sandbags, cleaning rifles, cooking rations over
[00:09:20] small, primeestone, stoves, one Marine cutting another's hair.
[00:09:25] No one seemed fussed by the captain's presence.
[00:09:29] None of the of the secretiveness or make work you saw at Quantico intended to impress.
[00:09:37] Chaffey's questions dealt with enemy activity to the front.
[00:09:40] The conduct of an ambush sent out the night before the possibility of getting some
[00:09:44] mortar fire laden on a suspicious looking piece of ground off to the right and so on.
[00:09:50] No chat about rations or leave or letters from their girls.
[00:09:55] They were all eating the same rations that it was no leave, a man's mail was private.
[00:10:02] Here and there I noticed there were blackened places in the snow where incoming shells
[00:10:07] had hit.
[00:10:08] No one mentioned them.
[00:10:11] The company frontage was astounding.
[00:10:13] Once again, the school solution was in discard.
[00:10:17] Dog company under strength was covering about 1,000 yards of front, more than half mile
[00:10:24] of rough ground.
[00:10:36] Now the company commander jumped into the trench, a dirt corridor waste deep with dirty
[00:10:40] snow piled on either lip.
[00:10:42] Got to stay in the trench from here on, Chaffey said, show you why in a minute.
[00:10:47] They proceed along the trench and eventually meet up with one of the other platoon commanders.
[00:10:50] This is Lieutenant Flynn, Chaffey said.
[00:10:53] Here in his area now, he introduced us and we shook hands.
[00:10:58] Flynn too had a mustache but it was scruffy lacking Chaffey's elegance.
[00:11:02] He wore no insignia of rank, not even a collar bar and looked like any other marine.
[00:11:08] He had a good smile.
[00:11:09] Now the reason I brought that piece up is because you can hear Chaffey says, you're in his
[00:11:15] area now.
[00:11:17] So he's given that ownership to Flynn.
[00:11:19] He wants to make sure that everybody knows.
[00:11:21] This Flynn's deal down here and that continues.
[00:11:25] We got back in the trench.
[00:11:27] Chaffey let Flynn lead the way.
[00:11:30] It was his neighborhood.
[00:11:33] Now the trench was head high and even deeper with ammunition boxes said in here and there
[00:11:37] as firing steps.
[00:11:39] We passed two bunkers each with a heavy machine gun in place.
[00:11:42] Here there was no hair cutting and the men were all underground.
[00:11:46] So now we're back in old trenches, World War I style.
[00:11:49] Each bunker one read had his back to us his face toward the firing port.
[00:11:55] Open boxes of grenade stood inside the bunkers.
[00:11:59] At the third bunker Flynn tapped on the shoulder of the man on watch.
[00:12:02] He backed away and Chaffey squeezed into pier through the port.
[00:12:06] He knelt there for what seemed a very long time then he squirmed back out and waved me into
[00:12:10] place.
[00:12:11] For the first time I was looking at ground that matched my notion of what it would be like.
[00:12:17] There were three untidy fences of barbed wire a few yards to the front and some rusty
[00:12:21] constant Tina wire looped farther out.
[00:12:24] Beyond that we're a field of snow, popped by shell holes, a few scrubbed pines badly chewed
[00:12:33] and about a football field away, a long dirty mound of snow.
[00:12:37] I turned back and found Flynn's face very close to mine.
[00:12:41] Those are the neighbors, the platoon leader said.
[00:12:48] Now they continue on a little while longer and then Chaffey tells him, we'll skip the right
[00:12:54] flank tonight.
[00:12:56] You know Simone is already, Simone is one of the other platoon commanders.
[00:12:59] Besides, we only have a little daylight and I want you to get settled in by dark.
[00:13:05] You know the division order.
[00:13:06] Replacements don't go forward of the MLR for their first five days.
[00:13:11] The good order lets you get the lay of the land.
[00:13:14] Last summer we lost some new people just because they got mixed up and made a wrong turn.
[00:13:19] They just plain got lost.
[00:13:22] Not their fault of course, but they're gone nonetheless.
[00:13:27] Mac looked downcast at being shackled.
[00:13:29] Don't worry, Jeffy said.
[00:13:31] Five days go pretty fast and we'll count this one day so you only have four to go.
[00:13:35] So Mac, Mac Allen, who's all fired up about getting after it.
[00:13:40] He hears this rule about you can't go forward until he's been here for five days and he
[00:13:44] looks all down-trot and because of that.
[00:13:50] Back to the book.
[00:13:51] They get to a position where they're about to go to sleep.
[00:13:55] They're back in a bunker now and he sort of back in the rear but he's a little bit of
[00:13:59] the rear.
[00:14:00] He's with a more-to-position.
[00:14:01] So the more positions obviously aren't right on the front.
[00:14:04] So he's back with them and it's time to lay down.
[00:14:08] Back to the book.
[00:14:09] That was fine and laid down my mind churning with events the day.
[00:14:13] Hopes and fears both.
[00:14:15] But I was very tired.
[00:14:18] Then the air was full of sound.
[00:14:19] I sat up, Porterfield and Dodge were gone.
[00:14:22] Those are the two guys living in this bunker with them.
[00:14:24] I pulled on boots and snatched my helmet.
[00:14:27] You slept fully dressed with your webbelt on so I had my Smith and I had the Smith
[00:14:31] and Wesson.
[00:14:32] Outside it was black and then just below me a blinding glare as one of the mortars fired.
[00:14:38] It was followed by another off to the side and then by a third.
[00:14:42] Somewhere over the ridge there was the rip of machine gun fire and an unfamiliar fire
[00:14:47] from another weapon.
[00:14:48] I started down the hill to the mortar and placements half sliding on the hard pack snow.
[00:14:53] Porterfield grabbed my arm.
[00:14:55] Lieutenant you don't have to stir yourself.
[00:14:57] You need you sleep.
[00:14:58] Then I tell you we'd probably have a fire mission.
[00:15:02] What is it?
[00:15:03] Gooks are pestering Mr. Flynn again is all.
[00:15:05] Listen you hear it?
[00:15:06] That's a burp gun.
[00:15:09] Once you hear it you'll never mistake it for anything else.
[00:15:13] I like how the guys are out there doing this mortar mission and they're just telling the
[00:15:17] Lieutenant hey you can just stay in bed.
[00:15:19] We got this don't worry about it.
[00:15:21] He's all fired up right in down there they're like hey we got this.
[00:15:25] We don't you need your beauty sleep there sir.
[00:15:27] Just take it easy.
[00:15:28] And a burp gun this is a very common weapon.
[00:15:31] It's the most common weapon here in the Korean war for the North Koreans.
[00:15:36] The North Koreans made it.
[00:15:37] It was called a type 49 the Chinese made a version of it called the type 50 it's all
[00:15:41] based on a Russian version that was called a KPSH41 and this is a 762 by 25 millimeter
[00:15:53] weapon.
[00:15:54] So not not the same as an AK 47 little bit smaller around but a very very reliable weapon.
[00:16:03] Where they call it a burp gun because it's small nurse because the wood doesn't know
[00:16:07] it made noise it makes.
[00:16:12] That's why they call it that.
[00:16:13] Yeah it seems like a burp would be like a small burst of like quick rounds like machine
[00:16:18] them.
[00:16:19] I actually I don't think I've heard one but you know you can even say he says listen you
[00:16:24] hear it that burp that's a burp gun so it must have had a really distinctive sound when
[00:16:29] it fired.
[00:16:32] Back to the book the morning offered no evidence of the night.
[00:16:37] Porterfield made coffee and said there were no casualties anyone knew of though mortars
[00:16:42] might have gotten some people on the other side where they could not be seen.
[00:16:47] The other side they called them that or gooks or people they also called our Koreans gooks.
[00:16:55] The Chinese were chinks but we weren't facing them right now it was all very matter of
[00:17:00] fact how we spoke of the enemy.
[00:17:02] Now obviously those are not the politically correct terms to use but obviously I'm
[00:17:08] all going to also stick with the book because these are the terms that the guys use back
[00:17:11] then.
[00:17:12] The term gook from what I understand I read about a little bit it came from there's a
[00:17:20] there's a term there's a Korean to say America in or American in Korean the term was
[00:17:26] me gook and and so I guess you picture guys meeting you know some Korean soldiers and
[00:17:34] they're trying to see if they're Americans and they go me gook and they go oh you're
[00:17:39] gook okay cool and that's that kind of stuck.
[00:17:42] Kind of like me joko yeah you joko yeah that kind of thing.
[00:17:47] That kind of thing.
[00:17:49] All right back to the book the next four days would pass slowly I felt self-conscious about
[00:17:53] the simplest things should I walk in the trench or a top it if I stayed in it people
[00:17:57] might think I was afraid if I stayed out someone might accuse me of drawing fire and being
[00:18:01] a damn fool they didn't teach you the finer things at Kwanoko I compromised by walking
[00:18:08] a top the trench line but walking slumped so a couple things number one that's the kind
[00:18:15] of thing this young leader's thinking about like what do I appear like to the men if
[00:18:19] I walk hiding in the trench then I'm a I'm a wimp and if I stand up to tall on the top
[00:18:25] of the trench then I'm an idiot so which one do I want to be so he compromised he takes
[00:18:29] the little thing I talked about with when jp was on about how guys kind of slump down
[00:18:35] a little bit they they crouch there they bow their heads when they're walking around just
[00:18:38] to make themselves a little bit of a smaller target that's what he's talking about and
[00:18:41] that's what he did that's how he solved that problem.
[00:18:45] Now as he as he starts spending more time there he starts meeting the guys and he's very
[00:18:51] surprised that they are not exactly as quote unquote squared away as he might anticipate
[00:19:01] because these guys are Marines and he's coming from Kwanoko where everything is spit
[00:19:05] and polish right back to the book fresh from Kwanoko I knew I should not I should be
[00:19:11] righteous about it but it was chaffies company not mine some men wore knee length
[00:19:16] parkas others pile vests or field jackets won a forest green overcoat to his ankles
[00:19:24] there were stolen army jackets turtle neck sweaters a plaid sweater made respectable
[00:19:30] by an issue green scarf tossed jantley over one shoulder there were fur hats and hats
[00:19:37] with ear muffs ordinary fatigue caps and a baseball cap wool stocking caps overseas caps
[00:19:43] helmets some with green some with tan some without any camouflage cover there were
[00:19:50] thermal boots and ordinary boon dockers and jump boots liberated from the army men wore
[00:19:56] no insignia or black stripes painted on the sleeve or metal badges of rank I didn't recognize
[00:20:02] that they got from every breast pocket gleamed a brass spoon hammered from an old shell
[00:20:08] casing a gookspoon I did not know what they were and finally asked one Marine wore
[00:20:15] as purple heart another a nineteen forty eight do we for president button so this is
[00:20:20] not what he's used to he's used to see it guys totally square away and these guys are
[00:20:24] have obviously done whatever they can to try and stay warm back to the book
[00:20:32] fillups took us out to the right flank to see some onus he seemed glad we were there
[00:20:37] but he looked very weary tired though physically and good shape so some onus they had
[00:20:42] heard this story that some onus had done a pretty awesome operation where they went
[00:20:47] across the valley deep into some enemy control territory and killed a bunch of
[00:20:52] North Koreans and then made it back with no casualties so it's kind of a everyone's super
[00:20:56] impressed with this operation and back to the book max said something about his patrol
[00:21:02] the one young doll was bragging about that was the mission that went across the valley
[00:21:07] we were quiet and we were lucky some onus said it was obvious he didn't want to talk
[00:21:13] about it he excused himself saying he was inspecting weapons this morning
[00:21:19] then as they're walking along all of a sudden fillups moving faster than a pump man
[00:21:22] should drop into the trench down he shouted back and I jumped in after him there was
[00:21:27] an explosion in backs and black smoke rising somewhere behind us and then another whiz with
[00:21:31] a bang on the end of it 76 is Philips said squatting in the bottom of the trench flat
[00:21:37] trajectory weapon not as fast as it sounds if you hear the whiz you can usually beat
[00:21:42] the bang I looked past him at Alan Mac was beaming were they shooting at us I asked
[00:21:50] Philips likely they only wasted two so they couldn't have been serious about it just
[00:21:55] trying to instill a little discipline into three damn full marines he didn't seem
[00:22:00] angry at being shot at but we stayed in the trench for a hundred yards until it
[00:22:05] dropped away below the skyline it was all very casual max pleasure being sheld puzzled
[00:22:11] me one thing to be gun-ho about going to war another to be delighted someone was
[00:22:16] shooting at you max fired up this is pretty cool talking about the he's getting
[00:22:25] some education now from one of the one of the enlisted marines named Dodge and
[00:22:30] Dodge says most of the enemy weapons are Russian and the Russians are pretty smart
[00:22:37] about weapons their mortars are one millimeter larger in diameter than ours we got
[00:22:42] sixties and eighty ones they got sixty ones and eighty twos so they can use
[00:22:49] captured american mortar shells they slide in easy and just a little fraction loose
[00:22:54] but we can't use their shells they're just a tad too big for our tubes so
[00:23:00] Soviet unions pretty smart when they came up with that idea with that plan
[00:23:06] back to the book around three o'clock off the left there was a sudden mash of
[00:23:10] incoming mortar fire than a distant shouting chaffy just back from a scouting
[00:23:14] with scouting mission with lisman took off along the ridge towards flint's
[00:23:17] position I started to go but red Phillips barked to me stay put till we know
[00:23:21] what happened then Phillips phone rang it was flint four of his men
[00:23:26] sending themselves on top of a bunker taken a direct hit from an eighty two
[00:23:30] millimeter mortars of a gooks and thrown up without notice just one shell but two
[00:23:35] the Marines were dead another had lost both legs and the fourth was badly
[00:23:40] hold they brought them down past the CP the dead shrouded in ponchos the
[00:23:47] wounded conscious and in pain I stood watching feeling a stranger one of the
[00:23:52] dead was cousin to the man whose legs were gone they came from a town in
[00:23:57] Massachusetts the Marine without legs didn't seem to realize about his legs but
[00:24:02] he was talking about his cousin poor ready he said what's at his mother gonna
[00:24:07] say chaffy was with them at the corner at one corner of the four men carrying
[00:24:13] Eddie in the poncho he turned it over to someone else and went into the CP
[00:24:17] Phillips and I following get some onus chaffy said tell him to send three men up
[00:24:22] to flint for tonight to fill in the line tell him to thin out his own people
[00:24:26] where he can I'll try getting him some more men in the morning he can have
[00:24:29] my runners if he can't if I can't get anybody else they'll have that
[00:24:33] bunker okay before dark it wasn't banged up too badly the men took most of it
[00:24:38] while Phillips made the call chaffy turned to me well that happens no one to blame
[00:24:44] blame the sunshine if you have to lay blame Truman himself couldn't keep
[00:24:49] Marines from getting some sun good men too he hate to lose them anyway but
[00:24:54] losing them like this is stupid it hurts even more we learn though you won't
[00:25:00] see anyone goping off on top of a bunker for a while he picked up the
[00:25:04] battalion phone to call in the casualties so you can see chaffy's got like a
[00:25:10] a certain level of detachment right he's he's got a fair I would say it's
[00:25:16] actually a very good level of detachment where he's even in his own sentence
[00:25:21] he's saying it's horrible lose these guys no one to blame we need to move
[00:25:25] forward it's like the right level of he it hurts he says it hurts even more but
[00:25:31] he's not going crazy he's not beating himself up he's got job to do so there's a
[00:25:36] good level detachment that he's got going on and you're gonna hear more about
[00:25:40] that as well now this was interesting you know on on social media people are
[00:25:47] always asking about EDC which is everyday carry they say talk with your EDC what
[00:25:53] do you carry every day that's what that's what people want to know and when I
[00:25:56] read this this paragraph here I was thinking this is the EDC the everyday carry
[00:26:01] for the Korean War so when they ask you your EDC is a gun or just everything
[00:26:09] you carry knife what do you care for nice and wallet you know you're your
[00:26:14] various things that you carry yeah EDC yeah yeah all right back to the book
[00:26:21] talking EDC we forgot a lot of what they taught us at Quantico but I remember I
[00:26:25] remember Joe Will's lecture Will was a captain who'd been in the hard
[00:26:30] fighting around the poos around poos on the first summer of the war there were
[00:26:34] pictures of Will and his men in life magazine Will had really been to Korea and
[00:26:39] fought and so we listened and took notes Will didn't talk about war aims or
[00:26:44] strategy or even small unit tactics he told you what to take to Korea in your
[00:26:51] pockets nail clippers if your nails grew too long they caught on things and
[00:26:56] became jagged or maybe even ripped off one-a-day vitamins you were gonna miss
[00:27:00] meals and there was no fresh fruit or milk and you need to vitamins to keep
[00:27:04] you going a knife not to kill people with but just a boy scout knife with a
[00:27:08] couple of blades and a screwdriver and all toilet paper there was a package
[00:27:13] in every ration box but there was never enough a flashlight she then black
[00:27:17] rubber for insulation and against hard knocks a pen and a small smile spiral
[00:27:23] notebook you wanted to keep track of your men and to be able to write lists to
[00:27:28] leave notes for people a good watch with a luminous dial you could read at night a
[00:27:33] couple of good-sized bandanas you could use his hanker chiefs they were you were
[00:27:38] always wet and we're gonna catch a cold and your nose would run a toothbrush
[00:27:43] and toothpaste a small bar of soap a razor of course the soap will also work
[00:27:49] the shaving cream some raw-hide leather thongs in case your shoelaces broke or
[00:27:53] you had to make jury rig repairs to something a plastic bag keep your wallet in
[00:27:59] when you got wet an extra pair of wool socks a zip-o-liter for smoking and
[00:28:04] lighting fires you didn't need any stamps or money there was nothing to buy
[00:28:09] and no place to send it the dog tags went around your neck you hung them from a
[00:28:16] leather from leather thong at different lengths so they didn't clink together
[00:28:20] and make noise you wore two dog tags so that if you were killed they would cut
[00:28:24] one off and turn it into the graves registration or some other authority and
[00:28:28] leave one on the body to ensure accurate identification the Marine Corps had a
[00:28:32] system for just about everything people at Cuanoco said Joe will did some
[00:28:37] drinking nights at the officer's club but he gave a good lecture and most of us
[00:28:42] remembered when he told us as I was as I was pretty sure I was going to
[00:28:46] remember what I was learning now from chaffy philips and textless lisman and
[00:28:52] sergeant dodge so there's your EDC for Korea it's it's amazing how some of
[00:29:04] that small stuff gets like in the seal teams that's kind of thing that you'd
[00:29:10] get turned over from somebody that was in an area where you were and you'd be
[00:29:14] all happy to get these good turnovers so somebody say hey you really need this
[00:29:18] up here you need that and it'd be always good and it'd be bad when you'd forget
[00:29:22] or someone wouldn't give you a good turnover and you'd say wait a second I should
[00:29:26] have had this why why didn't anybody tell us that stuff and it was interesting too
[00:29:31] because when we first got over to one of my first deployment to Iraq man we
[00:29:34] were learning so many lessons about what was going on one of the biggest was
[00:29:38] how we were operating in humvies all time because we didn't really do that
[00:29:43] much before the war started solve us and we were just learning a lesson
[00:29:46] a day in how to operate with humvies and we just logged it all down and
[00:29:50] pass it on so the next guys knew what was coming and capture those lessons
[00:29:55] learned and pass them on and by the way when you're coming into theater and you
[00:30:00] haven't done the job whatever job some that you're taking over from somebody
[00:30:03] listen to whatever they're telling you don't go in with your preconceived
[00:30:06] notions you might have your own ideas that's fine I'm not saying don't have your
[00:30:09] own ideas but listen to what people are telling you because they're gonna know
[00:30:13] some things that you don't know and that's all there is to it all right now
[00:30:21] there's a point where it looks like chaffee's gonna decide which one of
[00:30:26] these two guys Brady or Mac Allen is gonna get to take over his
[00:30:31] platoon commander and they're actually gonna do a a coin flip to decide so
[00:30:39] that's just who it is and it turns out that Brady wins the coin toss well
[00:30:43] it's your platoon now Brady chaffee says chaffee says I won't worry about how you'll
[00:30:47] do both of you are ready to take platoon's you'll get yours soon Allen when
[00:30:51] Flynn goes home the thing to remember is we were all platoon leaders once a
[00:30:56] good job the finest command a man can have no where I don't care how long you
[00:31:02] live or what you do will you ever have direct responsibility for so many
[00:31:07] men you can command more men you can be a general with a division but it's
[00:31:12] no longer direct kernels and generals are nodded into the system the whole
[00:31:18] military bureaucracy you make your own system here you run it it's year
[00:31:24] platoon and I have to agree with the fact of being a platoon commander is
[00:31:31] awesome and you have total control and I will say this though I always
[00:31:38] looked at every job like that like every job I got my own you know in time
[00:31:42] I get put in charge of something whether I got put in charge of radios when I
[00:31:46] was a new guy and I just had to be in charge of any people I was in charge of
[00:31:49] radios I was like oh yeah I'm gonna set these radios up like this I'm gonna
[00:31:54] make make that my world right and then when I was got promoted and I was a
[00:31:59] squad leader and all of a sudden yeah I'm like this my squad and we gonna do
[00:32:04] things and so I always to have that feeling of what is basically a feeling of
[00:32:10] ownership right I'll take ownership and I always did that but he's right in the
[00:32:13] fact that once you go above Tune Commander now there's gonna be other there's
[00:32:19] gonna be someone else that's gonna actually own those guys and it's not you
[00:32:23] so you gotta give those two commanders some space so they can do their thing
[00:32:26] what a good job when you get that opportunity for a platoon sergeant
[00:32:32] a platoon chief or a platoon commander it's it's about as good as it's gonna get in
[00:32:38] my personal opinion all right here's here's a again I talked about how how
[00:32:46] Chaffey's sort of the reason why I wanted to do this book and this is a classic
[00:32:50] example good leadership lesson learned for anybody here back to the book
[00:32:55] another order came up which sounded dumb so dumb I thought Chaffey was
[00:33:01] jolly in us the order was to pick up all the brass expended along the line and
[00:33:06] send it back for salvage brass is the military term for empty shell casings
[00:33:11] ejected from weapons when bullets are fired in the states on the firing range
[00:33:16] you're supposed to pick up the brass to police the area to keep it neat but here
[00:33:20] the following morning Chaffey as usual was up and down the company front with
[00:33:26] his wolf slope moving fast without seeming to seeing everything knowing
[00:33:30] everyone he called me into the CP when he got back your machine gunners aren't
[00:33:36] picking up the brass it's piled up around the guns and down the slope did you
[00:33:41] give them the order I said I hadn't considered it a serious order all orders
[00:33:48] are serious chaffey said in turn away I was ashamed and angry it was a ridiculous
[00:33:54] order but chaffey was right I should have carried it out now he caught me
[00:33:58] doping off this was a chaffey this was a chaffey I hadn't seen before a man
[00:34:05] with whom you didn't play games I would not again I didn't want to look I didn't
[00:34:10] want that cold look coming down on me again he didn't shout or curse when he
[00:34:15] chewed you out but he didn't have to you understood so that's any of these
[00:34:23] anybody that thinks they're yelling and screaming that's having this huge
[00:34:26] impact you're probably wrong you're probably wrong you should sell them
[00:34:29] have to do that fear and a leadership position back to the book I hustled down
[00:34:35] the line to give the necessary orders to the gunners who looked at me as if
[00:34:37] I were mad I said they were chaffey's orders and to be obeyed shrugging and
[00:34:43] sulky they started picking up the brass so what does he do what is Brady do he
[00:34:48] gets down there says hey guys pick up the brass when they start looking at him
[00:34:50] like all this is ridiculous he goes hey look it's chaffey chaffey told us to do
[00:34:53] it so do it which is not good leadership that's not good leadership right he's
[00:34:58] passing the buck on up the chain of command a this is bosses this is the bosses
[00:35:02] plan I don't agree with it but we have to do it anyways wrong and he finds out
[00:35:08] just how wrong it is here back to the book it was not until later I learned
[00:35:13] that the order was from young doll and that chaffey too thought it was inane but
[00:35:19] in dog company he issued orders as if they were his own idea without passing the
[00:35:26] buck or permitting any reflection on higher authority it would take time before
[00:35:32] I learned to do the same so when you pass that word you can argue all day
[00:35:36] long up the chain of command but once the decision's been made and now you're
[00:35:40] talking to the boys that's your order now that's your plan that's your idea you
[00:35:45] own it
[00:35:50] all right now they spend a little bit more time up on the line and the
[00:35:55] make-o-back to the reserves into the rear for a little while and when they go
[00:36:00] back to the rear it's their their marine so they're continuing to stay
[00:36:05] disciplined they call them night problems with that means exercises when I say
[00:36:09] problems sometimes I'm gonna forget to say this but when they say problems they're
[00:36:12] talking about exercises back to the book the night problems went on in the
[00:36:17] inspections and drills and all the chicken shit of reserve area chicken shit is
[00:36:21] a term that they use in the military is just stupid stuff that they make
[00:36:23] you for no reason right it's just a common term is that all this is chicken
[00:36:27] shit like hey we're gonna paint these paint these rocks white that's the big
[00:36:31] thing you know we're gonna clean this sidewalk again hey we're gonna sweep up
[00:36:35] the parade ground again we've swept the yesterday we're gonna sweep it again
[00:36:39] let's just check and shit stuff the weather got colder and worse but I began
[00:36:44] to feel wonderful suddenly I stopped thinking about minds and about losing my
[00:36:50] legs the hell with it worrying it and being afraid wasn't going to help
[00:36:54] after that I felt fine one afternoon coming back from a live fire problem
[00:36:59] Mac Allen and I were in such high spirits we fell behind the party just to
[00:37:02] wrestle in the snow out of pure delight I was easy for Mac but we had a fine
[00:37:07] time and rolled halfway down the bank and nearly into a stream Mac scrub my
[00:37:12] face with snow before we quit and stuff to handful down my shirt it was
[00:37:16] boyish it was silly and we knew it but with another tour on the line coming up
[00:37:21] you took pleasure where you could so he's he's got a little attitude change
[00:37:25] number one he's over this idea of being afraid of minds and being afraid
[00:37:29] he's like hey I can't control it do everything I can't mitigate but it is
[00:37:33] what it is and then of course sometimes you got to get a little roll in
[00:37:37] little bit of a roll and now they get back back on the line and again I'm
[00:37:47] obviously skipping sections of this because I'm not going to read the whole book
[00:37:51] you should read the whole book but they're back on the line and now Brady is
[00:37:57] in charge of a platoon he's a platoon commander and Chaffee comes around to to
[00:38:03] check out his kind of his his section of the line back to the book my bunker
[00:38:10] was toward the base of the nose where it joined the main ridge so nose a little
[00:38:15] little terrain feature that stuck out and that's where his bunker is I showed
[00:38:20] Chaffee over the ground not going all the way to either flank it was too late
[00:38:24] for that and dark was coming but I gave him the gist of it keep 50% of men on
[00:38:29] watching till I tell you different all right I I sir this looks like a good
[00:38:34] line Brady better than the last yes it does sir we've got work to do though
[00:38:40] get some more wire in plot the minds and don't get too relaxed just because it's
[00:38:45] high any hill marines can climb down the gooks can climb up get relaxed and you'll
[00:38:50] find trouble I said I wasn't too relaxed Chaffee greeted that with a grin I
[00:38:56] don't imagine you are first night on the line with a new platoon I laughed it
[00:39:01] was getting late the sun gone now but Chaffee walked away but Chaffee
[00:39:04] walked with me for a way the two of us alone not much I want to say Brady you'll
[00:39:10] do a fine job for me I'm not worried about that but one thing they don't tell
[00:39:15] you at quannico and maybe they should get to know your people as marines as
[00:39:20] professionals learn their capacities their strengths their weaknesses but don't
[00:39:25] get to know them as men none of this first name stuff don't ask about their
[00:39:30] families or their hometown whether they're married if they've got kids do that
[00:39:35] and before you know it you'll lose your judgment you'll be sending a man out on
[00:39:40] point because he's single and not because he's the best point man there's
[00:39:45] something else get to know your men too well too personally and when you lose one
[00:39:50] you'll be losing a piece of yourself a platoon leader can't afford that
[00:39:54] it's bad enough losing men without losing pieces of you too remember that
[00:40:01] Brady it's hard learned and it's right I said I would remember Chaffee went off
[00:40:08] bouncing along the icy path and down the hacked out steps the reverse slope in
[00:40:13] the gloom a lean tireless figure who did not look back who told you what to
[00:40:19] do and left you to do it now that that section obviously in in in the
[00:40:28] seal teams in special operations in general there's definitely a much closer
[00:40:32] relationship between the officers and the senior enlisted guys and the
[00:40:37] troopers that just the way it is I mean you're doing everything together you're
[00:40:41] going through training together you're you're doing everything together so you that
[00:40:44] that that wall between the ranks definitely gets degraded somewhat and this is
[00:40:53] something that I talk about all the time and this is part of the dichotomy of
[00:40:57] leadership right this is part of the dichotomy of leadership and and what you do
[00:41:00] is you know you're gonna have your relationships with your guys but you got to
[00:41:04] make sure that you're not you gotta make sure you keep those on a control and and
[00:41:09] like for me I was it was fairly easy for me to have really good relationships
[00:41:15] with guys to have to have guys that were my best freaking friends and be like okay
[00:41:20] and you're the best guy for this job so you're gonna go to that and I didn't
[00:41:23] I I never let the personal things crossover into my business in my my
[00:41:30] tactical reasoning ever it just didn't happen and that's why I definitely had
[00:41:36] better relationships close relationships than what Chaffey's talking about here
[00:41:39] no doubt about it you know and I think that's beneficial in a lot of ways
[00:41:45] because yeah you know you know what's making guys tick and obviously the down
[00:41:51] fault of that is that when you do lose guys you are gonna lose a PCU and that's
[00:41:58] the reality of it now going back to the book he gets another visit from the
[00:42:14] kernel the kernel comes up on the line so the guy above above Chaffey and the
[00:42:19] chain of command comes up same thing just looking at his trench in what he's
[00:42:22] got going on back to the book the kernel said where are your machine guns the answer
[00:42:29] was I didn't know exactly what I said was they're down with the squads the first
[00:42:34] squad has won and the second and the lieutenant what bonkers are your machine
[00:42:39] goes in guns in do you know they're fields of fire how would they late do you
[00:42:43] have aiming stakes in no sir you should know shouldn't you yes sir then find out
[00:42:49] I sir the words floated in the crisp cold of the hill as the kernel hop gently
[00:42:56] into his chopper and left I got on the phone to call Chaffey I told him I thought
[00:43:01] I'd better since the kernel surely would Chaffey didn't say much over the phone
[00:43:05] well he said I guess you better go out and chart your guns head and you now this
[00:43:11] is something if you're in a leadership position and you get inspected up the chain
[00:43:17] command you and you said yourself oh should I tell my immediate boss that
[00:43:22] something's gonna come back yes you should is the answer yes you should don't
[00:43:27] let your boss is get you don't ever want your boss to get blindsided with
[00:43:31] something same thing you know in the military we'd have guys getting trouble out
[00:43:34] in town yeah and like get arrested kind of some kind of stuff get arrested getting
[00:43:39] a fight whatever now this is this is what I how would I would handle those
[00:43:44] situations if I could contain them right if I could contain them myself and I
[00:43:49] could punish the guy myself on handlet at my level I would do it but if it was
[00:43:54] something that was gonna get out of control and we weren't gonna be able to
[00:43:57] stop it if it was gonna be in a newspaper or something like that well then I
[00:44:00] tell my boss like this is what happened I had one of my idiot guys went out
[00:44:03] got drunk out and fight went out call some problems this is what happened so
[00:44:08] that way he's not getting blindsided by it he can prepare for it he can
[00:44:10] have an answer he can say that this is the punish that's being dealt out or
[00:44:13] whatever get the thing handled yeah so when something like this happens tell your
[00:44:18] boss what's going on just it's gonna be uncomfortable for those 12 seconds
[00:44:22] that it takes for you to get those words out of your mouth once those words out
[00:44:26] of your mouth I promise you'll feel better you will definitely feel better
[00:44:30] back to the book chaff he didn't say anything more he didn't need to but I
[00:44:34] knew there was plenty he would have said there was plenty the kernel of the
[00:44:38] regiment would say to the kernel of a Italian who in his turn and in the
[00:44:42] hallowed traditions of the core would have a few words for chaffy I felt
[00:44:46] pretty bad it seemed unfair a fine officer like chaffy a good man should
[00:44:50] suffer because a green junior officer dope off but it was the way things were
[00:44:56] and the way it had to be later in the day chaffy met with fillups and the three
[00:45:02] platoon leaders he stressed as a might a teacher in kindergarten the importance
[00:45:08] of basic things the precise location of machine guns being only one of
[00:45:13] these fundamentals he made no reference to the kernel none to me he simply
[00:45:19] reminded us of the things he wanted done and said he expected them to be done
[00:45:23] then he and fillups loped off to look at something in the rest of us drifted back
[00:45:28] to our platoons I wanted to tell the rest of them it was my fault we'd been
[00:45:32] lectured I wanted to hug trat chaffy for not saying so these were mistakes that
[00:45:38] came with still being an amateur in a professional's war so there's another just
[00:45:42] great example of leadership he couldn't he could hammer Brady and say look
[00:45:47] Brady did this and he doesn't know what his guys are doing and he didn't know
[00:45:50] where's machine guns are made us all look bad he didn't do that no no and said
[00:45:55] he doesn't mention Brady's name he tells everybody they got to get stuff done
[00:45:58] now it is Brady want to do better for him yes he absolutely does he's building
[00:46:04] that building up that leadership capital with his troops by not drop and
[00:46:08] dime on somebody making out an example out of now is there times where you have
[00:46:11] to do that of course there is but this one was nothing major right a
[00:46:14] little stern talking to you from the kernel hey I can absorb that not gonna
[00:46:19] not gonna make Brady look bad but I'm gonna build up that loyalty
[00:46:24] yeah now they go out in operation in a guy named Fitz gets wounded and it
[00:46:36] almost he's he and Brady's actually also very close to the mine that goes off
[00:46:40] but he's okay and at night he gets back to his bunker and there's a guy named
[00:46:46] Princeton who's taken over his senior enlisted guy kind of his sergeant that's
[00:46:50] working for him and here we go back to the book that night I worked hard at
[00:46:55] tidying my half of the bunker eight very little but enjoyed what I had and tried
[00:47:00] unsuccessfully to get Princeton to talk about the days events I gave that up
[00:47:04] and wrote a number of letters separate ones to my mother and father telling them
[00:47:08] what happened and that I was okay and that I love them and another to a girl
[00:47:13] the girls tall and lean and very pretty and quite exciting but we had never
[00:47:18] really meant anything to each other now I wrote her quite dramatically that I
[00:47:23] nearly been killed that my eyes had been opened and as soon as I got back we
[00:47:27] should begin to consider the future we've wasted an awful lot of time you and I
[00:47:32] the letter concluded it was a college boys letter and in the morning I tore up
[00:47:39] all three letters chiding myself for being calo and sent a free paragraph letter
[00:47:43] home in which I discussed the weather in some detail Princeton who wrote to his
[00:47:49] wife once a month shook his head over all this correspondence I just love
[00:47:55] that he's he's just growing up he's growing up fast on the line in Korea
[00:47:59] first he's right good girl I almost got killed and this is what's going on and I
[00:48:03] get what we need to consider our future together he just rips that up in the
[00:48:06] morning and then writes his parents about the weather that's classic
[00:48:12] and I totally agree with Princeton who's right and what you don't if you're on
[00:48:15] deployment don't get in this mode where you're spending all your time trying to
[00:48:19] thinking about what's going on back home concentrate on what you're doing overseas
[00:48:23] the most but the best thing you can do for your family it's concentrate on what you're
[00:48:26] doing overseas so you can lift and you can win that's what you want to focus on
[00:48:31] you let your family you know contact them once a week hey what's going on
[00:48:36] everything I'm doing great that's another thing is you know you don't need to tell
[00:48:39] your family back home all the stuff that's going on just say look we're doing
[00:48:43] great I'm having the best time it's a lot of fun miss you and I'll be home
[00:48:47] whatever I hope every house Johnny's you know grades in kindergarten let's talk
[00:48:53] about that how's it how's he like in his jiu jitsu class is he working on his
[00:48:57] armac houses communal look let's stick to those subjects not gonna all crazy
[00:49:05] all right now this is uh he starts going into a description of what some of the
[00:49:10] guys were like has now he spent some time with any he's getting to know them back to the book
[00:49:14] I started to get to know my men like most people my age I've been brought up on Hollywood's
[00:49:19] idea of a marine platoon a demographically ethnically balanced blend of wasps and the
[00:49:26] rest of us you know a Brooklyn jiu street wise but sensitive a big city Italian talking
[00:49:33] baseball and making of seam arm gestures behind your back a dumb hayseed farm boy with a
[00:49:39] girl back home a heroic black man a Puerto Rican or Mexican with a rosary muddering
[00:49:44] Spanish wisdom a feisty little Jimmy Cagni Irishman with a chip on his shoulder a
[00:49:50] goulosh of stereotypes the reality in Korea was somewhat different my platoon had no jiu's one
[00:49:58] black no Hispanics one Indian certainly and so on there were Protestants and Catholics
[00:50:05] and few who are nothing and that was it some Irish some polls some Italians a few French
[00:50:12] and the Irish were sober and it was the Midwest roobs who got emotional while the Italians were
[00:50:18] being my fodical and flagmatic nor were the battalion officers what the Marine Corps
[00:50:25] had traditionally been southern gentlemen now we were easterners Ivy Leagueers college kids
[00:50:32] California's Californians men from Detroit and Chicago and Seattle so a little different from what
[00:50:39] you might imagine not quite as diverse as they made it out to be in Hollywood now going to a
[00:50:48] little more detail about a rifle platoon in the Marine Corps in Korea back to the book a marine rifle
[00:50:56] platoon in Korea was a superbly balanced tactical unit with enormous firepower and an
[00:51:00] eminently sensible fundamental premise eminently sensible fundamental premise in combat no one man
[00:51:10] can reasonably be expected to control directly and effectively more than three other men in a
[00:51:17] firefight you can't keep tabs on more than three Marines and still be aware of the enemy
[00:51:23] a marine rifle platoon has three squads whose squad leaders are trained to maintain contact with
[00:51:28] the platoon leader when he issues orders he issues them not to 40 men but only to these three
[00:51:35] sergeants in their turn each control three fire teams each of which is commanded by a corporal
[00:51:42] fire team leader they look to the squad leader for their orders he to them for action in the fire
[00:51:51] team the corporal has three men whom he controls and who look always to him during a firefight so
[00:51:58] this is just a very clear explanation of decentralized command and when you're out on the battlefield
[00:52:06] you can't control 30 guys or 60 guys or 20 guys or even 10 and actually he makes a very good point
[00:52:15] he says in a firefight you can't keep tabs on more than three Marines and still be aware of the
[00:52:22] enemy so maybe if you weren't didn't have to worry about the enemy and what they were doing maybe
[00:52:25] then you could handle six or 12 but you gotta worry about what the enemies do and do you're gonna
[00:52:30] a lot of other stuff to worry about so you can handle three guys and you see this this happens in
[00:52:35] the business world as well where people start to build little worlds where they have where they have
[00:52:41] direct reports they have 18 direct reports that's not gonna work that you should not have 18 and
[00:52:47] administrative situation I think you can handle 78 maybe you can get to 10 maybe I don't recommend
[00:52:59] the fewer direct reports you have and the more you empower and the better off you're gonna be
[00:53:03] the more you're gonna be able to look around the more you're gonna be able to see what your competitors are
[00:53:06] doing you more time you have to spend on strategy when you have 12 or 16 direct reports you don't
[00:53:12] even have time to think because you're in their worlds all day long you're not in your world you're
[00:53:17] in 18 different brains that just doesn't work yeah so set yourself up with decentralized command
[00:53:27] now we go into back into where they're just on the line and we're about to have a little
[00:53:37] bit of action back to the book we were waiting awake Prince and cleaning is M1 rifle like most Marines
[00:53:44] then the first grenade exploded followed by a second and a third the phone sounded at my
[00:53:51] year it was chaffy the man never slept what if you got up there Brady is that your area where
[00:53:58] we're getting grenades yes sir over by the heavy machine gun section I gave him the closest
[00:54:03] mortar concentration as I was trained to do then I tried to cool down the affair but there's nothing
[00:54:09] else maybe someone's a little shook over there throwing a shadows no firing anywhere whether
[00:54:14] not supposed to throw grenades a shadows chaffy tell them to hold their fire until they see something
[00:54:19] want me to come up there no sir chaffy asked to be kept informed so chaffy's just saying hey
[00:54:26] look get this handled you want me to come up there because by the way I can come up there if need be
[00:54:31] no I got it and then the snow comes and when the snow comes it's brutal back to the book even
[00:54:49] chaffy was grounded by the snow he held his daily company meeting by telephone transmitting the
[00:54:54] password giving a brief account of the fighting elsewhere checking on the conditions of the men
[00:54:58] and irregularities in supply there were no patrols but chaffy urged us over and over not to be
[00:55:06] old not to relax to be alert when everyone else might nod to scout out the ground each day
[00:55:13] whatever the weather to see to it the weapons were clean and lightly oiled oil froze in this cold
[00:55:20] you couldn't use much Prince and I alternate visiting the flank of each pertune once a day
[00:55:26] in this snow it was easier to duck into the bunkers to talk to inspect weapons to question
[00:55:33] the men at the firing ports they brewed cocoa or coffee and I took it so this is something that
[00:55:42] we see consistently from chaffy is that he is constantly on his guys to maintain their discipline
[00:55:49] right and even when things are going okay he always says hey yeah that's good job on that
[00:55:55] guess what let's not get laks and that's exactly what he's doing right here urge us over and over
[00:56:00] not to be low not to relax somebody's got to be driving that back to the book a new
[00:56:08] tenant had just joined Fox company an enapolis graduate a trade school man a matter of
[00:56:14] understandable pride already in the battalion are very own academy graduate he had four years
[00:56:20] of anapolis behind him all those parades all that tradition all those army navy games and another
[00:56:27] four months at the basics school at quannico fox company was very excited having him it made
[00:56:32] everything so official so grand but beyond that he seemed good man a cool and professional young
[00:56:39] officer who would do his job his name was folder and his nickname was lucky and he was 22 or 23 years old
[00:56:48] when the bar man squeezed off the burst marines came out of every bunker along the fox company
[00:56:55] line and on my flank a dozen men with rifles and bars started down the hill after the raiders hoping
[00:57:02] they could move faster than the dooks with their prisoners hoping to catch them before they crossed
[00:57:06] the river and disappeared into their own minds falter would not yet been out in front of the line
[00:57:12] because the five-day rule was one of the first men to reach the grove of trees as he and others ran
[00:57:18] through the low pines hurtling over the spring the deep funk of mortars drifted up to us from
[00:57:26] across the valley all around falter marines threw themselves flat in the snow pulling helmets
[00:57:34] down tight over their ears legs pulled in close cupping their bodies against what they knew
[00:57:39] was coming falter had never heard an incoming mortar before one of the first shells hit lucky falter
[00:57:47] i'm reading who is nearby said falter made no sound could not have known he was hit no one else was hit
[00:57:54] only falter scary thing and i talked about that before on here and being in situations where you
[00:58:06] can hear the mortars and obviously you learn what that sounds like and falter hadn't learned it
[00:58:13] and didn't know it was like and you know probably no one even thought that you know because i was
[00:58:19] thinking about how's this happened no one tells me to get down i'll tell you how that happens
[00:58:22] everyone else it's so instinctive at this point they hear it and they get down they're not looking
[00:58:26] around they just think everyone knows like oh yeah obviously we got Morris coming no one yells out
[00:58:30] in calming they just everyone gets down and he just doesn't know it yet and that lack of knowledge
[00:58:39] costume is life and that's why another thing when you're doing turn over with guys overseas
[00:58:45] like go into detail on stuff and stuff that you take for granted don't take it for granted
[00:58:50] and if you if you think if you're worried about appearing condescending to someone just go ahead
[00:58:56] and appear condescending go ahead and go over the details to say look man i don't mean i know you're not
[00:59:00] stupid but i'm just gonna go over this just in case you didn't know here's the deal when you hear this
[00:59:05] noise funk that means mortars are coming so get down now we get Brady started to do some
[00:59:16] patrolling i back to the book i took out the first patrol for dog company Nelson squad it wasn't
[00:59:20] required that the patoon lieutenant go out but it was sensible showing you wouldn't send a patrol
[00:59:26] where you wouldn't go yourself so common thing you know you if you're sending your guys out
[00:59:32] make sure they know that you're going to go out too you're not just sitting back in the bunker
[00:59:36] we saw that in patoon leader remember the book and Vietnam where the one patoon leader every day
[00:59:41] his patoon's are going out or his squads are going out but he's just staying back there oh hiding
[00:59:46] mm-hmm yeah don't be that guy moving forward a little bit back to the book i lost two more
[00:59:56] men one of them danker had a fire team in the third squad danker was one of the men wounded
[01:00:01] its September on 749 that's a hill bit they found a big battle 7 hill 749 you're going to hear
[01:00:06] about that Brady wasn't on it put some of a lot of his veterans were his wounds were cured
[01:00:13] but he was only a month away from rotation and he was shook that's what they called combat fatigue
[01:00:19] danger danger did everything he was told to do but he was afraid he begged prince and to do
[01:00:23] something then when a chaffee's runners broke a leg on the ice steps and i sent danker to the
[01:00:29] cp is a runner he came to thank me lieutenant i haven't searched you but if i have to go out
[01:00:35] in another ambush i'm scared i'll do something bad and get people hurt i don't know i just can't
[01:00:40] know more control the way i am the way i feel i used to be a good man he began to cry
[01:00:47] and i turned away and told prince to get him settled up that the captain was waiting so
[01:00:52] we're starting to see some some psychological impact on the guys and i think i think that
[01:00:59] Brady handles this perfectly very similar to the way dick winners would handle it oh we got a guy
[01:01:03] that started losing a little bit get him off the line give him a break give him a rest and the
[01:01:08] big thing that winners points out dick winners i'm talking band of brothers first the five o'clock
[01:01:12] one of the things that he put points out is if you get the guy off the line they they'd come back
[01:01:18] they'll be okay if you don't and you grind them out it's like having an engine that's low on oil
[01:01:25] if you get it to the service station they'll just put more oil in there come back it's going to
[01:01:30] it's going to be fine if you keep driving that thing dry on oil it's going to be destroyed
[01:01:34] and that's the same thing that can happen with with people with people's minds
[01:01:41] you know see some more minds get start to become affected by this back to the book
[01:01:45] Kelso the machine gunner lost a man it wasn't the gooks that did it but the wind
[01:01:51] we'd been on the line three weeks and the wind never stopped one night Kelso's corporal went
[01:01:57] berserk firing off a heavy machine gun inside the bunker trying to kill rats that no one else saw
[01:02:02] they carried him off in the morning cursing the wind and the rats jooling and trying to tear off his
[01:02:09] clothes prints and looked at him foughtfully i was shaken by the sounds coming from a good
[01:02:15] marine a solid nco so again both these guys danker and this this guy right here they're good marines
[01:02:24] that just couldn't they just got they just had enough and they need to get off the line they need to
[01:02:29] break back to the book we lost other men only fits Gerald squad did not lose anyone
[01:02:41] fits would not permit himself to be evacuated the morning i trip the mind and he would not
[01:02:47] permit his men to quit he was tough but he was more than that he was the best we had and his
[01:02:54] men knew it and they refused to weaken even when weakness closed in on them fits Gerald drove them
[01:03:03] and they drove themselves that's such a great indicator of what leadership is all these other people
[01:03:10] losing people people are going crazy they're they're they're combat fatigue they're being overcome
[01:03:16] fits Gerald is a leader and he holds the line and that makes his guys hold the line
[01:03:22] and it says you know it's he was tough but he was more than that it's not just about being tough
[01:03:31] being tough only gets you a part of the way there yeah this is uh this next loss of men is just
[01:03:40] awful back to the book back Allen lost men his patoon sergeant took out a typical patrol
[01:03:48] terrible cold but no fighting they came back in about two a.m. using a fixed rope that to help
[01:03:54] them scramble up nearly sheer ice below the wire came in half frozen and tired
[01:04:01] mac was there to meet them to check in each man as he questioned the patoon sergeant about the
[01:04:05] patrol the sergeant remembered damn me mister Allen we left the rope out there hanging down
[01:04:12] from just below the wire the sergeant yelled for another marine to give him a hand and disappeared
[01:04:18] over the lip of the ridge with a husky blonde marine in tow mac was back in the bunker taking off his
[01:04:25] boots when a burst of machine gun fire then another ripped through the mountain stillness
[01:04:32] outside marines were running mac pulled on the boots and crawled out grabbing a man running by
[01:04:38] where's the patoon sergeant where's the sergeant and wind gate in the confusion it took a few
[01:04:44] minutes to find them they both lay dead on the forward slope big wind gate draped over the wire
[01:04:51] the sergeant curled up looking like a man taking a nap on a red and patch of snow one of Allen's
[01:04:58] machine gunners knew the patrol was in but no one had fought to tell him about the two men
[01:05:03] going back out to retrieve the rope as they came back he took them for gooks trailing the patrol home
[01:05:10] trying for a straggler and he fired off two short effective bursts he was a very good gunner
[01:05:19] and he caught both men in the face the rope was coiled neatly over the sergeant's shoulder
[01:05:25] wind gate was in my machine gun patoon on 749 before being transferred to max patoon not
[01:05:32] a terribly good marine a brooder most men disliked him one of the few friends he had was the gunner
[01:05:40] who killed him knowing what losing sergeant and wind gate would mean to mac I called him on
[01:05:47] the company phone to talk about it he wondered if he should have just left the dam rope out there dangling
[01:05:53] no matter that the sergeant should have passed word that they were going back out this was max patoon
[01:05:58] and these his men and their deaths his deaths it carried the body to the supply tent just
[01:06:07] below the company cp and laid them out the cold would take care of them through the night and in
[01:06:12] the morning the gook train would come through but when the gooks got there and ate stretcher bears
[01:06:18] fell out to approach the supply plant tent to pick up the dead and carry them down the hill
[01:06:23] a marine stopped them the gunner who'd killed wind gate and the sergeant he had sat crying all
[01:06:30] might in the tent sitting over the bodies and now he stood just outside the tent flap dry eyed
[01:06:36] but holding a 45 automatic you're not taking them he said the gooks dropped the two stretchers and
[01:06:44] scattered along the path and both directions crazy marines the stretcher lay on the ice
[01:06:51] chaffy walked up to the gunner give it here corporal he said you know wind gate wouldn't want you
[01:06:57] doing that stay back skipper the corporal said he waved the gun crying again now and shaking his head
[01:07:04] I was down there by now with all the excitement and to me it was pretty clear a fast man
[01:07:09] standing this close could jump and a new chaffy was very fast but the captain just stood there
[01:07:16] easily hands on his hips fill he said fill you know Johnny wouldn't want anyone hurt over him
[01:07:26] the corporal didn't move for an instant and then he shook his head and his right arm flexed
[01:07:31] then fell the pistol hanging loose in his hand chaffy reached out to take it
[01:07:37] then he did something I would not have done he slipped the 45 back into the corporal's
[01:07:42] holster patting him on the shoulder and waved the gooks to come to the tent
[01:07:47] then chaffy and fillups and eye with the corporal's help lay the two bodies very gently on the
[01:07:53] stretchers they were frozen solid and handled like cordwood the corporal sat in the snow crying
[01:08:00] until red fillups got him to drink some coffee and go back to his bunker
[01:08:04] I realized it was the first time I'd heard chaffy call a marine by his Christian name
[01:08:14] so this blue on blue and I seem to hit this in every book that we we talk about it for some reason
[01:08:20] it's something that doesn't get taught very often it didn't get taught to me in great detail
[01:08:26] the detail I wish it got taught in something that happens happens as simple as this I
[01:08:32] always got the rope we're going to go back out and grab it and then you got two dead marines
[01:08:36] killed by another marine I mean it's just an awful situation so don't ever take any part of an
[01:08:42] operation lightly ever and make sure you keep people informed of where you're going to be on the
[01:08:48] battlefield and there's nothing harder when you're when you're leaving the lines you got to let
[01:08:52] people know don't take it for granted that people understand what's going on so these are kind of
[01:08:58] things that are happening back to the book so the gooks were not the only danger we were killing
[01:09:03] ourselves and breaking our legs and falling sick and cracking up and being carried away
[01:09:11] it was how it was in a mountain of war and deep winter but the gooks were to have their chances
[01:09:16] both Mac Allen and I had lost men and now it came Simonis's turn so Simonis is the guy that
[01:09:31] I'd said I had done a big operation it was pretty successful hadn't taken a gas leaves
[01:09:35] and killed a bunch of enemy and now we're about to do any encounter with him some things are going
[01:09:42] sideways for him back to the book I heard the firing before I was really awake part reality part night
[01:09:48] mare I sat up suddenly in the bag Prince and was up and dressed and he handed me a canteen cup
[01:09:55] hot with coffee very strong and black the way he made it Prince went on fussing with domestic
[01:10:00] chores keeping a tidy bunker Mr. Simonis is catching it he said Simonis had taken a patrol
[01:10:06] down the mountain the night before and ambitious affair affair all the way into the valley
[01:10:11] he should have been back and into the line by this time it was almost six I tried to call the
[01:10:16] CP but nobody answered they must all be out trying to do something about Simonis then I remembered
[01:10:22] that Chaffey wasn't there he torn his hand helping men lay barbed wire it had become infected
[01:10:30] and he was down at the battalion getting it repaired Chaffey had no business out there musseling
[01:10:35] wire but tried telling Chaffey not to do things so there's Chaffey's not around the square
[01:10:42] away company commander's not around so it's actually fill ups that's running the company right
[01:10:46] now and you got Simonis supposed to be back in the wire but he's not he stuck out in the in the
[01:10:52] field and Simonis had had radio contact and he'd been caught out there at first light as they
[01:10:58] went across a little stream and they got mortar they got hit and so finally Brady goes and
[01:11:07] and gets to fill ups and talks to him fill ups just back to the book fell was standing in front
[01:11:13] of the CP looking saw him look red I'll take some people down there if you want with
[01:11:18] stretchers and help Simonis get out of there fill ups looked at me for the first time and
[01:11:22] in what seemed to be focus yeah yeah he said that's a good idea I sent a fire team down already
[01:11:28] with a corpsman and some blood but they're gonna need more than that good idea get a squad of
[01:11:33] people together I appreciate this get them back I appreciate it they came to me he was afraid maybe
[01:11:41] they wouldn't be back and so Brady gathers up his troops and they take off he says he's feeling
[01:11:52] afraid but he's going anyways and they take off down the hill and it's it's a long distance but
[01:11:59] they get make it up very quickly because they're traveling light and they're heading downhill
[01:12:03] which is pretty easy no it's obviously easier than going uphill back the book I was at the bottom
[01:12:07] before I expected a dozen or more marines lay around in the snow some under pines under some pines
[01:12:14] at the edge of flat ground there were two dead Simonis told me and seven wounded out of 12
[01:12:20] only one of the wounded was really bad and he might not make it the others were walking wounded
[01:12:27] it was the mortars that caught them in the open ground at first light they must have had the
[01:12:33] concentration registered he said because there were no ranging shots just silence one moment
[01:12:38] and shells were wearing the next there was no firing at all from either side so one thing that
[01:12:45] one thing about mortars is first of all they're hard to shoot accurately and we talk about
[01:12:51] ranging what you do is you shoot one if you try to hit a target you shoot the first one long
[01:12:56] and then you shoot the second one short and then you take the two the compromise and two in the
[01:13:00] middle and then you're going to hit your target so that's that's how mortars work so what they have
[01:13:04] in this situation when he said that they must have had the mortars registered that means they already
[01:13:08] have and they know that spot and they don't have to range them at all they can just drop them and
[01:13:12] the other thing that so mortars they can just you don't always hear that sound of them being launched
[01:13:17] especially if it's further away you're not going to hear that or different atmosphere occurred
[01:13:22] noise conditions you know if you've got heavy cloud cover that reflects the noises but if you
[01:13:27] don't maybe you don't hear it maybe different terrain doesn't let you hear noises just like noises
[01:13:32] reflecting around in a city and the other thing about mortars that is is hard to understand
[01:13:37] mortars coming all different shapes and sizes and small mortars are tiny they're tiny little 60
[01:13:43] millimeter mortars they're tiny and I mean it's six centimeters right that's how big it is they're
[01:13:47] tiny little things and then it goes all the way up to 120 millimeter and now they go bigger than
[01:13:53] that but the common is you know as big as 120 millimeters yeah yeah it's big yeah and so
[01:14:02] what you end up with the main point of this is that these things when mortars hit the shards
[01:14:09] the the the shrapnel that comes off them people think of shrapnel is being little tiny things
[01:14:15] and I've talked about this before shrapnel is big shrapnel is giant shrapnel can be eight
[01:14:21] to ten inches long I mean just giant and they're thick shrapnel can is a half inch piece of steel
[01:14:27] just a big chunk a half inch piece of steel it's brutal and so when it hits them in these guys
[01:14:34] totally unexpected there's walking and boom it's it's devastating but the shooting it stopped
[01:14:43] back to the book they had stretchers out and rolled the bodies aboard strapping them on with their own
[01:14:48] belts and then four men lifted coffee and slid or stretcher under him so coffee will this a big giant guy
[01:14:55] they said he's over six six just a monster of a guy God knows what he weighs but he's huge
[01:15:03] and so they got a carry him and like I mentioned that they were running downhill to get to him
[01:15:08] well now to get back they got to go uphill the whole way we heaved him up and started off
[01:15:13] up the trotting snow slowly as it had to be with his weight on the hill the hill reached
[01:15:20] endlessly upward so they are trudging and it doesn't take long for them to be like exhausted
[01:15:29] back to the book the other three men looked as bad as I felt we were all tired the four of us and
[01:15:34] among us there wasn't a damn shred of sympathy anymore for coffee the cause of our exhaustion of
[01:15:39] our misery we all hated poor coffee old when I realized this some pride seemed to back into me
[01:15:46] we were all in the same fix I didn't want to be the first to give up but if I didn't give up soon
[01:15:52] I would die there with coffee old there in the snow broken by the impossible load we carried
[01:15:59] I was climbing now with my eyes shut not wanting to see how much hill remained my mouth wide open
[01:16:05] and gasping we all fell again the third time like Christ under the cross this time I didn't
[01:16:12] get to my feet but crouch there gulping air around me the others were still down then
[01:16:18] Simone is at my side time to change over we'll take him for a stretch so this is just a brutal
[01:16:23] physical evolution that's happening I was back to the book I was thirsty but my canteen was frozen
[01:16:31] solid Princeton was always warning me about that but I hadn't wanted to add whiskey the way
[01:16:37] Princeton I regretted it now and scooped up smooth snow from just off the trail and let it melt in my mouth
[01:16:45] so imagine that you're just devastatingly thirsty and boom you go to get your drink your canteen
[01:16:50] it's frozen completely solid brutal now they continue I mean it's it's it's just a heinous
[01:17:01] evolution that they go through they finally get him back up back to the book the climb was over
[01:17:08] 13 hours after it began over for today tomorrow could be the same or worse it really wasn't
[01:17:17] fair that having done so much there was still so much to do you never really mastered war never
[01:17:23] got on top of it it was always too big there was too much to it ever to finish the job now
[01:17:39] it goes from that just brutal situation I mean imagine 13 13 hours but you think it's you think
[01:17:45] you're gonna be back in like 45 minutes right hand run out we'll help these guys we'll get some
[01:17:49] stretchers and then you you run down there it's 13 hours later your dehydrated but he starts to go into
[01:17:57] some reflections now of what it was like some other parts of the war and you're gonna see he's
[01:18:04] gonna oscillate back and forth as he describes some of the stuff but it's all really good
[01:18:08] information and things to think about back to the book when you weren't fighting the war was pretty good
[01:18:15] mornings were the best time the terror of the night ended the patrols and ambushes and duck
[01:18:22] blinds men slept late when there was snow it in the night it lay smooth and on track no industrial
[01:18:30] smokestack or city set turning it down or in gray no vehicles to turn it into slush it hung
[01:18:38] glistening on the pine branches until the sun warming as it rose thawed it into tiny shining
[01:18:44] icicles glistening melting drop drop men crawled out of their bunkers into the morning calm
[01:18:51] the industrious using entrenching tools to dig away the snow tidying the trench so there's
[01:19:00] that's the dichotomy of war and he's gonna go back and forth on this dichotomy quite a bit
[01:19:06] do you know I mean guarantee you experience that to where overall it's just this really junk
[01:19:15] situation overall but then all those little almost like micro pleasures you know how it's
[01:19:20] this little thing they kind of add up and then you kind of miss them yeah it's interesting
[01:19:25] that never even mind micro that's one of the reasons I'm in this chapter you're gonna see like
[01:19:30] he's talking it goes back and forth about what makes it good and what makes it fun and there's
[01:19:36] something and I've talked about the story there's something so pure about being overseas fighting
[01:19:42] a war you know to think about anything else yeah you like you don't think about anything else
[01:19:46] and just this pure thing that you have then nothing else in the world matters and that feels good
[01:19:52] I love that feeling yeah even like what if you think packed you tear I don't know
[01:19:58] so certain some people they're like oh yeah my college days where I was oh so broke there's all this
[01:20:03] like junk stuff and how much better it is now but you think back on just the the small good
[01:20:09] parts you know like yeah well you definitely everybody everybody self edits their past and
[01:20:13] remembers the good stuff more than the bad yeah right I mean that definitely happens yeah if I
[01:20:18] didn't happen you know I've heard said if that didn't happen women would never have more than one
[01:20:22] kid right because it doesn't give in birth this is like a really tough evolution so I don't
[01:20:27] want to do that again but the reality is women have all kinds of kids despite the toughness of
[01:20:32] that evolution because they were not with the good stuff yeah especially I mean sometimes if they if they
[01:20:36] kind of leave that experience with a bad idea of it then then they'll self edit the other way
[01:20:44] like all it was just junk but you know those times when it's like we always kind of miss those times
[01:20:49] well to say there's all kinds of when you're on deployment there's all kinds of frustrations
[01:20:53] and and there's infighting and there's all these problems and then you get back for and everyone hates
[01:20:58] each other you get back everyone's like oh yeah yeah you said all that stuff is out yeah yeah
[01:21:03] when you think when you go on deployment if you make it back and you know and get back it's like
[01:21:10] you know you've done a good thing you know to go fight for your country is a good thing straight up so
[01:21:14] you know that seed it's pretty rare you're gonna emerge thinking oh man we shouldn't have done that kind
[01:21:20] of thing yeah no that's definitely not a few of them overall you know overall so that's one of
[01:21:26] those things where yeah it's the way you're gonna self edit it's gonna be in the good way you know
[01:21:30] so you're gonna be oh I miss all that miss that time even though it was miserable and I think
[01:21:34] what's cool is I think you're gonna see here this here he goes back and forth like he's definitely
[01:21:38] self editing some of the good stuff but he's also going right into some of the his description
[01:21:43] and we'll get to it here in a minute I think it's I think it's in this section but he's talking
[01:21:46] about like when the night comes and it's awesome we'll get there in a minute back to the book
[01:21:53] Princeton like most regulars made a fetish of shaving daily water was always short we melted snow
[01:21:59] and can't teen cups over Coleman stoves and parceled out from five gallon Jerry cans
[01:22:06] water maybe is the heaviest thing Marines ever have to carry we never washed there wasn't water
[01:22:12] for that I suppose we smelled pretty bad but you stopped noticing the air and the bunkers
[01:22:18] lighted by candles and warm by Coleman stoves was so foul that you spit suck and body
[01:22:24] oomer odor didn't really register you never changed clothes except for socks I had two pairs of
[01:22:30] heavy wool socks and I tried to change every day the socks you put on were filthy but after 24 hours
[01:22:36] they were dry the sweat evaporated frozen feet were continual fear we all knew the horror stories
[01:22:43] from the winter before many lost toes or an entire foot sometimes both feet if you could somehow
[01:22:49] keep your feet dry the cold wasn't as dangerous you might if the Koreans didn't get you or a mine
[01:22:56] or an accidental discharge or a short round survived the winter with limbs intact how the socks
[01:23:02] smelled didn't matter only if they were dry and there's a part there's a part of the book that I
[01:23:06] didn't talk about that I didn't highlight at least I don't think I did but they're they're showing
[01:23:12] them a film to get ready to go to Korea and the film is of a guy with frost bitten toes
[01:23:17] and the surgeon he's not even using a knife he's just the toes are just they're just coming off
[01:23:23] like breaking off a toe like breaking off a toy off a branch and you know that kind of thing right
[01:23:29] there we'll make a try and keep your feet dry back to the book if I had one I smoked a
[01:23:35] cigar chewing the stub into pulp spitting juice onto the snow at my feet onto my thermal boots it
[01:23:42] didn't matter which there were no inspections up here none of the garrison chicken shit you
[01:23:47] lived with a quannico or penultin or even in reserve these were good times too afternoons looking
[01:23:54] at the mountains in the snow and smoking and spitting with knowing to complain scratching yourself where
[01:24:00] you witched your groin or your belly or wherever you're in a country this lovely unless you
[01:24:06] are someone was shooting at you or sending you out on patrol if you could stay warm and dry
[01:24:11] and you knew there was a one more can of sweet peaches or pairs back in the bunker the war
[01:24:17] wasn't so bad so that's awesome that's what I'm talking about you're over there there's no
[01:24:24] it's weird because there's all kinds of rules when you're in combat but they're different rules
[01:24:27] and the the rules of normal life they don't apply anymore and you just do whatever you want
[01:24:31] they don't have a case is you know oh this is an orc as smash it oh I don't like this
[01:24:35] gonna break it oh there's something over there shoot at it it's fun it's awesome and then
[01:24:43] yeah and then like you know he's literally talking about you know just scratching yourself like
[01:24:47] you're just it's just man's world right I mean at least it was for me just a bunch of guys
[01:24:52] hanging out with a cool job and so it's awesome it's fun now things you're gonna see this is
[01:24:59] that this is that paragraph that I was talking about it's awesome then by 230 or 2405 in the
[01:25:08] afternoon the sun would start to fall toward the ridge line and the wind out of Siberia would pick
[01:25:13] up and I would begin to shiver not just from the cold but knowing that the good time was nearing
[01:25:21] its end that darkness was coming the dark and the night and the terrible cold and unless we were
[01:25:28] lucky the fighting I hated to see the dusk come in combat there are no beautiful sunsets
[01:25:36] a falling sun is a warning of the night the shadows lengthen and the temperature falls and the wind
[01:25:44] seeks you out men begin to move around now restless nervey bizzing themselves with chores to take
[01:25:51] their minds off the night breaking down weapons one more time for cleaning rearranging their
[01:25:55] grenades and bringing in the sleeping bags left out for a day's airing heating a supper of
[01:26:00] lime of beans and ham before dark once the night comes there may not be time once the darkness falls
[01:26:08] the good times are passed the pleasant indolence the contemplation of the day is gone by 430 there
[01:26:16] is no more sun and then only a swift dusk and then the real night cold and frightening and too
[01:26:23] often deadly yeah I was this is something else to think about this is like a daily reminder to me
[01:26:35] because I was I was watching sunset if I have the opportunity yeah but like I reread this book
[01:26:40] for the podcast and so lately now when I'm watching the sunset this is what I'm thinking about
[01:26:45] about what these guys were thinking it's all nice and pretty here in California wants to sunset
[01:26:49] it's not always like that do you think that that kind of robbs you of the experience here or do
[01:26:55] you think it adds to I think it adds to it a hundred percent because I'm not sitting I don't I'm not in this
[01:26:59] reality I'm not in their their reality I'm in my reality sunset means look looks nice the wind calms down
[01:27:05] you get to see a beautiful sky that's what sunset is but I get to contrast that with what these
[01:27:11] guys experience with the true darkness coming and what that meant to them the fear that they were
[01:27:16] going to face every single night and it's amazing that every single day they wake up and enjoy that
[01:27:22] day they enjoy that icicles dripping water and they would relish that even with the imminent
[01:27:29] darkness coming they relished what they could and I think that's a good lesson for anybody to learn
[01:27:34] yeah yeah that's what I'm saying if you can manage to do that you know not only do the
[01:27:41] keep things in perspective but it'll enhance your experience you know exactly you got to know the
[01:27:46] darkness back to the book if you've never been to war and this is going back to us oscillating
[01:27:55] a little bit in the other direction about the good times if you've never been to war you cannot
[01:28:02] realize that some of it not all of it of course but some of it is such sheer boyish fun you
[01:28:10] lived outdoors you are physically active you shared the boisterous camaraderie of other young men you
[01:28:16] shed fat and put on sinew and muscle except for those nagging minor hurts you were clear eyed
[01:28:23] in generally healthy and your body responded instantly and instinctively whenever called upon
[01:28:29] you slept like the dead not even the domain you of the ration box killed appetite
[01:28:34] you saw the dawn and the night and the stars and came to calculate time and date by the phases
[01:28:41] of the moon and on those rare days of fall you heard the gurgle of running water under the snow
[01:28:47] heading toward the valley in the sea you smelled the pines and listened to the wind and you could
[01:28:53] sense when the snow was coming and new to the instant when the sun would rise when the sun would set
[01:28:59] a city boy I was falling in love with the country those first months in the hills if only
[01:29:07] I could get home to tell about it I hoped I would live until spring so that's the other side of it
[01:29:17] and that's I completely agree with it you're you're you're you're so focused and you're
[01:29:23] with your guys and there's nothing else to worry about and you're all working towards common
[01:29:26] going it's awesome that's just the dichotomy of war moving on back to the book you learned
[01:29:36] from men like chaffy a yaly with a wall law degree from Harvard who came from money a handsome
[01:29:43] man physically courageous and tireless from all that could have come arrogance snobbery
[01:29:51] but possessed he possessed neither of those traits he was only calm and vigorous and efficient
[01:30:00] usually cheerful decent and humane a good man a fine officer and you learned from men like
[01:30:07] corporate geese who might heard one day expounding on what was wrong with war movies you notice
[01:30:14] in the movies geese said marines never shit john wane or none of them they never have to take a
[01:30:21] crap never how can you believe the rest of a movie where no one ever takes a shit
[01:30:29] I have to agree with that and actually if you read this book he goes into some details about
[01:30:34] that that are that are really good just some of the minute details things like shitting
[01:30:38] yeah that that are really there hilarious to read it's it's great stuff and it's and again
[01:30:45] it's the kind of details that those are the they part of the life yeah you know it's like in
[01:30:51] an iraq you you basically are always shooting in these little portabodies portabodas portabodas right
[01:31:00] and so there's a whole like they're in the summertime they're like solanus we call them solanus
[01:31:06] blue stonus because it will blue and there's flies in the middle it becomes its own little thing
[01:31:10] right and then it's gonna talk about that I mean I guess I just did but that's that's a big
[01:31:16] like when I go when I'm at an at a event somewhere and I got a you want to talk about flashbacks
[01:31:21] you put me into a portabodas somewhere and it's hot I'm thinking I'm an Iraqi means to me
[01:31:25] and there's flies and it's just horrible that's the way it is that's one of the little
[01:31:29] things and he definitely goes into some great details in this book about all all kinds of stuff
[01:31:32] yeah that we don't really think about well another thing that was interesting is he talks
[01:31:37] about he talked about the ways his canteen's being frozen but back to the book in this cold dry
[01:31:43] air your throat was always parched your canteen might be frozen and you longed for drink I vowed
[01:31:50] once the war was over never again to pass a faucet without pausing to slake my thirst with a glass of
[01:31:57] cold water you don't think about these guys being thirsty but they were absolutely now we get into
[01:32:05] some back back towards some of that psychological issues that guys are coming up against we're
[01:32:11] beginning to learn a new word for someone who had a bad scare who is losing his nerve we said he
[01:32:16] was shook English majors such as me wonder why it wasn't shaky or shaken or something grammatical
[01:32:24] but it was always shook and you knew what it meant it had little to do with the old world war
[01:32:31] shell shocked that was another very precisely defined thing that came from being too close to an
[01:32:36] incoming shell shook was nerves in general and once you had a man who was really shook you tried to
[01:32:42] get rid of him because he was no good to you anymore it was the 76 is coming in flat and fast
[01:32:49] or mortars dropping on you or fear of mines or maybe too many duck blinds and night ambushes
[01:32:56] or a win that never stopped blowing those were what made you shook and so he's actually
[01:33:03] he's saying that it's different from being shell shocked because he's saying that shell shocked was
[01:33:08] a precisely defined thing that came from being too close to incoming shell and they've actually
[01:33:13] they've actually that's not true yeah shell shocked was an only from in fact it was not just from
[01:33:21] the concussion the concussion absolutely causes problems in your mind but shell shocked world war
[01:33:26] one any war that you go into it's it's PTSD right it's it's it's it's fear it's the thinking
[01:33:33] things to get bigger tonight it's all those things building up yeah fear of losing your legs it's
[01:33:36] all those things so when he's talking he says it's not the same thing as shell shocked but then he says
[01:33:41] it was the 76 is which are flat trajectory rounds coming at big giant rounds coming at you
[01:33:47] mortars dropping on you fear of mines so it's being afraid that's what he's talking about
[01:33:52] is what makes you shook and it's the same thing in the world war one world war two you go to any
[01:33:55] war and you want to know what causes psychological damage it's prolonged fear of
[01:34:01] maiming death and seeing your friends get maimed and killed that's what I believe it is.
[01:34:11] I heard that shell shocked is like when they say shit the expression shell referred to your head
[01:34:18] like your shell got rattled maybe they use that in football or something but you know for me shell
[01:34:25] shocked the reason they said it was from showing you know that's what they said and again go to
[01:34:30] I've said this on the podcast before going YouTube and watch the guys that came out of World War
[01:34:35] one that was shell shocked it's it's horrible it's a horrible horrible thing to see and it
[01:34:39] like makes just makes you feel so thankful that you didn't have to go through what these guys
[01:34:46] went through and but it's the same you know it was to an extreme and the worst part about World
[01:34:53] War one of thought about this too is like when those guys reach their breaking point
[01:34:57] they got called they got sent back to England like oh this guy's a coward and of course the
[01:35:03] people that are calling him cowards were people that were never on the line I mean a lot of them and so
[01:35:09] yeah it's really it's really horrible I think we do a much better job of taking care of
[01:35:13] guys that you know you went and did this for your country and you went through a little bit too much
[01:35:18] okay cool let's give you break let's give you a breather right and take care of take care of our
[01:35:23] veterans something we absolutely we do better then but we always need to focus on taking care of
[01:35:30] veterans here's an example of you know what what these what condition these guys get into back to
[01:35:37] the book the most bizarre was an enlisted man and dog company who had been out a long time
[01:35:42] and who had been in a lot of fighting a fine marine a good solid man but now with the rotation
[01:35:49] draft beckoning he began to act funny refusing to wash or shave and he would not get out of his sleeping
[01:35:56] bag that was the strangest part he didn't refuse to muster or go on duty but he went everywhere
[01:36:02] and his sleeping bag he cut out the bottom of it so he could walk taking mincing little steps his
[01:36:08] arms and bodies completely inside the bag and the hood of the bag over his head only is bristly face
[01:36:13] showing he lined up for meals that way I don't know how he handled going to the head
[01:36:18] max said it was a psychological return to the womb I didn't know what to make of it he only had a
[01:36:24] few days left and no one wanted to run him up for bring charges because he was a better
[01:36:28] very good man but people moved away when they saw him coming because they knew he was spooked
[01:36:34] because they had he had begun to smell much worse than the rest of us maybe he was shooting in the
[01:36:40] bag some people insisted he did he didn't seem to mind being snubbed as he hoped as he hopped
[01:36:46] around the battalion with those little steps content to be in his bag he was shook
[01:36:52] gauntlet some said and I think that's the reason I highlighted that one is because they're taking
[01:37:00] care of they're like hey we're not going to bring up and charge good a few days hey let him walk
[01:37:03] around the state bag it's all good now hopefully they got him some help when he got out or when he
[01:37:09] got off the front and said hey you need to go talk to somebody and you know relax a little bit
[01:37:14] give this guy a little breather now moving forward again jumping forward in the book a little bit
[01:37:23] they're they're planning an operation and they call this operation mole mole was a splendid plan
[01:37:32] the sort of exercise they would probably be discussing at staff colleges for years bragging up
[01:37:38] its genesis lying about its actual accomplishments so here we they're talking about what the plan was they
[01:37:51] call it mole the idea is that the day after tomorrow towards sunset it will be made to seem that the
[01:37:55] entire division and divisions all along the line are pulling back to new and better positions
[01:37:59] for after the snow melts and when the fighting resumes we'll seem to have pulled back several miles
[01:38:05] maybe more we'll sit there on the reverse slope and then until dark and then we'll crawl right
[01:38:12] back into our bunkers then for four or five days we sit in our bunkers not going out of all by
[01:38:17] day and little is possible at night no patrols no firing no nothing and wait for the gooks to take
[01:38:24] the bait and come marching up the hill so that's the plan this is big deception plan and that
[01:38:32] they all think it's pretty they don't think it's the most effective plan they could come up with
[01:38:38] back to the book it was all bullshit a silly flamboyant scenario and not a real operation
[01:38:43] that was how we felt and chaffy must have known but he didn't carry favor with subordinates
[01:38:48] by criticizing the brass mori that again he didn't carry favor with the subordinates by criticizing
[01:38:55] the brath he had argued with the battalion and lost here he passed on orders and said he expected
[01:39:03] dog company would carry them out impeccably so again you see chaffy never he never breaks even
[01:39:09] something you know he doesn't agree with it he made his arguments and then he says okay guys
[01:39:14] here's what we're going to do and molins up being fairly unaventful and
[01:39:21] they they end up coming back down off the line a week later we were relieved and
[01:39:28] regimen came down off the line dog company again going down by helicopter we had been
[01:39:33] 46 days on the line living in holes I had not taken off my underwear in 46 days my hands were
[01:39:40] so dirty if I rub them on the bare ground they became cleaner since the skin couldn't
[01:39:44] absorb any more dirt but only chuck it off under friction my sore throat was gone and I felt
[01:39:51] wonderful I was not the same man who had gone up the hill January 10th no better or any worse
[01:39:58] just different in a month and a half of fighting we had not moved an inch forwarder back
[01:40:05] a few minute died on both sides the men changed but the war did not
[01:40:14] again very similar to World War I trench warfare not as bad in terms of devastating
[01:40:20] numbers of casualties but the progress is just not there they come down off the line
[01:40:28] now they get some good food they get some showers they get lined up for showers I was at the end of
[01:40:33] a line you sent the enlisted men first if it was something pleasant shower a shower you went first
[01:40:38] if it wasn't the rules were so simple once you learned them classic classic leadership you know
[01:40:46] if you're so some good to be done give it to the boys if not you got to you got to do it
[01:40:58] now this is this is a very another just great viewpoint so they when they're in reserve
[01:41:07] so they're on the line on the hills in the trenches or they get pulled back off the line
[01:41:14] in their back in the rear and there's no real threats and they're doing these exercises and
[01:41:18] problems and clean new weapons and maintenance and healing up and all that and during that time
[01:41:24] they actually have opportunities to fly to Japan in this case and they they call it like
[01:41:30] logistics run to go to Japan but what they're really going to do and they get to Japan is
[01:41:36] get with some women and for the Paltoon you can get with some women for themselves
[01:41:42] and then for the Paltoon they're going to bring back some booze it's like a booze run and in order
[01:41:47] to be the guy that gets to go for the geisha girls you draw straws and whoever get draws a straw okay
[01:41:54] great you get to go to Japan for whatever it is three days have a great time blah blah blah blah well he
[01:41:59] draws the straw and he decides that he doesn't want to go he wants to stay with the battalion he
[01:42:09] doesn't he thinks he'd be wasted on him to go in years why and so I stayed with the battalion
[01:42:15] the thought of that girl of any girl was immense within me but that was another world those
[01:42:21] things didn't belong here after five months this battalion these hills these men were what mattered
[01:42:31] there was a purity of life on the line a crude priesthood of combat that I didn't want a
[01:42:38] soil for a few days of pleasure you didn't get laid up here you tried not to even
[01:42:44] model your mind thinking about it I had no religious scouples about it not this time it was as if
[01:42:51] Japan a trip to Japan would have spoiled something betrayed the battalion and my men and myself
[01:42:58] I couldn't imagine John Chaffey on a booze run and for me Chaffey was the model so there's he talks
[01:43:10] about that purity it's a real thing I'm telling you it's a real thing it's a real thing the
[01:43:17] purity of combat in a war it's a real thing it's a evil thing but there's something about it
[01:43:24] now things start to springtime comes and things start to fall out but you can it's not all good
[01:43:32] back to the book the fall brought up green buds and turn the roads to mud here in the valleys
[01:43:38] on the hills there were snow slides and at the briefing Gregory told us that along the line
[01:43:44] bunkers were collapsing under the weight of layers of sandbags in one regiment two men were
[01:43:49] suffocated in one bunker another Marines back was broken when his bunkers slip sideways and slid down the hill
[01:43:56] Fox company lost a man when he stepped on a mind during a night exercise both legs were blown off at the
[01:44:02] knee and by the time they got him back to camp and a surgeon he was dead a machine gunner shot his
[01:44:08] bunk mate with a 45 then one night there was an alert and the battalion moved out fast and trucks
[01:44:15] to a support position the alert was nothing the gooks never came but a Marine fell out of the
[01:44:22] one truck and was run over by the truck behind so the war went on no fighting to speak of
[01:44:30] and yet Marines continued to die the mountains killed them and the cold and now even the
[01:44:37] fog inspired to kill them and they killed themselves and each other and sometimes the gooks had
[01:44:45] their turn at it so springtime doesn't even really don't even really mean it's gonna get any better
[01:44:54] and it's gonna be fighting season as well so I haven't talked too much about the enemy
[01:45:01] and I thought that this was a really good little excerpt of the enemy and give you good insight on them
[01:45:11] so one of the guys comes back from an operation and tells him gym we killed one guy on patrol
[01:45:18] the other night brought in the body because we wanted proof you know they carry this little kind
[01:45:24] of service book in their pockets this chink he enlisted or got drafted or something back in 1936
[01:45:31] he fought the japs for nine years then in 47 he fought the reds for China then when Chang put out
[01:45:44] bugged out to Taiwan they just turned him around put a red star on his cap and in 1950 he's in
[01:45:51] creating us now he's dead 16 years of professional soldiering and all that combat and that son of a
[01:46:00] bitch is still just a private soldier I got kids in my patoon got out of high school last June
[01:46:09] so you get these guys again that's that's just crazy life right you fight the japanese
[01:46:16] for nine years then you fight when the communists were fighting against uh Chang high Kai's Shek
[01:46:22] you're fighting with him against the communists and then once that doesn't work out you just turn around
[01:46:27] and you start fighting with the communists against the americans hard hard enemy and the
[01:46:36] Korean soldiers were hard as well the Korean soldiers that were fighting alongside the americans and
[01:46:42] they still have a reputation of being very hard I never actually worked with uh Korean marines but they
[01:46:47] have a reputation of being very very hard and tough soldiers here's an example that in the book
[01:46:56] maybe a little too hard some Korean marines were on 749 too that's the hill I talked about earlier
[01:47:05] pure said when we made the top and there were no more gooks to flush out we dug in hoping they
[01:47:12] wouldn't come back we were thin we didn't have much left across the saddle the Korean marines were
[01:47:18] on top too the hill was secured but there was a bunch of Korean marines over there shouting and
[01:47:24] arguing about something then they kind of stood back in one of them melt down and this guy came up
[01:47:31] very close behind him and took out a hang on and shot him through the head one minute he was kneeling
[01:47:37] there and then he was dead I was tired as hell but I stood up and started yelling across the saddle
[01:47:43] with them I'm yelling at them to stop and waving my arms and one of them waves back being friendly
[01:47:51] later I found out they executed the guy because he was slow getting up the hill but when I saw
[01:47:58] him he was on top and none of them had been there very long so how slow could he have been
[01:48:03] but they shot him anyways hard now as far as a little more detail on the marines here
[01:48:23] each marine rifle battalion has one or two aviators who are active flyers but who for brief
[01:48:29] periods of time are grounded and attached to the battalions to call in and coordinate air strikes
[01:48:34] or direct reconnaissance over enemy lines so this is something that's just one of the things that
[01:48:40] makes the marine course so awesome if you can imagine this so you know how hard it is to train a pilot
[01:48:45] right they've trained a pilot to be a fighter pilot it's like you know they're just a tiny tiny
[01:48:51] percentage of human beings in the world that are jet pilots fighter pilots and if you're in the
[01:48:58] Marine Corps and you're a pilot at a certain point in your career they pull you out of your fighter
[01:49:05] jet and they put you on the ground in combat to go and call fighter jets for support and this is a
[01:49:16] you end up being a group in a group called Anglico which is an air naval gun fire liaison company
[01:49:23] and they're so their marines and they do call for fire they call in aircraft and we worked with
[01:49:30] we worked with them extensively in Ramadi and as a matter of fact we had Anglico with the
[01:49:37] Anglico went with seals on I would say 90% of the operation that I don't know what I don't know
[01:49:42] what the numbers but a massive number of operations is a matter of fact one of the guys is
[01:49:46] we're probably going to bring one of the Anglico guys that was the exact thing that I'm talking
[01:49:51] about was it was a fighter pilot and we showed him Ramadi and he's an Anglico guy on the ground
[01:49:57] went on all kinds of operations went on ton of operations with life and I'm going to
[01:50:02] we're going to bring him on the podcast because we just he's just an awesome guy and here his
[01:50:08] here his story but that again that's one of the things that makes the Marine Corps so awesome
[01:50:12] is they're like oh you're you're a pilot in your super high speed in your well trained that's cool
[01:50:17] that's that's fine you're a rifleman get on the ground and start calling for fire
[01:50:22] it's awesome and one of the one of the Anglico guys that they had here
[01:50:29] back to the book Ramon had been shot down the month before his plane had gone in over
[01:50:35] friendly ground but he had been concussed so now he was with the battalion and at least for the
[01:50:40] moment once again a foot soldier of course in a sense all marine flyers are still in
[01:50:45] for treatment this is what the book says and the core tries to make it so with every flyer
[01:50:50] reverting for two weeks a year to commanding troops or running problems as an infantry officer
[01:50:55] all of them were trained that way in the beginning at Quantico but some flyers or naval
[01:51:00] aviators as they are called sometimes are softened by the good life as pilots still in a pinch
[01:51:05] most of them can do a competent job on the ground and that's yeah again that's just one of the
[01:51:11] things I love about the Marine Corps is they do that and we're gonna get where to get my buddy Dave
[01:51:16] on here to talk about what that's like and what it was like for him think about it you're in a
[01:51:21] jet you know you're in a jet fighter plane your missions are gonna be a couple hours long right
[01:51:28] that's not long they're gonna be and then you're gonna be back on an aircraft carrier with or you
[01:51:32] know on an air base with the good chow and all that stuff and boom you know what all that's going
[01:51:37] away we're gonna put you in the field and you're gonna get after it so it's very cool
[01:51:46] all right now we get into just a war so there's a Korean that comes in to talk to
[01:51:59] the approaches them and and needs to talk to them about something and he's the headman of a
[01:52:03] village and they have an interpreter with them and we'll go to the book he says two Marines
[01:52:08] came to their village this morning they shouted for women the people close themselves in their houses
[01:52:14] and a few ran into the fields the Marines tried to force some doors open but couldn't get in
[01:52:20] then they went to the house of these two women to the guy has two women with them who are mother and daughter
[01:52:26] when the women would not open the door the Marines fired their guns in the sky
[01:52:30] the women were afraid so they opened the Marines went inside and closed the door when they came out
[01:52:37] they went through the village shouting at the houses and telling people not to tell anyone they had been
[01:52:42] there or they would kill them this man knows some English words he understood what they said
[01:52:49] then the Marines left and the people came out it was agreed they should come to tell what happened
[01:52:54] and to ask for justice that is what he says so obviously these two Marines got that gone
[01:53:06] into this village break to these women and it's Brady that gets assigned with Mac I believe to
[01:53:17] investigate all right the Colonel Gregory's at Regiment all assigned you to investigate as
[01:53:22] investigating officers report to me when you have something he turned back to go back inside the tent
[01:53:29] one more thing I don't mirror mine Marines being a little wild and I don't much like a
[01:53:35] gooks but we're not going to have rape this battalion is going to have discipline their
[01:53:42] Marines we won't have rape he went inside so they do an investigation and it doesn't take
[01:53:53] Brady long to figure out who these guys were and then they do a line up basically they bring a
[01:54:01] bunch of Marines and they do a line up and they have the women there and the women identify
[01:54:06] the rapists and back to the book Scott dismissed the rest of them I turned to the machine
[01:54:13] gunners you matter under arrest Jardine Saso take them down to the exec if he tells you
[01:54:20] take them to division to the brig mr. Alman Allen and I will write the report
[01:54:26] it disgusted me Marines shooting up a village terrorizing people raping those two old women
[01:54:33] with their faces like baked potatoes how could they do it how did they think they could get away with
[01:54:40] it this way we were as bad as the Nazis and the japs attacking civilians attacking women
[01:54:47] it undid everything we were trying to do saving their country for these people giving it back to them
[01:54:54] in that village they wouldn't remember that Americans died for their two bit village
[01:54:58] they would only remember their day of horror when two Americans two Marines for God's sake rape
[01:55:06] their women at gunpoint the blonde marine was the son of a minister the other was up for
[01:55:13] promotion to curb corporal the records had been excellent and now they faced a general court
[01:55:20] this damn reserve this being around civilians it was no good we'd been too long away from the war
[01:55:27] losing what we add on the line the pride the discipline the professionalism not wanting to
[01:55:34] say anything to Gibson who wouldn't understand or even to Mac who would I longed for the clean
[01:55:39] hard purity of the line dedication and celibacy harsh and cleansing puritanic that was the line
[01:55:49] that's where we belonged yeah and this is again combat leaders out there or you know this is the
[01:56:05] kind of stuff these were two Marines that didn't that had good records and you get them off the line
[01:56:12] you put them back in the reserves now they're interacting with civilians and you know they're
[01:56:16] ruining their ruining these women's lives they're ruining the strategic war effort and the
[01:56:21] ruining their own lives so as a leader you gotta you gotta keep your eye on this
[01:56:32] back to the book another section two nights later catheter one of the new dog company
[01:56:36] puttoon leaders took a combat patrol out the route we had scouted crept up quietly on an
[01:56:42] important bump in the ground called hill 69 and caught some chinks asleep
[01:56:48] catheter and his men drop grenades into the bunkers and shot them down as they came scrambling out
[01:56:53] they killed thirteen chinks and came back without a casualty unless you counter marine who
[01:56:58] tours neon the wire I went over with catheter in the morning the maps and paper and other stuff
[01:57:04] he'd brought back catheter was very relaxed and calm about it so much so that when we broke I've
[01:57:11] rarely very nearly snapped off a salute the man was so young so new yet so competent and
[01:57:18] unexcited about what he'd done in seven months I hadn't seen a good as action as this one a
[01:57:23] perfect exercise and catheter just seemed slightly bored even the kernel had catheter into
[01:57:30] shake his hand and tell him what a fine example he'd set for the rest of us so here was a new guy
[01:57:35] been on the line for a couple days goes out and conducts an awesome operation kill thirteen
[01:57:39] no no casualties back to the book the next day catheter came down with a bad case of the nerves
[01:57:47] a delayed reaction and announced a charlie Logan heating wanted to take out any more patrols
[01:57:53] if a transfer could be arranged he would welcome it Logan knew you couldn't have an officer who was
[01:57:57] shook leading a rifle to tune and the transfer came through to motor transport and catheter the brief
[01:58:03] and unexpected hero went off new guy kicking ass still gets to him so you don't you got to have
[01:58:15] the open mind on who's gonna be affected by this stuff and win because you don't know win
[01:58:24] now we get to a Brady's back on the line and he's running basically a distraction operation
[01:58:33] so there's a main effort there's hitting a one hill and he's just hitting this village where
[01:58:39] they seen a lot of Chinese army activity and they're just doing sort of a distraction operation
[01:58:47] on this village to take away from this main attack that's going on elsewhere as they're going in
[01:58:52] all of a sudden there's some sniper fire and one of the lieutenant's gets hit back to the book
[01:58:57] Mr. Settles hit someone said I ran along the trench bent double until where I got this
[01:59:02] they'd laid settle out in the trench sniper sergeant told me I didn't know his name or
[01:59:07] recognize his face must be a new man but he was a cool one I would try to keep that in mind
[01:59:12] where is he anyone see a muzzle flash that's what counts first in a firefight not the casualties
[01:59:20] but where the fire is coming from think about that one that's what counts in a firefight now
[01:59:27] what they can't use these are but where the fire is coming from think about that never
[01:59:32] aspect of your life not just like hey oh this is bad that's happening okay what is creating
[01:59:37] the problem you know I see that with businesses where they get focused on the the internal
[01:59:43] that's fine but no what where is this problem coming from what is causing this problem
[01:59:49] so when you have bad things happening focus on where it's coming from what's the route of the
[01:59:54] problem now they kind of get get pinned down a little bit and they're not making any progress
[02:00:07] and finally Brady says look I said this is just a diversion we're here to hit that village
[02:00:12] with four juices that's all but this sniper didn't anyone see him even get a sniff
[02:00:18] no one had look this is stupid one lousy sniper isn't going to fall up this whole operation
[02:00:24] it's five after six now we're late we've got to hit them as soon and take their minds off
[02:00:29] fox company out there get your riflemen your bar set up sweep the valley fired anything you see
[02:00:35] moving there's no high ground within sniper range so he's got to be down there in that bush
[02:00:40] and tall grass you observer tell them they can start with their ranging shots HE around the village
[02:00:46] then we'll give him complete in a couple minutes fire for effect got it everyone said yes sir
[02:00:54] so i've gotten asked this and i think we we actually answered it on the podcast but this is
[02:01:00] a situation where things are starting to go shaky and this he's not he's not throwing out the plan
[02:01:04] like hey what do you guys think we should do now and hey here's the reason why no he's saying this is what
[02:01:08] we're going to do we're going to make it happen and everyone looks at him and you know what they say
[02:01:12] yes sir and they're not just saying it because they're well trained Marines they're saying it
[02:01:16] because in a moment when they they're unsure of where they're supposed to do they're unsure of what's
[02:01:20] going to happen and somebody steps up and takes a leadership command of the situation you know what
[02:01:26] people say they say yes sir you see it like they teach you have a scene of an accident you know
[02:01:30] they say someone you look at someone say go call 911 you that's what you do and people go okay they
[02:01:35] do it why because there's a pressure situation going on and they want to get that thing handle
[02:01:39] but they don't know what to do so when you when there's something going on and things are starting
[02:01:42] to go a little bit chaotic you need to step up and say take charge and make these things happen
[02:01:47] and that's why I pointed out that example emergency situation you know it's not it's not the debate time
[02:01:55] time lead back to the book the corpsman was still working on settled but another Marine came up
[02:02:00] corpsman says he's okay got knocked out as all I said good now at this point he's still trying
[02:02:14] to find out where the sniper is and so he decides he's gonna stand up and make himself a cardet
[02:02:21] and and said hey guys when I stand up look and see if he's seen him also flash he gets up
[02:02:25] no one sees him and finally they do start calling in the fire onto this village and we'll go to the
[02:02:36] book now the first rants round slammed in beautiful to watch the red burst and then the firework
[02:02:42] streamers of burning phosphorus splashing out from the burst you knew it must have been different
[02:02:46] at the other end a preview of hell one hut was hit directly it was on fire another hut started to burn
[02:02:54] phosphorus and splashed out and now someone came out running I thought it looked like a man
[02:03:01] but at this distance you couldn't tell he was in a long white garment the platoon sergeant shouted
[02:03:06] in my ear do we fire no hold it hold your fire them chinks sometimes they dress up like that maybe
[02:03:14] white stuff over their uniforms I know just hold it more huts were burning and another figure
[02:03:22] and white spurned out in fell then the robe began to burn from another hut came two more figures
[02:03:27] in white and not the khaki of chinese uniforms they ran fast and bent low zigzagging across the
[02:03:34] central clearing of the village them's chinks lieutenant women don't run like that yeah I said
[02:03:41] there were half a dozen people running now through the village all in white one of them on fire all
[02:03:46] sprinting away from us toward the chinese lines one was carrying something it could be rifle it could
[02:03:52] be a furl the umbrella it could be anything lieutenant Jesus let us fire that's a weapon okay sergeant
[02:04:00] I said fire at will the bars rip off automatic fire heavy and fast two of the villagers fell right
[02:04:08] away one trying to get up and then falling again you could see the bar fire kicking up dust around him
[02:04:13] then a white phosphorous shell burst right in front of him we couldn't see him anymore through
[02:04:18] this fire and smoke the whole village every hut was a flame now the bars fired and a white
[02:04:26] clad figure fell I could see three or more or four of them running away and one of them was on fire
[02:04:33] behind me in a trench in the trench someone yelled Christ we're killing women I whipped around
[02:04:40] who said they're women how do you know a marine stared at me his face was twisted and I didn't know
[02:04:47] them's women you can see the dresses you can't shoot women they're men I shouted at this
[02:04:53] distance you can't tell me they're women not the way they run the bars kept firing nearly
[02:04:59] shutting out the fire light fire flight up at two marie no and you can't tell me they're men the
[02:05:05] marine said not shouting now but still staring he looked as if he were going to jump me
[02:05:11] I looked at him trying to look absolutely confident then I turned back to the platoon sergeant
[02:05:16] keep firing their soldiers Chinese soldiers I was not sure of this not sure of anything but I knew
[02:05:24] the probabilities and I also knew I was scared from playing target so when he got up and walked
[02:05:30] in front of them he was he was shaking up from doing that I made the decision to fire and I couldn't
[02:05:35] back off now because the marine just as scary as I was was yelling at me he was guessing that's all
[02:05:41] I continued to kneel there not really seeing anything anymore not really focusing they ran like
[02:05:46] men dammit women didn't run like that behind me the marine was still there I could sense him
[02:05:53] without turning I said go back to your post if you're all that worry don't fire you don't have to
[02:05:58] fire there was a sort of sob behind me in a scurrying movement I felt funny kneeling there with
[02:06:05] my back to him the marine was shook armed he could shoot me right here I forced myself to stay where I
[02:06:12] was then there was another sound as the marine crawled away killer he risked whispered
[02:06:17] or horsely as if through tears then he was gone and that that situation is actually not it doesn't
[02:06:31] it doesn't get there's no closure in that situation he doesn't find out doesn't get resolved
[02:06:35] in the book he does they leave they hit the village they did cause their distraction and then they
[02:06:40] leave and he never really goes one way or the other and saying or never finds out he suspected they
[02:06:46] were that they were men but he never finds out and that's you know obviously one young marine thought
[02:06:53] they were women he thought they were men no one really knows for sure in war is hell now the next thing
[02:07:03] that happens is Brady actually um uh Brady and Mac they create like a a they're own little special
[02:07:11] unit and they to go out the traveling light not traveling so much gear and they're going to go out
[02:07:19] and smaller units they're going to be do little special operations things and they're planning
[02:07:24] to go with them of course well finally it comes time to go out in operation and the kernel says
[02:07:32] oh yes Alan one more thing new neither you or Brady goes I'm not sending officer on six man
[02:07:37] patrols pick your best sergeant to run them so now Mac he puts an op an argument says no man let me go
[02:07:43] no sir let me go nope not gonna do it so eventually the guys go out on this little operation you
[02:07:49] know little special operations mission to infiltrate enemy lines back to the book 30 minutes after
[02:07:54] they went out no longer there was an explosion in front of lines Mac jumped up up bang his head
[02:08:00] against the overhead logs oh damn it a mine a lousy mine they hit a mine we knew it was a mine
[02:08:08] they weren't out far enough to have hit chinks not yet
[02:08:13] of all the stinking luck it was midnight before we got them all in Mac and I went out with some
[02:08:19] rifleman and brought them back there were three hit the sergeant lost a leg Mac walked all the way
[02:08:25] back with the stretchers talking them all the way trying to comfort them saying he was sorry it was
[02:08:29] them not him the Marines even the sergeant doped up and lashed to a stretcher kept telling Mac it was
[02:08:35] all right no one could have helped it it was just bad luck the Colonel disbanded Mac's outfit the
[02:08:42] next day he was understanding saying it wasn't Mac's fault or minds or anyone's that it might have
[02:08:48] happened with any patrol he sent out bigger small he was just rotten luck no one knew where the
[02:08:54] damn minds were no one could help it and the reason I put that in there is just to think about
[02:09:04] like they disbanded this unit that unit might have a huge impact right they might have started
[02:09:08] doing really good things they might start to break through the lines or could have all kinds of
[02:09:11] good stuff could happen but it just got shut down immediately I'm not saying that was right
[02:09:14] wrong to me it's actually wrong but but it's it's the risk right and if you're in a leadership position
[02:09:23] and you take a risk and you get smacked on your first attempt that doesn't necessarily prove
[02:09:30] you wrong you might want to saddle up again and try something again maybe assess it but these are
[02:09:35] minds you know there's minds all over the place the guys walked into a mind there's like nothing it's random
[02:09:40] and that's one of the pressures of being in a leadership position is you're going to take these
[02:09:47] risks and even when things go wrong you got to press through you know you got to keep doing
[02:09:54] them and I definitely experience that I mean your body we're we're getting you know we had
[02:10:01] guys get wounded early they mean they weren't we weren't seals were not taking a lot of casualties
[02:10:06] in Iraq in 2005 2004 2003 then all of a sudden we're taking casualties and we're doing different
[02:10:14] types of operations we're going out the daytime we're getting really risky stuff and so for me
[02:10:21] to be said okay well we took you know we had a guy get wounded bad we're not going to do this anymore
[02:10:26] that would have been such a wrong answer for me to to have and the chain of command and anybody
[02:10:31] to have that attitude would have been wrong yeah kind of seems like that if they did have that attitude
[02:10:37] do it seem kind of natural just because you know you get you get stung for sure they can definitely
[02:10:44] happen I mean it happens in business people take some risk and you can just have bad luck in
[02:10:48] in situations it happens it fights sometimes for instance you got a great guy that you know
[02:10:55] you got a good wrestler that's going to get a good striker and of course the wrestler goes okay
[02:10:59] I'm gonna go out and take him down well there's a chance that you get caught with a knee on your
[02:11:02] shot and you get knocked out does that mean you I'm never going to shoot again that's the wrong answer
[02:11:07] you gotta go with your strikes yeah now this one they're preparing for another mission
[02:11:19] on to go out on another mission and this mission it's it's it's on a hill called the yoke
[02:11:25] a little a little terrain feature and they're getting ready to go out they got another night
[02:11:31] before they leave and here's back to the book I didn't fall asleep immediately I kept yawning
[02:11:37] but didn't let sleep didn't come that was nerves you never knew when you went out through the
[02:11:44] lines you never really knew and for the first time I began thinking about road being rotated home
[02:11:50] it was obvious that I was never going to become a rear echelon pogue that's so long as I was in
[02:11:55] Korea I would be with a rifle battalion on the line now I had nearly seven months in and it
[02:12:01] not gone and had not many more to go two months maybe three or four tops now I was going on
[02:12:10] patrol as I done that first tour when I was scared because I didn't know anything now I knew a lot
[02:12:18] and I was still scared so as attitude is not he's he's still scared and it's interesting too
[02:12:29] you know he says he's not going to be a rear echelon pogue right he says as apto and
[02:12:32] take oh you can go in the back no he's he's even though he's scared he's staying on the line
[02:12:38] now they're out approaching the the yoke they're heading up the slopes of the yoke this hill
[02:12:45] back to the book the first explosion was so shocking we thought we'd set off we'd thought we'd
[02:12:50] set it off ourselves and wondered why we were so stupid and noisy someone must have trip the
[02:12:54] mind some point man got it then there became the rip of burp guns from above and I realized it
[02:13:01] wasn't a mind but a grenade there were chinks up there I looked around rabble was nearest to me
[02:13:08] it was his first firefight rabble you okay great lieutenant I didn't think we'd be this lucky the
[02:13:15] first time out well that was a healthy positive attitude so this guy's out of his first first
[02:13:21] operation rabble they get they're starting to get crushed with grenades now that there's up ahead of
[02:13:30] them they keep hearing machine gun firing grenades back to the book a Marine crawled over to us he was
[02:13:35] bloody two but I couldn't see where he was hit he talked fast excited but he didn't seem badly hurt
[02:13:40] could be able to make probably less we got up to the wire and then we when he started getting through
[02:13:45] it they hit us with the grenades they got grenades up the ass they was throwing them down and we
[02:13:50] was throwing them back that's how Mr. Roe got it he caught a grenade it went off he's an eye he's
[02:13:56] shy and eye and it looks like some fingers how many dead have we got just the point man so far
[02:14:02] unless some of these hit guys croaked but we got lots of wounded just about everyone picked up
[02:14:08] something in the wire so they're getting basically attacked with grenades up there and this is
[02:14:14] and we talked about grenade battles when we talked about some of the world war one stuff but this
[02:14:20] guys are catching grenades and throwing them back but that's just just getting after it fall on I don't
[02:14:26] know what else to say so now what they use they call in fire they call in their own fire the 105's 105
[02:14:34] artillery stay low the 105's are coming in they shuddle in very loud to smash into the hill
[02:14:40] sides above us I could feel the yolk jerk under me I thought maybe I should pray and I started to
[02:14:46] hail marries but I never finished one short as they were I would start and then another three shells
[02:14:51] would come and over me and bang into the hill and shake me like a rat my body was trying to absorb
[02:14:56] the shock and I forgot where I was in the prayer and had to start again I stopped watching the
[02:15:01] shells come it was too much watching them and worrying and I just laid there as flat as I could
[02:15:05] my dirt in the face my my face in the dirt shoulders hunched and my next screw down tight between them
[02:15:12] trying to squeeze me more more of me into the helmet shells came in like that for maybe three or
[02:15:18] four minutes you couldn't really judge time it had no meaning in a situation like that
[02:15:24] dirt fell likely lightly on us feeling wonderful being only dirt and pebbles and not hot metal
[02:15:30] then the gun secured I think that short one there's one of the round's fell short I think that
[02:15:35] short one shook the gunners up to if they're four observers saw it my body was now on the radio
[02:15:42] give us machine guns on that crest again now the two guns were resumed their chatter
[02:15:47] with McCarthy shouting keep your heads down and poured on and then the McCarthy yelled orders to
[02:15:55] the Marines within hearing on three we go one two we were all up and running all of us
[02:16:02] rabble next to me running uphill but not feeling the grade or being winded or leg weary just
[02:16:06] sprinting up there were a reans there were Marines all around me some of us some of the wounded
[02:16:12] must be coming with us going up a second time I didn't recognize anyone but rabble but didn't
[02:16:17] it didn't matter we were attacking yoke the yoke together in daylight assaulting a hill
[02:16:23] and we were going to get there I fired without aiming just fired vaguely towards the crests of
[02:16:29] the hill it felt good to be running and firing I fired again around me there was shouting I picked
[02:16:35] up the shout no prisoners I yelled no prisoners kill them all that's what I was shouting what the
[02:16:42] others were shouting everyone took it up now everyone near me anyways it was stupid shouting
[02:16:48] stuff like that my job was to get prisoners dead chinks couldn't help anyone but it just seemed
[02:16:54] like the thing to shout at the moment and since it felt good I kept shouting it and so did the
[02:17:00] others no prisoners now when they get a little bit closer up on the hill now I could see grenades in
[02:17:08] the air one grenade seemed to be trailing something tied up with rags I couldn't understand that
[02:17:14] our grenade went off right in front of me stinging both my hands in face dirt it was just dirt
[02:17:19] fragments of grenades would have been hot I didn't feel anything beyond the stinging so I couldn't
[02:17:24] have been hit I fired again more grenades were in the air more going off to both sides and above me
[02:17:30] a burp gun ripped off a quick quick burst I looked around another grenade exploded in front of me
[02:17:36] then one behind I still didn't feel anything pull back of voice came from below it sounded like
[02:17:43] my cardee pull back get out of here so they can't quite get it together to take the hill those
[02:17:51] guys are dug in and they're throwing so many grenades that the guys have to retreat I moved along the
[02:17:59] flister now they get back they get to a little position where they can take a quick uh muster I moved
[02:18:05] along the file of men and then we stopped at the little no with a machine gunners and set up
[02:18:10] my cardee was jotting something does notebook later he figured out 64 of us had been on patrol
[02:18:16] with 48 actually going up the yoke and 32 of us have been hit heavy back to the book I don't know
[02:18:28] how anyone who hasn't been shot at up close in a real firefight can possibly understand how good
[02:18:35] you feel after word men have been hurt and killed the fight has been won or lost but there is
[02:18:44] only one truly significant fact that you are still alive that you had not been killed later
[02:18:51] I was sure I would mourn the dead in the damaged but not now if you were not truly happy at a moment
[02:18:58] like this when you just come down off the line walking perhaps you never would be happy
[02:19:07] and then he goes on and this is this is this is the crux of this story by now they seem to
[02:19:14] figured out about the grenades that come out us looking like they were wrapped in rags
[02:19:19] someone brought in one that didn't explode it was in an old sock the chinks tried to increase the
[02:19:24] explosive effect of the grenades by putting them in old socks full of black powder
[02:19:30] but the chinks outsmarted themselves doing it the extra charge just blew the grenades to pieces
[02:19:36] not in a nicely sized fragments that could kill you that's why so many of us were hit but not
[02:19:41] badly the fragments were too small well you fought and you learned we heard from division that
[02:19:49] row would make it he was on the guys that was wounded they put him up for a navy cross and he was going home
[02:19:54] the other badly hit man didn't die either only the point man the first marine hit was dead all that
[02:20:00] firing all that fighting all those people hit and one marine was dead and I couldn't swear
[02:20:06] to it any of the chinks were dead they got real lucky that's an area back to the book no
[02:20:17] one i knew who'd been there long enough missed the winter but this fighting in the heat possessed
[02:20:22] its own dimension of horror you could see the wounds see what killed people the explicit manner of
[02:20:29] death and injury a leg severed at the knee a mangled arm how startingly white a man's ribs looked
[02:20:37] sticking out from under a flack jacket the pink at the center splintered ends with little bits of
[02:20:43] meat attached all winter you were so muffled in clothes layers and layers swaddled against the
[02:20:49] cold that a man could be all shot to pieces literally sieved but unless you were a corpsman you
[02:20:55] didn't have to look at the broken bones and the torn flesh and see the blood pulsing from
[02:20:59] arteries and veins the bodies were just as hurt just as broken but it happened under a couple pairs
[02:21:05] of pants and an oversized parka men died more neatly in the winter more modestly covered instead
[02:21:12] of naked and have seen the rip the part those heavy clothes gave death a certain muffled
[02:21:19] discretion a man could die in decency after the yoke i thought harder and longer about the accident
[02:21:30] of battle the heads are tail of combat this wasn't the ignorant fear those first weeks of war
[02:21:38] i knew too much now to be frightened by everything and too much ever to turn smug
[02:21:44] yet combat was still a great mystery mingled in fear and exaltation a sense of accomplishment
[02:21:52] offset by neurotic guilt sheer joy at coming through a firefight and nauseating terror
[02:22:01] wanting to flee the battle you were drawn to its furious center no one who had not thought could
[02:22:08] possibly imagine the contradictions or the nuances some fled battle and others embraced it that
[02:22:16] was the enigma i was one of those torn in both directions that caught me of war
[02:22:24] coming at you from james brady now it starts looking like he's going to get rotated out
[02:22:34] back to the book there were rumors i wasn't going to be there much longer that if there were a big
[02:22:39] summer offensive as colonel Gregory kept hinting i wasn't going to be in it i had mixed feelings
[02:22:44] about that most Marines did i guess you didn't want to be a rear echelon pogue you wanted to be
[02:22:49] with a line outfit but once you'd seen combat and lost people and had the usual clothes calls
[02:22:55] for most of us that was sufficient back out and heard the rumors too they say you can extend
[02:23:04] if you want put in for another three months if you do it today they'd give me a rifle company
[02:23:10] why mac just why this was dumb and being stubborn and i was angry at mac for saying it
[02:23:17] mac screwed up his face as he did when he was thinking hard and being serious about something
[02:23:23] Jim having a good company a good company like dog was when chaffy had it that's the culmination of
[02:23:29] everything we've done out here being a platoon leader is a wonderful but i've done that
[02:23:34] being an exec or on the staff this way is nothing i've wanted a company since i was a scared
[02:23:41] replacement pfc on okanawa and all the time at vmi i kept thinking about it sure i'll extend
[02:23:50] if i can get a company i'd never forgive myself if i let it slip what's three months nothing
[02:23:56] not when you put it up against commanding a company of the best soldiers in the world
[02:24:03] the words may have been corny but not the way mac said them
[02:24:10] and sure enough mac does go ahead and volunteer to stay on board and do another tour as a company commander
[02:24:19] and brady gets orders and he had to um and here is brady on the ship
[02:24:29] getting ready ahead home i lay in the birth and join the novelty of electric light
[02:24:34] and the sheets and the pillow and the tiny and the shiny white paint of the ceiling just a few
[02:24:40] feet above me even the rows of rivets were strange and wonderful simple joys
[02:24:47] i was very tired and now i could sleep with no one waking me to go outside and be shot at
[02:24:55] i guess most people were anxious to get home but i hope for a long crossing
[02:25:00] a leisure transition from one life to another
[02:25:07] my life would my name would never be recalled as one of those who changed the direction of the war
[02:25:14] but no one could take away my memory i lay near sleep thinking about the war and how i would not
[02:25:23] have missed it not for anything war gave you a perspective about things
[02:25:30] even painted ceilings and orderly rows of little bolts
[02:25:34] i used to read how old soldiers sometimes went back
[02:25:45] to walk over the ground they even had organized tours meant from world war one going back to
[02:25:51] flanders to trace where the trenches had been where they had crouched and fired where their friends had
[02:25:56] died tours from men from the second war revisiting normandy and walking the beaches seeing again
[02:26:02] mont mont maccasino and places in the pacific i knew i would never go back to Korea
[02:26:11] never sign up for no soldiers tour i didn't want to see the hills again or feel the cold or
[02:26:16] hear the wind out of Siberia moaning i didn't want to disturb the dead
[02:26:23] for all the fire fights for all the swagger i now permitted myself i knew how raw i still was as a
[02:26:31] soldier and as a man i wondered whether anyone ever became really good at war
[02:26:38] an unnatural act killing and trying to kill at that was what i had been trying to do since last
[02:26:44] November when on this very first day here in the first hour i made my peace with god
[02:26:54] now i had a lifetime to ponder the mystery of who lived and who died but even as i lay near
[02:26:59] sleep in that crisp clean bunk i knew it was an ability or courage that had gotten me through
[02:27:05] as much as extraordinary good fortune i was warm and safe and alive and i had been neither incompetent
[02:27:16] nor a coward to be 23 years old and alive seemed a miracle such i would never know again
[02:27:24] no matter how long i lived then i was asleep to dream of ordinary things
[02:27:34] without significance rolled by the vibration and easy motion of the sea and did not realize
[02:27:42] the ship was moving out with the war drifting slowly a stern
[02:27:47] and the epilogue of the book which i'm going to close with
[02:27:57] he gets home and settles back in and then he gets notified by the marine corps that they
[02:28:10] have his footlocker had been shipped back from Korea back to the book while it was still
[02:28:16] summer the marine corps notified me my footlocker had been shipped and i could pick it up a
[02:28:20] grand central station my brother who is 18 and on his way to seminary drove over to help me with it
[02:28:27] it was stored in the depose seller down there where they held freight and kept lost luggage
[02:28:33] and such i handed a paper to the employee of the rail road and he led us
[02:28:39] deeper into the seller there along with the lost baggage and my footlocker were the coffins of the dead
[02:28:50] from Korea stacked and tidy each with its american flag neatly lashed on
[02:28:59] like mac and samonus and captain chaffee and me
[02:29:03] they too were home
[02:29:26] so
[02:29:26] here we are living our lives
[02:29:41] safe and warm and alive
[02:29:46] and we need to be thankful for these sacrifices that these veterans made
[02:30:00] and as i always say we need to make sure we remember
[02:30:04] these sacrifices and that we need to live a life that honors their sacrifices
[02:30:20] then beyond that let's make sure we learn from what they went through
[02:30:27] we learn from their experiences from men like brady and men like chaffee and Princeton and Mac Allen
[02:30:42] let us be their students
[02:30:47] let us learn from their
[02:30:49] to the rich and let us be better
[02:31:01] better because of their knowledge and because of their sacrifices
[02:31:06] let us be better
[02:31:07] and let's make sure that we never ever forget these men
[02:31:18] and this brutal savage freezing war
[02:31:33] and that goes looks like going along on that one
[02:31:46] yeah so i don't think we're going to have time for
[02:31:51] any Q&A
[02:31:55] but perhaps you could take a moment while i decompress over here
[02:32:00] and you could talk about possible ways that if somebody would like to support this podcast
[02:32:08] now they might be able to do that yeah sure
[02:32:12] yeah a little bit of a rough transition i respect that but that being said
[02:32:19] i'm going to talk about on it like we always do i kind of feel like we haven't talked as much about on it as
[02:32:27] maybe we should or maybe we have been i don't know that being said i got
[02:32:33] another thing warrior bars the jalapeno one you're proving them i'm about to they didn't come in yet

[02:34:57] to your cognitive performance is pretty high your satisfaction of it maybe because alphabrain too
[02:35:06] it's not like one of these ones that they're like hey let me uh let me get these herbs and i
[02:35:12] heard good things about these herbs so let's throw it in there and hopefully your brain will work
[02:35:16] better it's not like that like they they put it through um and you can read about it on the website
[02:35:20] i'm gonna butcher that to action you're not gonna say rigorous scientific testing or anything like that
[02:35:25] it is yeah i'll say it but you know they they have the actual but it's like the legitimate
[02:35:31] kind test you know like double blind people like that kind of a lot of times they don't do the
[02:35:36] placebo test and the placebo effect is a big component of why a lot of stuff works that's
[02:35:43] a fact so if if you're trying to test something you gotta do that placebo test you know so you
[02:35:48] give some people i just has sugar and see if they react to it but you make and believe that they take
[02:35:53] the real thing you're like okay you guys are gonna take the real thing and then someone
[02:35:56] had the you know the placebo or all of them or whatever i don't know exactly how they do the test but
[02:36:00] it it basically filters out the fakers i mean it's wrong to call the placebo effect
[02:36:07] fakers but it's basically you believe it so your body kind of you know the
[02:36:11] yeah combination of the placebo's real yeah right placebo's totally really really yes but
[02:36:16] alphabran is like past that test okay so they basically test well i think it passes
[02:36:23] to be straight up proven yeah but even if you're to be like then maybe it's just a
[02:36:27] plastic for me yeah yeah right or like it worked for me but it won't work for me they take like
[02:36:33] the do some puzzles at speed and do it without it yeah i didn't test it like that yeah
[02:36:38] or i tested when i do the podcast so yeah i take it like the night before i'm gonna do the
[02:36:42] podcast i take it and then the morning i'll take it and then i'll take one more before it's good
[02:36:46] evening i go time yeah yeah yeah see and that's good you know but that's because i can't
[02:36:51] i can't play around bro we need to bring it here i need to bring it that's podcast now but
[02:36:58] that that's that's what's called an anecdotal report on it that's not like you know scientific
[02:37:03] thing because there's all these other factors what if your mindset gets into a great mindset anyway
[02:37:08] you know because the point the point i'm making is i feel like not like that they actually do
[02:37:13] the test and the results are scientifically proven measureably that it increases your cognitive function
[02:37:21] like memory and like i believe you were good you know we get to get on it literally get on it
[02:37:26] stay on it do this do this stay on it it does sports podcasts yes of course and you get
[02:37:30] just put it on which is dope just put your wallet and you get to take the mint the i'll tell
[02:37:35] you right now the worry was i don't know really what i did without them before yeah now all of a sudden
[02:37:40] you realize and my three year old likes that that's how delicious that's very good yeah yeah they're
[02:37:45] tasty i'm gonna get to all the opinions i don't know if you like the opinions because they might
[02:37:49] be kind of spicy i don't know anyway on it dot com such a 10% off that's it this more stuff on

[02:41:40] excerpts more excerpts bite size juggle McNuggets shareable stuff you made up the name
[02:41:46] dockle McNuggets way no way I hundred percent possibly it's not a good name though because sometimes
[02:41:53] McNuggets first of all it's trademark I'm sure by McNinals yeah I'm sure but we're not doing it
[02:41:59] we're doing a different product I think you're saying it metaphorically sure you know
[02:42:03] oh I'm so there you go YouTube get on it and YouTube thank it's like a circular logic thing
[02:42:11] also the jockel store I mentioned there's also a peril on there if you're into it
[02:42:17] you know some women stuff well I think women are starting to be more and more represented in the store
[02:42:23] you got a few items there oh the little patches the regulation size oh yeah
[02:42:28] regulation color they're in flat dark earth it's the color regulation boom so yeah well crew there's
[02:42:38] some hoodies on there which are pretty cool those go fast man I gotta reordown I guess I guess I
[02:42:43] good yeah I guess you do my wife was wearing her as I was like the other day just the other night
[02:42:47] starting to lip cold I know we'll just say it's the temperatures for those of you and Wisconsin
[02:42:54] echo apologies for saying it was cold here yeah I'm from Koli cold means different things
[02:42:59] different places anyway here in San Diego you got cold my wife was wearing one I was like
[02:43:03] she looked good in it in a casual sort of way so I have some women some good shirts if you like
[02:43:10] literally some good shirts um you'll know what I'm talking about if you look at it you know my jockel store
[02:43:15] dot com if you like something you get a shirt man get an a sticker and a patch boom you're good
[02:43:20] to go any sports fight guys and you get something in return that's cool I guess all of them
[02:43:25] you kind of get something in return so that's cool yeah yeah but yeah that's it boom Christmas coming
[02:43:31] out it's so I know it Christmas coming up I have the reason I'm laughing is because um
[02:43:39] there's one thing that you didn't mention about the shirts and I don't know if you did this purpose
[02:43:42] that you're not purposely but there was one thing that you didn't mention about the shirts that
[02:43:47] you always mentioned about the shirts maybe you've decided not to mention it now and we'll just leave it
[02:43:52] oh oh okay I know what you see yeah are we not gonna mention it the layers and you know what
[02:43:58] god here it is it is true yeah there's some layers on the shirts but sometimes if you don't know
[02:44:04] about the layers here how's this and someone mentioned this before they emailed me um because I think
[02:44:10] you may have realized that talking about the layers kind of takes away the the impact of the layers
[02:44:16] that kind of like you just brought it up now and they're talking about it I think if you go into
[02:44:21] this situation you're going to the situation not knowing those layers and you see the layers I think
[02:44:26] it comes as more of a treat totally more rewarding so from henceforth we shall no longer
[02:44:33] mention or speak of the layers the layers this is it for now on there we out there there will be
[02:44:40] there but people will people will just have to dig in and find the layers on their own discover
[02:44:50] or maybe we'll talk about them again whichever there you go thanks to something I like I like the
[02:44:54] reward being dug for yeah I like that more boom and also hey when you're on Amazon there's a
[02:45:02] couple of things you can get when you click through the store and you go to Amazon there's a couple
[02:45:05] of things that you might be interested in getting they are my they might seem hard to get which
[02:45:10] they kind of are one of the things that you can get is is called well there's a mug that says
[02:45:17] get after it on it which is a good thing to have because it reminds you to get after it and there's
[02:45:22] a little also a little approved stamp of approval from from me actually so it's been approved
[02:45:30] and then you can also get some chocolate which there has been some so somebody finally posted
[02:45:38] the other day they're like oh because I announced that we'll never run out of white to you again
[02:45:42] because I ordered a ton of it and of course we ran out well we actually technically we didn't
[02:45:47] okay we the way Amazon works the stuff shows up there they can only in process so much at
[02:45:55] time so a ton of it showed up there they started in processing it boom so it showed up everyone
[02:46:00] yes sold out but then they in process more you know the next day so what's you're going to see now
[02:46:07] and I apologize for this hopefully I can get this logistical thing smoothed out it's just
[02:46:12] it's taking me some time where they have so much that'll be in process and we will truly
[02:46:18] never want out but what you do right now is if it's sold out just keep looking back because it'll
[02:46:23] come back when they restock at the next day boom they'll have it so we'll get there I apologize
[02:46:29] the tea is awesome it tastes delicious and when you have it you will refuse flat out to drink
[02:46:39] anything else in the world nothing is going to come close you're just going to be like where's my
[02:46:44] where's my chocolate tea strangely when I was drinking it the thing one of the things that I did do
[02:46:51] significantly and I'm talking about the first time when it first came in the first time the fact that
[02:46:57] you made it you know the fact that you contributed to the actual making of the formula of the
[02:47:02] did you like that actually like affected the experience oh you felt you felt like
[02:47:08] isn't there kind of but that makes sense right you know I guess so I think it makes it well
[02:47:14] I guess we spend a lot of time doing this podcast and then you got so it's like when I guess it is
[02:47:19] correct you know why because when I watch one of your videos I feel like I'm like oh that's that's
[02:47:24] echo echo did that yeah yeah yeah that's echo held that camera there so I feel the same
[02:47:31] way that you feel when you crack open a tin or a box of jokawaii teen you grew one up for the for the for the
[02:47:39] team also while your name is on you can get a copy of the book called Extreme Ownership which I wrote
[02:47:50] with my brother life bab and and you know what I got this to say don't be selfish with your knowledge
[02:47:58] don't hold it back and this is this is what people get worried about right because you want to buy it
[02:48:02] for you think a whole bite for my subordinates and a bite for my boss and a bite for my family
[02:48:07] and you think they need to you need to get scared you get scared because what you think is
[02:48:12] people are going to like see right through you and they're going to go oh you read this in that book
[02:48:17] and that's why you're acting this way so you'd rather just not give it to them oh yeah yeah
[02:48:20] I'm telling you do not worry about that here's why when when people have read it and they see you
[02:48:30] acting it they don't get mad they actually go yeah they're taking ownership yes and it starts to get
[02:48:37] that more you get more people on board the program and it makes your everything better so when people
[02:48:45] see extreme ownership when people see when you see people enacting extreme ownership you don't
[02:48:51] get jealous that's not actually if you've read the book you're like broho way to take ownership
[02:48:55] of that man that's awesome I respect that recognize what's happening so don't be afraid
[02:49:02] like you were a few minutes ago to buy this book for your your subordinates is no big deal
[02:49:08] but even see the other thing is we think oh well you know I want to be the guy that came up with a
[02:49:13] plan I'm going to do extreme ownership but I wanted to be mine it is yours it's yours and I didn't
[02:49:20] invent it we just put it out there so grab a hold of it and it's it's a really good gift
[02:49:28] because it's not just going to be a gift but they get and then they don't get anything else from
[02:49:33] it's going to keep giving right give it keep giving all right by the book also we got
