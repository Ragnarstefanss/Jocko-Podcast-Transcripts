[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 170.
[00:00:03] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:06] Good evening, Echo.
[00:00:07] Good evening.
[00:00:08] It is time for some Q&A.
[00:00:10] Okay. It has been a while.
[00:00:12] Yeah.
[00:00:13] It's been a while for sure.
[00:00:15] So let's question.
[00:00:18] Questions from the interwebs.
[00:00:19] Yes indeed.
[00:00:20] As it is.
[00:00:21] Said, okay, first question.
[00:00:23] Jockel.
[00:00:24] I'm taking over leadership of a team of six people.
[00:00:27] Two, I know and four, I don't.
[00:00:30] When you've taken over leadership, did you want give a group talk?
[00:00:35] Two, meet with each individual and three.
[00:00:38] What did you say?
[00:00:40] Good question.
[00:00:41] Yes, obviously give a group talk.
[00:00:44] That's affirmative.
[00:00:45] You get everyone together.
[00:00:46] Hey guys, my name is Bill.
[00:00:50] I came from this place.
[00:00:52] I'm here to take over.
[00:00:54] Now, there's a, some judgment calls that you have to make.
[00:00:59] Because you're going to introduce yourself.
[00:01:02] But if you're taking over a well functioning team, then guess what?
[00:01:05] You're not going into revamp everything immediately.
[00:01:09] Because everything's going fine.
[00:01:10] So you're, hey, I'm happy to be working with you guys.
[00:01:12] Looking forward to it.
[00:01:13] I know you guys have a great reputation.
[00:01:15] Glad to be a part of the team.
[00:01:16] Awesome.
[00:01:17] If you have any questions, let me know.
[00:01:19] I'm here.
[00:01:20] That's easy.
[00:01:21] If you're taking over a team that's not working well.
[00:01:23] Like there's problems.
[00:01:24] And that's why if somebody got fired, and that's why you're coming in there, you might need to address some of those things.
[00:01:28] Hey, listen, I know things have been a little off track.
[00:01:30] I'm going to look at what's going on.
[00:01:32] I'm going to take input from you guys.
[00:01:33] We probably need to make some changes.
[00:01:35] We're going to do it together as a team.
[00:01:36] That's what we're moving from here.
[00:01:38] We need to get back to where we're supposed to be.
[00:01:41] Boom, something like that.
[00:01:42] And again, there's going to be people on that team that have been busting their ass and working really hard.
[00:01:46] And if you go in there and just to spare it, everyone, they're, you're going to start off on the wrong foot.
[00:01:50] So, yeah, have keep it pretty broad when you meet the whole group.
[00:01:54] Hey, this is who I am.
[00:01:55] This is where I came from.
[00:01:56] This is what I'm looking forward to.
[00:01:58] All that stuff.
[00:02:00] And then yes, do you meet with people individually?
[00:02:02] Absolutely.
[00:02:03] You go around.
[00:02:04] You meet with them.
[00:02:05] And when you, what are you talking about?
[00:02:06] You're talking about them.
[00:02:08] You're talking about them.
[00:02:09] You want to know about them.
[00:02:10] You want to know who they, they are.
[00:02:12] You want to know what their, what their family situation is.
[00:02:15] What their interests are, what's going on.
[00:02:17] How they feel about the transitions that have been taken place a little bit of that stuff.
[00:02:20] It's not about you.
[00:02:21] It's about them.
[00:02:22] So go.
[00:02:23] Yes, and talk to everyone.
[00:02:24] Take notes.
[00:02:25] Maybe not right in front of them.
[00:02:27] So you look like a nerd.
[00:02:29] But, you know, afterward you go, hey, Bill has three kids.
[00:02:32] His wife also works at the company.
[00:02:34] He's interested in soccer and basketball.
[00:02:37] Whatever you just take those notes.
[00:02:40] You know, it's actually good before you take some,
[00:02:44] it's an over a situation.
[00:02:47] If you already familiarize yourself with us,
[00:02:49] you look at the maybe the HR website at your company has a picture of everyone.
[00:02:53] So you kind of know who they are.
[00:02:55] Give you less stuff to remember.
[00:02:56] So there's that.
[00:02:58] Make good first impression.
[00:03:01] Don't go in there.
[00:03:02] Looking like an idiot.
[00:03:03] Don't go in there thinking that.
[00:03:05] Oh, I just, I'm the boss man.
[00:03:07] So everyone has to bow down.
[00:03:09] And bow down to my superiority.
[00:03:13] No, they're actually mad at you.
[00:03:15] Yeah.
[00:03:16] The thing is they're mad at you.
[00:03:18] So I remember one time I was taking over a small element.
[00:03:22] And one of my friends was a part of the element.
[00:03:26] And I went in, like 20 guys.
[00:03:29] I went in, hey.
[00:03:30] And I walked in, but I just had a notebook with like five things.
[00:03:34] I wanted to talk to them about.
[00:03:36] And as soon as I walked in, I opened up my notebook and he's said something like,
[00:03:40] You brought a notebook, you're always squared away.
[00:03:43] That's why you're putting in charge.
[00:03:44] That's why your put in charge.
[00:03:45] So like just a little impression of, hey man, I'm, I take this stuff seriously.
[00:03:51] And I would say overall, your main goal when you're meeting your team,
[00:03:54] when you're meeting the individuals on your team,
[00:03:57] is you are looking to build relationships with the people on the team.
[00:04:01] That's what your goal is because when you build these relationships,
[00:04:04] that's going to make your team stronger, et cetera.
[00:04:07] Yeah.
[00:04:08] Remember the time when you were on yoga,
[00:04:10] Rog and the first time when he was like, hey, you're the only ones who's ever brought a note pad.
[00:04:15] You know, and you're like, just trying to be prepared.
[00:04:17] Just trying to be prepared.
[00:04:18] It was good.
[00:04:19] Okay, so there's anything, you know, you know,
[00:04:21] your outfit comes up.
[00:04:22] You don't want it to slip your mind.
[00:04:24] Yeah, yeah, that's funny.
[00:04:26] And I'm trying to imagine being a worker,
[00:04:29] and you know, when you get a new manager, you know, whatever new boss.
[00:04:32] You know, the come in.
[00:04:34] Yeah, if they were like having an individual meeting,
[00:04:36] I would dig it, and then, but if they're like taking notes, I'd be like, wait,
[00:04:39] where are you taking notes?
[00:04:40] Like, well, how are you going to use this?
[00:04:41] Yeah, you know, against me later or something like that?
[00:04:43] No, sort of, hey, is it all?
[00:04:44] Hey, man, how's it going?
[00:04:45] How long you've been here for?
[00:04:46] Oh, I've been here for four years.
[00:04:48] Oh, cool.
[00:04:49] Do you, you married?
[00:04:50] Yeah, yeah, I got two kids.
[00:04:52] Oh, that's awesome.
[00:04:53] That's awesome.
[00:04:53] How long you've been married for?
[00:04:54] Oh, six years.
[00:04:55] Like that.
[00:04:56] You're getting no the person.
[00:04:57] If I go in there and I go, how long you've been here?
[00:04:59] And you're like six years and I write it down.
[00:05:01] Yeah, right.
[00:05:01] And then I say, what, what is your primary function here at the team?
[00:05:06] You know what I mean?
[00:05:07] If you just jump right into that, we're not looking to build relationship.
[00:05:09] We're just looking to find out how I can use you.
[00:05:11] Yeah, that's what it feels like.
[00:05:12] Yeah, I mean, you said it like, you're like, oh, long you've been married.
[00:05:15] You said it like that, no, man, doesn't matter how you say, you could say it
[00:05:18] the most nice polite way ever.
[00:05:20] And when you write it down, it's kind of like, bro, like,
[00:05:23] you're going to take all this information and sort of do some sort of
[00:05:27] evaluation for me.
[00:05:29] You know, kind of, it's what it feels like.
[00:05:31] It does feel like that.
[00:05:32] That's why I specifically said when you're having a personal conversation with a person
[00:05:35] that you're meeting for the first time, you're not scratching it into a
[00:05:38] note pad.
[00:05:39] Yeah.
[00:05:40] Now that being said, if the guy says, you know what?
[00:05:42] I've noticed some things here around here that need changing.
[00:05:44] You go really hold on a second.
[00:05:46] Yeah.
[00:05:47] Let me break out my notebook here and take notes on what you're about to say.
[00:05:50] Yeah, that's a dance.
[00:05:51] You know, if you, yes, like when you get a micromanager, you're working for a
[00:05:54] micromanager, bring a notebook.
[00:05:55] They see you write and stuff down.
[00:05:56] They think they're like happy.
[00:05:58] Yeah, trick anyone.
[00:05:59] Yeah, because when you're writing down there stuff, that's how it slips the
[00:06:03] script.
[00:06:04] It makes it like, oh, yeah.
[00:06:05] Yeah, he's taking notes to support you.
[00:06:06] Yeah, I'm saying, yeah, yeah, I think he's going to evaluate my opinion.
[00:06:09] Oh, yeah, that's good.
[00:06:10] Well, well, and there with the notebook.
[00:06:12] It's like the doctor.
[00:06:13] You know, when you go to the doctor and he's asking, oh, yeah, like all the
[00:06:16] stuff you see him writing down, you know, in your chart, whatever, even though
[00:06:20] a doctor situation is good, because you want him to go evaluate it later, whatever,
[00:06:23] you don't give you cure, but same deal, man, same deal,
[00:06:26] you're with those notes.
[00:06:28] Yeah, my saint.
[00:06:29] Jack, Jack, that goes not prepared for you to take notes on a week.
[00:06:33] Not with, well, now my personal stuff, how long you've been married?
[00:06:36] Oh, nine years old, keep nine years.
[00:06:38] It will grab.
[00:06:39] You're in your next question.
[00:06:42] Next question.
[00:06:43] I'm a sergeant, and I want to know how to deal with my men in a way without
[00:06:47] punishment, but still make them better for next time.
[00:06:50] Okay, here's something for you.
[00:06:53] Punishment is actually the last straw in how you deal with people that you're in
[00:07:00] charge of.
[00:07:01] In fact, I will tell you this, if I ever had to punish someone, when I had to
[00:07:06] administer punishment on my troops, I always felt that I had to, somewhere
[00:07:12] I had done some wrong, right?
[00:07:14] Like, even if a guy got in trouble out in town, got drunk, got in a fight,
[00:07:19] did something stupid.
[00:07:20] I would still look at that and think to myself, how could I have allowed this guy
[00:07:25] to not realize what a disaster it is, how much trouble he's going to get in,
[00:07:29] what kind of international incident he's going to cause, how that's going to
[00:07:32] hurt us in the team strategically, all those things.
[00:07:34] How did I let that happen?
[00:07:36] So, dolling out punishment is not optimal.
[00:07:40] I mean, you've pretty much, you've pretty much made a mistake if you have to
[00:07:44] punish people because if you're doing, if you're being a good leader, people are
[00:07:47] doing what you want them to do.
[00:07:49] There's no reason for punishment.
[00:07:51] So, that's what you should not be looking to punish and just like I just said, you should be looking to build relationships.
[00:07:57] You should be looking to show people a better way of doing things, a way that's more
[00:08:03] smooth and more efficient and doesn't disrupt what the team efforts are.
[00:08:08] You've got to explain to people why they're doing what they're doing.
[00:08:11] This is all stuff, right?
[00:08:12] This is to explain why things are done a certain way.
[00:08:16] Explain how it impacts the team, explain how it impacts them.
[00:08:20] That's all so important.
[00:08:23] You've got to have people rehearse in, in retrain because now I'm talking to, how do you get people to do the right thing, right?
[00:08:33] Without punishing them.
[00:08:34] So, we're trying to avoid punishment.
[00:08:36] How do we avoid punishment?
[00:08:38] How do we avoid punishment by people understanding what they're doing, why they're doing what they're doing.
[00:08:42] How do we avoid punishment by setting goals that make sense that are small enough for them to get to?
[00:08:50] And then have fun with the goals and get in the game yourself and show them that you're not perfect.
[00:08:58] And that is what you need to do.
[00:09:00] You need to make every effort to make people understand why they're doing, what they're doing, how they fit into the big picture.
[00:09:10] And when they figure all that stuff out and they're on board, you shouldn't have to punish people.
[00:09:16] You shouldn't have to punish people.
[00:09:19] So, I know it's, yeah, that's what it is.
[00:09:23] You're your sergeant and you want to do it through men, we're away without punishment.
[00:09:26] Well, think of what the mistakes you're making.
[00:09:28] When you're when you're fire team or your, your, your pulltune does something wrong.
[00:09:35] Why did they make that mistake?
[00:09:36] They make the mistake as they wanted to.
[00:09:38] No, they made it because you were a bad leader at that point in time.
[00:09:41] You, what could you do better?
[00:09:43] Hey guys, where, what did you understand?
[00:09:46] Oh, you guys messed up this training operation.
[00:09:49] I'm going to restrict your weekend duty.
[00:09:52] I'm going to restrict you to weekend duty.
[00:09:54] Meaning you can't go out and tell.
[00:09:56] What, what good did I just do?
[00:09:58] Right?
[00:09:59] Are they going to try harder now?
[00:10:01] Right?
[00:10:02] But if you say, hey, listen, guys, we did a bad job.
[00:10:05] I know I must have made a mistake in trying to explain this information to you all,
[00:10:11] because we didn't do what we were supposed to do.
[00:10:14] Let's look, let's dissect this thing.
[00:10:16] As a matter of fact, let's spend Friday night dissecting this thing.
[00:10:19] I'm buying pizza, then we'll sit around the, the sand table and we'll figure out what,
[00:10:25] what we did wrong.
[00:10:26] That's not punishment.
[00:10:28] That has the opposite effect of punishment.
[00:10:31] That has, hey, I'm bringing everyone in because I want to win.
[00:10:34] I want us all to win.
[00:10:36] So that's what you got to do.
[00:10:38] Don't punishment should be punishment should be, I mean, do you have to punish people sometimes?
[00:10:43] Yes, yes you do.
[00:10:45] When they're blatantly out of line when they do something that's blatantly wrong.
[00:10:48] Yeah, you got to drop the hammer on them.
[00:10:50] You got to set the example sometimes.
[00:10:52] How you're not going to get away with this?
[00:10:53] Sometimes that happened in the dreams.
[00:10:55] You know, somebody would do something stupid.
[00:10:57] And the command would just drop the hammer.
[00:11:01] And everyone goes, man, that guy got a DUI and they, you know,
[00:11:05] docked him, they busted him in rank and they pulled him out of his platoon.
[00:11:10] And they're sending him to a, to a fleet billet for two years.
[00:11:13] But you're my god.
[00:11:15] That might make someone think, right?
[00:11:17] You know, maybe I won't step behind the wheel.
[00:11:19] Yeah.
[00:11:20] So sometimes you do have to punish if people do something stupid,
[00:11:23] especially after they've been warned a couple times.
[00:11:25] Yeah.
[00:11:26] But I always look if I have to deliver punishment on my team.
[00:11:30] I made a mistake somewhere.
[00:11:32] I don't like it.
[00:11:33] Yeah.
[00:11:34] Don't they say that like reward and encouragement is like way more powerful than punished.
[00:11:38] Definitely way more powerful.
[00:11:39] Way more powerful.
[00:11:40] For sure.
[00:11:41] Seems like it.
[00:11:42] I've almost never punished people.
[00:11:45] Yeah.
[00:11:46] Yeah.
[00:11:47] But the reason is why did I punish people?
[00:11:49] Because people were doing, weren't doing stupid things.
[00:11:52] They were doing what they were supposed to be doing.
[00:11:54] They were doing.
[00:11:55] Yeah.
[00:11:56] I mean, I probably, I don't even know if I,
[00:11:58] I probably, I think I had like a one or two captains mass where I had to bring somebody in and drop the hammer on them.
[00:12:03] It's because they did dumb stuff.
[00:12:05] Yeah.
[00:12:06] It's like, man, you know what?
[00:12:07] You can't do that.
[00:12:09] I didn't think of it.
[00:12:10] I'm sorry.
[00:12:11] But you can't do that.
[00:12:13] Yeah.
[00:12:14] Pre-persons.
[00:12:15] Yeah.
[00:12:16] Next question.
[00:12:17] Jockel.
[00:12:18] In the discipline equals freedom field manual, the section fear reads.
[00:12:23] How do you overcome fear of failure?
[00:12:26] Step.
[00:12:28] Go.
[00:12:29] But a previous entry reads,
[00:12:32] I don't want you to overcome fear of failure.
[00:12:35] I want you to be afraid of failure.
[00:12:38] Mind the elaborating.
[00:12:40] Yeah.
[00:12:41] Clearly, there's a dichotomy here.
[00:12:42] I know it's my favorite word apparently according to Dean Lister.
[00:12:45] Yes.
[00:12:46] Okay.
[00:12:47] There is a dichotomy here because fear is something good that you should take advantage of.
[00:12:52] So it's kind of good to be afraid because it keeps you on edge.
[00:12:55] It keeps you from slacking.
[00:12:58] It keeps you preparing as much as you possibly can and all that stuff is good.
[00:13:03] But at the same time, yes, if you go too far to the other end of the spectrum, fear gets a hold of you.
[00:13:08] You can't overcome it.
[00:13:09] So you freeze or you cower or you run away and none of those are good reactions.
[00:13:13] So what I obviously failed to communicate well in the book,
[00:13:17] Dispony goes freedom field manual is the dichotomy between these spectrum,
[00:13:24] The spectrum of fear that you can have.
[00:13:26] So if you have no fear whatsoever, no fear.
[00:13:29] Well, guess what?
[00:13:30] You get cocky, you can get arrogant.
[00:13:32] If you have too much fear, you can't even get out of the gate.
[00:13:36] You just freeze, you hesitate.
[00:13:38] So like all dichotomies, you got to balance those two.
[00:13:42] And the way you balance those two is to try and do things that make you feel fear.
[00:13:50] So that way you get used to it, you can overcome it, you can deal with it, you can utilize it.
[00:13:55] If you have a fighter, you have to see fighters that I'll come afraid every time I get in the ring.
[00:14:00] Pretty much everybody.
[00:14:01] Yeah, pretty much everybody.
[00:14:02] I'm afraid because you're afraid you're going to get knocked out, you're afraid this, you're afraid that.
[00:14:06] Frating and losing front of all my family and friends and all that.
[00:14:09] So everyone's afraid.
[00:14:10] So what does that fear do?
[00:14:11] It drives you to train harder.
[00:14:12] Drives you to prepare, drives you to keep your hands up and your chin down.
[00:14:15] When you're in the key to the end of the world, you're going to have to keep your hands up and your chin down.
[00:14:19] When you're in the cage.
[00:14:20] Right.
[00:14:21] So yeah, there's a healthy level of fear.
[00:14:24] It can also get the best of you.
[00:14:27] So keep it balanced.
[00:14:29] Yeah, we talked about this and I think Sam Harris talked about it first.
[00:14:34] First I heard it made a point not to go too deep into it.
[00:14:38] But where, you know, like this, okay, fear, how do you overcome fear, step go.
[00:14:44] Right.
[00:14:45] It's essentially like take action, be brave in the face of fear.
[00:14:48] But if there's no fear, it's kind of like, you're not really being brave.
[00:14:52] You're not, you know, kind of think.
[00:14:53] Well, that's true, too.
[00:14:54] Yeah.
[00:14:55] So consider that notion.
[00:14:56] Right.
[00:14:57] So you say, yeah, I want you to be afraid of failure.
[00:14:59] Oh, yeah, be afraid of failure.
[00:15:00] But you still got a step.
[00:15:01] You still got to go.
[00:15:02] You still got to be brave, you know, kind of thing.
[00:15:04] So they do actually kind of compliment each other really.
[00:15:08] Unless you think like, oh, yeah, overcome fear, meaning like,
[00:15:11] I'm not scared of it anymore.
[00:15:13] It's literally not figured it's always fear.
[00:15:15] It's more, it's less about the fear being, you know, reduced to zero.
[00:15:20] It's more about being brave, training yourself to be brave.
[00:15:23] In brace the fear.
[00:15:24] Yeah.
[00:15:25] In brace the fear.
[00:15:26] And the end.
[00:15:27] So to continue with that thought, in order to embrace the fear, what do you do?
[00:15:31] You step.
[00:15:32] Do you go into it.
[00:15:33] So there you go.
[00:15:34] There's your answer.
[00:15:35] Cool.
[00:15:36] That's a question.
[00:15:37] I was wondering when does standing up for the right thing take precedence
[00:15:41] over avoiding conflict?
[00:15:43] This is something that leaders have to deal with all the time.
[00:15:47] So clearly out of the gate, things that are immoral, unethical, or illegal,
[00:15:51] if you participate, you're guilty.
[00:15:53] That's the way it is.
[00:15:55] Now things that are a matter of opinion, that's where you might have to play.
[00:16:00] The long game, like, maybe you don't want to do something a certain way.
[00:16:04] And if you, but if you think, oh, well,
[00:16:08] I think the jiu-jitsu class warm-ups should be doing these exercises.
[00:16:14] And echo things that should be those exercises.
[00:16:18] So echo these things we should do it this way.
[00:16:20] No, we should do it this way.
[00:16:21] You dig in.
[00:16:22] I dig in.
[00:16:23] Now we, we, end up saying, well, I'm not going to teach the class.
[00:16:25] You know, you end up in these situations.
[00:16:27] Well, what's the big deal?
[00:16:28] What's, you know, what, what I rather do?
[00:16:30] I'd rather play the long game.
[00:16:32] I'd rather say, hey man, can you explain why you do those exercises?
[00:16:34] Oh, here's another exercise cool that I learned.
[00:16:36] Isn't this good for this technique?
[00:16:37] Oh, you know how you like when I do this move?
[00:16:39] This actually helps me do it even though it's just a warm-up move.
[00:16:41] Oh, that's cool.
[00:16:42] We build a little relationship.
[00:16:44] You get to understand me.
[00:16:45] I get to understand you.
[00:16:46] Boom.
[00:16:47] You also need to say, hey, I'm going to incorporate that into our warm-ups.
[00:16:49] So we're going to warm up here, boom.
[00:16:50] There you go.
[00:16:51] Now I understand that that's the right thing, right?
[00:16:54] Because in my mind, I'm thinking, hey,
[00:16:56] if these students need to know this escape,
[00:16:58] it's the right thing to do.
[00:16:59] So I do that.
[00:17:00] So you have to weigh it out.
[00:17:03] Yeah.
[00:17:03] What am I doing to my relationship in this situation?
[00:17:06] If I go along with this, like if you ask me to do nine things that are pretty
[00:17:11] menial and you're my boss and I say, yep, cool, got it boss and no problem.
[00:17:15] And you ask me to do something else.
[00:17:16] It's me.
[00:17:17] Yep, cool, got it boss and no problem.
[00:17:18] Then you ask me to do something else.
[00:17:19] Me, cool, got it boss and no problem.
[00:17:21] Then you ask me to do something that's downright stupid and dangerous.
[00:17:24] And I go, hey, boss, I need to talk about this.
[00:17:26] I'm not sure.
[00:17:27] Can you explain to me why we're doing it this way?
[00:17:28] Because there's a possibility someone can really get hurt.
[00:17:30] You go, oh, well, you've done it.
[00:17:32] In your mind, you're thinking you've done these ten things for me.
[00:17:34] You've done nine things for me.
[00:17:36] You've done seven things for me.
[00:17:37] You did them well.
[00:17:38] You didn't question me.
[00:17:39] Now listen, you have a question.
[00:17:40] You must have a legitimate question.
[00:17:42] That's what we're hoping for.
[00:17:43] That's why we're trying to build relationships.
[00:17:45] Now, all that being said, yes, we're playing along it.
[00:17:49] There are times.
[00:17:51] And this is a really sketchy area to enter into.
[00:17:54] There are times where something that is happening is immoral, unethical,
[00:17:59] or illegal, and you might actually have to kind of go along with it.
[00:18:04] I tried to think of a good example of that.
[00:18:06] And I thought of one, Oscar Schindler from Schindler's List.
[00:18:12] What did this guy do?
[00:18:14] Right?
[00:18:15] This guy was a Nazi.
[00:18:17] He was a Nazi.
[00:18:19] They were exterminating Jews.
[00:18:23] And instead of him standing up and saying,
[00:18:26] this is wrong to exterminate Jews, I protest.
[00:18:29] How long would he have lived if he had done that?
[00:18:31] Thirty seconds.
[00:18:32] Right?
[00:18:33] Oh, you don't think Jews should die cool.
[00:18:35] We're killing you.
[00:18:36] That was that.
[00:18:37] How many people did he save?
[00:18:38] Zero.
[00:18:39] He would negate if one.
[00:18:41] What did he do?
[00:18:42] He played the game.
[00:18:44] He befriended the Nazi leadership.
[00:18:46] He bought them gifts.
[00:18:47] He bribed them.
[00:18:48] He bought them gifts.
[00:18:49] He built relationships with them.
[00:18:50] He ended up being able to move his factory and all this other stuff
[00:18:53] to save a bunch of Jewish people.
[00:18:58] And he even though he knew,
[00:19:01] like he would see them executing people.
[00:19:04] He would see them executing Jews.
[00:19:06] And he knew it was wrong.
[00:19:08] He thought it was wrong.
[00:19:09] He felt it was wrong.
[00:19:10] And if he would have stood up and said,
[00:19:12] hey, what you're doing is wrong,
[00:19:14] then he wouldn't have been able to save anyone.
[00:19:18] He would have been killed himself.
[00:19:20] So even in that situation,
[00:19:24] it's not a guarantee that you need to stand up to do the ethical thing.
[00:19:32] Because perhaps there's a chance you can do the more ethical thing
[00:19:36] by playing the game building relationships.
[00:19:39] Who knows?
[00:19:40] Who knows?
[00:19:41] Maybe if that war went on.
[00:19:42] Maybe he would have said, oh, you know what?
[00:19:43] Maybe he would have risen to a position where he,
[00:19:45] you know, maybe if the Germans would have won.
[00:19:47] And he could have said, hey, you know what?
[00:19:48] The Jewish people are making good workers here.
[00:19:50] I'm going to continue to use them or whatever.
[00:19:52] You know, maybe he built up a whole new, you never know.
[00:19:55] But when you get rid of your influence,
[00:19:59] when you lose your influence,
[00:20:00] because you stand up, it might not be the best move.
[00:20:04] And the thing that you have to wait for this,
[00:20:07] you have to wait with this is you are participating.
[00:20:11] And actually, you know, they say Oscar Schindler felt completely guilty
[00:20:14] because he did participate and he was a part of what was happening.
[00:20:19] He did his best to stop as much as he could,
[00:20:21] but he wish he would have stopped more.
[00:20:23] And, you know, at some point, maybe you see a little six year old girl
[00:20:26] getting shot and you think, you know what?
[00:20:28] I should screw it.
[00:20:31] I should stand in front of that bullet and take that bullet
[00:20:34] for that little girl.
[00:20:35] You know, that's the kind of guilt that he felt.
[00:20:38] So there are times where you really have to wait
[00:20:43] this out.
[00:20:44] And also, I'll tell you, I mean, even in things that aren't this big,
[00:20:48] ethical dilemma, head on conflict is generally not the best way
[00:20:54] to solve problems.
[00:20:56] Most of the time, it's much smarter to maneuver.
[00:21:00] It's much smarter to flank, and it's much smarter to come from another angle.
[00:21:04] And it's much smarter to build allegiance and alliance with people.
[00:21:09] So you can have influence over.
[00:21:11] So you can move them in the right direction.
[00:21:14] Yeah, so almost like, actually straight up,
[00:21:17] where doing the right thing and avoiding conflict is kind of like,
[00:21:22] they're not that opposite, you know,
[00:21:25] where doing the avoiding, you should, and I'm totally just
[00:21:29] interpreting this, trying to do it.
[00:21:32] Avoiding conflict, you should always be essentially trying to avoid conflict
[00:21:36] as far as, maybe not all the time.
[00:21:38] Yeah, but generally speaking, we do a better job.
[00:21:43] Then the outcome is better when we avoid conflict.
[00:21:46] Now, of course, anyone listening to this,
[00:21:49] oh, you take that to extreme.
[00:21:50] This is someone that never stands up for anything.
[00:21:52] Yeah, and that's bad.
[00:21:53] And it's also bad from a leadership perspective.
[00:21:55] If your team is looking at you and they think,
[00:21:58] Jockel never sticks up for us.
[00:22:00] He never gives the boss any pushback.
[00:22:02] So we're just at the whim of this tyrannical boss,
[00:22:05] and Jockel is no buffer to it.
[00:22:07] That's what they see.
[00:22:08] So you can't just be a pushover, but at the same time,
[00:22:11] if you go to your troops and you say,
[00:22:12] hey, listen, guys, here's what's going on.
[00:22:14] The boss has got a lot of ideas right now.
[00:22:17] Some of them are good, some of them not so good.
[00:22:19] But guess what?
[00:22:20] What I'm doing right now, and the reason that we're pushing hard to carry out
[00:22:23] what he's trying to get us to do is to the best of our ability.
[00:22:26] The reason we're doing that is because I'm actually trying to build some trust
[00:22:29] with him so that he will listen to me.
[00:22:31] Right now, he's not really listening to me.
[00:22:33] He knows I don't have him with much experience,
[00:22:35] but I'm trying to build relationships so he can listen to me so we can actually do this
[00:22:38] and what I think is going to be a smarter way.
[00:22:40] Can you guys help me build this relationship by kicking ass for the next three projects
[00:22:45] that we've got?
[00:22:46] So I can build up some cloud and come back to him and get the tools or the people
[00:22:50] whatever it is that we need.
[00:22:52] Yeah, you always have this real finesse sort of way of saying stuff like you.
[00:22:59] It's what I guess you were saying and I think you were wrong actually.
[00:23:07] You were saying that standing up and doing the right thing is the same thing as avoiding conflict.
[00:23:21] No, I didn't mean it like that.
[00:23:23] I meant that they're not necessarily always opposite.
[00:23:26] They're not doing the right thing in avoiding conflict.
[00:23:29] There's just some issue wash you kind of room in the wiggle room,
[00:23:31] and when I say avoiding you should always be quote unquote avoiding conflict.
[00:23:35] I meant, of course, not always, but I meant more.
[00:23:38] Even if I'm going to confront someone or something about something that's wrong,
[00:23:42] I still should be, while I do that, I should be avoiding conflict.
[00:23:46] For sure, doing it in a finesse sort of way to actually just keep everything rolling
[00:23:50] forward, maybe just nudging in a different direction.
[00:23:53] But I actually know that I'm sort of reading this again.
[00:23:55] I understand what he's asking.
[00:23:57] It's like, is there a time where it's like,
[00:23:59] hey, there's gonna be conflict?
[00:24:00] Is there a time where it's worth the conflict?
[00:24:04] And where is that point?
[00:24:05] You know, at the point that I always give is,
[00:24:07] if you're telling me, hey, Jocco, go do the mission this way
[00:24:10] and I'm like, you know what, I'm not doing it.
[00:24:12] And you go, okay, find your fire.
[00:24:15] And now, do you put someone some yes man in my place
[00:24:18] and then that yes man gets everyone killed
[00:24:19] because it was a stupid plan.
[00:24:22] Did I really help?
[00:24:22] Or should I have said, hey, boss, I'm really gonna recommend
[00:24:25] we do it in a different way here, some different options.
[00:24:26] And then finally you say no, Jocco, you do it my way
[00:24:28] and guess what, even then I can go on mitigate and the field.
[00:24:31] Even then I can say, you know what?
[00:24:33] And the classic example that is in band brothers,
[00:24:37] when Dick Winners of awesome leader,
[00:24:41] they send a recon mission across the river,
[00:24:44] one night, someone dies, they come back,
[00:24:47] the war's over, it's all but over.
[00:24:49] And the next night they want to do another reconnaissance mission.
[00:24:51] And Dick Winners is like, sir, I'm not sure that's a great idea.
[00:24:54] He's like, do it.
[00:24:54] He goes, okay, Roger that.
[00:24:56] The guys go down, they drink a couple bottles of wine
[00:24:58] in the bottom of the, they don't do the mission.
[00:25:01] He mitigated the risk.
[00:25:02] If you would have stood up and, you know,
[00:25:04] that's a great example of where he avoided conflict.
[00:25:09] He stayed in the game.
[00:25:10] He wasn't, he said yes, yes sir, got it, we got it.
[00:25:13] And then he did disobeyed.
[00:25:15] Sure, he put his, he put his rank at risk
[00:25:17] and probably could have gotten in some trouble
[00:25:19] but he knew his the right thing to do.
[00:25:20] Yeah, that was like the best sort of way to do him.
[00:25:24] And again, you, you're always thinking of like the long game.
[00:25:31] versus the short game, you know, where it's like,
[00:25:33] and we can keep that perspective, these things become a little bit more clear,
[00:25:37] you know, they always do.
[00:25:39] Yes, sir.
[00:25:40] Next question, Jockel, I recently interviewed for a team,
[00:25:43] lead job, but wasn't selected because I don't have leadership experience.
[00:25:48] How can I lead what I'm not in charge?
[00:25:51] Well, you're in charge of something.
[00:25:52] You're certainly in charge of something.
[00:25:54] You're in charge of some piece of gear.
[00:25:56] You're in charge of some task.
[00:25:58] You're in charge of maybe a couple people here or there,
[00:26:00] but even if you're not, you're in charge of something.
[00:26:02] So whatever you're in charge of, take charge of it.
[00:26:05] Take charge of whatever your task is you take charge of it.
[00:26:08] You own it, you do it to perfection.
[00:26:10] Then once you've got that completely dialed,
[00:26:12] then you know what, you reach out and you see who else you can help.
[00:26:16] You help with other tasks.
[00:26:17] You look for work. If you look for work, you're going to find it.
[00:26:20] You're going to find it.
[00:26:22] You're going to find it.
[00:26:23] You're going to start taking things from other people.
[00:26:24] Now what you have to be careful of is that you don't step on toes, right?
[00:26:29] Because just about everyone, think about this.
[00:26:32] Just about everyone is offended by someone that wants to be in charge.
[00:26:35] Right.
[00:26:36] Hey, let me take charge of this here.
[00:26:38] Right.
[00:26:38] Is that right there makes people cringe?
[00:26:41] What to take lead on this?
[00:26:42] Let me just, you know what?
[00:26:43] Hey, listen up, guys.
[00:26:44] Right.
[00:26:45] If you're that guy, then everyone goes, hmm.
[00:26:47] Now there's a key point.
[00:26:48] This is beautiful.
[00:26:50] This is beautiful.
[00:26:51] So let's say we're in a cartoon.
[00:26:53] There's something going on.
[00:26:55] In a mid grade position.
[00:26:57] And I realize like, I want to be lead, right?
[00:27:01] Now if I just go in and go, hey, guys, let me run this next mission.
[00:27:04] People are like, do you know what are you talking about?
[00:27:05] You don't know anything.
[00:27:07] OK.
[00:27:08] And they're kind of dug in against me, by the way, at that point.
[00:27:11] If I give it a knife, I let things escalate a little bit.
[00:27:17] What I would usually do is I would let things escalate to a point to where when I took
[00:27:24] charge, people were waiting for it and they were happy that I took charge.
[00:27:29] Then even though I was, even though I was tasked in a manner, like if you're tasked
[00:27:31] in a commander, OK, so I got late and stone are working for me.
[00:27:34] I'm tasked in a commander, we're out on an operation.
[00:27:37] Something starts going wrong.
[00:27:38] Right.
[00:27:39] If I'm doing a building clearance with his platoon, something starts going wrong.
[00:27:43] I'd jump down there and say, all right, guys, push over that way, start clearing that hallway.
[00:27:46] How does Lay feel?
[00:27:47] Yeah, kind of.
[00:27:49] Yeah.
[00:27:50] Fees.
[00:27:51] He feels like I jumped down and micromanage his platoon and why are you doing this?
[00:27:55] Everything was going fine.
[00:27:56] So I don't want to do that.
[00:27:58] I want, first of all, I want him to work things out, of course.
[00:28:01] So let's say, same things happening.
[00:28:03] Things are going a little bit bad.
[00:28:05] There's starting to be a little bit of confusion.
[00:28:06] There's starting to be escalated voices. There's starting to people be, you know, hey, wait, wait,
[00:28:10] no, don't go there.
[00:28:11] You can hear it.
[00:28:12] It's really obvious when things are going wrong.
[00:28:14] I might let that escalate a little bit.
[00:28:16] Let it get to a point where the life knows, she doesn't have control this anymore.
[00:28:20] Now like I'm going to go, hey, everyone lock it up.
[00:28:23] You four hold on that hallway.
[00:28:24] You two start clearing that back room.
[00:28:26] Everyone else gets to the rooftop and all security.
[00:28:28] You know what everyone thinks?
[00:28:29] Including life?
[00:28:30] They go, thank God that just happened.
[00:28:31] Right.
[00:28:32] Now, and that can happen from anywhere in the chain of command.
[00:28:35] I'm happening, I happen to be given an example when I was the task commander, but I would
[00:28:38] do the same thing when I was an E5, which is, oh, things are going a little bit sideways.
[00:28:44] No one wants to hear the guy that as soon as they opportunity.
[00:28:47] As soon as there's any void of leadership, you're just jumping in there like, okay, guys,
[00:28:54] Captain America, to the rescue, right?
[00:28:56] You don't want to do that.
[00:28:58] You want to let that.
[00:28:59] I'll tell you what happens.
[00:29:00] If there's a little tiny void that you try and jump into, guess what you're going to do.
[00:29:03] You're going to bump into everyone else that's in that void.
[00:29:06] You have to meet an actual void of leadership.
[00:29:09] Once that actual void of leadership opens up, and it's big enough, you jump in there.
[00:29:15] Because you've detached, because you are detached, because you're watching it happen,
[00:29:19] you jump in there and you have so much confidence in what you're saying.
[00:29:22] You have so much understanding of the situation.
[00:29:24] You look like a genius and everyone's happy that you just did that.
[00:29:27] And by the way, as soon as that problem gets solved, you step back out, the leadership
[00:29:32] void is closed up by someone else and you're good to go.
[00:29:35] And next time, people will not be surprised at all when something goes wrong and you're
[00:29:40] stepping and you've solved the problem.
[00:29:42] So that's what you should do.
[00:29:43] You, yes, you want to be in charge, yes, you should look for work, but you can't step on
[00:29:47] toes.
[00:29:48] Don't jump in every time, you get like Captain America.
[00:29:51] I'm going to save the day.
[00:29:53] No, you're not.
[00:29:55] Let there be a real problem, assess it from the outside.
[00:29:59] And like I said, you got to be careful about being Captain America.
[00:30:03] You got to be careful about being on.
[00:30:04] I'm going to, I'm ready to stand up every moment.
[00:30:07] And that's a problem.
[00:30:08] You know, it's a problem when someone's goal is going to sound weird.
[00:30:14] When someone's goal is to be a leader, like my goal is to be a leader.
[00:30:19] Like if that's what they're thinking, that's going to offend people.
[00:30:24] It's going to offend people.
[00:30:25] Because, and I'll say why it offends people to rightfully so.
[00:30:28] You know why it offends people?
[00:30:29] Because what is it about?
[00:30:30] It's about me.
[00:30:32] I want to be a leader.
[00:30:33] I mean me want to lead.
[00:30:36] That's what it's about.
[00:30:37] And everyone recognize that.
[00:30:38] If what you really want to do is you want the team to win.
[00:30:42] And you realize that sometimes you're going to be in a supporting role and sometimes there
[00:30:45] might be in a situation where you need to lead almost hesitantly, you know what?
[00:30:51] Leadership needs to happen.
[00:30:52] I'll go make it happen because the team needs it to win.
[00:30:55] I'm here for the team.
[00:30:57] So don't be the person about yourself.
[00:30:59] We don't like that person.
[00:31:00] I don't even like that person.
[00:31:01] As much as I love people that want to step up and lead, I don't want that person.
[00:31:05] That's like looking for themselves.
[00:31:09] Sometimes you've got to be following.
[00:31:10] I want someone that's like, hey, oh cool.
[00:31:12] I got your back.
[00:31:13] Don't worry about.
[00:31:14] I'm over here.
[00:31:15] I'm over here part of the train.
[00:31:16] I'm over here clearing rooms.
[00:31:17] Oh wait a second, there's a leadership void.
[00:31:19] And now there's an actual problem going on.
[00:31:20] Oh, and then that person suddenly steps up and solves the problem.
[00:31:22] Then goes right back down to their level.
[00:31:24] Awesome.
[00:31:25] That's the person you want.
[00:31:26] That's person you want to be.
[00:31:27] Yeah, you know how like now they're here.
[00:31:30] A lot nowadays where they're add value.
[00:31:32] You just want to add value.
[00:31:33] So what's the sense you're what you're doing?
[00:31:35] Even now that leads to situation.
[00:31:37] It's like boom, I'm going to add value.
[00:31:38] So one, okay, if you're going to start with my own role.
[00:31:40] You know, that's where I'm going to add the most value in my own role.
[00:31:43] But if there's little voids in whatever capacity that needs some value added, I'm going
[00:31:50] to add that value.
[00:31:51] But you can't just be piling on the value where it's not needed.
[00:31:54] No, don't don't put additional value into non-value needing areas exactly.
[00:31:59] That's problematic too much value.
[00:32:01] It's true.
[00:32:02] All right, next question.
[00:32:03] Hi, Jocco.
[00:32:05] When you're trying to take ownership of a mistake made by a fellow team member, what
[00:32:08] do you do if the team leader asks for a step by step step by step breakdown of events?
[00:32:14] I've said it was arm mistake and not to end not made excuses.
[00:32:19] But a step by step breakdown would expose the fact that he alone was responsible for
[00:32:24] that error.
[00:32:25] Interesting.
[00:32:26] Do you think that's interesting?
[00:32:28] It is, wait, so he's saying, okay, it's arm mistake.
[00:32:32] I don't want to individualize this guy or make him stand out of whatever.
[00:32:38] It's arm mistake and we're going to fix it kind of thing.
[00:32:40] And he's like, no, I want the step by step.
[00:32:41] The step step step step step is going to reveal the so-lo.
[00:32:45] Actually, bills fall.
[00:32:47] And now what I tried so hard to take ownership.
[00:32:52] Here's the fault.
[00:32:55] It was actually build that was all jacked up.
[00:32:59] It's actually not my fault.
[00:33:00] It's the truth, right?
[00:33:01] You get that, right?
[00:33:02] Yeah, because check it out.
[00:33:05] Who's responsible?
[00:33:07] When you're taking ownership of something, when you're taking extreme ownership of something,
[00:33:11] whose fault is it?
[00:33:12] Your mind?
[00:33:13] Yeah, sure.
[00:33:14] Was that include when someone else on your team makes a mistake?
[00:33:17] Yes.
[00:33:18] But how can that be?
[00:33:19] Good, it's here.
[00:33:21] So let me ask you these questions.
[00:33:23] Here's what I'd be thinking.
[00:33:26] The teammate was in error.
[00:33:30] Why?
[00:33:31] Why did the teammate make a mistake?
[00:33:33] Why didn't the teammate have backup?
[00:33:35] Why didn't the rest of the members of the team?
[00:33:37] Why didn't I actually go through with him and make sure that he knew how to do that procedure
[00:33:42] properly?
[00:33:43] He's part of my team.
[00:33:45] We're responsible for this taking place.
[00:33:46] I knew he was a little bit shaky and I didn't do anything to fix it.
[00:33:50] That's why it's our fault.
[00:33:52] It's not our fault because we say, oh, it's our fault, but it's really bill.
[00:33:56] That's not what we're talking about.
[00:33:58] The point is, the point is to actually own it.
[00:34:01] So with my coworker fails, I'm literally saying to myself, what mistake did I make that
[00:34:07] my coworker drop the ball?
[00:34:11] What mistake did I make?
[00:34:12] My coworker dropped the ball.
[00:34:15] What mistake did I make?
[00:34:17] Did I not show it to him?
[00:34:18] Did I not ask him if you knew how to do it?
[00:34:20] Did I not ask him if he needed some help?
[00:34:22] Did I not confirm that he knew the procedures correctly?
[00:34:24] All those things are my fault.
[00:34:27] Did I not do a good job of identifying that bill as a little bit slow on the uptake?
[00:34:32] And therefore he needed a little extra preparation for this.
[00:34:36] And now think about this.
[00:34:38] What can I do?
[00:34:39] Once I make this mistake, we're going to do the fix.
[00:34:40] I'm going to think about this from a leadership perspective.
[00:34:43] You go down and you say, hey, you guys messed up this thing.
[00:34:47] Why did it happen?
[00:34:49] Now think about the team wherever it goes.
[00:34:50] Well, it's our fault.
[00:34:53] Mostly bill.
[00:34:55] Right?
[00:34:56] Sure.
[00:34:57] And I'll tell you, when I look at a pollotoon and bill made a mistake, I don't look at bill.
[00:35:06] A good leader doesn't just look at bill.
[00:35:08] A good leadership looks at everyone on the team, especially certainly the leadership.
[00:35:11] But I think this guy's talking about from a peer, but it doesn't matter.
[00:35:14] From a peer perspective, if there's a mistake that happens, we are truly response
[00:35:19] possible.
[00:35:21] And then from a leadership perspective, when I go down to the team and I say, hey, guys,
[00:35:25] what happened?
[00:35:26] And they say, well, it was our fault.
[00:35:28] But this is what bill did.
[00:35:29] I go, okay, so you just drop in nine months bill.
[00:35:31] I'm not going to say that.
[00:35:32] But I'm like, I think it's not okay.
[00:35:33] So it's all bill's fault.
[00:35:34] Cool.
[00:35:35] I'll tell you what.
[00:35:36] Whereas if you say, hey, listen, bosses is what happened.
[00:35:39] Here's the procedures we went.
[00:35:40] I don't think we did a good job of briefing bill because here's what bill did.
[00:35:44] He did step three instead of step four.
[00:35:47] I fault we went through twice, but why should have gone through it a couple more times
[00:35:50] and confirmed he knew it was going on?
[00:35:51] It's not going to happen again.
[00:35:52] We got this.
[00:35:54] Which guy you want to work for?
[00:35:55] Which guy do you want?
[00:35:56] Which team do you want?
[00:35:58] You want the team where people are taking ownership of the problem, not blaming Bill.
[00:36:05] Ownership is not just saying we own it.
[00:36:09] Ownership is actually owning it.
[00:36:12] And that's what makes it so powerful.
[00:36:14] If you actually own it, then you actually look at Bill beforehand and you go look in our
[00:36:19] team.
[00:36:20] Do we have any weaknesses?
[00:36:21] Yeah, we do.
[00:36:22] Bill doesn't bill can't get this part of the procedure done right.
[00:36:25] Here's what we're going to do.
[00:36:26] We're going to put Bill into this other position.
[00:36:28] That's an easier part of the procedure.
[00:36:29] We're going to make sure he knows how to do that.
[00:36:30] Meanwhile, we're taking Mike and Mike is going to go down here and he nails this procedure
[00:36:35] and he's going to spend, by the way, in extra 15 minutes a day during lunch, he's going
[00:36:38] to get Bill's trained up so Bill can eventually think.
[00:36:40] That's the kind of thing you do on a team.
[00:36:42] Yeah.
[00:36:43] You made it pretty clear with just, which is kind of, because it's not that easy to understand
[00:36:51] or it wasn't for me anyway.
[00:36:52] I mean, it was put it this way.
[00:36:54] It was very valuable when I didn't understand this about extreme ownership.
[00:36:58] I said this before too, by the way.
[00:37:00] So there's essentially two parts of it that make it extreme ownership.
[00:37:04] Actually, there's three because there's the dichotomy, but aside from the dichotomy, this
[00:37:08] is what it is.
[00:37:09] You take responsibility and then you say what you're going to do to fix the problem.
[00:37:14] And then actually there's a third part, which is you implement the solution.
[00:37:17] Yes, yes, yes.
[00:37:18] You identify it.
[00:37:19] You own the problem.
[00:37:20] You identify a solution for the problem and then you implement the solution.
[00:37:23] Yes.
[00:37:24] That's what you do.
[00:37:25] Yeah.
[00:37:26] So a lot of times, especially in the beginning, like I would just as far as me just kind
[00:37:29] of casually trying to understand it, I would focus so much on taking responsibility.
[00:37:33] You know, it was my fault.
[00:37:34] You know, kind of thing.
[00:37:36] It's like, well, the taking responsibility is arguably more important than saying that
[00:37:44] it's your fault kind of thing.
[00:37:45] It's essentially your taking responsibility of the solution as well.
[00:37:49] If not, in a way, in a lot of practical cases, you don't even have to identify who's
[00:37:55] fault it is if you take responsibility of the solution.
[00:37:59] If I'm okay here.
[00:38:01] So if there's a full-ball team, just like the epitome of team, not the epitome, but
[00:38:06] want a good example of teamwork.
[00:38:07] Never mind the sales teams or whatever, but we're going to go with it.
[00:38:09] Well, football is pretty, it'll be more simple because it's so let's say, okay, we've
[00:38:13] got to pass or whatever and boom, the place, the place starts and a guy gets through the
[00:38:18] front line.
[00:38:19] Let's say the guard missed a block.
[00:38:23] Obviously, right?
[00:38:25] He missed it.
[00:38:26] Maybe he looked one way and he was supposed to look this way.
[00:38:28] He was supposed to not pull and he tried to pull or something.
[00:38:31] Maybe he just made a mistake.
[00:38:32] He just made a mistake.
[00:38:33] He's not incompetent.
[00:38:34] He just made a mistake.
[00:38:35] Who's fault is it?
[00:38:36] Okay.
[00:38:37] But if the quarterback's going to take extreme ownership, he's going to be like, hey,
[00:38:40] no part of the, hey, this happened.
[00:38:42] You know, next time we were, I'm going to remind him of him.
[00:38:44] This play that play, you know, this red 46, don't curve twist whatever.
[00:38:50] Like you don't pull and he probably probably be like, I'm not, I know.
[00:38:53] I know, don't go to school them.
[00:38:55] Just feel like he, you don't go, hey, no problem.
[00:38:57] But we're just not going to do that anymore.
[00:38:59] And then next time I call that play, I'm be like, you're good, right?
[00:39:02] I'm going to check with him.
[00:39:03] I didn't check with him.
[00:39:04] He won't make them a mistake.
[00:39:05] I'm going to check with him.
[00:39:06] He won't make them a mistake.
[00:39:07] And kind of like you, when we were now, we're driving, that he didn't mean, you know?
[00:39:10] It's kind of one of those things.
[00:39:11] The quarterback took responsibility for solving the problem.
[00:39:15] More so than he was like, okay, looks, that was my fault.
[00:39:18] They're making a big deal out of it being his fault.
[00:39:20] Yeah.
[00:39:21] You know, in his head, it is, you know, it's like, okay, this is my fault.
[00:39:23] I should, you know, I should make sure things are clear kind of thing.
[00:39:26] Like the weather, too.
[00:39:28] You know, your weather is bad.
[00:39:29] Yeah.
[00:39:30] Well, what bothers me the most about this question is, I feel like I feel like I feel
[00:39:34] like I don't do a good job of explaining this.
[00:39:38] Because what bothers me out is someone who ever wrote this question.
[00:39:41] And it's a good question.
[00:39:42] I get the question.
[00:39:43] I get scared that the person that's listening to the question goes, no, John, what
[00:39:47] doesn't quite get it.
[00:39:48] He doesn't quite get the fact that there was this one guy who was part of the team, who
[00:39:54] made this mistake.
[00:39:56] And no one, you know, we just, we can't hold his hand every time.
[00:40:00] Like, that's, it's not my fault.
[00:40:02] Not our teams fault when Bill drop completely drops the ball.
[00:40:07] That's not my fault.
[00:40:08] It's not anyone on the team's fault.
[00:40:10] And my point is, is exactly what you are saying, Echo.
[00:40:15] Yes, it is.
[00:40:17] And if you look at it when Bill makes the mistake himself, he's alone in a room.
[00:40:23] And he's supposed to, you know, he's supposed to put part A on top of part B and bolt them
[00:40:31] together.
[00:40:32] His part of the job.
[00:40:33] He's alone in a room doing that.
[00:40:35] And he doesn't do it.
[00:40:36] Right?
[00:40:37] That's 100% his fault.
[00:40:38] The answer is no, actually, who's in charge of training him?
[00:40:44] Who's in charge of checking who, who, not even in charge of who's responsible.
[00:40:48] We are a team.
[00:40:50] That means we work together.
[00:40:51] That means we confirm that we know how to do our individual parts of the job.
[00:40:56] That means we check and say, hey, Bill, are you good?
[00:40:58] Hey, Bill, let me check your first three that you do to make sure you understand what's
[00:41:01] happening.
[00:41:02] We do this together as a team.
[00:41:04] And it makes me feel like a failure that people have a hard time understanding this.
[00:41:11] And I know it can be a stretch.
[00:41:13] It can be a stretch.
[00:41:14] And, you know, I give all those examples.
[00:41:16] Hey, the machine gun or shoots in the wrong direction.
[00:41:18] Who's fault is that?
[00:41:19] It's not the machine.
[00:41:20] The machine gun or literally pointed the machine gun in the wrong direction, pulled
[00:41:23] the trigger and shot in the wrong direction.
[00:41:24] Who's fault is it?
[00:41:26] It's the squad leaders.
[00:41:27] It's the fire team leaders.
[00:41:28] It's the platoon leaders.
[00:41:30] Because they didn't make sure that he understood his field of fire.
[00:41:32] Make sure he understood how to operate his weapon.
[00:41:34] And by the way, there's a chance that the reason that Bill screwed this up and Bill is
[00:41:38] incapable of putting these parts together correctly.
[00:41:42] And if that is the situation, guess what?
[00:41:44] It is a responsibility of the team to either get him trained up to where he can do it or
[00:41:48] to tell the leadership that this guy cannot be incapable of doing the job.
[00:41:53] And therefore, he needs to not be here.
[00:41:56] That's what ownership is.
[00:41:58] That's what extreme ownership is.
[00:42:00] I think I know what it is.
[00:42:02] What makes it confusing or sometimes kind of slippery to grasp.
[00:42:08] Because it depends on who you ask.
[00:42:11] So a lot of times, the thing is when it's the machine gun is fault, the thing is if I'm
[00:42:15] not even a human being, I'm just a disembodied brain.
[00:42:20] Okay, it's the machine gun is fault and the leader is fault and it's everyone's fault.
[00:42:25] If I'm dead, but if you ask the individual person, because you ask a machine gun,
[00:42:29] hey, okay, jockey, you're the machine gun, you shot in the wrong direction and I ask you
[00:42:32] who's fault is that?
[00:42:33] What are you going to say?
[00:42:34] My leader's fault?
[00:42:35] Well, it's your fault.
[00:42:36] Well, let me tell you right now, there are plenty of people and definitely plenty of
[00:42:42] machine gunners that when they shoot that weapon in the wrong direction, no, what they
[00:42:45] say, I didn't get a clear brief on what the field of firework.
[00:42:48] No one, I didn't see the markers for what the range limits were.
[00:42:52] I didn't know where the other blue forces were.
[00:42:54] No one told me.
[00:42:55] So they're looking at it like it actually isn't their fault.
[00:42:58] Now you get some good machine and actually guess what?
[00:43:01] When you have a guy, that's a machine gunner that says, well, what was my fault?
[00:43:05] It was my leader's fault.
[00:43:06] You know what the leader says?
[00:43:07] You know what the leader says?
[00:43:08] What?
[00:43:09] The leader's bad leader.
[00:43:10] The leader in this team.
[00:43:12] The leader in this team, you know what he says?
[00:43:13] No, it was the machine gunner's fault.
[00:43:15] That's right.
[00:43:16] And now, guess who's fault it was?
[00:43:17] It was no one's fault.
[00:43:18] The machine gunner think is the boss's fault.
[00:43:19] The boss thinks it was the machine gunner's fault.
[00:43:21] Now who's going to fix the problem?
[00:43:22] The answer is no one.
[00:43:23] When you get a good team, the machine gunner goes to my fault.
[00:43:27] I should have paid their attention.
[00:43:28] The leader says my fault.
[00:43:29] And now you have everyone taking ownership of the problems.
[00:43:33] Yes.
[00:43:34] That's the way it's supposed to be.
[00:43:35] But that's my point.
[00:43:36] And that's why it makes it so hard.
[00:43:37] Never mind your disembodied brain.
[00:43:39] That's making decisions over here.
[00:43:41] I'm trying to make a point though.
[00:43:43] I'm saying this is what it's hard for people to understand.
[00:43:45] That's why sometimes.
[00:43:46] I'm with them.
[00:43:47] I'm like, there it's kind of like, it's kind of like, sure.
[00:43:50] I'm tricking to shoot ownership, you know, the typical.
[00:43:52] I'm taking ownership.
[00:43:53] But yeah, I don't have to end the day or we all know it's built for.
[00:43:56] But the reason that it is so hard because if I ask, okay, we have three guys.
[00:44:01] One of those guys is the machine gunner.
[00:44:02] The other guys are leading the other guys just another team member.
[00:44:05] He's, you know, he's the sniper or something.
[00:44:09] If I say, hey, this machine gunner shot in the wrong direction.
[00:44:11] Individual meetings, they all take extreme ownership, all of them are down.
[00:44:15] They're in the game.
[00:44:16] The all of them.
[00:44:17] I ask you machine gunner.
[00:44:19] Who's fault is that?
[00:44:20] What's he going to say?
[00:44:21] Well, okay, next guy who's faulted.
[00:44:24] Fire's you leader.
[00:44:25] My fault.
[00:44:26] I shouldn't.
[00:44:27] And the, yeah.
[00:44:28] Squad leader, my fault.
[00:44:29] I should have told them.
[00:44:30] Right.
[00:44:31] Yeah.
[00:44:32] So the read now go back to the disembodied brain.
[00:44:33] It's kind of like, way, way, way.
[00:44:34] So it's like, he did it.
[00:44:36] It's hard to grasp like that.
[00:44:40] One guy, it is his fault.
[00:44:42] The thing is not just his fault.
[00:44:44] Apparently, because everyone said it's their fault.
[00:44:47] So he was obviously his fault.
[00:44:48] But wait, it's everyone's fault kind of thing.
[00:44:50] So when you're the guy and you're saying, okay, his fault, it that little thing creeps
[00:44:54] in your brain.
[00:44:55] That's like, yeah, wait, it is his fault.
[00:44:56] Yeah.
[00:44:57] You know, and you're wrong.
[00:44:58] Yeah.
[00:44:59] And you're wrong.
[00:45:00] And I need to do a better job of explaining to people because I see questions
[00:45:05] like this on a fairly regular basis, which is, but hey, really.
[00:45:10] You know, there's a guy, I get ownership, but really.
[00:45:13] Yeah.
[00:45:14] That's what I mean.
[00:45:15] It's the butt, really, that you need to check yourself on.
[00:45:17] Yeah.
[00:45:18] Because the reality is you're responsible.
[00:45:21] Yeah.
[00:45:21] You.
[00:45:22] Wait, but if I'm responsible, what about the machine?
[00:45:25] He just said he's responsible for the machine gunner.
[00:45:27] You're responsible.
[00:45:28] I know, but the machine gunner said he's responsible.
[00:45:31] Let's see what I'm saying now.
[00:45:32] I think that's the feeling that that you let that creep in.
[00:45:35] Yeah.
[00:45:35] And that's going to be a problem.
[00:45:36] Yeah.
[00:45:37] You've seen office space.
[00:45:39] Yeah.
[00:45:40] Yeah.
[00:45:41] So really, when you think about, okay, what's the big thing?
[00:45:43] I don't think he has the movie remembers.
[00:45:45] Yeah, you do.
[00:45:46] Okay, let me remind you, okay.
[00:45:48] So in the beginning, they were like, hey, Peter, we're putting cover sheets on the TPS reports
[00:45:54] from now on.
[00:45:55] We've been doing that.
[00:45:56] You forgot to do that.
[00:45:57] Right?
[00:45:58] So first lumber comes his boss.
[00:46:00] First lumber comes his like, yeah, you know, saying, hey, let me read.
[00:46:03] He didn't do it in a thick way.
[00:46:04] I know I ain't for sure, but he said, hey, this is basically a reminder.
[00:46:08] Did you get that memo?
[00:46:09] We're putting cover sheets on the TPS reports.
[00:46:10] He said, yeah, I just forgot.
[00:46:12] It was one time thing, no problem.
[00:46:13] He's like cool, all that, you know, so if you just do that, do that, that'd be cool.
[00:46:19] And he's like, cool, no problem.
[00:46:20] He's all, I'll even give you another copy of that memo.
[00:46:22] He almost like over did it.
[00:46:24] Not almost he did over do it.
[00:46:25] So he left.
[00:46:26] And then the other boss boom, who was like one level down, he came, same deal.
[00:46:30] Hey, we're putting, did you get that memo?
[00:46:32] TPS reports, cover sheets now, probably.
[00:46:34] He's like, I got the memo.
[00:46:36] I forgot one time thing.
[00:46:37] He's like, yeah, I'm just all those bosses were doing, making sure the problem got solved.
[00:46:43] Right, doing everything in their power.
[00:46:45] Even his other, his friends were like, hey, what's up?
[00:46:47] I heard you guys, you're having problems with your TPS.
[00:46:50] So they were just taking extreme ownership, taking ownership of the problem, trying to solve
[00:46:53] it.
[00:46:54] But we give them crap about it.
[00:46:56] Who do we give a movie?
[00:46:58] You know, movie somewhere?
[00:46:59] Yeah, yeah, because they're trying to make it funny, dude.
[00:47:01] Yeah, I know.
[00:47:02] But that's kind of ironic.
[00:47:03] It's ironic.
[00:47:04] But yeah, I know, but it's ironic, right?
[00:47:05] It is.
[00:47:06] You know.
[00:47:07] So I'm not even mad at Lumberg for that.
[00:47:09] Let's say in the next question.
[00:47:10] Hi, Jockel.
[00:47:11] Question for you. I know you're very busy guy.
[00:47:14] How do you find time to read so many books?
[00:47:18] I have many that I want to read, but I've trouble having enough time.
[00:47:23] Any advice on how to set aside time to do so?
[00:47:26] Yeah, sure.
[00:47:28] All right, land on me.
[00:47:30] Make time.
[00:47:31] What are you doing all day?
[00:47:35] What are you doing all day?
[00:47:38] The clock's sick.
[00:47:39] What are you doing all day?
[00:47:40] Are you watching TV?
[00:47:41] Are you surfing the internet?
[00:47:44] Are you watching YouTube videos?
[00:47:46] That's my question.
[00:47:48] What are you doing before you go to sleep at night?
[00:47:51] Are you looking at Twitter?
[00:47:53] Are you looking at Instagram posts, Instagram videos?
[00:48:02] Tell me they're not like an addiction.
[00:48:05] You get the Instagram video.
[00:48:08] One of them is funny, they're 38 seconds long.
[00:48:11] They're one minute long.
[00:48:12] Get to see people hurt themselves, get to see people do dumb things.
[00:48:16] Make you feel good about yourself.
[00:48:18] I didn't do that dumb thing.
[00:48:20] Someone else did.
[00:48:21] I can laugh at them.
[00:48:22] How long you're going to look at those videos for when you could be reading.
[00:48:27] So there you go.
[00:48:29] Stop wasting a bunch of time.
[00:48:31] And then what about audio books?
[00:48:33] What are you doing when you're mowing the lawn?
[00:48:36] What are you doing when you're trimming the hedges?
[00:48:38] What are you doing when you're pulling weeds?
[00:48:40] What are you doing when you're cleaning the dishes?
[00:48:42] Get some audio books.
[00:48:44] Get some audio books.
[00:48:46] What are you doing first thing in the morning?
[00:48:48] What are you doing?
[00:48:50] Are you waking up, checking your email, sitting around, waiting, wasting a bunch of time?
[00:49:00] Are you getting up early enough that you could just get up and get out of bed?
[00:49:04] Go and read for 30 minutes.
[00:49:08] That's what you have to do.
[00:49:09] You have to make time.
[00:49:10] There's plenty of time to read.
[00:49:12] There's plenty of time to read.
[00:49:15] You probably don't want to read as badly as you think.
[00:49:23] If you wanted to read that bad, you'd make time.
[00:49:26] You make time to breathe somehow.
[00:49:28] If you can make time to breathe, you can make time to read.
[00:49:32] Let's say it's the best.
[00:49:34] Yeah, it would be a better one.
[00:49:36] Because yeah, eat, I think.
[00:49:38] Because read, you can read while you're doing other things sometimes.
[00:49:41] Especially with the others.
[00:49:42] Just kind of as a, so I'm reading, I'm always have to be reading a book to read a book
[00:49:48] for the podcast, right?
[00:49:49] I had only read the first maybe 10 books that we read that we did in the podcast.
[00:49:54] We've done a hundred or something now.
[00:49:56] Probably more than that.
[00:49:57] I don't read like 10 of them.
[00:49:59] Maybe it may be a few more.
[00:50:00] But I'd read them so long ago.
[00:50:02] Maybe I'd read 30.
[00:50:03] But I'd read some of them so long ago that just,
[00:50:05] I had to reread them.
[00:50:07] And so then you said to yourself, okay.
[00:50:10] So when, when you don't when I read all the time,
[00:50:12] I read going about reading, wake up, reading.
[00:50:15] Going in an airplane.
[00:50:18] People, what do people do in an airplane?
[00:50:21] See, watch a movie, I know you sleep.
[00:50:23] They do all this stuff.
[00:50:24] I sleep sometimes in an airplane.
[00:50:25] But if you're not sleeping, you get us a guess on what I'm doing.
[00:50:27] Reading, forever, forever, forever.
[00:50:28] I can't test it out.
[00:50:29] Yeah.
[00:50:30] What do you think is the, like, the biggest ones that people are,
[00:50:34] you know, that you know, the biggest activities that they could,
[00:50:39] yeah, they could just stop.
[00:50:42] And for me, I think the biggest time sucks are YouTube.
[00:50:47] I think Instagram.
[00:50:50] Yeah.
[00:50:51] I think those two are really,
[00:50:53] what's the word stimulating to the brain?
[00:50:56] Yeah.
[00:50:57] And you actually get this weird, like, well, I actually,
[00:50:59] like, I'm going to learn a little something from this right here.
[00:51:01] I'm going to take something away from this.
[00:51:03] I'm going to veg out.
[00:51:04] I'm going to escape from my world right now.
[00:51:09] It's like a scapeysm, right?
[00:51:11] Yeah.
[00:51:12] And they, they actually have algorithms that are,
[00:51:18] that know what you will click on.
[00:51:22] They actually know that about you.
[00:51:24] They mapped your little brain.
[00:51:27] And know that if they put up a video that has,
[00:51:31] if they put up a thumbnail of a video,
[00:51:34] and it's got a heavy machine gun in it,
[00:51:38] they know they got a good chance I'm going to click on it.
[00:51:41] Right?
[00:51:42] And then they give it a catch phrase title, right?
[00:51:45] No.
[00:51:46] They give it a catch phrase title.
[00:51:47] I just get's massacre.
[00:51:49] I got to watch that.
[00:51:51] Got to do it.
[00:51:52] Yeah.
[00:51:52] Oh, click.
[00:51:53] Oh.
[00:51:54] 50 cow versus Taliban.
[00:51:57] Oh, cool.
[00:51:58] Black.
[00:51:59] Yeah.
[00:52:01] Yeah.
[00:52:02] And actually, no words you're going to click on.
[00:52:04] And that's, that's, so, and what do you get out of it?
[00:52:07] You watch it for 20 minutes.
[00:52:10] Or game.
[00:52:11] Yeah.
[00:52:12] You get nothing out of it.
[00:52:13] You get a book.
[00:52:14] You read.
[00:52:15] You learn.
[00:52:16] You write something.
[00:52:17] That's what you do.
[00:52:18] Yeah.
[00:52:19] And actually, the YouTube thing is,
[00:52:20] it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's not just YouTube,
[00:52:25] but who's trying to get you to watch the video.
[00:52:27] It's the video makers themselves.
[00:52:28] So YouTube has the algorithm.
[00:52:29] Oh, they got it all kind of sorted out there.
[00:52:31] And now the video makers, they make titles like 50 cow versus XYZ and awful bunch of things too.
[00:52:37] And guess what?
[00:52:38] 50 cow versus you can fill in the blank.
[00:52:40] You're probably going to watch that video.
[00:52:42] Doesn't matter.
[00:52:43] Don't matter.
[00:52:44] Motivation speech ever.
[00:52:45] Yes.
[00:52:46] They get with the sentence.
[00:52:47] Oh, yeah.
[00:52:48] So, and so destroys whatever destroys reporter in interview.
[00:52:53] Yeah.
[00:52:54] Exactly.
[00:52:55] Right.
[00:52:56] So once you really owned.
[00:52:57] Yeah.
[00:52:58] So basically, right when you log onto YouTube, once YouTube pops up on your screen, bro, everyone on that screen is all sucking your attention.
[00:53:11] Literally, that's their job sucking your attention.
[00:53:13] So, yeah, man, that's a big one.
[00:53:15] Right, Instagram.
[00:53:16] So here's the, here's one that really hit me really hard.
[00:53:18] The Graham.
[00:53:19] The Graham.
[00:53:20] And I like Instagram.
[00:53:21] It's like, good.
[00:53:22] But if you're like trying to read, you know, if you want to read more, whatever,
[00:53:26] consider like, even like, let's say we start recording this for a second, we're going to look at the boss of our phones.
[00:53:31] We're going to maybe check in email, maybe we got to text or whatever.
[00:53:34] And the probability of Instagram coming up on there.
[00:53:37] We're going to, you know, open it, but the probability of us opening Instagram is pretty significant.
[00:53:44] It's pretty high.
[00:53:45] And you know, scroll through there, whatever.
[00:53:47] Even if you scroll for two, three minutes, right?
[00:53:49] You scroll through there.
[00:53:50] Maybe what you looked at, I don't know, 15, 20 people's posts.
[00:53:54] Read what they had to say.
[00:53:56] But if you have a, what do you, what do you, what do you call like, kindle or something?
[00:54:01] But you do that same thing.
[00:54:02] It's like kind of, like, if you're saying you could read.
[00:54:05] Yeah, read instead.
[00:54:06] So if you had a camera like once you said like, imagine your video, video tape, like, what if you were being video tape all day?
[00:54:12] And all it was calculate every time you opened up Instagram or Facebook or Twitter and or YouTube all those particular.
[00:54:18] Every time you open up, but instead, you had that scenario in one average day.
[00:54:22] Then you take all that time and replace it with you opened your Kindle to read or boss out of book.
[00:54:27] You know, you're bringing books or whatever with you.
[00:54:29] And that's how to, instead of doing that, you did the book.
[00:54:32] Right, and how much reading you do, right, you'd read so much.
[00:54:34] A lot of reading.
[00:54:35] Yeah.
[00:54:36] So it's like, yeah, those are the time sucks, man.
[00:54:38] You're phone.
[00:54:39] It's so available, you know, but right, you can read on your phone too.
[00:54:42] That's a big one.
[00:54:43] TV2.
[00:54:44] You watched TV?
[00:54:46] Not really.
[00:54:47] But I watched one show now. And actually two, Hawaii 5.0 and that's it.
[00:54:52] Sometimes Shark Tank.
[00:54:53] That's it, man.
[00:54:54] 100% swear.
[00:54:55] What is it?
[00:54:56] How often is a Hawaii 5.0 on?
[00:54:58] One to week.
[00:54:59] And it goes in season.
[00:55:00] So you got it.
[00:55:01] How long is this season?
[00:55:02] I don't know.
[00:55:03] 13 episodes, I guess.
[00:55:04] I don't know.
[00:55:05] I don't know.
[00:55:06] But nonetheless.
[00:55:07] I have watched one TV show recently.
[00:55:10] What?
[00:55:11] It's called billions.
[00:55:12] No, well.
[00:55:13] You know.
[00:55:14] There's a little scenario unfolding on billions.
[00:55:18] So.
[00:55:19] All right.
[00:55:20] Well, you know, actually, yeah, actually, yeah.
[00:55:24] And keep in mind, it's not like I've never seen any other show ever.
[00:55:28] And never will.
[00:55:29] It's not that.
[00:55:30] Yeah.
[00:55:30] I'm just saying, you know how people they like take a watch.
[00:55:31] I know.
[00:55:32] And actually, I will separate the fact that nowadays, you can watch TV in a different way.
[00:55:38] Right.
[00:55:39] It's not like at eight o'clock on a Thursday night.
[00:55:41] You got to sit there and watch.
[00:55:42] It's not like a 30 minute show with the 30 minutes worth of commercials in it.
[00:55:45] Yeah.
[00:55:46] Right.
[00:55:46] No, you can, you're, you're on a flight somewhere.
[00:55:51] You've read, you've got to take it easy on your eyes a little bit.
[00:55:53] If you start reading too much, you've read for a long time.
[00:55:55] Okay, you're going to stare out the window for a little while.
[00:55:57] Listen to this part of a podcast or something.
[00:55:59] Then you're like, okay, my brain is like barely functioning.
[00:56:02] Yeah.
[00:56:03] Okay.
[00:56:04] I'm going to watch an episode of billions.
[00:56:05] Yeah.
[00:56:06] Well, the ballers.
[00:56:07] Everything ballers.
[00:56:08] I don't know the different, well, I do know the different.
[00:56:11] Yeah.
[00:56:12] I just don't know the different.
[00:56:13] It's like, you know, like, you know, like, people have a routine, like,
[00:56:16] tenet, you know, every night for 30 minutes, they watch TV with their kids or whatever.
[00:56:21] It's like that doesn't really happen anymore.
[00:56:24] Yeah.
[00:56:25] Next question.
[00:56:27] You really.
[00:56:28] Sad how much time you can waste these days with the distractions and the people trying to get that time from you.
[00:56:37] Yeah.
[00:56:38] You're, discipline like when you, when you first start saying discipline.
[00:56:40] Oh, when I first started hearing it from you, that was like one of the things that popped into my head, like, as being really obvious.
[00:56:46] Like if you are discipline with your time, you will have a lot of free time, like a lot, a lot of free time.
[00:56:53] Way more than you would think anyway, because, you know, even when I'm like real busy, you know,
[00:56:58] if I can accurately remember my day, I can remember like just like five minutes here,
[00:57:02] 15 minutes there, like that I did something that was a waste of time.
[00:57:06] And if you add up all those little minutes, you have probably hours.
[00:57:09] Probably hours for to do whatever.
[00:57:12] Yeah.
[00:57:13] Do something progressive, you know, progressive, progressive, progressive life.
[00:57:20] Value valuable, all those things.
[00:57:23] Check.
[00:57:24] Next question.
[00:57:25] Would your extreme ownership philosophy have changed or lost confidence if you had been relieved of command when taking ownership of friendly fire incident?
[00:57:34] You described being your first book.
[00:57:36] The book, extreme ownership, by the way.
[00:57:39] Yes.
[00:57:40] Just to be perfectly clear about this, I wasn't taking ownership of the situation,
[00:57:47] so that I could keep my job.
[00:57:49] It wasn't a political maneuver to set myself up to look good.
[00:57:54] I was taking ownership of the situation because I was the leader of the situation that took place.
[00:58:03] I was the guy responsible for what was happening.
[00:58:06] I was taking ownership because that was the correct thing.
[00:58:10] The correct thing is something bad and happened and I was in charge of it.
[00:58:15] And yes, I could have been fired.
[00:58:20] And if I would have been fired, I would have accepted it and I wouldn't have done anything different.
[00:58:27] So again, this is sort of similar to a couple of questions ago.
[00:58:32] That extreme ownership is not about avoiding trouble.
[00:58:37] It's not about avoiding trouble.
[00:58:38] You don't say, well, I own it and then you don't get trouble.
[00:58:41] You actually could get fired.
[00:58:44] You actually could get fired.
[00:58:46] And that's why that idea of preemptive ownership.
[00:58:52] I talked about that at one of the monsters.
[00:58:55] If in the back of your mind, if in the back of my mind, I think, you know what?
[00:58:58] If the普通 makes a mistake, I can just blame it on them.
[00:59:01] I'll be good.
[00:59:02] Well, now I'm not really that worried about their plan because I got that little out if I need it.
[00:59:05] I'm not worried about if the guys understand the rules would engage.
[00:59:07] Because I got that a little out if I need it.
[00:59:09] I'm not that worried about deconstruction because I got that little out if they screwed up.
[00:59:12] So I haven't out for myself.
[00:59:14] And so I don't really put 100% effort into the planning and of what we're doing.
[00:59:23] If I have preemptive ownership, where is this?
[00:59:25] Hey, no matter what happens out here, it's my fault.
[00:59:28] Guess what?
[00:59:29] Hey, guys, do you understand the RR's?
[00:59:30] Let me talk to you about him.
[00:59:31] Get hey, hey, Dave, do you guys understand where the lines of limits of advance are?
[00:59:36] So you know where you could.
[00:59:37] Just all your guys don't understand.
[00:59:38] Hey, do we see?
[00:59:39] Do we have it marked out clearly?
[00:59:40] Okay, great.
[00:59:41] Hey, do you know, like dig in and when you dig in on stuff, then you have less of a chance of something going wrong.
[00:59:47] But when something does go wrong and you take ownership of it, you take ownership of it.
[00:59:51] Not to avoid trouble, but to face trouble.
[00:59:54] Hmm.
[00:59:56] That's what you have to do.
[00:59:58] So my idea hasn't changed.
[01:00:02] In fact, if I would have blamed someone else and then kept my job and someone else got inspired,
[01:00:09] I would have had a real problem with that.
[01:00:13] I could not have lived with myself.
[01:00:16] I could not have been able to do that.
[01:00:21] I wouldn't have been able to do that.
[01:00:24] And that's why when I was trying to figure out who the blame it on, because I was, because I was looking at this big problem, because there was a lot of bad things.
[01:00:29] And I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm like, okay, who's fault with this?
[01:00:34] And I couldn't figure out why I didn't feel comfortable saying that.
[01:00:45] Saying it was this guy, was that guy?
[01:00:47] It'd be like this guy in the previous one, because it's Bill's fault.
[01:00:51] I don't feel comfortable saying that.
[01:00:53] Especially when I'm in charge, I don't feel comfortable when I'm a peer either.
[01:00:56] If I'm, if my peer, but we're part of a team and something goes wrong, I don't feel comfortable saying it was the other guy.
[01:01:02] Hmm.
[01:01:03] Who does that?
[01:01:04] Who feels good about that, right?
[01:01:06] Don't be that person.
[01:01:08] And only that when you see people acting that way, everybody can identify that that's a bad thing.
[01:01:14] But they do it anyways, because they're ego.
[01:01:17] So keep it in check.
[01:01:20] Yeah.
[01:01:22] Next question.
[01:01:24] Whether directly or indirectly, I know Jockel follows this principle.
[01:01:28] The way you do anything is the way you do everything.
[01:01:31] This is an intro.
[01:01:33] This question, I had to pull out because what you're going to see, it's very, I think it's a question.
[01:01:42] Maybe you might be even more suited to answer than me.
[01:01:45] We'll go ahead and proceed.
[01:01:46] Interesting.
[01:01:47] Now, let's say you're sitting on the couch.
[01:01:50] And you want to switch the light on.
[01:01:52] The switch is to your right.
[01:01:54] And you know there's a 95% chance that you can reach it from where you're sitting without having to leave the couch.
[01:02:00] What do you do?
[01:02:01] Do you take the chance to reach it or to reach for it in vain?
[01:02:06] And then get up.
[01:02:07] Walk to the switch and turn it on.
[01:02:09] Or do you get up right away and make the extra effort and get it done in the most efficient manner, regardless of if there was potentially an easier way.
[01:02:19] I get you.
[01:02:20] I think we know where you sit on this.
[01:02:22] I know I'd love to give some big profound answer about this, but here's the deal.
[01:02:26] I would accurately assess the distance of light switch.
[01:02:29] Oh, accurately.
[01:02:30] Accurately.
[01:02:31] Accurately.
[01:02:32] And I'd figure out the best way to turn it on.
[01:02:34] And then I'd turn it on.
[01:02:35] That's what I do.
[01:02:37] I mean, if I got to get up out of that, I'd get to get better, better bed.
[01:02:40] Or I'd pull a pull.
[01:02:42] We on the couch.
[01:02:43] Is that the situation?
[01:02:45] I want to need the light on.
[01:02:47] So yeah, we'll right get the light on my phone out and see what I got to see with the light.
[01:02:51] Oh, you did that right?
[01:02:52] Because I'm thinking out of the box over on my side.
[01:02:55] That's what I'm doing.
[01:02:56] What you do is as far as the as far as the thing the way you do anything is the way you do everything.
[01:03:00] It's partly true, but at the same time, guess what you got to prioritize next.
[01:03:04] Next. And there are some things that are not as important as other things.
[01:03:11] My famous example is that my gym floor in my home gym is not clean.
[01:03:20] Yep.
[01:03:21] It's there's chalk on it.
[01:03:22] There's some sweat stains.
[01:03:23] I don't go in there three times a week with a mop and swab it and get all the chalk out and power wash it.
[01:03:32] That's what it would take.
[01:03:33] Maybe two times a week if I power washed it, pull all the stuff out of the garage, power wash the mats, pull them back in there, set the garage back up.
[01:03:40] That's what it would take to keep the mats clean.
[01:03:43] That don't care if those mats are cleaner not doesn't matter me.
[01:03:47] Right?
[01:03:47] I have to prioritize there's much, much, much more important things than whether my mats in my garage gym or clean doesn't matter.
[01:03:56] Yeah.
[01:03:57] Did you do mats are different, right?
[01:03:59] Did you do mats got to be clean?
[01:04:00] Yeah.
[01:04:00] Those got to be clean.
[01:04:01] Well, there's what we got people clean those mats after classes.
[01:04:04] Sure.
[01:04:05] That's a priority.
[01:04:06] The ones at my house that just me don't matter.
[01:04:09] That doesn't mean that I'm slacking in other areas.
[01:04:12] Right?
[01:04:13] There's a minimum standard in certain things like there's and even my home gym mats.
[01:04:17] I have a vacuum and I hit them with the vacuum when I get too much dog hair on them.
[01:04:22] Which actually I do that like every one or two days.
[01:04:25] It takes three minutes to just vacuum dog hair.
[01:04:28] Right?
[01:04:29] There's a minimum standard to hold the line.
[01:04:32] And as far as doing things the most efficient way, I try to do things the right way.
[01:04:38] Right?
[01:04:39] Trying to do things the right way.
[01:04:40] Which generally that coincides with the most efficient way.
[01:04:44] Generally.
[01:04:45] Generally.
[01:04:45] There are.
[01:04:46] But here, that's what he's talking about here.
[01:04:48] So when you said, I'm a fifth and a fifth and a fifth.
[01:04:50] Here's a thing man.
[01:04:51] Bro, this guy, you don't, we don't have this name but man, we need to get together and talk.
[01:04:56] This is all of this.
[01:04:57] This is kind of stuff that I think about all the time.
[01:04:59] Not in this obsessive way but in this end of my mind.
[01:05:02] Man, that's a good question too.
[01:05:04] So basically he's asking like, okay.
[01:05:06] And it happens for literally half a second.
[01:05:08] Maybe one whole second.
[01:05:09] Where like, okay man, I need to light on.
[01:05:11] What do I do?
[01:05:12] Do I?
[01:05:13] You know, like how he said, do I reach for it?
[01:05:15] Because that's the easiest way.
[01:05:16] I don't have to stand up.
[01:05:17] He's on my leg and back muscles and stand up and walk over like just reach for it.
[01:05:20] But if I can't reach it.
[01:05:22] Now I got to do, expand all the energy of reaching for it.
[01:05:24] Failing, bringing my hand back and then doing the standing up thing that I was trying to avoid in the first place.
[01:05:29] So it's one of those things.
[01:05:31] So what do I do man?
[01:05:32] What do I do?
[01:05:33] Do I just chance it?
[01:05:34] Or do I just be like, you know, I'm not going to chance anything.
[01:05:36] I'm just going to expand the energy.
[01:05:38] And turn on the light.
[01:05:39] So what do I do?
[01:05:40] Right.
[01:05:40] I mean, to conundrum.
[01:05:41] Same thing with the soy sauce posts.
[01:05:43] Same thing.
[01:05:44] Also here's what here's what you might.
[01:05:45] Did you see the meme?
[01:05:47] Yes.
[01:05:48] There's a couple memes.
[01:05:49] There's a couple memes about you in the soy sauce balls.
[01:05:51] I'm fed three.
[01:05:52] One of them was like a black and white photo.
[01:05:55] Did you see that one?
[01:05:56] I was like a black and white photo, but it said something.
[01:05:59] It was a black and white photo of soy sauce balls.
[01:06:03] Oh yeah.
[01:06:04] What did it say?
[01:06:05] I feel like the strawberry.
[01:06:06] The strawberry was better than the strawberry.
[01:06:08] It was better than the strawberry was real.
[01:06:09] Yeah.
[01:06:10] And then they had the superhero looking guy that had the two buttons.
[01:06:12] Yeah.
[01:06:13] The two buttons.
[01:06:14] Anyway, here's one.
[01:06:16] And here's one that this one's a real problem.
[01:06:19] Small but a real problem for those people.
[01:06:21] When you're laying in bed at night, you're sleeping and you wake up.
[01:06:25] You're like, man, I gotta take it.
[01:06:27] I gotta use bathroom.
[01:06:29] But not too bad.
[01:06:30] I don't have to use bathroom bad just a little bit.
[01:06:33] So what do I do?
[01:06:34] Do I hold it?
[01:06:35] Power through the discomfort because this comfort isn't that bad and hopefully I'll fall asleep.
[01:06:40] Because I don't want to get up and wait myself up more and turn on the light and do all this stuff and walk around
[01:06:44] Get the blood flowing and then what if I can't fall asleep as quick or whatever or I'm tired.
[01:06:47] I don't even want to get out of bed.
[01:06:49] You know, so what do I do?
[01:06:52] Because if I go use a bathroom, oh man, I'll be fully relaxed.
[01:06:55] It'll be done.
[01:06:56] It won't keep me up.
[01:06:57] The discomfort won't keep me up.
[01:06:58] But if I can fall back asleep, I didn't even have to get out of bed.
[01:07:01] I'm just saying.
[01:07:03] So what do you do?
[01:07:04] You're at that.
[01:07:05] And if you really got ease about the misno issue, because it's obvious.
[01:07:08] But if you just have to do a little bit, it's a hard question.
[01:07:11] I can't tell you if you're talking about that.
[01:07:13] Don't even act.
[01:07:14] I know.
[01:07:15] What do you mean?
[01:07:16] I just said that you had problems.
[01:07:17] I've been zero seconds.
[01:07:19] I spend zero seconds thinking about that issue.
[01:07:21] Zero.
[01:07:22] This is no factor whatsoever in my life.
[01:07:24] I'm going to go use bathroom.
[01:07:26] Here's my answer to your question.
[01:07:29] If I have to go to the bathroom, I go to the bathroom.
[01:07:30] What if you kind of have to go to the bathroom?
[01:07:32] There's no kind of thing.
[01:07:33] There's no kind of thing.
[01:07:34] There's no kind of thing.
[01:07:35] I don't want to know.
[01:07:36] Your back is like, if your bladder is full.
[01:07:38] Okay, you got ease about the point.
[01:07:39] What if your bladder is one-third full?
[01:07:40] Then I don't have to go to the bathroom.
[01:07:42] Okay, so you have a distinct cut off then in feelings.
[01:07:46] You don't have that great answer.
[01:07:47] You have that great answer.
[01:07:48] I don't.
[01:07:49] Alright.
[01:07:50] So most of us, we don't have to like that.
[01:07:51] No.
[01:07:52] We've got to like consider.
[01:07:53] No.
[01:07:54] Well the same way that this kind of has to go with.
[01:07:56] No, no, no, no.
[01:07:57] Anyway.
[01:07:58] Anyway.
[01:07:59] I dig it.
[01:08:00] And that's going to be one of those ongoing challenges.
[01:08:03] I think.
[01:08:04] You know?
[01:08:05] I think the main.
[01:08:06] And I almost left that whole second half of the question because the main point
[01:08:09] of the question was the way you do anything is the way you do everything.
[01:08:12] Yes, that's true to a point.
[01:08:13] You should definitely keep, you know.
[01:08:15] You're trying to maintain consistent effort and hold the line and everything.
[01:08:19] But the economy is that if you try and hold the line on every single thing that's not possible
[01:08:23] and you'd spend your whole life cleaning up everything around you and fixing things.
[01:08:27] Yeah.
[01:08:28] What you just, the univ wasting time when you have, you need to prioritize and execute.
[01:08:32] Pick the biggest problems.
[01:08:33] Pick the biggest things you're going to have the most impact on you.
[01:08:35] And then focus on those things and don't worry about some other things.
[01:08:39] Yeah.
[01:08:40] And that's that little conundrum is everywhere.
[01:08:42] But sometimes it'll be vacuuming.
[01:08:45] And then you know how like when you vacuum over like I don't know,
[01:08:47] let's say it's a big piece of land.
[01:08:49] You go over the vacuum once, you know.
[01:08:51] And it doesn't go in.
[01:08:52] You go again.
[01:08:53] It doesn't go in.
[01:08:54] You go, I could have picked that thing up like three, four seconds ago.
[01:08:57] So why didn't you?
[01:08:58] Because I thought I could have, I should get a guy with a vacuum and I wouldn't have to bend down.
[01:09:02] You know what I mean?
[01:09:03] It's like that kind of stuff.
[01:09:04] It depends on the time.
[01:09:05] It's all the time.
[01:09:06] It's a lot of things.
[01:09:07] It's efficiency, not laziness.
[01:09:09] But either way, you know what though?
[01:09:10] It's got you combined with this guy's question and answered the question with how you do everything.
[01:09:15] You just establish a protocol.
[01:09:16] If there's a question, you just do the guaranteed one.
[01:09:18] If I see a piece of the land, I'm a vacuum it.
[01:09:21] It didn't go up, boom, pick it up.
[01:09:22] That's it.
[01:09:23] Maybe you get a double take, right?
[01:09:25] Yeah.
[01:09:26] Because generally you got to go forward and back on a vacuum anyways.
[01:09:28] You know what I'm saying?
[01:09:29] You just rerun that same track.
[01:09:30] Yeah.
[01:09:31] Because you know you're going forward back, but you're offsetting a little bit.
[01:09:35] Yeah.
[01:09:36] And sometimes the back depending on your brush, depending on the back one or the back one.
[01:09:38] Sometimes it's more powerful.
[01:09:40] Okay.
[01:09:41] Because the brush spins a certain way.
[01:09:42] Interesting.
[01:09:43] But either way, yeah.
[01:09:44] But either way you feed.
[01:09:45] Okay.
[01:09:46] And then guess what?
[01:09:47] On the forward stroke, you can go now to your next track and you can bend down grab the
[01:09:51] piece of land.
[01:09:52] You're good to go.
[01:09:53] Yeah.
[01:09:54] So then the point is establish a protocol where it's like, you know what?
[01:09:56] I'm not going to waste my time.
[01:09:57] No.
[01:09:58] You know, risking it and all this stuff.
[01:09:59] I'm just going to go for the real deal.
[01:10:02] Pop them.
[01:10:04] Oh, yeah.
[01:10:05] You know what?
[01:10:06] All right.
[01:10:07] So I'm a firefighter slash EMT, a recently and recently I went on a call where a patient
[01:10:12] didn't live.
[01:10:13] Not unusual by any means.
[01:10:15] Unfortunately, I deal with loss of life on almost a daily basis.
[01:10:19] I detached and do my job always working to get better.
[01:10:23] This call, I failed to detach.
[01:10:25] It hit me hard.
[01:10:26] When the patient's husband let out a chilling, let out chilling screams.
[01:10:31] As his third year old wife went from alert and talking to dead within minutes.
[01:10:37] I let myself enter into his shoes at that moment.
[01:10:40] I got over it quick during my days off and moved on.
[01:10:44] It's part of the job and I accept that.
[01:10:46] But my question is, when does it become inhumane to detach?
[01:10:50] Do we sometimes need to let some weakness through to remain grounded when dealing with such
[01:10:55] major incidents is loss of life?
[01:10:58] Thank you.
[01:10:59] Okay.
[01:11:02] First of all, sympathy and empathy are not weaknesses.
[01:11:05] They're not weaknesses.
[01:11:07] In fact, it actually takes strength to be able to deal with these types of situations
[01:11:14] and these types of emotions.
[01:11:16] The weak move would actually be to cut those emotions off completely.
[01:11:22] So that being said, as you know, obviously there is a dichotomy.
[01:11:31] Because you cannot let the emotions overwhelm you.
[01:11:35] As a matter of fact, if you get overwhelmed by your feelings,
[01:11:40] then you can't do your job properly, which in its own right is inhumane.
[01:11:45] Because now you're not able to treat the patients that you're trying to save.
[01:11:48] Because you're getting too emotional about it.
[01:11:50] So what do you have to do? The answer for the millionth time of a different subject,
[01:11:54] but comes up all the time, you've got to find balance.
[01:11:56] You have to find balance between being emotional enough,
[01:12:00] but not being too emotional. You have to learn to recognize if you're going too far in one direction.
[01:12:07] Or the other, you have to do a self-assessment.
[01:12:09] You have to look and see and make sure that that you see the people you're treating as people.
[01:12:17] You have to look at them and make sure that you're seeing them as people.
[01:12:20] That you're not seeing them as a hunk of meat, right?
[01:12:23] You have to do that. You have to make sure that you're doing that.
[01:12:26] At the same time, you cannot afford emotionally to go through the pain of loss every time you see someone die.
[01:12:35] Because that's also going to be a problem. You can't afford emotionally to do that.
[01:12:40] You can't go through that pain over and over and over again.
[01:12:46] So you have to, like you said, you have to detach and normally do a good job with that.
[01:12:54] Obviously, you guys get wounded.
[01:12:57] I've seen guys get killed. I've been around a lot of death.
[01:13:00] And when it was around me, I didn't have time to stop and think about it.
[01:13:05] I had to work to do. I had to detach myself and do my job.
[01:13:09] At the same time, when it's over and the time was appropriate,
[01:13:14] it's like you've got to connect with what happened and make sure that you are dealing with it appropriately.
[01:13:22] And I always think firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and police and military,
[01:13:28] but paramedics and EMTs, you're only showing up if someone isn't a bad way.
[01:13:35] And I know that's hard physically and it's hard mentally and it's hard emotionally.
[01:13:40] So find a balance, keep yourself balanced, make sure you're not going too far in one direction or the other.
[01:13:49] And thanks for doing your job.
[01:13:53] Man, that's like easy, but sometimes you forget that about EMTs.
[01:13:59] Like that's the only time where they spread.
[01:14:03] I mean, pretty much.
[01:14:04] Yeah, EMTs are getting called because someone is in a bad way.
[01:14:07] That's the whole thing.
[01:14:08] What they're showing up for.
[01:14:10] And cops too.
[01:14:12] It's easy to be on the outside when you're going to parks and if your job is like,
[01:14:19] I don't know, I press record, make videos or whatever.
[01:14:24] And this is like every day.
[01:14:26] So it kind of forms this vision, my world, whatever.
[01:14:30] But EMTs.
[01:14:32] And every time you get to call it, it's just the question is just,
[01:14:36] Oh, how bad.
[01:14:38] You know, that's what it is, how bad, how bad of a situation is the person I'm about to go content with.
[01:14:44] What's their situation?
[01:14:46] They are, they could be everything from a minor situation to they're going to die in front of me.
[01:14:51] Again, this new person, and their life and their kids and their family.
[01:14:56] And you know, Peter T. talked about some of that becoming a bit jaded.
[01:15:02] In fact, it's a pretty horrific story and it's worth listening to that podcast when he was on.
[01:15:08] He talked about how he got to a point where some patients he started to look at like,
[01:15:15] He'd be mad at them, mad at them.
[01:15:18] And that's what you have to avoid is getting to this point.
[01:15:23] You got to do your best to stay emotionally detached enough that you can do your job.
[01:15:30] But at the same time, you can't be looking at other human beings as if they're just a piece of meat.
[01:15:38] So, part job.
[01:15:42] I think we got time for one more question.
[01:15:47] I have good ideas, but I have trouble executing.
[01:15:51] Do you have any tips?
[01:15:56] I have good ideas, but I have trouble executing.
[01:16:01] Do you have any tips?
[01:16:06] Oh yeah.
[01:16:11] You have some good ideas, do you?
[01:16:16] But you can't execute.
[01:16:19] You want to know what those ideas are worth?
[01:16:25] There's nothing.
[01:16:29] Ideas by themselves have zero value unless they can be brought to life.
[01:16:39] And I have known plenty of people with plenty of ideas over the years.
[01:16:46] Great ideas.
[01:16:47] Amazing ideas.
[01:16:49] But very few people can actually turn ideas into action.
[01:16:57] And those people end up old and bitter and angry because they didn't execute their great ideas.
[01:17:04] And so here's what you do.
[01:17:06] You execute.
[01:17:09] You actually make things happen.
[01:17:12] And sometimes I'm going to tell you when you execute your idea,
[01:17:16] it reveals the fact that your idea isn't all that good.
[01:17:21] It's not the brilliant idea you thought it was.
[01:17:24] And some people are actually afraid of that.
[01:17:26] And that's what stops them.
[01:17:28] But I'm not afraid.
[01:17:30] I say, but bring on that failure.
[01:17:33] Let me learn that my idea is no good.
[01:17:38] Because even if you learn that your idea is garbage,
[01:17:42] you know not to waste any more time dreaming about it or thinking about it.
[01:17:47] Go on to your next idea.
[01:17:50] But don't let these ideas just wander aimlessly around in your head.
[01:17:55] Get them out.
[01:17:58] Bring them to life, put them into the world, run with them.
[01:18:02] And get some friends and family or partners.
[01:18:06] Someone to help you.
[01:18:07] Maybe get some people that are better at execution than you are.
[01:18:10] And give them some ownership.
[01:18:12] Give away those ideas.
[01:18:13] It's better to give away those ideas than let them rot inside your head and die.
[01:18:22] And whatever path you take, whether you force yourself to execute or you bring people into help you,
[01:18:29] whatever path you're going to take, do it.
[01:18:31] Do it.
[01:18:32] Pour some life into your idea.
[01:18:36] And like I said, you've got to remember that there's no guarantee that when you pour life into idea,
[01:18:47] into an idea, there's no guarantee that that idea is going to come to life too.
[01:18:52] You might pour everything you've got to that idea and it can still die.
[01:18:57] And you might have to let it die.
[01:19:02] You have to let the dream die because some ideas aren't good enough to live.
[01:19:07] That's just the way it is.
[01:19:08] But you know what?
[01:19:11] At least give it a chance.
[01:19:15] Don't let that idea die inside your head.
[01:19:19] No more waiting, no more putting it off or waiting for the right time or the right people or the right alignment of things in the world.
[01:19:27] No more of that, no more excuses, just execution.
[01:19:34] Just go and make it happen.
[01:19:43] And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[01:19:49] So echo Charlie while we are over here trying to make things happen.
[01:19:56] So we have to go hard.
[01:19:59] We have to execute.
[01:20:00] You got anything that could possibly help us execute.
[01:20:04] Yeah.
[01:20:05] Our mission.
[01:20:06] Sure.
[01:20:07] Where do you go?
[01:20:09] Well, talk about origin first.
[01:20:11] This is an outstanding way to execute and maintain the execution.
[01:20:17] So while we are doing you just to and you don't know what kind of get it yet, which would be crazy.
[01:20:24] But hey, people are starting every day.
[01:20:27] And when you start you do have that question.
[01:20:29] Most of the time.
[01:20:30] What's the maximum age for starting GJ2?
[01:20:33] Death.
[01:20:34] I think it's the day before you die.
[01:20:36] The day before that could be 100, whatever.
[01:20:38] Yeah.
[01:20:39] The reason you don't start the day before you die is you don't want to go to your deathbed with regret.
[01:20:44] Because as soon as you even learn a little bit of GJ2, you be like dang.
[01:20:47] I wish I would have started that a month ago.
[01:20:49] Yes.
[01:20:50] Month of solid GJ2.
[01:20:55] Yeah.
[01:20:56] Yeah.
[01:20:57] So yeah.
[01:20:58] We have people all the time starting GJ2 all ages from four or five.
[01:21:03] Below that, yes, you should be training.
[01:21:05] Your little kids should be trained GJ2.
[01:21:06] But it's more of a playful thing that you do with them because you know the techniques.
[01:21:09] And you have them escape the mountain.
[01:21:11] You start to have them arm lock you.
[01:21:12] You start to have them put in that rear naked choke.
[01:21:14] You got to make sure you tell them that the rear naked choke is dangerous and not to do it.
[01:21:17] If you're not around because that is actually a scary thing.
[01:21:20] I used to be a little bit nervous about that when my kids were real little.
[01:21:24] Yeah.
[01:21:25] They know how to rear naked choke.
[01:21:26] You know, oh, maybe my five year old daughter slaps a rear naked choke on my two year old son.
[01:21:32] Right.
[01:21:33] And decides, you know, to hang onto that thing because he's crying or whatever.
[01:21:37] So you got to be very careful with that.
[01:21:40] Yeah.
[01:21:41] Yeah.
[01:21:42] And that's a simple deal where it's not like a knife or something.
[01:21:46] Or something where it's like, hey, this is dangerous.
[01:21:48] Don't you know, it's like, it's a little bit more cut in dry with the rear naked choke.
[01:21:52] It's kind of like, okay, you have to deliberately apply the choke and execute the choke for it to be dangerous.
[01:22:01] Not like a knife or something.
[01:22:03] If you got little tiny kids below the, like,
[01:22:06] For two, three, four, five, yes, you teach them basic moves.
[01:22:11] You need to explain to them that the moves are real.
[01:22:15] Yeah.
[01:22:16] And they do work.
[01:22:18] And that's I always warn the little kids about the ones kids are a little bit older than they understand.
[01:22:23] Because it happens them and they know what's going on.
[01:22:25] So be careful with that part of Jiu Jitsu for the little kids, but whether kids are.
[01:22:31] For or whether you're 60 or 70 or 80 years old, go get your Jiu Jitsu on.
[01:22:36] Going to need a G.
[01:22:38] The G and or a Rascart action or Rascart.
[01:22:40] And the Rascart.
[01:22:41] At least one.
[01:22:42] So what kind of G, origin, G.
[01:22:44] Planeted choose from.
[01:22:45] Planeted choose from.
[01:22:46] Planeted.
[01:22:47] Increasing by the as time goes on.
[01:22:49] Straight up.
[01:22:50] All made in America.
[01:22:52] And factually the besties in the world.
[01:22:55] Yeah.
[01:22:56] And when you buy an origin G, you are.
[01:23:01] You are investing not only in yourself, but you're also investing in this great country.
[01:23:08] As we rebuild manufacturing inside our country, bringing back the old New England factories
[01:23:15] that they sent overseas.
[01:23:17] We're bringing it back.
[01:23:18] We're actually bringing it back.
[01:23:20] We are.
[01:23:21] We're buying equipment back from overseas.
[01:23:24] Bringing it back here on ships.
[01:23:26] Can you imagine that's happening right now?
[01:23:28] We are doing that.
[01:23:29] You are doing that.
[01:23:30] You are making that happen.
[01:23:32] Also.
[01:23:33] We got jeans.
[01:23:34] Here's the deal.
[01:23:36] I talked to Pete.
[01:23:37] Pete Roberts.
[01:23:38] Origin.
[01:23:39] I said, Pete, how many people do you know the dude, G, G, G, G?
[01:23:42] And he's like, oh, 100.
[01:23:45] I said, how many people do you know that own pair of jeans?
[01:23:48] And he said, 200 million.
[01:23:51] I said, we need to make jeans.
[01:23:54] Everyone wants jeans.
[01:23:55] Everyone needs jeans.
[01:23:56] Everyone would want jeans that are not only high quality, but also made in America.
[01:24:03] They're sold by craftsmen in Maine.
[01:24:07] So, yeah, we got Origin jeans.
[01:24:11] They're awesome.
[01:24:12] We got American denim.
[01:24:13] American denim.
[01:24:15] Like it.
[01:24:16] Cotton cotton.
[01:24:17] Cotton yes.
[01:24:18] Yeah, sewn here.
[01:24:19] Later jean.
[01:24:20] So is it grown?
[01:24:21] There you go.
[01:24:22] I was probably Pete Roberts had come up with that one.
[01:24:24] Yeah.
[01:24:25] A grown and so on in America.
[01:24:26] Baby.
[01:24:27] Boom.
[01:24:28] There it is.
[01:24:29] But also joggers.
[01:24:30] Speaking of pants.
[01:24:31] You're not allowed to do joggers, but for us who like comfort and functionality.
[01:24:40] Maybe a twist to style, whatever this one is.
[01:24:43] Why don't we keep bringing up joggers specifically?
[01:24:46] Is it because of my experience with the joggers?
[01:24:48] I like the joggers.
[01:24:49] People like joggers.
[01:24:50] And you can also get supplements.
[01:24:51] We have supplements.
[01:24:52] We have joint warfare.
[01:24:53] We have acrylic.
[01:24:54] We have discipline.
[01:24:55] We have discipline.
[01:24:56] Go.
[01:24:57] According to JP D'Nell.
[01:24:58] When he takes discipline go, he can see people's thoughts.
[01:25:03] Yeah.
[01:25:04] I'm like, he was so fired up.
[01:25:07] He did a, you know, an event for us long front.
[01:25:09] He's like, he's like, I was so fired up.
[01:25:11] I could see people's thoughts.
[01:25:12] And I'm like, I like the way that sounds.
[01:25:14] So discipline go.
[01:25:15] Little new trophic to get the mind kicking.
[01:25:19] And then you got discipline for pre-workout.
[01:25:21] Crayloil.
[01:25:22] Joy warfare.
[01:25:23] Keep the bones.
[01:25:25] The tendons.
[01:25:26] Legiments.
[01:25:27] Legiments.
[01:25:27] Keep all that stuff.
[01:25:29] Good to go.
[01:25:30] Maintained.
[01:25:31] Uninflation.
[01:25:32] So there's inflammation.
[01:25:33] What's the anti-inflammation?
[01:25:35] So keep them anti-inflammed.
[01:25:37] Keep them moving.
[01:25:38] Keep them lubricated.
[01:25:39] Keep them functioning.
[01:25:41] Very important.
[01:25:42] And in milk.
[01:25:43] We got milk.
[01:25:44] Some people don't even know what milk is.
[01:25:47] And it's really easy to explain.
[01:25:49] Milk is milk.
[01:25:50] Yeah.
[01:25:51] It happens to have what 22 grams of protein in there.
[01:25:55] Yeah.
[01:25:56] And protein.
[01:25:57] Two by the way.
[01:25:58] Which is different.
[01:25:59] You know?
[01:26:00] And it's delicious.
[01:26:01] You have very delicious.
[01:26:02] And that was, I'll talk to my friend Kenny.
[01:26:04] The other day.
[01:26:05] He's like, oh yeah.
[01:26:06] So we're all doing two special about this thing.
[01:26:08] And I got past a detached, you know.
[01:26:10] I got past your emotional effort.
[01:26:12] A little bit emotional.
[01:26:13] But I was like, I started like going into this whole pitch to my friend.
[01:26:16] By the way, it turned out to be a pitch.
[01:26:18] But just like how it's all clean.
[01:26:20] And we, you know, monk fruit to sweeten it.
[01:26:22] And it's like, doesn't taste like some diet.
[01:26:24] I think whatever's like a dessert at the end of the day.
[01:26:26] I think I think you accepted the pitch.
[01:26:28] The best thing to do if someone wants to know, you get mixed one up.
[01:26:31] Yeah.
[01:26:32] Because when as soon as you mix one up, people are like, oh, yeah.
[01:26:34] I'm going to get it.
[01:26:35] I'm getting this now.
[01:26:36] Because how can this be good for you?
[01:26:37] Yeah.
[01:26:38] That's the question.
[01:26:39] How can this be good for you?
[01:26:40] Yeah.
[01:26:41] Tastes like that.
[01:26:42] True.
[01:26:43] Mid chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, vanilla gorilla.
[01:26:46] Darkness, the chocolate.
[01:26:47] The darkness.
[01:26:48] Darkness.
[01:26:49] And then there's this is what I believe to be kind of epic.
[01:26:53] Warrior kid milk.
[01:26:55] Yes.
[01:26:56] Because warrior kid milk, you can go to your grocery store.
[01:26:59] And you can buy something that will flavor the milk.
[01:27:02] So that your kids will drink milk.
[01:27:04] But while your drink while you're giving the milk,
[01:27:07] you're also giving them poison.
[01:27:10] You.
[01:27:11] Right.
[01:27:12] Sugar poison or is enough.
[01:27:13] Yeah.
[01:27:14] You're going to eat enough sugar that you die.
[01:27:15] Yeah.
[01:27:16] Right.
[01:27:17] People do it all the time.
[01:27:18] They get diabetes.
[01:27:19] Yeah.
[01:27:20] So we don't want to give our kids poison.
[01:27:22] We want to give them power.
[01:27:24] How do we do it?
[01:27:25] We got warrior kid milk.
[01:27:26] We got strawberry and chocolate.
[01:27:28] They taste amazing.
[01:27:29] They are engineered.
[01:27:31] The best possible food that your kids
[01:27:33] Gonna eat.
[01:27:35] Yeah.
[01:27:36] Think about it.
[01:27:37] You can say, oh, you want some dessert.
[01:27:38] And they're get all excited.
[01:27:39] Here, have a strawberry milkshake.
[01:27:41] And what do they think?
[01:27:43] Thank you.
[01:27:44] Yeah.
[01:27:45] Can I have more?
[01:27:46] And you know what you say?
[01:27:47] Sure.
[01:27:48] Of course you can.
[01:27:49] You can have all you want.
[01:27:50] Yeah.
[01:27:51] And probiotics and vitamins.
[01:27:53] This is everything you're supposed to be eating as a child to grow up and be strong.
[01:27:57] And a world beater.
[01:27:59] You.
[01:28:00] The time.
[01:28:02] All right.
[01:28:03] Check.
[01:28:04] Yes.
[01:28:05] Okay.
[01:28:06] Also, if you want to stay in the bath and represent at the same time.
[01:28:08] A tire wise.
[01:28:10] Chocolate store.
[01:28:11] It's called Jocco store.
[01:28:12] So you're going to jocco store.com.
[01:28:14] That's where you can get your t-shirts.
[01:28:17] More trash.
[01:28:18] And it's good to have more than one rash card for multiple reasons.
[01:28:23] One is that if one gets dirty, you don't have to rush to wash it or rush to get it back in the rotation.
[01:28:28] And necessarily.
[01:28:29] It could be a whole decision making process.
[01:28:31] You got to deal with it.
[01:28:32] It's possible.
[01:28:33] It's possible.
[01:28:34] It's possible.
[01:28:35] Yes.
[01:28:36] But you know what I ran into.
[01:28:37] And this is so psychological.
[01:28:39] So I, you know, I, whatever, I have a bunch of rash cards.
[01:28:42] So I get injured wearing this one rash card.
[01:28:44] And I, I don't, why are it anymore?
[01:28:46] Because I'm like, oh, it made me injured.
[01:28:48] Yeah.
[01:28:49] You think superstition.
[01:28:50] Yeah.
[01:28:51] But he's think I know that superstition is fake.
[01:28:53] But you know what I'm superstitious about?
[01:28:56] Being superstitious.
[01:28:57] No, no, I don't care.
[01:28:58] Yeah, see if it's hurt than hurt you bro.
[01:29:00] I know, bro.
[01:29:01] I know exactly what hurt me.
[01:29:02] That's what makes it even worse.
[01:29:03] Either way.
[01:29:04] Whether that's your,
[01:29:05] Are you going to retire the rash card that you wore today?
[01:29:07] When were you training?
[01:29:09] No.
[01:29:10] No.
[01:29:11] No.
[01:29:11] Are you sure?
[01:29:12] No.
[01:29:12] Cause.
[01:29:13] I can't see.
[01:29:16] I see what you did there.
[01:29:18] No, that none of the way.
[01:29:19] Rascar to work today was all good.
[01:29:21] It was, the problem I had today was psychological.
[01:29:24] And it wasn't really actually you were my problem.
[01:29:27] Straight up.
[01:29:28] You were my problem.
[01:29:29] Yeah.
[01:29:30] That's the extreme.
[01:29:31] I thought it was funny though.
[01:29:33] For all my jiditsu career, you know, if I have a good role with someone
[01:29:36] and I, and I, and I, you know, do good against them.
[01:29:39] A lot of times they say,
[01:29:41] you're really strong, right?
[01:29:43] They never say like, oh, you got good jiditsu.
[01:29:45] They never say, oh, like I liked your guard passing.
[01:29:48] Or, hey, you got a really good hit movement.
[01:29:51] No, they don't say that.
[01:29:52] Whether they say is you're strong.
[01:29:54] Yeah.
[01:29:55] That's what they say.
[01:29:56] Mm.
[01:29:57] Today I got my first kind of alternate compliment from echo Charles.
[01:30:01] You didn't say I was strong?
[01:30:03] No.
[01:30:04] You said I psychologically destroyed you.
[01:30:07] Yeah.
[01:30:08] I know.
[01:30:12] What was the whole thing?
[01:30:13] Okay, so you and you've been doing this kind of recently where like,
[01:30:17] I can't, I don't even have to be breathing hard, but just maybe just a little.
[01:30:20] You'll like act.
[01:30:21] You'll be like, put on this little shirt.
[01:30:23] Like, oh, like, or all like push here or something.
[01:30:25] You're like, oh, man.
[01:30:26] Like, you won't say that, but your body will be like, oh, that push is so hard.
[01:30:30] So you'll do that.
[01:30:31] And I know what you're doing.
[01:30:32] Obviously, because you make it obvious, but then what that does to me is like,
[01:30:36] man, it's like,
[01:30:37] you don't really take me seriously right now.
[01:30:40] So it kind of makes nothing angry, but a little bit like frustrated because I'm trying to do a little.
[01:30:45] Something else.
[01:30:46] It sounds like something.
[01:30:47] And then yeah, then when you wind up like doing things and then I'll kind of look at you and kind of feel.
[01:30:55] And then you do this real good normal face kind of scenario.
[01:30:58] And I think that I can do good normal face too, but on the inside, I don't feel normal face.
[01:31:03] But all I see is like, you're just, just being whatever.
[01:31:06] And it doesn't look like just so you don't on the inside and the outside, you don't.
[01:31:10] On the inside, you don't feel normal face.
[01:31:12] It doesn't look normal on the outside.
[01:31:14] It looks pretty evident what's happening.
[01:31:16] Well, I don't know.
[01:31:18] Yeah, at the end of the day, it's sort of just crept in.
[01:31:20] And yeah, I didn't, like, maintain the composure that I think is required to function at a, you know, at a better level than I did today.
[01:31:30] Put it that way.
[01:31:31] And the thing is, right when the timer goes off when we're done,
[01:31:34] it's like, it's like a avalanche of like,
[01:31:37] She's elective.
[01:31:39] It's not shame.
[01:31:40] I always think it's all part of the process.
[01:31:42] No matter how long and painful the process is.
[01:31:45] Did you come in today with, with a good positive attitude on the, what the outcome was going to be?
[01:31:52] Yeah.
[01:31:52] Do you feel good today?
[01:31:53] Yes.
[01:31:54] So, and it, just to be accurate, like, I don't, we always joke about this, but I don't come in thinking
[01:32:00] you're, can you just do it?
[01:32:05] Yeah, you're not positive.
[01:32:06] Are you sure about that?
[01:32:07] I don't think of that.
[01:32:08] I know for a fact there's been days where you've come in, you, I can see it in your eyes.
[01:32:12] You're thinking, I can do this today.
[01:32:14] Well, not be, well, right?
[01:32:17] I do think that yes, I can do this.
[01:32:19] But it's not up and you kind of sometimes you bow up out of fear.
[01:32:23] You just trying to convince yourself, you're trying to be like a peacock, right?
[01:32:26] Sometimes that happens.
[01:32:27] That's cool.
[01:32:28] I don't hold it against you. I just accept it.
[01:32:30] But sometimes you actually think like today's the big day.
[01:32:33] And when I see that look, yeah, I think, okay.
[01:32:36] Well, it's not about, like, okay, I'm going to like beat up, Joc.
[01:32:40] It's not that.
[01:32:41] It's more that, like I have a handful of things.
[01:32:44] The handful is all you need to do is capitalize on one mistake.
[01:32:47] Yeah.
[01:32:48] That's all that it is.
[01:32:49] Yeah.
[01:32:49] You can just play the numbers game now, you know?
[01:32:52] You're, you're good enough at your jutsu now.
[01:32:54] If I make a mistake, you can capitalize on it.
[01:32:56] You can just, you can just play the odds.
[01:32:58] I can beat you 100 times and I can beat you 100 times,
[01:33:01] or I can tap you out.
[01:33:02] No, we don't even care.
[01:33:04] It doesn't even, it doesn't even mean anything.
[01:33:06] You roll the dice one time and you get snake eyes.
[01:33:09] You get the big win.
[01:33:10] Yeah.
[01:33:11] That's where it's at.
[01:33:12] Yeah, it'd be at 7 or 11, but yeah, well, sorry.
[01:33:14] So, done not all good.
[01:33:15] Yeah, it's like an insurgent situation for sure.
[01:33:17] Yeah, yeah, you can smash me all you want, but it'll get you one time and never stay.
[01:33:22] Yeah.
[01:33:23] And it's normally not, like, I'm not necessarily trying to get it.
[01:33:26] Actually, most of the time, pretty much all the time,
[01:33:28] I'm not trying to, like, the goal is never to tap anyone out today.
[01:33:32] It's not that it's like to, to practice new things that I feel like I'm getting a hold of.
[01:33:37] Okay.
[01:33:38] Again, certain levels of people.
[01:33:40] And then, so you're not trying to tap me out.
[01:33:42] Well, that, of course I am, but that's not like the goal for that day.
[01:33:46] You know, it's kind of thing.
[01:33:47] It's more like, okay, I'm going to put together this, like, defense and combine with this little thing and whatever.
[01:33:52] And for you, it's real specific because it's like rolling with you isn't like this,
[01:33:56] it's like, very specific scenario.
[01:33:58] And which includes the psychological part.
[01:34:02] Yeah.
[01:34:02] And that's why I noticed a psychological devastation that you sort of had today is because after the time the time went off we're done,
[01:34:10] it all came to me like, man, you just got destroyed psychologically so bad.
[01:34:15] That goal is that you had for that specific role and for all roles with chocolate today.
[01:34:19] Like literally didn't have anything to do with the role that you just did.
[01:34:22] I don't go right now.
[01:34:23] Because of like your whole mindset, you know, and it was all because of stuff you're doing.
[01:34:28] And here's the kind of the dichotomy of it.
[01:34:31] It's like super fun when it happens.
[01:34:33] But because it's like the frustration is like pushing you know,
[01:34:37] but then it's like at the end of the day, it's all just one big game, you know.
[01:34:41] But it, it, there's a legitimate amount of frustration in there.
[01:34:45] It's funny because I can see that dichotomy in your face.
[01:34:49] Like I can tell that you're mad, but I can also tell that it's fun.
[01:34:52] You know, but you do get frustrated.
[01:34:54] Yeah, but sometimes you get legitimately like, like you make noises.
[01:35:00] Like frustration like groans or grouse.
[01:35:03] You know what I mean?
[01:35:04] Yeah, but it's like at, you know how like when then you know what else you'll do?
[01:35:08] Let's go again right now.
[01:35:10] Right? Like a little kid. Like a six year old.
[01:35:12] I know real, but the thing is like for a, and I say from the outside,
[01:35:16] I can see how that could, you know what I don't like.
[01:35:18] You know what I don't like.
[01:35:19] You know what I don't like is when I tap someone out.
[01:35:23] Let's say I'm in, I'm in a half guard and I tap someone out with something.
[01:35:28] And I let go.
[01:35:30] And then they're like, then they want to keep going like, as if that just didn't happen.
[01:35:34] Oh, from that exact position.
[01:35:35] You know, like that to me today.
[01:35:37] Yeah. And I was like, I mean, it's not, it's not like it's a big deal.
[01:35:40] But I was, I then I'm like, okay, because you know, I mean, I did whatever move I did.
[01:35:46] And then I let go, you tap and then I let go of it.
[01:35:50] Right.
[01:35:51] And then it's like, we'll just keep going.
[01:35:53] Yeah.
[01:35:54] And I'm like, what, what, why would we keep going?
[01:35:56] You just, you just submitted.
[01:35:58] Yeah.
[01:35:59] And there's other, the other thing is sometimes people,
[01:36:02] I think you've done this to me like maybe 10 times.
[01:36:05] No, maybe five times where you tap.
[01:36:08] And then like, I let go. And then you like come at me.
[01:36:11] Like you like you like double leg or whatever you like grab.
[01:36:14] And you try it.
[01:36:15] You know, and that's another one.
[01:36:17] I'm like, okay.
[01:36:18] Yeah.
[01:36:18] I see where I see how this is going.
[01:36:20] And I think you're doing that out of frustration.
[01:36:22] Yeah.
[01:36:22] Taurus chili.
[01:36:23] Partially out of like, you understand sometimes you want to learn what just happened, right?
[01:36:28] Like he put me back in that position.
[01:36:30] Yes.
[01:36:30] Cool.
[01:36:31] Yeah.
[01:36:32] I get that part too.
[01:36:33] And even that kind of bothers me again.
[01:36:35] But I could see, you know what, though, from an offensive standpoint,
[01:36:39] like from your position and someone's like, okay, we start from there.
[01:36:42] It's kind of like, you know the, it's like, not linear,
[01:36:46] but you know the path of, like, from start to finish that whole path is like a big
[01:36:51] creative learning battle fight twins losses like a, it's a whole path.
[01:36:56] I think that's why it bothers me because I like that whole thing.
[01:37:01] Yeah.
[01:37:01] And I completed that whole thing.
[01:37:03] Yeah.
[01:37:04] Yeah.
[01:37:05] That whole thing of, because let's face it.
[01:37:07] It's a big.
[01:37:08] There's a lot of things that go on.
[01:37:10] There's a lot of things that happen from from, we start rolling or you start rolling with someone
[01:37:15] to someone submits.
[01:37:17] There's all kinds of things.
[01:37:18] Especially you're starting standing.
[01:37:20] You got to take down a contend with.
[01:37:21] You got guard passing.
[01:37:22] You got guard recovery.
[01:37:23] You got switch.
[01:37:24] Get all these things to get to this point where you can actually submit somebody.
[01:37:27] Yeah.
[01:37:28] And all of a sudden we're just going to skip 85% of that battle, which by the way,
[01:37:32] from my perspective, all that time, all that battle is I'm maneuvering the whole time.
[01:37:40] You know what I mean?
[01:37:41] Yeah.
[01:37:42] It's like a part of my game.
[01:37:43] It's all part of me getting that submission.
[01:37:46] Sommission doesn't start when I hit the mat.
[01:37:48] The submission, it starts before we shake hands.
[01:37:50] That whole.
[01:37:51] You know what I'm saying?
[01:37:52] Yeah.
[01:37:53] So when we skip a big chunk of the, I like that whole part of the battle.
[01:37:56] Yeah.
[01:37:57] So when we skip it, I just feel like, oh, that's kind of weird.
[01:37:59] Yeah.
[01:38:00] And I just jumped to the end of the good song that has the guitar solo.
[01:38:04] Like, no, you got to listen the whole song, man.
[01:38:06] Yeah.
[01:38:07] I appreciate that thing.
[01:38:08] You're right.
[01:38:09] A good movie, right?
[01:38:11] Let's just skip to the scene where the battle takes place.
[01:38:14] You have you ever done that?
[01:38:15] You just watch the battle scene.
[01:38:16] It's not as good as when you watch the whole.
[01:38:18] Right.
[01:38:18] You're going to want to hear the whole.
[01:38:20] I want the whole build up to take place.
[01:38:21] Yeah.
[01:38:22] I just want to watch the battle scene.
[01:38:23] Yeah.
[01:38:24] That's actually, that's good.
[01:38:25] And I might actually glide that we kind of analyze it because,
[01:38:28] Yeah.
[01:38:31] Because it could be looked at.
[01:38:32] I always looked at it because I've done that.
[01:38:34] Like, I don't always do that.
[01:38:36] No, actually.
[01:38:37] You've done it probably five times.
[01:38:39] We've rolled thousands of times.
[01:38:41] Yeah.
[01:38:42] And it's like, okay, can we start from there kind of thing?
[01:38:44] And it's a little bit different.
[01:38:46] A little bit different is like, hey, can you just,
[01:38:48] wait, put that back on me?
[01:38:50] Let me see if I could get out.
[01:38:52] Okay, you got out cool now.
[01:38:53] We'll start again.
[01:38:54] Right.
[01:38:55] Right.
[01:38:55] Now, I'm not talking about that.
[01:38:56] Yeah.
[01:38:57] Yeah.
[01:38:58] Yeah.
[01:38:59] Yeah.
[01:38:59] Yeah.
[01:39:00] Yeah.
[01:39:01] Yeah.
[01:39:02] Yeah.
[01:39:03] Yeah.
[01:39:03] Yeah.
[01:39:04] That was made.
[01:39:05] And I've done that before.
[01:39:06] Really rarely.
[01:39:07] But I looked at it as shoot.
[01:39:08] That was like a plot.
[01:39:09] Like, I made a legitimate mistake right there.
[01:39:11] Let me like get back in that mindset and continue actually rolling.
[01:39:14] I think that's part of what bothers me.
[01:39:16] Yeah.
[01:39:17] It's not up to me.
[01:39:18] I think part of what bothers me is I think to myself.
[01:39:20] Oh, you just made this little mistake.
[01:39:22] And it was kind of a flu.
[01:39:23] Right.
[01:39:24] That's what you're implying is like, oh, this is just a little flu.
[01:39:26] And it's like, you're lucky that won't happen again.
[01:39:28] Yeah.
[01:39:29] That's like, sometimes people get mad when I submit them.
[01:39:32] Not very rarely.
[01:39:34] And I'm always like, man, is that much of an insult that I just sat to.
[01:39:39] You know what I mean?
[01:39:40] Yeah.
[01:39:41] Like, I'm not.
[01:39:42] When somebody taps me on, I'm not mad at them.
[01:39:43] Oh.
[01:39:44] I'm like, dang.
[01:39:45] Nice job.
[01:39:46] That was awesome.
[01:39:47] Good job.
[01:39:48] Yeah.
[01:39:49] But yeah.
[01:39:50] I think people are mean anyway.
[01:39:51] It's like any time when we get like anything's out of frustration.
[01:39:53] It's literally like maybe a 30% frustration, 70% you're just a guy that can take that kind of abuse.
[01:40:00] You know, like, if you're like, okay, good, you know, you got me out.
[01:40:03] And then you turn your back to reset.
[01:40:05] And yeah, jump on your back or take it on whatever.
[01:40:08] Like you can do that normally.
[01:40:10] Yeah.
[01:40:11] Yeah.
[01:40:11] Yeah.
[01:40:11] No.
[01:40:12] And even when you do it to me, it's not like you.
[01:40:13] You haven't ever like jumped and like put a rear-note could choke on or something like that.
[01:40:17] Yeah.
[01:40:18] You've kind of jumped into a slightly advantageous, but normal position for us to be in.
[01:40:22] Yeah.
[01:40:23] Which is no big deal.
[01:40:24] Yeah.
[01:40:24] You have taken my back a couple times.
[01:40:26] Yeah.
[01:40:27] But and then even then like, bro, we've been in this thing for long time where it's.
[01:40:32] Let's say I got it.
[01:40:33] Maybe that might, would that even bother you?
[01:40:35] Let's say I jump on your back in one of those situations.
[01:40:37] Then I got the rear-note get you.
[01:40:38] Yeah.
[01:40:39] And I finished it.
[01:40:40] You, well, I would kind of be like, well, we both know.
[01:40:43] You know, like, right?
[01:40:44] It's very catchy.
[01:40:45] Yeah.
[01:40:46] I took it down.
[01:40:47] Yeah.
[01:40:48] But real quick, back to the, uh, the path.
[01:40:50] You know, like, when you, when you want to, like, you double guy out any once to start from that same position or whatever.
[01:40:55] Yeah.
[01:40:56] If you look at that path, that whole path that is so, let's, this, this, that's a valuable path.
[01:41:01] Every path that you create.
[01:41:03] It's like learning and it's this big thing and it's fun.
[01:41:05] There's little competitiveness in there, whatever.
[01:41:07] And at the end, you finish each path as like this tree or whatever.
[01:41:11] It's done.
[01:41:12] You finish it with your submission when you win or when you lose.
[01:41:15] To entraining or even in competition.
[01:41:17] You win or you lose.
[01:41:18] You can't, like, after you win and complete your masterpiece path of wins and losing in a through the whole thing and you're done.
[01:41:26] That guy just can't step in and be like, no, it's not done.
[01:41:29] It's just sort of paused on my, like, right, you can't jump in and dictate that.
[01:41:32] So if you lost, rather than you've got to start all over and try to create something else.
[01:41:35] No, you know, try to do try new song.
[01:41:37] You can't just, oh, yeah.
[01:41:38] But at the same time.
[01:41:41] If you're looking at, like, training rolling as just practice, just training.
[01:41:47] Just, you know, whatever.
[01:41:48] And so, yeah.
[01:41:49] There's a big difference between, hey, we're going to actually practice right now.
[01:41:53] And we're going to roll.
[01:41:55] Yeah, because rolling is understood that is competitive.
[01:41:57] That's the whole reason it works so good.
[01:41:59] Yeah.
[01:42:00] It has to be competitive.
[01:42:01] So yes, that's why when you taught me out, I do consider it.
[01:42:03] No matter how much percentage, whatever.
[01:42:05] I do consider it.
[01:42:06] You beat me straight up in practice and training.
[01:42:08] You beat me because there's a significant amount of competition right there.
[01:42:12] So yeah, you can't be messing with the other guys wins and do that.
[01:42:16] Yeah.
[01:42:17] You're right.
[01:42:18] I can't, I'm never doing that ever again.
[01:42:19] If you want to do it, it's fine.
[01:42:20] I'm the same.
[01:42:21] It's not.
[01:42:22] It's not fine.
[01:42:23] I'm not doing it.
[01:42:24] I don't want to be that guy to do it, even.
[01:42:25] It's being that guy.
[01:42:26] Nonetheless, back to representing on Jockel's from Jockel's store.

[01:46:45] That's having kind of normal trouble that kids have.
[01:46:48] But he's got an uncle, uncle Jake.
[01:46:51] Who used to be in the team.
[01:46:53] Somebody comes and tells us, cousin out.
[01:46:55] Yeah, this is, cousin is his nephew.

[01:47:02] Mark's mission and where there's a will.
[01:47:04] His book, three, also just put in equals freedom field manual.
[01:47:10] That's a book that you need.
[01:47:12] Or it's a book you can give.
[01:47:14] I'm super stoked when I meet people and they say,
[01:47:17] Yep, I've given 28 copies of the Disponucle freedom field menu
[01:47:21] or a way to other people and my family, other friends that I have.
[01:47:24] I, because it will help people get on the path and live a better life.
[01:47:31] That's a powerful thing.
[01:47:32] If you can actually help someone live a better life,
[01:47:35] there's a manual on how to live your life.
[01:47:37] It's called the Disponucle Freedom Field Manual.
[01:47:40] It's not a normal book.
[01:47:42] It's not normal.
[01:47:44] My publisher, when he was publishing it,
[01:47:47] he said this book is the biggest risk that he has ever taken
[01:47:51] in his publishing career.
[01:47:53] And he also said, and we're actually my agent told me once the book came out.
[01:47:59] The book sold more than any scenario that they had predicted for the book.
[01:48:07] So they, you know, they do these predictions.
[01:48:09] If it sells, it sells, it sells, it sells, it sells, it sells,
[01:48:11] it sells, it sells, the other thing.
[01:48:12] There's something called 100% cell through rate,
[01:48:16] which means every single book that got shipped got sold.
[01:48:20] It does not happen. And then they're back ordered and had to make more.
[01:48:23] Now the book is still selling like that.
[01:48:26] Disponucle Freedom Field Manual.
[01:48:29] Why does it keep selling?
[01:48:30] Because people read it and they get it for people they know.
[01:48:32] So check it out.
[01:48:33] It is the manual telling you how to get on the path and stay on the path.
[01:48:38] The audio version of that book is not on audible.
[01:48:41] It's on iTunes.
[01:48:42] It's on Amazon.
[01:48:43] Music, it's on Google Play and other MP3 platforms.
[01:48:46] Of course, there is extreme ownership.
[01:48:48] The first book that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin, about the combat leadership principles that we learn on the battlefield and how you can apply them to your business and life.
[01:48:57] And we followed that book up with the book called the dichotomy and leadership, which,
[01:49:02] well, some people are saying, it's better than extreme ownership.
[01:49:06] Read it, judge for yourself.
[01:49:08] Tell us what you think.
[01:49:10] I think if you read extreme ownership,
[01:49:14] when you read dichotomy, a lot of things are going to fall into place.
[01:49:18] A lot of little things that you didn't quite have at the way you wanted it to be.
[01:49:23] When you read dichotomy, it's going to come into place.
[01:49:25] Also, we got echelon front, which is our leadership consultancy.
[01:49:28] We solved problems through leadership.
[01:49:30] That's what we do.
[01:49:31] It's me, Dave Babin, JP, to now Dave Burke, Flynn, Cochran, Mike Surrely, Mike Bima.
[01:49:36] And our latest addition to the team, Master Chief Seal, retired Jason Gardner.
[01:49:43] And our new student, Asheline, from dot com, if you want us to come work with your company, the
[01:49:47] Master, we got three masters this year.
[01:49:52] All masters ever have sold out.
[01:49:56] These are going to sell out well, as well.
[01:49:59] There's May 23rd and 24th in Chicago, September 19th and 20th in Denver.
[01:50:05] December 4th and 5th in Sydney, Australia.
[01:50:10] We got a lot of extreme ownership dot com.
[01:50:13] If you want to come to these things, just go and register.
[01:50:16] I had friends, friends that said, hey, you know, I didn't really sign up.
[01:50:21] Can you just give me a couple tickets?
[01:50:23] And I'm like, actually, no, I can't.
[01:50:26] Because we can't fit any more people in the building.
[01:50:29] So no.
[01:50:31] So I can't help you if you wait too long.
[01:50:36] Register, get on it early.
[01:50:38] And if you want to come to this company, this is our interactive leadership training.
[01:50:44] If you want to get everyone in your company aligned, you want everyone in your company to
[01:50:50] understand the fundamental principles of extreme ownership.
[01:50:53] If you want them to understand the fundamental laws of combat that we used on the battlefield
[01:50:58] and that we have now taught two scores of businesses.
[01:51:03] If you want to have that training, you can go to EF online.
[01:51:07] It's interactive.
[01:51:10] It's you have to make decisions.
[01:51:12] It's choose your own adventure.
[01:51:15] It's tests.
[01:51:16] It's briefings.
[01:51:18] It's everything.
[01:51:19] And it's awesome.
[01:51:20] So check out EF online.com.
[01:51:24] Also, EF Overwatch where we are connecting proven leaders from the spec ops and combat aviation
[01:51:30] communities with companies in this building sector.
[01:51:34] Now here's the thing.
[01:51:37] You might think, well, I've got to hire somebody that's experienced in this industry.
[01:51:41] That's a good thought.
[01:51:42] I understand where you're coming from.
[01:51:44] What I recommend to you try is instead of hiring a person that has experienced in the industry
[01:51:50] have hired somebody that has experienced in something more important that is leadership.
[01:51:55] You can teach them and they can learn very quickly the industry that you're bringing them into.
[01:52:00] What you can't teach someone and when you can't give them is 20 years, 25 years, 22 years of leadership experience
[01:52:07] in the most high stakes business there is and that is war.
[01:52:15] So go to EF Overwatch.com.
[01:52:17] If you want to hire someone like that or if you are in that position of your vet and you want to look to get placed into a company.
[01:52:28] That's looking for leadership. EF Overwatch.com.
[01:52:32] And if you want to spend even more time with Echo Charles and myself because for some reason you think 500 hours of podcast isn't enough for you.
[01:52:43] We are out there. We are lurking on the inner webs on Twitter, on Instagram and on Facebook.
[01:52:50] Bookie.
[01:52:52] Moja. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and thanks to all the people in uniform for your service.
[01:53:01] That's our military personnel.
[01:53:03] Also our police and law enforcement correction officers, border patrols, all first responders and tonight especially the firefighters,
[01:53:13] which is Paramedics EMTs who face suffering and death on a daily basis and they learn how to handle it.
[01:53:22] They learn how to stay balanced. They learn how to detach but not too much.
[01:53:26] Thanks for all of you for providing us the freedom and security that we enjoy every day and to everyone else that's listening.
[01:53:37] You have ideas and dreams and you have vision and that's cool.
[01:53:46] That's awesome.
[01:53:47] But none of that means anything unless you execute.
[01:53:53] So execute, move forward, take action and you know what, maybe your idea works, maybe it doesn't.
[01:53:59] And if it doesn't and try another one and maybe none of them will ever work and that's fine because in the end
[01:54:06] at a minimum you know at least you went out there and got after it.
[01:54:15] So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
