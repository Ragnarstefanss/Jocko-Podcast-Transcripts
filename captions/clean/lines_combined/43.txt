00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.28 This is Jockel Podcast number 43 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:11.28 --> 00:00:17.24 All the lads have gone out to play at being soldiers far away.
00:00:17.24 --> 00:00:24.24 They won't be back for many a day and some won't be back any morning.
00:00:24.24 --> 00:00:30.92 All the lasses who laughing were when hearts were light and lads were here.
00:00:30.92 --> 00:00:34.96 They go sad-eyed wandering hither in there.
00:00:34.96 --> 00:00:39.76 They pray and watch for the morning.
00:00:39.76 --> 00:00:43.48 Every house has its vacant bed.
00:00:43.48 --> 00:00:50.36 Every night when sounds are dead, some woman yearns for the pillowed head of him who marched
00:00:50.36 --> 00:00:53.36 out in the morning.
00:00:53.36 --> 00:01:01.72 Of all the lads who've gone out to play, there's some or a turn and some who will stay.
00:01:01.72 --> 00:01:06.56 There's some will be back most any day.
00:01:06.56 --> 00:01:12.96 But some won't wake up in the morning.
00:01:12.96 --> 00:01:14.68 Good evening echo.
00:01:14.68 --> 00:01:16.68 Good evening.
00:01:16.68 --> 00:01:23.24 That poem right there is called the lads away and it's from a book called The
00:01:23.24 --> 00:01:26.96 Glory of the Trenches.
00:01:26.96 --> 00:01:29.56 That corneams be Dawson.
00:01:29.56 --> 00:01:39.000 And actually got this book in original copy of this book from a trooper from Jesse.
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.60 Trooper up from Canada and he sent me this book and like I said it's the actual first
00:01:42.60 --> 00:01:47.12 printing beautiful copy and it has that smell.
00:01:47.12 --> 00:01:54.12 The old book must be smell.
00:01:54.12 --> 00:01:57.36 It's one of those books where you can actually smell the age and you can smell the lessons
00:01:57.36 --> 00:02:03.08 learned and you can smell the wisdom inside of it.
00:02:03.08 --> 00:02:04.88 It's a different view.
00:02:04.88 --> 00:02:12.12 It's a different feel and I found it to be very fascinating.
00:02:12.12 --> 00:02:18.04 The intro to the book is actually written by Dawson's father.
00:02:18.04 --> 00:02:22.24 So the intro to the book, Dawson is the guy that wrote the book, Cunning's B. Dawson is
00:02:22.24 --> 00:02:23.24 the guy that wrote the book.
00:02:23.24 --> 00:02:28.96 Well his dad wrote the intro to the book and he kind of kicks it off and here's some
00:02:28.96 --> 00:02:30.12 of the highlights of that.
00:02:30.12 --> 00:02:36.44 He says I've already stated the conditions under which this book of my sons was produced.
00:02:36.44 --> 00:02:42.96 He was wounded in the end of June 1917 in the fierce struggle before lens.
00:02:42.96 --> 00:02:48.60 He was at once removed to a base hospital later to a military hospital in London there
00:02:48.60 --> 00:02:54.80 was engraved danger of amputation of the right arm, but this was happily avoided.
00:02:54.80 --> 00:02:58.12 As soon as he could use his hand he was commingdeared by the Lord High Commissioner of
00:02:58.12 --> 00:03:03.64 Canada right and important paper detailing the history of the Canadian forces in France
00:03:03.64 --> 00:03:06.84 and flanders.
00:03:06.84 --> 00:03:11.64 He goes on to talk about how they came up with the name of the book and they go through
00:03:11.64 --> 00:03:17.32 a couple different titles and they settle on this title, the glory of the trenches.
00:03:17.32 --> 00:03:23.92 Lastly we decided on the glory of the trenches as the most expressive of his aim.
00:03:23.92 --> 00:03:30.04 He felt that a great deal too much had been said about the squalder, filth, discomfort and
00:03:30.04 --> 00:03:31.72 suffering of the trenches.
00:03:31.72 --> 00:03:34.64 Now clearly that stuff that I've talked about.
00:03:34.64 --> 00:03:36.000 And so this should have tell you that's what I'm talking about.
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000 This is a different take on World War I.
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.60 Because he's saying look we've heard enough about the squalder that felt this comfort
00:03:42.60 --> 00:03:45.80 I'm going to talk about the glory of the trenches.
00:03:45.80 --> 00:03:51.88 He pointed out that a very popular war book which we were reading had six paragraphs and
00:03:51.88 --> 00:03:57.44 the first 60 pages which described an unpleasant detail, the verminous condition of the men.
00:03:57.44 --> 00:04:02.92 Because if this were the chief thing to be remarked concerning them, he held that it was
00:04:02.92 --> 00:04:09.40 a mistake for a writer to lay too much on the too much stress on the horrors of war.
00:04:09.40 --> 00:04:12.76 The effect was bad physiologically.
00:04:12.76 --> 00:04:15.08 It frightened the parents of soldiers.
00:04:15.08 --> 00:04:20.72 It was equally bad for the enlisted man himself for it created a false impression in his mind.
00:04:20.72 --> 00:04:25.68 We all knew that war was horrible, but as a rule the soldier thought little of his
00:04:25.68 --> 00:04:29.36 future in this lot.
00:04:29.36 --> 00:04:33.24 The real soldier thoughts were concerned with other things.
00:04:33.24 --> 00:04:37.28 He was engaged in spiritual acts and this is what I'm talking about.
00:04:37.28 --> 00:04:40.20 This is a different cut.
00:04:40.20 --> 00:04:47.44 He was accomplishing spiritual purposes as truly as the marker of faith and religion.
00:04:47.44 --> 00:04:54.32 He was moved by spiritual impulses, the evocation of duty, the loyal dependence of
00:04:54.32 --> 00:05:01.24 the comradeship, the spirit of sacrifice, the complete surrender of the body to the will of
00:05:01.24 --> 00:05:03.32 the soul.
00:05:03.32 --> 00:05:06.76 This was the side of war which men needed most to recognize.
00:05:06.76 --> 00:05:11.76 They needed it not only because it was the true side, but because nothing else could
00:05:11.76 --> 00:05:16.72 Kindle and sustain the enduring flame of heroism in men's hearts.
00:05:16.72 --> 00:05:20.88 So he's looking at this, you know, it's called the glory of the trenches.
00:05:20.88 --> 00:05:26.56 This, what happens in the trenches is like a religion, it's like a spiritual thing.
00:05:26.56 --> 00:05:30.84 Which another thing that drew me to this is because, you know, I talk all the time about
00:05:30.84 --> 00:05:33.72 how there's the most beautiful things in war.
00:05:33.72 --> 00:05:36.84 I mean, there's the most horrible things, but there's also these beautiful things.
00:05:36.84 --> 00:05:42.48 And so I can see he's very focused on what those things are.
00:05:42.48 --> 00:05:49.04 While some aired in exhibiting nothing but the brutality of war, others aired by sentimentizing
00:05:49.04 --> 00:05:50.52 war.
00:05:50.52 --> 00:05:55.52 He admitted that it was perfectly possible to paint a portrait of a soldier with an aura
00:05:55.52 --> 00:06:00.60 of a saint, but it would not be a representative portrait.
00:06:00.60 --> 00:06:06.36 It would be eclectic, the result of the selection and the elimination.
00:06:06.36 --> 00:06:11.24 So he's saying like on the one hand, you get these books that paint this crazy brutal side
00:06:11.24 --> 00:06:15.32 of war, the other side you get them painting soldiers as saints.
00:06:15.32 --> 00:06:18.000 And neither want to show which I will totally agree with.
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.08 You know, we do have a definite tendency to do that in literature or people that write
00:06:23.08 --> 00:06:26.52 about war, they want to write about, you know, they make everyone look like the best guy ever.
00:06:26.52 --> 00:06:28.16 None of us are.
00:06:28.16 --> 00:06:30.24 None of us are.
00:06:30.24 --> 00:06:33.16 We all have faults.
00:06:33.16 --> 00:06:38.76 Back to the book, the ordinary soldier is an intensely human creature with an endearing
00:06:38.76 --> 00:06:41.52 blend of faults and virtues.
00:06:41.52 --> 00:06:47.60 The romantic method of portraying him not only misrepresented him, but its result is far
00:06:47.60 --> 00:06:54.72 less impressive than a portrait painted in the firm lines of reality.
00:06:54.72 --> 00:06:59.72 So they do all this to make the guy look like a saint, but what's real is actually more
00:06:59.72 --> 00:07:00.96 amazing.
00:07:00.96 --> 00:07:07.16 There's an austere grandeur in the reality of what he is and does which needs no fine
00:07:07.16 --> 00:07:10.60 gilding from the sentimentalist.
00:07:10.60 --> 00:07:17.24 To depict him as Sir Gala had in Holy Armor is a serious offense as to exhibit him
00:07:17.24 --> 00:07:24.76 as a caliban, which is from Shakespeare, from the temp to see like the ultimate bad guy
00:07:24.76 --> 00:07:31.32 in the Shakespeare's play the temp, the tempest, because the total beast.
00:07:31.32 --> 00:07:37.52 So you can't portray the person as Gala had, you can't, you can't, you know, again portraying
00:07:37.52 --> 00:07:40.04 him as a saint.
00:07:40.04 --> 00:07:45.48 Each method fails of truth and all that the soldier needs to be known about him that men
00:07:45.48 --> 00:07:49.96 should honor him is the truth.
00:07:49.96 --> 00:07:58.84 War, a hot new air, which men breathed, produced new energies and forms of thought.
00:07:58.84 --> 00:08:03.64 Men were rediscovering themselves, their own forgotten abilities, the latent abilities
00:08:03.64 --> 00:08:06.60 in all men.
00:08:06.60 --> 00:08:12.40 Bound together in the daily obedience of self-surrender, urged by conditions of their
00:08:12.40 --> 00:08:21.20 task to regard duty as inexorable, confronted by the pitilist destruction of the body.
00:08:21.20 --> 00:08:26.88 They were forced into recognition of the spiritual values of life.
00:08:26.88 --> 00:08:30.44 So faced with what they were facing in World War I and we've talked about that over and
00:08:30.44 --> 00:08:34.08 over again, you're facing death.
00:08:34.08 --> 00:08:41.92 And these guys, these soldiers are forced to look at their spiritual self.
00:08:41.92 --> 00:08:47.40 The common conventional use of the term, these men were not religious.
00:08:47.40 --> 00:08:52.04 There was much in their speech and in their conduct, which would outrage the standards
00:08:52.04 --> 00:08:54.24 of narrow piousism.
00:08:54.24 --> 00:08:57.48 So hey, these guys are not good at issues.
00:08:57.48 --> 00:09:02.84 Traditional creeds and forms of faith had scant authority for them, but they had made their
00:09:02.84 --> 00:09:08.08 own a sure faith then lives in creeds.
00:09:08.08 --> 00:09:19.20 So what they discover on the battlefield is even stronger than what the churches say.
00:09:19.20 --> 00:09:24.56 It was expressed not in words, but acts.
00:09:24.56 --> 00:09:35.36 They had freed their souls from the tyrannies of time and the fear of death.
00:09:35.36 --> 00:09:46.92 They had accomplished indeed that very emancipation of the soul, which is the essential doctrine
00:09:46.92 --> 00:09:54.88 of all religions, which all religions urge on men, but which few men really achieve.
00:09:54.88 --> 00:10:01.24 However, earnestly they profess forms of pious faith.
00:10:01.24 --> 00:10:02.24 That's pretty amazing.
00:10:02.24 --> 00:10:05.20 That's pretty amazing viewpoint.
00:10:05.20 --> 00:10:13.36 What you find out on the battlefield is spiritually stronger than what you find in the
00:10:13.36 --> 00:10:18.32 church.
00:10:18.32 --> 00:10:24.16 Back to the book, this was the true glory of the trenches.
00:10:24.16 --> 00:10:30.18 They were the cavalaries of a new redemption being wrought out from men by soiled unconscious
00:10:30.18 --> 00:10:31.18 Christ.
00:10:31.18 --> 00:10:32.70 That's what the soldiers were.
00:10:32.70 --> 00:10:36.50 Soiled, dirty, unconscious means they don't even know it.
00:10:36.50 --> 00:10:39.62 Christ's.
00:10:39.62 --> 00:10:46.14 And as from that ancient cavalry with its agony of shame, torture and dereliction, their
00:10:46.14 --> 00:10:52.34 flowed a flood of light, which made a new dawn for the world.
00:10:52.34 --> 00:10:59.86 So from these obscure crucifixions, there would come to men a new revelation of the splendor
00:10:59.86 --> 00:11:02.66 of the human soul.
00:11:02.66 --> 00:11:10.62 The true divinity that dwells in man, the God made manifest in the flesh by acts of valor,
00:11:10.62 --> 00:11:19.94 heroism, and self-sacrifice, which transcend the instincts and promptings of the flesh.
00:11:19.94 --> 00:11:30.10 Bear witness to the indestructible life of the Spirit.
00:11:30.10 --> 00:11:31.10 That's heavy.
00:11:31.10 --> 00:11:41.82 That's just, like I said, this viewpoint is I totally understand where it's coming from.
00:11:41.82 --> 00:11:46.38 And it expresses a lot of the things that I think I haven't thought about it to this degree,
00:11:46.38 --> 00:11:47.38 though.
00:11:47.38 --> 00:11:55.54 So calling the death of soldiers on the battlefield, true to fictions.
00:11:55.54 --> 00:12:01.26 And that God is made manifest in the flesh that these guys when they make these sacrifices,
00:12:01.26 --> 00:12:04.42 it's like a glimpse of God.
00:12:04.42 --> 00:12:09.82 These acts of valor and heroism, and it's just very powerful.
00:12:09.82 --> 00:12:14.78 Now that's wrapped up, you know, the intro's longer than that, obviously.
00:12:14.78 --> 00:12:18.46 But now we're going to go to the book itself, which again is written by this soldier,
00:12:18.46 --> 00:12:19.46 Dawson.
00:12:19.46 --> 00:12:21.66 And it actually starts with his training.
00:12:21.66 --> 00:12:28.62 And he was from England, and he lived in Canada.
00:12:28.62 --> 00:12:35.38 He ends up joining the military, because you know, Canada was supporting and helping Britain
00:12:35.38 --> 00:12:36.94 and the war.
00:12:36.94 --> 00:12:38.10 And he actually traveled to New York.
00:12:38.10 --> 00:12:40.02 He lived all over the place.
00:12:40.02 --> 00:12:45.02 And now he's going to boot camp.
00:12:45.02 --> 00:12:49.26 When I had been medically examined, past his fit had dawned a uniform and commenced
00:12:49.26 --> 00:12:55.42 to my training, I learned what the enduring of hardship was.
00:12:55.42 --> 00:13:01.30 No experience on active service has equal the humiliation and severity of those first months
00:13:01.30 --> 00:13:02.86 of soldiering.
00:13:02.86 --> 00:13:08.58 We were sneered at clean, stables, groomed horses, road stripped saddles, stripped saddle
00:13:08.58 --> 00:13:13.70 for 12 miles at the trot, attended lectures, studied till past midnight, and were up
00:13:13.70 --> 00:13:17.02 on the first parade at 6 o'clock.
00:13:17.02 --> 00:13:22.58 No previous civilian efficiency or prominent stood us in any stead.
00:13:22.58 --> 00:13:25.22 We started robbed of all importance.
00:13:25.22 --> 00:13:26.78 I love that.
00:13:26.78 --> 00:13:27.78 We started robbed of all three.
00:13:27.78 --> 00:13:29.50 So you know that thing, you have that to do?
00:13:29.50 --> 00:13:30.50 Yeah, it's gone.
00:13:30.50 --> 00:13:32.46 Just get rid of that.
00:13:32.46 --> 00:13:37.38 And only gained a new importance by our power to hang on and develop a new efficiency as
00:13:37.38 --> 00:13:39.10 soldiers.
00:13:39.10 --> 00:13:42.46 You've heard me say that before, like when I joined the military, that's one of my favorite
00:13:42.46 --> 00:13:43.46 things about us.
00:13:43.46 --> 00:13:44.46 I was like a blank slate.
00:13:44.46 --> 00:13:48.46 Like everything you did in your past, all the stuff you've been through, little trouble
00:13:48.46 --> 00:13:50.30 things you've done, it's all gone.
00:13:50.30 --> 00:13:55.38 What matters now is what you do here.
00:13:55.38 --> 00:14:02.26 When men went sick, they were labeled scrim shankers and struck off the course.
00:14:02.26 --> 00:14:03.70 It was an offense.
00:14:03.70 --> 00:14:09.38 It was an offense to let your body interfere with your duty.
00:14:09.38 --> 00:14:12.26 If it tried to, you must ignore it.
00:14:12.26 --> 00:14:17.50 If a man caught cold in Kingston, what would he not catch in the trenches?
00:14:17.50 --> 00:14:21.46 Very many went down under physical, under the physical ordeal.
00:14:21.46 --> 00:14:24.82 Of the class that started, I don't think more than the third past.
00:14:24.82 --> 00:14:31.18 The lukewarm soldier and the pink tea hero who simply wanted to swank a uniform were eventually
00:14:31.18 --> 00:14:33.34 choked off.
00:14:33.34 --> 00:14:38.06 Who's a test of pluck, even more than of strength or intelligence.
00:14:38.06 --> 00:14:44.14 The same test that a man would be subjected to all the time at the front.
00:14:44.14 --> 00:14:50.30 In a word, it started out the fellows who had guts.
00:14:50.30 --> 00:14:54.78 guts isn't a particularly polite word, but I have come increasingly to appreciate
00:14:54.78 --> 00:14:57.86 its splendid significance.
00:14:57.86 --> 00:15:04.62 The possessor of this much coveted quality is the kind of idiot who, when his legs are
00:15:04.62 --> 00:15:09.82 smitten, will fight upon his stumps.
00:15:09.82 --> 00:15:14.82 And actually, when I read this, I was like, man, there's some archaic term of idiot
00:15:14.82 --> 00:15:17.18 why is he using that word and there was none.
00:15:17.18 --> 00:15:22.18 He means, that's what he means is a guy, and we say this in the sea of training, like
00:15:22.18 --> 00:15:24.22 if you're going to be stupid, you've got to be tough.
00:15:24.22 --> 00:15:29.58 And that's kind of what he's saying, like these guys will go and they will not stop.
00:15:29.58 --> 00:15:32.46 And that's what guts is.
00:15:32.46 --> 00:15:36.14 The Tommy's in that displaying word for the British soldiers, whom we were going to
00:15:36.14 --> 00:15:40.10 command, would be like that.
00:15:40.10 --> 00:15:43.58 If we weren't like it, we wouldn't be any good as officers.
00:15:43.58 --> 00:15:49.98 This artillery school had a violent way of sifting out a man's moral worth.
00:15:49.98 --> 00:15:54.06 You hadn't much concede left by the end of it.
00:15:54.06 --> 00:16:00.22 So I can only imagine, we have a very politically correct military system now and it's
00:16:00.22 --> 00:16:04.58 getting, I can't imagine what these soldiers went through.
00:16:04.58 --> 00:16:09.82 I mean, just unleashing these veterans on them coming out and trying to get them ready
00:16:09.82 --> 00:16:11.62 for war, I bet it was brutal.
00:16:11.62 --> 00:16:12.90 And it sounds like it was brutal.
00:16:12.90 --> 00:16:17.30 And it sounds like it did a very effective job of getting rid of the weak, of making your
00:16:17.30 --> 00:16:25.46 ego completely go away, getting rid of any form of concede that you had.
00:16:25.46 --> 00:16:30.66 Now he continues on the book, but I'm going to move a little bit forward here to where
00:16:30.66 --> 00:16:32.26 he's moving towards the front.
00:16:32.26 --> 00:16:33.90 And we'll go back to the book.
00:16:33.90 --> 00:16:38.18 After trudging about six miles, we arrived at the camp and found that it was out of
00:16:38.18 --> 00:16:42.46 food and that all the tents were occupied.
00:16:42.46 --> 00:16:46.62 We stretched out our sleeping bags on the ground and went to bed's supper list.
00:16:46.62 --> 00:16:48.78 We had no food all day.
00:16:48.78 --> 00:16:53.38 Next morning we were told that we ought to jump on an ammunition lorry if we wanted to go
00:16:53.38 --> 00:16:55.14 any further on our journey.
00:16:55.14 --> 00:16:58.94 Nobody seemed to want us particularly and no one could give us the least information
00:16:58.94 --> 00:17:00.78 as to where our division was.
00:17:00.78 --> 00:17:06.62 It was another lesson if that were needed of our total unimportance.
00:17:06.62 --> 00:17:09.10 So these guys are looking to find whether or not we're supposed to report to say, go
00:17:09.10 --> 00:17:10.10 fight in the war.
00:17:10.10 --> 00:17:13.02 And people are like, I don't know, no time for you.
00:17:13.02 --> 00:17:15.06 Go figure it out.
00:17:15.06 --> 00:17:19.78 While we were raiding on the roadside in Australian brigade of artillery passed by,
00:17:19.78 --> 00:17:22.58 the men's faces were dreary with fatigue.
00:17:22.58 --> 00:17:27.06 The gunners were dismounted and marched as in a trance.
00:17:27.06 --> 00:17:29.94 The harness was muddy.
00:17:29.94 --> 00:17:34.38 The steel rusty, the horses lean and discouraged.
00:17:34.38 --> 00:17:37.50 We understood that they were pulling out from an offensive in which they had received
00:17:37.50 --> 00:17:39.70 a bad cutting up.
00:17:39.70 --> 00:17:44.46 To my overstrain imagination it seemed that the men had the vision of death in their
00:17:44.46 --> 00:17:46.86 eyes.
00:17:46.86 --> 00:17:52.14 Towards the evening, the thunder of the guns had swelled into an ominous roar.
00:17:52.14 --> 00:17:55.98 We passed through villages disfigured by shell fire.
00:17:55.98 --> 00:17:59.70 Civilians became more rare and more aged.
00:17:59.70 --> 00:18:02.50 Cattle disappeared utterly from the landscape.
00:18:02.50 --> 00:18:08.62 Fields were furrowed with abandoned trances in front of which hung in tanglements of wire.
00:18:08.62 --> 00:18:12.82 Mounted orderly splashed along selling roads at an impatient trot.
00:18:12.82 --> 00:18:17.30 Here and there we came across improvised beer vacts of infantry.
00:18:17.30 --> 00:18:22.86 Far away against the horizon towards which we traveled, hunt flares and rockets were going
00:18:22.86 --> 00:18:23.86 up.
00:18:23.86 --> 00:18:28.10 Hopeless stoicism, unordered of a desolation.
00:18:28.10 --> 00:18:32.66 That was my first impression.
00:18:32.66 --> 00:18:35.66 The landscape was getting increasingly muddy.
00:18:35.66 --> 00:18:37.94 It became a sea of mud.
00:18:37.94 --> 00:18:42.58 Dispatch riders on motorbikes traveled whereally their feet dragging to save themselves from
00:18:42.58 --> 00:18:43.58 falling.
00:18:43.58 --> 00:18:45.94 Everything was splashed with filth and corruption.
00:18:45.94 --> 00:18:50.62 One marveled at the cleanliness of the sky.
00:18:50.62 --> 00:18:56.26 Trees were blasted and seemed to be sinking out of sight in this war created slew of
00:18:56.26 --> 00:18:58.14 despondency.
00:18:58.14 --> 00:19:02.54 We came to a brow of a hill in the valley with something that I recognized.
00:19:02.54 --> 00:19:07.42 The last time I had seen it was an etching in a shop window in Newark, New Jersey.
00:19:07.42 --> 00:19:13.22 It was a town from the midst of who's battered ruins a splintered tower to sort against
00:19:13.22 --> 00:19:15.10 the sky.
00:19:15.10 --> 00:19:21.66 Leaning far out from the tower so that it seemed she must drop was a statue of the virgin
00:19:21.66 --> 00:19:24.34 with the Christ in her arms.
00:19:24.34 --> 00:19:29.94 It was a superstition with the French and I remembered that so long as she did not fall,
00:19:29.94 --> 00:19:32.94 things would go well with the allies.
00:19:32.94 --> 00:19:40.38 As we watched a shell screamed over the gaping roofs and a call of smoke going up.
00:19:40.38 --> 00:19:44.46 As we entered the streets, Tommy's more polluted than miners crept out from the skeletons
00:19:44.46 --> 00:19:45.70 of houses.
00:19:45.70 --> 00:19:50.70 They lent listlessly against sagging doorways to watch us pass.
00:19:50.70 --> 00:19:55.94 If we asked for information as to where our division was, they shook their heads stupidly
00:19:55.94 --> 00:20:00.22 to indifferent with weariness to reply.
00:20:00.22 --> 00:20:09.62 For the next three nights we slept by our wits and got our food by foraging.
00:20:09.62 --> 00:20:15.98 So we know, I mean we know this is a world war one, we know it's an absolute nightmare.
00:20:15.98 --> 00:20:17.98 It's an absolute nightmare.
00:20:17.98 --> 00:20:21.98 And you know what was surprising me, you know this guy's an officer and he has no idea
00:20:21.98 --> 00:20:22.98 what he's doing.
00:20:22.98 --> 00:20:28.50 He's just walking around and people are so dispondent from the war that they just
00:20:28.50 --> 00:20:34.58 don't even care.
00:20:34.58 --> 00:20:38.42 Back to the book, there was a headquarters nearby who's battalion was in the line.
00:20:38.42 --> 00:20:43.66 I struck up liaison with its officers and at times went into the crowded tent, which was
00:20:43.66 --> 00:20:45.26 their mess to get warm.
00:20:45.26 --> 00:20:50.50 Runners would come there at all hours of day and night bringing messages from the front.
00:20:50.50 --> 00:20:56.54 They were usually well spent, sometimes they gasped, but they had, but they all had the
00:20:56.54 --> 00:21:00.22 invincible determination to carry on.
00:21:00.22 --> 00:21:04.22 After they delivered their message, they would lie down in the mud and go to sleep like
00:21:04.22 --> 00:21:05.86 dogs.
00:21:05.86 --> 00:21:10.02 The moment the reply was ready, they would lurch to their feet throwing off their weiriness
00:21:10.02 --> 00:21:16.14 as if it were a thing to be conquered and despised.
00:21:16.14 --> 00:21:18.42 Go ahead and read that one again.
00:21:18.42 --> 00:21:22.54 So these guys are dog tired, they'd lay down in the mud, someone is preparing a reply
00:21:22.54 --> 00:21:27.62 for these messages and then the moment the reply was ready, they would lurch to their
00:21:27.62 --> 00:21:34.22 feet throwing off their weiriness as though it were a thing to be conquered and despised.
00:21:34.22 --> 00:21:41.06 I appreciate now as never before, I appreciate it now as never before the lesson of guts
00:21:41.06 --> 00:21:46.78 that I have been taught at Kingston.
00:21:46.78 --> 00:21:52.18 The other side of the town, the ravages of the war were far more marked.
00:21:52.18 --> 00:21:57.02 All the way along the roadside were clumps of little crosses, French, English, German,
00:21:57.02 --> 00:22:01.50 planted above their hurried graves of brave fellows who had fallen.
00:22:01.50 --> 00:22:09.82 Ambulances were picking their way weirly, turning with the last night's toll of wounded.
00:22:09.82 --> 00:22:16.06 We saw newly dead men and horses pulled to one sign who had been caught in the darkness
00:22:16.06 --> 00:22:22.62 by the enemies harassing fire, in places, in places the country had holes the size of
00:22:22.62 --> 00:22:29.46 quarries, where mines had exploded and shells from large caliber guns had detonated.
00:22:29.46 --> 00:22:35.26 Bedlam was raging up front, shells went screaming over us, seeking out victims in the
00:22:35.26 --> 00:22:37.38 back country.
00:22:37.38 --> 00:22:41.66 To have been there by oneself would have been most disturbing but the men about me seemed
00:22:41.66 --> 00:22:46.14 to regard it as perfectly ordinary and normal.
00:22:46.14 --> 00:22:54.46 I steadied myself by their example.
00:22:54.46 --> 00:22:58.94 It's interesting because we're talking about this and it sounds like hell and they're
00:22:58.94 --> 00:23:00.10 not even in the front yet.
00:23:00.10 --> 00:23:01.26 They're not on the front lines.
00:23:01.26 --> 00:23:08.18 This is behind.
00:23:08.18 --> 00:23:10.10 That's something else we were talking about today.
00:23:10.10 --> 00:23:14.86 You can see these guys, whatever pain and suffering they're feeling, they're not showing
00:23:14.86 --> 00:23:15.86 it.
00:23:15.86 --> 00:23:18.94 And he knows he can't show it.
00:23:18.94 --> 00:23:25.22 And that kind of bolsters them all and makes them all stronger.
00:23:25.22 --> 00:23:32.98 Back to the book about seven o'clock as we were resting the evening hate commenced.
00:23:32.98 --> 00:23:40.02 In those days the evening hate was a regular habit with the hunt.
00:23:40.02 --> 00:23:44.02 The new our country better than we did for he had retired from it.
00:23:44.02 --> 00:23:50.26 Every evening he used to search out all communication trenches and likely battery positions
00:23:50.26 --> 00:23:53.46 with any quantity of shells.
00:23:53.46 --> 00:23:57.74 So seven o'clock at night the Germans would just they knew all the positions because they
00:23:57.74 --> 00:24:03.78 had surrendered them so then they would just start dropping bombs, dropping artillery on
00:24:03.78 --> 00:24:08.74 the known positions that they knew they knew of the trenches where they built them.
00:24:08.74 --> 00:24:13.98 His idea was to rob us of our morale.
00:24:13.98 --> 00:24:19.42 I wish he might have seen how abysmal he failed to do it.
00:24:19.42 --> 00:24:24.50 Down our narrow valley like a flight of arrows the shells screamed in whistles.
00:24:24.50 --> 00:24:29.62 Where they struck the ground look like resurrection day with the dead elbowing their way
00:24:29.62 --> 00:24:36.02 into daylight and forcing back the earth from their eyes.
00:24:36.02 --> 00:24:42.34 There were actually many dead men just beneath the surface and as the ground was plowed up
00:24:42.34 --> 00:24:50.38 the smell of corruption became distinctly unpleasant.
00:24:50.38 --> 00:24:55.74 So these guys are buried they're buried in whatever four or five feet of dirt and these
00:24:55.74 --> 00:25:01.78 shells come in and dig them up.
00:25:01.78 --> 00:25:05.50 Only the shells began to go dud.
00:25:05.50 --> 00:25:08.78 So imagine this you're hearing these big explosion and then some shells hit and there's
00:25:08.78 --> 00:25:10.42 no explosion.
00:25:10.42 --> 00:25:11.94 You know what that means?
00:25:11.94 --> 00:25:15.22 It means it's gas.
00:25:15.22 --> 00:25:21.02 We realized that these were gas shells a thin, blueish vapor spread throughout the valley
00:25:21.02 --> 00:25:23.70 and breathing became oppressive.
00:25:23.70 --> 00:25:28.66 Then like stallions kicking in the stalls the heavy guns on the ridge above us opened
00:25:28.66 --> 00:25:29.66 up.
00:25:29.66 --> 00:25:31.82 Now the friendly guns start to open up.
00:25:31.82 --> 00:25:34.74 It was fine to hear them stamping their defiance.
00:25:34.74 --> 00:25:39.50 They made one want to get grips with his aggressors and the brief silence is one could
00:25:39.50 --> 00:25:40.94 hear our chaps laughing.
00:25:40.94 --> 00:25:45.10 So I want you to imagine this is awesome.
00:25:45.10 --> 00:25:48.78 You're getting chilled, you're getting crushed.
00:25:48.78 --> 00:25:52.06 There's dead bodies coming up from the soil.
00:25:52.06 --> 00:25:55.42 There's gas in the air.
00:25:55.42 --> 00:26:02.46 And here we go, in the brief silences, one could hear our chaps laughing.
00:26:02.46 --> 00:26:05.38 The danger seemed to fill them with a wild excitement.
00:26:05.38 --> 00:26:11.34 Every time a shell came near them and missed, they would taunt the unseen huns for
00:26:11.34 --> 00:26:18.86 their purport gunnery, giving what they considered necessary corrections.
00:26:18.86 --> 00:26:21.54 Five minutes more left old cock.
00:26:21.54 --> 00:26:24.10 If you'd only drop 50, you'd get us.
00:26:24.10 --> 00:26:28.02 There he's giving corrections to the guns.
00:26:28.02 --> 00:26:35.42 These men didn't know what fear was or if they did, they kept it to themselves.
00:26:35.42 --> 00:26:39.22 And these were the chaps whom I was to order.
00:26:39.22 --> 00:26:41.98 So we haven't heard too much about that.
00:26:41.98 --> 00:26:44.50 And Tony and Dave talked about it.
00:26:44.50 --> 00:26:50.54 Being a shot at and being really close calls situations and like everyone's laughing
00:26:50.54 --> 00:26:52.62 and it does happen.
00:26:52.62 --> 00:26:57.86 Hold war one, don't hear much about it, but here you go.
00:26:57.86 --> 00:26:58.86 Unbelievable.
00:26:58.86 --> 00:27:02.98 That's part of the way that military, that you do, not just military, but any bad situation.
00:27:02.98 --> 00:27:06.02 You know, a little humor goes a long way.
00:27:06.02 --> 00:27:10.94 A little humor goes a long way.
00:27:10.94 --> 00:27:11.94 Back to the book.
00:27:11.94 --> 00:27:12.94 We entered a trench.
00:27:12.94 --> 00:27:16.82 And this is, by the way, this is, I'm obviously not reading the entire book.
00:27:16.82 --> 00:27:22.14 I'm going to some highlights, so there's a little bit of a skip, you know, time here
00:27:22.14 --> 00:27:25.50 as they move towards the front.
00:27:25.50 --> 00:27:26.50 Back to the book.
00:27:26.50 --> 00:27:28.34 We entered a trench.
00:27:28.34 --> 00:27:33.78 Holds were scooped out in the side of it, just large enough to shelter a man crouching.
00:27:33.78 --> 00:27:40.58 Each hole contained a sleeping soldier who looked as dead as the occupant of a catacom.
00:27:40.58 --> 00:27:45.98 Some of the holes had been blown in, all you saw of the late occupant was a protruding
00:27:45.98 --> 00:27:48.66 arm or leg.
00:27:48.66 --> 00:27:53.50 That best there was a horrid similarity between the dead and the living.
00:27:53.50 --> 00:27:57.90 It seemed that the walls of the trenches had been built out of corpses.
00:27:57.90 --> 00:28:06.42 For one, recognize the uniforms of French and the Huns.
00:28:06.42 --> 00:28:10.62 So you're in this trench, but you're protected somewhat, but you got to dig another hole
00:28:10.62 --> 00:28:13.66 into the wall of the trench.
00:28:13.66 --> 00:28:18.74 And some of those guys get buried and killed and the body's are just there.
00:28:18.74 --> 00:28:21.94 Really, I mean, talk about hell.
00:28:21.94 --> 00:28:22.74 Hell.
00:28:22.74 --> 00:28:27.22 Back to the book.
00:28:27.22 --> 00:28:33.62 The enemy's shelling was growing more intense as was always the way on the zone, so we're
00:28:33.62 --> 00:28:35.90 there at the zone, the battle was on.
00:28:35.90 --> 00:28:39.18 When we were bringing in our, when we were bringing out our wounded.
00:28:39.18 --> 00:28:43.50 The good many of our trenches were directly on filet and if you don't know what that is,
00:28:43.50 --> 00:28:49.90 on filet is like, if you can imagine a line of people and you are shooting down the line
00:28:49.90 --> 00:28:55.26 of people and how much more exposed you are in that situation.
00:28:55.26 --> 00:29:00.78 So picture if I told you to shoot some of these 10 cans and I lined them up in a straight line,
00:29:00.78 --> 00:29:04.22 perpendicular to you, you'd have to aim at each individual one and you might hit it,
00:29:04.22 --> 00:29:05.22 you might not.
00:29:05.22 --> 00:29:09.26 If we put them all in a big line where they're, where they're parallel to you or they're,
00:29:09.26 --> 00:29:13.86 they go down the same gun target line that you have, you can, if you hit one, you might
00:29:13.86 --> 00:29:16.90 hit two, you might hit three, you might hit all of them with one shot.
00:29:16.90 --> 00:29:19.70 And so this is a bad situation to be in.
00:29:19.70 --> 00:29:23.46 You never want to have the enemy, so they're basically on your flank and you're lined
00:29:23.46 --> 00:29:24.86 up for them to shoot at you.
00:29:24.86 --> 00:29:27.38 It's a nightmare.
00:29:27.38 --> 00:29:29.30 Shell's burst just behind the parapet.
00:29:29.30 --> 00:29:30.82 When they didn't burst on it.
00:29:30.82 --> 00:29:38.98 It was about this point in my breaking in that I received a blow to the head and thank God
00:29:38.98 --> 00:29:43.46 for the man who invented the steel helmet so he's getting hit with some shrapnel.
00:29:43.46 --> 00:29:47.78 Night came down and we found that our carriage had no lights.
00:29:47.78 --> 00:29:52.26 It must have been nearing dawn when I was away and again I skipped a little bit but here
00:29:52.26 --> 00:29:55.22 we are obviously using a carriage.
00:29:55.22 --> 00:30:00.50 It must have been nearing dawn when I was awakened by the distant thunder of guns.
00:30:00.50 --> 00:30:07.94 I crouched in my corner, cold and cramped, trying to visualize the terror of it.
00:30:07.94 --> 00:30:12.50 I asked myself whether I was afraid.
00:30:12.50 --> 00:30:17.62 Not of death I told myself but of being afraid.
00:30:17.62 --> 00:30:19.70 Yes, most horribly.
00:30:19.70 --> 00:30:21.54 He was most horribly afraid.
00:30:21.54 --> 00:30:23.22 Not of death they're being wounded.
00:30:23.22 --> 00:30:24.82 He was afraid of being afraid.
00:30:24.82 --> 00:30:25.82 Yeah.
00:30:25.82 --> 00:30:37.50 This first experience in no man's land did away with my last Flabby fear.
00:30:37.50 --> 00:30:40.62 If I was afraid I would show it.
00:30:40.62 --> 00:30:45.74 One is often afraid and he soldier who asserts the contrary may not be a liar but he certainly
00:30:45.74 --> 00:30:49.02 does not speak the truth.
00:30:49.02 --> 00:30:52.90 Physical fear is too deeply rooted to be overcome by any amount of training.
00:30:52.90 --> 00:31:04.74 It remains then to train a man in spiritual pride so that when he fears nobody knows it.
00:31:04.74 --> 00:31:06.82 Cowardous is contagious.
00:31:06.82 --> 00:31:14.22 It has been said that no battalion is braver than its least brave member.
00:31:14.22 --> 00:31:21.86 Military courage therefore is a form of unselfishness.
00:31:21.86 --> 00:31:30.18 It is practiced that it may save the weaker men's lives and uphold their honor.
00:31:30.18 --> 00:31:38.58 The worst thing you can say of a man out on the front is that he doesn't play the game.
00:31:38.58 --> 00:31:39.82 That doesn't have necessity.
00:31:39.82 --> 00:31:41.46 He fails to do his duty.
00:31:41.46 --> 00:31:42.70 Listen to this.
00:31:42.70 --> 00:31:45.02 That doesn't mean he fails to do his duty.
00:31:45.02 --> 00:31:51.74 What it means is that he fails to do a bit more than his duty.
00:31:51.74 --> 00:31:58.22 In a man plays the game he does things which it requires a braver man than himself to
00:31:58.22 --> 00:32:00.26 accomplish.
00:32:00.26 --> 00:32:01.70 He never knows when he's done.
00:32:01.70 --> 00:32:05.82 He acknowledges no limit to his cheerfulness and strength.
00:32:05.82 --> 00:32:14.26 Whatever his rank holds his life less valuable than that of the humblest.
00:32:14.26 --> 00:32:20.14 He laughs at danger not because he does not dread it but because he has learnt that there
00:32:20.14 --> 00:32:33.10 are ailments more terrible and less curable than death.
00:32:33.10 --> 00:32:45.42 ailments more terrible and less curable than death and that ailment is cowardice.
00:32:45.42 --> 00:32:51.58 Until I became a part of the war I was a doubter of the nobility and others and a skeptic
00:32:51.58 --> 00:32:54.82 as regards to myself.
00:32:54.82 --> 00:33:00.26 The growth of my personal vision was complete when I recognized that the capacity of heroism
00:33:00.26 --> 00:33:14.02 is latent in everybody and only awaits the bigness of the opportunity to call it out.
00:33:14.02 --> 00:33:18.90 Different take.
00:33:18.90 --> 00:33:26.74 Obviously we talked about World War I and the less he's not the only person that felt
00:33:26.74 --> 00:33:33.54 this way about things and if this wasn't at least a fairly normal attitude to have there's
00:33:33.54 --> 00:33:37.30 no way that World War I could have continued on the way it did because people would have
00:33:37.30 --> 00:33:41.66 been saying no this is ridiculous.
00:33:41.66 --> 00:33:44.86 We just lost another 80,000 casualties.
00:33:44.86 --> 00:33:46.26 We lost another 100.
00:33:46.26 --> 00:33:54.46 These are battles where tens of thousands of people were casualties in one day and two days.
00:33:54.46 --> 00:33:58.14 So if people didn't have this kind of attitude that this was their duty they wouldn't have
00:33:58.14 --> 00:34:04.94 been able to maintain that type of that type of pace.
00:34:04.94 --> 00:34:15.78 And I don't even know whether to say I'm impressed by that or disgusted by it or disturbed.
00:34:15.78 --> 00:34:19.82 I didn't even have not disgusted but disturbed by it.
00:34:19.82 --> 00:34:21.82 Disurbed by it.
00:34:21.82 --> 00:34:25.98 And I would say all the time, you know this is the war that I would not want to fight
00:34:25.98 --> 00:34:26.98 it.
00:34:26.98 --> 00:34:29.26 Wouldn't want to fight it.
00:34:29.26 --> 00:34:34.90 Because this is the attitude is okay, your duty is to go get killed when we call.
00:34:34.90 --> 00:34:36.54 And it's just a matter how good.
00:34:36.54 --> 00:34:37.54 I say this all the time.
00:34:37.54 --> 00:34:41.66 It doesn't matter how good your tactics are, it doesn't matter how good of a leader you
00:34:41.66 --> 00:34:45.26 are because when we say go you're going to get your troops you're going to do what we say
00:34:45.26 --> 00:34:48.38 you're going to go over the top of your charge machine guns and guys you're going to
00:34:48.38 --> 00:34:55.22 get mode down.
00:34:55.22 --> 00:35:03.54 Now he goes into a little bit more about some of the battle.
00:35:03.54 --> 00:35:09.06 Back to the book, all this April, high above the shouting of the guns are larks.
00:35:09.06 --> 00:35:15.38 The larks, saying joyously, the scarlet of the poppies, the song of the larks, the lamp shining
00:35:15.38 --> 00:35:22.02 on the altar are the only external signs of the uncorcomable happy religion which lies
00:35:22.02 --> 00:35:25.38 in the hearts of our men.
00:35:25.38 --> 00:35:33.46 Their religion is the religion of heroism which they have learned in the glory
00:35:33.46 --> 00:35:36.98 of the trenches.
00:35:36.98 --> 00:35:42.86 There was a line from William Morris's earthly paradise which is like a long epic poem.
00:35:42.86 --> 00:35:48.30 It's almost like a novel which used to haunt me especially in the early days when I was
00:35:48.30 --> 00:35:51.74 first experiencing what war really meant.
00:35:51.74 --> 00:35:58.18 It reads his follows of heaven or hell I have no power to sing.
00:35:58.18 --> 00:36:07.30 I cannot ease the burden of your fears or make quick coming death a little thing.
00:36:07.30 --> 00:36:13.66 It's the last line that makes me smile rather quietly or make quick coming death a little
00:36:13.66 --> 00:36:15.38 thing.
00:36:15.38 --> 00:36:29.18 I smile because the souls who wear khaki have learned to do just that.
00:36:29.18 --> 00:36:34.22 These guys, this fear of death that people have and this poem that says, hey you can't
00:36:34.22 --> 00:36:35.94 make quick death.
00:36:35.94 --> 00:36:37.70 Quick coming death, you can't make that into a little thing.
00:36:37.70 --> 00:36:40.06 It's going to be huge anomalous.
00:36:40.06 --> 00:36:41.06 Guess what?
00:36:41.06 --> 00:36:45.06 These guys are okay with it.
00:36:45.06 --> 00:36:51.94 Back to the book, how typical he is of the days before the war when the people had only
00:36:51.94 --> 00:36:54.74 pinprix to endure.
00:36:54.74 --> 00:36:58.74 And consequently didn't exert themselves to be brave.
00:36:58.74 --> 00:37:05.02 A big sacrifice which bank rubs one's life is always more bearable than the little
00:37:05.02 --> 00:37:11.54 inevitable annoyances of sickness, disappointment and dying in a bed.
00:37:11.54 --> 00:37:18.54 The burden of our fears has slipped from our shoulders in our attempt to do something for
00:37:18.54 --> 00:37:20.90 others.
00:37:20.90 --> 00:37:28.74 The unbelievable and long-covided miracle has happened at last to every soul who has grasped
00:37:28.74 --> 00:37:39.02 his chance of heroism, quick coming death has become a fifth rate calamity.
00:37:39.02 --> 00:37:40.02 Think about that.
00:37:40.02 --> 00:37:42.26 Never get whatever.
00:37:42.26 --> 00:37:43.26 Whatever.
00:37:43.26 --> 00:37:44.26 You're no big deal to me.
00:37:44.26 --> 00:37:49.70 You're a fifth rate calamity.
00:37:49.70 --> 00:37:50.70 Back to the book.
00:37:50.70 --> 00:37:55.42 In saying this, I do not mean to glorify war.
00:37:55.42 --> 00:37:59.90 War can never be anything but beastly and damnable.
00:37:59.90 --> 00:38:06.26 It dates back to the jungle, but there are two kinds of war.
00:38:06.26 --> 00:38:11.94 There's the kind that highway men wages when he pounces from the bushes and assaults a
00:38:11.94 --> 00:38:15.46 defenseless woman.
00:38:15.46 --> 00:38:21.22 Then there's also the kind where you wage when you go to rescue her.
00:38:21.22 --> 00:38:27.30 The highway man can't expect to come out of that fight with a loft or your morality, but
00:38:27.30 --> 00:38:29.78 you can.
00:38:29.78 --> 00:38:31.82 Our chaps never want to defy.
00:38:31.82 --> 00:38:34.62 They hate fighting.
00:38:34.62 --> 00:38:42.10 It's that hatred of the thing they are compelled to do that makes them so terrible.
00:38:42.10 --> 00:38:49.06 He goes back and he's talking now about that wooden figure of Christ that he had seen.
00:38:49.06 --> 00:38:55.22 The wooden Christ gays down from them on his cross with a suffering which 2,000 years
00:38:55.22 --> 00:38:59.06 ago he had shared.
00:38:59.06 --> 00:39:04.74 The terrible pity of his silence seemed to be telling them that they had become one with him
00:39:04.74 --> 00:39:07.70 in their final sacrifice.
00:39:07.70 --> 00:39:17.18 They hadn't lived his life far from it, but unknowingly they had died his death.
00:39:17.18 --> 00:39:23.70 That's a part of the glory of the trenches that a man who has not been good can crucify
00:39:23.70 --> 00:39:29.58 himself and hang beside Christ in the end.
00:39:29.58 --> 00:39:36.46 So go out on the battlefield and you sacrifice your life, you will, all of your sins are
00:39:36.46 --> 00:39:50.66 gone, you're washed away and you hang beside Christ in the end.
00:39:50.66 --> 00:39:57.78 God as we see him and do we see him, I think so, but not always consciously.
00:39:57.78 --> 00:40:02.58 He moves among us in the forms of our brother men.
00:40:02.58 --> 00:40:09.14 We see him most evidently when danger is most threatening and courage is at its highest.
00:40:09.14 --> 00:40:11.34 We often don't recognize him out loud.
00:40:11.34 --> 00:40:15.70 Our chaps don't assert that there is fellow campaigners.
00:40:15.70 --> 00:40:19.62 They're too humble-minded and inarticulate for that.
00:40:19.62 --> 00:40:25.54 So he's saying, God's all around us, I see it in the guys, they're his campaigners,
00:40:25.54 --> 00:40:27.54 but they don't even, they don't say that.
00:40:27.54 --> 00:40:29.10 They don't say we're doing the work of God.
00:40:29.10 --> 00:40:32.54 They don't say we're living like God or we're living like Jesus Christ.
00:40:32.54 --> 00:40:37.70 No, they're too humble-minded and inarticulate for that.
00:40:37.70 --> 00:40:44.26 They're where they are because they want to do their bit, their duty.
00:40:44.26 --> 00:40:50.50 They're carefully disguised instinctive honor brought them there.
00:40:50.50 --> 00:40:59.42 Doing their bit in Bible language means laying down their lives for their friends.
00:40:59.42 --> 00:41:03.94 Doing their bit that covers everything.
00:41:03.94 --> 00:41:06.94 Here's an example of how God walks among us.
00:41:06.94 --> 00:41:11.90 In one of our attacks on the Psalm, all the observers up forward were uncertain as to what
00:41:11.90 --> 00:41:13.30 it happened.
00:41:13.30 --> 00:41:17.22 We didn't know whether our infantry had captured their objective, failed or gone beyond
00:41:17.22 --> 00:41:18.22 it.
00:41:18.22 --> 00:41:23.86 The battlefield, as far as the eye could reach, was a bath of mud.
00:41:23.86 --> 00:41:28.10 It is extremely easy and the excitement of an offensive when all landmarks are blotted
00:41:28.10 --> 00:41:31.30 out for our storming parties to lose their direction.
00:41:31.30 --> 00:41:34.70 If this happens, a number of dangers may result.
00:41:34.70 --> 00:41:38.90 Of Italian may find itself up in the air, which means that it failed to connect with the
00:41:38.90 --> 00:41:41.10 battalions on its left and right.
00:41:41.10 --> 00:41:45.10 This flanks are then exposed to the enemy.
00:41:45.10 --> 00:41:49.94 It may advance too far and start digging itself in at a point where it was previously
00:41:49.94 --> 00:41:55.10 arranged that our artillery should place their protective wall of fire.
00:41:55.10 --> 00:42:00.86 We, being forward artillery observers, are the eyes of the army.
00:42:00.86 --> 00:42:05.22 It is our business to watch for such contingencies to keep in touch with the situation
00:42:05.22 --> 00:42:10.62 as it progresses and to send our information back as quickly as possible.
00:42:10.62 --> 00:42:15.86 We were peering through our glasses from our point of vantage wind, far away in the thickest
00:42:15.86 --> 00:42:21.58 of the battle smoke we saw a white flag waving, sending back messages.
00:42:21.58 --> 00:42:24.94 The flag waving was repeatedly desperate.
00:42:24.94 --> 00:42:30.06 It was evident that no one had replied and probably that no one had picked up the messages.
00:42:30.06 --> 00:42:34.34 A signal who was with us, read the language for us.
00:42:34.34 --> 00:42:36.98 A company of infantry had advanced too far.
00:42:36.98 --> 00:42:40.30 They were most of them wounded.
00:42:40.30 --> 00:42:43.94 Very many of them dead and were in danger of being surrounded.
00:42:43.94 --> 00:42:48.66 They asked for artillery to place a curtain of fire in front of them and for reinforcements
00:42:48.66 --> 00:42:53.02 to be sent up.
00:42:53.02 --> 00:42:54.26 So they are in their trench.
00:42:54.26 --> 00:42:55.78 They are the artillery guys.
00:42:55.78 --> 00:42:56.78 They are looking out.
00:42:56.78 --> 00:43:00.86 They see flag which is one of the methodologies they had for signaling and communicating.
00:43:00.86 --> 00:43:01.86 You do these different signals.
00:43:01.86 --> 00:43:06.46 You can spell out words and so they are getting a signal back from this group that they might
00:43:06.46 --> 00:43:07.46 get surrounded.
00:43:07.46 --> 00:43:11.26 We are more artillery support in here.
00:43:11.26 --> 00:43:16.14 We at once famed the orders through to our artillery and notify the infantry headquarters
00:43:16.14 --> 00:43:19.38 of the division that was holding the front.
00:43:19.38 --> 00:43:24.18 But it was necessary to let those chaps know that we were aware of their predicament.
00:43:24.18 --> 00:43:26.74 They'd hang on if they knew that.
00:43:26.74 --> 00:43:35.70 Otherwise, without orders our signaler was getting his flags ready, he hopped on to the
00:43:35.70 --> 00:43:37.78 trench.
00:43:37.78 --> 00:43:40.62 He hopped out of the trench and onto the parapet.
00:43:40.62 --> 00:43:43.70 He didn't stand a 50-50 chance.
00:43:43.70 --> 00:43:50.26 The hunt was familiar with our observation station and strafed it with persistent regularity.
00:43:50.26 --> 00:43:53.34 The signaler turned to the senior officer present.
00:43:53.34 --> 00:43:55.34 What shall I send them?
00:43:55.34 --> 00:44:00.06 Tell them their messages have been received and that help is coming.
00:44:00.06 --> 00:44:02.90 Out the chaps scrambled, a flag in either hand.
00:44:02.90 --> 00:44:05.14 He was nothing but a boy.
00:44:05.14 --> 00:44:09.02 He ran, crouching like a rabbit to a hump of mud where his figure would show up against
00:44:09.02 --> 00:44:10.34 the sky.
00:44:10.34 --> 00:44:14.74 His flags commenced a waving, messages received help coming.
00:44:14.74 --> 00:44:16.22 They didn't see him at first.
00:44:16.22 --> 00:44:17.78 He had to repeat the words.
00:44:17.78 --> 00:44:20.70 We watched him breathlessly.
00:44:20.70 --> 00:44:23.14 We knew what would happen.
00:44:23.14 --> 00:44:26.10 At last, it did happen.
00:44:26.10 --> 00:44:30.62 A horn observer had spotted him and flashed the target back to his guns.
00:44:30.62 --> 00:44:35.50 All about him, the mud commenced to leap up and bubble.
00:44:35.50 --> 00:44:39.66 He went on signaling the good word to those stranded men up front.
00:44:39.66 --> 00:44:42.42 Message received, help coming.
00:44:42.42 --> 00:44:44.30 At least they'd seen him.
00:44:44.30 --> 00:44:46.06 They were signaling okay.
00:44:46.06 --> 00:44:53.18 It was at that moment that a whiz bang lifted him off his feet and landed him all of
00:44:53.18 --> 00:44:55.78 a huddle.
00:44:55.78 --> 00:44:57.82 His bit.
00:44:57.82 --> 00:45:04.26 He was what he'd volunteered to do when he came from Canada.
00:45:04.26 --> 00:45:16.62 The signal okay in the battle smoke was like a testimony to his character.
00:45:16.62 --> 00:45:21.70 So like I said, this had to be a common attitude and it's just hard for us to understand.
00:45:21.70 --> 00:45:25.90 It's hard for me that was in the military for 20 years to understand this attitude
00:45:25.90 --> 00:45:28.54 that you know what, it's your time to die now.
00:45:28.54 --> 00:45:31.58 Step up and pass their signaling back to them.
00:45:31.58 --> 00:45:35.42 I'm not saying that modern military guys don't take risks.
00:45:35.42 --> 00:45:41.58 Obviously take them enormous risks and we've got taken drastic casualties.
00:45:41.58 --> 00:45:44.54 But it is, this is definitely a different mentality.
00:45:44.54 --> 00:45:45.54 There's no doubt about it.
00:45:45.54 --> 00:45:52.46 Obviously it's a different mentality when you're losing millions of men.
00:45:52.46 --> 00:46:01.18 The millions of men.
00:46:01.18 --> 00:46:05.14 Back to the book and this is fast forward a little bit to kind of just giving a little
00:46:05.14 --> 00:46:09.58 more insight about what their outlook was.
00:46:09.58 --> 00:46:14.26 Out there in France, we used to tell each other fairy tales of how we would spend the first
00:46:14.26 --> 00:46:18.06 year of life when the war was ended.
00:46:18.06 --> 00:46:21.10 One man had a baby who had never seen.
00:46:21.10 --> 00:46:24.30 Another girl whom he was anxious to marry.
00:46:24.30 --> 00:46:28.66 My dream was more prosaic but no less ecstatic.
00:46:28.66 --> 00:46:34.54 It began and ended with a large white bed and a large white bath.
00:46:34.54 --> 00:46:40.90 For the first 365 mornings after peace had been declared, I was to be awakened by the sound
00:46:40.90 --> 00:46:44.14 of my bath being filled.
00:46:44.14 --> 00:46:49.74 Water was to be so plentiful that I could tumble off to sleep again without even troubling
00:46:49.74 --> 00:46:52.22 to turn off the tap.
00:46:52.22 --> 00:46:57.14 In France, one has to go dirty so often that the dream of always being cleaned seems
00:46:57.14 --> 00:47:01.18 as unrealizable as romance.
00:47:01.18 --> 00:47:07.62 Our drinking water is frequently brought up to us at the risk of men's lives.
00:47:07.62 --> 00:47:12.22 Carried through the mud and petrol can strap to pack horses.
00:47:12.22 --> 00:47:20.22 To use it carelessly would be like washing in men's blood.
00:47:20.22 --> 00:47:25.10 Here's another little paragraph again giving some more insight.
00:47:25.10 --> 00:47:31.50 You wouldn't think that the men would go to war to learn how to be kind but they do.
00:47:31.50 --> 00:47:35.90 There's no kind or creature in the whole wide world in the average Tommy.
00:47:35.90 --> 00:47:38.98 He makes a friend of any stray animal he can find.
00:47:38.98 --> 00:47:42.18 He shares his last friend with a chap who isn't his pal.
00:47:42.18 --> 00:47:48.18 He risks his life to die in consequently to rescue anyone who's elounded.
00:47:48.18 --> 00:47:53.70 He's gone over the top with the bomb and bayonet for the express purpose of doing in the
00:47:53.70 --> 00:47:55.54 hunt.
00:47:55.54 --> 00:47:58.74 But he makes a comrade of the fritzy he captures.
00:47:58.74 --> 00:48:03.42 You'll seem coming down the battered trenches with some scarred lad of a German at his
00:48:03.42 --> 00:48:14.42 side.
00:48:14.42 --> 00:48:21.10 Now he as I said in the beginning this we he gets wounded and at this point he's been wounded
00:48:21.10 --> 00:48:26.62 and now he's heading to Blighty which we talked about this before on the podcast.
00:48:26.62 --> 00:48:32.66 But Blighty was slaying for going back to England.
00:48:32.66 --> 00:48:39.54 Back to the book never in all my fortnight journey to Blighty did I hear a word of self pity
00:48:39.54 --> 00:48:40.82 or complaining.
00:48:40.82 --> 00:48:43.18 So he's going to the bunch of wounded people he's not hearing any complaining.
00:48:43.18 --> 00:48:48.02 On the contrary the most severely wounded men would profess themselves grateful that they had
00:48:48.02 --> 00:48:50.58 gotten off so lightly.
00:48:50.58 --> 00:48:55.26 Since the war started to turn lightly has become exceedingly comparative.
00:48:55.26 --> 00:49:01.06 I suppose a man is justified in saying he's got off lightly when what he expected was
00:49:01.06 --> 00:49:04.50 death.
00:49:04.50 --> 00:49:09.46 I remember a big highland officer who'd been shot in the kneecap.
00:49:09.46 --> 00:49:13.22 He'd been operated on and the kneecap had been found to be so splintered it had to be
00:49:13.22 --> 00:49:17.02 removed of this he was unaware.
00:49:17.02 --> 00:49:22.38 For the first day as he lay in bed he kept wondering aloud how long it would be before
00:49:22.38 --> 00:49:26.02 he could rejoin his battalion.
00:49:26.02 --> 00:49:30.38 Perhaps he suspected his condition and was trying to find out.
00:49:30.38 --> 00:49:36.98 All his heart seemed set at once on getting back into the fighting.
00:49:36.98 --> 00:49:42.74 Next morning he plucked up the courage to ask the doctor and received the answer he
00:49:42.74 --> 00:49:44.62 had dreaded.
00:49:44.62 --> 00:49:50.06 Never you won't be going back old chap.
00:49:50.06 --> 00:49:56.30 Next time he spoke his voice was a bit throaty will it stiffen?
00:49:56.30 --> 00:50:02.18 You've lost the knee joint the doctor said but with luck we'll save the leg.
00:50:02.18 --> 00:50:05.02 His voice sank to a whisper.
00:50:05.02 --> 00:50:09.58 If you do it won't be much good will it?
00:50:09.58 --> 00:50:13.10 Not much said the doctor.
00:50:13.10 --> 00:50:19.46 He lay for a couple hours silent, readjusting his mind to meet the new conditions.
00:50:19.46 --> 00:50:25.78 Then he commenced talking with cheerfulness about returning to his family.
00:50:25.78 --> 00:50:27.94 The habit of courage it conquered.
00:50:27.94 --> 00:50:33.98 The habit of courage which grows out of knowledge that you let your pals down by showing
00:50:33.98 --> 00:50:34.94 cowardice.
00:50:34.94 --> 00:50:41.78 So, took him a couple hours to adjust and said okay.
00:50:41.78 --> 00:50:49.90 Looks like I can get to go back to my family.
00:50:49.90 --> 00:50:58.26 Now we have another type of casualty here talking about men that have had major disfigurements
00:50:58.26 --> 00:51:06.46 to their faces and they would wrap their whole faces up.
00:51:06.46 --> 00:51:07.46 Back to the book.
00:51:07.46 --> 00:51:12.06 In these days that followed I saw several of these masked men.
00:51:12.06 --> 00:51:16.90 The worst cases were not allowed to walk about.
00:51:16.90 --> 00:51:22.62 The ones I saw were invariably dressed with the most scrupulous care in the smartest
00:51:22.62 --> 00:51:24.22 uniforms.
00:51:24.22 --> 00:51:30.86 Sam Browns, the best adult that goes over your shoulder, polished buttons, shining.
00:51:30.86 --> 00:51:36.02 They had hope and took a pride in themselves, a splendid sign.
00:51:36.02 --> 00:51:41.98 Perhaps you ask why the faces kept the face cases should be kept in front so the guys
00:51:41.98 --> 00:51:50.54 that had major facial disfigurements they would stay in France.
00:51:50.54 --> 00:51:54.70 I was not told but I can guess because they dread going back to England to their girls
00:51:54.70 --> 00:51:57.34 until they got rid of their disfigurements.
00:51:57.34 --> 00:52:03.34 So for two years through their bandages they watched the train pull out for Blady.
00:52:03.34 --> 00:52:19.46 All the damage which was done to them in a fragment of the second is repaired.
00:52:19.46 --> 00:52:23.90 At a base hospital you see something you don't see at casualty stations.
00:52:23.90 --> 00:52:30.02 Sisters, mothers, sweethearts and wives sitting beside the beds.
00:52:30.02 --> 00:52:34.66 They're allowed to come over from England when their man is dying.
00:52:34.66 --> 00:52:38.42 One of the wonderful things to me was to observe how these women in the hour of their
00:52:38.42 --> 00:52:42.66 tragedy catch this soldier's spirit.
00:52:42.66 --> 00:52:47.10 They're very quiet, very cheerful, very helpful.
00:52:47.10 --> 00:52:51.66 While passing through the ward they get to know some of the other patients and remember
00:52:51.66 --> 00:52:53.30 them.
00:52:53.30 --> 00:52:57.90 When they bring their own man flowers, sometimes when their own man is asleep they slip
00:52:57.90 --> 00:53:02.46 over to other bedcites and do something kind for the solitary fellows.
00:53:02.46 --> 00:53:04.30 That's the army all over.
00:53:04.30 --> 00:53:09.58 Military discipline is based on unselfishness.
00:53:09.58 --> 00:53:15.86 These women who have been sent to see their men die catch from them the spirit of undistressed
00:53:15.86 --> 00:53:23.42 sacrifice and enroll themselves as soldiers.
00:53:23.42 --> 00:53:29.90 You discover the spirit of the man when you've heard him wandering in delirium.
00:53:29.90 --> 00:53:36.14 So you talk in a little bit about the obviously guys that are suffering from shell shock
00:53:36.14 --> 00:53:40.02 is what they call it, what they used to call it in World War I.
00:53:40.02 --> 00:53:46.30 Guys that are having some mental issues all night in the shadowy ward with its hooded
00:53:46.30 --> 00:53:47.30 lamps.
00:53:47.30 --> 00:53:49.82 He would be giving orders for the comfort of his men.
00:53:49.82 --> 00:53:53.54 Sometimes he'd be proposing to go forward himself to a place where a company was having
00:53:53.54 --> 00:53:55.34 a hot time.
00:53:55.34 --> 00:53:58.46 Apparently one of his officers was trying to dissuade him.
00:53:58.46 --> 00:54:01.90 Danger be damned, he'd exclaim in a wonderfully strong voice.
00:54:01.90 --> 00:54:12.50 It'll buck him up to see me, splendid japs, splendid japs.
00:54:12.50 --> 00:54:17.30 For the soldier it seems that the war has always been and that they will never cease
00:54:17.30 --> 00:54:18.74 to being soldiers.
00:54:18.74 --> 00:54:26.90 For them both the past and the future are utterly obliterated.
00:54:26.90 --> 00:54:34.46 They would not have it otherwise, because they are doing their duty they are contented.
00:54:34.46 --> 00:54:39.94 The only time the subject is ever touched on is when someone expresses the hope that
00:54:39.94 --> 00:54:45.66 it'll last long enough for them to recover from his wounds and get back to the line.
00:54:45.66 --> 00:54:51.66 That usually starts another man who will never be any good, never be any more good for the
00:54:51.66 --> 00:54:56.90 trenches wondering whether he can get into the flying corps.
00:54:56.90 --> 00:55:02.78 The one ultimate hope of all these shattered wrecks who are being hurried to blighty.
00:55:02.78 --> 00:55:09.90 They have dreamt of is that they may see service again.
00:55:09.90 --> 00:55:12.06 We still hear that.
00:55:12.06 --> 00:55:17.06 We still hear that.
00:55:17.06 --> 00:55:18.70 I heard that.
00:55:18.70 --> 00:55:22.26 I talked about hearing that from Ryan Job who was blind and he's back at America and he's
00:55:22.26 --> 00:55:25.62 like let me come back.
00:55:25.62 --> 00:55:30.74 My first guy that I ever had would get wounded bad.
00:55:30.74 --> 00:55:36.38 I went to see him in the medical outstation.
00:55:36.38 --> 00:55:39.10 I just went down to like shake his hand and he was on morphing.
00:55:39.10 --> 00:55:43.74 He had been shot the leg. He didn't know if he was going to lose the leg or not.
00:55:43.74 --> 00:55:49.30 I went down and gave him, I went to shake his hand and he pulled me in and he's like
00:55:49.30 --> 00:55:52.02 let me stay.
00:55:52.02 --> 00:55:55.06 I was just like you man.
00:55:55.06 --> 00:55:56.98 What an awesome brother right there.
00:55:56.98 --> 00:55:57.98 This is not rare.
00:55:57.98 --> 00:55:58.98 This still happens.
00:55:58.98 --> 00:56:00.62 You hear this all the time.
00:56:00.62 --> 00:56:09.06 There's guys in the US military that go back to combat with one leg with one hand.
00:56:09.06 --> 00:56:13.66 I mean, even Jodi was like talking about, you know, when he woke up and showed him
00:56:13.66 --> 00:56:15.38 a medical who he was in the park.
00:56:15.38 --> 00:56:20.10 When he woke up and he found out that they took both of his legs.
00:56:20.10 --> 00:56:24.66 He was pissed because one leg you can still go back on the planet but two leg can't do
00:56:24.66 --> 00:56:25.66 it.
00:56:25.66 --> 00:56:31.02 So Jodi the badass was just like, no look.
00:56:31.02 --> 00:56:37.26 How am I going to go back now?
00:56:37.26 --> 00:56:42.30 Some of us will be back in the fighting and Jolly Glad of it.
00:56:42.30 --> 00:56:46.26 Others are doomed to remain in the trenches for the rest of their lives, not the trenches
00:56:46.26 --> 00:56:52.18 of the front line where they've been strafed by the hunt, but the trenches of physical
00:56:52.18 --> 00:56:59.42 curtailment where self-pity will launch wave after wave of attack against them.
00:56:59.42 --> 00:57:05.50 It won't be easy not to get the wind up.
00:57:05.50 --> 00:57:11.94 It'll be difficult to maintain normal cheerfulness but they're not the men they were before
00:57:11.94 --> 00:57:13.90 they went to war.
00:57:13.90 --> 00:57:16.54 Out there they've learned something.
00:57:16.54 --> 00:57:20.94 Their game, they'll remain soldiers whatever happens.
00:57:20.94 --> 00:57:27.46 So he's talking about these guys that are aren't going to be able to make it back and
00:57:27.46 --> 00:57:31.70 he's saying they're going to be hard for him.
00:57:31.70 --> 00:57:34.98 But he's saying that they're game but they're going to bring it.
00:57:34.98 --> 00:57:40.06 Is there going to remain soldiers regardless of what happens?
00:57:40.06 --> 00:57:47.94 Now this is a pretty interesting piece where he goes back to New York where like I said
00:57:47.94 --> 00:57:53.94 he had spent some time there and he's talking a little about what it's like in New York.
00:57:53.94 --> 00:57:59.22 He says there's one person I've missed since my return to New York.
00:57:59.22 --> 00:58:04.90 I've caught glimpses of him disappearing around corners but he dodges.
00:58:04.90 --> 00:58:08.98 I think he's a bit ashamed to meet me.
00:58:08.98 --> 00:58:14.10 That person is my old civilian self.
00:58:14.10 --> 00:58:17.74 What a full blown egoist he used to be.
00:58:17.74 --> 00:58:21.94 How full of gold and plans for his own advancement.
00:58:21.94 --> 00:58:32.66 How terrified of failure, of disease, of money losses, of death, of all the temporary external,
00:58:32.66 --> 00:58:40.42 non-essential things that have nothing to do with the spirit.
00:58:40.42 --> 00:58:46.94 War in itself is damnable.
00:58:46.94 --> 00:58:58.34 It's a extravagant, wasteful use of resources, a misuse of accumulated brain stuff of centuries.
00:58:58.34 --> 00:59:04.94 Nevertheless, there's many a man who has no love of war, who previous the war had cramped
00:59:04.94 --> 00:59:10.82 his soul with littleness and was chased by the bayonet of duty into the bloodstained
00:59:10.82 --> 00:59:22.10 largeness of the trenches who is alert to say thank God for this war.
00:59:22.10 --> 00:59:27.10 He thinks God not because of the carnage.
00:59:27.10 --> 00:59:34.26 But because when the wine-pressive new ideals was being trotting, he was born in an age
00:59:34.26 --> 00:59:41.26 where he could do his share.
00:59:41.26 --> 00:59:47.66 Often at the front, I have thought of Christ's explanation of his own unassailable peace.
00:59:47.66 --> 00:59:52.98 An explanation given to his disciples at the last supper, be of good cheer I have overcome
00:59:52.98 --> 00:59:55.70 the world.
00:59:55.70 --> 01:00:02.54 Overcoming the world, as I understand it, is overcoming fear.
01:00:02.54 --> 01:00:07.98 And it's final analysis is nothing but selfishness.
01:00:07.98 --> 01:00:14.34 A man who is afraid in the attack isn't thinking of his pals, of his pals, and how quickly
01:00:14.34 --> 01:00:15.58 terror spreads.
01:00:15.58 --> 01:00:19.62 He isn't thinking of the glory which we will accrue to his regiment or division if the
01:00:19.62 --> 01:00:21.22 attack is a success.
01:00:21.22 --> 01:00:26.06 He isn't thinking of what he can do to contribute to that success.
01:00:26.06 --> 01:00:33.30 He isn't thinking of the splendor of forcing his spirit to triumph over weiriness and
01:00:33.30 --> 01:00:40.06 nerves and the abominations that the hunts are chucking at him.
01:00:40.06 --> 01:00:47.30 He's merely thinking of how he can save his worthless skin and conduct his entirely
01:00:47.30 --> 01:01:00.10 unimportant body to a place where there aren't any shells.
01:01:00.10 --> 01:01:07.02 In London, as I saw the work of day, unconscious nobility of the maimed and wounded, the
01:01:07.02 --> 01:01:12.34 words I have overcome the world took an added depth.
01:01:12.34 --> 01:01:18.58 All these men have a eye of overcome the world looking their faces.
01:01:18.58 --> 01:01:26.34 It is comparatively easy for a soldier with traditions and ideals to get back to face
01:01:26.34 --> 01:01:37.26 death calmly, to become in the face of life as these chaps are takes graver courage.
01:01:37.26 --> 01:01:40.14 What has happened to them?
01:01:40.14 --> 01:01:43.10 Is attitude of mind or greatness of soul?
01:01:43.10 --> 01:01:49.58 Whatever you like to call it was learned in the trenches, where everything outward is polluted
01:01:49.58 --> 01:01:52.58 and damnable.
01:01:52.58 --> 01:02:00.82 Their experience at the front has given them what in the army language is known as guts,
01:02:00.82 --> 01:02:06.10 courage is an attitude of mind towards calamity and attitude of mind which makes the
01:02:06.10 --> 01:02:16.02 honorable accomplishing of duty more permanently satisfying than the preservation of self.
01:02:16.02 --> 01:02:22.14 Like I said, when I kicked this off, this is a different powerful angle to look at these
01:02:22.14 --> 01:02:23.14 things.
01:02:23.14 --> 01:02:24.14 I have talked about this as well.
01:02:24.14 --> 01:02:28.54 I don't know if you Sam Harris asked me.
01:02:28.54 --> 01:02:32.38 I was saying that hey, war shows you a lot of beauty in the juice where you get to see
01:02:32.38 --> 01:02:38.10 these incredible capacity of humanity.
01:02:38.10 --> 01:02:43.06 He said, you know, you say that, but I've also heard you describe war as horrible and
01:02:43.06 --> 01:02:48.70 I kind of gave him an answer about, you know, I asked him, I said, hey, if they've
01:02:48.70 --> 01:02:50.82 never known you, but survived cancer.
01:02:50.82 --> 01:02:56.70 He said, yes, and I'm like, yeah, and when they survive it, a lot of them say it opened
01:02:56.70 --> 01:03:01.06 my mind, it freed me from being afraid and it did all these wonderful things.
01:03:01.06 --> 01:03:06.46 I'm like, I would never wish it on anybody, but they don't, they don't wish that it
01:03:06.46 --> 01:03:07.46 didn't happen either.
01:03:07.46 --> 01:03:08.54 They learned so much from it.
01:03:08.54 --> 01:03:15.34 And that's how I feel about war and that's kind of what I read in a lot of this is Dawson
01:03:15.34 --> 01:03:23.58 saying, look, you are so changed by this and regardless of the horrors, the change is positive.
01:03:23.58 --> 01:03:31.70 It opens your eyes in a way that nothing else can.
01:03:31.70 --> 01:03:38.06 Back to the book, that's the kind of peep that God we got on the Western front.
01:03:38.06 --> 01:03:43.82 It is in the sad peep either, when men die for something worthwhile, death loses all its
01:03:43.82 --> 01:03:46.10 terror.
01:03:46.10 --> 01:03:52.62 It's peetering out in bed, from sickness or old age that's so horrifying.
01:03:52.62 --> 01:03:57.02 Many a man whose cowardice is at longer heads with a sense of duty comes to the front
01:03:57.02 --> 01:03:59.94 as a non-combatant.
01:03:59.94 --> 01:04:05.38 He compromises with his conscious and takes a bombproof job in some service whose places
01:04:05.38 --> 01:04:07.18 well behind the lines.
01:04:07.18 --> 01:04:10.22 So he's saying, okay, a lot of guys, they're like, hey, you know what, I'm kind of scared.
01:04:10.22 --> 01:04:13.38 I just want to, you know, just give me a easy job.
01:04:13.38 --> 01:04:16.86 Just, you know, I don't want to get killed.
01:04:16.86 --> 01:04:20.62 Back to the book, he doesn't stop there long.
01:04:20.62 --> 01:04:23.02 He's a decent, sir, sort.
01:04:23.02 --> 01:04:27.62 Having learned more than he ever guests before about the brutal things that Shellfire
01:04:27.62 --> 01:04:32.62 can do to you, he transfers into a fighting unit.
01:04:32.62 --> 01:04:34.62 Why?
01:04:34.62 --> 01:04:39.02 Because danger doesn't appall, it allures.
01:04:39.02 --> 01:04:40.62 It holds a challenge.
01:04:40.62 --> 01:04:42.94 It stings one's pride.
01:04:42.94 --> 01:04:47.78 It urges one to seek out ascending scales of risk.
01:04:47.78 --> 01:04:54.02 It's to prove to himself he isn't flabby.
01:04:54.02 --> 01:04:55.82 And flabby's actually another word that I looked up.
01:04:55.82 --> 01:05:00.22 There's an old, kind of capture what the real meaning is.
01:05:00.22 --> 01:05:02.22 And then there's the definition.
01:05:02.22 --> 01:05:07.50 Another definition is lacking strength or determination.
01:05:07.50 --> 01:05:10.94 Now this is classic.
01:05:10.94 --> 01:05:17.14 The safe job is the only job for which there's no competition in fighting units.
01:05:17.14 --> 01:05:24.26 You have to persuade men to be grooms or cooks or bat men.
01:05:24.26 --> 01:05:29.78 If you're seeking volunteers for a chance at annihilation, you'll have to cast lots to
01:05:29.78 --> 01:05:34.86 avoid the offense of rejecting.
01:05:34.86 --> 01:05:39.70 All of this is inexplicable to civilians.
01:05:39.70 --> 01:05:42.02 And again, this is something I saw with my own two eyes.
01:05:42.02 --> 01:05:44.54 And I talked about this in my retirement speech in Ramadi.
01:05:44.54 --> 01:05:48.42 And I was like, okay, we need volunteers who wants to go over and live in this hellhold
01:05:48.42 --> 01:05:52.02 and Eastern Ramadi and go out on operations where we're going to be taking casualties.
01:05:52.02 --> 01:05:56.14 It's going to be a nightmare and I can promise you nothing but blood, sweat, and tears.
01:05:56.14 --> 01:06:00.42 Who, if you want to go on that, if you want to go there, not not for one operation, but
01:06:00.42 --> 01:06:02.78 I'm going to put you there for six months.
01:06:02.78 --> 01:06:05.90 So who, you know, if you want that, put your name on the board.
01:06:05.90 --> 01:06:07.90 Every single guy does it.
01:06:07.90 --> 01:06:09.90 Every single guy does it.
01:06:09.90 --> 01:06:13.34 And that's exactly what he's talking about here.
01:06:13.34 --> 01:06:14.34 That's exactly how's it?
01:06:14.34 --> 01:06:17.22 As a matter of fact, I hooked up with a trooper down in New Zealand.
01:06:17.22 --> 01:06:18.94 Did you just do play or?
01:06:18.94 --> 01:06:20.94 And we were talking to you.
01:06:20.94 --> 01:06:27.58 He was using the in the commandos, in the Ramrian commandos, 40 commandos.
01:06:27.58 --> 01:06:34.10 And he was going to get moved to being a cook for his go four year duty as a cook.
01:06:34.10 --> 01:06:37.26 His work is going to get tasked with and he got out of the room.
01:06:37.26 --> 01:06:39.18 He got out of the room, rinse because you know what?
01:06:39.18 --> 01:06:40.90 He said, I'm not going to be a cook.
01:06:40.90 --> 01:06:43.18 You know, I'm a warrior.
01:06:43.18 --> 01:06:45.06 I want to go and get after it.
01:06:45.06 --> 01:06:49.70 So that's like, you see that, in this modern day, you know, I'm talking about how different
01:06:49.70 --> 01:06:52.18 it was back then, but maybe it was as different as I think it is.
01:06:52.18 --> 01:06:53.18 Yeah.
01:06:53.18 --> 01:06:57.18 Because we still got troopers that are just willing to step up all the time.
01:06:57.18 --> 01:06:58.38 And that's that's one thing that's awesome.
01:06:58.38 --> 01:07:03.18 You know, again, from my experience in the in the in the in the seal teams, you know,
01:07:03.18 --> 01:07:06.58 when I went in there was no war going on, I kind of thought that there was, but
01:07:06.58 --> 01:07:07.58 there wasn't.
01:07:07.58 --> 01:07:10.98 But these guys, these kids that come in now, they know where they're going.
01:07:10.98 --> 01:07:12.58 They know there's a war going on.
01:07:12.58 --> 01:07:14.58 They know they're going to get after it.
01:07:14.58 --> 01:07:16.58 And they're lining up.
01:07:16.58 --> 01:07:23.78 I know man, it's crazy how many people I see their reason to join is to go fight these bad
01:07:23.78 --> 01:07:24.78 guys.
01:07:24.78 --> 01:07:27.58 It's not because I don't have anything better to do or not.
01:07:27.58 --> 01:07:31.18 It's like, nah, I want to I want to quit my job and go fight.
01:07:31.18 --> 01:07:33.38 Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
01:07:33.38 --> 01:07:38.18 No doubt about it.
01:07:38.18 --> 01:07:42.78 Now I like this because we start hammering on some philosophers a little bit.
01:07:42.78 --> 01:07:47.18 No offense to a Darryl Cooper and Margar made because he's a big philosophy guy.
01:07:47.18 --> 01:07:52.18 I know where you're at Cooper.
01:07:52.18 --> 01:07:53.58 I'm going to agree with Dawson on this one.
01:07:53.58 --> 01:07:54.58 Here we go.
01:07:54.58 --> 01:07:55.58 Back to the book.
01:07:55.58 --> 01:08:01.58 If civilian philosophers fail to explain us, we can explain them.
01:08:01.58 --> 01:08:06.58 In their world, they are the center of their universe.
01:08:06.58 --> 01:08:09.18 They look inward instead of outward.
01:08:09.18 --> 01:08:14.98 The sun rises and sets to minister to their particular happiness.
01:08:14.98 --> 01:08:20.78 If they die, the stars would vanish.
01:08:20.78 --> 01:08:27.78 We understand a few months ago, we too were like that.
01:08:27.78 --> 01:08:33.78 What makes us reckless of death is our intense gratitude that we have altered.
01:08:33.78 --> 01:08:43.50 We want to prove ourselves and access how utterly changed we are from what we were.
01:08:43.50 --> 01:08:51.58 In his secret heart, the egoist is a self-despisor.
01:08:51.58 --> 01:08:57.90 Can you imagine what a difference it works in a man after years of self-contempt at least
01:08:57.90 --> 01:09:02.82 for one brief moment to approve of himself?
01:09:02.82 --> 01:09:06.86 Since we can remember, we are chained to the prison house of our bodies.
01:09:06.86 --> 01:09:16.82 We live to feed our bodies to close our bodies to preserve our bodies to minister to their passions.
01:09:16.82 --> 01:09:25.70 Now we know that our bodies are mere flimsy shells in which our souls are paramount.
01:09:25.70 --> 01:09:27.94 We can fling them aside in a minute.
01:09:27.94 --> 01:09:29.50 They become ignoble.
01:09:29.50 --> 01:09:34.34 The moment the soul has departed, we have proof.
01:09:34.34 --> 01:09:43.74 Often, at zero hour, we have seen whole populations of cities go over the top in vanish.
01:09:43.74 --> 01:09:49.82 Weaving behind their bloody rags.
01:09:49.82 --> 01:09:53.94 We should go mad if we did not believe in immortality.
01:09:53.94 --> 01:09:56.90 We know that the physical is not the essential part.
01:09:56.90 --> 01:10:06.34 How better can a man shake off his flesh than at the hour when his spirit is most shining?
01:10:06.34 --> 01:10:13.78 The exact day when he dies does not matter tomorrow or 50 years hence, the vital concern
01:10:13.78 --> 01:10:16.98 is not when.
01:10:16.98 --> 01:10:21.50 But how?
01:10:21.50 --> 01:10:27.30 The civilian philosopher considers what we've lost.
01:10:27.30 --> 01:10:39.50 He forgets that it could never have been ours for long.
01:10:39.50 --> 01:10:40.50 Giving up the self.
01:10:40.50 --> 01:10:46.18 There's some Zen and I'm no Buddhist monk, but there's a lot of Zen philosophy in there,
01:10:46.18 --> 01:10:47.18 too.
01:10:47.18 --> 01:10:50.02 You're completely surrendering yourself.
01:10:50.02 --> 01:10:52.78 And that's a powerful, powerful thing.
01:10:52.78 --> 01:10:55.90 You look like you really liked that last part there.
01:10:55.90 --> 01:11:00.90 It's heavy stuff.
01:11:00.90 --> 01:11:06.14 Here he goes down the same vein, comparing civilian life.
01:11:06.14 --> 01:11:09.14 And so he was talking about civilian philosophers.
01:11:09.14 --> 01:11:14.70 Now he's going to go into just talking about the civilian, even how civilian spend their
01:11:14.70 --> 01:11:18.94 life and how he used to spend his life.
01:11:18.94 --> 01:11:20.14 Here we go back to the book.
01:11:20.14 --> 01:11:23.50 We probably caught a train in every morning.
01:11:23.50 --> 01:11:27.22 The same train we went to a business where we sat at a desk.
01:11:27.22 --> 01:11:31.26 Neither the business nor the desk ever altered.
01:11:31.26 --> 01:11:37.54 We received the same strafing from the same employer or if we were the employer we administered
01:11:37.54 --> 01:11:40.70 the same strafing.
01:11:40.70 --> 01:11:45.66 We only did these things that we might eat bread.
01:11:45.66 --> 01:11:56.78 Our dreams were all selfish of more clothes, more respect, more food, bigger houses.
01:11:56.78 --> 01:12:06.62 The least part of the day we've devoted to the people and the things we really cared for.
01:12:06.62 --> 01:12:16.78 And the people we loved, we weren't always even nice to them.
01:12:16.78 --> 01:12:21.62 And then he breaks and he goes into what it is being a soldier.
01:12:21.62 --> 01:12:29.26 He says, being a soldier is doing a man's job, doing it for someone else and unafraid to
01:12:29.26 --> 01:12:35.98 meet God.
01:12:35.98 --> 01:12:42.74 And now he's about to go and discuss where this comes from.
01:12:42.74 --> 01:12:43.74 Nevertheless, it is true.
01:12:43.74 --> 01:12:46.70 It isn't natural to be brave.
01:12:46.70 --> 01:12:54.78 How then have multitudes of man acquired this sudden act of courage?
01:12:54.78 --> 01:13:00.82 They have acquired it through discipline and training.
01:13:00.82 --> 01:13:07.78 When you have subjected yourself to discipline, you cease to think of yourself.
01:13:07.78 --> 01:13:12.90 You are not you, but part of a company of men.
01:13:12.90 --> 01:13:17.14 If you don't do your duty, you throw the whole machine out.
01:13:17.14 --> 01:13:22.30 You soon learn the hard lesson that every man's life and every man's service belongs to other
01:13:22.30 --> 01:13:24.66 people.
01:13:24.66 --> 01:13:31.26 If this, the organization of an army is a vivid illustration, take the infantry for instance.
01:13:31.26 --> 01:13:33.42 They can't fight by themselves.
01:13:33.42 --> 01:13:35.34 They're dependent on the support of the artillery.
01:13:35.34 --> 01:13:41.58 The artillery in turn would be terribly crippled or not for the gallantry of the air service.
01:13:41.58 --> 01:13:45.46 If the infantry collapse, the guns have to go back.
01:13:45.46 --> 01:13:48.30 If the infantry advance, the guns have to be pulled forward.
01:13:48.30 --> 01:13:52.90 This close interdependence of service on service division on division, battalion on
01:13:52.90 --> 01:13:59.78 battalion follows right down through the army till it reaches the individual.
01:13:59.78 --> 01:14:07.14 So that each man feels that the day will be lost if he fails.
01:14:07.14 --> 01:14:15.10 His imagination becomes intrigued by the immensity of the stakes for which he plays.
01:14:15.10 --> 01:14:22.14 Any physical calamity which may happen to himself becomes trifling when compared with
01:14:22.14 --> 01:14:33.66 the disgrace he would bring upon his regiment if he were not courageous.
01:14:33.66 --> 01:14:44.14 Now I'm about to read a piece that's, it's just a story he tells a story within a story.
01:14:44.14 --> 01:14:45.50 And we'll go right to it.
01:14:45.50 --> 01:14:51.46 A few months ago I was handling over a battery position in a fairly warm place.
01:14:51.46 --> 01:14:57.22 The major who came up to take over for me brought with him a subaltern and just enough
01:14:57.22 --> 01:14:59.22 men to run the guns.
01:14:59.22 --> 01:15:04.82 Within a half an hour of their arrival, a stray shell came in and caught the subaltern
01:15:04.82 --> 01:15:08.02 in five of the gun detachment.
01:15:08.02 --> 01:15:13.46 As plain at once that the subaltern was dying, his name must have been written on the
01:15:13.46 --> 01:15:16.66 shell as we say in France.
01:15:16.66 --> 01:15:24.54 We got a stretcher and made all haste to rush him out to a dressing station.
01:15:24.54 --> 01:15:27.94 Just as he was leaving, he asked to speak with his major.
01:15:27.94 --> 01:15:28.94 I'm sorry sir.
01:15:28.94 --> 01:15:30.46 I didn't mean to get wounded.
01:15:30.46 --> 01:15:32.98 He whispered.
01:15:32.98 --> 01:15:37.58 The last word he sent back from the dressing station where he died was tell the major I didn't
01:15:37.58 --> 01:15:41.70 mean to do it.
01:15:41.70 --> 01:15:42.70 That's the discipline.
01:15:42.70 --> 01:15:44.54 He didn't think of himself.
01:15:44.54 --> 01:15:53.42 All he thought of was that his major would be left short handed.
01:15:53.42 --> 01:16:05.06 He's about to tell another story that is, well I'm just going to read it.
01:16:05.06 --> 01:16:09.90 Last spring the night before an attack, a man was brought into battalion headquarters dug
01:16:09.90 --> 01:16:14.34 out under arrest.
01:16:14.34 --> 01:16:21.78 The colonel and the agitant were busy attending the last details of their preparations.
01:16:21.78 --> 01:16:23.78 The agitant looked up irritably.
01:16:23.78 --> 01:16:25.94 What is it?
01:16:25.94 --> 01:16:32.98 The NCO of the guard answered, we found this man's sir in a communication trench.
01:16:32.98 --> 01:16:35.98 His company has been in the front line for two hours.
01:16:35.98 --> 01:16:40.78 He was sitting down with his equipment thrown away and evidently has no intention of
01:16:40.78 --> 01:16:44.30 going up.
01:16:44.30 --> 01:16:49.18 The agitant glanced coldly at the prisoner.
01:16:49.18 --> 01:16:50.78 One of you to say for yourself.
01:16:50.78 --> 01:16:52.46 So you understand this?
01:16:52.46 --> 01:16:54.90 So they found this soldier.
01:16:54.90 --> 01:16:58.90 He was his troops were up and fighting on the front line for two hours.
01:16:58.90 --> 01:17:00.38 They find him.
01:17:00.38 --> 01:17:04.26 He's got his radio strewn about and they say, are you going to go fight with your men?
01:17:04.26 --> 01:17:06.78 And he says he's not going to go.
01:17:06.78 --> 01:17:09.94 So the agitant glanced coldly at the prisoner.
01:17:09.94 --> 01:17:12.62 What of you to say for yourself?
01:17:12.62 --> 01:17:18.06 The man was ghastly white and shaking like an aspirin.
01:17:18.06 --> 01:17:21.26 Sir, I'm not the man I was since I saw my best friend Jimmy.
01:17:21.26 --> 01:17:25.18 We had his head blown off and lying in his hands.
01:17:25.18 --> 01:17:27.18 It's kind of got me.
01:17:27.18 --> 01:17:32.22 I can't face up to it.
01:17:32.22 --> 01:17:36.70 The agitant was silent for a few seconds.
01:17:36.70 --> 01:17:41.14 Then he said, you have a double choice.
01:17:41.14 --> 01:17:48.34 I can either be shot up there doing your duty or behind the lines as a coward.
01:17:48.34 --> 01:17:50.42 It's for you to choose.
01:17:50.42 --> 01:17:55.02 I don't care.
01:17:55.02 --> 01:17:57.54 The interview is ended.
01:17:57.54 --> 01:17:59.90 He turned again to the Colonel.
01:17:59.90 --> 01:18:09.86 The man slowly straightened himself, saluted like a soldier and marched out alone to the front.
01:18:09.86 --> 01:18:22.18 That's what discipline does for a man who's going back on himself.
01:18:22.18 --> 01:18:27.58 Like I said, I'm not even sure how I feel about that story.
01:18:27.58 --> 01:18:30.38 I actually don't know.
01:18:30.38 --> 01:18:32.78 You got a guy in the hack where he talks about this dick.
01:18:32.78 --> 01:18:33.78 Winners talked about this.
01:18:33.78 --> 01:18:37.30 Where you get guys that they're broken.
01:18:37.30 --> 01:18:41.94 You've got to give him a break.
01:18:41.94 --> 01:18:45.18 What had this guy been through God only knows.
01:18:45.18 --> 01:18:46.90 Obviously, he saw his friend get killed.
01:18:46.90 --> 01:18:51.38 I'm sure he was near death over and over again.
01:18:51.38 --> 01:18:56.06 The Colonel just says, you either get out there and die.
01:18:56.06 --> 01:19:00.90 You die back here as a coward.
01:19:00.90 --> 01:19:15.86 There's like a part of me that is filled with admiration.
01:19:15.86 --> 01:19:22.02 The guy obviously overcomes his fears and there's also a part of me that's filled with horror
01:19:22.02 --> 01:19:27.34 because he overcomes his fears.
01:19:27.34 --> 01:19:40.86 To give that final order and for the soldier to give that final salute, it's just all
01:19:40.86 --> 01:19:47.42 of it, the bravery and at the same time, the cowlessness and at the same time, the fear
01:19:47.42 --> 01:20:02.30 and the dedication to duty and yet it's dedication to madness.
01:20:02.30 --> 01:20:10.70 And again, it's a window into human nature.
01:20:10.70 --> 01:20:17.78 And what people go through and what people will do and won't do and what it takes to get
01:20:17.78 --> 01:20:26.62 him there.
01:20:26.62 --> 01:20:28.82 Back to the book.
01:20:28.82 --> 01:20:35.66 One of the big influences that helps keep a soldier's soul sanitary is what's known in the
01:20:35.66 --> 01:20:40.66 British Army as spit and polish.
01:20:40.66 --> 01:20:45.74 Basically we pull out for a rest we start to working, burnishing and washing.
01:20:45.74 --> 01:20:50.34 The chaps may have shown the most brilliant courage and self-sacrificing endurance it
01:20:50.34 --> 01:20:53.86 counts for nothing if they're untidy.
01:20:53.86 --> 01:20:59.30 The first morning no matter what are the weather conditions we hold an inspection.
01:20:59.30 --> 01:21:06.26 Every man has to show up with his chin-shaped hair cut, leather polished and button shining.
01:21:06.26 --> 01:21:12.14 If he doesn't, he gets hell.
01:21:12.14 --> 01:21:17.82 So I mean clearly we've talked about this since day one, the discipline and maintaining
01:21:17.82 --> 01:21:18.82 the discipline.
01:21:18.82 --> 01:21:21.82 And here these guys coming off the front lines from the trenches.
01:21:21.82 --> 01:21:25.22 All right cool tomorrow morning we're having inspections of get your deer together
01:21:25.22 --> 01:21:28.98 and polish your boots.
01:21:28.98 --> 01:21:30.34 Back to the book, there's a lot in it.
01:21:30.34 --> 01:21:35.66 You bring a man out from a tight corner where he's been an hourly contact with death.
01:21:35.66 --> 01:21:38.62 He's apt to think what's the use in taking pride of myself.
01:21:38.62 --> 01:21:42.26 I'm likely to be done in any day.
01:21:42.26 --> 01:21:45.18 It'll all be the same if I'm dead.
01:21:45.18 --> 01:21:51.90 But if he doesn't keep clean in his body he won't keep clean in his mind.
01:21:51.90 --> 01:21:57.10 The man who has his button shining brightly in his leather polished is usually the man who
01:21:57.10 --> 01:22:01.18 is brightly polished on the inside.
01:22:01.18 --> 01:22:05.74 And polish teaches a man to come out of the trenches from seeing his palettes killed and
01:22:05.74 --> 01:22:10.50 carry on as though nothing abnormal had happened.
01:22:10.50 --> 01:22:18.02 It educates him in an impersonal attitude towards calamity which makes it bearable.
01:22:18.02 --> 01:22:23.50 It forces him not to regard anything too tragically.
01:22:23.50 --> 01:22:29.82 If you can stand aside from yourself and poke fun at your own tragedy, and tragedy always
01:22:29.82 --> 01:22:32.66 has its humors aspects.
01:22:32.66 --> 01:22:37.26 That helps.
01:22:37.26 --> 01:22:40.46 We were sometimes we were in the som for several months.
01:22:40.46 --> 01:22:43.30 The mud was up to our knees almost all the time.
01:22:43.30 --> 01:22:46.10 We were perishingly cold and very rarely dry.
01:22:46.10 --> 01:22:47.66 There was no natural cover.
01:22:47.66 --> 01:22:51.82 When we went up forward to observe we would stand in water to our knees for 24 hours
01:22:51.82 --> 01:22:54.22 rather than going to the dugouts.
01:22:54.22 --> 01:22:58.46 They were so filled with vermin and batten flies.
01:22:58.46 --> 01:23:02.42 Even if we were wounded and strayed man often drowned on their buck journey back from
01:23:02.42 --> 01:23:06.90 the front line, many of the dead never got buried lives couldn't be rescued in carrying
01:23:06.90 --> 01:23:08.70 them out.
01:23:08.70 --> 01:23:14.38 We were so weary that the sight of those who rested forever only stirred in us a quiet
01:23:14.38 --> 01:23:17.38 envy.
01:23:17.38 --> 01:23:20.34 Our emotions were too exhausted for hatred.
01:23:20.34 --> 01:23:26.10 They usually are unless some new hunishness had roused them.
01:23:26.10 --> 01:23:31.50 When we were having a bad time, we'd glance across no man's land and say poor old fritzy,
01:23:31.50 --> 01:23:34.26 he's getting the worst of it.
01:23:34.26 --> 01:23:39.06 That thought helps.
01:23:39.06 --> 01:23:44.38 This is a piece where he talks about when somebody's not holding the line, when somebody's
01:23:44.38 --> 01:23:47.50 a quitter.
01:23:47.50 --> 01:23:52.54 When you come to consider it, a quitter is always a selfish man.
01:23:52.54 --> 01:23:57.58 A selfishness that makes a man a coward or a deserter, if he's in a dangerous place and runs
01:23:57.58 --> 01:24:06.70 away, all he's doing is thinking of himself.
01:24:06.70 --> 01:24:12.78 He goes on to say, here, I've been supposed to have been talking about God as we see him.
01:24:12.78 --> 01:24:14.78 I don't know whether I have.
01:24:14.78 --> 01:24:18.90 As a matter of fact, if you ask me when I was out there, whether there was any religion
01:24:18.90 --> 01:24:24.90 in the trenches, I should have replied certainly not.
01:24:24.90 --> 01:24:29.38 Now that I've been out of the fighting for a while, I see that there is religion there,
01:24:29.38 --> 01:24:34.90 a religion which will dominate the world when the war has ended, the religion of heroism.
01:24:34.90 --> 01:24:39.86 It's a religion in which men don't pray much.
01:24:39.86 --> 01:24:44.42 With me before I went to the front, prayer was a habit.
01:24:44.42 --> 01:24:47.62 Out there, I lost the habit.
01:24:47.62 --> 01:24:52.06 Not one was doing seemed sufficient.
01:24:52.06 --> 01:24:57.58 I got the feeling that I might be meeting God at any moment, so I didn't need to be worrying
01:24:57.58 --> 01:25:04.46 him all the time, hanging on to spiritual telephone and feeling slidied if he didn't answer
01:25:04.46 --> 01:25:08.02 me directly when I rang him up.
01:25:08.02 --> 01:25:12.26 If God was really interested in me, he didn't need constant reminding.
01:25:12.26 --> 01:25:20.42 When he had a world to manage, it seemed best not to interrupt him with fearless petitions,
01:25:20.42 --> 01:25:25.62 but to put my prayers into my work.
01:25:25.62 --> 01:25:29.62 That's how we all feel out there.
01:25:29.62 --> 01:25:35.46 I've learnt discipline and my own total unimportant.
01:25:35.46 --> 01:25:41.46 In the army discipline gets possession of your soul, you learn to suppress yourself
01:25:41.46 --> 01:25:45.86 to obey implicitly to think of others before yourself.
01:25:45.86 --> 01:25:51.30 You learn to jump at an order to forsake your own convenience at any hour of the day or
01:25:51.30 --> 01:25:57.86 night to go forward on the most lonely and dangerous errands without complaining.
01:25:57.86 --> 01:26:03.62 You learn to feel that there is only one thing that counts in life and only one thing
01:26:03.62 --> 01:26:05.54 you can make out of it.
01:26:05.54 --> 01:26:12.10 The spirit you have developed in encountering difficulties.
01:26:12.10 --> 01:26:14.58 Your body is nothing.
01:26:14.58 --> 01:26:19.30 It can be smashed in a minute how frail it is you never realize until you've seen men
01:26:19.30 --> 01:26:27.26 smashed, so you learn to tolerate the body, to despise death and to place all your alliance
01:26:27.26 --> 01:26:29.70 on courage.
01:26:29.70 --> 01:26:47.06 Which when is found at its best is the power to endure for the sake of others.
01:26:47.06 --> 01:26:54.42 It is closing out here.
01:26:54.42 --> 01:27:02.26 The religion of the trenches is not a religion which analyzes God with in-pertoned speculation.
01:27:02.26 --> 01:27:09.42 So in this religion the trenches God is not standing in some kind of a foritary judgment.
01:27:09.42 --> 01:27:14.22 It isn't a religion which takes up much of his time.
01:27:14.22 --> 01:27:21.38 It's a religion which teaches men to carry on stoutly and to say, I've tried to do my bit
01:27:21.38 --> 01:27:27.46 as best I know how.
01:27:27.46 --> 01:27:31.90 That's the simple religion of the trenches as I have learned it.
01:27:31.90 --> 01:27:35.78 A religion not without glory.
01:27:35.78 --> 01:27:46.10 To carry on as bravely as you know how and to trust God without worrying him.
01:27:46.10 --> 01:27:54.90 And the last line I'll read from the glory of the trenches, Dawson says, it's funny.
01:27:54.90 --> 01:28:03.22 You go away to the most damnable undertaking ever invented.
01:28:03.22 --> 01:28:16.06 And you come back cleaner in spirit.
01:28:16.06 --> 01:28:24.82 And again I will tell you that from my perspective and from what I've been through
01:28:24.82 --> 01:28:31.42 which by the way, I want to say that what I've been through in my military career is absolutely
01:28:31.42 --> 01:28:33.62 nothing.
01:28:33.62 --> 01:28:39.18 Nothing compared to what a soldier in the world were one lived through.
01:28:39.18 --> 01:28:41.66 But what I did go through, I will say this.
01:28:41.66 --> 01:28:53.42 I don't think war took anything away from me or impacted me in a negative way.
01:28:53.42 --> 01:28:59.66 I think war made me better.
01:28:59.66 --> 01:29:06.78 I think war made me a better man, a better person.
01:29:06.78 --> 01:29:10.50 And in the words of Dawson,
01:29:10.50 --> 01:29:19.30 I think it absolutely cleaned my spirit.
01:29:19.30 --> 01:29:26.10 And I am thankful for that.
01:29:26.10 --> 01:29:34.94 And I guess that the question becomes how can we clean our spirits without war?
01:29:34.94 --> 01:29:35.94 How can we do that?
01:29:35.94 --> 01:29:43.06 And I think the answer again, and this is something that I don't think is that it comes
01:29:43.06 --> 01:29:44.06 from discipline.
01:29:44.06 --> 01:29:46.10 And that's what I talk about all the time.
01:29:46.10 --> 01:29:51.94 It's about setting aside comfort, setting aside weakness, setting aside fear, and having
01:29:51.94 --> 01:29:56.94 the discipline to endure.
01:29:56.94 --> 01:30:10.78 And the challenges in the hardship and the pain in order to become better.
01:30:10.78 --> 01:30:28.90 To suffer the glory of the discipline, to become stronger and faster and smarter and better.
01:30:28.90 --> 01:30:40.74 And now from a leadership perspective is to then put others before yourself.
01:30:40.74 --> 01:30:48.82 The try and do some good in the world for others to lead them down the right path, not
01:30:48.82 --> 01:30:52.70 for you.
01:30:52.70 --> 01:30:57.06 But for them.
01:30:57.06 --> 01:31:05.38 And while war certainly taught me those things and ingrained those things into my mind
01:31:05.38 --> 01:31:10.58 if they weren't already there, I don't think you need to go to war.
01:31:10.58 --> 01:31:20.10 But I do think that you have to discipline yourself.
01:31:20.10 --> 01:31:24.54 You have to get outside your comfort zone and you have to push yourself beyond what you
01:31:24.54 --> 01:31:27.70 thought you could ever do.
01:31:27.70 --> 01:31:57.06 To get that glimpse of the truth and to get that glimpse of the glory in the trenches.
01:31:57.06 --> 01:32:11.82 And again, thanks to Jesse for sending me this book, Outstanding Old Copy Printed in 1918.
01:32:11.82 --> 01:32:18.94 I actually typed it all out so I didn't have to mess up this beautiful book.
01:32:18.94 --> 01:32:20.78 I learned a lot from it.
01:32:20.78 --> 01:32:23.42 So I appreciate it.
01:32:23.42 --> 01:32:28.86 And echo Charles.
01:32:28.86 --> 01:32:33.50 Save me and talk.
01:32:33.50 --> 01:32:37.14 Talk about something more like for instance.
01:32:37.14 --> 01:32:42.58 But like for instance, people just listen to this and maybe they want to listen to more
01:32:42.58 --> 01:32:43.58 of it.
01:32:43.58 --> 01:32:46.14 How could they help that occur in the world?
01:32:46.14 --> 01:32:48.54 Move that process along.
01:32:48.54 --> 01:32:53.06 We could just talk about Jockel White T for like 10 minutes.
01:32:53.06 --> 01:32:54.30 We could definitely talk about Jockel White T.
01:32:54.30 --> 01:32:57.30 I wasn't really that into, actually I was.
01:32:57.30 --> 01:32:59.10 I'm into T every once in a while.
01:32:59.10 --> 01:33:03.06 I can hear you say a lot of the T from the offices now missing.
01:33:03.06 --> 01:33:07.06 But you know how like you're like, you know, it's a mellow night.
01:33:07.06 --> 01:33:10.34 I should just call it and go to bed or something.
01:33:10.34 --> 01:33:13.74 Then I'd make like, you know what's the mellow one?
01:33:13.74 --> 01:33:14.74 Can't remember.
01:33:14.74 --> 01:33:15.74 Whatever.
01:33:15.74 --> 01:33:18.26 Yeah, I'm not into T like I said.
01:33:18.26 --> 01:33:21.58 So I was like, all right, well hey, you know, Jockel T.
01:33:21.58 --> 01:33:23.22 It's cool.
01:33:23.22 --> 01:33:24.22 I'm cool.
01:33:24.22 --> 01:33:25.22 Yeah.
01:33:25.22 --> 01:33:26.22 How's that working out?
01:33:26.22 --> 01:33:27.22 It's not going to say.
01:33:27.22 --> 01:33:29.62 No, it's like a random Saturday.
01:33:29.62 --> 01:33:34.70 And I was like, I'm going to do like how you do put it on ice and see if I can't get my
01:33:34.70 --> 01:33:37.42 refresh on, you know, outside it, whatever.
01:33:37.42 --> 01:33:39.70 And so I put it in.
01:33:39.70 --> 01:33:40.90 I put in this tin collo.
01:33:40.90 --> 01:33:41.90 Nice man.
01:33:41.90 --> 01:33:44.70 I was like, oh, I think I might be into T a little bit.
01:33:44.70 --> 01:33:45.70 Sarah comes out.
01:33:45.70 --> 01:33:46.70 She has hers too.
01:33:46.70 --> 01:33:47.70 It was nice.
01:33:47.70 --> 01:33:48.70 It was cool man.
01:33:48.70 --> 01:33:51.30 We are going through it very quickly because they're, well, I hope I am
01:33:51.30 --> 01:33:52.30 always getting after it right now.
01:33:52.30 --> 01:33:55.86 This is my younger kids.
01:33:55.86 --> 01:33:57.86 But yeah, and you know what's awesome?
01:33:57.86 --> 01:34:04.34 I don't know if you've gone to Amazon.com and read the reviews that people are writing.
01:34:04.34 --> 01:34:09.42 I'm actually going to have to bring out some of those and read them because they're awesome.
01:34:09.42 --> 01:34:12.62 They're funny as hell and they're great.
01:34:12.62 --> 01:34:18.18 So everyone that's writing reviews for Jockel T, Jockel White T, I appreciate it.
01:34:18.18 --> 01:34:19.18 It's awesome.
01:34:19.18 --> 01:34:25.10 Got a lot of good feedback as well about, you know, everyone likes it tastes great.
01:34:25.10 --> 01:34:27.82 And it makes you feel real good.
01:34:27.82 --> 01:34:32.92 It makes you feel, it's a little glory, a little glory in a cup, little glory in a
01:34:32.92 --> 01:34:33.92 iced tea.
01:34:33.92 --> 01:34:36.94 So I was looking over like the instructions.
01:34:36.94 --> 01:34:41.26 So let me just in case you don't read the instructions, I think they're pretty straightforward.
01:34:41.26 --> 01:34:43.06 I think you've ever had tea.
01:34:43.06 --> 01:34:44.06 Yeah.
01:34:44.06 --> 01:34:45.06 People know.
01:34:45.06 --> 01:34:48.62 But if you took the time to read the instructions, this is what you would read.
01:34:48.62 --> 01:34:49.62 So you can read the instructions.
01:34:49.62 --> 01:34:54.46 Boyle eight out of the water, pour water over one bag of Jockel White T, proof for three
01:34:54.46 --> 01:34:55.86 to five minutes.
01:34:55.86 --> 01:35:00.26 Enjoy over or enjoy hot or over ice.
01:35:00.26 --> 01:35:01.26 Get after it.
01:35:01.26 --> 01:35:05.66 So get after it is part of the instructions.
01:35:05.66 --> 01:35:08.86 In what's funny is people are, it's real.
01:35:08.86 --> 01:35:13.62 Like you really, you really have to get after it when you're done.
01:35:13.62 --> 01:35:17.14 And so that's what the funny is people are saying.
01:35:17.14 --> 01:35:18.14 It's real.
01:35:18.14 --> 01:35:19.14 It's real.
01:35:19.14 --> 01:35:21.14 There's real stuff in there.
01:35:21.14 --> 01:35:24.80 And when you get it in your brain, you'll be like, oh, I'm going to go knock out some
01:35:24.80 --> 01:35:25.80 projects.
01:35:25.80 --> 01:35:26.80 Maybe do a little MacCon.
01:35:26.80 --> 01:35:27.80 Maybe go on the Mac.
01:35:27.80 --> 01:35:28.80 Whatever.
01:35:28.80 --> 01:35:29.80 You know, it's just good.
01:35:29.80 --> 01:35:32.20 Or am I just cruise by the pool?
01:35:32.20 --> 01:35:34.20 No, we don't do that.
01:35:34.20 --> 01:35:35.20 That's not getting out of it.
01:35:35.20 --> 01:35:37.20 That makes one of us.
01:35:37.20 --> 01:35:39.000 I was getting after it in the pool.
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000 How about that?
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000 I guess I year approved.
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.60 Yeah, not it's good man.
01:35:42.60 --> 01:35:48.12 Like I said, it may be even more into tea because it's like, you know, it's like
01:35:48.12 --> 01:35:50.66 you get into, well, I did.
01:35:50.66 --> 01:35:52.46 I'm not going to say, this is what happens.
01:35:52.46 --> 01:35:54.54 But I'm saying, you're like, okay, I like this tea.
01:35:54.54 --> 01:35:56.14 I like the brand, you know?
01:35:56.14 --> 01:35:59.64 So you're, and then you appreciate the experience when it goes down.
01:35:59.64 --> 01:36:01.10 You know, you're more familiar with it now.
01:36:01.10 --> 01:36:02.34 Now I want to see people drinking tea.
01:36:02.34 --> 01:36:03.34 I'm like, yeah, yeah.
01:36:03.34 --> 01:36:07.54 And some people been like, whoa, some people emailed and said, whoa, is it really
01:36:07.54 --> 01:36:09.14 like, jocquo, you made this tea?
01:36:09.14 --> 01:36:10.14 I'm really.
01:36:10.14 --> 01:36:11.14 Yeah, yeah.
01:36:11.14 --> 01:36:13.34 I went through, it took like, it took a few months to make.
01:36:13.34 --> 01:36:16.10 Cause I kind of, I'd send back, oh, no, make it a little bit more this.
01:36:16.10 --> 01:36:17.10 A little bit less of that.
01:36:17.10 --> 01:36:23.02 And eventually, when I got the, the right combination thing, then it was okay.
01:36:23.02 --> 01:36:25.74 And, well, they're like, okay, well, for marketing, what do you want to do?
01:36:25.74 --> 01:36:27.62 And I go, oh, it's, oh, here's the marketing.
01:36:27.62 --> 01:36:29.30 I'm, I'm Mr. Marketing over here.
01:36:29.30 --> 01:36:31.10 Put it in a black box.
01:36:31.10 --> 01:36:32.62 Oh, what should we call it?
01:36:32.62 --> 01:36:34.26 Oh, I think of a good original title.
01:36:34.26 --> 01:36:35.26 Jocquo tea.
01:36:35.26 --> 01:36:36.26 How's that?
01:36:36.26 --> 01:36:37.50 Okay, so we got Jocquo tea.
01:36:37.50 --> 01:36:38.50 Good.
01:36:38.50 --> 01:36:39.50 There it is.
01:36:39.50 --> 01:36:41.10 And that's my marketing strategy.
01:36:41.10 --> 01:36:44.10 Hey, hey.
01:36:44.10 --> 01:36:45.10 Yeah, man.
01:36:45.10 --> 01:36:46.10 No, I like it.
01:36:46.10 --> 01:36:50.10 I actually did a very high-ranking company to come in and do an assessment of our customers.
01:36:50.10 --> 01:36:51.10 Guess what?
01:36:51.10 --> 01:36:53.82 Our customers are out to kick ass.
01:36:53.82 --> 01:36:55.98 They don't want all this crap.
01:36:55.98 --> 01:36:59.26 They want something that's going to make them crush the world.
01:36:59.26 --> 01:37:00.26 Yeah.
01:37:00.26 --> 01:37:01.26 So, there you go.
01:37:01.26 --> 01:37:05.06 We don't need to put any, you know, images of whatever on it.
01:37:05.06 --> 01:37:10.02 Yeah, doing some kind of demographic studies on what can interest and, you know, who's
01:37:10.02 --> 01:37:11.66 the target market, the target market?
01:37:11.66 --> 01:37:12.66 I don't care.
01:37:12.66 --> 01:37:14.78 I know the target market is.
01:37:14.78 --> 01:37:17.98 The target market is my people out there that are getting after it.
01:37:17.98 --> 01:37:18.98 There's the target market.
01:37:18.98 --> 01:37:19.98 You know, there you go.
01:37:19.98 --> 01:37:20.98 I just hope I can get it.
01:37:20.98 --> 01:37:25.54 I just thought I hope this doesn't fall into the wrong ants.
01:37:25.54 --> 01:37:30.70 What if criminal, criminally-minded people or people that are, you know, have evil thoughts?
01:37:30.70 --> 01:37:32.42 Maybe they start drinking white tea.
01:37:32.42 --> 01:37:33.42 We might be in trouble.
01:37:33.42 --> 01:37:34.42 Yeah.
01:37:34.42 --> 01:37:36.82 We might have to bolster up and drink more white tea.
01:37:36.82 --> 01:37:40.90 Yeah, or they could switch over to the old discipline equals freedom, kind of situation.
01:37:40.90 --> 01:37:43.90 And, you know, I'm just saying, theoretically, that could be something.
01:37:43.90 --> 01:37:44.74 Yeah.
01:37:44.74 --> 01:37:45.74 They're good.
01:37:45.74 --> 01:37:46.74 This is good, man.
01:37:46.74 --> 01:37:47.74 It looks good.
01:37:47.74 --> 01:37:48.74 Yep.
01:37:48.74 --> 01:37:49.74 Pretty good.
01:37:49.74 --> 01:37:50.74 Pretty good.
01:37:50.74 --> 01:37:51.74 All right.
01:37:51.74 --> 01:37:52.74 Cool.
01:37:52.74 --> 01:37:53.74 Jocco-white tea.
01:37:53.74 --> 01:37:54.74 You know what?
01:37:54.74 --> 01:37:54.74 On Amazon.com.
01:37:54.74 --> 01:37:56.74 After you click through, click through.
01:37:56.74 --> 01:37:57.74 Yeah.
01:37:57.74 --> 01:38:00.74 Which, you know, there's a whole tail behind the click through right now.
01:38:00.74 --> 01:38:01.74 Yeah.
01:38:01.74 --> 01:38:02.74 Yeah.
01:38:02.74 --> 01:38:05.94 It's kind of, and we have to make sure, because that's one of the main ways to support
01:38:05.94 --> 01:38:08.14 the podcast, is to click through.
01:38:08.14 --> 01:38:12.90 But if in the past you saved, first of all, if you had the true, the true, the true
01:38:12.90 --> 01:38:14.90 is no-in-void.
01:38:14.90 --> 01:38:15.90 We got shut down by Amazon.
01:38:15.90 --> 01:38:17.90 It was, let's just say they didn't really like it that much.
01:38:17.90 --> 01:38:21.66 They didn't like that much, because I've been proven wrong in the world.
01:38:21.66 --> 01:38:23.34 This is one of the times I've been wrong.
01:38:23.34 --> 01:38:25.90 There is such a thing as getting after it too much.
01:38:25.90 --> 01:38:26.90 Yeah.
01:38:26.90 --> 01:38:27.90 And apparently we were getting after it.
01:38:27.90 --> 01:38:30.70 Troopers were getting after it too much with the true, but tool.
01:38:30.70 --> 01:38:32.30 So they shut down the true, but tool.
01:38:32.30 --> 01:38:33.30 Okay.
01:38:33.30 --> 01:38:35.10 So if you're still having the true, I don't know if it's still work.
01:38:35.10 --> 01:38:37.02 But if you're still having it, you think you're using it.
01:38:37.02 --> 01:38:39.30 You're not supporting the podcast.
01:38:39.30 --> 01:38:40.30 So what you have to do.
01:38:40.30 --> 01:38:47.42 And also if you have your old link saved that would click you into Amazon.
01:38:47.42 --> 01:38:48.42 And you thought, oh, I just used this.
01:38:48.42 --> 01:38:50.38 And I'll just save the, what's that called a favorite?
01:38:50.38 --> 01:38:51.38 If you made it a favorite part of it.
01:38:51.38 --> 01:38:56.18 Before, if you bookmarked it, then you got to erase that bookmark.
01:38:56.18 --> 01:39:00.54 You got to go back to jockelpodcast.com or back to jockelstore.com.
01:39:00.54 --> 01:39:05.50 And you've got to make a new bookmark that has the new click through the Amazon.
01:39:05.50 --> 01:39:09.30 So we can get Amazon back in the game supporting the podcast.
01:39:09.30 --> 01:39:11.10 So again, it's not costing you anything.
01:39:11.10 --> 01:39:14.06 All it's going to cost you is that short period of time to click through.
01:39:14.06 --> 01:39:15.54 And that way we can support the podcast.
01:39:15.54 --> 01:39:19.02 That way we can buy more knives for the table.
01:39:19.02 --> 01:39:20.02 Yep.
01:39:20.02 --> 01:39:21.66 And that's what we're looking to do.
01:39:21.66 --> 01:39:22.66 Yeah.
01:39:22.66 --> 01:39:23.50 And Amazon's not mad at us.
01:39:23.50 --> 01:39:25.66 They were just like, hey, the true, true, true, true.
01:39:25.66 --> 01:39:26.66 Too heavy.
01:39:26.66 --> 01:39:27.66 It's too heavy.
01:39:27.66 --> 01:39:28.66 Mm-hmm.
01:39:28.66 --> 01:39:32.54 It's like when, what was that book we just did where the Germans were mad.
01:39:32.54 --> 01:39:34.86 The Americans were getting after too much.
01:39:34.86 --> 01:39:35.86 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:39:35.86 --> 01:39:36.86 This is unethical.
01:39:36.86 --> 01:39:42.58 Like theoretically from Amazon's perspective, like the Nazis, they thought, man,
01:39:42.58 --> 01:39:43.98 these guys are getting after this.
01:39:43.98 --> 01:39:44.98 Too much.
01:39:44.98 --> 01:39:46.82 This true, true, true thing is, we must arrest.
01:39:46.82 --> 01:39:58.06 So there's no more true bookmark from from jockelpodcast.com or from the jockelstore.com.
01:39:58.06 --> 01:39:59.06 All right.
01:39:59.06 --> 01:40:00.06 So that's good.
01:40:00.06 --> 01:40:02.70 That was a really good analogy right there by the way.
01:40:02.70 --> 01:40:03.70 The Nazis.
01:40:03.70 --> 01:40:04.70 Yeah.
01:40:04.70 --> 01:40:05.70 It's good.
01:40:05.70 --> 01:40:06.70 I'm not trying to say,
01:40:06.70 --> 01:40:08.98 it was fascist in what Amazon did.
01:40:08.98 --> 01:40:10.30 No, because it wasn't.
01:40:10.30 --> 01:40:11.30 You know what?
01:40:11.30 --> 01:40:14.22 It's a great, it actually really is truly a great program.
01:40:14.22 --> 01:40:14.58 Yeah.
01:40:14.58 --> 01:40:15.58 It really is a great program.
01:40:15.58 --> 01:40:17.62 It's very supportive of us.
01:40:17.62 --> 01:40:20.30 And it's cool for Amazon because people are ordering stuff through Amazon.
01:40:20.30 --> 01:40:25.46 I love it by and stuff and doing it through our website makes me feel good.
01:40:25.46 --> 01:40:28.62 It's like another excuse to just buy more books.
01:40:28.62 --> 01:40:30.94 I'm buying books at a ridiculous rate right now.
01:40:30.94 --> 01:40:32.94 It's actually, it's almost embarrassing.
01:40:32.94 --> 01:40:34.34 How many books I'm buying right now?
01:40:34.34 --> 01:40:36.38 Because everybody recommends me a book.
01:40:36.38 --> 01:40:38.06 And I used to say, well, maybe I'll take a look at it.
01:40:38.06 --> 01:40:38.90 I don't have time to do that anymore.
01:40:38.90 --> 01:40:39.90 Now I just order it.
01:40:39.90 --> 01:40:41.18 Just bring it to me.
01:40:41.18 --> 01:40:41.90 Amazon.
01:40:41.90 --> 01:40:42.90 I want it today.
01:40:42.90 --> 01:40:43.90 Yeah.
01:40:43.90 --> 01:40:44.90 Yeah.
01:40:44.90 --> 01:40:45.90 How cool is that?
01:40:45.90 --> 01:40:46.90 Yeah.
01:40:46.90 --> 01:40:47.90 Amazon Prime.
01:40:47.90 --> 01:40:48.90 Same day delivery.
01:40:48.90 --> 01:40:49.90 Bring me my books.
01:40:49.90 --> 01:40:50.90 Yeah.
01:40:50.90 --> 01:40:51.90 You know what else is cool?
01:40:51.90 --> 01:40:56.14 So I was going to mark up the book, the glory of the trenches.
01:40:56.14 --> 01:40:59.14 But I didn't want to mark it up obviously because it's an old beautiful copy.
01:40:59.14 --> 01:41:00.94 So I bought a new one.
01:41:00.94 --> 01:41:01.94 Okay.
01:41:01.94 --> 01:41:06.18 Now when you buy these certain books from Amazon,
01:41:06.18 --> 01:41:08.26 they print them immediately.
01:41:08.26 --> 01:41:09.26 All right.
01:41:09.26 --> 01:41:13.14 So this book has got printed on the 22nd of September for me.
01:41:13.14 --> 01:41:13.98 And then I just ordered it.
01:41:13.98 --> 01:41:15.58 So I could mark this one up.
01:41:15.58 --> 01:41:16.58 Yeah.
01:41:16.58 --> 01:41:17.94 It didn't arrive before I went on my trip.
01:41:17.94 --> 01:41:20.10 So I did it on another copy.
01:41:20.10 --> 01:41:21.10 So anyways.
01:41:21.10 --> 01:41:22.10 Yeah.
01:41:22.10 --> 01:41:25.58 They will print a lot of these books that we're bringing out, that are rare books, that
01:41:25.58 --> 01:41:26.98 are old books, that are out of print books.
01:41:26.98 --> 01:41:27.98 They just reprint them.
01:41:27.98 --> 01:41:28.98 Yeah.
01:41:28.98 --> 01:41:30.38 So you can get a book printed.
01:41:30.38 --> 01:41:34.98 They'll bring the ones out here on the West Coast are printed in San Bernardino, California,
01:41:34.98 --> 01:41:35.98 San Bernardino.
01:41:35.98 --> 01:41:36.98 There you go.
01:41:36.98 --> 01:41:37.98 And what?
01:41:37.98 --> 01:41:38.98 You order it.
01:41:38.98 --> 01:41:39.98 They drive it down that day.
01:41:39.98 --> 01:41:40.98 Oh, yeah.
01:41:40.98 --> 01:41:41.98 I don't know what, man.
01:41:41.98 --> 01:41:42.98 I don't know.
01:41:42.98 --> 01:41:43.98 It's awesome.
01:41:43.98 --> 01:41:44.98 Yeah.
01:41:44.98 --> 01:41:45.98 Cool.
01:41:45.98 --> 01:41:46.98 But yeah.
01:41:46.98 --> 01:41:48.98 If you want to support this podcast in that way.
01:41:48.98 --> 01:41:49.98 Which is a great way.
01:41:49.98 --> 01:41:51.98 And we really appreciate it.
01:41:51.98 --> 01:41:52.98 That's awesome stuff.
01:41:52.98 --> 01:41:55.98 It definitely helps us do what we do.
01:41:55.98 --> 01:41:56.98 Yeah.
01:41:56.98 --> 01:41:57.98 Yeah.
01:41:57.98 --> 01:41:58.98 Thanks.
01:41:58.98 --> 01:41:59.98 But yeah.
01:41:59.98 --> 01:42:02.98 It's on jockelstore.com and jockelpikets.com.
01:42:02.98 --> 01:42:04.98 Click through.
01:42:04.98 --> 01:42:07.98 What other ways can people support this podcast?
01:42:07.98 --> 01:42:14.98 Well, obviously, the obvious way is subscribe to it on iTunes.
01:42:14.98 --> 01:42:15.98 Right?
01:42:15.98 --> 01:42:16.98 If you haven't already.
01:42:16.98 --> 01:42:18.98 And also the YouTube.
01:42:18.98 --> 01:42:20.98 Again, and I say this all the time.
01:42:20.98 --> 01:42:22.98 I'm putting more videos on there.
01:42:22.98 --> 01:42:24.98 It's cool because I'll put little excerpts.
01:42:24.98 --> 01:42:30.98 You know, where, because people on Twitter and stuff, they'll be like, hey, can you just isolate this one?
01:42:30.98 --> 01:42:35.98 Sure.
01:42:35.98 --> 01:42:37.98 Or they'll be like, hey, release this excerpt.
01:42:37.98 --> 01:42:39.98 I want to make a video.
01:42:39.98 --> 01:42:42.98 You can get the videos from YouTube and stuff.
01:42:42.98 --> 01:42:44.98 So they'll be like, hey, episode, I don't know, 40.
01:42:44.98 --> 01:42:46.98 You know, the last closing thing.
01:42:46.98 --> 01:42:54.98 Anyway, so I'll put stuff, not just excerpts, but other videos other than the whole episode of the podcast.
01:42:54.98 --> 01:42:58.98 And when a lot of times when you do those, sometimes they're just excerpts.
01:42:58.98 --> 01:43:01.98 But sometimes there's other things happening in those.
01:43:01.98 --> 01:43:02.98 Thanks, sure.
01:43:02.98 --> 01:43:03.98 Sure.
01:43:03.98 --> 01:43:05.98 I mean, sometimes you make full new video.
01:43:05.98 --> 01:43:09.98 Like the good video where does this come from?
01:43:09.98 --> 01:43:10.98 Yes, yes.
01:43:10.98 --> 01:43:15.98 And I think just as I'll speak for the voice of everyone else, myself included and everyone else,
01:43:15.98 --> 01:43:17.98 that's the thing, this podcast, that's not named echo.
01:43:17.98 --> 01:43:20.98 I think we all want to see more videos.
01:43:20.98 --> 01:43:21.98 That's me.
01:43:21.98 --> 01:43:25.98 And I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to make that hint to you.
01:43:25.98 --> 01:43:26.98 I think I'm making it to you all while.
01:43:26.98 --> 01:43:28.98 I know it's hard work.
01:43:28.98 --> 01:43:29.98 Yeah, you.
01:43:29.98 --> 01:43:34.98 But you know, we're just trying to let you know, we hear on, you know, the listeners and the,
01:43:34.98 --> 01:43:37.98 and the troopers here, we all want to see a little bit more activity.
01:43:37.98 --> 01:43:38.98 Yep.
01:43:38.98 --> 01:43:42.98 And I think I personally think that the more people are subscribing to YouTube,
01:43:42.98 --> 01:43:45.98 the more motivated you're going to get.
01:43:45.98 --> 01:43:46.98 Yeah.
01:43:46.98 --> 01:43:47.98 Yeah.
01:43:47.98 --> 01:43:48.98 I hate to say relying on motivation.
01:43:48.98 --> 01:43:49.98 No, no, no.
01:43:49.98 --> 01:43:51.98 Because I know, I rely on a discipline.
01:43:51.98 --> 01:43:53.98 And I wish you were like, you know what, my discipline is.
01:43:53.98 --> 01:43:57.98 I'm making, you know, one video every two weeks, but I would see that kind of discipline.
01:43:57.98 --> 01:43:57.98 Yeah.
01:43:57.98 --> 01:43:58.98 Really?
01:43:58.98 --> 01:43:59.98 From the end.
01:43:59.98 --> 01:44:03.98 There you go.
01:44:03.98 --> 01:44:04.98 All right.
01:44:04.98 --> 01:44:05.98 Well, hey, we're one step closer.
01:44:05.98 --> 01:44:06.98 Yeah.
01:44:06.98 --> 01:44:08.98 And, you know, expect it.
01:44:08.98 --> 01:44:09.98 Maybe not.
01:44:09.98 --> 01:44:10.98 Today, maybe not tomorrow.
01:44:10.98 --> 01:44:11.98 But I'm on it.
01:44:11.98 --> 01:44:12.98 I'm on it.
01:44:12.98 --> 01:44:13.98 Oh, I like that.

01:44:19.98 --> 01:44:20.98 Deep on it.
01:44:20.98 --> 01:44:25.98 Um, okay. So on it, these supplements, we all know that.
01:44:25.98 --> 01:44:29.98 A lot of people, a lot of people don't think that I work out just because they don't see me.
01:44:29.98 --> 01:44:30.98 They hear my voice.
01:44:30.98 --> 01:44:32.98 So like, oh, I could obviously doesn't work out.
01:44:32.98 --> 01:44:34.98 But Jaco obviously works out.

01:44:57.98 --> 01:44:58.98 Not the strong bone.
01:44:58.98 --> 01:44:59.98 I set for the strong bone.

01:45:12.98 --> 01:45:13.98 We train today hard.
01:45:13.98 --> 01:45:15.98 I did not take shrimp tech today.
01:45:15.98 --> 01:45:18.98 And I didn't feel like I brought my egg in the way I wanted to.
01:45:18.98 --> 01:45:20.98 So it's too bad.
01:45:20.98 --> 01:45:21.98 Yeah.
01:45:21.98 --> 01:45:22.98 No, no.

01:45:23.98 --> 01:45:24.98 Yeah.
01:45:24.98 --> 01:45:29.98 But I felt like I was breathing harder.

01:45:59.98 --> 01:46:02.98 They some supplements rely on the placebo effect.
01:46:02.98 --> 01:46:04.98 Literally rely on that.
01:46:04.98 --> 01:46:06.98 Like that's its effectiveness.
01:46:06.98 --> 01:46:08.98 That's why it's effective because of police.
01:46:08.98 --> 01:46:10.98 Police, police, police, not on it.

01:46:38.98 --> 01:46:42.98 But now today is relative because when this podcast comes out,
01:46:42.98 --> 01:46:43.98 it won't be true.

01:47:06.98 --> 01:47:08.98 October 2nd.
01:47:08.98 --> 01:47:09.98 And one of the comments.
01:47:09.98 --> 01:47:11.98 I just read it.
01:47:11.98 --> 01:47:12.98 Little while ago.
01:47:12.98 --> 01:47:15.98 Um, it says, hey, where do I get that good shirt?
01:47:15.98 --> 01:47:17.98 Or where do I get a jockel shirt?
01:47:17.98 --> 01:47:18.98 Oh.
01:47:18.98 --> 01:47:20.98 That's an interesting question, right?
01:47:20.98 --> 01:47:21.98 Yeah.
01:47:21.98 --> 01:47:23.98 Because there's only one place in the world.
01:47:23.98 --> 01:47:24.98 You can get that.
01:47:24.98 --> 01:47:24.98 Yeah.
01:47:24.98 --> 01:47:25.98 And we say it a lot.
01:47:25.98 --> 01:47:28.98 But nonetheless, you know, it's obligated to listen to me talk about
01:47:28.98 --> 01:47:29.98 Jockel store.
01:47:29.98 --> 01:47:30.98 Yeah.
01:47:30.98 --> 01:47:31.98 Really?
01:47:31.98 --> 01:47:33.98 People fast forward when they get to you talking about stuff.
01:47:33.98 --> 01:47:34.98 I would not, I have not surprised.
01:47:34.98 --> 01:47:35.98 If people do, I'm not surprised.
01:47:35.98 --> 01:47:37.98 Are they missing some nuggets?
01:47:37.98 --> 01:47:38.98 They're missing some information.
01:47:38.98 --> 01:47:39.98 I think they're missing some information.
01:47:39.98 --> 01:47:41.98 I think they're missing some good times too.
01:47:41.98 --> 01:47:42.98 Yeah.
01:47:42.98 --> 01:47:43.98 Potentially, sure.
01:47:43.98 --> 01:47:44.98 Yes.
01:47:44.98 --> 01:47:48.98 So, how they're going to know it was B.C's birthday.
01:47:48.98 --> 01:47:49.98 To that to do?
01:47:49.98 --> 01:47:50.98 Yeah.
01:47:50.98 --> 01:47:51.98 That's the other way.
01:47:51.98 --> 01:47:52.98 Yeah.
01:47:52.98 --> 01:47:53.98 Great point.
01:47:53.98 --> 01:47:54.98 Yeah.
01:47:54.98 --> 01:47:59.98 So, I would say it's a little fast forward through these, but do what you like.
01:47:59.98 --> 01:48:02.98 You know, what if you're on your way to go do some pull-ups or something?
01:48:02.98 --> 01:48:04.98 And you're like, the books done.
01:48:04.98 --> 01:48:05.98 We're done with the book.
01:48:05.98 --> 01:48:06.98 Hmm.
01:48:06.98 --> 01:48:08.98 Time to do some pull-ups.
01:48:08.98 --> 01:48:09.98 Then that'd be cool.
01:48:09.98 --> 01:48:12.98 You know what's weird though when you listen to other podcasts?
01:48:12.98 --> 01:48:19.38 Well, specifically, if you listen to Joe Rogan's podcast, which I do, sometimes they're
01:48:19.38 --> 01:48:20.38 just straight talking.
01:48:20.38 --> 01:48:21.38 Yeah.
01:48:21.38 --> 01:48:24.70 Which is what we're doing right now.
01:48:24.70 --> 01:48:29.02 We are talking about it is enclosed around some subject matter, because we're talking
01:48:29.02 --> 01:48:32.30 about ways to support the podcast.
01:48:32.30 --> 01:48:35.70 So, yeah, but it's still like I said, there's some nuggets in there.
01:48:35.70 --> 01:48:36.70 Sure.
01:48:36.70 --> 01:48:37.70 That are important.
01:48:37.70 --> 01:48:38.70 Yeah.
01:48:38.70 --> 01:48:39.70 And even if they're not important.
01:48:39.70 --> 01:48:42.70 What's funny is even if they're not important.
01:48:42.70 --> 01:48:43.70 They're there.
01:48:43.70 --> 01:48:45.70 This is what I think is cool.
01:48:45.70 --> 01:48:50.10 When I go as I travel a lot and I've been traveling on and I'm starting to meet just
01:48:50.10 --> 01:48:53.70 like, troopers everywhere everywhere.
01:48:53.70 --> 01:48:58.82 I was all over the world all the way from New Zealand to East Coast up and down East
01:48:58.82 --> 01:48:59.82 Coast.
01:48:59.82 --> 01:49:01.70 I meet meet troopers everywhere.
01:49:01.70 --> 01:49:05.62 And when I meet people, all of a sudden, it's like, it's like friends that you have
01:49:05.62 --> 01:49:06.62 inside jokes with.
01:49:06.62 --> 01:49:07.62 Right.
01:49:07.62 --> 01:49:10.54 Yeah.
01:49:10.54 --> 01:49:11.54 Yeah.
01:49:11.54 --> 01:49:12.90 And then they make cracks about this and about that and it's all from the podcast.
01:49:12.90 --> 01:49:14.86 So that's kind of cool.
01:49:14.86 --> 01:49:19.34 It's not just hey, get on here and get educated about life leadership business.
01:49:19.34 --> 01:49:20.34 War.
01:49:20.34 --> 01:49:21.34 You know what?
01:49:21.34 --> 01:49:24.22 Let's have some inside jokes that we can laugh at each other.
01:49:24.22 --> 01:49:30.18 When I show up at, you know, you're whatever you work to do some work myself.
01:49:30.18 --> 01:49:31.18 Yeah.
01:49:31.18 --> 01:49:32.18 Yeah.
01:49:32.18 --> 01:49:33.82 People come to the gym and they'll tell me good evening.
01:49:33.82 --> 01:49:34.82 You never stayed that.
01:49:34.82 --> 01:49:35.82 Oh, you like good evening.
01:49:35.82 --> 01:49:40.82 At least a quarter of the reviews for Jocquay T.
01:49:40.82 --> 01:49:43.82 We start off with Good evening, I go.
01:49:43.82 --> 01:49:44.82 Yes.
01:49:44.82 --> 01:49:45.82 Good evening.
01:49:45.82 --> 01:49:50.82 I don't even know what started that.
01:49:50.82 --> 01:49:51.82 I mean, obviously, I said it.
01:49:51.82 --> 01:49:52.82 I think you started it.
01:49:52.82 --> 01:49:54.82 No, I absolutely started it.
01:49:54.82 --> 01:50:00.82 But, but at some point, I mean, I don't know how else to introduce you, right?
01:50:00.82 --> 01:50:02.82 Other than to say, Good evening.
01:50:02.82 --> 01:50:04.82 Yeah, you just kept, you sort of just kept doing it.
01:50:04.82 --> 01:50:05.82 Yeah.
01:50:05.82 --> 01:50:06.82 Yeah.
01:50:06.82 --> 01:50:09.82 And you, your response is now standard, too.
01:50:09.82 --> 01:50:11.82 Well, what else would you say, you know?
01:50:11.82 --> 01:50:12.82 I guess you don't can't say much.
01:50:12.82 --> 01:50:13.82 Good evening.
01:50:13.82 --> 01:50:14.82 Good evening.
01:50:14.82 --> 01:50:15.82 Amen.
01:50:15.82 --> 01:50:16.82 I like it.
01:50:16.82 --> 01:50:17.82 I like it.
01:50:17.82 --> 01:50:18.82 I'm going to stick with Good evening.
01:50:18.82 --> 01:50:19.82 I think I like that.
01:50:19.82 --> 01:50:20.82 There it is.
01:50:20.82 --> 01:50:24.82 But to answer that question, let's say someone else had that question.
01:50:24.82 --> 01:50:26.82 Where do I get a Jocquay shirt?
01:50:26.82 --> 01:50:29.82 I'll tell you where you get a Jocquay shirt.
01:50:29.82 --> 01:50:30.82 Jocquay store.
01:50:30.82 --> 01:50:32.82 That's again.
01:50:32.82 --> 01:50:34.82 Love the marketing on that.
01:50:34.82 --> 01:50:35.82 Yeah.
01:50:35.82 --> 01:50:36.82 We got Scott Cree.
01:50:36.82 --> 01:50:37.82 We got Scott Cree.
01:50:37.82 --> 01:50:39.82 It's a store from Jocquay.
01:50:39.82 --> 01:50:41.82 It's online.com.
01:50:41.82 --> 01:50:42.82 Jocquay store.com.
01:50:42.82 --> 01:50:45.82 Yes, we have shirts there.
01:50:45.82 --> 01:50:47.82 We have travel mugs.
01:50:47.82 --> 01:50:49.82 You know, the kind you bring with you.
01:50:49.82 --> 01:50:50.82 They're not the, the sh- Oh, this kind.
01:50:50.82 --> 01:50:52.82 You can put your Jocquay T shirt.
01:50:52.82 --> 01:50:53.82 Yep.
01:50:53.82 --> 01:50:55.82 If you choose to, yes, exactly.
01:50:55.82 --> 01:50:58.82 And some, some bumper stickers that are kind of cool.
01:50:58.82 --> 01:51:01.82 They're on Jocquay store.com as well.
01:51:01.82 --> 01:51:03.82 And this one of the sticks on there, cool.
01:51:03.82 --> 01:51:04.82 We have patches.
01:51:04.82 --> 01:51:06.82 Okay, here's the thing about the patch about patches.
01:51:06.82 --> 01:51:10.82 Someone online saying, hey, get the Velcro patches.
01:51:10.82 --> 01:51:13.82 And I'm just not as familiar with the Velcro patches.
01:51:13.82 --> 01:51:15.82 We already had these other two patches.
01:51:15.82 --> 01:51:16.82 One is the Jiu-Jitsu patch.
01:51:16.82 --> 01:51:19.82 The other one is the Jiu-Jitsu patch, but it's all purpose patch.
01:51:19.82 --> 01:51:21.82 You know, you can iron it on, but you sew it on.
01:51:21.82 --> 01:51:23.82 Four inches by three inches.
01:51:23.82 --> 01:51:25.82 The Velcro patch up like that's a good idea.
01:51:25.82 --> 01:51:26.82 The Velcro patch.
01:51:26.82 --> 01:51:28.82 Let me get the same thing for it's 4x3.
01:51:28.82 --> 01:51:30.82 It's a Velcro patch.
01:51:30.82 --> 01:51:31.82 So it's cool for that.
01:51:31.82 --> 01:51:35.82 But you explained to me, those Velcro patches are interchangeable.
01:51:35.82 --> 01:51:37.82 The standard is 3x2.
01:51:37.82 --> 01:51:38.82 Yeah.
01:51:38.82 --> 01:51:39.82 Three across.
01:51:39.82 --> 01:51:44.82 So just understand the Velcro patch currently right now is 4x3.
01:51:44.82 --> 01:51:45.82 Did you get 2x3 in order?
01:51:45.82 --> 01:51:46.82 Yeah.
01:51:46.82 --> 01:51:51.82 So I got to, you know, I didn't finalize it, but they come in pretty quick.
01:51:51.82 --> 01:51:54.82 So just know, just be aware of the dimensions of the patch.
01:51:54.82 --> 01:51:58.82 If you want to do the interchangeable one, I guess technically you could put the 4x3.
01:51:58.82 --> 01:52:00.82 But we're not doing that.
01:52:00.82 --> 01:52:01.82 I'll get the 2x3 and...
01:52:01.82 --> 01:52:02.82 Don't encourage that.
01:52:02.82 --> 01:52:03.82 Yeah.
01:52:03.82 --> 01:52:04.82 Please.
01:52:04.82 --> 01:52:05.82 Yeah.
01:52:05.82 --> 01:52:06.82 Please not to give it to me.
01:52:06.82 --> 01:52:07.82 Nonetheless.
01:52:07.82 --> 01:52:09.82 They're on Jocco Store as well.
01:52:09.82 --> 01:52:12.82 The Jitsu patches there too, like I said.
01:52:12.82 --> 01:52:15.82 Rash guards are there.
01:52:15.82 --> 01:52:16.82 Big time.
01:52:16.82 --> 01:52:18.82 All on the Jocco Store.
01:52:18.82 --> 01:52:19.82 Somewhere on that corner.
01:52:19.82 --> 01:52:21.82 But they're there in full effect for sure.
01:52:21.82 --> 01:52:23.82 And they're good.
01:52:23.82 --> 01:52:26.82 Five emails.
01:52:26.82 --> 01:52:30.82 Today, saying they felt the 19%.
01:52:30.82 --> 01:52:31.82 Yeah.
01:52:31.82 --> 01:52:32.82 They've been performing.
01:52:32.82 --> 01:52:33.82 Allegedly.
01:52:33.82 --> 01:52:35.82 There's no alleged about it.
01:52:35.82 --> 01:52:36.82 Yes.
01:52:36.82 --> 01:52:39.82 How can you say that's alleged when people are, I factually felt the difference.
01:52:39.82 --> 01:52:40.82 Oh well, that it's just what they're...
01:52:40.82 --> 01:52:41.82 What they're just skepticking on?
01:52:41.82 --> 01:52:42.82 No.
01:52:42.82 --> 01:52:43.82 It's what they said.
01:52:43.82 --> 01:52:44.82 I wasn't there to witness it.
01:52:44.82 --> 01:52:45.82 Oh no.
01:52:45.82 --> 01:52:47.82 But if you're saying to tell you that a 19% improvement if they did not...
01:52:47.82 --> 01:52:50.82 But they alleged it that it was an allegation.
01:52:50.82 --> 01:52:51.82 No.
01:52:51.82 --> 01:52:52.82 I don't support you all that.
01:52:52.82 --> 01:52:53.82 Technically.
01:52:53.82 --> 01:52:54.82 We're falling out of grace here, man.
01:52:54.82 --> 01:52:57.82 When somebody tells me they got 19% improvement with the rashguard.
01:52:57.82 --> 01:52:58.82 Top get his fat.
01:52:58.82 --> 01:52:59.82 Yeah.
01:52:59.82 --> 01:53:00.82 Yeah.
01:53:00.82 --> 01:53:01.82 I would be lied to you.
01:53:01.82 --> 01:53:03.82 Otherwise, if you say, hey, give me my money back.
01:53:03.82 --> 01:53:04.82 I didn't get a 19% improvement.
01:53:04.82 --> 01:53:04.82 Yeah.
01:53:04.82 --> 01:53:05.82 That's good.
01:53:05.82 --> 01:53:07.82 That's too very good points.
01:53:07.82 --> 01:53:10.82 And with women's tank tops.
01:53:10.82 --> 01:53:11.82 I understand.
01:53:11.82 --> 01:53:12.82 It's fall.
01:53:12.82 --> 01:53:14.82 We're going into winter soon.
01:53:14.82 --> 01:53:15.82 Tank tops.
01:53:17.82 --> 01:53:19.82 I don't think that's a Southern Hemisphere people.
01:53:19.82 --> 01:53:20.82 Sure.
01:53:20.82 --> 01:53:21.82 Yeah.

01:53:21.82 --> 01:53:21.82 Yeah.
01:53:21.82 --> 01:53:22.82 Because it's summer down there.
01:53:22.82 --> 01:53:23.82 It's going to be summertime soon.
01:53:23.82 --> 01:53:27.82 Down in New Zealand and Australia and South America.
01:53:27.82 --> 01:53:28.82 Yeah.
01:53:28.82 --> 01:53:30.82 And the Hawaii people as well.
01:53:30.82 --> 01:53:32.82 From Hawaii we don't know about that kind.
01:53:32.82 --> 01:53:36.82 And that's why you're saying, you don't understand what a hoodie is.
01:53:36.82 --> 01:53:37.82 Yeah.
01:53:37.82 --> 01:53:38.82 From Hawaii.
01:53:38.82 --> 01:53:39.82 Like we kind of...
01:53:39.82 --> 01:53:41.82 We know what a hoodie is.
01:53:41.82 --> 01:53:41.82 Yeah.
01:53:41.82 --> 01:53:42.82 We don't know what a hoodie is.
01:53:42.82 --> 01:53:43.82 We don't know.
01:53:43.82 --> 01:53:44.82 Yeah.
01:53:44.82 --> 01:53:44.82 So we're making hoodies.
01:53:44.82 --> 01:53:45.82 Yes.
01:53:45.82 --> 01:53:50.82 So we made it with consultation from Jocco and then some New England people.
01:53:50.82 --> 01:53:54.82 We got hoodies on the way as well.
01:53:54.82 --> 01:53:57.82 And women's t-shirts as well.
01:53:57.82 --> 01:53:58.82 Yeah.
01:53:58.82 --> 01:54:00.82 I was explaining to Echo that in New England.
01:54:00.82 --> 01:54:09.82 Like a hoodie is like something you wear every single day for nine months out of the year.
01:54:09.82 --> 01:54:10.82 You wear a hoodie.

01:54:13.82 --> 01:54:14.82 I'm putting on a hoodie.
01:54:14.82 --> 01:54:15.82 Yeah.
01:54:15.82 --> 01:54:16.82 That's what you do.
01:54:16.82 --> 01:54:17.82 Yes.
01:54:17.82 --> 01:54:19.82 So we got to make.
01:54:19.82 --> 01:54:22.82 And representing with their hoodie.

01:54:30.82 --> 01:54:32.82 You know the kind of where she wears a hoodie every single day.
01:54:32.82 --> 01:54:34.82 Even when it's not cold.
01:54:34.82 --> 01:54:35.82 Hmm.
01:54:35.82 --> 01:54:37.82 She'll be like, it's like a comfort zone thing, you know.

01:54:38.82 --> 01:54:40.82 But I don't even know how many.
01:54:40.82 --> 01:54:44.82 She even took Greg trains victory hoodie.

01:54:58.82 --> 01:55:01.82 I think that's a fair amount of time to say.

01:55:52.82 --> 01:55:56.82 If you don't want to read it because you know, time you just want to listen to it while you're in the in the traffic jam.
01:55:56.82 --> 01:55:59.82 Then just buy the audio book and you'll be good to go.
01:55:59.82 --> 01:56:00.82 So appreciate that.
01:56:00.82 --> 01:56:04.82 And then also if you dig that extreme ownership, you dig that concept.
01:56:04.82 --> 01:56:09.82 You can come out to something we're having here in Southern California in San Diego called the
01:56:09.82 --> 01:56:13.82 Master, the extreme ownership master. We're going to be talking about leadership.
01:56:13.82 --> 01:56:19.82 We're going to be talking about how to take the lessons that we learned in combat, which have been proven in combat.
01:56:19.82 --> 01:56:25.82 And how you can apply those same lessons doing leadership in business leadership in life.
01:56:25.82 --> 01:56:28.82 So we got a bunch of you are coming to us.
01:56:28.82 --> 01:56:30.82 And it's awesome.
01:56:30.82 --> 01:56:34.82 So and I had somebody email me the other day.
01:56:34.82 --> 01:56:38.82 And it said, say, hey, listen, I just wanted to let you know.
01:56:38.82 --> 01:56:42.82 I don't come into the master, but in the event, I don't get to meet you there.
01:56:42.82 --> 01:56:44.82 Then, you know, I just want to let you know.
01:56:44.82 --> 01:56:48.82 I really appreciate, you know, the podcast and the book and all that.
01:56:48.82 --> 01:56:49.82 And I didn't even respond yet.
01:56:49.82 --> 01:56:51.82 I don't think I could a lot of emails.
01:56:51.82 --> 01:56:52.82 But let me tell you something.
01:56:52.82 --> 01:56:54.82 If you come to the master, we're hanging out.
01:56:54.82 --> 01:56:58.82 It's not going to be one of these gigs where, you know, I'm back in the green room.
01:56:58.82 --> 01:57:00.82 We're going to go out, um, getting in character.
01:57:00.82 --> 01:57:03.82 Well, no, I, this is my character.
01:57:03.82 --> 01:57:04.82 And I won't be backstage.
01:57:04.82 --> 01:57:06.82 I'll be in, I'll be sitting at a table with you.
01:57:06.82 --> 01:57:09.82 I'll be talking. I'll be, and lace can be doing the same thing.
01:57:09.82 --> 01:57:14.82 So that's one of the major differentiators we want to have in this thing is that,
01:57:14.82 --> 01:57:17.82 because, you know, late for night go to these events all the time because we speak at them.
01:57:17.82 --> 01:57:20.82 You know, leadership events and conferences and all that.
01:57:20.82 --> 01:57:23.82 The biggest differentiator that we want to make is we want to be.
01:57:23.82 --> 01:57:25.82 We want to have the contact.
01:57:25.82 --> 01:57:26.82 We want to have the face to face.
01:57:26.82 --> 01:57:31.82 So if you're coming, not only are you going to meet me, we're going to kick it.
01:57:31.82 --> 01:57:32.82 We're going to be hanging out.
01:57:32.82 --> 01:57:33.82 We're going to be having dinner lunch.
01:57:33.82 --> 01:57:35.82 We're going to be going over problems when we talk about solutions.
01:57:35.82 --> 01:57:38.82 So don't think that I'm going to be.
01:57:38.82 --> 01:57:41.82 And that, and that late for is going to be all hiding in the background.
01:57:41.82 --> 01:57:42.82 No, we're going to be there.
01:57:42.82 --> 01:57:43.82 I'll be meeting you.
01:57:43.82 --> 01:57:44.82 Will we do an workout also?
01:57:44.82 --> 01:57:45.82 Some people want to try.
01:57:45.82 --> 01:57:48.82 If you train that you get to and you come out here.
01:57:48.82 --> 01:57:51.82 Come out here a little bit early or stay a little bit late.
01:57:51.82 --> 01:57:53.82 And we're going to go to the gym.
01:57:53.82 --> 01:57:54.82 We're going to go to the victory MMA.
01:57:54.82 --> 01:57:57.82 And you can challenge echelotronals to a death match.
01:57:57.82 --> 01:57:59.82 The other node will be there.
01:57:59.82 --> 01:58:00.82 We'll be there rolling.
01:58:00.82 --> 01:58:04.82 So, you know, if you, if you, if you stay Friday, if you stay Saturday,
01:58:04.82 --> 01:58:08.82 if you stay Sunday, I will be there Friday night.
01:58:08.82 --> 01:58:09.82 I'll be there Saturday day.
01:58:09.82 --> 01:58:10.82 I'll be there Sunday day.
01:58:10.82 --> 01:58:12.82 And we'll be getting it on.
01:58:12.82 --> 01:58:16.82 So come on out for that for that monster.
01:58:16.82 --> 01:58:18.82 And that'll be that'll be awesome.
01:58:18.82 --> 01:58:21.82 Also, if you can't come out to the monster,
01:58:21.82 --> 01:58:25.82 but you just want to kind of kick it and keep these things going on.
01:58:25.82 --> 01:58:27.82 And you want to join the crew.
01:58:27.82 --> 01:58:32.82 Then all you got to do is get on social media,
01:58:32.82 --> 01:58:37.82 which, which, which, which, I didn't really understand social media a year ago.
01:58:37.82 --> 01:58:39.82 You know, I didn't know what it was all about.
01:58:39.82 --> 01:58:45.82 But now what I know is I get to talk to people and I get to get to grow my knowledge from other people
01:58:45.82 --> 01:58:50.82 who, who can communicate things, who ask really good questions that I got to get research or I know an answer to
01:58:50.82 --> 01:58:53.82 and then they ask me something else and so, so that's awesome.
01:58:53.82 --> 01:58:56.82 And funny bunch of people post all kinds of funny stuff.
01:58:56.82 --> 01:58:58.82 So I'm getting entertained.
01:58:58.82 --> 01:59:01.82 And we're getting, you know, a crew.
01:59:01.82 --> 01:59:06.82 And having a bunch of people there that are like-minded and is, is, is fun to have.
01:59:06.82 --> 01:59:09.82 And so I appreciate it. If you want to find us on social media.

01:59:39.82 --> 01:59:43.82 We don't think we have time for the Q&A.
01:59:43.82 --> 01:59:45.82 We'll push that.
01:59:45.82 --> 01:59:54.82 And in the meantime, you know, again, I know we got to- I'm meeting people all over the place.

02:00:28.82 --> 02:00:34.82 So we love the fact that we get to go to places where you got people that are out there trying to kick ass,
02:00:34.82 --> 02:00:35.82 trying to crush it.
02:00:35.82 --> 02:00:40.82 And that's what propels American keeps our country strong, keeps our country free.
02:00:40.82 --> 02:00:46.82 So thank you for what you're doing in all those jobs, all you in the workforce.
